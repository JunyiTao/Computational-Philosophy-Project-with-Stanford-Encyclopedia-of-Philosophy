The Frankfurt School: Origins, Influences, and Development\n\nThe \u201cFrankfurt School\u201d of critical theory is not really a\nschool at all. It is a loosely held together tradition constituted by\nongoing debates among adherents about how best to define and develop\nthat tradition. This includes disagreements about methods, about how\nto interpret earlier figures and texts in the tradition, about whether\npast shifts in focus were advances or dead ends, and about how to\nrespond to new challenges arising from other schools of thought and\ncurrent social developments. This section tells a largely\nchronological story, focusing on the origins, influences, and key\ntexts of the Frankfurt School, and concludes with reference to ongoing\ndebates on how to inherit and continue the tradition.\n1.1 Origins and Generations\n\nIn their attempt to combine philosophy and social science in a\ncritical theory with emancipatory intent, the wide-ranging work of the\nfirst generation of the Frankfurt School was methodologically\ninnovative. They revised and updated Marxism by integrating it with\nthe work of Sigmund Freud, Max Weber, and Friedrich Nietzsche while\ndeveloping a model of radical critique that is immanently anchored in\nsocial reality. They used this model to analyze a wide range of\nphenomena \u2013 from authoritarianism as a political formation and\nas it manifests in both the nuclear family and deep-seated\npsychological dispositions, to the effects of capitalism on\npsychological, social, cultural, and political formations as well as\non the production of knowledge itself (for excellent guides, see\nThompson 2017 and Gordon et al. 2019).\n\nMax Horkheimer outlined the original research agenda for the Frankfurt\nSchool in his 1931 inaugural lecture upon becoming director of the\nInstitute for Social Research in Frankfurt (founded in 1923). He\nproposed an interdisciplinary research program combining philosophy\nand social theory with psychology, political economy, and cultural\nanalysis (Horkheimer 1931). In that way, \u201csocial\nphilosophy\u201d aims at providing an encompassing interpretation of\nsocial reality as a whole \u2013 as \u201csocial totality,\u201d to\nuse a concept central to the Marxist tradition (Jay 1984).\n\nOther key figures of the first generation include Theodor W. Adorno,\nHerbert Marcuse, and Walter Benjamin, along with Erich Fromm,\nFriedrich Pollock, Leo L\u00f6wenthal, Franz Neumann, Otto\nKirchheimer, and figures like Siegfried Kracauer, who belonged to the\nbroader circle for a few years (for rich historical accounts, see Jay\n1973, Buck-Morss 1977, Dubiel 1978, Wiggershaus 1986, Wheatland 2009).\nThe work of the largely Jewish members of the first generation was\ndeeply marked by the rise of National Socialism, the experience of\nexile, and, for some of its inner circle, their return to Germany\nafter 1945. After the Nazis closed the Institute, Horkheimer, who had\nalready moved it to Geneva, re-established it at Columbia University\nin 1934, where he was soon joined by Pollock, Marcuse, and\nL\u00f6wenthal, while Adorno did not emigrate to the US until 1938.\nHorkheimer, Adorno, and Pollock moved the Institute from New York to\nLos Angeles in 1941. Those three reestablished the Institute in\nGermany after the War, with Horkeimer as director from 1951 to 1958\nand Adorno from 1958 to 1969. Key figures who worked with first\ngeneration figures during this period emerged as the second\ngeneration: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Alfred Schmidt, Albrecht Wellmer,\nOskar Negt, and Claus Offe.\n\nHabermas was the leading figure of this second generation, taking up\nHorkheimer\u2019s chair in Frankfurt in 1964 before moving to a\nresearch post in Starnberg in 1971. Habermas returned to Frankfurt in\n1981, retiring from this position in 1994. Axel Honneth worked closely\nwith Habermas in the 1980s and took over the chair in social\nphilosophy in Frankfurt in 1996; Honneth was also director of, and\nlargely responsible for the revival of, the Institute for Social\nResearch in Frankfurt from 2001 to 2018. He is considered a leading\nfigure in the third generation, along with Seyla Benhabib, Nancy\nFraser, and Christoph Menke (Anderson 2000, Allen 2010). Going beyond\nthe second and third generations of the Frankfurt School, there are\nfar too many figures to list; and the focal points for critical theory\nin this tradition have expanded, both geographically \u2013 with\nprominent figures in the United States and an active reception in\nLatin America \u2013 and thematically \u2013 for example, with a\nturn to feminism (see\n \u00a74.1.1).\n1.2 Influences\n\nThe first generation of the Frankfurt School took inspiration from an\nearlier generation of critical theorists: \u201cLeft Hegelians\u201d\nin Germany who, after Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\u2019s death in\n1831, applied his philosophy critically to social and political\nphenomena like religion and the state, maintaining that the\nprogressive realization of freedom in history that was central to\nHegel\u2019s thought was not yet complete and required a fundamental\ntransformation of the status quo. Karl Marx became the most\ninfluential of this group. In a materialist transformation of\nHegel\u2019s thought, Marx analyzed the concrete conditions for\nrealizing autonomy for all and viewed philosophy itself as conditioned\nby socioeconomic developments. By developing a critique of political\neconomy in order to analyze the nature of capitalism and the\npossibilities for revolutionary social transformation, Marx set the\nstandard for future generations of critical theory by combining\nradical philosophy with a critique of the best available social\nscience of the day in the pursuit of emancipation.\n\nMarx\u2019s early writings, in the 1840s, were written when\ncapitalist modernization was only just beginning in Germany, but he\nalready saw contradictory social relations as the objective condition\nof capitalist society and exploited workers as a nascent revolutionary\nforce. By the time the Frankfurt School began working out a critical\ntheory of society in the 1930s much had changed as Germany had emerged\nas a leading economic power in an industrialized, capitalist Europe.\nFrankfurt School theorists were committed to social transformation,\nbut the vehicle for change Marx identified \u2013 workers in advanced\ncapitalist states like Germany \u2013 not only lacked revolutionary\nconsciousness, but would soon embrace fascist politics when faced with\neconomic crisis and mass unemployment. Radical social theorists would\nneed revised analytical tools.\n\nTo study the psychology of individuals and groups along with social\nand cultural influences on that psychology, they could not rely on the\nthen-dominant dogmatic versions of scientific Marxism (Pensky 2019).\nTo understand how social conflicts get denied or repressed, and why\nindividuals and groups turn to authoritarian politics that seem not to\nalign with their class interests, they turned to Freudian\npsychoanalysis. In contrast to orthodox Marxism, they analyzed\nindividual and group psychology, changes in the modern family, and the\ncultural \u201csuperstructure\u201d of society, not just the\nmaterial \u201cbase,\u201d in order to understand how the rise of\n\u201cmass culture\u201d and the decline of authority figures in the\nfamily led to the decline of critical capacities both in the\nindividual psyche and in society generally. This effort to combine\nMarx and Freud is one of the distinctive features of the Frankfurt\nSchool; exactly how to integrate psychoanalytic theory into critical\ntheory has been a long-standing debate (Marcuse 1955, Whitebook 1995,\nHonneth 2010, Part IV; Allen and O\u2019Connor 2019, Allen 2021).\n\nIn addition to incorporating insights from Freud\u2019s\npsychoanalytic theory, early critical theorists drew on Max\nWeber\u2019s social theory to analyze contemporary society. Crucial\nhere was Weber\u2019s theory of rationalization, which stressed the\ngrowing dominance of instrumental rationality, or means-end reasoning,\nthrough the expanding bureaucratization of society. Weber posited a\nloss of freedom, due to the \u201ciron cage\u201d of modern\nbureaucracy, and a loss of meaning generated by the\n\u201cdisenchantment of the world\u201d associated with\nsecularization. Weber\u2019s work was crucial for Horkheimer and\nAdorno\u2019s critique of instrumental reason (1947) as well as for\nHabermas\u2019s later theory of communicative action (1981).\n\nIn synthesizing Marx and Weber, the first generation of critical\ntheory was heavily influenced by Georg Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s attempt\nto do the same in his ground-breaking 1923 essay \u201cReification\nand the Consciousness of the Proletariat\u201d (see Brunkhorst 1983).\nRadically extending Marx\u2019s analysis of commodities by analyzing\nhow they transform the character of society as a whole, and drawing on\nWeber to describe a process of rationalization that extends to all\naspects of life, Luk\u00e1cs used the term \u201creification\u201d\n(see 3.2 below) to describe how the commodity form transforms the\nconsciousness of those living in capitalist societies, who then see\nall social relations, even their relation to themselves, as taking on\na \u201cthing-like\u201d character.\n\nThe classic philosophical influences on the Frankfurt School range\nwidely, from Immanuel Kant and German Idealism to Nietzsche. In some\nform, Kant\u2019s appeal to M\u00fcndigkeit (autonomy,\nmaturity, responsibility) in his famous essay \u201cWhat is\nEnlightenment?\u201d \u2013 with its call for freely and publicly\nmaking use of reason \u2013 animates the ideal of emancipation\nthroughout the work of the Frankfurt School, along with the Kantian\nconception of the critique of reason: the use of reason to reflect on\nthe limits of reason. But its adherents follow Hegel and Marx in\nfocusing on the social, cultural, and material conditions for\nachieving autonomy and insisting that reason is always socially and\nhistorically embedded. For first generation critical theorists, this\nentailed a critique of Kant\u2019s own individualist and repressive\nunderstanding of autonomy as it arises within capitalist social\nconditions (Horkheimer 1933) and formalizes the domination of our own\ninner nature (Horkheimer and Adorno 1947, Excursus II, Adorno 1963a,\nChs. 10\u201311). Some later critical theorists have engaged more\npositively with Kant, as in Habermas\u2019s attempt to\n\u201cdetranscendentalize\u201d core aspects of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental philosophy (Habermas 2005, Ch. 2) and Rainer\nForst\u2019s Kantian constructivism in moral and political theory\n(Forst 2007, 2021a).\n\nHegel\u2019s work has been a continual reference point for Frankfurt\nSchool philosophers, with key figures in the tradition \u2013 from\nMarcuse (1941) and Adorno (1963b) to Benhabib (1986, Part I) and\nHonneth (1992, 2001, 2011) \u2013 contributing both substantive\nstudies and relying on Hegel\u2019s methodology either for its\nholistic approach or as a paradigm of immanent critique while\neschewing his metaphysical, teleological, and reconciliatory\ntendencies. Honneth first built on Hegel\u2019s account of the\nstruggle for recognition and the intersubjective conditions for living\nan autonomous life (Honneth 1992) before developing his own account of\nthe practices and institutions of modern ethical life that realize\nfreedom in a way that goes beyond its liberal and Kantian\ninterpretations (Honneth 2011). Rahel Jaeggi builds on Hegel\u2019s\nmethod of immanent critique in her account of progressive social\nchange as learning processes in response to problems, contradictions,\nand crises that arise from within ethically thick forms of life\n(Jaeggi 2014).\n\nIn aiming to explain irrationality, the first generation extended the\ncritique of reason, going beyond rationalist philosophers like Kant\nand Hegel to figures like Freud and Nietzsche. They turned to\nNietzsche in particular as a critic of modern bourgeois culture and\nthe violent formation of individual subjectivity. Engagement with\nNietzsche\u2019s thought extends from early essays by Horkheimer\n(1933, 1936a) through Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s shift toward doing\ncritical theory in a more Nietzschean spirit with the genealogy of\nreason in Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), and\nHabermas\u2019s more critical take on Nietzsche\u2019s supposed\nirrationalism (1985, Ch. 3\u20134), to contemporary authors such as\nMenke, who returns to Nietzsche as a positive reference point in the\ncritique of the repressive dimensions of the modern ideal of equality\n(2000) and for a genealogical analysis of the modern subject who\ndemands rights (2015).\n\nOne way of categorizing work by later generations of the Frankfurt\nSchool is to note how, even when drawing on a range of theoretical\nresources, they give pride of place to the legacy of a particular\nfigure like Kant, Hegel, Marx, or Nietzsche (often via Foucault), or\nhow they combine approaches. For instance, Honneth and Jaeggi are more\nHegelian while Forst is more Kantian, and Benhabib is, like Habermas,\na Hegelianized Kantian, and Fraser draws heavily on Marx in recent\nwork while Amy Allen and Martin Saar are influenced by Foucauldian\ngenealogy. The latter is part of a broader engagement between the\nFrankfurt School and post-structuralism, ranging from the more\ncritical (Habermas 1985) through the more sympathetic (Honneth 1985,\nMenke 1988, 2000) to attempts to combine deconstructive and\nreconstructive approaches to critical theory (McCarthy 1991; see also\nFraser 1989).\n\nIt is not easy to capture key features of an intellectual tradition\nshaped by such a variety of influences, including multiple figures\nwhose own thinking changed over time, and a body of work addressing a\nvast range of topics spanning from the 1930s to the present. The rest\nof this section outlines some of the main arguments and focal points\nof key texts by key figures. It is not meant to be exhaustive, but to\nidentify influential methodological approaches, arguments, and themes\nthat are indicative of the work of the Frankfurt School and still\nprovide important reference points for contemporary debates.\n1.3 Critical Theory versus Traditional Theory\n\nOne largely undisputed reference for defining Frankfurt School\ncritical theory is Horkheimer\u2019s 1937 essay \u201cTraditional\nand Critical Theory,\u201d in which he defines critical theory by\ncontrasting it with traditional theories that take the existing social\norder as given. Social sciences do this, for example, when they model\nthemselves after the natural sciences in attempting to descriptively\nmirror a given set of facts or establish law-like generalizations. The\npoint is not that empirical social research is invalid, but that\ntraditional theories fail to analyze the broader social context in\nwhich they are embedded. This form of \u201cpositivism\u201d views\nscience as a purely theoretical undertaking divorced from practical\ninterests even while it actually serves a particular social function\nin relying on established concepts and categories in a way that\nreinforces dominant ideologies and power structures. In that way, the\nforms of knowledge production that we rely on for insight into the\nsocial order become obstacles to social change.\n\nCritical theory, by contrast, reflects on the context of its own\norigins and aims to be a transformative force within that context. It\nexplicitly embraces an interdisciplinary methodology that aims to\nbridge the gap between empirical research and the kind of\nphilosophical thinking needed to grasp the overall historical\nsituation and mediate between specialized empirical disciplines.\nCritical theory aims not merely to describe social reality, but to\ngenerate insights into the forces of domination operating within\nsociety in a way that can inform practical action and stimulate\nchange. It aims to unite theory and practice, so that the theorist\nforms \u201ca dynamic unity with the oppressed class\u201d (1937a\n[1972, 215]) that is guided by an emancipatory interest \u2013\ndefined negatively as an interest in the \u201cabolition of social\ninjustice\u201d (ibid., 242) and positively as an interest in\nestablishing \u201creasonable conditions of life\u201d (ibid., 199).\n\u201cThe theory never aims simply at an increase of knowledge as\nsuch,\u201d but at \u201cemancipation from slavery\u201d (1937b\n[1972, 246]) in the broadest sense of eliminating all forms of\ndomination. The critique of traditional social science was further\ndeveloped by Adorno and Habermas in the so-called positivism dispute\nin German sociology (Adorno et al. 1969, Wellmer 1969) and\nHorkheimer\u2019s model of critical theory continues to inform\ndiscussions about how social critique might be carried out today in a\nvariety of contexts (Outlaw 2005, Collins 2019, 57\u201365).\n1.4 Studies on Authoritarianism and Mass Culture\n\nNothing epitomizes the Frankfurt School\u2019s interdisciplinary\napproach to analyzing irrational elements of modern society better\nthan their studies of authoritarianism, beginning with studies of\nGerman society in the 1930s and continuing with studies of the U.S. in\nthe 1940s. This work combined philosophy, social theory, and\npsychoanalytic theory with empirical research.\n\nThe first substantial foray was Studies in Authority and the\nFamily (Horkheimer 1936b), the product of five years of research\ncarried out by members of the Institute as part of the research agenda\noutlined by Horkheimer when he became director in 1930. In an essay\narticulating the study\u2019s theoretical framework, Erich Fromm\nargued that the \u201cdrives underlying the authoritarian\ncharacter\u201d are \u201cthe pleasure of obedience, submission, and\nthe surrender of one\u2019s personality\u201d along with\n\u201caggression against the defenseless and sympathy with the\npowerful\u201d (Fromm 1936 [2020, 39, 41]). A main concern of the\nStudies was that the nuclear family had lost the power it\nonce had to counter other socializing forces, which could now more\ndirectly influence the individual, and that individuals who view the\nworld as governed by irrational forces submit to powerful leaders who\nease their feelings of powerlessness.\n\nThe focus on authoritarianism continued into exile, with Neumann and\nKirchheimer focusing more on distinctly political phenomena such as\nlaw, the state structure, and competing political groups under the\nNazi regime (see Neumann 1944, Scheuerman 1996). Neumann and\nKirchheimer were the main legal and political analysts of the first\ngeneration, but were outside the inner circle and less influential on\nthe trajectory the Frankfurt School took in the 1940s (see Scheuerman\n1994 and Buchstein 2020 for attempts to revive interest in their legal\nand political analysis).\n\nThe work on authoritarianism that the Institute is most well-known for\ncame with the publication of The Authoritarian Personality\n(1950), the result of research conducted by Adorno in collaboration\nwith a team of psychologists at the University of California,\nBerkeley. The aim was to identify personality types that might be\nsusceptible to authoritarianism, based not on explicit commitments to\nfascist political movements but on psychological characteristics and\nsocial attitudes (measured on an \u201cF-scale\u201d). The\nresearchers posited that individuals with an authoritarian personality\ntend to exhibit traits such as rigid conformity to conventional norms,\na tendency toward stereotypical thinking, a preference for strong\nauthority figures and disdain for perceived weakness, a preoccupation\nwith power and status, and a propensity for prejudice and hostility\ntowards minority groups. The book explored the link between\nauthoritarianism and antisemitism, highlighting the role of\nscapegoating and the projection of repressed aggression onto targeted\nminority groups.\n\nThe text was published in a series edited by Horkheimer, titled\nStudies in Prejudice, along with other innovative studies\nsuch as Prophets of Deceit: A Study of the Techniques of the\nAmerican Agitator (1949), a psychoanalytic analysis of the\nrhetoric and tropes of American demagogues authored by Frankfurt\nSchool member Leo L\u00f6wenthal and Norbert Guterman. If The\nAuthoritarian Personality studied the kinds of people potentially\nreceptive to the messages of authoritarian leaders, Prophets of\nDeceit studied the content of the messaging itself. Adorno would\nlater follow up on all these themes \u2013 both the form and content\nof fascist agitation and the social and psychological conditions under\nwhich it can succeed (1951b, 1967a).\n\nThe Authoritarian Personality had a major impact on the field\nof political sociology, inspiring a wave of similar studies and\ncommentary. The recent resurgence of authoritarian populism has\ninspired renewed interest in Frankfurt School analysis of\nauthoritarianism (see\n Section 4.2\n below) in conjunction with publication of new editions of some of the\nclassic texts along with previously untranslated work by Kracauer on\ntotalitarian propaganda dating from the late 1930s (Kracauer 2013\n[2022]) and a 1967 lecture by Adorno on \u201cAspects of the New\nRight-Wing Extremism\u201d (Adorno 1967a [2020]).\n\nOne point of continuity between the studies of authoritarianism and\nFrankfurt School cultural analysis more broadly was the idea that\n\u201cmass culture\u201d was one of the powerful forces playing an\nincreasing role in the direct socialization of individuals, a role\nthat led to the \u201cdisappearance of the inner life\u201d of the\nindividual (Horkheimer 1941) and an increasing loss of the ability to\nimagine a world any different than the existing one. In its various\nforms, this general thesis was common to Horkheimer, Adorno, and\nMarcuse in their critiques of mass culture from the 1930s to the\n1960s.\n\nMore generally, the Frankfurt School is known for its analysis of\npopular culture. By contrast to orthodox Marxist dismissal of cultural\nanalysis for focusing on the less consequential\n\u201csuperstructure\u201d of society, Frankfurt School theorists\nattentively analyzed the form and content of cultural objects along\nwith the genres and modes of producing works of art and popular\nculture. In an early essay titled \u201cMass Ornament\u201d (1927),\nKracauer argued that analyzing the \u201cinconspicuous surface-level\nexpressions\u201d of an epoch, by virtue of their \u201cunconscious\nnature,\u201d can disclose its \u201cfundamental substance\u201d\nand \u201cunheeded impulses\u201d (1927 [1975, 75]). Adorno would\nlater maintain that \u201ccultural criticism must become social\nphysiognomy\u201d (1951a [1967, 30]), a method he pursued in his\ninterpretations of works of literature and music by interpreting the\nsurface features and forms of various cultural artifacts in relation\nto underlying social conditions as a mode of disclosive critique.\n\nThe more pessimistic analysis of mass culture of Horkheimer, Adorno,\nand Marcuse can be distinguished from the more optimistic views\ndeveloped by Kracauer and Walter Benjamin. Benjamin posited, in his\nfamous essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Technological\nReproducibility\u201d (1936), that the rise of technologies for\nmechanical reproduction, such as photography and film, led to the\ndecline of the \u201caura\u201d surrounding traditional works of art\n\u2013 the \u201cauthenticity\u201d associated with the unique\npresence of the original in space and time \u2013 in part because it\nmakes no sense to talk about the \u201coriginal\u201d version of a\nphotograph. The resulting changes in perception and modes of\ncollective experience and participation in cultural production could,\nBenjamin hoped, also bring about political forms of art and a more\ngeneral democratization of culture. He contrasted this emancipatory\npotential of mass culture, through a politicization of aesthetics,\nwith the aestheticization of politics under fascism (Buck-Morss 1992).\nAdorno expressed his disagreement in an earlier letter to Benjamin and\nin published work (Adorno 1936, 1938). As Wellmer puts it, \u201cin\ntechnologized mass culture, Benjamin sees elements of an antidote to\nthe psychic destruction of society, whereas Adorno regards it above\nall as a medium of conformism and psychic manipulation\u201d (1985/86\n[1991, 32\u201333]). While Benjamin placed hope in mass culture,\nAdorno saw it lying in the kind of autonomous art that resists\nreconciling subjects to their social world, instead offering a kind of\n\u201cpromise of happiness\u201d in a transfigured future that lies\nbeyond that social world (Adorno 1970, Finlayson 2015, Gordon\n2023).\n1.5 The Dialectic of Enlightenment\n\nThe critique of mass culture took its most dramatic form in the\nchapter on the \u201cculture industry\u201d in Horkheimer and\nAdorno\u2019s Dialectic of Enlightenment (first circulated\nin 1944 and published in 1947). They introduced the term\n\u201cculture industry\u201d to underline the fact that \u201cmass\nculture\u201d is not something \u201cthe masses\u201d spontaneously\ngenerate (Adorno 1967b [1991, 98]), but is manufactured using the same\nstandardized and profit-oriented methods as any industrial production\nmethod. In this sense, culture is no longer a relatively autonomous\nrealm of meaning (that might aim, at its best, at beauty, freedom, and\ntruth) or source of critical awareness, but is thoroughly commodified\nby the \u201cdistraction factories\u201d of the culture industry.\n\u201cCultural entities typical of the culture industry are no longer\nalso commodities, they are commodities through and\nthrough\u201d (ibid., 129). Entertainment replaces experience,\nnumbing the audience\u2019s capacity for critical thought and\nreconciling them to the status quo in a form of domination far more\nsubtle than direct tyranny.\n\nIn this way, Dialectic of Enlightenment, which is perhaps the\nmost influential text by Frankfurt School philosophers, analyzes two\nforms of mass society, fascist Germany and the United States, focusing\nprimarily on the latter. Co-authored by Horkheimer and Adorno between\n1939 and 1944 at the height of Nazi rule and World War II, the text\nopens with these lines:\n\nEnlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of\nthought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and\ninstalling them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth is\nradiant with triumphant calamity (1947 [2002, 1]).\n\n\nThe book is a genealogy of reason that traces its self-destruction\nfrom the dawn of human history to the present. Reason was supposed to\nliberate human beings. Instead, in the dominant form it takes as\ninstrumental rationality, it has become the primary instrument of\ntheir domination. With reason taking this form, humans lose their\ncapacity for critical reflection as their thinking is increasingly\noriented solely toward self-preservation within a system in which they\nare powerless. \u201cThought is reified as an autonomous, automatic\nprocess, aping the machine it has itself produced, so that it can\nfinally be replaced by the machine\u201d (ibid., 19).\n\nThe root of the catastrophic dynamic lies not just with modernity or\ncapitalism, but goes back to humanity\u2019s earliest attempts to\ndominate nature. A core thesis of the book is that myth and\nenlightenment are entwined. The process of enlightenment began with\nthe earliest attempts to overcome \u201cmythic fear\u201d as a way\nof explaining the unknown and mitigating threats from nature. This\nanthropological claim about enlightenment is combined with a\nhistorical claim about the Enlightenment and the rise of modern\nscience and technology. This is when instrumental rationality truly\ncomes to dominate, as means-end calculation is the kind of reasoning\nrequired for capitalist production and efficient bureaucracy.\n\u201cEnlightenment is totalitarian\u201d (ibid., 50), Adorno and\nHorkheimer argue; it subsumes everything under its dissolvent\nrationality. In this way, enlightenment reverts back to myth.\n\nThe book represents a shift away from the critique of political\neconomy, indebted to Marx, to the critique of instrumental reason,\nindebted to Weber (Benhabib 1986, 149\u2013163). Although this shift\nis sometimes attributed to the growing pessimism of its authors during\nNational Socialism, it was also motivated by Pollock\u2019s analysis\nof the shift from nineteenth-century liberal capitalism to\n\u201cstate capitalism\u201d: increased intervention by the state\ninto the economy meant that the primacy of the economy posited by Marx\nhad been replaced by the primacy of politics (1941). This claim\nsupported the focus in Dialectic of Enlightenment on the\nadministered control of society by the state apparatus. The book\npaints a bleak picture of a society in which people live\n\u201ctotally administered lives\u201d under the sway of efficient\nand calculating institutions. For the sake of self-preservation, they\nadapt themselves entirely to this apparatus. All the while the culture\nindustry, as an \u201corgan of mass deception,\u201d keeps them\nentertained at the price of numbing their critical capacities,\nproducing conformity, and undermining any sense of individuality or\ncapacity for autonomy. The book also represents a shift away from the\nearlier idea of critical theory as interdisciplinary social theory,\nwhich could marshal the findings of empirical social science toward\nthe practical aim of emancipation, and more toward speculative\nhistory. In the story they tell, the effects of domination are so\nubiquitous that every form of scientific knowledge is corrupted.\n\nIf Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s Dialectic of Enlightenment\nwas supposed to provide the grounds for a positive concept of\nenlightenment \u2013 as they maintained in its preface (1947 [2002,\nxviii]) \u2013 many critics have wondered what that is supposed to be\n(Wellmer 1983). Habermas would later argue that the authors needed to\nleave \u201cat least one rational criterion intact for their\nexplanation of the corruption of all rational criteria\u201d\nin order to \u201cset the normative foundations of critical social\ntheory;\u201d but they failed to do so (1985 [1987, 127\u20139]; see\nalso Benhabib 1986).\n\nReappraisals of the text in recent decades range from defending its\napproach as a form of world-disclosive critique (Kompridis 2006) that\nreveals our familiar social world as pathological by using techniques\nlike \u201crhetorical condensation\u201d (Honneth 1998), to reading\nit as developing a dialectical conception of progress \u2013 not\nsimply a history of decline \u2013 aimed at making us more aware of\nthe inevitable entanglement of reason with power (Allen 2014, 2016),\nand attempts to build on the chapter on antisemitism, which analyzes\nits social function in providing a \u201crelease valve\u201d that\nallows rage to be \u201cvented on those who are both conspicuous and\nunprotected\u201d (1947 [2002, 140]), thereby stabilizing domination\nby channeling potential resistance to social suffering into hatred of\na group (Rabinbach 2000, Rensmann 2017).\n\nHerbert Marcuse\u2019s influential book One-Dimensional Man\n(1964) \u2013 best summarized by its subtitle, Studies in the\nIdeology of Advanced Industrial Society \u2013 can be read as an\nattempt to update Dialectic of Enlightenment in the form of a\ndiagnosis of U.S. society and its perfected mechanisms of pacification\nand social control, ranging from art, sexuality, and politics to\nphilosophy and the very act of thinking. Marcuse argues that all forms\nof critical thought and practice, having been wholly integrated into\nthe wasteful, dehumanizing, profit-seeking, imperialist logic of\nadvanced capitalism, are subsumed by one-dimensional ideology, a\n\u201cflattening out of the antagonism between culture and social\nreality\u201d (61).\n\nMarcuse developed his influential concept of \u201crepressive\ndesublimation\u201d to explain how the manipulated need for instant\ngratification has sanitized any transgressive forces within the\ndomains of sexuality and art. Prior to the rise of the \u201caffluent\nsociety,\u201d art contained a transcendent capacity in the sense\nthat it thought of, engaged with, and appropriated the idea of\nbreaking out of the world in which one lived and embodied the hope for\na better one to replace it. Within late capitalism, art has lost this\ncritical aspect and dissolved into consumer culture and technological\nrationality, masking the \u201csurplus repression\u201d that shapes\nhuman instincts and needs in line with the functional requirements of\nsocial domination and the reproduction of the status quo.\n\nMarcuse\u2019s work has been criticized for its totalizing diagnosis\nof domination, his reliance on an objectivist account of human nature\nand needs, and the paternalistic or even authoritarian implications\nthat possibly result from combining these two elements (Jaeggi 2014\n[2018, 104\u2013108]). Nonetheless, it has remained an important\nreference point for the critique of technology (Feenberg 2023a, 2023b,\nFong 2016, Ch. 5) and of false needs, and of new right-wing forms of\n\u201crepressive desublimation\u201d that affirm the status quo in a\ntransgressive mode (Brown 2019, 165\u2013169). Regardless of how one\ntoday assesses Marcuse\u2019s concrete analyses, his work exemplifies\na tension that all critical theories have to address between the\ndominating forces of one-dimensionality and the possibility of\nbreaking free of them.\n\nFirst-generation critical theorists posited various responses to their\nown bleak diagnoses of society from the 1940s to the 1960s. Marcuse\nsupported rebellious social movements in the 1960s and 1970s, in\ncontrast to other leading representatives of critical theory who kept\na conspicuous distance. In One-Dimensional Man, he placed\nhope for overcoming the repressive, one-dimensional society in a\n\u201cGreat Refusal\u201d to abide by its norms, as carried out by\nthe \u201csubstratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and\npersecuted of other races and other colors, the unemployed and the\nunemployable\u201d (1964, 256). He later expressed solidarity with,\nand saw as examples of this refusal in, both the global student\nmovement (1968, 119) and the feminist movement with its aim of\novercoming dominant forms of aggressive masculinity (1974). He\nlikewise praised counter-cultural movements for expressing sexual,\nmoral, and political rebellion in a non-aggressive form of life that\nmight generate a total change in values (1967). For Marcuse,\nemancipation involves a new morality that fulfills the vital needs for\njoy and happiness and encompasses an aesthetic-erotic dimension that\nis foreshadowed in alternative artistic tastes and new social and\ncultural practices. While Horkheimer and Adorno were less supportive\nof rebellious social movements, they did become important\ninstitutional figures and public intellectuals after their return to\nGermany (M\u00fcller-Doohm 2003, part IV; Demirovi\u0107 2016).\nAdorno\u2019s radio addresses in particular can be viewed as an\nattempt to educate the public for autonomy and so as a kind of\nresponse to their own bleak diagnoses of society.\n\nBut the core of Adorno\u2019s response, from the early essay on the\nculture industry to his posthumously published Aesthetic\nTheory (1970), was to posit that \u201cautonomous\u201d or\n\u201cauthentic\u201d art, by contrast to the products of the\nculture industry, maintains a utopian impulse insofar as it points\nbeyond, and provides a moment of resistance to, the status quo. For\nexample, atonal music by composers like Arnold Schoenberg generates\ndissonance in the listener by challenging the unity of the whole found\nin more harmonious music. Adorno maintained that such art, in\nchallenging aesthetic norms and conventions, can provide aesthetic\nexperiences that are resistant to the homogenizing forces of the\nculture industry. Critics of this turn to the aesthetic have wondered\nhow this is supposed to provide a sound basis for a critical theory of\nsociety (Benhabib 1986, 222).\n\nBut one can argue that Adorno\u2019s later work was an attempt to\npush against that kind of grounding for critical theory. The title of\nAdorno\u2019s 1966 magnum opus, Negative Dialectics (1966a),\nrefers to a methodology that takes from traditional Hegelian\ndialectics the emphasis on difference and mediation but abandons the\nattempt to overcome difference through a unifying synthesis. Instead,\ntaking up an argument already developed in Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, Adorno argues that \u201cidentity thinking\u201d\nand the \u201cidentity principle\u201d have been at the basis of\nhumanity\u2019s destructive project of cognitive as well as practical\ndomination of external as well as internal nature, thereby linking the\nphilosophical to the social oppression of particularity. Adorno\nrejects \u201cidentity thinking\u201d in favor of affirming the\nnegative, namely \u201cnon-identity,\u201d that is, the irreducible\nparticularity of objects, experiences, and persons that cannot be\nsubsumed under concepts.\n\nThis approach undermines the totalizing aspirations of theoretical\nsystems in philosophy as traditionally understood. The struggle to\nrecognize that which is nonidentical is not only an epistemological\nbut also an ethical and political project that seeks to do justice to\nboth the object and the subject of cognition in their irreducible\nindividuality (Bernstein 2001). Linking epistemology and the\nphilosophy of language to critical theory of society, this leads\nAdorno to reject not only Hegel\u2019s affirmative synthesis but also\nHeideggerian ontology and Kantian dualism. Methodologically, Adorno\nexplores alternative ways of thinking about how to use and develop\nphilosophical concepts, taking up the Benjaminian notion of\nconstellation and developing \u201ccritical models\u201d in order to\narticulate the complexity of experience, and suffering, without\nreducing or constraining it. In Adorno\u2019s view, negative\ndialectics is a form of immanent critique engaged in a dynamic and\ntransformative process, as it \u201cmust transform the concepts which\nit brings, as it were, from outside into those which the object has of\nitself, into what the object, left to itself, seeks to be, and\nconfront it with what it is\u201d (Adorno 1957 [1976, 69]). In his\ncultural criticism and interventions in public debates, Adorno follows\nthis paradigm by exploring how concrete experiences exemplify a form\nof social domination that is obscured by mass culture but also open up\nthe possibility of transcending reified consciousness by articulating\nthe internal contradictions within social reality.\n1.6 The Communicative Turn\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas, who worked closely with Horkheimer and Adorno in\nthe 1950s until he fell out of favor with Horkheimer for seeming too\nradical, inherited one of the central claims of the Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, namely that Enlightenment is inseparable from the\nself-critique of Enlightenment, while also insisting on the\ncontext-transcending force of reason embedded in everyday\npractice.\n\nTwo works from the 1960s established his status as a leading figure in\nthe second generation: The Structural Transformation of the Public\nSphere (1962) and Knowledge and Human Interests (1968b).\nIn the former, Habermas provides a historical and conceptual\nreconstruction of the idea of the public sphere in which subjects\nrecognize each other as equals, submit to the \u201cforce of the\nbetter argument,\u201d and subject legislation to the public use of\nreason. Against the backdrop of its emergence in eighteenth-century\nEuropean societies, Habermas identifies the internal contradictions of\nthe public sphere under the conditions of capitalism and traces its\ndecline under the combined pressure of mass culture and mass media\nthat has gradually transformed a reasoning public into passive\nconsumers \u2013 a claim consistent with the \u201cculture\nindustry\u201d thesis.\n\nCritics argued that Habermas\u2019s historical narrative of decline\npresupposes highly idealized versions of public debate and a\n\u201creasoning\u201d public \u2013 a public that has always in\ntruth been fragmented by class, gender, and race-based domination\n\u2013 and neglects the political significance of a multiplicity of\nsubaltern and non-official public spheres and counter-publics (Negt\nand Kluge 1972, Fraser 1990, Warner 2002, Allen 2012). Nevertheless,\nhis critical analysis of a contemporary public of consumers as the\nobjects of processes of de-politicization, commercialization,\npolitical manipulation, and refeudalization seems to have lost nothing\nof its relevance (Seeliger and Sevignani 2022). The claim that a\nrobust and independent public sphere is crucial to a healthy democracy\nis central to Habermas\u2019s later, systematic contribution to\ndemocratic theory in Between Facts and Norms (1992), and he\ncontinues to analyze recent transformations in the structures and\nmodes of communication within the public sphere (Habermas 2006,\n2021).\n\nHabermas\u2019s Knowledge and Human Interests (1968b) was an\nambitious attempt to ground critical social theory as a form of\ninquiry aimed at fostering a distinct type of knowledge tied to a\ndeep-seated human interest in emancipation. This was a return to\nHorkheimer\u2019s methodological aims in \u201cTraditional and\nCritical Theory\u201d (1937), but with a novel set of arguments, such\nas Habermas\u2019s claim that the method of critical theory can be\nilluminated by way of an analogy with psychoanalysis \u2013\n\u201cthe only tangible example of a science incorporating\nmethodological self-reflection\u201d (1968b [1971, 124]). Like\nHorkheimer, Habermas was critical of the positivist understanding of\nscience for failing to see the connection between specific kinds of\ninquiry and fundamental human interests. Habermas posited that both\nthe natural sciences and the \u201chuman sciences\u201d\n(interpretive social sciences and humanities) are grounded in distinct\npractical interests. The natural sciences are a reflective extension\nof \u201clabor\u201d (instrumental action), which is tied to the\npractical interest in material reproduction. The human sciences are a\nreflective extension of \u201cinteraction\u201d (linguistic\ncommunication), which is tied to the practical interest in symbolic\nreproduction. Habermas distinguished \u201ccritique\u201d or\n\u201creflection\u201d as a third practice organized around the\ninterest in emancipation, understood in terms of overcoming various\nforms of heteronomy, domination, and dependency.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Habermas largely abandoned this framework, based\nin an anthropology of knowledge, though he did continue to pursue some\nof its themes, and epistemological questions have remained central to\nhis work in at least two domains: first, in his\n\u201cpostmetaphysical\u201d (non-foundationalist and fallibilistic)\nunderstanding of philosophy as a form of critical reflection at the\nintersection between science and society (Habermas 1983a, Ch. 1) and,\nsecond, in his critique of naturalism, especially neuroscience as a\nform of positivism or scientism that absolutizes the observer\u2019s\nperspective, thereby negating the irreducibility of the\nparticipants\u2019 perspective and occluding the normative structure\nof interpersonal communication (Habermas 2005, Ch. 6).\n\nHabermas increasingly came to the view that critical theory needed\nmore robust social-theoretical and normative foundations, since, in\nhis eyes, the totalizing critique of the first generation had proven\nto be self-undermining (1985, Ch. 5) and his own approach in\nKnowledge and Human Interests had conflated the\nreconstruction of invariant structures of communication (formal\npragmatics) with the critique of the false consciousness of particular\npersons and societies (1973a). Habermas\u2019s alternative path,\nafter abandoning that methodological framework, was to focus on\ncommunicative reason in a two-volume magnum opus titled The Theory\nof Communicative Action (1981). By contrast with an\ninstrumentalist understanding of reason and action, Habermas\u2019s\n\u201ccommunicative turn\u201d starts from a reconstruction of the\nrational and normative potential of everyday interactions.\n\nThis turn involves a multidimensional paradigm shift, illustrating the\ntheoretical ambition of Habermas\u2019 enterprise. He develops a\ntheory of communicative action and rationality that is anchored in\neveryday practices of communication, in which we raise validity claims\nwhose normative dynamic is context-transcendent and which allow for\nconsensus-based coordination of action. He provides a historical\nreconstruction of modern rationalization processes, in which social\nintegration via authority or shared tradition has been increasingly\nreplaced by an expanded use of communicative reason in response to the\npressure to cooperate. Finally, he constructs a two-level model of\nsociety based on the distinction between \u201csystem\u201d and\n\u201clifeworld,\u201d claiming that the regulation of coexistence\nin modern societies depends on both communication oriented towards\nmutual understanding (\u201clifeworld\u201d) and on the anonymous\nsystems of state bureaucracy and the capitalist market\n(\u201csystem\u201d).\n\nFor the methodological renewal of critical theory, Habermas\u2019s\ncentral claim is that within complex societies, social order always\nhas a double form: It must simultaneously be viewed as lifeworld and\nas system. The lifeworld can only be understood from the hermeneutic\nperspective of its participants while the mechanisms of systemic\nintegration only come into view from a system-theoretical or external\nperspective. Critical theory needs both perspectives in order to\nidentify distorting effects of the system on the lifeworld. Habermas\nfamously and controversially diagnoses a \u201ccolonization of the\nlifeworld\u201d by the systemic media of money and power, which\nimpose economic and administrative rationality \u2013 the main forms\nof \u201cfunctionalist reason\u201d \u2013 on areas of the\nlifeworld whose reproduction relies on communicative processes of\ncultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization that\ncannot be subsumed under the media of money and power without\ngenerating resistance. This provides a new foundation for critical\ntheory by updating the critique of reification in the form of a\ncritique of systematic distortions of communication. The\n\u201ccritique of functionalist reason\u201d becomes a central task\nfor critical theory, along with the aim of diagnosing the\n\u201cselective pattern\u201d of capitalist modernization that only\npartially realizes the actually available potential for rationality\nand learning within society.\n\nIn the ensuing discussion, Habermas was accused of reifying the\n\u201csystem\u201d by conceptualizing the capitalist market and the\nbureaucratic state as functionally necessary and supposedly norm-free\nsystems that lie beyond the theoretical reach of critical social\ntheory and the political reach of emancipatory politics (Honneth and\nJoas 1991), of idealizing the lifeworld in ways that largely ignore\nthe domination and exploitation of women and minorities (Fraser 1985),\nof subscribing to a progressivist theory of modernization and history\nthat is Eurocentric and insensitive to the continuing effects of\ncolonial domination (Allen 2016, Ch. 2), and of underestimating how\ndeeply power penetrates into and distorts the very heart of\ncommunicative reason (Allen 2008, Chs. 5\u20136).\n\nHabermas and his followers insist that while these phenomena are real,\nit is only the power of communicative reason \u2013 and the public\ndiscourses and deliberations in which it manifests itself and gets\ninstitutionalized \u2013 that allows us to detect, criticize, and\nultimately overcome (if only partially and temporarily) those forms of\ndomination. Whether one agrees or not that the communicative turn\nenables critical theory to analyze and bring to agents\u2019\nattention the distortions that block them from addressing and\novercoming obstacles to emancipation, one important legacy of\nHabermas\u2019s theory can be seen in opening up space for a\nmethodologically pluralist critical theory in response to the\nfundamental need to capture the perspective of both participants and\nobservers (Bohman 2003). Some Frankfurt School theorists have also\nbuilt on Habermas\u2019s system-lifeworld distinction in maintaining\nthat social change must be viewed from the perspective of both\n\u201cevolution\u201d and \u201crevolution\u201d (Brunkhorst 2002,\n2014).\n1.7 A Continuing and Contested Tradition\n\nOne dominant story told about the Frankfurt School begins with\nHorkheimer\u2019s original research program in the 1930s and views\nHorkheimer and Adorno\u2019s radical departure from that vision in\nDialectic of Enlightenment (1947) as an intellectual dead end\nfrom which Habermas rescued the tradition and returned it to its\noriginal methodology. From this perspective, the second generation,\ndominated by Habermas, superseded the first (see Kompridis 2006,\n255\u2013258, for a critique of this story). An alternative story\nwould point out that Dialectic of Enlightenment was in many\nways consistent with themes first articulated by Adorno in work from\nthe 1930s \u2013 particularly his 1931 inaugural lecture, heavily\ninspired by Benjamin \u2013 that ultimately came to fruition in\nNegative Dialectics (1966a). To complicate matters in another\nway, while collaborating on Dialectic of Enlightenment in the\n1940s Adorno also contributed to the interdisciplinary collaboration\nthat culminated in The Authoritarian Personality (1950), a\nproduct of Horkheimer\u2019s original vision for critical theory that\ncombined social theory with empirical research.\n\nRather than viewing the second generation solely in terms of Habermas\novercoming deficits in the first, this alternative story recognizes\nthat there have always been multiple models and styles of critical\ntheory operating simultaneously within the tradition \u200b\u200band\nthat Adorno was heavily influenced by Benjamin prior to collaborating\nwith Horkheimer (Buck-Morss 1977, Wolin 1994, 166, 265\u2013274).\nMoreover, Adorno\u2019s influence is evident in work by figures in\nthe second generation such as Albrecht Wellmer (1933\u20132018), who\nused Adorno\u2019s work as a basis for challenging Habermas\u2019s\napproach (Wellmer 1985/86, 1993) and was far more sympathetic with\npost-structuralism than Habermas \u2013 also true of Wellmer\u2019s\nstudents in the third generation, Christoph Menke (1988, 2000) and\nMartin Seel. Adorno scholars have defended his work directly against\nHabermas\u2019s criticisms (Cook 2004, O\u2019Connor 2004:\n165\u2013170), and critical theorists continue to defend\nAdorno\u2019s approach to critical theory (Allen 2016, 2021,\n175\u2013183, Marasco 2015, Ch. 3).\n\nTo complicate the story further, Benjamin\u2019s work has had an\nenormous influence on work by a variety of critical theorists, though\nhis wider influence had to wait until Adorno collected\nBenjamin\u2019s essays for a German audience in 1955 and Hannah\nArendt edited them for English readers in 1968. There have been\nsignificant studies of Benjamin\u2019s work by scholars working\nwithin the Frankfurt School tradition (see Buck-Morss 1989 and Pensky\n1993), while many critical theorists beyond the Frankfurt School have\nengaged Benjamin\u2019s critique of linear notions of progress, and\nthe ways in which they fail to break with the catastrophic continuity\nof the present (Benjamin 1940, see L\u00f6wy 2001), as well as his\nanalysis of the constitutive relation between law and violence\n(Benjamin 1920/21; see the recently published critical edition, 2021),\nto mention only Jacques Derrida\u2019s \u201cForce of Law\u201d\n(1990), Giorgio Agamben\u2019s Homo Sacer (1995), and Judith\nButler\u2019s Parting Ways (2012) (see also Loick 2012).\n\nMethodological debates within the Frankfurt School focus not only on\nthe legacy of first-generation theorists but also on Habermas\u2019s\nearlier work, with some arguing that Knowledge and Human\nInterests is worth revisiting because it was more attuned than\nhis subsequent work to the dynamics of power and domination, making it\nmore apt for addressing oppression based on gender (Allen 2008) or\nrace (McCarthy 2004), or for developing a more comprehensive critical\ntheory of domination (Klein 2020). Honneth (2017) has recently taken\nHabermas\u2019s text as a jumping off point for refocusing critical\ntheory on the task of elaborating the relation between emancipatory\ninterests and emancipatory knowledge. Honneth nonetheless maintains\nthat Habermas\u2019s use of the methodology of psychoanalysis as a\nmodel for emancipatory critique is not apt, while others argue that it\nis still in many ways productive (Celikates 2009 [2018,\n137\u2013157]; see Allen 2021, Ch. 5 for a critique of Habermas,\nHonneth, and Celikates).\n\nThe latter debate is part of the resurging interest in psychoanalysis\nby some theorists working in the Frankfurt School tradition.\nHabermas\u2019s own engagement with Freud and psychoanalysis in\nKnowledge and Human Interests was largely methodological in\ncontrast to the substantive use of Freudian ideas by the first\ngeneration (in their analysis of the entanglement of reason and\nrepression and the concrete forces of fascism and antisemitism), and\nHabermas (1983a) subsequently abandoned psychoanalytic theory entirely\nin favor of engagement with developmental psychologists like Jean\nPiaget and Lawrence Kohlberg. In developing his theory of recognition,\nHonneth (1992, Ch. 5) returned to psychoanalysis in the form of object\nrelations theory, primarily in the work of Donald Winnicott, arguing\nthat the experience of fusion and symbiosis that characterizes the\nearly infant-mother relationship is foundational in two ways: It\nserves as the template for the type of recognition Honneth calls\n\u201clove\u201d and explains why individuals and groups continue to\nexperience existing relations of recognition \u2013 that necessarily\nfall short of fusion and symbiosis \u2013 as unsatisfactory and\ncontinue to struggle for recognition. While Honneth\u2019s use of\nWinnicott is controversial (McAfee 2019, Ch. 2; Whitebook 2021,\nDeranty 2021), recent debates have more generally focused on how to\ntake up object relations within critical theory (Allen and\nO\u2019Connor 2019). As a result, the divide now seems to be\nprimarily between those who focus on the pro-social implications of\npsychoanalytic theory (Honneth 2010, Part IV) and those who also\nstress asocial or antisocial forces of Freud\u2019s drive theory in\ngeneral and the death drive in particular in order to avoid what they\nsee as the risk of over-idealization and romanticization built into\nHonneth\u2019s way of integrating psychoanalysis into his theory of\nrecognition (Allen 2021, Ch. 5). Those critics advocate returning to\nthe more negativistic approaches familiar from first-generation\ncritical theorists (Fong 2016, McAfee 2019, Allen 2021).\n\nHonneth\u2019s return to the question of struggles oriented by\nemancipatory interests (2017) hearkens back to a shift that began in\nthe 1980s, when a significant strand of Frankfurt School critical\ntheory, including Honneth\u2019s early work (1985), aimed at\nrecovering the connection between theory and practice by linking the\ndevelopment of theory itself to social conflicts and movements. Oskar\nNegt and Alexander Kluge\u2019s Public Sphere and Experience\n(1972) is an early example of a critique of the bourgeois (i.e.\nhegemonic) public sphere that invokes proletarian or plebeian\nnon-state forms of the public and the divergent critical experiences\nthey articulate as alternative sources of normativity, while also\nidentifying blockages they face in the form of the\n\u201cconsciousness industry\u201d and the pacification of social\nconflicts through \u201cpseudo-publics.\u201d\n\nIn a more explicit vein, Nancy Fraser contributed to the feminist turn\nin Frankfurt School critical theory \u2013 for which the work of\nSeyla Benhabib, Jean Cohen, and Amy Allen has also been decisive\n\u2013 in echoing Marx by arguing that critical theory should frame\nits \u201cresearch program and its conceptual framework with an eye\nto the aims and activities of those oppositional social movements with\nwhich it has a partisan, though not uncritical, identification\u201d\n(Fraser 1985, 97), and that the Frankfurt School in general and\nHabermas in particular had failed to theorize one of the most\nsignificant struggles against domination: the feminist movement (see\n \u00a74.1.1).\n\nHonneth has also sought to systematically reconstruct the link between\ntheory development and struggles by taking experiences of\nmisrecognition that lead to social struggles for recognition as a\npre-theoretical reference point (1992). Drawing on a wide range of\nphilosophical work, psychological and psychoanalytic accounts of\nidentity-formation, and sociological and historical accounts of social\nmovements struggling for recognition, Honneth has developed a theory\nof recognition that is the most prominent alternative paradigm, within\nHabermasian critical theory broadly construed, to Habermas\u2019s\ntheory of communicative action (Honneth 2000, Zurn 2015). Honneth\nmaintains Habermas\u2019s focus on intersubjectivity, but instead of\nlinguistic practice and the ideal of \u201cundistorted\ncommunication,\u201d he focuses on relations of mutual recognition\nand the ideal of \u201cundistorted recognition,\u201d which then\nserve as the basis for the critique of \u201csocial\npathologies\u201d that he considers central to the project of\ncritical theory (Honneth 2004).\n\nIn short, the Frankfurt School of critical theory is today constituted\nby lively debates, discussed more below, about how to deploy various\ncritical methods\n (Section 2)\n and concepts\n (Section 3)\n while remaining attuned to social struggles and crises\n (Section 4)\n and positioning itself in relation to critical theories developed out\nof other traditions.\n2. Critical Methods\n\nFrankfurt School critical theory is best characterized by a set of\nmethodological aspirations that set it apart from many other forms of\nsocial and political theorizing (both in philosophy and the social\nsciences): It aspires to be (1) self-reflexive, accounting\nfor its own embeddedness in specific social and historical conditions,\n(2) interdisciplinary, integrating philosophical analysis\nwith social theory and empirical social research, (3)\nmaterialist, grounding critical theorizing in social reality,\nand (4) emancipatory, orienting itself toward the goal of\nsocial emancipation. These commitments situate the Frankfurt School\nfirmly in the Marxist tradition, and that tradition\u2019s aim of\novercoming the division between theory and practice without\nuncritically subsuming one under the other.\n\nThis has given rise to three interrelated methodological challenges:\nhow to conceptualize (1) the relation of theory to social reality, (2)\nthe role and standpoint of critical theorists, and (3) the normative\nfoundations, content, or force of their critical theorizing. In light\nof historical developments in the first half of the twentieth century\n\u2013 the rise of fascism and Stalinism and the integration of the\nworking class into the liberal welfare state \u2013 Frankfurt School\ntheorists lost confidence in an identifiable direction of history or\nan identifiable collective subject like the proletariat to lead the\nway. It became increasingly unclear how to uphold a link between their\ntheories and a pre-theoretical anchor within social reality \u2013\nsuch as oppositional experiences, forms of consciousness, practices of\nresistance, or social struggles and movements \u2013 or even to see\nhow the conditions for any of those things to emerge were present at\nall.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, this section first sketches the common ground\nmost Frankfurt School theorists find in the approach of immanent\ncritique\n (\u00a72.1)\n before tracing the various ways in which they have sought normative\nfoundations\n (\u00a72.2)\n in a more or less constructive or reconstructive\n (\u00a72.3)\n register, then turns to methods such as disclosive and genealogical\ncritique that are critical of those normative approaches\n (\u00a72.4),\n and concludes by outlining a set of methodological challenges that\nshape contemporary debates\n (\u00a72.5).\n2.1 Immanent Critique\n\nIn responding to the three-pronged methodological challenge of\nrelating theory to social reality, reflecting on the standpoint of\ncritique, and spelling out its normativity, Frankfurt School critical\ntheory moves beyond the usual juxtaposition between internal and\nexternal critique. Frankfurt School theorists rely on a third model of\ncritique, which builds on Hegel and Marx and is often understood as\nimmanent or reconstructive. Critique proceeds immanently or\nreconstructively when it seeks to secure its normative resources and\nepistemic standpoint from the (often implicit) normative structures\nand epistemic possibilities of the practices and\nself\u2010understandings that are constitutive of the (type of)\nsociety in question. Immanent critique avoids the dichotomy between an\ninternal critique that refers to standards and standpoints that are\nalready recognized by those criticized and an external critique that\nrefers to standards and standpoints that are not (or not yet)\nrecognized and therefore have to be derived independently from the\nagents\u2019 perspective and their social context (see Jaeggi 2005,\n2014, Celikates 2009, Stahl 2013a). Critical theory understood in this\nway is both grounded in social reality as it exists and emancipatory\nin seeking to radically transform this reality.\n\nThe critique of ideology can both serve as a paradigmatic example of\nimmanent critique in this sense and illustrate some of the challenges\nthis model faces (Ng 2015). Ideology critique is immanent insofar as\nit starts from the contradictions of a social and ideological\nconstellation and the experience of those affected, which is shaped by\nthese contradictions. It does not criticize an ideological form of\nconsciousness because it is immoral or unethical, but because of its\nepistemic, functional, and genetic features, i.e. for being false or\ndistorted, for contributing to the reproduction of relations of\ndomination, and for arising from within such relations in ways that\nare relatively immune to self-reflection. Consequently, the critique\nof ideology does not focus primarily on the injustice or domination\nfound in society, but on the forms of consciousness, culture,\npractice, habit, and affect that make this injustice or domination\nseem natural or unavoidable (Jaeggi 2008). On this view, any critical\ntheory that aims at emancipation must first aim at diagnosing and\novercoming those obstacles that keep agents from fully experiencing,\ncritically reflecting on, and collectively acting against the unjust\nand dominating conditions under which they live. The question is how\ncritical theorists can do so without falling back into\nepistemologically and politically problematic distinctions between\nfalse and true consciousness, between ideology and scientific insight,\nand between true (\u201cobjective\u201d) and false (\u201cpurely\nsubjective\u201d) interests and needs (Celikates 2006; see\n Section 3.3\n below).\n\nThese challenges are among the many challenges critical theorists face\nin developing an immanent critique that is linked to social reality\nand practice, a link that comes out in two ways. First, theory is\nanchored in social reality in terms of its genesis, as it is shaped by\nthe social context from which it emerges. Second, theory aims at a\npractice that transforms social reality. This dual commitment to\nlinking theory and practice is spelled out in two rather different\nways, both in the history of the Frankfurt School and in contemporary\ndiscussions. One way of anchoring theory in social reality \u2013\ncall it the crisis approach \u2013 starts with social contradictions,\nantagonisms, and crises, along with the practical challenges and\nconflicts that result, and maintains that identifying those conflicts\nrequires socio-theoretical analysis and sociological research (Jaeggi\n2017a, Fraser and Jaeggi 2018). A second way of anchoring theory in\nsocial reality \u2013 call it the struggles approach \u2013 takes\nsocial struggles and movements and the practices of critique and\nresistance of oppressed groups as its starting point. This approach\nincorporates alternative standpoints and counter-hegemonic\nepistemologies into its theorizing with the aim of countering the\npotentially disempowering and anti-emancipatory effects that arise\nwhen critical theorists view crises mainly in terms of structural\ncontradictions while ignoring or underestimating the ways that social\nand political movements themselves can produce and intensify crises\n(Collins 2019, Celikates 2022).\n\nWhile this distinction between crisis and struggle is useful for\nheuristic purposes, it should not be overstated. Most critical\ntheorists share a commitment to the emancipatory role of theory as\nwell as an immanent anchoring of theory in social reality, whether qua\ncrises or struggles. The distinction is a matter of degree and\nstarting points, and it is usually agreed that crises and struggles\nstand in need of mutual articulation (see Benhabib 1986,\n123\u2013133, and\n Section 4.1\n and\n Section 4.2\n below).\n\nHorkheimer maintained that a critical theory should not have an\nexternal relation to, but must enter into a \u201cdynamic\nunity\u201d with, practice, so that it is \u201cnot merely an\nexpression of the concrete historical situation but also a force\nwithin it to stimulate change\u201d (1937a [1972: 215], see also\nMarcuse 1937, Horkheimer 1937b). But under social conditions that\nneutralize social struggles or turn them into regressive backlash\nmovements, the \u201cdynamic unity\u201d envisaged by Horkheimer can\nappear foreclosed. Even for Adorno, whose diagnosis of the\n\u201ctotally administered world\u201d is the most radical example\nof this foreclosure, however, it would be a mistake to conceptualize\nexisting society as a perfectly closed, monolithic, and functionally\nintegrated self-reproducing totality. Rather, even when society is\nviewed as a totality, it has to be understood not in terms of\nhomogeneity or frozen stability but in terms of structural antagonisms\n(Adorno 1957 [1976, 77]), conflict, and process (Adorno 1966b), i.e.\nas riddled with contradictions that, at least in principle, allow for\nforms of oppositional experience, consciousness, or practice that a\ncritical theory can build on. In one of his last texts written shortly\nbefore his death, Adorno concludes that \u201ccritical theory is not\naiming at totality, but criticizes it. This also means, however, that\nit is, in its substance, anti-totalitarian, with the utmost political\ndetermination\u201d (Adorno 1969a; our translation). Even \u2013 or\nespecially \u2013 in the face of the closure of political space, the\npolitical significance of a critical theory can consist in\nsafeguarding the link between theory and the possibility of a\nradically different practice. At the same time, this defense of the\nrelation to practice needs to be complemented by a defense of theory\nin the face of what Adorno identified as an \u201cactionist\u201d\nand anti-theoretical ideology of \u201cpseudo-activity\u201d in\narguing that \u201cpraxis without theory, lagging behind the most\nadvanced state of cognition, cannot but fail, and praxis, in keeping\nwith its own concept, would like to succeed\u201d (Adorno 1969b\n[1998, 265]).\n2.2 Normative Foundations for Critique\n\nDespite this more nuanced reading of Adorno on the relation between\ntheory and practice, the broader diagnosis \u2013 put forth in\ndifferent guises by Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse \u2013 that\nsocial integration, the pacification of class conflict, and the\ninternalization of conformist attitudes had robbed critical theory of\nany pre-theoretical anchor, provides an important background for\nHabermas\u2019s break with the first generation. That break concerns\nnot only their \u201cpessimism,\u201d but the basic methodological\nand substantial premises of their theories. In Habermas\u2019s view,\nthe first generation had navigated themselves into a dead end with\ntheir totalizing diagnosis of an all-encompassing state of delusion\ndominated by instrumental rationality. In response, and in order to\nprovide firm normative foundations for critical theory, Habermas\nadvocates a \u201ccommunicative turn,\u201d reformulating social\ncritique in terms of a critique of the conditions of communication and\ngrounding it in the normative content presupposed within the practice\nof linguistically mediated social interaction and argumentation.\n\nThis element of normative validity \u2013 as opposed to merely\nfactual social validity that is forced, imposed, or presupposed\n\u2013 is elaborated in Habermas\u2019s discourse theory, originally\nreferred to as \u201cdiscourse ethics\u201d (Habermas 1983a, Ch. 4)\nbut later evolving into a differentiated approach that distinguishes\nbetween ethical and moral norms (Habermas 1991) and a discourse theory\nof law and democracy (Habermas 1992). At the heart of discourse theory\nis a principle of discursive justification that Habermas refers to as\nthe \u201cdiscourse principle\u201d or \u201cD,\u201d which\nstates: \u201cjust those norms of action are valid if all persons\naffected could agree as participants in rational discourse\u201d\n(Habermas 1992 [1996, 107]). He further specifies discourse theory\nwith a universalization principle (\u201cU\u201d) that is operative\nwhen arguing about moral norms, and a democratic principle that is\noperative when attempting to justify legal norms within a democratic\nsociety. Habermas does not naively suggest that actually existing\ndiscourses correspond to these ideals, but maintains that in those\ndiscourses participants necessarily make idealizing presuppositions\nthat can then be used to identify and criticize the shortcomings of\nactual discourse as distorted by interests, power relations, and\nideologies.\n\nAs a response to the challenges of immanent critique outlined above,\nHabermas\u2019s work can be understood in terms of a\n\u201cdialectics of immanence and transcendence\u201d (Cooke 2006,\nCh. 3). Habermas maintains the need to situate reason historically and\nwithin social reality \u2013 the largely Hegelian, pragmatist, or\nreconstructive element of his thought. But the idealizations that are\nimmanent in our linguistic practices point toward context-transcending\nvalidity claims that must be defended in a discursive procedure\n\u2013 the Kantian or constructivist element in his thought. Habermas\nnow refers to his attempt to \u201cde-transcendentalize Kant\u201d\nas a form of \u201cKantian pragmatism\u201d (Habermas 1999; see also\nBernstein 2010, Ch. 8; Baynes 2016, Ch. 4; Flynn 2014b).\n\nSome interpretations of Habermas stress that his theory of\ncommunicative action is still a form of immanent critique (Finlayson\n2007, Stahl 2013b) while others object to his increasingly Kantian\nfocus on moral norms (Heath 2014). To provide empirical confirmation\nof his rational reconstruction of the \u201cmoral point of\nview,\u201d further situating it within social reality, Habermas drew\non Kohlberg\u2019s developmental moral psychology, itself decidedly\nKantian in its defining the highest stage of moral development in\nterms of the ability to make universalizable moral judgements\n(Habermas 1983a, Ch. 4; for a critique, see Benhabib 1992, Chs.\n5\u20136, which, drawing on Carol Gilligan\u2019s critique of\nKohlberg, distinguishes a \u201cgeneralized other\u201d from a\n\u201cconcrete other\u201d whose experience cannot be accounted for\nby abstract conceptions of the moral standpoint).\n\nHabermas\u2019s shift toward a Kantian position is particularly\nevident in the Rawls-Habermas debate (Habermas 1995a, Rawls 1995,\nHabermas 1996), widely viewed as a \u201cfamily quarrel\u201d among\ntwo Kantian political philosophers. In his early work on discourse\nethics, Habermas compared his own principle (U) to Rawls\u2019s\n\u201coriginal position,\u201d arguing that his approach was the\nbetter way to \u201coperationalize\u201d the moral point of view as\na form of moral constructivism that tests moral norms in a discursive\nprocedure posited as a dialogical alternative to Kant\u2019s\ncategorical imperative (Habermas 1991). The debate shifted in the\n1990s with their contributions to legal-political constructivism:\nRawls\u2019s Political Liberalism (1993) and\nHabermas\u2019s Between Facts and Norms (1992), in which he\nprovides a rational reconstruction of the institutions of\nconstitutional democracy. In that context, Habermas argues that\nRawls\u2019s approach is not transcendent enough, since in\nHabermas\u2019s view Rawls reduces normative validity to the notion\nof reasonableness immanent within liberal democratic societies (for\nthe implications of their debate for multiple issues in moral and\npolitical philosophy, see Hedrick 2010, Baynes 2016, Chs. 6\u20137,\nand Finlayson 2019).\n\nHabermas\u2019s Kantian turn also came to the fore when extending his\nwork in a cosmopolitan or \u201cpost-national\u201d direction\n(beginning with Habermas 1995b), even if he has continued to combine a\nKantian approach to justifying universal norms with a wide-ranging\nanalysis of the empirical phenomena of globalization (1998). This\ncombination of normative and empirical theorizing, a hallmark of the\nFrankfurt School, is present in a range of work by other critical\ntheorists addressing global issues (Ingram 2019, Ibsen 2023), from the\nchallenge of disaggregating citizenship from the nation-state\n(Benhabib 2004) to transnationalizing the public sphere (Fraser et al.\n2014), and theorizing new forms of transnational democracy (Bohman\n2007). Rather than simply defending abstract cosmopolitan norms, such\napproaches typically aim at some form of critical cosmopolitanism\n(Milstein 2015), with some stressing the crucial role of political\ncontestation of allegedly universal norms \u201cfrom below\u201d (J.\nIngram 2013) or of concrete struggles for rights as part of a broadly\nconstrued intercultural dialogue on human rights (Flynn 2014a).\n\nIn light of Habermas\u2019s turn to Kant, a significant focus of\ndebate among Habermasians and interpreters of Habermas has been the\nstatus of idealizing presuppositions and the ultimate status of the\nprinciples of justification within discourse theory. Defenders of\ndiscourse theory can be divided up into those who focus more on\nimmanence \u2013 pointing in a Hegelian, pragmatist, contextualist,\nor reconstructive direction \u2013 and those who focus more on\ntranscendence \u2013 pointing in a Kantian or constructivist\ndirection. Among the former, some argue, echoing Hegel\u2019s\ncritique of Kant, that Habermas should situate reason more thoroughly\nwithin its social and historical context in order to avoid an overly\nrationalistic, abstract, or gendered approach (Benhabib 1986, 1992),\nwhile others have argued for Habermas to embrace a more pragmatist\n(McCarthy 1991, Bernstein 2010) or contextualist approach (Rorty 1985,\nAllen 2008, Ch. 6). Habermas\u2019s most recent work (2019) attempts\na kind of middle path, going in a decidedly historical direction by\ntracing the provincial, European origins of his\n\u201cpost-metaphysical\u201d mode of theorizing as a preparatory\nstage to a fully inclusive, global intercultural dialogue as the way\nto establish its universal validity in a world characterized by\n\u201cmultiple modernities\u201d (see Forst 2021b, Chambers 2022,\nand Flynn 2022 for critical assessments).\n\nThose who have taken discourse theory in a more Kantian or\ntranscendental direction include Habermas\u2019s long-time\ninterlocutor Karl Otto-Apel, who argued that the dynamic of universal\nvalidity claims in practices of argumentation transcendentally\npresupposes an ideal communication community from which universal\nnormative foundations for the assessment of discourses can be derived\n(Apel 1985). Apel maintained that grounding reason, and thereby\ncritique, requires a more transcendental justification (or\n\u201cultimate grounding\u201d) than Habermas has provided (Apel\n1989; see Habermas\u2019s most recent reply to Apel in 2005, Ch.\n3).\n\nMore recently, Rainer Forst has embraced Kantian constructivism in\npositing that every human being has a \u201cright to\njustification,\u201d a right to demand reciprocal and general reasons\nfor the practices, institutions, and structures that affect them\n(Forst 2007). Forst views moral and political constructivism as\ndistinct, but integrated stages. While the task of moral\nconstructivism is to construct a list of basic moral rights that\ncannot be reasonably rejected, those abstract rights must be given\nconcrete content by citizens in a process of political constructivism.\nHe maintains that his approach is immanent insofar as the right to\njustification is \u201crecursively grounded\u201d by reconstructing\nthe validity claims implicit in all morally justified claims, while\nmaintaining a moment of transcendence since the right to justification\ncan be justifiably claimed in any context. Forst views this as the\nnormative core of a critical theory that understands society as an\nensemble of practices of justification. In that sense, the concept of\njustification is both descriptive (referring to actual arguments given\nwithin a particular social order) and normative (referring to reasons\nthat could or should be accepted), and Forst maintains both\nperspectives are needed for a critique of existing justification\nnarratives and relations of justification (see the Introductions to\nForst 2011 and 2021a).\n\nVarious critics of Habermas have argued that his normative turn and\nshift to Kant risks transforming critical theory into something that\nlooks increasingly like a liberal theory of justice. They posit\nalternative approaches such as reconstructive, disclosive, and\ngenealogical critique that also return to questions and arguments\ndeveloped by the first generation.\n2.3 Reconstructive Critique\n\nThose who subscribe to the model of reconstructive critique\nemphasize the downsides of uncoupling normative argument from social\nanalysis and social theory. In Axel Honneth\u2019s work, this shift\ntakes two forms. In his earlier work (1992), he argues that the\nrelatively narrow rationalist focus on communicative reason occludes\nmore fundamental and often prelinguistic experiences and\nintersubjective relations that give rise to struggles for recognition\nand that his Hegel-inspired theory is better able to articulate, thus\nreestablishing the link between theory and social reality in more\nsubstantial ways. Relatedly, Honneth insists that critical theory can\nbe distinguished from other normative enterprises by its reference to\n\u201cthe pretheoretical resource in which its own critical viewpoint\nis anchored extra-theoretically as an empirical interest or moral\nexperience\u201d (Honneth 1994 [2007, 63\u201364]).\n\nExpanding on this earlier commitment, in his later work Honneth argues\nagainst the division of theoretical labor in which (constructivist)\nphilosophy engages in normative theorizing while empirical sociology\ninvestigates our social reality (2011). By contrast, he undertakes a\n\u201cnormative reconstruction\u201d of how modern society \u2013\nits legal, moral, political as well as social and economic practices\nand institutions \u2013 came to be centered around individual freedom\nas the highest value of this cultural formation. Honneth wants to show\nthat we can only gain an adequate theoretical understanding of, and\ncritical perspective on, modern society if we analyze its different\nsocial spheres as attempts to institutionalize the value of freedom.\nIn contrast to both revolutionary and conservative approaches, he\nwants to show that the structure of this institutionalization allows\nfor a progressive realization of the value of freedom as social actors\nappeal to the constitutive idea of freedom to challenge the concrete\nforms of unfreedom that remain characteristic of our social\nreality.\n\nSimilar to Honneth methodologically, Rahel Jaeggi argues, in her\nreconstructive approach to the critique of forms of life, that\nbracketing the question of how to rationally evaluate and criticize\nforms of life as a whole, as Rawlsians do in the name of liberal\nneutrality and Habermasians in the name of \u201cethical\nabstinence,\u201d ends up hindering precisely the kind of\nexperimental learning processes that are crucial for forms of life to\nremain dynamic and avoid stagnation and failure (2014 [2018,\n9\u201324, 318\u2013319]). But Jaeggi places a greater emphasis on\ncontradictions, crises, and conflicts than the later Honneth (see also\nSchaub 2015).\n\nThe approaches of both Honneth and Jaeggi exemplify a conception of\nimmanent critique that closely links analysis and critique, issuing in\na critique that is neither a mere description of what exists nor a\nnormative demand imposed on what exists from the outside. Accordingly,\nit does not proceed in a free-standing, normative way, but relies on a\nspecific combination of philosophical reflection and\nsocial-theoretical as well as empirical research that is grounded in\nsocial developments and crises and actual social experiences and\nself-understandings. This methodological reorientation has also led to\na more substantial engagement with questions of the economy and the\nsphere of work, both from a more Durkheim-inspired (Honneth 2022,\n2023, Celikates, Honneth, and Jaeggi 2023) and a more Marx-inspired\n(Fraser 2022) position that has also resulted in a fundamental\n(non-reformist) critique of capitalism (Fraser and Jaeggi 2018).\n2.4 Disclosive Critique, Genealogy, and the Critique of Normativity\n\nWhile these approaches seek to develop a socially grounded form of\nnormativity, critics argue that they are still too idealizing in their\nunderstanding of social reality and its historical genesis, as well as\ntoo normative in their methods from the point of view of yet another\nmodel of critique, which has been called disclosive or\ngenealogical.\n\nDisclosive critique typically takes its cue from Adorno (and sometimes\nother theoretical sources from Heidegger to contemporary aesthetics),\nmoving beyond the dichotomy between literary world-disclosure and\nphilosophical reason-giving or the quest for normative foundations. On\nthis view, critique has the task of revealing the world in a new and\ndifferent light, disclosing unrecognized suffering and intricate forms\nof domination that are not only occluded by dominant ideologies but\nalso shape the norms that emanate from that order in ways that escape\nmore strongly normative versions of immanent critique that build on\nthem. Dialectic of Enlightenment can be read as an exercise\nin disclosive critique that seeks to defamiliarize the social world\nfor its readers and thereby break open their unquestioned acceptance\nof how things appear to them (Honneth 1998).\n\nThis negative orientation of disclosive critique can be complemented\nby a more positive one, in which what is disclosed also involves\npotentialities and horizons that have no space or way to articulate\nthemselves within the existing social and normative order. Walter\nBenjamin\u2019s writings on the radical potential of mass culture or\nJudith Butler\u2019s Gender Trouble (1990) can be seen as\nexamples of disclosive critique that involve both the disruption of\nestablished and the experimental opening up of new experiences and\nschemas (Vogelmann 2016).\n\nSome critical theorists attempt to integrate a more positive idea of\ndisclosure into critical theory while maintaining that this is not at\nodds with expanded conceptions or normativity. Some draw on Heidegger\nto develop an account of world-disclosive critique that rethinks\nreason and agency, stressing receptivity and\n\u201cself-decentering\u201d as an alternative model to\nHabermas\u2019s focus on procedural reason (Kompridis 2006). Others\nstress that while disclosure can and must be subject to\nintersubjective validation through argumentation, critical theory must\nhave recourse to the disclosive power of imagination, which is\nrevealed in the force of exemplarity (Ferrara 2008), in focusing\nattention on the aesthetic dimension of narratives that social\nmovements use to imagine alternative possibilities (Lara 1998, 2021),\nor in the way that powerful representations of the good society\nfunction to disclose a transcendent object that cannot be fully known\nor represented but can nonetheless provide ethical orientation (Cooke\n2006). In a variety of different ways, these approaches attempt to\nmaintain the utopian dimension of critique (Marcuse 1937).\n\nGenealogical critique, by contrast, can be seen as a form of\ndisclosive critique that is more focused on problematizing, unmasking,\nand disrupting (Saar 2002, Koopman 2013). Given its association with\nNietzsche and Foucault, it also has a distinct trajectory, set of\nmethodological commitments, and theoretical implications. Taking aim\nat social practices, self-understandings, identities and normative\ncommitments that are seen as natural or accepted as given,\ngenealogical critique traces their historical emergence, highlighting\ntheir contingency and denaturalizing them with the aim of opening up\nthe possibility of thinking and acting differently. From this\nperspective, the search for normative foundations is misguided as it\nboth underestimates how normativity is shaped by unacknowledged\nhistories and power relations and overestimates the transformative\npower of a normative critique that appeals to reason alone.\nGenealogical critique, by contrast, seeks to destabilize and decenter\nthe subject and its fundamental commitments (Owen 2002, Hoy and\nMcCarthy 1994; for a version of this claim that builds on\npsychoanalytic theory, see Allen 2021, Ch. 5).\n\nWhile earlier engagements with genealogical critique, especially\nFoucault\u2019s, were marked by criticisms of his supposed rejection\nof all normative and rational standards, lack of social theorizing,\nand relativism (Habermas 1985, Chs. IX\u2013X, Fraser 1981, Dews\n1987), more recently critical theorists have sought to emphasize the\npotential convergence and mutual illumination of genealogy and\nFrankfurt School critical theory in providing an analysis of the\nworkings of contemporary forms of power and domination (Allen 2008,\nKoopman 2013, Ch. 7, Saar 2018). At the same time, a recent debate\nbetween Forst and Wendy Brown exemplifies how the earlier split\nbetween Habermas and Foucault is rearticulated today, with Forst\ntaking a broadly Habermasian position in arguing that his\n\u201crespect conception of tolerance\u201d manages to safeguard the\nautonomy of individuals by grounding toleration in the right to\njustification, and Brown insisting, with Foucault, on the normalizing,\ndisciplining, and depoliticizing effects of liberal discourses of\ntoleration that ultimately obfuscate the complex operations of social\npower (Brown and Forst 2014, see also Vogelmann 2021).\n\nA genealogical orientation also characterizes postcolonial critiques\nof Frankfurt School critical theory that point out the lack of\nexplicit and sustained engagement with European colonialism and\nimperialism and its legacies, including contemporary forms of racism,\nand the ways in which these have enabled and shaped the processes of\n\u201cmodernization\u201d and thus the formation of\n\u201cmodern\u201d\u2019 societies, subjects, and forms of\nknowledge and rationality, all of which critical theorists purport to\ninvestigate critically (see\n \u00a74.1.3\n below).\n2.5 Current Challenges\n\nExponents of genealogical critique and struggle-centered approaches\nproblematize forms of immanent or reconstructive critique that take\ninstitutional achievements as their starting point, challenging them\nby excavating the histories of domination and repression, as well as\nstruggles, that have constituted these institutions and continue to\nshape their functioning. This gives rise to numerous challenges that\ncontinue to animate methodological debates in critical theory: (1) how\n(or even whether) to defend the putative normative achievements of\nliberal democracies, and if those are to be defended as achievements,\nthen (2) how to theorize about the relation between struggles, crises,\nand institutional achievements, in contexts that may involve either\n(3) an absence of struggles, or (4), the opposite problem, a\nproliferation and fragmentation of struggles:\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of genealogical and post-colonial critique, the\ncommitment to the institutions of the modern liberal nation-state\n(Habermas 1992, Honneth 2011) relies on an idealizing view of the\nhistory and present of this political formation that ignores, or\ntreats as historically contingent and philosophically inconsequential,\nthe forms of domination and exclusion that have accompanied it. At a\ntime when the putative institutional achievements of liberal\ndemocracies \u2013 such as the separation of powers, the independence\nof the judiciary, the integrity of elections, or the protection of\nfundamental rights, especially for minorities \u2013 have come under\nattack from right-wing and neo-authoritarian movements and\ngovernments, the question is how critical theorists can defend the\nnormative achievements of the existing order despite its systemic\nshortcomings. Offering a more radical challenge, some critical race\ntheorists and post-colonial critics argue that those shortcomings\nreveal that what were thought to be normative achievements were\nhistorically premised on, and continue to functionally presuppose,\ndomination and exclusion both at a societal and global level (see\n \u00a74.1.2\n and\n \u00a74.1.3\n below). On a methodological level, this involves the challenge of\nrevising or going beyond the normative and sociological categories of\ncritical theory that seem, at least in part, to be tied to a\nspecifically Western experience. \n\n\nMany critical theorists who accept the claim that these are normative\nachievements insist that a more complex view of the relation between\ninstitutions, struggles, and crises is necessary. As mentioned above,\nan alternative strand within critical theory that reaches from Negt\nand Kluge\u2019s recovery of proletarian counterpublics through\nFraser\u2019s theorization of feminist movements to current attempts\nto reconnect critical theory with the struggles of our age, has\ninsisted that abstracting from collective movements and struggles and\nrelocating the emancipatory potential in the normative achievements of\nthe existing institutional order risks underestimating how\ninstitutional dynamics, the inherent crisis tendencies of (more or\nless) liberal democracies, and social struggles are inextricably\nintertwined. Beyond a merely historical and social-theoretical point,\nhow this question is answered will also affect how to conceptualize\nthe role of emancipatory as opposed to regressive struggles in the\nface of the new authoritarianism (see\n \u00a74.2.3\n below). \n\n\nMore abstractly, critical theorists must account for situations in\nwhich there seem to be no struggles or forms of critical consciousness\nto latch onto, or only highly constrained forms of them. How can a\ncritical theory respond to a situation in which domination is more or\nless total and has managed to suppress any critical consciousness and\npractice? Some of Marcuse\u2019s descriptions of contemporary society\ncome closest to this scenario. One might respond that \u201ca society\nof happy slaves, genuinely content with their chains,\u201d a society\nin which domination is experienced not as domination but as freedom,\nmight be the critical theorists\u2019 nightmare, but it \u201cis a\nnightmare, not a realistic view of a state of society which is at\npresent possible\u201d (Geuss 1981, 83\u201384). Nevertheless, the\nchallenge points to a dilemma critical theorists need to navigate. On\nthe one hand, a critical theory requires a starting point in the forms\nof consciousness, experience, and practice of its addressees, but, on\nthe other hand, critical theory should respond to and address\ndistortions and blockages of precisely these forms of consciousness,\nexperience, and practice. While these distortions and blockages will\nin most cases turn out to be partial rather than total and thus allow\nfor some form of problematization to emerge (Celikates 2009, Part\nIII), it seems equally important to not simply tie a critical theory\nto already existing social movements and thus to \u201cgoals that\nhave already been publicly articulated\u201d since this\n\u201cneglects the everyday, still unthematized, but no less pressing\nembryonic form of social misery and moral injustice\u201d (Honneth\n2003, 114; see also Renault 2004, 2008). \n\n\nThe opposite problem can arise when critical theorists diagnose a\nproliferation of social struggles and lines of conflict beyond the\nclassic antagonism of labor and capital. After the demise of the kind\nof philosophy of history that identified the proletariat as the\nrevolutionary subject and the workers\u2019 movement as the\nemancipatory force to which critical theory could and should attach\nitself, it has become unclear how critical theorists can determine\nwith which of the different emancipatory movements of their day to\nenter into the kind of alliance envisaged by Marx and Horkheimer and\nwhich \u201cforms of existing social critique\u201d or\n\u201cexperiences of injustice\u201d to pick up on. This difficulty\nis not only due to the plurality \u2013 or intersectionality \u2013\nof movements, practices of critique, and experiences of injustice, but\nalso due to the fact that struggles are often far from perfectly\naligned and can operate at cross-purposes, with regard to both their\naims and their methods. In answering this challenge, critical\ntheorists can neither simply deduce the \u201ccorrect\u201d struggle\nfrom some overarching laws of historical development (the pole of\ndeterminism), nor claim that theorists simply have to decide which\nstruggle or movement to link their theory to (the pole of\nvoluntarism). \n\n\nInsofar as critical theory is committed to immanent critique, focusing\non the internal contradictions and crises of a specific social order\nand the struggles and movements that arise from within it, these\nchallenges cannot be easily resolved. Rather than seeking to resolve\nthem at an abstract level, they could instead be viewed as opening up\na field of tensions that critical theorists need to navigate within\nthe specific constellation they find themselves in. While critical\ntheory needs to be anchored in actually existing forms of theoretical\nas well as practical critique, in the social struggles that people\nactually engage in, it also has the task of articulating the\nexperiences of those who are blocked from engaging in struggles of\ntheir own and of contributing to the further theoretical articulation\nof existing struggles. At times, critical theory may need \u201cto\npush beyond the \u2018subjective\u2019 elements of struggle and\nlanguages of claims-making to the more \u2018objective\u2019\ndimensions of contradictions and crises, which turn more on the\ndynamics of systemic elements operating independently of whether or\nnot people actually thematize them via struggle\u201d (Fraser and\nJaeggi 2018, 11), without losing sight of the epistemic and political\nrisks this involves.\n\nIn addressing these risks, one way forward has been to embrace\nmethodological pluralism and to understand critical theory less as a\ncomprehensive social theory and more as a critical practice, as\nsomething critics do (Bohman 2003, Kompridis 2006, Celikates 2019a).\nThis approach can more systematically incorporate alternative\nstandpoints and epistemologies and the practices of epistemic\nresistance they are tied to, and more easily build on other traditions\nand paradigms of critical theory, such as feminist, anti-colonial, and\nanti-racist struggles and theorizing (Mills 1988, Collins 1990, 2019,\nMedina 2013, Loick 2021, Celikates 2022; see\n Section 4.1\n below). Anchoring the perspective of critical theory within the\nsocial struggles and epistemic standpoints of the oppressed can serve\nas a counterweight \u2013 in the sense of \u201creflexive\naccountability\u201d (Collins 2019) \u2013 to the tendency of\nactually existing critical theories to set in motion a disempowering\nspiral of epistemic asymmetries that denies the existence of\ntheoretically sophisticated practices of critique and resistance on\nthe ground and thereby reproduces existing obstacles to equal\nparticipation in knowledge production and to radical social\ntransformation. On this view, critical theorizing is itself a social\npractice that recognizes its addressees as equal partners in a\ndialogical struggle for appropriate interpretations and realization of\ntransformative potentials that is informed by social theory and\nsociological research. As such, it can make use of a variety of\ncritical methods \u2013 reconstructive, constructive, disclosive, or\ngenealogical (Freyenhagen 2018) \u2013 that are not easily subsumed\nunder one unified metatheoretical framework, even if they can be seen\nas various attempts to spell out the idea of a critical theory as\nself-reflexive, interdisciplinary, materialist, and emancipatory.\n3. Critical Concepts\n\nThe basic concepts of Frankfurt School critical theory \u2013 such as\nalienation, reification, ideology, but also emancipation \u2013 are\nexpressive of the specific methodology, or set of methodologies, that\ncritical theorists in this tradition employ. As explained in the\nprevious section, critical theory in this tradition proceeds in an\nimmanent way, and this implies that its concepts are both developed\nfrom within a certain social constellation and seek to go beyond the\nself-understanding characteristic of this constellation, they are both\ndescriptive and evaluative, and they exemplify the unity of analysis\nand critique inherited from Marx. While some concepts are primarily\n\u201canticipatory-utopian\u201d (like emancipation) and others\nprimarily \u201cexplanatory-diagnostic\u201d (like alienation,\nreification, and ideology, as obstacles to emancipation) (Benhabib\n1986), they are all \u201cthick concepts\u201d whose descriptive\ncontent is irreducibly social-theoretically as well as evaluatively\nloaded.\n\nIn addition, some of the critical concepts developed by Frankfurt\nSchool authors \u2013 again alienation, reification and ideology are\nthe clearest examples \u2013 point to second-order phenomena. In\ncontrast to substantial first-order injustices, these concepts seek to\ncritically diagnose what happens when unjust (or exploitative or\noppressive) social relations are not experienced as unjust (or\nexploitative or oppressive) but are accepted as legitimate or natural,\nor if they are intuitively experienced but not explicitly recognized\nas such, or recognized but not adequately interpreted and articulated.\nThese concepts pick out social phenomena that are often ignored by\nmore mainstream approaches in moral and political philosophy that\nfocus on the moral status of the individual and their actions, or the\nlegitimacy of institutional arrangements, to the neglect of the domain\nof the social, with its distinct structure, dynamics, and challenges\n(see, e.g., Honneth 2000, Ch. 1, Zurn 2011, Neuhouser 2022, Ch. 1).\nThe following subsections introduce four key concepts that exemplify\nboth the critical methodologies discussed in the previous section and\nthe substantial social-theoretical and diagnostic contributions to our\nunderstanding of contemporary society that Frankfurt School critical\ntheory aspires to. There are of course other concepts used by critical\ntheorists \u2013 from normativity, justice, and autonomy to power,\ndomination, and oppression \u2013 but the focus here is on concepts\nless widely discussed in other traditions or to which Frankfurt School\ntheorists have made distinctive contributions.\n3.1 Alienation\n\nThe concept of alienation has a long history within critical theory.\nThe basic concept refers to the idea of humans being separated,\nestranged, or distanced from something crucial to their freedom or\ncapacity to flourish. One is alienated when one has a distorted or\ndeficient relation to oneself or to the natural or social world.\nCritical theorists face a number of challenges in developing a\ncritique of alienation. Classic critiques of alienation, Rousseau and\nthe early Marx for example, relied on substantive conceptions of human\nnature or self-realization to ground their diagnoses and provide\nstandards for critique. Thick accounts of human nature are less\ncompelling today, which means contemporary critics of alienation have\npursued alternative approaches. Since a critique of alienation\nattempts to diagnose a social pathology, not a problem with particular\nindividuals, critical theorists must also provide a social theory that\ncan convincingly diagnose the social causes of, and possible paths for\novercoming, alienation.\n\nRousseau can be credited with inaugurating \u201csocial\nphilosophy\u201d as a domain of inquiry while developing a critique\nof alienation (Honneth 2000, Ch. 1). Although he does not refer to\nalienation in his \u201cSecond Discourse\u201d (1755), the term\ncaptures his argument that living in society leaves human beings\ndisconnected from their true desires and passions, which he explored\nby speculating about what humans would have been like in a state of\nnature. Within Hegelian and Marxist social criticism, the concept of\nalienation has been used to capture the idea that something produced\nby humans is wrongly taken by them as something given or outside their\nconscious control (Jaeggi 2005 [2014, 13\u201314]). In his\nPhenomenology of Spirit (1807), Hegel first develops a\nconcept of alienation to describe the relation of the human mind to\nreality when the products of human reason are not recognized as our\nown creation but are instead experienced as alien forces. In his\nEconomic and Philosophical Manuscripts (1844), Marx analyzed\nhow wage labor within capitalist societies causes alienation. Workers\nproduce a world of objects, but the products of their labor as well as\ntheir own productive activity are commodities over which they have no\ncontrol; the world they create becomes an alien power with increasing\ncontrol over them. They are alienated from the kind of spontaneous and\ncreative productive activity that Marx, in his early work, posits as\nthe essence of human nature.\n\nThe concept of alienation was influential among first-generation\nFrankfurt School theorists, particularly in the work of Marcuse and\nthe later work of Erich Fromm (1961). In Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno echo Rousseau in telling a\nstory of alienation going back to the dawn of civilization. They\nmaintain that human beings, in their quest to dominate the natural\nworld (external nature) and to acquire mastery over themselves (inner\nnature), become estranged from both aspects of nature, failing to see\nwhat Enlightenment denies: that we are fundamentally natural beings\n(Vogel 1996, 69).\n\nContemporary critical theorists have attempted to rejuvenate the\nconcept of alienation without relying on overly substantive accounts\nof human nature and without the totalizing diagnosis of Dialectic\nof Enlightenment. Rahel Jaeggi formalizes key elements of the\nHegelian-Marxist approach in developing a philosophical account of\nalienation focused on how failure to adequately appropriate oneself or\nthe world results in a \u201crelation of relationlessnes\u201d\n(2005). In this way, the non-alienated self is not defined by a\nsubstantive conception of human nature but by the quality of\none\u2019s relation to the world: whether this relation is sustained\nby successful processes of appropriation. Hartmut Rosa also defines\nalienation as a distorted relation to the world but with a more\nsubstantive approach to the quality of non-alienated relations to the\nworld. For this, he has developed a multifaceted concept of\n\u201cresonance\u201d to capture a kind of vibrant or responsive\nrelation to the world by contrast with the alienated experience of the\nworld as ossified, mute, or hostile (2016). In contrast to these\napproaches, which are largely framed in terms of necessary conditions\nfor living a good life, Rainer Forst has argued that deontological\naspects of the critique of alienation have been neglected, and that\nthere is a kind of \u201cnoumenal alienation\u201d that results from\nnot being recognized, or failing to recognize oneself, as an agent of\njustification (2017).\n3.2 Reification\n\nReification is a concept with close ties to alienation. If alienation\nis viewed as diagnosing a distorted relation to the world, reification\ncan be understood as one way of articulating the form that distortion\ncan take. In the broadest sense, reification is a term used to\ncritique cases in which some entity that should not be viewed as an\nobject \u2013 oneself, other people, or some segment of the social or\nnatural world \u2013 is treated as a thing-like object. It is\ninstrumentalized, objectified, or quantified in a way that is\ninappropriate according to some critical standard. One challenge for\ncritical theorists is articulating the standard or perspective \u2013\na non-reified relation or perspective \u2013 according to which the\nreified stance is not appropriate.\n\nGeorg Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s classic 1923 essay on reification heavily\ninfluenced the Frankfurt School. Luk\u00e1cs combined Marx\u2019s\nanalysis of the \u201cfetishism of commodities\u201d \u2013 which\ncauses social relations between human beings to appear as quantifiable\nand thing-like \u2013 with Weber\u2019s analysis of bureaucracy\n\u2013 which extends this instrumentalizing attitude to all social\ndomains. Reification becomes \u201cthe necessary, immediate reality\nof every person living in capitalist society\u201d (1923 [1971,\n197]), which can refer to an instrumentalizing attitude taken toward\nobjects (whose qualitative feature are reduced to quantitative terms),\nother people, and features of one\u2019s own personality when viewed\nsolely from the perspective of their marketability.\n\nDifferent critical theorists have appealed to the concept of\nreification to capture similar but not identical phenomena, with\ndiffering definitions corresponding to differences in the larger\ntheoretical framework in which they deploy the concept. For Horkheimer\nand Adorno, the concept captures the dominance of instrumental reason\nand the totally administered world that results (1947). Habermas\nreinterpreted the concept to describe the ways in which systems such\nas the economy and the bureaucratic state, which function properly as\nspheres in which instrumental rationality dominates, extend too far\ninto spheres of everyday life that he refers to as the lifeword\n(1981). This \u201ccolonization\u201d of the lifeworld by the system\nresults in the communicative structures of the lifeworld becoming\nreified. Honneth, by contrast, takes up the concept of reification in\nrelation to his theory of recognition, arguing that reification\ninvolves a kind of forgetting of a primary relation of mutual\nrecognition that he calls \u201cempathetic engagement\u201d (2005).\nWithin Rosa\u2019s theory of resonance, in which he attempts to\ncapture one side of the history of modernity as a \u201ccatastrophe\nof resonance,\u201d reification can be viewed as a\n\u201cforgetfulness of resonance\u201d (2016 [2019, 325]). The\nrevival of this concept has been extended in other ways by using\nreification as a guiding concept for analyzing the relation between\neconomics and subject formation within a \u201cpolitical economy of\nthe senses\u201d (Chari 2015) or pairing reification with a suitably\nmodified notion of reconciliation to assess experiences of exclusion\nand integration within modern social orders (Hedrick 2019).\n3.3 Ideology\n\nIdeology is similar to alienation and reification in being both a\nconcept critical theory inherits from the Marxist tradition and one\nthat is used to identify a distorted relationship to the world and\none\u2019s own place in it (Eagleton 1991). In the Marxist tradition,\nit has played a prominent role in answering questions such as why\npeople accept social and political conditions that seem to be contrary\nto their own interests, or how it is possible that subjects feel free\nalthough they are dominated. When people experience and describe\nrelations of exploitation and domination as natural and without\nalternative or even as just, this seems to be an effect of ideology.\nIdeology, on this critical understanding, usually denotes a more or\nless coherent system of action-guiding beliefs, such as liberal\nindividualism, that is said to obscure social reality \u2013\nespecially power relations, crisis tendencies, and social conflicts.\nAs Marx (1844, 1846, 1867) and subsequent critical theorists argue, by\nobscuring these, ideology contributes to the reproduction of the\nprevailing order (Rosen 1996). Accordingly, any radically\ntransformative and emancipatory practice presupposes that this\nideological obfuscation must be recognized as such, criticized, and\novercome. The challenge to such critical reflection is particularly\nacute when the possibility of even asking questions about how we might\nwant to live, if we could transform society, is occluded by a\ntechnocratic ideology that reframes such practical questions as\ntechnical problems with narrow solutions (Habermas 1963, 1968a).\n\nIdeology differs from mere deception, propaganda, or conspiracy\ntheories. Because it is structurally anchored in social reality and\nplays a functional role for its reproduction, it cannot be explained\nwith reference to the individual psyche or manipulation by others\nalone. Even if false consciousness is an element of ideology, critical\ntheorists from Adorno to Jaeggi emphasize the practical nature of\nideology as it shapes identities, is embedded in social practice, and\nfunctions via affects and habitus.\n\nAccording to one influential interpretation, the critical notion of\nideology developed in the Frankfurt School is characterized by three\ndimensions (Geuss 1981, Jaeggi 2008). In the first, epistemic\ndimension, ideologies always encompass epistemically deficient beliefs\nand attitudes that can range from substantially false beliefs to the\nconfusion of particular and universal interests and inadequate\nconcepts (such as \u201cillegal alien\u201d to refer to undocumented\nimmigrants). In the second, functional dimension, ideologies are seen\nas playing a necessary, or at least supporting, role for the\nstabilization and legitimation of social relations of domination, i.e.\nfor their more or less smooth reproduction. In the third, genetic\ndimension, ideologies are shaped, in ways that are not transparent to\nthe agents themselves, by the social conditions under which they\nemerge, so that it is not an accident that people end up with the\nspecific sets of beliefs they end up with in a specific type of\nsociety.\n\nRadicalizing the Marxist notion of ideology as \u201cnecessarily\nfalse consciousness,\u201d i.e. consciousness that is false (and not\nsimply morally problematic) for structural reasons (and not just\naccidentally), Adorno and Marcuse often seem to argue that ideology\nreaches into the innermost core of subjects, who are shaped all the\nway down to their psychological and physical impulses, leading them to\naffirm the existing order and thereby preempting any resistance to\ndomination. While this might help explain the resilience of ideology\nand its continued effectiveness, it also poses the challenge for\ncritical theorists to find an anchor for their critique in the forms\nof consciousness, experience, and practice of its addressees\n(Celikates 2006, and\n Section 2.5\n above).\n\nDue to its emancipatory orientation, the critique of ideology must\nconnect up with the self-understanding of those affected by trying to\ninitiate learning processes, which in turn are supposed to lead to a\ntransformation of those social conditions that are hidden behind\nideologies. At the same time, without recourse to critical theories\nagents themselves will often continue to face obstacles to\nidentifying, diagnosing, and explaining the effects of ideology on\ntheir critical capacities and practices. Arguably, showing that a\ncontradiction is inscribed in the existing social order and can only\nbe \u201cdissolved\u201d if this order itself is fundamentally\ntransformed is also a task for a critical theory.\n\nAlthough for most critical theorists ideology is not merely false\nconsciousness but embedded in social practices and identities,\nideology critique has been criticized for being overly cognitivist and\nunderestimating the role of habitualized attitudes and cultural\npractices, for relying on an overly strong distinction between true\nand distorted consciousness, and for presupposing an idealized notion\nof the subject. Critics such as Foucault and Bourdieu speak instead of\npower-knowledge (Foucault 1973, 15) or of symbolic power and its\nembodiment (Bourdieu 1980, Ch. 8). The epistemological and political\nchallenges the notion of ideology gives rise to continue to animate\ndiscussions (Celikates, Haslanger, and Stanley (eds.) forthcoming),\nincluding, more recently, on the relation between ideology and\nepistemic injustice (Fricker 2007, Mills 2017), cultural techn\u0113\n(Haslanger 2017a), and propaganda (Stanley 2015).\n3.4 Emancipation\n\nFrankfurt School critical theory inherits its emancipatory orientation\nfrom Marx, in the sense that it aims not only to understand, but also\nto contribute to a radical transformation of the social world that is\nalready under way, and the commitment to real emancipation as\nrequiring a radical, irreducibly social and political transformation\nthat overcomes the fundamental contradictions of modern society\ninstead of partial or local reforms aimed at surface-level symptoms.\nEmancipation is thus understood as liberation, including\nself-liberation, from domination by social, political, and economic\npowers, both personal and structural. Against this background,\nhowever, critical theorists have given different accounts of what\nemancipation is, what it requires, and how much can be said about it\nas a process and as an aim or state. While some (Horkheimer 1937a,\nHabermas 1968b) have thought of emancipation as a process of\nenlightenment and self-reflection that would allow for the realization\nof a rational organization of society, others thought of emancipation\nas sensual liberation (Marcuse 1969), or as emancipation from the\n(internalized) destructive imperatives of capitalism towards a state\n\u201cof lying on water and looking peacefully at the sky\u201d\n(Adorno 1951c [2005, 157]).\n\nAt the same time, and insofar as the working class has been\nintegrated, fragmented, or at least reconstituted, it has become\nincreasingly less clear who is to be emancipated (or self-emancipated)\nfrom which forms of domination and how. The challenges to the\npossibility of emancipation include reflections on the potentially\noverblown ideals of autonomy, sovereignty, and transparency that seem\nto underlie it (Laclau 1992), the limits of active self-transformation\nunder conditions in which subjects have been shaped by power-ridden\nforms of subjectivation (Allen 2015), and the prospects of overcoming\ncapitalism given the apparent lack of any clear and viable\nalternative. Today, critical theorists also face the challenge of\nreorienting the emancipatory project in the face of a catastrophic\nclimate crisis that seems to privilege adaptation, mitigation, and\nsheer survival over utopian visions of emancipation that have also\nserved historically as a pretext for an extractive and dominating\nrelation to nature (Brown 2022).\n\nIn light of these challenges, a critical theory that wishes to hold on\nto its emancipatory orientation will need to articulate emancipation\nas an immanent possibility that is enabled and in some ways required\nby unprecedented historical developments. Whether in doing so it can\nbuild on the presumption of an emancipatory interest of the oppressed\nthat theorists from Marx and Horkheimer to Habermas and Honneth (2017)\nhave sought to identify remains contested. But thinking of\nemancipation as a second-order process that aims at enabling\ncollective practices of self-determination over and against the\nobstacles picked out by concepts such as alienation, reification, and\nideology, rather than as a substantial ideal or positive utopian\nvision of emancipation to be attained, might provide a starting point.\nInsofar as critical theory continues to see the existing social order\nas one of structurally entrenched domination, exploitation, and\nalienation, it will also continue to rely on some notion of an\nemancipatory process that points beyond those structures, even if this\nprocess is invariably plural, non-teleological, open-ended, and\nnegative in orientation.\n4. Critical Theories Today\n\nMarx defined critical theory as the \u201cself-clarification of the\nstruggles and wishes of the age\u201d (Marx 1843). The vitality of\nthis approach to critical theory depends on continually taking up this\ntask in new social contexts, as the first generation of the Frankfurt\nSchool did. Contemporary critical theorists continue this legacy by\nengaging with and theorizing in relation to contemporary struggles,\ncrises, and practices. This has meant engaging a much wider range of\nemancipatory social movements than earlier generations of the\nFrankfurt School, who focused more on class struggle and capitalism\n(and the ways these were entangled with antisemitism and fascism)\nwhile largely neglecting issues like colonialism, racism, and the\nsubordination of women. Contemporary critical theorists have expanded\nand enriched the Frankfurt School tradition by engaging with, and in\nsome cases making contributions to, feminist theory, critical race\ntheory, and postcolonial and decolonial theory (4.1), enlarging their\nanalyses of crises beyond capitalism and its contradictions (4.2), and\nexploring a variety of critical practices ranging from civil\ndisobedience to prefigurative, abolitionist, and revolutionary\npractices (4.3).\n4.1 Theorizing Struggles and Movements\n\nAs emphasized above, Frankfurt School critical theory is\nmethodologically interdisciplinary and defined by its aim of\ncontributing to the emancipatory transformation of society by\ncritically reflecting on the ways in which thinking itself can be\ndistorted by structures of domination. This is also true of the\nvarious forms of critical theorizing that have emerged from and in\nrelation to struggles against gendered oppression, racism, and\ncolonialism and its legacies. Indeed, those critical theories bring to\nlight structures of domination and modes of thinking (patriarchy,\nwhite supremacy, neocolonialism and Eurocentrism) that have until\nrecently been neglected by the Frankfurt School and must be taken into\naccount by any theory that aims to be critical and emancipatory.\n4.1.1 Gender\n\nMore than one feminist theorist has argued that engaging feminism has\nbeen, and still is, crucial to renewing Frankfurt School critical\ntheory both methodologically and in order to live up to its\nemancipatory aims (Fraser 1985, Ferrarese 2018). But analyzing the\nintersection between feminist theory and the Frankfurt School is\ncomplicated by the diverse array of theorists on both sides of that\nintersection. Some of the debates among feminist critical theorists\nmirror debates already discussed, for instance between those who draw\non first generation versus Habermas or those who embrace Habermasian\nversus poststructuralist critical theory.\n\nIn most accounts, the first generation of the Frankfurt School is\nportrayed as not including any women and, with the exception of\nMarcuse in the 1970s (Marcuse 1974), its main protagonists largely\nfailed to theorize about gender-based oppression or engage with\nfeminist movements or the feminist theory of their time (there is,\nhowever, a new research project at the Institute for Social Research\nin Frankfurt that aims to challenge the dominant historiography by\nhighlighting contributions of female researchers such as K\u00e4the\nWeil and Else Frenkel-Brunswik and feminist work within the Frankfurt\nSchool). While fully acknowledging why feminists might find little of\nvalue in the first generation, some feminist theorists have\nhighlighted important methodological affinities between, and potential\nfor productive engagement with, that body of work (Brown 2006, Heberle\n2006, Marasco 2006). In spite of the first generation\u2019s\nnostalgia for the authority of the patriarchal family, their studies\nof authoritarianism were groundbreaking in analyzing the family as a\npolitical institution and breeding ground for fascism (Marasco 2018).\nRecent interest in Adorno\u2019s work in particular builds on his\ntheory of the nonidentical as support for the feminist critique of\nessentialist identities as well as affinities between feminist aims\nand his deconstruction of dualisms like nature and history or reason\nand desire, and his appeal to lived experience as crucial to\nphilosophy and critique (Heberle 2006, 5\u20136). Attempts at\nsynthesis include using his theory of the nonidentical, in dialogue\nwith Lacan and Marx, to theorize a new approach to feminist political\nsubjectivity (Leeb 2017), and combining Adorno\u2019s insights into\n\u201cbourgeois coldness\u201d with the feminist ethics of care to\nrethink the fragility of our concern for others within a capitalist\nform of life that fosters \u201cgeneralized indifference\u201d while\nalso producing a gendered form of attention to others (Ferrarese\n2018).\n\nTurning to the second generation, the critique of Habermas\u2019s\nfailure to adequately theorize gender in his Theory of\nCommunicative Action (1981) was a turning point. In a now-classic\nessay, Nancy Fraser (1985) took a cue from the Marx quote about\ncritical theory reflecting on the struggles of the age to criticize\nthe Frankfurt School, and Habermas in particular, for failing to\ntheorize one of the most significant struggles against domination.\nSeyla Benhabib raised similar concerns about whether the theory of\ncommunicative action could adequately theorize the feminist movement\n(1986, 252), and in Situating the Self (1992) aimed to make\nHabermasian discourse theory more cognizant of the self as gendered\n(see also the essays collected in Meehan 1995). In his later discourse\ntheory of democracy, Habermas does engage the feminist theory and\npolitics of equality to illuminate his core thesis about how private\nand public autonomy mutually presuppose each other (1992 [1996,\n418\u2013427]). But feminist critical theorists maintain that his\nrationalist approach fails to adequately capture the way power\noperates (Allen 2008, Ch. 5; McNay 2022, Ch. 1) or to incorporate\nforms of communication like narrative that have been crucial to\nfeminism (Lara 1998, 2021; Young 2000).\n\nThe third generation of the Frankfurt School represents a crucial\nshift, with prominent feminist theorists like Fraser and Benhabib\nattempting to make critical theory more amenable to feminism from\nwithin the tradition, while also engaging in debates with leading\nfigures in the poststructuralist strand of feminist critical theory\nlike Judith Butler (Benhabib et. al. 1995). A core issue in these\ndebates has been between Habermasian feminists who stress autonomy and\npoststructuralists who stress the idea of subjection \u2013 the ways\nin which power is central to the formation of subjects and their\ndesires (Butler 1997). Amy Allen critically engages and synthesizes\ninsights from both sides of this debate in viewing subjects as both\nconstituted through relations of power and able to exercise autonomy\nin the form of critical reflection (Allen 2008). Axel Honneth, another\nkey figure in the third generation, has engaged with feminist theory\n(Honneth 2000) and the feminist movement (2011 [2014, 154\u2013176]),\nand in debates with feminist critical theorists including Fraser\n(Fraser and Honneth 2003) and Butler (Ik\u00e4heimo et al. 2021), but\nhis work has also been the subject of sustained feminist critique of\nhis conception of love, the family, and caring labor (Young 2007,\nR\u00f6ssler 2007, Wimbauer 2023).\n\nFraser has, over several decades, developed a systematic defense of\nsocialist feminism while charting various shifts in the feminist\nmovement (see the essays collected in Fraser 2013), recently making\nthe case that the contemporary crisis in care work must be understood\nas part of a larger general crisis in capitalist society (Fraser 2016,\n2022, Ch. 3). Other feminist critical theorists also argue for a\nreturn to the critique of capitalism as crucial to feminist theorizing\n(Leeb 2017). From a different perspective, Lois McNay argues that\nrecent Frankfurt School theorists, not only Honneth and Forst but also\nFraser and Jaeggi, have failed to adequately incorporate the\nexperience of gendered oppression into critical theory (McNay 2022).\nAnother set of challenges arises from the need to develop an\nintersectional analysis of power and domination while engaging with a\nbroader range of work in feminist and gender theory including queer\nand trans* theory as well as transnational and postcolonial feminism\n(Allen 2019, 537\u2013538).\n4.1.2 Race\n\nApart from the influential studies on antisemitism and fascism by the\nfirst generation, Frankfurt School theorists have until recently shown\nlittle interest in issues of race and racism despite the prominence of\nanti-racist struggles and theorizing throughout the twentieth century\nand the present. The silence is of course not total. Early analyses\npoint to prejudice toward Jews and other minority groups as an\nimportant part of the authoritarian personality and a key mechanism of\nproviding \u201cpseudo-orientation in an estranged world\u201d\n(Adorno et al. 1950, 622), diagnose a culturalist transformation of\nthe earlier biological racism at the center of fascism in post-war\nEurope that serves to maintain white supremacy (Adorno 1955,\n148\u20139), and identify the phantasmatic dimension of racism and\nits fictions of homogeneity, purity, and essential difference (Adorno\n1967a). Arguably, there are also broader methodological lessons from\nthe relational and materialist theory of antisemitism developed by\nAdorno and Horkheimer that also hold for the study of racism (even if\ntheir relation remains contested, see Catlin 2023), namely the\nrejection of psychologizing and individualizing approaches, the\ninsistence that the pathology always lies in the antisemitic or racist\nsubjects and not in their victims, and the emphasis on structural\nfactors that include the functional role of racism in the context of\nthe crisis of capitalism and democracy (see Postone 1980 for an early\nattempt to explain modern antisemitism in relation to the nature of\ncapitalism and the anti-capitalism of National Socialism).\n\nDespite these openings, there has not been any sustained engagement\nwith the phenomena of race and racism or with anti-racist struggles\nand theorizing, an eminently emancipatory form of knowledge production\nthat, from W.E.B. Du Bois and Frantz Fanon to Black feminism (Collins\n1990, 2019, Mills 2017), has been engaged in crossing the\ntheory-practice divide and articulating dominated standpoints in ways\nthat should have been of significant interest to Frankfurt School\ntheorists (Outlaw 2005; for a relatively early exception see McCarthy\n2009).\n\nThis missed opportunity is all the more astonishing as the\nintersection of class and race, of racism and capitalism has been at\nthe center of theorists that share a Marxist orientation, and even\nsome closeness to the Frankfurt School, most notably Angela Davis\n\u2013 who had studied with Marcuse in the US and with Adorno in\nFrankfurt, and, following Marcuse, insists on the need to bridge the\ngap between theory and practice and to combine the critique of racism\nas well as gender-based domination with a critique of capitalism\n(Davis 1983, 2004) \u2013 and Stuart Hall, who, building on Marxist\nand post-Marxist approaches, theorizes racism as a historically\nvariable response to crisis and as a mechanism that allows capital to\ndivide the working class (Hall 2021).\n\nIn contrast to the first generation\u2019s focus on the \u201cdark\nside\u201d of modernity, later theorists, from Habermas to Honneth,\ndeveloped a stronger commitment not only to Enlightenment values, but\nto the belief that these have been, more or less successfully,\ninstitutionalized in Western societies. As a result, their views clash\nwith a core aim of Critical Race Theory (Crenshaw et al. 1995) \u2013\nitself influenced by Marxist theories of the state and the law \u2013\nnamely, the aim of debunking the idea that the law and the state are\nneutral institutions that secure the common good and the rights of all\nas an ideology masking their character as instruments of racial (and\nclass) oppression, as evidenced by massive and persistent inequalities\nthat systematically disadvantage Blacks in the US in particular and\nracialized populations on a global scale, in various areas of life,\nfrom access to education, health, jobs, and housing to the risk of\nbecoming a victim of police violence. According to this view, the\nforms of freedom and solidarity realized in liberal-democratic\nsocieties are not just contingently accompanied by exclusions of\nracialized groups, as if these values had only been insufficiently\nrealized up to now and only need to be extended to those hitherto\nexcluded. Rather, the thesis is that these exclusions have played a\nconstitutive role in the history of these societies and their value\nsystems and continue to shape them to this day, and that radical\nemancipation would therefore require developing entirely different\nvisions of living together in freedom and solidarity (Kelley\n2002).\n\nMore recently, Nancy Fraser (2022, Ch. 2) has picked up on Black\nMarxist discussions of racial capitalism (prominently Du Bois 1935) by\narguing that capitalism provides a structural basis for racial\noppression and thus exhibits an inherent (even if historically\nvariable) tendency to racialize populations in order to more\neffectively expropriate and exploit them. Others have elaborated a\nrelational and materialist understanding of racism that builds on how\nantisemitism was theorized in the early Frankfurt School, and how\nracism was rearticulated in a culturalist register in reaction to\nanticolonial and antiracist struggles (Balibar and Wallerstein 1991,\nBojad\u017eijev 2020). What these approaches share, and what might be\na distinctive contribution of a critical theory of race and racism, is\na commitment to understanding racism as a comprehensive social\nrelation that needs to be understood in relation to broader\n(capitalist) social formations, \u201crace\u201d as an ideological\neffect rather than an unquestioned category for social analysis, and\nanti-racist struggles as a starting point for critical theorizing\nabout race \u2013 commitments that are at least partially shared with\nimportant contributions in the critical philosophy of race (Mills\n2003, Shelby 2003, Haslanger 2017b).\n4.1.3 Colonialism and Post-colonialism\n\nFor all its focus on modes of domination in modern society, Frankfurt\nSchool critical theory has largely failed to address European\ncolonialism and imperialism (Said 1993, 278) and their continuing\neffects in a world structured by massive inequalities and asymmetries\nbetween the Global North and the Global South. With a few recent\nexceptions to be discussed here, critical theorists in this tradition\nhave not engaged much with the large body of postcolonial and\ndecolonial theory, even if in recent years debates about the universal\nvalidity of human rights and cosmopolitanism, globalization and\nmultiple modernities, religious pluralism and postsecularism, have\nprovided ample occasion to go beyond still operative Eurocentric\nlimitations and become more globally relevant (Mendieta 2007, Butler\net al. 2011, Baum 2015, Ingram 2019, Kerner 2018; on some early\nFrankfurt School engagement with Chinese thought, specifically in\nBenjamin\u2019s work, see Ng 2023).\n\nThe main target of postcolonial critique is the idea of a universal\nhistory in which the central engine of progress is located in modern\nEurope while non-Europeans are viewed as always lagging behind. The\nstory has taken many forms, from narratives of progress in\nEnlightenment thinkers and their critics, such as Hegel (Buck-Morss\n2009), to nineteenth-century theories of racial hierarchy and\ntwentieth-century theories of development that have been shaped by,\nand in turn, rationalized, racism, slavery, and imperialism (McCarthy\n2009, Bhambra and Holmwood 2021). Both anticolonial struggles and\ntheorizing (in the work of Mahatma Gandhi, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire,\nFanon and others) have insisted that the history and present of\ncapitalism and of modern European and North American societies are\nconstitutively entangled with colonialism, imperialism, and their\nafterlives, and that taking their trajectory as paradigmatically\nmodern ends up representing a specific and heterogeneous trajectory\nand experience as universal and self-contained (Gr\u00fcner 2010).\nWhile some aspects of postcolonial critique can be seen as overlapping\nwith the critique of conceptions of the subject, reason, and universal\nhistory in the early Frankfurt School, the former also goes beyond the\nlatter by understanding these as the effects of specifically colonial\nforms of domination and by tracing a different genealogy of fascism\nthrough its roots in the colonialism of the nineteenth century\n(Bardawil 2018).\n\nRecent decades have seen attempts to bring postcolonial theory into\ndialogue with the Frankfurt School. From the side of decolonial\ntheory, Enrique Dussel has been one of the most prominent decolonial\nphilosophers to engage with Frankfurt School philosophers, developing\na global ethics of liberation in critical dialogue with the discourse\nethics of Apel and Habermas (Dussel 1998; see also Dusell 2011 and\nAllen and Mendieta 2021).\n\nFrom the side of Frankfurt School critical theory, postcolonial\ncritique has been taken up in a variety of ways (see also\nV\u00e1zquez-Arroyo 2018). In the same spirit of Horkheimer and\nAdorno\u2019s attempt to critique enlightenment in the name of an\nalternative conception of enlightenment, both Susan Buck-Morss (2009)\nand Thomas McCarthy (2009) attempt to salvage something of the core\nidea that is the target of their critique: \u201cuniversal\nhistory\u201d for Buck-Morss, and \u201cdevelopment\u201d for\nMcCarthy.\n\nAmy Allen (2016), on the other hand, is more decidedly critical of the\nrole of the discourse of \u201cprogress\u201d and the role of such\nconcepts in grounding normativity and shaping assumptions about\nhistorical development, modernization, and reason in the work of\nHabermas, Honneth, and Forst. She regards the latter approaches as\ndeeply Eurocentric and contrasts them with a contextualist form of\ncritique, inspired by Foucault and Adorno, that takes the form of a\ncritical history of the present that uncovers the deep entanglement\nbetween reason and domination. Calling for an even more thorough\nrevision of historical narratives, conceptual frameworks, and\nnormative criteria, Gurminder Bhambra (2021) argues that the prevalent\nunderstanding of modernity as an endogenous European achievement\nobscures the fact that colonization and slavery were integral to and\nconstitutive of the Enlightenment project of modernity in both its\nepistemic and institutional dimensions, a task for which historical\nand theoretical resources beyond Adorno and Foucault would be\nrequired. Fundamental questions about modernity, the human subject,\nand freedom also emerge from an encounter between critical theory in\nthe Frankfurt School tradition and Caribbean thought (Sealey and Davis\nforthcoming). In a similar vein, contemporary critics of the\npersistence of colonial structures point to how a denial of the\ncolonial past reaffirms a violent global color line (Mbembe 2016) that\naffects how societies treat Indigenous peoples (Coulthard 2014) and\nracialized and migrant populations (Celikates 2022).\n4.2 Diagnosing Crises\n\nDiagnosing crises, and the social contradictions that give rise to\nthem, is a hallmark of Hegelian-Marxist critical theory. Marx famously\ndiagnosed capitalism as a crisis-ridden social system, and the early\nwork of the first generation of the Frankfurt School was a response to\nthe economic, social, and political crises of their time.\nDialectic of Enlightenment (Horkheimer and Adorno 1947) can\nbe understood as addressing the crisis of reason that was experienced\nwith the rise of National Socialism, but the critique of instrumental\nreason was disconnected from more concrete crises and struggles.\nHabermas aimed to restore the link between critique and crisis\nbeginning with his 1973 book Legitimation Crisis (Benhabib\n1986, 252\u20133, Cordero 2017, Ch. 3). Writing in the context of\nstate-managed capitalism, Habermas diagnosed the distinctively\npolitical contradictions and potential for political crises\nwithin a social system that aims to steer the economy and manage\neconomic crises (a point influentially elaborated by Offe 1984).\n\nIn subsequent decades, crisis critique, along with the critique of\ncapitalism, was largely abandoned by Frankfurt School theorists (for a\nnotable exception see Postone 1993). Renewed theoretical interest has\ncoincided with rising public concern about social, political, and\neconomic systems currently in, or always seemingly on the brink of,\ncrisis, all against the backdrop of the unfolding effects of the\nongoing climate catastrophe.\n4.2.1 Economic Crises\n\nNancy Fraser was one of the first critical theorists to revive crisis\ncritique and to do so as part of a comprehensive critique of\ncapitalism that renews the link between analytical diagnosis and\ncritique (Fraser 2011, 2014; see Wellmer 2014 for a critique of the\nFrankfurt School\u2019s earlier neglect). What distinguishes\nFraser\u2019s approach is that it posits capitalism as the unifying\ncausal link among seemingly distinct crises \u2013 in relation to\ncare work, the environment, and political institutions \u2013 by\nviewing capitalism as an institutionalized social order in which the\neconomic system \u201ccannibalizes\u201d the very conditions that\nmake it possible within the spheres of social reproduction, the\nnatural environment, and the political system (Fraser 2022). Fraser\ncombines analysis of \u201cobjective\u201d social conditions \u2013\ncontradictions and crises \u2013 with an orientation toward social\nmovements by analyzing the \u201cboundary struggles\u201d that arise\nat the seams between the economic system and other domains, making the\ncase for these struggles to unite around an anti-capitalist\nagenda.\n\nIn a similar way, Rahel Jaeggi has developed a crisis-oriented theory\nof immanent critique (2014, Ch. 6) that is not limited to diagnosing\nsystemic dysfunction but includes the normative expectations and\nself-understandings of social agents (Jaeggi 2017a; see Fraser and\nJaeggi 2018), but at a more abstract theoretical level than\nFraser\u2019s immanent analysis of capitalism as a social order. Like\nFraser and Jaeggi, Albena Azmanova argues for renewed attention to the\ncritique of capitalism but is skeptical about how helpful\n\u201ccrisis\u201d talk is (2014) and maintains that radical social\nchange is possible without crisis, revolution, or utopia through a\nunited struggle against forms of precarity that are endemic to\ncontemporary capitalism (2020). More generally, the turn to economic\ncrisis dynamics has also led to a renewed interest in work \u2013 its\ngeneral significance, pathologies, and emancipatory potential (Jaeggi\n2017b, Dejours et al. 2018, Honneth 2023).\n4.2.2 Ecological Crises\n\nTurning specifically to the ecological crisis, Frankfurt School\ntheorists have only recently begun taking seriously the task of\nrethinking their approach to critical theory in the current context of\nan ongoing ecological disaster on a global scale (for an early\nexception, see Vogel 1996). Some critical theorists argue that this\nsituation calls for a new paradigm of \u201cCritical\nNaturalism\u201d (Gregoratto et al., 2022); others argue for a\nfundamental rethinking of Western conceptions of human freedom and a\nradical shift in conceptions of the ethically good life as a\nprecondition for the kind of radical social change required by the\ncurrent crisis (Cooke 2020, 2023). Fraser focuses on the role of\ncapitalism in the climate catastrophe and the need for eco-politics to\nbe anti-capitalist so that we can reassert control over, and begin to\nreinvent from the ground up, our relation to nature (Fraser 2021,\n2022; see Bernstein 2022 for a recent approach to such\nrethinking).\n\nIn rethinking our conception of nature, given the lack of serious\nattention to theorizing about nature in the second and, until quite\nrecently, third generation of the Frankfurt School, it is not\nsurprising that many critical theorists have looked more to the first\ngeneration (see the collected essays in Biro 2011), with\nAdorno\u2019s work viewed as a promising starting point for\nrethinking humans\u2019 relation to nature (Cook 2011,\nCasseg\u00e5rd 2021, Ch. 3). Cook argues that the \u201cproject of\nshowing that human history is always also natural history and that\nnon-human nature is entwined with history\u2026 informs all\nAdorno\u2019s work\u201d and that there are important affinities\nbetween his work and proponents of radical ecology (Cook 2011, 1,\n5\u20136). On the other hand, the view of nature as having a kind of\notherness that is beyond and not fully graspable by humans \u2013 a\nview expressed at times by Adorno and Horkeimer as well as Marcuse\n\u2013 has been criticized in favor of a more Hegelian-Marxist\napproach that sees \u201cnature\u201d as a product of human activity\n(Vogel 1996, 2011). Others argue for reviving critical engagement with\nMarcuse\u2019s work as a resource for addressing the ecological\ncrisis, with its combination of a critique of science and technology\n(most radically, as a call for a \u201cnew science\u201d) with the\nidea that social transformation must include a changed, aesthetic\nrelation to nature (Feenberg 2023a, 2023b). At this point, it is clear\nthat there must be more engagement between Frankfurt School theorists\nand the many \u201ccritical ecologies\u201d being developed today,\ne.g., deep ecology, eco-feminism, eco-socialism, ecological Marxism,\nenvironmental justice, indigenous and decolonial ecologies, and new\nmaterialism (on the recent dialogue between Frankfurt School theorists\nand new materialism, see Rosa et al., 2021).\n4.2.3 Political Crises\n\nFinally, Frankfurt School theorists have turned their attention to\npolitical crises and the rise of right-wing populist, authoritarian,\nand neo-fascist movements, parties, and governments (Brown, Gordon,\nand Pensky 2018, Gordon 2017, Abromeit 2016). This crisis is\nparticularly important because adequately addressing the economic and\necological crises of our time requires political solutions, which will\nbe hindered by political systems that are themselves in crisis,\nthereby contributing to a regressive dynamic (Jaeggi 2022, Forst\n2023).\n\nFrom the perspective of critical theorists, there seem to be two\naspects of the political crisis that are often missing from mainstream\nliberal accounts. The first pertains to the genesis and the causes of\nthe crisis (Brown 2019, Gambetti 2020). Against accounts that see\nauthoritarianism only in terms of a rupture with and as entirely\nforeign to liberal democracy, they argue that we need to examine the\ncontinuities and enabling conditions that allow authoritarian\ntendencies to arise from within liberal-democratic capitalist\nsocieties. Without analyzing the neoliberal restructuring of social\nrelations and the ways in which populist and authoritarian movements\nexploit electoral strategies, fragmented public spheres, and liberal\nideological frameworks such as \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d the\ncritique of and resistance to them will necessarily remain\ntruncated.\n\nThe second aspect pertains to the dynamic of authoritarianism and the\npolitical crisis it engenders. Beyond focusing on its political\ndimension (e.g. political aims and values), critical theorists have\nsought to analyze the socio-cultural, affective, and psycho-social\ndynamics of authoritarianism and its attractiveness to populations\nthat seem to have little to gain from the election of populist leaders\n(Marasco 2018, Brown 2019, McAfee 2019, Redecker 2020, Zaretsky 2022).\nThese approaches can draw on and are supported by Adorno\u2019s\nanalysis (1967a) of core features of authoritarian right-wing\npopulism. First, it is not so much actual abandonment but a feared,\nanticipated, or imagined abandonment, along with a perceived loss of\nprivileges that had come to seem natural, that are the driving force\nof the rise of a reactionary authoritarianism that then gets\nmisdescribed as a revolt of the oppressed and exploited. Second, the\nproponents of authoritarianism, following an antisemitic and/or racist\nlogic, personalize the blame for their fears and feelings of\nabandonment by projecting it onto groups they classify as alien,\nrather than attributing it to structural features of society.\n\nIn responding to all the crises discussed here \u2013 economic,\necological, and political \u2013 critical theorists must grapple with\na number of challenges. Purely at the level of theory, there is the\nquestion of whether positing unity or convergence among crises is\ndiagnostically accurate. At a practical level, it remains to be seen\nwhether a unity thesis will be politically motivating and whether a\nconvergence of social struggles is indeed on the horizon. The issue of\npractice also bears on the question of whether and to what extent the\nobjective conditions of crisis and contradiction diagnosed by critical\ntheorists actually affect people\u2019s everyday lived experience and\nbecome motivating factors for political movements (see\n Section 2.5).\n Such questions about the relation between theory and practice have\nlong been a focus of critical theorists and have recently gained\nattention in theorizing about a range of critical and political\npractices.\n4.3 Critical Practices\n\nWhile overcoming the gap between theory and practice has been a\ncentral methodological and political concern for critical theorists,\ncritics have pointed out the prominent turn away from practice to\ntheory in the first generation \u2013 accused by Luk\u00e1cs of\ntaking up residence in the \u201cGrand Hotel Abyss\u201d\n(Luk\u00e1cs 1963, 22) \u2013 and the continued marginalization of\ncritical praxis in later generations (Harcourt 2020). There are\nmultiple grounds for challenging this assessment. Frankfurt School\ntheorists had arguments all along about how to assess and relate to\nradical movements, such as the student movement of 1968 (Adorno and\nMarcuse 1969, Freyenhagen 2014, Pickford 2023), and there has always\nbeen a strand that continuously engaged with struggles and movements,\nfrom Marcuse to Negt and Kluge and Fraser. Some critical theorists\nhave focused on deliberative democracy, the public sphere, and civil\nsociety (Habermas 1962, 1992, 2021, Cohen and Arato 1992, Benhabib\n2004, Lafont 2019) as core fora for critical practice, while others\nhave argued for critical theory itself to be democratized and\nunderstood as a critical practice (Bohman 2003, Celikates 2009).\n\nStill, many of these approaches have been criticized for prioritizing\ninstitutional achievements over struggles and critical practices, and\nreform over revolution. Given the challenges outlined above (4.2), it\nis not surprising that some recent work tries to reverse this tendency\nby exploring more radical responses to such crises. These attempts\nnotably push beyond the dichotomy between reform and revolution\n\u2013 for example, by promoting non-reformist reforms that could\n\u201calter the terrain on which future struggles will be waged, thus\nexpanding the set of feasible options for future reforms\u201d\n(Fraser, in Fraser and Honneth 2003, 79) \u2013 and mine the rich\nhistory and present of radical struggles outside traditional forms of\npolitical organizing such as the party or reimagine the party in\nradical ways (Dean 2016).\n\nThe range of critical practices engaged with by critical theorists\npast and present is extensive (for an inventory, see Harcourt 2020,\nCh. 15). Frankfurt School theorists of earlier generations covered\nvarious forms of resistance, from the \u201cGreat Refusal\u201d of\nthe 1960s (Marcuse) and the potential for resistance in independent\nthinking and critical analysis in the face of universal reification\n(Adorno) to civil disobedience as a sign of a dynamic public sphere\nand civil society (Habermas 1983b, Cohen and Arato 1992, Ch. 11). More\nrecently, critical theorists within various traditions have analyzed\nforms of disobedience (direct, digital, migrant etc.) as political\npractices of contestation and struggles for democratization\n\u201cfrom below\u201d (Young 2001, Smith 2013, Scheuerman 2018,\nCelikates 2019b). Other practices of resistance that do not directly\nengage with state institutions or appeal to the broader public include\nforms of sabotage (Malm 2020), fleeing, withdrawal, or defection.\nThese turn away from what are seen as state-oriented struggles for\nvisibility, recognition, or representation (Virno 2004, Roberts 2015)\nand towards subaltern forms of sociality (Moten and Harney 2013) and\ncounter-communities that prefigure fundamental alternatives for living\ntogether (Loick 2021). Emphasizing the revolutionary dimension of\ncritical practices, theorists have drawn on the abolitionist tradition\nof struggles against slavery and colonialism, and its revitalization\nin movements like Black Lives Matter, to call for a fundamental\ncritique of racial capitalism and its entanglement with the punitive\nstate, and a correspondingly radical transformation of all social\nrelations and institutions (Davis 2005, Gilmore 2022). Critical\ntheorists have also explored political practices of assembling (Butler\n2015), occupying, striking, and reorganizing processes of social\nreproduction (Gago 2019), linking these to the need to rethink\nrevolution beyond the model of a single break or event and more as an\ninterstitial process (Redecker 2018, Saar 2020).\n\nWhether the new revolutionary subjects and struggles that emerge in\nthese critical practices will indeed converge to fundamentally\nchallenge the existing order, open up new pathways to emancipation,\nand develop emancipated \u2013 more just, democratic, and sustainable\n\u2013 modes of living together remains to be seen.\nHorkheimer\u2019s quip still holds: \u201cif the proof of the\npudding is in the eating, the eating here is still in the\nfuture\u201d (1937a [1972, 220\u20131]). Against this background,\ntheoretical explorations of critical practices \u2013 in the\nmultiplicity of their forms, terrains, and actors \u2013 can be seen\nas part of the ongoing attempt to bring theory and practice together\nwith an emancipatory orientation in light of the crises and struggles\nof the age. This approach has characterized the Frankfurt School from\nits very beginnings and has been a driving force in its continual\n(self-)transformation, making it into one of the most influential\nparadigms in social philosophy today.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abromeit, John, 2016, \u201cCritical Theory and the Persistence\nof Right-Wing Populism\u201d, <em>Logos: A Journal of Modern Society\nand Culture</em>, 15(2)\n [<a href=\"https://logosjournal.com/2016/abromeit/\" target=\"other\">Abromeit 2016 available online</a>].", "Adorno, Theodor W., 1931 [year this lecture was given], \u201cDie\nAktualit\u00e4t der Philosophie\u201d, in Theodor W.
