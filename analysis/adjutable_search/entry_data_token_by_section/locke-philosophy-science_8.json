Margaret Wilson has defended such an interpretation,\nthough in the 1979 paper that launched the debate, her intent is to\nshow how acutely Locke understood the explanatory limitations of\n\u201cBoylean mechanism\u201d. Specifically, Wilson argues, the\ninconsistency reveals Locke\u2019s recognition \u201cthat some\npresumed properties of matter cannot be conceived as\n\u2018natural\u2019 consequences of Boylean primary qualities\u201d\n(Wilson 1979, p. 197). Thus, our ignorance about bodies has more\nprofound causes than our ignorance about the primary qualities of a\nbody\u2019s constituent corpuscles. In accordance with her view that\nLocke\u2019s agnostic tendencies (just like his dogmatic ones) are\ngenuine, Wilson interprets Locke\u2019s concept of superaddition\nrobustly, as a sort of divine action that goes beyond the corpuscular\nhypothesis. According to this \u201cnon-essentialist\u201d or\n\u201cdivine annexation\u201d reading, Locke understands superadded\nproperties as properties that God has annexed to matter by fiat, and\nthat bear no intrinsic connection to matter\u2019s real essence. This\nreading implies a distinction in etiology for superadded qualities.\nWhereas the other qualities of matter are either given initially, as\nthose qualities constituting the real essence, or else flow from the\nreal essence, superadded qualities are added on independently of the\nreal essence, such that the substance would have been complete without\nthem. This view implies that while superadded properties are\nconsistently present, they are inexplicable by physical theory and,\naccordingly, are evidence of divine action.\n [24]\n\nSome other interpretations absolve Locke of inconsistency, either by\nemphasizing his so-called dogmatic side while downplaying or\nreinterpreting his agnostic tendencies, or emphasizing his agnosticism\nwhile downplaying his dogmatism. One line of interpretation, then,\nreads Locke as in some manner accepting the corpuscular hypothesis\n(Mandelbaum 1964, chapter 1; Osler 1970, p. 12; Ayers 1975; McCann\n1994, \u00a71 and p. 85; McCann 2002, pp. 354\u2013355). According to\nweaker versions of this reading, Locke\u2019s project is the\nnaturalistic one of pursuing the philosophical implications of the\nbest available scientific theory, and developing an epistemological\nbasis for it. McCann, for example, reads Locke as defending the\natomist version of the corpuscular philosophy over its Cartesian\ncompetitor by providing an epistemology for it. While Descartes had\nprovided an epistemology for his plenist version, there was nothing\ncomparable for the atomist version associated with Gassendi and Boyle\nuntil Locke supplied it (McCann 2002, pp. 354\u2013355). According to\nAyers\u2019 stronger interpretation, Locke accepts \u201cpure\nmechanism,\u201d that is, the orthodox version of the corpuscular\nhypothesis, which includes the contact action proviso. According to\nthis view, all of matter\u2019s qualities flow from its real essence\n(Ayers 1981).\n\nSince this line of interpretation seeks to downplay Locke\u2019s\nagnostic tendencies, one challenge is to account for Locke\u2019s\npessimism about the possibility of our knowing real essences.\nMandelbaum meets the challenge by confining Locke\u2019s pessimism to\nthe real essences of particular material substances; we are able to\nknow \u201cthe general properties possessed by all material\nsubstances,\u201d and are ignorant only of the \u201cparticular\nsizes, shapes, number, or motions of the particles which go to make up\nany specific object\u201d (Mandelbaum 1964, p. 54). A related\nchallenge is to account for Locke\u2019s appeals to superaddition,\nsince prima facie, Locke\u2019s reason for invoking God is\nthat he thinks the corpuscular hypothesis has no resources for\nexplaining the four problematic phenomena. Ayers responds by rejecting\nWilson\u2019s divine annexation interpretation of superaddition in\nfavor of a deflationary one. According to Ayers\u2019 \u201cdivine\narchitect\u201d interpretation, Locke makes no distinction in\netiology by calling a property superadded; he means only that God\nselected the property with particular care when first creating matter.\nTo diffuse the effect of Locke\u2019s remarks to Stillingfleet, in\nwhich Locke appears to embrace action at a distance, Ayers points to\nLocke\u2019s late manuscript, \u201cThe Elements of Natural\nPhilosophy,\u201d interpreting certain passages as referring\ngravitational effects to an undetectable medium (Ayers 1981, pp.\n212\u2013214). This move has been challenged by Stuart. Claiming that\nthe manuscript was probably written for the education of a child,\nStuart denies that it could trump Locke\u2019s remarks to\nStillingfleet (see Stuart 1998, pp. 378\u2013379).\n\nAnother way to absolve Locke of inconsistency is to emphasize his\nagnosticism or skepticism, while downplaying or reinterpreting\npassages that appear to commit him to the corpuscular hypothesis.\nInterpretations in this vein tend to emphasize Locke\u2019s pessimism\nabout our ability to know real essences, to discern necessary\nconnections, and consequently, have scientia in natural\nphilosophy. Commentators pursuing this line include Downing (1998,\n2007), Jolley (2002), and Connolly (2015); the latter argues for an\neven greater epistemic humility, one extending to real essences, along\nwith superaddition (mentioned briefly below).\n\nThe central challenge facing such interpretations is to account for\nthe passages in which Locke speaks as though he accepts the\ncorpuscular hypothesis, most notably those in which he appears to\nidentify the real essences of material substances with the\ncorpuscles\u2019 primary qualities. Jolley (2002) accounts for\nLocke\u2019s so-called dogmatic tendency in strategic terms.\nLocke\u2019s Essay targets both Aristotelians and\nCartesians, and though agnosticism, which targets the Cartesians, is\nultimately the dominant tendency in his thought, Locke emphasizes the\nexplanatory power of the corpuscular hypothesis whenever he has the\nAristotelians in his sights. Downing (1998, 2007), meanwhile,\ninterprets Locke\u2019s Essay as developing metaphysical\ndistinctions that constrain physical theory, and then downplays his\ndogmatic side by taking the corpuscular hypothesis to be truly only a\nhypothesis for him, and denying that real essence can be identified\nwith primary qualities. Properly understood, Downing argues, the\ndistinction between real and nominal essence is a metaphysical\ndistinction. It is thus more fundamental than the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities, which belongs to a particular\nphysical theory, the corpuscular hypothesis. To be worth its salt, a\nphysical theory must meet the metaphysical constraint provided by the\nreal-nominal essence distinction. That is, the physical theory must\nprovide some way of making sense of the notion that material bodies\nhave an internal constitution that is inaccessible to us while\nproducing qualities that are accessible. Locke explains his\nmetaphysical distinction using one physical theory, the corpuscular\nhypothesis, as an illustration, and he often appears to accept or even\ndefend that hypothesis. Still, this is only an appearance, an\nappearance due to a certain advantage that the corpuscular hypothesis\nhas over other physical hypotheses: it is the theory best suited to\nour sensory capacities and understanding. Despite its unique status,\nLocke sees it as a mere hypothesis, one crippled by the explanatory\nlimitations evidenced by the problematic phenomena discussed earlier.\nFor Downing, then, Locke\u2019s dogmatic tendencies disappear,\nleaving only his agnostic side.\n\nTaking a different approach to the situation, Jacovides (2017) treats\nLocke\u2019s descriptions of what we perceive, intuit, and are\ncapable of conceiving as providing a case for testing some Kuhnian\ntheses; as the normal science of his day, the corpuscularian\nhypothesis sets limits upon what Locke can conceive.\n",
