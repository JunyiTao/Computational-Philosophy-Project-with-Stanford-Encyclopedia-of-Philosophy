Particular Psychopathologies\n\nWhile often more ambitious and encompassing, philosophical attempts to\ndefine or characterize mental disorder have also provided\nfiner-grained analyses.(See chapters in Fulford, Davies et al., 2013;\nMoseley & Gala 2016; and Tekin & Bluhm 2019.) Beyond research\ninto the symptom clusters classified as the schizophrenias, that are\nwidely regarded as candidates for some kind of natural kinds status,\nanalyses have been offered for anorexia and other eating\ndisorders (Gadsby 2017a, 2017b, 2020;Bordo 1993; Giordano 2005,\n2019; Svenaeus 2013; Morris 2013; Tan, Hope & Stewart 2003, Tan,\nStewart, Fitzpatrick & Hope 2010; Radden 2021); addiction\n(West 2006; Poland & Graham 2011; Flanagan 2017; Vohs &\nHeatherton 2000; Holton & Berridge 2013; Foddy & Savalescu\n2010; Summers 2015; Lewis 2015; Levy, 2006, 2011, 2013; Kennett 2013;\nSripada 2018; Westin 2020; Glacken, Roberts & Krueger 2021;\nPickard 2016); anti-social personality disorder\n(Sinnott-Armstrong 2008; Adshead 2013; Roskies 2003; Schramme 2014;\nLevy 2007;Kennett & Fine 2008; Maibom 2014; Justman 2021);\ndepressive and manic-depressive conditions (Varga 2016; Bluhm\n2011; Bluhm, Jacobson & Maibom 2012; Horwitz & Wakefield 2007;\nWakefield 2012; Bolton 2013; Hoffman & Hansen 2017; Ratcliffe\n& Stephan 2014; Browne 2018; Radden 2013; Radoilska 2012; Biegler\n2011; Fuchs 2001, 2005, 2013); scrupulosity, Obsessive-Compulsive\nand other volitional disorders (Glas, 2013; Szalai 2016; Summer\n& Sinnott-Armstrong 2019); anxiety (Horwitz &\nWakefield 2012); autism spectrum conditions (Adams 2013;\nBaron-Cohen, Lombardo & Tager-Flusberg 2013); disorders of\ndissociation (Worrell & Denham 2016; Maiese 2016); Defiant\nDisorder (Potter 2014); Borderline Personality Disorder (Potter 2009)\nand Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (Gagn\u00e9-Julien\n2021).\n\nThe category of psychosis, employed for extreme states of disorder\naffecting perceptual capabilities (in hallucinations) and reasoning\n(in delusions and other cognitive defects) have received considerable\nphilosophical attention. With almost unfailing consequences for their\nsubject in clinical, legal, social, and personal settings, the\nseverity of hallucinations and delusions serves to distinguish them\nfrom many of the general controversies about disorder noted thus far.\nThe incidence of and pathology associated with hallucinations has been\nquestioned, as has their origins, and phenomenology (Leudar &\nThomas 2000; Ratcliffe 2017; Henriksen, Raballo, & Parnas 2015).\nAnd delusions have attracted the particular attention of philosophers\nfor their incomprehensibility, and challenge to theories about\nmeaning, language, belief, and intention (Coltheart & Davies 2000;\nFletcher & Frith 2009; Bortolotti 2009, 2020; Miyazono 2019; Evans\n2022). They have also been the impetus for important collaborative\nwork between several sciences: in addition to being psychiatric\ndisorders delusions occur as symptoms of neurological diseases of and\ninjury to the brain, and as such have been subject to considerable\nempirical study. Philosophical research on delusions primarily\naddresses issues their intelligibility; their status in relation to\nmore normal doxastic states; and their place in explanatory\nmodels.\n\nThe intelligibility of delusions remains contested. Delusions are\nexpressed using unexceptional syntax, and some involve content that,\nwhile inaccurate or implausible, is entirely comprehensible. These,\nJaspers insisted, are secondary delusions; primary delusions, in\ncontrast, are distinguished by their meaninglessness: attributing\nmeaning to them is a misapplication of the hermeneutic approach\n(Jaspers 1913 [1963]; Gorski 2012). Others have adopted the position\nthat all delusions are meaningless utterances (Berrios 1991), and\nfindings in brain science have been employed to confirm that (Gerrans\n2014). In contrast, it is argued that delusions are always\ncomprehensible, but only within a context that includes the\nperson\u2019s whole life, ideas and values, and recognizing\nnon-literal interpretation (Bentall 2004; Wickham & Bentall 2016,\nMullen & Gillett 2014; Glover 2014; Jeppsson 2021; Gipps\n2022).\n\nDelusions are belief-like, but disagreements arise over whether they\nare beliefs, imaginings, an incomplete form of one of these two, or a\ndistinct hybrid form. The doxastic position (delusions are beliefs)\nmust somehow accommodate that compared to typical beliefs, delusions\nare not responsive to countervailing evidence, and are only weakly\nbehavior guiding. (See Flores 2021 and entry for Delusions.)\nAssociated more with imagining than with believing, these same\nfeatures have led to the assertion that delusions are imaginings\nmistakenly identified as beliefs (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002;\nBroome & Bortolotti 2009), or the hybrid concept of\n\u201cbimagining\u201d (Egan 2009).\n\nIncreasingly, explanations of delusions are multi-factorial.\nInfluential early models that grew out of research on single-themed\ndelusions resulting from brain damage, such as Capgras, hypothesized\ntwo deficiencies: an initiating aberrant experience or perception due\nto brain dysfunction, combined with some failure of the system of\n\u201cbelief fixation\u201d by which initial beliefs are critically\nreviewed in light of other information (Davies et al. 2001; Davies\n& Davies 2009; Young 2011). The second factor in such \u201ctwo\nfactor\u201d theories is faulty inference, and is on some accounts\ndistinguished by degree alone from common forms of reasoning error\nsuch as attribution bias (Bentall 2004). On \u201cprediction\nerror\u201d models, perceptual aberrations conflict with prior\n(Bayesian) expectations when accompanied by reasoning bias, giving\nrise to delusions (Stone & Young 2007; Mishara & Corlett\n2009). The \u201cpolythematic\u201d and complex delusions more often\nseen in the psychiatry clinic, that are partially driven by social and\nenvironmental factors, present significant challenges for cognitive\nscience, since they involve the higher cognitive systems that\napparently resist modular analysis and decomposition.\n",
