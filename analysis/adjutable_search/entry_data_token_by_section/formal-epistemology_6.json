    "main_text": "Second Case Study: The Problem of Induction\n2. Second Case Study: The Problem of Induction\n\nA lot of our reasoning seems to involve projecting observed patterns\nonto unobserved instances. For example, suppose I don\u2019t know\nwhether the coin I\u2019m holding is biased or fair. If I flip it 9\ntimes and it lands tails every time, I\u2019ll expect the\n10th toss to come up tails too. What justifies this kind of\nreasoning? Hume famously argued that nothing can justify it. In modern\nform, Hume\u2019s challenge is essentially this: a justification for\nsuch reasoning must appeal to either an inductive argument or a\ndeductive one. Appealing to an inductive argument would be\nunacceptably circular. While a deductive argument would have to show\nthat unobserved instances will resemble observed ones, which is not a\nnecessary truth, and hence not demonstrable by any valid argument. So\nno argument can justify projecting observed patterns onto unobserved\ncases. (Russell and Restall (2010) offer a formal development. Haack\n(1976) discusses the supposed asymmetry between induction and\ndeduction here.)\n\nCan probability come to the rescue here? What if instead of deducing\nthat unobserved instances will resemble observed ones we just deduce\nthat they\u2019ll probably resemble the observed ones? If we\ncan deduce from the probability axioms that the next toss is likely to\ncome up tails given that it landed tails 9 out of 9 times so far, that\nwould seem to solve Hume\u2019s problem.\n\nUnfortunately, no such deduction is possible: the probability axioms\nsimply don\u2019t entail the conclusion we want. How can that be?\nConsider all the different sequences of heads (\\(\\mathsf{H}\\)) and\ntails (\\(\\mathsf{T}\\)) we might get in the course of 10 tosses:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\mathsf{HHHHHHHHHH}\\\\\n\\mathsf{HHHHHHHHHT}\\\\\n\\mathsf{HHHHHHHHTH}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\mathsf{HHHHHHHHTT}\\\\\n\\mathsf{HHHHHHHTHT}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\mathsf{TTTTTTTTTH}\\\\\n\\mathsf{TTTTTTTTTT}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nThere are 1024 possible sequences, so the probability of each possible\nsequence would seem to be \\(1/1024\\). Of course, only two of them\nbegin with 9 tails in a row, namely the last two. So, once we\u2019ve\nnarrowed things down to a sequence that begins with 9 out of 9 tails,\nthe probability of tails on the 10th toss is \\(1/2\\), same\nas heads. More formally, applying the definition conditional\nprobability gives us:\n\\[\\begin{align} p(T_{10} \\mid T_{1\\ldots9})\n&= \\frac{p(T_{10} \\wedge T_{1\\ldots9})}{p(T_{1\\ldots9})}\\\\ &=\n\\frac{1/1024}{2/1024}\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2}\\end{align}\\]\n\nSo it looks like the axioms of probability entail that the\nfirst 9 tosses tell us nothing about the 10th toss.\n\nIn fact, though, the axioms of probability don\u2019t even entail\nthat\u2014they don\u2019t actually say anything about\n\\(p(T_{10} \\mid T_{1\\ldots9})\\). In the previous paragraph, we assumed\nthat each possible sequence of tosses was equally probable, with\n\\(p(\\ldots)=1/1024\\) the same for each sequence. But the probability\naxioms don\u2019t require this \u201cuniform\u201d assignment. As\nwe saw earlier when we encountered the problem of the priors\n (1.4),\n the probability axioms only tell us that tautologies have probability\n1 (and contradictions probability \\(0\\)). Contingent propositions can\nhave any probability from \\(0\\) to 1, and this includes the\nproposition that the sequence of tosses will be\n\\(\\mathsf{HHHHHHHTHT}\\), or any other sequence of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\)s and\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s.\n\nWe can exploit this freedom and get more sensible, induction-friendly\nresults if we assign prior probabilities using a different scheme\nadvocated by Carnap (1950). Suppose instead of assigning each possible\nsequence the same probability, we assign each possible number of\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s the same probability. We could get anywhere from 0 to\n10 \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s, so each possible number of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s has\nprobability 1/11. Now, there\u2019s just one way of getting 0\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s: \n\n\\[\\mathsf{HHHHHHHHHH}\\]\n\n\nSo \\(p(H_{1\\ldots10})=1/11\\). But there are 10 ways of getting 1\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\):\n\\[\\begin{array}{c} \\mathsf{HHHHHHHHHT}\\\\\n\\mathsf{HHHHHHHHTH}\\\\ \\mathsf{HHHHHHHTHH}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\\n\\mathsf{THHHHHHHHH}\\end{array}\\]\n\nSo this possibility\u2019s probability of \\(1/11\\) is divided 10\nways, yielding probability \\(1/110\\) for each subpossibility, e.g.,\n\\(p(\\mathsf{HHHHHHHTHH})=1/110\\). And then there are 45 ways of\ngetting 2 \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c} \\mathsf{HHHHHHHHTT}\\\\\n\\mathsf{HHHHHHHTHT}\\\\ \\mathsf{HHHHHHTHHT}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\\n\\mathsf{TTHHHHHHHH}\\end{array}\\]\n\nSo here the probability of \\(1/11\\) is divided \\(45\\) ways, yielding a\nprobability of \\(1/495\\) for each subpossibility, e.g.,\n\\(p(\\mathsf{HTHHHHHTHH})=1/495\\). And so on.\n\nWhat then becomes of \\(p(T_{10} \\mid T_{1\\ldots9})\\)?\n\\[\\begin{align} p(T_{10} \\mid T_{1\\ldots9})\n&= \\frac{p(T_{10} \\wedge T_{1\\ldots9})}{p(T_{1\\ldots9})}\\\\ &=\n\\frac{p(T_{1\\ldots10})}{p(T_{1\\ldots10} \\vee [T_{1\\ldots9} \\wedge\nH_{10}])}\\\\ &= \\frac{p(T_{1\\ldots10})}{p(T_{1\\ldots10}) +\np(T_{1\\ldots9} \\wedge H_{10})}\\\\ &= \\frac{1/11}{1/11 + 1/110}\\\\\n&= \\frac{10}{11}\\end{align}\\]\n\nSo we get a much more reasonable result when we assign prior\nprobabilities according to Carnap\u2019s two-stage scheme. However,\nthis scheme is not mandated by the axioms of probability.\n\nOne thing this teaches us is that the probability axioms are silent on\nHume\u2019s problem. Inductive reasoning is compatible with the\naxioms, since Carnap\u2019s way of constructing the prior\nprobabilities makes a 10th \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) quite likely\ngiven an initial string of \\(9\\) \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s. But the axioms are\nalso compatible with skepticism about induction. On the first way of\nconstructing the prior probabilities, a string of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s\nnever makes the next toss any more likely to be a \\(\\mathsf{T}\\), no\nmatter how long the string gets! In fact, there are further ways of\nconstructing the prior probabilities that yield\n\u201canti-induction\u201d, where the more \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)s we\nobserve, the less likely the next toss is to be a\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\).\n\nWe also learn something else though, something more constructive: that\nHume\u2019s problem is a close cousin of the problem of the priors.\nIf we could justify Carnap\u2019s way of assigning prior\nprobabilities, we would be well on our way to solving Hume\u2019s\nproblem. (Why only on our way? More on that in a moment, but very\nbriefly: because we\u2019d still have to justify using conditional\nprobabilities as our guide to the new, unconditional probabilities.)\nCan we justify Carnap\u2019s two-stage scheme? This brings us to a\nclassic debate in formal epistemology.\n",
