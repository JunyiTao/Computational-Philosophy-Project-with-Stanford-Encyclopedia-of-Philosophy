    "main_text": "Fatalism, Bivalence, and Determinism || Aristotle and tomorrow\u2019s sea battle\n1.1 Aristotle and tomorrow\u2019s sea battle\n\nAristotle thinks that the conclusion of the fatalist argument is\nfalse, because it is obvious that deliberation is not futile:\nwe often deliberate about what to do, act upon that deliberation, and\nthereby bring things about that otherwise would not have occurred. And\nmore generally, there are many things that are not necessary before\nthey happen, but may either occur or not occur. Aristotle gives the\nexample of a cloak wearing out: before it wore out, it did not\nhave to wear out, as it was still possible that it be cut up\ninstead. (Int. 9 19a8\u2013a22)\n\nUnfortunately, how Aristotle rejects the conclusion is less\nclear than that he rejects it, because De\nInterpretatione 9 is an extremely compressed text (see Gaskin\n1995 and chapter 6 of Van Rijen 1989 for details). But on the most\ncommon and historically influential interpretation, Aristotle responds\nto the argument by rejecting its premise, that the Principle of\nBivalence applies universally. Instead, it is true only for the most\npart and does not apply to statements about the future that can\npossibly be true or false, such as \u201cthere will be a sea battle\ntomorrow\u201d or \u201cthis cloak will be cut up\u201d.\nLet\u2019s take the statement, \u201cOver 100,000 people will die of\nCovid-19 in the United States in 2020\u201d. Before 100,001 people\ndie, it is not inevitable that this will occur; instead, it depends on\nwhat people do, and the statement is neither true nor false. Once\n100,001 people die, then the statement changes truth value from\nNeutral or Indeterminate to True, as well as becoming necessary for us\nnow, because we can no longer do anything about it.\n",
