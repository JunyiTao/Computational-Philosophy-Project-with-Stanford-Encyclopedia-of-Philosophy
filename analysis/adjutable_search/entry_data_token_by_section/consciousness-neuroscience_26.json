    "main_text": "Specific Consciousness || Neural Stimulation\n5.3 Neural Stimulation\n\nThere are limited opportunities to manipulate human brain activity in\na targeted way. Recent use of transcranial magnetic stimulation to\nactivate or suppress neural activity has provided illumination, but\nsuch interventions are coarse-grained. Ultimately, to locate an\nexplanatory correlate for specific conscious contents, we will need\nmore fine-grained interventions in brain tissue. In humans, such\nopportunities are generally confined to manipulation before surgical\ninterventions, say for brain tumors or epilepsy (see\n section 5.3.3\n for work with epilepsy patients).\n\nIn the middle of the last century, neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield and\ncolleagues performed a set of direct electrical microstimulations\nduring preoperative procedures (Penfield & Perot 1963), and in\ncertain cases induced hallucinations by stimulating primary sensory\ncortices such as V1 or S1 (see\n figure 1).\n This provided evidence that endogenous activity could be causally\nsufficient for phenomenal experiences. Penfield\u2019s interventions,\nhowever, were not based on fine-grained targeting of specific neural\nrepresentations. As Cohen and Newsome note, \n\n\nPenfield\u2019s approach failed to generate substantial new insights\ninto the neural basis of perception and cognition\u2026because the\ngross electrical activation elicited by surface electrodes could not\nbe related mechanistically to the information being processed within\nthe excited neural tissue. (Cohen & Newsome 2004: 1)\n\n\nA different approach begins with a more detailed understanding of\nunderlying neural representations tied to different brain regions. For\nexample, the fusiform face (FFA) area appears to be necessary for\nnormal human face experience in that lesions in FFA lead to\nprosopagnosia, the inability to see faces even if one can see\ntheir parts. FFA is part of a larger network that is important in\nvisual processing of faces (Behrmann & Plaut 2013). Recently,\nmicrostimulation of FFA in an awake human epilepsy patient induced\nvisual distortions of actual faces as opposed to other objects\n(Parvizi et al. 2012). Alterations of visual experience were also\nreported during microstimulating the parahippocampal place (PPA) area\nin an awake pre-operative epileptic patient that induced visual\nhallucinations of scenes (M\u00e9gevand et al. 2014). PPA is the\nsame area that showed activation in vegetative state patients when\nthey putatively imagined walking around their home\n (section 2.5).\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Ventral Stream Areas \n\nA view from the bottom of cortex with location of areas FFA, PPA and\nLO identified. Occipital cortex is on the bottom. LO is lesioned in the visual agnosic patient, DF (see\n section 4.1).\n This figure is modified from figure 1 of Behrmann and Plaut 2013, kindly provided by Marlene\nBehrmann and used with her permission.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that many neuroscientists of vision take themselves\nto be investigating seeing in the ordinary sense, one that implies\nconsciousness, but very few of them would characterize their work as\nabout consciousness. That said, their work is of direct relevance to\nour understanding of specific consciousness even if it is not always\ncharacterized as such.\n\nAn important approach in visual neuroscience was articulated by A.J.\nParker and William Newsome in \u201cSense and the Single\nNeuron\u201d (1998) via \u201cprinciples\u201d to connect\nelectrophysiological data about information processing to perception\n(for a recent discussion, see Ruff & Cohen 2014). To probe the\nneural basis of perception, neuroscientists need to explanatorily link\nneural data to the subject\u2019s perception that guides behavior.\nThe experimenter must ensure that recorded neural content correlates\nwith perceptual content and not just response. Further, manipulation\nof the neurons carrying information should affect perception: inducing\nappropriate neural activity should shift perceptual response while\nabolishing or reducing that activity should eliminate or reduce\nperceptual response as measured in behavior. These proposals address\nconcerns about necessity and sufficiency.\n\nThe intentional action inference is applicable (or at least its\nevidential version):\n\n\nIf some subject acts intentionally, where her action is guided by a\nperceptual state, then that state is phenomenally conscious.\n\n\nWe will consider the strength of this inference in three cases. The\nfirst case, visual motion perception, introduces the principles that\nguide the manipulation of neural content while the second case\nconcerns tactile experience of vibration. These cases involve\nexperiments with non-human primates, so we lack introspective reports.\nThe final case concerns direct manipulation of the human brain along\nwith introspective reports.\n\nThese experiments involve microstimulation of small populations of\nneurons that are targeted precisely because of their informational\ncontent. Microstimulation involves injecting a small current from the\ntip of an electrode inserted into brain tissue that directly\nstimulates nearby neurons or, through synaptic connections to other\nneurons, indirectly activates more distant neurons (see Histed, Ni,\n& Maunsell 2013 for a review). It is assumed that neurons\ntuned in similar ways, that is neurons that respond to\nsimilar stimuli, tend to be interconnected, so microstimulation is\ntaken to largely drive similarly tuned neurons.\n5.3.1 Visual Motion Perception\n\nWe begin with visual motion perception in primates. Since the\nprinciples introduced here are central to much perceptual neuroscience\nand provide the basis for probing the link between neural\nrepresentations and perceptual content, I examine it carefully. The\nsalient question will be whether conscious experience is changed by\nthe manipulations.\n\nThe work we shall discuss was done in awake behaving macaque monkeys.\nVisual area MT in the monkey brain (called V5 in humans) plays an\nimportant role in the visual experience of motion. MT is taken to lie\nin the dorsal visual stream\n (figure 1).\n Lesions that disrupt MT are known to cause akinetopsia, the\ninability to see motion. One patient with an MT (V5) lesion reported\nthe following phenomenology: \u201cpeople were suddenly here or there\nbut I have not seen them moving\u201d (Zihl, Von Cramon, & Mai\n1983: 315). MT processing looks to be necessary for normal visual\nmotion experience. Furthermore, MT neurons represent (carry\ninformation regarding) the direction of motion of visible stimuli: MT\nneurons are tuned for motion in specific directions with the\nhighest firing rate for a specific direction of motion (for other\nfunctions and responses of MT, see Born & Bradley 2005). By\nplacing motion stimuli in a neuron\u2019s receptive field, scientists\ncan map its tuning:\n\n\n\nFigure 5. MT Neuron Tuning Curve\n\nFigure Legend: Tuning of a neuron in MT showing a peak response in\nspiking rate at 0 degrees of motion. The dashed curve is generated when the animal is\nattending to the motion stimulus while it is in the receptive field\n(we shall not discuss the neural basis of attention, but see Wu 2014b,\nchap. 2, for a summary of the neuroscience of attention). The solid curve shows MT response when the animal is not attending to the motion stimulus in the receptive field. Figure from\nLee & Maunsell 2009.\n\n\nWhat is plotted is the activity of an MT neuron, in spikes per second,\nto a specific type of motion stimulus placed within its receptive\nfield. How to relate a tuning curve to a determinate content is\ncomplicated. Since the neural response is not simply to one stimulus\nvalue, it is not obvious that the neuron should be taken to represent\n0 degrees of motion, namely the value at its peak response. Indeed,\ntheorists have noted that the tuning curve looks like a probability\ndensity function, and many now take neurons to have\nprobabilistic content\n (section 5.4).\n\nExperimenters have trained macaque monkeys to perform discrimination\ntasks reporting direction of motion. Typically, the monkey maintains\nfixation while the moving stimulus is placed within the receptive\nfield of the recorded neuron. The monkey reports the direction of the\nstimulus by moving its eyes to a target that stands for either\nleftward or rightward motion (other behavioral reports can be\ngenerated such as moving a joystick). Provisionally, we apply the\nintentional action inference, so we assume that such reports are\nguided by conscious visual experience of the stimuli. Thus,\nchanges in behavior will be evidence for changes in conscious\ncontent.\n\nEarly work suggested that the activity of a single neuron provides a\nstrong correlate of the animal\u2019s visually guided performance.\nThis can be seen by plotting both the animal and the neuron\u2019s\nperformance across different stimulus values. In these experiments,\nthe value concerns the percent coherence of motion of a set\nof dots defined as the number of dots moving in the same direction (0%\ncoherence being random motion; 100% being all dots moving in the same\ndirection). In the first case, we construct a psychometric\ncurve that plots the animal\u2019s percent correct reports\nrelative to percent coherence of motion of the stimuli. As one might\nexpect, percent correct reports drop as coherence drops, and the\ninflection point reflects where the subject is equally likely to\nindicate left or right motion. We can do the same for the neural\nactivity of the neuron across the same stimulus values, a\nneurometric curve.\n\nThe experimentalist\u2019s window onto conscious experience is\nthrough behavior, the assumption being that report about motion\ncorrelates with perceptual experience. Correlation is assessed by\nasking the following question: would an ideal observer, using the\nactivity of the neuron in question, be able to predict the\nanimal\u2019s visually guided performance? Essentially, do the\npsychometric and neurometric curves overlap? Strikingly, yes. MT\nneurons were observed to predict the animal\u2019s behavior (Britten\net al. 1992).\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\nFigure Legend: Psychometric and Neurometric curves for a single MT\nneuron during performance of a motion direction detection task. Percent correct performance is plotted on the y-axis while percent motion coherence is plotted in a log scale on the x-axis. Figure\nmodified from Ruff & Cohen 2014 and kindly provided by Doug\nRuff.\n\n\nThis shows that the activity of a single MT neuron provides a neural\ncorrelate of the animal\u2019s visual discrimination of motion. Note\nthat this is just a neural correlate of behavior. No one suggested\nthat this neuron was causally sufficient for the behavior or for\nperception. Later results have suggested that individual neurons are\nnot quite as sensitive as Britten suggested, but that small groups of\nMT neurons are sufficient to predict behavior (Cohen &\nNewsome 2009).\n\nEarlier, we worried about mere correlates. To get causal or\nexplanatory purchase, the content of the MT neurons correlated to the\nanimal\u2019s behavior must be shown to contribute to perceptual\nguidance. This predicts that if we manipulate the content of the\nneurons, i.e., manipulate neural representations, then we should\nmanipulate the content of the animal\u2019s visual experience of\nmotion as reflected by predicted changes in behavior. This would be to\ntest sufficiency with respect to specific consciousness.\n\nNewsome and colleagues demonstrated that microstimulation of MT\nneurons shifted the animal\u2019s performance in predictable ways.\nAssume that neural population P, by encoding information about\nstimulus motion, can inform the subject\u2019s report of motion\ndirection. This information is accessible for the control of behavior.\nActivation of P by microstimulation should shift behavior in a\nmotion selective way correlated with the direction that P is\ntuned to (represents). Metaphorically, if a downstream control system\nis sensitive to the response of P when it generates behavior,\nthen if we change P in a specific way, say amplifying its\nsignal, we should change behavior in a way biased by P\u2019s\ncontent. This was first demonstrated by Salzman et al. (1990). They\ninserted electrodes into MT and identified neurons tuned to a\nparticular orientation. During a motion discrimination task,\nmicrostimulation of neurons with that tuning led to a shift in the\npsychometric curve as if that neuron was given more weight in driving\nbehavior.\n\nIn conditions of microstimulation relative to its absence, the monkey\nwas more likely to report that there was motion in the stimulated\nneuron\u2019s preferred direction. In the original experiment, the\npsychophysical effect of microstimulation was equivalent to the\naddition of 7-20% coherence in the stimulus with respect to the\nneuron\u2019s preferred direction, depending on the experimental\nconditions. Further, as a test of necessity, a selective lesion of MT\ndisrupted motion discrimination though the animals were able to\nrecover some function suggesting that other visual information streams\ncould be tapped so as to support performance (Newsome &\nPar\u00e9 1988).\n\nAdopting the intentional action inference, one can conclude that the\nmicrostimulation shifted perceptual content (or again, that we have\ngood evidence for this shift). That said, given our discussion of\nunconscious vision\n (section 4),\n another possibility is that MT microstimulation only changes\nunconscious visual representations. Newsome himself asked:\n\n\nWhat is the conscious experience that accompanies the stimulation and\nthe monkey\u2019s decision? Even if you knew everything about how the\nneurons encode and transmit information, you may not know what the\nmonkey experiences when we stimulate his MT. (Singer 2006)\n\n\nClearly, having the monkey provide an introspective report would add\nevidential weight, but obtaining such reports from non-linguistic\ncreatures is difficult. How can we get the animal to turn attention\ninward to their perceptual states in an experimental\n context?[13]\n\n5.3.2 Tactile Vibration\n\nWhat of microstimulation in the absence of a stimulus? Might we induce\nhallucinations as Penfield did in his patients? Rather than\nthe work from the Newsome group that modulated ongoing perceptual\nprocessing, the issue here is to create an internal signal that mimics\nperception. Romo et al. (1998) demonstrated that monkeys can carry out\nsensory tasks via activation triggered by microstimulation. The\nmonkeys\u2019 task was to discriminate the frequency of two\nsequential \u201cflutters\u201d on their fingertips, that is,\nmechanical vibrations on the skin at specific frequencies. In an\nexperimental trial, an initial sample flutter was presented\nfor 500 ms and after a gap of 1-3 seconds, a second test\nflutter of either higher or lower frequency was presented. The animal\nreported whether the second test frequency was higher or lower than\nthe sample.\n\nThe experimenters examined whether direct microstimulation in the\nabsence of a stimulus could tap into the same neural representations\nthat guided the animal\u2019s report. They isolated\nneurons in primary somatosensory cortex responsive to vibration\nfrequency on the fingers (S1, the somatosensory homunculus discovered\nby Penfield [Penfield & Boldrey 1937]; see\n figure 1).\n The investigators then stimulated the same neurons in S1 in the\nabsence of the test flutter, so used stimulation as a substitute for\nan actual vibration. Thus, the animal had to make a comparison between\nthe frequency of a mechanical sample to either a subsequent (1) real\nmechanical test vibration (i.e., the good case with an actual\nstimulus) or (2) to a microstimulation test stimulus (i.e., the\n\u201challucinatory\u201d case where direct activation of the S1\nneurons occurred in the absence of a stimulus). Romo et al.\ndemonstrated that discrimination performance based either on\nmechanical stimulation or microstimulation was equivalent. In\nother words, the animals could match either mechanical or\nmicrostimulation to a remembered mechanical\n sample.[14]\n\nIn subsequent work (Romo et al. 2000), the investigators inverted the\nexperiment, using the microstimulation as the sample. In this\ncase, the animals had to remember the information conveyed by the\nmicrostimulation (effectively, a hallucination) and then compare it to\neither a subsequent (a) mechanically generated stimulation on the\nfinger (actual test stimulus) or (b) a microstimulation of S1 as test\n(i.e., no stimulus). In both cases, performance was similar to earlier\nresults. The striking finding is that behavior could be driven\nentirely by microstimulation. At least for the tactile stimulations at\nissue, the animal might have been in the Matrix!\n\nOne might think that the intentional action inference is stronger in\nthis paradigm, given the elegant flipping of stimuli in Romo et al.\n2000. Still, the authors comment:\n\n\nThis study, therefore, has directly established a strong link between\nneural activity and perception. However, we do not know yet whether\nmicrostimulation of the QA circuit in S1 elicits a subjective flutter\nsensation in the fingertips. This can only be explored by\nmicrostimulating S1 in an attending human observer. (Romo et al. 2000:\n 277)[15]\n\n\nLike Newsome, the authors reach for introspection. Yet they might\nundersell their result, for it seems that the animals are having a\ntactile hallucination: (a) Penfield showed that stimulation of primary\nsensory cortices like S1 induces hallucinations in humans; (b) action\nis engaged not at low stimulation of S1 in monkeys but only at higher\nlevel stimulation; (c) at that point, when the stimulation grabs their\nattention, the monkeys do what they were trained to do, namely\ndiscriminate stimuli, either with (d) just mechanical stimulation\n(normal experience), or (e) with a mix of mechanical and\nmicrostimulation or with just microstimulation; (f) given the\nbehavioral equivalence of these three cases, one might then argue that\nif performance in the mechanical stimulation cases involves conscious\ntactile experience, then that same experience is involved in the other\ncases.\n5.3.3 Visual Word Form\n\nIn humans, language is lateralized to the left hemisphere, and in\nvisual word recognition, the left midfusiform gyrus (lmFG; sometimes\nreferred to as the visual word form area, VWFA) is important\nfor normal processing of visual word forms during reading. For\nexample, damage to lmFG affects reading in adults (Gaillard et al.\n2006; Behrmann & Shallice 1995) while learning novel words\nsharpens representations therein (Glezer et al. 2015). Nevertheless,\nit is possible that lmFG is tuned to general visual form and is not\nspecific to visual word forms. This is a common point of contention in\naddressing the function of various areas in the human visual system,\nnotably the fusiform face area (FFA): is it a content specific area or\nis it more a general visual expertise area (Kanwisher 2000; Tarr &\nGauthier 2000)?\n\nIn a recent study, Hirshorn et al. (2016) used microstimulation to\ndisrupt processing in lmFG in human epileptic patients with\npreoperatively implanted electrodes spanning that area. These\nelectrodes are used to map sites that will be surgically removed to\nrelieve intractable seizures. Subjects read words or letters during\nactual or sham microstimulation. Crucially, stimulation in lmFG\nselectively disrupted word and letter reading but not general\nform perception. During lmFG stimulation, one subject when presented\nwith \u201cillegal\u201d reported not seeing the word (see \n Movie S1\nin Other Internet Resources). Rather, she reported thinking of\ndifferent words (still, she did not report\nseeing different words). With \u201cmessage\u201d she\nreported thinking that an \u201cn\u201d was present. In a\nsecond patient, the identification of letters was completely\ndisrupted (see \n  Movie S2 in Other Internet Resources). \nThe patient reported seeing an \u201cA\u201d when presented\nwith an \u201cX\u201d, and then an \u201cF\u201d and\n\u201cH\u201d when presented with \u201cC\u201d. The\nresults suggest that normal word reading requires lmFG processing to\nparse linguistic forms. A plausible hypothesis is that\nmicrostimulation disrupted visual experience of specific types of\nstimuli, a test of necessity. That said, the first patient\u2019s\nintrospective reports of thinking rather than seeing words complicates\nmatters.\n\nTechniques for decoding information processing (using machine\nlearning) suggests that processing in lmFG becomes more finely tuned\nto word form. Initially, lmFG represents a more gist-like\nrepresentation but then develops more precise representations that\nindividuate words of similar form. These converging results provide\nevidence that the areas stimulated carry information about word form\nsuch that in disrupting that activity, word perception was selectively\ndisrupted.\n\nTaken together, the three cases provide examples of detailed\nmanipulations in different sensory modalities, animals, and contents\nthat test for causal sufficiency and necessity across different levels\nof the sensory processing hierarchy, from early levels (e.g., S1) to\nmid-levels (MT) and finally to higher levels (lmFG or FFA). Working\nbackwards, the experimental strategy is as follows: Given a perceptual\nexperience with a specific content, one identifies neural correlates\nthat carry equivalent content, say one\u2019s seeing motion, feeling\nvibration, or parsing words linked to neural correlates processing\ninformation about motion, vibrational frequency and word forms. Next,\nfine-grained manipulations of the neural content are then correlated\nwith related effects on perceptual experience. One issue that remains\nopen is whether in tapping into neural processing by microstimulation,\none has simply identified an earlier causal node in the neural\nprocesses that generate perceptual experience, there being more\ninformative neural correlates later in the causal pathway. An\nimportant question is how one might identify the neural basis of the\nexperience as opposed to its cause.\n\nA couple of salient methodological challenges stand in the way of\nexplaining specific consciousness. The first is that much of the\ndetailed work will for the foreseeable future be done on non-human\nanimals where introspective report is not easily available and where\nthe intentional action inference will be essential. To strengthen that\ninference, we will need more detailed models that make plausible that\nconscious experience figures in the generation of the observed\nbehavior. There is an experiment-theory circle that we must break\ninto: we need a theory that supports the role of consciousness in\nbehavior but the theory itself will be supported by behavioral data.\nHow will we break into this cycle? The intentional action inference\nwill be an important means of tracking consciousness, and the limits\nof its applicability must be investigated. The second challenge is\nthat there is a need to individuate different kinds of explanatory\ncorrelates of consciousness, for some will be causes (upstream of\nconscious states), some will be enabling conditions, and some will be\nconstituents of the state itself. Dividing these cases involves not\njust gathering data, but having a clear conceptual framework to draw\ndistinctions in a principled way. Clearly joint philosophical and\nexperimental work is needed.\n5.4 Neural Representation and Probabilistic Coding\n\nIn invoking neural content, the assumption is that neural content\nmirrors perceptual content, so that if one is experiencing dots moving\nin a certain direction, there is a neural representation with the same\ncontent. This is a simplification and does not cohere with a common\ncurrent approach to neural content that takes it to be\nprobabilistic. Consider again the tuning curve from an MT\nneuron, M\n (figure 5).\n\nIf asked to assign a determinate content to M, one might choose\nthe value that corresponds to its peak response, here,\n 0o.[16]\n This would be the most natural option if the tuning curve were\nessentially a sharp line at 0o, i.e., were the neuron only\nactive for its preferred stimulus but otherwise not. Of course, that\nis not the neuron\u2019s response profile, so what is the content of\nthe neural representation?\n\nOne approach that converges on a determinate content considers the\nactivity of a neural population. To evaluate more information, the\nbrain might integrate MT response by giving each MT neuron, \\(M_n\\),\none vote weighted according to the strength of its response.\nThus, the tuning curve represents how strongly the neuron votes for\nits preferred value (the value at the peak). The votes are tallied by\na downstream system, and the result can be represented as a\npopulation vector whose direction is understood to be the\ndirection represented by the neural population. This specific approach\nwas taken by Georgopoulos and colleagues to decode the direction of\nbodily movement from the activity of a population of motor neurons\n(Georgopoulos et al. 1982; for discussion of different coding\napproaches, see Pouget, Dayan, & Zemel 2003).\n\nIn recent perceptual neuroscience, an alternative picture of neural\nrepresentational content often tied to Bayesian approaches to\nperceptual computation has gained traction (for accessible\ndiscussions, see Colombo & Seri\u00e8s 2012; Rescorla 2015). On\nBayesian models, extracting information from populations of (say) MT\nneurons does not yield a specific value of motion direction but rather\na probability density function, across the space of possible\nmotion directions (for a philosophical discussion of neural\nprobabilistic codes, see Shea 2014). A key idea is not the generation\nof specific values as what neurons represent, say 0 degree motion as\nproposed earlier, but rather the conceptualization of the population\nresponse as reflecting uncertainty inherent in neural activity given\nnoise.\n\nIf we plot the activity of all MT neurons responding to a specific\nmotion stimulus, one hypothesis is that the population response codes\nthe likelihood, \\(\\pP(r\\mid s)\\), namely the conditional\nprobability that one has the observed MT response r given the\nstimulus s. A Bayesian approach to neural population codes then\nunderstands neural processing to involve computation of the\nposterior probability, \\(\\pP(s\\mid r)\\) from the likelihood\nand prior knowledge of the probability of the stimulus \\(\\pP(s)\\) in\naccordance with Bayes Theorem (this is normalized so that the\nprobabilities sum to one). The details of Bayesian computation need\nnot concern us since our main concern is with the possibility of\nneural content as probabilistic, something that seems counterintuitive\nrelative to the approach illustrated by Georgopoulos and\ncolleagues.\n\nKnill and Pouget contrast the two approaches:\n\n\nThis is the basic premise on which Bayesian theories of cortical\nprocessing will succeed or fail\u2014that the brain represents\ninformation probabilistically, by coding and computing with\nprobability density functions or approximations to probability density\nfunctions\u2026The opposing view is that neural representations are\ndeterministic and discrete, which might be intuitive but also\nmisleading. This intuition might be due to the apparent\n\u2018oneness\u2019 of our perceptual world and the need to\n\u2018collapse\u2019 perceptual representations into discrete\nactions, such as decisions or motor behaviors. (Knill & Pouget\n2004)\n\n\nHow might a probabilistic account of neural representation affect our\nthinking about phenomenal consciousness via neural\nrepresentationalism? Consider this possibility: What if probabilistic\ncontent is pervasive? Pouget, Dayan and Zemel note:\n\n\ndecoding is not an essential neurobiological operation because there\nis almost never a reason to decode the stimulus explicitly. Rather,\nthe population code is used to support computations involving\ns, whose outputs are represented in the form of yet more\npopulation codes over the same or different collections of neurons.\n(2003: 385)\n\n\nPut another way, the determinacy is apparent only at the output stage,\nthe goal of processing. In the case of motor action, neural content is\nprobabilistic until the actual movement when a determinate path is\nimplemented in a specific movement trajectory.\n\nYet perceptual content does not seem probabilistic. This\nemphasizes a prima facie disconnect between current theories\nof neural content and those of phenomenal content. The linking\nprinciples we have deployed assume a specific view of neural content\nthat might not cohere with current approaches to neural coding,\nleaving us with the challenge of explanatorily linking probabilistic\ncontent at the neural level with more determinate, nonprobabilistic\ncontent at the phenomenal level. One option is to find\nnonprobabilistic content at the neural level (e.g., as in the\npopulation vector approach). The other is to find probabilistic\ncontent at the phenomenal level (for related ideas, see Morrison 2017\nand response by Denison 2017; also Block 2018). Either way,\nexplanations of specific content will need to deal with this prima\nfacie disconnect between phenomenal content as revealed by\nintrospection and current theories of neural content.\n6. The Future\n\nTalk of the neuroscience of consciousness has, thus far, focused on\nthe neural correlates of consciousness. Not all neural correlates\nare explanatory, so finding correlates is a first step in the\nneuroscience of consciousness. The next step involves manipulation of\nrelevant correlates to test claims about sufficiency and necessity, as\nisolated in our two questions:\n\n\nGeneric Consciousness: What conditions/states N of\nnervous systems are necessary and (or) sufficient for a mental state,\nM, to be conscious as opposed to not?\n\nSpecific Consciousness: What neural states or properties are\nnecessary and/or sufficient for a conscious perceptual state to have\ncontent X rather than Y?\n\n\nA productive neuroscience of consciousness requires that we understand\nthe relevant neural properties at the right level of analysis. For\ngeneric consciousness, this will involve manipulation of relevant\nproperties in a way that can avoid the access/phenomenal confound, and\nrecent work focuses on pitting the many theories we have considered\nagainst each other. For specific consciousness, the critical issue\nwill be to understand neural representational content and to find ways\nto link experimentally and explanatorily neural content to phenomenal\ncontent. We have tools to manipulate neural contents to affect\nphenomenal content, and in doing so, we can begin to uncover the\nneural basis of conscious contents. There is much interesting work yet\nto be done, philosophically and empirically, and we can look forward\nto a productive interdisciplinary research program.",
