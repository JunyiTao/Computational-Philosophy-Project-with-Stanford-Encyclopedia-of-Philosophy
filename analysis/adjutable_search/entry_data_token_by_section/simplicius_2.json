    "main_text": "The Decisive Role of Alexander of Aphrodisias\n3. The Decisive Role of Alexander of Aphrodisias\n\nIf one were to name a single commentator apart from Simplicius\u2019\nNeoplatonic sources (esp. Porphyry and Iamblichus) who mostly strongly\nshaped his commentaries, it would undoubtedly be Alexander of\nAphrodisias (around 200 CE):\n\n\n[It is] profitable for those who choose to understand and explain\nAristotle\u2019s thought by way of Alexander\u2019s commentaries, to\nexamine what he said. (Simplicius, In Cael. 297.8\u201310,\ntranslated by J. Hankinson)\n\n\nBaltussen used this telling quotation to preface the chapter on\nAlexander of Aphrodisias in his monograph on Simplicius (2008: 107).\nIt illustrates rather well that Simplicius by no means blindly\nfollowed \u201cthe commentator\u201d (ho\nex\u00eag\u00eat\u00eas), as he calls him (In Phys.\n1170.2, In Cael. 121.12 and 700.9), but was eager to\ncarefully examine what Alexander had to say. It is known, for\ninstance, that Simplicius had direct access to Alexander\u2019s\ncommentaries on the Physics, the Heavens, and the\nCategories. All of these are now lost, but a good deal can be\nreconstructed based on Simplicius\u2019 testimony (see the overview\nin Kupreeva [2018: 387-388 and 443]). It can even be said without exaggeration that\nlarge parts of Simplicius\u2019 oeuvre are, in fact, extended\nconversations with \u201cAristotle\u2019s most famous exegete\u201d\n(Baltussen 2016: 1). While Simplicius owes much to Alexander, his\nattitude towards him is ambiguous and comparable to how Syrianus deals\nwith Alexander\u2019s Commentary on the Metaphysics.\nSyrianus focuses especially on those passages where Aristotle attacks\nPythagorean-Platonic metaphysics (esp. in books 13 and 14 of the\nMetaphysics), but in other cases, Alexander\u2019s comments\nsuffice (O\u2019Meara & Dillon 2008: 5). In other words,\nAlexander\u2019s comments generally have great value; he is the more\ngenuine (gn\u00easi\u00f4teros) commentator on Aristotle\n(In Phys. 80.15\u201316), especially as far as the\nPeripatetic tradition is concerned. Moreover, while Aristotle is the\nmost genuine disciple of Plato (gn\u00easi\u00f4tatos),\nAlexander is the \u201cmost careful of Aristotle\u2019s\npartisans\u201d (epimelestatos spoudast\u00eas, In\nCael. 378.20\u201322, borrowing the translation from\nMueller).\n\nOn the other hand, Alexander of Aphrodisias can also be a stumbling\nblock for integrating Aristotle into the Platonic tradition. This is\nreflected in several passages where Simplicius remarks on\nAlexander\u2019s way of explaining Aristotle and, more specifically,\nhis attitude towards Plato. For while Simplicius as a rule tries to\nexplain away critical remarks that Aristotle aimed at his teacher, for\ninstance, via the distinction between the superficial meaning of a\ntext (lexis, to phainomenon) and its real purpose\n(dianoia, nous), Alexander always sides with\nAristotle against Plato:\n\n\nIt is my opinion that Alexander of Aphrodisias obviously understands\nthe words of Aristotle well on other occasions\u2014and does so\nbetter than the other Peripatetics, but, in the case of the things\nwhich Aristotle says concerning Plato, he does not seem to me to bear\nin mind that Aristotle\u2019s counter-arguments are directed at the\nsurface import of Plato\u2019s statements (pros to\nphainomenon). But, contesting Plato frivolously\n(kakoschol\u00f4s) in a way, he tries not only, as Aristotle\nalso does, to refute the surface import of what Plato says, taking\nsimpler <people> into consideration, but he also attacks the\nideas (tas ennoias) of the divine Plato and tries to draw\nconsequences from what Plato says, frequently not even attending to\nthe surface import.\n\nConsequently I, setting out the truth, which is dear to god and to\nAristotle, will here try to do a careful investigation, putting\nforward the things which Alexander says are the opinions of Plato\nabout the motion of the soul. I do this because of those who deal with\nhis words in a more superficial way and dare to take from them in a\nway which is hostile to the views of Plato, which is the same as to\nsay hostile to the opinions of Aristotle and to divine truth.\n(Simplicius, In Cael. 377.20\u201334, translated by I.\nMueller)\n\nBut Alexander von Aphrodisias does not understand Plato\u2019s\ndoctrines as Aristotle understood them, nor does he accept that their\nviews are in agreement (sumph\u00f4nia) [\u2026].\n(Simplicius, In Cael. 297.1\u20134, translated by R. J.\nHankinson)\n\nI have said these things against Alexander for, while I respect the\nman and wish him well, I think that honouring the truth the more is\ndear to him too. (Simplicius, In Cael. 301.19\u201321,\ntranslated by R. J. Hankinson)\n\nBut Alexander, although he is accustomed to drag in Plato even where\nhe is quite irrelevant, for some reason has here forgotten Plato\ninstead. (Simplicius, In Phys. 560.11\u201313, translated by\nJ. O. Urmson)\n\n",
