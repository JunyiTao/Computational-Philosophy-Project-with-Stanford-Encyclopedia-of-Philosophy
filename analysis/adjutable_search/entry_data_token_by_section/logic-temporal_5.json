Prior\u2019s basic tense logic TL\n\nIn this section, we discuss the language, semantics, and\naxiomatization of the basic tense logic TL introduced by Prior (1957;\n1967; 1968), the founding father of temporal logic. Prior\u2019s\nmotivation for inventing tense logic was largely philosophical, and\nhis ideas were strongly inspired by the use of tense in natural\nlanguage. The innovative feature of Prior\u2019s approach was that he\ntreated propositions as tensed rather than tenseless. Technically,\nthis was achieved by the introduction of temporal operators into the\nlanguage, which were given a modal-logic type of semantics. In view of\nthe pivotal role that tense is playing in his framework, Prior himself\nreferred to his account as Tense Logic, whereas nowadays the\nmore general expression Temporal Logic is prevailing.\n",
