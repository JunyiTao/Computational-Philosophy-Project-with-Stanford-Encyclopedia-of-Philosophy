    "main_text": "Knowledge and Belief || \u2018Three Varieties of Knowledge\u2019\n4.1 \u2018Three Varieties of Knowledge\u2019\n\nIn Davidson\u2019s work the question \u2018what is meaning?\u2019\nis replaced by the question \u2018What would a speaker need to know\nto understand the utterances of another?\u2019 The result is an\naccount that treats the theory of meaning as necessarily part of a\nmuch broader theory of interpretation and, indeed, of a much broader\napproach to the mental as such. This account is holistic inasmuch as\nit requires that any adequate theory must address linguistic and\nnon-linguistic behaviour in its entirety. As we have already seen,\nthis means that a theory of interpretation must adopt a compositional\napproach to the analysis of meaning; it must recognise the\ninterconnected character of attitudes and of attitudes and behaviour;\nand it must also attribute attitudes and interpret behaviour in a way\nconstrained by normative principles of rationality. Rationality is\nnot, however, the only principle on which Davidson\u2019s account of\nradical interpretation depends. It involves, in fact, a marriage of\nboth holistic and \u2018externalist\u2019 considerations:\nconsiderations concerning the dependence of attitudinal content on the\nrational connections between attitudes (\u2018holism\u2019) and\nconcerning the dependence of such content on the causal connections\nbetween attitudes and objects in the world\n(\u2018externalism\u2019). Indeed, this marriage is evident, as we\nsaw earlier, in the principle of charity itself and its combination of\nconsiderations of both \u2018coherence\u2019 and\n\u2018correspondence\u2019. Davidson holds, in fact, that attitudes\ncan be attributed, and so attitudinal content determined, only on the\nbasis of a triangular structure that requires interaction between at\nleast two creatures as well as interaction between each creature and a\nset of common objects in the world.\n\nIdentifying the content of attitudes is a matter of identifying the\nobjects of those attitudes, and, in the most basic cases, the objects\nof attitudes are identical with the causes of those same attitudes (as\nthe cause of my belief that there is a bird outside my window is the\nbird outside my window). Identifying beliefs involves a process\nanalogous to that of \u2018triangulation\u2019 (as employed in\ntopographical surveying and in the fixing of location) whereby the\nposition of an object (or some location or topographical feature) is\ndetermined by taking a line from each of two already known locations\nto the object in question \u2013 the intersection of the lines fixes\nthe position of the object (this idea first appears in \u2018Rational\nAnimals [1982]). Similarly, the objects of propositional attitudes are\nfixed by looking to find objects that are the common causes, and so\nthe common objects, of the attitudes of two or more speakers who can\nobserve and respond to one another\u2019s behaviour. In \u2018Three\nVarieties of Knowledge\u2019, Davidson develops the idea of\ntriangulation as a means to elaborate the three-way conceptual\ninterdependence that he argues obtains between knowledge of oneself,\nknowledge of others and knowledge of the world. Just as knowledge of\nlanguage cannot be separated from our more general knowledge of the\nworld, so Davidson argues that knowledge of oneself, knowledge of\nother persons and knowledge of a common, \u2018objective\u2019 world\nform an interdependent set of concepts no one of which is possible in\nthe absence of the others.\n\nThe idea of triangulation has important implications that go far\nbeyond questions of knowledge alone, and the idea is one of the most\nimportant and enduring, but also controversial elements in\nDavidson\u2019s later thinking (see Myers and Verheggen, 2016).\nMoreover, although the idea may appear at first sight to be intended\npurely as a metaphor, the structure of triangulation seems actually to\ndirect attention to the way in which knowledge, action, and content\nare fundamentally dependent on the genuinely embodied and located\ncharacter of speakers and agents. As Davidson presents matters, it is\nonly through their concrete engagement in the world, in relation both\nto objects and to other speakers or agents, that a putative speaker or\nagent can be capable of genuine speaking or agency; only then can they\nspeak, act, or think.\n\nThe emphasis on the holistic and externalist character of knowledge\nand of content that is so central to triangulation is also expressed\nin Davidson\u2019s well-known \u2018Swampman\u2019 example (in\n\u2018Knowing One\u2019s own Mind\u2019, Davidson 1987:\n443\u20134) Here we are asked to imagine a situation in which a\nlightning strike in a swamp reduces Davidson\u2019s body to its basic\nelements, while simultaneously transforming a nearby dead tree into an\nexact replica of him. Although the resulting \u2018Swampman\u2019\nbehaves exactly like the original author of \u2018Radical\nInterpretation\u2019, Davidson denies that the \u2018Swampman\u2019\ncould properly be said to have thoughts or its words have meaning\n\u2013 and the reason is simply that the Swampman would lack the sort\nof causal history that is required in order to establish the right\nconnections between itself, others and the world that underpin the\nattribution of thought and meaning. For all its notoriety, however,\nthe Swampman example is not elaborated upon by Davidson, and the\nexample has a very limited usefulness. In this respect, the attention\nSwampman has generated is quite disproportionate to his extremely\nbrief appearance in Davidson\u2019s writing.\n",
