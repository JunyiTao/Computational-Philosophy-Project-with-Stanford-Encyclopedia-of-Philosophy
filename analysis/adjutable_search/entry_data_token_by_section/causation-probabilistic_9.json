    "main_text": "Probability-raising Theories of Causation || Screening off\n2.2 Screening off\n\nHans Reichenbach\u2019s The Direction of Time was published\nposthumously in 1956. In it, Reichenbach is concerned with the origins\nof temporally asymmetric phenomena, particularly the increase in\nentropy dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. In this work, he\npresents the first fully developed probabilistic theory of causation,\nalthough some of the ideas can be traced back to an earlier paper from\n1925 (Reichenbach 1925).\n\nReichenbach introduced the terminology of screening off to\ndescribe a particular type of probabilistic relationship. If \\(\\PP(E\n\\mid A \\amp C) = \\PP(E \\mid C)\\), then C is said to\nscreen A off from E. When \\(\\PP(A \\amp C) \\gt 0\\), this\nequality is equivalent to \\(\\PP(A \\amp E \\mid C) = \\PP(A \\mid\nC) \\times \\PP(E \\mid C)\\); i.e., A and E are\nprobabilistically independent conditional upon C.\n\nReichenbach recognized that there were two kinds of causal structure\nin which C will typically screen A off from E.\nThe first occurs when A causes C, which in turn causes\nE, and there is no other route or process by which A\neffects E. This is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nIn this case, Reichenbach said that C is causally\nbetween A and E. We might say that C is an\nintermediate cause between A and E, or that C is\na proximate cause of E and A a distal cause of E.\nFor example, unprotected sex (A) causes AIDS (E) only by\ncausing HIV infection (C). Then we would expect that among\nthose already infected with HIV, those who became infected through\nunprotected sex would be no more likely to contract AIDS than those\nwho became infected in some other way.\n\nThe second type of case that produces screening off occurs when\nC is a common cause of A and E, such as in the\nbarometer example depicted in\n Figure 1.\n A drop in atmospheric pressure (C) causes both a drop in the\nlevel of mercury in a barometer (A) and a storm (E).\n(This notation is slightly different from one used earlier.) The\natmospheric pressure will screen off the barometer reading from the\nweather: given that the atmospheric pressure has dropped, the\nreading of the barometer makes no difference for the probability of\nwhether a storm will occur.\n\nReichenbach used the apparatus of screening off to address the problem\nof spurious correlations. In our example, while a drop in the column\nof mercury (A) raises the probability of a storm (E)\noverall, it does not raise the probability of a storm when we further\ncondition on the atmospheric pressure. That is, if A and\nE are spuriously correlated, then A will be screened off\nfrom E by a common cause. More specifically, suppose that\n\\(C_t\\) and \\(E_{t'}\\) are events that occur at times t and\n\\(t'\\) respectively. Then\n\n(Reich)\n\\(C_t\\) is a cause of \\(E_{t'}\\) if and only if:\n    \ni.\n\\(t \\lt t'\\)\nii.\n\\(\\PP(E_{t'} \\mid C_t) \\gt \\PP(E_{t'} \\mid {\\nsim}C_t)\\); and\niii.\nThere is no further event B\\(_{t''}\\), occurring at \n        a time \\(t''\\) earlier than or simultaneously with t, \n        that screens \\(E_{t'}\\) off from \\(C_t\\).\n\n\n\n\nNote the restriction of \\(t''\\) to times earlier than or\nsimultaneously with the occurrence of \\(C_t\\). That is because causal\nintermediates between \\(C_t\\) and \\(E_{t'}\\) will often screen \\(C_t\\)\noff from \\(E_{t'}\\). In such cases we still want to say that \\(C_t\\)\nis a cause of \\(E_{t'}\\), albeit a distal or indirect cause.\n\nSuppes (1970) independently offered an equivalent definition of\ncausation, although his motivation for the no-screening-off condition\nwas different from Reichenbach\u2019s. Suppes extended the framework\nin a number of directions. While Reichenbach was interested in\nprobabilistic causation primarily in connection with issues that arise\nwithin the foundations of statistical mechanics, Suppes was interested\nin defining causation within the framework of probabilistic models of\nscientific theories. For example, Suppes offers an extended discussion\nof causation in the context of psychological models of learning.\n",
