    "main_text": "Practical Reason:  Intentions, Rules, and Normativity || Rules and Normativity\n7.3 Rules and Normativity\nWe can see from his reconstruction of moral judgment that Sellars\nthinks that things like normativity and rules exist only in a social\ncontext, for real \u2018oughts\u2019 require a community.  The\nconcept of a rule plays a central role in Sellars\u2019s philosophy,\nfor he thinks of both languages and well-ordered societies as\nrule-governed systems.  Rules, he thinks, are distinctively human.  \nTo say that man is a rational animal, is to say that man\nis a creature not of habits, but of rules. When God\ncreated Adam, he whispered in his ear, \u201cIn all contexts of\naction you will recognize rules, if only the rule to grope for rules\nto recognize.  When you cease to recognize rules, you will walk on\nfour feet.\u201d (LRB \u00a716, in PPPW: 138)\nThe language of individual and community intentions that Sellars\nclaims must be preserved in the Peircean scientific millennium is the\nlanguage that enables us to make sense of rules.  Sellars has\ninteresting things to say about rules, so this overview finishes with\na look at this significant aspect of his work.\nRule-governed behavior exhibits a pattern, but it contrasts with\nhabitual behavior, which also exhibits patterns.  Here Sellars is\nworried particularly about linguistic behavior, but the points apply\ngenerally:\nThe key to the concept of a linguistic rule is its complex\nrelation to pattern-governed linguistic behavior. The general concept\nof pattern governed behavior is a familiar one. Roughly it is the\nconcept of behavior which exhibits a pattern, not because it is\nbrought about by the intention that it exhibit this pattern, but\nbecause the propensity to emit behavior of the pattern has been\nselectively reinforced, and the propensity to emit behavior which does\nnot conform to this pattern selectively extinguished. (MFC:\n423)\nPattern-governed behavior is present wherever there is learning,\nbut that includes learning bad habits.  Some pattern-governed\nbehavior, however, exists because of rules.  \n\n\nIf patterned governed behavior can arise by \u201cnatural\u201d\nselection, it can also arise by purposive selection on the part of\ntrainers. They can be construed as reasoning.\n\nPattern-behavior of such and such a kind ought to be\nexhibited by trainees, hence we, the trainers, ought to do this and\nthat, as likely to bring it about that it is exhibited (MFC:\n423).\n\nSellars distinguishes two different kinds of \n\u2018oughts\u2019 or rules. There are\nought-to-dos, aka rules of action.  The basic form of such a\nrule is a conditional imperative: \u201cIf in circumstances C, do\nA!\u201d This is the kind of rule involved in what I\ncall paradigmatic rule-obeying.  Paradigmatic rule-obedience requires\ncomplex cognitive and conative capacities on the part of the agent:\nknowledge of the rule, recognition of the circumstances as appropriate\nto the application of the rule, and conative structures that motivate\none to apply the rule and act on it.  Sellars denies\nthat all rule-governed behaviors, behaviors that occur because of the\nrules are cases of paradigmatic rule-obedience.  \nSellars\u2019s other \u2018ought\u2019 is\nthe ought-to-be, aka rules of criticism.  For example, it ought\nto be the case that dogs come when their masters call.  Such a rule\nspeaks to no agent in particular, and it is certainly not a rule that\ndogs obey in the paradigmatic sense.  It simply endorses a\nparticular state of affairs without regard for any mode of achieving\nit.  Still, dogs can exhibit a pattern of behavior that accords with\nthe rule, and they can do so because of the rule, if their\nmasters train them to come when called because the masters have\nreasoned along the following lines:\nIt ought to be the case that dogs come when their masters\ncall.  Therefore, it ought to be the case that my dog comes when\nI call.  My dog will come when called only if I train it to do\nso.  Therefore, I ought to train my dog to come when\ncalled.\nThis reasoning moves from an ought-to-be to a relevant ought-to-do\nand comes to full fruition not in a belief about one\u2019s\nobligations, but in a set of actions that result in one\u2019s dog\nlearning to come when called.  Ought-to-be\u2019s imply\nought-to-do\u2019s; and ought-to-do\u2019s typically lead to\naction.\nThis last point is crucial.  According to Sellars, rules of\ncriticism (ought-to-be\u2019s) have no way of being realized in the\nworld (other than merely accidentally) except insofar as there\nare agents who recognize them, infer rules of action from them\nand thereupon undertake the requisite actions.  Unless there are\nagents cognizant of and acting on some rules of action, talk\nof any rules, including the apparently less committal rules of\ncriticism, turns out to be empty.  We are rule-governed creatures\nbecause we conceive of ourselves as rule-governed creatures.  And, as\nlong as we do conceive of ourselves as governed by rules and train\nourselves and our progeny to recognize and live in accordance with\nrules, it is true that we are rule-governed creatures. By taking ourselves to be persons, agents acting for reasons in accordance with rules, we make ourselves persons. \n",
