    "main_text": "Global Consequentialism\n5. Global Consequentialism\n\nSome writers propose that the purest and most consistent form of\nconsequentialism is the view that absolutely everything should be\nassessed by its consequences, including not only acts but also rules,\nmotives, the imposition of sanctions, etc. Let us follow Pettit and\nSmith (2000) in referring to this view as global\nconsequentialism. Kagan (2000) pictures it as multi-dimensional direct\nconsequentialism, in that each thing is assessed directly in terms of\nwhether its own consequences are as good as the consequences of\nalternatives.\n\nHow does this global consequentialism differ from what we have been\ncalling partial rule-consequentialism? What we have been calling\npartial rule-consequentialism is nothing but the combination of the\nact-consequentialist criterion of moral wrongness with the\nrule-consequentialist decision procedure. So defined, partial\nrule-consequentialism leaves open the question of when moral sanctions\nare appropriate.\n\nSome partial rule-consequentialists say that agents should be blamed\nand feel guilty whenever they fail to choose an act that would result\nin the best consequences. A much more reasonable position for a\npartial rule-consequentialist to take is that agents should be blamed\nand feel guilty whenever they choose an act that is forbidden by the\nrule-consequentialist decision procedure, whether or not that\nindividual act fails to result in the best consequences. Finally,\npartial rule-consequentialism, as we have defined it, is compatible\nwith the claim that whether agents should be blamed or feel guilty\ndepends not on the wrongness of what they did, nor on whether the\nrecommended procedure for making moral decisions would have led them\nto choose the act they choose, but instead solely on whether this\nblame or guilt will do any good. This is precisely the view of\nsanctions that global consequentialism takes.\n\nOne objection to global consequentialism is that simultaneously\napplying a consequentialist criterion to acts, decision procedures,\nand the imposition of sanctions leads to apparent paradoxes (Crisp\n1992; Streumer 2003; Lang 2004).\n\nSuppose, on the whole and in the long run, the best decision procedure\nfor you to accept is one that leads you to do act x now. But\nsuppose also that in fact the act with the best consequences in this\nsituation is not x but y. So global consequentialism\ntells you (a) to use the best possible decision procedure but also (b)\nnot to do the act picked out by this decision procedure. That seems\nparadoxical.\n\nThings get worse when we consider blame and guilt. Suppose you follow\nthe best possible decision procedure but fail to do the act with the\nbest consequences. Are you to be blamed? Should you feel guilty?\nGlobal consequentialism claims that you should be blamed if and only\nif blaming you will produce the best consequences, and that you should\nfeel guilty if and only if this will produce the best consequences.\nSuppose that for some reason the best consequences would result from\nblaming you for following the prescribed decision procedure (and thus\ndoing x). But surely it is paradoxical for a moral theory to\ncall for you to be blamed although you followed the moral decision\nprocedure mandated by the theory. Or suppose that for some reason the\nbest consequences would result from blaming you for intentionally\nchoosing the act with the best consequences (y). Again,\nsurely it is paradoxical for a moral theory to call for you to be\nblamed although you intentionally chose the very act required by the\ntheory.\n\nSo one problem with global consequentialism is that it creates\npotential gaps between what acts it claims to be required and what\ndecision procedures it tells agents to use, and between each of these\nand blamelessness. (For explicit replies to this line of attack, see\nDriver 2014: 175 and de Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014:\n315\u201316.)\n\nThat is not the most familiar problem with global consequentialism.\nThe most familiar problem with it is instead its maximising\nact-consequentialist criterion of wrongness. According to this\nmaximising criterion, an act is wrong if and only if it fails to\nresult in the greatest good. This criterion judges some acts to be not\nwrong which certainly seem to be wrong. It also judges some acts that\nseem not wrong to be wrong.\n\nFor example, consider an act of murder that results in slightly more\ngood than any other act would have produced. According to the most\nfamiliar, maximising act-consequentialist criterion of wrongness, this\nact of murder is not wrong. Many other kinds of act such as\nassaulting, stealing, promise breaking, and lying can be wrong even\nwhen doing them would produce slightly more good than not doing them\nwould. Again, the familiar, maximising form of act-consequentialism\ndenies this.\n\nOr consider someone who gives to her child, or keeps for herself, some\nresource of her own instead of contributing it to help some stranger\nwho would have gained slightly more from that resource. Such an action\nhardly seems wrong. Yet the maximising act-consequentialist criterion\njudges it to be wrong. Indeed, imagine how much self-sacrifice an\naveragely well-off person would have to make before her further\nactions satisfied the maximising act-consequentialist criterion of\nwrongness. She would have to give to the point where further\nsacrifices from her in order to benefit others would harm her more\nthan they would benefit the others. Thus, the maximising\nact-consequentialist criterion of wrongness is often accused of being\nunreasonably demanding.\n\nThe objections just directed at maximising act-consequentialism could\nbe side-stepped by a version of act-consequentialism that did not\nrequire maximising the good. This sort of act-consequentialism is now\ncalled satisficing consequentialism. See the entry on\n consequentialism/\n for more on such a theory.\n",
