    "main_text": "Extended Simples || For Extended Simples #2: from String Theory\n5.2 For Extended Simples #2: from String Theory\n\nAs McDaniel (2007a: 235\u20136) notes, some physicists interpret\nstring theory as positing extended simples. McDaniel quotes a passage\nfrom Brian Greene:\n\n\nWhat are strings made of? There are two possible answers to this\nquestion. First, strings are truly fundamental\u2014they are\n\u201catoms,\u201d uncuttable constituents. \u2026 As the absolute\nsmallest constituents of anything and everything, they represent the\nend of the line \u2026 in the numerous layers of substructure in the\nmicroscopic world. From this perspective, even though strings have\nspatial extent, the question of their composition is without any\ncontent. Were strings to be made of something smaller they would not\nbe fundamental. Instead, whatever strings were composed of would\nimmediately displace them and lay claim to being an even more basic\nconstituent of the universe \u2026 [A] string is simply a\nstring\u2014as there is nothing more fundamental, it can't be\ndescribed as being composed of any other substance. (1999:\n141\u20132)\n\n\nCan strings be treated as being identical to the spacetime regions at\nwhich they are exactly located? Greene does not explicitly address\nthis question. If the answer is \u2018Yes\u2019, however, and if\nstrings are exactly located only at complex regions, then string\ntheory would not be committed to extended simples after all. For an\nargument that string theory does not posit extended simples, see Baker\n(2016).\n",
