    "main_text": "The Labor Question\n3. The Labor Question\n\nLange developed an interest in, and sympathy for, labor movements in\ntheir socialist and communist manifestations from the very early days\nof his university career. He should probably be regarded as occupying\na middle position between left liberalism and socialism.\n\nThe first edition of the Arbeiterfrage was created in\nresponse to heated debates about political strategy in the developing\nlabor movement. It was followed by a second and third edition that\ntook up more theoretical questions. The Arbeiterfrage was,\nlike the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and others of the\nperiod, shaped by a direct experience of rapid industrialization. A\ncrucial consequence of this industrialization was the generation of an\nimpoverished urban working\n class.[6]\n The heart of this process in Germany was in the Ruhrgebiet and in the\nRhineland, where Lange lived. Lange concluded that the solution to the\nproblem of what to do about the working class, the\n\u201cArbeiterfrage\u201d\u2014literally the \u201cworker\nquestion\u201d\u2014as it was called, must come from the workers\nthemselves. This required politically organizing the workers and their\norganizations to form a front against the bourgeoisie (Irmer 1975,\n2).\n\nLange\u2019s position is one of socialist Darwinism (as\nopposed to social Darwinism). Lange accepted a modified\nversion of Thomas Malthus\u2019s concerns about the relation between\nincreases in population and food production: \u201cThe truth of the\nMalthusian theory consists therefore in this, that the growth of the\npopulation constantly reaches the limit that the growth of the means\nof subsistence permits\u201d (Lange 1975b, 31; Weikart 1999, 86).\nThis is an essential part of the explanation of the social conditions\nof the working class. He quotes Darwin (Chapter 3 of Origin)\nto emphasize that population pressure lies behind the struggle for\nexistence for all organisms. This, he emphasizes, includes humans\n(Lange 1894, 2). Within capitalism, the struggle for existence for the\nworking class becomes a struggle for wages.\n\nMalthus granted in principle that measures like contraception could\nprevent the increase in population that reduces standards of living to\nthe subsistence level but he held out little hope. Lange was more\nsanguine, but the positive note in his book may have come too late to\nprevent its opening chapters from ensuring its unpopularity. The talk\nof the struggle for existence, and the rigid-sounding laws that govern\nit, could hardly have been inspiring to the workers\u2019 movement it\nwas meant for (Mehring 1960, 352). Nonetheless, Lange did not draw the\nconclusions from Darwin that the social Darwinists did. He did not\ntake Darwinism as supporting capitalism, in part because he took it to\nbe a mistake to straightforwardly infer any normative conclusions from\nthe Darwinian explanatory claims: \u201cWhere Darwinism assumes that gross\nchanges can be explained in terms of the \u2018summation of slight\nindividual variations\u2019 over millennia, Lange suggests that this\nwill not suffice as an all-purpose explanatory framework. In some\ncases, he thinks, it is necessary to appeal to organisms\u2019\ncapacity to initiate rapid, deliberate change\u201d (Clarke 2021, 299). In\nkeeping with this critical perspective, Lange seemed to regard the\nprinciples appealed to in Darwin and Malthus as natural tendencies\nthat could be mitigated by human reason. These explanatory laws do not\ndetermine how we should think, nor do they determine how we must\ninevitably think:\n\nIn our present writing on the labor question Darwin plays a large\nrole, insofar as we have attempted to derive the conditions which\nproduce the labor question from the principles developed by Darwin,\nwithout, however, viewing them as absolutely necessary ingredients of\nhuman existence. (Lange 1975b, 30\u201331; Weikart 1999, 89)\n\n\nJust as human reason can control and mitigate the struggle for\nexistence among the plants we cultivate, it can control and mitigate\nthe struggle for existence among humans.\n\nOnce the quality of their living conditions becomes high enough, the\nworking class will become reasonable enough to be susceptible to\nrational arguments in favor of having a reasonable number of children.\nTheir lack of rationality in this matter is a result of their misery\nand ignorance. The improvement of living conditions to a sufficient\nlevel requires organizing the working class so that they can demand\nbetter wages and a decrease in the concentration of capital. This may\nbe possible while maintaining private property in the means of\nproduction, but, if not, we should try for communism, or whatever\nother path promises success, including various forms of mixed\neconomies. We will only learn slowly through experience what the best\nsystem is (Lange 1866a, 113\u2013114; Lange 1894a,\n212\u2013262).\n\nIt is important to note, given the political context in which Lange\nwas writing, that he did not seem to think that some revolutionary act\nwould bring us suddenly closer to such improved conditions of\nexistence. He saw the process of such development as a slow one.\nSimply changing the legal property relations or the official structure\nof the state will not be sufficient, he argues. What is required in\naddition to changes in the structure of the state and the legal system\nare fundamental changes in the way people think, which will always\ntake time. The reform of the state and laws provides the preconditions\nfor this change in consciousness, but does not bring about this change\nimmediately. Lange is careful not to deny that the kind of revolution\nsome socialists and communists supported could bring us closer to the\ngoal. But any such revolution would be merely one step in a long\nprocess that will involve both progress and regress (Lange 1894a,\n249\u2013251).\n\nOn the other hand \u201cthe view that the state has nothing to do\nwith the matter\u201d is just as mistaken (Lange 1894a, 250). Lange\ncriticizes the kind of self-help approach that some of the liberal\nmiddle-class, in particular Franz-Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch, famously\npushed. Schulze-Delitzsch believed that the goals of the liberal\nbourgeoisie and the working class did not have to be thought of as in\nconflict.The problems facing the working class could be dealt with\nwithin the existing capitalist mode of production. The working class,\nto put it crudely, could, thanks to the help of a series of consumer,\ncredit and production cooperatives, educate itself and save enough\nmoney to compete with capitalists on their own terms. Lange thought\nthis position was completely unrealistic, and that those who pushed it\nfailed to actually listen to the workers themselves. He criticized the\npaternalistic attitude of these liberal reformers and mocked their\ninability to even understand the dialects spoken by many of the\nworkers.\n\nMarx and Engels disagreed strongly with Lange\u2019s position\n(Weikart 1999, 31; Marx and Engels 1975, 43: 158, 527\u2013528). The\nview Engels expresses in a letter to Lange seems to be that taking the\nMalthusian view requires treating what is a historical law, in other\nwords a contingent law that holds during a particular mode of\nproduction, as an \u201ceternal\u201d law. The problem of producing\nenough is a problem generated by the existing mode of production. The\ntechnological means available then and in the future are and would be\nmore than enough to deal with any increases in population as long as\ncapitalism is overcome. Theories of eternal laws are part of an\nideology that supports the existing mode of production because they\npresent what are contingent laws as necessary, thus creating the\nimpression that the social order cannot be changed. This inhibits the\ninterest in changing society (Lange 1968b, 80\u201381; Marx and\nEngels 1975, 42: 136).\n\nThey also disagreed about the usefulness of Hegel. Lange suspected\nthat Hegelian dialectic, even in the more empiricist and materialist\nform that Marx deployed it, was not very useful for purposes of\nexplanation. He expresses his surprise that at a time in which Hegel\nwas no longer taken seriously in philosophy, Hegelian ideas could be\nso influential in the workers\u2019 movement, in the thought of\nLassalle and Marx (Lange 1894a, 247\u2013249, 260\u2013262). Lange\nhad immense respect for Marx, and thought of him as the leading\neconomist of the time. However, he thought that when it came to\nMarx\u2019s writings, the Hegelian \u201cspeculative form \u2026\ntiresomely intrudes on the content of some parts of the work to the\ndisadvantage of its effectiveness\u201d and undermines the effect of\nthe \u201castounding\u201d display of detailed empirical evidence\n(Lange 1894a, 248). Lange also thought that the emphasis on\nrevolution, and the thought that a revolution could somehow suddenly\nchange the conditions of the working class and the mode of production,\nwas also the result of the negative influence of Hegel. Marx and\nEngels, on the other hand, were committed to some kind of dialectic\nform of explanation. Marx thought that Lange\u2019s basic attitude\ntowards Hegel and dialectic was fundamentally\nmistaken\u2014\u201csimply childish\u201d\u2014and, indeed, showed\nthat Lange \u201cunderstands rien [nothing] about\nHegel\u2019s method and therefore, second, still less about my\ncritical manner of applying it\u201d (Marx and Engels 1975, 43: 528).\nThere is evidence that Lange did understand what was at stake, though,\nas is shown by his clear discussion of idealism in psychology, and in\nthe study of nature in general, in his \u201cSeelenlehre\u201d\n(Lange 1859\u20131875, 144\u201345).\n\nLange had an indirect impact on what was later known as the\nrevisionist debate within socialism. Eduard Bernstein, the father of\nrevisionism, eventually broke with Marxian orthodoxy, and argued that\nachieving socialism did not require a revolution, or at least that\nmuch could be achieved by working within existing democratic political\nstructures. This was in part a result of Bernstein\u2019s developing\nneo-Kantianism (Steger 1992). He claimed that it was primarily\nLange\u2019s work that led him to both Kant and revisionism\n(Vorl\u00e4nder 1900, 47; Bernstein 1892). He suggests that when it\ncomes to articulating a path forward for socialism, \u201cI would\ntranslate \u2018back to Kant\u2019 by \u2018back to\nLange\u2019\u201d (Bernstein 1902, 187\u201388).\n",
