    "main_text": "Mind and Semeiotic\n10. Mind and Semeiotic\n\n\nConnected with Peirce\u2019s insistence on the ubiquity of mind in the\ncosmos is the importance he attached to what he called\n\u201csemeiotic,\u201d the theory of signs in the most general\nsense. Although a few points concerning this subject were made earlier\nin this article, some further discussion is in order. What Peircean\nmeant by \u201csemeiotic\u201d is almost totally different from what\nhas come to be called \u201csemiotics,\u201d and which hails not so\nmuch from Peirce as from Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles\nW. Morris. Even though Peircean semeiotic and semiotics are often\nconfused, it is important not to do so.  Peircean semeiotic derives\nultimately from the theory of signs of Duns Scotus and its later\ndevelopment by John of St. Thomas (John Poinsot).  In Peirce\u2019s theory\nthe sign relation is a triadic relation that is a special species of\nthe genus: the representing relation. Whenever the representing\nrelation has an instance, we find one thing (the \u201cobject\u201d)\nbeing represented by (or: in) another thing (the\n\u201crepresentamen\u201d) and being represented to (or: in) a third\nthing (the \u201cinterpretant.\u201d) Moreover, the object is\nrepresented by the representamen in such a way that the interpretant\nis thereby \u201cdetermined\u201d to be also a representamen of the\nobject to yet another interpretant. That is to say, the interpretant\nstands in the representing relation to the same object represented by\nthe original representamen, and thus the interpretant represents the\nobject (either again or further) to yet another\ninterpretant. Obviously, Peirce\u2019s complicated definition entails that\nwe have an infinite sequence of representamens of an object whenever\nwe have any one representamen of it.\n\n\nThe sign relation is the special species of the representing relation\nthat obtains whenever the first interpretant (and consequently each\nmember of the whole infinite sequence of interpretants) has a status\nthat is mental, i.e. (roughly) is a cognition of a mind. In\nany instance of the sign relation an object is signified by a sign to\na mind. One of Peirce\u2019s central tasks was that of analyzing all\npossible kinds of signs. For this purpose he introduced various\ndistinction among signs, and discussed various ways of classifying\nthem.\n\n\nOne set of distinctions among signs was introduced by Peirce in the\nearly stages of his analysis. The distinctions in this set turn on\nwhether the particular instance of the sign relation is\n\u201cdegenerate\u201d or \u201cnon-degenerate.\u201d The notion\nof \u201cdegeneracy\u201d here is the standard mathematical notion,\nand as applied to sign theory non-degeneracy means simply that the\ntriadic relation cannot be analyzed as a logical conjunction of any\ncombination of dyadic relations and monadic relations. More exactly, a\nparticular instance of the obtaining of the sign relation is\ndegenerate if and only if the fact that a sign\ns means an object o to an interpretant i\ncan be analyzed into a conjunction of facts of the form\nP(s) & Q(o) &\nR(i) & T(s,o) &\nU(o,i) &\nW(i,s) (where not all the conjuncts have to\nbe present). Either an obtaining of the sign relation is\nnon-degenerate, in which case it falls into one class; or it is\ndegenerate in various possible ways (depending on which of the\nconjuncts are omitted and which retained), in which cases it falls\ninto various other classes.  Other distinctions regarding signs were\nintroduced later by Peirce. Some of them will be discussed very\nbriefly in the following section of this article.\n",
