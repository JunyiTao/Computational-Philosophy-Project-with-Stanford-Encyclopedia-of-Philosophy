Some putative varieties of metaphysical explanation\n\nA classic argument for the existence of\nproperties\u2014mind-independent abstract entities, such as\nthose invoked in (1), that can be shared by multiple\nparticulars\u2014is that they are needed in order to metaphysically\nexplain the objective resemblances we find in the world (see the entry\non\n properties, especially \u00a7\u00a73\u20134).\n Both Socrates the philosopher and the bust of him in our seminar room\nare snub-nosed. However (so the argument goes), it cannot be a brute\nfact that this is so; there must be something in virtue of which both\nof these things, separated by space and time, are snub-nosed.\nSpecifically, (so the argument concludes), the fact that these two\nentities share the same property metaphysically explains why they\nresemble each other in this respect. Yet even if objective\nresemblances are, in fact, metaphysically explained by the\nsharing of properties by things that resemble\u2014a big\n\u201cif\u201d, although let us suppose so for illustrative\npurposes\u2014it remains to be said what kind of\nmetaphysical explanation is to be envisaged here. Reflecting on\n(2)\u2013(4) reveals at least three varieties of metaphysical\nexplanation that have been the focus of recent work on the topic and\nin terms of which (1) could be understood.\n\nOne option is to offer (1) as a grounding explanation. There\nis considerable controversy over what grounding is, and (as we shall\nsee) how grounding and explanations are related and how grounding\nexplanations work. We can stay somewhat neutral in saying that they\ntypically work by citing more fundamental facts\u2014in the case of\n(1), a fact about property sharing\u2014that in some sense\nnon-causally \u201cgives rise to\u201d, \u201cproduces\u201d, or\n\u201cgenerates\u201d less fundamental facts\u2014in this case, a\nfact of resemblance among particulars. We say \u201ctypically\u201d,\nsince one may count as grounding explanations those that merely\nprovide information about the grounds of a given fact\n(presumably of some contextually relevant type; see \u00a75.4), rather\nthan by citing its ground directly, as in (1*):\n\n(1*)\nSocrates the philosopher, and this bust of him in our seminar\nroom, are both snub-nosed because they share some property or\nother.\n\n\nAt any rate, to treat (1) and (1*) as grounding explanations would be\nto group them with (2), given a standardly held view, namely that\ninstances of the determinable-determinate relation are paradigmatic\ninstances of grounding.\n\nAlthough recent interest in metaphysical explanation arose from a\nrenewed interest in grounding over the mid to late twentieth century,\ngrounding explanation is arguably not the only form that metaphysical\nexplanation can take. This point was recognized as far back as\nAristotle, who in the Organon and Metaphysics\ndiscusses metaphysical explanations that work by citing facts about\n\u201cthe what it was to be\u201d of some target phenomenon (see,\ne.g., Posterior Analytics 83a7; Topics 141b35; and\nMetaphysics 1003b24, 1006a32, 1006b13), or what we would now\ncall its essence. Like grounding, there is controversy over\nwhat essence is; unlike grounding, much less has been said about how\nessence and explanation are related and how what might be called\nessentialist explanations work. We can again stay somewhat\nneutral in saying that they typically work by citing (or perhaps just\nproviding contextually relevant information about) part of what it is\nto be some phenomenon, in terms of some other phenomenon (e.g., Fine\n2015 and Koslicki 2012).\n\nOffering (1) as an essentialist explanation would be to group it with\n(3), which might suggest rather different truth conditions for (1)\nthan if it were offered as a grounding explanation. Prima\nfacie at least, (3) does not explicitly require that\nSocrates\u2019s having a certain man as a father be a more\nfundamental fact than him being the very individual he is. Moreover,\nit is widely held that the grounds of a fact are modally sufficient\nfor it to obtain, but need not be modally necessary for it, while the\nopposite is true for essence, which would place rather different\nconditions on whether a claim like (2) is true as opposed to a claim\nlike (3). Although a number of recent accounts of grounding analyze it\nin terms of essence (e.g., Correia 2013, Zylstra 2018), or vice versa\n(e.g., deRosset 2013, Gorman 2014), others do neither (e.g., Fine\n2012, 2015). As a provisional matter, we shall treat grounding\nexplanations as distinct from (yet perhaps related to) essentialist\nexplanations and leave open for now whether instances of the one imply\ninstances of the other.\n\nA third option is to instead offer (1) as what we will call a\nreductive explanation, which would be to group (1) with (4)\n(see the entry on\n scientific reduction).\n Like grounding and essence, there is some controversy over what\nreduction is, although somewhat more has been said about how reduction\nand explanation are related and how reductive explanations work than\nin the case of essence. We can again stay somewhat neutral in saying\nthat reductive explanations typically work by \u201canalyzing\u201d\nor \u201cbreaking down\u201d some phenomenon as \u201cnothing more\nthan\u201d another phenomenon. Although a number of recent accounts\nof reduction analyze the notion in terms of grounding, or essence, or\nboth (e.g., Correia 2017; Fine 2001, 2015; Rosen 2015), others do not\n(e.g., Dorr 2016, King 1998). So here too, as a provisional matter we\nshall treat reductive explanation as distinct from (yet perhaps\nrelated to) both grounding and essentialist explanation and leave open\nwhether instances of the one imply instances of the other.\n\nWe are not suggesting that this list of varieties of metaphysical\nexplanation is comprehensive. For instance, consider:\n\n(7)\nSocrates has Sophroniscus as a father because he essentially has\nSophroniscus as a father.\n\n\nAlthough Glazier (2017) calls (7) an instance of essentialist\nexplanation, (7) appears to us to work in a different way than (3).\nUnlike (3), (7) does not attempt to explain what it is for\nSocrates to be the individual he is, or even what it is for\nSocrates to have Sophroniscus as a father. Rather, (7) concerns\nwhy Socrates has Sophroniscus as a father, and works by\nciting a certain fact about the status of this\nrelationship\u2014namely, that it is essential to\nSocrates\u2014which would presumably help to explain why Socrates\nmust be so. Glazier argues that explanations like (7) do not imply\ncorresponding grounding explanations, and thus explanations like (7)\nare not grounding explanations. Yet there is a more general pattern\nhere. Even if one is skeptical of the notion of essence, one might\nattempt to metaphysically explain why Socrates has Sophroniscus as a\nfather in terms of some other status of this fact; for instance, one\nmight appeal to the fact that it falls under a more general \u201claw\nof metaphysics\u201d, or one might simply appeal to the necessity of\nthis fact alone (see Kappes forthcoming).\n\nWe are also not suggesting that one must treat all of these (or other)\nforms of metaphysical explanation as genuine. Nonetheless, they are\nprevalent enough in both classic and contemporary metaphysics that an\naccount of metaphysical explanation that aims to be comprehensive\nought to either accommodate all of them or explain why they are not\ngenuine forms of metaphysical explanation despite initial\nappearances.\n",
