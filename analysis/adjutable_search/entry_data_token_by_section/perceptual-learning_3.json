For this\nreason, laser eye surgery or cataracts removal do not count as\ninstances of perceptual learning. They are not really cases of\nlearning because they do not result from practice or experience. So,\nwhile such cases involve long-term changes in perception, they do not\ncount as cases of perceptual learning.\n\nTo be authentic cases of learning, perceptual changes have to be the\nresult of a learning process. As a contrast case, suppose someone\nundergoes a long-term change in their perception due to a brain\nlesion. Such a change in perception does not result from a learning\nprocess, since the change in perception comes from the lesion, rather\nfrom practice or experience. Because of this, the case does not count\nas an instance of perceptual learning, even though it involves a\nlong-term change in perception.\n",
