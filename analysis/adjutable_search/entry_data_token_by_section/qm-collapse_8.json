    "main_text": "Relativistic Dynamical Reduction Models\n9. Relativistic Dynamical Reduction Models\n\nAs soon as the GRW proposal appeared and attracted the attention of\nJ.S. Bell, it stimulated him to look at it from the point of view of\nrelativity theory. As he stated subsequently:\n\n\nWhen I saw this theory first, I thought that I could blow it out of\nthe water, by showing that it was grossly in violation of\nLorentz invariance. That\u2019s connected with the problem of\n\u2018quantum entanglement\u2019, the EPR paradox. (Bell 1989b: 1)\n\n\nActually, he had already investigated this point by studying the\neffect on the theory of a transformation mimicking a nonrelativistic\napproximation of a Lorentz transformation and he arrived at a\nsurprising conclusion:\n\n\n\u2026 the model is as Lorentz invariant as it could be in its\nnonrelativistic version. It takes away the ground of my fear that any\nexact formulation of quantum mechanics must conflict with fundamental\nLorentz invariance. (Bell 1987: 49)\n\n\nWhat Bell had actually proved by resorting to a two-times formulation\nof the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is that the model violates locality\nby violating outcome independence and not, as deterministic hidden\nvariable theories do, parameter independence.\n\nIndeed, with reference to this point we recall that, as extensively\ndiscussed in the literature (Suppes & Zanotti 1976; van Fraassen\n1982; Jarrett 1984; Shimony 1984; see also the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem),\n Bell\u2019s locality assumption is equivalent to the conjunction of\ntwo other assumptions, viz., in Shimony\u2019s terminology, parameter\nindependence and outcome independence. In view of the experimental\nviolation of Bell\u2019s inequality, one has to give up either one or\nboth these assumptions. The above splitting of the locality\nrequirement into two logically independent conditions is particularly\nuseful in discussing the different status of CSL and deterministic\nhidden variable theories with respect to relativistic requirements.\nActually, as proved by Jarrett himself, when parameter independence is\nviolated, if one had access to the variables which specify completely\nthe state of individual physical systems, one could send\nfaster-than-light signals from one wing of the apparatus to the other.\nMoreover, in Ghirardi and Grassi (1996) it has been proved that it is\nimpossible to build a genuinely relativistically invariant\ntheory which, in its nonrelativistic limit, exhibits parameter\ndependence. Here we use the term genuinely invariant to\ndenote a theory for which there is no (hidden) preferred reference\nframe. On the other hand, if locality is violated only by the\noccurrence of outcome dependence then faster-than-light signaling\ncannot be achieved (Eberhard 1978; Ghirardi, Rimini, & Weber\n1980). Few years after the just mentioned proof by Bell, it has been\nshown in complete generality (Ghirardi, Grassi, Butterfield, &\nFleming 1993) that the GRW and CSL theories, just as standard quantum\nmechanics, exhibit only outcome dependence. This is to some extent\nencouraging and shows that there are no reasons of principle making\nunviable the project of building a relativistically invariant DRM.\n\nLet us be more specific about this crucial problem. P. Pearle was the\nfirst to propose (Pearle 1990) a relativistic generalization of CSL to\na quantum field theory describing a fermion field coupled to a meson\nscalar field enriched with the introduction of stochastic and\nnonlinear terms. A quite detailed discussion of this proposal was\npresented in (Ghirardi, Grassi & Pearle 1990) where it was shown\nthat the theory enjoys of all properties which are necessary in order\nto meet the relativistic constraints. Pearle\u2019s approach requires\nthe precise formulation of the idea of stochastic Lorentz\ninvariance. \n\nIn this model, one considers a fermion field coupled to a meson field\nand puts forward the idea of inducing localizations for the fermions\nthrough their coupling to the mesons with a stochastic dynamical\nreduction mechanism acting on the meson variables. In practice,\nworking in the interaction picture, one considers the standard\nHeisenberg evolution equations for the two coupled fields and a\nTomonaga-Schwinger CSL-type evolution equation with a skew-hermitian\ncoupling to a c-number stochastic potential for the state vector. This\napproach has been systematically investigated by Ghirardi, Grassi, and\nPearle (1990), to which we refer the reader for a detailed discussion.\nHere we stress that, under specific approximations, one obtains in the\nnon-relativistic limit a CSL-type equation inducing spatial\nlocalization. However, due to the white noise nature of the stochastic\npotential, novel renormalization problems arise: the increase per unit\ntime and per unit volume of the energy of the meson field is infinite\ndue to the fact that infinitely many mesons are created. This point\nhas also been lucidly discussed by Bell (1989c [2007]) in the talk he\ndelivered at Trieste on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the\nInternational Centre for Theoretical Physics. This talk appeared under\nthe title The Trieste Lecture of John Stewart Bell. For these\nreasons one cannot consider this as a satisfactory example of a\nrelativistic reduction model.\n\nIn the years following the just mentioned attempts there has been a\nflourishing of researches aimed at getting the desired result. Let us\nbriefly comment on them. As already mentioned, the source of the\ndivergences is the assumption of point interactions between the\nquantum field operators in the dynamical equation for the statevector,\nor, equivalently, the white character of the stochastic noise. Having\nthis aspect in mind, P. Pearle (1989), L. Diosi (1990) and A. Bassi\nand G.C. Ghirardi (2002) reconsidered the problem from the beginning\nby investigating nonrelativistic theories with nonwhite Gaussian\nnoises. The problem turns out to be very difficult from the\nmathematical point of view, but steps forward have been made. In\nrecent years, a precise formulation of the nonwhite generalization\n(Bassi & Ferialdi 2009a and 2009b) of the so-called QMUPL model,\nwhich represents a simplified version of GRW and CSL, has been\nproposed. Moreover, a perturbative approach for the CSL model has been\nworked out (Adler & Bassi 2007, 2008). Further work is\nnecessary. This line of thought is very interesting at the\nnonrelativistic level; however, it is not yet clear whether it will\nlead to a real step forward in the development of relativistic\ntheories of spontaneous collapse. \n\nIn the same spirit, Nicrosini and Rimini (2003) tried to smear out the\npoint interactions without success because, in their approach, a\npreferred reference frame had to be chosen in order to circumvent the\nnonintegrability of the Tomonaga-Schwinger equation \n\nOther interesting and different approaches have been suggested. Among\nthem we mention the one by Dove and Squires (1996) based on discrete\nrather than continuous stochastic processes and those by Dowker and\nHerbauts (2004) and Dawker and Henson (2004) formulated on a discrete\nspace-time.\n\nPrecisely in the same years similar attempts to formulate a\nrelativistic generalization of Bohmian Mechanics were ongoing,\nencountering difficulties. Relevant steps are represented by a paper\n(D\u00fcrr 1999) resorting to a preferred spacetime slicing, by the\ninvestigations of Goldstein and Tumulka (2003) and by other scientists\n(Berndl et al. 1996). However, we must acknowledge that no one of\nthese attempts has led to a fully satisfactory solution of the problem\nof having a theory without observers, like Bohmian mechanics, which is\nperfectly satisfactory from the relativistic point of view, precisely\ndue to the fact that they are not genuinely Lorentz invariant\nin the sense we have made precise before. Mention should be made also\nof the attempt by Horton and Dewdney (2001) to build a\nrelativistically invariant model based on particle trajectories. \n\nLet us come back to the relativistic DRP. Some important changes have\noccurred quite recently. Tumulka (2006a) succeeded in proposing a\nrelativistic version of the GRW theory for N non-interacting\ndistinguishable particles, based on the consideration of a multi-time\nwavefunction whose evolution is governed by Dirac like equations and\nadopts as its Primitive Ontology (see the next section) the one which\nattaches a primary role to the space and time points at which\nspontaneous localizations occur, as originally suggested by Bell\n(1987). To our knowledge this represents the first proposal of a\nrelativistic dynamical reduction mechanism, which satisfies all\nrelativistic requirements. In particular it is free from divergences\nand foliation independent. However, it is formulated only for systems\ncontaining a fixed number of noninteracting fermions.\n\nD. Bedingham (2011) following strictly the original proposal by Pearle\n(1990) of a quantum field theory inducing reductions based on a\nTomonaga- Schwinger equation, has worked out an analogous model which,\nhowever, overcomes the difficulties of the original model. In fact,\nBedingham has circumvented the crucial problems arising from point\ninteractions by (paying the price of) introducing, besides the fields\ncharacterizing the Quantum Field Theories he is interested in, an\nauxiliary relativistic field that amounts to a smearing of the\ninteractions whilst preserving Lorentz invariance and frame\nindependence. Adopting this point of view and taking advantage also of\nthe proposal by Ghirardi (2000) concerning the appropriate way to\ndefine objective properties at any space-time point \\(x\\), he has been\nable to work out a fully satisfactory and consistent relativistic\nscheme for quantum field theories in which reduction processes may\noccur.\n\nTaking once more advantage of the ideas of the paper by Ghirardi\n(2000), various of the just quoted authors (Bedingham, Duerr,\nGhirardi, et al. 2014), have been able to prove that it is possible to\nwork out a relativistic generalization of Collapse models when their\nprimitive ontology is taken to be the one given by the mass density\ninterpretation for the nonrelativistic case we will present in what\nfollows.\n\nIn view of these results and taking into account the interesting\ninvestigations concerning relativistic Bohmian-like theories,the\nconclusions that Tumulka has drawn concerning the status of attempts\nto account for the macro-objectification process from a relativistic\nperspective are well-founded:\n\n\nA somewhat surprising feature of the present situation is that we seem\nto arrive at the following alternative: Bohmian mechanics shows that\none can explain quantum mechanics, exactly and completely, if one is\nwilling to pay with using a preferred slicing of spacetime; our model\nsuggests that one should be able to avoid a preferred slicing of\nspacetime if one is willing to pay with a certain deviation from\nquantum mechanics, (Tumulka 2006a: 842)\n\n\na conclusion that he has rephrased and reinforced in Tumulka\n(2006c: 350):\n\n\nThus, with the presently available models we have the alternative:\neither the conventional understanding of relativity is not right, or\nquantum mechanics is not exact.\n\n\nVery recently, a thorough and illuminating discussion of the important\napproach by Tumulka has been presented by Tim Maudlin (2011) in the\nthird revised edition of his book Quantum Non-Locality and\nRelativity. Tumulka\u2019s position is perfectly consistent with\nthe present ideas concerning the attempts to transform relativistic\nstandard quantum mechanics into an \u2018exact\u2019 theory in the\nsense which has been made precise by J. Bell. Since the only unified,\nmathematically precise and formally consistent formulations of the\nquantum description of natural processes are Bohmian mechanics and\nGRW-like theories, if one chooses the first alternative one has to\naccept the existence of a preferred reference frame, while in the\nsecond case one is not led to such a drastic change of position with\nrespect to relativistic concepts but must accept that the ensuing\ntheory disagrees with the predictions of quantum mechanics and\nacquires the status of a rival theory with respect to it.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the situation is, to some extent, still open\nand requires further investigations, it has to be recognized that the\nefforts which have been spent on such a program have made a better\nunderstanding of some crucial points possible and have thrown light on\nsome important conceptual issues. First, they have led to a completely\ngeneral and rigorous formulation of the concept of stochastic\ninvariance. Second, they have prompted a critical reconsideration,\nbased on the discussion of smeared observables with compact support,\nof the problem of locality at the individual level. This analysis has\nbrought out the necessity of reconsidering the criteria for the\nattribution of objective local properties to physical systems. In\nspecific situations, one cannot attribute any local property to a\nmicrosystem: any attempt to do so gives rise to ambiguities. However,\nwhen dealing with macroscopic systems, the impossibility of\nattributing to them local properties (or, equivalently, the ambiguity\nassociated to such properties) lasts only for time intervals necessary\nfor the dynamical reduction to take place. Moreover, no objective\nproperty corresponding to a local observable, even for microsystems,\ncan emerge as a consequence of a measurement-like event occurring in a\nspace-like separated region: such properties emerge only in the future\nlight cone of the considered macroscopic event. Finally, recent\ninvestigations (Ghirardi & Grassi 1996; Ghirardi 2000) have shown\nthat the very formal structure of the theory is such that it does not\nallow, even conceptually, to establish cause-effect relations between\nspace-like events.\n\nThe conclusion of this section, is that the question of whether a\nrelativistic dynamical reduction program can find a satisfactory\nformulation seems to admit a positive answer.\n\nConnected to collapses and relativity, a paper by Conway and Kochen\n(2006a, 2006b [Other Internet Resources]) is of relevance. The first\nand most important aim of the paper is the derivation of what the\nauthors have called The Free Will Theorem, putting forward\nthe provocative idea that if human beings are free to make their\nchoices about the measurements they will perform on one of a pair of\nfar-away entangled particles, then one must admit that also the\nelementary particles involved in the experiment have free will. A\ndetailed discussion of what the Free Will theorem implies would be\nneeded; for us here the relevant fact is that the authors claim that\ntheir theorem implies, as a byproduct, the impossibility of\nelaborating a relativistically invariant dynamical reduction model. A\nlively debate has arisen. At the end, Goldstein et al. (2010) have\nmade clear why the argument of Conway and Kochen is not pertinent. We\nmay conclude that nothing in principle forbids a perfectly\nsatisfactory relativistic generalization of the GRW theory, and,\nactually, as repeatedly stressed, there are many elements which\nindicate that this is actually feasible.\n",
