    "main_text": "Criticism and Influence || Recent Developments\n6.5 Assessment\nAssessing Kuhn\u2019s significance presents a conundrum.  Unquestionably\nhe was one of the most influential philosophers and historians of\nscience of the twentieth century. His most obvious achievement was to\nhave been a major force in bringing about the final demise of logical\npositivism.  Nonetheless, there is no characteristically Kuhnian\nschool that carries on his positive work.  It is as if he himself\nbrought about a revolution but did not supply the replacement\nparadigm.  For a period in the 1960s and 1970s it looked as if there\nwas a Kuhnian paradigm \u2018historical philosophy of science\u2019,\nflourishing especially in newly formed departments of history and\nphilosophy of science.  But as far as the history of science and\nscience studies more generally are concerned, Kuhn repudiated at least\nthe more radical developments made in his name.  Indeed part of Kuhn\u2019s\nfame must be due to the fact that both his supporters and his\ndetractors took his work to be more revolutionary (anti-rationalist,\nrelativist) than it really was.\nTurning to the philosophy of science, it was clear by the end of\nthe 1980s that the centreground was now occupied by a new realism, one\nthat took on board lessons from general philosophy of language and\nepistemology, in particular referentialist semantics and a belief in\nthe possibility of objective knowledge and justification.  There is\nsome irony therefore in the fact that it was the demise of logical\npositivism/empiricism that led to the rebirth of scientific realism\nalong with causal and externalist semantics and epistemology,\npositions that Kuhn rejected.\nOne way of understanding this outcome is to see that Kuhn\u2019s\nrelationship on the one hand to positivism and on the other hand to\nrealism places him in an interesting position. Kuhn\u2019s thesis of the\ntheory-dependence of observation parallels related claims by\nrealists. In the hands of realists the thesis is taken to undermine\nthe theory-observation dichotomy that permitted positivists to take an\nanti-realist attitude to theories. In the hands of Kuhn however, the\nthesis is taken, in effect, to extend anti-realism from theories to\nobservation also.  This in turn fuels the thesis of\nincommensurability. The fact that incommensurability is founded upon a\nresponse to positivism diametrically opposed to the realist response\nexplains why much of Kuhn\u2019s later philosophical work, which developed\nthe incommensurability thesis, has had little impact on the majority\nof philosophers of science.\nThe explanation of scientific development in terms of paradigms was\nnot only novel but radical too, insofar as it gives a naturalistic\nexplanation of belief-change. Naturalism was not in the early 1960s\nthe familiar part of philosophical landscape that it has subsequently\nbecome.  Kuhn\u2019s explanation contrasted with explanations in terms of\nrules of method (or confirmation, falsification etc.) that most\nphilosophers of science took to be constitutive of\nrationality. Furthermore, the relevant disciplines (psychology,\ncognitive science, artificial intelligence) were not then advanced\nenough to to support Kuhn\u2019s contentions concerning paradigms, or those\ndisciplines were antithetical to Kuhn\u2019s views (in the case of\nclassical AI). Now that naturalism has become an accepted component of\nphilosophy, there has recently been interest in reassessing Kuhn\u2019s\nwork in the light of developments in the relevant sciences, many of\nwhich provide corroboration for Kuhn\u2019s claim that science is driven by\nrelations of perceived similarity and analogy. It may yet be that a\ncharacteristically Kuhnian thesis will play a prominent part in our\nunderstanding of science.\n",
