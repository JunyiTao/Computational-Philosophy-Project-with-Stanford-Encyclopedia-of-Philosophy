    "main_text": "Philo and Philosophical Schools || Stoicism\n3.2 Stoicism\n\nPhilo was probably the non-Stoic thinker who most frequently drew upon\nboth Stoic themes and vocabulary. Many scholars have noticed the\nstrong influence of Stoicism on Philo, and he is described frequently\nas a Platonizing Stoic. However, matters are a bit more complex. Given\nhis Jewish faith, he couldn\u2019t refuse the Stoic conception of a\nperfectly organized world in which mankind had a privileged status\namong all other living creatures. One can add that the specific\nvocabulary of Stoicism had become a kind of lingua franca of\nintellectual discourse, used even by those who had no special\naffinity with the Stoics. At the same time, Philo was aware that the\nStoic refusal of transcendence created an unbridgeable gap between his\nown spiritual identity and Stoicism. There is a huge debt of Philo\ntowards Stoicism, but at the same time, he could claim to have repaid\nthis debt by bringing Stoicism in the direction of truth. Philo never\nsays exactly the same things as the Stoics. Despite their apparent\nsimilarities, there always remains a difference\u2013sometimes barely\nperceptible, but always highly significant\u2014between his doctrines\nand those of the Stoics. These differences can be distributed into\nfour categories:\n\n\n\nDoctrinal differences: for the Stoics, logos was\nequally reason (individual and universal), nature, and God, while for\nPhilo, logos is not ultimate reality but merely what we can\nsee and understand of God, who is Himself very far from human\ncomprehension (Calabi 2008). In Stoicism, logos is God; in\nPhilo it corresponds to his specific doctrine of the\ndunameis, the powers of God who created the world and governs\nit.\n\n\nAn inverse relation between the individual and the universal:\nfor Stoic philosophers, natural law is the logos in its\nfunction of commanding what must be done or avoided. No particular\nhuman law corresponds with the natural law, though Cicero tried to\ndemonstrate that Roman religious law could coincide at least partly\nwith the law of nature. In Philo\u2019s thought, the Torah is\ndescribed as containing many elements of natural law, and its claims\nto universality were concretized in the Greek of the\nSeptuagint.\n\n\nThe refusal of essential Stoic concepts: Philo only uses the\nword sunkatathesis twice in his entire corpus, a key term\ndefining the human ability to accept or refuse information given by\nthe senses and the capacity to transform decisions into action. He\nuses sometimes oikei\u00f4sis, another Stoic keyword, but\nnever with the meaning the Stoics lent to this concept. In brief,\nStoic oikei\u00f4sis expresses the idea that Nature gives to\nevery living being from birth an indication of what its supreme\npurpose in life will be. In the case of mankind, things are a little\nmore complex. The first impulse is, as in the case of all animals, the\nimpulse to survive, but after this comes the impulse toward a rational\nlife, a privilege that human beings alone share with God. All this was\nunacceptable to Philo, both the idea that human beings could at their\nbirth be submitted to the same law as animals, and the definition of\ntelos, the supreme human good (Besnier 1999), as the capacity\nof making choices in accordance with nature. It must be added that\nPhilo only uses the term \u201cprokopt\u00f4n\u201d (a progressing in ethics)\nas an exegetic tool. This absence can be interpreted as an argument\nagainst the thesis of a late conversion to stoIcism (L\u00e9vy 2021\nvs Niehoff 2018).\n\n\nSubstitutions and additions: It has been correctly observed\nthat psychology, and especially psychology of the passions (Weisser\n2021), is one of the fields in which Stoic influence is most visible\nin the Philonian corpus (Reydams Schils 2008). It is perfectly true\nthat he employs many Stoic elements in his psychological commentaries,\nbut in contrast to Chrysippean monistic doctrine, Philo never insists\nthat the soul could be exclusively rational. Philo\u2019s own stance\nis to invoke a Platonic dualism when arguing that the soul is exiled\nin the body and consequently in the world, and invoke Stoic\npsychological descriptions when describing the multiplicity of mental\nactivities. Because he used these two levels\u2014one metaphysical\nand ethical, the other descriptive and functionalist\u2014he could\ngive the impression of having avoided the contradictions between the\ntwo doctrines.\n\n",
