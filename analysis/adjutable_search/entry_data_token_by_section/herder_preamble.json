    "main_text": "\n\nJohann Gottfried von Herder (1744\u20131803) is a philosopher of the\nfirst importance. This judgment largely turns on the intrinsic quality\nof his ideas (of which this article will try to give some impression).\nBut another aspect of it is his intellectual influence. This has been\nimmense both within philosophy and beyond it (much greater than is\nusually realized). For example, Hegel\u2019s philosophy turns out to\nbe largely a sort of elaborate systematic development of\nHerder\u2019s ideas (especially concerning language, the mind,\nhistory, and God); so too does Schleiermacher\u2019s (concerning\nlanguage, interpretation, translation, the mind, art, and God);\nNietzsche is deeply influenced by Herder as well (concerning language,\nthe mind, history, and values); so too is Dilthey (especially\nconcerning history); even John Stuart Mill has important debts to\nHerder (in political philosophy); and beyond philosophy, Goethe was\ntransformed from being merely a clever but rather conventional poet\ninto the great artist he eventually became largely through the early\nimpact on him of Herder\u2019s ideas.\n\nIndeed, Herder virtually established whole disciplines that\nwe now take for granted. For example, it was mainly Herder (not, as\nhas often been claimed, Hamann) who established fundamental ideas\nconcerning an intimate dependence of thought on language that underpin\nmodern philosophy of language. It was Herder who, through those same\nideas, his recognition of deep variations in thought and language\nacross historical periods and cultures, his perception of the\nfundamental role of grammar in language and of grammar\u2019s deep\nvariation between languages, his empirical approach to languages, and\nin other ways, inspired Friedrich Schlegel, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and\nothers to found modern linguistics. It was Herder who developed modern\ninterpretation-theory, or \u201chermeneutics\u201d, in ways that\nwould subsequently be taken over by Schleiermacher and then more\nsystematically formulated by the latter\u2019s pupil August Boeckh.\nIt was Herder who, by doing so, also contributed to establishing the\nmethodological foundations of nineteenth-century German classical\nscholarship (which rested on the Schleiermacher-Boeckh methodology),\nand thereby of modern classical scholarship generally. It was Herder\nwho did more than anyone else to establish the general conception and\nthe interpretive methodology of our modern discipline of anthropology.\nFinally, Herder also made vital contributions to the progress of\nmodern biblical scholarship.\n",
