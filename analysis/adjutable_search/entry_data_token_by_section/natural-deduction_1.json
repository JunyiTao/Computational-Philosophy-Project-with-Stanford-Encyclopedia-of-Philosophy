    "main_text": "Natural Deduction Systems\n2. Natural Deduction Systems\n\nNatural deduction allows especially perspicuous comparison of\nclassical with intuitionistic logic, as formulations of the two logics\ncan be given with only small changes to the set of rules. Gentzen,\nJa\u015bkowski, and Fitch all noted this in their early\n publications.[3]\n\nIn this section we briefly describe both the original systems of\n Gentzen[4]\n and Ja\u015bkowski as well as a very few of the influential systems\nthat have been introduced in the more recent heyday of elementary\nlogic textbooks.\n",
