    "main_text": "Gibbsian Statistical Mechanics (GSM) || The Epistemic Account\n6.6 The Epistemic Account\n\nThe epistemic account urges a radical reconceptualization of SM. The\naccount goes back to Tolman (1938 [1979]) and has been brought to\nprominence by Jaynes in a string of publications between 1955 and\n1980, most of which are gathered in Jaynes (1983). On this approach,\nSM is about our knowledge of the world and not about the\nworld itself, and the probability distributions in GSM represents our\nstate of knowledge about a system and not some matter of fact. The\ncentre piece of this interpretation is the fact that the Gibbs entropy\nis formally identical to the Shannon entropy in information theory,\nwhich is a measure for the lack of information about a system: the\nhigher the entropy, the less we know (for a discussion of the Shannon\nentropy see the entry on\n information, \u00a74.2).\n The Gibbs entropy can therefore be seen as quantifying our lack of\ninformation about a system. This has the advantage that ensembles are\nno longer needed in the statement of GSM. On the epistemic account,\nthere is only one system, the one on which we are performing our\nexperiments, and \\(\\rho\\) describes what we know about it. This also\noffers a natural criterion for identifying equilibrium distributions:\nthey are the distributions with the highest entropy consistent with\nthe external constraints on the system because such distributions are\nthe least committal distributions. This explains why we expect\nequilibrium to be associated with maximum entropy. This is known as\nJaynes\u2019 maximum entropy principle (MEP).\n\nMEP has been discussed controversially, and, to date, there is no\nconsensus on its significance, or even cogency. For discussions see,\nfor instance, Denbigh and Denbigh (1985), Howson and Urbach (2006),\nLavis (1977), Lavis and Milligan (1985), Seidenfeld (1986), Shimony\n(1985), Uffink (1995, 1996a), and Williamson (2010). The epistemic\napproach also assumes that experimental outcomes correspond to phase\naverages, but as we have seen, this is a problematic assumption\n (\u00a76.1).\n A further concern is that the system\u2019s own dynamics plays no\nrole in the epistemic approach. This is problematic because if the\ndynamics has invariant quantities, a system cannot access certain\nparts of the state space even though \\(\\rho\\) may assign a non-zero\nprobability to it (Sklar 1993: 193\u20134).\n\nThe epistemic account\u2019s explanation of the approach to\nequilibrium relies on making repeated measurements and\nconditionalizing on each measurement result; for a discussion see\nSklar (1993: 255\u2013257). This successfully gets around the problem\nthat the Gibbs entropy is constant, because the value assignments now\ndepend not only on the system\u2019s internal dynamics, but also on\nthe action of an experimenter. The problem with this solution is that\ndepending on how exactly the calculations are done, either the entropy\nincrease fails to be monotonic (indeed entropy decreases are possible)\nor the entropy curve will become dependent on the sequence of instants\nof time chosen to carry out measurements (Lavis & Milligan\n1985).\n\nHowever, the most fundamental worry about the epistemic approach is\nthat it fails to realise the fundamental aim of SM, namely to explain\nhow and why processes in nature take place because these processes\ncannot possibly depend on what we know about them. Surely, so the\nargument goes, the boiling of kettles or the spreading of gases has\nsomething to do with how the molecules constituting these systems\nbehave and not with what we happen (or fail) to know about them\n(Redhead 1995; Albert 2000; Loewer 2001). For further discussions of\nthe epistemic approach see Anta (forthcoming-a, forthcoming-b),\nShenker (2020), and Uffink (2011).\n",
