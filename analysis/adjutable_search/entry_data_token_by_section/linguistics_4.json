    "main_text": "Three Approaches to Linguistic Theorizing: Externalism, Emergentism, and Essentialism || Comparing the three approaches\n1.4 Comparing the three approaches\n\nThe discussion so far has been at a rather high level of abstraction.\nIt may be useful to contrast the three tendencies by looking at how\nthey each would analyze a particular linguistic phenomenon. We have\nselected the syntax of double-object clauses like\nHand the guard your pass (also called\nditransitive clauses), in which the verb is\nimmediately followed by a sequence of two noun phrases, the first\ntypically denoting a recipient and the second something transferred.\nFor many such clauses there is an alternative way of expressing\nroughly the same thing: for Hand the guard your pass there is\nthe alternative Hand your pass to the guard, in which the\nverb is followed by a single object noun phrase and the recipient is\nexpressed after that by a preposition phrase with to. We will\ncall these recipient-PP clauses.\n1.4.1 A typical Essentialist analysis\n\nLarson (1988) offers a generative Essentialist approach to the syntax\nof double-object clauses. In order to provide even a rough outline of\nhis proposals, it will be very useful to be able to use tree\ndiagrams of syntactic structure. A tree is a mathematical\nobject consisting of a set of points called nodes\nbetween which certain relations hold. The nodes correspond to\nsyntactic units; left-right order on the page corresponds to temporal\norder of utterance between them; and upward connecting lines represent\nthe relation \u2018is an immediate subpart of\u2019. Nodes are\nlabeled to show categories of phrases and words, such as noun phrase\n(NP); preposition phrase (PP); and verb phrase (VP). When the internal\nstructure of some subpart of a tree is basically unimportant to the\ntopic under discussion, it is customary to mask that part with an\nempty triangle. Consider a simple example: an active transitive clause\nlike (Ai) and its passive equivalent (Aii).\n\n(A)\n\n\ni.\nThe guard checked my pass. [active clause]\nii.\nMy pass was checked by the guard. [passive\nclause]\n \n\n\nA tree structure for (Ai) is shown in (T1).\n\n\n\n\nIn analyses of the sort Larson exemplifies, the structure of an\nexpression is given by a derivation, which consists\nof a sequence of successively modified trees. Larson calls the\nearliest ones underlying structures. The last (and\nleast abstract) in the derivation is the surface structure, which\ncaptures properties relevant to the way the expression is written and\npronounced. The underlying structures are posited in order to better\nidentify syntactic generalizations. They are related to surface\nstructures by a series of operations called\ntransformations (which generative Essentialists\ntypically regard as mentally real operations of the human language\nfaculty).\n\nOne of the fundamental operations that a transformation can effect is\nmovement, which involves shifting a part of the\nsyntactic structure of a tree to another location within it. For\nexample, it is often claimed that passive clauses have very much the\nsame kinds of underlying structures as the synonymous active clauses,\nand thus a passive clause like (Aii) would have an underlying\nstructure much like (T1). A movement transformation would shift\nthe guard toward the end of the clause (and add by),\nand another would shift my pass into the position before the\nverb. In other words, passive clauses look much more like their active\ncounterparts in underlying structure.\n\nIn a similar way, Larson proposes that a double-object clause like\n(B.ii) has the same underlying structure as (B.i).\n\n(B)\n\n\ni.\nI showed my pass to the guard. [recipient-PP]\nii.\nI showed the guard my pass. [double object]\n \n\n\nMoreover, he proposes that the transformational operation of deriving\nthe surface structure of (B.ii) from the underlying structure of (B.i)\nis essentially the same as the one that derives the surface structure\nof (A.ii) from the underlying structure of (A.i).\n\nLarson adopts many assumptions from Chomsky (1981) and subsequent\nwork. One is that all NPs have to be assigned Case in\nthe course of a derivation. (Case is an abstract syntactic property,\nonly indirectly related to the morphological case forms displayed by\nnominative, accusative, and genitive pronouns. Objective Case is\nassumed to be assigned to any NP in direct object position, e.g.,\nmy pass in (T1), and Nominative Case is assigned to an NP in\nthe subject position of a tensed clause, e.g., the guard in\n(T1).)\n\nHe also makes two specific assumptions about the derivation of passive\nclauses. First, Case assignment to the position immediately after the\nverb is \u201csuppressed\u201d, which entails that the NP there will\nnot get Case unless it moves to some other position. (The subject\nposition is the obvious one, because there it will receive Nominative\nCase.) Second, there is an unusual assignment of semantic role to NPs:\ninstead of the subject NP being identified as the agent of the action\nthe clause describes, that role is assigned to an adjunct at the end\nof the VP (the by-phrase in (A.ii); an adjunct is a\nconstituent with an optional modifying role in its clause rather than\na grammatically obligatory one like subject or object).\n\nLarson proposes that both of these points about passive clauses have\nanalogs in the structure of double-object VPs. First, Case assignment\nto the position immediately after the verb is suppressed; and since\nLarson takes the preposition to to be the marker of Case, this means\nin effect that to disappears. This entails that the NP after\nto will not get Case unless it moves to some other position.\nSecond, there is an unusual assignment of semantic role to NPs:\ninstead of the direct object NP being identified as the entity\naffected by the action the clause describes, that role is assigned to\nan adjunct at the end of the VP.\n\nLarson makes some innovative assumptions about VPs. First, he proposes\nthat in the underlying structure of a double-object clause the\ndirect object precedes the verb, the tree diagram being (T2).\n\n\n\n\nThis does not match the surface order of words (showed my pass to\nthe guard), but it is not intended to: it is an underlying\nstructure. A transformation will move the verb to the left of my\npass to produce the surface order seen in (B.i).\n\nSecond, he assumes that there are two nodes labeled VP in a\ndouble-object clause, and two more labeled V\u2032, though there is\nonly one word of the verb (V) category. (Only the smaller VP and\nV\u2032 are shown in the partial structure (T2).)\n\nWhat is important here is that (T2) is the basis for the double-object\nsurface structure as well. To produce that, the preposition\nto is erased and an additional NP position (for my\npass) is attached to the V\u2032, thus:\n\n\n\n\nThe additional NP is assigned the affected-entity semantic role. The\nother NP (the guard) does not yet have Case; but Larson\nassumes that it moves into the NP position before the verb. The result\nis shown in (T4), where \u2018e\u2019 marks the empty\nstring left where some words have been moved away:\n\n\n\n\nLarson assumes that in this position the guard can receive\nCase. What remains is for the verb to move into a higher V position\nfurther to its left, to obtain the surface order:\n\n\n\n\nThe complete sequence of transformations is taken to give a deep\ntheoretical explanation of many properties of (B.i) and (B.ii),\nincluding such things as what could be substituted for the two NPs,\nand the fact there is at least rough truth-conditional equivalence\nbetween the two clauses.\n\nThe reader with no previous experience of generative linguistics will\nhave many questions about the foregoing sketch (e.g., whether it is\nreally necessary to have the guard after showed in\n(T3), then the opposite order in (T4), and finally the same order\nagain in (T5)). We cannot hope to answer such questions here;\nLarson\u2019s paper is extremely rich in further assumptions, links\nto the previous literature, and additional classes of data that he\naims to explain. But the foregoing should suffice to convey some of\nthe flavor of the analysis.\n\nThe key point to note is that Essentialists seek underlying symmetries\nand parallels whose operation is not manifest in the data of language\nuse. For Essentialists, there is positive explanatory virtue in\nhypothesizing abstract structures that are very far from being\ninferrable from performance; and the posited operations on those\nstructures are justified in terms of elegance and formal parallelism\nwith other analyses, not through observation of language use in\ncommunicative situations.\n1.4.2 A typical Emergentist analysis\n\nMany Emergentists are favorably disposed toward the kind of\nconstruction grammar expounded in Goldberg (1995). We\nwill use her work as an exemplar of the Emergentist approach. The\nfirst thing to note is that Goldberg does not take double-object\nclauses like (B.ii) to be derived alternants of recipient-PP\nstructures like (B.i), the way Larson does. So she is not looking for\na regular syntactic operation that can relate their derivations;\nindeed, she does not posit derivations at all. She is interested in\nexplaining correlations between syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic\naspects of clauses; for example, she asks this question:\n\nHow are the semantics of independent constructions related such that\nthe classes of verbs associated with one overlap with the classes of\nverbs associated with another? (Goldberg 1995: 89)\n\n\nThus she aims to explain why some verbs occur in both the\ndouble-object and recipient-PP kinds of expression and some do\nnot.\n\nThe fundamental notion in Goldberg\u2019s linguistic theory is that\nof a construction. A construction can be defined very\nroughly as a way of structurally composing words or phrases\u2014a\nsort of template\u2014for expressing a certain class of meanings.\nLike Emergentists in general, Goldberg regards linguistic theory as\ncontinuous with a certain part of general cognitive psychological\ntheory; linguistics emerges from this more general theory, and\nlinguistic matters are rarely fully separate from cognitive matters.\nSo a construction for Goldberg has a mental reality: it corresponds to\na generalized concept or scenario expressible in a language, annotated\nwith a guide to the linguistic structure of the expression.\n\nMany words will be trivial examples of constructions: a single concept\npaired with a way of pronouncing and some details about grammatical\nrestrictions (category, inflectional class, etc.); but constructions\ncan be much more abstract and internally complex. The double-object\nconstruction, which Goldberg calls the Ditransitive Construction, is a\nmoderately abstract and complex one; she diagrams it thus (p. 50):\n\n\n\n\nThis expresses a set of constraints on how to use English to\ncommunicate the idea of a particular kind of scenario. The scenario\ninvolves a ternary relation CAUSE-RECEIVE holding between an agent\n(agt), a recipient (rec), and a\npatient (pat). PRED is a variable that is filled by\nthe meaning of a particular verb when it is employed in this\nconstruction.\n\nThe solid vertical lines downward from agt and\npat indicate that for any verb integrated into this\nconstruction it is required that its subject NP should express the\nagent participant, and the direct object (OBJ2) should\nexpress the patient participant. The dashed vertical line downward\nfrom rec signals that the first object (OBJ) may express the recipient\nbut it does not have to\u2014the necessity of there being a recipient\nis a property of the construction itself, and not every verb demands\nthat it be made explicit who the recipient is. But if there are two\nobjects, the first is obligatorily associated with the recipient role:\nWe sent the builder a carpenter can only express a claim\nabout the sending of a carpenter over to the builder, never the\nsending of the builder over to where a carpenter is.\n\nWhen a particular verb is used in this construction, it may have\nobligatory accompanying NPs denoting what Goldberg calls\n\u201cprofiled participants\u201d so that the match between the\nparticipant roles (agt, rec,\npat) is one-to-one, as with the verb hand.\nWhen this verb is used, the agent (\u2018hander\u2019), recipient\n(\u2018handee\u2019), and item transferred (\u2018handed\u2019)\nmust all be made explicit. Goldberg gives the following diagram of the\n\u201ccomposite structure\u201d that results when hand is\nused in the construction:\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this requirement of explicit presence, Hand him your\npass is grammatical, but *Hand him is not,\nand neither is *Hand your pass. The verb\nsend, on the other hand, illustrates the optional syntactic\nexpression of the recipient role: we can say Send a text\nmessage, which is understood to involve some recipient but does\nnot make the recipient explicit.\n\nThe R notation relates to the fact that particular verbs may express\neither an instance of causing someone to receive something,\nas with hand, or a means of causing someone to\nreceive something, as with kick: what Joe kicked Bill the\nball means is that Joe caused Bill to receive the ball by means\nof a kicking action.\n\nGoldberg\u2019s discussion covers many subtle ways in which the\nscenario communicated affects whether the use of a construction is\ngrammatical and appropriate. For example, there is something odd about\n?Joe kicked Bill the ball he was trying to kick to\nSam: the Ditransitive Construction seems best suited to cases of\nvolitional transfer (rather than transfer as an unexpected side effect\nof a blunder). However, an exception is provided by a class of cases\nin which the transfer is not of a physical object but is only\nmetaphorical: That guy gives me the creeps does not imply any\nvolitional transfer of a physical object.\n\nMetaphorical cases are distinguished from physical transfers in other\nways as well. Goldberg notes sentences like The music lent the\nevent a festive air, where the music is subject of the\nverb lend despite the fact that music cannot literally lend anything\nto anyone.\n\nGoldberg discusses many topics such as metaphorical extension,\nshading, metonymy, cutting, role merging, and also presents various\ngeneral principles linking meanings and constructions. One of these\nprinciples, the No Synonymy Principle, says that no two syntactically\ndistinct constructions can be both semantically and pragmatically\nsynonymous. It might seem that if any two sentences are synonymous,\npairs like this are:\n\n(C)\n\n\ni.\nShe gave her husband an iPod. [double object]\nii.\nShe gave an iPod to her husband. [recipient-PP]\n \n\n\nYet the two constructions cannot be fully synonymous, both\nsemantically and pragmatically, if the No Synonymy Principle is\ncorrect. And to support the principle, Goldberg notes purported\ncontrasts such as this:\n\n(D)\n\n\ni.\nShe gave her husband a new interest in music. [double\nobject]\nii.\n?She gave a new interest in music to her\nhusband. [recipient-PP]\n \n\n\nThere is a causation-as-transfer metaphor here, and it seems to be\ncompatible with the double object construction but not with the\nrecipient-PP. So (in Goldberg\u2019s view) the two are not fully\nsynonymous.\n\nIt is no part of our aim here to provide a full account of the content\nof Goldberg\u2019s discussion of double-object clauses. But what we\nwant to highlight is that the focus is not on finding abstract\nelements or operations of a purely syntactic nature that are\ncandidates for being essential properties of language per se. The\nfocus for Emergentists is nearly always on the ways in which meaning\nis conveyed, the scenarios that particular constructions are used to\ncommunicate, and the aspects of language that connect up with\npsychological topics like cognition, perception, and\nconceptualization.\n1.4.3 A typical Externalist analysis\n\nOne kind of work that is representative of the Externalist tendency is\nnicely illustrated by Bresnan et al. (2007) and Bresnan and Ford\n(2010). Bresnan and her colleagues defend the use of\ncorpora\u2014bodies of attested written and spoken texts. One of\ntheir findings is that a number of types of expressions that linguists\nhave often taken to be ungrammatical do in fact turn up in actual use.\nEssentialists and Emergentists alike have often, purely on the basis\nof intuition, asserted that sentences like John gave Mary a\nkiss are grammatical but sentences like John gave a kiss to\nMary are no, as we see above with Goldberg\u2019s (D)(ii).\nBresnan and her colleagues find numerous occurrences of the latter\nsort on the World Wide Web, and conclude that they are not\nungrammatical or even unacceptable, but merely dispreferred.\n\nBresnan and colleagues used a three-million-word collection of\nrecorded and transcribed spontaneous telephone conversations known as\nthe Switchboard corpus to study the double-object and recipient-PP\nconstructions. They first annotated the utterances with indications of\na number of factors that they thought might influence the choice\nbetween the double-object and recipient-PP constructions:\n\nDiscourse accessibility of NPs: does a particular NP refer to\nsomething already mentioned, or to something new to the\ndiscourse?\nRelative lengths of NPs: what is the difference in number of words\nbetween the recipient NP and the transferred-item NP?\nDefiniteness: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs definite\nlike the bishop or indefinite like some members\nAnimacy: do the recipient and transferred-item NPs denote animate\nbeings or inanimate things?\nPronominality: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs\npronouns?\nNumber: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs singular or\nplural?\nperson: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs first-person or\nsecond-person pronouns, or third person?\n\n\nThey also coded the verb meanings by assigning them to half a dozen\nsemantic categories:\n\nAbstract senses (give it some thought);\nTransfer of possession (give him an armband);\nFuture transfer of possession (I owe you a dollar);\nPrevention of possession (They denied me my rights);\nCommunication verb sense (tell me your name).\n\n\nThey then constructed a statistical model of the corpus: a\nmathematical formula expressing, for each combination of the factors\nlisted above, the ratio of the probabilities of the double object and\nthe recipient-PP. (To be precise, they used the natural logarithm of\nthe ratio of p to 1 \u2212 p, where p is\nthe probability of a double-object or recipient-PP in the corpus being\nof the double-object form.) They then used logistic regression to\npredict the probability of fit to the data.\n\nTo determine how well the model generalized to unseen data, they\ndivided the data randomly 100 times into a training set and a testing\nset, fit the model parameters on each training set, and scored its\npredictions on the unseen testing set. The average percent of correct\npredictions on unseen data was 92%. All components of the model except\nnumber of the recipient NP made a statistically significant\ndifference\u2014almost all at the 0.001 level.\n\nWhat this means is that knowing only the presence or absence of the\nsort of factors listed above they were reliably able to predict\nwhether double-object or recipient-PP structures would be used in a\ngiven context, with a 92% score accuracy rate.\n\nThe implication is that the two kinds of structure are not\ninterchangeable: they are reliably differentiated by the presence of\nother factors in the texts in which they occur.\n\nThey then took the model they had generated for the telephone speech\ndata and applied it to a corpus of written material: the Wall\nStreet Journal corpus (WSJ), a collection of 1987\u20139\nnewspaper copy, only roughly edited. The main relevant difference with\nwritten language is that the language producer has more opportunity to\nreflect thoughtfully on how they are going to phrase things. It was\nreasonable to think that a model based on speech data might not\ntransfer well. But instead the model had 93.5% accuracy. The authors\nconclude is that \u201cthe model for spoken English transfers\nbeautifully to written\u201d. The main difference between the corpora\nwas found to be a slightly higher probability of the recipient-PP\nstructure in written English.\n\nIn a very thorough subsequent study, Bresnan and Ford (2010) show that\nthe results also correlate with native speakers\u2019 metalinguistic\njudgments of naturalness for sentence structures, and with lexical\ndecision latencies (speed of deciding whether the words in a text were\ngenuine English words or not), and with a sentence completion task\n(choosing the most natural of a list of possible completions of a\npartial sentence). The results of these experiments confirmed that\ntheir model predicted participants\u2019 performance.\n\nAmong the things to note about this work is that it was all done on\ndirectly recorded performance data: transcripts of people speaking to\neach other spontaneously on the phone in the case of the Switchboard\ncorpus, stories as written by newspaper journalists in the case of\nWSJ, measured responses of volunteer subjects in a laboratory in the\ncase of the psycholinguistic experiments of Bresnan and Ford (2010).\nThe focus is on identifying the factors in linguistic performance that\npermit accurate prediction of future performance, and the methods of\ninvestigation have a replicability and checkability that is familiar\nin the natural sciences.\n\nHowever, we should make it clear that the work is not some kind of\nclose-to-the-ground collecting and classifying of instances. The\nmodels that Bresnan and her colleagues develop are sophisticated\nmathematical abstractions, very far removed from the records of\nutterance tokens. They claim that these models \u201callow linguistic\ntheory to solve more difficult problems than it has in the past, and\nto build convergent projects with psychology, computer science, and\nallied fields of cognitive science\u201d (Bresnan et al. 2007:\n69).\n1.4.4 Conclusion\n\nIt is important to see that the contrast we have drawn here is not\njust between three pieces of work that chose to look at different\naspects of the phenomena associated with double-object sentences. It\nis true that Larson focuses more on details of tree structure,\nGoldberg more on subtle differences in meaning, and Bresnan et al. on\nfrequencies of occurrence. But that is not what we are pointing to.\nWhat we want to stress is that we are illustrating three different\nbroad approaches to language that regard different facts as likely to\nbe relevant, and make different assumptions about what needs to be\naccounted for, and what might count as an explanation.\n\nLarson looks at contrasts between different kinds of clause with\ndifferent meanings and see evidence of abstract operations affecting\nsubtle details of tree structure, and parallelism between derivational\noperations formerly thought distinct.\n\nGoldberg looks at the same facts and sees evidence not for anything to\ndo with derivations but for the reality of specific\nconstructions\u2014roughly, packets of syntactic, semantic, and\npragmatic information tied together by constraints.\n\nBresnan and her colleagues see evidence that readily observable facts\nabout speaker behavior and frequency of word sequences correlate\nclosely with certain lexical, syntactic, and semantic properties of\nwords.\n\nNothing precludes defenders of any of the three approaches from paying\nattention to any of the phenomena that the other approaches attend to.\nThere is ample opportunity for linguists to mix aspects of the three\napproaches in particular projects. But in broad outline there are\nthree different tendencies exhibited here, with stereotypical views\nand assumptions roughly as we laid them out in Table 1.\n",
