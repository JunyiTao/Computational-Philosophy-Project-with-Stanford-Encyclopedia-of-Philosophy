This idea has played\nsome role in the debate over the embedding problem insofar as some of\nthe proposals have been inconsistent with substantive positions taken\nin the debate about the possibility of moral dilemmas (Gibbard 1990,\n88; Shea 2024; van Roojen 1996, 324). But even aside from that\nparticular issue, the desideratum can make a good deal of work for the\nnon-cognitivist because of the variety of kinds of moral theory and\nthe variety of differing but allegedly consistent judgments proposed\nby theorists.\n\nAs a simple example, non-cognitivists need to be able to distinguish\nis that judgements of rightness from judgments of goodness. According\nto standard non-consequentialist theories, rightness and goodness can\ncome apart. In other words, a right action can be such as not to\nproduce the most goodness. Of course consequentialists deny this, and\nnon-consequentialists who use agent-relative values to specify the\nrightness of actions can also deny that rightness and goodness come\napart in this way (Broome 1991, chapter 1). But even if they are\nincorrect as a matter of substantive moral philosophy, it would seem\nthat competent moral judges can hold views of the sort described\nwithout contradiction. Non-cognitivists would like to be able to give\nan explanation of this consistent with their analyses. Hence they need\na way of distinguishing the psychological states involved in making\nthe two sorts of judgment.\n\nA salient strategy for distinguishing rightness and goodness\njudgements might be to claim that they attach to different things\n\u2013 rightness to actions and goodness to states of affairs. Still\nit seems that competent speakers can and do consistently judge certain\nactions right but not good. A different strategy would be to\ndistinguish varieties of positive attitudes such that one sort\ninvolves a kind of approval distinctive of rightness, whereas another\ninvolves a kind distinctive of goodness. Yet another method would be\nto use something like the two step approach Gibbard uses when he\nanalyzes judgments of rightness in terms of judging it rationally\nappropriate to feel guilt and anger at certain actions. The approval\ncould be all of the same sort, but the objects of approval might be\nfeelings of guilt in one case and feelings of sorrow in the other,\neven when these feelings are directed at one and the same object such\nas an action. No doubt there are other available strategies so the\nproblem does not by itself constitute an objection. It can however\ncomplicate the task of constructing an adequate non-cognitivist\ntheory, especially since it can impact the force of other objections\nas with the embedding problem and moral dilemmas noted above.\n\nSection 4.1 above explained the embedding problem, which involves\ncoming up with a compositional theory of meaning for sentences that\nembed indicative moral sentences. And the discussion in that section\nwas largely focussed on embeddings involving operations such as\nnegation, conjunction, disjunction and conditionalization and the\nlogical adequacy of various accounts of these. We also embed moral and\nnormative sentences in attitude reports involving a variety of\nattitudes. It seems plausible that noncognitivists should interpret\nbelief reports such as \u201cJasmine believes that lying is\nwrong,\u201d to attribute to Jasmine the attitude (which according to\nexpressivism) is expressed by \u2018lying is wrong\u2019. But we can\nattribute other attitudes towards what a cognitivist might think to be\nthe same proposition. Jasmine might wonder whether lying is wrong, or\nwish it was not wrong. Or be glad that it is. The noncognitivist will\nneed an account of what it is to have these attitudes and this account\nwill need to fit coherently with their account of what it is to\nbelieve that lying is wrong. This is what Schroeder (2010 at 84) calls\nthe \u201cMany Attitudes problem\u201d. See also Carr (2015),\nK\u00f6hler (2017), Shiller (2017), Beddor (2020a) and Baker\n(2021)\n\nRelatedly, noncognitivists will want to distinguish moral judgements\nfrom aesthetic judgements and from other favorable or unfavorable\nattitudes, if only to distinguish genuine disagreement from seeming\ndisagreement. Alex Miller (2003 at 43\u201351) dubs this the\n\u201cSpecification Problem\u201d and it is taken up by Merli (2008)\nand Bj\u00f6rnsson & McPherson (2014). (Blackburn 1998 at\n13\u201314 professes skepticism that such a division can be\nmade.)\n",
