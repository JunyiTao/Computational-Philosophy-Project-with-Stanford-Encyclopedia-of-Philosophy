    "main_text": "Zen\u2019s Understanding of Time and Space || Here and Now\n7.1 Here and Now\n\nIn spite of, or rather because of, the above-mentioned experiential\ndimension of Zen-seeing, Zen insists that the Zen practitioner plant\nhis or her feet in the everydayness of \u201chere and now.\u201d In\nthis respect, Zen philosophically advocates a position of \u201cnot\none,\u201d where \u201cone\u201d here means remaining in the state\nof meditative absorption. Otherwise, it fears that if the practitioner\nremains in the stillness of meditation, while suspending judgment on\naction, it falls into one-sidedness, a source of prejudice and\nmisunderstanding of reality. How then does Zen understand \u201chere\nand now\u201d? In this connection, one may reasonably ask: \u201chow\nfar and wide is \u2018here\u2019 and how long is\n\u2018now,\u2019\u201d when Zen speaks of \u201chere and\nnow.\u201d Are they each limited by a present perceptual experience?\nIn the case of \u201cnow,\u201d for example, is it an internal\nphenomenon of consciousness that allows the practitioner to experience\ntime sometimes as a \u201cmemory\u201d (or retention) and some other\ntimes as \u201canticipation\u201d (or \u201cprotention\u201d) in\nthe ever flowing stream of \u201cpresent\u201d (e.g., as described\nby St. Augustine, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty)? And in the case of\n\u201chere,\u201d is it delimited by the practitioner\u2019s\nspatial range of perception within the sensory field, situating the\nZen practitioner as the point of reference? (There is in both cases a\nsuggestion of involvement of the autonomous activity of the\nunconscious, of which Zen demands we must stand outside.) Zen\u2019s\nresponse to both of these questions is a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d\nand \u201cNo!\u201d however contradictory it may\nsound. \u201cYes,\u201d because the practitioner, while living,\ncannot depart from the \u201chere and now,\u201d because he or she\nis incarnate, in which case time and space is always experienced as\n\u201chere and now.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d insofar as the\nperceptual model implies an ego-logical \u201chuman, all too\nhuman\u201d stance (Nietzsche) with its attendant limitations, even\nthough Zen does not exclude this model as long as it is not delimited\nby the dualistic, either-or ego-logical perspective. In the everyday\nhuman world that is \u201chere and now,\u201d Zen maintains that\n\u201criddhi and [its] wondrous activity all shoulder water\nand carry firewood\u201d where \u201criddhi\u201d refers\nto a power that naturally becomes available to the practitioner\nthrough the practice of meditation. \n",
