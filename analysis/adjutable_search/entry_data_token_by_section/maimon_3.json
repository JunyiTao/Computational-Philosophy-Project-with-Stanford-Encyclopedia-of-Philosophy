    "main_text": "Logic and the Law of Determinability\n4. Logic and the Law of Determinability\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason Kant contemplates the\npossibility of a law that would govern the content of\nsynthetic judgements. This law is supposed to be a complement to the\nprinciples of non-contradiction and excluded middle, which govern the\nlogical form of both synthetic and analytic propositions. The\nlaw, which Kant terms \u201cThe Principle of Thoroughgoing\nDeterminability\u201d (Grundsatz der durchgaengigen\nBestimmung), states that \u201cof every pair of possible [and\nopposite] predicates, one of them must apply\u201d to every single\nthing [A573/B601]. As a result, every single thing would be thoroughly\ndetermined with regard to any pair of opposite predicates. This law\nseems to necessitate the idea of the sum total of all possibility, and\nas a further result, the concept of an ens realismus. Kant\nargues, however, that this derivation is not valid insofar as it\nattempts to apply a principle that is limited to possible experience\nto all things (including things in themselves) [A583/B661]. Like Kant,\nMaimon too suggests a transcendental principle that will govern\nsynthetic propositions with regard to their content and not their form\n(the latter being governed by the law of non-contradiction). In spite\nof these similarities, Maimon\u2019s Law of Determinability (Satz\nder Bestimmbarkeit) is significantly different from the one\noffered by Kant. The two laws not only differ with regard to their\ncontents, but they also serve different functions, and have different\nweight in the two systems. While the Kantian law has a relatively\nmarginal place within his systems (and is considered by many scholars\nas a mere residue of the metaphysical inheritance of Baumgarten and\nWolff), Maimon\u2019s law seems to be the crucial axis of his\npositive philosophy.\n\n\u2026 [T]he principle of determinability laid down in this\nwork is a principle of all objectively real thought, and\nconsequently of philosophy as a whole too. All the\npropositions of philosophy can be derived from, and be determined by\nit. (Between Kant and Hegel: Texts in the Development of\nPost-Kantian Idealism, George di Giovanni and H.S. Harris (trans.\n& ed.), 165 | Maimon, Gesammelte Werke, V 368).\n\n\nThe two laws also differ with regard to their domains of\napplicability. While Kant restricts his law to possible experience,\nMaimon argues that the demands of his law are satisfied only within\nthe domain of a priori thinking, and that empirical cognition\nfails to pass its test.\n\nThe main aim of Maimon\u2019s Law of Determinability is to provide a\ncriterion that would distinguish between syntheses that\nreflect a real connection between concepts, and\narbitrary syntheses, which result from the mere activity of\nthe imagination. Real syntheses are of crucial importance for Maimon,\nsince through this kind of syntheses we can create new concepts, and,\nin the case of a priori syntheses, even create genuine\nobjects. But whether this can actually come about is where\nMaimon\u2019s skeptical worries come to the fore. According to\nMaimon, in any real synthesis of a subject and a predicate, the\nfollowing two principles must be observed:\n\n\n(1) A principle for the subject in general: every subject\nmust be a possible object of consciousness, not only as a subject but\nalso in itself;\n\n(2) A principle for predicates: every predicate must be a\npossible object of consciousness, not in itself, but only as a\npredicate (in connection with the subject) What does not conform to\nthis principle can be a merely formal, or arbitrary,\nbut not a real thought (GW V, 78 | VnL 20).\n\n\nA synthetic judgment then accords with the law of determinability when\nits predicate is a real determination of the subject (i.e., when its\npredicate is asymmetrically dependent upon its subject). Thus, for\nexample, in the synthesis \u2018straight line\u2019, the predicate\n\u2018straight\u2019 is a real determination of the subject\n\u2018line\u2019, since one can think of the subject without the\nconcept of the predicate, while one can conceive of straightness only\nthrough the concept of a line. In an empirical synthesis, such as,\n\u2018red line\u2019, the predicate is merely an arbitrary\ndetermination insofar as our intellect does not decipher any internal\nconnection and dependence between the subject and the predicate (and\nsince we can easily imagine other subjects having the same predicate)\n(GW II, 92\u20133 | VT 92\u20133).\n\nRelying on the principle of determinability, we can distinguish\nbetween the subject and the predicate of a given synthesis, e.g., in\nthe synthesis \u2018acute triangle\u2019 we can see that\n\u2018triangle\u2019 can be thought without \u2018acute\u2019 but\nnot the other way around, and hence ascertain that \u2018acute\u2019\nis the predicate and \u2018triangle\u2019 the subject. Now, we can\nof course go one step further and try to unfold the concept of\n\u2018triangle\u2019. But here, the principle of determinability\ncould assist us only to a limited degree. It will not tell us what is\nthe genus under which \u2018triangle\u2019 falls. All it can do is\nto provide a negative criterion once we suggest such a genus.\nThus, the principle will tell us that \u2018triangle\u2019 is not a\ndetermination of a specific figure which I see in front of me (since I\ncan conceive of a triangle without thinking of the figure in front of\nme). Once I come with another candidate, such as \u2018space\u2019\nand suggest that \u2018triangle\u2019 might be a determination of\n\u2018space\u2019, the principle will approve this suggestion, since\nwe cannot think of a \u2018triangle\u2019 without\n\u2018space\u2019, though we can think of \u2018space\u2019\nwithout \u2018triangle\u2019. This is the first main role of the\nprinciple of determinability: it assists us in uncovering the main\ncategories of thought and their interrelations.\n\nThe other main role of the principle is to assist us in forming new\nconcepts (this is Maimon\u2019s attempt to have an ars\ninvendi ). Here again, the principle provides us only with a\nnegative criterion. If we ask ourselves: what are the possible\ndeterminations of \u2018line\u2019, the principle would not tell us\nthat \u2018straight\u2019 is such a determination. Only once we\nsuggest \u2018straight\u2019 as such a determination, could the\nprinciple evaluate \u2014 and in this case, approve \u2014 the\nrelation of \u2018straight\u2019 to \u2018line\u2019.\n\nMaimon\u2019s reliance on mathematical examples is not coincidental,\nsince it is (primarily) in mathematics that we find real syntheses,\nnamely, syntheses that pass the test of the law of determinability.\nThis special advantage of mathematics is due to the role of\nconstruction in mathematics. Thus, in the case of the straight line\nthe intellect commands a construction of a line in pure intuition\naccording to the concept of straight. In such a way, the connection\nbetween the subject and the predicate, while synthetic, is\nnevertheless necessary. (As Freudenthal (2006) notes, however, as\nMaimon\u2019s thought develops he becomes more skeptical that\nstraightness can be constructed according to the concept of a line, or\nthat a circle can be constructed from its concept. Since these stand\nat the heart of Euclidean geometry, Freudenthal argues that while\nMaimon holds that geometry is synthetic, he begins to doubt that it is\nabsolutely necessary, since it must rely on ineliminable intuitions\nrather than the understanding alone.) By contrast, a judgment such as\n\u201cThe cup is green\u201d fails to accord with the law of\ndeterminability, for the connection between the subject and the\npredicate remains merely problematic. For our intellect, the greenness\nof the cup is something that is merely encountered, rather than\nconsciously constructed, and thus it fails to express any internal\nconnection between the subject and its predicate. By using the Law of\nDeterminability Maimon thought to provide a way both to generate new\nconcepts as well as to decipher the basic categories of thought.\nMathematics provides us with an example of how these derivations\nshould work. However, this law also seems to point out the\nunreliability of empirical judgments.\n\nDeterminability then provides a standard of synthetic judgments: it\ntells us not merely the form that such judgments must take, but also\nspecifies what counts as a legitimate content of such a judgment. In\nthis sense, determinability provides a certain cohesion between the\nproducts of the mind. But while the Law of Determinability presents\nthe standard which real thought must meet, it is important to\nnote that Maimon remains dubious about the possibility of ever\nachieving real thought except in the realm of mathematics. Only when\nthe determinable relation between the subject and predicate of a\njudgment is constructed can real thought be reached; in\nempirical judgments about the world, no such determinable relation can\nbe proved. And it is just this concern that leads to Maimon\u2019s\nskepticism.\n\n",
