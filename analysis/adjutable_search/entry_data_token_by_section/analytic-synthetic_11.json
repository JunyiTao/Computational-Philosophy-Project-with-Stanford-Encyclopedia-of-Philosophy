    "main_text": "Post-Quinean Strategies\n4. Post-Quinean Strategies\n\nThere has been a wide variety of responses to Quine\u2019s\nchallenges. Some, for example, Davidson (1980), Stich (1983) and\nDennett (1987), seem simply to accept it and try to account for our\npractice of meaning ascription within its \u201cnon-factual\u201d\nbounds. Since they follow Quine in at least claiming to forswear the\nanalytic, we will not consider their views further here. Others, who\nmight be (loosely) called \u201cneo-Cartesians,\u201d reject\nQuine\u2019s attack as simply so much prejudice of the empiricism and\nnaturalism that they take to be his own uncritical dogmas (\u00a74.1\nin what follows). Still others hope simply to find a way to break out\nof the \u201cintentional circle,\u201d and provide an account of at\nleast what it means for one thing (a state of the brain, for example)\nto mean (or \u201ccarry the information about\u201d) another\nexternal phenomenon in the world (\u00a74.2). Perhaps the most\ntrenchant reaction has been that of empirically oriented linguists and\nphilosophers, who look to a specific explanatory role the analytic may\nplay in an account of thought and talk (\u00a74.3). This role is\ncurrently being explored in considerable detail in the now various\nareas of research inspired by the important linguistic theories of\nNoam Chomsky (\u00a74.4, and supplement, Analyticity and Chomskyan\nLinguistics).\n",
