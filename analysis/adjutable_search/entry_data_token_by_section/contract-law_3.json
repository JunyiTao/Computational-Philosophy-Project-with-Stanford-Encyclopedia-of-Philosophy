    "main_text": "General Theories of the Law of Contracts || Enabling mutually beneficial exchange\n1.3 Enabling mutually beneficial exchange\n\nThere is room to question whether the law (especially in a liberal\nstate) should be in the business of enforcing moral duties associated\nwith promising. The economic approach to contract law de-emphasizes\ncontract\u2019s promissory roots and instead locates the law\u2019s\njustification in general welfare: the rules of contract law enable\nsocially productive reliance on promises and mutually beneficial\nexchange. This approach is more prominent among academic lawyers than\namong philosophers, and is widely regarded, at least in the United\nStates, as the leading interdisciplinary approach to contract law.\n\nThe economic analysis of contract begins, in effect, with Hume\u2019s\nobservation that\n\n\nexperience has taught us, that human affairs wou\u2019d be conducted\nmuch more for mutual advantage, were there certain symbols or signs\ninstituted, by which we might give each other security of our conduct\nin any particular incident. (A Treatise of Human Nature, bk.\n3, pt. II, sec. v [Of the Obligation of Promises], emphasis\nremoved)\n\n\nWhen parties exchange promises as part of a bargain, they usually\nstand to gain from mutual performance, but in the absence of a\ncommitment mechanism, each has an incentive to defect; and, since the\nparties can foresee the defections, they might fail to invest in and\nor enter into mutually beneficial bargains. The law prevents\nself-interest from getting in the way of mutual advantage by\nenabling\n\n\nindividuals to bind themselves to a future course of conduct, to make\nit easier for others to arrange their lives in reliance on [a]\npromise. (Craswell 1989: 496; see generally Goetz & Scott 1980;\ncf. Atiyah 1979)\n\n\nThis power-conferring conception of contract law is generally\nunderstood as having normative import: contracts should be enforced\njust insofar as doing so (by increasing confidence in the promises\nthat they contain) establishes optimal incentives for reliance and\nmaximizes the joint surplus produced through contractual coordination\n(see, e.g., Schwartz & Scott 2003: 541). A striking upshot is that\nnothing in the intrinsic character of contract law favors\npromise-based or chosen obligation; instead, everything depends on\ncontingent facts about which legal forms coordinate mutual reliance in\nthe most \u201cefficient\u201d or welfare maximizing way.\n\nMost lawyer-economists adopt an overtly revisionary stance towards\nparticular legal rules. Some argue that the law should be more\nsolicitous of promissory reliance in the absence of\nconsideration\u2014especially reliance on pre-contractual\nrepresentations\u2014than orthodox contract doctrine allows (see,\ne.g., Bebchuk & Ben-Shahar 2001: 427; Ben-Shahar 2004; Craswell\n1996; Johnston 1999; Katz 1996). In addition, and independently, the\neconomic approach rejects orthodox contract law\u2019s categorical\npreference for expectation-based remedies. Such remedies may or may\nnot support optimal reliance; but in either case, the promise-based\nidea of securing the promisee\u2019s expectations \u201cwill not\nhave played any role in the analysis leading up to [the]\nconclusion\u201d about which remedy is optimal (Craswell 2000:\n107).\n\nAlthough no longer seen as a primarily descriptive theory, the\neconomic approach appears to rationalize established doctrines that\ncompeting views struggle to explain. The approach seems tailormade to\nexplain the law\u2019s encouragement of \u201cefficient\nbreach\u201d (discussed earlier, in\n \u00a71.1).\n Though even here there are puzzles. It remains unclear why contract\nlaw is unwilling to promote efficiency through orders of specific\nperformance (Ayres & Klass 2017). After all, it is likely costly\nto deal with an unwilling counterparty forced to perform, so promisees\nwill usually seek specific performance only when expectation damages\nare genuinely undercompensatory or hard to calculate (Schwartz 1979).\nAt the very least, an efficient contract law should allow parties, ex\nante, to contract for the specific performance remedy or even for\nsupra-compensatory \u201cpenalties\u201d that assure performance by\nrequiring damages upon breach that exceed the promisee\u2019s\nexpectation interest (see discussion in Edlin 1996; Edlin &\nSchwartz 2003; Shavell 1980). But, in fact, the law does not condone\nsuch agreements, even between sophisticated parties (R2: \u00a7356;\nsee, e.g., Lake River v. Carborundum (1985)). A possible\nexplanation is that penalty clauses enable inefficient collusion by\nestablished firms to keep new entrants out of markets.\n\nThe view that contract law, in its positive expression, promotes\nefficient investment and exchange is hard to maintain in the face of\ndoctrinal challenges (see, e.g., Posner 2003). \u201cThis is Not a\nLegally Enforceable Agreement\u201d clauses used by parties to\ndisclaim their intent for an agreement to be legally enforceable are\nnot always enforced. Similarly, efforts by parties to opt out of legal\nduties in the pre-contractual bargaining phase, including duties\nrelated to disclosure of information, are often deemed legally\nineffective (V.S.H. v. Texaco (1985)). In all such cases, the\nlaw\u2019s reluctance to cater to parties\u2019 preferences is not\nstraightforwardly explainable in power-conferring or general welfarist\nterms. For an exploration of the degree to which the law\u2019s\nmandatory constraints can be explained from the standpoint of\nefficiency, see Zamir and Ayres (2020).\n\nAnother explanatory puzzle is broader and focuses not on specific\ndoctrines but rather on contract law\u2019s generic structure. The\neconomic approach is free to focus on efficiency and to disregard both\ndistributive fairness and freedom only insofar as it ignores the\ninequities and vulnerabilities that figure in the lives of natural\npersons. The most sophisticated economists recognize this and limit\nthe domain of their arguments to contracts among firms owned by\ndiversified shareholders (see, e.g., Schwartz & Scott 2003). This\nfocus on firms suits the efficiency standard: firms are artificial\nentities, so that concerns about freedom and autonomy are irrelevant\nto regulating their behavior. Moreover, the diversified holdings of\nthe natural persons who own the firms cause legal rules to have no\ndistributive effects across owners since the owners hold shares in\nfirms that are benefited as well as those that are burdened by every\nlegal rule. The firms that the economic approach focuses on are,\ntherefore, mere instrumentalities of shareholders who, insofar as they\nown (or could own) diversified portfolios, are all more or less\nidentically situated with respect to every transaction that contract\nlaw might regulate. This suggests that the economic approach abandons\na basic presupposition from which the study of contract law as the law\nof agreements ordinarily begins. Contracts, intuitively understood,\ninvolve coordination among multiple parties with distinct interests.\nBut there is a sense in which the transactions modelled by economic\ntheory ultimately involve only one such party: the diversified\nshareholder who stands behind the firms on both sides of every\ncontract. This is of course an idealized model, and actual firms will\noften have differentiated owners. Nevertheless, the model casts doubt\non whether transactions among firms should be understood, in the end,\nto be agreements at all.\n\nFinally, the economic view\u2019s normative assumptions have been\nsubject to criticism. Dworkin (1975: 1061) argues that judges should\ndecide bilateral disputes based on the parties\u2019 established\nrights and considerations of interpersonal fairness, while leaving the\ncrafting of rules based on general welfare to \u201c[t]he political\nsystem of representative democracy\u201d. The economic approach seems\nto ignore these limits to judicial authority. A different normative\ncritique (discussed more broadly within the entry on the\n philosophy of economics)\n targets the definition of welfare that animates work in this area.\nEconomists tend to equate the parties\u2019 welfare with preference\nsatisfaction, while inferring the strength of preferences based on a\nwillingness to pay. This approach biases measurements of efficiency in\nfavor of the rich given that the willingness to pay is sensitive to\nbackground endowments (Liscow 2018). In the context of contractual\nexchange, an approach that aims to maximize preference satisfaction is\nat least more or less constrained by the Pareto criterion (an outcome\ncounts as a Pareto improvement only if it is preferred by at least one\nperson and not dispreferred by anyone), because both parties to every\ncontract must agree before it becomes enforceable. But even here, the\npreference-satisfaction/welfare equivalence remains vulnerable to\ncritique for being based on an impoverished account of the social good\n(Radin 1987; Murphy 2014; Mullen 2016).\n",
