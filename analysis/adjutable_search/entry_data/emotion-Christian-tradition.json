    "main_text": "\n1. History of emotion in Christianity\n1.1. Emotions in the New Testament\n\nFor theologians and Christian thinkers, the New Testament, read\nagainst the background of the Hebrew Bible, is in some sense\nauthoritative. So it is the place to begin a discussion of emotions in\nthe Christian tradition. The New Testament features, in varying\ndegrees of prominence, a number of attitudinal phenomena that in\nmodern parlance would be called emotions and the practices in which\nemotions are expressed: joy and rejoicing, gratitude and thanksgiving,\nremorse (grief) or regret and repentance, compassion, anger, fear,\nsorrow, envy, pride, shame, contempt, and others. Instances of these\nattitudinal phenomena vary in how theology-laden they are, and in this\nsense vary as to whether they count as \u201creligious\u201d\nemotions.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent of these attitudinal phenomena is joy\n(chairein, chara, and to a much lesser extent\nagalliasthai, agalliasis). It is especially\nprominent in the writings of the apostle Paul, who includes joy in his\nlist of the \u201cfruit of the [Holy] Spirit\u201d in Galatians 5:22\u20133.\nThe idea seems to be that when joy is a fruit of the Spirit, it is\nabout what God has done, God\u2019s identity or attributes, or the\nbeliever\u2019s relation to God. That is, the \u201ccontent\u201d of the joy is a\ntheological belief. Strikingly, the object of joy sometimes includes\nsuffering. For example, the Acts of the Apostles (chapter 5) reports\nthat the apostles had been gaining a considerable following in\nJerusalem and the high priest reacted by throwing them in prison.\nThey escaped, and the next day they were back preaching and teaching.\nThe authorities picked them up again and warned them to stop their\npublic activities, but the apostles were defiant, saying that God had\nordered them to do this. So they were flogged and again admonished to\ncease their activities. \u201cAs [the apostles] left the council, they\nrejoiced (chairontes) that they were considered worthy\nto suffer dishonor for the sake of the name [of Jesus]\u201d (Acts 5:41;\nNew Revised Standard Version; hereafter all New Testament quotations\nare from this translation. See also Romans 5:3 and Colossians 1:24).\nThese instances of joy are thoroughly theological, for the believer\u2019s\njoy is about his or her service to and identification with Jesus, the\nSon of God.\n\nIn the following passage, Paul rejoices about somebody else\u2019s\nsuffering, though not maliciously, but out of love for the sufferer.\n\u201cNow I rejoice (chair\u014d), not because you were grieved\n(elup\u0113th\u0113te), but because your grief\n(lup\u0113) led to repentance (metanoian); for you\nfelt a godly grief (elup\u0113th\u0113te gar kata theon), so\nthat you were not harmed in any way by us. For godly grief (kata\ntheon lup\u0113) produces a repentance that leads to salvation\nand brings no regret (ametamel\u0113ton), but worldly grief\n(tou kosmou lup\u0113) produces death. [For discussion of\nemotions belonging to the family of regret, remorse, and repentance,\nsee Bash 2019).] For see what earnestness this godly grief has\nproduced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation,\nwhat alarm, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point\nyou have proved yourselves guiltless in this matter\u201d (II Corinthians\n7:9\u201311). Here Paul the pastor rejoices over the Corinthians\u2019\nsorrow, not simply because of their emotional pain, but because of the\ncharacter of their pain \u2014 that it was about something\ngenuinely lamentable (some inappropriate attitude or action of theirs,\nconsidered in the light of God\u2019s will). This grief was not a harm to\nthe Corinthians, but an expression of their spiritual health and\nwellbeing. This sorrow is something to rejoice about, because it was a\ngood thing for them and for the whole church. This might be an example\nof a joy that is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, a joy that\nbetokens harmony of mind with the mind of God. So Paul\u2019s joy, as well\nas the Corinthians\u2019 grief, is heavily theology-laden: both emotions\nare situational construals that incorporate Christian beliefs.\n\nConsider now an episode of joy that is attributed to a Christian in\nthe New Testament, but which may be more mundane, or even \u201csecular.\u201d\nKing Herod is persecuting the church and has the apostle Peter\nthrown in prison and kept under heavy guard. But, the night before\nHerod is planning to bring Peter out of prison and encourage something\nbad to happen to him, Peter escapes miraculously and goes to a house\nwhere members of the church are meeting and fervently praying for\nPeter. \u201cWhen he knocked at the outer gate, a maid named Rhoda came to\nanswer. On recognizing Peter\u2019s voice, she was so overjoyed that\n(apo t\u0113s charas), instead of opening the gate, she ran\nin and announced that Peter was standing at the gate\u201d (Acts\n12:13\u201314). How theology-laden is Rhoda\u2019s joy? I think that will\ndepend on the depth of Rhoda\u2019s catechesis. In any case, it is probably\nshallower than Paul\u2019s. It is possible that Rhoda is simply caught up\nin the church\u2019s enthusiasm to get Peter back and is a beneficiary of\nemotional contagion. It is also possible that, given that she has just\nstepped out of a meeting heavy into prayer for Peter\u2019s rescue, Rhoda\nis at the moment theologically primed to construe the situation in\nChristian terms. And it is also possible that Rhoda\u2019s joy arises from\na deep piety \u2014 a thorough-going personal integration of the\nChristian vision of God\u2019s purposes \u2014 that she rejoices\nspontaneously out of these character-resources, and that her joy is\nspecifically gratitude to God.\n\nAnd last, consider a joy which, if theology-laden, is, according to\nthe New Testament, laden with bad theology. Judas Iscariot has\nconceived the wish to betray Jesus to the hostile authorities.\n\u201c[Judas] went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers\nof the temple police about how he might betray [Jesus] to them. They\nwere greatly pleased (echar\u0113san) and agreed to give him\nmoney\u201d (Luke 22:4\u20135). Perhaps the religious authorities, like\nsome crazed terrorists, thought they were doing the will of God in\ngetting Jesus judicially murdered. In that case, their joy was\ntheology-laden and thus religious. But Mark\u2019s Gospel (15:10) comments\nthat Pilate knew that it was out of envy (phthonos) that the\nreligious authorities wanted to be rid of Jesus. If this is right,\nthen their joy at Judas\u2019s offer was not religious at all, but\nmotivated by a vicious secular defensiveness of their own power\nand glory.\n\nJoy is a paradigmatic emotion in the New Testament, and the New\nTestament is the originary document of Christianity. A thorough\ntreatment of emotions in the New Testament would take several other\nemotion-types into consideration, and go much deeper into joy than we\nhave done here. But this brief treatment of joy should serve our\npurposes in this article.\n1.2 Passions, affections, and emotions\n\nIs \u2018emotion\u2019 the right term for the experiences under\nconsideration? In Thomas Dixon\u2019s well-known study (2003) of the\nhistory of the concept of emotion, he argues that the term\n\u2018emotion\u2019 was coined in the early 19th century, by\npsychologists impressed with physics, as a secular replacement for the\nmorally, religiously, and metaphysically freighted distinction between\n\u2018passion\u2019 and \u2018affection.\u2019 In the older\nChristian psychology (which still had distinguished representatives in\nthe late 19th century), the phenomena that we call emotions were\ncalled passions and affections, these two categories being\ndistinguished from one another. Aquinas is a paradigm thinker in this\npsychology of \u201cemotions.\u201d Passions (passiones)\nare feeling-responses such as humans share with animals, responses to\nbodily and sensory occurrences (e.g. sense perceptions of danger, of\nfood, of sexual opportunity). They are marked by visceral commotion\nand are associated with moral temptation or turpitude. Affections\n(affectiones), by contrast, are generated not in the sensory\nappetite, but in the will or intellectual appetite, a psychological\ncapacity peculiar to human beings. Human beings share\naffectiones not with the animals, but with higher beings such\nas angels and God. Passions, however, are not always sinful, and a\npassion can be transformed into an affection if the person feeling it\nendorses it by an act of the will or intellectual appetite. Dixon\nargues that \u2018emotion\u2019 was coined by physiological\npsychologists Thomas Brown, Herbert Spencer, and Alexander Bain. It\nwas later adopted by William James (1884), though his work on\nreligious experience (1901\u201302) was more phenomenological and less\nfocused on physical causation. In \u201cWhat Is An Emotion\u201d\n(1884) James famously proposed that an emotion is just an awareness of\na bodily perturbation that is directly produced by objects (for\nexample, a large bear advancing toward you on a lonely path). In\npsychology even today \u2018emotion\u2019 tends to have this\nphysicalist connotation and is less discriminating than the earlier\nvocabulary of passions and affections, with its openness to spiritual\n\u201cemotions.\u201d Rather than call the briefly sketched biblical\nresponses of joy and so forth emotions, would it not be more\ndiscriminating and less confusing to follow the earlier Christian\nvocabulary and call them affections? If gratitude can succeed, as\nreligious people think it can, in being to God, and if Paul\u2019s joy can\nbe about the moral status of the Corinthians\u2019 remorse, then they\nseem clearly not to be simple responses to physical or\nsensory stimuli. Indeed, most human emotions fail to\nqualify as emotions in the original historical sense of the word. The\nkind that does plausibly qualify \u2014 \u201cthe startle response\u201d\n(see Robinson 1995) \u2014 is only controversially an emotion in\nour ordinary sense of the word. Our ordinary sense is very far from\nits historical origin as Dixon has traced it. Dixon is right that\n\u2018emotion\u2019 blurs the distinction that \u2018passion\u2019\nand \u2018affection\u2019 once embodied. But arguably that\ndistinction is well lost. Fears marked by strong physiological\ncommotion can be evoked by objects inaccessible to animals without an\nintellect, for example, a fall in the stock market. And it seems to\ntake more than the mere sensory \u201cstimulus\u201d of a large bear\ncoming toward me on a lonely path to arouse fear. For example, I may\nrecognize her as my pet, and her rapid advance as her enthusiasm in\ngreeting me. Nor is the moral dividing line between passions and\naffections valid. Passions may be morally beautiful (for example, a\nwoman\u2019s erotically tinged joy upon seeing her husband after an\nabsence) and affections despicable (the cool cruel joy of humiliating\na colleague as you dismantle his pet argument). The very indifference\nof the concept of emotion to whether the object is simple or\nintellectually complex, sensory or not, whether accompanied or not by\nbodily perturbations, and whether it merits moral evaluation or not,\nseems to recommend it in preference to the older vocabulary.\nGratitude, contrition, compassion, joy, hope, and all the other\nreligious emotions fit quite commodiously in the category of\nemotion.\n2. Essentialism in the conception of religious emotions\n\nEssentialism in the conception of religious emotions is the view that\nthere is some universal religious emotion \u2014 an emotion or\nemotion-like affection that is the single universal essence of all\nreligious experiences, and the feature that makes them\nproperly religious.\n\nIn the first section of this article, we have assumed diversity among\nthe types of emotion that might be called \u201creligious.\u201d Joy,\ncompassion, remorse, and so forth, are different\nemotion types. The unity we find among them, in\ncontradistinction from \u201csecular\u201d emotions, is their theological\nreference or \u201ccontent.\u201d Insofar as they are distinctively Christian,\nthey all draw on Christian doctrine. Yet they pick from that body of\ndoctrine different bits and deploy them to different purposes.\nThe terms in which the believer construes the object of\ncompassion will differ from the terms in which, when she feels\ngratitude to God, she construes herself, a benefit, and God.\nIndeed, what differentiates one emotion type from another seems to\nbe the terms of the construal.\n\nFriedrich Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834) was a Christian theologian,\nbut he sought to understand the essence of religion in general, of\nwhich Christianity was presumably an instance. He held that the\nessence of religion is piety and that piety consists in the feeling of\nabsolute dependence. What is the feeling of absolute dependence, and\nhow is it related to more specific religious emotions?\n\nFeeling is \u201cimmediate\u201d self-consciousness as contrasted\nwith \u201cthat consciousness of self which is more like an objective\nconsciousness, being a representation of oneself, and thus mediated by\nself-contemplation\u201d (The Christian Faith, \u00a73.2).\nFor Schleiermacher \u2018immediate\u2019 contrasts with\n\u2018analytic\u2019; he seems to have in mind something like what\npeople mean when they say that feelings are\n\u2018non-cognitive\u2019: that they precede and cannot be captured\nin articulate thought. Joy, he says, is a genuine state of feeling,\nbut self-approval \u201cbelong[s] to the objective consciousness of\nself\u201d (ibid.). One might feel joy without knowing why,\nbut presumably self-approval requires that one have reasons; thus the\nformer is immediate, the latter analytic.\n\nSchleiermacher says that at a certain stage of cultural and individual\ndevelopment all human beings have two feelings (states of\nself-consciousness) with respect to the world: the feeling of\nfreedom and the feeling of dependence. The feeling of freedom\ncorresponds to Activity, and is the feeling of being\neffective with respect to changes in the world. This will include\nnot only bringing about physical changes (say, digging a hole in the\nearth) but also perceiving things (perceiving is a sort of activity\nwith respect to the thing perceived) and thinking about them. By\ncontrast, the feeling of dependence corresponds to\nReceptivity and is the feeling of being acted upon by things\nin the world (say, being affected by the food one eats or helped by\nfellow human beings). Vis-\u00e0-vis the world and the\nthings in the world, people always have a mixture of the feeling of\nfreedom and the feeling of dependence. One never has a feeling of\nabsolute (unqualified, schlechthinig) freedom with respect to\nanything, for no matter how active one is with respect to it, there\nwill always be an element of receptivity or dependence on it or some\naspect of it or something closely associated with it.\n\nThe same is true of dependence, as far as the relation to things in\nthe world is concerned. You are never purely or absolutely\ndependent on things in the world. If, for example, you were completely\nparalyzed but still conscious, you would be very dependent, but\npresumably could still focus your attention or this or that thing on\nwhich you were dependent, and to that extent would engage in free\nactivity and have the corresponding feeling. It is another matter,\nhowever, if your thought ventures beyond the world. If you think, not\nof anything in the world, but of the world as a\nwhole (including yourself as part of the world) and then think\nwhat is beyond that, then the feeling you have with respect to that\nabsolute Beyond is absolute \u201cdependence,\u201d in the sense of being\nconscious of having no power with respect to it, being utterly unable\nto affect it (even by perceiving or thinking it). On this account, the\nobject of the feeling of absolute dependence is what is utterly beyond\nthe world or universe, regarded as everything that exists, and it is\nthe feeling of your own impotence with respect to that\n\u201cobject.\u201d\n\nOur natural cognitive equipment suffices to bring about the feeling of\nabsolute dependence. It requires only the idea that existing things\nhave causes and the idea of all existing things taken together. From\nthis we get the idea of God as the cause of all that is. But then\nwe think, if God exists, then God is part of all that is, and\nthe urge for a causal explanation recurs: where did God come from?\nTheists put a stop to this line of thought by declaring that God has\nnecessary existence, and so God, unlike everything else, doesn\u2019t need\nto be caused. But the very question has projected the mind beyond the\nwhole of what exists, to the radical other side of being,\nand that other side is not only absolutely uninflenceable, it is\nnot even thinkable. And so the feeling generated by this thought is\nthe feeling of absolute dependence.\n\nHow is the feeling of absolute dependence related to episodes of the\nparticular religious emotion-types, such as joy, gratitude, hope,\ncontrition, compassion, and sorrow? The short answer is that for\nSchleiermacher the feeling of absolute dependence is the essentially\nreligious element in these emotions (see ibid.,\n\u00a75.4\u20135). Without that element, no emotion would be\nreligious. The feeling of absolute dependence is, in itself, not about\nevents taking place in the world; it is about what is beyond\neverything that exists, so its \u201cobject\u201d is completely\nunchanging. The particular religious emotions, by contrast, are\nresponses, some pleasant and some unpleasant, to changes in the finite\nor sensible self-consciousness. Gratitude, for example, is a response\nto a particular kind of situation in which the subject is the\nrecipient of some benefit; contrition is a response to a situation in\nwhich the subject has committed some fault; and so forth. In a more\ntraditional theology, the difference between gratitude to a kind\nneighbor for a benefit and religious gratitude would be that in the\nlatter case the subject is grateful to God for the benefit.\nThe subject would causally attribute the benefit to God. Similarly,\nthe difference between feeling guilty for having lied to one\u2019s\nneighbor and religious contrition would be that the subject would\nthink of his fault as having offended God. Something like\nthis idea is behind Schleiermacher\u2019s claim that the feeling of\nabsolute dependence is the religious element in every religious\nemotion. However, he certainly does not think of the Beyond as\nactually supplying worldly benefits to people, or as being actually\noffended when they perform nasty actions. This would bring the Beyond\nsmack into the world and thus destroy the feeling of absolute\ndependence. Schleiermacher does not give a careful account of the\nrelation between the feeling of absolute dependence and the particular\nemotions, but just says that the feeling \u201cunites with a sensibly\ndetermined self-consciousness, and thus becomes an emotion\n(Erregung)\u2026\u201d (ibid., \u00a75.5). I\noffer the following as a possible clarification, using the example of\ngratitude: some impressive good befalls me, and I recognize it as\nsuch. This recognition is an empirically ascertainable consciousness\nof myself, thus a \u201csensibly determined\nself-consciousness.\u201d Then, in conjunction with this sensibly\ndetermined consciousness of being \u201cmoved\u201d with gratitude,\nI have the feeling of absolute dependence; and thus my ordinary\ngratitude becomes religious, or in traditional terms I am moved with\ngratitude to God.\n\nOne might think that mood would be a better category than\nemotion for interpreting Schleiermacher\u2019s comments about the\nfeeling (Gef\u00fchl) of absolute dependence. (On the\ndifferences between emotion and mood, see Beedie, Terry, and Lane,\n2005.) Feeling is a broader category than emotion. Both moods and\nemotions can be felt, and the diffuseness of the feeling of absolute\ndependence might be thought to warrant this change of category.\nFurthermore, we might see in this change an opportunity to explain\nbetter the relation between the feeling of absolute dependence and the\nparticular religious emotions. Moods, it seems, predispose emotions:\nif you\u2019re irritable, you\u2019re more likely to get angry upon being\ninsulted; if you\u2019re cheerful, you\u2019re more likely to feel joy upon\nbeing told good news; and so forth. And this, we might think, is due\nto the fact that the particular emotions not only are predisposed by\nmoods, but themselves embody moods: joy is cheerful, sorrow is\ndepressed, anger is irritable, and so forth. Similarly, if you\u2019re\nfeeling absolutely dependent, you\u2019re more likely to feel\nreligiously contrite, joyful, grateful, and so forth, and\neach of these particular emotion types embodies the feeling of\nabsolute dependence. This is perhaps a useful suggestion, inasmuch as\nSchleiermacher takes the feeling of absolute dependence to be implicit\nin all religious emotions. One objection to assimilating the feeling\nof absolute dependence to mood would be that\nintentionality seems to be a feature of emotions that\ndistinguishes them from moods, and Schleiermacher clearly specifies\nthe intentionality of the feeling of absolute dependence.\n\nThe feeling of absolute dependence, conceived as Schleiermacher\nconceives it, presents him with several problems that he does not seem\nto resolve. 1) Despite his claim that the feeling is\n\u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense of non-cognitive, we have just\ngiven a quite cognitive account of the feeling. It seems to depend on\na particular way of thinking about the world and what is beyond the\nworld. Both world and agent need to be thought of in terms of effect\nand receptivity to effect; and then the Beyond needs to be conceived\nin analogy and contrast with this aspect of the world, in its relation\nto the agent (subject of the feeling). A person who did not engage in\nthis process of thought, at least covertly or subconsciously, would\nnever get to the feeling of absolute dependence as Schleiermacher\ndescribes it. 2) Schleiermacher is a Christian theologian and thinks\nhe has given an account of the most basic experience of God. But any\nGod who existed would be part of the \u201cworld\u201d on\nSchleiermacher\u2019s conception and thus could not be the object of the\nfeeling of absolute dependence. Furthermore, the God of Christian\ntradition is not utterly incapable of being affected by human beings.\nGod responds to states of the world with actions and emotions, and\nhears and answers prayer. 3) Absolutizing the dependency relationship\nin the way that Schleiermacher does seems to evacuate\n\u2018dependency\u2019 of its usual meaning. The \u201cother\u201d\ntowards which one feels absolutely \u201cdependent\u201d in\nSchleiermacher\u2019s conception must be predicateless to protect it\nagainst any influence (in particular, epistemic contact) from the side\nof the world; but that move eliminates any positive sense in which we\ndepend on it. Absolute dependence in the object comes to equal\nabsolute incapability of being affected, and the feeling of absolute\ndependence amounts to a feeling of complete lack of effective agency\nvis-\u00e0-vis the other \u2014 that is, it becomes a\npurely negative conception. So the feeling of absolute dependence\nmight better be called the feeling of absolute impotence.\n\nA prominent representative of the essentialist thinking about\nreligious emotion of which Schleiermacher seems to be the\noriginator is Rudolf Otto in The Idea of the Holy\n(published 1923). The feeling basic to religion is that of the\nnuminous, of the mysterium tremendum et fascinans (roughly,\n\u201cthe mysterious presence of the wholly other that inspires awe\nand devotion\u201d). \u201cThere is no religion in which it does not\nlive as the real innermost core, and without it no religion would be\nworthy of the name\u201d (p. 6). This feeling is not in itself\nethical; it is not, for example, the feeling of being in the presence\nof a moral judge or command-giver. Thus religion is not just a kind of\nethics, as Kant tended to think. The numinous feeling is \u201ca\nunique original feeling-response, which can be in itself ethically\nneutral and claims consideration in its own right\u201d\n(ibid.). The feeling bears some resemblance to, but also\ndiffers from, a sense of dread, of horror, of the uncanny, the eerie,\nthe weird; it also corresponds to a kind of \u201cwrath\u201d of the\ndivine, a divine demeanor that has about it something incalculable and\narbitrary, a kind of unpredictable majestic overpowering fearsomeness.\nHowever, one can have a feeling of the mysterium that is not\nfear-like; a feeling not of tremor, but of stupor.\n\u201cStupor is plainly a different thing from tremor; it signifies\nblank wonder, an astonishment that strikes us dumb, amazement\nabsolute\u201d (p. 26).\n\nOtto does not attempt to give us a straightforward grammar of the\nnuminous feeling, and says in fact that this cannot be done. Instead,\nhe approaches it by comparing it with other experiences and trying out\nvarious terms that might approach to it in meaning, without exactly\ngetting it; then the idea is that the reader will find the feeling\namong his own experiences, and thus be informed. Otto chides\nSchleiermacher for making the feeling of absolute dependence a mode of\nself-consciousness and for leaving the non-subjective object of the\nfeeling uncharacterized (p. 10). Contrary to Schleiermacher, Otto says\nthe concept of causation is absent from the most basic feeling.\n\u201cThe point from which speculation starts is not a\n\u2018consciousness of absolute dependence\u2019 \u2014 of myself\nas a result and effect of a divine cause \u2014 for that would in\npoint of fact lead to insistence upon the reality of the self [which\non Otto\u2019s construction virtually disappears in the confrontation with\nthe mysterium tremendum]; it starts from a consciousness of\nthe absolute superiority or supremacy of a power other than myself,\nand it is only as it falls back upon ontological terms to achieve its\nend \u2014 terms generally borrowed from natural science \u2014 that\nthat element of the tremendum, originally apprehended as\n\u2018plenitude of power\u2019, becomes transmuted into\n\u2018plenitude of being\u2019\u201d (p. 21).\n\nWe can see two tendencies in Otto\u2019s thought: his striving to make the\nnuminous feeling sui generis, to protect it from\nencroachments of other spheres such as ethics and science; and his\nstriving to make it do justice to the variety of the emotions that\nactually occur in religious life. These tendencies are hard to combine\nin a consistent account, especially if the supposed encroachments of\nthe \u201cother spheres\u201d are actually native to the religion\nwhose emotions are being examined. For example, Christianity is a\nreligion whose theology is an ethics, an ethics of justice,\ntruthfulness, compassion for the poor and suffering, and of mutual\nlove in the community. In the ideal case, the emotions that are\ngenerated from thinking, caring, and acting by the standards of\nChristian theology are emotions that express ethical character.\n\nCommenting on the kind of essentialism about religious experience that\nSchleiermacher and Otto represent, William James says:\n\nConsider \u2026 the \u2018religious sentiment\u2019 which we see\nreferred to in so many books, as if it were a single sort of mental\nentity. In the psychologies and in the philosophies of religion, we\nfind the authors attempting to specify just what entity it is. One man\nallies it to the feeling of dependence; one makes it a derivative from\nfear; others connect it with the sexual life; others still identify it\nwith the feeling of the infinite; and so on. Such different ways of\nconceiving it ought of themselves to arouse doubt as to whether it\npossibly can be one specific thing; and the moment we are willing to\ntreat the term \u2018religious sentiment\u2019 as a collective name\nfor the many sentiments which religious objects may arouse in\nalternation, we see that it probably contains nothing whatever of a\npsychologically specific nature. There is religious fear, religious\nlove, religious joy, and so forth. But religious love is only man\u2019s\nnatural emotion of love directed to a religious object; religious fear\nis only the ordinary fear of commerce, so to speak, the common quaking\nof the human breast, in so far as the notion of divine retribution may\narouse it; religious awe is the same organic thrill which we feel in a\nforest at twilight, or in a mountain gorge; only this time it comes\nover us at the thought of our supernatural relations; and similarly of\nall the various sentiments which may be called into play in the lives\nof religious persons. As concrete states of mind, made up of a feeling\nplus a specific sort of object, religious emotions of course are\npsychic entities distinguishable from other concrete emotions; but\nthere is no ground of assuming a simply abstract \u2018religious\nemotion\u2019 to exist as a distinct elementary mental affection by\nitself, present in every religious experience without exception\n(The Varieties of Religious Experience, Lecture II, p. 46).\n\n\nJames here assimilates religious emotions to emotions more generally,\nand eschews the project of trying to identify some particular\nemotion-type to which every instance of religious emotion belongs and\nwhich makes it religious. But a few pages later (p. 49) he\n\u201carbitrarily\u201d for purposes of his exposition says that\nreligion is the feelings, acts, and experiences of individuals when\nthey apprehend themselves to be in the presence of the divine.\nSupposing that diversity among conceptions of the divine will engender\ndiversity among emotional experiences of the divine, and the diversity\namong types of emotions will reflect differences in ways experiences\nof the divine bear on the diverse situations of life, the Jamesian\npicture seems compatible with our brief exposition of emotions in the\nNew Testament at the beginning of this article.\n\nA question can be raised whether the famous Jamesian theory of\nemotions, referred to in this quotation, is the best account for\nunderstanding religious emotions. That theory holds that the emotion\nitself is a \u201cquaking of the human breast\u201d or an\n\u201corganic thrill,\u201d where such physiological perturbations\nare caused (aroused) by \u201cobjects.\u201d The cause of the\nquaking may be a bear approaching on the forest path, or it may be the\nthought of divine retribution. The quaking is religious just in case\nit is caused by a divine object \u2014 or at least a thought\nthereof.\n3. Some Christian emotions\n\nChristianity is the religion with which Otto and Schleiermacher are\nmost deeply concerned. Christian theology ascribes to God a variety of\nattributes, both attributed qualities and attributed actions. These\nattributes determine the type-identities of the believer\u2019s diverse\nemotions by providing, in turn, the various considerations to which\nthe emotions are diverse responses. Let us look at some examples.\n3.1 Gratitude\n\nWe may begin with the emotion that is perhaps closest to\nSchleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute dependence, that of gratitude.\nThe grateful person willingly, even gladly, acknowledges his\nindebtedness to \u2014 dependency on \u2014 a benefactor. The\ncentral sentence from the General Thanksgiving in the Book of\nCommon Prayer is,\n\nWe bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of\nthis life; but above all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption\nof the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for\nthe hope of glory (p. 19).\n\n\nThe attributes of God that especially come into play in the emotion of\ngratitude are God\u2019s creation and providence for our present life and\nGod\u2019s work of redeeming us from sin in the life, death, and\nresurrection of Jesus Christ. It is true that in this standard\nChristian gratitude the believer does not feel \u201cabsolutely\ndependent\u201d in Schleiermacher\u2019s peculiar sense of that phrase; as\nwe have seen, the feeling of absolute dependence does not allow for\nGod to have any positive attributes. But the believer\ncertainly does feel very dependent on God in the ordinary\nsense of \u2018dependent.\u2019 She construes her own existence as\nhaving not been, had God not willed and worked it. In so feeling, the\nbeliever attributes causality to God as the creator, preserver, and\nredeemer of the believer\u2019s life; and this concept of causality is not\n\u201cborrowed from natural science,\u201d as Otto suggests, but\nantedates natural science by several millennia. It is a concept of\ncausation that is embedded in the Jewish-Christian tradition. (Notice\nthat gratitude, as a construal of what God has done for us,\nalso has the Schleiermacherian property of self-consciousness.) The\nthought of these attributes of God and of God\u2019s relation to the\ngrateful party seems to be more than a Jamesian trigger or stimulus of\nsome physiological perturbation in the body of the believer. It seems\nbetter to think of it as a consideration that \u201cspeaks\u201d to the\nbeliever\u2019s concerns about the good things in her life and about the\nattitude of God toward the believer that those blessings express. No\nmention is made of physiological perturbation, nor does the \u201cfeeling\u201d\nof such figure prominently in the typical believer\u2019s experience. The\nthought seems to be internal to the emotional experience in a way that\nthought cannot be internal to a physiological sensation.\n3.2 Contrition\n\nNext, consider contrition. Again, we can get a good idea of the\nqualities and actions that this emotion attributes to God by\nconsidering a prayer from the Book of Common Prayer (in this\nemotion, much of what the believer attributes she attributes to\nherself; however, attributes of God, such as God\u2019s holiness and\nstatus as judge, and God\u2019s redeeming action, are essential posits of\nthe believer\u2019s construal):\n\nAlmighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,\nJudge of all men; we acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and\nwickedness, which we, from time to time, most grievously have\ncommitted, by thought, word, and deed, against thy Divine Majesty,\nprovoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us. We do\nearnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings; the\nremembrance of them is grievous unto us; the burden of them is\nintolerable. Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful\nFather; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ\u2019s sake, forgive us all that\nis past\u2026 (p. 73).\n\n\nThis emotion again fits very well Schleiermacher\u2019s characterization of\nreligious emotion as a \u201cself-consciousness,\u201d but it is at\nthe same time, as Otto suggests, a consciousness of a God who has\ndefinite, positive features. Salient in the consciousness of the\ncontrite person are her misdoings and her sullied moral status before\nthe divine judge. Contrary to Otto\u2019s isolation of religious experience\nfrom ethics, in contrition God is thought of as an eminently moral\nfigure. But if we take this prayer as canonical for the emotion, then\nboth the notion of God as creator (opening sentence) and Otto\u2019s\nprivileged attribute of the divine majesty are also in the believer\u2019s\nconstrual of God, though they seem to be less salient than the\nattribute of moral judge. Another attribute that is very much in the\ncontent of Christian contrition is God\u2019s mercy. Thus a serenity and\nhonesty about the grievousness and intolerable burden of sin are\ncharacteristic of contrition that are not characteristic of a plain\nfeeling of guilt. The contrite believer feels herself, in her sin, to\nbe welcomed and embraced by a loving and forgiving God, a merciful\nFather.\n3.3 Compassion\n\nThe following prayer was composed by Mother Teresa of Calcutta for\ndaily use in her Home for the Dying:\n\nDearest Lord, may I see you today and every day in the person of your\nsick, and while nursing them, minister to you.\n\n\nThough you hide yourself behind the unattractive disguise of the\nirritable, the exacting, the unreasonable, may I still recognize you,\nand say:\n\n\u201cJesus, my patient, how sweet it is to serve you.\u201d\n\nLord, give me this seeing faith, then my work will never be\nmonotonous. I will ever find joy in humoring the fancies and\ngratifying the wishes of all poor sufferers.\n\nO beloved sick, how doubly dear you are to me, when you personify\nChrist; and what a privilege is mine to be allowed to tend you.\n\nSweetest Lord, make me appreciative of the dignity of my high\nvocation, and its many responsibilities. Never permit me to disgrace\nit by giving way to coldness, unkindness, or impatience.\n\nAnd O God, while you are Jesus, my patient, deign also to be to me a\npatient Jesus, bearing with my faults, looking only to my intention,\nwhich is to love and serve you in the person of each of your sick.\n\nLord, increase my faith, bless my efforts and work, now and for\nevermore. Amen.\n\n\nNote the prevalence in this prayer of \u201ccognitive\u201d\nmetaphors in the description (prescription) of the moral emotion of\ncompassion: \u2018see,\u2019 \u2018recognize,\u2019\n\u2018appreciate.\u2019 In compassion the primary focus is on the\nsufferer \u2014 someone who is in trouble and in need of help. But as\nMother Teresa expresses the emotion in this prayer, it is very much a\nreligious emotion because of the way in which the sufferer is\nseen. She sees Christ in the sufferer, and in doing so takes herself\nto be seeing something true about the sufferer, a truth that risks\nbeing obscured by the outward repulsiveness, both sensory and\nbehavioral, of many of those to whom she ministered.\n\nThe religious character and distinctiveness of Christian compassion\ncan be brought out by comparing it with an emotion that we might call\ntragic compassion, since it is central to the ethos and teaching of\nthe Greek tragedians. Aristotle neatly summarizes the grammar of this\ncompassion:\n\nLet compassion then be a kind of pain excited by the sight of evil,\ndeadly or painful, which befalls one who does not deserve it, an evil\nwhich one might expect to come upon oneself or one of one\u2019s friends,\nand when it seems near. For it is evident that one who is likely to\nfeel pity must be such as to think that he, or one of his friends, is\nliable to suffer some evil\u2026 (The Art of Rhetoric\n1385b).\n\n\nAristotle analyses tragic compassion as involving three propositions,\nso to speak: (1) the sufferer\u2019s suffering is serious; (2) the sufferer\ndoes not deserve his suffering; 3) the sufferer\u2019s suffering is of a\nkind that could well touch me [the subject of the emotion] too (Martha\nNussbaum devotes Part II of her Upheavals of Thought to this\nemotion-type). We might say that compassion is a construal of the\nsituation \u2014 the sufferer, his suffering, the etiology of the\nsuffering, and the emotional subject\u2019s own condition compared with\nthat of the sufferer \u2014 in terms of these three formal\npropositions.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious difference between tragic compassion and\nMother Teresa\u2019s is the fact that the latter involves the proposition\nthe sufferer is a type (brother, sister, beloved) of Christ.\nThis has the implication that Christian compassion is not primarily a\n\u201ckind of pain.\u201d It is uncomfortable certainly, and the\nsubject of this compassion is moved to alleviate the suffering as she\ncan; but it is also a joy, and the work is \u201csweet,\u201d and\nthe poor sufferers are \u201cdoubly dear\u201d \u2014 dear on their\nown account and on Christ\u2019s. Mother Teresa expresses an almost erotic\nenthusiasm for the people she serves, and it is because she loves\nChrist above all. The prayer exudes not just compassion, but also\ngratitude and devotion, and the compassion derives its character in\npart from these other emotions, which in turn have their character\nbecause of the belief-system in which Mother Teresa lives.\n\nAn equally significant departure from the grammar of tragic compassion\nis the denial of the necessity of proposition 2) the sufferer does\nnot deserve his suffering. This denial comes out in one of the\nparadigm texts for Christian compassion, the Parable of the Prodigal\nSon in Luke 15.11\u201332. The younger of two sons asks his father\nfor his share of the inheritance ahead of time, and the son takes the\nmoney and goes abroad where he \u201csquander[s] his property in\nloose living\u201d (vs. 13). When the money is depleted a famine\ndescends on his country of residence, and he is destitute. He gets a\njob feeding pigs, and is miserable and hungry. He has the bright idea\nof returning to his father in the role of a common laborer on the home\nfarm.\n\nAnd he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a\ndistance, his father saw him and had compassion\n(esplanchnisth\u0113), and ran and embraced him and kissed\nhim. And the son said to him, \u201cFather, I have sinned against\nheaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son;\ntreat me as one of your hired servants.\u201d But the father said to\nhis servants, \u201cBring quickly the best robe, and put it on him;\nand put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring the\nfatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; for this my\nson was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.\u201d\nAnd they began to make merry (vss 20\u201324).\n\n\nThe father can hardly be ignorant of the proposition my son\ndeserves this suffering that he has brought on himself; and the\nson himself dins the proposition into his father\u2019s head. But the\nfather\u2019s compassion is unaffected by the knowledge. The father in the\nparable is of course God, whose nature as gracious and forgiving is\nindicated in the parable. So Mother Teresa, unlike the characters in\nthe Greek tragedies, is not interested in the question whether the\nsufferer brought his woes on himself through his choices. It is this\ngracious and forgiving God whose Son Mother Teresa sees and loves in\neach of her poor sufferers.\n\nAs to the third proposition, the Christian would no doubt generally\nacknowledge it, but it seems to figure differently in Christian than\nin tragic compassion. It does not seem to be a major consideration in\nMother Teresa\u2019s compassion that the same thing might happen to her as\nhas happened to her poor sufferers. The difference turns on the phrase\n\u201cmight happen.\u201d It is part of Mother Teresa\u2019s spiritual\ndiscipline \u2014 her self-cultivation in the Christian emotions\n\u2014 that she deliberately puts herself, as much as practicable, in\nthe position of those she ministers to. Early in her ministry she had\nto be persuaded to provide herself and her fellow nuns a bit\nmore food than the average Calcutta street person consumed, so as to\nmaintain her health well enough to continue her ministry. In this\naspiration to identify with sufferers she imitates Christ, who lowered\nhimself to the status of a servant and died the death of a criminal,\nout of compassion for humanity. In the nervous \u201cit might happen\nto me too\u201d of tragic compassion there is an aloofness from the\nsufferer and his suffering that is absent in the most paradigmatic\nexemplars of Christian compassion.\n\nChristian compassion, like contrition and gratitude, does have an\nelement faintly reminiscent of Schleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute\ndependence. And again, it comes from the gratitude that is in the near\nvicinity of compassion. Unlike the subject of tragic compassion, the\nsubject of Christian compassion construes herself as having been first\nthe object of God\u2019s compassion. One might say that Mother Teresa\u2019s\ncompassion towards poor sufferers springs from her gratitude to Christ\nfor his compassion towards her and all humankind. But the reminiscence\nis only faint. Gratitude is not what Schleiermacher calls the feeling\nof absolute dependence. Indeed, the feeling of absolute dependence\ndoes not seem to be the essence of any of the Christian emotions.\nRudolf Otto\u2019s stress on fear (tremor) or blank wonder\n(stupor) also seems not to express the essence of Christian\ncompassion. Christian doctrine does teach that God is fearsome and\nwonderful, but other attributes of God are much more to the fore in\nthe emotion of compassion: God\u2019s fatherly nurturing tenderness and\nforgiveness, his long-suffering love. William James\u2019s critique of the\nessentialist tendency in the religious philosophy of the emotions\nseems on target: God has a variety of attributes, and these are\nreflected in a variety of emotion-types, none of which has any more\nclaim than the others to constitute the essence of religious emotion.\nThe diverse emotion types have in common that their grammar makes\nreference to God, but the attributes of God that they cite vary with\nthe emotion types.\n\nOtto states that the response to the mysterium tremendum is\nnot necessarily moral and explains this by saying that the emotion\ndoes not necessarily posit God as a moral judge or law-giver. But\ncompassion does seem to be necessarily moral, though it is true that\nthe idea of God as judge or law-giver is not particularly in the\npicture. The moral attribute of God that is quite directly posited by\nthe emotion is that of mercy or compassion. The sufferer is construed\nas one with whom Christ has identified and for whom Christ has\nsuffered. The other two emotions that we have looked at are also\nessentially moral: contrition is a construal of oneself as morally at\nfault and spoiled, and here the idea of God as judge is involved; and\ngratitude, as a construal of oneself as indebted for a gift, has\nreference to a kind of justice (though it is clearly not standard\nretributive justice [see Roberts 2004]).\n4. Are religious emotions \u201ccognitive\u201d?\n\nBoth Schleiermacher and Otto hold that the most basic religious\nemotions are unsusceptible of propositional definition. Yet both\ntheologians specify, in propositions, the object of the religious\nemotion in question. Our accounts of gratitude, contrition, and\ncompassion have likewise treated the emotions as having a\npropositional structure, one deriving from the teachings of the\nChristian tradition. Let us think for a moment about the sense in\nwhich these emotions are and are not propositional. The Christian\nemotions are given their distinctive character by their doctrinal\ncontent: The three cited prayers expressive of the distinctively\nChristian emotions all trade on propositional beliefs of the kind that\nthe Christian community routinely teaches its members in catechesis.\nThe situation of the emotional subject is then seen (felt) in terms of\nthe teaching; for example, the sufferer on whom the subject has\ncompassion is seen as one for whom Christ died; the object of\ngratitude is seen as a gift from the hand of God; and so forth. The\nparticular character of each religious emotion-type would be\nimpossible apart from this doctrinal content. This is the sense in\nwhich the Christian emotions are propositional. But still, the\nemotions themselves escape reduction to their propositional content\nbecause emotions are a sort of concern-based impression or\nperception or construal of the situation in these\nterms. Emotions transcend propositionality in the same way that any\nactual perception (e.g. visual perception) does. A Rembrandt painting\ncan be truly characterized in many propositions, and in individual\ncases some of the propositions may need to be made explicit as a\ncondition for seeing some things that are in the painting. But no\namount of discourse or discursive thought about the content of the\npainting is a substitute for seeing the painting. This\nimmediate acquaintance with the canvas is analogous to the actual\nhaving of the emotion (religious or otherwise). (For more on the view\nof emotions taken here, see Roberts 2013, chapters 3\u20135; for an\nexcellent discussion of the relationship between religious feelings\nand religious doctrines, see Wynn, 2004, especially chapter 5. For\nmore, and more extended, accounts of particular religious emotions,\nsee Roberts 2007.) So religious emotions are no less propositional\nthan other standard adult human emotions; and like the other emotions,\nthey cannot be reduced to their propositional content.\n\nWhen James says that the religious emotions are just like all other\nemotions in being \u201cmade up of a feeling plus a specific sort of\nobject,\u201d the specific sort of object is just the situational\nobject specified in propositional terms such as the examples in this\narticle have illustrated. But the peculiarity of the Jamesian theory\ncomes in the reference to \u201ca feeling.\u201d The feeling he\nrefers to (1884) is a bodily sensation, which he takes to be the\nelement that makes the mental state into an emotion, and is a\n\u201cquaking of the human breast,\u201d an \u201corganic\nthrill,\u201d or the like. This account of affect seems to many\nto fail to capture the meaning that the object has for the subject\n\u2013 meaning that is conveyed through the emotion. Schleiermacher,\nwith his talk of feeling dependent, and Otto, with his talk of awesome\nmystery, are closer to capturing the kind of affect in question. A\nsensation of quaking or a contraction of the gut are not the same kind\nof thing as the sense that the sufferer before one is a brother for\nwhom Christ died, or that one\u2019s sins are an intolerable burden. There\nmay indeed be organic thrill or quaking, but if so, such sensations\nare incorporated into a perception of personal meaning wrought by the\nsubject\u2019s caring about the object.\n\nJesse Prinz (2004) tries to introduce correct intentionality into the\nJamesian idea that emotional experience is awareness of a gut reaction\nby making the gut reaction indicate the instantiation of a \u201ccore\nrelational theme\u201d. The notion of a core relational theme, which\noriginates with Richard S. Lazarus (1993), is the idea of a way that\nbenefit or harm is mediated to the emotional subject from the\nenvironment. Lazarus gives a list of 15 core relational themes (see\n1993 p. 122), among which are a demeaning offense against me and\nmine (anger), facing uncertain, existential threat\n(anxiety), and having failed to live up to an ego-ideal\n(shame). Such themes seem to be types of events or states of affairs\nthat impinge on some concern of the subject. Prinz envisions the\nsequence that characterizes an emotion episode as follows: An\neliciting event triggers a thought (say, Aaron tells me that my real\nfather is not the man I have taken him all my life to be, but the\nFuller brush man who used to visit the house; which triggers a\ncharacteristic reaction in my gut; which triggers my perception of the\nreaction in my gut; which I read as indicating a core relational\ntheme, namely, a demeaning offense against me and mine; which\ntriggers my socking Aaron in the jaw. But why would the identification\nof my father with the Fuller brush man trigger that reaction in my gut\n(which is characteristic of anger), unless I already heard it as a\ndemeaning offense against me and mine? Prinz\u2019s construction seems to\nmisplace the gut reaction in the emotional process. The gut reaction\nseems, rather, to presuppose some emotional awareness of the\ncore relational theme, which gives rise to the gut reaction (for\ndiscussion, see Roberts 2013, 73\u201375).\n\nMark Wynn (2013, 27\u201333) points out that in James\u2019s\ndiscussion of religious emotion, it is not the gut reaction that is\nprimarily felt, but a sensory awareness of \u201cthe world\u201d\nunder a certain description. In other words, religious feelings are\ninstances of what Peter Goldie (2000) calls\n\u201cfeeling-towards\u201d. And in still other words, the James\nof The Varieties of Religious Experience isn\u2019t a\nJamesian in the standard sense. As Wynn points out, it doesn\u2019t\nfollow from religious emotions\u2019 not being primarily gut\nreactions that gut reactions are not involved in their phenomenology;\nbut their involvement would be in the nature of a feedback loop or\nintegrated non-focal awareness. I would also add that, while gut\nsensations are frequently included in the phenomenology of emotions,\nthey may not be necessary or universal.  James himself, in a\npostscript to his 1884 article, cites the case of a 15-year-old\nshoemaker\u2019s apprentice who, being entirely without bodily\nsensations (though otherwise aware of the world around him),\nnevertheless exhibited shame, grief, fear, and anger, as his situation\nwarranted. In acknowledgment of the possibility of emotions without\nbodily sensations, the Jamesian neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (1994)\nposits the existence of an \u201cas-if\u201d bodily feedback loop in\nthe brain to provide for the \u201csomatic markers\u201d required,\non the theory, by emotions.\n5. The importance of religious emotions\n\nThe foregoing helps us to answer the question about the importance of\nreligious emotions. Aristotle points out that the character virtues\nare dispositions of the appetitive (desiring, caring) part of the soul\nas shaped by logos (see Nicomachean Ethics, Book\nOne, Chapter 13). The three Christian emotions used as examples in\nthis article are episodes that arise out of dispositions of caring\nshaped by beliefs (each of the emotion-types gives its name to a\nChristian virtue). The episodes are important, from the viewpoint of\nthe Christian tradition, because they express a character that is\nattuned to the way things are: to our nature as creatures, to God\u2019s\nnature as God, to the relations we bear to the goods and evils of\nlife. In an article titled \u201cWhy Christianity Works: An\nEmotion-Focused Phenomenological Account,\u201d Christian Smith\nappeals to the character of religious emotions in explaining the\ntenacity of Christianity in the face of various secularizing\ninfluences.\n\nAs dispositions of caring, the virtues of gratitude, contrition, and\ncompassion have the value of motivating appropriate actions: acts of\nthat special gracious justice that is an appropriate response to gifts\nand their givers, acts of self-correction and atonement for wrongs\ncommitted, and acts of helping those who suffer. As dispositions of\nperception, these virtues have the value of putting their possessor in\ndirect perceptual acquaintance with moral aspects of reality: her\nindebtedness for gifts, the evil of her actions and the forgiveness of\nGod, and the distress of her fellows and the relation of that distress\nto the life of Christ. And the emotions themselves are the episodes in\nwhich these motives and perceptions are particularized to the concrete\ncircumstances of daily life.\n\nSo one epistemic value of Christian emotions is that of bringing the\nsubject into perceptual acquaintance with truths as the religious\ntradition conceives them. Another potential epistemic value is that of\nproviding evidence for those purported truths. The more concretely one\ntreats the religious emotions \u2014 moving in the direction of James\nand away from Schleiermacher and Otto, as this article has done\n\u2014 the less evidential value the religious emotions have. The\nreason is that the perceptions are so shaped by the propositions that\nthey might be called upon to provide evidence for, that the\n\u201cevidence\u201d is undercut by circularity.\n\nSo the value that the particular religious emotion-types have for\nadherents of any particular religious tradition is very great. They\nare a sine qua non for genuine adherence to the tradition,\nand the degree to which they are actual in the life of any adherent is\nan index of the depth with which that adherent represents his or her\ntradition and is a successful human specimen by its lights. No wonder,\nthen, that one strand of philosophical reflection about religious\nemotions, differing even more from the Schleiermacher-Otto and James\naxes than these differ from each other, is self-consciously\ncriteriological or regulative. Clarificatory reflection about\nreligious emotions serves a purpose of buffering the tradition against\nthe demoralizing corrosions of the spirit of the age. One thinks of\nthe work of Jonathan Edwards and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. (See the\nentry on\n S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.)\n6. Criteriological work on religious emotions\n\nIn a book that Kierkegaard didn\u2019t publish but rewrote many times\n(On Authority and Revelation), he reflected about the case of\na Hegelian pastor, a certain Adolph Peter Adler, who claimed to have\nhad a revelation from Jesus Christ. By comparison with most of his\ncontemporaries in the Danish Lutheran Church, Adler was a man of\nstrong religious passion / feeling, and Kierkegaard respected him for\nthat. But he also noted that Adler\u2019s religious emotion was entirely\ngeneric, having no just claim to be especially Christian. Adler\u2019s\nemotion was not Christian emotion because it did not show the\ndistinctive conceptual marks.\n\n\u2026it was Magister Adler\u2019s advantage that he was deeply moved,\nshaken in his inmost being\u2026. But to be thus profoundly moved is\na very indefinite expression for something so concrete as Christian\nawakening or conversion \u2026 emotion (Grebethed) which is\nChristian is checked by the definition of concepts \u2026 to express\noneself Christianly there is required, besides the more universal\nlanguage of the heart, also skill and schooling in the definition of\nChristian concepts, while at the same time\u2026the emotion is of a\nspecific, qualitative sort, the Christian emotion (pp. 163, 164).\n\n\nKierkegaard goes on to point out that using the distinctively\nChristian terms is no guarantee that the emotions themselves will\ndisplay the Christian conceptual structure, because such terms as\n\u2018sin,\u2019 \u2018redemption,\u2019\n\u2018forgiveness,\u2019 and \u2018Holy Spirit,\u2019 have\n\u201cbecome in a volatilized sense the conversational language of\nthe whole of Europe\u201d (p. 166). In other words, the terms are\nused in a different sense from the one they have in original\nChristianity, because they have been dissociated from Christian\nthought and practice.\n\nA major aim of Kierkegaard\u2019s writings as a philosopher (or\n\u201cdialectician\u201d as he usually describes himself) is to\noffer analyses of emotion concepts (which are at the same time virtue\nconcepts) that can function in a regulative or criteriological way.\nThat is, they specify the conceptual shape of these emotions when they\nare authentically Christian. The analyses are written in a richly\nliterary way (for besides being a \u201cdialectician,\u201d\nKierkegaard is, as he says, a \u201cpoet\u201d), and this is\nimportant for Kierkegaard\u2019s regulative purpose, since he aims not just\nto inform people about the logic of religious emotions, but to move\nthem to see the world in their terms and to take action in their\nterms. Examples of such emotion-regulative discourse are the\nfollowing: Works of Love about the virtue of love; \u201cThe\nExpectancy of Faith\u201d, \u201cPatience in Expectancy\u201d, and\n\u201cThe Expectancy of an Eternal Salvation\u201d, all about the\nvirtue of hope and found in Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses;\n\u201cEvery Good and Every Perfect Gift Is from Above\u201d and\n\u201cOne Who Prays Aright Struggles in Prayer and Is Victorious\n\u2014 in That God Is Victorious\u201d about the virtue of gratitude\nand also in Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses; \u201cOn the\nOccasion of a Confession: Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing\u201d\nabout contrition and found in Upbuilding Discourses in Various\nSpirits; and the discourses in Part Three of the same book, which\nare all about joy. These are just a few of many examples of religious\nemotion-regulative thought in Kierkegaard\u2019s writings.\n\nAnother well-known author whose work on religious emotions is\nregulative is Jonathan Edwards. In A Treatise Concerning Religious\nAffections, Edwards aims to correct both a passionless\nChristianity and a revivalist \u201centhusiasm\u201d that confuses\nemotional intensity with the work of the Holy Spirit. Edwards begins\nby discussing the nature and importance of emotions in the Christian\nlife, and then turns to a systematic treatment of twenty-four supposed\n\u201csigns\u201d or criteria for the genuineness of religious\nemotions. The first twelve signs turn out not to be genuine criteria:\nThey do not rule out the emotion\u2019s being a work of the Spirit, but\nneither are they specific marks of it. Thus, for example, a person\u2019s\nemotions in a revival meeting might be extremely intense (sign 1), or\nattended by great bodily perturbations (sign 2), or might dispose the\nsubject to talk volubly about religion (sign 3), but these marks show\nnothing one way or the other about the Christian character of the\naffection.\n\nEdwards then turns to the twelve signs that do indicate the gracious\nwork of the Spirit in the believer\u2019s life. Sign 5 is that one\u2019s\nemotions involve an immediate conviction that the great things of the\ngospel are true, and sign 6, \u201cevangelical humiliation,\u201d is\na strong disinclination to judge oneself better than others or to\nbelieve that one\u2019s spiritual attainments entitle one to some claim on\nGod. Sign 12 is Christian practice: affections that dissipate\nthemselves in excitement and feelings without leading to Christian\naction are bogus; genuine spiritual affections motivate characteristic\nChristian action. Sign 7 is that such action is persistent: genuine\nspiritual affections signal a lasting change of character. Edwards\nendorses the signs not as criteria by which to discern how well one\u2019s\nneighbor measures up in the kingdom of God, but as criteria to be used\nin self-examination and self-discipline.\n\nKierkegaard and Edwards agree that religious emotions are diverse,\nthat they embody religious teachings, that they are important\nepistemic and ethical indicators of character, and that in consequence\nthere are conceptual criteria for their rightness that can and should\nbe carefully clarified.\n7. Conclusion\n\nJames seems to be right in claiming that there is no\nemotion type that is distinctive of religion as such. Religious\nemotions come in the usual types \u2014 contrition, gratitude, joy,\nfear, anxiety, anger, and so forth \u2014 and what makes them\ndistinctive of one religion or another is their shaping by the\nteachings of the religion about God or the transcendent. Emotions are\nimportant to adherents of a religion because, like the actions that\nthey sometimes motivate, they are expressions of the moral and\nspiritual life enjoined by the religion. They constitute an important\npart of the substance of the religious life. For this reason, teachers\nof the religion, as guardians and regulators of the life in question,\nsometimes formulate criteria of genuineness of religious emotions.\n",
