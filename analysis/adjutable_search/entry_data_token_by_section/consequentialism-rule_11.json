    "main_text": "Must Rule-consequentialism Be Guilty of Collapse, Incoherence, or Rule-worship?\n9. Other Objections to Rule-consequentialism\n\nFrom the mid 1960s until the mid 1990s, most philosophers thought\nrule-consequentialism couldn\u2019t survive the objections discussed\nin the previous section. So, during those three decades, most\nphilosophers didn\u2019t bother with other objections to the theory.\nHowever, if rule-consequentialism has convincing replies to all three\nof the objections just discussed, then a good question is whether or\nnot there are other fatal objections to the theory.\n\nSome other objections try to show that, given the theory\u2019s\ncriterion for selecting rules, there are conditions under which it\nselects intuitively unacceptable rules. For example, Tom Carson (1991)\nargued that rule-consequentialism turns out to be extremely demanding\nin the real world. Mulgan (2001, esp. ch. 3) agreed with Carson about\nthat, and went on to argue that, even if rule-consequentialism\u2019s\nimplications in the actual world are fine, the theory has\ncounterintuitive implications in possible worlds. If Mulgan were right\nabout that, this would cast doubt on rule-consequentialism\u2019s\nclaim to explain why certain demands are appropriate in the actual\nworld. Debate about such matters continues (Hooker 2003; Lawlor 2004;\nParfit 2011, 2017a, 2017b; Woollard 2015: 181\u2013205; Rajczi 2016;\nPortmore 2017; Podgorski 2018; D. Miller 2021; Perl 2021, 2022). And\nMulgan has become a developer of rule-consequentialism rather than a\ncritic (Mulgan 2006, 2009, 2015, 2017, 2020).\n\nA related objection to rule-consequentialism is that\nrule-consequentialism makes the justification of familiar rules\ncontingent on various empirical facts, such as what human nature is\nlike, and how many people there are in need or in positions to help.\nThe objection to rule-consequentialism is that some familiar moral\nrules are necessarily, not merely contingently, justified (McNaughton\nand Rawling 1998; Gaut 1999, 2002; Montague 2000; Suikkanen 2008). A\nsibling of this objection is that rule-consequentialism makes the\njustification of rules depend on the wrong facts (Arneson 2005;\nPortmore 2009; cf. Woollard 2015: esp. pp. 185\u201386,\n203\u2013205; 2022).\n\nThe mechanics of teaching new codes throws up serious questions for\nforms of rule-consequentialism that count the costs of getting rules\ninternalised by new generations. As explained earlier, limiting the\ntargets of the teaching to new generations is meant to avoid having to\ncount the costs of getting rules internalised by existing generations\nof people who have already internalised some other moral rules and\nideas. But can we come up with a coherent description of those who are\nsupposed to do the teaching of these new generations? If the teachers\nare imagined to have already internalised the ideal code themselves,\nthen how is that supposed to have happened? If these teachers are\nimagined not to have already internalised the ideal code, then there\nwill be costs associated with the conflict between the ideal code and\nwhatever they have already internalised. (This objection was\nformulated by John Andrews, Robert Ehman, and Andrew Moore. Cf. Levy\n2000; D. Miller, 2021.) A related objection is that\nrule-consequentialism has not yet been formulated in a way that\nenables it to deal plausibly with conflicts among rules (Eggleston\n2007). But see Copp 2020; D. Miller 2021; Woodard 2022.\n",
