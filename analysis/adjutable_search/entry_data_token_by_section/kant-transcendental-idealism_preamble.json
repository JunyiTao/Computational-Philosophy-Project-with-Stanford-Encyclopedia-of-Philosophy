    "main_text": "\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason Kant argues that space and\ntime are merely formal features of how we perceive objects, not things\nin themselves that exist independently of us, or properties or\nrelations among them. Objects in space and time are said to be\n\u201cappearances\u201d, and he argues that we know nothing of\nsubstance about the things in themselves of which they are\nappearances. Kant calls this doctrine (or set of doctrines)\n\u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d, and ever since the publication\nof the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781,\nKant\u2019s readers have wondered, and debated, what exactly\ntranscendental idealism is, and have developed quite different\ninterpretations. Some, including many of Kant\u2019s contemporaries,\ninterpret transcendental idealism as essentially a form of\nphenomenalism, similar in some respects to that of Berkeley, while\nothers think that it is not a metaphysical or ontological theory at\nall. There is probably no major interpretive question in Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy on which there is so little consensus. This entry provides\nan introduction to the most important Kantian texts, as well as the\ninterpretive and philosophical issues surrounding them.\n",
