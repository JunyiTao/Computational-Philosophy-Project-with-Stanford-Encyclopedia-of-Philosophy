    "main_text": "Truth Commissions || Historical Background\n3.1 Historical Background\n\n\nThe structural and political shortcomings of war crime trials, as\noutlined in the previous section, have led policy makers in war torn\ncountries to turn to other measures of transitional justice. The most\nimportant among these is the non-judicial truth commission.\n\n\nPriscilla Hayner (2002), in her landmark book on truth commissions,\nenumerates four characteristics typical of these bodies:\n\nThey deal with the past\nThey investigate continued patterns of abuses and not specific cases \nThey operate for up to two years and then submit reports\nsummarizing their findings and, \nThey are usually official bodies sanctioned by the state.\n\n These commissions, Hayner continues, most often have some or all\nof the following goals: unearthing, clarifying and formally\nacknowledging past abuses, responding to the needs of victims, helping\ncreate a culture of accountability, outlining institutional\nresponsibility and possible reforms, advancing the prospects of\nreconciliation and reducing conflict over the past (Hayner 2002:\n24).\n\n\nWhile truth commissions have fewer coercive powers than courts (they\ncannot compel governments to carry out their recommendations, they\nhave no authority to punish etc.), their mandate for investigating the\nbroader pattern of abuses, and their tendency to put the victims at\nthe center of their proceeding, gives these bodies a great degree of\nmoral credibility and legitimacy.\n\n\nThe work of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission\n(hereafter TRC) has sparked a great deal of interest in the use of\ntruth commissions after war. The celebrity of its chair, Desmond Tutu,\nthe massive scale of the public hearings it held, the intensive media\ncoverage, and its controversial amnesty-for-truth mechanism, generated\na great deal of international curiosity. Ever since the TRC completed\nits hearings and published its report, nations facing a transition to\ndemocracy have consistently asked themselves whether they too should\nuse truth commissions to confront past abuses. Some scholars even go\nso far as to say that the truth commission has now replaced criminal\nprosecution as the most important norm of international justice (see,\nfor example, Ben-Josef Hirsch 2007).\n\n\nWhile the TRC has become paradigmatic of truth commissions, it is\nworthwhile noting that it was not the first such body. Argentina,\nChile, and El Salvador all employed relatively effective truth\ncommissions during the 1980's and early\n 1990's.[23]\n\n\n\nThese efforts provided both inspiration and valuable lessons for the\ndesigners of the South African\n body.[24]\n\n\n\nIn Argentina, a truth commission was set up to investigate the abuses\ncommitted by the military junta during the country's \u201cdirty\nwar\u201d (1976\u20131983). It is estimated that up to 30,000\nsuspected \u201csubversives\u201d were\n\u201cdisappeared\u201d\u2014abducted, tortured and disposed of\nsecretly\u2014by security forces during those years. Unlike the South\nAfrican TRC, the Argentinean body, officially named \u201cNational\nCommission on the Disappearance of Persons\u201d, did not hold public\nhearings. The commission also lacked the authority and incentive\nstructure to compel cooperation from the military. And yet, it was\nable to produce a substantive report. More than 7000 statements were\ntaken, 1500 of which were given by survivors of military detention\ncamps. The commission focused on locating and exposing military\ndetention and torture centers. Much of the evidence it gathered was\nhanded over to prosecutors, eventually aiding in the convictions of\nseveral high-ranking officers. The truth commission's report, titled\nNever Again (Nunca M\u00e1s), was published in 1984 and\nhas become one of the best-selling books in Argentinean history.\n\n\nSeven years later, Chile's National Commission on Truth and\nReconciliation published a report documenting human rights abuses\ncommitted by the Chilean army during General Augusto Pinochet's\n17-year reign. As in Argentina, Chile's security forces practiced\nroutine torture, abductions and extrajudicial executions. The abuses\nwere especially severe in the first few years of the dictatorship. In\n1978 Pinochet issued a sweeping amnesty order, protecting all members\nof the security forces. This amnesty created a complex constitutional\nenvironment for the truth commission. The commission, chaired by\nformer senator Raul Retting, consisted of an equal number of Pinochet\nsupporters and critics. Its mandate was defined in relatively narrow\nterms, focusing on executions, disappearances and cases of torture\nthat resulted in death (leaving out a large number of torture\nsurvivors).  Like its Argentinean counterpart, the commission had no\nway to compel members of the security forces to testify. The\nCommissioners looked into 3400 cases and issued an 1800 page report in\nFebruary of 1991 strongly (and, significantly, unanimously) condemning\nPinochet and his generals. The impact of the report was weakened by a\nseries of armed attacks carried out by left leaning militants shortly\nafter its publication. In spite of the limited public attention it\nreceived at the time, the report was instrumental in creating a\nreparations program for the relatives of Pinochet's victims. The\ncommission's work was also useful in providing evidence to support the\nSpanish extradition request that eventually led to Pinochet's arrest\nin Britain. Pinochet was later returned to Chile, and died before he\ncould be convicted of any crimes.\n El Salvador's truth commission was probably the least successful\nof the three. The commission was created to investigate abuses carried\nout in the course of the civil war between government forces and FMLN\nguerrillas. According to some estimates, the 12-year war\n(1980\u20131992) claimed the lives of 75,000 citizens. As in\nArgentina and Chile, the military engaged in executions, torture, and\nabductions, in addition to large-scale massacres. The El Salvadorian\ncommission operated for 8 months. Appointed by the Secretary General\nof the United Nations, its members included former Colombian President\nBelisario Betancur, former President of the Inter American Court of\nHuman Rights Thomas Buergenthal, and former Minister of Foreign\nAffairs of Venezuela Reinaldo Figueredo Planchart. The animosity and\ndiffidence between the former combatants was such that no Salvadorians\nwere allowed to serve as commissioners.\n The commission gathered testimony on more than 7000 cases of\nsevere human rights violations. Its final report, titled \u201cFrom\nMadness to Hope\u201d, outlined a set of harsh conclusions against 40\ngovernment and military officials and stated that the vast majority of\natrocities had been committed by government backed security forces\n(rather than by FMLN fighters). Very shortly after the report's\npublication, a national amnesty law was passed, rendering many of the\ncommission's recommendations irrelevant. However, the report was\nhelpful in shaming and eventually removing from service some of the\nmilitary officials accused of especially egregious abuses.\n\n\nThree years after the release of El Salvador's report, On April 15,\n1996, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the head of South Africa's Anglican\nChurch, addressed a crowd gathered at East London's city hall. \n\nWe are charged to unearth the truth about our dark past,\n\n he told his listeners,\n and to lay the ghosts of that past to rest so that\nthey will not return to haunt us; and that we will thereby contribute\nto the healing of the traumatized and the wounded\u2014for all of us\nin South Africa are wounded people. (Meredith 1999:\n3)\n\n  Thus began South Africa's controversial experiment in transitional\n \n justice.[25]\n\n\n\nAs they debated how to manage the transition from apartheid,\nnegotiators on behalf of the African National Congress (hereafter ANC)\nand the outgoing National Party clashed repeatedly on the question of\nhow to address human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era.\nIn the negotiations leading up to the 1993 interim constitution, which\nlaid down the terms of the transition, the most contentious issue\nconcerned the question of amnesty. After a great deal of wrangling,\nthe two sides agreed to add a postamble to the constitution containing\nthe following language:\n in order to advance\u2026 reconciliation and\nreconstruction, amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts,\nomissions, and offenses associated with political objectives and\ncommitted in the course of the conflicts of the past.\u201d\n(Postamble to South Africa's Interim Constitution of 1993 as quoted in\nMeredith 1999: 20\u201321)\n Many ANC supporters, who wanted to see apartheid officials brought\nbefore Nuremberg style war crime tribunals, were understandably upset\nby the arrangement. Nelson Mandela, who insisted on the importance of\nsteering clear of \u201cvictors' justice\u201d, remained adamant\nabout the need for some kind of accountability for apartheid's\ncrimes. Without such reckoning, he threatened, the unaddressed\natrocities of the past would live with South Africans like a\n\u201cfestering sore\u201d (Meredith 1999: 18).\n The convergence between these two commitments\u2014to amnesty on\nthe one hand and to accountability on the other\u2014was to result in\nthe establishment of the TRC.\n\n\nThe process that led to the commission's creation was characterized by\nan unprecedented degree of transparency and public participation.\nDuring 1994, two major conferences were held to lay the groundwork for\nthe TRC's work. Both were organized by Alex Boraine, an Anti-Apartheid\nactivist who served as president of the South African Methodist\nChurch, MP for the progressive party, and the director of important\ncivil society NGOs. The first of these conferences focused on the\nlessons of political transitions in Latin America and Eastern Europe\n(Proceedings were published in Boraine et al. 1994).  The second\nsolicited input from stakeholders inside South Africa (Proceedings\nwere published in Boraine et al. 1995).  After the conferences, South\nAfrica's parliament began deliberating on the National Unity and\nReconciliation Act, which would set up the commission. The\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Justice held extended public\nhearings asking individuals, political parties and NGOs for their\nadvice on the design of the TRC. The law was finally passed, after a\ngreat deal of bickering and debate, in May of 1995, a year or so after\nit was first presented. The TRC thus became the first commission of\nits kind to be created through a parliamentary process rather than\nexecutive\n decree.[26]\n Whether by design or inertia, this open,\ndeliberative approach was also applied to the selection of commission\nmembers. Nominees were suggested by NGOs, churches, and political\nparties, and were then interviewed in public by the selection\ncommittee. Finally, the cabinet and president chose the commissioners\nfrom a short list.\n\n\nThe Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act set the\nfollowing three goals for the commission:\n to develop a complete picture of the gross violations\nof human rights that took place in and came through the conflicts of\nthe past; to restore to victims their human and civil dignity by\nletting them tell their stories and recommending how they could be\nassisted; and to consider granting amnesty to those perpetrators who\ncarried out their abuses for political reasons and who gave full\naccountings to their actions to the commission. (Graybill 2002:\n6).\n\n\nThe commission would respect the ANC's promise to offer amnesties, but\nthe reprieve would not be granted automatically. It would, rather, be\nlinked to a demand for full disclosure from perpetrators. Those\nseeking amnesty would have to apply for it, provide full details about\nwhat they had done, and establish that their activities were\npolitically motivated (rather than the result of greed,\n sadism\netc.).[27]\n\nApplicants would not, however, be required to apologize or otherwise\nexpress regret.  Furthermore, the arrangement would eliminate not only\ncriminal responsibility but also civil\n liability.[28]\n Successful\napplicants could be neither charged nor sued for their conduct during\nthe apartheid years. The commission would be charged with\ninvestigating abuses that took place between March 1, 1960 and May 10,\n1994.\n\n\nThe commission was divided into three committees in order to realize\nthe aims set out by the law: the committee on human rights violations,\nthe committee on amnesty, and the committee on reparation and\nrehabilitation. The first would collect testimony and conduct public\nhearings regarding the abuses. The second would consider applications\nfor amnesty from members of the security forces and ANC, and determine\nwhether the acts in question were committed in a political context and\nwhether applicants had provided full disclosure about them. The third\nwould come up with recommendations and criteria for whom to compensate\nand how.\n\n\nThe TRC's authority and resources were unprecedented in the history of\ntruth commissions. It had the power to subpoena witnesses and the\nauthority to order searches and seizures. It had a witness protection\nprogram, 300 staff members, and an annual budget of 18 million\ndollars.  Its proceedings were broadcast on a daily basis on both\nradio and television, and were widely covered by the printed\npress. During the course of its tenure, the commission took testimony\nfrom more than 22,000 victims and witnesses, hearing upwards of 2,000\nof them in public.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the main controversy surrounding the commission's work\nconcerned its amnesty-granting powers. The opportunity afforded to\nperpetrators of egregious human rights abuses to walk away from\nprosecution enraged many black South Africans who wanted to see those\nwho had tormented them and their families put behind bars. As far as\nmany blacks were concerned, the TRC allowed some of apartheid's worst\noffenders to \u201cget away with\n murder.\u201d[29]\n As Martin Meredith\n(1999: 315) puts it in his superb survey of the commission's\ntenure:\n \u2026the work of the TRC provoked\u2026anger in\nparts of the black community\u2026particularly over the way security\nforce operatives responsible for heinous crimes were given freedom in\nexchange for a bit of truth telling, while victims and their families\nwere denied access to the courts. What many wanted more than truth was\njustice\u2014prosecution in the courts and prison\nsentences.\n\n Many academic observers of South Africa's transition were dismayed as\n well, remarking that neither political necessity nor the attempt to\n create social solidarity can justify the kind of sacrifices of\n retributive justice the TRC's work entailed.\n\n\nThe outrage is more than understandable, when one considers cases like\nthat of Vlakplass commander Dirk Coetzee who testified to killing ANC\nactivist Sizwe Kondile and burning his body on an open bonfire.\nCoetzee and his men stood by, drinking beers and smoking for more than\nseven hours, until nothing remained of Kondile. The sight of such a\nman walking away from his testimony cannot but turn one's stomach.\n The international community has continued to experiment with truth\ncommissions as a means to achieve transitional justice. On July 13,\n2001, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor\n(UNTAET) established the Commission for Reception, Truth, and\nReconciliation (CRTR). The purpose of this commission is to promote\n\u201cnational reconciliation and healing\u201d after decades of\npolitical conflict following the 1975 invasion and subsequent\noccupation of East Timor by Indonesia.\n\n\nFollowing a failed attempt to annex East Timor in 1999,\nIndonesia-supported militants are suspected of killing over 1,000\nsupporters of an independent East Timor and caused hundreds of\nthousands of civilians to flee their homes (Stahn 2001).\n\n\nIn 2011, Brazil also created a truth commission to investigate and\npublicize human rights abuses that occurred during the rule of\nBrazil's military dictatorship from 1964\u20131985. The seven-person\ncommission was provided with a two-year mandate to investigate human\nrights abuses and to compile a file report to be released publicly.\nHowever, doubts regarding the truth commission remain as a result of a\n1979 law that provided amnesty to many of those responsible for crimes\ncommitted during the military regime's\n rule.[30]\n\n Much of the scholarly literature on the TRC in South Africa\ncenters on the question of justification, on the attempt to locate a\nrationale which might make sense of an arrangement that goes against a\ngreat deal of our untrained intuitions about justice. \u201cIf\njustice requires the prosecution and punishment of those who commit\ngross human rights violations\u201d, writes Elizabeth Kiss (2000:\n68), \u201cthen the amnesty offered by the TRC violates justice. Can\nthe TRC be defended against, or in spite of, this criticism?\u201d\nSimilarly, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson (2000: 22) point out\nthat:\n In a democratic society, and especially in a society\nthat is trying to overcome injustices of the past, trading criminal\njustice for a general social benefit such as social reconciliation\nrequires a moral defense if it is to be defensible. \n\nKent Greenwalt (2000: 191) echoes the same concern when he reminds us\nthat,\n those who decide whether to include amnesty as an\nadjunct to a truth commission must face two basic issues. Does\ngranting amnesty to murderers and torturers involve doing injustice?\nWhat might justify the state's doing such an\ninjustice?\n\n\nIn what follows, we offer a critical survey of some of the most\nimportant philosophical justifications of the TRC. The discussion\napplies to any truth commission with comparable powers (this\ndiscussion is based on Eisikovits 2004, 2006).\n",
