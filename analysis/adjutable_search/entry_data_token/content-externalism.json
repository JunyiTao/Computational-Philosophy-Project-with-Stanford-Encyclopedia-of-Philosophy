Introduction\n\nIn the philosophy of mind, externalism is the view that what\nis going on inside an individual\u2019s body does not always, on its\nown, fix what is going on inside that individual\u2019s mind. The\nmind, in this sense, simply denotes the totality of mental\noccurrences undergone by an individual at any given time. The\nbody, in this sense, delineates the biological boundaries of\nthe individual which, in creatures such as us, coincide with the\nindividual\u2019s skin and, of course, includes the brain,\ntraditionally taken as the crucial determinant of an\nindividual\u2019s mental life. Thus, externalism is the view that an\nindividual\u2019s bodily (including neural) events, states,\nprocesses, etc. do not always, on their own, determine the mental,\nstates, processes had or undergone by that individual. The qualifier\nnot always permits there to be cases\u2014perhaps\nmany\u2014in which mental occurrences are fixed by bodily\noccurrences. Externalism, generically at least, is merely committed to\nthe claim that this does not always happen. The qualifier\non its own is intended to convey that even if an\nindividual\u2019s bodily occurrences do not completely\ndetermine which mental occurrences are had or undergone by that\nindividual, the former will at least partially determine the\nlatter and, indeed, can play an important role in such determination.\n\n\nExternalism appears in two major forms. Content externalism\nis externalism about mental content\u2014the content of\nmental states. It claims that the contents of at least some mental\nstates are not solely determined by occurrences falling within the\nbiological boundaries of that individual that has them. Since mental\nstates that have content are typically individuated by that content,\nthis entails that which mental states an individual has is not\ncompletely determined by occurrences falling within the biological\nboundaries of that individual. Vehicle externalism, more commonly known as the thesis of the extended mind, is externalism about the vehicles of mental content. According to the thesis of extended mind, the vehicles of mental content\u2014roughly, the physical or computational bearers of this content\u2014are not always determined or exhausted by things occurring inside the\nbiological boundaries of the individual. Content externalism and extended mind are logically independent views, and it is not uncommon to find adherents of one view denying the other. These two forms of externalism diverge sharply not simply because they are externalism about different things\u2014contents and vehicles,\nrespectively\u2014but also because they have different\nconceptions of this failure of determination. If mental contents are not determined solely by what is occurring inside the biological boundaries of an individual, this is quite different from the way in which the vehicles of content are not determined solely by what is occurring inside these boundaries. In other words, each form of\nexternalism differs not only in what it claims to be external, but\nalso in what it means by \u201cexternal\u201d.\n2. Historical Antecedents\n\nExternalism\u2014whether of content or vehicle\u2014is often viewed\nas a peculiar eruption of late twentieth-century analytic philosophy.\nThis, however, is historically myopic. Cognate views with fairly clear\nexternalist credentials have been advanced and defended much earlier\nthan this, and in some of the defining works of twentieth-century\nphilosophy (see Rowlands 2003: Chapters 3&4). Wittgenstein (1953)\nargued that meaning something by a sign does not consist in an inner\nstate or process. Rather, the possibility of such meaning depends\nessentially on the existence of a custom or practice\nof using a sign in given way, and the mastery of a\ntechnique\u2014i.e., the ability to adjust one\u2019s use of\nthe sign to bring in into accordance with this custom. According to\nthe dominant\u2014community\u2014interpretation of the\nnotion of a custom, this entails that the possibility of meaning\nsomething by a sign is dependent on the existence of a practice\nexternal to the individual meaner, and that what this individual means\nby a sign on any given occasion depends, at least in part, on this\nexternal practice. As we shall see, this social version of content\nexternalism was later developed, powerfully, by Burge (1979,\n1986).\n\nThere are earlier views that are, at least, closely aligned with\nexternalism. Sartre (1943 [1957]) argued that consciousness\u2014his\nterm for intentional mental acts in general\u2014is nothing\nin the sense that it exists only as a pure directedness towards the\nworld, and is essentially dependent for its existence on the objects\nto which it is directed. As a consequence, Sartre claimed,\nconsciousness has \u201cno content\u201d. What he meant by this that\nwhat we, today, would call the contents of intentional acts are\nalways, necessarily, outside those acts\u2014transcendent items in\nthe world rather than immanent things inside consciousness. Content\nexternalism seems to be a trivial implication of this. If it were\npossible to transplant a consciousness from one world to\nanother\u2014a staple, as we shall see, of later externalist\nliterature, but which may or may not make sense on Sartre\u2019s\nview\u2014the contents of this consciousness would necessarily\nchange. The reason this may not qualify as externalism in the standard\nsense, however, is that Sartre also defended a revisionist conception\nof the body. The body-as-lived, Sartre argued, is not\nidentical with the body-as-object\u2014the way the body is\nconceived of in the formulation of externalism. Rather, the\nbody-as-lived is revealing activity whose boundaries in no way\ncoincide with those of the body-as-object. Thus, rather than being a\nstraightforward form of externalism, Sartre\u2019s view may better be\nregarded as an abandoning the categories in terms of which the ideas\nof externalism\u2014and its oppositional counterpart,\ninternalism\u2014are formulated. The same is true of Heidegger (1927\n[1962]), to whom Sartre\u2019s discussion of the body was heavily\nindebted. Heidegger urges us to think of human\nreality\u2014dasein, the characteristic type of being\npossessed by humans\u2014not as a biological organism but, rather, as\na network of natural and social practices. Humans minds, to the extent\nthey have any place in this scheme, would certainly not reside in\nhuman bodies. However\u2014and this is why it does not qualify as\nexternalism in the usual sense\u2014neither do bodies. (But see\nWheeler 2005, for a defense of extended mind grounded in\nHeidegger\u2019s work.)\n\nWhether or not they can ultimately be characterized as externalist,\nthe views of Wittgenstein, Sartre and Heidegger play an important role\nin contextualizing the later development of externalism. Like\nexternalism, they all occupy a position that can be labeled\nanti-Cartesian. They are all opposed to the idea that the\nmental processes had by an individual are always, and completely,\ndetermined by what is going on inside that individual\u2019s body (or\nthey expand the idea of the body in non-Cartesian ways, as in the case\nof Sartre and Heidegger). This type of view is not peculiar to\nphilosophy. In psychology, expressions of the idea can be found in the\nwork of the Soviet psychologists, most notably Vygotsky (1934 [1962]), and Luria and Vygotsky (1930 [1992]) and later in James Gibson\u2019s (1966, 1979) development of an ecological psychology (see also Donald 1991 for a more recent development in this tradition). The roots of this anti-Cartesianism are not only\nbroad but deep, predating Heidegger, and indeed the twentieth century.\nGallagher (2018) argues that versions of this can be found in American\npragmatism. It may be that the ultimate roots of this sort of anti-Cartesianism lie in Hegel (Crisafi & Gallagher 2010; Boldyrev\n& Herrmann-Pillath 2013). Whether or not this is correct,\nexternalism\u2014in either form\u2014is best regarded as less an unprecedented eruption, and more as a recent expression of this\nhistorical tradition of anti-Cartesian thought.\n3. Content Externalism\n\nMany mental states or acts (some think all mental states or\nacts) are intentional in that they are about something or other. You\ndo not simply think; you think something. You do not merely\nbelieve or desire; you believe or desire something. This something\nthat you think, believe, desire or, for that matter, hope, fear,\nexpect, anticipate, and so on, is the content of the\nthinking, believing, desiring, hoping, fearing, expecting and\nanticipating. Content externalism\u2014sometimes known as\nsemantic externalism, since content is sometimes known as\nsemantic content\u2014is externalism about the content of mental\nstates or acts.\n\nContent externalism is typically understood as a claim of\ndependent possession which is, in turn, grounded in a more\nbasic claim of individuation dependence. The idea of\ndependent possession is straightforward: whether or not an individual\ncan entertain the content that p (for example, by having a\nbelief, thought, desire or other propositional attitude with this\ncontent) depends on the nature of that individual\u2019s environment\n(and facts about its relation to that environment). It is not possible\nfor an individual to entertain this content unless the environment\ncontains the requisite objects, properties, facts, events etc. of a\ncertain sort (McGinn 1989). Content externalism is the claim that, at\nleast in some cases, though not necessarily all, the possession of a\nmental state with a given content is environmentally dependent in this\nsense.\n\nThis claim of dependent possession is derivative upon a further claim:\nindividuation dependence. The general idea of individuation\ndependence is that the identity of an entity, as an entity of a\nparticular kind s, depends upon things (objects, properties,\nfacts, etc.) distinct from it. A planet is individuation dependent on\na star around which it orbits in the sense that without this star, and\nresulting orbit, it would not be a planet but some other kind of\ncelestial object. The identity of a particular celestial body\nas a planet is dependent on the star and orbit, items\ndistinct from the planet itself. The planet is, in this sense,\nindividuation dependent on the star (Macdonald 1990). A particular\nskin disturbance correctly classified as sunburn is individuation\ndependent on solar radiation in the sense that it can be sunburn only\nif it produced by solar radiation (Davidson 1987). Thus, the\nidentity of a skin disturbance as an instance of sunburn\ndepends on its standing in an appropriate relation to ultraviolet\nradiation, and it cannot be an instance of sunburn unless it stands in\nthis relation. Sunburn is, in this sense, individuation dependent on\nsolar radiation\n\nContent externalism is the thesis that at least some mental content\nis, similarly, individuation dependent on the nature of the\nenvironment, understood as a collection of circumstances that reside\noutside the biological boundaries of the individual. The identity of\ngiven content p is dependent on circumstances that lie outside\nthe biological boundaries of the (objects, properties, facts, events,\netc.) of the individual who entertains this content.\n3.1 Arguments for Content Externalism\n\nContent externalism is most commonly associated with two vivid thought\nexperiments, presented in the 1970s; the first by Hilary Putnam\n(1975), and the second by Tyler Burge (1979).\nPutnam\u2019s Twin Earth Thought Experiment\n\nImagine a planet, a twin earth. There are a few things you\nshould know about this planet. First, it duplicates earth in almost\nevery respect. On twin earth, at this very moment, a twin version of\nyou is reading a twin version of this Stanford Encyclopedia\nentry, which has been written by a twin version of me. The twin\nversion of you is your exact, molecule-for-molecule, duplicate.\nSecond, the only difference between earth and twin earth is this: on\ntwin earth, the substance that sits in oceans, flows in rivers, and\ncomes out of faucets is not water. It is not water, because it is not\nmade up of two parts of hydrogen to one part of oxygen. In fact, it is\nnot made of hydrogen and oxygen at all but, rather, some other\nelements entirely absent on our earth. Nevertheless, third, this\nsubstance looks, tastes, and feels exactly like water does to people\non our earth, and is used in the same way. Finally, this thought\nexperiment is set in 1750 (and, a corresponding twin 1750), before\npeople had any idea of the underlying molecular structure of\nsubstances such as water.\n\nSuppose you say, or write, the sentence, \u201cWater is wet\u201d.\nYour twin produces a sentence with the same phonetic or syntactic\nform: \u201cWater is wet\u201d. Do the two sentence-tokens have the\nsame meaning? Putnam\u2019s answer is that they do not. This answer\nwill be found inviting by anyone who thinks of meaning as a matter of\nreference, or truth-makers, or\ntruth-conditions, or, in short, anyone who thinks that the\nmeaning of a term or sentence is, at least in part, a matter of its\nrelation to some kind of worldly correlate. The reference of\nthe syntactic/phonetic form \u201cwater\u201d differs between you\nand your twin. When you utter the sentence, you are making a report\nabout water\u2014a substance composed of hydrogen and oxygen. But\nyour twin\u2019s corresponding report is about the substance on twin\nearth. For purposes of identification, we can call this substance\ntwater, but the twin earthlings, of course, call it no such\nthing. They speak twin-English, and so refer to this substance with\nthe syntactic/phonetic form \u201cwater\u201d. Moreover, your\nutterance and your twin\u2019s utterance are both true, but different\nfacts make them true. Your utterance is made true by a fact\nabout water, whereas your twin\u2019s utterance is made true by a\nfact about twater. The truth-conditions of the utterances\nalso differ. For your utterance to be true, water must be wet. For\nyour twin\u2019s utterances to be true, twater must be wet. Thus,\nfrom the perspective of theories that think of meaning in terms of\nthese kinds of worldly correlates\u2014reference, truth-makers,\ntruth-conditions\u2014there are good reasons for endorsing\nPutnam\u2019s conclusion.\n\nAs McGinn (1977), and Burge (1979), have pointed out, this claim can\nbe extended to the content of propositional attitudes. In ascribing a\npropositional attitude\u2014such as a thought, belief,\ndesire\u2014to a person, we use a \u201cthat\u201d-construction,\nfollowed by an embedded sentence. The sentence is commonly thought to\nexpress the content of the propositional attitude: that is, the\nmeaning of the sentence is identical with the content of the\npropositional attitude. Therefore, if the sentences expressed by you\nand your twin have different meanings, it is difficult to avoid the\nconclusion that the contents of your thoughts, beliefs and desires\nalso vary. However, beliefs, and other propositional attitudes are\nindividuated by their contents. The belief that grass is green is a\ndifferent belief from the belief that snow is white because their\ncontents are different. Therefore, if the contents of the beliefs had\nby you and your twin are different, then so too are your beliefs.\n\nDespite its seemingly outlandish nature, this twin earth thought\nexperiment is just a way of making graphic a simple point. You and\nyour twin are, as a matter of stipulation, molecule-for-molecule\nduplicates. Thus, everything situated inside your head (and biological\nboundaries more generally) is, by stipulation, qualitatively (if not\nnumerically) identical. Nevertheless, your beliefs (and other\npropositional attitudes) differ. The principle that emerges is, then,\nthis: if you fix what is going inside the head (and biological\nboundaries more generally) of an individual and vary his or her\nenvironment, some of that individual\u2019s mental states will vary\nwith variations in the environment even though everything in his or\nher head remains the same. Therefore, what occurs inside the head is,\nin this sense, not sufficient to determine or fix everything that\noccurs in the mind.\n\nDespite some initially over-exuberant formulations of Putnam\n(1975)\u2014of the \u201cCut the pie any way you like, meaning just\nain\u2019t in the head\u201d, variety\u2014the correct conclusion\nof this thought experiment does not concern the location of\n(some) mental states but, rather, a claim about their\nindividuation. External individuation does not entail\nexternal location. Sunburn, as Davidson (1987) pointed out, is\nexternally individuated: individuation dependent on factors that lie\noutside the skin. Nevertheless, it is still located on the skin. That\nsome mental states are individuation dependent on circumstances that\nexist outside the skin of an individual does not entail that those\nmental states are located outside the individual\u2019s skin.\nBurge\u2019s \u201cArthritis\u201d Thought Experiment\n\nImagine a person, let us call him Larry, who has a number of beliefs\nabout arthritis. He believes that he has arthritis, that he has had it\nfor years, that arthritis can be very painful, and that it\u2019s\nbetter to have arthritis than pancreatic cancer, and so on. He also\nbelieves he has arthritis in his thigh. This belief, according to\nBurge, is (a) an arthritis-belief and (b) false. It is false because\narthritis is an affliction of the joints only. But why is it an\narthritis-belief\u2014a belief about arthritis? Burge\u2019s answer\nis that Larry inhabits a linguistic community made up of people who\nuse the term \u201carthritis\u201d in a certain way, and Larry would\nallow himself to be corrected by expert members of that community.\nThus, when a doctor tells him, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not arthritis\nyou have. Arthritis is an affliction of the joints\u201d. Larry would\nbe inclined to accept this, and revise his belief accordingly.\n\nNow we imagine Larry in a counterfactual situation. Counterfactual\nLarry is type-identical with Larry in point of functional profile,\nbehavioral dispositions, and experiential history (all\nindividualistically specified\u2014that is, specified in such a way\nthat does not presume the existence of anything outside Larry). The\ncounterfactuality of the situation pertains only to Larry\u2019s\nlinguistic community. In this counterfactual situation, the phonetic\nor syntactic form \u201carthritis\u201d\u2014as used by physicians,\nlexicographers, and competent laypersons\u2014applies not only to an\naffliction of the joints but also to various other rheumatoid\nailments. That is, in the counterfactual situation, the correct use of\nthe term \u201carthritis\u201d encompasses Larry\u2019s actual\nmisuse. In this counterfactual situation, Burge argues, Larry\npossesses a true belief about what is going on in his thigh but,\ncrucially, it is not an arthritis-belief. Rather, he has\nbeliefs about a distinct condition\u2014tharthritis, an\namalgam of arthritis and rheumatism, as we might regard it.\n\nIf this is correct, Larry\u2019s beliefs vary between actual and\ncounterfactual situations. Larry, however, is identical in both\nsituations. The only difference lies in the differing natures of his\nlinguistic communities\u2014specifically, the differing uses of the\nword-form, \u201carthritis\u201d. As in Putnam\u2019s\nthought-experiment, the difference in meaning again stems from a\ndifference in extension of a term, resulting in different\ntruth-conditions, truth-makers, and the like. But in Putnam\u2019s\ncase, the differences stem from differences in the natural\nenvironment. In Burge\u2019s thought experiment, these differences\nstem from differences in linguistic practice. As in the Putnam case,\nthe argument can easily be extended to the contents of propositional\nattitudes, and Burge, unlike Putnam, explicitly endorses this\nextension.\n3.2 Responses to Content Externalism\n\nResponses to content externalism divide into several kinds. The first\ntype of response simply regards externalism as insufficiently\nsupported by the kinds of arguments developed by Putnam and Burge,\neither because their conclusions are non sequiturs or because the\narguments are deficient in some other way. In this vein, Boghossian\n(1997), for example, devises the case of \u201cDry Earth\u201d, a\nplanet whose inhabitants (who are our intrinsic duplicates) are under\nthe illusion that there is a clear, colorless liquid flowing\nout of the faucets and filling the lakes and oceans. According to\nBoghossian, externalists are committed to implausible claims\nconcerning the content of Dry Earthlings\u2019 thoughts about this\nillusory liquid. (Segal [2000] endorses a variation on this argument\nfrom Dry Earth; see Korman [2006] and Pryor [2007] for externalist\nreplies.). Crane (1991) argues that in Burge\u2019s example, there is\nno reason for thinking that Jane has different concepts in the two\nsituations, as her dispositions remain exactly the same. Crane thinks\nthat in both situations, Jane lacks the concept of arthritis, but\npossesses the concept of tharthritis. Burge was, therefore, mistaken\nin attributing to Jane in the actual world the belief that she has\narthritis in her thigh. Georgalis (1999) takes a similar view, as does\nWikforss (2001).\n\nA second type of response objects to these externalist arguments on\nbroadly methodological grounds that concern the use of thought\nexperiments, and intuitions more generally, in determining whether\ncontent is wide or narrow. Cummins (1991) argues that empirical\nresearch is needed to find out about the nature of belief, not thought\nexperiments. Chomsky (1995) holds a similar view. The reliance of\nPutnam\u2019s and Burge\u2019s arguments on intuitions is anathema\nto many in the experimental philosophy movement who regard them as\nculturally-relative and shifting and, therefore, not philosophically\nsignificant (see, for example, Mallon et al. 2009).\n\nA third type of response questions the legitimacy of the\ninternalism-externalism debate. Gertler (2012), for example, has\nargued that there is no understanding of the distinction between\ninternal and external properties, and related distinctions such as\nthat between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, that will correctly\ncategorize the views we take to be clearly externalist or internalist.\nIf Gertler is correct, perhaps the most common way of understanding\ninternalism, as the doctrine that content supervenes on the intrinsic\nproperties of an individual, is unworkable. She therefore maintains\nthat there is no genuine dispute at issue in the\ninternalism-externalism debate, and recommends that philosophers drop\nthe issue in favor of more well-defined questions. There is, more\ngenerally, an interesting question concerning how to understand the\ncrucial distinction between a creature\u2019s external properties and\nthose that are intrinsic or internal. Many contributors to the debate\nover externalism take internal properties to be physical\nproperties of a creature that do not depend for their instantiation on\nany property instantiated outside the boundary of the creature\u2019s\nbody and brain. A difficulty with this understanding of the\ndistinction, pointed out by Farkas (2003), is that it appears to rule\nout the possibility of antiphysicalist internalists. This is ironic,\ngiven that Descartes is often held up as a paradigmatic example of an\ninternalist about mental content. Williamson (2000) suggests that\ninternalism can be understood as the doctrine that mental content\nsupervenes on environmentally-independent phenomenal states, and\nFarkas (2003, 2008) makes a similar proposal.\n3.3 Narrow Content\n\nA fourth response to the arguments for content externalism involves\naccepting the force of those arguments but limiting their\nsignificance. According to this type of response, externalism is true\nof only one type of content, or of content understood in one\nparticular way. The kind of content susceptible to Putnam/Burge-style\nconsiderations is wide or broad content. But there\nis, some have argued, another type of content\u2014narrow\ncontent\u2014that is immune to these kinds of arguments. In the years\nimmediately following the publication of Putnam (1975), it was common\nto think of narrow content as phenomenal content (see, e.g.,\nFodor 1981, 1982; McGinn 1982). The motivation for this is the idea\nthat even if the contents of you and your twin\u2019s beliefs vary,\nthere is still something that you and your twin have in common. You\nboth believe, for example, that the colorless, odorless, transparent,\npotable etc. liquid in front of you is wet. This strategy faces at\nleast two problems. First, it conflicts with Burge\u2019s claim that\nhis type of counterfactual earth argument applies to all concepts\nknown by observational means, a category which includes properties\nsuch as being colorless, being odorless, etc. Second, even if the\nfirst objection can be avoided, it is not clear that we can purge\nthese phenomenal specifications of content of all concepts immune to\ntwin earth style considerations (for example, the concept of liquid as\nemployed in the above specification) whilst retaining sufficient\nresources to adequately specify the content of the belief.\n\nFodor (1987) adopts a different strategy. He agrees that physically\nidentical individuals have different wide contents when embedded in\ndifferent contexts. However, Fodor suggests that their beliefs still\nhave the same narrow contents, which are functions from contexts to\nwide contents. You and your twin share this: a something (it is\nimpossible to specify what this is) which when plugged in to the\nearthly context yields the (broad) content that water is wet, but when\nplugged into the twin-earthly context yields the (broad) content that\ntwater is wet (a content expressed by the twin-earthly \u201cWater is\nwet\u201d, of course). This strategy has been objected to by\nStalnaker (1989) and Block (1991) on the grounds that narrow content,\nas conceived by Fodor, is not, in fact, content at all. If narrow\ncontents, as Fodor argues, map contexts of thinking onto\ntruth-conditions, they do not themselves have truth-conditions and\ntherefore fail to qualify as contents in any recognizable sense.\nAccording to Stalnaker (1989), narrow content is, therefore, nothing\nmore than syntax (understood as functional or computational\nrole).\n\nThere are two more recent developments in semantic theory that can\nbeen used to identify and defend a concept of narrow content. One of\nthese is two-dimensional semantics and its application to the\ncontents of propositional attitudes (Lewis 1981, Jackson 2007, and\nChalmers 2012). Chalmers, for example, argues that a generalized 2D\nsemantic framework can be used to isolate an a priori aspect of\nmeaning that will be shared by you and your twin. You and your twin,\non this view, always have a priori access to the truth-conditions of\nyour own thoughts or sentences. If correct, this entails that there is\na type or component of content that is not vulnerable to twin earth\nmanipulation and so might qualify as narrow.\n\nThe second development derives from the phenomenal intentionality\ntheory. Advocates of the idea of phenomenal intentionality seek\nto ground the intentionality of mental states in phenomenal\nconsciousness, the subjective, experiential features of those states.\nAccording to this view, phenomenal intentionality is basic, with any\nother forms of intentionality derivative upon this basic form (Horgan\n& Tienson 2002, Loar 2003, Kriegel 2013). According to many\narticulations of the phenomenal intentionality theory (e.g., Siewert\n1998; Kriegel 2007, 2011; and Farkas 2008), the content of your\nthought and that of your twin is the same and that content is narrow.\nThese attempts to construct a viable notion of narrow content have\nbeen systematically criticized by Yli-Vakkuri and Hawthorne (2018). If\nthey are correct, there is no form of content that can be easily\ncordoned off from the world, and a thoroughgoing form of content\nexternalism must, therefore, be true. (See entry on\n narrow mental content\n for more detailed discussion).\n4. The Significance of Content Externalism\n\nThe significance of content externalism is potentially far-reaching\nthough often unclear and disputed.\n\nIdealism. Content externalism is sometimes portrayed as a\nthesis whose truth precludes idealism in at least some of its major\nforms (see Rowlands 2003, for example). However, it is not clear that\nthis is really the case. For example, even a Berkeleian idealist could\naccept Putnam\u2019s twin earth arguments if thus inclined. All that\nis required for Putnam\u2019s argument to work is a distinction\nbetween the way water and twater appear and their underlying\nstructures. This is something the Berkeleian idealist can, it seems,\naccommodate. For example, the Berkeleian idealist can explain the\ndifferences in underlying structure between water and twater in terms\nof the difference in the ideas that God would flash into your mind and\nthat of your twin post 1750, when you both get down to the business of\ninvestigating (what you think of as) the underlying structure of the\nsubstance in your oceans and rivers. Content externalism requires a\nreality that exists independently of the thinking subject or subjects\nthat feature in the thought experiment. But it does not appear to\nrequire that this reality be non-mental. Some forms of content\nexternalism require this, supposition for example Sartre (1943\n[1957]). But not all forms appear to do so. The relation between\ncontent externalism and idealism, in its various forms, is, therefore,\nnot a straightforward one.\n\nContent Externalism and Self-Knowledge. Externalism is\nimportantly connected with issues surrounding our introspective\nknowledge of our own mental states. Such knowledge appears to be a\npriori, or at least privileged, in that it is acquired without\nrelying on empirical evidence or observations. On the face of it,\nexternalism threatens the existence of such privileged knowledge. If\nthe contents of our thoughts are determined in part by our relations\nto the environment, then one might think that external observations\nare needed in order to know what we think. But self-knowledge does not\ncome about through empirical investigations. So either, contrary to\nappearance, we do not really know the contents of our own thoughts or,\nif we do, externalism is false. (See the entry on\n externalism and self-knowledge\n for further discussion).\n\nExternalism and Mind-Body Theories. Externalism has important\nconsequences for a number of different mind-body theories. Burge\n(1979) believes that externalism refutes individualistic theories of\nintentional mental states. These are theories that define or explain\nwhat it is for a person to have an intentional mental state purely in\nterms of intrinsic facts about that person without reference to the\nenvironment. Examples of such theories include the identity theory,\nand\n functionalism (see entry)\n in its traditional guise. McGinn (1989) and Burge (1986, 1993) both\nargue that externalism refutes the token-identity theory (and hence\nthe type-identity theory as well). This is contested by Davidson\n(1987), Macdonald (1990) Gibbons (1993), and Frances (2007). With\nregard to functionalism, one way to deal with externalism is to adopt\na divide-and-conquer strategy. One might restrict functionalism to\nproviding an account of what it is to be a particular kind of mental\nstate (e.g., a belief) individualistically, while adopting an\nexternalist theory of content (Fodor 1987). Alternatively, one might\nadopt a \u201clong arm\u201d functionalism that specifies functional\nroles in such a way that they incorporate worldly items and properties\n(Block 1990). On such a view, the functional role of your belief that\nwater is wet would be different from the functional role of your\ntwin\u2019s belief that twater is wet, on the grounds that the\nfunctional role of your belief involves you perceiving and doing\nthings with water whereas that of your twin involves her perceiving\nand doing things with twater.\n\nThough externalism may (or may not) be incompatible with these\ninternalist forms of physicalism, this should not be taken to imply\nthat externalism is itself an antiphysicalist doctrine, for one might\nhold that although mental contents do not supervene on narrow physical\nproperties, they do supervene on wide physical properties. There is no\nobvious reason for physicalism about the mind to require a\ncreature\u2019s mental properties to supervene on its narrow physical\nproperties. (For discussion of the requirements on physicalism, see\nthe entry on\n physicalism.)\n\nMental Causation. Another debate that arises out of\nexternalism concerns the legitimacy of wide contents in causal\nexplanations. Most philosophers agree with Davidson (1980) that\nbeliefs and desires play an important role in the causal explanation\nof actions. However, it is not clear how this can be reconciled with\nexternalism. The problem comes up because it has been suggested that\ncausal explanations of behavior should appeal only to the intrinsic\nproperties of our bodies, properties that describe what is happening\nhere and now within us (Stich 1983). But externalism says that mental\ncontents are determined by causal, social or historical factors,\nfactors which extend spatially and temporally beyond the body. This\nseems to imply that wide mental contents cannot be causally relevant\nbecause of their relational nature.\n\nThere are two main strategies to show that wide mental contents can\nlegitimately enter into causal explanations. The first strategy is to\nargue that the causal efficacy of a mental state with wide content\nderives from the causal efficacy of a corresponding internal state. To\nuse a non-mental example, we often say that a mosquito bite causes\nswelling, even though being a mosquito bite is a relational property.\nHowever, one worry with this approach is why it doesn\u2019t show\nthat wide contents are not causally relevant after all, because it is\nthe internal component (the skin itching, swollen skin disturbance)\nthat is doing all the causal work. A different way to defend the\nexplanatory relevance of wide content is to identify its distinctive\nexplanatory role without them being parasitic upon the causal efficacy\nof intrinsic properties. For example, according to Dretske (1988),\nwhen my intention to drink water causes me to raise my glass, the\nbehavior that is the object of the causal explanation is not a single\nevent, but a complex process where an internal state causes some\nbodily movement. Dretske argues that the wide content of my intention\nplays a causal role because it provides a structural explanation of\nhow the internal brain state comes to be recruited to cause the bodily\nmovement. Williamson (2000) offers a different account of the\nexplanatory role of wide contents. He thinks they provide us with a\nbetter understanding of the connection between the mental states of an\nagent and his actions in the non-immediate future, because our actions\ntypically involve complex interactions with the environment. (For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n mental causation).\n5. Extended Mind\n\nThe expression extended mind was coined by Clark and Chalmers (1998), but essentially the same view has gone by a variety of names,\nincluding \u201cactive externalism\u201d, \u201cextended cognition\u201d (both Clark and Chalmers 1998), \u201cvehicle externalism\u201d (Hurley 1998), \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d (Rowlands 1999),\nand \u201ccognitive integration\u201d (Menary 2007). While this variegation in nomenclature is unimportant in itself, it is important\nto (a) to distinguish extended mind from other views with which it might be confused, and (b) capture the significant internal variegation in views that might be classified as versions of extended mind. First, however, the general idea needs to be delineated (see Menary 2010 for a collection of thematic papers, both pro and con).\n\nMental content is not free-floating. Wherever there is mental content\nthere is something that has it\u2014a vehicle of content.\nMental states (belief, desires, hopes, and fears, etc.) are\nnatural candidates for vehicles of content. So too are mental\nacts (believing, desiring, hoping, fearing, etc.). As a\nrough, initial approximation, extended mind is the view\nthat not all mental states or acts are exclusively located inside the\nperson who believes, desires, hopes, fears, and so on. Rather, some\nmental states or acts are, in part, constituted by factors\n(e.g., structures, processes) that are located outside the biological\nboundaries of the individuals that have them. Thus, extended mind differs from content externalism not merely in being about mental vehicles rather than mental contents, but also in being committed to a claim of external location rather than simply external\nindividuation. If extended mind is true, some vehicles of\ncontent are not, entirely, located inside the biological boundaries of\nindividuals that have them. Rather, they are, partly, constituted by,\nor are composed of, factors that lie outside those boundaries. \n\nThe distinction between states and acts is, in the context of this\nform of externalism, a significant one, and the general idea of\nextended mind can be developed in two quite different ways\ndepending on whether we think of the vehicles of content as states or\nas acts. Thinking of the vehicles of content as states leads to a\nstate-oriented version of extended mind. Thinking of\nthese vehicles as acts leads to a process-oriented\nalternative.\n5.1 State-Oriented Extended Mind\n\nClark and Chalmers (1998) provide a canonical argument for\nstate-oriented extended mind. Otto is in the early stages of\nAlzheimer\u2019s, and to facilitate his engagement with the world he\nwrites down what he suspects will be useful information in a notebook.\nReading in a newspaper that there is a particular exhibition going on\nat the Museum of Modern Art, Otto looks in his notebook, and\nfinds the sentence, \u201cThe Museum of Modern Art is on\n53rd Street\u201d, and, desiring to see the exhibition,\nduly sets off to 53rd Street. Clark and Chalmers argue, or\nare commonly taken to argue, that the sentence should be regarded as\none of Otto\u2019s beliefs. Their argument is predicated on a\nfunctionalist conception of beliefs as individuated by their\nfunctional roles. The sentence plays a functional role in Otto\u2019s\npsychological economy that is, if not precisely identical, similar\nenough to the functional role of a belief in the psychology of an\nunimpaired subject for the sentence to qualify as a belief. If this is\ncorrect, it means that at least one of Otto\u2019s beliefs lies in\nthe notebook rather than in his head. As usually understood, this view\nqualifies as a form of state-oriented extended mind to the\nextent that it identifies a mental state (a belief) with an external\nstructure (a sentence).\n5.2 Objections to State-Oriented Extended Mind\n\nThe identification of a belief with a sentence has proved\ncontroversial. One objection takes the form of an alleged reductio\nad absurdum: the identification of a belief with a sentence leads\nto cognitive bloat (see Ludwig 2015). If the sentences in\nOtto\u2019s notebook can qualify as his beliefs, why not the\nsentences in an encyclopedia or the sentences found on the\ninternet\u2014both of which Otto might also access with relative\nease? Clark and Chalmers responded to this worry via two stipulations:\n(1) the subject must, at some time, have consciously endorsed this\ninformation, and (2) the subject must have entered the information in\nthe book him- or herself. It is unclear whether these will work.\nSubliminal beliefs provide a problem for the first stipulation, for\nthese are beliefs that have not been consciously endorsed by their\npossessors. If such beliefs exist, then conscious endorsement of a\nbelief does not seem to be a necessary condition of its possession.\nWith regard to the second stipulation, it is not clear if this is\ncompatible with Clark and Chalmers\u2019s underlying functionalism.\nAccording to functionalism, roughly, if something functions as belief\nthen it is a belief. From a functionalist perspective, how a belief\ncame to be acquired\u2014entered into a person\u2019s collection of\nbeliefs\u2014is not directly relevant. It would be relevant only if\nit could be shown that having personally entered the belief into\none\u2019s collection of beliefs it essential to it having the\nfunctional role of a belief. It is not clear what such an argument\nwould look like.\n\nAnother objection to state-oriented extended mind is that it\nconfuses the claim that vehicles of cognition are extended with the\n(weaker) claim that they are embedded or scaffolded\nor, equivalently, that it falls victim to a\ncoupling-constitution confusion (Adams & Aizawa 2001,\n2008; Rupert 2004). On the state-oriented interpretation, a vehicle of\ncontent is extended if it is identical with, or constituted\nby, a structure that lies outside the biological boundaries of an\nindividual. But a vehicle of cognition is (merely) embedded\nif it depends on, or is coupled with (causally or otherwise)\nstructures that lie outside the biological boundaries of the\nindividual without being identical with those structures. According to\nthis second objection, arguments for extended mind only\nestablish that vehicles of content are embedded, or coupled, with the\nenvironment rather than being extended or constituted, by the\nenvironment.\n\nA third type of objection to state-oriented extended mind is the\noriginal intentionality objection, versions of which have\nbeen leveled by Adams and Aizawa (2001, 2008), Fodor (2009), and\nRowlands (2010). In a tradition instigated by Brentano, original\nintentionality is often taken to be the hallmark of the mental.\nOriginal intentionality is defined as intentionality that is not\nderived. And derived intentionality is intentionality that derives\nfrom the mental activity, often mediated by social conventions, of a\nsubject. The intentionality of the sentence, \u201cThe Museum of\nModern Art is on 53rd Street\u201d, is clearly derived\nintentionality. In itself, this sentence is merely a pattern of shapes\nagainst a contrastive background and, in principle, could mean\nanything. To mean something, it must be interpreted, and its\nintentionality is, therefore, derived. Beliefs are mental entities. If\noriginal intentionality is the hallmark of the mental, then the\nsentence in Otto\u2019s notebook is not mental. Therefore, the\nobjection runs, it is difficult to see how it could be a belief.\n5.3 Process-Oriented Extended Mind\n\nState-oriented extended mind identifies a mental state (e.g., a\nbelief) with an external structure (e.g., a sentence). However, mental\nstates are not the only candidates for the vehicles of content. Mental\nacts\u2014thinking, believing (or judging), remembering,\netc.\u2014have at least as much claim to be regarded as such\nvehicles. And switching the focus from states to acts affords the\npossibility of a more process-oriented interpretation of extended mind. We might regard Otto\u2019s notebook as an item of scaffolding in roughly the sense championed by Vygotsky (1934 [1962]). In these terms, the state-oriented version of extended mind identifies a mental state with a piece of this scaffolding\u2014if this piece plays the requisite functional role. In the process-oriented version of extended mind, focus switches from the scaffolding to the process of manipulating the scaffolding. This manipulating of the scaffolding can, on the process-oriented version of extended mind, form part of a cognitive process.\n\nThe process-oriented version of extended mind would interpret\nthe case of Otto rather differently. There is no identification of a\nmental state with an external structure\u2014a belief with a\nsentence. Rather, there is, first of all, a mental process. Describing\nthis as a process of believing is, perhaps, a little forced: a process\nof remembering seems more apt. When Otto engages with, or\nmanipulates, his notebook\u2014flipping through the pages,\nand scanning each page\u2014this manipulation forms part of his\nprocess of remembering the location of the Museum of Modern Art. This\nis only part of the process, of course: little remembering would get\ndone without a suitable contribution from the brain. Nevertheless,\nOtto\u2019s manipulation of the book is part of that process.\n\nTwo distinct types of motivation can be identified for this claim. The\nfirst is a broadly functionalist one, akin to the functionalist\nmotivation for state-oriented extended mind. The idea is that\nthe computational profile of the process of manipulating the book is\nbroadly similar to that of internal processes responsible for\ncognition (Wilson 1994, 2004; Clark 1989, 1997, 2008a, 2008b; Rowlands 1999, 2010, Wheeler\n2010). Standard accounts of cognition postulate information-bearing structures (roughly, representations) and transformative processes performed on those structures, where these processes have the function of identifying information and making it available either to the cognitive subject or to further processing operations. Thus, for example, David Marr\u2019s canonical account of vision postulates a series of information-bearing structures\u2014retinal image, raw primal sketch, full primal sketch, and so on, combined with operations that successively transform one structure into the next. The overall function of these processes is to identify and make available to the subject information that can be used to solve the task of seeing an object. Similarly, when Otto manipulates his notebook this, in general terms, is also what he seems to be doing: acting on information-bearing structures with a view to making available information that he needs to solve the cognitive task of remembering the location of The Museum of Modern Art. From this suitably abstract computational perspective, it is argued, there does not seem to be a huge amount of difference between internal processes performed by the brain on information-bearing structures and external processes performed by the organism on information-bearing structures. They have\nthe same abstract computational profile and purpose.\n\nAnother type of argument draws its inspiration from the\nphenomenological tradition. Wheeler (2005), for example, draws on the\nwork of Heidegger (1927 [1962]) in defending a version of extended mind. Rowlands (2010), developing certain themes implicit in\nHusserl and Sartre, defends a model of intentionality as revealing\nactivity: the presenting (revealing or disclosing) of an object\nas falling under a given mode of presentation. While the activity\nthrough which this presentation occurs can be purely\ninternal\u2014i.e., neural or neurocomputational activity\u2014it\nneed not be, and typically is not. Often this internal activity is\ncombined with actions performed by an organism on the world around it.\nOn this view, when Otto manipulates his book, he is engaging in\nrevealing activity: The Museum of Modern Art is revealed, disclosed or\npresented as being located on East 53rd Street. This\nrevealing activity comprises both activity occurring in Otto\u2019s\nbrain and wider activity performed by Otto on the world. As revealing\nactivity, therefore, the process of remembering occurs partly inside\nOtto and partly outside him.\n\nWhether computationally or phenomenologically inspired,\nprocess-oriented extended mind may fare better with\nthe objections that were leveled at its state-oriented counterpart.\nThe bloat objection seems to have less purchase on process-oriented\nextended mind. For example, Otto\u2019s act of remembering\nextends no further than the things he does to and with his notebook.\nThere is no reason for thinking that it extends into things such an\nencyclopedia or the internet that Otto is not currently manipulating\nor exploiting.\n\nThe original intentionality objection is also, at least partly,\ndeflected. In this amalgamated process, that combines things going on\nboth inside and outside Otto\u2019s skin, there is original\nintentionality aplenty. Otto has to read what he scans on each page,\nand his seeing will have original intentionality. He will have to\nunderstand what he sees, and this understanding will also have\noriginal intentionality. Therefore, the overall process is not at all\ndevoid of original intentionality (Menary 2006, 2007). It can,\nhowever, can be objected that this original intentionality is confined\nto segments of the process that are located exclusively inside\nOtto\u2019s skin (Adams 2010). A response to this objection might\ntake two forms. One is to accept the claim, and argue that it does not\nmatter. In this vein, one might point to that the fact that it would\nbe extremely implausible to require that every internal part of a\ncognitive process, understood neuro-physiologically or\ncomputationally, must possess original intentionality. A retinal\nimage, for example, might possess original intentionality of a sort.\nThe visual representation into which this image is progressively\ntransformed by constructive operations on the part of the brain would,\nprobably, possess original intentionality. But those constructive\noperations would not (Rowlands 2010). The other option is to deny the\nclaim. This would require showing that at least some things that are\nnot located in or at the skin possess original intentionality.\nRowlands (2006), for example, argues that this is true of what he\ncalls pre-intentional actions or doings. The debate\nis ongoing, and it is not clear whether there is an answer that would\nconvince both parties.\n5.4 The Mark of the Cognitive/Mental\n\nTied to this lack of definitiveness is the third charge leveled\nagainst extended mind: the coupling-constitution confusion. A\nsimple charge of confusion is difficult to sustain. Proponents of\nextended mind are, in general well aware of the distinction\nbetween causal coupling and constitution. In the case of Otto, for\nexample, Clark and Chalmers argue that a sentence should be identified\nwith a belief\u2014rather than the latter being merely coupled with\nthe former\u2014precisely because the sentence has the functional\nrole of a belief. A more plausible form of the objection might be that\nthe arguments provided by proponents of extended mind\u2014whether state- or process-oriented\u2014do not\nestablish what these proponents have taken them to\nestablish. Specifically, they do not establish anything more than the\nclaim that cognitive processes are coupled with external processes\nrather than that they are constituted by them. Answering both the\noriginal intentionality objection and the coupling-constitution\nobjection, therefore, seems to require the ability to identity when a\nprocess is, and is not, a cognitive process.\n\nRupert (2009) argues that the best way to approach this is through the\nidentification of a cognitive system, an identification that will rest\nheavily on how the sciences of the mind individuate such systems. The\nmost plausible conception of a cognitive system, he argues, counts\nagainst extended mind. Another approach argues the need for\nidentification of a mark of the cognitive\u2014a set of\nnecessary, sufficient, or necessary and sufficient, conditions for a\nprocess to count as cognitive. Reaction to this suggestion can be\ndivided into three broad camps. First, there are those who think that\na mark of the cognitive is not necessary. Just as we can study biology\nwithout a mark of the biological, and practice medicine without a\ncriterion of the medical, we can also do cognitive science without a\ncriterion of the cognitive (Allen 2017). Second, there are those who\nthink a criterion of cognition is required, can be identified, and\ncounts against extended mind (Adams 2010). Third, there are\nthose who think a criterion of the cognitive is available and it\nsupports extended mind (Rowlands 2009, 2010).\n6. The Scope of Extended Mind\n\nIn its earlier incarnations, the scope of extended mind was\nrelatively restricted, it being understood, primarily, as a thesis\nabout cognition. The types of external structure or activity involved\nin developing the idea of extended mind reflected this focus on\ncognition. They were predominantly thought of as structures that\ncarried information pertinent to the solution of cognitive tasks that\nan organism might face, where the organism, through acting on these\nstructures, could transform this information from information merely\npresent in the structures to information that is available to the\norganism (Rowlands 2010). Accordingly, expansion in the scope of\nextended mind can, and has, occurred along two (related)\ndimensions: (1) expansion in scope from cognition to other kinds of\nmental process, and (2) expansion in the types of external structure\ninvolve in these extended mental processes.\n\nSome prominent advocates of extended cognitive states or processes\nhave been skeptical of the idea that consciousness could be extended,\noften on the grounds that external structures do not possess the kind\nof informational bandwidth necessary to sustain conscious experience\n(Clark 2009, Chalmers 2019). Others are more sanguine about this\npossibility, and extended accounts of experiences (Rowlands 2010) and\nother conscious states, such as emotions (Krueger 2014; Krueger &\nSzanto 2016; Carter et al. 2016) have been defended. At the same time,\nand relatedly, there has been an expansion in the types of external\nstructures thought relevant. In particular, there has been a\npronounced social turn in extended mind in recent\nyears, exploring the ways in which social structures and institutions\nmight also, in part, be constitutive of constitute mental processes\n(De Jaegher et al. 2010, Gallagher 2013, Lyre 2018, and Slors 2019),\nand the idea that our basic biological cognitive faculties may be\ntransformed by a process of enculturation (Menary 2015) has\nhelped reshape extended mind in recent years. One important\nexample of this social turn pertains to the study of memory, in\nparticular, in the way in which memory is often\ntransactive\u2014involving the combined efforts of two or\nmore people, bonded together as a coupled system (Barnier et al \n2008; Sutton 2008, 2010, 2015).\n7. Extended Mind and the 4E Mind\n\nAnother way of delineating the scope of extended mind is by more\nprecisely identifying its location in an array of anti-Cartesian\npossibilities. Extended mind supplies one of the\n\u201cE\u201ds in what has become known as 4E cognition, or\nthe 4E mind more generally in deference to the idea that its\nscope may be broader than simply cognition (Newen, De Bruin, &\nGallagher 2018). The label \u201c4E\u201d is intended to capture the\nidea that at least some mental processes are embodied,\nembedded, enacted and/or extended, or some\ncombination thereof.\n\nThe clam that mental processes are embodied can mean at least\ntwo distinct things (Prinz 2009). On the one hand, it can signify that\nmental processes depend on possession and use of a body rather than\nmerely a brain (Haugeland 1993, Shapiro 2004). This idea can, itself,\nfragment into different views, depending on how we understand the idea\nof dependence. The claim can be understood as causal dependence:\n(some) mental processes causally depend (for their existence,\nidentity, etc.) on the body and its characteristics. On the other\nhand, it can be understood as a claim of constitution: (some)\nprocesses occurring inside the body, but outside the brain, can\npartially constitute mental processes. On the other hand, there is\nanother way of understanding the claim that mental processes are\nembodied, specifically, as the claim that (some) mental processes\ndepend on mental representations that relate to body (Prinz 2009).\nThese representations come in two forms: ones that affect the body,\nsuch as motor commands, and ones that represent or respond to the\nbody, such as a perception of a bodily movement. Thus, on this view, a\nmental process would count as embodied if it involves, for example, a\nrepresentation located in the motor cortex, even though the motor\ncortex is intracranial.\n\nSome proponents of extended mind regard their view as\nantithetical to the claim that mental processes are embodied. For\nexample, Clark (2008a) argues that there is, at the very least, a tension between the two views. His version of extended mind is grounded in a liberal version of\nfunctionalism, according to which mental states and processes are individuated by functional roles specified in a fairly abstract way, as general principles linking perception, mental states and processes, and action that does not specify, in any depth, the nature of the mechanisms responsible for this linkage. The claim of embodiment, on\nthe other hand, Clark sees as grounded either in a rejection of functionalism, or in a form of functionalism that is far more chauvinistic, in that it does, in its specification of functional roles, specify at least some of the details of their realizing mechanisms. Others see extended and embodied views of the mind as much more compatible or aligned than this, even as different facets of the same view (for example, Menary 2007, Rowlands 2010).\n\nA mental process is embedded if it functions, perhaps has\nbeen designed to function, in tandem with a surrounding, environmental\nscaffolding, such that without the presence of this scaffolding the\nprocess will fail to do what it is supposed to do, or be less likely\nto achieve what it is supposed to achieve, or do what it is supposed\nto so in a less than maximally efficient way, etc. The external\nscaffolding carries information pertinent to the cognitive task that\nthe process is designed to accomplish, and a cognizing organism can,\nby manipulating or exploiting the structure in an appropriate way,\navail itself of this information. Cognition, on this view, still\nresides in the head. But the net result is that at least some of the\ndifficulty of the cognitive task is offloaded onto the world. The\nrequired internal, intra-cranial, processing is not as sophisticated\nas it would have needed to be if there was no environmental\nscaffolding around. Think of the difference between doing long\ndivision in your head or doing it with a pen and paper (Rumelhart et\nal. 1986). The external notation is a form of scaffolding that reduces\nthe complexity of the required internal processing. Kirsh and Maglio\n(1994) label this kind of action\u2014that changes the nature of the\ncognitive task that must be performed internally\u2014epistemic\naction.\n\nThe claim that some mental processes are embedded is, prima facie, one\nthat belongs on a spectrum of anti-Cartesian ways of conceptualizing\nthe mind. A, perhaps, curious feature of the recent dialectic, however, is\nthat the idea of embedding is often used as a way of devaluing the\nclaims of extended mind. The idea, here, is that the arguments\npurported to establish that mental processes are extended really only\nshow that such processes are embedded (Adams & Aizawa 2008, Rupert\n2004). This objection is a version of the\ncoupling-constitution objection outlined in\n section 5.2.\n\nA mental process is enacted if it involves, or is constituted\nby, a dynamic, interactive coupling of processes occurring inside the\nskin or skull of an organism and processes external to said skin or\nskull. Enactivism appears in a variety of forms. However, it is\nplausible to suppose that process-oriented extended mind\ncoincides with at least some of them. In explaining the nature of\nconscious experience, for example, many forms of enactivism appeal to\nthe ability of the experiencing organism to act on the world around.\nAbilities, perhaps, need not be extended. But some versions of\nenactivism also appeal to the exercise of these abilities. A\ncommon enactivist way of explaining the sense of phenomenal\npresence\u2014the sense of being presented with a richly structured,\ndetailed world\u2014does not appeal to a representational structure\nthat replicates this detail. If representations area involved at all,\nthey give us merely the rough gist of the visual situation. The sense\nof richness and details results from the experiencing organism\navailing itself of the richness and detail in the world itself\n(O\u2019Regan & No\u00eb 2001, No\u00eb [ed.] 2002, No\u00eb\n2004). By acting on a rich and detailed world, therefore, the organism\ninjects richness and detail into its experience. The organism\u2019s\nexperience of the richness and detail of the world is realized not by\na representation but by a sequence of dynamic, coupled interactions\nwith the external scene itself.\n\nEnactivism comes in a variety of forms (Chemero 2009; Hutto & Myin\n2012, 2017; No\u00eb 2004). But an emphasis on dynamic, tightly\ncoupled interactions between organism runs through all versions of\nenactivism and finds clear echoes in at least the process-oriented\nversion of extended mind. Thus, while there are, perhaps,\ndifferences of emphasis, it is likely that some versions of enactivism\ncoincide with some versions of extended mind.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Frederick, 2010, \u201cWhy We Still Need a Mark of the\nCognitive\u201d, <em>Cognitive Systems Research</em>, 11(4):\n324\u2013331. doi:10.1016/j.cogsys.2010.03.001", "Adams, Fred and Ken Aizawa, 2001, \u201cThe Bounds of\nCognition\u201d, <em>Philosophical Psychology</em>, 14(1):\n43\u201364. doi:10.1080/09515080120033571", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2008, <em>The Bounds of Cognition</em>, New\nYork: Wiley-Blackwell.", "Allen, Colin, 2017, \u201cOn (Not) Defining Cognition\u201d,\n<em>Synthese</em>, 194(11): 4233\u20134249.\ndoi:10.1007/s11229-017-1454-4", "Barnier, Amanda J., John Sutton, Celia B.
