Challenging Choice Situations, Problematic Preference Structures, and Dynamic Choice Problems\n\nEffective choice over time can be extremely difficult given certain\nchallenging choice situations or problematic preference structures,\nsuch as the ones described below. As will become apparent, these\nchoice situations or preference structures can prompt a series of\ndecisions that serve one\u2019s large-scale, ongoing concerns very\nbadly. (Note that, as is standard in dynamic choice theory, the\ndiscussion in this entry leaves room for non-selfish preferences and\nconcerns; it thus leaves room for the possibility that one can be\ndetermined to serve one\u2019s preferences and concerns as well as\npossible without being an egoist.)\n",
