    "main_text": "Understanding Constructive Empiricism || Contrast with Scientific Realism\n1.1 Contrast with Scientific Realism\n\nConstructive empiricism is a view which stands in contrast to the type\nof scientific realism that claims the following:\n\nScience aims to give us, in its theories, a literally true story of\nwhat the world is like; and acceptance of a scientific theory involves\nthe belief that it is true. (van Fraassen 1980, 8)\n\n\nIn contrast, the constructive empiricist holds that science aims at\ntruth about observable aspects of the world, but that science does not\naim at truth about unobservable aspects. Acceptance of a theory,\naccording to constructive empiricism, correspondingly differs from\nacceptance of a theory on the scientific realist view: the\nconstructive empiricist holds that as far as belief is concerned,\nacceptance of a scientific theory involves only the belief that the\ntheory is empirically adequate.\n",
