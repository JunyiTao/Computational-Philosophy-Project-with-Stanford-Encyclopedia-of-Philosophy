It is\nargued that elementary acts of consciousness are non-algorithmic,\ni.e., non-computable, and they are neurophysiologically realized as\ngravitation-induced reductions of coherent superposition states in\nmicrotubuli.\n\nUnlike the approaches discussed so far, which are essentially based on\n(different features of) status quo quantum theory, the\nphysical part of the scenario, proposed by Penrose, refers to future\ndevelopments of quantum theory for a proper understanding of the\nphysical process underlying quantum state reduction. The grander\npicture is that a full-blown theory of quantum gravity is required to\nultimately understand quantum measurement (see the entry on\n quantum gravity).\n\nThis is a far-reaching assumption. Penrose\u2019s rationale for\ninvoking state reduction is not that the corresponding randomness\noffers room for mental causation to become efficacious (although this\nis not excluded). His conceptual starting point, at length developed\nin two books (Penrose 1989, 1994), is that elementary conscious acts\ncannot be described algorithmically, hence cannot be computed. His\nbackground in this respect has a lot to do with the nature of\ncreativity, mathematical insight, G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems, and the idea of a Platonic reality beyond mind and\nmatter.\n\nPenrose argues that a valid formulation of quantum state reduction\nreplacing von Neumann\u2019s projection postulate must faithfully\ndescribe an objective physical process that he calls\nobjective reduction. As such a physical process remains\nempirically unconfirmed so far, Penrose proposes that effects not\ncurrently covered by quantum theory could play a role in state\nreduction. Ideal candidates for him are gravitational effects since\ngravitation is the only fundamental interaction which is not\nintegrated into quantum theory so far. Rather than modifying elements\nof the theory of gravitation (i.e., general relativity) to achieve\nsuch an integration, Penrose discusses the reverse: that novel\nfeatures have to be incorporated in quantum theory for this purpose.\nIn this way, he arrives at the proposal of gravitation-induced\nobjective state reduction.\n\nWhy is such a version of state reduction non-computable? Initially one\nmight think of objective state reduction in terms of a stochastic\nprocess, as most current proposals for such mechanisms indeed do (see\nthe entry on\n collapse theories).\n This would certainly be indeterministic, but probabilistic and\nstochastic processes can be standardly implemented on a computer,\nhence they are definitely computable. Penrose (1994, Secs 7.8 and\n7.10) sketches some ideas concerning genuinely non-computable, not\nonly random, features of quantum gravity. In order for them to become\nviable candidates for explaining the non-computability of\ngravitation-induced state reduction, a long way still has to be\ngone.\n\nWith respect to the neurophysiological implementation of\nPenrose\u2019s proposal, his collaboration with Hameroff has been\ninstrumental. With his background as an anaesthesiologist, Hameroff\nsuggested to consider microtubules as an option for where reductions\nof quantum states can take place in an effective way, see e.g.,\nHameroff and Penrose (1996). The respective quantum states are assumed\nto be coherent superpositions of tubulin states, ultimately extending\nover many neurons. Their simultaneous gravitation-induced collapse is\ninterpreted as an individual elementary act of consciousness. The\nproposed mechanism by which such superpositions are established\nincludes a number of involved details that remain to be confirmed or\ndisproven.\n\nThe idea of focusing on microtubuli is partly motivated by the\nargument that special locations are required to ensure that quantum\nstates can live long enough to become reduced by gravitational\ninfluence rather than by interactions with the warm and wet\nenvironment within the brain. Speculative remarks about how the\nnon-computable aspects of the expected new physics mentioned above\ncould be significant in this\n scenario[13]\n are given in Penrose (1994, Sec. 7.7).\n\nInfluential criticism of the possibility that quantum states can in\nfact survive long enough in the thermal environment of the brain has\nbeen raised by Tegmark (2000). He estimates the decoherence time of\ntubulin superpositions due to interactions in the brain to be less\nthan 10-12 sec. Compared to typical time scales of\nmicrotubular processes of the order of milliseconds and more, he\nconcludes that the lifetime of tubulin superpositions is much too\nshort to be significant for neurophysiological processes in the\nmicrotubuli. In a response to this criticism, Hagan et al.\n(2002) showed that a corrected version of Tegmark\u2019s model\nprovides decoherence times up to 10 to 100 \u03bcsec, and it has been\nargued that this can be extended up to the neurophysiologically\nrelevant range of 10 to 100 msec under particular assumptions of the\nscenario by Penrose and Hameroff.\n\nMore recently, a novel idea has entered this debate. Theoretical\nstudies of interacting spins have shown that entangled states can be\nmaintained in noisy open quantum systems at high temperature and far\nfrom thermal equilibrium. In these studies the effect of decoherence\nis counterbalanced by a simple \u201crecoherence\u201d mechanism\n(Hartmann et al. 2006, Li and Paraoanu 2009). This indicates\nthat, under particular circumstances, entanglement may persist even in\nhot and noisy environments such as the brain.\n\nHowever, decoherence is just one piece in the debate about the overall\npicture suggested by Penrose and Hameroff. From another perspective,\ntheir proposal of microtubules as quantum computing devices has\nrecently received support from work of Bandyopadhyay\u2019s lab at\nJapan, showing evidence for vibrational resonances and conductivity\nfeatures in microtubules that should be expected if they are\nmacroscopic quantum systems (Sahu et al. 2013).\nBandyopadhyay\u2019s results initiated considerable attention and\ncommentary (see Hameroff and Penrose 2014). In a well-informed\nin-depth analysis, Pitk\u00e4nen (2014) raised concerns to the effect\nthat the reported results alone may not be sufficient to confirm the\napproach proposed by Hameroff and Penrose with all its\nramifications.\n\nIn a different vein, Craddock et al. (2015, 2017) discussed\nin detail how microtubular processes (rather than, or in addition to,\nsynaptic processes, see Flohr 2000) may be affected by anesthetics,\nand may also be responsible for neurodegenerative memory disorders. As\nthe correlation between anesthetics and consciousness seems obvious at\nthe phenomenological level, it is interesting to know the intricate\nmechanisms by which anesthetic drugs act on the cytoskeleton of\nneuronal\n cells,[14]\n and what role quantum mechanics plays in these mechanisms. Craddock\net al. (2015, 2017) point out a number of possible quantum\neffects (including the power-law behavior addressed by Vitiello, cf.\n Section 3.3)\n which can be investigated using presently available technologies.\nRecent empirical results about quantum interactions of anesthetics are\ndue to Li et al. (2018) and Burdick et al. (2019).\n\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, the scenario of Penrose and Hameroff\nhas occasionally received outspoken rejection, see e.g., Grush and\nChurchland (1995) and the reply by Penrose and Hameroff (1995).\nIndeed, their approach collects several top level mysteries, among\nthem the relation between mind and matter itself, the ultimate\nunification of all physical interactions, the origin of mathematical\ntruth, and the understanding of brain dynamics across hierarchical\nlevels. Combining such deep and fascinating issues certainly needs\nfurther work to be substantiated, and should neither be too quickly\ncelebrated nor offhandedly dismissed. After more than two decades\nsince its inception one thing can be safely asserted: the approach has\nfruitfully inspired important innovative research on quantum effects\non consciousness, both theoretical and empirical. \n",
