    "main_text": "Arguments about markets || \u201cThe market\u201d versus different markets\n3.3 \u201cThe market\u201d versus different markets\n\nAs will have become clear, some arguments for and against markets\ndirectly respond to one another, whereas others have to be weighed\nagainst one another without being directly compatible. Many thinkers\nacknowledge the force of at least some arguments from both sides. They\ntake the line described in section 2 as \u201cqualified\nendorsement\u201d and argue for the market as one element\nwithin an institutional framework that can mitigate some of its more\nproblematic effects. It should be kept in mind, however, that\ndifferent markets can look very different with regard to the arguments\nlisted above. This raises the question of whether it is possible at\nall to say something general about the value of \u201cmarkets\u201d,\nrather than about specific markets in specific situations. A common\nproblem in the discussion about markets is the level of abstraction,\nas many abstract models make idealizing assumptions that do not hold\nin real life (see also Phillips\n 2008).[8]\n While there is nothing wrong as such with using abstract models, it\nis important to consider their limited validity in real life\ninstantiations. When comparing markets to other institutional\nsolutions, the comparison has to take place at the same level of\nabstraction. Otherwise one compares apples to oranges, e.g., when a\nvery imperfect market with great asymmetries of power is contrasted\nwith an idealized public bureaucracy, or when a market in which all\nindividuals are fully rational is contrasted with corrupt public\ninstitutions. It makes more sense to compare a reasonably\nwell-functioning market with a reasonably well-functioning\nbureaucracy. \n\nAnother problem in debates about markets is the following: If critical\narguments against markets are raised, defenders of markets sometimes\nhold that the ills should not be blamed on markets, but rather on the\nsurrounding institutions, because the conditions that would need to\nhold for markets to do their beneficial work are not fulfilled. For\nexample, when markets are criticized for leading to an overconsumption\nof natural resources, defenders of markets often point out that there\nare no full property rights for many environmental goods. If\nenvironmental goods had a price, it would be expensive to use them,\nand their owners would have incentives to treat them in responsible\nways (see e.g., Tomasi\u2019s reply to the \u201ctragedy of the\ncommons\u201d (2012, 259ff.)). One might retort, however, that in\nmany cases having such property rights would not solve the problem,\nbecause the transaction costs of finding bargaining solutions would be\ntoo high. Such examples show that the value of concrete markets can\noften not be discussed in purely abstract terms \u2013 what they are\nand what effects they have crucially depends on the institutions that\nsurround them. These will be discussed next.\n",
