It\nhas sometimes been suggested that he was effectively under\n\u201chouse arrest,\u201d but this seems an exaggeration. On the\ncontrary, he appears to have been free to do more or less as he\npleased, although of course he did have to be \u201con hand\u201d in\ncase the investigating commission wanted to question him about his\nwritings. The investigation must not have demanded much of\nOckham\u2019s own time, since he was able to work on a number of\nother projects while he was in Avignon, including finishing his last\nmajor theological work, the Quodlibets. It should be pointed\nout that, although there were some stern pronouncements that came out\nof the investigation of Ockham, his views were never officially\ncondemned as heretical.\n\nIn 1327, Michael of Cesena, the Franciscan \u201cMinister\nGeneral\u201d (the chief administrative officer of the order)\nlikewise came to Avignon, in his case because of an emerging\ncontroversy between the Franciscans and the current Pope, John XXII,\nover the idea of \u201cApostolic poverty,\u201d the view that Jesus\nand the Apostles owned no property at all of their own but, like the\nmendicant Franciscans, went around begging and living off the\ngenerosity of others. The Franciscans held this view, and maintained\nthat their own practices were a special form of \u201cimitation of\nChrist.\u201d Pope John XXII rejected the doctrine, which is why\nMichael of Cesena was in Avignon.\n\nThings came to a real crisis in 1328, when Michael and the Pope had a\nserious confrontation over the matter. As a result, Michael asked\nOckham to study the question from the point of view of previous papal\nstatements and John\u2019s own previous writings on the subject. When\nhe did so, Ockham came to the conclusion, apparently somewhat to his\nown surprise, that John\u2019s view was not only wrong but outright\nheretical. Furthermore, the heresy was not just an honest mistake; it\nwas stubbornly heretical, a view John maintained even\nafter he had been shown it was wrong. As a result, Ockham argued,\nPope John was not just teaching heresy, but was a heretic himself in\nthe strongest possible sense, and had therefore effectively abdicated\nhis papacy. In short, Pope John XXII was no pope at all!\n\nClearly, things had become intolerable for Ockham in Avignon.\n",
