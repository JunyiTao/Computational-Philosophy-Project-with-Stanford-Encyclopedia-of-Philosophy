Both basic science and\ntechnological feat, the Human Genome Project (HGP) sought to map and\nsequence the haploid human genome\u2019s 22 autosomes and 2 sex\nchromosomes, bringing to biology a \u201cbig science\u201d model\npreviously confined to physics. Officially launched in October 1990,\nthe project\u2019s official date of completion was timed to coincide\nwith celebrations of the 50th anniversary of James D.\nWatson and Francis Crick\u2019s discovery of the double-helical\nstructure of DNA. On 12 April 2003, heads of government of the six\ncountries that contributed to the sequencing efforts (the U.S., the\nU.K., Japan, France, Germany, and China) issued a joint proclamation\nthat the \u201cessential sequence of three billion base pairs of DNA\nof the Human Genome, the molecular instruction book of human\nlife,\u201d had been achieved (Dept. of Trade 2003). HGP researchers\ncompared their feat to the Apollo moon landing and splitting the atom.\nThey foresaw the dawn of a new era, \u201cthe era of the\ngenome,\u201d in which the genome sequence would provide a\n\u201ctremendous foundation on which to build the science and\nmedicine of the 21st century\u201d (NHGRI 2003).\n\nThis article begins by providing a brief history of the Human Genome\nProject. An overview of various scientific developments that unfolded\nin the aftermath of the HGP follows; these developments came to be\nreferred to as \u201cpostgenomics\u201d to distinguish them from\nactivities labelled \u201cgenomics\u201d that are associated\nspecifically with the mapping and sequencing of the genomes of humans\nand other organisms. The article then discusses some of the conceptual\nand social and ethical issues that gained the attention of\nphilosophers during the project\u2019s planning stages and as it\nunfolded, and which remain salient today. Novel with the HGP was the\ndecision of its scientific leadership to set aside funds to study the\nproject\u2019s ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). Today,\nfrom a vantage point more than two-and-a-half decades after that\ndecision was made, it is possible to reflect on the ELSI model and its\nrelevance for ongoing biomedical research in genetics and\ngenomics/postgenomics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Human Genome Project: From Genomics to Postgenomics\n1.1 Map First, Sequence Later\n\nThe idea of sequencing the entire human genome arose in the U.S. in\nthe mid-1980s and is attributed to University of California at Santa\nCruz chancellor Robert Sinsheimer, Salk Institute researcher Renato\nDulbecco, and the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE\u2019s) Charles\nDeLisi. While the idea found supporters among prominent molecular\nbiologists and human geneticists such as Walter Bodmer, Walter\nGilbert, Leroy Hood, Victor McKusick, and James D. Watson, many of\ntheir colleagues expressed misgivings. There were concerns among\nmolecular biologists about the routine nature of sequencing and the\namount of \u201cjunk DNA\u201d that would be sequenced, that the\nexpense and big science approach would drain resources from smaller\nand more worthy projects, and that knowledge of gene sequence was\ninadequate to yield knowledge of gene function (Davis and Colleagues\n1990).\n\nCommittees established to study the feasibility of a publicly funded\nproject to sequence the human genome released reports in 1988 that\nresponded to these concerns. The Office for Technology Assessment\nreport, Mapping Our Genes: Genome Projects: How Big, How\nFast? downplayed the concerns of scientist critics by emphasizing\nthat there was not one but many genome projects, that these were not\non the scale of the Manhattan or Apollo projects, that no agency was\ncommitted to massive sequencing, and that the study of other organisms\nwas needed to understand human genes. The National Research Council\nreport, Mapping and Sequencing the Human Genome, sought to\naccommodate the scientists\u2019 concerns by formulating\nrecommendations that genetic and physical mapping and the development\nof cheaper, more efficient sequencing technologies precede large-scale\nsequencing, and that funding be provided for the mapping and\nsequencing of nonhuman (\u201cmodel\u201d) organisms as well. Genome\nprojects were underway even before the Office for Technology\nAssessment and National Research Council reports were released. The\nDOE made the first push toward a \u201cbig science\u201d genome\nproject, with DeLisi advancing a five-year plan in 1986. The DOE\nundertaking produced consternation among biomedical researchers who\nwere traditionally supported by the National Institutes of\nHealth\u2019s (NIH\u2019s) intramural and extramural programs, and\nJames Wyngaarden, head of the NIH, was persuaded to lend his\nagency\u2019s support to the project in 1987. Congressional funding\nfor both agencies was in place in time for fiscal year 1988. The\nNational Research Council report estimated the total cost of the HGP\nat $3 billion.\n\nThe DOE and NIH coordinated their efforts with a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding in 1988 that agreed on an official launch of the Human\nGenome Project on October 1, 1990 and an expected date of completion\nof 2005. The DOE established three genome centers in 1988\u201389: at\nLawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos National\nLaboratories. David Smith led the DOE-HGP at the outset; he was\nfollowed by David Galas from 1990 to 1993, and Ari Patrinos for the\nremainder of the project. The NIH instituted a university grant-based\nprogram for human genome research and placed Watson, co-discoverer of\nthe structure of DNA and director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in\ncharge in 1988. In October 1989, Watson assumed the helm of the newly\nestablished National Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) at the\nNIH. During 1990 and 1991, Watson expanded the grants-based program to\nfund seven genome centers for five-year periods to work on large-scale\nmapping projects: Washington University, St. Louis; University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco; Massachusetts Institute of Technology;\nUniversity of Michigan; University of Utah; Baylor College of\nMedicine; and Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Francis\nCollins succeeded Watson in 1993, establishing an intramural research\nprogram at the NCHGR to complement the extramural program of grants\nfor university-based research that already existed. In 1997, the NCHGR\nwas elevated to the status of a research institute and renamed the\nNational Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).\n\nAlthough the HGP\u2019s inceptions were in the U.S., it did not take\nlong for mapping and sequencing the human genome to become an\ninternational venture (see Cook-Deegan 1994). France began to fund\ngenome research in 1988 and had developed a more centralized, although\nnot very well-funded, program by 1990. More significant were the\ncontributions of Centre d\u2019Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)\nand G\u00e9n\u00e9thon. CEPH, founded in 1983 by Jean Dausset,\nmaintained a collection of DNA donated by intergenerational families\nto help in the study of hereditary disease; in 1991, with funding from\nthe French muscular dystrophy association, CEPH director Daniel Cohen\noversaw the launching of G\u00e9n\u00e9thon as an industrial-sized\nmapping and sequencing operation. The U.K.\u2019s genome project\nreceived its official start in 1989, though Sydney Brenner had\ncommenced genome research at the Medical Research Council laboratory\nseveral years before this. Medical Research Council funding was\nsupplemented with private monies from the Imperial Cancer Research\nFund and, later, the Wellcome Trust. The Sanger Centre, led by John\nSulston and funded by Wellcome and the Medical Research Council,\nopened in October 1993. Japan, ahead of the U.S. in having funded the\ndevelopment of automated sequencing technologies since the early\n1980s, was the major genome player outside the U.S. and Europe with\nseveral government agencies beginning small-scale genome projects in\nthe late-1980s and early-1990s (Swinbanks 1991). Germany and China\nsubsequently joined the U.S., France, U.K., and Japan in the publicly\nfunded international consortium that was ultimately responsible for\nsequencing the genome.\n\nThe NIH and DOE released a joint five-year plan in 1990 that set\nspecific benchmarks for mapping, sequencing, and technological\ndevelopment. The plan was updated in 1993 to accommodate progress that\nhad been made, with the new five-year plan in effect through 1998\n(Collins and Galas 1993). As the National Research Council report had\nrecommended, priority at the outset of the project was given to\nmapping rather than sequencing the human genome. HGP scientists sought\nto construct two kinds of maps: genetic maps and physical maps.\nGenetic maps order polymorphic markers linearly on chromosomes; the\naim is to have these markers densely enough situated that linkage\nrelations can be used to locate chromosomal regions containing genes\nof interest to researchers. Physical maps order collections (or\n\u201clibraries\u201d) of cloned DNA fragments that cover an\norganism\u2019s genome; these fragments can then be replicated in\nquantity for sequencing. Technological progress was needed to make\nsequencing more efficient and less costly for any significant progress\nto be made. For the meantime, efforts would focus on sequencing the\nsmaller genomes of less complex model organisms (Watson 1990). The\nmodel organisms selected for the project were the bacterium\nEscherichia coli, the yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, the\nfruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, and the mouse Mus\nmusculans.\n\nAs 1998, the last year of the revised five-year plan and midpoint of\nthe project\u2019s projected 15-year span, approached, many mapping\ngoals had been met. In 1994, G\u00e9n\u00e9thon completed a\ngenetic map with more than 2,000 microsatellite markers at an average\nspacing of 2.9 centimorgans (cM) and only one gap larger than 20 cM\n(Gyapay et al. 1994); the goal was a resolution of 2 to 5 cM by 2005.\nThe genetic mapping phase of the project came to a final close in\nMarch 1996 with G\u00e9n\u00e9thon\u2019s completion of a genetic\nmap containing 5,264 microsatellite markers located to 2,335 positions\nwith an average spacing of 1.6 cM (Dib et al. 1996). In 1995, a\nphysical map with 94 percent coverage of the genome and 15,086\nsequence-tagged site (STS) markers at average intervals of 199\nkilobases (kb) was published (Hudson et al. 1995); the initial goal\nwas STS markers spaced approximately 100 kb apart by 1995, a deadline\nthe revised plan extended to 1998. In 1998, a physical map of 41,664\nSTS markers was published (Deloukas et al. 1998). Sequencing presented\nmore of a challenge, despite ramped-up sequencing efforts over the\nprevious several years at the U.K.\u2019s Wellcome Trust-funded\nSanger Centre in Cambridge and the NHGRI (previously NCHGR)-funded\ncenters at Houston\u2019s Baylor College of Medicine, Stanford\nUniversity, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), University of\nWashington-Seattle, Washington University School of Medicine in St.\nLouis, and Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research/MIT Genome\nCenter. The genomes of the smallest model organisms had been\nsequenced. In April 1996, an international consortium of mostly\nEuropean laboratories published the sequence for S.\ncerevisiae which was the first eukaryote completed, with 12\nmillion base pairs and 5,885 genes and at a cost of $40 million\n(Goffeau et al. 1996). In January 1997, University of Wisconsin\nresearchers completed the sequence of E. coli with 4,638,858\nbase pairs and 4,286 genes (Blattner et al. 1997). However, with only\nthree percent of the human genome sequenced, sequencing costs hovering\nat $.40/base, and the desired high output not yet achieved by the\nsequencing centers, and about $1.8 billion spent, doubts existed about\nwhether the HGP\u2019s target date of 2005 could be met.\n1.2 Race to the Genome\n\nSuddenly, the publicly funded HGP faced a challenge from the private\nsector. In May 1998, TIGR\u2019s J. Craig Venter announced a\npartnership with Applied Biosystems to sequence the entire genome in\nthree short years and for a fraction of the cost. The new company,\nbased in Rockville, MD and later named Celera Genomics, planned to use\n\u201cwhole-genome shotgun\u201d (WGS) sequencing, an approach\ndifferent from the HGP\u2019s. The HGP confined the shotgun method to\ncloned fragments already mapped to specific chromosomal regions: these\nare broken down into smaller bits then amplified by bacterial clones,\nsequences are generated randomly by automated machines, and\ncomputational resources are used to reassemble sequence using\noverlapping areas of bits. Shotgunning is followed by painstaking\n\u201cfinishing\u201d to fill in gaps, correct mistakes, and resolve\nambiguities. What Celera was proposing for the shotgun method was to\nbreak the organism\u2019s entire genome into millions of pieces of\nDNA with high-frequency sound waves, sequence these pieces using\nhundreds of Applied Biosystem\u2019s new capillary model machines,\nand reassemble the sequences with one of the world\u2019s largest\ncivilian supercomputers without the assistance provided by the\npreliminary mapping of clones to chromosomes. When WGS sequencing was\nconsidered as a possibility by the HGP, it was rejected because of the\nrisk that repeat sequences would yield mistakes in reassembly (Green\n1997; Venter et al. 1996; Weber and Myers 1997). But Venter by this\ntime had successfully used the method to sequence the 1.83 million\nnucleotide bases of the bacterium Hemophilus\ninfluenzae\u2014the first free-living organism to be completely\nsequenced\u2014in a year\u2019s time (Fleischmann et al. 1995).\n\nHGP scientists downplayed the media image of a race to sequence the\ngenome often over the next couple of years, but they were certainly\npropelled by worries that funding would dry up before the sequence was\ncomplete given private sector willingness to take over and that the\nsequence data would become proprietary information. Wellcome more than\ndoubled its funds to the Sanger Centre (to \u00a3205 million) and the\ncenter changed its goal from sequencing one-sixth of the genome to\nsequencing one-third, and possibly one-half (Dickson 1998). The NHGRI\nand DOE published a new five-year plan for 1998-2003 (Collins et al.\n1998). The plan moved the final completion date forward from 2005 to\n2003 and aimed for a \u201cworking draft\u201d of the human genome\nsequence to be completed by December 2001. This would be achieved by\ndelaying the finishing process, no longer going clone-by-clone to\nshotgun, reassemble, and finish the sequence of one clone before\nproceeding to the next. With only six percent of the human genome\nsequence completed, the plan called for new and improved sequencing\ntechnologies that could increase the sequencing capacity from 90 Mb\nper year at about $.50 per base to 500 Mb per year at no more than\n$.25 per base. Goals for completing the sequencing of the remaining\nmodel organisms were also set: December 1998 for C. elegans\nwhich was 80 percent complete, 2002 for D. melanogaster which\nwas nine percent complete, and 2005 for M. musculus which was\nstill at the physical mapping stage.\n\nAn interim victory for the publicly funded project followed when, on\nschedule, the first animal sequence, that of C. elegans with\n97 million bases and 19,099 genes, was published in Science\nin December 1998 (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998).\nThis was the product of a 10-year collaboration between scientists at\nWashington University in St. Louis (headed by Bob Waterston) and the\nSanger Centre (headed by John Sulston), carried out at a\nsemi-industrial scale with more than 200 people employed in each lab\nworking around the clock. In March 1999, the main players\u2014the\nNHGRI, Sanger Centre, and DOE\u2014advanced the date of completion of\nthe \u201cworking draft\u201d: five-fold coverage of at least 90\npercent of the genome was to be completed by the following spring\n(Pennisi 1999; Wadman 1999). This change reflected improved output of\nthe new model of automated sequencing machines, diminished sequencing\ncosts at $.20 to $.30 per base, and the desire to speed up the release\nof medically relevant data. NHGRI would take responsibility for 60\npercent of the sequence, concentrating these efforts at Baylor,\nWashington University, and Whitehead/MIT; 33 percent of the sequence\nwould be the responsibility of the Sanger Centre; and the remaining\nsequence would be supplied by the DOE\u2019s Joint Genome Institute\n(JGI) in Walnut Creek, CA into which its three centers had merged in\nJanuary 1997.\n\nThe first chromosomes to be completed (this was to finished, not\nworking draft, standards) were the two smallest: the sequence for\nchromosome 22 was published by scientists at the Sanger Centre and\npartners at University of Oklahoma, Washington University in St.\nLouis, and Keio University in Japan in December 1999 (Dunham et al.\n1999); the sequence for chromosome 21 was published by an\ninternational consortium of mostly Japanese and German labs\u2014with\nhalf the sequencing carried out at Japan\u2019s RIKEN\u2014in May\n2000 (Hattori et al. 2000). The remaining chromosomes lagged behind.\nOn 26 June 2000, when Collins, Venter, and the DOE\u2019s Patrinos\njoined U.S. President Bill Clinton (and British Prime Minister Tony\nBlair by satellite link) at a White House press conference (see\nClinton, et al. 2000) to announce that the human genome had been\nsequenced, this was more an arranged truce than a tie for the prize.\nAn editorial in Nature described the fanfare of 26 June as an\n\u201cextravagant\u201d example\u2014one reaching \u201can all-out\nzenith or nadir, according to taste\u201d\u2014of scientists making\npublic announcements not linked to peer-reviewed publication, here to\nbolster share prices (Celera) and for political effect (the HGP) given\nthe \u201cmonths to go before even a draft sequence will be\nscientifically useful\u201d (Anonymous 2000, p. 981). Neither of the\ntwo sequence maps was complete (Pennisi 2000). The HGP had not met its\nprevious year\u2019s goal of a working draft covering 90 percent of\nthe genome. Assisted by its researchers\u2019 access to HGP data\nstored on public\n databases,[1]\n Celera\u2019s efforts were accepted as being further along: the\ncompany\u2019s press release that day announced 99 percent coverage\nof the genome.\n\nPeer-reviewed publications came almost eight months later. Negotiated\nplans for joint publication in Science broke down when terms\nof agreement over data release could not be negotiated, with the\njournal\u2019s editors willing to publish Celera\u2019s findings\nwithout Venter meeting the standard requirement that the sequence data\nbe submitted to GenBank. Press conferences in London and Washington,\nD.C. on 12 February preceded publications that week\u2014by HGP\nscientists in Nature on 15 February 2001 and by\nVenter\u2019s team in Science on 16 February 2001. The HGP\ndraft genome sequence covered about 94 percent of the genome, with\nabout 25 percent in the finished form already attained for chromosomes\n21 and 22. Indeed, the authors themselves described it as \u201can\nincomplete, intermediate product\u201d which \u201ccontains many\ngaps and errors\u201d (International Human Genome Sequencing\nConsortium 2001, p. 871). The results published by Celera had\n84\u201390 percent of the genome covered by scaffolds at least 100 kb\nin length, with the composition of the scaffolds averaging 91\u201392\npercent sequence and 8\u20139 percent gaps (Venter et al. 2001). In\nthe end, Celera\u2019s published genome assembly made significant use\nof the HGP\u2019s publicly available map and sequence data, which\nleft open for debate the question whether WGS sequencing alone would\nhave worked (see Waterston et al. 2002; Green 2002; and Myers et al.\n2002).\n\nSince the gaps in the sequence were unlikely to contain genes, and\nonly genes as functional segments of DNA have potential commercial\nvalue, Celera was happy to leave the gaps for the HGP scientists to\nfill in. Despite being timed to coincide with celebrations of the\n50th anniversary of the Watson\u2013Crick discovery of the\ndouble-helical structure of DNA, there was less fanfare surrounding\nthe official date of completion of the HGP in April 2003, two years\nearlier than had been anticipated at the time of its official launch\nin October 1990, and several months earlier than called for in the\nmost recent five-year plan. In the end, sequencing\u2014the third\nphase of the publicly-funded project\u2014was carried out at 16\ncenters in six countries by divvying up among them sections of\nchromosomes for sequencing. 85 percent of the sequencing, however, was\ndone at the five major sequencing centers (Baylor, Washington\nUniversity, Whitehead/MIT, Sanger Center, and DOE\u2019s JGI), with\nthe Sanger Centre responsible for nearly one-third. The cost was lower\nthan anticipated, with $2.7 billion spent by U.S. agencies and\n\u00a3150 million spent by Wellcome Trust. The \u201cfinished\u201d\nreference DNA sequence for Homo sapiens was made publicly\naccessible on the Internet. However, for various technical reasons,\nthe human genome\u2019s 3.1 billion nucleotide bases had not yet been\ncompletely sequenced at the close of the HGP in\n 2003.[2]\n1.3 Aftermath\n\nPublic support was won for the HGP through scientists\u2019 promises\nof the revolutionary benefits of genome-based research for\npharmaceutical and other biomedical applications. At the outset of the\nHGP, these promises were sometimes alarmingly deterministic,\nreductionistic, and overblown, such as when Science editor\nDaniel Koshland (1989) submitted that genes are responsible not only\nfor manic-depression and schizophrenia but also poverty and\nhomelessness, and that sequencing the genome represented \u201ca\ngreat new technology to aid the poor, the infirm, and the\nunderprivileged\u201d (p. 189). More circumspect claims by\nscientist-proponents of the HGP were no less optimistic. Leroy Hood\nexpressed the belief that \u201cwe will learn more about human\ndevelopment and pathology in the next twenty-five years than we have\nin the past two thousand\u201d (1992, p. 163). Hood expected the HGP\nto facilitate movement from a reactive to preventive mode of medicine,\nwhich would \u201cenable most individuals to live a normal, healthy,\nand intellectually alert life without disease\u201d (p. 158). Francis\nCollins predicted that sequencing the genome would \u201cdramatically\naccelerate the development of new strategies for the diagnosis,\nprevention, and treatment of disease, not just for single-gene\ndisorders but for the host of more common complex diseases (e.g.,\ndiabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia, and cancer)\u201d (1999, p.\n29). Collins envisioned that, by 2010, genetically-based\n\u201cindividualized medicine\u201d would be a reality: physicians\nwould routinely take cheek swabs from patients and send their DNA out\nfor testing; based on results of genetic testing (returned within a\nweek), physicians would be able to advise their patients about their\nabsolute and relative risks for contracting various adult-onset\ndiseases; by taking preventive measures (e.g., quitting smoking,\nhaving an annual colonoscopy, etc.), patients would be able to prevent\nthe onset of any such diseases or minimize their effects; and the\nfield of pharmacogenomics would have \u201cblossomed\u201d\nsufficiently for physicians to be able to prescribe prophylactic\nmedications tailored precisely to the genetic make-up of their\npatients, so to promote efficacy and prevent adverse reactions.\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS), in which single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome are compared in\ncase\u2013control fashion, are the main approach used to investigate\nthe genetic bases of complex traits. The importance of developing\nrapid, inexpensive methods of genome sequencing and building a\ndatabase of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to support the\ninvestigation of complex traits was recognized by the project\u2019s\nleadership even before completion of the HGP. Worried about the\nprivate sector\u2019s efforts to patent SNPs, which would make them\ncostly to use for research, the NHGRI-DOE\u2019s five-year plan for\n1998\u20132003 included the goal of mapping 100,000 SNPs by 2003\n(Collins et al. 1998). The development of a public database of SNPs\nreceived a $138 million push from the International HapMap Project, a\nthree-year public-private partnership completed in 2005 that mapped\nvariation in four population groups (The International HapMap\nConsortium 2005). The 1000 Genomes Project, which ran between 2008 and\n2015 (Birney and Soranzo 2015), sought to identify genetic variants\nthat occur with a frequency of at least one percent in the populations\nstudied, with the final data set consisting of 2,504 individuals from\n26 populations from five continental regions.\n\nThe first genome-wide association study was published in 2005; by\n2010, 500 genome-wide association studies had been published (Green et\nal. 2011); and by 2018, more than 5,000 genome-wide association\nstudies had been published and their results added to the GWAS Catalog\n(Buniello et al. 2019). Despite these efforts, variants isolated by\nGWAS for complex traits account for a low percentage of heritability\nassociated with the traits, a phenomenon known as \u201cmissing\nheritability\u201d (Maher 2008). Although knowledge of the\npathogenesis of common complex diseases such as diabetes, heart\ndisease, schizophrenia, and cancer that arise due to the interaction\nof numerous genetic and nongenetic factors is lacking despite the\nnumerous GWAS completed, the pathogenesis of so-called single-gene\ndisorders is far better understood. Aided by the HGP\u2019s dense map\nof genetic markers for use in positional mapping and subsequent\ndevelopment of genome-wide sequencing technologies, since the draft\nsequence was published 20 years ago, the number of Mendelian diseases\nwith a known genetic basis has increased from 1,257 to 4,377 (Alkuraya\n2021). This progress speeds up clinical diagnosis and facilitates\nprenatal genetic testing. Prevention and treatment remain challenging,\nhowever. There are only 59 \u201cactionable genes\u201d on the\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\u2019 most recent\nlist of genes that are highly penetrant and associated with\nestablished interventions (Kalia et al. 2017). Gene therapy, touted as\na potential cure for such disorders, yielded discouraging results in\ntrials; only with the discovery of CRISPR, a novel technology of gene\nediting, has optimism been restored, though how well this basic\nscience translates into clinical applications is yet to be seen\n(Doudna and Sternberg 2017; Baylis 2019).\n\nThe confident claims of leading genome scientists such as Hood and\nCollins proved to be overly so. Commentary at the time of the 10-year\nanniversary of completion of the HGP showed unison among scientists in\nrecognizing that the promised revolution had not yet arrived. The HGP\nhas been advanced as a case study in support of the \u201csocial\nbubble\u201d hypothesis: the hypothesis that people will dive into\nnew opportunities that present without due regard for potential risks\nbecause they are carried along by social interactions driven by\nenthusiasts who generate high expectations of returns\u2014for the\nHGP, projections of commercially lucrative pharmaceutical and other\nbiomedical applications advanced by project proponents (Gisler et al.\n2010). The scientific consensus appears to be that although the HGP\nfailed at least in the short term to fulfill proponents\u2019 overly\noptimistic prognostications for clinical applications, it has been a\nboon for basic science (Evans 2010). In the HGP\u2019s early years,\nNorton Zinder, who chaired the NIH\u2019s Program Advisory Committee\non the Human Genome, characterized it in this way: \u201cThis Project\nis creating an infrastructure for doing science; it\u2019s not the\ndoing of the science per se. It will provide the biological community\nwith the basic materials for doing research in human biology\u201d\n(in Cooper 1994, p. 74).\n\nIndeed, the infrastructure of mapping and sequencing technologies and\nbioinformatics that was developed as part of the HGP\u2014especially\nthe ability to sequence entire genomes of organisms and traffic in big\ndata\u2014has changed the way biology, not just human biology, is\ndone (Stevens 2013). It is recognized that genome structure by itself\ntells us only so much. Functional genomics places interest in how\nentire genomes\u2014not just individual genes\u2014function. A\nsurprising discovery of the HGP was that the number of coding genes in\nhumans is many orders smaller than what scientists had assumed at the\noutset of the project\u2014that is, around 20,000, as in other\nvertebrates, rather than 80,000\u2013100,000, though the final number\nremains an open question (Salzberg 2018). The majority of the\ngenome\u2019s DNA is transcribed but not translated and serves a\nregulatory function, with causal processes at the molecular level\nassociated with interactive networks not linear pathways. The\ndeterministic and reductionistic assumptions underlying the HGP that\nportrayed the genome as a blueprint for organismal development have\nbeen undermined by the research in molecular biology the project made\npossible (Keller 2000). Systems biology has emerged as a new\ndiscipline that seeks to understand this complexity by using\ncomputational methods (Hood 2003). In fact, since completion of the\nHGP, discovery of non-protein-coding elements of the genome and their\ncontributions to regulatory networks has far exceeded the discovery of\nprotein-coding genes (Gates et al. 2021). Evolutionary studies are\naided by the ability of scientists to compare the human genome\nreference sequence to reference sequences for close relatives, such as\nNeandertals (Green et al. 2010), bonobos (Mao et al. 2021), and\nchimpanzees (The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium\n2005).\n\nFor scientists to deliver on their promises for a revolution in\nmedicine, genome sequencing would need to be far faster, easier, and\ncheaper for its use to become routine in both research and clinical\nsettings. In the closing years of the HGP, the cost of sequencing a\nhuman genome using existing Sanger technology was about $100 million.\nWith high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology, in 2007,\nVenter\u2019s diploid genome was sequenced at a cost of $10 million,\nand by 2013, the cost of sequencing an average genome had been lowered\nto $5,000. These developments were aided by a NHGRI grant program that\nset its sights on a $1,000 genome, a price point believed to place the\n\u201cpersonal genome\u201d within reach for routine use (Check\nHayden 2014). Early in 2014, Illumina, a Californian company, claimed\na win in the contest, with availability of its HiSeq X Ten system for\npopulation-scale whole-genome sequencing initiatives (Sheridan 2014);\nin March 2016, Veritas Genetics, a company cofounded by Harvard\nmedical geneticist George M. Church, announced commercial availability\nof whole-genome sequencing for individuals, including interpretation\nand counseling, for $999 (Veritas Genetics 2016). Church had initiated\nthe Personal Genome Project in 2005 (Church 2005); there are now\nPersonal Genome Projects in Canada, the U.K., Austria, and China as\nwell. The projects recruit volunteers who are willing to support\nresearch by releasing their genomes and health and physical\ninformation publicly. Research that takes this longitudinal approach\ncombining genetic and clinical data is considered crucial for the\npromise of genomics to be fulfilled: with faster, easier, and cheaper\ngenome sequencing technologies, genetic data are readily obtainable,\nbut analysis of the data, without which there can be no revolution in\nmedicine, remains challenging.\n\nThe National Research Council\u2019s 2011 report saw the route to\n\u201cpersonalized medicine,\u201d or \u201cprecision\nmedicine\u201d as it was renamed (see Juengst et al. 2016 and\nFerryman and Pitcan 2018 for an account of that change), proceeding\nvia a \u201cNew Taxonomy\u201d of disease informed by two data\nrepositories: an \u201cInformation Commons\u201d that stores\nmolecular data (genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome,\nand epigenome) and additional information (phenotypes, treatment\noutcomes, test results, etc.) gleaned from the electronic health\nrecords of millions of individuals; and a \u201cKnowledge Network of\nDisease\u201d that integrates this information with\n\u201cfundamental biological knowledge.\u201d Disease\ngeneralizations would be \u201cbuilt up from\u201d this large number\nof individuals, a departure from studies that group individuals based\non particular characteristics (e.g., GWAS). Research efforts\napproaching the scale called for include the All of Us\nResearch Program in the U.S. and the UK Biobank. The data-intensive\napproach to molecular biology made possible by information technology\nneed not stop at electronic health records but could also include\nother electronic records such as credit card purchases and social\nmedia postings (Weber et al. 2014), and biometric measurements from\nmobile apps and fitness trackers (Shi and Wu 2017). The increased\nimportance of \u201cbig data\u201d is illustrated by contrasting\nfuturistic scenarios envisioned by Collins (1999) and Hood and Rowen\n(2013) almost 15 years apart. The \u201cindividualized\nmedicine\u201d circa 2010 forecasted by Collins is centered in the\nphysician\u2019s office and assumes a traditional view of the\ndoctor\u2013patient relationship. Hood and Rowen foresee individual\ngenome sequences playing a larger role in medical practice and a\nchanged doctor\u2013patient relationship, driven by\n\u201cpatients\u201d who are likely to bring consumer genetic data\nto their appointments and understand themselves to be active\nparticipants in their medical care. The new \u201cP4 medicine\u201d\nwill be not only predictive, preventive, and personalized, but\nparticipatory, and based on a data-driven systems approach to disease.\nWrite Hood and Rowen, \u201cWe envision a time in the future when all\npatients will be surrounded by a virtual cloud of billions of data\npoints, and when we will have the analytical tools to reduce this\nenormous data dimensionality to simple hypotheses to optimize wellness\nand minimize disease for each individual\u201d (p. 83). In the\nmeanwhile, as Jenny Reardon (2017) tells us, the vast expanse between\ndata and meaning characterizes \u201cthe postgenomic\ncondition.\u201d\n\nPhysicians are likely to encounter patients who bring consumer genetic\ndata to their appointments because of a development largely\nunanticipated by HGP proponents and critics alike: \u201cpersonal\ngenomics\u201d or \u201crecreational genomics.\u201d Efforts to\ncompile SNP databases and develop rapid, inexpensive, whole-genome\nsequencing technologies have not yet supported the dawn of a new era\nof personalized medicine and drug development guided by\npharmacogenomics, but direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomics has taken off\nas an industry, with profit-making seemingly unhampered by the lack of\ntreatments for diseases based on knowledge of DNA sequences. The first\nDTC whole-genome test was marketed in 2006 (Green at al. 2011). By\n2018, more than 10 million people had ordered DTC personal genomics\ntests (Khan and Mittelman 2018), and, that year, the NHGRI,\ncelebrating the HGP\u2019s 15th anniversary, identified\nDTC genetic testing as one of the \u201c15 for 15\u201d ways in\nwhich genomics is influencing the world. In 2019, the global DTC\ngenetic testing market was valued at over $1 billion and forecast to\nclimb to $3.4 billion by 2028 (Ugalmugle and Swain 2020). Although\nhealth and ancestry are the most common genetic tests sought, there is\na broad range of tests available, and DTC companies usually offer more\nthan one service (Phillips 2016). 23andMe and Ancestry.com, for\nexample, offer both health and ancestry tests. The family match\nfunction offered by these tests allows biological parentage to be\ndiscovered in cases of adoption and gamete donorship/sale. For people\nwho want to confirm paternity, out a cheating spouse, ascertain\nathletic ability, identify nutritional needs, or find a romantic\npartner, there are genetic tests and companies for those interests\ntoo.\n2. Philosophy and the Human Genome Project\n\nAt an October 1988 news conference called to announce his appointment,\nWatson, in an apparently off-the-cuff response to a reporter who asked\nabout the social implications of the project, promised that a portion\nof the funding would be set aside to study such issues (Marshall\n1996b). The result was the NIH/DOE Joint Working Group on Ethical,\nLegal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of Human Genome Research,\nchaired by Nancy Wexler, which began to meet in September 1989. The\nJoint Working Group identified four areas of high priority:\n\u201cquality and access in the use of genetic tests; fair use of\ngenetic information by employers and insurers; privacy and\nconfidentiality of genetic information; and public and professional\neducation\u201d (Wexler in Cooper 1994, p. 321). The NIH and DOE each\nestablished ELSI programs: philosopher Eric T. Juengst served as the\nfirst director of the NIH-NCHGR ELSI program from 1990 to 1994. ELSI\nwas funded initially to the tune of three percent of the HGP budget\nfor both agencies; this was increased to four and later five percent\nat the NIH, a huge boost in bioethics funding, on the order of tens of\nmillions of dollars each year.\n\nEthical issues such as genetic privacy, access to genetic testing, and\ngenetic discrimination were not the only considerations of interest to\nphilosophers, and besides ethicists, philosophers of science,\npolitical theorists and philosophers working in other areas benefited\nfrom ELSI-related funding. There is now a vast literature on human\ngenome-related topics. From among these topics, this section attempts\nto provide a synopsis of those that are most directly associated with\nthe HGP itself, of greatest concern and enduring interest to\nphilosophers, and not covered in other SEP entries. Since\nthere is interest in exporting the ELSI model to other biomedical\ncontexts, such as neuroscience, consideration is also given to its\nlegacy.\n2.1 Geneticization, Genetic Reductionism, and Genetic Determinism\n\nVarious HGP proponents told us that we would discover our human\nessence in the genome. According to Dulbecco (1986), \u201cthe\nsequence of the human DNA is the reality of our species\u201d (p.\n1056); Gilbert was quoted as saying \u201csequencing the human genome\nis like pursuing the holy grail\u201d (in Lee 1991, p. 9); on the\ntopic of his decision to dedicate three percent of HGP funds to ELSI,\nWatson wrote: \u201cThe Human Genome Project is much more than a vast\nroll call of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs: it is as precious a body of knowledge\nas humankind will ever acquire, with a potential to speak to our most\nbasic philosophical questions about human nature, for purposes of good\nand mischief alike\u201d (with Berry 2003, p. 172).\n\n\u201cGeneticization\u201d is a term used to describe the phenomenon\ncharacterized by an increasing tendency to reduce human differences to\ngenetic ones (Lippman 1991). The several billion dollars of funding\nfor the HGP was justified by the belief that genes are key\ndeterminants of not only rare Mendelian diseases like\nHuntington\u2019s disease or cystic fibrosis but common\nmulti-factorial conditions like cancer, depression, and heart disease.\nWrote an early critic of the HGP: \u201cWithout question, it was the\ntechnical prowess that molecular biology had achieved by the early\n1980s that made it possible even to imagine a task as formidable as\nthat of sequencing what has come to be called \u2018the human\ngenome.\u2019 But it was the concept of genetic disease that created\nthe climate in which such a project could appear both reasonable and\ndesirable\u201d (Keller 1992, p. 293). Given that the development of\nany trait involves the interaction of both genetic and nongenetic\nfactors, on what bases can genes be privileged as causes to claim that\na particular disease or nondisease trait is \u201cgenetic\u201d or\ncaused by a \u201cgenetic susceptibility\u201d or \u201cgenetic\npredisposition\u201d? This question has led philosophers of science\nto grapple with appropriate definitions for terms such as\n\u201cgenetic disease\u201d and \u201cgenetic susceptibility\u201d\nand how best to conceptualize genetic causation and\ngene\u2013environment interaction (e.g., Kitcher 1996; Gannett 1999;\nKronfeldner 2009). Closely related to the concepts of geneticization\nand genetic disease/ susceptibility/ predisposition are assumptions\nabout genetic reductionism and genetic determinism.\n\nGenetic reductionism can be understood as governing the\nwhole\u2013part relation in which organismal properties are explained\nsolely in terms of genes and organisms are identified with their\ngenomes. Definitions of health and disease attach to organisms and\ntheir physiological and developmental processes in particular contexts\n(provided by populations and environments) and cannot simply be\nrelocated to the level of the genome (Griesemer 1994; Limoges 1994;\nLloyd 1994), however, and diseases do not become more objectively\ndefined entities once they receive a genetic basis since social and\ncultural values implicated in designations of health and disease can\nbecome incorporated at the level of the genome, in what counts as a\nnormal or abnormal gene (Gannett 1998). In contrast to physical\nreductionism, which does not privilege DNA but considers it on par\nwith proteins, lipids, and other molecules (Sarkar 1998), genetic\nreductionism assumes that genes are in some sense more causally\nefficacious. Genetic determinism concerns such assumptions about the\ncausal efficacy of genes.\n\nIn a public lecture held to celebrate completion of the HGP, Collins\ncharacterized the project as \u201can amazing adventure into\nourselves, to understand our own DNA instruction book, the shared\ninheritance of all humankind\u201d (see National Human Genome\nResearch Institute, 2003). At the cellular level, the book is said to\ncontain \u201cthe genetic instructions for the entire repertoire of\ncellular components\u201d (Collins et al. 2003, p. 3). At this level,\ngenetic determinism is sustained by metaphors of Weismannism and DNA\nas \u201ccode\u201d or \u201cmaster molecule\u201d (Griesemer\n1994; Keller 1994), which accord DNA causal priority over other\ncellular components. This may be in a physical sense: Weismannism\nassumes (falsely) that intergenerational continuity exists only for\ngerm cell nuclei whereas somatic cells and germ cell cytoplasm arise\nanew in each generation. It may also be in the sense of a point of\norigin for the transfer of information: the central dogma of molecular\nbiology, which represents a 1950s reformulation of Weismannism in\nterms of information theory, asserts that information travels\nunidirectionally from nucleic acids to protein, and never vice versa.\nIt is contentious, however, whether amongst the cell\u2019s\ncomponents only nucleic acids can be said to transmit information: for\nsome philosophers, genetic coding plays a theoretical role at least at\nthis cellular level (Godfrey-Smith 2000); for others, genetic coding\nis merely (and misleadingly) metaphorical, and all cellular components\nare potential bearers of information (Griffiths 2001; Griffiths and\nGray 1994; Sarkar 1996).\n\nAt the organismal level, new research in functional genomics may lead\nto less deterministic accounts even of so-called single gene\ndisorders. For these, the concepts of penetrance and expressivity\noperate in ways that accommodate the one\u2013one genetic determinist\nmodel where the mutation is necessary and/or sufficient for both the\npresence of the condition and confounding patterns of phenotypic\nvariability. But the severity of even a fully penetrant condition like\nHuntington\u2019s disease seems to depend on not just genetic factors\nlike the number of DNA repeats in the mutation but epigenetic factors\nlike the sex of the parent who transmitted the mutation (Ridley et al.\n1991). For complex conditions to which both genetic and environmental\ndifferences contribute\u2014for example, psychiatric disorders or\nbehavioral differences\u2014genetic determinism is denied, and\neveryone is an interactionist these days, in some sense of\n\u201cinteraction.\u201d Both genes and environment are recognized\nto be necessary for development: by themselves, genes cannot determine\nor do anything. Yet, theorists still seem to give the nod to one or\nthe other, suggesting that it is mostly genes or mostly the\nenvironment, mostly nature or mostly nurture, that make us what we\nare. This implies that it is possible to apportion the relative\ncontributions of each. Gilbert (1992) suggests this in his dismissal\nof a more simplistic version of genetic determinism: \u201cWe must\nsee beyond a first reaction that we are the consequences of our genes;\nthat we are guilty of a crime because our genes made us do it; or that\nwe are noble because our genes made us so. This shallow genetic\ndeterminism is unwise and untrue. But society will have to wrestle\nwith the questions of how much of our makeup is dictated by the\nenvironment, how much is dictated by our genetics, and how much is\ndictated by our own will and determination\u201d (pp. 96\u201397).\nHowever, the assertion that the relative contributions of genes and\nenvironment can be apportioned in this way is misleading if not\noutright false. Building on R. C. Lewontin\u2019s (1974) classic\npaper on heritability, work in developmental systems theory (DST)\nundermines any such attempts to apportion causal responsibility in\norganismal development: traits are jointly determined by multiple\ncauses, each context-sensitive and contingent (Griffiths and Gray\n1994; Griffiths and Knight 1998; Oyama 1985; Oyama et al. 2001; Robert\n2004).\n\nGeneticization, genetic reductionism, and genetic determinism helped\nto sell the HGP. Gilbert (1992) endorsed the reduction of individual\nhumans to their genes: \u201cThe information carried on the DNA, that\ngenetic information passed down from our parents,\u201d he wrote,\n\u201cis the most fundamental property of the body\u201d (p. 83), so\nmuch so, in fact, that \u201cone will be able to pull a CD out of\none\u2019s pocket and say, \u2018Here is a human being; it\u2019s\nme!\u2019\u201d (p. 96). Cancers that we consider to be\nenvironmental in their origins were recast as genetically determined.\nIn Watson\u2019s words: \u201cSome call New Jersey the Cancer State\nbecause of all the chemical companies there, but in fact, the major\nfactor is probably your genetic constitution\u201d (in Cooper 1994,\np. 326). In Bodmer\u2019s words: \u201cCancer, scientists have\ndiscovered, is a genetic condition in which cells spread\nuncontrollably, and cigarette smoke contains chemicals which stimulate\nthose molecular changes\u201d (Bodmer and McKie 1994, p. 89). (See\nProctor 1992 and Plutynski 2018 for discussions of cancer as a genetic\ndisease.) Marking the 20th anniversary of the release of\nthe draft sequences, Richard Gibbs, director of the sequencing center\nat Baylor, admits that \u201cthere was plenty of hype that was shared\nwith the media and the wider community\u201d and that such\n\u201coutlandish visions\u201d as personalizing therapies, revealing\nthe \u201cmysteries of the architecture of common complex\ndiseases,\u201d and predicting criminality have not been realized.\nBut Gibbs excuses the hype as necessary for generating support for the\nproject: \u201cThe hyperbole that we look back on did not, however,\ncome from the front line. It came from those who championed the\nprogramme, mindful of its long-term benefits. Thanks to them, they\ngenerated the enthusiasm to fund this transformative work\u201d\n(2020, p. 575).\n\nLike Gibbs, bioethicist Timothy Caulfield (2018) finds the hype and\nhyperbole of scientists understandable: \u201cEnthusiasm and\noptimistic predictions of near-future applications are required in\norder to mobilize the scientific community and potential funders, both\npublic and private. This is particularly so in areas like genomics,\nwhere large amounts of sustained funding are required in order to\nachieve the hoped for scientific and translational goals\u201d (p.\n561). However, unlike Gibbs, Caulfield details possibilities of\n\u201creal harm,\u201d which include \u201cpotentially eroding\npublic trust and support for science; inappropriately skewing research\npriorities and the allocation of resources and funding; creating\nunrealistic expectations of benefit for patients; facilitating the\npremature uptake of expensive and potentially harmful emerging\ntechnologies by health systems; misinforming policy and ethics\ndebates; and accelerating the marketing and utilization of unproven\ntherapies\u201d (p. 567). The hype and hyperbole used to promote\npersonalized (or precision) medicine carry the risks Caulfield\nmentions.\n\nApproaching 20 years since completion of the HGP, genome science has\nnot revolutionized medicine or markedly improved human health.\nProgress has been made on rare diseases (e.g., spinal muscular\natrophy) and some forms of cancer (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer),\nthough these interventions can be prohibitively expensive (Tabery\n2023). For most complex diseases, however, predictions based on\n\u201cfamily history, neighborhood, socioeconomic circumstances, or\neven measurements made with nothing more than a tape measure and a\nbathroom scale\u201d outperform predictions based on the possession\nof genetic variants identified by GWAS. Pressing public health\nproblems such as increasing obesity, the opiate epidemic, and mental\nillness fail to be addressed by the \u201chuman genome-driven\nresearch agenda\u201d to which the lion\u2019s share of resources go\n(Joyner and Paneth 2019). So even though the deterministic and\nreductionistic assumptions underlying the HGP have been undermined by\nthe research in molecular biology the project made possible (Keller\n2000), the critics\u2019 worries about geneticization, genetic\nreductionism, and genetic determinism remain relevant, in particular\ntheir belief that embracing a reductionist approach to medicine that\nconceives of human health and disease in wholly molecular or genetic\nterms individualizes these and detracts attention from risks factors\nassociated with our shared social and physical environments (Nelkin\nand Tancredi 1989; Hubbard and Wald 1993; Tabery 2023).\n2.2 Genetic Testing, Genetic Discrimination, and Genetic Privacy\n\nGenetic testing is carried out for a range of purposes: diagnostic,\npredictive, and reproductive. Genetic testing carried out at the\npopulation level for any of these purposes is referred to as genetic\nscreening. Diagnostic genetic testing is performed on individuals\nalready experiencing signs and symptoms of disease as part of their\nclinical care. Newborn screening programs to diagnose conditions such\nas PKU and hemoglobinopathies based on blood components and\ncirculating metabolites (thus providing indirect genetic tests) have\nbeen carried out for many decades. Predictive genetic testing is\nperformed on individuals who are at risk for inheriting a familial\ncondition, such as cystic fibrosis or Huntingdon\u2019s disease, but\ndo not yet show any signs or symptoms. Reproductive genetic testing is\ncarried out through carrier screening, prenatal testing of the fetus\nin utero, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos\ncreated by in vitro fertilization (IVF). In carrier screening,\nprospective parents find out whether they are at risk for passing on\ndisease-related genes to their offspring. Prenatal genetic testing of\nfetuses in utero is conducted using blood tests early in a\nwoman\u2019s pregnancy, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at\n10\u201312 weeks, and amniocentesis at 15\u201318 weeks. Testing is\nincreasingly offered to all women who are pregnant, not just those for\nwhom risk is elevated because of age or family history; based on the\nresults, women can elect to continue the pregnancy or abort the fetus.\nIn PGD, a single cell is removed from the 8-cell embryo for testing;\nbased on the results, a decision is made about which embryo(s) to\nimplant in the woman\u2019s uterus.\n\nThere are significant ethical issues associated with genetic testing.\nThese issues are informed by empirical studies of the psychosocial\neffects of testing (Wade 2019). Increased knowledge that comes from\npredictive genetic testing is not an unmitigated good: denial may be a\ncoping mechanism; individuals may feel guilty for passing on harmful\nmutations to their offspring or stigmatized as having the potential to\ndo so; survivor guilt may arise in those who find out they are not at\nrisk for a disease such as Huntingdon\u2019s after all, or they may\nbecome at a loss about how to live their lives differently; those who\nfind out they are destined to develop Huntingdon\u2019s or\nearly-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease may become depressed or even\nsuicidal; paternity may not be what it is assumed to be; decisions\nabout disclosing results have implications for family members. During\ndebates about the HGP, many authors appealed to the history of\neugenics to warn about the dangers of reproductive genetic testing and\nurge caution as we move forward\u2014so much so that historian Diane\nPaul (1994) characterized eugenics as the\n\u201c\u2018approved\u2019 project anxiety\u201d (p. 143). Paul\nnoted that attempts to draw lessons from the history of eugenics are\nconfounded by disagreements about how to define\n\u201ceugenics\u201d\u2014whether to characterize eugenics\naccording to a program\u2019s intentions or effects, its use of\ncoercive rather than voluntary means, or its appeals to social and\npolitical aims that extend beyond the immediate concerns of individual\nfamilies. The label \u201cliberal eugenics\u201d has become\nincreasingly accepted for characterizing offspring selection based on\nparental choice. Reproductive rights are no longer just about the\nright not to have a child (to use contraception, to have an abortion)\nor the right to bear a child (to refuse population control measures).\nReproductive rights have come to encompass the right to access\ntechnological assistance to procreate and to have a certain kind of\nchild (Callahan 1998).\n\nConcerns about genetic discrimination resulting from genetic testing\nwere frequently expressed at the outset of the HGP. Concerns focused\nmostly on insurance companies and employers, but possibilities for\ngenetic discrimination occurring in other institutional settings were\nraised as well (Nelkin 1992; Nelkin and Tancredi 1989). A number of\ngeneral arguments have been made against institutional forms of\ngenetic discrimination: we don\u2019t choose our genes and ought not\nbe punished for what is outside our control (Gostin 1991); the social\ncosts of creating a \u201cbiologic\u201d or \u201cgenetic\nunderclass\u201d of people who lack health care and are unemployed or\nstuck in low-wage jobs are too great (Lee 1993; Nelkin and Tancredi\n1989); people\u2019s fears of genetic discrimination, whether\nrealistic or not, may lead them to forego genetic testing that might\nbenefit their lives and be less inclined to participate in genetic\nresearch (Kass 1997); people have the right not to know their genetic\nrisk status (Kass 1997). Genetic discrimination may also occur in less\nformal circumstances. Mate choice could increasingly proceed based on\ngenetic information, with certain people being labeled as undesirable.\nAs more and more fetuses are aborted on genetic grounds, families of\nchildren born with similar conditions, and people with disabilities\nand their advocates more broadly, worry that increased stigmatization\nwill result. In addition, group-based genetic research into diseases\nor behavioral differences risks stigmatizing people based on racial,\nethnic, and gender differences, with such risks informed by the\ntroubling history of the study of the genetics of intelligence (Tabery\n2015).\n\nIn the U.S., where unlike other industrialized countries there is no\npublicly funded system of universal health care, genetic\ndiscrimination by insurance companies and employers has been a\nparticularly serious worry; existing or prospective employees found to\nbe at genetic risk could be fired or not hired by employers to reduce\ncosts of providing health care coverage. ELSI research relating to\ngenetic privacy and the risk of genetic discrimination is credited\nwith bringing about changes in federal law with \u201cfar\nreaching\u201d effects on society (McEwen et al. 2014)\u2014in\nparticular, passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act\n(GINA) in May 2008, which prohibits U.S. health insurance companies\nand employers from discriminating based on genetic information,\ndefined to include genetic test results and family history but not\nmanifest disease. The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, by\nprohibiting discrimination by health insurers based on preexisting\nconditions, which include genetic test results and manifest disease,\nfills in that gap and negates the need for GINA in the context of\nhealth insurance. As for employment, there remains a gap: employees\nwho are substantially impaired are covered by the Americans with\nDisabilities Act and employees who are asymptomatic with genetic tests\nshowing a predisposition for disease are covered by GINA, but\nemployees with manifest disease who are not substantially impaired are\ncovered by neither (Green et al. 2015). GINA does not prohibit use of\ngenetic information in underwriting for life, disability, or mortgage\ninsurance. Discrimination takes the form of refusing coverage on the\nbasis that the genetic susceptibility counts as a \u201cpreexisting\ncondition,\u201d charging high premiums for the policy, limiting\nbenefits, or excluding certain conditions. In 2020, Florida became the\nfirst state to prohibit use of genetic test results by life insurance\ncompanies.\n\nThe insurance industry argues that there is no principled reason to\ntreat genetic information any differently from other medical\ninformation used in underwriting. They point to the problem of\n\u201cadverse selection\u201d: people who know themselves to be at\nhigh risk are more likely to seek insurance than people who know\nthemselves to be at low risk, which threatens the market when insurers\nare deprived of the same information (Meyer 2004; Pokorski 1994).\nTaking an approach to legislation and policy that singles out genetic\ninformation for protection has also been criticized philosophically\nfor being based on \u201cmisconceptions [that] include the\npresumption that a clear distinction exists between genetic and\nnongenetic information, tests, and diseases and the genetic\nessentialist belief that genetic information is more definitive, has\ngreater predictive value, and is a greater threat to our privacy than\nis nongenetic medical information\u201d (Beckwith and Alper 1998, p.\n208; see also Rothstein 2005). The approach has been dubbed\n\u201cgenetic exceptionalism\u201d and is criticized for drawing\nfrom, and in turn fostering, myths of genetic determinism and genetic\nreductionism (Murray 1997, p. 61; see also O\u2019Neill 2001). Rather\nthan assuming the binarism implicated in here\u2014that genetic\ninformation is unique and targeted policies are necessary or that\ngenetic information is not unique and targeted policies are\nunnecessary\u2014\u201cgenomic contextualism\u201d has been\nrecommended as alternative approach (Garrison et al. 2019a). This\napproach recognizes that there are both similarities and differences\nbetween genomic and other types of clinically relevant information and\nthat the specific context in which the policy or practice is\nimplemented determines how best to proceed. Since completion of the\nHGP, the contexts in which genomics is practiced have changed\nsufficiently that while privacy concerns remain pressing, the debate\nhas been largely recast.\n\nAt the outset of the HGP, concerns about genetic privacy focused on\nhow to protect the public from intrusive governments, employers, and\ninsurance companies. But the explosion of DTC genomics has raised\nprivacy concerns caused by the very public in need of protection! In\nDTC genomics, Y-chromosomal, mitochondrial, and autosomal DNA ancestry\ntests are used to provide familial matches. These matches enable\nadoptees in closed adoptions and offspring of anonymous gamete donors\nto track down biological parents and other family members, raising\nobvious privacy concerns for those who gave up children for adoption\nor agreed to donate or sell eggs or sperm expecting that their\nanonymity would be protected. Additional privacy concerns arise as the\nresult of genetic genealogy\u2019s use of matches to cousins of\nvarious degrees to fill out missing branches in family trees. Genome\nscientists rely on cell lines, DNA sequence data, and clinical data\nsets that have been di-identified to protect the anonymity of\nvolunteers; however, access to genetic genealogy databases that\ncombine genetic and traditional genealogical information makes\nre-identification possible. In genetic genealogy, surname projects\nbased on the co-inheritance of surnames and Y-chromosomal haplotypes\nfurnish candidate surnames when sequence information is available;\nusing Internet searches to match surnames with year of birth and U.S.\nstate of residence, researchers were able to identify individuals who\nhad participated in the 1000 Genomes Project; by extension, they also\nidentified family members who had not participated in the project or\nconsented to share information (Gymrek et al. 2013). Based on\npopulation genetic modelling, researchers suggest that with a genetic\ngenealogy database that covers two percent of a target population, a\nthird cousin match can be obtained for 99 percent of the population.\nWith this match, family trees constructed using traditional\ngenealogical methods and additional sources of information can be used\nto identify an unknown individual for whom DNA is available: this is\nthe \u201clong range familial search\u201d approach that law\nenforcement is using in an increasing number of active as well as cold\ncases (Erlich et al. 2018).\n\nA response to the inability to guarantee anonymity for participants in\ngenomic research is to consider concerns about genetic privacy and\nprivacy more generally to be pass\u00e9e. Such concerns are\nincreasingly seen to stand in the way of scientific progress. Watson\nand Venter have promoted the idea that there is nothing to fear by\nmaking one\u2019s sequence public rather than protecting it as\nprivate. Venter\u2019s diploid genome was fully sequenced and the\nfindings published in the October 2007 issue of PLoS Biology (Levy et\nal. 2007); this was followed by the publication of Watson\u2019s\n\u201ccomplete\u201d genome in the 17 April 2008 issue of Nature\n(Wheeler et al. 2008). Relevant to the privacy question, Watson did\nnot bare all: at Watson\u2019s request, the APOE gene which is linked\nto Alzheimer\u2019s disease was omitted from his sequence. Along\nsimilar lines, the volunteers Church recruits for the Personal Genome\nProject agree to release their genomes and health and physical\ninformation publicly, a model of \u201copen consent\u201d replacing\ngenetic privacy (Lunshof et al. 2008). Says Church: \u201cIdeally,\neverybody on the planet would share their medical and genomic\ninformation\u201d (in Dizikes 2007). Large-scale biobanking\ninitiatives such as the All of Us Research Program,\noriginally called the Precision Medicine Initiative or PMI, appeal to\ncollective altruism. The Internet has radically changed people\u2019s\nexpectations of privacy, the boundary between their personal and\npublic lives, and their expectations of accessing information, and\nthese changes are welcomed by genome scientists. To ensure \u201cthe\nfree flow of research data,\u201d the 2011 National Research Council\nreport calls for the \u201c[g]radual elimination of institutional,\ncultural, and regulatory barriers to widespread sharing of the\nmolecular profiles and health histories of individuals, while still\nprotecting patients\u2019 rights\u201d (p. 60).\n\nWith this free flow of research data, across institutions and\nglobally, with varying degrees of oversight, people\u2019s ability to\nconsent to use of their biospecimens and data for some but not other\npurposes becomes impossible (Zarate et al. 2016). Privacy concerns are\namplified insofar as genomics is a science driven by big data. The\npromise of personalized and precision medicine is premised, for some,\non amassing all obtainable data on individuals, whether mined from\nelectronic health records, government databases, DTC genomics,\ngenealogy sites, mobile devices, social media, credit card\ntransactions, fitbits, etc. Data-driven biology forgoes hypotheses for\nalgorithms, but these algorithms are not innocuous. Hallam Stevens\n(2021) describes \u201can emerging medical-industrial complex\u201d\nthat presents \u201csubstantial challenges for privacy, data\nownership, and algorithmic bias,\u201d which, if not addressed, will\nlead to a genomic science that operates in the interests of\n\u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d and the corporate tech giants\n(pp. 565\u2013566). Governments, especially authoritarian ones, are\nbuilding databases that supplement DNA with biometics and social media\nposts to carry out genomic surveillance that often targets minorities\n(Moreau 2019).\n\nOf course, significant social privilege attaches to some\npeople\u2019s ability not to worry that genetic testing offered as an\nemployee benefit (Singer 2018) or their virtual cloud of billions of\ndata points will cause them harm. Or that they will regret spitting\ninto a tube and sending it off to 23andMe. As Anna Jabloner (2019)\nargues, \u201cmolecular identification technologies \u2026 tell a\ntale of two molecular Californias: one is a tale of an unchanged\nbiological determinism that continues to mark some bodies as risky and\ncriminal, the other tale is of individual empowerment through the\nconsumption of molecular knowledge\u201d (p. 15). Black and Latino\nmen are overrepresented in CAL-DNA, which is one of the largest\ncriminological DNA databases in the world, while 23andMe\u2019s even\nlarger database contains the DNA of mostly wealthy white Americans.\nSimilarly, Reardon (2017) comments on the tension between the\ndemocratizing impulse of the open-data model of Church\u2019s\nPersonal Genome Project and the overwhelming Whiteness, affluence, and\nmaleness of the tech-savvy volunteers who have contributed their\ngenomes\n\nIndigenous groups resist this open consent model that appeals to\ncollective altruism and seek to maintain control over biospecimens\ncontributed and data generated. As participants in scientific studies,\nthey have experienced lack of support for their interests and\npriorities, failure to share benefits of research, disrespect for\ncultural and spiritual beliefs, theft of traditional knowledge,\nconduct of unapproved secondary research, and opportunistic\ncommercialization (Garrison et al. 2019b). Genetics and genomics bring\nspecific concerns, as \u201cgenomic data are commonly seen by Indigenous\ncommunities as more sensitive than other types of health data,\nparticularly with regard to genealogy and ancestry research that can\ninfluence traditionally held beliefs, cultural histories and identity\nclaims affecting rights to land and other resources \u201d (Hudson et al.\n2020, p. 378). Given distrust of funding agencies, universities, and\nresearchers arising from these experiences and concerns, Indigenous\nunderrepresentation in biobanks, DNA sequence databases, and clinical\ndatasets is not surprising. Genome scientists desire access to\nbiospecimens and data of Indigenous peoples for a range of purposes:\ngeographical isolation of populations over tens of thousands of years\ncan yield genetic variants of physiological and clinical interest\nassociated with adaptive responses to environments; comparative\ngenomics and ancient DNA studies contribute to knowledge of human\nevolutionary history; and efforts to identify genetic contributions to\ncomplex traits using GWAS and admixture mapping depend on access to\npopulations that incorporate the genetic diversity of the species. Any\nprogress in the prevention and treatment of disease that arises\nthrough precision medicine will be weighted towards populations most\nstudied. Indigenous peoples make up only 0.022% of participants in\nGWAS conducted worldwide (Mills and Rahal 2019).\n\nIn recognition of the overrepresentation of people of European descent\nin biobanks, DNA sequence databases, and clinical datasets, the\nNIH\u2019s All of Us initiative seeks to include at least 50\npercent underrepresented minorities, motivated by the goal that\nprecision medicine benefit everyone. Keolu Fox (2020) points out that\nNIH plans to include Indigenous communities in the All of Us\ninitiative fail to appreciate that the open-source data approach used\nfor previous government-funded, large-scale human genome sequencing\nefforts such as the International HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes\nProject facilitates the commodification of data by pharmaceutical and\nancestry-testing companies. Nanibaa\u2019 A. Garrison et al. (2019b)\nsuggest that development of alternative models for genetic and genomic\nresearch involving Indigenous peoples begin by recognizing Indigenous\nsovereignty, which is \u201cthe inherent right and capacity of Indigenous\npeoples to develop culturally, socially, and economically along lines\nconsistent with their respective histories and values\u201d (pp.\n496\u2013497). There should be tangible benefits for Indigenous communities\n(e.g., support for health promotion, meaningful results), with\nequitable sharing of profits should commercialization occur (Hudson et\nal. 2020). Community engagement is crucial; this may extend to\ncommunity-based participatory research that views Indigenous\ncommunities as partners in research, not merely subjects of research.\nIndividual consent is insufficient and should be preceded by\ncollective consent, and consent needs to be an ongoing process for any\nsubsequent research contemplated (Garrison et al. 2019b; Tsosie et al.\n2019). Indigenous control over the use and disposal of DNA samples is\nneeded: on the \u201cDNA on loan\u201d approach developed in Canada\n(Arbour and Cook 2006), the participant or community retains ownership\nof biological materials and entrusts these to researchers or research\ninstitutions as stewards. As for data gleaned from biological\nmaterials, the model of open consent is counter to the concept of\nIndigenous data sovereignty, which is \u201cthe inherent and\ninalienable rights and interests of indigenous peoples relating to the\ncollection, ownership and application of data about their people,\nlifeways and territories\u201d (Kukutai and Taylor 2016, p. 2).\n2.3 Identity and Difference: The \u201cNormal\u201d Human Genome\n\nEarly in the debates surrounding plans for the HGP, questions arose\nconcerning what it means to map and sequence the human\ngenome\u2014\u201cget the genome,\u201d as Watson (1992) put it.\nAbout these concerns, McKusick (1989) wrote: \u201cThe question often\nasked, especially by journalists, is \u2018Whose genome will be\nsequenced?\u2019 The answer is that it need not, and surely will not,\nbe the genome of any one person. Keeping track of the origin of the\nDNA that is studied will be important, but the DNA can come from\ndifferent persons chosen for study for particular parts of the\ngenome\u201d (p. 913). The HGP and Celera reference sequences are\nindeed composites based on chromosomal segments that originate from\ndifferent individuals: the sequence in any given region of the genome\nbelongs to a single individual, but sequences in different regions of\nthe genome belong to different individuals. However, in both cases,\nthe majority of the sequence originates from just one person. As HGP\nsequencing efforts accelerated, concerns arose that only four genomes,\na couple of which belonged to known laboratory personnel, were being\nused for physical mapping and sequencing (Marshall 1996a). The\ndecision was made to construct 10 new clone libraries for sequencing\nwith each library contributing about 10 percent of the total DNA. In\nthe end, 74.3 percent of the total number of bases sequenced was\nderived from a single clone library\u2014that of a male, presumably\nfrom the Buffalo area; seven other clone libraries contributed to an\nadditional 17.3 percent of the sequence (International Human Genome\nSequencing Consortium 2001, p. 866). A similar proportion\u2014close\nto 71 percent\u2014of the Celera sequence belongs to just one male\neven though five ethnically diverse donors were selected; incredibly\nenough, rumors were eventually confirmed that this individual is\nVenter himself (McKie 2002).\n\nThe deeper question, of course, is how we might understand a single\nhuman genome sequence, a composite that belongs to no actual\nindividual in its entirety and only a handful of individuals in its\nparts, to be representative of the entire species. This seems to\nignore the extensive genetic variability that exists. Early critics of\nthe HGP pointed out numerous faults with the concept of a\nrepresentative or putatively normal genome: many DNA polymorphisms are\nfunctionally equivalent (Sarkar and Tauber 1991); the genome sequence\nwill contain unknown defective genes (since no one, including donors,\nis free of these), and it is impossible to identify the genetic basis\nof a disorder simply by comparing the sequences of sick and well\npeople since there will be many differences between them (Lewontin\n2000 [1992]); and from an evolutionary viewpoint, mutations are not\n\u201cerrors\u201d in the genetic code or \u201cdamage\u201d to\nthe genome\u2019s structure, but the genetic variants that provide\nthe raw materials that make it possible for new species to arise\n(Limoges 1994, p. 124). There were related worries that the human\ngenome reference sequence would arbitrate a standard of genetic\nnormality; for example, the application of concepts like\n\u201cgenetic error\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d to the genome\ninstitutes a call for correction or repair (Limoges 1994; also Murphy\n1994). Indeed, the 1988 Office for Technology Assessment report on the\nHGP recommended the \u201ceugenic use of genetic information \u2026\nto ensure \u2026 that each individual has at least a modicum of\nnormal genes\u201d (p. 85).\n\nScience named \u201chuman genetic variation\u201d as\n\u201cBreakthrough of the Year\u201d for 2007. Humans have been\nfound to be 99.9 percent alike genetically, but notable for the\nmagazine was the extent to which individuals had been found to differ\ngenetically from one another\u2014in SNPs, insertions, deletions, and\nother structural elements\u2014and the promise this apparently\nunexpected amount of variation holds for using genome-wide association\nstudies (GWAS) to discover the genetic bases for complex traits, both\ndisease and non-disease traits, to which multiple genetic and\nnongenetic factors contribute. The human genome reference sequence has\nbeen useful as a tool for discovering and cataloguing that genetic\nvariation by providing a standard shared by the scientific community:\n\u201cThe current reference genome assembly works as the foundation\nfor all genomic data and databases. It provides a scaffold for genome\nassembly, variant calling, RNA or other sequencing read alignment,\ngene annotation, and functional analysis. Genes are referred to by\ntheir loci, with their base positions defined by reference genome\ncoordinates. Variants and alleles are labeled as such when compared to\nthe reference (i.e., reference (REF) versus alternative (ALT)).\nDiploid and personal genomes are assembled using the reference as a\nscaffold, and RNA-seq reads are typically mapped to the reference\ngenome\u201d (Ballouz et al. 2019, p. 159). However, what had\nportrayed as a journalist\u2019s or philosopher\u2019s question is\nnow being asked by genome scientists too. Even as a tool, there are\nchallenges to overcome. If alleles included in the reference sequence\nare relatively rare, \u201creference bias\u201d is introduced:\ngenomes that resemble the reference genome are easier to assemble and\nalign, and variants are missed or misidentified (Ballouz et al. 2019).\nAnd when entire stretches of sequence are missing in the reference\nsequence, those sequences will be discarded and missed entirely\nbecause of the reliance on the genome reference sequence for\nassembling and aligning sequenced genomes (Sherman and Salzberg\n2020).\n\nSince 2003, there have been ongoing efforts to update the human genome\nreference sequence by filling gaps, correcting errors, and replacing\nminor alleles (the current version of the reference sequence is\nGRCh38). Diversity has been incorporated in the reference sequence by\ntacking on additional sequences, but by maintaining a linear\nrepresentation, this loses location information (Kaye and Wasserman\n2021). Suggestions have been made for ways to further improve the\ngenome reference sequence. Recently developed long read sequencing\ntechnologies facilitate the discovery of large structural variants\n(SVs) and not just genetic variants (i.e., SNPs and smaller insertions\nand deletions, or \u201cindels\u201d). One suggestion calls for\n\u201creconstructing a more precise canonical human reference\ngenome\u201d by using those SVs to correct misassemblies in the\nreference sequence and adding the more common SVs to improve variant\ndetection (Yang et al. 2019). Another suggestion recommends adopting a\n\u201cconsensus sequence\u201d approach, in which the most common\nalleles and variants in the population are chosen for inclusion\n(Ballouz et al. 2019). Problems remain, however: these remain\ncomposite genomes and may contain sequences that would not be found\ntogether in any individual, and ongoing updates undermine the\nstability of the reference sequence as a reference (Kaye and Wasserman\n2021). Suggestions have also been made for the replacement of the\ngenome reference sequence. Long read sequencing allows the\n\u201cde novo assembly\u201d of genomes, which obviates\nneed of the reference sequence for scaffolding (Chiasson et al. 2015).\nA human \u201cpan-genome\u201d would accommodate variation by\nserving as a collection of all the DNA sequences found in the species,\nboth SVs and genetic variants, and replace a linear representation of\nthe genome with more complex genome graphs (Sherman and Salzberg 2020;\nMiga and Wang 2021). Another possibility is \u201cThe Genome\nAtlas,\u201d which foregoes use of the reference sequence even as a\ncoordinate system, with entries in the atlas instead features of the\ngenome assigned unique feature object identifiers (FOIs). The database\ngenerates blueprint genomes based on selected features for use in\nsequencing reads (Kaye and Wasserman 2021).\n\nPhilosophical concerns about whether a human genome reference sequence\narbitrates a standard of genetic normality remain, though these may be\nmitigated by the pan-genome and genome atlas approaches. An\nempirically validated consensus sequence approach that includes the\nmost common alleles and variants in the population in the genome\nreference sequence does not imply that those alleles and variants are\nof biomedical significance because they are conducive to health or of\nevolutionary significance because they are ancestral.\nScience\u2019s 18 February 2011 issue in celebration of the\n10-year anniversary of publication of the draft human genome sequence\ncontains an essay by genome scientist Maynard V. Olson, which asks, in\nits title, \u201cWhat Does a \u2018Normal\u2019 Human Genome Look\nLike?\u201d Although the HGP was criticized as anti-evolutionary,\npre-Darwinian, typological, and essentialist for seemingly instituting\na standard of genetic normality, it was also argued that the HGP might\nbe seen instead as incorporating a specific set of evolutionary\nassumptions (Gannett 2003). Indeed, from an evolutionary perspective,\nOlson contends that genetic variability among relatively healthy\nhumans is largely composed of deleterious mutations, rather than\nadaptive mutations due to balancing or diversifying selection, and\nthat, consequently, \u201cthere actually is a \u2018wild-type\u2019\nhuman genome\u2014one in which most genes exist in an evolutionarily\noptimized form\u201d (p. 872), though individual humans inevitably\n\u201cfall short of this Platonic ideal.\u201d Judgments about what\nconstitutes a \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cwild-type,\u201d or\n\u201cideal\u201d human genome do not escape the socio-cultural\ncontexts in which they arise. Social and cultural values that attach\nto judgements at the phenotypic level are simply embedded in the\ngenome, where they are less visible as such (Gannett 1998).\n\nIn promoting the HGP, Gilbert (1992) suggested that we will find\nanswers to the age-old question about human nature in our genome:\n\u201cAt the end of the genome project, we will want to be able to\nidentify all the genes that make up a human being\u2026. So by\ncomparing a human to a primate, we will be able to identify the genes\nthat encode the features of primates and distinguish them from other\nmammals. Then, by tweaking our computer programs, we will finally\nidentify the regions of DNA that differ between the primate and the\nhuman\u2014and understand those genes that make us uniquely\nhuman\u201d (p. 94). Although philosophers challenge the species\nessentialism that defines species in terms of genetic properties\nshared by all and only their members (Gannett 2003; Robert and Baylis\n2003), genome scientists are indeed comparing the human genome\nreference sequence to chimpanzee, bonobo, and Neandertal genome\nreference sequences to explore questions about human nature. Already\nin 1969, Sinsheimer foresaw the promise of molecular biology to remake\nhuman nature: \u201cFor the first time in all time, a living creature\nunderstands its origin and can undertake to design its future\u201d\n(in Kevles 1992, p. 18). Remaking human nature is likely to begin with\ngenetic modifications that convey the possibility of resistance to a\nserious disease, like HIV/AIDS, or minimize the effects of aging to\nextend lifespan, but transhumanists who view human nature as \u201ca\nwork-in-progress, a half-baked beginning that we can learn to remold\nin desirable ways\u201d welcome improvements in memory, intelligence,\nand emotional capacities as well (Bostrom 2003, p. 493). Theories of\njustice are typically based on conceptions of human nature; although\nthe new field of sociogenomics continues to favor nature over nurture\n(Bliss 2018), with the capacity to remake human nature, this\nfoundation disappears (Fukuyama 2002; Habermas 2003).\n2.4 Identity and Difference: Race, Ethnicity, and the Genome\n\nConcerns about race, ethnicity, and the genome were raised in the\nearly years of the HGP. Racial profiling in the legal system was one\nsuch concern: if people belonging to particular racial and ethnic\ngroups are more likely to be arrested, charged, or convicted of a\ncriminal offense, they are more likely to be required to provide DNA\nsamples to forensic databases, and therefore more likely to come back\ninto the system with future offenses (Kitcher 1996). Another concern\nwas that if genetic discrimination by insurers and employers creates a\n\u201cgenetic underclass\u201d (Lee 1993; Nelkin and Tancredi 1989),\nthen to the extent that race and ethnicity correlate with\nsocioeconomic status, some groups\u2014already affected by\ndisparities in health outcomes unrelated to genetic\ndifferences\u2014will be disproportionately represented among this\n\u201cgenetic underclass.\u201d A further concern was the social\nstakes involved when group-based differences are identified, whether\nthese involve sequences localized to particular groups or varying in\nfrequency among groups (Lapp\u00e9 1994). And given the history of\nusing biological explanations to provide ideological justification for\nsocial inequalities associated with oppressive power structures, the\nprospective use of molecular genetics to explain race differences was\nmet with caution (Hubbard 1994). These concerns were dismissed by HGP\nproponents, who argued that mapping and sequencing the human genome\ncelebrate our common humanity. At the June 26, 2000 White House press\nconference announcing completion of \u201ca working draft\u201d of\nthe sequence of the human genome, Venter announced that the results\nshow that \u201cthe concept of race has no genetic or scientific\nbasis\u201d (see Clinton, et al. 2000).\n\nPost-HGP genetics and genomics have not lived up to the mantra that\nbecause we are 99.9 percent the same, there is no such thing as race.\nIndeed, a predominantly African American racial identity has been\nascribed to the human genome reference sequence itself (Reich et al.\n2009), and the de novo assembly of genomes permitted by long\nread sequencing has led to several countries, such as China, Korea,\nand Denmark, producing their own \u201cethnicity-specific reference\ngenomes\u201d (Kowal and Llamas 2019). The International HapMap\nProject, which was initiated in 2002 with the goal of compiling a\nhaplotype map adequately dense with SNP markers to permit the\nidentification of genes implicated in common diseases and drug\nresponses, sampled the DNA of four populations (European-Americans in\nUtah; Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria; Japanese in Tokyo; and Han Chinese in\nBeijing). This reproduction of racial categories (here, European,\nAfrican, and Asian) at the level of the genome has been characterized\nas the \u201cmolecular reinscription of race\u201d (Duster 2015).\nDTC ancestry testing appeals to a range of group categories, which are\ndefined by geography, nationality, ethnicity, and race: Ancestry.com\nadvertises tests for Irish ancestry in early March each year;\nFamilyTreeDNA confirms Jewish ancestry, whether Ashkenazi or Sephardi;\nAfrican Ancestry, Inc. finds ancestral ties to present-day African\ncountries and ethnic groups dating back more than 500 years; and\nDNAPrint\u2019s panels of ancestry informative markers determine\nproportions of (Indo)European, East Asian, sub-Saharan African, and\nNative American heritage.\n\nThe resurgence in biological thinking about race and ethnicity since\nthe HGP is due in large part to the postgenomic use of racial and\nethnic categories of difference to try to capture patterns of group\ngenetic differences in various fields of research. The revolutionary\nbenefits of postgenomic \u201cpersonalized\u201d or\n\u201cprecision\u201d medicine were supposed to focus on individual\ngenetic differences within populations, not group genetic differences\nacross populations. Pharmaceuticals, a powerful engine driving\npost-HGP research into human genetic differences, were supposed to be\ntailored to individual genomes. In 2003, Venter opposed the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) proposal to carry out pharmaceutical\ntesting using the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) racial and\nethnic classification system, arguing that these are\n\u201csocial\u201d not \u201cscientific\u201d categories of race\nand ethnicity and that the promise of pharmacogenetics lies in its\nimplementation as individualized medicine given the likelihood that\nvariation in drug responses will vary more within racial and ethnic\ngroups than among them (Haga and Venter 2003). However, en route to a\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d or \u201cprecision\u201d medicine based\non individual genetic differences and pharmaceuticals tailored to\nindividual genomes, a detour via research into group genetic\ndifferences has been taken. Now that group genetic differences have\nbecome of interest to more than just evolutionary biologists and\npopulation geneticists, impetus is provided to debates to which\nphilosophers of science have contributed: longstanding debates about\nwhether race is biologically real or socially constructed (Andreasen\n2000; Pigliucci and Kaplan 2003; Gannett 2010; Hochman 2013; Spencer\n2014) and more recent ones concerning the appropriateness of the use\nof racial categories in biomedical research (Root 2003; Gannett 2005;\nKaplan 2010; Hardimon 2013).\n\nDespite the detour via group genetic differences en route to\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d or \u201cprecision\u201d medicine,\ngenome-based research into common diseases and drug responses has\nfocused predominantly on Europeans. For GWAS, a 2009 analysis showed\nthat 96 percent of participants were of European descent; by 2016,\nthough the proportion of participants of European descent had\ndecreased to 81 percent, the change was mostly accounted for by a\ngreater number of studies being carried out in Asian countries\n(Popejoy and Fullerton 2016). Even though African populations are the\nmost genetically diverse in the world, by 2018, only 2 percent of GWAS\nparticipants had been African in origin (Sirugo et al. 2019). This\nEuropean bias makes it more difficult to isolate rare genetic variants\ncontributing to disease, to provide accurate and informative genetic\ntest results to nonEuropeans, and to ensure that any clinical benefits\nthat arise from genomic research will be equitably distributed within\nthe U.S. and globally. Sociologist Dorothy E. Roberts (2021) calls for\ngenetic researchers to \u201cstop using a white, European standard\nfor human genetics and instead study a fuller range of human genetic\nvariation,\u201d which will \u201cgive scientists a richer resource\nto understand human biology\u201d as well as promoting equitable\naccess to the benefits of research. That study of human genetic\nvariation, Roberts argues, should abandon use of race \u201cas a\nbiological variable that can explain differences in health, disease,\nor responses to therapies,\u201d as it obscures \u201chow structural\nracism has biological effects and produces health disparities in\nracialized populations\u201d (p. 566). Structural racism is advanced\nas a key determinant of population health: for example, the racial and\neconomic segregation of neighborhoods contributes to health\ndisparities because of differences in quality of housing, exposure to\npollutants and toxins, good education and employment opportunities,\nand access to decent health care (Bailey et al. 2017).\n\nThe NHGRI has affirmed its commitment to improve the inclusion of\nparticipants from diverse populations in research and begun to\nappreciate that genomic studies are designed in ways that fail to\nconsider the contribution of social and physical environments to\ndisease (Hindorff et al. 2018). However, as sociologist Steven Epstein\n(2007) has argued more generally, the \u201cinclusion-and-difference\nparadigm\u201d that has prevailed in U.S. research over the past\ncouple of decades, though correcting researchers\u2019 previously\nheld default assumption of the white, middle-aged, white male as the\nnormative standard, serves to amplify the role of biology in health\nand disease while drawing attention away from society. Genome\nscientists understand the ramifications attached to their use of\nracial and ethnic categories in research, and despite longstanding,\nwell-considered ELSI-funded research that urges care be attached to\nthe use of these categories (Sankar and Cho 2002; Sankar et al. 2007),\nproblems are ongoing and attended to by NHGRI leaders concerned about\n\u201cthe misuse of social categories of race and ethnicity as a\nproxy for genomic variation\u201d (Bonham et al. 2018, p. 1534). The\n\u201cweaponization\u201d of genomics by White nationalists and the\nalt-right has raised the stakes for genome scientists. The\nself-described fascist, White supremacist, racist, and anti-Semite who\nmurdered 10 African Americans at a Buffalo supermarket in 2022 posted\nwritings that cited dozens of scientific studies, including use of a\nGWAS of educational attainment to support hereditarian views of racial\ndifferences in intelligence and use of a principal components analysis\n(PCA) that resolved human genetic diversity into continental-level\nclusters to support realism about biological race (Carlson 2022).\n\nWhite supremacists chug milk to celebrate their origins in European\npopulations that evolved the ability to digest lactose in adulthood\n(Harmon 2018), and they appeal to traces of Neanderthal DNA in their\ngenomes to celebrate their origins in populations that evolved outside\nAfrica (Wolinsky 2019). While it seems incumbent on genome scientists\nto confront racist misuses of their research, they face challenges in\ndoing so. Misuse may result from misunderstanding science, but not\nalways: lay experts among White nationalists capably use cutting-edge\ngenomics research to justify hereditarian views, thereby building a\ncounter-knowledge (Doron, in press) or citizen science of sorts\n(Panofsky and Donovan 2019). In the U.S., White nationalists take DTC\nancestry tests to prove their genetic purity, that they are 100%\nEuropean/White/non-Jewish (Panofsky and Donovan 2019), while in\nEurope, this assumed homogeneity of Whiteness comes into question with\nNordicists and Mediterraneans using genetic admixture mapping as they\nvie to prove themselves the most European of Europeans (Doron, in\npress). When scientists engage with racists, even ones who are\nscientifically literate, there is the risk of unintentionally helping\ntheir cause. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d as Aaron Panofsky et al.\n(2021) argue, \u201cmany of the findings about human evolution and\nvariation are genuinely complex, ambiguous, contested, changing, and\ninvolve historically contingent judgments\u201d (p. 396); hence, it\nmay be difficult to claim that research has been misconstrued. As\nClaude-Olivier Doron notes, insofar as lay experts exploit ambiguities\nconstitutive of scientific discourse in population genetics as they\ntransfer scientific findings to a White supremacist ideological\nframework, these findings operate within the framework without\ndistortion.\n\nGenome scientists have made recommendations about sampling protocols\nand standards for visualizations in population genomics to discourage\nthe misappropriation of research by racists who draw conclusions\ninconsistent with the intentions of scientists (Carlson et al. 2022).\nHowever, these recommendations portray population genetic structure,\nunlike race, as wholly biological, and as science studies scholarship\nsuggests, the challenge of accessing the biological without recourse\nto the social\u2014and the interests, biases, and imaginaries\nassociated with the social\u2014may be impossible to overcome.\nHistorians, sociologists, and anthropologists of science have\ninsightfully documented how social, political, and cultural\nconstructions of identity are incorporated in, and become defined by,\ngenetics and genomics research in ways specific to their locations:\nreenactment of continentally-defined races as biogeographical ancestry\nin the U.S. (Fullwiley 2008; Gannett 2014); influence of population\ngenetics on Irish origin stories and genealogy of the Irish Travellers\n(Nash 2008; Nash 2017); naturalization and even pathologization of\ncaste and regional differences in India (Egorova 2010);\ngeneticization/genomicization of Mestizo identity in the context of\nMexico\u2019s own genome mapping project (L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n\n2011); post-apartheid South Africa\u2019s \u201cgenomic\narchive\u201d bound to apartheid\u2019s racialized subjectivities\ndespite advancing nonracial unity through common origins (Schramm\n2021); genetic ancestry testing as a basis for Jewishness (El-Haj\n2012); Native American DNA as proof of tribal identity (TallBear\n2013); and nationalism\u2019s role in interpreting differences\nbetween the Korean Reference Genome (KOREF) and HGP\u2019s genome\nreference sequence as occurring at the population rather than\nindividual level (Kowal and Llamas 2019).\n\nUse of \u201cancestry\u201d as a category for genetics and genomics\nresearch is considered a means of averting problems associated with\nthe use of \u201crace\u201d and \u201cethnicity\u201d; for\nexample, for the mapping of complex traits, rather than relying on\nself-identified race, it has been recommended that population\nstructure be assessed empirically by genotyping individuals to\ndetermine their \u201ccontinental ancestry\u201d proportions\n(Shields et al. 2005). Critics contend, however, that\n\u201ccontinental ancestry\u201d belies the continuous pattern with\nwhich genetic variation is distributed across the species and reenacts\nrace as it has been traditionally defined, thus contributing to its\nreification (Fullwiley 2008; Gannett 2014; Lewis et al. 2022). In\n2023, the National Academy of Sciences published a Consensus Study\nReport, \u201cUsing Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics\nResearch: A New Framework for an Evolving Field,\u201d in response to\na request by the National Institutes of Health to assess the status of\nuse of race, ethnicity, ancestry, and other population descriptors.\nThe report recommends against use of racial labels in genetics and\ngenomics research, a possible exception being studies of health\ndisparities with genomic data, in which race serves as a proxy for\nenvironmental variables (e.g., racism). A distinction is drawn between\ngenetic ancestry (paths through which an individual\u2019s DNA is\ninherited from specific ancestors, known as the \u201cancestral\nrecombination graph\u201d) and genetic similarity (a quantitative\nmeasure of genetic resemblance among individuals that reflects shared\ngenetic ancestry). The report recognizes geographic origins,\nethnicity, and genetic ancestry as appropriate categories for\nreconstructing human evolutionary history, but advocates use of\ngenetic similarity to constitute groups in most other research\ncontexts, including gene discovery for complex traits.\n\nRelying on genetic similarity does not necessarily lead researchers\naway from race, ethnicity, and ancestry. In an ethnographic study,\nsociologists Joan H. Fujimura and Ramya Rajagopalan (2011) found that\nalthough the statistical machinery associated with GWAS allows\nresearchers to avoid race and ethnic categories by analyzing samples\nbased wholly on genetic similarity, there was \u201cslippage\u201d\nfrom genetic similarity to shared ancestry, which, in turn, since\nmediated by geography and genealogy, became interpreted as racial or\nethnic. While ancestral recombination graphs situate individuals in\nthe context of their genealogical relations without assigning them to\ngeographically or culturally defined populations or groups, in\npractice, these categories are almost always incorporated in genetic\nancestry estimation (Lewis et al. 2022). Population geneticist Graham\nCoop (2022) favours replacing genetic ancestry with genetic\nsimilarity, arguing that describing a sampled individual\u2019s\ngenetic similarity to a reference panel (e.g., \u201cX is\ngenetically similar to the GBR 1000 Genome samples\u201d) is\npreferable to attributing genetic ancestry to that individual (e.g.,\n\u201cX has Northwestern European genetic ancestry\u201d),\nas it recognizes the conventionalism of the reference panel and\ncontinuity of genetic variation (pp. 11\u201312). However, given that the\n1000 Genomes Project\u2019s 26 populations across five continental\nregions are named using language that reflects \u201cboth the\nancestral geography or ethnicity of each population and the geographic\nlocation where the samples from that population were collected\u201d\n(Coriell Institute)\u2014e.g., \u201cBritish from England and\nScotland\u201d\u2014the slippage remarked upon by Fujimura and\nRajagopalan is encouraged. Nevertheless, as sociologists Aaron\nPanofsky and Catherine Bliss (2017) observe, \u201cGeneticists face a\ncomplex set of pressures regarding population labeling\u201d (p. 75).\nAmbiguous labels for populations that conflate geography, race, and\nethnicity may offer geneticists the flexibility to fulfill their own\nresearch goals while accessing repositories of preclassified\nbiospecimens and data, collaborating with researchers pursuing quite\ndifferent agendas, and maintaining goodwill with populations studied.\nThese pressures compete with pressures about labels imposed by funders\nand journals, which may provoke skepticism and resistance.\n2.5 ELSI and Its Legacy\n\nAlthough ELSI may have had an inauspicious argued beginning in\nWatson\u2019s apparent off-the-cuff remarks at a 1988 news\nconference, the research program has outlasted the HGP itself. ELSI\nfunding is mandated through the National Institutes of Health\nRevitalization Act of 1993, which calls for a minimum of 5 percent of\nthe NIH budget for the HGP\u2014the monies directed to the\nNCHGR-NHGRI\u2014to be set aside to study the ethical, legal, and\nsocial implications of the science of genomics (McEwen et al. 2014).\nThe Division of Genomics and Society at the NIH\u2019s NHGRI, created\nin 2012, maintains the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI)\nResearch Program as an extramural grant funding initiative to the\npresent day; the division also includes an intramural bioethics\nprogram. Input concerning the ELSI program is provided by the NHGRI\nGenomics and Society Working Group through the National Advisory\nCouncil for Human Genome Research.\n\nA review article by NIH staff (McEwen et al. 2014) characterizes the\nELSI program as \u201can ongoing experiment.\u201d Since it was\nestablished in 1990, the ELSI program has supported empirical and\nconceptual research carried out by researchers from a broad range of\ndisciplines: \u201cgenetics and genomics, clinical medicine,\nbioethics, the social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology,\nanthropology, political science, and communication science), history,\nphilosophy, literature, law, economics, health services, and public\npolicy\u201d (p. 485). This research is considered to have had\nimpacts on genomics studies (e.g., requirements for informed consent,\nprotection of the privacy of subjects, and nomenclature for socially\ndefined groups), genomic medicine (e.g., personal impacts of acquiring\ngenetic information from screening and testing carried out in\nclinical, research, and direct-to-consumer settings), and wider\nsociety (e.g., federal legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination\nin health insurance and employment, increased awareness about DNA\nforensics, and policies on gene patenting). The experimental aspect\nremarked upon refers to the organizational and physical situation of\nELSI, a program charged with critically evaluating the implications\ngenomics research, within the very agency that funds that research.\nWhile this institutional arrangement supports the growing trend to\nintegrate ELSI research with genomics research and policy formulation,\nensuring that ELSI research is scientifically informed and practically\nrelevant, excessive proximity also risks compromising \u201cthe\nautonomy, objectivity, and intellectual independence of ELSI\ninvestigators\u201d (McEwen et al. 2014).\n\nSince the early years of the HGP, bioethicists have criticized ELSI on\nvarious institutional grounds: for a lack of independence from\nscientist-overseers (Murray 1992; Yesley 2008), for an absence of\nstructure conducive to providing guidance regarding policy (Hanna\n1995), and for a negative impact on bioethics in narrowing the range\nof topics covered and creating an isolated subspecialty within the\nfield (Annas and Elias 1992; Hanna et al. 1993). And from history and\nphilosophy of science quarters, broader philosophical concerns have\nbeen raised about ELSI\u2019s focus on the ethical, legal, and social\nimplications of genetic research. Such a focus promotes a\n\u201cdownstream\u201d rather than \u201cupstream\u201d framework\nfor understanding the relationship between science and ethics that\nfails to appreciate that foundational concepts in genetic research\nsuch as normality and mutation are themselves evaluative and operate\nas directives to action (Limoges 1994). ELSI\u2019s European\ncounterpart, Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects or ELSA, chose to use\nthe term \u201caspects\u201d in order to avoid the connotations of\nnarrowness, linearity, and determinism attached to the term\n\u201cimplications\u201d (Hilgartner et al. 2016).\n\nThe \u201congoing experiment\u201d at the NIH\u2019s NHGRI has come\nto define a particular model for doing research in bioethics that is\nbeing exported to other rapidly developing scientific fields, as\nexpressed in the title of a target article published in AJOB\nNeuroscience, \u201cTo ELSI or Not to ELSI Neuroscience: Lessons\nfor Neuroethics from the Human Genome Project\u201d (Klein 2010).\nIndeed, although \u201cELSI\u201d entered the lexicon as an acronym\nfor the specific extramural research program supported by US\ngovernment funding set aside for the HGP (elsewhere in the world,\nsimilar programs received their own appellations and\nacronyms\u2014e.g., Genomics and its Ethical, Environmental,\nEconomic, Legal, and Social Aspects or GE3LS in Canada),\nwith that program offering a possible model for other emerging\nsciences, the term has come to receive a broader meaning that refers\ninstead to a field of research, defined by its \u201cresearch and\nscholarship content, rather than a particular set of funding\nsources\u201d (Morrissey and Walker 2012, p. 52). Given the interest\nin exporting the ELSI model, its merits as a field of research, as\nbioethicists Clair Morrissey and Rebecca L. Walker argue (Morrissey\nand Walker 2012; Walker and Morrissey 2014), need to be examined.\nInvestigating the content and methods of ELSI as a field of research,\nMorrissey and Walker combed through hundreds of articles and book\nchapters published between 2003 and 2008 (Morrissey and Walker 2012,\nWalker and Morrissey 2014). They found that funding sources influenced\nwhat research is carried out: though only 17 percent of all\npublications involved empirical research, for publications whose\nauthors received US government funding, 30 percent of those with\nnon-NHGRI support and 52 percent of those with NHGRI support were\nempirically based. They found that institutional and professional\nforces, irrespective of funding sources, promoted the coverage of\ntopics of greatest interest to affluent populations (e.g.,\n\u201cgenomics and clinical practice,\u201d \u201cintellectual\nproperty,\u201d \u201cgenetic enhancement,\u201d and\n\u201cbiorepositories\u201d). They found that the vast majority (89\npercent) of publications were prescriptive, recommending to diverse\nactors (scientists, clinicians, bioethicists, government, etc.) that\ncertain policies or practices be pursued. Given this overwhelmingly\nprescriptive posture, they were dismayed to find that publications\nmade use of multiple bioethical methods in piecemeal fashion with\nlittle depth. For the most part (77 percent), publications did not\nreflect on methods.\n\nELSI itself has become an object of research in science and technology\nstudies (STS) scholarship. The ELSI model, as incorporated more\nrecently in areas such as nano and synthetic biology, is understood as\nserving as \u201ca new governance tool built on the prior\ninstitutionalization of \u2018bioethics\u2019 as a way to manage\nproblems of moral ambiguity and disagreement in biomedicine\u201d\n(Hilgartner et al. 2016, p. 824). At the outset of the HGP, ELSI\nrelied on a governance model in which ethicists and social scientists\nlent their expertise by producing a body of scholarship that could\ninform public policy; subsequently, especially in Europe, social\nscientists were expected to facilitate mechanisms for making public\npolicy in more democratic ways by engaging stakeholders and the\nbroader public. Hilgartner et al. (2016) argue that STS scholarship\nsits somewhat uneasily alongside ELSI scholarship inasmuch as STS\nscholarship problematizes elements of the \u201ctraditional\nimaginaries of orderly science-society relations\u201d to which ELSI\nsubscribes, such as the fact/value distinction, the\n\u201cneutrality\u201d of science and technology, and \u201cthe\nself-evidence of power relations\u201d (p. 832). Criticisms are also\nmade that as a tool of governance, bioethics exercises power in ways\noften unseen, thereby foreclosing questions asked and debates\nhad\u2014for e.g., taking the boundary between facts and values as\ngiven not made, presenting rational moral arguments as outside\npolitics to dismiss issues of public concern, or circumventing\nlegislation by justifying the extension of existing regulations.\n",
