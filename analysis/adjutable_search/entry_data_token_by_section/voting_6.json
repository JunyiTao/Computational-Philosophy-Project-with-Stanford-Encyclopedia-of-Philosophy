Moral Obligations Regarding How One Votes\n\nMost people appear to believe that there is a duty to cast a vote\n(perhaps including a blank ballot) rather than abstain (Mackie 2010:\n8\u20139), but this leaves open whether they believe there is a duty\nto vote in any particular way. Some philosophers and political\ntheorists have argued there are ethical obligations attached to how\none chooses to vote. For instance, many deliberative democrats (see\nChristiano 2006) believe not only that every citizen has a duty to\nvote, but also that they must vote in publicly-spirited ways, after\nengaging in various forms of democratic deliberation. In contrast,\nsome (G. Brennan and Lomasky 1993; J. Brennan 2009, 2011a)\nargue that while there is no general duty to vote (abstention is\npermissible), those citizens who do choose to vote have duties\naffecting how they vote. They argue that while it is not wrong to\nabstain, it is wrong to vote badly, in some theory-specified\nsense of \u201cbadly\u201d.\n\nNote that the question of how one ought to vote is distinct from the\nquestion of whether one ought to have the right to vote. The right to\nvote licenses a citizen to cast a vote. It requires the state to\npermit the citizen to vote and then requires the state to count that\nvote. This leaves open whether some ways a voter could vote could be\nmorally wrong, or whether other ways of voting might be morally\nobligatory. In parallel, my right of free association arguably\nincludes the right to join the Ku Klux Klan, while my right of free\nspeech arguably includes the right to advocate an unjust war. Still,\nit would be morally wrong for me to do either of these things, though\ndoing so is within my rights. Thus, just as someone can, without\ncontradiction, say, \u201cYou have the right to have racist\nattitudes, but you should not,\u201d so a person can, without\ncontradiction, say, \u201cYou have the right to vote for that\ncandidate, but you should not.\u201d\n\nA theory of voting ethics might include answers to any of the\nfollowing questions:\n\n The Intended Beneficiary of the Vote: Whose interests\nshould the voter take into account when casting a vote? May the voter\nvote selfishly, or should she vote sociotropically? If the latter, on\nbehalf of which group ought she vote: her demographic group(s), her\nlocal jurisdiction, the nation, or the entire world? Is it permissible\nto vote when one has no stake in the election, or is otherwise\nindifferent to the outcome?\n The Substance of the Vote: Are there particular\ncandidates or policies that the voter is obligated to support, or not\nto support? For instance, is a voter obligated to vote for whatever\nwould best produce the most just outcomes, according to the correct\ntheory of justice? Must the voter vote for candidates with good\ncharacter? May the voter vote strategically, or must she vote in\naccordance with her sincere preferences?\n Epistemic Duties Regarding Voting: Are voters required\nto have a particular degree of knowledge, or exhibit a particular kind\nof epistemic rationality, in forming their voting preferences? Is it\npermissible to vote in ignorance, on the basis of beliefs about social\nscientific matters that are formed without sufficient evidence?\n\n",
