    "main_text": "Ontology: What Are Models? || Physical objects\n2.1 Physical objects\n\nSome models are physical objects. Such models are commonly referred to\nas \u201cmaterial models\u201d. Standard examples of models of this\nkind are scale models of objects like bridges and ships (see\n Section 1),\n Watson and Crick\u2019s metal model of DNA (Schaffner 1969),\nPhillips and Newlyn\u2019s hydraulic model of an economy (Morgan and\nBoumans 2004), the US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 model of the San\nFrancisco Bay (Weisberg 2013), Kendrew\u2019s plasticine model of\nmyoglobin (Frigg and Nguyen 2016), and model organisms in the life\nsciences (Leonelli and Ankeny 2012; Leonelli 2010; Levy and Currie\n2015). All these are material objects that serve as models. Material\nmodels do not give rise to ontological difficulties over and above the\nwell-known problems in connection with objects that metaphysicians\ndeal with, for instance concerning the nature of properties, the\nidentity of objects, parts and wholes, and so on.\n\nHowever, many models are not material models. The Bohr model\nof the atom, a frictionless pendulum, or an isolated population, for\ninstance, are in the scientist\u2019s mind rather than in the\nlaboratory and they do not have to be physically realized and\nexperimented upon to serve as models. These \u201cnon-physical\u201d\nmodels raise serious ontological questions, and how they are best\nanalyzed is debated controversially. In the remainder of this section\nwe review some of the suggestions that have attracted attention in the\nrecent literature on models.\n",
