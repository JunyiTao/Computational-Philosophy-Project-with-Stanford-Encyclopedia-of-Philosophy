    "main_text": "The Later Philosophy || The Turn and the Contributions to Philosophy\n3.1 The Turn and the Contributions to Philosophy\n\n\nAfter Being and Time there is a shift in Heidegger's\nthinking that he himself christened \u2018the turn\u2019 (die\nKehre). In a 1947 piece, in which Heidegger distances his views\nfrom Sartre's existentialism, he links the turn to his own\nfailure to produce the missing divisions of Being and\nTime. \n\n\nThe adequate execution and completion of this other thinking that\nabandons subjectivity is surely made more difficult by the fact that in\nthe publication of Being and Time the third division of the\nfirst part, \u201cTime and Being,\u201d was held back\u2026 Here\neverything is reversed. The division in question was held back because\neverything failed in the adequate saying of this turning and did not\nsucceed with the help of the language of metaphysics\u2026 This\nturning is not a change of standpoint from Being and Time, but\nin it the thinking that was sought first arrives at the location of\nthat dimension out of which Being and Time is experienced,\nthat is to say, experienced from the fundamental experience of the\noblivion of Being. (Letter on Humanism, pp.\u00a0231\u20132)\n\n\n\nNotice that while, in the turning, \u201ceverything is\nreversed\u201d, nevertheless it is \u201cnot a change of standpoint\nfrom Being and Time\u201d, so what we should expect from the\nlater philosophy is a pattern of significant discontinuities with\nBeing and Time, interpretable from within a basic project and\na set of concerns familiar from that earlier text. The quotation from\nthe Letter on Humanism provides some clues about what to look\nfor. Clearly we need to understand what is meant by the abandonment of\nsubjectivity, what kind of barrier is erected by the language of\nmetaphysics, and what is involved in the oblivion of Being. The second\nand third of these issues will be clarified later. The first bears\nimmediate comment.\n\n\nAt root Heidegger's later philosophy shares the deep concerns\nof Being and Time, in that it is driven by the same\npreoccupation with Being and our relationship with it that propelled\nthe earlier work. In a fundamental sense, then, the question of Being\nremains the question. However, Being and Time\naddresses the question of Being via an investigation of Dasein, the\nkind of being whose Being is an issue for it. As we have seen, this\ninvestigation takes the form of a transcendental hermeneutic\nphenomenology that begins with ordinary human experience. It is\narguable that, in at least one important sense, it is this\nphilosophical methodology that the later Heidegger is rejecting when he\ntalks of his abandonment of subjectivity. Of course, as conceptualized\nin Being and Time, Dasein is not a Cartesian subject, so the\nabandonment of subjectivity is not as simple as a shift of attention\naway from Dasein and towards some other route to Being. Nevertheless\nthe later Heidegger does seem to think that his earlier focus on Dasein\nbears the stain of a subjectivity that ultimately blocks the path to an\nunderstanding of Being. This is not to say that the later thinking\nturns away altogether from the project of transcendental hermeneutic\nphenomenology. The project of illuminating the a priori conditions on\nthe basis of which entities show up as intelligible to us is still at\nthe heart of things. What the later thinking involves is a\nreorientation of the basic project so that, as we shall see, the point\nof departure is no longer a detailed description of ordinary human\nexperience. (For an analysis of \u2018the turn\u2019 that identifies\na number of different senses of the term at work in Heidegger's\nthinking, and which in some ways departs from the brief treatment given\nhere, see Sheehan 2010.)\n\n\n\nA further difficulty in getting to grips with Heidegger's\nlater philosophy is that, unlike the early thought, which is heavily\ncentred on a single text, the later thought is distributed over a large\nnumber and range of works, including books, lecture courses, occasional\naddresses, and presentations given to non-academic audiences. So one\nneeds a navigational strategy. The strategy adopted here will be to\nview the later philosophy through the lens of Heidegger's strange\nand perplexing study from the 1930s called Contributions to\nPhilosophy (From Enowning), (Beitrage zur Philosophie (Vom\nEreignis)), henceforth referred to as the Contributions.\n(For a book-length introduction to the Contributions, see\nVallega-Neu 2003. For a useful collection of papers, see Scott et al.\n2001.) The key themes that shape the later philosophy will be\nidentified in the Contributions, but those themes will be\nexplored in a way that draws on, and make connections with, a selection\nof other works. From this partial expedition, the general pattern of\nHeidegger's post-turn thinking, although not every aspect of it,\nwill emerge.\n\n\nThe Contributions was written between 1936 and 1938.\nIntriguingly, Heidegger asked for the work not to appear in print until\nafter the publication of all his lecture courses, and although his\ndemand wasn't quite heeded by the editors of his collected works,\nthe Contributions was not published in German until 1989 and\nnot in English until 1999. To court a perhaps overly dramatic telling\nof Heideggerian history, if one puts a lot of weight on\nHeidegger's view of when the Contributions should have\nbeen published, one might conceivably think of those later writings\nthat, in terms of when they were produced, followed the\nContributions as something like the training material needed\nto understand the earlier work (see e.g., Polt 1999 140). In any case,\nduring his lifetime, Heidegger showed the Contributions to no\nmore than a few close colleagues. The excitement with which the\neventual publication of the text was greeted by Heidegger's\nreaders was partly down to the fact that one of the chosen few granted\na sneak preview was the influential interpreter of Heidegger, Otto\nP\u00f6ggeler, who then proceeded to give it some rather extraordinary\nadvance publicity, describing it as the work in which Heidegger's\ngenuine and complete thinking is captured (see e.g., P\u00f6ggeler\n1963/1987).\n\n\nWhether or not the hype surrounding the Contributions was\njustified remains a debated question among Heidegger scholars (see e.g.,\nSheehan 2001, Thomson 2003). What is clear, however, is that reading\nthe work is occasionally a bewildering experience. Rather than a series\nof systematic hermeneutic spirals in the manner of Being and\nTime, the Contributions is organised as something like a\nmusical fugue, that is, as a suite of overlapping developments of a\nsingle main theme (Schoenbohm 2001; Thomson 2003). And while the\nstructure of the Contributions is challenging enough, the\nlanguage in which it is written can appear to be wilfully obscurantist.\nPolt (1999, 140) comments that \u201cthe most important sections of\nthe text can appear to be written in pure Heideggerese\u2026 [as\nHeidegger] exploits the sounds and senses of German in order to create\nan idiosyncratic symphony of meanings\u201d. Less charitably, Sheehan\n(2001) describes it as \u201ca needlessly difficult text, obsessively\nrepetitious, badly in need of an editor\u201d, while Schurmann (1992,\n313, quoted by Thomson 2003, 57) complains that \u201cat times one may\nthink one is reading a piece of Heideggerian plagiarism, so encumbered\nis it with ellipses and assertoric monoliths\u201d. Arguably, the\nstyle in which the Contributions is written is\n\u2018merely\u2019 the most extreme example (perhaps, the purest\nexample) of a \u2018poetic\u2019 style that Heidegger adopts pretty\nmuch throughout the later philosophy. This stylistic aspect of the turn\nis an issue discussed below. For the moment, however, it is worth\nnoting that, in the stylistic transition achieved in the\nContributions, Heidegger's writing finally leaves\nbehind all vestiges of the idea that Being can be represented\naccurately using some pseudo-scientific philosophical language.\nThe goal, instead, is to respond appropriately to Being\nin language, to forge a pathway to another kind of thinking\u2014Being-historical thinking (for discussion of this\nterm, see Vallega 2001, von Herrmann 2001, Vallega-Neu 2003, 28-9). In\nits attempt to achieve this, the Contributions may be viewed\nas setting the agenda for Heidegger's post-turn thought. So what\nare the central themes that appear in the Contributions and\nwhich then resonate throughout the later works? Four stand out: Being\nas appropriation (an idea which, as we shall see, is bound up with a\nreinterpretation of the notion of dwelling that, in terms of explicit\ntextual development, takes place largely outwith the text of the\nContributions itself); technology (or machination);\nsafeguarding (or sheltering); and the gods. Each of these themes will\nnow be explored.\n",
