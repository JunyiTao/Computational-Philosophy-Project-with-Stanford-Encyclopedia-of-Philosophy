    "main_text": "The Case Against Physicalism || Qualia and Consciousness\n5.1 Qualia and Consciousness\n\nThe main argument against physicalism is usually thought to concern\nthe notion of qualia, the felt qualities of experience. The notion of\nqualia raises puzzles of its own, puzzles having to do with its\nconnection to other notions such as consciousness, introspection,\nepistemic access, acquaintance, the first-person perspective and so\non. However the idea that we will discuss here is the apparent\ncontradiction between the existence of qualia and physicalism.\n\nPerhaps the clearest version of this argument is Jackson\u2019s\nknowledge argument; see\n qualia: the knowledge argument.\n This argument asks us to imagine Mary, a famous neuroscientist\nconfined to a black and white room. Mary is forced to learn about the\nworld via black and white television and computers. However, despite\nthese hardships Mary learns (and therefore knows) all that physical\ntheory can teach her. Now, if physicalism were true, it is plausible\nto suppose that Mary knows everything about the world. And yet \u2014\nand here is Jackson\u2019s point \u2014 it seems she does not know\neverything. For, upon being released into the world of color, it will\nbecome obvious that, inside her room, she did not know what it is like\nfor both herself and others to see colors \u2014 that is, she did not\nknow about the qualia instantiated by particular experiences of seeing\ncolors. Following Jackson (1986), we may summarize the argument as\nfollows:\n\n\nP1. Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to\nknow about other people. \n\nP2. Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to\nknow about other people (because she learns something about them on\nbeing released).\n\nConclusion. There are truths about other people (and herself) that\nescape the physicalist story.\n\n\nClearly this conclusion entails that physicalism is false: for if\nthere are truths which escape the physicalist story how can everything\nsupervene on the physical? So a physicalist must either reject a\npremise or show that the premises don\u2019t entail the\nconclusion.\n\nThere are many possible responses to this argument, but here I will\nbriefly mention only three. The first is the ability\nhypothesis due to Lawrence Nemerow (1988) and developed and\ndefended by David Lewis (1994). The ability hypothesis follows Ryle\n(1949) in drawing a sharp distinction between propositional knowledge\nor knowledge-that (such as \u2018Mary knows that snow is\nwhite\u2019) and knowledge-how (such as \u2018Mary knows how to ride\na bike\u2019), and then suggests that all Mary gains is the latter.\nOn the other hand, P2 would only be true if Mary gained propositional\nknowledge.\n\nA second response appeals to the distinction between a priori\nand a posteriori physicalism. As we saw above, the crucial\nclaim of a posteriori physicalism is that (13) \u2014 i.e.\nthe claim that S entails S* \u2014 is a\nposteriori. Since (13) is a posteriori, you would need\ncertain experience to know it. But, it is argued, Mary has not had\n(and cannot have) the relevant experience. Hence she does not know\n(13). On the other hand, the mere fact that Mary has not had (and\ncannot have) the experience to know (13) does not remove the\npossibility that (13) is true. Hence a posteriori physicalism\ncan avoid the knowledge argument. (It is an interesting question which\npremise of the knowledge argument is being attacked by this response.\nThe answer depends on whether (13) is physical or not: if (13) is\nphysical, then the response attacks P1. But if (13) is not physical,\nthe response is that the argument is invalid.).\n\nA third response is to distinguish between various conceptions of the\nphysical. We saw above that potentially the class of properties\ndefined by the theory-conception of the physical was distinct from the\nclass of properties defined by the object-conception. But that\nsuggests that the first premise of the argument is open to\ninterpretation in either of two ways. On the other hand,\nJackson\u2019s thought experiment only seems to support the premise\nif it is interpreted in the one way, since Mary learns by learning all\nthat physical theory can teach her. But leaves open the\npossibility that one might appeal to the object-conception of the\nphysical to define a version of physicalism which evades the knowledge\nargument.\n\nOne of the most lively areas of philosophy of mind concerns the issue\nof which if any of these responses to the knowledge argument will be\nsuccessful. (See the papers in Ludlow, Nagasawa, and Stoljar 2004. See\nalso\n Qualia: The Knowledge Argument)\n The ability response raises questions about whether know-how is\ngenuinely non-propositional (cf. Lycan 1996, Loar 1997 and Stanley and\nWilliamson 2001), and about whether it gets the facts right to begin\nwith (Braddon Mitchell and Jackson 1996). As against a\nposteriori physicalism, it has been argued both that it rests on\na mistaken approach to the necessary a posteriori (Chalmers\n1996, 1999, Jackson 1998), and that the promise of the idea is\nchimerical anyway (cf. Stoljar 2000). The third response raises\nquestions about the distinction between the object and the theory\nconception of the physical and associated issues about dispositional\nand categorical properties, and also about the relation between\nphysicalism on the one hand, and a related view, sometimes called\nRussellian monism. See\n Russellian monism,\n as well as Chalmers 1996, Lockwood 1992, Stoljar 2000, 2001, Montero\n2010, 2015) \n",
