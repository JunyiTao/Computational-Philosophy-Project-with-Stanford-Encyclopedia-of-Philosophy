    "main_text": "Why does Hegel use dialectics?\n3. Why does Hegel use dialectics?\n\nWe can begin to see why Hegel was motivated to use a dialectical\nmethod by examining the project he set for himself, particularly in\nrelation to the work of David Hume and Immanuel Kant (see entries on\n Hume\n and\n Kant).\n Hume had argued against what we can think of as the na\u00efve view\nof how we come to have scientific knowledge. According to the\nna\u00efve view, we gain knowledge of the world by using our senses to\npull the world into our heads, so to speak. Although we may have to\nuse careful observations and do experiments, our knowledge of the\nworld is basically a mirror or copy of what the world is like. Hume\nargued, however, that na\u00efve science\u2019s claim that our\nknowledge corresponds to or copies what the world is like does not\nwork. Take the scientific concept of cause, for instance. According to\nthat concept of cause, to say that one event causes another is to say\nthat there is a necessary connection between the first event (the\ncause) and the second event (the effect), such that, when the first\nevent happens, the second event must also happen. According to\nna\u00efve science, when we claim (or know) that some event\ncauses some other event, our claim mirrors or copies what the\nworld is like. It follows that the necessary, causal connection\nbetween the two events must itself be out there in the world. However,\nHume argued, we never observe any such necessary causal connection in\nour experience of the world, nor can we infer that one exists based on\nour reasoning (see Hume\u2019s A Treatise of Human Nature,\nBook I, Part III, Section II; Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, Section VII, Part I). There is nothing in the\nworld itself that our idea of cause mirrors or copies.\n\nKant thought Hume\u2019s argument led to an unacceptable, skeptical\nconclusion, and he rejected Hume\u2019s own solution to the\nskepticism (see Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, B5,\nB19\u201320). Hume suggested that our idea of causal necessity is\ngrounded merely in custom or habit, since it is generated by our own\nimaginations after repeated observations of one sort of event\nfollowing another sort of event (see Hume\u2019s A Treatise of\nHuman Nature, Book I, Section VI; Hegel also rejected\nHume\u2019s solution, see EL \u00a739). For Kant, science and\nknowledge should be grounded in reason, and he proposed a solution\nthat aimed to reestablish the connection between reason and knowledge\nthat was broken by Hume\u2019s skeptical argument. Kant\u2019s\nsolution involved proposing a Copernican revolution in philosophy\n(Critique of Pure Reason, Bxvi). Nicholas Copernicus was the\nPolish astronomer who said that the earth revolves around the sun,\nrather than the other way around. Kant proposed a similar solution to\nHume\u2019s skepticism. Na\u00efve science assumes that our knowledge\nrevolves around what the world is like, but, Hume\u2019s criticism\nargued, this view entails that we cannot then have knowledge of\nscientific causes through reason. We can reestablish a connection\nbetween reason and knowledge, however, Kant suggested, if we\nsay\u2014not that knowledge revolves around what the world is\nlike\u2014but that knowledge revolves around what we are\nlike. For the purposes of our knowledge, Kant said, we do not\nrevolve around the world\u2014the world revolves around us. Because\nwe are rational creatures, we share a cognitive structure with one\nanother that regularizes our experiences of the world. This\nintersubjectively shared structure of rationality\u2014and not the\nworld itself\u2014grounds our knowledge.\n\nHowever, Kant\u2019s solution to Hume\u2019s skepticism led to a\nskeptical conclusion of its own that Hegel rejected. While the\nintersubjectively shared structure of our reason might allow us to\nhave knowledge of the world from our perspective, so to speak, we\ncannot get outside of our mental, rational structures to see what the\nworld might be like in itself. As Kant had to admit, according to his\ntheory, there is still a world in itself or\n\u201cThing-in-itself\u201d (Ding an sich) about which we\ncan know nothing (see, e.g., Critique of Pure Reason,\nBxxv\u2013xxvi). Hegel rejected Kant\u2019s skeptical conclusion\nthat we can know nothing about the world- or Thing-in-itself, and he\nintended his own philosophy to be a response to this view (see, e.g.,\nEL \u00a744 and the Remark to \u00a744).\n\nHow did Hegel respond to Kant\u2019s skepticism\u2014especially\nsince Hegel accepted Kant\u2019s Copernican revolution, or\nKant\u2019s claim that we have knowledge of the world because of what\nwe are like, because of our reason? How, for Hegel, can we get out of\nour heads to see the world as it is in itself? Hegel\u2019s answer is\nvery close to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle\u2019s response\nto Plato. Plato argued that we have knowledge of the world only\nthrough the Forms. The Forms are perfectly universal, rational\nconcepts or ideas. Because the world is imperfect, however, Plato\nexiled the Forms to their own realm. Although things in the world get\ntheir definitions by participating in the Forms, those things are, at\nbest, imperfect copies of the universal Forms (see, e.g.,\nParmenides 131\u2013135a). The Forms are therefore not in\nthis world, but in a separate realm of their own. Aristotle argued,\nhowever, that the world is knowable not because things in the world\nare imperfect copies of the Forms, but because the Forms are in things\nthemselves as the defining essences of those things (see, e.g., De\nAnima [On the Soul], Book I, Chapter 1\n[403a26\u2013403b18]; Metaphysics, Book VII, Chapter 6\n[1031b6\u20131032a5] and Chapter 8 [1033b20\u20131034a8]).\n\nIn a similar way, Hegel\u2019s answer to Kant is that we can get out\nof our heads to see what the world is like in itself\u2014and hence\ncan have knowledge of the world in itself\u2014because the very same\nrationality or reason that is in our heads is in the world\nitself. As Hegel apparently put it in a lecture, the opposition\nor antithesis between the subjective and objective disappears by\nsaying, as the Ancients did, \n\n\nthat nous governs the world, or by our own saying that there\nis reason in the world, by which we mean that reason is the soul of\nthe world, inhabits it, and is immanent in it, as it own, innermost\nnature, its universal. (EL-GSH Addition 1 to \u00a724) \n\n\nHegel used an example familiar from Aristotle\u2019s work to\nillustrate this view: \n\n\n\u201cto be an animal\u201d, the kind considered as the universal,\npertains to the determinate animal and constitutes its determinate\nessentiality. If we were to deprive a dog of its animality we could\nnot say what it is. (EL-GSH Addition 1 to \u00a724; cf. SL-dG\n16\u201317, SL-M 36-37)\n\n\nKant\u2019s mistake, then, was that he regarded reason or rationality\nas only in our heads, Hegel suggests (EL \u00a7\u00a743\u201344),\nrather than in both us and the world itself (see also below in this\nsection and\n section 4).\n We can use our reason to have knowledge of the world because the very\nsame reason that is in us, is in the world itself as it own defining\nprinciple. The rationality or reason in the world makes reality\nunderstandable, and that is why we can have knowledge of, or can\nunderstand, reality with our rationality. Dialectics\u2014which is\nHegel\u2019s account of reason\u2014characterizes not only logic,\nbut also \u201ceverything true in general\u201d (EL Remark to\n\u00a779).\n\nBut why does Hegel come to define reason in terms of dialectics, and\nhence adopt a dialectical method? We can begin to see what drove Hegel\nto adopt a dialectical method by returning once again to Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy. Plato argued that we can have knowledge of the world only\nby grasping the Forms, which are perfectly universal, rational\nconcepts or ideas. Because things in the world are so imperfect,\nhowever, Plato concluded that the Forms are not in this world, but in\na realm of their own. After all, if a human being were perfectly\nbeautiful, for instance, then he or she would never become\nnot-beautiful. But human beings change, get old, and die, and so can\nbe, at best, imperfect copies of the Form of beauty\u2014though they\nget whatever beauty they have by participating in that Form. Moreover,\nfor Plato, things in the world are such imperfect copies that we\ncannot gain knowledge of the Forms by studying things in the world,\nbut only through reason, that is, only by using our rationality to\naccess the separate realm of the Forms (as Plato argued in the\nwell-known parable of the cave; Republic, Book 7,\n514\u2013516b).\n\nNotice, however, that Plato\u2019s conclusion that the Forms cannot\nbe in this world and so must be exiled to a separate realm rests on\ntwo claims. First, it rests on the claim that the world is an\nimperfect and messy place\u2014a claim that is hard to deny. But it\nalso rests on the assumption that the Forms\u2014the universal,\nrational concepts or ideas of reason itself\u2014are static and\nfixed, and so cannot grasp the messiness within the imperfect world.\nHegel is able to link reason back to our messy world by changing the\ndefinition of reason. Instead of saying that reason consists of static\nuniversals, concepts or ideas, Hegel says that the universal concepts\nor forms are themselves messy. Against Plato, Hegel\u2019s\ndialectical method allows him to argue that universal concepts can\n\u201covergrasp\u201d (from the German verb\n\u00fcbergreifen) the messy, dialectical nature of the world\nbecause they, themselves, are dialectical. Moreover, because\nlater concepts build on or sublate (cancel, but also preserve) earlier\nconcepts, the later, more universal concepts grasp the dialectical\nprocesses of earlier concepts. As a result, higher-level concepts can\ngrasp not only the dialectical nature of earlier concepts or forms,\nbut also the dialectical processes that make the world itself a messy\nplace. The highest definition of the concept of beauty, for instance,\nwould not take beauty to be fixed and static, but would include within\nit the dialectical nature or finiteness of beauty, the idea that\nbeauty becomes, on its own account, not-beauty. This dialectical\nunderstanding of the concept of beauty can then overgrasp the\ndialectical and finite nature of beauty in the world, and hence the\ntruth that, in the world, beautiful things themselves become\nnot-beautiful, or might be beautiful in one respect and not another.\nSimilarly, the highest determination of the concept of\n\u201ctree\u201d will include within its definition the dialectical\nprocess of development and change from seed to sapling to tree. As\nHegel says, dialectics is \u201cthe principle of all natural and\nspiritual life\u201d (SL-M 56; SL-dG 35), or \u201cthe moving soul\nof scientific progression\u201d (EL \u00a781). Dialectics is what\ndrives the development of both reason as well as of things in the\nworld. A dialectical reason can overgrasp a dialectical world.\n\nTwo further journeys into the history of philosophy will help to show\nwhy Hegel chose dialectics as his method of argument. As we saw, Hegel\nargues against Kant\u2019s skepticism by suggesting that reason is\nnot only in our heads, but in the world itself. To show that reason is\nin the world itself, however, Hegel has to show that reason can be\nwhat it is without us human beings to help it. He has to show that\nreason can develop on its own, and does not need us to do the\ndeveloping for it (at least for those things in the world that are not\nhuman-created). As we saw (cf.\n section 1),\n central to Hegel\u2019s dialectics is the idea that concepts or\nforms develop on their own because they \u201cself-sublate\u201d, or\nsublate (cancel and preserve) themselves, and so pass into\nsubsequent concepts or forms on their own accounts, because of their\nown, dialectical natures. Thus reason, as it were, drives itself, and\nhence does not need our heads to develop it. Hegel needs an account of\nself-driving reason to get beyond Kant\u2019s skepticism.\n\nIronically, Hegel derives the basic outlines of his account of\nself-driving reason from Kant. Kant divided human rationality into two\nfaculties: the faculty of the understanding and the faculty of reason.\nThe understanding uses concepts to organize and regularize our\nexperiences of the world. Reason\u2019s job is to coordinate the\nconcepts and categories of the understanding by developing a\ncompletely unified, conceptual system, and it does this work, Kant\nthought, on its own, independently of how those concepts might apply\nto the world. Reason coordinates the concepts of the understanding by\nfollowing out necessary chains of syllogisms to produce concepts that\nachieve higher and higher levels of conceptual unity. Indeed, this\nprocess will lead reason to produce its own transcendental ideas, or\nconcepts that go beyond the world of experience. Kant calls this\nnecessary, concept-creating reason \u201cspeculative\u201d reason\n(cf. Critique of Pure Reason, Bxx\u2013xxi, A327/B384).\nReason creates its own concepts or ideas\u2014it\n\u201cspeculates\u201d\u2014by generating new and increasingly\ncomprehensive concepts of its own, independently of the understanding.\nIn the end, Kant thought, reason will follow out such chains of\nsyllogisms until it develops completely comprehensive or unconditioned\nuniversals\u2014universals that contain all of the conditions or all\nof the less-comprehensive concepts that help to define them. As we saw\n(cf.\n section 1),\n Hegel\u2019s dialectics adopts Kant\u2019s notion of a self-driving\nand concept-creating \u201cspeculative\u201d reason, as well as\nKant\u2019s idea that reason aims toward unconditioned universality\nor absolute concepts.\n\nUltimately, Kant thought, reasons\u2019 necessary, self-driving\nactivity will lead it to produce contradictions\u2014what he called\nthe \u201cantinomies\u201d, which consist of a thesis and\nantithesis. Once reason has generated the unconditioned concept of the\nwhole world, for instance, Kant argued, it can look at the world in\ntwo, contradictory ways. In the first antinomy, reason can see the\nworld (1) as the whole totality or as the unconditioned, or (2) as the\nseries of syllogisms that led up to that totality. If reason sees the\nworld as the unconditioned or as a complete whole that is not\nconditioned by anything else, then it will see the world as having a\nbeginning and end in terms of space and time, and so will conclude\n(the thesis) that the world has a beginning and end or limit. But if\nreason sees the world as the series, in which each member of the\nseries is conditioned by the previous member, then the world will\nappear to be without a beginning and infinite, and reason will\nconclude (the antithesis) that the world does not have a limit in\nterms of space and time (cf. Critique of Pure Reason,\nA417\u201318/B445\u20136). Reason thus leads to a contradiction: it\nholds both that the world has a limit and that it does not have a\nlimit at the same time. Because reason\u2019s own process of\nself-development will lead it to develop contradictions or to be\ndialectical in this way, Kant thought that reason must be kept in\ncheck by the understanding. Any conclusions that reason draws that do\nnot fall within the purview of the understanding cannot be applied to\nthe world of experience, Kant said, and so cannot be considered\ngenuine knowledge (Critique of Pure Reason, A506/B534).\n\nHegel adopts Kant\u2019s dialectical conception of reason, but he\nliberates reason for knowledge from the tyranny of the understanding.\nKant was right that reason speculatively generates concepts on its\nown, and that this speculative process is driven by necessity and\nleads to concepts of increasing universality or comprehensiveness.\nKant was even right to suggest\u2014as he had shown in the discussion\nof the antinomies\u2014that reason is dialectical, or necessarily\nproduces contradictions on its own. Again, Kant\u2019s mistake was\nthat he fell short of saying that these contradictions are in the\nworld itself. He failed to apply the insights of his discussion of the\nantinomies to \u201cthings in themselves\u201d (SL-M 56;\nSL-dG 35; see also\n section 4).\n Indeed, Kant\u2019s own argument proves that the dialectical nature\nof reason can be applied to things themselves. The fact that reason\ndevelops those contradictions on its own, without our heads to\nhelp it, shows that those contradictions are not just in our\nheads, but are objective, or in the world itself. Kant, however,\nfailed to draw this conclusion, and continued to regard reason\u2019s\nconclusions as illusions. Still, Kant\u2019s philosophy vindicated\nthe general idea that the contradictions he took to be illusions are\nboth objective\u2014or out there in the world\u2014and necessary. As\nHegel puts it, Kant vindicates the general idea of \u201cthe\nobjectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the\ncontradiction which belongs to the nature of thought\ndeterminations\u201d (SL-M 56; cf. SL-dG 35), or to the nature of\nconcepts themselves.\n\nThe work of Johann Gottlieb Fichte (see entry on\n Fichte)\n showed Hegel how dialectics can get beyond Kant\u2014beyond the\ncontradictions that, as Kant had shown, reason (necessarily) develops\non its own, beyond the reductio ad absurdum argument (which,\nas we saw above, holds that a contradiction leads to nothingness), and\nbeyond Kant\u2019s skepticism, or Kant\u2019s claim that\nreason\u2019s contradictions must be reined in by the understanding\nand cannot count as knowledge. Fichte argued that the task of\ndiscovering the foundation of all human knowledge leads to a\ncontradiction or opposition between the self and the not-self (it is\nnot important, for our purposes, why Fichte held this view). The kind\nof reasoning that leads to this contradiction, Fichte said, is the\nanalytical or antithetical method of reasoning, which involves drawing\nout an opposition between elements (in this case, the self and\nnot-self) that are being compared to, or equated with, one another.\nWhile the traditional reductio ad absurdum argument would\nlead us to reject both sides of the contradiction and start from\nscratch, Fichte argued that the contradiction or opposition between\nthe self and not-self can be resolved. In particular, the\ncontradiction is resolved by positing a third concept\u2014the\nconcept of divisibility\u2014which unites the two sides (The\nScience of Knowledge, I: 110\u201311; Fichte 1982:\n108\u2013110). The concept of divisibility is produced by a synthetic\nprocedure of reasoning, which involves \u201cdiscovering in opposites\nthe respect in which they are alike\u201d (The Science\nof Knowledge, I: 112\u201313; Fichte 1982: 111). Indeed, Fichte\nargued, not only is the move to resolve contradictions with synthetic\nconcepts or judgments possible, it is necessary. As he says\nof the move from the contradiction between self and not-self to the\nsynthetic concept of divisibility, \n\n\nthere can be no further question as to the possibility of this\n[synthesis], nor can any ground for it be given; it is absolutely\npossible, and we are entitled to it without further grounds of any\nkind. (The Science of Knowledge, I: 114; Fichte 1982: 112)\n\n\n\nSince the analytical method leads to oppositions or contradictions, he\nargued, if we use only analytic judgments, \u201cwe not only do not\nget very far, as Kant says; we do not get anywhere at\nall\u201d (The Science of Knowledge, I: 113; Fichte 1982:\n112). Without the synthetic concepts or judgments, we are left, as the\nclassic reductio ad absurdum argument suggests, with nothing\nat all. The synthetic concepts or judgments are thus necessary to get\nbeyond contradiction without leaving us with nothing.\n\nFichte\u2019s account of the synthetic method provides Hegel with the\nkey to moving beyond Kant. Fichte suggested that a synthetic concept\nthat unifies the results of a dialectically-generated contradiction\ndoes not completely cancel the contradictory sides, but only limits\nthem. As he said, in general, \u201c[t]o limit something is\nto abolish its reality, not wholly, but in part\nonly\u201d (The Science of Knowledge, I: 108; Fichte 1982:\n108). Instead of concluding, as a reductio ad absurdum\nrequires, that the two sides of a contradiction must be dismissed\naltogether, the synthetic concept or judgment retroactively justifies\nthe opposing sides by demonstrating their limit, by showing which part\nof reality they attach to and which they do not (The Science of\nKnowledge, I: 108\u201310; Fichte 1982: 108\u20139), or by\ndetermining in what respect and to what degree they are each true. For\nHegel, as we saw (cf.\n section 1),\n later concepts and forms sublate\u2014both cancel and\npreserve\u2014earlier concepts and forms in the sense that\nthey include earlier concepts and forms in their own definitions. From\nthe point of view of the later concepts or forms, the earlier ones\nstill have some validity, that is, they have a limited validity or\ntruth defined by the higher-level concept or form.\n\nDialectically generated contradictions are therefore not a defect to\nbe reigned in by the understanding, as Kant had said, but invitations\nfor reason to \u201cspeculate\u201d, that is, for reason to generate\nprecisely the sort of increasingly comprehensive and universal\nconcepts and forms that Kant had said reason aims to develop.\nUltimately, Hegel thought, as we saw (cf.\n section 1),\n the dialectical process leads to a completely unconditioned concept\nor form for each subject matter\u2014the Absolute Idea (logic),\nAbsolute Spirit (phenomenology), Absolute Idea of right and law\n(Philosophy of Right), and so on\u2014which, taken together,\nform the \u201ccircle of circles\u201d (EL \u00a715) that\nconstitutes the whole philosophical system or \u201cIdea\u201d (EL\n\u00a715) that both overgrasps the world and makes it\nunderstandable (for us). \n\nNote that, while Hegel was clearly influenced by Fichte\u2019s work,\nhe never adopted Fichte\u2019s triadic\n\u201cthesis\u2014antithesis\u2014synthesis\u201d language in his\ndescriptions of his own philosophy (Mueller 1958: 411\u20132; Solomon\n1983: 23), though he did apparently use it in his lectures to describe\nKant\u2019s philosophy (LHP III: 477). Indeed, Hegel criticized\nformalistic uses of the method of \u201ctriplicity\n[Triplizit\u00e4t]\u201d (PhG-P \u00a750) inspired by Kant\u2014a\ncriticism that could well have been aimed at Fichte. Hegel argued that\nKantian-inspired uses of triadic form had been reduced to \u201ca\nlifeless schema\u201d and \u201can actual semblance\n[eigentlichen Scheinen]\u201d (PhG \u00a750; alternative\ntranslation) that, like a formula in mathematics, was simply imposed\non top of subject matters. Instead, a properly scientific use of\nKant\u2019s \u201ctriplicity\u201d should flow\u2014as he said his\nown dialectical method did (see\n section 1)\u2014out\n of \u201cthe inner life and self-movement\u201d (PhG \u00a751) of\nthe content. \n",
