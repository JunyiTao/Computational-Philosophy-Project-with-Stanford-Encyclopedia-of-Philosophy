    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn 1926, the Austrian philosopher Ernst Mally (1879-1944) proposed the\nfirst formal system of deontic logic. In the book in which he\npresented this system, The Basic Laws of Ought: Elements of the\nLogic of Willing, Mally gave the following motivation for his\nenterprise:\n\nIn 1919, everybody was using the word self-determination. I wanted to\nobtain a clear understanding of this word. But then, of course, I\nimmediately stumbled on the difficulties and obscurities surrounding\nthe concept of Ought, and the problem changed. The concept of Ought is\nthe basic concept of the whole of ethics. It can only serve as a\nusable foundation for ethics when it is captured in a system of\naxioms. In the following I will present such an axiomatic\n system.[1]\n\n\nAs Mally\u2019s words indicate, he was not primarily interested in deontic\nlogic for its own sake: he mainly wanted to lay the foundation of\n\u201can exact system of pure ethics\u201d (eine exakte reine\nEthik). More than half of his book is devoted to the development\nof this exact system of ethics. In the following, we will, however,\nconcentrate on the formal part of his book, both because it is its\n\u201chard core\u201d and because it is the part that has attracted\nthe most interest.\n",
