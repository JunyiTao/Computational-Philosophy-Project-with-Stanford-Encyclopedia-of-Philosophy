As\nLeibniz remarks, this principle \u201cmust be considered one of the\ngreatest and most fruitful of all human knowledge, for upon it is built\na great part of metaphysics, physics, and moral science\u201d (G VII\n301/L 227). In the Principles of Nature and Grace, Leibniz\nsuggests that the claim that nothing takes place without a sufficient\nreason means that nothing happens in such a way that it is impossible\nfor someone with enough information to give a reason why it is so and\nnot otherwise. In the Monadology and elsewhere, however,\nLeibniz frankly admits that \u201cmost of the time these reasons\ncannot be known to us\u201d (G VI 612/AG 217). While the idea that\nevery event must have a cause and that there is a reason why everything\nis so and not otherwise again might not seem novel, it is the\nconnection that Leibniz sees between this principle and his other\nmetaphysical principles that is noteworthy. According to Leibniz, PSR\nmust actually follow from PIN, for if there were a truth that had no\nreason, then there would be a proposition whose subject did not contain\nthe predicate, which is a violation of Leibniz's conception of\ntruth.\n",
