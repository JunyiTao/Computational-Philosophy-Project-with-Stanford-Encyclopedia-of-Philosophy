    "main_text": "Informal Logic and Argument Interpretation || Rhetorical approaches and power differences\n3.2 Rhetorical approaches and power differences\n\nRhetorical studies attend to argument audiences in a way that can help\nto address feminist concerns about the emotional and gendered aspects\nof argument (Tindale 1999: 201). They may also help to resolve a\ndilemma of feminist arguing practice by demonstrating how the\nadvancement of feminist affirmative projects, such as acknowledging\nthe significance of women\u2019s experience, may require adversarial\nforms of argumentation often associated with masculinity.\nCommunication styles identified as rhetoric create both problematic\nand constructive aspects of social identity, including feminine\nidentity. Rhetorical analysis of the situational specifics can reveal\nhow communication helps to produce social identities and can suggest\nways to address particular power differences among reasoners (Bruner\n1996; Palczewski 2016).\n\nM. Lane Bruner argues that some aspects of gender stereotypes make it\nharder to argue, while other aspects make it easier (1996).\nDistinguishing the empowering from the disempowering aspects of social\nidentity depends on examining the ways in which\n\u201cmasculine\u201d identity is tied up with ideals of arguing and\nthe ways in which identity politics can counteract the power of\ndominant identities. Although speakers must suppress each of their\nunique differences from others in order to communicate explicitly in\nregard to their own social positions, the resulting feminine and\nmasculine identifications do not become fixed. Because identities are\ncreated, they must be maintained and they remain subject to\ntransformation. That flux in identity gives feminists strategic\nopportunities for developing women\u2019s argumentation and giving\ncredit to it.\n\nRooney notes that an artificial severing of arguing from narrative and\nrhetorical practices helps to dissociate arguments from femininity and\nfrustrates feminist practices of philosophical arguing (2010; Le\nDoeuff 1980 [1989]). Research that attends to rhetoric and its\ninfluences may go under the name of \u201crhetorical studies\u201d\n(often in English or literature departments) but may also be found in\ncommunications studies, psychology, and interdisciplinary fields such\nas women\u2019s and gender studies or argumentation studies.\nRhetorical studies give attention to the perspective of a particular\naudience and that concern with the audience and the various interests\naudiences may have challenges the view\u2014especially in the\ndiscipline of philosophy\u2014that reasoning and argumentation must\nbe a constant battle. Rooney argues that philosophical practice itself\ninvolves rhetoric and narrative through myths, thought experiments,\nand metaphors. These rhetorical practices make theories more\nattractive to specific audiences. Philosophers commonly portray reason\nas in battle against feminine forces which \u201cprimarily makes\nsense to men among men in cultural contexts where sexism or misogyny\nis a cultural given\u201d (2010: 227).\n\nRhetorical studies of speakers, audiences, their purposes, and their\nsocial contexts were revived in twentieth century argumentation theory\nby Chaim Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca (1958 [1969]). Perelman,\nwriting on his own, advocates that instead of appealing to \u201cthe\nrational\u201d as a standard for argumentation, scholars should\nconsider a \u201creasonable\u201d person in terms of the standards\nof a particular community (1977 [1982]).\n\nThe discipline of rhetorical studies typically takes persuasion to be\nthe goal of arguing. Some feminists resist this assumption. Concern\nthat persuasion may be intrinsically an act of domination of one\nperson over another and even an act of violence (Gearhart 1979) led\nfeminist rhetoricians to develop an alternative in \u201cinvitational\nrhetoric\u201d that makes understanding the goal of arguing (Foss\n& Griffin 1995; Bone et al. 2008). This approach resonates with\nrhetoric\u2019s Aristotelian history, Christopher Tindale observes,\nwhich does not involve intentions to change another person that some\nfeminists consider violent, because Aristotle conceives change as an\ninternal process. On Tindale\u2019s model of \u201crhetorical\nargumentation\u201d,\n\n\nthe audience, when persuaded, is persuaded by its own deliberations,\nafter reflection on reasoning that it has understood in its own terms\nand may even have had a hand in completing. (1999: 191)\n\n\nHowever, at the same time, invitational rhetoric demands a civility\nthat may presume social equality (Lozano-Reich & Cloud 2009) and\nthus it faces the same problems as politeness (addressed in\n Section 2).\n\nLinker suggests that reasoning across power differences can be aided\nby speakers employing a process of \u201cintellectual empathy\u201d;\nother people\u2019s claims, especially if these people are relatively\ndisadvantaged, can help reflect on one\u2019s own interpretive\nassumptions in order to move past unreflective bias (2011; 2015).\nRelatedly, an attitude of playfulness may facilitate consideration of\nanother\u2019s perspective, that is, \u201ctravelling\u201d to the\nperson\u2019s \u201cworld\u201d as described by Maria Lugones\n(1987). Perhaps this attitude will help philosophers appreciate the\nviewpoints presented in feminist epistemology (Lang 2010). However,\nMariana Ortega (2006) warns that the radical potential of playfulness\ndemands a deep engagement with work by women of color. Superficial\ncitation of women of color by white feminists only replicates\noppressive gatekeeping in philosophical argumentation.\n\nAssuming the goal of arguing to be persuasion invokes a limited\ncontext and one that poses problems for some feminists, especially\nregarding power differences among speakers. Nevertheless, rhetorical\nanalysis offers many resources for feminist analysis because its\nattention to the audience provides valuable details about the\nsituations in which people argue. As we will see next, recent work in\nphilosophy concerning credibility and developing the concept of\n\u201cargumentative injustice\u201d articulates persistent concerns\nfor feminists about arguing, as does both regular and feminist\nphilosophical scholarship about fallacies and critical thinking\neducation.\n",
