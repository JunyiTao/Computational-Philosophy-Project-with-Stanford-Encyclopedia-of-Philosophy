    "main_text": "The Value of True Belief\n9. The Value of Extended Knowledge\n\nIn his essay, \u201cMeno in a Digital World\u201d, Pascal\nEngel (2016) questions whether the original value problem applies to\nthe kind of knowledge or pseudo-knowledge that we get from the\ninternet? (2016: 1). One might initially think that internet and/or\ndigitally acquired knowledge raises no new issues for the value\nproblem. On this line of thought, if digitally acquired (e.g., Googled\nknowledge, information stored in iPhone apps, etc.) is\ngenuine knowledge, then whatever goes for knowledge more\ngenerally, vis-\u00e0-vis the value problems surveyed in\n\u00a7\u00a71\u20132, thereby goes for knowledge acquired from our\ngadgets.\n\nHowever, recent work at the intersection of epistemology and the\nphilosophy of mind suggests there are potentially some new and\nepistemologically interesting philosophical problems associated with\nthe value of technology-assisted knowledge. These problems correspond\nwith two ways of conceiving of knowledge as extending beyond\ntraditional, intracranial boundaries (e.g., Pritchard\u00a02018). In\nparticular, the kinds of \u2018extended knowledge\u2019 which have\npotential import for the value of knowledge debate correspond with the\nextended mind thesis (for discussion on how this thesis\ninterfaces with the hypothesis of extended cognition, see Carter,\nKallestrup, Pritchard, & Palermos 2014) and cases involving what\nMichael Lynch (2016) calls \u2018neuromedia\u2019 intelligence\naugmentation.\n\nAccording to the extended mind thesis (EMT), mental states\n(e.g., beliefs) can supervene in part on extra-organismic elements of\nthe world, such as laptops, phones and notebooks, that are typically\nregarded as \u2018external\u2019 to our minds. This thesis, defended\nmost notably by Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998), should not be\nconflated with comparatively weaker and less controversial thesis of\ncontent externalism (e.g., Putnam 1975; Burge 1986),\naccording to which the meaning or content of mental states can be\nfixed by extra-organismic features of our physical or\nsocial-linguistic environments.\n\nWhat the proponent of EMT submits is that mental states\nthemselves can partly supervene on extracranial artifacts\n(e.g., notebooks, iPhones) provided these extracranial artifacts play\nkinds of functional roles normally played by on-board, biological\ncognitive processes. For example, to borrow an (adapted) case from\nClark and Chalmers (1998), suppose an Alzheimer\u2019s patient,\n\u2018Otto\u2019, begins to outsource the task of memory storage and\nretrieval to his iPhone, having appreciated that his biological memory\nis failing. Accordingly, when Otto acquires new information, he\nautomatically records it in his phone\u2019s \u2018memory\napp\u2019, and when he needs old information, he (also, automatically\nand seamlessly) opens his memory app and looks it up. The iPhone comes\nto play for Otto the functionally isomorphic role that biological\nmemory used to play for him vis-\u00e0-vis the process of\nmemory storage and retrieval. Just as we attribute to normally\nfunctioning agents knowledge in virtue of their (non-occurrent)\ndispositional beliefs stored in biological memory (for example, five\nminutes ago, you knew that Paris is the capital of France), so, with\nEMT in play, we should be prepared to attribute knowledge to Otto in\nvirtue of the \u2018extended\u2019 (dispositional) beliefs which are\nstored in his notebook, provided Otto is as epistemically diligent in\nencoding and retrieving information as he was before (e.g., Pritchard\n2010b).\n\nThe import EMT has for the value of knowledge debate now takes shape:\nwhatever epistemically valuable properties (if any) are distinctively\npossessed by knowledge, they must be properties that obtain in\nOtto\u2019s case so as to add value to what would otherwise be\nmere true (dispositional) beliefs that are stored,\nextracranially, in Otto\u2019s iPhone. But it is initially puzzling\njust why, and how, this should be. After all, even if we accept the\nintuition that the epistemic value of traditional (intracranial)\nknowledge exceeds the value of corresponding true opinion, it is, as\nEngel (2016), Lynch (2016) and Carter (2017) have noted, at best not\nclear that this comparative intuition holds in the extended case,\nwhere knowledge is possessed simply by virtue of information\npersisting in digital storage.\n\nFor example, consider again Plato\u2019s solution to the value\nproblem canvassed in\n \u00a71:\n knowledge, unlike true belief, must be \u2018tied-down\u2019 to the\ntruth. Mere true belief is more likely to be lost, which makes it less\nvaluable than knowledge. One potential worry is that extended\nknowledge, as per EMT\u2014literally, often times, knowledge stored\nin the cloud\u2014is by its very nature not \u2018tethered\u2019,\nor for that matter even tetherable, in a way that corresponding items\nof accurate information which fall short of knowledge are not. Nor\narguably does this sort of knowledge in the cloud clearly have the\nkind of \u2018stability\u2019 that Olsson (2009) claims is what\ndistinguishes knowledge from true opinion (cf., Walker 2019). Perhaps\neven less does it appear to constitute a valuable cognitive\n\u2018achievement\u2019, as per robust virtue epistemologists such\nas Greco and Sosa.\n\nEMT is of course highly controversial, (see, for example, Adams &\nAizawa 2008), and so one way to sidestep the implications for the\nvalue of knowledge debate posed by the possibility of knowledge that\nis extended via extended beliefs, is to simply resist EMT as\na thesis about the metaphysics of mind.\n\nHowever, there are other ways in which the technology-assisted\nknowledge could have import for the traditional value problems. In\nrecent work, Michael P. Lynch (2016) argues that, given the increase\nin cognitive offloading coupled with evermore subtle and physically\nsmaller intelligence-augmentation technologies (e.g., Bostrom &\nSandberg 2009), it is just a matter of time before the majority of the\ngadgetry we use for cognitive tasks will be by and large seamless and\n\u2018invisible\u2019. Lynch suggests that while coming to know via\nsuch mechanisms can make knowledge acquisition much easier, there are\nepistemic drawbacks. He offers the following thought experiment:\n\n\nNEUROMEDIA: Imagine a society where smartphones are miniaturized and\nhooked directly into a person\u2019s brain. With a single mental\ncommand, those who have this technology\u2014let\u2019s call it\nneuromedia\u2014can access information on any subject [\u2026] Now\nimagine that an environmental disaster strikes our invented society\nafter several generations have enjoyed the fruits of neuromedia. The\nelectronic communication grid that allows neuromedia to function is\ndestroyed. Suddenly no one can access the shared cloud of information\nby thought alone. [\u2026] for the inhabitants of this society,\nlosing neuromedia is an immensely unsettling experience; it\u2019s\nlike a normally sighted person going blind. They have lost a way of\naccessing information on which they\u2019ve come to rely [\u2026]\nJust as overreliance on one sense can weaken the others, so\noverdependence on neuromedia might atrophy the ability to access\ninformation in other ways, ways that are less easy and require more\ncreative effort. (Lynch 2016: 1\u20136)\n\n\nOne conclusion Lynch has drawn from such thought experiments is that\nunderstanding has a value that mere knowledge lacks, a position\nwe\u2019ve seen has been embraced for different reasons in\n \u00a74\n by Kvanvig and others. A further conclusion, advanced by Pritchard\n(2013) and Carter (2017), concerns the extent to which the acquisition\nof knowledge involves \u2018epistemic dependence\u2019\u2014viz.,\ndependence on factors outwith one\u2019s cognitive agency. They argue\nthat the greater the scope of epistemic dependence, the more valuable\nit becomes to cultivate virtues like intellectual autonomy that\nregulate the appropriate reliance and outsourcing (e.g., on other\nindividuals, technology, medicine, etc.) while at the same time\nmaintaining one\u2019s intellectual self-direction.\n",
