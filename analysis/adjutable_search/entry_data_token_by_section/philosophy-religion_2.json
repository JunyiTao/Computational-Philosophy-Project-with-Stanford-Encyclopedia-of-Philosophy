    "main_text": "The Meaning of Religious Beliefs || Positivism\n2.1 Positivism\n\n\u201cPositivism\u201d is a term introduced by Auguste Comte\n(1798\u20131857), a French philosopher who championed the natural and\nsocial sciences over against theology and the philosophical practice\nof metaphysics. The term \u201cpositivism\u201d was used later\n(sometimes amplified to Logical Positivism by A.J. Ayer) by a\ngroup of philosophers who met in Austria called the Vienna Circle from\n1922 to 1938. This group, which included Moritz Schlick and Max\nPlanck, advanced an empirical account of meaning, according to which\nfor a proposition to be meaningful it needed either to be a conceptual\nor formal statement in mathematics or about analytic definitions\n(\u201ctriangles have three angles\u201d) or about matters that can\nbe empirically verified or falsified. Ostensibly factual claims that\ndo not make any difference in terms of our actual (or possible)\nempirical experience are void of meaning. A British philosopher, who\nvisited the Vienna Circle, A.J. Ayer popularized this criterion of\nmeaning in his 1936 book, Language, Truth, and Logic. In it,\nAyer argued that religious claims as well as their denial were without\ncognitive content. By his lights, theism, and also atheism and\nagnosticism, were nonsense, because they were about the reality (or\nunreality or unknowability) of that which made no difference to our\nempirical experience. How might one empirically confirm or disconfirm\nthat there is an incorporeal, invisible God or that Krishna is an\navatar of Vishnu? Famously, Antony Flew employed this strategy in his\nlikening the God of theism to a belief that there is an undetectable,\ninvisible gardener who could not be heard or smelled or otherwise\nempirically discovered (Flew 1955). In addition to rejecting\ntraditional religious beliefs as meaningless, Ayer and other logical\npositivists rejected the meaningfulness of moral statements. By their\nlights, moral or ethical statements were expressions of persons\u2019\nfeelings, not about values that have a reality independent of\npersons\u2019 feelings.\n\nThe logical positivist critique of religion is not dead. It can be\nseen at work in Herman Philipse\u2019s God in the Age of Science;\nA Critique of Religious Reasons (2012). Still, the criterion of\nmeaning advanced by logical positivism faced a series of objections\n(for details see Copleston 1960 and Taliaferro 2005b).\n\nConsider five objections that were instrumental in the retreat of\nlogical positivism from its position of dominance.\n\nFirst, it was charged that logical positivism itself is self-refuting.\nIs the statement of its standard of meaning (propositions are\nmeaningful if and only if they are about the relations of ideas or\nabout matters that are subject to empirical verification or\nfalsification) itself about the relations of ideas or about matters\nthat are subject to empirical verification or falsification? Arguably\nnot. At best, the positivist criterion of meaning is a recommendation\nabout what to count as meaningful.\n\nSecond, it was argued that there are meaningful statements about the\nworld that are not subject to direct or indirect empirical\nconfirmation or disconfirmation. Plausible candidates include\nstatements about the origin of the cosmos or, closer to home, the\nmental states of other persons or of nonhuman animals (for discussion,\nsee Van Cleve 1999 and Taliaferro 1994).\n\nThird, limiting human experience to what is narrowly understood to be\nempirical seemed to many philosophers to be arbitrary or capricious.\nC. D. Broad and others defended a wider understanding of experience to\nallow for the meaningfulness of moral experience: arguably, one can\nexperience the wrongness of an act as when an innocent person feels\nherself to be violated.\n\nFourth, Ayer\u2019s rejection of the meaningfulness of ethics seemed\nto cut against his epistemology or normative account of beliefs, for\nhe construed empirical knowledge in terms of having the right to\ncertain beliefs. If it is meaningful to refer to the right to beliefs,\nwhy is it not meaningful to refer to moral rights such as the right\nnot to be tortured? And if we are countenancing a broader concept of\nwhat may be experienced, in the tradition of phenomenology (which\ninvolves the analysis of appearances) why rule out, as a matter of\nprinciple, the experience of the divine or the sacred?\n\nFifth, and probably most importantly in terms of the history of ideas,\nthe seminal philosopher of science Carl Hempel (1905\u20131997)\ncontended that the project of logical positivism was too limited\n(Hempel 1950). It was insensitive to the broader task of scientific\ninquiry which is properly conducted not on the tactical scale of\nscrutinizing particular claims about empirical experience but in terms\nof a coherent, overall theory or view of the world. According to\nHempel, we should be concerned with empirical inquiry but see this as\ndefined by an overall theoretical understanding of reality and the\nlaws of nature. This was not ipso facto a position that\nfavored the meaningfulness of religious belief, but Hempel\u2019s\ncriticism of positivism removed their barrier for overall metaphysical\naccounts of reality, be these accounts theistic, pantheistic (roughly,\nGod is everything), naturalistic, and so on. Moreover, the positivist\ncritique of what they called metaphysics was attacked as confused as\nsome metaphysics was implied in their claims about empirical\nexperience; see the aptly titled classic The Metaphysics of\nLogical Positivism (1954) by Gustav Bergmann\n(1906\u20131987).\n\nLet us now turn to Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951) and the philosophy\nof religion his work inspired.\n",
