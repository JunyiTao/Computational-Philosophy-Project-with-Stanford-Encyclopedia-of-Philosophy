    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s life was shaped by the\npolitical situation in central Asia in the generations just before the\nMongol conquest of that region. He was born in the Persian city of\nRayy, near modern-day Tehran, in 1149 CE (544 of the Muslim calendar).\nThe name \u201cR\u0101z\u012b\u201d refers to this birthplace,\nleading to potential confusion with other philosophers from Rayy,\nincluding the earlier Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 920) and the\nlater Qu\u1e6db al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (d.1364). Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn did not stay in Rayy, but traveled widely throughout\nPersia and central Asia for the rest of his life in search of\neducation, patronage, and worthy intellectual opponents. In fact, he\ndid not need to venture far for his initial education. His father was\nan expert in Islamic theology and law, a second-generation student of\nthe major Ash\u02bfarite thinker al-Juwayn\u012b (d.1085). Thus the\nyoung Fakhr al-D\u012bn was from early on trained in the rational\ntheology (kal\u0101m) of the Ash\u02bfarite school and the\nlegal system of his father\u2019s Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b school. He\nwent on to study in Nishapur, where he first encountered the works of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d.950\u201351) and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n(Avicenna, d.1037). Responding to the latter would become the central\nproject of his own philosophical career. At Mar\u0101gha, he studied\nwith the teacher Majd al-D\u012bn al-J\u012bl\u012b (d. after 1175).\nAl-Suhraward\u012b (d. 1191), the famous founder of the\n\u201cIlluminationist\u201d philosophical tradition, was also a\nstudent of al-J\u012bl\u012b\u2019s.\n\nThe mature career of Fakhr al-D\u012bn has been divided into three\nphases in a recent detailed overview of his life (Griffel 2021:\n264\u2013303; see also Street 1997, Griffel 2007, Alta\u015f 2013a\nand 2013b, Shihadeh 2022). These phases were marked by patronage\nrelationships with two political powers who were vying for dominance\nin central Asia, the Khw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs and the Gh\u016brids.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn first enjoyed the support of the\nKhw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs for about two decades, before joining the\nGh\u016brids in 1197 after a military defeat of the\nKhw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs at the hands of the Gh\u016brids. By all\naccounts this led to great wealth and standing, as Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nbecame an ornament to the Gh\u016brid court and a close companion and\nteacher of the sultan Ghiy\u0101th al-D\u012bn (d.1203). This did not\nmean he could stay above the political fray, though. He was accused of\nlingering loyalty to the enemies of the court and was also involved in\na religious rivalry between Ash\u02bfarism and the more literalist,\nless rationalist Karr\u0101mite theological movement. His travels in\nTransoxania seeking out debates with other jurists and theologians\nhave similarly been explained as an attempt to promote Ash\u02bfarite\nkal\u0101m against Matur\u012bd\u012b opponents, and\nSh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b legal thought against Hanbal\u012b opponents\n(for his legal thought see, e.g., Opwis 2012, Ba\u015fo\u011flu 2014).\nIn a record of these encounters around the year 1186, called\nDebates (Mun\u0101\u1e93ar\u0101\u1e6d), Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn presents himself as \u201cthe only respectable scholar\namong a swarm of dimwits\u201d (Griffel 2021: 296; for this work see\nKholeif 1966). At the end of his life, we see a third phase of\npatronage as he rejoins the Khw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs after they take\nthe city of Herat from the Gh\u016brids. Fakhr al-D\u012bn died two\nyears later in that city, in 1210 CE (606 of the Muslim calendar).\n\nDespite his extensive travels and political maneuvering, Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn found time to compose a startlingly large body of work.\nMany will associate his name most immediately with his titanic\nGreat Commentary on the Quran (also called Keys to the\nHidden: Maf\u0101\u1e6dih al-ghayb). The modern\nprinting runs to no fewer than 32 volumes (here it is almost\nobligatory to cite Ibn Taymiyya\u2019s barb that the work\n\u201ccontains everything apart from exegesis of the Quran\u201d).\nFakhr al-D\u012bn wrote extensively on law, theology, and\n\u201coccult sciences\u201d like magic and astrology. As can be\nlearned from studies of his Quranic commentary (Jaffer 2015) and a\ntreatise of his on the occult disciplines (Noble 2021), every work of\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b can be profitably read with his\nphilosophical interests in mind. But in this overview we will largely\nrestrict our focus to the theological-philosophical treatises that are\nof most evident importance for the historian of philosophy. Scholars\nsometimes refer to these as summae, which suggests a parallel\nwith Latin scholastic works like those by Thomas Aquinas. The\ncomparison is not misleading, insofar as Fakhr al-D\u012bn was\navowedly a theologian, but one who pursued philosophical problems at\nlength and with great sophistication.\n\nA couple of problems confront anyone who is trying to come to grips\nwith his writings in this area. First, the sheer quantity of material.\nHis first summa, entitled Eastern Points of Investigation\non Metaphysics and Physics (al-Mab\u0101\u1e25ith\nal-mashriqiyya f\u012b \u02bfilm al-il\u0101hiyy\u0101t\nwa-l-\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bfiyy\u0101t) is more than 1200 pages\nlong in the modern printing. His final summa, written in his\nfinal years and arguably best representing his own views on a wide\nrange of topics, is the similarly titled Exalted Topics of Inquiry\nwithin Divine Science (al-Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib\nal-\u02bf\u0101liya min al-\u02bfilm al-il\u0101h\u012b) and is\nprinted in nine books bound in five volumes. In between these two\nworks we have, among other texts, the shorter but highly innovative\nand influential Mulakhkha\u1e63 al-\u1e25ikma (Epitome\nof Philosophy) and not one but two exegetical works devoted to\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Pointers and Reminders\n(al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t wa-l-tanb\u012bh\u0101t), a critical\nabridgment from 1201 (Lubab al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t) and an\nearlier, and very extensive, line-by-line critical commentary\n(Shar\u1e25 al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s decision to devote such a detailed\ncommentary to a work by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 is historically revealing.\nWhile his contemporary Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b\n(d. before 1204) did compose a set of Doubts\n(Shuk\u016bk) on the same text, the commentary of\nal-R\u0101z\u012b on al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t seems to be the\nfirst lemmatized exegesis of an Arabic philosophical work (see also\nWisnovsky 2013, Shihadeh 2014 and 2017), as had been devoted to\nAristotle in late antiquity and earlier Arabic philosophy. Even a\ncasual perusal of Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s corpus makes clear that he\nhas identified Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 as the chief representative of\nfalsafa, a word which is most naturally translated\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d (since it is likewise derived from the Greek\nphilosophia) but which really has a narrower meaning in this\nperiod, since it is so closely tied to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\ndistinctive teachings. To be a faylas\u016bf is to uphold\nsuch doctrines as the necessary and eternal emanation of the universe\nfrom God. (A more generic word for the discussion of such issues,\nwithout any particular doctrinal commitment, would be\n\u1e25ikma, literally meaning \u201cwisdom\u201d; see\nGriffel 2021.) While Fakhr al-D\u012bn follows his famous predecessor\nand fellow Ash\u02bfarite al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (d. 1111) in targeting\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 as the outstanding exponent of falsafa, he\ndoes not go along with al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s idea that the\nfal\u0101sifa were heretics and apostates from Islam.\n\nInstead, he seems to welcome the powerful challenge posed by Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s thought, since it gives him something worthy of\nhis own considerable critical acumen and helps him to map out the wide\nrange of issues tackled in his summae. These fall into the\ndomains of logic, physics, psychology, ethics, and above all,\nmetaphysics (general survey in Zark\u0101n 1963). Indeed Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn used metaphysics to restructure the curriculum of the\nsciences, something we especially see in his Mulakhkha\u1e63\n(Eichner 2007, 2009). This work adopts a new arrangement, which would\nbe influential on later thinkers. Fakhr al-D\u012bn first tackles\nlogic, then \u201cgeneralities (al-um\u016br\nal-\u02bf\u0101mma)\u201d, then natural philosophy, and finally\nphilosophical theology. The second and fourth parts of the project\ncorrespond to what is called general and special metaphysics in the\nLatin scholastic tradition, and the parallel does not end there. Like\nDuns Scotus, Fakhr al-D\u012bn offers an analysis of existence (the\ncentral case of a metaphysical \u201cgenerality\u201d) by way of\ndisjunction, e.g., existence may be one or many, necessary or\ncontingent, infinite or finite, self-sufficient or dependent, etc.\nWhile these contrasts are largely drawn from Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn innovates with his systematic use of the disjunctions to\nstructure general metaphysics. This also means, as we will see below,\nthat his discussions of metaphysics are by no means restricted to\nraising and answering questions about God, as we might expect from a\n\u201ctheologian\u201d.\n\nIn fact, while Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s Ash\u02bfarite sympathies are\noften evident, and he does also write works that summarize\nkal\u0101m teachings, he is not consistent in taking a clear\nstance in favor of Ash\u02bfarite kal\u0101m and against\nAvicennan falsafa. Instead, the really stable feature of his\nwork is a method that is, again, reminiscent of Latin scholasticism\nand its genre of disputed questions. His various summae are\norganized into topics for inquiry (hence the use of words like\nmab\u0101\u1e25ith and ma\u1e6d\u0101lib in the\ntitles of the works), with arguments considered for and against every\nconceivable stance that could be adopted on each topic. (The famous\nSufi poet al-R\u016bm\u012b compared this approach to \u201ctearing\nscience apart like bread and feeding it to the birds\u201d.) The fact\nthat no actual historical figure or school has adopted a possible\nposition will not prevent Fakhr al-D\u012bn from considering it.\n\nBy using this \u201cdialectical\u201d procedure (Wisnovsky 2004,\nShihadeh 2005, Griffel 2011) Fakhr al-D\u012bn is able to stand in\njudgment over the whole historical tradition leading up to him.\nAlongside Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and other philosophers, notably the\nslightly earlier Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (d.\n1160s), the kal\u0101m tradition supplies him with a stock of\npositions and arguments to rehearse and critique. He will thus\nfrequently refer in the third person to \u201ctheologians\n(mutakallim\u016bn)\u201d, as if this were a group that does\nnot include him. The upshot is that Fakhr al-D\u012bn puts himself\nforward as the arbiter in debates that span the\nfalsafa-kal\u0101m divide. If he is not consistent in\nadopting one or another teaching himself (many times, a lengthy\ninvestigation in his works ends with only a brief statement of the\nlikeliest answer, or none at all, followed with a pious \u201cbut God\nknows best\u201d), this is perhaps because the exhaustive method of\ntesting arguments and doctrines is more important to him than the\nassertion of any one doctrine.\n",
