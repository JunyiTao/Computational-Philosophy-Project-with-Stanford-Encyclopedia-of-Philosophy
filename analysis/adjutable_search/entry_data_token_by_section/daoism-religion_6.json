    "main_text": "Origins of Daoist Religion || The Fangshi, or Masters of the Methods\n2.3 The Fangshi, or Masters of the Methods\n\nBesides the wu, a quite different class of practitioners is\nknown under the collective name of fangshi (\u201cmasters of\nthe methods\u201d or \u201cof the recipes\u201d). While they also\noperated within society as a whole, many fangshi were\nemployed by rulers from the 4th century BCE onwards. Their\nfields of expertise included different cosmological and esoteric arts:\nastronomy and astrology; divination and hemerology; medicine and\nhealing; alchemy; and sexual, breathing, and other longevity\npractices. In Anna Seidel\u2019s felicitous definition (1983a: 294),\nthe fangshi were people who had the \u201cknow-how\u201d.\nIn a broader perspective, it is important to note that several methods\noriginally associated with the fangshi were later\nincorporated into Daoist practices. With this class of practitioners,\nwe are in fact much closer to what Daoism would become in later times:\nas noted by John Lagerwey (1986: 282\u201383), not the\n\u201cshaman\u201d (with his or her ecstasies and trances), but the\n\u201cdiviner\u201d (who fashions a \u201crational\u201d world\nrelying on images and emblems with precise meanings and functions)\nis the predecessor of the Daoist master and the Daoist priest.\n\nUnlike those of the wu, several practices associated with the\nfangshi\u2014in particular, their mantic arts\u2014were\nbased on the Chinese cosmological system, which took shape in the\n3rd and 2nd centuries BCE (Harper 1999;\nCsikszentmihalyi 2000; Kalinowski 2004). Notes on the main features of\nthis system and its uses in Daoism will be found below\n (\u00a74.3).\n Here we should briefly note two points. First, Chinese cosmology is\nnot tied to any particular intellectual or technical legacy. Its\ncreation can be seen as the result of an effort to create a\ncomprehensive system open to application to a large variety of fields,\nwith contributions from specialists of various traditional\nsciences\u2014especially diviners, astronomers, and\nphysicians\u2014and from thinkers of different currents. Second, as\nwas noted by Isabelle Robinet (1997b: 260), \u201cunlike other\nreligions, we must look for the fundamental structure, the unity, and\nthe continuity of Taoism in its cosmological discourse and not in its\npantheon\u201d. While Daoism has had different pantheons in different\ntimes and places (see\n \u00a75.2),\n its views on the relation between Dao and cosmos have remained\nsubstantially unchanged throughout its history, and these views have\nusually been formulated on the basis of the standard Chinese\ncosmological system.\n",
