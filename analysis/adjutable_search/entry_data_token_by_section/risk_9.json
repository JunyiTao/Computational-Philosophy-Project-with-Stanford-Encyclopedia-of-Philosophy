The following are\nthree possible elements of a solution:\n\nIt may be useful to shift the focus from risks, described\ntwo-dimensionally in terms of probability and severity (or\none-dimensionally as the product of these), to actions of risk-taking\nand risk-imposing. Such actions have many morally relevant properties\nin addition to the two dimensions mentioned, such as who contributes\ncausally to the risk and in what ways and with what intentions, and\nhow the risk and its associated benefits are distributed.\nImportant moral intuitions are accounted for by assuming that each\nperson has a prima facie moral right not to be exposed to risk of\nnegative impact, such as damage to her health or her property, through\nthe actions of others. However, this is a prima facie right that has\nto be overridden in quite a few cases, in order to make social life at\nall possible. Therefore, the recognition of this right gives rise to\nwhat can be called an exemption problem, namely the problem\nof determining when it is rightfully overridden. \nPart of the solution to the exemption problem may be obtained by\nallowing for reciprocal exchanges of risks and benefits. Hence, if\nA is allowed to drive a car, exposing B to certain\nrisks, then in exchange B is allowed to drive a car, exposing\nA to the corresponding risks. In order to deal with the\ncomplexities of modern society, this principle must also be applied to\nexchanges of different types of risks and benefits. Exposure of a\nperson to a risk can then be regarded as acceptable if it is part of\nan equitable social system of risk-taking that works to her advantage.\nSuch a system can be required to contain mechanisms that eliminate, or\ncompensate for, social inequalities that are caused by disease and\ndisability. (Hansson 2003; 2013)\n\n\nDiscussions on the overall issue of risk acceptance can be found in\nMacpherson (2008), Hansson (2013) and Oberdiek (2014). Justice in risk\nimpositions is discussed in Ferretti 2010 and Heyward & Roser\n2016. Issues of rights and risks are discussed in Thomson 1986 and,\nwith a particular emphasis on responsibilities, in Kermisch 2012 and\nvan de Poel, et al. 2012.\n",
