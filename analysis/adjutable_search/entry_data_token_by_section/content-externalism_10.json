    "main_text": "Extended Mind || Process-Oriented Extended Mind\n5.3 Process-Oriented Extended Mind\n\nState-oriented extended mind identifies a mental state (e.g., a\nbelief) with an external structure (e.g., a sentence). However, mental\nstates are not the only candidates for the vehicles of content. Mental\nacts\u2014thinking, believing (or judging), remembering,\netc.\u2014have at least as much claim to be regarded as such\nvehicles. And switching the focus from states to acts affords the\npossibility of a more process-oriented interpretation of extended mind. We might regard Otto\u2019s notebook as an item of scaffolding in roughly the sense championed by Vygotsky (1934 [1962]). In these terms, the state-oriented version of extended mind identifies a mental state with a piece of this scaffolding\u2014if this piece plays the requisite functional role. In the process-oriented version of extended mind, focus switches from the scaffolding to the process of manipulating the scaffolding. This manipulating of the scaffolding can, on the process-oriented version of extended mind, form part of a cognitive process.\n\nThe process-oriented version of extended mind would interpret\nthe case of Otto rather differently. There is no identification of a\nmental state with an external structure\u2014a belief with a\nsentence. Rather, there is, first of all, a mental process. Describing\nthis as a process of believing is, perhaps, a little forced: a process\nof remembering seems more apt. When Otto engages with, or\nmanipulates, his notebook\u2014flipping through the pages,\nand scanning each page\u2014this manipulation forms part of his\nprocess of remembering the location of the Museum of Modern Art. This\nis only part of the process, of course: little remembering would get\ndone without a suitable contribution from the brain. Nevertheless,\nOtto\u2019s manipulation of the book is part of that process.\n\nTwo distinct types of motivation can be identified for this claim. The\nfirst is a broadly functionalist one, akin to the functionalist\nmotivation for state-oriented extended mind. The idea is that\nthe computational profile of the process of manipulating the book is\nbroadly similar to that of internal processes responsible for\ncognition (Wilson 1994, 2004; Clark 1989, 1997, 2008a, 2008b; Rowlands 1999, 2010, Wheeler\n2010). Standard accounts of cognition postulate information-bearing structures (roughly, representations) and transformative processes performed on those structures, where these processes have the function of identifying information and making it available either to the cognitive subject or to further processing operations. Thus, for example, David Marr\u2019s canonical account of vision postulates a series of information-bearing structures\u2014retinal image, raw primal sketch, full primal sketch, and so on, combined with operations that successively transform one structure into the next. The overall function of these processes is to identify and make available to the subject information that can be used to solve the task of seeing an object. Similarly, when Otto manipulates his notebook this, in general terms, is also what he seems to be doing: acting on information-bearing structures with a view to making available information that he needs to solve the cognitive task of remembering the location of The Museum of Modern Art. From this suitably abstract computational perspective, it is argued, there does not seem to be a huge amount of difference between internal processes performed by the brain on information-bearing structures and external processes performed by the organism on information-bearing structures. They have\nthe same abstract computational profile and purpose.\n\nAnother type of argument draws its inspiration from the\nphenomenological tradition. Wheeler (2005), for example, draws on the\nwork of Heidegger (1927 [1962]) in defending a version of extended mind. Rowlands (2010), developing certain themes implicit in\nHusserl and Sartre, defends a model of intentionality as revealing\nactivity: the presenting (revealing or disclosing) of an object\nas falling under a given mode of presentation. While the activity\nthrough which this presentation occurs can be purely\ninternal\u2014i.e., neural or neurocomputational activity\u2014it\nneed not be, and typically is not. Often this internal activity is\ncombined with actions performed by an organism on the world around it.\nOn this view, when Otto manipulates his book, he is engaging in\nrevealing activity: The Museum of Modern Art is revealed, disclosed or\npresented as being located on East 53rd Street. This\nrevealing activity comprises both activity occurring in Otto\u2019s\nbrain and wider activity performed by Otto on the world. As revealing\nactivity, therefore, the process of remembering occurs partly inside\nOtto and partly outside him.\n\nWhether computationally or phenomenologically inspired,\nprocess-oriented extended mind may fare better with\nthe objections that were leveled at its state-oriented counterpart.\nThe bloat objection seems to have less purchase on process-oriented\nextended mind. For example, Otto\u2019s act of remembering\nextends no further than the things he does to and with his notebook.\nThere is no reason for thinking that it extends into things such an\nencyclopedia or the internet that Otto is not currently manipulating\nor exploiting.\n\nThe original intentionality objection is also, at least partly,\ndeflected. In this amalgamated process, that combines things going on\nboth inside and outside Otto\u2019s skin, there is original\nintentionality aplenty. Otto has to read what he scans on each page,\nand his seeing will have original intentionality. He will have to\nunderstand what he sees, and this understanding will also have\noriginal intentionality. Therefore, the overall process is not at all\ndevoid of original intentionality (Menary 2006, 2007). It can,\nhowever, can be objected that this original intentionality is confined\nto segments of the process that are located exclusively inside\nOtto\u2019s skin (Adams 2010). A response to this objection might\ntake two forms. One is to accept the claim, and argue that it does not\nmatter. In this vein, one might point to that the fact that it would\nbe extremely implausible to require that every internal part of a\ncognitive process, understood neuro-physiologically or\ncomputationally, must possess original intentionality. A retinal\nimage, for example, might possess original intentionality of a sort.\nThe visual representation into which this image is progressively\ntransformed by constructive operations on the part of the brain would,\nprobably, possess original intentionality. But those constructive\noperations would not (Rowlands 2010). The other option is to deny the\nclaim. This would require showing that at least some things that are\nnot located in or at the skin possess original intentionality.\nRowlands (2006), for example, argues that this is true of what he\ncalls pre-intentional actions or doings. The debate\nis ongoing, and it is not clear whether there is an answer that would\nconvince both parties.\n",
