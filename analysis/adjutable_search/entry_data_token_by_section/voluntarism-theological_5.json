    "main_text": "Metaethical theological voluntarism || Which evaluative statuses?\n2.2 Which evaluative statuses?\n\nA metaethical view can be more or less comprehensive, aiming to cover\nmore or fewer evaluative statuses. A metaethical view might claim to\nprovide an account of all evaluative notions, or of all normative\nnotions, or of all moral notions, or or some set of moral notions.\n(Roughly, and taking the notion of an evaluative property as\nfundamental: for a notion to be normative is for it to be a certain\nsort of evaluative notion, one that is essentially action-guiding; for\na notion to be moral is for it to be a certain sort of normative\nnotion, one that exhibits impartiality.) No one claims that\ntheological voluntarism provides an account of all evaluative notions.\nThe real contenders are the latter three.\n\nThere are good reasons to reject the claim that all normative notions\nare to be understood in relation to God\u2019s will. The main reason\nis that, as we will see below, it is important that there be items\nwith normative statuses independent of God\u2019s will in order to\nexplain how God\u2019s will, even if free, is not arbitrary. And it\nis not as if the view that some normative statuses are not to be\nexplained in terms of God\u2019s will must be repugnant to a\ntheocentric metaethics: for, after all, one might understand such\nstatuses in theological, even if not voluntaristic, terms. Adams, for\nexample, understands some notions of goodness in terms of likeness to\nGod, an understanding that is unquestionably theocentric though not\nvoluntaristic (Adams 1999, pp. 28\u201338; also Murphy 2011, pp.\n148\u2013160).\n\nMost of the current debate over the evaluative statuses to be\nexplained by theological voluntarism, then, concerns whether the\nentire set or only some proper subset of moral statuses is to be\nunderstood in both theological and voluntaristic terms. Quinn\u2019s\n1978 work offers a theological voluntarist view on which all moral\nstatuses are to be understood in terms of God\u2019s will. But Adams\nrejects this view, and Quinn, following Adams and Alston (1990),\neventually rejected it as well. These writers hold that only moral\nproperties in the \u201cobligation family,\u201d properties like\nthose of being obligatory, being permissible,\nbeing required, and being right (where being\nright involves a constraint on conduct, rather than being merely\nfitting), are to be understood in theological voluntarist terms. Call\ntheir view the restricted moral view; call the view that all\nmoral statuses are to be understood in voluntarist terms the\nunrestricted moral view.\n\nThe restricted moral view has been defended with more and less\nimpressive arguments. (See Murphy 2012.) The less impressive arguments\nare those that appeal to the idea that there must be moral properties\nthat are not explained in terms of God\u2019s will in order to deal\nwith some of the classic objections to theological voluntarism. To\npreserve the notion that God is good, one might say, we need to\nrestrict the aspirations of theological voluntarism to those of\nexplaining a proper subset of moral notions, leaving the remainder for\nan account of God\u2019s goodness; or, to make intelligible the\ncommands that God chooses to give, we need to set aside some group of\nmoral notions to be explained in other than theological voluntarist\nterms and that can therefore enter into our account of the\nintelligibility of God\u2019s choices to give certain commands rather\nthan others. But these considerations are not, after all, entirely\npersuasive. For one might well explain the notion that God is good and\naccount for the intelligibility of divine commands by appeal to\nnormative notions that are nonmoral. (See Section 3\n below\n for further discussion of these arguments.)\n\nMore plausible are arguments that suggest that there is something in\nparticular about obligation that makes it fit for a theological\nvoluntarist explanation, some feature that is not shared with notions\nlike moral virtue and moral good. Adams suggests, with some\nplausibility, that the notion of obligation is ineliminably social,\nthat it must involve a relationship between persons, a relationship in\nwhich a demand is made (Adams 1987b, p. 264; also Adams 1999, pp.\n245\u2013246; for a nontheistic view defending a similar position,\nsee Darwall 2006). This feature of obligation makes it different from\nnotions of goodness and virtue, which do not seem to have this\nessentially social element. That obligation is special in this way\ndoes not, of course, show that notions of moral virtue and moral\ngoodness do not also need to be treated in a theological voluntarist\nway. It could be that even if obligation most obviously requires this\ntreatment, the points made earlier about the promise of theological\nvoluntarism also extend to other moral notions, even if in a less\npressing way. (See\n Section 3.3\n for further discussion, and evaluation, of this point.)\n\nThere are no obviously decisive reasons for the theological\nvoluntarist to adhere to either the restricted or the unrestricted\nmoral view. (For a set of arguments that the restricted theological\nvoluntarists have failed to avoid objections to theological\nvoluntarism while leaving the positive arguments for the view intact,\nsee Murphy 2012.) But theological voluntarists have wanted to say at\nleast that the properties in the obligation family are to be accounted\nfor in terms of this view. In the remainder of this article, it will\nbe assumed that theological voluntarism is about properties in the\nobligation family, though we will occasionally consider how the view\ncould be extended to other moral properties as well. \n",
