    "main_text": "Contemporary Debates || The Privacy of Animals\n4.8 The Privacy of Animals\n\nAlan Westin (1967) surveyed several studies of animals, demonstrating\nthat a desire for privacy is not restricted to humans. One of the more\nrecent contemporary debates on privacy concerns the question of\nwhether animals should have (a right to) privacy. Pepper (2020)\ndefends such a right, since nonhuman animals also have an\n\n\ninterest in shaping different kinds of relationships with one another\nby giving us control over how we present ourselves to others\u2026\nwhich grounds a right against us. (2020: 628; see also Paci et al.\n2022)\n\n",
