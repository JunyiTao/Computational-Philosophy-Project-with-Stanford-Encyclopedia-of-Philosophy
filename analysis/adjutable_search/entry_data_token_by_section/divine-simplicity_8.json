Preserving Divine Transcendence While Avoiding Negative Theology\n\nSo far we have explored how God can be (i) identical to his nature,\n(ii) identical to his existence, and (iii) such that his\nomni-attributes are identical to one another. But a very serious\nproblem remains, a problem that arises when we consider properties in\nsome sense shared by God and creatures. It is obvious that the divine\nperfections cannot be shared with creatures: only God is perfectly\npowerful, wise, good, and so on. Socrates is at best imperfectly\npowerful, wise, good, and so on. But there must be some properties\nthat God and creatures share if God is not to be a wholly other than\ncreatures and out of all relation to them. These shared properties,\nhowever, pose a threat to DDS as we shall see in a moment. The problem\nin a nutshell is to reconcile the divine transcendence, of which DDS\nis an expression, with the need for some commensurability between God\nand creatures. The problem, in other words, is to find a way of\npreserving transcendence while avoiding a self-vitiating negative\ntheology according to which nothing can be positively affirmed of God,\nnot even that he exists.\n\nGod is powerful, but so is Socrates. The use of \u2018powerful\u2019\nin \u2018God is powerful\u2019 and \u2018Socrates is\npowerful\u2019 is not equivocal. That God is perfectly powerful while\nSocrates is imperfectly powerful does not alter the fact that both are\npowerful. Whether a thing is perfectly powerful or imperfectly\npowerful, it is powerful. There is a difference in degree of power,\nbut the difference in degree seems to presuppose (and thus entail) a\nsameness in respect of being powerful. Now if God and Socrates are\nboth powerful, then God has a property with which he is not identical,\nnamely, the property of being powerful, and this contradicts DDS. For\nif God is identical with the property of being powerful, then he\ncannot share this property with Socrates. The argument, then, is\nthis:\n\nNecessarily, for any x, if x is perfectly\n(maximally) F, then x is F.\n\n\nFrom (1) together with the premise that God is perfectly powerful, it\nfollows that\n\nGod is powerful.\n\n\nBut among creatures we also find agents of varying degrees of power,\nso it is also true that\n\nSocrates is powerful.\n\n\nIt follows from (2) and (3) that\n\nThere are properties that God and creatures share.\n\n\nIf x and y share a property P, then\nP is distinct from both x and y.\nTherefore,\n\nThere are properties of God with which God is not identical, which\nimplies that DDS is false.\n\n",
