    "main_text": "Unorthodox Conceptions of Persons || Buddhist\n2.2 Buddhist\n\nThe next group of philosophers to consider in this section are the\nBuddhists. The Buddhist tradition is unique in having a clear concept\nof a person as distinct from a self. Mark Siderits sums up the\nBuddhist distinction between persons and selves succinctly: \u201cBy\n\u2018self\u2019 (a\u0304tman) they understand whatever\ncounts as the essence of the psychophysical complex, while by\n\u2018person\u2019 (pudgala) they understand the\npsychophysical complex as a whole\u201d (2019, 303). It is well-known\nthat the Buddhists reject the self, but it is not so well known that\nsome Buddhists defended the reality of persons. There are many\ndifferent Buddhist schools and the most well-known for an ardent\ndefenders of persons, against fellow Buddhists, are called\nPudgalav\u0101dins or personalists. The main impetus for the\nintroduction of persons in Buddhist philosophy, in the absence of\nselves, is the need for a bearer of moral responsibility. We need a\nbearer to support the notion of moral responsibility, which is a\nconstitutive element of their theory of karma and rebirth. Buddhists\nbelieve in rebirth without appeal to transmigration of self. All\nBuddhists allude to the Buddha\u2019s talk of persons in the\nBha\u0304raha\u0304rasu\u0304tra (the su\u0304tra on\nthe bearer of the burden) as one of the most important reasons to\nconsider the question about the reality of persons. The text reads as\nfollows:\n\nI am going to teach you, O monks, the burden, the taking up of the\nburden, the laying down of the burden, and the bearer of the burden.\nListen to it, pay attention carefully and well. I am going to speak.\nOf what does the burden consist? It consists of the five constituents\nto which one clings. Which five? The constituent to which one clings\nthat consists of corporeality, [and] the [four] constituents to which\none clings that consist of [affective] sensation, ideation, the\nconditioning factors, and cognition. Of what does the taking up of the\nburden consist? It consists of craving, which leads to rebirth [and]\nwhich, accompanied by desire for joys, takes delight here and there.\nOf what does the laying down of the burden consist? It is the total\nelimination, the abandonment, the removal, the exhaustion, the\navoidance, the cessation, the extinction, and the disappearance of\nthat very craving which leads to rebirth [and] which, accompanied by\ndesire for joys, takes delight here and there. Of what does the bearer\nof the burden consist? One could say: \u2018A person\u2019, i.e.,\nthat sir who has such a name, who has such an origin(/birth), who\nbelongs to such a family(/lineage), who has such a livelihood, who\nexperiences such pleasure and pain, who has such a long life span, who\nremains for such a long time, whose life has such an end. [I have\nthus] answered to what I [promised to] say, i.e., \u201cI am going to\nteach you, O monks, the burden, the taking up of the burden, the\nlaying down of the burden, and the bearer of the burden\u201d. The\nBlessed One said this. Having said this, the Sugata, the Teacher,\nfurther said this: \u201cHaving laid down the heavy burden, one would\nnot take up another one, [for] taking up the burden is suffering,\n[while] laying down the burden is bliss. Having, due to the exhaustion\nof all fetters, eliminated all craving [and] thoroughly known all\nsubstrates [of existence], one no [longer] falls into rebirth.\u201d\n(Eltschinger 2014: 457).\n\n\nThe originality of this su\u0304tra lies in introducing the\nnotion of a burden-bearer (bha\u0304raha\u0304ra) defined as\na \u2018person\u2019 (pudgala). In the text, the term\n\u2018burden\u2019 is interpreted as desire or craving that is the\nroot cause of morally wrong action, which in turn is the cause of\nrebirth and suffering according to the Buddhist doctrine of karma. The\nperson is introduced in the original su\u0304tra as the\nbearer of moral desert.\n\nThe controversy over persons raged among Indian Buddhists for more\nthan a millennium. The question is whether the \u2018person\u2019 in\nthe su\u0304tra is to be interpreted as ultimately real, as\nPudgalava\u0304dins (Personalists) did, or, as only conventionally\nreal, as the mainstream Abhidharma Buddhists did. According to the\nAbhidharma doctrine, the only things that are ultimately real are the\nindivisible, momentary physical and mental dharmas (best understood as\ntropes; see Ganeri 2001). Everything else that can be decomposed into\nparts, physically or conceptually, is only conventionally real.\nSiderits explains the \u0100bhidharmika position thus:\n\nA statement is said to be ultimately true iff it corresponds to how\nthings are independently of the concepts one happens to employ. Such a\nstatement can neither assert nor presuppose the existence of any\ncomposite entity\u2026 . Many entities in people\u2019s folk\nontology are not ultimately real: chariots, forests, trees, pots, and\nso on. Such entities are said to be conventionally real, mere\nconceptual fictions. (2019: 314)\n\n\nDifferent schools in the Indian Buddhist tradition have different\nstrategies for making sense of the Buddha\u2019s thought and talk of\npersons. The Pudgalava\u0304dins are alone in holding that persons are\nultimately or substantially real. The dispute between the\nPudgalava\u0304dins and their opponents is not just an attempt to lay\nclaim to \u2018what the Buddha taught\u2019, but it is also\nmotivated by philosophical considerations about consistency with the\nno-self doctrine and other important Buddhist theses, for example\nimpermanence, dependent origination, and the karma theory.\nThe Pudgalava\u0304din position on persons is best placed in the\nEmergentist camp, they try to steer a middle path between Hindu\nNon-Reductionism (eternalism) and Abhidharma Buddhist Reductionism\n(annihilationism) (Ganeri, 2012; Carpenter, 2015). They regard persons\nas emergent entities not reducible to mental and psychological and\nmental atoms (dharmas), although they depend on those atoms.\nThe Abhidharma and Madhyamaka traditions hold very different views\nabout persons.\n\nAccording to the M\u0101dhyamikas, the pragmatic usefulness of\nperson-talk is important as a catechetic device for teaching the\ndoctrine to the uninitiated. The Buddha\u2019s talk about persons and\nother continuing entities in the su\u0304tras is aimed at ordinary\npeople who, due to ignorance are beset with the false view of a self.\nAs Vincent Eltschinger puts it, \u201cthese preliminary and merely\nprovisional teachings are meant to offer a transition between the\nadhesion to worldly beliefs and the intuition of universal\nemptiness\u201d (2014, 470). The Pr\u0101sa\u1e47gika\nM\u0101dhyamikas not only deny the inherent existence of persons at\nthe ultimate level but also deny the inherent existence of persons at\neven the conventional level. In doing so the Pr\u0101sa\u1e47gikas\ntake themselves to be faithful to the original teachings of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, the founder of Madhyamaka. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\ndenies both that the person is the same as the psychophysical\nconstituents to which the Buddhist Reductionists try to reduce it and\nthat it is other than those constituents in the way that the Hindu\nNon-Reductionists claim. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna warns: \u201cBeyond good\nand evil, profound and liberating, this [doctrine of emptiness] has\nnot been tasted by those who fear what is entirely groundless.\u201d\nIn contemporary terms, Madhymaka position can be likened to minimalism\n(Perrett, 2002). As Johnston argues in \u201cthe particular case of\npersonal identity, minimalism implies that any metaphysical view of\npersons which we might have is either epiphenomenal or a redundant\nbasis for our practice of making judgements about personal identity\nand organizing our practical concerns around this relation\u201d\n(Johnston 1997, 150).\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and his follower Candrak\u012brti denied that\npersons are reducible to the aggregates and that they are distinct\nfrom the aggregates. They are irrealists about selves and persons.\nAccording to Candrak\u012brti the proper explanation of this is that\nour everyday conception of self or person consists in \u2018an\nappropriative act of laying claim to the elements of the\npsycho-physical aggregate, an act that does not require there to be\nany object that is the person, nor any of the usual apparatus of\nreference to things. The term \u2018I\u2019 does not refer to selves\nor persons. In support of Candrak\u012brti\u2019s view, Ganeri notes\nthat that Reductionist accounts fail to explain the significance of\nthe distinction between the anticipation of one\u2019s own future\npain and the concern one feels for the future pain of another (2007,\n195). He further claims that irrealists are able to avoid this problem\nby substituting for a positive account of the metaphysics of persons\nan account of how one\u2019s sense of self arises from the\npsycho-physical stream. According to this irrealist account, in spite\nof appearances the function of person-talk is not to talk about\npersons, or selves, but to appropriate experiences, emotions, and\nbodies.\n\nThe \u0100bhidharmikas, on the other hand, did not think of\n\u2018person\u2019 as a useful pragmatic device or skillful means\nbut emphasized that it is nothing but a conventional designation, a\nmere name for a group of psychophysical aggregates, ultimately the\ncollections of dharmas The Abhidharma position has been classified by\nSiderits as Reductionism. Parfit claims that on the Reductionist view,\n\u201cpersons do exist. But they exist only in the way in which\nnations exist. Persons are not, as we mistakenly believe fundamental.\nThis view in this sense is more impersonal\u201d (1984, 445).\nSo-called Abhidharma Reductionism about persons was first championed\nby Mark Siderits in his classic paper \u201cBuddhist\nReductionism\u201d (1997, see also Perett 2002). More recently, this\ninterpretation has been challenged in literature. Chadha (2021) argues\nthat Vasubandhu\u2019s Abhidharma is best construed as an\nEliminativism about persons. Vasubandhu\u2019s argument against the\nPudgalav\u0101dins is based on the causal efficacy principle:\neverything that is real or substantial (dravya) is causally\nefficient, having specifiable cause-and-effect relations with other\nentities (see, for example, Gold 2015). Everything else is a\nconceptual construct, a mere convention (praj\u00f1apti),\nand thus should be rejected as only conventionally real.\nVasubandhu\u2019s uses the same principle to argue against the self\nas posited by the Hindu philosophers (in particular the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika). Selves too, according to Vasubandhu,\nare only conventionally real.\n\nWhat does Vasubandhu mean by saying that persons are only\nconventionally real? The term person is just a collective term for a\ngroup of aggregates, ultimately collection of physical and mental\ndharmas, just as milk is a term for a collection of tropes\u2014such\nas whitishness, liquidness, and potability. For Vasubandhu, only\ndharmas or tropes exist ultimately or substantially. All other things\nexist in name only. Siderits explains the idea thus: \u2018The point\nabout \u201cchariot\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d is that they are\nopaque enumerative expressions: when taken at face value they seem to\ndenote individual entities, only further analysis shows them to be\nways of referring to a plurality of entities in a certain\narrangement\u2019 (2019: 313). So, persons, chariots and pots are\nconceptual fictions. Siderits adds, \u2018The idea here is that the\nenumerative term \u201cpot\u201d represents a concept that has\nproven useful for creatures with certain interests (in this case, for\nstorage) and certain cognitive limitations (such as the inability to\ntrack all the many parts)\u2026 . Now conventional truths do\ntypically guide one to successful practice. This would be difficult to\nexplain if the truth-makers for conventionally true statements\nconsisted of nothing but mere conceptual fictions. Thus conventionally\nreal entities are said to supervene on ultimately real entities\u2019\n(2019: 314\u201315). The idea of conventional realities like persons\nbeing useful fictions was introduced in Siderits (1997) as a faithful\ninterpretation of Abhidharma. Recently, this too has been contested\n(Chadha 2021). Some conventional entities may well be useful fictions,\nfor example, chariots, armies and nations. But persons cannot be on\nthat list. Persons inherit the work of the selves, so they are just as\ndangerous as selves. The Buddhist Eliminativist about selves cannot\nand should not condone persons.\n",
