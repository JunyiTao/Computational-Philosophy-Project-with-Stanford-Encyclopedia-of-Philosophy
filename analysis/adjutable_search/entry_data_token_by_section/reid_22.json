    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Moral Judgment\n6.3 Moral Judgment\n\n\nAs with many of Reid's mature doctrines, his ethics is formed through\ncareful reflection on the theories of his predecessors, which leads\nReid to cognitivism: moral statements express propositions instead of\nexpressing feelings. When I say \u2018murder is wrong\u2019 this statement\npredicates a moral property, wrongness, of an action type, murder. In\ncontrast, sentimentalists say that when I say \u2018murder is wrong\u2019 I mean\n\u2018murder makes me feel bad\u2019 or something like that. The historical\nprovenance of cognitivism in Western philosophy, a commonsense\ninterpretation of moral language, and the existence of a God who has\ninfallible knowledge of normative truths are some of the factors that\nlead Reid to cognitivism. Because Reid takes cognitivism as supported\nby these and other factors, he does not explicitly argue for\ncognitivism.\n\n\nReid takes pains to refute arguments from Hume (and to a lesser\nextent, Smith) for non-cognitivist forms of sentimentalism. The last\nchapter of Active Powers contains Reid's clearest statements\nof his arguments against Hume's sentimentalism. Reid glosses Hume and\nSmith's theory as being that \u201cMoral Approbation or\nDisapprobation is not an Act of the Judgement, which, like all acts of\njudgment, must be true or false, it is only a certain Feeling, which,\nfrom the constitution of human nature, arises upon contemplating\ncertain characters of qualities of mind cooly and impartially\u201d\n(EAP 5.5, 301\u20132). According to Reid, moral statements are\njudgments, which are affirmations of the truth or falsity of a\nproposition. The target of Reid's attack denies that moral statements\nare judgments in this sense.\n\n\nReid's best argument against Humean non-cognitivism appears in this\npassage:\nThat every form of speech, which language affords to\nexpress our judgments, should, in all ages, and in all languages, be\nused to express what is no judgment; and that feelings, which are\neasily expressed in proper language, should as universally be\nexpressed by language altogether improper and absurd, I cannot\nbelieve; and therefore must conclude, that if language be the\nexpression of thought, men judge of...virtue and vice...by the moral\nfaculty. (EAP 5.7, 351\u20132)\n\n \nSo when one says that \u201csuch a man did well and worthily, his\nconduct is highly approvable\u201d (EAP 5.7, 673), one\npredicates of this man's action a virtuous quality. At the heart of\nthis argument is a two-fold commitment to a commonsense understanding\nof thought and language, which we have foreshadowed in earlier remarks\nabout Reid's philosophical method: sentences mean what they purport to\nmean, and persons possess self-knowledge about the meanings of the\nsentences they utter. Notice too that the evidence to which Reid\nappeals here is construed as data in support of an inductive\nconclusion about the meaning of language. When a sentence appears to\nrender a moral judgment, as does \u201cmurder is wrong,\u201d\ncommonsense implies that, ceteris paribus, it does render a moral\njudgment. Language is used to express judgments about all manners of\ntopics\u2014about velocities of objects, about historical facts,\nabout mathematical statements\u2014and in these contexts statements\nthat purport to express judgments are interpreted as statements that\nin fact express judgments. Hume's denial that statements purporting to\nexpress ethical judgments in fact express ethical judgments\ncontradicts our assertoric use of statements that purport to express\njudgments.\n\n \nHaving argued that Reid's theory resembles that of cognitivists,\nunlike other cognitivists Reid crafts extensive and important roles\nfor moral sentiments in his moral philosophy. Reid is not content with\na moral theory that has room only for reasoning and judgment, as in\nSamuel Clarke's theory. Showing his sympathies for the\nsentimentalists, he introduces the concept of moral approbation (and\ndisapprobation), which includes \u201cnot only a moral judgment of\nthe action, but some affection, favourable or unfavorable, towards the\nagent, and some feeling in ourselves\u201d (EAP 3.3.7, 180). For\nexample, when I witness someone coming to the aid of a stranger who\nhas fallen down, my moral approbation includes a praiseworthy judgment\nof the actor's character and action and is conjoined with feelings of\napproval and esteem for the actor. He says, \u201cOur moral judgments\nare not like those we form in speculative matters, dry and\nunaffecting, but, from their nature, are necessarily accompanied with\naffections and feelings\u201d (EAP 3.3.7, 180). This\ncrystallizes Reid's disagreement with Hume in the previous\nparagraph. Though moral judgments cannot be analyzed merely as the\nexpression of a sentiment, moral judgments take affective experiences\nas an ingredient.\n",
