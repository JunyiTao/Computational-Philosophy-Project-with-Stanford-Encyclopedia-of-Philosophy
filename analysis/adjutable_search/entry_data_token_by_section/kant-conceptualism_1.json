    "main_text": "The Locus of Debate: Experience, Perception, or Intuition?\n2. The Locus of Debate: Experience, Perception, or Intuition?\n\nWhen inquiring about the nature of the relationship between the\nintellect and sense experience it is important to keep in mind the\ntechnical sense with which Kant uses various terms, as introduced\nabove. There are at least two reasons for doing so. First, to be as\nclear as we can regarding Kant\u2019s understanding of his own\ntheory. Second, to avoid confusion regarding the relation between\nKant\u2019s conception of such terms and our modern Anglophone\ntradition of use. This latter issue is especially significant since it\nis not at all clear that Kant\u2019s conception of\n\u201cexperience\u201d admits of straightforward translation into\nour modern notion. For example, Kant is clear that\n\u201cexperience,\u201d in his sense of an \u201cempirical\ncognition\u201d (empirische Erkenntnis), includes conceptual\nsynthesis, since such synthesis is what binds the various elements of\nan empirical cognition together such that they are non-arbitrarily\nconnected (see, e.g., B12, B161, B201, B218, and B233). As a result,\nall should concede that his usage of \u201cexperience\u201d\n(Erfahrung) and \u201cempirical cognition\u201d\n(empirische Erkenntnis) typically is meant in a way that\nassumes a cognitive contribution in the form of conceptual synthesis\nby the understanding (Allais 2016: 4). Thus, and rather confusingly,\nif there is a debate to be had concerning Kant\u2019s view of the\nconceptual or intellectual character of \u201cexperience\u201d in\nits contemporary English sense of a kind of phenomenally conscious\nstate, it may well be located at somewhere other than the level of\n\u201cexperience\u201d in Kant\u2019s technical sense (though for\nworries about our contemporary philosophical usage of\n\u201cexperience\u201d see Byrne 2009).\n\nMore controversial is the issue of whether \u201cperception\u201d\n(Wahrnehmung) in Kant\u2019s technical sense constitutively\ninvolves concepts or otherwise depends on conceptual synthesis. There\nis at least some evidence for thinking it does. For example, Kant says\nin the second version of the Transcendental Deduction, that \u201call\nsynthesis, through which even perception itself becomes possible,\nstands under the categories\u201d (B161). It may be that Kant\u2019s\nuse of \u201cperception\u201d (Wahrnehmung) here is largely\nin line with preceding German usage (e.g., in Wolff, Baumgarten,\nMeier, and Tetens) to mean the becoming conscious of a sensory\nrepresentation in the mind (alternatively, becoming conscious of that\nwhich is presented via such representation), rather than either the\nmere occurrence of such a representation, or the occurrence of a\njudgment concerning the representation (Tolley 2016b, 2020). In this\nway perception, as empirical consciousness of a representation (or\nwhat is presented through it; B207) is intermediate between the mere\noccurrence of an intuition in a subject\u2019s mind and experience or\nempirical cognition, which Kant describes as involving judgment.\nKant\u2019s claim concerning perception in the Deduction could then\nbe read as a claim concerning how categorial synthesis is necessary\nfor empirical consciousness (perception) of the objects that are given\nto the mind in intuition, prior to making any judgment (in experience)\nconcerning those objects.\n\nHowever, Kant\u2019s position concerning perception, understood in\nterms of conscious sensory representation, is complicated by various\nremarks he makes concerning non-human animal (hereafter\n\u201canimal\u201d) consciousness. For example, in various\ndescriptions of the \u201cladder\u201d of cognition in the logic\nlectures, Kant allows that animals have representations with\nconsciousness and consciously discriminate between objects on that\nbasis. Moreover, Kant allows for such representational capacities in\nanimals even though, lacking an intellect, animals thereby fail to\nhave any capacity for cognition (at least in its narrow sense),\nunderstanding, or comprehension (J\u00e4sche Logik\n9:64\u20135; see also Dohna-Wundlacken Logik (c. 1792)\n24:730\u20131; Wiener Logik (1780) 24:846; Blomberg\nLogik (c. 1771) 24:132-3, 134\u20135, 136). Kant also says of\nanimals that they may be conscious of individual representations,\nwhile lacking any consciousness of the \u201cunity\u201d of those\nrepresentations (letter to Herz, 26 May 1789, C 11:52). Such texts\nsuggest that animals are conscious of their representations but lack\nany self-consciousness with respect to those representations\n(Paton 1936: 332\u20135; Naragon 1990; Ameriks 2000: ch. 7; Allais\n2009; McLear 2011; Tolley 2016a; Golob forthcoming). Moreover,\nKant\u2019s description of consciousness as necessary for making\ndistinctions, and as coming in degrees (B414-15), also suggests that\nanimals must be conscious of their representations to a degree\nsufficient for explaining how they make the distinctions between\nobjects in their environment that they obviously do. However,\ninterpreting these texts, and the significance of Kant\u2019s remarks\non animals, remains contested (Kemp Smith 2003: lii\u2013liv;\nGr\u00fcne 2014b: \u00a72; Fisher 2017; Land 2018; Leland 2018a,b;;\nCallanan 2020). Thus it remains contested as to whether\nperception, in Kant\u2019s sense, is possible without intellectual\ncapacities involving conceptual representation.\n\nIf there is some question whether perception is possible without an\nintellect and conceptual capacities, the issue is even more fraught\nwith respect to intuition, and this is indeed where much of the\ncontemporary discussion has focused (e.g., Sellars 1968: ch. 1;\nMcDowell 1996; Hanna 2001: ch. 4; Hanna 2005; Ginsborg 2008; Allais\n2009; Gr\u00fcne 2009; Friedman 2012; Tolley 2013; McLear 2015).\nMoreover, since intuition is the most basic object-related\nrepresentation, if Kant construes intuition as inextricably linked\nwith conceptual representation then he would clearly also be committed\nto thinking so of perception and experience. Conversely, however, if\nKant denies any intrinsic connection between intuition and\nconceptualization he is nevertheless free to argue that conceptual\ncapacities play an important role at the level of perception or\nexperience.\n\nIn what follows this entry assumes that intuition and its faculty of\nsensibility is the relevant locus of debate. It also assumes that\nKant\u2019s notion of intuition has some correlation with our\ncontemporary conception of what is described by the English term\n\u201cexperience\u201d, though this entry will largely leave the\nnature of that connection open in what follows. Given this locus of\ndiscussion, the next section examines two frameworks within which to\nthink about the dependence of intuition on conceptualization.\n",
