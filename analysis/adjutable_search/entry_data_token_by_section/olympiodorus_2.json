    "main_text": "Commentaries on Aristotle\n3. Commentaries on Aristotle\n\n\nThe Prolegomena to Aristotle\u2019s logic, or in a sense to his\nwhole philosophical work, begins again with a carefully worded\nstatement that is reminiscent of the first words of the\nAlcibiades commentary: \u201cSince we want to enjoy the\nfountain of good things, there is an eagerness in us to cling to\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy, which provides life with the principle of good\nthings, and not the least because it leads the bright mind towards\nprecision as to what is being sought.\u201d\n(Proleg. 1,3\u20136). The Prolegomena consists of\nfive lectures in which he gives his students a brief overview of the\nvarious schools of Greek philosophy and the division of the works of\nAristotle; he explains, among other things, the aim of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy (recognition of the Good \u2014 apparently the prime mover\nof the Metaphysics \u2014 as the principle of everything,\n9,14\u201330) and the moral an intellectual requirements of a student\nand of a teacher of philosophy (10,3\u201333). The various\nphilosophical thinkers and schools are being introduced without\nevaluations of their philosophical merits, and there is no talk about\nthe harmony of the philosophers in general, or between Plato and\nAristotle.\u00a0\n\n\nOlympiodorus adopts the view of Iamblichus that the subject-matter\n(skopos) of the Categories is speech\nsignifying things by the mediation of thoughts\n(Proleg. 21,101\u20133; in Cat. 28,25ff), which\nconforms with the basic interpretation of the Categories in\nthe school of Alexandria. Formally, too, the commentary resembles more\nthan his other commentaries on Aristotle do the standard format\nfamiliar from other Neoplatonic commentators on Aristotle. Unlike the\ncommentary on the Meteorology, which displays the typically\nOlympiodorean structure of being divided into praxeis which\nare then subdivided into longer expositions of the meaning of the\npassage under discussion (the\u00f4riai) and more detailed\nanalyses of the text (lexeis), the commentary on the\nCategories is simply divided into the\u00f4riai\n(which don\u2019t seem to be further subdivided).\n\n\nThe Meteorology commentary begins without any significant\nintroduction directly with Aristotle\u2019s text. It is impossible to tell\nwhether his students, at that point, had worked their way through the\n(in the order of the curriculum) prior physical treatises, notably the\nPhysics, de Caelo, and de Generatione et\nCorruptione. In any case, Olympiodorus makes no reference to\nlectures he had previously delivered on these texts; all he does is\nplace the present work into the context of the other physical\ntreatises. So he says, for example, that Aristotle wrote three\ntreatises about the elementary bodies, the de Caelo, which\nconcerns itself with them insofar as they are eternal, the de\nGeneratione, which concerns their coming to be, and the\nMeteorology, which treats them as things that are\n\u201csubject to influences\u201d (pathainomena), a very\nunusual term the precise meaning of which Olympiodorus nowhere\ndefines. The term occurs in Proclus, but in different contexts.\n\n\nThis commentary (written after 565) is of particular interest, since\nit is the only complete commentary on the Meteorology extant\nfrom antiquity. There is another commentary, written by the Christian\nJohn Philoponus some 30 years earlier, but it is incomplete (comments\nbreak off in the 12th chapter of Book I). This was, in\nfact, Philoponus\u2019 last commentary, written after the highly\ncontroversial contra Aristotelem and probably just at the\ntime when he stopped teaching philosophy. Olympiodorus must have been\nfamiliar with the gist, if not the details, of Philoponus\u2019 searing\ncriticism of Aristotle, yet he appears to be entirely unfazed by\nit. He announces early on the Aristotelian orthodoxy that there are\nfive elements, not merely four, and that the celestial element\n(aith\u00ear) is creative (poi\u00eatikos), the\nother elements material (hulikos) (in Meteor.\n2,15f). Strikingly, he happily reproduces Aristotle\u2019s argument for the\nexistence of a fifth element from the de Caelo (the\ncircularity of the celestial motion can only be explained on the\nassumption of a special celestial element, cf.  in Meteor.\n16,25\u201317,9). He polemicizes against the view that the heavens\nconsist of fire (in Meteor. 17,1\u201318,30), and in no way\nqualifies, hides, or denies the fact (scandalous to Christians) that\nAristotle thought the universe, and time, to be eternal (in\nMeteor. 8,8f;123,24f).\n\n\nOlympiodorus\u2019 main influences in this commentary stem from Alexander\nof Aphrodisias, whom he cites frequently, and the views of Ammonius,\nwhich he was intimately familiar with. But Olympiodorus never refers\nto Philoponus. There are occasional references to certain unnamed\npeople who proffered views Olympiodorus disagrees with (see e.g.,\n4,16; 7,22; 23,5.11.18.20), but it is difficult to trace these views\nback to Philoponus. The latter seems to have been of no concern to\nhim. Shockingly, perhaps, Olympiodorus simply ignores relevant and\nimportant intellectual work that was carried out in his own lifetime,\nin the same \u2018university\u2019, and even the same\n\u2018department\u2019 by a man he must have known personally. To\nOlympiodorus and his disciples, as with Simplicius in Athens, John\nPhiloponus was evidently persona non grata.\n",
