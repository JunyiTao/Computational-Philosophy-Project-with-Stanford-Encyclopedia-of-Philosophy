Statistical Mechanics Requiring Information Processing\n\n\nSzilard's own answer to the dilemma posed by his engine was to\npresume that a demon could not operate the device continuously and\nreliably. He then tried to deduce where it must go wrong. He imposed\nthe postulate that the second law must be obeyed and after eliminating\nall other sources of entropy production, he argued that a minimum\nentropy production occurs during measurement. The postulated second law\nis a modified one, requiring that the average entropy\nproduction in a measurement process must equal the average\nentropy reduction as a result of that measurement. Although Szilard did\nnot identify a specific definition of entropy, it is clear from the\ncontext that he was considering the entropy of specific macrostates.\nThe most significant aspect of Szilard's argument is, in effect, that\nif statistical mechanics is incompatible with the operation of untamed\ndemons, then it is required that there be an entropic cost\nassociated with the demon's acquisition of information.\n",
