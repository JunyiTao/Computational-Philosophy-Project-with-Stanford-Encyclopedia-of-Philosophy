    "main_text": "Four Ways of Characterizing Essentialism\n3. Four Ways of Characterizing Essentialism\n\nThere are at least four fairly standard ways of characterizing\nessentialism, and by considering two extreme views, we can easily see\nthe differences among these four characterizations. According to the\nfirst extreme view\u2014one that it is natural to call maximal\nessentialism\n\nall of any given object\u2019s properties are essential to it.\n\n\nAccording to the other extreme view\u2014one that it is natural to call\nminimal essentialism\n\nthere are virtually no limits to the ways in which any given object\nmight have been different from the way that it actually is, so that\nthe only essential properties of an object are what we might think of\nas its trivial essential properties\u2014properties like being either\n\\(F\\) or non-\\(F\\) (for any property \\(F\\)) and being\nself-identical.\n\n\nShould so-called minimal essentialism really count as a form of\nessentialism? And should so-called maximal essentialism really count\nas a form of essentialism? There are four positions in logical space\nwith respect to these questions: yes and yes; yes and no; no and yes;\nand no and no. Each of these positions is occupied by some reasonably\nprominent characterization of\n essentialism.[5]\n\nThe first position\u2014according to which both \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d and \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d count as\ngenuine forms of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the\ncharacterization of essentialism that was offered at the outset:\n\nthe doctrine that (at least some) objects have (at least some)\nessential properties.\n\n\nWe are inclined to think that this simple and straightforward\ncharacterization is the most common understanding of essentialism,\nalthough it is rarely explicitly stated. (Mackie (2006, p. 1) provides\nan example of someone who does explicitly use this\ncharacterization.)\n\nThe second position\u2014according to which \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d but not \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d counts\nas a genuine form of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the\ncharacterization that Quine (1953b/1976, pp. 175\u20136) very\nfamously offered:\n\nthe doctrine that some of the attributes of a thing (quite\nindependently of the language in which the thing is referred to, if at\nall) may be essential to the thing, and others accidental.\n\n\nIn more formal terms, essentialism, Quine (1953b/1976, p. 176) says,\nis the doctrine that there are true sentences of this form:\n\\(\\exists x(\\Box Fx \\amp Gx \\amp{\\sim}\\Box Gx)\\) (where\n\u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 may be read as \u2018it is necessary\nthat\u2019). According to \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d any\ngiven object has only essential properties. It has no accidental ones.\nThat means that according to \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d, there\nwill be no properties to \u201cgo in for\u201d the\n\u2018\\(G\\)\u2019 in Quine\u2019s sentence schema; and so,\n\u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d is no form of essentialism at all\non Quine\u2019s characterization.\n\nThe third position\u2014according to which \u201cmaximal\nessentialism\u201d but not \u201cminimal essentialism\u201d counts\nas a form of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the characterization of\nessentialism as\n\nthe view that (at least some) objects have (at least some) non-trivial\nnecessary properties.\n\n\nDella Rocca (1996a) thinks of essentialism in this way, and so counts\n\u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d but not \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d as a form of essentialism. (It is natural to\nsuppose that Della Rocca thinks that essential properties are\nnon-trivial necessary properties, so that he can say things\nlike, \u201cEssentialism is the view that some objects have some\nessential properties.\u201d If this is what Della Rocca thinks, then\non his view, either the essential/accidental distinction is not exhaustive\u2014since trivial necessary properties, like being such that there are infinitely many primes, are neither accidental nor essential\u2014or the distinction is exhaustive but being such that there are infinitely many primes is counted an accidental property, contrary to intuition.)\n\nThe fourth position\u2014according to which neither \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d nor \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d counts as a\nform of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the characterization of\nessentialism as\n\nthe view that the accidental/essential property distinction is robust\nin the sense that (at least some) objects have (at least some)\nnon-trivial essential properties and (at least some) objects have (at\nleast some) accidental properties.\n\n\nYablo (1998) has this characterization in mind, and so he\ncharacterizes both \u201cminimal essentialism\u201d and\n\u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d as forms of anti-essentialism.\n\nIn the remainder of this entry, essentialism will be understood in the\nfirst of the four ways\u2014so maximal essentialism and minimal\nessentialism will both be viewed as forms of essentialism.\n",
