    "main_text": "Connections to logic and philosophy\n4. Connections to logic and philosophy\nThere has to date been surprisingly little philosophical engagement with computational complexity theory.  Although several questions which have their origins in computability theory \u2013 e.g. the status of Church\u2019s Thesis and the significance of effectively undecidable problems \u2013 have been widely discussed, the analogous questions about the Cobham-Edmonds Thesis and the significance of effectively decidable but feasibly undecidable problems have attracted little attention amongst philosophers of mathematics. And despite ongoing interest in logical knowledge and resource bounded reasoning, fields such as epistemology, decision theory, and social choice theory have only recently begun to make use of complexity-theoretic concepts and results.  This section will attempt to bridge some of these gaps by highlighting connections between computational complexity and traditional topics in logic and philosophy.\n",
