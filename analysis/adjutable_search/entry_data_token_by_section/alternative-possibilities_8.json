    "main_text": "Arguments for PAP || The Nature of Agency\n2.3 The Nature of Agency\n\nAmong the goals of action theory is to distinguish what we do from\nwhat merely happens to us (see, e.g., Davidson 1980: ch. 3). Suppose\nthat on the best way to draw this distinction, action (agency)\nrequires alternatives. Some event in your life, that is, doesn\u2019t\ncount as something you did unless an alternative was within\nyour power. For example, when you\u2019re awakened by a noise, this\nis not an event you could have avoided, and so it was not an action,\nnot an exercise of your agency. Similarly, events such as stumbling,\nsweating, and blushing aren\u2019t things you (strictly) do: they\nhappen to you. To this list we could add mental events such as\nobsessive thoughts: when such thoughts are, in the relevant sense,\nunavoidable, they belong to the sufferer only in the sense that the\nperson is their subject, the arena in which they occur, not their\nagent. Given this view of action, PAP follows immediately: if action\nrequires alternatives, then a fortiori, action for which one\nis morally responsible requires them.\n\nThis line of defense finds a home in some versions of agent-causalism,\non which, not just free action, but action simpliciter\nrequires agent causation (Taylor 1966; Steward 2012b; Brent 2017). On\nthis picture, the difference between what I do and what merely happens\nto me is that I am the (or a) cause of the former, not the latter. Now\nadd a second, logically independent premise that agent causation\nrequires alternatives. If someone is necessitated, either internally\nor externally, it is the compelling factor, not the agent, that causes\nthe resulting event, which thus is not an action. Not all agent\ncausalists endorse both premises (Clarke 1993 and O\u2019Connor 2000\ndeny that action simpliciter requires agent causation; Taylor 1966 and\nMarkosian 2012 deny that agent causation requires alternatives). But\njoining the premises entails that action\u2014and thus morally\nresponsible action\u2014requires alternatives.\n\nThis approach to defending PAP will have to say something about\napparent actions that do not involve alternatives. When an addict\ntakes a drug due to an irresistible urge to do so, it seems this is\nsomething the addict does, even if the addict can\u2019t resist. (For\na reply to such examples, see Alvarez 2013.) Similarly, the view\nentails that if causal determinism or some other universal block of\nalternatives is in place, no one ever acts; whether this is an\nacceptable consequence is disputed (Shabo 2011; Steward 2012a).\n",
