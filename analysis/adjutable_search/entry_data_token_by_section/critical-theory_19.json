    "main_text": "Critical Theories Today || Theorizing Struggles and Movements\n4.1 Theorizing Struggles and Movements\n\nAs emphasized above, Frankfurt School critical theory is\nmethodologically interdisciplinary and defined by its aim of\ncontributing to the emancipatory transformation of society by\ncritically reflecting on the ways in which thinking itself can be\ndistorted by structures of domination. This is also true of the\nvarious forms of critical theorizing that have emerged from and in\nrelation to struggles against gendered oppression, racism, and\ncolonialism and its legacies. Indeed, those critical theories bring to\nlight structures of domination and modes of thinking (patriarchy,\nwhite supremacy, neocolonialism and Eurocentrism) that have until\nrecently been neglected by the Frankfurt School and must be taken into\naccount by any theory that aims to be critical and emancipatory.\n4.1.1 Gender\n\nMore than one feminist theorist has argued that engaging feminism has\nbeen, and still is, crucial to renewing Frankfurt School critical\ntheory both methodologically and in order to live up to its\nemancipatory aims (Fraser 1985, Ferrarese 2018). But analyzing the\nintersection between feminist theory and the Frankfurt School is\ncomplicated by the diverse array of theorists on both sides of that\nintersection. Some of the debates among feminist critical theorists\nmirror debates already discussed, for instance between those who draw\non first generation versus Habermas or those who embrace Habermasian\nversus poststructuralist critical theory.\n\nIn most accounts, the first generation of the Frankfurt School is\nportrayed as not including any women and, with the exception of\nMarcuse in the 1970s (Marcuse 1974), its main protagonists largely\nfailed to theorize about gender-based oppression or engage with\nfeminist movements or the feminist theory of their time (there is,\nhowever, a new research project at the Institute for Social Research\nin Frankfurt that aims to challenge the dominant historiography by\nhighlighting contributions of female researchers such as K\u00e4the\nWeil and Else Frenkel-Brunswik and feminist work within the Frankfurt\nSchool). While fully acknowledging why feminists might find little of\nvalue in the first generation, some feminist theorists have\nhighlighted important methodological affinities between, and potential\nfor productive engagement with, that body of work (Brown 2006, Heberle\n2006, Marasco 2006). In spite of the first generation\u2019s\nnostalgia for the authority of the patriarchal family, their studies\nof authoritarianism were groundbreaking in analyzing the family as a\npolitical institution and breeding ground for fascism (Marasco 2018).\nRecent interest in Adorno\u2019s work in particular builds on his\ntheory of the nonidentical as support for the feminist critique of\nessentialist identities as well as affinities between feminist aims\nand his deconstruction of dualisms like nature and history or reason\nand desire, and his appeal to lived experience as crucial to\nphilosophy and critique (Heberle 2006, 5\u20136). Attempts at\nsynthesis include using his theory of the nonidentical, in dialogue\nwith Lacan and Marx, to theorize a new approach to feminist political\nsubjectivity (Leeb 2017), and combining Adorno\u2019s insights into\n\u201cbourgeois coldness\u201d with the feminist ethics of care to\nrethink the fragility of our concern for others within a capitalist\nform of life that fosters \u201cgeneralized indifference\u201d while\nalso producing a gendered form of attention to others (Ferrarese\n2018).\n\nTurning to the second generation, the critique of Habermas\u2019s\nfailure to adequately theorize gender in his Theory of\nCommunicative Action (1981) was a turning point. In a now-classic\nessay, Nancy Fraser (1985) took a cue from the Marx quote about\ncritical theory reflecting on the struggles of the age to criticize\nthe Frankfurt School, and Habermas in particular, for failing to\ntheorize one of the most significant struggles against domination.\nSeyla Benhabib raised similar concerns about whether the theory of\ncommunicative action could adequately theorize the feminist movement\n(1986, 252), and in Situating the Self (1992) aimed to make\nHabermasian discourse theory more cognizant of the self as gendered\n(see also the essays collected in Meehan 1995). In his later discourse\ntheory of democracy, Habermas does engage the feminist theory and\npolitics of equality to illuminate his core thesis about how private\nand public autonomy mutually presuppose each other (1992 [1996,\n418\u2013427]). But feminist critical theorists maintain that his\nrationalist approach fails to adequately capture the way power\noperates (Allen 2008, Ch. 5; McNay 2022, Ch. 1) or to incorporate\nforms of communication like narrative that have been crucial to\nfeminism (Lara 1998, 2021; Young 2000).\n\nThe third generation of the Frankfurt School represents a crucial\nshift, with prominent feminist theorists like Fraser and Benhabib\nattempting to make critical theory more amenable to feminism from\nwithin the tradition, while also engaging in debates with leading\nfigures in the poststructuralist strand of feminist critical theory\nlike Judith Butler (Benhabib et. al. 1995). A core issue in these\ndebates has been between Habermasian feminists who stress autonomy and\npoststructuralists who stress the idea of subjection \u2013 the ways\nin which power is central to the formation of subjects and their\ndesires (Butler 1997). Amy Allen critically engages and synthesizes\ninsights from both sides of this debate in viewing subjects as both\nconstituted through relations of power and able to exercise autonomy\nin the form of critical reflection (Allen 2008). Axel Honneth, another\nkey figure in the third generation, has engaged with feminist theory\n(Honneth 2000) and the feminist movement (2011 [2014, 154\u2013176]),\nand in debates with feminist critical theorists including Fraser\n(Fraser and Honneth 2003) and Butler (Ik\u00e4heimo et al. 2021), but\nhis work has also been the subject of sustained feminist critique of\nhis conception of love, the family, and caring labor (Young 2007,\nR\u00f6ssler 2007, Wimbauer 2023).\n\nFraser has, over several decades, developed a systematic defense of\nsocialist feminism while charting various shifts in the feminist\nmovement (see the essays collected in Fraser 2013), recently making\nthe case that the contemporary crisis in care work must be understood\nas part of a larger general crisis in capitalist society (Fraser 2016,\n2022, Ch. 3). Other feminist critical theorists also argue for a\nreturn to the critique of capitalism as crucial to feminist theorizing\n(Leeb 2017). From a different perspective, Lois McNay argues that\nrecent Frankfurt School theorists, not only Honneth and Forst but also\nFraser and Jaeggi, have failed to adequately incorporate the\nexperience of gendered oppression into critical theory (McNay 2022).\nAnother set of challenges arises from the need to develop an\nintersectional analysis of power and domination while engaging with a\nbroader range of work in feminist and gender theory including queer\nand trans* theory as well as transnational and postcolonial feminism\n(Allen 2019, 537\u2013538).\n4.1.2 Race\n\nApart from the influential studies on antisemitism and fascism by the\nfirst generation, Frankfurt School theorists have until recently shown\nlittle interest in issues of race and racism despite the prominence of\nanti-racist struggles and theorizing throughout the twentieth century\nand the present. The silence is of course not total. Early analyses\npoint to prejudice toward Jews and other minority groups as an\nimportant part of the authoritarian personality and a key mechanism of\nproviding \u201cpseudo-orientation in an estranged world\u201d\n(Adorno et al. 1950, 622), diagnose a culturalist transformation of\nthe earlier biological racism at the center of fascism in post-war\nEurope that serves to maintain white supremacy (Adorno 1955,\n148\u20139), and identify the phantasmatic dimension of racism and\nits fictions of homogeneity, purity, and essential difference (Adorno\n1967a). Arguably, there are also broader methodological lessons from\nthe relational and materialist theory of antisemitism developed by\nAdorno and Horkheimer that also hold for the study of racism (even if\ntheir relation remains contested, see Catlin 2023), namely the\nrejection of psychologizing and individualizing approaches, the\ninsistence that the pathology always lies in the antisemitic or racist\nsubjects and not in their victims, and the emphasis on structural\nfactors that include the functional role of racism in the context of\nthe crisis of capitalism and democracy (see Postone 1980 for an early\nattempt to explain modern antisemitism in relation to the nature of\ncapitalism and the anti-capitalism of National Socialism).\n\nDespite these openings, there has not been any sustained engagement\nwith the phenomena of race and racism or with anti-racist struggles\nand theorizing, an eminently emancipatory form of knowledge production\nthat, from W.E.B. Du Bois and Frantz Fanon to Black feminism (Collins\n1990, 2019, Mills 2017), has been engaged in crossing the\ntheory-practice divide and articulating dominated standpoints in ways\nthat should have been of significant interest to Frankfurt School\ntheorists (Outlaw 2005; for a relatively early exception see McCarthy\n2009).\n\nThis missed opportunity is all the more astonishing as the\nintersection of class and race, of racism and capitalism has been at\nthe center of theorists that share a Marxist orientation, and even\nsome closeness to the Frankfurt School, most notably Angela Davis\n\u2013 who had studied with Marcuse in the US and with Adorno in\nFrankfurt, and, following Marcuse, insists on the need to bridge the\ngap between theory and practice and to combine the critique of racism\nas well as gender-based domination with a critique of capitalism\n(Davis 1983, 2004) \u2013 and Stuart Hall, who, building on Marxist\nand post-Marxist approaches, theorizes racism as a historically\nvariable response to crisis and as a mechanism that allows capital to\ndivide the working class (Hall 2021).\n\nIn contrast to the first generation\u2019s focus on the \u201cdark\nside\u201d of modernity, later theorists, from Habermas to Honneth,\ndeveloped a stronger commitment not only to Enlightenment values, but\nto the belief that these have been, more or less successfully,\ninstitutionalized in Western societies. As a result, their views clash\nwith a core aim of Critical Race Theory (Crenshaw et al. 1995) \u2013\nitself influenced by Marxist theories of the state and the law \u2013\nnamely, the aim of debunking the idea that the law and the state are\nneutral institutions that secure the common good and the rights of all\nas an ideology masking their character as instruments of racial (and\nclass) oppression, as evidenced by massive and persistent inequalities\nthat systematically disadvantage Blacks in the US in particular and\nracialized populations on a global scale, in various areas of life,\nfrom access to education, health, jobs, and housing to the risk of\nbecoming a victim of police violence. According to this view, the\nforms of freedom and solidarity realized in liberal-democratic\nsocieties are not just contingently accompanied by exclusions of\nracialized groups, as if these values had only been insufficiently\nrealized up to now and only need to be extended to those hitherto\nexcluded. Rather, the thesis is that these exclusions have played a\nconstitutive role in the history of these societies and their value\nsystems and continue to shape them to this day, and that radical\nemancipation would therefore require developing entirely different\nvisions of living together in freedom and solidarity (Kelley\n2002).\n\nMore recently, Nancy Fraser (2022, Ch. 2) has picked up on Black\nMarxist discussions of racial capitalism (prominently Du Bois 1935) by\narguing that capitalism provides a structural basis for racial\noppression and thus exhibits an inherent (even if historically\nvariable) tendency to racialize populations in order to more\neffectively expropriate and exploit them. Others have elaborated a\nrelational and materialist understanding of racism that builds on how\nantisemitism was theorized in the early Frankfurt School, and how\nracism was rearticulated in a culturalist register in reaction to\nanticolonial and antiracist struggles (Balibar and Wallerstein 1991,\nBojad\u017eijev 2020). What these approaches share, and what might be\na distinctive contribution of a critical theory of race and racism, is\na commitment to understanding racism as a comprehensive social\nrelation that needs to be understood in relation to broader\n(capitalist) social formations, \u201crace\u201d as an ideological\neffect rather than an unquestioned category for social analysis, and\nanti-racist struggles as a starting point for critical theorizing\nabout race \u2013 commitments that are at least partially shared with\nimportant contributions in the critical philosophy of race (Mills\n2003, Shelby 2003, Haslanger 2017b).\n4.1.3 Colonialism and Post-colonialism\n\nFor all its focus on modes of domination in modern society, Frankfurt\nSchool critical theory has largely failed to address European\ncolonialism and imperialism (Said 1993, 278) and their continuing\neffects in a world structured by massive inequalities and asymmetries\nbetween the Global North and the Global South. With a few recent\nexceptions to be discussed here, critical theorists in this tradition\nhave not engaged much with the large body of postcolonial and\ndecolonial theory, even if in recent years debates about the universal\nvalidity of human rights and cosmopolitanism, globalization and\nmultiple modernities, religious pluralism and postsecularism, have\nprovided ample occasion to go beyond still operative Eurocentric\nlimitations and become more globally relevant (Mendieta 2007, Butler\net al. 2011, Baum 2015, Ingram 2019, Kerner 2018; on some early\nFrankfurt School engagement with Chinese thought, specifically in\nBenjamin\u2019s work, see Ng 2023).\n\nThe main target of postcolonial critique is the idea of a universal\nhistory in which the central engine of progress is located in modern\nEurope while non-Europeans are viewed as always lagging behind. The\nstory has taken many forms, from narratives of progress in\nEnlightenment thinkers and their critics, such as Hegel (Buck-Morss\n2009), to nineteenth-century theories of racial hierarchy and\ntwentieth-century theories of development that have been shaped by,\nand in turn, rationalized, racism, slavery, and imperialism (McCarthy\n2009, Bhambra and Holmwood 2021). Both anticolonial struggles and\ntheorizing (in the work of Mahatma Gandhi, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire,\nFanon and others) have insisted that the history and present of\ncapitalism and of modern European and North American societies are\nconstitutively entangled with colonialism, imperialism, and their\nafterlives, and that taking their trajectory as paradigmatically\nmodern ends up representing a specific and heterogeneous trajectory\nand experience as universal and self-contained (Gr\u00fcner 2010).\nWhile some aspects of postcolonial critique can be seen as overlapping\nwith the critique of conceptions of the subject, reason, and universal\nhistory in the early Frankfurt School, the former also goes beyond the\nlatter by understanding these as the effects of specifically colonial\nforms of domination and by tracing a different genealogy of fascism\nthrough its roots in the colonialism of the nineteenth century\n(Bardawil 2018).\n\nRecent decades have seen attempts to bring postcolonial theory into\ndialogue with the Frankfurt School. From the side of decolonial\ntheory, Enrique Dussel has been one of the most prominent decolonial\nphilosophers to engage with Frankfurt School philosophers, developing\na global ethics of liberation in critical dialogue with the discourse\nethics of Apel and Habermas (Dussel 1998; see also Dusell 2011 and\nAllen and Mendieta 2021).\n\nFrom the side of Frankfurt School critical theory, postcolonial\ncritique has been taken up in a variety of ways (see also\nV\u00e1zquez-Arroyo 2018). In the same spirit of Horkheimer and\nAdorno\u2019s attempt to critique enlightenment in the name of an\nalternative conception of enlightenment, both Susan Buck-Morss (2009)\nand Thomas McCarthy (2009) attempt to salvage something of the core\nidea that is the target of their critique: \u201cuniversal\nhistory\u201d for Buck-Morss, and \u201cdevelopment\u201d for\nMcCarthy.\n\nAmy Allen (2016), on the other hand, is more decidedly critical of the\nrole of the discourse of \u201cprogress\u201d and the role of such\nconcepts in grounding normativity and shaping assumptions about\nhistorical development, modernization, and reason in the work of\nHabermas, Honneth, and Forst. She regards the latter approaches as\ndeeply Eurocentric and contrasts them with a contextualist form of\ncritique, inspired by Foucault and Adorno, that takes the form of a\ncritical history of the present that uncovers the deep entanglement\nbetween reason and domination. Calling for an even more thorough\nrevision of historical narratives, conceptual frameworks, and\nnormative criteria, Gurminder Bhambra (2021) argues that the prevalent\nunderstanding of modernity as an endogenous European achievement\nobscures the fact that colonization and slavery were integral to and\nconstitutive of the Enlightenment project of modernity in both its\nepistemic and institutional dimensions, a task for which historical\nand theoretical resources beyond Adorno and Foucault would be\nrequired. Fundamental questions about modernity, the human subject,\nand freedom also emerge from an encounter between critical theory in\nthe Frankfurt School tradition and Caribbean thought (Sealey and Davis\nforthcoming). In a similar vein, contemporary critics of the\npersistence of colonial structures point to how a denial of the\ncolonial past reaffirms a violent global color line (Mbembe 2016) that\naffects how societies treat Indigenous peoples (Coulthard 2014) and\nracialized and migrant populations (Celikates 2022).\n4.2 Diagnosing Crises\n\nDiagnosing crises, and the social contradictions that give rise to\nthem, is a hallmark of Hegelian-Marxist critical theory. Marx famously\ndiagnosed capitalism as a crisis-ridden social system, and the early\nwork of the first generation of the Frankfurt School was a response to\nthe economic, social, and political crises of their time.\nDialectic of Enlightenment (Horkheimer and Adorno 1947) can\nbe understood as addressing the crisis of reason that was experienced\nwith the rise of National Socialism, but the critique of instrumental\nreason was disconnected from more concrete crises and struggles.\nHabermas aimed to restore the link between critique and crisis\nbeginning with his 1973 book Legitimation Crisis (Benhabib\n1986, 252\u20133, Cordero 2017, Ch. 3). Writing in the context of\nstate-managed capitalism, Habermas diagnosed the distinctively\npolitical contradictions and potential for political crises\nwithin a social system that aims to steer the economy and manage\neconomic crises (a point influentially elaborated by Offe 1984).\n\nIn subsequent decades, crisis critique, along with the critique of\ncapitalism, was largely abandoned by Frankfurt School theorists (for a\nnotable exception see Postone 1993). Renewed theoretical interest has\ncoincided with rising public concern about social, political, and\neconomic systems currently in, or always seemingly on the brink of,\ncrisis, all against the backdrop of the unfolding effects of the\nongoing climate catastrophe.\n4.2.1 Economic Crises\n\nNancy Fraser was one of the first critical theorists to revive crisis\ncritique and to do so as part of a comprehensive critique of\ncapitalism that renews the link between analytical diagnosis and\ncritique (Fraser 2011, 2014; see Wellmer 2014 for a critique of the\nFrankfurt School\u2019s earlier neglect). What distinguishes\nFraser\u2019s approach is that it posits capitalism as the unifying\ncausal link among seemingly distinct crises \u2013 in relation to\ncare work, the environment, and political institutions \u2013 by\nviewing capitalism as an institutionalized social order in which the\neconomic system \u201ccannibalizes\u201d the very conditions that\nmake it possible within the spheres of social reproduction, the\nnatural environment, and the political system (Fraser 2022). Fraser\ncombines analysis of \u201cobjective\u201d social conditions \u2013\ncontradictions and crises \u2013 with an orientation toward social\nmovements by analyzing the \u201cboundary struggles\u201d that arise\nat the seams between the economic system and other domains, making the\ncase for these struggles to unite around an anti-capitalist\nagenda.\n\nIn a similar way, Rahel Jaeggi has developed a crisis-oriented theory\nof immanent critique (2014, Ch. 6) that is not limited to diagnosing\nsystemic dysfunction but includes the normative expectations and\nself-understandings of social agents (Jaeggi 2017a; see Fraser and\nJaeggi 2018), but at a more abstract theoretical level than\nFraser\u2019s immanent analysis of capitalism as a social order. Like\nFraser and Jaeggi, Albena Azmanova argues for renewed attention to the\ncritique of capitalism but is skeptical about how helpful\n\u201ccrisis\u201d talk is (2014) and maintains that radical social\nchange is possible without crisis, revolution, or utopia through a\nunited struggle against forms of precarity that are endemic to\ncontemporary capitalism (2020). More generally, the turn to economic\ncrisis dynamics has also led to a renewed interest in work \u2013 its\ngeneral significance, pathologies, and emancipatory potential (Jaeggi\n2017b, Dejours et al. 2018, Honneth 2023).\n4.2.2 Ecological Crises\n\nTurning specifically to the ecological crisis, Frankfurt School\ntheorists have only recently begun taking seriously the task of\nrethinking their approach to critical theory in the current context of\nan ongoing ecological disaster on a global scale (for an early\nexception, see Vogel 1996). Some critical theorists argue that this\nsituation calls for a new paradigm of \u201cCritical\nNaturalism\u201d (Gregoratto et al., 2022); others argue for a\nfundamental rethinking of Western conceptions of human freedom and a\nradical shift in conceptions of the ethically good life as a\nprecondition for the kind of radical social change required by the\ncurrent crisis (Cooke 2020, 2023). Fraser focuses on the role of\ncapitalism in the climate catastrophe and the need for eco-politics to\nbe anti-capitalist so that we can reassert control over, and begin to\nreinvent from the ground up, our relation to nature (Fraser 2021,\n2022; see Bernstein 2022 for a recent approach to such\nrethinking).\n\nIn rethinking our conception of nature, given the lack of serious\nattention to theorizing about nature in the second and, until quite\nrecently, third generation of the Frankfurt School, it is not\nsurprising that many critical theorists have looked more to the first\ngeneration (see the collected essays in Biro 2011), with\nAdorno\u2019s work viewed as a promising starting point for\nrethinking humans\u2019 relation to nature (Cook 2011,\nCasseg\u00e5rd 2021, Ch. 3). Cook argues that the \u201cproject of\nshowing that human history is always also natural history and that\nnon-human nature is entwined with history\u2026 informs all\nAdorno\u2019s work\u201d and that there are important affinities\nbetween his work and proponents of radical ecology (Cook 2011, 1,\n5\u20136). On the other hand, the view of nature as having a kind of\notherness that is beyond and not fully graspable by humans \u2013 a\nview expressed at times by Adorno and Horkeimer as well as Marcuse\n\u2013 has been criticized in favor of a more Hegelian-Marxist\napproach that sees \u201cnature\u201d as a product of human activity\n(Vogel 1996, 2011). Others argue for reviving critical engagement with\nMarcuse\u2019s work as a resource for addressing the ecological\ncrisis, with its combination of a critique of science and technology\n(most radically, as a call for a \u201cnew science\u201d) with the\nidea that social transformation must include a changed, aesthetic\nrelation to nature (Feenberg 2023a, 2023b). At this point, it is clear\nthat there must be more engagement between Frankfurt School theorists\nand the many \u201ccritical ecologies\u201d being developed today,\ne.g., deep ecology, eco-feminism, eco-socialism, ecological Marxism,\nenvironmental justice, indigenous and decolonial ecologies, and new\nmaterialism (on the recent dialogue between Frankfurt School theorists\nand new materialism, see Rosa et al., 2021).\n4.2.3 Political Crises\n\nFinally, Frankfurt School theorists have turned their attention to\npolitical crises and the rise of right-wing populist, authoritarian,\nand neo-fascist movements, parties, and governments (Brown, Gordon,\nand Pensky 2018, Gordon 2017, Abromeit 2016). This crisis is\nparticularly important because adequately addressing the economic and\necological crises of our time requires political solutions, which will\nbe hindered by political systems that are themselves in crisis,\nthereby contributing to a regressive dynamic (Jaeggi 2022, Forst\n2023).\n\nFrom the perspective of critical theorists, there seem to be two\naspects of the political crisis that are often missing from mainstream\nliberal accounts. The first pertains to the genesis and the causes of\nthe crisis (Brown 2019, Gambetti 2020). Against accounts that see\nauthoritarianism only in terms of a rupture with and as entirely\nforeign to liberal democracy, they argue that we need to examine the\ncontinuities and enabling conditions that allow authoritarian\ntendencies to arise from within liberal-democratic capitalist\nsocieties. Without analyzing the neoliberal restructuring of social\nrelations and the ways in which populist and authoritarian movements\nexploit electoral strategies, fragmented public spheres, and liberal\nideological frameworks such as \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d the\ncritique of and resistance to them will necessarily remain\ntruncated.\n\nThe second aspect pertains to the dynamic of authoritarianism and the\npolitical crisis it engenders. Beyond focusing on its political\ndimension (e.g. political aims and values), critical theorists have\nsought to analyze the socio-cultural, affective, and psycho-social\ndynamics of authoritarianism and its attractiveness to populations\nthat seem to have little to gain from the election of populist leaders\n(Marasco 2018, Brown 2019, McAfee 2019, Redecker 2020, Zaretsky 2022).\nThese approaches can draw on and are supported by Adorno\u2019s\nanalysis (1967a) of core features of authoritarian right-wing\npopulism. First, it is not so much actual abandonment but a feared,\nanticipated, or imagined abandonment, along with a perceived loss of\nprivileges that had come to seem natural, that are the driving force\nof the rise of a reactionary authoritarianism that then gets\nmisdescribed as a revolt of the oppressed and exploited. Second, the\nproponents of authoritarianism, following an antisemitic and/or racist\nlogic, personalize the blame for their fears and feelings of\nabandonment by projecting it onto groups they classify as alien,\nrather than attributing it to structural features of society.\n\nIn responding to all the crises discussed here \u2013 economic,\necological, and political \u2013 critical theorists must grapple with\na number of challenges. Purely at the level of theory, there is the\nquestion of whether positing unity or convergence among crises is\ndiagnostically accurate. At a practical level, it remains to be seen\nwhether a unity thesis will be politically motivating and whether a\nconvergence of social struggles is indeed on the horizon. The issue of\npractice also bears on the question of whether and to what extent the\nobjective conditions of crisis and contradiction diagnosed by critical\ntheorists actually affect people\u2019s everyday lived experience and\nbecome motivating factors for political movements (see\n Section 2.5).\n Such questions about the relation between theory and practice have\nlong been a focus of critical theorists and have recently gained\nattention in theorizing about a range of critical and political\npractices.\n4.3 Critical Practices\n\nWhile overcoming the gap between theory and practice has been a\ncentral methodological and political concern for critical theorists,\ncritics have pointed out the prominent turn away from practice to\ntheory in the first generation \u2013 accused by Luk\u00e1cs of\ntaking up residence in the \u201cGrand Hotel Abyss\u201d\n(Luk\u00e1cs 1963, 22) \u2013 and the continued marginalization of\ncritical praxis in later generations (Harcourt 2020). There are\nmultiple grounds for challenging this assessment. Frankfurt School\ntheorists had arguments all along about how to assess and relate to\nradical movements, such as the student movement of 1968 (Adorno and\nMarcuse 1969, Freyenhagen 2014, Pickford 2023), and there has always\nbeen a strand that continuously engaged with struggles and movements,\nfrom Marcuse to Negt and Kluge and Fraser. Some critical theorists\nhave focused on deliberative democracy, the public sphere, and civil\nsociety (Habermas 1962, 1992, 2021, Cohen and Arato 1992, Benhabib\n2004, Lafont 2019) as core fora for critical practice, while others\nhave argued for critical theory itself to be democratized and\nunderstood as a critical practice (Bohman 2003, Celikates 2009).\n\nStill, many of these approaches have been criticized for prioritizing\ninstitutional achievements over struggles and critical practices, and\nreform over revolution. Given the challenges outlined above (4.2), it\nis not surprising that some recent work tries to reverse this tendency\nby exploring more radical responses to such crises. These attempts\nnotably push beyond the dichotomy between reform and revolution\n\u2013 for example, by promoting non-reformist reforms that could\n\u201calter the terrain on which future struggles will be waged, thus\nexpanding the set of feasible options for future reforms\u201d\n(Fraser, in Fraser and Honneth 2003, 79) \u2013 and mine the rich\nhistory and present of radical struggles outside traditional forms of\npolitical organizing such as the party or reimagine the party in\nradical ways (Dean 2016).\n\nThe range of critical practices engaged with by critical theorists\npast and present is extensive (for an inventory, see Harcourt 2020,\nCh. 15). Frankfurt School theorists of earlier generations covered\nvarious forms of resistance, from the \u201cGreat Refusal\u201d of\nthe 1960s (Marcuse) and the potential for resistance in independent\nthinking and critical analysis in the face of universal reification\n(Adorno) to civil disobedience as a sign of a dynamic public sphere\nand civil society (Habermas 1983b, Cohen and Arato 1992, Ch. 11). More\nrecently, critical theorists within various traditions have analyzed\nforms of disobedience (direct, digital, migrant etc.) as political\npractices of contestation and struggles for democratization\n\u201cfrom below\u201d (Young 2001, Smith 2013, Scheuerman 2018,\nCelikates 2019b). Other practices of resistance that do not directly\nengage with state institutions or appeal to the broader public include\nforms of sabotage (Malm 2020), fleeing, withdrawal, or defection.\nThese turn away from what are seen as state-oriented struggles for\nvisibility, recognition, or representation (Virno 2004, Roberts 2015)\nand towards subaltern forms of sociality (Moten and Harney 2013) and\ncounter-communities that prefigure fundamental alternatives for living\ntogether (Loick 2021). Emphasizing the revolutionary dimension of\ncritical practices, theorists have drawn on the abolitionist tradition\nof struggles against slavery and colonialism, and its revitalization\nin movements like Black Lives Matter, to call for a fundamental\ncritique of racial capitalism and its entanglement with the punitive\nstate, and a correspondingly radical transformation of all social\nrelations and institutions (Davis 2005, Gilmore 2022). Critical\ntheorists have also explored political practices of assembling (Butler\n2015), occupying, striking, and reorganizing processes of social\nreproduction (Gago 2019), linking these to the need to rethink\nrevolution beyond the model of a single break or event and more as an\ninterstitial process (Redecker 2018, Saar 2020).\n\nWhether the new revolutionary subjects and struggles that emerge in\nthese critical practices will indeed converge to fundamentally\nchallenge the existing order, open up new pathways to emancipation,\nand develop emancipated \u2013 more just, democratic, and sustainable\n\u2013 modes of living together remains to be seen.\nHorkheimer\u2019s quip still holds: \u201cif the proof of the\npudding is in the eating, the eating here is still in the\nfuture\u201d (1937a [1972, 220\u20131]). Against this background,\ntheoretical explorations of critical practices \u2013 in the\nmultiplicity of their forms, terrains, and actors \u2013 can be seen\nas part of the ongoing attempt to bring theory and practice together\nwith an emancipatory orientation in light of the crises and struggles\nof the age. This approach has characterized the Frankfurt School from\nits very beginnings and has been a driving force in its continual\n(self-)transformation, making it into one of the most influential\nparadigms in social philosophy today.",
