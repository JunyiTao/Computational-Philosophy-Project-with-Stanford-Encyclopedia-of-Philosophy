    "main_text": "\n\nReligious experiences can be characterized generally as experiences\nthat seem to the person having them to be of some objective reality\nand to have some religious import. That reality can be an individual,\na state of affairs, a fact, or even an absence, depending on the\nreligious tradition the experience is a part of. A wide variety of\nkinds of experience fall under the general rubric of religious\nexperience. The concept is vague, and the multiplicity of kinds of\nexperiences that fall under it makes it difficult to capture in any\ngeneral account. Part of that vagueness comes from the term\n\u2018religion,\u2019 which is difficult to define in any way that\ndoes not either rule out institutions that clearly are religions, or\ninclude terms that can only be understood in the light of a prior\nunderstanding of what religions are. Nevertheless, we can make some\nprogress in elucidating the concept by distinguishing it from distinct\nbut related concepts.\n\nFirst, religious experience is to be distinguished from religious\nfeelings, in the same way that experience in general is to be\ndistinguished from feelings in general. A feeling of elation, for\nexample, even if it occurs in a religious context, does not count in\nitself as a religious experience, even if the subject later comes to\nthink that the feeling was caused by some objective reality of\nreligious significance. An analogy with sense experience is helpful\nhere. If a subject feels a general feeling of happiness, not on\naccount of anything in particular, and later comes to believe the\nfeeling was caused by the presence of a particular person, that fact\ndoes not transform the feeling of happiness into a perception of the\nperson. Just as a mental event, to be a perception of an object, must\nin some sense seem to be an experience of that object, a\nreligiously oriented mental event, to be a religious experience, must\nin some way seem to be an experience of a religiously\nsignificant reality. So, although religious feelings may be involved\nin many, or even most, religious experiences, they are not the same\nthing. Discussions of religious experience in terms of feelings, like\nSchleiermacher\u2019s (1998) \u201cfeeling of absolute\ndependence,\u201d or Otto\u2019s (1923) feeling of the numinous,\nwere important early contributions to theorizing about religious\nexperience, but some have since then argued (see Gellman 2001 and\nAlston 1991, for example) that religious affective states are not all\nthere is to religious experience. To account for the experiences\nqua experiences, we must go beyond subjective feelings.\n\nReligious experience is also to be distinguished from mystical\nexperience. Although there is obviously a close connection between the\ntwo, and mystical experiences are religious experiences, not all\nreligious experiences qualify as mystical. The word\n\u2018mysticism\u2019 has been understood in many different ways.\nJames (1902) took mysticism to necessarily involve ineffability, which\nwould rule out many cases commonly understood to be mystical. Alston\n(1991) adopted the term grudgingly as the best of a bad lot and gave\nit a semi-technical meaning. But in its common, non-technical sense,\nmysticism is a specific religious system or practice, deliberately\nundertaken in order to come to some realization or insight, to come to\nunity with the divine, or to experience the ultimate reality directly.\nAt the very least, religious experiences form a broader category; many\nreligious experiences, like those of Saint Paul, Arjuna, Moses,\nMuhammad, and many others come unsought, not as the result of some\ndeliberate practice undertaken to produce an experience.\n",
