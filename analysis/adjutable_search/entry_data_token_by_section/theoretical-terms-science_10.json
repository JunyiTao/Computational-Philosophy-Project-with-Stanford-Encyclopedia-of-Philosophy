    "main_text": "Formal Accounts || Direct Interpretation\n4.3 Direct Interpretation\n\nBoth the Ramsey view and the indirect interpretation semantics deviate\nfrom standard truth-conditional semantics at the level of theoretical\nterms and theoretical sentences. Such a deviation, however, was not\nfelt to be necessary by all philosophers that have worked on\ntheoretical concepts. Tuomela (1973: ch. V) defends a position that he\ncalls semantic realism and that retains standard\ntruth-conditional semantics. Hence, direct interpretation is assumed\nfor theoretical terms by Tuomela. Yet, semantic realism for\ntheoretical terms acknowledges there to be an epistemological\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms.\nTuomela\u2019s (1973: ch. I) criterion of the theory-observation\ndistinction largely coincides with Sneed\u2019s above expounded\ncriterion. Since direct interpretation of theoretical terms amounts\njust to standard realist truth conditions, there is no need for a\nfurther discussion here.\n",
