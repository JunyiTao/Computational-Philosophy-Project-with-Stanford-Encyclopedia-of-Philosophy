    "main_text": "Monisms || Many monisms\n1.1 Many monisms\n\nThere are many monisms. What they share is that they attribute\noneness. Where they differ is in what they attribute oneness to\n(the target), and how they count (the unit). So\nstrictly speaking there is only monism relative to a\ntarget and unit, where monism for target \\(t\\) counted by\nunit \\(u\\) is the view that \\(t\\) counted by \\(u\\) is\none.\n\nMonisms are correlative with pluralisms and\nnihilisms. Where the monist for target \\(t\\) counted by\nunit \\(u\\) holds that \\(t\\) counted by \\(u\\) is one,\nher pluralist counterpart holds that \\(t\\) counted by \\(u\\)\nis many, and her nihilist counterpart holds that \\(t\\) counted by\n\\(u\\) is none. Among pluralists it is sometimes useful to single\nout the dualist: the dualist for \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) holds that\n\\(t\\) counted by \\(u\\) is two\n\nTo illustrate these various doctrines for various targets and units,\nlet the target \\(t_1 =\\) concrete objects, and let the\nunit \\(u_1 =\\) highest type. To be a monist for\n\\(t_1\\) counted by \\(u_1\\) is to hold\nthat concrete objects fall under one highest type. The materialist,\nidealist, and neutral monist are all monists of this sort\n(substance monism). They all agree that concrete objects fall\nunder one highest type, disagreeing only over whether the one highest\ntype is material, mental, or something deeper.\n\nTo be a pluralist for \\(t_1\\) counted by\n\\(u_1\\) is to hold that concrete objects fall under\nmore than one highest type. The Cartesian dualist is a pluralist of\nthis sort (substance dualism). She holds that concrete\nobjects fall under two highest types: the material (with the primary\nattribute of extension), and the mental (with the primary attribute of\nthought).\n\nTo be a nihilist for \\(t_1\\) counted by\n\\(u_1\\) is to hold that concrete objects fall under no\nhighest type. The bundle theorist who is an eliminativist about\nconcrete objects is a nihilist of this sort (substance\nnihilism). She rejects the target: she thinks that there are no\nconcrete objects to\n count.[1]\n One who accepts concrete objects but rejects the relevant notion of\n\u201chighest\u201d type would also be a nihilist for\n\\(t_1\\) counted by \\(u_1\\). She rejects\nthe unit: she thinks that this is no way to count.\n\nAs a second illustration, let the target \\(t_2 =\\)\nproperties. The monist for \\(t_1\\) counted by\n\\(u_1\\) (the substance monist, e.g., the materialist)\nmight still be a pluralist for \\(t_2\\) counted by\n\\(u_1\\) (for properties counted by highest type). For\ninstance, she might hold that there are two highest types of property,\nphysical and mental, inhering in one and the same type of substance\n(property dualism). Or she might be a nihilist for\n\\(t_2\\) counted by \\(u_1\\), by being an\neliminative nominalist about properties and thereby rejecting the\ntarget. (These examples show the need to relativize monism to a\ntarget.)\n\nAs a third illustration, let the unit \\(u_2 =\\) individual token. The\nmonist for \\(t_1\\) counted by \\(u_1\\) (the substance monist, e.g., the\nmaterialist) might still be a pluralist for \\(t_1\\) counted by \\(u_2\\)\n(for concrete objects counted by tokens). For instance, she might hold\nthat there exist many concrete object tokens (existence\npluralism), while maintaining that these are all material\nobjects. Likewise the pluralist for \\(t_1\\) counted by \\(u_1\\) might\nbe a monist for \\(t_1\\) counted by \\(u_2\\). For instance, she might\nhold that there is only the one \u201cworld-person\u201d with two\nhighest types of property, physical and mental. (These examples show\nthe need to relativize monism to a unit.)\n\nMonism, along with pluralism and nihilism, must therefore be\nrelativized to both a target and a unit. The underlying reason for\nthis double relativity is that these are theses of numerical\npredication (\u2018\u2026is one/many/none\u2019), and all\nnumerical predication is doubly relative in this way: for a target\n(what is to be counted), and by a unit (how it is to be counted). This\nis one way to understand the moral of Frege\u2019s (1884: 59)\ninsight: \n\n\nWhile looking at one and the same external phenomenon, I can say with\nequal truth both \u2018It is a copse\u2019 and \u2018It is five\ntrees,\u2019 or both \u2018Here are four companies\u2019 and\n\u2018Here are 500 men.\u2019\n\n\nThe \u201cexternal phenomenon\u201d is the target, and\n\u201ccopse\u201d and \u201ctree\u201d (or \u201ccompanies\u201d\nand \u201cmen\u201d) serve as potential\n units.[2]\n",
