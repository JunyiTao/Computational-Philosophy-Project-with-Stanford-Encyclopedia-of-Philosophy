    "main_text": "\n\n\nFriedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (b. 1848, d. 1925) was a German\nmathematician, logician, and philosopher who worked at the University\nof Jena. Frege essentially reconceived the discipline of logic by\nconstructing a formal system which, in effect, constituted the first\n\u2018predicate calculus\u2019. In this formal system, Frege\ndeveloped an analysis of quantified statements and formalized the\nnotion of a \u2018proof\u2019 in terms that are still accepted\ntoday. Frege then demonstrated that one could use his system to\nresolve theoretical mathematical statements in terms of simpler\nlogical and mathematical notions. One of the axioms that Frege later\nadded to his system, in the attempt to derive significant parts of\nmathematics from logic, proved to be inconsistent. Nevertheless, his\ndefinitions (e.g., of the predecessor relation and of the\nconcept of natural number) and methods (e.g., for deriving\nthe axioms of number theory) constituted a significant advance. To\nground his views about the relationship of logic and mathematics,\nFrege conceived a comprehensive philosophy of language that many\nphilosophers still find insightful, though recent scholarship suggests\nthat Frege borrowed a significant number of elements in his philosophy\nof language from the Stoics.  Moreover, his lifelong project, of\nshowing that mathematics was reducible to logic, was not\nsuccessful. \n",
