The negative aspect is opposition to belief based on\nrevelation. The positive aspect is affirmation of a perfectly good God\nbased on observation of the natural order.\n\nShaftesbury argues against reliance on revelation in the form of\nmiracles, of scripture, and of (certain types of) enthusiastic\nexperiences.\n\nShaftesbury holds that the occurrence of miracles would contradict\nrather than support proper theological belief. The essential feature\nof the observable world on which proper theological belief is based is\nits order, the operation of myriad different systems\naccording to elegant and harmonious natural laws. But a miracle is an\noccurrence that violates that order, something defined as a\ncontradiction of natural law. As such, a miracle would undermine\nbelief in a Creator who works by \u201cjust and uniform\u201d laws\n(C 2.334). A miracle would evince not a single great and good God but\n\u201ceither the Chaos and Atoms of the Atheists,\nor the Magick and\nDaemons of the Polytheists\u201d (C\n2.335\u20136). As Theocles says in The Moralists to a\ncharacter who has made a plea for miracles:\n\n\nFor whilst you are labouring to unhinge Nature; whilst you are\nsearching Heaven and Earth for Prodigys, and studying how to\nmiraculize every thing; you bring Confusion on the World, you\nbreak its Uniformity, and destroy that admirable Simplicity of Order,\nfrom whence the One infinite and perfect\nPrinciple is known. (C 2.335)\n\n\nEven if a miracle could establish the existence of a being with\nunusual power, it would not prove that such a being had the qualities\nof perfect goodness we should rightly attribute to God.\n\n\nFor what tho innumerable Miracles from every part\nassail\u2019d the Sense, and gave the trembling Soul no respite? What\ntho the Sky shou\u2019d suddenly open, and all kinds of Prodigys\nappear, Voices be heard, or Characters read? What wou\u2019d this\nevince more than \u201cThat there were certain Powers\ncou\u2019d do all this?\u201d But\n\u201cWhat Powers; Whether\nOne, or more; Whether Superior, or\nSubaltern; Mortal, or Immortal;\nWise, or Foolish; Just, or Unjust;\nGood, or Bad\u201d: this wou\u2019d still remain a\nMystery; as wou\u2019d the true Intention, the Infallibility or\nCertainty of whatever these Powers\nasserted (C 2.334)\n\n\nBelief in beings with unusual powers is not the same thing as true\ntheism, which is belief in a perfectly good\u2014perfectly\norderly\u2014God (C 2.6).\n\nShaftesbury raises multiple objections to religious views that claim\nto be based solely on the revealed word of scripture. It is claimed\nthat those who write scripture are divinely inspired. But even if they\nare divinely inspired, they must still write in human language. And\nthe translation from divine inspiration to human language opens up\nspace for interpretation and criticism.\n\n\n\u2019Tis indeed no small Absurdity, to assert a Work or Treatise,\nwritten in human Language, to be above human\nCriticism, or Censure. For if the Art of Writing be from\nthe grammatical Rules of human Invention and Determination; if even\nthese Rules are form\u2019d on casual Practice and various Use: there\ncan be no Scripture but what must of necessity be subject to\nthe Reader\u2019s narrow Scrutiny and strict Judgment; unless a\nLanguage and Grammar, different from any of human Structure, were\ndeliver\u2019d down from Heaven, and miraculously accommodated to\nhuman Service and Capacity. (C 3.229)\n\n\nAt least as problematic for the claim to base religion entirely on\nscripture is the great diversity of texts for which claims of divine\ninspiration have been made. There have been many different versions of\nthe scriptural stories through the centuries. And human\ndecisions\u2014decisions that can be examined, explained, critiqued,\nquestioned\u2014have led to some texts being deemed canonical,\ncomplete, and perfect and others apocryphal, partial, inaccurate. As\nCarey puts Shaftesbury\u2019s point,\n\n\nHow can we establish the text itself, distinguishing the apocryphal\nfrom the canonical corpus of writings, given the range of manuscripts,\ntranscripts, copies, and textual traditions associated with different\nsects, each of which adopts an alternative version when it comes to\npower? (Carey 2006: 144)\n\n\nEven if we can all agree on one text, moreover, we must still apply it\nto our own lives in order to determine how to live according to its\nteachings. And such application once again opens up a space that can\nbe filled only by interpretation. Perhaps we will accept one\nperson\u2019s interpretation above all others, but then we are basing\nour religion on that person\u2019s judgment and not on scripture\nalone.\n\n\nIf we follow any One Translation, or\nany One Man\u2019s Commentary, what\nRule or Direction shall we have, by which to chuse that One\naright? (C 3.324)\n\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s point is not that scripture should be ignored\n(although see Stuart-Buttle 2019: 93). It is that any use anyone ever\nmakes of scripture will necessarily involve \u201chis own\nDiscernment, and Understanding\u201d\u2014either one\u2019s own\njudgment of which text to privilege and how best to interpret it, or\none\u2019s own judgment that somebody else\u2019s judgment about\nthose things is best (C 3.72). Shaftesbury maintains, as well, that\nthe best interpretations will be those that are deeply informed by\nextra-scriptural knowledge of the history, tradition, and\nlanguage\u2014\u201ccollateral Testimony of other antient Records,\nHistorians, and foreign Authors\u201d\u2014of the times in which\nscriptural texts were first composed and complied (C 3.236). To truly\nunderstand scripture, we must approach it the way we would approach\nany other ancient text. The result will be\n\n\na nicely critical Historical Faith, subject to various\nSpeculations, and a thousand different Criticisms of\nLanguages and Literature. (C 3.72)\n\n\nSuch criticism, far from undermining respect for the word of God, is\n\u201cnecessary to the Preservation and Purity of Scripture\u201d (C\n3.316).\n\nShaftesbury also opposes religion that purports to be based entirely\non direct revelation of an enthusiastic experience. Enthusiasts (or,\nrather, the kinds of enthusiasts Shaftesbury opposes; below we will\ndiscuss enthusiasm he approves of) are those who base their religious\nviews on what they claim to be their immediate spiritual experiences\nof God. Such experiences are passionate, emotional, non-rational. And\nwhile Shaftesbury does not deny that true contemplation of the divine\nhas an emotional component, he argues that we cannot determine merely\nfrom the character of a passionate experience itself whether it is the\nresult of divine inspiration or human distemper. A single individual\nin a cave can make noises that, because of echoing and darkness, cause\na group of people to feel great fear and thus give them to believe\nthey are under threat from a huge gang of monsters. Their feeling of\nfear\u2014their panic\u2014is certainly real, but that feeling does\nnot on its own constitute proof of the belief about what caused it. In\nthe same way, a group of people can experience some powerful emotion\nthat they attribute to the experience of God, but the power of the\nemotion itself is no proof of the divine cause. For\n\n\nthere are many Panicks in Mankind, besides merely that of\nFear. And thus is Religion also Panick; when Enthusiasm of\nany kind gets up. (C 1.16)\n\n\nShaftesbury thus describes enthusiastic experiences as internal\n\u201ccommotions\u201d that may be one of\n\n\nthose Delusions which come arm\u2019d with the specious Pretext of\nmoral Certainty, and Matter of Fact. (C 1.44)\n\nEnthusiasm is wonderfully powerful and\nextensive \u2026 [and] \u2026 it is a matter of nice Judgment, and\nthe hardest thing in the world to know fully and distinctly\u2026\nNor can Divine Inspiration, by its outward Marks, be easily\ndistinguish\u2019d from it. For Inspiration is a real\nfeeling of the Divine Presence, and Enthusiasm a false one.\nBut the Passion they raise is much alike. (C 1.52\u201353)\n\n\nScary noises in a dark cave can produce the same feeling of fear,\nwhether they are caused by many monsters or one trickster. The feeling\nitself does not constitute proof that the feeler\u2019s belief about\nthe cause is correct.\n",
