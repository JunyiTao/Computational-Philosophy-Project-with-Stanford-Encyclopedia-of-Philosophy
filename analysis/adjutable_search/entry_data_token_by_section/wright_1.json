    "main_text": "Wright's Philosophy of Science || Verification\n2.1 Verification\n\nWright's writings are contained in two volumes, Philosophical\nDiscussions, a collection of his articles published in American\nand British periodicals of the time, and Letters, collected\nshortly after his death by his friend James B.\n Thayer.[4]\n Two fundamental epistemological themes are prominent throughout his\nwork: 1) sense perception provides the only evidence whose authority\nall humankind acknowledges, and 2) sense experience alone can produce\nthe conviction and permanence that we believe knowledge should\nhave. The first point addresses the problem of the diversity of truth\nclaims, the second the expectation that genuine truth claims not be\nsuperseded. He said:\nAll observers not laboring under hallucinations of the\nsenses are agreed, or can be made to agree, about facts of sensible\nexperience, through evidence toward which the intellect is merely\npassive, and over which the individual will and character have no\ncontrol. Such evidence is not the only kind which produces belief;\nthough positivism maintains that it is the only kind which\nought to produce so high a degree of confidence as all minds\nhave or can be made to have through their agreements. (L\n96)\n\n\nConviction should be accompanied by consensus, and only sense\nperception can claim consensus among honest investigators. Wright often\nacknowledged there were legitimate sources of belief besides\nsense perception \u2014 faith or rational introspection for instance\n\u2014 but none of them were adequate as sources of\nknowledge. Wright did not analyze sense experience into sense\ndata, preferring to trust the holistic character of ordinary experience\nand most scientific observation. He introduced no theory of perception\nnor did he address the possible contamination of sense experience by\npreconceived notions. He rather placed the weight of conviction upon\nthe employment of verification, which he allied at different times with\nscientific method, the philosophical doctrine of induction, and Comte's\npositivism. He said that the ancients did not make more progress in\nscience because \u201cthey did not, or could not, verify their\ntheories\u201d (PD 45). Furthermore, all that really\ndistinguishes metaphysics from science in the modern era is that\nmetaphysics lacks method and \u201cwell-grounded canons of research\nand criticism\u201d (PD 366).\n\nWright, then, regarded the nature of verification as evident and\nwithout problems of interpretation. Verification was part of the\nsolution to the problems that beset theory-making and explanation,\ne.g., the competing claims about what theoretical entities exist, and\nwhat factors should militate for or against acceptance of any theory\nor cosmology. Asserting the priority of verification as the judge of\ntheory, Wright said that discussion of the origin of theories or any\nclaim for their a priori character is of no moment in\nscience, \u201cwhich maintains strict neutrality toward all\nphilosophical systems\u201d (PD 47). He said that the only\ndifference between theories and facts is that theories are more\ncomplex and less directly testable (PD 44). Unlike later\nlogical positivists, however, Wright did not hold that terms or\ndescriptions for theoretical entities were meaningless or to be\nresolved only into propositions stating their verifiable\nconsequences. The unobservables postulated by science are \u201cfor\nthe purpose of giving a material or visual basis to the phenomena and\nempirical laws of life in general\u201d (PD 164\u201365),\nand some of them will be proven to exist. In this regard, he likened\nDarwin's gemmule theory to Newton's corpuscular theory of light and\nthe molecular theory of matter. In alluding to the difficulty of\nrepresenting the extremely small size of molecules as measured by\nThomson, Wright said:\nBut there is no reason to doubt that in every such molecule\nthere are still subordinate parts and structures; or that, even in\nthese parts, a still finer order of parts and structures exists, at\nleast to the extent of assimilated growth and simple division.\nMr. Darwin supposes such growths and divisions in the vital gemmules.\n(PD 166)\n\n\nThe important thing about hypothesized unobservables is that they be\nrelated to actual phenomena in such a way as to have verifiable\nconsequences.\n\n\nEven at this, unobservables should not be specialized natures or\nforces taken to account just for certain phenomena. This was,\naccording to Wright, the problem with scholastic substantial forms\n(PD 166\u201367). His criticism of metaphysical concepts was\nthat they are empirically poor; they do not link different phenomena\nand do not generate predictions that can be verified at the level of\nthe tangible and visible. Unlike early modern critics of scholastic\nmetaphysical concepts, Wright did not claim that scientific concepts\nare by comparison clear and simple.  Indeed, theoretical entities in\nmodern science can be hard to represent to ourselves because of the\nlimitations of our conceptions to perceptible forms and properties\n(PD 166). Wright speculated that there were \u201corders of\nforces\u201d between the physico-chemical and the vital, just as\nthere are intermediate phenomena between the vegetative functions of\nan animal and sensibility, i.e., sensation and perception. But since\nsensibility presents the elements from which conceptions of size and\nmovement must come, our conceptions of forces and hidden elements are\nlimited to the sensible (PD 167). There are thus areas of\nnature we would investigate that are largely inaccessible to us\nbecause of empirical limitations. Wright did not resort to\nreductionism to bridge this gap in our knowledge. He said, \u201cCan\nsensibility and the movements governed by it be derived directly by\nchemical synthesis from the forces of inorganic elements? It is\nprobable, both from analogy and direct observation, that they\ncannot\u201d (PD 167). To determine what theoretical\nentities are real is difficult but is nevertheless the task of\nscience, which always concerns itself with \nfacts.[5]\n\n\nGiven the realist tendency of his treatment of unobservables, indirect\nverification is an important part of Wright's conception of the\nempirical basis of all knowledge. The theory of gravity, which Wright\ntakes to be proven, \u201cfails to become a fact in the proper\nsense\u201d because it can never be verified by direct and immediate\nsensory activity. Its truth must be verified indirectly. He said:\nModern science deals then no less with theories than with\nfacts, but always as much as possible with the verification of\ntheories, \u2014 if not to make them facts by simple verification\nthrough experiment and observation, at least to prove their truth by\nindirect verification (PD 45).\n\n\nWright did not elaborate upon the difference between direct and indirect\nverification in actual practice. He had much more to say about differences in\nmethod between science and philosophy. He believed that all branches of\nknowledge had to follow the method of verification belonging to\nscience. The \u201cphilosophy of method\u201d is incomplete, however,\nin that it cannot say what constitutes verification in all the\ndepartments of knowledge. Because there is no \u201ccomplete inventory\nof our primary sources of knowledge,\u201d there can be disagreement\nas to what constitutes a legitimate appeal to observation or what is a\nreal verification (PD 45). Platonists or rationalists claim\nverification for their theories because they have made an observation\nof what reason reveals to them. In fact, they have made an induction\nfrom rational introspection (PD 46). The positivists' claim,\nwhich Wright endorsed, is simply that \u201cverification by reason\nsettles nothing\u201d and that only data from sensible experience are\nreliable enough to admit ideas into the range of what is held to be\ntrue.\n\n\nWright added to this that verification means empirical judgment made\nupon deduction of consequences, not induction either from\nsense data or examination of self-consciousness (PD 47).\nNevertheless, even science that aims at a complete empiricism must\nadmit some \u201cideal or transcendental elements.\u201d In every\ncase, however, these elements must yield consequences that are\ntestable, either by themselves or in conjunction with empirically\nderived notions (PD 47). For example, from Wright's\nstandpoint, the cosmological theory that the universe is developing,\nnot just changing, might be a plausible interpretation of the data\navailable to astronomers of his day. But he thought the notion of\ndevelopment relies implicitly on the idea of an end or culmination. So\nthis \u201cdevelopment theory,\u201d which he calls\n\u201ctranscendental,\u201d must still submit to empirical test\n(PD 17, 118). He denied Kant's division of knowledge into\n\u201cdata of experience and conditions of\nexperience\u201d and so did not admit the transcendental in the sense\nof the rational a priori (L 106).\n",
