    "main_text": "Introduction || Background\n1.2 Background\nAn important part of the orientation for those new to thinking\nabout enhancement ethics is the ways in which current debates are\nshaped by the history of earlier efforts at perfecting people. At one\nlevel, perfectionist and meliorist impulses have deep roots in Western\nphilosophical and religious thinking, which both modern science and\nmedicine have inherited (Keenan 1999; Comfort 2012). Most advocates\nand critics of biomedical enhancement share these cultural\ncommitments, but have disagreeing visions of the ideal (Roduit,\nBaumann, and Heilinger 2013; Parens, 2005).  Other scholars, recalling\nthe historical imposition of hegemonic religious and political visions\nof salvation and citizenship, fear the elevation of any canonical\naccount of existing human virtues, in favor of visions that prize\npeople\u2019s capacity to shape their own ideals through reason,\nautonomy, and democratic deliberation (Sparrow, 2014; Buchanan\n2011). Others, pointing to the consequences of modern individualism\nfor the common good (Persson and Savelescu 2012), feel confident about\nbeing able to name the constellation of existing human traits that\nshould either be preserved (Kass 1997; Annas 1998; Agar, 2013) or\nenhanced (Bostrom 2003). However, almost no one in this literature\neschews the development and use of new medical tools for healing\npurposes (Kamm 2005; Kass 2003). Because of this, a first step in our\ndiscussion is to scrutinize the distinction between treatment and\nenhancement, to see if it can help demarcate where different\nmelioristic ideals diverge.\nAnother, perhaps more visible, backdrop for the enhancement ethics\nliterature is the history of the 20th century eugenics movement, which\nattempted to \u201cbreed better people\u201d and \u201cimprove the\nhuman gene pool\u201d through socially biased reproductive controls\nand inducements (Wikler 1999).  This background prompts questions\nabout the cultural authority of science and the social values it can\nperpetuate, and raises fears of slippery slopes that can lead to\negregious forms of oppression, by providing a vivid recent\ncounter-narrative to endorsements of enhancement as a way to fulfill\nour obligations to future generations (Sparrow 2011; Selgelid,\n2013). The eugenics backdrop tends to skew the burden of proof the\nother way in the debate, towards a more \u201cprecautionary\u201d\nstance that gives advocates of enhancement the burden of\ndistinguishing their proposals from old style eugenics in order to\ndefend the parts of that ideology that they share (Kitcher 1997;\nHarris, 2007; Agar 2004).\nFinally, in the historical foreground for enhancement ethics are\ncontemporary critiques of the commercialization (and homogenization) of\nbeauty through \u201caesthetic medicine\u201d (Bordo 1993), the\nevolving history of pharmaceutical performance enhancement in sports\n(Hoberman 1992), and the scientific career of human gene transfer and\n\u2018genetic engineering\u2019 (Friedman 1998). Each of these\nstories supports a literature of its own, which has contributed\nimportant insights to the broader discussion of enhancement ethics.\nFrom feminist and disability studies come critiques of the medicalization of\nhuman beauty, focusing on complicity with unjust social norms\nthat can turn ordinary welfare meliorism on its head to prioritize the\nenhancement uses of biomedicine over standard therapeutic applications\n(Silvers 1998). Meanwhile, discussions of \u201cdoping\u201d in\nsport have illuminated the ways in which enhancement interventions can\nundermine communal social practices that depend on presumptions of\nequality, lifting the discussion above the level of individual choices\nand transactions (Murray, 1987; 2009). Similarly the checkered career\nof human gene therapy has kept on the table the need to anticipate the\nphysical risks of putative improvements, and how daunting they would\nmake the foreseeable prospect of any intergenerational \u201cgerm\nline\u201d enhancement intervention (Walters and Palmer, 1997;\nKimmelman, 2009).\nAll of these contextual \u201cback-stories\u201d to the\ncontemporary enhancement debates are worth exploring further. They\nhave shaped contemporary thinking about and reactions to enhancement\nproposals and provide important cautionary tales to keep in mind when\nevaluating those proposals. At the same time, these back-stories bring\ntheir own assumptions and biases into the discussion, and can thereby\ncomplicate a fresh philosophical assessment.\n",
