Two dimensions of certainty\n\nTypically, epistemologists are concerned with the conditions under\nwhich a subject may know or be certain that p at a particular\nmoment. Interestingly, however, somewhat different issues arise for\ncertainty over time. As this was a primary concern for Descartes, who\ntells us in the First Meditation that he wants to establish something\n\u201cin the sciences that was stable and likely to last,\u201d we\ncan best see how those issues arise in the context of\nDescartes\u2019s epistemology (PW 2, p. 12).\n\nIn the Second Set of Objections, Mersenne poses the following problem:\nalthough Descartes has argued that our ability to know anything\ndepends on our first knowing that God exists and is not a deceiver, it\nseems clear that an atheist mathematician can have the same sort of\nmathematical knowledge as a theist. In response, Descartes allows that\nthe atheist does have a clear awareness (cognitio) of simple\nmathematical truths, but he denies that this clear awareness is\n\u201ctrue knowledge [scientia]\u201d (PW 2, p. 101). At\nfirst glance, it seems that Descartes draws the distinction between\ncognitio and scientia precisely so he can deny\ncertainty to the atheist mathematician. But there is good reason to\nthink that this is not what he has in mind.\n\nTo see this, notice that, if Descartes does not allow the atheist to\nbe able to acquire knowledge through clear and distinct perception, he\nwill fall into the so-called Cartesian Circle. This problem, first\nidentified by Arnauld in the Fourth Set of Objections, arises if\nDescartes holds both of the following claims: (i) I can know that my\nclear and distinct perceptions are true only if I first know that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, and (ii) I can know that a non-deceiving God\nexists only if I first know that my clear and distinct perceptions are\ntrue. Because knowing one thing is a precondition for knowing the\nother, and vice versa, I cannot know either of them. In fact,\nhowever, it does not look as though Descartes does fall into the\ncircle. Although it is pretty clear that he is committed to\n(1)\u2014in the Third Meditation, he says that, \u201cif I do not\nknow [whether there is a non-deceiving God], it seems that I can never\nbe quite certain about anything else\u201d (PW 2, p. 25)\u2014there\nis no reason to take him to be committed to (ii). Descartes is willing\nto permit the meditator to use clear and distinct perceptions before\nknowing that they are generally true. The clearest example, of course,\nis the cogito; the meditator first comes to know that he\nexists as a thinking thing and only later comes to know that his\nknowledge of the cogito is grounded in its clarity and\ndistinctness. The same, then, can be said for the meditator\u2019s\nknowledge\u2014grounded in some clearly and distinctly perceived\ncausal principles\u2014that God exists. In using those principles,\nthe meditator does not first need to have the general knowledge that\nclear and distinct perceptions are true (see Van Cleve 1979).\n\nStill, some philosophers might object that the meditator has no\nbusiness using principles that he does not know to be true. Descartes\nwould not be sympathetic to this objection. As he says in his\nconversation with Burman, so long as the meditator is using the causal\nprinciples, \u201che is actually paying attention to them. And for as\nlong as he does pay attention to them, he is certain that he is not\nbeing deceived, and he is compelled to give his assent to them\u201d\n(PW 3, p. 334; see also PW 2, pp. 25, 48; see also Cottingham 1986, p.\n67). So, the doubt that Descartes raises with respect to clear and\ndistinct perceptions does not extend to the moments at which one is\nactually enjoying them. Rather, it is a doubt that, in\ngeneral, clear and distinct perception may not be a reliable\nsource of beliefs (Kenny 1968, p. 194). When Descartes introduces the\nevil demon hypothesis in the First Meditation, it is meant to\nencapsulate his ignorance of his own origin\u2014and, in particular,\nignorance of the construction of his own mind. Without knowing that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, it is possible for the meditator that his\nmind works in such a way that it falls into error even when it is\ncontemplating the simplest questions. This doubt is chased away when\nhe actually does contemplate such a question, but it can\neasily return at a later time when his thoughts are turned elsewhere.\nThis is the sense in which the atheist mathematician\u2019s\ncognitio, or clear awareness, is imperfect. Although it is\ncertain at the time the atheist has the perception, it can always be\nrendered doubtful at another time. The theist has no\nadvantage over the atheist at the time each enjoys a clear and\ndistinct perception. Rather, the theist\u2019s advantage lies in the\nfact that, armed with the certainty that a non-deceiving God exists,\nshe will always remain free from doubt (Descartes PW 2, p.\n48; see also Kenny 1968, p. 193; Reed 2012). Consequently, she will be\nable to construct her scientific theories without ever falling prey to\nworries about whether her work has value, and\u2014perhaps even more\nimportantly\u2014she will be in a position to definitively put an end\nto theoretical disagreements with others. (The Stoics make a similar\ndistinction; see Cicero On Academic Scepticism, p. 84.)\n\nGiven this account of Descartes\u2019s epistemology, we can now see\nthat both cognitio and scientia are varieties of,\nnot only knowledge, but certainty as well. This is an important point\nto note, for it means that certainty cannot be straightforwardly\ncharacterized in terms of indubitability. For a belief known with\ncertainty to be immune to doubt\u2014not merely at a moment but\nabsolutely\u2014it must be embedded in a coherent system of beliefs,\nall of which are known with certainty (for a similar account of\nDescartes\u2019s epistemology, see Sosa 1997, though Sosa takes\ncognitio to be a lower grade of knowledge than\nscientia; also, see Loeb 1992 on the importance of stability\nfor Descartes\u2019s epistemology). Scientia, or systematic\ncertainty, represents an admirable, but probably unattainable, goal.\nIf humans are capable of certainty at all, it is surely of the sort\nthat is capable of mixing with doubts.\n",
