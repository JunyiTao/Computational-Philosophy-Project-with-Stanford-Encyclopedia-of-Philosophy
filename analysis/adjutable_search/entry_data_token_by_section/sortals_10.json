Sortals for abstract objects\n\nMost discussions of sortals focus on kinds of physical objects, but by\nthe definitions given many sortals also apply to abstract objects. And\nin some of these cases the question what is a criterion of identity\nbecomes even more difficult. We can ask how many new ideas a political\ncandidate has, how many governments Italy has had since 1950 and how\nmany books David Wiggins has written. Ideas, governments and books (in\nthe sense of type of book, not specific copies) are all abstract\nobjects. We comment on changes in corporations over time\u2014Apple\nhas grown\u2014which implies identifying Apple over time in spite of\nchanges. But we are far short of having criteria to make decisions in\nharder cases: Did Rice Institute cease to exist in 1960 or was it just\ntransformed with a new name and some changes in charter to Rice\nUniversity. The buildings, faculty and students all persisted, but did\nthe educational institution?\n\nThe question can perhaps be made more pointed if we consider sortals\nfor collections that do not imply complex structure. Corporations are\ncomplex, as are educational institutions. In contrast, a flock of\nbirds does not entail a great deal of complexity, just enough birds in\none location. We can sometimes definitively say that two flocks are\nthe same: if exactly the same birds flew over the lake this morning as\ndid yesterday then the two flocks are in fact one. And if none of the\nbirds that flew over the lake yesterday were in today\u2019s flock,\nthen they are definitively different. But suppose most but not all\nwere the same birds?\n\nMathematics also presents issues about what counts as a criterion,\neven when the definition is quite precise. Two irrational numbers\nx and y are identical if they have exactly the same\nrelations to each of the rational numbers. Pi is identical with\n3.14\u2026 because Pi is greater than 3, 3.1, 3.14, etc and less\nthan 4, 3.2, 3.15, etc. But does this count as a criterion? It appeals\nto the less than relation, which is a close cousin to identity itself\nand it involves relations to similar entities. \n\nYet another issue involves possible identification between different\nkinds of numbers. There is a natural number 2, a positive integer +2,\na rational number 2/1, a real number 2.0000\u2026 Are these the same\nnumber? Different understandings of number and different philosophies\nof mathematics offer differing answers. But these controversies seem\ninsufficient reason to deny \u201cnumber\u201d the status of a\nsortal.\n",
