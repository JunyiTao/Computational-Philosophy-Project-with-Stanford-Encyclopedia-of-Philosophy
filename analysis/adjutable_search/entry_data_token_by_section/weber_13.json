Politics and Ethics\n\nEven more explicitly ethical than his methodology, Weber\u2019s\npolitical project also discloses his entrenched preoccupation with the\nwillful resuscitation of certain character traits in modern society.\nAt the outset, it seems undeniable that Weber was a deeply liberal\npolitical thinker especially in German context which is not well known\nfor political liberalism. This means that his ultimate value as a\npolitical thinker was locked on individual freedom, that \u201cold,\ngeneral type of human ideals\u201d [Weber 1895/1994, 19]. He was also\na bourgeois liberal, and self-consciously so, in a time of\ngreat transformations that were undermining the social conditions\nnecessary to support classical liberal values and bourgeois\ninstitutions, thereby compelling liberalism to search for a\nfundamental reorientation. To that extent, he belongs to that\ngeneration of liberal political thinkers in fin-de-si\u00e8cle\nEurope who clearly perceived the general crisis of liberalism and\nsought to resolve it in their own liberal ways [Bellamy 1992,\n157\u2013216]. Weber\u2019s own way was to address the problem of\nclassical liberal characterology that was, in his view, being\nprogressively undermined by the indiscriminate bureaucratization of\nmodern society.\n",
