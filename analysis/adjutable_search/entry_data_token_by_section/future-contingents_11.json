    "main_text": "The Solutions Based on the Rejection of the Necessity of the Past || Relativist Theory\n5.5 Relativist Theory\n\nRecently John MacFarlane (2003, 2008) has suggested a new approach to\nthe problem of future contingents. Like Nuel Belnap et al.\n(2001), MacFarlane challenges the classical notion that the\ntruth-value of a statement or proposition should be determined solely\nwith respect to the context (including the moment) of utterance. He\nalso agrees with Belnap and Green in rejecting the idea of the true\nfuture (i.e., the thin red line). But unlike Belnap, MacFarlane does\nnot want to give up all talk of truth in a context. In this way\nMacFarlane accepts the same definition as Belnap, Green and Thomason\nof \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)\\), where \\(t\\) is a moment of time and \\(c\\) is a\nhistory (or a chronicle), but differs on \u201ctruth at a\nmoment\u201d or \u201ctruth at a context\u201d.\n\nAccording to MacFarlane\u2019s theory the truth of a statement should\nbe relativised to both a context of utterance and a context of\nassessment. The context of utterance is the context in which the\nspeech act is made. The context of assessment is the context in which\nwe assess the speech act. According to the theory, a statement \\(S\\)\nis true as used in the context \\(C\\) and assessed in the context\n\\(C'\\), if and only if \\(S\\) is true at \\(m\\) for every chronicle\n\\(c\\) passing through \\(m\\) and \\(m'\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(m'\\) are\nmoments within the contexts \\(C\\) and \\(C'\\) with \\(m \\le m'\\). This\nmeans that a statement like \u201cit will be sunny tomorrow\u201d is\ntrue as uttered yesterday and assessed from today, given that it is in\nfact sunny today. But it will not be true assessed from yesterday,\ngiven that it was not settled yesterday that today would be sunny.\n\nIt turns out that MacFarlane\u2019s theory implies an acceptance of\nthe principle of future excluded middle, (P5), and a rejection of the\nprinciple of the necessity of the past, (P3). An advocate of the\ntheory (i.e., a relativist) will clearly also agree with\nsupervaluationism in allowing for truth-value gaps. However, in\naddition a relativist will accept the view that future contingents can\nbe true as assessed from a future context. For criticism of\nMacFarlane\u2019s position see Heck 2006.\n",
