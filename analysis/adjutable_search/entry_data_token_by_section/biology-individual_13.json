Regulating Evolutionary Individuals\n\nIt was noted at the outset that organism and biological\nindividual have been simply equated by several influential\ncontemporary authors (Queller & Strassmann 2009; Clarke 2012).\nThis section explores their views of the regulation of evolutionary\nindividuals. \n\nDavid Queller and Joan Strassmann have provided one agenda for the\nempirical study of what they call \u201cthe evolution of\norganismality\u201d (Queller & Strassmann 2009, 2016; Strassmann\n& Queller 2010). They begin from the claim that the definitive\nfeature of organisms is the combination of high cooperation and low\nconflict between their parts (see also Folse & Roughgarden 2010 on\norganisms). Queller and Strassmann note both that these things are\nmatters of degree and that one can vary independently of the other.\nThey use these parameters to define a two-dimensional space that\nrepresents a variety of biological individuals, as\n Figure 7\n illustrates.\n\n\n\n\n7a: Groups of cells\n\n\n\n\n7b: Groups of multi-cellular\nindividuals\n\n\nFigure 7: Varying Degrees of Conflict\nand Cooperation (From Fig. 1 & 2, Queller & Strassmann 2009).\n[An\n extended description of figure 7 (a and b)\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nTo capture these ideas, it is useful to think of the feature that\nQueller and Strassmann believe is definitive of biological individuals\nas the internal ratio: it is the ratio of the level of\ncooperation between internal parts of individuals to that of the\nconflict between them. The higher this ratio is, the higher the degree\nof individuality. Figure 7a indicates that, relative to other groups\nof cells, a mouse will have a relatively large internal ratio, while a\nyeast floc will have a relatively small internal ratio. \n\nSince the internal ratio considers only the level of internal control\nwithin a biological individual, focusing on it alone neglects the\nother aspect of autonomous agency that arose in\n section 6.3:\n freedom from external influence. This external dimension to\nindividuality can also be thought of as involving a ratio between\ncooperation and conflict\u2014not between the parts of the individual\nbut between that individual and other individuals that it interacts\nwith. Just as an individual with a relatively large internal ratio has\na higher level of individuality, according to Queller and Strassmann,\nso too would an individual with a low external ratio, i.e.,\none in which external cooperation was low and external conflict was\nhigh. To extend Queller and Strassmann\u2019s idea along these lines,\nthe measure of the level of individuality would be a type of meta\nratio: the ratio between the internal and external ratios. \n\nThis extension of Queller and Strassmann\u2019s view of individuality\nmay prove useful in fleshing out more details of what Godfrey-Smith\n(borrowing a term of Huxley\u2019s) calls the movement of\nindividuality (2013: 33). This refers to the ways in which new\nkinds of individual evolve slowly, over geological time scales, from\nrecurring collaborations between different types of Darwinian\nindividuals. Such partnerships sometimes lead to new examples of\nparadigm individuals, but other times falter or stall at the mere\ncollaboration stage with no new individuals at all. Closure of a\npathway to a higher degree of individuality could be brought about by\neither a drop in the internal ratio (reduced individuality because of\ninternal matters) or a rise in the external ratio (reduced individuality\nbecause of external matters).\n\nIn effect, Queller and Strassmann have proposed a view of evolutionary\nindividuals that is exclusively focused on the regulation of the parts\nof an evolutionary individual as a means to avoiding subversion from\nwithin. In a series of papers, Ellen Clarke has developed a more\nintegrative view of evolutionary individuals that develops this\nregulative dimension to biological individuality (Clarke 2010, 2012,\n2013, 2016a, 2016b). In work focused on plant individuality, Clarke\nemphasizes the mechanisms that constrain either sources of\nheritable variation, such as niche construction, bottlenecks, and\npolyploidy, or fitness differences, such as investment in root\nconnections and the synchronization of flowering (2012: 351, 356).\nClarke then argues that something is an evolutionary individual if and\nonly if it possesses what she calls policing and\ndemarcating mechanisms (2013: 427). \n\nA policing mechanism \u201cis any mechanism that inhibits the\ncapacity of an object to undergo within-object selection\u201d\n(Clarke 2013: 421), typically by decreasing the genetic variation\nbetween parts of an object. This decreases the chance that\nthe object\u2019s parts will undergo selection that disrupts the\nintegration of those parts. There is a sense in which demarcating\nmechanisms operate in just the opposite way. Rather than working to\nconstrain or limit selective processes amongst an individual\u2019s\nparts, a demarcating mechanism \u201cincreases or maintains the\ncapacity of an object to undergo between-object selection\u201d\n(2013: 424), doing so by promoting the variation (between objects)\nthat fuels selection.\n\nFor Clarke, it is what these two sorts of mechanisms do that\nis important, not how the mechanisms do this in various ways\n(Clarke 2013: 429). In other words, it is only the functions\nof the mechanisms that Clarke thinks are definitive, not the various\nmaterial ways those functions are realized. As Clarke\nstresses, this implies the multiple realizability of evolutionary\nindividuals. This \u201cthoroughgoing functionalism about\nindividuality\u201d (Sterner 2015: 610) abstracts away from specific\nrealizations of the functional roles of policing and demarcation. In\nthis respect, Clarke\u2019s view contrasts with many other views of\nevolutionary individuals that emphasize the importance of particular\nways in which these mechanisms are realized. For example, Dawkins,\nMaynard-Smith, and Bonner imply that certain material\nbottlenecks\u2014narrowings between generations exemplified by our\nown single-celled, zygotic bottleneck\u2014are essential ways for\npolicing to be realized in evolutionary individuals (Clarke 2013:\n418\u2013419), while Ratcliffe and Kirk instead make material\ngerm-soma separation essential (Clarke 2013: 420).\n\nClarke\u2019s functionalism thus leads her to reject \u201cthe\nbottleneck condition\u201d as strictly necessary for evolutionary\nindividuality, a condition that Marc Ereshefsky and Makmiller Pedroso\nalso reject as part of their defense of the view that multispecies\nbiofilms are evolutionary individuals (Ereshefsky &\nPedroso 2013, 2015). Clarke\u2019s functionalism thus in principle\nfacilitates the search for alternative mechanisms\u2014perhaps such\nas lateral gene transfer in the case of biofilms\u2014that serve that\nfunction in contexts where the usual material bottlenecks are not\npresent. \n\nThis makes all the more interesting Clarke\u2019s own disagreement\nwith those who have defended the idea that biofilms are evolutionary\nindividuals (Clarke 2016a), wherein she argues that many of the\nimportant claims that underpin ascriptions of multicellularity to\nbiofilms\u2014such as that they are physiologically unified systems\nor contain cells that interact synergistically\u2014are either not\nverifiable (e.g., they have higher-level adaptions) or are false\n(e.g., they display heritable variation in fitness). While\nClarke\u2019s functionalism means that she remains open to the\nsuggestion that there may be some non-genetic form of heritability in\nbiofilms (Doolittle 2013), she takes the relevant empirical evidence\nhere to be indecisive (Clarke 2016a: 202).\n",
