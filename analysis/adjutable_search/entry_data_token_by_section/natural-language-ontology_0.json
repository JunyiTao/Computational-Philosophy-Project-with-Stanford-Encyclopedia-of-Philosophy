    "main_text": "Natural Language Ontology as An Emerging Discipline and Practice || Natural Language Ontology as a Discipline\n1.1 Natural Language Ontology as a Discipline\n\nThe subject matter of natural language ontology is the ontology\nimplicit in natural language, which is to be distinguished from the\nontologies of the various metaphysical theories or na\u00efve\nphilosophical views formulated by using natural language. Natural\nlanguage ontology has as its task to uncover the ontology that is\nreflected in relevant sorts of linguistic intuitions, setting aside\nthe question whether that ontology is real or merely apparent.\n\nThis entry uses \u201cnatural language ontology\u201d as the term\nfor the discipline and \u201cthe ontology of natural language\u201d\nas a term for its subject matter. The more accurate term for the\nsubject matter of natural language ontology would actually be\n\u201cthe ontologies of natural languages\u201d, since natural\nlanguages may, in principle, reflect different ontologies and even the\nsame language (or idiolect) might reflect different ontologies. For\nmost of the entry, this is simplified by talking about the\nontology of natural language, addressing the issue of different\nontologies only in\n Section 4.\n This is justified by the fact that philosophers practicing natural\nlanguage ontology generally presuppose that there is a single ontology\nshared by natural languages, as do, to a great extent at least,\nsemanticists.\n\nNatural language ontology had been suggested as a discipline first by\nBach (1986), who uses the term \u201cnatural language\nmetaphysics\u201d. That term is in a sense more adequate than\n\u201cnatural language ontology\u201d: ontology is often taken to be\nnarrower than metaphysics, dealing just with what there is (the\ninventory of things) rather than, as metaphysics does, with the nature\nof things (Quine 1948). However, \u201contology\u201d is\nincreasingly used in the broader sense of metaphysics as well,\nespecially when it has an empirical or applied dimension (e.g.,\n\u201capplied ontology\u201d, a field of study that involves the\npractical application of ontological notions and theories to specific\ndomains, such as management, biomedicine, or geography), a usage this\nentry will adopt as well. Also the count noun \u201contology\u201d\nis better usable than \u201cmetaphysics\u201d to denote the subject\nmatter of a branch of metaphysics since it comes with a plural,\nallowing talk about \u201cthe ontologies of natural languages\u201d\nand \u201cdifferent ontologies\u201d being the subject matter of\ndifferent branches of metaphysics.\n\nThe ontology (or metaphysics) of natural language needs to be\ndistinguished from the ontology of linguistic entities, words,\nmeanings, phonemes, etc. Sometimes the term \u201cmetaphysics of\nnatural language\u201d is used for the study of the latter (Postal\n2018).\n\nBach (1986) conceives of natural language metaphysics somewhat\ndifferently than the present entry in that for him it is just part of\nlinguistics, not of philosophy. For Bach, whereas proper metaphysics\nis concerned with the question \u201cwhat sort of things are\nthere?\u201d, natural language metaphysics is concerned with the\nquestion \u201cwhat sort of things do people talk as if there\nwere?\u201d Bach goes on saying \n\n\nIs there Natural Language Metaphysics? How could there not? [\u2026]\nDo the overt and covert distinctions that correspond to natural\nlanguage categories correspond to the structure of the world? How\ncould they not? But this is where linguistics stops. (1986: 593) \n\n\nBach then adopts agnosticism as to the ontological and cognitive\nstatus of the entities that are posited as semantic values. The view\nthat natural language metaphysics is part only of linguistics has also\nbeen adopted by Fiorin & Delfitto (2020: chap. 14), who\ncharacterize it as \n\n\nthe practice of identifying and studying the qualitative differences\nbetween the objects in the model that are relevant to the\ninterpretation of natural languages, (2020: 117) \n\n\nwhereby a model is strictly motivated by linguistic data.\n",
