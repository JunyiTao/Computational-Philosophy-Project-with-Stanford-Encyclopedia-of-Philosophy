    "main_text": "Disability, Recognition, and Redistribution\n1. Disability, Recognition, and Redistribution\n\nIt is clear that people with disabilities have long been treated as\nmoral and social inferiors, at the same time that they have suffered\ndistributive injustices of various kinds (see generally, Barclay\n2018). Routinely, people with disabilities have been denied jobs for\nwhich they are highly qualified because they have been considered\nincompetent, or because employers have not been comfortable with their\npresence in the workplace. Often, people with certain disabilities\nhave been consigned to segregated institutions and facilities because\nthey have been regarded as incapable of making decisions or caring for\nthemselves, or because others in the community did not want to\ninteract with them.\n\nThese forms of relational injustice are associated with very concrete\nmaterial inequalities. In 2009, almost 20 years after the passage of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the employment-population ratio\nof people with disabilities in the United States was 19.2%, compared\nto 64.5% for persons without a disability (Bureau of Labor Statistics\n2010). Based on data from 1996\u20131999, researchers estimate that\n47.4% of working-age adults who experienced poverty for a year or more\nhad at least one disability (Fremstad 2009).\n\nFacts such as these have led some to conclude that \n\n\nin particular, internally diverse ways, people with disabilities have\nbeen on the end of a kind of pincer movement between Fraser\u2019s\ntwo impediments to parity: \u201cmisrecognition\u201d and\n\u201cmaldistribution\u201d (Calder 2010: 62).\n\n\nIn these respects, people with disabilities are in a comparable\nposition to members of other \u201cdiscrete and insular\nminorities\u201d with a history of being subject to both distributive\nand relational injustice. But there is a significant difference.\nSimply put, there is no reason to think that it need be particularly\nexpensive to eliminate disrespect and misrecognition towards\nracial, ethnic, and sexual minorities. But insofar as accommodation\nand reconstruction of the built environment are necessary to eliminate\ndisrespect and misrecognition towards people with disabilities,\nrelational justice for people with disabilities may require diverting\nsignificant resources from other causes. In that sense, achieving\njustice for people with disabilities requires us to directly address\nthe relationship between relational justice and distributive justice\nto a degree that achieving justice for members of other groups\ngenerally does not. \n\nTo be sure, the costs associated with accommodation and reconstruction\nof the built environment need not be understood as\ncompensation for the alleged deficits of people with\ndisabilities. Indeed, they would have to be acknowledged even if\ndisabilities were seen as intrinsically neutral physical or mental\ncharacteristics that merely differ from those of a majority of the\npopulation. In any society whose physical structures and social\npractices are designed for average or typical members, people with\ndisabilities will be disadvantaged just because of their minority\nstatus. A similar point has been made by feminist scholars, who have\npointed out the structural discrimination of workplaces and public\nsettings designed exclusively for men. The expenses of additional\nrestrooms, stalls, or pumping stations do not compensate women for\ntheir deficiencies. They simply accommodate differences ignored in a\nsociety that saw a woman\u2019s place as in the home (Wendell 1996;\nWasserman 1998: 178\u2013179).\n\nStill, the rectification of such structural discrimination may raise\nmore difficult issues for people with disabilities than for women,\nbecause there is greater uncertainty and potential for disagreement\nabout the extent of the changes that are required to treat people with\ndisabilities as social and political equals. Indeed, the range and\nvariety of physical and mental differences within a society raise\nissues of distributive justice that have no obvious analogue for other\nstigmatized groups. A \u201cgender-neutral\u201d environment can be\nreadily conceived, and achieved at modest cost. In contrast,\ndisability scholars and activists have not specified what it would\nmean to achieve an \u201cability-neutral\u201d environment\u2014one\nthat was no more advantageous to people with some physical and mental\ncharacteristics than others. And some argued that the ideas of an\n\u201cability-neutral\u201d environment is either conceptually\nincoherent or prohibitively expensive (Barclay 2011, 2018). Moreover,\nit seems likely that questions about the extent to which justice\nrequires reconstructing or modifying the built environment would arise\nwith respect to people with disabilities even in a society with no\nhistory of invidious attitudes or practices toward such persons. By\ncontrast, it seems less likely that such questions would arise in a\nsociety with no history of sexism, for example.\n\nJustice for people with disabilities, then, appears to raise questions\nabout the relationship between distributive justice and relational\njustice that justice for other stigmatized groups does not. Yet the\nneed for redistribution hardly reduces the importance of recognition\nin achieving justice. Indeed, the complex, disputed relationship\nbetween the two makes disability a significant challenge for theories\nof justice.\n",
