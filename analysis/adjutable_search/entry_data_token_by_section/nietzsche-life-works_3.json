Later-Period Writings: 1883\u20131887\n\nThus Spoke Zarathustra, A Book for All and None (Also\nSprach Zarathustra, Ein Buch f\u00fcr Alle und Keinen,\n1883\u201385), is one of Nietzsche\u2019s most famous works, and\nNietzsche regarded it as among his most significant. It is a manifesto\nof personal self-overcoming, and a guidebook for others towards the\nsame revitalizing end. Thirty years after its initial publication,\n150,000 copies of the work were printed by the German government and\nissued during WWI as inspirational reading to the young soldiers,\nalong with the Bible. Though Thus Spoke Zarathustra is\nantagonistic to the Judeo-Christian world-view, its poetic and\nprophetic style relies upon many, often inverted, Old and New\nTestament allusions. Nietzsche also filled the work with nature\nmetaphors, almost in the spirit of pre-Socratic naturalist philosophy,\nwhich invoke animals, earth, air, fire, water, celestial bodies,\nplants, all in the service of describing the spiritual development of\nZarathustra, a solitary, reflective, exceedingly strong-willed,\nsage-like, laughing and dancing voice of heroic self-mastery who,\naccompanied by a proud, sharp-eyed eagle and a wise snake, envisions a\nmode of psychologically healthier being beyond the common human\ncondition. Nietzsche refers to this higher mode of being as\n\u201csuperhuman\u201d (\u00fcbermenschlich), and\nassociates the doctrine of eternal recurrence\u2014a doctrine for\nonly the healthiest who can love life in its entirety\u2014with this\nspiritual standpoint, in relation to which all-too-often downhearted,\nall-too-commonly-human attitudes stand as a mere bridge to be crossed\nand overcome.\n\nWithin Nietzsche\u2019s corpus, Thus Spoke Zarathustra has a\ncontroversial place, owing mainly to its peculiar literary style.\nNietzsche speaks in parables and short narratives populated by\nfictional characters\u2014\u201cthe hunchback,\u201d \u201cthe\nugliest man,\u201d \u201cthe soothsayer,\u201d \u201cthe\nsaint,\u201d \u201cthe tightrope walker,\u201d \u201cthe\njester,\u201d and \u201cthe Last Man,\u201d to name a\nfew\u2014leaving their philosophical import open to a variety of\ninterpretations. One of Nietzsche\u2019s most well-known and morally\ntroubling figures\u2014the superhuman\u2014also appears\nsubstantially only in this work, rendering it questionable to some\ninterpreters whether this ideal of supreme human health is central to\nNietzsche\u2019s thought as a whole. There is also some interpretive\nuncertainty about whether the work, which was written across the span\nof three years, properly ends triumphantly at the conclusion of the\nThird Part, thus situating the psychologically complex Fourth Part as\na question-raising supplement, or whether the book\u2019s narrative\nmoves smoothly and progressively across the entire four parts.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil, Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future\n(Jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se. Vorspiel einer Philosophie der\nZukunft, 1886) is arguably a rethinking of Human,\nAll-too-Human, since their respective tables of contents and\nsequence of themes loosely correspond to one another. In Beyond\nGood and Evil, Nietzsche identifies imagination, self-assertion,\ndanger, originality and the \u201ccreation of values\u201d as\nqualities of genuine philosophers, as opposed to mere scholars engaged\nin positive research in the sciences and humanities, or the dusty\nclassification of philosophical outlooks. Nietzsche takes aim at some\nof the world\u2019s great philosophers, who ground their outlooks\nwholeheartedly upon concepts such as \u201cself-consciousness,\u201d\n\u201cfree will,\u201d and \u201ceither/or\u201d bipolar\nthinking.\n\nNietzsche alternatively philosophizes from the perspective of life\nlocated beyond good and evil, and challenges the entrenched moral idea\nthat exploitation, domination, injury to the weak, destruction and\nappropriation are universally objectionable behaviors. Above all, he\nbelieves that living things aim to discharge their strength and\nexpress their \u201cwill to power\u201d\u2014a pouring-out of\nexpansive energy as if one were like a perpetually-shining sun that,\nquite naturally, can entail danger, pain, lies, deception and masks.\nHere, \u201cwill\u201d is not an inner emptiness, lack, feeling of\ndeficiency, or constant drive for satisfaction, but is a fountain of\nconstantly-swelling energy, life, and power.\n\nAs he views things from the perspective of life, Nietzsche further\ndenies that there is a universal morality applicable indiscriminately\nto all human beings, and instead designates a series of moralities in\nan order of rank that ascends from the plebeian to the noble: some\nmoralities are more suitable for subordinate roles; some are more\nappropriate for dominating and leading social roles. What counts as a\npreferable and legitimate action depends upon the kind of person one\nis. The deciding factor is whether one is weaker, sicker and on the\ndecline, or whether one is healthier, more powerful and overflowing\nwith life.\n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals, A Polemic (Zur Genealogie der\nMoral, Eine Streitschrift, 1887) is composed of three sustained\nessays that advance the critique of Christianity expressed in\nBeyond Good and Evil. The first essay continues the\ndiscussion of master morality versus servant morality, and maintains\nthat the traditional ideals set forth as holy and morally good within\nChristian morality are products of self-deception, since they were\nforged in the bad air of revenge, resentment, hatred, impotence, and\ncowardice. In this essay, as well as the next, Nietzsche\u2019s\ncontroversial references to the \u201cblond beast\u201d in\nconnection with master morality also appear. In the second essay,\nNietzsche continues with an account of how feelings of guilt, or the\n\u201cbad conscience,\u201d arise merely as a consequence of an\nunhealthy Christian morality that turns an evil eye towards our\nnatural inclinations. He also discusses how punishment, conceived as\nthe infliction of pain upon someone in proportion to their offense, is\nlikely to have been grounded in the contractual economic relationship\nbetween creditor and debtor, i.e., in business relationships. In the\nthird essay, Nietzsche focusses upon the truth-oriented ascetic ideals\nthat underlie and inform prevailing styles of art, religion and\nphilosophy, and he offers a particularly scathing critique of the\npriesthood: the priests are allegedly a group of weak people who\nshepherd even weaker people as a way to experience power for\nthemselves. The third essay also contains one of Nietzsche\u2019s\nclearest expressions of \u201cperspectivism\u201d (section\n12)\u2014the idea that there is no absolute, \u201cGod\u2019s\neye\u201d standpoint from which one can survey everything that\nis.\n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals is Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201cpolemic,\u201d i.e., attack, against the assumptions and\nmethods (which, incidentally, are still popular) characteristic of\nworks such as Paul R\u00e9e\u2019s The Origin of the Moral\nSensations (1877). Inspired by utilitarianism and Darwinism,\nR\u00e9e offers a naturalistic account of our moral values,\nespecially altruism, but by Nietzsche\u2019s lights, does not\nquestion the value of the moral values themselves. In the\nGenealogy, Nietzsche offers a competing account of the origin\nof moral values, aiming to reveal their life-negating foundations and\nfunctions.\n\nNietzsche ultimately advocates valuations that issue from a\nself-confident, self-reinforcing, self-governing, creative and\ncommanding attitude, as opposed to those that issue from reactive\nattitudes that determine values more mechanically and subordinatingly\nto those who are inherently more powerful. For Nietzsche, those who\nprefer to think in terms of \u201cgood vs. bad\u201d exemplify the\nformer, leading and superior mentality, and those who think in terms\nof \u201cgood vs. evil,\u201d exemplify the latter, inferior and\nsubservient mentality. From the standpoint of a leader, in the\nappropriate circumstances it is good to be able to inflict pain and\ninstil fear among those who are led, and bad not to be able to do so.\nFrom the standpoint of those who are led, the infliction of pain and\ninstillation of fear upon subordinates does not appear typically to be\ngood at all, but rather evil.\n",
