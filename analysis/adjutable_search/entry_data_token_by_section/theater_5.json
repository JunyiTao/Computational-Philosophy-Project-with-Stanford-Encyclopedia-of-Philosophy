    "main_text": "Understanding a Theatrical Performance || Recognizing an Instance\n3.1 Recognizing an Instance\n\nIf, as historically has been claimed, there is nothing more to\ntheatrical performances than illustrations of a text (Spingarn 1911\n[1931]), then there might be a quick way to answer the question,\n\u201cHow does a spectator recognize an instance of theater?\u201d:\nto encounter an instance of theater is nothing more than to encounter\na dramatic text. But, even so, you must still figure out precisely\nwhat sort of illustration of a text a live performance is\n(Worthen 2007). If one takes the view that one should think of a\ntheatrical performance as something to be described, interpreted, and\nevaluated on its own terms, there is much more to do (Hamilton\n2007).\n\nThis may seem obvious: one encounters an instance of theatrical\nperformance by means of the senses and by their typical operation,\nleading to a recognition of the social form, assuming there is a\nsocial form of sufficient familiarity. But, even when everything in a\nspectator\u2019s repertoire of sensory apparati and social\nnous is functioning normally, there is a problem with any\nspectator\u2019s ability to discern genuinely theatrical behavior\nfrom the non-theatrical.\n\nOne source of this problem is the phenomenon sometimes called\n\u201cthe theatricality of everyday life\u201d. Suppose human beings\npresent themselves in everyday life and that they do so in\nthe same ways that actors do. How then could anyone tell if/when\nsomeone else is acting or not (Goffman 1959)? The easy answer to this\nhas to do with framing effects. A person is acting only if they are\nperforming for an audience on stage (Thom 1992). That is, they act\nonly if they are within a socially agreed upon frame. And, indeed this\nis the answer that Erving Goffman gives to his own question.\n\nThis problem also arises from considering the differences between\nartistic performance and performance art (see\n \u00a72.2\n above). No\u00ebl Carroll has argued there is no definition of\n\u201cperformance\u201d in terms of necessary and sufficient\nconditions, but only coincidental histories. In the 1960s, theater\nperformers became dissatisfied with the forms and institutions of\ntheater and found they could express those dissatisfactions more\nreadily in the context of gallery spaces in which they were allowed\nthe freedom to carry out theatrical experimentation. At the same time,\nartists became dissatisfied with the forms and institutions of the\n\u201cartworld\u201d\u2014museums and galleries\u2014and found\nthey could express those dissatisfactions in the form of performances\nthat\u2014coincidentally\u2014looked a lot like theatrical\nperformance (Carroll 1986a). But if this is the case, how can anyone\ntell whether one has encountered a case of what Carroll called\n\u201cartistic performance\u201d or of what he and many others have\ncalled \u201cperformance art\u201d? The natural answer is historical\nand empirical: either it does not, nor should not, matter which one it\nis or, if it does matter, then probably one can have an answer if one\ncan detect which institution is being challenged.\n\nThe most natural way to respond to the problem with a\nspectator\u2019s ability to discern a theatrical performance is by\nappeal to some sort of institution or framing device. But such an\nanswer to this problem has the following challenge to consider: in\nAugusto Boal\u2019s so-called \u201cinvisible theater\u201d,\naudiences are usually unaware that some of the people around them are\nactors, acting out a prepared script or scenario, getting a\nconversation going, and being prepared to leave their audience to\ncontinue to discuss the issues raised by the actors, usually about\nclass distinctions and exploitation (Boal 1974 [1979: 143\u2013147]).\nThe challenge is that actors in \u201cinvisible theater\u201d have\neliminated the very institutions or frames that are assumed to be\navailable to spectators.\n\nBoal calls this kind of activity \u201ctheater\u201d because it\ninvolves actors, scripts or scenarios, and audiences. One might argue\nthat in these circumstances there is not, in fact, an\naudience, for they certainly do not recognize themselves as\nsuch. If an audience member\u2019s self-recognition of her social\nrole, qua audience, is necessary for an event\u2019s\ncounting as theater\u2014and not merely her presence in that\nrole\u2014then Boal is simply mistaken in calling it theater,\nalthough it might be \u201ctheatrical\u201d in some tenuous\nsense.\n\nA substantial literature has developed concerning the question whether\nthe presence of an audience is necessary for a theatrical event. Paul\nWoodruff defines theatrical performances as events in which someone\nmakes something \u201cworth watching\u201d (Woodruff 2008:\n18). He also claims that nothing is a theatrical event\u2014although\nit may be a performance\u2014unless there actually is someone\nwatching. However, one could define theater as the making of\nsomething worth watching even if no one is watching it; and something\nshould tie these two thoughts together. Paul Thom (1992) does supply a\nconnection\u2014because he, like some theater theorists, thinks of\ntheater in terms of speech acts and holds that theater addresses its\naudience by uttering an imperative addressed to a particular subject\nordering them to attend to the one making the utterance. This seems,\nat least, to require there be an addressee (but see D. Davies\n2011: 173, for a contrary view). David Osipovich (2006) has held a\nsimilar view to Thom\u2019s but for a different kind of reason.\nOsipovich\u2019s view is based on the demonstrable fact that\nperformers respond to their audiences. They do this, for example, when\nfeeling the \u201cheat\u201d or the \u201cchill\u201d of an\naudience and sometimes adjust their performance to fit the audience\nthey have at a given performance. It follows from this that any\nperformance will be different in some respects from any other\nperformance. A different view from these holds that a theatrical\nperformance is still a theatrical performance even if there is no\naudience. This is because, although the performance may be\nprepared with an audience in mind, the presence of the\naudience is not required for the display of the routine that\nconstitutes the performance. It just happens not to be displayed\nto anyone (Hamilton 2007; D. Davies 2011).\n\nTo respond adequately to Boal\u2019s challenge, views like\nThom\u2019s, Osipovich\u2019s, and possibly Woodruff\u2019s need to\nanswer a further question\u2014whether an audience must not only be\npresent as an audience but also be aware of their role qua\naudience. Yet, on the views of Hamilton and Davies, one need not ask\nthis question because audiences do not even need to be present in\norder for there to be a performance. But, assuming we can credit\nBoal\u2019s case of \u201cinvisible theatre\u201d as a case of\ntheater, it suggests there are two classes of theatrical performances,\none in which spectators do not know that there is a performance at all\nand one in which spectators can determine, either by explicit\nappeal to or an implicit reliance upon an institution or a set of\nframing social practices, that they are watching, hearing, smelling\n(and perhaps tasting or touching) a theatrical performance that\nengages them. And the latter is by far the larger of the two\nclasses.\n",
