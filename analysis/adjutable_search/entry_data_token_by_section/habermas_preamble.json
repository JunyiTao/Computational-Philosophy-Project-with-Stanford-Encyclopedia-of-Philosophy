    "main_text": "\n\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: The following new entry by James Gordon\nFinlayson and Dafydd Huw Rees replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous authors.]\n\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas is one of the leading social theorists and\nphilosophers of the post-Second World War period in Germany, Europe,\nand the US, a prodigiously productive journalist, and a high-profile\npublic intellectual who was at the forefront of the liberalization of\nGerman political culture. He is often labelled a second-generation\nFrankfurt School theorist, though his association with the Frankfurt\nSchool is only one of a rather complex set of allegiances and\ninfluences, and can be misconstrued. This entry will begin with a\nsummary of Habermas\u2019s background and early and transitional\nworks, including his influential concept of the public sphere, before\nmoving on to discuss in detail his three major philosophical projects:\nhis social theory, discourse theory of morality (or \u201cdiscourse\nethics\u201d), and discourse theory of law and democracy. It will\nthen more briefly address Habermas\u2019s methodology and\nphilosophical framework (rational reconstruction and postmetaphysical\nthinking), his applied political theory, focusing on issues of\nnational identity and international law, and finally his recent work\non religion.\n",
