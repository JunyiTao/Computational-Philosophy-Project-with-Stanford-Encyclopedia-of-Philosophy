    "main_text": "The Theory of Humanity\n8. The Theory of Providence and Recompense\n\n\nThe fourth and last treatise of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim is\nprimarily concerned with the principle of reward and punishment and\nits roots. The first part of this treatise (chapters 1\u201328)\ncontains Albo\u2019s central discussion on the theory of providence, while\nthe second part (chapters 29\u201351) incorporates his main\ndiscussion on the theory of recompense. Below we will discuss these\ntwo theories in their order of appearance in the book.\n\n\nAlbo begins this treatise with the statement that humanity has basic\nfree will, for this is the necessary condition of the concept of\nrecompense. Additionally, he argues that this human freedom does not\nconflict with God\u2019s omniscience, nor with the existence of an\nastrological-deterministic system in the universe (treatise 4,\nchapters 1\u20136; Sadik 2012; Weiss 2017). His direct discussion of\nthe concept of divine providence divides into three main parts. First,\nhe discusses the proofs of the veracity of providence from natural and\nhuman reality, and from intellectual investigation (treatise 4,\nchapters 8\u201310). Then he treats the principal theological\nchallenge to the concept of providence, namely, the problem of evil,\nor the suffering of the righteous and success of the wicked (treatise\n4, chapters 12\u201315).  Finally, he examines the specific religious\nconsequences of providence, paying special attention to the\ntheoretical infrastructure of the precepts of prayer (treatise 4,\nchapters 16\u201324) and repentance (treatise 4, chapters\n25\u201328; Ehrlich 2008; Harvey 2015). These last two discussions\nare of exceptional scope within medieval Jewish philosophy.\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s discussions of free will, of proofs for divine providence, and\nof the problem of evil do not include almost any original ideas, and he\nmostly relies on the writings of the Jewish philosophers who preceded\nhim. In contrast, his treatment of prayer and repentance seem to\nreveal a certain level of innovation. Regarding free will, Albo\napparently adopts Maimonides\u2019 opinion that divine knowledge differs\nsignificantly from human knowledge, and that God\u2019s absolute knowledge\ndoes not necessarily abrogate free will for human beings. The academic\nliterature considers several of Albo\u2019s discussions on providence to be\nnothing more than comprehensive summaries of the work of his\nprecursors. This category includes his methods of proving the\nexistence of divine providence over humanity, as well as his attempts\nto defend the concept of God\u2019s absolute good, despite what seems to be\ninjustice in the world (Bleich 1997, 340\u2013358). Still, in the\nrest of the treatise Albo presents broad, methodical discussions on\nthe various philosophical aspects of the issues of prayer and\nrepentance, for which his predecessors addressed mainly the halakhic\nfeatures.\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s central argument on the topic of prayer is that it\ninfluences a person\u2019s status by causing an internal change\nwithin that person.  This change raises the person to a level where he\nreceives constant divine inspiration through God\u2019s\nbenevolence. The basic assumption of this concept is that prayer\ncannot cause any change in God, since such an assumption would detract\nfrom divine perfection. Thus we should conceive of prayer as the\ninternal act of a person upon the self, raising the self to a higher\nspiritual level (treatise 4, chapters 16\u201318). This model stands\nin opposition to the traditional conception of prayer as a channel of\ncommunication between the praying person and the listening God.\n\n\nAlbo understands the significance of repentance in two directions.\nThe first is based on his concept of prayer, and defines repentance as\nan act in which a person uplifts himself to a higher level than at the\ntime of the sin. In this way, he changes his identity, and is no\nlonger deserving of punishment for the act he performed in his\nprevious identity (treatise 4, chapter 18). The second conception of\nrepentance focuses not on the person but on the sinful act he has\ncommitted. Under this rubric, repentance retroactively expropriates\nthe conscious foundations of this act. In other words, repentance\nredefines the sinful act as unintentional, and thus undeserving of\npunishment (treatise 4, chapter 27).\n\n\nThe second half of the fourth treatise of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim\npresents Albo\u2019s theory of recompense. The main issue Albo raises here\nis the character of the reward and punishment destined for a person in\nthe world to come. Throughout his wide-ranging discussion on the\nquestion of recompense in the next world, Albo confronts two\nconflicting points of view. Maimonides views recompense as applying to\nthe soul alone, while Nahmanides opines that it affects the body as\nwell (treatise 4, chapters 29\u201341). Albo\u2019s own opinion on this\nsubject is unclear. At the beginning of the discussion, he seems to\nsupport Maimonides\u2019 viewpoint, but he continues the discussion with\nthe assumption that he cannot definitely rule out Nahmanides\u2019\napproach, which is supported by sources from kabbalistic literature.\nScholars who have discerned the unique character of this section have\ndescribed Albo\u2019s position in almost every possible way. Some say he\navoids commitment (Sarachek 1932, 224), while others think he adopts a\nsynthetic middle position (Schwartz 1997, 202\u2013208); still others\nbelieve he accepts Maimonides\u2019 approach (Husik 1966, 426), and their\nopponents argue that he accepts Nahmanides\u2019 view (Agus 1959,\n238\u2013239). Apparently, therefore, this issue in Albo\u2019s\nphilosophical-religious theory is especially obscure (Ehrlich 2009b).\n",
