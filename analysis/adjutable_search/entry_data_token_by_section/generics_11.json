    "main_text": "Semantic Analyses of Gen || Probabilitistic Approaches\n2.5 Probabilitistic Approaches\n\nCohen (1996, 1999, 2004) argues that generics can be understood in\nterms of comparative probabilities. There are two different ways for a\ngeneric to be true on Cohen\u2019s view. The first way (Absolute) can\nbe illustrated by \u201ctigers are striped\u201d. This is a true\ngeneric because (roughly speaking) a randomly chosen tiger is more\nlikely than not to be striped. The second way (Relative) a generic can\nbe true involves comparison with other kinds. For example, on\nCohen\u2019s account, \u201cmosquitoes carry the West Nile\nvirus\u201d is true because (again roughly speaking) if we pick a\nmosquito and another insect at random, the mosquito is more likely\nthan the insect to carry the West Nile virus. Thus on Cohen\u2019s\nview, generics are made true (or false) by such probabilistic\nconsiderations. More precisely, Cohen\u2019s categories are as\nfollows:\n\nAbsolute generics\n\n\u201cKs are F\u201d is true iff the probability\nthat an arbitrary K that satisfies some predicate in\nAlt(F) satisfies \u201cis F\u201d is greater than\n.5.\n\nRelative Generics\n\n\u201cKs are F\u201d is true iff the probability\nthat an arbitrary K that satisfies some predicate in\nAlt(F) satisfies \u201cis F\u201d is greater than\nthe probability that an arbitrary member of Alt(K) that\nsatisfies some predicate in Alt(F) satisfies \u201cis\nF\u201d.\n\n(In the above, Alt(F) is the set of contextually relevant\nalternatives to the property in question, and Alt(K) is the\nset of contextually relevant alternative kinds to the kind in\nquestion.) As it stands, however, Cohen\u2019s account incorrectly\npredicts that generics such as \u201cbees are sterile\u201d will be\ntrue, since the probability that a given bee is sterile is greater\nthan .5. To deal with such cases, Cohen introduces the homogeneity\nconstraint:\n\nHomogeneity Constraint\n\nThe above probability conditions (exceeding .5, or exceeding that of\nthe arbitrary alternative to the kind) should hold in all salient\npartitions of the kind.\n\nGenerics such as \u201cbees are sterile\u201d are now predicted to\nbe false, because there is a salient partition of bees into workers,\nqueens, and drones, and queen bees have a very low probability of\nbeing sterile.\n\nHowever, Cohen\u2019s account may face some counterexamples. For\nexample, humans are more likely to suffer from autism than other\nmammals, and so \u201chumans are autistic\u201d would seem to be\nfalsely predicted to be a true (relative) generic, and it is hard to\nsee how homogeneity could undermine this prediction (Leslie 2008).\nThis example illustrates that unique possession of a property by a\nkind is not generally sufficient for the truth of a generic, yet the\ncategory of relative generic predicts that, modulo homogeneity, this\nshould suffice.\n\nConversely, consider \u201cmosquitoes carry West Nile virus\u201d.\nThis is a true relative generic on Cohen\u2019s view. However,\nsuppose that fleas also carried the virus, and did so at a somewhat\nhigher rate than mosquitoes. Suppose further that the flea population\nswelled to immense proportions, so that fleas outnumbered all other\ninsects. As the flea population increases, there will come a point at\nwhich mosquitoes cease to be more likely than the arbitrary insect to\ncarry West Nile virus, and so the generic \u201cmosquitoes carry West\nNile virus\u201d would be predicted to become false. It is perhaps\nnatural to think, though, that these are circumstances under which\n\u201cmosquitoes carry West Nile virus\u201d would remain\ntrue\u2014after all, one could still catch the virus from a mosquito!\nIf this is correct, then it suggests that the analysis in terms of\nrelative probability may not be correct (Leslie 2008).\n\nEmpirical work also suggests that the homogeneity constraint does not\nguide people\u2019s understanding of generics. For example, Cimpian,\nGelman, and Brandone (2010) found that adults are not at all reluctant\nto accept a generic that involves a property found only in one salient\npartition of a kind, contra the predictions of the\nhomogeneity constraint (though this was not the intent behind the\nexperiment).\n\nNickel (2012) offers a different kind of counterexample to\nCohen\u2019s account: cases involving polarization. To\nillustrate, Nickel asks us to consider a case in which some Dutch\nsailors are among the best in the world. Moreover, the proportion of\nDutch sailors who meet this high standard exceeds the proportion of\nGerman sailors and the proportion of French sailors who meet it.\nNevertheless, suppose that most Dutch sailors are very poor sailors.\nIntuitively, the generic \u201cDutchmen are good sailors\u201d seems\nfalse in this case. But Cohen\u2019s account implies that it is true,\nfor the probability that a Dutchmen is a good sailor is higher than\nthe probability that someone from a relevant alternative country is a\ngood sailor, and the homogeneity constraint is satisfied.\n",
