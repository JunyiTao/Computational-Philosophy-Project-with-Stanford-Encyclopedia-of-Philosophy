    "main_text": "Terminology\n1. Terminology\n\nThe language here is highly contentious. There are exceptions, but in\na long history mental disorders or illnesses have been referred to as\n\u201cevil\u201d, and \u201cwillful error\u201d or, at the very\nleast, regarded as unwelcome\n misfortune.[1]\n And with some regularity, conditions like those listed in the current\ndiagnostic and classificatory manual of the American Psychiatric\nAssociation (DSM-5 [APA 2013]) and or the International Statistical\nClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11 [WHO\n2020]) have been provided new classificatory titles and terminology,\nsuch revisions often solely aimed at reducing negative and\nstigmatizing associations. Authors cited in what follows use\n\u201cmental disorder\u201d, \u201cpsychiatric disability\u201d,\n\u201cpsychiatric disorder\u201d, \u201cmental illness\u201d,\n\u201cmadness\u201d, \u201cpsychopathology\u201dand\n\u201cneuro-atypicality\u201d. Controversy attaches to these terms,\nas it does to particular diagnostic labels (such as\n\u201cschizophrenia\u201d). Because some would question whether\nthese mental differences are forms of illness or disorder at all, the\nmore neutral but rarely used, \u201cmental difference\u201d perhaps\nbetter accommodates each side of this controversy, so the choice of\n\u201cdisorder\u201d here is for its greater familiarity, and not\nintended to promote a disorder or illness view.\n\nThree changes of language require special attention. With increasing\nfrequency, the term \u201cillness\u201d in \u201cmental\nillness\u201d has been replaced by \u201cdisorder\u201d,\napparently without a consistent rationale beyond avoiding explicitly\nmedical associations. In a parallel recent trend \u201cthe\ncognitive\u201d and \u201ccognition\u201d are sometimes introduced\nas equivalents or replacements for \u201cthe mental\u201d. This new\nlanguage around \u201ccognition\u201d collapses the earlier faculty\npsychology divisions of affection and cognition: as much as doxastic\nstates, emotions are\n \u201ccognitive\u201d.[2]\n Finally, increasing use of \u201cmental and\nbehavioral\u201d, sometimes shortened to\n\u201cbehavioral\u201d (as in \u201cbehavioral health\u201d),\nreflects substantive changes, such as the inclusion of addictions in\nthe class of disorders, and a preference for precisely measurable\nsymptoms over subjective report.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the expression \u201cmental\ndisorder\u201d replaces \u201cmental illness\u201d in what follows,\nand refers not only to more \u201cmental\u201d conditions like\npsychoses and affective disorders, but also to\n\u201cbehavioral\u201d conditions such as addictions and personality\ndisorders. Frequently, the shift from \u2019mental\u2019 to\n\u201ccognitive\u201d also indicates allegiance to substantive\ntheoretical tenets. Here, however, \u201ccognitive\u201d and\n\u201ccognition\u201d are used only as terms of art within\nparticular theoretical analyses.\n",
