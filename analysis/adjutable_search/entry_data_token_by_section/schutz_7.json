    "main_text": "Extensions || Phenomenology\n4. The Schutzian Tradition\n\nIn the years after Schutz\u2019s death in 1959, his works have been\nposthumously published and his thought expanded in several directions.\nPeter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote The Social Construction of\nReality, which focused on how subjective human processes\nconstruct objective structures that human subjectivity in turn\ninterprets and reacts to and which was among the most widely read\nbooks of social science in the twentieth century. Ilja Srubar\nemphasized the importance of the pragmatic dimensions of\nSchutz\u2019s corpus, just as Hans-Georg Soeffner, along with Jochen\nDreher, has developed its symbolic aspects. On Schutzian grounds,\nLester Embree produced a theory of science in the model of a\nWissenschaftslehre, and George Psathas extended\nSchutz\u2019s thought in the direction of ethnomethodology and\nconversation analysis. Recently, sociologists Hubert Knoblauch and\nCarlos Belvedere have shown the relevance of Schutz\u2019s framework\nto communication theory and questions of social ontology,\nrespectively. The Austrian Economic School has continued to make use\nof Schutz\u2019s works, as Daniela Griselda L\u00f3pez has shown.\nL\u00f3pez and Dreher have further argued that Schutzian theory can\nadequately account for the exercise of institutional power through the\ninterplay between objective structures and subjective\nmeaning-interpretation and the idea of relevances that are imposed\nupon agents. Michael Staudigl and George Berguno have edited a\ncollection of essays on the connection between the Schutzian approach\nand various hermeneutic traditions. And Staudigl and Michael Barber\nhave highlighted the connections between Schutz\u2019s philosophy of\nmultiple realities and religion and humor. Furthermore, collections of\nessays have addressed the value of Schutz\u2019s paradigm for music,\nliterature, and the arts. The work of Alfred Schutz opens a wide field\nthat is fruitful for addressing multiple themes and underpinning and\nsupporting multiple disciplines.\n\nIn 2016, the scholarly community in the Schutzian tradition\ncommemorated both the passing of Thomas Luckmann, one of\nSchutz\u2019s renowned students who developed his thought in diverse\nways, and the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of The\nSocial Construction of Reality. These commemorations took place\nthrough the editing of three major collections: Social\nConstructivism as Paradigm?, Lebenswelttheorie und\nGesellschaftsanalyse, and Mathesis Universalis. While\nthese works focus on Luckmann\u2019s work, including The\nStructures of the Life-World that Luckmann co-authored with\nSchutz, several of the essays address aspects of Schutz\u2019s\nthought: the objective dimensions of societal institutions in contrast\nto interpretations of such institutions as subjectivistic and devoid\nof power-relationships (Eberle 2019, Knoblauch 2019, Miji\u0107 2018,\nSrubar 2019); the possibility of a communicative construction of\nreality (Knoblauch 2019); the Schutzian paradigm\u2019s preservation\nof agents\u2019 potential to resist societal control in contrast to\nBourdieu\u2019s account of habitus (Dreher 2019); the role\nof the body in We-relationships (Meyer 2018); the capacity of the\nSchutzian framework to account for resilience in the face of trauma\n(Endress 2021); inequality as imposed relevance (L\u00f3pez 2021);\nspace and bodiliness as pertinent to the life-world as protosociology\n(Miji\u0107 2018, D\u00f6rfler & Rothfuss 2021, Steets 2021);\ndegrees of freedom within Schutz\u2019s relevance theory\n(G\u00f6ttlich 2021); linkages between Schutz\u2019s phenomenology\nand recent representatives of the Frankfurt School, such as Hartmut\nRosa (Gros 2021, Wannenmacher 2021); and the role of the life-world as\na mathesis universalis, that is, the ground-structure of all\nhuman experience that makes possible any comparison between cultures\nwithout reliance on the specific features of any one culture (Dreher\n2021, Meyer 2021, Sebald 2009).\n",
