    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe Parmenides is, quite possibly, the most enigmatic of\nPlato\u2019s dialogues. The dialogue recounts an almost certainly\nfictitious conversation between a venerable Parmenides (the Eleatic\nMonist) and a youthful Socrates, followed by a dizzying array of\ninterconnected arguments presented by Parmenides to a young and\ncompliant interlocutor named \u201cAristotle\u201d (not the\nphilosopher, but rather a man who became one of the Thirty Tyrants\nafter Athens\u2019 surrender to Sparta at the conclusion of the\nPeloponnesian War). Most commentators agree that Socrates articulates\na version of the theory of forms defended by his much older namesake\nin the dialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period, that Parmenides\nmounts a number of potentially devastating challenges to this theory,\nand that these challenges are followed by a piece of intellectual\n\u201cgymnastics\u201d consisting of eight strings of arguments\n(Deductions) that are in some way designed to help us see how to\nprotect the theory of forms against the challenges. Beyond this, there\nis precious little scholarly consensus. Commentators disagree about\nthe proper way to reconstruct Parmenides\u2019 challenges, about the\noverall logical structure of the Deductions, about the main subject of\nthe Deductions, about the function of the Deductions in relation to\nthe challenges, and about the final philosophical moral of the\ndialogue as a whole.\n\n\nThe Parmenides inspired the metaphysical and mystical\ntheories of the later Neoplatonists (notably Plotinus and later,\nProclus), who saw in the Deductions the key to the hierarchical\nontological structure of the universe.\n",
