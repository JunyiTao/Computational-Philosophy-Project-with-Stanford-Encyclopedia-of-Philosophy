    "main_text": "Metaphysical Atomism || Objects as the Substance of the World\n3.1 Objects as the Substance of the World\n\nThe Tractatus\u2019s notion of substance is the modal\nanalogue of Kant\u2019s temporal notion. Whereas for Kant, substance\nis that which \u201cpersists\u201d (in the sense of existing at all\ntimes) (Critique, A 182), for Wittgenstein it is that which,\nfiguratively speaking, \u201cpersists\u201d through a\n\u201cspace\u201d of possible worlds. (Compare the idea of a road\nthat crosses several U.S. States. Such a road might be said,\nmetaphorically speaking, to \u201cpersist\u201d from one State to\nthe next: in such a locution, as in Wittgenstein's, a temporal notion\nis enlisted to do spatial duty, though in Wittgenstein's case the\nspace in question is logical rather than physical space and\npersistence amounts to reaching through the whole of logical\nspace.) Tractarian substance is the \u201cunchanging\u201d in the\nmetaphorical sense of that which does not undergo existence change in\nthe passage (also metaphorical) from world to world. Less\nfiguratively, Tractarian substance is that which exists with respect\nto every possible world. For Kant, to assert that there is substance\n(in the schematized sense of the category) is to say that that there\nis some stuff such that every existence change (i.e., origination or\nannihilation) is necessarily an alteration or reconfiguration of that\nstuff. For Wittgenstein, analogously, to say that there is substance\nis to say that there are some things such that all \u201cexistence\nchanges\u201d in the metaphorical passage from world to world are\nreconfigurations of them. What undergo \u201cexistence changes\u201d\nare atomic states of affairs (configurations of objects): a state of\naffairs exists with respect to one world but fails to exist with\nrespect to another. Those things that remain in existence through\nthese existence changes, and which are reconfigured in the process,\nare Tractarian objects. It follows that the objects that\n\u201cconstitute the substance of the world\u201d (2.021) are\nnecessary existents. The Tractatus , rather wonderfully,\ncompresses this whole metaphorical comparison into a single remark:\n\u201cThe object is the fixed, the existing [das\nBestehende]; the configuration is the changing [das\nWechselnde].\u201d (2.0271). \u201cWechsel,\u201d it\nshould be noted, is the word that Kant expressly reserves for the\nnotion of existence change as opposed to alteration\n(Critique, A 187/B 230). (Unfortunately, however, whether\nWittgenstein had read the Critique in time for this\ncircumstance to have influenced his own phrasing in the\nTractatus is unknown.)\n\nTractarian objects are what any \u201cimagined\u201d\u2014or, more\naccurately, conceivable\u2014world has in common with the\nreal world (2.022). Accordingly, they constitute the world\u2019s\n\u201cfixed form\u201d (2.022\u20133). \u2018Fixed\u2019 because,\nunlike the world\u2019s content, objects (existentially speaking)\nhold fast in the transition from world to world. \u2018Form\u2019\nbecause they constitute what is shared by all the worlds. (On\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of possibility, the notion of an\n\u201calien\u201d Tractarian object \u2014 one which is\nmerely possible \u2014 is not even intelligible). If the\nobjects make up the world\u2019s form, what makes up its content? The\nanswer, I think, is the various obtaining atomic states of affairs.\nDistinct worlds differ with respect to content because they differ\nwith respect to which possible states of affairs obtain in them. A\ncomplication arises becasue possible atomic states of affairs also\nhave both form and content form and content. Their form is the manner\nof combination of their components, their content those components\nthemselves (that is, their contained objects). It follows that\nsubstance \u2014 the totality of objects \u2014 is indeed, as\nWittgenstein says, \u201cboth form and content\u201d\n(2.024\u20135). It is at once both the form of the world and the\ncontent of possible states of affairs (These and further details of\nthis interpretation of Wittgenstein\u2019s conception of substance as\nthe fixed or unchanging are provided in Proops 2004; see also\nZalabardo 2015, Appendix II for more on simples, names, and necessary\nexistents). \n",
