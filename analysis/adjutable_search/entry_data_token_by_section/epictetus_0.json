    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nBorn sometime in the 50s C.E. in Hierapolis, a Greek city of Asia\nMinor, Epictetus spent a portion of his life as the slave of\nEpaphroditus, an important administrator in the court of Nero. The\ndate at which he came to Rome is unknown, but it must have been either\nprior to 68, at which time Epaphroditus fled the capital, or after the\naccession of Domitian in 81, under whom Epaphroditus was allowed to\nreturn and perhaps to resume his position. The circumstances of\nEpictetus\u2019s education are likewise unknown, except that he\nstudied for a time under Musonius Rufus, a Roman senator and Stoic\nphilosopher who taught intermittently at Rome. Eventually receiving\nhis freedom, he began lecturing on his own account but was forced to\nleave the city, presumably by the edict of Domitian (in 89) banning\nphilosophers from the Italian peninsula. He then established his own\nschool at Nicopolis, an important communications hub and\nadministrative center in Epirus, on the Adriatic coast of northwest\nGreece, and remained there teaching and lecturing until his death\naround 135. The teaching represented in the Discourses is\nthat of his later career, around the year 108 by Millar\u2019s (1965)\ndating, at which time he walked with a limp attributed variously to\narthritis or to physical abuse during his time of slavery. Epictetus\nnever married, but for reasons of benevolence he late in life adopted\na child whose parents could not provide for its maintenance.\n\nThe major compilation of Epictetus\u2019s teaching is the work\nstandardly referred to in English as the Discourses; it was\nvariously titled in antiquity. The work we have is in four books, or\nvolumes, but the original work comprised eight or more books.\nAccording to their preface, the Discourses are not the\nwriting of Epictetus but are ghostwritten by the essayist and\nhistoriographer Arrian of Nicomedia in an effort to convey the\npersonal impact of his instruction. Although we lack independent means\nof verification, we have reason to be confident that the works we have\nrepresent Epictetus\u2019s thought rather than Arrian\u2019s own:\nfirst, because the language employed is koin\u0113 or common\nGreek rather than the sophisticated literary language of\nArrian\u2019s other writings; and second because the brusque,\nelliptical manner of expression, the precise philosophical vocabulary,\nand the intellectual rigor of the content are quite different from\nwhat Arrian produces elsewhere. A few scholars, including especially\nDobbin (1998), argue that Epictetus must have composed them himself,\nthe role of Arrian being merely to preserve a mild fiction of\norality.\n\nThe shorter Encheiridion (titled in English either\nManual or Handbook) is a brief abridgment of the\nDiscourses. As such it offers a much attenuated account which\nis of little independent value for the understanding of\nEpictetus\u2019s thought and which at some points gives a misleading\nimpression of his philosophical motivations. There are also some\nquotations by other ancient authors from the Discourses as\nthey knew them. A few of these fragments, notably those numbered by\nSchenkl 8, 9, and 14, are useful supplements to our knowledge of\nEpictetus.\n\nThe standard Greek edition of all the above works is by Schenkl\n(1916); there is also a valuable Loeb edition by Oldfather (2 volumes,\n1926\u201328), and, for the Discourses, an edition by\nSouilh\u00e9 (4 vols., 1948\u201365) which includes a French\ntranslation. Important English translations include, besides\nOldfather, the one occasionally quoted in this article, a revision by\nRobin Hard (1995) of the classic translation by Elizabeth Carter\n(1759). There is also a slightly-abridged translation by Robert Dobbin\n(2008). Dobbin (1998) provides an extensive general introduction and\nnotes to accompany a translation of Discourses Book I. For a\nreliable overview of Epictetus\u2019s main ideas with observations on many\nspecific points, the first port of call is Long (2002). The more\ndetailed treatments by Bonh\u00f6ffer (1890 and 1894), though\nsuperseded by more recent studies on many points, retain considerable\nvalue.\n\nThe so-called \u201cGolden Sayings\u201d is a later compendium of\naphorisms drawn from the Discourses and\nEncheiridion.\n",
