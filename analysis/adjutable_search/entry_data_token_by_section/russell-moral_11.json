    "main_text": "Objections to Emotivism and Relativism || The Problem of Validity\n8.4 The Problem of Validity\n\nIt is a common complaint against emotivism that it precludes the\npossibility of moral arguments that are valid in a non-trivial sense.\nAn argument is formally valid if and only if, no matter how the\nnon-logical vocabulary is interpreted, the premises cannot be true and\nthe conclusion false. But if the premises of a moral argument are not\ntruth-apt\u2014if they are semantically incapable of truth\nor falsity\u2014then all moral arguments, no matter how obviously\n\u201cillogical\u201d they may appear, will be trivially valid,\nsince the premises cannot be true! We can avoid this absurdity by\nmaking explicit what the standard definition of validity\npresupposes\u2014that an argument cannot be a candidate for\nvalidity unless the premises and the conclusions are both truth-apt.\nBut if we do that, moral arguments cease to be candidates for\nvalidity, no matter how logically impeccable they may appear to be.\nStevenson (1944: 154\u2013159) accepts this conclusion as a\nconsequence of his theory, but to the rest of us it seems a very large\ndead rat to swallow.\n\nRussell is immune to this argument as regards \u201cought\u201d,\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d since in his view\nought-judgments are susceptible to truth and falsity. \u201cIt is\nwrong (wrt to B) to kill the innocent\u201d is a truth-apt\nexpression. Hence the argument \u201cIt is wrong (wrt to B) to\nkill the innocent; to bomb the village would be to kill the innocent:\ntherefore it is wrong (wrt to B) to bomb the village\u201d, is\na candidate for validity, and is in fact, valid. To argue from the\nsame premises that it would be right (wrt B) to bomb\nthe village would be obviously fallacious.\n\nBut what about this argument?\n\nIt is good to contemplate whatever is beautiful;\nMichelangelo\u2019s David is beautiful;\n\n\nTherefore\n\nIt is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it obviously valid? And wouldn\u2019t it be obviously\ninvalid to conclude from the same premises that contemplating\nMichelangelo\u2019s David would be bad? Yet if arguments involving\n\u201cgood\u201d are not even candidates for validity, it appears\nthat the two arguments are on a par!\n\nThis is a telling objection against some forms of emotivism\nwhich portray moral judgments as mere expressions of raw feeling,\nanalogous to cries of ecstasy or groans of pain. But Russell is better\nplaced to meet this difficulty, since in his view judgments about what\nis ultimately good and bad are disguised optatives, designed to\nexpress desires or wishes of a certain kind. And it is possible to\nconstruct a rudimentary concept of logical consequence (and hence of\nvalidity) that applies to arguments in the optative mood. Sentences in\nthe optative have fulfillment conditions just as sentences in the\nindicative have truth-conditions. To understand an optative sentence\nis a) to understand that it is in the optative and b) to\nunderstand what the world would have to be like to satisfy the desires\nor the wishes expressed. Just as indicative validity can be defined in\nterms of truth, optative validity can be defined in terms of\nfulfillment. (It would be nice to talk of \u201csatisfaction\u201d\nrather than \u201cfulfillment\u201d here, but the word\n\u201csatisfaction\u201d has been preempted to stand for a different\nbut related notion.) An optative sentence Q is the logical\nconsequence of a set of optative sentences P and a (possibly\nempty) set of factual sentences C, if and only if, however the\nnon-logical vocabulary is interpreted, the desires expressed in\nP cannot be fulfilled under the circumstances described in\nC unless the desire expressed by Q is fulfilled too. An\noptative argument is valid if the conclusion is an optative\nconsequence of the premises; invalid otherwise. Hence there can be\nvalid (and invalid!) arguments about goodness as well as logical\nrelations between the relevant sentences. Thus our argument\nbecomes:\n\n1\u2032.\nWould that everyone desired to contemplate whatever is\nbeautiful!\n2\u2032.\nMichelangelo\u2019s David is beautiful.\n3\u2032.\nWould that everyone desired to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s\nDavid!\n\n\nThis is not perhaps a very plausible reconstruction of the original\nargument, but it is logically valid in the sense defined. For\nthe wish expressed at premise 1\u2032) cannot be fulfilled under the\nfactual conditions specified at premise 2\u2032) without fulfilling\nthe wish expressed at the conclusion 3\u2032).\n",
