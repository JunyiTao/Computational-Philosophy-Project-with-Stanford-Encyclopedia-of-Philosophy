    "main_text": "\n\nJosiah Royce (1855\u20131916) was the leading American proponent of\nabsolute idealism, the metaphysical view (also maintained by G. W. F.\nHegel and F. H. Bradley) that all aspects of reality, including those\nwe experience as disconnected or contradictory, are ultimately unified\nin the thought of a single all-encompassing consciousness. Royce also\nmade original contributions in ethics, philosophy of community,\nphilosophy of religion and logic. His major works include The\nReligious Aspect of Philosophy (1885), The World and the\nIndividual (1899\u20131901), The Philosophy of Loyalty\n(1908), and The Problem of Christianity (1913). Royce\u2019s\nfriendly but longstanding dispute with William James, known as\n\u201cThe Battle of the Absolute,\u201d deeply influenced both\nphilosophers\u2019 thought. In his later works, Royce reconceived his\nmetaphysics as an \u201cabsolute pragmatism\u201d grounded in\nsemiotics. This view dispenses with the Absolute Mind of previous\nidealism and instead characterizes reality as a universe of ideas or\nsigns which occur in a process of being interpreted by an infinite\ncommunity of minds. These minds, and the community they constitute,\nmay themselves be understood as signs. Royce\u2019s ethics,\nphilosophy of community, philosophy of religion, and logic reflect\nthis metaphysical position.\n",
