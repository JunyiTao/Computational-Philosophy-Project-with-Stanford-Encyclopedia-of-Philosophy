    "preamble": "\n\nTheories of judgment, whether cognitive (i.e.,\nobject-representing, thought-expressing, truth-apt) judgment or\npractical (i.e., act-representing, choice-expressing,\nevaluation-apt) judgment, bring together fundamental issues in\nsemantics, logic, cognitive psychology, and epistemology (collectively\nproviding for what can be called the four \u201cfaces\u201d of\ncognitive judgment [see also Martin 2006]), as well as action theory,\nmoral psychology, and ethics (collectively providing for the three\n\u201cfaces\u201d of practical judgment): indeed, the notion of\njudgment is central to any general theory of human rationality. But\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment differs sharply from many other\ntheories of judgment, both traditional and contemporary, in three\nways: (1) by taking the innate capacity for judgment to be the\ncentral cognitive faculty of the rational human mind, (2) by\ninsisting on the semantic, logical, psychological, epistemic, and\npractical priority of the propositional content of a\njudgment, and (3) by systematically embedding judgment within\nthe metaphysics of transcendental idealism . Several serious\nproblems are generated by the interplay of the first two factors with\nthe third. This in turn suggests that the other two parts of\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment can be logically detached from the\nstrongest version of his transcendental idealism and defended\nindependently of it. This entry also includes five supplementary\ndocuments covering (i) the debate about Kant\u2019s conceptualism vs.\nKant\u2019s non-conceptualism, (ii) the epistemology of Kantian\njudgment and the ethics of Kantian belief, (iii) Kant\u2019s logic in\nrelation to his theory of judgment, (iv) kinds of use for judgments,\nand (v) completing the picture of Kant\u2019s metaphysics of\njudgment. \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Nature of Judgment\n\nTheories of cognitive judgment both prior to and after Kant tend to\ndivide dichotomously into the psychologistic and\nplatonistic camps, according to which, on the one hand,\ncognitive judgments are nothing but mental representations of\nrelations of ideas, as, e.g., in the Port Royal Logic (Arnaud &\nNicole 1996), or mentalistic ordered combinings of real individuals,\nuniversals, and logical constants, as, e.g., in Russell\u2019s early\ntheory of judgment (Russell 1966), or on the other hand, cognitive\njudgments are nothing but assertoric psychological states or attitudes\naimed at mind-independent, abstract propositions or thoughts, as,\ne.g., in Bolzano\u2019s and Frege\u2019s theories of judgment\n(Bolzano 1972, Frege 1979, Frege 1984). And, seemingly, never the\ntwain shall meet (Martin 2006, Hanna 2006a, ch. 1). But by sharp\ncontrast to both the psychologistic and platonistic camps,\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment is at once cognitivist,\nanti-psychologistic, and anti-platonistic. More precisely, according\nto Kant, judgments are complex conscious cognitions that (i) refer to\nobjects either directly (via intuitions) or indirectly (via concepts),\n(ii) include concepts that are predicated either of those objects or\nof other constituent concepts, (iii) exemplify pure logical concepts\nand enter into inferences according to pure logical laws, (iv)\nessentially involve both the following of rules and the application of\nrules to the objects picked out by intuitions, (v) express true or\nfalse propositions (truth-aptness), (vi) mediate the formation of\nbeliefs and other intentional acts, and (vii) are unified and\nself-conscious.\n\nThe three leading features of this account are, first, Kant\u2019s\ntaking the innate capacity for judgment to be the central cognitive\nfaculty of the human mind, in the sense that judgment, alone among our\nvarious cognitive achievements, is the joint product of all of the\nother cognitive faculties operating coherently and systematically\ntogether under a single higher-order unity of rational\nself-consciousness (the centrality thesis); second,\nKant\u2019s insistence on the explanatory priority of the\npropositional content of a judgment over its basic cognitive-semantic\nconstituents (i.e., intuitions and concepts), over the logical form of\njudgments, over the inferential role of judgments, over the rule-like\ncharacter of the judgment, over the self-conscious psychological\nstates in which propositions are grasped as well as the\nnon-self-conscious psychological processes in which propositions are\nsynthetically generated, over epistemic beliefs in those propositions,\nover all other propositional attitudes, and also over intentional acts\nguided and mediated by those propositions, including non-epistemic\nacts of various kinds (the priority-of-the-proposition\nthesis); and third, Kant\u2019s background metaphysical doctrine\nto the effect that judgments are empirically meaningful (objectively\nvalid) and true (objectively real) if and only if transcendental\nidealism is correct (the transcendental idealism thesis).\n1.1 The power of judgment and the other faculties of cognition\n\nAccording to Kant, a \u201cjudgment\u201d (Urteil) is a\nspecific kind of \u201ccognition\u201d\n(Erkenntnis)\u2014which he generically defines as any\nconscious mental representation of an object (A320/B376)\u2014that is\nthe characteristic output of the \u201cpower of judgment\u201d\n(Urteilskraft). The power of judgment, in turn, is a\ncognitive \u201ccapacity\u201d (F\u00e4higkeit) but also\nspecifically a spontaneous and innate cognitive\ncapacity, and in virtue of these it is the \u201cfaculty of\njudging\u201d (Verm\u00f6gen zu urteilen) (A69/B94), which\nis also the same as the \u201cfaculty of thinking\u201d\n(Verm\u00f6gen zu denken) (A81/B106).\n\nFor Kant the mind is essentially active and vital\u2014\u201cthe\nmind (Gem\u00fct) for itself is entirely life (the principle\nof life itself)\u201d (5: 278)\u2014and a cognitive capacity in turn\nis a determinate conscious propensity of the mind to generate\nobjective representations of certain kinds under certain conditions.\nWhat do spontaneity and innateness add to a mere capacity for\ncognition, so that it becomes a \u201cfaculty of\ncognition\u201d (Erkenntnisverm\u00f6gen)? A cognitive\nfaculty is spontaneous in that whenever it is externally stimulated by\nraw unstructured sensory data as inputs, it then automatically\norganizes or \u201csynthesizes\u201d those data in an unprecedented\nway relative to those inputs, thereby yielding novel structured\ncognitions as outputs (B1\u20132, A50/B74, B132, B152). So cognitive\nspontaneity is a structural creativity of the mind with\nrespect to its representations. It is a controverted question of\nrecent Kant-interpretation whether cognitive spontaneity derives\nexclusively from the conceptual or discursive capacity of the rational\nhuman mind (B152) (Longuenesse 1998, chs. 1\u20133, 5, 8), or can\nalso derive independently from the intuitional, non-conceptual, or\nsensible capacity of the rational human mind, shared with minded\nnon-rational human or non-human animals (B151) (Hanna 2006b, ch. 1,\nMcLear 2011). Correspondingly, it is also a controverted question\nwhether according to Kant there is only one basic kind of synthesis,\ni.e., conceptual/discursive synthesis, or two basic kinds, i.e.,\nconceptual/discursive synthesis and\nintuitional/non-conceptual/sensible synthesis. These controverted\nquestions, in turn, are closely connected with the recent vigorous\ndebate about Kant\u2019s conceptualism vs. Kant\u2019s\nnon-conceptualism in relation to his theory of judgment, and the\nimplications of this for interpreting and critically evaluating\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism and the Transcendental Deduction\nof the Pure Concepts of the Understanding, a.k.a. \u201cthe\nCategories\u201d (see the supplementary document\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism\n and Sections 4.1 to 4.2 below). \n\nKant also uses the term \u2018spontaneity\u2019 in a somewhat\ndifferent sense in a metaphysical context, to refer to a mental cause\nthat can sufficiently determine an effect in time while also lacking\nany temporally prior sufficient cause of itself (A445/B473). Call this\npractical spontaneity. What is shared between the two senses\nof spontaneity, practical and cognitive, is the unprecedented,\ncreative character of the mind\u2019s operations. But in the\ncognitive sense of spontaneity, what is crucial is that the sensory\ndata manifest \u201cpoverty of the stimulus\u201d (Cook & Newson\n1996, 81\u201385)\u2014significant underdetermination of the outputs\nof an embodied cognitive capacity by the relevant inputs to that\ncapacity, plus previous experiences or habituation\u2014although the\nfaculty\u2019s spontaneity must also always be minimally conditioned\nby external sensory triggering (B1\u20132). Correspondingly, a\nKantian cognitive faculty is innate in the threefold sense that (i) it\nis intrinsic to the mind, hence a necessary part of the nature of the\nrational animal possessing that faculty, (ii) it contains internal\nstructures that are necessarily or strictly underdetermined by any and\nall sensory impressions and/or empirical facts\u2014which is the same\nas their being a priori (B2), and (iii) it automatically\nsystematically synthesizes those sensory inputs according to special\nnormative rules that directly reflect the internal structures of the\nfaculty, thereby generating its correlatively-structured outputs. So\nKantian innateness is essentially a procedure-based\ninnateness, consisting in an a priori active readiness of the mind for\nimplementing normative rules of synthesis, as opposed to the\ncontent-based innateness of Cartesian and Leibnizian innate\nideas, according to which an infinitely large supply of complete\n(e.g., mathematical) beliefs, propositions, or concepts themselves are\neither occurrently or dispositionally intrinsic to the mind. But as\nLocke pointed out, this implausibly overloads the human mind\u2019s\nlimited storage capacities.\n\nIn contrast to both Rationalists and Empiricists, who hold that the\nhuman mind has only one basic cognitive faculty\u2014reason or sense\nperception, respectively\u2014Kant is a cognitive-faculty\ndualist who holds that the human mind has two basic\ncognitive faculties: (i) the \u201cunderstanding\u201d\n(Verstand), the faculty of concepts, thought, and\ndiscursivity, and (ii) the \u201csensibility\u201d\n(Sinnlichkeit), the faculty of intuitions/non-conceptual\ncognitions, sense perception, and mental imagery (A51/B75). The\nessential difference between the faculties of understanding and\nsensibility, and correspondingly the essential difference between\nconcepts and intuitions (A50\u201352/B74\u201376), as distinct kinds\nof cognition, is a fundamental commitment of Kant\u2019s theory of\ncognition generally and of his theory of judgment more specifically.\nConcepts are at once (a) general representations having the logical\nform of universality (9: 91), (b) discursive representations\nexpressing pure logical forms and falling under pure logical laws\n(A68\u201370/B92\u201394, A239/B298), (c) complex intensions ranging\nover \u201ccomprehensions\u201d (Umfangen) that contain all\nactual and possible objects falling under those intensions, as well as\nother narrower comprehensions (9: 95\u201396), (d) mediate or\nindirect (i.e., attributive or descriptive) representations of\nindividual objects (A320/B376\u2013377), (e) rules for classifying\nand organizing perceptions of objects (A106), and (f)\n\u201creflected\u201d representations expressing the higher-order\nunity of rational self-consciousness, a.k.a.\n\u201capperception\u201d (B133 and 133n.). Intuitions by contrast\nare conscious object-directed representations that are (1) singular\n(A320/B377) (9: 91), (2) sense-related (A19/B33, A51/B75), (3)\nobject-dependent (B72) (4: 281), (4) immediate, or directly\nreferential (A90\u201391/B122\u2013123, B132, B145), and, above all,\n(5) non-conceptual (A284/B340) (9: 99) (Hanna 2001, ch. 4).\n\nUnderstanding and sensibility are both subserved by the faculty of\n\u201cimagination\u201d (Einbildungskraft), which when\ntaken generically is the source or engine of all sorts of synthesis,\nbut which when taken as a \u201cdedicated\u201d or task-sensitive\ncognitive faculty, construed as either \u201cproductive\u201d or\n\u201creproductive,\u201d more specifically generates (\u03b1) the\nspatial and temporal forms of intuition, (\u03b2) novel mental imagery\nin conscious sensory states, (\u03b3) reproductive imagery or\nmemories, and (\u03b4) \u201cschemata,\u201d which are\nsupplementary rules for interpreting general conceptual rules in terms\nof more specific figural (spatiotemporal) forms and sensory images\n(A78/B103, B151, A100\u2013102, A137\u2013142/B176\u2013181) (7:\n167). At least in principle, then, the imagination mediates between\nthe understanding and the sensibility by virtue of being an autonomous\nthird basic cognitive capacity containing elements of each of the\nbasic dual capacities (see,e.g., A115\u2013119 and\nA139\u2013142/B178\u2013181)\u2014which would, in effect, make Kant\na cognitive-capacity trinitarian. But sometimes, contrariwise\nand somewhat incoherently, Kant seems instead to say that the\nimagination at once (i) belongs to sensibility and yet also\n(ii) is caused by the action of the understanding on\nsensibility. This deep unclarity about the nature of the imagination,\nin addition to being a flashpoint for important longstanding\ndisagreements in Kant-scholarship on his theory of judgment (see,\ne.g., Heidegger 1990, Waxman 1991, Longuenesse 1998), also has some\nserious implications for Kant\u2019s theory of judgment itself\n(again, see the supplementary document\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism\n and Sections 4.1 to 4.2 below).\n\nJust as understanding and sensibility are subserved by the\nbottom-up cognitive processing of the imagination, so in turn they are\nalso superserved by the top-down cognitive processing of the\nfaculty of \u201creason\u201d (Vernunft), which produces\nlogical inferences, carries out pragmatic or moral choices and\ndecisions, a.k.a. \u201cpractical judgments\u201d), imposes\ncoherence and consistency on all sorts of cognitions, and above all\nrecognizes and implements strongly modal and categorically normative\nconcepts such as necessary truth and unconditional obligation, in the\nform of lawlike \u201cprinciples\u201d (Principien,\nGrunds\u00e4tze) (A299\u2013304/B355\u2013361,\nA800\u2013804/B828\u2013832).\n\nFinally, the objective unity of any judgment whatsoever is guaranteed\nby the faculty of apperception or rational self-consciousness, which\nplays the \u201cexecutive\u201d role in the corporate organization\nof the mind by introducing a single higher-order unity into all of its\nlower-order representations, via judgment, and whose characteristic\noutput is the cogito-like self-directed judgment-forming\nrepresentation \u201cI think\u201d (Ich denke): as\nin \u201cI think about X\u201d (where X is some\nconcept, say the concept of being a philosopher) or \u201cI think\nthat P\u201d (where that-P is some proposition, say\nthe proposition that Kant is a philosopher) (B131\u2013132). The\nI think according to Kant is \u201cthe vehicle of all\nconcepts and judgments whatever\u201d (A341/B399), because it is both\na necessary condition of the objective unity of every judgment and\nalso automatically implements one or another of a set of primitive\npure a priori logical forms or functions of unity in judgments or\nthoughts\u2014\u201cthe pure concepts of the understanding\u201d or\n\u201ccategories\u201d (A66\u201383/B91\u2013116)\u2014in the\nseveral semantic constituents of that judgment.\n\nThe power of judgment, while a non-basic faculty, is\nnevertheless the central cognitive faculty of the human mind.\nThis is because judging brings together all the otherwise\nuncoordinated sub-acts and sub-contents of intuition,\nconceptualization, imagination, and reason, via apperception or\nrational self-consciousness, for the purpose of generating a single\ncognitive product, the judgment, under the overarching pure concepts\nof the understanding or categories, thereby fully integrating the\nseveral distinct cognitive faculties and their several distinct sorts\nof representational information, and thereby also constituting a\nsingle rational human animal. For Kant then, rational humans are\njudging animals.\n1.2 Judgments are essentially propositional cognitions\n\nBut what exactly are judgments? Kant\u2019s answer, in a\nnutshell, is that they are essentially propositional\ncognitions\u2014from which it immediately follows that rational\nhumans are, more precisely, propositional animals. In what\nsense, however, is this the case?\n\nLogicians before Kant, e.g., the Port Royalists, tended to define\njudgment as a \u201crepresentation of a relation between two\nconcepts\u201d (B140). This pre-Kantian definition implied that all\njudgments are of subject-predicate form; but in fact, as Kant points\nout (here following the Stoic logicians), some judgments\u2014e.g.,\ndisjunctive judgments, and hypothetical conditional\njudgments\u2014are truth-valued relational complexes of\nsubject-predicate judgments and thus, apparently, have essentially\ntruth-functional form, not subject-predicate form. This idea\nlater heavily influenced George Boole\u2019s ground-breaking view of\nlogic as a set of a priori \u201claws of thought\u201d governing a\nformal calculus of binary functions that mimic the\n\u201cbipolar\u201d behavior of the classical truth and falsity of\npropositions (Boole 1854). Perhaps even more importantly however, the\npre-Kantian definition also failed to explain the unity of a\njudgment, and the difference between a judgment and a mere list of\nconcepts. So in order to solve this\n\u201cunity-of-the-judgment\u201d problem\u2014which later\nre-surfaced as \u201cthe problem of the unity of the\nproposition\u201d in early analytic philosophy (Hylton 1984, Linsky\n1992)\u2014Kant offers a radically new conception of the judgment as\na higher-order cognitive binding function for different types of\nlower-order objective representational content. In a pre-Critical\nessay, \u201cThe False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic\nFigures,\u201d he says that a judgment is an act of logical\npredication whereby a concept is applied to a thing, as expressed by\nthe copula \u2018is\u2019 or \u2018are\u2019 (2: 47). In his\nlogical textbook, the J\u00e4sche Logic, he says that it is a\nrepresentation of the unity of consciousness linking together several\nother representations, or a representation of their relation in a\nsingle concept (9: 101). And in the Critique of Pure Reason\nhe characterizes judgment at least four times:\n\nJudgment is \u2026 the mediate cognition of an object, hence the\nrepresentation of a representation of it. In every judgment there is a\nconcept that holds of many [representations], and that among this many\nalso comprehends a given representation, which is then immediately\nreferred to the object. (A68/B93)\n\n\nAll judgments are \u2026 functions of unity among our\nrepresentations, since instead of an immediate representation a higher\none, which comprehends this and other representations under itself, is\nused for the cognition of the object, and many possible cognitions are\nhereby drawn together into one. (A69/B94)\n\n\nA judgment is nothing other than the way to bring given cognitions to\nthe objective unity of apperception. That is the aim\nof the copula is in them: to distinguish the\nobjective unity of given representations from the subjective. (B141).\n\n\n[Pure general logic] deals with concepts,\njudgments, and inferences,\ncorresponding exactly to the functions and order of those powers of\nthe mind, which are comprehended under the broad designation of\nunderstanding in general\u2026 If the understanding in general is\nexplained as the faculty of rules, then the power of judgment is the\nfaculty of subsuming under rules, i.e., of\ndetermining whether something stands under a given rule (casus\ndatae legis) or not. (A130\u2013132/B170\u2013172)\n\n\nDespite the superficial differences in emphasis and formulation, these\nsix characterizations all converge on the same basic account: a\njudgment is a higher-order complex conscious cognition that refers to\nobjects either directly (via the essentially indexical content of\nintuitions/non-conceptual cognitions)or indirectly (via the\nessentially attributive or descriptive content of concepts); in which\nconcepts are predicated either of those objects or of other\nconstituent concepts; in which concepts are intrinsically related to\none another and to intuitional/non-conceptual cognitions by pure\ngeneral logical forms/pure concepts of the understanding that express\nvarious modifications and, apparently, truth-functional compounds of\nthe predicative copula; which enters into inferences according to a\npriori laws of pure general logic; which essentially involves both the\nfollowing of rules and the application of rules to the perceptual\nobjects picked out by intuition/non-conceptual cognition; and in which\na composite objective representation is generated and unified by the\nhigher-order executive mental processing of a single self-conscious\nrational subject. The crucial take-away points here are (a) a\njudgment\u2019s referential bottoming-out in\nintuitions/non-conceptual cognitions, which thereby constitute\ndirectly-referential singular terms in singular categorical judgments,\nthat cannot be semantically replaced by individual concepts or\ndefinite descriptions without change or loss of meaning (contrast,\ne.g., Thompson 1972 and Hanna 2001, ch. 4), (b) the \u201cprivileging\nof predication\u201d (Longuenesse 1998, 104) over other sorts of\nlogical operations, (c) the intrinsic logico-syntactic and\nlogico-semantic form of the judgment, based on modifications or\ncompound truth-functional relations of the predicative copula, (d) the\nrule-like character of the judgment, (e) the judgment\u2019s unified\nconscious objective representational (i.e., semantic) content, and\nabove all (f) its higher-order rationally self-conscious ground of\nobjective unity. As such, Kantian judgments are neither\nmerely psychological objects or processes (as in psychologistic\ntheories of judgment), nor are they essentially\nmind-independent, abstract objects (as in platonistic theories of\njudgment), nor again are they inherently assertoric takings\nof propositions to be true (as, e.g., in Frege\u2019s theory of\njudgment). Instead, Kantian judgments are intersubjectively shareable,\nrationally communicable, cognitively-generated mental-act structures\nor types whose logically-structured truth-apt semantic contents can be\nthe targets of many different kinds of epistemic or non-epistemic\npropositional attitudes. \n\nAs just noted, every judgment has an intrinsic logical form\nthat is both syntactic and semantic in nature, centered on\npredication. Even more fundamentally however, every judgment also has\nan \u201cintension\u201d (Inhalt) or semantic\ncontent: the \u201cproposition\u201d (Satz). A\npropositional content is not monolithic but rather a unified composite\nof individually meaningful proper parts. More specifically, a\nproposition is the logically well-formed and semantically\nwell-composed, truth-valued, unified objective representational\ncontent of a judgment; and more generally it is \u201cwhat is\njudged\u201d in the act of putting forward any sort of rational claim\nabout the world (9: 109) (14: 659\u2013660) (24: 934). Although a\nproposition is always generated by means of psychological processes,\nit is not, however, psychologically private and\nincommunicable: on the contrary, it is intersubjectively shareable and\nrationally communicable, due to the fact that the very same\npropositional form-and-content can be individually generated by many\ndifferent judging animals, provided they are all equipped with the\nsame basic cognitive architecture. In this way judgments for Kant are\nessentially propositional cognitions, in that the primary\nfunction of the faculty of judgment is just to generate these\nlogically well-formed, semantically well-composed, truth-valued,\nintersubjectively shareable, rationally communicable, unified\nobjective representational contents.\n\nGiven the seminal role of the judgment\u2019s propositional content,\nit is easy to see then that for Kant the propositional function of the\njudgment is more basic than its inferential role\u2014although every\njudgment does indeed play an inferential role (Longuenesse 1998,\n90\u201395)\u2014and for this reason Kant\u2019s logical constants\n(i.e., all, some, this/the, affirmation, propositional negation,\npredicate-negation, the predicative copula, if-then, disjunction,\nnecessarily, possibly, and actually) are defined strictly in terms of\ntheir specific roles in the propositional content of judgments, quite\napart from the ways those judgments can enter into inferences\n(A69\u201376/B94\u2013102). In recent years, however,\ninferentialist treatments of Kant\u2019s theory of judgment\nand Kant\u2019s logic, which treat the semantic contents and logical\nconstants of judgment as essentially dependent on and determined by\ntheir inferential roles, have become increasingly popular and\ninfluential (see, e.g., Landy 2009 and Leech 2012).\n1.3 Judgments, objective validity, objective reality, and truth\n\nThe characteristically rational activity of taking-for-true implies\nthe subjective validity of a judgment, or its apparent meaningfulness\nand apparent truth for an individual rational cognizer. By contrast,\nthe \u201cobjective validity\u201d (objektiv\nG\u00fcltigkeit) of a judgment is its empirical meaningfulness,\nprecisely because it is compositionally based on the empirical\n\u201creference\u201d (Beziehung)\u2014whether singular or\ncomprehensional\u2014of the basic constituent objective\nrepresentations of any judgment, namely intuitions and concepts. The\nempirical reference of intuitions and concepts, in turn, is\nnecessarily constrained by the specifically aesthetic or sensible,\nnon-conceptual, non-discursive, and pre-rational or proto-rational\ndimension of human experience, which itself is jointly determined by\n(a) the brute givenness of material objects to our receptive capacity\nfor empirical intuition, via the relation of external affection, and\n(b) the necessary and non-empirical forms of empirical intuition, our\nrepresentations of space and time (A19\u201322/B33\u201336), which\nultimately express the outer and inner sensory aspects of the\nembodiment of our minds). In this way, an intuition is objectively\nvalid if and only if either (i) it directly refers to some individual\nactual or possible external sensible object or to the subject\u2019s\nphenomenally conscious inner response to this outer reference (this\naccounts for the objective validity of empirical intuitions),\nor else (ii) it represents a phenomenally immanent necessary condition\nof empirical intuitions (this accounts for the objective validity of\nthe forms of intuition) (A239\u2013240/B298\u2013299). By\ncontrast, a concept is objectively valid if and only if either it\napplies to some actual or possible objects of empirical intuition\n(this accounts for the objective validity of empirical\nconcepts) or else it represents a necessary condition of empirical\nconcepts (this accounts for the objective validity of pure\nconcepts) (A239\u2013240/B298\u2013299,\nA240\u2013242/B299\u2013300).\n\nA necessary but not sufficient condition of the objective validity of\na judgment is its logico-syntactic well-formedness (grammatical\ncorrectness) and logico-semantic well-formedness (sortal correctness)\n(A73/98, A240\u2013248/B300\u2013305). So a judgment is objectively\nvalid if and only if it is logically well-formed and all of its\nconstituent intuitions and concepts are objectively valid\n(A155\u2013156/B194\u2013195). Otherwise put, and fully spelled-out,\nthe objective validity of a judgment is its anthropocentric\nrational empirical referential meaningfulness. Kant also\nsometimes uses the notion of \u201cobjective reality\u201d\n(objektive Realit\u00e4t) to characterize objectively valid\nrepresentations that apply specifically to actually or really existing\nobjects, and not to merely possible objects (A242 n.). True judgments\nare thus objectively real propositions. Objective validity, in turn,\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition of truth, and hence of\nobjectively real propositions, for false judgments are also\nobjectively valid (A58/B83). In this way the objective validity of a\njudgment is equivalent to its propositional truth-valuedness,\nbut not equivalent to its propositional truth.\n\nBy contrast, all judgments that are not objectively valid are\n\u201cempty\u201d (leer) or truth-valueless. Nevertheless,\nit must be noted that for Kant empty judgments can still be rationally\nintelligible and not in any way nonsensical, if all the concepts\ncontained within them are at least logically consistent or\n\u201cthinkable\u201d (Bxxvi n.). In this way, e.g., some judgments\ncontaining concepts of noumenal objects (things-in-themselves, or real\nessences) or noumenal subjects (rational-agents-in-themselves, or\npersons) are empirically meaningless and truth-valueless, hence empty,\nyet also are rationally intelligible targets of what Kant\ncalls \u201cdoctrinal\u201d belief (see the supplementary document\n Judging, Believing, and Scientific Knowing),\n and even, at least from a certain Critical meta-philosophical\nstandpoint, essential both to Kant\u2019s theoretical metaphysics\n(A254\u2013255/B309\u2013310, A650\u2013654/B678\u2013682) and\nalso to his practical metaphysics of freedom and morality\n(A530\u2013558/B566\u2013586).\n\nSo much for truth-valuedness: but what is truth? According to Kant,\ntruth is a predicate of whole judgments, and not a predicate of the\nrepresentational proper parts of judgments, i.e.,\nintuitions/non-conceptual cognitions and concepts (A293/B350).\nFurthermore we already know that objective validity is a necessary but\nnot sufficient condition of the truth of a judgment. Kant also holds\nthat logical consistency is a necessary but not sufficient condition\nof the truth of a judgment (A60/B85). Most importantly however,\naccording to Kant the \u201cnominal definition\u201d of truth is\nthat it is the \u201cagreement\u201d or \u201ccorrespondence\u201d\n(\u00dcbereinstimmung) of a cognition (i.e., in this context,\nan objectively valid judgment) with its object (A58/B82). Now a\nKantian nominal definition is a special type of analytic definition\nthat picks out the \u201clogical essence\u201d of that\nconcept\u2014i.e., the generic and specific intensional criteria for\nbringing things under that concept\u2014but without also\npicking out the \u201cinner determinations\u201d or real essences of\nthe things falling within the comprehension of that concept, which\nwould be the job of a real definition (9: 142\u2013143). So\nthe nominal definition of truth means that for Kant truth just\nis agreement or correspondence, which can then be further\nunpacked as a relation between a judgment and an object such that (i)\nthe form or structure of the object is isomorphic with the\nlogico-syntactic and logico-semantic form of the proposition expressed\nby the judgment, (ii) the judger cognitively orients herself in the\nworld by projecting the object under specific \u201cpoints of\nview\u201d (Gesichtspunkte) or modes of presentation that\nwould also be typically cognitively associated with the constituent\nconcepts of the judgment by any other rational human animal in that\ncontext (8: 134\u2013137) (9: 57, 147) (24: 779), and (iii) the\nobject represented by the judgment really exists (Hanna 2006b, ch. 5).\nAnother way of putting this is to say that truth is nothing but\nthe objective reality of the total propositional\nform-and-content of the judgment: that is, nothing but the real\nexistence of that which is precisely specified by the logico-syntactic\nand logico-semantic features of the judgment taken together with the\njudger\u2019s intersubjectively rationally communicable cognitive\norientation. Or in still other words, true judgments are nothing\nbut ways of rationally projecting ourselves onto actual\ntruth-makers. This is not what is nowadays called a\n\u201cdeflationist\u201d conception of truth, however, because Kant\nis not saying that truth is nothing but asserting the corresponding\nactual facts. On the contrary, for Kant truth is irreducible to merely\nasserting the facts, because for him the concept of truth also\ninherently expresses both the judger\u2019s fundamental rational\ninterest in \u201cgetting it right\u201d (whether theoretically via\ntrue judgment or practically via good intentional action) and also her\nintersubjectively shareable and rationally communicable cognitive\norientation, as well as belonging intrinsically to the core moral\nconcept of sincerity.\n\nIn any case, the nominal definition of truth must be sharply\ndistinguished from the real definition of truth, i.e., the\n\u201ccriterion\u201d (Kriterium) of truth, which is a rule\nfor determining the truth or falsity of judgments in specific contexts\n(A58/B82). According to Kant there is no all-purpose or absolutely\ngeneral criterion of truth (A58\u201359), such as the\n\u201cclarity-and-distinctness\u201d criterion of the Cartesians.\nNevertheless there are special criteria of truth for each of\nthe basic classes of judgments: analytic judgments, synthetic a\nposteriori (or empirical) judgments, and synthetic a priori judgments\n(for more details about this threefold distinction and the special\ntruth-criteria, see\n Section 2).\n\nThe truth of empirical judgments is the bottom-level sort of truth for\nKant, in that all of the other kinds of truth presuppose it. In turn,\nthe proper object of an empirical judgment is an actual or possible\n\u201cobject of experience\u201d (Gegenstand der\nErfahrung), which is an empirical state-of-affairs, or a really\npossible individual material object insofar as it has macroscopic\nphysical or \u201cphenomenological\u201d (in the Newtonian sense)\nproperties and can enter into causal or otherwise dynamical relations\nin the spatiotemporal material world according to necessary laws of\nnature (A176\u2013218/B218\u2013265). By the nominal definition of\ntruth as agreement or correspondence, this entails that actual objects\nof experience are the truth-makers of empirical judgments. It\nalso leads to what Kant calls \u201cthe criterion of empirical\ntruth\u201d which states that since the objectively valid\npropositional content of an empirical judgment can be specified as a\nnecessary conceptual rule of sensory appearances, then if\nthat rule is effectively applied to the temporal succession of our\nsensory representations of the phenomenal material world, and\nthat rule coheres with the causal-dynamic laws of nature,\nthen that judgment is true (A191/B236, A451/B479) (4: 290)\n(18: 234).\n\nSee the supplementary documents:\n\n\nThe Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism\n\n\nJudging, Believing, and Scientific Knowing\n\n\n2. Kinds of Judgments\n\nOne of the most controversial, influential, and striking parts of\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment is his multiple classification of\njudgments according to kinds of logical form and kinds of semantic\ncontent. Indeed the very importance of Kant\u2019s multiple\nclassification of judgments has sometimes led to the misconception\nthat his theory of judgment will stand or fall according to the fate\nof, e.g., his analytic-synthetic distinction, or his doctrine of\nsynthetic a priori judgments. Important as these classifications are\nhowever, it is crucial to remember that the core of Kant\u2019s\ntheory of judgment consists in the centrality thesis, the\npriority-of-the-proposition thesis, and the transcendental idealism\nthesis, all of which can still hold even if some of his\nclassifications of judgments are rejected.\n2.1 Kinds of logical form\n\nThe modern conception of logical form\u2014as found, e.g., in the\nsymbolic and mathematical logic of Gottlob Frege\u2019s\nBegriffsschrift (\u201cConceptual Notation\u201d) (Frege\n1972), Bertrand Russell and A.N. Whitehead\u2019s Principia\nMathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1962), and Ludwig\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\n(Wittgenstein 1922)\u2014owes much to Kant\u2019s conception of\nlogical form, if not so very much to his particular conception of\nlogic, which from a contemporary point of view can seem\n\u201cterrifyingly narrow-minded and mathematically trivial,\u201d\nas Allen Hazen has drily put it (Hazen 1999). On the other hand,\nhowever, it is clearly true that Kant\u2019s conception of\nmathematical form, which is found in his theory of pure or\nformal intuition, substantially influenced Wittgenstein\u2019s view\nof logical form in the Tractatus (Wittgenstein 1922, props.\n2.013, 5.552, 5.61, and 6.13). There is an ongoing scholarly debate\nabout whether Kant\u2019s conception of mathematical form is a direct\nexpression of the narrow-mindedness of his logical theory, or instead\na direct expression of the striking originality of his philosophy of\nmathematics (Parsons 1983, Friedman 1992, Shabel 2003, Hanna 2006b,\nch. 6, Shabel 2006). But even more importantly, Kant\u2019s deep idea\nthat logic and logical form can exist only in the context of the\njudging activities and judging capacities of rational human\nanimals, has heavily influenced some heavily influential\nphilosophers of logic, linguists, philosophers of language, and\ncognitive scientists from Boole and Wilhelm von Humboldt (Von Humboldt\n1988), to Frege, the later Wittgenstein, and Noam Chomsky\n(Wittgenstein 1953, para. 241\u2013242, Chomsky 1975, Bell 1979, Bell\n1987).\n2.1.1 Pure general logic and the table of judgments\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 1,\n every judgment for Kant has an intrinsic logical form. These logical\nforms correspond one-to-one to the pure concepts of the understanding\nor categories, a claim which is argued-for in what Kant calls the\nmetaphysical deduction of the categories\n(A76\u201383/B102\u2013109, B159). On the basis of this, it is\npossible to argue that all concepts, whether pure or empirical, have a\nlogical ground (Newton 2015). In any case, the total set of such\nlogical forms/pure concepts is the \u201ctable of judgments,\u201d\nwhich Kant also describes as \u201cthe functions of unity in\njudgments\u201d (A69/B94, emphasis added). He does this in order\nto draw special attention to the fact that for him the very idea of a\nlogical form/pure concept is essentially judgment-based: logical form\nis nothing but the intrinsic logico-syntactic and logico-semantic form\nof and in a proposition. So for Kant the\npropositional content of a judgment is more explanatorily basic than\nits logical form or pure-conceptual structure.\n\nThe table of judgments, in turn, captures a fundamental part of the\nscience of pure general logic: pure, because it is a priori,\nnecessary, hence strictly universally true, and also without any\nassociated sensory content; general, because it is strictly\nunderdetermined by all objectively valid representational contents and\nalso abstracts away from all specific or particular differences\nbetween represented objects (cf. MacFarlane 2002), and thereby\n\u201chas to do with nothing but the mere form of thinking\u201d\n(A54/B78); and logic because, in addition to the table of\njudgments, it also systematically provides categorically normative\nconditio sine qua non rules for the truth of judgments (i.e.,\nthe law of non-contradiction or logical consistency) and for valid\ninference (i.e., the law of logical consequence)\n(A52\u201355/B76\u201379) (9: 11\u201316).\n\nIn this connection, there are two crucial points to note about\nKant\u2019s pure general logic.\n\nFirst, pure general logic is sharply distinct from\ntranscendental logic, in that, although both logics are pure\nand a priori, whereas pure general logic is \u201cgeneral\u201d in\nthat it is strictly underdetermined by all objectively valid\nrepresentational contents and also abstracts away from all specific or\nparticular differences between represented objects, hence is\nontically unrestricted, nevertheless transcendental logic is\n\u201cspecial\u201d in that it is ontically restricted,\ni.e., objectually-committed, and thereby presupposes the existence of\ncertain specific categories or kinds (including natural kinds) of\nobjects (A55\u201357/B79\u201382). In this way, transcendental logic\npresupposes pure general logic, and is synthetic a priori, not\nanalytic. Some recent Kant-commentators, however, have argued that on\nthe contrary, pure general logic presupposes transcendental logic\n(see, e.g., R\u00f6dl 2008, Tolley 2012), on the grounds that for\nKant, thought by its very nature is object-directed. But the\ngenerality and inherently formal character of pure general logic is\nfully consistent with its being objectively valid: hence the fact that\nthought by its very nature is object-directed does not by\nitself imply that the logic governing thought is ontically\nrestricted or objectually-committed.\n\nSecond, pure general logic is absolutely binding on any rational human\nthinker and provides an unconditional logical ought: the laws\nof logic are the categorically normative laws of thought for all\nactual and possible rational animals. Thus pure general logic is both\na formal science and also a moral science, but not a\nnatural science. As such, pure general logic fully heeds the\nlesson of the Naturalistic Fallacy, that is, the irreducibility of the\nought to the is. Correspondingly, just like the\nunconditional moral ought, as expressed by the Categorical\nImperative, the logical ought, as expressed by, e.g., the law\nof non-contradiction, is rarely correctly obeyed in the real world by\nfinite flawed thinkers like us, who commit logical fallacies and moral\nsins with comparable frequency: sadly, ought does not entail\nis. Still, as non-naturalistic, Kant\u2019s pure general\nlogic is irreducible to all contingent facts and especially to all\nempirical psychological facts; hence his logic is thoroughly\nanti-psychologistic, which exploits the flip-side of unconditional\nobligation, whether logical or moral: happily, is does not\nentail ought.\n\nKant\u2019s table of judgments lays out a (putatively) exhaustive\nlist of the different possible logical forms of propositions under\nfour major headings, each major heading containing three sub-kinds, as\nfollows.\n\nTable of Judgments\n\nQuantity of Judgments: Universal, Particular, Singular.\nQuality: Affirmative, Negative, Infinite\nRelation: Categorical, Hypothetical, Disjunctive\nModality: Problematic, Assertoric, Apodictic (A70/B95)\n\n\n\nConsistently with Kant\u2019s \u201cprivileging of\npredication,\u201d it is arguable that his logical forms are all\neither modifications or else truth-functional compounds of simple\nmonadic (i.e.,1-place) categorical (i.e., subject-predicate)\npropositions of the general form \u201cFs are\nGs.\u201d\n\nIn this way, e.g., the three kinds of quantity of judgments\nare supposed by Kant to capture the three basic ways in which the\ncomprehensions of the two constituent concepts of a simple monadic\ncategorical proposition are logically combined and separated. So Kant\nsays that universal judgments are of the form \u201cAll Fs\nare Gs\u201d; that particular judgments are of the form\n\u201cSome Fs are Gs\u201d; and that singular\njudgments are of the form \u201cThis F is G\u201d\nor \u201cThe F is G.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the three kinds of quality of judgments are\nsupposed by Kant to capture the three basic ways in which the\nconstituent concepts of a simple monadic categorical judgment can be\neither existentially posited or gesetzt, or else\nexistentially cancelled or aufhebe, by respectively assigning\nnon-empty actual extensions to concepts, or null actual extensions to\nconcepts (A594\u2013595/622\u2013623). So Kant says that affirmative\njudgments are of the form \u201cit is the case that Fs are\nGs\u201d (or more simply: \u201cFs are\nGs\u201d), negative judgments are of the form \u201cno\nFs are Gs\u201d; and infinite judgments are of the\nform \u201cFs are non-Gs.\u201d\n\nBy contrast again, the three kinds of relation of judgments\nare supposed by Kant to capture the three basic ways in which simple\n1-place subject-predicate propositions can be either atomic\n(elementary) or molecular (compound) in respect of their truth-values.\nSo Kant says that categorical judgments repeat the simple atomic\n1-place subject-predicate form \u201cFs are\nGs\u201d; molecular hypothetical judgments are of the form\n\u201cIf Fs are Gs, then Hs are\nIs\u201d (or: \u201cIf P then Q\u201d);\nand molecular disjunctive judgments are of the form \u201cFs\nare either Gs or Hs or \u2026\u201d (where each\npartition of the total domain is mutually exclusive and the total set\nof partitions is exhaustive).\n\nBy contrast yet again and finally, the three kinds of\nmodality of a judgment are supposed by Kant to capture the\nthree basic ways in which the copula of a simple 1-place\nsubject-predicate proposition \u201ccontributes nothing to the\ncontent of the judgment \u2026 but rather concerns only the value of\nthe copula in relation to thinking in general\u201d\n(A74/B99\u2013100). This doctrine might seem to confuse the three\npropositional attitudes of \u201copining\u201d (Meinen),\nepistemic belief, and certainty (A820\u2013823/B848\u2013851), as\ndiscussed in the supplementary document\n Judging, Believing, and Scientific Knowing,\n with the alethic modal notions of possibility, actuality, and\nnecessity. Or even worse, it might seem to psychologize modality.\n\nAnd this in turn raises in a pointed way a general difficulty in the\ncommon interpretation of Kant\u2019s theory of judgment: the tendency\nto hold that his logic and theory of judgment are at bottom\nepistemological or empirical psychological theories. But this common\ninterpretation, as specifically applied to Kant\u2019s view of the\nmodality of judgments, should be rejected for four reasons. First, he\nexplicitly isolates and discusses propositional attitudes in the\ncontext of his epistemology of judgment and his ethics of belief, so\nit is obvious that he does not confuse logical modality with\npropositional attitudes. Second, he firmly rejects logical\npsychologism, as we have already seen. Third, the notion of\n\u201cvalue\u201d (Wert) here clearly means the\ntruth-value of a whole proposition, not its propositional\ncontent specifically, which explains why a modal predicate\n\u201ccontributes nothing to the content of a judgment,\u201d i.e.,\nit contributes nothing to the specific content of a judgment\nover and above its truth-value. Fourth and most importantly, the\nnotion of \u201cthinking in general\u201d for Kant is the conceptual\nequivalent of Leibnizian logically possible worlds (Bxvii n.,\nA573/B601). Thus the three kinds of modality of a judgment for Kant\nare, at bottom, the three basic ways in which truth can be assigned to\nsimple 1-place subject-predicate propositions, or to non-categorical\nsentential propositions, across logically possible\nworlds\u2014whether to some worlds (possibility), to this world alone\n(actuality, as essentially indexically determined by human sensory\nintuition/non-conceptual cognition), or to all worlds (necessity). So\nKant says that problematic judgments are of the form \u201cPossibly,\nFs are Gs\u201d (or: \u201cPossibly\nP\u201d); assertoric judgments are of the form\n\u201cActually, Fs are Gs\u201d (or:\n\u201cActually P\u201d); and apodictic judgments are of the\nform \u201cNecessarily, Fs are Gs\u201d (or:\n\u201cNecessarily P\u201d).\n\nSee the supplementary document:\n\nDo the Apparent Limitations and Confusions of Kant\u2019s Logic Undermine his Theory of Judgment?\n\n2.2 Kinds of propositional content\n\nFor Kant, as we have seen, the propositional content of a judgment is\nmore basic than its logical form. The propositional content of a\njudgment, in turn, can vary along at least three different dimensions:\n(1) its relation to sensory content, (2) its relation to the\ntruth-conditions of propositions, and (3) its relation to the\nconditions for objective validity.\n2.2.1 A priori judgments and a posteriori judgments\n\nThe notion of \u201ccognitive content\u201d for Kant has two sharply\ndistinct senses: (i) intension or Inhalt, which is objective\nand representational (semantic content); and (ii) sensory matter or\nMaterie, which is subjective and non-representational,\nreflecting only the immediate conscious response of the mind to the\nexternal impressions or inputs that trigger the operations of the\nfaculty of sensibility (phenomenal qualitative content)\n(A19\u201320/B34, A320/B376). To be sure, for Kant just as for the\nEmpiricists, all cognition \u201cbegins with\u201d (mit \u2026\nanfange) the raw data of sensory impressions. But in a crucial\ndeparture from Empiricism and towards what might be called a\nmitigated rationalism, Kant also holds that not all cognition\n\u201carises from\u201d (entspringt \u2026 aus) sensory\nimpressions: so for him, a significant and unique contribution to both\nthe form and the objective representational content of cognition\narises from the innate spontaneous cognitive capacities (B1). This\nnotion of cognition\u2019s \u201carising from\u201d either sensory\nimpressions or innate spontaneous cognitive capacities can best be\nconstrued as a strict determination relation (similar to what is\nnowadays called \u201cstrong supervenience\u201d) such that\nX strictly determines Y if and only if the\nX-features of something are sufficient for its\nY-features, and there cannot be a change in anything\u2019s\nY-features without a corresponding change in its\nX-features. This allows us to say that a cognition is a\nposteriori, empirical, or dependent on sensory impressions and/or\ncontingent natural objects or facts just in case it is strictly\ndetermined in its form or in its semantic content by sensory\nimpressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts; but a\ncognition is a priori, non-empirical, or absolutely independent of\nall sensory impressions and/or contingent natural objects or\nfacts just in case it is not strictly determined in its form or\nin its semantic content by sensory impressions and/or contingent\nnatural objects or facts and is instead strictly determined in its\nform or in its semantic content by our innate spontaneous cognitive\nfaculties (B2\u20133). It should be noted that the apriority of a\ncognition in this sense is perfectly consistent with all sorts of\nassociated sensory impressions and also with the actual presence of\nsensory matter in that cognition, caused by contingent natural objects\nor facts, so long as neither the form nor the semantic content is\nstrictly determined by those sensory impressions and/or contingent\nnatural objects or facts. \u201cPure\u201d a priori cognitions are\nthose that in addition to being a priori or absolutely independent of\nall sensory impressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts,\nalso contain no sensory matter whatsoever (B3). So in other words,\nsome but not all a priori cognitions are pure.\n\nApplying these notions to judgments, it follows that a judgment is a\nposteriori if and only if either its logical form or its propositional\ncontent is strictly determined by sensory impressions and/or\ncontingent natural objects or facts; and a judgment is a priori if and\nonly if neither its logical form nor its propositional content is\nstrictly determined by sensory impressions and/or contingent natural\nobjects or facts, and both are instead strictly determined by our\ninnate spontaneous cognitive faculties, whether or not that cognition\nalso contains sensory matter. Kant also holds that a judgment is a\npriori if and only if it is necessarily true (Axv, B3\u20134,\nA76/B101). This strong connection between necessity and apriority\nexpresses (i) Kant\u2019s view that the contingency of a judgment is\nbound up with the modal dependence of its semantic content on sensory\nimpressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts, i.e., its\naposteriority (B3), (ii) his view that necessity is equivalent with\nstrict universality or strenge Allgemeinheit, which he\ndefines in turn as a proposition\u2019s lack of any possible\ncounterexamples or falsity-makers (B4), and (iii) his view that\nnecessity entails truth (A75\u201376/B100\u2013101). Furthermore\nKant explicitly holds that not only do a priori judgments really exist\nin various sciences, including physics and legitimate (i.e.,\ntranscendental idealist) metaphysics, but also that there really are\nsome pure a priori judgments, e.g., in mathematics\n(B4\u20135, B14\u201318).\n2.2.2 Analytic judgments and synthetic judgments\n\nKant\u2019s distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is\nthe historical origin of, and therefore significantly related to,\nbut\u2014crucially\u2014not precisely equivalent, either in\nintension or extension, with the nowadays more familiar\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, according to which (1) analyticity is\ntruth by virtue of linguistic meaning alone, exclusive of empirical\nfacts, (2) syntheticity is truth by virtue of empirical facts, and (3)\nthe necessary statement vs. contingent statement distinction is\nformally and materially equivalent to the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. By 1950 this more familiar distinction was accepted as\ngospel truth by virtually all analytic philosophers: but in the two\ndecades after the publication of W.V.O. Quine\u2019s iconoclastic\n\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d in 1951 (Quine 1961), it was\ngradually replaced by the new-and-improved post-Quinean gospel truth\nthat there is no such thing as an acceptable analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. This plain historical fact is closely related to the\nhighly regrettable further fact that Kant\u2019s analytic-synthetic\ndistinction is nowadays often wrongly interpreted (i) in terms of the\nmore familiar and now largely discredited analytic-synthetic\ndistinction, and also (ii) as reducible to an epistemic distinction\nbetween uninformatively or trivially true a priori judgments and\ninformative judgments. Ironically Frege, the father or grandfather of\nanalytic philosophy, was much nearer the mark in the Foundations\nof Arithmetic when he correctly construed Kant\u2019s theory of\nanalyticity semantically, as a theory about necessary\ninternal relations between concepts; although at the same time he not\nquite so correctly said that Kantian analyticity boils down to\n\u201csimply taking out of the box again what we have just put into\nit\u201d (Frege 1953, 101). Frege\u2019s 19th century\ncharacterization of Kantian analyticity, it turns out, has significant\nparallels with the 18th century Leibnizian and Wolffian theories of\nconceptual and/or logical truth that heavily influenced Kant\u2019s\nwork on analyticity (Anderson 2015). Backing away now from Frege and\nthe Leibniz-Wolff tradition, however, the crucial fact is that\nKant\u2019s analytic-synthetic distinction concerns two irreducibly\ndifferent kinds of semantic content within objectively valid\npropositions (Hanna 2001, chs. 3\u20134), and this distinction is\nneither primarily epistemic in character (although it does have some\nimportant epistemic implications [Hanna 2006b, 362\u2013379]) nor\ndoes it specifically concern the logical form of judgments (4:\n266).\n\nFrege regarded Kant\u2019s notion of analyticity as trivial; and,\ncorrespondingly, it is also true that if the Leibniz-Wolff approach to\nconceptual and/or logical truth largely determined Kant\u2019s theory\nof analyticity, then Kant\u2019s notion of analyticity is\nimpoverished (Anderson 2015). But on the contrary Kant\u2019s notion\nof analyticity is substantive, by virtue of five important ideas:\nfirst, Kant\u2019s pro-Leibnizian idea that all concepts\nhave intensional microstructures, or what he calls \u201clogical\nessences\u201d or \u201cconceptual essences\u201d (9: 61); second,\nhis anti-Leibnizian idea that logically possible worlds are\nnothing but maximal logically consistent sets of concepts, not\nthings-in-themselves (A571\u2013573/B599\u2013601); third, his\nreferentialist idea that all grammatically well-formed,\nsortally correct, and logically consistent concepts have non-empty\ncross-possible-worlds extensions (a.k.a. \u201ccomprehensions\u201d)\n(A239/B298\u2013299) (9: 95\u201396); fourth, his semantic\nrestrictionist idea that all and only objectively valid\npropositions have truth-values; and fifth, finally, and most\nimportantly, his logical analyticity idea that the notion of\nanalyticity covers not only the so-called \u201ccontainment\u201dof\npredicate-concepts in subject-concepts in categorical propositions,\nand not only the intensional identity of subject-concepts and\npredicate-concepts, but also all the logical truths of\ntruth-functional logic and monadic predicate logic. Then for Kant a\njudgment is analytic if and only if its propositional content is\nnecessarily true either by virtue of necessary internal relations\nbetween its objectively valid conceptual microstructures and/or its\nconceptual comprehensions, or by virtue of its truth-functional\nlogical connectives, or by virtue of its monadic predicate logical\nconnectives (Hanna 2001, ch. 3), leaving open the question of whether\nfor Kant all logical connectives are strictly truth-functional. In any\ncase, let this be repeated with strong emphasis: Kant does\nnot define analyticity in terms of either the containment or\nthe identity of concepts, which are at best sufficient conditions for\nanalyticity and not also necessary conditions for\nanalyticity. On the contrary, Kant explicitly states a universal,\nnecessary, and sufficient semantic criterion for the truth of analytic\njudgments, namely that a judgment is analytically true if and only if\nits denial entails a contradiction, in a broad sense of\n\u201centailment\u201d that includes intensional entailment and not\nmerely classical deductive entailment (A151/B190\u2013191). This\ncriterion also directly connects the notion of an analytic\ntruth with the notion of a logical truth in a\ncorrespondingly broad sense that fully includes the tautologies and\nvalid sentences of truth-functional logic and monadic predicate logic,\nbut is neither restricted to nor reducible to (with the addition of\n\u201clogical definitions\u201d [Frege 1953], whatever they\nactually turn out to be on Frege\u2019s account, which is not at all\nclear [Benacerraf 1981]) the truth-functional tautologies and valid\nsentences of classical polyadic predicate logic.\n\nNeedless to say, however, if one holds that the Kantian definition of\nanalyticity is truth-in-virtue-of-containment, and also that the\nKantian definition of syntheticity is\ntruth-in-virtue-of-non-containment, together with a Kantian\nconceptualist view of the nature of judgment, then one\u2019s\nconception of Kant\u2019s analytic and synthetic judgments will be\ncorrespondingly different (Anderson 2004, Anderson 2005, Anderson\n2009, Anderson 2015).\n\nBut what about syntheticity? Since for Kant the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction is exhaustive in the sense that every proposition is\neither analytic or synthetic but not both, his two-part doctrine of\nanalyticity in turn provides him with a two-part negative doctrine of\nsyntheticity: A proposition is synthetic if and only if its truth is\nnot strictly determined by relations between its conceptual\nmicrostructures or conceptual comprehensions alone, or by\ntruth-functional logic or monadic predicate logic alone (which for\nKant is expressively captured by the table of judgments and the table\nof pure concepts of the understanding); and a judgment is\nsynthetically true if and only if it is true and its denial does\nnot entail a contradiction. But this negative\ncharacterization of course does not tell us what the truth of\nsynthetic judgments positively consists in. In order to do this, Kant\ndirectly connects the semantics of syntheticity with the semantics of\nintuitions, just as he directly connects the semantics of analyticity\nwith the semantics of concepts (including both empirical concepts and\nthe pure concepts of the understanding). Then positively put, a\njudgment is synthetic if and only if its meaning and its truth are\nstrictly determined by its constituent intuitions, whether empirical\nintuitions or pure intuitions (A8, A154\u2013155/B193\u2013194,\nA721/B749) (8: 245) (11: 38). This is not to say either that synthetic\njudgments do not contain any concepts (in fact they always do\ncontain empirical or pure concepts), or even that the conceptual\ncomponents of a synthetic judgment are irrelevant to its meaning or\ntruth (in fact empirical or pure concepts always are\nsemantically relevant), but only to say that in a synthetic judgment\nit is the intuitional components that strictly determine its\nmeaning and truth, not its empirical-conceptual or pure-conceptual\ncomponents. In short, a synthetic judgment is an intuition-based\nproposition.\n2.2.3 Synthetic a priori judgments\n\nEvery reader of the Critique of Pure Reason knows that Kant\nglosses his philosophical project in that book as a complete and\nsystematic answer to the question, \u201chow are synthetic a\npriori judgments possible?\u201d (B19). Also every reader of the\nfirst Critique knows that Kant asserts the existence of\nsynthetic a priori judgments in mathematics, physics, and metaphysics\n(B14\u201318, A158/B197). But fewer readers are aware that this\nassertion, whether right or wrong, is certainly the boldest and\nperhaps also the most important claim in post-Cartesian metaphysics.\nThis is because it posits the thesis of modal dualism, or the\nclaim that there are two irreducibly different basic types of\nnecessary truth, in the face of the almost universally-held\ncounter-thesis of modal monism, or the claim that there is\none and only basic type of necessary truth, i.e., analytically or\nlogically necessary truth. Given Kant\u2019s theory of truth, modal\ndualism also implies the worldly existence of two irreducibly\ndifferent types of modal facts as truth-makers for analytically and\nsynthetically necessary truths respectively. In short if Kant is\nright, then there are fundamentally more things in heaven and earth\nthan modal monists are prepared to acknowledge. Moreover Kant holds\nthat all the basic statements of traditional metaphysics are, at least\nin intention, synthetic a priori judgments (B18). Hence his famous\ncritique of traditional metaphysics in the Transcendental Dialectic is\nnothing but a deepened and extended investigation of the possibility\nof synthetic a priori judgments.\n\nBut what is a synthetic a priori judgment? Combining the a\npriori-a posteriori distinction with the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction, Kant derives four possible kinds of judgment: (1)\nanalytic a priori, (2) analytic a posteriori, (3) synthetic a priori,\nand (4) synthetic a posteriori. By virtue of the fact that analytic\njudgments are necessarily true, and given Kant\u2019s thesis that\nnecessity entails apriority, it follows that all analytic judgments\nare a priori and that there is no such thing as an analytic a\nposteriori judgment. By contrast, synthetic judgments can be either a\npriori or a posteriori. Synthetic a posteriori judgments are\nempirical, contingent judgments, although they may vary widely as to\ntheir degree of generality. Synthetic a priori judgments, by contrast,\nare non-empirical, non-contingent judgments.\n\nMore precisely however, synthetic a priori judgments have three\nessential features. First, because a synthetic a priori judgment is a\npriori, its meaning and truth are strictly underdetermined by sensory\nimpressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts, and it is also\nnecessarily true. Second, because a synthetic a priori judgment is\nsynthetic, not analytic, its truth is not determined by\nconceptual/truth-functional-logical/monadic-predicate-logical factors\nalone, and its denial is logically consistent. Third, as is the case\nwith all synthetic judgments, the meaning and truth of a synthetic a\npriori judgment is intuition-based. This third factor is the crucial\none. For while the meaning and truth of synthetic a posteriori\njudgments is based on empirical intuitions, the\nmeaning and truth of synthetic a priori judgments is based on pure\nintuitions or our a priori formal representations of space and\ntime (B73) (8: 245) (11: 38). Now since according to Kant our a priori\nformal representations of space and time are both necessary conditions\nof the possibility of human experience and also necessary\nconditions of the objective validity or empirical meaningfulness of\njudgments, which in turn confers truth-valuedness upon propositions,\nit then follows that a synthetic a priori judgment is a proposition\nthat is true in all and only the humanly experienceable possible\nworlds and truth-valueless otherwise (Hanna 2001, 239\u2013245). By\nsharp contrast, analytic judgments, as logical truths in either a\nnarrow (truth-functional or syllogistic) or broad (intensional logic)\nsense, are true in all logically possible worlds, including those\nlogically possible worlds in which human experience is not\npossible, i.e., the worlds containing non-phenomenal or non-apparent\nentities, especially including things-in-themselves, i.e., the\n\u201cnoumenal worlds.\u201d\n\nSo analytic and synthetic a priori judgments sharply differ not only\nin the nature of their semantic content (i.e.,\nconcept-based/truth-functional-logic-based/monadic-predicate-logic-based\nvs. intuition-based) but also in their modal scope (true in all\nlogically possible worlds vs. true in all and only humanly\nexperienceable worlds and truth-valueless otherwise). Nevertheless,\ndespite this sharp difference in modal scope\u2014from which it\nfollows, perhaps surprisingly, that for Kant there are logically\npossible worlds in which synthetic a priori propositions such as\n\u201c7+5=12\u201d are thinkably deniable\u2014since synthetic a\npriori judgments are either true or truth-valueless in every\nlogically possible world, it also follows that they are never\nfalse in any logically possible world and thus satisfy\nKant\u2019s general definition of a necessary truth, i.e., that a\nproposition is necessary if and only if it is strictly universally\ntrue, in that it is true in every member of a complete class of\npossible worlds and has no possible counterexamples or falsity-makers\n(Hanna 2001, ch. 5). Less abstractly and gallumphingly put, a\nsynthetic a priori judgment is a necessary truth with a human\nface.\n\nIn the discussion so far, judgments are essentially identified with\ntheir propositional contents. But according to Kant it is also\npossible for a rational cognizer to use the very same\npropositional content in different ways. The fundamental difference in\nuses of judgments is between (a) theoretical judgments and (b)\nnon-theoretical judgments. But there are also some crucial differences\nbetween theoretical uses of judgments. For a discussion of these kinds\nof use, see the following supplementary document:\n\nKinds of Use\n\n3. The Metaphysics of Judgment: Transcendental Idealism\n\nThere is a very real sense in which Kant\u2019s positive metaphysics\nin the Critique of Pure Reason is essentially an elaboration\nof his theory of judgment: \u201cit is not at all [traditional]\nmetaphysics that the Critique is doing but a whole new\nscience, never before attempted, namely the critique of an a priori\njudging reason\u201d (10: 340). This results directly from the\nconjunction of the centrality thesis and the transcendental idealism\nthesis: judgment is the central cognitive activity of the human mind,\nand judgments are objectively valid and true if and only if the\nmetaphysics of transcendental idealism is correct. In this section,\nthe crucial connection between judgment and transcendental idealism\nwill be spelled out in more detail.\n3.1 Judgment, transcendental idealism, and truth\n\nTranscendental idealism is the conjunction of two theses: (1)\ncognitive idealism, which says that all the proper objects of\nhuman cognition are nothing but mind-dependent sensory appearances or\nphenomena, not things-in-themselves or noumena (A369), and (2)\nrepresentational transcendentalism , which says that all\nrepresentations and their contents necessarily conform to the forms or\nstructures of our innate spontaneous cognitive capacities (Bxvi,\nA11/B25) (4: 373 n.). There are weaker and stronger interpretations of\nthese theses (see, e.g., Allais 2015), but in any case transcendental\nidealism in its strongest version directly entails that all\nthe objects of human experience are token-identical with\nobjectively-valid sensory representational contents:\n\nYou put the matter quite precisely when you say The content\n(Innbegriff) of a representation is itself the object; and\nthe activity of the mind whereby the content of a representation is\nrepresented is what is meant by \u2018referring to the object. (11:\n314)\n\n\nLonguenesse aptly dubs this Kantian thesis \u201cthe internalization\nto representation of the object of representation\u201d (Longuenesse\n1998, 20, 108). But perhaps even more importantly, Kant\u2019s\n\u201cinternalization to representation of the object of\nrepresentation\u201d entails that all the basic phenomenal forms or\nstructures of those objects of experience are type-identical with the\nforms or structures introduced into representations by the innately\npre-programmed spontaneous operations of our cognitive faculties, and\nin particular with the spatiotemporal structures of our subjective\nforms of sensory intuition. Indeed, Kant explicitly holds that space\nand time are nothing but our subjective forms of intuition,\nwhich is his controversial thesis of \u201cthe transcendental\nideality of space and time\u201d (A28\u201330/B44\u201345,\nA36/B52\u201353, A42\u201343/B59\u201360). The upshot is that\naccording to the strongest version of transcendental idealism, all the\nobjects of human experience are nothing but what we represent them\nto be, when we represent sensory objects according to the a priori\nnormative principles of our understanding and our reason: so our\ncognition does not conform to the objects we cognize, rather those\nobjects necessarily conform to our innate a priori\nnormatively-governed faculties of cognition (Bxvi,\nA92/B125\u2013126).\n\nNow assume that this strongest version of transcendental idealism is\ncorrect. Then add to this assumption Kant\u2019s centrality thesis,\nto the effect that judgment is the central human cognitive faculty,\nand also the priority-of-the-proposition thesis. It follows\nimmediately that all the objects of human experience are\ntoken-identical with the propositional contents of objectively\nvalid empirical judgments, and also that all the basic phenomenal\nforms or structures of objects of human experience are type-identical\nwith the spatiotemporal and logico-syntactic and logico-semantic forms\nor structures that are inherent in the propositional contents of\nempirical judgments, which we can now see to be forms or structures\nthat have been introduced directly into nature by the acts of the\ncognitive faculties of sensibility, imagination, understanding,\napperception, and reason, which are all brought together and fused\nin the unifying act of judgment or thought . In short, the\nstrongest version of Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism is also a\njudgment-based idealism, according to which actual or\nnon-actual/merely possible empirical objects or states-of-affairs are\nnothing but true or false empirical propositions, and according to\nwhich the basic phenomenal contours of the world we cognize are\nprecisely the same as the innate intuitional, formal-syntactic, and\nsemantic contours of the several cognitive faculties that jointly\ngenerate our judgments.\n\nKant\u2019s judgment-based idealism has some crucial consequences for\nhis theory of truth. If the strongest version of transcendental\nidealism is correct, then to every true empirical judgment there\nnecessarily corresponds an actual empirical fact, and conversely, and\nalso to every true a priori judgment there necessarily corresponds\nsome objectively real conceptually-represented or\nintuitionally-represented structure across a complete set of logically\nor experientially possible worlds. What this means is that whereas\nKant\u2019s theory of truth is explicitly realistic at the empirical\nlevel\u2014which is what he calls his \u201cempirical realism\u201d\n(A28/B44, A35/B52, A370\u2013373)\u2014in that actual empirical\nfacts or modal facts (whether these are conceptually-represented\nlogical world-structures or intuitionally-represented non-logical\nworld-structures) always present themselves as in some irreducible\nrespects external or extrinsic to our cognition, and therefore not\ncontrolled by us, nevertheless at the transcendental level his theory\nof truth is fully anti-realistic: transcendentally speaking, we\nimpose truth upon the world . In short, the strongest version\nof transcendental idealism plus the centrality thesis plus the\npriority-of-the-proposition thesis jointly necessarily\nguarantee that all and only the cognitively well-generated judgments\nare true. This is what Kant calls the \u201ctranscendental\ntruth\u201d of judgments (A146/B185). Transcendental falsity, by\ncontrast, is always the result of some special idiosyncrasy or\naccidental glitch in the cognitive generation of a given judgment, and\nthus represents a mere \u201cperformance error\u201d in the\noperation of our cognitive faculties, and not a gap in our\ntranscendental cognitive \u201ccompetence.\u201d Thus any sort of\nserious skepticism at the transcendental level of Kant\u2019s theory\nof judgment is automatically ruled out of court.\n3.2 Is Kant a verificationist?\n\nOne important critical question that needs to be raised is whether, in\nview of the strongest version of his transcendental idealism,\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment is reductionist in some basic\nrespects, and in particular whether he reduces the meaning or\npropositional content of a judgment to a rule for confirming or\ndisconfirming the assertion of that propositional content in the\ntribunal of sensory experience. This is of course the thesis of\nverificationism. Several important Kant commentators\u2014e.g., Bird\n1962, Strawson 1966, and Stroud 1968\u2014have held that Kant\u2019s\ntheory of judgment is verificationist. Familiar problems with\nverificationism include its susceptibility to epistemic skepticism,\nits commitment to an implausible coherence theory of truth, and\nspecific difficulties about how to confirm or disconfirm judgments\nabout the non-immediate past or future.\n\nIt cannot be denied that there are some verificationist strands in\nKant\u2019s theory. For one thing, his \u201ccriterion of empirical\ntruth\u201d (see Section 1.3 above) is in effect verificationist.\nMoreover, to the extent that both Kant\u2019s theory of\ntranscendental truth and also his verificationism are anti-realist and\njudgment-based, there is at least an elective affinity if not\nprecisely an equivalence between the two doctrines. Nevertheless, Kant\nis not a reductionist about meaning. In other words, he is not\ncommitted to the thesis that the propositional content of a judgment\nis nothing but a rule for confirming or disconfirming the\nassertion of that propositional content in the tribunal of sensory\nexperience. While he does seem to be committed to the thesis that the\npropositional content of a judgment will be empirically meaningful or\nobjectively valid only if it contains a rule for confirming\nor disconfirming the assertion of that propositional content in the\ntribunal of sensory experience, this does not by any means exhaust the\npropositional content of that judgment. Over and above its\nverificationist element, the propositional content of every judgment\nalso contains a \u201cthick\u201d or non-deflationary\ncorrespondence-relation to relatively external or extrinsic actual\nfacts (see Section 1.3 above). Furthermore the propositional content\nof every judgment contains a set of a priori logical forms deriving\nfrom the pure understanding, as well as a higher-order a priori\nrational subjective unity deriving from the faculty for apperception\nor rational self-consciousness (see Section 2.1.1 above). What this\nmeans is that Kant is at most a weak verificationist, and that the\nverificationist elements of his theory of judgment are significantly\ntempered by his semantic non-reductionism, his empirical realism, and\nhis mitigated rationalism.\n\nA more complete picture of Kant\u2019s metaphysics of judgment is\nobtained by sketching in accounts of judgments of experience and\ntranscendental judgments. These are discussed in the following\nsupplementary document:\n\nCompleting the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment\n\n4. Problems and Prospects\n\nThe basic parts of Kant\u2019s theory of judgment are now all in\nplace. In this concluding section, we will look briefly at several\nserious problems for Kant\u2019s theory. These problems, which come\nto a head in the debate about Kant\u2019s conceptualism vs.\nKant\u2019s non-conceptualism (see the supplementary document\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism),\n all ultimately stem from the interplay between either the centrality\nthesis or the priority-of-the-proposition thesis, and the\ntranscendental ideality thesis. This in turn suggests that the other\ntwo parts of Kant\u2019s theory can be logically detached from his\ntranscendental idealism and defended independently of it.\n4.1 The bottom-up problem: essentially non-conceptual intuitions, rogue objects, and the gap in the B Deduction\n\nWhat can be called the bottom-up problem for Kant\u2019s\nmetaphysics of judgment follows directly from his non-conceptualism\n(see the supplement\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism),\n and exposes a fundamental gap in the B Deduction. In our discussion\nof the B Deduction (see the supplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment)\n it was noted that Kant\u2019s argument for the objective validity of\nthe categories will go through only if all the objects of human\nintuition are necessarily also objects of human experience,\nthat is, are necessarily also objects correctly represented\nby true judgments of experience, that is, are necessarily\nalso objects falling under all of the categories, or at the\nvery least under the principle of the Second Analogy of Experience,\nwhich provides the criterion of the objectivity of objects of\nexperience. But if this claim fails, then there can in principle be\nnomologically ill-behaved or \u201crogue\u201d objects of human\nintuition that fall outside the scope of judgments of experience and\nthus also outside the categories, or at least outside the scope of the\nSecond Analogy. As several Kant-interpreters have pointed out, given\nthe possibility of essentially non-conceptual intuitions, then the B\nDeduction is in big trouble (Kitcher 1990, Hanna 2016b). More\nprecisely, Kant\u2019s non-conceptualism entails that there can be\nobjectively valid empirical intuitions that are both autonomous from\nand also independent of concepts, and thereby directly refer to\nobjects. Since the cognition of these objects does not require either\nconcepts or the faculty of understanding, and since these intuitions\nconsciously represent objects over and above any conceptual content\nwhatsoever, then some of these intuitions can pick out rogue objects\nthat fall outside the constraints of all the categories, and thereby\noutside the constraints of the Second Analogy in particular. So it is\nnot true that the categories and principles of pure understanding\nnecessarily apply to all objects of conscious human\nperception, and the categorial anarchy of at least some sensory\nobjects is really possible. Therefore the B Deduction is unsound. \n4.2 The top-down problem: judgment, transcendental affinity, and the systematic unity of nature\n\nThe bottom-up problem has a metaphysical mirror-image, which can be\ncalled the top-down problem. This problem afflicts\nKant\u2019s transcendental doctrine of judgment, and consequently\nalso his theory of the principles of pure understanding (see the\nsupplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment).\n The worry here is simply that even allowing for the transcendental\nschematism of the judgment, there is still no absolute guarantee that\na given universal transcendental principle or transcendental concept\nof the understanding, construed as a rule for ordering sensory\nappearances or sensory objects, has been completely applied\nto sensory appearances or objects. In other words, even allowing for\nhis transcendental doctrine of the judgment, Kant has not given us\ngood reason to think that there cannot be any sensory appearances or\nobjects that fail to be subsumed under the transcendental principles\nof nature. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant calls the\nspecifically causal-law-governed or nomological interconnection of all\nsensory appearances or objects under transcendental principles the\n\u201ctranscendental affinity\u201dof the sensory manifold of\nintuitions (A114). In the A edition of the first Critique, Kant\nasserts that if the categories are objectively valid, then the\ntranscendental affinity of the manifold automatically follows. Then,\nassuming the strongest version of transcendental idealism, he further\nasserts that from transcendental affinity, an \u201cempirical\naffinity\u201d of the sensory manifold of intuitions also directly\nfollows (A115). Now since empirical affinity is the complete\napplication to actual empirical nature of the system of causal laws\nunder transcendental principles, it follows that empirical affinity is\nthe same as the systematic unity of nature. So Kant is saying\nthat the systematic unity of nature is a trivial consequence of\ntranscendental affinity.\n\nIn the first Critique\u2019s Appendix to the Transcendental\nDialectic however, Kant quietly but very significantly backtracks on\nthis crucial point and treats the principle of the systematic unity of\nnature as stemming only from a regulative but not a\nconstitutive use of judgment, although this principle is also asserted\nto have some sort of transcendental force (see the supplement\n Kinds of Use).\n Then in the first Introduction to the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, Kant explicitly says that\n\n[it] is quite possible in itself (at least as far as the understanding\ncan make out a priori), [that] the multiplicity of these [empirical]\nlaws, along with the natural forms corresponding to them, being\ninfinitely great, [could] \u2026 present to us a raw chaotic\naggregate and not the least trace of a system, even though we must\npresuppose such a system in accordance with transcendental laws. (20:\n209)\n\n\nIn other words, now Kant is saying that the transcendental affinity of\nthe manifold does not entail an empirical affinity of the\nmanifold or the systematic unity of nature. To be sure, in the third\nCritique, he also explicitly ties together the principle of\nsystematic unity with the regulative use of reflective judgments of\ntaste, and says that it is a subjectively necessary transcendental\nprinciple presupposed by legitimate judgments of taste (see the\nsupplement\n Kinds of Use).\n But if the principle of systematic unity is only subjectively and not\nin fact objectively necessary, then Kant has not\nshown us that the system of causal laws of nature must be\ncompletely applied to sensory appearances or objects. Rather he has\nshown only that we must epistemically believe it to be\ncompletely applied to sensory appearances or objects. So there remains\nthe real possibility of relatively or absolutely chaotic aggregates of\nsensory appearances or objects that are not subsumed or even in\nprinciple cannot be subsumed under the transcendental affinity of the\nmanifold, i.e., the real possibility of the categorial anarchy of\nrogue objects. In other words, for all that Kant has argued, and by\nhis own reckoning, even assuming transcendental affinity there might\nstill be no complete application of transcendental laws to nature. So\nthe transcendental schematism of the pure concepts is insufficient to\nbridge the gap between categories and sensory appearances, and the\ntranscendental doctrine of judgment fails.\n4.3 The dream-skeptical problem: judgment, problematic idealism, and the gap in the Second Analogy\n\nAs we saw in the supplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment,\n the Second Analogy of Experience, if true, guarantees both the\nobjectivity and the universal diachronic or temporally successive\ncausal necessitation of objects of experience and all of their parts,\nunder natural laws. As we also saw in Section 1.3, the\n\u201ccriterion of empirical truth\u201d for a judgment of\nexperience says that since the objectively valid propositional content\nof an empirical judgment can be specified as a necessary conceptual\nrule of sensory appearances or objects, then if that rule is\neffectively applied to the temporal succession of our sensory\nrepresentations of the phenomenal material world, and that\nrule coheres with the causal-dynamic laws of nature, then\nthat judgment is true. And finally, as we also saw in Section 3.1, the\ncentrality thesis, the priority-of-the-proposition thesis, and the\ntranscendental idealism thesis jointly entail the\n\u201ctranscendental truth\u201d of judgment, which is that\nnecessarily every well-generated judgment of experience is true and\ncorresponds to an actual object of experience, that is, to an actual\nempirical fact.\n\nBut here is a simple objection to this three-part doctrine, borrowed\nfrom Descartes\u2019s famous \u201cdream skepticism\u201d in the\nfirst of the Meditations on First Philosophy. Kant calls this\nform of skepticism \u201cproblematic idealism\u201d (B274). To\ngenerate the relevant version of problematic idealism, suppose that\nall the sensory appearances or objects currently falling under the\nSecond Analogy, the criterion of empirical truth, and the principle of\ntranscendental truth are nothing but causally well-ordered parts\nof my inner sense alone. Then any object of experience\ncorresponding to my currently true judgment of experience might be\nnothing but a very coherent dream or a hallucination. Nothing Kant has\nsaid can rule this out. Even the famous Refutation of Idealism in the\nfirst Critique, if sound, says only that \u201cinner\nexperience is possible only through outer experience in general\u201d\n(B278\u2013279), and Kant explicitly concedes that at any given time,\nfor all we know, we could be dreaming or hallucinating:\n\nfrom the fact that the existence of outer objects is required for the\npossibility of a determinate consciousness of our self it does not\nfollow that every intuitive representation of outer things includes at\nthe same time their existence, for that may well be the mere effect of\nthe imagination (in dreams as well as delusions). (B278)\n\n\nSo even if inner experience and outer experience are necessarily\nconnected in general, the truth and objectivity of any\nparticular judgment of experience, by Kant\u2019s own\ncriteria for truth and objectivity, are consistent with the\npossibility that the particular object of experience corresponding to\nthat judgment is nothing but very coherent dream or a hallucination.\nAfter all, I can perfectly well dream or hallucinate a boat\ngoing downstream, as well as actually seeing one. It is true\nthat Kant does remark in the General Note on the System of Principles\nin the B edition of the first Critique that \u201cin order\nto understand the possibility of things in accordance with the\ncategories, and thus to establish the objective reality of the latter,\nwe do not merely need intuitions, but always outer intuitions\u201d\n(B291). This seems correct. But unfortunately, given what Kant says at\nB278, nothing in his transcendentally idealistic metaphysics of\njudgment will guarantee that any set of sensory appearances or objects\nsatisfying his criteria for the truth and objectivity of judgments of\nexperience on any particular occasion will in fact be material objects\nin space corresponding to outer intuitions, and not merely causally\nwell-ordered mental imagery corresponding to inner intuitions, i.e.,\nmere \u201cphantoms of my brain.\u201d So the Second Analogy\u2019s\ncriterion of objectivity is ultimately insufficient to yield the\nempirical truth of judgments of experience, despite Kant\u2019s\nexplicit claim that this criterion does yield both their objective\nvalidity and their empirical truth (A202/B247).\n4.4 Conclusion: judgment without strong transcendental idealism?\n\nAs we have seen in Sections 4.1 to 4.3, Kant\u2019s theory of\njudgment leads to at least three serious problems when it is taken in\nconjunction with the issue about his conceptualism vs. his\nnon-conceptualism (in the supplement\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism)\n and his metaphysics of strong transcendental idealism (Section 3.1\nand the supplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment).\n Does this mean his theory of judgment is philosophically unacceptable\nand at best an antiquarian curiosity of 18th century German\nphilosophy? No. This is because it seems very likely that the problems\nin Kant\u2019s theory of judgment are principally due to his\nconjoining the centrality thesis and the priority-of-the-proposition\nthesis with the thesis of transcendental idealism. But suppose that\nthe strongest version of transcendental idealism is false, and that\nthe transcendental idealism thesis is either logically detached from\nthe other two theses or else retained but instead based on a\nsignificantly weaker version of transcendental idealism (Hanna 2006b,\nch. 5): what remains? We are left with a general Kantian theory of\nhuman rationality that is essentially oriented towards judgment, and\nthen in turn with specific Kantian accounts of the nature of judgment\nand of the various irreducibly different kinds of judgment, that are\nessentially oriented towards the anthropocentric empirical\nmeaningfulness and truth of the proposition. As such, Kant\u2019s\ntheory of judgment is thoroughly cognitivist but also\nanti-psychologistic and anti-platonistic, and it thereby smoothly\ncombines the several \u201cfaces\u201d of judgment into a unified\ndoctrine. So the fact that Kantian non-conceptualism (see the\nsupplement\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism)\n makes serious trouble for the B Deduction (Section 4.1), together\nwith the further fact that the strongest version of transcendental\nidealism is very likely false\u2014since the unqualified\ntranscendental ideality thesis, when conjoined with the centrality\nthesis and the priority-of-the-proposition thesis, collectively entail\ncontradictions in Kant\u2019s theory that are not entailed by the\nconjunction of the other two theses alone\u2014do not ultimately\ncompromise the inherent philosophical interest, contemporary\nrelevance, and critical defensibility of the other basic parts of\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment.\n",
