The bold generalizer that conjectures that all ravens are\nblack after observing samples of only black ravens succeeds with at\nmost one mind change: if indeed all ravens are black, the generalizer\nnever changes its mind at all. And if there is a nonblack raven, the\nrefutation occasions one mind change, but afterwards the question is\nsettled.\n\nContrast this with the contrary method that asserts that there is a\nnonblack raven after observing a sample of all black ones. If only\nblack ravens continue to be observed, the contrary method has to\neventually change its mind and assert that \u201call ravens are\nblack\u201d, or else it fails to arrive at the correct\ngeneralization. But then at that point, a nonblack raven may appear,\nforcing a second mind change. Thus the goal of stable belief places\nstrong constraints on what a method may conjecture in the short run\nfor this problem: on observing only black ravens, the options are\n\u201call ravens are black\u201d or \u201cno opinion yet\u201d,\nbut not \u201cthere is a nonblack raven\u201d.\n\nIn the conservation law problem, the restrictive method described in\n Section 2.1\n is the only method that minimizes mind changes. Recall that the\nrestrictive method adopts a set of conservation laws that rule out as\nmany unobserved reactions as possible. It can be shown that if there\nare \\(n\\) known elementary particles whose reactions are observed,\nthis method requires at most \\(n\\) mind changes. (The number of\nelementary particles in the Standard Model is around \\(n = 200).\\)\n\nFor learning causal graphs, the following variant of the method\ndescribed in\n Section 2.2\n minimizes the number of mind changes.\n\nSuppose we have observed a set of correlations or associations\namong a set of variables of interest.\nIf there is a unique causal graph that explains the observed\ncorrelations with a minimum number of direct causal links,\nselect this graph.\nIf there is more than one causal graph that explains the observed\ncorrelations with a minimum number of direct causal links, output\n\u201cno opinion yet\u201d (or conjecture the disjunction of the\nminimum edge graphs).\n\n\nThis example illustrates that sometimes minimizing mind changes\nrequires withholding beliefs. Intuitively, this occurs when there are\ntwo or more equally simple explanations of the data, and the inquirer\nhas to wait until further observations decide between these\npossibilities. Jumping to one of the simple conclusions might lead to\nan unnecessary mind change in case an alternative equally simple\nexplanation turns out to be correct. In such cases there is a\ntrade-off between the goals of achieving stable belief, on the one\nhand, and quickly settling on a true belief on the other [Schulte\n1999]. We discuss the connection between simplicity and stable belief\nin the next section on simplicity.\n",
