    "main_text": "Temporal Consciousness and the Metaphysics of Time || Competing Conceptions of Time\n8.2 The Argument from Experience\n\nDoes the character of temporal experience have any implications for\nthe nature of time per se? Could the dynamism we encounter in\nour temporal experience be sign of temporal passage or even a product\nof it? Does it bolster the A-theorist by providing evidence that time\nreally does pass? Claims that the passage of time features in our\nexperience are not difficult to find.\n\n\nThe best reason to believe that time passes is simply that we\nfind passage, that we are immediately and poignantly involved\nin the jerk and whoosh of process, the felt flow of one moment into\nthe next. (Williams 1951: 466)\n\n\n\nI cannot survey all the motivations philosophers have had for the\nmoving spotlight theory. But the motivation that I like best appeals\nto the nature of our conscious experience. Of all the experiences I\nwill ever have, some of them are special. Those are the ones that I am\nhaving NOW. All those others are ghostly and insubstantial. But which\nexperiences have this special feature keeps changing. (Skow 2009:\n\u00a75)\n\n\n\nI find it impossible to relinquish the sensation of a flowing time and\na moving present moment. It is something so basic to my experience of\nthe world that I am repelled by the claim that it only an illusion or\nmisperception. (Davies 1995: 275)\n\n\n\nThere is hardly any experience that seems more persistently, or\nimmediately given to us than the relentless flow of time. (Schlesinger\n1991: 427)\n\n\nGiven that there is more than one conception of what temporal passage\nitself amounts to the relationship between this sort of passage and\ntemporal experience will not be straightforward. However, Le Poidevin\nhas suggested that there is a general argument which connects the two,\nhe calls it \u201cthe argument from experience\u201d (Le Poidevin\n2007: \u00a75.1) and it can be formulated along these lines:\n\nWe have experiences that are seemingly of the passage of\ntime.\nThe best explanations of this sort of experience all rely on the\npassage of time being an objective feature of reality\nTherefore temporal passage is a real and objective feature of\nreality.\n\n\nAs Le Poidevin points out, a variety of quite different experiential\nconsiderations have been construed as linked to the passage of\ntime\u2014e.g., the perception of change and motion, the (seeming)\nconfinement of the present\u2014so there is a cluster of different\nissues which need to be investigated. Useful critical appraisals of\nthese ongoing debates include Baron et al. (2015), Deng (2013, 2018),\nFrischhut (2015), Hoerl (2014), Prosser (2007, 2012, 2013, 2016).\n\nAmong B-theorists who want to deny that time really does pass one\npopular strategy is to focus on the second premise of argument from\nexperience and find alternative explanations for experiences that are\nsuggestive of passage. L.A. Paul has argued there are well-known\nresults from psychology and the cognitive sciences which are\npotentially of great use to B-theorists seeking such\nexplanations\u2014see Paul (2010) and also Le Poidevin (2007:\n\u00a75.5). In the case of apparent motion, for example, two\nstationary flashing spots on a computer screen will be seen to be\nmoving smoothly back and forth, provided the spots are sufficiently\nclose together and the rate of flashing is not too fast or too slow.\nIn a similar fashion, the moving images on a cinema screen are a\nproduct of the ways in which our brains process the sequences of\nstatic images being projected onto the screen. Paul suggests that\nthere is a more general lesson here: much of the dynamism we are\nnaturally inclined to suppose exists in the world in reality is being\nfabricated in our brains:\n\n\nOccam's razor suggests that the flow or animated character that we\noften refer to as \u201cmotion\u201d is just a mistake. Motion is\nsimply the change of location of a persisting object, and the flow or\nanimated character that we notice and identify with motion is merely\nan effect of the brain. (Paul 2010:\n 358)[20]\n\n\nSimon Prosser is a B-theorist who has on a number of\noccasions\u2014e.g., Prosser (2000, 2007, 2012, 2013,\n2016)\u2014urged adopting a quite radical response to the argument\nfrom experience. For Prosser the idea that temporal experience could\nlend support to any form of temporal passage doctrine is radically\nmisconceived: it is in fact quite impossible. A-theories of time are\nmetaphysically incoherent and temporal passage is impossible.\nA-theoretic properties cannot exist, and cannot even be represented in\nconsciousness.\n\nIn arguing against A-theories Prosser develops and deploys \u201cthe\nDetector Argument\u201d. Smoke detectors can reliably detect the\npresence of smoke, Geiger counters can detect radiation, could there\nbe a physical device capable of detecting temporal passage, one (say)\nthat is equipped with a bulb which lights up when passage is found?\nProsser argues that such a device is impossible: \u201cthere could be\nno physical system that would detect the passage of time\u201d\n(Prosser 2016: 34). The reason for this is simple and straightforward:\nalthough defenders of A-theories of time believe that time passes,\nthey don\u2019t usually hold that passage makes a detectable\nphysical difference to objects and events, and given this it is\nhard to see how any physical device could detect the existence of\ntemporal passage. Prosser points out that the positions on the nature\nof the relationship between mind and body that are currently taken\nseriously in contemporary philosophy all posit very close connections\nbetween minds and brains: either minds are brains, or the\nmental causally depends on brain processes down to their last detail.\nGiven the nature of this relationship \u201cif no physical system can\ndetect the passage of time then neither can the human mind\u201d\n(Prosser 2016: 35) and it is impossible for temporal passage to\nregister in human experience.\n\nProsser\u2019s claim that passage makes \u201cno physical difference\nto events\u201d is questionable on a number of counts. Some\nA-theorists equate temporal passage with the\ncoming-into-being of events\u2014presentists and growing\nblock theorists fall into this category. A-theorist of this kind will\nnot find Prosser\u2019s argument persuasive. They will point out that\nif time did not pass the physical universe as we know it simply would\nnot exist. Nothing would happen, there would be no physical\ninteractions between events, no event would cause another\nevent\u2014not if causation involves an earlier event bringing a\nlater event into existence. Indeed there wouldn\u2019t even any\nevents, since events are occurrences in time, and time for the\nA-theorist essentially involves passage. For more on this line of\nresponse see Phillips (2016), Skow (2018) and Dolev\n (2019).[21]\n\nEven if we set aside A-theories of this kind problems remains. Prosser\nnotes:\n\n\nArthur Eddington, who was aware, as long ago as 1928, that no physical\nsystem could detect the passage of time, drew the conclusion that\n\u201cconsciousness, looking out through a private door, can learn by\ndirect insight an underlying character of the world which physical\nmeasurements do not betray\u201d (Eddington 1928: 91) These days,\nhowever, I do not think we can regard views of this kind as\nacceptable. (Prosser 2016: 35)\n\n\nHowever, this issue is less straightforward than Prosser suggests. In\nThe Nature of the Physical World Eddington certainly did\nclaim that the material universe is dynamically temporal in a manner\nwhich physics does not recognize, and he also held that we know this\nbecause our consciousness provides us with some access to the real\nnature of the physical world. But in making these claims he\nwasn\u2019t relying on some sort of mystical revelation concerning\nthe true nature of things. Eddington defended a version of\npanpsychism, a fact which makes him something of a hero for\ncontemporary panpsychists\u2014see Strawson (2006) and Goff\n(2017).\n\nEddington, following in Russell\u2019s footsteps, held that physics\nonly reveals the causal and structural properties of physical things,\nit tells us nothing of their intrinsic nature\u2014about the inner\nnature of the stuff they are made from. If we assume, as seems\nplausible to many, that physical things must have some\nintrinsic nature, then if physics is silent in this regard there is an\nimportant consequence: the hypothesis that the physical processes in\nour brains associated with consciousness have an experiential\nintrinsic nature will be compatible with everything physics has to\nsay. In the light of this, Eddington suggests that it would be rather\nbizarre to adopt a different hypotheses and take the intrinsic nature\nof the relevant brain processes to be non-experiential:\n\n\nIt seems rather silly to prefer to attach it [consciousness] to\nsomething of a so-called \u201cconcrete\u201d nature inconsistent\nwith thought, and then to wonder where the thought comes from.\n(Eddington 1928: 259)\n\n\nSince there is nothing special about the material in our\nbrains\u2014they\u2019re composed of the same sort of basic physical\ningredients as mountains, oceans and trees\u2014then it seems\nplausible to conclude that if brain-stuff has an experiential\nintrinsic nature then all physical stuff\n will.[22]\n\nIt\u2019s true that Colin McGinn once characterized panpsychism in an\nutterly dismissive way:\n\n\na complete myth, a comforting piece of utter balderdash \u2026\nisn\u2019t there something vaguely hippyish, i.e. stoned, about the\ndoctrine? (2006: 93)\n\n\nIt\u2019s also true that panpsychism has its share of\nproblems\u2014in common to all the other attempted solutions to\nproblem of how consciousness and the physical world are related. But\nit\u2019s also the case that in contemporary philosophy of mind\ncircles panpsychism has a respectability it hasn\u2019t had for some\ntime\u2014see Br\u00fcntrup & Jaskolla (2016) and Seager\n(2019).\n\nReturning to the detector argument, if Eddington\u2019s response has\nto be treated with respect, then Prosser\u2019s conclusion that no\nphysical system can possibly detect any form of temporal passage looks\nto be premature. If our experiences are revealing the inner intrinsic\nnatures of certain neural processes\u2014as panpsychists\nmaintain\u2014then if these experiences possess dynamic flow-type\nproperties, then these properties will belong to the physical world.\nNeural processes, are after all, physical processes. In which case\nthere is at least one way in which a physical system can detect one\nform of temporal passage.\n\nThis point also has a more general metaphysical significance. If\npanpsychism is true then everything in the universe is enjoying some\nform of consciousness. If (as many suppose) consciousness is\nessentially temporal, then if panpsychism is true everything in the\nuniverse will be enjoying a temporal form of consciousness. In which\ncase the competing accounts of the structure of temporal experience\nare competing accounts of the nature of reality as a whole\u2014in\nmuch the way Bergson suggested, a century or so ago.\n",
