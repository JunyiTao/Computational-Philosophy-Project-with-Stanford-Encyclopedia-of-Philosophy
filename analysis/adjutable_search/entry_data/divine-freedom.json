    "preamble": "\n\n\nThe topic of divine freedom concerns the extent to which a divine\nbeing \u2014 in particular, the supreme divine being, God \u2014 can\nbe free.  Two preliminary questions play a central role in framing the\ndiscussion of divine freedom. I: Apart from freedom, what properties\nare held to be essential to God? II: What conception(s) of freedom\ngovern the inquiry? Discussions of divine freedom typically concern\nthe traditional conception of God as a being who is essentially\nomnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and eternal. With respect to\nthe second question, there are two conceptions of freedom common in\nphilosophical discussion: the compatibilist conception and the\nlibertarian conception. The topic of divine freedom concerns the\nquestion of whether God, as traditionally conceived, can enjoy\nwhatever sort and degree of freedom required for moral responsibility,\nthankfulness, and praise. But when it is asked, \u201cCan God be\nFree?\u201d it is important to specify what it is about which God\nmight be thought to act freely. Since God is essentially omnipotent,\nomniscient, perfectly good, and eternal, it is clear that God is not\nfree to weaken himself, to become ignorant, to do something evil, or\nto destroy himself. But it does seem important that God be free with\nrespect to bringing about any one of a number of possible worlds, as\nwell as free to bring about no world at all. What if, however, among\npossible worlds there is one that is the best? Is God then free to\ncreate any world other than the best?  This question has been a center\nof controversy for centuries. In considering this question and others\nit will be helpful to consider the views of some important\nphilosophers who have contributed significantly to the literature on\nthe topic of divine freedom. The philosophers whose views will be\nconsidered most fully are Leibniz and Samuel Clarke. These two are\nparticularly important because, in addition to being very able\nphilosophers, they engaged each other in the controversy between the\ncompatibilist's and the libertarian view of freedom. In the justly\nfamous Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, Leibniz championed\ncompatibilism, while Clarke represented the libertarian cause. In\naddition to Leibniz and Clarke, some important 20th century\ncontributions on this topic by Thomas Morris and Robert Adams will\nalso be discussed.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence and the Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\n\nIn 1715 a series of written exchanges began between Gottfried Leibniz\nand Samuel Clarke. Halted by Leibniz's death in 1716, the series was\nedited and published by Clarke in 1717. (See Leibniz-Clarke\nCorrespondence, 1956 [1717]). [References to the Leibniz-Clarke\nCorrespondence will be incorporated in the text as L-C, followed by\nthe appropriate page number in Alexander's edition.]\n\n\nClarke and Leibniz agreed that human reason can demonstrate that there\nnecessarily exists an essentially omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly\ngood being who has freely created the world. But their accounts of\ndivine freedom were profoundly different. It is helpful, therefore, to\nhighlight their differences over divine freedom and to consider\nwhether either conception of divine freedom can be reconciled with the\nabsolute perfection of the creator. Thecentral issue is whether either\nconception of divine freedom can be fully reconciled with the\nrequirement imposed by God's perfect goodness, (in Clarke's words)\n\u201cthe necessity of always doing what is best.\u201d\n\n\nAn important issue in the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence concerns the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason (PSR), particularly its implications\nfor how we must understand divine and human freedom. In his second\nletter Leibniz advances the principle and pronounces on its\nimplications for theology and metaphysics. \u201cNow, by that single\nprinciple, viz.  that there ought to be a sufficient reason why things\nshould be so, and not otherwise, one may demonstrate the being of a\nGod, and all the other parts of metaphysics or natural theology\u201d\n(L-C, 16).  Leibniz elsewhere expresses PSR more fully as the\nprinciple \u201c\u2026that no fact can be real or existent, no\nstatement true, unless there be a sufficient reason why it is so and\nnot otherwise,\u2026\u201d (1714, paragraph 32). He illustrates PSR\nby citing the example of Archimedes who observed that if there be a\nperfect balance, and if equal weights are hung on the two ends of that\nbalance, the balance will not move. Why? Leibniz answers: \u201cIt is\nbecause no reason can be given, why one side should weigh down, rather\nthan another\u201d (L-C, 16). It was perhaps unfortunate for Leibniz\nto use this example. For it enabled Clarke to charge him with treating\nan agent no differently from a balance: just as the balance cannot\nmove without a greater weight on one side, and must move downward on\nthe side with the greater weight, so the agent cannot choose without\nsome motive to choose, and must choose in accordance with the\nstrongest motive. But, Clarke argues, this is to deny the agent any\npower to act in the absence of a motive, and to deny the agent any\npower to act in opposition to the strongest motive. It is, in Clarke's\nview, to deny that there are any genuine agents at all. For it is the\nnature of an agent to have the power to act or not act. A balance has\nno such power; it is simply acted upon by whatever weights are placed\nupon it. As Clarke concludes in his fifth and final reply:\nThere is no similitude between a balance being moved by\nweights or impulse, and a mind moving itself, or acting upon the view\nof certain motives. The difference is, that the one is entirely\npassive; which is being subject to absolute necessity: the other not\nonly is acted upon, but acts also; which is the essence of liberty\n(L-C, 97).\n\n\nClarke's rejection of any \u201csimilitude\u201d between the\nmovements of a balance and the acts of an agent is closely connected\nto his disagreement with Leibniz over PSR. In his response to the\nsecond letter Clarke appears to accept PSR. Thus he says: \u201cIt is\nvery true, that nothing is, without a sufficient reason why it is, and\nwhy it is thus rather than otherwise\u201d (L-C, 20). Clearly, if\nwhen writing \u201cnothing is\u201d Clarke means to include any fact\nor truth whatever, then he cannot consistently go on, as he does, to\nexempt certain facts or truths from the necessity of having a\nsufficient reason. Leibniz may have read Clarke's \u201cnothing\nis\u201d as encompassing any fact or truth whatever, which would\napproach Leibniz's own understanding of PSR. If so, this would explain\nwhy in his third letter Leibniz complains that although Clarke grants\nhim this important principle, \u201che grants it only in words, and\nin reality denies it. Which shows that he does not fully perceive the\nstrength of it\u201d (L-C, 25). However, despite his statement\n\u201cnothing is without a sufficient reason why it is,\u201d it is\nclear that Clarke cannot have intended to agree with Leibniz that\nevery fact or truth has a sufficient reason. Nor could he have agreed\nthat every contingent fact or truth has a sufficient reason. For he\nimmediately goes on to say that \u201cthis sufficient reason is\noft-times no other, than the mere will of God,\u201d citing as an\nexample God's volition to create this system of matter in one\nparticular place within absolute space, rather than in some other\nplace in absolute space. There is simply nothing to recommend one\nparticular place in absolute space over another. Hence, in this case\nthere can be no other reason than the mere will of God. (Presumably,\nClarke would say that God had a sufficient reason to create this\nsystem of matter in some place or other in absolute space, but He did\nnot have a sufficient reason to create it in this particular place.)\nIn his third letter Leibniz cites this case as just the sort of thing\nthat PSR rules out as impossible. On his understanding of PSR there\ncan be no situations at all in which a choice has been made without a\nsufficient reason for making that particular choice. To think\notherwise is to suppose an exception to PSR. (Leibniz does allow that\nthere are many human acts that appear to lack a sufficient\nreason. There are acts for which we cannot find a sufficient\nmotive. For example, no motive is apparent for why an agent stepped\nover the threshold with his left foot rather than his right. But he\nsupposed in all such cases there is some unconscious perception or\npassion that provides the sufficient reason.) It is clear that Clarke\nallows for such exceptions.\n\n\nA deeper and more important disagreement concerning PSR is also\nreflected in Clarke's reaction to Leibniz's analogy between the\nsufficient reason for the balance to move and the sufficient reason\nfor an agent to do one thing rather than another. For Clarke agrees\nwith Leibniz that often enough the agent has a sufficient reason for\nher action. So, he allows that PSR is satisfied for a vast array of\nhuman and divine acts. What he denies is that the sufficient reason\nfor the agent doing one thing rather than another operates on the\nagent in the way in which the heavier weight operates on the\nbalance. Clearly, the heavier weight on one side of the balance is a\ndetermining cause of the movement of the balance. Given the\ncircumstances and the placement of that weight on the one side of the\nbalance, nothing else could happen than what did happen, it was\nnecessary that the balance move as it did.  But to suppose that the\nreason or motive that is the sufficient reason for the agent to do one\nthing rather than another is a determining cause of the agent's act is\nto deny any power on the agent's part to perform or not perform that\nparticular act. It is to render the agent's act necessary and to deny\nthe agent's freedom of will. Thus, for Clarke, a reason or motive may\nbe the sufficient reason for the agent's action. But, unlike the\nweight in the balance that is the determining cause of the movement of\nthe balance, the reason or motive is not the determining cause of the\nagent's act. As he puts it elsewhere:\nOccasions indeed they (reasons and motives) may be, and\nare, upon which that substance in man, wherein the self-moving\nprinciple resides, freely exerts its active power. But it is the\nself-moving principle, and not at all the reason or motive, which is\nthe physical or efficient cause of action. When we say, in vulgar\nspeech, that motives or reason determine a man; it is not but a figure\nor metaphor. It is the man that freely determines himself to act\n(1978.  IV. 723).\n\n\nWhat we've seen is that Clarke's conception of what it is to be a free\nagent requires first that the agent may act in some particular way\neven in the absence of his having a sufficient reason to act in that\nparticular way. Thus, there are exceptions to PSR. Second, we've seen\nthat when the agent has a sufficient reason to do a particular act and\nfreely does that act, the sufficient reason or motive is not a\ndetermining cause of the agent's act. At the time of the act the agent\nhad the power not to perform that act. So, on Clarke's libertarian\nview there is a profound difference between the sufficient reason for\nthe balance moving in a particular way and the sufficient reason for\nan agent's free act. In the first case the sufficient reason is a\ndetermining cause, in the second it is not. Leibniz, however, sees no\nneed to suppose there are exceptions to PSR and no need to treat the\nmotive for the agent's free act as anything other than a determining\ncause of that act.\n2. Leibniz's problem with Divine Freedom: the necessity of God's choosing what is Best.\n\n\nWith this background in place, we can now look at the problem of\ndivine perfection and freedom and then consider the very different\nsolutions proposed by Clarke and Leibniz to that problem. Following\nLeibniz, we can imagine God considering a variety of worlds he might\ncreate. One might be a world in which there are no conscious creatures\nat all, a world composed solely of dead matter. (Of course, given that\nthe actual world includes everything that exists, including God, the\nworld in question is here being considered apart from God.) Another\nmight be a world composed (at some stage in its history) of living,\nconscious creatures whose lives are meaningful, morally good, and\nhappy. If we imagine God making a choice between these two worlds, it\nseems evident that he would create the latter. Surely, a world with\nconscious creatures living morally good, satisfying lives is, other\nthings being equal, a very good world, and better than a world\nconsisting of nothing but dull bits of matter swirling endlessly in a\nvoid. And isn't it absolutely certain that an omnipotent, omniscient,\nperfectly good being would create the better world if he could? But if\nwe pursue this line of thought, problems begin to emerge. Assume, as\nseems evident, that the second world is the better world. If God were\nlimited to these two worlds, he would face three choices: creating the\ninferior world, creating the superior world, creating no world at all.\nFor God to decide to create no world over creating a world that is,\nall things considered, a very good world, would be for God to do less\nthan the best that he can do. If so, it seems that God's perfect\ngoodness would require him to create the very good world. But if God's\nperfect goodness requires him to create the very good world, rather\nthan creating the inferior world or not creating a world at all, what\nare we to make of that part of the idea of God that declares that he\ncreated the world freely? To say that God freely created the good\nworld seems to imply that he was free not to do so, that he could have\ncreated the inferior world, or refrained from creating either\nworld. But if his perfect goodness requires him to create the good\nworld, how is it possible that he was free to create the inferior\nworld or not to create any world? This is a simple way of picturing\nthe problem of divine perfection and divine freedom.\n\n\nInitially, one may be tempted to solve this problem by viewing God's\nperfect goodness (which includes his absolute moral perfection) as\nanalogous to our goodness. A morally good person may actually do the\nvery best action available to her while being free not to do it, or\nfree to do something bad instead. Of course, had she freely done the\nbad thing, she would have exhibited some sort of moral failing. But\nthe mere fact that she was free to have done the bad thing doesn't\nimpugn whatever degree of moral goodness she possesses. So why should\nGod's perfect goodness preclude his being free to create a less good\nworld, or even a bad world? Had he done that, he would have ceased\nbeing the morally perfect being he is, just as the morally good person\nwould have diminished somewhat her moral goodness had she freely done\nthe wrong thing.\n\n\nThis solution fails because, although a human person can become less\ngood or even bad, God cannot become less than absolutely perfect.\nAlthough we may achieve a certain degree of moral virtue in our lives,\nwe can lose it and sink back into being the morally mediocre persons\nwe perhaps once were. This is because it is not part of our very\nnature to be at a certain level of goodness. According to the\nhistorically dominant view in Western religions, however, God, by his\nvery nature, is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good. He cannot\nbecome weak, ignorant, or ignoble. Just as the number two is\nnecessarily even, God is necessarily supreme in power, goodness, and\nknowledge. He is not some infant deity who by earnest striving slowly\nacquired these perfections and, like us, can diminish his goodness by\nintentionally acting badly. He necessarily has these perfections from\nall eternity, and he cannot divest himself of them anymore than the\nnumber two can cease to be even. God's perfections are constituents of\nhis nature, not acquired characteristics. So, while we may be free to\nlose our degree of goodness by using our freedom to pursue the bad,\nGod is not free to lose his perfections by using his freedom to pursue\nthe bad. Indeed, he is not free to pursue the bad. For if he were free\nto pursue the bad, then he could become less perfect than he is. And\nthat is simply impossible.\n\n\nThe problem of divine perfection and freedom was particularly acute\nfor Leibniz. Since God necessarily exists and is necessarily\nomnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good, it seems he would\nnecessarily be drawn to create the best. If this be so, then when God\nsurveyed all the possible worlds, he must have chosen the best, with\nthe result that the actual world is the best of all possible worlds.\nLeibniz embraced the conclusion of this reasoning: the actual world is\nthe best of all possible worlds. But how then could God be free in\nchoosing to create the best? As a first step in the direction of\nanswering this question, it should be noted that two different views\nof divine freedom have emerged in western thought. According to the\nfirst view, God is free in creating a world or in acting within the\nworld he has created provided nothing outside of him determines him to\ncreate the world he creates or determines him to act in a particular\nway in the world he has created. According to the second view, God is\nfree in creating or acting within his creation provided it was in his\npower not to create what he did or not to act within his creation as\nhe did.\n\n\nThe first of these two views has the advantage of establishing beyond\nquestion that God possesses freedom from external forces with respect\nto his selection of a world to create. For given that he is omnipotent\nand the creator of all things other than himself, it is evident that\nnothing outside of him determines him to create whatever he does\ncreate. And given that whatever he creates is within his control, it\nwould seem that he is completely at liberty to act as he sees fit\nwithin the world he has created. So, the fact that nothing outside of\nGod determines him to create or act as he does clearly shows that God\nis an autonomous agent; he is self-determining in the sense that his\nactions are the result of decisions that are determined only by his\nown nature. But is this sufficient to establish that God is genuinely\nfree? It is generally believed that a human being may not be free in\nperforming a certain action even when it is clear that the person was\nnot determined to perform that action by external forces.  Perhaps the\nperson was in the grip of some internal passion or irresistible\nimpulse that necessitated the performance of that action, overcoming\nthe person's judgment that the action was wrong or unwise.  With\nrespect to human beings, the defender of the first view of divine\nfreedom can agree that the mere absence of determining external agents\nor forces is not sufficient for an individual's action to be free. But\nin the case of God, as opposed to humans, the defender can argue that\nit is sufficient. For in God there is no possibility of his passions\novercoming the judgment of reason. As Leibniz remarks:\nthe Stoics said that only the wise man is free; and one's\nmind is indeed not free when it is possessed by a great passion, for\nthen one cannot will as one should, i.e. with proper deliberation. It\nis in that way that God alone is perfectly free, and the created minds\nare free only in proportion as they are above passion. (1982,\n175).\n\n\nThe chief objection to this view of divine freedom is that it doesn't\nsufficiently recognize the importance of agents having control over\ntheir free acts. An action was performed freely only if the agent was\nfree to perform the action and free not to perform it. It must have\nbeen up to the agent whether to perform or not perform that act. If\nsome external force or internal passion was beyond the control of the\nagent, and the agent's action was inevitable given that external force\nor internal passion, then the agent did not act freely in performing\nthat action. Since God is a purely rational being and not subject to\nuncontrollable passions that sometimes compel human agents to act, it\nis tempting to conclude that God enjoys perfect freedom of action. But\nthis will be so only if there are no other features in God that both\nnecessitate his actions and are not within his control. Because human\nagents are generally thought to have the power to act against the\ncounsel of reason, we credit their acts due to reason \u2014 as\nopposed to those acts due to irresistible impulses \u2014 as acts\nthey perform freely.  For we believe they were free to reject the\ncounsel of reason and act otherwise. But what if God cannot reject the\ncounsel of his reason as to what action to perform? A human agent who\nis morally good and rational may yet have \u2014 or previously had\n\u2014 the power to refrain from acting as his goodness and reason\ndirect. But can this be true of God?  And, if it cannot be, how can we\nthen say that God acts freely?\n\n\nLeibniz was well aware of the problem posed by the fact that God's\nchoice of the best is necessary, given that he is necessarily\nomnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good. In fact, his most\nwell-known solution to the problem of divine perfection and freedom\nrecognizes that if God's choice of the best is absolutely necessary\nthen God is not free with respect to creation. In his Theodicy and in\nhis correspondence with Clarke, he is careful to distinguish absolute\nnecessity, hypothetical necessity, and moral necessity, arguing that\nit is morally necessary but not absolutely necessary that God chose to\ncreate the best world. To determine whether Leibniz can solve the\nproblem of divine perfection and freedom it is important to examine\nhis distinction between moral and absolute necessity and to determine\nwhether he succeeds in escaping the charge that on his view of things\nit is absolutely necessary that God chooses to create the best.\n\n\nIn discussing this matter it will be helpful to consider the\nfollowing argument:\n If God exists and is omnipotent, perfectly wise and good,\nthen he chooses to create the best of all possible worlds. [That\nLeibniz is committed to (1) follows from (a) his view that God is\ndetermined by the best, and (b) his view that among possible worlds\nthere is a unique best world.]\nGod exists and is omnipotent, perfectly wise, and perfectly good.\n[Leibniz endorses the Ontological Argument which purports to be a\nproof of (2).]\n\n\n\ntherefore,\n\nGod chooses to create the best of all possible worlds.\n\n\n\nLeibniz must deny that (3) is absolutely necessary. For whatever is\nabsolutely necessary cannot logically be otherwise. Hence, if (3) is\nabsolutely necessary, it would be logically impossible for God to\nchoose to create any world other than the best. It would not be a\ncontingent matter that God chooses to create the best. Nor, of course,\ncould God be free in choosing to create the best.\n\n\nLeibniz contends that God's choosing to create the best is morally\nnecessary, not absolutely necessary.\nGod is bound by a moral necessity, to make things in such a\nmanner that there can be nothing better: otherwise \u2026 he would\nnot himself be satisfied with his work, he would blame himself for its\nimperfection; and that conflicts with the supreme felicity of the\ndivine nature. (1710, 201)\n\n\nWhat is it for it to be morally necessary for God to choose to create\nthe best of all possible worlds? It seems clear that its meaning is\nsuch that if God were to choose to create less than the best it would\nlogically follow that he is lacking in wisdom, goodness or power.\nIndeed, Leibniz says that \u201cto do less good than one could is to\nbe lacking in wisdom or in goodness\u201d, that the most perfect\nunderstanding \u201ccannot fail to act in the most perfect way, and\nconsequently to choose the best\u201d (1710, 201). Consider again\nproposition (1) in the above argument. What Leibniz says about moral\nnecessity implies that (1) is itself absolutely necessary. For he\nclearly holds that from the fact that a being does less good than it\ncould it logically follows that the being in question is lacking in\nwisdom or goodness. And one cannot hold this without being committed\nto holding that the consequent of (1) logically follows from the\nantecedent of (1). [Actually, the consequent of (1) logically follows\nfrom the antecedent of (1) only if it is absolutely necessary that\nthere is a best possible world. Leibniz does think it is absolutely\nnecessary that there is a unique best among possible worlds.] That is,\nLeibniz is committed to holding that (1) is a hypothetical necessity.\nAn if \u2014 then proposition is a hypothetical necessity provided\nthe consequent logically follows from the antecedent. Of course, the\nmere fact that a particular consequent logically follows from a\ncertain antecedent \u2014 as, for example, \u2018John is\nunmarried\u2019 logically follows from \u2018John is a\nbachelor\u2019 \u2014 is insufficient to render the consequent\nabsolutely necessary. It is not logically impossible for \u2018John\nis unmarried\u2019 to be false.  So, although his asserting the moral\nnecessity of God's choosing to create the best commits Leibniz to the\nabsolute necessity of the hypothetical proposition (1), in itself this\ncommitment still leaves him free to deny that God's choosing to create\nthe best is absolutely necessary. Two further points show that he\ncannot escape the conclusion that God's choosing to create the best is\nabsolutely necessary. First, proposition (2) [God exists and is\nomnipotent, perfectly wise, and perfectly good.], the antecedent of\n(1), is itself absolutely necessary. We've already noted that both\nClarke and Leibniz are committed to the view that (2) is not a\ncontingent truth; it is absolutely necessary. Second, it is a rule of\nlogic that if a hypothetical proposition is itself absolutely\nnecessary, and its antecedent is also absolutely necessary, then its\nconsequent must be absolutely necessary as well. Thus, if both (1) and\n(2) are absolutely necessary, (3) must be absolutely necessary as\nwell. Since Leibniz is committed to the view that both (1) and (2) are\nabsolutely necessary, it appears that his view commits him to the view\nthat (3) is absolutely necessary. [The early Leibniz toyed with\ndenying the logical rule that what logically follows from what is\nabsolutely necessary is itself absolutely necessary. See Adams, 1994,\nCh.1.]\n\n\nBefore turning to Clarke's attempt to solve the problem of divine\nperfection and freedom, we should note that Leibniz often insists that\nthe act of will must be free in the sense of not being necessitated by\nthe motives that give rise to it. His often repeated remark on this\nmatter is that motives \u201cincline without necessitating\u201d\n(L-C, 57). This view appears to conflict with the view I have ascribed\nto him: that the strongest motive in the agent determines the agent to\nchoose as he does. It suggests instead that the agent had the power to\nwill otherwise even though the motive and circumstances be unchanged.\nFor, as he says, the motives don't necessitate but only incline the\nagent to will as he does. But this seems not to be what he means by\nhis phrase \u201cmotives incline without necessitating\u201d. On his\nview, motives and circumstances necessitate the act of will in the\nsense that it is logically or causally impossible that those motives\nand circumstances should obtain and the act of will not occur.\nLeibniz's claim that they don't necessitate the act of will means only\nthat the act of will itself is not thereby rendered something that is\nabsolutely necessary. [For a more extended account of this\ninterpretation of Leibniz's dictum, \u201cmotives incline but do not\nnecessitate,\u201d see Parkinson, 1970, 50-53.] That is, he is simply\nnoting that even though there be a necessary connection between the\nmotive and the act of will, this does not mean that the act of will\ncannot itself be contingent. As we saw above, God's being omnipotent,\nomniscient, and perfectly good necessitates God's choice of the best.\nHowever, the fact that there is a necessary connection between his\nbeing perfect and his choice of the best does not imply that his\nchoice of the best is itself absolutely necessary. Leibniz registers\nthis point (in a somewhat misleading fashion) by saying that God's\nmotives \u201cincline without necessitating\u201d his choice of the\nbest. We should not be misled by this phrase into thinking that he\nholds that the connection between his being perfect and his choice of\nthe best is anything less than absolutely necessary. And when we then\nnote that God's being perfect is absolutely necessary, the logical\nrule dictates the conclusion that his choice of the best is itself\nabsolutely necessary. This being so, we can conclude that God's choice\nto create the best is not free; it is absolutely necessary.\n3. Clarke's Problem with Divine Freedom: the power to choose otherwise is required for freedom.\n\n\nIn contrast to Locke, who characterized freedom as the power to carry\nout the action that we choose (will) to do, leaving the choice\n(volition) itself to be causally necessitated by the agent's motives,\nClarke locates freedom squarely at the level of the choice to act or\nnot act. \u201c\u2026 the essence of liberty consists in [a\nperson's] having a continual power of choosing whether he shall act or\nwhether he shall forbear acting\u201d (1738, 101). The implication of\nClarke's view is that freedom (liberty) would be impossible should a\nperson's choices be causally necessitated by his motives or desires.\nFor if a person's choice to act is causally necessitated by earlier\nstates of his body or mind, then at the time of that choice it was not\nin the agent's power to choose to not act. It is for Clarke a\nsecondary matter whether the agent is able to carry out his\nchoice. Indeed, Clarke goes so far as to declare that a prisoner in\nchains is free to will to leave or will to stay. That he cannot\nsuccessfully execute his choice doesn't rob him of the power to choose\n(Presumable, he would allow that one who knows he is in chains may\nwell see the pointlessness of choosing to leave and, therefore, not\nexercise his power so to choose.) Of course, since God is omnipotent,\nhis power to carry out the action he chooses to do is unlimited. But\nour question is whether God has it in his power to choose to refrain\nfrom following what he knows to be the best course of action. Should\nhe lack that power, it follows from Clarke's conception of freedom\nthat God does not freely choose the best course of action. In fact, it\nwould follow for Clarke that in this instance God is totally passive\nand not an agent at all. It would also follow for Clarke that it would\nmake no sense to praise or thank God for choosing the best course of\naction. We must now see how Clarke endeavors to avoid the absolute\nnecessity of God's choosing in accordance with his knowledge of what\nis the best course of action.\n\n\nClarke's overall view is clear enough. He distinguishes between the\nintellect (understanding) and the will. It is the function of the\nunderstanding to determine what course of action to pursue. It is the\nfunction of the will (the power we have to will this or that) to\ninitiate the action specified by the understanding. It is one thing,\nhowever, to arrive through deliberation at the judgment that doing a\ncertain thing is best, and quite another thing to choose (will) to do\nthat thing. Since such a judgment terminates the process of\ndeliberation about what to do, Clarke and others referred to it as\n\u201cthe last judgment of the understanding.\u201d It is the\njudgment that terminates deliberation and is followed by the act of\nwill to perform (or not perform) the action specified in the judgment.\nOften enough, our motives and desires are sufficiently clear and\nstrong to causally necessitate the judgment as to what to do. No other\njudgment is possible in the circumstances. In short, there may be no\nfreedom at all with respect to the judgment as to what action to\nperform. On Clarke's view, freedom enters only when the will chooses\nto act or not act in accordance with the judgment of the\nunderstanding.  Thus, when there is a best course of action for God to\nperform, his judgment that it is the best course to pursue is, Clarke\ntells us, absolutely necessary. But God's choice to act in accordance\nwith what his understanding approves is completely free; he always has\nthe power to choose otherwise.\nGod always discerns and approves what is just and good,\nnecessarily, and cannot do otherwise: But he always acts or does what\nis just and good freely; that is, having at the same time a full\nnatural or physical power of acting differently. (1978. IV,\n717)\n\n\nIt is instructive to contrast Clarke's view of freedom with a stream\nof thought in Christian theology, dating back at least to Augustine,\naccording to which the saints in heaven are perfected to the degree\nthat they not only do not sin, they no longer are able to sin, a\nperfection that is found in God and the angels. In our earthly state\nwe have the freedom to turn from the good and do evil, but in the life\nto come we shall have a superior sort of freedom, a freedom that does\nnot include the ability to do evil. Thus Augustine says:\nFor the first freedom of will which man received when he\nwas created upright consisted in an ability not to sin, but also in an\nability to sin; whereas this last freedom of will shall be superior,\ninasmuch as it shall not be able to sin. This, indeed, shall not be a\nnatural ability, but the gift of God. For it is one thing to be God,\nanother thing to be a partaker of God. God by nature cannot sin, but\nthe partaker of God receives this inability from God. (1948, Bk. 12,\nCh. 30)\n\n\nIn his book, A Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Human\nLiberty, Anthony Collins had appealed to this stream of thought\nin support of his view that freedom does not require any power to\nchoose or do otherwise. Clarke wrote a rather devastating response to\nCollins's book. In the course of his response to Collins we find the\nfollowing remark:\nNeither saints, nor angels, nor God himself, have in any\ndegree the less liberty upon account of the perfection of their\nnature: Because between the physical power of action and the\nperfection of judgment which is not action (which two things this\nauthor constantly confounds) there is no connection. God judges what\nis right, and approves what is good, by a physical necessity of\nnature; in which physical necessity, all notion of action is\nnecessarily excluded. But doing what is good is wholly owing to an\nactive principle, in which is essentially included the notion of\nliberty. (1978. IV, 731)\n\n\nClearly, Clarke rejects this stream of thought in Christian\ntheology. He allows that the saints in heaven no longer have any\ndesire to sin and take no delight in it. Indeed, it may be absolutely\ncertain that with purified desires and a perfected judgment they will\nalways freely do what is right. (See 1738, 124) And this will be an\nenormous difference from life on earth where we are often tempted to\nsin by bad desires and faulty judgment. But what cannot be is that the\nsaints or the angels, or God for that matter, cease to have the\nability or power to choose to do other than what is right. For then\nthey would not be free in choosing and doing what is right. To lose\nthe power to choose otherwise is to lose the power to choose\nfreely. And if one loses that power one ceases to be an agent at\nall.\n\n\nWe can begin to get at the difficulty in Clarke's view of divine\nfreedom by considering God's perfections and their implications for\nwhether he can freely choose to do evil. Clarke readily sees that were\na perfectly good, omniscient being to freely choose to do some evil\ndeed, it would thereby cease to be perfectly good. And it would cease\nto be perfectly good even if, as could not happen in God's case, it\nwere prevented from carrying out the evil deed it chose to do. For the\nfree choice to do evil is itself inconsistent with continuing to be a\nperfectly good, omniscient being. A being who freely chooses to do\nwhat it knows to be an evil deed thereby ceases to be a perfectly good\nbeing. So, if God were to freely choose to do an evil deed, he would\ncease to be perfectly good. In short, it is not logically possible for\nGod both to freely choose to do evil and to continue to be perfectly\ngood. Now, since Clarke holds with Leibniz that God necessarily exists\nand necessarily is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good, we can\nadvance to the simpler conclusion that it is not logically possible\nfor God to freely chose to do evil. It is not logically possible\nbecause it is inconsistent with what is logically necessary: the\nexistence of a being (God) who is necessarily omnipotent, omniscient,\nand perfectly good.\n\n\nAn essential attribute of a being is an attribute that the being\nnecessarily possesses. Clarke holds that the moral perfections of the\ndeity are essential aspects of the divine nature. \u201c\u2026\njustice, goodness, and all the other moral attributes of God are as\nessential to the divine nature as the natural attributes of eternity,\ninfinity, and the like\u201d (1738, 120).\n\n\nConsider now the question: Does God ever freely choose not to do evil?\nI think we can see that Clarke's own views commit him to a negative\nanswer to this question. For God chooses freely not to do something\nonly if it is in his power to choose to do that thing \u2014 choosing\nfreely, Clarke insists, logically requires the power to choose\notherwise. But it cannot be in anyone's power to make a certain choice\nif it is logically impossible that the person make that choice. (If\nthere is no possible world in which a person makes a certain choice,\nit cannot be that the person, nevertheless, has it within his power to\nmake that choice.) Therefore, since it is logically impossible for God\nto choose to do evil, it is not in God's power to choose to do evil.\nAnd since it is not in God's power to choose to do evil, it cannot be\nthat God's choice not to do evil is a free choice. If God chooses not\nto do evil, he so chooses of necessity, not freely. And this being so,\nit makes no sense for us to thank God, or to be grateful to him, for\nchoosing not to do evil. He could not have chosen otherwise.\n\n\nSince the claim that God does not freely choose not to do evil is\nrather central to the examination of Clarke's views on divine\nperfection and freedom, it is useful to consider another argument in\nsupport of it.\n If p logically implies q, and q is\nfalse, it is in an agent's power to bring it about that p\nonly if it is in that agent's power to bring about that\nq. [For a defense of this principle see Hasker, 96-115.]\nThat God chooses to do evil logically implies that God is not\nperfectly good.\nIt is false that God is not perfectly good. \n\n\n\ntherefore,\n\nIf it is in God's power to bring it about that he chooses to do\nevil then it is in his power to bring it about that he is not perfectly\ngood. (from 1, 2, and 3)\nIt is not in God's power to bring it about that he is not perfectly\ngood. \n\n\n\ntherefore,\n\nIt is not in God's power to choose to do evil. \n\n\n\ntherefore,\n\nIf God chooses not to do evil, God chooses not to do evil of\nnecessity, not freely.\n\n\n\nBefore examining two attempts by Clarke to avoid any limitations on\nthe scope of divine liberty, consider whether it is in God's power to\nchoose contrary to what he judges to be best. Clearly, God cannot\nchoose to do evil. But to choose contrary to what is judged to be best\nis evil or morally wrong only if choosing to do what is judged to be\nbest is morally obligatory. To claim that it is morally obligatory\nignores the real possibility that choosing what is best is\nsupererogatory, beyond the call of duty. There are choices which are\ngood to make but not required as our duty. It would be a mistake,\ntherefore, to infer God's inability to choose to act contrary to what\nhe judges to be best from his inability to choose to do evil.\nNevertheless, it does seem to be logically impossible for perfect\ngoodness to choose to act contrary to what is best. And this seems to\nbe Clarke's own view of the matter. Thus he declares \u201cthat\nthough God is a most perfectly free agent, yet he cannot but do always\nwhat is best and wisest in the whole\u201d (1738, 120-121). To choose\notherwise, he thinks, is to act contrary to perfect wisdom and\ngoodness.\n\n\nHow does Clarke endeavor to avoid the conclusion that God's perfect\ngoodness precludes his being free in many of his choices? His general\napproach to this difficulty is to distinguish two sorts of\nnecessities: moral and physical. If one state or event physically\nnecessitates another state or event, then the second state or event\ncannot occur freely. Thus he would say that hanging a greater weight\non the left end of an accurate balance physically necessitates the\ndownward movement on the left side of the balance. Here, even if the\nbalance were endowed with consciousness, there would be no possibility\nof the balance freely moving downward on the left. For the balance has\nno power to do other than move downwards on the left side. To\nillustrate the other sort of necessity, he offers the example of God's\npromising that on a given day he will not destroy the world. The\npromise morally necessitates God's refraining from destroying the\nworldon that particular day. But, says Clarke, it would be absurd to\nthink that God therefore lacked the physical power on that day to\ndestroy the world.\nGod's performing his promise is always consequent upon his\nmaking it: Yet there is no connection between them, as between cause\nand effect: For, not the promise of God, but his active power, is the\nalone physical or efficient cause of the performance (1978. IV,\n9).\n\n\nGod's refraining from destroying the world on that day is both\nmorally necessary and free. For he both retains the physical power to\ndestroy the world on that day and also cannot (morally speaking) break\nhis promise.\n\n\nThe trouble with this solution is that it doesn't focus on the\nparticular act of choosing to break his promise. If we accept, as it\nseems we must in God's case, that it is logically impossible for God\nto choose to break his solemn promise, then it follows that it is not\nin God's power to break his solemn promise. Indeed, for God to choose\nto break his solemn promise is for God to divest himself of his\nabsolute perfection. And, clearly, it is not logically possible for\nGod to cease to be absolutely perfect.\n\n\nIn a revealing passage Clarke appears to recognize that there are some\nchoices that do not lie within God's power because they logically\nimply the destruction of his essential perfections. He begins the\npassage by noting that there are necessary relations among things,\nrelations that God eternally knows. By this he means that some states\nof things are necessarily better than other states of things. (For\nexample, there being innocent beings who do not suffer eternally is\nnecessarily better than there being innocent beings who do suffer\neternally.) By knowing these necessary relations, God knows the\nchoices required by his perfect wisdom and goodness. Noting that God\ncannot but choose to act always according to this knowledge, he\ncontinues:\nIt being as truly impossible for such a free agent, who is\nabsolutely incapable of being deceived or depraved, to choose, by\nacting contrary to these laws, to destroy its own perfections; as for\nnecessary existence to be able to destroy its own being (1738,\n122).\n\n\nHe then draws the obvious conclusion.\nFrom hence it follows, that though God is both perfectly\nfree and infinitely powerful, yet he cannot possibly do any thing that\nis evil. The reason of this also is evident. Because, as it is\nmanifest infinite power cannot extend to natural contradictions, which\nimply a destruction of that very power by which they must be supposed\nto be elected; so neither can it extend to moral contradictions, which\nimply a destruction of some other attributes, as necessarily belonging\nto the divine nature as power. I have already shown that justice,\ngoodness and truth are necessarily in God; even as necessarily as\npower, understanding, and knowledge of the nature of things. It is\ntherefore as impossible and contradictory to suppose his will should\nchoose to do any thing contrary to justice, goodness, or truth; as\nthat his power should be able to do any thing inconsistent with power\n(1738, 122).\n\n\nThe conclusion implied by these remarks is that God's liberty is\ncurtailed by his perfect goodness. If choosing to do something rules\nout his being perfectly good, then it is not in his power to choose to\ndo that thing. He necessarily, not freely, chooses not to do that\nthing. This is the conclusion stated above. Clarke, however, rejects\nthis conclusion, insisting instead that God's liberty is not in the\nleast diminished.\nIt is no diminution of power not to be able to do things\nwhich are no object of power. And it is in like manner no diminution\neither of power or liberty to have such a perfect and unalterable\nrectitude of will as never possibly to choose to do anything\ninconsistent with that rectitude (1738, 122).\n\n\nOur final question is whether Clarke can successfully defend this\nresponse. As is clear, the response depends on an analogy between\nbeing perfectly powerful (omnipotent) and being perfectly free. His\nargument can be understood as follows. There are some things God\ncannot do. He cannot make a square circle. Nor can he choose to do\nevil. In the first case, his making a square circle is impossible\nbecause the idea of a square circle is contradictory. In the second\ncase, the contradiction is in the idea of a perfectly good being\nchoosing to do evil. Since a contradiction is involved in each case,\nGod's power is held to extend neither to making a square circle nor to\nchoosing to do evil. For God's power extends only to what is not\ncontradictory for a maximally perfect being to do. Clarke then claims\nthat the fact that God's power does not extend to making a square\ncircle or choosing to do evil does not imply any diminution of\npower. And by analogy he infers that it does not imply any diminution\nof liberty in God.\n\n\nSuppose we agree that God's inability to choose to do evil is not a\ndiminution of power. Can it also be true that his inability to choose\nto do evil is no diminution of freedom? No. For on Clarke's account of\nthe nature of freedom, the power to choose otherwise is necessary for\na choice to be free. Therefore, if it is not in God's power to choose\nto do evil, God does not freely choose not to do evil. And if it is\nnot in God's power to choose to act contrary to what is best, God does\nnot freely choose to do what is best. Perhaps Clarke can save God's\nomnipotence by saying that his power does not extend to acts\ninconsistent with any of his essential attributes. But this won't\nleave his perfect freedom intact. So long as he lacks the power to\nchoose to do evil, he lacks freedom in choosing not to do evil. And so\nlong as he lacks the power to choose contrary to what is best, he\nlacks freedom in choosing to do what is best. It won't matter whether\nthis lack of power results from a deficiency in his power or from the\nfact that his power does not extend to such choices. Clarke might be\nable to patch this up by changing his account of the nature of\nfreedom: declaring instead that one chooses freely just in case one\nhas the power to choose otherwise provided infinite power extends to\nthe choice to do otherwise. This move will avoid the immediate\nconclusion that God does not freely choose to do the best. For Clarke\nholds that God's infinite power does not extend to choosing contrary\nto what he knows to be best.  But since God's choosing to do what is\nbest is absolutely necessary for God, we are left with no reason at\nall to insist that his choice is really free. Nor are we left with any\nreason to thank God or be grateful to him for choosing and acting in\naccordance with his knowledge of what is best. Thus, Clarke's valiant\neffort to reconcile God's perfect liberty with his perfect goodness is\nunsuccessful. [Most of the material in sections 1-3 is taken (with\npermission) from my essay: \u201cClarke and Leibniz on Divine\nPerfection and Freedom,\u201d Enlightenment and Dissent, (Special\nIssue on Samuel Clarke), No. 16, 1997, 60-82.]\n4. Can God be free with respect to causing his own nature?\n\n\nOn the assumption that God (the supremely perfect being) exists and\nthat there is a best, creatable world, it appears that God is neither\nfree not to create a world nor free to create a world less than the\nbest creatable world. Indeed, it appears that God would of necessity\ncreate the best of the creatable worlds, leaving us with no basis for\nthanking him, or praising him for creating the world he does. For\ngiven that God exists and that there is a best creatable world, God's\n\u201cnature\u201d as an omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good\nbeing would require him to create that best world. Doing less than the\nbest he can do \u2014 create the best world \u2014 would be\ninconsistent with his being the perfect being he is. But what if,\nstrange as it may seem, God is causally responsible for having the\nperfect nature that he has? What if God creates his nature, and, by\nvirtue of having created it, is thereby causally responsible for his\nown nature? Such a view, if it were correct, might provide a way out\nof the problem of divine freedom.  For the problem seems to rest on\nthe plausible assumption that no being is, or can be, responsible for\nhaving the nature it has. And, given that this assumption is correct,\nwhat logically follows from God's possessing the nature (being\nsupremely perfect) he does \u2014 i.e, his creating the best possible\nworld \u2014 can no more be up to him, something he is responsible\nfor, than is his nature as a supremely perfect being something that is\nup to him, something he is responsible for. But against this\nassumption, Thomas Morris (Morris, 1987) has argued that God does\ncreate his nature and, therefore, is causally responsible for his\nnature. Suppose Morris is right: that God is responsible for his own\nnature. Well then, since God is responsible for his nature, he may\nthen be responsible for what is required by his nature. In short, God\nmay be responsible for his creation of the best world. So, it seems to\nmatter whether God is responsible for having the nature he has.\n\n\nOf course, in the broad sense of the expression \u201ca person's\nnature\u201d someone may be responsible for his nature, or at least\npart of it. A person with a naturally friendly disposition toward\nstrangers may have played a role in developing his\n\u201cnature\u201d to be friendly toward strangers, and thus may\nbear some responsibility for his \u201cnature\u201d to be friendly\ntoward others. But no one, it seems, is responsible for being the\nbasic sort of entity one is \u2014 a human being, for example. Thus,\neven God, so it is generally thought, is not causally responsible for\nhis basic nature \u2014 his being omnipotent, omniscient, and\nperfectly good. Of course, unlike humans, God, if he exists, does not\ninherit his nature from prior beings. For God is eternal and not\ngenerated by other gods. From eternity this uncreated being has been\nomnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good.  These properties\nconstitute his intrinsic nature. Thus it seems that no one, including\nGod, could be causally responsible for God's having the basic\nproperties that are constitutive of his nature. Against this view,\nhowever, Thomas Morris has argued that there is nothing logically or\nmetaphysically objectionable about God's creating, and thereby being\ncausally responsible for, his own basic nature. He does, however, wish\nto avoid having to claim that God is the cause of himself. As he says,\n\u201cthe very idea of self-causation or self-creation is almost\nuniversally characterized as absurd, incoherent, or worse.\u201d What\nMorris means here is that although it is absurd to think that God\ncauses himself to exist from all eternity, it is not absurd, in his\njudgment, to suppose that God (1) causes there to be such properties\nas omnipotence, omniscience, and perfect goodness, and (2) causes\nhimself to eternally possess these properties.\n\n\nIn Morris's proposal, God is said to be the cause of something (his\nnature) that God cannot possibly exist without. But it may seem\nimpossible for any being to be the cause ofsomething (its nature)\nwhich that very being cannot exist without. Therefore, it may seem\nimpossible for God to be causally responsible for his nature. Indeed,\n(to stress the point again) since God's nature consists of his\nessential properties, properties he must have in order to exist, it\nseems absurd to even suggest that God is causally responsible for\nthese properties and for his possession of them. Morris responds to\nthis objection by noting that God necessarily exists and therefore\nalways has his essential properties. So, we should not think that God\ncould exist without his nature and then cause the properties\nconstituting his nature (absolute goodness, absolute power, and\nabsolute knowledge) and cause himself to possess them. Nevertheless,\nMorris claims that the fact that God can exist only if his nature also\nexists doesn't preclude God's being causally responsible for his\nnature. He simply is always causally responsible for these properties\nand his essential possession of them. As Morris puts it: \u201cIt\njust seems to be that there is nothing logically or metaphysically\nobjectionable about God's creating his own nature \u2026.\u201d\n(Morris, 48)\n\n\nSuppose Morris is right about this issue \u2014 that God is\ncreatively responsible for the existence of properties, relations,\nmathematical truths, logical truths, necessary states of affairs,\npossible states of affairs, etc. Nevertheless, it may still be true\nthat God's causing of his nature was not itself up to God. For, on\nMorris's view, although God creates the entire framework of reality,\nit was not up to God whether to create the framework he did or some\nother framework instead, or even not to create any part of the\nframework he created. God never had a choice about creating this\nframework or any part of it for, in Morris's words, \u201cGod's\ncreation of the framework of reality is both eternal and necessary\n\u2014 it never was, never will be, and could not have been, other\nthan it is.\u201d (Morris, 170) Clearly, if God's creation of the\nframework of reality never could have been other than it is, then God\nnever had any choice about creating the framework of reality. He\ncreated it of necessity, and not freely.\n\n\nMorris is very much aware of the difficulty just noted. His response\nto it is direct and to the point. Referring to God's creation of the\nframework of reality, he writes:\nBut there is a sense, a different sense, in which even it\ncan be considered free. It is an activity which is conscious,\nintentional, and neither constrained nor compelled by anything\nexisting independent of God and his causally efficacious power. The\nnecessity of his creating the framework is not imposed on him from\nwithout, but rather is a feature and result of the nature of his own\nactivity itself, which is a function of what he is. (Morris,\n170-171)\n\n\nMorris recognizes, apparently, that the primary sense in which an\nagent is free in performing an action requires that the agent either\n(a) could have refrained from performing that action or, at least, (b)\ncould have refrained from causing his decision to perform that action.\nAnd it is this sense of being free in performing an action that\nconstitutes a necessary condition for an agent's being morally\nresponsible for an action he performs. (Morris shares the view\nexpressed here: that the libertarian idea of freedom is essential to\nmoral responsibility.)\n\n\nIn the primary sense of \u2018being free in performing an\naction,\u2019 \u2014 the sense required for moral responsibility\n(according to the libertarian view of moral responsibility) \u2014\nthe power not to have caused the decision to act is necessary. For\nwithout such power the agent has no control over her performing an\naction. It is not up to the agent whether she causes or does not cause\nher decision and subsequent action. And without such power on God's\npart with respect to his \u201ccreation\u201d of the framework of\nreality, it makes no sense to thank God or praise God for creating\nthat eternal framework. Only in some Pickwickian sense could we view\nGod as \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the creation of the\nframework of reality. This is not to deny the distinction Morris draws\nbetween God and the necessary truths constituting the framework of\nreality. God is causally active in a way in which a necessary truth\nsuch as Clarke's example \u2014 there being innocent beings who do\nnot suffer eternally is necessarily better than there being innocent\nbeings who do suffer eternally -is not. But for all Morris says about\nthe matter, God has no choice but to form the thought that there being\ninnocent beings who do not suffer eternally is necessarily better than\nthere being innocent beings who do suffer eternally. And God has no\nchoice but to acknowledge the truth of this thought. Neither of these\ndoings on God's part \u2014 having that thought, acknowledging its\ntruth \u2014 is any more up to God than it is up to a leaf whether or\nnot it moves when the wind blows against it. Neither the leaf nor God\nhas any choice in the matter.\n\n\nMorris believes that God can be the cause of his own nature. By this\nhe means that God is both the cause of the properties (omniscience,\nomnipotence, and perfect goodness) and the cause of God's having those\nproperties. Indeed, Morris holds that God is the cause of all the\nelements constituting the framework of reality. Furthermore, Morris is\nwell aware that God has no control over either his causing the divine\nproperties or his having those properties. The primary sense in which\nwe say that an agent is free in doing something requires that at the\ntime he did it the agent could have avoided doing what he did or could\nhave avoided causing his decision to do that thing. It is this sense\nof having control that many philosophers hold to be essential if an\nagent is to be morally responsible for his decision and action. [I\nignore here cases of \u201cderivative responsibility,\u201d where an\nagent freely and knowingly causes himself to be in a situation where\nhe is caused to will to do X and cannot refrain from willing\nto do X. In such cases the agent can be said, in a derivative\nsense, to be morally responsible for what he now must do, for the\nagent freely put himself in circumstances that he knew would\nnecessitate his act.]  And it is because God is not free (in the sense\nrequired for moral responsibility) when he performs actions\nnecessitated by his absolute perfections that it makes no sense to\nthank God or praise him for doing those actions. It is true, however,\nas Morris points out, that God's having no choice either about\ncreating the framework of reality or about having the properties of\nabsolute power, knowledge, and goodness, does not result from\nsomething else imposing this framework and properties upon him. And\nthis seems to distinguish God from the leaf that has no choice about\nmoving when the wind blows. The necessity of the leaf's moving is\nimposed on it by something else (the wind). The necessity of God's\ndoing what is best is imposed by God's nature, his being perfectly\ngood, something that is internal to God and something that, on\nMorris's account, God himself causes, but had no choice about\ncausing. So, unlike the leaf's being caused to move by something else\n(the wind), God, we may say, necessarily does what is best because\ngiven his perfect nature he cannot do other than the best. And\nalthough God causes his eternal possession of his perfect nature he\nhad no choice about eternally causing himself to be perfect. Consider\nthe question: Does God have any more of a choice about doing what is\nbest than the leaf, were it endowed with consciousness, would have\nabout moving when the wind blows? It is apparent that the answer must\nbe \u201cNo.\u201d For each necessarily does what it does as a\nresult of factors over which neither has any control. And that being\nso, it may be that God is no more morally responsible for choosing to\ndo what is best than the leaf is for moving when the wind blows. But\neven it this should be so, the view Morris presents is a significant\naddition to the literature on the problem of divine freedom.\n5. Alternatives to creating the best possible world.\n\n\nIn an important and influential essay, Robert Adams argues that even\nif there is a best creatable world, God need not create it. He\nsupposes that the world God creates contains creatures each of whom is\nas happy as it is in any possible world in which it exists. Moreover,\nno creature in this world is so miserable that it would be better had\nit not existed. Adams then supposes that there is some other possible\nworld with different creatures that exceeds this world in its degree\nof happiness, a world that God could have created. So, God has created\na world with a lesser degree of happiness than he could have. Has God\nwronged anyone in creating this world? Adams argues that God cannot\nhave wronged the creatures in the other possible world, for merely\npossible beings don't have rights. Nor can he have wronged the\ncreatures in the world he has created, for their lives could not be\nmade more happy. Adams notes that God would have done something wrong\nin creating this world were the following principle true.\nIt is wrong to bring into existence, knowingly, a being\nless excellent than one could have brought into existence (Adams, 1972,\n329).\n\n\nBut this principle, Adams argues, is subject to counter-examples.\nParents do no wrong, he points out, when they refrain from taking drugs\nthat would result in an abnormal gene structure in their children, even\nthough taking the drugs would result in children who are superhuman\nboth in intelligence and in prospects for happiness. As opposed to the\nincorrect principle just cited, Adams does support the more plausible\nprinciple:\nIt is wrong for human beings to cause, knowingly and\nvoluntarily, the procreation of an offspring of human parents which is\nnotably deficient, by comparison with normal human beings, in mental\nand physical capacity (Adams, 1972, 330).\n\n\nFrom these sensible observations concerning what would be right or\nwrong for humans to do in producing offspring, Adams infers that God\nwould not be doing something wrong in bringing into existence humans\nwho are less excellent than he could have brought into existence. But\nbefore we accept this inference, we should note an important\ndifference between God's situation in considering creating human\nbeings and the situation of parents who are considering taking drugs\nin order to bring into existence children who are superhuman both in\nintelligence and in prospects for happiness. In the latter case there\nis an inherited background of existing children who are brought about\nin normal ways and who establish what is normal with respect to human\nintelligence and prospects for happiness. Against this established\nbackground both of normal ways of producing children and of what is\nnormal in the way of intelligence and prospects of happiness, it is\nquite sensible to conclude that parents are under no obligation to\nproduce non-normal children who are superhuman both in intelligence\nand in prospects for happiness. For we cannot help but think that they\nwould be producing beings who would be strangely different, if not\nestranged, from much of the human race, the humans who are normal both\nin intelligence and in prospects for happiness. But in creating human\ncreatures it is God himself who establishes what the norm of human\nintelligence will be and what the prospects for human happiness will\nbe. There is no already existing norm from which God may choose to\ndeviate either by creating beings who are subhuman or superhuman in\nthe way of intelligence and prospects of happiness. Within the limits\nof what it is to be human it is up to God to set the norm for human\nintelligence and prospects for happiness. And if we suppose there is a\nlower and upper limit for human intelligence and happiness, the\nquestion is whether God would be doing something wrong in creating\nhumans whose prospects for intelligence and happiness are rather low,\nor in the middle, given that he could have created other humans with\nprospects for a considerably higher level of intelligence and\nhappiness. We grant that God may not have wronged the humans he did\ncreate, since, as Adams supposes, they could not have been created\nwith any greater prospects for a good and happy life. But it remains\ndifficult to see how God would be justified in creating creatures\nwhose prospects for a good life are known by him to be mediocre in\ncomparison with other creatures of the same species whose prospects\nfor a good life are known by him to be much greater \u2014 given that\nthis knowledge is all that is relevant to God's decision about which\ncreatures to create. In my judgment, Adams's analogy fails to address\nthis more serious question and, by implication, fails to address the\nserious question of whether God would be obligated to create the best\nworld.\n\n\nSuppose, however, that we set aside whatever disagreements we may have\nwith Adams on these points and accept the conclusion of his\nreasoning. Suppose, that is, that we agree with Adams that God is not\nmorally obligated to create the best world that he can, that it would\nbe morally permissible for God to create the best world he can, but\nalso morally permissible for God to create any of a number of other\ngood worlds of the sort Adams describes. If so, can't we conclude that\nthere is no unresolvable conflict between God's being essentially\nmorally perfect and his enjoying a significant degree of genuine\nfreedom? For it now appears that God's moral perfection does not\nrequire him to create the best world. In short, he is free to create\n(or not create) any of a number of good worlds.\n\n\nAs forceful and persuasive as Adams's arguments may be, I don't think\nthey yield the conclusion that God's perfect goodness leaves God free\nto create less than the best world that he can create. What Adams's\narguments show, at best, is that God's moral perfection imposes no\nmoral obligation on God to create the best world he can. His arguments\nestablish, at best, that God need not be doing anything morally wrong\nin creating some world other than the best world. But this isn't quite\nthe same thing as showing that God's perfect goodness does not render\nit necessary that he create the best world he can. For, even conceding\nthe points Adams makes, there still may be an inconsistency in a\nmorally perfect being creating some world other than the best world he\ncan create. The point here is this. One being may be morally better\nthan another even though it is not better by virtue of the performance\nof some obligation that the other failed to perform. It may be morally\nbetter by virtue of performing some supererogatory act \u2014 a good\nact beyond the call of duty \u2014 that the other being could have\nbut did not perform. Analogously, a being who creates a better world\nthan another being may be morally better, even though the being who\ncreates the inferior world does not thereby do anything wrong.\nFollowing Philip Quinn, I'm inclined to think that if an all-powerful,\nall-knowing being creates some world other than the best world it can\ncreate, then it is possible there should exist a being morally better\nthan it is. Quinn remarks: \u201cAn omnipotent moral agent can\nactualize any actualizable world. If he actualizes one than which\nthere is a morally better, he does not do the best he can, morally\nspeaking, and so it is possible that there is an agent morally better\nthan he is, namely an omnipotent moral agent who actualizes one of\nthose morally better worlds\u201d (Quinn, 213). (We should note that\nmy version of Quinn's principle is presented in terms of the overall\ngoodness of a world, not just its moral goodness. Thus, my version of\nthe principle states that if an omniscient being creates a world when\nthere is a better world it could create, then it would be possible for\nthere to be a being morally better than it. I do not, as Quinn does,\nfocus solely on the moral status of a world. For some good states of\naffairs include nonmoral goods such as happiness, as well as moral\ngoods such as the exercise of virtue. It could be, however, that the\ndifference is merely terminological, for Quinn may hold that the moral\nstatus of a world depends on both the moral and nonmoral good the\nworld contains.) For it would be possible for there to be an\nomnipotent being who creates the best world that the first being could\ncreate but did not. Shouldn't we then conclude that if an essentially\nall-powerful, all-knowing, perfectly good being creates any world at\nall, it must create the best world it can? For although a being may do\nno wrong in creating less than the best it can create, a being whose\nnature is to be perfectly good is not such that it is possible for\nthere to be a being morally better than it. If, however, a being were\nto create a world when there is a better world it could create, then\nit would be possible for there to be a being morally better than\nit.\n\n\nThe heart of Adams's essay, however, proposes a reason for rejecting\nthe view we have just stated: that if a being were to create a world\nwhen there is a better world it could create, then it would be\npossible for there to be a being morally better than it. For that view\nimplies, in Adams's words, that \u201cthe creator's choice of an\ninferior world must manifest a defect of character.\u201d And his\nresponse to this objection is that \u201cGod's choice of a less\nexcellent world could be accounted for in terms of His grace, which is\nconsidered a virtue rather than a defect of character in\nJudeo-Christian ethics\u201d (Adams, 1972, 318-319). It is Adams's\nunderstanding of the Judeo-Christian view of grace that lies at the\ncore of his objection to the Liebnizian view that the most perfect\nbeing \u201ccannot fail to act in the most perfect way, and\nconsequently to choose the best.\u201d So, any answer to Adams's view\nthat God need not choose to create the best world must take into\naccount his view that the Judeo-Christian view of grace implies that\nGod may create a world less than the best.\n\n\nAdams's defines the concept of grace as \u201ca disposition to love\nwhich is not dependent on the merit of the person loved\u201d (Adams,\n1972, 324). Given this definition and given two worlds,\nW1 and W2, that differ in that\nthe persons in W1 are happier and more disposed to\nbehave morally than are the persons in W2, with\nthe result, let us suppose, that W1 is a better\nworld than W2, it is clear that a gracious God\nwould not love the persons in W1 more than the\npersons in W2. Or, at the very least, it is clear\nthat were God to love the persons in W1 more than\nthe persons in W2 it would not be because they are\nmorally better and/or happier. As Adams remarks: \u201cThe gracious\nperson loves without worrying about whether the person he loves is\nworthy of his love\u201d (Adams, 1972, 324). So, by virtue of his\ngrace, either God would love all persons to an equal degree or the\nfact that he might love one person more than another would have\nnothing to do with the fact that the one has a greater degree of merit\nor excellence than another. As Adams puts it: \u201cthe gracious\nperson sees what is valuable in the person he loves, and does not\nworry about whether it is more or less valuable than what could be\nfound in someone else he might have loved\u201d (Adams, 1972,\n324). And he tells us that in the Judeo-Christian tradition grace is\nheld to be \u201ca virtue which God does have and men ought to\nhave\u201d (Adams, 1972, 324).\n\n\nGiven that grace is as Adams has defined it and that grace is a virtue\nGod possesses, what may we infer about the world God creates?  Can we\ninfer with Leibniz that if there is a best world God must create that\nworld? It is difficult to know what to say here. All that we've\nlearned from Adams thus far is that it would be something other than\nlove that would motivate God to choose the best world, or any other\nworld for that matter. For since grace is a disposition to love\nwithout regard to merit, God will be unable to select one world over\nanother if all he has to go on is his grace. His grace (love toward\ncreatures independent of their degree of merit) will leave him free to\ncreate any world that has creatures able to do moral good or evil,\nregardless of how good or bad they may be in that world. So, if God\nhas a reason to choose one creaturely world over another \u2014\nrather than blindly picking one out of the hat, so to speak \u2014\nthat reason will have little or nothing to do with his grace. For\ngiven the doctrine of grace, God's love for creatures is not based on\nthe quality (moral, religious, etc.)  of the lives they lead; and it\nis difficult to see what else about their lives it could be based\non. In fact, the implication of the Judeo-Christian doctrine of grace\nfor God's selection of a world to create seems to be entirely negative\n\u2014 rather than giving a reason why he might select a particular\ncreaturely world, or rule out other creaturely worlds, it simply tells\nus that if God creates a world with creatures, his love of the\ncreatures in that world cannot be his reason for creating it. For his\nlove for creatures is entirely independent of who they are and the\nkind of lives they lead. To base his love on who they are and the\nkinds of lives they lead would be to take those persons and their\nlives as more deserving of his love than other persons and their\nlives.\n\n\nWhat we've seen thus far is that God's grace \u2014 his love of\ncreatures without respect to their merit \u2014 cannot provide God\nwith a reason to create the best world, or any particular world less\nthan the best. And what this means is that whatever reason God has for\nchoosing to create one creaturely world over another cannot be found\nin his gracious love for creatures (For further argument in support of\nthis point see Thomas, 1996.) In what then, given that God has a\nreason for creating one world over another, would that reason reside?\nIt would reside not in God's gracious love but, I suggest, in his\ndesire to create the very best state of affairs that he can. Having\nsuch a desire, I believe, does not preclude gracious love. It does not\nimply that God cannot or does not equally love the worse creatures\nalong with the best creatures. Let me explain by using an analogy of\nmy own.  Loving parents may be disposed to love fully any child that\nis born to them, regardless of whatever talents that child is capable\nof developing. But such love is consistent with a preference for a\nchild who will be born whole, without mental or physical impairment, a\nchild who will develop his or her capacities for kindness toward\nothers, who will develop his or her tastes for music, good literature,\netc. And in like manner, God will graciously love any creature he\nmight choose to create, not just the best possible creatures. But that\ndoes not rule out God's having a preference for creating creatures who\nwill strive as creatures not only to have a good life but also to lead\na good life, creatures who will in their own way freely develop\nthemselves into \u201cchildren of God.\u201d Indeed, although God's\ngracious love extends to every possible creature, it would be odd to\nsuggest that he, therefore, could have no preference for creating a\nworld with such creatures over a world in which creatures use their\nfreedom to abuse others, use their talents to turn good into evil, and\ndevote their lives to selfish ends. Surely, God's graciously loving\nall possible creatures is not inconsistent with his having a\npreference to create a world with creatures who will use their freedom\nto pursue the best kind of human life. How could he not have such a\npreference? Furthermore, as I've suggested, if God had no such\npreference, his gracious love for creatures would give him no reason\nto select any particular possible world for creation. For his gracious\nlove for each and every creature fails to provide a reason to create\none creature rather than another, or to create the creatures in one\npossible world rather than those in another. So, if God is not reduced\nto playing dice with respect to selecting a world to create,there must\nbe some basis for his selection over and beyond his gracious love for\nall creatures, regardless of merit. And that basis, given God's nature\nas an absolutely perfect being, can only be, as Leibniz and Clarke\nmaintained, to do always what is \u201cbest and wisest\u201d to be\ndone. And surely the best and wisest for God to do is to create the\nbest world he can. Moreover, doing so seems to be entirely consistent\nwith God's gracious love of all creatures, regardless of their\nmerit.\n\n\nAdams, however, flatly rejects the view just described, a view that\nsees God's gracious love of creatures without respect to merit as\nentirely consistent with his having an all things considered\npreference to create the best world he can. After noting that divine\ngrace is love which is not dependent on the merit of the person loved,\nAdams proceeds to draw the conclusion that although God would be free\nto create the best creatures, he cannot have as his reason for\nchoosing to create them the fact that they are the best possible\ncreatures.\nGod's graciousness in creating does not imply that the\ncreatures He has chosen to create must be less excellent than the best\npossible. It implies, rather, that even if they are the best possible\ncreatures, that is not the ground for His choosing them. And it\nimplies that there is nothing in God's nature or character which would\nrequire Him to act on the principle of choosing the best possible\ncreatures to be the object of His creative powers (Adams, 1972,\n324).\n\n\nBy my lights, God's disposition to love independent of the merit of\nthe persons loved carries no implication as to what God's reason for\ncreating a particular world may be, other than that his reason cannot\nbe that he loves the beings in this world more (or less) than the\nbeings in other worlds. Moreover, having an all-things considered\npreference for creating the best world need not be rooted in a greater\nlove for beings who are better than other beings. For, owing to the\nPrinciple of Organic Unities (see Moore, pp. 187ff.) the best whole\nmay have some parts that are not the best. Therefore, the best world\nmay contain some human beings who are not better than, or even as good\nas, their replacements in the closest world to the best world. And God\nmay select creatures to create who will choose to grow morally and\nspiritually, rather than creatures who will choose not to grow morally\nand spiritually, and select them for that very reason without his\nthereby loving the former persons more than the latter, or loving them\nbecause of there greater merit. God's grace does rule out choosing to\ncreate the best world because he loves its inhabitants more than the\ninhabitants of some lesser world. But it does not rule out God's\nchoosing to create the best world because he prefers to create the\nbest persons, so long as he does not love them more than he loves the\ninhabitants of lesser worlds. Adams, of course, must be supposing that\nif God's reason for creating one world rather than another is the fact\nthat the creatures in the first world are much better than the\ncreatures in the second world, it somehow logically follows that God\nmust love the creatures in the first world more than he loves the\ncreatures in the second. But there is nothing in his presentation of\nthe view that God's love for creatures is independent of their merit\nthat yields this result. It seems, then, that there is no good reason\nto think that the Judeo-Christian concept of grace rules out the view\nof Leibniz and Clarke that God must create the best world, provided\nthere is a best world.\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there may be no best possible\nworld. Instead, it may be that for any world there is a better world.\nOr perhaps there are several equally good worlds than which no world\nis better. Still another seeming possibility is that there are\nincommensurate worlds,worlds such that no comparison in terms of\nbetter than is possible. Each of these possibilities has implications\nfor the question of divine freedom with respect to creation.\n",
