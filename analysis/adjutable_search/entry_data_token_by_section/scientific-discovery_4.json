The distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification\n\nThe distinction between \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and\n\u201ccontext of justification\u201d dominated and shaped the\ndiscussions about discovery in 20th-century philosophy of\nscience. The context distinction marks the distinction between the\ngeneration of a new idea or hypothesis and the defense (test,\nverification) of it. As the previous sections have shown, the\ndistinction among different elements of scientific inquiry has a long\nhistory but in the first half of the 20th century, the\ndistinction between the different features of scientific inquiry\nturned into a powerful demarcation criterion between\n\u201cgenuine\u201d philosophy and other fields of science studies,\nwhich became potent in philosophy of science. The boundary between\ncontext of discovery (the de facto thinking processes) and\ncontext of justification (the de jure defense of the\ncorrectness of these thoughts) was now understood to determine the\nscope of philosophy of science, whereby philosophy of science is\nconceived as a normative endeavor. Advocates of the context\ndistinction argue that the generation of a new idea is an intuitive,\nnonrational process; it cannot be subject to normative analysis.\nTherefore, the study of scientists\u2019 actual thinking can only be\nthe subject of psychology, sociology, and other empirical sciences.\nPhilosophy of science, by contrast, is exclusively concerned with the\ncontext of justification.\n\nThe terms \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and \u201ccontext of\njustification\u201d are often associated with Hans\nReichenbach\u2019s work. Reichenbach\u2019s original conception of\nthe context distinction is quite complex, however (Howard 2006;\nRichardson 2006). It does not map easily on to the disciplinary\ndistinction mentioned above, because for Reichenbach, philosophy of\nscience proper is partly descriptive. Reichenbach maintains that\nphilosophy of science includes a description of knowledge as it really\nis. Descriptive philosophy of science reconstructs scientists\u2019\nthinking processes in such a way that logical analysis can be\nperformed on them, and it thus prepares the ground for the evaluation\nof these thoughts (Reichenbach 1938: \u00a7 1). Discovery, by\ncontrast, is the object of empirical\u2014psychological,\nsociological\u2014study. According to Reichenbach, the empirical\nstudy of discoveries shows that processes of discovery often\ncorrespond to the principle of induction, but this is simply a\npsychological fact (Reichenbach 1938: 403).\n\nWhile the terms \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and \u201ccontext\nof justification\u201d are widely used, there has been ample\ndiscussion about how the distinction should be drawn and what their\nphilosophical significance is (c.f. Kordig 1978; Gutting 1980; Zahar\n1983; Leplin 1987; Hoyningen-Huene 1987; Weber 2005: chapter 3;\nSchickore and Steinle 2006). Most commonly, the distinction is\ninterpreted as a distinction between the process of conceiving a\ntheory and the assessment of that theory, specifically the assessment\nof the theory\u2019s epistemic support. This version of the\ndistinction is not necessarily interpreted as a temporal distinction.\nIn other words, it is not usually assumed that a theory is first fully\ndeveloped and then assessed. Rather, generation and assessment are two\ndifferent epistemic approaches to theory: the endeavor to articulate,\nflesh out, and develop its potential and the endeavor to assess its\nepistemic worth. Within the framework of the context distinction,\nthere are two main ways of conceptualizing the process of conceiving a\ntheory. The first option is to characterize the generation of new\nknowledge as an irrational act, a mysterious creative intuition, a\n\u201ceureka moment\u201d. The second option is to conceptualize the\ngeneration of new knowledge as an extended process that\nincludes a creative act as well as some process of\narticulating and developing the creative idea.\n\nBoth of these accounts of knowledge generation served as starting\npoints for arguments against the possibility of a philosophy of\ndiscovery. In line with the first option, philosophers have argued\nthat neither is it possible to prescribe a logical method that\nproduces new ideas nor is it possible to reconstruct logically the\nprocess of discovery. Only the process of testing is amenable to\nlogical investigation. This objection to philosophies of discovery has\nbeen called the \u201cdiscovery machine objection\u201d (Curd 1980:\n207). It is usually associated with Karl Popper\u2019s Logic of\nScientific Discovery.\n\n\nThe initial state, the act of conceiving or inventing a theory, seems\nto me neither to call for logical analysis not to be susceptible of\nit. The question how it happens that a new idea occurs to a\nman\u2014whether it is a musical theme, a dramatic conflict, or a\nscientific theory\u2014may be of great interest to empirical\npsychology; but it is irrelevant to the logical analysis of scientific\nknowledge. This latter is concerned not with questions of\nfact (Kant\u2019s quid facti?), but only with\nquestions of justification or validity (Kant\u2019s quid\njuris?). Its questions are of the following kind. Can a\nstatement be justified? And if so, how? Is it testable? Is it\nlogically dependent on certain other statements? Or does it perhaps\ncontradict them? [\u2026]Accordingly I shall distinguish sharply\nbetween the process of conceiving a new idea, and the methods and\nresults of examining it logically. As to the task of the logic of\nknowledge\u2014in contradistinction to the psychology of\nknowledge\u2014I shall proceed on the assumption that it consists\nsolely in investigating the methods employed in those systematic tests\nto which every new idea must be subjected if it is to be seriously\nentertained. (Popper 2002 [1934/1959]: 7\u20138)\n\n\nWith respect to the second way of conceptualizing knowledge\ngeneration, many philosophers argue in a similar fashion that because\nthe process of discovery involves an irrational, intuitive process,\nwhich cannot be examined logically, a logic of discovery cannot be\nconstrued. Other philosophers turn against the philosophy of discovery\neven though they explicitly acknowledge that discovery is an extended,\nreasoned process. They present a meta-philosophical objection\nargument, arguing that a theory of articulating and developing ideas\nis not a philosophical but a psychological or sociological theory. In\nthis perspective, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is understood as a\nretrospective label, which is attributed as a sign of accomplishment\nto some scientific endeavors. Sociological theories acknowledge that\ndiscovery is a collective achievement and the outcome of a process of\nnegotiation through which \u201cdiscovery stories\u201d are\nconstructed and certain knowledge claims are granted discovery status\n(Brannigan 1981; Schaffer 1986, 1994).\n\nThe impact of the context distinction on 20th-century\nstudies of scientific discovery and on philosophy of science more\ngenerally can hardly be overestimated. The view that the process of\ndiscovery (however construed) is outside the scope of philosophy of\nscience proper was widely shared amongst philosophers of science for\nmost of the 20th century. The last section shows that there\nwere some attempts to develop logics of discovery in the 1920s and\n1930s, especially in the pragmatist tradition. But for several\ndecades, the context distinction dictated what philosophy of science\nshould be about and how it should proceed. The dominant view was that\ntheories of mental operations or heuristics had no place in philosophy\nof science and that, therefore, discovery was not a legitimate topic\nfor philosophy of science. Until the last decades of the\n20th century, there were few attempts to challenge the\ndisciplinary distinction tied to the context distinction. Only during\nthe 1970s did the interest in philosophical approaches to discovery\nbegin to increase again. But the context distinction remained a\nchallenge for philosophies of discovery.\n\nThere are several lines of response to the disciplinary distinction\ntied to the context distinction. Each of these lines of response opens\na philosophical perspective on discovery. Each proceeds on the\nassumption that philosophy of science may legitimately include some\nform of analysis of actual reasoning patterns as well as\ninformation from empirical sciences such as cognitive science,\npsychology, and sociology. All of these responses reject the idea that\ndiscovery is nothing but a mystical event. Discovery is conceived as\nan analyzable reasoning process, not just as a creative leap by which\nnovel ideas spring into being fully formed. All of these responses\nagree that the procedures and methods for arriving at new hypotheses\nand ideas are no guarantee that the hypothesis or idea that is thus\nformed is necessarily the best or the correct one. Nonetheless, it is\nthe task of philosophy of science to provide rules for making this\nprocess better. All of these responses can be described as theories of\nproblem solving, whose ultimate goal is to make the generation of new\nideas and theories more efficient.\n\nBut the different approaches to scientific discovery employ different\nterminologies. In particular, the term \u201clogic\u201d of\ndiscovery is sometimes used in a narrow sense and sometimes broadly\nunderstood. In the narrow sense, \u201clogic\u201d of discovery is\nunderstood to refer to a set of formal, generally applicable rules by\nwhich novel ideas can be mechanically derived from existing data. In\nthe broad sense, \u201clogic\u201d of discovery refers to the\nschematic representation of reasoning procedures.\n\u201cLogical\u201d is just another term for \u201crational\u201d.\nMoreover, while each of these responses combines philosophical\nanalyses of scientific discovery with empirical research on actual\nhuman cognition, different sets of resources are mobilized, ranging\nfrom AI research and cognitive science to historical studies of\nproblem-solving procedures. Also, the responses parse the process of\nscientific inquiry differently. Often, scientific inquiry is regarded\nas having two aspects, viz. generation and assessments of new ideas.\nAt times, however, scientific inquiry is regarded as having three\naspects, namely generation, pursuit or articulation, and assessment of\nknowledge. In the latter framework, the label \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nis sometimes used to refer just to generation and sometimes to refer\nto both generation and pursuit.\n\nOne response to the challenge of the context distinction draws on a\nbroad understanding of the term \u201clogic\u201d to argue that we\ncannot but admit a general, domain-neutral logic if we do not want to\nassume that the success of science is a miracle (Jantzen 2016) and\nthat a logic of scientific discovery can be developed\n (section 6).\n Another response, drawing on a narrow understanding of the term\n\u201clogic\u201d, is to concede that there is no logic of\ndiscovery, i.e., no algorithm for generating new knowledge, but that\nthe process of discovery follows an identifiable, analyzable pattern\n (section 7).\n\nOthers argue that discovery is governed by a methodology. The\nmethodology of discovery is a legitimate topic for philosophical\nanalysis\n (section 8).\n Yet another response assumes that discovery is or at least involves a\ncreative act. Drawing on resources from cognitive science,\nneuroscience, computational research, and environmental and social\npsychology, philosophers have sought to demystify the cognitive\nprocesses involved in the generation of new ideas. Philosophers who\ntake this approach argue that scientific creativity is amenable to\nphilosophical analysis\n (section 9.1).\n\nAll these responses assume that there is more to discovery than a\neureka moment. Discovery comprises processes of articulating,\ndeveloping, and assessing the creative thought, as well as the\nscientific community\u2019s adjudication of what does, and does not,\ncount as \u201cdiscovery\u201d (Arabatzis 1996). These are the\nprocesses that can be examined with the tools of philosophical\nanalysis, augmented by input from other fields of science studies such\nas sociology, history, or cognitive science.\n",
