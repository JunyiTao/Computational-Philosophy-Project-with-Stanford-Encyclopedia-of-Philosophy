    "main_text": "\n\nAs an intellectual movement that exploded on the scene in\nmid-twentieth-century France, \u201cexistentialism\u201d is often\nviewed as a historically situated event that emerged against the\nbackdrop of the Second World War, the Nazi death camps, and the atomic\nbombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all of which created the\ncircumstances for what has been called \u201cthe existentialist\nmoment\u201d (Baert 2015), where an entire generation was forced to\nconfront the human condition and the anxiety-provoking givens of death,\nfreedom, and meaninglessness. Although the most popular voices of this\nmovement were French, most notably Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de\nBeauvoir, as well as compatriots such as Albert Camus, Gabriel Marcel,\nand Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the conceptual groundwork of the movement\nwas laid much earlier in the nineteenth century by pioneers like\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche and twentieth-century\nGerman philosophers like Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Karl\nJaspers as well as prominent Spanish intellectuals Jos\u00e9 Ortega y\nGasset and Miguel de Unamuno. The core ideas have also been illuminated\nin key literary works. Beyond the plays, short stories, and novels by\nFrench luminaries like Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, there were Parisian\nwriters such as Jean Genet and Andr\u00e9 Gide, the Russian novelists\nLeo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, the work of Norwegian authors such\nas Henrik Ibsen and Knut Hamsun, and the German-language iconoclasts\nFranz Kafka and Rainer Maria Rilke. The movement even found expression\nacross the pond in the work of the \u201clost generation\u201d of\nAmerican writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway,\nmid-century \u201cbeat\u201d authors like Jack Kerouac, Allen\nGinsburg, and William S. Burroughs, and the self-proclaimed\n\u201cAmerican existentialist,\u201d Norman Mailer (Cotkin 2003,\n185).\n\nWhat distinguishes existentialism from other movements in the\nintellectual history of the West is how it stretched far beyond the\nliterary and academic worlds. Its ideas are captured in films by Ingmar\nBergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean-Luc Goddard, Akira Kurosawa, and\nTerrence Malick. Its moods are expressed in the paintings of Edvard\nMunch, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and Edward\nHopper and in the vitiated forms of the sculptor Alberto Giocometti.\nIts emphasis on freedom and the struggle for self-creation informed the\nradical and emancipatory politics of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm\nX as well as the writings of Black intellectuals such as Ralph Ellison,\nRichard Wright, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Its engagement with the\nrelationship between faith and freedom and the incomprehensibility of\nGod shaped theological debates through the lectures and writings of\nKarl Barth, Paul Tillich, and Martin Buber, among others. And, with its\npenetrating analyses of anxiety and the importance of self-realization,\nthe movement has had a profound impact in the development of humanistic\nand existential approaches to psychotherapy in the work of a wide range\nof theorists, including R.D. Laing, Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, and Irvin\nYalom.\n\nWith this broad and diverse range of incarnations, it is difficult\nto explain what the term \u201cexistentialism\u201d refers to. The\nword, first introduced by Marcel in 1943, is certainly not a reference\nto a coherent system or philosophical\n school.[1]\nIndeed, the major contributors are\nanything but systematic and have widely divergent views, and of these,\nonly Sartre and Beauvoir explicitly self-identified as\n\u201cexistentialists.\u201d In surveying its representative\nthinkers, one finds secular and religious existentialists, philosophers\nwho embrace a conception of radical freedom and others who reject it.\nAnd there are those who regard our relations with others as largely\nmired in conflict and self-deception and others who recognize a deep\ncapacity for self-less love and interdependence. Given these disparate\nthreads and the fact that there is no unifying doctrine, one can\nnonetheless distill a set of overlapping ideas that bind the movement\ntogether.\n\nNihilism: The emergence of existentialism as an\nintellectual movement was influenced by the rise of nihilism in late\nnineteenth century Europe as the pre-modern religious worldview was\nreplaced with one that was increasingly secular and scientific. This\nhistorical transition resulted in the loss of a transcendent moral\nframework and contributed to the rise of modernity\u2019s signature\nexperiences: anxiety, alienation, boredom, and meaninglessness.\nEngagement vs. Detachment:\nAgainst a philosophical tradition that privileges the standpoint of\ntheoretical detachment and objectivity, existentialism generally begins\nin medias res, amidst our own situated, first-person\nexperience. The human condition is revealed through an examination of\nthe ways we concretely engage with the world in our everyday lives and\nstruggle to make sense of and give meaning to our existence.\nExistence Precedes Essence:\nExistentialists forward a novel conception of the self not as a\nsubstance or thing with some pre-given nature (or\n\u201cessence\u201d) but as a situated activity or way of being\nwhereby we are always in the process of making or creating who we are\nas our life unfolds. This means our essence is not given in advance; we\nare contingently thrown into existence and are burdened with the task\nof creating ourselves through our choices and actions.\nFreedom: Existentialists agree that what distinguishes\nour existence from that of other beings is that we are self-conscious\nand exist for ourselves, which means we are free and\nresponsible for who we are and what we do. This does not mean we are\nwholly undetermined but, rather, that we are always beyond or\nmore than ourselves because of our capacity to\ninterpret and give meaning to whatever limits or determines us.\nAuthenticity: Existentialists are critical of our\ningrained tendency to conform to the norms and expectations of the\npublic world because it prevents us from being authentic or true to\nourselves. An authentic life is one that is willing to break with\ntradition and social convention and courageously affirm the freedom\nand contingency of our condition. It is generally understood to refer\nto a life lived with a sense of urgency and commitment based on the\nmeaning-giving projects that matter to each of us as individuals. \nEthics: Although they reject the idea of moral absolutes\nand universalizing judgments about right conduct, existentialism\nshould not be dismissed for promoting moral nihilism. For the\nexistentialist, a moral or praiseworthy life is possible. It is one\nwhere we acknowledge and own up to our freedom, take full\nresponsibility for our choices, and act in such a way as to help\nothers realize their freedom.\n\nThese ideas serve to structure the entry.\n",
