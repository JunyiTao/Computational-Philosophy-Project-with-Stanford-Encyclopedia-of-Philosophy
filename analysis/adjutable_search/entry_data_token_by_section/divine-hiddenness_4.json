    "main_text": "The argument from the demographics of nonbelief\n5. The argument from the demographics of nonbelief\n\nAccording to Maitzen (2006),\n\nContemporary demographic data illustrate the lopsided distribution of\ntheistic belief. The populace of Saudi Arabia is at least 95 percent\nMuslim and therefore at least 95 percent theistic, while the populace\nof Thailand is 95 percent Buddhist and therefore at most 5 percent\ntheistic\u2026. If those data are even roughly accurate, the\ndistribution of theistic belief is at least highly uneven between\nthose two countries, and they are hardly unique in this respect.\n(179\u2013180)\n\n\nOther countries and geographic regions display an uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief, even though it is not as stark as it is in\nThailand and Saudi Arabia (Pew 2012). According to Maitzen, even if we\ngrant, just for the sake of argument, the success of some of the\ntheistically friendly explanations of nonbelief in individuals, none\nof them explain the \u201cgeographic patchiness\u201d of nonbelief.\nThat\u2019s because those explanations invoke motivations, attitudes,\nand dispositions that \u201cdo not cluster by country or culture so\nas to show up twenty times more often in Thailand than in Saudi\nArabia\u201d (Maitzen 2006: 184). After all, it\u2019s not as though\nthe Thai are twenty times more likely than the Saudis to be resistant\nto belief in God\u2019s existence, or in need of prompting to\nrecognize the wretchedness of life without God, or in need of the sort\nof risk that\u2019s required of a passionate faith in God; it\u2019s\nnot as though the Thai are twenty times more likely than the Saudis,\nupon coming to believe in God\u2019s existence, to be coerced into\nlove, trust, and obedience, or disposed to act out of improper motives\nlike fear of punishment, or be presumptuous in their relationship with\nGod, and so on (2006: 180\u2013185). Indeed, even if we grant, just\nfor the sake of argument again, that there is great value in a\ndiversity of belief and nonbelief in God\u2019s existence, \n\nwhy doesn\u2019t this valuable diversity flourish within the cultures\nof Saudi Arabia and Thailand? Naturalistic explanations, including\ncultural and political explanations offered by social science, have an\neasier time of it,\n\n\ncompared to theistic explanations since, on naturalism, \n\nthe patchiness of theistic belief has everything to do with the\nnotoriously haphazard play of human culture and politics and nothing\nto do with God: the messy, uneven data have messy, uneven causes.\n(2006: 183)\n\n\nMoreover, it seems implausible that God would be selective in the way\nGod related to different people groups, as though God took\nconsiderably more pains to make sure that those in the Middle East,\nrather than Thailand or China or India, came to belief. One would\nantecedently expect that God would have the motivation and wherewithal\nto treat all people equally on this score, which is hard to square\nwith God\u2019s love and justice. So it is that the demographics of\nnonbelief are better explained naturalistically than theistically, and\nso those demographics constitute evidence for atheism (cf. Zagzebski\n1994).\n\nBy way of reply, Marsh (2008) draws on Molinism in order to display\nhow the demographics of nonbelief might be more likely on theism than\nMaitzen suggests. According to Molinism, God knows what free creatures\nwould freely do in counterfactual situations, and God uses this\ninformation in the way God governs the universe. So, suppose that God\nknew that (i) there is a group of persons P\n\nthat are such that, no matter what creative act God had performed, if\nPs had existed, Ps would have freely rejected God in\ntheir earthly lives\n\n\nhad they believed, and \u201cthose genuinely deprived of the\nopportunity to believe in God in this world\u201d belong to that\ngroup (2008: 467). Furthermore, since God knows that \n\nthese individuals wouldn\u2019t come to love Him short of something\nlike a beatific vision, God sequesters them in order to secure their\neventual conversion,\n\n\nin an afterlife. God\u2019s decision to sequester them \u201clargely\ncashes out in terms of the geographic circumstances in which they are\nplaced\u201d, and keeps them \u201cinnocent for a later time, when\nthey will be in a position truly to love God\u201d upon coming to\nbelief (2008: 468). Finally, suppose that, given the counterfactual\nprofiles of each individual essence, there is no better distribution\nof belief and nonbelief than the actual one. In this theistically\nfriendly hypothesis, the demographics of nonbelief are at least as\nexpectable on theism as naturalism. Likewise for a Calvinist\nexplanation: \n\nDeterminism is true and souls may be divided into two kinds, the Elect\nand the Non-Elect. The Elects\u2019 souls are born into societal\nsituations in which they are determined to come to the ante\nmortem beliefs necessary for salvation; the non-Elects\u2019 are\nborn into societal situations in which they\u2019re not, indeed\nthey\u2019re determined to fail to come to these beliefs. (Mawson\n2012: 191\u2013192)\n\n\nMany theists will find Molinist and Calvinist explanations unappealing\nsince they depend on middle knowledge and double predestination\nrespectively. But another difficulty is that the strategy appears, at\nleast at first glance, more than a little bit offensive. One of the\ngreat triumphs of modern ethics is the widespread acknowledgement of\nthe moral reprehensibility of considering some people groups inferior\nto others. Postulating that non-theistic populations are comprised of\npeople who wouldn\u2019t respond appropriately to God no matter what,\nin this life, seems to flout this insight; and postulating that\nnon-theistic populations are comprised of people who are elect to\neternal damnation might be seen in the same light. (For further\ndiscussion, see Maitzen 2008; Mawson 2009, 2012.)\n\nMawson 2012 argues that, on theism, the demographics of nonbelief are\nexpectable, given either of two auxiliary hypotheses. First, suppose\nGod wants everyone to believe, but God wants much more everyone to\nbelieve without God\u2019s having to interfere with the freedom of\npeople. Of course, one of the things that people can use their freedom\nto do is either to spread theistic belief or to restrict the spread of\ntheistic belief. Given that people\u2019s receptivity to theistic\nbelief is dependent on the culture in which they are brought up and so\nforth, we\u2019d expect to find that belief and nonbelief are\ndistributed unevenly. Second, what if God wants more than anything\neveryone to believe, say, because it is necessary for salvation? In\nthat case, we must ask what \u201cdeadline\u201d God has set for\nsatisfying that desire. Mawson writes: \n\nThere are two plausible suggestions for \u201cdeadlines\u201d for\nGod: either that he has set for each individual his or her own\ndeadline and set it as the moment of his or her death, or that he has\nset us collectively one and the same deadline, the Eschaton/Last\nJudgment. (2012: 194)\n\n\nIf God\u2019s \u201cdeadline\u201d is the Last Judgment, then, once\nagain, it\u2019s not the least bit surprising that, since\npeople\u2019s receptivity to theistic belief is dependent on the\nculture in which they are brought up and so forth, belief and\nnonbelief are distributed unevenly. Oddly enough, Mawson does not\nmention a third deadline, the one that Schellenberg has been on about\nfor nearly three decades: the dawn of an individual\u2019s capacity\nto relate personally with God. If that were God\u2019s\n\u201cdeadline\u201d, would we still expect the uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief we find across the globe?\n\nBaker-Hytch (2016) argues that the uneven distribution of belief and\nnonbelief is about as likely on theism as on naturalism since (i) the\nprobability of that distribution on what we know about \u201cmutual\nepistemic dependence\u201d is high, (ii) the probability of what we\nknow about mutual epistemic dependence on \u201cinclusive\ntheism\u201d\u2014the view that the eternal destiny of human beings\nis not determined by what they believe at their natural\ndeaths\u2014is about the same as it is on naturalism, and (iii) the\nprobability of inclusive theism on theism is much higher than is\nnon-inclusive theism. See Talbot 2014 for a Christian defense of\n(iii).\n\nTo say that we are mutually epistemically dependent is to say\nthat we are \n\ncognitively constituted in such a way that it is a practical necessity\nthat we rely upon testimony for much of what we know about the world\nand in such a way, moreover, that we are liable to be significantly\ninfluenced by what those around us believe, particularly when it comes\nto matters that aren\u2019t readily susceptible to empirical\ninvestigation, including religious matters. (Baker-Hytch 2016: 376)\n\n\nMutual epistemic dependence, so understood, says Baker-Hytch, is a\nconsequence of, among other things, \u201ctwo types of cognitive bias\nthat play a significant role in determining how plausible we will tend\nto find a given item of testimony\u201d: context biases,\nsuch as conformity, prestige, and similarity biases, which together\nmake it much more likely that we accept the testimony of those we\npersonally trust and respect in our communities, and content\nbiases, stemming from the dominance of intuitive processing over\nreflective processing and the attractiveness of \u201cminimally\ncounterintuitive\u201d ideas, especially religious ones, which are\nmore likely to spread via testimony (Barrett 2011: 52\u201372;\nKahneman 2013; Boyer 2001: 87\u2013100). Thus, given mutual epistemic\ndependence, we would expect to see considerable divergence in the\ncontent of religious beliefs and clustering of those beliefs along\ngeographic and cultural lines. So, (i) seems supported.\n\nIn defense of (ii), Baker-Hytch argues that mutual epistemic\ndependence provides a balance between competing goods such as (a)\nexercising interpersonal trust and being invulnerable to deception,\n(b) sharing responsibility for one another\u2019s acquisition of\nepistemic goods and practicing epistemic self-reliance, and (c) having\nopportunities to acquire, practice, and perfect the intellectual\nvirtues and freedom from intellectual obstacles and challenges. Since\nmutual epistemic dependence provides a balance between goods such as\nthese, he claims it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if God were to bring\nit about; indeed, mutual epistemic dependence seems roughly as likely\non inclusive theism as it is on naturalism.\n\nAnother important social consideration for hiddenness arguments in\ngeneral has to do with \u201cdefeated evidence\u201d (cf. Anderson\n2017). Suppose that God provides sufficient evidence for one to\nbelieve that God exists but because we are a social species, another\nperson says or does something that causes one to think differently\nabout one\u2019s evidence. Suppose, for instance, that one is\nprovided with a misleading rebutting or undercutting defeater for\nevidence that would otherwise be sufficient to believe that God\nexists. One\u2019s evidence could be defeated by encountering\napparent peers with very different experiences and perspectives on the\nworld, and there is a significant overlap between divine hiddenness\nand the epistemology of disagreement (cf Matheson 2018). It is also\npossible, however, for one\u2019s evidence to be defeated by the\napparent consensus of those one interacts with. All other things being\nequal, it is usually not rational to believe differently than a\nmajority and especially a super-majority (cf. List 2014). It is at\nleast a question worth asking whether we should expect God not just to\nprovide evidence of God\u2019s existence but to defeat each defeater\nwe acquire through interacting with one another. If it is possible for\nGod to have a reason to allow us to be exposed to unchecked defeaters,\nit may be that there are broader social networks in which defeaters\naggregate or are easier to acquire and that God may have reason not to\nforbid them. \n",
