    "main_text": "The history of the term\n1. The history of the term\n\nThe received view, which takes the notion to originate in Arabic\nphilosophy, traces back to an article by the phenomenologist Herbert\nSpiegelberg, originally published in 1933 (for a translation of a\nrevised version, see Spiegelberg 1976). It turns entirely on\nphilosophical terminology: it only considers texts that use cognates\nof \u2018intention\u2019 in a specific technical sense, that of a\nmental act\u2019s being directed at or referring to\nsomething, in contrast with a usage that applies exclusively to\npractical contexts, where an agent intends to do something.\nSpiegelberg claims that before the high scholastic period, uses of the\nLatin intentio were exclusively practical and so have no\nbearing on the problem of the intentionality of mental states more\ngenerally. The closest antecedents, he claims, are the Arabic\nma\u2019na and ma\u2019qul, which were translated\ninto Latin in the high scholastic period by intentio.\n\nEven when considered simply as a history of the terminology, this\naccount is seriously mistaken. Late scholastic discussions often cite\nAugustine, in particular Book XI of his On the Trinity, in\nwhich intentio plays a central role. And while Augustine does\nidentify intentio there with will (uoluntas) and\neven love (amor), he does not have practical concerns\nexclusively or even primarily in mind. On the contrary, his focus is\non cognition, starting with vision and continuing on with memory,\nthought, and self-knowledge. It is just that he thinks that in order\nto account for the directedness of these states, their analysis must\nultimately include a certain practical element, rather than the other\nway around, where all practical attitudes must be explained in terms\nof cognition. Augustine argues that vision and perception generally\ncannot be analyzed simply into subject and object (as on\nAristotle\u2019s account). That would leave out something essential,\nwhich is needed to direct the sense to the perceptible object and keep\nit fixed on it. Augustine identifies this third element as the\nperceiver\u2019s intentio, which he characterizes as a kind of\nstriving or will. It is precisely because a trio of factors are\nrequired, in fact, that he believes psychology can be useful to\nTrinitarian theology. Since humans are made in God\u2019s image, each\nhuman (or more precisely, each \u201cinner man\u201d) must also\nreplicate God\u2019s triune structure. The role intentio\nplays in cognition is parallel to that of the Holy Spirit, mediating\nbetween the Father and the Son: it mediates between the object and the\ncognitive faculty. Later scholastics were thus right to cite\nAugustine\u2019s use of intentio in discussions of\ncognition, establishing a direct link to late antiquity, independent\nof the contributions of Arabic philosophy, in the history of what\nSpiegelberg called \u201cextra-practical\u201d intentionality.\n\nAugustine, moreover, is adapting and developing earlier Greek views.\nIn Book XII of his Literal Commentary on Genesis, he offers\nan extensive analysis of vision that relies heavily on Stoic theory.\nIn both theories, vision depends on the active role of the\nperceiver\u2019s pneuma (Greek) or spiritus (Latin),\n\u201cbreath\u201d in its original meaning and for the Stoics a kind\nof hot gaseous body, but for Augustine something immaterial. (The same\nwords, not insignificantly, are used in the Christian scriptures for\nthe Holy Spirit). Vision occurs when the pneuma extends\nthrough the optic nerve and the eye to the object, either by reaching\nout through the pupil to make contact with the object directly (as on\nAugustine\u2019s theory) or by pricking and tensing the intervening air\nbeginning at the pupil into a cone with its base at the object (as on\nthe Stoic theory). The words that the Stoic Chrysippus uses for the\nextension of the visual cone to the object are the Greek verb\nenteinein and noun entasis (Diogenes Laertius VII\n157), which are cognate with the Latin intendere and\nintentio. So if our goal was to find not just a continuous\ntransmission of technical terminology for intentionality, but cognates\nof intentio, we could trace it back at least to Greek\ntheories of vision in the third century bce,\nif not still earlier extromission theories of vision. (For further\ndiscussion of Augustine\u2019s theory, as well as the history of the\nterminology, see Caston 2001.)\n\nOther expressions and figures of speech familiar to us from modern\ndiscussions of intentionality can be found in ancient philosophy, even\nthough we cannot trace a continuous connection from them to our own\nusage. Throughout antiquity, for example, we find the antithesis of\n\u2018presence in absence\u2019 (par\u014dn ap\u014dn) to\ndescribe the way a mental state can make something\n\u201cpresent\u201d to the subject that is nevertheless absent from\nthe current surroundings and perhaps even from reality altogether.\nAristotle mentions such presence in absence explicitly as an\naporia or difficulty that must be resolved (On Memory and\nRecollection 1, 450a25 ff.). Certain Stoics speak of immanent\nobjects of thought, items that are literally present \u201cin\nthought\u201d (enno\u0113mata). Later thinkers use the\nphrase \u2018existing in mere thoughts alone\u2019 (en psilais\nepinoiais monais) to characterize merely intentional objects,\nwhich do not exist in reality. Even the metaphor of directedness\n\u2013 of aiming the mind at something (intendere animum\nin), like an arrow \u2013 can be found in ancient texts. In\nPlato\u2019s Cratylus (420b\u2013c),\nSocrates\nsuggests that the word for belief, doxa, derives\netymologically from the word for bow, toxon: it \u201cgoes\ntoward\u201d each thing and how it is in reality. Socrates then\nextends this analysis to the vocabulary for deliberative states: the\nword for plan, boul\u0113, for example, derives from the word\nfor shot, bol\u0113. The metaphor is repeated again in the\nTheaetetus (194a): someone who\nbelieves falsely is \u201clike a bad archer who, in shooting, goes\nwide of the mark and errs\u201d.\n",
