    "main_text": "Theoretical Difficulties\n7. Theoretical Difficulties\n\nWhile Grice viewed his ideas as tentative and exploratory, followers\nhave taken the theory to be well established. Indeed, it has served as\na paradigm for research in pragmatics. Serious difficulties have\nemerged, though.\n\nAccording to Grice\u2019s Theoretical Definition\n (\u00a76),\n conversational implicatures depend on a presumption that the speaker\nis observing the Cooperative Principle. W. Davis (1998: \u00a72.5)\nnotes, however, that speakers can engage in implicature when there is\nno conversation. All the figures and modes of speech can appear in\nprivate journals or in manuscripts that have little hope of being\nread.\n [38]\n\nThe Cooperative Principle further assumes that the participants in\nevery conversation strive only to achieve common goals. From the\nperspective of social psychology, evolutionary biology, and game\ntheory, Pinker (2007) and Asher & Lascarides (2013)\nobserve that pure cooperation is generally an unrealistic\nidealization or naive assumption. Conversations are often among\nadversaries, whose goals beyond communication are opposed. It would be\nfoolhardy and possibly dangerous for an interrogator to presume that a\nprisoner of war or terrorism suspect is being cooperative. Even when\nparticipants are friends or relatives, they often have some divergent\ngoals, and may give priority to other principles\n (\u00a710).\n To the extent that they diverge, the speaker\u2019s goals may be\npromoted and the hearer\u2019s goals thwarted by withholding\ninformation, providing misinformation, going off on a tangent, or\nbeing obscure. Even when it is correctly presumed that a speaker is\nnot being cooperative, the speaker may use all the figures and modes\nof speech. If the prosecuting attorney asks the defendant whether he\nwas in the bank on the day of the robbery, the defendant might answer\n\u201cI took my mother to the hospital that day\u201d, thereby\nimplicating that he was not at the bank. He may do this in the hope of\nmisleading the jury as well as the prosecutor. The official purpose of\nthe conversation is to get at the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\nbut the truth. But the defendant\u2019s purpose is to hide it.\n\nMany conversations have goals other than the exchange of information.\nOne is amusement, which speakers often pursue by making jokes (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: \u00a711.3). Because the goal is not to provide\ninformation, the maxims of Quality, Quantity, and Relation do not\napply. If for any of these reasons the Cooperative Principle does not\napply, reasoning based on it will be unsound.\n",
