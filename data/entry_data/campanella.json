    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nTommaso Campanella was born in Stilo, a town in Calabria, one of the\nsouthern regions of Italy, on September 5, 1568. At the age of 14 he\nentered the Dominican Order. In 1588, while in Cosenza, another\nCalabrian town, he read the treatise De rerum natura iuxta\npropriis principiis (On the Nature of Things According to\nTheir Own Principles, 1586) by Bernardino\nTelesio; and in the following months Campanella wrote his own\nPhilosophia sensibus demonstrata (Philosophy as\nDemonstrated by the Senses) in defense of this new philosophy of\nnature. In 1590 he was in Naples, where he made the acquaintance of\nGiambattista della Porta. He left for Rome in 1592 and then went to\nFlorence and Padua, where he met Galileo. Denounced to the\nInquisition, Campanella was arrested at the beginning of 1594 and in\nOctober was transferred to the Inquisition\u2019s prison in Rome. Condemned\non suspicion of heresy and forced to abjure, at the end of 1597 he was\nordered to return to Calabria. In the summer of 1598 he was again in\nStilo, where he soon became the inspiration behind a vast conspiracy\nagainst the Spanish, who at that time governed the Kingdom of Naples.\nIn August 1599 two of the conspirators revealed the plot to the\nSpanish viceroy, who sent armed forces into Calabria to repress it.\nCampanella was imprisoned and in November was moved to Naples, where\nhe was tried for heresy and rebellion. He managed to avoid the death\npenalty by feigning madness and was instead condemned to a lengthy\ndetention in various Neapolitan fortresses. During the years of his\nincarceration, he dedicated himself to intense literary activity,\ncomposing his most famous works, aimed at producing a new foundation\nfor the entire encyclopedia of knowledge. In 1612 he was visited by\nTobias Adami, a German man of letters from Saxony who took it upon\nhimself to publish some of Campanella\u2019s most important writings in\nFrankfurt from 1617 to 1623. After almost 27 years in prison,\nCampanella was released from the Castel Nuovo in 1626 and arrived in\nRome, where he remained in detention until early 1629. In October 1634\nhe was compelled to go into exile in France, following renewed Spanish\nsuspicions regarding him. In Paris he was received with favor by King\nLouis XIII and by Cardinal Richelieu and was able to frequent learned\ncircles. He wrote new political works and arranged for the printing of\nthe first volumes of his Opera omnia, a project that remained\nincomplete at his death on May 21, 1639.\n2. Criticism of Aristotle and Championing of Telesio\u2019s Natural Philosophy\n\nCampanella\u2019s first printed work, Philosophia sensibus\ndemonstrata, was written when the twenty-one year old Dominican\nfriar was living in a monastery in the Calabrian village of Altomonte.\nIt was published in Naples in 1591. The work is divided into eight\ndisputationes (\u2018disputations\u2019), in which he\ndefends Telesio\u2019s new philosophy of nature against the attack of the\nAristotelian Giacomo Antonio Marta. In the preface Campanella traces\nthe course of his intellectual development and presents the\n\u201cnew\u201d aspects of his own thought. It is no accident that\nthese pages begin with the word \u201ctruth,\u201d depicted\nallegorically on the title-page as a sphere floating on water, as\nwinds blowing from all sides threaten to submerge it and a young friar\nswims out to reach it. Truth can be hidden and persecuted, Campanella\nmaintains, but it cannot be held prisoner by injustice; in the end it\nemerges from the darkness and is once again resplendent. These\nintroductory pages offer us a lively account of the doubts of the\nyoung friar who, recalling the years he spent in Dominican monasteries\nin Calabria, cannot conceal his disillusionment. The works of ancient\nand modern philosophers have convinced him that human knowledge had\nbecome ever more obscure and confused because it had distanced itself\nprogressively from the direct experience of nature and had turned\ninstead to reading and commenting on books written by human beings.\nThis attitude was particularly evident in the followers of Aristotle\nwho directed their energies toward the words of their master, without\nattempting to compare them to the natural world. In this way\nphilosophical research had degenerated into sophistical disputes and a\nseries of pointless battles over words. Reflecting on all this, the\nyoung Campanella formed a conviction that he would never abandon: an\nadequate knowledge of things is one that comes from the things\nthemselves, which we must investigate on the basis of sense\nexperience.\n\nThis forms the context for his fundamental encounter with the\nphilosophy of Telesio. Reading the first edition of De rerum\nnatura iuxta propria principia, Campanella intuited, right from\nthe beginning, the novelty and cogency of Telesio\u2019s approach. In\naccordance with Campanella\u2019s own aspirations, Telesio believed in\nderiving the truth from a direct examination of natural facts, so that\nthe correct connections between words and things, which had gotten\nlost in the Aristotelian tradition, could now be re-established.\nReviving and developing, in an original manner, a time-honored\nmetaphor, Campanella affirmed that the philosophical investigator must\nread and study the \u201cbook of nature.\u201d In a famous\nsonnet\u2014he was also the author of an extraordinary collection of\nphilosophical poetry\u2014he stated: \u201cThe world is the book on\nwhich the Eternal Wisdom / wrote its own thoughts\u201d\n(Poesie, 1998, p. 46). In order to construct an authentic\nnatural philosophy, a continual comparison between the books written\nby human beings and the infinite book of nature was necessary, so as\nto correct the errors in the human \u201ccopies,\u201d that were\ninevitably imperfect, partial and consequently in need of revision. In\nanother sonnet, Campanella rendered homage to \u201cTelesio from\nCosenza\u201d (\u201cTelesio cosentino\u201d) for having used his\narrows to pierce and kill Aristotle, described as the \u201ctyrant of\nminds\u201d, and for having in this way restored to mankind the\nlibertas philosophandi (freedom to philosophize), which is\ninseparable from the truth (Poesie, 1998, p. 278).\n\nIn his own treatise, Philosophia sensibus demonstrata,\nCampanella produced a systematic critique of the axioms of\nAristotelian philosophy, bringing to light their limitations and\nincoherence on the physical, cosmological and metaphysical level, by\ndrawing on Telesian principles integrated with notions deriving from\nother philosophies. Campanella had a secure knowledge of Aristotle\u2019s\nworks and those of his commentators and followers, whether ancient\n(Themistius, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Philoponus), medieval (Averroes\nwas frequently cited alongside Thomas Aquinas and, above all, the\n\u201cdivine\u201d Albertus Magnus) or contemporary (such as\nAgostino Nifo). He re-evaluated the Presocratic philosophers, who had\nbeen criticized by Aristotle, and was well acquainted with medical\nwriters from Hippocrates and Galen to Pietro d\u2019Abano, Jean Fernel and\nVesalius. He had read the works of astronomers and of natural\nphilosophers\u2014Pliny the Elder\u2019s Natural History played a\nrole of primary importance for him. One of the authors most cited by\nCampanella, in close conjunction with the philosophy of Telesio, was\nMarsilio Ficino. He quoted in particular passages from Ficino\u2019s\ncommentaries on Plato (especially the Timaeus and\nSymposium) and on the Enneads of Plotinus.\n\nIn his attack on the Aristotelian tradition, Campanella criticized the\ndoctrines of form and of privation; of the four elements as principles\nof the sublunary world; of matter as privation; of the derivation of\ncelestial heat from the friction of the spheres; and of the\ndistinction between natural and violent motion. The culmination of his\nefforts to dismantle the Aristotelian system was a radical critique of\ntraditional cosmology, with regard both to the nature of the heavens\nand to the trajectories and mechanisms of celestial movements. In\nparallel to the destructive side of Campanella\u2019s argument, the\nconstructive element consisted of defending the doctrines of Telesio\u2019s\nphilosophy. According to Telesio, all being derived from modifications\nresulting from the actions of the two principles of hot and cold on\nmatter, which he did not regard as an abstract ens rationis\n(an entity existing in the mind) but rather as an inert corporeal\nmass, dark and entirely formless but capable of receiving any form.\nFrom the subtle and detailed argumentative structure of the eight\nweighty disputationes emerges a powerful unitary notion: the\ncentrality, nobility and primacy of solar heat, that connects all\nbeings and confers life on them. It is within this context that the\nassimilation of solar heat to the World Soul acquires a particular\nsignificance, a theme that is at the heart of the third disputation,\nentitled \u201cDe coelo et mundo\u201d (\u201cOn the heavens and\nthe world\u201d). Campanella here transcribes verbatim a passage from\nFicino\u2019s commentary on Plotinus\u2019s Enneads in which he dwells\non the World Soul and its \u201cvital and sensual breath\u201d\n(Philosophia sensibus demonstrata, pp. 322\u201323). Ficino\nassociates this hot breath, that penetrates and is infused into the\nentire world, with a well-known line from Virgil\u2019s Aeneid\n(VI.726: \u201cspiritus intus alit\u201d; \u201cthe spirit\nnourishes from within\u201d) and also with the divine spirit of\nGenesis 1:2: \u201cthe spirit of God moved upon the face of the\nwaters\u201d. The heavens are composed of this breath and divine\nword, that vivifies and nourishes everything.\n\nCampanella set out this philosophy of nature, inspired by Telesio but\nreworked in an original manner, in successive treatises such as the\nEpilogo magno (Great Epilogue), that, when\ntranslated into Latin, would become the \u201cPhysiologia,\u201d the\nfirst of the four parts of his Philosophia realis, first\npublished in Frankfurt in 1623; the other three parts were entitled\n\u201cEthica,\u201d \u201cPolitica\u201d and\n\u201cOeconomica\u201d. In the second and definitive edition,\npublished in Paris in 1637, all four parts, and in particular the\nfirst, were accompanied by numerous and lengthy quaestiones\nconcerning specific problems, in which the views of ancient and modern\nphilosophers were discussed. Campanella begins the\n\u201cPhysiologia\u201d by stating that when the first\nBeing\u2014most powerful, most wise and best\u2014decided to create\nthe world, defined as its \u201ceffigy\u201d and the\n\u201cimage\u201d of its infinite goods, it unfolded an\n\u201calmost infinite\u201d space in which that effigy was placed.\nThis occurred at the outset of that enduring vicissitude of things\nthat we call time and that is the image of eternity from which it\nflows. Space is defined as \u201ca primary substance or seat or\nimmobile and incorporeal capacity, able to receive any body.\u201d It\nis homogeneous: human terms such as \u201chigh\u201d and\n\u201clow\u201d, \u201cbehind and in front of\u201d,\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d, refer to bodies that are\nplaced within it; and if the world did not exist, we would imagine\nspace to be empty. In reality, however, it desires fullness, is\nendowed with attractive force and abhors remaining empty. Bodies, in\nturn, enjoy mutual contact and hate the void that separates them\n(Physiologia, in Opera latina, II, pp. 575\u201377).\n\nWithin space God places matter that in clear contrast to the\nconception of Aristotle and Averroes, who defined it as privation and\nas a pure ens rationis, is regarded by Campanella as a\nphysical entity, deprived of form, shape and action, but capable of\nbeing extended, divided, united and of assuming any shape, just as wax\ncan receive an impression from any seal. Into this corporeal mass God\ninserts heat and coldness, the two active principles, that are\nself-disseminating and incorporeal but can only subsist in bodies.\nFrom their conflict, deriving from the fact that each wants to take\npossession of and occupy the greatest possible quantity of matter,\ncome the two primary bodies and elements of the world: the heavens,\nthat are extremely hot, subtle and mobile, since they are formed of\nmatter transformed by heat; and the earth, composed of matter made\nimmobile, dark and dense by cold. The clash between the heavens and\nthe earth, between heat and coldness\u2014instruments and\n\u2018craftsmen\u2019 that God uses to produce the infinite modes of\nhis creative wisdom in the wondrous effigy that is the\nworld\u2014gives birth to all individual entities. By means of these\nprinciples Campanella explains every aspect of the natural world, from\ncelestial and meteorological phenomena to the formation of the waters,\nfrom the composition of minerals to that of plants. Animals and human\nbeings he analyzes with particular attention. At the origin of these\norganisms, that are more complex and have more parts, lies an\nespecially attenuated celestial heat, the spiritus.\nConsisting of matter made extremely subtle by solar heat, it is a warm\nbreath that, thanks to its tenuousness and motion, is able to separate\nitself from the portion of matter in which it finds itself enclosed\nand to act on it. Unable to exhale itself from corporeality in order\nto return to the heavens from which it has its origin, this plasma\nconstructs, in ways that suit its needs and avoid the external dangers\nthreatening it from within, the organs that guarantee its\nconservation and life. Proud of his medical knowledge (among his works\nis one entitled Medicina, made up of eight books and\npublished in Lyons in 1635), here and in other treatises Campanella\ndelighted in highlighting the wondrous structure of the human body and\nits parts, revealing how the functions and purposes specific and\nparticular to individual organs harmonize in the marvelous order of\nthe totality and confirm the presence of divine craftsmanship in every\nfiber of natural reality.\n3. The Sense of Things and Natural Magic\n\nOne aspect of Campanella\u2019s keen interest in natural philosophy was\nnatural magic, described with particular effectiveness in the fourth\nbook of his Del senso delle cose e della magia naturale\n(On the Sense of Things and On Natural Magic). The original\ndraft of this work goes back to the young friar\u2019s first stay in\nNaples, from 1590 to 1592. He came into contact there with\nGiambattista della Porta, one of the most celebrated Renaissance\nproponents of natural magic. The treatise was rewritten in the\nfollowing years and was published for the first time in Frankfurt in\n1620 in a Latin translation that was reprinted in Paris in 1636 and\n1637. The work had a notable European diffusion, provoking discussions\nand contrasting opinions. In this treatise Campanella set out his\nvision of the natural world as a living organism, whose individual\ncomponents partook of life, vitality and sensibility.\n\nThe central notion in the treatise is that of sensus (sense),\nwhich is directly connected to the principle of self-preservation.\nEvery being displays a tendency toward the conservation of its own\nlife and for this purpose is endowed, in varying proportions, with\nsense. This consists of the capacity to distinguish that which is\npositive and conducive to its life, and is consequently to be pursued\nand sought after, from that which is perceived as negative and\ndestructive, and consequently to be shunned and avoided. Some entities\nsuch as celestial bodies and light possess a sense that is much\nsharper and purer than that of animals. Others such as minerals and\nmetals have a sense that is more obtuse and obscure, due to the\nheaviness of matter. In animal organisms vital and cognitive functions\ndepend on the spiritus. Hot, mobile and passive, it is\nidentified with the organic soul. Rejecting the distinctions made by\nGalen between various abstract faculties, Campanella states that the\nspiritus is singular and has its seat in the brain, from\nwhere, flowing through very subtle nerve channels, it accomplishes its\nmultiple functions, both vital and cognitive. By means of the sense\norgans, it comes into contact with external reality; all passions and\ncognition derive from the modifications that it undergoes. Every\nsensation is a form of \u201ccontact\u201d on the part of the\nspiritus, that enters into a relation, via various sense\norgans, with the exhalations, motions and light coming from external\nobjects. The sensations that the spiritus experiences are the\nsource of all cognition: memory, imagination, reason and the intellect\nitself, which is nothing but weakened and distilled sense. There is no\nneed to postulate different and specific faculties for such\noperations, since they are all functions of the same sentient soul,\nthat is capable of preserving the modifications and impressions it\nreceives and of reviving and re-using them when similar situations\narise.\n\nWhen dealing with animals and human beings, Campanella underlies\naffinities as well as differences. He takes delight in producing\nevidence of the extraordinary capacities of animals. Furnished with\nsense organs that in some cases are superior to those of humans,\nanimals are able to achieve wondrous and ingenious things; they adopt\nforms of collective organization; they know how to make use of medical\nand military arts; moreover, they are endowed with a form of\nreasoning, of language, of natural prophecy and even of religion.\nThese analogies should not, however, obscure or cast doubt on the\nexcellence of the human condition. Humans are furnished with a\nspiritus that is far more refined and pure than that of\nanimals; it is able to move with agility within more spacious brain\ncells, enabling humans to develop more complex chains of argument. The\nauthentic and radical difference between animals and humans, however,\nconsists in the fact that the latter are endowed, not only with a\nspiritus, but also with an immaterial mens (mind) of\ndivine origin, that constitutes and is the basis of their specific\nmakeup. Humans do not exhaust all their capacities within the frame of\nthe natural world. They can project themselves by means of thought and\ndesire toward the infinite. They are able to go beyond the limits of\nnatural self-preservation and turn themselves toward higher goods and\nends. Above all, humans are free. In contrast to what happens to\nanimals, who are unable to disengage themselves from the demands of\nthe senses, humans can repel the compulsion of the passions in order\nto make choices that go beyond simple practical advantage and the\nimmediate satisfaction of needs. Humans can resist the siren song, as\ndid Ulysses who tied himself to the stake of reason.\n\nThe fourth book of Del senso delle cose is devoted to natural\nmagic. Approaching the theme of magic, Campanella begins by deploring\nthe vile and decadent condition into which this very noble science has\nfallen. In modern times, the name magician is given to\n\u201csuperstitious friends of demons\u201d who, instead of\ndedicating themselves to the patient study of nature, prefer to take a\n\u201cshort cut\u201d by asking demons for things that they cannot\nprovide but that they promise and pretend to be able to do. Della\nPorta\u2019s attempt to restore this doctrine was entirely praiseworthy but\nremained insufficient, because he restricted himself to speaking about\nthese arguments solely in a descriptive and empirical manner without\nsupplying philosophical explanations of phenomena. In listing the most\nbizarre occult properties of minerals, plants and animals in the\nmagical tradition, della Porta maintained that it was not possible to\noffer a rational explanation of the relations of sympathy and\nantipathy, of affinity and repulsion, that exist between natural\nentities and limited himself to delighting in the spectacle and\nentertainment provided by nature. Campanella, however, took it on\nhimself to reinterpret this tradition in light of his doctrine of the\nsense of things and of the spiritus. As Pliny the Elder had\nnoted (Natural History, XXX.i-ii), magic, an ancient form of\nwisdom of Persian origin, is constructed from the convergence of three\ndoctrines: religion, that purifies the soul and imprints faith, honor\nand reverence on the souls of those toward whom the magical operation\nis directed; medicine, that makes it possible to understand the powers\nof herbs, stones and metals; and, finally, astrology, a knowledge of\nwhich is indispensable for producing well-timed actions by selecting\nthe most favorable disposition of the stars. Magic is a wisdom that is\nat the same time speculative and practical, that applies its own body\nof knowledge to works that are useful to humankind. It can be divided\ninto three types: divine, natural, deceitful and diabolical. Essential\nboth for divine and natural magic is a genuine faith, which requires\npurity of heart and an intrinsic adherence on the part of the soul to\nthe divinity. Such faith, which renders human beings divine, confers\non them the capacity to perform operations on things and transform\nthem according to their own desires (Del senso delle cose,\npp. 221\u201322, 226\u201329). At the opposite pole to divine magic is the type\nthat is playful and deceitful, thanks to which charlatans skillfully\nproduce effects that stupefy ignorant people. These swindlers cause a\nleg to burst into flames, though in truth the leg is artificial; they\nplace a nail in their eye and another in their mouth, pretending that\nit has passed from one to the other; they seem to be pierced by fake\ndaggers and swords; and, using the laws of optics, they make it\npossible to see distant images.\n\nBeyond these deceits, that are believed to be genuine solely by the\nmasses and that turn out to be \u201cuseless fictions\u201d, the\nnucleus of the book is natural magic. On the one hand, it is connected\nto the arts and sciences: all wondrous inventions appear at first to\nbe the result of magical operations, until their true causes are\ndiscovered. On the other hand, its particular sphere is the knowledge\nof unusual and arcane events. Natural magic, by means of its body of\nknowledge, is able to produce specific alterations in the mobile and\ntenuous spiritus, which is capable of submitting to and\nreceiving any impression. The basic passions are pain and joy, love\nand hate, hope and fear. The magician is someone who has the ability\nto act on these passions by employing herbs, phrases, actions and\nanything else that might be suitable. This person will know how to\nincrease bodily powers, suggesting foods, drinks, climates, sounds,\nherbal and animal remedies that aid and strengthen vital energies and\ncounseling against anything that has to do with putrefaction and\ndeath.\n\nThe durability of sense in entities and in the air in latent\nforms\u2014as if asleep, waiting to be reawakened on specific\noccasions\u2014explains facts that are only apparently miraculous,\nsuch as the bleeding of a corpse in the presence of the murder: the\nvictim, if alerted through the air to the proximity of his killer, is\nagain agitated by anger and fear, discharging blood. Also linked to\nthe durability of affects and sense is the efficacy of the weapon\nsalve, attributed to Paracelsus, by means of which a wound can be\nhealed by putting ointment on the weapon that caused it, as if the\nspiritus enclosed in the wound acquires confidence by feeling\nthe cure via the air and experiences \u201calmost the joy of\nrevenge\u201d. It is also possible to explain a celebrated example\nfound in every book on magic: a drum made of sheep skin falls to\npieces when a drum made of wolf skin is sounded, reawakening its\nformer fear (Del senso delle cose, pp. 253\u201359).\n\nThe profound alterations that animal spirits can undergo explain the\ntrue and proper transformations that occur in someone who has been\nbitten by a rabid dog or in peasants from Puglia attacked by\ntarantulas. Campanella gives a very precise description of what\nhappens to those bitten by tarantulas, based on eye-witness accounts\nof the phenomenon: they become weak, dancing and jumping to the sound\nof various musical instruments, until they collapse in exhaustion. In\nboth cases acrid spirits introduced into the wound produce an\nalteration of the temperament and the imagination of the unfortunate\nvictims, in whose bodies the animal spirits of the creatures that have\nattacked them take the upper hand in a manner that is at variance with\nthose already there. By means of dancing and sweating, those bitten by\ntarantulas endeavor to expel the infected vapors. Usually, however,\nthe symptoms remain as long as the cause that produced them persists;\nand only the death of the spider that stung them will bring a true\nremission of their suffering. The connection between general and\nparticular causes is confirmed again by the odd case of the medical\nschool of Tropea in southern Italy, in which a nose was grafted onto a\nman who had lost his due to a wound. The doctors reconstructed the new\nnose from flesh taken from the arm of a servant. The new nose took\nroot and lived; but when the servant died, it putrefied, demonstrating\nthat the life that it had received from the new organism in which it\nwas inserted did not annihilate its original and deep-rooted\nconnection to the life of the servant.\n4. The Calabrian Conspiracy and Prophecy in The City of the Sun\n\nAfter having submitted to an inquest in Naples over his advocacy of\nTelesian philosophy in 1592, Campanella went first to Rome, then to\nFlorence and Padua, where, at the beginning of 1594, he was denounced\nand arrested for heresy. In October he was transferred to a prison of\nthe Roman Inquisition, in which the \u201cheretical\u201d Florentine\nFrancesco Pucci and the philosopher Giordano Bruno were imprisoned. In\na sonnet entitled \u201cAl carcere\u201d (\u201cTo Jail\u201d),\nCampanella could not but reflect on the fact that free spirits who,\nabandoning the stagnant waters of a traditional culture in order to\nhurl themselves boldly into the \u201csea of truth\u201d, found\nthemselves enclosed, as if by a tragic and fatal destiny, in the\ndismal palace of the Inquisition, that he compares to the cave of\nPolyphemus, the labyrinth of Crete and the palace of Atlas\n(Poesie, 1998, p. 254). Accused of supporting atomist and\natheist doctrines, he was condemned in 1595 \u201con grave suspicion\nof heresy\u201d and forced to make a formal public abjuration. At the\nend of 1597 the superiors of the Dominican Order commanded him to\nreturn to Calabria.\n\nAlmost thirty years of age and after ten years of absence, Campanella\nreturned to Stilo on August 15, 1598. The next year he was involved in\nthe most dramatic events of his life. He became convinced by his\nreading of astrological and prophet texts that announced profound\nchanges, by the appearance of abnormal celestial signs and natural\nevents and, above all, by the miserable and unjust condition of the\npopulation and by serious social and political disorders that the end\nof the century would bring a period of great upheaval. A vast\nconspiracy, of which he was indisputably the spiritual leader, was\norganized with the aim of transforming the province into a republic\nand removing it from the tyrannical rule of the king of Spain. The\nplot never got underway because on August 10, 1599 it was revealed to\nthe Spanish authorities by two of the conspirators. After frenzied\nattempts to escape, Campanella was arrested. In November four galleys\narrived at the port of Naples carrying dozens of prisoners. Some were\ndangling, having been hanged from banners; others were dismembered in\nthe port, a pitiless reminder to the crowd who, full of curiosity and\nhorror, had come to see the terrible spectacle.\n\nIn defending himself, Campanella firmly denied the accusation of\nrebellion, maintaining that he had not acted out of personal ambition\nor malevolence toward the king but rather had been following human and\ndivine prophecies. Astrological tables had predicted an unusual\nsuccession of eclipses in the first years of the new century.\nAccording to a famous prognostication, De eversione Europae,\nattributed to Antonius Arquatus, that had foretold events such as the\ncoming of Luther and the Sack of Rome, the Turks, after a period of\ncontinual ascent, at the time of their fifteenth sultan would be\ndivided between the two sons of their sovereign\u2014just as the\nmoon, their emblem, halfway through its course begins to divide into\ntwo horns\u2014one of whom would become an adherent of Christianity,\nwhile the other would be defeated by the king of Spain. Recently, the\nprophecy of Abbot Ubertino of Otranto had been miraculously recovered\nand predicted great political changes, the coronation of a new king in\nFrance and the beginning of the sixth age of the Church. The year\n1600, moreover, appeared to be a crucial moment, a \u201cgreat\nturning-point\u201d in time, in that it was composed of a hundred\ntimes seven and nine, both of which were fatal numbers according to\nPythagoras and Plato.\n\nIn the second of two written defences, Campanella sought to justify\nand legitimate his own initiative by placing it within a prophetic\ncontext, so that it would not be regarded as an act of rebellion,\nwhich would entail the death penalty. He later developed this work as\nthe Articuli prophetales, but during his trial he decided\nthat presenting it to his judges would be a futile effort. Instead, he\nresorted to a clever ploy in order to avoid capital punishment. The\ndeath penalty could not be inflicted on those deemed insane because,\nsince they were not in a position to repent, the judges would be\nresponsible for the eternal damnation of their souls. Clinging to this\njudicial cavil, Campanella pretended for many months to be out of his\nmind. His condition was, in the end, confirmed by means of a horrible\nform of torture, called the \u201cvigil\u201d because, in addition\nto the bodily suffering that was inflicted, victims were also\nsubjected to prolonged sleep deprivation. He would refer to this\nterrible moment in his life as proof of the freedom of the human will,\nthat cannot be bowed even by the most extreme physical pressure.\nAlthough disillusioned and embittered by the catastrophic result of\nhis noble Calabrian plan, Campanella questioned himself about the\nreasons for this failure, reflecting on the role of the prophet who,\nas bearer of an uncomfortable and unpleasant message for those in\npower, cannot avoid being persecuted and put to death. Having achieved\nthe supreme good of preserving his life, he wrote his most famous\nwork, The City of the Sun, in the form of a \u201cpoetical\ndialogue\u201d between a Genoese sailor who had accompanied Columbus\non his voyage to America and a Knight Hospitaller. It first appeared\nin Latin translation as the appendix to his Politica,\npublished in Frankfurt in 1623. His aim was to describe an ideal model\nof society that, in contrast to the violence, disorder and\nirrationality of the real world, was in harmony with nature,\nunderstood as an expression of God\u2019s intrinsic \u201cart\u201d and\nwisdom. He was, in fact, convinced that present-day society was a\nlabyrinth of injustice and unhappiness precisely because it had\ndeviated from this natural model. The more a city constituted a\n\u201cbody politic,\u201d the happier it would be, with its\nindividual parts integrated so as to form a unitary organism and its\nvarious limbs, diversified according to function, entirely coordinated\nto serve the communal well-being.\n\nProtected and defended by seven circles of walls, constructed of\npalaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens, the city is located\nin a place with an ideal climate, conducive to physical health, and on\nthe slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer.\nOne of the most significant aspects of this community is the\ndistribution of work. Once again Campanella engages in an explicit\npolemic with Aristotle, who had excluded artisans, peasants and those\ninvolved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and\nfrom the highest levels of virtue. In the City of the Sun no\noccupation is vile or base, and all are of equal dignity\u2014in\nfact, those workers who are required to expend greater effort, such as\nartisans and builders, receive more praise. Everyone must be\nacquainted with all lines of work, and then each person practices the\none for which he shows the greatest aptitude. They have no servants,\nand no service is regarded as unworthy. The only thing that they\nconsider to be despicable is idleness, and in this way they come to\nprivilege the dignity of work and to overturn an absurd conception of\nnobility, linked to inactivity and vice. Thanks to the equal division\nof labor, it is sufficient for each person to spend only four hours a\nday working; but it is essential that they all work, because the\nidleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort\nof the others. The citizens possess nothing; instead, everything is\nheld in common, from food to houses, from the acquisition of knowledge\nto the exercise of activities, from honors to amusements, from women\nto children. There are \u201cofficials\u201d in charge of the\ndistribution of each thing, who keep an eye out and make sure that\nthis happens justly, but no one can appropriate anything for himself.\nAccording to them, possession of a house or a family reinforces\n\u201cself-love\u201d, with all the dire consequences this\ngenerates. They live \u201clike philosophers in common\u201d because\nthey are aware of the negative impact, not only on the social but also\non the moral level, of an unequal distribution of goods.\n\nOne of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of The City of\nthe Sun, which immediately struck its readers, are the painted\nwalls of the city. Apart from enclosing and protecting the city, the\nwalls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages\nof an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge. The walls of the palaces\nare painted with images of the all the arts and sciences. Starting\nwith the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually\ndescending in large circles, following the order of the planets from\nMercury to Saturn, we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the\nstars, of mathematical figures, of every country on earth and of all\nthe marvels and secrets of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds,\nuntil we arrive at mankind: on the internal wall of the sixth circle\nthe mechanical arts and their inventors are represented. Campanella\nwas greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries, and in The\nCity of the Sun he provides many examples of curious inventions,\nsuch as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails, and\nstirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one\u2019s feet,\nleaving one\u2019s hands free. On the external wall legislators are\ndepicted; and it is here, in \u201ca place of great\nhonor\u201d\u2014but along with Moses, Osiris, Jove, Mercury and\nMuhammad\u2014that the Genoese sailor recognizes Christ and the\ntwelve apostles. Knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate\nplaces such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone\u2019s eyes.\nVisualizing in this manner promotes a quicker, easier and more\nefficient form of learning, in that it is connected to the art of\nmemory, which underlines the evocative and emotive power of images.\nFrom a tender age children run around in this theater of knowledge,\nappropriately guided and following correct itineraries, so that they\nlearn joyously, as if playing a game, without effort or pain.\n\nIn addition to the community of goods and the painted walls, another\ncharacteristic feature of the City of the Sun, one that is more\ndifficult and disconcerting and that Campanella himself describes as\n\u201chard and arduous\u201d, is the community of wives. This is the\nsolution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing\nthe teaching of the Pythagorean Ocellus Lucanus, Campanella says that\nthey are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses\nand dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a\nlarge responsibility of the part of the parents; and if it is\nexercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of\nsuffering. Moreover, there is a close connection between a person\u2019s\nnatural \u201ccomplexion\u201d or character, which is inborn and not\nafterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable\nterrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore\nrespect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual\nsentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. Affection\nbetween men and women, based on friendship and respect more than\nsexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from\nsexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing.\nSexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding\nthe physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a\npropitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a\nunion is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate\nrelationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of\ngeneration and to love for the collective community.\n\nThe religious beliefs of the citizenry, even though they include\nfundamental principles of Christianity such as the immortality of the\nsoul and divine providence, form a natural religion that establishes a\nsort of osmosis between the city and the stars. The temple is open and\nnot surrounded by walls. In one of his poems Campanella promises:\n\u201cI shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar\u201d\n(Poesie, 1998, p. 327). On the vault of the temple\u2019s dome the\nstars are depicted together with their influence on earthly affairs.\nThe altar, on which are placed a celestial and a terrestrial globe, is\nin the form of the sun. Prayers are directed toward the heavens. The\ntask of the twenty-four priests, who live in cells located in the\nhighest part of the temple, is to observe the stars and, using\nastronomical instruments, to take account of all their movements. It\nis their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and\nfor agricultural labors, acting in this way as intermediaries between\nGod and human beings.\n5. The Universal Monarchy\n\nThe City of the Sun is Campanella\u2019s best-known work today,\nbut it is not the only expression of his political thought, which was\nmultifaceted and which evolved over the course of his life, from his\nyouthful days until his final years of exile in Paris. An important\ntextual consideration is that while Campanella started writing his\nutopia in Italian soon after being sentenced to life imprisonment, at\nmore or less the same time he was working on a series of political aphorisms,\nalso in Italian. He eventually translated both texts into Latin,\nplacing the Civitas Solis as an appendix to the aphorisms,\nwhich now took the form of a treatise covering both theoretical and\npractical aspects of politics and government. The Politica\nand its appendix, together with four political quaestiones\nin which he also theorized about the utopian genre, constitute\nthe third part of his Philosophia realis (Frankfurt, 1623;\nParis, 1637). The shared trajectory of his general treatise on\npolitics and his utopia provides a clear indication of how different\naspects and expressions of his political thought were intertwined.\n\nWhile the Politica was Campanella\u2019s most analytic\ntreatise on the subject, he also articulated his political ideas in\nmany other writings. Apart from numerous works linked to particular\nmoments in the complex itinerary of his life and his thought, his\npolitical writings form part of a more general philosophical\nframework, which often makes it difficult to consider them on their\nown, since they are located in a zone that borders on theology, ethics\nand natural philosophy. It is not surprising, therefore, that it is\nprecisely in this area, so full of contradictions and ambiguities,\nthat the debate among his interpreters is most lively and most\nenflamed by polemics. It is difficult to reconcile the prophet of the\nCalabrian conspiracy, who, reading celestial and natural signs,\nproclaimed the advent of an epoch of profound renewal, with the\ndefender of the unconditional primacy of the papacy; or the thinker\nwho believed in the \u201cidea\u201d of a philosophical republic in\nwhich everything would be governed according to nature with the\nsupporter of a universal monarchy under the king of Spain; or,\nfinally, the harsh critic of Machiavelli, whom he accused of having\ncut the bonds between politics, ethics and religion, with the subtle\npolitician who in his writings frequently supported some of the most\nunscrupulous Machiavellian maxims. Campanella\u2019s reading of Machiavelli\nleft such an impression on his works that even his early readers did\nnot hesitate to define him as a \u201charsh critic and at the same\ntime a disguised master of Machiavelli\u2019s precepts\u201d (Hermann\nConring\u2019s introduction to the Latin translation of Machiavelli\u2019s\nPrince, in his Opera, 5 vols, Braunschweig 1730, II,\np. 979) and to affirm that he had relaunched on the scene, suitably\ncamouflaged and consequently in a more insidious manner, the same\nprinciples that Machiavelli had had the courage to express without\ndisguise (Conring, De civili prudentia, in his\nOpera, III, p. 41).\n\nThere is no doubt that Campanella\u2019s reflections on Machiavelli, and on\n\u201cpoliticians\u201d in general, constituted one of the most\nforceful aspects of his thought. His deliberations focused, above all,\non two closely connected points. On the one hand, he underlined the\nphilosophical limits of Machiavelli\u2019s theories\u2014limits that made\nhis political constructions inherently fragile. On the other hand, he\ndeveloped and inserted into a Catholic and Counter-Reformation context\nan element that was already present in Machiavelli, especially in his\nDiscourses on the First Decade of Livy: the view of religion\nas one of the most powerful bonds in the human community.\n\nBoth these elements are found in a central text of Campanella\u2019s\npolitical thought, the Monarchia di Spagna (Monarchy of\nSpain). Right from the outset, he expresses the doctrine of the\nthree causes that are at the origin of political\nassociations\u2014God, prudence and expediency\u2014in order to\nhighlight the inadequacy of a vision of history, characteristic of\npoliticians, that is limited solely to human causes. The first cause,\nthat rules and governs the others and that is always present, even if\nin hidden ways, in all historical events is, of course, God. This\nmeans that a skillful and shrewd politician must endeavor to integrate\nempirical causes into more general ones. To this end, it is\nindispensable to have recourse to the \u201chighest sciences\u201d\nof prophecy and of astrology, that enable one to insert particular\nevents into a universal background.\n\nAppealing to biblical texts, Campanella maintains that the Spanish\nsovereign can aspire to the monarchy of the world if he takes\ninspiration from the model of Cyrus, invested by God, as Isaiah (45.1)\nconfirms, with the mission of liberating the Church from infidels and\nof bringing together all peoples under a single faith. For the\nCatholic king the only practical way of achieving his own universal\nplans is through a firm accord with the Church and with the pope,\nfollowing the example of Constantine and Charlemagne. Campanella\nfurther stresses that religion is the most powerful bond of political\nunity. Machiavelli, too, had emphasized the strength of this bond,\nwhen analyzing the events of the Roman Republic, but then had\ncondemned the Christian religion as a cause of weakness, strife and\ndivisions. Campanella has no doubt that religion, whether true or\nfalse, is the primary and most powerful unifying force in the\npolitical body, in that it rules over souls and brings them together,\nand that all other ties between human beings depend on it.\n\nThe two other primary causes of political associations are prudence\nand expediency. Here another key element in Campanella\u2019s thought comes\ninto play: the return to nature. Political associations, like all\nother natural entities, are living organisms. The main task of\npolitical action will therefore be to promote the most effective union\namong its members. The virtue specific to this activity is prudence,\nwhich has the job of reinforcing natural bonds and coming up with\nunifying techniques designed to strengthen the ties of individuals\nwith the whole, of integrating unlike with like and of attenuating the\nmost violent conflicts, so that the result is the correct functioning\nand prosperity of the entire organism. When he speaks of prudence,\nCampanella insists on distinguishing it from Machiavellian cunning and\nfrom \u201creason of state,\u201d drawing on various clever and\nsubtle contrasts and distinctions. While prudence is an instrument of\norganic unity, cunning and reason of state are nothing but techniques\ndesigned to affirm individualistic egoism and, for this reason, are\ndoomed to failure, as is amply demonstrated by the tragic end of\nMachiavellian heroes, whose successes are revealed to be merely\napparent or ephemeral, or by the sad life of tyrants, constantly\nplagued by suspicions and fears. The wise politician is one who,\nhaving as his aim the solidarity and well-being of the whole\ncommunity, is in a position to promote three different types of bond.\nFirst of all, there is the bond of souls, achieved by the impetus\ngiven to the humanities and sciences and to religion. Secondly, there\nis the bond of bodies, in relation to which Campanella insists on the\nexpediency of increasing marriages by all available means, encouraging\nunions between individuals of different physical constitution and\ntemperament and between the Spanish and other nations, in order both\nto spread Spanishness to other nations and to temper the vices of the\nSpanish people, who often arouse hatred for their humility when\nserving and for their pride when commanding. The third bond is that of\ngoods of fortune; here it is a case of encouraging the economic\nprosperity of people by means of developing commerce and especially\nnavigation, the vital lymphatic system that makes it possible to unite\ndistant lands and to connect the separate limbs of the empire.\n\nThe stance adopted by Campanella in relation to universal monarchy is\ndirectly linked to the prophetic ideal of re-uniting humanity in a\n\u201csingle fold under one shepherd.\u201d The central text for\nthis topic is Monarchia del Messia (Monarchy of the\nMessiah). The original unity of king and priest, which derives\nfrom the divine unity, permits human beings, after the multiplicity of\nsects introduced by the devil and fomented by ambition and ignorance,\nto return to a single priestly law, under which the entire human race\ncan come together, transcending divisions and conflicts. According to\nCampanella, Adam and Hermes Trismegistus were simultaneously kings,\npriests and wise men. Uniting kingship and priesthood in the same\nperson is extremely advantageous and auspicious, for the people will\nmore willingly obey those whom they believe have their authority from\nGod; and their laws will be more respected and observed, whether in\npublic or in the inner sanctum of the human heart. The epoch in which\na king-priest will reign is described by Campanella as a golden age,\nin which there will be an end to the evils that afflict humanity: wars\nwill no longer have any reason to exist; famine and scarcity will\ncease because the barrenness of certain countries will be corrected\nand supplemented by the abundance of foodstuffs produced in other\ncountries; plagues will disappear because it will be possible to\ntransfer people to salubrious lands free from contagion; finally,\nthere will be a wondrous flourishing of all forms of knowledge thanks\nto exchanges of information and to communication, bringing great\nbenefits to humanity (Monarchia del Messia, pp. 62\u201363). The\ndivision and the separation of human beings are always the devil\u2019s\nwork; envious of the good that comes from unity, he induces people to\nforget that they are all children of the same God and of the same\nfather, Adam, and therefore siblings.\n6. Natural Religion: Atheism Conquered\n\nOne of Campanella\u2019s most important works is Atheismus\ntriumphatus (Atheism Conquered), written between 1606\nand 1607. He himself regarded it as a watershed in his thinking,\nsignaling his detachment from the more openly rationalist positions of\nhis youth and his move toward a more sincere adherence to Christian\nprinciples. In letters written from prison, he describes the work as a\n\u201cvolume against politicians and Machiavellians\u201d\n(Lettere, p. 26). Central to the work is his polemic against\nboth reason of state and Machiavelli\u2019s conception of religion as a\npolitical invention, a useful \u201cfiction\u201d devised by priests\nand princes to gain and maintain power. This polemic is coupled with\nthe need to undertake a far-reaching rational examination, passing in\nreview and evaluating all religious beliefs and philosophical\ndoctrines in order to demonstrate that religion, in contrast to what\npoliticians think, is a \u201cnatural virtue\u201d inborn in human\nbeings. A further motive of this research is to ascertain the\nrelationship between natural religion and Christianity, which leads to\nthe conclusion that there is no conflict between Christian law and\nnatural law but instead a profound and fundamental agreement, since\nChrist did not nullify and abolish natural law but rather added to it\nmoral precepts and rites that completed and perfected it.\n\nOn June 1, 1607 the treatise was dedicated to Kaspar Schoppe, a German\nscholar who had come to Naples in the spring of that year to make\ncontact with the imprisoned Campanella, who informs us that Schoppe\nsuggested the title by which the work is known\u2014he himself had\ncalled it Recognoscimento della vera religione universale\n(Identification of the True Universal Religion). Written in\nItalian, the treatise was translated into Latin in the following years\nby Campanella himself; it was printed in Rome in 1631, then in Paris\nin 1636. The original Italian version has recently come to light,\ndiscovered in an autograph manuscript held in the Vatican Library. In\nthe prefatory letter, addressed to Schoppe, Campanella weaves a moving\naccount of the dramatic events his life into a powerful contrast\nbetween darkness and light: on the one hand, there is a dark age\ndominated by reason of state; on the other, there is a determination\nto kindle a light in order to distinguish truth from error,\nphilosophers from sophists, princes from tyrants, religion from\nsuperstition. The first chapter acts as an introduction, setting out\nthe different ways of dealing with religion. From the outset, two\nfigures take center stage and come face to face as the heroes and\nvillains of the story: philosophers and politicians. The latter deny\nGod and his providence, maintaining that all religions are political\nin origin. Such doctrines, based on self-love, are extremely difficult\nto eradicate and constitute the plague of every age, since their\nsupporters refuse to engage in any dialogue, closed within the\narrogant certainty of possessing the truth. Diametrically opposed to\nthem are the philosophers, who believe that there is only one true and\ncertain truth, that is natural and common to all. Uncertain when it\ncomes to supernatural dogmas, they live in a virtuous manner in\nconformity with nature. Without doing harm to anyone, they endeavor to\naccomplish works that are honest and beneficial to the human race.\nSince they have no desire for honors or wealth, \u201cthey live\ncontent with little and enjoy contemplation, and they have more esteem\nfor themselves than for a king or a pope or a monarch.\u201d\n\nThe second chapter, one of the most famous and widely discussed in the\ntreatise, ushers us into the heart of the matter. It contains a dense\nseries of arguments against religion in general and Christianity in\nparticular. These objections are presented in such a crude light and\nin a succession so beleaguered by questions that they provoked\nperplexity and anxiety, in both Catholic and Protestant camps, even\nbefore the book was published. After the objections have been listed,\nthe replies to them are given in the central and concluding chapters.\nThe remaining chapters of the first part are devoted to demonstrating\nthat religion is natural and inherent in every aspect of nature, which\nis the expression of divine craftsmanship. From the axiom of the\nexistence of God as Reason and Wisdom diffused in every aspect of\nreality derive corollaries concerning the \u201cvestiges\u201d of\nthe Trinity that shine forth in every natural entity; the rationality\nof the Incarnation; the influence of providence on the world, which is\nthe theater and effigy of the divinity, not a dark labyrinth of\nsuffering; the non-existence of death and the relativity of evil,\nwhich is connected to non-being, itself necessary in order to\ndistinguish between things; the deep solidarity of human beings with\nnature but at the same time their inherent divinity and eminence that\nenables them to elevate themselves to a higher world. Next comes the\nvexed problem of the immortality of the soul, a certainty arrived at\nby paths that are different from those of the Aristotelian tradition\nand that insist on the distinctiveness of humans as the sole beings\nable to transcend their own natural limits and gain awareness of their\nrelationship to the infinite. In the ninth chapter Campanella\nreaffirms, against any skeptical position, that the existence of many\nfalse religions is not a sufficient reason for concluding that all\nreligions are fundamentally false, just as the lack of skill on the\npart of many doctors does not demonstrate the falsity of medicine. If\nit is true that there are differences between the various religions,\nwith their distinctive rites and supernatural beliefs, it is also true\nthat \u201chuman beings have a natural inclination toward justice and\ntoward living within a religion\u201d and that religion is part\n\u201cof the law of nature\u201d. A confirmation that religion is\nnatural is provided by the fact that it is the indispensable\nfoundation and connective tissue of every political organization,\nwhich would not be able to survive and would dissolve without\nreligion. The central chapters then attempt to prove that positive\nlaws are nothing but special cases of the same primary law of nature,\nsince if they are reasonable and just, they participate in the Divine\nWord, source of all rationality and all virtue. If there is only one\nnatural law and it depends on the unique eternal law, all humans, if\nthey live according to reason, are implicitly and explicitly\nChristians. Christianity is not one sect among many, but rather, as\nthe explication of the Word, coincides with natural religion,\ncompleted and perfected by supernatural beliefs, dogmas and ceremonies\nthat are not alien to rationality and to nature. Christianity, whether\non account of its simplicity and the universality of its moral message\nor because its ceremonial apparatus completes and perfects nature,\nturns out to be the religion that is most in conformity with nature\nand, consequently, opens up the possibility of a confluence of all\nbeliefs in one universal religion common to all peoples.\n\nOver the course of the almost thirty years that intervened between the\ncomposition of Atheismus triumphatus and the publication of\nthe definitive Paris edition of 1636, the treatise had to overcome\nmany obstacles, following a tortuous itinerary, due to the suspicions\nof the ecclesiastical authorities, who accused the work of Pelagianism\nand thus of excessively exalting the natural capacities of humans and\ndiminishing divine grace by restricting it to far too narrow confines.\nThe work was not published despite the initiative of Schoppe; nor was\nit among those that appeared in Frankfurt between 1617 and 1623 due to\nthe efforts of Tobias Adami. With the failure of these attempts,\nCampanella thought of publishing it in Italy; but the treatise still\nhad to face numerous difficulties and to be censored more than once\nbefore it came out in the Rome edition of 1631, which was soon\nafterwards impounded. After repeated entreaties to put the book back\ninto circulation, Campanella took the decision to reprint it in Paris;\nand Atheismus triumphatus was published, along with other\nwritings, at the beginning of 1636 in a volume dedicated to Louis\nXIII.\n7. The Years of Imprisonment in Naples and the Sojourns in Rome and Paris\n\nDuring the twenty-seven years he spent imprisoned in Neapolitan\ncastles (1599\u20131626), Campanella dedicated himself to the huge task of\nproviding a new foundation for the entire encyclopedia of knowledge,\nwriting, in addition to the works already mentioned, texts dealing\nwith medicine, astrology, practical religion (in Quod\nreminiscentur he addressed eloquent appeals to members of all the\nreligions of the world, aimed at persuading them to abandon irrational\nbeliefs and to come together in Christian rationality), the\nMetaphysica, later printed in Paris, and a theological\ntreatise in thirty books, whose publication, begun in the middle of\nthe nineteenth century, is still in progress. One of the most\ninteresting of his works is the Apologia per Galileo\n(Defense of Galileo). Written in 1616, when difficulties\nrelating to natural theology first began to amass around Copernican\nand Galilean doctrines, and printed in Frankfurt in 1622, the\nApologia represents an act of great courage and intellectual\nhonesty on Campanella\u2019s part, since he took up this delicate issue\nwhile he was still in prison and, furthermore, was not even defending\nhis own doctrines. His own image of the book of nature, conceived as a\nliving and organic entity, was far from Galileo\u2019s picture of a book\nwritten in mathematical characters. Rather than a defense of\nheliocentrism, about which Campanella harbored grave reservations on\naccount of its incompatibility with Telesian physics, the\nApologia is a defense of the intellectual and academic\nfreedom (libertas philosophandi) of Galileo and, more\ngenerally, of all Christian natural philosophers, whose first right\nand duty is to give preference to reading the book of nature over\nstudying the books written by human beings. With great clarity,\nCampanella identifies the nub of the problem as the unjustified\ndogmatic value conferred on Aristotelian philosophy which, like all\nhuman doctrines, does not possess absolute and definitive certainty.\nAll philosophies, in fact, must be modified, corrected or abandoned in\nlight of our reading of the book of nature. In this brief work he\ndraws on his immense theological knowledge to rethink in a profound\nand lucid manner the relationship between philosophy, science and\ntheology. In a virtuoso demonstration of his hermeneutic\nabilities\u2014on account of which the treatise in many places\ndifficult going for the reader, who is in danger of getting lost in\nthe thick tangle of citations\u2014Campanella attempts to show how\nthe longstanding union of theology and Aristotelian philosophy,\nregarded by theologians as necessary and unalterable, is in reality\nprecarious, dated and in need of revision. Such a revision would pose\nno risk to theology; on the contrary, theology will be harmed by an\nobstinate and blind adherence to a system of physics that is no longer\nin agreement with new data and that rejects new discoveries.\nAbandoning Aristotelian philosophy not only would not bring about the\ncollapse of theology, it would permit the recovery of a correct\nconception of science, one that must consist, as it did for Galileo,\nin a continual reading of the infinite book of nature, which is the\nexpression of the infinite truth and of Christian rationality. On this\nbasis Campanella invited Christianity to accept the rational and\nnatural values of science with confidence and without unjustified\nfears, if it intended to set itself up as the authentic expression of\nChrist as the Word of God.\n\nFreed from prison in Naples in 1626, Campanella moved to Rome, where\nhe lived until 1634. The most notorious episode of his Roman sojourn\nwas connected to Pope Urban VIII\u2019s desire to take advantage of his\nastrological expertise in order to counter the ever more insistent\npredictions of his imminent death, based on the inauspicious\ndisposition of the stars. Called to the papal palace, Campanella put\ninto effect the natural magic practices described in his short\ntreatise De siderali fato vitando (How To Avoid the Fate\nDictated by the Stars). Reprising themes borrowed from Marsilio\nFicino, who had taught how to attract the favor of the stars,\nCampanella proposed to teach how to avoid the evils threatened by the\nstars through taking suitable precautions. The most famous and\ncontroversial pages of this work, since they deal with practices used\non the pope, are those in which Campanella suggests remedies against\nthe possible harm caused by eclipses and comets. When an eclipse\nappears to threaten a specific person, he counsels using every\nprecaution to prevent the seeds carried in the polluted air from\nfinding a favorable terrain and producing their noxious effects. He\nthen explains how to demarcate a separate space that will be\nimpenetrable to malign influences. With the doors and windows sealed,\nthe air should be purified by sprinkling perfumes and scents and by\nburning aromatic woods such as laurel, myrtle, rosemary and cypress.\nIn the room, decorated with foliage and fabric of white silk, one\nshould set alight two lamps, five torches and other lights in order to\nrepresent the planets of the zodiac. It will also be useful to seek\nout the company of friends who are not subject to the negative effects\nof the eclipse, to play music connected with Jupiter and Venus, and to\nhave recourse to all those \u201centicements,\u201d connected with\nplants, stones, colors and odors, capable of attracting beneficent\ninfluences and countering malign ones. If the darkness of the eclipse\nseems to suspend and interrupt the life that flows from the heavens,\nit will be necessary to secure protection by constructing a sort of\nartificial sky. De fato was published in Lyons in 1629 as the\nseventh and final book of Campanella\u2019s Astrologia. This\nrisked compromising the pope himself by involving him in accusations\nof superstitious practices. Campanella was quick to write an\nApologeticus in which he attempted to demonstrate that the\npractices recommended in De fato were not superstitious but\nrather entirely natural. In a further effort to avert any scandal, in\nthe early months of 1632 Urban VIII hurriedly promulgated an extremely\nsevere bull, Inscrutabilis, directed against astrologers. The\npope also had Don Orazio Morandi, abbot of the monastery of Santa\nPrassede, in which astrological practices were entangled with shady\npolitical intrigues, imprisoned and put to death (see the introduction\nto Campanella, Opuscoli astrologici, pp. 41\u201342).\n\nFollowing new threats from the Spanish, in 1634 Campanella was forced\nto go into exile in Paris. There he devoted his energies to the\npublication of his works, bringing out a new edition of the\nPhilosophia realis in four parts, accompanied by\nquaestiones; reprints of De sensu rerum and of\nAtheismus triumphatus; Philosophia rationalis in\nfive parts (Dialectica, Grammatica, Rhetorica,\nPoetica and Historiographia); and, above all, the\nMetaphysica, which he described with legitimate pride in the\ndedicatory letter as the \u201cphilosophers\u2019 bible.\u201d This is a\nvast and complex work, in which the most important themes of his\nthought come together and in which he sets out the doctrine of the\n\u201cprimalities\u201d (primalitates), the constituent\nprinciples of the Supreme Being and of all other created beings. God,\nthe first infinite cause, has his essence in the principles of Power,\nWisdom and Love in an infinite manner. Every finite being is composed\nof these same primalities but in ways and proportions that are limited\nand differentiated. Nothingness does not exist either in God or\noutside of him; but he makes use of it to construct the finiteness and\nthe distinctiveness of entities. After the explanation of the doctrine\nof the primalities comes that of the three great influences:\nNecessity, Fate and Harmony, the vehicles by which the divine Idea, in\nall its infinite degrees, is conveyed to the world and to matter. In\nthe light of these doctrines, Campanella re-examines fundamental\nissues such as the relationship between necessity and contingency and\nbetween human freedom, fate and providence, as well as problems\nconcerning evil and sin.\n\nDuring his years in Paris Campanella\u2019s interest in politics and in\nprophecy, subjects close to his heart, resurfaced. In the two year\nperiod from 1635 to 1636 there was a remarkable blossoming of\npolitical writings, different in style and persuasive power, but\nsharing in common certain similar themes. Making a comparative\nanalysis of the two great European powers, Spain and France, he shows\nthat Spain is on the downward slope of an inexorable decline, while\nits adversary is in the ascendant phase of \u201cmounting\nsuccess\u201d and, as the new superpower, is exhorted to assume the\nrole of re-unifying the Christian flock and asserting itself as the\nchampion of liberty against the tyranny of Spanish-Habsburg rule.\nThere are two points in particular that most dramatically reveal the\nfatal decline of Spain: it has not known either how to spread\nSpanishness to other nations or to how to manage economy affairs\neffectively. While the ancient Romans were masters of gradually\naccumulating populations and making them participants in the empire,\nthe Spanish, on account of their immense pride, spurn any integration\nwhatever with other peoples. Because of their unwillingness to adopt\nthe shrewd political tactic of mixed marriages that Campanella had\nsuggested in the Monarchia di Spagna, an alarming\ndemographic contraction has occurred due to the loss of soldiers in war\nand the infertility of women, so that the Spanish population, formerly\nnumbering eight million, has now been reduced to half that figure.\nBecause of the scarcity of the populace, they have have\ninduced\u2014and this is a very serious consequence\u2014to destroy\nand depopulate the countries that they conquer in the New World.\nChosen by divine providence to evangelize the entire world, the\nSpanish have betrayed their mission, transforming themselves into\nexecutioners and instruments of divine wrath. An even greater\ncondemnation of Spanish politics is its disastrous economic policy. In\nthe Monarchia di Spagna Campanella had already said that the\ngold of the New World had ruined the Old Word, generating greed for\nriches and therefore weakening the ties and solidarity between\nhumans. In his later works he repeated the view that affluence had\nexacerbated social inequalities, together with the vices that derive\nfrom them.\n\nAt the request of Cardinal Richelieu, Campanella wrote and dedicated\nto him a short treatise on chiromancy, entitled\nChiroroscopia; and on the occasion of the long-awaited birth\nof the Dauphin, the future Sun King, Louis XIV, he composed a lengthy\nLatin Eclogue, in which he returned to the prophetic themes\nthat had always been dear to him. In these verses he once again\npredicted the advent of an epoch of unity and peace: impiety,\ndeception, lying and disputes would be abolished; work, distributed\namong everyone, would be turned from painful labor into a game; lambs\nwould no longer fear wolves; and sovereigns would rule for the benefit\nof their people. Aware of dire presages connected to the coming of a\nsolar eclipse, he sought to avert the impending dangers; but he died\nat dawn on May 21, 1639.\n",
