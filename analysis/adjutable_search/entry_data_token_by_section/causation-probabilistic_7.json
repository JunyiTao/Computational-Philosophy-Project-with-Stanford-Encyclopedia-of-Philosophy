Probability-raising Theories of Causation\n\nThe theories canvassed in this section all develop the basic idea that\ncauses raise the probability of their effects. These theories were\namong the leading theories of causation during the second half of the\n20th century. Today, they have largely been supplanted by\nthe causal modeling approaches discussed in\n Section 3.\n",
