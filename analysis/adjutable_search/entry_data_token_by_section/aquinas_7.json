    "main_text": "Cognitive Theory || Thought\n6.2 Thought\n\nAquinas thinks that a great deal of complex cognition occurs within\nthe internal senses of the brain, but that those material powers are\nincapable of abstract thought. To be more precise, he thinks that\nmaterial cognitive powers can represent things only as particulars,\nand that universal concepts can be formed only within the immaterial\nintellect. He writes,\n\nIf the intellective soul were composed of form and matter, then the\nforms of things would be received in it as individuals; then it would\ncognize only singular things, as happens in the sensory capacities,\nwhich receive the forms of things in a corporeal organ. (ST\n1a 75.5c)\n\n\nThe senses, both external and internal, can represent only this or\nthat particular cat. It takes the intellect to form the abstract\nconcept of cat. Conversely, Aquinas thinks that the human intellect is\nincapable of grasping particulars (ST 1a 86.1). This means\nthat when we engage in a routine task like apprehending that a thing\nis a cat we are simultaneously using both intellect and sense, using\nthe senses to apprehend the particular, and using the intellect to\nconceptualize what it is. In our more theoretical reflections, we rely\non the internal senses to frame images that aid us in the process of\nabstract reasoning.\n\nFollowing Aristotle\u2019s lead in De anima III.5, Aquinas\ndistinguishes between two distinct intellectual powers, the possible\nintellect and the agent intellect. The first starts out in\npotentiality to all intelligibles, a tabula rasa, \u201clike\na tablet on which nothing has been written\u201d (ST 1a\n79.2c), and gradually becomes actualized, taking in universal concepts\nthat are then stored there as dispositions. But because such concepts\nare not immediately available through sensory experience\u2014one\ncannot grasp what it is to be a cat just by looking at a\ncat\u2014there must also be an active intellectual power, \u201ca\npower on the side of intellect to actualize intelligible things by\nabstracting the species from material conditions\u201d (ST\n1a 79.3c). By Aquinas\u2019s time, generations of Aristotelians had\nalready argued over the correct understanding of these two powers,\nwith some treating the agent intellect as a single higher mind,\nseparate from human beings, and perhaps even to be identified with\nGod.\n Ibn Rushd\n (Averroes), the Spanish philosopher active a half century before\nAquinas, had even proposed treating the possible intellect as\na single higher power to which every human being has shared access.\nAquinas, in contrast, thinks that each human being has their own\nintellect, agent and possible. That we all share in a single agent\nintellect is, he thinks, wrong but not incredible\u2014it has\naffinities with the venerable Augustinian doctrine of\n divine illumination\u2014but\n Aquinas regards the Averroistic doctrine of a separate possible\nintellect as not just contrary to the faith but entirely preposterous,\nsince it would make it impossible to explain how we are each capable\nof individual acts of thought. As he describes the absurd implication\nin his treatise On the Unity of the Intellect against the\nAverroists, \u201cif I think about stone and you do likewise,\nthen it would be necessary that you and I have one and the same\nintellectual operation\u201d (4.101\u20133; see Ogden 2022).\n\nAquinas distinguishes between three principal stages of intellectual\noperation: first, the formation of concepts; second, the composition\nof judgments (propositions) built from concepts; third, inferential\nreasoning from one judgment to another. These last two stages were the\nsubject of intensive study within medieval logic, but Aquinas has\nrelatively little to say about logic, and is most interested in the\ninitial stage of concept formation. Here, the possible intellect\npassively receives concepts that the agent intellect has abstracted\nfrom sensory impressions (phantasms). The possible intellect starts\nout as a blank slate, which is to say that Aquinas rejects the theory\nof innate ideas, at least as far as the possible intellect is\nconcerned. Moreover, he is very clear that all our concepts arise from\nsensory experience: \u201cthe source of our cognition comes from the\nsenses\u201d (ST 1a 84.6sc). From this vantagepoint, he\nlooks more like an empiricist than a rationalist. The role of agent\nintellect, however, complicates the situation. Whereas the possible\nintellect starts out as unformed potentiality, the agent intellect has\nthe actuality to abstract universal concepts from sensory experience.\nIt is not easy to say how abstraction occurs; indeed, for the whole of\nthe Aristotelian tradition, the agent intellect has been something of\na black box whose operation is taken as a brute fact rather than\nanalyzed. Sometimes Aquinas suggests that the transformation of\nsingular content into universal content occurs via the conversion of\nmaterial phantasms into immaterial intelligible species, but the link\nbetween immateriality and universality is not entirely clear. (On\nabstraction see King 1994, Cory 2015).\n",
