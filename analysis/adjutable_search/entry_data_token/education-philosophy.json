Because it looks\nboth inward to the parent discipline and outward to educational\npractice and the social, legal, and institutional contexts in which it\ntakes place, philosophy of education concerns itself with both sides\nof the traditional theory/practice divide. Its subject matter includes\nboth basic philosophical issues (e.g., the nature of the knowledge\nworth teaching, the character of educational equality and justice,\netc.) and problems concerning specific educational policies and\npractices (e.g., the desirability of standardized curricula and\ntesting, the social, economic, legal and moral dimensions of specific\nfunding arrangements, the justification of curriculum decisions,\netc.). In all this the philosopher of education prizes conceptual\nclarity, argumentative rigor, the fair-minded consideration of the\ninterests of all involved in or affected by educational efforts and\narrangements, and informed and well-reasoned valuation of educational\naims and interventions.\n\nPhilosophy of education has a long and distinguished history in the\nWestern philosophical tradition, from Socrates\u2019 battles with the\nsophists to the present day. Many of the most distinguished figures in\nthat tradition incorporated educational concerns into their broader\nphilosophical agendas (Curren 2000, 2018; Rorty 1998). While that\nhistory is not the focus here, it is worth noting that the ideals of\nreasoned inquiry championed by Socrates and his descendants have long\ninformed the view that education should foster in all students, to the\nextent possible, the disposition to seek reasons and the ability to\nevaluate them cogently, and to be guided by their evaluations in\nmatters of belief, action and judgment. This view, that education\ncentrally involves the fostering of reason or rationality, has with\nvarying articulations and qualifications been embraced by most of\nthose historical figures; it continues to be defended by contemporary\nphilosophers of education as well (Scheffler 1973 [1989]; Siegel 1988,\n1997, 2007, 2017). As with any philosophical thesis it is\ncontroversial; some dimensions of the controversy are explored\nbelow.\n\nThis entry is a selective survey of important contemporary work in Anglophone philosophy of education; it does not treat in detail recent scholarship outside that context. \n", "toc": [{"#ProbDeliFiel": "1.

Problems in Delineating the Field\n\nThe inward/outward looking nature of the field of philosophy of\neducation alluded to above makes the task of delineating the field, of\ngiving an over-all picture of the intellectual landscape, somewhat\ncomplicated (for a detailed account of this topography, see Phillips\n1985, 2010). Suffice it to say that some philosophers, as well as\nfocusing inward on the abstract philosophical issues that concern\nthem, are drawn outwards to discuss or comment on issues that are more\ncommonly regarded as falling within the purview of professional\neducators, educational researchers, policy-makers and the like. (An\nexample is Michael Scriven, who in his early career was a prominent\nphilosopher of science; later he became a central figure in the\ndevelopment of the field of evaluation of educational and social\nprograms. See Scriven 1991a, 1991b.) At the same time, there are\nprofessionals in the educational or closely related spheres who are\ndrawn to discuss one or another of the philosophical issues that they\nencounter in the course of their work. (An example here is the\nbehaviorist psychologist B.F. Skinner, the central figure in the\ndevelopment of operant conditioning and programmed learning, who in\nworks such as Walden Two (1948) and Beyond Freedom and\nDignity (1972) grappled\u2014albeit controversially\u2014with\nmajor philosophical issues that were related to his work.) \n\nWhat makes the field even more amorphous is the existence of works on\neducational topics, written by well-regarded philosophers who have\nmade major contributions to their discipline; these educational\nreflections have little or no philosophical content, illustrating the\ntruth that philosophers do not always write philosophy. However,\ndespite this, works in this genre have often been treated as\ncontributions to philosophy of education. (Examples include John\nLocke\u2019s Some Thoughts Concerning Education [1693] and\nBertrand Russell\u2019s rollicking pieces written primarily to raise\nfunds to support a progressive school he ran with his \nwife. (See Park 1965.)\n\nFinally, as indicated earlier, the domain of education is vast, the\nissues it raises are almost overwhelmingly numerous and are of great\ncomplexity, and the social significance of the field is second to\nnone. These features make the phenomena and problems of education of\ngreat interest to a wide range of socially-concerned intellectuals,\nwho bring with them their own favored conceptual\nframeworks\u2014concepts, theories and ideologies, methods of\nanalysis and argumentation, metaphysical and other assumptions, and\nthe like. It is not surprising that scholars who work in this broad\ngenre also find a home in the field of philosophy of education.\n\nAs a result of these various factors, the significant intellectual and\nsocial trends of the past few centuries, together with the significant\ndevelopments in philosophy, all have had an impact on the content of\narguments and methods of argumentation in philosophy of\neducation\u2014Marxism, psycho-analysis, existentialism,\nphenomenology, positivism, post-modernism, pragmatism, neo-liberalism,\nthe several waves of feminism, analytic philosophy in both its\nordinary language and more formal guises, are merely the tip of the\niceberg.\n2. Analytic Philosophy of Education and Its Influence\n\nConceptual analysis, careful assessment of arguments, the rooting out\nof ambiguity, the drawing of clarifying distinctions\u2014all of\nwhich are at least part of the philosophical toolkit\u2014have been\nrespected activities within philosophy from the dawn of the field. No\ndoubt it somewhat over-simplifies the complex path of intellectual\nhistory to suggest that what happened in the twentieth\ncentury\u2014early on, in the home discipline itself, and with a lag\nof a decade or more in philosophy of education\u2014is that\nphilosophical analysis came to be viewed by some scholars as being the\nmajor philosophical activity (or set of activities), or even as being\nthe only viable or reputable activity. In any case, as they\ngained prominence and for a time hegemonic influence during the rise\nof analytic philosophy early in the twentieth century analytic\ntechniques came to dominate philosophy of education in the middle\nthird of that century (Curren, Robertson, & Hager 2003).\n\nThe pioneering work in the modern period entirely in an analytic mode\nwas the short monograph by C.D. Hardie, Truth and Fallacy in\nEducational Theory (1941; reissued in 1962). In his Introduction,\nHardie (who had studied with C.D. Broad and I.A. Richards) made it\nclear that he was putting all his eggs into the\nordinary-language-analysis basket:\n\n\nThe Cambridge analytical school, led by Moore, Broad and Wittgenstein,\nhas attempted so to analyse propositions that it will always be\napparent whether the disagreement between philosophers is one\nconcerning matters of fact, or is one concerning the use of words, or\nis, as is frequently the case, a purely emotive one. It is time, I\nthink, that a similar attitude became common in the field of\neducational theory. (Hardie 1962: xix)\n\n\nAbout a decade after the end of the Second World War the floodgates\nopened and a stream of work in the analytic mode appeared; the\nfollowing is merely a sample. D. J. O\u2019Connor published An\nIntroduction to Philosophy of Education (1957) in which, among\nother things, he argued that the word \u201ctheory\u201d as it is\nused in educational contexts is merely a courtesy title, for\neducational theories are nothing like what bear this title in the\nnatural sciences. Israel Scheffler, who became the paramount\nphilosopher of education in North America, produced a number of\nimportant works including The Language of Education (1960),\nwhich contained clarifying and influential analyses of definitions (he\ndistinguished reportive, stipulative, and programmatic types) and the\nlogic of slogans (often these are literally meaningless, and, he\nargued, should be seen as truncated arguments), Conditions of\nKnowledge (1965), still the best introduction to the\nepistemological side of philosophy of education, and Reason and\nTeaching (1973 [1989]), which in a wide-ranging and influential\nseries of essays makes the case for regarding the fostering of\nrationality/critical thinking as a fundamental educational ideal (cf.\nSiegel 2016). B. O. Smith and R. H. Ennis edited the volume\nLanguage and Concepts in Education (1961); and R.D.\nArchambault edited Philosophical Analysis and Education\n(1965), consisting of essays by a number of prominent British writers,\nmost notably R. S. Peters (whose status in Britain paralleled that of\nScheffler in the United States), Paul Hirst, and John Wilson. Topics\ncovered in the Archambault volume were typical of those that became\nthe \u201cbread and butter\u201d of analytic philosophy of education\n(APE) throughout the English-speaking world\u2014education as a\nprocess of initiation, liberal education, the nature of knowledge,\ntypes of teaching, and instruction versus indoctrination.\n\nAmong the most influential products of APE was the analysis developed\nby Hirst and Peters (1970) and Peters (1973) of the concept of\neducation itself. Using as a touchstone \u201cnormal English\nusage,\u201d it was concluded that a person who has been educated\n(rather than instructed or indoctrinated) has been (i) changed for the\nbetter; (ii) this change has involved the acquisition of knowledge and\nintellectual skills and the development of understanding; and (iii)\nthe person has come to care for, or be committed to, the domains of\nknowledge and skill into which he or she has been initiated. The\nmethod used by Hirst and Peters comes across clearly in their handling\nof the analogy with the concept of \u201creform\u201d, one they\nsometimes drew upon for expository purposes. A criminal who has been\nreformed has changed for the better, and has developed a commitment to\nthe new mode of life (if one or other of these conditions does not\nhold, a speaker of standard English would not say the criminal has\nbeen reformed). Clearly the analogy with reform breaks down with\nrespect to the knowledge and understanding conditions. Elsewhere\nPeters developed the fruitful notion of \u201ceducation as\ninitiation\u201d.\n\nThe concept of indoctrination was also of great interest to analytic\nphilosophers of education, for, it was argued, getting clear about\nprecisely what constitutes indoctrination also would serve to clarify\nthe border that demarcates it from acceptable educational processes.\nThus, whether or not an instructional episode was a case of\nindoctrination was determined by the content taught, the intention of\nthe instructor, the methods of instruction used, the outcomes of the\ninstruction, or by some combination of these. Adherents of the\ndifferent analyses used the same general type of argument to make\ntheir case, namely, appeal to normal and aberrant usage.\nUnfortunately, ordinary language analysis did not lead to unanimity of\nopinion about where this border was located, and rival analyses of the\nconcept were put forward (Snook 1972). The danger of restricting\nanalysis to ordinary language (\u201cnormal English usage\u201d) was\nrecognized early on by Scheffler, whose preferred view of analysis\nemphasized\n\n\nfirst, its greater sophistication as regards language, and the\ninterpenetration of language and inquiry, second, its attempt to\nfollow the modern example of the sciences in empirical spirit, in\nrigor, in attention to detail, in respect for alternatives, and in\nobjectivity of method, and third, its use of techniques of symbolic\nlogic brought to full development only in the last fifty years\u2026\nIt is\u2026this union of scientific spirit and logical method\napplied toward the clarification of basic ideas that characterizes\ncurrent analytic philosophy [and that ought to characterize analytic\nphilosophy of education]. (Scheffler 1973 [1989: 9\u201310])\n\n\nAfter a period of dominance, for a number of important reasons the\ninfluence of APE went into decline. First, there were growing\ncriticisms that the work of analytic philosophers of education had\nbecome focused upon minutiae and in the main was bereft of practical\nimport. (It is worth noting that a 1966 article in Time,\nreprinted in Lucas 1969, had put forward the same criticism of\nmainstream philosophy.) Second, in the early 1970\u2019s radical\nstudents in Britain accused Peters\u2019 brand of linguistic analysis\nof conservatism, and of tacitly giving support to \u201ctraditional\nvalues\u201d\u2014they raised the issue of whose English usage was\nbeing analyzed?\n\nThird, criticisms of language analysis in mainstream philosophy had\nbeen mounting for some time, and finally after a lag of many years\nwere reaching the attention of philosophers of education; there even\nhad been a surprising degree of interest on the part of the general\nreading public in the United Kingdom as early as 1959, when Gilbert\nRyle, editor of the journal Mind, refused to commission a\nreview of Ernest Gellner\u2019s Words and Things\n(1959)\u2014a detailed and quite acerbic critique of\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophy and its espousal of ordinary language\nanalysis. (Ryle argued that Gellner\u2019s book was too insulting, a\nview that drew Bertrand Russell into the fray on Gellner\u2019s\nside\u2014in the daily press, no less; Russell produced a list of\ninsulting remarks drawn from the work of great philosophers of the\npast. See Mehta 1963.)\n\nRichard Peters had been given warning that all was not well with APE\nat a conference in Canada in 1966; after delivering a paper on\n\u201cThe aims of education: A conceptual inquiry\u201d that was\nbased on ordinary language analysis, a philosopher in the audience\n(William Dray) asked Peters \u201cwhose concepts do we\nanalyze?\u201d Dray went on to suggest that different people, and\ndifferent groups within society, have different concepts of education.\nFive years before the radical students raised the same issue, Dray\npointed to the possibility that what Peters had presented under the\nguise of a \u201clogical analysis\u201d was nothing but the favored\nusage of a certain class of persons\u2014a class that Peters happened\nto identify with (see Peters 1973, where to the editor\u2019s credit\nthe interaction with Dray is reprinted). \n\nFourth, during the decade of the seventies when these various\ncritiques of analytic philosophy were in the process of eroding its\nluster, a spate of translations from the Continent stimulated some\nphilosophers of education in Britain and North America to set out in\nnew directions, and to adopt a new style of writing and argumentation.\nKey works by Gadamer, Foucault and Derrida appeared in English, and\nthese were followed in 1984 by Lyotard\u2019s The Postmodern\nCondition. The classic works of Heidegger and Husserl also found new admirers; and\nfeminist philosophers of education were finding their\nvoices\u2014Maxine Greene published a number of pieces in the 1970s\nand 1980s, including The Dialectic of Freedom (1988); the\ninfluential book by Nel Noddings, Caring: A Feminine Approach to\nEthics and Moral Education, appeared the same year as the work by\nLyotard, followed a year later by Jane Roland Martin\u2019s\nReclaiming a Conversation. In more recent years all these\ntrends have continued. APE was and is no longer the center of\ninterest, although, as indicated below, it still retains its\nvoice.\n3. Areas of Contemporary Activity\n\nAs was stressed at the outset, the field of education is huge and\ncontains within it a virtually inexhaustible number of issues that are\nof philosophical interest. To attempt comprehensive coverage of how\nphilosophers of education have been working within this thicket would\nbe a quixotic task for a large single volume and is out of the\nquestion for a solitary encyclopedia entry. Nevertheless, a valiant\nattempt to give an overview was made in A Companion to the\nPhilosophy of Education (Curren 2003), which contains more than\nsix-hundred pages divided into forty-five chapters each of which\nsurveys a subfield of work. The following random selection of chapter\ntopics gives a sense of the enormous scope of the field: Sex\neducation, special education, science education, aesthetic education,\ntheories of teaching and learning, religious education, knowledge,\ntruth and learning, cultivating reason, the measurement of learning,\nmulticultural education, education and the politics of identity,\neducation and standards of living, motivation and classroom\nmanagement, feminism, critical theory, postmodernism, romanticism, the\npurposes of universities, affirmative action in higher education, and\nprofessional education. The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of\nEducation (Siegel 2009) contains a similarly broad range of\narticles on (among other things) the epistemic and moral aims of\neducation, liberal education and its imminent demise, thinking and\nreasoning, fallibilism and fallibility, indoctrination, authenticity,\nthe development of rationality, Socratic teaching, educating the\nimagination, caring and empathy in moral education, the limits of\nmoral education, the cultivation of character, values education,\ncurriculum and the value of knowledge, education and democracy, art\nand education, science education and religious toleration,\nconstructivism and scientific methods, multicultural education,\nprejudice, authority and the interests of children, and on pragmatist,\nfeminist, and postmodernist approaches to philosophy of education.\n\nGiven this enormous range, there is no non-arbitrary way to select a\nsmall number of topics for further discussion, nor can the topics that\nare chosen be pursued in great depth. The choice of those below has\nbeen made with an eye to highlighting contemporary work that makes\nsolid contact with and contributes to important discussions in general\nphilosophy and/or the academic educational and educational research\ncommunities.\n3.1 The Content of the Curriculum and the Aims and Functions of Schooling\n\nThe issue of what should be taught to students at all levels of\neducation\u2014the issue of curriculum content\u2014obviously is a\nfundamental one, and it is an extraordinarily difficult one with which\nto grapple. In tackling it, care needs to be taken to distinguish\nbetween education and schooling\u2014for although education can occur\nin schools, so can mis-education, and many other things can take place\nthere that are educationally orthogonal (such as the provision of free\nor subsidized lunches and the development of social networks); and it\nalso must be recognized that education can occur in the home, in\nlibraries and museums, in churches and clubs, in solitary interaction\nwith the public media, and the like.\n\nIn developing a curriculum (whether in a specific subject area, or\nmore broadly as the whole range of offerings in an educational\ninstitution or system), a number of difficult decisions need to be\nmade. Issues such as the proper ordering or sequencing of topics in\nthe chosen subject, the time to be allocated to each topic, the lab\nwork or excursions or projects that are appropriate for particular\ntopics, can all be regarded as technical issues best resolved either\nby educationists who have a depth of experience with the target age\ngroup or by experts in the psychology of learning and the like. But\nthere are deeper issues, ones concerning the validity of the\njustifications that have been given for including/excluding particular\nsubjects or topics in the offerings of formal educational\ninstitutions. (Why should evolution or creation \u201cscience\u201d\nbe included, or excluded, as a topic within the standard high school\nsubject Biology? Is the justification that is given for teaching\nEconomics in some schools coherent and convincing? Do the\njustifications for including/excluding materials on birth control,\npatriotism, the Holocaust or wartime atrocities in the curriculum in\nsome school districts stand up to critical scrutiny?)\n\nThe different justifications for particular items of curriculum\ncontent that have been put forward by philosophers and others since\nPlato\u2019s pioneering efforts all draw, explicitly or implicitly,\nupon the positions that the respective theorists hold about at least\nthree sets of issues.\n\nFirst, what are the aims and/or functions of education (aims and\nfunctions are not necessarily the same)? Many aims have been proposed;\na short list includes the production of knowledge and knowledgeable\nstudents, the fostering of curiosity and inquisitiveness, the\nenhancement of understanding, the enlargement of the imagination, the\ncivilizing of students, the fostering of rationality and/or autonomy,\nand the development in students of care, concern and associated\ndispositions and attitudes (see Siegel 2007 for a longer list). The\njustifications offered for all such aims have been controversial, and\nalternative justifications of a single proposed aim can provoke\nphilosophical controversy. Consider the aim of autonomy. Aristotle\nasked, what constitutes the good life and/or human flourishing, such\nthat education should foster these (Curren 2013)? These two\nformulations are related, for it is arguable that our educational\ninstitutions should aim to equip individuals to pursue this good\nlife\u2014although this is not obvious, both because it is not clear\nthat there is one conception of the good or flourishing life that is\nthe good or flourishing life for everyone, and it is not clear that\nthis is a question that should be settled in advance rather than\ndetermined by students for themselves. Thus, for example, if our view\nof human flourishing includes the capacity to think and act\nautonomously, then the case can be made that educational\ninstitutions\u2014and their curricula\u2014should aim to prepare, or\nhelp to prepare, autonomous individuals. A rival justification of the\naim of autonomy, associated with Kant, champions the educational\nfostering of autonomy not on the basis of its contribution to human\nflourishing, but rather the obligation to treat students with respect\nas persons (Scheffler 1973 [1989]; Siegel 1988). Still others urge the\nfostering of autonomy on the basis of students\u2019 fundamental\ninterests, in ways that draw upon both Aristotelian and Kantian\nconceptual resources (Brighouse 2005, 2009). It is also possible to\nreject the fostering of autonomy as an educational aim (Hand\n2006).\n\nAssuming that the aim can be justified, how students should be helped\nto become autonomous or develop a conception of the good life and\npursue it is of course not immediately obvious, and much philosophical\nink has been spilled on the general question of how best to determine\ncurriculum content. One influential line of argument was developed by\nPaul Hirst, who argued that knowledge is essential for developing and\nthen pursuing a conception of the good life, and because logical\nanalysis shows, he argued, that there are seven basic forms of\nknowledge, the case can be made that the function of the curriculum is\nto introduce students to each of these forms (Hirst 1965; see Phillips\n1987: ch. 11). Another, suggested by Scheffler, is that curriculum\ncontent should be selected so as \u201cto help the learner attain\nmaximum self-sufficiency as economically as possible.\u201d The\nrelevant sorts of economy include those of resources, teacher effort,\nstudent effort, and the generalizability or transfer value of content,\nwhile the self-sufficiency in question includes \n\n\nself-awareness, imaginative weighing of alternative courses of action,\nunderstanding of other people\u2019s choices and ways of life,\ndecisiveness without rigidity, emancipation from stereotyped ways of\nthinking and perceiving\u2026empathy\u2026 intuition, criticism\nand independent judgment. (Scheffler 1973 [1989: 123\u20135]) \n\n\nBoth impose important constraints on the curricular content to be\ntaught.\n\nSecond, is it justifiable to treat the curriculum of an educational\ninstitution as a vehicle for furthering the socio-political interests\nand goals of a dominant group, or any particular group, including\none\u2019s own; and relatedly, is it justifiable to design the\ncurriculum so that it serves as an instrument of control or of social\nengineering? In the closing decades of the twentieth century there\nwere numerous discussions of curriculum theory, particularly from\nMarxist and postmodern perspectives, that offered the sobering\nanalysis that in many educational systems, including those in Western\ndemocracies, the curriculum did indeed reflect and serve the interests\nof powerful cultural elites. What to do about this situation (if it is\nindeed the situation of contemporary educational institutions) is far\nfrom clear and is the focus of much work at the interface of\nphilosophy of education and social/political philosophy, some of which\nis discussed in the next section. A closely related question is this:\nought educational institutions be designed to further pre-determined\nsocial ends, or rather to enable students to competently evaluate all\nsuch ends? Scheffler argued that we should opt for the latter: we must\n\n\n\nsurrender the idea of shaping or molding the mind of the pupil. The\nfunction of education\u2026is rather to liberate the mind,\nstrengthen its critical powers, [and] inform it with knowledge and the\ncapacity for independent inquiry. (Scheffler 1973 [1989: 139])\n\n\nThird, should educational programs at the elementary and secondary\nlevels be made up of a number of disparate offerings, so that\nindividuals with different interests and abilities and affinities for\nlearning can pursue curricula that are suitable? Or should every\nstudent pursue the same curriculum as far as each is able?\u2014a\ncurriculum, it should be noted, that in past cases nearly always was\nbased on the needs or interests of those students who were\nacademically inclined or were destined for elite social roles.\nMortimer Adler and others in the late twentieth century sometimes used\nthe aphorism \u201cthe best education for the best is the best\neducation for all.\u201d\n\nThe thinking here can be explicated in terms of the analogy of an\nout-of-control virulent disease, for which there is only one type of\nmedicine available; taking a large dose of this medicine is extremely\nbeneficial, and the hope is that taking only a little\u2014while less\neffective\u2014is better than taking none at all. Medically, this is\ndubious, while the educational version\u2014forcing students to work,\nuntil they exit the system, on topics that do not interest them and\nfor which they have no facility or motivation\u2014has even less\nmerit. (For a critique of Adler and his Paideia Proposal, see\nNoddings 2015.) It is interesting to compare the modern \u201cone\ncurriculum track for all\u201d position with Plato\u2019s system\noutlined in the Republic, according to which all\nstudents\u2014and importantly this included girls\u2014set out on\nthe same course of study. Over time, as they moved up the educational\nladder it would become obvious that some had reached the limit imposed\nupon them by nature, and they would be directed off into appropriate\nsocial roles in which they would find fulfillment, for their abilities\nwould match the demands of these roles. Those who continued on with\ntheir education would eventually become members of the ruling class of\nGuardians.\n3.2 Social, Political and Moral Philosophy\n\nThe publication of John Rawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice in\n1971 was the most notable event in the history of political philosophy\nover the last century. The book spurred a period of ferment in\npolitical philosophy that included, among other things, new research\non educationally fundamental themes. The principles of justice in\neducational distribution have perhaps been the dominant theme in this\nliterature, and Rawls\u2019s influence on its development has been\npervasive.\n\nRawls\u2019s theory of justice made so-called \u201cfair equality of\nopportunity\u201d one of its constitutive principles. Fair equality\nof opportunity entailed that the distribution of education would not\nput the children of those who currently occupied coveted social\npositions at any competitive advantage over other, equally talented\nand motivated children seeking the qualifications for those positions\n(Rawls 1971: 72\u201375). Its purpose was to prevent socio-economic\ndifferences from hardening into social castes that were perpetuated\nacross generations. One obvious criticism of fair equality of\nopportunity is that it does not prohibit an educational distribution\nthat lavished resources on the most talented children while offering\nminimal opportunities to others. So long as untalented students from\nwealthy families were assigned opportunities no better than those\navailable to their untalented peers among the poor, no breach of the\nprinciple would occur. Even the most moderate egalitarians might find\nsuch a distributive regime to be intuitively repugnant.\n\nRepugnance might be mitigated somewhat by the ways in which the\noverall structure of Rawls\u2019s conception of justice protects the\ninterests of those who fare badly in educational competition. All\ncitizens must enjoy the same basic liberties, and equal liberty always\nhas moral priority over equal opportunity: the former can never be\ncompromised to advance the latter. Further, inequality in the\ndistribution of income and wealth are permitted only to the degree\nthat it serves the interests of the least advantaged group in society.\nBut even with these qualifications, fair equality of opportunity is\narguably less than really fair to anyone. The fact that their\neducation should secure ends other than access to the most selective\nsocial positions\u2014ends such as artistic appreciation, the kind of\nself-knowledge that humanistic study can furnish, or civic\nvirtue\u2014is deemed irrelevant according to Rawls\u2019s\nprinciple. But surely it is relevant, given that a principle of\neducational justice must be responsive to the full range of\neducationally important goods.\n\nSuppose we revise our account of the goods included in educational\ndistribution so that aesthetic appreciation, say, and the necessary\nunderstanding and virtue for conscientious citizenship count for just\nas much as job-related skills. An interesting implication of doing so\nis that the rationale for requiring equality under any just\ndistribution becomes decreasingly clear. That is because job-related\nskills are positional whereas the other educational goods are not\n(Hollis 1982). If you and I both aspire to a career in business\nmanagement for which we are equally qualified, any increase in your\njob-related skills is a corresponding disadvantage to me unless I can\ncatch up. Positional goods have a competitive structure by definition,\nthough the ends of civic or aesthetic education do not fit that\nstructure. If you and I aspire to be good citizens and are equal in\ncivic understanding and virtue, an advance in your civic education is\nno disadvantage to me. On the contrary, it is easier to be a good\ncitizen the better other citizens learn to be. At the very least, so\nfar as non-positional goods figure in our conception of what counts as\na good education, the moral stakes of inequality are thereby\nlowered.\n\nIn fact, an emerging alternative to fair equality of opportunity is a\nprinciple that stipulates some benchmark of adequacy in achievement or\nopportunity as the relevant standard of distribution. But it is\nmisleading to represent this as a contrast between egalitarian and\nsufficientarian conceptions. Philosophically serious interpretations\nof adequacy derive from the ideal of equal citizenship (Satz 2007;\nAnderson 2007). Then again, fair equality of opportunity in\nRawls\u2019s theory is derived from a more fundamental ideal of\nequality among citizens. This was arguably true in A Theory of\nJustice but it is certainly true in his later work (Dworkin 1977:\n150\u2013183; Rawls 1993). So, both Rawls\u2019s principle and the\nemerging alternative share an egalitarian foundation. The debate\nbetween adherents of equal opportunity and those misnamed as\nsufficientarians is certainly not over (e.g., Brighouse & Swift\n2009; Jacobs 2010; Warnick 2015). Further progress will likely hinge\non explicating the most compelling conception of the egalitarian\nfoundation from which distributive principles are to be inferred.\nAnother Rawls-inspired alternative is that a\n\u201cprioritarian\u201d distribution of achievement or opportunity\nmight turn out to be the best principle we can come up\nwith\u2014i.e., one that favors the interests of the least advantaged\nstudents (Schouten 2012). \n\nThe publication of Rawls\u2019s Political Liberalism in 1993\nsignaled a decisive turning point in his thinking about justice. In\nhis earlier book, the theory of justice had been presented as if it\nwere universally valid. But Rawls had come to think that any theory of\njustice presented as such was open to reasonable rejection. A more\ncircumspect approach to justification would seek grounds for justice\nas fairness in an overlapping consensus between the many reasonable\nvalues and doctrines that thrive in a democratic political culture.\nRawls argued that such a culture is informed by a shared ideal of free\nand equal citizenship that provided a new, distinctively democratic\nframework for justifying a conception of justice. The shift to\npolitical liberalism involved little revision on Rawls\u2019s part to\nthe content of the principles he favored. But the salience it gave to\nquestions about citizenship in the fabric of liberal political theory\nhad important educational implications. How was the ideal of free and\nequal citizenship to be instantiated in education in a way that\naccommodated the range of reasonable values and doctrines encompassed\nin an overlapping consensus? Political Liberalism has\ninspired a range of answers to that question (cf. Callan 1997; Clayton\n2006; Bull 2008).\n\nOther philosophers besides Rawls in the 1990s took up a cluster of\nquestions about civic education, and not always from a liberal\nperspective. Alasdair Macintyre\u2019s After Virtue (1984)\nstrongly influenced the development of communitarian political theory\nwhich, as its very name might suggest, argued that the cultivation of\ncommunity could preempt many of the problems with conflicting\nindividual rights at the core of liberalism. As a full-standing\nalternative to liberalism, communitarianism might have little to\nrecommend it. But it was a spur for liberal philosophers to think\nabout how communities could be built and sustained to support the more\nfamiliar projects of liberal politics (e.g., Strike 2010).\nFurthermore, its arguments often converged with those advanced by\nfeminist exponents of the ethic of care (Noddings 1984; Gilligan\n1982). Noddings\u2019 work is particularly notable because she\ninferred a cogent and radical agenda for the reform of schools from\nher conception of care (Noddings 1992). \n\nOne persistent controversy in citizenship theory has been about\nwhether patriotism is correctly deemed a virtue, given our obligations\nto those who are not our fellow citizens in an increasingly\ninterdependent world and the sordid history of xenophobia with which\nmodern nation states are associated. The controversy is partly about\nwhat we should teach in our schools and is commonly discussed by\nphilosophers in that context (Galston 1991; Ben-Porath 2006; Callan\n2006; Miller 2007; Curren & Dorn 2018). The controversy is related\nto a deeper and more pervasive question about how morally or\nintellectually taxing the best conception of our citizenship should\nbe. The more taxing it is, the more constraining its derivative\nconception of civic education will be. Contemporary political\nphilosophers offer divergent arguments about these matters. For\nexample, Gutmann and Thompson claim that citizens of diverse\ndemocracies need to \u201cunderstand the diverse ways of life of\ntheir fellow citizens\u201d (Gutmann & Thompson 1996: 66). The\nneed arises from the obligation of reciprocity which they (like Rawls)\nbelieve to be integral to citizenship. Because I must seek to\ncooperate with others politically on terms that make sense from\ntheir moral perspective as well as my own, I must be ready to\nenter that perspective imaginatively so as to grasp its distinctive\ncontent. Many such perspectives prosper in liberal democracies, and so\nthe task of reciprocal understanding is necessarily onerous. Still,\nour actions qua deliberative citizen must be grounded in such\nreciprocity if political cooperation on terms acceptable to us as\n(diversely) morally motivated citizens is to be possible at all. This\nis tantamount to an imperative to think autonomously inside the role\nof citizen because I cannot close-mindedly resist critical\nconsideration of moral views alien to my own without flouting my\nresponsibilities as a deliberative citizen.\n\nCivic education does not exhaust the domain of moral education, even\nthough the more robust conceptions of equal citizenship have\nfar-reaching implications for just relations in civil society and the\nfamily. The study of moral education has traditionally taken its\nbearings from normative ethics rather than political philosophy, and\nthis is largely true of work undertaken in recent decades. The major\ndevelopment here has been the revival of virtue ethics as an\nalternative to the deontological and consequentialist theories that\ndominated discussion for much of the twentieth century.\n\nThe defining idea of virtue ethics is that our criterion of moral\nright and wrong must derive from a conception of how the ideally\nvirtuous agent would distinguish between the two. Virtue ethics is\nthus an alternative to both consequentialism and deontology which\nlocate the relevant criterion in producing good consequences or\nmeeting the requirements of moral duty respectively. The debate about\nthe comparative merits of these theories is not resolved, but from an\neducational perspective that may be less important than it has\nsometimes seemed to antagonists in the debate. To be sure,\nadjudicating between rival theories in normative ethics might shed\nlight on how best to construe the process of moral education, and\nphilosophical reflection on the process might help us to adjudicate\nbetween the theories. There has been extensive work on habituation and\nvirtue, largely inspired by Aristotle (Burnyeat 1980; Peters 1981).\nBut whether this does anything to establish the superiority of virtue\nethics over its competitors is far from obvious. Other aspects of\nmoral education\u2014in particular, the paired processes of\nrole-modelling and identification\u2014deserve much more scrutiny\nthan they have received (Audi 2017; Kristj\u00e1nsson 2015, 2017).\n3.3 Social Epistemology, Virtue Epistemology, and the Epistemology of Education\n\nRelated to the issues concerning the aims and functions of education\nand schooling rehearsed above are those involving the specifically\nepistemic aims of education and attendant issues treated by\nsocial and virtue epistemologists. (The papers collected in Kotzee\n2013 and Baehr 2016 highlight the current and growing interactions\namong social epistemologists, virtue epistemologists, and philosophers\nof education.)\n\nThere is, first, a lively debate concerning putative epistemic aims.\nAlvin Goldman argues that truth (or knowledge understood in\nthe \u201cweak\u201d sense of true belief) is the fundamental\nepistemic aim of education (Goldman 1999). Others, including the\nmajority of historically significant philosophers of education, hold\nthat critical thinking or rationality and rational\nbelief (or knowledge in the \u201cstrong\u201d sense that\nincludes justification) is the basic epistemic educational aim (Bailin\n& Siegel 2003; Scheffler 1965, 1973 [1989]; Siegel 1988, 1997,\n2005, 2017). Catherine Z. Elgin (1999a,b) and Duncan Pritchard (2013,\n2016; Carter & Pritchard 2017) have independently urged that\nunderstanding is the basic aim. Pritchard\u2019s view\ncombines understanding with intellectual virtue; Jason Baehr\n(2011) systematically defends the fostering of the intellectual\nvirtues as the fundamental epistemic aim of education. This cluster of\nviews continues to engender ongoing discussion and debate. (Its\ncomplex literature is collected in Carter and Kotzee 2015, summarized\nin Siegel 2018, and helpfully analyzed in Watson 2016.)\n\nA further controversy concerns the places of testimony and\ntrust in the classroom: In what circumstances if any ought\nstudents to trust their teachers\u2019 pronouncements, and why? Here\nthe epistemology of education is informed by social epistemology,\nspecifically the epistemology of testimony; the familiar\nreductionism/anti-reductionism controversy there is applicable to\nstudents and teachers. Anti-reductionists, who regard testimony as a\nbasic source of justification, may with equanimity approve of\nstudents\u2019 taking their teachers\u2019 word at face value and\nbelieving what they say; reductionists may balk. Does teacher\ntestimony itself constitute good reason for student belief? \n\nThe correct answer here seems clearly enough to be \u201cit\ndepends\u201d. For very young children who have yet to acquire or\ndevelop the ability to subject teacher declarations to critical\nscrutiny, there seems to be little alternative to accepting what their\nteachers tell them. For older and more cognitively sophisticated\nstudents there seem to be more options: they can assess them for\nplausibility, compare them with other opinions, assess the\nteachers\u2019 proffered reasons, subject them to independent\nevaluation, etc. Regarding \u201cthe teacher says that\np\u201d as itself a good reason to believe it appears\nmoreover to contravene the widely shared conviction that an important\neducational aim is helping students to become able to evaluate\ncandidate beliefs for themselves and believe accordingly. That said,\nall sides agree that sometimes believers, including students, have\ngood reasons simply to trust what others tell them. There is thus more\nwork to do here by both social epistemologists and philosophers of\neducation (for further discussion see Goldberg 2013; Siegel 2005,\n2018).\n\nA further cluster of questions, of long-standing interest to\nphilosophers of education, concerns indoctrination: How if at\nall does it differ from legitimate teaching? Is it inevitable, and if\nso is it not always necessarily bad? First, what is it? As we saw\nearlier, extant analyses focus on the aims or\nintentions of the indoctrinator, the methods\nemployed, or the content transmitted. If the indoctrination\nis successful, all have the result that students/victims either\ndon\u2019t, won\u2019t, or can\u2019t subject the indoctrinated\nmaterial to proper epistemic evaluation. In this way it produces both\nbelief that is evidentially unsupported or contravened and uncritical\ndispositions to believe. It might seem obvious that indoctrination, so\nunderstood, is educationally undesirable. But it equally seems that\nvery young children, at least, have no alternative but to believe\nsans evidence; they have yet to acquire the dispositions to\nseek and evaluate evidence, or the abilities to recognize evidence or\nevaluate it. Thus we seem driven to the views that indoctrination is\nboth unavoidable and yet bad and to be avoided. It is not obvious how\nthis conundrum is best handled. One option is to distinguish between\nacceptable and unacceptable indoctrination. Another is to distinguish\nbetween indoctrination (which is always bad) and non-indoctrinating\nbelief inculcation, the latter being such that students are taught\nsome things without reasons (the alphabet, the numbers, how to read\nand count, etc.), but in such a way that critical evaluation of all\nsuch material (and everything else) is prized and fostered (Siegel\n1988: ch. 5). In the end the distinctions required by the two options\nmight be extensionally equivalent (Siegel 2018).\n\nEducation, it is generally granted, fosters belief: in the\ntypical propositional case, Smith teaches Jones that p, and\nif all goes well Jones learns it and comes to believe it. Education\nalso has the task of fostering open-mindedness and an\nappreciation of our fallibility: All the theorists mentioned\nthus far, especially those in the critical thinking and intellectual\nvirtue camps, urge their importance. But these two might seem at odds.\nIf Jones (fully) believes that p, can she also be open-minded\nabout it? Can she believe, for example, that earthquakes are caused by\nthe movements of tectonic plates, while also believing that perhaps\nthey aren\u2019t? This cluster of italicized notions requires careful\nhandling; it is helpfully discussed by Jonathan Adler (2002, 2003),\nwho recommends regarding the latter two as meta-attitudes concerning\none\u2019s first-order beliefs rather than lessened degrees of belief\nor commitments to those beliefs.\n\nOther traditional epistemological worries that impinge upon the\nepistemology of education concern (a) absolutism,\npluralism and relativism with respect to knowledge,\ntruth and justification as these relate to what is taught, (b) the\ncharacter and status of group epistemologies and the\nprospects for understanding such epistemic goods\n\u201cuniversalistically\u201d in the face of\n\u201cparticularist\u201d challenges, (c) the relation between\n\u201cknowledge-how\u201d and \u201cknowledge-that\u201d and their\nrespective places in the curriculum, (d) concerns raised by\nmulticulturalism and the inclusion/exclusion of marginalized\nperspectives in curriculum content and the classroom, and (e) further\nissues concerning teaching and learning. (There is more here than can\nbe briefly summarized; for more references and systematic treatment\ncf. Bailin & Siegel 2003; Carter & Kotzee 2015; Cleverley\n& Phillips 1986; Robertson 2009; Siegel 2004, 2017; and Watson\n2016.)\n3.4 Philosophical Disputes Concerning Empirical Education Research\n\nThe educational research enterprise has been criticized for a century\nor more by politicians, policymakers, administrators, curriculum\ndevelopers, teachers, philosophers of education, and by researchers\nthemselves\u2014but the criticisms have been contradictory. Charges\nof being \u201ctoo ivory tower and theory-oriented\u201d are found\nalongside \u201ctoo focused on practice and too atheoretical\u201d;\nbut in light of the views of John Dewey and William James that the\nfunction of theory is to guide intelligent practice and\nproblem-solving, it is becoming more fashionable to hold that the\n\u201ctheory v. practice\u201d dichotomy is a false one. (For an\nilluminating account of the historical development of educational\nresearch and its tribulations, see Lagemann 2000.)\n\nA similar trend can be discerned with respect to the long warfare\nbetween two rival groups of research methods\u2014on one hand\nquantitative/statistical approaches to research, and on the other hand\nthe qualitative/ethnographic family. (The choice of labels here is not\nentirely risk-free, for they have been contested; furthermore the\nfirst approach is quite often associated with\n\u201cexperimental\u201d studies, and the latter with \u201ccase\nstudies\u201d, but this is an over-simplification.) For several\ndecades these two rival methodological camps were treated by\nresearchers and a few philosophers of education as being rival\nparadigms (Kuhn\u2019s ideas, albeit in a very loose form, have been\ninfluential in the field of educational research), and the dispute\nbetween them was commonly referred to as \u201cthe paradigm\nwars\u201d. In essence the issue at stake was epistemological:\nmembers of the quantitative/experimental camp believed that only their\nmethods could lead to well-warranted knowledge claims, especially\nabout the causal factors at play in educational phenomena, and on the\nwhole they regarded qualitative methods as lacking in rigor; on the\nother hand the adherents of qualitative/ethnographic approaches held\nthat the other camp was too \u201cpositivistic\u201d and was\noperating with an inadequate view of causation in human\naffairs\u2014one that ignored the role of motives and reasons,\npossession of relevant background knowledge, awareness of cultural\nnorms, and the like. Few if any commentators in the \u201cparadigm\nwars\u201d suggested that there was anything prohibiting the use of\nboth approaches in the one research program\u2014provided that if\nboth were used, they were used only sequentially or in parallel, for\nthey were underwritten by different epistemologies and hence could not\nbe blended together. But recently the trend has been towards\nrapprochement, towards the view that the two methodological families\nare, in fact, compatible and are not at all like paradigms in the\nKuhnian sense(s) of the term; the melding of the two approaches is\noften called \u201cmixed methods research\u201d, and it is growing\nin popularity. (For more detailed discussion of these\n\u201cwars\u201d see Howe 2003 and Phillips 2009.)\n\nThe most lively contemporary debates about education research,\nhowever, were set in motion around the turn of the millennium when the\nUS Federal Government moved in the direction of funding only\nrigorously scientific educational research\u2014the kind that could\nestablish causal factors which could then guide the development of\npractically effective policies. (It was held that such a causal\nknowledge base was available for medical decision-making.) The\ndefinition of \u201crigorously scientific\u201d, however, was\ndecided by politicians and not by the research community, and it was\ngiven in terms of the use of a specific research method\u2014the net\neffect being that the only research projects to receive Federal\nfunding were those that carried out randomized controlled experiments\nor field trials (RFTs). It has become common over the last decade to\nrefer to the RFT as the \u201cgold standard\u201d methodology.\n\nThe National Research Council (NRC)\u2014an arm of the US National\nAcademies of Science\u2014issued a report, influenced by\npostpostivistic philosophy of science (NRC 2002), that argued that\nthis criterion was far too narrow. Numerous essays have appeared\nsubsequently that point out how the \u201cgold standard\u201d\naccount of scientific rigor distorts the history of science, how the\ncomplex nature of the relation between evidence and policy-making has\nbeen distorted and made to appear overly simple (for instance the role\nof value-judgments in linking empirical findings to policy directives\nis often overlooked), and qualitative researchers have insisted upon\nthe scientific nature of their work. Nevertheless, and possibly\nbecause it tried to be balanced and supported the use of RFTs in some\nresearch contexts, the NRC report has been the subject of symposia in\nfour journals, where it has been supported by a few and attacked from\na variety of philosophical fronts: Its authors were positivists, they\nerroneously believed that educational inquiry could be value neutral\nand that it could ignore the ways in which the exercise of power\nconstrains the research process, they misunderstood the nature of\neducational phenomena, and so on. This cluster of issues continues to\nbe debated by educational researchers and by philosophers of education\nand of science, and often involves basic topics in philosophy of\nscience: the constitution of warranting evidence, the nature of\ntheories and of confirmation and explanation, etc. Nancy\nCartwright\u2019s important recent work on causation, evidence, and\nevidence-based policy adds layers of both philosophical sophistication\nand real world practical analysis to the central issues just discussed\n(Cartwright & Hardie 2012, Cartwright 2013; cf. Kvernbekk 2015 for\nan overview of the controversies regarding evidence in the education\nand philosophy of education literatures). \n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAs stressed earlier, it is impossible to do justice to the whole field of\nphilosophy of education in a single encyclopedia entry. Different\ncountries around the world have their own intellectual traditions and\ntheir own ways of institutionalizing philosophy of education in the\nacademic universe, and no discussion of any of this appears in the\npresent essay. But even in the Anglo-American world there is such a\ndiversity of approaches that any author attempting to produce a\nsynoptic account will quickly run into the borders of his or her\ncompetence. Clearly this has happened in the present case. \n\nFortunately, in the last thirty years or so resources have become\navailable that significantly alleviate these problems. There has been\na flood of encyclopedia entries, both on the field as a whole and also\non many specific topics not well-covered in the present essay (see, as\na sample, Burbules 1994; Chambliss 1996b; Curren 1998, 2018; Phillips\n1985, 2010; Siegel 2007; Smeyers 1994), two\n\u201cEncyclopedias\u201d (Chambliss 1996a; Phillips 2014), a\n\u201cGuide\u201d (Blake, Smeyers, Smith, & Standish 2003), a\n\u201cCompanion\u201d (Curren 2003), two \u201cHandbooks\u201d\n(Siegel 2009; Bailey, Barrow, Carr, & McCarthy 2010), a\ncomprehensive anthology (Curren 2007), a dictionary of key concepts in\nthe field (Winch & Gingell 1999), and a good textbook or two (Carr\n2003; Noddings 2015). In addition there are numerous volumes both of\nreprinted selections and of specially commissioned essays on specific\ntopics, some of which were given short shrift here (for another\nsampling see A. Rorty 1998, Stone 1994), and several international\njournals, including Theory and Research in Education,\nJournal of Philosophy of Education, Educational\nTheory, Studies in Philosophy and Education, and\nEducational Philosophy and Theory. Thus there is more than\nenough material available to keep the interested reader busy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, Jonathan E., 2002, <em>Belief\u2019s Own Ethics</em>,\nCambridge, MA: MIT Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2003, \u201cKnowledge, Truth and\nLearning\u201d, in Curren 2003: 285\u2013304.\ndoi:10.1002/9780470996454.ch21", "Anderson, Elizabeth, 2007, \u201cFair Opportunity in Education: A\nDemocratic Equality Perspective\u201d, <em>Ethics</em>, 117(4):\n595\u2013622. doi:10.1086/518806", "Archambault, Reginald D.
