    "main_text": "\n\nLogical empiricism is a philosophic movement rather than a set of\ndoctrines, and it flourished in the 1920s and 30s in several centers\nin Europe and in the 40s and 50s in the United States. It had several\ndifferent leaders whose views changed considerably over time.\nMoreover, these thinkers differed from one another, often sharply.\nBecause logical empiricism is here construed as a movement rather than\nas doctrine, there is probably no important position that all logical\nempiricists shared\u2014including, surprisingly enough, empiricism.\nAnd while most participants in the movement were empiricists of one\nform or another, they disagreed on what the best form of empiricism\nwas and on the cognitive status of empiricism. What held the group\ntogether was a common concern for scientific methodology and the\nimportant role that science could play in reshaping society. Within\nthat scientific methodology the logical empiricists wanted to find a\nnatural and important role for logic and mathematics and to find an\nunderstanding of philosophy according to which it was part of the\nscientific enterprise.\n\nThe following discussion of logical empiricism is organized under five\nheadings:\n",
