    "main_text": "The Interim Account: 1903 || Interpretants\n3.3 Interpretants\n\nAs with the sign-vehicle and the object, Peirce thought we could\nclassify signs in terms of their relation with their interpretant.\nAgain, he identifies three categories according to which feature of\nthe relationship with its object a sign uses in generating an\ninterpretant. Further, as with the classification of the sign in terms\nof the sign-vehicle and the object, Peirce identifies qualities,\nexistential facts, or conventional features as the basis for\nclassifying the sign in terms of its interpretant.\n\nIf the sign determines an interpretant by focusing our understanding\nof the sign upon the qualitative features it employs in signifying its\nobject, then the sign is classified as a rheme. Examples are\nnot straightforward, but one way of understanding rhemes, is to think\nof them as unsaturated predicates like, \u201c\u2014 is a\ndog\u201d, \u201c\u2014 is happy\u201d, \u201c\u2014 loves\n\u2014\u201d or \u201c\u2014 gives \u2014 to \u2014\u201d, and so\non. Whenever we understand a sign in terms of qualities it suggests\nits object may have, we generate an interpretant that qualifies its\nsign as a rheme. If, on the other hand, a sign determines an\ninterpretant by focusing our understanding of the sign upon the\nexistential features it employs in signifying an object, then the sign\nis a dicent. We can think of dicents is as saturated\npredicates, or propositions, like \u201cFido is a dog\u201d,\n\u201cLarry is happy\u201d, \u201cFido loves Larry\u201d,\n\u201cLarry gives food to Fido\u201d, and so on. And finally, if a\nsign determines an interpretant by focusing our understanding on some\nconventional or law-like features employed in signifying the object,\nthen the sign is a delome, or as Peirce most frequently, but\nconfusingly, calls them, arguments. Further, just as we can\nthink of a rheme as an unsaturated predicate, and a dicent as a\nproposition, we can think of the delome as an argument or rule of\ninference. Our ability to understand a sign in terms of its place in\nsome pattern of reasoning and system of signs enables us to derive\ninformation from it (by deductive reasoning) or make conjectures about\nit (by inductive and abductive reasoning). So, whenever we come to\nunderstand a sign as focusing our attention upon some conventional\nfeature of its relationship with object, that is, enabling us to\nunderstand the sign as part of a rule governed system of knowledge and\nsigns etc., we have an interpretant that qualifies a sign as a delome\n(or argument).\n",
