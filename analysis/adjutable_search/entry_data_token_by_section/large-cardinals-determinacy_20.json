    "main_text": "The Case for Definable Determinacy || Summary\n4.7  Summary\n\nEach of the above arguments has two parts. In the first part, one\nargues that there is a \u201cgood\u201d theory (one having certain\nfruitful consequences). In many cases this theory explicitly includes\n(or just is) ADL(\u211d). In the second part, one\nshows that all such theories include\nADL(\u211d). \n\n We want to stress this second part\u2014the recovery\ntheorems. Without the recovery theorems one could always wonder\nwhether there are incompatible axioms with the same fruitful\nconsequences. In contrast to the case of physics, where one could\nnever hope to show that the data logically implies the theory, in the\ncase of the search for new axioms this is in fact possible. It is the\nrecovery theorems that seal the case. \n\n Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of axioms of definable\ndeterminacy is the last. For the results show that there are deep\nconnections between approaches to new axioms from conceptually\ndistinct domains and that, remarkably, ADL(\u211d)\nis part of the picture provided by each. In short,\nADL(\u211d) lies in the overlapping consensus of\nall approaches that involve climbing the hierarchy of interpretability\nalong a natural path. \n\nFurther Reading: For more on the topics of this section\nsee Koellner (2006, 2009b), Maddy (1988a,b), Martin (1998), Steel\n(2000), and Woodin (2001a,b, 2005a,b). \n",
