    "main_text": "The importance of happiness || Doubts about the value of happiness\n4.1 Doubts about the value of happiness\n\nWere you to survey public attitudes about the value of happiness, at\nleast in liberal Western democracies, you would likely find\nconsiderable support for the proposition that happiness is all that\nreally matters for human well-being. Many philosophers over the ages\nhave likewise endorsed such a view, typically assuming a hedonistic\naccount of happiness. (A few, like Almeder 2000, have identified\nwell-being with happiness understood as life satisfaction.)\n\nMost philosophers, however, have rejected hedonistic and other mental\nstate accounts of well-being, and with them the idea that happiness\ncould suffice for\n well-being.[24]\n (See the entry on\n well-being.)\n Objections to mental state theories of well-being tend to cluster\naround two sets of concerns. First, it is widely believed that the\nnon-mental conditions of our lives matter\nfor well-being: whether our families really love us, whether our\nputative achievements are genuine, whether the things we care about\nactually obtain. The most influential objection of this sort is Robert\nNozick\u2019s experience machine case, wherein we are asked to\nimagine a virtual reality device that can perfectly simulate any\nreality for its user, who will think the experience is genuine (Nozick\n1974). Would you plug in to such a machine for life? Most people would\nnot, and the case is widely taken to vitiate mental state theories of\nwell-being. Beyond having positive mental states, it seems to matter\nboth that our lives go well and that our state of mind is\nappropriately related to how things \n are.[25]\n\nA second set of objections concerns various ways in which a happy\nperson might nonetheless seem intuitively to be leading an\nimpoverished or stunted life. The most influential of these\nworries involves adaptation, where individuals facing\noppressive circumstances scale back their expectations and find\ncontentment in \u201csmall mercies,\u201d as Sen put\n it.[26]\n Even a slave might come to internalize the values of his oppressors\nand be happy, and this strikes most as an unenviable life indeed.\nRelated worries involve people with diminished capacities\n(blindness, Down Syndrome), or choosing to lead narrow and\ncramped or simpleminded lives (e.g., counting blades of grass).\nWorries about impoverished lives are a prime motivator of Aristotelian\ntheories of well-being, which emphasize the full and proper exercise\nof our human capacities.\n\nIn the face of these and other objections most commentators have\nconcluded that neither happiness nor any other mental state can\nsuffice for well-being. Philosophical interest in happiness has\nconsequently flagged, since its theoretical importance becomes unclear\nif it does not play a starring role in our account of the good.\n\nEven as happiness might fail to suffice for well-being, well-being\nitself may be only one component of a good life, and not the\nmost important one at that. Here \u2018good life\u2019 means a life\nthat is good all things considered, taking account of all the values\nthat matter in life, whether they benefit the individual or not. Kant,\nfor example, considered both morality and well-being to be important\nbut distinct elements of a good life. Yet morality should be our first\npriority, never to be sacrificed for personal happiness.\n\nIn fact there is a broad consensus, or near-consensus, among ethical\ntheorists on a doctrine we might call the priority of virtue:\nbroadly and crudely speaking, the demands of virtue or morality trump\nother values in\n life.[27]\n We ought above all to act and live well, or at least not badly or\nwrongly. This view need not take the strong form of insisting that we\nmust always act as virtuously as possible, or that moral reasons\nalways take precedence. But it does mean, at least, that when being\nhappy requires acting badly, one\u2019s happiness must be sacrificed.\nIf it would be wrong to leave your family, in which you are unhappy,\nthen you must remain unhappy, or find more acceptable ways to seek\nhappiness.\n\nThe mainstream views in all three of the major approaches to ethical\ntheory\u2014consequentialism, deontology, and virtue\nethics\u2014agree on some form of the priority of virtue. Where these\nviews chiefly differ is not on the importance of being good, but on\nwhether being good necessarily benefits us. Virtue ethicists\ntend to answer in the affirmative, the other two schools in the\nnegative. Building virtue into well-being, as Aristotelians do, may\nseem to yield a more demanding ethics, and in some ways it does. Yet\nmany deontologists and consequentialists\u2014notably\nKant\u2014advocate sterner, more starkly moralistic visions of the\ngood life than Aristotle would ever have dreamt of (e.g., Singer\n1972).\n\nHappiness, in short, is believed by most philosophers to be\ninsufficient for well-being, and still less important for the good\nlife. These points may seem to vitiate any substantial role for\nhappiness in ethical thought. However, well-being itself is still\nregarded as a central concept in ethical thought, denoting one of the\nchief elements of a good life even if not the sole element. And there\nare reasons for thinking happiness important, both practically and\ntheoretically, despite the worries noted above.\n",
