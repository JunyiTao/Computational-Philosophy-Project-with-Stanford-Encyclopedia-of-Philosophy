    "main_text": "Event-Causal Theories\n2. Event-Causal Theories\n\nCompatibilist accounts of free action are typically event-causal\nviews, invoking event-causal accounts of action. The simplest\nevent-causal incompatibilist theory takes the requirements of a good\ncompatibilist account and adds that certain agent-involving events\nthat cause the action must nondeterministically cause it. When these\nconditions are satisfied, it is held, the agent exercises in\nperforming her action a certain variety of active control (which is\nsaid to consist in the action\u2019s being caused, in an appropriate\nway, by those agent-involving events), the action is performed for a\nreason, and there remains, until she acts, a chance of the\nagent\u2019s not performing that action. (It might be required that\nthere remains, until the action is performed, a chance that the agent\nwill perform a different action instead right then.) It is thus said\nto be open to the agent to do otherwise, even given that (it is\nclaimed) its being so open is incompatible with the truth of\ndeterminism.\n\nOne purported problem for such a view is that the indeterminism that\nit requires is destructive, that it would diminish the control with\nwhich an agent acts to the extent that responsibility would be\nundermined. The most common version of this worry is the problem of\nluck, which holds that indeterminism reduces control by introducing\nluck. A second common objection is the problem of enhanced control,\nwhich holds that the required indeterminism is superfluous, that it\nadds nothing of value that could not exist in a deterministic world.\nWe shall examine these objections below. First, let us consider a type\nof event-causal incompatibilist account that is advocated by writers\nwho accept a qualified version of the first of these objections.\n",
