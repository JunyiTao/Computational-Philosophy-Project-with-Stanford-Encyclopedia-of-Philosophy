    "main_text": "Classifying Mystical Experiences || Extrovertive and Introvertive\n2.1 Extrovertive and Introvertive\n\nWalter Stace (1960) fixed the distinction between\n\u201cextrovertive\u201d and \u201cintrovertive\u201d mystical experiences in\nphilosophy of mysticism (also see Otto 1932, 57\u201372). When\nan experience includes sense-perception, it is an \u201cextrovertive\u201d\nexperience. Mystical extrovertive experiences include consciousness of\nthe unity of nature overlaid onto one\u2019s sense-perception of the\nworld, as well as non-unitive extrovertive experiences such as\n\u201ccosmic consciousness.\u201d When not extrovertive, an experience is\n\u201cintrovertive.\u201d Examples include the experience of\n\u201cnothingness\u201d \u2014 an awareness lacking all\ndifferentiated content \u2014 and an awareness of God\nlacking sense-experiences.\n\nExtrovertive mystical experiences are not merely stunted\nintrovertive ones but complete experiences in their own right\n(see Jones 2016; contra Stace 1960). Paul Marshall (2005) has\ndeveloped a detailed phenomenology of these experiences.\n",
