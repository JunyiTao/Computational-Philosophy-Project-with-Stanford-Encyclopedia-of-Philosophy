    "main_text": "The Old and the New Riddle of Induction and their Solution || Goodman\u2019s Solution\n5.4 Goodman\u2019s Solution\nGoodman\u2019s solution to the new riddle of induction resembles Hume\u2019s\nsolution in an important way. Instead of providing a theory that would\nultimately justify our choice of predicates for induction, he develops\na theory that provides an account of how we in fact choose predicates\nfor induction and projection. Goodman observes that predicates like\n\u201cgreen\u201d are favored over predicates like\n\u201cgrue\u201d, because the former are much\nbetter entrenched, i.e., in the past we projected many more\nhypotheses featuring \u201cgreen\u201d or predicates co-extensional\nwith \u201cgreen\u201d than hypothesis featuring the predicate\n\u201cgrue\u201d. If two hypotheses are the same with respect to\ntheir empirical track-record, then the hypothesis that uses the better\nentrenched predicates overrides the alternatives. On the basis of\nthese considerations, Goodman defines projectibility (and\ncognates) for hypotheses (FFF, 108):\n\nA hypothesis is projectible iff it is supported,\nunviolated, and unexhausted, and all hypotheses conflicting with it\nare overridden.\nA hypothesis is unprojectible iff it is unsupported, exhausted,\nviolated, or overridden.\nA hypothesis is nonprojectible iff it and a conflicting hypothesis\nare supported, unviolated, unexhausted, and not overridden.\n\nThe last definition takes care of situations when we are confronted\nwith two hypotheses that are in conflict and neither has a better\nentrenched predicate. Entrenchment can even be further refined to\naccount for cases in which a predicate inherits the entrenchment from\nanother of which it is derivative. (The critical literature on Goodman\u2019s\nNew Riddle is too extensive to do it justice here; see Stalker 1994  \nand Elgin 1997c for selections of important essays on the topic. \nStalker 1994 also contains an annotated bibliography, comprising \nover 300 entries. The discussion of course continued after the 1990s and the\nliterature is still growing.)\n\n\nGoodman\u2019s solution makes projectibility essentially a matter of\nwhat language we use and have used to describe and predict\nthe behaviour of our world. However, this language-, or better\nversion-relativism is just another aspect of Goodman\u2019s\nirrealism.\n",
