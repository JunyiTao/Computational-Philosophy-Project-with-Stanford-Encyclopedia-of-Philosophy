Immunology\u2019s Social Dimensions\n\nAnti-foreign imagery in immunology provides an excellent case study of\nbidirectional links between science and society (Tauber 1994, 2016;\nHowes 1999). The wide acceptance of the self-nonself discrimination\nmodel derived from the paradigmatic host-pathogen struggle that\nexemplified the nineteenth century conceptualization of the body as\nisolated from the environment. As developed by Claude Bernard, this\ninsular construct provided biology a theoretical foundation for\norganismal biology that complemented Malthusian economics, liberal\npolitical philosophy, and Comtian sociology to instantiate the\nautonomous body as a political, social, economic and medical entity\n(Foucault 1963 [1973]; Agamben 1998). Notwithstanding that\n\u201cindependence\u201d is a political term, Bernard\u2019s notion\nof autonomy fails to fairly represent the dialectical relationships of\nthe organism and its environment (Levins and Lewontin 1985), nor the\nevolutionary peculiarities of individuality itself (Buss 1987).\n\nThe depiction of the immune self as disconnecting the organism from\nits surroundings harmonized with a particular Western cultural\nexperience of seeing \u201courselves as entities, separate from the\nrest of the world\u2014as containers with insides and outsides\u201d\n(Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 58; Fleck 1935 [1979: 174\u2013175]).\nHowever, this extrapolation of a particular Western notion of\nsubjectivity may well be regarded a social construct (Mead 1962)\ninasmuch as cross-cultural analysis reveals how the ancient Chinese\nsensed self more like a fluid interface than as an enclosed entity\n(Geaney 2011). And contemporary anthropological studies re-confirm how\nnotions of selfhood vary between cultures (e.g., Roland 1988). From\nthis perspective, social connotations and subjective experiences go\nhand in hand with creating meaningful images of immunity and\nbiological identity. Finding its fertile soil in the fifties, the idea\nof the demarcated organism squarely fit the valorization of\nindividualism that had diffused into Western arts, politics and\nscience during this period (Barbour 1995). An insular understanding of\n\u201cthe self\u201d at the core of these atomistic\ncharacterizations lies at the foundation of immune theory and\npractice, where contemporary psychological and philosophical\nconstructions of identity based on autonomous individuality prevail\n(Tauber 1994).\n\nHowever, culture critics have seized on immunology\u2019s notions of\nautonomy as exemplifying modern notions of identity, where boundaries\nare contested, and the body becomes the localized site of battle\nbetween self and other (Sontag 1990; Haraway 1989; E. Martin 1994).\nThese commentators cite the recognized permeability of living\ncreatures, their symbiotic exchanges, and tolerance of myriad\nassimilated foreign materials to challenge the origin and cultural\nresonance of the atomistic framework. David Napier has characterized\nour \u201cage of immunology\u201d as an individualism marked by a\npreoccupation with the self and by an absence of transforming efforts\nto incorporate the foreign (Napier 2003). Active rejection enunciated\nwith warfare metaphors so prevalent in immunology\u2019s\nlexicon\u2014\u201cattack\u201d, \u201cdefense\u201d,\n\u201cinvaders\u201d\u2014dramatically illustrate this formulation,\nboth in terms of the self/other dichotomy, as well as the privileged\nregard of individuality over community. On this view, the\n\u201cimmune self\u201d appears as a metaphor to model Western\nculture, by invoking \u201cimmunization\u201d as an explanatory\nmodel for understanding the core dynamics of post-industrial societies\n(Esposito 2011; Sloterdijk 2011). The metaphor\u2019s wide\napplication\u2014from religion and metaphysics to housing and\ncities\u2014invokes the dialectics of borders and exchange,\nindividuality and communes, where the balance of intrusion and defense\nis invoked to characterize the \u201cbubble\u201d in which humans\nlive. Note, these interpretations closely resonate with the dynamics\nof immunity regarded ecologically, as discussed above. \n\nThese contrasting applications of social descriptions to immunology\nreveal the ease by which the science may be employed for culture\ncriticism. But the exchange need not end with such contributions.\nHaving been implemented in the discourse of science, the imagery\nborrowed from the culture-at-large becomes transformed and then\nreturns to the social domain, impacting on portrayals of persons and\ntheir relationship with others (E. Martin 1994). On this view, the\nscience-culture exchange broadens the implications of understanding\nthe development of immune theory. For example, the political resonance\nof the self/nonself framework was evident in the context of a debate\non tissue incompatibility, whose depiction as innate and unchangeable\nharmonized with Burnet and Medawar\u2019s elitist sympathies and\nopposition towards social Lamarckism (Lafferty 1995). The vision of\npersonhood that stood behind the self/nonself discrimination concept,\ncan be further traced back to Burnet\u2019s self-confessed\n\u201charmless terror of strangers\u201d and his\nDarwinist vision of human relationships as defined by primordial\nselfishness and incessant drives towards domination and power (Burnet\n1971: 12). Along with ongoing cultural and political transformations, our\nunderstanding of immune identity has also changed in the transition\nfrom a modernist vision of delineated selfhood towards a more complex view\nthat dispenses with the self altogether. Thus, the imagery that is\nused to represent the activity of the immune system has deep roots in\nthe broader culture that reflect dominant values and tensions defining the dialectics of the individual and her society. In sum, while immunology provides metaphors for characterizing human societies, the science in turn, draws from its supporting culture to model its\nbiology. Here we see an explicit demonstration of the\nbi-directionality of social and scientific discourses, and to draw the\nline separating the laboratory from its supporting culture again\nproves problematic (Gieryn 1995).\n",
