    "main_text": "The Lockean Legacy || Locke\u2019s Human/Person Distinction\n2.1 Locke\u2019s Human/Person Distinction\n\nFrom an animalist perspective, the most significant aspect of\nLocke\u2019s famous discussion is the sharp distinction he draws\nbetween the human animal (\u201cman\u201d) and the person. Unlike a\nmass of matter\u2014which consists merely in \u201cthe Cohesion of\nParticles \u2026 any how united\u201d (II.xxvii.4)\u2014a living\norganism (e.g., oak tree, horse, human animal) is a structurally\ncomplex material object whose functional organization is conducive to\ncontinued life. A person, by contrast, is a \n\u201cthinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and \ncan\nconsider it self as it self, the same thinking thing in different\ntimes and places; which it does by that consciousness, which is\ninseparable from thinking\u201d (II.xxvii.9).\n\nBy classifying \u201cman\u201d with other organisms and then drawing\na distinction between organisms and persons, Locke recognizes that he\nis prying apart the traditional notion of \u201cman\u201d as\nrational, on the one hand, and animal, on the other. Against this\ntraditional understanding, he introduces a thought experiment\ninvolving a rational parrot (II.xxvii.8). Our unwillingness to call\nthis parrot a \u201cman\u201d simply because it is an animal\npossessed of language and reason illustrates that not all rational\nanimals are men. Nor are all men rational animals: \u201cwhoever\nshould see a Creature of his own Shape and Make, though it had no more\nreason all its Life, than a Cat or a Parrot, would\ncall him still a Man\u201d (ibid.).  The human/person\ndistinction gains traction once it is coupled with one of\nthe Essay\u2019s key insights, viz. that sortal concepts\n(e.g., human animal, person) are often (though not\nalways) associated with different identity criteria.\n\u201cIdentity\u201d\u2014as he puts it in the title of the section\nin which this insight is first registered\u2014is \u201csuited to\nthe Idea\u201d: \u201csuch as is the Idea\nbelonging to [a] Name, such must be the Identity\u201d\n(II.xxvii.7). Locke is keenly aware of the significance of this\nprinciple; \u201cif it had been a little more carefully attended\nto\u201d, he admonishes, it \u201cwould possibly have prevented a\ngreat deal of that Confusion, which often occurs about this Matter\n\u2026 especially concerning\nPersonal Identity\u201d (ibid.).  And indeed, it is this\ninsight about the association of sortal concepts and identity criteria\nthat encourages the thought in Locke that human animals and persons\nare governed by different criteria of identity. Whereas a human animal\npersists just in case \u201cthe same continued Life [is] communicated\nto different Particles of Matter, as they happen successively to be\nunited to that organiz\u2019d living Body\u201d (II.xxvii.8), when\none \u201cconsider[s] what Person stands for\u201d, Locke\ncontends, one finds that its persistence consists in \u201cthe\nsameness of a rational Being\u201d. He explains: \u201cas far as\nthis consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or\nThought, so far reaches the Identity of that\nPerson\u201d (II.xxvii.9).\n\nThe impetus behind Locke\u2019s human/person distinction was the\nongoing debate amongst seventeenth- and eighteenth-century theologians\nand philosophers concerning the metaphysics of resurrection. Their\nchallenge was to account for the Biblical prediction that the dead\nwould be resurrected on judgment day. But what is it exactly that gets\nresurrected? The physical particles associated with a living organism\nare in a state of constant flux. The set of particles associated with\nan organism changes from one moment to the next and may turnover\ncompletely (perhaps several times) during the course of an\norganism\u2019s life. Moreover, whether due to decomposition and/or\nbecause they are consumed by other organisms, the particles associated\nwith an organism at its death will be widely dispersed. These facts\nalone make it unlikely, if not impossible, that the resurrection of\neach individual will involve the reconstitution of that\nindividual\u2019s former \u201cbody\u201d. The human/person\ndistinction supplies Locke with the resources to resolve this problem\nbecause, on his view, something is a person not because of\nthe material or immaterial substance in which it is grounded\u2014a\nquestion on which Locke remains steadfastly agnostic, though he is\ninclined to think the underlying substance is immaterial\n(II.xxvii.25)\u2014but in virtue of the psychological capacities it\nexercises, viz. self-consciousness and rationality. And a person\npersists \u201cas far as\u201d the exercise of those capacities\n\u201creaches\u201d (II.xxvii.9): \u201cFor the same consciousness\nbeing preserv\u2019d, whether in the same or different Substances,\nthe personal Identity is preserv\u2019d\u201d (II.xxvii.13).  Thus\nthe way is clear for Locke to assert that one and the same person may\nbe resurrected even if that person comes to inhabit an altogether\ndifferent body than any with which she was previously associated\n(II.xxvii.15).\n\nIt is in the context of his solution to this problem that Locke\nintroduces the famous thought experiment involving the prince and the\ncobbler\u2014not as a puzzle in need of explanation, but as a case\nwhose apparent plausibility vindicates the human/person distinction\n(and thereby, his solution to the problem of the resurrection). If\n\n\u201cthe soul of the prince, carrying with it the consciousness of\nthe Prince\u2019s past Life, [were to] enter and inform the Body of a\nCobler as soon as deserted by his own Soul\u201d, Locke enjoins his\nreader, \u201cevery one sees, he would be the same Person\nwith the Prince, accountable only for the Prince\u2019s Actions: But\nwho would say it was the same Man?\u201d (II.xxvii.15, emphasis\nadded).  This thought experiment is often taken to support a\npsychological criterion of personal identity. The precise form of such\na criterion has been the subject of much dispute, both in\nLocke\u2019s time and subsequently. Locke himself is sometimes said\n(probably incorrectly) to have advocated a memory criterion, according\nto which a person,\nx, existing at one time, \\(t_1\\), and a person, y,\nexisting at a later time, \\(t_2\\), y is identical with x\nif and only if y remembers experiences had by x. Whether\nor not this was Locke\u2019s view, generally speaking, psychological\ncriteria of personal identity assert that a psychological relation of\nsome sort (i.e. a relation involving memory, characteristics and\ndispositions, beliefs, desires, rationality, etc.) is necessary and/or\nsufficient for each of us to persist through time.\n\nAnother important dimension of the human/person distinction is also\nsignaled in this example, viz. the person as locus of moral\naccountability. On Locke\u2019s view, it is in virtue of their\ncapacities for self-consciousness and rationality that persons not\nonly persist through time, but also are prudentially concerned and\nmorally and legally responsible for actions committed at other times.\nAccording to Locke, a person should be punished only for those actions\nthat she can remember having committed (II.xxvii.20). This is true not\nonly in the case of divine law carried out on judgment day\u2014when\n\u201cthe secrets of all Hearts shall be laid open\u201d\nand rewards and punishments meted out for the good and bad deeds\nundertaken throughout the course of our lives (II.xxvii.26)\u2014but\nalso, more generally, in the course of everyday legal and moral\naffairs. So it is that \u2018person\u2019 functions as \u201ca\nForensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit\u201d (ibid.)\nand in \u201cpersonal Identity is founded all the Right and\nJustice of Reward and Punishment\u201d (II.xxvii.18).\n\nIn discussing these normative aspects of personhood, Locke raises and\nanswers an obvious objection in a way that anticipates some strains of\nthe contemporary debate. \u201cSuppose\u201d, he says,\n\n\nI wholly lose the memory of some parts of my Life, beyond a\npossibility of retrieving them, so that perhaps I shall never be\nconscious of them again; yet am I not the same Person, that did those\nActions, had those Thoughts, that I was once conscious of, though I\nhave now forgot them? (II.xxvii.20)\n\n\nLocke replies that, although they typically refer to both the same\nhuman animal and the same person, self-referring personal pronouns can\nbe equivocal. So the question \u201cDid I do such and so?\u201d can\nbe ambiguous as between \u201cDid the person to which \u2018I\u2019\npresently refers do such and so?\u201d and \u201cDid the human\nanimal to which \u2018I\u2019 presently refers do such and\nso?\u201d In Locke\u2019s amnesiac case, the answer to the first\nquestion is no, while the answer to the second question is yes:\n\u201cthe Word I is applied to \u2026 the Man only\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nTwo aspects of Locke\u2019s discussion of this case are salient to\nthe contemporary discussion. The first, of course, is the view that,\nif I am incapable of recalling having done this or that, then the\nperson responsible for the action in question is not the person I am,\neven if the person who is responsible for that action occupied the\nsame human animal presently occupied by the person I am (see Johansson\n2016, D. Shoemaker 2009, 2016, and Sauchelli 2017a). The second is the\nidea that the first-person pronoun can refer equivocally in a way that\n tracks the human/person distinction (see\n section 3.2).\n\nA host of interpretive questions can be raised concerning the\nhistorical distinction between human animals and persons, and some of\nthese may be of interest to participants in the contemporary debate\nbetween animalism and its rivals. For example, whether Locke\u2019s\ndistinction reflects a conceptual or an ontological difference remains\na point of controversy amongst historians of the period (e.g., Bolton\n1994; Chappell 1989; Thiel 1997 and 1998). But setting aside these\nscholarly matters, the features of Locke\u2019s distinction that are\nuncontroversially endorsed by Locke as well as especially relevant for\nthe current debate include the following:\n\nour capacities for self-consciousness and rationality are tied not\nto our being human animals, but to our being persons;\n the locus of moral responsibility is not the human animal, but\nthe person;\n persons, but not human animals, persist just in case their\npsychological states are linked in appropriate ways; and\n during the course of its life, a human animal may coincide with\nzero, one, or more than one person, and something need not be a human\nanimal in order to be occupied by a person (e.g., Locke\u2019s\nrational parrot).\n\n",
