    "main_text": "\n\nGiordano Bruno (1548\u20131600) was one of the most adventurous\nthinkers of the Renaissance. Supremely confident in his intellectual\nabilities, he ridiculed Aristotelianism, especially its contemporary\nadherents. Copernicus\u2019s heliocentric theory provided a starting\npoint for his exposition of what he called a \u201cnew\nphilosophy\u201d. It disproved the axioms of Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy, notably the idea that sublunary elements occupied or\nstrove to return to their natural places, that is, the elemental\nspheres, at the centre of the cosmos. Concomitantly, it disproved the\nexistence of a superlunary region composed entirely of incorruptible\naether circling the earth and hence disproved Aristotle\u2019s\nprincipal argument for supposing that the universe was finite. The\nuniverse was infinite, animate and populated by numberless solar\nsystems. It was also eternal. As such, it exhibited all possibilities\nat any given moment, and all parts of it assumed all possibilities\nover time, thereby constituting a cognizable manifestation of a\ntimeless and absolute principle, God, conceived as the sole being who\ntruly existed. In keeping with these ideas, Bruno proposed versions of\nmetempsychosis, polygenism, panpsychism and, renouncing Christian\nemphases on human imperfection, advocated a morality that exhorted\nindividuals to perfect their intellectual powers.\n",
