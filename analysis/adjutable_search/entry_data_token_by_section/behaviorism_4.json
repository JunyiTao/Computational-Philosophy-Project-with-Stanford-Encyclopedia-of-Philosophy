    "main_text": "Why be a Behaviorist\n5. Why be a Behaviorist\n\nWhy would anyone be a behaviorist? There are three main reasons (see\nalso Zuriff 1985).\n\nThe first reason is epistemic or evidential. Warrant or evidence for\nsaying, at least in the third person case, that an animal or person is\nin a certain mental state, for example, possesses a certain belief, is\ngrounded in behavior, understood as observable behavior. Moreover, the\nconceptual space or step between the claim that behavior warrants the\nattribution of belief and the claim that believing consists in\nbehavior itself is a short and in some ways appealing step. If we\nlook, for example, at how people are taught to use mental concepts and\nterms\u2014terms like \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cdesire\u201d,\nand so on\u2014conditions of use appear inseparably connected with\nbehavioral tendencies in certain circumstances. If mental state\nattribution bears a special connection with behavior, it is tempting\nto say that mentality just consists in behavioral tendencies.\n\nThe second reason can be expressed as follows: One major difference\nbetween mentalistic (mental states in-the-head) and associationist or\nconditioning accounts of behavior is that mentalistic accounts tend to\nhave a strong nativist bent. This is true even though there may be\nnothing inherently nativist about mentalistic accounts (see Cowie\n1998).\n\nMentalistic accounts tend to assume, and sometimes even explicitly to\nembrace (see Fodor 1981), the hypothesis that the mind possesses at\nbirth or innately a set of procedures or internally represented\nprocessing rules which are deployed when learning or acquiring new\nresponses. Behaviorism, by contrast, is anti-nativist. Behaviorism,\ntherefore, appeals to theorists who deny that there are innate rules\nby which organisms learn. To Skinner and Watson organisms learn\nwithout being innately or pre-experientially provided with implicit\nprocedures by which to learn. Learning does not consist, at least\ninitially, in rule-governed behavior. Learning is what organisms do in\nresponse to stimuli. For a behaviorist an organism learns, as it were,\nfrom its successes and mistakes. \u201cRules,\u201d says Skinner\n(1984a), \u201care derived from contingencies, which specify\ndiscriminative stimuli, responses, and consequences\u201d (p. 583).\n(See also Dennett 1978).\n\nMuch contemporary work in cognitive science on the set of models known\nas connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) models seems\nto share behaviorism\u2019s anti-nativism about learning. PDP model\nbuilding takes an approach to learning which is response oriented\nrather than rule-governed and this is because, like behaviorism, it\nhas roots in associationism (see Bechtel 1985; compare Graham 1991\nwith Maloney 1991). Whether PDP models ultimately are or must be\nanti-nativist depends upon what counts as native or innate rules\n(Bechtel and Abrahamsen 1991, pp. 103\u2013105). \n\nThe third reason for behaviorism\u2019s appeal, popular at least\nhistorically, is related to its disdain for reference to inner mental\nor mentalistic information processing as explanatory causes of\nbehavior. The disdain is most vigorously exemplified in the work of\nSkinner. Skinner\u2019s skepticism about explanatory references to\nmental innerness may be described as follows.\n\nSuppose we try to explain the public behavior of a person by\ndescribing how they represent,conceptualize or think about their\nsituation. Suppose they conceive or think of their situation in a\ncertain way, not as bare, as filled with items without attributes, but\nas things, as trees, as people, as walruses, walls, and wallets.\nSuppose, we also say, a person never merely interacts with their\nenvironment; but rather interacts with their environment as they\nperceive, see, or represent it. So, for example, thinking of something\nas a wallet, a person reaches for it. Perceiving something as a\nwalrus, they back away from it. Classifying something as a wall, they\ndon\u2019t bump into it. So understood, behavior is endogenously\nproduced movement, viz. behavior that has its causal origin within the\nperson who thinks of or represents their situation in a certain\nway.\n\nSkinner would object to such claims. He would object not because he\nbelieves that the eye is innocent or that inner or endogenous activity\ndoes not occur. He would object because he believes that behavior must\nbe explained in terms that do not themselves presuppose the very thing\nthat is explained. The outside (public) behavior of a person is not\naccounted for by referring to the inside (inner processing, cognitive\nactivity) behavior of the person (say, his or her classifying or\nanalyzing their environment) if, therein, the behavior of the person\nultimately is unexplained. \u201cThe objection,\u201d wrote Skinner,\n\u201cto inner states is not that they do not exist, but that they\nare not relevant in a functional analysis\u201d (Skinner 1953, p.\n35). \u2018Not relevant\u2019 means, for Skinner, explanatorily\ncircular or regressive.\n\nSkinner charges that since mental activity is a form of behavior\n(albeit inner), the only non-regressive, non-circular way to explain\nbehavior is to appeal to something non-behavioral. This non-behavioral\nsomething is environmental stimuli and an organism\u2019s\ninteractions with, and reinforcement from, the environment.\n\nSo, the third reason for behaviorism\u2019s appeal is that it tries\nto avoid (what it claims is) circular, regressive explanations of\nbehavior. It aims to refrain from accounting for one type of behavior\n(overt) in terms of another type of behavior (covert), all the while,\nin some sense, leaving behavior unexplained.\n\nIt should be noted that Skinner\u2019s views about explanation and\nthe purported circularity of explanation by reference to inner\nprocessing are both extreme and scientifically contestable, and that\nmany who have self-identified as behaviorists including Guthrie,\nTolman, and Hull, or continue to work within the tradition, broadly\nunderstood, including Killeen (1987) and Rescorla (1990), take\nexception to much that Skinner has said about explanatory references\nto innerness. Also Skinner himself is not always clear about his\naversion to innerness. Skinner\u2019s derisive attitude towards\nexplanatory references to mental innerness stems, in part, not just\nfrom fears of explanatory circularity but from his conviction that if\nthe language of psychology is permitted to refer to internal\nprocessing, this goes some way towards permitting talk of immaterial\nmental substances, agents endowed with contra-causal free will, and\nlittle persons (homunculi) within bodies. Each of these Skinner takes\nto be incompatible with a scientific worldview (see Skinner 1971; see\nalso Day 1976). Finally, it must be noted that Skinner\u2019s\naversion to explanatory references to innerness is not an aversion to\ninner mental states or processes per se. He readily admits that\nprivate thoughts and so on exist. Skinner countenances talk of inner\nevents but only provided that their innerness is treated in the same\nmanner as public behavior or overt responses. An adequate science of\nbehavior, he claims, must describe events taking place within the skin\nof the organism as part of behavior itself (see Skinner 1976).\n\u201cSo far as I am concerned,\u201d he wrote in 1984 in a special\nissue of Behavioral and Brain Sciences devoted to his work,\n\u201cwhatever happens when we inspect a public stimulus is in every\nrespect similar to what happens when we introspect a private\none\u201d (Skinner 1984b, p. 575; compare Graham 1984, pp.\n558\u20139).\n\nSkinner does not have much to say about just how inner (covert,\nprivate) behavior (like thinking, classifying, and analyzing) can be\ndescribed in the same manner as public or overt behavior. But his idea\nis roughly as follows. Just as we may describe overt behavior or motor\nmovement in terms of concepts like stimulus, response, conditioning,\nreinforcement, and so on, so we may deploy the very same terms in\ndescribing inner or covert behavior. One thought or line of thought\nmay reinforce another thought. An act of analysis may serve as a\nstimulus for an effort at classification. And so on. Purely\n\u2018mentalistic\u2019 activities may be at least roughly parsed in\nterms of behavioral concepts \u2014 a topic to be revisited later in\nthe entry (in the 7th Section). \n",
