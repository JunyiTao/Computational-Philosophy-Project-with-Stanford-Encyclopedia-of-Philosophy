    "main_text": "Democracy and the Global System || The Global Democratic Deficit\n1.2 The Global Democratic Deficit\n\n\nThe array of transnational institutions that govern social, political,\nand economic processes is bewildering. Formal institutions include\ninternational organizations (IO), intergovernmental organizations\n(IGO), non-governmental organizations (NGO), and private bodies\n(Tallberg et al. 2013). Informal institutions include epistemic\ncommunities, transnational networks, and the basic structure of\ntransnational norms that make the world \u2018hang together\u2019\n(Ruggie 1998).\n\n\nAs the number of these transnational institutions has increased with\nglobalization, so too has their capacity to exercise authority\n(Z\u00fcrn et al. 2012). Many scholars have noted that this authority\noften enables international institutions to wield pervasive forms of\npublic power that impact (and potentially constrain) the lives\nof individuals (Macdonald 2008). This occurs through international\nlaw-making, regulatory standard-setting, and the promotion of new\nnorms. As decisions are taken outside the state, national leaders are\nunable to control the forces which impact domestic institutions and\ncitizens. Correspondingly, and resultantly, individuals within each\nstate have no direct say in how global rules are forged. This\nundermines the notion that individuals can collectively govern their\njoint affairs. This gap\u2014between individual rule-takers and\ntransnational rule-makers\u2014is referred to as the global\ndemocratic deficit.\n\n\nThe global democratic deficit is compounded by at least three\nadditional factors. First is an issue of procedure: international\nbodies often operate with unaccountable and non-transparent processes.\nThis makes it difficult to identify the steps in a causal chain which\nlink transnational rule-makers with rule-takers. The second factor is\nscope: current arrangements of transnational institutions seem\nincapable of tackling the most pressing issues of a globalizing world\n\u2014climate change, spread of infectious diseases, volatile\nfinancial markets, enormous poverty rates, unjust supply chains, just\nto name a few. Third is an issue of constituency: globalization is\nactually reshaping who constitutes \u2018the people\u2019 due\ndemocratic standing in decision-making processes. As Andrew Linklater\n(1998) notes, globalization generates postnational communities of fate\nnot based on national boundaries but upon shared problems and mutual\nallegiances.\n\n\nThis final point bears emphasis because it has (re-)ignited debates\nin democratic theory over the so-called \u2018boundary problem\u2019:\nwho is entitled to take part in democratic decision-making processes\n(Agn\u00e9 2006)? This question is often thought to be paradoxical\nbecause democratic theory offers no internal solution for delineating\n\u2018the people\u2019: unless we already know who is eligible to\nparticipate in democratic procedures, we do not know who to include in\nthe initial decision-making process. As globalization erodes the idea\nthat the citizenry represents a natural embodiment of \u2018the\npeople\u2019, we need to search for alternate ways to justify\ndemocratic inclusion.\n\n\nAlthough a full survey is neither possible nor necessary here, two\nprominent responses have been advocated in the literature (Goodin\n2007). First, all individuals subjected to rules, laws, and\nregulations should take part in writing those rules. Second, all\nindividuals significantly affected by a decision-making\nprocess should have an equal say in how that power is exercised. While\nthese two positions provide a basis for delineating the people in a\nglobalizing world, there are clear differences between them. The former\nis relatively narrow: only individuals to whom rules actually apply\nshould be part of the decision-making. By contrast, the latter is much\nbroader: global decisions often have wide-reaching and indirect\nconsequences beyond those subjected. To take a simple example:\nindividuals in a country not a member of the WTO are not\nsubjected to WTO rules, but they are affected by the\ngeneral system of international tariffs that the WTO regulates. Should\nthese individuals be entitled to a democratic right of participation in\nWTO decisions? From this, we can see that whether we chose\nsubjectedness or affectedness matters because each criterion entails a\nsignificantly different domain of democratic inclusion. As such,\nfurther research is required to shed light on how, or even if, the\nboundary problem can be resolved, and its implications for global\ndemocracy.\n",
