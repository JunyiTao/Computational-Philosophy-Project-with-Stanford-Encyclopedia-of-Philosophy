    "main_text": "Logical fatalism: Richard Taylor\u2019s argument and the conditions of power || The conditions of power\n3.2 The conditions of power\n\nIt seems that there is an alternative to the Aristotelian solution,\nbecause Taylor\u2019s presupposition 5 seems dubious. A symptom of\nthis is that it seems to yield the fatalist conclusion a bit too\neasily. For supposing that I do not perform act S (whatever\nit is), then it follows immediately that there is lacking a necessary\ncondition for my performing S, namely the occurrence of\nS. So, if presupposition 5 is right, it follows immediately\nthat I never have the power to perform any act which I do not actually\nperform. Of course, that does not show that this conclusion is wrong;\nbut it enough to make one question the presupposition which entails\nit. And one might suggest that not only is this presupposition false,\nbut that it seems true because it is easily confused with another much\nmore plausible proposition (equivalent to Hasker\u2019s PEP5; see\nHasker 1989, 115):\n\n5\u2032. No agent can perform any given act if there is lacking, at\nthe same time or any other time, some condition which is necessary for\nthe occurrence of that act and which it is not in his power to\nbring about.\n\n\nAnd if we substitute that for Taylor\u2019s presupposition 5, the\nparallel argument is no longer sound.\n",
