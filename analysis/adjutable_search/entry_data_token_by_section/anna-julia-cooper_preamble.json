    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry takes as its focal point the philosophical contributions of\nAnna Julia Cooper with an emphasis on her scholarship and some\nattention to her commitments as an educator and activist. Authoring\none of the earliest book-length analyses of the unique situation of\nBlack women in the United States, Cooper offers clearly articulated\ninsights about racialized sexism and sexualized racism without\nignoring the significance of class and labor, education and\nintellectual development, and conceptions of democracy and\ncitizenship.[1]\n  With an academic training deeply rooted in the history\nof Western philosophy and the classics, Cooper\u2019s philosophical\nsignificance also lies in her foundational contributions to feminist\nphilosophy, standpoint theory, and epistemology, as well as critical\nphilosophy of race and African-American philosophy (including African\nAmerican political philosophy). The first two sections of this entry\nsituate Cooper by providing some context for her two best known\nwritings and then exploring the historical and contemporary reception\nof Cooper\u2019s philosophy. From here, the main topics covered include an\nin-depth analysis of her scholarship with special attention given to A\nVoice from the South By a Black Woman of the South, her dissertation\n(L\u2019attitude de la France \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de\nl\u2019esclavage pendant la revolution), and other select essays\nbeyond these two texts. The entry  concludes with a biographical\nsketch of Cooper in order to prioritize her scholarship and critically\nengage her theories (rather than commencing by recounting her life\nstory).\n\n\n",
