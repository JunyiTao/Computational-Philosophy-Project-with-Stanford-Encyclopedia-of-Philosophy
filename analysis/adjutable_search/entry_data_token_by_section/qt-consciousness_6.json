It refers to\nparticular mechanisms of information transfer at the synaptic cleft.\nHowever, ways in which these quantum processes might be relevant for\nmental activity, and in which their interactions with mental states\nare conceived, remain unclarified to the present\n day.[12]\n\n\nAs presented in\n Section 3.1,\n the information flow between neurons in chemical synapses is\ninitiated by the release of transmitters in the presynaptic terminal.\nThis process is called exocytosis, and it is triggered by an arriving\nnerve impulse with some small probability. In order to describe the\ntrigger mechanism in a statistical way, thermodynamics or quantum\nmechanics can be invoked. A look at the corresponding energy regimes\nshows (Beck and Eccles 1992) that quantum processes are\ndistinguishable from thermal processes for energies higher than\n10-2 eV (at room temperature). Assuming a typical length\nscale for biological microsites of the order of several nanometers, an\neffective mass below 10 electron masses is sufficient to ensure that\nquantum processes prevail over thermal processes.\n\nThe upper limit of the time scale of such processes in the quantum\nregime is of the order of 10-12 sec. This is significantly\nshorter than the time scale of cellular processes, which is\n10-9 sec and longer. The sensible difference between the\ntwo time scales makes it possible to treat the corresponding processes\nas decoupled from one another.\n\nThe detailed trigger mechanism proposed by Beck and Eccles (1992) is\nbased on the quantum concept of quasi-particles, reflecting the\nparticle aspect of a collective mode. Skipping the details of the\npicture, the proposed trigger mechanism refers to tunneling processes\nof two-state quasi-particles, resulting in state collapses. It yields\na probability of exocytosis in the range between 0 and 0.7, in\nagreement with empirical observations. Using a theoretical framework\ndeveloped earlier (Marcus 1956; Jortner 1976), the quantum trigger can\nbe concretely understood in terms of electron transfer between\nbiomolecules. However, the question remains how the trigger may be\nrelevant for conscious mental states. There are two aspects to this\nquestion.\n\nThe first one refers to Eccles\u2019 intention to utilize quantum\nprocesses in the brain as an entry point for mental causation. The\nidea, as indicated in\n Section 1,\n is that the fundamentally indeterministic nature of individual\nquantum state collapses offers room for the influence of mental powers\non brain states. In the present picture, this is conceived in such a\nway that \u201cmental intention (volition) becomes neurally effective\nby momentarily increasing the probability of\nexocytosis\u201d (Beck and Eccles 1992, 11360). Further\njustification of this assumption is not given.\n\nThe second aspect refers to the problem that processes at\nsingle synapses cannot be simply correlated to mental\nactivity, whose neural correlates are coherent assemblies of neurons.\nMost plausibly, prima facie uncorrelated random processes at\nindividual synapses would result in a stochastic network of neurons\n(Hepp 1999). Although Beck (2001) has indicated possibilities (such as\nquantum stochastic resonance) for achieving ordered patterns at the\nlevel of assemblies from fundamentally random synaptic processes, this\nremains an unsolved problem.\n\nWith the exception of Eccles\u2019 idea of mental causation, the\napproach by Beck and Eccles essentially focuses on brain states and\nbrain dynamics.  In this respect, Beck (2001, 109f) states explicitly\nthat \u201cscience cannot, by its very nature, present any answer to\n[\u2026] questions related to the mind\u201d. Nevertheless, their\nbiophysical approach may open the door to controlled speculation about\nmind-matter relations.\n\nA more recent proposal targeting exocytosis processes at the synaptic\ncleft is due Fisher (2015, 2017). Similar to the quasi-particles by\nBeck and Eccles, Fisher refers to so-called Posner molecules, in\nparticular to calcium phosphate, Ca\\(_9\\)(PO\\(_4\\))\\(_6\\). The nuclear\nspins of phosphate ions serve as entangled qubits within the\nmolecules, which protect their coherent states against fast\ndecoherence (resulting in extreme decoherence times in the range of\nhours or even days). If the Posner molecules are transported into\npresynaptic glutamatergic neurons, they will stimulate further\nglutamate release and amplify postsynaptic activity. Due to nonlocal\nquantum correlations this activity may be enhanced over multiple\nneurons (which would respond to Hepp\u2019s concern).\n\nThis is a sophisticated mechanism that calls for empirical tests. One\nof them would be to modify the phosphorus spin dynamics within the\nPosner molecules.  For instance, replacing Ca by different Li isotopes\nwith different nuclear spins gives rise to different decoherence\ntimes, affecting postsynaptic activity.  Corresponding evidence has\nbeen shown in animals (Sechzer et al. 1986, Krug et al. 2019). In\nfact, lithium is known to be efficacious in tempering manic phases in\npatients with bipolar disorder.\n",
