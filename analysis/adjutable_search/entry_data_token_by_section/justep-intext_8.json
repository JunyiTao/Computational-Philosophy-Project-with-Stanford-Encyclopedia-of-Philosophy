    "main_text": "Attempts to Defend Mentalism\n9. Attempts to Defend Mentalism\n\nA very strong argument for mentalism has been proposed (Conee and\nFeldman 2001). The argument has two prongs: first, we are given a\nnumber of cases in which the best explanation for why one person has a\nhigher degree of justification than another is that the first person\nhas some specific mental state; and then second, it is argued that the\nmentalist theory can satisfactorily deal with problem cases and\ncriticisms. One of the examples used in the first prong of the\nargument is this:\n\nBob and Ray are sitting in an air-conditioned hotel lobby reading\nyesterday's newspaper. Each has read that it will be very warm today\nand, on that basis, each believes that it is very warm today. Then Bob\ngoes outside and feels the heat. They both continue to believe that it\nis very warm today. But at this point Bob's belief is better\njustified.\n\n\nComment: Bob's justification for the belief was enhanced by his\nexperience of feeling the heat, and thus undergoing a mental change\nwhich so to speak \u201cinternalized\u201d the actual temperature.\nRay had just the forecast to rely on. (Conee and Feldman 2001, p.\n236)\n\n\nThe strength of this argument is that it makes use of something\nindisputable, viz., that Bob's justification is stronger than Ray's;\nand it is hard to think of any other difference between them except\nthat Bob has felt the heat and Ray has not. On the basis of this case\nand a number of similar ones, we can generalize to the conclusion that\n\u201c\u2026every variety of change that brings about or enhances\njustification either internalizes an external fact or makes a purely\ninternal difference\u201d (ibid., 238).\n\nIt is clear that this argument is not decisive, though neither is it\nclaimed to be. The number of cases it examines is very small, of\ncourse, but that is not the principal limitation. The important point\nis that enhancing one's justification, as in Bob's situation, is\ncompatible with the initial justifiers prior to enhancement being\nelements other than the mental states of the individuals involved. The\nexample of Ray and Bob, and the other examples Conee and Feldman give\nin which justification is enhanced, all assume that some degree of\njustification is already on hand before the enhancement event. Nothing\nin their examples gives us reason to suppose that initial\njustification is supplied by mental states. So, while it may be\ngranted that their argument provides some good evidence for mentalism,\nit does not go far enough by itself.\n\nThe second prong of the overall argument for menralism, however, may\nwell make up the difference. In this part of the case for mentalism, a\nnumber of important objections that have been lodged against\ninternalism are addressed, either of the accessibility or the\nmentalist variety, and it is argued that the mentalist position can\naccommodate the points made in the objections. The natural idea is\nthat meeting outstanding objections strengthens the overall argument\nfor mentalism.\n\nOne of these objections and the reply to it brings up what may be the\ndeepest and most fundamental issue dividing mentalist internalists and\nexternalists. First, the objection:\n\n\u2026every traditional form of internalism involves some appeal to\nlogical relations, probabilistic relations, or their ilk.\nFoundationalism requires that nonbasically justified beliefs stand in\nsome suitable logical or probabilistic relations to basic beliefs;\ncoherentism requires that one's system of beliefs be logically\nconsistent, probabilistically coherent, or the like. None of these\nlogical or probabilistic relations is itself a mental state, either a\nconscious or a stored state. So these relations do not qualify as\njustifiers\u2026. (Goldman 1999, 216-217)\n\n\nThe problem, in short, is that justifiers other than or in addition to\nmental states are needed if we are to explicate the justification of\nmany beliefs, and that even defenders of mentalism will have to\nrecognize this point. Not all justifiers, therefore, are mental\nstates, and so mentalism would have to be either abandoned or\nmodified.\n\nThe important question being raised by this objection is whether the\nlogical or probabilistic support relations are themselves justifiers;\nor are the justifiers confined to the entities over which the support\nrelations are to hold? If we think that these support relations\nholding between one's evidence and the beliefs are themselves\njustifiers, then mentalism is compromised (though the mixed mentalist\ntheory cited earlier as a possibility is not thereby affected). A way\nout of the difficulty would be to impose a \u201chigher order\nrequirement\u201d according to which one need be aware of these\nsupport relations. Then, one could say that being aware of these\nrelations is a justifier, as are the mental states making up one's\nevidence; and, of course, awareness is a mental state. Taking this\noption, however, leads to worries about whether all cognizers will be\nin a position to meet the high-order requirement. Recognition of\nlogical and probabilistic support relations, after all, is a fairly\nsophisticated act.\n\nA reply to this argument defends the higher-order requirement. This\nhigher order requirement, \n\n\u2026is not any implausible requirement that one have information\nabout justification. It is merely a requirement that one have evidence\nthat there is a supporting connection \u2014 for instance, the\nlogical consequence relation \u2014 between what is ordinarily\nregarded as one's evidence and what it is evidence for. This evidence\ncan come from direct insight or from any other source. This is\nevidence that people normally have in a variety [of] normal\nsituations. (Conee and Feldman 2001, 253)\n\n\nMany will think, however, that even this awareness of some support\nrelation vaguely characterized is beyond the grasp of some cognizers,\nsuch as young children, who nonetheless have perfectly justified\nbeliefs.\n\nThe other alternative would be to deny that the logical and\nprobabilistic support relations are themselves justifiers. This would\nprotect mentalism from criticism concerning logical and probabilistic\nrelations; the only justifiers would be the mental states themselves.\nJustification for a belief supported by evidence would \u201cgrow out\nof\u201d that evidence with no need for awareness of the support\nconnections.Here is a suggestion for how this might work for very\nsimple cases.\n\nThe general idea is that some propositions, p and q,\nhave a primitive or basic epistemic connection. If p and\nq have this connection, then, necessarily, if a person has a\njustified belief in p, then the person is also justified in\nbelieving q. Perhaps it is part of understanding p\nthat one grasps the connection between p and q.\nThere is, then, no need for additional information about the link\nbetween p and q that a person who is justified in\nbelieving p might lack. (ibid., 252)\n\n\nThe key idea here is what it is to understand a proposition\np. The suggestion is that in very simple cases, where the\nlogical connection between p and q is immediate,\npart of one's understanding of p is to also believe\nq.\n\nThis line of argument depends squarely on a concept of understanding a\nproposition, and its prospect for success awaits development of a\ntheory of understanding. Even if this can be developed in a promising\nway, however, it will work only for very simple logical connections.\nFor more complex logical relations and probabilistic ones holding\nbetween one's evidence and one's belief, the only available mentalist\nalternative would be to embrace the idea of awareness of the support\nrelations. This higher order requirement does not seem to be satisfied\nin all the remaining cases where the support relations have any degree\nof complexity.\n",
