    "main_text": "\n\nTrope theory is the view that reality is (wholly or partly) made up\nfrom tropes. Tropes are things like the particular shape, weight, and\ntexture of an individual object. Because tropes are particular, for\ntwo objects to \u2018share\u2019 a property (for them both to\nexemplify, say, a particular shade of green) is for each to contain\n(instantiate, exemplify) a greenness-trope, where those\ngreenness-tropes, although numerically distinct, nevertheless exactly\nresemble each other.\n\nApart from this very thin core assumption\u2014that there are\ntropes\u2014different trope theories need not have very much in\n common.[1]\n Most trope theorists (but not all) believe\nthat\u2014fundamentally\u2014there is nothing but tropes. Most trope\ntheorists (but, again, not all) hold that resemblance between concrete\nparticulars is to be explained in terms of resemblance between their\nrespective tropes. And most (but not all) hold that resemblance\nbetween tropes is determined by their primitive intrinsic nature.\n\nThat there are tropes seems prima facie reasonable if we\nreflect on such things as perception (I don\u2019t see color in\ngeneral, but the color of this object) and causation (it\u2019s the\nweight of this object that leaves an impression in the palm of my\nhand, not weight in general). Yet, neither perception nor causation\nmanage to distinguish between a theory positing tropes and one\npositing, e.g., states of affairs (universal-exemplifications), which\nmeans that the support they provide in favor of tropes is weak at\nbest.\n\nPrima facie reasons to one side, no matter which terms they\nuse to characterize their posits, most trope theorists agree that\ntropes occupy the sweet spot between universal realism and classical\nnominalism, something that they believe allows them to reap all the\nbenefits of both of those views without having to suffer any of their\ndisadvantages. More precisely, in accepting the existence of\nproperties (or, at least, something \u2018property-like\u2019), the\ntrope theorist accepts an ontology that is fine-grained enough to be\nable to explain how distinct concrete particulars can be\nsimultaneously similar to, and different from, each other (something\nthe classical nominalist arguably fails to do, cf. Armstrong\n1978). And in rejecting the existence of universals, she avoids having\nto accept the existence of a kind of entity many find mysterious,\ncounterintuitive, and \u2018unscientific\u2019 (Schaffer 2001: 249f;\nMolnar 2003: 22\u201325; and Armstrong 2005: 310).\n\nIn this entry, reasons both for and against the existence of tropes\nare surveyed. As we shall see, what those reasons are, and how well\nthey manage to support (or cause trouble for) the trope-theoretical\nthesis, depends on which version of the trope view they concern. Much\nof the entry will therefore be dedicated to distinguishing different\nversions of the theory from each other, and to see what costs and\nbenefits adopting either version brings with it.\n",
