    "main_text": "Current Views on Thought Experiments || The Mental\u2013Model Account\n5. Going Forward\n\nThe mental\u2013model approach is one of the most promising of all\nthe accounts the literature on thought experiments has to offer, and\nthis for several reasons. First, it does not seem to be much of a\nstretch to draw connections to the intuition\u2013based account. In\nfact, intuitions maybe the missing link to connect the essentially\nnon-propositional activities surrounding mental models, on the one\nhand, and the propositional aspects of thought experiments, on the\nother. After all, thought experiments involve propositional reasoning,\nand somehow the non-propositional and propositional aspects of thought\nexperiments must be linked in any account of thought experiments. This\nis urgent insofar as thought experiments are credited with a\nmeaningful role in theory discovery and theory choice. Second, the\nmental\u2013model approach also allows for inclusion of important\nelements of experimentalism and the argument\u2013view. Thought\nexperiments are realized in the mind on mental models, and the method\nof variation is employed such that the results of the experiment may\nbe subject to a careful reconstruction of propositional lines of\nreasoning to submit it for careful assessment and critique. Third, the\nmental\u2013model approach enables us to bring an aspect into focus\nthat has been widely neglected in the discussion so far: the bodily\ncomponent of (thought) experiments. The exception is the work of the\nlate David Gooding (1992, 1993, 1994, and 1999). Fourth, in critical\nengagement with such naturalistic proposals, those theories of the\nbody may be put to work that the philosophical school of phenomenology\nhas produced (see Fehige and Wiltsche 2013). To be welcomed,\ntherefore, is the entry of phenomenology into the discussion on\nthought experiments (see Hopp 2014; Wiltsche 2018). Fifth, the\nmental\u2013model account also relates naturally to the most\nintriguing discussions about the role of literary fiction in thought\nexperiments.\n\nSome have placed \u201cliterary fiction on the level of thought\nexperiments\u201d (Swirski 2007, p. 6). There are two readings of\nsuch a claim. According to the first, some literary fiction may be of\ncognitive power due to the fact that they are thought experiments. In\nother words, we shouldn\u2019t outright reject the idea that\nliterature can be of cognitive value. Dystopian novels such as\nOrwell\u2019s 1984 and Huxley\u2019s Brave New\nWorld are obvious examples. According to the second reading, the\npower of thought experiments is partially a function of the narrative\nthat conveys it. The work of Novalis remains relevant for the\nexploration of this link between narrative development and thought\nexperiment: experimental writing and experiments on imagined scenarios\ngo hand in hand; words and thoughts coincide; mind and matter are\nentangled (see Daiber 2001). According to the mental\u2013model\napproach, both readings have a valid point. Literary fiction and\nnarratives of thought experiments can be powerful in establishing\nmental models in such a way that we can even learn new things about\nthe world at times from the fictional elements of them. The common\ndenominator is the work on mental models each may facilitate. It is in\nthis context that an appreciation can grow for Catherine Elgin\u2019s\ntheory of exemplification to argue against the \u201cvalorization of\ntruth in epistemology\u201d (2004, p. 113). This is also the place to\nconsider Andras Kertesz\u2019s (2015) work on conceptual metaphor\nresearch in its relevance to the epistemological puzzle that thought\nexperiments pose.\n\nFinally, sixth, mention could be made of visual reasoning in\nmathematics, which often seems closely related to thought experiments.\nThe standard view of mathematics is that the one and only source of\nevidence is a proof, and a proof is a derivation from axioms or first\nprinciples. Let\u2019s overlook the problem of where the first\nprinciples come from. A simple example such as the following casts\ndoubt on the standard view:\n\n\nTheorem: 1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + n = n2/2 + n/2\n\nProof: See Figure 7.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Picture proof.\n\n\nThe proof works like this: Start at the top and work down, letting the\nlittle squares represent numbers, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5. The\ntotal number of squares in the picture is equal to this sum. Notice\nalso that the numbers of squares is equal to a large square with sides\nof length 5 that is cut in half along the diagonal, i.e.,\n52/2, plus the shaded bits that were cut off by\nthe diagonal cut, i.e., 5/2. It is plausible to claim that\nthe diagram is a perfectly good proof of the theorem. One can\n\u201csee\u201d complete generality in the picture. Even though it\nonly illustrates the theorem for n = 5, somehow we can see\nthat it works for every number, all infinitely many of them. The\ndiagram does not implicitly suggest a \u201crigorous\u201d verbal or\nsymbolic proof. The regular proof of this theorem is by mathematical\ninduction, but the diagram does not correspond to an inductive proof\nat all, since the key element in an inductive proof is the passage\nfrom n to n + 1. The simple moral we could draw from\nthe example is just this: We can in special cases correctly infer\ntheorems from pictures, that is, from visualizable situations. There\nis an intuition and from this intuition we can grasp the truth of the\ntheorem (see Brown 1999 [2008]).\n\nOur assessment of the prospects of the mental\u2013model account is\nvery rough and speculative, though certainly not implausible. Of\ncourse, there are challenges to such a vision of a greater synthesis\nof the many different takes on thought experiments under the umbrella\nof the mental-model account. For example, some see additional support\narising for the argument\u2013view from computer simulations (see\nBeisbart 2012). Others find that \u201ccomputational modeling is\nlargely replacing thought experimenting, and the latter will play only\na limited role in future practice of science, especially in the\nsciences of complex nonlinear, dynamical phenomena\u201d (see\nChandrasekharan et al. 2012, p. 239). But, there are also\nproposals such as that by Marcus Schulzke (2014) to think of video\ngames philosophically as executable thought experiments. Whatever the\nmerits of this particular proposal, future explorations of the\nrelationship between computer simulations and thought experiments can\nbuild on outcomes of closer inquiries into it (see Behmel 2001, pp.\n98\u2013108; Di Paolo et al. 2000; El Skaf and Imbert 2013;\nLenhard 2011; St\u00e4udner 1998; Lenhard 2018). The work on the\nnature of the importance of scientific understanding (see, e.g.,\nStuart 2018) will inform that exploration as much as the fruits of\ncontinuing efforts to clarify the role of the imagination in thought\nexperiments (see, e.g., Meynell 2014; Stuart 2017 and 2021).\n\nWe conclude with an interesting, but still relatively unexplored issue\nthat concerns the relative importance of thought experiments in\ndifferent disciplines. Physics and philosophy use them extensively.\nChemistry, by contrast, seems to attract less attention in this\nrespect. Why is this the case? Perhaps it is merely an historical\naccident that chemists never developed a culture of doing thought\nexperiments. Perhaps it is tied to some deep feature of the discipline\nitself (see Snooks 2006). Economics and history use thought\nexperiments, but apparently not anthropology. A good explanation would\nlikely tell us a lot about the structure of these disciplines.\n\nRelated to this is the question of the difference, if any, between\nthought experiments in the sciences and those in philosophy. We have\nassumed throughout this entry that they are the same kind of thing.\nNot everyone sees them this way, so perhaps it should be considered an\nopen question. On the one hand, philosophy and science seem to many to\nbe different kinds of activities. That might suggest that thought\nexperiments would differ in the two areas. On the other hand, there is\na huge difference between thought experiments within a single field,\ne.g., Newton\u2019s bucket attempts to establish absolute space while\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat aims to show QM as then understood to be\nabsurd. Is the difference between them less than the difference\nbetween either of them and Searle\u2019s Chinese Room or\nThomson\u2019s violinist? The case one way or the other is not\nobvious. Of course, there are differences between constructive and\ndestructive thought experiments, but this is true within any\ndiscipline. Perhaps for now the default attitude ought to be that\nthere is no categorical difference between scientific and\nphilosophical thought experiments. This should not be treated as a\ndogmatic principle, but rather a stimulus to look deeper for important\nsubtle contrasts.\n",
