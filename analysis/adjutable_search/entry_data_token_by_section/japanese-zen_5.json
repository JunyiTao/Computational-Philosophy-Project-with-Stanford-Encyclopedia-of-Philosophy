    "main_text": "The Practice: Three-Step Process || The Adjustment of the Mind\n3.3 The Adjustment of the Mind\n\nOnce the bodily posture and the breathing are adjusted, the\npractitioner next learns to adjust the mind. This means that the\npractitioner consciously moves to enter a state of meditation. In so\ndoing, the practitioner learns to disengage him- or herself from the\nconcerns of daily life. That is to say, one tries to stop the\noperation of the conscious mind. However, if one tries to stop the mind by\nusing one\u2019s mind, the mind which is trying to stop itself is\nstill operative. In other words, it is practically impossible to stop\nthe mind by using the mind. Instead, Zen tries to accomplish this by\nthe immobile bodily posture and the breathing exercise. In this\nconnection, it will be informative to know how the practitioner\nexperiences breathing as he or she deepens meditation.\n\nWe can identify three basic stages: initially\nthe practitioner can hear the audible sound of the in-coming and\nout-going breaths. This is rough and \u201cgross\u201d breathing.\nThis is followed by the second stage in which he or she can feel the\npathway of the in-coming and out-going breaths. Breathing at this\npoint becomes \u201csubtle\u201d in that there will no longer be\naudible sound of the breaths but simply a stream of life-energy. In\nthe third stage there is no more feeling of the in-coming and\nout-going breaths. When this occurs, the practitioner can settle into\na deeper meditational state. Also, it is significant to note that as\nthe practitioner enters a deeper state of meditation, the interval\nbetween inhalation and exhalation is prolonged, i.e., the retention of\nbreath is prolonged, as the reduction of breathing activities\noccurs.\n\nMeditation trains one to sit face-to-face with one\u2019s self, while\ncreating a psychological isolation from the external world. With this,\none enters into an internal world of psych\u0113. As the\npractitioner attempts to enter the world of psych\u0113,\nvarious things start surfacing in the field of the\npractitioner\u2019s meditative awareness. These are mostly things of\nconcern that have occupied the practitioner in the history of his or\nher life, or things the practitioner has consciously suppressed for\nvarious reasons. Initially, the practitioner experiences recent\ndesires, anxieties, concerns, ideas, and images that have surfaced in\nhis or her daily life. A psychological reason that the practitioner\nexperiences these various things is due in part to the fact the\npractitioner has lowered the level of conscious activity, by assuming\nthe meditation posture, and doing the breathing exercise. This\nmechanism is the same as when one has a dream at night. When the level\nof consciousness is lowered, the suppressive power of\nego-consciousness weakens, and consequently the autonomous\nactivity of the unconscious begins to surface.\n\nHowever, these desires, images and ideas are distractions insofar as\nmeditation is concerned. This is because in meditation you must learn\nto focus your awareness on one thing. One must learn just to observe\nwithout getting involved in them. That is, one must learn to\ndis-identify oneself with them. In the process of deepening\nmeditation, one can roughly identify three distinct stages: the stage\nof concentration, the stage of meditation, and the stage of\nabsorption. In the stage of concentration, the practitioner\nconcentrates, for example on the lower abdomen, establishing\na dualistic relationship between the practitioner who is\nconcentrating and the lower abdomen that is the focus of\nconcentration. This dualistic relationship is broken gradually as the\npractitioner moves into the stage of meditation. The activity of the\nego-consciousness is gradually lessened, and the barriers it sets up for\nitself are gradually removed. When the practitioner enters the stage\nof absorption (sam\u0101dhi), the dualistic framing of the mind\nwill be removed such that the mind starts structuring itself\nnon-dualistically. There will be no separation or distancing between\nan object of the mind and the activity of the mind itself. \n\nAs the practitioner repeats this process over a long period of time,\nhe or she will come to experience a state in which no-thing appears.\nZen uses the phrase \u201cno-mind\u201d to designate this state.\nNo-mind does not mean a mindless state. Nor does it mean that there is\nno mind. It means that there is no conscious activity of the mind that\nis associated with ego-consciousness in the everyday standpoint. In\nother word, no-mind is a free mind that is not delimited by ideas,\ndesires, and images. No-mind is a state of mind in which there is\nneither a superimposition of ideas nor a psychological projection.\nThat is, no-mind is a practical transcendence from the everyday mind,\nwithout departing from the everydayness of the world.\n",
