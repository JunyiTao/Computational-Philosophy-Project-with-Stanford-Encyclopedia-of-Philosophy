He states that \u201cno event has occurred\nthat could have been more decisive for the fate of this science than\nthe attack made upon it by David Hume\u201d and goes on to say that\n\u201cHume proceeded primarily from a single but important concept of\nmetaphysics, namely, that of the connection of cause and\neffect\u201d (4, 257; 7; see the Bibliography for our method of\ncitation). Over the next few pages Kant defends the importance of\nHume\u2019s \u201cattack\u201d on metaphysics against common-sense\nopponents such as Thomas Reid, James Oswald, James Beattie, and Joseph\nPriestley (all of whom, according to Kant, missed the point of\nHume\u2019s problem), and Kant then famously writes (4, 260; 10):\n\n\n\nI freely admit that it was the remembrance of David Hume which, many\nyears ago, first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my\ninvestigations in the field of speculative philosophy a completely\ndifferent direction. \n\n\nThus, it was Hume\u2019s \u201cattack\u201d on metaphysics (and, in\nparticular, on the concept of cause and effect) which first provoked\nKant himself to undertake a fundamental reconsideration of this\n(supposed) science.\n\nLater, in \u00a7\u00a7 27\u201330 of the Prolegomena, Kant\nreturns to Hume\u2019s problem and presents his own solution. Kant\nbegins, in \u00a7 27, by stating that \u201chere is now the place to\nremove the Humean doubt from the ground up\u201d (4, 310; 63); and he\ncontinues, in \u00a7 29, by proposing \n\n\nto make a trial with Hume\u2019s problematic concept (his\ncrux metaphysicorum), namely the concept of cause.\n(4, 312; 65) \n\n\nKant concludes, in \u00a7 30, by stating that we are now in possession\nof \u201ca complete solution of the Humean problem\u201d (4, 313;\n66)\u2014which, Kant adds, \n\n\nrescues the a priori origin of the pure concepts of the understanding\nand the validity of the general laws of nature as laws of the\nunderstanding, in such a way that their use is limited only to\nexperience, because their possibility has its ground merely in the\nrelation of the understanding to experience, however, not in such a\nway that they are derived from experience, but that experience is\nderived from them, a completely reversed kind of connection which\nnever occurred to Hume. (ibid.) \n\n\nThus, Kant\u2019s \u201ccomplete solution of the Humean\nproblem\u201d directly involves him with his whole revolutionary\ntheory of the constitution of experience by the a priori concepts and\nprinciples of the understanding\u2014and with his revolutionary\nconception of synthetic a priori judgments.\n\nIndeed, when Kant first introduces Hume\u2019s problem in the Preface\nto the Prolegomena he already indicates that the problem is\nactually much more general, extending to all of the categories of the\nunderstanding (4, 260; 10): \n\n\nI thus first tried whether Hume\u2019s objection might not be\nrepresented generally, and I soon found that the concept of the\nconnection of cause and effect is far from being the only one by which\nthe understanding thinks connections of things a priori; rather,\nmetaphysics consists wholly and completely of them. I sought to secure\ntheir number, and since this succeeded as desired, namely, from a\nsingle principle, I then proceeded to the deduction of these concepts,\non the basis of which I was now assured that they are not derived from\nexperience, as Hume had feared, but have sprung from the pure\nunderstanding. \n\n\nMoreover, Kant soon explains, in \u00a7 5, how this more general\nproblem (common to all the categories and principles of the\nunderstanding) is to be formulated: \u201cHow is cognition from pure\nreason possible?\u201d (4, 275; 27), or, more specifically,\n\u201cHow are synthetic a priori propositions possible?\u201d (4,\n276; 28).\n\nIn the Introduction to the second (B) edition of the Critique of\nPure Reason (1787), Kant follows the Prolegomena in\nformulating what he here calls \u201cthe general problem of pure\nreason\u201d (B19): \u201cHow are synthetic a priori judgments\npossible?\u201d And, as in the Prolegomena, Kant insists\nthat the possibility of metaphysics as a science entirely depends on\nthis problem (ibid.): \n\n\nThat metaphysics until now has remained in such a wavering state of\nuncertainty and contradictions is to be ascribed solely to the fact\nthat this problem, and perhaps even the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic judgments, was not thought of\nearlier. Metaphysics stands or falls with the solution of this\nproblem, or on a satisfactory proof that the possibility it requires\nto be explained does not in fact obtain. \n\n\nKant then immediately refers to \u201cDavid Hume, who, among all\nphilosophers, came closest to this problem\u201d; and he suggests,\nonce again, that Hume failed to perceive the solution because he did\nnot conceive the problem in its \n\n\n[full] generality, but rather stopped with the synthetic proposition\nof the connection of the effect with the cause (principium\ncausalitatis). (ibid.)\n\n\nIt is only in the second edition of the Critique that Kant\ngives such a prominent place to Hume and his \u201cobjection\u201d\nto causality, serving to introduce what Kant now calls \u201cthe\ngeneral problem of pure reason\u201d. By contrast, the name of Hume\ndoes not appear in either the Introduction or the Transcendental\nAnalytic in the first (A) edition (1781): it appears only in the\nTranscendental Doctrine of Method at the very end of the book, in a\ndiscussion of \u201cskepticism\u201d versus \u201cdogmatism\u201d\nin metaphysics (where Hume\u2019s skepticism about causation, in\nparticular, is finally explicitly discussed). This is not to say, of\ncourse, that implicit references to Hume are not found earlier in the\ntext of the first edition. Thus, for example, in a preliminary section\nto the Transcendental Deduction Kant illustrates the need for such a\ndeduction with the concept of cause, and in both editions remarks\n(A91/B124): \n\n\nAppearances certainly provide cases from which a rule is possible in\naccordance with which something usually happens, but never that the\nsuccession is necessary; therefore, a dignity pertains to the\nsynthesis of cause and effect that cannot be empirically expressed at\nall, namely, that the effect does not merely follow upon the cause but\nis posited through it and follows from it. \n\n\nBut it is only in the second edition that Kant then goes on to mention\n\u201cDavid Hume\u201d explicitly, as one who attempted to derive\nthe pure concepts of the understanding from experience (B127): \n\n\nnamely, from a subjective necessity arising from frequent association\nin experience\u2014i.e., from custom\u2014which is\nsubsequently falsely taken for objective. \n\n\nThis striking difference between the two editions clearly reflects the\nimportance of the intervening appearance of the\nProlegomena.\n\nGiven the crucial importance of the Prolegomena in this\nrespect, it is natural to return to Kant\u2019s famous remarks in the\nPreface to that work, where, as we have seen, Kant says that \n\n\nit was the remembrance of David Hume which, many years ago, first\ninterrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations in the\nfield of speculative philosophy a completely different direction. \n\n\nIt is natural to wonder, in particular, about the precise years to\nwhich Kant is referring and the specific events in his intellectual\ndevelopment he has in mind. Here, however, we now enter controversial\nterrain, where there are basically two competing\nalternatives\u2014both of which reflect the circumstance that Kant\ncould read Hume only in German translation.\n\nKant might be referring, on the one hand, to the late 1750s to mid\n1760s. A translation of Hume\u2019s Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (originally published in 1748) appeared in 1755 and\nwas widely read in Germany. Kant had almost certainly read this\ntranslation by the mid 1760s, by which time he himself expressed\ndoubts about whether causal connections could be known by reason alone\nand even suggested that they were knowable only by experience. Or, on\nthe other hand, Kant might be referring to the mid 1770s. After the\nInaugural Dissertation appeared in 1770, Kant published\nnothing more until the first edition of the Critique in 1781.\nMeanwhile, a German translation of Beattie\u2019s Essay on the\nNature and Immutability of Truth (originally published in 1770)\nappeared in 1772, where, in particular, Beattie quoted extensively\nfrom Book 1 of Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature\n(originally published in 1739). Thus, in the famous \u201cdogmatic\nslumber\u201d passage, Kant might be referring either to the mid\n1760s, when he then had a \u201cremembrance\u201d of reading the\ntranslation of Hume\u2019s Enquiry, or to the mid 1770s,\nwhen he then had a \u201cremembrance\u201d of reading translations\nfrom the\n Treatise.[1]\n\nWe prefer the first alternative. From this point of view, the decisive\nevent to which Kant is referring is his reading of Hume\u2019s\nEnquiry (in translation) during the late 1750s to mid 1760s,\nand this event, we believe, is clearly reflected in two important\nwritings of the mid 1760s: the Attempt to Introduce the Concept of\nNegative Magnitudes into Philosophy (1763) and Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer Explained by Dreams of Metaphysics (1766).\n\nIn the first (1763) essay Kant introduces the distinction between\n\u201clogical grounds\u201d and \u201creal grounds\u201d, both of\nwhich indicate a relationship between a \u201cground\u201d (cause or\nreason) and a \u201cconsequent\u201d (following from this ground).\nKant explains his problem as follows (2, 202; 239):\n\n\nI understand very well how a consequent may be posited through a\nground in accordance with the rule of identity, because it is found to\nbe contained in [the ground] by the analysis of concepts. \u2026\n[A]nd I can clearly comprehend this connection of the ground with the\nconsequent, because the consequent is actually identical with part of\nthe concept of the ground \u2026. However, how something may flow\nfrom another, but not in accordance with the rule of identity, is\nsomething that I would very much like to have made clear to me. I call\nthe first kind of ground a logical ground, because its relation to the\nconsequent can be logically comprehended in accordance with the rule\nof identity, but I call the second kind of ground a real ground,\nbecause this relation indeed belongs to my true concepts, but the\nmanner of this [relation] can in no way be estimated. With respect to\nsuch a real ground and its relation to the consequent, I pose my\nquestion in this simple form: how can I understand the circumstance\nthat, because something is, something else is to be? A\nlogical consequent is only posited because it is identical with the\nground.\n\n\nThe fundamental problem with the relationship between a real ground\nand its consequent, therefore, is that the consequent is not\nidentical with either the ground or a part of this concept\u2014i.e.,\nit is not \u201ccontained in [the ground] by the analysis of\nconcepts\u201d.\n\nThus, using his well-known later terminology (from the\nCritique and the Prolegomena), Kant is here saying\nthat, in the case of a real ground, the relationship between the\nconcept of the consequent (e.g., an effect) and the concept of the\nground (e.g., a cause) is not one of containment, and the judgment\nthat the former follows from the latter is therefore not\nanalytic. Moreover, although Kant does not explicitly refer\nto Hume in the essay on Negative Magnitudes, he proceeds to\nillustrate his problem with an example (among others) of the causal\nconnection in the communication of motion by impact (2, 202; 240):\n\n\n\nA body A is in motion, another B is at rest in the\nstraight line [of this motion]. The motion of A is something,\nthat of B is something else, and, nevertheless, the latter is\nposited through the former. \n\n\nHume famously uses this example (among others) in the Enquiry\nto illustrate his thesis that cause and effect are entirely distinct\nevents, where the idea of the latter is in no way contained in the\nidea of the former (EHU 4.9; SBN 29): \n\n\nThe mind can never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause, by\nthe most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the effect is totally\ndifferent from the cause, and consequently can never be discovered in\nit. Motion in the second billiard-ball is a quite distinct event from\nmotion in the first; nor is there anything in the one to suggest the\nsmallest hint of the other. \n\n\nA few lines later Hume describes this example as follows (EHU 4.10;\nSBN 29): \n\n\nWhen I see, for instance, a billiard-ball moving in a straight line\ntowards another; even suppose motion in the second ball should by\naccident be suggested to me, as the result of their contact or\nimpulse; may I not conceive, that a hundred different events might as\nwell follow from the cause? \u2026 All these suppositions are\nconsistent and conceivable.\n\n\nIn Kant\u2019s second essay from this period, Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer (1766), he goes further: he suggests a Humean\nsolution to the problem he had posed, but did not solve, in the essay\non Negative Magnitudes. Kant suggests, more specifically,\nthat the relation between a real ground and its consequent can only be\ngiven by experience (2, 370; 356):\n\n\nIt is impossible ever to comprehend through reason how something could\nbe a cause or have a force, rather these relations must be taken\nsolely from experience. For the rule of our reason extends only to\ncomparison in accordance with identity and\ncontradiction. But, in so far as something is a cause, then,\nthrough something, something else is posited, and\nthere is thus no connection in virtue of agreement to be\nfound\u2014just as no contradiction will ever arise if I wish to view\nthe former not as a cause, because there is no contradiction [in the\nsupposition that] if something is posited, something else is\ncancelled. Therefore, if they are not derived from experience, the\nfundamental concepts of things as causes, of forces and activities,\nare completely arbitrary and can neither be proved nor refuted.\n\n\nThis passage seems clearly to recall the main ideas in section 4, part\n1 of Hume\u2019s Enquiry. After distinguishing between\n\u201crelations of ideas\u201d and \u201cmatters of fact\u201d,\nand asserting that the former \u201care discoverable by the mere\noperation of thought\u201d (EHU 4.1; SBN 25), Hume continues (EHU\n4.2; SBN 25): \n\n\nMatters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not\nascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth,\nhowever great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of\nevery matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a\ncontradiction \u2026. \n\n\nHume then explains that: \u201call reasonings concerning matters of\nfact seem to be founded on the relation of Cause and\nEffect\u201d (EHU 4.4; SBN 26) and adds (EHU 4.6; SBN 27): \n\n\nI shall venture to affirm, as a general proposition, which admits of\nno exception, that the knowledge of this relation is not, in any\ninstance, attained by reasonings a priori; but arises\nentirely from experience, when we find that any particular objects are\nconstantly conjoined with each other. \n\n\nFinally (EHU 4.10; SBN 29): \n\n\nAnd as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in\nall natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience;\nso must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause\nand effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible that\nany other effect could result from the operation of that cause. \n\n\nThus, although Kant does not explicitly mention Hume in Dreams of\na Spirit-Seer, the parallels with Hume\u2019s Enquiry\nare striking\n indeed.[2]\n\nKant does not endorse a Humean solution to the problem of the relation\nbetween cause and effect in the critical period (beginning with the\nfirst edition of the Critique in 1781): he does not (as he\nhad in Dreams of a Spirit-Seer) claim that this relation is\nderived from experience. Instead (as we have seen) Kant takes\nHume\u2019s problem of causality to be centrally implicated in the\nradically new problem of synthetic a priori judgments. Yet the latter\nproblem, in turn, clearly has its origin in Kant\u2019s earlier\ndiscussion (in the essay on Negative Magnitudes and\nDreams of a Spirit-Seer) of the apparently mysterious\nconnection between a real ground (or cause) and its consequent (or\neffect). Just as Kant had earlier emphasized (in these pre-critical\nworks) that the consequent of a real ground is not contained in it,\nand thus does not result by \u201cthe analysis of concepts\u201d,\nKant now (in the critical period) maintains that the concept of the\neffect cannot be contained in the concept of the cause and,\naccordingly, that a judgment relating the two cannot be analytic. Such\na judgment, in Kant\u2019s critical terminology, must now be\nsynthetic\u2014it is a judgment in which \u201cthe connection of the\npredicate with the subject \u2026 is thought without\nidentity\u201d, where \n\n\na predicate is added to the concept of the subject which is by no\nmeans thought in it, and which could not have been extracted from it\nby any analysis. (A7/B10\u201311) \n\n\nThe crucial point about a synthetic a priori judgment,\nhowever, is that, although it is certainly not (as a priori) derived\nfrom experience, it nonetheless extends our knowledge beyond merely\nanalytic judgments.\n\nIt therefore becomes clear why, in the Introduction to the second\nedition of the Critique, Kant says of the crucial problem of\nsynthetic a priori judgments that \n\n\nthis problem, and perhaps even the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic judgments, was not thought of\nearlier, \n\n\nand then explicitly names \u201cDavid Hume, who, among all\nphilosophers, came closest to this problem\u201d (B19). It also\nbecomes clear why, in the Preface to the Prolegomena, Kant\nexplains Hume\u2019s problem as follows (4, 257; 7):\n\n\nHume proceeded primarily from a single but important concept of\nmetaphysics, namely, that of the connection of cause and\neffect \u2026 , and he challenged reason, which here pretends\nto have generated this concept in her womb, to give him an account of\nby what right she thinks that something could be so constituted that,\nif it is posited, something else must necessarily also be posited\nthereby; for this is what the concept of cause says. He proved\nindisputably that it is completely impossible for reason to think such\na connection a priori and from concepts [alone] (for this [connection]\ncontains necessity); but it can in no way be comprehended how, because\nsomething is, something else must necessarily also be, and how,\ntherefore, the concept of such a connection could be introduced a\npriori.\n\n\nThus here, in the Prolegomena, Kant describes what he calls\nHume\u2019s \u201cchallenge\u201d to reason concerning\n\u201cthe connection of cause and effect\u201d in precisely\nthe same terms that he had himself earlier used, in the 1763 essay on\nNegative Magnitudes and the 1766 Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer, to pose a fundamental problem about the relation of\na real ground (as opposed to a logical ground) to its consequent.\n\nWhat is most important, however, is the official solution to\nHume\u2019s problem that Kant presents in \u00a7 29 of the\nProlegomena. This solution depends on the distinction between\n\u201cjudgments of perception\u201d and \u201cjudgments of\nexperience\u201d which Kant has extensively discussed in the\npreceding sections. In \u00a7 18 Kant introduces the distinction as\nfollows (4, 298; 51):\n\n\nEmpirical judgments, in so far as they have objective\nvalidity, are judgments of experience; they,\nhowever, in so far as they are only subjectively valid, I\ncall mere judgments of perception. \u2026 All of\nour judgments are at first mere judgments of perception: they are\nvalid merely for us, i.e., for our subject, and only afterwards do we\ngive them a new relation, namely to an object, and we intend that [the\njudgment] is supposed to be also valid for us at all times and\nprecisely so for everyone else; for, if a judgment agrees with an\nobject, then all judgments about the same object must also agree among\none another, and thus the objective validity of the judgment of\nexperience signifies nothing else but its necessary universal\nvalidity.\n\n\nThen, in \u00a7 22, Kant emphasizes that the pure concepts of the\nunderstanding or categories function precisely to convert mere\n(subjective) perceptions into objective experience by effecting a\n\u201cnecessary unification\u201d of them (4, 305; 58):\n\n\n\nTherefore, the pure concepts of the understanding are those concepts\nunder which all perceptions must first be subsumed before they can\nserve as judgments of experience, in which the synthetic unity of\nperceptions is represented as necessary and universally\n valid.[3]\n\n\n\nHere is how Kant formulates his solution in \u00a7 29 (4, 312;\n65):\n\n\nIn order to make a trial with Hume\u2019s problematic\nconcept (his crux metaphysicorum), namely the\nconcept of cause, first, there is given to me a priori, by means of\nlogic, the form of a conditional judgment in general, namely, to use a\ngiven cognition as ground and the other as consequent. It is possible,\nhowever, that a rule of relation is found in perception which says\nthat a given appearance is constantly followed by another (but not\nconversely); and this is a case for me to employ the hypothetical\njudgment and, e.g., to say: if a body is illuminated sufficiently long\nby the sun, then it becomes warm. Here, there is certainly no\nnecessity of connection as yet, and thus [not] the concept of cause.\nHowever, I continue and say that, if the above proposition, which is\nmerely a subjective connection of perceptions, is to be a judgment of\nexperience, then it must be viewed as necessary and universally valid.\nBut such a proposition would be: the sun is through its light the\ncause of heat. The above empirical rule is now viewed as a\nlaw\u2014and, in fact, not as valid merely of appearances, but\n[valid] of them on behalf of a possible experience, which requires\ncompletely and thus necessarily valid rules.\n\n\nAll the elements from Kant\u2019s earlier discussion of causality in\nthe essays on Negative Magnitudes and Dreams of a\nSpirit-Seer seem to be present here. Kant begins with the purely\nlogical relation between ground and consequent. Since, in the case of\nthe concept of cause, we are dealing with what Kant had earlier called\na real ground, Kant holds that we need a synthetic rather\nthan merely analytic connection between the two. The most obvious\nthought, which Hume had defended in the Enquiry (and,\napparently following Hume, Kant himself had defended in Dreams of\na Spirit-Seer) is that \u201cexperience\u201d (in the Humean\nsense) is the basis for this connection in so far as one perception is\nfound to be \u201cconstantly conjoined\u201d with another. Now,\nhowever, in the critical period, Kant introduces a revolutionary new\nconcept of \u201cexperience\u201d which is explicitly opposed to\nmere constant conjunctions among perceptions in being \u201cnecessary\nand universally valid\u201d\u2014in particular, \u201cexperience is\npossible only by means of the representation of a necessary connection\nof perceptions\u201d (B218).\n\nIn Kant\u2019s example from \u00a7 29 of the Prolegomena,\nthen, we begin from a mere subjective \u201cempirical rule\u201d:\nthat the perception of an illuminated stone is constantly followed by\nthe perception of heat; and we then convert this \u201cempirical\nrule\u201d into an objective law according to which the very same\nrelationship is now viewed as \u201cnecessary and universally\nvalid\u201d. This transformation is effected by the addition of the a\npriori concept of causality: \u201cthe sun is through its light the\ncause of heat\u201d. It is in precisely this way, more generally,\nthat the categories or pure concepts of the understanding relate to\nexperience: \n\n\nnot in such a way that they are derived from experience, but that\nexperience is derived from them, a completely reversed kind of\nconnection which never occurred to Hume. (\u00a7 30: 4, 313; 66)\n\n\nWe shall devote the rest of this article to clarifying Kant\u2019s\nsolution and its relationship with Hume\u2019s conception of\ncausation. For now, we simply note an important difficulty Kant\nhimself raises in the Prolegomena. Whereas the concept of\ncausality is, for Kant, clearly a priori, he does not think that\nparticular causal laws relating specific causes with specific effects\nare all synthetic a priori\u2014and, if they are not a priori, how\ncan they be necessary? Indeed, Kant illustrates this difficulty, in a\nfootnote to \u00a7 22, with his own example of the sun warming a stone\n(4, 305; 58):\n\n\nBut how does this proposition, that judgments of experience are\nsupposed to contain necessity in the synthesis of perceptions, agree\nwith my proposition, urged many times above, that experience, as a\nposteriori cognition, can yield only contingent judgments? If I say\nthat experience teaches me something, I always mean only the\nperception that lies within in it, e.g., that heat always follows the\nillumination of the stone by the sun. That this heating results\nnecessarily from the illumination by the sun is in fact contained in\nthe judgment of experience (in virtue of the concept of cause); but I\ndo not learn this from experience, rather, conversely, experience is\nfirst generated through this addition of the concept of the\nunderstanding (of cause) to the perception.\n\n\nIn other words, experience in the Humean sense teaches me that heat\nalways (i.e., constantly) follows the illumination of the stone by the\nsun; experience in the Kantian sense then adds that: \n\n\nthe succession is necessary; \u2026 the effect does not\nmerely follow upon the cause but is posited through it and\nfollows from it. (A91/B124) \n\n\nBut what exactly does this mean?\n",
