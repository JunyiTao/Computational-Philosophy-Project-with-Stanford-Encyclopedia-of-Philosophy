    "main_text": "Art and Aesthetic Experience\n8. Art and Aesthetic Experience\n\nIn his magnum opus on aesthetics, Art as Experience\n(AE, LW10: 31) Dewey stated that art, as a conscious idea, is\n\u201cthe greatest intellectual achievement in the history of\nhumanity\u201d\n (31).[51]\n Such high praise, especially from a philosopher with expertise in\n(what remains) philosophy\u2019s \u201cmain\u201d subjects (e.g.,\nknowledge, ethics, science) deserves notice. Dewey began writing about\naesthetics from early in his career\u2014on art\u2019s relevance to psychology (1887, EW2) and education (1897c, EW5), on why the distinction between \n\n\u201cfine\u201d and \n\n\u201cpractical\u201d art should be rejected (1891, EW3: 310-311), and on Bosanquet (1893, EW4). His own theory emerged in\nExperience and Nature (1925a, EN, LW1) and\nflourished in AE (1934b), proposing that aesthetics is\ncentral to philosophy\u2019s proper mission: to render everyday\nexperience more fulfilling and meaningful.\n\nDewey\u2019s aesthetics has, arguably, four main objectives. First,\nit explicates art\u2019s ontology, the interrelated processes of\nmaking and appreciation, and specifies the functions of interpretation\nand\n criticism.[52]\n Second, it examines arts\u2019 social role in presenting,\nreimagining, and projecting human identity. Third, it analyzes the\ncommunicative functions of art, especially in education and political\nlife. Finally, it describes and analyzes the implications of\nart\u2019s expression as experience; such experience is so vivified\nand integrated as to be qualitatively distinct\u2014experience as\n \u201cconsummatory\u201d.[53]\n Consummatory experience happens occasionally; sometimes it occurs not\nin an \u201cartistic\u201d context (concert, museum, etc.) but in\nunexpectedly quotidian circumstances. Nevertheless, it is also life at\nits fullest. Determining how more of life\u2019s experiences\ncould become consummatory is the main purpose of Dewey\u2019s\naesthetics.\n\nThus, the main question AE poses is: How did a chasm arise\nbetween the arts, artists and ordinary people? How have cultural\nconditions and aesthetic theories (reinforced by institutions)\nisolated \u201cart and its appreciation by placing them in a realm of\ntheir own, disconnected from other modes of experiencing\u201d?\n(AE, LW10: 16) AE makes explicit art\u2019s natural\ncontinuities with everyday life, while seeking to prevent its\nreduction to mere entertainment or \u201ctransient pleasurable\n excitations\u201d[54]\n (AE, LW10: 16). Dewey criticizes traditional\naesthetics\u2019 spectatorial (or theoretical) starting point and\ngoes on to offer radically empirical accounts of art making,\nappreciation, expression, form, and criticism. Because aesthetic\nexperience has organic roots, it can be recognized even in everyday\nobjects and\n events.[55]\n Again, the goal is to dissolve the dualisms between\n\u201cfine\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d objects and to help\nestablish a greater \u201ccontinuity of esthetic experience with\nnormal processes of living\u201d (AE, LW10: 16).\n\nFor further details on Dewey\u2019s aesthetics, see entry on\n Dewey\u2019s aesthetics\n by T. Leddy (2016).\n",
