Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s\nbook is in the spirit of RUSS, rather than BISH; indeed, its author\ndid not have access to Bishop\u2019s book until his own manuscript\nwas finished. Martin-L\u00f6f later turned his attention to his theory\nof types as a foundation for Bishop-style constructive mathematics.\n\n\nHere, in his own words, is an informal explanation of the ideas\nunderlying ML:\n\nWe shall think of mathematical objects or\nconstructions. Every mathematical object is of a certain kind\nor type [\u2026 and] is always given together with its\ntype. \u2026 A type is defined by describing what we have to do in\norder to construct an object of that type. \u2026 Put differently, a\ntype is well-defined if we understand \u2026 what it means to be an\nobject of that type. Thus, for instance \\(\\bN \\rightarrow \\bN\\)\n[functions from \\(\\bN\\) to \\(\\bN\\)] is a type, not because we know\nparticular number theoretic functions like the primitive recursive\nones, but because we think we understand the notion of number\ntheoretic function in general. (Martin-L\u00f6f [975])\n\n\nIn particular, in this system every proposition can be represented as\na type: namely, the type of proofs of the proposition. Conversely,\neach type determines a proposition: namely, the proposition that the\ntype in question is inhabited. So when we think of a certain type\n\\(T\\) as a proposition, we interpret the formula  \n\\[\nx \\in T\n\\]\n\n\nas \u201c\\(x\\) is a proof of the proposition \\(T\\)\u201d. \n\nMartin-L\u00f6f goes on to construct new types, such as Cartesian\nproducts and disjoint unions, from old. For example, the Cartesian\nproduct \n\\[\n(\\Pi x \\in A) B(x)\n\\]\n\n\nis the type of functions that take an arbitrary object \\(x\\) of type\n\\(A\\) into an object of type \\(B(x)\\). In the propositions-as-proofs\ninterpretation, where \\(B(x)\\) represents a proposition, the above\nCartesian product corresponds to the universal proposition\n\n\\[\n(\\forall x \\in A) B(x).\n\\]\n\n\nMartin-L\u00f6f distinguishes carefully between proofs and\nderivations: a proof object is a witness to the fact that\nsome proposition has been proved; whereas a derivation is the\nrecord of the construction of a proof object. Also, he exercises two\nbasic forms (one dare not say \u201ctypes\u201d here) of\njudgement. The first is a relation between proof objects and\npropositions, the second a property of some propositions. In the first\ncase, the judgement is either one that a proof object \\(a\\) is a\nwitness to a proposition \\(A\\), or else one that two proof objects\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are equal and both witness that \\(A\\) has been proved.\nThe first case of the second form of judgement states that a\nproposition \\(A\\) is well-formed, and the second records that two\npropositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal.\n\nThere is a careful, and highly detailed, set of rules for formalising\nML. We will not go into those here, but refer the reader to other\nsources such as Sambin & Smith [1998].\n\nWhen actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory, one often\nneeds to equip completely presented sets (types) with an equivalence\nrelation, the combination being known as a setoid. Mappings\nare then functions that respect those equivalence relations. This is\nin close agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory\nof sets. The dependent types of Martin-L\u00f6f are useful for\nconstructing subsets. For instance, the real numbers can be\nconstructed using the \\(\\Sigma\\)-type (see Martin-L\u00f6f\n[1984]): \n\\[\n(\\Sigma x \\in \\bN_+\\rightarrow \\bQ)(\\Pi m \\in \\bN_+)(\\Pi n \\in \\bN_+)\\left[\\abs{x_{m} - x_{n}} \\le \\left(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\right],\n\\]\n\n\nAn element of this type \\(B\\) is thereby a pair consisting of a\nconvergent sequence \\(\\bx\\) of rationals and a proof \\(p\\) that it is\nconvergent. A suitable equivalence relation \\({\\sim}\\) on \\(R\\) is\ndefined by taking \\((x,p)\\sim(y,q)\\) to mean \n\\[\n\\forall m \\in \\bN_+ \\left(\\abs{x_{m} - y_{m}} \\le  \\frac{2}{m}\\right).\n\\]\n\n\nThe resulting setoid of real numbers is \\(\\bR = (R,{\\sim})\\).\nWe can readily prove that \n\\[\n\\forall x \\in \\bR\\, \\exists n \\in Z (n \\lt x \\lt n+2)\n\\]\n\n\nand then, using the type-theoretic axiom of choice (see Section 4\nbelow), find a function \\(f : \\bR\\rightarrow \\bZ\\) such that \\(f(x)\n\\lt x \\lt f(x)+2\\). However, there is no reason to believe that the\nfunction \\(f\\) respects the equivalence relations\u2014that is, that\n\\(f(x) = f(y)\\) holds if \\(x \\sim y\\).\n\nEvery constructive proof embodies an algorithm that, in principle, can\nbe extracted and recast as a computer program; moreover, the\nconstructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is\ncorrect \u2014 that is, meets its specification. One major advantage\nof Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s formal approach to constructive mathematics\nis that it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs.\nThis has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive\nmathematics in various locations (see Martin-L\u00f6f [1980],\nConstable [1986], Hayashi & Nakano [1988], Schwichtenberg [2009]).\nSome recent implementations of type theory for proof extraction are\nCoq and Agda (see the links in Other Internet Resources).\n4. Axioms of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis\n\nThe full axiom of choice can be stated as follows:\n\n\nIf \\(A,B\\) are inhabited sets, and \\(S\\) a subset of \\(A \\times B\\)\nsuch that \n\\[\n\\forall x\\in A\\,\\exists y\\in B((x,y) \\in S),\n\\]\n\n\nthen there exists a choice function \\(f : A \\rightarrow B\\)\nsuch that  \n\\[\n\\forall x\\in A  ((x,f(x)) \\in S).\n\\]\n\n\n\nNow, if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation, then for\na given \\(x \\in A\\), the value \\(f(x)\\) of the choice function will\ndepend not only on \\(x\\) but also on the data proving that \\(x\\)\nbelongs to \\(A.\\) In general, we cannot expect to produce a\nchoice function of this sort. However, the BHK interpretation of the\nhypotheses in the axiom is that there is an algorithm \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\nwhich, applied to any given \\(x \\in A\\), produces an element \\(y \\in\nB\\) such that \\((x,y) \\in S\\). If \\(A\\) is a completely presented\nset, one for which no work beyond the construction of each\nelement in the set is required to prove that the element does indeed\nbelong to \\(A\\), then we might reasonably expect the algorithm\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) to be a choice function. In Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s\ntype theory, every set is completely presented and, in\nkeeping with the BHK interpretation, the axiom of choice is\nderivable.\n\nOn the other hand, in Bishop-style mathematics, completely\npresented\u2013\u2013\u2013or, in his terminology,\nbasic\u2013\u2013\u2013sets are rare, one example being\n\\(\\bN\\); so we might expect that the axiom of choice would not be\nderivable. In fact, as was shown by Diaconescu [1975] and Goodman\n& Myhill [1978], and prefigured by Bishop himself in Problem 2 on\npage 58 of Bishop 1967, the axiom of choice implies the law of\nexcluded middle. Clearly, the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem\napplies only under the assumption that not every set is completely\npresented.\n\nConstructive mathematicians not working in ML typically reject the\nfull axiom of choice but embrace the axiom of countable choice, in\nwhich the domain of choice is \\(\\bN\\), and dependent choice. But some\nprefer to work without even countable choice, on the grounds that to\nspeak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule presents a\ndifficulty that is just as great whether or not the infinity is\ndenumerable. Interestingly, Lebesgue made precisely this point in a\nletter to Borel (see Moore [2013], page 316): \n\nI agree completely with Hadamard when he states that to speak of an\ninfinity of choices without giving a rule presents a difficulty that\nis just as great whether or not the infinity is denumerable.\n\n\nThe effect of abandoning even countable choice is the exclusion of\nmany theorems that, as they stand, are proved using sequential,\nchoice-based arguments. But those who advocate avoiding choice would\nargue that avoiding choice forces you to formulate things better.\n\nA particular case of interest is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:\nevery complex polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane.\nRichman [2000] has shown that without countable choice, although we\ncan construct only isolated (possibly multiple) roots, we can\nconstruct arbitrarily close approximations to the multiset of roots.\nSuch an approach focusses on finding an approximate linear\nfactorization of the polynomial, rather than on finding separate\napproximations to each of its roots.\n\nFor further analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type\ntheory see Martin-L\u00f6f [2006], and the SEP entries on\n category theory,\n type theory, and\n intuitionistic type theory.\n\nWe now recall the power set axiom of classical set theory: if\n\\(X\\) is a set, then so is its power set \n\\[\n\\textrm{sb}(X)\u2261 \\{S: S \\subset X\\}.\n\\]\n Since\nthis definition is impredicative, most constructive mathematicians\nhesitate to regard \\(\\textrm{sb}(X)\\) as a set. What they normally\nuse, and we shall adopt, as the constructive replacement for the power\nset axiom is the axiom of exponentiation : If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare sets, then so is the set of all mappings from \\(A\\) into \\(B\\). In\nparticular, the class \\(2^{\\bN}\\) of all binary sequences is a set.\n\n\nIn order to discuss the Continuum Hypothesis, we need notions of\ncomparative size for classes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). We say that\n\n \\(A\\) is equinumerous with  \\(B\\) if there exists a\nbijective mapping of \\(A\\) onto \\(B\\), and that \n \\(A\\) is cardinally included in  \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) is\nequinumerous with a subclass of \\(B\\).\n In the first case we write \\(A\\) \u2245 \\(B\\), and in the\nsecond, \\(A \u2272 B\\). \n\n\nA consequence of the axiom of replacement in constructive\nZermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory,\n CZF,\n is that if \\(A\\) is a set and \\(B\\) is a class that is equinumerous\nwith \\(A\\), then \\(B\\) is also a set. It follows that the class\n\n\\[\n\\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\u2261 \\{S \\subset\\bN : \\forall x \\in \\bN (x \\in S \\vee x \\not\\in S)\\}\n\\]\n of detachable subsets of \\(\\bN\\), being equivalent to\n\\(2^{\\bN}\\), is a set. \n\nClassically, every subset of \\(\\bN\\) is detachable from \\(\\bN\\), so\n\\(\\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\) = \\(\\textrm{sb}(\\bN)\\). But this is not the case\nconstructively: if for each statement \\(p\\) the set \n\\[\n\\{x \\in 1 : p \\vee \\neg p \\}\n\\]\n were\nin \\(\\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\), then we could derive the law of excluded\nmiddle. \n\nThe classical Continuum Hypothesis states that there is no\nset whose cardinality lies strictly between that of the set \\(\\bN\\)\nand that of \\(\\textrm{sb}(\\bN)\\). We can state this more formally as\nfollows: \n\\[\n\\forall C(\\bN \u2272 C\u2272 \\textrm{sb}(\\bN) \\Rightarrow C \\cong \\bN \\vee C \\cong \\textrm{sb}(\\bN))\n\\]\n or, equivalently, \n\\[\n\\forall C(\\bN \u2272 C\u2272 \\textrm{sb}(\\bN) \\wedge \\neg(C \u2272  \\bN) \\Rightarrow C \\cong \\textrm{sb}(\\bN))\n\\]\n Constructively\nacceptable classical equivalents of these two statements are:\n\n\\[\n\\forall C(\\bN \u2272 C \u2272 \\textrm{dch}(\\bN) \\Rightarrow C \\cong \\bN \\vee C \\cong \\textrm{dch}(\\bN))\n\\]\n and the one that we take as our constructive\nContinuum Hypothesis, \\(\\textrm{CH}\\), \n\\[\n\\forall C(\\bN \u2272 C\u2272 \\textrm{dch}(\\bN) \\wedge \\neg(C \\cong \\bN) \\Rightarrow C \\cong \\textrm{dch}(\\bN))\n\\]\n\nWe sketch a proof that \\(\\textrm{CH}\\) implies the law of excluded\nmiddle. First we note that \\(2^{\\bN}\\) is uncountable in the strong\nsense: Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument shows that if \\(S\\) is a countable\nsubset of \\(2^{\\bN}\\), then there exists \\(f \\in 2^{\\bN}\\) such that\n\\(f \\notin S\\). Assuming \\(\\textrm{CH}\\), we now define \n\\[\nX\u2261 \\{S \\in \\textrm{dch}(\\bN) : p \\vee \\neg p \\}\\]\n\nand \n\\[\n\\textrm{C}\u2261\\bN \\cup X.\n\\]\n Then \\(\\bN \u2272C\u2272\\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\). If \\(C\n\\cong \\bN \\), then \\(p \\vee \\neg p \\) is false, which is absurd. Hence\n\\(\\neg (C \\cong \\bN)\\) and therefore \\(C \\cong \\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\).\nBut \\(\\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\), being equinumerous with \\(2^{\\bN}\\) , is\nuncountable, so there exists \\(S \\in \\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\) that does not\nbelong to the countable subset \\(\\bN\\) of \\(\\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\). Thus\n\\(S \\in C \\), and therefore \\(p \\vee \\neg p \\) holds.\n\nIncidentally, although, in light of the BHK interpretation of\n'\\(\\vee\\)', the first of our two constructive statements classically\nequivalent to the classical Continuum Hypothesis might appear to be\nstronger than \\(\\textrm{CH}\\), since the latter implies the law of\nexcluded middle it is constructively equivalent to the former.\n\nThe foregoing work on \\(\\textrm{CH}\\) can be formalised in\n CZF,\n which is equiconsistent with classical Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set\ntheory,\n ZF.\n If we allow ourselves to invoke the G\u00f6del\u2013Cohen theorem\nthat the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of ZF, then we can draw\nsome interesting conclusions by looking more closely at our proof that\n\\(\\textrm{CH}\\) implies LEM. To do so, take \\(p=\\textrm{CH}\\) in our\nproof, so that \n\\[\nX\u2261 \\{S \\in \\textrm{dch}(\\bN) : \\textrm {CH} \\vee \\neg \\textrm{CH} \\}.\n\\]\n If \\(X=0\\), then \\(\\neg (\\textrm{CH} \\vee\n\\neg \\textrm{CH})\\), which is absurd; so \\(\\neg(X=0)\\). On the other\nhand, if \\(X\\) is inhabited \u2014 that is, contains a point \u2014\nthen \\(\\textrm{CH} \\vee \\neg \\textrm{CH}\\), so under the constructive\ninterpretation of '\\(\\vee\\)', either we have a proof of\n\\(\\textrm{CH}\\) or else we have a proof of \\(\\neg \\textrm{CH}\\). Since\nthis runs counter to the aforementioned G\u00f6del\u2013Cohen\ntheorem, we may regard \\(X\\) as an explicit example of a set that is\nnot empty but for which it is impossible to construct a member. This,\nin itself, is not uninteresting; but it also gives a new insight into\nthe constructive status of \\(\\textrm{CH}\\). From our proof that\n\\(\\textrm{CH}\\) implies LEM we see that the set \\(C\u2261\\bN \\cup X\\)\nsatisfies \n\\[\n    \\bN\u2272C\u2272\\textrm{dch}(\\bN) \\wedge \\neg(C \\cong \\bN).\n    \\]\n Also, \n\\[\n    \\neg(C \\cong \\textrm{dch}(\\bN)) \\Rightarrow X=0,\n    \\]\n which is absurd, so\n\\(\\neg\\neg(C \\cong \\textrm{dch}(\\bN))\\). On the other hand,\n\n\\[\nC \\cong \\textrm{dch}(\\bN) \\Rightarrow \\textrm{CH} \\vee \\neg \\textrm{CH}.\n\\]\n Thus, provided \\(\\textrm{CH}\\) is independent of CZF\n(which, in view of equiconsistency of CZF and ZF, it had better be),\nwe see that \\(C\\) is an explicit example of a set that has the\nproperty \n\\[\n    \\bN\u2272C\u2272\\textrm{dch}(\\bN) \\wedge \\neg(C\\cong \\bN) \\wedge \\neg \\neg (C \\cong \\textrm{dch}(\\bN))\n    \\]\n but, within CZF, cannot be proved equinumerous\nwith \\(\\textrm{dch}(\\bN)\\). \n5. Constructive Reverse Mathematics\n\nIn the 1970s, Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of\nreverse mathematics, aiming to classify mathematical theorems\naccording to their equivalence to one of a small number of\nset-theoretic principles (Friedman 1975). This classification reveals\ninteresting, sometimes remarkable, differences in proof-theoretic\ncomplexity. For example, although the Ascoli\u2013Arzel\u00e0\ntheorem is used in the standard proof of Peano\u2019s existence\ntheorem for solutions of ordinary differential equations (Hurewicz\n[1958], page 10), a reverse-mathematical analysis shows that the\nformer is equivalent to a strictly stronger set-theoretic principle\nthan the one equivalent to Peano\u2019s theorem (Simpson [1984],\nTheorems 3.9 and 4.2). The standard treatise on classical reverse\nmathematics is (Simpson [1999/2009]). \n\nAround the turn of this century, Veldman (see Other Internet\nResources), in the Netherlands, and Ishihara [2005, 2006], in Japan,\nindependently initiated a programme of constructive reverse\nmathematics (CRM), based on intuitionistic, rather than\nclassical, logic. (Note, though, that the first published work in the\nmodern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [1984], which\nwas twenty years ahead of its time.) In this section of the article,\nwe describe a less formal approach to CRM, in the style and framework\nof BISH. The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in\nthe three standard models\u2014CLASS, INT, and RUSS\u2014according\nto which principles we must, and need only, add to BISH in order to\nprove them. \n\nWe stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal CRM, in\nwhich we take for granted the principles of function- and\nset-construction described in the first chapters of Bishop [1967] or\nBishop & Bridges [1985], and we work in the informal, though\nrigorous, style of the practising analyst, algebraist, topologist,\n\u2026 . \n\nIn practice, CRM splits naturally into two parts. In the first of\nthese, we consider a theorem \\(T\\) of INT or RUSS, and try to find\nsome principle, valid in that model and other than \\(T\\) itself, whose\naddition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a constructive proof\nof \\(T\\). In the second part of CRM we deal with a theorem \\(T\\) of\nCLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive, and we try to prove that\n\\(T\\) is equivalent, over BISH, to one of a number of known\nessentially-nonconstructive principles, such as MP, LLPO, LPO, or LEM.\nFor an example of this part of CRM, we mention our earlier proof that\nthe classical least-upper-bound principle implies, and hence is\nequivalent to, LEM. \n\nIncidentally, there is a strong argument for Brouwer [1921] being the\nfirst to deal with reverse-mathematical ideas: his Brouwerian\ncounterexamples (see the one using the Goldbach conjecture, in Section\n1 above) lie squarely in the second part of CRM. Even if Brouwer did\nnot state those examples as logical equivalences, but as implications\nof the type \n\\[\nP \\Rightarrow \\text{ some nonconstructive principle},\n\\]\n\n\nit is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right-hand-side\nimplied the left in such cases.\n5.1 Fan theorems in CRM\n\nTo illustrate the first part of CRM, we now concentrate on theorems of\nthe type \n\\[\n\\text{BISH } \\vdash \\text{ FT}_? \\Leftrightarrow T,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere FT\\(_?\\) is some form of Brouwer\u2019s fan theorem, and \\(T\\)\nis a theorem of INT. To do so, we need to distinguish between certain\ntypes of bar for the complete binary fan \\(2^*\\) (the set of\nall finite sequences in \\(\\{0,1\\})\\). \n\nLet \\(\\alpha \\equiv (\\alpha_1 ,\\alpha_2, \\ldots)\\) be a finite or\ninfinite binary sequence. The concatenation of \\(\\alpha\\)\nwith another string \\(\\beta\\) is \n\\[\n\\alpha^{\\frown}\\beta \\equiv \n(\\alpha_1 ,\\alpha_2 ,\\ldots ,\\alpha_n ,\\beta_1 ,\\ldots ,\\beta_m).\n\\]\n\n\nFor \\(b\\) in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) we write \\(\\alpha^{\\frown}b\\) rather than\n\\(\\alpha^{\\frown}(b)\\). By a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset of \\(2^*\\)\nwe mean a subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) such that \n\\[\\tag{1}\nB = \\{u \\in 2^* : \\forall v\\in 2^* (u^{\\frown}v \\in D)\\}\n\\]\n\n\nfor some detachable subset \\(D\\) of \\(2^*\\). Every detachable subset\nof \\(2^*\\) is a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset. On the other hand, by a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset of \\(2^*\\) we mean a subset \\(B\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) with the following property: there exists a detachable subset\n\\(S\\) of \\(2^* \\times \\bN\\) such that \n\\[\n\\forall u\\in 2^*\\,\\forall n\\in \\bN\\,\n ((u,n) \\in S \\Rightarrow (u^{\\frown}0,n) \\in S \\wedge \n  (u^{\\frown}1,n) \\in S)\n\\]\n\n\nand  \n\\[\nB = \\{u \\in 2^* :\\forall n\\in \\bN((u,n) \\in S)\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nEvery \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) is a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset: simply take \\(S = D \\times \\bN\\), where \\(D\\) is\na detachable subset of \\(2^*\\) such that (1) holds. \n\nIf \\(?\\) denotes a property of subsets of \\(2^*\\), then\nBrouwer\u2019s fan theorem for \\(?\\)-bars tells us\nthat every bar with the property \\(?\\) is a uniform bar. We are\nparticularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable bars\n(already discussed in Section 3.1):\n\nFT\\(_D\\): Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;\n\n\nthe fan theorem for \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subsets):\n\nFT\\(_{\\mathsf{c}}\\): Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is\nuniform; \n\nthe fan theorem for \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subsets):\n\nFT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1}\\): Every \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bar of the complete binary fan\nis uniform; \n\nand the full fan theorem: \n\nFT: Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform. \n\nNote that, relative to BISH, \n\nFT \\(\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c \\Rightarrow\\)\nFT\\(_D\\). \n\nLubarsky and Diener [2014] have shown that these implications are\nstrict. \n\nTypically, we want to prove that FT\\(_?\\) is equivalent, over BISH, to\nthe proposition that, for every set \\(S\\) of an appropriate sort, some\npointwise property of the form \n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\forall x \\in S \\exists t \\in T P(s,t)\n\\]\n\n\nactually holds uniformly in the form \n\\[\\tag{3}\n\\exists t \\in T \\forall s \\in S P(s,t).\n\\]\n\n\nOur strategy for attacking this problem is two-fold. First, given a\nset \\(S\\) of the appropriate sort, we construct a ?-subset \\(N\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) such that \n\nif (2) holds, then \\(B\\) is a bar, and\nif \\(B\\) is a uniform bar, then (3) holds.\n\n\nThis, though, is only half of the solution. To prove that the\nimplication from (3) to (2) implies FT\\(_?\\), we consider a ?-subset\n\\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) and construct a corresponding set \\(S\\) such that\n\n\nif \\(B\\) is a bar, then (2) holds, and\nif (3) holds, then \\(B\\) is a uniform bar.\n\n\nThe canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman\n[1984], in which \\(S\\) is the set of values of a given uniformly\ncontinuous mapping \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR, T\\) is the set of\npositive real numbers, and \n\\[\nP(s,t) \\equiv (s \\ge t).\n\\]\n\n\nThe pointwise property we consider is \n\\[\n\\forall x \\in [0,1] \\exists t \\gt 0 (f(x) \\ge t),\n\\]\n\n\nits uniform version being \n\\[\n\\exists t \\gt 0 \\forall x \\in [0,1] (f(x) \\ge t).\n\\]\n\n\nThe Julian-Richman results are as follows. \n\n\nTheorem 1: Let \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR\\) be\nuniformly continuous. Then there exists a detachable subset \\(B\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) such that\n\nif \\(f(x) \\gt 0\\) for each \\(x \\in [0,1]\\), then \\(B\\) is a bar,\nand \nif \\(B\\) is a uniform bar, then \\(\\inf f \\gt 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2: Let \\(B\\) be a detachable subset of\n\\(2^*\\). Then there exists a uniformly continuous \\(f : [0,1]\n\\rightarrow \\bR\\) such that\n\nif \\(B\\) is a bar, then \\(f(x) \\gt 0\\) for each \\(x \\in [0,1]\\),\nand\nif inf \\(f \\gt 0\\), then \\(B\\) is a uniform bar.\n\n\n\nThe proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky; see Julian\n& Richman [1984].\n\nThe two Julian-Richman theorems together reveal that, relative to\nBISH, the fan theorem FT\\(_D\\) is equivalent to the positivity\nprinciple, POS: \n\nEach positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \\([0,1]\\) has a\npositive infimum. \n\nIt follows that POS is derivable in INT, in which the full fan\ntheorem, not just FT\\(_D\\), is a standard principle. The situation is\nquiet the opposite in RUSS, where there exist both a detachable bar of\n\\(2^*\\) that is not uniform and a positive-valued, uniformly\ncontinuous function on \\([0,1]\\) that has infimum equal to 0; see\nChapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman [1987]. \n\nBerger and Ishihara [2005] have taken a different, indirect route to\nestablishing the equivalence of POS and FT\\(_c\\). They establish a\nchain of equivalences between POS, FT\\(_c\\), and four principles of\nthe type \u201cif there is at most one object with property \\(P\\),\nthen there is one such object\u201d. The four unique-existence\nprinciples are:\n\n\nCIN!:   Each descending sequence of inhabited\nclosed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one\ncommon point has inhabited intersection (Cantor\u2019s intersection\ntheorem with uniqueness.) Note that a subset \\(S\\) of a metric space\n\\((X,\\rho)\\) is located if for each \\(x\\) in \\(X\\) the\ninfimum distance from \\(x\\) to \\(S\\) exists. \n\nMIN!:   Each uniformly continuous, real-valued\nfunction on a compact metric space with at most one minimum point has\na minimum point.\n\nWKL!  Each infinite tree with at most one\ninfinite branch has an infinite branch (the weak K\u00f6nig lemma with\nuniqueness).\n\nFIX!:  Each uniformly continuous function from\na compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point and\nwith approximate fixed points has a fixed point.\n\n\nIn, for example, the last of these, we say that a map \\(f\\) of a\nmetric space \\((X,\\varrho)\\) into itself\n\nhas at most one fixed point if \\(\\varrho(f(x),x) +\n\\varrho(f(y),y) \\gt 0\\) whenever \\(\\varrho(x,y) \\gt 0\\); \nhas approximate fixed points if for each \\(\\varepsilon\n\\gt 0\\) there exists \\(x \\in X\\) such that \\(\\varrho(f(x),x) \\lt\n\\varepsilon\\). \n\n\nA major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan\ntheorem that is equivalent, over BISH, to the uniform continuity\ntheorem for \\([0,1]\\),\n\nUCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\): Every pointwise continuous mapping of\n\\([0,1]\\) into \\(\\bR\\) is uniformly continuous, \n\nthe proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of\nthe fan theorem. (Note that UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\) is equivalent, relative to\nBISH, to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric spaces:\nEvery pointwise continuous mapping of a complete, totally bounded\nmetric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous. See, for\nexample, Loeb [2005].)\n\nIt follows from results of Berger [2006] that \n\nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c\\). \n\nAlso, Diener and Loeb (2008) have proved that\n\nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\). \n\nHowever, we do not know if either of these implications can be\nreplaced by a bi-implication. Perhaps UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\), and hence the\nfull uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces, is\nequivalent, relative to BISH, to some natural, but as yet\nunidentified, version of the fan theorem. \n\nFor additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse\nmathematics, see, for example, Berger & Bridges [2007]; Diener\n[2008, 2012]; Diener & Loeb [2009]; and Diener & Lubarsky\n[2014]. In Dent [2013], there is a clear, though complex, diagram\nillustrating the interconnections between fan theorems, continuity,\nand omniscience principles (see Other Internet Resources). \n\nInterested readers may pursue the topic of constructive reverse\nmathematics in greater detail in the following supplementary\ndocument:\n\nIshihara\u2019s principle \\(\\BDN\\) and the anti-Specker Property\n\n6. Constructive Algebra and Topology\n\nConstructive mathematicians initially concentrated their efforts on\nthe field of analysis, with considerable success\u2014witness the\nwealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop [1967]. This does\nnot mean that, for example, algebra has been sidelined from the\nconstructive enterprise: the material in the monograph by Mines et\nal [1986] can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart\nto the constructive analysis carried out by Bishop. Much more\nrecently, Lombardi and Quitt\u00e9 [2011] have published the first\nlarge volume of a proposed two-volume work on constructive algebra.\nHowever, not being expert in algebra, and being aware of the danger of\nmaking this article too long to hold the reader\u2019s attention, we\nchoose not to discuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail;\nrather, in the following supplementary document, we turn to\nconstructive topology, describing some rather different approaches to\nthat subject:\n\nApproaches to Constructive Topology\n\n7. Constructive Mathematical Economics and Finance\n\nInvestigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to a\nseries of papers on preference, utility, and demand from 1982 onwards;\nsee Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral thesis, Hendtlass [2013]\nsubstantially weakened the conditions for the existence of a demand\nfunction; he also produced a wealth of results in fixed-point theory\nand its applications, in particular to constructivisations of two\nclassical proofs of the existence of an economic equilibrium.\n\nIn 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on constructive\nmathematical finance, at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in\nMunich.They first showed that the fundamental theorem on asset\npricing, the separating hyperplane theorem, and Markov\u2019s\nPrinciple are constructively equivalent (Berger & Svindland\n[2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how to circumvent\nthe nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value theorem in order\nto prove the existence of extreme points for functions in the presence\nof even relatively weak convexity properties (Berger & Svindland\n[2016a]). Their project suggests that mathematical finance, like\nmathematical economics, may be a rich source of elegant, practical\nconstructive theorems.\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the\nconstructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical\nlogic; in order to avoid decisions, such as whether or not a real\nnumber equals 0, that cannot be made by a real computer, the\nmathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries\nsuch as those formed by recursive function theory. In contrast, the\nroute taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic\nlogic, which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible\ndecisions. This logic (together with an appropriate set- or\ntype-theoretic framework) suffices to keep the mathematics within\nconstructive boundaries. Thus the mathematician is free to work in the\nnatural style of an analyst, algebraist (e.g., Mines et al.\n[1988]), geometer, topologist (e.g., Bridges &\nV\u00ee\u021b\u0103 [2011], Sambin forthcoming), or other normal\nmathematician, the only constraints being those imposed by\nintuitionistic logic. As Bishop and others have shown, the traditional\nbelief promulgated by Hilbert and still widely held today, that\nintuitionistic logic imposes such restrictions as to render the\ndevelopment of serious mathematics impossible, is patently false:\nlarge parts of deep modern mathematics can be, and have been, produced\nby purely constructive methods. Moreover, the link between\nconstructive mathematics and programming holds great promise for the\nfuture implementation and development of abstract mathematics on the\ncomputer.\n\nFor further information about the state of modern constructive\nmathematics, we recommend the forthcoming Handbook of Constructive\nMathematics [Bridges et al., eds, 2023].",
