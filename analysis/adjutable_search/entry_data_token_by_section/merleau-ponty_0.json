    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nMerleau-Ponty was born in Rochefort-sur-Mer, in the province of\nCharente-Maritime, on March 14,\n 1908.[1]\n After the death in 1913 of his father, a colonial artillery captain\nand a knight of the Legion of Honor, he moved with his family to\nParis. He would later describe his childhood as incomparably happy,\nand he remained very close to his mother until her death in 1953.\nMerleau-Ponty pursued secondary studies at the Parisian lycees\nJanson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand, completing his first course in\nphilosophy at Janson-de-Sailly with Gustave Rodrigues in\n1923\u201324. He won the school\u2019s \u201cAward for Outstanding\nAchievement\u201d in philosophy that year and would later trace his\ncommitment to the vocation of philosophy to this first course. He was\nalso awarded \u201cFirst Prize in Philosophy\u201d at Louis-le-Grand\nin 1924\u201325. He attended the \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure from 1926 to 1930, where he befriended Simone de\nBeauvoir and Claude\n L\u00e9vi-Straus.[2]\n Some evidence suggests that, during these years, Merleau-Ponty\nauthored a novel, Nord. R\u00e9cit de l\u2019arctique,\nunder the pseudonym Jacques Heller (Alloa 2013b). His professors at\nENS included L\u00e9on Brunschvicg and \u00c9mile Br\u00e9hier,\nthe latter supervising his research on Plotinus for the Dipl\u00f4me\nd\u2019\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures in 1929. Br\u00e9hier would\ncontinue to supervise Merleau-Ponty\u2019s research through the\ncompletion of his two doctoral dissertations in 1945. During his\nstudent years, Merleau-Ponty attended Husserl\u2019s 1929 Sorbonne\nlectures and Georges Gurvitch\u2019s 1928\u20131930 courses on\nGerman philosophy. He received the agr\u00e9gation in\nphilosophy in 1930, ranking in second place.\n\nAfter a year of mandatory military service, Merleau-Ponty taught at\nthe lycee in Beauvais from 1931 to 1933, pursued a year of research on\nperception funded by a subvention from the Caisse nationale des\nsciences (the precursor of today\u2019s Centre national de la\nrecherche scientifique) in 1933\u201334, and taught at the lycee in\nChartres in 1934\u201335. From 1935 to 1940, he was a tutor\n(ag\u00e9g\u00e9-r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur) at the\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where his primary duty was to\nprepare students for the agr\u00e9gation. During this\nperiod, he attended Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve\u2019s lectures on Hegel\nand Aron Gurwitsch\u2019s lectures on Gestalt psychology. His first\npublications also appeared during these years, as a series of review\nessays on Max Scheler\u2019s Ressentiment (1935), Gabriel\nMarcel\u2019s Being and Having (1936), and Sartre\u2019s\nImagination\n (1936).[3]\n In 1938, he completed his th\u00e8se\ncompl\u00e9mentaire, originally titled Conscience et\ncomportement [Consciousness and Behavior] and published\nin 1942 as La structure du comportement [The Structure of\nBehavior, SC]. He was the first outside visitor to the newly\nestablished Husserl Archives in Louvain, Belgium, in April 1939, where\nhe met Eugen Fink and consulted Husserl\u2019s unpublished\nmanuscripts, including Ideen II and later sections of Die\nKrisis.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War Two, Merleau-Ponty served for a year as\nlieutenant in the 5th Infantry Regiment and 59th\nLight Infantry Division, until he was wounded in battle in June 1940,\ndays before the signing of the armistice between France and Germany.\nHe was awarded the Croix de guerre, recognizing bravery in\ncombat. After several months of convalescence, he returned to teaching\nat the Lyc\u00e9e Carnot in Paris, where he remained from 1940 until\n1944. In November 1940, he married Suzanne Jolibois, and their\ndaughter Marianne was born in June 1941. In the winter of\n1940\u201341, Merleau-Ponty renewed his acquaintance with Jean-Paul\nSartre, whom he had met as a student at the \u00c9cole Normale,\nthrough their involvement in the resistance group Socialisme et\nLibert\u00e9. The group published around ten issues of an\nunderground review until the arrest of two members in early 1942 led\nto its dissolution. After the conclusion of the war, in 1945,\nMerleau-Ponty would collaborate with Sartre and Beauvoir to found\nLes Temps Modernes, a journal devoted to\n\u201clitt\u00e9rature engag\u00e9e\u201d, for which he served\nas political editor until 1952.\n\nAt the end of the 1943\u201344 school year, Merleau-Ponty completed\nhis main thesis, Ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie de la\nperception [Phenomenology of Perception, PP], and in\n1944\u201345 he taught at the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet in Paris,\nreplacing Sartre during the latter\u2019s leave from this position.\nMerleau-Ponty defended his two dissertations in July 1945, fulfilling\nthe requirements for the Docteur \u00e8s lettres, which was\nawarded \u201cwith distinction\u201d. In October 1945, Les Temps\nModernes published its inaugural issue; Merleau-Ponty was a\nfounding member of the journal\u2019s governing board, managed its\ndaily affairs, and penned many of its editorials that were signed\nsimply \u201cT.M.\u201d, even though he refused to allow his name to\nbe printed on the cover alongside Sartre\u2019s as the review\u2019s\nDirector. That fall, Merleau-Ponty was appointed to the post of\nMa\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences in Psychology at the\nUniversity of Lyon, where he was promoted to the rank of Professor in\nthe Chair of Psychology in 1948. From 1947 to 1949, he also taught\nsupplementary courses at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure,\nwhere his students included the young Michel Foucault. Student notes\n(taken by Jean Deprun) from Merleau-Ponty\u2019s 1947\u201348 course\non \u201cThe Union of the Soul and the Body in Malebranche, Biran,\nand Bergson\u201d\u2014a course that he taught at both Lyon and\nE.N.S. to prepare students for the agr\u00e9gation and\nwhich was attended by Foucault\u2014were published in 1968\n(1997b/2001). Merleau-Ponty\u2019s notes for several other courses\ntaught at Lyon\u2014\u201cFreedom, especially in Leibniz,\u201d\n\u201cHegel\u2019s Aesthetics,\u201d and \u201cProblems of the\nPhilosophy of History,\u201d were published in 2022 (2022a,\n2022b).\n\nIn 1946 and 1947, Merleau-Ponty gave a number of lectures on French\nexistentialism in Belgium and Scandinavia (2022a), and in 1947 he\nparticipated regularly in the Coll\u00e8ge philosophique, an\nassociation formed by Jean Wahl to provide an open venue for\nintellectual exchange without the academic formality of the Sorbonne,\nand frequented by many leading Parisian thinkers. Merleau-Ponty\npublished his first book of political philosophy in 1947,\nHumanisme et terreur, essai sur le probl\u00e8me communiste\n[Humanism and Terror: An Essay on the Communist Problem,\n1969, HT], in which he responded to the developing opposition between\nliberal democracies and communism by cautioning a\n\u201cwait-and-see\u201d attitude toward Marxism. A collection of\nessays concerning the arts, philosophy, and politics, Sens et\nnon-sense [Sense and Non-Sense, 1996b/1964], appeared in\n1948. In the fall of 1948, Merleau-Ponty delivered a series of seven\nweekly lectures on French national radio that were subsequently\npublished as Causeries 1948 (2002/2004).\n\nMerleau-Ponty declined an invitation to join the Department of\nPhilosophy at the University of Chicago as a Visiting Professor in\n1948\u201349, but instead received a leave from Lyon for the year to\npresent a series of lectures in Mexico and New York in early 1949\n(2022b). Later in 1949, Merleau-Ponty was appointed Professor of Child\nPsychology and Pedagogy at the University of Paris 1\nPanth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, and in this position lectured widely on\nchild development, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, Gestalt psychology,\nand anthropology. His eight courses from the Sorbonne are known from\ncompiled student notes reviewed by him and published in the\nSorbonne\u2019s Bulletin de psychologie (1988/2010).\nMerleau-Ponty held this position for three years until his election,\nin 1952, to the Chair of Philosophy at the Coll\u00e8ge de France,\nthe most prestigious post for a philosopher in France, which he would\nhold until his death in 1961. At forty-four, Merleau-Ponty was the\nyoungest person ever elected to this position, but his appointment was\nnot without controversy. Rather than following the typical procedure\nof ratifying the vote of the General Assembly of Professors, who had\nselected Merleau-Ponty as their lead candidate, the\nAcad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques made the\nunprecedented decision to remove his name from the list of candidates;\nthe Acad\u00e9mie\u2019s decision was subsequently\noverturned by the Minister of Education himself, who allowed the\nfaculty vote in favor of Merleau-Ponty to stand. Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nJanuary 1953 inaugural lecture at the Coll\u00e8ge de France was\npublished under the title \u00c9loge de la Philosophie\n[In Praise of Philosophy, 1953/1963]. Many of his courses\nfrom the Coll\u00e8ge de France have subsequently been published,\nbased either on student notes or Merleau-Ponty\u2019s own lecture\nnotes (1964b, 1968/1970, 1995/2003, 1996a/2022, 1998/2002, 2003/2010,\n2011/2020, 2013, 2020).\n\nIn the face of growing political disagreements with Sartre set in\nmotion by the Korean War, Merleau-Ponty resigned his role as political\neditor of Les Temps Modernes in December of 1952 and withdrew\nfrom the editorial board altogether in 1953. His critique of\nSartre\u2019s politics became public in 1955 with Les Aventures\nde la dialectique [Adventures of the Dialectic, 1973\nAdD], in which Merleau-Ponty distanced himself from revolutionary\nMarxism and sharply criticized Sartre for\n\u201cultrabolshevism\u201d. Beauvoir\u2019s equally biting\nrebuttal, \u201cMerleau-Ponty and Pseudo-Sartreanism\u201d,\npublished the same year in Les Temps Modernes, accuses\nMerleau-Ponty of willfully misrepresenting Sartre\u2019s position,\nopening a rift between the three former friends that would never\nentirely heal. Merleau-Ponty\u2019s intellectual circle during his\nyears at the Coll\u00e8ge de France included L\u00e9vi-Straus and\nJacques Lacan, and for several years he was a regular contributor to\nthe popular weekly magazine L\u2019Express. In October and\nNovember 1955, on a commission from Alliance\nfran\u00e7aise, Merleau-Ponty visited several African\ncountries, including Tunisia, French Equatorial Africa, the Belgian\nCongo, and Kenya, where he delivered a series of lectures on the\nconcept of race, colonialism, and development. In 1956, he published\nLes Philosophes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres [Famous\nPhilosophers], a large edited volume of original introductions to\nkey historical and contemporary thinkers (beginning, interestingly,\nwith philosophers from India and China) whose contributors included\nGilles Deleuze, Gilbert Ryle, Alfred Schutz, and Jean Starobinski. In\nApril 1957, Merleau-Ponty declined to accept induction into\nFrance\u2019s Order of the Legion of Honor, presumably in protest\nover the inhumane actions of the Fourth Republic, including the use of\ntorture, during the Battle of Algiers. In October and November of\n1957, as his second commission from Alliance\nfran\u00e7aise, he lectured in Madagascar, Reunion Island, and\nMauritius, citing as a primary motivation for accepting the commission\nhis desire to see first-hand the effects of reforms in French policies\ngoverning overseas territories. The last book Merleau-Ponty published\nduring his lifetime, Signes [Signs, 1960/1964],\nappearing in 1960, collecting essays on art, language, the history of\nphilosophy, and politics that spanned more than a decade. His last\npublished essay, \u201cL\u2019\u0152il et l\u2019esprit\u201d\n[\u201cEye and Mind\u201d, 1964a OEE] addressing the ontological\nimplications of painting, appeared in the 1961 inaugural issue of\nArt de France. Merleau-Ponty died of a heart attack in Paris\non May 3rd, 1961, at the age of 53, with Descartes\u2019\nOptics open on his desk.\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s friend and former student Claude Lefort\npublished two of his teacher\u2019s unfinished manuscripts\nposthumously: La prose du monde [The Prose of the\nWorld, 1969/1973], an exploration of literature and expression\ndrafted in 1950\u201351 and apparently abandoned; and Le visible\net l\u2019invisible [The Visible and the Invisible,\n1968 V&I], a manuscript and numerous working notes from\n1959\u20131961 that present elements of Merleau-Ponty\u2019s mature\nontology. The latter manuscript was apparently part of a larger\nproject, \u00catre et Monde [Being and World], for\nwhich two additional unpublished sections were substantially drafted\nin 1957\u20131958: La Nature ou le monde du silence\n[Nature or the World of Silence] and Introduction\n\u00e0 l\u2019ontologie [Introduction to Ontology]\n(Saint Aubert 2013:\n 28).[4]\n These manuscripts, along with many of Merleau-Ponty\u2019s other\nunpublished notes and papers, were donated to the Biblioth\u00e8que\nNationale de France by Suzanne Merleau-Ponty in 1992 and are available\nfor consultation by\n scholars.[5]\n Several volumes of previously unpublished lectures, working notes,\ninterview transcriptions, letters, and other archival materials have\nalso been published posthumously (2016, 2018, 2022a, 2022b,\n2022c).\n",
