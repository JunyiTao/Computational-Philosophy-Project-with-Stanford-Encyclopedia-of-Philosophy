By this, he means to say\nthat most philosophy reproduces, in highly abstract form, notions\nabout the world whose effect is to sustain existing socio-economic\nrelations. As such, philosophy merely reflects the background values,\nattitudes, and ideas that allow the socio-economic world to function.\nHowever, for Althusser, genuine philosophy functions as a\n\u201cTheory of theoretical practice\u201d (1965b). In this mode, it\nworks to provide an aid to scientific practice by distinguishing\nbetween ideological concepts and scientific ones as well as by\nclarifying and rendering consistent the scientific concepts that\nenable a science to transforms existing ideas into scientific\nknowledge.\n\nFor Althusser, it is not necessary that this process of distinction\nand clarification be accomplished before a specific theoretical\npractice can generate scientific knowledge. In fact, scientific\nactivity often proceeds without a clear understanding of the concepts\nthat allow it to produce its knowledge. Indeed, Althusser maintained\nthat this was Marx\u2019s lot when he was writing Capital:\nscientific knowledge of the capitalist economic system was being\nproduced, but Marx did not possess a full awareness of the concepts\nallowing this production. According to this definition of philosophy\nas the Theory of theoretical practice, Althusser\u2019s re-reading of\nCapital and other texts was philosophical insofar as it was\nable to name and distinguish the concepts that allowed Marx\u2019s\nscientific analysis of history to proceed.\n",
