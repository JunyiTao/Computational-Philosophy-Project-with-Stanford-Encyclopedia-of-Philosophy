    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nThomas Aquinas was born near Aquino, halfway between Rome and Naples,\naround the year 1225. He was the youngest of at least nine children,\nand born into a wealthy family that presided over a prominent castle\nin Roccasecca. As a teenage student in Naples, he fell under the sway\nof the Dominicans, a newly founded order of priests devoted to\npreaching and learning. Joining the order at the age of nineteen, he\nwas assigned to Paris for further study, but his plans were delayed by\nthe intransigency of his parents, who had hoped he would play a\nleading role at the venerable local monastery, Monte Cassino, where he\nhad studied as a child. After confining him to Roccasecca for a year,\nhis parents yielded and Thomas went to Paris as a Dominican friar.\n\nThomas spent three years in Paris, studying philosophy, and then was\nsent to Cologne, in 1248, under the supervision of\n Albert the Great.\n This older Dominican proved to be the ideal mentor. Albert was at the\ntime the leading figure in the newly prominent program of melding\nChristian theology with Greek and Arabic philosophy. He possessed an\nencyclopedic grasp of the sciences of the day, which had been\nexpanding at a dizzying pace thanks to the new availability of the\nAristotelian corpus in Latin translation. It was Albert\u2019s firm\nconviction, which became Aquinas\u2019s own, that the Christian faith\ncould only benefit from a profound engagement with philosophy and\nscience.\n\nThomas evidently flourished under Albert\u2019s influence, for when\nAlbert was asked in 1252 to nominate a student to pursue an advanced\ndegree in theology at the University of Paris, he chose Thomas, even\nthough he was still two years younger than the minimum required age.\nAfter four years as a bachelor of theology, lecturing on the Bible and\non Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, Aquinas received his\ndoctorate and was immediately appointed master of theology, once again\nat an earlier age than the statutes officially allowed. From 1256\nuntil 1259, he held the Dominican chair of theology in Paris,\npreaching, lecturing on the Bible, and presiding over various\nphilosophical and theological disputations.\n\nAlthough some masters at the University of Paris spent decades\nteaching there, it was the custom of the Dominican order (as with the\nFranciscans) to rotate scholars through these positions. Accordingly,\nin 1259 Aquinas was sent back to Italy, where he spent most of the\nfollowing decade in several Dominican houses of study, first in\nOrvieto (in Umbria) and then in Rome. During these years, while he\ncontinued to preach, lecture on the Bible, and conduct academic\ndisputations, he found the time to develop his two most important\nworks, the Summa contra gentiles and the Summa\ntheologiae.\n\nIn 1268, Aquinas was asked to return to Paris for an unusual second\nterm as master of theology. Here he put his now venerable reputation\nto work in attempting to steer the philosophical conversation away\nfrom various extreme positions that were dividing scholars. He wrote a\nbrief treatise arguing for a middle ground on the vexed question of\nwhether the world could be proved to be eternal or created in time\n(\u00a73), and a somewhat longer treatise against the view that all\nhuman beings share a single intellect (\u00a76.2). These years were\ndominated, though, by his efforts to complete the Summa\ntheologiae and at the same time write commentaries on all of\nAristotle\u2019s principal works. When his second four-year term in\nParis came to an end he returned to Italy, this time to Naples, in\n1272. During these final years he nearly, but not quite, finished both\nthe Summa theologiae and his commentary series. Instead,\nafter a year and a half in Naples, he stopped writing, famously\nexplaining that \u201cAll that I have written seems to me like straw\ncompared with what has now been revealed to me.\u201d A few months\nafter that he died, in the Cistercian abbey of Fossanova, on March 7,\n1274.\n\nThis chronology of Aquinas\u2019s life is fairly well attested. There\nare also many colorful stories about his life, many of which stem from\ntestimony given during his canonization inquiry in 1319. The\nauthenticity of these stories is unknowable. Aquinas himself, in his\nwritings, reveals almost nothing about his personal life. (For\nbiography see Porro 2012 [2016]; Torrell 1993 [2022]; Legge 2022.)\n",
