    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It || Transcendental Deduction, 1st Edition\n2.3 Transcendental Deduction, 1st Edition\n\n\nThen we get to the second chapter of the Transcendental Logic, the\nbrilliant and baffling Transcendental Deduction (TD). Recall the two\nmovements just discussed, the one from experience to its conditions and\nthe one from Aristotelian functions of judgment to the concepts that we must\nuse in all judging (the Categories). This duality led Kant to his\nfamous question of right (quid juris) (A84=B116): with what\nright do we apply the Categories, which are not acquired from\nexperience, to the contents of experience? (A85=B117). Kant\u2019s problem\nhere is not as arcane as it might seem. It reflects an important\nquestion: How is it that the world as we experience it conforms to our\nlogic? In briefest form, Kant thought that the trick to showing how it\nis possible for the Categories to apply to experience is to\nshow that it is necessary that they apply\n (A97).[4]\n\n\n\nTD has two sides, though Kant never treats them separately. He once\ncalled them the objective and the subjective deductions (Axvii). The\nobjective deduction is about the conceptual and other cognitive\nconditions of having representations of objects. It is Kant\u2019s answer to\nthe quid juris question. Exactly how the objective deduction\ngoes is highly controversial, a controversy that we will sidestep here.\nThe subjective deduction is about what the mind, the \u201csubjective\nsources\u201d of understanding (A97), must as a consequence be like.\nThe subjective deduction is what mainly interests us.\n\n\nKant argues as follows. Our experiences have objects, that is, they are about\nsomething. The objects of our experiences are discrete, unified\nparticulars. To have such particulars available to it, the mind must\nconstruct them based on sensible input. To construct them, the mind\nmust do three kinds of synthesis. It must generate temporal and spatial\nstructure (Synthesis of Apprehension in Intuition). It must associate\nspatio-temporally structured items with other spatio-temporally\nstructured items (Synthesis of Reproduction in the Imagination). And it\nmust recognize items using concepts, the Categories in particular\n(Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept). This threefold doctrine of\nsynthesis is one of the cornerstones of Kant\u2019s model of the mind. We\nwill consider it in more detail in the next Section.\n\n\nThe \u2018deduction of the categories\u2019 should now be\ncomplete. Strangely enough, the chapter has only nicely got started. In\nthe first edition version, for example, we have only reached A106,\nabout one-third of the way through the chapter. At this point, Kant\nintroduces the notion of transcendental apperception for the first time\nand the unity of such apperception, the unity of consciousness.\nEvidently, something is happening (something, moreover, not at all well\nheralded in the text). We will see what when we discuss Kant\u2019s doctrine\nof synthesis below.\n\n\nWe can now understand in more detail why Kant said that the subjective\ndeduction is inessential (Axvii). Since the objective deduction is\nabout the conditions of representations having objects, a better name\nfor it might have been \u2018deduction of the\nobject\u2019. Similarly, a better name for the subjective deduction\nmight have been \u2018the deduction of the subject\u2019 or\n\u2018the deduction of the subject\u2019s nature\u2019. The latter\nenquiry was inessential to Kant\u2019s main critical project because the\nmain project was to defend the synthetic a priori credentials\nof physics in the objective deduction. From this point of view,\nanything uncovered about the nature and functioning of the mind was a\nhappy accident.\n",
