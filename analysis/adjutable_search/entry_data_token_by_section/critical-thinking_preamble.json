    "main_text": "\n\nCritical thinking is a widely accepted educational goal. Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n",
