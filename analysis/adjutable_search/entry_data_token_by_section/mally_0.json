    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nErnst Mally was born October 11, 1879 in Krainburg, then a town of\nthe Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and today Kranj in Slovenia. After the\ndeath of his father in 1888, the family moved to Laibach, today\nLjubljana, the capital of Slovenia. There, Mally attended the Gymnasium\nfrom 1890 to 1898. At this time, Mally already formed a nationalist\nattitude, becoming a supporter of Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer, the\nleader of the Austrian \u201cdeutschnationale Bewegung\u201d, a\nGerman national, anti-semitic, anti-liberal and anti-catholic group\nthat demanded the \u201cAnschluss\u201d (annexation) of Austria to\nGermany even before the First World War. During his years in the\nGymnasium, Mally developed a serious interest in philosophy, and in\n1898, he started studying philosophy with Alexius Meinong at the\nUniversity of Graz, Austria. There he also studied mathematics and\nphysics, for he felt that this would enable him to achieve greater\nprecision in his philosophical thinking and writings. During this time,\nMally developed a special interest in formal logic.\n\n\nMally earned his philosophical doctorate in 1903, with the\ndissertation Untersuchungen zur Gegenstandstheorie des\nMessens (Investigations in the Object Theory of\nMeasurement), which was published in 1904. Alexius Meinong was\nhis supervisor. In 1906, he started teaching at a Gymnasium in Graz,\nyet stayed in contact with the university, especially with Meinong and\nthe then already famous Laboratory for Experimental Psychology, which\nhad been founded by Meinong in 1894. In 1913, Mally became Dozent with\nhis Habilitation thesis, which was titled Gegenstandstheoretische\nGrundlagen der Logik und Logistik (Object-theoretic\nFoundations for Logics and Logistics) and published in\n1912. Again, Alexius Meinong was his supervisor.  During World War I,\nMally served in the Austrian Army from 1915 to 1918. In this period,\nMally contracted \u201ca serious disease called rheumatoid arthritis,\n[resulting] in a 70% invalidity that led to a growing and painful\nimmobility\u201d (Wolf 1971: 3), lasting for the rest of his\nlife. After the end of the war, he started teaching at the University\nof Graz, where he eventually succeeded to Meinong\u2019s Chair in 1925. He\nstayed there until 1942. After his retirement, he moved to Schwanberg,\nStyria, where he lived two more years and died rather unexpectedly\nMarch 8, 1944.
