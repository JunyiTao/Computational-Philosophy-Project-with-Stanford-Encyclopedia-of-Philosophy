Rationality and Rationalism\n\n\nWhat Oakeshott calls \u201cRationalism\u201d is the belief, in his\nview illusory, that there are \u201ccorrect\u201d answers to\npractical questions. It is the belief that an action or policy is\nrational only when it rests on knowledge whose truth can be\ndemonstrated. Its error is thinking that correct decisions can be made\nsimply by applying rules or calculating consequences. In an early\nessay, Oakeshott distinguishes between \u201ctechnical\u201d and\n\u201ctraditional\u201d knowledge. Technical knowledge is knowledge,\nwhether of facts or rules, that is easily learned and applied, even by\nthose who are without experience. Traditional knowledge, in contrast,\nis \u201cknowing how\u201d rather than \u201cknowing that\u201d\n(Ryle 1949). It is acquired by engaging in an activity and involves\njudgment in handling facts or rules (RP\n12\u201317). Knowledge often involves an element of rule-following\nbut using rules skillfully or prudently means going beyond the\ninstructions they provide. Even a simple rule, like \u201cno vehicles\nin the park\u201d (Hart 1958), implies an element of judgment. This\nholds for collective as well as individual decisions and for political\nas well as private ones. But if technical knowledge has limits, so\ndoes traditional knowledge. We cannot conclude that experience and\njudgment are infallible: clearly, they are not. \n\n\nPolitical deliberation occurs when a public decision needs to be made\nand a proposed course of action defended. But deciding which course of\naction to pursue involves more than simply applying rules or\ncalculating costs and benefits. It requires interpretation and\njudgment. We must decide which rule to use and then interpret what it\nmeans in a given situation. If, alternatively, we choose an action\nbased on its likely consequences, we must judge the expected value of\nthose consequences, and this involves making value judgments as well\nas estimating probabilities. Whether we are applying rules or\ncalculating outcomes, we must work with what we presume to be facts,\nthough these are always uncertain in various ways. For these reasons,\nthere is never a demonstrably correct course of action. Political\narguments cannot be proved or disproved; they can only be shown to be\nmore or less convincing than other such arguments. Political\ndiscourse, then, is a discourse of contingencies and conjectures, not\nof certainties or context-independent truths. It is persuasive and\nrhetorical, not a matter of demonstration or proof (RP\n70\u201395).\n\n\nThese are familiar points, made by Oakeshott with particular\nclarity. What he adds to other philosophical discussions of practical\nreasoning, such as Aristotle\u2019s treatment of techne and\nphron\u0113sis (Nichomachean Ethics 1142a) or\nKant\u2019s remarks on judgment as the middle term between rules and\napplications (Kant 1793: 8:275), are reflections on how practical, and\nin particular political, discourse can cause disasters when these\npoints are overlooked. His conclusions rest on a dissection of\nideological politics, which, Oakeshott thought, reflects a\ncharacteristically modern disposition to substitute rules\u2014which\ncan be moral, historical, scientific, or divine\u2014for judgment in\npractical reasoning. The rules that are thought to govern practice are\nnot independent of practical activity but abstracted from it. They are\n\u201cabridgments\u201d of customs, habits, traditions, and skills\n(RP 121). To borrow language from Michael Walzer, they are\ninterpretations rather than discoveries or inventions (Walzer\n1987). And what they interpret are ways of doing things: \n\n\nthe pedigree of every political ideology shows it to be the creature,\nnot of premeditation in advance of political activity, but of\nmeditation upon a manner of politics. (RP 51) \n\n \nRationalists, unaware of the local origins of the universal\nprinciples that they imagine they have identified, reject knowledge\ngained through experience in favor of something they call reason or\nscience. Whether deductive or computational, this abstract reason is\nthought to guarantee greater certainty than experience and judgment\ncan provide. The fallacy of Rationalism, in other words, is that the\nknowledge that it identifies as rational is itself really a product of\nexperience and judgment. It consists of rules, methods, or techniques\nabstracted from practice\u2014tools that, far from being substitutes\nfor experience and judgment, cannot be effectively used in their\nabsence.\n\nIn his essays on Rationalism, Oakeshott discusses many examples of\nideological politics. He dissects the rhetorical strategies of Locke,\nBentham, and Marx and takes contemporaries to task for thinking that\npolitical conclusions can be extracted from religious or scientific\nprinciples or from what are believed to be the lessons of\nhistory. Marxism, for example, claims that laws of historical change\ncan be discerned scientifically and practical guidance derived from\nthem. But the claim should be understood as a rhetorical one that can\npersuade only those who already believe it (Oakeshott 2008:\n168\u2013177). In his Lectures in the History of Political\nThought (Oakeshott 2006: 469\u2013482) and On Human\nConduct (OHC 263\u2013316), he discusses the arguments\nof Francis Bacon, the German Cameralists, and others who impute some\ncollective purpose to the state as an enterprise for promoting some\nparticular substantive goal. This goal might be religious, economic,\nimperial, or therapeutic. Bacon, for example, argues that the purpose\nof government is to exploit nature, which implies mobilizing labor for\nthe sake of collective welfare\u2014an implication explored and\ndeveloped by later thinkers, often but not only those identified as\nsocialist. The \u201ccollective\u201d and \u201cwelfare\u201d\nelements of this understanding of the modern state, like the more\ngeneral theme of exploiting nature for human ends, have become\nubiquitous. Oakeshott examines seventeenth-century Puritanism,\neighteenth-century enlightened despotism, and twentieth-century\nfascism and communism, all of which see the state as a corporate\nenterprise of some kind, as instances of what he calls\n\u201ctelocracy\u201d (or \u201cteleocracy\u201d). In each case,\nthe collective goal is tied to an ideology that professes to offer\nguidance for how to achieve the goal. \n \nThese explorations of ideological politics took Oakeshott in two\ndirections. One, discussed in Section 4 below, was to distinguish\nalternative understandings of the modern European state, each of which\ncould appear as either an analytical concept or an ideology. The other\nwas to affirm the independence of explanatory theorizing from\npractical engagement by questioning the commonly affirmed \u201cunity\nof theory and practice\u201d\u2014an argument, discernible in\nHeidegger and Gadamer, American pragmatism, and Frankfurt School\ncritical theory, for the practical character of all knowledge (Neill\n2013). Heidegger treats practical experience not as one mode of\nunderstanding among others but as the primordial experience from which\nnothing human can free itself. For pragmatists from Peirce to Rorty,\nideas arise from our relationship to nature, which is how it affects\nus and our projects. For critical theorists, all theorizing is\ndetermined by the practical concerns that motivate it and is therefore\nimplicitly if not explicitly prescriptive. Even philosophy is\npractical, at least when it deals with ethics and politics, for those\nwho offer practical guidance under the labels of normative or applied\nethics. Moral philosophy, they argue, aims primarily to judge and\nguide conduct and only secondarily and instrumentally to understand\nit. A similar point is made about political philosophy.\n\n\nOakeshott worked hard to rebut the argument that political philosophy\nis inherently and unavoidably practical. Not only is it possible to\ndistinguish political philosophy from its object, political activity,\nbut its claim to being philosophical demands that the distinction be\nrecognized. In Oakeshott\u2019s view, moral philosophy properly\nso-called is theorizing about morality (metaethics). It is concerned\nto understand and explain, not to prescribe. Prescriptive or normative\nethics, he argued early on, is \u201cpseudo-philosophy\u201d\n(EM 331\u2013346) because it mixes theorizing with\nmoralising. Just as a theory of jokes is not itself a joke\n(OHC 10), a theory of morality is not itself a morality. The\nobject of theorizing is a \u201cgoing-on\u201d to be reflected upon\n(\u201ctheorized\u201d) by an observer (a \u201ctheorist\u201d)\nwhose reflections may generate conclusions (\u201ctheorems\u201d),\nhowever provisional (Oakeshott 2004: 391; OHC 3). Theorizing\nis distinguished from what Oakeshott calls \u201cdoing\u201d in that\nthe product of theorizing is an understanding, a theorem or\nproposition, not, as in the case of doing, an action. In doing,\nwhatever reflection takes place involves deliberating about what to\ndo. The theorizing that distinguishes genuine historical and\nscientific inquiry from pseudo-history or pseudo-science is not\naction-oriented and prescriptive but explanatory. What distinguishes\nphilosophical from historical or scientific inquiry is that philosophy\nis more critical in examining the presuppositions of inquiry: where\nscientists or historians want to get on with their work, the\nphilosopher is concerned to problematize that work and to examine the\nexperience of thinking itself. Political philosophy, then, is properly\nphilosophical when it examines the presuppositions of political\nactivity. \n\n\nAn objection to distinguishing theory and practice in this way is that\nit treats as categorial a distinction better understood as one of\ndegree. Political theory is messy. It involves describing and judging,\nexplaining and prescribing, and it is not always clear where one\nbegins and the other ends. They are certainly joined in\nOakeshott\u2019s writings despite his arguments for keeping them\nseparate (Haddock 2005). But the objection affirms rather than denies\nthe distinction. This is not to say that it cannot be challenged, but\nto push the discussion further we must rethink the terms involved, for\nexample by defining practical reasoning as reasoning that results in\nchanges in belief as well as action (Wallace\n2020). Alternatively, we might treat the theory-practice distinction\nas contextual: a philosopher\u2019s theoretical argument can appear\npractical when read historically as a move in some debate (Nardin\n2015: 318\u2013319). \n\n\nFor Oakeshott, philosophy is distinctive because it questions rather\nthan uses other kinds of knowledge. Theorizing politics is therefore\nnot the same as engaging in politics, and to the extent that\ntheorizing is itself political it loses its distinctive character. The\nirony of critical theory is that there must be things of which it is\nuncritical in order to do what it purports to do: one cannot question\nand act at the same time. The contribution of political philosophy,\nfor Oakeshott, is not to generate ideologies or recommend policies but\nto understand political activity in terms of its assumptions. The\nknowledge it generates, moreover,\n\nis always provisional. Because scientific or historical knowledge is also provisional, this might seem to blur the distinction between philosophy and other kinds of inquiry. But philosophy is distinguished by its relentlessness in questioning presuppositions: it is an inquiry \n\n\nin which questions are asked not in order to be answered but so that\nthey may themselves be interrogated with respect to their conditions.\n(OHC 11) \n\n \nTo embrace this activity is to escape the prison of one\u2019s\ncurrent understanding. For the philosopher, it means leaving politics\nand even political philosophy behind to pursue other concerns. This is\nnot intended as a description of what political philosophers do (they\ndo many things) nor a prescription for how they should proceed; it is\nthe product of Oakeshott\u2019s reflections on his own experience in\nmoving from engaging political arguments to uncovering their\npresuppositions.\n",
