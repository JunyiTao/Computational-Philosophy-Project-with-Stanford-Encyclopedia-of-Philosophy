Transcendentals as First Objects of the Intellect\n\n\nAn important aspect of the transcendentals is that they are the\nfirst in a cognitive respect. Medieval authors frequently indicate the\nwhole group of transcendental concepts as first conceptions, although\nin a strict sense only the concept of \u2018being\u2019 is the first\nknown, to which the other transcendental determinations add their\nproper characteristics. As already Ibn Sina remarked \u2013 to whom\nthe theoreticians of the doctrine of the transcendentals owed the very\nidea of first conceptions \u2013 these notions cannot be defined by\nsome higher genus and must, therefore, be self-evident. They are made\nknown by a conceptual analysis (resolutio) that leads to the\nmost common as first known, which the synthetical construction of\nknowledge takes as its starting point. What is uncovered in this way is\nsomething implicitly present in all cognition, as the formal condition\nof all knowledge.\n\n\nThis aspect was brought to the fore by Thomas Aquinas in what has\ncome to be known as \u2018the objective turn\u2019. In his commentary\non Boethius\u2019 De trinitate, Aquinas advances the thesis\nthat \u201cto each [cognitive] power, its proper object is first\nknown\u201d (Super Boethium De trinitate, q. 1, art.\n3). Since what specifies a cognitive power is its proper object \u2013\ni.e. the formal aspect under which something is represented by that\npower \u2013, the identification of the first known with the proper\nobject of the intellect presents a significant claim. What is first in\nthe order of conceptual cognition is most common and self-evident not\nby accident, for it indicates the formal aspect of intelligibility,\nwhich is included in all knowledge and about which the intellect cannot\nbe uncertain. As such, it indicates the horizon of cognition. This\npromotion of a most common element of knowledge to the very horizon of\nknowledge, which was broadly acknowledged in the medieval debate on the\nfirst known, turned the medieval debate into a critique of\nknowledge.\n\n\nIn reaction to the early Franciscan doctrine of God as first known\n(Guibert of Tournai, Bonaventure), Aquinas distinguished between a\nresolution that leads to what is first and better known in itself (God\nas the first cause) and a resolution that leads to what is first and\nbetter known for us, being in general. In the Summa\ntheologiae, Aquinas even more radically calls the \u2018essence\nof things material\u2019 (quiditas rei materialis)\nthe proper object of the human mind; the point is that man in this life\nhas no knowledge of the essence of immaterial things, which make it\nimpossible that God be known first. Henry of Ghent reinstates the\ndoctrine of God as first known. His theological transformation of the\nfirst concepts, i.e. the priority he accords to the divine over the\ncreaturely within the transcendental concepts as such, makes God\u2019s\nquiddity the first known in natural cognition, only unconsciously and\nindeterminately conceived. Against both Thomas Aquinas and Henry of\nGhent, John Duns Scotus formulated his distribution of the first object\nof the intellect. He distinguishes three orders of intelligibility,\neach of which has its own first object: the order of origin,\nthe order of perfection and the order of adequation.\nThe first adequate object of the intellect is commensurate to\nthe intellective power and indicates the scope of human reason. Neither\nfinite (Aquinas: the essence of material things) nor infinite being\n(Henry of Ghent: God) are the first adequate object of human\nunderstanding, but the concept \u2018being\u2019 that is indifferent\nto finite and infinite being and is univocally common to God\nand\n creature.[6]\n\n\nApart from the thesis that God is first known, the medieval debate\npresented also other positions that challenged the cognitive primacy of\nbeing. On the one hand, the conceptualists: thinkers like Peter of\nAuriol and William of Ockham denied that what is first by commonness,\n\u201cbeing\u201d, would be the adequate \u201cmoving object\u201d\nof the intellect, for something common cannot move the intellect nor\ncause an intellectual cognition. The adequate moving object is the\n\u201cproper entity\u201d of a thing (Peter Auriol) or the singular\nas singular (Ockham). This thesis of the singular as first known was\nerected upon the important distinction between intuitive and\nabstractive cognition. On the other hand, some authors claimed that\nsomething more common than \u201cbeing\u201d is first known. Here,\nall early medieval forerunners of the super-transcendental play a role,\nlike the early Scotists (Nicolas Bonetus, Francis of Marchia) and other\nthinkers like Walter Burley and John Baconthorpe. They object to the\nprimacy of being that the notion is not commensurate to the scope of\nintelligibility; something else that transcends the realm of real being\nand that is common to real being and being of reason, e.g. the concept\nof \u2018thing\u2019 or \u2018something\u2019, is truly the first\nadequate object of the\n intellect.[7]\n",
