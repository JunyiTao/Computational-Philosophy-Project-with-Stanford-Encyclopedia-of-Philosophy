    "preamble": "\n\nFrederick Douglass (c. 1817\u20131895) is a central figure in U.S.\nand African American\n history.[1]\n He was born into slavery circa 1817; his mother was an enslaved black\nwoman, while his father was reputed to be his white master. Douglass\nescaped from slavery in 1838 and rose to become a principal leader and\nspokesperson for the U.S. Abolition\n movement.[2]\n He would eventually develop into a towering figure for the U.S. Civil\nRights Movement and American politics, and his legacy would be claimed\nby a diverse span of groups, from liberals and integrationists to\nconservatives to nationalists, within and without black America.\n\nHe wrote three autobiographies, each one expanding on the details of\nhis life. The first was Narrative of the Life of Frederick\nDouglass, an American Slave, Written By Himself (1845); the\nsecond was My Bondage and My Freedom (1855); and the third\nwas Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\n (1881/1893).[3]\n They are now foremost examples of the American slave narrative. In\naddition to being autobiographical, they are also, as is standard,\nexplicitly works of political and social criticism and moral suasion;\nthey aim at the hearts and minds of the readers. Their greater purpose\nwas to attack slavery, contribute to its abolition in the United\nStates, and argue for black Americans\u2019 full inclusion into the\nnation.\n\nShortly after escaping from slavery, Douglass began operating as a\nspokesperson, giving numerous speeches about his life and experiences\nfor William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s American Anti-Slavery Society. To\nspread his story and assist the abolitionist cause and counter early\ncharges that someone so eloquent as he could not have been a slave,\nDouglass wrote and published his first autobiography, The\nNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,\nWritten By Himself. It brought Douglass fame throughout the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom, and it provided the funds to\npurchase his freedom. Douglass eventually broke with Garrison and\nfounded his first paper, the North Star. He served as its\nchief editor and authored a considerable body of letters, editorials,\nand speeches from then on. These writings are collected in Philip\nFoner\u2019s multi-volume, The Life and Writings of Frederick\nDouglass (1950\u20131975), and John W. Blassingame and John R.\nMcKivigan\u2019s multi-volume, The Frederick Douglass Papers\n (1979\u20131992).[4]\n\nDouglass\u2019s advocacy in the abolition movement and his continued\nwork after the U.S. Civil War, and his writings and participation in\nnational discussions about the nature and future of the American\nRepublic, made him a significant figure in American history and the\nhistory of American political ideas. His writings, speeches, and his\nnational and international work have inspired many lines of discussion\nin debate within the fields of American and African American history\nand political science. Moreover, political thinkers representing\ndifferent ideological positions, including liberals, libertarians, and\neconomic and social conservatives, claim his legacy.\n\nBut what does anything about this have to do with philosophy? The\nconnections between Douglass\u2019s legacy and social and political\nphilosophy are numerous and ongoing. His ideas about humanity,\nliberty, equality, property, democracy, and individual and social\ndevelopment addressed immediately pressing concerns, but they were\nalso theoretical\u2014he self-consciously addressed their moral and\ntheological foundations. Furthermore, his work is connected to\nacademic philosophy through the uptake of his political and social\nlegacy and writings by later African American philosophers such as\nW.E.B. Du Bois (1868\u20131963) and Alain Locke\n (1884\u20131954).[5]\n In contemporary philosophy, Douglass\u2019s work is usually taken up\nwithin American philosophy, Africana philosophy, black political\nphilosophy, and moral, social, and political philosophy more broadly.\nIn particular, the discussions that involve Douglass focus on his\nviews concerning some of the topics reviewed in this entry: slavery\nand racial segregation; natural law and the U.S. constitution;\nliberalism and republicanism; violence, self-respect, and dignity;\nracial integration versus emigration or separation; cultural\nassimilation and racial amalgamation; democratic action; and\nwomen\u2019s suffrage. Additionally, just as there is a rich\ndiscussion about Douglass in philosophy and political theory, there is\na related discussion about Douglass\u2019s rhetoric, particularly the\nstructure and meaning of his political rhetoric as displayed in his\nspeeches, autobiographies, and other\n writings.[6]\n\nFor students and teachers first learning about Douglass, there is no\nbetter place to start than his first autobiography, The Narrative\nof the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845). Next, read some of his\nspeeches and writings referenced in this entry, especially \u201cWhat\nTo the Slave Is The Fourth of July?\u201d (1852 [SFD: 55\u201392]).\nThen dive into the historical, political, literary, and philosophical\nliterature about Douglass.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Slavery\n\nIn his narratives, speeches, and articles leading up to the U.S. Civil\nWar, Douglass vigorously argued against slavery. He sought to\ndemonstrate that it was cruel, unnatural, ungodly, immoral, and\nunjust. Douglass laid out his arguments, first in his speeches while\nallied with William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s American Anti-Slavery\nSociety, and then in his first autobiography, the Narrative.\nAs the U.S. Civil War drew closer, he expanded his arguments in many\nspeeches, editorials, and his second autobiography, My Bondage and\nMy\n Freedom.[7]\n\nHis definition of slavery identified its immorality and injustice by\npinpointing its core wrong in the brutalization and the literal\ncommodification of another human being and the stripping of them of\ntheir natural rights:\n\n\nSlavery in the United States is the granting of that power by which on\nman exercises and enforces a right of property in the body and soul of\nanother. The condition of a slave is simply that of the brute\nbeast. He is a piece of property\u2014a marketable\ncommodity in the language of the law, to be bought and sold at\nthe will and caprice of the master who claims him to be his property;\nhe is spoken of, thought of, and treated as property. His own good,\nhis conscience, his intellect, his affections are all set aside by the\nmaster. The will and the wishes of the master are the law of the\nslave. He is as much a piece of property as a horse. (1846 [SFD: 23];\nmy\n emphasis)[8]\n\n\nIn his own words, he worked to pour out \u201cscorching irony\u201d\nto expose the evil of slavery (1852 [SFD: 71]). His rebellion against\nslavery began, as he recounted, while he was enslaved. In his\nnarratives, the depiction of his early recognition and general\nrecognition among blacks and some whites of the injustice,\nunnaturalness, and cruelty of slavery was a significant element of his\nargument. It marks his first argument against slavery. Some of the\napologists for slavery claimed that blacks were beasts, subhuman, or\nat least a degenerated form of the human species, drawing on a racial\nideology that went back to at least the fifteenth century and that was\ncommon in the British American Colonies and then the United\n States.[9]\n Thomas Jefferson, for example, infamously intimates this racist view\nin his Notes on the State of Virginia (1785: Query 14).\nAgainst such racist ideology, Douglass argued that blacks were human,\nrational, and capable of the full range of human emotions and\nsensitivity. He mocked slavery\u2019s apologists for their\nhypocrisies and contradictions when they claimed otherwise. In\n\u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d, he is derisive\nof the idea that he would even need to argue this point (1852 [SFD:\n 55\u201392]).[10]\n\nAgainst the claim that blacks were beasts, he argued that instead,\nslavery had brutalized them. He pointed to the obviousness of\nblacks\u2019 humanity and mocked the hypocrisy of slavery\u2019s\napologists. He rhetorically asked: Why should there be special laws\nprohibiting the free actions of blacks, such as rebelling against\nslave masters, or any other white person, if slaves were merely\nbestial and incapable of independent, responsible behavior? Indeed,\nwhy had slave masters encouraged their slaves\u2019 Christianization\nand then forbade their religious gatherings? Along with this\nhypocrisy, American slaveholders feared and banned the education of\nblacks while demanding and profiting from their learning and\ndevelopment in the skilled trades. Thus, Douglass argued the\naccusation that blacks were beasts was predicated on the guilty\nknowledge that they were humans. Additionally, it subverted not only\nthe natural goodness of blacks by brutalizing them, but it also did so\nto white slaveholders and those otherwise innocent whites affected by\nthis wicked institution. Slavery, Douglass pointed out, consistent\nwith Jefferson\u2019s anxieties in Query 18 of the Notes on the\nState of Virginia (1785), was a poison in the body of the\nrepublic.\n\nSecond, since blacks were humans, Douglass argued they were entitled\nto the natural rights that natural law mandated\n (\u00a72\n and\n \u00a73)\n and that the United States recognized in the Declaration of\nIndependence and Constitution\n (\u00a74).\n Slavery subverted the natural rights of blacks by subjugating and\nbrutalizing them: taking men and turning them, against God\u2019s\nwill and nature, into beasts. Third, as an affront to natural law,\nslavery contradicted God\u2019s laws and corresponding moral duties\nto others. As a witness and participant of the second Great Awakening,\nhe took the politicized rhetoric of Christian\nredemption\u2014personal and social liberation from\nsin\u2014seriously. Douglass viewed redemption as intrinsically\nwrapped up with freedom from slavery and national liberation like\nother abolitionists. Fourth, he argued that slavery was inconsistent\nwith the idea of America, with its national narrative and highest\nideals, and not just with its founding documents. Fifth, drawing on\ntheories of providential historical development (echoing common\nAmerican views of manifest destiny), he argued that slavery was\ninconsistent with moral, political, economic, and social progress.\nInsofar as it propagated and protected slave power, America was on the\nwrong side of history on the question of slavery.\n\nThe apologists of slavery drew on the same ideological vein of\nhistorical progress to offer the defense that slavery was a benevolent\nand paternal system for the mutual benefit of whites and blacks.\nDouglass countered that calumny by drawing on his experiences, and the\nexperiences of other enslaved black Americans, that American slavery\nwas in no way benevolent. It brutalized black people. Slavery\nsubjected them to debilitating, murderous violence, sexual violence\nand exploitation, split up families, denied them education, exploited\ntheir labor, and denied their natural property rights. Slavery, as\nDouglass\u2019s relentlessly argued, was a deep and enduring\ninjustice and evil. Enslaved black people were not happy slaves\nbenefiting from the largess of kind, gentile white masters. Neither\nwere they lacking in agency, self-esteem, self-respect, or a sense of\ndignity. They were moral beings, fully aware of the rights and\ncapabilities they were unjustly deprived of. As Douglass proclaimed to\nthe nation and world, black Americans wanted freedom, independence,\nthe recognition of their full personhood, moral equality, and their\nrights as U.S. citizens (McGary and Lawson,\n 1992).[11]\n2. Natural Law\n\nThe ideas that Douglass drew on in his arguments against slavery\noriginate from natural law theory and Christian theology. Douglass was\nan Enlightenment thinker, a nineteenth-century modernist, and a\nProtestant, so natural law in his view was a combination of the\nprescriptions of reason and revelation evident in\nthe historical and civilizational progress of humanity. One of his\nclearest articulations of this combined view is from a 1853 speech,\n\u201cThe Present Condition And Future Prospects of the Negro\nPeople\u201d (1853b [FDSW: 250\u2013259]), where condemns\ndeclares,\n\n\nSlavery has no means within itself of perpetuation or permanence. It\nis a huge lie. It is of the Devil, and it will go to its place. It is\nagainst nature, against progress, against improvement, and against the\nGovernment of God. It cannot stand. It has an enemy in every bar of\nrailroad iron, in every electric wire, in every improvement in\nnavigation, in the growing intercourse of nations, in cheap postage,\nin the relaxation of tariffs, in common schools, in the progress of\neducation, the spread of knowledge, in the steam engine, and in the\nWorld\u2019s Fair\u2026and in everything that will be exhibited\nthere. (1853b [FDSW:\n 259])[12]\n\n\nThe sources for his driving belief in natural law and its\nmoral implications were many: the founding documents of the United\nStates; popular intellectuals, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and his\ncolleagues and acquaintances in the American Abolition movement; the\nallies he encountered abroad; and his appreciation of George\nCombe\u2019s The Constitution of Man, from 1834 (Van Wyhe\n2004). However, given the numerous religious references in his\nspeeches and writings, a primary source for his employment of the idea\nof natural law was his adaptation of the American Protestantism of the\nSecond Great Awakening, with its democratic and republican values and\ngenerally independent spirit. All of this is on prominent display at\nthe conclusion of his famous speech, \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth\nfor the Negro\u201d:\n\n\nThe arm of the Lord is not shortened\u201c, and the doom of slavery\nis certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While\ndrawing encouragement from the Declaration of Independence, the great\nprinciples it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my\nspirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. (1852\n[SFD: 90])\n\n\nRelying on the deus ex machina was not enough for Douglass.\nHis vision of natural rights involved action; his image of civic\nrepublicanism emphasized the need for active participation to claim or\nearn one\u2019s rights and status as a citizen (Davis 1971; Pettit\n1997; Myers 2008; Gooding-Williams 2009). As Douglass scathingly\npointed out, the slave-holding states resisted the abolition of\nslavery, and many Americans were apathetic about its cruel\ninjustices\u2014humans resist providential justice. Therefore, he\nargued, the end of slavery required agitation, protest, and, if\nneeded, military intervention.\n\nDouglass longed for God to cast his thunderbolts of judgment at\nAmerican slave power, but he knew that human action was needed to\nabolish slavery in America (Blight 1989: 26\u201358). His view of, if\nyou will, enacted providence is on full display at the end of\nhis famous Fourth of July speech of 1852, where he cited Psalm 68:31\nand paired the idea of God\u2019s fiat with the image of Africa and\nAsia rising:\n\n\nThe far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet.\nThe Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat\nof the Almighty, \u201dLet there be Light\u201c, has not yet spent\nits force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice,\ncan now hide itself from the all-pervading light. The iron shoe, and\ncrippled foot of China must be seen, in contrast with nature. Africa\nmust rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. \u201dEthiopia shall\nstretch out her hand unto God\u201c. (1852 [SFD:\n 91])[13]\n\n\nThere are many possible concerns about Douglass\u2019s view of\nnatural law, manifest destiny, and providence, which we can discern\nfrom a careful reading of the passage above; they involve a belief in\nhistorical teleological development and the human costs of that\nassumption. These costs include affirming nineteenth-century\nconceptions of civilizational backwardness of non-European societies\nor peoples. Thus, he is relatively silent about the United\nStates\u2019 destructive actions against indigenous peoples.\n\nThis aspect of Douglass\u2019s views led Wilson Jeremiah Moses to\ncharacterize him and other early black political figures as\n\u201dMoses\u201c figures: exodus leaders, recipients of natural law\nfor a chosen people. The chosen people, in this case, are African\nAmericans in their travail for freedom, as well as the American\nRepublic as a whole. Douglass\u2014twinned eternally with Abraham\nLincoln\u2014is a lawgiver in the American civil religion (Moses\n1978). This monumental, world-historical vita aside,\nDouglass\u2019s faith in progress, although tested to its breaking\npoint, resulted in his putting too much belief in the inevitability of\nprogress. Nonetheless, his faith had a moral, social, and political\npurpose. He had no time for political pessimism, which is either a\nnarcotizing sentiment for those who have surrendered to despair or a\nperformative luxury whose decadence only those secure in their liberty\ncan afford.\n3. On Liberty\n\nInstead of surrendering to despair, he joined the abolition movement\nafter escaping slavery. And for that grand purpose, natural law and\nrights were ideas he believed in and used to significant effect. Thus,\nin his writings, his writings he repeatedly makes clear and direct\nreferences to concepts that flow from liberalism: liberty; moral and\nsocial equality; individuality; property rights, self-defense, and\nspeech; the moral and instrumental value of labor; democracy; and\ncomposite (what we would call multiethnic or multiracial) nationality.\nThis is why he is rightly associated with liberalism (Myers 2008;\nBuccola 2012). The relation between Douglass\u2019s works and those\nideas is apparent; however, three merit highlighting because they are\nnot typically emphasized in the theoretical literature about Douglass:\nfree speech, property, and composite nationality.\n\nDouglass\u2019s life after abolition speaks to the importance of the\nfreedoms of speech, thought, and opinion and the great value he placed\non them. From his efforts to learn how to read and write to his desire\nto start his own newspaper, his attitude and actions aggressively\nasserted the indivisible links between equal liberty and the right to\nthink and speak one\u2019s mind. Like the name of his first\nnewspaper, this value was his North Star. So, on 9 December\n1860, in response to the violent disruption of a meeting he was\nparticipating in, Douglass directly addressed the matter in his\nspeech, \u201dA Plea for Freedom of Speech in Boston\u201c, wherein\nhe delivered a classic liberal defense of it that still resonates:\n\n\nThere can be no right where any man however, lifted up or humble,\nhowever young or however old, is overawed by force, and compelled to\nsuppress his honest sentiments. (1860c [FDP1 v.3: 423])\n\n\nThe silencing of speech squashes thought, opinion, and discussion, and\ndoing so, as Douglass pointed out\u2014consistent with other\nphilosophers on liberty\u2014commits a \u201ddouble wrong. It\nviolates the right of the hearer as well as those of the speaker\n (Ibid.).[14]\n\nOn property, Douglass argues, as expected, against human bondage.\nThat, however, was not the only thing he had to say about it. The\npositive right to property, the right of black Americans to their\nbodies, the labor of their bodies, and the wealth generated from their\nproductivity are ideas that feature prominently throughout the\nnarratives. Douglass wrote movingly about the productivity of his\nlabor, the exploitation of it by his enslavers and those in their\nemploy, the theft of his rightfully earned wages, and the anger of\nsome white laborers who resented having to work and compete with free\nblack workers. The right to self-ownership, labor, and property were\nnot just mere things denied to him\u2014they were expressions,\nproducts, and symbols of his liberty and liberty in general. In the\nNarrative, for example, on the theft of his wages by Hugh\nAuld, his master\u2019s brother, Douglass wrote,\n\n\nI was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day.\nI contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully\nmy own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to\ndeliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh. And why? Not because\nhe earned it,\u2014not because he had any hand in earning\nit,\u2014not because I owed it to him, nor because he possessed the\nslightest shadow of a right to it; but solely because he had the power\nto compel me to give it up. The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon\nthe high seas is exactly the same. (FDAB: 84)\n\n\nFrom the Civil War through Reconstruction and its betrayal, Douglass\ncontinued to see the right to property as a necessary part of genuine\nemancipation. He wrote and frequently spoke about the ennobling,\nmoral, and economic power of labor, private property, and individual\nproductivity in articles before emancipation like, \u201cWhat Shall\nbe Done with the Slave if Emancipated\u201d from 1862 (FDSW:\n470\u2013473) to speeches like \u201cSelf-Made Men\u201d from 1893\n(SFD: 414\u2013453).\n\nOn composite nationality, or what we would call multiethnic democracy,\nDouglass\u2019s \u201cOur Composite Nationality\u201d from 1869a\n(SFD: 278\u2013303) is a ringing endorsement of a robust vision of\ncivic belonging and national identification. It is an outlook that\nreflects his support for organic processes of assimilation and\namalgamation and social reform. More on that below\n (\u00a7\u00a76\u20138\n and\n \u00a712).\n\nJust as he drew on liberal ideas, he repeatedly invoked ideas of\nAmerican civic republicanism and advocated for democratic reform,\naction, and, eventually, universal suffrage\n (\u00a711).\n This democratic advocacy has led some philosophers to view Douglass\nas a civic republican as much as he was a liberal (Gooding-Williams\n2009). The evidence for that connection naturally arises from the wide\nvariety of his democratic associational activity. It is modeled in his\nnarratives, particularly in My Bondage and My Freedom, in its\ndepictions of social organization, action, solidarity, friendship, and\naffection among black men and women (FDAB: 305\u2013306).\n\nWhether we understand Douglass as a liberal or civic republican (or\neven as a type of black nationalist or black radical liberal), the\nvalues and ideas he drew on were the foundation of his fierce\ndenunciations of and active resistance to American slavery and his\ninterpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\n4. The U.S. Constitution\n\nIn 1851 Douglass broke from William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s position\nthat the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document and that the\nfree states should peacefully secede from the Union. In a letter to\nGerrit Smith, he reported that he was \u201csick and tired of arguing\non the slaveholder\u2019s side\u2026\u201d (21 January 1851 [FDSW:\n171\u2013173]). So, he decided to break with Garrison and side with\nSmith and the Liberty party\u2019s position that the United\nStates\u2019 founding documents were anti-slavery (Blight 1989:\n26\u201358; Root 2020).\n\nIn his famous speech on the topic, \u201cWhat To the Slave Is The\nFourth of July?\u201d (1852 [SFD: 55\u201392]), he detailed his\nsignature positions on the U.S. Constitution: that slavery is contrary\nto natural law, that blacks are self-evidently human and entitled to\nnatural rights, and that slavery is inconsistent with the\nConstitution, American Republicanism, and Christian doctrine, and that\nit should be\n forcefully\u2014violently\u2014resisted.[15]\n A principal example of this shift is the changes in his second\nautobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom (1855, FDAB);\nparticularly relevant is the extra and weighty meaning he imparts to\nthe famous scene of his fight with the slave breaker Covey\n (\u00a75).\n\nDouglass acknowledged that initially, he accepted the view, promoted\nby William Lloyd Garrison and allies aligned with him, that the\nframers intended to allow slavery to continue in the slave states and\nthat the Constitution was thereby consistent with the institution of\nslavery. However, the Garrisonian view of the Constitution resulted in\npassivity in the face of the Slave-holding states\u2019 threat of\nsuccession. That position did not sit well with Douglass because he\nwanted a more aggressive stance and strategy for abolishing slavery\nand the emancipation of the enslaved, including in the southern\nslave-holding states. Plus, he became convinced of the natural law\nreading of the U.S. Constitution that foregrounded the values outlined\nin the U.S. Declaration of Independence. What convinced him were the\narguments of Gerrit Smith, Lysander Spooner, William Goddell, and\nSamuel E. Sewall that the Constitution was an anti-slavery document\nand that the founders were at cross-purposes on the question of\nslavery. Douglass argued that the general ideas of America\u2019s\nfounding documents supported an interpretation of the U.S.\nConstitution as an evolving document in tune with the development of\ncivilization. Thus, he intoned the call, \u201clet there be\nlight\u201d, to capture his hope for abolition, emancipation, and\nuniversal political and social progress (1852 [SFD: 91]).\n\nDouglass\u2019s view of the Constitution is one of the reasons why he\nis associated with the assimilationist (or what is better understood\nas the integrationist tradition) tradition in African American\npolitical thought. It sets him up for the criticism that he did not\nsquarely recognize the racialized character of the nation, how deeply\nembedded race and racism were in its institutions, and that it was in\nmany respects a racial\n state.[16]\n Douglass, however, was not blithe to the nation\u2019s sins\u2014he\nrepeatedly and forcefully condemned them through the end of his life\n (\u00a712).\n His reading of the Constitution was reasonable, grounded in his\naffirmation of natural law theory, and it was an essential part of the\nhistory of abolition (Sinha 2016; Delbanco 2018).\n5. Violence and Self-Defense\n\nDouglass remained active in the years leading up to the U.S. Civil\nWar. He advocated for the abolition of slavery, worked against the\nexpansion of slavery into new U.S. territories, and vigorously\nprotested the Dred Scott decision and related laws that protected the\nproperty rights of slaveholders over slaves who escaped to the Free\nStates in the North.\n\nHe was a member of the Liberty party, was involved in other political\nparties, including the Radical and Free Soil parties, and eventually\nbecame involved with the Republican party\u2014all for the sake of\nabolition and the support of equal citizenship for all Americans\n(Blight 1989 and 2018). Douglass even met the militant abolitionist,\nJohn Brown. Although Douglass declined to join Brown\u2019s\nmilitia\u2014he sensed the deadly potential of Brown\u2019s zealotry\nand the likelihood of its failure\u2014he defended Brown\u2019s\nideals and denounced claims that Brown was merely mad. Although\nDouglass distanced himself from Brown\u2019s plans and destructive\nactions, he appropriated Brown as a symbol of righteous violence\nagainst the national sin of slavery and used the raid at\nHarper\u2019s Ferry to criticize President Lincoln\u2019s reluctance\nto support abolitionism (1859 [FDSW: 372\u2013376]; 1860b [FDSW:\n417\u2013421]; Myers 2008: 63\u201373; Blight 1989:\n95\u2013100).\n\nDouglass\u2019s rejection of pacifism and his support for Federal\nmilitary intervention to end slavery was a significant turning point\nin his thought about natural law, divine providence and manifest\ndestiny, and constitutional interpretation. Douglass\u2019s defense\nof jus ad Bellum greatly affected his contemporaries and the\nresulting debate on slavery, struggle, and self-respect. The modern\ndebate over violence and self-respect in African American philosophy,\ncritical race theory, and black political theory begins with\nDouglass\u2019s narratives, particularly his famous fight with the\n\u201cNegro breaker\u201d, Edward Covey. This incident plays a\nsignificant role in all of Douglass\u2019s narratives: Covey\nrepresents the brutalizing institution of American slavery, and\nDouglass\u2019s fight and victory represent the assertion of manhood,\nself-respect, dignity, and freedom. However, Douglass\u2019s time\nwith Covey and the suffering he endured by Covey\u2019s hand is given\na lengthier description in My Bondage and My Freedom than in\nthe Narrative. In the former, the depiction of the fight\nexplicitly draws parallels between Douglass\u2019s battle with Covey\nand the struggles of black Americans against slavery and racial\ndegradation.\n\nAdditionally, his fight has explicit national political connotations\n(Gooding-Williams 2009; Myers 2008). The scene\u2019s depiction in\neach autobiography is powerful and indicates its narrative brilliance\n(literary, rhetorical, and philosophical), so it deserves to be quoted\nat length. In the Narrative (1845), Douglass wrote:\n\n\nThe battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a\nslave. It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived\nwithin me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed\nself-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be\nfree. The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full\ncompensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. He\nonly can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has\nhimself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never\nfelt before. It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery,\nto the heaven of freedom. My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice\ndeparted, bold defiance took its place; and I now resolved that,\nhowever long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed\nforever when I could be a slave in fact. I did not hesitate to let it\nbe known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in\nwhipping, must also succeed in killing me. (FDAB: 65)\n\n\nIn My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he gives the following\nexpanded interpretation:\n\n\nWell, my dear reader, this battle with Mr. Covey,\u2014undignified as\nit was, and as I fear my narration of it is\u2014was the turning\npoint in my \u201clife as a slave\u201d. It rekindled in my\nbreast the smouldering embers of liberty; it brought up my Baltimore\ndreams, and revived a sense of my own manhood. I was a changed being\nafter that fight. I was nothing before; I WAS A MAN NOW. It\nrecalled to life my crushed self-respect and my self-confidence, and\ninspired me with a renewed determination to be a FREEMAN. A man,\nwithout force, is without the essential dignity of humanity. Human\nnature is so constituted, that it cannot honor a helpless\nman, although it can pity him; and even this it cannot do\nlong, if the signs of power do not arise. (FDAB: 286, original\nemphases)\n\n\nThe first passage displays Douglass\u2019s romantic and religious\ninfluences; it swells with the longing for the freedom of the soul.\nThe second passage, written without the demands of Garrison\u2019s\npacifist politics directing his pen, screams independence and force.\nIt recommends violence\u2014it advocates for the coming U.S. Civil\nWar\u2014to throw off tyranny and claim, defend, and even fulfill\none\u2019s honor and humanity.\n6. Respect and Dignity\n\nThe fight with Covey has inspired several philosophical\ninterpretations of Douglass\u2019s intentions and the meaning of his\nstruggle. It is commonly read as an exemplar of the conception of the\nstate of war within liberal political theory (Davis 1971) and the\ninterpersonal, or generally relational, dynamics of respect and\n recognition.[17]\n In particular, Bernard Boxill (1997 and 1998) developed an\nexceptionally influential deontological account of Douglass\u2019s\nfight as emblematic of the individual sense of self-respect of oneself\nas a moral\n being.[18]\n That self-recognition comes with the obligation to defend one\u2019s\nself-respect and to expect respect from others, which implies that\nothers should recognize one\u2019s inherent dignity. For\nDouglass, that fight was a parable\u2014like Jacob\u2019s wrestling\nwith an angel (Genesis 32:24\u201332\n [KJV]),[19]\n except in this case, the antagonist was more demonic than\nangelic\u2014about the American and black American fight against\nslavery and racism.\n\nWhat is more, Douglass\u2019s evocation of dignity in his narrative\nof the fight is intellectually and emotionally stunning. \u201cA man,\nwithout force\u201d, he intensely asserted, \u201cis without the\nessential dignity of humanity\u201d. He adds to that the claim\nthat\n\n\n[h]uman nature is so constituted, that it cannot honor a\nhelpless man, although it can pity him; and even this it\ncannot do long, if the signs of power do not arise. (FDAB, 286,\noriginal emphases)\n\n\nThe moral weightiness of the idea of dignity and his use of it invites\nus to consider whether it plays a special role in his thought and its\nrelation to his frequently repeated arguments and assertions of the\nhumanity and equal moral personhood of black people. Most of his\nmentions of dignity in his speeches and writings primarily refer to it\nas an ordinary sense of respectful comportment and propriety.\nNonetheless, everyday assertions of dignity, even passive ones, have\nmorally serious implications for individuals, groups, and societies\nunder conditions of absolute domination, such as faced by black\nAmericans during slavery and Jim Crow segregation. Assertions of\neveryday dignity could often be met with severe and sometimes violent\nconsequences under those conditions\u2014a fact that Douglass\nhighlighted and condemned throughout his life. When Douglass referred\nto moral personhood as such (the essential moral worth of persons), he\ntypically used the ideas of \u201cequality\u201d, \u201cperfect\nhuman equality\u201d, \u201cmanhood\u201d,\n\u201cbrotherhood\u201d, and \u201cuniversal human\nbrotherhood\u201d.\n\nThere are, however, moments, as noted in the passage above from My\nBondage and My Freedom, where his usage of \u201cdignity\u201d\nexplicitly points to the idea of equal moral personhood.\n\nThe same is true in an editorial he wrote in 1850 responding to\nslander, verbal assaults, and a physical one:\n\n\nMy crime is, that I have assumed to be a man, entitled to all the\nrights, privileges and dignity, which belong to human\nnature\u2014that color is no crime, and that all men are\nbrother. I have acted on this presumption. The very\n\u201chead and front of my offending hath this extent\u2014no\nmore\u201d. I have not merely talked of human brotherhood and\nhuman equality, but have reduced that talk to practice. This I\nhave done in broad open day, scorning concealment. I have walked\nthrough the streets of New York, in company with white persons, not as\na menial, but as an equal. (1850 [FDSW: 157]; my emphases)\n\n\nAs discussed in the previous sections on slavery, natural law,\nliberty, the U.S. Constitution, and self-defense, Douglass vigorously\ndefended equal personhood and thus the moral equality of black people.\nOn that basis, he condemned slavery as an affront to natural law,\nChristianity, and republicanism. Therefore, regardless of the\nfrequency he referred to the term \u201cdignity\u201d, he does get\nat the idea, and it does play a central role (along with and\ndefined through the constellation of other ideas he drew on)\nin his political philosophical thought. Perhaps then, a basic account\nof dignity, as indicative of individual moral worth, is all that is\nneeded to understand Douglass\u2019s view. Stopping with that,\nhowever, would impart a sense of passivity to it. Douglass\u2019s\nview was not simply static.\n\nDignity, for Douglass, is a natural and innate thing, bequeathed to\nall humans as humans. It is static or changeless in that limited\nsense. At the same time, Douglass suggests that willful action,\nepitomized by self-defense, was a condition of what was otherwise an\ninherent and essential quality of being a human person. It is\nsomething to be\n practiced.[20]\n But if dignity is innate and inherent, why must an individual\npractice it for it to be said that they have it? If it is an essential\nquality, then its practice or expression cannot be a condition of its\npossession. Douglass is not equivocating on this point. An\nindividual\u2019s equal moral status comes with the obligation to\ninhabit, abide by, and defend that\n status.[21]\n This is how we should understand Douglass\u2019s view of dignity as\nmodeled by his open-air rejection of servility and assertion of\nequality.\n\nAll the same, Douglass does not, nor could he, consistently hold that\nevery enslaved black person needed to have an equivalent \u201cfight\nwith Covey\u201d moment and assertion of \u201cmanhood\u201d to\nsecure their dignity and natural right to be treated as a moral equal.\nDirectly related to this concern is the continuing discussion of\nwhether the depiction of the fight with Covey and its meaning and\nvalue promote a masculinist vision of anti-slavery resistance,\nliberty, and autonomy (Wallace 2009 and 2014; Alfaro 2018). Douglass\ndid not think that the attitudes and actions of the enslaved\nconditioned the immorality of slavery and the imperative of\nemancipation, so what counts as resistance to indignities of injustice\nrequires careful and charitable consideration that is attentive to the\nconstraints of individual circumstances and social conditions.\n\nThe bravado in Douglass\u2019s wonderful affront to racism aside, his\nvision of self-respect, dignity, and the obligation to defend oneself\nand one\u2019s dignity is central to his legacy. It plays a vital\nrole in the history of African American political theory, and for that\nreason, given this nation\u2019s history, it is a valuable\ncontribution to American political philosophy about respect, dignity,\nand personhood. Its implications are profound, as can be seen in his\nview of universal human brotherhood.\n7. Universal Human Brotherhood\n\nDouglass\u2019s conception of providence, with its American themes of\nindividualism, anti-supernaturalism, and activism, and his view of\nnatural law influenced his understanding of universal human\nbrotherhood (Sundstrom 2003 and 2008: 11\u201335). He believed that\nthe idea of universal human brotherhood was consistent with the high\nideals of American Republicanism and Christianity. It was a doctrine\ndearly held by Douglass, and he offered it as a response to the rise\nin the United States of Samuel Morton\u2019s (1799\u20131851) racial\ntheory of polygenesis, that Josiah Nott and George\nGliddon\u2019s Types of Mankind (1854) popularized (Martin\n1984; Myers 2008).\n\nDouglass put considerable effort into countering arguments that blacks\nwere subhuman, intellectually and morally inferior, and fit to be\ndominated as children, forever to be a race in nonage. To counter\nthese claims, he turned to his natural law arguments. He argued that\nby the standards of Christian theology, blacks, as humans and\ncreations of the divine, were all equally the children of God, no\nmatter their present condition. One of his slogans, drawn directly\nfrom the title of a poem by the Scottish poet Robert Burns, got to the\npoint: \u201cA man\u2019s a man for a\u2019 that\u201d\n (1795).[22]\n Douglass argued that the Christian Bible had to be correct on this\nscore, that the authority of the biblical text relied on the\naffirmation of the unity of the human family:\n\n\nWhat, after all, if they are able to show very good reasons for\nbelieving the Negro to have been created precisely as we find him on\nthe Gold Coast\u2014along the Senegal and the Niger\u2014I say, what\nof all this?\u2014\u201cA man\u2019s a man for a\u2019\nthat\u201d. I sincerely believe, that the weight of the argument\nis in favor of the unity of origin of the human race, or\nspecies\u2014that the arguments on the other side are partial,\nsuperficial, utterly subversive of the happiness of man, and insulting\nto the wisdom of God. Yet, what if we grant they are not so? What, if\nwe grant that the case, on our part, is not made out? Does it follow,\nthat the Negro should be held in contempt? Does it follow, that to\nenslave and imbrue him is either just or wise? I\nthink not. Human rights stand upon a common basis; and by all the\nreason that they are supported, maintained and defended, for one\nvariety of the human family, they are supported, maintained and\ndefended for all the human family; because all mankind have\nthe same wants, arising out of a common nature. A diverse origin does\nnot disprove a common nature, nor does it disprove a united destiny.\n(1854 [SFD: 147] [FDP1 v.2: 523])\n\n\nHe emphasized that not only was slavery against natural law and\nChristian morality but that the very arguments concerning the subhuman\nstatus of blacks that slavery\u2019s apologists used to justify\nattempted slavery contradicted the Bible and were heretical. Douglass,\nin short, leveraged the Bible and America\u2019s reverence for it\nagainst the rising tide of polygenesis race theory. He stated:\n\n\nThe unity of the human race\u2014the brotherhood of man\u2014the\nreciprocal duties of all to each, and of each to all, are too plainly\ntaught in the Bible to admit of cavil.\u2014The credit of the Bible\nis at stake\u2014and if it be too much to say, that it must stand or\nfall, by the decision of this question, it is proper to say,\nthat the value of that sacred Book\u2014as a record of the early\nhistory of mankind\u2014must be materially affected, by the decision\nof the question. (1854 [SFD: 126] [FDP1 v.2: 505])\n\n\nThe doctrine of universal human brotherhood for Douglass, and the\nabolitionists, was based on the Bible\u2019s creation story and Acts\n17:26 [KJV]: \u201cAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men for\nto dwell on all the face of the earth\u201d.\n\nThese words were not mere words for Douglass and the abolitionists;\nthey were not just-so stories. The Christian doctrine of the unity of\nthe human family or human brotherhood contained the world-historical\ninsight of equal human dignity, which implied\u2014unleashed, as seen\nin several revolutions in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies\u2014an uncompromising demand for moral equality and equal\nliberty.\n8. Amalgamation and Assimilation\n\nDouglass\u2019s affirmation of universal human brotherhood, his\nbelief in providential human development, and his observation of the\nmixing of racialized groups in the United States led him to directly\nsupport racial amalgamation: race-mixing was a sign of progress for\nFrederick Douglass. It is important to note here that he thought there\nwere races to amalgamate, so he affirmed the basic idea that\nbiologically distinct races existed (1854 [SFD: 116\u2013150]). As\nhis view of universal human brotherhood should be clear, he did not\nthink much followed from that admission. The existence of biological\nraces did not, in his view, negate the theological-philosophical\ninsight of universal human brotherhood.\n\nDouglass understood that the sexual boundaries between the races were\nthin and that, indeed, the conditions of slavery led to a great deal\nof mixing. Recall that he maintained that his unacknowledged father\nwas his white master, and, in no uncertain terms, he condemned the\nrape, sexual violence, and exploitation of black women. Yet, given his\ncommitment to his ideals, Douglass promoted amalgamation between free\npeoples. He believed that blacks and white ought to be free to\nintermarry and that they should do so. Why should they marry?\nDouglass, sensing the transformation of the black and Native American\npopulation in the United States, believed this process was a natural\nand continual process; that a new third race, an American race, would\nemerge in this land. During his time, such views were highly\ninflammatory and served, and continued to serve, as a reason against\nthe emancipation of enslaved black people and later as a justification\nfor segregation (Sundstrom 2008: 11\u201335). Nonetheless, in the\n1860s, he boldly advocated for amalgamation between the races. He\nremarked to a journalist, the day after his second marriage to Helen\nPitts, who was white,\n\n\n\u2026there is no division of races. God Almighty made but one race.\nI adopt the theory that in time the varieties of races will be blended\ninto one. Let us look back when the black and the white people were\ndistinct in this country. In two hundred and fifty years there has\ngrown up a million of intermediate. And this will continue. You may\nsay that Frederick Douglass considers himself a member of the one race\nwhich exists. (1884 [FDP1 v.5: 147])\n\n\nDouglass\u2019s amalgamation is easy to confuse with his support for\nassimilation. Amalgamation is conceptually distinct from assimilation;\none does not have to accept amalgamation to support assimilation.\nAssimilation concerns various degrees of acculturation. It can\ntheoretically go in either direction, from black to white or white to\nblack, and it can involve the subtle blending of both and many groups\n(Sundstrom 2008). His support for amalgamation and assimilation could\nnot be any clearer than what he proclaimed in \u201cOn Composite\nNationality\u201d, in which he called for the molding of all\nin the land into a common Americanness (1869a [SFD: 278\u2013303];\n \u00a712).\n In his enthusiasm for this molding, he is distinct, but he was not\nexceptional in his support of assimilation; several of his\ncontemporaries and leaders who followed him supported some degree of\nassimilation. Even some of Douglass\u2019s early critics, such as\nEdward Blyden (1832\u20131912), Martin Delany (1812\u20131885), and\nAlexander Crummell (1819\u20131898), who did not support\namalgamation, still believed in the assimilation of black Americans to\nthe standards and values Western civilization (Moses 1978).\n9. Integration versus Emigration\n\nDouglas advocated assimilation and amalgamation, so, understandably,\nhe supported the right of black Americans to remain in the United\nStates and thought they ought to do so. Rather than leave the country\nto find homes and start lives abroad in places that they imagined\nmight provide friendlier quarters, Douglass urged black Americans to\nstay and support abolition efforts and then, in the postbellum years,\nto fight for equal rights and citizenship. He can be considered a\nprimary example of the political ideal of racial integration as\ndistinct from racial separatism. Douglass\u2019s\namalgamation-assimilationist views of the 1860s are not the\ndesegregationist and integrationist ideas associated with the U.S.\nCivil Rights movement that began around the mid-1950s. Other thinkers\nand movements influenced those views, which advocated for equal\nrights, protection, citizenship, and equal access to schools, colleges\nand universities, and neighborhoods. Yet, Douglass is a fitting icon\nfor the American integrationist impulse.\n\nIn his essay from 1848, \u201cThe Folly of Racially Exclusive\nOrganization\u201d, Douglass criticized the creation of separate\nsocieties, with distinct \u201cnegro pews, negro berths in\nsteamboats, negro cars, Sabbath or week-day schools or\nchurches\u201d, and in other social spaces and institutions (FDP1\nv.2: 110\u2013111). Formal racial segregation and informal separatism\ngenerally served the interests of the defenders of slavery; thus,\nafter the U.S. Civil War, Douglass regarded ongoing racial separatism\nas a counter to the ideals of the abolition movement. It was a message\nhe frequently repeated (1848a [FDSW: 117\u2013122]).\n\nHe opposed plans for black American emigration to Africa, the\nCaribbean, Mexico, or Latin America for similar reasons. He criticized\nthe emigrationist visions of the American Colonization Society,\nfounded by whites, and the African Civilization Society, founded by\nblacks. He had four reasons to oppose emigration schemes: First, for\nslavery to end, Douglass argued that black Americans needed to\nstruggle against it in America. Second, Americans had no other home\nbut the United States; they were uniquely American and products of\nAmerican history. Third, black Americans had a right to the property\ntheir labor had produced. By abandoning the United States, they would\nleave the land they had built. In his 1894 speech, \u201cLessons of\nthe Hour\u201d (SFD: 454\u2013497), he wrote,\n\n\nThe native land of the American Negro in America. His bones, his\nmuscles, his sinews, are all American. His ancestors for two hundred\nand seventy years have lived and laboured and died, on American soil,\nand millions of his posterity have inherited Caucasian blood. It is\ncompetent, therefore, to ask, in view of this admixture, as well as in\nview of other facts, where the people of this mixed-race are to go,\nfor their ancestors are white and black, and it will be difficult to\nfind their native land anywhere outside of the United States. (1894\n[SFD: 485]).\n\n\nFourth, according to Douglass, emigration and separation were contrary\nto historical development and the emergence of a composite nation\ncomprised of a blended people. All the same, Douglass was not opposed\nto blacks collectively acting in self-help and self-defense.\nNonetheless, his opposition to emigration displayed a downside of his\ncommitment to his natural law and manifest destiny-inspired\nprinciples. He did not appreciate enough how immigration might be more\nthan a reasonable act of self-preservation and\nself-determination\u2014in the face of anti-black life-crushing\noppression and murderous violence\u2014much like his own escape from\n slavery.[23]\n Initially, Douglass even opposed the internal migration of black\nAmericans from the southern states to the northern ones (Myers 2008).\nHowever, he moderated his position nearer the end of his life (1879\n[FDP1 v.4: 510\u2013533]; 357 [FDP1 v.5: 357\u2013373]); 1894 [SFD:\n454\u2013497]).\n10. Leadership\n\nDouglass was a leader among the Americans involved in the abolition\nmovement, and after the Civil War, although unelected into any office,\nhe remained a leading voice for black\n Americans.[24]\n Garrison presented Douglass as a victim of and witness to slavery and\nas a spokesperson for Garrisonian abolitionism, but he freed himself\nfrom their restraints, just as he freed himself from slavery. To speak\nfor himself, be his own man, and be a leader among men. That is what\nDouglass wanted. Thus, he shaped his own story, insisted on speaking\nhis mind free from the control of handlers like Garrison, and strove\nto represent the interests of black Americans.\n\nHis example of leadership was quick to be seized and claimed by other\nprospective black leaders and spokespersons. The most significant\nexample of this was the conflicting claim between W.E.B. Du Bois and\nBooker T. Washington (1856\u20131915) over Douglass\u2019s legacy.\nBoth men competed for the opportunity to publish a biography of\nDouglass with the publishers George W. Jacobs & Company in their\nseries The American Crisis Biographies (Sundstrom 2008:\n11\u201335). The press rejected Du Bois\u2019s bid for this task in\nfavor of Washington\u2019s (1907) and granted Du Bois the project of\nwriting a biography of John Brown instead\u2014but he included within\nit an extensive discussion on Douglass (Du Bois 1909).\n\nAfter the death of Douglass, Du Bois penned an unpublished\nelegiac poem, \u201cThe Passing of Douglass\u201d (Du Bois 1999:\nix), and he incorporated elements of Douglass\u2019s narrative in\nThe Souls of Black Folk (1903 [1999: xxii]), John\nBrown (1909), and Black Reconstruction in America (1935\n[2021]). Du Bois presented Douglass as a self-assertive freedom\nfighter and a leader of an activist community that demanded full\nsocial and political liberty, equality, and inclusion. Du Bois\u2019s\nDouglass was not an accommodationist: He was not the sort of black\nleader who paid obeisance to white leaders and consented to an\noppressive status quo, all for a token pittance or\nself-aggrandizement. Du Bois made this pointed interpretation very\nclear in his The Souls of Black Folks. In the third chapter\n(\u201cOf Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\u201d) of\nSouls, Du Bois argues against Booker T. Washington\u2019s\naccommodationism in favor of his and Douglass\u2019s demand for, and\nassertion of, black political and social equality and rights. Economic\nliberty is not enough, and any gains in the economic sphere would be\nhampered and vulnerable without the protections and opportunities\nprovided by social and political liberty and rights. And, of course,\neconomic considerations aside, the fight for equal rights and liberty\nis not solely about economic opportunity\u2014it is about equal\ndignity and one\u2019s full humanity.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Du Bois took on Douglass\u2019s\nmantle of leadership after he argued against Douglass\u2019s view of\nassimilation and amalgamation. In \u201cThe Conservation of\nRaces\u201d, Du Bois rejected amalgamation, which Douglass supported,\nand advocated for conserving a distinct black identity and community\n(1897 [1992]). Here is his critical reduction of the amalgamation\nposition:\n\n\nIt may, however, be objected here that the situation of our race in\nAmerica renders this attitude impossible; that our sole hope of\nsalvation lies in our being able to lose our race identity in the\ncommingled blood of the nation; and that nay other course would merely\nincrease the friction of races which we call race prejudice, and\nagainst which we have so long and so earnestly fought. (Du Bois 1897\n[1992: 488])\n\n\nDu Bois, in opposition to amalgamation, argued that black Americans\nought to embrace a \u201cstalwart originality\u201d that follows\n\u201cNegro Ideals\u201d and not dissolve into a general American\nidentity (Ibid.). It is a view associated with cultural pluralism that\nexpresses an early version of black cultural nationalism. And as such,\nit is a historical conceptual landmark in debates in African social\nand political thought over racial separation versus assimilation and\nthe conservation of race (Boxill 1992a: 173\u201385; 1992b; 1999;\nMcGary 1999a; 1999b: 43\u201361; Pittman\n 1999).[25]\n\nBecause of his cultural pluralism, it is tempting to think that Du\nBois rejected Douglass\u2019s view of assimilation and integration,\nbut that would be a mistake. He turned away from Douglass\u2019s\nvision of total assimilation in favor of retaining some black ideals,\nwhich he too quickly assumed that all blacks qua blacks share. Still,\nhis cultural pluralism has at its end the creation of a community that\nis a \u201cco-worker\u201d in the \u201ckingdom of culture\u201d\n(Du Bois 1903 [1999: 11]). What results from Du Bois\u2019s rejection\nof amalgamation and acceptance of some elements of assimilation is the\nbrilliant idea of double consciousness, especially the double\nconsciousness brought on by the black American experience. As is\nevident from the rhetorical questions at the end of the following\npassage, Du Bois argued against Douglass\u2019s hopes of amalgamation\nand presaged his view of black political, social, and cultural\nsolidarity:\n\n\nNo Negro who has given earnest thought to the situation of his people\nin America has failed, at some time in life, to find himself at these\ncross-roads; has failed to ask himself at some time: What, after all,\nam I? Am I an American or am I a Negro? Can I be both? Or is it my\nduty to cease to be a Negro as soon as possible and be an American? If\nI strive as a Negro, am I not perpetuating the very cleft that\nthreatens and separates Black and White America? Is not my only\npossible aim the subduction of all that is Negro in me to the\nAmerican? Does my black blood place upon me any more obligation to\nassert my nationality than German, or Irish or Italian blood would?\n(Du Bois 1897 [1992: 488])\n\n\nDu Bois\u2019s answers to these questions directly contradict\nDouglass\u2019s view about amalgamation. However, their opinions\nabout assimilation share similarities, such as the co-production and\nenjoyment of a shared American culture. In the end, however, Du\nBois\u2019s image of Douglass is skewed toward his political projects\nof elite leadership, racial solidarity, and uplift.\n\nLikewise, Booker T. Washington\u2019s Douglass is equally a work of\nart that reflects the artist\u2019s image. His The Life of\nFrederick Douglass (1907) presents a picture of Douglass contrary\nto Du Bois\u2019s and is incompatible with many of Douglass\u2019s\nviews. It is, in part, a work of self-promotion. Although Washington\naccurately pointed out the similarities between Douglass and himself,\nhe failed to mention Douglass\u2019s assertions of equal personhood,\nhis uncompromising demands for equal social and political rights, and\nthat Douglass fully expected that black Americans would fully\nintegrate into a \u201ccomposite nation\u201d. Washington\u2019s\nclaim over Douglass\u2019s legacy of leadership falls short of the\nfacts. Douglass was a radical Republican and demanded full inclusion\nof black Americans in the nation\u2019s life and the opening of all\nopportunities for education and advancement for blacks, and Washington\ndid not.\n\nDu Bois\u2019s claims over Douglass, however, also fall short.\nDespite Du Bois\u2019s assumption that he had inherited the mantle of\nblack political, social, and (he would add) cultural leadership from\nDouglass, Douglass\u2019s leadership style and politics were markedly\nmore democratic than Du Bois\u2019s. Although Douglass likely saw\nhimself as an instance of what Ralph Waldo Emerson called a\n\u201crepresentative man\u201d (Emerson 1850 [2004]) and as a\nself-made man to boot (1893 [SFD: 414\u2013453]; 1860d [FDP1 v.3:\n289\u2013300]), he did not envision himself as the embodiment of the\nspirit or culture of his people Gooding-Williams 2009:\n19\u201365).\n\nDouglass\u2019s political activities provide a model of democratic\npolitics in action (Gooding-Williams 2009). He worked with various\ngroups, some underground, while he was enslaved. For example,\nunbeknownst to his master, he participated in at least one Sabbath\nSchool and helped other slaves learn to read and write. And, of\ncourse, he worked with several other black and racially integrated\nadvocacy groups after his escape and emancipation. These groups had\ncross-cutting interests that he had to navigate. He pushed them to\nreach a consensus on different issues, such as in his work with the\nAmerican Equal Rights Association, an organization devoted to\nuniversal suffrage. So, he did not pose as a singular spokesman for\nmovements, groups, or his race, although he never shied away from\npushing or arguing his opinions and promoting democratic action (1848\n[FDSW: 117\u2013122]).\n\nIndeed, his liberal and civic republican ideas influenced his thoughts\nabout leadership and his vision of the work and role of\n\u201cheroes\u201d and so-called \u201crepresentative men\u201d\n(1883b [SFD: 374\u2013400]; 1893 [SFD: 414\u2013453]; 1860d [FDP1\nv.3: 289\u2013300]). For Douglass, they were invaluable in their\nstance against tyranny and defense of equal rights and liberty. On\nJohn Brown, for example, Douglass wrote, putting him into heroic terms\n(with overtones of Thomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson),\n\n\nHe believes the Declaration of Independence to be true, and the Bible\nto be a guide to human conduct, and acting upon the doctrines of both,\nhe threw himself against the serried ranks of American oppression, and\ntranslated into heroic deeds the love of liberty and hatred of\ntyrants, with which he was inspired from both these forces acting upon\nhis philanthropic and heroic soul. (1859 [FDSW: 375])\n\n\nThus, in his elegies to John Brown and Abraham Lincoln, we see the\nvalue he places on Emersonian representative men and the ideal of the\nstatesman guided by liberal and civic republican principles (1859\n[FDSW: 372\u2013376]; 1860b [FDSW: 417\u2013421]; 1876 [FDSW:\n616\u2013624]).\n11. Women\u2019s Suffrage\n\nAfter the Civil War, Douglass remained active in Republican Party. He\nwas a staunch supporter of uncompromising Reconstruction of the Union\nand advocated for economic and education investment in free and\nnewly-freed black Americans. Douglass pressed for the expansion of and\nguarantee of civil rights for blacks, particularly for the defense of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875, which the Supreme Court declared\nunconstitutional in 1883 (1883a [FDSW: 685\u2013693]). Additionally,\nin keeping with his civil rights efforts and his view of natural\nrights and the development of the United States into a just Republic,\nhe was an advocate, although a complicated one, of women\u2019s\nsuffrage (Douglass 1976). He joined other prominent leaders in the\nabolition movement, such as Sojourner Truth, and emerging leaders in\nthe suffrage movement, such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady\nStanton, in these efforts.\n\nThe American Equal Rights Association was the principal national\norganization working on behalf of women\u2019s right to vote. At\nleast in rhetoric, it had a dual platform of racial and sexual\nequality (DuBois 1978). Middle-class and wealthy white women primarily\nled it, and Douglass supported its platform but clashed with its\nleaders over conflicting interests and its latent racism. The tensions\nwithin the American Equal Rights Association, and the suffrage\nmovement generally, erupted over the passing of the fifteenth\namendment to the U.S. Constitution. The fifteenth amendment franchised\nall male citizens, although, as U.S. history so brutally revealed, it\ndid so in word but not in deed. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.\nAnthony opposed the fifteenth amendment because they demanded that\nblack men and all women (particularly white women) should be\nenfranchised simultaneously. Some within the suffrage movement based\ntheir arguments for women\u2019s suffrage and against blacks\u2019\nenfranchisement on racist grounds. Although the white women who led\nthe association were abolitionists, they also, and not\ninconsequentially, held that blacks, particularly black men, were\ninferior to white women and neither as ready for nor deserving of the\nvote as they were (Stanton 1868 [2000: 194\u2013199] and 1869 [2000:\n236\u2013238]).\n\nDouglass was sympathetic to the cause of the universal franchise;\nhowever, he condemned arguments for women\u2019s suffrage that were\npredicated on the supposed racial superiority of white women. He\nroundly condemned Stanton\u2019s racist claims that black and\n\u201cOriental\u201d men, and by extension black and Asian\nwomen\u2014i.e., Stanton\u2019s nasty references to\n\u201cSambo\u201d and \u201cYung Tung\u201d\u2014were not as\ndeserving as white women (1869b [FDP1 v.4: 213\u2013219]; Stanton\n1868 [2000: 194\u2013199]). Douglass did not want to delay the\nfranchise for black males to resolve the question of women\u2019s\nright to vote. He believed it a practical matter to quickly get some\nprotections for black Americans while the fight for suffrage for black\nand white women continued. Moreover, he argued it was imperative to\nobtain some measure of blacks\u2019 political, legal, and social\nrights to confront the rising level of horrific anti-black violence\nsweeping the United States. Douglass firmly made this claim in his\nspeech at an American Equal Rights Association meeting in 1869:\n\n\nI must say that I do not see how any one can pretend that there is the\nsame urgency in giving the ballot to women as to the negro. With us,\nthe matter is a question of life and death. It is a matter of\nexistence, at least in fifteen states of the Union. When women,\nbecause they are women, are hunted down through the cities of New York\nand New Orleans; when they are dragged from their houses and hung upon\nlamp-posts; when their children are torn from their arms, and their\nbrains dashed out upon the pavement; when they are objects of insult\nand outrage at every turn; when they are in danger of having their\nhomes burnt down over their heads; when their children are not allowed\nto enter schools; then they will have an urgency to obtain the ballot\nequal to our own. (1869b [FDP1 v.4: 216] [SFD: 271])\n\n\nWhen asked if this did not apply to black women, Douglass replied that\nit did, but because they were black and not women (Ibid.). He did not\nhave ready answers, however, to concerns about how well black men,\nincluding elite black men, represented and protected the rights and\ninterests of black women. Generations of black male leaders repeated\nhis shortsightedness, which black women leaders, like Anna Julia\nCooper (c. 1859\u20131964), criticized while also struggling against\nthe racism of first-wave feminism (Cooper 1998).\n12. At the Dawn of Jim Crow\n\nDuring and after the Reconstruction, Douglass remained deeply\nconcerned about the prospect that the U.S. would compromise on black\nAmericans\u2019 civil and human rights. He became increasingly\nworried about the denial of black civil rights and the rising waves of\nanti-black violence and criticized the growing practice of black\npeonage in agriculture. And over time, his sympathy for black\nindividuals and families fleeing the American South grew. He did not\nsupport internal mass migration as a policy because he judged it a\npoor option for black labor since it did not address the institutional\nproblems that caused the flight: peonage and exploitation, unequal\njustice, unrestrained violence, lack of resources and opportunities,\nand in particular, education. For taking that position, Douglass\nreceived a great deal of criticism for failing to support the\nindividual choices of black Americans who sought to flee the\ninhospitable, degrading, and deadly conditions in the American South.\nIt compelled him to rethink his views on the question\n (\u00a79).\n\nRelated to the conditions causing the flight of black Americans from\nthe southern states, Douglass criticized the inequitable and unfair\ntreatment of blacks in state criminal justice systems, particularly\ncriticizing the Convict-Lease system (Davis 1999). And he joined with\nIda B. Wells-Barnett (1862\u20131931) in raising the alarm over the\ngrowing practice of anti-black lynching in the United States (Giddings\n2008; Wells-Barnett et al. 2014). Douglass saw America\u2019s failure\nto support civil rights and equal citizenship for black Americans as\nindicative of its moral and political failure. He even went so far as\nto provocatively claim that emancipation was a stupendous fraud (1888a\n[FDSW: 712\u2013724]).\n\nDouglass\u2019s later-day activities are an essential part of his\nrecord and life; indeed, they are a part of the evolving discussions\non various subjects in African American philosophy, political theory,\nand critical theories in several disciplines. He was part of several\nmovements that helped to mold the nation; they took their confidence\nin providential historical development in hand\u2014as he did when he\nfirst committed to seizing his liberty in his \u201csoul\u2019s\ncomplaint\u201d, an \u201capostrophe\u201d to ships on the\nChesapeake Bay:\n\n\nYou are loosed from your mooring, and are free; I am fast in my\nchains, and am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I\nsadly before the bloody whip! You are freedom\u2019s swift-winged\nangels, that fly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O\nthat I were free! O, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and\nunder your protecting wing! Alas! Betwixt me and you, the turbid\nwaters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim!\nIf I could fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute! The\nglad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in the\nhottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let\nme be free! Is there any God? Why am I a slave? (1845 [FDAB: 59])\n\n\nThe historian David Blight called Douglass a prophet of freedom,\nperfectly capturing Douglass\u2019s enduring appeal (2018). His\nideas, values, and rhetoric defending equal liberty continue to cry\nout to us in celebration and defense of equality and liberty. There is\nno better summation of all that he stood for than what he proclaimed\nin 1869 at the end of \u201cOn Composite Nationality\u201d:\n\n\nIf our action shall be in accordance with the principles of justice,\nliberty, and perfect human equality, no eloquence can adequately\nportray the greatness and grandeur of the Republic. We shall spread\nthe network of our science and our civilization over all who seek\ntheir shelter, whether from Asia, Africa, or the Isles of the Sea. We\nshall mould them all, each after his kind, into Americans; Indian and\nCelt, negro and Saxon, Latin and Teuton, Mongolian and Caucasian, Jew\nand gentile, all shall bow to the same law, speak the same language,\nsupport the same government, enjoy the same liberty, vibrate with the\nsame national enthusiasm, and seek the same national ends. (1869 [SFD:\n302\u2013303])\n\n\nThose inspiring and challenging words stand as an invitation to us to\nclosely study Douglass\u2019s works and legacy and to achieve our\nnation.\n",
