    "main_text": "The Ten-Fold Division || General Discussion\n2.1 General Discussion\n\nAfter providing his first system of classification, Aristotle turns to\nthe predicamenta and presents a second, which ends up\noccupying him for much of the remainder of the Categories.\nAristotle divides what he calls ta legomena (\u03c4\u1f03\n\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1), i.e.\nthings that are said, into ten distinct kinds (1b25). Things\nthat are said according to Aristotle, are words (De Int\n16a3), and so it is natural to interpret his second system as a\nclassification of words. And because the English word\n\u2018category\u2019 comes from the Greek word for\npredicate, one might naturally think of the second system as\na classification of distinct types of linguistic predicates. There is,\nhowever, considerable debate about the subject matter of the second\nsystem of classification.\n\nThere are three reasons to think that Aristotle is not primarily\ninterested in words but rather in the objects in the world to which\nwords correspond. First, his locution ta legomena is in fact\nambiguous, as between \u2018things said\u2019\u2014where these\nmight or might not be words\u2014and \u2018things spoken\nof\u2019\u2014where these are more naturally taken to be things\nreferred to by means of words. Second, Aristotle\u2019s examples of\nitems belonging to the various categories are generally\nextra-linguistic. For instance, his examples of substances are an\nindividual man and a horse. Third, Aristotle explicitly accepts a\ndoctrine of meaning according to which words conventionally signify\nconcepts, and concepts naturally signify objects in the world (De\nInt 16a3). So, even if he is in some sense classifying words, it\nis natural to view his classification as ultimately driven by concerns\nabout objects in the world to which our words correspond.\n\nThose scholars dissatisfied with the linguistic interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s second system of classification have moved in one of\nseveral directions. Some have interpreted Aristotle as classifying\nconcepts. The objections raised against the linguistic interpretation,\nhowever, can again be raised against the concept interpretation as\nwell. Other scholars have interpreted Aristotle as classifying\nextra-linguistic and extra-conceptual reality. Finally, some scholars\nhave synthesized the linguistic and extra-linguistic interpretations\nby interpreting Aristotle as classifying linguistic predicates in\nso far as they are related to the world in semantically\nsignificant ways. Although I think that this latter interpretation is\nprobably the one that best withstands close textual scrutiny, the\ngeneral character of the second system of classification is most\neasily seen by focusing on the extra-linguistic interpretation. So, in\nwhat follows, I shall simplify matters by talking as if\nAristotle\u2019s first classificatory system is really a\nclassification of extra-linguistic items; and I shall note places at\nwhich such an interpretation faces difficulties.\n\nWhat then is Aristotle\u2019s second classificatory system? Quite\nsimply, it is a list of the highest kinds, which are also known as\ncategories. That there are highest kinds (or perhaps that\nthere is one single highest kind) can be motivated by noticing the\nfact that the ordinary objects of our experience fall into classes of\nincreasing generality. Consider, for instance, a maple tree. It is in\nthe first instance a maple and so belongs in a class with all and only\nother maples. It is also, however, a tree and so belongs in a broader\nclass, namely the class of trees, whose extension is wider than the\nclass of maples. Continuing on, it is also a living thing and so\nbelongs in a class whose extension is wider still than the class of\ntrees. And so on. Now, once this basic pattern is before us, we can\nask the following question: does this increase in generality go on ad\ninfinitum or does it end at a class that is the most general possible?\nDoes it end, in other words, at a highest kind?\n\nIt might seem that the answer to this question is obvious: of course\nthere is a highest kind \u2014 being. After all, someone might argue,\neverything exists. So the class that contains all and only beings must\nbe the class with the greatest possible extension. In the\nMetaphysics, however, Aristotle argues that being is not a\ngenus (998b23, 1059b31). According to Aristotle, every genus must be\ndifferentiated by some differentia that falls outside that genus.\nHence, if being were a genus, it would have to be differentiated by a\ndifferentia that fell outside of it. In other words, being would have\nto be differentiated by some non-being, which, according to Aristotle,\nis a metaphysical absurdity. Although he does not explicitly make this\nclaim, Aristotle\u2019s argument, if cogent, would generalize to any\nproposal for a single highest kind. Hence, he does not think that\nthere is one single highest kind. Instead, he thinks that there are\nten: (1) substance; (2) quantity; (3) quality; (4) relatives; (5)\nsomewhere; (6) sometime; (7) being in a position; (8) having; (9)\nacting; and (10) being acted upon (1b25\u20132a4). I shall discuss\nthe first four of these kinds in detail in a moment. But doing so will\ntake us into matters that, while interesting, nonetheless distract\nfrom the general nature of the scheme. So I will first discuss some of\nthe general structures inherent in Aristotle\u2019s second system of\nclassification, and then proceed to a more detailed discussion.\n\nIn addition to positing ten highest kinds, Aristotle also has views\nabout the structure of such kinds. Each kind is differentiated into\nspecies by some set of differentiae. In fact, the essence of any\nspecies, according to Aristotle, consists in its genus and the\ndifferentia that together with that genus defines the species. (It is\nfor this reason that the highest kinds are, strictly speaking,\nindefinable \u2014 because there is no genus above a highest kind,\none cannot define it in terms of its genus and a differentia.) Some of\nthe species in various categories are also genera \u2014 they are, in\nother words, differentiated into further species. But at some point,\nthere is a lowest species that is not further differentiated. Under\nthese species, we can suppose, fall the particulars that belong to\nthat species.\n\nNow, if we accept the characterization of said-of and present-in that\nI have given, we can see that Aristotle\u2019s two classificatory\nsystems can, so to speak, be laid on top of each other. The resulting\nstructure would look something like the following.\n\n\n\n\nSubstance\nQuantity\u00a0\u00a0Relatives\u00a0\u00a0Quality\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\n\n\nSaid-of\n\nNot Present-In\nSaid-of\n\nPresent-In \n\nNot Said-of\n\nNot Present-In\nNot Said-of\n\nPresent-In  \n\n\n\nSome features of this system are worth pointing out. First, as I have\nalready noted, Aristotle gives pride of place in this scheme to\nprimary substances. He says that were primary substances not to exist\nthen no other entity would exist (2b6). As a result, Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorialism is firmly anti-Platonic. Whereas Plato treated the\nabstract as more real than material particulars, in the\nCategories Aristotle takes material particulars as\nontological bedrock \u2014 to the extent that being a primary\nsubstance makes something more real than anything else, entities such\nas Socrates and a horse are the most real entities in\nAristotle\u2019s worldview. Moreover, among secondary substances,\nthose at a lower level of generality are what Aristotle calls\n\u2018prior in substance\u2019 than those at a higher level (2b7).\nSo, for instance, human is prior in substance than body. Whether this\nis to be interpreted in terms of the greater reality of the\nkind human is an open question. Nonetheless, Aristotle\u2019s\nequating an increase in generality with a decrease in substantiality\nis at least in spirit strongly anti-Platonic.\n\nThere is one other interesting general feature of this scheme that is\nworth pointing out before looking at its details. Aristotle\u2019s\nrejection of the view that being is a genus and his subsequent\nacceptance of ten distinct highest kinds leads to a doctrine\nconcerning being itself that is at the center of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics. (It should be noted, however, that there is\ngenuine disagreement over the extent to which Aristotle accepted the\ndoctrine of being that appears in the Metaphysics when he\nwrote the Categories.) According to Aristotle, some words do\nnot express a genus but instead are what he calls pros hen\nhomonyms \u2014 that is, homonyms related to one thing (pros\nhen), variously called cases of \u2018focal meaning\u2019 or\n\u2018focal connection\u2019 or \u2018core-dependent\nhomonymy\u2019 in the literature on this topic (1003a35 ff.). Such\nwords are applicable to various items in the world in virtue of the\nfact that those items all bear some type of relation to some one thing\nor type of thing. An example of such a homonym, according to\nAristotle, is \u2018healthy\u2019. A regimen, he says, is healthy\nbecause it is productive of health; urine is healthy because it is\nindicative of health; and Socrates is healthy because he has health.\nIn this case, a regimen, urine, and Socrates are all called\n\u2018healthy\u2019 not because they stand under some one genus,\nnamely healthy things, but instead because they all bear some relation\nto health. Similarly, according to Aristotle, things in the world are\nnot beings because they stand under some genus, being, but rather\nbecause they all stand in a relation to the primary being, which in\nthe Categories he says is substance. This explains in part\nwhy he says in the Metaphysics that in order to study being\none must study substance (1004a32, 1028a10\u20131028b8).\n",
