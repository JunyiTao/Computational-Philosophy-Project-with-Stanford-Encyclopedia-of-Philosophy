    "main_text": "\n\nWhatever else they do, all legal systems recognize, create, vary and\nenforce obligations. This is no accident: obligations are central to\nthe social role of law and explaining them is necessary to an\nunderstanding of law\u2019s authority and, therefore, its nature. Not\nonly are there obligations in the law, there are also\nobligations to the law. Historically, most philosophers\nagreed that these include a moral obligation to obey, or what\nis usually called \u201cpolitical obligation\u201d. For some, this\nis the consequence of some sort of transaction we enter with the\nstate. Since states provide us with crucially important benefits, we\nincur certain duties in return, either because we consent to incurring\nthese duties in exchange for the benefits, or because it would be\nunfair or ungrateful not to reciprocate for them. Other accounts are\nnon-transactional in nature, and ground political obligation in the\nfact that obeying the law enhances our ability to do what we have\nreason to do, in the fact that we have duties to maintain just legal\nsystems, or in special responsibilities qua members of our political\ncommunity. All these lines of argument have been subjected to thorough\ncriticism, and this has led some to deny that law is entitled to all\nthe authority it claims for itself, even when the legal system is\nlegitimate and reasonably just. On this view there are legal\nobligations that some of law\u2019s subjects have no moral obligation\nto perform.\n",
