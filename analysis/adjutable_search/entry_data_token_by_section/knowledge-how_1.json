    "main_text": "The Regress Argument || The Contemplation Argument\n1.1 The Contemplation Argument\n\nThe contemplation argument assumes for reductio that for any\naction to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical operation of\n\u201ccontemplating\u201d has to be performed first : \n\n\nContemplation premise (CP): In order to employ\none\u2019s knowledge that p, one must contemplate the\nproposition p. \n\n\nAssume in addition the following definition of intellectualism:\n\n\nStrong intellectualism (SI): For an action \u03a6,\nknowing how to \u03a6 consists in knowing some proposition\np.\n\n\nAnd assume further that in performing an action \u03a6, one employs\none\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6:\n\n\nAction premise (AP): For an action \u03a6, if one\n\u03a6s, then one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6.\n\n\nWith these premises the regress goes as follows. Suppose that one\nperforms an action \u03a6:\n\nBy AP, one employs one\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6. \nBy SI, one employs the knowledge that p, for some p.\n\nSo, by CP, one contemplates p. \nBut contemplating p is an action.\nSo by AP, if one contemplates p, one employs one\u2019s\nknowledge-how to contemplate p. \nBy CP, one ought to contemplate another proposition q, for\nsome q. \n\n\nAnd so on. \n\nThe contemplation argument aims at showing the falsity of SI, by\nshowing that its truth, together with the truth of AP and CP, triggers\nan infinite regress. If SI were true, then performing any action would\nrequire contemplating an infinite number of propositions of\never-increasing complexity. On the assumption that this cannot be done\nin a finite amount of time, the argument goes, accepting SI would lead\nto the clearly absurd conclusion that no agent could ever perform an\naction within a finite time (see Fantl 2011: 122). \n\nThe question is whether AP and CP are plausible premises. Following\nGinet (1975), Stanley & Williamson (2001) argue that AP is\nplausible only if the relevant \u03a6 is an intentional\naction. To use one of Ryle\u2019s (1949: 33) own examples, if a\nclumsy person inadvertently tumbles, it does not follow that in doing\nso, they employ their knowledge-how to tumble. By contrast, the clown\nemploys their knowledge-how when they tumble on purpose. Nevertheless,\nif we restrict AP to intentional actions, then the regress can be\nstopped by observing that contemplating a proposition might happen\nnon-intentionally. For example, when I employ my knowledge that there\nis a red light ahead by applying the brakes, I need not intentionally\ncontemplate the proposition that there is a red light ahead.\nCorrespondingly, if contemplating a proposition can be done\nnon-intentionally, such contemplation is not the kind of action that\nrequires us to know how to perform it\u2014therefore, it does not\ntrigger the restricted AP and the regress is blocked altogether. Some\nobject that the contemplation in this example might be intentional but\nunconscious (as suggested by No\u00eb 2005: 282). But it is\nunclear what reasons there are for thinking that every time one\nemploys one\u2019s knowledge, one intentionally contemplates the\nrelevant proposition (Cath 2013: 365\u2013366). \n\nThe Contemplation Argument also assumes CP\u2014i.e., that in order\nto employ propositional knowledge when acting, one ought to\ncontemplate the relevant proposition. Against CP, Ginet (1975: 7)\nobserves that one might manifest one\u2019s knowledge that one can\nget the door open by turning the knob and pushing it (as well as my\nknowledge that there is a door there) by performing that operation\nquite automatically as one leaves the room; and one may do this\nwithout formulating (in one\u2019s mind or out loud) that proposition\nor any other relevant proposition. Ginet concludes that Ryle\u2019s\noriginal argument does not teach us that intellectualism about\nknowledge-how is false but only that knowledge can be acted upon and\nmanifested without requiring any contemplation on the part of the\nagent. Indeed, some scholars think that this last weaker claim was the\nonly goal of Ryle\u2019s original argument (Rosefeldt 2004; Sax\n2010).\n",
