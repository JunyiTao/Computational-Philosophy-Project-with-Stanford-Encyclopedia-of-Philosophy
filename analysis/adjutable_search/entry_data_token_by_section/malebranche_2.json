    "main_text": "Cartesian Dualism\n3. Cartesian Dualism\n\nMalebranche tells Arnauld that it was Augustine\u2019s authority\n\u201cwhich has given me the desire to put forth the new\nphilosophy of ideas\u201d (Malebranche [OC], 6:80). By contrast,\nhe emphasizes in the preface of the Recherche that Augustine\nhad failed to see that sensible qualities \u201care not clearly\ncontained in the idea we have of matter,\u201d adding that \u201cthe\ndifference between mind and body has been known with sufficient\nclarity for only a few years\u201d (Malebranche [OC], 1:20). The\nallusion here is to Descartes\u2019s recent discovery of an idea of\nmatter that reveals that its nature consists in extension alone. This\nidea dictates that sensible qualities such as colors, tastes and odors\nthat are not reducible to modes of extension cannot exist external to\nmind. But since these qualities exist in the mind, and in particular\nin the mind\u2019s perception of the qualities, the mind itself must\nbe distinguished from body. In this way the Cartesian idea of matter\nreveals \u201cthe difference between mind and body.\u201d\n\nIn the initial book of the Recherche, on the senses,\nMalebranche proposes that the erroneous belief in the Aristotelians as\nwell as in Augustine that sensible qualities exist in bodies has its\nsource in a misuse of \u201cnatural judgments\u201d that help in the\nconservation of the human body. Here he is following Descartes\u2019\naccount in \u201cMeditation VI\u201d of the \u201cteachings of\nnature,\u201d and in particular the claim there that the purpose of\nsensations is not to teach us about the nature of bodies but simply to\ninform us of what is beneficial or harmful to the human composite.\nJust as Descartes had urged that erroneous beliefs about the nature of\nbody can be avoided by attending to the clear and distinct perceptions\nof the intellect, so Malebranche counseles that we avoid error by\nattending to what the clear idea of matter reveals to us about the\nnature of body. As we have seen, Malebranche has Augustinian reasons\nfor saying that the idea that so instructs us exists in God. By his\nown admission, however, the conclusion that the idea that instructs us\nis an idea of extension derives from the recent discoveries\nof Descartes.\n\nMalebranche emphasizes that the clear idea of extension must be\ndistinguished from our confused sensations. One point he wants to make\nis that the idea exists in God while the sensations are only\nmodifications of our mind. However, his emphasis on the fact that this\nidea is \u201cpure\u201d or non-sensory indicates that our\nexperience of the material world has an intellectual component. We\nhave seen that his late doctrine of the efficacious idea involved the\nposition that we have pure intellectual perceptions produced by\nGod\u2019s intellectual idea of extension. But his mature position\nthat this idea is also the cause of our sensations allows for the\nclaim that our most basic sensory contact with the material world has\nan intellectual component.\n\nWe know that Malebranche\u2019s doctrine of the vision in God\nconflicts with Descartes\u2019 doctrine of the creation of the\neternal truths. However, there are further departures from orthodox\nCartesianism that are linked to two qualifications of this doctrine.\nThe first qualification is that God\u2019s idea of extension can\nreveal only the nature of bodies and not their existence. This\nqualification is not explicit in the initial edition of the\nRecherche, which says only that the existence of properties\nof bodies external to us is \u201cvery difficult to prove\u201d\n(Malebranche [OC], 1:122). Foucher had objected that Malebranche has\nno good reason to affirm the external existence of these properties.\nIn \u201cEclaircissement VI,\u201d Malebranche urges that the idea\nof extension does reveal the possible existence of the material world,\nand that Descartes has shown that we have a probable argument for its\nactual existence deriving from our natural propensity to believe that\nthere are bodies. However, he concedes in this text\u2014without\ncrediting Foucher\u2014that neither he nor Descartes can provide an\nargument from reason that demonstrates \u201cwith evidence\u201d or\n\u201cwith geometric rigor\u201d that this belief is true. His\nconclusion is that such an argument must appeal to faith in the\nveracity of the report in the Scriptures that God has created the\nheavens and the earth.\n\nAccording to the second qualification of the vision in God\u2014which\nis found in the original edition of the Recherche\u2014we\nperceive the nature of our soul not through a clear idea in God, but\nonly through a confused \u201cconsciousness or inner sensation\u201d\n(conscience ou sentiment int\u00e9rieur). Malebranche\naccepts the Cartesian commonplace that consciousness reveals\nimmediately the existence of the soul. He allows that we know the\nnature of our soul to consist in thought, moreover, and he embraces\nthe Cartesian conclusion that the soul as a thinking thing is distinct\nfrom body as an extended thing. Yet he insists that we know that the\nsoul is distinct from the body not by means of any direct insight into\nthe nature of thought, but rather by seeing that thought is not\ncontained in the idea of matter. More generally, Malebranche claims\nthat our lack of access to a clear idea of the soul is evident from\nthe fact that we do not have knowledge of thought that matches our\nknowledge of the mathematical features of bodies. This last point\nturns on its head Descartes\u2019 own conclusion in \u201cMeditation\nII\u201d that the nature of the human mind is \u201cbetter\nknown\u201d than the nature of body; for Malebranche, it is the\nnature of body that is better known than the nature of mind.\n\nIn \u201cEclaircissement XI,\u201d Malebranche attempts to counter\n\u201cthe authority of Descartes\u201d by arguing that the\nCartesians themselves must admit that they have only a confused\nawareness of the nature of the sensory modifications of the soul. He\nnotes that while the intellectual idea allows the various modes of\nextension to be related in a precise manner, there is no clear scale\non which we can order our sensations of different shades of the same\ncolor, not to mention our sensations of sensible qualities of\ndifferent kinds. Malebranche takes the confusion in the sensations to\nreveal a confusion in our perception of the nature of the soul. He\nadds that Cartesians can discern that sensible qualities are\nmodifications of an immaterial soul only by seeing that they are\n\u201cnot clearly contained in the idea we have of matter.\u201d For\na discussion sympathetic to Malebranche\u2019s critique of\nDescartes\u2019s account of our knowledge of mind, see Schmaltz\n(1996); for more recent discussions that defend Descartes against this\ncritique, see Nolan and Whipple (2005) and LoLorodo (2005).\n",
