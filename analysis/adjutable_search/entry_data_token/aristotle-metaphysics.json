The Subject Matter of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nAristotle himself described his subject matter in a variety of ways:\nas \u2018first philosophy\u2019, or \u2018the study of being qua\nbeing\u2019, or \u2018wisdom\u2019, or \u2018theology\u2019. A\ncomment on these descriptions will help to clarify Aristotle\u2019s\ntopic.\n\nIn Metaphysics \u0391.1, Aristotle says that \u201ceveryone\ntakes what is called \u2018wisdom\u2019 (sophia) to be\nconcerned with the primary causes (aitia) and the\nstarting-points (or principles, archai)\u201d\n(981b28), and it is these causes and principles that he\nproposes to study in this work. It is his customary practice to begin\nan inquiry by reviewing the opinions previously held by others, and\nthat is what he does here, as Book \u0391 continues with a history of\nthe thought of his predecessors about causes and principles.\n\nThese causes and principles are clearly the subject matter of what he\ncalls \u2018first philosophy\u2019. But this does not mean the\nbranch of philosophy that should be studied first. Rather, it concerns\nissues that are in some sense the most fundamental or at the highest\nlevel of generality. Aristotle distinguished between things that are\n\u201cbetter known to us\u201d and things that are \u201cbetter\nknown in\n themselves,\u201d[1]\n and maintained that we should begin our study of a given topic with\nthings better known to us and arrive ultimately at an understanding of\nthings better known in themselves. The principles studied by\n\u2018first philosophy\u2019 may seem very general and abstract, but\nthey are, according to Aristotle, better known in themselves, however\nremote they may seem from the world of ordinary experience. Still,\nsince they are to be studied only by one who has already studied\nnature (which is the subject matter of the Physics), they are\nquite appropriately described as coming \u201cafter the\nPhysics.\u201d\n\nAristotle\u2019s description \u2018the study of being qua\nbeing\u2019 is frequently and easily misunderstood, for it seems to\nsuggest that there is a single (albeit special) subject\nmatter\u2014being qua being\u2014that is under investigation. But\nAristotle\u2019s description does not involve two things\u2014(1) a\nstudy and (2) a subject matter (being qua being)\u2014for he did not\nthink that there is any such subject matter as \u2018being qua\nbeing\u2019. Rather, his description involves three things: (1) a\nstudy, (2) a subject matter (being), and (3) a manner in which the\nsubject matter is studied (qua being).\n\nAristotle\u2019s Greek word that has been Latinized as\n\u2018qua\u2019 means roughly \u2018in so far as\u2019 or\n\u2018under the aspect\u2019. A study of x qua y,\nthen, is a study of x that concerns itself solely with the\ny aspect of x. So Aristotle\u2019s study does not\nconcern some recondite subject matter known as \u2018being qua\nbeing\u2019. Rather it is a study of being, or better, of\nbeings\u2014of things that can be said to be\u2014that studies them\nin a particular way: as beings, in so far as they are beings.\n\nOf course, first philosophy is not the only field of inquiry to study\nbeings. Natural science and mathematics also study beings, but in\ndifferent ways, under different aspects. The natural scientist studies\nthem as things that are subject to the laws of nature, as things that\nmove and undergo change. That is, the natural scientist studies things\nqua movable (i.e., in so far as they are subject to change). The\nmathematician studies things qua countable and measurable. The\nmetaphysician, on the other hand, studies them in a more general and\nabstract way\u2014qua beings. So first philosophy studies the causes\nand principles of beings qua beings. In \u0393.2, Aristotle adds that\nfor this reason it studies the causes and principles of substances\n(ousiai). We will explain this connection in Section 3\nbelow.\n\nIn Book \u0395, Aristotle adds another description to the study of\nthe causes and principles of beings qua beings. Whereas natural\nscience studies objects that are material and subject to change, and\nmathematics studies objects that although not subject to change are\nnevertheless not separate from (i.e., independent of) matter, there is\nstill room for a science that studies things (if indeed there are any)\nthat are eternal, not subject to change, and independent of matter.\nSuch a science, he says, is theology, and this is the\n\u201cfirst\u201d and \u201chighest\u201d science.\nAristotle\u2019s identification of theology, so conceived, with the\nstudy of being qua being has proved challenging to his interpreters.\nWe discuss this identification in\n Section 14\n below.\n\nFinally, we may note that in Book \u0392, Aristotle delineates his\nsubject matter in a different way, by listing the problems or\nperplexities (aporiai) he hopes to deal with. Characteristic\nof these perplexities, he says, is that they tie our thinking up in\nknots. They include the following, among others: Are sensible\nsubstances the only ones that exist, or are there others besides them?\nIs it kinds or individuals that are the elements and principles of\nthings? And if it is kinds, which ones: the most generic or the most\nspecific? Is there a cause apart from matter? Is there anything apart\nfrom material compounds? Are the principles limited, either in number\nor in kind? Are the principles of perishable things themselves\nperishable? Are the principles universal or particular, and do they\nexist potentially or actually? Are mathematical objects (numbers,\nlines, figures, points) substances? If they are, are they separate\nfrom or do they always belong to sensible things? And (\u201cthe\nhardest and most perplexing of all,\u201d Aristotle says) are unity\nand being the substance of things, or are they attributes of some\nother subject? In the remainder of Book \u0392, Aristotle presents\narguments on both sides of each of these issues, and in subsequent\nbooks he takes up many of them again. But it is not always clear\nprecisely how he resolves them, and it is possible that Aristotle did\nnot think that the Metaphysics contains definitive solutions\nto all of these perplexities.\n2. The Categories\n\nTo understand the problems and project of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, it is best to begin with one of his earlier\nworks, the Categories. Although placed by long tradition\namong his logical works (see the discussion in the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s logic),\n due to its analysis of the terms that make up the propositions out of\nwhich deductive inferences are constructed, the Categories\nbegins with a strikingly general and exhaustive account of the things\nthere are (ta onta)\u2014beings. According to this account,\nbeings can be divided into ten distinct categories. (Although\nAristotle never says so, it is tempting to suppose that these\ncategories are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of the things\nthere are.) They include substance, quality, quantity, and relation,\namong others. Of these categories of beings, it is the first,\nsubstance (ousia), to which Aristotle gives a privileged\nposition.\n\nSubstances are unique in being independent things; the items in the\nother categories all depend somehow on substances. That is, qualities\nare the qualities of substances; quantities are the amounts and sizes\nthat substances come in; relations are the way substances stand to one\nanother. These various non-substances all owe their existence to\nsubstances\u2014each of them, as Aristotle puts it, exists only\n\u2018in\u2019 a subject. That is, each non-substance \u201cis in\nsomething, not as a part, and cannot exist separately from what it is\nin\u201d (Cat. 1a25). Indeed, it becomes clear\nthat substances are the subjects that these ontologically dependent\nnon-substances are \u2018in\u2019.\n\nEach member of a non-substance category thus stands in this inherence\nrelation (as it is frequently called) to some substance or\nother\u2014color is always found in bodies, knowledge in the soul.\nNeither whiteness nor a piece of grammatical knowledge, for example,\nis capable of existing on its own. Each requires for its existence\nthat there be some substance in which it inheres.\n\nIn addition to this fundamental inherence relation across categories,\nAristotle also points out another fundamental relation that obtains\nbetween items within a single category. He describes this as the\nrelation of \u201cbeing said of a subject,\u201d and his examples\nmake clear that it is the relation of a more general to a less general\nthing within a single category. Thus, man is \u2018said of\u2019 a\nparticular man, and animal is \u2018said of\u2019 man, and\ntherefore, as Aristotle points out, animal is \u2018said of\u2019\nthe particular man also. The \u2018said of\u2019 relation, that is\nto say, is transitive (cf. 1b10). So the genus (e.g.,\nanimal) is \u2018said of\u2019 the species (e.g., man) and both\ngenus and species are \u2018said of\u2019 the particular. The same\nholds in non-substance categories. In the category of quality, for\nexample, the genus (color) is \u2018said of\u2019 the species\n(white) and both genus and species are \u2018said of\u2019 the\nparticular white. There has been considerable scholarly dispute about\nthese particulars in nonsubstance categories. For more detail, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nNonsubstantial Particulars\n\n\nThe language of this contrast (\u2018in\u2019 a subject vs.\n\u2018said of\u2019 a subject) is peculiar to the\nCategories, but the idea seems to recur in other works as the\ndistinction between accidental vs. essential predication. Similarly,\nin works other than the Categories, Aristotle uses the label\n\u2018universals\u2019 (ta katholou) for the things that\nare \u201csaid of many;\u201d things that are not universal he calls\n\u2018particulars\u2019 (ta kath\u2019 hekasta). Although\nhe does not use these labels in the Categories, it is not\nmisleading to say that the doctrine of the Categories is that\neach category contains a hierarchy of universals and particulars, with\neach universal being \u2018said of\u2019 the lower-level universals\nand particulars that fall beneath it. Each category thus has the\nstructure of an upside-down\n tree.[2]\n At the top (or trunk) of the tree are the most generic items in that\n category[3]\n (e.g., in the case of the category of substance, the genus plant and\nthe genus animal); branching below them are universals at the next\nhighest level, and branching below these are found lower levels of\nuniversals, and so on, down to the lowest level universals (e.g., such\ninfimae species as man and horse); at the lowest\nlevel\u2014the leaves of the tree\u2014are found the individual\nsubstances, e.g., this man, that horse, etc.\n\nThe individuals in the category of substance play a special role in\nthis scheme. Aristotle calls them \u201cprimary substances\u201d\n(pr\u00f4tai ousiai) for without them, as he says, nothing\nelse would exist. Indeed, Aristotle offers an argument\n(2a35\u20132b7) to establish the primary\nsubstances as the fundamental entities in this ontology. Everything\nthat is not a primary substance, he points out, stands in one of the\ntwo relations (inhering \u2018in\u2019, or being \u2018said\nof\u2019) to primary substances. A genus, such as animal, is\n\u2018said of\u2019 the species below it and, since they are\n\u2018said of\u2019 primary substances, so is the genus (recall the\ntransitivity of the \u2018said of\u2019 relation). Thus, everything\nin the category of substance that is not itself a primary substance\nis, ultimately, \u2018said of\u2019 primary substances. And if there\nwere no primary substances, there would be no \u201csecondary\u201d\nsubstances (species and genera), either. For these secondary\nsubstances are just the ways in which the primary substances are\nfundamentally classified within the category of substance. As for the\nmembers of non-substance categories, they too depend for their\nexistence on primary substances. A universal in a non-substance\ncategory, e.g., color, in the category of quality, is \u2018in\u2019\nbody, Aristotle tells us, and therefore in individual bodies. For\ncolor could not be \u2018in\u2019 body, in general, unless it were\n\u2018in\u2019 at least some particular bodies. Similarly,\nparticulars in non-substance categories (although there is not general\nagreement among scholars about what such particulars might be) cannot\nexist on their own. E.g., a determinate shade of color, or a\nparticular and non-shareable bit of that shade, is not capable of\nexisting on its own\u2014if it were not \u2018in\u2019 at least\nsome primary substance, it would not exist. So primary substances are\nthe basic entities\u2014the basic \u201cthings that there\nare\u201d\u2014in the world of the Categories.\n3. The Role of Substance in the Study of Being Qua Being\n\nThe Categories leads us to expect that the study of being in\ngeneral (being qua being) will crucially involve the study of\nsubstance, and when we turn to the Metaphysics we are not\ndisappointed. First, in Metaphysics \u0393 Aristotle argues\nin a new way for the ontological priority of substance; and then, in\nBooks \u0396, \u0397, and \u0398, he wrestles with the problem of what\nit is to be a substance. We will begin with \u0393\u2019s account of\nthe central place of substance in the study of being qua being.\n\nAs we noted above, metaphysics (or, first philosophy) is the science\nwhich studies being qua being. In this respect it is unlike the\nspecialized or departmental sciences, which study only part of being\n(only some of the things that exist) or study beings only in a\nspecialized way (e.g., only in so far as they are changeable, rather\nthan in so far as they are beings).\n\nBut \u2018being\u2019, as Aristotle tells us in \u0393.2, is\n\u201csaid in many ways\u201d. That is, the verb \u2018to be\u2019\n(einai) has different senses, as do its cognates\n\u2018being\u2019 (on) and \u2018entities\u2019\n(onta). So the universal science of being qua being appears\nto founder on an equivocation: how can there be a single science of\nbeing when the very term \u2018being\u2019 is ambiguous?\n\nConsider an analogy. There are dining tables, and there are tide\ntables. A dining table is a table in the sense of a smooth flat slab\nfixed on legs; a tide table is a table in the sense of a systematic\narrangement of data in rows and columns. But there is not a single\nsense of \u2018table\u2019 which applies to both the piece of\nfurniture at which I am writing these words and to the small booklet\nthat lies upon it. Hence it would be foolish to expect that there is a\nsingle science of tables, in general, that would include among its\nobjects both dining tables and tide tables. Tables, that is to say, do\nnot constitute a single kind with a single definition, so no single\nscience, or field of knowledge, can encompass precisely those things\nthat are correctly called \u2018tables\u2019.\n\nIf the term \u2018being\u2019 were ambiguous in the way that\n\u2018table\u2019 is, Aristotle\u2019s science of being qua being\nwould be as impossible as a science of tables qua tables. But,\nAristotle argues in \u0393.2, \u2018being\u2019 is not ambiguous in\nthis way. \u2018Being\u2019, he tells us, is \u2018said in many\nways\u2019 but it is not merely (what he calls)\n\u2018homonymous\u2019, i.e., sheerly ambiguous. Rather, the various\nsenses of \u2018being\u2019 have what he calls a \u2018pros\nhen\u2019 ambiguity\u2014they are all related to a single\ncentral sense. (The Greek phrase \u2018pros hen\u2019 means\n\u201cin relation to one.\u201d)\n\nAristotle explains his point by means of some examples that he takes\nto be analogous to \u2018being\u2019. Consider the terms\n\u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018medical\u2019. Neither of these has\na single definition that applies uniformly to all cases: not every\nhealthy (or medical) thing is healthy (medical) in the same sense of\n\u2018healthy\u2019 (\u2018medical\u2019). There is a range of\nthings that can be called \u2018healthy\u2019: people, diets,\nexercise, complexions, etc. Not all of these are healthy in the same\nsense. Exercise is healthy in the sense of being productive of health;\na clear complexion is healthy in the sense of being symptomatic of\nhealth; a person is healthy in the sense of having good health.\n\nBut notice that these various senses have something in common: a\nreference to one central thing, health, which is actually possessed by\nonly some of the things that are spoken of as \u2018healthy\u2019,\nnamely, healthy organisms, and these are said to be healthy in the\nprimary sense of the term. Other things are considered healthy only in\nso far as they are appropriately related to things that are healthy in\nthis primary sense.\n\nThe situation is the same, Aristotle claims, with the term\n\u2018being\u2019. It, too, has a primary sense as well as related\nsenses in which it applies to other things because they are\nappropriately related to things that are called \u2018beings\u2019\nin the primary sense. The beings in the primary sense are substances;\nthe beings in other senses are the qualities, quantities, etc., that\nbelong to substances. An animal, e.g., a horse, is a being, and so is\na color, e.g, white, a being. But a horse is a being in the primary\nsense\u2014it is a substance\u2014whereas the color white (a\nquality) is a being only because it qualifies some substance. An\naccount of the being of anything that is, therefore, will ultimately\nhave to make some reference to substance. Hence, the science of being\nqua being will involve an account of the central case of\nbeings\u2014substances.\n4. The Fundamental Principles: Axioms\n\nBefore embarking on this study of substance, however, Aristotle goes\non in Book \u0393 to argue that first philosophy, the most general of\nthe sciences, must also address the most fundamental\nprinciples\u2014the common axioms\u2014that are used in all\nreasoning. Thus, first philosophy must also concern itself with the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (PNC): the principle that \u201cthe\nsame thing cannot at the same time belong and also not belong to the\nsame thing and in the same respect\u201d (1005b19). This,\nAristotle says, is the most certain of all principles, and it is not\njust a hypothesis. It cannot, however, be proved, since it is\nemployed, implicitly, in all proofs, no matter what the subject\nmatter. It is a first principle, and hence is not derived from\nanything more basic.\n\nWhat, then, can the science of first philosophy say about the PNC? It\ncannot offer a proof of the PNC, since the PNC is presupposed by any\nproof one might offer\u2014any purported proof of the PNC would\ntherefore be circular. Aristotle thus does not attempt to prove the\nPNC; in the subsequent chapters of \u0393 he argues, instead, that it\nis impossible to disbelieve the PNC. Those who would claim to deny the\nPNC cannot, if they have any beliefs at all, believe that it is false.\nFor one who has a belief must, if he is to express this belief to\nhimself or to others, say something\u2014he must make an assertion.\nHe must, as Aristotle says, signify something. But the very act of\nsignifying something is possible only if the PNC is accepted. Without\naccepting the PNC, one would have no reason to think that his words\nhave any signification at all\u2014they could not mean one thing\nrather than another. So anyone who makes any assertion has already\ncommitted himself to the PNC. Aristotle thus does not argue that the\nPNC is a necessary truth (that is, he does not try to prove the PNC);\nrather, he argues that the PNC is indubitable. (For more on the PNC,\nsee the discussion in the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s logic)\n5. What is Substance?\n\nIn the seventeen chapters that make up Book \u0396 of the\nMetaphysics, Aristotle takes up the promised study of\nsubstance. He begins by reiterating and refining some of what he said\nin \u0393: that \u2018being\u2019 is said in many ways, and that\nthe primary sense of \u2018being\u2019 is the sense in which\nsubstances are beings. Here, however, he explicitly links the\nsecondary senses of \u2018being\u2019 to the non-substance\ncategories. The primacy of substance leads Aristotle to say that the\nage-old question \u2018What is being?\u2019 \u201cis just the\nquestion \u2018What is substance?\u2019\u201d\n(1028b4).\n\nOne might have thought that this question had already been answered in\nthe Categories. There we were given, as examples of primary\nsubstances, an individual man or horse, and we learned that a primary\nsubstance is \u201cwhat is neither in a subject nor said of a\nsubject\u201d (2a10). This would seem to provide us with\nboth examples of, and criteria for being, primary substances. But in\nMetaphysics \u0396, Aristotle does not seem to take either\nthe examples or the criteria for granted.\n\nIn \u0396.2 he recounts the various answers that have been given to\nthe question of which things are substances\u2014bodies (including\nplants, animals, the parts of plants and animals, the elements, the\nheavenly bodies), things more basic than bodies (surfaces, lines, and\npoints), imperceptible things (such as Platonic Forms and mathematical\nobjects)\u2014and seems to regard them all as viable candidates at\nthis point. He does not seem to doubt that the clearest examples of\nsubstances are perceptible ones, but leaves open the question whether\nthere are others as well.\n\nBefore answering this question about examples, however, he says that\nwe must first answer the question about criteria: what is it to be a\nsubstance (t\u00ean ousian pr\u00f4ton ti estin)? The\nnegative criterion (\u201cneither in a subject nor said of a\nsubject\u201d) of the Categories tells us only which things\nare substances. But even if we know that something is a\nsubstance, we must still say what makes it a\nsubstance\u2014what the cause is of its being a substance. This is\nthe question to which Aristotle next turns. To answer it is to\nidentify, as Aristotle puts it, the substance of that\nthing.\n6. Substance, Matter, and Subject\n\n\u0396.3 begins with a list of four possible candidates for being the\nsubstance of something: essence, universal, genus, and subject.\nPresumably, this means that if x is a substance, then the\nsubstance of x might be either (i) the essence of x,\nor (ii) some universal predicated of x, or (iii) a genus that\nx belongs to, or (iv) a subject of which x is\npredicated. The first three candidates are taken up in later chapters,\nand \u0396.3 is devoted to an examination of the fourth candidate: the\nidea that the substance of something is a subject of which it is\npredicated.\n\nA subject, Aristotle tells us, is \u201cthat of which the other\nthings are said, but which is itself not further said of any other\nthing\u201d (1028b36). This characterization of a subject\nis reminiscent of the language of the Categories, which tells\nus that a primary substance is not predicated of anything else,\nwhereas other things are predicated of it. Candidate (iv) thus seems\nto reiterate the Categories criterion for being a substance.\nBut there are two reasons to be wary of drawing this conclusion.\nFirst, whereas the subject criterion of the Categories told\nus that substances were the ultimate subjects of predication, the\nsubject criterion envisaged here is supposed to tell us what the\nsubstance of something is. So what it would tell us is that\nif x is a substance, then the substance of\nx\u2014that which makes x a substance\u2014is a\nsubject that x is predicated of. Second, as his next comment\nmakes clear, Aristotle has in mind something other than this\nCategories idea. For the subject that he here envisages, he\nsays, is either matter or form or the compound of matter and form.\nThese are concepts from Aristotle\u2019s Physics, and none\nof them figured in the ontology of the Categories. To\nappreciate the issues Aristotle is raising here, we must briefly\ncompare his treatment of the notion of a subject in the\nPhysics with that in the Categories.\n\nIn the Categories, Aristotle was concerned with subjects of\npredication: what are the things we talk about, and ascribe properties\nto? In the Physics, his concern is with subjects of change:\nwhat is it that bears (at different times) contrary predicates and\npersists through a process of change? But there is an obvious\nconnection between these conceptions of a subject, since a subject of\nchange must have one predicate belonging to it at one time that does\nnot belong to it at another time. Subjects of change, that is, are\nalso subjects of predication. (The converse is not true: numbers are\nsubjects of predication\u2014six is even, seven is prime\u2014but\nnot of change.)\n\nIn the Categories, individual substances (a man, a horse)\nwere treated as fundamental subjects of predication. They were also\nunderstood, indirectly, as subjects of change. (\u201cA substance,\none and the same in number, can receive contraries. An individual man,\nfor example, being one and the same, becomes now pale and now dark,\nnow hot and now cold, now bad and now good\u201d\n4a17\u201320.) These are changes in which substances move,\nor alter, or grow. What the Categories did not explore,\nhowever, are changes in which substances are generated or destroyed.\nBut the theory of change Aristotle develops in the Physics\nrequires some other subject for changes such as these\u2014a subject\nof which substance is predicated\u2014and it identifies matter as the\nfundamental subject of change (192a31\u201332). Change is\nseen in the Physics as a process in which matter either takes\non or loses form.\n\nThe concepts of matter and form, as we noted, are absent from the\nCategories. Individual substances\u2014this man or that\nhorse\u2014apart from their accidental characteristics\u2014the\nqualities, etc., that inhere in them\u2014are viewed in that work as\nessentially simple, unanalyzable atoms. Although there is metaphysical\nstructure to the fact that, e.g., this horse is white (a\ncertain quality inheres in a certain substance), the fact that\nthis is a horse is a kind of brute fact, devoid of\nmetaphysical structure. This horse is a primary substance, and\nhorse, the species to which it belongs, is a secondary\nsubstance. But there is no predicative complex corresponding to the\nfact that this is a horse in the way that there is such a complex\ncorresponding to the fact that this horse is white.\n\nBut from the point of view of the Physics, substantial\nindividuals are seen as predicative complexes (cf. Matthen 1987b);\nthey are hylomorphic compounds\u2014compounds of matter and\nform\u2014and the subject criterion looks rather different from the\nhylomorphic perspective. Metaphysics \u0396.3 examines the\nsubject criterion from this perspective.\n\nMatter, form, and the compound of matter and form may all be\nconsidered subjects, Aristotle tells us, (1029a2\u20134),\nbut which of them is substance? The subject criterion by itself leads\nto the answer that the substance of x is an entirely\nindeterminate matter of which x is composed\n(1029a10). For form is predicated of matter as subject, and\none can always analyze a hylomorphic compound into its predicates and\nthe subject of which they are predicated. And when all predicates have\nbeen removed (in thought), the subject that remains is nothing at all\nin its own right\u2014an entity all of whose properties are\naccidental to it (1029a12\u201327). The resulting subject\nis matter from which all form has been expunged. (Traditional\nscholarship calls this \u201cprime matter,\u201d but Aristotle does\nnot here indicate whether he thinks there actually is such a thing.)\nSo the subject criterion leads to the answer that the substance of\nx is the formless matter of which it is ultimately\ncomposed.\n\nBut Aristotle rejects this answer as impossible (1029a28),\nclaiming that substance must be \u201cseparable\u201d\n(ch\u00f4riston) and \u201cthis something\u201d (tode\nti, sometimes translated \u201csome this\u201d), and implying\nthat matter fails to meet this requirement. Precisely what the\nrequirement amounts to is a matter of considerable scholarly debate,\nhowever. A plausible interpretation runs as follows. Separability has\nto do with being able to exist independently (x is separable\nfrom y if x is capable of existing independently of\ny), and being a this something means being a determinate\nindividual. So a substance must be a determinate individual that is\ncapable of existing on its own. (One might even hold, although this is\ncontroversial, that on Aristotle\u2019s account not every \u201cthis\nsomething\u201d is also \u201cseparable.\u201d A particular color\nor shape might be considered a determinate individual that is not\ncapable of existing on its own\u2014it is always the color of shape\nof some substance or other.) But matter fails to be simultaneously\nboth ch\u00f4riston and tode ti. The matter of\nwhich a substance is composed may exist independently of that\nsubstance (think of the wood of which a desk is composed, which\nexisted before the desk was made and may survive the disassembly of\nthe desk), but it is not as such any definite individual\u2014it is\njust a quantity of a certain kind of matter. Of course, the matter may\nbe construed as constituting a definite individual substance (the wood\njust is, one might say, the particular desk it composes), but\nit is in that sense not separable from the form or shape that makes it\nthat substance (the wood cannot be that particular desk unless it is\na desk). So although matter is in a sense separable and in a\nsense a this something, it cannot be both separable and a this\nsomething. It thus does not qualify as the substance of the thing\nwhose matter it is.\n7. Substance and Essence\n\nAristotle turns in \u0396.4 to a consideration of the next candidate\nfor substance: essence. (\u2018Essence\u2019 is the standard English\ntranslation of Aristotle\u2019s curious phrase to ti \u00ean\neinai, literally \u201cthe what it was to be\u201d for a thing.\nThis phrase so boggled his Roman translators that they coined the word\nessentia to render the entire phrase, and it is from this\nLatin word that ours derives. Aristotle also sometimes uses the\nshorter phrase to ti esti, literally \u201cthe what it\nis,\u201d for approximately the same idea.) In his\n logical works,\n Aristotle links the notion of essence to that of definition\n(horismos)\u2014\u201ca definition is an account\n(logos) that signifies an essence\u201d (Topics\n102a3)\u2014and he links both of these notions to a\ncertain kind of per se predication (kath\u2019\nhauto, literally, \u201cin respect of itself,\u201d or\n\u201cintrinsically\u201c)\u2014\u201dwhat belongs to a thing in\nrespect of itself belongs to it in its essence (en t\u00f4i ti\nesti)\u201d for we refer to it \u201cin the account that states\nthe essence\u201d (Posterior Analytics,\n73a34\u20135). He reiterates these ideas in \u0396.4:\n\u201cthere will be an essence only of those things whose\nlogos is a definition\u201d (1030a6), \u201cthe\nessence of each thing is what it is said to be intrinsically\u201d\n(1029b14). It is important to remember that for Aristotle,\none defines things, not words. The definition of tiger does not tell\nus the meaning of the word \u2018tiger\u2019; it tells us what it is\nto be a tiger, what a tiger is said to be intrinsically. Thus, the\ndefinition of tiger states the essence\u2014the \u201cwhat it is to\nbe\u201d of a tiger, what is predicated of the tiger per\nse.\n\nAristotle\u2019s preliminary answer (\u0396.4) to the question\n\u201cWhat is substance?\u201d is that substance is essence, but\nthere are important qualifications. For, as he points out,\n\u201cdefinition (horismos), like \u2018what-it-is\u2019\n(ti esti), is said in many ways too\u201d\n(1030a19). That is, items in all the categories are\ndefinable, so items in all the categories have essences\u2014just as\nthere is an essence of man, there is also an essence of white and an\nessence of musical. But, because of the pros hen equivocity\nof \u2018is\u2019, such essences are secondary\u2014\u201cin the\nprimary (prot\u00f4s) and unconditional way\n(hapl\u00f4s) definition and the essence belong to\nsubstances\u201d (1030b4\u20136). Thus, \u0396.4 tells\nus, it is only these primary essences that are substances. Aristotle\ndoes not here work out the details of this \u201chierarchy of\nessences\u201d (Loux, 1991), but it is possible to reconstruct a\ntheory of such a hierarchy on the basis of subsequent developments in\nBook \u0396.\n\nIn \u0396.6, Aristotle goes on to argue that if something is\n\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201cspoken of in respect of itself\n(kath\u2019 hauto legomenon)\u201d it is one and the same\nas its essence. The precise meaning of this claim, as well as the\nnature and validity of the arguments offered in support of it, are\nmatters of scholarly controversy. But it does seem safe to say that\nAristotle thinks that an \u201caccidental unity\u201d such as a pale\nman is not a kath\u2019 hauto legomenon (since pallor is an\naccidental characteristic of a man) and so is not the same as its\nessence. Pale man, that is to say, does not specify the\n\u201cwhat it is\u201d of any primary being, and so cannot be an\nessence of the primary kind. As \u0396.4 has already told us, essence,\nin the primary sense, \u201cwill belong to things that are species of\na genus and to nothing else\u201d (1030a11\u201312).\nMan is a species, and so there is an essence of man; but\npale man is not a species and so, even if there is such a\nthing as the essence of pale man, it is not, at any rate, a primary\nessence.\n\nAt this point there appears to be a close connection between the\nessence of a substance and its species (eidos), and this\nmight tempt one to suppose that Aristotle is identifying the substance\nof a thing (since the substance of a thing is its essence) with its\nspecies. (A consequence of this idea would be that Aristotle is\nradically altering his conception of the importance of the species,\nwhich in the Categories he called a secondary substance, that\nis, a substance only in a secondary sense.) But such an identification\nwould be a mistake, for two reasons. First, Aristotle\u2019s point at\n1030a11 is not that a species is an essence, but that an\nessence of the primary kind corresponds to a species (e.g.,\nman) and not to some more narrowly delineated kind (e.g.,\npale man). Second, the word \u2018eidos\u2019,\nwhich meant \u2018species\u2019 in the logical works, has acquired a\nnew meaning in a hylomorphic context, where it means\n\u2018form\u2019 (contrasted with \u2018matter\u2019) rather than\n\u2018species\u2019 (contrasted with \u2018genus\u2019). In the\nconceptual framework of Metaphysics \u0396, a universal such\nas man or horse\u2014which was called a species and\na secondary substance in the Categories\u2014is construed as\n\u201cnot substance but rather a compound of a sort, [consisting] of\nthis account and this matter taken universally\u201d (\u0396.10,\n1035b29\u201330). The eidos that is primary\nsubstance in Book \u0396 is not the species that an individual\nsubstance belongs to but the form that is predicated of the matter of\nwhich it is\n composed.[4]\n8. Substances as Hylomorphic Compounds\n\nThe role of form in this hylomorphic context is the topic of\n\u0396.7\u20139. (Although these chapters were almost certainly not\noriginally included in Book \u0396\u2014there is no reference to\nthem, for example, in the summary of \u0396 given in \u0397.1, which\nskips directly from \u0396.6 to \u0396.10\u2014they provide a link\nbetween substance and form and thus fill what would otherwise be a gap\nin the argument.) Since individual substances are seen as hylomorphic\ncompounds, the role of matter and form in their generation must be\naccounted for. Whether we are thinking of natural objects, such as\nplants and animals, or artifacts, such as houses, the requirements for\ngeneration are the same. We do not produce the matter (to suppose that\nwe do leads to an infinite regress) nor do we produce the form (what\ncould we make it out of?); rather, we put the form into the matter,\nand produce the compound (\u0396.8, 1033a30\u2013b9). Both\nthe matter and the form must pre-exist (\u0396.9, 1034b12).\nBut the source of motion in both cases\u2014what Aristotle calls the\n\u201cmoving cause\u201d of the coming to be\u2014is the form.\n\nIn production that results from craft (or art, techn\u00ea),\n\u201cthe form is in the soul \u201d (1032b23) of the\ncraftsman. For example, \u201cthe craft [of building] is the form [of\nthe house]\u201d (1034a24) and the craft, i.e., the form,\nis in the understanding, and hence in the soul, of the builder. The\nbuilder has in mind the plan or design for a house and he knows how to\nbuild; he then \u201cenmatters\u201d that plan or design by putting\nit into the materials out of which he builds the house. In natural\nproduction, the form is found in the parent, where \u201cthe begetter\nis of this same sort as the begotten (not that they are the same\nthing, certainly, nor one in number, but one in form)\u2014for\nexample, in the case of natural things. For human begets human\u201d\n(1033b29\u201331). But in either case, the form pre-exists\nand is not produced (1033b18).\n\nAs for what is produced in such hylomorphic productions, it is\ncorrectly described by the name of its form, not by that of its\nmatter. What is produced is a house or a man, not bricks or flesh. Of\ncourse, what is made of gold may still be described in terms of its\nmaterial components, but we should call it not \u201cgold\u201d but\n\u201cgolden\u201d (1033a7). For if gold is the matter\nout of which a statue is made, there was gold present at the start,\nand so it was not gold that came into being. It was a statue that came\ninto being, and although the statue is golden\u2014i.e., made of\ngold\u2014it cannot be identified with the gold of which it was\nmade.\n\nThe essence of such a hylomorphic compound is evidently its form, not\nits matter. As Aristotle says \u201cby form I mean the essence of\neach thing and the primary substance\u201d (1032b1), and\n\u201cby the substance without matter I mean the essence\u201d\n(1032b14). It is the form of a substance that makes it the\nkind of thing that it is, and hence it is form that satisfies the\ncondition initially required for being the substance of\nsomething. The substance of a thing is its form.\n\n9. Substance and Definition\n\nIn \u0396.10 and 11, Aristotle returns to the consideration of essence\nand definition left off in \u0396.6, but now within the hylomorphic\ncontext developed in \u0396.7\u20139. The main question these\nchapters consider is whether the definition of x ever\nincludes a reference to the matter of x. If some definitions\ninclude a reference to matter, then the link between essence and form\nwould seem to be weakened.\n\nAristotle begins \u0396.10 by endorsing the following principle about\ndefinitions and their parts: \u201ca definition is an account, and\nevery account has parts, and as the account is to the thing, so the\npart of the account is to the part of the thing\u201d\n(1034b20\u201322). That is, if y is a part of a\ndefinable thing x, then the definition of x will\ninclude as a part something z that corresponds to y.\nIndeed, z must stand to y in the same relation that\nthe definition of x stands in to x; that is,\nz is the definition of y. So, according to this\nprinciple, the definition of a thing will include the definitions of\nits parts.\n\nIn a way, this consequence of the principle seems very plausible,\ngiven Aristotle\u2019s idea that it is universals that are definable\n(\u0396.11, 1036a29). Consider as a definiendum a\nuniversal, such as man, and its definiens, rational\nanimal. The parts of this definiens are the universals\nrational and animal. If these parts are, in turn,\ndefinable, then each should be replaced, in the definition of\nman, with its own definition, and so on. In this way the\ncomplete and adequate definition of a universal such as man\nwill contain no parts that are further definable. All proper, or\ncompletely analyzed, definitions are ultimately composed of simple\nterms that are not further definable.\n\nBut the implication of this idea for the definitions of hylomorphic\ncompounds is obvious: since matter appears to be a part of such a\ncompound, the definition of the compound will include, as a part, the\ndefinitions of its material components. And this consequence seems\nimplausible to Aristotle. A circle, for example, seems to be composed\nof two semicircles (for it obviously may be divided into two\nsemicircles), but the definition of circle cannot be composed\nof the definitions of its two semicircular parts. For, as Aristotle\npoints out (1035b9), semicircle is defined in\nterms of circle, and not the other way around. His point is\nwell taken, for if circles were defined in terms of semicircles, then\npresumably semicircles would be defined in terms of the\nquarter-circles of which they are composed, and so on, ad\ninfinitum. The resulting infinite regress would make it\nimpossible to define circle at all, for one would never reach\nthe ultimate \u201csimple\u201d parts of which such a definition\nwould be composed.\n\nAristotle flirts with the idea of distinguishing between different\nsenses in which one thing can be a part of another\n(1034b33), but instead proposes a different solution: to\nspecify carefully the whole of which the matter is allegedly a part.\n\u201cAnd of the compound statue the bronze is a part, but of what is\nsaid to be a statue as form it is not a part\u201d\n(1035a6). Similarly, \u201ceven if the line, when divided,\npasses away into the halves, or the human into the bones, sinews, and\nflesh, it is not the case that because of this they are composed of\nthese as being parts of the substance\u201d\n(1035a17\u201320). Rather, \u201cwhat is divided into\nthese as into matter is not the substance but the compound\u201d\n(1035b20\u20131).\n\nIn restating his point \u201cyet more perspicuously\u201d\n(1035b4), Aristotle notes parenthetically another important\naspect of his theory of substance. He reiterates the priority of form,\nand its parts, to the matter into which a compound is divided, and\nnotes that \u201cthe soul of animals (for this is substance of the\nanimate) is the substance that is in accord with the account and is\nthe form and the essence\u201d (1035b14\u20135). The idea\nrecurs in \u0396.11, where he announces that \u201cit is clear too\nthat the soul is primary substance, whereas the body is matter\u201d\n(1037a5). It is further developed, in the\nMetaphysics, in \u0396.17, as we will see below, and\nespecially in De Anima. For more detail on this topic, see\nSection 3 of the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s psychology.\n\nReturning now to the problem raised by the apparent need to refer to\nmatter in the definition of a substance, we may note that the solution\nAristotle offered in \u0396.10 is only partially successful. His point\nseems to be that whereas bronze may be a part of a particular statue,\nneither that particular batch of bronze nor even bronze in general\nenters into the essence of statue, since being made of bronze is no\npart of what it is to be a statue. But that is only because statues,\nalthough they must be made of some kind of matter, do not require any\nparticular kind of matter. But what about kinds of substances that do\nrequire particular kinds of matter? Aristotle\u2019s distinction\nbetween form and compound cannot be used in such cases to isolate\nessence from matter. Thus there may after all be reasons for thinking\nthat reference to matter will have to intrude into at least some\ndefinitions.\n\nIn \u0396.11, Aristotle addresses just such a case (although the\npassage is difficult and there is disagreement over its\ninterpretation). \u201cThe form of the human is always found in flesh\nand bones and parts of this sort,\u201d Aristotle writes\n(1036b4). The point is not just that each particular man\nmust be made of matter, but that each one must be made of matter of a\nparticular kind\u2014flesh and bones, etc. \u201cSome things,\u201d\nhe continues, \u201cpresumably are this in this\u201d\n(1036b23), i.e., a particular form in a particular kind of\nmatter, so that it is not possible to define them without reference to\ntheir material parts (1036b28). Nevertheless, Aristotle\nends \u0396.11 as if he has defended the claim that definition is of\nthe form alone. Perhaps his point is that whenever it is essential to\na substance that it be made of a certain kind of matter (e.g., that\nman be made of flesh and bones, and that one \u201ccould not make a\nsaw of wool or wood,\u201d \u0397.4, 1044a28) this is in\nsome sense a formal or structural requirement. A kind of matter, after\nall, can itself be analyzed hylomorphically\u2014bronze, for example,\nis a mixture of copper and tin according to a certain ratio or formula\n(logos), which is in turn predicated of some more generic\nunderlying subject. The reference to matter in a definition will thus\nalways be to a certain kind of matter, and hence to a predicate,\nrather than a subject. At any rate, if by \u2018matter\u2019 one has\nin mind the ultimate subject alluded to in \u0396.3 (so-called\n\u2018prime matter\u2019), there will be no reference to it in any\ndefinition, \u201cfor it is indefinite\u201d\n(1037a27).\n\n\n \u0396.12 introduces a new problem about definitions\u2014the\nso-called \u201cunity of definition.\u201d The problem is this:\ndefinitions are complex (a definiens is always some combination of\nterms), so what accounts for the definiendum being one thing,\nrather than many (1037b10)? Suppose that man is defined as\ntwo-footed animal; \u201cwhy, then, is this one and not\nmany\u2014animal and two-footed?\u201d\n(1037b13\u201314). Presumably, Aristotle has in mind his\ndiscussion in \u0396.4 of such \u201caccidental unities\u201d as a\npale man. The difference cannot be that our language contains a single\nword (\u2018man\u2019) for a two-footed animal, but no single word\nfor a pale man, for Aristotle has already conceded\n(1029b28) that we might very well have had a single term\n(he suggests himation, literally \u2018cloak\u2019) for a\npale man, but that would still not make the formula \u2018pale\nman\u2019 a definition nor pale man an essence\n(1030a2).\n\nAristotle proposes a solution that applies to definitions reached by\nthe \u201cmethod of division.\u201d According to this method (see\n Aristotle\u2019s logic),\n one begins with the broadest genus containing the species to be\ndefined, and divides the genus into two sub-genera by means of some\ndifferentia. One then locates the definiendum in one of the\nsub-genera, and proceeds to divide this by another differentia, and so\non, until one arrives at the definiendum species. This is a classic\ndefinition by genus and differentia. Aristotle\u2019s proposal is\nthat \u201cthe division should take the differentia of the\ndifferentia\u201d (1038a9). For example, if one uses the\ndifferentia footed to divide the genus animal, one\nthen uses a differentia such as cloven-footed for the next\ndivision. If one divides in this way, Aristotle claims, \u201cit is\nevident that the ultimate (or completing, teleutaia)\ndifferentia will be the substance of the thing and its\ndefinition\u201d (1038a19). For each \u201cdifferentia of\na differentia\u201d entails its predecessor (being cloven-footed\nentails being footed), and so the long chain of differentiae can be\nreplaced simply by the ultimate differentia, since it entails all of\nits predecessors. As Aristotle points out, it would be redundant to\ninclude any of the differentiae in the chain other than the ultimate\none: \u201cwhen we say footed two-footed animal \u2026 we shall be\nsaying the same thing several times over\u201d\n(1038a22\u201324).\n\nThis proposal shows how a long string of differentiae in a definition\ncan be reduced to one, but it does not solve the problem of the unity\nof definition. For we are still faced with the apparent fact that\ngenus + differentia constitutes a plurality even if the differentia is\nthe ultimate, or \u201ccompleting,\u201d one. It is not surprising,\nthen, that Aristotle\n returns to the problem of unity\n later (\u0397.6) and offers a different solution.\n10. Substances and Universals\n\nAt this point, we seem to have a clear idea about the nature of\nsubstantial form as Aristotle conceives of it. A substantial form is\nthe essence of a substance, and it corresponds to a species. Since it\nis an essence, a substantial form is what is denoted by the definiens\nof a definition. Since only universals are definable, substantial\nforms are universals. That substantial forms are universals is\nconfirmed by Aristotle\u2019s comment, at the end of \u0396.8, that\n\u201cSocrates and Callias \u2026 are distinct because of their\nmatter \u2026 but the same in form\u201d\n(1034a6\u20138). For them to be the same in form is for\nthem to have the same form, i.e., for one and the same substantial\nform to be predicated of two different clumps of matter. And being\n\u201cpredicated of many\u201d is what makes something a universal\n(De Interpretatione 17a37).\n\nBut \u0396.13 throws our entire understanding into disarray. Aristotle\nbegins by returning to the candidates for the title of ousia\nintroduced in \u0396.3, and points out that having now discussed the\nclaims of the subject and the essence, it is time to consider the\nthird candidate, the universal. But the remainder of the chapter\nconsists of a barrage of arguments to the conclusion that universals\nare not substances.\n\n\u0396.13 therefore produces a fundamental tension in\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics that has fragmented his interpreters.\nSome maintain that Aristotle\u2019s theory is ultimately\ninconsistent, on the grounds that it is committed to all three of the\nfollowing propositions:\n\n\n\n\n(i)\nSubstance is form. \n\n(ii)\nForm is universal. \n\n(iii)\nNo universal is a substance.  \n\n\n\nOthers have provided interpretations according to which Aristotle does\nnot maintain all of (i)\u2013(iii), and there is a considerable\nvariety of such interpretations, too many to be canvassed here. But\nthere are two main, and opposed, lines of interpretation. According to\none, Aristotle\u2019s substantial forms are not universals after all,\nbut each belongs exclusively to the particular whose form it is, and\nthere are therefore as many substantial forms of a given kind as there\nare particulars of that kind. According to the other,\nAristotle\u2019s arguments in \u0396.13 are not intended to show that\nno universal is a substance, tout court, but some weaker\nthesis that is compatible with there being only one substantial form\nfor all of the particulars belonging to the same species. Proponents\nof particular forms (or essences) include Sellars 1957, Harter 1975,\nHartman 1977, Irwin 1988, and Witt 1989b. Opponents include Woods\n1967, Owen 1978, Code 1986, Loux 1991, and Lewis 1991.\n\nIt would be foolish to attempt to resolve this issue within the\nconfines of the present entry, as it is perhaps the largest, and most\ndisputed, single interpretative issue concerning Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics. we will, instead, mention some of the main\nconsiderations brought up on each side of this dispute, and give our\nreasons for thinking that substantial forms are universals.\n\nThe idea that substantial forms are particulars is supported by\nAristotle\u2019s claims that a substance is \u201cseparable and this\nsomething \u201d (ch\u00f4riston kai tode ti, \u0396.3),\nthat there are no universals apart from their particulars (\u0396.13),\nand that universals are not substances (\u0396.13). On the other side,\nthe idea that substantial forms are universals is supported by\nAristotle\u2019s claims that substances are, par excellence,\nthe definable entities (\u0396.4), that definition is of the universal\n(\u0396.11), and that it is impossible to define particulars\n(\u0396.15).\n\nIn our opinion, the indefinability of particulars makes it impossible\nfor substantial forms to be particulars. If there were a substantial\nform that is unique to some sensible particular, say Callias, then the\ndefinition corresponding to that form, or essence, would apply\nuniquely to Callias\u2014it would define him, which is precisely what\nAristotle says cannot be done. The question, then, is whether the\nevidence against substantial forms being universals can be countered.\nThis is less clear, but the following considerations are relevant. (1)\nAristotle\u2019s claim that a substantial form is an individual\n(tode ti) does not exclude its being a universal\n(katholou). Universals are contrasted with particulars\n(kath\u2019 hekasta), not individuals (although Aristotle\ndoes sometimes ignore the distinction between tode ti and\nkath\u2019 hekaston). What makes something a tode\nti is its being a fully determinate thing, not further\ndifferentiable; what makes something a kath\u2019 hekaston\nis its being a particular thing, unrepeatable, and not predicated of\nanything else. There is thus the possibility of a universal tode\nti\u2014a fully determinate universal not further divisible into\nlower-level universals, but predicated of numerous particulars. (2)\nThe claim that there are no universals apart from particulars needs to\nbe understood in context. When Aristotle asserts (1038b33)\nthat \u201cthere is not some animal \u2026 beyond the particular\nones (ta tina)\u201d he is just as likely to be referring to\nthe particular kinds of animals as he is to particular\nspecimens. If so, his point may be that a generic kind, such as\nanimal, is ontologically dependent on its species, and hence on the\nsubstantial forms that are the essences of those species. (3) The\narguments of \u0396.13 against the substantiality of universals are\npresented as part of a give-and-take investigation of the perplexities\ninvolved in the notion of substantial form. It is not clear,\ntherefore, whether the blanket claim \u201cNo universal is a\nsubstance\u201d is intended to be accepted without qualification.\nIndeed, a closer examination of the arguments may show that\nqualifications are required if the arguments are to be cogent. For\nexample, the argument at 1038b11\u201315 is based on the\npremise that the substance of x is peculiar (idion)\nto x. It then draws the conclusion that a universal cannot be\nthe substance of all of its instances (for it could not be\nidion to all of them), and concludes that it must be the\nsubstance \u201cof none.\u201d But note that this conclusion does\nnot say that no universal can be a substance, but only that no\nuniversal can be the substance of any of its instances (cf. Code\n1978). Aristotle\u2019s point may be that since form is predicated of\nmatter, a substantial form is predicated of various clumps of matter.\nBut it is not the substance of those clumps of matter, for it is\npredicated accidentally of them. The thing with which it is uniquely\ncorrelated, and of which it is the substance, is not one of its\ninstances, but is the substantial form itself. This\nconclusion should not be surprising in light of Aristotle\u2019s\nclaim in \u0396.6 that \u201ceach substance is one and the same as\nits essence.\u201d A universal substantial form just is that\nessence.\n11. Substance as Cause of Being\n\nIn \u0396.17 Aristotle proposes a new point of departure in his effort\nto say what sort of a thing substance is. The new idea is that a\nsubstance is a \u201cstarting-point and cause\u201d (arch\u00ea\nkai aitia, 1041a9) of being. Before looking at the\ndetails of his account, we will need to make a brief detour into\nAristotle\u2019s theory of causes. The relevant texts are\nPhysics II.3, Posterior Analytics II.11,\nand Metaphysics \u0391.3 and \u0394.2. See also the entry\non\n Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy\n and Section 2 of the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s psychology.\n\nThe word aitia (\u201ccause\u201d or, perhaps better,\n\u201cexplanation\u201d), Aristotle tells us, is \u201csaid in many\nways.\u201d In one sense, a cause is \u201cthat out of which a thing\ncomes to be, and which persists; e.g., bronze, silver, and the genus\nof these are causes of a statue or a bowl\u201d (Physics\n194b24). A cause in this sense has been traditionally\ncalled a material cause, although Aristotle himself did not\nuse this label. In a second sense, a cause is \u201cthe form \u2026\nthe account of the essence\u201d (194b27), traditionally\ncalled the formal cause. A third sense, traditionally called\nthe efficient cause, is \u201cthe primary source of change\nor rest\u201d (194b30). In this sense, Aristotle says, an\nadviser is the cause of an action, a father is the cause of his child,\nand in general the producer is the cause of the product. Fourth is\nwhat is traditionally called the final cause, which Aristotle\ncharacterizes as \u201cthe end (telos), that for which a\nthing is done\u201d (194b33). In this sense, he says,\nhealth is the cause of walking, since we might explain a\nperson\u2019s walking by saying that he walks in order to be\nhealthy\u2014health is what the walking is for. Note that,\nas in this case, \u201cthings may be causes of one another\u2014hard\nwork of fitness, and fitness of hard work\u2014although not in the\nsame sense: fitness is what hard work is for, whereas hard work is\nprinciple of motion\u201d (195a10). So hard work is the\nefficient cause of fitness, since one becomes fit by means of hard\nwork, while fitness is the final cause of hard work, since one works\nhard in order to become fit.\n\nAlthough Aristotle is careful to distinguish four different kinds of\ncause (or four different senses of \u2018cause\u2019), it is\nimportant to note that he claims that one and the same thing can be a\ncause in more than one sense. As he puts it, \u201cform, mover, and\ntelos often coincide\u201d (198a25). And in\nDe Anima he is perfectly explicit that the soul, which is the\nform or essence of a living thing, \u201cis a cause in three of the\nways we have distinguished\u201d (415b10)\u2014efficient,\nformal, and final.\n\nLet us return to Aristotle\u2019s discussion in \u0396.17. The job of\na cause or principle of being, he notes, is to explain why one thing\nbelongs to another (1041a11); that is, it is to explain\nsome predicational fact. What needs to be explained, for example, is\nwhy this is a man, or that is a house. But what kind\nof a question is this? The only thing that can be a man is a man; the\nonly thing that can be a house is a house. So we would appear to be\nasking why a man is a man, or why a house is a house, and these seem\nto be foolish questions that all have the same answer: because each\nthing is itself (1041a17\u201320). The questions must\ntherefore be rephrased by taking advantage of the possibility of a\nhylomorphic analysis. We must ask, e.g., \u201cwhy are\nthese\u2014for example, brick and stones\u2014a house?\u201d\n(1041a26). The answer Aristotle proposes is that the cause\nof being of a substance (e.g., of a house) is the form or essence that\nis predicated of the matter (e.g., of the bricks and stones) that\nconstitute that substance. The essence is not always just a formal\ncause; in some cases, Aristotle says, it is also a final cause (he\ngives the examples of a house and a bed), and in some cases an\nefficient cause (1041a29\u201330). But in any case\n\u201cwhat is being looked for is the cause in virtue of which the\nmatter is something\u2014and this is the substance\u201d\n(1041b6\u20139) and \u201cthe primary cause of its\nbeing\u201d (1041b27).\n\nNotice that the explanandum in these cases (\u201cwhy is this a\nman?\u201d or \u201cwhy is that a house?\u201d) involves a species\npredication (\u201cCallias is a man,\u201d \u201cFallingwater is a\nhouse\u201d). But the answer Aristotle proposes invokes a hylomorphic\nanalysis of these questions, in which form is predicated of matter. So\nCallias is a man because the form or essence of man is present in the\nflesh and bones that constitute the body of Callias; Fallingwater is a\nhouse because the form of house is present in the materials of which\nFallingwater is made. In general, a species predication is explained\nin terms of an underlying form predication, whose subject is not the\nparticular compound but its matter. Form predications are thus more\nbasic than their corresponding species predications. A substantial\nform, as a primary definable, is its own substance, for it is\nessentially predicated of itself alone. But the substantial form of a\nmaterial compound, because it is predicated (accidentally) of the\nmatter of the compound, is the cause of the compound\u2019s being the\nkind of thing that it is. The form is therefore, in a derivative way,\nthe substance of the compound, as well.\n12. Actuality and Potentiality\n\nIn Metaphysics \u0396, Aristotle introduces the distinction\nbetween matter and form synchronically, applying it to an individual\nsubstance at a particular time. The matter of a substance is the stuff\nit is composed of; the form is the way that stuff is put together so\nthat the whole it constitutes can perform its characteristic\nfunctions. But soon he begins to apply the distinction diachronically,\nacross time. This connects the matter/form distinction to another key\nAristotelian distinction, that between potentiality (dunamis)\nand actuality (entelecheia) or activity (energeia).\nThis distinction is the main topic of Book \u0398.\n\nAristotle distinguishes between two different senses of the term\ndunamis. In the strictest sense, a dunamis is the\npower that a thing has to produce a change. A thing has a\ndunamis in this sense when it has within it \u201ca\nstarting-point of change in another thing or in itself insofar as it\nis other\u201d (\u0398.1, 1046a12; cf. \u0394.12). The\nexercise of such a power is a kin\u00easis\u2014a movement\nor process. So, for example, the housebuilder\u2019s craft is a power\nwhose exercise is the process of housebuilding. But there is a second\nsense of dunamis\u2014and it is the one in which Aristotle\nis mainly interested\u2014that might be better translated as\n\u2018potentiality\u2019. For, as Aristotle tells us, in this sense\ndunamis is related not to movement (kin\u00easis)\nbut to activity (energeia)(\u0398.6, 1048a25). A\ndunamis in this sense is not a thing\u2019s power to produce\na change but rather its capacity to be in a different and more\ncompleted state. Aristotle thinks that potentiality so understood is\nindefinable (1048a37), claiming that the general idea can\nbe grasped from a consideration of cases. Activity is to potentiality,\nAristotle tells us, as \u201cwhat is awake is in relation to what is\nasleep, and what is seeing is in relation to what has its eyes closed\nbut has sight, and what has been shaped out of the matter is in\nrelation to the matter\u201d (1048b1\u20133).\n\nThis last illustration is particularly illuminating. Consider, for\nexample, a piece of wood, which can be carved or shaped into a table\nor into a bowl. In Aristotle\u2019s terminology, the wood has (at\nleast) two different potentialities, since it is potentially a table\nand also potentially a bowl. The matter (in this case, wood) is linked\nwith potentialty; the substance (in this case, the table or the bowl)\nis linked with actuality. The as yet uncarved wood is only potentially\na table, and so it might seem that once it is carved the wood is\nactually a table. Perhaps this is what Aristotle means, but it is\npossible that he does not wish to consider the wood to be a table. His\nidea might be that not only can a piece of raw wood in the\ncarpenter\u2019s workshop be considered a potential table (since it\ncan be transformed into one), but the wood composing the completed\ntable is also, in a sense, a potential table. The idea here is that it\nis not the wood qua wood that is actually a table, but the wood qua\ntable. Considered as matter, it remains only potentially the thing\nthat it is the matter of. (A contemporary philosopher might make this\npoint by refusing to identify the wood with the table, saying instead\nthat the wood only constitutes the table and is not identical to the\ntable it constitutes.)\n\nSince Aristotle gives form priority over matter, we would expect him\nsimilarly to give actuality priority over potentiality. And that is\nexactly what we find (\u0398.8, 1049b4\u20135). Aristotle\ndistinguishes between priority in logos (account or\ndefinition), in time, and in substance. (1) Actuality is prior in\nlogos since we must cite the actuality when we give an\naccount of its corresponding potentiality. Thus, \u2018visible\u2019\nmeans \u2018capable of being seen\u2019;\n\u2018buildable\u2019 means \u2018capable of being\nbuilt\u2019(1049b14\u201316). (2) As regards\ntemporal priority, by contrast, potentiality may well seem to be prior\nto actuality, since the wood precedes the table that is built from it,\nand the acorn precedes the oak that it grows into. Nevertheless,\nAristotle finds that even temporally there is a sense in which\nactuality is prior to potentiality: \u201cthe active that is the same\nin form, though not in number [with a potentially existing thing], is\nprior [to it]\u201d (1049b18\u201319). A particular acorn\nis, of course, temporally prior to the particular oak tree that it\ngrows into, but it is preceded in time by the actual oak tree that\nproduced it, with which it is identical in species. The seed\n(potential substance) must have been preceded by an adult (actual\nsubstance). So in this sense actuality is prior even in time.\n\n(3) Aristotle argues for the priority in substance of actuality over\npotentiality in two ways. (a) The first argument makes use of his\nnotion of final causality. Things that come to be move toward an end\n(telos)\u2014the boy becomes a man, the acorn becomes an\noak\u2014and \u201cthe activity is the end, and it is for the sake\nof this that the capacity [or potentiality] is acquired. For animals\ndo not see in order that they may have sight, rather they have sight\nin order that they may see \u2026 matter is potentially something\nbecause it may come in the form of it\u2014at any rate, when it is\nactively something, then it is in the form of it\u201d\n(1050a9\u201317). Form or actuality is the end toward\nwhich natural processes are directed. Actuality is therefore a cause\nin more than one sense of a thing\u2019s realizing its potential. As\nwe noted in Section 11, one and the same thing may be the final,\nformal, and efficient cause of another. Suppose an acorn realizes its\npotential to become an oak tree. The efficient cause here is the\nactual oak tree that produced the acorn; the formal cause is the\nlogos defining that actuality; the final cause is the\ntelos toward which the acorn develops\u2014an actual\n(mature) oak tree.\n\n(b) Aristotle also offers (1050b6\u20131051a2)\nan \u201ceven stricter\u201d argument for his claim that actuality\nis prior in substance to potentiality. A potentiality is for either of\na pair of opposites; so anything that is capable of being is also\ncapable of not being. What is capable of not being might possibly not\nbe, and what might possibly not be is perishable. Hence anything with\nthe mere potentiality to be is perishable. What is eternal is\nimperishable, and so nothing that is eternal can exist only\npotentially\u2014what is eternal must be fully actual. But the\neternal is prior in substance to the perishable. For the eternal can\nexist without the perishable, but not conversely, and that is what\npriority in substance amounts to (cf. \u0394.11, 1019a2).\nSo what is actual is prior in substance to what is potential.\n13. Unity Reconsidered\n\nIn \u0397.6, Aristotle returns to the problem of the unity of\ndefinition\n (discussed above in Section 9)\n and offers a new solution based on the concepts of potentiality and\nactuality. He begins by pointing out (recalling the language of\n\u0396.17) that the things whose unity he is trying to explain are\nthose \u201cthat have several parts and where the totality of them is\nnot like a heap, but the whole is something beyond the parts\u201d\n(1045a8\u201310). His task is to explain the unity of such\ncomplexes.\n\nThe problem is insoluble, he says, unless one realizes that\n\u201cthere is on the one hand matter and on the other shape (or\nform, morph\u00ea), and the one is potentially and the other\nactively.\u201d Once one realizes this, \u201cthen what we are\ninquiring into will no longer seem to be a puzzle\u201d\n(1045a20\u201325). He offers the following example\n(1045a26\u201335). Suppose round bronze were the\ndefinition of \u2018cloak\u2019. If someone were to ask \u201cwhat\nmakes a cloak one thing, a unity?\u201d the answer would be obvious.\nFor bronze is the matter, and roundness is the form. The bronze is\npotentially round, and round is what the bronze actually is when it\nhas received this form. The cause of the unity of the cloak (in this\nsense of \u2018cloak\u2019) is just the cause of bronze being made\nround. Since the cloak is something that was produced, or brought into\nbeing, there is no cause of its unity other than the agent who put the\nform into the matter. Bronze (the matter) is a potential sphere, and\nthe cloak is an actual sphere. But round bronze is equally\nthe essence of both the actual sphere and the potential one. The\nbronze and the roundness are not two separate things. The bronze is\npotentially a sphere, and when it is made round it constitutes an\nactual one\u2014a single sphere of bronze.\n\nIt is easy to see how this hylomorphic analysis explains the unity of\na substantial material particular, since neither the matter nor the\nform of such a particular is by itself a single material individual,\nand it is only when they are taken together that they constitute such\nan individual. But the question Aristotle is trying to answer is this:\n\u201cwhy on earth is something one when the account of it is what we\ncall a defnition?\u201d (\u0396.12, 1037b11). Since proper\ndefinables are universals, it remains to be seen how the proposed\nsolution applies to them. After all, universals are not material\nobjects, and so it is not clear how they can be viewed as hylomorphic\ncompounds. But Aristotle has at his disposal a concept that can fill\nthis bill perfectly, viz., the concept of intelligible matter\n(hul\u00ea no\u00eat\u00ea). (The main purpose of\nintelligible matter is to provide something quasi-material for pure\ngeometrical objects that are not realized in bronze or stone, for\nexample, to be made of.) So we surmise that it is for this reason that\nAristotle goes on (1045a33) to introduce matter into the\ncurrent context. If this is so, we may conclude that the material\ncomponent in the definition of a species is intelligible matter.\nElsewhere, he explicitly describes genus as matter: \u201cthe genus\nis the matter of what it is said to be the genus of\u201d (\u0399.8,\n1058a23). So a species too, although it is not itself a material\nobject, can be considered a hylomorphic compound. Its matter is its\ngenus, which is only potentially the species defined; its differentia\nis the form that actualizes the matter. The genus does not actually\nexist independently of its species any more than bronze exists apart\nfrom all form. The genus animal, for example, is just that\nwhich is potentially some specific kind of animal or other. Aristotle\nconcludes (1045b17\u201321) that \u201cthe ultimate\nmatter and the form (morph\u00ea) are one and the same, the\none potentially, the other actively \u2026 and what potentially is\nand what actively is are in a way one.\u201d\n\nThis solution, of course, applies only to hylomorphic compounds. But\nthat is all it needs to do, according to Aristotle. For he ends the\nchapter by claiming that the problem of unity does not arise for other\nkinds of compounds that are not material: \u201cThings that have no\nmatter \u2026 are all unconditionally just what is a one\u201d\n(1045b23).\n14. Theology\n\nThe science of being qua being is a science of form. But it is also\ntheology, the science of god. The question now is, how can it be both?\nAnd to it Aristotle gives a succinct answer:\n\nIf there is some immovable substance, this [that is, theological\nphilosophy] will be prior and will be primary philosophy, and it will\nbe universal in this way, namely, because it is primary. And it will\nbelong to it to get a theoretical grasp on being qua being, both what\nit is and the things that belong to it insofar as it is being. (E.1,\n1026a29\u201332)\n\n\nSo the primacy of theology, which is based on the fact that it deals\nwith substance that is eternal, immovable, and separable, is\nsupposedly what justifies us in treating it as the universal science\nof being qua being.\n\nA reminder, first, of what this primacy is. As we saw in Sections 2\u20133\nabove, only beings in the category of substance are separable, so that\nthey alone enjoy a sort of ontological priority that is both\nexistential and explanatory. Thus walking and being healthy are\ncharacterized as \u201cincapable of being separated,\u201d on the\ngrounds that there is some particular substantial underlying subject\nof which they are predicated (Z.1, 1028a20\u201331).\nOften, indeed, separability is associated with being such a subject:\n\u201cThe underlying subject is prior, which is why the substance is\nprior\u201d (\u0394.11, 1019a5\u20136); \u201cIf we do\nnot posit substances to be separated, and in the way in which\nparticular things are said to be separated, we will do away with the\nsort of substance we wish to maintain\u201d (M.10,\n1086b16\u201319). Similarly, not being separable is\nassociated with being predicated of such a subject: \u201cAll other\nthings are either said of primary substances as subjects or in them as\nsubjects. Therefore, if there were no primary substances, there could\nnot be anything else\u201d (Cat. 2b3\u20136).\nThe starting-points and causes of all beings, then, must be\nsubstances. But for all that has been shown so far, the universe could\nstill be made up of lots of separate substances having little\nontologically to do with each other.\n\nHere it may serve to return to Z.3, which opens by calling attention\nto something said (legomenon) about substance, namely\nthat:\n\nSomething is said to be (legetai) substance, if not in more\nways, at any rate most of all in four. For the essence, the universal,\nand the genus seem to be the substance of each thing, and fourth of\nthese, the underlying subject. (1028b33\u201336)\n\n\nSince \u201cthe primary underlying subject seems most of all to be\nsubstance\u201d (1029a1\u20132), because what is said or\npredicated of it depends on it, the investigation begins with this\nsubject, quickly isolating three candidates: the matter, the compound\nof matter and form, and the form itself (1029a2\u20133),\nwhich is identical to essence (1032b1\u20132). Almost as\nquickly (1029a7\u201332), the first two candidates are at\nleast provisionally excluded. A\u2014perhaps the\u2014major\nground for their exclusion is the primacy dilemma, which we\nshall now briefly investigate.\n\nThe philosophical background to the dilemma is this. If you are a\nrealist about scientific knowledge and truth, as Aristotle is, the\nstructure of your scientific theories must mirror the structure of\nreality, so that scientific starting-points or first principles, must\nalso be the basic building blocks of reality. Suppose that this is not\nso. Suppose that your physics tells you that atoms are the basic\nbuilding blocks of reality and that your psychology tells you that\nsense-perceptions are the starting-points of scientific knowledge.\nThen you will face a very severe problem, that of skepticism. For a\nwedge can be driven between the starting-points of scientific\nknowledge and reality\u2019s basic building blocks. Ren\u00e9\nDescartes\u2019 famous dreaming argument is one familiar form such a\nwedge might take. Your sense-perceptions are consistent with your\nbeing always asleep and having a very detailed dream.\n\nIn B.6, Aristotle introduces a similar problem about the relation\nbetween our scientific representation of the world and how the world\nin itself is structured:\n\nWe must \u2026 ask whether [the starting-points] are universal or\nexist in the way we say particulars do. For if they are universal,\nthey will not be substances. For no common thing signifies a this\nsomething but a such-and-such sort of thing, whereas substance is a\nthis something.\u2026 If then the starting-points are universals,\nthese things follow. But if they are not universals, but [exist] as\nparticulars, they will not be scientifically knowable. For scientific\nknowledge of all things is universal. Thus there will be other\nstarting-points prior to the starting-points, namely, those that are\npredicated universally, if indeed there is going to be scientific\nknowledge of these. (1003a7\u201317)\n\n\nThe basic building blocks of reality, (Aristotelian) science tells us,\nare particular matter-form compounds. Yet science\u2019s own\nstarting-points are the forms\u2014the universal essences\u2014of\nsuch things. There is no science of you, or of me, though there is one\nof human beings. How, then, can science possibly be reflecting\naccurately the structure of reality, when its starting-points and\nthose of reality fail so radically to map onto each other? For there\nis no greater difference, it seems, than that between particulars and\nuniversals. The thing to do, then, given that science provides our\nbest access to the nature of reality, is to investigate the universal\nforms or essences that are basic to it.\n\nAristotle begins the investigation with the most familiar and widely\nrecognized case, which is the form or essence present in sublunary\nmatter-form compounds. It is announced in Z.3\n(1029b3\u201312), but not begun until some chapters later\nand not really completed until the end of \u0398.5. And by then it is\nwith actuality (entelecheia) or activity (energeia)\nthat form is identified, and matter with potentiality. The science of\nbeing qua being can legitimately focus on form, or actuality, then, as\nthe factor common to all substances, and so to all the beings. But\nunless it can be shown that there is some explanatory connection\nbetween the forms of all these substances, the non-fragmentary nature\nof being itself will still not have been established, and the pictures\ngiven to us by the various sciences will, so to speak, be separate\npictures, and the being they collectively portray, divided.\n\nThe next stage in the unification of being, and the legitimation of\nthe science dealing with it qua being, is effected by an argument in\n\u039b.6 that trades on the identification of form with actuality\nand matter with potentiality:\n\nIf there is something that is capable of moving things or acting on\nthem, but that is not actively doing so, there will not [necessarily]\nbe movement, since it is possible for what has a capacity not to\nactivate it. There is no benefit, therefore, in positing eternal\nsubstances, as those who accept the Forms do, unless there is to be\npresent in them some starting-point that is capable of causing change.\nMoreover, even this is not enough, and neither is another substance\nbeyond the Forms. For if it will not be active, there will not be\nmovement. Further, even if it will be active, it is not enough, if the\nsubstance of it is a capacity. For then there will not be\neternal movement, since what is potentially may possibly not\nbe. There must, therefore, be such a starting-point, the very\nsubstance of which is activity. Further, accordingly, these substances\nmust be without matter. For they must be eternal, if indeed\nanything else is eternal. Therefore they must be activity.\n(1071b12\u201322)\n\n\nMatter-form compounds are, as such, capable of movement and change.\nThe canonical examples of them\u2014perhaps the only genuine or fully\nfledged ones\u2014are living metabolizing beings (Z.17,\n1041b29\u201330). But if these beings are to be actual,\nthere must be substances whose very essence is\nactivity\u2014substances that do not need to be activated by\nsomething else.\n\nWith matter-form compounds shown to be dependent on substantial\nactivities for their actual being, a further element of vertical\nunification is introduced into beings, since layer-wise the two sorts\nof substances belong together. Laterally, though, disunity continues\nto threaten. For as yet nothing has been done to exclude the\npossibility of each compound substance having a distinct substantial\nactivity as its own unique activator. Being, in that case, would be a\nset of ordered pairs, the first member of which would be a substantial\nactivity, the second a matter-form compound, with all its dependent\nattributes.\n\nIn Metaphysics \u039b.8 Aristotle initially takes a step in\nthe direction of such a bipartite picture. He asks how many\nsubstantial activities are required to explain astronomical phenomena,\nsuch as the movements of the stars and planets, and answers that there\nmust be forty-nine of them (1074a16). But these forty-nine\nare coordinated with each other so as to form a system. And what\nenables them to do so, and to constitute a single heaven, is that\nthere is a single prime mover of all of them:\n\nIt is evident that there is but one heaven. For if there are many, as\nthere are many human beings, the starting-point for each will be one\nin form but in number many. But all things that are many in number\nhave matter, for one and the same account applies to many, for\nexample, human beings, whereas Socrates is one. But the primary\nessence does not have matter, since it is an actuality. The primary\nimmovable mover, therefore, is one both in account and in number. And\nso, therefore, is what is moved always and continuously. Therefore,\nthere is only one heaven. (1074a31\u201338)\n\n\nWhat accounts for the unity of the heaven, then, is that the movements\nin it are traceable back to a single cause: the prime or primary\nmover.\n\nLeaving aside the question of just how this primary mover moves what\nit moves directly, the next phase in the unification of beings is the\none in which the sublunary world is integrated with the already\nunified superlunary one studied by astronomy. This takes place in\n\u039b.10. One obvious indication of this unification is the\ndependence of the reproductive cycles of plants and animals on the\nseasons, and their dependence, in turn, on the movements of the sun\nand moon (\u039b.5, 1071a13\u201316). And beyond even\nthis there is the unity of the natural world itself, which is\nmanifested in the ways in which its inhabitants are adapted to each\nother:\n\nAll things are jointly organized in a way, although not in the same\nway\u2014even swimming creatures, flying creatures, and plants. And\nthe organization is not such that one thing has no relation to another\nbut rather there is a relation. For all things are jointly organized\nin relation to one thing\u2014but it is as in a household, where the\nfree men least of all do things at random, but all or most of the\nthings they do are organized, while the slaves and beasts can do a\nlittle for the common thing, but mostly do things at random. For this\nis the sort of starting-point that the nature is of each of them. I\nmean, for example, that all must at least come to be disaggregated\n[into their elements]; and similarly there are other things which they\nall share for the whole. (1075a16\u201325)\n\n\nThus the sublunary realm is sufficiently integrated with the\nsuperlunary one that we can speak of them as jointly having a nature\nand a ruler, and as being analogous to an army (1075a13)\nand a household (1075a22).\n\nWe may agree, then, that the divine substances in the superlunary\nrealm and the compound substances in the sublunary one have prima\nfacie been vertically integrated into a single explanatory system. As\na result, when we look at the form of a sublunary matter-form\ncompound, we will find in it the mark of a superlunary activator, just\nas we do in the case of the various heavenly bodies, and, as in the\nline of its efficient causes, we find \u201cthe sun and its movement\nin an inclined circle\u201d (1071a15\u201316). Still\nawaiting integration, though, are mathematical objects, such as\nnumbers. But in Books M and N these are shown to be not substantial\nstarting-points and causes but abstractions from perceptible sublunary\nbeings\u2014they are dependent entities, in other words, rather than\nself-subsistent ones. Similarly, in Physics II.2 we read:\n\nThe mathematician too busies himself about these things [planes,\nsolids, lines, and points], although not insofar as each of them is\nthe limit of a natural body, nor does he get a theoretical grasp on\nthe coincidents of natural bodies insofar as they are such. That is\nwhy he separates them. For they are separable in the understanding\nfrom movement, and so their being separated makes no difference, nor\ndoes any falsehood result from it. (193b31\u201335)\n\n\nThis completes the vertical and horizontal unification of being:\nattributes depend on substances, substantial matter-form compounds\ndepend on substantial forms, or activities, numbers depend on\nmatter-form compounds.\n\nBeings are not said to be \u201cin accord with one thing,\u201d\ntherefore, as they would be if they formed a single first-order genus,\nbut \u201cwith reference to one thing,\u201d namely, a divine\nsubstance that is in essence an activity. And it is this more complex\nunity, compatible with generic diversity, and a genuine multiplicity\nof distinct first-order sciences, but just as robust and well\ngrounded, that grounds and legitimates the science of being qua being\nas a single science dealing with a genuine object of study (\u0393.2,\n1003b11\u201316). The long argument that leads to this\nconclusion is thus a sort of proof of the existence, and so of the\npossibility, of the science on which the Metaphysics focuses.\nIt is also the justification for the claim, which we looked at before,\nthat the science of being qua being is in fact theology\n(1026a27\u201332).\n\nThere, then, in the starry heavens above us, are the forty-nine\ncelestial spheres, all moving eternally in fixed circular orbits. The\noutermost one, which contains all the others, is the primary heaven.\nQuestions immediately arise: (i) how is the primary heaven moved by\nthe primary mover, the primary god? Aristotle gives his response in\n\u039b.7:\n\nThere is something [namely, the primary heaven,] that is always moved\nwith an unceasing movement, which is in a circle (and this is clear\nnot from argument alone but also from the facts). So the primary\nheaven would be eternal. There is, therefore, also something that\nmoves it [namely, the primary god]. But since what is moved and moves\nsomething is something medial, there is something that moves without\nbeing moved, being eternal, substance, and activity. This, though, is\nthe way the object of desire and the intelligible object move things:\nthey move them without being moved. Of these objects, the primary ones\nare the same. (1072a21\u201327)\n\n\nThus the primary heaven is moved by the primary god, in the way that\nwe are moved by a good that we desire. (That this heaven, as well as\nthe other heavenly bodies, are therefore alive is argued for in De\nCaelo II.12.) But (ii) how can the primary god be such a good?\nMoreover, (iii) why is he not moved by something else again?\n\nThe answer to question (ii) is also found in \u039b.7:\n\nActive understanding, though, is intrinsically of what is\nintrinsically best, and the sort that is to the highest degree best is\nof what is to the highest degree best. The understanding actively\nunderstands itself by partaking of the intelligible object. (For it\nbecomes an intelligible object by touching and understanding one, so\nthat understanding and intelligible object are the same.) For what is\nreceptive of the intelligible object and of the substance is the\nunderstanding, and it is active when it possesses it, so that this\nrather than that seems to be the divine thing that understanding\npossesses, and contemplation seems to be most pleasant and best. If,\nthen, that good state [of activity], which we are sometimes in, the\n[primary] god is always in, that is a wonderful thing, and if to a\nhigher degree, that is yet more wonderful. But that is his state. And\nlife, too, certainly belongs to him. For the activity of understanding\nis life, and he is that activity; and his intrinsic activity is life\nthat is best and eternal. (1072b18\u201328)\n\n\nWhat the primary heaven is moved by, then, is the wish to be in the\ngood state of active contemplation that we, when we are happiest, are\nin, and that the primary god is always in because he just is\nthat activity. Just as we seek the good that the primary god is, so\ntoo does the primary heaven and its forty-eight celestial\ncompanions.\n\nThis brings us to question (iii). When the understanding is actively\ncontemplating something, that something\u2014that intelligible\nobject\u2014is what activates it. So why isn\u2019t that object yet\nmore primary than the primary god? Aristotle gives his answer in\n\u039b.9; the reasoning, though compressed, should now be fairly\nreadily intelligible:\n\nWhat does it [the primary god] understand? For it is either itself or\nsomething else. And if something else, then either always the same\nthing or sometimes this and sometimes that. Does it, then, make a\ndifference or none at all whether it actively understands the good or\nsome random object? Or are there not certain things that it would be\nabsurd for it to think of? It is clear, therefore, that it actively\nunderstands what is most divine and most estimable and does not change\n[its object], since change would be for the worse, and would already\nbe a sort of movement. First, then, if its substance is not active\nunderstanding but rather a capacity [to understand], \u2026 it is\nclear that something else would be more estimable than the\nunderstanding, namely, what is understood. And indeed [the capacity]\nto understand and active understanding will belong even to someone who\nactively understands the worst thing, so that if this is to be avoided\n(for there are in fact some things that it is better not to see than\nto see), the active understanding would not be the best thing. It is\nitself, therefore, that it understands, if indeed it is the most\nexcellent thing, and the active understanding is active understanding\nof active understanding (h\u00ea no\u00easis\nno\u00ease\u00f4s no\u00easis). (1074b22\u201335)\n\n\nGod is the understanding that understands himself, because his\nunderstanding is like ours would be if we imagine it as being the\nintelligible equivalent of seeing light without seeing any other\nvisible object. From the inside, then, from the point of view of the\nsubject experiencing it, it is a state of consciousness of a sort\nfamiliar from the writings of the great religious mystics, in which\nboth subject and object disappear from an awareness that yet remains\nfully and truly attentive, fully alive and joyous. Insofar as we have\nany experience-based evidence of what a beatific state is like, this\none surely approximates to it. Were we to experience it or something\nlike it, then, there is some reason to think that we would agree that\nit is bliss indeed, blessed happiness unalloyed. This is the\nconclusion Aristotle himself comes to and defends in Nicomachean\nEthics X.6\u20138. Practical wisdom and theoretical wisdom, it\nfollows, have the same ultimate starting-point, the same first\nprinciple, so that wisdom, too, is something unified.\n\nGo back now to the primacy dilemma and notice that its resolution is\nwithin our grasp, though one might be forgiven for not readily\nunderstanding Aristotle\u2019s statement of it in M.10:\n\nThe fact that all scientific knowledge is universal, so that the\nstarting-points of beings must also be universal and not separate\nsubstances, involves the greatest puzzle of those mentioned. But\nthough there is surely a way in which what is said is true, there is\nanother way in which it is not true. For scientific knowledge, like\nknowing scientifically, is twofold, one potential, the other active:\nthe capacity [or potential], being as matter, universal and\nindefinite, is of what is universal and indefinite, whereas the\nactivity, being definite, is of what is definite\u2014being a this\nsomething of a this something. But it is only coincidentally that\nsight sees universal color, because this [particular instance of]\ncolor that it sees is a color, and so what the grammarian\ntheoretically grasps, namely, this [particular instance of] A, is an\nA. For if the starting-points must be universal, what comes from them\nmust also be universal, as in the case of demonstrations. And if this\nis so, there will be nothing separable and no substance either.\nHowever, in one way scientific knowledge is universal, but in another\nit is not. (1087a10\u201325)\n\n\nThe idea is this. Since forms or essences are universals, you and I\nmay both know the same form, as we may both know the letter A. But\nwhen I actively know or contemplate that universal form, what is now\nbefore my mind is a particular: this actualization of that universal.\nNow consider the primary god. He is eternally and essentially the\nobject of the active understanding that he is. So he is a substantial\nparticular. But since he is essentially an activity, he is also a\nuniversal essence of a special sort\u2014one that can only be actual,\nnever merely potential. In a way, then, the primary god overcomes the\ndifference between particulars and universals that seemed\nunbridgeable. For he is at once a concrete particular and the\nstarting-point of all scientific knowledge. He thereby unifies not\njust being, but the scientific knowledge of it as well, insuring that\nthe latter fits the former in the way that realism requires.\n15.
