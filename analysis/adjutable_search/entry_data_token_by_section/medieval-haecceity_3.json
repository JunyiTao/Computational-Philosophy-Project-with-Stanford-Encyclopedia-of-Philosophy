    "main_text": "Later medieval and early modern accounts of haecceities\n4. Later medieval and early modern accounts of haecceities\n\nAcceptance of haecceities is a distinctive feature of the thought of\nmany followers of Scotus, though there are some sixteenth-century\nscholastics who accept haecceities without accepting many other\ndistinctively Scotist teachings. Having said this, some early\nfollowers of Scotus reject haecceities and the theory of the common\nnature altogether, and of those who accept haecceities, some found the\ncorrect understanding of the nature of the distinction between an\nindividual\u2019s nature and its haecceity a troublesome matter. One of the\nearliest Scotists, Francis of Meyronnes, writing his commentary on the\nSentences around 1320, accepts the theory of the\nnon-numerical unity of common natures (In Sent. II, d. 34, q.\n3 [Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 157rbG]), and the claim\nthat individuation is by haecceity (In Sent. II, d. 34, q. 4\n[Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 157vaK-L]; I, d. 3, q. 4\n[Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 18raA]). But he holds that it\nis inappropriate to talk of a formal distinction in this context.\nFormal distinction obtains only between things that have some sort of\nquidditative content (In Sent. I, d. 8, q. 5 [(1520),\n48vbQ-49raB]). Haecceities have no such\nquidditative content (In Sent. I, d. 8, q. 5 [(1520),\n48rbG]), and thus cannot be formally distinct from their\nnature. Rather, a haecceity is modally distinct from its\nnature (In Sent. II, d. 34, q. 3 [(1520),\n157vaL]). A modal distinction, according to Meyronnes,\nobtains between a thing and an intrinsic mode of that thing, where an\nintrinsic mode is something which \u201cwhen added to a thing does\nnot vary its formal definition \u2026 since it does not of itself\nimply any quiddity or formal definition\u201d (In Sent. I,\nd. 42, q. 3 [(1520), 120vaL; 120vbO]; see too\nIn Sent. I, d. 8, q. 5 [(1520), 49rbE]). A\nhaecceity does not affect a thing\u2019s kind; it is thus an\nintrinsic mode of the thing.\n\nIt may look as though this is just a terminological shift, but it is\nnot so in at least the following way: a modal distinction is a lesser\nkind of distinction than a formal distinction. Formal distinctions\nobtain between genus and specific difference; thus, the difference\nbetween species/nature and haecceity, for Meyronnes, is less than the\ndifference between genus and difference. Scotus, contrariwise, makes\nno such distinction between degrees of difference in this context (for\nthis contrast between the two thinkers, see Dumont [1987], 18). Still,\nwithout some principled way of spelling out degrees of difference,\nthis contrast between Scotus and Meyronnes amounts to nothing of any\nphilosophical interest. To this extent the difference between the two\nthinkers might as well be merely terminological, and Meyronnes needs\nto do more work if he is to make any significant philosophical point\nhere.\n\nAmongst baroque scholastics, the most notable adherent of haecceities\nis the Jesuit Peter Fonseca (1528\u20131599), whose monumental\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (Fonseca [1599])\nincludes an extensive discussion of haecceities. (Fonseca, with\nsomething of a humanist background, worries about the barbarous nature\nof Scotus\u2019s neologism, and suggests in passing that \u2018haeccity\u2019\n[haeccitas] would have been a more comfortable formulation\n[In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 1 (Fonseca [1599], vol. 2, col.\n381D)] \u2013 compare \u2018quiddity.\u2019) Like many of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth-century scholastics, Fonseca \u2013 most\nnotable for coming up with a theory of divine \u201cmiddle\nknowledge\u201d at much the same time as Molina \u2013 is not a\nfollower of any one earlier philosopher, preferring to learn from any\nof his predecessors on various points as he sees fit. According to\nFonseca,\n\nthe principle of individuation is a certain positive difference,\nprimarily incommunicable, which, when added to the species, in itself\nconstitutes the individual \u2026 which difference others call\nhaecceities. (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 1\n[Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 181C-D])\n\n\nFonseca engages particularly with the rejection of haecceities in the\nThomist Cajetan (most notably in Cajetan\u2019s commentary on Aquinas\u2019s\nDe ente, c. 2, q. 5, nn. 33\u201336 (Cajetan [CBE],\n94\u201398)). Cajetan worries that haecceities need to be in some\nsense similar to each other \u2013 and specifically that the\nhaecceities of Socrates and Plato must be more similar than the\nhaecceities of Plato and some white patch (Cajetan, In de\nente, c. 2, q. 5, n. 36 (Cajetan [CBE], 97); see Fonseca, In\nMet. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col.\n185C-D]). According to Fonseca, haecceities are similar to each other\nwithout having anything real in common: they are thus primarily\ndiverse in the required sense, even though the haecceities of Socrates\nand Plato are more similar than the haecceities of Plato and some\nwhite patch (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca\n(1599), vol. 2, col. 185E-F]). More generally, Fonseca (rightly) holds\nthat exact similarity between two haecceities would entail that the\ntwo haecceities were numerically identical (Fonseca, In Met.\nV, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 185B]).\n\nFonseca is convinced of the reality of haecceities because he accepts\nthe view that common natures have in themselves a certain sort of\nunity prior to instantiation. Fonseca proposes that, in order to have\nreal existence, something needs to be added to the nature \u2013 a\nhaecceity (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca\n(1599), vol. 2, col. 966A]). Again, Fonseca\u2019s discussion is informed\nby the criticisms of Cajetan, though in this case the position that\nCajetan adopts on the question of the unity of the common\nnature seems closer to the broadly Thomist and Scotist tradition than\nthat proposed by Fonseca. In other words, Fonseca adopts an account of\nthe common nature that seems quite distinct from the closely related\nviews of Aquinas and Scotus. To this extent, Fonseca\u2019s account\nrepresents an acceptance of haecceities in the context of a theory of\nuniversals that is not really Scotist. According to Cajetan, common\nnatures in themselves have \u201cformal\u201d unity: indivisibility\ninto further more specific kinds, compatible with division into\nnumerically many instances or subjective parts (Cajetan [CBE], nn.\n134\u2013155 [nn. 55\u201362]; see Fonseca, In Met. V, c.\n28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 967B, D-E]). Fonseca\nagrees that the nature must have this formal unity \u2013 a unity\nthat he identifies as Scotus\u2019s less-than-numerical unity (Fonseca,\nIn Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col.\n968A]). But, in addition to this unity, he holds that the nature has a\nproper unity of its own that cannot be communicated to its\ninstantiations. This unity is numerical, and belongs to the\nnature absolutely (unqualifiedly) (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 28,\nq. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 968A]). The reason is\nthat, if a nature lacked such additional unity, then it would not be\npossible to speak of (say) humanity as just one species. After all,\nthe formal unity of the nature is compatible with division into\nnumerically many instances; some other unity must be the basis for the\nassertion that humanity is not many natures or species (Fonseca,\nIn Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 1 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col.\n959F]). The picture is admittedly not entirely clear, but Fonseca\u2019s\ndistinction of instantiable from non-instantiable unity is presumably\nsupposed to explain how there can be some unity proper to common\nnatures; this unity is distinguished from instantiable unity, and it\nis the existence of haecceities that explains how the instantiable\nunity is in fact instantiated.\n",
