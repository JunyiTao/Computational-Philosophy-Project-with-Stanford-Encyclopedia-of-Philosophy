    "main_text": "Answering the Evaluation Question || Is Manipulation Always Wrong?\n3.1 Is Manipulation Always Wrong?\n\nSuppose that Tonya is a captured terrorist who has hidden a bomb in\nthe city and that her preferred course of action is to keep its\nlocation secret until it explodes. And suppose that Irving is an FBI\ninterrogator who wants Tonya to reveal the bomb\u2019s location\nbefore it explodes. How would this way filling in the details of the\ncase change our moral assessment of the various ways that Irving might\ninduce Tonya to change her mind?\n\nOne rather extreme answer would be: \u201cnot at all\u201d. This\nhardline view would hold that manipulation is always morally wrong, no\nmatter what the consequences. Inasmuch as this hardline view resembles\nKant\u2019s notorious hardline position that lying is always wrong,\none might look to Kant\u2019s ethics for considerations to support\nit. But just as hardly anyone accepts Kant\u2019s hardline position\nagainst lying, the hardline view against manipulation also seems short\non defenders.\n\nA less extreme position would be that while manipulation is always\npro tanto wrong, other moral considerations can sometimes\noutweigh the pro tanto wrongness of manipulation. Thus, we\nmight think that manipulation is always wrong to some extent, but that\ncountervailing moral factors might sometimes suffice to make\nmanipulation justified on balance. What might such factors include?\nOne obvious candidate would be consequences\u2014for example, the\nfact that Irving\u2019s successful manipulation of Tonya would save\nmany innocent lives. Non-consequentialist factors might also be\nthought to be countervailing considerations: Perhaps the immorality of\nTonya\u2019s character, or the fact that she is acting on an evil\ndesire or intention, is a countervailing factor that can outweigh the\npro tanto wrongness of Irving\u2019s manipulation. It is\nimportant to note that, on this view, the fact that an action involves\nmanipulation is always a moral reason to avoid it, even if stronger\ncountervailing considerations render it not wrong on balance. For\nexample, even if Irving\u2019s manipulation of Terrorist Tonya is not\nwrong on balance (e.g., because of the innocent lives that will be\nsaved), if Irving can get Tonya to reveal the bomb\u2019s location\nwithout manipulation (or anything else that is comparably immoral),\nthen it would be morally better to avoid manipulating her.\n\nBy contrast, we might hold that manipulation is merely prima\nfacie immoral. On this view, there is a presumption that\nmanipulation is immoral, but this presumption can be defeated in some\nsituations. When the presumption is defeated, manipulation is\nnot wrong at all (i.e., not even pro tanto wrong). On this\nview, we might say that while manipulation is usually wrong, it is not\nwrong at all in the terrorist scenario. On this view, not only is\nIrving\u2019s manipulation of Terrorist Tonya not wrong on balance,\nbut there is not even any moral reason for him to choose a\nnon-manipulative method of getting Tonya to reveal the bomb\u2019s\nlocation if one is available.\n\nA more complex\u2014but, perhaps, ultimately more\nplausible\u2014view would combine the prima facie and\npro tanto approaches. Such a view would hold that\nmanipulation is prima facie immoral, but that when it is\nwrong, the wrongness is pro tanto rather than absolute. On\nthis view, there are situations in which the presumption against\nmanipulation is defeated and manipulation is not even pro\ntanto wrong. Perhaps bluffing in poker is like this. But where\nthe presumption is not defeated, the wrongness of manipulation is only\npro tanto, and thus able to be outweighed by sufficiently\nweighty countervailing moral considerations. In such cases, even if it\nis not wrong on balance to manipulate, it would still be morally\npreferable to avoid manipulation in favor of some other, morally\nlegitimate, form of influence. Manipulating a friend into refraining\nfrom sending a text to rekindle an abusive relationship might be an\nexample where the pro tanto wrongness of manipulation is\noutweighed by other considerations. In such a case, it seems plausible\nto maintain that it would be morally preferable to use reason rather\nthan manipulation to get one\u2019s friend to see that sending the\ntext would be a mistake, even if the facts of the situation would\njustify resorting to manipulation. A view along these lines has been\ndefended by Marcia Baron (2014: 116\u201317). Although this view is\nfar less absolute than the hardline view, it retains the claim that\nmanipulation is prima facie wrong, so that there is always a\npresumption that it is immoral, though this presumption is sometimes\ndefeated. It is also compatible with the idea that the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d has built into it a connotation of moral\ndis-approbation.\n\nHowever, the claim that manipulation is presumptively wrong might be\nchallenged. One might argue that \u201cmanipulation\u201d is, or at\nleast should be, a morally neutral term without even the presumption\nof immorality. On this view, whether a given instance of manipulation\nis immoral will always depend on the facts of the situation, and the\nterm itself includes (or should include) no presumption one way or the\nother. Clearly there are non-moralized notions of manipulation. When\nwe speak of a scientist manipulating variables in an experiment, or a\npilot manipulating the plane\u2019s controls, our use of the term is\ndevoid of any hint of moral opprobrium. In the social sciences, we can\nfind cases of the term \u201cmanipulation\u201d being used in a\nmorally neutral way even when another person is the target of\nmanipulation. For example, several papers by the evolutionary\npsychologist David M. Buss and colleagues use the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d more or less as a synonym for\n\u201cinfluence\u201d in their discussions of how humans influence\nthe behavior of other humans (D.M. Buss 1992; D.M. Buss et al. 1987).\nOf course, pointing out morally neutral usages of\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d does not really settle the question of\nwhether we should prefer a moralized or a non-moralized notion of\nmanipulation. An argument for preferring a non-moralized notion of\nmanipulation is provided by Allen Wood, who writes that\n\n\nIf we think that moral argument should proceed not merely by invoking\nour pro- or con- sentiments, or appealing to our unargued intuitions,\nbut instead by identifying objective facts about a situation that give\nus good reasons for condemning or approving certain things, then we\nwould generally do much better to use a non-moralized sense of words\nlike \u201ccoercion\u201d, \u201cmanipulation\u201d, and\n\u201cexploitation\u201d\u2014a sense in which these words can be\nused to refer to such objective facts. (Wood 2014: 19\u201320)\n\n\nNo matter how we answer the question of whether manipulation in\ngeneral is absolutely immoral, prima facie immoral, pro\ntanto immoral, or not even presumptively immoral, there are\nclearly situations in which manipulation is immoral. Any complete\nanswer to the evaluation question must explain why manipulation is\nimmoral in those cases where it is immoral. In addition, any view that\nholds that manipulation is only pro tanto and/or prima\nfacie immoral should tell us what sorts of considerations can\ndefeat the presumption that it is immoral and/or outweigh its pro\ntanto immorality. Several accounts have been offered to identify\nthe source of the moral wrongfulness of manipulation (when it is\nwrong).\n",
