    "main_text": "The Intuitive Distinction || Kant\n1.1 Kant\n\nAlthough there are precursors of the contemporary notion of the\nanalytic in Leibniz, and in Locke and Hume in their talk of\n\u201crelations of ideas,\u201d the conception that currently\nconcerns many philosophers has its roots in the work of Kant (1787\n[1998]) who, at the beginning of his Critique of Pure Reason,\nwrote:\n\n\nIn all judgments in which the relation of a subject to the predicate\nis thought (if I only consider affirmative judgments, since the\napplication to negative ones is easy) this relation is possible in two\ndifferent ways. Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A as\nsomething that is (covertly) contained in this concept A; or B lies\nentirely outside the concept A, though to be sure it stands in\nconnection with it. In the first case, I call the judgment analytic,\nin the second synthetic. (1787 [1998], B10)\n\n\nHe provided as an example of an analytic judgment, \u201cAll bodies\nare extended\u201d: in thinking of a body we can\u2019t help but\nalso think of it being extended in space; that would seem to be just\npart of what is meant by \u201cbody.\u201d He contrasted this with\n\u201cAll bodies are heavy,\u201d where the predicate (\u201cis\nheavy\u201d) \u201cis something entirely different from that which I\nthink in the mere concept of body in general\u201d (B11), and we must\nput together, or \u201csynthesize,\u201d the different concepts,\nbody and heavy (sometimes such concepts are called\n\u201campliative,\u201d \u201camplifying\u201d a concept beyond\nwhat is \u201ccontained\u201d in it).\n\nKant tried to spell out his \u201ccontainment\u201d metaphor for the\nanalytic in two ways. To see that any of set II is true, he wrote,\n\u201cI need only to analyze the concept, i.e., become conscious of\nthe manifold that I always think in it, in order to encounter this\npredicate therein\u201d (B10). But then, picking up a suggestion of\nLeibniz, he went on to claim:\n\n\nI merely draw out the predicate in accordance with the principle of\ncontradiction, and can thereby at the same time become conscious of\nthe necessity of the judgment. (B11)\n\n\nAs Jerrold Katz (1988) emphasized, this second definition is\nsignificantly different from the \u201ccontainment\u201d idea, since\nnow, in its appeal to the powerful method of proof by contradiction,\nthe analytic would include all of the (potentially infinite) deductive\nconsequences of a particular claim, many of which could not be\nplausibly regarded as \u201ccontained\u201d in the concept expressed\nin the claim. For starters, Bachelors are unmarried or the moon is\nblue is a logical consequence of Bachelors are\nunmarried\u2014its denial contradicts the latter (a denial of a\ndisjunction is a denial of each disjunct)\u2014but clearly nothing\nabout the color of the moon is remotely \u201ccontained in\u201d the\nconcept bachelor. To avoid such consequences, Katz (e.g.,\n1972, 1988) went on to try to develop a serious theory based upon only\nthe initial containment idea, as, along different lines, does Paul\nPietroski (2005, 2018).\n\nOne reason Kant may not have noticed the differences between his\ndifferent characterizations of the analytic was that his conception of\n\u201clogic\u201d seems to have been confined to Aristotelian\nsyllogistic, and so didn\u2019t include the full resources of modern\nlogic, where, as we\u2019ll see, the differences between the two\ncharacterizations become more glaring (see MacFarlane 2002). Indeed,\nKant demarcates the category of the analytic chiefly in order to\ncontrast it with what he regards as the more important category of the\n\u201csynthetic,\u201d which he famously thinks is not confined, as\none might initially suppose, merely to the\n empirical.[2]\n He argues that even so elementary an example in arithmetic as\n7+5=12 is synthetic, since the concept of 12 is not\ncontained in the concepts of 7, 5, or +,:\nappreciating the truth of the proposition would seem to require some\nkind of active \u201csynthesis\u201d by the mind uniting the\ndifferent constituent thoughts (1787 [1998], B15). And so we arrive at\nthe category of the \u201csynthetic a priori,\u201d whose\nvery possibility became a major concern of his work. Kant tried to\nshow that the activity of synthesis was the source of the important\ncases of a priori knowledge, not only in arithmetic, but also\nin geometry, the foundations of physics, ethics, and philosophy\ngenerally, a controversial view that set the stage for much of the\nphilosophical discussions of the subsequent centuries (see Coffa 1991,\npt. I).\n\nApart from geometry, Kant, himself, actually didn\u2019t focus much\non the case of mathematics. But, as mathematics in the 19th C. began\nreaching new heights of sophistication, worries were increasingly\nraised about its foundations. It was specifically in response to these\nlatter worries that Gottlob Frege (1884 [1980]) tried to improve upon\nKant\u2019s formulations of the analytic, and presented what is\nwidely regarded as the next significant discussion of the\n topic.[3]\n",
