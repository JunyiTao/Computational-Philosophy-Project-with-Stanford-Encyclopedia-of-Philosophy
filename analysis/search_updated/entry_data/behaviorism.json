    "main_text": "\n1. What is Behaviorism?\n\nOne has to be careful with \u201cism\u201d words. They often have\nboth loose and strict meanings. And sometimes multiple meanings of\neach type. \u2018Behaviorism\u2019 is no exception. Loosely\nspeaking, behaviorism is an attitude \u2013 a way of conceiving of\nempirical constraints on psychological state attribution. Strictly\nspeaking, behaviorism is a doctrine \u2013 a way of doing\npsychological or behavioral science itself.\n\nWilfred Sellars (1912\u201389), the distinguished philosopher, noted\nthat a person may qualify as a behaviorist, loosely or attitudinally\nspeaking, if they insist on confirming \u201chypotheses about\npsychological events in terms of behavioral criteria\u201d (1963, p.\n22). A behaviorist, so understood, is someone who demands behavioral\nevidence for any psychological hypothesis. For such a person, there is\nno knowable difference between two states of mind (beliefs, desires,\netc.) unless there is a demonstrable difference in the behavior\nassociated with each state. Consider the current belief of a person\nthat it is raining. If there is no difference in his or her behavior\nbetween believing that it is raining and believing that it is not\nraining, there is no grounds for attributing the one belief rather\nthan the other. The attribution is empirically empty or unconstrained.\n\n\nArguably, there is nothing truly exciting about behaviorism loosely\nunderstood. It enthrones behavioral evidence, an arguably inescapable\npremise not just in psychological science but in ordinary discourse\nabout mind and behavior. Just how behavioral evidence should be\n\u2018enthroned\u2019 (especially in science) may be debated. But\nenthronement itself is not in question.\n\nNot so behaviorism the doctrine. It has been widely and vigorously\ndebated. This entry is about the doctrine, not the attitude.\nBehaviorism, the doctrine, has caused considerable excitation among\nboth advocates and critics. In a manner of speaking, it is a doctrine,\nor family of doctrines, about how to enthrone behavior not just in the\nscience of psychology but in the metaphysics of human and animal\nbehavior.\n\nBehaviorism, the doctrine, is committed in its fullest and most\ncomplete sense to the truth of the following three sets of claims.\n\nPsychology is the science of behavior. Psychology is not the\nscience of the inner mind \u2013 as something other or different from\nbehavior.\nBehavior can be described and explained without making ultimate\nreference to mental events or to internal psychological processes. The\nsources of behavior are external (in the environment), not internal\n(in the mind, in the head).\nIn the course of theory development in psychology, if, somehow,\nmental terms or concepts are deployed in describing or explaining\nbehavior, then either (a) these terms or concepts should be eliminated\nand replaced by behavioral terms or (b) they can and should be\ntranslated or paraphrased into behavioral concepts.\n\n\nThe three sets of claims are logically distinct. Moreover, taken\nindependently, each helps to form a type of behaviorism.\n\u201cMethodological\u201d behaviorism is committed to the truth of\n(1). \u201cPsychological\u201d behaviorism is committed to the truth\nof (2). \u201cAnalytical\u201d behaviorism (also known as\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d or \u201clogical\u201d behaviorism) is\ncommitted to the truth of the sub-statement in (3) that mental terms\nor concepts can and should be translated into behavioral concepts.\n\nOther nomenclature is sometimes used to classify behaviorisms. Georges\nRey (1997, p. 96), for example, classifies behaviorisms as\nmethodological, analytical, and radical, where \u201cradical\u201d\nis Rey\u2019s term for what is here classified as psychological\nbehaviorism. The term \u201cradical\u201d is instead reserved for\nthe psychological behaviorism of B. F. Skinner. Skinner employs the\nexpression \u201cradical behaviorism\u201d to describe his brand of\nbehaviorism or his philosophy of behaviorism (see Skinner 1974, p.\n18). In the classification scheme used in this entry, radical\nbehaviorism is a sub-type of psychological behaviorism, primarily,\nalthough it combines all three types of behaviorism (methodological,\nanalytical, and psychological).\n2. Three Types of Behaviorism\n\nMethodological behaviorism is a normative theory about the scientific\nconduct of psychology. It claims that psychology should concern itself\nwith the behavior of organisms (human and nonhuman animals).\nPsychology should not concern itself with mental states or events or\nwith constructing internal information processing accounts of\nbehavior. According to methodological behaviorism, reference to mental\nstates, such as an animal\u2019s beliefs or desires, adds nothing to\nwhat psychology can and should understand about the sources of\nbehavior. Mental states are private entities which, given the\nnecessary publicity of science, do not form proper objects of\nempirical study. Methodological behaviorism is a dominant theme in the\nwritings of John Watson (1878\u20131958).\n\nPsychological behaviorism is a research program within psychology. It\npurports to explain human and animal behavior in terms of external\nphysical stimuli, responses, learning histories, and (for certain\ntypes of behavior) reinforcements. Psychological behaviorism is\npresent in the work of Ivan Pavlov (1849\u20131936), Edward Thorndike\n(1874\u20131949), as well as Watson. Its fullest and most influential\nexpression is B. F. Skinner\u2019s work on schedules of\nreinforcement.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a hungry rat in an experimental chamber. If a\nparticular movement, such as pressing a lever when a light is on, is\nfollowed by the presentation of food, then the likelihood of the\nrat\u2019s pressing the lever when hungry, again, and the light is\non, is increased. Such presentations are reinforcements, such lights\nare (discriminative) stimuli, such lever pressings are responses, and\nsuch trials or associations are learning histories.\n\nAnalytical or logical behaviorism is a theory within philosophy about\nthe meaning or semantics of mental terms or concepts. It says that the\nvery idea of a mental state or condition is the idea of a behavioral\ndisposition or family of behavioral tendencies, evident in how a\nperson behaves in one situation rather than another. When we attribute\na belief, for example, to someone, we are not saying that he or she is\nin a particular internal state or condition. Instead, we are\ncharacterizing the person in terms of what he or she might do in\nparticular situations or environmental interactions. Analytical\nbehaviorism may be found in the work of Gilbert Ryle (1900\u201376)\nand the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u201351) (if perhaps\nnot without controversy in interpretation, in Wittgenstein\u2019s\ncase). More recently, the philosopher-psychologist U. T. Place\n(1924\u20132000) advocated a brand of analytical behaviorism restricted to\nintentional or representational states of mind, such as beliefs, which\nPlace took to constitute a type, although not the only type, of\nmentality (see Graham and Valentine 2004). Arguably, a version of\nanalytical or logical behaviorism may also be found in the work of\nDaniel Dennett on the ascription of states of consciousness via a\nmethod he calls \u2018heterophenomenology\u2019 (Dennett 2005, pp.\n25\u201356). (See also Melser 2004.) \n3. Roots of Behaviorism\n\nEach of methodological, psychological, and analytical behaviorism has\nhistorical foundations. Analytical behaviorism traces its historical\nroots to the philosophical movement known as Logical Positivism (see\nSmith 1986). Logical positivism proposes that the meaning of\nstatements used in science must be understood in terms of experimental\nconditions or observations that verify their truth. This positivist\ndoctrine is known as \u201cverificationism.\u201d In psychology,\nverificationism underpins or grounds analytical behaviorism, namely,\nthe claim that mental concepts refer to behavioral tendencies and so\nmust be translated into behavioral terms.\n\nAnalytical behaviorism helps to avoid a metaphysical position known as\nsubstance dualism. Substance dualism is the doctrine that mental\nstates take place in a special, non-physical mental substance (the\nimmaterial mind). By contrast, for analytical behaviorism, the belief\nthat I have as I arrive on time for a 2pm dental appointment, namely,\nthat I have a 2pm appointment, is not the property of a mental\nsubstance. Believing is a family of tendencies of my body. In\naddition, for an analytical behaviorist, we cannot identify the belief\nabout my arrival independently of that arrival or other members of\nthis family of tendencies. So, we also cannot treat it as the cause of\nthe arrival. Cause and effect are, as Hume taught, conceptually\ndistinct existences. Believing that I have a 2pm appointment is not\ndistinct from my arrival and so cannot be part of the causal\nfoundations of arrival.\n\nPsychological behaviorism\u2019s historical roots consist, in part,\nin the classical associationism of the British Empiricists, foremost\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) and David Hume (1711\u201376). According\nto classical associationism, intelligent behavior is the product of\nassociative learning. As a result of associations or pairings between\nperceptual experiences or stimulations on the one hand, and ideas or\nthoughts on the other, persons and animals acquire knowledge of their\nenvironment and how to act. Associations enable creatures to discover\nthe causal structure of the world. Association is most helpfully\nviewed as the acquisition of knowledge about relations between events.\nIntelligence in behavior is a mark of such knowledge.\n\nClassical associationism relied on introspectible entities, such as\nperceptual experiences or stimulations as the first links in\nassociations, and thoughts or ideas as the second links. Psychological\nbehaviorism, motivated by experimental interests, claims that to\nunderstand the origins of behavior, reference to stimulations\n(experiences) should be replaced by reference to stimuli (physical\nevents in the environment), and that reference to thoughts or ideas\nshould be eliminated or displaced in favor of reference to responses\n(overt behavior, motor movement). Psychological behaviorism is\nassociationism without appeal to inner mental events.\n\nDon\u2019t human beings talk of introspectible entities, thoughts,\nfeelings, and so on, even if these are not recognized by behaviorism\nor best understood as behavioral tendencies? Psychological\nbehaviorists regard the practice of talking about one\u2019s own\nstates of mind, and of introspectively reporting those states, as\npotentially useful data in psychological experiments, but as not\npresupposing the metaphysical subjectivity or non-physical presence of\nthose states. There are different sorts of causes behind introspective\nreports, and psychological behaviorists take these and other elements\nof introspection to be amenable to behavioral analysis. (For\nadditional discussion, see Section 5 of this entry). (See, for\ncomparison, Dennett\u2019s method of heterophenomenology; Dennett\n1991, pp. 72\u201381)\n\nThe task of psychological behaviorism is to specify types of\nassociation, understand how environmental events control behavior,\ndiscover and elucidate causal regularities or laws or functional\nrelations which govern the formation of associations, and predict how\nbehavior will change as the environment changes. The word\n\u201cconditioning\u201d is commonly used to specify the process\ninvolved in acquiring new associations. Animals in so-called\n\u201coperant\u201d conditioning experiments are not learning to,\nfor example, press levers. Instead, they are learning about the\nrelationship between events in their environment, for example, that a\nparticular behavior, pressing the lever in the presences of a light,\ncauses food to appear.\n\nIn its historical foundations, methodological behaviorism shares with\nanalytical behaviorism the influence of positivism. One of the main\ngoals of positivism was to unify psychology with natural science.\nWatson wrote that \u201cpsychology as a behaviorist views it is a\npurely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its\ntheoretical goal is \u2026 prediction and control\u201d (1913, p.\n158). Watson also wrote of the purpose of psychology as follows:\n\u201cTo predict, given the stimulus, what reaction will take place;\nor, given the reaction, state what the situation or stimulus is that\nhas caused the reaction\u201d (1930, p. 11).\n\nThough logically distinct, methodological, psychological, and\nanalytical behaviorisms are sometimes found in one behaviorism.\nSkinner\u2019s radical behaviorism combines all three forms of\nbehaviorism. It follows analytical strictures (at least loosely) in\nparaphrasing mental terms behaviorally, when or if they cannot be\neliminated from explanatory discourse. In Verbal Behavior (1957) and\nelsewhere, Skinner tries to show how mental terms can be given\nbehavioral interpretations. In About Behaviorism (1974) he says that\nwhen mental terminology cannot be eliminated it can be\n\u201ctranslated into behavior\u201d (p. 18, Skinner brackets the\nexpression with his own double quotes).\n\nRadical behaviorism is concerned with the behavior of organisms, not\nwith internal processing (if treated or described differently from\novert behavior). So, it is a form of methodological behaviorism.\nFinally, radical behaviorism understands behavior as a reflection of\nfrequency effects among stimuli, which means that it is a form of\npsychological behaviorism.\n4. Popularity of Behaviorism\n\nBehaviorism of one sort or another was an immensely popular research\nprogram or methodological commitment among students of behavior from\nabout the third decade of the twentieth century through its middle\ndecades, at least until the beginnings of the cognitive science\nrevolution. Cognitive science began to mature roughly from 1960 until\n1985 (see Bechtel, Abrahamsen, and Graham 1998, pp. 15\u201317). In\naddition to Ryle and Wittgenstein, philosophers with sympathies for\nbehaviorism included Carnap (1932\u201333), Hempel (1949), and Quine\n(1960). Quine, for example, took a behaviorist approach to the study\nof language. Quine claimed that the notion of psychological or mental\nactivity has no place in a scientific account of either the origins or\nthe meaning of speech. To talk in a scientifically disciplined manner\nabout the meaning of an utterance is to talk about stimuli for the\nutterance, its so-called \u201cstimulus meaning\u201d. Hempel (1949)\nclaimed that \u201call psychological statements that are meaningful\n\u2026 are translatable into statements that do not involve\npsychological concepts,\u201d but only concepts for physical behavior\n(p. 18).\n\nAmong psychologists behaviorism was even more popular than among\nphilosophers. In addition to Pavlov, Skinner, Thorndike, and Watson,\nthe list of behaviorists among psychologists included, among others,\nE. C. Tolman (1886\u20131959), C. L. Hull (1884\u201352), and E. R.\nGuthrie (1886\u20131959). Tolman, for example, wrote that\n\u201ceverything important in psychology \u2026 can be investigated\nin essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis\nof the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze\u201d\n(1938, p. 34).\n\nBehaviorists created journals, organized societies, and founded\npsychology graduate programs reflective of behaviorism. Behaviorists\norganized themselves into different types of research clusters, whose\ndifferences stemmed from such factors as varying approaches to\nconditioning and experimentation. Some clusters were named as follows:\n\u201cthe experimental analysis of behavior\u201d, \u201cbehavior\nanalysis\u201d, \u201cfunctional analysis\u201d, and, of course,\n\u201cradical behaviorism\u201d. These labels sometimes were\nresponsible for the titles of behaviorism\u2019s leading societies\nand journals, including the Society for the Advancement of Behavior\nAnalysis (SABA), and the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of\nBehavior (begun in 1958) as well as the Journal of Applied Behavior\nAnalysis (begun in 1968).\n\nBehaviorism generated a type of therapy, known as behavior therapy\n(see Rimm and Masters 1974; Erwin 1978). It developed behavior\nmanagement techniques for autistic children (see Lovaas and Newsom\n1976) and token economies for the management of chronic schizophrenics\n(see Stahl and Leitenberg 1976). It fueled discussions of how best to\nunderstand the behavior of nonhuman animals and of the relevance of\nlaboratory study to the natural environmental occurrence of animal\nbehavior (see Schwartz and Lacey 1982).\n\nBehaviorism stumbled upon various critical difficulties with some of\nits commitments. One difficulty is confusion about the effects of\nreinforcement on behavior (see Gallistel 1990). In its original sense,\na stimulus such as food is a reinforcer only if its presentation\nincreases the frequency of a response in a type of associative\nconditioning known as operant conditioning. A problem with this\ndefinition is that it defines reinforcers as stimuli that change\nbehavior. The presentation of food, however, may have no observable\neffect on response frequency with respect to food even in cases in\nwhich an animal is food deprived or hungry. Rather, response frequency\ncan be associated with an animal\u2019s ability to identify and\nremember temporal or spatial properties of the circumstances in which\na stimulus (say, food) is presented. This and other difficulties\nprompted changes in behaviorism\u2019s commitments and new directions\nof research. One alternative direction has been the study of the role\nof short term memory in contributing to reinforcement effects on the\nso-called trajectory of behavior (see Killeen 1994).\n\nAnother stumbling block, in the case of analytical behaviorism, is the\nfact that the behavioral sentences that are intended to offer the\nbehavioral paraphrases of mental terms almost always use mental terms\nthemselves (see Chisholm 1957). In the example of my belief that I\nhave a 2pm dental appointment, one must also speak of my desire to\narrive at 2pm, otherwise the behavior of arriving at 2pm could not\ncount as believing that I have a 2pm appointment. The term\n\u201cdesire\u201d is a mental term. Critics of analytical\nbehaviorism have charged that we can never escape from using mental\nterms in the characterization of the meaning of mental terms. This\nsuggests that mental discourse cannot be displaced by behavioral\ndiscourse. At least it cannot be displaced term-by-term. Perhaps\nanalytical behaviorists need to paraphrase a whole swarm of mental\nterms at once so as to recognize the presumption that the attribution\nof any one such mental term presupposes the application of others (see\nRey 1997, p. 154\u20135).\n5. Why be a Behaviorist\n\nWhy would anyone be a behaviorist? There are three main reasons (see\nalso Zuriff 1985).\n\nThe first reason is epistemic or evidential. Warrant or evidence for\nsaying, at least in the third person case, that an animal or person is\nin a certain mental state, for example, possesses a certain belief, is\ngrounded in behavior, understood as observable behavior. Moreover, the\nconceptual space or step between the claim that behavior warrants the\nattribution of belief and the claim that believing consists in\nbehavior itself is a short and in some ways appealing step. If we\nlook, for example, at how people are taught to use mental concepts and\nterms\u2014terms like \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cdesire\u201d,\nand so on\u2014conditions of use appear inseparably connected with\nbehavioral tendencies in certain circumstances. If mental state\nattribution bears a special connection with behavior, it is tempting\nto say that mentality just consists in behavioral tendencies.\n\nThe second reason can be expressed as follows: One major difference\nbetween mentalistic (mental states in-the-head) and associationist or\nconditioning accounts of behavior is that mentalistic accounts tend to\nhave a strong nativist bent. This is true even though there may be\nnothing inherently nativist about mentalistic accounts (see Cowie\n1998).\n\nMentalistic accounts tend to assume, and sometimes even explicitly to\nembrace (see Fodor 1981), the hypothesis that the mind possesses at\nbirth or innately a set of procedures or internally represented\nprocessing rules which are deployed when learning or acquiring new\nresponses. Behaviorism, by contrast, is anti-nativist. Behaviorism,\ntherefore, appeals to theorists who deny that there are innate rules\nby which organisms learn. To Skinner and Watson organisms learn\nwithout being innately or pre-experientially provided with implicit\nprocedures by which to learn. Learning does not consist, at least\ninitially, in rule-governed behavior. Learning is what organisms do in\nresponse to stimuli. For a behaviorist an organism learns, as it were,\nfrom its successes and mistakes. \u201cRules,\u201d says Skinner\n(1984a), \u201care derived from contingencies, which specify\ndiscriminative stimuli, responses, and consequences\u201d (p. 583).\n(See also Dennett 1978).\n\nMuch contemporary work in cognitive science on the set of models known\nas connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) models seems\nto share behaviorism\u2019s anti-nativism about learning. PDP model\nbuilding takes an approach to learning which is response oriented\nrather than rule-governed and this is because, like behaviorism, it\nhas roots in associationism (see Bechtel 1985; compare Graham 1991\nwith Maloney 1991). Whether PDP models ultimately are or must be\nanti-nativist depends upon what counts as native or innate rules\n(Bechtel and Abrahamsen 1991, pp. 103\u2013105). \n\nThe third reason for behaviorism\u2019s appeal, popular at least\nhistorically, is related to its disdain for reference to inner mental\nor mentalistic information processing as explanatory causes of\nbehavior. The disdain is most vigorously exemplified in the work of\nSkinner. Skinner\u2019s skepticism about explanatory references to\nmental innerness may be described as follows.\n\nSuppose we try to explain the public behavior of a person by\ndescribing how they represent,conceptualize or think about their\nsituation. Suppose they conceive or think of their situation in a\ncertain way, not as bare, as filled with items without attributes, but\nas things, as trees, as people, as walruses, walls, and wallets.\nSuppose, we also say, a person never merely interacts with their\nenvironment; but rather interacts with their environment as they\nperceive, see, or represent it. So, for example, thinking of something\nas a wallet, a person reaches for it. Perceiving something as a\nwalrus, they back away from it. Classifying something as a wall, they\ndon\u2019t bump into it. So understood, behavior is endogenously\nproduced movement, viz. behavior that has its causal origin within the\nperson who thinks of or represents their situation in a certain\nway.\n\nSkinner would object to such claims. He would object not because he\nbelieves that the eye is innocent or that inner or endogenous activity\ndoes not occur. He would object because he believes that behavior must\nbe explained in terms that do not themselves presuppose the very thing\nthat is explained. The outside (public) behavior of a person is not\naccounted for by referring to the inside (inner processing, cognitive\nactivity) behavior of the person (say, his or her classifying or\nanalyzing their environment) if, therein, the behavior of the person\nultimately is unexplained. \u201cThe objection,\u201d wrote Skinner,\n\u201cto inner states is not that they do not exist, but that they\nare not relevant in a functional analysis\u201d (Skinner 1953, p.\n35). \u2018Not relevant\u2019 means, for Skinner, explanatorily\ncircular or regressive.\n\nSkinner charges that since mental activity is a form of behavior\n(albeit inner), the only non-regressive, non-circular way to explain\nbehavior is to appeal to something non-behavioral. This non-behavioral\nsomething is environmental stimuli and an organism\u2019s\ninteractions with, and reinforcement from, the environment.\n\nSo, the third reason for behaviorism\u2019s appeal is that it tries\nto avoid (what it claims is) circular, regressive explanations of\nbehavior. It aims to refrain from accounting for one type of behavior\n(overt) in terms of another type of behavior (covert), all the while,\nin some sense, leaving behavior unexplained.\n\nIt should be noted that Skinner\u2019s views about explanation and\nthe purported circularity of explanation by reference to inner\nprocessing are both extreme and scientifically contestable, and that\nmany who have self-identified as behaviorists including Guthrie,\nTolman, and Hull, or continue to work within the tradition, broadly\nunderstood, including Killeen (1987) and Rescorla (1990), take\nexception to much that Skinner has said about explanatory references\nto innerness. Also Skinner himself is not always clear about his\naversion to innerness. Skinner\u2019s derisive attitude towards\nexplanatory references to mental innerness stems, in part, not just\nfrom fears of explanatory circularity but from his conviction that if\nthe language of psychology is permitted to refer to internal\nprocessing, this goes some way towards permitting talk of immaterial\nmental substances, agents endowed with contra-causal free will, and\nlittle persons (homunculi) within bodies. Each of these Skinner takes\nto be incompatible with a scientific worldview (see Skinner 1971; see\nalso Day 1976). Finally, it must be noted that Skinner\u2019s\naversion to explanatory references to innerness is not an aversion to\ninner mental states or processes per se. He readily admits that\nprivate thoughts and so on exist. Skinner countenances talk of inner\nevents but only provided that their innerness is treated in the same\nmanner as public behavior or overt responses. An adequate science of\nbehavior, he claims, must describe events taking place within the skin\nof the organism as part of behavior itself (see Skinner 1976).\n\u201cSo far as I am concerned,\u201d he wrote in 1984 in a special\nissue of Behavioral and Brain Sciences devoted to his work,\n\u201cwhatever happens when we inspect a public stimulus is in every\nrespect similar to what happens when we introspect a private\none\u201d (Skinner 1984b, p. 575; compare Graham 1984, pp.\n558\u20139).\n\nSkinner does not have much to say about just how inner (covert,\nprivate) behavior (like thinking, classifying, and analyzing) can be\ndescribed in the same manner as public or overt behavior. But his idea\nis roughly as follows. Just as we may describe overt behavior or motor\nmovement in terms of concepts like stimulus, response, conditioning,\nreinforcement, and so on, so we may deploy the very same terms in\ndescribing inner or covert behavior. One thought or line of thought\nmay reinforce another thought. An act of analysis may serve as a\nstimulus for an effort at classification. And so on. Purely\n\u2018mentalistic\u2019 activities may be at least roughly parsed in\nterms of behavioral concepts \u2014 a topic to be revisited later in\nthe entry (in the 7th Section). \n6. Skinner\u2019s Social Worldview\n\nSkinner is the only major figure in the history of behaviorism to\noffer a socio-political world view based on his commitment to\nbehaviorism. Skinner constructed a theory as well as narrative picture\nin Walden Two (1948) of what an ideal human society would be like if\ndesigned according to behaviorist principles (see also Skinner 1971).\nSkinner\u2019s social worldview illustrates his aversions to free\nwill, to homunculi, and to dualism as well as his positive reasons for\nclaiming that a person\u2019s history of environmental interactions\ncontrols his or her behavior.\n\nOne possible feature of human behavior which Skinner deliberately\nrejects is that people freely or creatively make their own\nenvironments (see Chomsky 1971, Black 1973). Skinner protests that\n\u201cit is in the nature of an experimental analysis of human\nbehavior that it should strip away the functions previously assigned\nto a free or autonomous person and transfer them one by one to the\ncontrolling environment\u201d (1971, p. 198).\n\nCritics have raised several objections to the Skinnerian social\npicture. One of the most persuasive, and certainly one of the most\nfrequent, adverts to Skinner\u2019s vision of the ideal human\nsociety. It is a question asked of the fictional founder of Walden\nTwo, Frazier, by the philosopher Castle. It is the question of what is\nthe best social or communal mode of existence for a human being.\nFrazier\u2019s, and therein Skinner\u2019s, response to this\nquestion is both too general and incomplete. Frazier/Skinner praises\nthe values of health, friendship, relaxation, rest, and so forth.\nHowever, these values are hardly the detailed basis of a social\nsystem.\n\nThere is a notorious difficulty in social theory of specifying the\nappropriate level of detail at which a blueprint for a new and ideal\nsociety must be presented (see Arnold 1990, pp. 4\u201310). Skinner\nidentifies the behavioristic principles and learning incentives that\nhe hopes will reduce systematic injustices in social systems. He also\ndescribes a few practices (concerning child rearing and the like) that\nare intended to contribute to human happiness. However, he offers only\nthe haziest descriptions of the daily lives of Walden Two citizens and\nno suggestions for how best to resolve disputes about alternative ways\nof life that are prima facie consistent with behaviorist principles\n(see Kane 1996, p. 203). He gives little or no serious attention to\nthe crucial general problem of inter-personal conflict resolution and\nto the role of institutional arrangements in resolving conflicts.\n\nIn an essay which appeared in The Behavior Analyst (1985), nearly\nforty years after the publication of Walden Two, Skinner, in the guise\nof Frazier, tried to clarify his characterization of ideal human\ncircumstances. He wrote that in the ideal human society \u201cpeople\njust naturally do the things they need to do to maintain themselves\n\u2026 and treat each other well, and they just naturally do a\nhundred other things they enjoy doing because they do not have to do\nthem\u201d (p. 9). However, of course, doing a hundred things humans\nenjoy doing means only that Walden Two is vaguely defined, not that\nits culturally instituted habits and the character of its institutions\nmerit emulation.\n\nThe incompleteness of Skinner\u2019s description of the ideal human\nsociety or life is so widely acknowledged that one might wonder if\nactual experiments in Walden Two living could lend useful detail to\nhis blueprint. More than one such social experiment has been\nconducted. Perhaps the most interesting (in part because the community\nhas evolved away from its Skinnerian roots) is the Twin Oaks Community\nin Virginia in the U.S.A., which can be indirectly explored via the\nInternet (see Other Internet Resources).\n7. Why be Anti-Behaviorist\n\nBehaviorism is dismissed by cognitive scientists developing intricate\ninternal information processing models of cognition. Its laboratory\nroutines or experimental regimens are neglected by cognitive\nethologists and ecological psychologists convinced that its methods\nare irrelevant to studying how animals and persons behave in their\nnatural and social environment. Its traditional relative indifference\ntowards neuroscience and deference to environmental contingencies is\nrejected by neuroscientists sure that direct study of the brain is the\nonly way to understand the truly proximate causes of behavior.\n\nBut by no means has behaviorism disappeared. Robust elements of\nbehaviorism survive in both behavior therapy and laboratory-based\nanimal learning theory (of which more below). In the metaphysics of\nmind, too, behavioristic themes survive in the approach to mind known\nas Functionalism. Functionalism defines states of mind as states that\nplay causal-functional roles in animals or systems in which they\noccur. Paul Churchland writes of Functionalism as follows: \u201cThe\nessential or defining feature of any type of mental states is the set\nof causal relations it bears to \u2026 bodily behavior\u201d (1984,\np. 36). This functionalist notion is similar to the behaviorist idea\nthat reference to behavior and to stimulus/response relations enters\ncentrally and essentially into any account of what it means for a\ncreature to behave or to be subject, in the scheme of analytical or\nlogical behaviorism, to the attribution of mental states. \n\nFans of the so-called and now widely discussed Extended Mind\nHypothesis (EMH) also share a kinship with behaviorism or at least\nwith Skinner. The defining hypothesis of EMH is that\n\u201cmental\u201d representation is a matter that spills out from\nthe brain or head into the world and cultural environment (Levy 2007).\nRepresentations are things external to the head or which bear special\nindividuating relationships with external devices or forms of cultural\nactivity. Skinner\u2019s misgivings about depicting the power of\nmental representation as something confined to the head (brain, inner\nmind) are at least loosely akin to EMH\u2019s shift to depict\nrepresentationality as environmentally extended.\n\nElements, however, are elements. Behaviorism is no longer a dominating\nresearch program. \n\nWhy has the influence of behaviorism declined? The deepest and most\ncomplex reason for behaviorism\u2019s decline in influence is its\ncommitment to the thesis that behavior can be explained without\nreference to non-behavioral and inner mental (cognitive,\nrepresentational, or interpretative) activity. Behavior, for Skinner,\ncan be explained just by reference to its \u201cfunctional\u201d\n(Skinner\u2019s term) relation to or co-variation with the\nenvironment and to the animal\u2019s history of environmental\ninteraction. Neurophysiological and neurobiological conditions, for\nSkinner, sustain or implement these functional or causal relations.\nBut they do not serve as ultimate or independent sources or\nexplanations of behavior. Behavior, Skinner (1953) wrote, cannot be\naccounted for \u201cwhile staying wholly inside [an animal];\neventually we must turn to forces operating upon the organism from\nwithout.\u201d \u201cUnless there is a weak spot in our causal chain\nso that the second [neurological] link is not lawfully determined by\nthe first [environmental stimuli], or the third [behavior] by the\nsecond, the first and third links must be lawfully related.\u201d (p.\n35) \u201cValid information about the second link may throw light on\nthis relationship but can in no way alter it.\u201d (ibid.) It is\n\u201cexternal variables of which behavior is a function.\u201d\n(ibid.) \n\nSkinner was no triumphalist about neuroscience. Neuroscience, for him,\nmore or less just identifies organismic physical processes that\nunderlie animal/environment interactions. Therein, it rides evidential\nor epistemic piggyback on radical behaviorism\u2019s prior\ndescription of those interactions. \u201cThe organism\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cis not empty, and it cannot adequately be treated simply\nas a black box\u201d (1976, p. 233). \u201cSomething is done today\nwhich affects the behavior of the organism tomorrow\u201d (p. 233).\nNeuroscience describes inside-the-box mechanisms that permit\ntoday\u2019s reinforcing stimulus to affect tomorrow\u2019s\nbehavior. The neural box is not empty, but it is unable, except in\ncases of malfunction or breakdown, to disengage the animal from past\npatterns of behavior that have been reinforced. It cannot exercise\nindependent or non-environmentally countervailing authority over\nbehavior.\n\nFor many critics of behaviorism it seems obvious that, at a minimum,\nthe occurrence and character of behavior (especially human behavior)\ndoes not depend primarily upon an individual\u2019s reinforcement\nhistory, although that is a factor, but on the fact that the\nenvironment or learning history is represented by an individual and\nhow (the manner in which) it is represented. The fact that the\nenvironment is represented by me constrains or informs the functional\nor causal relations that hold between my behavior and the environment\nand may, from an anti-behaviorist perspective, partially disengage my\nbehavior from its conditioning or reinforcement history. No matter,\nfor example, how tirelessly and repeatedly I have been reinforced for\npointing to or eating ice cream, such a history is impotent if I just\ndon\u2019t see a potential stimulus as ice cream or represent it to\nmyself as ice cream or if I desire to hide the fact that something is\nice cream from others. My conditioning history, narrowly understood as\nunrepresented by me, is behaviorally less important than the\nenvironment or my learning history as represented or interpreted by\nme.\n\nSimilarly, for many critics of behaviorism, if representationality\ncomes between environment and behavior, this implies that Skinner is\ntoo restrictive or limited in his attitude towards the role of brain\nmechanisms in producing or controlling behavior. The brain is no mere\npassive memory bank of behavior/environment interactions (see Roediger\nand Goff 1998). The central nervous system, which otherwise sustains\nmy reinforcement history, contains systems or neurocomputational\nsub-systems that implement or encode whatever representational content\nor meaning the environment has for me. It is also an active\ninterpretation machine or semantic engine, often critically performing\nenvironmentally untethered and behavior controlling tasks. Such talk\nof representation or interpretation, however, is a perspective from\nwhich behaviorism\u2014most certainly in Skinner\u2014 wishes and\ntries to depart.\n\nOne defining aspiration of traditional behaviorism is that it tried to\nfree psychology from having to theorize about how animals and persons\nrepresent (internally, in the head) their environment. This effort at\nfreedom was important, historically, because it seemed that\nbehavior/environment connections are a lot clearer and more manageable\nexperimentally than internal representations. Unfortunately, for\nbehaviorism, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more restrictive rule for\npsychology than one which prohibits hypotheses about representational\nstorage and processing. Stephen Stich, for example, complains against\nSkinner that \u201cwe now have an enormous collection of experimental\ndata which, it would seem, simply cannot be made sense of unless we\npostulate something like\u201d information processing mechanisms in\nthe heads of organisms (1998, p. 649).\n\nA second reason for rejecting behaviorism is that some features of\nmentality\u2014some elements, in particular, of the conscious mental\nlife of persons\u2014have characteristic \u2018qualia\u2019 or\npresentationally immediate or phenomenal qualities. To be in pain, for\nexample, is not merely to produce appropriate pain behavior under the\nright environmental circumstances, but it is to experience a\n\u2018like-thisness\u2019 to the pain (as something dull or sharp,\nperhaps). A purely behaviorist creature, a \u2018zombie\u2019, as it\nwere, may engage in pain behavior, including beneath the skin pain\nresponses, yet completely lack whatever is qualitatively distinctive\nof and proper to pain (its painfulness). (See also Graham 1998, pp.\n47\u201351 and Graham and Horgan 2000. On the scope of the phenomenal\nin human mentality, see Graham, Horgan, and Tienson 2009).\n\nThe philosopher-psychologist U. T. Place, although otherwise\nsympathetic to the application of behaviorist ideas to matters of\nmind, argued that phenomenal qualia cannot be analyzed in behaviorist\nterms. He claimed that qualia are neither behavior nor dispositions to\nbehave. \u201cThey make themselves felt,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom\nthe very moment that the experience of whose qualia they are\u201d\ncomes into existence (2000, p. 191; reprinted in Graham and Valentine\n2004). They are instantaneous features of processes or events rather\nthan dispositions manifested over time. Qualitative mental events\n(such as sensations, perceptual experiences, and so on), for Place,\nundergird dispositions to behave rather than count as dispositions.\nIndeed, it is tempting to postulate that the qualitative aspects of\nmentality affect non-qualitative elements of internal processing, and\nthat they, for example, contribute to arousal, attention, and\nreceptivity to associative conditioning.\n\nThe third reason for rejecting behaviorism is connected with Noam\nChomsky. Chomsky has been one of behaviorism\u2019s most successful\nand damaging critics. In a review of Skinner\u2019s book on verbal\nbehavior (see above), Chomsky (1959) charged that behaviorist models\nof language learning cannot explain various facts about language\nacquisition, such as the rapid acquisition of language by young\nchildren, which is sometimes referred to as the phenomenon of\n\u201clexical explosion.\u201d A child\u2019s linguistic abilities\nappear to be radically underdetermined by the evidence of verbal\nbehavior offered to the child in the short period in which he or she\nexpresses those abilities. By the age of four or five (normal)\nchildren have an almost limitless capacity to understand and produce\nsentences which they have never heard before. Chomsky also argued that\nit seems plainly untrue that language learning depends on the\napplication of detailed reinforcement. A child does not, as an English\nspeaker in the presence of a house, utter \u201chouse\u201d\nrepeatedly in the presence of reinforcing elders. Language as such\nseems to be learned without, in a sense, being explicitly taught or\ntaught in detail, and behaviorism doesn\u2019t offer an account of\nhow this could be so. Chomsky\u2019s own speculations about the\npsychological realities underlying language development include the\nhypothesis that the rules or principles underlying linguistic behavior\nare abstract (applying to all human languages) and innate (part of our\nnative psychological endowment as human beings). When put to the test\nof uttering a grammatical sentence, a person, for Chomsky, has a\nvirtually infinite number of possible responses available, and the\nonly way in which to understand this virtually infinite generative\ncapacity is to suppose that a person possesses a powerful and abstract\ninnate grammar (underlying whatever competence he or she may have in\none or more particular natural languages).\n\nThe problem to which Chomsky refers, which is the problem of\nbehavioral competence and thus performance outstripping individual\nlearning histories, goes beyond merely the issue of linguistic\nbehavior in young children. It appears to be a fundamental fact about\nhuman beings that our behavior and behavioral capacities often surpass\nthe limitations of individual reinforcement histories. Our history of\nreinforcement is often too impoverished to determine uniquely what we\ndo or how we do it. Much learning, therefore, seems to require\npre-existing or innate representational structures or principled\nconstraints within which learning occurs. (See also Brewer 1974, but\ncompare with Bates et al. 1998 and Cowie 1998).\n\nIs the case against behaviorism definitive? Decisive? Paul Meehl noted\ndecades ago that theories in psychology seem to disappear not under\nthe force of decisive refutation but rather because researchers lose\ninterest in their theoretical orientations (Meehl 1978). One\nimplication of Meehl\u2019s thesis is that a once popular\n\u201cIsm\u201d, not having been decisively refuted, may restore\nsome of its former prominence if it mutates or transforms itself so as\nto incorporate responses to criticisms. What may this mean for\nbehaviorism? It may mean that some version of the doctrine might\nrebound.\n\nSkinner claimed that neural activities subserve or underlie\nbehavior/environment relations and that the organism\u2019s\ncontribution to these relations does not reduce to neurophysiological\nproperties. But this does not mean that behaviorism cannot gain useful\nalliance with neuroscience. Reference to brain structures\n(neurobiology, neurochemistry, and so on) may help in explaining\nbehavior even if such references do not ultimately displace reference\nto environmental contingencies in a behaviorist account.\n\nSuch is a lesson of animal modeling in which behaviorist themes still\nenjoy currency. Animal models of addiction, habit and instrumental\nlearning are particularly noteworthy because they bring behavioral\nresearch into closer contact than did traditional psychological\nbehaviorism with research on the brain mechanisms underlying\nreinforcement, especially positive reinforcement (West 2006, pp.\n91\u2013108). One result of this contact is the discovery that\nsensitized neural systems responsible for heightened reinforcement\nvalue or strength can be dissociated from the hedonic utility or\npleasurable quality of reinforcement (see Robinson and Berridge 2003).\nThe power of a stimulus to reinforce behavior may be independent of\nwhether it is a source or cause of pleasure. Focus on brain mechanisms\nunderlying reinforcement also forms the centerpiece of one of the most\nactive research programs in current neuroscience, so-called\nneuroeconomics, which weds study of the brain\u2019s reward systems\nwith models of valuation and economic decision making (see Montague\nand Berns 2002; Nestler and Malenka 2004; Ross et al 2008).\nBehaviorism may do well to purchase some of neuroeconomic\u2019s\nconceptual currency, especially since some advocates of the program\nsee themselves as behaviorists in spirit if not stereotypical letter\nand honor the work of a number of theorists in the behavioristic\ntradition of the experimental analysis of behavior, such as George\nAinslie, Richard Herrnstein and Howard Rachlin, on how patterns of\nbehavior relate to patterns of reward or reinforcement (see Ross et\nal. 2008, especially p. 10). One important assumption in\nneuroeconomics is that full explanations of organism/environmental\ninteractions will combine facts about such things as reinforcement\nschedules with appeal to neurocomputational modeling and to the\nneurochemistry and neurobiology of reinforcement. \n\nOther potential sources of utility or renewal? The continued\npopularity of so-called economic behavior therapy is noteworthy\nbecause it offers a potential domain of testing application for the\nregimen of behaviorism. Early versions of behavior therapy sought to\napply restricted results from Skinnerian or Pavlovian conditioning\nparadigms to human behavior problems. No minds should be spoken of;\njust behavior\u2014stimuli, responses, and reinforcement. Therapy\nshapes behavior not thought. Successive generations of behavior\ntherapy relax those conceptual restrictions. Advocates refer to\nthemselves as cognitive behavior therapists (e.g. Mahoney 1974;\nMeichenbaum 1977). Clients\u2019 behavior problems are described by\nreferring to their beliefs, desires, intentions, memories, and so on.\nEven the language of self-reflexive thought and belief (so-called\n\u2018meta-cognition\u2019) figures in some accounts of behavioral\ndifficulties and interventions (Wells 2000). One goal of such language\nis to encourage clients to monitor and self-reinforce their own\nbehavior. Self-reinforcement is an essential feature of behavioral\nself-control (Rachlin 2000; Ainslie 2001). The monitoring process\nmay include a number of checking and error detection processes and\ncorrection of behavior in a client\u2019s current life circumstances\n(West 2006).\n\nIt may be wondered whether cognitive behavior therapy is aptly\nconsistent with behaviorist doctrine. Much depends on how beliefs and\ndesires are understood. If beliefs and desires are understood as\nstates that somehow spill out into the environment and are\nindividuated in terms of their non-mentalistic, behavior-like role in\norganism/environment interactions, this would be consistent with\ntraditional behaviorist doctrine. It would reflect the principle of\nlogical or analytical behaviorism that if mental terms are to be used\nin the description and explanation of behavior, they must be defined\nor paraphrased in non-mental behavioral terms. Prospects for\nbelief/desire individuation in non-mental, environmentally externalist\nterms may look doubtful however, especially in cases of conscious\nattitudes(see Horgan, Tienson and Graham 2006). But the topic of the\nforms and limits of behavior therapy and the range of its plausible\napplication is open for continued further exploration. \n8. Conclusion\n\nIn 1977 Willard Day, a behavioral psychologist and founding editor of\nthe journal Behaviorism (later known as Behavior and Philosophy),\npublished Skinner\u2019s \u201cWhy I am not a cognitive\npsychologist\u201d (Skinner 1977). Skinner began the paper by stating\nthat \u201cthe variables of which human behavior is a function lie in\nthe environment\u201d (p. 1). Skinner ended by remarking that\n\u201ccognitive constructs give \u2026 a misleading account of\nwhat\u201d is inside a human being (p. 10)\n\nMore than a decade earlier, in 1966 Carl Hempel had announced his\ndefection from behaviorism:\n\nIn order to characterize \u2026 behavioral patterns, propensities,\nor capacities \u2026 we need not only a suitable behavioristic\nvocabulary, but psychological terms as well. (p. 110)\n\n\nHempel had come to believe that it is a mistake to imagine that human\nbehavior can be understood exclusively in non-mental, behavioristic\nterms.\n\nContemporary psychology and philosophy largely share Hempel\u2019s\nconviction that the explanation of behavior cannot omit invoking a\ncreature\u2019s representation of its world. Psychology must use\npsychological terms. Behavior without cognition is blind.\nPsychological theorizing without reference to internal cognitive\nprocessing is explanatorily impaired. To say this, of course, is not\nto a priori preclude that behaviorism will recover some of its\nprominence. Just how to conceive of cognitive processing (even where\nto locate it) remains a heated subject of debate (see Melser 2004; see\nalso Levy 2007, pp. 29\u201364). But if behaviorism is to recover\nsome of its prominence, this recovery may require a reformulation of\nits doctrines that is attune to developments (like that of\nneuroeconomics) in neuroscience as well as in novel therapeutic\norientations.\n\nSkinner\u2019s vantage point on or special contribution to\nbehaviorism mates the science of behavior with the language of\norganism/environment interactions. But we humans don\u2019t just run\nand mate and walk and eat in this or that environment. We think,\nclassify, analyze, imagine, and theorize. In addition to our outer\nbehavior, we have highly complex inner lives, wherein we are active,\noften imaginatively, in our heads, all the while often remaining as\nstuck as posts, as still as stones. Call our inner life\n\u2018behavior\u2019 if one wants, but this piece of linguistic\nstipulation does not mean that the probability or occurrence of inner\nevents is shaped by the same environmental contingencies as overt\nbehavior or bodily movements. It does not mean that understanding a\nsentence or composing an entry for this encyclopedia consist of the\nsame general modes of discriminatory responses as learning how to move\none\u2019s body in pursuit of a food source. How the Inner\nRepresentational World of mind maps into the Country of Behaviorism\nremains the \u201cism\u2019s\u201d still incompletely charted\nterritory. \n",
