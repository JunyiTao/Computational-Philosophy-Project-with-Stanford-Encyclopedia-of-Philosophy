    "main_text": "Epistemology and philosophy of language || Aboutness: the theory of apoha\n2.2 Aboutness: the theory of apoha\n\nAt the heart of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s and Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophies is\nthe principle that particulars, i.e., what is real, are only properly\ngrasped by perception; the way they are in themselves is thus said to\nbe \u201cineffable\u201d (avyapade\u015bya; Tib. bstan\nbya min), \u201cnot an object of words\u201d\n (\u015babdasy\u0101vi\u1e63aya).[34]\n Now, obviously, we do in some way manage to talk about\nparticulars\u2014otherwise language would be useless in daily life.\nBut why then say that language and thought fail to capture them?\nThe answer is twofold. First of all, grammatical elements, like\nsubject and predicate, qualifier and qualificand, agent and action,\netc., have no corresponding ontological features, as particulars are\nunities admitting no distinctions between possessors of properties\n(dharmin) and properties (dharma). Dharmak\u012brti\nputs the point as follows in Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\nI.61:\n\n\nIn all cases words expressing substances and their properties just\nmake this [conceptual] distinction. Thus there is no difference\nwhatsoever in the [object] to which they\n refer.[35]\n\n\nSecondly, and perhaps more decisively, the kinds or universals that we\nthink and talk about are not features of the particulars themselves\nbut are merely fictions. Of course, the fact that we do use terms like\n\u201ccow\u201d non-arbitrarily may easily lead us to think that the\nterm must have corresponding real \u201cgrounds for its\napplication\u201d (prav\u1e5bttinimitta),\nand that cow particulars themselves are grouped in a natural\nkind due to their common essential properties. But the\nclear upshot of the Buddhist\u2019s nominalist position about universals is\nthat there are no such natural kinds, and that the usage of terms is\nnot explicable by matching up terms with them.\n\nIneffability thus unpacks as a thorough mismatch between\nrepresentations due to thought and language on the one hand and what\nthere is on the other. For Buddhist Epistemologists this mismatch\nmeans that they cannot adopt unnuanced the predominant Brahmanical\napproach of vy\u0101kara\u1e47a, a grammatically oriented\nmetaphysics in which genuine ontological features would be revealed by\nthe features of Sanskrit grammar (such as case and gender accord\nbetween adjectives and nouns, connections between substantives via the\ngenitive case, etc. Much of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s philosophy of language is\nindeed an attempt to account for such Sanskrit grammatical phenomena,\nbut without the realist baggage.) However, it also leads to a larger\nmatter. The problem is that if the real world is composed only of\nparticulars that are ineffable, it becomes difficult to see how\nlanguage could nonetheless somehow refer to real things or ever be\nabout entities in the world. The Buddhist Epistemologists\nare, in effect, to borrow an idea of Donald Davidson (1984),\nsubscribers to a rigid separation between a conceptual scheme\nand a perceptual content free from the scheme\u2019s additions and\ndistortions, and their problem then becomes how to bridge that very\nscheme-content gap so that thought and language are still somehow\nabout reality. To solve this problem of \u201caboutness\u201d\nDign\u0101ga had devised the theory of concepts, i.e., apoha\n(\u201cexclusions\u201d). Dharmak\u012brti reinterpreted this\ntheory, once again, in terms of causal relations. Here are the broad\n outlines.[36]\n2.2.1 Dign\u0101ga\u2019s apoha\n\nLet us speak about two Buddhist approaches to bridge the\nscheme-content gap, \u201ctop-down\u201d, or descriptive, approaches\nand \u201cbottom-up\u201d, or causal, approaches. By\n\u201ctop-down\u201d we shall mean an account which maintains that\nit is because of some specific (and perhaps ingenious) features of the\nfictional proxy, or concept, that it pertains to particular things.\nEven though it does not have the ontological baggage of a real\nuniversal, the fictional proxy determines the reference of the words\nbecause the descriptive content it provides does in some way have its\ncounterpart in the objects. Thus on a top-down approach, the fictional\nstand-in for a universal like \u201cblueness\u201d would behave like\na property, a sense or a meaning, that belongs to the conceptual\nscheme but would nonetheless qualify and serve to pick out the real\nblue particulars in the world. This can be accomplished, according to\nBuddhist Epistemologists, because the fictional proxies are, or can be\nanalyzed to be, \u201cexclusions of what is other\u201d\n(any\u0101poha), a type of double negation which applies to\nparticular patches of blue in the sense that each such patch is\n non-non-blue.[37]\n As Dign\u0101ga had put it in his\nS\u0101m\u0101nyapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 (\u201cAnalysis of\nUniversals\u201d):\n\n\nA word talks about entities only as they are qualified by the negation\nof other\n things.[38]\n\n\nIn fact, Dign\u0101ga applied his analysis both to things and to the\nwords that express them: non-non-blue is the universal-qua-object\n(arthas\u0101m\u0101nya) signified by the term\n\u201cblue\u201d, and non-non-\u201cblue\u201d is the\nuniversal-qua-word (\u015babdas\u0101m\u0101nya) that applies\nto particular articulations of the word \u201cblue\u201d. For\nDign\u0101ga, the signified-signifier (v\u0101cyav\u0101caka)\nrelation holds between these two\n quasi-universals.[39]\n\nWhy are they \u201cquasi\u201d and not full-fledged universals? The\nreasoning is not explicit in Dign\u0101ga. However, it can be\nplausibly reconstructed. Buddhist Epistemologists generally subscribed\nto the principle that mere absences of properties are of a lesser\nontological status than positive things. They would stress that\nnegative facts, like x not being blue, heavy, etc., are\nconstituted by our mere interests (i.e., we seek a blue thing at such\nand such a location and come away empty-handed), and are less real\nthan the fact that x causes perceptions of blue, a fact which\nis what it is objectively and independently of interests. It seems\nthat it is this general Buddhist intuition of the unreality of\nabsences upon which Dign\u0101ga relied. As the \u201cexclusion of\nwhat is other\u201d is itself only a negative property/absence of\nsomething rather than a presence, we are spared commitment to there\nbeing real universals in addition to real particulars.\n\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s approach in the fifth chapter of\nPram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya is indeed top-down in that he\nrelies upon the descriptive content of the apoha to pick out\nthe appropriate particulars. And top-down is also how the\n\u201cexclusion theory\u201d (apohav\u0101da) is presented\nin the works of non-Buddhist opponents of Dign\u0101ga, as well as in\nmodern works treating of the subject. Bimal K. Matilal interpreted the\ntheory in this fashion (see Matilal 1971, 41), as did Hans Herzberger.\nHerzberger (1975), developed an ingenious logical strategy, using some\npossibilities offered by Emil Post\u2019s theory of twofold propositions,\nto come up with what he termed a \u201cresourceful nominalism,\u201d\none that would explain how predicates applied non-arbitrarily to\nindividual things, that would account for our na\u00efve semantic\nintuitions, and that would nonetheless avoid ontological commitment to\nuniversals. Every proposition would be analyzable as an ordered pair\nof content and commitment\u2014\u201capohist double negation\u201d\nwould affirm content but deny ontological commitment. In what seems to\nbe at least partially a top-down approach, Mark Siderits has taken the\nrelevant double negation as involving two different types of negation,\nchoice and exclusion, so that it is the combination of the two that\npicks out a class of individuals, all the while staying\nnominalistically unengaged to universals (Siderits 1995; 2005).\nFinally, perhaps the most striking modern use of a comparable double\nnegation\u2014i.e., difference from others\u2014 is\nthe view in the Cours de linguistique\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale of Ferdinand de Saussure\nthat word-types and phonemes are only characterized by their\ndifferences from other ones in a system, although this\n19th\u201320th century Swiss structuralist was\nneither aware of possible 6th century parallels in Indian\nphilosophy nor motivated primarily by nominalist ontological\nworries (see D\u2019Ottavi 2010).\n\nIt remains far from clear, however, how genuine nominalist mileage is\nto be gained on a top-down approach, ingenious as it may be. The usual\ncharge against it by non-Buddhist critics, like Kum\u0101rila and\nUddyotakara, is circularity: if an understanding of blue is to be\nanalyzed as an understanding of non-non-blue and any negation\npresupposes understanding the negandum, then understanding what\nnon-non-blue is would depend on understanding blue\u2014we go round\nin circles. Hugon (2011) gives Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s response to that\ncharge, which consists essentially of a tu quoque\nargument\u2014one needs to understand what a term excludes as much as\nwhat it applies to. Hale (2011) reformulates the difficulty as being\nthat the Buddhist seems to run counter to the compositionality of\nlanguage; he argues that the non-Buddhist criticism will thus remain.\nThe problem is discussed intensely by Indo-Tibetan thinkers, like\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (for further discussion, see the entry on\n \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita)\n and Sa skya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita (see Hugon 2008, 479\u2013485,\n205\u2013210). What is striking is that while it can certainly be\nargued\u2014as these thinkers do\u2014that a meaningful term\npresents both a class of things to which it applies and another to\nwhich it does not apply, it is difficult to see how the latter would\nor should occupy a privileged place. Why would we understand words\nfirst and foremost by the via negativa?\n2.2.2 Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s causal version of apoha\n\nOn a bottom-up approach, on the other hand, the double exclusion plays\na comparatively minor role, and thus some of the\nKum\u0101rila-Uddyotakara criticisms may be less telling. Causal\nchains and error are what serve to bridge the scheme-content gap,\nrather than the descriptive content of the apoha. It is\nnotable that such reliance on causality seems to be entirely absent in\nDign\u0101ga: it is Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s major contribution to the\ntheory. The way words link to things is thus primarily explained\nthrough the existence of a causal chain from particular things to\nperceptions to thoughts and to the utterances of words\u2014in short\nwe have a type of causal theory of\n reference.[40]\n While modern day causal theories of reference\u2014such as that of\nSaul Kripke\u2014are typically used to explain how proper names can\nrefer without descriptive content, the theory can be extended in\nvarious ways to kind terms. Such is the move of Hilary Putnam who\nemphasized that descriptive content, or at its simplest just\n\u201cwhat is in one\u2019s head,\u201d is not enough to distinguish\nbetween seemingly similar kinds. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s causal theory too\nis not restricted to the reference of proper names, but also seeks to\nexplain causally reference to kinds of things. The causal connection\nis needed to guarantee \u201ccontact\u201d with the world, i.e.,\nthat language ultimately must rest upon perception, which is\nnon-abitrary in that it is \u201cfixed\u201d by things.\nDharmak\u012brti thus explains how an individual (to be called\n\u201cJones\u201d) can think about and refer to such and such an\nobject in the world through a complex and long causal chain from the\nparticular objects to the mental invention of a quasi-universal and\nthe use of a word on a specific occasion. Thoughts and talk of blue\nare thus about blue things because only blue things play the\nappropriate causal role in leading to the thought and finally the\n word.[41]\n\nHere are the bare bones of the causal account as we find it in the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika: Jones sees particular blue\nthings and they cause perceptual images (\u0101k\u0101ra) in\nhis mind; these images (and often other factors, like longstanding\nhabits) cause him to make the \u201csame judgment\u201d\n(ekapratyavamar\u015ba), \u201cThis is blue,\u201d a\njudgment to which appears an apoha, i.e., a generic\nrepresentation of non-non-blue. Because the particular perceptual\nimages all have the same effect in leading to the same judgment\n\u201cThis is blue\u201d, they all therefore share a key causal\npower and are grouped together. The judgments and resulting use of\nwords are about blue things, and not red things, precisely because\nthere is a causal chain from blue particulars and there isn\u2019t one from\nred\n particulars.[42]\n\nSo much for causal connections replacing real universals to group\nentities. How then do words refer to grouped entities via a causal\nchain? And how does the causal chain get passed on over time in a\ncommunity of speakers? It looks like we have something much like the\ntwo-fold process of reference-fixing and reference-borrowing that\nfigure in causal theories of\n reference.[43]\n\nThe initial reference-fixing is done \u201cat the time of\n[establishing] the linguistic convention\u201d\n (sa\u1e43ketak\u0101le)[44]\n by dubbing a sample case with the words, \u201cThis is blue\u201d.\nThis dubbing is a purely causal event not dependent on any descriptive\ncontent. It is an arbitrary choice, or speech-intention\n(vivak\u1e63\u0101), of the dubber to designate a blue\nsample with the term \u201cblue\u201d rather than\n another.[45]\n Other things will then also be grouped together under\n\u201cblue\u201d by the combination of perception and judgment\ndescribed above. This initial reference-fixing is then preserved in a\ncommonly respected convention that transmits the original intention\nand dubbing from speaker to\n speaker.[46]\n Subsequently \u201cat the time of using [language]\nconventions\u201d (vyavah\u0101rak\u0101le) other speakers\nwill rely on their previous habits, or \u201cimprints\u201d\n(v\u0101san\u0101), and the earlier reference-fixing that is\nnow a well-established convention in the community. Although speakers\ncould in principle use the word \u201cblue\u201d to refer to, say,\nthe colour of chocolate, practical considerations generally mean that\nthey won\u2019t: if someone wishes to tap into the causal chain transmitted\nfrom the initial dubbing, she will use \u201cblue\u201d for blue\nthings exclusively.\n\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s version of the apoha theory is developed\nin long sections in several chapters of\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika. No doubt, many questions\nneed a fuller treatment. Here are two of the main ones. (1) Given that\nthis is a causal rather than descriptive account of aboutness, what\nrole remains for the apoha, i.e., the double negations upon\nwhich Dign\u0101ga had placed so much emphasis? (2) Wouldn\u2019t having\nthe same powers to produce such and such a judgment depend on having\nsome common universals, or even itself be a common universal, and thus\nforce us to reinstate realism?\n\n(1)\nDharmak\u012brti and his commentators constantly account for the\nmental content of thought in terms of generic representations that are\n\u201cexclusions of what is other\u201d (any\u0101poha),\nthis from the \u201ctime of [establishing] the linguistic\nconvention\u201d (sa\u1e43ketak\u0101la) to the \u201ctime\nwhen one uses the convention\u201d\n(vyavah\u0101rak\u0101la). But if aboutness is indeed assured\ncausally, what is the theoretical interest of any\u0101poha?\nEither Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s theory of reference is not purely causal,\nbut is a hybrid theory involving both causal and descriptive\n elements,[47]\n or any\u0101poha is not there in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s theory\nto assure aboutness/reference but is his response to another type of\nconcern. Although there certainly are modern hybrid theories of\nreference combining the causal and the descriptive, it is not clear\nhow (or if) Dharmak\u012brti proposes to do that. What seems more\nlikely following\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti ad 68\u201375\nand ad 128 (see Dunne 2004, 134\u2013136 and 339\u2013352) is that\nany\u0101poha is there in the theory essentially to answer\nmetaphysical worries. Granted that we think that the mental content,\ni.e., the generic representation, has a distribution (anvaya)\nover several instances, is it genuinely distinct from or the same as\nthe instances? In the former case, it would not apply to them; in the\nlatter case it would itself be a particular and unable to apply to\nother particulars. The postulate of any\u0101poha is designed\nto avoid that dilemma of a quasi-universal being the same or\ndifferent\u2014it is neither as it unreal. As Dunne (2004, 136) puts\nit: \u201c\u2026by relegating distribution to a negation,\nDharmak\u012brti blocks any attempt at raising distribution (or a\ndistributed entity) to the level of ultimate reality.\u201d\n(2)\nThat multiple particulars all have the same power to produce the\nsame judgment is not, for Dharmak\u012brti, itself based on any\nunderlying same intrinsic features that would explain why this is so.\nIn Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika III.73\u201374 he cites a\nfamous example of different plants that all have the capacity to\nalleviate fever, but where one cannot point out any features in common\nthat would account for the fact that all the various plants work as\nfebrifuges. Similarly for particulars all causing the same judgment:\nthere is no common property that would explain why this\n happens.[48]\n But can\u2019t one say that all of them having that capacity just\nis possession of a common universal, i.e. having the power to\nproduce the same judgment? Lacking that common universal-feature, how\ncould we judge that the particulars have the same power? This argument\nshould seem d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for the nominalist. We\u2019ve\ncome full circle back to realist\u2019s basic worry: how could we group\nthings without there being some real universal in common?\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s response is to say that in fact particulars don\u2019t\nreally possess a common power, if one means by that a power that would\nitself be a universal. The powers themselves are all particulars and\ndiffer from each other\u2014the way one plant works is not the way\nthe other works to cure fever and the way one blue particular causes\nthe judgment \u201cThis is blue\u201d differs from the way another\ndoes. These multiple ways exhibit no intrinsic properties in common\nthat would explain why they all work to produce a desired common\neffect. At most there is just the negative grouping of being distinct\nfrom everything which lacks the power, and that, as we know by now, is\nan apoha and not a real property.\n\n",
