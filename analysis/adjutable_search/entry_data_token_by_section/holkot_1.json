    "main_text": "Relation to Ockham || Ockham\u2019s influence\n2.1 Ockham\u2019s influence\n\nAlthough Holkot was a Dominican, well versed in the texts of Aquinas,\nhis philosophy and theology owe much more to the scholastics of the\nfourteenth century than to the thirteenth. William Ockham exercised\nthe most important influence. The hallmarks of Ockham\u2019s\nphilosophy are: his reduction of Aristotle\u2019s ten categories of\nbeing to substance and quality; his analysis of the other eight\ncategories and many other terms of philosophical art as connotative\nterms, best understood as exponible into more fundamental absolute\nterms denoting substances and qualities; his rejection of\nAristotle\u2019s final, formal and material causes as properly\ncausal, keeping only efficient causality; his conception of mental\nlanguage as a logical thought structure existing independently of\nspoken language; his reformulation of the prevailing views about\nreference (supposition theory) to accommodate his spare metaphysics;\nhis rejection of species as necessary for knowledge in favor of\nintuitive cognition or the direct intellectual cognition of objects;\nand his view that the ethical precepts of the Ten Commandments are not\nabsolute but subject to divine will, such that God could, without\ncontradiction, have created a system in which moral good involves\nobeying the opposite of each of the traditional commands. Holkot\nassumed most of Ockham\u2019s philosophical positions as\nfoundational, taking them for granted in the development of his\ntheology.\n\nHolkot was not much concerned with defending or exploring his\nOckhamist philosophical presumptions. They appear as premises,\nscattered throughout his texts, rather than subjects of extended\nanalysis.\n",
