    "main_text": "Applications || Self-promises\n6.3 Self-promises\n\nSuppose it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day, and you \u2013 sick of your\nown bad habits \u2013 decide to make a change. You say to yourself:\n\u201cI promise to cut down on screen time this year.\u201d Do you\nnow owe it to yourself to follow through? Does your resolution even\ncount as a bona fide promise?\n\nThe possibility of self-promises \u2013 and their possible import\n\u2013 has drawn the attention a number of philosophers. Some are\nskeptical (e.g., Downie 1985); others, less so (Fruh 2014; Habib 2009;\nHill, Jr 1991a; Raz 1972, 97; Rosati 2011).\n\nOn the one hand, promises to oneself can seem not just possible but\ndownright useful. When we struggle to commit our wills in the ordinary\nways \u2013 focusing on attractive aspects, \u201cpsyching ourselves\nup\u201d \u2013 we often reach for other devices of commitment\n(Schelling 1985). A promise to oneself may be just such a device. By\nsaying things like \u201cI promise to cut down on screen\ntime,\u201d we are not saying, \u201cBoy, I\u2019d better\ncut down,\u201d or \u201cGee, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if\nI cut down?\u201d We are moralizing. We are staking our self-respect\non a decision in order to get ourselves to carry it out (see Hill, Jr\n1991a), or as Rosati (2011, 143\u201344) puts it, we try to\n\u201cmaintain our self-governance\u2026by putting our authority on\nthe line\u201d \u2013 that is, our authority over ourselves, our\nauthority to \u201ceffectively determine what we shall do, and to\ncommand respect in virtue of that very authority.\u201d It is like\nvowing \u201con my honor.\u201d It is a distinctive means of\nself-motivation.\n\nOn the other hand, promises to oneself do have a funny smell. If you\npromise me something, I have the power to release you. If you promise\nyourself, then it seems you can release yourself at\nwill, which sounds paradoxical \u2013 and familiar. In Singer\u2019s\nview, this is just a special instance of the Paradox of Self-Release,\nwhich afflicts any kind of duty to oneself. He asks:\n\nCan one promise oneself to do something? Such language is frequently\nused. People say \u201cI have promised myself to\u2026\u201d But a\npromise to oneself would be a promise from which one could release\noneself at will, and thus not a genuine promise at all. (1958, 203)\n\n\nOthers have raised similar worries. Atiyah writes:\n\nIt is very odd to regard a secret vow to oneself as creating an\nobligation of any kind. If it does, [it] is one without a\ncorresponding right \u2026 [and] which can be violated without risk\nof legal, moral or social censure. (1981, 54)\n\n\nHere Atiyah echoes Singer\u2019s skepticism about duties without\nrights, as well as raising other worries.\n\nA \u201cpromise to oneself,\u201d Singer concludes, can only be a\nresolution in disguise. A genuine promise generates a duty, owed by\nthe promisor to the promisee. A self-promise, however, just expresses\na \u201csettled determination\u201d to act. It is a figurative use\nof moral language, or else it is nonsense.\n\nBut as we have seen, there are replies to the Paradox of Self-Release,\nand so it should come as no surprise that there are arguments in favor\nof genuine self-promises \u2013 which may not be as funny as they\nseemed at first whiff.\n\nTo start, self-promising is not some strange contortion only performed\nby characters in thought experiments. As Rosati (2011, 124\u201325)\nobserves, we at least seem to make self-promises about a \u201cbroad\narray\u201d of things \u2013 self-care, self-respect, moral\nrectitude, choice of lifestyle \u2013 and in a wide variety of ways,\nfrom silent vows to showy announcements. Self-promising is, in a word,\nnormal. But this by itself is not a decisive point, as Rosati\nherself would agree, since Singer could reinterpret our ordinary talk\nof self-promises as merely figurative, a way of steeling one\u2019s\nwill rather than conjuring a moral obligation.\n\nSecond, we might return to Allen\u2019s reply to Singer: we\nshouldn\u2019t be so quick to dismiss ordinary talk. Why think that\nself-promises must be figures of speech?\n\nThird, we could try to find special cases where Singer\u2019s\nskepticism is harder to believe. Allen Habib (2009) gives the example\nof a contest in which a sales manager promises her team \u2013 self\nincluded \u2013 that she will give $100 to next week\u2019s top\nseller; another of his examples is a drinker who backslides on a\nself-promise to go sober. Hill (1991a, 147) explores cases where a\npromise to oneself must be reconsidered \u201cin the light of\nunanticipated new information\u201d that tells in favor of annulment\n\u2013 on Hill\u2019s view, this kind of release is not problematic,\nbecause it is not done willy-nilly. Janis Schaab presents a similar\ncase:\n\nSuppose that I want to buy a new laptop, and so I promise myself to\nsave some money. A few days later, I am informed that my salary will\nbe raised. I can now afford to buy the new laptop rightaway\n[sic]. It seems that now, if not before, I can release myself\nfrom my promise to save money. It is not obvious that the mere\npossibility of self-release nullifies my obligation to save\nmoney. (2021, 177)\n\n\nFinally, we might defend the coherence of willy-nilly waivers.\nCertainly this is a bit easier if we already believe in the\npossibility of releasing oneself from other duties to self, like the\nduty not to harm (see \u00a75, above). The trick is the same either\nway: we say that the person is bound until the moment of\nrelease. The pioneer of this move in the promising literature is\nConnie Rosati, who writes:\n\nWe would not be tempted to say that because the promisee can release\nthe promisor at will, the promisor is not really obligated. So long as\nthe promisee has not released the promisor, she is indeed bound. But\nthen we should say the same thing about self-promises: although an\nagent, as promisee, can release herself, as promisor, at will, so\nlong as she does not release herself, she is indeed bound. (2011,\n134\u201335; see also Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 697)\n\nThis view raises its own puzzle, analogous to Schofield\u2019s\nchallenge to Mu\u00f1oz (see again \u00a75). If a self-promise can\nbe waived at will, so that there is no real danger of violating it,\nwhy should it matter?\n\nOne possible answer is the one we started with: self-promising is a\nway of staking our respect to add some moral oomph to an\nintention. This still leaves us wondering where the oomph\ncomes from, if not the threat of a broken promise. Here the friends of\nself-promising need to find some way that release might be non-trivial\neven if it is possible \u2013 just as Kanygina (forthcoming) argues\nthat self-release requires us to make decisions autonomously, and\nSchaab (2021) argues that the power of self-release does not fully\nprotect us against the possibility of violation. Fruh (2014, 170) goes\nsome way towards an answer; he argues that, just because one\ncan dissolve an obligation easily, that doesn\u2019t make\nthe act morally meaningless; the dissolution might express\nsomething undesirable, such as a deficiency of \u201cmoral\nfiber.\u201d A lack of fiber probably won\u2019t strike fear into\nevildoers\u2019 hearts. But it is a defect nonetheless.\n",
