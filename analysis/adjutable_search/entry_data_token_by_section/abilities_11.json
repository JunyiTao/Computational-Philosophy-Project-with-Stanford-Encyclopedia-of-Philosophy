    "main_text": "Modal theories of ability || The modal analysis\n4.1 The modal analysis\n\nIntuitively, claims about ability are claims about possibility. It is\nin some sense a truism that someone is able to perform some act just\nin case it is possible for her to perform it.\n\nTo develop this purported truism, begin with the thought that for\nS to have an ability to A it is necessary, but not\nsufficient, that it be possible that S does A. This\nclaim will be contentious for various more specialized sorts of\npossibility, such as nomic possibility. But if we may help\nourselves to the idea of possibility simpliciter\n(\u2018metaphysical possibility,\u2019\u00a0on at least one reading\nof that phrase), then this claim appears plausible. (We will survey\nsome historical and contemporary challenges to it below in Section\n4.2.) On the other hand it seems implausible that this sort of\npossibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of acts\nthat that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent might\nnonetheless not be able to perform.\n\nThis suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability is for it to be\npossible to A in some restricted sense of\npossibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to the laws\nof nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative to what\nan agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some\nindependently specifiable set of conditions.\n\nTo render this hypothesis precisely, we may help ourselves to the\nformal framework of \u2018possible worlds,\u2019 which offers an\nelegant and powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework,\na proposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible\nworld. We can then say an agent is able to A just in case she performs\nthat act at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some\nindependently specifiable set of conditions.\n\nWe thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability:\n\n(MA) S has the ability to A iff S\ndoes A at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition\nC.\n\n\n(MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a\ngeneral family of analyses. Different members of this family will be\ndistinguished by the different candidates they might propose for C, as\nwell as whether they quantify over individual worlds or sets of\nworlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient theoretical\nunity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of abstraction,\nas a single approach to the analysis of ability.\n\nTwo points about (MA) bear noting. First, \u2018modal\u2019 here is\nbeing used in a relatively strict and narrow way. Sometimes\n\u2018modal\u2019 is used loosely to describe phenomena that are\nconnected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. As\nnoted above, it is a truism that there is some connection between\nability and necessity, and so that ability is in this loose sense\n\u2018modal.\u2019 The proponent of (MA) is concerned with modality\nin a stricter sense: she proposes that ability may be analyzed in\nterms of the precise framework of propositions and possible worlds\njust adumbrated. The opponent of (MA), in turn, grants that ability\nhas something to do with possibility but denies that any such analysis\nsucceeds.\n\nSecond, while (MA) has been presented as an alternative to (CA), (CA)\nis arguably just one particular version of (MA). For, as noted above,\n(CA) appeals to a subjunctive conditional, and the standard semantics\nfor the subjunctive conditional (developed in slightly different ways\nin Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973) is told in terms of quantification\nover possible worlds. Specifically (on Stalnaker\u2019s version) a\nsubjunctive conditional is true just in case its consequent is true at\nthe world where its antecedent is true that is otherwise maximally\nsimilar to the actual world. In these terms, (CA) is roughly\nequivalent to the following:\n\n(CAmodal) S has the ability to A\niff S does A at a world at which S tries\nto A that is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world.\n\n\nThis is patently a version of (MA), with \u2018S tries\nto A and is otherwise maximally similar to the actual\nworld\u2019 serving as condition C.\n\nIf this is correct, then most discussions of the analysis on ability\nin the twentieth century have focused on a special and somewhat\nidiosyncratic case of a much broader program of analysis, namely the\nprogram of giving a modal analysis of ability. The considerations\nbrought forth in the remainder of this section, in contrast, are\nconcerned with the general case.\n",
