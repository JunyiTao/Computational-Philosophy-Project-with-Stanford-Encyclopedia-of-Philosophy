Later Books\n\nStrawson published three more books (other than collections of essays)\nin English (plus another in French which overlaps with one of those in\nEnglish). In 1974 Subject and Predicate in Logic and Grammar\nappeared. Strawson himself described this book as \u2018probably the\nmost ambitious and certainly the one that has received the least\nattention\u2019 (Strawson 2004, ix). He is right about the second\npoint but not, we suspect, about the first. It is an ambitious book,\nbut can hardly be ranked above either Individuals or The\nBounds of Sense in that respect! In the first part of it Strawson\npresents a revised version of his account of the normal\nsubject-predicate distinction, and also presents a partial theory of\none particular case of subject expressions, namely proper names. In\nthis he was responding to the emergence of direct referential accounts\nof the kind that Kripke had made popular. The discussion of the\nsubject-predicate distinction is clearer and more direct than the one\nachieved in Individuals. What Strawson particularly brings\nout is that in ordinary language predicates have a complex role,\ninvolving the indication of universals, the expression of\nexemplification, plus expression also of temporal aspects. This\nfunctional complexity explains the correctness of certain other\naccounts of the distinction. No consensus about the assessment of\nStrawson\u2019s proposal has emerged, the reason being that there has\nstill been no very general interest in the subject-predicate\ndistinction. In the second part, Strawson develops an approach to the\nunderstanding of grammar in which he attempts to relate grammar, in\nthe sense of syntax, to much more basic functional specifications of\nthe elements of a language, such that it becomes possible to see\nactual grammars as different ways to achieve these functional roles.\nAgain, no consensus has emerged about this highly original way to\nthink about grammar.\n\nIn 1985 Strawson published Skepticism and Naturalism: Some\nVarieties. The book grew out of Strawson\u2019s Woodbridge\nLectures at Columbia University in 1983. It is, in a sense, a book of\nphilosophy about philosophy. In each chapter Strawson focuses\non a philosophical dispute in which there is a strong tendency to deny\nthe reality or existence of an aspect which common sense affirms. The\nterm \u2018skepticism\u2019 in the title stands for this general\nsceptical tendency. The first chapter concerns knowledge itself,\ndenied by the philosophical sceptic. The later chapters consider the\ndenial of certain aspects of ordinary human thought and experience,\nsuch as the reality of colour by scientifically inspired philosophers,\nand the reality of thought and experience by a certain sort of\nmaterialist. The thread linking these chapters is the sceptical\nthought that these aspects of our ordinary human experience are to be\nfound wanting on account of their not being reducible to a more\nscientifically acceptable, physicalist base. In each case,\nStrawson\u2019s aim is to deny the denial, and to explain, as one\nmight say, how philosophers can have their cake and eat it. Against\nthe sceptic about knowledge, Strawson stresses that the claims that\nthey deny are presuppositions of all human thought and enquiry;\nagainst the reductive naturalist he goes further, not only stressing\nthe inescapability of the ordinary human standpoint but also allowing\nit its own validity from its own particular standpoint.\n\nThe book is about philosophy in another sense, since it employs and\nilluminates some ideas from earlier philosophers, especially Hume and\nWittgenstein, and reveals Strawson\u2019s very deep understanding of\nthem. The book marks, also, a further development in Strawson\u2019s\nengagement with epistemological scepticism. Strawson expresses\nagreement with some of his earlier critics (in particular Stroud) that\ntranscendental arguments are problematic as anti-sceptical devices,\nand suggests instead that scepticism can be set aside because no-one\nis persuaded by sceptical arguments. Philosophical sceptical doubts\nare not serious doubts, and so are not to be taken\nseriously. This further twist in Strawson\u2019s\nepistemology has, again, inspired considerable debate, and no\nconsensus has yet emerged. In particular, it remains to be determined\nhow strongly we should take Strawson\u2019s suggestions that certain\nclaims are presuppositions on human thought and enquiry. One worry\nwhich remains is that Strawson\u2019s point that no one is remotely\ninclined to accept the sceptic\u2019s claim establishes at most that\nwe regard such arguments as having the status of defending a\nparadoxical conclusion; it does not, in itself, explain why the\nconclusion is incorrect. However, as well as being an original\ncontribution to epistemology, the book presents an approach to\nontology which deserves to be called Oxonian, because it has been\npopular in Oxford. The idea is that there is no good reason not to be\nrealists about most aspects of the world, including colour, mentality,\nmeaning, and perhaps value, but that this does not require the defence\nof a reduction to some features of a supposedly more\nfundamental realm. This is a relaxed realism that does not\nset its face against the claims of natural science, but rather refuses\nto take them as calling into question the legitimacy of our ordinary\nways of thinking about the world. This form of Oxford realism was\ninfluential on a generation of British philosophers, many of whom were\nStrawson\u2019s students.\n\nFinally, in 1992, Strawson published Analysis and Metaphysics: an\nIntroduction to Philosophy. Strawson had given introductory\nlectures once he became a professor, and the lectures became this\nbook. It is, again, a book about philosophy, contrasting different\nconceptions of the subject, and defending Strawson\u2019s own\nconception of the nature and value of analysis. Of importance here is\nStrawson\u2019s distinction between reductive and connective\nanalysis. Strawson\u2019s attitude is that the aim of analysis is to\nreveal conceptual links and connexions, thereby illuminating some\nfeatures of our concepts, but that there is no favoured basic level of\nthought to which it is the goal of philosophical analysis to reduce\neverything else. Echoing the name for his conception of ontology, one\nmight call that a conception of relaxed analysis. Strawson in\nfact repeatedly wrote about the nature of philosophy, and the views in\nthis book are his final conclusions. It is also a book in which he\npractises what he preaches in relation to certain chosen areas,\nincluding, for example, the topics of causation and explanation,\nexperience, meaning, and freedom. Whether it is a good introductory\nbook or not, it is certainly a deep and interesting treatment of its\ntopics for the non-beginner! Strawson himself prepares the reader by\nremarking brilliantly that the book \u2018though introductory\n\u2026 is not elementary. There is no such thing as elementary\nphilosophy. There is no shallow end to the philosophical pool\u2019\n(Strawson 1992, vii).\n",
