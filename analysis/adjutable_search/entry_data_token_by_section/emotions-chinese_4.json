    "main_text": "Emotions and Qing in Early Chinese Philosophy || Meanings of Qing\n2.2 Meanings of Qing\n\nQing, in modern Chinese, means emotions and subjective\nfeelings. \u611f\u60c5 (ganqing) means feeling and \u60c5\u7eea\n(qingxu) means affective mood. In early Chinese texts in the\npre-Han (500 to 200 BCE) period, however, the term qing does\nnot always refers to emotional states of the mind. It can mean real\nfacts, truth, or essence that does not seem to have any relation to\ninner subjective states of the mind. Graham (1990: 59\u201365) argues\nthat, in pre-Han literature, qing should not be understood as\n\u201cpassions\u201d. Instead, it should be understood as \u201cthe\nfacts\u201d or what is \u201cgenuine\u201d. Although in some texts,\nthe Xunzi, for instance, qing is used in the\ncontexts of feelings and emotions, in other texts, such as the\nMozi and the Sunzi bingfa (\u5b6b\u5b50\u5175\u6cd5 the Art\nof War), it means essence, nature, genuineness, situation, and\nreality with little semantic affinity to emotions or subjective\nfeelings. For this reason, many sinologists and comparative\nphilosophers (Bruya 2003; Eifring 2004b; Graham 1990; Hansen 1995;\nHarbsmeier 2004; Middendorf 2008; Puett 2004; Vir\u00e1g 2017)\ndiscuss the polysemy of qing in early Chinese texts and\nanalyze its peculiar patterns of emergence and development in the\npre-Han period. Regarding the meaning of qing in pre-Han\ntexts, Graham (1990: 59) states that \u201cAs a noun it\n[qing] means \u2018the facts\u2019\u2026, as an adjective\n\u2018genuine\u2019\u2026, as an adverb\n\u2018genuinely\u2019\u201d. By following Graham\u2019s (1990)\ninterpretation of qing, Eifring (2019: 190) develops a\nnon-psychological interpretation of qing (i.e., qing\nas nature, essence, or genuineness) in pre-Han Confucian and Daoist\ntexts. He states that \n\n\nqing is hardly used in the sense of \u2018emotion\u2019 at\nall\u2026The term itself has a number of different meanings, most of\nthem clearly related, and when the meaning \u2018emotion\u2019\ngradually emerges, some of these meanings still continue to vibrate\nalong, suggesting that emotions are genuine and that they belong to\nhuman nature. \n\n\nFollowing the same line of interpretation, Ivanhoe and Van Norden\n(2001: 391) define qing as \u201c\u2018the genuine\u2019,\n\u2018essence\u2019, or \u2018disposition\u2019\u201d. They state\nthat \n\n\nThe qing of something is what it genuinely is, as opposed to\nwhat it might appear to be. This is often conceived of in terms of how\nit would spontaneously behave and develop if given a proper\nenvironment and support. More specifically, some interpreters have\nargued that the qing of a thing can be the essential\ncharacteristics of that thing. Toward the end of the Warring States\nperiod, qing came to refer to human emotions or dispositions\n(perhaps because some thinkers regarded these as essential to human\nbeings). \n\n\nAdding more semantic details, Santangelo (2007: 296) states that the\nmost common Chinese term, qing is \n\n\na polysemous word that basically means: \u201cfeeling or affective\nstate of mind\u201d, \u201cinclination or desire\u201d,\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d, \u201cauthenticity\u201d. Even if we\nconsider the most common terms that are usually translated into\nEnglish as \u201cemotion\u201d, qinggan or\nganqing, in fact they express a semantic space different from\nthe English or Italian equivalents. \n\n\nAs these interpretations and reports show, qing, unlike the\ncommon meaning of emotion in modern Chinese, has non-psychological\nmeanings (nature, essence, reality etc.) in pre-Han Chinese texts that\nmay coexist with psychological meanings (feelings, inclinations,\ndesires, etc.) of qing. Seok (2013: 140), therefore, explains\nthe meanings of qing in three dimensions: ontological\n(dynamic nature, human existence), epistemological (sense of reality\nand experience), and psychological/moral (emotional expressions and\nfeelings) dimensions. He states that \n\n\ndifferent meanings of qing such as the essential identity of\nthings, affective states of the mind, and the concrete understanding\nof situation/reality are all related to the open interactive and\nembodied interaction between the self and the world. \n\n\nHarbsmeier (2004: 71) provides probably the most comprehensive list of\nqing\u2019s meanings. According to him, qing has\nfollowing meanings in the pre-Buddhist (before 1st century CE)\nChina.\n\n Factual: The basic facts of a matter. This particularly common in\nhistorical and \u201cscientific\u201d prose.\n Metaphysical: Underlying and basic dynamic factors. This is\nparticularly common in YI [Yijing, the Book of\nChanges] and philosophical writings.\n Political: Basic popular sentiments/responses. This occurs in\nwritings on political theory.\n Anthropological: General basic instincts/propensities. This is\nparticularly common in writings on ritual and philosophy.\n Positive: Essential sensibilities and sentiments, viewed as\ncommendable. This is particularly cultivated in Taoist writings.\n Personal: Basic motivation/attitude. This is particularly common\nin historical texts and texts on political philosophy. \n\n",
