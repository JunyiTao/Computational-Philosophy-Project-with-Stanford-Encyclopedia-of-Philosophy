    "main_text": "Focus of aesthetic experience || Form and Function\n1.1 Form and Function\n\nLong before the 18th-century development of special theories of\naesthetic experience, neo-Platonic medieval philosophers developed a\nconcept of beauty as rationally intelligible formal structure as it\ncould be appreciated in experience. In his fourth-century work De\nMusica, Augustine took beauty in music to be partly a matter of\nproportionality of parts, and later argued that visual beauty is\nformal harmony combined in the right way with color (Haldane 2013).\nNine centuries later, Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica)\nechoed this hylomorphic conception: the beautiful is material\nstructured in proper form, the kind \u201cof which apprehension in\nitself pleases\u201d (\u201cPulchrum dicatur id cujus apprehensio\nipsa placet,\u201d \u00a7 Ia, IIae, q.27, a.1 ad 3; as\ntranslated by Mothersill 1988, p. 323). In the Italian Renaissance,\nLeon Battista Alberti (1443\u20131452 [1988]) called beauty\n\u201creasoned harmony of all the parts within a body\u201d (Book 6,\n\u00a72 at p.156).\n\nIn the eighteenth century, attention to aesthetic experience per se,\nrather than beauty, grew out of a more general inquiry into\nperception. Alexander Baumgarten (1735 [1954]) first defined\n\u201caesthetics\u201d much more broadly as we do now\u2014as the\nscience of cognizing objects by sensory perception (from the Greek\n\u201caisth\u00easis\u201d for sensory perception).\nBaumgarten\u2019s work on the topic was heavily influenced by that of\nLeibniz (1684 [1969]) and Wolff (1719 [2003]). All three took pleasure\nmore generally to be sensory perception of an object\u2019s\nperfection; Wolff treated this as the coherence of the aspects of an\nobject either in themselves or as they work together to accomplish a\npurpose.\n\nThese early claims that experience of beauty is experience of form\nwere thoroughly integrated into the general theistic metaphysics and\nepistemology of these thinkers. Baumgarten, for instance, claimed that\nwe take pleasure not only in the perfection of an object, he wrote,\nbut also in being conscious of our own \u201cperfection of sensible\ncognition as such,\u201d in how we are suited to sense the world\n(1750 [2007] \u00a714; cf. Meier 1999 and Mendelssohn 1785 [1979]).\nThe contemporary English philosopher Anthony Ashbury Cooper, the Third\nEarl of Shaftesbury (1711 [2007]), took pleasurable admiration of\nwell-formed objects really to be admiration of the form-imposing\nminds, including those of the artist but ultimately that of the\ndivine. \u201cThe beautifying, not the beautified, is the really\nbeautiful,\u201d he wrote (Cahn and Meskin 2007, p. 80).\n\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s immensely influential Critique of\nJudgment (1789 [1987]) peeled aesthetic experience away from\napprehension of the divine, and cleaved the apprehension of form away\nfrom function. He claimed you make a pure judgment of\n(\u201cfree\u201d) beauty when you take pleasure just in perceiving\nthe form of an object without even conceptualizing its function.\n\nKant clearly contradicts his German predecessors in his claim that\n\u201cneither does perfection gain by beauty, nor beauty by\nperfection\u201d (\u00a716 at p. 78). Nonetheless, Kant does make two\nkinds of theoretical concessions to this tradition. First, he allows\nthat his German predecessors like Baumgarten may have confused\nperfection for a purpose with a subjective kind of purposiveness\nwithout reference to any specific purpose. This latter\n\u201cpurposiveness\u201d is difficult to understand, but Kant\nsuggests that it consists in the harmony of an object\u2019s parts,\nas presented in experience, that allows you to unite them in your\nimagination into a structured unity (\u00a715, p. 74; see Section\n2.3). Secondly, Kant concedes that we sometimes speak of\n\u201cbeauty,\u201d e.g. the beauty of a building, when we highlight\nhow something is perfect for its function. Kant calls this\n\u201caccessory beauty\u201d (or \u201cadherent beauty,\u201d\nanother translation of \u201cpulchritude adhaerens\u201d)\n(\u00a716 at p. 76).\n\nKant is often cited as a \u201cformalist\u201d\u2014someone who\nclaims that aesthetic experience focuses exclusively on formal\nproperties of objects\u2014but this is a matter of interpretive\ndispute. What is clear is that Kant offered a way into understanding\naesthetic experience\u2019s focus on form independently from its\nassociation with the divine or with any function that form might\nfulfill.\n\nMost German work on aesthetics in the nineteenth century moved away\nfrom focus on mere form to discuss the special knowledge that\naesthetic experience might afford (see Section 1.5). Interest in form\nwithout function saw resurgence in the final decades of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nIn The Birth of Tragedy (1872 [1992]), Friedrich Nietzsche\nargued that the artistic form of a tragedy\u2014its rhythm, its\nmusical shapes, its overarching structure\u2014could transfigure the\nfundamental facts of human suffering that would otherwise overwhelm\nand paralyze us. In such transfiguration by form, we come to take\n\u201caesthetic pleasure\u201d (\u00a724 at pp. 140\u20131,) in\nwhat would otherwise be horrible (cf. Bullough 1912 [2007]). Formal\nstructure produces a necessary, salutary illusion in our perception of\nterrible and otherwise unmanageable truths.\n\nThe influential Austrian music critic Eduard Hanslick argued in 1891\n[2007] that only pure form in music could be beautiful, and its lack\nof any \u201csubject\u201d was no discredit to it. In a partial\nreturn to Kant, George Santayana (1896) gave form a particularly\nimportant role to play in grounding beauty in all art forms. He said\nthat you can take self-conscious pleasure in synthesizing various\ndistinct perceptions of elements of an object to come to perceive it\nas a structured whole.\n\nIn response to the late 19th- and early\n20th-century development of abstract and\nnon-representational styles in the visual arts, a greater resurgence\nin formalism took place (Stolnitz 1960; Carroll 2013). The visual art\ncritic Clive Bell (1914 [2007]) took aesthetic experience to be a\nresponse to what he called \u201cSignificant Form\u201d in a piece\nof visual art, i.e. \u201carrangements and combinations that move us\nin a particular way\u201d to \u201caustere and thrilling\nraptures\u201d distinct from those feelings we encounter otherwise\n(p.264, 268). In contrast, the \u201crepresentative element\u201d is\nalways \u201cirrelevant\u201d to such aesthetic experience\n(p.27).\n\nA significant twist in the history of formalism came with John\nDewey\u2019s landmark 1934 [1980] book Art as Experience. In\nit, Dewey emphasized primarily that aesthetic experience was an\nexperience which itself had a unified, consummatory form with\nmeaningful development. Understood in this way, an aesthetic\nexperience can be an experience of any event or object which offers\nsuch a \u201csingle quality that pervades the entire experience in\nspite of the variation of its constituent parts\u201d (pp.\n305\u20136 as reprinted in Cahn and Meskin 2007). What it is for some\nexperience to be \u201cesthetic\u201d is not for it to be an\nexperience of some form, but rather for it to be an\nexperience that has an internal phenomenological structure that\nconstitutes its own form. You might have this kind of\nexperience at an exciting baseball game, watching a sunset, or writing\na paper.\n\nDewey\u2019s methodology had an outsized impact on aesthetics in\nanalytic philosophy. This impact even survived the influence of\nWittgenstein\u2019s later work (see 1953 [2009]), which many took to\nthreaten the possibility of phenomenological inquiry in general.\nDewey\u2019s turn towards the primacy of the form of\naesthetic experience\u2014rather than the form of an object\nof aesthetic experience\u2014can be found most notably in the work of\nMonroe Beardsley (1958 [1981], 1970 [1982]). Beardsley is known partly\nas a hedonist, because he thought that aesthetic experiences were\nnecessarily pleasurable or \u201cgratifying.\u201d But it is not\njust any gratification that counts towards an experience\u2019s being\naesthetic. Aesthetic experiences tend to gratifying because\nthey are intense, unified, complete experiences focused on single\nobjects whose features reward curiosity and active attention. It is\ntrue that only a certain kind of object of attention could offer such\na perceptual encounter\u2014but it is the form of the experience so\noffered that is explanatorily prior, rather than the form of the\nobject.\n\nFormalism has now fallen out of favor, and is generally regarded as an\nextreme view about aesthetic experience. There are a few common\nobjections to formalism as the view that aesthetic experience focuses\nexclusively on the formal properties of objects.\n\nSome try to undercut a central motivation for formalism: the\nmotivation to find a \u201ccommon denominator\u201d in all types of\naesthetic objects, both artefactual and natural (Carroll 2012).\nEspecially after Wittgenstein (1953 [2009]) challenged the possibility\nof providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the application\nof certain concepts, many philosophers of aesthetics thought that\ntrying to define \u201cart\u201d was a lost cause\u2014perhaps a\ncause antithetical to the radical \u201copenness\u201d (Weitz 1956)\nor \u201cessentially contested\u201d (Gallie 1956) nature of the\nconcept of art.\n\nFormalism crucially relies on the distinction between form and other\nfeatures of artworks, notably the content of artworks. But\nit\u2019s not clear how to draw a clean line between form and\ncontent, especially when it comes to art forms like instrumental music\n(Isenberg 1973). According to prolific Victorian critic Walter Pater\n(1873 [1986]), in music \u201cthe end is not distinct from the means,\nthe form from the matter, the subject from the expression; they inhere\nin and completely saturate each other,\u201d and it is the\n\u201cconstant effort of art to obliterate\u201d this distinction\n(p.86).\n\nA more specific version of this objection targets Bell\u2019s (1914\n[2007]) version of formalism. His theory relied not only on a\ndistinction between form and content, but also on an obscure\ndistinction between significant and insignificant form (Stolnitz 1960,\np.144).\n\nA third powerful line of criticism originated in work on the social\nstructures of aesthetic appreciation. Arthur Danto (1964) famously\nargued, with special reference to Andy Warhol\u2019s Brillo\nBoxes installation, that art can be formally indistinguishable\nfrom things that aren\u2019t art, and so whether something\ncounts as art cannot be a matter of its form, but must partly\nbe a matter of a certain kind of theory we apply. George Dickie (1974,\n1984) extended this idea to cover the claim that aesthetic\nappreciation per se is only available in the context of certain social\ninstitutions with their own patterns of value (see Guyer 2014c, p.\n479, for further criticism). Kendall Walton (1970) likewise argued\nthat the pleasure we take in an artwork\u2019s formal features\ndepends crucially on the category in which we perceive it.\n\nWhile a purely formalist approach to aesthetic experience might\neffectively mark what is distinctive about aesthetic experience, it\ndoes not readily explain what is valuable about aesthetic experience.\nEspecially when form is taken independently of function or\napprehension of the divine, it\u2019s not clear why it would even be\npleasant, let alone important, to have experiences that focus only on\nform. Dewey\u2019s (1934 [1980]) turn doesn\u2019t help here: is it\nall that valuable to have experiences with internal growth and a\nfeeling of consummation? Is this value great enough to justify all the\ntime and money we spend pursuing aesthetic experience?\n\nAlthough formalism has fallen from grace, even its critics accept the\nimportance of appreciating form among other features in aesthetic\nexperience (Carroll 2006, p. 78).\n",
