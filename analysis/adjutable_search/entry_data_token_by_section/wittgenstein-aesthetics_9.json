    "main_text": "The Comparative Approach || Critical Reasoning\n3.1 Critical Reasoning\n\n\nThese foregoing matters together lead to what is to my mind central to\nWittgenstein's thoughts on aesthetics. In observing that on one\nhearing of a minuet we may get a lot out of it and on the next hearing\nnothing, he is showing how easy it can be to take conceptual missteps\nin our aesthetic thought from which it can prove difficult to\nrecover. From such a difference, against how we can all too easily\nmodel the matter, it does not follow that what we get out of the\nminuet is independent of the minuet. That would constitute an\nimposition of a Cartesian dualism between the two ontologies of mind\nand matter, but in its aesthetic guise. And that would lead in turn to\ntheories of aesthetic content of a mental kind, where the materials of\nthe art form (materials we would then call \u201cexternal\u201d\nmaterials) only serve to carry the real, internal or non-physical\ncontent. Criticism would thus be a process of arguing inferentially\nfrom outward evidence back to inward content; creation would be a\nprocess of finding outward correlates or carriers for that prior\ninward content; and artistic intention would be articulated as a full\nmental pre-conception of the contingently finished (or\n\u201cexternalized\u201d, as we would then call it) work. It is no\naccident that Wittgenstein immediately moves to the analogy to\nlanguage and our all-too-easy misconception of linguistic meaning,\nwhere we make \u201cthe mistake of thinking that the meaning or\nthought is just an accompaniment of the word, and the word doesn't\nmatter\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 25). This indeed would prove\nsufficient to motivate contempt for the particular case in aesthetic\nconsiderations, by misleadingly modeling a dualistic vision of art\nupon an equally misleading dualistic model of language (Hagberg\n1995). \u201cThe sense of a proposition\u201d, he says, \u201cis\nvery similar to the business of an appreciation of art\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 29). This might also be called a subtractive\nmodel, and Wittgenstein captures this perfectly with a question:\n\u201cA man may sing a song with expression and without\nexpression. Then why not leave out the song\u2014could you have the\nexpression then?\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 32 editorial note and\nfootnote) Such a model corresponds, again, to mind-matter Cartesian\ndualism, which is a conceptual template that also, as we have just\nseen above, manifests itself in the philosophy of language where we\nwould picture the thought as an inner event and the external word or\nsign to which it is arbitrarily attached as that inner event's\noutward corresponding physicalization. It is no surprise that, in this\nlecture, he turns directly to false and imprisoning pictures of this\ndualism in linguistic meaning, and then back to the aesthetic\ncase. When we contemplate the expression of a drawn face, it is deeply\nmisleading\u2014or deeply misled, if the dualistic picture of\nlanguage stands behind this template-conforming thought\u2014to ask\nfor the expression to be given without the face. \u201cThe\nexpression\u201d\u2014now linking this discussion back to the\nprevious causal considerations\u2014\u201cis not an effect\nof the face\u201d. The template of cause-and-effect, and of a dualism\nof material and expressive content (on the subtractive model), and the\nconstrual of the material work of art as a means to the\nproduction of a separately-identifiable intangible, experiential\nend, are all out of place here. All of the examples\nWittgenstein gives throughout these lectures combat these pictures,\neach in their own way.\n\n\nBut then Wittgenstein's examples also work in concert: they\ntogether argue against a form of aesthetic reductionism that would\npretend that our reactions to aesthetic objects are isolable, that they\ncan be isolated as variables within a controlled experiment, that they\ncan be hermetically sealed as the experienced effects of isolatable\ncauses. He discusses our aesthetic reactions to subtle\ndifferences between differently drawn faces, and our equally subtle\nreactions to the height or design of a door (he is known to have had\nthe ceiling in an entire room of the house in Vienna he designed for\nhis sister moved only a few inches when the builders failed to realize\nhis plan with sufficient exactitude). The enormous subtlety, and the\nenormous complexity, of these reactions, are a part of\u2014and as\ncomplicated as\u2014our natural history. He gives as an example the\nerror, or the crudeness, of someone responding to a complaint\nconcerning the depiction of a human smile (specifically, that the smile\ndid not seem genuine), with the reply that, after all, the lips are\nonly parted one one-thousandths of an inch too much: such differences,\nhowever small in measure, in truth matter enormously.\n",
