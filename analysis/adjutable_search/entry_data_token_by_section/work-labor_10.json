    "main_text": "Work and its Future\n5. Conclusion\n\nWork and labor bear intrinsic philosophical interest. But their\ncentrality to the human condition also entail that work and labor\nintersect with still broader philosophical questions about the human\ngood and the just organization of human societies. Ongoing and\nanticipated changes to the world of work should provide rich fodder\nfor philosophical inquiry in coming decades. Philosophy is likely to\nhave a special role to play in addressing what Appiah (2021:7) has\ncalled the \u201chard problem,\u201d to determine \u201chow to\nproduce the goods and services we need, while providing people with\nincome, sociability, and significance.\u201d\n",
