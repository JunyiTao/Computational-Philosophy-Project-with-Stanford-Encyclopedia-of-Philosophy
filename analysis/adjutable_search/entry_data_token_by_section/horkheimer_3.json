    "main_text": "Materialism and The Early Program of the Institute of Social Research || Critiques of Metaphysics and Science\n2.3 Critiques of Metaphysics and Science\n\nOne can get a sense of what Horkheimer means when criticizing\nmetaphysics by looking at \u201cMaterialism and Metaphysics.\u201d\nThere metaphysics is described in relation to Wilhelm Dilthey\u2019s\ndoctrine of \u201cworld views.\u201d For Dilthey, human beings\nengage in metaphysics in an attempt to explain the enigmatic elements\nof human life. In this attempt, certain characteristics of experience\nare emphasized and developed into coherent world views that have\nputatively universal validity, and describe the significance of the\nworld and human life (pp. 10\u201317). So \u201cmetaphysics,\u201d\nin this sense, amounts to a kind of intellectualized, theoretically\nelaborated attempt at turning partial, finite experiences into a\ncomprehensive view of nature and human experience.\n\nFor Horkheimer, theories of this type are in part problematic because\n\u201cknowledge of the infinite must itself be infinite\u201d\n(Horkheimer 1933a, p. 27). But human beings are only capable of finite\nknowledge, and can only pay attention to changing historical\nconditions. If insights into the absolute are impossible, there is no\nknown ultimate order of things that grounds all other forms of\nknowledge. Along these lines Horkheimer criticized Max Scheler\u2019s\nmetaphysical anthropology for holding that all human works and\nachievements could be described in terms of some basic structure of\nhuman nature (Horkheimer 1935b, p. 153). Rather than pursuing an\ninterest in understanding human existence, Horkheimer argues,\nmetaphysics obscures the proper understanding of human life. Many of\nHorkheimer\u2019s early essays aim to show how the works of various\nphilosophers, past and present, are troubled in this way. For example,\nalong with the criticism of Dilthey in \u201cMaterialism and\nMetaphysics\u201d and the criticism of Scheler in \u201cRemarks on\nPhilosophical Anthropology,\u201d there are (among others) critiques\nof this type that attack Kant in \u201cMaterialism and\nMorality,\u201d and Henri Bergson in \u201cOn Bergson\u2019s\nMetaphysics of Time.\u201d\n\nIn each case, however, Horkheimer was not solely critical, and there\nis a positive element that Horkheimer finds in metaphysics that serves\nas a transition to his critique of science. For example, in the 1932\nessay \u201cNotes on Science and the Crisis,\u201d he applauds\n\u201cpostwar metaphysics, especially that of Max Scheler\u201d for\ndeveloping \u201ca method less hindered by conventional narrowness of\noutlook\u201d (p.6). Similarly, in the 1934 essay \u201cThe\nRationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy,\u201d Horkheimer\nagrees with Dilthey and Bergson (and also Nietzsche, all three under\nthe aegis of Lebensphilosophie) insofar as they critique\nscientism and formalistic rationalism. Metaphysics is, in general,\nright to try to engage in some form of synoptic theorizing, although\nit takes it too far. But the opposite extreme, of which Scheler,\nDilthey, and Bergson are critical, fits with Horkheimer\u2019s\nconception of the state of the sciences.\n\nThe critique of the sciences developed in the early texts moves along\ntwo lines. First, the sciences are criticized for being overly\nspecialized. For example, in the inaugural address Horkheimer\ncomplains of \u201cchaotic specialization\u201d (p. 9). The danger\nof focusing on technical minutiae is that researchers become insulated\nfrom one another, and lose the ability to use one another\u2019s\nresources. The result is a lack of unification and overall direction.\nJust as he favors a planned economy, Horkheimer wants the\n\u201csetting of tasks\u201d in scientific research to be brought\nunder rational control, so empirical researchers can work together\ntoward broader ends. Second, as noted in \u201cNotes on Science and\nthe Crisis,\u201d science \u201chas no realistic grasp of that\ncomprehensive relationship upon which its own existence and the\ndirection of its work depends, namely, society\u201d (p. 8). All\nhuman work, be it in the sciences or anything else, depends on a\nbroader context which supports it, and the activities that are\nassociated with the social interests prevalent at any given time\naffect the direction of scientific research. There is no \u201cview\nfrom nowhere\u201d from which empirical research begins, but only\nsocially situated standpoints. Horkheimer expands on this point to\nargue that when empirical research misses its social roots, it also\nmisses the effects the \u201cdirection of its work\u201d might have\non society. Science has a responsibility to society that can only be\nfilled if its various research efforts are knit together within a more\ncomprehensive framework that takes society and its improvement as its\nobject.\n\nThis is largely repeated in other works that criticize\n\u201cpositivism.\u201d The fact that the Frankfurt School mounted a\nstrong critique of positivism is quite well known, in part because of\nthe so-called \u201cPositivismusstreit\u201d of the 1960s,\nand Horkheimer also uses the term frequently, especially in his later\nworks. The critiques of science and positivism make the same basic\n points.[3]\n Consider the critique of logical positivism in the 1937 essay\n\u201cThe Latest Attack on Metaphysics.\u201d There Horkheimer\nargues that insofar as logical empiricism \u201cholds only to what\nis, to the guarantee of facts\u201d (pp. 133\u2013134), it tries to\ninsulate the individual sciences from broader interpretation. Thus\npositivism disconnects science from society and robs it of its\nemancipatory possibilities, because brute facts can only grasp the\npresent, and the possibility for changing the status quo in the future\nis lost.\n\nThe crucial point to note is that the critiques of metaphysics and\nscience work together, and are meant to open up a space between the\ntwo where materialist social research should operate. Philosophy\nmaintains metaphysics\u2019 goal of producing a synoptic view of\nhuman life, but it does so in a merely provisional way, which is open\nto empirical research that genuinely follows the contours of history.\nScience, on the other hand, maintains its rigorous empirical methods,\nbut must open itself up to the role it plays in the broader social\nframework. In the inaugural address, Horkheimer thus claims that there\nmust be a \u201ccontinuous, dialectical penetration and development\nof philosophical theory and specialized scientific practice\u201d (p.\n9).\n",
