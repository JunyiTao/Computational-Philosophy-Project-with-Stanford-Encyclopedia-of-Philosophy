    "main_text": "Political Legitimacy and Democracy || Pure Proceduralist Conceptions of Democratic Legitimacy\n4.2 Pure Proceduralist Conceptions of Democratic Legitimacy\n\nAccording to pure proceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy,\ndemocratic decisions are legitimate as long as they are the result of\nan appropriately constrained process of democratic decision-making.\nThese views place all the normative weight on the democratic\nprocedure.\n\nThere are several ways in which pure proceduralism might be\nunderstood. On an account of aggregative democracy\u2014which takes\nthe aggregation of individual preferences, for example through voting,\nto be the key feature of democracy\u2014pure proceduralism implies\nthat democratic decisions are legitimate if the aggregative process is\nfair. Kenneth May\u2019s defense of majority rule (May 1952) relies\non a view of this sort (see also Dahl 1956).\n\nOn a deliberative account of democracy, legitimacy depends, at least\nin part, on the process of public deliberation (Manin 1987; Bohman\n1996; Gutmann and Thompson 1996). Thomas Christiano has a good\ncharacterization of what pure proceduralism entails in an account of\ndeliberative democracy: \u201cdemocratic discussion, deliberation,\nand decisionmaking under certain conditions are what make the outcomes\nlegitimate for each person. \u2026 [W]hatever the results of\ndiscussions, deliberation, and decisionmaking \u2026, they are\nlegitimate. The results are made legitimate by being the results of\nthe procedure\u201d (Christiano 1996: 35). The idea is that while\ndemocratic deliberation helps sorting through reasons for and against\nparticular candidates or policy proposals, and perhaps even generates\nnew alternatives, the legitimacy of the outcomes of such a process\nonly depends on the fairness of the decision-making process, not on\nthe quality of the outcomes it produces. The justification for\nconceptions of democratic legitimacy of this kind is that there is no\nshared standard for assessing the quality of the outcomes\u2014deep\ndisagreement about reasons for and against proposals will always\nremain. A fair way to resolve such disagreements is thus the only\nsource of the legitimacy of the outcomes (Waldron 1996; Gaus 1997;\nChristiano 2008).\n\nEstlund (2008) has raised a challenge against fairness-based versions\nof democratic proceduralism. He points out that other decision-making\nprocedures\u2014flipping a coin, for example\u2014also satisfy a\nfairness requirement. An argument from fairness is thus insufficient\nto establish the superior legitimacy of democratic decision-making.\nPure proceduralists can respond to this challenge by pointing to the\ndistinctive fairness of democratic decision-making procedures. They\ncan argue that the legitimacy of democratically made decisions stems\nfrom the kind of political equality realized only by democracy.\nAccording to Christiano (2008), only in a democracy are people\npublicly treated as equals. According to Viehoff (2014) and Kolodny\n(2023), only a democracy secures the kind of relational equality that\navoids subordinating some citizens to the decisions of others.\n\nAnother response to Estlund\u2019s challenge against fairness-based\narguments is to focus on the kind of freedom that democracy offers,\nrather than on egalitarian considerations. Pettit\u2019s equal\ncontrol view, already mentioned in sections 1 and 3.3, rests on this\nstrategy. Pettit\u2019s republican theory defends democracy as\nuniquely able to secure the non-domination of the citizens. Lafont\n(2019) defends the legitimacy of democracy on the basis of its link to\nself-governance (see the discussion of her view in section 4.1).\n\nA different proceduralist response to Estlund\u2019s challenge is to\npoint to the procedural epistemic values that the democratic process\nrealizes\u2014on how inclusive it is, for example, or how thoroughly\nthe knowledge claims on which particular proposals rest have been\nsubjected to criticism. The thought is that political legitimacy may\nbe jeopardized not just by unequal access to political, social and\neconomic institutions, but also by unjustified epistemic privilege.\nWhat Peter calls pure epistemic proceduralism is a conception of\ndemocratic legitimacy according to which political decisions are\nlegitimate if they are the outcome of a deliberative democratic\ndecision-making process that satisfies some conditions of political\nand epistemic fairness (Peter 2008).\n",
