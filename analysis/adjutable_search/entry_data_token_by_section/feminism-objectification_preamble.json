    "main_text": "\n\nObjectification is a notion central to feminist theory. It can be\nroughly defined as the seeing and/or treating a person, usually a\nwoman, as an object. In this entry, the focus is primarily on\nsexual objectification, objectification occurring in the sexual realm.\nMartha Nussbaum (1995, 257) has identified seven features that are\ninvolved in the idea of treating a person as an object:\n\ninstrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for\nthe objectifier\u2019s purposes;\ndenial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking\nin autonomy and self-determination;\ninertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in\nagency, and perhaps also in activity;\nfungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable\nwith other objects;\nviolability: the treatment of a person as lacking in\nboundary-integrity;\nownership: the treatment of a person as something that is\nowned by another (can be bought or sold);\ndenial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as\nsomething whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken\ninto account.\n\n\nRae Langton (2009, 228\u2013229) has added three more features to\nNussbaum\u2019s list:\n\nreduction to body: the treatment of a person as\nidentified with their body, or body parts;\nreduction to appearance: the treatment of a person\nprimarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the\nsenses;\nsilencing: the treatment of a person as if they are\nsilent, lacking the capacity to speak.\n\n\nThe majority of the thinkers discussing objectification have taken it\nto be a morally problematic phenomenon. This is particularly the case\nin feminist discussions of pornography. Anti-pornography feminists\nCatharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, influenced by Immanuel\nKant\u2019s conception of objectification, have famously argued that,\ndue to men\u2019s consumption of pornography, women as a group are\nreduced to the status of mere tools for men\u2019s purposes.\nMoreover, feminists like Sandra Bartky and Susan Bordo have argued\nthat women are objectified through being excessively preoccupied with\ntheir appearance. Important recent work by feminists has also been\ndevoted to exploring the connection between objectivity and\nobjectification. More recently, some thinkers, such as Martha\nNussbaum, have challenged the idea that objectification is a\nnecessarily negative phenomenon, arguing for the possibility of\npositive objectification. While treating a person as an object (in one\nor more of the ways mentioned above) is often problematic, Nussbaum\nargues that objectification can in some contexts take benign or even\npositive forms, and can constitute a valuable and enjoyable part of\nour lives. In her forthcoming work, Nancy Bauer questions the very\nidea that it makes sense to specify the marks and features of the term\n\u2018objectification\u2019. Such an attempt, she argues, will only\ndistort the phenomenon in question (2015).\n",
