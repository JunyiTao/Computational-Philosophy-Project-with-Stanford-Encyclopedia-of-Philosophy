Domination and Applied Ethics\n\nBecause power asymmetries persist in other contexts outside the\ntraditionally political, the idea of domination has been marshaled\nbeyond political philosophy in applied ethics. Anti-domination\napproaches have an ecumenical appeal. Few deny that the paradigms are\nexamples of injustice; thus, to show that some power structure or use\nof power resembles these paradigms goes a long way toward motivating a\nverdict against them. Awareness of domination also draws our attention\nto the ways moral wrong can be manifest outside the limits of\nindividual actions. Aside from questions about which individual\nactions are wrong, other questions become important. Who is empowered\nto act in what ways? How are potential victims empowered to resist?\nWho is vulnerable even if not actually victimized? However benevolent,\nwho makes the rules? Who obeys or refuses to obey, and what does their\ncompliance (or refusal) cost them? How do the actions of those with\nmore power construct the space where the less powerful or the\npowerless must act? \n\nMedical care (or the failure to provide it) is rife with potential for\ndomination. The sick are vulnerable to those who control what they\nneed to get well (O\u2019Shea 2017, 2018). The disabled choose and\nact in a world constructed almost entirely for the benefit of and\ncontrolled by others (De Wispelaere & Casassas 2014). Workers\noften have little say in the conditions or culture of their workplaces\n(Gourevitch 2011; Breen 2015; Anderson 2017). Migrant and immigrant\npopulations usually exist in political limbo where they are deeply\nvulnerable to exploitation and have no legal standing to contest their\ntreatment (Honohan 2014; Costa 2016; Sager 2017). The consumption\nhabits of wealthy nations shape a global environment in which all\nhumans now and for the foreseeable future will make their choices\n(Bohman 2011; Nolt 2011; Smith 2012; Smith 2013; Katz 2017).\n\nMost deployment of anti-domination arguments applies neorepublican\ntheories of domination, but there are important exceptions. In\naddition to the departures from neorepublican accounts noted above in\nFriedman\u2019s and Kittay\u2019s work on caregivers and families,\nother attempts to use domination beyond the traditionally political\nhave yielded revisionary results. For example, Tom O\u2019Shea\nworries that the standard neorepublican focus on choice interference,\nand the worsening of an agent\u2019s choice situation, leaves us\nill-equipped to see the possibility for \u201cassistive arbitrary\npower\u201d in medical care. In these cases, the sick may be\nvulnerable to domination not because someone acts intentionally to\ninterfere with their choices\u2014e.g., by raising the price of a\ndrug beyond what they can afford\u2014but by failing to provide a\nbenefit, as when no one will provide transportation to someone with\nimpaired mobility. In a more dramatic departure, Corey Katz argues\nthat the tendency of mainstream neorepublicanism to ground domination\nin social relatedness and the possibility for choice interference\nmakes it unfit to diagnose the domination of those yet to be born\n(2017). If we want to think of intergenerational injustice as a\nvariety of domination, Katz insists, we must shift to an outcome-based\nconception that focuses on unjust harm done to future generations, who\nare unable to resist that harm.\n",
