    "main_text": "John Duns Scotus\n7. John Duns Scotus\n\n\nIt was the Franciscan John Duns Scotus, more than anyone else, who put\nan end to the theory of divine illumination. As Steven Marrone (2001)\nhas shown in detail, there were various authors at the end of the\nthirteenth century who were ready to reject illumination. Indeed, Ghent\nhimself gave illumination less and less attention in his later years.\nStill, it was Scotus who provided the most impressive and extensive\nphilosophical alternative to illumination theory. (As John Boler remarked\nin correspondence, \u201cas with Nixon\u2019s trip to China, it probably\ncould only be done by a Franciscan.\u201d) Scotus criticizes Ghent\u2019s\nargument in detail (Ordinatio I.3.1.4), arguing against\nGhent\u2019s own arguments, against the skeptical consequences that would\nallegedly come from giving up divine illumination, and against the\nviability of such illumination in its own right. With respect to the\nlast point, Scotus argues that if human cognition were fallible in the\nway Ghent argues, then outside illumination could not, even in\nprinciple, ensure \u201ccertain and pure knowledge.\u201d On Ghent\u2019s account, the\nhuman mind cooperates with the divine light in achieving such\nknowledge. Scotus replies: \nWhen one of those that come together is incompatible with\ncertainty, then certainty cannot be achieved. For just as from one\npremise that is necessary and one that is contingent nothing follows\nbut a contingent conclusion, so from something certain and something\nuncertain, coming together in some cognition, no cognition that is\ncertain follows (Ordinatio I.3.1.4 n. 221).\n\n\nIf one part of a system is fallible, then that fallibility infects the\nprocess of a whole. Scotus\u2019s startling claim is that if the human mind\nwere intrinsically incapable of achieving certain knowledge, then not\neven divine illumination could save it. \n\n\nScotus\u2019s own view is that the human mind is capable of such\nknowledge on its own. If by \u201ccertain and pure truth\u201d Ghent means\n\u201cinfallible truth, without doubt and deception,\u201d then Scotus thinks he\nhas established that human beings \u201ccan achieve this, by purely natural\nmeans\u201d (Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 258). How can such a thing be\nestablished? How can the skeptic be refuted, without appealing to\ndivine illumination? Scotus distinguishes four kinds of knowledge:\n\nself-evident (principia per se nota)\ninductive (cognita per experientiam)\nintrospective (cognoscibilia de actibus nostris)\nsensory (ea quae subsunt actibus sensus)\n\n\n\nThe general strategy is to show that sensory knowledge rests on\ninductive knowledge, that inductive knowledge rests on self-evident\nknowledge, and that introspective knowledge can be defended as\nanalogous to self-evident knowledge. Scotus\u2019s implicit aim is to shift\nas much weight as possible onto the broad shoulders of self-evident\nknowledge.\n\n\nFor Scotus, the self-evident is the bedrock on which other sorts of\nknowledge rest, and so he does not attempt to locate some further set of\neven more basic truths. Instead, he argues that our self-evident\nknowledge is foolproof because of certain psychological facts. When one\nconsiders a proposition like Every whole is greater than its\npart, one immediately grasps that the terms are related in such a\nway that the proposition must be true:\nThere can be in the intellect no apprehension of the terms\nor composition of those terms without the conformity of that\ncomposition to the terms emerging (quin stet conformitas),\njust as two white things cannot arise without their likeness emerging\n(Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 230).\n\n\nWhen we see two white objects we immediately grasp, \u201cwithout doubt\nand deception,\u201d their similarity to one another. Likewise, when we\ngrasp a self-evident truth in our mind, we immediately grasp its truth.\nOf course, we won\u2019t grasp the truth of the proposition if we don\u2019t\nunderstand the meaning of the terms, but in that case we won\u2019t have\ntruly formed the proposition in our mind. And in contrast to the\nanalogous case of recognizing similarity, there is no room for sensory\nerror here. The senses help us acquire certain concepts, but once we\nhave those concepts, the senses drop out of the picture \u2014 sensory\nreliability becomes irrelevant. Scotus offers the example of a blind\nman miraculously shown in his dreams an image of black and white. Once\nhe acquires these concepts, he can recognize as truly and infallibly as\nanyone \u2014 his blindness notwithstanding \u2014 that white is not black\n(Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 234).\n\n\nScotus is unwilling to discard Augustinian illumination entirely,\nand so he articulates four senses in which the human intellect sees\ninfallible truths in the divine light. In each sense, the divine light\nacts not on us but on the objects of our understanding. By giving\nobjects their intelligibility (esse intelligibile), the divine\nintellect \u201cis that in virtue of which secondarily the objects produced\nmove the intellect in actuality\u201d (Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 267). When\nthe human mind grasps a self-evident truth, it does so immediately and\ninfallibly not because the mind has received any special illumination,\nbut because the terms of the proposition are themselves intelligible:\nour grasp of a proposition \u201cseems to follow necessarily from the\ncharacter of the terms, which character they derive from the divine\nintellect\u2019s causing those terms to have intelligible being naturally\u201d\n(Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 268). It is not that we are illuminated by the\ndivine light, but that the truth we grasp is illuminated.\n\n\nThis marks a turning point in the history of philosophy, the first\ngreat victory for naturalism as a research strategy in cognitive\ntheory. On Scotus\u2019s account, when we grasp some conceptual truth,\nnothing miraculous or divine happens within us: \u201cthe terms, once\napprehended and put together, are naturally suited (sunt nati\nnaturaliter) to cause an awareness of the composition\u2019s conformity\nwith its terms\u201d (Ord. I.3.1.4 n. 269). It is of course God that\ngives the world its intelligibility, just as it is God that creates our\ncognitive powers. But what is new in Scotus is the idea that the mind is\nnot a special case. From this point forward, divine illumination would\nrarely be regarded as a serious philosophical possibility.\n",
