    "main_text": "Implementation\n5. Implementation\n\nThe word \u2018implementation\u2019 is often associated with a\nphysical realization of a computing system, i.e., to a machine\nexecuting a computer program. In particular, according to the dual\nontology of computing systems examined in\n \u00a71.1,\n implementation in this sense reduces to the structural hardware, as\nopposed to the functional software. By contrast, following the method\nof the levels of abstraction\n (\u00a7 1.2),\n implementation becomes a wider relation holding between any LoA\ndefining a computational system and the levels higher in the\nhierarchy. Accordingly, an algorithm is an implementation of a (set\nof) specification(s); a program expressed in a high level programming\nlanguage can be defined as an implementation of an algorithm (see\n \u00a74);\n assembly and machine code instructions can be seen as an\nimplementation of a set of high-level programming language\ninstructions with respect to a given ISA; finally, executions are\nphysical, observable, implementations of those machine code\ninstructions. By the same token, programs formulated in a high-level\nlanguage are also implementations of specifications, and, as similarly\nargued by the dual-ontology paradigm, executions are implementations\nof high-level programming language instructions. According to Turner\n(2018), even the specification can be understood as an implementation\nof what has been called intention.\n\nWhat remains to be examined here is the nature of the implementation\nrelation thus defined. Analyzing this relation is essential to define\nthe notion of correctness\n (\u00a77).\n Indeed, a correct program amounts to a correct implementation of an\nalgorithm; and a correct computing system is a correct implementation\nof a set of specifications. In other words, under this view, the\nnotion of correctness is paired with that of implementation for any\nLoA: any level can be said to be correct with respect to upper levels\nif and only if it is a correct implementation thereof.\n\nThe following three subsections examine three main definitions of the\nimplementation relation that have been advanced in the philosophy of\ncomputer science literature.\n",
