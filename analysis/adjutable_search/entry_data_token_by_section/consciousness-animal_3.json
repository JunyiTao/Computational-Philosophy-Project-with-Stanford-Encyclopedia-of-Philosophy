Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues\nThe topic of consciousness in nonhuman animals has been primarily\nof epistemological interest to philosophers of mind. Two central\nquestions are:\n\nCan we know which animals beside humans are conscious? (The\nDistribution\n Question)[5]\nCan we know what, if anything, the experiences of animals are like?\n(The Phenomenological Question)\n\n\nIn his seminal paper \u201cWhat is it like to be a bat?\u201d Thomas\nNagel (1974) simply assumes that there is something that it\nis like to be a bat, and focuses his attention on what he argues is\nthe scientifically intractable problem of knowing what it is\nlike. Nagel\u2019s confidence in the existence of conscious bat experiences\nwould generally be held to be the commonsense view and, as the\npreceding section illustrates, a view that is increasingly taken for\ngranted by many scientists too. But, as we shall see, it is subject to\nchallenge and there are those who would argue that the Distribution\nQuestion is just as intractable as the Phenomenological Question.\n",
