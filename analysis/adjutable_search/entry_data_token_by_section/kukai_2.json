    "main_text": "Thought\n3. Thought\n\nK\u016bkai has been regarded as the first comprehensively\nphilosophical thinker in Japanese intellectual history. The influence\nof Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy is noticeable but they are\ninterpreted through the lens of Mantray\u0101na with its emphasis upon\nthe inseparability of ritual practice from theoretical doctrine.\nTraditionally, his thought has been divided into the following\naspects: 1) the theoretical (ky\u014ds\u014d) which\nexplicates the uniqueness and distinction of esoteric Buddhism\n(mikky\u014d) as opposed to exoteric Buddhism\n(kengy\u014d) and demonstrates its validity and\nefficaciousness; and 2) the practical (jis\u014d), which\nprescribes his method of meditation and ritual. Ultimately however the\ntheoretical and the practical are inseparable in K\u016bkai\u2019s\nthought. Within the deep profundity and subtleties of his doctrine,\none recognizes philosophical elements inherited from Madhyamaka,\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra, T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai (Tiantai), and Huayen\n(Huayan) Buddhist thought. But with these are incorporated the\nelements of devotional piety and magico-esoteric practice even in his\ntheoretical writings. What is especially pronounced and distinct in\nhis thought is the significance of bodily experience and practice.\nBuddhist truths for K\u016bkai were not simply meant to be\nintellectually mused over but to be experienced through bodily\npractice. One might say then that for K\u016bkai it is the body\nthat provides the medium whereby theory and practice, doctrine and\nritual, thought and experience, are non-dualistic.\n\nA major contribution made by K\u016bkai for the orthodoxy of Nara\nBuddhism with his systematization of esoteric doctrines, was to bridge\nthe gap between textual study and ritual practice. K\u016bkai\u2019s\nworks provided for the first time a theoretical grounding for the\nincantation of mantras and dh\u0101ran\u012bs and other\nesoteric practices already present in Nara Buddhism. It did this by\nexplicating their relationship to the doctrines expressed in the\nscriptural texts. While esoteric elements were already present in Nara\nBuddhism, their very raison d\u2019etre, other than as forms\nof magic, and their very connection to Buddhist doctrines had been\nleft in the dark. K\u016bkai\u2019s success may be attributable to\nhis ability to provide a sound and intelligible systematic exposition\nof the meanings of the esoteric elements of Buddhism and of the\ninterrelationships between text, ritual, and icon. In doing so it\nsucceeded in bridging the gap between esoteric rituals and scriptural\ndoctrines. (Abe 1999, 11) K\u016bkai had to work out such an\nexposition in order to establish and legitimize the independence and\nrole of his Shingon Buddhism vis-\u00e0-vis the other forms of\nBuddhism already existent in Nara Japan.\n",
