    "main_text": "Religion and the art of ruling || Religion and rulership\n5. Final remarks\n\nPhilosophy and religion turn out to possess a fairly peculiar relation\nto one another in al-Farabi\u2019s thought. Philosophy, or rather\nmetaphysics, is the only way to advance to the most profound\nexplanation of all there is as well as humanity\u2019s natural duties\nentailed by the natural givens. Accordingly, an excellent philosopher\ncan do without religion in her pursuit of happiness. Religion,\nhowever, cannot do without philosophy and, a fortiori,\nneither can society. In view of what is at stake in the case of\nfailure to grasp and convey the truth, the pressure put on philosophy\nand, to some lesser extent, on religion in this theory is enormous.\nSociety cannot fulfill its ergon without either philosophy or\nreligion, nor without a government conscientiously imparting the\ntheoretical and practical duties; with the consequence that, apart\nfrom a few \u2018born\u2019 philosophers, human beings will fail to\nattain individual felicity.\n\nWhile these are serious threats on the practical level, it appears\nthat as far as the underlying anthropology is concerned, al-Farabi\nendorses a profoundly optimistic view. He is convinced that everything\nwhich needs to be known and done to reach individual happiness is\nattainable by virtue of humanity\u2019s natural endowments. As such,\nthere is no need for revelation of a supernatural kind. Instead, as\nal-Farabi gives to understand, there is plenty of evidence to be found\nin reality and its principles, which teach humanity about happiness.\nThere are, furthermore, abundant models, ranging from the cosmic order\nto the makeup of the most primitive organisms, which need only be\nemulated to guide humanity towards its final goal. And, last but not\nleast, there are philosophers who discovered and understood these\nnatural givens and implications already centuries\n ago.[37]\n Hence, the only thing that remains to be done, on his account, is to\nput these insights into practice.\n",
