The sun can nourish and illuminate, but it can also parch and\ndessicate and burn. What I convey about a person by metaphorically\nlikening her to the sun depends on which forms of solar power come to\nmind when I do so, and that in turn depends in an intricate manner on\nthe concrete conversational setting in which I do so. Metaphors\nexhibit a profound and conspicuous context-sensitivity, and\nmuch of the work done on metaphor over the past few years has been\ninformed by more general debates about the proper treatment of\ncontext-sensitivity in systematic philosophy of language.\n\nFor the literalist, the primary verbal expressers of\npropositions, the fundamental verbal bearers of truth-values, are\nsuitably disambiguated sentence types. Hence the primary\nbearers of referents, extensions, and truth-conditional\ncontents, the fundamental units of account in compositional\nsemantics, are suitably disambiguated word and phrase types.\nIt is easy to see what this comes to in the case of artificial\nlanguages suitable to pure mathematics and kindred abstract subject\nmatters. It is harder to see what it comes to in the case of natural\nlanguages, where a single sentence type may be used to assert many\ndifferent propositions with every outward show of candor and\ndirectness in as many different concrete conversational settings. The\nliteralist hopes to take the context-sensitivity of indexicals like\nI and here and now as a model for\nunderstanding semantic context-sensitivity more generally.\n\nHere an independently plausible conception of conversational exchange\ncomes to her aid. The utterances of speakers and the interpretive\nactivity of listeners is profoundly and pervasively shaped by the\ncurrent values of a small number of basic situating\nparameters. These parameters have fairly determinate values at\neach stage in a well-run conversation; a wide variety of\nconversational proprieties and improprieties turn on their current\nvalues at any given stage; the values change from utterance to\nutterance in response to publicly discernible events in a manner\ngoverned by simple principles of conversational dynamics, so that\ncareful and well-situated participants have a fighting chance of\nkeeping track of their changing values. Participants need\nthat fighting chance, since fluent unconstrained conversational\nexchange resulting in full understanding by each of what all the\nothers are saying requires the participants to possess more or less\naccurate, more or less thoroughgoing mutual knowledge of the values of\nthe parameters at each and every point in the exchange.\n\nThe single most obvious and pervasively important situating parameter\nis what is (pragmatically) presupposed, the\nset of propositions whose truth is mutually assumed for current\nconversational purposes. Yet it is easy to make a case for regarding\nwho is speaking, who is being addressed, the time of speaking,\nrelations of relative salience, etc, as additional situating\nparameters. In fact, the parameters to which the contents of various\nspecial \u201ccontext-sensitive\u201d words and phrases are\nmost obviously sensitive appear to be among the situating parameters\nmutual knowledge of which is essential to unconstrained conversational\ncoordination more generally. So perhaps we should think of\nsentence types as expressing propositions, and of word and phrase\ntypes as expressing propositional constituents or contents,\nrelative to one or another assignment of values to the various\nsituating parameters that govern ongoing conversational exchange,\nwhich will then proceed more or less as follows:\n\n\n(a) The content accruing to a sentence (type) when it is uttered, the\ncontent it has relative to the currently active values of the\npertinent situating parameters, serves to determine what can be said\nor otherwise directly communicated by uttering it.\n\n(b) What is said or otherwise directly communicated by an utterance,\ntogether with various other publicly accessible changes in\nconversational circumstances, serve to determine how situating\nparameters change in preparation for the next utterance somebody might\nmake.\n\n(c) When the values situating parameters take on in preparation for\nthe next utterance are fully appropriate as they stand to the\ninterpretation of the next utterance when it comes, the content taken\non by this utterance when it comes is the content the uttered sentence\npossesses relative to those preset parameter values.\n\n(d) When the values the parameters take on in preparation for the next\nutterance are inappropriate as they stand to the next\nutterance when it comes, but there is a unique simple, feasible,\npublicly guessable change in those values that would render the\nutterance appropriate and appropriately interpretable, that change\noccurs forthwith, and the content taken on by the next utterance when\nit comes is the one the uttered sentence possesses relative to the\nfreshly minted set of parameter values resulting from this last-minute\nadjustment. The literature calls this process\naccommodation.\n\n\nFor purposes of semantic and pragmatic theorizing, we can represent\nthe contexts to which the contents of context-sensitive\nexpressions are sensitive and in relation to which they vary by\nsets of possible values for the situating parameters. And we\ncan represent the meaning of a given suitably disambiguated word or\nphrase type by a rule for arriving at an appropriate propositional\nconstituent or truth-conditional contribution or content,\ngiven a context thus understood. David Kaplan called such a\nrule taking us from contexts to contents a character. The\ntechnical resources employed by literalism were put in place gradually\nover the years by Richard Montague (1974), David Kaplan (1989), David\nLewis (1979), and Robert Stalnaker (1999), but whether any of them\nwould fully endorse it is open to question. Prominent literalists\ninclude Kent Bach (2005), Jason Stanley (2007), and the self-styled\nsemantic minimalists: Emma Borg (2004) and Herman Cappelen and Ernie\nLepore (2005).\n\nThe contextualist, by contrast, insists that what it would\ntake for an utterance to be true or instead false, what it would take\nfor an uttered sentence type to be true or instead false\nas uttered, is a matter of what it would take for us to be\nspeaking truly or instead falsely in producing the utterance. When I\nemploy my words with every outward show of candor and directness,\nthere simply isn\u2019t room for a principled and explanatory\ndistinction between what I say and what I mean, the proposition I\nexpress and the proposition I communicate. As a general rule, the\nproposition I express in speaking as I do is what you\u2019d be\naffirming if you responded with Yes, that\u2019s so; what\nyou\u2019d be denying if you responded with No, that\u2019s not\nso; what you\u2019d be questioning if you responded with Is\nthat so? Where there is a disparity between what is said\nand what is successfully meant in either direction, the disparity\nneeds to be pretheoretically discernible at least in broad outline, or\nGricean conversational inferences won\u2019t get off the ground in\nthe first place.\n\nGrant me this much, the contextualist continues, and you\u2019ll need\nto conclude that there\u2019s no assignable limit to the number of\ncontents a term with a given literal meaning can assume, no assignable\nlimit to the features of an occasion of use that can become pertinent\nto determining which of these contents the term actually will assume\non some particular occasion of use, given its literal meaning.\nContexts resist summary representation in terms of sets of situating\nparameter values, and the passage from literal meaning to appropriate\ncontent, given a context, can\u2019t be encapsulated in any tidy\nparametric rule; it is hermeneutic rather than algorithmic in nature.\nAs Charles Travis puts it:\n\nTake any open sentence you like, with any number of supposed places in\nit, each to be filled with reference to a given sort of thing. Take\nany sequence of things, each fit for reference in its corresponding\nplace. Then what the open sentence means is compatible with its saying\nany of indefinitely many things [about] those things, so referred to\nin some closing of it. For example, there is indefinite variety in the\nthings to be said in saying someone to be home at a time. (Are you at\nhome when your house, you in it, has just slid down the hill?) (Travis\n2008, 2).\n\n\nThe contextualist concludes that there is nothing compact and\nsurveyable, relative to which natural language sentence types\ncan be said to express determinate propositions. Indeed, sentence\ntypes as such don\u2019t express propositions or possess\ntruth conditions at all. What truth and falsity and propositional\ncontent accrue to first and foremost are speakings to particular\ncommunicative effect on the part of particular speakers. \u201cOnly\nin the context of a speech act does a sentence express a determinate\ncontent\u201d(Recanati, 2004). Prominent contextualists include\nTravis (2008), John Searle (1979a), Fran\u00e7ois Recanati (2004),\nHerbert Clark (1992), Stephen Levinson (2000), and latter-day\nrelevance theorists: Robyn Carston (2002), Anne Bezuidenhout (2002),\nand Sperber and Wilson themselves in work from the mid-90s on.\n\nConfronted with puzzles like Travis\u2019s about what it takes to be\nliterally \u201cat home,\u201d the literalist needs to\nmaintain that the proposition I succeed in communicating by uttering a\nsentence often differs from the one my sentence expresses relative to\nprevailing values for relevant situating parameters, even when I speak\nwith every surface sign of candor and directness. She concludes from\nthis that there are disparities between what we strictly speaking\nsay, the propositions we verbally express, and what we\nsuccessfully mean that are subtler than those exhibited in\nclassical Gricean implicatures. She hopes the discriminatory and\nexplanatory strategies Grice brought to bear on relatively gross\ndisparities between the said and the meant can eventually be brought\nto bear on these subtler ones as well.\n\nThe contextualist is free to think of at least some figurative uses as\nturning on a contrast between the literal content accruing to\nan expression directly and from below (in virtue of its meaning and\nrelevant features of its occasion of use) and a distinct, derived,\nfigurative content the expression passes on up the tree of\ngrammar as its contribution to the content of any larger syntactic\nwholes in which it may be embedded. In other words, he is free to\nregard at least some figures of speech as involving pragmatically\ninspired processes of content reassignment.\n\nFor the literalist, however, all possible contents for a given\nexpression issue from some appropriate underlying literal meaning for\nit in fundamentally the same way and with fundamentally the same\ndirectness: we simply apply one and the same content-determining\nrule, one and the same character, to different\ncontexts. Literalism therefore has no place for figurative\ncontents (so understood) in its accounts of figurative\nlanguage use.\n\nRecent contextualist accounts of metaphor have tended to be exercises\nin \u201ctruth conditional pragmatics\u201d: metaphor involves some\ncombination of enrichment and loosening in the applicability\nconditions of pertinent general terms, where the resulting content\nshift is just drastic enough to bring what the speaker is thereby\ntaken to be saying and what she is thereby taken to mean or\nimplicate into accord with pertinent conversational norms. The\nconceptual raw materials for the shifted content derive in part from\nwhat is taken for granted at a given point in a given conversation, in\npart from commonplaces belonging to \u201cencyclopedia entries\u201d\npermanently associated with particular terms for all competent users\nof those terms. In relevance theoretic accounts\u2014Carston (2002),\nBezuidenhout (2001), Sperber and Wilson (2008)\u2014the adjustment is\npart of the same reflectively accessible process of conversational\ninference we use to work out classical Gricean implicatures. In\nRecanati\u2019s competing account (2004), it is managed by\n\u201cassociative\u201d processes to which the listener lacks\nroutine reflective access. Sperber and Wilson maintain that metaphor\nis just an especially dramatic instance of processes of content\nmodulation at work throughout the interpretation of language,\ninvolving no distinctive principles of its own.\n\nRecent literalist accounts of metaphor have come in two styles.\n\nOn the one hand, there are efforts to portray the context sensitivity\nof metaphor in terms of Kaplanian characters: rules that render the\nsemantic content of a suitable specific metaphorical constituent a\nsuitable function of the current value of some specific situating\nparameter of special relevance to metaphor in particular.\n\nWhen employed within the scope of modal and counterfactual\nconstructions, a metaphorical focal expression brings the properties\nit actually picks out here and now to the characterization of\ncircumstances in which it would have picked out other properties, had\nit been employed in them. This encourages Josef Stern (2000) to posit\na term-taking, term-making operator, \u201cmetaphorically\nspeaking\u201d or \u201cmthat,\u201d ordinarily left unpronounced,\nwhose behavior is modeled on that of Kaplan\u2019s rigidifying\noperator \u201cdthat.\u201d Stern supposes that at any given point\nin any given conversation, there is a set of things mutually taken for\ngranted for various figure-interpreting purposes; he calls them\nI-presuppositions. (Think back to Skulsky\u2019s\ntalk-postulates.) Like ordinary presuppositions, I-presuppositions\nchange from utterance to utterance under the impact of accommodation\npressures, and they equip terms with \u201cimplications\u201d in\nsomething like Skulsky\u2019s sense: a property P is\n\u201cimplied by\u201d or m-associated with a general term\n\u03a6 in context c just in case it is I-presupposed in that\ncontext that things to which \u03a6 applies have property P.\nThe full Kaplanian account of \u201cmthat\u201d runs more or less as\nfollows:\n\nIf \u03a6 is a general term, then for a given context c,\n\u201cmthat [\u03a6]\u201d has as its content the conjunction of all\nthe properties that are m-associated with \u03a6 in context c;\nfor that context c, it picks out this conjunction of\nproperties in any circumstance s. (115)\n\n\nThis makes the content of \u201cmthat [\u03a6]\u201d a function of a\nspecial purpose situating parameter, the set of active\nI-presuppositions, even in cases where \u03a6 itself has\nthe same content in every context.\n\nOn the other hand, there are efforts to rehabilitate the classical\nGricean implicature account of metaphor by challenging the specific\ndiagnostics for \u2018what is said\u2019 insisted upon by\ncontemporary contextualists. Neo-Gricean literalists undertake to\nargue that what is meant can differ from what is said even\nwhen speakers speak with every outward show of candor and directness,\nand that this is precisely what happens when speakers resort to\nmetaphor. The arguments they employ against their contextualist\nopponents bear a striking resemblance to those Kripke employed against\nDonnellan\u2019s content-based treatment of the distinction\nbetween referential and attributive uses of definite\ndescriptions. See Donnellan (1966), Kripke (1977), and the entry on\n descriptions.\n\nAn especially detailed effort along these lines comes from Elisabeth\nCamp (2006); only one of her arguments can be reviewed here. Some time\nback the linguist Larry Horn drew attention to \u201cthe phenomenon\nof metalinguistic negation\u2014a device for\nobjecting to a previous utterance on any grounds whatever, including\nthe conventional or conversational implicata it potentially induces,\nits morphology, its style or register, or its phonetic\nrealization\u201d (Horn, 1988, 381). Consider \u201cIt wasn\u2019t\nwarm, it was sweltering,\u201d where of course, if\nit was sweltering, it follows that it was warm as well. In\nmany circumstances, a form of words the contextualist regards as\nreserved for denying what is said can in fact be pressed into service\nto deny one or another associated, unexpressed proposition. Camp\ncontends that this renders direct denial diagnostics for what is said\nsystematically unreliable. If she\u2019s right about this, direct\naffirmation diagnostics and direct questioning diagnostics will be in\ntrouble for the same sort of reason.\n",
