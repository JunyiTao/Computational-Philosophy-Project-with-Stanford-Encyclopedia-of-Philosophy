    "main_text": "Medieval Empiricism || The Eclipse of Divine Illumination\n4.2 The Eclipse of Divine Illumination\n\nI have already noted a certain ambivalence among medievals writers\nregarding what I have called genetic empiricism, insofar as they\ncombine the idea of a \u2018blank slate\u2019 with that of an innate\ncapacity of the mind to form ideas. Some medievals, as we saw, went\nfurther, holding that the mind was incapable of attaining scientific\nknowledge without a divine illumination. It is time to look more\nclosely at this idea of divine illumination: the reasons why it was\nheld and its gradual decline.\n\nFollowers of St Augustine shared Plato\u2019s doubts about the\ncapacity of sense perception, in particular about its ability to give\nrise to scientific knowledge. Such knowledge, they held, did not arise\nfrom sense perception alone; it required a further input, provided by\nGod himself: a divine illumination. This can be a difficult idea for a\nmodern reader to grasp, since it is easily confused with another\nbelief, which has to do with a supernatural source of knowledge\naccessed by faith. The two are analogous, insofar as they both involve\na divine initiative. The act of faith requires a divine initiative\n\u201con the volitional side,\u201d to enable us to accept\npropositions as divinely revealed. The doctrine of divine illumination\nalso speaks of a divine initiative, but that initiative is directly\ncognitive rather than volitional (Pasnau 2015: sect. 1). It holds that\ndivine illumination is required for a number of apparently ordinary\ncognitive activities, which are engaged in by believers and\nnon-believers alike.\n\nWhile this doctrine has theological roots, it was also motivated by\ntwo features of human knowledge. The first has to do with those\nprinciples of thought that appear to be necessarily, not contingently,\ntrue. These include mathematical truths and principles such as that of\nnon-contradiction or sufficient reason. While such principles are\nessential to thought, it is difficult to see how they could be derived\nfrom sense perception. (Aristotle had provided an empiricist account\nof the origin of mathematical ideas\n [sect. 3.2],\n but this was, and remains, contested.) A second motivation was\nrelated to the Aristotelian ideal of science. Scientific understanding\n(epist\u0113m\u0113, or scientia), as we have seen,\ninvolved a grasp of the essential properties of perceived objects. But\nthis, too, involves a kind of insight that can seem to lie beyond the\ncapacity of the senses\n (sect. 3.2).\n Advocates of divine illumination argued that these kinds of knowledge\nwere possible only because the human mind has access to the mind of\nGod. More precisely, it was possible only because God bathed the human\nmind in his own, uncreated light. This allowed it not only to grasp\nnecessary truths, but to understand the essences of created beings by\nreference to their exemplars in the divine mind.\n\nThe development of medieval empiricism involved a rejection of this\ndoctrine. It is already opposed by Aquinas, who holds that that the\nhuman mind requires a special divine illumination only for those\nmatters that entirely exceed its natural powers, which are known by\ndivine revelation (Aquinas ST 1a 2ae 109.1). But the most\nvigorous rejection of the doctrine is to be found in the work of Duns\nScotus, who opposes the (modified) illuminationist teaching found in\nthe work of Henry of Ghent (ca. 1217\u20131293).\n\nHenry\u2019s version of the illuminationist doctrine was already\ninfluenced by Aristotelian thought (Marrone 1985: 145; 2011: 24),\nwhich in this context took the form of a desire to attribute as much\nas possible to the power of the human mind. But Henry was reluctant to\nattribute all we know to our unaided powers. In particular, he made a\ndistinction between knowing what is true (id quod verum est)\nabout an object and knowing its truth (eius veritatem). The\nfirst is a very basic level of knowledge, existing even in non-human\nanimals. It does grasp its object as a something distinct from the\nknower, but fails to grasp its essential characteristics. Such\nknowledge is not sufficient for science, which requires a grasp of\nwhat the object truly is (quid sit in rei veritate) (Henry of\nGhent Summa 1.2). The latter kind of knowledge requires\naccess to the exemplar of the object in the divine mind, something\nonly God can give.\n\nIt is this idea that Duns Scotus opposes. He would not, of course,\nhave opposed the idea that the human mind was created by God and thus\nowes all its powers to God. (Scotus was, after all, a theologian.) But\nhe did deny that scientific knowledge involved a special divine\nillumination. His argument proceeds in two stages. He insists, first\nof all, that Henry\u2019s restrictions on the powers of the human\nmind, rather than leading to scientific certainty, lead inevitably to\nscepticism. If the human mind is naturally incapable of grasping these\ntruths, then no amount of divine light will help it. He then argues\nthat there are four kinds of naturally attainable knowledge that give\nrise to the certainty required for science. There is, first of all,\nknowledge of \u201cmatters knowable in an unqualified sense,\u201d\nsuch as the fact that a triangle has three angles equal to two right\nangles. The second is knowledge of \u201cmatters knowable through\nexperience,\u201d such as that the moon is eclipsed. The third is\nknowledge of \u201cour own actions,\u201d such as the fact that I am\nawake. The fourth is knowledge of \u201cmatters we are currently\naware of through the senses,\u201d such as that the object in front\nof me is white (Scotus Ord. I dist. 3, pars 1, qu. 4,\nadnot.).\n\nPerhaps the most critical of these is knowledge through experience,\nfor it relates to the way we grasp the principles of scientific\nexplanation. Scotus\u2019s suggestion is that we can know these\nprinciples through repeated exposure to particular instances. As he\nwrites,\n\n\neven though a person does not experience every single individual, but\nonly a great many, nor does he experience them at all times, but only\nfrequently, still be knows infallibly that it is always this way and\nholds for all instances. He knows this in virtue of this proposition\nreposing in his soul: \u201cWhatever occurs in a great many instances\nby a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that\ncause.\u201d (Scotus Ord. I dist. 3, pars 1, qu. 4)\n\n\nScotus seems to regard this proposition as self-evidently true. But as\nNicholas of Autrecourt would point out, it merely begs the question\n(Thijssen 1987: 249). In any case, Nicholas writes, if Scotus means by\na cause \u201cthat which brought an effect in a great many instances\nin the past and will do so in the future,\u201d then there is a\nproblem. For \u201ceven if something has brought about an effect in a\ngreat many instances, it is still not certain it will continue to do\nso\u201d (EO p. 237; Thijssen 1987: 249 n. 44). So we\ncannot, with certainty, form general statements on the basis of the\nkind of observations to which Scotus appeals. (This is, of course, the\nvery problem of induction to which Sextus Empiricus had referred\n [sect. 3.3.4].)\n Even if we could formulate such general statements, we could not be\ncertain that they embody causal claims. It is true that at least one\ncontemporary, John Buridan, would weaken the traditional Aristotelian\nidea that a scientific explanation should make its conclusion\nnecessary (Grant 2010: 237). But the issue Nicholas raised would\nremain a challenge to even Buridan\u2019s more relaxed ideal of\nscientific knowledge.\n\nWe shall come back to this question\n (sect. 4.3),\n which was made more pressing by the nominalism of Scotus\u2019s\nsuccessor, William of Ockham. But even if Scotus had no satisfactory\nalternative to the doctrine of divine illumination, that doctrine was\nsoon eclipsed. By the mid-fourteenth century, it seems to have been no\nlonger considered a viable option. While the idea did not entirely\ndisappear\u2014it re-emerges, for instance, in the work of Nicolas\nMalebranche (1638\u20131715)\u2014its rejection by late medieval\nthinkers marked an important step on the road to a more thorough-going\nempiricism.\n",
