    "main_text": "Microbes as Models || Limits of microbial models?\n4.2 Limits of microbial models?\n\nEven if philosophers concede that microbes might be good models for\nsome very basic biological processes (e.g., genetic pathways), they\nmight still believe that many phenomena of relevance to humans and\nother animals are too far from any microbial analogue. Because of\ninitially being defined by animal characteristics, phenomena such as\npredation, ageing, and kin recognition have often been thought to be\noutside the purview of microbes. However, it turns out that microbes\nare, in fact, productive objects of study for many of these\nphenomena.\n\nPredation, for example, is commonly thought of as a process that\ninvolves one animal killing and consuming another. Nibbling on plants\ncounts only as herbivory, and bacteria consuming other microbes used\nto be considered parasitic or perhaps even herbivorous, depending on\nwhether their \u201cprey\u201d photosynthesized (Guerrero et al.\n1986). Early discoveries of explicitly predatory behavior in bacteria\nannounced them as \u201cthe first parasitic organism that attacks\n[other] bacteria in a recognizably predatory fashion\u201d, despite\nbeing smaller than their prey (Stolp & Starr 1963: 242). Nowadays,\na large range of predatory behaviors are acknowledged in bacteria as\nmore is discovered about microbial diversity in behavior and feeding\nmode (P\u00e9rez et al. 2016). These discoveries have broadened the\ncategory of predation, and provide means by which to investigate the\ngeneral phenomenon of predation and its ecological impact. For many\nresearch purposes, bacterial predators and prey function as models for\nmore general relationships of this sort, and can even show the\nlimitations of current theory (e.g., Gause\u2019s experience with his\neukaryotic microbes).\n\nPhenomena such as ageing were also believed to apply only to\nmulticellular organisms. Bacteria and other unicellular life were\nthought of as ageless and \u201cimmortal\u201d, due to symmetrical\ncell division leading to new offspring replacing the progenitor cell\nand removing any opportunity for ageing (Nystr\u00f6m 2002). Because\nageing used to be defined as something that happened to organisms with\ndistinctions between germ and soma, it was assumed that\n\u201cunicellular bacteria are clearly not members of the exclusive\nclub of aging creatures\u201d (Nystr\u00f6m 2002: 596). However, a\nlarge body of research now investigates just how bacteria age, the\ndifferences between death and ageing, and what bacterial death means\nfor the very evolution of senescence (Baig et al. 2014). In other\nwords, bacterial ageing can model the core phenomena of what it means\nto grow old.\n\nLikewise, kin recognition was once defined on the basis of sensory\ncapacities that are not normally imputed to bacteria and other\nmicrobes (e.g., Hepper 1986). But kin recognition on the basis of\nchemical \u201csensing\u201d is now a well-known phenomenon in\nmicroorganisms, and has broadened what is known about the process in\ngeneral. In bacteria, recognition mechanisms are biochemical and have\nmolecular underpinnings, which means the process can be analyzed and broken down to its components relatively straightforwardly. In animals, inferences about recognition mechanisms are broader and less defined, due to\nthe behavioral level at which kin recognition must be investigated\n(Wall 2016). Protist kin recognition researchers argue that the\nphenomena, origins and evolution of kin recognition in eukaryotes is\nbest studied in diverse unicellular eukaryotic microbes (e.g.,\nPaz-y-Mi\u00f1o-C & Espinosa 2016). Nobody is saying that\nmicrobes directly represent the complex phenomena going on in\nanimals. Bacterial models of kin recognition in general are indirect\nand simplified representations of more complex processes of perception\nin other domains of life (Wall 2016). However, it is well established\nin philosophy that this sort of indirect representation is key to the\nvery practice of modelling (e.g., Weisberg 2013).\n\nSceptics might think there must surely be phenomena in complex\nanimals, such as humans, that resist such modelling. They might\nsuggest that cognitive activities are something that simply cannot be\nmodelled by microbes of any kind because there is no basic analogue\nwith which to work. But even for cognition, unicellular organisms have\nbeen extensively studied for decision optimization, efficiency\ncalculations, memory, anticipation and self-awareness (Westerhoff et\nal. 2014; Beekman & Latty 2015). Not only do these microbes\n(eukaryotic and prokaryotic) undergo direct examination for their own\ncognitive capacities, but they also stand in for the more complex and\nhard-to-access capacities of organisms such as animals. Again, the\nclaim here is not that microbes\u2019 cognitive capacities are the\nsame as those of animals. The claim is that microbes have capacities\nthat include key aspects of cognition, and these capacities can be\nstudied as analogues for cognition in general (including cognition in\nanimals). Just as for kin recognition, the quest to understand the\nunderlying foundations of cognition makes microorganisms such as slime\nmoulds and E. coli valuable models for cognitive capacities\nof a general kind that are not dependent on brains (Beekman &\nLatty 2015; Allen 2017). Whether this is best discussed as minimal\ncognition (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2016; see Lyon forthcoming for\ncriticism) or as another facet of a general capacity that is diversely\ndistributed across the tree of life (e.g., Allen 2017) is irrelevant\nhere: the point is simply that an examination of microbial research\ncan challenge, enrich and potentially reform how philosophers think\nabout classic subjects. Indeed, some new research in microbiology, which we turn to in Section 5, even\nclaims that microbes in the human body are influencing the mind.\n",
