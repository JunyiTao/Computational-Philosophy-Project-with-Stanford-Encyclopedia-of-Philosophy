    "main_text": "Objections to Fictionalism and Responses || Similarity to Fiction\n2.4 Similarity to Fiction\n\nA few people\u2014e.g., Katz (1998), Thomas (2000 and 2002), Hoffman\n(2004), Burgess (2004), and Thomasson (2013)\u2014have objected to\nfictionalism on the grounds that there are obvious disanalogies\nbetween mathematics and fiction. (What exactly the disanalogies are\ndiffers in different versions of the objection. E.g., Katz argues that\nconsistency is an important criterion for goodness in mathematics but\nnot in fiction. And Burgess argues that the question of whether\nmathematical objects exist is not empirically meaningful, whereas the\nquestion of whether the (non-abstract) objects in our fictional\nstories exist is empirically meaningful.)\n\nOne way that fictionalists can respond to this objection is to claim\nthat it\u2019s simply irrelevant because fictionalism does not\ninvolve the claim that there are no important disanalogies between\nmathematics and fiction. As it was defined above, fictionalism is the\nview that (a) our mathematical sentences and theories do purport to be\nabout abstract mathematical objects, as platonism suggests, but (b)\nthere are no such things as abstract objects, and so (c) our\nmathematical theories are not true. There is no claim about fictional\ndiscourse at all here, and so fictionalists can simply deny that their\nview entails that there are no important disanalogies between\nmathematics and fiction.\n\nNow, this does not mean that fictionalists can\u2019t claim that\nthere are some relevant analogies between mathematics and fiction.\nThey can of course claim that there are; e.g., they might\nwant to say that, as is the case in mathematics, there are no such\nthings as fictional objects and, because of this, typical fictional\nsentences are not literally true. But by making such claims,\nfictionalists do not commit themselves to any stronger claims about\nthe analogy between mathematics and fiction\u2014e.g., that\nmathematical discourse is a kind of fictional discourse\u2014and they\ncertainly don\u2019t commit themselves to the claim that there are no\nimportant disanalogies between the two enterprises. In short,\nfictionalism is perfectly consistent with the claim that there are\nnumerous important disanalogies between mathematics and fiction.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are some fictionalists\nwho do seem to want to make some stronger claims about the analogy\nbetween mathematics and fiction. Such people might have to take\nobjections of the above kind more seriously. But none of the\nfictionalists discussed in this essay endorses any very strong claims\nof this kind; in particular, none of them says anything that entails\nthat there are no important disanalogies between mathematics and\nfiction. On the other hand, it should be noted that Yablo and Bueno\nhave made some claims in this connection that go beyond what\nfictionalists need to say. For instance, Bueno (2009) says that\nmathematical objects are similar to fictional characters in that they\nare abstract artifacts (in saying this, he follows\nThomasson\u2019s (1999) view of fictional characters). And Yablo has\nmade some relatively strong claims about an analogy that he thinks\nholds between mathematical utterances and metaphorical\nutterances, or figurative utterances. Thus, Yablo\u2019s particular\nversion of fictionalism is open to objections to the effect that\nmathematical utterances are in fact not similar or analogous\nto metaphorical utterances. Some objections of this kind have been\nraised by Stanley (2001), and Yablo responds to them in his (2002a).\nBut since Yablo doesn\u2019t claim that mathematical utterances are\nanalogous to fictional utterances, he does not have to\nrespond to objections of the kind mentioned at the start of the\npresent subsection.\n",
