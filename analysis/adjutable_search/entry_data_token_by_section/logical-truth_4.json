    "main_text": "The Mathematical Characterization of Logical Truth || Model-theoretic Validity\n2.3 Model-theoretic Validity\n\nEven on the most cautious way of understanding the modality present in\nlogical truths, a sentence is a logical truth only if no sentence\nwhich is a replacement instance of its logical form is false. (This\nidea is only rejected by those who reject the notion of logical form.)\nIt is a common observation that this property, even if it is\nnecessary, is not clearly sufficient for a sentence to be a logical\ntruth. Perhaps there is a sentence that has this property but is not\nreally logically true, because one could assign some unexpressed\nmeanings to the variables and the schematic letters in its\nlogical form, and under those meanings the form would be a false\n sentence.[8]\n On the other hand, it is not clearly incorrect to think that a\nsentence is a logical truth if no collective assignment of meanings to\nthe variables and the schematic letters in its logical form would turn\nthis form into a false sentence. Say that a sentence is\nuniversally valid when it has this property. A standard\napproach to the mathematical characterization of logical truth,\nalternative to the derivability approach, uses always some version of\nthe property of universal validity, proposing it in each case as both\nnecessary and sufficient for logical truth. Note that if a sentence is\nuniversally valid then, even if it's not logically true, it will be\ntrue. So all universally valid sentences are correct at least\nin this sense.\n\nApparently, the first to use a version of universal validity and\nexplicitly propose it as both necessary and sufficient for logical\ntruth was Bolzano (see Bolzano 1837, \u00a7148; and Coffa 1991, pp.\n33\u20134 for the claim of priority). The idea is also present in\nother mathematicians of the nineteenth century (see e.g. Jan\u00e9\n2006), and was common in Hilbert's school. Tarski (1936a, 1936b) was\nthe first to indicate in a fully explicit way how the version of\nuniversal validity used by the mathematicians could itself be given a\ncharacterization in terms of concepts of standard mathematics, in the\ncase of Fregean formalized languages with an algorithmic grammar.\nEssentially Tarski's characterization is widely used today in the form\nof what is known as the model-theoretic notion of validity,\nand it seems fair to say that it is usually accepted that this notion\ngives a reasonably good delineation of the set of logical truths for\nFregean languages.\n\nThe notion of model-theoretic validity mimics the notion of universal\nvalidity, but is defined just with the help of the set-theoretic\napparatus developed by Tarski (1935) for the characterization of\nsemantic concepts such as satisfaction, definability, and truth. (See\nthe entry on\n Tarski's truth definitions.)\n Given a Fregean language, a structure for the language is a\nset-theoretical object composed of a set-domain taken together with an\nassignment of extensions drawn from that domain to its non-logical\nconstants. A structure is meant by most logicians to represent an\nassignment of meanings: its domain gives the range or\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of the first-order variables (and induces ranges\nof the higher-order variables), and the extensions that the structure\nassigns to the non-logical constants are \u201cmeanings\u201d that\nthese expressions could take. Using the Tarskian apparatus, one\ndefines for the formulae of the Fregean language the notion of truth\nin (or satisfaction by) a set-theoretic structure (with respect to an\ninfinite sequence assigning an object of the domain to each variable).\nAnd finally, one defines a formula to be model-theoretically valid\njust in case it is true in all structures for its language (with\nrespect to all infinite sequences). Let's abbreviate \u201c\\(F\\) is\ntrue in all structures\u201d as \u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d. The\nmodel-theoretic characterization makes it clear that\n\u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d is definable purely in terms of concepts\nof set theory. (The notion of model-theoretic validity for Fregean\nlanguages is explained in thorough detail in the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n second-order and higher-order logic;\n see also the entry on\n model theory.)[9]\n\n(If \\(F\\) is a formula of a first-order language without identity,\nthen if no replacement instance of the form of \\(F\\) is false, this is\na sufficient condition for \\(F\\)'s being model-theoretically valid. As\nit turns out, if \\(F\\) is not model-theoretically valid, then some\nreplacement instance of its form whose variables range over the\nnatural numbers and whose non-logical constants are arithmetical\nexpressions will be false. This can be justified by means of a\nrefinement of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem. See the entry on\n logic, classical,\n and Quine 1970, ch. 4, for discussion and references. No similar\nresults hold for higher-order languages.)\n\nThe \u201cMT\u201d in \u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d stresses the fact\nthat model-theoretic validity is different from universal validity.\nThe notion of a meaning assignment which appears in the description of\nuniversal validity is a very imprecise and intuitive notion, while the\nnotion of a structure appearing in a characterization of\nmodel-theoretic validity is a fairly precise and technical one. It\nseems clear that the notion of a structure for Fregean formalized\nlanguages is minimally reasonable, in the sense that a structure\nmodels the power of one or several meaning assignments to make false\n(the logical form of) some sentence. As we will mention later, the\nconverse property, that each meaning assignment's validity-refuting\npower is modeled by some structure, is also a natural but more\ndemanding requirement on a notion of structure.\n",
