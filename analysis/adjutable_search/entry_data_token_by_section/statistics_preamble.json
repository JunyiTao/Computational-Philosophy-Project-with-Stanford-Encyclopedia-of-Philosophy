    "main_text": "\nStatistics investigates and develops specific methods for\nevaluating hypotheses in the light of empirical facts. A method is\ncalled statistical, and thus the subject of study in statistics, if it\nrelates facts and hypotheses of a particular kind: the empirical facts\nmust be codified and structured into data sets, and the hypotheses\nmust be formulated in terms of probability distributions over possible\ndata sets. The philosophy of statistics concerns the foundations and\nthe proper interpretation of statistical methods, their input, and\ntheir results.  Since statistics is relied upon in almost all\nempirical scientific research, serving to support and communicate\nscientific findings, the philosophy of statistics is of key importance\nto the philosophy of science. It has an impact on the philosophical\nappraisal of scientific method, and on the debate over the epistemic\nand ontological status of scientific theory.\nThe philosophy of statistics harbors a large variety of topics and\ndebates. Central to these is the \n problem of induction,\nwhich concerns the justification of inferences or procedures that\nextrapolate from data to predictions and general facts. Further\ndebates concern the\n interpretation of the probabilities\nthat are used in statistics, and the wider theoretical framework\nthat may ground and justify the correctness of statistical methods. A\ngeneral introduction to these themes is given in\n Section 1 and\n Section 2. \n Section 3 and \n Section 4 provide an account of how\nthese themes play out in the two major theories of statistical method,\nclassical and Bayesian statistics respectively.\n Section 5\ndirects attention to the notion of a statistical model, covering model\nselection and simplicity, but also discussing statistical techniques\nthat do not rely on statistical models. \n Section 6 briefly\nmentions relations between the philosophy of statistics and several\nother themes from the philosophy of science, including \n confirmation theory,\n evidence, \n causality, measurement, and scientific\nmethodology in general.\n",
