    "main_text": "Objections to a Higher-Order Approach || Local objections\n7.1 Local objections\n\nA good many objections against specific versions of higher-order\ntheory have already been discussed above. Thus in section 3 we\ndiscussed Dretske\u2019s (1995) \u2018lack of any higher-order\nphenomenology\u2019 objection to inner sense theory (which\nonly targets inner sense theory). And in section 4 we\ndiscussed Dretske\u2019s (1993) \u2018spot\u2019 objection to actualist\nhigher-order thought theory, as well as Goldman\u2019s (2000)\nepistemological objection, each of which appears to apply only to HOT\ntheories. Of course some of the objections discussed above target more\nthan one version of higher-order theory, while still not being fully\ngeneral in scope. Thus the cognitive/computational complexity\nobjections discussed in sections 3 and 4 apply to inner sense theories\nand to actualist HOT theories, but not to dispositionalist HOT or to\nsome self-representational theories.\n\nAnother \u2018local\u2019 objection (which is actually a\ngeneralization of a variant of the misrepresentation problem discussed\nin connection with inner sense theory in section 3 above) is the\ntargetless higher-order representation problem (Byrne 1997; Neander\n1998; Levine 2001). This is confronted by both inner sense theory and\nactualist HOT theory (but not by either dispositionalist HOT or\nself-representational theories, according to which the relevant\nhigher-order state can\u2019t exist in the absence of the targeted\nstate).  For in each case it seems that a higher-order experience of a\nperception of red, say, or a HOT about a perception of red, might\nexist in the absence of any such perception occurring.  So it\nwould seem to the subject that she is experiencing red, or\nshe might think that she is experiencing red, in the absence\nof any such experience. (Note that the point isn\u2019t just that she\nmight undergo such a seeming in the absence of anything really\nred. Rather, the point is that she might not really be undergoing any\nsort of visual experience as of red at all.) In which case,\ndoes the subject have a phenomenally conscious experience as\nof red, or not?\n\nBoth Lycan (1996) and Rosenthal (2005) are sanguine in the face of\nthis objection. Each allows that targetless higher-order\nrepresentations are a possibility (albeit rare, perhaps), and each\nopts to say that the subject in such a case is phenomenally conscious.\nBut each denies that this is a problem for their account. Lycan, for\nexample, insists that it is surely possible that it might\nseem to someone that she is feeling pain when really no\nrelevant first-order representation of pain is present. (He suggests\nthat the effects of morphine, which leaves patients saying that their\npain feels just as it was, but that they no longer care, might\nconstitute such a case.) And surely such a person would have a\nphenomenally conscious experience as of pain. Rosenthal,\nlikewise, uses pain as an example. He points to cases of dental\npatients who initially experience pain in the dentist\u2019s chair despite\nthe fact that the relevant nerves are completely destroyed. It seems\nthat their fear, combined with the noise and vibration of the drill,\ncauses them to mistakenly think that they are feeling pain. (When\nthe drilling is stopped, and their dead nerves are explained to them,\nthey thereafter experience only the sound and the vibration.) So this\nwould be a case in which a HOT about experiencing\npain is alone sufficient to induce a phenomenally conscious experience\nas of being in pain. A critic, however, might respond that\nthe illusion is caused, instead, by a vivid imagining of\npain, rather than by a HOT about feeling pain.  Alternatively, if a\nHOT is causally involved it might be that a top-down expectation of\npain causes a first-order experience of pain, as opposed to\nbeing constitutive of the feeling of pain. It might be\nthat introspective anticipation of pain causes the pain in\nthe first-place. (Note that this seems perfectly possible, since it is\nthe opposite of well-known placebo effects of expectation in reducing\npain.)\n The targetless HOT problem has recently become a very significant\ntopic of debate among HOT theorists as well as some critics (Block\n2011; Rosenthal 2005, 2011; Weisberg 2011; Gennaro 2012, chapter four;\nWilberg 2010; Berger 2014, 2017; Brown 2015; Lau and Brown 2019) which\nhas also led some to advocate for other variants of HOT theory or to\nclarify their own theories. Gennaro (2012) argues, for example, that\nsince the HOTs in question are typically themselves unconscious, it\nmakes little sense to suppose that these HOTs are phenomenally\nconscious in the context of HOT theory, especially since a conscious\nHOT would be an introspective state instead. Maintaining that an\nunconscious HOT would yield the same subjective experience without any\ntarget state seems to run counter to a central initial motivation of\nHOT theory, namely, to explain what makes a first-order state\nconscious. Thus, the first-order state must exist first in order to be\nrendered conscious by an appropriate and accompanying HOT with some\nsort of corresponding conceptual content.  If both aren\u2019t\npresent, then no relevant conscious state occurs (see also Wilberg\n2010). Berger (2014), however, argues that consciousness is not a\nproperty of states at all; instead, it is a property of individual\npersons (that is, how my mental states appear to me). And\nBrown (2015) challenges the very assumption that HOT theory is best\ninterpreted as a relational theory at all; instead, it is better\nconstrued as a HOROR theory, that is, higher-order representation of a\nrepresentation, regardless of whether or not the target representation\nexists. In this sense, HOT theory is better understood\nas non-relational which also seems to be Rosenthal\u2019s\nconsidered view in recent decades. The debate continues (Rosenthal\n2018). \n\nIn response specifically to Block (2011), Rosenthal (2011) and\nWeisberg (2011) stress that the mere seeming of, say, being\nin pain (provided by the HOT that one is in pain in the absence of\nfirst-order pain) is sufficient for phenomenally conscious\npain. Consciousness is about mental appearance. It is not\nclear that this fully addresses Block\u2019s point, which is that one\nwould not expect the mere thoughts that one feels pain\nto matter to us in all the ways that pain matters. Block\ndevelops this point with respect to the awfulness of pain. It\nwould be remarkable (indeed, mysterious) if a higher-order thought\nshould have all of the causal powers of the mental state that the\nthought is about. And in particular, there is no reason to expect that\na HOT that one is in pain should possess the negative valence and\nhigh-arousal properties of pain itself. But the latter are surely\ncrucial components of phenomenally conscious pain. If so, then a HOT\nthat one feels pain in the absence of first-order pain\nwill not be sufficient for the conscious feeling of pain. It\nis also again important not to conflate introspection (conscious HOTs)\nwith mere unconscious HOTs. (See also Shepherd 2013.)\n\nYet another \u2018local\u2019 objection is targeted against\nhigher-order thought theories in particular (whether actualist or\ndispositionalist). It presents such theories with a dilemma: either\nthey are attempts to explicate the concept of consciousness,\nin which case they are circular; or they are attempts to provide a\nreductive explanation of the property of being conscious, in\nwhich case they generate a vicious regress (Rowlands 2001). The first\nhorn can be swiftly dismissed. For as Rosenthal (2005) and many others\nhave made clear, higher-order theories aren\u2019t in the business of\nconceptual analysis. Rather, their goal is to provide a reductive\nexplanation of what it is for a state to be phenomenally\nconscious. Our discussion will therefore focus upon the second\nhorn.\n\nRowlands thinks that HOT theories face a vicious regress because they\nexplain state-consciousness in terms of HOT, and because (Rowlands\nclaims) only conscious thoughts make us aware of the things\nthat those thoughts concern. He gives the example of coming to believe\nthat his dog is seriously ill. If he (Rowlands) thinks and behaves in\nways that are best explained by attributing to him the thought that\nhis dog is ill, but if that thoughts isn\u2019t entertained\nconsciously, then surely this won\u2019t be a case in which he\nis aware that his dog is ill. So if we are to become aware of\nour conscious states by entertaining higher-order thoughts about them,\nthen these thoughts will have to be conscious ones, requiring us to be\naware of them, in turn, via further higher-order thoughts that are\nalso conscious; and so on.\n\nHOT theorists might respond in several ways: One is to challenge the\nintuition that only conscious thoughts make us aware of things. Thus\nit seems that Rowlands, when reflecting back on his dog-nurturing\nbehavior of recent days, could surely conclude something along the\nlines of, \u2018It seems that I have been aware of my dog\u2019s\nillness all along; that is why I have been behaving as I have.\u2019\nAnother response would be to allow that there is a way of\nunderstanding the concept of awareness such that a person only counts\nas aware of something if the mental state in virtue of which they are\naware of that thing is itself a conscious one, but to deny that this\nis the relevant sense of \u2018awareness\u2019 which is put to work\nin HOT theories. A third option would be to stress the distinction\nbetween phenomenal consciousness and state consciousness more\ngenerally, claiming that there need be no regress involved in\nexplaining the former in terms of the latter, provided that some\nseparate account can be provided for the latter.\n",
