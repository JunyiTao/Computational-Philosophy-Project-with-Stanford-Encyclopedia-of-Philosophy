But Trevett\nclaims that \u201cit is special in the thoroughness of that appeal to\nBiblical precedent, in its sometimes cautious, but often spirited, case\nfor women, in its criticism of Church and clergy, and in its\noptimism\u201d (Trevett 1991, 54). In this work\u2014first published\nin 1666, and then with a new postscript in 1667\u2014Fell brings\ntogether many of the different argumentative strategies used in the\naforementioned Quaker texts. She reinterprets key scriptural passages,\nshe provides numerous examples of biblical women speakers, she draws\nout the egalitarian implications of the doctrine of the light, and she\nappeals to anti-clerical and anti-authoritarian Quaker principles. In\nshort, she presents one of the \u201cmost comprehensively\nargued\u201d Quaker defences of female preaching in her time (Trevett\n1991, 54). There is also evidence that Fell first formulated her arguments as early as 1652, prior to other Quaker defences of women (cf. Bruyneel 2010, 148; Donawerth and Lush 2018, 48).\n3.3.1 Spiritual equality\n\n\nFell\u2019s primary concern is to establish \u201chow God himself\nhath manifested his Will and Mind concerning women, and unto\nwomen\u201d (Fell 1667c, 3). Toward this end, she examines significant\npassages about women in both the Old and New Testaments. In the\nbeginning (in Genesis 1:27), she notes, God joined male and female\ntogether in his own image and made no distinction between the sexes: he\n\u201cput no such difference between Male and Female as men would\nmake\u201d (Fell 1667c, 3). Following the fall, this spiritual\nequality between the sexes was compromised. The Serpent approached Eve,\ndiscerning that she was \u201cmore inclinable\u201d to listen to him;\nand then, together with Adam, she was \u201ctempted into the\ntransgression and disobedience\u201d (3, 4). But when Eve tells God\nthe truth about the temptation and confesses her sin, God passes\nsentence on the Serpent: \u201cI will put enmity between thee and the\nWoman,\u201d he says, \u201cand between thy Seed and her Seed\u201d\n(4). In Fell\u2019s view, these words (from Genesis 3:15) foretell the\nspecial role that women would play in the restoration of humankind. The\n\u201cSeed of the Woman\u201d refers to Christ himself, who is the\nSon of God \u201cmade of a woman\u201d, the Virgin Mary (4).\nThose who prevent the Seed (or the inner light) of the Woman from\nspeaking, Fell says, prevent the message of Christ:\n\n\nThose that speak against the Power of the Lord, and the Spirit of\nthe Lord speaking in a woman, simply, by reason of her Sex, or because\nshe is a Woman, not regarding the Seed, and Spirit, and Power that\nspeaks in her; such speak against Christ, and his Church, and are of\nthe Seed of the Serpent, wherein lodgeth enmity. (5)\n\n\n\nIn Fell\u2019s view, the coming of Christ returns the spiritual\nstanding of men and women to that of \u201cthe first Creation\u201d.\nOnce again, the sexes are on an equal footing because they each have\nthe spirit or the light of Christ manifest within them: his\n\u201cSpirit is poured upon all flesh, both Sons and Daughters\u201d\n(12). Following the redemption, the \u201cLord hath manifested himself\nand his Power, without respect of Persons\u201d (12), and\n\u201cChrist in the Male and in the Female is one\u201d (13).\n\n\nFell thus severely criticizes those men or \u201cblind\nPriests\u201d who \u201cpervert the Apostles Words, and corrupt his\nintent\u201d by \u201ccontemning and despising\u201d women in order\nto prevent them from speaking in church (10, 14). To prevent a woman\nfrom speaking is to limit the power of Christ \u201cwhose Power and\nSpirit is infinite, that is pouring it upon all flesh\u201d (12). She\nsees the priests\u2019 tendency as part of a larger tendency of\n\u201cthe spirit of Darkness\u201d (i.e. the state-sanctioned church)\nto prevent both Quaker men and women from spreading the message of God.\nFell foretells of a new age dawning \u201cwhich brings freedom and\nliberty\u201d (11), and in which all those who are in the spirit of\nthe Lord (men as well as women) can speak freely, without prejudice and\npersecution. In this sense, her book is (implicitly, at least) a\ncontinuation of her fight for liberty of conscience and the rights of\n\u201cfree-born English men and women\u201d in her other\nworks (Fell 1664, 1; cf. also Skwire 2015).\n3.3.2 Biblical exempla\n\n\nTo validate her claims, Fell appeals to biblical examples of good\nand wise women, such as the woman of Samaria, Martha and Mary (the\nsisters of Lazarus), and the woman who poured precious ointment on\nChrist\u2019s head, as well as Priscilla, Deborah, Huldah, Sarah, Anna\nthe Prophetess, Miriam, Elizabeth, Mary, Ruth, Rachel, Leah, the Queen\nof Sheba, Esther (or Hester), Judith, the wise woman of Abel, and the\ndaughters of Philip. These women provide historical proof that God gave\nhis spirit to women as well as men. But Fell singles out Mary\nMagdalene, Joanna, and Mary (mother of James)\u2014the women who first\ndelivered the news of Christ\u2019s resurrection to the\napostles\u2014for special mention. If these women had not exhibited\nthe virtues of love and loyalty to Christ, Fell says, then \u201cwhat\nhad become of the Redemption of the whole body of Mankind?\u201d (Fell\n1667c, 7). In essence, she offers a pragmatic argument for permitting\nwomen to speak in church. If the apostles had not listened to women,\nthen the restitution of humanity would never have come about. Women\nclearly have a special providential role to play in spreading the word\nof the Lord. If ministers do not permit women to speak in church, then\nterrible consequences might follow.\n3.3.3 Scriptural exegesis\n\n\nIn light of Fell\u2019s points about women\u2019s spiritual\nequality with men and their special role in redemptive history, she\nadvises her readers to re-interpret or re-contextualize those common\ninjunctions against women\u2019s speaking in the Bible. She begins\nwith 1 Corinthians 14:34, \u201cLet your women keep silence in the\nchurches\u201d. In a passage preceding this statement, Fell points\nout, \u201cthe Man is commanded to keep silence as well as the woman,\nwhen they are in confusion and out of order\u201d (8). The\napostle\u2019s words apply only to those women who are in\n\u201cstrife, confusion and malice in their speaking\u201d\n(9)\u2014those women who were \u201cunder the Law, and in that\nTransgression as Eve was\u201d (8). But his words do not\napply to those women who have the \u201cEverlasting Gospel to preach,\nand upon whom the Promise of the Lord is fulfilled\u201d\n(9)\u2014they do not apply to those who have turned to the light.\n\n\nIn \u201cA further Addition\u201d to the main text, Fell extends\nher analysis to 1 Timothy 2:11, \u201cLet Women learn in silence, with\nall subjection\u201d. Her argument proceeds by way of simple modus\ntollens. If this injunction applied to all women, she says, then\nno woman would be permitted to speak. But the apostle does\npermit women to speak\u2014he explicitly mentions the four virgin\ndaughters of Philip (Acts 21:9), who were respected as prophets.\n\u201cAnd was it not prophesied in Joel 2. that Hand\nmaids should Propesie [sic]? And are not Hand-maids\nwomen?\u201d (14). Therefore, some women must be permitted to speak.\nTo explain the apostle\u2019s command to silence, Fell suggests that\n\u201chere you ought to make a distinction what sort of Women are\nforbidden to speak\u201d (13). The reader ought to distinguish between\nthose women who are mere \u201cbusie-bodies, and\ntatlers\u201d (13) and those women who have the spirit of the\nLord. We might also consider the idea that a woman\u2019s\n\u201chusband\u201d in this passage is in fact Christ himself, and\nthat if a woman learns from this Husband, then she ought to be\npermitted to speak (17).\n\n\nIn a \u201cPostscript\u201d to the 1667 edition, Fell once again\naddresses those \u201cdark Priests\u201d who are \u201cso mad\nagainst Womens Speaking\u201d (18). She refers to the example of\nDeborah (Judges 5), a woman leader who sung and praised God in\n\u201cglorious triumphing expressions\u201d (18). Fell points out the\nhypocrisy of those priests who forbid women to preach and yet include\nthe words of Deborah in their sermons. She scorns those who \u201cmake\na Trade of Womens words to get money by, and take Texts, and Preach\nSermons upon Womens words; and still cry out, Women must not speak,\nWomen must be Silent\u201d (16). These priests are being blatantly\ncontradictory: they allow that women can speak the word of God, and yet\nthey deny that women can speak the word of God.\n\n\nAt this point, it might also be noted that Fell\u2019s works were\noften intended to be read aloud, and so we must be aware of a certain\nperformative aspect to Womens Speaking. The author\u2019s\nargument achieves its greatest force when it is spoken or performed.\nThis is because the very act of saying the words establishes the\nconclusion of Fell\u2019s argument\u2014the idea that women are\ncapable of speaking the word of the Lord. The onus then falls on her\ncritics to point out where she speaks in ignorance. But given that she\nrepeats the same scriptural passages that they themselves use (her\narguments rely on premises they would accept), then there would appear\nto be little comeback.\n",
