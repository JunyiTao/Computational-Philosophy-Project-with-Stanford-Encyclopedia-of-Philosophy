    "main_text": "Metaphysical Issues || On a Very Different Idea of Conceptual Schemes\n2.2 On a Very Different Idea of Conceptual Schemes\nIn 1973 Donald Davidson published an influential paper claiming,\nnuances aside, that the idea of cognitive relativism\u2014with truth\nrelative to particular conceptual schemes\u2014was incoherent.\nDavidson\u2019s argument hinges on his rejection of what he calls\n\u201cThe third dogma of empiricism\u201d, namely, that we can\nmeaningfully distinguish conceptual schemes from an uninterpreted\nreality\u2014taken as \u201ca neutral ground\u201d or\n\u201ccoordinate system\u201d\u2014by means of which we could\ncompare and contrast differing conceptual schemes. He says:\n  In giving up dependence on the concept of an\nuninterpreted reality \u2026we do not relinquish the concept of\nobjective truth\u2014quite the contrary. Given the dogma of a dualism\nof scheme and reality, we get conceptual relativity, and truth\nrelative to a scheme.  Without the dogma, this kind of relativity goes\nby the board. Of course truth of sentences remains relative to\nlanguage, but that is as objective as can be. (Davidson 1973:\n20)\nAngus Graham rejected Davidson\u2019s claim, saying that the\npostulation of conceptual schemes different from our (modern Western)\none was \u201cinescapable\u201d for scholars of the language and\nthought of other cultures, and indeed, \u201cthat the very idea was\nan indispensable tool for such inquirers, to which Davidson\u2019s\nobjections did not directly apply.\u201d (Graham 1992: 59).\nThe idea that truth might be relative to a conceptual\nscheme, however, was as abhorrent to Graham as it was incoherent to\nDavidson. To be sensitive to the differing thought patterns of another\nculture while yet not descending into philosophical unintelligibility\nor epistemological chaos Graham argued that languages not having a\ncommon ancestor will seldom have synonymous terms in their lexicons,\nand consequently many sentences in such languages (i.e., English and\nChinese) will not be fully intertranslatable because they do not\nexpress the same proposition (1992: 65). He can thus hold to a\nconception of truth by claiming that \u201cif a true\nstatement does have a translation equivalent \u2026 the latter will\nbe true as well\u201d (1992: 68).\nThe major problem with Davidson\u2019s account is that he\nconstrues \u201cconceptual schemes\u201d as sets of propositions, on\nthe basis of which he is claiming that there can only be one such true\nset. But as we have already begun to see\u2014and will see more\nof\u2014from the example of Chinese philosophy written in classical\nChinese, the Chinese concern is much more with naming, syntax, and\nwhat we might call \u201cwritten rhetoric\u201d\u2014composing\npersuasive ideas and transmitting them for effect both visually and\naurally\u2014rather than truth in the propositional sense (for which\nthere is no close lexical equivalent in Chinese). Hansen has gone the\nfarthest with this claim throughout his major work: \u201c\u2026\nlanguage is a social practice. Its basic function is guiding\naction\u201d (1992: 3).\nIndeed, for Graham and others the acceptance of the idea of\ndiffering conceptual schemes to explain different vocabularies and\nsyntactic patterns is one important reason that makes the study of\nChinese philosophy interesting, so long as we also treat the different\nschemes as equals and not treat one as in any way inferior to the\nother. Seen as equals, it then becomes\n  \u2026 possible to use one to criticize something\nin another, as Fingarette uses Confucius to undermine our inner/outer\ndichotomy, Rosemont the problematic of moral choice, Hall and Ames the\nconcept of transcendence. (Graham 1992: 78)\nWe will be inclined to think of conceptual schemes as either true\nor false if they are seen as systems of propositions as Davidson is\nimplying, but we can also view them as \u201ca pre-logical pattern of\nnames \u2026 as the product of the classifying act of naming\u201d,\naccording to Graham (1992: 68). And this is a proper area of study for\nlinguists, sinologists and philosophers; indeed, for Graham and many\nothers it is an area necessary to study for discussing\nsimilarities and differences cross-culturally with any precision or\nclarity (1992: 69).\n There is, however, another dimension of Davidson\u2019s position\nthat is also connected directly to his concern with propositional\ntruth as the locus of a \u201cconceptual scheme\u201d, but connected\nin another way.\n",
