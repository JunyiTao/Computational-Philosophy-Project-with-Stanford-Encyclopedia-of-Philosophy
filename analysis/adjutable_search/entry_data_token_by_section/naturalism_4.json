    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || Physicalist Downwards Causation\n1.5 Physicalist Downwards Causation\nSome recent writers have explored a different way of upholding the\ncausal efficacy of non-reduced mental and other special causes. Where\nthe \u201cbenign overdetermination\u201d option says certain effects\nhave a special cause as well as a physical cause, these\nwriters urge that some effects have a special cause instead\nof a physical cause.\nSuppose a pigeon pecks at crimson tiles. Is the pecking caused by\nthe specific shade, crimson, or the more generic colour, red? The\nnatural answer is that it depends. If the pigeon pecks only at crimson\ntiles, and not at other shades of red, then it is the crimsonness that\nis causing the pecking; but if the pigeon pecks at any shade of\nred, it is the redness. Examples like these have led a number of\nwriters to require that causes be proportional to their\neffects (Yablo 1992; Menzies 2008; List and Menzies 2009, 2010).  We\nshould attribute the effect to that property that is specific enough\nto suffice for it, but no more specific than that.\nThis suggests that sometimes special causes and not their\nphysical realizers might be responsible for physical effects. Suppose\nI want to hail a taxi, and that this desire is realized by some brain\nstate, and that I then wave my arm. It seems that it will then be the\ndesire that is proportional to the waving, not the brain state, in\nthat I would still have waved my arm if my desire had been differently\nrealized, though not if I hadn\u2019t had the desire at all.\nSome will say that in such cases the desire\ncausally explains the waving, but that it is still the brain\nstate that causes it. This thought appeals to the intuition\nthat real causal relations are always constituted by basic physical\ninteractions, by bits of matter bumping into each other. But this\nintuition is not decisive, and a number of theoretical considerations\nspeak against it.  For instance, the \u201cdifference-making\u201d\naccount of causation developed by James Woodward implies that generic\nproperties often eclipse their more specific realizations as\ncauses (Woodward 2005), as does the view that causation is a\nrelatively macroscopic phenomenon whose temporal asymmetry is\nanalogous to the temporal asymmetries of thermodynamics (Loewer 2007,\nPapineau 2013).\nIt is worth observing that physicalists who advocate this kind of\ndownwards special causation are in some danger of sawing off the\nbranch they are sitting on, in that they now seem to be advocating\ncounter-examples to the causal closure of the physical. If my\narm\u2019s waving is caused by my desire and not by my brain state,\nit would seem to have a mental cause and not a physical cause, and thus run counter to\nthe closure thesis that every physical effect has some fully physical\ncause. Since the original rationale for embracing physicalism was\nsupposed to be science\u2019s discovery that the physical realm is\ncausally closed, this may seem to leave physicalists in an awkward\nposition.\nHowever, even if the examples of \u201cdownwards\u201d causation\ndo undermine the thesis of the causal closure of the physical, it\nmay still be possible to rework the original argument for\nphysicalism in terms of closure under nomological determination,\nrather than causal\n closure.[7]\n Nothing in the idea of proportional\ncausation threatens the idea that modern physics shows that all\nphysical effects (or their chances) are fully nomologically\ndetermined by physical antecedents, even if they aren\u2019t always caused by them. And this in itself argues that metaphysically independent special causes would imply an unacceptable strong overdetermination of physical events.\n",
