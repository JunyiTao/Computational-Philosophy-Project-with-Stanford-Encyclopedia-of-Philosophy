    "main_text": "Hermeneutical Foundations || Ontology and Hermeneutics\n2.2 Ontology and Hermeneutics\n\nTraditionally, hermeneutics is taken to have its origins in problems\nof biblical exegesis and in the development of a theoretical framework\nto govern and direct such exegetical practice. In the hands of\neighteenth and early nineteenth century theorists, writers such as\nChladenius and Meier, Ast and Schleiermacher, hermeneutics was\ndeveloped into a more encompassing theory of textual interpretation in\ngeneral\u2014a set of rules that provide the basis for good\ninterpretive practice no matter what the subject matter. Inasmuch as\nhermeneutics is the method proper to the recovery of meaning, so\nWilhelm Dilthey broadened hermeneutics still further, taking it as the\nmethodology for the recovery of meaning that is essential to\nunderstanding within the \u2018human\u2019 or\n\u2018historical\u2019 sciences (the\nGeisteswissenschaften). For these writers, as for many\nothers, the basic problem of hermeneutics was methodological: how to\nfound the human sciences, and so how to found the science of\ninterpretation, in a way that would make them properly\n\u2018scientific\u2019. Moreover, if the mathematical models and\nprocedures that appeared to be the hallmark of the sciences of nature\ncould not be duplicated in the human sciences, then the task at issue\nmust involve finding an alternative methodology proper to the human\nsciences as such\u2014hence Schleiermacher\u2019s ambition to\ndevelop a formal methodology that would codify interpretive practice,\nwhile Dilthey aimed at the elaboration of a \u2018psychology\u2019\nthat would elucidate and guide interpretive understanding.\n\nAlready familiar with earlier hermeneutic thinking, Heidegger\nredeployed hermeneutics to a very different purpose and within a very\ndifferent frame. In Heidegger\u2019s early thinking, particularly the\nlectures from the early 1920s (\u2018The Hermeneutics of\nFacticity\u2019), hermeneutics is presented as that by means of which\nthe investigation of the basic structures of factical existence is to\nbe pursued\u2014not as that which constitutes a \u2018theory\u2019\nof textual interpretation nor a method of \u2018scientific\u2019\nunderstanding, but rather as that which allows the self-disclosure of\nthe structure of understanding as such. The \u2018hermeneutic\ncircle\u2019 that had been a central idea in previous hermeneutic\nthinking, and that had been viewed in terms of the interpretative\ninterdependence, within any meaningful structure, between the parts of\nthat structure and the whole, was transformed by Heidegger, so that it\nwas now seen as expressing the way in which all understanding was\n\u2018always already\u2019 given over to that which is to be\nunderstood (to \u2018the things themselves\u2019\u2014die\nSachen selbst). Thus, to take a simple example, if we wish to\nunderstand some particular artwork, we must already have some prior\nunderstanding of that work (even if only as a set of paint marks on\ncanvas), otherwise it cannot even be seen as something to be\nunderstood. To put the point more generally, and in more basic\nontological terms, if we are to understand anything at all, we must\nalready find ourselves \u2018in\u2019 the world \u2018along\nwith\u2019 that which is to be understood. All understanding that is\ndirected at the grasp of some particular subject matter is thus based\nin a prior \u2018ontological\u2019 understanding\u2014a prior\nhermeneutical situatedness. On this basis, hermeneutics can be\nunderstood as the attempt to \u2018make explicit\u2019 the structure\nof such situatedness. Yet since that situatedness is indeed prior to\nany specific event of understanding, so it must always be presupposed\neven in the attempt at its own explication. Consequently, the\nexplication of this situatedness\u2014of this basic ontological mode\nof understanding\u2014is essentially a matter of exhibiting or\n\u2018laying-bare\u2019 a structure with which we are already\nfamiliar (as well as a structure that is present in every event of\nunderstanding) and in which we are already embedded. In this respect,\nhermeneutics becomes one with phenomenology, itself understood, in\nHeidegger\u2019s thinking, as just such a \u2018laying bare\u2019\n(it also takes the form, given the focus on situation and\nsituatedness, of what Heidegger later calls a \u2018topology\u2019\n(Topologie) or a \u2018saying of place\u2019\u2014see\nMalpas 2014).\n\nIt is hermeneutics, in this Heideggerian and phenomenological sense,\nthat is taken up in Gadamer\u2019s work, and that leads him, in\nconjunction with certain other insights from Heidegger\u2019s later\nthinking, as well as the ideas of dialogue and practical wisdom, to\nelaborate a philosophical hermeneutics that provides an account of the\nnature of understanding in its universality (where this refers both to\nthe ontologically fundamental character of the hermeneutical situation\nand the all-encompassing nature of hermeneutic practice) and, in the\nprocess, to develop a response to the earlier hermeneutic\ntradition\u2019s preoccupation with the problem of interpretive\nmethod. In these respects, Gadamer\u2019s work, in conjunction with\nthat of Heidegger, represents a radical reworking of the idea of\nhermeneutics that constitutes a break with the preceding hermeneutical\ntradition at the same time as it also reflects back on that tradition.\nGadamer thus develops a philosophical hermeneutics that provides an\naccount of the proper ground for understanding, while nevertheless\nrejecting the attempt, whether in relation to the\nGeisteswissenschaften or elsewhere, to found understanding on\nany method or set of rules. This is not a rejection of the importance\nof methodological concerns, but rather an insistence on the limited\nrole of method and the priority of understanding as a dialogic,\npractical, situated activity.\n",
