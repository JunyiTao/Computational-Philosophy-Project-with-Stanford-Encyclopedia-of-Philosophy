Although volumes have been written about\nthe theory and practice of democracy, the concept remains difficult to\ndefine. Etymologically the term is simple enough: democracy means rule\nby the people (demos meaning \u2018people\u2019 and\nkratos meaning \u2018rule\u2019 or \u2018power\u2019).\nThis basic definition can be extrapolated in many different ways. At\nits core, however, most scholars agree that democracy refers to a\npolitical practice in which individuals govern themselves through some\nform of equitable decision-making process. This leaves open two\nfundamental issues: who constitutes \u2018the people\u2019 and how\n\u2018rule-making\u2019 should occur.\n\n\nHistorically, democracy first took hold in the ancient city states of\nMesopotamia and Greece through direct mechanisms such as sortition\n(Keane 2009). Since the 18th Century, though, the ideal of\ndemocracy has become wedded to rise of the nation-state. The modern\nstate is a distinctive form of political organization based on\nsovereign autonomy over a delimited territory and population. Through\na centrally organized government, the state wields a monopoly over the\nlegitimate use of violence as well as the right to taxation (Giddens\n1985). In exchange for these coercive powers, the state generates its\nlegitimacy through democratic mechanisms: giving its citizenry equal\nsay in how national laws and public policy are formed.\n\n\nNational democracy is typically institutionalized as a representative\nsystem that involves competitive elections and a publicly determined\nrule of law. Although there are many different national voting systems\n(majority rule, proportional representation, etc.), the basic idea is\nthat each enfranchised citizen of the state has one vote at the ballot\nbox and can thus freely choose their preferred representative, leader,\nor party. Through the American and French Revolutions, and the\n\u2018Third Wave of Democratization\u2019 (where representative\ndemocracy spread to Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, and the Eastern\nbloc), the notion that the nation-state is the natural container for\ndemocracy became dominant (Huntington 1991). Over time, then,\n\u2018the people\u2019 in democracy has been assumed to correspond\nneatly with the citizenry of each particular nation-state.\n\n\nIn recent years, however, the supposed alliance between democracy and\nthe nation-state has come unstuck. This is due predominantly to\nglobalization: the increased extent, velocity, and scope of\ncross-border interactions, transactions, and relations (Scholte 2000).\nGlobalization intensifies social, political, and economic relations\nthrough technological changes and the flow of people, resources and\nideas across state lines. The expansion of global connections has gone\nhand-in-glove with increased efforts to govern global affairs.\nCountless formal measures, informal norms and overarching discourses\nfor regulating global affairs are now formulated and implemented\nthrough complex transnational networks that combine substate agencies,\nnation-states, regional bodies, global institutions, and non-state\nactors (Scholte 2014, 4). Although the state is often an active\nparticipant in globalization, many scholars have argued that increased\ntransnational activity undermines national democracy (Sassen 2003).\nGlobalization pierces the sovereignty of nation-states by subjecting\ndomestic affairs to transnational decision-making. Moreover, citizens\nof each state are often said to be problematically excluded from\nglobal activities in ways that lead to a democratic deficit (expanded\nupon below).\n",
