    "main_text": "Roles of Imagination || Creativity\n3.5 Creativity\n\nThe idea that imagination plays a central role in creative processes\ncan be traced back to Immanuel Kant (Critique of Pure\nReason), who takes artistic geniuses as paradigmatic examples of\ncreativity. On Kant\u2019s account, when imagination aims at the\naesthetic, it is allowed to engage in free play beyond the\nunderstanding available to oneself. The unconstrained imagination can\nthereby take raw materials and produce outputs that transcend concepts\nthat one possesses.\n\nWhile the precise characterization of creativity remains controversial\n(see Gaut & Kieran (eds.) 2018; Paul & Kaufman (eds.) 2014),\ncontemporary philosophers typically conceive of it more broadly than\nKant did. In addition to creative processes in the aesthetic realm,\nthey also consider creative processes in, for example, \u201cscience,\ncraft, business, technology, organizational life and everyday\nactivities\u201d (Gaut 2010: 1034; see also Stokes 2011). As an\nexample, Michael Polanyi (1966) gives imagination a central role in\nthe creative endeavor of scientific discovery, by refining and\nnarrowing the solution space to open-ended scientific problems (see\nStokes 2016: 252\u2013256). And, in addition to creative processes of\ngeniuses, contemporary philosophers also consider creative processes\nof ordinary people.\n\nWith this broadened scope, contemporary philosophers have followed\nKant\u2019s lead in exploring the role of imagination in creativity\n(see Stokes 2016 for an overview). Berys Gaut (2003) and Dustin Stokes\n(2014) argue that two characteristic features of imagination\u2014its\nlack of aim at truth and its dissociation from action\u2014make it\nespecially suitable for creative processes. Peter Carruthers (2002)\nargues that the same cognitive resources, including imagination,\nunderlie children\u2019s pretend play and adults\u2019 creative\nthinking. Specifically, Carruthers hypothesizes that children\u2019s\nplay evolutionarily developed as precursors to and practices for\nadults\u2019 creative thinking.\n\nThere are two points of disagreement regarding the role of imagination\nin creative processes. First, philosophers disagree about the nature\nand the strength of the connection between imagination and creativity.\nKant takes imagination to be constitutive of creativity: what\nmakes a creative process creative is the involvement of imagination\naiming at the aesthetic (see also A. Hills & Bird forthcoming).\nGaut and Stokes, by contrast, thinks there is only an imperfect\ncausal connection between imagination and creativity: while\nimagination is useful for creative processes, there are creative\nprocesses that do not involve imagination and there are imaginings\nthat are uncreative (see also Beaney 2005). Second, philosophers\ndisagree about the type of imagination involved in creative processes.\nBy hypothesizing a common evolutionary cause, Carruthers suggests that\nthe same imaginative capacity is involved in pretense and in\ncreativity. By contrast, perhaps echoing Kant\u2019s distinction of\nproductive versus reproductive imagination, Currie and Ravenscroft\n(2002) sharply distinguish recreative imagination, which is involved\nin pretense and mindreading, from creative imagination.\n",
