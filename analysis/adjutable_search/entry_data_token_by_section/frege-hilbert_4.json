Lingering Issues\n\nWe have surveyed two ways of understanding Frege\u2019s objections to\nHilbert\u2019s techniques for proving consistency and independence.\nThe first takes Frege to be fundamentally mistaken, with the error\nlocated in his failure to appreciate the connection between the\nsatisfiability of a set of reinterpretable sentences and the\nassociated independence/consistency claims. The second takes Frege to\nbe fundamentally correct in the sense that (i) he understands the\nconsistency and independence of thoughts to turn not just on the\nsurface syntax of the sentences that express them but also on the\ncontents of the simple terms used in their expression, and (ii)\nconsistency and independence, so understood, are not demonstrable in\nHilbert\u2019s manner. \n\nNeither of these interpretive options is entirely unproblematic. An\nimportant difficulty with the first is its attribution to Frege of a\nsevere degree of confusion about the force of Hilbert\u2019s\nre-interpretations, which is arguably in some tension with the fact\nthat, generally speaking, Frege\u2019s account of Hilbert\u2019s\nmethodological procedure in FG is considerably clearer than is\nHilbert\u2019s own. A further source of difficulty is that the\nunderstanding of independence attributed on this account to Frege is\nin tension with the understanding of logical entailment that figures\ncentrally in his logicist work, an understanding on which the contents\nof mathematical terms can be crucial to questions of logical\nentailment. The second interpretation, though more charitable to\nFrege, arguably suffers from the lack of explicit mention by Frege of\nthe relevance of conceptual analysis to questions of consistency and\nindependence. \n\nA final source of potential difficulty for any account of\nFrege\u2019s views of independence and consistency is the very\ninteresting Part (iii) of the 1906 \u201cFoundations of\nGeometry\u201d essay. The importance of that text, and the\ninterpretive difficulties it poses, can be sketched as follows.\n\nThe 1906 \u201cFoundations of Geometry\u201d essay is primarily a\nre-statement of Frege\u2019s earlier objections (discussed above) to\nHilbert\u2019s treatment of consistency and independence. After a\nrehearsal of those objections, Frege turns in Part iii to the problem\nof giving a positive method for proving independence. How, he asks,\nmight one prove a given thought independent of a collection\nof thoughts? In answer, Frege provides a sketch of a potential method,\nand ends the discussion by noting that the method sketched is still\nincomplete, and that it faces some difficulties. Despite the obvious\nincompleteness, Frege never (as far as we can tell) returns to the\nproposal, and would seem in the end to have found it unsatisfactory.\nThat he thought it unsatisfactory in principle is indicated by his\nclaim four years later, in a note to Jourdain, that the unprovability\nof the parallels axiom cannot be proven (see Frege 1980: 183n). That\nis, he would seem by 1910 to hold that there is no systematic method\nfor proving\n independence.[11]\n\nThe 1906 proposal itself can be outlined as follows. Suppose, says\nFrege, that we have a collection C of sentences each of which\nexpresses a determinate thought, and a sentence S that similarly\nexpresses a determinate thought. The heart of the proposed method for\nproving the independence of the S-thought from the C-thoughts is that\nwe employ a mapping \u03bc of terms to terms (and hence also of\nsentences to sentences) that preserves syntactic type (mapping names\nto names, one-place predicates to one-place predicates, etc.) and maps\n\u2019logical\u2019 terms to themselves. Then: the S-thought is\nindependent of the C-thoughts if \u03bc maps S to a false sentence while\nmapping all the members of C to true sentences. (For discussion and\ndevelopment of Frege\u2019s proposal, see Antonelli & May 2000,\nEder 2016. For discussion\nof Frege\u2019s reasons for rejecting the proposal, see Ricketts\n1997, Eder 2013, Blanchette 2014.) \n\nThe first intriguing thing about the proposal is its striking\nsimilarity to Hilbert\u2019s method. Assuming Frege\u2019s language\nto be rich enough to include terms for all of the objects, functions\nand sets that Hilbert might use in reinterpretations, there will\narguably be a mapping of the kind Frege describes if and only if there\nis a reinterpretation of the kind Hilbert uses to show (his version\nof) independence: where Hilbert\u2019s reinterpretation provides a\nterm t with new content, Frege\u2019s method would simply map\nt to a new term with that very content. And this would mean\nthat, despite all of the objections raised by Frege, Hilbert\u2019s\nmethod would in the end suffice to demonstrate what Frege regards as\nthe independence of thoughts. If this is correct, then we have reason\nto doubt any interpretation of Frege on which his rejection of\nHilbert\u2019s method is justified. \n\nThe central reasons one might doubt the strong equivalence just\nsuggested between Hilbert\u2019s method and Frege\u2019s proposal\nare that (i) it is not clear just what kind of language Frege has in\nmind, and (ii) it is not clear whether the class of terms Frege would\ncount as \u201clogical\u201d, i.e., the class whose members \u03bc\nmust map to themselves, is the same as the class of terms that Hilbert\nwould count as having a fixed interpretation. If Frege\u2019s class\nof fixed terms is wider than is Hilbert\u2019s, and/or Frege\u2019s\nlanguage lacks some of the terminology of Hilbert\u2019s, then a\ndemonstration of independence in Hilbert\u2019s sense will not imply\nthe existence of a mapping demonstrating independence in Frege\u2019s\nsense. One way to think of the crucial question is as the question\nwhether terms like \u201cnumber\u201d or \u201cbetween\u201d,\nterms that Frege treats as susceptible to conceptual analysis, will be\nallowed in the language that Frege is concerned with (as opposed, say,\nto requiring the language to contain only \u201cfully-analyzed\u201d\nterms), and whether such terms will be amongst those that \u03bc maps to\narbitrary new terminology. Frege himself notes the importance of the\nsecond terminological demarcation problem just raised, i.e., the\nproblem of determining which terms are mapped to themselves, and\nremarks that this problem is one that would need to be addressed in\norder to turn his sketch into a workable strategy. Because he never\nanswers the question of the fixed terminology or of the kind of\nlanguage in question, Frege\u2019s proposal is not sufficiently\ndeterminate for a clear comparison with Hilbert\u2019s. We are left,\nthen, with the interpretive issue of making sense of Frege\u2019s\nproposal of a method and subsequent apparent repudiation of it, while\nrecognizing the incomplete nature of that proposal.
