To explore women\u2019s use of pornography, feminist scholars\nhave studied soft-core pornographic genres that are marketed to women,\nsuch as pulp romance fiction (Radway 1991). Some have studied lesbian\npornography to challenge the idea that pornography always involves men\nsubordinating women (Ross 2000). In 1986, a group of feminists\npublished Caught Looking: Feminism, Pornography, and\nCensorship, which argues that feminists have targeted pornography\nout of frustration with their lack of progress in reducing violence\nagainst women. The book showcases a variety of pornographic imagery in\norder to illustrate the types of materials that may be restricted\nunder feminist-supported legal regulations (Duggan, Hunter, &\nVance 1986). In the introduction, Kate Ellis, Barbara O\u2019Dair and\nAbby Tallmer argue that\n\n\nthe feminist movement must not be drawn, in the name of protecting\nwomen, into the practice of censoring \u201cdeviant\u201d sexual\nrepresentation or expression \u2026 Women had to learn, with the\nsupport of other women, to articulate experiences that lay outside the\nproper sphere of the \u201cnice girl,\u201d to acknowledge our\nfantasies, and to be proud of our sexual choices \u2026 We must\nspeak out when we are victims, but also acknowledge what excites us,\nand support women who make their living providing that excitement to\nmen and to ourselves. (Ellis et al. 1986: 6)\n\n\nAnn Snitow advocates recentering feminist sexuality discussions on\n\u201cthe right to demand a sexuality more centered on female\npleasure\u201d, instead of focusing on controlling male sexuality\n(Snitow 1986: 11).\n\nIn Caught Looking, Lisa Duggan, Nan Hunter, and Carole Vance\nquestion the political strategies of anti-pornography feminists. They\nask \u201chow can feminists be entrusting the patriarchal state with\nthe task of legally distinguishing between permissible and\nimpermissible sexual images?\u201d (73). Any non-normative form of\nsexual expression, such as consensual BDSM or lesbian erotica, could\nbe targeted by MacKinnon/Dworkin style ordinances. Gayle Rubin\nelaborates\n\n\nThe scapegoating of pornography will create new problems, new forms of\nlegal and social abuse, and new modes of persecution. A responsible\nand progressive political movement has no business pursuing strategies\nthat will result in witch-hunts. (Rubin 1993: 38)\n\n\nDuggan, Hunter, and Vance provide three further reasons for opposing\nanti-pornography laws:\n\n\nfirst, the sexual images in question do not cause more harm than other\naspects of misogynist culture; second, sexually explicit speech, even\nin male-dominated society, serves positive social functions for women;\nand third, the passage and enforcement of antipornography laws such as\nthose supported in Minneapolis and Indiana are more likely to impede,\nrather than advance, feminist goals. (Duggan Hunter, & Vance 1986:\n80\u201381)\n\n\nDrucilla Cornell criticizes MacKinnon and Dworkin\u2019s model\nordinance for its tendency to enshrine an old stereotype of woman in\nthe law\u2014woman as vulnerable and in need of protection. She\nalleges that the ordinance approach relies on the law to enforce\nsocial norms and thus fails to struggle \u201cbeyond those symbolic\nforms that have been deeply inscribed in and by the structures of\ngender\u201d, as new forms of erotica sometimes do (Cornell 2000a:\n554).\n\nJudith Butler examines the role of fantasy in feminist politics and\nargues for maintaining conditions that permit diverse representations\nof women. Butler writes, \u201cfeminist theory relies on the capacity\nto postulate through fantasy a future that is not yet\u201d (Butler,\nJ. 2000: 487). According to Butler, antipornography feminists\nuncritically assume a representational realist ontology in which\n\u201cdepictions\u201d imitate and can causally disrupt some\npreexisting reality. Butler argues for a more complex understanding of\nthe relation between representations and their referents, focusing on\nhow representations can call into question the ontological status of\nentities and on how \u201cthe real\u201d is produced through social\naction. Curtailing representations will produce new forms of social\naction rather than protect some undisturbed, preferred version of\nreality. In Butler\u2019s words\n\n\ncertain kinds of efforts to restrict practices of representation in\nthe hopes of reigning in the imaginary, controlling the phantasmatic,\nend up reproducing and proliferating the phantasmatic in inadvertent\nways, indeed, in ways that contradict the intended purposes of the\nrestrictions itself. (Butler, J. 2000: 490)\n\n\nButler points out that efforts to censor homoerotic images have led to\ntheir greater production and exposure. She concludes that\n\n\nFeminist theory and politics cannot regulate the representation of\n\u201cwomen\u201d without producing that very\n\u201crepresentation\u201d: and if that is in some sense a\ndiscursive inevitability of representational politics, then the task\nmust be to safeguard the open productivity of those categories,\nwhatever the risk. (Butler, J. 2000: 503)\n\n\nButler concurs with feminists who hold that noxious speech can, in\nmost instances, be addressed through action that involves critical and\nthoughtful speech. For instance, disturbing depictions of \u201creal\nsex\u201d can be contested by insightful commentary and by new kinds\nof erotic imagery. Cornell develops this approach by arguing that\n\u201cPolitical action, not legal action, should be the main mode of\nintervention in the production of pornography\u201d (Cornell\n2000a: 551). By political action, Cornell means that feminists should\nform alliances with feminists in the pornography industry to create\nrepresentations of sexuality that will benefit women. Like Snitow,\nCornell argues that feminist activism should focus \u201con\nunleashing the feminine imaginary, rather than on constraining\nmen\u201d (Cornell 2000a: 553). Cornell examines the film and\nperformance work of Candida Royalle, Ona Zee, and Annie Sprinkle to\nshow how \u201cfemme\u201d and feminist pornography challenges the\nways that conventional pornography captures women and sex. Like\nButler, Cornell emphasizes the importance of fantasy for realizing\ntransformative feminist projects. She writes \u201cWithout new images\nand new words in which to express our sexuality, we will be unable to\ncreate a new world for women\u201d (Cornell 2000a: 564).\n\nAnne Eaton explores the production and marketing of feminist\npornography and argues that, just as conventional pornography shapes\nour erotic tastes in ways that reinforce patriarchal values, it can\nand should be co-opted for feminist purposes. Pornography can be\nproduced so that it eroticizes sexual practices and relationships that\nreflect egalitarian values (Eaton 2017; see also Stewart 2019). Robin\nZheng explores the work of women of color in the pornography industry,\nand considers the capacity of pornography to both reinforce and resist\nracist stereotypes and aesthetic values. Countering the arguments of\nthose who allege that risks of participating in the porn industry\noutweigh the benefits, Zheng writes \u201cif we must wait until the\npatriarchy is ... dismantled for morally pure sexual pleasures, then\nwe will be allowed no pleasures at all. Moreover, we will not be\nengaged in the sort of experimentation and play\u2014which, to be\nsure, may initially lead to more mistakes than successes\u2014that\nwill ultimately lead to the transformative pornography that feminists\nhave so longed for. While we can certainly critique particular\nelements and works of pornography, pornographies as market industries\nand forms of cultural production will continue to play an important\nrole in facilitating the development and cultivation of the active\nsexual selves that we wish to be\u2026\u201d (Zheng 2017).\n",
