How the Problems of Defining Biological Individuality Affect the Notion of Fitness\n \n\nIn previous sections, we remarked on the difficulty of identifying the\nprecise propensity that could, according to some, ground fitness\nascriptions. Moreover, it is often difficult to isolate the\npopulations where the evolutionary change is occurring. This is in\npart an operational problem, but for many biological systems, this\ndifficulty may in fact reveal a deeper ontological issue. Thinking\nabout fitness in reproductive terms depends on the possibility of\nidentifying offspring (or successive replicators) and populations of\nthem. For most Metazoans, this appears to be relatively\nstraightforward. But how are we to treat the evolution of colonies,\nclonal organisms and symbionts (and hypothetically ecosystems)? Many\nphilosophers have argued that our philosophy of biology\u2019s usual\nbestiary does not reflect some of the complex organisation actually to\nbe found in nature (J. Wilson 1999, D.S. Wilson and Sober 1989,\nGodfrey-Smith 2009, O\u2019Malley and Dupr\u00e9 2007, Bouchard and\nHuneman 2013) For many biological systems, organismal boundaries seem\narbitrary ways to carve up the biological world. Those boundaries may\nmerely reflect an impoverished way of thinking about biological\nindividuality (Pradeu 2012, Haber 2013). Many biological individuals\nare in fact complex arrangements of other individuals. When these\nindividuals belong to a single species (ex. some eusocial insects) a\ngene selectionist view according to which fitness is understood as the\ndifferential reproductive success of alleles may be available. But in\nthe case of multi-species communities (e.g., fungus-termite colonies),\nallelic success will not track evolutionary change since some of the\nadaptations are not fully biotic (Bouchard 2009). Moreover, it has\nbeen argued (Turner 2004, Bouchard 2004, 2008) that some individuals\nthat are adapting are not reproducing at all.\n \n\nBiological individuality is much more varied and heterogeneous than\npreviously believed and this additional complexity puts pressure on\nthe notion that reproductive success can act as a \u2018universal\ncurrency\u2019 of fitness. The difficulties of establishing\nreproductive success for some clonal organisms, for collectives of\norganisms and for multi-species assemblages has led some biologists\nand philosophers to entertain alternative concepts of fitness. Leigh\nVan Valen, in his attempts to develop a theory of evolution that would\nallow for the evolution of whole communities (Van Valen 1975, 1989,\n1991), suggested that fitness as energy control could explain the\nevolution of a broader range of biological systems. \u201cRather than\nsaying that natural selection is expected differential reproduction,\nwe should say that it is expected differential expansion\u201d (Van\nValen 1989, 7). By \u2018expansion\u2019 Van Valen doesn\u2019t\nmean expansion in physical space (although that may occur) but\nexpansion in resource or energy space. In this approach, energy is\nseen as the \u2018universal currency\u2019: a fitter community is\none that controls more energy than another community. For\n\u2018simpler\u2019 biological systems such as sexual species with\ndiscrete generations, increased reproductive success is a good proxy\nfor increased energy success and therefore previous measurements and\nmodels of reproductive output remain useful but their explanatory\nexhaustiveness is relativized. Although energy can seem to be a\nuniversal measure of fitness that could apply to the all the varied\ntypes of biological individuals that can emerge, it\u2019s not clear\nthat Van Valen\u2019s approach can be as universal as desired since\nit has difficulty explaining increases in efficiency in energy control\n(see Bouchard 2004 chap 3 for analysis). This has motivated Bouchard\n(2004, 2008, 2011) to argue for an account of evolution focusing on\ndifferential persistence (reminiscent of Thoday 1953). Bouchard (2004,\n2008, 2011) argues that Persistence Through Time of a lineage is the\nproperty maximized by evolution by natural selection: maximization of\nrelative reproductive success or maximization of energy control are\nonly two dominant strategies for persistence increase (see Bourrat\n2014 and Doolittle 2014 for related approaches). In this approach\n(lineage) \\(X\\)is fitter than (lineage) \\(Y\\) if \\(X\\)has a higher\npropensity to persist for \\(Z\\) amount of time than \\(Y\\). Some of the\nproblems of propensities remain, but we gain a way to assess\necological fitness (probability of persistence) in a way that can be\nindependent of reproductive success. Persistence is the overarching\ndesign-problem. Increased reproductive potential is but one powerful\nway to increase one\u2019s potential to persist.\n \n\nThe question of how to define biological individuality is an\nontological question about what individuals can evolve in response to\nnatural selection. Many biological systems differ in form and in\nfunction from our garden variety Metazoans. How are we to understand\nthe evolution of symbiotic communities involving bacteria with lateral\ngene transfer? How are we to make sense of the complex traits of\neusocial insects? Not all these emergent individuals qua individuals\nreplicate. Whether it\u2019s by focusing on energy or persistence (or\nsome other account) a complete understanding of fitness should reflect\nthat fact\u2014or accept that it cannot alone account for some\nadaptive change in the biological world.\n",
