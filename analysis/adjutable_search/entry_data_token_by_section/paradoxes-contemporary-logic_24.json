    "main_text": "A glance at present-day investigations || Staying non-classical\n6.6 Staying non-classical\n\nA number of solutions have been proposed, which rely on the use of\nparaconsistent logics (Priest) or substructural logics (see the entry\n logic: paraconsistent,\n as well as the entry\n substructural logics and\n Mares and Paoli 2014).\n\nThe investigation of semantical and set-theoretic paradoxes in\ninfinite-valued logic\u2014which was pioneered by Mow Shaw-Kwei 1954\nand Skolem in 1957 \u2014 has received a new impulse by contributions\nby Hajek, Shepherdson and Paris 2000, and Hajek 2005, 2010. Typically,\nin these papers basic results from mathematical analysis are\napplied (e.g. Brouwer\u2019s fixed point theorem). It is worth\nmentioning that Leitgeb 2008 has given a consistency proof for a\nprobabilistic theory of truth with unrestricted T-schema by\nmaking use of the Hahn-Banach Theorem. A follow-up of the latter\nsource that connects with researches related to the revision theory\n(see \u00a76.5), is Campbell-Moore, Horsten and Leitgeb 2019.\n\nTheories of naive truth\u2014as based on the unrestricted\nbiconditional and on a logic without contraction\u2014are to be found\nin the literature, e.g see Cantini 2002, Zardini 2011, Bacon 2013,\nStandefer 2016. Ripley 2012, instead, presents an alternative approach\nbased on a non-transitive logical system (see also Cobreros et al.\n2012, as well as Cobreros et al. 2015, which attempts at extending the\napproach to the paradoxes of vagueness).\n\nGri\u0161in 1981 proved that the system based upon the paradoxical\nprinciple par excellence\u2014the uniform na\u00efve\ncomprehension schema\u2014and (some form of) non-contractive logic\nenjoys cut elimination, and hence is consistent. On the other hand,\nthe consistency of the system is ruined by extensionality and this\ncould be counted as an additional paradox! Of course\n\u2018uniform\u2019 here means that a variable-binding abstraction\noperator {x | \u03c6(x,a)} for naming the\nset defined by \u03c6, depending on a list of given parameters\na, is available. Interestingly, it has been shown that\nclosely related systems have unexpected applications to the\ncharacterization of complexity classes (Girard 1998, Terui 2004); on\nthe other hand, the system is computationally complete (it\ncan interpret combinatory logic, Cantini 2003).\n",
