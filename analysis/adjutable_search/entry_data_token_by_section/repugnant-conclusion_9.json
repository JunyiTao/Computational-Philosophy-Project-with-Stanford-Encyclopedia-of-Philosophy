However, it has been\nsuggested that it is premature to conclude from this that the\nconclusion is morally unacceptable. Two sorts of reasons can be given\nin favor of the view that the conclusion should be accepted. According\nto the first, while it is correct that the conclusion is\ncounterintuitive, there are nevertheless certain theoretical\nconsiderations outweighing this intuition to such an extent that we\nshould accept it. The claim that no plausible theory can avoid the\nRepugnant Conclusion or that the rejection of the conclusion would\nforce one into rejecting claims which it is hard to get\naround\u2014e.g. such as the premises of the Mere Addition\nParadox\u2014may constitute such considerations (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\n2002; Holtug 2004; Huemer 2008). According to the second, the source\nof the unacceptability of the conclusion is the fact that we are\ndeluded by our intuition (Sikora 1978, 2004; Mackie 1985;\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1992, 1998, 2002; Hare 1993; Ryberg 1996a, 2004).\nOnce we fully understand what the conclusion amounts to, we will cease\nto find it counterintuitive. For instance, it might be suggested that\nthe repugnance, at least partly, is due to our limited apprehension of\nlarge numbers (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2002; Broome 2004). We cannot imagine\nwhat it would be like for there to exist billions upon billions of\npeople, and hence our intuition is not based on a sound picture of the\nmoral significance of population Z (for a critical discussion\nof these kind of arguments, see Temkin 2012 and Pummer 2013).\nMoreover, several theorists have suggested that our intuition is\nmisguided by a misapprehension of what it is like to lead a life in\nZ, i.e., a life that is barely worth living. The idea is that\nonce we realize that such a life is not terrible but perhaps a life\nnot much different from a normal privileged one, the conclusion loses\nits sting (Mackie 1985; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1992; Ryberg 1996a). Thus,\non both views, though population ethics may constitute a complicated\narea of ethical research, it is at least devoid of what is\ntraditionally regarded as one of the cardinal challenges.\n\nHowever, this conclusion might not be much of a comfort since there\nare other impossibility results that do not rely on avoidance of the\nRepugnant Conclusions as one of its adequacy condition but on\navoidance of the intuitively even more unacceptable Very Repugnant\nConclusion: For any perfectly equal population with very high positive\nwelfare, and for any number of lives with any very negative welfare,\nthere is a population consisting of the lives with negative welfare\nand lives with very low positive welfare which is better than the high\nwelfare population, other things being equal (Arrhenius 2011). This\nconclusion seems much harder to accept than the Repugnant Conclusions.\nHere we are comparing one population where everybody enjoys very high\nquality of life with another population where people either have very\nlow positive welfare or very negative welfare (any level of horrible\nsuffering). Even if we were to accept the Repugnant Conclusion, we are\nnot forced to accept the Very Repugnant Conclusion. We might, for\nexample, accept the former but not the latter because we give greater\nmoral weight to suffering than to happiness. Hence, to exorcise the\nparadoxes of population ethics, it is not sufficient to show that our\nintuition about the Repugnant Conclusion is wrong or epistemically\nunreliable. We also have to show that this is true of the Very\nRepugnant Conclusion, which might strike many as quite a tall\norder.\n",
