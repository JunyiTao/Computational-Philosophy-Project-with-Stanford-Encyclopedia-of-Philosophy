    "main_text": "\n\nWilhelm Dilthey was a German philosopher who lived from\n1833\u20131911. Dilthey is best known for the way he distinguished\nbetween the natural and human sciences. He defined the human sciences\nbroadly to include both the humanities and the social sciences.\nWhereas the main task of the natural sciences as Dilthey found them\nwas to arrive at law-based causal explanations, he projected the core\ntask of the human sciences to be that of providing an understanding of\nthe organizational structures and dynamic forces of human and\nhistorical life. It will be shown that this distinction is not so\nsharp as to rule out causal explanations in particular human sciences\nsuch as psychology, political theory, and economics; it mostly\ndelimits the scope of explanations in these fields. Dilthey\u2019s\naim was to expand Kant\u2019s primarily nature-oriented Critique\nof Pure Reason into a Critique of Historical Reason that\ncan also do justice to the social and cultural dimensions of human\nexperience. Understanding the meaning of human historical events\nrequires being able to organize them in their proper contexts and to\narticulate the structural uniformities that can be found in this way.\nDilthey\u2019s reflections on the human sciences, historical\ncontextualization, and hermeneutics influenced many subsequent\nthinkers such as Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer, Gadamer and Ricoeur.\nRecently, there has been some attention given to the ways in which\nDilthey\u2019s empirical approach to experience influenced Carnap in\nhis early attempts to overcome metaphysics in favor of more analytical\nmethods.\n",
