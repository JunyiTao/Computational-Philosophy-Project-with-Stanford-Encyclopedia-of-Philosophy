    "main_text": "Sufficient Conditions for Using Others Merely as Means || Possible Consent\n3.2 Possible Consent\n\nIn the passage on false promising, Kant references possible consent.\nHe suggests that the victim of the false promise cannot agree to the\nuse the false promisor is making of him. We might conclude that the\nvictim cannot agree on the grounds that he cannot share the\npromisor\u2019s end; for it would, in the sense invoked above\n (\u00a73.1.3),\n be practically irrational for him to pursue this end. There is,\nhowever, another way of interpreting the victim\u2019s inability to\nconsent in the context of considering candidates for a plausible\nsufficient condition for an agent\u2019s treating another merely as a\nmeans. Another account, prompted by the Groundwork passage,\nis this: An agent uses another merely as a means if the other cannot\nconsent to her use of him (O\u2019Neill 1989:\n 113).[7]\n An agent cannot consent to being treated as a means if he does not\nhave the ability to avert his being treated as such by dissenting,\nthat is, by withholding his agreement to\n it.[8]\n If an agent deceives or coerces another, then the other\u2019s\ndissent is \u201cin principle ruled out\u201d (1989: 111) and thus\nso is his consent. Suppose, for example, that an appliance\nserviceperson tricks a customer into authorizing an expensive repair.\nThe customer does not really have the opportunity to dissent to the\nperson\u2019s action by refusing to give his consent to it. For he\ndoes not know what her action is, namely one of lying to him about\nwhat is wrong with his refrigerator. (If he did know what her action\nwas, then he would not be deceived.) Or suppose that a mugger\napproaches you on a dark street, points a gun at you, and tells you\nthat unless you give him all of your money, he will hurt you. He\nleaves you no opportunity to avert his use of you by withholding your\nconsent. Regardless of what you say, he is presumably going to use\nyou, whether it is through your handing over your wallet or his\nviolently taking it from you. Since you cannot consent to his action,\nthe mugger is treating you merely as a\n means.[9]\n\nThe account is subject to objections. It does not suffice for an agent\nto treat another merely as a means that the other simply be\nunable to consent to the way he is being used, some argue. If it did\nsuffice, then a passerby giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to\na collapsed jogger would be treating the jogger merely as a means and\nthus acting wrongly. But the passerby does not seem to be doing\nanything that is morally impermissible.\n\nIn light of this objection, someone might propose a different account:\nSuppose an agent uses another. She uses him merely as a means if\nsomething she has done or is doing to the other renders him\nunable to consent to her using him. Of course, although the collapsed\njogger has no opportunity to consent to the passerby\u2019s giving\nhim CPR, the passerby has not put him in that position. So this\naccount avoids the unwelcome implication that the passerby treats the\ncollapsed jogger merely as a means.\n\nHowever, this account is also open to objection. First, it fails to\ndesignate as such some cases that we, intuitively speaking, would\nsurely classify as treating others merely as means (Kerstein 2013:\n74). Think for example of a case where one person knocks someone out\nwith a \u201cdate rape\u201d drug. Another person, who had no\nknowledge of or involvement in drugging the victim, sexually assaults\nhim. Since this other person has not rendered the victim unable to\nconsent to his use of him, the account does not yield the conclusion\nthat he treats him merely as a means.\n\nThe account arguably not only fails to capture some cases of an\nagent\u2019s treating another merely as a means, but also designates\nas such some cases of deception that, intuitively speaking, are not.\nFor example, in order to make your spouse\u2019s birthday party a\nsurprise for her, you need to lie to your sister-in-law about your\nwhereabouts during a certain afternoon. You use her to quell your\nspouse\u2019s suspicions regarding your plans. As you realize, if you\ntold your sister-in-law about the party, she would be unable to keep\nthe secret from your spouse. According to the account, you treat your\nsister-in-law merely as a means, since your deception leaves her with\nno opportunity to avert your use of her. This conclusion seems\nquestionable to some, albeit not to others. Here is another case of\nwhat some think of as morally permissible deception (Parfit 2011:\n178). Suppose that, in order to save the life of an innocent witness\nto a crime, you use her to pass on a lie you have told her to the\nperpetrator, Brown. If Brown did not believe the lie, he would kill\nthe witness. You realize that if you let the witness in on what was\nnecessary to save her life and told her to lie to Brown herself, she\nwould not be able to do so effectively. Your treatment of the person\nrenders impossible her consent to your use of her. But it is\nimplausible to conclude that you are treating her merely as a means,\nsome insist.\n\nIn these two cases, it makes sense to think that the person you are\nusing can share your ends, in the sense specified in\n \u00a73.1.3.\n Your sister-in-law can share the end of your spouse not getting\nsuspicious regarding a surprise party, and, of course, the witness can\nshare the end of Brown\u2019s coming to believe some lie. Perhaps\nthat is why in these cases the person\u2019s inability to consent to\nyour use of her seems to fall short of plausibly implying that you are\nusing her merely as a means.\n",
