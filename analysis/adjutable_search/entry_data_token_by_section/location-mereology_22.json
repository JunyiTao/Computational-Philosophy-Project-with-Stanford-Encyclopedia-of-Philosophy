    "main_text": "Multilocation || Against Multilocation #3: from Change\n6.6 Against Multilocation #3: from Change\n\nExtended simples face a problem arising from qualitative variation.\nMultilocated entities face a similar problem. One might think that if\nmultilocation is possible, then there should be a possible situation\ninvolving a thing o1 exactly located at a region\nr1 and a thing o2 exactly located\nat a disjoint region r2, such that\no1 is white, o2 is grey, and\no1=o2. (Again, change in color is\njust a placeholder.) Since it's impossible for a single thing to be\nboth white and grey, one might continue, no such situation is\npossible. This might lead one to conclude that multilocation itself is\nimpossible.\n\nFriends of multilocation reject the initial (conditional) premise,\nthough not always for the same reason. Some say that multilocation is\npossible but only for entities, such as universals or tropes, that do\nnot vary qualitatively between locations. Others say that\nmultilocation is possible even for entities that do vary between\nlocations. These philosophers can choose among the roughly same range\nof options that were available to friends of heterogeneous extended\nsimples, including the relativizing approach, the stuff-theoretic\napproach, and distributional\n properties.[13]\n\nFor further arguments against multilocation, see Section 3.3 of the\nsupplementary document\n Additional Arguments.\n",
