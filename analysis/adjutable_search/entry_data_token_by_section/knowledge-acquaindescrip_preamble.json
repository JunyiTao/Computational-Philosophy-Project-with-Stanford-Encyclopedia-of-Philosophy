    "main_text": "\n\nThe terminology is most clearly associated with Bertrand Russell, but\nthe distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by\ndescription is arguably a critical component of classical or\ntraditional versions of foundationalism. Let us say that one has\ninferential or nonfoundational knowledge that p when\none\u2019s knowledge that p depends on one\u2019s knowledge\nof some other proposition(s) from which one can legitimately infer\np; and one has foundational or noninferential knowledge that\np when one\u2019s knowledge that p does not depend\non any other knowledge one has in this way. According to\nfoundationalism regarding knowledge, we have some foundational\nknowledge, and any nonfoundational or inferential knowledge that we\nhave depends, ultimately, on this foundational knowledge. What\ndistinguishes classical foundationalism (or at least a prominent\nversion of classical foundationalism) about knowledge is the\ninsistence that all foundational knowledge is knowledge by\nacquaintance. \n\nHistorically, the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description is made between two kinds of\nknowledge. However, after a brief discussion of\nRussell\u2019s presentation of the distinction, we follow the\ncontemporary literature in focusing more on the role of acquaintance\nin securing justified or rational belief. (See the\nentry on\n epistemology\n for more on the relation between knowledge and justification.) This\nis important both because doing so can illuminate the role that\nacquaintance plays in securing knowledge (which arguably requires\njustified belief) and because we may be interested in its role as a\nsource of justification even when we fall short of knowledge. Let us\nsay that one has an inferentially justified belief that p\nwhen one\u2019s belief that p depends for its justification\non justified belief in some other proposition(s) from which one can\nlegitimately infer p; and one has a foundationally or\nnoninferentially justified belief that p when one\u2019s\nbelief that p is justified but does not depend on any other\nbeliefs for its justification. According to foundationalism regarding\njustification, we have some foundationally justified beliefs, and all\nother justified beliefs must depend for their justification on\nfoundationally justified beliefs. Classical versions of\nfoundationalism about justification hold that foundational beliefs are\njustified by acquaintance. (See the entry on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification\n for more on foundationalism.) As we shall see, proponents of\nclassical foundationalism typically ascribe other important\nphilosophical roles to acquaintance.\n",
