    "main_text": "Contemporary Pragmatic Theory || A Theory of Utterance-Type-Meaning\n3.3 A Theory of Utterance-Type-Meaning\n\nTogether with Horn\u2019s (1984, 1989, 2004), Levinson\u2019s work\n(2000) is a good representative of grammar-oriented pragmatics.\nLevinson is only marginally a neo-Gricean. He is not committed to\nGrice\u2019s fundamental two-fold division between what is said, on\nthe one hand, and implicatures, on the other \u2014 he proposes a\nthird level of default or preferred interpretation. He does not\nprovide a theory of utterance comprehension based primarily on\nrecognition of communicative intentions, for default interpretations\nare not concerned with that. However, he does assume conversational\nprinciples and maxims, formulating a series of heuristics, inspired by\nGrice\u2019s maxims, for a theory of Generalized Conversational\nImplicatures (GCIs) that, as important as they were in Grice\u2019s\nprogram, have been neglected by many post-Gricean authors.\nLevinson\u2019s GCI theory is not a philosophical theory of human\ncommunication, nor a psychological theory of utterance understanding,\nbut a partial theory of utterance-type meaning with its focus on\nlinguistics. As he puts it:\n\nIn the composite theory of meaning, the theory of GCIs plays just a\nsmall role in a general theory of communication\u2026 It is just to\nlinguistic theory that GCIs have an unparalleled import.\n(Levinson 2000, pp. 21\u201322.)\n\n\nThe two-layered view of utterance content consisting, according to\nLevinson, of a level of encoded meaning (sentence-meaning)\nand a level of inferential meaning (speaker\u2019s or\nutterance-(token)-meaning), must be supplemented by a third\nintermediate layer of utterance-type-meaning which is not\nbased \u201con direct computations on speaker-intentions but rather\non general expectations about how language is normally used\u201d (p.\n22).\n\nThese expectations are formulated by Levinson as a series of\nheuristics, that have a clear connection with Grice\u2019s maxims of\nquantity and manner:\n\nFirst (Q) Heuristic: What isn\u2019t said, isn\u2019t\n(i.e., what you do not say is not the case)\n\n\nThis is related to Grice\u2019s first maxim of quantity (\u201cMake\nyour contribution as informative as required\u201d) and is held\nresponsible for the inference of so-called scalar implicatures, among\nothers. So from an utterance of \u201cSome students came to the\nparty\u201d it is inferable by default that not all the students\ncame. It is not part of the meaning of \u2018some,\u2019 yet, in\ngeneral \u2014 by default from the utterance-type \u2014 it is what\none would infer in absence of evidence to the contrary. In this case,\nthe heuristic has to be restricted to a set of alternates in a\n\u2018scale,\u2019 so that the use of one implicates the\nnon-applicability of the other.\n\nSecond (I) Heuristic: What is expressed simply is\nstereotypically exemplified\n\n\nThis is related to Grice\u2019s second maxim of quantity (\u201cDo\nnot make your contribution more informative than necessary\u201d),\nand is taken to be involved in cases of interpretation of conditionals\nas bi-conditionals, the enrichment of conjunctions with the expression\nof temporal and causal relations among the conjuncts,\n\u2018bridging\u2019 inferences, collective reading of plural noun\nphrases, and so on.\n\nThird (M) Heuristic: What is said in an abnormal way,\nisn\u2019t normal (i.e., marked message indicates marked situation)\n\n\nThis heuristic is related to Grice\u2019s maxim of manner and,\nspecially, to the first submaxim (\u201cAvoid obscurity of\nexpression\u201d) and the fourth (\u201cAvoid prolixity\u201d). If\naccording to the second heuristic an unmarked utterance gives rise to\na stereotypical interpretation, now we have that this interpretation\nis overruled if a marked utterance is produced. One of the clearest\nexamples is double negation versus simple positive assertion. Compare\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible the plane will be late\u201d with\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that the plane will be\nlate.\u201d\n\nWhen conflict among these three heuristics arise, Levinson argues that\nthese are resolved in the following way: Q defeats\nM, and M defeats I.\n",
