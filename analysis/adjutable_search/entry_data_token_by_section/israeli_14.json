    "main_text": "Philosophical Works, Manuscripts and Translations\n5. Philosophical Works, Manuscripts and Translations\n\nAll of the following works, except the Book on the Elements,\nhave been translated by Alexander Altmann and S. M. Stern in their\nmonograph Isaac Israeli: A Neoplatonic Philosopher of the Early\nTenth Century. In the 1950s and 1960s these two scholars have\nalso published transcriptions of the fragments and manuscripts of\nthese works in a number of journals. In addition to publishing and\ntranslating known works of Isaac Israeli, Altmann and Stern firmly\nestablished the hypothesis suggested by Gershom Scholem that Isaac\nIsraeli authored a work previously erroneously attributed to\nAristotle: The Chapter on the Elements (Mantua Text).\nFurther, in their extensive analyses of Israeli\u2019s texts (in\nwhich they often compare Israeli\u2019s text to parallel passages in\nal-Kindi and other authors), they established the surprising antiquity\nof the Neoplatonic treatise which Abraham Ibn Hasday (d. 1240)\nappended to his Hebrew translation of The Prince and the\nAscetic. This work, which they dubbed \u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s\nNeoplatonist\u201d actually predated and influenced both Isaac\nIsraeli and the Longer Recension of the Theology of\nAristotle, and Stern\u2019s article on \u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s\nNeoplatonist\u201d is an important component of any thorough study of\nthe philosophy of Isaac Israeli.\n",
