Introduction\n\nThere are two competing mathematical strategies that are used in\nconnection with physical theory; one emphasizes rigor and the other\npragmatics. The pragmatic approach often compromises mathematical\nrigor, but offers instead expediency of calculation and elegance of\nexpression. A case in point is the notion of an infinitesimal, a\nnon-zero quantity that is smaller than any finite quantity.\nInfinitesimals were used by Kepler, Galileo, Newton, Leibniz and many\nothers in developing and using their respective physical theories,\ndespite lacking a mathematically rigorous foundation, as Berkeley\nclearly showed in his famous 1734 treatise The Analyst\ncriticizing infinitesimals. Such criticisms did not prevent various\n18th Century mathematicians, scientists, and engineers such as Euler\nand Lagrange from using infinitesimals to get accurate answers from\ntheir calculations. Nevertheless, the pull towards rigor led to the\ndevelopment in the 19th century of the concept of a limit by Cauchy\nand others, which provided a rigorous mathematical framework that\neffectively replaced the theory of infinitesimals. A rigorous\nfoundation was eventually provided for infinitesimals by Robinson\nduring the second half of the 20th Century, but infinitesimals are\nrarely used in contemporary physics. For more on the history of\ninfinitesimals, see the entry on\n continuity and infinitesimals.\n\nThe competing mathematical strategies are manifest in a more recent\ndiscussion concerning the mathematical foundations of quantum\nmechanics. In the preface to von Neumann\u2019s (1955) treatise on\nthat topic, he notes that Dirac provides a very elegant and powerful\nformal framework for quantum mechanics, but complains about the\ncentral role in that framework of an \u201cimproper function with\nself-contradictory properties,\u201d which he also characterizes as a\n\u201cmathematical fiction.\u201d He is referring to the Dirac\n\\(\\delta\\) function, which has the following incompatible properties:\nit is defined over the real line, is zero everywhere except for one\npoint at which it is infinite, and yields unity when integrated over\nthe real line. Von Neumann promotes an alternative framework, which he\ncharacterizes as being \u201cjust as clear and unified, but without\nmathematical objections.\u201d He emphasizes that his framework is\nnot merely a refinement of Dirac\u2019s; rather, it is a radically\ndifferent framework that is based on Hilbert\u2019s theory of\noperators.\n\nDirac is of course fully aware that the \\(\\delta\\) function is not a\nwell-defined expression. But he is not troubled by this for two\nreasons. First, as long as one follows the rules governing the\n\\(\\delta\\) function (such as using the \\(\\delta\\) function only under\nan integral sign, meaning in part not asking the value of a \\(\\delta\\)\nfunction at a given point), then no inconsistencies will arise.\nSecond, the \\(\\delta\\) function can be eliminated, meaning that it can\nbe replaced with a well-defined mathematical expression. However, the\ndrawback in that case is, according to Dirac, that the substitution\nleads to a more cumbersome expression that obscures the argument. In\nshort, when pragmatics and rigor lead to the same conclusion,\npragmatics trumps rigor due to the resulting simplicity, efficiency,\nand increase in understanding.\n\nAs in the case of the notion of an infinitesimal, the Dirac \\(\\delta\\)\nfunction was eventually given a mathematically rigorous foundation.\nThat was done within Schwartz\u2019s theory of distributions, which\nwas later used in developing the notion of a rigged Hilbert space. The\ntheory of distributions was used to provide a mathematical framework\nfor quantum field theory (Wightman 1964). The rigged Hilbert space was\nused to do so for quantum mechanics (B\u00f6hm 1966) and then for\nquantum field theory (Bogoluliubov et al. 1975).\n\nThe complementary approaches, rigor and pragmatics, which are\nexhibited in the development of quantum mechanics, later came about in\na more striking way in connection with the development of quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) and, more generally, quantum field theory (QFT).\nThe emphasis on rigor emerges in connection with two frameworks,\nalgebraic QFT and Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. Algebraic QFT has\nits roots in the work of von Neumann on operator algebras, which was\ndeveloped by him in an attempt to generalize the Hilbert space\nframework. Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT has its roots in\nSchwartz\u2019s theory of distributions, and it was later developed\nin the rigged Hilbert space framework. Roughly, the basic distinction\nbetween the two approaches is that the algebra of operators is the\nbasic mathematical concept in algebraic QFT, while operator-valued\ndistributions (the quantum analogues of field quantities) are\nfundamental in Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. It is worth noting that\nalgebraic QFT is generally formulated axiomatically, and that it is\njust as deserving of the name \u201caxiomatic\u201d QFT. However,\nthat term is often taken to refer specifically to the approach based\non operator-valued distributions. To avoid any possible confusion,\nthat approach is referred to here as \u201cWightman\u2019s\naxiomatic\u201d QFT. The emphasis on pragmatics arises most notably\nin Lagrangian QFT, which uses perturbation theory, path integrals, and\nrenormalization techniques. Although some elements of the theory were\neventually placed on a firmer mathematical foundation, there are still\nserious questions about its being a fully rigorous approach on a par\nwith algebraic and Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. Nevertheless, it\nhas been spectacularly successful in providing numerical results that\nare exceptionally accurate with respect to experimentally determined\nquantities, and in making possible expedient calculations that are\nunrivaled by other approaches.\n\nThe two approaches to QFT continue to develop in parallel. Fleming\n(2002, pp. 135\u2013136) brings this into focus in his discussion of\ndifferences between Haag\u2019s Local Quantum Physics (1996)\nand Weinberg\u2019s Quantum Field Theory (1995);\nHaag\u2019s book presents algebraic QFT, and Weinberg\u2019s book\npresents Lagrangian QFT. While both books are ostensibly about the\nsame subject, Haag gives a precise formulation of QFT and its\nmathematical structure, but does not provide any techniques for\nconnecting with experimentally determined quantities, such as\nscattering cross sections. Weinberg gives a pragmatic formulation that\nengages with physical intuition and provides heuristics that are\nimportant for performing calculations; however, it is not as\nmathematically rigorous. Moreover, there are a number of important\ntopics that are examined in one book while not even mentioned in the\nother. For example, unitarily inequivalent representations are\ndiscussed by Haag, but not by Weinberg. By contrast, Weinberg\ndiscusses Feynman\u2019s rules for path integrals, which are not\nmentioned at all by Haag. There is also the issue of demographics.\nMost particle and experimental physicists will read and study\nWeinberg\u2019s book, but very few will read Haag\u2019s book.\nBecause of these differences, Fleming (2002, p. 136) suggests that one\nmight question whether the two books are really about the same\nsubject. This gives rise to the question whether any formulation of\nQFT is worthy of philosophical attention to its foundations. In\nparticular, there is a debate between Wallace (2006, 2011) and Fraser\n(2009, 2011) over whether an interpretation of QFT should be based on\nthe standard textbook treatment of QFT or an axiomatic formulation of\nQFT.\n2. Von Neumann and the Foundations of Quantum Theory\n\nIn the late 1920s, von Neumann developed the separable Hilbert space\nformulation of quantum mechanics, which later became the definitive\none (from the standpoint of mathematical rigor, at least). In the\nmid-1930s, he worked extensively on lattice theory (see the entry on\n quantum logic),\n rings of operators, and continuous geometries. Part of his expressed\nmotivation for developing these mathematical theories was to develop\nan appropriate framework for QFT and a better foundation for quantum\nmechanics. During this time, he noted two closely related structures,\nmodular lattices and finite type-II factors (a special type of ring of\noperators), that have what he regarded as desirable features for\nquantum theory. These observations led to his developing a more\ngeneral framework, continuous geometries, for quantum theory. Matters\ndid not work out as von Neumann had expected. He soon realized that\nsuch geometries must have a transition probability function, if they\nare to be used to describe quantum mechanical phenomena, and that the\nresulting structure is not a generalization at all beyond the operator\nrings that were already available. Moreover, it was determined much\nlater that the type-III factors are the most important type of ring of\noperators for quantum theory. In addition, a similar verdict was\ndelivered much later with regards to his expectations concerning\nlattice theory. The lattices that are appropriate for quantum theory\nare orthomodular \u2013 a lattice is orthomodular only if it is\nmodular, but the converse is false. Of the three mathematical\ntheories, it is the rings of operators that have proven to be the most\nimportant framework for quantum theory. It is possible to use a ring\nof operators to model key features of physical systems in a purely\nabstract, algebraic setting (this is discussed in section 4.1). A\nrelated issue concerns whether it is necessary to choose a\nrepresentation of the ring in a Hilbert space; see Haag and Kastler\n(1964), Ruetsche (2003), and Kronz and Lupher (2005) for further\ndiscussion of this issue. In any case, the separable Hilbert space\nremains a crucial framework for quantum theory. The simplest examples\nof separable Hilbert spaces are the finite dimensional ones, in which\ncase the algebra of operators is a type-I\\(_n\\) factor (n is a\npositive integer). The operators are n-by-n complex matrices, which\nare typically used to describe internal degrees of freedom such as\nspin. Readers wanting to familiarize themselves with these basic\nexamples should consult the entry on\n quantum mechanics.\n2.1 The Separable Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\n\nMatrix mechanics and wave mechanics were formulated roughly around the\nsame time between 1925 and 1926. In July 1925, Heisenberg finished his\nseminal paper \u201cOn a Quantum Theoretical Interpretation of\nKinematical and Mechanical Relations\u201d. Two months later, Born\nand Jordan finished their paper, \u201cOn Quantum Mechanics\u201d,\nwhich is the first rigorous formulation of matrix mechanics. Two\nmonths after this, Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan finished \u201cOn\nQuantum Mechanics II\u201d, which is an elaboration of the earlier\nBorn and Jordan paper; it was published in early 1926. These three\npapers are reprinted in van der Waerden (1967). Meanwhile,\nSchr\u00f6dinger was working on what eventually became his four famous\npapers on wave mechanics. The first was received by Annalen der\nPhysik in January 1926, the second was received in February, and\nthen the third in May and the fourth in June. All four are reprinted\nin Schr\u00f6dinger (1928).\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger was the first to raise the question of the\nrelationship between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics in\nSchr\u00f6dinger (1926), which was published in Annalen in\nspring 1926 between the publication of his second and third papers of\nthe famous four. This paper is also reprinted in Schr\u00f6dinger\n(1928). It contains the germ of a mathematical equivalence proof, but\nit does not contain a rigorous proof of equivalency: the mathematical\nframework that Schr\u00f6dinger associated with wave mechanics is a\nspace of continuous and normalizable functions, which is too small to\nestablish the appropriate relation with matrix mechanics. Shortly\nthereafter, Dirac and Jordan independently provided a unification of\nthe two frameworks. But their respective approaches required essential\nuse of \\(\\delta\\) functions, which were suspect from the standpoint of\nmathematical rigor. In 1927, von Neumann published three papers in\nG\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten that placed quantum mechanics on a\nrigorous mathematical foundation and included a rigorous proof (i.e.,\nwithout the use of \\(\\delta\\) functions) of the equivalence of matrix\nand wave mechanics. These papers are reprinted in von\nNeumann(1961\u20131963, Volume I, Numbers 8\u201310). In the preface\nto his famous 1932 treatise on quantum mechanics (von Neumann 1955),\nwhich is an elegant summary of the separable Hilbert space formulation\nof quantum mechanics that he provided in the earlier papers, he\nacknowledges the simplicity and utility of Dirac\u2019s formulation\nof quantum mechanics, but finds it ultimately unacceptable. He\nindicates that he cannot endure the use of what could then only be\nregarded as mathematical fictions. Examples of these fictions include\nDirac\u2019s assumption that every self-adjoint operator can be put\nin diagonal form and his use of \\(\\delta\\) functions, which von\nNeumann characterizes as \u201cimproper functions with\nself-contradictory properties\u201d. His stated purpose is to\nformulate a framework for quantum mechanics that is mathematically\nrigorous.\n\nWhat follows is a brief sketch of von Neumann\u2019s strategy. First,\nhe recognized the mathematical framework of matrix mechanics as what\nwould now be characterized as an infinite dimensional, separable\nHilbert space. Here the term\u00a0\u201cHilbert space\u201d denotes\na complete vector space with an inner product; von Neumann imposed the\nadditional requirement of separability (having a countable basis) in\nhis definition of a Hilbert space. He then attempted to specify a set\nof functions that would instantiate an (infinite-dimensional)\nseparable Hilbert space and could be identified with\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave mechanics. He began with the space of\nsquare-integrable functions on the real line. To satisfy the\ncompleteness condition, that all Cauchy sequences of functions\nconverge (in the mean) to some function in that space, he specified\nthat integration must be defined in the manner of Lebesgue. To define\nan inner product operation, he specified that the set of Lebesgue\nsquare-integrable functions must be partitioned into equivalence\nclasses modulo the relation of differing on a set of measure zero.\nThat the elements of the space are equivalence classes of functions\nrather than functions is sometimes overlooked, and it has interesting\nramifications for interpretive investigations. It has been argued in\nKronz (1999), for example, that separable Hilbert space is not a\nsuitable framework for quantum mechanics under Bohm\u2019s\nontological interpretation (also known as\n Bohmian mechanics).\n2.2 Rings of Operators, Quantum Logics, and Continuous Geometries\n\nIn a letter to Birkhoff from 1935, von Neumann says: \u201cI would\nlike to make a confession which may seem immoral: I do not believe in\nHilbert space anymore\u201d; the letter is published in von Neumann\n(2005). The confession is indeed startling since it comes from the\nchampion of the separable Hilbert space formulation of quantum\nmechanics and it is issued just three years after the publication of\nhis famous treatise, the definitive work on the subject. The irony is\ncompounded by the fact that less than two years after his confession\nto Birkhoff, his mathematical theorizing about the abstract\nmathematical structure that was to supersede the separable Hilbert\nspace, continuous geometries with a transition probability, turned out\nnot to provide a generalization of the separable Hilbert space\nframework. It is compounded again with interest in that subsequent\ndevelopments in mathematical physics initiated and developed by von\nNeumann ultimately served to strengthen the entrenchment of the\nseparable Hilbert space framework in mathematical physics (especially\nwith regards to quantum theory). These matters are explained in more\ndetail in Section 4.1.\n\nThree theoretical developments come together for von Neumann in his\ntheory of continuous geometries during the seven years following 1932:\nthe algebraic approach to quantum mechanics, quantum logics, and rings\nof operators. By 1934, von Neumann had already made substantial moves\ntowards an algebraic approach to quantum mechanics with the help of\nJordan and Wigner \u2013 their article, \u201cOn an Algebraic\nGeneralization of the Quantum Mechanical Formalism\u201d,\u00a0 is\nreprinted in von Neumann (1961\u20131963, Vol. II, No. 21). In 1936,\nhe published a second paper on this topic, \u201cOn an Algebraic\nGeneralization of the\u00a0 Quantum Mechanical Formalism (Part\nI)\u201d, which is reprinted in von Neumann (1961\u20131963, Vol.\nIII, No. 9). Neither work was particularly influential, as it turns\nout. A related paper by von Neumann and Birkhoff, \u201cThe Logic of\nQuantum Mechanics\u201d, was also published in 1936, and it is\nreprinted in von Neumann (1961\u20131963, Vol. IV, No. 7). It was\nseminal to the development of a sizeable body of literature on\n quantum logics.\n It should be noted, however, that this happens only after modularity,\na key postulate for von Neumann, is replaced with orthomodularity (a\nweaker condition). The nature of the shift is clearly explained in\nHolland (1970): modularity is in effect a weakening of the\ndistributive laws (limiting their validity to certain selected triples\nof lattice elements), and orthomodularity is a weakening of modularity\n(limiting the validity of the distributive laws to an even smaller set\nof triples of lattice elements). The shift from modularity to\northomodularity was first made in (Loomis 1955). Rapid growth of\nliterature on orthomodular lattices and the foundations of quantum\nmechanics soon followed. For example, see Pavi\u010di\u0107 (1992) for\na fairly exhaustive bibliography of quantum logic up to 1990, which\nhas over 1800 entries.\n\nOf substantially greater note for the foundations of quantum theory\nare six papers by von Neumann (three jointly published with Murray) on\nrings of operators, which are reprinted in von Neumann\n(1961\u20131963, Vol. III, Nos 2\u20137). The first two, \u201cOn\nRings of Operators\u201d and a sequel \u201cOn Rings of Operators\nII\u201d, were published in 1936 and 1937, and they were seminal to\nthe development of the other four. The third, \u201cOn Rings of\nOperators: Reduction Theory\u201d, was written during 1937\u20131938\nbut not published until 1949. The fourth, \u201cOn Infinite Direct\nProducts\u201d, was published in 1938. The remaining two, \u201cOn\nRings of Operators III\u201d and \u201cOn Rings of Operators\nIV\u201d were published in 1941 and 1943, respectively. This massive\nwork on rings of operators was very influential and continues to have\nan impact in pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and the\nfoundations of physics. Rings of operators are now referred to as\n\u201cvon Neumann algebras\u201d following Dixmier (1981), who first\nreferred to them by this name (stating that he did so following a\nsuggestion made to him by Dieudonn\u00e9) in the introduction to his\n1957 treatise on operator algebras (Dixmier 1981).\n\nA von Neumann algebra is a \\(*\\)-subalgebra of the set\nof bounded operators B(H) on a Hilbert space H that is closed in the\nweak operator topology. It is usually assumed that the von Neumann\nalgebra contains the identity operator. A \\(*\\)-subalgebra\ncontains the adjoint of every operator in\nthe algebra, where the \u201c\\(*\\)\u201d denotes the\nadjoint. There are special types of von Neumann algebras that are\ncalled \u201cfactors\u201d. A von Neumann algebra is a factor, if\nits center (which is the set of elements that commute with all\nelements of the algebra) is trivial, meaning that it only contains\nscalar multiples of the identity element. Moreover, von Neumann showed\nin his reduction-theory paper that all von Neumann algebras that are\nnot factors can be decomposed as a direct sum (or integral) of\nfactors. There are three mutually exclusive and exhaustive factor\ntypes: type-I, type-II, and type-III. Each type has been classified\ninto (mutually exclusive and exhaustive) sub-types: types I\\(_n\\) \\((n\n= 1,2,\\ldots ,\\infty),\\) II\\(_n\\) \\((n = 1,\\infty),\\) III\\(_z\\)\n\\((0\\le z\\le 1).\\) As mentioned above, type-I\\(_n\\) correspond to\nfinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, while type-I\\(_{\\infty}\\)\ncorresponds to the infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space that\nprovides the rigorous framework for wave and matrix mechanics. Von\nNeumann and Murray distinguished the subtypes for type-I and type-II,\nbut were not able to do so for the type-III factors. Subtypes were not\ndistinguished for these factors until the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 see\nChapter 3 of Sunder (1987) or Chapter 5 of Connes (1994) for\ndetails.\n\nAs a result of his earlier work on the foundations of quantum\nmechanics and his work on quantum logic with Birkhoff, von Neumann\ncame to regard the type-II\\(_1\\) factors as likely to be the most\nrelevant for physics. This is a substantial shift since the most\nimportant class of algebra of observables for quantum mechanics was\nthought at the time to be the set of bounded operators on an\ninfinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space, which is a\ntype-I\\(_{\\infty}\\) factor. A brief explanation for this shift is\nprovided below. See the well-informed and lucid account presented in\n(R\u00e9dei 1998) for a much fuller discussion of von\nNeumann\u2019s views on fundamental connections between quantum\nlogic, rings of operators (particularly type-II\\(_1\\) factors),\nfoundations of probability theory, and quantum physics. It is worth\nnoting that von Neumann regarded the type-III factors as a catch-all\nclass for the \u201cpathological\u201d operator algebras; indeed, it\ntook several years after the classificatory scheme was introduced to\ndemonstrate the existence of such factors. It is ironic that the\npredominant view now seems to be that the type-III factors are the\nmost relevant class for physics (particularly for QFT and quantum\nstatistical mechanics). This point is elaborated further in Section\n4.1 after explaining below why von Neumann\u2019s program never came\nto fruition.\n\nIn the introduction to the first paper in the series of four entitled\n\u201cOn Rings of Operators\u201d, Murray and von Neumann list two\nreasons why they are dissatisfied with the separable Hilbert space\nformulation of quantum mechanics. One has to do with a property of the\ntrace operation, which is the operation appearing in the definition of\nthe probabilities for measurement results (the Born rule), and the\nother with domain problems that arise for unbounded observable\noperators. The trace of the identity is infinite when the separable\nHilbert space is infinite-dimensional, which means that it is not\npossible to define a correctly normalized a priori\nprobability for the outcome of an experiment (i.e., a measurement of\nan observable). By definition, the a priori probability for\nan experiment is that in which any two distinct outcomes are equally\nlikely. Thus, the probability must be zero for each distinct outcome\nwhen there is an infinite number of such outcomes, which can occur if\nand only if the space is infinite dimensional. It is not clear why von\nNeumann believed that it is necessary to have an a priori\nprobability for every experiment, especially since von Mises clearly\nbelieved that a priori probabilities (\u201cuniform\ndistributions\u201d in his terminology) do not always exist (von\nMises 1981, pp. 68 ff.) and von Neumann was influenced substantially\nby von Mises on the foundations of probability (von Neumann 1955, p.\n198 fn.). Later, von Neumann changed the basis for his expressed\nreason for dissatisfaction with infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces\nfrom probabilistic to algebraic considerations (Birkhoff and von\nNeumann 1936, p. 118); namely, that it violates Hankel\u2019s\nprinciple of the preservation of formal law, which leads one to try to\npreserve modularity \u2013 a condition that holds in\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces but not in infinite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. The problem with unbounded operators arises from their\nonly being defined on a merely dense subset of the set elements of the\nspace. This means that algebraic operations of unbounded operators\n(sums and products) cannot be generally defined; for example, it is\npossible that two unbounded operators \\(A\\), \\(B\\)\nare such that the range of \\(B\\) and\nthe domain of \\(A\\) are disjoint, in which case the\nproduct \\(AB\\) is meaningless.\n\nThe problems mentioned above do not arise for type-I\\(_n\\) factors, if\n\\(n\\lt \\infty\\), nor do they arise for type-II\\(_1\\). That is to say,\nthese factor types have a finite trace operation and are not plagued\nwith the domain problems of unbounded operators. Particularly\nnoteworthy is that the lattice of projections of each of these factor\ntypes (type-I\\(_n\\) for \\(n\\lt \\infty\\) and type-II\\(_1)\\) is modular.\nBy contrast, the set of bounded operators on an infinite-dimensional\nseparable Hilbert space, a type-I\\(_{\\infty}\\) factor, is not modular;\nrather, it is only orthomodular. These considerations serve to explain\nwhy von Neumann regarded the type-II\\(_1\\) factor as the proper\ngeneralization of the type-I\\(_n\\) \\((n\\lt \\infty)\\) for quantum\nphysics rather than the type-I\\(_{\\infty}\\) factors. The shift in the\nliterature from modular to orthomodular lattices that was\ncharacterized above is in effect a shift back to von Neumann\u2019s\nearlier position (prior to his confession). But, as was already\nmentioned, it now seems that this was not the best move either.\n\nIt was von Neumann\u2019s hope that his program for generalizing\nquantum theory would emerge from a new mathematical structure known as\n\u201ccontinuous geometry\u201d. He wanted to use this structure to\nbring together the three key elements that were mentioned above: the\nalgebraic approach to quantum mechanics, quantum logics, and rings of\noperators. He sought to forge a strong conceptual link between these\nelements and thereby provide a proper foundation for generalizing\nquantum mechanics that does not make essential use of Hilbert space\n(unlike rings of operators). Unfortunately, it turns out that the\nclass of continuous geometries is too broad for the purposes of\naxiomatizing quantum mechanics. The class must be suitably restricted\nto those having a transition probability. It turns out that there is\nthen no substantial generalization beyond the separable Hilbert space\nframework. An unpublished manuscript that was finished by von Neumann\nin 1937 was prepared and edited by Israel Halperin, and then published\nas von Neumann (1981). A review of the manuscript by Halperin was\npublished in von Neumann (1961\u20131963, Vol. IV, No. 16) years\nbefore the manuscript itself was published. In that review, Halperin\nnotes the following:\n\nThe final result, after 200 pages of deep reasoning is (essentially):\nevery such geometry with transition probability can be identified with\nthe projection geometry of a finite factor in some finite or infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space (I\\(_m\\) or II\\(_1)\\). This result indicates\nthat continuous geometries do not provide new useful mathematical\ndescriptions of quantum mechanical phenomena beyond that already\navailable from rings of operators.\n\n\nThis unfortunate development does not, however, completely undermine\nvon Neumann\u2019s efforts to generalize quantum mechanics. On the\ncontrary, his work on rings of operators does provide significant\nlight to the way forward. The upshot of subsequent developments is\nthat von Neumann settled on the wrong factor type for the foundations\nof physics.\n3. Dirac and the Foundations of Quantum Theory\n\nDirac\u2019s formal framework for quantum mechanics was very useful\nand influential despite its lack of mathematical rigor. It was used\nextensively by physicists and it inspired some powerful mathematical\ndevelopments in functional analysis. Eventually, mathematicians\ndeveloped a suitable framework for placing Dirac\u2019s formal\nframework on a firm mathematical foundation, which is known as a\nrigged Hilbert space (and is also referred to as a\nGelfand Triplet). This came about as follows. A rigorous\ndefinition of the \\(\\delta\\) function became possible in distribution\ntheory, which was developed by Schwartz from the mid-1940s to the\nearly 1950s. Distribution theory inspired Gelfand and collaborators\nduring the mid-to-late 1950s to formulate the notion of a rigged\nHilbert space, the firm foundation for Dirac\u2019s formal framework.\nThis development was facilitated by Grothendiek\u2019s notion of a\nnuclear space, which he introduced in the mid-1950s. The rigged\nHilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics was then developed\nindependently by B\u00f6hm and by Roberts in 1966. Since then, it has\nbeen extended to a variety of different contexts in the quantum domain\nincluding decay phenomena and the arrow of time. The mathematical\ndevelopments of Schwartz, Gelfand, and others had a substantial effect\non QFT as well. Distribution theory was taken forward by Wightman in\ndeveloping the axiomatic approach to QFT from the mid-1950s to the\nmid-1960s. In the late 1960s,\u00a0 the axiomatic approach was\nexplicitly put into the rigged Hilbert space framework by Bogoliubov\nand co-workers.\n\nAlthough these developments were only indirectly influenced by Dirac,\nby way of the mathematical developments that are associated with his\nformal approach to quantum mechanics, there are other elements of his\nwork that had a more direct and very substantial impact on the\ndevelopment of QFT. In the 1930s, Dirac (1933) developed a Lagrangian\nformulation of quantum mechanics and applied it to quantum fields ,\nand the latter inspired Feynman (1948) to develop the path-integral\napproach to QFT. The mathematical foundation for path-integral\nfunctionals is still lacking (Rivers 1987, pp, 109\u2013134), though\nsubstantial progress has been made (DeWitt-Morette et al.\n1979). Despite such shortcomings, it remains the most useful and\ninfluential approach to QFT to date. In the 1940s, Dirac (1943)\ndeveloped a form of quantum electrodynamics that involved an\nindefinite metric \u2013 see also Pauli (1943) in that connection.\nThis had a substantial influence on later developments, first in\nquantum electrodynamics in the early 1950s with the Gupta-Bluer\nformalism, and in a variety of QFT models such as vector meson fields\nand quantum gravity fields by the late 1950s \u2013 see Chapter 2 of\nNagy (1966) for examples and references.\n3.1 Dirac\u2019s \\(\\delta\\) Function, Principles, and Bra-Ket Notation\n\nDirac\u2019s attempt to prove the equivalence of matrix mechanics and\nwave mechanics made essential use of the \\(\\delta\\) function, as\nindicated above. The \\(\\delta\\) function was used by physicists before\nDirac, but it became a standard tool in many areas of physics only\nafter Dirac very effectively put it to use in quantum mechanics. It\nthen became widely known by way of his textbook (Dirac 1930), which\nwas based on a series of lectures on quantum mechanics given by Dirac\nat Cambridge University. This textbook saw three later editions: the\nsecond in 1935, the third in 1947, and the fourth in 1958. The fourth\nedition has been reprinted many times. Its staying power is due, in\npart, to another innovation that was introduced by Dirac in the third\nedition, his bra-ket formalism. He first published this formalism in\n(Dirac 1939), but the formalism did not become widely used until after\nthe publication of the third edition of his book. There is no question\nthat these tools, first the \\(\\delta\\) function and then the bra-ket\nnotation, were extremely effective for physicists practicing and\nteaching quantum mechanics both with regards to setting up equations\nand to the performance of calculations. Most quantum mechanics\ntextbooks use \\(\\delta\\) functions and plane waves, which are key\nelements of Dirac\u2019s formal framework, but they are not included\nin von Neumann\u2019s rigorous mathematical framework for quantum\nmechanics. Working physicists as well as teachers and students of\nquantum mechanics often use Dirac\u2019s framework because of its\nsimplicity, elegance, power, and relative ease of use. Thus, from the\nstandpoint of pragmatics, Dirac\u2019s framework is much preferred\nover von Neumann\u2019s. The notion of a rigged Hilbert space placed\nDirac\u2019s framework on a firm mathematical foundation.\n3.2 The Rigged Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\n\nMathematicians worked very hard to provide a rigorous foundation for\nDirac\u2019s formal framework. One key element was Schwartz\u2019s\n(1945; 1950\u20131951) theory of distributions. Another key element,\nthe notion of a nuclear space, was developed by Grothendieck (1955).\nThis notion made possible the generalized-eigenvector decomposition\ntheorem for self-adjoint operators in rigged Hilbert space \u2013 for\nthe theorem see Gelfand and Vilenken (1964, pp. 119\u2013127), and\nfor a brief historical account of the convoluted path leading to it\nsee Berezanskii (1968, pp. 756\u2013760). The decomposition principle\nprovides a rigorous way to handle observables such as position and\nmomentum in the manner in which they are presented in Dirac\u2019s\nformal framework. These mathematical developments culminated in the\nearly 1960s with Gelfand and Vilenkin\u2019s characterization of a\nstructure that they referred to as a rigged Hilbert space\n(Gelfand and Vilenkin 1964, pp. 103\u2013127). It is unfortunate that\ntheir chosen name for this mathematical structure is doubly\nmisleading. First, there is a natural inclination to regard it as\ndenoting a type of Hilbert space, one that is rigged in some\nsense, but this inclination must be resisted. Second, the term\nrigged has an unfortunate connotation of illegitimacy, as in\nthe terms rigged election or rigged roulette table,\nand this connotation must be dismissed as prejudicial. There is\nnothing illegitimate about a rigged Hilbert space from the standpoint\nof mathematical rigor (or any other relevant standpoint). A more\nappropriate analogy may be drawn using the notion of a rigged ship:\nthe term rigged in this context means fully equipped. But\nthis analogy has its limitations since a rigged ship is a fully\nequipped ship, but (as the first point indicates) a rigged Hilbert\nspace is not a Hilbert space, though it is generated from a Hilbert\nspace in the manner now to be described.\n\nA rigged Hilbert space is a dual pair of spaces \\((\\Phi , \\Phi^x)\\)\nthat can generated from a separable Hilbert space \\(\\Eta\\) using a\nsequence of norms (or semi-norms); the sequence of norms is generated\nusing a nuclear operator (a good approximate meaning is an operator of\ntrace-class, meaning that the trace of the modulus of the operator is\nfinite). In the mathematical theory of topological vector spaces, the\nspace \\(\\Phi\\) is characterized in technical terms as a nuclear\nFr\u00e9chet space. To say that \\(\\Phi\\) is a\nFr\u00e9chet space means that it is a complete metric\nspace, and to say that it is nuclear means that it is the\nprojective limit of a sequence of Hilbert spaces in which the\nassociated topologies get rapidly finer with increasing n (i.e., the\nconvergence conditions are increasingly strict); the term\nnuclear is used because the Hilbert-space topologies are\ngenerated using a nuclear operator. In distribution theory, the space\n\\(\\Phi\\) is characterized as a test-function space, where a\ntest-function is thought of as a very well-behaved function (being\ncontinuous, n-times differentiable, having a bounded domain or at\nleast dropping off exponentially beyond some finite range, etc).\n\\(\\Phi^x\\) is a space of distributions, and it is the topological dual\nof \\(\\Phi\\), meaning that it corresponds to the complete space of\ncontinuous linear functionals on \\(\\Phi\\). It is also the inductive\nlimit of a sequence of Hilbert spaces in which the topologies get\nrapidly coarser with increasing n. Because the elements of \\(\\Phi\\)\nare so well-behaved, \\(\\Phi^x\\) may contain elements that are not so\nwell-behaved, some being singular or improper functions (such as\nDirac\u2019s \\(\\delta\\) function). \\(\\Phi\\) is the topological\nanti-dual of \\(\\Phi^x\\), meaning that it is the complete set of\ncontinuous anti-linear functionals on \\(\\Phi^x\\); it is anti-linear\nrather than linear because multiplication by a scalar is defined in\nterms of the scalar\u2019s complex conjugate.\n\nIt is worth noting that neither \\(\\Phi\\) nor \\(\\Phi^x\\) is a Hilbert\nspace in that each lacks an inner product that induces a metric with\nrespect to which the space is complete, though for each space there is\na topology with respect to which the space is complete. Nevertheless,\neach of them is closely related to the Hilbert space \\(\\Eta\\) from\nwhich they are generated: \\(\\Phi\\) is densely embedded in \\(\\Eta\\),\nwhich in turn is densely embedded in \\(\\Phi^x\\). Two other points are\nworth noting. First, dual pairs of this sort can also be generated\nfrom a pre-Hilbert space, which is a space that has all the features\nof a Hilbert space except that it is not complete, and doing so has\nthe distinct advantage of avoiding the partitioning of functions into\nequivalence classes (in the case of functions spaces). The term\nrigged Hilbert space is typically used broadly to include\ndual pairs generated from either a Hilbert space or a pre-Hilbert\nspace. Second, the term Gelfand triplet is sometimes used\ninstead of the term rigged Hilbert space, though it refers to\nthe ordered set \\((\\Phi , \\Eta , \\Phi^x)\\), where \\(\\Eta\\) is the\nHilbert space used to generate \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Phi^x\\).\n\nThe dual pair \\((\\Phi , \\Phi^x)\\) possesses the means to represent\nimportant operators for quantum mechanics that are problematic in a\nseparable Hilbert space, particularly the unbounded operators that\ncorrespond to the observables position and momentum, and it does so in\na particularly effective and unproblematic manner. As already noted,\nthese operators have no eigenvalues or eigenvectors in a separable\nHilbert space; moreover, they are only defined on a dense subset of\nthe elements of the space and this leads to domain problems. These\nundesirable features also motivated von Neumann to seek an alternative\nto the separable Hilbert space framework for quantum mechanics, as\nnoted above. In a rigged Hilbert space, the\noperators\u00a0corresponding to position and momentum can have a\ncomplete set of eigenfunctionals (i.e., generalized eigenfunctions).\nThe key result is known as the nuclear spectral theorem (and it is\nalso known as the Gelfand-Maurin theorem). One version of the theorem\nsays that if A is a symmetric linear operator defined on the space\n\\(\\Phi\\) and it admits a self-adjoint extension to the Hilbert space\nH, then A possesses a complete system of eigenfunctionals belonging to\nthe dual space \\(\\Phi^x\\) (Gelfand and Shilov 1977, chapter 4). That\nis to say, provided that the stated condition is satisfied, A can be\nextended by duality to \\(\\Phi^x\\), its extension \\(A^x\\) is continuous\non \\(\\Phi^x\\) (in the operator topology in \\(\\Phi^x)\\), and \\(A^x\\)\nsatisfies a completeness relation (meaning that it can be decomposed\nin terms of its eigenfunctionals and their associated eigenvalues).\nThe duality formula for extending \\(A\\) to \\(\\Phi^x\\)\nis \\(\\braket{\\phi}{A^x\\kappa} = \\braket{A\\phi}{\\kappa}\\), for all\n\\(\\phi \\in \\Phi\\) and for all \\(\\kappa \\in \\Phi^x\\). The completeness\nrelation says that for all \\(\\phi ,\\theta \\in \\Phi\\): \n\n\\[ \\braket{A\\phi}{\\theta} = \\int_{v(A)} \\lambda \\braket{\\phi}{\\lambda} \\braket{\\lambda}{\\theta}^* \\mathrm{d}\\mu(\\lambda), \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(v(A)\\) is the set of all generalized eigenvalues of \\(A^x\\)\n(i.e., the set of all scalars \\(\\lambda\\) for which there is \\(\\lambda\n\\in \\Phi^x\\) such that \\(\\braket{\\phi}{A^x\\lambda} = \\lambda\n\\braket{\\phi}{\\lambda}\\) for all \\(\\phi \\in \\Phi)\\).\n\nThe rigged Hilbert space representation of these observables is about\nas close as one can get to Dirac\u2019s elegant and extremely useful\nformal representation with the added feature of being placed within a\nmathematically rigorous framework. It should be noted, however, that\nthere is a sense in which it is a proper generalization of\nDirac\u2019s framework. The rigging (based on the choice of a nuclear\noperator that determines the test function space) can result in\ndifferent sets of generalized eigenvalues being associated with an\noperator. For example, the set of (generalized) eigenvalues for the\nmomentum operator (in one dimension) corresponds to the real line, if\nthe space of test functions is the set \\(S\\) of\ninfinitely differentiable functions of \\(x\\) which\ntogether with all derivatives vanish faster than any inverse power of\n\\(x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity, whereas\nits associated set of eigenvalues is the complex plane, if the space\nof test functions is the set \\(D\\) of infinitely\ndifferentiable functions with compact support (i.e., vanishing outside\nof a bounded region of the real line). If complex eigenvalues are not\ndesired, then \\(S\\) would be a more appropriate choice\nthan \\(D\\) \u2013 see Nagel (1989) for a brief\ndiscussion. But there are situations in which it is desirable for an\noperator to have complex eigenvalues. This is so, for example, when a\nsystem exhibits resonance scattering (a type of decay phenomenon), in\nwhich case one would like the Hamiltonian to have complex eigenvalues\n\u2013 see B\u00f6hm & Gadella (1989). (Of course, it is\nimpossible for a self-adjoint operator to have complex eigenvalues in\na Hilbert space.)\n\nSoon after the development of the theory of rigged Hilbert spaces by\nGelfand and his associates, the theory was used to develop a new\nformulation of quantum mechanics. This was done independently by\nB\u00f6hm (1966) and Roberts (1966). It was later demonstrated that\nthe rigged Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics can handle a\nbroader range of phenomena than the separable Hilbert space\nformulation. That broader range includes scattering resonances and\ndecay phenomena (B\u00f6hm and Gadella 1989), as already noted.\nB\u00f6hm (1997) later extended this range to include a quantum\nmechanical characterization of the arrow of time. The Prigogine school\ndeveloped an alternative characterization of the arrow of time using\nthe rigged Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics (Antoniou\nand Prigogine 1993). Kronz (1998, 2000) used this formulation to\ncharacterize quantum chaos in open quantum systems. Castagnino and\nGadella (2003) used it to characterize\n decoherence\n in closed quantum systems.\n4 Mathematical Rigor: Two Paths\n4.1 Algebraic Quantum Field Theory\n\nIn 1943, Gelfand and Neumark published an important paper on an\nimportant class of normed rings, which are now known as abstract\n\\(C^*\\)-algebras. Their paper was influenced by Murray and von\nNeumann\u2019s work on rings of operators, which was discussed in the\nprevious section. In their paper, Gelfand and Neumark focus attention\non abstract normed \\(*\\)-rings. They show that any\n\\(C^*\\)-algebra can be given a concrete representation in a Hilbert\nspace (which need not be separable). That is to say, there is an\nisomorphic mapping of the elements of a \\(C^*\\)-algebra into the set\nof bounded operators of the Hilbert space. Four years later, Segal\n(1947a) published a paper that served to complete the work of Gelfand\nand Neumark by specifying the definitive procedure for constructing\nconcrete (Hilbert space) representations of an abstract\n\\(C^*\\)-algebra. It is called the GNS construction (after Gelfand,\nNeumark, and Segal). That same year, Segal (1947b) published an\nalgebraic formulation of quantum mechanics, which was substantially\ninfluenced by (though deviating somewhat from) von Neumann\u2019s\n(1963, Vol. III, No. 9) algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics,\nwhich is cited in the previous section. It is worth noting that\nalthough \\(C^*\\)-algebras satisfy Segal\u2019s postulates, the\nalgebra that is specified by his postulates is a more general\nstructure known as a Segal algebra. Every \\(C^*\\)-algebra is a Segal\nalgebra, but the converse is false since Segal\u2019s postulates do\nnot require an adjoint operation to be defined. If a Segal algebra is\nisomorphic to the set of all self-adjoint elements of a\n\\(C^*\\)-algebra, then it is a special or exceptional Segal algebra.\nAlthough the mathematical theory of Segal algebras has been fairly\nwell developed, a \\(C^*\\)-algebra is the most important type of\nalgebra that satisfies Segal\u2019s postulates.\n\nThe algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics that were developed by\nvon Neumann and Segal did not change the way that quantum mechanics\nwas done. Nevertheless, they did have a substantial impact in two\nrelated contexts: QFT and quantum statistical mechanics. The key\ndifference leading to the impact has to do with the domain of\napplicability. The domain of quantum mechanics consists of finite\nquantum systems, meaning quantum systems that have a finite number of\ndegrees of freedom. Whereas in QFT and quantum statistical mechanics,\nthe systems of special interest \u2013 i.e., quantum fields and\nparticle systems in the thermodynamic limit, respectively \u2013 are\ninfinite quantum systems, meaning quantum systems that have an\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom. Dirac (1927) was the first to\nrecognize the importance of infinite quantum systems for QFT, which is\nreprinted in Schwinger (1958).\n\nSegal (1959, p. 5) was the first to suggest that the beauty and power\nof the algebraic approach becomes evident when working with an\ninfinite quantum system . The key advantage of the algebraic approach,\naccording to Segal (1959, pp. 5\u20136), is that one may work in the\nabstract algebraic setting where it is possible to obtain interacting\nfields from free fields by an automorphism on the algebra, one that\nneed not be unitarily implementable. Segal notes (1959, p. 6) that von\nNeumann (1937) had a similar idea (that field dynamics are to be\nexpressed as an automorphism on the algebra) in an unpublished\nmanuscript. Segal notes this advantage in response to a result\nobtained by Haag (1955), that field theory representations of free\nfields are unitarily inequivalent to representations of interacting\nfields. Haag mentions that von Neumann (1938) first discovered\n\u2018different\u2019 (unitarily inequivalent) representations much\nearlier. A different way of approaching unitarily equivalent\nrepresentations, by contrast with Segal\u2019s approach, was later\npresented by Haag and Kastler (1964), who argued that unitarilty\ninequivalent representations are physically equivalent. Their notion\nof physical equivalence was based on Fell\u2019s mathematical idea of\nweak equivalence (Fell 1960).\n\nAfter indicating important similarities between his and von\nNeumann\u2019s approaches to infinite quantum systems, Segal draws an\nimportant contrast that serves to give the advantage to his approach\nover von Neumann\u2019s. The key mathematical difference, according\nto Segal, is that von Neumann was working with a weakly closed ring of\noperators (meaning that the ring of operators is closed with respect\nto the weak operator topology), whereas Segal is working with a\nuniformly closed ring of operators (closed with respect to the uniform\ntopology). It is crucial because it has the following interpretive\nsignificance, which rests on operational considerations:\n\nThe present intuitive idea is roughly that the only measurable\nfield-theoretic variables are those that can be expressed in terms of\na finite number of canonical operators, or uniformly\napproximated by such; the technical basis is a uniformly\nclosed ring (more exactly, an abstract \\(C^*\\)-algebra). The crucial\ndifference between the two varieties of approximation arises from the\nfact that, in general, weak approximation has only analytical\nsignificance, while uniform approximation may be defined\noperationally, two observables being close if the maximum (spectral)\nvalue of the difference is small (Segal 1959, p. 7).\n\n\nInitially, it appeared that Segal\u2019s assessment of the relative\nmerits of von Neumann algebras and \\(C^*\\)-algebras with respect to\nphysics was substantiated by a seminal paper, (Haag and Kastler 1964).\nAmong other things, Haag and Kastler introduced the key axioms of the\nalgebraic approach to QFT. They also argued that unitarily\ninequivalent representations are \u201cphysically equivalent\u201d\nto each other. However, the use of physical equivalence to show that\nunitarily inequivalent representations are not physically significant\nhas been challenged; see Kronz and Lupher (2005), Lupher (2018), and\nRuetsche (2011). The prominent role of type-III factor von Neumann\nalgebras within the algebraic approach to quantum statistical\nmechanics and QFT raises further doubts about Segal\u2019s\nassessment.\n\nThe algebraic approach has proven most effective in quantum\nstatistical mechanics. It is extremely useful for characterizing many\nimportant macroscopic quantum effects including crystallization,\nferromagnetism, superfluidity, structural phase transition,\nBose-Einstein condensation, and superconductivity. A good introductory\npresentation is Sewell (1986), and for a more advanced discussion see\nBratteli and Robinson (1979, 1981). In algebraic quantum statistical\nmechanics, an infinite quantum system is defined by specifying an\nabstract algebra of observables. A particular state may then be used\nto specify a concrete representation of the algebra as a set of\nbounded operators in a Hilbert space. Among the most important types\nof states that are considered in algebraic statistical mechanics are\nthe equilibrium states, which are often referred to as \u201cKMS\nstates\u201d (since they were first introduced by the physicists\nKubo, Martin, and Schwinger). There is a continuum of KMS states since\nthere is at least one KMS state for each possible temperature value\n\\(\\tau\\) of the system, for \\(0\\le \\tau \\le +\\infty\\). Given an\nautomorphism group, each KMS state corresponds to a representation of\nthe algebra of observables that defines the system, and each of these\nrepresentations is unitarily inequivalent to any other. It turns out\nthat each representation that corresponds to a KMS state is a factor:\nif \\(\\tau = 0\\) then it is a type-I factor, if \\(\\tau = +\\infty\\) then\nit is a type-II factor, and if \\(0\\lt \\tau \\lt +\\infty\\) then it is a\ntype-III factor. Thus, type-III factors play a predominant role in\nalgebraic quantum statistical mechanics.\n\nIn algebraic QFT, an algebra of observables is associated with bounded\nregions of Minkowski spacetime (and unbounded regions including all of\nspacetime by way of certain limiting operations) that are required to\nsatisfy standard axioms of local structure: isotony, locality,\ncovariance, additivity, positive spectrum, and a unique invariant\nvacuum state. The resulting set of algebras on Minkowski spacetime\nthat satisfy these axioms is referred to as the net of local\nalgebras. It has been shown that special subsets of the net of\nlocal algebras \u2013 those corresponding to various types of\nunbounded spacetime regions such as tubes, monotones (a tube that\nextends infinitely in one direction only), and wedges \u2013 are\ntype-III factors. Of particular interest for the foundations of\nphysics are the algebras that are associated with bounded spacetime\nregions, such as a double cone (the finite region of intersection of a\nforward and a backward light cone). As a result of work done over the\nlast thirty years, local algebras of relativistic QFT appear to be\ntype III von Neuman algebras see Halvorson (2007, pp. 749\u2013752)\nfor more details.\n\nOne important area for interpretive investigation is the existence of\na continuum of unitarily inequivalent representations of an algebra of\nobservables. Attitudes towards unitarily inequivalent representations\ndiffer drastically in the philosophical literature. In (Wallace 2006)\nunitarily inequivalent representations are not considered a\nfoundational problem for QFT, while in Ruetsche (2011), Lupher (2018)\nand Kronz and Lupher (2005) unitarily inequivalent representations are\nconsidered physically significant.\n4.2 Wightman\u2019s Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory\n\nIn the early 1950s, theoretical physicists were inspired to axiomatize\nQFT. One motivation for axiomatizing a theory, not the one for the\ncase now under discussion, is to express the theory in a completely\nrigorous form in order to standardize the expression of the theory as\na mature conceptual edifice. Another motivation, more akin to the case\nin point, is to embrace a strategic withdrawal to the foundations to\ndetermine how renovation should proceed on a structure that is\nthreatening to collapse due to internal inconsistencies. One then\nlooks for existing piles (fundamental postulates) that penetrate\nthrough the quagmire to solid rock, and attempts to drive home others\nat advantageous locations. Properly supported elements of the\nsuperstructure (such as the characterization of free fields,\ndispersion relations, etc.) may then be distinguished from those that\nare untrustworthy. The latter need not be razed immediately, and may\nultimately glean supportive rigging from components not yet\nconstructed. In short, the theoretician hopes that the axiomatization\nwill effectively separate sense from nonsense, and that this will\nserve to make possible substantial progress towards the development of\na mature theory. Grounding in a rigorous mathematical framework can be\nan important part of the exercise, and that was a key aspect of the\naxiomatization of QFT by Wightman.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Schwartz\u2019s theory of distributions was used by\nWightman (1956) to develop an abstract formulation of QFT, which later\ncame to be known known as axiomatic quantum field theory.\nMature statements of this formulation are presented in Wightman and\nG\u00e5rding (1964) and in Streater and Wightman (1964). It was\nfurther refined in the late 1960s by Bogoliubov, who explicitly placed\naxiomatic QFT in the rigged Hilbert space framework (Bogoliubov et\nal. 1975, p. 256). It is by now standard within the axiomatic\napproach to put forth the following six postulates: spectral condition\n(there are no negative energies or imaginary masses), vacuum state (it\nexists and is unique), domain axiom for fields (quantum fields\ncorrespond to operator-valued distributions), transformation law\n(unitary representation in the field-operator (and state) space of the\nrestricted inhomogeneous Lorentz group \u2013\n\u201crestricted\u201d means inversions are excluded, and\n\u201cinhomogeneous\u201d means that translations are included),\nlocal commutativity (field measurements at spacelike separated regions\ndo not disturb one another), asymptotic completeness (the scattering\nmatrix is unitary \u2013 this assumption is sometimes weakened to\ncyclicity of the vacuum state with respect to the polynomial algebra\nof free fields). Rigged Hilbert space entered the axiomatic framework\nby way of the domain axiom, so this axiom will be discussed in more\ndetail below.\n\nIn classical physics, a field is is characterized as a scalar- (or\nvector- or tensor-) valued function \\(\\phi(x)\\) on a domain that\ncorresponds to some subset of spacetime points. In QFT, a field is\ncharacterized by means of an operator rather than a function. A\nfield operator may be obtained from a classical field\nfunction by quantizing the function in the canonical manner \u2013\nsee Mandl (1959, pp. 1\u201317). For convenience, the field operator\nassociated with \\(\\phi(x)\\) is denoted below by the same expression\n(since the discussion below only concerns field operators). Field\noperators that are relevant for QFT are too singular to be regarded as\nrealistic, so they are smoothed out over their respective domains\nusing elements of a space of well-behaved functions known as test\nfunctions. There are many different test-functions spaces\n(Gelfand and Shilov 1977, Chapter 4). At first, the test-function\nspace of choice for axiomatic QFT was the Schwartz space\n\\(\\Sigma\\), the space of functions whose elements have partial\nderivatives of all orders at each point and such that each function\nand its derivatives decreases faster than \\(x^{-n}\\) for any \\(n\\in\nN\\) as \\(x\\rightarrow \\infty\\). It was later determined that some\nrealistic models require the use of other test-function spaces. The\nsmoothed field operators \\(\\phi[f\\)] for \\(f \\in \\Sigma\\) are known as\nquantum field operators, and they are defined as follows\n\n\\[ \\phi[f] = \\int d^4 x f(x)\\phi(x). \\]\n\n\nThe integral (over the domain of the field operator) of the product of\nthe test function \\(f(x)\\) and the field operator \\(\\phi(x)\\) serves\nto \u201csmooth out\u201d the field operator over its domain; a more\ncolloquial description is that the field is \u201csmeared out\u201d\nover space or spacetime. It is postulated within the axiomatic\napproach that a quantum field operator \\(\\phi[f\\)] may be represented\nas an unbounded operator on a separable Hilbert space \\(\\Eta\\), and\nthat \\(\\{\\phi[f]: f\\in \\Sigma \\}\\) (the set of smoothed field\noperators associated with \\(\\phi(x))\\) has a dense domain \\(\\Omega\\)\nin \\(\\Eta\\). The smoothed field operators are often referred to as\noperator-valued distributions, and this means that for every\n\\(\\Phi,\\Psi \\in \\Omega\\) there is an element of the space of\ndistributions \\(\\Sigma^x\\), the topological dual of \\(\\Sigma\\), that\nmay be equated to the expression \\(\\langle \\Phi {\\mid} \\phi[\\\n]{\\mid}\\Psi\\rangle\\). If \\(\\Omega'\\) denotes the set of functions\nobtained by applying all polynomials of elements of \\(\\{\\phi[f]: f\\in\n\\Sigma \\}\\) onto the unique vacuum state, then the axioms mentioned\nabove entail that \\(\\Omega'\\) is dense in \\(\\Eta\\) (asymptotic\ncompleteness) and that \\(\\Omega'\\subset \\Omega\\) (domain axiom). The\nelements of \\(\\Omega\\) correspond to possible states of the elements\nof \\(\\{\\phi[f]: f\\in \\Sigma \\}\\). Though only one field has been\nconsidered thus far, the formalism is easily generalizable to a\ncountable number of fields with an associated set of countably indexed\nfield operators \\(\\phi_k (x)\\) \u2013 cf. (Streater and Wightman\n1964).\n\nAs noted earlier, the appropriateness of the rigged Hilbert space\nframework enters by way of the domain axiom. Concerning that axiom,\nWightman says the following (in the notation introduced above, which\ndiffers slightly from that used by Wightman).\n\nAt a more advanced stage in the theory it is likely that one would\nwant to introduce a topology into \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\(\\phi[f\\)]\nbecomes a continuous mapping of \\(\\Omega\\) into \\(\\Omega\\). It is\nlikely that this topology has to be rather strong. We want to\nemphasize that so far we have only required that \\(\\langle\n\\Phi{\\mid}\\phi[f]{\\mid}\\Psi\\rangle\\) be continuous in \\(f\\)\nfor \\(\\Phi ,\\Psi\\) fixed; continuity in the\npair \\(\\Phi ,\\Psi\\) cannot be expected before we put a suitable strong\ntopology on \\(\\Omega\\) (Wightman and G\u00e5rding 1964, p. 137).\n\n\nIn Bogoliubov et al. (1975, p. 256), a topology is introduced\nto serve this role, though it is introduced on \\(\\Omega'\\) rather than\non \\(\\Omega\\). Shortly thereafter, they assert that it is not hard to\nshow that \\(\\Omega'\\) is a complete nuclear space with respect to this\ntopology. This serves to justify a claim they make earlier in their\ntreatise:\n\n\u2026 it is precisely the consideration of the triplet of spaces\n\\(\\Omega \\subset \\Eta \\subset \\Omega^*\\) which give a natural basis\nfor both the construction of a general theory of linear operators and\nthe correct statement of certain problems of quantum field theory\n(Bogoliubov et al. 1975, p. 34).\n\n\nNote that they refer to the triplet \\(\\Omega \\subset \\Eta \\subset\n\\Omega^*\\) as a rigged Hilbert space. In the terminology introduced\nabove, they refer in effect to the Gelfand triplet \\((\\Omega , \\Eta ,\n\\Omega^x )\\) or (equivalently) the associated rigged Hilbert space\n\\((\\Omega , \\Omega^x)\\) .\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the status of the field in\nalgebraic QFT differs from that in Wightman\u2019s axiomatic QFT. In\nboth approaches, a field is an abstract system having an infinite\nnumber of degrees of freedom. Sub-atomic quantum particles are field\neffects that appear in special circumstances. In algebraic QFT, there\nis a further abstraction: the most fundamental entities are the\nelements of the algebra of local (and quasi-local) observables, and\nthe field is a derived notion. The term local means bounded\nwithin a finite spacetime region, and an observable is not regarded as\na property belonging to an entity other than the spacetime region\nitself. The term quasi-local is used to indicate that we take\nthe union of all bounded spacetime regions. In short, the algebraic\napproach focuses on local (or quasi-local) observables and treats the\nnotion of a field as a derivative notion; whereas the axiomatic\napproach (as characterized just above) regards the field concept as\nthe fundamental notion. Indeed, it is common practice for proponents\nof the algebraic approach to distance themselves from the field notion\nby referring to their theory as \u201clocal quantum physics\u201d.\nThe two approaches are mutually complementary \u2013 they have\ndeveloped in parallel and have influenced each other by analogy\n(Wightman 1976). For a discussion of the close connections between\nthese two approaches, see Haag (1996, p. 106).\n5 Philosophical Issues\n5.1 Pragmatics versus Axiomatics \n\nMost physicists use Lagrangian QFT (LQFT) to make predictions that\nhave been experimentally verified with extraordinary precision in some\ncases. However, LQFT has been described as a \u201cgrab bag of\nconflicting mathematical ideas\u201d that has not provided a sharp\nmathematical description of what counts as a QFT model (Swanson 2017,\npp. 1\u20132). Those criticisms motivated mathematically inclined\nphysicists to search for a mathematically rigorous formulation of QFT.\nAxiomatic versions of QFT have been favored by mathematical physicists\nand most philosophers. With greater mathematical rigor it is possible\nto prove results about the theoretical structure of QFT independent of\nany particular Lagrangian. Axiomatic QFT provides clear conceptual\nframeworks within which precise questions and answers to\ninterpretational issues can be formulated. There are three main\naxiomatic frameworks for QFT: Wightman QFT, Osterwalder-Schrader QFT,\nand algebraic QFT. In Wightman QFT, the axioms use functional analysis\nand operator algebras and is closer to LQFT since its axioms describe\ncovariant field operators acting on a fixed Hilbert space. The\nOsterwalder-Schrader axioms use a functional integration approach to\nQFT. The algebraic QFT axioms use \\(C^*\\)-algebras to model local\nobservables. However, axiomatic QFT approaches are sorely lacking with\nregards to building empirically adequate models. Unlike quantum\nmechanics which has a canonical mathematical framework in terms of von\nNeumann\u2019s Hilbert space formulation, QFT has no canonical\nmathematical framework. Even though there is a canonical mathematical\nframework for quantum mechanics, there are many interpretations of\nthat framework, e.g., many-worlds, GRW, Copenhagen, Bohmian, etc...\nQFT has two levels that require interpretation: (1) which QFT\nframework should be the focus of these foundational efforts, if any,\nand (2) how that preferred framework should be interpreted. Since (1)\ninvolves issues about mathematical rigor and pragmatic virtues, it\ndirectly bears on the focus of this article. The lack of a canonical\nformulation of QFT threatens to impede any metaphysical or\nepistemological lessons that might be learned from QFT.\n\nOne view is that these two approaches to QFT, the mathematically\nrigorous axiomatic approach and the pragmatic / empirically adequate\nLQFT approach, are rival research programs (see David Wallace (2006,\n2011) and Doreen Fraser (2009, 2011)), though Swanson (2017) argues\nthat they are not rival programs. Fraser (2009, 2011) argues that the\ninterpretation of QFT should be based on the mathematically rigorous\napproach of axiomatic formulations of QFT. By contrast, Wallace (2006,\n2011) argues that an interpretation of QFT should be based on LQFT.\n(Wallace, in 2006, calls his preferred QFT framework conventional QFT\n(CQFT), but changes his terminology to LQFT in Wallace 2011). Swanson\n(2017) and Egg, Lam, and Oldofedi (2017) are good overviews of the\ndebate between Fraser and Wallace (for an extended analysis see James\nFraser 2016). The debate covers many different philosophical topics in\nQFT, which makes it more challenging to pin down exactly what is\nessential to the arguments for both sides (for one view of what is\nessential for the debate, see Egg, Lam, and Oldofedi 2017). One issue\nis the role of internal consistency established by mathematical rigor\nversus empirical adequacy. Wallace argues that LQFT is empirically\nadequate since it can describe the forces of the Standard Model. LQFT\nhas a collection of calculational techniques including perturbation\ntheory, path integrals, and renormalization group methods. One\ncriticism of LQFT is that the calculational techniques it uses are not\nmathematically rigorous. Wallace argues that renormalization group\nmethods puts perturbative QFT, an approach within LQFT, on\nmathematically rigorous ground and removes the main motivation for\naxiomatic QFT.\n5.1.1 Perturbative Quantum Field Theory \n\nWhat follows is a rough overview of perturbative QFT (see James Fraser\n2016 for more details). Since exactly solvable free QFT models are\nmore mathematically tractable than interacting QFT models,\nperturbative QFT treats interactions as perturbations to the free\nLagrangian assuming weak coupling. For strongly coupled theories like\nquantum chromodynamics that idealization fails. Using perturbation\ntheory, approximate solutions for interacting QFT models can be\ncalculated by expanding S-matrix elements in a power series in terms\nof a coupling parameter. However, the higher order terms will often\ncontain divergent integrals. Typically, renormalization of the higher\norder terms is required to get finite predictions. Two sources of\ndivergent integrals are infrared (long distance, low energy) and\nultraviolet (short distance, high energy) divergences. Infrared\ndivergences are often handled by imposing a long distance cutoff or\nputting a small non-zero lower limit for the integral over momentum. A\nsharp cutoff at low momentum is equivalent to putting the theory in a\nfinite volume box. Imposing asymptotic boundary conditions and\nrestricting the observables to long distance \u201cfriendly\u201d\nobservables also help with infrared divergences. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are often handled by imposing a momentum cutoff to remove\nhigh momentum modes of a theory. That is equivalent to freezing out\nvariations in the fields at arbitrarily short length scales. Putting\nthe system on a lattice with some finite spacing can also help deal\nwith the high momentum. Dimensional regularization, where the integral\nmeasure is redefined to range over a fractional number of dimensions,\ncan help with both infrared and ultraviolet divergences. The last step\nin renormalization is to remove the cutoffs by taking the continuum\nlimit (i.e., removing the high momentum cutoff) and the infinite\nvolume limit (i.e., removing the low momentum cutoff). The hope is\nthat the limit is well-defined and there are finite expressions of the\nseries at each order.\n\nJames Fraser (2016) identifies three problems for perturbative QFT.\n(1) The rigor problem: perturbative QFT is not mathematically\nrigorous which makes it difficult to analyze and interpret. (2)\nThe consistency problem: perturbative calculations rest on\nthe interaction picture existing, but Haag\u2019s theorem seems to\nshow that the interaction picture does not exist. (3) The\njustification problem: renormalization lacks physical motivation\nand appears ad hoc. James Fraser argues that (1) and (2) do not pose\nsevere problems for perturbative QFT because it is not attempting to\nbuild continuum QFT models. It is building approximate physical\nquantities \u2013 not mathematical structures that are to be\ninterpreted as physical systems.\n\nBaker (2016) and Swanson (2017) note that LQFT makes false or unproven\nassumptions such as the convergence of certain infinite sums in\nperturbation theory. Dyson (1952) gives a heuristic argument that\nquantum electrodynamic perturbation series do not converge. Baker and\nSwanson also argue that the use of long distance cutoffs is at odds\nwith cosmological theory and astronomical observations which suggest\nthat the universe is spatially infinite. Even in the weak coupling\nlimit where perturbation theory can be formally applied, it is not\nclear when the perturbative QFT gives an accurate approximation of the\nunderlying physics. In the interacting \\(\\phi^4\\) theory, when the\ndimension is less than 4 for Minkowski spacetime, the theory is\nnontrivial, but when the dimension is greater than 4, the renormalized\nperturbation series is asymptotic to a free field theory even though\nit appears to describe nontrivial interactions. When there are 4\ndimensions, the theory is also trivial if additional technical\nassumptions hold (see Swanson 2017 (p. 3) for more details).\n5.1.2 Path Integrals in Quantum Field Theory\n\nAnother area where questions of mathematical rigor arise within\nperturbative QFT is the use of path integrals. The S-matrix power\nseries expansion contains integrals over momentum space and this is\nwhere path integrals / Feynman diagrams have been helpful for making\ncalculations. The key concept is the partition function \\(Z\\),\nwhich is defined as a functional integral involving\nthe action, which is itself an integral of the Lagrangian. The\nfollowing details come mainly from Hancox-Li (2017). More\nspecifically, the action is a functional of quantum fields. The\nfunctional integral over the action ranges over all possible\ncombinations of the quantum fields values over spacetime. Informally,\nthe sum is being taken over all possible field configurations. As\nSwanson (2017) notes, the path integral requires choosing a measure\nover an infinite dimensional path space, which is only mathematically\nwell-defined in special cases. For example, if the system is\nformulated on a hypercubic lattice, then the measure can be defined\n(see section 1.2 of James Fraser 2016). Another way of having a\nwell-defined measure is to restrict attention to a finite dimensional\nsubspace. But if functions are allowed to vary arbitrarily on short\nlength scales, then the integral ceases to be well-defined (Wallace\n2006, p. 42). All of the correlation functions (i.e., vacuum state\nexpectation values of the fields at different spacetime points), can\nbe derived from the partition function \\(Z\\). So, given\n\\(Z\\), all empirical quantities associated with the\nLagrangian can be calculated, e.g., scattering cross-sections. Finding\n\\(Z\\) amounts to a solution of LQFT. \\(Z\\)\ncan be expanded in a Taylor series in the coupling\nconstant. When this is done, two types of divergences can occur: (1)\nindividual terms of the perturbation series can diverge and/or (2) the\nperturbation series itself is divergent, though the series may be an\nasymptotic series. To deal with (1), physicists do the following\nprocedures (Hancox-Li 2017, pp. 344\u2013345): (i) regularization, which\ninvolves reducing the number of degrees of freedom via dimensional\nregularization, momentum cutoffs, or using a lattice formulation and\n(ii) add counterterms to compensate for the regularization in (i). But\nthis construction is purely formal and not mathematically defined. The\nrules used to manipulate the Lagrangian, and hence the partition\nfunction, are not well-defined.\n5.1.3 Renormalization Group Techniques \n\nWallace (2011) argues that renormalization group techniques have\novercome the mathematical deficiencies of older renormalization\ncalculational techniques (for more details on the renormalization\ngroup see Butterfield and Bouatta 2015, Fraser 2016, Hancox-Li (2015a,\n2015b, 2017)). According to Wallace, the renormalization group methods\nput LQFT on the same level of mathematical rigor as other areas of\ntheoretical physics. It provides a solid theoretical framework that is\nexplanatorily rich in particle physics and condensed matter physics,\nso the impetus for axiomatic QFT has been resolved. Renormalization\ngroup techniques presuppose that QFT will fail at some short length\nscale, but the empirical content of LQFT is largely insensitive to the\ndetails at such short length scales. Doreen Fraser (2011) argues that\nrenormalization group methods help articulate the empirical content of\nQFT, but the renormalization group has no significance for the\ntheoretical content of QFT insofar as it does not tell us whether we\nshould focus on LQFT or AQFT. James Fraser (2016) and Hancox-Li\n(2015b) argue that the renormalization group does more than provide\nempirical predictions in QFT. The renormalization group gives us\nmethods for studying the behavior of physical systems at different\nenergy scales, namely how properties of QFT models depend or do not\ndepend on small scale structure. The renormalization group provides a\nnon-perturbative explanation of the success of perturbative QFT.\nHancox-Li (2015b) discusses how mathematicians working in constructive\nQFT use non-perturbative approximations with well controlled error\nbounds to prove the existence or non-existence of ultraviolet fixed\npoints. Hancox-Li argues that the renormalization group explains\nperturbative renormalization non-perturbatively. The renormalization\ngroup can tell us whether certain Lagrangians have an ultraviolet\nlimit that satisfies the axioms a QFT should satisfy. Thus, the use of\nthe renormalization group in constructive QFT can provide additional\ndynamical information (e.g., whether a certain dynamics can occur in\ncontinuous spacetime) that a pure axiomatic approach does not.\n5.2 Middle Grounds\n\nEgg, Lam, and Oldofredi (2017) argue that the main disagreement\nbetween Doreen Fraser and David Wallace is over the very definition of\nQFT. Fraser takes QFT to be the union of quantum theory and special\nrelativity. If QFT = QM + SR as Fraser maintains, then LQFT fails to\nsatisfy that criterion since it employs cutoffs which violate\nPoincar\u00e9 covariance. For Wallace, the violation of QFT\nPoincar\u00e9 covariance is not as worrisome. QFT is not a truly\nfundamental theory since gravity is absent. Wallace is more interested\nin what QFT\u2019s approximate truth tells us about the world. LQFT\ngives us an effective ontology. The renormalization group tell us that\nQFT cannot be trusted in the high energy regimes where quantum gravity\ncan be expected to apply, i.e., the Planckian length scale where\ngravitational effects cannot be ignored. The violation of\nPoincar\u00e9 covariance via cutoffs may not amount to much if the\nfundamental quantum theory of gravity imposes some real cutoff,\naccording to Wallace. There are, however, other options to\nconsider.\n5.2.1 Pluralistic Approaches \n\nSome philosophers have rejected the seemingly either-or nature of the\ndebate between Wallace and Fraser to embrace more pluralistic views.\nOn these pluralistic views, different formulations of QFT might be\nappropriate for different philosophical questions. Baker (2016)\nadvocates that AQFT or LQFT should be trusted in domains of inquiry\nwhere their idealizations are unproblematic. For example, if the\ndomain to be interpreted is the Standard Model, then LQFT is the\nappropriate framework. Swanson (2017) analyzes LQFT, AQFT, and\nWightman QFT and argues that all three approaches are complementary\nand have no deep incompatibilities. LQFT supplies various powerful\npredictive tools and explanatory schemas. It can account for gauge\ntheories, the Standard Model of particle physics, the weak and strong\nnuclear force, and the electromagnetic force. However, the collection\nof calculational techniques are not all mathematically well-defined.\nLQFT provides QFT theories at only certain length scales and cannot\nmake use of unitarily inequivalent representations since LQFT uses\ncutoffs which renders all representations finite dimensional and\nunitarily equivalent by the Stone-von Neumann theorem. Axiomatic QFT\nis supposed to provide a rigorous description of fundamental QFT at\nall length scales, but that conflicts with the effective field theory\nviewpoint where QFT is only defined for certain lengths. But if\naxiomatic QFT capture what all QFTs have in common, then effective\nfield theories should be captured by it as well. Axiomatic QFT gives a\nprecise regimentation of LQFT, but it is unclear if axiomatic QFT is\nfully faithful to the LQFT picture. Within the axiomatic approach,\nWightman QFT has many sophisticated tools for building concrete models\nof QFT in addition to rigorously proving structural results like the\nPCT theorem and the spin statistics theorem. But Wightman QFT relies\non localized gauge-dependent field operators that do not directly\nrepresent physical properties. AQFT might provide a more physically\ntransparent gauge-free description of QFT. It has topological tools to\ndefine global quantities like temperature, energy, charge, particle\nnumber which use unitarily inequivalent representations. But AQFT has\ndifficulty constructing models. While LQFT is more mathematically\namorphous, there are recent algebraic constructions of low dimensional\ninteracting models with no known Lagrangian, which suggest that AQFT\nis more general than LQFT (Swanson 2017, p. 5). However, LQFT provides\nconstructive QFT with guidance on correctly building models\ncorresponding to Lagrangians particle physicists use with great\nempirical success (Hancox-Li 2017, p. 353).\n5.2.2 Constructive Quantum Field Theory\n\nConstructive QFT is an attempt to mediate between LQFT and axiomatic\nQFT by rigorously constructing specific interacting models of QFT. The\nnontrivial solutions it constructs are supposed to correspond to\nLagrangians that particle physicists use. This ensures that various\naxiomatic systems have a physical connection to the world via the\nempirical success of LQFT. While constructive QFT has done this for\nsome models with dimensions less than 4, it has not yet been\naccomplished for a 4 dimensional Lagrangian that particle physicists\nuse. Any model that satisfies the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms will\nautomatically satisfy the Wightman axioms. Constructive QFT tries to\nconstruct the functional integral measures for path integrals by\nshifting from Minkowski spacetime to Euclidean spacetime via a Wick\nrotation (what follows is based on section four of Hancox-Li (2017)).\nIn Euclidean field theory, the Schwinger functions, which are defined\nin terms of \\(Z\\), must satisfy the\nOsterwalder-Schrader axioms. The measure of \\(Z\\) is a\nGaussian measure on the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing\nfunctions. The Osterwalder-Schrader axioms are related to the Wightman\naxioms by the Osterwalder-Schrader Reconstruction Theorem which states\nthat any set of functions satisfying the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms\ndetermines a unique Wightman model whose Schwinger functions form that\nset. It allows the constructive field theorists to use the advantages\nof Euclidean space for defining a measure while ensuring that they are\nconstructing models that exist in Minkowski spacetime. It still has to\nbe verified that the solution corresponds to a renormalized\nperturbation series that physicists derive for the corresponding\nLagrangian in LQFT. The challenge is how to translate something not\nmathematically well-defined into something that is while showing that\nthe \u201csolutions\u201d in LQFT can be reproduced by something\nthat is consistent with a set of axioms. This is crucial since, as\nSwanson (2017) points out, it is unclear whether perturbation theory\nis an accurate guide for the underlying physics described by LQFT.\nThis leads Hancox-Li (2017) to argue that mathematically unrigorous\nLQFT is relevant to the rigorous program of constructive QFT in\nbuilding rigorous interacting models of QFT. Those models correspond\nto the Lagrangians of interest to particle physicists. Hence, LQFT can\ninform the theoretical content of QFT.\n\nAnother tool of constructive QFT is the use of asymptotic series,\nwhich can tell us which function the perturbative series is asymptotic\nto, which perturbative QFT does not. Constructive QFT tries to\ndetermine some properties of non-perturbative solutions to the\nequations of motion which guarantee that certain methods of summing\nasymptotic expansions will lead to a unique solution (see Hancox-Li\n2017, pp. 349\u2013350, for more details). Is the rigorously defined\npartition function \\(Z\\) asymptotic to the renormalized\nperturbative series? Roughly, a function is asymptotic to a series\nexpansion when successive terms of the series provide an increasingly\naccurate description of how quickly the function grows. The difference\nbetween the function and each order of the perturbation series is\napproximately small. But there are many different functions that have\nthe same asymptotic expansion. Ideally, we want there to be a unique\nfunction because then there is a unique non-perturbative solution. The\nconcept of strong asymptoticity requires that the difference between\nthe function and each order of the series is smaller than what was\nrequired by asymptoticity. A strongly asymptotic series uniquely\ndetermines a function. If there is a strong asymptotic series, then\nthe function can be uniquely reconstructed from the series by Borel\nsummation. The Borel transform of the series is given by dividing the\ncoefficients each term in the series by a factorial of the order of\nthat term and then integrating to recover the exact function. In\nconstructive QFT, the goal is to associate a unique function with a\nrenormalized perturbation series and some kind of Borel summability is\nthe main candidate so far, though the Borel transform cannot remove\nlarge-order divergences. The asymptotic behavior of the renormalized\nperturbation series can be extremely sensitive to the choice of\nregularization and render it asymptotic to a free field theory even if\nit appears to describe nontrivial perturbations (see Swanson 2017, p.\n11, for more details).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Antoniou, I. and Prigogine, I., 1993, \u201cIntrinsic\nIrreversibility and Integrability of Dynamics\u201d, <em>Physica\nA</em>, 192: 443\u2013464.", "Baker, D., 2016, \u201cPhilosophy of Quantum Field Theory\u201d,\n<em>Oxford Handbooks Online</em>, doi:\n10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935314.013.33", "Birkhoff, G., and von Neumann, J., 1936, \u201cThe Logic of\nQuantum Mechanics\u201d, <em>Annals of Mathematics</em>, 37:\n823\u2013843.", "Berezanskii, J.
