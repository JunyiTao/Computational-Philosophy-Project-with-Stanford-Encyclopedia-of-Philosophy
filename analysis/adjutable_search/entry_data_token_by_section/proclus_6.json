    "main_text": "Philosophical views || Causality\n3.2 Causality\n\n\na. Auxiliary and true causes. From Middle Platonism onwards,\nvarious attempts were made to integrate the Aristotelian doctrine of\ncauses within the Platonic philosophy (see Steel 2003). In Plato\u2019s\nwork, it was argued, one can find the four types of causality that\nAristotle distinguishes, to wit formal, material, efficient, final,\nand, besides, the paradigmatic cause, which Aristotle wrongly\nrejected. This system of causes (with the addition of the instrumental\ncause as a sixth) became standard in later Neoplatonism.  In his\ncommentary on the Timaeus, Proclus observes that Aristotle\nnever rises to the proper level of causality. For the four causes, as\nAristotle understands them, can only be applied to the explanation of\nprocesses in the sublunary world. In the Platonic view, however, the\nmaterial and formal causes are only subservient or instrumental\ncauses. Those causes are in fact immanent in their effects and\nconstitutive elements of the thing they produce. As Proclus asserts in\nprop. 75 of the\nElements of Theology, \u201cthat which exists in the effect\nis not so much a cause as an auxiliary cause (sunaition) or\nan instrument of the producer.\u201d Causes in the proper sense must\nact upon their effects from outside, while transcending them. For a\nproper understanding of what the true causes are of all things,\nProclus argues, one must follow Plato, who lifts us up to the level of\nthe transcendent Forms and makes us discover the creative causality of\nthe demiurge and the finality of the Good as the ultimate explanation\nof all aspirations.\n\n\nAlthough Aristotle also discusses efficient and final causes, he\nfalls short of a true understanding of creative causality because he\nabandons the hypothesis of the Forms. Without the transcendent Forms,\nthere can be no explanation of the being of things, only an explanation\nof their movement and change. Given Aristotle\u2019s narrow\nunderstanding of nature, it must come as no surprise, Proclus notices,\nthat he admits of cases of \u2018spontaneous generation\u2019 in the\nsublunary realm, which again restricts the purport of efficient\ncausality. Moreover, because of his rejection of the demiurge (and of the One),\nAristotle is also forced to limit efficient causality to the sublunary\nrealm. In fact, in his view there is no cause of existence of the\ncelestial bodies or of the sensible world as a whole: they exist\nnecessarily in all eternity. But, as Proclus argues, such a position\nwill force him to admit that the world has the capacity to constitute\nitself, which is absurd (see below).\n\n\nThe Neoplatonic concept of causality is therefore quite different from\nthat of the Peripatetics, even if both share the same terminology,\nsuch as final or efficient cause. Aristotle\u2019s causes are primarily\nintended to explain how things move and change, come to be and cease\nto be, but also offer to explain what given things are. For\nthe Neoplatonists, generalizing a principle formulated in\nthe Philebus \u2014 \u201cthat everything that comes to be\ncomes to be through a cause\u201d (26e, cf. Tim. 28a)\n\u2014 causality is of much wider application than the explanation of\nchange and motion, it is not only about what things are, but about\nwhat constitutes (hupostatikos) their being, and it can be,\nanalogously, used to explain relations between all levels of\nbeing. Thus we can say of the One that it is the cause of Intellect,\nand of Intellect that it is cause of Soul. In the Timaeus,\nhowever, the main interest is to understand what is the cause of the\nsensible world and all the cosmic beings: this is primarily the\ndemiurge or creator of the world (the One is not the\n\u2018creator\u2019 of Intellect).\n\n\nb. Corporeal and incorporeal causes. According to the\nStoics only bodies and powers or qualities of bodies are capable of\nacting and being acted upon (see Steel 2002). The Platonists often\ncriticized the Stoic view and pointed to what they thought were the\nmany contradictions involved, in particular, in the materialistic\nexplanation of psychic activities or dispositions such as virtues. They\ndefended the opposite view: all forms of causality must ultimately be\nexplained as emanating from incorporeal entities. Proclus adopts\nPlotinus\u2019 view (IV, 7 [2] 8a), that only incorporeal beings can\nbe causes in the strict sense, and includes it among the basic theorems\nof his metaphysics. See Elem. Theol. \u00a7 80 (cf.\nTheol. Plat. I 14, p. 61.23\u201362.1):\n\n\nEvery body has by its own nature the capacity to be acted\nupon, every incorporeal thing the capacity to act, the former being in\nitself inactive, the latter impassive; but through association with the\nbody, the incorporeal too is acted upon, just as bodies too can act\nbecause of the participation in incorporeal entities.\n\n\nIn this proposition Proclus first sets apart the corporeal and\nincorporeal as being active/impassible and passive/inactive\nrespectively. However, the two realms are not absolutely separate from\neach other. The soul, which is an incorporeal substance, enters into\nassociation with the body and thus becomes itself, though only\naccidentally, subject to different passions. The body, on the contrary,\nmay gain great profit from the association with the incorporeal. This\nis evident in the case of animated bodies, which owe all their vital\nactivities to the presence of the soul in them. But also inanimate\nnatural bodies acquire all capacities and powers from nature and its\ninherent logoi or organizing rational principles (see Steel\n2002).\n\n\nc. The relation of cause to its effect. The relation\nbetween a cause and its effect is characterized by both similarity and\ndissimilarity. For every cause produces something that is similar to\nit, and every effect thus resembles its cause, though in a secondary\nand less perfect way. But in so far as the effect is really\ndistinguished from its cause, it acquires its own characteristic form\nof being, which was not yet developed on the level of its cause. For\nthis reason each thing can be said to exist in three manners\n(Elem. Theol. \u00a7 65). First, it is in itself as\nexpressing formally its own character (kath\u2019 hyparxin).\nSecond, it exists in a causal manner (kat\u2019\naitian) being anticipated in its cause. Finally, it exists\nas being participated (kata methexin) by the\nnext level of being, which is its effect. Thus life is a property of a\nliving organism as being participated by it. Life characterizes the\nsoul formally. Life also exists qua Form in the divine\nmind. Finally, Proclus stresses that the higher a cause, the more\ncomprehensive it is, and the further its effects reach (Elem.\nTheol. \u00a7 57). All things, including matter, which\nhas in itself, apart from the forms existing in it, no\n\u2018being\u2019, participate in the One; all beings participate in\nBeing; all plants and animals participate in Life; all rational souls\nparticipate in Intellect.\n",
