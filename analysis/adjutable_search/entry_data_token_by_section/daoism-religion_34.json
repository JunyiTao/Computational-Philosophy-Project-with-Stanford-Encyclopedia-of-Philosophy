In\nthe Daoist perspective, ethics and morals therefore are not a branch\nof \u201cphilosophical thought\u201d, but also pertain to the basic\nfield of Nourishing Life. (On Daoist precepts see Schipper 2001, and\nthe translation of a representative text in Hendrischke and Penny\n1996.)\n\nThis and the next sections are concerned with the three main groups of\nteachings and practices mentioned above.\n",
