    "main_text": "Some Themes in Strawson\u2019s Writings || Language\n9.2 Language\n\nStrawson\u2019s contribution to the philosophy of language is also\nfar more extensive and important than so far indicated. He developed\nhis views in relation to the leading ideas of others about language.\nOne conception that he opposed is that of Quine. Writing with Grice,\nhe argued that Quine\u2019s criticisms of the idea of analyticity\nrest on a commitment to a kind of reduction that itself is simply a\ndogma. Moreover, repeatedly over the next twenty years he argued that\nQuine\u2019s sceptical approach to meaning and related notions is\nboth unfounded and also wrong in that it deprives us of notions that\nwe cannot do without in the study of logic and language. Strawson also\nengaged with Davidson\u2019s account of meaning, mainly in his\ninaugural lecture \u2018Meaning and Truth\u2019 (1969), but also\nelsewhere. Strawson suggests that truth is itself a notion secondary\nto saying (and communication) and cannot play the role in an account\nof meaning that Davidson proposed. His other reaction to the\nDavidsonian programme, which accepted a notion of logical form for\nnatural language sentences specified in the complex formulae of\npredicate logic, was to deny that there is a requirement to map\nordinary language onto artificial logical structures. This attitude\nplaced Strawson in opposition to a movement of thought that swept\nthrough Oxford\u2019s younger philosophers during his time as a\nprofessor. And what Strawson never quite achieved was an alternative\nexplanation to Davidson\u2019s of what a theory of meaning should be.\nHis attitude to truth, and his slogan that ordinary language has no\nprecise logic, implied that centring an analysis of meaning on truth\nconditions and a search for logical forms in natural language\nexpressible in the predicate calculus was misguided. But he did not\ngive a positive account of how we do understand linguistic\nutterances.\n\nStrawson also made important contributions to the assessment of\nAustin\u2019s theory of speech acts and Grice\u2019s own model of\nmeaning. Finally, he responded to the anti-realist approach developed\nby Dummett, which also gained its adherents, in \u2018Scruton and\nWright on Anti-Realism\u2019 (1976), a brief but brilliant critique\nwhich argued that there are no obvious reasons to adopt the\nanti-realist account of truth, and moreover that it is hard to make\nthat account consistent with what appear to be obvious facts about the\nknowability (or unknowability) of our psychological lives and the\npast.\n",
