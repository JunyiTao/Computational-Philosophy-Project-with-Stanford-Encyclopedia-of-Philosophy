    "main_text": "Constitutive Aim || Motivations and Different Versions of the View\n6.1 Motivations and Different Versions of the View\n\nWhat could motivate the idea that actions have a constitutive aim\nabove and beyond the particular ends they pursue? An important\nconsideration is that, arguably, only by appealing to a constitutive\naim, can we evaluate actions and have a proper standard of practical\nreason. Much in the same way that the aim of belief (generally thought\nto be \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d) might provide a\nstandard for theoretical reasoning and correct belief, a constitutive\naim of action would provide a standard for practical reasoning and\nsuccessful action. More specifically, it seems that some actions are\nsuccessful in achieving their particular ends and yet are cases of\npractical failures in some deeper way, exhibiting what appears like\npractical irrationality or at least some form of practical ignorance.\nSuppose I have dreamt all my life to move to Seattle, and I finally\nsecured a position in the city. However, as I arrive in Seattle and\ntry to arrange my life, my life in Seattle is a great disappointment;\neven though there is nothing important that I found out about Seattle\nthat I didn\u2019t know already, I completely regret having pursued\nthis end. Although I achieved my aim of moving to Seattle, my actions\nseem to have failed in an important way; arguably, I manifested my\nagency in a defective way.\n\nOf course, one can explain my disappointment in many ways that do not\nseem to presuppose a constitutive aim of action: there were other ends\nthat I had that conflict with moving to Seattle and I hadn\u2019t\nfully appreciated this beforehand. Perhaps I no longer care about the\nthings that made me want to move to Seattle; moving to Seattle was a\nmeans to ends I had abandoned and didn\u2019t realize that it made no\nlonger sense to pursue this end. But it is unclear that these\nobservations will suffice; it seems that none of this might have\nhappened and yet my move to Seattle was still a practical failure.\n\nLet us take a concrete example: suppose the constitutive aim of action\nis happiness (see Frey 2019 for an argument that this is a view held\nby Aquinas). On this view, then, every action (directly or indirectly)\naims at happiness, and the realization of an end that does not result\nin happiness is a shortcoming of my agency. Therefore, if my going to\nSeattle did not contribute to my happiness, or if, worse, it\ncontributed to undermining it, then it was a defective case of agency.\nThis failure is often thought to parallel the kind of internal failure\ninvolved in false beliefs: such beliefs supposedly fail to meet a\nstandard internal to theoretical cognition.\n\nAnother, related, way to motivate the idea that action has a\nconstitutive aim focuses on the standpoint of deliberation. When\ndeliberating about what to do, it seems that I need to find an answer\nto the question \u201cwhat to do\u201d or \u201cwhether to\n\u03c6\u201d (Hieronymi 2005; 2006; Shah 2008); in the good case, my\naction expresses an adequate answer to this question. But how could I\ngo about answering these questions if action did not have a\nconstitutive aim; if there\u2019s nothing that could count as the\ncorrect way of answering this question? Similarly, from the point of\nview of action explanation, some answers seem to provide an\nintelligible explanation of action while others seem to invite the\nquestion \u201cbut why would you aim at (want) that?\u201d\nIf you ask me \u201cWhy are we eating the jello?\u201d,\n\u201cBecause it is blue\u201d seems to invite further questions,\nwhile \u201cBecause I find the taste pleasant\u201d brings the\ninquiry to an end. Anscombe argues that the search for further\nexplanations ends when we hit a \u201cdesirability\ncharacterization\u201d, something that is not just conceived as good\nbut \u201creally \u2026 one of the many forms of the\ngood\u201d (Anscombe 1957, \u00a740).\n\nThere seems to be a parallel structure in the case of belief: in\ndeliberating about what to believe, it seems that I must be similarly\nguided by an ideal of correct belief (Shah and Velleman 2006). In\nfact, philosophers who accept that there is a constitutive aim of\naction often compare action and belief (Velleman 1992; 1996; Tenenbaum\n2007; 2012; 2018b; Schafer 2013). Belief is supposed to have truth as\nits constitutive aim, and just as belief is held, at least in the good\ncase, in accordance with this constitutive aim (as Hume 1748 said,\n\u201ca wise man \u2026 proportions his belief to the\nevidence\u201d), intentional agency is guided by its constitutive\naim.\n\nThere are various proposals of what the constitutive aim of an action\nmight be. Perhaps the most traditional version of this view is the\nidea that the good is the constitutive aim of agency, possibly going\nback to Socrates (Protagoras 351a\u20138e; Gorgias\n467c\u20138d). The notion of \u201cgood\u201d involved here can be\nvery thin, meaning no more than \u201cconsidering matters\naright\u201d (Williams 1981) in the realm of practical reason; such\nviews are versions of the thesis often called \u201cthe guise of the\ngood\u201d (Tenenbaum 2007; Clark 2010; Schafer 2013). According to\nthe guise of the good, if I \u03c6 intentionally, then I must take\n\u03c6-ing to be good. Arguably some other versions of the constitutive\naim of agency are specifications of the thin notion of\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201chuman good\u201d (see Boyle and Lavin\n2010). Other constitutive aims that have been defended in literature\nare self-understanding or autonomy (Velleman 1989; 1992; 1996; 2009),\nself-constitution (Korsgaard 1996; 2008; 2009), and the will to power\n(Katsafanas 2013).\n",
