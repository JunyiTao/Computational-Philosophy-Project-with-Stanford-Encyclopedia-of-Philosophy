    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics || Moral deliberation\n2.4 Moral deliberation\n\nFor the Phenomenological axiologists, deliberation bridges the\naxiological and practical spheres. It begins in the evaluation of the\n(apparent) goods we might pursue in action and of the (possible)\nactions conducive to them. Most importantly, deliberation identifies\nthose ends that appear as ones to which an agent might commit herself\nin order to give meaning and significance to her life as a whole.\nDeliberation terminates in the choice to pursue particular ends and to\nundertake particular actions in that pursuit. Deliberation involves\nreflection and reason. The subject deliberatively determines which\nend(s) she will pursue given her abilities, interests, and concerns as\nwell as which actions best conduce to the chosen ends given the\nparticulars of the situation in which she is to act.\n\nRicoeur (1950 [2007: 137ff.]) speaks of decision as having a\n\u201chistory\u201d and points to what he calls\n\u201chesitation\u201d as central to this history. From one point of\nview, the capacity for choice manifests itself in hesitation, the\nwavering between different possibilities for projects or for actions.\nFrom another point of view, hesitation is an\n\u201cin-decision\u201d, as a \u201cfalling short of choice\u201d,\nas a being-on-the-way to a choice, which, as of yet, is absent or\ndeferred. \u201cHesitation\u201d, Ricoeur says, \u201cis a\nperplexed willing seeking to orient itself\u201d (1950 [2007: 138]).\nThe decision identifies one of these possibilities as my\nproject, as the possibility I will pursue in my voluntary,\nself-motivated action that executes the decision. The decision\narticulates a project, but the project is different from the voluntary\nbodily action that realizes it. Although a decision can be separated\nin time from the action, in which case it is the capability of acting\nin conformity with the project that makes it an authentic decision, an\naction can also be spontaneous. The spontaneous action, however, is\ngenuinely a voluntary action only insofar as the agent could have\nprojected it in a situation to which the action is suitable or with\nwhich it is compatible. Put another way, the action is voluntary only\nwhen the agent can recognize an implicit decision in it, a decision\nwith its history of hesitation that could be affirmed as the potential\nproject of the action in question.\n\nSuch descriptions are well suited to explicit deliberation concurrent\nor continuous with the action, and they are well suited to means-ends\narguments about what to do. This view of deliberation was embedded in\na German law that led Adolf Reinach (1912/1913 [1989: 279]) to\nidentify some \u201cremarkable antinomies\u201d in our understanding\nof deliberation, one of which is that meritorious actions count as\nless meritorious when done without any deliberation or when done only\nafter long deliberation. If the agent takes no time to deliberate, the\nagent acts impetuously; if the agent takes too much time in\ndeliberating, the agent is insufficiently attuned to what is right to\ndo in certain kinds of circumstances. However, if deliberation is\nviewed less as an occurrent rational calculation, Reinach\u2019s\nparadoxical conclusion can be avoided.\n\nNot all actions are the result of explicit deliberation. There are\nvarious ways reasons for action might be at work in action, ways that\nmight involve, say, views about the constituents of an end or views\nabout what conduces to an end. Moral agents inherit a set of views\nthat come to govern their actions without further deliberation. A\nreflective moral agent strives toward confirming for herself these\ninherited judgments, beliefs, and emotional attitudes regarding moral\ngoods and moral actions, and on this basis, she adopts, rejects, or\nrevises them. They thereby take on the character not merely of\npassively accepted moral beliefs but of justified moral convictions,\nand the agent realizes herself as a person having a particular set of\nconvictions for which the appropriate evidence has been secured and\nwhich now defines her character. These convictions inform her\nsubsequent judgments, valuations, and volitions, disposing her to act\nin determinate ways. Having over time already reflectively weighed the\nvalue of competing goods and the rightness or wrongness of various\nkinds of actions, a reflective agent, just as much as the agent who\npassively accepts beliefs, need not form a means-end argument or\nexplicitly deliberate concurrently, but her awareness of her beliefs\nand actions as justified differs from that of the passively accepting\nagent.\n\nReasons of this kind dispose the agent to expect certain features in\ncertain kinds of situations, to pick out what is salient in those\nsituations, to have certain kinds of attitudes toward them, and to act\nin typical ways. In the manner of Aristotle\u2019s brave soldier\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1117a17\u201322), the agent just\nrecognizes the situation and knows what to do without further ado.\nHence, the claim that an action is considered less meritorious when\ndone without occurrent deliberation is false. Prior\nreflection and evaluation yield the sense of a specific\naction\u2014that is, a certain kind of action\u2014as\nappropriate for the particular circumstances in which an agent finds\nherself. It is the perceptual and emotional grasp of those\ncircumstances that further determines the agent\u2019s choice to\nfollow a particular course of action to achieve her\n ends.[18]\n\nThe phenomenology of moral deliberation has also been a basis for\narguing against certain metaethical views including non-cognitivism\nand in favor of a realist moral metaphysics. For example, Jonathan\nDancy writes:\n\n\nIn moral choice we struggle to find, not any answer that we can bring\nourselves to accept, nor any answer that we can accept in consistency\nwith previous answers, but the right answer. We present our search to\nourselves as one governed by a criterion which does not lie in\nourselves; our fear is that we may make the wrong choice, a fear not\nallayed by the thought that we might make that choice quite happily\nand/or consistently with previous choices. Why otherwise should moral\nchoice be so dodgy? Why otherwise should I agonize about what is the\nright thing to do in the circumstances? Non-cognitivism leaves moral\nlife too easy, and is inconsistent with the phenomenology. It distorts\nour sense of the authority that the action which we choose as right\nhas over us. That authority is one to which our choice must conform,\nand cannot itself depend on our choice; our choice is a recognition of\nan authority which it could not itself create. (Dancy 1986:\n172\u2013173; see also Nagel 1986: 149 and Enoch 2011: 73\u201375\nfor a similar argument)\n\n\nViews that attribute realist purport to the phenomenal character of\nmoral deliberation as well as to moral emotion, and moral judgment on\nthe basis of introspection alone are challenged by Horgan and Timmons\n(2008b, 2019)\n",
