    "main_text": "Corporate moral agency\n2. Corporate moral agency\n\nOne way to think about business ethics is in terms of the moral\nobligations of agents engaged in business activity. Who can be a moral\nagent? Individual persons, obviously. What about firms? This is\ntreated as the issue of \u201ccorporate moral agency\u201d or\n\u201ccorporate moral responsibility\u201d. Here\n\u2018corporate\u2019 does not refer to the corporation as a legal\nentity, but to a collective or group of individuals. To be precise,\nthe question is whether firms are moral agents and morally responsible\nconsidered as (qua) firms, not considered as aggregates of\nindividual members of firms.\n\nWe often think and speak as if corporations are morally responsible.\nWe say things like \u201cCostco treats its employees well\u201d or\n\u201cBP harmed the environment in the Gulf of Mexico\u201d, and in\ndoing so we appear to assign agency and responsibility to firms\nthemselves (Dempsey 2003). We may wish to praise Costco and blame BP\nfor their behavior. But this may be just a metaphorical way of\nspeaking, or a shorthand way of referring to certain individuals who\nwork in these firms (Velasquez 1983, 2003). Corporations are different\nin many ways from paradigm moral agents, viz., people. They\ndon\u2019t have minds, for one thing, or bodies, for another. The\nquestion is whether corporations are similar enough to people to\nwarrant ascriptions of moral agency and responsibility.\n\nIn the business ethics literature, French is a seminal thinker on this\ntopic. In early work (1979, 1984), he argued that firms are morally\nresponsible for what they do, and indeed should be seen as\n\u201cfull-fledged\u201d moral persons. He bases this conclusion on\nhis claim that firms have internal decision-making structures, through\nwhich they cause events to happen, and act intentionally. Some early\nresponses to French\u2019s work accepted the claim that firms are\nmoral agents, but denied that they are moral persons. Donaldson (1982)\nclaims that firms cannot be persons because they lack important human\ncapacities, such as the ability to pursue their own happiness (see\nalso Werhane 1985). Other responses went further and denied that firms\nare moral agents. Velasquez (1983, 2003) argues that, while\ncorporations can act, they cannot be held responsible for their\nactions, because those actions are brought about by the actions of\ntheir members. In later work, French (1995) recanted his claim that\nfirms are moral persons, though not his claim that they are moral\nagents.\n\nDebate about corporate moral agency and moral responsibility rages on\nin important new work (Orts & Smith 2017; Sepinwall 2016). One\nissue that has received sustained attention is choice. Appealing to\ndiscursive dilemmas, List & Pettit (2011) argue that the decisions\nof corporations can be independent of the decisions of their members\n(see also Copp 2006). This makes the corporation an autonomous agent,\nand since it can choose in the light of values, a morally responsible\none. Another issue is intention. A minimal condition of moral agency\nis the ability to form intentions. Some deny that corporations can\nform them (S. Miller 2006; R\u00f6nnegard 2015). If we regard an\nintention as a mental state, akin to a belief or desire, or a\nbelief/desire complex, they may be right. But not if we regard an\nintention in functionalist terms (Copp 2006; Hess 2014), as a plan\n(Bratman 1993), or in terms of reasons-responsiveness (Silver\nforthcoming). A third issue is emotion. Sepinwall (2017) argues that\nbeing capable of emotion is a necessary condition of moral\nresponsibility, and since corporations aren\u2019t capable of\nemotion, they aren\u2019t morally responsible. Again, much depends on\nwhat it means to be capable of emotion. If this capability can be\ngiven a functionalist reading, as Bj\u00f6rnsson & Hess (2017)\nclaim, perhaps corporations are capable of emotion (see also Gilbert\n2000). Pursuit of these issues lands one in the robust and\nsophisticated literature on collective responsibility and\nintentionality, where firms feature as a type of collective. (See the\nentries on\n collective responsibility,\n collective intentionality, and\n shared agency.)\n\nAnother question asked about corporate moral agency is: Does it\nmatter? Perhaps BP itself was morally responsible for polluting the\nGulf of Mexico. Perhaps certain individuals at BP were. What hangs on\nthis? Some say: a lot. In some cases there may be no individual who is\nmorally responsible for the firm\u2019s behavior (List & Pettit\n2011; Phillips 1995), and we need someone to blame, and perhaps\npunish. Blame may be the fitting response, and blame (and punishment)\nincentivizes the firm to change its behavior. Hasnas (2012) says very\nlittle hangs on this question. Even if firms are not morally\nresponsible for the harms they cause, we can still require them to pay\nrestitution, condemn their culture, and subject them to regulation.\nMoreover, Hasnas says, we should not blame and punish firms, for our\nblame and punishment inevitably lands on the innocent.\n",
