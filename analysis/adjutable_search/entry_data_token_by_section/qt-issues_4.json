Entanglement, nonlocality, and nonseparability\n\nGiven two disjoint physical systems, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\nwith which we associate Hilbert spaces \\(H_{A}\\) and\n\\(H_{B}\\), the Hilbert space associated with the composite system is\nthe tensor product space, denoted \\(H_{A} \\otimes H_{B}\\).\n\nWhen the two systems are independently prepared in pure states\n\\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\), the state of the composite system\nis the product state \\(\\ket{\\psi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi}\\)\n(sometimes written with the cross, \\(\\otimes\\), omitted).\n\nIn addition to the product states, the tensor product space contains\nlinear combinations of product states, that is, state vectors of the\nform \n\n\\[ a\\ket{\\psi_{1}} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_{1}} + b\\ket{\\psi_{2}} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_{2}} \\]\n\n\nThe tensor product space can be defined as the smallest Hilbert space\ncontaining all of the product states. Any pure state represented by a\nstate vector that is not a product vector is an entangled\nstate.\n\nThe state of the composite system assigns probabilities to outcomes of\nall experiments that can be performed on the composite system. We can\nalso consider a restriction to experiments performed on system \\(A\\),\nor a restriction to experiments performed to \\(B\\).  Such restrictions\nyields states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively, called the reduced\nstates of the systems. When the state of the composite system\n\\(AB\\) is an entangled state, then the reduced states of \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are mixed states. To see this, suppose that in the above state\nthe vectors \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}\\) represent\ndistinguishable states. If one confines one\u2019s attention to\nexperiments performed on \\(A\\), it makes no difference whether an\nexperiment is also performed on \\(B\\). An experiment performed on\n\\(B\\) that distinguishes \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}\\)\nprojects the state of \\(A\\) into either \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) or\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), with probabilities \\(\\abs{a}^{2}\\) and\n\\(\\abs{b}^{2}\\), respectively, and probabilities for outcomes of\nexperiments performed on \\(A\\) are the corresponding averages of\nprobabilities for states \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\). These probabilities, as mentioned, are the same as\nthose for the situation in which no experiment is performed on\n\\(B\\). Thus, even if no experiment is performed on \\(B\\), the\nprobabilities of outcomes of experiments on \\(A\\) are exactly as if\nsystem \\(A\\) is either in the state represented by \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\)\nor the state represented by \\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), with probabilities\n\\(\\abs{a}^{2}\\) and \\(\\abs{b}^{2}\\), respectively.\n\nIn general, any state, pure or mixed, that is neither a product state\nnor a mixture of product states, is called an entangled\nstate.\n\nThe existence of pure entangled states means that, if we consider a\ncomposite system consisting of spatially separated parts, then, even\nwhen the state of the system is a pure state, the state is not\ndetermined by the reduced states of its component parts. Thus, quantum\nstates exhibit a form of nonseparability. See the entry on\n holism and nonseparability in physics\n for more information.\n\nQuantum entanglement results in a form of nonlocality that is alien to\nclassical physics. Even if we assume that the reduced states of \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) do not completely\ncharacterize their physical states, but must be supplemented by some\nfurther variables, there are quantum correlations that cannot be\nreduced to correlations between states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\);\nsee the entries on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem\n and\n action at a distance in quantum mechanics.\n",
