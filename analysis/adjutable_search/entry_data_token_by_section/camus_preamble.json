    "main_text": "\n\nAlbert Camus (1913\u20131960) was a journalist, editor and\neditorialist, playwright and director, novelist and author of short\nstories, political essayist and activist\u2014and, although he more\nthan once denied it, a philosopher. He ignored or opposed systematic\nphilosophy, had little faith in rationalism, asserted rather than\nargued many of his main ideas, presented others in metaphors, was\npreoccupied with immediate and personal experience, and brooded over\nsuch questions as the meaning of life in the face of death. Although\nhe forcefully separated himself from existentialism, Camus posed one\nof the twentieth century\u2019s best-known existentialist questions,\nwhich launches The Myth of Sisyphus: \u201cThere is only one\nreally serious philosophical question, and that is suicide\u201d\n(MS, 3). And his philosophy of the absurd has left us with a\nstriking image of the human fate: Sisyphus endlessly pushing his rock\nup the mountain only to see it roll back down each time he gains the\ntop. Camus\u2019s philosophy found political expression in The\nRebel, which along with his newspaper editorials, political\nessays, plays, and fiction earned him a reputation as a great\nmoralist. It also embroiled him in conflict with his friend, Jean-Paul\nSartre, provoking the major political-intellectual divide of the\nCold-War era as Camus and Sartre became, respectively, the leading\nintellectual voices of the anti-Communist and pro-Communist left.\nFurthermore, in posing and answering urgent philosophical questions of\nthe day, Camus articulated a critique of religion and of the\nEnlightenment and all its projects, including Marxism. In 1957 he won\nthe Nobel Prize for literature. He died in a car accident in January,\n1960, at the age of 46.\n",
