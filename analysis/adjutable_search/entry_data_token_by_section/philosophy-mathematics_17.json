    "main_text": "Structuralism and Nominalism || Fictionalism\n4.5 Fictionalism\n\nAccording to the previous proposals, the statements of ordinary\nmathematics are true when suitably, i.e., nominalistically,\ninterpreted. The nominalistic account of mathematics that will now be\ndiscussed holds that all existential mathematical statements are false\nsimply because there are no mathematical entities. (For the same\nreason all universal mathematical statements will be trivially\ntrue.)\n\nFictionalism holds that mathematical theories are like fiction stories\nsuch as fairy tales and novels. Mathematical theories describe\nfictional entities, in the same way that literary fiction describes\nfictional characters. This position was first articulated in the\nintroductory chapter of (Field 1989), and has in recent years been\ngaining in popularity.\n\nThis crude description of the fictionalist position immediately opens\nup the question what sort of entities fictional entities are. This\nappears to be a deep metaphysical ontological problem. One way to\navoid this question altogether is to deny that there exist fictional\nentities. Mathematical theories should be viewed as invitations to\nparticipate in games of pretence, in which we act as if certain\nmathematical entities exist. Pretence or make-believe operators shield\ntheir propositional objects from existential exportation (Leng\n2010).\n\nAnyway, as said above, on the fictionalist view, a mathematical theory\nisn\u2019t literally true. Nonetheless, mathematics is used to get\ntruths across. So we must subtract something from what is\nliterally said when we assert a physical theory that involves\nmathematics, if we want to get at the truth. But this requires a\ntheory of how this subtraction of content works. Such a\ntheory has been developed in (Yablo, 2014).\n\nIf the fictionalist thesis is correct, then one demand that must be\nimposed on mathematical theories is surely consistency. Yet Field adds\nto this a second requirement: mathematics must be\nconservative over natural science. This means, roughly, that\nwhenever a statement of an empirical theory can be derived using\nmathematics, it can in principle also be derived without using any\nmathematical theories. If this were not the case, then an\nindispensability argument could be played out against fictionalism.\nWhether mathematics is in fact conservative over physics, for\ninstance, is currently a matter of controversy. Shapiro has formulated\nan incompleteness argument that intends to refute Field\u2019s claim\n(Shapiro 1983).\n\nIf there are indeed no mathematical (fictional) entities, as one form\nof fictionalism has it, then Benacerraf\u2019s epistemological\nproblem does not arise. Fictionalism then shares this advantage over\nmost forms of platonism with nominalistic reconstructions of\nmathematics. But the appeal to pretence operators entails that the\nlogical form of mathematical sentences then differs somewhat from\ntheir surface form. If there are fictional objects, then the surface\nform of mathematical sentences can be taken to coincide with their\nlogical form. But if they exist as abstract entities, then\nBenacerraf\u2019s epistemological problem reappears.\n\nWhether Benacerraf\u2019s identification problem is solved is not\ncompletely clear. In general, fictionalism is a non-reductionist\naccount. Whether an entity in one mathematical theory is identical\nwith an entity that occurs in another theory is usually left\nindeterminate by mathematical \u201cstories\u201d. Yet Burgess has\nrightly emphasized that mathematics differs from literary fiction in\nthe fact that fictional characters are usually confined to one work of\nfiction, whereas the same mathematical entities turn up in diverse\nmathematical theories (Burgess 2004). After all, entities with the\nsame name (such as \\(\\pi)\\) turn up in different theories.\nPerhaps the fictionalist can maintain that when mathematicians develop\na new theory in which an \u201cold\u201d mathematical entity occurs,\nthe entity in question is made more precise. More determinate\nproperties are ascribed to it than before, and this is all right as\nlong as overall consistency is maintained.\n\nThe canonical objection to formalism seems also applicable to\nfictionalism. The fictionalists should find some explanation of the\nfact that extending a mathematical theory in one way, is often\nconsidered preferable over continuing it in a another way that is\nincompatible with the first. There is often at least an appearance\nthat there is a right way to extend a mathematical theory.\n",
