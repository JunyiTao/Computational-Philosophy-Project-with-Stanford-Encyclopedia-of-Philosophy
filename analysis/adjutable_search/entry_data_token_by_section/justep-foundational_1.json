    "main_text": "The Classical Analysis of Foundational Justification\n2. The Classical Analysis of Foundational Justification\n\nFoundationalists are united in their conviction that there must be a\nkind of justification that does not depend on the having of\njustification for other beliefs. They nevertheless disagree radically\namong themselves as to how to understand foundational justification.\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, the rise of\nexternalist epistemologies has generated even more fundamentally\ndifferent versions of foundationalism. It will not be possible to\nsurvey all of the strikingly different analyses or theories that have\nbeen offered of foundational justification. In what follows we will\nexamine a few of the more prominent versions of classical and\ncontemporary internalist and externalist foundationalism.\n",
