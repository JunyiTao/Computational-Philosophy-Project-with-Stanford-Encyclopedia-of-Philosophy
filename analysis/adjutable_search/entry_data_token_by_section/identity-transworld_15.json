    "main_text": "Transworld identity and the transitivity of identity\n5. Transworld identity and the transitivity of identity\n\nIt was argued above that the proponent of transworld identity without\nnon-trivial individual essences faces the prospect of bare\n(\u2018ungrounded\u2019) identities across possible worlds. One such\nargument is Chisholm\u2019s Paradox, which relies on the transitivity\nof identity to produce the result that a series of small changes in\nthe properties of Adam and Noah leads to a world in which Adam and\nNoah have swapped their roles. However, the transitivity of identity\ngenerates additional problems concerning transworld identity, some of\nwhich have nothing particularly to do with role-switching\npossibilities or bare identities.\n",
