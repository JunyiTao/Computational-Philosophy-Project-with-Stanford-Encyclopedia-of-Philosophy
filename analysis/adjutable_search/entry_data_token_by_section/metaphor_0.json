Naming of Parts\n\nBut soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\n\nIt is the east and Juliet is the sun!\n\n(William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, 2. 2. 2\u20133)\n\n\n\u2014History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to\nawake.\n\n(James Joyce, Ulysses, chap. 2)\n\n\nA work is a death mask of its conception.\n\n(Walter Benjamin, Einbahnstra\u00dfe)\n\n\nWhen we resort to metaphor, we contrive to talk about two things at\nonce; two different and disparate subject matters are mingled to rich\nand unpredictable effect. One of these subject matters is already\nunder discussion or at least up for consideration when a speaker\nresorts to metaphor in the first place. This is the metaphor\u2019s\nprimary subject or tenor: the young girl Juliet in\nthe case of Romeo\u2019s metaphor; history, Ireland\u2019s history\nor the world\u2019s, in the case of Stephen\u2019s; works, prose\nwritings in general, in the case of Benjamin\u2019s. The second\nsubject matter is newly introduced with an eye to temporarily\nenriching our resources for thinking and talking about the first. This\nis the metaphor\u2019s secondary subject or\nvehicle: the sun; nightmares from which one tries to awake;\ndeath masks, i.e., death masks in general. The primary subject of a\nmetaphor may be a particular thing, or it may be a whole kind of\nthing, and likewise for the secondary subject\u2014with the result\nthat the metaphor itself may take the verbal form of an identity\nstatement (X is Y) as with Romeo; a predication or membership\nstatement (X is a G) as with Stephen Daedalus; or a statement\nof inclusion (Fs are Gs) as with Benjamin.\n\nIf we ask how primary and secondary subjects are brought into relation\nby being spoken of together in a metaphor, it seems natural to say\nthat metaphor is a form of likening, comparing, or\nanalogizing. The maker of a metaphor (or the metaphor itself)\nlikens the primary subject to the secondary subject: Romeo (or\nRomeo\u2019s speech) likens Juliet to the sun, Stephen likens history\nto nightmares, Benjamin likens works in prose to death masks. But it\nis unclear what we mean when we say this, to the point where some are\nreluctant to appeal to likeness or similarity in explaining what\nmetaphor is or how it works. Much of the power and interest of many a\ngood metaphor derives from how massively and conspicuously different\nits two subject matters are, to the point where metaphor is sometimes\ndefined by those with no pretensions to originality as \u201ca\ncomparison of two unlike things.\u201d The interpretation of\na metaphor often turns not on properties the secondary subject\nactually has or even on ones it is believed to have but instead on\nones we habitually pretend it to have: think of what happens when we\ncall someone a gorilla.\n\nMetaphor is but one of many techniques, named and unnamed, for\nlikening one thing to another by means of words. We may employ an\nexplicit comparison of one thing to another, built around\nlike, as, or some other explicit comparative\nconstruction, in what\u2019s known as simile:\n\nOne walking a fall meadow finds on all sides\n\nThe Queen-Anne\u2019s lace lying like lilies on water.\n\n(Richard Wilbur, \u201cThe Beautiful Changes\u201d)\n\n\nHe looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a\nslice of angel food.\n\n(Raymond Chandler, Farewell, My Lovely, chap. 1)\n\n\nWe may interweave parallel observations about two different subject\nmatters by means of so and too and thus. We\nmay liken a whole bunch of things to one another by making\nconspicuously parallel statements about each, inviting our listener to\nregister the parallelism and ponder its significance. Or we may simply\njuxtapose mention of a first thing with mention of a second in a\nsuitably conspicuous and suggestive manner:\n\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd;\n\nPetals on a wet, black bough.\n\n(Ezra Pound, In a Station of The Metro)\n\n\nPart of what is distinctive about metaphorical likening in\nparticular is that in resorting to it, we speak of one thing or kind\n(the primary subject) as and in terms of a second\nthing or kind (the secondary subject). Our deployment of language\ntakes place as if primary subject and secondary subject\n(Juliet and the sun) were one and the same; or as if the\nprimary subject (history) were an instance of the secondary subject\n(nightmares); or as if the primary subject (works) were\nincluded within the secondary subject (death masks). In this sense,\nthe primary subject is spoken of as the secondary subject.\nWords, idioms, and other ways of talking customarily deployed in\nconnection with the secondary subject (the sun, death masks) are\nappropriated and redeployed for use in thinking and talking about the\nprimary subject (Juliet, prose works). In this sense, the primary\nsubject is spoken of and thought about in terms of the\nsecondary subject. It is easy to feel that in Romeo\u2019s metaphor,\nfamiliar fragments of sun-talk come to be about Juliet without ceasing\nto be about the sun. If so, the double aboutness exhibited by\nmetaphorical language is something philosophers must strive to\nunderstand.\n\nA sentence metaphor typically likens many things or kinds to many\nother things or kinds at a single verbal stroke. Benjamin\u2019s\nterse little aphorism manages to liken works to death masks,\nconceptions to living human beings, the changes a conception undergoes\nbefore being incorporated into a finished work to life, the\nstabilization and stultification it allegedly undergoes after such\nincorporation to death\u2014and so on. In the context provided by the\nrest of his speech, Romeo\u2019s exclamation manages to liken Juliet\nto the sun, her room and balcony to the east, Romeo himself to\ncreatures dependent on the sun for warmth and light and nurturance,\nRomeo\u2019s old love Rosaline to that lesser light the moon, the\nsight of Juliet to the light of the sun, Juliet\u2019s appearance at\nher window as the sun\u2019s rising in the east\u2014and so on. Only\nsome of a metaphor\u2019s primary subjects and some of its secondary\nsubjects are explicitly referred to by any verbal expression contained\ntherein. Listeners must work the others out for themselves. In this\nrespect, every metaphor leaves something implicit.\n\nNevertheless, some metaphors are explicit in the sense that\nthey liken one or more named things or kinds to one or more other\nnamed things or kinds by means of locutions regularly found in overt\nliteral statements of identity, membership, or inclusion:\n\nI am a moth and you are a flame.\n\n\nI, Ahab, am a speeding locomotive.\n\n\nwhile other metaphors are implicit in that they eschew such\nsimple alignments, mingling primary subject language and secondary\nsubject language almost at random, yet in such a way as to leave\nlisteners able to work out which is which and what\u2019s being\nlikened to what else:\n\nI shall flutter helplessly closer and closer until you burn me to\ndeath at last.\n\n\nThe path of my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul\nis grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of\nmountains, under torrents\u2019 beds, unerringly I rush.\nNaught\u2019s an obstacle, naught\u2019s an angle to the iron way!\n\n\u2014Ahab (Melville, Moby-Dick, chap. 38)\n\n\nWithin the confines of a given metaphor, we distinguish pretty readily\nbetween words and phrases that are to be taken metaphorically and\nothers that are to be taken only literally. To take an expression\nmetaphorically is one way to take it figuratively, and to take an\nexpression figuratively is to reinterpret it, to construe it\nin a manner that departs from but remains informed by some relevant\nprior literal construal of it. Various other kinds of figurative\nreinterpretation are exhibited in various other recognized figures of\nspeech: metonymy (This policy covers you from the cradle to\nthe grave), irony (You\u2019re a fine friend),\nhyperbole (loud enough to wake the dead), and so on.\n\nThe portion of a metaphor that undergoes figurative reinterpretation\nis its focus and the rest is its frame. The focus of\na metaphor may be a single word drawn from almost any part of speech.\nIt may be a multi-word phrase like the sun or death\nmask. It may consist of scattered parts of an extended sentence,\nthe remainder of which is to be taken only literally:\n\nIf, baby, I\u2019m the bottom, you\u2019re the\ntop. (Cole Porter)\n\n\nThe path of my fixed purpose is laid with iron\nrails, where on my soul is grooved to\nrun.\n\n\nOr it may be an extended phrase, rich in internal syntactic\nstructure:\n\nAn aged man is but a paltry thing,\n\nA tattered coat upon a stick \u2026\n\n(W.B. Yeats, \u201cSailing to Byzantium\u201d)\n\n\nPhilosophers need to elucidate (a) the nature of the difference\nbetween taking language literally and taking it metaphorically, the\nnature, if you will, of the reinterpretation language undergoes when\nwe take it metaphorically, and (b) the nature of the division of\nexpressive labor between a metaphor\u2019s focus and its frame.\n\nLiterary theorists regularly acknowledge the existence of\nextended metaphors, unitary metaphorical likenings that\nsprawl over multiple successive sentences. There are also\ncontracted metaphors, metaphors that run their course within\nthe narrow confines of a single clause or phrase or word. They reveal\nthemselves most readily when distinct metaphors are mixed to\npowerful, controlled, anything but hilarious effect:\n\nPhilosophy is the battle against [the bewitchment of\nour intelligence by means of our language]. (Wittgenstein,\nPhilosophical Investigations, \u00a7109)\n\n\nNot all sentence metaphors take the form of declarative sentences by\nany means: there are metaphorical questions, metaphorical commands,\nmetaphorical optatives, etc. Despite such complications, modern\nmetaphor theory tends to treat the freestanding declarative\nmetaphorical sentence as the fundamental unit of metaphorical\naction.\n",
