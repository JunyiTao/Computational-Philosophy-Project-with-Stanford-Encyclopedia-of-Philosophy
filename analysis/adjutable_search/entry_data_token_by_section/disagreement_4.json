Epistemic peers with respect to \\(P\\)\nare in an equally good epistemic position with respect to \\(P\\). Peers\nabout \\(P\\) can both be in a very good epistemic position with respect\nto \\(P\\), or they could both be in a particularly bad epistemic\nposition with respect to \\(P\\). Put differently, two fools could be\npeers. However, disagreement between fool peers has not been of\nparticular epistemic interest in the literature. The literature on\npeer disagreement has instead focused on disagreement between\ncompetent epistemic peers, where competent peers with respect to \\(P\\)\nare in a good epistemic position with respect to \\(P\\)\u2014they are\nlikely to be correct about \\(P\\). Our discussion of peer disagreement\nwill be restricted to competent peer disagreement. In the\nliterature on peer disagreements, four main views have emerged: the\nEqual Weight View, the Steadfast View, the Justificationist View, and\nthe Total Evidence View.\n",
