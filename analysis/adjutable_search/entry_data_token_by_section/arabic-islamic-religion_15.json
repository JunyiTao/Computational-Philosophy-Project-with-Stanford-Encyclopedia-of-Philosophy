    "main_text": "Religious/theological language || Early approaches to theological language\n6.1 Early approaches to theological language\n\nThe earliest developments in Islamic theological language emphasized\nGod\u2019s absolute unity/simplicity (taw\u1e25\u012bd) and\nperhaps most importantly, since God is unlike creatures\n(mukh\u0101lafa li-l-\u1e25aw\u0101dith), his transcendence\n(tanz\u012bh). The proponents of divine transcendence, the\neponymous Jahmiyya, named after the movement\u2019s founder Jahm ibn\n\u1e62afw\u0101n (696\u2013745), denied that God has any attributes\n(see Sch\u00f6ck 2016: 55\u201377). Consequently, critics referred to\nthese theologians as apophaticists\n(Mu\u02bfa\u1e6d\u1e6dila, literally, \u2018those who\nvoid\u2019) to indicate that this position voids religious texts of\ntheir literal meaning since God transcends anything that we can say or\nunderstand about him. In response to this emphasis on divine\ntranscendence, there emerged those who stressed a hyper-literal\nreading of Qur\u2019anic verses\u2014such as Qur\u2019an 48: 10\n& 38, 71; 2: 115 and 11: 37 with their references to God\u2019s\nhands, face and eyes respectively\u2014and the prophetic traditions.\nBased on a literal reading, they made God similar to creatures and\nascribed to him a physical body, and so were labeled anthropomorphists\n(mushabbiha, literally, \u2018simulators\u2019) and\ncorporealists (mujassima) (see Van Ess 2000). A reaction to\nthese two earlier positions was that of the traditionalist\n(salaf\u012b) who claimed to follow the example of the\nearliest generation (salaf) of Muslims, i.e., the companions\nof the Prophet and the followers of the companions. They attempted to\nprovide a middle path between the apophatic and anthropomorphic\nunderstandings of God. They wanted neither to void the Qur\u2019an of\nits literal meaning by emphasizing divine transcendence nor to make\nGod similar to bodily creatures by taking the Qur\u2019an out of its\nbroader theological context. In general, they maintained that while\none knows that God has the various anthropomorphic characters\nthat the Qur\u2019an attributes to him, one should not delve into\nhow (kayf) God has those attributes, i.e., their\nmode of existence. All the major approaches developed later in the\nmedieval Islamic world, such as those of the Mu\u02bftazilites,\nAsh\u02bfarites, Maturidites and philosophers, can be traced back to\nand are modifications of these three approaches (Winter 2008:\n33\u2013141; Rudolph 1996 [2015]: 23\u2013121; and Watt 1973:\n242\u201350, 279\u2013318; 1992: 46\u201355, 64\u201397).\n\nUnderlying the apophatic, anthropomorphic and traditionalist positions\nabout divine attributes is a common assumption, namely, when one talks\nabout God and about creation, one must use univocal language. In other\nwords, it was assumed that if language is to be literal and\ninformative, properties predicated of God and of creatures must have\nexactly the same sense. Thus, if, as the Qur\u2019an purports, God\nhas hands, eyes and speaks, having hands, eyes and speaking must have\none the same meaning when predicated of God and of creatures. For\nMuslim Apophatic theologians, since we cannot take attributes\npredicated of God univocally in the way they are predicated of\ncreation, we must take them as negations about God. Conversely,\ngranting the assumption of univocal predication, Muslim\nanthropomorphists maintained it is legitimate to draw the implications\nthat God has bodily parts similar to those of creatures from the\nQur\u2019anic statements about God. Muslim Traditionalists, with the\nsame assumption, affirmed the literal meaning of religious texts that\npredicate of God creaturely properties, but they understood them as\ngoverned by the principle that God is unlike creation, and so those\nproperties that are found in creation and predicated of God may be\nacknowledged without additionally drawing their ordinary\nimplications.\n",
