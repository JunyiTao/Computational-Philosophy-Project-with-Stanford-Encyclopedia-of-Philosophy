Three Medieval Problems\n\nThe three problems that will be discussed now in more detail\u2014the\neternity of the world; divine omniscience and human freedom; the soul\nand immortality\u2014have been chosen for three reasons. They were\neach considered very important in all the traditions of medieval\nphilosophy. They are, in the form discussed, specifically medieval\n(given the long and broad understanding of the Middle Ages advocated\nhere), although closely linked to philosophical issues discussed\nbefore and since. Moreover\u2014and it is for this reason above all\nthat these three topics and not others were selected\u2014they each\ncast a light on how religious concerns interacted with reasoning and\non the different ways in which this took place within the spheres of\neach of the different religious traditions, and between these\nspheres.\n",
