    "main_text": "Principles and Theories || Reflective Equilibrium without Principles?\n2.4 Reflective Equilibrium without Principles?\n\nThe standard construal of reflective equilibrium seeks a\ntheoretically-driven balance between judgments and principles. It is\ntherefore unsurprising that it has been opposed by\nanti-theorists, who set themselves against \u201can approach\nto ethical enquiry that seeks a systematizing account of correct\nethical thought and practice\u201d (Robertson 2017: 678). Bernard\nWilliams objected that Rawls\u2019 reflective equilibrium failed to\ndeliver mutually acceptable principles (Williams 1985: 110\u2013116),\nwhile Annette Baier was\n\n\nnot content, like Rawls (1971: 50) to retreat to the aim of finding a\ntheory that accommodates all my considered judgments, while\nresigning myself to the likelihood that yours are different and\nrequire a different theory. (Baier 1985: 140)\n\n\nThis criticism of reflective equilibrium may be misplaced. Williams\nappears to \u201cconflate Rawls\u2019s contractualism with his\ncoherentist justification\u201d (Clarke 1987: 243). It is\nRawls\u2019 original position, not his reflective equilibrium, which\naims to provide principles for a well-ordered society. Reflective\nequilibrium has no commitment to contractualism or justificatory\ndevices generally; these are useful, where they are, simply because\nthey place conditions on practical reason that the individual\ndeliberator finds appealing. This may, however, seem to put reflective\nequilibrium in Baier\u2019s sights, and in danger of solipsism; this\nconcern is addressed below in the discussion of public reflective\nequilibrium.\n\nWhile reflective equilibrium is not committed to devices of\njustification, it is usually understood as being committed to\nprinciples. Rawls and Daniels understand an equilibrium as between\njudgments and principles, so if there are no principles, there can be\nno equilibrium. This could, nevertheless, be seen as an arbitrary\nrestriction on moral deliberation. Someone might be convinced by\nanti-theory, so that their considered judgments will settle on no\nmoral principles, maintaining that ethics should be more local and\npractical. A supplementary line of thought inspired by foundationalism\nmight suggest that principles are superfluous to the method because\nthe real balance is struck between judgments. Such principle-less\nmoral conclusions do not seem admissible on the standard understanding\nof reflective equilibrium. It is not clear why the formal category of\nprinciples should be considered untouchable when everything else,\nincluding the entire content of all principles and the background\ntheories by which they are assessed, is available for revision.\n\nWe might, then, consider whether reflective equilibrium is possible\nwithout principles. On one view the core of reflective equilibrium is\ninspired by Socrates\u2019 transformation of his pupils\u2019\n\u201cinarticulate hunches into fully explicit beliefs\u201d\n(Schroeter 2004: 121). This \u201cmaieutic reflection\u201d makes\nour inchoate moral notions more precise; sometimes we will endorse\nthem, but at other times we may find they conflict and revise some of\nthem. Maieutic reflection is a valuable tool of moral enquiry even if\nthere is no \u201cstable resting point\u201d and no intention to\nbuild a moral theory (Schroeter 2004: 122). Even antitheorists could\nuse this method. An apparent qualification is that\nconstructivists\u2014those that hold that \u201cmoral facts are\nepistemically constrained\u201d (Schroeter 2004: 111)\u2014are\ncommitted to moral theory after all.\n\nCuriously, the index of Rawls\u2019 Political Liberalism\nprovides a concise statement of a principle-less method:\n\u201cReflective equilibrium: defined as when judgments at all levels\nof generality are in line on due reflection\u201d (Rawls 2005: 514).\nRather than bringing principles and judgments into agreement, as per\nRawls\u2019 official position, this variant would only bring\njudgments into agreement with each other. This would still allow us to\nretain major justificatory elements of wide reflective equilibrium,\narriving at a coherent set of considered judgments revised in light of\na wide range of competing principles, arguments, and background\ntheories. The only difference is that our judgments are not\nnecessarily represented in principles. Deliberators are free to follow\nthe classic mutual adjustment of principles and judgments should they\nwish, but the output that is measured is judgments alone, \u201cat\nall levels of generality\u201d: utilitarians\u2019 one big judgment,\nanti-theorists\u2019 countless smaller ones, and every position in\nbetween.\n",
