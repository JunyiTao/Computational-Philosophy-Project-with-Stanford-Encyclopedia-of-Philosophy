    "main_text": "Ethics || Indifferents\n4.3 Indifferents\n\nThis sketch of Stoic eudaimonism allows us to better appreciate two of\ntheir most contentious ethical doctrines: (1) human happiness is fully\nin our power and (2) virtue is the only good.\n\nRecall that, for the Stoics, the possession of knowledge depends\nsolely on the agent\u2019s acts of assent, and all acts of assent are\nin the agent\u2019s power (see above,\n 2.8\n and\n 2.9).\n So if virtue is knowledge and both necessary and sufficient for\nhappiness, it follows that happiness will also be in the agent\u2019s\npower and entirely up to them.\n\nLet us grant for the sake of argument that virtue and knowledge are in\nthe agent\u2019s power. Even so, one might object that it is\nimpossible to be happy in the midst of grave misfortune and material\ndeprivation: a terminally ill patient racked with pain, impoverished\nfrom medical bills, and reviled by all of society cannot be happy,\neven if he is virtuous. This intuitive thought led Academic and\nPeripatetic philosophers working in the eudaimonist tradition to argue\nthat, while virtue is necessary for happiness, it is not sufficient,\nor to recognize different degrees of happiness and hold that, while\nvirtue is necessary and sufficient for a minimal amount of happiness,\nit does not suffice for full or maximal happiness (cf. Cicero, De\nFinibus 5.77; Seneca, Moral Letters 85.18\u201323). On these\nviews, some things other than virtue and lying outside the\nagent\u2019s power \u2013 i.e. his share of \u201cexternal\ngoods\u201d \u2013 will make a difference to his happiness.\n\nThe Stoics reject such approaches:\n\n\nThey [the Stoics] say that some existing things are good, others are\nbad, and others are neither of these. The virtues \u2013 prudence,\njustice, courage, moderation and the rest \u2013 are good. The\nopposites of these \u2013 foolishness, injustice and the rest \u2013\nare bad. Everything which neither does benefit nor harms is neither of\nthese: for instance, life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth,\nreputation, noble birth, and their opposites, death, disease, pain,\nugliness, weakness, poverty, low repute, ignoble birth and the like.\nFor just as heating, not chilling is the peculiar characteristic of\nwhat is hot, so too benefiting, not harming is the peculiar\ncharacteristic of what is good. But wealth and health no more do\nbenefit than they harm. Therefore wealth and health are not something\ngood. (Diogenes Laertius, 58A)\n\n\nIn sharp contrast with eudaimonist theories which regard health,\nwealth, reputation, etc. as \u201cexternal goods\u201d, the Stoics\nmaintain that such items are neither good nor bad and, thus,\n\u201cindifferent\u201d (adiaphora /\nindifferentia) to human happiness. To establish this\nconclusion, the Stoics do not rely on the claim that wealth, for\ninstance, sometimes benefits and sometimes harms the\nagent. Instead, the Stoic position is that wealth \u201cneither does\nbenefit nor harms\u201d: in no case is a human life ever made better\nor worse by the possession or deprivation of wealth (or health or\nreputation etc.). Just as what is hot necessarily provides heat, so\ntoo what is good necessarily provides benefit (cf. Sextus, 60G). The\nStoics\u2019 fundamental axiological thesis, then, is that only\nvirtue benefits a human being and makes our lives go well, so only\nvirtue is good.\n\nThe Greek Stoics were prolific in crafting arguments in support of\nthis thesis, a number of which survive in our sources (e.g. Cicero,\n60N; see also Seneca, Moral Letters 82, 85, and 87). Among\nother strategies, Chrysippus appealed to his account of human nature\nto show that only virtue is good, arguing that human nature is such\nthat only the perfection of reason is genuinely beneficial to us (cf.\nCicero, 64K and Brennan 2009; see also Klein 2016). In any event, the\nStoics fully embrace the conclusion that Aristotle considers too big a\nbullet to bite (cf. Nic. Eth. 1.5, 1095b33\u20131096a2):\nthey maintain that, even while being tortured on the rack, his body\nmutilated and searing with pain, and isolated from all his family and\nfriends, the virtuous person is maximally happy (Cicero, De\nFinibus 3.42). Indeed, according to the Stoics, he is equally\nhappy as he was before the torture began, since at both times he\npossesses the one thing that is really beneficial \u2013 virtue\n\u2013 despite having a different share of indifferents (physical\npain, health, etc.). Human happiness therefore does not come in\ndegrees, on the Stoic view. Provided that the agent is virtuous (and\nregardless of how long she continues to possess virtue:\nCicero, De Finibus 3.45\u20137), nothing external will\ndetract from or add to her personal flourishing.\n\nWith respect to their contribution to happiness, then, all\nindifferents are on a par (Diogenes Laertius, 58B). From this bracing\nthesis, one might be tempted to infer that there is no reason to exert\noneself in the pursuit of one type of indifferent (e.g. health) over\nits opposite (e.g. disease). While some marginal figures in\nZeno\u2019s circle endorsed this kind of absolute equality of\nindifferents, such a position was explicitly rejected by Chrysippus,\nand it did not become Stoic orthodoxy (Cicero, 58I; cf. Sextus, 58F).\nInstead, the mainstream Stoic view is that some indifferents \u2013\nsuch as health, wealth, and reputation \u2013 are of a promoted or\npreferred type (pro\u00eagmena / praeposita), have\nvalue (axia / aestimatio), and are according to\nnature (kata phusin / secundum naturam), such that\nis appropriate or dutiful or one\u2019s proper function\n(kath\u00eakon / officium) to select them over\ntheir opposites in normal circumstances (Cicero, 59D; Stobaeus 58C-E).\nFor this reason, the virtuous agent will typically pursue (e.g.)\nhealth and undertake the further steps needed to obtain it (e.g. eat\nsalad, exercise, etc.), even though her successful acquisition of\nhealth \u2013 her actually being healthy rather than unhealthy\n\u2013 makes no difference to her happiness and is neither good nor\nbad. The virtuous agent is therefore not lackadaisical in her attitude\ntoward indifferents, according to the orthodox Stoic account, but\nrather energetic and conscientious in her pursuit of those which are\npreferred, valuable, and according to nature: her general policy will\nbe to select these and reject their opposites.\n\nThe Stoics\u2019 ancient critics replied that this doctrine was\nincoherent, even confused, and it is indeed difficult to see how\nsomething could be both indifferent to our happiness and nevertheless\nrational to care about and pursue. The ancient critique of the Stoic\naccount of indifferents can be formulated as a dilemma (cf. Plutarch,\n64C; Cicero, 64F, L; see Klein 2015, Barney 2003). According to these\ncritics, there are just two ways the Stoics can explain why we should\npursue health, wealth, and other preferred indifferents, both of which\nleading to self-contradiction: either (i) these items really are good\nand directly or indirectly contribute to human happiness, or (ii)\nhappiness is not the ultimate practical goal. Option (i) makes the\npursuit of these items intelligible, on the grounds that possessing\nthem is good for human beings and happiness-affecting, but is\ninconsistent with the Stoic claim that only virtue is good. On this\noption, \u201cpreferred indifferents\u201d turn out to be external\ngoods by another name. Option (ii) respects the Stoic insistence that\nthese items are genuinely indifferent to our happiness, but sacrifices\nthe bedrock eudaimonist thesis that happiness is \u201cthe end, for\nthe sake of which everything is done\u201d (Stobaeus, 63A). On option\n(ii), indifferents are pursued for the sake of a goal independent\nfrom, and standing outside of, the agent\u2019s own happiness, but\nthis result is one that no eudaimonist school can consistently\naccept.\n\nWhether the Stoic account is ultimately impaled on these two horns\nremains the subject of ongoing scholarly debate. However, the\nepistemic interpretation of Stoic indifferents \u2013 first sketched\nby Cooper 1999a and Brennan 2005 but authoritatively presented in\nKlein 2015 \u2013 deserves further consideration here, as a promising\nattempt to rescue the Stoics from the dilemma. On this interpretation,\nthe agent is justified in selecting (e.g.) health over its contrary\nindifferent, illness, not because health is itself good or because\nthere is some happiness-independent reason to be healthy as opposed to\nsick, but instead because, for finite agents like us, who lack\nknowledge of future events, selecting promoted indifferents over their\nopposites is generally the most epistemically responsible way of\nfollowing the will of Zeus (cf. Chrysippus in Epictetus, 58J).\n\nRecall that the telos is standardly specified as\n\u201cliving in agreement with nature\u201d. Chrysippus holds that\nthis formulation is equivalent to \u201cliving in accordance with\nexperience of what happens by nature\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 63C).\nAccording to Diogenes of Babylon, the telos can also be\ndescribed as \u201creasoning well in the selection and dis-selection\nof things in accordance with nature\u201d (Stobaeus, 58K).\nDiogenes\u2019 formulation suggests that the correct\nselection of indifferents makes a positive contribution to\nhuman happiness, even though their possession does not.\nMoreover, the Stoics think that a selection can be correct even if\nZeus decides not to produce the indifferent that the agent pursues:\nlike excellent dancing, virtuous selection of indifferents does not\nrequire the acquisition of any object external to the agent in order\nto count as successful (Cicero, 64H). So, on the epistemic\ninterpretation, when the virtuous agent selects health over illness,\nshe does not act for the sake of obtaining health, as if being healthy\nrather than sick would make a difference to her flourishing, but\ninstead because pursuing health on this occasion reflects her\n\u201cexperience of what happens by nature\u201d and follows upon\nher best assessment of what conformity to Zeus\u2019 providential\ncosmic plan requires of her in this instance. (See Stobaeus 65Q, with\ndiscussion in Inwood 1985, ch. 5, and Brennan 2000, for the\n\u201creservations\u201d included in the Sage\u2019s selections of\nindifferents.)\n",
