    "main_text": "Some Fundamental Principles of Leibniz's Philosophy || Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (PII)\n3.5 Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (PII)\n\n\nPC and PSR may seem innocent enough, but Leibniz's other\nwell-known principle, the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles\n(PII), is more controversial. (See also the entry on \nidentity of indiscernibles.) \nIn one of Leibniz's typical\nformulations, PII states that \u201cit is not true that two substances\ncan resemble each other completely and differ only in number [solo\nnumero]\u201d (A VI, iv, 1541/AG 42). In other words, if two things\nshare all properties, they are identical, or  \n(\u2200F)(Fx \u2194\nFy) \u2192 x = y. \nWhat is particularly important to note,\nhowever, is that Leibniz is adamant that certain kinds of properties\nare excluded from the list of properties that could count as\ndifference-making properties, chief among these spatio-temporal\nproperties. This is what Leibniz means (in part) when he asserts that there\ncan be no purely extrinsic (i.e., relational) determinations.\nTherefore, it is not the case that there could be two chunks of matter\nthat are qualitatively identical but existing in different locations.\nIn Leibniz's view, any such extrinsic difference must be founded\non an intrinsic difference. As he puts it in the \nNew Essays,\n\n\nalthough time and place (i.e., the relations to what lies outside) do\ndistinguish for us things which we could not easily tell apart by\nreference to themselves alone, things are nevertheless distinguishable\nin themselves. Thus, although diversity in things is accompanied by\ndiversity of time or place, time and place do not constitute the core\nof identity and diversity, because they [sc. different times and\nplaces] impress different states upon the thing. To which it can be\nadded that it is by means of things that we must distinguish one time\nor place from another, rather than vice versa. (A VI vi 230/RB\n230)\n\n\nThere is also the related, though uncontroversial, Principle of the Indiscernibility of\nIdenticals: if two things are identical, then they share all\nproperties, or  x = y \u2192\n(\u2200F)(Fx\n\u2194 Fy).  The combination of these two principles\nis sometimes called \u201cLeibniz's Law\u201d: two things are\nidentical if and only if they share all properties, or\nx = y \u2194 \n(\u2200F)(Fx\n\u2194 Fy). (Sometimes, unfortunately, only the Principle of\nthe Indiscernibility of Identicals is so called.)\n\n\nIt is also interesting to note that in his Primary Truths\nand Correspondence with Clarke, Leibniz presents PII not as a bedrock\naxiom of his system but as a consequence of PC and PSR.\nBriefly, one way to sketch the argument is this:\n\n\n\n(1)\nSuppose there were two indiscernible individuals,\na and b, in our\nworld, W.\n\n\n(2)\nIf this were the case, then there must\nalso be a possible world, W*, in which a\nand b are \u201cswitched.\u201d\n\n\n(3)\nBut if this were the case, then God could\nhave had no reason for choosing W over\nW*.\n\n\n(4)\nBut God must have a reason for acting as\nhe does. (PSR)\n\n\n(5)\nTherefore, our original supposition must\nbe false.  There are not two indiscernible individuals in our\nworld. (PII)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, it was said above that Leibniz excludes purely extrinsic\ndenominations (or relational properties) from the kinds of properties\nthat are constitutive of an individual. To allow purely extrinsic\ndenominations would be to accept the possibility that that two things\ncould be discernible in terms of their relational properties while\nbeing identical in terms of their intrinsic properties, for their\nrelational properties would not follow from their intrinsic properties.\n(Again, if relational properties were allowed to factor into the nature\nof an individual, then PII would be relatively weak. Of course two\nthings that exist in different spatio-temporal locations are distinct,\nand that is what Leibniz admits in the passage from the New\nEssays above.) But if we follow Leibniz in excluding such\nrelational properties as difference-making properties and reflect on\nthe above argument, then we see that worlds are distinguished in terms\nof intrinsic properties of individuals and that this difference has a\nbearing on the relative greatness or perfection of a world. Again, let\na and b be\nindiscernible but occupying mirror positions in\nW and W*. How could\nwe ever say that W was more worthy of\nGod's choice than W*? We could not.\nThere must be a reason why a is here\nand b is there, and this reason has\nto do with the intrinsic properties of a and\nb. In other words, even the relational\nproperties must be somehow derivative of the intrinsic properties of\nsubstances.\n\n\nAs we shall see, Leibniz employs this principle in a range of\narguments: against the mind as a tabula rasa, against atomism,\nagainst Newtonian absolute space, and so on.
