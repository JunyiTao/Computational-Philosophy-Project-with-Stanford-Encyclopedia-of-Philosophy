    "main_text": "The Ethics of Public Goods: Should the Government Pay for Public Goods? || The Market As a Discovery Process\n6.2 The Market As a Discovery Process\n\nOne point that advocates of government provision of public goods often\noverlook is the information creation and coordinating function of the\nprice system (as described by Hayek 1945). In a market, prices\ngenerate information about preferences and scarcities. If a good is\nwanted by many individuals, it will become more scarce and its price\nwill rise. The increase in price does not only provide a reason for\nconsumers to buy less of it, it also signals to producers to make more\nand to potential market entrants that the market is lucrative. In the\nlong run, supply should therefore increase and the price fall again.\nThis mechanism does not operate when the government provides the\npublic good and finances it by taxation. If the government builds,\nsay, a lighthouse, it will be difficult to determine how much to\ninvest every year, whether and how to extend or alter the service\nprovided by the good (e.g., by building a second lighthouse nearby),\nand whether to invest in the development of new technologies.\n",
