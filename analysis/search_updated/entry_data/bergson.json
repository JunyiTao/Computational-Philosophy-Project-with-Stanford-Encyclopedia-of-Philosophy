    "preamble": "\n\nHenri Bergson (1859\u20131941) was one of the most famous and\ninfluential French philosophers of the late 19th century-early 20th\ncentury. Although his international fame reached cult-like heights\nduring his lifetime, his influence decreased notably after the second\nWorld War. While such French thinkers as Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and\nL\u00e9vinas explicitly acknowledged his influence on their thought,\nit is generally agreed that it was Gilles Deleuze\u2019s 1966\nBergsonism that marked the reawakening of interest in\nBergson\u2019s work. Deleuze realized that Bergson\u2019s most\nenduring contribution to philosophical thinking is his concept of\nmultiplicity. Bergson\u2019s concept of multiplicity attempts to\nunify in a consistent way two contradictory features: heterogeneity\nand continuity. Many philosophers today think that this concept of\nmultiplicity, despite its difficulty, is revolutionary. It is\nrevolutionary because it opens the way to a reconception of\ncommunity.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and works\n\nBergson was born in Paris on October 18, 1859; he was the second of\nseven children of a Polish Father and English mother; both of his\nparents were Jewish. Bergson was a notably exceptional pupil\nthroughout his childhood. Like his German contemporary, Edmund\nHusserl, Bergson\u2019s original training was in mathematics. Bergson\nwon the first prize in mathematics for the prestigious \u201cConcours\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\u201d which led to the publication of his\nsolution to a problem by Pascal in 1877. Bergson nevertheless chose to\nprepare for the \u00c9cole Normale in the letters and humanities\nsection. His math teacher, disappointed, famously claimed, \u201cyou\ncould have been a mathematician; you will be a mere philosopher\u201d\n(quoted in Soulez & Worms 2002, p. 35).\n\nIn 1878, Bergson became a French citizen, although he could have\nchosen English citizenship. He was accepted at the \u00c9cole\nNormale along with Jean Jaur\u00e8s and \u00c9mile Durkheim. He\ndiscovered Herbert Spencer with enthusiasm, and studied under\nF\u00e9lix Ravaisson and Jules Lachelier. Bergson graduated from the\n\u00c9cole Normale in 1881. He was the second best at the highly\nselective Agr\u00e9gation de Philosophie, thanks to a lecture\nentitled \u201cWhat is the value of contemporary psychology?\u201d\nHe began a teaching post in Angers at the high school (the\nlyc\u00e9e), and then moved to Clermont-Ferrand. There he taught\nboth at the Lyc\u00e9e and the University for the next five\nyears.\n\nHis first scholarly publication was in 1886, in the Revue\nPhilosophique; \u201cOn Unconscious Simulation in States of\nHypnosis\u201d concerns the results of his observations at sessions\nof hypnosis. Notice that Freud and Breuer\u2019s Studies on\nHysteria did not appear until 1896. This foreshadowed\nBergson\u2019s growing interest in the role of unconscious memories\nwithin recognition\u2014an interest that culminates in his being\nelected president of the London based Society for Psychical Research\nin 1913. In 1888, Bergson submitted two doctoral theses in Paris:\nEssai sur les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la conscience,\npublished as a book (Time and Free Will) in 1889; and the\nthen required Latin thesis, Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit\n(Aristotle\u2019s Conception of Place). In 1927, in a\nfootnote to Being and Time, Heidegger cited this second\nthesis, claiming that Bergson\u2019s view of time remains within the\nhorizon of Greek metaphysics.\n\nBergson\u2019s second book, Matter and Memory, appeared in\n1896. This book led to Bergson\u2019s election to the Coll\u00e8ge\nde France. In his second attempt, Bergson succeeded at obtaining a\npost, and teaches at the \u00c9cole Normale for two years starting\nin 1898 (Soulez et Worms, 2002, pp. 80\u201381). The Dreyfus Affair\nwas raging, but Bergson (a Jew by birth) refused to take part in the\npublic debate. Bergson published Laughter: an Essay on the Meaning\nof the Comic in 1900. He was appointed Chair of Ancient\nPhilosophy at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France. This marked\nthe beginning of his growing fame. In 1903, Bergson published, in the\nprestigious Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale, an article\nentitled \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics\u201d (later reproduced\nas the centerpiece of The Creative Mind [La Pens\u00e9e\net le mouvant] in 1934). The first of Bergson\u2019s works to be\ntranslated in many languages, this article not only became a crucial\nreading guide for Bergson\u2019s philosophy as a whole, but it also\nmarked the beginning of \u201cBergsonism\u201d and of its influence\non Cubism and literature. Through Williams James\u2019s enthusiastic\nreading of this essay, Bergsonism acquired a far-reaching influence on\nAmerican Pragmatism. Moreover, his imprint on American literature (in\nparticular, Wallace Stevens and Willa Cather, who created a character\ncalled \u201cAlexandra Bergson\u201d) is undeniable.\n\nCreative Evolution appeared in 1907 and was not only the\nsource of the \u201cBergson legend,\u201d as well as of numerous,\nlively academic and public controversies centering on his philosophy\nand his role as an intellectual. The beginning of the next decade is\nthe apex of the \u201cBergsonian cult\u201d (\u201cle Bergson\nboom\u201d). Creative Evolution was translated into English.\nBertrand Russell (who publishes an article entitled \u201cThe\nPhilosophy in Bergson\u201d in The Monist in 1912) objected\nthat Bergson wants to turn us into bees with the notion of intuition.\nRussell also noted that any attempt at classifying Bergson would fail,\nas his philosophy cuts across all divisions, whether empiricist,\nrealist or idealist (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 124). Bergson\u2019s\nlectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France were filled to capacity, not\nonly with society ladies and their suitors, but also with a whole\ngeneration of philosophy students (\u00c9tienne Gilson and Jean Wahl\namong others) and poets such as T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn January 1913, Bergson visited the United States for the first time\n(Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 134). The week before he delivered his first\nlecture at Columbia University (entitled \u201cSpirituality and\nLiberty\u201d), The New York Times published a long article on him.\nThe enthusiasm this article generated may explain the traffic jam that\noccurred before Bergson\u2019s lecture, the first traffic jam in the\nhistory of Broadway. In the same year, Bergson gave the Presidential\nAddress, entitled \u201cPhantasms of the Living and Psychical\nResearch,\u201d to the Society for Psychical Research in London,\nEngland. The next year Bergson was elected a member of the\nAcad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise; he was the first Jewish member in\nits history. He also presented courses at the Coll\u00e8ge de France\non Modern Philosophy and Spinoza. His international fame continued to\ngrow through the delivery of the Gifford Lecture at Edinburgh\nUniversity in Scotland in May and June; the lectures were called\n\u201cThe Problem of Personality.\u201d Finally, in the same year,\nthe Roman Catholic Church, in opposition to evolutionary theory,\ncondemned Bergson\u2019s philosophy.\n\nOf course, in the middle of this decade, war broke out, and Bergson\nentered his political career, which took him first to Spain in 1917\n(Soulez et Worms 2002, p.150). But more importantly, the French\ngovernment sent him to the United-States as a diplomatic emissary to\nmeet President Wilson (Soulez et Worms 2002, p. 154; see also Soulez\n1989). After his first visit to the United States in 1913, he had\nthought that peace would come only from Washington, D.C. (Soulez et\nWorms 2002, p. 139). After his visit to Washington, Bergson said,\n\u201cI have just lived unforgettable hours. Humanity appeared to me\ntransfigured. [\u2026] France was saved. It was the greatest joy of\nmy life.\u201d At this time, Bergson was also working with\nWilson\u2019s government to form a \u201cleague of nations,\u201d a\nbody that would include representatives of all nations and that would\naim at establishing and maintaining peace. The League of Nations\nremained in existence until 1946, when it was replaced by the United\nNations.\u00a0 Increasingly Bergson became more famous for his\npolitical actions than for his philosophy.\n\n1919 saw the publication of Bergson\u2019s Mind Energy, a\ncollection of essays concerned with metaphysical and psychological\nproblems. During the same year he retired from his teaching duties.\nHowever, in 1922, Bergson was appointed president of the International\nCommission for Intellectual Cooperation \u2014 the precursor to\nUNESCO. There, Bergson participated in a debate with Einstein, which,\naccording to Merleau-Ponty, seems to testify to a \u201ccrisis of\nreason.\u201d\u00a0 Bergson published his reflections on Einstein as\nDuration and Simultaneity (see M\u00e9langes,\n1972). There is some controversy surrounding this book. Bergson\nallowed the book to be reprinted up to the sixth edition in 1931.\nHowever \u00c9douard Le Roy claims in a letter from 1953 (well after\nBergson\u2019s death) that he often spoke with Bergson about\nrelativity. Le Roy says, \u201c[Bergson] added with insistence that\nthe defective state of his knowledge of mathematics did not allow him\nto follow the development of generalized relativity in the detail such\na development required. Consequently [Bergson] thought it wiser to let\nthe question drop. This is why he refused to let Duration and\nSimultaneity be reprinted\u201d (Avertissement pour la\nsepti\u00e8me edition, Dur\u00e9e et\nsimultan\u00e9it\u00e9, p. 5, [Lawlor translation]). However,\nin Bergson\u2019s will, he does not mention Duration and\nSimultaneity as a text not to be republished. Thus, the editors\nof the seventh edition in 1968 (Jean Wahl, Henri Gouhier, Jean Gutton,\nVladimir Jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch) saw fit to reprint this book. In\na letter from November 1924, after complaining that in general his\nwritings on relativity had been badly understood by the\n\u201crelativist physicists.\u201d Bergson clarifies that his\nwritings on relativity should not be seen as dismissive of relativity\ntheory. He says, \u201cFor my part, I think that the theory of\nrelativity represents a very great advance, not only from the\nviewpoint of physics, but also from the viewpoint of philosophy\u201d\n(Bergson, Correspondences, p. 1122 [Lawlor translation]). If\nDeleuze\u2019s interpretation is correct, the confrontation that\nDuration and Simultaneity develops is not one between Bergson\nand Einstein but a confrontation between Bergson\u2019s\ninterpretation of multiplicities and Riemann\u2019s interpretation of\nmultiplicity, Riemann\u2019s interpretation being, according to\nDeleuze, the basis of Einstein\u2019s theory (Deleuze, 1991, pp.\n39\u201340, and also see below, \u201cThe Concept of\nMultiplicity\u201d).\n\nDuring the second half of the Twenties, Bergson suffered from severe\narthritis, which eventually forced him to retire from public life. In\n1928, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Finally, in 1932,\nhe surprised everyone with the publication of his last major book,\nThe Two Sources of Morality and Religion, which gave rise to\nrenewed debates and misunderstandings about his philosophy and his\nreligious orientation. The final collection of his essays, The\nCreative Mind, appeared in 1934.\n\nBergson died on January 3, 1941 at the age of 81. World War II had of\ncourse already begun, and Germany, occupying France, had established\nthe Vichy government. There is a rumor that he had converted to\nCatholicism near the end of his life, but there is no document to\nsupport this rumor. In fact, in a letter to Emmanuel Mounier, Madame\nBergson quotes her husband saying \u201cI would have converted [to\nCatholicism], if I had not seen over many years the great wave of\nanti-semitism preparing itself to expand over the world.\u201d Madame\nBergson continues in the letter to say that her husband had resolved\nnot to be baptized (B\u00e9guin and Th\u00e9venaz 1941, pp.\n11\u201312; also Soulez and Worms, p. 277). Because of his fame, the\nVichy Government offered Bergson exemptions from anti-Semitic\nregulations, but he refused. It is also rumored that he contracted the\ncold that killed him while waiting in line to register as a Jew.\nApparently, in the same will which his wife mentions in the letter to\nMounier (B\u00e9guin and Th\u00e9venaz 1941, p. 12), Bergson had\ninstructed that all of his papers be destroyed. The story goes that\nhis wife obeyed this order, throwing all of her husband\u2019s papers\ninto the fireplace. There is a rumor that she destroyed a half-written\nmanuscript. The result of this destruction is that the Bergson\nArchives in Paris (stored at Librairie Jacques Doucet on the Place de\nPanth\u00e9on in Paris) contain only Bergson\u2019s personal\nlibrary. So, the situation is very different for Bergson than for many\nother important French and German philosophers of the 20th Century who\nhave massive archives (Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty). The\nlack of archival material is one reason why Bergson went out of favor\nduring the second half of the Twentieth Century. We shall return to\nthis problem of Bergson\u2019s temporary disappearance from the\nphilosophical scene.\n2. The concept of multiplicity\n\nThe concept of multiplicity has two fates in the Twentieth Century:\nBergsonism and phenomenology (Deleuze, 1991, pp. 115\u2013118). In\nphenomenology, the multiplicity of phenomena is always related to a\nunified consciousness. In Bergsonism, \u201cthe immediate data of\nconsciousness\u201d (les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la\nconscience) are a multiplicity. Here, two prepositions,\n\u201cto\u201d and \u201cof,\u201d indicate perhaps the most basic\ndifference between Bergsonism and phenomenology. Of course, this\nphrase is the title of Bergson\u2019s first work, Essai sur les\ndonn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la conscience. The standard\nEnglish title of this work is Time and Free Will: An Essay on the\nImmediate Data of Consciousness. It is the text that Sartre\nclaimed attracted him to philosophy.\n\nTime and Free Will has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for\nwhom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time. Bergson\nthinks that Kant has confused space and time in a mixture, with the\nresult that we must conceive human action as determined by natural\ncausality. Bergson offers a twofold response. On the one hand, in\norder to define consciousness and therefore freedom, Bergson proposes\nto differentiate between time and space, \u201cto un-mix\u201d them,\nwe might say. On the other hand, through the differentiation, he\ndefines the immediate data of consciousness as being temporal, in\nother words, as the duration (la dur\u00e9e). In the\nduration, there is no juxtaposition of events; therefore there is no\nmechanistic causality. It is in the duration that we can speak of the\nexperience of freedom.\n\nFor Bergson, we must understand the duration as a qualitative\nmultiplicity \u2014 as opposed to a quantitative multiplicity. As the\nname suggests, a quantitative multiplicity enumerates things or states\nof consciousness by means of externalizing one from another in a\nhomogeneous space. In contrast, a qualitative multiplicity consists in\na temporal heterogeneity, in which \u201cseveral conscious states are\norganized into a whole, permeate one another, [and] gradually gain a\nricher content\u201d (Time and Free Will, p. 122). Bergson\neven insists that the word \u2018several\u2019 is inappropriate to\nqualitative multiplicity because it suggests numbering. In Time\nand Free Will, Bergson provides examples of a quantitative\nmultiplicity; the example of a flock of sheep is perhaps the easiest\nto grasp (Time and Free Will, pp. 76\u201377). To constitute\na quantitative multiplicity, which is always done out of a practical\nor utilitarian interest, one ignores the content of the space the\nitems occupy, which results in the space being homogeneous. In the\ncase of the flock of sheep, one ignores the fact that the pasture in\nwhich they are feeding is beautiful and the fact that the sheep are\nnot strictly identical to one another. One focuses on what they have\nin common. What one is interested in is the total number of sheep, be\nit for meat or wool production. We are able to enumerate them because\neach sheep occupies a discernable location within the field, because\nthey are juxtaposed to one another. Of course, the enumeration of the\nsheep is represented by a symbol, a number. Similarly, a calendar or a\nclock is a homogeneous form of time.\n\nThe idea of qualitative multiplicities is difficult to understand,\nalthough it is the heart of Bergson\u2019s thinking. Normally, we\nwould think that if there is heterogeneity, there has to be\njuxtaposition. But, in qualitative multiplicities, there is\nheterogeneity and no juxtaposition. Qualitative multiplicities are\ntemporal; qualitative multiplicity defines the duration. As with\nquantitative multiplicities, Bergson gives us many examples. But\nperhaps, the most significant example is the feeling of sympathy\nbecause, in the 1903 \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d\nBergson defines intuition as sympathy. Here, in Time and Free\nWill, he calls it a moral feeling (Time and Free Will,\n18\u201319). Our experience of sympathy begins, according to Bergson,\nwith us putting ourselves in the place of others, in feeling their\npain. But, Bergson continues, if this were all, the feeling would\ninspire in us abhorrence of others, and we would want to avoid them,\nnot help them. But then, one realizes that, if one does not help this\npoor wretch, it is going to turn out that no one will come to my aide\nwhen I need help. There is a \u201cneed\u201d to help the suffering.\nFor Bergson, these first two phases are \u201cinferior forms of\npity.\u201d In contrast, true pity is not so much fearing pain as\ndesiring it. It is as if nature committed a great injustice and what\nwe want is not to be seen as complicitous with it. As Bergson says,\n\u201cThe essence of pity is thus a need for self-abasement\n[s\u2019humilier], an aspiration downward\u201d into pain.\nBut, this downward aspiration develops into an upward movement into\nthe feeling of being superior. One feels superior because one comes to\nrealize that one can do without certain sensuous goods. In the end\nhowever, one feels humility, humble since one no longer needs and\ndesires such sensuous goods. By denying ourselves of these goods, we,\nin a way, reestablish justice. Later in the 1932 Two Sources of\nMorality and Religion, Bergson shows that the feeling of sympathy\nin fact progresses to the point of love for all things. In any case,\nthe feeling of sympathy is \u201ca qualitative progress.\u201d It\nconsists in a \u201ctransition from repugnance to fear, from fear to\nsympathy, and from sympathy itself to humility.\u201d There is a\nheterogeneity of feelings here. The feelings are continuous with one\nanother; they interpenetrate one another, and there is even an\nopposition between inferior needs and superior humility. If we tried\nto juxtapose the feelings, that is, separate them spatially, the\nfeelings would have a different nature than when they interpenetrate.\nThere would be no progress from one to the other. They would be\nisolated psychic states. Therefore, for Bergson, a qualitative\nmultiplicity is heterogeneous (or differentiated), continuous (or\nunifying), oppositional (or dualistic) at the extremes, and, most\nimportantly, temporal or progressive (an irreversible flow). Bergson\nalso calls the last characteristic of temporal progress mobility; this\ncharacteristic truly distinguishes duration from space, which is an\n\u201cimmobile medium\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 180).\nFinally, because a qualitative multiplicity is heterogeneous and yet\ninterpenetrating, it is inexpressible. The continuous and\nheterogeneous multiplicity of consciousness is given immediately, that\nis, without the mediation of symbols (Bergson 1992, 162). For Bergson\n\u2014 and perhaps this is his greatest insight \u2014 freedom is\nmobility. Because Bergson connects duration with mobility, in the\nsecond half of the Twentieth Century (in Deleuze and Foucault, in\nparticular), the Bergsonian concept of qualitative multiplicity will\nbe dissociated from time and associated with space (Deleuze 1986).\n\nIn \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d Bergson gives us three\nimages to help us think about the duration and therefore qualitative\nmultiplicities (The Creative Mind, pp. 164\u201365). The\nfirst is that of two spools, with a tape running between them, one\nspool unwinding the tape, the other winding it up. (During his\ndiscussion of Bergson, Heidegger focuses on this image in his 1928\nThe Metaphysical Foundations of Logic.) Duration resembles\nthis image, according to Bergson, because, as we grow older, our\nfuture grows smaller and our past larger. The benefit of this image is\nthat it presents a continuity of experiences without juxtaposition.\nYet, there is a drawback: because a tape moves between the two spools,\nthe image presents the duration as being homogeneous, as if one could\nfold the tape back over its other parts, as if the tape were\nsuper-posable, implying that two moments in consciousness might be\nidentical. Yet, as Bergson says, \u201cno two moments are identical\nin a conscious being\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 164).\nDuration, for Bergson, is continuity of progress and heterogeneity;\nmoreover, thanks to this image, we can also see that duration implies\na conservation of the past. Indeed, for Bergson and this is the center\nof his truly novel idea of memory, memory conserves the past and this\nconservation does not imply that one experiences the same\n(re-cognition), but difference. One moment is added onto the old ones,\nand thus, when the next moment occurs, it is added onto all the other\nold ones plus the one that came immediately before. In comparison,\ntherefore to the past collection of moments, it cannot be the same as\nthe one immediately before, because the past is \u201clarger\u201d\nfor the current moment than it was for the previous moment. Although\nBergson does not say this, one might say that Tuesday is different\nfrom Monday because Monday only includes itself and Sunday, while\nTuesday includes itself, Monday, and Sunday. This first image,\ntherefore, implies that duration is memory: the prolongation of the\npast into the present. We shall return to the question of memory\nbelow.\n\nThe second image of qualitative multiplicity is the color spectrum. We\nsaw in the first image of the spools that there is constant difference\nor heterogeneity. The color spectrum helps us understand this, since a\ncolor spectrum has a multiplicity of different shades or nuances of\ncolor. Here we have heterogeneity, but there is a drawback to this\nimage as well. We lose the characteristic of continuity or unity since\nthe spectrum has colors juxtaposed. As Bergson says, \u201cpure\nduration excludes all idea of juxtaposition, reciprocal exteriority\nand extension\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 164).\n\nBergson\u2019s third image is an elastic band being stretched.\nBergson tells us first to contract the band to a mathematical point,\nwhich represents \u201cthe now\u201d of our experience. Then, draw\nit out to make a line growing progressively longer. He warns us not to\nfocus on the line but on the action which traces it. If we can focus\non the action of tracing, then we can see that the movement \u2014\nwhich is duration \u2014 is not only continuous and differentiating\nor heterogeneous, but also indivisible. We can always insert breaks\ninto the spatial line that represents the motion, but the motion\nitself is indivisible. For Bergson, there is always a priority of\nmovement over the things that move; the thing that moves is an\nabstraction from the movement. Now, the elastic band being stretched\nis a more exact image of duration. But, the image of the elastic is\nstill, according to Bergson, incomplete. Why ? Because, for him, no\nimage can represent duration. An image is immobile, while duration is\n\u201cpure mobility\u201d (The Creative Mind, p. 165).\nLater, in Creative Evolution, Bergson will criticize the new\nart of cinema for presenting immobile images of movement. As Deleuze\nwill show in his cinema books, however, Bergson does not recognize the\nnovelty of this artform. Cinema does provide moving images. In any\ncase, in \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d Bergson compares\nall three images: \u201cthe unrolling of our duration [the spool] in\ncertain aspects resembles the unity of a movement which progresses\n[the elastic], in others, a multiplicity of states spreading out [the\ncolor-spectrum].\u201d Now we can see that duration really consists\nin two characteristics:\u00a0 unity and multiplicity. This double\ncharacteristic brings us to Bergson\u2019s method of intuition.\n3. The method of intuition\n\nAs we already noted, Bergson\u2019s thought must be seen as an\nattempt to overcome Kant. In Bergson\u2019s eyes, Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy is scandalous, since it eliminates the possibility of\nabsolute knowledge and mires metaphysics in antinomies.\nBergson\u2019s own method of intuition is supposed to restore the\npossibility of absolute knowledge \u2013 here one should see a\nkinship between Bergsonian intuition and what Kant calls intellectual\nintuition \u2013 and metaphysics. To do this, intuition in\nBergson\u2019s sense must place us above the divisions of the\ndifferent schools of philosophy like rationalism and empiricism or\nidealism and realism. Philosophy, for Bergson, does not consist in\nchoosing between concepts and in taking sides (The Creative\nMind, p. 175\u201376). These antinomies of concepts and\npositions, according to him, result from the normal or habitual way\nour intelligence works. Here we find Bergson\u2019s connection to\nAmerican pragmatism. The normal way our intelligence works is guided\nby needs and thus the knowledge it gathers is not disinterested; it is\nrelative knowledge. And how it gathers knowledge is through what\nBergson calls \u201canalysis,\u201d that is, the dividing of things\naccording to perspectives taken. Comprehensive analytic knowledge then\nconsists in reconstruction or re-composition of a thing by means of\nsynthesizing the perspectives. This synthesis, while helping us\nsatisfy needs, never gives us the thing itself; it only gives us a\ngeneral concept of things. Thus, intuition reverses the normal working\nof intelligence, which is interested and analytic (synthesis being\nonly a development of analysis). In the fourth chapter to Matter\nand Memory, Bergson calls this reversal of habitual intelligence\n\u201cthe turn of experience\u201d where experience becomes\nconcerned with utility, where it becomes human experience (Matter and\nMemory, pp.184\u201385). This placement of oneself up above the turn\nis not easy; above all else, Bergson appreciates effort.\n\nIntuition therefore is a kind of experience, and indeed Bergson\nhimself calls his thought \u201cthe true empiricism\u201d (The\nCreative Mind, p. 175). What sort of experience? In the opening pages\nof \u201cIntroduction to Metaphysics,\u201d he calls intuition\nsympathy (The Creative Mind, p. 159). As we have seen from our\ndiscussion of multiplicity in Time and Free Will, sympathy\nconsists in putting ourselves in the place of others. Bergsonian\nintuition then consists in entering into the thing, rather than going\naround it from the outside. This \u201centering into,\u201d for\nBergson, gives us absolute knowledge. In a moment, we are going to\nhave to qualify this \u201cabsoluteness.\u201d In any case, for\nBergson, intuition is entering into ourselves \u2013 he says we seize\nourselves from within \u2013 but this self-sympathy develops\nheterogeneously into others. In other words, when one sympathizes with\noneself, one installs oneself within duration and then feels a\n\u201ccertain well defined tension, whose very determinateness seems\nlike a choice between an infinity of possible durations\u201d (The\nCreative Mind, p. 185). In order to help us understand intuition,\nwhich is always an intuition of duration, let us return to the color\nspectrum image. Bergson says that we should suppose that perhaps there\nis no other color than orange. Yet, if we could enter into orange,\nthat is, if we could sympathize with it, we would \u201csense\nourselves caught,\u201d as Bergson says, \u201cbetween red and\nyellow.\u201d This means that if we make an effort when we perceive\norange, we sense a variety of shades. If we make more of an effort, we\nsense that the darkest shade of orange is a different color, red,\nwhile the lightest is also a different color, yellow. Thus, we would\nhave a sense, beneath orange, of the whole color spectrum. So,\nlikewise, I may introspect and sympathize with my own duration; my\nduration may be the only one. But, if I make an effort, I sense in my\nduration a variety of shades. In other words, the intuition of\nduration puts me in contact with a whole continuity of durations,\nwhich I could, with effort, try to follow upwardly or downwardly,\nupward to spirit or downward to inert matter (The Creative\nMind, p. 187). Thus Bergsonian intuition is always an intuition\nof what is other. Here we see that Bergson has not only tried to break\nwith Kant, but also with Parmenides\u2019s philosophy of the\nsame.\n\nBefore, we leave this discussion, it is important to realize that\nintuition, understood as my self-sympathy, like the one color orange,\nis what Bergson calls a \u201ccomponent part\u201d (The Creative\nMind, pp. 170\u201372). Just as the color orange is a real part of\nthe color spectrum \u2014 the mathematical equation which defines the\nlight waves of orange, on the contrary, being not a component part,\nfor Bergson, but a \u201cpartial expression\u201d \u2013 my own\nduration is a real part of the duration itself. From this\npart, I can, as Bergson would say, \u201cdilate\u201d or\n\u201cenlarge\u201d and move into other durations. But this starting\npoint in a part implies \u2013 and Bergson himself never seems to\nrealize this\u2013 that intuition never gives us absolute knowledge\nof the whole of the duration, all the component parts of the\nduration. The whole is never given in an intuition; only a\ncontracted part is given. Nevertheless, this experience is an integral\none, in the sense of integrating an infinity of durations. And thus,\neven though we cannot know all durations, every single one that comes\ninto existence must be related, as a part, to the others. The\nduration is that to which everything is related and in this sense it\nis absolute.\n\nBecause intuition in Bergson is \u201cintegral experience\u201d\n(The Creative Mind, p. 200), it is made up of an indefinite\nseries of acts, which correspond to the degrees of duration. This\nseries of acts is why Bergson calls intuition a method. The first act\nis a kind of leap, and the idea of a leap is opposed to the idea of a\nre-constitution after analysis. One should make the effort to reverse\nthe habitual mode of intelligence and set oneself up immediately in\nthe duration. But then, second, one should make the effort to dilate\none\u2019s duration into a continuous heterogeneity. Third, one\nshould make the effort to differentiate (as with the color orange) the\nextremes of this heterogeneity. With the second and third steps, one\ncan see a similarity to Plato\u2019s idea of dialectic understood as\ncollection and division. The method resembles that of the good butcher\nwho knows how to cut at the articulations or the good tailor who knows\nhow to sew pieces of cloth together into clothes that fit. On the\nbasis of the division into extremes or into a duality, one can then\nconfront our everyday \u201cmixtures\u201d of the two extremes.\nWithin the mixture, one makes a division or \u201ccut\u201d into\ndifferences in kind: into matter and spirit, for instance. Then one\nshows how the duality is actually a monism, how the two extremes are\n\u201csewn\u201d together, through memory, in the continuous\nheterogeneity of duration. Indeed, for Bergson, intuition is memory;\nit is not perception.\n4. Perception and memory\n\nSince its publication in 1896, Matter and Memory has\nattracted considerable attention (see, for example, Deleuze 1956). In\nthe Preface that he wrote in 1910, Bergson says that Matter and\nMemory \u201cis frankly dualistic,\u201d since it\n\u201caffirms both the reality of matter and the reality of\nspirit\u201d (Matter and Memory, p. 9). However, he is quick to warn\nus that the aim of the book is really \u201cto overcome the\ntheoretical difficulties which have always beset dualism\u201d\n(ibid.). In the history of philosophy, these theoretical difficulties\nhave generally arisen from a view of external perception, which always\nseems to result in an opposition between representation and matter.\nThus, Bergson\u2019s theory of \u201cpure perception,\u201d laid\nout in the first chapter of Matter and Memory aims to show that\n\u2014 beyond both realism and idealism \u2014 our knowledge of\nthings, in its pure state, takes place within the things it\nrepresents.\n\nBut, in order to show this, Bergson starts with a hypothesis that all\nwe sense are images. Now we can see the basis of Bergson\u2019s use\nof images in his method of intuition. He is re-stating the problem of\nperception in terms of images because it seems to be an intermediate\nposition between realism and idealism (Matter and Memory, p. 26).\nBergson is employing the concept of image to dispel the false belief\n\u2014 central to realism and materialism \u2014 that matter is a\nthing that possesses a hidden power able to produce representations in\nus. There is no hidden power in matter; matter is only images.\nBergson, however, not only criticizes materialism (its theory of\nhidden powers), but also idealism insofar as idealism attempts to\nreduce matter to the representation we have of it. For Bergson, image\ndiffers from representation, but it does not differ in nature from\nrepresentation since Bergson\u2019s criticism of materialism consists\nin showing that matter does not differ in nature from representation.\nFor Bergson, the image is less than a thing but more than a\nrepresentation. The \u201cmore\u201d and the \u201cless\u201d\nindicates that representation differs from the image by degree. It\nalso indicates that perception is continuous with images of matter.\nThrough the hypothesis of the image, Bergson is re-attaching\nperception to the real.\n\nIn perception \u2014 Bergson demonstrates this point through his\ntheory of pure perception \u2014 the image of a material thing\nbecomes a representation. A representation is always in the image\nvirtually. We shall return to this concept of virtuality below. In any\ncase, in perception, there is a transition from the image as being in\nitself to its being for me. But, perception adds nothing new to the\nimage; in fact, it subtracts from it. Representation is a diminution\nof the image; the transition from image to pure perception is\n\u201cdiscernment in the etymological sense of the word,\u201d a\n\u201cslicing up\u201d or a \u201cselection\u201d (Matter and\nMemory, p. 38). According to Bergson, selection occurs because of\nnecessities or utility based in our bodies. In other words, conscious\nrepresentation results from the suppression of what has no interest\nfor bodily functions and the conservation only of what does interest\nbodily functions. The conscious perception of a living being therefore\nexhibits a \u201cnecessary poverty\u201d ( Matter and Memory, p.\n38).\n\nIf we can circle back for a moment, although Bergson shows that we\nperceive things in the things, the necessary poverty of perception\nmeans that it cannot define intuition. Turning back from the habitual\nuse of intelligence for needs, intuition, as we can see now, places us\nabove or below representations. Intuition is fundamentally\nun-representative. In this regard, the following passage from the\nthird chapter of Matter and Memory becomes very\nimportant:\n\nIf you abolish my consciousness \u2026 matter resolves itself into\nnumberless vibrations, all linked together in uninterrupted\ncontinuity, all bound up with each other, and traveling in every\ndirection like shivers. In short, try first to connect together the\ndiscontinuous objects of daily experience; then, resolve the\nmotionless continuity of these qualities into vibrations, which are\nmoving in place; finally, attach yourself to these movements, by\nfreeing yourself from the divisible space that underlies them in order\nto consider only their mobility \u2013 this undivided act that your\nconsciousness grasps in the movement that you yourself execute. You\nwill obtain a vision of matter that is perhaps fatiguing for your\nimagination, but pure and stripped of what the requirements of life\nmake you add to it in external perception. Reestablish now my\nconsciousness, and with it, the requirements of life: farther and\nfarther, and by crossing over each time enormous periods of the\ninternal history of things, quasi-instantaneous views are going to be\ntaken, views this time pictorial, of which the most vivid colors\ncondense an infinity of repetitions and elementary changes. In just\nthe same way the thousands of successive positions of a runner are\ncontracted into one sole symbolic attitude, which our eye perceives,\nwhich art reproduces, and which becomes for everyone the image of a\nman who runs (Matter and Memory, pp.208\u2013209).\n\n\nLike the descriptions of intuition, this passage describes how we can\nresolve the images of matter into mobile vibrations. In this way, we\novercome the inadequacy of all images of duration. We would have to\ncall the experience described here not a perception of matter, but a\nmemory of matter because of its richness. As we have already\nsuggested, Bergsonian intuition is memory. So, we turn now to\nmemory.\n\nAs we saw in the discussion of method above, Bergson always makes a\ndifferentiation within a mixture. Therefore, he sees that our word\n\u201cmemory\u201d mixes together two different kinds of memories.\nOn the one hand, there is habit-memory, which consists in obtaining\ncertain automatic behavior by means of repetition; in other words, it\ncoincides with the acquisition of sensori-motor mechanisms. On the\nother hand, there is true or \u201cpure\u201d memory; it is the\nsurvival of personal memories, a survival that, for Bergson, is\nunconscious. In other words, we have habit-memory actually aligned\nwith bodily perception. Pure memory is something else, and here we\nencounter Bergson\u2019s famous (or infamous) image of the memory\ncone.\n\nThe image of the inverted cone occurs twice in the third chapter of\nMatter and Memory (pp. 152 and 162). The image of the cone is\nconstructed with a plane and an inverted cone whose summit is inserted\ninto the plane. The plane, \u201cplane P,\u201d as Bergson calls it,\nis the \u201cplane of my actual representation of the\nuniverse.\u201d\u00a0 The cone \u201cSAB,\u201d of course, is\nsupposed to symbolize memory, specifically, the true memory or\nregressive memory. At the cone\u2019s base, \u201cAB,\u201d we have\nunconscious memories, the oldest surviving memories, which come\nforward spontaneously, for example, in dreams. As we descend, we have\nan indefinite number of different regions of the past ordered by their\ndistance or nearness to the present. The second cone image represents\nthese different regions with horizontal lines trisecting the cone. At\nthe summit of the cone, \u201cS,\u201d we have the image of my body\nwhich is concentrated into a point, into the present perception. The\nsummit is inserted into the plane and thus the image of my body\n\u201cparticipates in the plane\u201d of my actual representation of\nthe universe.\n\nThe inverted cone image is no exception to Bergson\u2019s belief that\nall images are inadequate to duration. The inverted cone is really\nsupposed to symbolize a dynamic process, mobility. Memories are\ndescending down the cone from the past to the present perception and\naction. The idea that memories are descending means that true memory\nin Bergson is progressive. This progressive movement of memory as a\nwhole takes place, according to Bergson, between the extremes of the\nbase of \u201cpure memory,\u201d which is immobile and which Bergson\ncalls \u201ccontemplation\u201d (Matter and Memory, p. 163), and the\nplane where action takes place. Whenever Bergson in any of his works\nmentions contemplation, he is thinking of Plotinus, on whom he\nlectured many times. But, in contrast to Plotinus, for Bergson,\nthinking is not mere contemplation; it is the entire or integral\nmovement of memory between contemplation and action. Thinking, for\nBergson, occurs when pure memory moves forward into singular images.\nThis forward movement occurs by means of two movements which the\ninverted cone symbolizes. On the one hand, the cone is supposed to\nrotate. Bergson compares the experience of true memory to a telescope,\nwhich allows us to understand the rotating movement. What we are\nsupposed to visualize with the cone is a telescope that we are\npointing up at the night sky. Thus, when I am trying to remember\nsomething, I at first see nothing all. What will help us understand\nthis image is the idea of my character. When I try to remember how my\ncharacter came about, at first, I might not remember anything; no\nimage might at first come to mind. Pure memory for Bergson precedes\nimages; it is unconscious. But, I try to focus, as if I were rotating\nthe rings that control the lenses in the \u201ctelescope\u201d; then\nsome singular images come into view. Rotation is really the key to\nBergson\u2019s concept of virtuality. Always, we start with something\nlike the Milky Way, a cloud of interpenetration; but then the cloud\nstarts to condense into singular drops, into singular stars. This\nmovement from interpenetration to fragmentation, from unity to\nmultiplicity, (and even from multiplicity to juxtaposition) is always\npotential or virtual. But the reverse process is also virtual.\nTherefore the cone has a second movement, \u201ccontraction\u201d\n(Matter and Memory, p. 168). If we remain with the telescope\nimage, we can see that the images of the constellation must be\nnarrowed, brought down the tube so that they will fit into my eye.\nHere we have a movement from singular images to generalities, on which\naction can be based. The movement of memory always results in action.\nBut also, for Bergson, this twofold movement of rotation and\ncontraction can be repeated in language. Even though Bergson never\ndevotes much reflection to language \u2013 we shall return to this\npoint below\u2013 he is well aware that literary creation resembles\nnatural creation. Here we should consult his early essay on laughter.\nBut, with this creative movement, which is memory, we can turn to\ncreative evolution.\n5. Creative evolution\n\nFor Bergson, the notion of life mixes together two opposite senses,\nwhich must be differentiated and then led into a genuine unity. On the\none hand, it is clear from Bergson\u2019s earlier works that life is\nthe absolute temporal movement informed by duration and retained in\nmemory. But, on the other hand, he has shown that life also consists\nin the practical necessities imposed on our body and accounting for\nour habitual mode of knowing in spatial terms. More specifically then,\nBergson\u2019s project in Creative Evolution is to offer a\nphilosophy capable of accounting both for the continuity of all living\nbeings\u2014as creatures\u2014and for the discontinuity implied in\nthe evolutionary quality of this creation. Bergson starts out by\nshowing that the only way in which the two senses of life may be\nreconciled (without being collapsed) is to examine real life, the real\nevolution of the species, that is, the phenomenon of change and its\nprofound causes. His argument consists of four main steps. First, he\nshows that there must be an original common impulse which explains the\ncreation of all living species; this is his famous vital impulse\n(\u00e9lan vital). Second, the diversity resulting from evolution\nmust be accounted for as well. If the original impulse is common to\nall life, then there must also be a principle of divergence and\ndifferentiation that explains evolution; this is Bergson\u2019s\ntendency theory. Third, the two main diverging tendencies that account\nfor evolution can ultimately be identified as instinct on the one hand\nand intelligence on the other. Human knowledge results from the form\nand the structure of intelligence. We learned from \u201cThe\nIntroduction to Metaphysics\u201d that intelligence consists\nprecisely in an analytic, external, hence essentially practical and\nspatialized approach to the world. Unlike instinct, human intelligence\nis therefore unable to attain to the essence of life in its duration.\nThe paradoxical situation of humanity (the only species that wants to\nknow life is also the only one that cannot do so) must therefore be\novercome. So, fourth, the effort of intuition is what allows us to place\nourselves back within the original creative impulse so as to overcome\nthe numerous obstacles that stand in the way of true knowledge (which\nare instantiated in the history of metaphysics). We are going to look\nat each of these four steps.\n\nFirst, we are going to look at the concept of vital impulse. In\nCreative Evolution, Bergson starts out by criticizing\nmechanism as it applies to the concepts of life and evolution. The\nmechanistic approach would preclude the possibility of any real change\nor creativity, as each development would be potentially contained in\nthe preceding ones. However, Bergson continues, the teleological\napproach of traditional finalism equally makes genuine creation of the\nnew impossible, since it entails, just as mechanism, that the\n\u201cwhole is given.\u201d Therefore, neither mechanism nor strict\nfinalism can give a satisfying account of the phenomenon of change\nthat characterizes life. Nevertheless, Bergson argues, there is a\ncertain form of finalism that would adequately account for the\ncreation of life while allowing for the diversity resulting from\ncreation. It is the idea of an original vital principle. If there is a\ntelos to life, then, it must be situated at the origin and not at the\nend (contra traditional finalism), and it must embrace the whole of\nlife in one single indivisible embrace (contra mechanism). But, this\nhypothesis does not yet account for evolution in the diversity of its\nproducts, nor does it explain the principle of the nature of life.\n\nSecond, we turn to Bergson\u2019s account of the\n\u201ccomplexification\u201d of life, that is, the phenomenon of its\nevolution from the simple original vital impulse into different\nspecies, individuals, and organs. The successive series of\nbifurcations and differentiations that life undergoes organize itself\ninto two great opposite tendencies, namely, instinct and intelligence.\nBergson arrives at this fundamental distinction by considering the\ndifferent modes through which creatures act in and know the external\nworld. Animals are distinguished from plants on the basis of their\nmobility, necessitated by their need to find food,whereas plants\nsurvive and grow through photosynthesis, which does not require\nlocomotion. While the relationship between consciousness and matter\ninstantiated in the instinct of animals is sufficient and well adapted\nto their survival (from the point of view of the species), humans are\nnot adequately equipped in this respect; hence the necessity of\nsomething like intelligence, defined by the ability to make tools.\nHumanity is essentially homo faber. Once again, from the\npoint of view of real, concrete life that Bergson is here embracing,\nintelligence is essentially defined by its pragmatic orientation (and\nnot speculation, as a dogmatic intellectualist approach would assume).\nFrom this, Bergson deduces not only the cognitive structure and the\nscientific history of intelligence (which he examines in detail), but\nalso its limitations. This essentially pragmatic, hence analytic and\nquantitative orientation of intelligence precludes its immediate\naccess to the essentially qualitative nature of life. Notice that the\ndistinction between the two tendencies relies on the original\ndistinction between the qualitative and the quantitative\nmultiplicities. In any case, in order that human intelligence may\nattain true knowledge of the essence of the vital impulse, it will\nhave to proceed by means of a mode of knowing that lies at the\nopposite end of intelligence, namely, instinct.\n\nThroughout Creative Evolution, Bergson\u2019s crucial point\nis that life must be equated with creation, as creativity alone can\nadequately account for both the continuity of life and the\ndiscontinuity of the products of evolution. But now the question is:\nif humans only possess analytic intelligence, then how are we ever to\nknow the essence of life? Bergson\u2019s answer \u2014 his third\nstep \u2014 is that, because at the periphery of intelligence a\nfringe of instinct survives, we are able fundamentally to rejoin the\nessence of life. For, as the tendency and the multiplicity theories\nmade clear, instinct and intelligence are not simply self-contained\nand mutually exclusive states. They must be called tendencies\nprecisely because they are both rooted in, hence inseparable from, the\nduration that informs all life, all change, all becoming. There is,\ntherefore, a little bit of instinct surviving within each intelligent\nbeing, making it immediately \u2014 if only partially \u2014\ncoincide with the original vital impulse. This partial coincidence, as\nwe described above, is what founds intuition.\n\nFinally, we can return to the question of intuition. Thanks to\nintuition, humanity can turn intelligence against itself so as to\nseize life itself. By a very different route than the one we saw\nbefore, Bergson shows, once again, that our habitual way of knowing,\nbased in needs, is the only obstacle to knowledge of the absolute.\nHere he argues that this obstacle consists in the idea of disorder.\nAll theories of knowledge have in one way or another attempted to\nexplain meaning and consistency by assuming the contingency of order.\nThe traditional question, \u201cwhy is there order rather than\ndisorder?\u201d necessarily assumes that the human mind is able to\ncreate order mysteriously out of chaos. But, for Bergson, the real\nquestion is: \u201corder is certainly contingent, but in relation to\nwhat\u201d (Creative Evolution, p. 232)? His answer consists in\nshowing that it is not a matter of order versus disorder, but rather\nof one order in relation to another. According to Bergson, it is the\nsame reasoning that underlies the ideas of chance (as opposed to\nnecessity), and of nothingness (as opposed to existence). In a word,\nthe real is essentially positive. The real obeys a certain kind of\norganization, namely, that of the qualitative multiplicity. Structured\naround its needs and interests, our intelligence fails to recognize\nthis ultimate reality.\n\nHowever, a fringe of intuition remains, dormant most of the time yet\ncapable of awakening when certain vital interests are at stake. The\nrole of the philosopher is to seize those rare and discontinuous\nintuitions in order to support them, then dilate them and connect them\nto one another. In this process, philosophy realizes that intuition\ncoincides with spirit, and eventually with life itself. Intuition and\nintelligence thus each correspond to tendencies within the human\npsyche, which, as whole, thereby coincides immediately\n\u2014 if only partially \u2014 with the vital impulse. It is only\nby leaping into intuition that the ultimate unity of mental life\nappears, for, just as Bergson showed against Zeno, that mobility\ncannot be reconstructed out of immobility. Here he explains that while\none can go from intuition to intelligence by way of diminution, the\nanalytic nature of intelligence precludes the opposite process. Thus\nBergson concludes, \u201cphilosophy introduces us into spiritual\nlife. And at the same time, it shows us the relation of the life of\nspirit to the life of the body\u201d (Creative Evolution, p. 268). In\na word, it is life in its creativity which unifies the simplicity of\nspirit with the diversity of matter. And it is a certain kind of\nphilosophy, insofar as it is able to place itself back within the\ncreative impulse, which is capable of realizing the necessary\n\u201ccomplementarity\u201d of the diverse, partial views\ninstantiated in the different branches of scientific knowledge and\nmetaphysical thought \u2014 so as to reestablish the absoluteness of\nknowledge, defined by its coincidence with absolute becoming.\n6. The two sources of morality and religion\n\nBergson himself says that his final book, The Two Sources of\nMorality and Religion, develops ideas from Creative\nEvolution. It attempts to show that there are two sources from\nwhich two kinds of morality and religion evolve. As always with\nBergson, Kant is at issue, in this case his moral philosophy. And as\nusual, Bergson starts by differentiating within a mixture. Under the\nword \u201cmorality\u201d or under the phrase \u201cmoral\nobligation,\u201d there is a mixture of two kinds of morality.\n\nThere is the closed morality, whose religion is static, and there is\nthe open morality, whose religion is dynamic. Closed morality and\nstatic religion are concerned with social cohesion. Nature has made\ncertain species evolve in such a way that the individuals in these\nspecies cannot exist on their own. They are fragile and require the\nsupport of a community. One quickly thinks of bees, and Bergson, of\ncourse, refers to them. We can see again that there are bodily needs\nwhich must be satisfied. The force of these needs is the source of the\nclosed morality. Because of these needs, there is a rigidity to the\nrules of closed moralities. Kant\u2019s moral philosophy has its\nsource in such needs. The survival of the community requires that\nthere be strict obedience: the categorical imperative. Yet, although\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative is supposed to be universal, it is\nnot, according to Bergson. It is limited and particular. Closed\nmorality really concerns the survival of a society, my society.\nTherefore, it always excludes other societies. Indeed, for Bergson,\nclosed morality is always concerned with war. And static religion, the\nreligion of closed morality, is based on what Bergson calls the\n\u201cfabulation function.\u201d The fabulation function is a\nparticular function of the imagination that creates \u201cvoluntary\nhallucinations.\u201d The fabulation function takes our sense that\nthere is a presence watching over us and invents images of gods. These\nimages then insure strict obedience to the closed morality. In short,\nthey insure social cohesion.\n\nBut, there is another kind of morality and religion, according to\nBergson. The open morality and dynamic religion are concerned with\ncreativity and progress. They are not concerned with social cohesion,\nand thus Bergson calls this morality \u201copen\u201d because it\nincludes everyone. The open morality is genuinely universal and it\naims at peace. It aims at an \u201copen society.\u201d The source of\nthe open morality is what Bergson calls \u201ccreative\nemotions.\u201d The difference between creative emotions and normal\nemotions consists in this: in normal emotions, we first have a\nrepresentation which causes the feeling (I see my friend and then I\nfeel happy); in creative emotion, we first have the emotion which then\ncreates representations. So, Bergson gives us the example of the joy\nof a musician who, on the basis of emotion, creates a symphony, and\nwho then produces representations of the music in the score. We can\nsee here that Bergson has also finally explained how the leap of an\nintuition happens. The creative emotion makes one unstable and throws\none out of the habitual mode of intelligence, which is directed at\nneeds. Indeed, in The Two Sources, Bergson compares creative\nemotions to unstable mental states as those found in the mad. But what\nhe really has in mind is mystical experience. For Bergson, however,\nmystical experience is not simply a disequilibrium. Genuine mystical\nexperience must result in action; it cannot remain simple\ncontemplation of God. This association of creative emotions with\nmystical experience means that, for Bergson, dynamic religion is\nmystical. Indeed, dynamic religion, because it is always creative,\ncannot be associated with any particular organized set of doctrines. A\nreligion with organized \u2013 and rigid \u2014 doctrines is always\nstatic.\n\nThe phrase with which we began, \u201cmoral obligation,\u201d makes\none think of Kantian duty. We have alluded to Kant on several\noccasions, but, let us conclude by examining Bergson\u2019s explicit\ncriticism of Kant\u2019s moral philosophy. This criticism will\ndemonstrate the strength of Bergson\u2019s moral philosophy and of\nhis thought as a whole. According to Bergson, Kant\u2019s theory has\nmade a \u201cpsychological error.\u201d In any given society, there\nare many different, particular obligations. The individual in society\nmay at some time desire to deviate from one particular obligation.\nWhen this illicit desire arises, there will be resistance from society\nbut also from his habits. If the individual resists these resistances,\na psychological state of tension or contraction occurs. The\nindividual, in other words, experiences the rigidity of the\nobligation. Now, according to Bergson, when philosophers such as Kant\nattribute a severe aspect to duty, they have externalized this\nexperience of obligation\u2019s inflexibility. In fact, for Bergson,\nif we ignore the multiplicity of particular obligations in any given\nsociety, and if instead we look at what he calls \u201cthe whole of\nobligation\u201d (The Two Sources, p. 25), then we see that\nobedience to obligation is almost natural. According to Bergson,\nobligations, that is, customs, arise because of the natural need an\nindividual has for the stability that a society can give. As a result\nof this natural need, society inculcates habits of obedience in the\nindividual. Habituation means that obedience to the whole of\nobligation is, in fact, for the individual, effortless.\n\nThe psychological error then consists in externalizing an exceptional\nexperience \u2013 which Bergson calls \u201cresistance to the\nresistances\u201d \u2013 into a moral theory. Duty becomes severe\nand inflexible. But there is more to this error. Kant believes that he\ncan resolve obligation into rational elements. In the experience of\nresistance to the resistances, the individual has an illicit desire.\nAnd, since the individual is intelligent, the individual uses\nintelligence, a rational method, to act on itself. According to\nBergson, what is happening here is that the rational method is merely\nrestoring the force of the original tendency to obey the whole of\nobligation that society has inculcated in the individual. But as\nBergson notes, the tendency is one thing; the rational method is\nanother. The success of the rational method, however, gives us the\nillusion that the force with which an individual obeys any particular\nobligation comes from reason, that is, from the idea or\nrepresentation, or better still, from the formula of the\nobligation.\n\nBut, there is another force. The second force is what Bergson calls\n\u201cthe impetus of love\u201d (The Two Sources, p. 96).\nThe impetus of love, like joy but also like sympathy, is a creative\nemotion. The emotion must be explicated into actions and\nrepresentations. But, this process of explication can be extended. The\nrepresentations that the mystic explicates can be further explicated\ninto formulas, for example, the formula of each person being deserving\nof respect and dignity. These formulas, which are the expression of\ncreation and love, are now able to be mixed with the formulas that aim\nsolely to insure the stability of any given society. Since we are now\nspeaking only of formulas, creation and cohesion, the two forces, are\nmixed together in reason. As before, whereas the rational method used\nin the experience of resistance to the resistances comes to explain\nthe force of obedience, here in the mystical experience of the impetus\nof love the formulas come to explain the force of creation. A reversal\nhas taken place. The very forces that have generated the formulas are\ninstead now being explained by those very formulas. Indeed, this is\nthe problem. How could some representation of intelligence have the\npower to train the will?\u00a0 How could an idea categorically demand\nits own realization?\u00a0 As Bergson says, \u201cRe-establish the\nduality [of forces], the difficulties vanish\u201d (The Two\nSources, p. 96). The two forces are, however, but two\ncomplementary manifestations of life.\n7. The revitalization of Bergsonism\n\nThere are numerous reasons for Bergson\u2019s disappearance from the\nphilosophical scene after World War II. First, at least in France, a\nnew generation of philosophers was arising, in particular, Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty. Like any new generation, this one had to differentiate\nitself from the tradition it was inheriting; in many respects,\nBergson\u2019s thought dominated this tradition. But more important\nwas the fact that Sartre and Merleau-Ponty became interested in\nHusserlian phenomenology, and then in Heidegger\u2019s thought. The\ninfluence of German philosophy on post-World War II French thought is\nwell known. It contributed to the eclipse of Bergson. But, there are\nsome aspects of Bergson\u2019s thought itself which contributed to\nthis eclipse. On the one hand, there is Bergson\u2019s constant\nsuspicion of language; for Bergson, as we noted in the discussion of\nintuition, language is equivalent to symbols. And, symbols divide the\ncontinuity of the duration, leading us into illusions. Bergson\u2019s\ncriticisms of language, moreover, must have struck the generation of\nFrench philosophers who came of age in the 1960s as strange.\nPhilosophers such as Derrida had so thoroughly embraced Heidegger that\nthey believed that \u201clanguage is the house of being.\u201d On\nthe other hand, there is the mysticism of The Two Sources.\nThe striking religious tone of this book did not harmonize well with\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology, which aimed to be a rigorous\nscience.\n\nYet, we can speak of a recent revitalization of Bergsonism.\u00a0 This\nrevitalization is due almost entirely to Deleuze. As we have come to\nunderstand Deleuze\u2019s own thought better, we can see the\noverwhelming influence of Bergson. In particular, two aspects of\nBergson\u2019s thought attracted Deleuze. We have already mentioned\none of them: the concept of multiplicity. This concept is at the very\nheart of Deleuze\u2019s thought, and duration is the model for all of\nDeleuze\u2019s \u201cbecomings.\u201d\u00a0 The other aspect that\nattracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is\nBergson\u2019s criticism of the concept of negation in Creative\nEvolution. We must recall that the linguistic turn in France\nduring the 1960s was accompanied by an \u201canti-Hegelianism.\u201d\nThus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the Hegelian\ndialectic, the negative. Moreover, at the end of his life,\nMerleau-Ponty was also coming to realize that Bergson\u2019s\ncriticism of negation is philosophically important; for Merleau-Ponty,\nthe criticism seemed to function like Husserl\u2019s\n\u201cphenomenological reduction,\u201d and perhaps re-opened what\nHeidegger would call the question of being. But, overall, we must see\nthat a revitalization of Bergsonism became possible because of\nDeleuze\u2019s insistence that Bergsonism is an alternative to the\ndomination of phenomenological thought, including that of Heidegger.\nThe revitalization of Bergsonism leads to a revitalization of the\nquestion of life itself, and not to the retrieval of the question of\nbeing.\n\nIf Deleuze indeed presents a penetrating criticism of Heidegger, it\nlies in the claim that being (Sein) is a unity and not a\nmultiplicity (and in this regard Deleuze\u2019s criticism of\nHeidegger resembles a great deal that of Derrida who always targets\nHeidegger\u2019s idea of gathering [Versammlung]). For\nDeleuze (and perhaps for Derrida as well), the lack of an idea of\nmultiplicity affects Heidegger\u2019s conception of a people. Even if\nthe people in Heidegger are still coming, they will have a proper name\nthat indicates their community will be unified and perhaps closed. In\ncontrast. the people to come in Deleuze (and the democracy to come in\nDerrida) remain in need of a name which indicates that this people is\na genuine multiplicity. Perhaps in these ideas of an always still to\nbe named coming community, we find the enduring influence of\nBergson\u2019s \u201copen society.\u201d The most recent moment of\nthe Bergson revitalization follows on the idea of a people. Andrea J.\nPitts and Mark William Westmoreland published a volume called:\nBeyond Bergson: Exploring Race, Gender, and Colonialism through\nthe Writings of Henri Bergson (SUNY 2019).\n\nApart from Deleuze, and more recently, Frederic Worms has led the way\ntoward Bergson\u2019s revitalization in France. Worms founded the\nSociete des amis de Bergson in 2006. In 2019, several members of the\nSociete des amis de Bergson founded the Global Bergson Research\nProject whose purpose lies in rediscovering Bergson\u2019s influence\nall over the globe.\n",
