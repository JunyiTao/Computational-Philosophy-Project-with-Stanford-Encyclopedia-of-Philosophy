Strictly speaking, trickle-down\neconomics is not a genuine school of economic thought, nor would\nHayek, Friedman, or Buchanan have accepted that description of their\nviews. They did argue that all would benefit from the prosperity\nbrought about through the free market, but this was not necessarily\nbecause the rich would benefit first. Hayek (1960 [2011]) argued that\nthere is a kind of trickle-down effect for the prices of goods and\nservices, where luxuries for the rich become commonalities for the\npoor because manufacturers figure out how to lower prices to broaden\nmarket penetration over time. And indeed, it is standard in mainstream\neconomics to hold that as businesses accumulate capital, they can\nafford to pay their workers more and so can bid workers away from\nother companies. That process often involves increasing wages, so more\ncapital in the hands of the rich can lead to higher wages for\nthe poor through fairly ordinary causal channels. All the same, many\nneoliberal officials promised gains for the poor that did not often\nmaterialize.\n",
