    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and Naturalness || Introducing Naturalness\n5.1 Introducing Naturalness\n\nThe idea that underlies naturalness is that the phenomena\ndescribed by some physical theory should not depend sensitively on\nspecific details of a more fundamental (currently unknown) theory to\nwhich it is an effective low-energy approximation. In what follows,\nthe motivation, significance, and implementation of this idea in the\nframework of quantum field theory are explained. For a more detailed\nintroduction aimed at physicists see Giudice (2008), for one aimed at\nphilosophers of physics see Williams (2015).\n\nModern physics regards our currently best theories of particle physics\ncollected in the Standard Model as effective field theories.\nEffective field theories are low-energy effective approximations to\nhypothesized more fundamental physical theories whose details are\ncurrently unknown. An effective field theory has an in-built limit to\nits range of applicability, determined by some energy scale\n\\(\\Lambda\\). When applied to phenomena associated with energies higher\nthan \\(\\Lambda\\) the effective field theory will not deliver correct\nresults. At this point, the more fundamental theory must be considered\nto which the effective field theory supposedly is a low-energy\napproximation. For the theories collected in the Standard Model, it is\nknown that they cannot possibly be empirically adequate beyond\nenergies around the Planck scale \\(\\Lambda_{\\textrm{Planck}}\\approx\n10^{19} \\,\\textrm{GeV}\\), where\u2014presently unknown\u2014quantum\ngravitational effects become relevant. However, the Standard Model may\nwell be empirically inadequate already at energy scales significantly\nbelow the Planck scale. For example, if there is some presently\nunknown particle with mass \\(M\\) smaller than the Planck scale\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\textrm{Planck}}\\) but beyond the range of current\naccelerator technology which interacts with particles described by the\nStandard Model, the cut-off scale \\(\\Lambda\\) where the Standard Model\nbecomes inadequate may well be \\(M\\) rather than\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\textrm{Planck}}\\).\n\nIn an effective field theory, any physical quantity \\(g_{\\Fphys}\\) can\nbe represented as the sum of a so-called bare quantity \\(g_0\\) and a\ncontribution \\(\\Delta g\\) from vacuum fluctuations corresponding to\nenergies up to the cut-off \\(\\Lambda\\):  \n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\ng_{\\Fphys} = g_0 + \\Delta g. \n\\label{natural}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\nThe bare quantity \\(g_0\\) can be regarded as a black box that sums up\neffects associated with energies beyond the cut-off scale \\(\\Lambda\\)\nwhere unknown effects must be taken into account. Viewing a theory as\nan effective field theory means viewing it as a self-contained\ndescription of phenomena up to the cut-off scale \\(\\Lambda\\). This\nperspective suggests that one may only consider an effective theory as\nnatural if the physical quantity \\(g_{\\Fphys}\\) can be of its\nactual order of magnitude without any need for a delicate cancellation\nbetween \\(g_0\\) and \\(\\Delta g\\) to many orders of magnitude. Since\nthe bare quantity \\(g_0\\) sums up information about physics beyond the\ncut-off scale \\(\\Lambda\\), such a delicate cancellation between\n\\(g_0\\) and \\(\\Delta g\\) would mean that the order of magnitude of the\nphysical quantity \\(g_{\\Fphys}\\) would be different if phenomena\nassociated with energies beyond the cut-off scale \\(\\Lambda\\) were\nslightly different.\n\nOne can characterize violations of naturalness as instances of\nfine-tuning in that, where naturalness is violated,\nlow-energy phenomena depend sensitively on the details of some unknown\nfundamental theory concerning phenomena at very high energies.\nPhysicists have developed ways of quantifying fine-tuning in this\nsense (Barbieri & Guidice 1988), critically discussed by Grinbaum\n(2012). It is controversial whether, to the degree that violations of\nnaturalness can be seen as instances of fine-tuning, they should be\nregarded as problematic. Wetterich (1984) suggests that any\nfine-tuning of bare parameters is unproblematic because those\nparameters depend on the chosen regularization scheme and have no\nindependent physical meaning. As highlighted by Rosaler and Harlander\n(2019), Wetterich\u2019s perspective depends on an understanding of\nquantum field theories as defined by entire trajectories\n\\(g^i(\\Lambda)\\) in parameter space.\n\nAn alternative criterion of naturalness\u2014sometimes dubbed\nabsolute naturalness (see Wells [2015] for an empirical\nmotivation)\u2014is that a theory is natural if and only if it can be\nformulated using dimensionless numbers that are all of order \\(1\\).\nMore permissive is \u2019t Hooft\u2019s technical\nnaturalness criterion (\u2019t Hooft 1980), according to which a\ntheory is natural if it can be formulated in terms of numbers that are\neither of order \\(1\\) or very small but such that, if they were\nexactly zero, the theory would have an additional symmetry. The\nmotivation for this prima facie arbitrary criterion is that it\nelegantly reproduces verdicts based on the above formulation of\nnaturalness according to which low-energy phenomena should not depend\nsensitively on the details of some more fundamental theory with\nrespect to high energies.\n",
