    "main_text": "The Big Five || Philosophical Relevance of the Big Five\n3.2 Philosophical Relevance of the Big Five\n\nOn the surface, the Big Five taxonomy might seem to be a very\npromising resource for philosophers working on the virtues, whether\nfrom within a virtue ethical framework or not. However, there are at\nleast four reasons to be cautious about the relevance of this taxonomy\nto philosophical discussions of moral character.\n\nFirst, moral character traits are strikingly absent from the Big Five,\neven at the facet level. Modesty and altruism are there, to be sure,\nbut what about justice or honesty or courage? Any taxonomy which\nleaves them out will not be of much use to moral philosophers.\n\nTo be fair, the psychologists Ashton and Lee have long argued that the\nBig Five list of traits is incomplete. They have added a sixth\npersonality dimension called \u201chonesty/humility\u201d, which has\nfour facets for sincerity, fairness, greed-avoidance, and modesty\n(Ashton and Lee 2001, 2005, 2020; Lee and Ashton 2004). And their\nHEXACO personality assessment instrument has become widely used among\npersonality psychologists. Relevant to the point at hand, this six\ntrait taxonomy does a much better job of capturing moral traits,\nalthough it too is incomplete (what about gratitude or courage?).\n\nSuppose further additions were made to get to a complete taxonomy. The\nsecond worry that arises is methodological. Measures of Big Five\ntraits are questionnaire measures. Unfortunately, the items used tend\nto have questionable relevance to the traditional moral virtues.\nConsider, for instance, the agreeableness facet of\n\u201caltruism\u201d, which researchers tend to characterize in a\nway that makes it sound quite close to the virtue of compassion (Costa\nand McCrae 1992: 18). Here are the questionnaire items for altruism\nfrom McCrae and Costa\u2019s NEO-PI-R (where \u201cR\u201d is for a\nreversed item) (Costa and McCrae 1992: 72):\n\nSome people think I\u2019m selfish and egotistical. (R)\nI try to be courteous to everyone I meet.\nSome people think of me as cold and calculating. (R)\nI generally try to be thoughtful and considerate.\nI\u2019m not known for my generosity. (R)\nMost people I know like me.\nI think of myself as a charitable person.\nI go out of my way to help others if I can.\n\n\nFour of the items are concerned with the impressions we make on others\nand how they think of us, rather than how we ourselves are. Arguably\ntwo of them are better connected to manners and politeness, and one to\nsocial liking, with not one item assessing altruistic motivation.\nIndeed, only the final item asks directly about helping behavior at\nall.\n\nNot to mention that questionnaires, even with better items for\nassessing the virtues, are considered by many philosophers to have\nlimited value. Among several weaknesses, they omit the role of\nsubconscious processes in influencing behavior, and could instead\nreflect a person\u2019s significantly misinformed understanding of\nher own character.\n\nThe third reason for philosophers to be cautious about adapting work\non the Big Five to the study of moral character is also\nmethodological. On at least one way of understanding the Big Five\ntaxonomy, it classifies people, not on the basis of whether they have\ntraits like extraversion or not, but rather on the basis of the\ndegree to which they have these traits. In other words, it\nassumes that everyone has the trait of extraversion, and the\nmain question is only to what extent a given individual comes out on\nthe extraversion scale. What goes for extraversion also applies to\nintroversion. Everyone has that trait too.\n\nIn fact, it is going to follow, at least on this particular way of\nunpacking the Big Five approach, that everyone has all the traits\nthere are, at least to some degree or other. If we extend the Big\nFive taxonomy to include all the moral character traits as well, then\neveryone will be virtuous to some degree. But that is not all.\nEveryone will also be vicious to some degree as well. This will be\ntrue, even with respect to opposing virtues and vices such as courage\nand cowardice.\n\nMany moral philosophers are likely going to be concerned about how\nhelpful such an approach will be to their own work on character. For\nthey typically accept the following assumption:\n\n(A1) A person\ncannot have the virtue of honesty and the opposing vice of dishonesty\nas part of her character at the same time.\n\n\nBut that assumption is rejected in this research. Furthermore, many\nphilosophers would also accept that:\n\n(A2)Virtues and\nvices are threshold concepts.\n\n\nWhat this means is that not everyone\u2019s character automatically\nqualifies as having a given virtue or vice. There are normative\nstandards that a character trait has to meet to be \u201cgood\nenough\u201d to count as a virtue or \u201cbad enough\u201d to\ncount as a vice. But again this assumption is violated by the Big Five\ntaxonomy, at least as understood above.\n\nAmongst philosophers, Aristotle for instance clearly endorses both of\nthese assumptions. Virtue is rare on his view, and most people fail to\nmeet the relevant requirements. Plus vice is diametrically opposed to\nvirtue. Virtue ethicists in the Aristotelian tradition would follow\nhim in accepting\n (A1)\n and\n (A2)\n (for further discussion of these assumptions, see Miller 2019a).\n\nNow this is not at all to criticize this particular version of the Big\nFive approach. Given what it aims to do in personality psychology, it\nhas clearly been a very rich and important approach. The only point\nhere is that it may be ill-suited for incorporation into philosophical\ndiscussions of character.\n\nThere is a fourth and final reason why this might be true. Many\nphilosophers, especially those working in the Aristotelian tradition,\nunderstand character traits to be metaphysically real dispositions\nwith causal powers of their own that give rise to relevant thoughts\nand, in turn, to trait relevant actions. The trait of honesty, for\nexample, is a real feature of an honest person\u2019s psychology\nwhich, when triggered, can lead to the formation of honest occurrent\nthoughts and feelings. It can figure into causal explanations for\naction, and can be a reliable basis for predicting future\nbehavior.\n\nUp to this point, the metaphysical status of traits on the Big Five\napproach has not been specified. It turns out that there is some\ndisagreement about this amongst personality psychologists, but the\nclear majority position seems to be that they do not have any\nmetaphysical existence. The leading Big Five psychologists Oliver\nJohn, Richard Robins, Lewis Goldberg, Gerard Saucier, Robert Hogan,\nJerry Wiggins, Paul Trapnell, Laura Naumann, and Christopher Soto all\nseem to hold this view (John and Robins 1994: 138\u2013139; Goldberg\nand Saucier 1995: 221; Saucier and Goldberg 1996b: 24\u201325, 34,\n43; Hogan 1991, 1996; Wiggins and Trapnell 1996; John et al. 2008:\n140). McCrae and Costa seems to be two of the rare exceptions in\nholding a causal view of Big Five traits (McCrae and Costa 2003,\n2008).\n\nIf Big Five traits are not real entities with causal powers, then what\nare they? The standard view is that they are just descriptive labels\nfor how people tend to be. Put differently, they are useful\ndevices\u2014terms of classification\u2014which are far more\neconomical to use than is appealing to the thousands of trait terms in\nthe English language. Grouping people into only five categories is\nthus highly efficient (Hogan 1996: 170\u2013173; McCrae and Costa\n2003: 36), but it is a further step to say that there actually\nis a trait of extraversion which causally explains individual\ndifferences between people. As Daniel Ozer and Steven Reise note, the\nBig Five taxonomy,\n\n\nprovides a useful taxonomy, a hierarchical coordinate system, for\nmapping personality variables. The model is not a theory; it organizes\nphenomena to be explained by theory (1994: 360\u2013361).\n\n\nIn particular, it does not specify what the actual psychological\nprocesses are which lead people to act the way that they do.\n\nBut again, all of this is much less interesting to the moral\nphilosopher than it is to the personality psychologist. The moral\nphilosopher working on character typically wants to know about the\npsychological processes involved in virtue and vice, as well as\nwhether most people do or do not have such traits understood as causal\ndispositions. The Big Five approach won\u2019t be of much help in\nfurthering that kind of work.\n",
