A Democratic Conception of Legitimate Political Authority\n\n\nThe basic idea behind the democratic conception of legitimate\nauthority is that when there are disagreements among persons about how\nto structure their shared world together and it is important to\nstructure that world together, the way to choose the shared aspects of\nsociety is by means of a decision making process that is fair to the\ninterests and opinions of each of the members. When there is\ndisagreement about how to organize the shared system of law, property,\npublic education and the provision of public goods, no one can have his\nway entirely in this context without someone else not getting her way.\nEach person thinks that the ideas about justice and the common good\nwith which the others wish to organize their shared world are mistaken\nin some way. Yet there is a need for collective action. The only way to\ndo this that is reasonably fair to all the members is to make the\ndecision democratically.\n\n\nThe thought is that when an outcome is democratically chosen and\nsome people disagree with the outcome, as some inevitably will, they\nstill have a duty to go along with the decision because otherwise they\nwould be treating the others unfairly. If they refuse to go along and\ndisrupt the democratically chosen arrangements, they are assuming for\nthemselves a right to determine how things should go that overrides the\nequal rights of all the others. They are, in Peter Singer's words,\nassuming the positions of dictators in relation to the others. For if\nthey turned out to be in the majority, they would demand the compliance\nof the others.\n\n\nThe idea of fairness that underpins the democratic process is\ngrounded in different ways in different theories. The basic idea of\nequality is shared by most democratic theorists. Some argue that there\nis a fundamental duty of equal respect for the opinions of others that\ngrounds democratic decision making in the context of pervasive\ndisagreement (Singer 1974; Waldron 1999). Others wish to ground this\nduty of respect for the opinions of others in a deeper principle of\nequal concern for the interests of each member of society (Christiano\n1996).\n\n\nOn this kind of view the democratic assembly has a right to rule and\nto the obedience of its members. This right of the democratic assembly\nis grounded in the right of each member of the assembly to be accorded\nequal respect. The duty of equal respect requires that the collective\ndecision process gives each a vote in a broadly majoritarian process\nand a robustly equal opportunity to participate in the deliberations\nand negotiations leading to decisions. The equal rights of each of the\nmembers are in effect pooled in the democratic assembly so that because\none owes each person equal respect, and the democratic way of making\ndecisions embodies this equal respect, one owes the democratic assembly\nrespect.\n\n\nThe democratic assembly can be understood as the assembly of all\nadult citizens or better as the assembly of all the democratically\nchosen representatives of citizens. A conception of a democratic\nassembly requires, on this view, an account of the appropriate form of\ndemocratic representation (Christiano 1996). In addition, the\ndemocratic assembly is only one part of the complete system of\ngovernment. It is concerned with legislation only. In addition to this\na government requires executive and judicial functions whose legitimacy\nmay depend in part on other factors better grasped by the\ninstrumentalist view.\n\n\nThe duties that are owed the democratic assembly are content\nindependent and preemptive duties. They are content independent duties\nbecause each member has the duty, with a class of exceptions we will\nreview in a moment, just because the assembly has made a decision. The\nduties are preemptive because the citizen must put aside the\nconsiderations she initially planned on acting on in order to treat the\nrest of her fellow citizens with proper respect. The idea of equal\nrespect requires, on this account, deference to the decision of the\nmajority and not acting on one's own judgment when the majority\ndisagrees. So the decision of the majority gives a reason to obey that\npreempts or replaces the considerations one might act on were there no\nmajority decision.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this conception of authority is what was\ndescribed as a special conception above. The fact that democratic\nassemblies have authority does not imply that all other forms of\nregime never have authority. One might go along with a regime on the\nbasis of the instrumentalist conception of authority or even the\nconsent approach even if it is not democratic. It is clear\nnevertheless that democratic assemblies have a special kind of\nauthority.\n",
