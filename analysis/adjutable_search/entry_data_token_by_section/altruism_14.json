    "main_text": "Why care about others? || Eudaimonism\n4.1 Eudaimonism\n\nThe term \u201ceudaimonism\u201d is often used by philosophers to\nrefer to the ethical orientation of all or the major philosophers of\nGreek and Roman antiquity. \u201cEudaimonia\u201d is the\nordinary Greek word they apply to the highest good. As Aristotle\nobserves at the beginning of the Nicomachean Ethics, whenever\nwe act, we aim at some good\u2014but goods are not all at the same\nlevel. Lower goods are undertaken for the sake of more valuable goals,\nwhich are in turn pursued in order to achieve still better goods. This\nhierarchy of value cannot continue endlessly\u2014a life must have\nsome ultimate goal, something that is valuable in itself and not for\nthe sake of anything still better. What that goal should be, Aristotle\nacknowledges, is a much disputed matter; but at any rate, everyone\nuses the word \u201ceudaimonia\u201d to designate that\nhighest good. (\u201cHappiness\u201d is the standard translation,\nbut \u201cwell-being\u201d and \u201cflourishing\u201d may be\ncloser to the Greek word\u2019s meaning.)\n\nAristotle does not say that one\u2019s ultimate goal should be\none\u2019s own well-being (eudaimonia) and no one\nelse\u2019s. On the contrary, he holds that the common\ngood (the good of the whole political community) is superior to the\ngood of a single individual. Nonetheless, it has become common among\nscholars of ancient ethics to attribute to Aristotle and the other\nmajor moral philosophers of antiquity the assumption that one\u2019s\nultimate goal should just be one\u2019s own well-being.\n\nIs this an implausible assumption? That is the accusation of many\nsystems of modern moral philosophy, but one must be careful not to\nattribute to Greek and Roman ethics an extreme endorsement of\nselfishness. One way to see that this would be unfair is to recognize\nhow important it is to Aristotle that we love others for their\nsake. That is a key ingredient of his lengthy discussion of\nfriendship and love in Books VIII and IX of the Nicomachean\nEthics. There he argues that (i) friendship is an ingredient of a\ngood life, and (ii) to be a friend to someone (or at any rate a friend\nof the best sort) one must not treat him as a mere means to\none\u2019s own advantage or one\u2019s own pleasure. He elaborates\non (ii) by adding that in friendships of the best sort, each\nindividual admires the other for the excellence of that other\nperson\u2019s character, and benefits him for that reason. It is\nclear, then, that he explicitly condemns those who treat others as\nmere means to their own ends. So, even if it is true that, according\nto Aristotle, one\u2019s ultimate goal should be one\u2019s own\nwell-being (and no one else\u2019s), he combines this with the denial\nthat the good of others should be valued solely as a means to\none\u2019s own.\n\nIt is crucial, at this point, that we keep in mind the distinction,\ndrawn above in\n section 1.4,\n between (i) what constitutes well-being and (ii) what is a necessary\nmeans towards or a pre-condition of well-being. Aristotle argues that\none\u2019s well-being is constituted by the excellent use of\none\u2019s reason, and that such virtues as justice, courage, and\ngenerosity are among the qualities in which one\u2019s good consists.\nWhen one acts with justice and generosity towards one\u2019s family,\nor friends, or the larger community, that is good for oneself (one is\nachieving one\u2019s ultimate goal) and it is also good for\nothers\u2014in fact, one\u2019s action is motivated in part by the\ndesire to benefit those others for their sake. If treating\nothers justly and in accordance with the other ethical virtues were\nmerely a means towards one\u2019s own well-being, Aristotle\u2019s\nframework for ethics would be objectionably self-regarding\u2014and\nit would be difficult for it to endorse, without inconsistency, the\nthesis that we ought to benefit others for their sake.\n\nWe should recall a point made in\n section 1.1:\n altruistic acts need not involve self-sacrifice, and they remain\naltruistic even when they are performed from a mixture of motives,\nsome of which are self-interested. For Aristotle, altruism should\nalways be accompanied by self-interested motives. His system\nof practical thought could be dismissed out of hand if one begins with\nthe assumption that moral motivation must be purely altruistic, free\nfrom all taint of self-regard. Otherwise, it would not count as\nmoral. That idea has some currency, and it is often\nattributed (rightly or wrongly) to Kant. But on reflection, it is open\nto question. If it is the case that whenever one has a good reason to\nbenefit someone else for that person\u2019s sake, there is also a\nsecond good reason as well\u2014namely, that in doing so one will\nalso benefit oneself\u2014it would be implausible to suppose that one\nshould not let that second reason have any influence on one\u2019s\nmotivation.\n\nNonetheless, if another point made earlier is correct, there\nis a serious problem for Aristotle\u2019s eudaimonism. In\n section 1.2,\n we noted that someone is open to criticism if he is always guided by\nthe principle, \u201cI shall never do anything unless doing so is\nbest for me\u201d. Such a person seems insufficiently altruistic,\ninsufficiently willing to make compromises for the good of others. He\nis (to use the term introduced earlier) never altruistic in the strong\nsense. Aristotle, it might be said, would have been on firmer ground\nif he had said that ultimately one should act for one\u2019s own good\nand that of others. (To be fair to him, he does not deny\nthis; on the other hand, he does say that treating others well never\nmakes one worse off.)\n\nIf the project undertaken by Greek and Roman moral philosophy is to\nbegin with the unquestioned assumption that one should never act\ncontrary to one\u2019s own good, and that one\u2019s ultimate end\nshould be only one\u2019s own eudaimonia, it faces the serious\nobjection that it will never be able, on this basis, to give proper\nrecognition to the interests of others. The idea underlying this\nobjection is that we should be directly concerned with\nothers: the fact that an act one performs benefits someone\nelse can already provide a reason for undertaking it, without\nhaving to be accompanied by a self-interested reason. There\nis no argument to be found in ancient ethics \u2013none is\noffered\u2014that purports to show that the only way to justify\nhaving other-regarding motives is by appealing to the good it does\noneself to have them.\n\nAt the same time, that gives us no reason to dismiss out of hand the\nefforts made by these authors to show that in fact one does benefit by\nhaving altruistic motives. There is nothing morally offensive about\nasking the question: \u201cis it good for someone to be a good\nperson?\u201d once it is understood that being a good person might be\na component of well-being, not a means to further private\nends. As noted earlier\n (section 1.4),\n certain kinds of excellence are widely assumed to be components of a\ngood life. The examples used there were excellence in the arts, the\nsciences, and sport. But excelling at ethical life is also a plausible\nexample, since it consists in developing and exercising cognitive,\nemotional, and social skills that we are pleased and proud to have. In\nany case, it would be sheer dogmatism to close our minds and refuse to\nlisten to the arguments found in Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics that\nethical virtue is of great value because it is a component (and for\nthe Stoics the sole component) of one\u2019s well-being.\n",
