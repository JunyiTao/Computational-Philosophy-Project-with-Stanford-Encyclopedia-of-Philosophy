    "main_text": "Counterfactuals and Philosophy || Semantic Puzzles\n1.4 Semantic Puzzles\n\nIt should now be clear that a wide variety of central philosophical\ntopics rely crucially on counterfactuals. This highlights the need to\nunderstand their semantics: how can we systematically specify what the\nworld must be like if a given counterfactual is true and capture\npatterns of valid inference involving them? It turns out to be rather\ndifficult to answer this question using the tools of classical logic,\nor even modal logic. This section will explain why.\n\nLogical semantics (Frege 1893; Tarski 1936;\nCarnap 1948) provided many useful analyses of English\nconnectives like and and not using Boolean\ntruth-functional connectives like \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\neg\\).\nUnfortunately, such an analysis is not possible for counterfactuals.\nIn truth-functional semantics, the truth of a complex sentence is\ndetermined by the truth of its parts because a connective\u2019s\nmeaning is modeled as a truth-function\u2014a function from one or\nmore truth-values to another. Many counterfactuals have false\nantecedents and consequents, but some are true and others false.\n (17a)\n is false\u2014given Joplin\u2019s critiques of\nconsumerism\u2014and\n (17b)\n is true.\n\n(17)\na.If Janis Joplin were alive today,\nshe would drive a Mercedes-Benz.\nb.If Janis Joplin were alive today, she\nwould metabolize food.\n\nIt may be useful to state the issue a bit more precisely.\n\nIn truth-functional semantics, the truth-value (True/False: 1/0) of a\ncomplex sentence is determined by the truth-values of its parts and\nparticular truth-function expressed by the connective. This is\nillustrated by the truth-tables for negation \\(\\neg\\), conjunction\n\\(\\land\\), and the material conditional \\(\\supset\\) in\n Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\phi\\)\n\\(\\neg\\phi\\) \n\n1\n0 \n\n0\n1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\phi\\)\n\\(\\psi\\)\n\\(\\phi\\land\\psi\\) \n\n1\n1\n1 \n\n1\n0\n0 \n\n0\n1\n0 \n\n0\n0\n0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\phi\\)\n\\(\\psi\\)\n\\(\\phi\\supset\\psi\\) \n\n1\n1\n1 \n\n1\n0\n0 \n\n0\n1\n1 \n\n0\n0\n1 \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Negation (\\(\\neg\\)),\nConjunction (\\(\\land\\)), Material Conditional (\\(\\supset\\))\n\n\nTruth-functional logic is inadequate for counterfactuals not just\nbecause the material conditional \\(\\supset\\) does not capture the fact\nthat some counterfactuals with false antecedents like\n (17a)\n are false. It is inadequate because there is, by definition, no\ntruth-functional connective whatsoever that simultaneously combines\ntwo false sentences to make a true one like\n (17b)\n and combines two false ones to make a false one like\n (17a).\n In contemporary philosophy, this is overwhelmingly seen as a failing\nof classical logic. But there was a time at which it fueled skepticism\nabout whether counterfactuals really make true or false claims about\nthe world at all. Quine (1960: \u00a746, 1982:\nCh.3) voices this skepticism and supports it by highlighting\npuzzling pairs like\n (18)\n and\n (19):\n \n\n(18)\n\n\na.\nIf Caesar had been in charge [in Korea], he would have used the atom bomb.\nb.\nIf Caesar had been in charge [in Korea], he would have used catapults.\n\n\n\n\n(19)\n\n\na.\nIf Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, Bizet would have been Italian.\nb.\nIf Bizet and Verdi had been compatriots, Verdi would have been French.\n\n\n\n\nQuine (1982: Ch.3) suggests that no\nstate of the world could settle whether\n (19a)\n or\n (19b)\n is true. Similarly he contends that it is not the world, but\nsympathetically discerning the speaker\u2019s imagination and purpose\nin speaking that matters for the truth of\n (18b)\n versus\n (18a)\n(Quine 1960: \u00a746). Rather than\npromoting skepticism about a semantic analysis of counterfactuals,\nLewis (1973b: 67) took these examples as\nevidence that their truth-conditions are\ncontext-sensitive: the possibilities that are\nconsidered when evaluating the antecedent are constrained by the\ncontext in which the counterfactual is asserted, including the\nintentions and practical ends of the speaker. All contemporary\naccounts of counterfactuals incorporate some version of this\n idea.[17]\n\nPerhaps the most influential semantic puzzle about counterfactuals was\nhighlighted by Goodman (1947), who\nnoticed that adding more information to the antecedent can actually\nturn a true counterfactual into a false one. For example,\n (20a)\n could be true, while\n (20b)\n is false.\n\n(20)\n\n\na.\nIf I had struck this match, it would have lit.\n\n\\(\\mathsf{S > L}\\)\n\nb.\nIf I had struck this match and done so in a room without oxygen, it would have lit.\n\n\\(\\mathsf{(S\\land \\neg O)> L}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis (1973c: 419; 1973b: 10) dramatized\nthe problem by considering sequences such as\n (21),\n where adding more information to the antecedent repeatedly flips the\ntruth-value of the counterfactual. \n\n(21)\n\n\na.\nIf I had shirked my duty, no harm would have ensued.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{I > \\neg H}\\)\nb.\nThough, if I had shirked my duty and you had too, harm would\n\thave ensued.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{(I \\land U)> H}\\)\nc.\nYet, if I had shirked my duty, you had shirked your duty and\n\ta third person done more than their duty, then no harm would have\n\tensued.\n\t\\(\\mathsf{(I\\land U\\land T) > \\neg H}\\)\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nThe English discourse\n (21)\n is clearly consistent: it is nothing like saying I shirked my\nduty and I did not shirk my duty. This property of\ncounterfactual antecedents is known by a technical name,\nnon-monotonicity, and is one of the features all contemporary\naccounts are designed to capture. As will be discussed in\n \u00a72.2,\n even modal logic does not have the resources to capture semantically\nnon-monotonic operators.\n\nGoodman (1947) posed another influential\nproblem. Examples\n (20a)\n and\n (20b)\n show that the truth-conditions of counterfactuals depend on assumed\nbackground facts like the presence of oxygen. However, a\nmoment\u2019s reflection reveals that specifying all of these\nbackground facts is quite difficult. The match must be dry, oxygen\nmust be present, wind must be below a certain threshold, the friction\nbetween the striking surface and the match must be sufficient to\nproduce heat, that heat must be sufficient to activate the chemical\nenergy stored in the match head, etc. Further, counterfactuals like\n (20a)\n also rely for their truth on physical laws specific to our world,\ne.g., the conservation of energy. Goodman\u2019s problem is this: it\nis difficult to adequately specify these background conditions and\nlaws without further appealing to counterfactuals. This is clearest\nfor laws. As discussed in\n \u00a71.3,\n some have aimed to distinguish laws from accidental generalizations\nby noting that only the former support counterfactuals. But if this is\na defining feature of laws, and laws are part of the definition of\nwhen a counterfactual is true, circularity becomes a concern. Explicit\nanalyses of laws in terms of counterfactuals, like Lange\n(2009), would make an analysis of\ncounterfactuals in terms of laws circular.\n\nThe potential circularity for background conditions takes a bit more\nexplanation. Suppose one claims to have specified all of the\nbackground conditions relevant to the truth of\n (20a),\n as in\n (22a).\n Then it is tempting to say that\n (20a)\n is true because\n (22c)\n follows from\n (22a),\n (22c), and the physical laws. \n\n(22)\n\n\na.\nThe match was dry, oxygen was present, wind was below a\n\tcertain threshold, the potential friction between the striking\n\tsurface and the match was sufficient to produce heat, that\n\theat was sufficient to activate the chemical energy stored in\n\tthe match head \u2026\nb.\nThe match was struck.\nc.\nThe match lit.\n\n\n\n\nBut now suppose there is an agent seeing to it that a fire is not\nstarted, and will only strike the match if it is wet. In this case the\ncounterfactual\n (20a)\n is intuitively false. However, unless one adds the counterfactual,\nif the match were struck, it would have to be wet, to the\nbackground conditions,\n (22c)\n still follows from\n (22a),\n (22c), and the physical laws. That would incorrectly predict\nthe counterfactual to be true. In short, it seems that the background\nconditions must themselves consist of counterfactuals. Any analysis of\ncounterfactuals that captures their sensitivity to background facts\nmust either eliminate these appeals to counterfactuals, or show how\nthis appeal is non-circular, e.g., part of a recursive, non-reductive\nanalysis.\n\nTo summarize, this section has identified three key theses about the\nsemantics of counterfactuals and a central problem:\n\nKey Semantic Theses about Counterfactuals\n\nCounterfactuals are not\ntruth-functional.\nCounterfactuals have context-sensitive\ntruth-conditions.\nCounterfactual antecedents are interpreted\nnon-monotonically.\n \n\n\nGoodman\u2019s Problem\u00a0\u00a0 The\ntruth-conditions of counterfactuals depend on background facts and\nlaws. It is challenging to specify these facts and laws in general,\nbut particularly difficult to specify them in non-counterfactual\nterms.\n\n\nThese theses, along with Goodman\u2019s Problem, were once grounds\nfor skepticism about the coherence of counterfactual discourse. But\nwith advances in semantics and pragmatics, they have instead become\nthe central features of counterfactuals that contemporary analyses aim\nto capture.\n",
