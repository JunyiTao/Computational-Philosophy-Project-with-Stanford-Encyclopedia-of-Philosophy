    "main_text": "The Critique of Traditional Aesthetics || Culture and Complexity\n1.3 Culture and Complexity\n\n\nThe central virtue of these lectures is that Wittgenstein never loses\na sense of the complexity of our aesthetic engagements, our\nlanguage attending and in cases manifesting those engagements, and the\ncontextually embedded nature of the aesthetic actions he is working to\nelucidate. Nor does he lose a sense of the relation\u2014a relation\nnecessary to the meaning of the aesthetic language we use \u2013\nbetween the aesthetically-descriptive expressions we employ within\nparticular contexts and \u201cwhat we call the culture of the\nperiod\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8).  Of those aesthetic words, he\nsays, \u201cTo describe their use or to describe what you mean by a\ncultured taste, you have to describe a culture\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 8).  And again making the relation between his work in the\nphilosophy of language and his work in the philosophy of art explicit\n(if again too briefly), he adds, \u201cWhat belongs to a language\ngame is a whole culture\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8). There the link\nto the irreducible character of rule-following is made again as well:\n\u201cTo describe a set of aesthetic rules fully means really to\ndescribe the culture of a period\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8, n. 3).\nIf our aesthetic engagements and the interrelated uses of our\naesthetic terms are widely divergent and context-sensitive, so are our\naesthetic actions and vocabularies context-sensitive in a larger sense\nas well: comparing a cultured taste of fin-de-siecle Vienna\nor early-twentieth-century Cambridge with the Middle Ages, he\nsays\u2014implicitly referring to the radically divergent\nconstellations of meaning-associations from one age to the other,\n\u201cAn entirely different game is played in different ages\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, p. 8).  Of a generic claim made about a person\nthat he or she appreciates a given style or genre of art, Wittgenstein\nmakes it clear that he would not yet know\u2014stated in that\ngeneric, case-transcending way\u2014not merely whether it was true or\nnot, but more interestingly and more deeply, what it meant to\nsay this. The word \u201cappreciates\u201d is, like the rest of our\naesthetic vocabulary, not detachable from the\n particular context within which it has its\n life.[3]\n If, against this diversity or context-sensitivity, we seek to find\nand then analyze what all such cases of aesthetic engagement have in\ncommon, we might well focus on the word\n\u201cappreciation\u201d. But that word will not have meaning with a\nbounded determinacy fixed prior to its contextualized use, which means\nthat we would find ourselves, because of this philosophical strategy\n(the entire field \u201cis very big and entirely\nmisunderstood\u201d), in a double bind: first, we would not know the\nmeaning of the term upon which we were focusing; and second, we would,\nin trying to locate what all cases of aesthetic engagement have in\ncommon, leave out of view what he calls in this connection \u201can\nimmensely complicated family of cases\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966),\nblinding ourselves to nuance and complexity in the name of a\nfalsifying neatness and overarching generality. \u201cIn order to get\nclear about aesthetic words you have to describe ways of living. We\nthink we have to talk about aesthetic judgments like \u2018This is\nbeautiful\u2019, but we find that if we have to talk about aesthetic\njudgments we don't find these words at all, but a word used\nsomething like a gesture, accompanying a complicated\n activity\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 11).\n",
