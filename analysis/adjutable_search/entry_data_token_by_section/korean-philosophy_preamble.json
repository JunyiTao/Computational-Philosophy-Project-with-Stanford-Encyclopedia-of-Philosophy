    "main_text": "\n\nKorean philosophy presents basic and sweeping insights about the nature of human beings and their ways of communal life in society as well as the constitution of reality. Over the past two thousand years or so it has been gradually developing on the Korean peninsula and its adjacent areas sandwiched by the Chinese landmass mainly to the north and the Japanese archipelago mainly to the south. For Korean philosophers, philosophy and its actual practice in communal life typically go hand in hand. In his \u201cTheses on Feuerbach\u201d (1845), Karl Marx famously complained that philosophers have only interpreted the world without altering it. Marx\u2019s criticism, however, would be pointless if directed against Korean philosophy. For the latter has always been preoccupied with altering reality with its practice in the concrete daily context beyond \u201ctheories\u201d (from the Greek verb, \u201ctheorein\u201d). Korean Buddhism, Confucianism and other philosophies are, by their very nature, at bottom, practically oriented, regardless of any shortcomings they are occasionally perceived to have. Thus, Korean philosophy steadily emphasized self-cultivation, character building, and leadership in a community for the sake of promoting public good. In the familiar division of philosophy influenced by Western approaches, we commonly conceive it as being composed of three parts: metaphysics, ethics and epistemology. For Korean philosophy, this would be insufficient. For it does not do justice to the most essential part of it\u2014the art of self-cultivation (or as we can put it, \u201csage learning\u201d) is the most important part of philosophy proper. Just like metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, the art of self-cultivation surely has theoretical components but the most essential component of it is its practical part. One who studies it must not only possess a theoretical understanding of it but also internalize it and actively practice it in his or her concrete relations with others. The practical orientation as a general trend in Korean philosophy stems from the close relation of philosophy with religion in their joint effort to set human beings free from their existential predicaments and shortcomings (Cawley 2019). While religion pursued the liberation through the experience of the unity with the ultimate reality, philosophy tried to help achieve this goal by making sense of the unity, in other words, by giving a conceptual justification of the relation between the ultimate reality and its conditioned manifestations. From the oldest form of Buddhism in Korea in the dawn of the philosophical tradition to the Korean native philosophy of Tonghak (Eastern Learning, see below) as well as the North Korean state philosophy of chuch\u2019e (self-reliance, see below), we witness this general character. All the major philosophical movements in Korea thus developed within, or its close association with, the religious or quasi-religious practices either as the foundations or ramifications.\n\nKorean philosophy is also characterized as the view that relations are more important than the entities that enter into them. It is not entities that make relations possible, but the other way around. In other words, relations are more primitive and real. It is this kind of position that would see the active development of relation-oriented ontology such as the paradigm of ch\u2019e (\u9ad4 Essence)-yong (\u7528 Function) paradigm, mu (\u7121 Nothing) as the matrix of the universe, and the concept of harmony as a reciprocal concept linking i (\u7406 Principle) and ki (\u6c23 Vital Force), inter alia (see below for details). Thus, the basic conceptual tools in Korean philosophy cannot be understood from the perspective of the most typical Western substance-property ontology (H. Kim 2020). An upshot of this is that Korean philosophy is inclined to be monistic. This does not deny the apparent independent existence of the myriad entities\u2014rather it means they are \u201corganic\u201d consequences of fundamental relations. So, the kind of monism one sees in Korean philosophy is not a reductive monism but an organic one in which the myriad things are modalities or manifestations of the basic relations (Jung-Yeup Kim 2015).\n\nIn what follows, I first introduce the philosophical framework against the background of the native belief of shamanism before the Three Kingdoms Period (57 BCE\u2013668 CE; see section 1). This will be followed by a discussion of Buddhist philosophy (section 2) during the Unified Silla dynasty (668\u2013918) and the Kory\u014f dynasty (918\u20131392). I then move on to a systematic presentation/examination of philosophy developed by Neo-Confucianism in the Chos\u014fn dynasty (1392\u20131910; see section 3). The last section discusses modern philosophy in Korea (section 4).\n",
