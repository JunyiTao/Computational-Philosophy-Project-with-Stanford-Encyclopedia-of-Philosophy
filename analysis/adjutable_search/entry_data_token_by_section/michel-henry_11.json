Cultural praxis comports\nwhat Henry designates as its \u201celaborate forms\u201d (e.g., art,\nreligion, discursive knowledge) as well as everyday forms related to\nthe satisfaction of basic needs. Both types of forms, however, fall\nunder the ethical category of subjective self-growth and illustrate\nthe bond between the living and absolute life. The inversion\nof culture in \u201cbarbarism\u201d means that within a particular\nsocio-historical context the need for subjective self-growth is no\nlonger adequately met, and the tendency toward an occultation of the\nbond between the living and absolute life is reinforced. According to\nHenry, who echoes Husserl\u2019s analysis in Crisis, such an\ninversion takes place in contemporary culture, the dominating feature\nof which is the triumph of Galilean science and its technological\ndevelopments (B xiv).\n\nInsofar as it relies on objectification, the \u201cGalilean\nprinciple\u201d is directly opposed to Henry\u2019s philosophy of\nimmanent affectivity. For Henry, science, including modern Galilean\nscience, nonetheless remains a highly elaborated form of culture (B\n62). Although \u201cthe joy of knowing is not always as innocent as\nit seems\u201d, (B 72) the line separating culture from\n\u201cbarbarism\u201d is crossed when science is transformed into\nscientist ideology, i.e., when the Galilean principle is made into an\nontological claim according to which ultimate reality is given only\nthrough the objectively measurable and quantifiable. Here,\nHenry\u2019s critique of scientism functions in parallel with his\ncritique of ontological monism: in both cases, it is ek-static\nappearing that is considered as the only access to reality, which\namounts to the (ideological or philosophical) negation of subjectivity\nas immanent auto-affection. As the Essence of Manifestation\nalready notes in opposition to Hegel but also to Heidegger: \n\n\nObjectification is not possible unless the essence which objectifies\nitself originally arrives in itself [\u2026]. That this original\narriving of the essence in itself be not constituted by\nobjectification, that it cannot, as Hegel and Heidegger would wish, be\nthe consequence hereof, results precisely from its being the condition\nof this objectification. (EM 278)\n\n\nBut the concept of \u201cbarbarism\u201d is not limited to a\ncritique of scientist ideology and its paradigm of objectification.\nMore importantly, it targets the implications of such an ideology on\nthe level of everyday praxis in what Henry terms \u201cpractices of\nbarbarism\u201d. This rather polemical use of the term\n\u201cbarbarism\u201d refers to practices that impoverish rather\nthan develop subjective powers. If it includes the ordinary sense of\nbarbarism as brutality and extreme violence, it is by no means limited\nto it and extends to every form of practice that reverses the movement\nof self-growth inherent to subjectivity. On a societal level, the\nconcept of \u201cbarbarism\u201d becomes a reinterpretation of the\nFreudian \u201cmalaise in civilization\u201d. \u201cThere is a\nmalaise in civilization every time that the energy of Life remains\nunemployed\u201d, explains Henry (B 103). \u201cReverse\u201d forms\nof practice thus illustrate the alienation of subjective praxis\nthrough the domination of the Galilean principle and its technological\noutcomes. With regard to the practice of television, for instance,\nHenry\u2019s critique targets the constant succession from one image\nto the other that makes an aesthetic contemplation impossible. As a\ncorollary to their inconstancy, televised images are also considered\ninsignificant. If they had any significance, they would not only\ncapture attention but would also call for reflection and\ncontemplation. However, this is precisely what an uninterrupted flow\nof images makes impossible:\n\n\nEmergence and disappearance are thus only the continually resumed act\nof life getting rid of itself. It is only in light of such an act that\ndisappearance can become fully intelligible. It presupposes that the\ncontent of the image is of no interest in itself and that it is\ndestined to be replaced by another one. If it were to arouse true\nattention and have a worth of its own, instead, this would imply that\nit would remain and that the perception of it would arouse a growth of\nsensibility and intelligence in the spectator. This would imply that\nthe mind, occupied with this inner work, would latch onto the image\n[\u2026], in the omni-temporality of the cultural object that\ndelivers it to contemplation. But, in such a case, life would no\nlonger seek to flee itself in such an image; instead it would find its\naccomplishment in it, that is to say, in itself. (B 111, translation\nedited)\n\n\nAs this passage indicates, the underlying principle of\n\u201cbarbarism\u201d is that of a flight from subjectivity into\nanonymous processes mastered by techno-science, which are then used\ngradually to replace living praxis. Henry\u2019s concept of\n\u201cbarbarism\u201d can thereby be related to Kierkegaardian\ndespair as \u201csickness unto death\u201d (EM 680\u20131, B\n64\u201366). More precisely, \u201cbarbarism\u201d is seen as the\nultimate form of despair in which the desire to escape oneself as\nliving subjectivity takes the form of a negation of life pure and\nsimple. It is important to note that for Henry such a desire is itself\nrooted in life, i.e., in immanent affectivity, as a desire to escape\nthe tonalities of suffering that life necessarily undergoes.\nConsequently, \u201cbarbarism\u201d is a project impossible to\naccomplish, because life remains itself even through forms of flight\nand negation that Henry does not hesitate to characterize as\n\u201cmadness\u201d (B 52). And it is this movement of fleeing that\nHenry recognizes as constituting the characteristic trait of\nmodernity.\n",
