    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s heritage is rooted in the Spanish diplomatic society\nwith its stress on high education and familiarity with the world\ncommunity. He was born in Madrid, Spain, on 16 December 1863. His\nfather, Agust\u00edn Santayana, was born in 1812. The father studied\nlaw and practiced for a short time before entering the colonial service\nfor posting to the Philippines. While studying law, Agust\u00edn\nserved an apprenticeship to a professional painter of the school of\nGoya and a number of his paintings remain in the private possession of\nthe family. He translated four Senecan tragedies into Spanish, wrote an\nunpublished book about the island of Mindanao, had an extensive\nlibrary, and made three trips around the world. In 1845, he became the\ngovernor of Batang, a small island in the Philippines. He took over the\ngovernorship from the recently deceased Jos\u00e9 Borr\u00e1s y\nBofarull, who was the father of Josefina Borr\u00e1s, later to become\nAgust\u00edn\u2019s wife in 1861 and the mother of George Santayana. His\nmother, Josefina Sturgis (formerly Josefina Borr\u00e1s y Carbonell),\nwas born in Scotland and was the daughter of a Spanish diplomat.\nPreviously she married George Sturgis (d. 1857), a Boston merchant,\nwhose early death left her alone with children in Manila. There were\nfive children from this first marriage, three of whom survived infancy.\nShe promised her first husband to raise the children in Boston where\nshe moved her family. During a holiday in Spain, Josefina met\nAgust\u00edn again, and they were married in 1861. He was fifty years\nof age and she was probably thirty-five. In 1863, Santayana was\nchristened Jorge Agust\u00edn Nicol\u00e1s Ruiz de Santayana y\nBorr\u00e1s. His half sister, Susan, insisted that he be called\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d after her Boston father. Santayana, in turn,\nalways referred to his sister in the Spanish, \u201cSusana.\u201d\n\n1863\u20131886. Santayana lived eight years in Spain,\nforty years in Boston, and forty years in Europe. In his autobiography,\nPersons and Places, Santayana divides his life into three\nphases. The background (1863\u20131886) encompasses his childhood in Spain\nthrough his undergraduate years at Harvard. The second period\n(1886\u20131912) is that of the Harvard graduate student and professor with\na trans-Atlantic penchant for traveling to Europe. The third period\n(1912\u20131952) is the retired professor writing and traveling in Europe\nand eventually establishing Rome as his home.\n\n\nThe family moved from Madrid to \u00c1vila where Santayana spent\nhis boyhood. In 1869, Santayana\u2019s mother left Spain in order to raise\nthe Sturgis children in Boston, keeping her pledge to her first\nhusband. In 1872, his father realized the opportunities for his son\nwere better in Boston, and he moved there with his son. Finding Boston\ninhospitable, puritanical, and cold, the father returned alone to\n\u00c1vila within a few months. The separation between father and\nmother was permanent. In 1888 Agust\u00edn wrote to Josefina:\n\u201cWhen we were married I felt as if it were written that I should\nbe reunited with you, yielding to the force of destiny. Strange\nmarriage, this of ours! So you say, and so it is in fact. I love you\nvery much, and you too have cared for me, yet we do not live\ntogether\u201d (Persons and Places, 9).\n\n\nUntil his father\u2019s death (1893), Santayana regularly corresponded\nwith his father and he visited him after Santayana\u2019s first year at\nHarvard College. In Boston, Santayana\u2019s family spoke only Spanish in\ntheir home. Santayana first attended Mrs. Welchman\u2019s Kindergarten to\nlearn English from the younger children, then he was a student at the\nBoston Latin School, and he completed his B.A. and Ph.D. at Harvard\nCollege (1882\u20131889), including eighteen months of study in Germany on a\nWalker Fellowship. His undergraduate years at Harvard reveal an\nenergetic student with an active social life. He was a member of eleven\norganizations including The Lampoon (largely as a cartoonist),\nthe Harvard Monthly (a founding member), the Philosophical\nClub (President), and the Hasty Pudding.\n\n\nSome scholars conclude that Santayana was an active homosexual based\non allusions in Santayana\u2019s early poetry (McCormick, 49\u201352) and\nSantayana\u2019s association with known homosexual and bisexual friends.\nSantayana provides no clear indication of his sexual preferences, and\nhe never married. Attraction to both women and men seems apparent in\nhis undergraduate and graduate correspondence. The one documented\ncomment about his homosexuality occurs when he was sixty-five. After a\ndiscussion of A. E. Housman\u2019s poetry and homosexuality, Santayana\nremarked, \u201cI think I must have been that way in my Harvard days \u2014\nalthough I was unconscious of it at the time\u201d (Cory, Santayana: The\nLater Years, 40). Because of Santayana\u2019s well-known frankness,\nmany scholars consider Santayana a latent homosexual based on this\nevidence.\n\n1886\u20131912. Santayana received his Ph.D. from\nHarvard in 1889 and became a faculty member at Harvard University\n(1889\u20131912) and eventually a central figure in the era now called\nClassical American Philosophy. He was a highly respected and popular\nteacher, and his students included poets (Conrad Aiken, T. S. Eliot,\nRobert Frost, Wallace Stevens), journalists and writers (Walter\nLippmann, Max Eastman, Van Wyck Brooks), professors (Samuel Eliot\nMorison, Harry Austryn Wolfson), a Supreme Court Justice (Felix\nFrankfurter), many diplomats (including his friend Bronson Cutting),\nand a university president (James B. Conant). He retired from Harvard\nin 1912 at the age of forty-eight and lived the remainder of his life\nin England and Europe, never returning to the U.S. and rejecting\nacademic posts offered at a number of universities, including Harvard,\nColumbia, and Cambridge.\n\n\nSantayana cherished academic life for its freedom to pursue\nintellectual interests and curiosity, but he found that many aspects\nof being a professor infringed on that freedom. Faculty meetings and\nuniversity committees seemed primarily to be partisan heat over false\nissues, so he rarely attended them. The general corporate and\nbusinesslike adaptation of universities was increasingly less\nconducive to intellectual development and growth. He expressed concern\nabout the evolving Harvard goal of producing muscular intellectuals to\nlead America as statesmen in business and government. Were not delight\nand celebration also a central aspect of education? He wrote to a\nfriend in 1892, expressing the hope that his academic life would be\n\u201cresolutely unconventional\u201d and noted that he could only\nbe a professor per accidens, saying that \u201cI would\nrather beg than be one essentially\u201d (GS to H. W. Abbot,\nStoughton Hall, Harvard, 15 February 1892.  Columbia).\n\n\nIn 1893, Santayana experienced a metanoia, a change of\nheart. Gradually he altered his style of life from that of an active\nstudent turned professor to one focused on the imaginative celebration\nof life. In doing so, he began planning for his early retirement,\nfinding university life increasingly less conducive to intellectual\npursuits and delight in living. Three events preceded his\nmetanoia: the unexpected death of a young student, witnessing\nhis father\u2019s death, and the marriage of his sister Susana. Santayana\u2019s\nreflections on these events led to the ancient wisdom that acceptance\nof the tragic leads to a lyrical release. \u201cCultivate imagination,\nlove it, give it endless forms, but do not let it deceive you. Enjoy\nthe world, travel over it, and learn its ways, but do not let it hold\nyou \u2026\u00a0. To possess things and persons in idea is the only pure\ngood to be got out of them; to possess them physically or legally is a\nburden and a snare (Persons and Places, 427\u201328).\u201d\n\n\nIncreasingly, naturalism and the lyrical cry of human imagination\nbecame the focal points of Santayana\u2019s life and thought. Pragmatism, as\ndeveloped by Peirce and James, was an undercurrent in his naturalism,\nparticularly as an approach to how we ascertain knowledge, but there\nare aspects of his naturalism more aligned with European and Greek\nthought that presage developments in the late twentieth century. His\nnaturalism had its historical roots primarily in Aristotle and Spinoza\nand its contemporary background in James\u2019s pragmatism and Royce\u2019s\nidealism. His focus on and celebration of creative imagination in all\nhuman endeavors (particularly in art, philosophy, religion, literature,\nand science) is one of Santayana\u2019s major contributions to American\nthought. This focus, along with his Spanish heritage, Catholic\nupbringing, and European suspicion of American industry, set him apart\nin the Harvard Yard.\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s strong interest in literature and aesthetics is evident\nthroughout this early period, but by 1904, his attention turned almost\nfully to philosophical pursuits. During this period his publications\ninclude: Lotze\u2019s System of Philosophy (dissertation),\nSonnets and Other Verses (1894), The Sense of Beauty\n(1896), Lucifer: A Theological Tragedy (1899),\nInterpretations of Poetry and Religion (1900), A Hermit of\nCarmel, and Other Poems (1901), The Life of Reason (five\nbooks, 1905\u20131906), Three Philosophical Poets: Lucretius, Dante, and\nGoethe (1910).\n\n\nIn May 1911, Santayana formally announced his long-planned\nretirement from Harvard. President Lowell asked him to reconsider. By\nnow Santayana was a highly recognized philosopher, cultural critic,\npoet, and teacher, and his desire to be free from academic confinement\nwas also well known. Lowell indicated he was open to any arrangement\nthat provided Santayana the time he desired for writing and for travel\nin Europe. Initially Santayana agreed to alternate years in Europe and\nthe U.S., but in 1912, his resolve to retire overtook his sense of\nobligation to Harvard. The year before his retirement, he had presented\nat least six lectures at a variety of universities including Berkeley,\nWisconsin, Columbia, and Williams. His books were selling well and his\npublishers were asking for more. Two major universities were courting\nhim. At forty-eight, he left Harvard to become a full-time writer and\nto escape the academic professionalism that nurtured a university\novergrown with \u201cthistles of trivial and narrow scholarship.\u201d\n\n1912\u20131952. As Santayana sailed for Europe, his\nmother died, apparently of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Always attentive to his\nfamily, Santayana visited her weekly, then daily, during his last years\nat Harvard. Knowing his mother\u2019s death was imminent, he arranged for\nJosephine, his half sister, to live in Spain with Susana, who\npreviously had married a well-to-do \u00c1vilan. An inheritance of\n$10,000 from his mother, coupled with his steady income from\npublications and his early planning, made retirement easier. He\narranged for his half brother, Robert, to manage his finances with the\nagreement that upon Santayana\u2019s death, Robert or his heirs would\nreceive the bulk of Santayana\u2019s estate. Hence, in January 1912, at age\nforty-eight, Santayana was free from the constraints of university\nregimen and expectations and, more importantly, free to write, to\ntravel, and to choose his residence and country.\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s book publications after leaving Harvard is remarkable:\nWinds of Doctrine (1913), Egotism in German\nPhilosophy (1915), Character and Opinion in the United\nStates (1920), Soliloquies in England and Later\nSoliloquies (1922), Scepticism and Animal Faith (1923),\nDialogues in Limbo (1926), Platonism and the Spiritual\nLife (1927), the four books of The Realms of Being (1927,\n1930, 1938, 1940), The Genteel Tradition at Bay (1931),\nSome Turns of Thought in Modern Philosophy (1933), The\nLast Puritan (1935), Persons and Places (1944), The\nMiddle Span (1945), The Idea of Christ in the Gospels\n(1946), Dominations and Powers (1951), and My Host the\nWorld (1953, posthumous).\n\n\nHarvard attempted to bring him back to the United States, offering\nhim several professorships beginning in 1917. As late as 1929, he was\noffered the Norton Chair in Poetry, one of Harvard\u2019s most respected\nchairs. In 1931, he received an invitation from Brown University, and\nHarvard later asked him to accept the William James Lecturer in\nPhilosophy, a newly established honorary post. But Santayana never\nreturned to Harvard or to America. Believing that the academic life was\nnot a place for him to cultivate intellectual achievement or scholarly\nwork, Santayana also refused academic appointments both at Oxford\nUniversity and Cambridge University.\n\n\nAt first, Santayana planned to reside in Europe, and after numerous\nexploratory trips to several cities, he decided on Paris. However,\nwhile he was in England, World War I broke out and he was unable to\nreturn to the mainland. First, he lived in London and then primarily at\nOxford and Cambridge. After the war, he was more of a traveling\nscholar, and his principal locales included Paris, Madrid,\n\u00c1vila, the Riviera, Florence, and Rome. By the late 1920s, he\nsettled principally in Rome, and during the summers, he often retreated\nto Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo in Northern Italy to write and to escape the heat.\nBecause of his success as a writer, he assisted friends and scholars\nwhen they found themselves in need of financial support. For example,\nwhen Bertrand Russell was unable to find a teaching post in the U.S. or\nEngland because of his views regarding pacifism and marriage, Santayana\ndisplayed a characteristic generosity in his plan to make an anonymous\ngift to Bertrand Russell of the $25,000 royalty earnings from The\nLast Puritan, at the rate of $5,000 per year, in the letter to\nGeorge Sturgis (15 July 1937). Despite the fact that he and Russell\ndisagreed radically both politically and philosophically, his memory of\ntheir earlier friendship and his regard for Russell\u2019s genius moved him\nto compassion for Russell\u2019s financial plight.\n\n\nThe rise of Mussolini in the 1930s initially seemed positive to\nSantayana. He viewed the Italian civil society as chaotic and thought\nMussolini might bring order where needed. But Santayana soon noted the\nrise of a tyrant. Trying to leave Italy by train for Switzerland, he\nwas not permitted to cross the border because he did not have the\nproper papers. With most of his funds coming from the United States and\nEngland, his case was complicated by his Spanish citizenship and his\nage. He returned to Rome, and on 14 October 1941 he entered the Clinica\ndella Piccola Compagna di Maria, a hospital-clinic run by a Catholic\norder of nuns, where he lived until his death eleven years later. This\narrangement was not unusual. The hospital periodically received\ndistinguished guests and cared for them in an assisted-living\nenvironment. Santayana died of cancer on 26 September 1952.\n\n\nSantayana asked that he be buried in unconsecrated ground, affirming\nhis naturalism to the end. However, the only such cemetery ground in\nRome was reserved for criminals. The Spanish Consulate at Rome would\nnot permit Santayana to be buried in such a place and provided the\n\u201cPanteon de la Obra Pia espanola\u201d in the Campo Verano\ncemetery as a suitable burial ground, turning it into a memorial for\nthe lifelong Spanish citizen. At the graveside, Daniel Cory read lines\nfrom Santayana\u2019s \u201cThe Poet\u2019s Testament,\u201d a poem affirming his\nnaturalistic outlook:\nI give back to the earth what the earth gave,\n\nAll to the furrow, nothing to the grave.\n\nThe candle\u2019s out, the spirit\u2019s vigil spent;\n\nSight may not follow where the vision went.\n\n\nIn the United States, Wallace Stevens commemorated his teacher in\n\u201cTo an Old Philosopher in Rome.\u201d\nTotal grandeur of a total edifice,\n\nChosen by an inquisitor of structures\n\nFor himself. He stops upon this threshold,\n\nAs if the design of all his words takes form\n\nAnd frame from thinking and is realized.\n",
