    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Particular Art Forms: From Music to Literature\n3.3 Particular Art Forms: From Music to Literature\n\nFollowing a Schopenhauerian line of thought, Henry states that music\n\u201cdoes not express the horizon of the world or any of its\nobjects\u201d (AP 292), but affectivity itself, i.e., a\nforce\u2014the Will in Schopenhauer\u2014that lies outside of\nrepresentation. More precisely, music is the immediate reproduction of\na force that lies \u201coutside the world\u201d (PHV III, 264) and\nwhich is in this sense abstract. For Schopenhauer every great\nwork of art is the expression of a force. In architecture for\ninstance, both a Greek temple and a baroque fa\u00e7ade express and\nrepresent forces. The specificity of music, however, lies in the fact\nthat it expresses the Will in an immediate way. Moreover, this\nSchopenhauerian standpoint is taken further with regard to another\nidea to which Henry will agree, namely that of the living body as\nbeing the immediate manifestation of the Will. As the important\nchapter devoted to Schopenhauer in Genealogy of\nPsychoanalysis shows, Henry interprets the Will within the\nframework of his own concept of life as immanent auto-affection or\naffectivity, while at the same time acknowledging that Schopenhauer\nwas \u201cone of the greatest thinkers of all times, albeit a poor\nphilosopher\u201d (AP 292).\n\nThe fact that most of Henry\u2019s writings on art focus either on\npainting or on music does not allow one to conclude that his thesis of\nart as an \u201cintensification of life\u201d would not apply, or\nwould apply any less, to other art forms. Architecture is repeatedly\nused by Henry, for instance in Barbarism where the baroque\nfa\u00e7ade is taken as an example of both expression and\nreproduction (for the spectator) of an immanent play of forces (B\n103).\n\nThe same principle applies to dance. According to Henry, dance is not\nfigurative; its purpose is not \u201cto tell us a story\u201d, but\nto express movement abilities pertaining to the body thereby enabling\nthe spectator to feel these abilities in his or her own body, very\nmuch \u201clike the forms in a painting makes me feel the forces that\nare within me and with which I coincide\u201d (AP 306).\n\nLiterature, too, occupies a special place in Henry\u2019s oeuvre. It\nis the one art that he himself practiced as a novelist\u2014his novel\nL\u2019amour les yeux ferm\u00e9s was awarded the French\nPrix Renaudot in 1976\u2014though literature as an art form is never\nclearly theorized in his philosophy. In a 1991 interview\npublished under the title \u201cNarrer le pathos\u201d (\u201cTo\nNarrate Pathos\u201d) Henry admits that an aesthetic theory of\nliterature still remains a task for his phenomenology. Nonetheless,\nthe interview contains several indications concerning the direction\nsuch a theory would have to take. As the title indicates, novels and\nother forms of fictional writing such as poetry for instance, are\nconceived both as an expression of pathos (from the standpoint of the\nartist) and as its reproduction or intensification (from the\nstandpoint of the reader). As in the case of painting, it is\nHenry\u2019s approach to music that provides the foundation for the\naesthetics of writing. In order to accomplish this task, the words of\nthe poet or those of the novelist must be able to unveil affectivity\nrather than be limited to ek-static appearing as their ultimate\nphenomenological possibility. In the latter case, they are bound to\ngive the thing as absent, as Henry argues while commenting on\nHeidegger\u2019s analysis of Trakl\u2019s poem \u201cEin\nWinterabend\u201d: the snow, the ringing of the bells when the night\nfalls, etc., are brought into presence by the poet\u2019s words, but,\nat the same time, this presence is retrieved from them since they are\ngiven as not really being there. But this is only true in so far as\nthe presence to which words refer is the one that characterizes what\ncan be seen or perceived within the ek-static appearing of the world.\nIn such a context, poetry can only give things through an ambiguous\npresence-absence (\u201cPh\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie\nmat\u00e9rielle et langage\u201d, PHV III, 333). For Henry, it is\nonly when words are envisaged as the expression of pathos that they\nspeak to a living present beneath the words and their representations.\nSuch a language of affectivity would thus have to be largely\ndisconnected from any form of realism and objectivity, while making\nroom for the imaginary as in hallucination, since \u201cin\nhallucination pathos governs directly its own images\u201d (PHV III,\n313).\n\nAs can be seen from Henry\u2019s approach regarding different art\nforms such as painting, music, and literature, art aims, or should\naim, at being an intensification of life as immanent pathos. Life in\nthis sense, however, can be forgotten and its force can be diminished.\nIf therefore, like Henry states, art is an \u201carising of the most\nessential life that breaks through in each of us\u201d, then art also\naccomplishes an \u201cethical oeuvre\u201d (AP 296).\n",
