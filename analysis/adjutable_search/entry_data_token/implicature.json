Speaker Implicature\n\nH. P. Grice (1913\u20131988) was the first to systematically study\ncases in which what a speaker means differs from what the\nsentence used by the speaker means. Consider (1).\n\n(1)\nAlan: Are you going to Paul\u2019s party?\n\nBarb: I have to work.\n\n\nIf this was a typical exchange, Barb meant that she is not\ngoing to Paul\u2019s party by saying that she has to work.\nShe did not say that she is not going to Paul\u2019s party, and the\nsentence she uttered does not mean that. Grice introduced the\ntechnical terms implicate and implicature for the\ncase in which what the speaker said is distinct from what the speaker\nthereby meant or\n implied.[1]\n Thus Barb implicated that she is not going; that she is not going was\nher implicature.\n\nIn (2), Carla is a dispatcher in Denver, where it is sunny and dry.\nDon is a truck driver trying to get over the continental divide during\na blizzard.\n\n(2)\nCarla: How\u2019s the weather over there?\n\nDon: The weather\u2019s lovely.\n\n\nDon is using irony. He said that the weather is lovely, but he thereby\nmeant that the weather is terrible. So he implicated that the weather\nis terrible. Implicating is an illocutionary speech act,\nsomething done in or by saying something (Austin 1962: 98\u2013103).\nSince it involves meaning one thing by saying something else,\nit is an indirect speech act, albeit not one that Searle\n(1975: 265\u20136)\n analyzed.[2]\n\nBy \u201csaying\u201d, Grice meant not the mere utterance of words,\nbut saying that something is the case, which Austin (1962:\n94) called a locutionary act. Barb could have said the\nsame thing by uttering different words. As Grice realized,\n\u201csay\u201d is used more or less\n strictly.[3]\n Thus if Ed says \u201cThe largest planet is a gas giant\u201d, we\nwill sometimes count him as saying that Jupiter is a gas giant. We\nwill follow Grice in using \u201csay\u201d more narrowly, requiring\nthat what a speaker says be something that the sentence uttered means\nor expresses in the context of use. So we will take Ed to have\nimplicated that Jupiter is a gas giant by saying that the largest\nplanet is. Stating or asserting that p\nentails both saying and meaning that\n p.[4]\n When Yogi Berra, famous for his malapropisms, said \u201cTexas has a\nlot of electrical votes\u201d, he said that Texas has a lot of\nelectrical votes; but since that was not something he meant, it was\nnot something he asserted. Don did not mean what he said for a\ndifferent reason. So he too said but did not assert that the weather\nis lovely.\n\nIt is not possible to fully understand speakers without knowing what\nthey have implicated as well as what they have said. Unless we know\nwhat Barb meant by saying that she has to work, we will not know that\nshe has answered Alan\u2019s question. Unless Carla knows what Don\nmeant by saying that the weather is lovely, she might mistakenly infer\nthat he will arrive on time. The difference between saying and\nimplicating also affects how we evaluate speakers. If Barb knew she\ndid not have to work, then she was lying in dialogue\n (1).\n If she knew she was going to Paul\u2019s party, she might be guilty\nof misleading Alan, but not of lying or making a false\n statement.[5]\n In court, witnesses are typically required to answer questions\ndirectly. They cannot avoid perjury by implicating a falsehood rather\nthan saying it.\n\nWhat someone implicates is not given to us directly. We have to\ninfer it from evidence. We would typically infer in\n (1)\n that Barb meant she is not going from what she said, what Alan asked,\nour assumption that Barb was responding to Alan\u2019s question, and\nsome background knowledge (e.g., that going to Paul\u2019s party\nis not work). An implicature can be characterized as an inference\n(\u201csomething inferred\u201d), but implicating is not itself\ninferring. To implicate something is to express a belief in a\nparticular way. To infer something is to acquire or possess a belief\nin a particular way. Hearers have to infer what speakers implicate.\nBut implicatures do not result from inferences. \nFurthermore, the fact that implicatures are inferred is not what makes\nimplicating an indirect speech act. Implicature is indirect because to\nimplicate something is to mean it by saying something\nelse.\n\nEven though it requires an inference, our recognition of what is meant\nis commonly automatic and effortless, whether it is said or\nimplicated. In\n (1),\n for example, competent speakers will grasp immediately that Barb\nmeant both that she has to work and that she is not going to\nPaul\u2019s party. All speech acts have to be inferred from\ncontextual evidence, including what was said and what words were\nuttered. Whether there is any significant difference in the kind of\ninference required to recognize an implicature is a matter of some\ndebate, and may depend on the type of\n implicature.[6]\n While it is not our focus here, how competent hearers recognize---and\nlanguage learners acquire the ability to recognize---what a speaker\nimplicates is the subject of intensive experimentation and theorizing\nin the field of\n pragmatics.[7]\n\nGrice used his technical term \u201cimplicature\u201d for a way of\nexpressing a proposition by saying that something is the case. \nIt is also common to express propositions by asking questions or\nissuing imperatives (Geurts 2010: 32\u20133), to express attitudes and\nother things that are not propositions by saying something (Braun\n2011; Sullivan 2023: \u00a7V), and to express things by not saying\nsomething (Swanson 2017).  While these acts do not count as\nimplicature as Grice defined his technical term, and are not the focus\nof his theory (or this entry), they are similar in many important\nways.\n2. Conversational and Conventional Implicature\n\nThe implicatures in\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n are conversational. They depend on features of the\nconversational context, and are not determined by the conventional\nmeaning of the sentences uttered. A key feature in (1) was\nAlan\u2019s question. Had he asked \u201cWhat are you going to do\ntoday?\u201d, Barb could have implicated something completely\ndifferent (that she is going to work) by saying the same thing (that\nshe has to work). Grice (1975: 25) contrasted a conversational\nimplicature with a conventional implicature, by which he\nmeant one that is determined by the meaning of the sentence\n used.[8]\n Here\u2019s a variant of Grice\u2019s example.\n\n(3)\n\n\na.\nThe queen is English and therefore brave.\nb.\nThe queen is English and brave.\nc.\nBeing brave follows from being English.\n\n\n\n\nWe will use parentheses to refer to the sentences in an example like\n(3), and brackets to refer to what the sentences express. So (3c) is\nthe sentence \u201cBeing brave follows from being English\u201d and\n[3c] is the proposition that being brave follows from being English.\nBy using (3a) to say and mean [3a], speakers implicate [3c]. That is,\nby using (3a) to say and mean that the queen is English and therefore\nbrave, speakers implicate that being brave follows from being English.\nThey imply rather than say that being brave follows\nfrom being English. In contrast, (3b) would rarely if ever be used to\nimplicate [3c]. The meaning of \u201ctherefore\u201d generates the\nimplicature of (3a). Other words \u201ctriggering\u201d conventional\nimplicatures are but, even, too, still, yet, already, again, stop,\nstart, know, and\n regret.[9]\n\nWhile Grice\u2019s examples were triggered lexically, other\nconventional implicatures are triggered syntactically. Speakers who\nassert Ravel, a Spaniard, wrote Spanish-style music implicate\nthat Ravel was a Spaniard\u2014they imply but do not say that Ravel\nwas a Spaniard. Hence their utterance is misleading but not a lie if\nthey know Ravel was French. The implicature is conventional in that it\nis determined by the meaning of the sentence via the appositive\nconstruction. Other constructions that generate conventional\nimplicatures are as-parentheticals (as a Spaniard) and\nparenthetical relative clauses (who was Spanish).\n\nAs\n (1)\n illustrates, when a conversational implicature is false, the\nspeaker\u2019s statement is misleading. Barb\u2019s utterance would\nnonetheless be linguistically flawless. Because [3c] is false, on the\nother hand, the use of\n (3a)\n to make a statement is infelicitous and improper as\nwell as misleading. The truth of [3c] is a precondition of properly\nusing\n (3a)\n to assert what it says. Conventional implicatures like [3c] are\npresuppositions in the non-technical sense in which the\nquestion \u201cHave you cheated again?\u201d presupposes that you\ncheated before. The question is inappropriate, and cannot be given a\nstraight \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answer, unless you did\ncheat before. For the same reason, the question Is the queen\nEnglish and therefore brave? is improper; answering either\n\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d implies a connection between\nbeing English and\n brave.[10]\n\nNot all conventional implicatures are presuppositions in the same way.\nFor example, Jack knows that 51 is prime entails and\nimplicates that 51 is prime. So it is false and possibly a lie because\n51 is not prime.  Nevertheless, it is linguistically proper and\nfelicitous.  That 51 is prime is an implicature because speakers\nwho use Jack knows that 51 is prime imply rather than say or\nassert that 51 is prime; they imply it by saying that Jack knows 51 is\nprime.  In both cases, if and that\u2019s  a good (or\nbad) thing is added, that will refer to what is said but\nnot what is implicated (cf. Geurts 2010:\n 6).[11]\n\nPotts (2005: 35\u20136) claimed that a sentence cannot be\nused with its conventional meaning without implicating its\nconventional\n implicatures.[12] \n While this is a natural way to interpret Grice\u2019s claim that\nconventional implicatures are determined by sentence meaning, examples\nlike (4) show that it is too\n strong.[13]\n\n(4)\n\n\na.\nIf the queen is English, and being brave follows from being\nEnglish, then the queen is English and therefore brave.\nb.\nTrump, the stable genius, started a trade war (said\n  ironically). \n\n\n\n(3a)\n is used with its conventional meaning in (4a) as the consequent of a\nconditional. But because\n (3c)\n is a conjunct of the antecedent of that conditional, (4a) itself does\nnot imply in any way that being brave follows from being English. A\nspeaker asserting [4a] does not say [3a] and does not mean [3c]. So\nthe speaker does not implicate that being brave follows from being\nEnglish. The antecedent of [4a] prevents the conversational\nimplicature of its consequent from \u201cprojecting\u201d. The\nimplicature triggered by the appositive in (4b) is not implicated for\na completely different reason. When this sentence is used ironically,\nthe speaker uses it with its conventional meaning and says that Trump,\nthe stable genius, started a trade war. But because it is used to mock\nTrump\u2019s claim that he is a stable genius, the speaker does not\nimplicate that Trump is a stable genius. Indeed, he implicates the\nvery opposite. The meaning of a sentence determines its conventional\nimplicatures, but whether a speaker implicates them depends on how the\nsentence is used. What does entail implicating a sentence\u2019s\nconventional implicatures is using it to assert what the sentence\nmeans or expresses.  Doing that does not necessitate any\nconversational implicatures. \n\nWhile Grice used \u201cconventional\u201d to denote an implicature\ndetermined by linguistic meaning, W. Davis (1998: Chs. 5\u20136) and\nLepore & Stone (2015: Pt. II) argue that even conversational\nimplicatures can be conventional in the non-technical sense in which\nit is conventional for women to wear a sari in India but not Mongolia,\nand for German speakers to use rot to mean \u201cred\u201d\nbut not English\n speakers.[14]\n Conventions in this sense are common practices that serve a social\ninterest, perpetuate themselves in certain ways, and are arbitrary in\nthat other practices could have served the same purposes and\nperpetuated themselves. New speakers pick up conventions from prior\nspeakers, often with no instruction. Consider (5):\n\n(5)\n\n\na.\nSome athletes smoke.\nb.\nNot all athletes smoke.\n\n\n\nIt would be unconventional (unusual, idiosyncratic, even\nunprecedented) for people who say \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d to\nconversationally implicate that some physically fit people will\ndevelop bladder cancer, but conventional (customary, normal, standard\npractice) for them to implicate that not all athletes smoke. The\ncustomary implicature is not conventional in Grice\u2019s sense,\nthough. For \u201cNot all athletes smoke\u201d is not determined by\nthe meaning of \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d. Speakers can and\noften do say and assert\n (5a)[15]\nwhile implicating something other than\n [5b],\n as\n (6)\n will illustrate. The practice of using sentences of the form\n\u201cSome NP VP\u201d to mean \u201cNot all\nNP VP\u201d is not a semantic or syntactic convention. It is\na pragmatic convention. To avoid confusion, I will describe\nimplicatures that are conventional in Grice\u2019s sense as\nsemantic. When not modified by \u201cin Grice\u2019s\nsense\u201d, \u201cconventional\u201d will have the broader sense\nof\n customary.[16]\n\nGrice (1975: 37ff) called implicatures like\n [5b]\n generalized conversational implicatures\n(\u201cGCIs\u201d). The term is appropriate because\n (5a)\n can be used to implicate\n [5b]\n in a wide variety of contexts. Grice characterized generalized\nimplicatures as those that \u201cwould normally (in the absence of\nspecial circumstances)\u201d be carried by \u201cthe use of a\ncertain form of words\u201d. Levinson (2000: 11\u201312,\n16\u201322, 42\u201346) characterized GCIs similarly as\n\u201cdefault inferences\u201d\u2014implicatures we normally and\nautomatically infer in the absence of evidence to the\n contrary.[17]\n These characterizations are too strong in one respect. There is\nnothing abnormal about the use of\n (5a)\n in (6), where Gina would normally implicate [6a] rather than\n [5b].\n\n(6)\nFred: Do you know whether all athletes smoke?\n    Gina: Some athletes smoke.\n    \na.\nI do not know whether all athletes smoke.\n\n\n\nThe fact that \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d can be used to\nimplicate\n [5b]\n in some contexts and\n [6a]\n in others shows that neither is the default, especially given that\nfigurative use with a variety of implicatures is also\na possibility (\u00a74).  The same fact also shows that\nneither is a conventional implicature in Grice\u2019s sense. Having\nmore than one GCI is compatible with them all being conventional in\nthe broad sense, though. The word bank has several meanings\nin English, including \u201crow\u201d, as in bank of\nswitches. So it is conventional to use bank to mean\n\u201crow\u201d, even though this cannot be described as its normal\nor default use.\n\nFollowing Grice (1975: 39), it is widely accepted that generalized\nconversational implicatures differ from semantic implicatures in being\ncancelable, either explicitly or implicitly\n (contextually).[18]\nWhereas (3a) cannot be asserted without implicating [3c],\n (5a) can\n be asserted without implicating\n [5b].\n The speaker may do this explicitly by adding \u201cIndeed, all\ndo\u201d after uttering \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d.\nAlternatively, the implicature may be cancelled implicitly by the\nutterance context, as when it is obvious that the speaker is either\nengaging in understatement or ignorant of further facts.  An\nactual implicature is cancelable if it could have been canceled. \nIn example (1), Barb would not have implicated that she is not going\nto Paul\u2019s party if she had added \u201cBut I might be able to\nleave early.\u201d\n\nWhereas semantic implicatures are generally entailed by what is said,\nmany believe that conversational implicatures cannot\n be.[19]\n As\n (1),\n (2),\n (5),\n and\n (6) illustrate, conversational implicatures\n are typically not entailments. But exceptions have been\n noted.[20]\n When a speaker responds to \u201cIs Tom 65 or blind?\u201d by\n asserting \u201cTom is 65,\u201d the speaker may well have answered\n the question by implicating that Tom is 65 or blind.  That is, the\n speaker may have meant that disjunction by saying that Tom is 65.\n Neale (1992: 529) believes the cancelability of conversational\n implicatures prevents them from being entailments. But while an\n entailed implicature cannot be explicitly canceled if the result\n would be incoherent (\u201cTom is 65, but is not 65 or\n blind\u201d), it can at least be implicitly canceled.  This can\n happen if the speaker answers the simple question \u201cHow old is\n Tom?\u201d in a context in which no one is thinking about blindness.\n Even explicit cancellation is possible in some cases.  A\n mathematician could implicate that Tom\u2019s age is a prime number\n by saying that it is 67.  One form of explicit cancellation\n (\u201cTom\u2019s age is 67, but not prime\u201d) would be\n necessarily false, and indicate that the speaker is not a math whiz,\n but it is not incoherent.  Another form (\u201cTom\u2019s age is\n 67, but I don\u2019t know if that is prime\u201d) only indicates\n ignorance.\n\nGrice observed that conversational implicatures are typically\nconnected to what is said rather than the way it is said, so that\n\u201cit is not possible to find another way of saying the same\nthing, which simply lacks the implicature in question\u201d (1975:\n39). The implicature of\n (1)\n is thus said to be nondetachable. Grice allowed exceptions,\nthough, \u201cwhere some special feature of the substituted version\nis itself relevant to the determination of an implicature\u201d (see\nGrice\u2019s \u201cmaxim of Manner\u201d in\n \u00a76).\n Metalinguistic implicatures\u2014those that refer to the particular\nwords the speaker\n used[21]\u2014are\n also detachable.\n\n (7) \nHarry: What is this\nspecies of bird called in English?\n\nIrene: This is a widgeon.\n\n\nIn example (7), Irene used \u201cThis is a widgeon\u201d to\nimplicate that the English word for the species is\n\u201cwidgeon\u201d. Had Irene used a German sentence with the same\nmeaning (Dies ist eine Pfeife) she would have said the same\nthing while implicating something different (that it is called\n\u201cPfeife\u201d). Semantic implicatures, in contrast, are\nnondetachable because they are determined by what the sentence\nmeans.\n3. Sentence Implicature\n\nAs we observed in\n \u00a71,\n Grice defined implicating as a form of speaker meaning. But Grice and\nothers nevertheless began applying \u201cimplicate\u201d to\nsentences, analogous to the way \u201cimply\u201d,\n\u201cpresuppose\u201d, and \u201cmean\u201d apply to sentences as\nwell as\n people.[22]\n If an implicature is conventional in either sense (that is, either\nsemantic or generalized), we may say that the sentence\nimplicates it, or has the\n implicature.[23]\n Even though Barb implicates that she is not going to Paul\u2019s\nparty, \u201cI have to work\u201d does not itself implicate this.\nBut \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d implicates that not all do even\nthough speakers can use the sentence without implicating this.\n(Analogy: plane means \u201cairplane\u201d even though\nspeakers can use plane without meaning\n\u201cairplane\u201d.) Similarly,\n (4b)\n implies that Trump is a stable genius even though speakers can use it\nwithout implying that.\n\nWhereas knowledge of what speakers implicate is essential to fully\nunderstand speakers, knowledge of what sentences implicate is a\ncritical component of our knowledge of a language. This is obvious for\nsentences with semantic implicatures like\n (3a).\n But speakers are not fully competent with \u201csome\u201d unless\nthey know that it is related to \u201call\u201d in a way it is not\nrelated to \u201cseveral\u201d or \u201ctwo\u201d. A man using\n (5a)\n may mislead others if he does not realize that it implicates\n [5b],\n and fail to communicate if he thinks it implicates \u201cIt is not\nthe case that several athletes smoke\u201d.\n4. Common Forms of Conversational Implicature\n\nMany forms of conversational implicature occur frequently in everyday\nspeech and literature, with a wide variety of sentences and in all\nknown languages. They are common ways of both using and understanding\nlanguage. The forms are differentiated in part by the relationship\nbetween what is said and what is implicated. Knowledge of them is an\nimportant component of our linguistic competence, and is acquired at\nan early\n age.[24]\n\nThe most widely recognized forms of implicature are figures\nof speech (tropes). Irony, overstatement (hyperbole),\nunderstatement (meiosis and litotes), and metaphor have been known at\nleast since Aristotle. They are taught in school as elements of style.\nWhen Don said in\n (2)\nThe weather is lovely, he engaged in irony and\nimplicated that the weather is awful. Don did so in part to make light\nof the awful weather. Don could have implicated the same thing by\nsaying The weather is not good (litotes) or The weather\nis the worst in history (hyperbole).\n\nFigurative speech is non-literal: users generally do not mean\nwhat they say, and expect their audience to recognize that. (Litotes\nis an exception.) Don did not mean that the weather is lovely. \nThe obvious falsity of what is said is a typical clue that speech is\nfigurative. Some figures also tend to be marked intonationally,\nincluding irony and hyperbole. Others are not, including metaphor and\nunderstatement. They are all used to make speech lively, interesting,\nand stylish\n (\u00a710).\n\nMany forms of implicature are not figures of speech, and have become\nwidely recognized only since Grice (1975).\n (1)\n illustrates relevance implicature: the speaker implicates an\nanswer to an expressed or implied question by stating something\nrelated to it by implication or explanation.\n [5b]\n is a quantity (or scalar) implicature: the speaker\nimplicates the denial of a proposition stronger than the one said.\n (6)\n illustrates ignorance implicature: the speaker implicates\nthat something stronger than what was said is unknown.\n (7)\n illustrates metalinguistic implicature: the speaker\nimplicates that something has a certain name by using that name to\ndescribe it. These \u201cmodes of speech\u201d (non-figurative forms of\nimplicature) are not taught in school, and names for them are not in\ngeneral use. Nevertheless, they are as frequent and natural as\nfigurative speech, and are learned at the same time. Modes of speech\nare not marked intonationally, and the speech is literal. They are not\nused to make speech or writing lively. Speakers do not intend what\nthey say to be obviously false, and generally do mean what they\nsay.\n\nTwo modes of speech do have common names. One is damning with\nfaint praise. Grice\u2019s example has become classic:\n\n\nA is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a\nphilosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: \u201cDear Sir, Mr.\nX\u2019s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at\ntutorials has been regular. Yours, etc\u201d. (Grice 1975: 33)\n\n\nBy saying so little, A implicated that Mr. X is a poor candidate for\nthe job. The other named mode is loose use, or speaking\nloosely, illustrated by (8):\n\n (8) \nLinda: When will\ndinner be served?\n\nMike: At six o\u2019clock.\n\n\nIf Mike\u2019s response is typical, what he meant is only that dinner\nwill be served close enough to six o\u2019clock for current\npurposes. That would be typically be true if dinner will be\nserved at 6:01. What Mike said, though, is that dinner will be served\nat 6:00, which would be false if dinner is served at\n 6:01.[25]\n If Mike gave the same response to a question about when a swimmer\ntouched the wall in the final lap of an Olympic event, 6:01 may not be\nclose enough.\n\nThe figures and modes of speech are common, socially useful practices.\nThey perpetuate themselves through precedent following, social\nacceptance, individual habit and association, and traditional\ntransmission from one generation of speakers to another. Precedent\noperates when hearers call on their knowledge of the forms speakers\ncommonly use to either interpret speakers in new contexts, or to\npredict what hearers will understand. The forms are less arbitrary\nthan lexical or syntactic conventions, but no one has to implicate\nrather than say things, or use one form of implicature rather than\nothers.\n\nSince these conventions do not attach implicatures to particular\nsentence forms, they do not give rise to sentence implicatures.\n5. Pragmatics and Semantics\n\nAs our examples make clear, semantics, conceived as the study\nof the meaning of words and sentences, does not exhaust the study of\nmeaning. The study of speaker meaning and implicature is included in\npragmatics, which covers the broad range of speech acts\nperformed by using words and sentences. Applied pragmatics\narose from the recognition that second language learners cannot become\nfully proficient without mastering more than grammar and literal\nmeaning (Kasper 2003; Zufferey et al 2019: Ch. 9). Forensic\npragmatics studies the use of pragmatics in law enforcement\nand the courts (Solan & Tiersma 2005; Zufferey et al.\n2019: \u00a74.4). Clinical pragmatics studies\ncommunication disorders that arise from failure to master pragmatic\nrules (Cummings 2009, 2014; Graci 2023). Formal pragmatics\nuses formal models of utterances, contexts, and discourse to state\nprecise rules specifying the interpretation of an utterance in a\ncontext, including what is both said and implicated (Roberts 2006;\nRothschild 2013).\n\nThe phenomenon of Gricean conventional implicature\n (\u00a72)\n shows further that standard truth-conditional semantics does not\nexhaust semantics (Barker 2003). For example, Ravel, a Spaniard,\nwrote Spanish-style music and Ravel was a Spaniard and wrote\nSpanish-style music have the same entailments. Yet they differ in\nmeaning in such a way that the former but not the latter is\ninfelicitous and improper because Ravel was French.\n\u201cFalse\u201d clearly applies to the latter but not clearly to\nthe former.\n\nImplicature is important even in truth-conditional semantics. For\nexample, logicians customarily take sentences of the form\n\u201cp or q\u201d to be true provided\n\u201cp\u201d or \u201cq\u201d or both\nare true. Thus \u201cIt is not the case that cats meow or purr\u201d\nwould be counted as false. But there are also cases in which speakers\nuse \u201cp or q\u201d to mean that\n\u201cp\u201d or \u201cq\u201d is true but\nnot both. This would be the natural way to interpret someone who\nsaid \u201cJohn is going to invite Mary or Jane to the prom\u201d.\nSome maintain that \u201cor\u201d is ambiguous in English,\nwith an inclusive and an exclusive sense. But another possibility is\nthat the exclusive interpretation is a generalized conversational\nimplicature. One piece of evidence supporting the implicature\nhypothesis is that the exclusive interpretation seems cancelable. Thus\n\u201cJane will visit France or Germany this summer; indeed, she will\ndrive through both on her way to Poland\u201d has no contradictory\ninterpretation. Some evidence against the implicature hypothesis is\nthat after \u201cp or q,\u201d or both does not seem any more\nredundant than but not both.  A methodological issue is\nto describe the evidence necessary to decide whether a particular\ninterpretation is a sense or a generalized conversational implicature.\nA foundational issue to is describe exactly what the difference\nconsists in.\n\nImplicature continues to be invoked in this way to defend\ncontroversial semantic claims:\n\nKnowledge. The standard of justification necessary to\nclaim knowledge varies from context to context depending on what is at\nstake and salient. On contextualist theories, sentences of the form\n\u201cS knows p\u201d are indexical, with\ndifferent truth conditions in different contexts (S. Cohen 1986, Lewis\n1996, DeRose 2009). An alternative theory is that \u201cS\nknows p\u201d has a strict invariant semantics, but is used\nloosely to implicate that S is close enough to knowing for\nthe purposes of the context (W. Davis 2007b). Another is that\n\u201cS knows p\u201d has a weak invariant\nsemantics but its negation is used to implicate that contextually\nrelevant alternatives cannot be ruled out (Rysiew 2001; Brown 2006;\nHazlett 2007).  Others argue that implicatures cannot account for\nthe data (Blome-Tillman 2013b; Dinges 2018;\n 2021).[26]\nNames. The Millian theory that the meaning of a name is\nits referent entails that coreferential names are synonymous, and that\nnames without a referent are meaningless. This seems untenable in\nlight of names like \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cClark\nKent\u201d. Millians have proposed that the source of these\nlinguistic intuitions is a difference in implicature (Salmon 1986;\nSoames 1989). One hypothesis invokes metalinguistic implicature,\nnoting that \u201cClark Kent can fly\u201d implicates that a man\ncalled \u201cClark Kent\u201d can fly (McKay 1981; Berg 1988, 2012).\nOne problem is its implication that the Chinese translation of\n\u201cLois Lane believes Superman can fly\u201d should seem as false\nas \u201cLois Lane believes Clark Kent can fly\u201d.\nNegation. On the regular interpretation of (9) below,\n\u201csome\u201d is equivalent to \u201cany\u201d, and the whole\nsentence is contradictory:\n\n\n(9)  The boy\ndid not eat some of the cookies, he ate all the cookies.\n\n\nBut there is another interpretation, marked \nby\n intonation[27]\n and other features, on which the negation in (9) denies the\n\u201cnot all\u201d implicature of \u201cThe boy ate some of the\ncookies\u201d, and is thus consistent. The question is how to account\nfor the two different interpretations of negations given that the word\n\u201cnot\u201d seems unambiguous (Geurts 1998). Horn (1989:\n362\u20134; 370\u20135) and Burton-Roberts (1989) propose that the\nmarked interpretation of (9) is an implicature. W. Davis (2016: Ch. 6)\nargues that it is an idiom that plausibly evolved from a generalized\nconversational implicature.  Soria-Ruiz (2023) proposes a\nneo-Stalnakerian account.\n\n\nImplicature plays a well-attested diachronic role in\ngrammaticalization and the origin of new meanings and\n idioms.[28]\n For example, metaphors have a typical life cycle: beginning as\nsomething a speaker means on a particular occasion; being picked up by\nothers; catching on, which means becoming self-perpetuating and\nspreading through the population; and finally, dying and becoming a\nnew lexical meaning or idiom. When dead, what used to be indirectly\nexpressed is directly expressed. The term virus as applied to\ncomputers went through this evolution in the last few decades,\noriginally denoting a biological organism that spreads from host to\nhost, now having another meaning on which it denotes computer programs\nthat spread from computer to computer in a similar fashion. When a\ndead metaphor has syntactic structure like go viral, it is an\nidiom. When metaphors become widespread and\nself-perpetuating, but are not yet idioms, they generate generalized\nconversational\n implicatures.[29]\n6. Gricean Theory\n\nIn addition to identifying the phenomenon of implicature, and\nclassifying its types, Grice developed a theory designed to explain\nand predict conversational implicatures and to describe how they are\nunderstood. Grice (1975: 26\u201330) postulated a general\nCooperative Principle and four maxims specifying how\nto be cooperative. It is common knowledge, he asserted, that people\ngenerally follow these rules for efficient communication.\n\n\nCooperative Principle. Contribute what is required by\nthe accepted purpose of the conversation.\n\nMaxim of Quality. Make your contribution true; so do not\nconvey what you believe false or\n unjustified.[30]\n\nMaxim of Quantity. Be as informative as required.\nMaxim of Relation. Be relevant.\nMaxim of Manner. Be perspicuous; so avoid obscurity and\nambiguity, and strive for brevity and order.\n\n\n\nGrice viewed these not as arbitrary conventions, but as instances of\ngeneral rules governing rational, cooperative behavior. For example,\nif Jane is helping Kelly build a house, she will hand Kelly a hammer\nrather than a tennis racket (relevance), more than one nail when\nseveral are needed (quantity), and straight nails rather than bent\nones (quality); she will do all this quickly and efficiently\n(manner).\n\nRelevance implicatures like\n (1)\n are thought to arise from the maxim of Relation. Barb would have\ninfringed this maxim unless her contribution were relevant to the\npurpose of the conversation. If Barb was being cooperative, then she\nwas trying to answer Alan\u2019s question. Given that working is\nincompatible with partying, it is inferred that Barb must have\nintended to communicate that she is not going to the party. Grice\n(1975: 34) thought other implicatures arise by flouting\nmaxims. This happens when what a cooperative speaker says so patently\nviolates a maxim that the hearer must infer that the speaker means\nsomething different. Irony is thought to arise from flouting the maxim\nof Quality\n (\u00a79).\n\nGeneralizing from such examples, Grice provided a theoretical account\nof conversational implicature that has been widely\n adopted.[31]\n A representative formulation goes as follows, with S the\nspeaker and H the hearer.\n\n\nTheoretical Definition: S conversationally\nimplicates p iff S implicates p when:\n\nS is presumed to be observing the Cooperative Principle\n(Cooperative Presumption);\nThe supposition that S believes p is required to\nmake S\u2019s utterance consistent with the Cooperative\nPrinciple (Determinacy); and\nS believes (or knows), and expects H to believe\nthat S believes, that H is able to determine that\n(ii) is true (Mutual Knowledge).\n\n\n\nThis says that an implicature is conversational provided conditions\n(i)\u2013(iii) are satisfied, where (ii) is the condition that\nS\u2019s believing p is required for\nS to be in conformity with the Cooperative Principle. The\nTheoretical Definition does not entail that S implicated p is\ninferable from (i)\u2013(iii). Calculability does that.\n\n\nCalculability: Conversational implicatures must be\ncapable of being worked\n out.[32]\n\n\nGrice\u2019s calculability principle says more than that hearers are\ngenerally able to infer what speakers implicate on the basis of the\nlinguistic meaning of what they utter. That would not be distinctive\nof implicature given that the same is true of what people\n say.[33]\n To work out an implicature is to infer it in a specific way\nfrom the Cooperative Principle using particular facts about the\nmeaning of the sentence uttered and the context of utterance.\n\n\nTo work out that a particular conversational implicature is present,\nthe hearer will rely on the following data: (1) the conventional\nmeaning of the words used, together with the identity of any\nreferences that may be involved; (2) the Cooperative Principle and its\nmaxims; (3) the context, linguistic or otherwise, of the utterance;\n(4) other items of background knowledge; and (5) the fact (or supposed\nfact) that all relevant items falling under the previous headings are\navailable to both participants and both participants know or assume\nthis to be the case. A general pattern for the working-out of a\nconversational implicature might be given as follows: He has said\nthat q; there is no reason to suppose that he is not observing the\nmaxims, or at least the Cooperative Principle [Cooperative\nPresumption]; he could not be doing this unless he thought that\np [Determinacy]; he knows (and knows that I know that he\nknows) that I can see that the supposition that he thinks that\np is required [Mutual Knowledge]; he has done nothing to stop\nme thinking that p; he intends me to think, or is at least\nwilling to allow me to think, that p; and so he has\nimplicated that p. (Grice 1975: 31; my emphasis\nand insertions)\n\n\nKey steps of the working out schema have been named in brackets,\ncorresponding to (i)\u2013(iii) in the Theoretical\n Definition.[34]\n\nIn addition to postulating that the conversationality of an\nimplicature depends on the Cooperative Presumption, Determinacy, and\nMutual Knowledge conditions, and that the implicature can be inferred\nin part from their satisfaction, Grice claimed that the conditions\ngive rise to or generate the implicatures.\nThe implicatures exist because conditions\n(i)\u2013(iii) are\n satisfied.[35]\n From his assumption that conversational implicatures can be explained\nand predicted on the basis of the Cooperative Principle, Grice drew a\nmethodological conclusion:\n\n\nGrice\u2019s Razor: Other things equal, it is\npreferable to postulate conversational implicatures rather than\nsenses, semantic implicatures, or semantic presuppositions because\nconversational implicatures can be derived from independently\nmotivated psycho-social\n principles.[36]\n\n\nThe pithy formulation is \u201cSenses are not to be multiplied beyond\nnecessity\u201d, alluding to Ockham. If a phenomenon can be explained\nand predicted in terms of psycho-social principles, then it is\ntheoretically more economical to do so than to posit senses and the\nlike, which cannot be so explained. Grice\u2019s Razor is often\ninvoked to support classifying the exclusive interpretation of\n\u201cp or q\u201d as an implicature rather than\nas a second sense\n (\u00a75).\n\nFollowing Grice, \u201cconversational implicature\u201d was defined\nin\n \u00a72\n to mean an implicature that depends on features of the\nconversational context and is not determined by the conventional\nmeaning of the sentence uttered. On this definition,\nGrice\u2019s Theoretical Definition and Calculability are empirical\nhypotheses that may turn out to be false. Indeed, we will review\nevidence against these hypotheses below. Many linguists and\nphilosophers, however, take Calculability to be true by definition.\nThey take \u201cconversational implicature\u201d to mean an\nimplicature that can be worked out from what is said and the\nCooperative Principle or its\n maxims.[37]\n If this definition is adopted, then what the evidence would show is\nthat the implicatures illustrated in\n \u00a7\u00a71\u20134\n are not conversational, even those that are not conventional in\nGrice\u2019s sense (cf. Lepore & Stone 2015: 6, 83, 148).\n7. Theoretical Difficulties\n\nWhile Grice viewed his ideas as tentative and exploratory, followers\nhave taken the theory to be well established. Indeed, it has served as\na paradigm for research in pragmatics. Serious difficulties have\nemerged, though.\n\nAccording to Grice\u2019s Theoretical Definition\n (\u00a76),\n conversational implicatures depend on a presumption that the speaker\nis observing the Cooperative Principle. W. Davis (1998: \u00a72.5)\nnotes, however, that speakers can engage in implicature when there is\nno conversation. All the figures and modes of speech can appear in\nprivate journals or in manuscripts that have little hope of being\nread.\n [38]\n\nThe Cooperative Principle further assumes that the participants in\nevery conversation strive only to achieve common goals. From the\nperspective of social psychology, evolutionary biology, and game\ntheory, Pinker (2007) and Asher & Lascarides (2013)\nobserve that pure cooperation is generally an unrealistic\nidealization or naive assumption. Conversations are often among\nadversaries, whose goals beyond communication are opposed. It would be\nfoolhardy and possibly dangerous for an interrogator to presume that a\nprisoner of war or terrorism suspect is being cooperative. Even when\nparticipants are friends or relatives, they often have some divergent\ngoals, and may give priority to other principles\n (\u00a710).\n To the extent that they diverge, the speaker\u2019s goals may be\npromoted and the hearer\u2019s goals thwarted by withholding\ninformation, providing misinformation, going off on a tangent, or\nbeing obscure. Even when it is correctly presumed that a speaker is\nnot being cooperative, the speaker may use all the figures and modes\nof speech. If the prosecuting attorney asks the defendant whether he\nwas in the bank on the day of the robbery, the defendant might answer\n\u201cI took my mother to the hospital that day\u201d, thereby\nimplicating that he was not at the bank. He may do this in the hope of\nmisleading the jury as well as the prosecutor. The official purpose of\nthe conversation is to get at the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\nbut the truth. But the defendant\u2019s purpose is to hide it.\n\nMany conversations have goals other than the exchange of information.\nOne is amusement, which speakers often pursue by making jokes (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: \u00a711.3). Because the goal is not to provide\ninformation, the maxims of Quality, Quantity, and Relation do not\napply. If for any of these reasons the Cooperative Principle does not\napply, reasoning based on it will be unsound.\n8. Overgeneration\n\nMany have observed that for every implicature that appears to be\ncorrectly predicted by Gricean theory, others appear to be falsely\n predicted.[39]\n The schema used to \u201cwork out\u201d observed implicatures can\nusually be used just as well to work out nonexistent implicatures. So\nthe schema as formulated is invalid\u2014an unreliable\nmethod of inferring implicatures. By a simple application of\nMill\u2019s Methods, it follows that the observed implicatures do not\nexist because of the Gricean factors.\n\nWe will illustrate using the case that has been most extensively\nstudied, and is generally considered a paradigm application of Gricean\ntheory: the derivation of quantity implicatures from the maxim of\nQuantity. Adapted to\n (5),\n here is Huang\u2019s (2014: 34) formulation.\n\n\nSince the speaker has used a semantically weaker expression (i.e.,\nsome) where a semantically stronger one (e.g., all)\nis available, he would contradict Grice\u2019s Quantity Maxim if the\nsemantically stronger sentence held. Consequently, he believes that\nthe semantically stronger statement does not hold. Furthermore, he has\nnot done anything to stop the addressee thinking that he so thinks,\ntherefore he conversationally implicates that not all athletes\n smoke.[40]\n\n\nIn the typical case represented by\n (5),\n S says \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d and implicates\n\u201cNot all athletes smoke\u201d. The stronger statement\nS does not make is \u201cAll athletes smoke\u201d. There\nare countless relevant statements more informative than what S said,\nhowever, whose negations were not implicated, including Several\nathletes smoke, Some athletes smoke regularly, I know some athletes\nsmoke, and 13% of all athletes smoke. The Gricean\nreasoning could be repeated using any of these stronger statements,\nwith fallacious results. For example:\n\n\nS said \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d. If S were\nin a position to assert the stronger statement \u201cSeveral athletes\nsmoke\u201d but did not, S would be in a breach of the maxim\nof Quantity unless S wished to convey that it does not hold.\nSo S implicated that it is not the case that several athletes\nsmoke.\n\n\nBut speakers who utter sentences of the form \u201cSome S\nare P\u201d rarely if ever implicate the denial of\n\u201cSeveral S are\n P\u201d.[41]\n Among the infinity of statements stronger than \u201cSome athletes\nsmoke\u201d, \u201cAll athletes smoke\u201d is highly unusual in\nthat people commonly implicate its denial. Since the derivations have\nthe same form whether or not their conclusions are observed to be\ntrue, Lepore & Stone (2015: 143ff) call this the\n\u201csymmetry\u201d\n problem.[42]\n The Gricean derivation seems plausible only because we knew\nantecedently that the conclusion is true.\n\nAn irony underscoring the ex post facto character of the\nGricean calculation is that Grice himself derived an\nignorance implicature from the maxim of Quantity.\n\n\nA is planning with B an itinerary for a holiday in France. Both know\nthat A wants to see his friend C, if to do so would not involve too\ngreat a prolongation of his journey:\n\nA: Where does C live?\n\nB: Somewhere in the South of France.\n\n(Gloss: There is no reason to suppose that B is opting out; his answer\nis, as he well knows, less informative than is required to meet\nA\u2019s needs. This infringement of the first maxim of Quantity can\nbe explained only by the supposition that B is aware that to be more\ninformative would be to say something that infringed the second maxim\nof Quality. \u201cDon\u2019t say what you lack adequate evidence\nfor\u201d, so B implicates that he does not know in which town C\nlives.) (Grice 1975: 32\u201333; example number\n deleted)[43]\n\n\nIt is plausible that B would have implicated this. But if\nGrice\u2019s reasoning is valid, why shouldn\u2019t Huang conclude\nthat speakers uttering \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d implicate\nthey do not know whether all athletes smoke (an ignorance\nimplicature)?  If Huang\u2019s reasoning is valid, why\nshouldn\u2019t Grice conclude that B implicated C does not live\nin the southernmost part of France (a scalar implicature)? \n\nAccounting for the differences in implicature described in this\nsection is an outstanding problem for pragmatic theory.\n9. Failures of Determinacy\n\nGrice\u2019s Determinacy condition states that S\nconversationally implicates p only if S has to\nbelieve (and implicate) p if S\u2019s utterance is\nto be consistent with the Cooperative Principle. Determinacy is a key\npremise in the working-out schema, so Calculability depends on it. As\n \u00a78\n illustrated, however, there are normally many alternative ways to be\ncooperative, and contribute what is required by the conversation, even\nwhen the meanings and referents of the words used are taken as\ngiven.\n\nGrice believed irony involves flouting Quality. Here is Grice\u2019s\noft-repeated \u201cgloss\u201d applied to\n (2),\n in which Don said \u201cThe weather\u2019s lovely\u201d during a\nblizzard.\n\n\nIt is perfectly obvious to Don and his audience (Carla) that what Don\nhas said is something he does not believe, and the audience knows that\nDon knows that is obvious to the audience. So \u2026 Don must be\ntrying to get across some other proposition than the one he purports\nto be putting forward. This must be some obviously related\nproposition; the most obviously related proposition is the\ncontradictory of the one he purports to be putting forward. (After\nGrice 1975:\n 34).[44]\n\n\nWhile irony often involves saying something obviously false, it need\nnot have been obvious to Carla in\n (2)\n that Don believed the weather was unlovely. She may have had no\nindependent source of information about his weather. Don would also\nhave made a suitable contribution to the conversation if he had meant\nand believed that the weather is lovely. So Determinacy is unsatisfied\nin irony when the speaker could have been speaking literally,\nbelieving what was said (W. Davis 1998: \u00a73.3; see even Grice\n1978: 53).\n\nMany have observed that the obvious falsity of what speakers say may\nsignal that they mean something else, but it does not tell us what\nelse they mean (e.g., Levinson 1983: 157\u20138; Lepore & Stone\n2015: 38\u20139). Indeed, metaphor is another case in which Grice\n(1975: 34) takes the speaker to be flouting Quality (Huang 2014:\n35\u20136).  So the flouting of Quality does not tell us which\nfigure of speech Don is using. He would have made a suitable\ncontribution to the conversation if he had been engaging in metaphor\ninstead of irony, meaning and believing that relations between he and\nhis partner (the \u201cweather\u201d in the cabin) are fine.\n\nMetaphors are often difficult to interpret. Suppose a commentator says\n\u201cIraq was Bush\u2019s Vietnam\u201d, referring to George W.\nBush and the second Gulf War. Did she mean that the U.S. lost in Iraq\nthe way it lost in Vietnam? That the reasons for going to war in Iraq\nwere as misguided as those that got the U.S. into Vietnam? Or did she\nperhaps mean that even though the U.S. did not secure all its\nobjectives, the Iraq war was still worth fighting? She could mean and\nbelieve any of these things and still be making a useful contribution.\nLepore & Stone (2015: Ch. 10) describe such metaphors as inviting\nhearers to imagine all the things the speaker might have meant. Grice\n(1975: 39\u201340) himself acknowledged such cases when he said\nthat\n\n\nthere may be many possible specific explanations \u2026 ; and if the\nlist of these is open, the implicatum will have just the kind of\nindeterminacy that many implicata do in fact\n have.[45]\n\n\nBut to say this is to deny Determinacy and\n Calculability.[46]\n\nSaul (2001, 2002, 2010) and M. S. Green (2002) suggested that\n\u201cimplicature\u201d be defined normatively, as\nproperly implicating something. W. Davis (2007a) replied that\nwhile determinacy is more plausible as a norm, similar considerations\nshow that it is not required even for properly meaning one thing by\nsaying something else. For example, a speaker who says \u201cI ate\nsome of the cookies\u201d could properly be meaning either \u201cI\nate them all\u201d (engaging in understatement), or \u201cI did not\neat them all\u201d (quantity implicature), or \u201cI do not know\nwhether I ate them all\u201d (ignorance implicature). None of these\ncontributions is required given that all would be appropriate.\n\nRysiew (2000: 577\u20138) suggested weakening the determinacy\ncondition by replacing \u201chas to believe (and implicate)\np\u201d with \u201cis likely to believe (and\nimplicate) p\u201d. As he notes, hearers commonly use\nabduction to figure out what speakers have implicated (cf. Hobbs et\nal. 1993; Geurts 2010: 34\u20135). Abduction is a specific form of\ninductive or non-demonstrative reasoning in which a hypothesis is\ninferred to be true from the fact that it provides the best\nexplanation of the data. By their nature, non-demonstrative methods\nare not guaranteed to succeed. This fact of life is no reason to shun\ninduction when seeking to discover implicatures. W. Davis (1998:\n66\u20138) had observed, though, that an implicature can exist and be\nconversational even though the available evidence does not make that\nimplicature (or belief) more likely than others. The problems of\nindeterminacy and overgeneration show, in particular, that the Gricean\nhypotheses provide neither the only nor the best explanations of the\ndata, making the inferences fallacious instances of abductive\nreasoning.\n10. Conflicting Principles\n\nGrice (1975: 30) recognized that his maxims may \u201cclash\u201d.\nWhen they do, there is no way to determine what is required for\nconformity to the Cooperative Principle. In the case of irony, for\nexample, Manner clashes with Quality. When Don said \u201cThe\nweather\u2019s lovely\u201d, we cannot interpret him as meaning what\nhe said because on that interpretation he would be violating Quality.\nBut we cannot interpret him as meaning the opposite because then he\nwould be violating Manner (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 18\u20139). It\nis more perspicuous to explicitly state something than to implicate\nit.\n\nWe use irony and other figures in part because we have conversational\ngoals other than the efficient communication of information (Lakoff\n1977; Sainsbury 1984: 427\u20139). We observe not only the\nCooperative Principle, but also the Principle of Style.\n\n\nPrinciple of Style: Be stylish, so be beautiful,\ndistinctive, entertaining, and interesting.\n\n\nClear and simple prose\u2014\u201cjust the facts,\nplease\u201d\u2014can be boring, tedious and dull. We liven up our\nwriting with figures of speech. Metaphor in particular makes speech\nmore interesting and insightful by engaging our imagination (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: Ch. 10). In the process, we sacrifice perspicuity\n(violating Manner). We sometimes \u201cembellish\u201d a narration\nto make it more interesting (violating Quality) and delete boring or\nugly details even when they are important (violating Quantity).\n\nThe Gricean maxims often clash with the Principle of Politeness,\nemphasized by Leech\n (1983).[47]\n\n\nPrinciple of Politeness: Be polite, so be tactful,\nrespectful, generous, praising, modest, deferential, and\nsympathetic.\n\n\nSpeakers frequently withhold information that would be offensive or\ndisappointing to the hearer, violating Quantity. Speakers often\nexaggerate in order to please or flatter, and utter \u201cwhite\nlies\u201d in order to spare the hearer\u2019s feelings, violating\nQuality. People pick \u201csafe topics\u201d (e.g., the weather) to\nstress agreement and communicate an interest in maintaining good\nrelations, violating Relation. Euphemisms avoid mentioning the\nunmentionable, but in the process violate Manner.\n\nOne common motive for implicating something is that it is often\nperceived to be more polite than asserting it (Pinker 2007; Huang\n2014: 142; Haugh 2015: 2). In case\n (1),\n Barb may have answered Alan\u2019s question indirectly because she\nthinks it is less likely to hurt his feelings, even if she realizes he\nwill assume that is what she is doing.\n\nBlome-Tillmann (2013a: 177) has suggested that problems such as\novergeneration and conflicting principles can be avoided by\nunderstanding calculability not as a way of predicting and explaining\nimplicatures, but merely as providing a criterion for them.  But\nif a criterion always gives false positives (overgeneration) or false\nnegatives (indeterminacy), or cannot be applied (due to clashes), then\nit is not a useful criterion.\n11. Neo-Gricean Pragmatics\n\nProminent linguists have sought to improve on Grice\u2019s\nformulation of the conversational principles, and provide a solution\nto the problem of clashes. Horn (2004: \u00a74) replaces Quantity,\nRelevance, and Manner with two interrelated\n principles.[48]\n\n\nQ Principle: Say as much as you can [given Quality\nand R].\n\nR Principle: Say no more than you must [given Q].\n\n\nLevinson (2000: 76, 114, 137) adopts similar principles, which he\ncalls \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cI\u201d (for\n \u201cInformativeness\u201d).[49]\n Since Horn believes that interpretations like [10a] are derivable\nfrom the R-principle, he calls them \u201cR-based\nimplicatures\u201d. The assumption is that there is no reason to make\na stronger statement (say more) if the extra information can be\ncontributed by implicature. Implicature [11b] is similarly described\nas \u201cQ-based\u201d. The assumption is that if the speaker did\nnot make a stronger statement (say more), its denial was\nimplicated.\n\n(10) \nHe broke a finger.\n\n a. He broke a finger of his own. (\u201cR-based implicature\u201d)\n b.  \u2717He did not break a finger of his own.\n\n\n\n\n(11) \nHe entered a house.\n\n a.\u2717 He entered his own house. \n b.  He did not enter his own house.  (\u201cQ-based implicature\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nHorn has clearly identified two distinct and very general patterns of\nmeaning and interpretation. Critics maintain, however, that\nHorn\u2019s two principles provide no reason to expect the two\nindicated interpretations rather than those we do not observe (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: \u00a73.1; W. Davis 2016: \u00a74.7). They ask how Q\ncan predict [11b] without predicting [10b], and how [10a] can be\nderivable from R if [11a] is not. What in R predicts [10a] rather than\nother strengthenings, such as \u201cHe broke someone else\u2019s\nfinger\u201d?\n [50]\n\nHorn goes on to formulate what he calls the Division of\nPragmatic Labor:\n\n\nGiven two expressions covering the same semantic ground, a relatively\nunmarked form\u2014briefer and/or more lexicalized\u2014tends to be\nR-associated with a particular unmarked, stereotypical meaning, use,\nor situation, while the use of the periphrastic or less lexicalized\nexpression, typically more complex or prolix, tends to be Q-restricted\nto those situations outside the stereotype, for which the unmarked\nexpression could not have been used appropriately. (Horn 2004: 16)\n\n\nHorn illustrates this division with the contrast between (12) and\n(13).\n\n(12) \nShe stopped the machine.\n\n a. She stopped the\nmachine in the usual way. (\u201cR-based implicature\u201d)\n b.  \u2717She did\nnot stop the machine in the usual way.\n\n\n\n\n(13) \nShe got the machine to stop\n\n a.\u2717 She stopped the machine in the usual way. \n b.  She did not stop the machine in the usual way.  (\u201cQ-based implicature\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nHorn appears to be assuming, plausibly, that \u201cstopped\u201d and\n\u201cgot to stop\u201d have the same meaning. If so, then it is\ndifficult to see how either implicature could be derived from Q or R,\nwhich refer to what is said, not how it is said.\n(Recall Grice\u2019s nondetachability criterion.) Levinson (2000:\n136\u20137) therefore reinstated a version of\n Manner.[51]\n\n\nM Principle: Indicate abnormal, nonstereotypical\nsituations by using marked expressions that contrast with those you\nwould use to describe the corresponding normal, stereotypical\nsituations.\n\n\nLevinson describes \u201cgot to stop\u201d as \u201cmarked\u201d\nbecause it is more complex and less lexicalized than\n\u201cstopped\u201d. W. Davis (2016: 160) notes, though, that when\nwe look at clear cases in which a single word is synonymous with a\nless lexicalized phrase, we often find no difference in implicature\n(e.g., mare versus adult female horse). And the word\noften connotes an unusually good example of the kind (e.g.,\nstallion in common parlance connotes an especially fast or\ndominant uncastrated adult male horse).\n\nHorn sometimes describes Q and R as \u201cantinomic forces\u201d\n(e.g., Horn 2004: 14), which would be appropriate if the bracketed\nconditions were omitted. Without the conditions, Horn\u2019s\nprinciples would clash as often as\n Grice\u2019s.[52]\n Without independent means of determining antecedently which force\nwill \u201cprevail\u201d in a given case, Horn\u2019s principles\nwould lack predictive or explanatory value. Lepore & Stone (2015:\n\u00a73.1) suggest treating Horn\u2019s principles as\n\u201csimultaneous equations\u201d, constraining but not determining\nthe conversational implicatures. But this assumes the equations have a\nsolution. Not all simultaneous equations do.\n\nLevinson (2000: 157\u201364) sought to avoid clashes by stating an\norder of precedence: Q > M > R. Huang (2014: 49) reverses the\nordering, saying that\n\n\nthe R-principle generally takes precedence until the use of a\ncontrastive linguistic form induces a Q-implicature to the\nnon-applicability of the pertinent R-implicature\u2026.\n\n\nSuch orderings make sense only if the bracketed clauses in Q and R are\nomitted. W. Davis (2016: 159) responds that Levinson\u2019s ordering\nmakes it is hard to see why\n (10)\n or\n (12)\n should have an R implicature rather than a Q implicature, while\nHuang\u2019s ordering makes it hard to explain why\n (11)\n and\n (13)\n have Q\n implicatures.[53]\n12. Relevance Theory\n\nThe most influential alternative to Gricean and neo-Gricean theory,\ncalled \u201cRelevance theory\u201d, was developed by Sperber and\n Wilson.[54]\n\n\nWe have proposed a definition of relevance and suggested what factors\nmight be involved in assessments of degrees of relevance. We have also\nargued that all Grice\u2019s maxims can be replaced by a single\nprinciple of relevance\u2014that the speaker tries to be as relevant\nas possible in the circumstances\u2014which, when suitably\nelaborated, can handle the full range of data that Grice\u2019s\nmaxims were designed to explain. (Wilson & Sperber 1986: 381)\n\n\n\u201cRelevance\u201d is given a highly technical sense, in which\nthe relevance of a proposition in a context is directly related to how\nmany positive cognitive effects it has and inversely related to how\nmuch effort is required to process it (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 6,\n62\u20133,\n 219).[55]\n \u201cPositive cognitive effects\u201d are \u201cimprovements in\nknowledge\u201d, including \u201ctrue contextual implications, or\nwarranted strengthenings or weakenings of existing assumptions\u201d.\nContextual implications are propositions logically implied by the\nproposition and the cognitive context together but from neither alone.\nPropositions or assumptions are objects of belief or\nknowledge\u2014cognitive representations. Wilson and Sperber\nillustrate their concept by imagining a doctor whose choice of true\nstatements is confined to the alternatives in (14).\n\n(14)\n \na. You are ill.\nb. You have the flu.\nc. You have the flu or 29 is the square root of 843.\n\n\n\nThey conclude that [14b] would be maximally relevant on the grounds\nthat it entails everything [14a] does and more, while being as easy to\nprocess; [14c] has the same cognitive effects as\n [14b],[56]\n but is harder to process.\n\nExample (14) is a special case in that either the effects or the\neffort are equal between alternative contributions. To know what is\nmaximally relevant in other cases, a particular function of effects\nand effort must be specified (Hinkelman 1987). Sperber and Wilson\nspecify one when describing the theory of cognition on which they\nground their theory of communication. \u201cOur claim is that all\nhuman beings automatically aim at the most efficient information\nprocessing possible\u201d (Sperber & Wilson 1986a: 49).\n\u201cEfficiency in cognition \u2026 involves processing inputs\nthat offer the best possible cost/benefit ratio at the\ntime\u201d(Wilson & Sperber 2012:\n 62).[57]\n Selecting this function and formulating a principle in the style of\nGrice\u2019s yields:\n\n\nPrinciple of Maximal Relevance (Cognitive\nEfficiency): Contribute that which has the maximum ratio of\npositive cognitive effects to processing\n cost.[58]\n\n\nWe will see that Relevance theorists qualify this idea, but many\nimportant points can be made with the simpler principle.\n\nWhile Grice\u2019s maxims enjoin the speaker to contribute the\nrequired information and do so perspicuously and briefly, they do not\nrequire the speaker to maximize information, perspicuity, or brevity\nwhen other things are equal. For example, Grice\u2019s maxims do not\npredict that Barb implicated I am not going anywhere in\n (1)\n even though it is more informative than I am not going to\nPeter\u2019s party, and may have a greater effects/cost ratio.\nOr suppose that in a discussion of a new prescription drug benefit,\nsomeone comments \u201cIt will take some money to fund that\nprogram\u201d. The speaker would normally be engaging in\nunderstatement, implicating \u201cThe program will be very\nexpensive\u201d. Relevance theorists account for this by saying that\nbecause the proposition explicitly conveyed is trivial, and thus has\nfew positive cognitive effects, the hearer will \u201crecover\u201d\nthe more informative\n proposition.[59]\n Critics respond that countless propositions are more informative than\nthe one implicated, such as \u201cThe program will cost\ntrillions\u201d, and seem as easy to process.\n [60]\n\nConversely, Maximal Relevance does not imply or subsume Grice\u2019s\nprinciples. For instance, nothing guarantees that the contribution\nwith the most positive cognitive effects per unit processing cost is\ngermane to the topic of the conversation or as informative as required\n(less informative contributions might have more positive cognitive\neffects per unit processing cost). As a result, Maximal Relevance does\nnot predict what Barb implicated in example\n (1).\n The proposition I am not going to Peter\u2019s party will\nhave different effects than I am not going to Paul\u2019s\nparty, but seems as easy to process and could well have as many\npositive cognitive\n effects.[61]\n Only the proposition about Paul is relevant in the ordinary sense to\nwhat Alan asked, but this does not entail that it is maximally\nrelevant in the technical sense of Relevance\n theory.[62]\n\nSperber and Wilson observe that Gricean theory provides no explanation\nfor why Don would say in\n (2)\n that the weather is lovely if he wanted to express the opposite\n belief.[63]\n Maximal Relevance has the same problem: Don\u2019s simply saying\nwhat he means would seem easier to process and thus more efficient.\nWilson & Sperber (2004: 621) think saying something in order to\nmean the opposite would be \u201cpatently irrational\u201d. Adler\n(1987: 710) observed, however, that it need not be irrational given\nhow readily hearers recognize when speakers do so. Moreover, speakers\nengaging in irony are doing more than meaning the opposite of what\nthey said. As Grice (1978: 53\u20134) later recognized, they are also\npretending to mean and assert what they\n said,[64]\n and are expressing more than disbelief of what is said. Sperber and\nWilson call it a \u201cdissociative attitude\u2014wry, skeptical,\nbitter, or\n mocking\u201d.[65]\n Hearers readily recognize and commonly enjoy the performance of this\ncomplex speech act. The observation that irony involves expressing a\ndissociative attitude does not lessen the theoretical problem,\nhowever. There is no reason to think, for example, that \u201cThe\nweather is terrible and anyone who thinks it lovely is foolish\u201d\nhas the maximum effects/cost ratio. Processing just what Don actually\nsaid (that the weather is lovely) would seem to require even less\neffort; so that proposition could conceivably have a greater\neffect/cost ratio. And there is no reason to think an ironic\ninterpretation has a greater effect/cost ratio than a hyperbolic or\nmeiotic interpretation. If expressing a dissociative attitude involves\nsomething other than expressing a proposition, as seems plausible (cf.\nM. S. Green 2018: \u00a75), it would not be a positive cognitive\neffect as defined, and thus would not affect the relevance ratio. For\nreasons such as these, Levinson (1989: 463\u20134) charged that the\naccounts offered by Relevance theorists are as ex post facto\nas Gricean accounts.\n\nThe explanations of loose use offered by Relevance theorists are\nproblematic in another way. In\n (8),\n where Mike said \u201cDinner will be at six\u201d, they explain why\nMike did not say something true like \u201cDinner will be at six or\nshortly after\u201d by saying that the strictly false statement has\nthe same positive cognitive effects but is easier to process and so\nmore\n relevant.[66]\n But that would erroneously imply that Mike did not mean and\nimplicate that dinner will be at six or shortly after.\nAnother reason the explanation is unsatisfactory is that there are\nother things Mike did not say with the same positive contextual\neffects that seem as easy to process as \u201cDinner will be\nat six\u201d. including \u201cDinner will be\naround six\u201d. This proposition has some true cognitive\neffects that \u201cDinner will be at six\u201d lacks, including\n\u201cDinner may not be exactly at six\u201d.\n\nThe recital example in\n \u00a710\n illustrates one reason why Relevance theories adopt Optimal rather\nthan Maximal Relevance (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 64\u20135):\n\n\nthe communicator is manifestly limited by her own abilities (to\nprovide appropriate information, and to present it in the most\nefficient way). Nor can she be expected to go against her own\npreferences (e.g., against the goal she wants to achieve in\ncommunicating, or the rules of etiquette she wishes to follow).\n\n\nHowever:\n\n\nSince it is also manifest that the audience will tend to pay\nappropriate attention only to an utterance that seems relevant enough,\nit is manifest that the communicator wants her audience to assume that\nthe utterance is indeed relevant enough. There is thus a minimal level\nof relevance that the audience is encouraged to expect: the utterance\nshould be relevant enough to be worth the effort needed for\ncomprehension.\n\nRelevance theorists thus propose that every utterance conveys a\npresumption of its own optimal relevance, defined by (a) and (b):\n\n\nPresumption of Optimal Relevance:\n  \na.\nThe utterance is relevant enough to be worth processing.\nb.\nIt is the most relevant one compatible with the\ncommunicator\u2019s abilities and\n preferences.[67]\n \n\n\nBecause of its preference provision, Optimal Relevance does not clash\nwith Politeness and Style the way Maximal Relevance does. The parents\nmay say \u201cYour performance wasn\u2019t perfect\u201d rather\nthan \u201cIt was horrendous\u201d because they strongly prefer not\nto hurt their daughter\u2019s\n feelings.[68]\n This means, however, that Optimal Relevance would not predict that\nBarb meant I am not going to Paul\u2019s party in\n (1)\n even if it is relevant enough to process and more relevant than the\nother alternatives. For Barb might have preferred to dodge\nAlan\u2019s question. In\n (2),\n Don may have preferred an ironic utterance to ones with higher E/C\nratios (Millikan 1987: 725).\n\nWe are focusing on Relevance theory as an alternative attempt to\npredict and explain what speakers implicate. The main focus of\nRelevance theorists, however, is the process by which hearers\ninterpret utterances. The hearer\u2019s aim, on their view,\nis \u201cto find an interpretation of the speaker\u2019s meaning\nthat satisfies the presumption of optimal relevance\u201d. They infer\nthat the hearer \u201cshould follow a path of least effort, and stop\nat the first overall interpretation that satisfies his expectations of\nrelevance\u201d (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 7). It is unclear how to\nreconcile this with requirement that the optimally relevant utterance\nbe the most relevant one compatible with the communicator\u2019s\nabilities and preferences.\n\nThe ratio of positive cognitive effects to processing cost is zero\nwhen there are no positive cognitive effects at all. Given the\ndefinition of contextual implication, any proposition that is part of\nthe cognitive context has no contextual implications. So both Maximal\nand Optimal Relevance seem to imply that speakers cannot mean or\nimplicate anything already known, and must mean something else. Gerrig\n(1987: 718) and McCawley (1987: 724) find this implausible. If A and B\nare walking in torrential rain, A might well say \u201cIt is raining\nreally hard\u201d, stating the obvious, and B might respond\n\u201cThere is indeed some rain coming down\u201d, engaging in\nunderstatement and implicating exactly what A said.\n\nMany critics have observed, and Sperber and Wilson have acknowledged,\nthat relevance as defined is not\n measurable.[69]\n Positive cognitive effects are non-denumerable. Anything a speaker\nmight say or implicate will have infinitely many true contextual\nimplications if it has\n any.[70]\n We do not know whether processing cost is measured by time, mental\neffort, electro-chemical energy, inferential steps, or some function\nof them all. We have no unit of measurement for mental effort, and do\nnot yet know how to measure the energy consumed in processing an\nutterance. If relevance is not well defined and knowable, it cannot be\nused to account for specific implicatures.\n13. Explicature and Impliciture\n\nAs observed in\n \u00a71,\n Grice (1975: 24) introduced the technical term\n\u201cimplicature\u201d to denote either (i) the act of meaning or\nimplying one thing by saying something else, or (ii) what the speaker\nmeant or implied. Grice (1975: 87ff) used \u201csay\u201d quite\nstrictly, requiring what a speaker says to be closely related to what\nthe sentence uttered means on that occasion. Indexicals provide cases\nin which what a speaker says is not what the sentence used means. When\nBarb uttered \u201cI have to work\u201d in\n (1),\n she said that she, Barb, has to work; but the sentence she used does\nnot mean \u201cShe, Barb, has to work\u201d even on that occasion.\nEllipsis allows people to say things without even uttering sentences.\nIf John asks \u201cWhere did Mary go?\u201d and Sue answers\n\u201cTo the gym\u201d, then Sue said that Mary went to the gym. The\ninfinitive phrase she uttered was elliptical for a sentence meaning\n\u201cMary went to the gym\u201d but does not itself mean that.\n\nSperber and Wilson (1986a: 182\u20133) introduced the parallel term\nexplicature to mean what is \u201cexplicitly\ncommunicated\u201d. Carston (1988: 33) initially identified this with\n\u201cwhat is said, in Grice\u2019s\n terms\u201d.[71]\n On this definition, Barb\u2019s explicature in\n (1)\n was that she has to work, and her implicature was that she is not\ngoing to Paul\u2019s party. Carston\u2019s (1988: 40)\nparadigm case is less clear.\n\n(15) \nAlice ran to the edge of the cliff.\n\na. Alice jumped.\nb. Alice jumped off the cliff.\n\n\n\n\nAfter saying or observing that Alice ran to the edge of the cliff, a\nspeaker would typically use (15a) \u201cAlice jumped\u201d to mean\nthat Alice jumped off the cliff [15b]. Carston counts this an\nexplicature. It does resemble ellipsis, but a speaker who used (15a)\nto mean that Alice jumped up to the rescue helicopter said the\nsame thing while meaning something different. And if the speaker\nknew that Alice jumped up to safety, the speaker might be accused of\nmisleading the hearer but not of lying.\n\nCarston\u2019s (1988: 45; 2004a: 646\u20138) most influential\nargument is based on what are commonly called \u201cembedded\nimplicatures\u201d. She would claim that if \u201cAlice jumped off\nthe cliff\u201d were an implicature of \u201cAlice jumped\u201d,\nthen we should not understand (16a) and (16b) as having the same truth\nconditions. Yet we do, Carston believes. The alleged implicature seems\nto fall within the scope of the logical operator. Yet it cannot given\nthe definition of implicature\n (\u00a71).[72]\n\n(16) \n\n\n a. If Alice ran to the edge of the cliff and jumped, she is probably dead. \n b.   If Alice ran to the edge of the cliff and jumped off, she is probably dead.\n\n\n\n\nW. Davis (2016: \u00a75.3) replies as follows. A speaker who used\n (15a)\n to mean\n [15b]\n would just as naturally use (16a) to mean [16b], and hearers would\nunderstand the speaker accordingly. But what the speaker said\nis not entailed by [16b]. What the speaker of (16a) said would be\nfalse in circumstances in which Alice was unlikely to jump off the\ncliff if she jumped. Hearers would focus on what the speaker meant,\nthough, which would be true even in those circumstances. Since the\nspeaker meant one thing [16b] by saying something else [16a], the\nspeaker implicates [16b]. The speaker cannot implicate anything by\nuttering the antecedent of (16a) because the speaker does not say\nanything by uttering the antecedent, only by uttering the whole\nconditional. So there is really no embedding of implicatures when\n(16a) is uttered.\n\nThe relationship between\n (15)\n and (16) is special. In many other cases in which a sentence\n\u201cp\u201d conversationally implicates\n\u201cq\u201d, the conditional \u201cIf p then\nr\u201d does not implicate \u201cIf p and\nq then r\u201d. For example, If Bill got some\nproblems wrong, he might have gotten them all wrong does not\nimplicate \u201cIf Bill got some but not all problems wrong, he might\nhave gotten them all wrong\u201d.\n\nA lively debate between Relevance theorists and neo-Griceans concerns\nnumerical claims.\n\n(17) \nPeter has one child.\n\n a.Peter has at least one child. \n b.  Peter has exactly one child.\n\n\n\n\nAll parties agree that a speaker can use (17) to mean either [17a] or\n[17b]. Horn (1972) and Levinson (2000: 87\u201390) further agree with\nCarston that (17) itself is unambiguous. But whereas the neo-Griceans\nhold that (17) means [17a] rather than [17b], Carston (1988:\n46\u20137) maintains that (17) means neither but can be used to say\nboth. So the neo-Griceans hold that (17) always says [17a] while\nsometimes implicating [17b]. Carston holds that (17) is sometimes used\nto explicate [17a] and sometimes [17b]; neither is an implicature. The\nthesis that sentence meaning leaves open what is said to this extent\nis called semantic underdetermination.\n\nWhile still doubting that Carston\u2019s view can fully account for\ncardinals, Horn (1989: 250\u20131; 2010: 314\u20135) now concludes\nthat they do not behave like quantifiers. For example, if you know\nthat everyone passed, you must answer \u201cDid some students\npass?\u201d with \u201cYes\u201d. But if you know that Peter has\ntwo children, you cannot answer \u201cDoes Peter have one\nchild?\u201d without knowing whether the speaker meant \u201cat\nleast\u201d or \u201cexactly\u201d. Indeed, a case can be made that\n(17) is ambiguous, so that Neo-Gricean and Relevance accounts are both\nwrong (W. Davis 2016: \u00a77.3).\n\nFollowing Sperber & Wilson (1986a: 182), Carston (2004b: 635)\nlater defines an explicature as a development of a logical form\nencoded by the sentence uttered, and an implicature as any proposition\ncommunicated by an utterance that is not an\n explicature.[73]\n The technical terms \u201cdevelopment\u201d and \u201clogical\nform\u201d are understood in such a way that [15b] is a development\nof [15a]. Thus understood, \u201cexplicature\u201d covers much more\nthan what is said, and \u201cimplicature\u201d covers much less than\nwhat is implicated as defined in\n \u00a71.\n\nBach (1994: 160) uses \u201csay\u201d even more strictly than Grice,\nmeaning \u201cstrictly, literally, and explicitly\nsay\u201d. Since the speaker of\n (15a)\n did not explicitly say\n[15b],\n Bach counts \u201cThe speaker said that Alice jumped off the\ncliff\u201d as false. Bach (1994: 125\u20136, 140\u20131; 2006:\n28\u20139) agrees with Carston, though, in withholding the term\n\u201cimplicature\u201d when what the speaker means is an\n\u201cexpansion\u201d or \u201ccompletion\u201d of what is said.\nBach introduces the term impliciture (with \u201ci\u201d\nrather than \u201ca\u201d after soft \u201cc\u201d) to cover such\ncases. Bach restricts \u201cimplicature\u201d to cases in which what\nis meant is \u201ccompletely separate\u201d from what is said.\n\nA thesis attributed to Grice is that what S says is\ndetermined by \u201cdecoding\u201d, while what S\nconversationally implicates is determined by what S says\ntogether with an inferential, pragmatic mechanism (see, e.g., Sperber\n& Wilson 1986a: 182). An alleged problem, called\n\u201cGrice\u2019s Circle\u201d (Levinson 2000: 173\u20134,\n186\u20137), is that many of the processes involved in figuring out\nwhat is said, such as reference identification and ambiguity\nresolution, \u201cinvolve exactly those inferential mechanisms that\ncharacterize Gricean\n pragmatics\u201d.[74]\n Grice never talked about decoding however, and observed himself that\nconversational principles are involved in determining what is said\n(Grice 1957: 222). For example, if an ambiguous term is used, we\nnaturally assume\u2014in the absence of specific\ncounterevidence\u2014that the intended meaning is the one relevant to\nthe conversation. In a discussion of snow, \u201cThere is a large\nbank on Main Street\u201d is naturally interpreted as referring to a\nsnow bank.\n\nThere is no circle on Grice\u2019s view because what is said is the\nconclusion of one pragmatic inference, and is one of the premises in a\nfurther pragmatic inference to what is\n implicated.[75]\n The process is serial rather than parallel, although later\nconclusions may always lead to adjustment of earlier conclusions.\n14. Speaker Implicature and Intention\n\nW. Davis (2016: Ch. 2) describes ways of explaining and inferring\nconversational implicatures that do not rely on conversational\nprinciples. The methods he proposes for speaker implicature are\ndescribed in this section and for sentence implicature in the\nnext.\n\nFor a speaker to implicate something is for the speaker to mean\nsomething by saying something else\n (\u00a71).\n It is generally agreed that what a speaker means is determined by the\nspeaker\u2019s intentions. When Steve utters \u201cKathryn\nis a Russian teacher\u201d, whether Steve means that Kathryn is a\nteacher of Russian nationality or a teacher of the Russian language,\nand whether he is speaking literally or ironically, depends entirely\non what Steve intends to convey. What \u201cconvey\u201d means\nprecisely is controversial, but is an independent\n issue.[76]\n\nWe most commonly explain why people do A with the intention\nof doing B by explaining why they believe they will do\nB by doing A, or why they want to do B. We\ncan explain why speakers intend to convey a thought by uttering a\nsentence that says something else in the same ways. Why do speakers\nbelieve they can convey thoughts by means of the various figures and\nmodes of speech identified in\n \u00a74?\n One reason is that they have seen others doing so. Knowledge of the\ncommon forms of implicature is acquired along with knowledge of the\nsemantics and syntax of our native language. Speakers pick up figures\nand modes of speech from other speakers, as they learn vocabulary and\ngrammar. After speakers have become proficient, their own past success\nin using figures and modes of speech is a reason for them to believe\nthey will succeed again. Knowledge of both figures and modes is as\ntacit as our knowledge of syntax and semantics. It is not knowledge of\nfacts that define a language, but of how a language is used and\nunderstood. Since the figures and modes do not depend on a particular\nlanguage, they can be used with any language.\n\nWhy do speakers want to engage in implicature? The main reasons are\nthe reasons speakers make statements: to communicate, express\nthemselves, and record their thoughts. These goals may serve to\ncooperate with others, or to oppose them. What goals are served by\nimplicating rather than saying something? One is verbal efficiency\n(Levinson 2000: 28\u201331; Camp 2006: 3; Wilson & Sperber 2012:\n62): through implicature we express two or more thoughts by uttering\njust one sentence. Another is to mislead without lying (Horn 2010:\n\u00a74; 2017; Zufferey et al. 2019: 77\u201384). People often wish others\nto believe things that are false, and not only in situations of\nconflict and competition. And they nearly always prefer misleading to\n lying.[77]\n The greater deniability of implicature, and the fact that it enables\nus to veil our intentions, are often motivating factors (Brown &\nLevinson 1978: 137; Pinker 2007; Camp 2022). We observed in\n \u00a710\n how implicature promotes the goals of style and politeness.\n\nIt should also be recognized that people perform many even highly\nskilled actions automatically, spontaneously, or habitually. Such\nactions are done without deliberation or conscious planning. What\nspeakers implicate as well as what they say commonly falls in this\ncategory.\n\nGiven that speaker meaning is a matter of speaker intention, it\nfollows that speaker implicatures can be recognized or predicted by\nthe methods we use to infer intentions from behavior, including\nabduction, analogy, and testimony. In example\n (2),\n Carla may suspect that Don means the weather is bad because irony is\na common linguistic device\n (\u00a74),\n and Don has been ironic in similar situations before. Don\u2019s\nintonation may be a clue. On the other hand, if Don rarely speaks\nfiguratively when reporting in, Carla may infer that he meant what he\n said.[78]\n\nConversational principles can play the same indirect role in\nimplicature recognition that known tendencies or goals play in\ninductive inference generally. Since speakers commonly observe the\nCooperative Principle, and hearers know this in a vague and tacit sort\nof way, hearers tend to assume that particular speakers are\ncooperating, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. If the\nhypothesis that Barb means she is not going to Paul\u2019s party in\n example (1)\n fits better with the assumption that she is being cooperative than\nthe hypothesis that she is not answering the question, Alan may by\nabduction infer she is implicating that. Further support for the\nhypothesis may be provided by the recollection that other speakers\nhave implicated similar things in similar circumstances before. The\nfact that relevance implicature is a common practice thus provides\nanalogical evidence\n (\u00a74).\n Recognition of an unconventional form of implicature is more\ndifficult, but no harder than recognizing when a speaker is using a\nsentence with an unconventional meaning. As Sterelny (1982:\n192\u20133) observed, knowledge of the particular speaker is\nultimately more important than knowledge of non-universal\ngeneralizations.\n\nWhen S is being uncooperative, we have to use other\ngeneralizations or analogies. We are familiar with the ways defendants\nmanipulate language in an effort to avoid self-incrimination.\n15. Sentence Implicature and Convention\n\nWhereas what a speaker implicates depends on the particular\nspeaker\u2019s intentions, what a sentence implicates on\nDavis\u2019s theory depends on the conventions of the community of\nspeakers who use the language. To know or explain sentence\nimplicatures is to know or explain the relevant conventions. This is\nas true of generalized conversational implicatures as it is of\nimplicatures that are conventional in Grice\u2019s sense\n(\u00a72).\n\nWhen Grice talked about conventional implicatures he was referring to\nsemantic implicatures, like [3c]. These exist because of\nconventions that give individual words or syntactic structures their\nmeanings. The queen is English and therefore brave implicates\n\u201cBeing brave follows from being English\u201d because it is\nconventional for English speakers to use \u201ctherefore\u201d with\na certain meaning, which determines the implicature. A\nconversational sentence implicature is not determined by the\nmeaning of the sentence used, even when sentences with the same form\nare conventionally used with that implicature. It is a second-order\nconvention: a convention to use a sentence of a given form with an\nimplicature that is not part of its meaning. The common modes and\nfigures of speech are also second-order conventions, but not\nrestricted to sentences with a particular form. A language is defined\nby first-order lexical and syntactic conventions, not by second-order\nimplicature conventions. In this respect conversational implicature\nconventions are like naming conventions, word formation rules,\nintonation rules, speech act rituals (e.g., saying \u201cThis is\nN\u201d when answering a telephone), and indirect speech act\nconventions (e.g., asking \u201cCan I get an N?\u201d to\nrequest an\n N).[79]\n Second-order conventions are not as arbitrary, though, because there\nis always some antecedent relation between what the sentence means and\nthe implicature that makes it natural to use one to convey the other.\nImplicature conventions promote style, politeness, and efficiency as\nwell as communication.\n\nLike other second-order linguistic conventions, conversational\nimplicature conventions differ in their cross-linguistic spread.\nWhereas the quantity implicature of \u201csome\u201d has been found\nin all observed languages (Horn 1989), common metaphors differ as much\nfrom language to language as the idioms that evolve from them do. The\nfact that regularities in implicature obtain cross-linguistically is\ncompatible with their being arbitrary and conventional. Witness the\npractice of using \u201c?\u201d and rising intonation to mark\nquestions. Why some implicatures are common to more languages than\nothers is an open question on any view. To the extent that\nimplicatures are conventional, it is a question for historical\nlinguistics.\n\nKnowledge of sentence implicatures is a crucial component of\nlinguistic\n competence.[80]\n Speakers unaware of them are likely to mislead their audience.\nImagine the possibilities if an oblivious speaker said Your\nhusband saw a woman to the subject\u2019s wife. Hearers without\nsuch knowledge are likely to either misinterpret or fail to fully\nunderstand the speaker. Sentence implicatures, both semantic and\nconversational, resemble idioms and figures of speech in being picked\nup by native speakers from other speakers in the course of learning\nthe language. Sentence implicatures thus perpetuate themselves from\none generation to the next as sentence meanings do. Recent metaphors\nare special in being picked up by adults, and are liable to become\nidioms if they pass on to new generations.\n\nAn impressive body of research has attempted to discern general\nregularities in the multitude of conversational implicature\nconventions associated with a language. Wierzbicka (2003) has studied\nhow implicature conventions reflect broader \u201ccultural\nscripts\u201d. Others study how the implicatures of a sentence are\nrelated to the implicatures of compound sentences in which the\nsentence is embedded (Gazdar 1979; Levinson 2000: \u00a72.5.1;\nSauerland & Stateva 2007)\u2014the question raised by example\n (16).\n\nThe most influential work on conversational implicature conventions\ndescribes \u201cHorn\n scales\u201d.[81]\n Horn (1972, 1989) observed that the quantifiers all, most, many,\nsome form a scale with the following properties. Instances of\n\u201c___ S are P\u201d with one term entail\ninstances with any term to the right, but not to the left; the terms\nare thus ordered by logical strength. Moreover, the result of\nsubstituting one term implicates the denial of the result of\nsubstituting any term to the left, but not to the right. In the\nnegative context \u201cIt is not the case that ___ S are\nP\u201d, the logical and pragmatic relations are reversed.\nOther Horn scales are \u27e8necessarily, actually,\npossibly\u27e9, \u27e8certainly, probably,\npossibly\u27e9, and \u27e8must, should, may\u27e9. Horn\n(1989: \u00a74.5) correlates the existence of scales with the absence\nof certain lexical items, such as a quantifier meaning \u201cnot\n all\u201d.[82]\n Levinson (2000: 156) looked for a generalization that would cover\nthese cases but not scales like \u27e8Over 90%, over 10%,\nsome\u27e9 which have the same logical relations as Horn scales\nbut not the pragmatic relations. One generalization is that the items\non a Horn scale are widely and frequently used monolexemes. A\ncompanion problem is to explain why some common monolexemes with\nsimilar logical relations lack the pragmatic relations, as\nseveral illustrates. Given the conventional nature of\ngeneralized conversational implicatures, there may be no systematic\n(\u201csynchronic\u201d) explanation. All languages are\n\u201cirregular\u201d to some extent. For example, the regular\npattern for adjectives in English is that of tall, taller,\ntallest. But there are exceptions, such as good, better,\nbest. No one expects that anything other than a historical\n(\u201cdiachronic\u201d) explanation exists for these facts.\n\nThe literature on implicature is enormous and still growing. This\nentry, regrettably, had to ignore many valuable contributions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abbott, Barbara, 2006, \u201cWhere Have Some of the\nPresuppositions Gone?\u201d, in Birner &amp; Ward 2006:\n1\u201320.", "Adler, Jonathan E., 1987, \u201cComparisons with Grice\u201d,\n<em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em>, 10(4): 710\u2013711.\ndoi:10.1017/S0140525X00055357", "Allott, Nicholas, 2018, \u201cConversational Implicature\u201d,\nin <em>Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics</em>, Mark Aronoff\n(ed.), accessed 19 August 2019, Oxford: Oxford University Press.\ndoi:10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.205", "Alston, William P., 2000, <em>Illocutionary Acts and Sentence\nMeaning</em>, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.", "Anttila, Raimo, 1989, <em>Historical and Comparative\nLinguistics</em>, Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins\nPublishing.", "Asher, Nicholas &amp; Lascarides, Alex, 2013, \u201cStrategic\nconversation\u201d, Semantics and Pragmatics, 6, 1\u201362.  doi:\n10.3765/sp.6.", "Atlas, Jay David, 1979, \u201cHow Linguistics Matters to\nPhilosophy: Presupposition, Truth, and Meaning\u201d, in Oh &amp;\nDinneen 1979: 265\u2013281.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1989, <em>Philosophy Without\nAmbiguity</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Atlas, Jay David and Stephen Levinson, 1981, \u201cIt-Clefts,\nInformativeness, and Logical Form: Radical Pragmatics (Revised\nStandard Version)\u201d, in Cole 1981: 1\u201361.", "Austin, John L., 1962, <em>How to Do Things with Words</em>,\nCambridge: Harvard University Press.", "Bach, Kent, 1987, <em>Thought and Reference</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1994, \u201cConversational\nImpliciture\u201d, <em>Mind &amp; Language</em>, 9(2): 124\u2013162.\ndoi:10.1111/j.1468-0017.1994.tb00220.x", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1995, \u201cStandardization vs.\nConventionalization\u201d, <em>Linguistics and Philosophy</em>,\n18(6): 677\u2013686. doi:10.1007/BF00983302", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1999, \u201cThe Myth of Conventional\nImplicature\u201d, <em>Linguistics and Philosophy</em>, 22(4):\n327\u2013366. doi:10.1023/A:1005466020243", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006, \u201cThe Top 10 Misconceptions\nAbout Implicature\u201d, in Birner &amp; Ward 2006: 21\u201330.", "Bach, Kent and Robert M.
