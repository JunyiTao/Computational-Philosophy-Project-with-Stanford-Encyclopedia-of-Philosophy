    "main_text": "Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity || Explaining Normativity via Motivation\n4.1 Explaining Normativity via Motivation\n\nOne familiar view is that normative thought has a special, internal,\nconnection to motivation. According to motivational judgment\ninternalism (MJI), it is a necessary truth that a person who believes\nshe ought to do something is motivated accordingly. Generalizing,\nperhaps all normative thoughts are such that, necessarily, a person\nwith a normative thought is thereby motivated accordingly. This\nconnection to motivation arguably must be due to the content of\nnormative beliefs, since not all beliefs have such a close connection\nto motivation. And this suggests an account of normativity. It would\nsay, roughly, that normative propositions are such because,\nnecessarily, anyone who believes such a proposition is motivated\naccordingly.\n\nA different view would invoke the neo-Humean view that no belief\n(properly so called) entails or necessitates motivation; beliefs\nmotivate only when combined with an appropriately related desire. On\nthis view, if moral judgments entail motivation, then moral judgments\nare not (ordinary) beliefs, properly so-called. They must instead be\nat least partly constituted by conative states that do necessarily\nmotivate. In this way, MJI can lead to non-cognitive expressivism.\n\nThe expressivist, Allan Gibbard, has proposed, for example, that\nnormative states of mind are planning states, akin to intentions. To\njudge that it does not make sense to have another Dr. Pepper consists\nin something like planning not to have another Dr. Pepper. Gibbard has\ndeveloped a systematic and sophisticated account to put flesh on this\nbasic idea (Gibbard 2003).\n\nUnfortunately, MJI is controversial and there are a variety of\ncounter-examples and arguments against it (Brink 1989; Copp 2007: chap\n8; Svavarsd\u00f3ttir 1999; for relevant discussion, see entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external).\n Accordingly, defenders of the basic intuition have qualified and\namended MJI. Michael Smith contends, for example, that it is a\nnecessary truth that a person who believes she ought to do something\nis motivated accordingly unless she is practically irrational (1994).\nHe has also proposed a naturalistic account of what it is to be\npractically rational. His approach lends support to a form of\nnaturalistic normative realism rather than to a form of\nexpressivism.\n",
