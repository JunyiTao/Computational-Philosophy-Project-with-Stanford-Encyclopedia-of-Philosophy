    "main_text": "Atomism in Nineteenth-Century Physics || Phenomena Connected Via Atomism\n5.3 Phenomena Connected Via Atomism\n\n\nDuring the half-century that followed the emergence of unique chemical\nformulae and viable versions of the kinetic theory around 1860 the\ncontent of atomism was clarified and extended and the case for it\nimproved by the development of atomic explanations of experimental\neffects that involved connections between phenomena of a variety of\nkinds, the behaviour of gases, the effect of solutes on solutions,\nosmotic pressure, crystallography and optical rotation, properties of\nthin films, spectra and so on. In several of these cases atomic\nexplanations were offered of experimental connections for which there\nwere no available alternative explanations so that the case for\natomism understood as an inference to the best explanation was\nstrengthened.\n\n\nStereo-chemistry emerged as a result of taking the structures depicted\nin chemical formulae of substances to be indicative of actual\nstructures in the molecules of those substances. Pairs of substances\nthat had crystal structures that were mirror images of each other but\nwhich were otherwise chemically identical were represented by formulae\nthat were themselves mirror images of each other. Optical rotation\ngave independent evidence for the reality of these underlying\nstructures.  Some chemists were reluctant to assert that the\nstructures were in fact depictions of the physical arrangements of\natoms in space, a stand supported by the fact that there was still no\ntheory that connected physical arrangements of atoms with physical and\nchemical properties.  There were eminent scientists, notably Ostwald\n(1904) and Duhem (2002), who, whilst accepting that the phenomena were\nindicative of some underlying structure, refused to make the further\nassumption that the formulae with their structures referred to\narrangements of atoms at all. Two factors provide a rationale for\ntheir stance. Firstly, the use of formulae in chemistry could be\naccepted without committing to atomism, as we have discussed above,\nand as both Ostwald and Duhem stressed. Secondly, an analogy with\nelectromagnetism indicates that structural features need not be\nindicative of underlying physical arrangements accounting for those\nstructures. The electric field has the symmetry of an arrow and the\nmagnetic field the symmetry of a spinning disc, but there is no known\nunderlying physical mechanism that accounts for these\nsymmetries. Stereo-chemistry may not have provided a case for atomism\nthat was logically compelling, but it certainly enabled that case to\nbe strengthened.\n\n\nAnother set of phenomena providing opportunities to develop atomism\ninvolved the effects of solutes on solutions. It was discovered that\neffects such as the depression of freezing point and vapour pressure\nand the elevation of boiling point of a solvent brought about by\ndissolving a non-electrolytic solute in it are proportional to the\nweight of dissolved substance and, what is more, that the relative\neffects of differing solutes in a given solvent were determined by the\nmolecular weight of the solute. More specifically, the magnitude of\nthe various physical effects of a solute was dependent on the number\nof gram molecules of the dissolved solute, independent of the chemical\nnature of the solute. This provided a way of measuring the molecular\nweight of soluble substances that complimented the method involving\nthe measurement of the vapour pressure of volatile ones. The strong\nsuggestion that these effects depended on the number of molecules per\nunit volume was strengthened when it was discovered that the osmotic\npressure of a solute in a solvent obeys the gas laws. That is, the\nosmotic pressure exerted by a solute in a definite volume of solvent,\nmeasurable as the pressure exerted on a membrane permeable to the\nsolvent but not the solute, was exactly the same as if that same\namount of solute were to fill that same volume as a gas.\n\n\nWhile the above could readily be explained by atomism, an anti-atomist\ncould still accept the experimental correlations by interpreting\nmolecular weights as those yielded by chemical formulae independently\nof an atomic interpretation. Ostwald took that course.  The move\nbecame less plausible once the phenomena were extended to include\nsolutions of non-electrolytes. For electrolytes, physical phenomena\nsuch as modification of boiling and freezing points and osmotic\npressure could be explained in terms of the concentration of ions\nrather than molecules, where the ions were the charged atoms or\ncomplexes of atoms employed by the atomists to explain electrolysis.\nThis enabled new experimental connections to be forged between, for\nexample, osmotic pressure, and the conductivity of electrolytes. What\nis more, the charges that needed to be attributed to ions to explain\nelectrolysis were themselves linked to the valencies of the chemists.\nThe atomic interpretation of electrolysis required a corresponding\natomistic interpretation of electric charge, with each monovalent ion\ncarrying a single unit of charge, a bi-valent ion carrying two such\nunits and so on.\n\n\nYet another breeding ground for atomism came in the wake of the\nelectromagnetic theory of light (1865) and the experimental production\nof electromagnetic radiation by an electric oscillator (1888).\nHelmholtz (1881) observed that optical dispersion could be readily\nexplained if it were assumed that the transmission of light through a\nmedium involved the oscillation of particles that were both massive\nand charged. The adsorption and emission of spectra characteristic of\natoms also suggested that they were due to the oscillations of charged\nparticles on the atomic or sub-atomic scale. These assumptions in\nconjunction with the kinetic theory of gases led to an explanation of\nthe width of spectral lines as a Doppler shift due to the velocity of\nradiating molecule, making possible estimates of the velocities of\nmolecules that were in agreement with those deduced from the diffusion\nrate of gases.\n\n\nStrong evidence for the charged and massive particles assumed in an\natomic explanation of electrolysis and radiation was provided by the\nexperiments on cathode rays performed by J. J. Thomson (1897). The\nexperimental facts involving cathode rays could be explained on the\nassumption that they were beams of charged particles each with the same\nvalue for the ratio of their charge to their mass. Thomson\u2019s\nexperiments enabled that ratio to be measured. A range of other\nexperiments in the ensuing few years, especially by Milliken, enabled\nthe charge on the cathode particles, electrons, to be estimated, and\nthis led to a mass of the electron very much smaller than that of\natoms. The fact that identical electrons were emitted from cathodes of\na range of materials under a range of conditions strongly suggested\nthat the electron is a fundamental constituent of all atoms.\n",
