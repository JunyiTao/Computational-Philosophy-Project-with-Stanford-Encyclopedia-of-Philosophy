    "main_text": "Experimental psychology: object and method || Method\n3.2 Method\n\nNevertheless, Wundt repeatedly addresses the objections raised against\nthe very possibility of psychological, as opposed to physiological or\npsychophysical, experimentation. How are we to subject the mind-body\ncomplex to physiological stimulation such that the reactions may be\ngiven a purely psychological interpretation? From the physiological\npoint of view, experimentation with stimulus and response are not\nexperiments of sensation, but of externally observable excitations and\nreactions of nerve and muscle tissue. For example, a nerve fiber or a\nskin surface may be given an electric shock or brought into contact\nwith acid, and twitches of muscle fiber are observed to follow. It is\nobvious, especially when the nerve-tissue in question belongs to a\ndead frog (Wundt describes such an experiment in PP), that\nthese experiments say nothing about the \u201cinner\u201d experience\nor consciousness of sensation. Wundt\u2019s innovation is the attempt\nto project the experimental rigor of physiology into the domain of\ninner experience by supplementing these experiments with a\npurely psychological set of procedures. These procedures\nconstitute Wundt\u2019s well-known yet misunderstood method of\nSelbstbeobachtung, i.e. \u201cintrospection\u201d or,\nbetter, \u201cself-observation\u201d.\n\nBecause \u201cinner\u201d distinguishes itself from\n\u201cexternal\u201d experience by virtue of its immediacy, all\npsychology must begin with self-observation, so that physiological\nexperiment is given an ancillary function (Boring 1950: 320\u201321).\nNow Wundt is well aware of the common criticism that self-observation\nseems inescapably to involve the paradoxical identity (described in\nthe previous section) of the observing subject and observed object.\nIndeed, he takes pains to distinguish his notion of self-observation\nfrom that of \u201cmost advocates of the so-called empirical\npsychology\u201d, which he calls \u201ca fount of self-delusions\n[Selbstt\u00e4uschungen]\u201d:\n\n\nSince in this case the observing subject coincides with the observed\nobject, it is obvious that the direction of attention upon these\nphenomena alters them. Now since our consciousness has less room for\nmany simultaneous activities the more intense these activities are,\nthe alteration in question as a rule consists in this: the phenomena\nthat one wishes to observe are altogether suppressed [i.e., by the\nactivity of focused attention upon them]. (L III: 162)\n\n\nWundt believes that one can experimentally correct for this problem\nby\n\n\nusing, as much as possible, unexpected processes, processes not\nintentionally adduced, but rather such as involuntarily present\nthemselves [sich darbieten]. (L III:\n 162)[19]\n\n\nIn other words, it is in the controlled conditions of a laboratory\nthat one can, by means of experimenter, experimental subject, and\nvarious apparatus, arbitrarily and repeatedly call forth precisely\npredetermined phenomena of consciousness. The psychologist is\nnot then interested in the psychophysical connections between\nthe somatic or nervous sense-mechanisms and the elicited\n\u201cinner\u201d phenomena, but solely in describing, \u201cand\nwhere possible measuring\u201d, the psychological\nregularities that such experiments can reveal, viz., regular causal\nlinks within the domain of the psychic alone (L III: 165).\nAccording to Wundt, psychological experiments thus conceived\naccomplish in the realm of consciousness precisely what\nnatural-scientific experiments do in nature: they do not leave\nconsciousness to itself, but force it to answer the\nexperimenter\u2019s questions, by placing it under regulated\nconditions. Only in this way is\n\n\na [psychological] observation [as opposed to a mere\nperception {Wahrnehmung}] at all possible in the scientific\nsense, i.e., the attentive, regulated pursuit of the phenomena.\n(L III:\n 165)[20]\n\n\nA detailed account of these experiments themselves, however, lies far\nbeyond the scope of this\n article.[21]\n\n",
