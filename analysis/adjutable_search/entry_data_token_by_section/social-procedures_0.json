    "main_text": "Social Procedures as Algorithms\n1. Social Procedures as Algorithms\n\nSocial software cannot be seen as a clearly defined research field on\nits own, but rather an umbrella for certain types of research in\ncomputer science, logic, and game theory. Nevertheless, the social\nsoftware perspective on social procedures and intelligent interaction,\nemphasizing algorithms and information, has already produced a wide\nvariety of important insights. In this article, a number of examples\nwill be discussed and pointers will be given to related discussions in\nphilosophy.\n\nThe prototypical example of an algorithm in\nmathematics (see also entry on\n computability and complexity)\n is Euclid\u2019s recipe for finding the greatest common divisor\n(GCD) of two positive whole numbers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The GCD of two\nnumbers is the greatest number that divides both numbers without\nresidue.\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) is larger than \\(B\\), then replace \\(A\\) by \\(A - B\\),\notherwise, if \\(B\\) is larger than \\(A\\), replace \\(B\\) by \\(B - A\\).\nContinue like this until \\(A\\) equals \\(B\\).\n\n\nThe final \\(A = B\\) yields the greatest common divisor of the numbers\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that you started with. For instance, suppose you start\nthe algorithm with \\(A = 20\\), \\(B = 12\\). Then in the first step,\n\\(A\\) gets replaced by \\(20 - 12 = 8\\), so \\(8\\) becomes the new\n\\(A\\). In the second step, \\(B\\) gets replaced by \\(12 - 8 = 4\\), so\n\\(4\\) becomes the new \\(B\\). In the third step, \\(A\\) gets replaced by\n\\(8 - 4 = 4\\), so \\(4\\) becomes the new \\(A\\) and the two numbers\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have become equal. The algorithm yields \\(4\\) as the\nGCD of \\(20\\) and \\(12\\).\n\nEuclid\u2019s recipe is formal, and we can\nanalyze it with formal means. The correctness of Euclid\u2019s\nalgorithm follows from the insight that if you have two numbers \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) with \\(A\\) larger than \\(B\\), and you replace \\(A\\) by \\(A -\nB\\), then the set of common divisors of the number pair does not\nchange.\n\nAlgorithms come in many forms and flavors, for example, sequential and\nparallel ones. For interesting introductions to algorithms in computer\nscience, see Harel & Feldman (2004) and Miller & Boxer (2012).\nIn a similar manner as these algorithms, social procedures can be\nanalyzed with the formal tools of logic and theoretical computer\n science.[2]\n\nIt appears that most amenable to a formal approach are those social\nprocedures for which one wants to guarantee that given certain\nstarting conditions, the procedure preserves or creates specific\ndesired properties. Examples are social procedures for fair division\n(Section\n 2),\n matching (Section\n 3),\n communication (Section\n 4).\n Finally, the formal perspective is useful for situations requiring\nparticipants\u2019 strategic reasoning (Section\n 5).\n A common element is that in all these situations, agents\u2019\nknowledge and lack of knowledge of other agents\u2019 mental states\nplay an important role. As a counterpart to the examples in the\ncurrent article, Van Benthem (2018) provides an intriguing overview\nabout the current roles of social perspectives in computer science\nitself, highlighting social agency and information. \n",
