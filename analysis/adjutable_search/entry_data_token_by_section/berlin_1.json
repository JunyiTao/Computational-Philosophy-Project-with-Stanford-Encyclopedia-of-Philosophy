    "main_text": "Life || Intellectual Development\n1.1 Intellectual Development\n\nAn early influence on Berlin was a waning British Idealism, as\nexpounded by T. H. Green, Bernard Bosanquet and F. H. Bradley. While\nan undergraduate, Berlin was converted to the Realism of G. E. Moore\nand John Cook Wilson. By the time he began teaching philosophy he had\njoined a new generation of rebellious empiricists, some of whom (most\nnotably A. J. Ayer) embraced the logical positivist doctrines of the\nVienna Circle and Wittgenstein\u2019s earlier writings. Although\nBerlin was always sceptical towards logical positivism, its suspicion\nof metaphysical claims and its preoccupation with the nature and\nauthority of knowledge strongly influenced his early philosophical\nenquiries. These, combined with his historical bent, led him back to\nthe study of earlier British empiricists, particularly Berkeley and\nHume, on whom he lectured in the 1930s and late 1940s, and about whom\nhe contemplated writing books (which never materialised).\n\nBerlin was also influenced by Kant and his successors. His first\nphilosophical mentor was an obscure Russian Jewish Menshevik\n\u00e9migr\u00e9 named Solomon Rachmilevich, who had studied\nphilosophy at several German universities, and who introduced Berlin\nto the great ideological quarrels of Russian history, as well as to\nthe history of German philosophy since Kant. Later, at Oxford, R. G.\nCollingwood fostered Berlin\u2019s interest in the history of ideas,\nintroducing him in particular to such founders of historicism as\nGiambattista Vico and J. G. Herder. Collingwood also reinforced\nBerlin\u2019s belief \u2013 heavily influenced by Kant \u2013 in\nthe importance to human life of the basic concepts and categories in\nterms of which human beings organise and analyse their experience (see\nfurther 2.1 and note 2).\n\nWhile working on his biography of Marx in the mid 1930s, Berlin came\nacross the works of two Russian thinkers who would be important\ninfluences on his political and historical outlook. One of these was\nAlexander Herzen, who became a hero, and to whom Berlin would\nsometimes attribute many of his own beliefs about history, politics\nand ethics. The other was the Russian Marxist publicist and historian\nof philosophy G. V. Plekhanov. Despite his opposition to Marxism,\nBerlin admired and praised Plekhanov both as a man and as a historian\nof ideas. It was initially by reading Plekhanov\u2019s writings that\nBerlin became interested in the naturalistic, empiricist and\nmaterialist thinkers of the Enlightenment, as well as their Idealist\nand historicist critics. Both Herzen and Plekhanov fuelled\nBerlin\u2019s absorption in the political debates of nineteenth- and\nearly twentieth-century Russian liberals and radicals of various\nstripes, which in turn informed his concern with both the philosophy\nof history and the ethics of political action.\n\nDuring the Second World War, separated from his Oxford philosophical\nbrethren, and exposed to political action, Berlin began to drift away\nfrom his early philosophical concerns. His doubts were encouraged by a\nmeeting with the Harvard logician H. M. Sheffer, who asserted that\ngenuine increase in knowledge was possible only in such hybrid\nsubfields of philosophy as logic and psychology. His meeting with\nSheffer led Berlin to realise that he lacked the passion and the\nbelief in his own ability to continue pursuing pure philosophy. He\nconcluded that as a professional philosopher (as he then understood\nthat role) he would make no original contributions, and would end his\nlife knowing no more than he did when he began. He therefore\ndetermined to switch to the history of ideas, in which (he believed)\noriginality was less essential, and which would allow him to learn\nmore than he already knew. Berlin\u2019s approach to the history of\nideas would, however, remain deeply informed by his philosophical\npersona, as well as by his political beliefs. His historical work was,\nin effect, the practice of philosophy in a historical key.\n\nBy the early 1950s Berlin\u2019s central beliefs had crystallised\nfrom the confluence of his philosophical preoccupations, historical\nstudies, and political and moral commitments and anxieties; and his\nmajor ideas were either already fully formed, or developing. Such\nessays of the late 1950s as Two Concepts of Liberty served as\nthe occasion for a synthesis and solidification of his thoughts.\nBerlin had always been a liberal; but from the early 1950s the defence\nof liberalism became central to his intellectual concerns. This\ndefence was, characteristically, closely related to his moral beliefs\nand to his preoccupation with the nature and role of values in human\nlife. In the early 1960s Berlin\u2019s focus moved from the more\npolitical concerns that occupied him in the 1950s to an examination of\nthe nature of the humanities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s he was\nworking on the history of ideas, and from the mid 1960s nearly all of\nhis writings took the form of essays in this field, particularly on\nthe Romantic and reactionary critics of the Enlightenment. In the\nfinal decades of his life Berlin continued to refine and re-articulate\nhis ideas, and particularly his formulation of pluralism; but his\ncourse was set, and he appears to have been little affected by later\nintellectual developments.\n",
