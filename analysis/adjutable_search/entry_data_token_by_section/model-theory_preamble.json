    "main_text": "\n\nModel theory began with the study of formal languages and their\ninterpretations, and of the kinds of classification that a particular\nformal language can make. Mainstream model theory is now a\nsophisticated branch of mathematics (see the entry on\n first-order model theory).\n But in a broader sense, model theory is the study of the\ninterpretation of any language, formal or natural, by means of\nset-theoretic structures, with Alfred Tarski\u2019s\n truth definition\n as a paradigm. In this broader sense, model theory meets philosophy\nat several points, for example in the theory of logical consequence\nand in the semantics of natural languages. \n",
