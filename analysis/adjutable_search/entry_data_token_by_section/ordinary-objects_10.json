    "main_text": "Against Revisionary Ontologies || Arguments from Counterexamples\n3.1 Arguments from Counterexamples\n\nUniversalism seems to conflict with our intuitive judgment that the\nfront halves of trout and the back halves of turkeys do not compose\nanything. Put another way, universalism seems to be open to fairly\nobvious counterexamples. Here is an argument from counterexamples\nagainst universalism:\n\n(CX1)\nIf universalism is true, then there are trout-turkeys.\n(CX2)\n There are no trout-turkeys.\n(CX3)\n So universalism is false.\n\n\nSimilar arguments may be lodged against other revisionary theses. The\nvarious forms of eliminativism wrongly imply that there are no\nstatues; plenitudinism wrongly implies that there are incars; the\ndoctrine of arbitrary undetached parts wrongly implies that there are\nleg complements; and so\n forth.[55]\n\nCompatibilist accounts of the apparent counterexamples take the\ntargeted revisionary views to be entirely compatible with the\nintuitions or beliefs that are meant to motivate CX2. Such accounts\noften take the form of assimilating recalcitrant ordinary utterances\nto some familiar linguistic phenomenon that is known to be potentially\nmisleading. For instance, when an ordinary speaker looks in the fridge\nand says \u2018there\u2019s no beer\u2019, she obviously\ndoesn\u2019t mean to be saying that there is no beer anywhere in the\nuniverse. Rather, she is tacitly restricting her quantifier to things\nthat are in the fridge. Universalists often suggest that something\nsimilar is going on when ordinary speakers say \u2018there are no\ntrout-turkeys\u2019 (or \u2018there\u2019s nothing that has both\nfins and feathers\u2019). Speakers are tacitly restricting their\nquantifiers to ordinary objects, and what they are saying is entirely\ncompatible with there being non-ordinary finned-and-feathered\nthings like trout-turkeys. Universalists may then hold that the\nargument from counterexamples rests on an equivocation. If the\nquantifiers are meant to be restricted to ordinary objects, then CX2\nis true, but CX1 is false: universalism does not entail that any\nordinary things are trout-turkeys. If on the other hand the\nquantifiers are meant to be entirely unrestricted then CX2 is false;\nbut in denying CX2 (so understood), one is not running afoul of\nanything we are inclined to say or believe or\n intuit.[56]\n\n\nThis is just one of many compatibilist strategies that have been\ndeployed in defense of revisionary views. Universalists have also\ninvoked an ambiguity in \u2018object\u2019 to explain the appeal of\n\u2018there is no object that has both fins and feathers\u2019.\nEliminativists have claimed that ordinary utterances of \u2018there\nare statues\u2019 are instances of \u201cloose talk\u201d, or that\nthey are context-sensitive, or that quantifiers are being used in a\nspecial technical sense in the \u201contology\n room\u201d.[57]\n\nOne common complaint about compatibilist accounts is that these\nproposals about what we are saying and what we believe are\nlinguistically or psychologically implausible. For instance, when\nordinary speakers are speaking loosely or restricting their\nquantifiers, they will typically balk when their remarks are taken at\nface value. (\u201cThere\u2019s no beer anywhere in the\nworld?\u201d) But this sort of evidence seems just to be missing in\nthe cases at hand. (\u201cYou think there literally are\nstatues?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all with both\nfins and feathers?\u201d) Others have criticized compatibilist\nstrategies by pointing to limitations of their recipes for\nparaphrasing ordinary utterances. For instance, Uzquiano (2004:\n434\u2013435) argues that the standard eliminativist strategy of\nparaphrasing constructions of the form \u2018there are Fs\u2019 in\nterms of there being atoms arranged Fwise cannot be adapted to handle\nconstructions like \u2018some Fs are touching each\n other\u2019.[58]\n\n\nRevisionaries may instead wish to give incompatibilist accounts of the\nputative counterexamples, conceding that the revisionary views they\ndefend are incompatible with ordinary belief (ordinary discourse,\ncommon sense, intuition, etc.), but maintaining that the mistakes can\nbe explained or excused. For instance, revisionaries may contend that\nthe mistaken beliefs are nevertheless justified, so long as one is not\naware of the defeaters that undercut our usual justification (e.g.,\nthose mentioned in\n \u00a72.6).\n Or they may contend that ordinary speakers are not especially\ncommitted to these beliefs, which may in turn suggest that they do not\ndeserve to be treated as data for purposes of philosophical inquiry.\nOr they may call attention to some respect in which the ordinary\nutterances and beliefs are \u201cnearly as good as\n true\u201d.[59]\n\n",
