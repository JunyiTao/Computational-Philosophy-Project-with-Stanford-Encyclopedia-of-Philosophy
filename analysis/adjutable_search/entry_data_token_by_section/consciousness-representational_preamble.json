    "main_text": "\n\nThe idea of representation has been central in discussions of\nintentionality for many years. But only more recently has it begun\nplaying a wider role in the philosophy of mind, particularly in\ntheories of consciousness. Indeed, there are now multiple\nrepresentational theories of consciousness, corresponding to different\nuses of the term \u201cconscious,\u201d each attempting to explain\nthe corresponding phenomenon in terms of representation. More\ncautiously, each theory attempts to explain its target phenomenon in\nterms of intentionality, and assumes that intentionality is\nrepresentation.\n\nAn intentional state represents an object, real or unreal (say, Mage\nor Pegasus), and typically represents a whole state of affairs, one\nwhich may or may not actually obtain (say, that Mage wins the Kentucky\nDerby again in 2024). Like public, social cases of representation such\nas writing or mapmaking, intentional states such as beliefs have\ntruth-value; they entail or imply other beliefs; they are (it seems)\ncomposed of concepts and depend for their truth on a match between\ntheir internal structures and the way the world is; and so it is\nnatural to regard their aboutness as a matter of mental referring or\ndesignation. Sellars (1956, 1967) and Fodor (1975) argue that\nintentional states are states of a subject that have semantical\nproperties, and the existent-or-nonexistent states of affairs that are\ntheir objects are just representational contents.\n\nSo much is familiar and not very controversial. But problems of\nconsciousness are generally felt to be less tractable than matters of\nintentionality. The aim of a representationalist theory of\nconsciousness is to extend the treatment of intentionality to that of\nconsciousness, showing that if intentionality is well understood in\nrepresentational terms, then so can be the phenomena of consciousness\nin whichever sense of that fraught term.\n\nThe notions of consciousness most commonly addressed by philosophers\nare the following: (1) \u201cConscious states\u201d in the very\nspecific sense of: states whose subjects are directly, internally\naware of them. (2) Introspection and one\u2019s privileged access to\nthe internal character of one\u2019s experience itself. (3) Being in\na sensory state that has a distinctive qualitative property, such as\nthe color one experiences in having a visual experience, or the timbre\nof a heard sound. (4) The phenomenal matter of \u201cwhat it\u2019s\nlike\u201d for the subject to be in a particular mental state,\nespecially what it is like for that subject to experience a particular\nqualitative property as in (3). Block (1995) and others have used\n\u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d for sense (4), without\ndistinguishing it from sense (3). (A further terminological\ncomplication is that some theorists, such as Dretske (1995) and Tye\n(1995), have used the expression \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to\nmean the qualitative property itself, rather than the present\nhigher-order property of that property. This entry will mainly use\n\u201cqualitative\u201d to allude to sensory qualities of the sort\nthat figure in (3), and \u201cphenomenal\u201d as applying to\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like.\u201d)\n\nFor each of the four foregoing notions of consciousness, some\nphilosophers have claimed that that type of consciousness is entirely\nor largely explicable as a kind of representing. This entry will deal\nmainly with representational theories of consciousness in senses (3)\nand (4). The leading representational approaches to (1) and (2) are\n\u201chigher-order representation\u201d theories, which divide into\n\u201cinner sense\u201d or \u201chigher-order perception\u201d\nviews, \u201cacquaintance\u201d accounts, and \u201chigher-order\nthought\u201d theories. For discussion of those, see the entry on\n higher-order theories of consciousness.\n",
