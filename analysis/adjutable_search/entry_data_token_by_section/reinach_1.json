    "main_text": "Reinach's Realist Phenomenology\n2. Reinach's Realist Phenomenology\n\n\nLike the other realist phenomenologists, Reinach saw himself as\ndeveloping a distinctive approach to philosophy, inspired by\nHusserl's Logical Investigations, with the goal of being\nfaithful to what is given in different kinds of experience (e.g.,\nlinguistic, religious, moral, or aesthetic experience).\n\n\nFor realist phenomenologists, the distinction between a\npriori and a posteriori knowledge has to do with the kind\nof object studied and not (as for the later Husserl) with any special\nepistemological technique such as that of epoch\u00e9 or\ntranscendental reduction. Reinach credited the possibility of a\npriori knowledge to certain special features (necessity,\nuniversality, timelessness, intelligibility) of the corresponding\nobjects of knowledge (which are in Reinach's eyes certain kinds\nof states of affairs and associated essences or natures). Thus, Reinach\nwrites\n\n\nWe can surely take it as generally granted that there are no\nself-evident and necessary relations of essence in the causal\nrelations of external events. However it is, to speak with Hume, that\nwe come to know that fire produces smoke, this is surely not\nintelligibly grounded in the essence of fire, as it lies in the\nessence of the number 3 to be larger than the number 2. (1913, p.\n15, emphasis added)\n\n\nReinach saw these special features of certain essences\u2014such as\nnumbers, promising, and asserting\u2014as straightforward features of\nreality, thereby insisting that calling something a priori\n\u201cdoes not mean anything dark or mystical\u201d (1913, p. 5). His\nrealist understanding of material and synthetic a priori\nknowledge of essences is further elucidated in the next two\nsections.\n\n\nAccording to Reinach, material a priori states of affairs\nand essences exist independently of the contingent minds that may\napprehend them and of the individual objects that may instantiate them.\nSuch instantiation will however bring in its wake a series of concrete\nassociations with other entities. Thus in writing about the legal\nentities (such as rights and obligations) that are grounded in the\nessence of promising, Reinach notes that when such legal entities\nexist, they become \u201cintimately interwoven with the rest of the\nnatural world, with all the experiencing of persons who perform acts,\nwith their feelings and wishes, their desires and intentions, their\nexpectations and fears, etc.\u201d (1913, p. 130)\n\n\nReinach's insistence that the objects of a priori\nknowledge can be considered apart from any realization in the world led\nto Husserl's later accusation that Reinach embraced a Platonism\nthat \u201cdistorted the true picture of phenomenology\u201d\n(Spiegelberg, p. 192). Yet Reinach explicitly rejected any notion of\nessences of the sort that would generate any form of third man\nargument. In his article, \u201cThe Supreme Rules of Rational\nInference According to Kant\u201d (1911a), he observes that\njudgments such as \u201cthe triangle has three sides\u201d or\n\u201cthe lion has a tail\u201d have often been said to refer to\ngeneral concepts such as \u201ctriangle\u201d or \u201clion.\u201d\nBut this leads not only to odd ideas (e.g., that a concept has a tail)\nbut also, as Berkeley noted, to impossible ideas (such as a triangle\nthat is at once right-angled, equilateral, and obtuse). Reinach notes\nthat the ontological mistake lies in assuming that essences are\nsubstances or really existing particulars; the logical mistake is\nassuming that judgments about \u201cthe triangle\u201d or \u201cthe\nlion\u201d refer to concepts at all. Rather, the judgment that\n\u201cthe triangle has three sides\u201d is more precisely expressed\nas having the general form \u201ceverything that is a triangle has\nthree sides.\u201d It is this general state of affairs that is the\nspecific object of our a priori knowledge.\n",
