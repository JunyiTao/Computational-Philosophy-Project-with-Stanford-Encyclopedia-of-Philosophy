    "main_text": "Methodology and Philosophical Framework || Postmetaphysical Thinking\n5.2 Postmetaphysical Thinking\n\nPostmetaphysical thinking, Habermas\u2019s paradigm for modern\nphilosophy, must be understood through contrast with its predecessor,\nmetaphysics. He labels much of the history of Western philosophy as\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d, counting Parmenides, Plato, Plotinus,\nAugustin, Aquinas, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Hegel as metaphysical\nthinkers (1988b essay 2 [1992a: 12\u201313]; 1988b essay 3 [1992a:\n29]). He sometimes distinguishes between metaphysics proper and the\n\u201cphilosophy of consciousness\u201d or \u201cphilosophy of the\nsubject\u201d associated with the rationalism of Descartes and the\nidealism of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 31];\n1988b essay 8 [1992a:, 158\u201362]), though it is not clear whether\nthis should be considered a separate paradigm (1988b essay 2 [1992a:\n12\u201313]) or simply a late stage of metaphysics.\n\nAmong the characteristics of metaphysics are:\n\nA conception of philosophy as the queen of the sciences,\nwith its own unique method and form of knowledge, distinct from the\nnatural and social sciences, which can yield special insights into the\nnature of reality and the meaning of life. Plato\u2019s theory of\nforms is an excellent example of this, since Plato thinks that\nphilosophy, with its dialectical method, can offer true knowledge\n(episteme) of the forms, superior to mere opinion\n(doxa) about the material world.\nA substantive conception of reason as an Archimedean\npoint from which the philosopher can observe reality as a whole.\nThe metaphysical philosopher\u2019s goal is to attain an\nobserver\u2019s perspective on reality, from which they can learn\nuniversal and necessary truths. Philosophy can thus act as the judge\nand arbiter of both science and culture (1983 [1990: 2\u20133]).\nIdealism and identity thinking (1988b essay 3 [1992a:\n29\u201331]). Metaphysics assumes that ideas are primary and the\nmaterial world secondary, and that to grasp the underlying\nintellectual reality is to grasp the whole: \u201cthe structures of\nbeing themselves are what is laid hold of in knowledge\u201d (1988b\nessay 2 [1992a: 13). Again, Plato\u2019s theory of forms is a prime\nexample.\nFor philosophy of consciousness, the use of strong\ntranscendental arguments to ground claims about the nature of\nreality on the individual subject\u2019s self-knowledge. Habermas\nthinks that this turn to introspective self-knowledge as foundational\ntook place as a result of the pressure which natural science was\nputting on metaphysics by the eighteenth century. It may no longer be\nplausible that the individual subject can grasp \u201cthe structures\nof being themselves\u201d in thought, but they can at least grasp the\nstructure of their own thoughts, and build on these foundations some\ncertainty about the world. Kant\u2019s transcendental unity of\napperception (1988b essay 7 [1992a: 124\u20135]) and refutation of\nidealism in the First Critique are the clearest examples.\n\n\nHabermas concedes that this is a stipulative definition of\nmetaphysical philosophy, focused on idealism. Ancient materialism and\nscepticism, medieval nominalism, and modern empiricism do not fit the\nmould, but Habermas argues that they should be seen as\n\u201cantimetaphysical countermovements\u201d within the horizon of\nmetaphysics (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 29]). He often characterises modern\nphilosophical trends of which he is critical as covertly metaphysical.\nHabermas sees some trends as attempted breaks with metaphysics which\nremain trapped within the paradigm (Nietzsche, Heidegger,\nDerrida\u20141981 [1987: 83\u2013105, 131\u2013160,\n161\u2013184]), others as still being mired in the philosophy of\nconsciousness (Niklas Luhmann\u2019s systems theory\u20141981 [1987:\n368\u2013385]), and other again as deliberate attempts to return to\nthe philosophy of consciousness (Dieter Henrich\u2014 1988b essay 2\n[1992a: 10\u201327]).\n\nPostmetaphysical thinking begins with the first generation of\npost-Hegelian thinkers (Feuerbach, Marx, Kierkegaard) (1988b essay 3\n[1992a: 39]), and includes pragmatists such as C.S. Peirce and G.H.\nMead, speech-act theorists such as J.L. Austin and John Searle, the\nlater Wittgenstein, and Karl-Otto Apel.\n\nAmong the characteristics of postmetaphysical thinking are:\n\n\n\nRational reconstruction as a method (1988b essay 3 [1998b:\n38]). Since rational reconstruction is also used by many of the social\nsciences, philosophy is no longer seen as unique in its method and\nform of knowledge, but simply as one discipline among others.\nPostmetaphysical philosophy has no priority over the natural and\nsocial sciences, but neither is it subordinate to them. It opposes\nscientism, the idea that the natural sciences have unique authority\nand privileged access to the truth. \n\n\nA \u201cweak but not defeatistic (sic) concept of\nlinguistically embodied reason\u201d (1988b essay 7 [1992a: 142]).\nPostmetaphysical philosophy conceives of reason as being historically,\nsocially, and linguistically situated, embedded in the intersubjective\ncommunicative processes of the lifeworld, rather than transcending\nthem. The philosopher is a participant in these processes, not an\noutside observer. Postmetaphysical reason is immanent in the\ncommunicative practices of the lifeworld, and procedural (1988b essay\n3 [1992a: 34\u20135]), rather than being the external Archimedean\npoint of metaphysics. Habermas thus sees postmetaphysical thinking as\nhaving a detranscendentalized conception of reason. \n\n\nThe use of weak transcendental arguments, rather than the\nstrong transcendental arguments of metaphysics (Yates 2011:\n41\u20134). Benhabib defines strong transcendental arguments as ones\nwhich aim to\n\n\n(prove) the necessity and singularity of certain conditions without\nwhich some aspect of our world, conduct, and consciousness\ncould not be what it is.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 cogito and Kant\u2019s refutation of\nidealism are examples, aiming to prove the existence of the subject\nand of the external world. Weak transcendental arguments, in contrast,\nfocus on lifeworld practices such as communicative action, moral\ndiscourse, and democratic deliberation (rather than experience as\nsuch), and\n\n\ndemonstrate more modestly that certain conditions need to be fulfilled\nfor us to judge those practices to be of a certain sort rather than of\na different kind. (Benhabib 2002: 38)\n\n\nUnlike strong transcendental arguments, weak transcendental arguments\nare both a posteriori, since they are based on rationally\nreconstructed experience, and falsifiable, since they can be refuted\nby further empirical experience (1976b [1998b: 42]). \n\n\nThe ability to provide context-transcending validity, despite\nabandoning metaphysical philosophy\u2019s search for universal\nnecessary truths. Validity claims are the clearest example (1988b\nessay 7 [1992a: 142]; 1983 [1990: 19, 203]). Although they are always\nadvanced from within a particular lifeworld context, they hold that a\ncertain thing is morally right for the intersubjective world, or true\nfor the objective world, as a whole. The claims raised are not just\nvalid within the context of the interlocutors raising them, but for\nall speaking and acting subjects, as they must be if postmetaphysical\nphilosophy is to critique existing social and political conditions\n(1988b essay 3 [1992a: 50]). Habermas speaks in this context of the\n\u201cimmanent transcendence\u201d or \u201ctranscendence from\nwithin\u201d of language (2005c). \n\n\nModesty with regard to ethical and ontological claims (Rees\n2018: 55\u20136, 60\u20132). Although it can clarify the procedures\nof moral discourse, it should refrain from making substantive\ncontributions to ethical discourse (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 50]; 1988d\n[1990a chapter 5, 211]). Unlike metaphysical philosophy, it refrains\nfrom making ontological claims about matters such as the existence of\nGod. In accordance with the postsecular orientation of\nHabermas\u2019s recent work, postmetaphysical philosophy remains\nagnostic about such matters, while being open to the truth-contents of\nreligious language. \n\n\nThe metaphysical philosopher is an isolated figure, aiming through the\nuse of their individual reason to attain a neutral observer\u2019s\nperspective on reality as a whole and produce knowledge of universal,\nnecessary truths. The postmetaphysical philosopher, in contrast, aims\nat a participant\u2019s perspective, working in dialogue with the\nnatural and social sciences and making use of a situated, procedural\nconception of reason. There is no transcendent Archimedean point for\nthe philosopher to occupy, since we are all embedded in our lifeworlds\nand our thinking conditioned by social, historical, and linguistic\nfactors. What remains distinctive about philosophy as a discipline is\nthat it can step back from the particular questions which the natural\nand social sciences focus on and produce general knowledge about the\nhuman condition; but this knowledge is now based on empirical data and\nrational reconstructions, and as such is contestable and revisable.\nPostmetaphysical philosophy no longer claims to be the role of judge\nand usher of science and culture, assigning each discipline and\ncultural practice to its proper place. Instead it acts as a\nplaceholder for fruitful collaborations between empirical research and\nphilosophical ideas, and as an interpreter mediating between the\nrationalized value-spheres of science, law, and art and the everyday\ndiscourse of the lifeworld (1983 [1990: 15\u20139]).\n",
