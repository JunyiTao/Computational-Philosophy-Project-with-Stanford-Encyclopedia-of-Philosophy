    "main_text": "The Clarke Collins Correspondence (1707\u201308) || Background: Consciousness and Material Systems\n2.1 Background: Consciousness and Material Systems\n\nThe chief topic of the Clarke Collins controversy of 1707\u201308 is\nwhether consciousness can inhere in a material system, a highly\ncontroversial issue largely inspired in this case by Locke\u2019s\nnotorious speculation about thinking matter. In Book IV of An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding, in stressing the limits of\nhuman knowledge of substances, Locke writes: \n\n\nWe have the Ideas of Matter and Thinking, but possibly shall never be\nable to know, whether any mere material Being thinks, or no; it being\nimpossible for us, by the contemplation of our own Ideas, without\nrevelation, to discover whether Omnipotency has not given to some\nSystem of Matter fitly disposed, a power to perceive and think, or\nelse joined and fixed to Matter so disposed, a thinking immaterial\nSubstance\u2026. (Locke 1690 IV, iii, 6 [1975: 540\u20131]) \n\n\nLocke then went on to conjecture that it might be just as easy for God\nto add the power of thought to a system of matter organized in the\nright way as for God to connect an immaterial thinking thing to a body\n(Ibid.). Clearly, the difficulties in explaining how an immaterial\nmind could relate to a material body play a significant role in\nleading Locke to this position. This \u201cthinking matter\u201d\npassage \u201craised a storm of protest and discussion that lasted\nright through to the last years of the eighteenth century\u201d\n(Yolton 1983: 17). One of the first of these protests came from Bishop\nStillingfleet and Locke\u2019s response helps us better understand\nthe thinking matter hypothesis. Starting with God\u2019s creation of\nmatter, Locke goes through a series of superadditions of motion to\nmatter, life and the excellencies of vegetation such as those of a\nrose or a peach tree, then sense and spontaneous motion and the other\nproperties of an elephant. Then he notes that if there are no\nobjections to God performing these actions upon matter, why object to\nthe next step which is superadding the powers to matter to make a\nthinking, intelligent material thing. Thus, superaddition seems to\ninvolve the creation of organizations out of matter that have\nparticular functional powers characteristic of different kinds of\nliving things.\n\nLocke and Collins discussed some of the responses to the thinking\nmatter passage that were published before Locke\u2019s death in 1704.\nLocke\u2019s conjecture about thinking matter is, in effect, the\ncenterpiece of the debate between Samuel Clarke and Anthony Collins\nbetween 1707 and 1708, although the issue was also discussed on the\ncontinent. Still, as Ann Thompson writes in Bodies of\nThought: \n\n\nHere I shall only observe that despite the undeniable importance of\nLocke\u2019s hypothesis and the arguments put forward in his second\nreply to Stillingfleet, they should not be seen as a starting point\nfor speculations about the soul, but as part of an ongoing\nphilosophical and theological discussion. While Locke\u2019s\narguments probably provided a new stimulus for discussion, claims that\nhis hypothesis constituted the sole impetus for the late seventeenth\ncentury materialistic works ignore the preceding theological debates.\n(Thompson 2008: 58) \n\n\nThere were some diverse strands to this debate.\n\nThe Catholic Church at the Fifth Lateran Council in 1553 had declared\nthe soul immaterial and therefore immortal. Philosophers were invited\nto produce proof of the soul\u2019s immateriality. There was a\ntradition going back to Plato that the soul is a unity without parts.\nPresumably having no parts it cannot fall apart. The kind of substance\ndualism that one finds in Descartes, for example, was intended to\ndistinguish humans from animals. In England, the new science was both\nregarded suspiciously by some religious conservatives while its\nproponents saw it as an ally of religion. In his will, Robert Boyle\nprovided for a series of lectures that would use the new science to\ndefend religious orthodoxy. These Boyle lectures were aimed at\ndefending religion against atheists, deists, Epicurean philosophers,\nas well as Hobbes, Spinoza, and their followers. One of Richard\nBently\u2019s sermons in 1692 was titled Matter and Motion Cannot\nThink. Bently claimed that even God\u2019s omnipotence could not\nproduce a cognitive body (Thompson 2008: 61). This claim that there\nwas a limit to God\u2019s omnipotence was shocking to some. Samuel\nClarke gave the Boyle lecture two years in a row, 1704 and 1705, and\nthese were published together as A Discourse Concerning the Being\nand Attributes of God and the Obligations of Natural Religion and the\nTruth and Certainty of the Christian Revelation. It is quite\nlikely that Collins had read this work and so when he opposed Clarke,\nhe surely knew who and what philosophical positions he was dealing\nwith.\n\nOn the other side, the mechanical philosophy of Descartes, Mersenne\nand Gassendi played a role on the materialist side of the debate.\nInsofar as animals could be treated like machines, it became possible\nfor one to argue that humans were sufficiently like other animals that\nthey too could be treated as machines. Thus an immaterial soul could\nbe dispensed with. There were also medical treatises that suggested\nthat matter is active and that the soul dies with the body. There were\nthe works of Hobbes and Spinoza which argued for a materialistic\nmonism. In 1704 John Toland published his Letters to Serena\nin which he argues that motion is essential to matter. Finally, there\nwas a Christian mortalist strand in Protestantism. One strand of these\nChristian mortalists claimed to derive their mortalism from scripture\nalone and urged that the immaterial soul was a Platonic invention that\nhad been foisted on Christianity and should be dispensed with. In\nEngland, this movement can be traced back as far as William Tindale in\nthe sixteenth century and included such luminaries as Overton, Milton,\nand Hobbes. Henry Dodwell, a well respected biblical scholar, was one\nsuch figure in this tradition.\n",
