    "main_text": "The Problem of Provisos\n8. Reflections on Rationality\n\nThe publication of Thomas S. Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions (1962), ironically, was among the\nhistorical developments that contributed to a loss of confidence in\nscience. Kuhn\u2019s work, which turned \u201cparadigm\u201d into a\nhousehold word, was widely regarded as assimilating revolutions in\nscience to revolutions in politics, where one theory succeeds another\nonly upon the death of its adherents. It was interpreted as having\ndestroyed the myth that philosophers possess some special kind of\nwisdom or insight in relation to the nature of science or the thought\nprocesses of scientists with respect to their rationality, almost as\nthough every opinion were on a par with every other. A close reading\nof Kuhn\u2019s work shows that these were not his own conclusions,\nbut they were enormously influential. And among the public at large\nand many social scientists, the tendency to no longer hold science in\nhigh esteem or to be affected by its findings has induced political\nramifications that are inimical to the general good. When our beliefs\nare not well founded, actions we base upon them are unlikely to\nsucceed, often with unforeseen effects that are harmful. Rational\nactions ought to be based upon rational beliefs, where science has\nproven to be the most reliable method for acquiring knowledge about\nourselves and the world around us.\n\nThis study supports the conclusion that Hempel\u2019s conception of\nscientific explanations as involving the subsumption of singular\nevents by means of covering laws was well-founded, even though his\ncommitment to an extensional methodology inhibited him from embracing\na more adequate account of natural laws. The symmetry thesis turns out\nto require qualification, not only with respect to predictions for\nevents that occur only with low probability, but also for\nretrodictions derived by modus tollens. The link that most\naccurately embodies the relationship between Hempel\u2019s work on\nexplanation and decision-and-inference, as we have seen, appears to be\nreflected by the Principal Principle, which formalizes the\nrecognition that subjective (or personal) probabilities, as degrees of\nbelief, should have the same values as corresponding objective\nprobabilities, when they are known. The values of propensities as\nproperties of laws, no doubt, should be given precedence over the\nvalues of frequencies, insofar as laws, unlike frequencies, cannot be\nviolated and cannot be changed and thus provide the more reliable\nguide.\n\nA recent trend presumes that the philosophy of science has been\nmisconceived and requires \u201ca naturalistic turn\u201d as a kind\nof science of science more akin to history or to sociology than to\nphilosophy. In studies published in the twilight of his career, Hempel\ndemonstrated that, without standards to separate science from\npseudo-science, it would be impossible to distinguish frauds,\ncharlatans, and quacks from the real thing (Hempel 1979, 1983).\nWithout knowing \u201cthe standards of science\u201d, we would not\nknow which of those who call themselves \u201cscientists\u201d are\nscientists and which methods are \u201cscientific\u201d, where the\nplace of explanation remains central within the context of inference\nto the best explanation (Fetzer 2002). The philosophy of science,\ntherefore, cannot be displaced by history or by sociology. Not least\namong the important lessons of Hempel\u2019s enduring legacy is the\nrealization that the standards of science cannot be derived from mere\ndescriptions of its practice alone but require rational justification\nin the form of explications satisfying the highest standards of\nphilosophical rigor.\n",
