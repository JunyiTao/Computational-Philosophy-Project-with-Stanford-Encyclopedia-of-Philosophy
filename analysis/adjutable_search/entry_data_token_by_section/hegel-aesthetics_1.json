    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Texts and Lectures on Aesthetics\n2. Hegel\u2019s Texts and Lectures on Aesthetics\n\n\nHegel\u2019s published thoughts on aesthetics are to be found in\npars. 556\u201363 of the 1830 Encyclopaedia. Hegel also held\nlectures on aesthetics in Heidelberg in 1818 and in Berlin in 1820/21\n(winter semester), 1823 and 1826 (summer semesters), and 1828/29\n(winter semester). Transcripts of Hegel\u2019s lectures made by his\nstudents in 1820/21, 1823, 1826 and 1828/29 have now been published (though so\nfar only the 1823 lectures have been translated into English) (see\nBibliography). In 1835 (and then again in 1842) one of Hegel\u2019s\nstudents, Heinrich Gustav Hotho, published an edition of Hegel\u2019s\nlectures on aesthetics based on a manuscript of Hegel\u2019s (now lost) and\na series of lecture transcripts. This is available in English as:\nG.W.F. Hegel,\nAesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art, trans. T.M. Knox, 2 vols.\n(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975). Most of the secondary literature on\nHegel\u2019s aesthetics (in English and German) makes reference to\nHotho\u2019s edition. Yet according to one of the leading specialists\non Hegel\u2019s aesthetics, Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert, Hotho\ndistorted Hegel\u2019s thought in various ways: he gave Hegel\u2019s\naccount of art a much stricter systematic structure than Hegel himself\nhad given it, and he supplemented Hegel\u2019s account with material\nof his own (PK\u00c4, xiii\u2013xv). Gethmann-Siefert argues,\ntherefore, that we should not rely on Hotho\u2019s edition for our\nunderstanding of Hegel\u2019s aesthetics, but should instead base our\ninterpretation on the available lecture transcripts.\n\n\nSince Hegel\u2019s manuscript, on which Hotho based much of his\nedition, has been lost, it is no longer possible to determine with\ncertainty to what extent (if at all) Hotho did in fact distort\nHegel\u2019s account of art. It should also be noted that\nGethmann-Siefert\u2019s own interpretation of Hegel\u2019s aesthetics\nhas been called into question (see Houlgate 1986a).\nNevertheless Gethmann-Siefert is right to encourage readers with a\nknowledge of German to consult the published transcripts, since they\ncontain a wealth of important material, and in some cases material that\nis missing from the Hotho edition (such as the brief reference to\nCaspar David Friedrich in the 1820/21 lectures [V\u00c4, \n192]).\n\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of art has provoked considerable debate since his\ndeath in 1831. Does he believe that only Greek art is beautiful?  Does\nhe hold that art comes to an end in the modern age? The answers one\ngives to such questions should, however, be offered with a degree of\ncaution, for, sadly, there is no fully worked out philosophy of art by\nHegel that was officially endorsed by Hegel himself. The paragraphs in\nthe Encyclopaedia are written by Hegel, but they are very\nbrief and condensed and were intended to be supplemented by his\nlectures; the transcripts of the lectures are written by students of\nHegel (some taken down in class, some compiled afterwards from notes\ntaken in class); and the \u201cstandard\u201d edition of Hegel\u2019s\nlectures is a work put together by his student, Hotho (albeit using a\nmanuscript by Hegel himself). There is, therefore, no definitive\nedition of Hegel\u2019s fully developed aesthetic theory that would trump\nall others and settle all debate.\n",
