    "main_text": "Moral Theory and Clinical Bioethics || Models of Clinical Ethics Consultation\n7.1 Models of Clinical Ethics Consultation\n\nThe American Society for Bioethics and Humanities (ASBH) sets out\nthree possible models of clinical ethics consultation, endorsing one\nof them. Each model implicitly involves a picture of the role, or lack\nthereof, of moral theory. On the pure consensus model, the sole goal\nof ethics consultation is to forge agreement among those involved in\nthe consult (ASBH 2011: 7). It would seem that there is no role for\nmoral theory on this approach to clinical consultation, as mediation\nis the sole objective, with no eye held toward whether the consensus\nreached is morally justified through appeal to moral norms, accepted\nvalues, or moral theory. This model is generally taken to involve too\nweak a picture of the aims of clinical ethics consultation, and too\nminimal a picture of the clinical ethicist\u2019s expertise and role.\nOn the second model, the authoritarian model, the clinical ethicist\nis, by contrast, the primary moral decision maker. This model is\ngenerally taken to involve an overblown picture of the clinical\nethicist\u2019s authority and abilities, and of the infallibility of\nher perspective. The major downfall of this model, according to the\nASBH, is that the clinical ethicist disregards the decision-making\nauthority of others, such as a patient\u2019s family and the health\ncare team. Here again, moral theory has no explicit role, though it\ndoes seem possible and even likely that the clinical ethicist, in\nmaking her unilateral decision, invokes some moral theory or other in\ndoing so.\n\nThe third model, the ethics facilitation approach, is the approach\nendorsed by the ASBH, and there is general consensus in the field that\nthis is the best model for clinical ethics consultation. Here, the\nconsultant helps to make clear the moral issues at play, aids in\ncommunication, integrates the viewpoints of relevant stakeholders\n(ASBH 2011: 7). Importantly for the current discussion, this approach\ninvolves two main parts: identifying and analyzing of what is the\nmoral issue at stake, and facilitating of a principled ethical\nresolution. This second task is of particular interest to us here,\nbecause one would think that the building of such a resolution would\ninvolve looking to moral theory of some type or other, in addition to\nsimply consulting the ethics literature. How else will one adjudicate\nwhether the resolution falls within clearly accepted ethical\nprinciples? After all, the clinical ethicist is tasked not only with\nfacilitating a resolution, but with suggesting a range of ethically\nacceptable options and providing a rationale for each option. In\nspecifying an acceptable range of possible options, an ethics\nconsultant will draw on a knowledge of relevant institutional\npolicies, laws, the scholarly literature, and presumably also of moral\ntheory.\n",
