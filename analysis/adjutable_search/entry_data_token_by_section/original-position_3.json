Description of the Parties: Rationality and the Primary Social Goods\n\nRawls says that in the original position, \u201cthe Reasonable frames\nthe Rational\u201d (CP 319). He means the OP is a situation where\nrational choice of the parties is made subject to reasonable (or\nmoral) constraints. In what sense are the parties and their choice and\nagreement rational? Philosophers have different understandings of\npractical rationality. Rawls seeks to incorporate a relatively\nuncontroversial account of rationality into the original position, one\nthat he thinks most any account of practical rationality would endorse\nas at least necessary for rational decision. The parties are then\ndescribed as rational in a formal or \u201cthin\u201d sense that is\ncharacteristic of the theories of rational and social choice. They are\nresourceful, take effective means to their ends, and seek to make\ntheir preferences consistent. They also take the course of action that\nis more likely to achieve their ends (other things being equal). And\nthey choose courses of action that satisfy more rather than fewer of\ntheir purposes. Rawls calls these principles of rational choice the\n\u201ccounting principles\u201d (TJ \u00a7\u00a725, 63; JF 87).\n\nMore generally, for Rawls rational persons upon reflection can\nformulate a conception of their good, or of their primary\nvalues and purposes and the best way of life for themselves to live\ngiven their purposes. This conception incorporates their primary aims,\nambitions, and commitments to others, and is informed by the\nconscientious moral, religious, and philosophical convictions that\ngive meaning for them to their lives. Ideally, rational persons have\ncarefully thought about these things and their relative importance,\nand they can coherently order their purposes and commitments into a\n\u201crational plan of life,\u201d which extends over their\nlifetimes (TJ \u00a7\u00a763\u201364). For Rawls, rational persons\nregard life as a whole, and do not give preference to any particular\nperiod of it. Rather in drawing up their rational plans, they are\nequally concerned with their (future) good at each part of their\nlives. In this regard, rational persons are\nprudent\u2014they care for their future good, and while they\nmay discount the importance of future purposes based on probability\nassessments, they do not discount the achievement of their future\npurposes simply because they are in the future (TJ, \u00a745). (For a\ndifferent view, see Parfit, 1984)\n\nThese primary aims, convictions, ambitions, and commitments are among\nthe primary motivations of the parties in the original position. The\nparties want to provide favorable conditions for the pursuit of the\nvarious elements of the rational plan of life that defines a good life\nfor them. This is ultimately what the parties are trying to accomplish\nin their choice of principles of justice. In this sense they are\nrational.\n\nRawls says the parties in the original position are \u201cmutually\ndisinterested,\u201d in the sense that \u201cthey take no interest\nin each other\u2019s interests\u201d (TJ 110/[omitted in rev. ed.]).\nThis does not mean that they are self-interested or selfish persons,\nindifferent to the welfare of others. The interests advanced by the\nparties\u2019 life plans, Rawls says, \u201care not assumed to be\ninterests in the self, they are interests of a self that regards its\nconception of the good as worthy of satisfaction\u2026\u201d (TJ\n127/110) Most people are concerned, not just with their own happiness\nor welfare, but with others as well, and have all kinds of\ncommitments, including other-regarding, beneficent, and moral\npurposes, that are part of their conceptions of the good. But in the\noriginal position itself the parties are not altruistically motivated\nto benefit each other, in their capacity as contracting\nparties. They try to do as best as they can for themselves and\nfor those persons and causes that they care for. Their situation is\ncomparable, Rawls says, to that of \u201ctrustees or\nguardians\u201d acting to promote the interests of the beneficiaries\nthey represent. (JF, 84\u201385) Trustees cannot sacrifice the\nwell-being of the beneficiary they represent to benefit other trustees\nor individuals. If they did, they would be derelict in their duties.\nIt is perhaps to address the common criticism that the parties to the\noriginal position are self-interested that Rawls in the revised\nedition (TJ 110 rev.) omitted the phrase from the 1st\nedition, cited above, that \u201cthe parties take no interest in each\nother\u2019s interest.\u201d Moreover in later writings increasingly\nhe says that we should imagine that the parties are\n\u201crepresentatives\u201d of free and equal citizens and their\ninterests and \u201cact as guardians or trustees,\u201d seeking to\ndo as best as they can for the particular individuals that each\ntrustee represents. (PL \u00a74, JF\u00a724) In either case, Rawls\nbelieves this account of the parties\u2019 motivations promotes\ngreater clarity, and that to attribute to the parties moral\nmotivations or benevolence towards each other would not result in\ndefinite choice of a conception of justice (TJ,\n148\u20139/128\u20139; 584/512). (For example, how much benevolence\nshould the parties have towards one another or towards people in\ngeneral? Surely not impartial benevolence towards everyone, for then\nwe might as well dispense with the social contract and rely on a\ndisinterested impartial spectator point of view. It is one of the\n\u201ccircumstances of justice\u201d that people have different and\nconflicting values, and they value their own purposes and special\ncommitments to others more than they value others\u2019 purposes and\nspecial commitments, This is a good thing, not to be discouraged or\nundermined by justice, but rather regulated by it, since special\nobligations and commitments to specific others give meaning to\npeople\u2019s lives. (cf. Scheffler, 2001, chs.3, 4, 6) But if not\nequal concern for other parties and/or persons including themselves\n(and perhaps other animals), then how much care and concern should the\nparties in the original position exhibit towards others generally, as\ncompared with concern for themselves and their own good? (Half as much\nconcern for others\u2019 good as for their own? One-fifth as much?\nThere is no clear answer.) Rawls\u2019s thought is that, so far as\njustice is concerned, fair regard for others\u2019 interests is best\nrepresented by each party\u2019s rational choice behind a thick veil\nof ignorance; for each party has to be equally concerned with the\nconsequences of their choice of principles for each position in\nsociety, since they could end up in that same position.\n\nMutual disinterest of the parties also means they are not moved by\nenvy or rancor towards each other or others generally. This implies\nthat the parties do not strive to be wealthier or better off than\nothers for its own sake, and thus do not sacrifice advantages to\nprevent others from having more than they do. Instead, each party in\nthe original position is motivated to do as well as they can in\npromoting the optimal achievement of the many purposes that constitute\ntheir rational conception of the good, without regard to how much or\nhow little others may have. For this reason they strive to guarantee\nthemselves a share of primary social goods that is at least sufficient\nto enable them each to effectively pursue their (unknown) conception\nof the good.\n\nAnother feature of the parties is that they represent not just\nthemselves, but also family lines, including their descendants, or at\nleast their own children. This assumption is needed, Rawls says, to\ninclude representation of \u201cthe interests of all,\u201d\nincluding children and future generations. In the first edition of\nTheory Rawls says. \u201cFor example, we may think of the\nparties as heads of families and therefore as having a desire to\nfurther the welfare of their nearest descendants\u201d (Rawls 1971,\n128). Because of criticisms of the heads of families assumption, (by\nEnglish, 1977 and others) Rawls said in the revised edition that the\nproblem of future generations can be addressed by the parties assuming\nthat all preceding generations have followed the same principles that\nthe parties choose to apply to future generations. (Rawls 1999a, 111\nrev.). The \u201cheads of families\u201d assumption is discussed\nfurther in connection with feminist criticisms of Rawls in the\nsupplementary section:\n\nA Liberal Feminist Critique of the Original Position and Justice within the Family\n\n\nin the supplementary document\n Further Topics on the Original Position.\n\nThough the parties are not motivated by beneficence or even a concern\nfor justice, still they have a moral capacity for\nreasonableness and a sense of justice (TJ, 145/125\nrev.). Rawls distinguishes between the requirements of rationality and\nreasonableness; both are part of practical reasoning about what we\nought to do (JF 6\u20137; 81\u20132). The concept of \u201cthe\nRational\u201d concerns a person\u2019s good\u2014hence\nRawls refers to his account of the good as \u201cgoodness as\nrationality.\u201d A person\u2019s good for Rawls is the rational\nplan of life they would choose under hypothetical conditions of\n\u201cdeliberative rationality,\u201d where there is full knowledge\nof one\u2019s circumstances, capacities, and interests, as well as\nknowledge of the likelihood of succeeding at alternative life plans\none may be drawn to (TJ, \u00a764). \u201cThe Reasonable\u201d on\nthe other hand addresses the concept and principles of right,\nincluding individual moral duties and obligations as well as moral\nrequirements of right and justice that apply to institutions and\nsociety. Both rationality and reasonableness are independent aspects\nof practical reason for Rawls. They are independent in that Rawls,\nunlike Hobbes and other interest-based social contract views, does not\nregard justice and the reasonable as simply principles of prudence\nthat are beneficial for a person to comply with in order to\nsuccessfully pursue their purposes in social contexts. (Cf. Gauthier,\n1984) Unlike Hobbes, Rawls does not argue that an immoral or unjust\nperson is irrational, or that morality is necessarily required by\nrationality in the narrow sense of maximizing individual utility or\ntaking effective means to realize one\u2019s purposes.  But\nrational persons who violate demands of justice are unreasonable in so\nfar as they infringe upon moral principles and requirements of\npractical reasoning. Being reasonable, even if not required by\nrationality, is still an independent aspect of practical reason. Rawls\nresembles Kant in this regard (PL 25n); his distinction between the\nreasonable and rational parallels Kant\u2019s distinction between\ncategorical and hypothetical imperatives.\n\nEssential to being reasonable is having a sense of justice\nwith the capacities to understand and reason about and act upon what\njustice requires. The sense of justice is a normally effective desire\nto comply with duties and obligations required by justice; it includes\na willingness to cooperate with others on terms that are fair and that\nreasonable persons can accept and endorse. Rawls sees a sense of\njustice as an attribute people normally have; it \u201cwould appear\nto be a condition for human sociability\u201d (TJ, 495/433 rev.). He\nrejects the idea that people are motivated only by\nself-interest in all that they do; he also rejects the Hobbesian\nassumption that a willingness to do justice must be grounded in\nenlightened self-interest. It is essential to Rawls\u2019s argument\nfor the feasibility and stability of justice as fairness that the\nparties upon entering society have an effective sense of justice, and\nthat they are capable of doing what justice requires of them for its\nown sake, or at least because they believe this is what morality\nrequires of them. An amoralist, Rawls believes, is largely a\nphilosophical construct; amoralists who actually exist Rawls regards\nas sociopaths. \u201cA capacity for a sense of justice \u2026 would\nappear to be a condition of sociability\u201d (TJ 495/433).\n\nSubsequent to A Theory of Justice, beginning in\n\u2018Kantian Constructivism in Moral Theory,\u2019 (1980) (CP\n303ff.) Rawls says that the parties to the original position have a\n\u201chighest-order interest\u201d in the development and full and\ninformed exercise of their two \u201cmoral powers\u201d: their\ncapacity for a sense of justice as well as in their capacity for a\nrational conception of the good. Fulfilling these interests in the\nmoral powers is one of the main aims behind their agreement on\nprinciples of justice. Subsequently in Political Liberalism\n(1993) Rawls changed this to the parties\u2019 \u201chigher order\ninterests\u201d in development and exercise of the two moral powers\n(to avoid giving the appearance that the moral powers were final ends\nfor free and equal moral persons, as was argued in TJ). The\nparties\u2019 interest in developing these two moral powers is a\nsubstantive feature of Rawls\u2019s account of the rationality of\nfree and equal persons in the original position itself. (In this\nregard, his account of goodness as rationality is not as\n\u201cthin\u201d as in social theory; cf. TJ 143/124 rev.) Here\nRawls is still not attributing specifically moral motives\u2014a\ndesire to be reasonable and do what is right and just for their own\nsake\u2014to the parties in the original position. The idea\nbehind the parties\u2019 rationality in cultivating their sense of\njustice is that, since being reasonable and exercising one\u2019s\nsense of justice by complying with fair terms is a condition of human\nsociability and social cooperation, then it is in people\u2019s\nrational interest\u2014part of their good\u2014that they\nnormally develop their capacities for justice under social conditions.\nOtherwise they will not be in a position to cooperate with others and\nbenefit from social life. A person who is without a sense of justice\nis wholly unreasonable and as a result is normally eschewed by others,\nfor they are not trustworthy or reliable or even safe to interact\nwith. Since having a sense of justice is a condition of taking part in\nsocial cooperation, the parties have a \u201chigher-order\ninterest\u201d in establishing conditions for the development and\nfull exercise of their capacity for a sense of justice. The\nparties\u2019 interest in developing their capacity for a sense of\njustice is then a rational interest in being reasonable; justice is\nthen regarded by the parties as instrumental to their\nrealizing their conception of the good. (Here again, it is important\nto distinguish the purely rational motivation of the parties or their\ntrustees in the original position from that of free and equal citizens\nin a well-ordered society, who are normally morally motivated by their\nsense of justice to do what is right and just for its own sake.)\n\nThree factors then play a role in motivating the parties in the\noriginal position: (1) First, they aim to advance their determinate\nconception of the good, or rational plan of life, even though they do\nnot know what that conception is. Moreover, they also seek conditions\nthat enable them to exercise and develop their \u201cmoral\npowers,\u201d namely (2) their rational capacities to form, revise\nand rationally pursue a conception of their good, and (3) their\ncapacity to be reasonable and to have an effective sense of justice.\nThese are the three \u201chigher-order interests\u201d the parties\nto Rawls\u2019s original position aim to promote in their agreement\non principles of justice.\n\nThe three higher-order interests provide the basis for Rawls\u2019s\naccount of primary social goods. (TJ \u00a715, PL\n178\u2013190) The primary goods are the all-purpose social means that\nare necessary to the exercise and development of the moral powers and\nto pursue a wide variety of conceptions of the good. Rawls describes\nthem initially in Theory as goods that any rational person\nshould want, whatever their rational plan of life. The primary social\ngoods are basically: rights and liberties; powers and diverse\nopportunities; income and wealth; and the social bases of\nself-respect. \u2018Powers\u2019 refer not (simply) to a capacity to\neffect outcomes or influence others\u2019 behavior. Rawls rather uses\nthe term \u2018powers\u2019 to refer to the legal and other\ninstitutional abilities and prerogatives that attend offices and\nsocial position. Hence, he sometimes refers to the primary goods of\n\u201cpowers and prerogatives of offices and positions of authority\nand responsibility\u201d (JF 58). Members of various professions and\ntrades have institutional powers and prerogatives that are\ncharacteristic of their position and which are necessary if they are\nto carry out their respective roles and responsibilities. By income\nand wealth Rawls says he intends \u201call-purpose means\u201d that\nhave an exchange value, which are generally needed to achieve a wide\nrange of ends (JF 58\u201359). Finally, \u201cthe social bases of\nself-respect\u201d are features of institutions that are needed to\nenable people to have the confidence that they and their position in\nsociety are respected and that their conception of the good is worth\npursuing and achievable by themselves. These features depend upon\nhistory and culture. Primary among these social bases of self respect\nin a democratic society, Rawls will contend, are equal recognition of\npersons as citizens, and hence the institutional conditions needed for\nequal citizenship, including equality of basic rights and liberties\nwith equal political rights; fair equality of opportunities; and\npersonal independence guaranteed by adequate material means for\nachieving it. The social bases of self-respect are crucial to\nRawls\u2019s argument for equal basic liberties, especially\npolitical equality and equal rights of political participation.\n\nThe parties to the original position are motivated to achieve a fully\nadequate share of primary goods so they can achieve their higher-order\ninterests in pursuing their rational plans of life and exercising\ntheir moral powers. \u201cThey assume that they normally prefer more\nprimary social goods rather than less\u201d (TJ, 142/123 rev.). This\ntoo is part of being rational. Because they are not envious, their\nconcern is with the absolute level of primary goods, not their share\nrelative to other persons.\n\nTo sum up, the parties in the original position are formally rational\nin that they are assumed to have and to effectively pursue a rational\nplan of life with a schedule of coherent purposes and commitments that\nthey find valuable and give their lives meaning. As part of their\nrational plans, they have a substantive interest in the adequate\ndevelopment and full exercise of their capacities to be rational and\nto be reasonable. These \u201chigher-order interests\u201d together\nwith their rational life plans provide them with sufficient reason to\nprocure for themselves in their choice of principles of justice an\nadequate share of the primary social goods that enable them to achieve\nthese higher-order ends and effectively pursue their conceptions of\nthe good.\n\nA final feature of Rawls\u2019s account of rationality is a normal\nhuman tendency he calls \u201cthe Aristotelian principle\u201d (TJ\nsect.65). This \u201cdeep psychological fact\u201d says that, other\nthings being equal, people normally find activities that call upon the\nexercise of their developed capacities to be more interesting and\npreferable to engaging in simpler tasks, and their enjoyment increases\nthe more the capacity is developed and realized and the greater the\ncomplexity of activities (TJ, 426/374). Humans enjoy doing something\nas they become more proficient at it, and of two activities they\nperform equally well, they normally prefer the one that calls upon a\nlarger repertoire of more intricate and subtler discriminations.\nRawls\u2019s examples: someone who does both activities well\ngenerally prefers playing chess to checkers, and studying algebra to\narithmetic. (TJ 426/374) Moreover Rawls, citing J.S. Mill believes\nthat development at least some of our \u201chigher capacities\u201d\n(Mill\u2019s term) is normally important to our sense of\nself-respect. These general facts imply that rational people should\nincorporate into their life plans activities that call upon the\nexercise and development of their talents and skills and distinctly\nhuman capacities (TJ 432/379). This motivation becomes especially\nrelevant to Rawls\u2019s argument for the stability of justice as\nfairness, the good of social union, and the good of justice (TJ\n\u00a779, \u00a786; see below, \u00a75.3). The important point here is\nthat the Aristotelian principle is taken into account by the parties\nin their decision on principles of justice. They want to choose\nprinciples that maintain their sense of self-respect and enable them\nto freely develop their human capacities and pursue a wide range of\nactivities, as well as engage their capacities for a sense of\njustice.\n",
