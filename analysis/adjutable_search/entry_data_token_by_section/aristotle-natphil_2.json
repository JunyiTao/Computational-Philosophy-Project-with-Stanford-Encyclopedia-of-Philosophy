Priority among motions\n\nEven though the foregoing might have suggested that generation of\nsubstances is fundamental for all the other kinds of changes, in fact\nlocomotion will have a privileged status. All other changes depend on\nlocomotions, because any two entities involved in change, with their\nactive and passive potentialities, respectively, need to come into\ncontact in order for the interaction to\n occur.[32]\n Contact, however, as a rule needs to be established by locomotion:\neither the entity to be moved, or the mover, or both, need to proceed\nso that they meet (Physics 8.7, 260a26\u2013b7). Moreover\nlocomotion is the form of change which can occur in isolation of\ngeneration, perishing and the other forms of change (Physics\n8.7, 260b26\u201329). Other changes are independent kinds of change\ninsofar as they can occur in an entity which does not perform any\nother change. Nevertheless all these forms of change include or\npresuppose that some other entity engages in\n locomotion.[33]\n\nAristotle argues at the opening of Physics bk. 8 that motion\nand change in the universe can have no beginning, because the\noccurrence of change presupposes a previous process of change. With\nthis argument Aristotle can establish an eternal chain of motions and\nrefute those who hold that there could have been a previous stationary\nstate of the universe. Such an eternal chain, Aristotle argues, needs\nto rely on a cause which guarantees its persistence: if each of the\nconstitutive processes in the causally connected web were of finite\nduration, for every one of them it can be the case that it is not\npresent in the world, indeed, at some later time it will not be\npresent any longer. But then the whole causally connected series of\nevents, Aristotle claims, would also be\n contingent.[34]\n Hence Aristotle postulates that the processes of the universe depend\non an eternal motion (or on several eternal motions), the eternal\nrevolution of the heavenly spheres, which in turn is dependent on one\nor several unmoved movers (Physics 8.6,\n 258b26\u2013259a9).[35]\n\nThe priority of the eternal celestial revolutions, furthermore,\nguarantees the causal finitude of the universe. This is so, even\nthough there are infinite causal chains: behind every single\nindividual of an animal species there is an infinite series of male\nancestors, each causally responsible for the subsequent members in the\nseries, because Aristotelian species are eternal and male parents are\nthe efficient causes of their\n offspring.[36]\n Left to its own devices, the finite universe on its own would\ncertainly reach a dissolution, a state of complete separation of the\nelemental masses into their concentrically arranged natural places. In\nview of the fact that such a complete segregation of the elemental\nmasses is avoided through the constant excitation caused by the\ncelestial motions, producing heat in the sublunary domain, especially\naround the regions of the\n Sun,[37]\n Aristotle will be entitled to assert that the cause of the human\nbeing is in the first instance his or her father, but is at the same\ntime the Sun as it moves along its annual ecliptic\n path.[38]\n Between celestial revolutions and the individual natural processes\nthere is always a finite causal chain, as these natural processes\ncould not possibly have continued without the celestial motions. The\ninfinite causal chains passing through male parents cannot subsist on\ntheir own without this constant external support, and this dependence\ncan always be analysed in terms of finite causal chains.\n",
