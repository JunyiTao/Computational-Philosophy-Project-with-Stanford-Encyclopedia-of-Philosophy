Above all, the contents of perception tend to be\nstructured in terms of figure-ground organization, which is to say the\norganization of the visual field into objects that stand out from\ntheir surroundings (Rubin 1915), and here again we find a tension\nbetween bona fide and fiat articulations whose\nphilosophical significance extends well beyond the remarks of Section\n1.2.\n\nOn the one hand, the objects we see and track most easily are those\nthat stand out by virtue of the natural boundaries they seem to enjoy.\nThe use of edge-detection techniques for object recognition in\ncomputer vision (see e.g. Davies 2012) is motivated precisely by this\nconsideration, for in normal circumstances such boundaries correspond\nto salient discontinuities in the depth and brightness of the\nperceived scene. The very fact that humans, from the time they are\ninfants, tend to reify such non-entities as holes and shadows just as\neasily as they do with regard to material objects (Giralt and Bloom\n2000; Nelson and Palmer 2001) lends evidence to the importance of\n\u201cnatural\u201d discontinuities in the segmentation of the\nvisual scene: the possession of a genuine boundary is a sign of\nobjecthood.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also a fact that sometimes we parse the\nvisual scene in terms of boundaries that involve the creative\ncontribution of our perceptual apparatus, which, as we know from\nSchumann\u2019s classic work on illusory contours, tends to\narticulate reality in terms of continuous borders even when such\nborders \u201care objectively not there\u201d (1900: 26).\nKanizsa\u2019s triangle (1955) is perhaps the example that best\nepitomizes this phenomenon. But the same could be said of many other\nways in which fiat boundaries emerge from the figure-ground\norganization of the visual field through the basic factors studied by\nGestalt psychologists, such as proximity, continuity, closure, color\nand texture similarity, good form, etc. (Wertheimer 1923; Koffka\n1935). There is, we said, no bona fide boundary in a Seurat painting,\nexcept perhaps around each individual color spot; yet we see each\n\u201cfigure\u201d as though it possessed a regular contour.\n\nIn Section 1.2 we noted that such considerations are relevant to the\nmetaphysical question of whether all boundaries \u2014 and, with\nthem, the identity and persistence conditions of those things that\nhave boundaries \u2014 are on closer look the product of our own\nworldmaking, a sign of that mismatch between appearance and reality\nthat may lead one to embrace an across-the-board anti-realist stance\ntowards the ontology of ordinary objects and events. That is one\nimportant line of philosophical inquiry. But one may also want to know\nmore about the structure of appearance as such. One may be interested\nin the mechanisms of perceptual organization insofar as they may\nreveal something about us. This is a distinguished subject of\ninquiry in philosophy over and above its significance for psychology\n(see Wagemans 2015 for a representative collection of recent work). It\nis, for sure, an important subject of further inquiry for anyone\ninterested in the surreptitious, pervasive, stubborn, enigmatic\nintrusion of boundaries in our picture of the world.\n",
