    "main_text": "Epistemological Approaches || Belief Revision Theory\n4.3 Belief Revision Theory\n\nAlchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson (1982) developed a\nformal theory of belief revision and contraction, drawing largely on\nWillard van Orman Quine\u2019s model of the web of belief\n(Quine and Ullian 1970). The cognitive agent is modelled as believing\na set of propositions that are ordered by their degree of\nentrenchment. This model provides the basis for a set of normative\nconstraints on belief contraction (subtracting a belief) and belief\nrevision (adding a new belief that is inconsistent with the original\nset). When a belief is added that is logically consistent with the\noriginal belief set, the agent is supposed to believe the logical\nclosure of the original set plus the new belief. When a belief is\nadded that is inconsistent with the original set, the agent retreats\nto the most entrenched of the maximal subsets of the set that are\nconsistent with the new belief, adding the new proposition to that set\nand closing under logical consequence. For the axioms of the AGM\nmodel, see the following supplementary document:\n\nAGM Postulates\n\n\nAGM belief revision theory can be used as the basis for a system of\ndefeasible reasoning or nonmonotonic logic, as G\u00e4rdenfors and\nMakinson have recognized (Makinson and G\u00e4rdenfors 1991). If\n\\(K\\) is an epistemic state, then a nonmonotonic consequence\nrelation\n\\(\\dproves\\)\ncan be defined as follows: \\(A \\dproves B\\) iff \\(B \\in K * A\\). Unlike\nPollock\u2019s system or semantic inheritance networks, this\ndefeasible consequence relation depends upon a background epistemic\nstate. Thus, the belief revision approach gives rise, not to a single\nnonmonotonic consequence relation, but to family of relations. Each\nbackground state \\(K\\) gives rise to its own characteristic\nconsequence relation.\n\nOne significant limitation of the belief-revision approach is that\nthere is no representation in the object-language of a defeasible or\ndefault rule or conditional (that is, of a conditional of the form\nIf p, then normally q or That p would be a prima facie\nreason for accepting that q). In fact, G\u00e4rdenfors\n(G\u00e4rdenfors 1978; G\u00e4rdenfors 1986) proved that no\nconditional satisfying the Ramsey test can be added to the AGM system\nwithout trivializing the revision\n relation.[1]\n (A conditional \\(\\Rightarrow\\) satisfies the Ramsey test just in\ncase, for every epistemic state \\(K, K\\) includes \\((A \\Rightarrow\nB)\\) iff \\(K * A\\) includes \\(B\\).)\n\nSince the AGM system cannot include conditional beliefs, it cannot\nelucidate the question of what logical relationships hold between\nconditional defaults.\n\nThe lack of a representation of conditional beliefs is closely\nconnected to another limitation of the AGM system: its inability to\nmodel repeated or iterated belief revision. The input to a\nbelief change is an epistemic state, consisting both of a set of\npropositions believed and an entrenchment relation on that set. The\noutput of an AGM revision, in contrast, consists simply of a set of\nbeliefs. The system provides no guidance on the question of what would\nbe the result of revising an epistemic state in two or more steps. If\nthe entrenchment relation could be explicitly represented by means of\nconditional propositions, then it would be possible to define the new\nentrenchment relation that would result from a single belief revision,\nmaking iterated belief revision representable. A number of proposals\nalong these lines have been made. The difficulty lies in defining\nexactly what would constitute a minimal change in the\nrelative entrenchment or epistemic ranking of a set of beliefs. To\nthis point, no clear consensus has emerged on this question. (See\nSpohn 1988; Nayak 1994; Wobcke 1995; Bochman 2001.)\n\nOn the larger question of the relation between belief revision and\ndefeasible reasoning, there are two possibilities: that a theory of\ndefeasible reasoning should be grounded in a theory of belief\nrevision, and that a theory of belief revision should be grounded in a\ntheory of defeasible reasoning. The second view has been defended by\nJohn Pollock (Pollock 1987; Pollock 1995) and by Hans Rott (Rott\n1989). On this second view, we must make a sharp distinction between\nbasic or foundational beliefs on the one hand and inferred or derived\nbeliefs on the other. We can then model belief change on the\nassumption that new beliefs are added to the foundation (and are\nlogically consistent with the existing set of those beliefs). Beliefs\ncan be added which are inconsistent with previous inferred beliefs,\nand the new belief state consists simply in the closure of the new\nfoundational set under the relation of defeasible consequence. On such\nan approach, default conditionals can be explicitly represented among\nthe agent\u2019s beliefs. G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality result\nis then avoided by rejecting one of the assumptions of the theorem,\npreservation:\n\nPreservation:\nIf \\(\\neg A \\not\\in K\\),then \\(K \\subseteq K * A\\).\n\nFrom the perspective that uses defeasible reasoning to define belief\nrevision, there is no good reason to accept Preservation. One can add\na belief that is consistent with what one already believes and thereby\nlose beliefs, since the new information might be an\nundercutting defeater to some defeasible inference that had been\nsuccessful.\n",
