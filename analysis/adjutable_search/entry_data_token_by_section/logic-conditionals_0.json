    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nLogics of conditionals deal with inferences involving sentences of the\nform \u201cif A, (then) B\u201d of natural\nlanguage. Despite the overwhelming presence of such sentences in\neveryday discourse and reasoning, there is surprisingly little\nagreement about what the right logic of conditionals might be, or even\nabout whether a unified theory can be given for all kinds of\nconditionals. The problem is not new, but can be traced back to\ndebates between Megarian and Stoic logicians (see Sextus Empiricus,\nOutlines of Scepticism II, 110\u2013112; Kneale & Kneale\n1962; Sanford 1989; Weiss 2019). Famously, Philo of Megara proposed\nthat a conditional of the form \u201cif A then\nB\u201d is true exactly when it is not the case that\nA is true and B is false. The same definition is at\nthe core of the modern treatment of the conditional as so-called\n\u201cmaterial implication\u201d in the two-valued propositional\nframework of Frege (1879) and Whitehead and Russell (1910).\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(B\\) \n\n\\(A \\supset B\\)\n1\n0  \n\n\n\\(A\\)\n1\n1\n0 \n\n0\n1\n1  \n\n\nTable 1: The material conditional\n\n\nThis understanding of the conditional has considerable virtues of\nsimplicity, and in that regard the material conditional analysis\nprovides a benchmark for other theories. Probably its main virtue is\nthat it lends itself to a truth-functional treatment (the truth value\nof a conditional is a function of the truth values of antecedent and\nconsequent). A related one is that it makes the conditional\ninterdefinable with Boolean negation, disjunction, and conjunction. A\nthird, among the driving motivations for Frege, Russell and Whitehead,\nis that it appears adequate to regiment mathematical proofs involving\nconditional sentences. Despite that, as granted by Frege himself in\nthe Begriffsschrift, it fails to do justice to some of the\nways in which conditionals are ordinarily understood and used in\nnatural language.\n\nAn oddity pointed out early by MacColl (1908) is the observation that\nof any two sentences of the form \u201cnot A or\nB\u201d and \u201cnot B or A\u201d, at\nleast one must be true. Assuming the equivalence with the material\nconditional, this implies that either \u201cif John is a physician,\nthen he is red-haired\u201d or \u201cif John is red-haired, then he\nis a physician\u201d must be true. Intuitively, however, one may be\ninclined to reject both conditionals. Similar complications, known as\nthe paradoxes of material implication, concern the fact that\nfor any sentences A and B, \u201cif A then\nB\u201d follows from \u201cnot A\u201d, but also\nfrom \u201cB\u201d, thereby allowing true and false\nsentences to create true conditionals irrespective of their content\n(C. I. Lewis 1912). Another peculiarity looms large: the negation of\n\u201cif A then B\u201d is predicted to be\n\u201cA and not B\u201d, but intuitively one may\ndeny that \u201cif God exists, all criminals will go to heaven\u201d\nwithout committing oneself to the existence of God (cited in Lycan\n2001).\n\nA fourth complication is that conditional sentences in natural\nlanguage are not limited to indicative conditionals (\u201cif I\nstrike this match, it will light\u201d), but also include subjunctive\nconditionals used to express counterfactual hypotheses (\u201cif I\nhad struck this match, it would have lit\u201d). All counterfactual\nconditionals would be vacuously true if analyzed as material\nconditionals with a false antecedent, as pointed out by Quine (1950),\nan obviously inadequate result, suggesting that the interplay of\ngrammatical tense and grammatical mood should also be of concern to\nunderstand the logic of conditionals.\n\nTo a large extent, the development of conditional logics over the past\ncentury has thus been driven by the quest for a more sophisticated\naccount of the connection between antecedent and consequent in\nconditionals. A number of conditional logics have thus been developed\nwithin the framework of modal logic, to capture the idea that\nconditional sentences express a necessary connection of sort between\nantecedent and consequent, whether metaphysical, epistemic, or deontic\n(see C. I. Lewis 1912; Stalnaker 1968; D. Lewis 1973; Kratzer 2012). A\nrelated wave of work encompasses the so-called cotenability theories\nof conditionals, in which the idea is that a conditional is assertable\nif its antecedent, together with suitable (co-tenable) premises,\nentails its consequent (see Chisholm 1946; Goodman 1955; Rescher\n1964).\n\nAnother strand of influential logics has been motivated by the idea\nthat conditionals have probabilities or express a probabilistic\ndependence between their antecedents and their consequents (Ramsey\n1931; de Finetti 1936; Adams 1965; Edgington 1995; Douven 2016). A\nvery influential source of this is a passage by Ramsey (1931), in\nwhich he writes:\n\n\nIf two people are arguing \u201cIf \\(p\\), then \\(q\\)?\u201d and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically to\ntheir stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\); so\nthat in a sense \u201cIf \\(p\\), \\(q\\)\u201d and \u201cIf \\(p\\),\n\\(\\neg q\\)\u201d are contradictories. We can say that they are fixing\ntheir degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). If \\(p\\) turns out false,\nthese degrees of belief are rendered void. If either party\nbelieves not \\(p\\) for certain, the question ceases to mean\nanything to him except as a question about what follows from certain\nlaws or hypothesis. [Notation adapted]\n\n\nImportantly, the so-called Ramsey Test (adding the antecedent\nhypothetically to one\u2019s beliefs) has inspired a number of\napproaches that stand as some of the cornerstones of conditional\nlogics. This includes Stalnaker\u2019s modal logic of conditionals\nbased on the idea that the antecedent of a conditional selects a\nhypothetical possible world (Stalnaker 1968). It also includes\nAdams\u2019s approach based on studying formally the idea that the\nprobability of (non-nested) conditionals is given by the corresponding\nconditional probability (Adams 1965, 1975), as well as more\nqualitative theories of the acceptability of conditionals in terms of\n(non-probabilistic) belief revision policies (G\u00e4rdenfors 1986).\nFinally, Ramsey\u2019s idea that conditionals with a false antecedent\nare void underlies the main motivation behind three-valued accounts of\nconditionals, developed independently by various authors (in\nparticular by de Finetti 1936).\n\nIn this entry, our presentation of conditional logics will be\nstructured by the centrality of those various frameworks. Our goal in\nparticular will be to allow readers to orient themselves easily\nbetween those frameworks, and also to show how they communicate. We\nstart with a presentation of three-valued logics of conditionals in\n section 2.\n Section 3 surveys the main analyses of the conditional in modal\nlogics (possible worlds semantics). In\n section 4,\n we discuss so-called premise semantics, which formalize the\nco-tenability idea, and which shed a different light on standard modal\nanalyses.\n Section 5\n moves on to probabilistic logics of conditionals, and\n section 6\n to qualitative approaches in terms of belief revision.\n Section 7\n and\n section 8,\n finally, will present more recent developments or refinements: first,\nlogics based on the idea that the antecedent ought to make a relevant\ndifference to the consequent, then some extensions of propositional\nlogics of conditionals addressing the interaction of conditionals with\nmodalities as well as with questions and commands.\n\nOne caveat is that in this entry we will try to keep a unified\nperspective on both indicative and subjunctive conditionals. Although\nsome authors, notably David Lewis, have insisted on treating them\ndifferently, differences can be handled parametrically relative to a\ncommon semantic core (viz., Stalnaker 1975 or Pearl 2009). We will\npoint to differences when relevant, but refer the reader to\nStarr\u2019s (2019) SEP entry on counterfactuals that deals with the\ntopic rather extensively. On some aspects our entry also overlaps with\nEdgington\u2019s (2020) SEP entry on indicative conditionals, and\nreaders are invited to consult both of those entries for\ncomplements.\n\nIn what follows, we will represent the conditional operator by the\nsymbol \\(>\\). We distinguish three main layers of syntactic\ncomplexity. Let \\(L_0\\) be a propositional language capable of\nbuilding factual sentences from atoms with the help of the\nusual Boolean connectives (\\(\\neg\\), \\(\\wedge\\), \\(\\vee\\), \\(\\supset\\)\nand \\(\\equiv\\) for negation, conjunction, disjunction, material\nconditional and material equivalence, respectively). Then \\(L_1\\) is\nthe extension of \\(L_0\\) with flat conditionals, such that if\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are in \\(L_0\\) then \\(A>B\\) is in \\(L_1\\). And\n\\(L_2\\) is the extension of \\(L_0\\) and \\(L_1\\) allowing free\ncombinations of all connectives, including arbitrary nestings of\nconditionals.\n",
