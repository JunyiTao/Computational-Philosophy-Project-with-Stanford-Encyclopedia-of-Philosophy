    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\n\nWilliam Stanley Jevons was born in Liverpool on 1 September 1835. His\nfather Thomas Jevons (1791\u20131855) was an iron merchant; his\nmother Mary Anne Roscoe (1795\u20131845) grew up in an intellectual\nand artistic milieu. The railway boom crisis of 1847 caused the\nbankruptcy of the family firm. William Stanley Jevons went to\nUniversity College School in London in 1850, and in 1851 to University\nCollege. He studied chemistry under Graham and Williamson, two\npioneers in the development of atomic theory and the theory of\nmolecular motion. Another major influence at University College was\nAugustus De Morgan (1806\u20131871), with his courses on mathematics\nand logic. Jevons left University College without taking his\ndegree. In 1854 he travelled to Sydney, in order to become an\nassayer at the Australian mint. Jevons devoted much time to private\nstudy. His work covered many different areas: railway policy,\nmeteorology, protection, land policy, cloud formation, gunpowder and\nlightning, geology, etc. Jevons left Australia in 1859 and returned to\nUniversity College to complete his education. The early 1860s are\nimportant for Jevons' intellectual development, and he reports in his\ndiary that he received significant insights in both economics and\nlogic: a \u201ctrue comprehension of value\u201d (Black 1981: 120,\nLa Nauze 1953) and the \u201csubstitution of similars\u201d (Black\n& K\u00f6nekamp 1972: 179).\n\n\nJevons received his MA degree in 1862, and was awarded the gold\nmedal \u2018in the third branch\u2019 which included logic, moral\nphilosophy, political philosophy, history of philosophy and political\neconomy. In 1863 Jevons became a tutor at Owens College,\nManchester, and in 1865 a lecturer in political economy and\nlogic. In 1867 Jevons married Harriet A. Taylor, and they\nsubsequently had three children. The family moved to London in\n1876, on his taking up a chair at University College. \nJevons' short life came to an end in 1882, when he drowned near\nHastings.\n2. The Laws of Thought\n\n Like many representatives of 19th-century logic and\nphilosophy of science, Jevons starts his investigation by examining the\nnature of the Laws of Thought. Jevons argues that these Laws are\ntrue both \u201cin the nature of thought and things\u201d. \nGiven that science is in the mind and not in the things, the Laws of\nThought seem to be purely subjective and only verified in the\nobservation of the external world. However, Jevons argues that it\nis impossible to prove the fundamental laws of logic by reasoning,\nsince they are already presupposed by the notion of a proof. \nHence, the Laws of Thought must be presupposed by science as \u201cthe\nprior conditions of all thought and all knowledge\u201d. \nFurthermore, our thoughts cannot be used as a criterion of truth, since\nwe all know that mistakes are possible and omnipresent. Hence, we\nneed to presuppose objective Laws of Thought in order to discriminate\nbetween correct and incorrect reasoning. It follows that Jevons\nregards the Laws of Thought as objective laws.\n\n The fundamental mental powers for knowledge acquisition are the power\nto discriminate, to detect identity and to retain. The\nfundamental laws of thought are threefold: the Law of Identity, the Law\nof Contradiction and the Law of Duality. The first law is\ndescribed as \u201cWhatever is, is\u201d and implies that a thing is\nalways identical with itself. Jevons does not define the concept\nof \u201cidentity\u201d, and tends to regard it as\nself-evident. The second law is the classical law of\ncontradiction: \u201cA thing cannot both be and not be\u201d. \nThe third law is the law of the excluded middle: \u201cA thing must\neither be or not be.\u201d  Jevons suggests that these three laws\nare merely different aspects of one and the same Law, but considers it\nimpossible to express this Law in less than three lines. His\nsymbolic representation of these laws is as follows:\n\n\n\n(1)\nA = A\nLaw of Identity\n\n\n(2)\nAa = 0\nLaw of Contradiction\n\n\n(3)\nA = AB \u00b7|\u00b7 Ab\nLaw of Duality\n\n\n\n\n The absence of a clear definition of \u2018identity\u2019 is\nstriking, especially since Jevons recognises that there are different\nkinds and degrees of sameness. The main problem is then to point\nout a \u201csufficient degree of likeness or sameness\u201d. \nThe simplest form of inference is making use of a pattern, proxy,\nexample or sample. If the sample \u201cexactly represents the\ntexture, appearance, and general nature\u201d of a certain commodity,\nthen what is true for the sample will also be true for the commodity as\na whole. This approach evades defining similarity, as it\npresupposes that the sample is an \u2018exact representation\u2019 of\nthe commodity whereas it is unclear under what conditions that would be\nthe case. All processes of inference are based on the principle\nof substitution. All knowledge is derived from sensual\nexperience, which implies that all knowledge is inductive. \nDeduction is the inverse process of induction, and both rely upon the\nnature of identity. \n3. Logic\n\n Like many other logicians of the 19th century, Jevons\nwants to establish clear links between mathematics and logic. He would\nlike to derive mathematics from logic, which is based on the Laws of\nThought, and in doing so he makes (a rather controversial) use of\nmathematical symbols when establishing his logical formalism.  Jevons\ndenotes terms by capital letters A, B, C,\netc. and their negative counterparts by small italic letters\na,b,c, etc. The relation of identity or sameness is\nrepresented by the sign \u2018=\u2019. The expression\n\u2018A ~ B\u2019 indicates that A and\nB are not identical with each other; \u2018A \u00a7\nB\u2019 indicates that there exists any relation between\nA and B, which includes but is not restricted to the\nrelations of equality or inequality. The general formula of logical\ninference implies that from A = B \u00a7 C\nwe can conclude that A \u00a7 C.  Jevons defines the\nconcept \u2018term\u2019 in his Pure Logic:\n\u201cTerm will be used to mean name, or any\ncombination of names and words describing the qualities and\ncircumstances of a thing\u201d. Jevons distinguishes between the\nextent and the intent of a term or a name. \u201cThe objects denoted\nform the extent of meaning of the term; the qualities implied\nform the intent of meaning\u201d. It follows that extent and\nintent of meaning are negatively correlated: when more qualities are\nadded to the meaning of a term, less objects will correspond to that\nmeaning. Abstract qualities, denoted by abstract terms, originate when\nobjects are compared and resemblances and differences\nidentified. Abstract terms possess only one kind of\nmeaning. Substantial terms, such as \u2018gold\u2019, denote\nsubstances. Nothing is denoted by the symbol \u20180\u2019, which in\nlogic means \u201cthe non-existent, the impossible, the\nself-inconsistent, the inconceivable\u201d. Jevons lists several\n\u201cspecial laws\u201d which govern the combination of terms.  The\n\u201cLaw of Simplicity\u201d implies that a term combined with\nitself has no effect, hence A = AA = AAA =\netc. The law of commutativeness indicates that the order of the\ncombination does not matter, hence AB = BA,\nABC = ACB = BCA = etc.\n\n The truths of science are expressed in the form of propositions. \n\u201cPropositions may assert an identity of time, space, manner,\nquantity, degree, or any other circumstance in which things may agree\nor differ\u201d (Jevons 1874: 36). Simple propositions A\n= B express the most elementary judgment regarding\nidentity. The use of the mathematical symbol \u2018=\u2019\nimplies that the distinction between subject and predicate vanishes,\nwhich makes quantification of the predicate possible. Several\nlogicians opted for what Jevons calls the \u201cindeterminate\nadjective\u201d \u2018some\u2019, represented symbolically by\n\u2018V\u2019. Jevons rejects the usage of indeterminate\nsymbols and suggests that A = VB (All As are\nsome Bs) should be written as A = AB. \nPropositions of this kind express an identity between a part of\nB and the whole of A.\n\n Direct inference consists of applying the \u2018substitution of\nsimilars\u2019 to certain premises in order to arrive at logical\nconclusions. Jevons lists several forms of inference:\n\nimmediate inference (A=B implies\nAC=BC);\ninference with two simple identities(B=A and\nB=C imply A=C);\nwith a simple and a partial identity(A = B and\nB = BC imply A = AC);\nof a partial from two partial identities(A = AB and\nB = BC imply A = ABC);\nof a simple from two partial identities(A = AB and\nB = AB imply A = B);\nof a limited from two partial identities(B = AB and\nB = CB imply AB = CB);\nand miscellaneous forms of deductive inference.\n\n\n Jevons indicates that traditional syllogistic forms such as Barbara,\nCelarent, Darii etc. can be represented easily in his logical\nsystem. It is also convenient to represent more complicated\ncases, such as inferences derived from more than two premises.\n\n\nDisjunctive propositions are used whenever an abstract term is\n\u2018developed\u2019 in its constituent parts or subclasses \u2013\nwhenever the extent of meaning of a term is explored. In order to\nrepresent disjunctive propositions, Jevons suggests to use the symbol\n\u2018\u00b7|\u00b7\u2019. The words \u2018and\u2019 and\n\u2018or\u2019, used in everyday language, can denote exclusive or\ninexclusive alternatives, but Jevons' symbol\n\u2018\u00b7|\u00b7\u2019 refers to alternatives that are not\nexclusive. The law of unity, A \u00b7|\u00b7 A =\nA, reveals an imperfect analogy between mathematics and\nlogic. In his earliest work on logic Jevons used the symbol\n\u2018+\u2019 instead of \u2018\u00b7|\u00b7\u2019, but in\nThe Principles of Science he recognises that the analogy\nbetween logic and mathematics is imperfect.  Contemporaries such\nas Boole and Robertson were very critical towards Jevons's use\nof mathematical symbols in logic.\n\n\nIndirect inference or indirect deduction consists of pointing out\n\u201cwhat a thing is, by showing that it cannot be anything\nelse\u201d. According to Jevons this is an important method, since\n\u201cnearly half our logical conclusions rest upon its\nemployment\u201d. The simplest form of indirect inference starts from\nA = AB. The law of duality implies that b =\nAb \u00b7|\u00b7 ab, or by substitution b =\nABb \u00b7|\u00b7 ab.  Since ABb = 0\n(a contradiction), it follows that b = ab. Hence, if\na metal is an element, it follows that a non-element is a\nnon-metal. Jevons refers to this conclusion as the\n\u201ccontrapositive proposition\u201d of the original. The\ncontrapositive of a simple identity A = B is\na = ab, and since A = B implies\nB = A it also follows that b =\nab. The two contrapositives taken together let us conclude\nthat a = b. The method of indirect inference can be\nused to describe a class of objects or a term, given certain\nconditions. The class is first of all \u2018developed\u2019 using\nthe law of duality, then alternative expressions taken from the\npremises are substituted, and finally all contradictory alternatives\nare scrapped. The remaining terms may be equated to the term in\nquestion.\n\n Jevons introduces the logical alphabet \u2013 a series of combinations\nthat can be formed with a given set of terms. For instance,\nA and B produce the four combinations AB,\nAb, aB and ab. Using the logical\nalphabet, logic becomes simply an exercise of fully developing all\nterms and eliminating the contradictory terms. However, when the\namount of letters increases, the amount of possible combinations\nbecomes considerable. Jevons considers some techniques and\ndevices to facilitate these endeavours, such as a \u2018Logical\nslate\u2019 (the logical alphabet engraved upon a school writing\nslate). Nevertheless, when more than six terms are involved, it\nbecomes almost impossible to solve the problem. To facilitate\nthis kind of reasoning Jevons developed a logical abacus, which\noperates on simple mechanical principles. It can be seen as one\nof the first computers.\n\n Induction is the inverse process of deduction, but it is a much more\ncomplicated mode of reasoning. Induction proceeds according to\ncertain rules of thumb, trial and error, and past attempts. \nInduction of simple identities becomes very complex as soon as more\nthan just a few terms are involved. Induction of partial\nidentities starts from a certain premise in disjunctive form A\n= B \u00b7|\u00b7 C \u00b7|\u00b7 D\n\u00b7|\u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7|\u00b7 P\n\u00b7|\u00b7 Q, and then we need propositions that\nascribe a certain property to all individuals: B =\nBX, C = CX, \u2026, Q =\nQX. Substituting and rearranging yield the desired\nresult A = AX. According to Jevons this is the\nmost important scientific procedure, as \u201ca great mass of\nscientific truths consists of propositions of this form A =\nAB\u201d. Jevons recognises the problem of induction \u2014\nthat we can never be sure to predict the future based on past\nknowledge. Jevons needs to bring in principles of number and\ntheory of probability to deal with this matter.\n4. Philosophy of Mathematics, Theory of Probability and Statistics\n\n Jevons' principles of number reflect his insistence that\nmathematics should be based on logic, not the other way round. He\noccupies a somewhat contradictory position in the history of logic,\nsince his formalism was inspired by the works of Boole, who gave\nmathematics priority over logic. Jevons attempts to define\n\u2018number\u2019 by counting \u2018units\u2019 in space or\ntime. When counting coins, every coin should receive a proper name: we\nshould count C\u2032 + C\u2033 +\nC\u2032\u2032\u2032 +\nC\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + \u2026  The coins are\nequal to each other (they all belong to the class C); they\nare different only because they reside on different points in\nspace. Before counting, we should reduce all identical alternatives;\nthe remaining \u2018units\u2019 reside on different points in space\nand time.  \u201cA unit is any object of thought which can be\ndiscriminated from every other object treated as a unit in the same\nproblem\u201d (Jevons 1874: 157). The concept of\n\u2018unit\u2019 encounters some severe difficulties, as noted by\nFrege. We can only add up Cs that are identical, but they\ncannot denote different things if the same symbol C is\nused. Jevons was unable to resolve this contradiction.\n\n Given these problems, the role and importance of Jevons' system\nof logic and philosophy of mathematics seems to be small. It\nappears to be limited to a pedagogical aspect: Jevons' writings\non logic, such as his Elementary Lessons in Logic, were widely\nused as textbooks and saw numerous reprints, up to decades after his\ndeath. This appraisal would not, however, do justice to\nJevons' most important achievement: the introduction of\nstatistics and econometrics in the social sciences and the use of\nempirical data.\n\n Statisticians in the first part of the 19th century were concerned\nwith the collection of data, but not with analysis. The data suggested\ntoo many different causes. Statistical journals published tables and\nnumbers, but graphical representations and analysis remained\nabsent. In 1863 Jevons published A Serious Fall in the Value of\nGold, which investigated the influence of Australian and\nCalifornian gold discoveries of 1851 on the value of gold. For this\npurpose he constructed index numbers making use of the geometric\nmean. He argued that multiplicative disturbances will be balanced off\nagainst each other when using the geometric mean. There is however no\nempirical verification of this \u2018multiplicative\ndisturbances\u2019 hypothesis. Aldrich (1987) argues that Jevons used\nprobability in two main patterns of argument: in the determination\nwhether events result from certain causes or are rather coincidences,\nand in the method of the least squares. The first approach entails the\napplication of the \u2018inverse method\u2019 in induction: if many\nobservations suggest regularity, then it becomes highly improbable\nthat these result from mere coincidence.   The second\napproach, the method of the least squares, appears when Jevons tries\nto adjudge weights to commodities (giving more weight to commodities\nthat are less vulnerable to price fluctuations), and when he tries to\nfit empirical laws starting from an a priori reasoning about the form\nof the equation. These methods show at least some concern for\nprobability and the theory of errors.   But Jevons worked on\nthe limits of his mathematical understanding, and many ideas that he\nforeshadowed were not developed until decades after his death.\n\n Jevons' use of statistics in the social sciences was inspired by\nAdolphe Quetelet. Jevons distinguishes between a\n\u2018mean\u2019 (the approximation of a definite existing quantity)\nand an \u2018average\u2019 or \u2018fictitious mean\u2019 (an\narithmetical average). The fictitious mean is important, since it\nallows us to \u2018conceive in a single result a multitude of\ndetails\u2019. For instance, Jevons equates aggregate and\naverage consumption: provided that the community under consideration is\nlarge enough, the average consumption of the aggregate community will\nvary continuously due to price changes, whereas individual behaviour is\nstrongly affected by accidents. If all individuals had exactly\nthe same features (those relevant for consumption), then the average\nlaws of supply and demand would be equal to the conduct of every\nindividual. If however the \u201cpowers, wants, habits, and\npossessions\u201d of different people were widely different, then the\naverage would not represent \u201cthe character of any existing\nthing\u201d. The accidents would cancel each other out and a\ncertain \u2018typical\u2019 consumer would emerge. Although\nthis is clearly a case of a fictitious mean, it would not be less\nuseful: \u201cthe movements of trade and industry depend upon averages\nand aggregates, not upon the whim of individuals\u201d.\n\n Jevons thus recognizes that people are not homogeneous and that it\nwould be wrong to create \u2018representative agents\u2019 depicting\nindividual behaviour. In the case of large aggregates however,\ndisturbing causes would cancel each other out. Here Jevons brings\nin the large number argument. If however specific policy\nquestions are at stake, the heterogeneity of different societal\nsubgroups has to be accounted for. Jevons uses the concept of\n\u2018character\u2019 in order to bridge the gap between universal\ntheory and characteristics of specific subgroups in society, as we will\nsee in the next section.\n5. Philosophy of Economics\n\n Jevons seems to be a mathematical, deductive economist. Market\nprices are derived directly from a series of fundamental motive forces,\nsuch as \u201cthe mechanics of utility and self-interest\u201d. Markets are\ndepicted in the most abstract fashion and economic agents are perfectly\nrational, perfectly foresighted and in possession of perfect\ninformation. A perfectly rational human being would anticipate\nfuture feelings and include discounted future utility in his\ncalculations. However, this ability varies according to certain\ncircumstances, as there are \u201cthe intellectual standing of the race, or\nthe character of the individual\u201d (Jevons 1879: 34). The ability\nof foresight depends on the state of civilisation: the class or race\nwith the most foresight will work most for the future, because a\npowerful feeling for the future is the main incentive to industry and\nsaving. Moreover, even the \u2018quality\u2019 of tastes increases with\nevery improvement of civilisation. Jevons' conception of an\neconomic agent should therefore be altered according to the\ninstitutional setting in which the agent appears (the class or race to\nwhich the individual belongs).\n\n Michael White elaborates on Jevons' use of the concepts of\n\u2018character\u2019 (White 1994a), \u2018gender\u2019 (White\n1994b) and \u2018race\u2019 (White 1993). Jevons' work was not\ndirected to the explanation of the behaviour of specific individuals\nper se, unless these individuals were representative for all market\nparticipants of a certain uniform character. The science of economics\ndeals with the lowest motives, and the Theory contains\n\u2018representative individuals\u2019, which behave in the way\nrequired by the Theory. All economic actors do not have to\nbehave in exactly the same way, but disturbing causes would balance\nand therefore the \u2018representative individual\u2019 may be an\nappropriate model for the Theory. The theory is however\nindeterminate in cases when more information is required. For example,\nit is unclear whether an increase in the real wage rate, proportionate\nto an increase in labour productivity, results in increased or reduced\nhours of work. More information about the \u2018character\u2019 of\nthe person under consideration is required: whereas learned\nprofessionals might be expected to work more severely, common\nlabourers might prefer idleness over labour and prefer greater\n\u2018ease\u2019 in the case of rising real incomes. Irish labourers\nare said to be responsible for the higher mortality rates in several\ndistricts, because Jevons considered the Irish to be a race that would\nbecome more easily subject to drunkenness. The proper place of women\nis the home: women with children younger than three years should not\nbe allowed to work, as this would only give rise no a neglect of the\nchildren, and would encourage the males to choose for idleness. In all\nthese cases, the characters of labourers, Irish people or women are\ntaken for granted, and are not in need of further explanation. The\nVictorian middle-class is used as a yardstick for evaluation.\n6. Unitarianism and Evolutionism\n\n\nAlthough the bias regarding class, gender and race is obvious in\nJevons' work,  we should add that he was concerned with the\namelioration of society in general and the condition of the working\nclasses in particular. This attitude was inspired by the\nprogressive and Unitarian middle-class background from which Jevons\nemerged. Some remarks and reflections on religion can be found in\nhis diary and personal correspondence. \n\n\nAlthough Jevons does not discuss explicitly the Trinity, it is clear\nthat he believes in the existence of one God. He does not\ndescribe him as a personal being or father, but as a general principle\nof abstract goodness (Black 1973: 258). This abstract principle\nis in perfect accordance with scientific findings: he reports that his\nconception of God is derived from an examination of matter and\nmind. The world is a \u201cvast organism\u201d with order and\nform expressing intention and mind, which implies that God is\ninseparable from his works. He is visible \u201cin the wonderful\norder and simplicity of Nature, in the adaptation of means to ends, and\nin the creation of man to which everything refers, with power capable\nof indefinite improvement\u201d (Black & K\u00f6nekamp 1972:\n155). Jevons founds his faith \u201con Man and his\nfeelings\u201d, because humanity\u2019s mental feelings of love and\nsympathy are the only places where intentions of good can be\ndiscovered. Every religion refers to the same eternal principles\nor \u201cmoral truths\u201d, but the state of civilization determines\ntheir degree of misrepresentation. Different religions are merely\ncostumes thrown over these principles, and Unitarianism contains the\n\u201cmost simple and truth-like\u201d set of religious\nbeliefs. God is depicted as a principle of abstract goodness, and\nJesus is seen as the messenger who brought the eternal moral truths to\nhumankind. Whereas Newton was a genius of natural science and\nMozart of music, Jesus was a moral genius. The history of\nUnitarianism is also the history of a rational approach to religion,\nand a critical approach to the Holy Scripture. In general,\nUnitarians did not oppose scientific development, but on the contrary\nthey argued that science and religion should be seen as two sides of\nthe same coin.\n\n\nThe growing critical attitude of Unitarianism coincides historically\nwith the rise of evolutionary theory: especially Darwinism, but also\nwider theory such as the work of Auguste Comte and Herbert\nSpencer. Jevons was particularly favourable towards\nSpencer\u2019s evolutionary ethics. The evolutionary perspective\nallows Jevons to integrate his religious beliefs in a view on the world\nas growing towards higher moral consciousness and rationality. \nLike Spencer, Jevons argues that there is no conflict at all between\nscience and religion. On the contrary: they are both directed\ntowards truth, and therefore they cannot contradict each other. \nJevons congratulated John Herschel for his condemnation of the\nTheological Declaration of Scientific Man, which equated freedom of\ninquiry with a tendency to irreligion (Black 1977a: 60). Jevons\neven intended to write the Tenth Bridgewater Treatise (following\nCharles Babbage\u2019s Ninth Bridgewater Treatise) to show the perfect\ncompatibility between science and religion, but he never completed this\nwork.\n\n\nIn The Principles of Science Jevons devotes a (short)\nsection on the theory of evolution, followed by a section on the\npossibility of divine interference (Jevons 1874, pp. \n761\u20139). Jevons embraces Spencer\u2019s idea that the homogenous\nis unstable and differentiates itself in the process of evolutionary\ndevelopment. This explains why a variety of human institutions\nand characters emerged. He recognizes that evolutionary theory\nhas not been proved, but nevertheless he adheres to its\ntruthfulness. It is certainly not in conflict with theology,\nsince it does not lead to the conclusion that creation was and is\nimpossible. Evolutionary theory discloses several natural laws\nthat explain how primitive life evolved to humankind by processes of\nadaptation to changing circumstances \u2014 but the initial\ndistribution of atoms in the primeval world is very important as\nwell. Jevons argues that this initial distribution is the result\nof the \u201carbitrary choice of the Creator\u201d, which could have\nbeen very different and therefore present life would have been very\ndifferent as well. Evolutionary theory tells us only that similar\ncircumstances will lead to similar results since the same laws apply,\nbut this is not in conflict with an initial act of creation. In\nclose accordance with Spencer\u2019s First Principles, Jevons\nstates that it would be absurd to deny that anything exists, and that\nit therefore might be equally conceivable that the world was created\nout of nothing or that it existed from eternity. He also states\nclearly that science cannot disprove the possibility of divine\nintervention, which implies that a positivist attitude does not\nnecessarily lead to materialism or atheism. Jevons also takes\ndistance from Comte\u2019s positivistic philosophy, by arguing \u2014\nlike Spencer \u2014 that scientific reflection on higher notions of\ncreation must necessarily end up in contradictions.\n7. Implications for Economic and Social Policy\n\n\nBlack (1995) recognizes that, after 1867, Jevons'\n\u201cincreasing faith in the validity of Spencer\u2019s theory of\nevolution was combined with decreasing faith in the validity of\nlaissez-faire as a guide for economic policy\u201d. Unitarians\nstruggled with the \u2018contradiction\u2019 between the need for\nindividual self-improvement on the one hand, and active interventionism\non the other hand. This \u2018contradiction\u2019 can also be\ndepicted as a tension existing between a belief in scientific\nprinciples on the one hand \u2014 the laws of economics \u2014 and\nthe recognition that moral and intellectual self-improvement is\nimpossible as long as the first necessaries of life are still out of\nreach. Unitarians concluded that a rational mode of living had to\nbe imposed on the poor before they could benefit from education. \nJevons tried to resolve this paradox by restricting the scientific\nanalysis to what can be accounted for in terms of the accumulation of\nwealth, and by suggesting that a \u2018higher\u2019 calculus of\npleasures and pains is needed when \u2018higher\u2019 motives\ninterfere. Interventionism could then be justified by pointing\nout those \u2018higher\u2019 motives. The scientific basis of\nJevons' economics is utilitarianism and the mechanics of utility\nand self-interest; like many Unitarians this scientific belief is\ncombined with an emphasis on active interventionism directed towards\nmore possibilities for self-improvement; and evolutionary theory does\nnot only show that there should be development towards the\n\u2018good\u2019 and the \u2018happy\u2019, but also that there\nwill be such a development (at least in Jevons'\ninterpretation). \n\n\nMaterial nature does not contain goodness; it can only be found in\nthe human mind. Nature is depicted as a mechanical machine and\nshould be studied by the natural sciences. Abstract economic\ntheory is the mechanical analogy of these natural sciences: it is\nrestricted to an investigation of the social world as a mechanical\nmachine, and no ethical or religious considerations are taken into\naccount. Jevons refutes the claims of some \u201csentimental\nwriters\u201d who regard economics as a \u201cdismal science\u201d,\nbecause its scope is restricted to wealth. These authors depict\neconomics as a mechanical and miserable body of theories, whereas they\nhold true that a moral science should be concerned with sympathies,\nfeelings and duties. Jevons uses an analogy from the natural\nsciences to refute this opinion: division of labour implies that some\npeople investigate the mechanical aspects of iron, while other\nresearchers devote their time to the study of its electrical or\nmagnetic aspects. A physician may conclude that the health of a\nparticular person will be fostered if he goes to the sea, but this\nperson may decide otherwise by taking other considerations into\naccount. This is the position of economics: charity for\nhumanitarian reasons remains possible, but abstract economic theory\nshows that this may endanger future accumulation of wealth (Black\n1977d, pp. 7\u20138).\n\n\nEarlier we discussed Jevons' use of \u2018representative\nindividuals\u2019 and the notion of \u2018character\u2019. It\nis also the case that Unitarians believe that the formation of an\nimproved character is essential, since otherwise no religious warmth\ncan emerge. It is unclear to what extent improvement of people\nwith presumed inferior character (due to class, race or gender) can be\ndone. In Jevons we encounter a mixture of enlightened belief in\neducation and prejudiced opinions against certain parts of the\npopulation, which is certainly not unusual for the 19th\ncentury. Nevertheless, Jevons does believe that policies to\nameliorate working class conditions and attitudes are possible,\ndesirable and required.\n",
