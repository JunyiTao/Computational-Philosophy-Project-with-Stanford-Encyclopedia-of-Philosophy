Perception is reduced to dispositions\nand causes. (See, for instance, \u201cVeridical Hallucination and\nProsthetic Vision\u201d (1980d).) We discussed the reduction of\nmental content to dispositions and causes in section 4. And we\ndiscussed the reduction of linguistic content to mental content in\nsection 1. Values are reduced to mental states in \u201cDispositional\nTheories of Value\u201d (1989b).\n\nBut we might worry about the very foundation of the project. We\nstarted with the assumption that our subvenient base consists of\nintrinsic properties of point-sized objects and spatiotemporal\nrelations. But Bell\u2019s inequality suggests that modern physics\nrequires, as primitive, other relations between objects. (Or it\nrequires intrinsic properties of dispersed objects.) So Humean\nsupervenience fails in this world.\n\nLewis\u2019s response is somewhat disarming. Writing in 1986, part of\nhis response is scepticism about the state of quantum mechanics.\n(There is notably less scepticism in \u201cHow Many Lives Has\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat\u201d (2004b).) But the larger part of\nhis response is to suggest that scientific challenges to Humean\nsupervenience are outside his responsibility.\n\nReally, what I uphold is not so much the truth of Humean supervenience\nas the tenability of it. If physics itself were to teach me\nthat it is false, I wouldn\u2019t grieve ... What I want to fight are\nphilosophical arguments against Humean supervenience. When\nphilosophers claim that one or another common-place feature of the\nworld cannot supervene on the arrangement of qualities, I make it my\nbusiness to resist. Being a commonsensical fellow (except where\nunactualized possible worlds are concerned) I will seldom deny that\nthe features in question exist. I grant their existence, and do my\nbest to show how they can, after all, supervene on the arrangement of\nqualities. (1986b: xi)\n\n\nWe might wonder why Lewis found this such an interesting\nproject. If physics teaches that Humean supervenience is false, why\ncare whether there are also philosophical objections to it? There are\ntwo (related) reasons why we might care.\n\nRecall that we said that Humean supervenience is a conjunction of\nseveral theses. One of these is a thesis about which perfectly natural\nproperties are instantiated in this world, namely local ones. That\nthesis is threatened by modern physics. But the rest of the package,\narguably, is not. In particular, the thesis that all facts supervene\non the distribution of perfectly natural properties and relations does\nnot appear to be threatened. (Though see Maudlin (2007: Ch. 2) for a\ndissenting view.) Nor is the thesis that perfectly natural properties\nand relations satisfy a principle of recombination threatened by\nmodern physics. The rough idea of the principle of recombination is\nthat any distribution of perfectly natural properties is possible.\nThis thesis is Lewis\u2019s version of the Humean principle that\nthere are no necessary connections between distinct existences, and\nLewis is determined to preserve as strong a version of it as he\ncan.\n\nAlthough physics does not seem to challenge these two theses, several\nphilosophers do challenge them on distinctively philosophical grounds.\nSome of them suggest that the nomic, the intensional, or the normative\ndo not supervene on the distribution of perfectly natural properties.\nOthers suggest that the nomic,\n intentional,\n or normative properties are perfectly natural, and as a consequence\nperfectly natural properties are not freely recombinable. The\nphilosophical arguments in favour of such positions rarely turn on the\nprecise constitution of the Humean\u2019s preferred subvenient base.\nIf Lewis can show that such arguments fail in the setting of classical\nphysics, then he\u2019ll have refuted all of the arguments against\nHumean superveience that don\u2019t rely on the details of modern\nphysics. In practice that means he\u2019ll have refuted many, though\nnot quite all, of the objections to Humean supervenience.\n\nA broader reason for Lewis to care about Humean supervenience comes\nfrom looking at his overall approach to metaphysics. When faced with\nsomething metaphysically problematic, say\n free will,\n there are three broad approaches. Some philosophers will argue that\nfree will can\u2019t be located in a scientific world-view, so it\nshould be eliminated. Call these \u2018the eliminativists\u2019.\nSome philosophers will agree that free will can\u2019t be located in\nthe scientific world-view, so that\u2019s a reason to expand our\nmetaphysical picture to include free will, perhaps as a new primitive.\nCall these \u2018the expansionists\u2019. And some philosophers will\nreject the common assumption of an incompatibility. Instead they will\nargue that we can have free will without believing in anything that\nisn\u2019t in the scientific picture. Call these \u2018the\ncompatibilists\u2019.\n\nAs the above quote makes clear, Lewis was a compatibilist about most\nquestions in metaphysics. He certainly was one about free will.\n(\u201cAre We Free to Break the Laws?\u201d (1981a).) And he was a\ncompatibilist about most nomic, intentional and normative concepts.\nThis wasn\u2019t because he had a global argument for compatibilism.\nIndeed, he was an eliminativist about religion (\u201cAnselm and\nActuality\u201d (1970a), \u201cDivine Evil\u201d (2007)). And in\nsome sense he was an expansionist about modality. Lewis may have\ncontested this; he thought introducing more worlds did not increase\nthe number of kinds of things in our ontology, because we are already\ncommitted to there being at least one world. As Melia (1992: 192)\npoints out though, the inhabitants of those worlds include all kinds\nof things not found in, or reducible to, fundamental physics. They\ninclude spirits, gods, trolls and every other consistent beast\nimaginable. So at least when it came to what there is, as opposed to\nwhat there actually is, Lewis\u2019s ontology was rather\nexpansionist.\n\nFor all that, Lewis\u2019s default attitude was to accept that much\nof our common-sense thinking about the nomic, the intentional and the\nnormative was correct, and that this was perfectly compatible with\nthis world containing nothing more than is found in science, indeed\nthan is found in fundamental physics.\n\nCompatibilists should solve what Frank Jackson calls \u2018the\nlocation problem\u2019 (Jackson 1998). If you think that there are,\nsay, beliefs, and you think that having beliefs in one\u2019s\nmetaphysics doesn\u2019t commit you to having anything in your\nontology beyond fundamental physics, then you should, as Jackson puts\nit, be able to locate beliefs in the world described by\nfundamental physics. More generally, for whatever you accept, you\nshould be able to locate it in the picture of the world you\naccept.\n\nThis was certainly the methodology that Lewis accepted. And since he\nthought that so much of our common sense worldview was compatible with\nfundamental physics, he had many versions of the location problem to\nsolve. One way to go about this would be to find exactly what the\ncorrect scientific theory is, and locate all the relevant properties\nin that picture. But this method has some shortcomings. For one thing,\nit might mean having to throw out your metaphysical work whenever the\nscientific theories change. For another, it means having your\nmetaphysics caught up in debates about the best scientific theories,\nand about their interpretation. So Lewis took a somewhat different\napproach.\n\nWhat Lewis\u2019s defence of Humean supervenience gives us is a\nrecipe for locating the nomic, intentional and normative properties in\na physical world. And it is a recipe that uses remarkably few\ningredients; just intrinsic properties of point-sized objects, and\nspatio-temporal relations. It is likely that ideal physics will have\nmore in it than that. For instance, it might have entanglement\nrelations, as are needed to explain Bell\u2019s inequality. But it is\nunlikely to have less. And the more there is in fundamental physics,\nthe easier it is to solve the location problem, because the\nwould-be locator has more resources to work with.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that a philosophical defence of Humean\nsupervenience, especially a defence like Lewis\u2019s that shows us\nexplicitly how to locate various folk properties in classical physics,\nis likely to show us how to locate those properties in more up-to-date\nphysics. So Lewis\u2019s defence of Humean supervenience then\ngeneralises into a defence of the compatibility of large swathes of\nfolk theory with ideal physics. And the defence is consistent with the\nrealist principle that truth supervenes on being, and with the Humean\ndenial of necessary connections between distinct existences. And that,\nquite clearly, is a philosophically interesting project.\n6. Modal Realism\n\nThis entry has been stressing Lewis\u2019s many and diverse\ncontributions to philosophy. But there is one thesis with which he is\nassociated above all others: modal realism. Lewis held that this world\nwas just one among many like it. A proposition, p is possibly\ntrue if and only if p is true in one of these worlds.\nRelatedly, he held that individuals like you or I (or this computer)\nonly exist in one possible world. So what it is for a proposition like\nYou are happy to be true in another world is not for you to\nbe happy in that world; you aren\u2019t in that world. Rather, it is\nfor your counterpart to be happy in that world.\n\nLewis wrote about modal realism in many places. As early as\nCounterfactuals he wrote this famous passage.\n\nI believe, and so do you, that things could have been different in\ncountless ways. But what does this mean? Ordinary language permits the\nparaphrase: there are many ways things could have been besides the way\nthey actually are. I believe that things could have been different in\ncountless ways; I believe permissible paraphrases of what I believe;\ntaking the paraphrase at its face value, I therefore believe in the\nexistence of entities that might be called \u2018ways things could\nhave been.\u2019 I prefer to call them \u2018possible worlds.\u2019\n(1973a: 84)\n\n\nAnd Lewis used counterpart theory throughout his career to resolve\nmetaphysical puzzles in fields stretching from\n personal identity\n (\u201cCounterparts of Persons and Their Bodies\u201d (1971c)) to\n truthmaker theory\n (\u201cThings qua Truthmakers\u201d (2003b)). Indeed, Lewis\u2019s\noriginal statement of counterpart theory is in one of his first\npublished metaphysics papers (\u201cCounterpart Theory and Quantified\nModal Logic\u201d (1968)).\n\nBut the canonical statement and defence of both modal realism and\ncounterpart theory is in On the Plurality of Worlds (1986a),\nthe book that grew out of his 1984 John Locke lectures. This section\nwill follow the structure of that book.\n\nThe little \u2018argument by paraphrase\u2019 from\nCounterfactuals is a long way from an argument for\nLewis\u2019s form of modal realism. For one thing, the argument\nrelies on taking a folksy paraphrase as metaphysically revealing;\nperhaps we would be better off treating this as just a careless manner\nof speaking. For another, the folksy paraphrase Lewis uses isn\u2019t\nobviously innocuous; like many other abstraction principles it could\nbe hiding a contradiction. And the argument does little to show that\nother possible worlds are concreta; talking of them as ways things\ncould be makes them sound like properties, which are arguably\nabstracta if they exist at all. The first three chapters of\nPlurality address these three issues. The fourth chapter is\nan extended discussion of the place of individuals in modal realism.\nWe\u2019ll look at these chapters in order.\n",
