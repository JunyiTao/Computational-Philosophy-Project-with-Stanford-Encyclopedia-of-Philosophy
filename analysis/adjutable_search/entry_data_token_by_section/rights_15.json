    "main_text": "Critiques of Rights\n7. Critiques of Rights\n\nCritiques of rights come in two forms. The first is an attack on the\nsubstance of doctrines that give rights a central place. These\ncritiques allege that the content of such doctrines is, in one way or\nother, malformed or unjustified. Here we find, for example, the\ncriticism that natural rights doctrines are \u201cso much flat\nassertion,\u201d or that utilitarian rights tend to be implausibly\nweak. The second form of critique attacks the language of rights\nitself. The objection here is that it is inappropriate or\ncounterproductive to express at least some kinds of normative concerns\nin terms of rights. We should, according to the second form of\ncritique, reduce or avoid \u201crights talk.\u201d\n",
