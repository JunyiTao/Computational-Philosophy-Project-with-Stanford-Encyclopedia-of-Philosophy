    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism || Rule Utilitarianism\n2.8 Rule Utilitarianism\n\nBut not everyone agrees. J.O. Urmson famously defended a rule\nutilitarian reading of Mill (1953). One of Urmson\u2019s reasons for\nthis rule utilitarian reading appeals to Mill\u2019s reliance on\nvarious rules and secondary principles in moral reasoning. We will\nexamine that rationale shortly. But Urmson also appeals to the\nProportionality Doctrine as requiring a rule utilitarian\ninterpretation of Mill.\n2.8.1 Felicific Tendencies\n\nRecall that the Proportionality Doctrine says, in part, that\nutilitarianism holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend\nto promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of\nhappiness (U II 2). Urmson claims that we can make sense of\nan action\u2019s tendency to produce good or bad consequences only as\na claim about what is true of a class or type of\nactions. Token actions produce specifiable consequences; only types of\nactions have tendencies. On Urmson\u2019s interpretation, Mill is\nreally saying that an action is right if it is a token of a type of\nact that tends to have good or optimal consequences. So interpreted,\nthe Proportionality Doctrine would espouse a form of rule\nutilitarianism.\n\nBut it was common among the Philosophical Radicals to formulate\nutilitarianism, as the Proportionality Doctrine does, in terms of the\nfelicific tendencies of individual actions. For instance, Bentham does\nthis early in his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation.\n\n\nBy the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or\ndisapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency\nwhich it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the\nparty whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in\nother words, to promote or oppose that happiness. I say of every\naction whatsoever; and therefore not only every action of a private\nindividual, but of every measure of government. (I 2; also see I 3,\n6)\n\n\nHere and elsewhere, Bentham clearly ascribes the felicific tendency to\naction tokens, and he equates an action\u2019s felicific tendency\nwith the extent to which it promotes utility.\n\n\nThe general tendency of an act is more or less pernicious, according\nto the sum total of its consequences: that is, according to the\ndifferences between the sum of such as are good, and the sum of such\nas are evil. (VII 2; also see IV 5)\n\n\nIf we interpret Mill\u2019s Proportionality Doctrine against the\nbackground of similar claims made by Bentham, this is evidence against\nUrmson\u2019s reading and in favor of an act utilitarian reading of\nthe Proportionality Doctrine (see Berger 1984: 73\u201378).\n2.8.2 Secondary Principles\n\nUrmson also defends a rule utilitarian interpretation as a reading of\nMill\u2019s claims about the importance of secondary principles in\nour moral reasoning. Mill defends the utilitarian\u2019s appeal to\nfamiliar moral precepts about such things as fidelity, veracity, and\nfair play as secondary principles that should regulate much moral\nreasoning (U II 24\u201325). He seems to believe that\nsecondary principles often satisfy two conditions.\n\nFollowing the principle generally but imperfectly leads to optimal\nresults.\nThe suboptimal results that adherence to the principle produces\ncannot be identified reliably and efficiently in advance.\n\n\nWhen these two conditions are met, Mill believes, agents should for\nthe most part follow these principles automatically and without\nrecourse to the utilitarian first principle. However, they should\nperiodically step back and review, as best they can, whether the\nprinciple continues to satisfy conditions (1) and (2). Also, they\nshould set aside these secondary principles and make direct appeal to\nthe principle of utility in unusual cases in which it is especially\nclear that the effects of adhering to the principle would be\nsubstantially suboptimal and in cases in which secondary principles,\neach of which has a utilitarian justification, conflict (II 19,\n24\u201325).\n\nRegulating one\u2019s behavior in this way by secondary principles,\nMill believes, is what will best promote happiness, as he explains in\nA System of Logic.\n\n\nI do not mean to assert that the promotion of happiness should be\nitself the end of all actions, or even all rules of action. It is the\njustification, and ought to be the controller, of all ends, but it is\nnot itself the sole end. There are many virtuous actions, and even\nvirtuous modes of action (though the cases are, I think, less frequent\nthan is often supposed) by which happiness in the particular instance\nis sacrificed, more pain being produced than pleasure. But conduct of\nwhich this can be truly asserted, admits of justification only because\nit can be shown that on the whole more happiness will exist in the\nworld, if feelings are cultivated which will make people, in certain\ncases, regardless of happiness. (SL VI.xii.7)\n\n\nHe makes similar claims in his essay \u201cOn Bentham\u201d\n(CW X: 110\u201311).\n\nMill\u2019s utilitarian justification of secondary principles is\nintended as a contrast with the intuitionism of William Whewell and\nothers. As he makes clear in his essay \u201cWhewell on Moral\nPhilosophy\u201d(CW X), Mill thinks that the intuitionist\nwrongly treats familiar moral precepts as ultimate moral factors whose\njustification is supposed to be self-evident. By contrast,\nMill\u2019s account of secondary principles recognizes their\nimportance in moral reasoning but insists that they are neither innate\nnor infallible; they are precepts that have been adopted and\ninternalized because of their acceptance value, and their continued\nuse should be suitably regulated by their ongoing comparative\nacceptance value. Far from undermining utilitarian first principles,\nMill thinks, appeal to the importance of such moral principles\nactually provides support for utilitarianism.\n\nWhether Mill\u2019s claims about the importance of secondary\nprinciples imply rule utilitarianism depends, in part, on whether he\nwants to define right action in terms of the best set of secondary\nprinciples or whether they are just a reliable way of doing what is in\nfact best. If he defines right action in terms of conformity with\nprinciples with optimal acceptance value, then he is a rule\nutilitarian. But if the right action is the best action, and secondary\nprinciples are just a reliable (though imperfect) way of identifying\nwhat is best, then Mill is an act utilitarian. Mill appears to address\nthis issue in two places. In Chapter II of Utilitarianism\nMill appears to suggest that in the case of abstinences or taboos the\nground of the obligation in particular cases is the beneficial\ncharacter of the taboo considered as a class (II 19). But in a letter\nto John Venn Mill claims that the moral status of an individual action\ndepends on the utility of its consequences; considerations about the\nutility of a general class of actions are just defeasible evidence\nabout what is true in particular cases (CW XVII: 1881).\nUnfortunately, natural readings of the two passages point in opposite\ndirections on this issue, and each passage admits of alternative\nreadings.\n\nWithout clear support for the rule utilitarian reading of secondary\nprinciples, it seems that Mill\u2019s main claims about secondary\nprinciples are not inconsistent with act utilitarianism. Moreover, it\nis clear that Mill thinks we need to depart from otherwise justified\nsecondary principles in an important range of cases. Though Mill does\nnot treat secondary principles as mere rules of thumb in utilitarian\ncalculation, he does not think that they should be followed\nuncritically or independently of their consequences. He thinks that\nthey should be set aside in favor of direct appeal to the principle of\nutility when following them would be clearly suboptimal or when there\nis a conflict among secondary principles.\n",
