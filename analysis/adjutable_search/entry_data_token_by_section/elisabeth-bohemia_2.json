    "main_text": "Intellectual Networks\n3. Intellectual Networks\n\nIn addition to her well-known correspondence with Descartes, discussed\nin detail below, Elisabeth also had other extensive correspondence,\nnow documented in Ebbersmeyer (2020). Through this correspondence\nscholars are beginning to gain a sense of her intellectual\nnetworks.\n\nElisabeth corresponded with a number of prominent Quakers, including\nRobert Barclay and William Penn, who visited her at the convent in\nHerford. Though both Barclay and Penn attempt to gain Elisabeth as a\nconvert, she does not seem interested in engaging them philosophically\nor theologically. Insofar as the Scottish Quakers played a strategic\nrole in the efforts to restore the throne, one can wonder whether her\nengagement with them was simply political. On the other hand,\nElisabeth\u2019s long-standing interest in emerging alternative theories,\nalong with her interest in divine providence, makes it just as\nplausible that she took a more intellectual interest in their world\nview.\n\nHutton (2021) explores Elisabeth\u2019s connections to the Quakers in\nmore detail, through her correspondence with Robert Barclay and George\nKeith, and aims to ascertain whether Elisabeth and Anne Conway knew\none another through those connections, as well as her connections with\nHenry More, the Hartlib Circle, and Francis Mercury van Helmont, De\nBaar (2021) considers Elisabeth\u2019s interest in religion more\ngenerally through her correspondence with Anna Maria van Schurman.\n\nPal (2021) focuses on Elisabeth\u2019s family correspondence, as well\nas her exchanges with Descartes and others, to argue that the\noverarching concern of Elisabeth\u2019s intellectual interests was\nthe question of how best to rule.\n\nEbbersmeyer (2021), drawing on correspondence and on dedications of\nbooks, demonstrates Elisabeth\u2019s awareness of and potential\ninvolvement in a number of areas of natural philosophy, including\nmathematics, medicine, microscopy, astronomy, and physics. Ebbersmeyer\ngoes on to explore the details of Elisabeth\u2019s interest in\nastronomy through her exchanges with Constantijn Huygens and Andreas\nColvius, and to show that Elisabeth was involved in debates about the\ndiscovery of the moons of Jupiter, emerging maps of the moon of Earth,\nand the invention of new telescopes.\n",
