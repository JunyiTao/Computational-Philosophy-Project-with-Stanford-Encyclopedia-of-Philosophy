    "main_text": "Early Epistemology\n3. Early Epistemology\n\n\nEmerging from the tradition of the philosophical physicists,\nSchlick\u2019s early thought bears the marks of his intellectual\nlegacy. After the completion of his graduate study in physics,\nSchlick soon turned his attention to philosophy (Schlick 2006a). \nWithin a few short years he had written a youthfully enthusiastic\nethical tract in 1908, called Lebensweisheit, a lucid analysis\nof concept-formation called \u201cThe Boundaries of Scientific and\nPhilosophical Concept-Formation\u201d (1910), as well as a substantial\nessay on \u201cThe Nature of Truth in Modern Logic\u201d (1910)\n(Schlick 2006b; Schlick 1979a, 25\u201340, 41\u2013103). In \u201cThe\nBoundaries\u2026\u201d, Schlick provided a broad sketch of his\nunderstanding of scientific thought, which identifies the aim of\nscience as the reduction of phenomena to relationships governed by law,\nthus exhibiting individual events as special cases of universal,\nexceptionless regularities. Science is expressed mathematically, in\nspatio-temporal form to provide for exact measurement. And the\nindividual sciences are demarcated by distinctive intensive qualities,\nas \u2018mass\u2019 distinguishes mechanics, \u2018heat\u2019\nthermodynamics, etc. Although the methods of mathematico-scientific\nconcept-formation reduces the entire natural world to purely\nquantitative relations, it is powerless in the face of irreducible pure\nqualities. This is the task of philosophy so that philosophy\nbecomes the theory of qualities. Schlick\u2019s work on\n\u201cThe Nature of Truth in Modern Logic\u201d not only provides a\nbroad survey of treatments of truth then current in German philosophy,\nbut it also introduces an original view of truth as univocal\ndesignation. A judgment, as a structured complex of its\nconstituents, is coordinated with the fact which consists of the\nentities signified by the judgment\u2019s constituents, arranged in a\nway which is coordinated with the structure of the particular\njudgment. When the constituents are structured in a judgment so\nthat the whole judgment univocally designates a situation in the world,\nthen the judgment is true; otherwise, it is false. The conception\nof truth as univocal coordination figured prominently in\nSchlick\u2019s pre-Positivist theory of knowledge.\n\n\nThe centerpiece of Schlick\u2019s early epistemology is a deep\ncleavage between intuitive acquaintance and conceptual knowledge. \nAlthough Schlick\u2019s distinction is reminiscent of Kant\u2019s\ncontrast between intuitions and concepts, Schlick regarded intuition as\nfully naturalized, much as Helmholtz had. When the elements of\njudgments are initially identified, they are grasped qualitatively, as\nsensory impressions, like the visual image of a particular dog or the\nmemory image of a horse. These intuitions of acquaintance\nare spatially qualitative, since they are not only extended but\nsituated with respect to one another in the space of the particular\nsensory modality through which they are perceived. They are also\ntemporal, since they succeed one another in time. For an example,\nSchlick considered the visual image of something in the distance which,\nas it approaches, is identified, first of all, as an animal, then it is\nrecognized as a dog and, when it comes close enough, it will be\nrecognized as my dog \u2018Fritz\u2019. Each of these cases\ninvolves the recognition of one thing \u2013 the image of that which is\napproaching \u2013 as something else, an animal, a dog, and (finally)\nFritz. Thus, each of these cases involves knowledge that the\nimage is that of an instance of some class (Schlick 1979a, 119\u2013121;\nSchlick 2009, Sec. 2). And the same process, in which one thing is\nrecognized as another and therefore known, occurs in cases of\nscientific knowledge. For instance, the early explanations of\nlight recognized that its behavior was much the same as the behavior of\nwaves. Thus, in the work of Christian Huyghens, light came to be\nknown as a wave phenomenon or, in other words, as the wave-like\npropagation of a state. Later, through the work of Heinrich\nHertz, it was realized that light was unlike mechanical waves which\ntraveled through a medium (such as water or air) but, rather, light\nbehaved more like electrical waves. Accordingly, light became\nknown as an electromagnetic wave phenomenon. In this case, as in\nthe everyday case of the knowledge that the approaching animal is my\ndog Fritz, light was originally known as a wave phenomenon and only\nlater did it become known as an undulatory disturbance in an\nelectromagnetic field (Schlick 1979a, 121\u20132; Schlick 2009, Sec.\n3).\n\n\nIn the early stages of everyday knowing, what is re-discovered or\nrecognized when something is known is an intuitive idea.  Intuitive\nideas present images which are signs of their contents and are drawn\nfrom sensory experience. Of course, images are vague, blurred, and\nill-defined so that when one conjures up an image, say, of one\u2019s\nfather, the expression on his face may not be clear and distinct, so that it\nmay be impossible to tell whether he is frowning or merely looking\npuzzled (Schlick 1979a, 126\u20137; Schlick 2009, Sec.  4). And while\nintuitive ideas are sufficient for the purposes of everyday life,\nscientific inquiry naturally demands more rigorous methods for\ncapturing and expressing ideas. For this reason, concepts \u2013\nideas with precisely delineated contents \u2013 are used. And while\nthe meanings of terms used in everyday discourse are usually intuitive\nideas, in science they are almost exclusively concepts. This provides\nscientific judgments with content which is accurately circumscribed,\nwhile at the same time eliminating their intuitive content. In\nhis General Theory of Knowledge of 1918, Schlick explained\nthat concepts are formed in clusters, just as the primitive concepts\nof a mathematical field are defined in terms of one another by the\naxioms of the discipline. But in his earlier epistemological writings,\nhe explains concept-formation in a more traditional fashion, by\nreference to marks or characteristics (Merkmale) which belong\nto all the objects which fall under the concept. Concepts thus\nrepresent classes of objects, defined in terms of determinate traits,\nso that their scope is exactly demarcated. Thus they differ from\nintuitions, which are indistinct representations of what is presented\nto a particular sensory modality. So the intuition of a triangle in\ngeneral or a man in general can only be a hazy, fuzzy-edged visual\nrepresentation of some particular triangle or man. And while everyday\nknowing proceeds by comparisons of intuitions, scientific knowledge\nreplaces intuitions in these comparisons with precisely delineated\nconcepts. In short, it is through its reliance on concepts that\nscientific thinking takes knowledge to a higher level than everyday\nknowing.\n\n\nThus, in his earliest philosophical writings Schlick introduced an\ninnovative conception of truth as univocal designation and affirmed a\ncontrast between intuitions and concepts which was ultimately derived\nfrom Kant and naturalized by Helmholtz. Soon, Schlick was\npresented with an opportunity to display his scientific acumen, by\nexplaining the philosophical import of Special Relativity.\n",
