    "main_text": "Conceptions of language in Indian philosophy || Identifying Linguistic Capacities\n1.1 Identifying Linguistic Capacities\nWhether in the form of words or sentences, language has capacities\u2014it can refer to things, cause mental cognitions, impel action, prompt emotional states, and so on. That such an ability exists is accepted by everyone, although thinkers enumerate the linguistic capacities differently, and also identify different results for them. In terms of outcomes, the meaning which results from the most fundamental linguistic capacity of the word is said to be \u201cprincipal\u201d (mukhya) or \u201cdenoted\u201d (abhidh\u0101). This meaning is sometimes defined in terms of its being understood immediately after speech, by hearers. (The extent to which the phenomenology of language comprehension guides distinctions about meaning is addressed further below.) For some philosophers, from the cognition that this meaning causes, another linguistic capacity can subsequently operate, given certain conditions, to generate a new, \u201csecondary\u201d meaning. This further meaning is sometimes carved into two varieties: indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) and qualitative expression (gau\u1e47av\u1e5btti), something like metonymy and metaphor respectively, although this is to generalize over distinctions important especially in Aesthetics. Two other capacities are sometimes adduced: purport (t\u0101tparya) and suggestion (dhvani), which we will examine more closely below. Initially, let us characterize the first as something like speaker\u2019s intention and the second as encompassing phenomena such as connotations and implicatures which the other capacities putatively cannot explain. In English scholarship, the first two of these four capacities are referred to as \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary,\u201d and this article will follow this convention.\nWhatever the number of capacities, they can be characterized functionally; in fact, the term function (vy\u0101p\u0101ra) or operation (v\u1e5btti) is often used in place of the word for capacity more generally. In attempts to enumerate the capacities, philosophers consider questions such as what the basis of a linguistic function might be, and whether they are one-to-one or one-to-many functions (Ganeri 2006). Discussion of linguistic functions is important for understanding epistemology, a topic of interest primarily to Philosophy in contrast to Grammar and Aesthetics (see the entry on epistemology in classical Indian philosophy). These thinkers focus on how testimonial uses of language are authoritative ways of knowing (pram\u0101\u1e47a), whether in ordinary discourse or religious discourse such as the Vedas or the Buddha\u2019s speech. For one example, consider Ny\u0101ya (\u201cReasoning\u201d). In the Ny\u0101ya root text, Ny\u0101yas\u016btra (NS), attributed to Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da Gautama (ca 200 CE), speech is defined as the assertion of an authoritative person (NS 1.1.7). Since the cognitions resulting from testimony are an important basis for acting, Ny\u0101ya philosophers are concerned with what hearers understand from speech, in particular, from nouns (NS 2.2.56). It is in this context that they take up the relationship between primary and secondary meaning, and the basis for figurative language use. Specifically, they are concerned with whether the principal referent of a noun is\u2014a generic property, a particular thing, or some combination (their preferred view).\nAesthetic thinkers, especially beginning with \u0100nandavardhana (ca 9th century CE), focus on distinctions between the capacities of language. \u0100nandavardhana himself is primarily concerned to defend the existence of a new linguistic capacity, suggestion (on which see section 3 below). With illustrations drawn from poetry, drama, and the epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, he argues that phonemes, words, sentences, and entire discourse units can suggest subtle meanings, associated with an aestheticized emotion or \u201cflavor\u201d (rasa). It is up to later philosophers of aesthetics to explain the status of suggestion with regard to the ordinary categories of linguistic capacities. Some, like Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (ca 9th to 10th century CE) give a reductionist account on which it is equivalent to indication, whereas others, like Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka (ca 900 CE) deny that it is a linguistic capacity at all, but argue, rather, that it is psychological. Aesthetic arguments for and against the various linguistic capacities draw on Ny\u0101ya as well as M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophical texts.\n",
