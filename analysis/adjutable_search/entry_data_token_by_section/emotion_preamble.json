    "main_text": "\n\nNo aspect of our mental life is more important to the quality and\nmeaning of our existence than the emotions. They are what make life\nworth living and sometimes worth ending. So it is not surprising that\nmost of the great classical philosophers had recognizable theories of\nemotions.  These theories typically conceived of emotions as a\nsubject\u2019s phenomenologically salient responses to significant\nevents and as capable of triggering distinctive bodily changes and\nbehaviors. But it is surprising that throughout much of the\ntwentieth-century, scientists and philosophers of mind tended to\nneglect the emotions\u2014in part because of behaviorism\u2019s\nallergy to inner mental states and in part because the variety of\nphenomena covered by the word \u201cemotion\u201d discourages tidy\ntheorizing. In recent decades, however, emotions have once again\nbecome the focus of vigorous interest in philosophy and affective\nscience. Our objective in this entry is to account for these\ndevelopments, focusing primarily on the descriptive question of what\nthe emotions are, but tackling also the normative question of whether\nemotions are rational. In view of the proliferation of exchanges\nbetween researchers of different stripes, it is no longer useful to\nspeak of the philosophy of emotion in isolation from the approaches of\nother disciplines, particularly psychology, neuroscience, and\nevolutionary biology. This is why we have made an effort to pay\nsignificant attention to scientific developments, as we are convinced\nthat cross-disciplinary fertilization is our best chance for making\nprogress in emotion theory.\n\nAfter some brief methodological remarks intended to clarify what\ndifferentiates a philosophical approach from a more general cognitive\nscience perspective on the emotions, we begin by outlining some of the\nways researchers have conceived of the place of emotions in the\ntopography of the mind. We will note that emotions have historically\nbeen conceptualized in one of three main ways: as experiences, as\nevaluations, and as motivations. Each of these research traditions\ncaptures something true and significant about the emotions, but no\ntheory within any tradition appears immune from counterexamples and\nproblem cases. Concerning the rationality of emotions, we will\ndistinguish two main varieties of it\u2014cognitive rationality and\nstrategic rationality\u2014and explore a number of ways in which the\nemotions can succeed or fail with respect to different standards of\nrationality.\n",
