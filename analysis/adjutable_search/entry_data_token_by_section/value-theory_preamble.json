    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cvalue theory\u201d is used in at least three\ndifferent ways in philosophy. In its broadest sense, \u201cvalue\ntheory\u201d is a catch-all label used to encompass all branches of\nmoral philosophy, social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and\nsometimes feminist philosophy and the philosophy of religion \u2014\nwhatever areas of philosophy are deemed to encompass some\n\u201cevaluative\u201d aspect. In its narrowest sense, \u201cvalue\ntheory\u201d is used for a relatively narrow area of normative\nethical theory particularly, but not exclusively, of concern to\nconsequentialists. In this narrow sense, \u201cvalue theory\u201d is\nroughly synonymous with \u201caxiology\u201d. Axiology can be\nthought of as primarily concerned with classifying what things are\ngood, and how good they are. For instance, a traditional question of\naxiology concerns whether the objects of value are subjective\npsychological states, or objective states of the world.\n\nBut in a more useful sense, \u201cvalue theory\u201d designates the\narea of moral philosophy that is concerned with theoretical questions\nabout value and goodness of all varieties \u2014 the theory of value.\nThe theory of value, so construed, encompasses axiology, but also\nincludes many other questions about the nature of value and its\nrelation to other moral categories. The division of moral theory into\nthe theory of value, as contrasting with other areas of investigation,\ncross-cuts the traditional classification of moral theory into\nnormative and metaethical inquiry, but is a worthy distinction in its\nown right; theoretical questions about value constitute a core domain\nof interest in moral theory, often cross the boundaries between the\nnormative and the metaethical, and have a distinguished history of\ninvestigation. This article surveys a range of the questions which\ncome up in the theory of value, and attempts to impose some structure\non the terrain by including some observations about how they are\nrelated to one another.\n",
