    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || Material Constitution\n2.3 Material Constitution\n\nOrdinary objects are constituted by, or made up out of, aggregates of\nmatter. A gold ring is constituted by a certain piece of gold. Clay\nstatues are constituted by pieces of clay. We are naturally inclined\nto regard the statue and the piece of clay as being one and the same\nobject, an object that simply belongs to multiple kinds\n(statue and piece of clay).\n\nThe puzzles of material constitution put pressure on this natural\ninclination. Here is one such puzzle. Let \u2018Athena\u2019 name a\ncertain clay statue and let \u2018Piece\u2019 name the piece of clay\nthat constitutes it. What is puzzling is that all of the following\nseem true:\n\n(MC1)\nAthena exists and Piece exists.\n(MC2)\nIf Athena exists and Piece exists, then Athena = Piece.\n(MC3)\nAthena has different properties from Piece.\n(MC4)\nIf Athena has different properties from Piece, then Athena \u2260\nPiece.\n\n\nThe motivation behind MC2 is that Athena seemingly has exactly the\nsame location and exactly the same parts as Piece. So\n\u2018Athena\u2019 and \u2018Piece\u2019 are plausibly just\ndifferent names for the same thing. The motivation behind MC3 is that\nPiece and Athena seem to have different modal properties: Piece is\nable to survive being flattened and Athena isn\u2019t. MC4 follows\nfrom the Principle of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (a.k.a.\nLeibniz\u2019s Law): \u2200x\u2200y(x=y \u2192 \u2200P(Px iff\nPy)). In other words, if x and y are identical, then they had better\nhave all the same properties. After all, if they are identical, then\nthere is only one thing there to have or lack any given\n property.[21]\n\n\nThe puzzles are sometimes taken to motivate eliminativism, since\neliminativists can simply deny MC1: there are no statues (and perhaps\nno pieces of clay\n either).[22]\n\n\nMore often, however, the puzzles are taken to motivate constitutional\npluralism, the thesis that ordinary objects are typically, if not\nalways, distinct from the aggregates of matter that constitute them.\n(\u2018Typically\u2019 because, in rare cases in which the ordinary\nobject and the aggregate come into existence at the same time and\ncease to exist at the same time, some pluralists will take the\nordinary object to be identical to the aggregate.) Pluralists reject\nMC2: clay statues are not identical to the pieces of clay that\nconstitute them. Pluralists may deny that having the same parts at a\ngiven time suffices for identity, or they may instead deny that the\nstatue and the piece of clay have all of the same\n parts.[23]\n\n\nOne of the main problems facing the pluralist solution is the\ngrounding problem: the modal differences between Athena and Piece\n(e.g., that the one but not the other can survive being flattened)\nseem to stand in need of explanation and yet there seems to be no\nfurther difference between them that is poised to explain, or ground,\nthese\n differences.[24]\n\nDefenders of the pluralist response to these puzzles may, by similar\nreasoning, be led to accept that, in special cases, two objects of the\nsame kind can coincide. Suppose, for instance, that we have a\nfantastically big net (Thin) with very thin netting. We then roll it\nup into a long rope, and we weave that rope into a smaller net (Thick)\nwith a thicker weave. Since the nets intuitively have different modal\nproperties\u2014Thin, but not Thick, can survive the unraveling of\nthe thicker net\u2014the same sort of reasoning that leads one to\nreject MC2 underwrites an argument that the nets are not identical. In\nother words, there are two exactly colocated objects, both of which\nare\n nets.[25]\n\nConstitutional monists, according to whom Athena is identical to\nPiece, will deny MC3. There are various ways of developing the monist\nresponse. First, one might insist that both Athena and Piece (which,\non this view, are identical) can survive flattening: upon flattening,\nAthena ceases to be a statue, but does not cease to exist. We can call\nthose who opt for this approach \u2018phasalists\u2019, since they\ntake being a statue to be a temporary phase that Piece (i.e.,\nAthena) is passing\n through.[26]\n\nAlternatively, monists might deny that Piece (i.e., Athena) can\nsurvive being flattened. When Piece is flattened, Piece ceases to\nexist, at which point an entirely new piece of clay (composed of the\nsame atoms) comes into existence. This strategy is sometimes called\n\u201cthe doctrine of dominant kinds\u201d, since the idea is that\nwhen an object belongs to multiple kinds, the object has the\npersistence conditions associated with whichever of the kinds\n\u201cdominates\u201d the others. Because statue dominates\npiece, Piece is a statue essentially, and therefore cannot\nsurvive ceasing to be\n statue-shaped.[27]\n\nFinally, monists might agree that Piece is able to survive being\nflattened and that Athena is not able to survive being flattened, and\nyet deny that Athena and Piece have different properties. How can that\nbe? On one version of this approach (often associated with counterpart\ntheory), the idea is that \u2018is able to survive being\nflattened\u2019 is context-sensitive, expressing one property when\naffixed to \u2018Athena\u2019 and another when affixed to\n\u2018Piece\u2019. On another, the idea is that \u2018is able to\nsurvive being flattened\u2019 does not express a property at all.\nEither way, we do not end up with any one property that Piece has but\nAthena\n lacks.[28]\n\n",
