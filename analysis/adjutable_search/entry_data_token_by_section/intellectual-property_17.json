    "main_text": "General Critiques of Intellectual Property || Information Wants to be Free\n4.3 Information Wants to be Free\n\nBarlow (1997) argues that information is entitled to moral\nconsideration in virtue of being alive. On his view, information is a\nform of life with a claim to be free that is grounded in interests and\n\u201cwants\u201d of its own. As he puts the point, information\nobjects \u201care life forms in every respect but a basis in the\ncarbon atom. They self-reproduce, they interact with their\nsurroundings and adapt to them, they mutate, they persist.\u201d\nFurther, these living information objects have some sort of interest\nin being made available to everyone free of charge.\n\nBarlow\u2019s argument can be challenged on a couple of grounds.\nFirst, Himma (2005b) argues that it is simply implausible to think of\nabstract objects as having wants \u2014 or even interests. The\nconcept of desire is such that only conscious beings are capable of\nhaving desires; although a conscious being can have subconscious\ndesires, non-sentient entitles are no more accurately characterized as\nhaving desires than as having hopes. Second, even if information\nobjects had wants or interests, Barlow gives no reason for thinking\nthat they have a desire to, or interest in being made freely available\nto all. Certainly, the claim that being made freely available to all\nsomehow benefits information objects needs an argument if for no other\nreason than that it is counterintuitive.\n",
