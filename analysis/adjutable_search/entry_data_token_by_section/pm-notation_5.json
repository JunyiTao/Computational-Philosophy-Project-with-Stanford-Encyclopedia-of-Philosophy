    "main_text": "The Missing Notation for Types and Orders\n5. The Missing Notation for Types and Orders\n\nThis section explains notation that is not in Principia\nMathematica. Except for some notation for \u201crelative\u201d\ntypes in \\(\\ast 63\\), and again in early parts of Volume II, there are\nfamously no symbols for types in Principia Mathematica!\nSentences are generally to be taken as \u201ctypically\nambiguous\u201d and so standing for expressions of a whole range of\ntypes and so just as there are no individual or predicate constants,\nthere are no particular functions of any specific type. So not only\ndoes one not see how to symbolize the argument:\n\nAll men are mortal\n\nSocrates is a man\n\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal \n\nbut also there is no indication of the logical type of the function\n\u201c\\(\\hat{x}\\) is mortal\u201d. The project of PM is to reduce\nmathematics to logic, and part of the view of logic behind this\nproject is that logical truths are all completely general. The\nderivation of truths of mathematics from definitions and truths of\nlogic will thus not involve any particular constants other than those\nintroduced by definition from purely logical notion. As a result no\nnotation is included in PM for describing those types. Those of us who\nwish to consider PM as a logic which can be applied, must supplement\nit with some indication of types.\n\nReaders should note that the explanation of types outlined below is\nnot going to correspond with the statements about types in the text of\nPM. Alonzo Church [1976] developed a simple, rational reconstruction\nof the notation for both the simple and ramified theory of types as\nimplied by the text of PM. (There are alternative, equivalent\nnotations for the theory of types.) The full theory can be seen as a\ndevelopment of the simple theory of types. \n",
