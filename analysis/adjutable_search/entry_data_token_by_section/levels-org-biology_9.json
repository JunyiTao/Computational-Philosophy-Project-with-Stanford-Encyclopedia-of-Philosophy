    "main_text": "Levels in biological theory and usage || Levels and units of selection\n6.1 Levels and units of selection\n\nIn the debate on levels of selection (Lewontin 1970; Brandon 1982),\nthe hierarchical organization of nature into levels is an important\nbackground assumption, as the aim is to find out at which level(s) of\nthe biological hierarchy natural selection is taking place (Griesemer\n2001; Okasha 2006). Although Darwin\u2019s original account was\nfocused on evolution at the level of organisms, the conditions for\nnatural selection can be formulated abstractly without referring to\nany specific kinds of entities, which allows for natural selection to\noperate at any level where the conditions are satisfied (Griesemer\n2001; Lewontin 1970). Since the 1970s, the debate on levels of\nselection has kept on growing and extending to different areas, though\nno precise consensus has been reached. Positions range from the\ngene-centered view, where natural selection is taken to operate almost\nexclusively at the level of genes (e.g., Dawkins 1976; Williams 1966),\nto the pluralistic multilevel selection theory, which allows for\nnatural selection to operate on any level of the biological hierarchy\nwhere we find the right kind of units (e.g., Sober & Wilson 1998;\nWilson & Wilson 2008). For more on the levels of selection debate,\nsee Okasha (2006) and the entry\n Units and Levels of Selection.\n\nIn this debate, the notion of levels of organization is typically used\nas a background notion, the exact meaning of which is left implicit,\nor illustrated with just a list of standard levels (Eronen &\nRamsey forthcoming; Griesemer 2005). A notable exception is Okasha\n(2006), who puts forward a proposal for understanding levels of\norganization in natural selection. Okasha considers the hierarchical\norganization of nature to be one of the key factors that give rise to\nthe levels-of-selection problem, and takes as a starting point the\ntraditional picture where cells are nested within organs and tissues,\nwhich in turn are nested within organisms, and at yet higher levels we\nfind groups, colonies, and so on (Okasha 2006: 10). However, Okasha\nobserves that this standard picture is inadequate, as it is not clear\nwhich levels should be included in the context of levels of selection.\nTherefore, following McShea (2001) and Sober and Wilson (1998), Okasha\nargues that the entities at a level should interact in a way that\naffects their individual fitness (usually defined in terms of the\nnumber of offspring an individual produces). In other words,\nfitness-affecting interactions among parts is taken as a\ndefining feature that distinguishes genuine levels from arbitrary or\nnonrelevant sets of parts. In addition, according to Okasha we need to\nrule out entities such as tissues and organs from genuine levels (of\nselection). To this end, he proposes (referring to McShea 2001) that\nentities at a level should be homologous with organisms in a\nfree-living state, either extant or extinct. For example, the cells\nthat compose organisms interact with each other and are homologous to\nfree-living unicellular organisms, and therefore constitute a level in\nthis account.\n\nThis proposal has been criticized for being too restrictive: (Eronen\n& Ramsey forthcoming): Most importantly, if we include the\nhomology requirement, it is not clear how things like genes or groups\nof organisms could be seen as levels of selection, as they do not seem\nto be homologous with extant or extinct organisms. As an alternative,\nEronen and Ramsey propose to characterize levels of selection directly\nin terms of fitness-affecting interactions (or some notion that plays\na similar role, such as evolutionary individuality): A level is formed\nby any entities that are sufficiently similar and engage in\nfitness-affecting interactions. This results in a very deflationary,\ncase-specific and localized conception of levels of selection, and\nconceptually detaches levels of selection from the broader idea of\nlevels of organization. In general, the relationship between levels of\nselection and levels of organization remains a topic that requires\nfurther philosophical attention (see also\n section 6.5).\n",
