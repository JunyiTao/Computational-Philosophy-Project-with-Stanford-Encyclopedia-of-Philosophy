Epistemic Values, Ethics, and Democracy\n\n\nWith its turn to situated knowing, feminist epistemology can be\ndescribed as having a pragmatic orientation, with a focus on how\nsituated knowers can know well and inquire well in their particular\nsocial worlds. By prioritizing questions concerning good inquiry and\nknowing activities, and arguing that such activities involve\ndependencies on others and social interactions, many feminist\nepistemologists emphasize the ethical dimensions of epistemic pursuits,\nsuggesting that the epistemic cannot be adequately understood if\nseparated out from ethical analysis (Code 1991, 2006). Once feminists\ndraw attention to the fact that knowing is something that we\ndo and do through engagement with others, the ethical\ndimension of knowing becomes apparent. With their interest in how\nagents actively engage in practices of knowing, many feminists have\ndeveloped versions of virtue epistemology that are agent-centered,\narticulating our epistemic responsibilities that often include an\nethical dimension as we interact with and depend on each other in\ninquiry (Code 1991, 2006; Daukas 2006, 2011; Fricker 2007).\nAdditionally, their focus on situated knowing directs feminist\nepistemologists to examine our knowing practices within particular\ncontexts rather than providing abstract analyses of generalizable\nconditions of knowledge acquisition. Such requirements of pragmatic\ncontextualization tend to result in integrative analyses that consider\nthe intersection of traditional epistemic goals with other social\nvalues and goals, including those with an ethical dimension. For\nexample, standards of evidence might rightly differ in various areas\nof knowledge production due to the differing risks of social harm that\ncan come from the generation of certain forms of knowledge. Feminist\nanalyses also draw attention to the different epistemic strategies\nrequired to address challenges that arise for situated knowers in\nspecific social contexts. For example, many feminist analyses focus on\nthe specific challenges that face the socially privileged and\nunderprivileged when they try to know within contexts of\noppression.\n\n\nFeminists\u2019 pragmatic orientation and interest in epistemic\ninquiry within social contexts has led to the development of several\ndifferent paths of investigation that explicitly draw connections\nbetween traditional epistemic values and social and ethical values in\nour epistemic practices, and expand the range of epistemic values under\nconsideration. Prominent topics of investigation include epistemic\ninjustice, epistemologies of ignorance, and the role of democratic\nstructures in knowledge production.\n",
