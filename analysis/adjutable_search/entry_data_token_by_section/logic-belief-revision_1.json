    "main_text": "Introduction || The representation of beliefs and changes\n1.2 The representation of beliefs and changes\n\nIn the AGM model and most other models of belief change, beliefs are\nrepresented by sentences in some formal language. Sentences do not\ncapture all aspects of belief, but they are the best general-purpose\nrepresentation that is presently available.\n\nThe beliefs held by an agent are represented by a set of such\nbelief-representing sentences. It is usually assumed that this set is\nclosed under logical consequence, i.e., every sentence that follows\nlogically from this set is already in the set. This is clearly an\nunrealistic idealization, since it means that the agent is taken to be\n\u201clogically omniscient\u201d, i.e. a perfect logical reasoner.\nHowever, it is a useful idealization since it simplifies the logical\ntreatment; indeed, it seems difficult to obtain an interesting formal\ntreatment without it. In logic, logically closed sets are called\n\u201ctheories\u201d. In formal epistemology they are also called\n\u201ccorpora\u201d, \u201cknowledge sets\u201d, or (more\ncommonly) \u201cbelief sets\u201d.\n\nIsaac Levi (1991) has clarified the nature of this idealization by\npointing out that a belief set consists of the sentences that someone\nis committed to believe, not those that she actually\nbelieves in. According to Levi, we are doxastically committed to\nbelieve in all the logical consequences of our beliefs, but typically\nour performance does not live up to this commitment. The belief set is\nthe set of the agent\u2019s epistemic commitments, and therefore\nlarger than the set of her actually held beliefs.\n\nIn the AGM framework, there are three types of belief change. In\ncontraction, a specified sentence \\(p\\) is removed, i.e., a\nbelief set \\(K\\) is superseded by another belief set \\(K\\div p\\) that\nis a subset of \\(K\\) not containing \\(p\\). In expansion a\nsentence \\(p\\) is added to \\(K\\), and nothing is removed, i.e. \\(K\\)\nis replaced by a set \\(K+p\\) that is the smallest logically closed set\nthat contains both \\(K\\) and \\(p\\). In revision a sentence\n\\(p\\) is added to \\(K\\), and at the same time other sentences are\nremoved if this is needed to ensure that the resulting belief set \\(K*\np\\) is consistent.\n\nIt is important to note the specific character of these models. They\nare input-assimilating. This means that the object of change,\nthe belief set, is exposed to an input, and is changed as a result of\nthis. No explicit representation of time is included. Instead, the\ncharacteristic mathematical constituent is a function that, to each\npair of a belief set and an input, assigns a new belief set.\n",
