Virtue and its Ontology\n\n\u201cVirtue\u201d translates arete, which Socrates\u2019\ncontemporaries used of any sort of excellence that leads to success. A\nnumber of writers before Socrates had used the word and its associated\nvocabulary primarily in ethical contexts. But Socrates was probably\nthe first to identify ethical virtue with what is analogous in the\nsoul to health in the body.\n\nIn Socrates\u2019 usage, virtue is the ability to do what is right\nand resist doing what is wrong. As we learn especially from the\nCrito, Socrates holds that wrong actions harm a part of\none\u2019s self, which he identifies in other dialogues as the soul.\nBecause the soul is more important to us than the body, we should care\nabout nothing so much as virtue, and Socrates understands his role in\nAthens as that of shaming Athenians into taking this most important\nconcern seriously through the care of the soul (29e\u201330a).\n\nIn inquiring after the virtues, Socrates assumes that they have some\nstatus as entities, especially in Euthyphro and Hippies\nMajor. Some scholars have thought this assumption represented an\nearly theory of Platonic forms (Allen 1970; see also Prior 2013 and\nWoodruff 2019.\n\nThe principal virtues of interest to Socrates in this group of\ndialogues are courage (andreia), reverence or piety\n(eusebeia, to hosion), wisdom (sophia),\ntemperance or integrity (sophrosune), and justice\n(dikaiosune), all of which seem to be dependent on, and\nperhaps identical to, wisdom (sophia).\n\nThese dialogues raise two general questions about virtues that are\nimportant to ethical theory, one concerning instrumentality and\nanother concerning unity. They also raise a question about the analogy\nbetween virtue and expert knowledge (techne).\n6. The Instrumentality of Virtue\n\nAre virtues instrumental for other goods, or are they good in\nthemselves? Are they good in themselves or because they promote our\nhappiness? If they are instrumental, are they instrumental in respect\nof themselves, by causing virtue to grow in the holders of virtue and\nin those on whom they have influence? Or are they instrumental in\nhelping us procure external goods for ourselves such as power or\nhappiness? On the instrumentality of virtue there was an important\ndispute between Vlastos and Irwin.\n\nIn a famous passage in Republic 1, which has many affinities\nwith dialogues of our group, a sophist named Thrasymachus challenges\nSocrates to define justice without saying (as he was apparently known\nfor doing) that justice is the beneficial or the advantageous (336d).\nInstead, Thrasymachus insists on the precision that specifies who\nreceives the benefit or advantage of justice; in Thrasymachus\u2019\nview it is the rulers who reap the benefits, while those who are ruled\npay a heavy price. Socrates defends the use of terms such as\n\u201cbeneficial\u201d in defining justice, implying that he would\naccept some sort of instrumental view, but he plainly holds that\njustice is beneficial to everyone who is touched by it. This is the\nmain theme of the Republic, but it also resonates with the\nshorter ethical dialogues, as we shall see. The ending of the\n Hippias Major\n bears on the problem of instrumentality through a discussion of the\nbeneficial as replicating its own goodness (as virtue engenders\nvirtue). Socrates appears to be the first to make eudaimonia\n(happiness, the good life) a goal in ethics. On the relation between\nvirtue and happiness in Socrates\u2019 thought, see Reshotko 2013 and\nWoodruff 2023.\n7. The Unity of Virtue\n\nSocrates argues in the Protagoras for the unity of virtues, a\nthesis that has been variously interpreted and may be supported by\nother dialogues in this group. Vlastos famously explained the thesis\nas bi-conditional: that whoever has one virtue has them all. Others\n(Penner, Woodruff) have argued for a stronger thesis, such that the\ndefinitions of all the virtues would have a common essence. Dialogues\nof definition, such as the Laches, seem to presuppose that\neach virtue has its own definition, but, at the same time, such\ndialogues seem to be moving towards the view that the essence of each\nvirtue is wisdom or knowledge. The Protagoras defines courage\nas the knowledge of what is and is not to be feared (360d), but the\nLaches rejects a similar definition on the grounds that it\ndoes not differentiate courage adequately from other virtues (199e).\nAnd the Euthyphro ends in aporia (at an impasse)\nbecause Socrates is unable to differentiate reverence adequately from\njustice. Efforts to define sophrosune (integrity or\ntemperance) in the Charmides end in an impasse partly owing\nto the difficulty of specifying the subject of the knowledge that is\nthe essence of this virtue. If (as seems the case) Socrates is never\nsatisfied with a definition of a virtue, this may be because the\nvirtues cannot be differentiated.\n\nOn the unity of virtue, see especially Vlastos 1972 and 1994, Penner\n1973, Woodruff 1977, and Rudebusch 2017.\n8. Techne Analogy, Intellectualism, and Moral Injury\n\nTechne is, at the most basic level, what can be learned and\ntaught. The word is usually used for a body of professional knowledge,\nmastered by experts on whom laypeople may safely rely. It is often\ntranslated \u201cart\u201d or \u201ccraft\u201d or\n\u201cskill,\u201d but in these pages it will be rendered\n\u201cexpert knowledge.\u201d Navigation and medicine are frequent\nexamples of expert knowledge. To establish your credentials in expert\nknowledge, you should be able to identify your teachers and students\n(Laches 185b), as well as the specific field of your\nexpertise, which you must have mastered as a whole (e.g., Ion\n532b, ff.). You should also, ideally, be able to give an account of\nthe aim of your profession (e.g. physical health for medicine,\nLaches 190a, moral health for legislation, Gorgias\n465a). Expert knowledge must be rational in its ability to account for\nwhat it does, and rationality in this context seems to consist in\nbasing your decisions on definitions (logoi) that can\nwithstand Socratic questioning. .\n\nSocrates seems to inquire after virtue as if it were, or at least\nresembled, techne, the expert knowledge of living well, or\nthe expert knowledge of care for the soul. If so, this knowledge could\nbe taught and learned. Yet Socrates has grave doubts as to whether\nvirtue can be taught (Protagoras 319a, ff.), and he may be\nusing this analogy of virtue to techne strategically in\nrefuting those who claim to teach virtue.\n\nIf Socrates takes virtue to be a kind of knowledge, then he holds a\nview known as intellectualism. Does Socrates, or does he not, believe\nthat virtue is to be understood on the analogy with expert knowledge?\nIf he believes that virtue is instrumental to happiness (as some\nscholars hold), then he might well believe that virtue is a kind of\npractical knowledge, and the analogy would be helpful. If he believes\n(as other scholars hold) that virtue is at least partly constitutive\nof happiness, and therefore good in itself, then the analogy seems\nmisleading, since bodies of expert knowledge are generally valued as\nmerely instrumental for their goals. If Socrates does not subscribe to\nthe analogy, however, why does he use it in argument? He mostly uses\nit in argument in the context of the larger question whether virtue\ncan be taught, probably on the assumption that, if it can be taught,\nit can be taught as expert knowledge is taught. But Socrates questions\nwhether it can be taught at all. The\n Meno\n will explore a process of learning without teaching; this process is\nknown as recollection. Many scholars are moving to the view that\nSocrates uses the techne analogy dialectically to refute those who\nclaim to teach virtue.\n\nThe word sophia bridges a gap; usually translated\n\u201cwisdom,\u201d it may be used as a rough synonym for\ntechne, but it may also be used for less specific forms of\nwisdom that are not obviously taught or learned and may lack the\nrational features of expert knowledge. When supposed experts fail at\ntasks related to their expertise, Socrates naturally attributes the\nfailure to a lack of expert knowledge; if he does so in the case of\nvirtue, he commits himself to the view that no one can do wrong in\nfull knowledge; on this see the next section.\n\nThere are at least three different positions scholars have taken on\nSocratic intellectualism, best illustrated by their explanations of\ninjury to the soul. For full-scale intellectualists, the only possible\ninjuries to the soul are ignorance and false judgment. For those who\ndeny that Socrates was an intellectualist, injury to the soul is a\nrupture in its order or unity. For those in the middle, it is a\nrupture accompanied by ignorance or false belief. Since the Socratic\nsoul is a unity, anything that theatens to divide it is injurious. The\nhealthy soul is sophron, which cannot in this context mean\n\u201cself-controlled,\u201d as that presupposes a division in which\none part controls another. The associated virtue, sophrosune,\nis more like integrity or undividedness. See Gorgias 482b and\n506e-507a, cf. 475e-476a with Republic 1.352a.\n\nOn techne and the techne analogy, see Irwin 1995.\nFor a skeptical view of Socrates\u2019 commitment to the techne\nanalogy, see Roochnik 1996 and 2002 and Weiss 2006. On the issue of\nSocrates\u2019 intellectualism, see Reshotko 2013, Brickhouse and\nSmith 2013, and Smith 2021.\n\nOn moral injury: Penner and Rowe 1994 and Reshotko 2013 take the\nintellectualist position; Brickhouse and Smith 2010 take a moderate\nposition; Gerson 1997 Weiss 2006 and Woodruff 2023 argue for the\nnon-intellectualist interpretation. \n",
