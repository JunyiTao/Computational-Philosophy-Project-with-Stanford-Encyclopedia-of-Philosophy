    "main_text": "Idealist Metaphysics and Epistemology || Empiricism and Skepticism\n2.1 Empiricism and Skepticism\n\nGreen is concerned with a form of empiricism that he finds in\ncommonsense, as well as philosophical, thought (PE \u00a720).\nThough Green believes that Locke\u2019s Essay was largely\nresponsible for making empiricism philosophically influential, he\nthinks that only Hume adheres to empiricist principles consistently\n(Works I 1\u20135, 132) and that, as a result, the full\nmetaphysical and epistemological difficulties with empiricism become\nclear only in Hume\u2019s work, especially the Treatise. The\nempiricist program on which Green focuses sees all knowledge as\nresting on the deliverances of the senses. On this view, knowledge is\nbuilt up from a foundation of simple discrete sensory experiences. In\nthis sort of experience, the mind is supposed to play a purely passive\nrole. The mind can then play an active role by performing various\noperations on these simple experiences, such as combining simple\nexperiences to form complex ideas, comparing simple experiences for\nsimilarity and dissimilarity, and abstracting the common elements out\nof distinct ideas. In this tradition, reality is associated with\nsimple ideas delivered to the senses and contrasted with the\nworkmanship of the understanding and relations, which are in some\nsense conventional or mind-dependent.\n\nGreen thinks that this empiricist program suffers rot at the\nfoundations; he thinks that simple sensory experience that is not\nrelational and in which the mind plays a purely passive role is\nimpossible. All experience presupposes certain formal conceptions that\nthe subject of experience employs\u2014those of subject and object,\nsubstance and quality, cause and effect, spatiality, and temporality\n(Works I 12\u201313, 16\u201317, 40\u201341,\n43\u201350).\n\nSome sensory judgments are clearly relational, as when we perceive one\nevent A to be the cause of another B. To say that A is the cause of B\nis clearly to relate one event to another. Similarly, to say that A is\na brittle thing is to say that A does or would stand in relations of a\ncertain sort to other things with which it might come into contact.\nThis shows that such relational judgments are products of the\nunderstanding and not proper sensory judgments. Pure sensory judgments\nwould be simple and would not reflect the operation of the\nunderstanding. Perhaps they include only reports of current\nexperience, such as \u201cThis thing appears red\u201d. But Green\nbelieves that even these judgments are implicitly\nrelational\u2014\u201cimply sequence and degree\u201d\u2014and\nrequire comparison of one element of experience with another\n(PE \u00a746). To judge that something is a thing or\nsubstance in which properties inhere presumably requires assigning it\nsome diachronic stability, however limited, and this requires seeing\nit as persisting through some changes\u2014as a part of some series\nof events and not others. And to judge something red is to predicate a\nproperty of an object, but properties or universals are, for the\nempiricist, ideas formed by abstraction from our ideas of simple\nexperiences.\n\nGreen thinks that this conclusion about the relational character of\nexperience has important implications for skepticism. If the\nempiricists are right that reality is given in experience untainted by\nthe understanding, then recognition of the relational character of\nexperience would imply skepticism (PE \u00a7\u00a720, 25,\n30).\n\nGreen himself accepts the skeptical conclusion insofar as he denies\nthe possibility of empirical knowledge of objects independently of how\nthey appear to us. There can be no knowledge of perceiver-independent\nreality. But there can be knowledge of perceiver-dependent reality.\nGreen\u2019s idealism implies that this is the only defensible\nconception of reality that allows us to avoid the skeptical\nconclusion. He avoids the skeptical conclusion by denying empiricist\nassumptions about what is real.\n\nHowever, we can avoid skepticism without endorsing idealism if we\nabandon the claim that relations are the workmanship of the\nunderstanding, rather than given in experience. In particular,\nGreen\u2019s case for idealism is undermined if, as Moore and Russell\nwill later claim, relations can be given in experience and are not the\nproduct of the understanding (see Hylton 1990: 110\u2013112).\n\nGreen argues that the relational character of experience implies that\nexperience depends upon the activities of a self-consciousness agent\n(PE \u00a770). Rejecting Hume\u2019s conception of the self\nas illusory or no more than a bundle of sensations (Treatise\nI.iv.6), Green argues that cognition requires a self that is\nindependent of and prior to experience (PE \u00a716, 32).\nGreen thinks that experience of the world presupposes the operations\nof a self-conscious agent. Could the world itself be the product of a\nself-conscious mind?\n",
