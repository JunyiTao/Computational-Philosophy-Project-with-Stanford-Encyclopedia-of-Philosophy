    "main_text": "Dynamic Epistemic Paradoxes || Meno\u2019s Paradox of Inquiry: A puzzle about gaining knowledge\n6.1 Meno\u2019s Paradox of Inquiry: A puzzle about gaining knowledge\n\nWhen on trial for impiety, Socrates traced his inquisitiveness to the\nOracle at Delphi (Apology 21d in Cooper 1997). Prior to\nbeginning his mission of inquiry, Chaerephon asked the Oracle:\n\u201cWho is the wisest of men?\u201d The Oracle answered \u201cNo\none is wiser than Socrates.\u201d This astounded Socrates because he\nbelieved he knew nothing. Whereas a less pious philosopher might have\nquestioned the reliability of the Delphic Oracle, Socrates followed\nthe general practice of treating the Oracle as infallible. The only\ncogitation appropriate to an infallible answer is interpretation.\nAccordingly, Socrates resolved his puzzlement by inferring that his\nwisdom lay in recognizing his own ignorance. While others may know\nnothing, Socrates knows that he knows nothing.\n\nSocrates continues to be praised for his insight. But his\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d is a contradiction. If Socrates knows that he\nknows nothing, then he knows something (the proposition that he knows\nnothing) and yet does not know anything (because knowledge implies\ntruth).\n\nSocrates could regain consistency by downgrading his meta-knowledge to\nthe status of a belief. If he believes he knows nothing, then he\nnaturally wishes to remedy his ignorance by asking about everything.\nThis rationale is accepted throughout the early dialogues. But when we\nreach the Meno, one of his interlocutors has an epiphany.\nAfter Meno receives the standard treatment from Socrates about the\nnature of virtue, Meno discerns a conflict between Socratic ignorance\nand Socratic inquiry (Meno 80d, in Cooper 1997). How would\nSocrates recognize the correct answer even if Meno gave it?\n\nThe general structure of Meno\u2019s paradox is a dilemma: If you\nknow the answer to the question you are asking, then nothing can be\nlearned by asking. If you do not know the answer, then you cannot\nrecognize a correct answer even if it is given to you. Therefore, one\ncannot learn anything by asking questions.\n\nThe natural solution to Meno\u2019s paradox is to characterize the\ninquirer as only partially ignorant. He knows enough to recognize a\ncorrect answer but not enough to answer on his own. For instance,\nspelling dictionaries are useless to six year old children because\nthey seldom know more than the first letter of the word in question.\nTen year old children have enough partial knowledge of the\nword\u2019s spelling to narrow the field of candidates. Spelling\ndictionaries are also useless to those with full knowledge of spelling\nand those with total ignorance of spelling. But most of us have an\nintermediate amount of knowledge.\n\nIt is natural to analyze partial knowledge as knowledge of\nconditionals. The ten year old child knows the spoken version of\n\u2018If the spelling dictionary spells the month after January as\nF-e-b-r-u-a-r-y, then that spelling is correct\u2019. Consulting the\nspelling dictionary gives him knowledge of the antecedent of the\nconditional.\n\nMuch of our learning from conditionals runs as smoothly as this\nexample suggests. Since we know the conditional, we are poised learn\nthe consequent merely by learning the antecedent (and by applying the\ninference rule modus ponens: If \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\),\n\\(P\\), therefore \\(Q\\)).\nBut the next section is devoted to some known\nconditionals that are repudiated when we learn their antecedents.\n",
