    "main_text": "Feminist Solidarity After Queer Theory || Gender as Relational\n8.2 Gender as Relational\n\nCressida Heyes continues this non-trans feminist project of finding\ngrounds for solidarity between (non trans) feminists and trans folk.\nFollowing Hale, she argues that woman is a family-resemblance\nconcept, regulated in different ways for different political purposes\n(2000, 84\u20135). And following Scheman, she notes that in some cases\ndifferences between trans and non-trans women (such as being\n\u201cperinatally pinked\u201d) may need to be emphasized for\npolitical purposes (93). She offers a critique of the non-trans\nfeminist positions of Raymond and Hausman, while also critiquing what\nshe sees as troubling tendencies in some transgender politics (such as\nthe work of Leslie Feinberg) to adopt a liberal conception of the self\nas atomistic (2003). In this way, she seeks to find some middle, common\nground.\n\nHeyes argues that both Raymond and Hausman are caught in the grip of a\npicture which precludes any examination of their own gender privilege\nwhile foreclosing the possibility of perceiving trans resistance (2003,\n1095). This foreclosure is accomplished through assimilating all\ntranssexual subjectivity into to a hetero-patriarchal medical discourse\nabout transsexuality (2003, 1095). Using Feinberg's book\nTrans Liberation as an example, Heyes also raises worries\nabout a transgender politics which says that individual gender\nexpression ought not be subject to criticism, restriction, or\noppression. She observes that gender is not merely an aesthetic style\nor expression of an isolated self. It is relational and often embedded\nin problematic systems of oppression. This means that forms of\nmasculinity involve interacting with women, for example, in particular\nways. Certain forms of masculinity involve misogyny. What it means to\nbe a \u201creal man\u201d may involve relating to women in\nhostile, destructive ways. Such gender behavior ought to be\ncritiqued. What is missing from accounts which merely tout gender\nfreedom of expression, Heyes argues, is a rich \u201cethics of\ntransformation\u201d which distinguishes between progressive\ntransformations from those who are oppressed and marginalized and\nhegemonic (i.e., dominant; oppressive) forms of gender that only\nfurther oppression and marginalization (2003, 1111\u20133).\n",
