In some places, he speaks of a\n\u201ctemple\u201d or a \u201clittle castle\u201d\n(b\u00fcrgelin)\u2014a place in which God can\n\u201creside\u201d. In others, it is a \u201csprout\u201d or\n\u201clittle spark\u201d (v\u00fcnkelin)\u2014the\nintellective power or potential to, like God, \u201cwork in\nnonbeing\u201d. As the highest (or \u201crichest\u201d) aspect of\nour humanity, it is sometimes referred to as a \u201cnobleman\u201d.\nYet, as with his account of God\u2019s creation of the universe, the\ndriving metaphor behind much of Eckhart\u2019s language about the\nground of the soul is that of pregnancy and birth.\nAlthough his language is in keeping with a longstanding Christian\ntradition of allegorically representing the human soul as a female\n(the MHG word s\u00eale and the Latin anima are\nboth feminine nouns), and despite taking on familiar tropes from\nRhenish-Flemish bridal mysticism as well as the common scholastic\nunderstanding of women\u2019s bodies as mere \u201cpassive\nreceptacles\u201d\u2014Eckhart is perhaps at his most creative (or\nat least his most emphatic) when discussing what he calls the\n\u201cbirth of the Word\u201d in the human soul. (For an extended\ndiscussion of the ways in which Eckhart\u2019s views both perpetuate\nand subvert medieval gender stereotypes and norms see Hollywood 1995\n[2001], especially Chapters 5 and 6. For Eckhart\u2019s own extended\nreflections on the birth of the Word in the soul, see the famous\n\u201cbirth cycle\u201d\u2014Pr. 101\u2013104\u2014which\nthe Meister likely composed for the Advent/Christmas season; DW\nI/1V:279\u2013610; MW 29\u201361.)\n\nOne of Eckhart\u2019s most interesting allegorical uses of these\nmetaphors involves his innovative reading of Luke 10:38 (which Eckhart\ntranslates as \u201cOur Lord Jesus Christ went up into a citadel and\nwas received by a virgin who was a wife\u201d) and his discussion of\nthe ways in which the soul itself should be like a \u201cvirgin\nwife\u201d. Roughly speaking, Eckhart\u2019s claim is that the soul\nmust be \u201cstripped\u201d of all the external objects of\nconsciousness that serve to distract it and \u201cemptied\u201d of\nall its finite attachments. When it is pure, naked, and unsullied by\nworldly things\u2014\u201cvoid of alien images\u201d (von allen\nvremden bilden ledic) as Eckhart puts it\u2014the soul becomes\ntruly \u201cfree\u201d and unobstructed (\u201coffering no\nhindrance to the highest Truth\u201d), and therefore \u201ca maiden,\na virgin\u201d who can receive the \u201cempty and free and\nvirginal\u201d Jesus, i.e., the Truth that is the Word. When the\nintellect is thusly \u201cfreed\u201d and\n\u201cbare\u201d\u2014when it is turned inward toward itself and\nbrought back down to its objectless grunt (which is also\nunivocally God\u2019s ground)\u2014it is thereby transformed into\nthe passive vehicle of the Eternal Word. In fact, Eckhart goes so far\nas to claim that, once it has become purged of external images and\ncreaturely things, God cannot refrain from thusly\n\u201cimpregnating\u201d the receptive soul:\n\n\nWhen God finds you ready, He has to act, to overflow into you, just as\nwhen the air is clear and pure the sun has to burst forth and cannot\nrefrain, (Pr. 103; DW IV/1:484; MW 58)\n\n\nand elsewhere, \u201che is forced to do it; he must do it of\nnecessity\u201d (Pr. 14; DW I:234; TP 272).\n\nThe claim that God is forced to do anything with respect to the human\nbeing, let alone enter into their soul, may appear quite radical at\nfirst glance, but when we recall that the ground of the soul is the\nunivocal point of connection to the divine, and that this connection\nis, for Eckhart, fundamentally intellectual, we may think of\nthe Meister\u2019s necessity claim less as making a causal assertion\n(e.g., \u201cthe emptied soul causes God to enter the\nsoul\u201d) and more as expressing a fundamental truth to be\ndiscovered by the subject. Indeed, the problem of human beings as\ncreatures occupied with finite things is first and foremost an\nepistemic one: We neither understand what we, at our core,\nreally are\u2014namely, the images and\n\u201coffspring\u201d of God\u2014nor how to \u201cwant\u201d\nproperly (Connolly 2014: 141). We need to be \u201cstill\u201d, to\nempty ourselves of worldly distractions and illusory attachments, to\nbe able to \u201chear\u201d and come to understand the Word that is\neternally communicated by the Father in the ground. In this sense, it\nis not as though God is absent in us and then becomes present due to\nsome action of ours that we undertake of our own initiative. Rather,\nfor Eckhart, our task as human beings is to come to be able to\nlisten to\u2014and thereby apprehend\u2014the Word\nthat is eternally and always poured out into in us. (It is also\nnoteworthy that Eckhart shifts the traditional Christian emphasis on\nthe beatific vision in which one sees God face to face to the\nmodality of spiritually hearing the self-communication of the\ndivine.) Further, just as a pregnant person is, in a very real sense,\none with that which they have conceived, the\n\u201cpregnant\u201d soul and God are united in the\nground\u2014thereby again preserving the identity of the intellect\nand the intelligible.\n\nIn this sense, then, only the soul \u201cstripped bare\u201d of its\nobjects and attachments\u2014a soul that has been wholly\n\u201cde-imaged\u201d (entbildet) can truly\nconceive the divine already within it. However, this\n\u201cbirth\u201d is not, according to Eckhart, something we can\nsimply will to bring about\u2014at least not in the ordinary\nsense of prudential means-ends reasoning. First, Eckhart is emphatic\nthat God should not be sought for the sake of any reward or external\nstate such as heaven, eternal bliss, or even the rapturous experience\nof God itself. In other words, the return of the soul to God is not a\nmere means to some further desirable or pleasurable end. It is\nidentical with our ultimate end, our telos, and should be\nsought for its own sake. Neither is it an end that can be reached by\nadopting particular methods or techniques. According to Eckhart, God\nshould not\u2014indeed, cannot\u2014be sought in such \u201cspecial\nways\u201d as devotion, prayer, meditation, good works, or even\ndivinely inspired religious ecstasy: \u201cWhoever seeks God in a\nspecial way gets the way and misses God, who lies hidden in it\u201d\n(Pr. 5b; DW I:91; MW 110). Rather, Eckhart says, the soul in\nits ground must always act as God acts, i.e., \u201cwithout [a]\nwhy\u201d (\u0203ne warumbe). When we give ourselves wholly\nover to God, and the Word is born in the ground of our souls, God will\nsimply act through us, such that our actions are God\u2019s\nactions and therefore performed simply for their own sake without some\nfurther \u201cwhy\u201d or \u201cwherefore\u201d.\n",
