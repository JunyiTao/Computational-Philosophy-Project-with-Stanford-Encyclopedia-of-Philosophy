    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nThere are several different dates ascribed to \u015aa\u1e45kara.\nEarly scholars placed him from 788\u2013820 CE. Nakamura (1983:\n48\u201388) argues for an earlier date of 700\u2013750 CE, and\ndiscusses the various dating theories at length. Potter (1981:\n14\u201315, 116\u2013119) places him from the late seventh to early\neighth centuries CE due to the dating of a contemporaneous Advaitin\nnamed Ma\u1e47\u1e0danami\u015bra (see Thrasher 1979 on\nMa\u1e47\u1e0danami\u015bra\u2019s dating). There are no dependable\nhistorical records of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s life beyond his\nwritten works which provide few biographical clues. Scholars are also\nnot clear about his religious identity. According to the Advaita\nVed\u0101nta tradition itself, he was \u015aaiva (a devotee of the\ndeity \u015aiva); but several scholars believe he was\nVai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee of the deity Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (see\nClark 2006: 159\u2013170 for an overview of these theories).\nHagiographical accounts of his life, the\n\u015aa\u1e45karavijayas (Conquests of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara), were composed several centuries after his\ndeath. They describe him as being born in Kal\u0101\u1e0di, located\nin modern day Kerala. He became a renouncer at a young age, left his\nfamily to pursue liberation, and spent his life travelling around the\nsub-continent while teaching his pupils, engaging in philosophical\ndebate, and composing his works. He supposedly died at the young age\nof thirty-two. (See Bader 2000 for a discussion of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s life according to his hagiographies).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara was a systematizer of Advaita Ved\u0101nta, not a\nfounder. He viewed himself as part of a long lineage of teachers.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s teacher was named Govinda; and according to\ntradition, Govinda\u2019s teacher was Gau\u1e0dap\u0101da (sixth\ncentury CE), who composed the\nGau\u1e0dap\u0101dak\u0101rik\u0101s (Verses of\nGau\u1e0dap\u0101da) on the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya\nUpani\u1e63ad. The historical record of Advaita Ved\u0101nta is\nobscure prior to Gau\u1e0dap\u0101da (see Nakamura 2004 for his\nextensive work on pre-\u015aa\u1e45kara Ved\u0101ntins). Advaita\nVed\u0101ntins trace their lineage back through\nB\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a (ca. first century BCE), who authored the\nBrahmas\u016btras (The Aphorisms on Brahman), to the\nindividuals in Upani\u1e63adic narratives, and ultimately to\n\u012b\u015bvara (roughly \u201cGod\u201d) as\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u-N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a or the teaching form of\n\u015aiva known as Dak\u1e63in\u0101m\u016brti. By this lineage they\nclaim the authority of Upani\u1e63adic teachers,\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and B\u0101dar\u0101yana as their own. The\ncorresponding texts of the Upani\u1e63ads,\nBhagavadg\u012bt\u0101, and Brahmas\u016btras\nconstitute Advaita Ved\u0101nta\u2019s triple canon\n(prasth\u0101natray\u012b).\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s textual works\ndefine his identity. He composed our earliest complete extant\ncommentaries on the Brahmas\u016btras,\nBhagavadg\u012bt\u0101, and the ten principal Upani\u1e63ads\nconsisting of the \u012a\u1e63\u0101, Kena,\nKa\u1e6dha, Pra\u1e63na,\nMu\u1e47\u1e0daka, M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya,\nAitareya, Taittir\u012bya, Ch\u0101ndogya,\nand B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upanisads.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s commentary on the\nM\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dukya is part of his extensive commentary\non the Gau\u1e0dap\u0101dak\u0101rik\u0101s\u2019\nexplanation of the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara also composed an independent work titled the\nUpade\u015bas\u0101hasr\u012b (A Thousand\nTeachings). There are hundreds of other texts attributed to\n\u015aa\u1e45kara, but their authorship is questionable and most were\nlikely composed in later centuries by monastic heads who held a\n\u201c\u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya\u201d title. (See Potter\n1981: 115\u2013117; Hacker 1995; and Mayeda 1965a, 1965b, and 1967\nfor discussions of \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s likely works, as well as\nHacker\u2019s criteria for determining their authenticity. See\nSundaresan 2002 for some critiques and expansion of Hacker\u2019s\ncriteria).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara was an exegete, philosopher, and teacher. His\nprimary commitment was to establish his philosophy of nondual\nbrahman as the subject matter of the Upani\u1e63ads, and to\nsystematize Advaita exegesis by harmonizing the diverse and\npotentially contradictory passages between Upani\u1e63adic texts. One\nmust note however, that \u015aa\u1e45kara does not attempt to prove\nnonduality solely through independent reasoning. Such an endeavor is\nnot possible in his opinion because nonduality is not subject to\nlogical proofs (see Murty 1959 on the role of reason for\n\u015aa\u1e45kara). He accepts nonduality based on the\nUpani\u1e63ad\u2019s authority alone. Nonetheless, he was an\noriginal philosopher who constructed novel arguments to make sense of\nthe Upani\u1e63ads, defend his positions, and critique his\nphilosophical adversaries. \u015aa\u1e45kara also shaped a\npedagogical method to approach texts as a means of knowledge. At the\nsame time, he left several open questions and ambiguities in his\nwriting, in part due to the different source texts of his commentaries\nand the voluminous amount of his work. This has led to different\ninterpretations and several intra-Advaitin philosophical disputes in\nthe post-\u015aa\u1e45kara tradition (see Potter 2012).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara purportedly established the earliest monastic\nsystem in Brahmanical religion, including the Da\u015ban\u0101m\u012b\n(Ten Names) renouncer orders (see Clark 2006 on these orders) as well\nas four or five principle monasteries (ma\u1e6dhas) across\nthe subcontinent (see Cenkner 1983 on ma\u1e6dhas). Many\n\u015aa\u1e45kara-identifying lineages, along with the principle\nmonasteries, and several smaller monasteries, hermitages, and learning\ninstitutions continue to flourish today in the living Advaita\nVed\u0101nta tradition. An unbroken lineage beginning with\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s direct disciples, such as Padmap\u0101da\nand Sure\u015bvara, continued to develop, defend, and expand upon his\nphilosophy into the modern period. At present,\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s Advaita Ved\u0101nta extends far beyond its\northodox cultural and geographical confines. Its streams of thought\ncontinue to evolve due to the encounter with different philosophical,\ntheological, and socio-political contexts; yet the tradition as a\nwhole demonstrates a significant degree of philosophical continuity\nfrom past to present.\n",
