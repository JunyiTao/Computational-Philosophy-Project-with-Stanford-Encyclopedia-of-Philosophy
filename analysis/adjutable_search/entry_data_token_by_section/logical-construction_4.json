    "main_text": "Classes\n5. Classes\n\nRussell\u2019s \u201cNo-Class\u201d theory of classes from\n\u221720 of Principia Mathematica provides a contextual\ndefinition like that of the theory of definite descriptions. One of\nRussell\u2019s early diagnoses of the paradox of the class of all\nclasses that are not members of themselves was that it showed that\nclasses could not be individuals. Indeed Russell seems to have come\nacross his paradox by applying Cantor\u2019s famous diagonal argument\nto show that there are more classes of individuals than individuals.\nHence, he concluded, classes could not be individuals, and expressions\nfor classes such as \u2018\\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\)\u2019 cannot be the\nsingular terms they appear to be. Inspired by the theory of\ndescriptions, Russell proposed that to say something \\(G\\) of the\nclass of \\(F\\)s, \\(G\\) \\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\), is to say that there is some\n(predicative) property \\(H\\) coextensive with (true of the same things\nas) \\(F\\) such that \\(H\\) is \\(G\\). The restriction to predicative\nproperties, or those which are not defined in terms of quantification\nover other properties, was a consequence of the ramification\nof the theory of types to avoid intensional or \u201cepistemic\u201d\nparadoxes which motivated the theory of types in addition to the set\ntheoretical \u201cRussell\u2019s Paradox\u201d (see Whitehead and\nRussell 1910\u201313, Introduction, Chapter II). These predicative\nproperties are intensional, however, in the sense that two distinct\nproperties might hold of the same objects. (See the entry on the\n notation in Principia Mathematica.)\n That classes so defined have the feature of extensionality is thus\nderivable, rather than postulated. If \\(F\\) and \\(H\\) are coextensive\nthen anything true of \\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\) will be true of \\(\\{x:Hx \\}\\).\nFeatures of classes then follow from the features of the logic of\nproperties.\n\nBecause classes would at first seem to be individuals of some sort,\nbut on analysis are found not to be, Russell speaks of them as\n\u201clogical fictions,\u201d an expression which echoes Jeremy\nBentham\u2019s notion of \u201clegal fictions.\u201d (Hart 1994,\n84) (See entry on\n law and language).\n That a corporation is a \u201cperson\u201d at law was for Bentham\nmerely a fiction that could be cashed out in terms of the notion of\nlegal standing and of limits to the financial liability of real\npersons. Thus any language about such \u201clegal fictions\u201d\ncould be translated in other terms to be about real individuals and\ntheir legal relationships. Because statements attributing a property\nto particular classes are replaced by existential sentences saying\nthat there is some propositional function having that property, this\nconstruction also can be characterized as showing that class\nexpressions, such as \u2018\\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\)\u2019, are incomplete\nsymbols. They are not replaced by some longer formula expressing a\nterm. On the other hand, the definition should not be seen as avoiding\nontological commitment entirely, as showing that something is\nliterally a \u201cfiction\u201d. Rather it shows how to reduce\nclasses to propositional functions. The properties of classes are\nreally properties of propositional functions and for every class said\nto have a property there really is some propositional function having\nthat property.\n",
