    "main_text": "Philosophy of Biology\n4. Philosophy of Biology\n\nOn the Parts of Animals, book I (PA I) begins by\noutlining its purpose, which is to establish a set of standards for\njudging natural investigations (639a15). Its five chapters pursue this\npurpose, discussing the appropriate level of generality for such\nstudies, the modes of causality and of necessity to be used in\nbiological explanations, the relation of form to matter in living\nthings, the proper method of logical division for this subject matter,\nthe means of identifying kinds and their activities at the proper\nlevel of abstraction, and much more. Two sorts of evidence support the\nconclusion that this book is intended to deal with problems and\nquestions that arise in the application of Aristotle\u2019s general\nphilosophy of science, found in the Posterior Analytics, to\nhis theoretical investigation of living nature.\n\nThe first kind of evidence consists of passages introducing his\nbiological investigations that appear to make explicit reference to\nthe account of scientific knowledge in APo. The following\npassage from the History of Animals (a better though less\nfamiliar translation would be Animal Inquiries), for example,\nsuggests that the entire biological project is organized in accordance\nwith the theory of inquiry developed in APo. II. This passage\ncomes near the end of chapter six in the first book of HA.\nAfter five chapters in which Aristotle lays out the kinds of\nsimilarities and differences among animals to be studied and sketches\nthe ways in which they are to be investigated, he makes the following\nprogrammatic statement about the investigation to come, and where it\nfits in the entire scientific study of animals.\n\nThese things, then, have now been said by way of outline to provide a\ntaste of what things need to be studied, and what it is about them\nthat needs to be studied, in order that we may first grasp the\ndifferences and the attributes belonging to all animals. After we do\nthis, we must attempt to discover the causes. For it is natural to\ncarry out the investigation in this way, beginning with the inquiry\ninto each thing; for from these inquiries it becomes clear both about\nwhich things (peri h\u00f4n) the demonstration\n(t\u00ean apodeixin) should be and from which things\n(ex h\u00f4n) it should proceed. (HA I 6,\n491a7\u201314)\n\n\nThe natural way to proceed, then, is to begin with inquiry\n(historia), with the aim of grasping the differences between,\nand attributes of, all the animals; and then to attempt to\ndiscover their causes. This is natural because, given that our goal is\ndemonstrative understanding, we want to end up with a clear\ndistinction between the facts to be explained (the peri\nh\u00f4n) and their explanation (the ex\nh\u00f4n). This statement echoes the summary, in\nAPo. I 10, of the components of demonstrative knowledge:\n\nNevertheless there are by nature these three [components of\ndemonstrative knowledge]: that about which (peri ho) it\nproves, what it proves, and those things from which (ex\nh\u00f4n) it proves. (76b21\u201322)\n\n\nThe History of Animals characterizes itself as establishing\nthe attributes and the differences that belong to all animals, and\nclaims that by carrying out this inquiry we are prepared to go on to\nsearch for the causes. Indeed, he appears to suggest that a successful\nhistoria or factual inquiry will prepare us to grasp the\ndifference between those facts that need to be explained and those\nthat will be invoked in our explanations. In the language of the\nPosterior Analytics: HA establishes the\nfact, e.g. that all animals with lungs have\nwindpipes, or that all cetacea have lungs and are viviparous,\ntypically seeking to identify groups by means of discovering\nco-extensive differentiae with the aid of the method of\n division.[5]\n The proper use of division, moreover, will give clear indications of\nwhich predications are basic and which derivative. Works such as\nParts of Animals or Generation of Animals, on the\nother hand, seek to establish the reason why\u2014the cause\u2014of\nthe fact. If Aristotle is following the method described in the\nAnalytics, these causal explanations should at the same time\npoint us to essential definitions of what it is to be a windpipe or to\nbe viviparous. It is a question currently much debated whether\ndefinition was, in fact, an explicit goal of HA or simply a\nconsequence of the explanatory goal clearly identified in the above\npassage from HA I 6; and if so, whether definitions of animal\nkinds were sought, or only definitions of their attributes.\nAs we will see, there are a number of chapter summaries in the\nexplanatory treatises that make a point of claiming that both\nan explanation of why a part is found in those animals that\nhave it, and an account of what that part is, have\nbeen provided; but one must work very hard to reconstruct any\ndefinitions of animal kinds in those treatises.\n [6]\n\nA number of texts in Aristotle\u2019s causal investigations reinforce\nthe message of HA I 6, stressing that the preliminary work of\ninquiries that establish and organize the facts at various levels of\ngenerality has been accomplished; and they regularly refer to\nsomething like what is reported in our HA as the place to\nlook for the results of this preliminary work. Two explicit statements\nto that effect follow, one from the beginning of his study of the\ncauses of the differences in animal locomotion, one from the beginning\nof his study of the causes of the differences among the parts of\nanimals.\n\nClearly there needs to be a study of all of these questions about\nanimal locomotion and any others of the same kind; for that\n(hoti) these things are thus is clear from our inquiries into\nnature (t\u00eas historias t\u00eas phusik\u00eas);\nthe reason why (dioti) must now be investigated.\n(IA 1, 704b7\u201310)\n\n\nFrom which parts and from how many parts each of the animals is\nconstituted has been exhibited more clearly in the inquiries about\nthem (en tais historiais tais peri aut\u00f4n); it is the\ncauses owing to which each animal has this character that\nmust now be examined, on their own and apart (chorisantas\nkath\u2019hauta) from what was said in the inquiries.\n(PA II 1, 646a8\u201312)\n\n\nEach of these passages explicitly describes the study of animals with\nwhich Aristotle is engaged in the language of Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof research in APo. II 1. Indeed, the passage from\nHA I 6 does so by insisting that the natural\nmethod to use is to first get clear on the differences and\nattributes to be demonstrated (\u2018establish the fact\nthat\u2026\u2019) before going on to find the causes\n(\u2018the reason why, i.e. the cause\u2019) to be appealed to in\nthese demonstrations. Animal inquiries (historiai) are a kind\nof hoti inquiry\u2014that is, the History of\nAnimals presents the facts to be explained, organized so as to be\nprepared for causal\n demonstration.[7]\n\nThe IA and PA, on the other hand, refer to\nthemselves as pursuing a causal inquiry into the reason\nwhy the various kinds of animals are differentiated as they\nare, and they acknowledge that they are able to do this precisely\nbecause the factual investigation into the locomotion and parts of\nanimals has been accomplished. In both cases Aristotle emphasizes the\ndistinction on which we are focused, perhaps in order to remind his\nreaders of his philosophy of scientific research.\n\nThere is a second line of evidence, quite independent of these\nprogrammatic statements, which leads to the same conclusion. The\ntopics covered in PA I take the form of specifications of the\ncentral topics of the Posterior Analytics. These\nspecifications are required because animals are [a] complex unities of\nmatter (body) and form (soul); [b] arise by a complex process of\ndevelopment; [c] the end\u2014that for the sake of which the\ndevelopment occurs\u2014 is both causally and definitionally prior to\nthat process; [d] a distinctive kind of necessity, conditional\nnecessity, is operative; and [e] a special method of\nmulti-differentiae division is required. Such a discussion is required\nby the fact that although the Posterior Analytics intends its\nepistemic standards to be applicable to natural science \u2013 as is\nclear from the many examples drawn from natural science in book II\n\u2013 it provides no details as to how this application is to be\naccomplished.\n\nWhat, then, does PA I tell us about the proper way to\ninvestigate animals? Aristotle begins by posing a problem about how to\nidentify the proper objects of investigation. Should we begin by\nstudying the features of groups close to the level of perception, such\nas human beings, horses, dogs and such, or should we look for\nattributes that \u2018belong in common according to kind, and then\nlater study their distinctive attributes\u2019 (639b4\u20135). He\nnotes that since there are many attributes that are common to many of\nthese more concrete kinds, focusing our study on them will have the\nresult of our repeating ourselves\u2014much as if, to use an example\nfrom APo II discussed in Section 2, we were to remain at the\nlevel of \u2018olive trees lose their leaves\u2019, \u2018grape\nvines lose their leaves\u2019. Among these common attributes,\nAristotle distinguishes those that seem not to differ across the kinds\nthat have them (he cites respiration and death) from those that are\n\u2018 distinctive in form \u2019 such as locomotion. As he puts it:\n\u201cit is apparent that locomotion is not one in form, because\nflying, swimming, walking, and crawling differ\u201d (639b1\u20132).\nAristotle deals with this question, so reminiscent of APo. I\n4\u20135, in PA I 4, but only after he has introduced a new\nway of thinking about differentiae and division appropriate for\ninvestigating animals. After discussing his recommendations regarding\nthe use of logical division in biology, we will return to look at his\nanswer.\n\nAnimals are complex structures organized so as to be able to perform\nan integrated set of functions and activities; yet the Posterior\nAnalytics provides one with very little guidance as to how to\napply its norms to such things. Again PA I, and especially\nchapters 1 and 5, appears designed to provide that guidance. It seeks\nto establish [a] the priority of goal-causation to motive-causation,\n[b] the priority of the study of an animal\u2019s form (which, he\nargues, should be identified with its soul) to the study of its\nmaterial constituents (i.e. its body), and [c] the presence of a\nspecial kind of necessity operative where goals and form take\npriority, namely hypothetical or conditional necessity (cf.\nPA I 1, 640a10\u2013641a32, 642a1\u201331).\n\nThe argument is complicated in virtue of its manner of presentation.\nFirst, it is a narrative in which Aristotle gradually develops his own\nviews by exposing the errors of those who investigated nature before\nhim; it is structured as presenting an alternative to views expressed\nby Empedocles and Democritus, and as in the spirit of Socrates\n(642a24\u201331). Second, as is so typical of him, what initially may\nappear to be three separate narratives turn out to be a single,\ncomplex case for emphasizing the study of form, teleological\nexplanation, and conditional necessity when studying living things.\nForm, in the case of living things, turns out to be the capacity to\nperform living functions such as nutrition, perception, or locomotion,\ni.e. soul; and thus the form of a living thing is causally prior to\nthe matter, because it is the goal for the sake of which the parts of\nthe animal\u2014its matter\u2014come to be and exist. This, in turn,\nprovides us with the appropriate way to understand \u2018conditional\nnecessity\u2019\u2014parts and the processes that produce them do\nnot necessitate the outcome; on the contrary, the outcome necessitates\nthat the developmental processes bring about the parts that are\nnecessary for the organism to live its life, and do so in a temporally\nand spatially coordinated manner (cf. GA II 4,\n740b19\u201334; II 6, 743a16\u201336).\n\nChapters 2 and 3 have a similar narrative structure. Gradually, a\npositive theory of biological division emerges from the ashes of a\ndetailed critical analysis of those (Plato and certain of his\nstudents) who \u201cattempt to grasp the particular by dividing the\nkind into two differences\u201d (642b5), a practice he finds in\n\u201cthe written divisions\u201d (642b11), perhaps a reference to\ndivisions we find in some of Plato\u2019s later dialogues, or perhaps\nto lost works by other members of Plato\u2019s Academy. The method he\nis criticizing combines two basic techniques that lead to things being\ngrouped together that are fundamentally different and things being\ngrouped separately that are fundamentally similar: dichotomy and\ndivision by non-essentials. Dichotomy is the method of dividing the\nmore general differentia into two exhaustive alternatives, which often\nentails that one of the alternatives is simply the privation of the\nother (winged, wingless). Division by non-essentials involves dividing\na prior differentia-class by means of an unrelated difference. For\nexample, you might first divide animals into winged and wingless, and\nthen winged animals into wild and tame.\n\nI mean the sort of thing that results by dividing animals into the\nwingless and the winged, and winged into tame and wild, or pale and\ndark. Neither tame nor pale is a difference of winged; rather each is\nthe origin of another difference, while here it is incidental.\n(643b19\u201322)\n\n\nTo avoid the problems created by this dichotomous and arbitrary\nmethod, Aristotle recommends a method that divides each wider\ndifferentia by more and more determinate forms of that differentia\n(wings into forms of wing, beaks into forms of beak), and does so\nsimultaneously on as many differentiae as are correlated at a given\nlevel of universality.\n\nRather, one should try to take animals by kinds, following the lead of\nthe many in demarcating a bird kind and a fish kind. Each of these has\nbeen defined by many differences, not according to dichotomy.\n(643b9\u201312)\n\n\nThus, if all birds have beaks, feathers, wings of a sort, are bipedal,\netc. , the biologist needs to perform the proper sort of division on\nall of these in order to grasp the various sub-kinds of bird. This\nwill not, of course, give us demonstrative knowledge; but it will help\nus to grasp the co-extensively correlated features, at each level of\nspecificity, that are the proper things about which to seek\ndemonstrative knowledge.\n\nAn interesting feature of this extended criticism of dichotomous,\narbitrary division and the development of a systematic,\nmulti-differentiae alternative is that it takes for granted the\n\u2018naturalness\u2019 of certain kinds that \u2018the many\u2019\nhave identified. As he says above, \u2018these [birds and fish] have\nbeen defined by many differences\u2019; earlier he had said that the\nterms \u2018bird\u2019 and \u2018fish\u2019 name a\n\u2018similarity\u2019, a group of animals that are \u2018alike in\nkind\u2019 that dichotomous division inappropriately tears apart\n(642b13\u201319). During the discussion of division there is very\nlittle clarification of what underlies this notion of similarity or\nlikeness in kind. However, armed with a method of division suited to\nthe study of animals, the discussion quickly turns to the question of\nwhat it is that makes it appropriate to treat all birds or all fish as\na single kind, and to the specification of rules for identifying other\nsuch kinds. What \u2018bird\u2019 and \u2018fish\u2019 name are,\nhe claims, kinds with \u201ccommon natures, and forms not very far\napart\u201d (644b2\u20133). Prior to understanding these kinds\nthrough a scientific account of this common nature, we can\u2014as\nthe Posterior Analytics argues\u2014grasp these kinds, i.e.\ngrasp that all birds have a common\n nature.[8]\n We do this by noting that they have many general differences that\nvary in measurable ways\u2014by the more and less, as he puts it.\n\n\u2026[these kinds] are correctly defined in this way. For those\nanimals that differ by degree and the more and the less have been\nbrought together under one kind, while those that are analogous have\nbeen kept apart. I mean, for example, that bird differs from bird by\nthe more or by degree (for one has long feathers, another short\nfeathers), while fish differs from bird by analogy (for what is\nfeather in the one is scale in the other). (644a16\u201322)\n\n\nIt is with this very topic of different degrees of similarity and\ndifference of parts that the Historia Animalium begins,\nextending this way of characterizing similarity and difference\nimmediately to differences in activities, ways of life and traits of\ncharacter. (HA I 1, 486a5\u2013487a13) This is, then,\nclearly a discussion of how one achieves \u2018knowledge of the\nfact\u2019, rather than \u2018knowledge of the reason\nwhy\u2019.\n\nThe closing section of PA I (treated since the Renaissance as\nits fifth chapter) is often thought of as having two, essentially\nunrelated parts. And there is some justification for this; if one were\nto remove the first half of the chapter, one would be left with an\nargument the flows quite naturally out of the conclusion of chapter 4.\nAt that point, Aristotle states that once one has made an initial\ndivision of the attributes that belong to all the animals per\nse, the next step is to attempt \u201cto divide their\ncauses,\u201d after which he applies the analysis of sameness and\ndifference from the previous discussion of parts to the activities\nperformed by these parts. He then closes the discussion by arguing\nthat the differences we find in animal parts are to be explained by\nreference to differences found among their activities. Thus a proper\ndivision of activities is a division of the causes of the parts of\nanimals.\n\nNevertheless, a good case can be made that this \u2018chapter\u2019\nforms a coherent whole, a sort of culmination of the book. It begins\nwith perhaps the best known passage in Aristotle\u2019s biological\nworks, a stirring and beautifully crafted encomium to the joys of\nstudying animals, even the most lowly. An elegant introduction divides\nnatural beings into those that are eternal and those that partake of\ngeneration and perishing, noting that there are attractions to\nstudying both: though access to information about the former is\nlimited, he likens it to \u201c\u2026a chance, brief glimpse of the\nones we love\u201d; on the other hand the latter, perishable things\n\u201ctake the prize in respect of understanding because we know more\nof them and know them more fully\u201d and they are \u201cmore of\nour own nature\u201d (644b23\u2013645a3). He then elaborates on the\nvalue of the study of the living things around us. It is a passage\nworth quoting in full.\n\n\nSince we have completed stating the way things appear to us about the\ndivine things, it remains to speak about animal nature, omitting\nnothing in our power, whether of less or greater esteem. For even in\nthe study of animals disagreeable to perception, the nature that\ncrafted them likewise provides extraordinary pleasures to those able\nto know their causes and who are by nature philosophers. Surely it\nwould be unreasonable, even absurd, for us to enjoy studying\nlikenesses of animals\u2014on the ground that we are at the same time\nstudying the art, such as painting and sculpture, that made\nthem\u2014while not prizing even more the study of things constituted\nby nature, at least when we can behold their causes.\n\nFor this reason we should not be childishly disgusted at the\nexamination of the less valuable animals. For in all natural things\nthere is something marvelous. Even as Heraclitus is said to have\nspoken to those strangers who wished to meet him but stopped as they\nwere approaching when they saw him warming himself at the\noven\u2014he bade them to enter without fear, \u2018For there are\ngods here too\u2019\u2014so too one should approach research about\neach of the animals without disgust, since in every one there is\nsomething natural and good. For what is not haphazard but rather for\nthe sake of something is in fact present most of all in the works of\nnature; the end for the sake of which takes the place of the good. If\nsomeone considered the study of the other animals to lack value, he\nought to think the same thing about himself as well; for it is\nimpossible to look at that from which mankind has been\nconstituted\u2014blood, flesh, bones, blood vessels, and other such\nparts\u2014without considerable disgust. Just as one who discusses\nthe parts or equipment of anything should not be thought of as doing\nso in order to draw attention to the matter, nor for the sake of the\nmatter, but rather in order to draw attention to the overall shape\n(e.g. to a house rather than bricks, mortar, and timbers); likewise\none should consider the discussion of nature to be referring to the\ncomposite and the overall substantial being rather than to those\nthings which do not exist when separated from their substantial being.\n(PA I 5, 645a4\u201336)\n\n\nReaders, often carried away by the rhetoric of this passage, might\nfail to notice that there is a compelling argument here, with two key\nconclusions. The first is that, while studying the Sun, Moon, starts\nand planets may be a noble pursuit, if scientific understanding is\nyour goal, you are much more likely to achieve it in the study of\nanimals and plants: \u201c\u2026anyone wishing to labor\nsufficiently can grasp many things about each kind\u2026we know more\nof them and we know them more fully\u2026they are nearer to us and\nmore of our own nature\u2026\u201d (excerpted from\n644b29\u2013645a3). The second is that if one has the proper\nphilosophical focus, then one realizes that the somewhat unpleasant\ntask of dissecting blood vessels and the like, is a means to\nunderstanding that for the sake of which and soul,\nthose objects of inquiry argued to be primary in chapter 1. For the\nlesson of chapter 1 is that understanding living matter is achieved\nprimarily by means of an understanding of the functional goals served\nby an animal\u2019s parts, discovering what each of its parts is for,\nwhat it contributes to the life of the animal. This is the\nphilosophical way to investigate animals, and by doing so you learn\nthe value of an animal\u2019s parts and activities to its life.\n\nThe remainder of the chapter, therefore, recommends approaching the\nactivities associated with animals and their parts in a\nmanner exactly analogous to the approach to the study of parts\nrecommended in chapter 4 (645b1\u201314); and it concludes with a\nschematic discussion of the variety of teleological relationships that\nhold among parts, between parts and their\nactivities, and among activities. Aristotle encourages us to\nconceive of these relationships in a yet more unified way, as\na single complex relationship between a single complex activity\n(living, I suppose) and a single complex instrument, the\nanimal\u2019s body. (645b15\u201336)\n\nIn the first book of On the Parts of Animals, then, we have a\nsystematic philosophy of biology, which in many respects seems to\nprovide what is missing in the Analytics regarding the\napplication of its program to the study of living nature. But does\nAristotle\u2019s biological practice carry through on this program?\nIt is worthwhile keeping that question in mind as we survey those\nbooks that report the results of Aristotle\u2019s animal studies. To\nthose books we now turn. \n",
