    "preamble": "\n\nFor any person, there are some things they know, and some things they\ndon\u2019t. What exactly is the difference? What does it take to know\nsomething? It\u2019s not enough just to believe it\u2014we\ndon\u2019t know the things we\u2019re wrong about. Knowledge seems\nto be more like a way of getting at the truth. The analysis of\nknowledge concerns the attempt to articulate in what exactly this kind\nof \u201cgetting at the truth\u201d consists.\n\nMore particularly, the project of analysing knowledge is to state\nconditions that are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for\npropositional knowledge, thoroughly answering the question, what does\nit take to know something? By \u201cpropositional knowledge\u201d,\nwe mean knowledge of a proposition\u2014for example, if Susan knows\nthat Alyssa is a musician, she has knowledge of the proposition that\nAlyssa is a musician. Propositional knowledge should be distinguished\nfrom knowledge of \u201cacquaintance\u201d, as obtains when Susan\nknows Alyssa. The relation between propositional knowledge and the\nknowledge at issue in other \u201cknowledge\u201d locutions in\nEnglish, such as knowledge-where (\u201cSusan knows where she\nis\u201d) and especially knowledge-how (\u201cSusan knows how to\nride a bicycle\u201d) is subject to some debate (see Stanley 2011 and\nhis opponents discussed therein).\n\nThe propositional knowledge that is the analysandum of the analysis of\nknowledge literature is paradigmatically expressed in English by\nsentences of the form \u201cS knows that p\u201d,\nwhere \u201cS\u201d refers to the knowing subject, and\n\u201cp\u201d to the proposition that is known. A proposed\nanalysis consists of a statement of the following form: S knows\nthat p if and only if j, where j indicates the\nanalysans: paradigmatically, a list of conditions that are\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient for S to have\nknowledge that p.\n\nIt is not enough merely to pick out the actual extension of knowledge.\nEven if, in actual fact, all cases of S knowing that p\nare cases of j, and all cases of the latter are cases of the\nformer, j might fail as an analysis of knowledge. For example,\nit might be that there are possible cases of knowledge\nwithout j, or vice versa. A proper analysis of knowledge should\nat least be a necessary truth. Consequently, hypothetical thought\nexperiments provide appropriate test cases for various analyses, as we\nshall see below.\n\nEven a necessary biconditional linking knowledge to some state\nj would probably not be sufficient for an analysis of\nknowledge, although just what more is required is a matter of some\ncontroversy. According to some theorists, to analyze knowledge is\nliterally to identify the components that make up\nknowledge\u2014compare a chemist who analyzes a sample to learn its\nchemical composition. On this interpretation of the project of\nanalyzing knowledge, the defender of a successful analysis of\nknowledge will be committed to something like the metaphysical claim\nthat what it is for S to know p is for some\nlist of conditions involving S and p to obtain. Other\ntheorists think of the analysis of knowledge as distinctively\nconceptual\u2014to analyse knowledge is to limn the\nstructure of the concept of knowledge. On one version of this\napproach, the concept knowledge is literally composed of more\nbasic concepts, linked together by something like Boolean operators.\nConsequently, an analysis is subject not only to extensional accuracy,\nbut to facts about the cognitive representation of knowledge and other\nepistemic notions. In practice, many epistemologists engaging in the\nproject of analyzing knowledge leave these metaphilosophical\ninterpretive questions unresolved; attempted analyses, and\ncounterexamples thereto, are often proposed without its being made\nexplicit whether the claims are intended as metaphysical or conceptual\nones. In many cases, this lack of specificity may be legitimate, since\nall parties tend to agree that an analysis of knowledge ought at\nleast to be extensionally correct in all metaphysically possible\nworlds. As we shall see, many theories have been defended and,\nespecially, refuted, on those terms.\n\nThe attempt to analyze knowledge has received a considerable amount of\nattention from epistemologists, particularly in the late\n20th Century, but no analysis has been widely accepted.\nSome contemporary epistemologists reject the assumption that knowledge\nis susceptible to analysis.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Knowledge as Justified True Belief\n\nThere are three components to the traditional\n(\u201ctripartite\u201d) analysis of knowledge. According to this\nanalysis, justified, true belief is necessary and sufficient for\nknowledge.\n\nThe Tripartite Analysis of Knowledge:\nS knows that p iff\n\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS is justified in believing that p.\n\n\n\nThe tripartite analysis of knowledge is often abbreviated as the\n\u201cJTB\u201d analysis, for \u201cjustified true\nbelief\u201d.\n\nMuch of the twentieth-century literature on the analysis of knowledge\ntook the JTB analysis as its starting-point. It became something of a\nconvenient fiction to suppose that this analysis was widely accepted\nthroughout much of the history of philosophy. In fact, however, the\nJTB analysis was first articulated in the twentieth century by its\n attackers.[1]\n Before turning to influential twentieth-century\narguments against the JTB theory, let us briefly consider the three\ntraditional components of knowledge in turn.\n1.1 The Truth Condition\n\nMost epistemologists have found it overwhelmingly plausible that what\nis false cannot be known. For example, Hillary Clinton did not win the\n2016 US Presidential election. Consequently, nobody knows that Hillary\nClinton won the election. One can only know things that are true.\n\nSometimes when people are very confident of something that turns out\nto be wrong, we use the word \u201cknows\u201d to describe their\nsituation. Many people expected Clinton to win the election. Speaking\nloosely, one might even say that many people \u201cknew\u201d that\nClinton would win the election\u2014until she lost. Hazlett (2010)\nargues on the basis of data like this that \u201cknows\u201d is not\na factive\n verb.[2]\n Hazlett\u2019s diagnosis is deeply controversial; most\nepistemologists will treat sentences like \u201cI knew that Clinton\nwas going to win\u201d as a kind of exaggeration\u2014as not\nliterally true.\n\nSomething\u2019s truth does not require that anyone can know or prove\nthat it is true. Not all truths are established truths. If\nyou flip a coin and never check how it landed, it may be true that it\nlanded heads, even if nobody has any way to tell. Truth is a\nmetaphysical, as opposed to epistemological, notion:\ntruth is a matter of how things are, not how they can be\nshown to be. So when we say that only true things can be\nknown, we\u2019re not (yet) saying anything about how anyone can\naccess the truth. As we\u2019ll see, the other conditions\nhave important roles to play here. Knowledge is a kind of relationship\nwith the truth\u2014to know something is to have a certain kind of\naccess to a\n fact.[3]\n1.2 The Belief Condition\n\nThe belief condition is only slightly more controversial than the\ntruth condition. The general idea behind the belief condition is that\nyou can only know what you believe. Failing to believe something\nprecludes knowing it. \u201cBelief\u201d in the context of the JTB\ntheory means full belief, or outright belief. In a\nweak sense, one might \u201cbelieve\u201d something by virtue of\nbeing pretty confident that it\u2019s probably true\u2014in this\nweak sense, someone who considered Clinton the favourite to win the\nelection, even while recognizing a nontrivial possibility of her\nlosing, might be said to have \u201cbelieved\u201d that Clinton would win.\nOutright belief is stronger (see, e.g., Fantl & McGrath 2009: 141;\nNagel 2010: 413\u20134; Williamson 2005: 108; or Gibbons 2013: 201.).\nTo believe outright that p, it isn\u2019t enough to have a\npretty high confidence in p; it is something closer to a\ncommitment or a being\n sure.[4]\n\nAlthough initially it might seem obvious that knowing that p\nrequires believing that p, a few philosophers have argued that\nknowledge without belief is indeed possible. Suppose Walter comes home\nafter work to find out that his house has burned down. He says:\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u201d. Critics of the belief\ncondition might argue that Walter knows that his house has burned down\n(he sees that it has), but, as his words indicate, he does not believe\nit. The standard response is that Walter\u2019s avowal of disbelief\nis not literally true; what Walter wishes to convey by saying \u201cI\ndon\u2019t believe it\u201d is not that he really does not believe\nthat his house has burned down, but rather that he finds it hard to\ncome to terms with what he sees. If he genuinely didn\u2019t believe\nit, some of his subsequent actions, such as phoning his insurance\ncompany, would be rather mysterious.\n\nA more serious counterexample has been suggested by Colin Radford\n(1966). Suppose Albert is quizzed on English history. One of the\nquestions is: \u201cWhen did Queen Elizabeth die?\u201d Albert\ndoesn\u2019t think he knows, but answers the question correctly.\nMoreover, he gives correct answers to many other questions to which he\ndidn\u2019t think he knew the answer. Let us focus on Albert\u2019s\nanswer to the question about Elizabeth:\n\n(E)Elizabeth died in\n1603.\n\n\nRadford makes the following two claims about this example:\n\nAlbert does not believe (E).\nAlbert knows (E).\n\n\nRadford\u2019s intuitions about cases like these do not seem to be\nidiosyncratic; Myers-Schutz & Schwitzgebel (2013) find evidence\nsuggesting that many ordinary speakers tend to react in the way\nRadford suggests. In support of (a), Radford emphasizes that Albert\nthinks he doesn\u2019t know the answer to the question. He\ndoesn\u2019t trust his answer because he takes it to be a mere guess.\nIn support of (b), Radford argues that Albert\u2019s answer is not at\nall just a lucky guess. The fact that he answers most of the questions\ncorrectly indicates that he has actually learned, and never forgotten,\nsuch historical facts.\n\nSince he takes (a) and (b) to be true, Radford holds that belief is not necessary for knowledge. But either of (a) and (b) might be resisted. One might deny (a), arguing that Albert does have a tacit belief that (E), even though it\u2019s not one that he thinks amounts to knowledge. David Rose and Jonathan Schaffer (2013) take this route. Alternatively, one might deny (b), arguing that Albert\u2019s correct answer is not an expression of knowledge, perhaps because, given his subjective position, he does not have justification for believing (E). The justification condition is the topic of the next section.\n \n1.3 The Justification Condition\n\nWhy is condition (iii) necessary? Why not say that knowledge is true\nbelief? The standard answer is that to identify knowledge with true\nbelief would be implausible because a belief might be true even though\nit is formed improperly. Suppose that William flips a coin, and\nconfidently believes\u2014on no particular basis\u2014that it will\nland tails. If by chance the coin does land tails, then\nWilliam\u2019s belief was true; but a lucky guess such as this one is\nno knowledge. For William to know, his belief must in some epistemic\nsense be proper or appropriate: it must be\n justified.[5]\n\nSocrates articulates the need for something like a justification\ncondition in Plato\u2019s Theaetetus, when he points out\nthat \u201ctrue opinion\u201d is in general insufficient for\nknowledge. For example, if a lawyer employs sophistry to induce a jury\ninto a belief that happens to be true, this belief is insufficiently\nwell-grounded to constitute knowledge.\n1.3.1 Approaches to Justification\n\nThere is considerable disagreement among epistemologists concerning\nwhat the relevant sort of justification here consists in.\nInternalists about justification think that whether a belief\nis justified depends wholly on states in some sense internal\nto the subject. According to one common such sense of\n\u201cinternal\u201d, only those features of a subject\u2019s\nexperience which are directly or introspectively available count as\n\u201cinternal\u201d\u2014call this \u201caccess\ninternalism\u201d. According to another, only intrinsic states of the\nsubject are \u201cinternal\u201d\u2014call this \u201cstate\ninternalism\u201d. See Feldman & Conee 2001\nfor the distinction.\n\nConee and Feldman present an example of an internalist view. They have\nit that S\u2019s belief that p is justified if and only\nif believing that p is the attitude towards p that best\nfits S\u2019s evidence, where the latter is understood to\ndepend only on S\u2019s internal mental states. Conee and\nFeldman call their view \u201cevidentialism\u201d, and characterize\nthis as the thesis that justification is wholly a matter of the\nsubject\u2019s evidence. Given their (not unsubstantial) assumption\nthat what evidence a subject has is an internal matter, evidentialism\nimplies\n internalism.[6]\nExternalists about justification think that factors external\nto the subject can be relevant for justification; for example, process\nreliabilists think that justified beliefs are those which are formed\nby a cognitive process which tends to produce a high proportion of\ntrue beliefs relative to false\n ones.[7]\n We shall return to the question of how reliabilist approaches bear on\nthe analysis of knowledge in\n \u00a76.1.\n1.3.2 Kinds of Justification\n\nIt is worth noting that one might distinguish between two importantly\ndifferent notions of justification, standardly referred to as\n\u201cpropositional justification\u201d and \u201cdoxastic\njustification\u201d. (Sometimes \u201cex ante\u201d\njustification and \u201cex post\u201d justification,\n respectively.)[8]\n Unlike that between internalist and externalist approaches to\njustification, the distinction between propositional and doxastic\njustification does not represent a conflict to be resolved; it is a\ndistinction between two distinct properties that are called\n\u201cjustification\u201d. Propositional justification concerns\nwhether a subject has sufficient reason to believe a given\n proposition;[9]\n doxastic justification concerns whether a given belief is held\n appropriately.[10]\n One common way of relating the two is to suggest that propositional\njustification is the more fundamental, and that doxastic justification\nis a matter of a subject\u2019s having a belief that is appropriately\nresponsive to or based on their propositional justification.\n\nThe precise relation between propositional and doxastic justification\nis subject to controversy, but it is uncontroversial that the two\nnotions can come apart. Suppose that Ingrid ignores a great deal of\nexcellent evidence indicating that a given neighborhood is dangerous,\nbut superstitiously comes to believe that the neighborhood is\ndangerous when she sees a black cat crossing the street. Since forming\nbeliefs on the basis of superstition is not an epistemically\nappropriate way of forming beliefs, Ingrid\u2019s belief is not\ndoxastically justified; nevertheless, she does have good\nreason to believe as she does, so she does have propositional\njustification for the proposition that the neighborhood is\ndangerous.\n\nSince knowledge is a particularly successful kind of belief, doxastic\njustification is a stronger candidate for being closely related to\nknowledge; the JTB theory is typically thought to invoke doxastic\njustification (but see Lowy 1978).\n2. Lightweight Knowledge\n\nSome epistemologists have suggested that there may be multiple senses\nof the term \u201cknowledge\u201d, and that not all of them require\nall three elements of the tripartite theory of knowledge. For example,\nsome have argued that there is, in addition to the sense of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d gestured at above, another, weak\nsense of \u201cknowledge\u201d, that requires only true belief (see\nfor example Hawthorne 2002 and Goldman & Olsson 2009; the latter\ncontains additional relevant references). This view is sometimes\nmotivated by the thought that, when we consider whether someone knows\nthat p, or wonder which of a group of people know that\np, often, we are not at all interested in whether the relevant\nsubjects have beliefs that are justified; we just want to know whether\nthey have the true belief. For example, as Hawthorne (2002:\n253\u201354) points out, one might ask how many students know that\nVienna is the capital of Austria; the correct answer, one might think,\njust is the number of students who offer \u201cVienna\u201d as the\nanswer to the corresponding question, irrespective of whether their\nbeliefs are justified. Similarly, if you are planning a surprise party\nfor Eugene and ask whether he knows about it, \u201cyes\u201d may be\nan appropriate answer merely on the grounds that Eugene believes that\nyou are planning a party.\n\nOne could allow that there is a lightweight sense of knowledge that\nrequires only true belief; another option is to decline to accept the\nintuitive sentences as true at face value. A theorist might, for\ninstance, deny that sentences like \u201cEugene knows that you are\nplanning a party\u201d, or \u201ceighteen students know that Vienna\nis the capital of Austria\u201d are literally true in the envisaged\nsituations, explaining away their apparent felicity as loose talk or\nhyperbole.\n\nEven among those epistemologists who think that there is a lightweight\nsense of \u201cknows\u201d that does not require justification, most\ntypically admit that there is also a stronger sense which does, and\nthat it is this stronger state that is the main target of\nepistemological theorizing about knowledge. In what follows, we will\nset aside the lightweight sense, if indeed there be one, and focus on\nthe stronger one.\n3. The Gettier Problem\n\nFew contemporary epistemologists accept the adequacy of the JTB\nanalysis. Although most agree that each element of the tripartite\ntheory is necessary for knowledge, they do not seem\ncollectively to be sufficient. There seem to be cases of\njustified true belief that still fall short of knowledge. Here is one\nkind of example:\n\n\nImagine that we are seeking water on a hot day. We suddenly see water,\nor so we think. In fact, we are not seeing water but a mirage, but\nwhen we reach the spot, we are lucky and find water right there under\na rock. Can we say that we had genuine knowledge of water? The answer\nseems to be negative, for we were just lucky. (quoted from Dreyfus\n1997: 292)\n\n\nThis example comes from the Indian philosopher Dharmottara, c. 770 CE.\nThe 14th-century Italian philosopher Peter of Mantua\npresented a similar case:\n\n\nLet it be assumed that Plato is next to you and you know him to be\nrunning, but you mistakenly believe that he is Socrates, so that you\nfirmly believe that Socrates is running. However, let it be so that\nSocrates is in fact running in Rome; however, you do not know this.\n(from Peter of Mantua\u2019s De scire et dubitare, given in\nBoh 1985: 95)\n\n\nCases like these, in which justified true belief seems in some\nimportant sense disconnected from the fact, were made famous in Edmund\nGettier\u2019s 1963 paper, \u201cIs Justified True Belief\nKnowledge?\u201d. Gettier presented two cases in which a true belief\nis inferred from a justified false belief. He observed that,\nintuitively, such beliefs cannot be knowledge; it is merely lucky that\nthey are true.\n\nIn honour of his contribution to the literature, cases like these have\ncome to be known as \u201cGettier cases\u201d. Since they appear to\nrefute the JTB analysis, many epistemologists have undertaken to\nrepair it: how must the analysis of knowledge be modified to\naccommodate Gettier cases? This is what is commonly referred to as the\n\u201cGettier problem\u201d.\n\nAbove, we noted that one role of the justification is to rule out\nlucky guesses as cases of knowledge. A lesson of the Gettier problem\nis that it appears that even true beliefs that are justified can\nnevertheless be epistemically lucky in a way inconsistent with\nknowledge.\n\nEpistemologists who think that the JTB approach is basically on the\nright track must choose between two different strategies for solving\nthe Gettier problem. The first is to strengthen the justification\ncondition to rule out Gettier cases as cases of justified belief. This\nwas attempted by Roderick\n Chisholm;[11]\n we will refer to this strategy again in\n \u00a77\n below. The other is to amend the JTB analysis with a suitable fourth\ncondition, a condition that succeeds in preventing justified true\nbelief from being \u201cgettiered\u201d. Thus amended, the JTB\nanalysis becomes a JTB+X account of knowledge, where the\n\u201cX\u201d stands for the needed fourth condition.\n\nLet us consider an instance of this attempt to articulate a\n\u201cdegettiering\u201d condition.\n4. No False Lemmas\n\nAccording to one suggestion, the following fourth condition would do\nthe trick:\n\nS\u2019s belief that p is not inferred from any\n falsehood.[12]\n\n\nIn Gettier\u2019s cases, the justified true belief is inferred from a\njustified false belief. So condition (iv) explains why it isn\u2019t\nknowledge. However, this \u201cno false lemmas\u201d proposal is not\nsuccessful in general. There are examples of Gettier cases that need\ninvolve no inference; therefore, there are possible cases of justified\ntrue belief without knowledge, even though condition (iv) is met.\nSuppose, for example, that James, who is relaxing on a bench in a\npark, observes an apparent dog in a nearby field. So he believes\n\nThere is a dog in the field.\n\n\nSuppose further that the putative dog is actually a robot dog so\nperfect that it could not be distinguished from an actual dog by\nvision alone. James does not know that such robot dogs exist; a\nJapanese toy manufacturer has only recently developed them, and what\nJames sees is a prototype that is used for testing the public\u2019s\nresponse. Given these assumptions, (d) is of course false. But suppose\nfurther that just a few feet away from the robot dog, there is a real\ndog, concealed from James\u2019s view. Given this further assumption,\nJames\u2019s belief in (d) is true. And since this belief is based on\nordinary perceptual processes, most epistemologists will agree that it\nis justified. But as in Gettier\u2019s cases, James\u2019s\nbelief appears to be true only as a matter of luck, in a way\ninconsistent with knowledge. So once again, what we have before us is\na justified true belief that isn\u2019t\n knowledge.[13]\n Arguably, this belief is directly justified by a visual experience;\nit is not inferred from any falsehood. If so, then the JTB account,\neven if supplemented with (iv), gives us the wrong result that James\nknows (d).\n\nAnother case illustrating that clause (iv) won\u2019t do the job is\nthe well-known Barn County case (Goldman 1976). Suppose there is a\ncounty in the Midwest with the following peculiar feature. The\nlandscape next to the road leading through that county is peppered\nwith barn-facades: structures that from the road look exactly like\nbarns. Observation from any other viewpoint would immediately reveal\nthese structures to be fakes: devices erected for the purpose of\nfooling unsuspecting motorists into believing in the presence of\nbarns. Suppose Henry is driving along the road that leads through Barn\nCounty. Naturally, he will on numerous occasions form false beliefs in\nthe presence of barns. Since Henry has no reason to suspect that he is\nthe victim of organized deception, these beliefs are justified. Now\nsuppose further that, on one of those occasions when he believes there\nis a barn over there, he happens to be looking at the one and only\nreal barn in the county. This time, his belief is justified and true.\nBut since its truth is the result of luck, it is exceedingly plausible\nto judge that Henry\u2019s belief is not an instance of knowledge.\nYet condition (iv) is met in this case. His belief is not the result\nof any inference from a falsehood. Once again, we see that (iv) does\nnot succeed as a general solution to the Gettier problem.\n5. Modal Conditions\n5.1 Sensitivity\n\nAnother candidate fourth condition on knowledge is\nsensitivity. Sensitivity, to a first approximation, is this\ncounterfactual relation:\n\n\nS\u2019s belief that p is sensitive if and only if, if\np were false, S would not believe that\n p.[14]\n\n\nA sensitivity condition on knowledge was defended by Robert Nozick\n(1981). Given a Lewisian (Lewis 1973) semantics for counterfactual\nconditionals, the sensitivity condition is equivalent to the\nrequirement that, in the nearest possible worlds in which\nnot-p, the subject does not believe that p.\n\nOne motivation for including a sensitivity condition in an analysis of\nknowledge is that there seems to be an intuitive sense in which\nknowledge requires not merely being correct, but tracking the\ntruth in other possible circumstances. This approach seems to be a\nplausible diagnosis of what goes wrong in at least some Gettier cases.\nFor example, in Dharmottara\u2019s desert water case, your belief\nthat there is water in a certain location appears to be insensitive to\nthe fact of the water. For if there were no water there, you would\nhave held the same belief on the same grounds\u2014viz., the\nmirage.\n\nHowever, it is doubtful that a sensitivity condition can account for\nthe phenomenon of Gettier cases in general. It does so only in cases\nin which, had the proposition in question been false, it would have\nbeen believed anyway. But, as Saul Kripke (2011: 167\u201368) has\npointed out, not all Gettier cases are like this. Consider for\ninstance the Barn County case mentioned above. Henry looks at a\nparticular location where there happens to be a barn and believes\nthere to be a barn there. The sensitivity condition rules out this\nbelief as knowledge only if, were there no barn there, Henry would\nstill have believed there was. But this counterfactual may be false,\ndepending on how the Barn County case is set up. For instance, it is\nfalse if the particular location Henry is examining is not one that\nwould have been suitable for the erecting of a barn fa\u00e7ade.\nRelatedly, as Kripke has also indicated (2011: 186), if we suppose\nthat barn facades are always green, but genuine barns are always red,\nHenry\u2019s belief that he sees a red barn will be\nsensitive, even though his belief that he sees a barn will\nnot. (We assume Henry is unaware that colour signifies anything\nrelevant.) Since intuitively, the former belief looks to fall short of\nknowledge in just the same way as the latter, a sensitivity condition\nwill only handle some of the intuitive problems deriving from Gettier\ncases.\n\nMost epistemologists today reject sensitivity requirements on\nknowledge. The chief motivation against a sensitivity condition is\nthat, given plausible assumptions, it leads to unacceptable\nimplications called \u201cabominable \n conjunctions\u201d.[15]\n To see this, suppose first that\nskepticism about ordinary knowledge is false\u2014ordinary subjects\nknow at least many of the things we ordinarily take them to know. For\nexample, George, who can see and use his hands perfectly well, knows\nthat he has hands. This is of course perfectly consistent with a\nsensitivity condition on knowledge, since if George did not\nhave hands\u2014if they\u2019d been recently chopped off, for\ninstance\u2014he would not believe that he had hands.\n\nNow imagine a skeptical scenario in which George does not have hands.\nSuppose that George is the victim of a Cartesian demon, deceiving him\ninto believing that he has hands. If George were in such a scenario,\nof course, he would falsely believe himself not to be in such a\nscenario. So given the sensitivity condition, George cannot know that\nhe is not in such a scenario.\n\nAlthough these two verdicts\u2014the knowledge-attributing one about\nordinary knowledge, and the knowledge-denying one about the skeptical\nscenario\u2014are arguably each intuitive, it is intuitively\nproblematic to hold them together. Their conjunction is, in\nDeRose\u2019s term, abominable: \u201cGeorge knows that he has\nhands, but he doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s not the handless\nvictim of a Cartesian demon\u201d. A sensitivity condition on\nknowledge, combined with the nonskeptical claim that there is ordinary\nknowledge, seems to imply such abominable\n conjunctions.[16]\n\nMost contemporary epistemologists have taken considerations like these\nto be sufficient reason to reject sensitivity \n conditions.[17]\n However, see\nIchikawa (2011a) for an interpretation and endorsement of the\nsensitivity condition according to which it may avoid commitment to\nabominable conjunctions.\n5.2 Safety\n\nAlthough few epistemologists today endorse a sensitivity condition on\nknowledge, the idea that knowledge requires a subject to stand in a\nparticular modal relation to the proposition known remains a popular\none. In his 1999 paper, \u201cHow to Defeat Opposition to\nMoore\u201d, Ernest Sosa proposed that a safety condition\nought to take the role that sensitivity was intended to play. Sosa\ncharacterized safety as the counterfactual contrapositive of\nsensitivity.\n\nSensitivity:\nIf p were false, S would not believe that p.\n\n\nSafety:\nIf S were to believe that p, p would not be\n false.[18]\n\nAlthough contraposition is valid for the material conditional \\((A\n\\supset B\\) iff \\(\\mathord{\\sim} B \\supset \\mathord{\\sim}A)\\),\nSosa suggests that it is invalid for counterfactuals, which is why\nsensitivity and safety are not equivalent. An example of a safe belief\nthat is not sensitive, according to Sosa, is the belief that a distant\nskeptical scenario does not obtain. If we stipulate that George,\ndiscussed above, has never been at risk of being the victim of a\nCartesian demon\u2014because, say, Cartesian demons do not exist in\nGeorge\u2019s world\u2014then George\u2019s belief that he is not\nsuch a victim is a safe one, even though we saw in the previous\nsection that it could not be sensitive. Notice that although we\nstipulated that George is not at risk of deceit by Cartesian demons,\nwe did not stipulate that George himself had any particular\naccess to this fact. Unless he does, safety, like sensitivity, will be\nan externalist condition on knowledge in the\n\u201caccess\u201d sense. It is also externalist in the\n\u201cstate\u201d sense, since the truth of the relevant\ncounterfactuals will depend on features outside the subject.\n\nCharacterizing safety in these counterfactual terms depends on\nsubstantive assumptions about the semantics of counterfactual\n conditionals.[19]\n If we were to accept, for instance, David Lewis\u2019s or Robert\nStalnaker\u2019s treatment of counterfactuals, including a strong\ncentering condition according to which the actual world is always\nuniquely closest, all true beliefs would count as safe according to\nthe counterfactual analysis of\n safety.[20]\n Sosa intends the relevant counterfactuals to be making a stronger\nclaim, requiring roughly that in all nearby worlds in which\nS believes that p, p is not false.\n\nRather than resting on a contentious treatment of counterfactuals,\nthen, it may be most perspicuous to understand the safety condition\nmore directly in these modal terms, as Sosa himself often does:\n\n\nSafety:\n\nIn all nearby worlds where S believes that p, p\nis not false.\n\n\nWhether a JTB+safety analysis of knowledge could be successful is\nsomewhat difficult to evaluate, given the vagueness of the stated\n\u201cnearby\u201d condition. The status of potential\ncounterexamples will not always be straightforward to apply. For\nexample, Juan Comesa\u00f1a (2005) presents a case he takes to\nrefute the requirement that knowledge be safe. In\nComesa\u00f1a\u2019s example, the host of a Halloween party enlists\nJudy to direct guests to the party. Judy\u2019s instructions are to\ngive everyone the same directions, which are in fact accurate, but\nthat if she sees Michael, the party will be moved to another location.\n(The host does not want Michael to find the party.) Suppose Michael\nnever shows up. If a given guest does not, but very nearly does,\ndecide to wear a very realistic Michael costume to the party, then his\nbelief, based in Judy\u2019s testimony, about the whereabouts of the\nparty will be true, but could, Comesa\u00f1a says, easily have been\nfalse. (Had he merely made a slightly different choice about his\ncostume, he would have been deceived.) Comesa\u00f1a describes the\ncase as a counterexample to a safety condition on knowledge. However,\nit is open to a safety theorist to argue that the relevant skeptical\nscenario, though possible and in some sense nearby, is not\nnear enough in the relevant respect to falsify the safety condition.\nSuch a theorist would, if she wanted the safety condition to deliver\nclear verdicts, face the task of articulating just what the relevant\nnotion of similarity amounts to (see also Bogardus 2014).\n\nNot all further clarifications of a safety condition will be suitable\nfor the use of the latter in an analysis of knowledge. In particular,\nif the respect of similarity that is relevant for safety is itself\nexplicated in terms of knowledge, then an analysis of knowledge which\nmade reference to safety would be in this respect circular. This, for\ninstance, is how Timothy Williamson characterizes safety. He writes,\nin response to a challenge by Alvin Goldman:\n\n\nIn many cases, someone with no idea of what knowledge is would be\nunable to determine whether safety obtained. Although they could use\nthe principle that safety entails truth to exclude some cases, those\nare not the interesting ones. Thus Goldman will be disappointed when\nhe asks what the safety account predicts about various examples in\nwhich conflicting considerations pull in different directions. One may\nhave to decide whether safety obtains by first deciding whether\nknowledge obtains, rather than vice versa. (Williamson 2009: 305)\n\n\nBecause safety is understood only in terms of knowledge, safety so\nunderstood cannot serve in an analysis of knowledge. Nor is it\nWilliamson\u2019s intent that it should do so; as we will see below,\nWilliamson rejects the project of analyzing knowledge. This is of\ncourse consistent with claiming that safety is a necessary condition\non knowledge in the straightforward sense that the latter entails the\nformer.\n5.3 Relevant Alternatives\n\nA third approach to modal conditions on knowledge worthy of mention is\nthe requirement that for a subject to know that p, she must\nrule out all \u201crelevant alternatives\u201d to p.\nSignificant early proponents of this view include Stine 1976, Goldman\n1976, and Dretske 1981. The idea behind this approach to knowledge is\nthat for a subject to know that p, she must be able to\n\u201crule out\u201d competing hypotheses to p\u2014but that only\nsome subset of all not-p possibilities are \u201crelevant\u201d for\nknowledge attributions. Consider for example, the differences between\nthe several models that have been produced of Apple\u2019s iPhone. To\nbe able to know by sight that a particular phone is the 6S model, it\nis natural to suppose that one must be able to tell the difference\nbetween the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 7; the possibility that the phone\nin question is a newer model is a relevant alternative. But perhaps\nthere are other possibilities in which the belief that there is an\niPhone 6S is false that do not need to be ruled out\u2014perhaps, for\ninstance, the possibility that the phone is not an iPhone, but a\nChinese knock-off, needn\u2019t be considered. Likewise for the\npossibility that there is no phone at all, the phone-like appearances\nbeing the product of a Cartesian demon\u2019s machinations. Notice\nthat in these cases and many of the others that motivate the\nrelevant-alternatives approach to knowledge, there is an intuitive\nsense in which the relevant alternatives tend to be more\nsimilar to actuality than irrelevant ones. As such, the\nrelevant alternatives theory and safety-theoretic approaches are very\nsimilar, both in verdict and in spirit. As in the case of a safety\ntheorist, the relevant alternatives theorist faces a challenge in\nattempting to articulate what determines which possibilities are\nrelevant in a given\n situation.[21]\n6. Doing Without Justification?\n\nAs we have seen, one motivation for including a justification\ncondition in an analysis of knowledge was to prevent lucky guesses\nfrom counting as knowledge. However, the Gettier problem shows that\nincluding a justification condition does not rule out all\nepistemically problematic instances of luck. Consequently, some\nepistemologists have suggested that positing a justification condition\non knowledge was a false move; perhaps it is some other condition that\nought to be included along with truth and belief as components of\nknowledge. This kind of strategy was advanced by a number of authors\nfrom the late 1960s to the early 1980s, although there has been\nrelatively little discussion of it\n since.[22]\n Kornblith 2008 provides a notable exception.\n6.1 Reliabilist Theories of Knowledge\n\nOne candidate property for such a state is reliability. Part\nof what is problematic about lucky guesses is precisely that they are\nso lucky: such guesses are formed in a way such that it is unlikely\nthat they should turn out true. According to a certain form of\nknowledge reliabilism, it is unreliability, not lack of justification,\nwhich prevents such beliefs from amounting to knowledge. Reliabilist\ntheories of knowledge incorporate this idea into a reliability\ncondition on\n knowledge.[23]\n Here is an example of such a view:\n\n\nSimple K-Reliabilism:\n\nS knows that p iff\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS\u2019s belief that p was produced by a reliable\ncognitive process.\n\n\n\nSimple K-Reliabilism replaces the justification clause in the\ntraditional tripartite theory with a reliability clause. As we have\nseen, reliabilists about justification think that justification for a\nbelief consists in a genesis in a reliable cognitive process. Given\nthis view, Simple K-Reliabilism and the JTB theory are equivalent.\nHowever, the present proposal is silent on justification. Goldman 1979\nis the seminal defense of reliabilism about justification; reliabilism\nis extended to knowledge in Goldman 1986. See Goldman 2011 for a\nsurvey of reliabilism in general.\n\nIn the following passage, Fred Dretske articulates how an approach\nlike K-reliabilism might be motivated:\n\n\nThose who think knowledge requires something other than, or\nat least more than, reliably produced true belief, something\n(usually) in the way of justification for the belief that one\u2019s\nreliably produced beliefs are being reliably produced, have,\nit seems to me, an obligation to say what benefits this justification\nis supposed to confer\u2026. Who needs it, and why? If an animal\ninherits a perfectly reliable belief-generating mechanism, and it also\ninherits a disposition, everything being equal, to act on the\nbasis of the beliefs so generated, what additional benefits are\nconferred by a justification that the beliefs are being\nproduced in some reliable way? If there are no additional benefits,\nwhat good is this justification? Why should we insist that no one can\nhave knowledge without it? (Dretske 1989: 95)\n\n\nAccording to Dretske, reliable cognitive processes convey information,\nand thus endow not only humans, but (nonhuman) animals as well, with\nknowledge. He writes:\n\n\nI wanted a characterization that would at least allow for the\npossibility that animals (a frog, rat, ape, or my dog) could know\nthings without my having to suppose them capable of the more\nsophisticated intellectual operations involved in traditional analyses\nof knowledge. (Dretske 1985: 177)\n\n\nIt does seem odd to think of frogs, rats, or dogs as having justified\nor unjustified beliefs. Yet attributing knowledge to animals is\ncertainly in accord with our ordinary practice of using the word\n\u201cknowledge\u201d. So if, with Dretske, we want an account of\nknowledge that includes animals among the knowing subjects, we might\nwant to abandon the traditional JTB account in favor of something like\nK-reliabilism.\n6.2 Causal Theories of Knowledge\n\nAnother move in a similar spirit to K-Reliabilism replaces the\njustification clause in the JTB theory with a condition requiring a\ncausal connection between the belief and the fact\n believed;[24]\n this is the approach of Goldman (1967,\n 1976).[25]\n Goldman\u2019s own causal theory is a sophisticated one; we will not\nengage with its details here. See Goldman\u2019s papers. Instead,\nconsider a simplified causal theory of knowledge, which illustrates\nthe main motivation behind causal theories.\n\n\nSimple Causal Theory of Knowledge:\n\nS knows that p iff\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS\u2019s belief that p is caused by the fact that\np.\n\n\n\nDo approaches like Simple K-Reliabilism or the Simple Causal Theory\nfare any better than the JTB theory with respect to Gettier cases?\nAlthough some proponents have suggested they do\u2014see e.g.,\nDretske 1985: 179; Plantinga 1993: 48\u2014many of the standard\ncounterexamples to the JTB theory appear to refute these views as\nwell. Consider again the case of the barn facades. Henry sees a real\nbarn, and that\u2019s why he believes there is a barn nearby. This\nbelief is formed by perceptual processes, which are by-and-large\nreliable: only rarely do they lead him into false beliefs. So it looks\nlike the case meets the conditions of Simple K-Reliabilism just as\nmuch as it does those of the JTB theory. It is also a counterexample\nto the causal theory, since the real barn Henry perceives is causally\nresponsible for his belief. There is reason to doubt, therefore, that\nshifting from justification to a condition like reliability will\nescape the Gettier\n problem.[26]\n Gettier cases seem to pose as much of a problem for K-reliabilism and\ncausal theories as for the JTB account. Neither theory, unless amended\nwith a clever \u201cdegettiering\u201d clause, succeeds in stating\nsufficient conditions for\n knowledge.[27]\n7. Is Knowledge Analyzable?\n\nGettier\u2019s paper launched a flurry of philosophical activity by\nepistemologists attempting to revise the JTB theory, usually by adding\none or more conditions, to close the gap between knowledge and\njustified true belief. We have seen already how several of these\nattempts failed. When intuitive counterexamples were proposed to each\ntheory, epistemologists often responded by amending their theories,\ncomplicating the existing conditions or adding new ones. Much of this\ndialectic is chronicled thoroughly by Shope 1983, to which the\ninterested reader is directed.\n\nAfter some decades of such iterations, some epistemologists began to\ndoubt that progress was being made. In her 1994 paper, \u201cThe\nInescapability of Gettier Problems\u201d, Linda Zagzebski suggested\nthat no analysis sufficiently similar to the JTB analysis could ever\navoid the problems highlighted by Gettier\u2019s cases. More\nprecisely, Zagzebski argued, any analysans of the form JTB+X,\nwhere X is a condition or list of conditions logically\nindependent from justification, truth, and belief, would be\nsusceptible to Gettier-style counterexamples. She offered what was in\neffect a recipe for constructing Gettier cases:\n\n(1)Start with an\nexample of a case where a subject has a justified false belief that\nalso meets condition X.\n(2)Modify the case so\nthat the belief is true merely by luck.\n\n\nZagzebski suggests that the resultant case will always represent an\nintuitive lack of knowledge. So any non-redundant addition to the JTB\ntheory will leave the Gettier problem\n unsolved.[28]\n We may illustrate the application of the recipe using one of\nZagzebski\u2019s own examples, refuting Alvin Plantinga\u2019s\n(1996) attempt to solve the Gettier problem by appending to the JTB\nanalysis a condition requiring that the subject\u2019s faculties be\nworking properly in an appropriate environment.\n\nIn step one of Zagzebski\u2019s procedure, we imagine a case in which\na subject\u2019s faculties are working properly in an appropriate\nenvironment, but the ensuing belief, though justified, is false.\nZagzebski invites us to imagine that Mary has very good\neyesight\u2014good enough for her cognitive faculties typically to\nyield knowledge that her husband is sitting in the living room. Such\nfaculties, even when working properly in suitable environments,\nhowever, are not infallible\u2014if they were, the condition would\nnot be independent from truth\u2014so we can imagine a case in which\nthey go wrong. Perhaps this is an unusual instance in which\nMary\u2019s husband\u2019s brother, who looks a lot like the\nhusband, is in the living room, and Mary concludes, on the basis of\nthe proper function of her visual capacity, that her husband is in the\nliving room. This belief, since false, is certainly not knowledge.\n\nIn step two, we imagine Mary\u2019s misidentification of the occupant\nof the living room as before, but add to the case that the husband is,\nby luck, also in the living room. Now Mary\u2019s belief is true, but\nintuitively, it is no more an instance of knowledge than the false\nbelief in the first step was.\n\nSince the recipe is a general one, it appears to be applicable to any\ncondition one might add to the JTB theory, so long as it does not\nitself entail truth. The argument generalizes against all\n\u201cnon-redundant\u201d JTB+X analyses.\n\nOne potential response to Zagzebski\u2019s argument, and the failure\nof the Gettier project more generally, would be to conclude that\nknowledge is unanalyzable. Although it would represent a significant\ndeparture from much analytic epistemology of the late twentieth\ncentury, it is not clear that this is ultimately a particularly\nradical suggestion. Few concepts of interest have proved susceptible\nto traditional analysis (Fodor 1998). One prominent approach to\nknowledge in this vein is discussed in\n \u00a711\n below.\n\nAnother possible line is the one mentioned in\n \u00a72\u2014to\n strengthen the justification condition to rule out Gettier cases as\njustified. In order for this strategy to prevent Zagzebski\u2019s\nrecipe from working, one would need to posit a justification condition\nthat precludes the possibility of step one above\u2014the only\nobvious way to do this is for justification to entail truth. If it\ndoes, then it will of course be impossible to start with a case that\nhas justified false belief. This kind of approach is not at all mainstream, but it does\nhave its defenders\u2014see e.g., Sturgeon\n1993 and Merricks\n1995. Sutton 2007 and Littlejohn 2012 defend factive approaches to\njustification on other grounds.\n\nA third avenue of response would be to consider potential analyses of\nknowledge that are not of the nonredundant form JTB+X. Indeed,\nwe have already seen some such attempts, albeit unsuccessful ones. For\ninstance, the causal theory of knowledge includes a clause requiring\nthat the belief that p be caused by the fact that p.\nThis condition entails both belief and truth, and so is not\nsusceptible to Zagzebski\u2019s recipe. (As we\u2019ve seen, it\nfalls to Gettier-style cases on other grounds.) One family of\nstrategies along these lines would build into an analysis of knowledge\na prohibition on epistemic luck directly; let us consider this sort of\nmove in more detail.\n8. Epistemic Luck\n\nIf the problem illustrated by Gettier cases is that JTB and JTB+\nanalyses are compatible with a degree of epistemic luck that is\ninconsistent with knowledge, a natural idea is to amend one\u2019s\nanalysis of knowledge by including an explicit \u201canti-luck\u201d\ncondition. Zagzebski herself outlines this option in her 1994 (p. 72).\nUnger 1968 gives an early analysis of this kind. For example:\n\n\nS knows that p iff\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS is justified in believing that p.\nS\u2019s belief is not true merely by luck.\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note about this analysis is that it is\n\u201credundant\u201d in the sense described in the previous\nsection; the fourth condition entails the first\n two.[29]\n So its surface form notwithstanding, it actually represents a\nsignificant departure from the JTB+ analyses. Rather than composing\nknowledge from various independent components, this analysis demands\ninstead that the epistemic states are related to one another in\nsubstantive ways.\n\nThe anti-luck condition, like the safety condition of the previous\nsection, is vague as stated. For one thing, whether a belief is true\nby luck comes in degrees\u2014just how much luck does it take to be\ninconsistent with knowledge? Furthermore, it seems, independently of\nquestions about degrees of luck, we must distinguish between different\nkinds of luck. Not all epistemic luck is incompatible with\nhaving knowledge. Suppose someone enters a raffle and wins an\nencyclopedia, then reads various of its entries, correcting many of\ntheir previous misapprehensions. There is a straightforward sense in\nwhich the resultant beliefs are true only by luck\u2014for our\nsubject was very lucky to have won that raffle\u2014but this is not\nthe sort of luck, intuitively, that interferes with the possession of\n knowledge.[30]\n Furthermore, there is a sense in which our ordinary perceptual beliefs\nare true by luck, since it is possible for us to have been the victim of a\nCartesian demon and so we are, in some sense, lucky not to be. But\nunless we are to capitulate to radical skepticism, it seems that this\nsort of luck, too, ought to be considered compatible with\n knowledge.[31]\n\nLike the safety condition, then, a luck condition ends up being\ndifficult to apply in some cases. We might try to clarify the luck\ncondition as involving a distinctive notion of epistemic\nluck\u2014but unless we were able to explicate that notion\u2014in\neffect, to distinguish between the two kinds of luck mentioned\nabove\u2014without recourse to knowledge, it is not clear that the\nensuing analysis of knowledge could be both informative and\nnoncircular.\n9. Methodological Options\n\nAs our discussion so far makes clear, one standard way of evaluating\nattempted analyses of knowledge has given a central role to testing it\nagainst intuitions against cases. In the late twentieth century, the\nperceived lack of progress towards an acceptable\nanalysis\u2014including the considerations attributed to Zagzebski in\n\u00a77 above\u2014led some epistemologists to pursue other\nmethodological strategies. (No doubt, a wider philosophical trend away\nfrom \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d more broadly also contributed\nto this change.) Some of the more recent attempts to analyse knowledge\nhave been motivated in part by broader considerations about the role\nof knowledge, or of discourse about knowledge.\n\nOne important view of this sort is that defended by Edward Craig\n(1990). Craig\u2019s entry-point into the analysis of knowledge was\nnot intuitions about cases, but rather a focus on the role that the\nconcept of knowledge plays for humans. In particular, Craig suggested\nthat the point of using the category of knowledge was for people to\nflag reliable informants\u2014to help people know whom to trust in\nmatters epistemic. Craig defends an account of knowledge that is\ndesigned to fill this role, even though it is susceptible to intuitive\ncounterexamples. The plausibility of such accounts, with a less\nintuitive extension but with a different kind of theoretical\njustification, is a matter of controversy.\n\nAnother view worth mentioning in this context is that of Hilary\nKornblith (2002), which has it that knowledge is a natural kind, to be\nanalysed the same way other scientific kinds are. Intuition has a role\nto play in identifying paradigms, but generalizing from there is an\nempirical, scientific matter, and intuitive counterexamples are to be\nexpected.\n\nThe \u201cknowledge first\u201d stance is also connected to these\nmethodological issues. See \u00a711 below.\n10. Virtue-Theoretic Approaches\n\nThe virtue-theoretic approach to knowledge is in some respects similar\nto the safety and anti-luck approaches. Indeed, Ernest Sosa, one of\nthe most prominent authors of the virtue-theoretic approach, developed\nit from his previous work on safety. The virtue approach treats\nknowledge as a particularly successful or valuable form of belief, and\nexplicates what it is to be knowledge in such terms. Like the\nanti-luck theory, a virtue-theoretic theory leaves behind the JTB+\nproject of identifying knowledge with a truth-functional combination\nof independent epistemic properties; knowledge, according to this\napproach, requires a certain non-logical relationship between belief\nand truth.\n10.1 The \u201cAAA\u201d Evaluations\n\nSosa has often (e.g., Sosa 2007: ch. 2) made use of an analogy of a\nskilled archer shooting at a target; we may find it instructive as\nwell. Here are two ways in which an archer\u2019s shot might be\nevaluated:\n\nWas the shot successful? Did it hit its target?\nDid the shot\u2019s execution manifest the\narcher\u2019s skill? Was it produced in a way that makes it likely to\nsucceed?\n\n\nThe kind of success at issue in (1), Sosa calls accuracy. The\nkind of skill discussed in (2), Sosa calls adroitness. A shot\nis adroit if it is produced skillfully. Adroit shots needn\u2019t be\naccurate, as not all skilled shots succeed. And accurate shots\nneedn\u2019t be adroit, as some unskilled shots are lucky.\n\nIn addition to accuracy and adroitness, Sosa suggests that there is\nanother respect in which a shot may be evaluated, relating the two.\nThis, Sosa calls aptness.\n\nDid the shot\u2019s success manifest the archer\u2019s\nskill?\n\n\nA shot is apt if it is accurate because adroit. Aptness\nentails, but requires more than, the conjunction of accuracy and\nadroitness, for a shot might be both successful and skillful without\nbeing apt. For example, if a skillful shot is diverted by an\nunexpected gust of wind, then redirected towards the target by a\nsecond lucky gust, its ultimate accuracy does not manifest the skill,\nbut rather reflects the lucky coincidence of the wind.\n\nSosa suggests that this \u201cAAA\u201d model of evaluation is\napplicable quite generally for the evaluation of any action or object\nwith a characteristic aim. In particular, it is applicable to belief\nwith respect to its aim at truth:\n\nA belief is accurate if and only if it is true.\nA belief is adroit if and only if it is produced\n skillfully.[32]\nA belief is apt if and only if it is true in a way\nmanifesting, or attributable to, the believer\u2019s skill.\n\n\nSosa identifies knowledge with apt belief, so\n understood.[33]\n Knowledge entails both truth (accuracy) and justification\n(adroitness), on this view, but they are not merely independent\ncomponents out of which knowledge is truth-functionally composed. It\nrequires that the skill explain the success. This is in some respects\nsimilar to the anti-luck condition we have examined above, in that it\nlegislates that the relation between justification and truth be no\nmere coincidence. However, insofar as Sosa\u2019s \u201cAAA\u201d\nmodel is generally applicable in a way going beyond epistemology,\nthere are perhaps better prospects for understanding the relevant\nnotion of aptness in a way independent of understanding knowledge\nitself than we found for the notion of epistemic luck.\n10.2 Fake Barn Cases\n\nUnderstanding knowledge as apt belief accommodates Gettier\u2019s\ntraditional counterexamples to the JTB theory rather\nstraightforwardly. When Smith believes that either Jones owns a Ford\nor Brown is in Barcelona, the accuracy of his belief is not\nattributable to his inferential skills (which the case does not call\ninto question). Rather, unlucky circumstances (the misleading evidence\nabout Jones\u2019s car) have interfered with his skillful cognitive\nperformance, just as the first diverting gust of wind interfered with\nthe archer\u2019s shot. Compensating for the unlucky interference, a\nlucky circumstance (Brown\u2019s coincidental presence in Barcelona)\nrenders the belief true after all, similar to the way in which the\nsecond gust of wind returns the archer\u2019s arrow back onto the\nproper path towards the target.\n\nFake barn cases, by contrast, may be less easily accommodated by\nSosa\u2019s AAA approach. When Henry looks at the only real barn in a\ncountryside full of barn facades, he uses a generally reliable\nperceptual faculty for recognizing barns, and he goes right in this\ninstance. Suppose we say the accuracy of Henry\u2019s belief\nmanifests his competence as a perceiver. If so, we would have to judge\nthat his belief is apt and therefore qualifies as an instance of\nknowledge. That would be a problematic outcome because the intuition\nthe case is meant to elicit is that Henry does not have\nknowledge. There are three ways in which an advocate of the AAA\napproach might respond to this difficulty.\n\nFirst, AAA advocates might argue that, although Henry has a general\ncompetence to recognize barns, he is deprived of this ability in his\ncurrent environment, precisely because he is in fake barn county.\nAccording to a second, subtly different strategy, Henry retains\nbarn-recognition competence, his current location notwithstanding,\nbut, due to the ubiquity of fake barns, his competence does not\nmanifest itself in his belief, since its truth is attributable more to\nluck than to his skill in recognizing\n barns.[34]\n Third, Sosa\u2019s own response to the problem is to bite the\nbullet. Judging Henry\u2019s belief to be apt, Sosa accepts the\noutcome that Henry knows there is a barn before him. He attempts to\nexplain away the counterintuitiveness of this result by emphasizing\nthe lack of a further epistemically valuable state, which he calls\n\u201creflective knowledge\u201d (see Sosa 2007: 31\u201332).\n11. Knowledge First\n\nNot every concept is analyzable into more fundamental terms. This is\nclear both upon reflection on examples\u2014what analysis could be\noffered of hydrogen, animal, or John F.\nKennedy?\u2014and on grounds of infinite regress. Why should we\nthink that knowledge has an analysis? In recent work,\nespecially his 2000 book Knowledge and Its Limits, Timothy\nWilliamson has argued that the project of analyzing knowledge was a\nmistake. His reason is not that he thinks that knowledge is an\nuninteresting state, or that the notion of knowledge is somehow\nfundamentally confused. On the contrary, Williamson thinks that\nknowledge is among the most fundamental psychological and\nepistemological states there are. As such, it is a mistake to analyze\nknowledge in terms of other, more fundamental epistemic notions,\nbecause knowledge itself is, in at least many cases, more fundamental.\nAs Williamson puts it, we should put \u201cknowledge first\u201d.\nKnowledge might figure into some analyses, but it will do so in the\nanalysans, not in the\n analysandum.[35]\n\nThere is no very straightforward argument for this conclusion; its\ncase consists largely in the attempted demonstration of the\ntheoretical success of the knowledge first stance. Weighing these\nbenefits against those of more traditional approaches to knowledge is\nbeyond the scope of this\n article.[36]\n\nAlthough Williamson denies that knowledge is susceptible to analysis\nin the sense at issue in this article, he does think that there are\ninteresting and informative ways to characterize knowledge. For\nexample, Williamson accepts these claims:\n\nKnowledge is the most general factive mental state.\nS knows that p if and only if S\u2019s total\nevidence includes the proposition that p.\n\n\nWilliamson is also careful to emphasize that the rejection of the\nproject of analyzing knowledge in no way suggests that there are not\ninteresting and informative necessary or sufficient conditions on\nknowledge. The traditional ideas that knowledge entails truth, belief,\nand justification are all consistent with the knowledge first project.\nAnd Williamson (2000: 126) is explicit in endorsement of a safety\nrequirement on knowledge\u2014just not one that serves as part of an\nanalysis.\n\nOne point worth recognizing, then, is that one need not engage in the\nambitious project of attempting to analyze knowledge in order to have\ncontact with a number of interesting questions about which factors are\nand are not relevant for whether a subject has knowledge. In the next\nsection, we consider an important contemporary debate about whether\npragmatic factors are relevant for knowledge.\n12. Pragmatic Encroachment\n\nTraditional approaches to knowledge have it that knowledge has to do\nwith factors like truth and justification. Whether knowledge requires\nsafety, sensitivity, reliability, or independence from certain kinds\nof luck has proven controversial. But something that all of these\npotential conditions on knowledge seem to have in common is that they\nhave some sort of intimate connection with the truth of the relevant\nbelief. Although it is admittedly difficult to make the relevant\nconnection precise, there is an intuitive sense in which every factor\nwe\u2019ve examined as a candidate for being relevant to knowledge\nhas something to do with truth of the would-be knowledgeable\nbeliefs.\n\nIn recent years, some epistemologists have argued that focus on such\ntruth-relevant factors leaves something important out of our picture\nof knowledge. In particular, they have argued that distinctively\npragmatic factors are relevant to whether a subject has\nknowledge. Call this thesis \u201cpragmatic\n encroachment\u201d:[37]\n\n\nPragmatic Encroachment:\n\nA difference in pragmatic circumstances can constitute a difference in\nknowledge.\n\n\nThe constitution claim here is important; it is trivial that\ndifferences in pragmatic circumstances can cause differences\nin knowledge. For example, if the question of whether marijuana use is\nlegal in Connecticut is more important to Sandra than it is to Daniel,\nSandra is more likely to seek out evidence, and come to knowledge,\nthan Daniel is. This uninteresting claim is not what is at issue.\nPragmatic encroachment theorists think that the practical importance\nitself can make for a change in knowledge, without reliance on such\ndownstream effects as a difference in evidence-gathering activity.\nSandra and Daniel might in some sense be in the same epistemic\nposition, where the only difference is that the question is more\nimportant to Sandra. This difference, according to pragmatic\nencroachment, might make it the case that Daniel knows, but Sandra\ndoes\n not.[38]\n\nPragmatic encroachment can be motivated by intuitions about cases.\nJason Stanley\u2019s 2005 book Knowledge and Practical\nInterests argues that it is the best explanation for pairs of\ncases like the following, where the contrasted cases are evidentially\nalike, but differ pragmatically:\n\n\nLow Stakes. Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving\nhome on a Friday afternoon. They plan to stop at the bank on the way\nhome to deposit their paychecks. It is not important that they do so,\nas they have no impending bills. But as they drive past the bank, they\nnotice that the lines inside are very long, as they often are on\nFriday afternoons. Realizing that it wasn\u2019t very important that\ntheir paychecks are deposited right away, Hannah says, \u201cI know\nthe bank will be open tomorrow, since I was there just two weeks ago\non Saturday morning. So we can deposit our paychecks tomorrow\nmorning\u201d.\n\nHigh Stakes. Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving\nhome on a Friday afternoon. They plan to stop at the bank on the way\nhome to deposit their paychecks. Since they have an impending bill\ncoming due, and very little in their account, it is very important\nthat they deposit their paychecks by Saturday. Hannah notes that she\nwas at the bank two weeks before on a Saturday morning, and it was\nopen. But, as Sarah points out, banks do change their hours. Hannah\nsays, \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know that the\nbank will be open tomorrow\u201d. (Stanley 2005: 3\u20134)\n\n\nStanley argues that the moral of cases like these is that in general,\nthe more important the question of whether p, the harder it is\nto know that p. Other, more broadly theoretical, arguments for\npragmatic encroachment have been offered as well. Fantl & McGrath\n(2009) argue that encroachment follows from fallibilism and plausible\nprinciples linking knowledge and action, while Weatherson 2012 argues\nthat the best interpretation of decision theory requires\nencroachment.\n\nPragmatic encroachment is not an analysis of knowledge; it is merely\nthe claim that pragmatic factors are relevant for determining whether\na subject\u2019s belief constitutes knowledge. Some, but not all,\npragmatic encroachment theorists will endorse a necessary\nbiconditional that might be interpreted as an analysis of knowledge.\nFor example, a pragmatic encroachment theorist might claim that:\n\n\nS knows that p if and only if no epistemic weakness\nvis-\u00e1-vis p prevents S from properly using\np as a reason for action.\n\n\nThis connection between knowledge and action is similar to ones\nendorsed by Fantl & McGrath (2009), but it is stronger than\nanything they argue for.\n\nPragmatic encroachment on knowledge is deeply controversial. Patrick\nRysiew (2001), Jessica Brown (2006), and Mikkel Gerken (forthcoming) have\nargued that traditional views about the nature of knowledge are\nsufficient to account for the data mentioned above. Michael\nBlome-Tillmann (2009a) argues that it has unacceptably\ncounterintuitive results, like the truth of such claims as\nS knows that p, but if it were more important, she\nwouldn\u2019t know, or S knew that p until the\nquestion became important. Stanley (2005) offers strategies for\naccepting such consequences. Other, more theoretical arguments against\nencroachment have also been advanced; see for example Ichikawa,\nJarvis, and Rubin (2012), who argue that pragmatic encroachment is at\nodds with important tenets of belief-desire psychology.\n13. Contextualism\n\nOne final topic standing in need of treatment is contextualism about\nknowledge attributions, according to which the word\n\u201cknows\u201d and its cognates are context-sensitive. The\nrelationship between contextualism and the analysis of knowledge is\nnot at all straightforward. Arguably, they have different subject\nmatters (the former a word, and the latter a mental state).\nNevertheless, the methodology of theorizing about knowledge may be\nhelpfully informed by semantic considerations about the language in\nwhich such theorizing takes place. And if contextualism is correct,\nthen a theorist of knowledge must attend carefully to the potential\nfor ambiguity.\n\nIt is uncontroversial that many English words are context-sensitive.\nThe most obvious cases are indexicals, such as \u201cI\u201d,\n\u201cyou\u201d, \u201chere\u201d, and \u201cnow\u201d (David\nKaplan 1977 gives the standard view of indexicals).\n\nThe word \u201cyou\u201d refers to a different person, depending on\nthe conversational context in which it is uttered; in particular, it\ndepends on the person one is addressing. Other context-sensitive terms\nare gradable adjectives like \u201ctall\u201d\u2014how tall\nsomething must be to count as \u201ctall\u201d depends on the\nconversational context\u2014and quantifiers like\n\u201ceveryone\u201d\u2014which people count as part of\n\u201ceveryone\u201d depends on the conversational context.\nContextualists about \u201cknows\u201d think that this verb belongs\non the list of context-sensitive terms. A consequence of contextualism\nis that sentences containing \u201cknows\u201d may express distinct\npropositions, depending on the conversational contexts in which\nthey\u2019re uttered. This feature allows contextualists to offer an\neffective, though not uncontroversial, response to skepticism. For a\nmore thorough overview of contextualism and its bearing on skepticism,\nsee Rysiew 2011 or Ichikawa forthcoming-b.\n\nContextualists have modeled this context-sensitivity in various ways.\nKeith DeRose 2009 has suggested that there is a context-invariant\nnotion of \u201cstrength of epistemic position\u201d, and that how\nstrong a position one must be in in order to satisfy\n\u201cknows\u201d varies from context to context; this is in effect\nto understand the semantics of knowledge attributions much as we\nunderstand that of gradable adjectives. (How much height one must have\nto satisfy \u201ctall\u201d also varies from context to context.)\nCohen 1988 adopts a contextualist treatment of \u201crelevant\nalternatives\u201d theory, according to which, in skeptical contexts,\nbut not ordinary ones, skeptical possibilities are relevant. This\naspect is retained in the view of Lewis 1996, which characterizes a\ncontextualist approach that is more similar to quantifiers and modals.\nBlome-Tillmann 2009b and\nIchikawa forthcoming-a defend and\ndevelop the Lewisian view in different ways.\n\nContextualism and pragmatic encroachment represent different\nstrategies for addressing some of the same \u201cshifty\u201d\npatterns of intuitive data. (In fact, contextualism was generally\ndeveloped first; pragmatic encroachment theorists were motivated in\npart by the attempt to explain some of the patterns contextualists\nwere interested in without contextualism\u2019s semantic\ncommitments.) Although this represents a sense in which they tend to\nbe rival approaches, contextualism and pragmatic encroachment are by\nno means inconsistent. One could think that \u201cknows\u201d\nrequires the satisfaction of different standards in different\ncontexts, and also think that the subject\u2019s practical\nsituation is relevant for whether a given standard is satisfied.\n\nLike pragmatic encroachment, contextualism is deeply controversial.\nCritics have argued that it posits an implausible kind of semantic\nerror in ordinary speakers who do not recognize the putative\ncontext-sensitivity\u2014see Schiffer 1996 and Greenough &\nKindermann forthcoming\u2014and that it is at odds with plausible\ntheoretical principles involving knowledge\u2014see Hawthorne 2003,\nWilliamson 2005, and Worsnip forthcoming. In addition, some of the arguments\nthat are used to undercut the data motivating pragmatic encroachment\nare also taken to undermine the case for contextualism; see again\nRysiew 2001 and Brown 2006. \n",
