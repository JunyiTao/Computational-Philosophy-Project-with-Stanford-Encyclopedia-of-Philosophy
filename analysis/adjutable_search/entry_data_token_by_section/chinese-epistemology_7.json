    "main_text": "Classical Approaches || Language and Comprehension\n3.1 Language and Comprehension\n\nThese debates were determined by the conflict between classical\nConfucianism and orthodox Mohism, with the representatives of the\nformer advocating traditionalist positions, while the latter argued\nfor more utilitarian approaches (Hansen 1989: 108). In contrast to the\nclassical Confucian position which had been formulated in the\nDiscourse on proper names (see\n section 1.2)\n and follows the presumption that names imply the essence of\nrealities, this utilitarian position derived from their awareness of\nthe relativity of comprehension. Just as we can never know whether the\nthings we perceive are identical to reality, we can also never be\ncertain whether the meanings we express are actually understood in the\nsame way as they were intended (see Mozi CTP: Jing\nxia,110).\n\nThe reaction to these traditionalistic and utilitarian positions\nwithin ancient Chinese epistemology expressed itself in two different\nepistemological viewpoints that can both be designated as\n\u201cuniformist\u201d. The foundations of the first approach were\nestablished by the Confucian Xunzi (ca 230\u2013310 BC) while the\ncentral premises of the second were founded by his disciple and\nfounder of the Legalist school (Fa jia \u6cd5\u5bb6) Han\nFei (280\u2013233 BC).\n\nXunzi did not advocate the positions of pure traditionalism. And while\nhe saw his epistemology as an elaboration of the traditional Confucian\nteachings, it can in qualitative terms be considered as a new reaction\nto traditional approaches. In this respect, Xunzi can be placed among\nthe precursors of the new epistemology, which advocated universalistic\npositions. However, Xunzi\u2019s own teachings were based upon\nrelativistic approaches. Because language depended on social\nconventions, he knew how difficult it was to choose criteria for\nselecting names. However, despite these views, he sharply condemned\nthe Mohist reformism, arguing that the Confucian system of\nstandardization was still the best possible way to ensure a\nwell-regulated and harmonious society. Contrary to the Confucian\nAnalects, he did not believe in the primary mission of some\nideal language which incorporated the essence of existing realities,\nbut considered names and linguistic concepts as merely arbitrary means\nfor expressing concrete (objective) social realities. Despite this\nfundamental difference, for purely pragmatic reasons he continued to\nadvocate the Confucian Discourse on proper names, for he was\nconvinced that names (ming) also transmitted values, thus\nserving the social order, and therefore had to be adequately\nstandardized (Xunzi CTP: Zheng ming, 4). He also argued that\nthe classification and categorization of names were not necessarily as\ndifficult as it first appeared, for the human senses perceived\ndifferent realities in a structurally similar way; this\nphysiologically conditioned similarity therefore provided a basis for\nthe formation of common linguistic conventions (Xunzi CTP: Zheng\nming, 5). These standardized agreements made a functioning social\ncoordination\u2014including the connection between human acts and\nmoral postulates\u2014possible. Names therefore had to be regulated\nin such a way that they could serve the elite as a formal tool for\nrestoring and preserving their political power: It was precisely these\narguments which, in the works of his followers, would come to form the\nbasis for the legalistic epistemology that shaped the doctrine of one\nof the most totalitarian governments in Chinese history.\n\nXunzi\u2019s disciple Han Fei developed a philosophy that combined\nthe basic concepts of the traditionalistic and utilitarian approaches.\nHis epistemology, which was based upon the concepts of authority\n(wei \u5a01) and advantage (li \u5229),\nrepresented a unified system founded on the idea of political\nabsolutism (see Han CTP: Gui Shi, 1).\n",
