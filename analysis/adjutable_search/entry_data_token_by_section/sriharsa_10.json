    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Distinctness\n3.2 Distinctness\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s discussion of\ndistinctness\u2014the property in virtue of which an object\nis recognized as distinct from another\u2014is deeply connected with\nhis commitment to a form of non-dualism. In the first chapter of\nThe Sweets of Refutation, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a raises the\nquestion of how one knows that the self alone is ultimately real. The\nanswer is simple: the Upani\u1e63ads\u2014insofar as they literally\nproclaim that there is no plurality of objects in the\nworld\u2014provide evidence for this claim. But this answer runs into\ntrouble pretty quickly: the Upani\u1e63ads cannot be trusted with\nregard to their literal content, since that content is contradicted by\nthe deliverances of perception. The world, as we see it, is populated\nby a plurality of objects (KKh 74). It is this objection that\nmotivates \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a to argue against the ultimate\nreality of distinctness of\n objects.[22]\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a offers several arguments against\ndistinctness, the first and the most important of which appears in the\nfirst chapter of the Sweets of Refutation (for a more\nelaborate treatment discussion, see Phillips 1995: 103\u2013110).\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a claims that distinctness of one object from\nanother must either be (a) the very nature of the object\n(svar\u016bpa), (b) mutual absence\n(anyony\u0101bh\u0101va), (c) difference in properties\n(vaidharmya), and (d) something else, like separateness\n(p\u1e5bthaktva). Proposals (a), (b) and (c) are accepted by\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers such as Udayana\n(\u015a\u0101str\u012b 1940: 255), and (d) is accepted by\nBh\u0101sarvaj\u00f1a (Yog\u012bndr\u0101nanda 1968: 160) and Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas (Kunhan Raja & Sastri 1933: 242).\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s contention is this: Irrespective of\nhow we define distinctness, no awareness\u2014perceptual or\notherwise\u2014can present one object as distinct from another,\nwithout also presenting them as non-distinct (KKh 96\u2013110). This,\nin turn, shows that even perceptual awareness of distinctness cannot\ncontradict the Upanisadic testimony about non-distinctness of all\nobjects.\n\nConsider, for instance, proposal (a): namely, the distinctness of an\nentity x from an entity y is just the nature of\nx. Now, note that the distinctness of an entity x from\nan entity y is a relational property of x,\ni.e., x has that property only in virtue of being related in\nsome way to y. But this relational property is constituted by\ny. So, if this relational property is the very nature of\nx, then y constitutes the very nature of x. By\nsimilar reasoning, if y is distinct from x, and this\ndistinctness is a relational property of y, then x\nconstitutes the very nature of y. For any two entities x\nand y, if x constitutes the very nature of y and\ny constitutes the very nature of x, then they are\nidentical. Thus, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a arrives at his desired\nconclusion: a perceptual awareness of the difference of a cloth from a\npot, would also reveal that the pot and the cloth are in fact\nidentical.\n\nNow, take proposal (b): namely, that distinctness consists in mutual\nexclusion. In treating distinctness as mutual exclusion,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s opponent essentially has said that to\nascribe to an entity x the distinctness from y is to\nascribe to x an absence of the property of being identical to\ny. But this raises a problem for his\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika opponent: by the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher\u2019s own doctrine, the\ncounter-positive (pratiyogin) of an\nabsence\u2014the entity that an absence is an absence\nof\u2014must be ultimately real. For instance, according to the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher, it makes no sense to say\nthat there is an absence of turtle-fur on the ground (since turtles\ndon\u2019t really have fur), but it does make sense to say that a\nturtle doesn\u2019t have fur (since fur in fact does exist). So, if a\ncloth is to be characterized by the absence of the property of being\nidentical to a pot, the cloth\u2019s identity with the pot must be\nultimately real. Once again, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a gets what he\nwanted: a perceptual awareness of the distinctness of a cloth from a\npot would also reveal the identity between the pot and the cloth.\n\nA similar result can be obtained for proposal (c) by means of a\nregress argument. According to proposal (c), distinctness consists in\na difference in properties. If the distinctness of the pot from the\ncloth is a matter of their having different sets of properties, then\nwe must ask what it is in virtue of which the relevant properties are\nrecognized as distinct. If it\u2019s because the properties have\ndifferent sets of higher-order properties, then we will be launched on\na regress; for we can raise the same question with respect to these\nproperties. In order to stop the regress, if we say that some of the\ndistinguishing higher-order properties needn\u2019t themselves have\ndistinguishing higher-order properties, then we would end up with the\nresult that the entities lower down in the hierarchy cannot be really\nbe recognized as distinct. So, the pot and the cloth will be presented\nin awareness as non-distinct or identical.\n\nThe same line of reasoning will also apply to proposal (d), which\nclaims that distinctness is a matter of possessing a property like\nseparateness. If the pot is distinct from the cloth in virtue of\npossessing the property of cloth-separateness, and the cloth is\ndistinct from the pot in virtue of possessing the property of\npot-separateness, then we may ask what is it in virtue of which\npot-separateness and cloth-separateness are distinct properties. This\nwill launch us on a regress. In order to block it, we would have to\naccept that the relevant separateness-properties are not really\ndistinct; so, the cloth and the pot will turn out to be identical.\nThat\u2019s exactly what \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a wants.\n",
