Vagueness\n\n(The so-called \u2018argument from vagueness\u2019, sometimes\ninvoked in support of temporal parts, is discussed in\n Section 8\n below.)\n\nVagueness, or indeterminacy, seems to be a feature of our everyday\nexperience of persisting things, and it creates problems which,\naccording to temporal parts theorists, can best be solved by accepting\nthat things have temporal parts. As with the problems of change and of\ncoincidence, endurantists may criticise the temporal parts solution to\nthis problem, provide solutions of their own, or both.\n\nVagueness often occurs at the beginning and ending of existence. It is\nnotoriously controversial whether there is a precise moment at which\nhuman people begin to exist, and if so when that moment is. But most\nof us will have a grey area at the end of our existence, a few\nseconds, a few minutes, or even longer during which we seem to be\nneither clearly alive nor clearly dead. More mundanely, formation and\ndecay are gradual processes for many kinds of object, both natural and\nartificial: think of a lake or haystack which gradually comes into\nexistence, or a building or a rock formation which slowly crumbles\naway. Let\u2019s call this phenomenon \u2018fuzzy temporal\nboundaries\u2019.\n\nIndeterminacy can also arise when objects intermingle in a way which\nseems to leave it clear that they survive the process, but unclear\nwhich object is which. Suppose you remove about half the parts from\nthe bicycle your uncle gave you, about half the parts from the bicycle\nyour aunt gave you, and switch them over. Afterwards, you have two\nbicycles, each half-made of parts that used to be in the bicycle your\nuncle gave you, and half-made of parts that used to be in the bicycle\nyour aunt gave you. Which post-repair bicycle is the one your uncle\ngave you, and which the one your aunt gave you? There seems to be no\nclear fact of the matter. Let\u2019s call this phenomenon\n\u2018radical disruption\u2019.\n\nIn their bare essentials, the two types of indeterminacy are the same\n(and it is possible to construct cases of intermediate types). In each\ncase, we are not sure how to pin down the career of an object. In\nfuzzy-boundary cases, we don\u2019t know which of many overlapping\ncareer paths an object follows (one which begins earlier, or later?);\nin radical disruption cases, we don\u2019t know which of (at least)\ntwo intersecting career paths an object follows.\n\nTypical temporal parts theorists argue that such indeterminacy results\nfrom a mismatch between human language and temporarily-coincident\nobjects (of the sort discussed in\n section 4.1).\n Take a building which slowly crumbles away to nothing. According to\nmost temporal parts theorists, there are very many\n\u2018nested\u2019 four-dimensional objects involved in this\nprocess, some of which end before others do. We are unclear about when\nthe building ceases to exist because our use of language just\ndoesn\u2019t determine which of these many four-dimensional objects\nis \u2018the building\u2019.\n\nLikewise, in radical disruption cases like that of the bicycles,\nperdurantists typically recognise a number of different\ntemporarily-coincident four-dimensional objects. Suppose the bicycle\nyour uncle gave you starts off made of parts A and parts\nB, and the bicycle your aunt gave you starts off made of parts\nC and parts D. After the switch-around, you have a\nbicycle made of parts A and parts C, and a bicycle made\nof parts B and parts D. Perdurantists recognise (at\nleast) the following four-dimensional objects:\n\nsomething that begins with A and B, then continues\nwith A and C;\nsomething that begins with A and B, then continues\nwith B and D;\nsomething that begins with C and D, then continues\nwith A and C;\nsomething that begins with C and D, then continues\nwith B and D.\n\n\nBefore the switch-around, objects (1) and (2) temporarily coincide, in\nthe place where you keep the bicycle your uncle gave you, and objects\n(3) and (4) temporarily coincide, in the place where you keep the\nbicycle your aunt gave you. After the switch-around, objects (1) and\n(3) coincide, and objects (2) and (4) coincide. When we initially\ntalked about \u2018the bicycle your uncle gave you\u2019, there was\nno fact of the matter as to whether we were talking about (1) or (2).\nAnd (1) and (2) end up in different places after the switch-around,\nwhich is why we don\u2019t know what to say about the final location\nof the bicycle your uncle gave you.\n\nFrom a typical perdurantist perspective, apparent indeterminacy in\npersistence arises from our fumbling failures to deal with the\nmultitude of precise four-dimensional objects around us. This account\nof indeterminacy is not a consequence of perdurance theory alone: as\nwell as the claim that ordinary things have temporal parts, it\ninvolves the claim that there are many more persisting things than we\nrecognise in ordinary life. It is possible to believe in temporal\nparts without accepting this second claim but, as we will see in\n section 8,\n most perdurantists do accept the second claim. The typical\nperdurantist story also involves a theory of vagueness which traces it\nto our use of language; it is not compulsory for perdurantists to\nthink about vagueness in this way, but many do adopt this\n\u2018linguistic\u2019 or \u2018semantic\u2019 approach to\nvagueness.\n\nObjections to the typical temporal parts account of indeterminacy in\npersistence turn on the sheer number of temporarily coincident objects\nrequired to make the story work; or on independent objections to the\nlanguage-based account of vagueness (see the separate entry on\n vagueness);\n or on particular objections to telling such a story about\nindeterminacy involving people (see\n section 9).\n\nWhat can endurantists say about indeterminacy in persistence?\u00a0\nOne option is to mimic the perdurantist temporary-coincidence account,\nbut without the temporal parts. That\u2019s to say, endurantists\ncould claim that there are very many wholly-present coincident\nbuilding-like objects where the building stands, each of which ends at\na slightly different moment from all the others. This multiplicity,\ntogether with our loose talk, accounts for the unclarity in when the\nbuilding ceases to exist. Likewise, endurantists could recognise\nobjects (1)\u2013(4), just as perdurantists do, but claim that each\nis wholly present whenever it exists. This strategy is unpopular,\nbecause temporarily-coincident enduring objects can seem worse than\ntemporarily-coincident perduring objects: temporarily-coincident\nendurers are wholly coincident, unlike temporarily-coincident\nperdurers. Endurantists may want to recognise some temporarily\ncoinciding things (see\n section 4.1),\n yet stop short of the multitudes which would be required to explain\nfuzzy boundaries.\n\nA second endurantist option is to accept that sometimes there just are\nno precise facts of the matter about the temporal boundaries and\ncareers of objects, because the world itself is sometimes\nindeterminate. This is the claim that there can be worldly\n(\u2018ontic\u2019, or \u2018metaphysical\u2019) vagueness. (A\nworldly-vagueness option is also available to perdurantists, and might\nbe attractive to those who want to avoid commitment to a multitude of\ntemporarily-coincident four-dimensional objects. But typical\nperdurantists adopt the\ntemporary-coincidence-plus-linguistic-vagueness account outlined\nabove.)\n\nMany people recoil at the thought that the world itself could be vague\nor indeterminate, perhaps because they believe that indeterminacy must\nbe a result of mismatch between what is represented (the world), and\nwhat does the representing (thought or language). Even those who\ndon\u2019t mind a bit of worldly vagueness may have reason to reject\nworldly vagueness in persistence, because this amounts to worldly\nvagueness in identity: it\u2019s vague whether the original bicycle\nyour uncle gave you is identical with the bicycle you now ride to\nwork. Worldly vagueness in identity is thought to be especially\nproblematic, because all identity is self-identity, and it\u2019s\nhard to see how there could be any vagueness in self-identity.\n\nThird, endurantists could claim that we speak precisely, that there\nalways are determinate facts of the matter about the identity,\nexistence and careers of objects, but it\u2019s just that sometimes\nwe can\u2019t tell what these facts are. (This involves an\n\u2018epistemicist\u2019 account of vagueness.) This claim could be\ndeveloped in one of two ways. In the case of the crumbling building,\nfor example, endurantists could claim that there is a single\nbuilding-shaped object with an unknown final moment. Or they could\nclaim that there are very many temporarily-coincident building-like\nobjects, each with a different final moment, that we refer to just one\nof these when we say \u2018the building\u2019 but we do not know\nwhich. (Again, perdurantists may adopt one of these epistemicist\nstrategies, but typically do not.)\n\nObjections here may turn on problems for the epistemicist view of\nvagueness in general; on the oddity of insisting that, for example,\nthere is an exact number of molecules which a building can lose before\nit stops existing (on the first version of the view); or on objections\nto multitudinous temporary coincidents (on the second version of the\nview).\n\nFinally, endurantists could adopt a restricted ontology, as some do in\nresponse to temporary coincidence. If there aren\u2019t really any\nsuch things as bicycles, buildings or lakes, just particles moving\naround and interacting, then there are no issues to resolve about the\ncareers and identities of bicycles, buildings or lakes. As before, the\nmain difficulty here is in reconciling our everyday beliefs with a\nsufficiently restricted ontology: after all, people and even\nfundamental particles seem sometimes to be indeterminate. (Again, it\nis open to perdurantists to adopt a restricted ontology, but typically\nthey do not.)\n\nIn summary then, both perdurantists and endurantists can adopt various\nresponses to apparent vagueness in persistence; which they choose\ndepends in part upon their more general views about the nature of\nvagueness. Typical perdurantists posit temporary coincidence between\nobjects, and a failure on our part to talk determinately about any one\nof these. Endurantists could make the same claim, but typically do\nnot. A temporary-coincidence view could instead be paired with an\nepistemic account of vagueness, and our failure to know which object\nwe\u2019re talking about. Alternatively, vagueness may be either\nattributed to objects themselves, and their failure to have\ndeterminate careers, or else to our failure to know what careers they\nhave. A radical option is to deny that any genuine object is involved\n(thus restricting ontology). In different ways, all of these options\nare available to perdurantists and endurantists alike, but the costs\nand benefits differ.\n\nSuggested Reading: For a way into the general debate\nabout vagueness, try Keefe and Smith (eds.) (1997), and the separate\nentry on\n vagueness.\n Stalnaker (1988) is a particularly nice discussion of vague\npersistence.\u00a0 Issues discussed in this section are covered in\nmore detail by Hawley (2001, chapter 4). Temporal parts accounts of\nvague persistence are defended by Sider (2001, section 4.9) (Sider\npresents a distinctive argument which will be discussed in\n section 8)\n and Heller (2000); these are criticised by Lowe (2005). Romerales\n(2008) compares perdurance and stage theory on this front. Endurantist\nworldly vagueness is defended by van Inwagen (1988; 1990b) and\ndiscussed by Cowles (1994), Garrett (1991), and Hirsch (1999). The\nclassic argument against worldly vagueness in identity can be found in\nEvans (1978) and Salmon (1981). Heller (1996) objects to worldly\nvagueness of all kinds. Hudson (2000) defends an epistemicist temporal\nparts theory. Williamson (1994, chapter 9) discusses an epistemicist\naccount of vague objects. Haslanger (1994) considers multitudes of\ncoinciding endurers, and Sosa (1987; 1999) looks kindly upon the idea,\nas does Kurtsal Steen (2010). Further discussion can also be found in\nthe separate entries on\n ordinary objects\n and on\n identity.\n\n",
