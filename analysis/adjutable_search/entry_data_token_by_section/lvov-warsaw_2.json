    "main_text": "Logic || Polish notation, the requirements for logical systems and metalogical concepts\n3.1 Polish notation, the requirements for logical systems and metalogical concepts\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz invented a parenthesis-free logical notation. The\nidea consisted in writing logical constants before their arguments.\n\u0141ukasiewicz replaced the usual signs for logical operations by\nletters: N (negation), K (conjunction), A\n(disjunction), C (implication) and E (equivalence).\nAny well-formed formula (the present explanations are restricted to\npropositional calculus) must begin with a capital letter\n(propositional variables are symbolized by lower-case Latin letters)\nwhich is the main functor of the entire formula. The main connective\nhas as its arguments variables or formulas consisting of variables and\nconstants. The following are examples: Cpp for (p\n\u2192 p), CCppNq for ((p \u2192\np) \u2192 \u00acq). The structure of a formula (and\nhence also its meaning) in Polish notation is uniquely determined by\nthe position of the letters. The parenthesis-free notation is\nunambiguous in the sense that any finite sequence of symbols for\nconnectives and variables is interpretable in a unique way. This\nimplies that any wff coded in Polish notation has only one translation\ninto the standard symbolism. The main advantage of Polish notation is\nits economy, because it avoids special punctuation devices such as\nbrackets or dots. When \u0141ukasiewicz met Turing in 1949, the latter\nremarked that Polish notation was much better for computers, because\nformulas with function-symbols in front could be better elaborated by\nmechanical devices.\n\nThe parenthesis-free symbolism was closely associated with some ideas\nof Polish logicians concerning the good properties of formal systems.\nOf course, any correct logical system should be consistent and, if\npossible, syntactically and semantically complete. It should also be\nbased on independent sets of primitive terms and axioms. The Warsaw\nSchool of Logic strongly emphasized the last property, often\nconsidered secondary. Thus, the dependence of primitive terms or\naxioms was regarded as an essential defect. Moreover, some additional\nstructural properties of logical systems were recommended: (a) a\nsystem with fewer primitive concepts is better; (b) a system with\nfewer axioms is better; (c) if we define the length of an axiom system\nas the number of symbols occurring in all of its axioms, the shortest\naxiom system is the best; (d) a system with fewer different symbols is\nbetter; (e) if we define an organic theorem as one which has no other\ntheorem inside it (for example, the formula CpCqq is not an\norganic theorem), organic axioms are better than non-organic ones.\nThus, the ideal axiom system consists of a sole organic axiom of the\nshortest possible length, provided that it is consistent. Requirements\n(a)-(f) apply particularly well to propositional calculus. They became\nthe guiding principles of many logical investigations in the Warsaw\nSchool of Logic. Logicians of this school also made precise many\nimportant metalogical concepts, including those of the logical matrix,\nconsequence operation, deductive system and model.\n",
