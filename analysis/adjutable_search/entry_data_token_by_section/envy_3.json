    "main_text": "The Nature of Envy || Envy vs. Resentment\n1.4 Envy vs. Resentment\n\nAlthough much of the psychological literature on envy supposes that\nenvy is concerned with matters of perceived injustice, most\nphilosophers reject this\n suggestion.[10]\n The received view is that envy is to be distinguished from\nresentment. The latter is held to be a moral emotion, whereas the\nformer is not. What makes a given emotion a moral emotion has been\nglossed in various ways. Roughly, the idea is that moral emotions are\nones that somehow embody moral principles or appraisals. Resentment is\na moral emotion because a given emotional episode does not qualify as\na state of resentment unless the subject holds some moral complaint\nagainst the object of the state. The claim that envy is not a moral\nemotion should be understood as a denial that any moral complaint is\npart of the nature of envy as such. It is compatible with the\npossibility of any number of cases in which envious people also hold\nmoral complaints against those they envy. And it is also compatible\nwith the possibility of envying someone for some moral feature.\n\nIt seems clear that in many (perhaps even most) cases of envy, the\nsubject is liable to find some moral complaint with which to justify\nnegative feelings toward his rival. This would explain various\nexperimental findings that correlate feelings of envy with complaints\nof injustice. But, of course, such complaints may be defensive\nrationalizations of rancorous feelings, rather than elements in envy.\nClaims about which of the various thoughts that commonly attend a\ngiven type of emotion belong in a characterization of that emotion\ntype are best defended within the context of a general theory of how\nto individuate emotion types, which is beyond the scope of this entry.\nIn any case, some version of the thesis that envy is not a moral\nemotion seems both plausible and necessary to make sense of the debate\nover whether egalitarianism is motivated by envy (see section 3.1\nbelow).\n",
