Presocratic Thinking about the Soul\n\n The semantic expansion of \u2018soul\u2019 in the sixth and fifth\ncenturies is reflected in the philosophical writings of the\nperiod. For instance, once it becomes natural to speak of soul as what\ndistinguishes the animate from the inanimate, rather than as something\nthat is restricted to humans, it becomes clear that the domain of\nensouled things is not limited to animals, but includes plants as\nwell. Empedocles and, apparently, Pythagoras (cf. Bremmer 1983, 125)\nthought that plants have souls, and that human souls, for instance,\ncan come to animate plants. (Note, though, that Empedocles, in extant\nfragments, rarely uses the word \u2018soul\u2019, preferring the\nword daim\u00f4n.) Empedocles in fact claimed to have been a\nbush in a previous incarnation, as well as, among other things, a bird\nand a fish (fr.  117, Kirk, Raven & Schofield 1983 [in what\nfollows KR&S], 417).  Incidentally, Empedocles, like Anaxagoras\nand Democritus, referred to plants as animals, presumably precisely\nbecause they are alive (z\u00ean, from which the word for\nanimal, z\u00f4on, derives) (for details, cf. Skemp 1947,\n56). In this he was followed by Plato (Timaeus 77b), but\nemphatically not by Aristotle (De Anima 2.2, 413b1f).\n\n There is, moreover, some reason to think that philosophical activity,\nnotably Pythagorean speculation (beginning around mid-sixth century),\ncontributed to the semantic expansion of \u2018soul\u2019. As we\nhave seen, at least some of the earliest extant texts that associate\nwith the soul moral virtues other than courage suggest Pythagorean\ninfluence. It is, in fact, not difficult to see how Pythagoreanism may\nhave furthered the expansion of \u2018soul\u2019.  Pythagoreanism\nwas concerned with, among other things, the continued existence of the\nperson (or something suitably person-like) after death. It is obvious\nthat against the Homeric background, \u2018soul\u2019 was an\neminently appropriate word to use so as to denote the person, or\nquasi-person, that continued to exist after death; there was, after\nall, the familiar Homeric use of \u2018soul\u2019 as that which\nendures in the underworld after a person's death. To make the\ncontinued existence of this soul significant as the continued\nexistence of the person in question, at least some of the states,\nactivities, operations and the like that seemed crucial to the\nidentity of the person had to be attributed to the soul (following\nFurley 1956, 11, who goes further than that, writing of the need for\nthe soul \u201cto include all the functions of\npersonality\u201d; cf. Barnes 1982, 103-6; Huffman forthcoming). This\ntendency is well illustrated by a story about Pythagoras, reported by\nXenophanes (fr. 7, KR&S 260): \u201cOnce, they say, he was\npassing by when a puppy was being whipped, and he took pity and said:\n\u2018Stop, do not beat it; it is the soul of a friend that I\nrecognized when I heard its [i.e., the soul's!]  voice.\u2019\u201d\nIt is not just that the soul of Pythagoras' friend accounts for the\ncharacter of the yelping (or whatever).  Pythagoras is in fact quoted\nas saying that it is his friend's soul that is doing the yelping! \n\n Heraclitus (fl. around 500 BC), who repeatedly mentions Pythagoras,\nattributes wisdom to the soul provided that it is in the right state\nor condition: \u201ca dry soul\u201d, he claims, \u201cis wisest\nand best\u201d (fr. 118, KR&S 230). He may have been the first\nthinker to articulate a connection between soul and motor\nfunctions. \u201cA man when he is drunk\u201d, Heraclitus remarks,\n\u201cis led by an unfledged boy, stumbling and not knowing where he\ngoes, having his soul moist\u201d (fr. 117, KR&S 231). On the\nmost plausible construal of Heraclitus' sentence, he is saying that\nthe drunken person stumbles because his perceptual abilities have been\nimpaired, and this impairment is due to moistness of soul (Schofield\n1991, 22). Like many (or indeed all) sixth and fifth century thinkers\nwho expressed views on the nature or constitution of the soul,\nHeraclitus thought that the soul was bodily, but composed of an\nunusually fine or rare kind of matter, e.g. air or fire. (A possible\nexception is the Pythagorean Philolaus, who may have held that the\nsoul is an \u2018attunement\u2019 of the body; cf. Barnes 1982,\n488-95,\n and Huffman.)\n The prevalence of the idea that the soul is bodily explains the\nabsence of problems about the relation between soul and body. Soul and\nbody were not thought to be radically different in kind; their\ndifference seemed just to consist in a difference in degree of\nproperties such as fineness and mobility. \n",
