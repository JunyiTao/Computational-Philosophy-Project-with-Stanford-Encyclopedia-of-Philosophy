    "main_text": "The Southwest School || Conception of Philosophy: Philosophy as Theory of Value\n3.1 Conception of Philosophy: Philosophy as Theory of Value\n\n\u201cKant posed a new conception of philosophy\u2019s task and mode\nof knowledge against the psychologism of his contemporaries\u201d,\nWindelband writes in his programmatic essay, \u201cCritical or\nGenetic Method?\u201d (Windelband 1883: 271). On this Kantian view,\nWindelband asserts, philosophy\u2019s subject matter is the\n\u201cvalidity\u201d [Geltung] of \u201caxioms\u201d.\nPhilosophy must identify these axioms, put them into a system, and\nexplain how these axioms govern the activities of knowing, acting, and\njudging. This latter task requires giving a general account of\nvalidity, in addition to identifying how the various sciences and\nareas of culture are governed by specific axioms. Logic (or\ntheoretical philosophy, or \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d) is the\nscience of the axioms for knowing; ethics is the science of the norms\nfor acting; aesthetics is\nthe science of the rules of the \u201ceffects of the emotions\u201d\n(1883: 274\u20135). \n\nThis conception of philosophy furnishes the SW School with an antidote\nto psychologism, which differs fundamentally from the kind of\nanti-psychologism proferred by the Marburg school (see\n section 2.1).\n For Windelband, axioms are understood \u201cteleologically\u201d:\nthey are the rules that must be followed if certain ends are to be\nrealized. For instance, logic gives those norms that must be followed\nif one wants to believe what is true. Axioms are norms, and\ntheir necessity is normative necessity. Essentially,\nphilosophy is distinct from psychology because norms are distinct from\nfacts. The norms that, as a matter of fact, people do recognize have\nonly \u201cfactual validity\u201d, and not \u201cteleological\n validity\u201d.[17]\n What Windelband calls the \u201cgenetic method\u201d recognizes\nonly factual validity or generality. It seeks to demonstrate the\nvalidity of axioms by showing that these axioms are built into our\npsychology, or are universal to all cultures. The genetic method\ntherefore makes philosophy dependent on psychology and cultural\nhistory. But the genetic method is hopeless: one cannot prove the\naxioms that govern all sciences by using psychology or anthropology,\nsince these sciences themselves presuppose these axioms. Indeed, the\ngenetic method threatens relativism, since we cannot say what humans\nwill believe at all times and places, but only what they believe now,\nor what is believed in this or that culture. Indeed, on the genetic\nmethod, truth and goodness are reduced to social power or majority\nopinion.\n\nThe critical method, on the other hand, begins with the assumption\nthat there are universal, absolute values which all subjects ought to\nrecognize and conform to. It postulates a \u201cnormal consciousness\nwhose principles must be recognized, insofar as anything at all is to\nhave universal validity\u201d (Windelband 1883: 280). This normal\n consciousness,[18]\n inasmuch as it embodies a norm, is not an empirically real subject\nand cannot be investigated using the genetic method. The\n\u201caxioms\u201d, which form the subject matter of philosophy, are\nthe principles that must have normative force if there is to be a\nnormal consciousness at all. These axioms are \u201cmeans to the end\nof universal validity\u201d (1883: 281)\u2014they are the norms that\nmust be recognized if there are to be any universally valid norms at\nall. For example, there could be a normal consciousness in a world\nwhere ripe tomatoes are blue and not red. Thus the norm \u201cBelieve\nthat ripe tomatoes are red\u201d, though it is true and thus\nuniversally valid in our world, is not an axiom\u2014not a norm whose\nrecognition is a precondition of universal validity. The law of\ncontradiction, on the other hand, is a precondition of universal\nvalidity. No matter what color ripe tomatoes are in our world, there\nwould be no point in adopting the norm \u201cBelieve that ripe\ntomatoes are red\u201d as a norm of truth, unless we also\nrecognize the demand to avoid contradictions. The proof that these\naxioms are the indispensable preconditions of universal validity\ncannot be empirical, as the genetic method would require.\n\nThe defining claim of SW Neo-Kantianism is that there are universally\nvalid norms, and every universally valid norm has an a priori\n ground.[19]\n The concept of the a priori is therefore not a psychological or\nbiological notion (the a priori is not the innate), nor is it an\nanthropological notion (the a priori is not what is universally\nassented to). The a priori are norms, the recognition of which is\nindispensable for normative activities. In theoretical philosophy, the\na priori are norms the recognition of which are necessary for making\nuniversally valid judgments\u2014judgments that make a claim to\ntruth, truth for every other cognizer. These a priori theoretical\nnorms include the laws of logic. For natural science, the law of\ncausality is an a priori norm; for history (see\n section 3.3),\n it is a priori that there are universal values that make certain\nindividuals historically significant (Rickert 1902: 334). Similarly,\nthere are universally binding norms in ethics and aesthetics, which\nmake it possible that certain actions and emotions are universally\nvalid.\n\nLask agrees with his teachers in characterizing philosophy as the\nscience of validity (Lask 1911: 401). He recognizes, however, that the\nSW Neo-Kantian insistence on the objectivity of what is valid, along\nwith their distinction between the factual and the normative,\nthreatens to devolve into a \u201ctwo world\u201d metaphysics that\nis potentially incompatible with Kantianism. In fact, Lotze (Lask\nargues) opted precisely for such a two world theory, where what is\nvalid is set over against what is, or has\nbeing. This dualism is unpalatable, since it would leave it\nunexplained how senses (i.e., the contents of our sentences) come to\nbe true of what is, thus reigniting the question (famously posed by\nKant in his 1772 letter to Herz) about how representations can relate\nto objects at all. Lask thus argued that Neo-Kantianism had to be\ncompleted by taking a Kantian \u201cCopernican\n Turn\u201d[20]\n (Lask 1911: First Part, \u00a71). Just as Kant argued that the object\nmust conform to our cognition of it, Lask holds that both the senses\nof our sentences and the objects that have being share a form\n(\u00a72). The form of a sense is theoretical validity\n[G\u00fcltigkeit], and the form of an object is objectivity\n[Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit]. The Copernican view, then, is that\ntheoretical validity just is objectivity. The two world theory thus\nbecomes a two element theory (\u00a73). There is one realm (the realm\nof theoretical sense or being), within which we can distinguish a\nformal element and a material element. The formal element is validity,\nwhich is the subject matter of philosophy, while the material element\nis sensible. Validity, however, is not supersensible (such as the\nobjects of dogmatic theology or cosmology would be), but rather\n\u201cnon-sensible\u201d, since it is an element in the sensible\nobjects of our experience.\n\nLast, it should be emphasized that for Windelband and the rest of the\nSW Neo-Kantians, the goal of the critical philosophy is to be an\n\u201call-encompassing philosophy of culture\u201d (Windelband\n1910). In particular, they wanted to expand Kant\u2019s critical\nproject to those areas of culture that Kant\u2019s original draft of\ncritical philosophy had neglected: the so-called\n\u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d, principally history.\n",
