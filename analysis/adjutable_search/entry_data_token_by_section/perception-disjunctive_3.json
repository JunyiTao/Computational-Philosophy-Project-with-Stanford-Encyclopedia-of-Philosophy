    "main_text": "Varieties of Disjunctivism || Disjunctivism about Intentional Content\n2.2 Disjunctivism about Intentional Content\n\n\nAccording to an intentionalist account of perceptual experience, our\nperceptual experiences are mental events (or states) with intentional\ncontents that represent the world as being a certain way. The\ndisjunctivist who accepts this general approach to perceptual\nexperience may hold that a veridical perception has an intentional\ncontent that a hallucination cannot have. For example this sort of\ndisjunctivist may hold that the intentional content of a veridical\nperception is constitutively dependent on mind-independent objects,\nwhile the intentional content of a hallucination is not.\n\n\nOne route to this view proceeds through the claims that a veridical\nperception of the world is a perceptual state with an intentional\ncontent containing demonstrative elements that refer to the\nmind-independent items in the environment that are perceived, and that\ntruth-evaluable intentional contents with demonstrative elements that\nsuccessfully refer are object-dependent. On this view, a particular\nexperience E that is a veridical perception of a particular\nmind-independent object O will have an intentional content\nwith a demonstrative element that successfully refers to O,\nand a distinct particular experience E* will have\nan intentional content with the same veridicality conditions only if\nits intentional content contains a demonstrative element that also\nrefers to O. If E* is a hallucination it\nwill not have an intentional content with a demonstrative element that\nsuccessfully refers to O, so it will not have an intentional\ncontent with the same veridicality conditions as E. Suppose\nwe now add the following assumption: If two experiences have\nintentional contents which differ in their veridicality conditions,\nthen this is not just a respect in which these mental events differ,\nit is also amounts to a difference in their mental kinds. We can now\nderive the conclusion that veridical perceptions and hallucinations\nare experiences of different mental kinds. This last assumption needs\nto be made explicit, as it is not agreed upon by all (e.g., Burge\n1993, 2005 and 2010). Note that acceptance of the assumption would\nalso commit one to the following claim: If E* is a\nveridical perception of numerically distinct object\nO*, then E and E* are\nto be regarded as experiences of different mental kinds even if\nO and O* are perceptually indiscernible\nto the subject who perceives them. (For discussion of the status of\nthat assumption, see Mehta 2014, Gomes and French 2016, Mehta and\nGarson 2016, and French and Gomes 2019).\n\n\nSomeone who holds this sort of view may claim that it is possible for\na veridical perception and a hallucination to have the same phenomenal\ncharacter. For they may claim that it is possible for experiences to\nhave the same phenomenal character despite the fact that they do not\nhave the same intentional content. According to the terminology that\nByrne and Logue adopt (see section 2.1.2) this would make the view\na moderate one. Someone adopting the moderate approach might\nclaim that hallucinations have an existentially quantified intentional\ncontent and veridical perceptions also have a layer of content that is\nexistential. They might then hold that this layer of existential\ncontent, which is present in experience whether or not one is\nveridically perceiving the world, provides a common mental factor for\nveridical and hallucinatory experiences.\n\n\nTye (2007) favours a different \u2018moderate\u2019 approach. He\nholds that veridical perceptions have object-dependent singular\nintentional contents that hallucinations cannot have, and he holds\nthat veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have the same\nphenomenal character. However, he rejects the claim that there is a\nlayer of existential content that provides a common mental factor for\nveridical and hallucinatory experiences. According to Tye, veridical\nperceptions and hallucinations have intentional contents that\nrepresent clusters of properties. In the case of veridical perception\nthe cluster of properties is represented within a content that is\nsingular and object-dependent, whereas in the case of hallucination\nthe cluster of properties is represented within a content that is\n\u2018gappy\u2019. (See also Schellenberg 2010, 2013, and 2016.)\nTye\u2019s suggestion is that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations have contents with a common structure, and this\nstructure may be conceived as having a slot in it for an object. In\nthe case of veridical perception the slot is filled by the object\nperceived, and in the case of hallucination the slot is empty, and\nhence the content is \u2018gappy\u2019. Tye claims that the\nphenomenal character of a given visual experience is the cluster of\nproperties represented by that experience. And he claims that this is\nwhy veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have the same\nphenomenal character.\n",
