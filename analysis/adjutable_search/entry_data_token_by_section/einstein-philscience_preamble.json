    "main_text": "\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879\u20131955) is well known as the most prominent\nphysicist of the twentieth century. His contributions to\ntwentieth-century philosophy of science, though of comparable\nimportance, are less well known. Einstein\u2019s own philosophy of science\nis an original synthesis of elements drawn from sources as diverse as\nneo-Kantianism, conventionalism, and logical empiricism, its\ndistinctive feature being its novel blending of realism with a holist,\nunderdeterminationist form of conventionalism. Of special note is the\nmanner in which Einstein\u2019s philosophical thinking was driven by and\ncontributed to the solution of problems first encountered in his work\nin physics. Equally significant are Einstein\u2019s relations with and\ninfluence on other prominent twentieth-century philosophers of\nscience, including Moritz Schlick, Hans Reichenbach, Ernst Cassirer,\nPhilipp Frank, Henri Bergson, \u00c9mile Meyerson.\n",
