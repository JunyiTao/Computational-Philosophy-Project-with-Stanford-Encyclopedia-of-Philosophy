    "main_text": "Justification and Beyond || Extended Mind\n3.2 Extended Mind\n\nCognitive processing may not be limited to biological\nbrain-processing. It may extend also to artifacts inside the skull, or\neven outside. A subject\u2019s notebook, for example, may be a part\nof his cognitive processing, in the way his memory is part of his\ncognitive processing (Clark & Chalmers 1998). Information stored\nin the notebook can be part of the subject\u2019s dispositional\nmemory knowledge (Carter & Kallestrup 2016). The subject does not\ninstead merely relearn the information upon accessing it. Knowledge\nmay not only extend to memory technology, but this knowledge may in\nways be better than knowledge from biomemory (Carter 2018; Heersmink\n& Carter 2020). It may for example be more stable and less\neffortful to maintain. Michaelian (2012a), however, argues that an\nimportant case for the extended cognition hypothesis fails. The case\nhighlights functional similarity between biomemory and alleged memory\nthat is external to the subject\u2019s body. The case specifically\nhas to do with their similar, purely preservative functioning. But,\nMichaelian argues, biomemory lacks this function, so alleged external\nmemory is not relevantly similar to biomemory after all. Notably, the\nview that biomemory has a purely preservative function has in part\nmotivated views about its epistemic powers, such as both versions of\npreservationism.\n",
