Russell\u2019s Theory of Definite Descriptions\n\nRussell\u2019s philosophical method has at its core the making and\ntesting of hypotheses through the weighing of evidence. Hence\nRussell\u2019s comment that he wished to emphasize the\n\u201cscientific method\u201d in philosophy. His method also\nrequires the rigorous analysis of problematic propositions using the\nmachinery of first-order logic. It was Russell\u2019s belief that by\nusing the new logic of his day, philosophers would be able to exhibit\nthe underlying \u201clogical form\u201d of natural-language\nstatements. A statement\u2019s logical form, in turn, would help\nresolve various problems of reference associated with the ambiguity\nand vagueness of natural language. \n\nSince the introduction of the modern predicate calculus, it has been\ncommon to use three separate logical notations\n(\u201cPx\u201d, \u201cx = y\u201d, and\n\u201c\u2203x\u201d) to represent three separate senses of\nthe natural-language word \u201cis\u201d: the is of\npredication, e.g. \u201cCicero is wise\u201d; the is of\nidentity, e.g. \u201cCicero is Tully\u201d; and the is of\nexistence, e.g. \u201cCicero is\u201d. It was Russell\u2019s\nsuggestion that, just as we use logic to make clear these\ndistinctions, we can also use logic to discover other ontologically\nsignificant distinctions, distinctions that should be reflected in the\nanalysis we give of each sentence\u2019s correct logical form. \n\nOn Russell\u2019s view, the subject matter of philosophy is then\ndistinguished from that of the sciences only by the generality and\na prioricity of philosophical statements, not by the\nunderlying methodology of the discipline. In philosophy, just as in\nmathematics, Russell believed that it was by applying logical\nmachinery and insights that advances in analysis would be made.\n\nRussell\u2019s most famous example of his new \u201canalytic\nmethod\u201d concerns so-called denoting phrases, phrases that\ninclude both\n definite descriptions\n and proper names. Like\n Alexius Meinong,\n Russell had initially adopted the view that every denoting phrase\n(for example, \u201cScott,\u201d \u201cthe author of\nWaverley,\u201d \u201cthe number two,\u201d \u201cthe\ngolden mountain\u201d) denoted, or referred to, an existing entity.\nOn this view, even fictional and imaginary entities had to be real in\norder to serve as truth-makers for true sentences such as\n\u201cUnicorns have exactly one horn.\u201d By the time his landmark\narticle, \u201cOn Denoting,\u201d appeared in 1905, Russell had\nmodified his extreme realism, substituting in its place the view that\ndenoting phrases need not possess a theoretical unity. As Russell puts\nit, the assumption that every denoting phrase must refer to an\nexisting entity was the type of assumption that exhibited \u201ca\nfailure of that feeling for reality which ought to be preserved even\nin the most abstract studies\u201d (1919a, 165).\n\nWhile logically proper names (words such as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cthat\u201d which refer to sensations of which an agent is\nimmediately aware) do have referents associated with them, descriptive\nphrases (such as \u201cthe smallest number less than pi\u201d)\nshould be viewed merely as collections of quantifiers (such as\n\u201call\u201d and \u201csome\u201d) and\n propositional functions\n (such as \u201cx is a number\u201d). As such, they are not\nto be viewed as referring terms but, rather, as \u201cincomplete\nsymbols.\u201d In other words, they are to be viewed as symbols that\ntake on meaning within appropriate contexts, but that remain\nmeaningless in isolation.\n\nPut another way, it was Russell\u2019s insight that some phrases may\ncontribute to the meaning (or reference) of a sentence without\nthemselves being meaningful. As he explains, \n\nIf \u201cthe author of Waverley\u201d meant anything other\nthan \u201cScott\u201d, \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverley\u201d would be false, which it is not. If\n\u201cthe author of Waverley\u201d meant\n\u201cScott\u201d, \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverley\u201d would be a tautology, which it is not.\nTherefore, \u201cthe author of Waverley\u201d means neither\n\u201cScott\u201d nor anything else \u2013 i.e. \u201cthe author\nof Waverley\u201d means nothing, Q.E.D. (1959, 85)\n\n\nIf Russell is correct, it follows that in a sentence such as\n\n(1) The present King of France is bald,\n\n\nthe definite description \u201cThe present King of France\u201d\nplays a role quite different from the role a proper name such as\n\u201cScott\u201d plays in the sentence \n\n(2) Scott is bald.\n\n\nLetting K abbreviate the predicate \u201cis a present King\nof France\u201d and B abbreviate the predicate \u201cis\nbald,\u201d Russell assigns sentence (1) the logical form \n\n(1\u2032) There is an x such that\n\n\nKx,\nfor any y, if Ky then y=x, and \nBx.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, in the notation of the predicate calculus, we write\n\n\n(1\u2033) \u2203x[(Kx &\n\u2200y(Ky \u2192 y=x)) &\nBx].\n\n\nIn contrast, by allowing s to abbreviate the name\n\u201cScott,\u201d Russell assigns sentence (2) the very different\nlogical form \n\n(2\u2032) Bs.\n\n\nThis distinction between logical forms allows Russell to explain three\nimportant puzzles. \n\nThe first concerns the operation of the Law of Excluded Middle and how\nthis law relates to denoting terms. According to one reading of the\nLaw of Excluded Middle, it must be the case that either \u201cThe\npresent King of France is bald\u201d is true or \u201cThe present\nKing of France is not bald\u201d is true. But if so, both sentences\nappear to entail the existence of a present King of France, clearly an\nundesirable result, given that France is a republic and so has no\nking. Russell\u2019s analysis shows how this conclusion can be\navoided. By appealing to analysis (1\u2032\u2032), it follows that\nthere is a way to deny (1) without being committed to the existence of\na present King of France, namely by changing the scope of the negation\noperator and thereby accepting that \u201cIt is not the case that\nthere exists a present King of France who is bald\u201d is true.\n\nThe second puzzle concerns the Law of Identity as it operates in\n(so-called) opaque contexts. Even though \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverley\u201d is true, it does not follow that the two\nreferring terms \u201cScott\u201d and \u201cthe author of\nWaverley\u201d need be interchangeable in every situation.\nThus, although \u201cGeorge IV wanted to know whether Scott was the\nauthor of Waverley\u201d is true, \u201cGeorge IV wanted to\nknow whether Scott was Scott\u201d is, presumably, false. \n\nRussell\u2019s distinction between the logical forms associated with\nthe use of proper names and definite descriptions again shows why this\nis so. To see this, we once again let s abbreviate the name\n\u201cScott.\u201d We also let w abbreviate\n\u201cWaverley\u201d and A abbreviate the\ntwo-place predicate \u201cis the author of.\u201d It then follows\nthat the sentence\n\n(3) s=s\n\n\nis not at all equivalent to the sentence \n\n(4) \u2203x[(Axw &\n\u2200y(Ayw \u2192 y=x)) &\nx=s].\n\n\nSentence (3), for example, is a necessary truth, while sentence (4) is\nnot. \n\nThe third puzzle relates to true negative existential claims, such as\nthe claim \u201cThe golden mountain does not exist.\u201d Here, once\nagain, by treating definite descriptions as having a logical form\ndistinct from that of proper names, Russell is able to give an account\nof how a speaker may be committed to the truth of a negative\nexistential without also being committed to the belief that the\nsubject term has reference. That is, the claim that Scott does not\nexist is false since \n\n(5) ~\u2203x(x=s)\n\n\nis self-contradictory. (After all, there must exist at least one thing\nthat is identical to s since it is a logical truth that\ns is identical to itself!) In contrast, the claim that a\ngolden mountain does not exist may be true since, assuming that\nG abbreviates the predicate \u201cis golden\u201d and\nM abbreviates the predicate \u201cis a mountain,\u201d\nthere is nothing contradictory about\n\n(6) ~\u2203x(Gx & Mx).\n\n\nRussell\u2019s most important writings relating to his theory of\ndescriptions include not only \u201cOn Denoting\u201d (1905), but\nalso The Principles of Mathematics (1903), Principia\nMathematica (1910) and Introduction to Mathematical\nPhilosophy (1919).
