    "main_text": "Dance and Cognitive Science\n4. Dance and Cognitive Science\n\nThe number of dance philosophers who are interested and involved in\nusing empirical research in the cognitive sciences to help our\nunderstanding of the cognitive-physical components of making dance art\nin actions, events and performances is large and growing. These\ninclude Bl\u00e4sing et al. 2012 and Bl\u00e4sing et al. 2019;\nBresnahan 2014a; Cross and Ticini 2012; Hagendoorn 2012; Katan 2016;\nJang and Pollick 2011; He and Ravn 2018; Jola, Ehrenberg, and Reynolds\n2012; Legrand and Ravn 2009; McKechnie and Stevens 2009; Merritt 2015;\nMontero 2006a, 2006b, 2010, 2012, and 2013; Seeley 2011 and 2013;\nVass-Rhee 2018. Maxine Sheets-Johnstone\u2019s body of dance\nphilosophy work that incorporates research from the cognitive and\nother sciences is so extensive that they would require their own entry\nto list in full (see the ones in this entry\u2019s bibliography for a\nstart). See Bresnahan 2017a for an account of how dance training\naffects our temporal experience and Bresnahan 2019a for the view that\nexpert dance movements are often experienced and perceived via\nsubconscious processes before they are fully cognized. For a series of\nsustained arguments against the philosophical fruitfulness of using\ninsights from cognitive science see McFee 2003, 2011a, and 2018.\n\nMontero has written on how proprioception (the capacity that lets a\nperson know their bodily position in space) might be construed as an\naesthetic sense, how mirror neurons might be part of an audience\nexperience of this sense, and how trained dancers might make better\naesthetic judges at least in part due to some of these mechanisms.\n(See the discussion on expertise that precedes this discussion in\n Section 3.3.)\n Carroll is one philosopher who has followed Montero\u2019s research\n(see Carroll and Moore 2011) in his thinking about how dance and music\nmight work together to affect our kinaesthetic responses. He has also\nconsidered (see Carroll and Seeley 2013) how Montero\u2019s research\nand other research in neuroscience might bolster dance critic John\nMartin\u2019s theory of \u201cmetakinetic transfer\u201d from dance\nperformers to audience dances. (For more on Martin\u2019s theory of\n\u201cmetakinetic transfer\u201d, which he says is due to\n\u201cmuscular sympathy\u201d and \u201cinner mimicry\u201d see\nMartin 1939 and Franko 1996.)\n\nThe philosophers who support the use of research on neurological\nprocessing of kinesthetic responses to dance in general hold that it\nis relevant to our proper understanding of dance qua the art\nof dance. Carroll and Seeley (2013) argue, for example, that one of\nthe central features of understanding dance is to understand the\nnature of the experience of dance in all its aspects, cognitive as\nwell as kinesthetic and felt. Thus, connecting this\nexperience with causal explanations is elucidating and appropriate to\na full and broad understanding of that experience in all of\nits aspects. This can be called the \u201cmoderately optimistic\nview\u201d, following D. Davies 2013. D. Davies\u2019 own answer to\nthe question of how scientific research can be used in understanding\nand appreciating dance is what he calls the \u201cmoderately\npessimistic\u201d view (2013). He agrees with McFee that there are\nsome questions relevant to philosophical dance aesthetics that cannot\nbe answered by empirical research, no matter how accurate that\nresearch may be for answering certain scientific, causal questions.\nThere are normative questions, for example, such as \u201cwhat counts\nas proper appreciation of a work of art?\u201d that science cannot\nanswer. Empirical research, where used by dance and other\nphilosophers, must, according to D. Davies, be applied carefully to\nthe relevant questions (see 2011a and 2013; see also 2014).\n\nD. Davies (2013) is only moderately pessimistic about empirical\nresearch, however, because he thinks that philosophy ought not to\npartition itself away from science and away from other disciplines\nthat might inform our thinking. Here he suggests that we ought to\nfollow the Quinean idea that philosophy ought to respond to and at\nleast be cognizant of current science so that we know how our\nphilosophic views fit into our web of other beliefs about the world.\nD. Davies (2013) is also sympathetic with the part of Seeley\u2019s\nview (in Seeley 2011) that holds that empirical research can at least\nhelp us to avoid false assumptions pertaining to the arts that are\ntacitly or explicitly based on empirical misunderstandings. (For a\nfull discussion of the various optimisms and pessimisms regarding how\nempirical research can affect our understanding of art here see Bullot\net al. 2017.)\n\nMcFee (2011a, 2013b and 2018) denies that causal explanations about\nkinesthetic responses are ever relevant to dance appreciation. This\nview can be called (following D. Davies 2013) \u201cthe extremely\npessimistic view\u201d. McFee holds that causal accounts,\nparticularly from the sciences, of the appreciation and experience of\ndance, either in terms of kinesthetic responses or anything else,\nare never relevant to understanding dance as art. He says\nthat the idea that \u201cour bodily reactions\u2014our toe-tapping,\nsitting up straight, holding our breaths, tensing our legs, and so\non\u201d is relevant to dance appreciation \u201cmakes no\nsense\u201d (2013b: 189, a view reinforced in 2018). His thought here\nis that dance appreciation happens at the level of a person\nwho appreciates, someone with the cultural resources to understand\ndance as a form of art, not at the level of neurobiology. Montero,\nCarroll and Seeley would probably agree that kinesthetic responses\ncannot alone provide an appreciation of dance as art. The difference\nis that, unlike McFee, they think that neurobiologic studies can\ncontribute to our understanding of dance as art in some ways. (For\nmore on McFee\u2019s view here see McFee 2003, 2013b, and 2018. For\nanother neuroscientific approach to audience engagement with dance see\nSeeley 2013.)\n",
