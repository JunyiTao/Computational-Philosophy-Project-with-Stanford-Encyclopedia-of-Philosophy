On\nanother reading, however, this question simply asks for a rough guide\nto what sort of things we are speaking of when we speak of\n\u2018abilities\u2019. So understood, this question is not asking\nfor a theory of ability, but for an explanation of what exactly a\ntheory of ability would be a theory of. This section will\noffer an answer to this question on this second, more modest,\nreading.\n",
