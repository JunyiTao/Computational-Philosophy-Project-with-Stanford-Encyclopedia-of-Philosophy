    "main_text": "Objections to Fictionalism and Responses || Other Objections\n3. Conclusion\n\nThere are several different objections to fictionalism out there,\nbut fictionalists have responses to all of them, and it is not at all\nobvious that any of the objections succeeds in refuting fictionalism.\nThus, at the present time, it seems at least prima facie plausible to\nsuppose that fictionalism can be defended. On the other hand, if the\nclaims of section 1 are correct, then fictionalists do not have a\ncompelling positive argument in favor of their view. The arguments of\nsections 1.2\u20131.4 suggest that there are good reasons for\nrejecting the various anti-platonistic alternatives to fictionalism\nand, hence, for thinking that platonism and fictionalism are the two\nbest views of mathematics, but there does not seem to be any good\nargument for favoring fictionalism over platonism or vice\nversa. Now, most fictionalists would probably say\u2014and some\nhave said (see, e.g., Leng, 2010)\u2014that this situation\nitself already gives us a good reason to favor fictionalism over\nplatonism. For if we take the claim that there is no good positive\nargument for platonism and we combine it with Ockham\u2019s razor\n(i.e., the principle that tells us that if two theories account for\nall the same facts, then, ceteris parabis, we ought to\nendorse the more ontologically parsimonious of the two), then we seem\nto be led to the result that fictionalism is superior to platonism. It\nshould be noted, however, that this argument is explicitly rejected by\nat least two of the defenders of fictionalism discussed above. Rosen\n(see, e.g., Burgess and Rosen, 1997) doubts that there is any good\nreason to accept Ockham\u2019s razor, and Balaguer (1998a) argues\nthat even if we accept it, there are reasons to think that it is not\napplicable in the present case. Thus, Rosen and Balaguer both think\nthat, at present, we do not have any good reason to endorse platonism\nor fictionalism. Moreover, as was noted in section 1.3, Bueno (2009)\nthinks fictionalists should be agnostic about the existence\nof abstract objects; this seems to be more or less equivalent to\nRosen\u2019s view; Balaguer\u2019s view is a bit different because\nhe actually thinks that there\u2019s no fact of the matter whether\nabstract objects exist. \n",
