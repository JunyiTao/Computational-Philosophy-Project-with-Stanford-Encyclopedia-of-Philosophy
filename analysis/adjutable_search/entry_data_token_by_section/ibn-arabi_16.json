    "main_text": "The Return || Stages of Ascent\n5.2 Stages of Ascent\n\nIt was noted that one of Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s cosmological\nschemes describes the universe in terms of twenty-eight letters that\narticulate words in the All-Merciful Breath. Twenty-one of these\nletters correspond to stages of the descending arc, which reaches its\nlowest point with the four elements. The remaining letters designate\nthe stages of the ascending arc, beginning with minerals, going on to\nplants, animals, angels, and jinn, and then on to man, the\ntwenty-seventh letter. The twenty-eighth and final letter designates\n\u201cthe levels, stations, and stages\u201d, that is, the invisible\ndegrees of perfection achieved by the unfolding of human souls on the\npath of the Return.\n\nThe decisive difference between animals and humans lies not in speech\nor rationality, but rather in the fact that man was created in the\nform of God per se, that is, God as designated by the\nall-comprehensive name. Everything else was created under the care of\nless comprehensive names. Adam\u2019s divine form is God\u2019s\nall-inclusive face, the Reality of Realities that embraces the full\nrange of possible entifications of Nondelimited Being. The human\nmicrocosm has the potential to realize\u2014that is, to actualize the\nreality of\u2014everything present in the Book of the Cosmos and the\nBook of Scripture. Just as the visible, corporeal world came into\nmanifestation by way of several stages of entification, beginning with\nthe Reality of Realities and descending by way of the invisible worlds\nuntil it reached the minerals, so also the \u201clevels, stations,\nand stages\u201d come into existence through the on-going\nself-disclosure of Real Being in the invisible realms of the ascending\narc and reach their fruition when they return to the Origin. It is at\nthat point that the circle of existence is completed, the dividing\nline disappears, and the imaginal distinction between Real and\ncreation is effaced. As Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee writes:\n\n\u201cHe was two-bows\u2019-length away.\u201d Nothing makes the\ntwo bows/arcs manifest from the circle save the imagined line. It is\nsufficient that you have said that it is \u201cimagined\u201d, since\nthe imagined is that which has no existence in its entity\u2026 .\nThe cosmos, next to the Real, is something imagined to have existence,\nnot an existent thing. The existent thing and existence are nothing\nbut the Entity of the Real. This is His words, \u201cOr\ncloser.\u201d The \u201ccloser\u201d is the removal of this\nimagined thing. When it is removed from imagination, nothing remains\nbut a circle, and the two arcs are not entified. (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n4:40.9)\n\n\nHuman embodiment at the visible level represents an essential stage in\nthe manifestation of the Reality of Realities, but realization of that\nReality takes place within the soul, that is, on the imaginal and\nspiritual levels. The possibilities of manifestation represented by\nplants and animals are relatively limited; external appearance reveals\ntheir secrets to observers, and no one confuses a cabbage with a\ncarrot, or a horse with a donkey. But such is not the case with human\nbeings, whose external uniformity conceals an unlimited inner\ndiversity. The imaginal and spiritual contours of human souls, their\nawareness and character traits, can never be judged by the\nbody\u2019s appearance; human virtue and vice pertain to unseen\nrealms. Culture, art, literature, politics, science, technology, and\nother peculiarly human accomplishments are the soul\u2019s\nexteriorizations. Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee is not concerned, however,\nwith every human possibility, because the paths that lead away from\nthe full and balanced realization of the divine form are legion.\nRather, he wants to delineate the broad contours of the perfections of\ndeiformity, for it is these that lead to harmony with the Real in the\nposthumous realms. Even on this level, however, it is impossible even\nto enumerate these perfections, given that, as he tells us, their\narchetypes number 124,000, in keeping with the number of prophets from\nthe time of Adam.\n",
