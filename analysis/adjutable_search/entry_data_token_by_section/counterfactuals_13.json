    "main_text": "Semantic Theories of Counterfactual Dependence\n3. Semantic Theories of Counterfactual Dependence\n\nSimilarity and strict analyses nowhere refer to facts, or\npropositions, depending on each\nother. Indeed, 1979 was primarily\nconcerned with explaining which true counterfactuals, given a\nsimilarity analysis, manifest a relation of counterfactual\ndependence. Other analyses have instead started with the idea that\nfacts depend on each other, and then explain how these relations of\ndependence make counterfactuals true. As will become clear, none of\nthese analyses endorse the naive idea that \\(\\mathsf{A > B}\\) is\ntrue only when B counterfactually depends on A. The\ndependence can be more complex, indirect, or B could just be\ntrue and independent of A. Theories in this family differ\ncrucially in how they model counterfactual dependence. In premise\nsemantics (\u00a73.1) dependence is modeled in\nterms of how facts, which are modeled as parts of worlds, are\ndistributed across a space of worlds that has been constrained by\nlaws, or law-like generalizations. In probabilistic semantics\n(\u00a73.2), this dependence is modeled as\nsome form of conditional probability. In Bayesian networks, structural\nequations, and causal models\n(\u00a73.3), it is modeled in\nterms of the Bayesian networks discussed at the beginning\nof \u00a71.2.3. Because theories of\nthese three kinds are very much still in development and often involve\neven more sophisticated formal models than those covered\nin \u00a72, this section will have to be more\ncursory than \u00a72 to ensure breadth and\naccessibility.\n",
