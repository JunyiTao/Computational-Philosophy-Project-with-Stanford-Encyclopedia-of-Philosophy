    "main_text": "\n\nEnvironmental aesthetics is a relatively new sub-field of\nphilosophical aesthetics. It arose within analytic aesthetics in the\nlast third of the twentieth century. Prior to its emergence,\naesthetics within the analytic tradition was largely concerned with\nphilosophy of art. Environmental aesthetics originated as a reaction\nto this emphasis, pursuing instead the investigation of the aesthetic\nappreciation of natural environments. Since its early stages, the\nscope of environmental aesthetics has broadened to include not simply\nnatural environments but also human and human-influenced ones. At the\nsame time, the discipline has also come to include the examination of\nthat which falls within such environments, giving rise to what is\ncalled the aesthetics of everyday life. This area involves the\naesthetics of not only more common objects and environments, but also\na range of everyday activities. Thus, early in the twenty-first\ncentury, environmental aesthetics embraced the study of the aesthetic\nsignificance of almost everything other than art. Together with this\nbroader scope of environmental aesthetics, the twenty-first century\nhas also given rise to renewed and more intense investigations of the\nrelationship between environmental aesthetics and environmentalism as\nwell as to several new interests and directions. \n",
