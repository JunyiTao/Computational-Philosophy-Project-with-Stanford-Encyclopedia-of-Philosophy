    "preamble": "\n\nRussellian monism is a theory in the metaphysics of mind, on which a\nsingle set of properties underlies both consciousness and the most\nbasic entities posited by physics. The theory is named for Bertrand\nRussell, whose views about consciousness and its place in nature were\ninformed by a structuralist conception of theoretical physics. On such\na structuralist conception, physics describes the world in terms of\nits spatiotemporal structure and dynamics (changes within that\nstructure) and says nothing about what, if anything, underlies that\nstructure and dynamics. For example, as it is sometimes put, physics\ndescribes what mass and charge do, e.g., how they dispose\nobjects to move toward or away from each other, but not what mass and\ncharge are. Thus, Russell writes the following about the\nevents physics describes:\n\n\nAll that physics gives us is certain equations giving abstract\nproperties of their changes. But as to what it is that changes, and\nwhat it changes from and to\u2014as to this, physics is silent.\n(Russell 1959: 18)\n\n\nRussellian monism can be seen as breaking that silence. It posits\nproperties that underlie the structure and dynamics that physics\ndescribes.

    "main_text": "\n1. The Content of Russellian Monism\n1.1 Three Core Russellian Monist Theses\n\nRussellian monism can be seen as combining three core theses:\nstructuralism about physics, which states roughly that\nphysics, at least current physics (see section 4.1), describes the\nworld only in terms of its spatiotemporal structure and dynamics;\nrealism about quiddities, which states that there are\nquiddities, that is, properties that underlie the structure\nand dynamics physics describes; and quidditism about\nconsciousness, which states that quiddities are relevant to\nconsciousness. We will discuss these theses in turn.\n\nTo understand the first core thesis, structuralism about physics,\nconsider David J. Chalmers\u2019s description of how physical theory\ncharacterizes its basic entities:\n\n\n\u2026physical theory only characterizes its basic entities\nrelationally, in terms of their causal and other relations to\nother entities. Basic particles, for instance, are largely\ncharacterized in terms of their propensity to interact with other\nparticles. Their mass and charge is specified, to be sure, but all\nthat a specification of mass ultimately comes to is a propensity to be\naccelerated by certain forces, and so on. Each entity is characterized\nby its relation to other entities, and so on forever. \u2026The\npicture of the physical world that this yields is that of a giant\ncausal flux, but the picture tells us nothing about what all this\ncausation relates. Reference to the proton is fixed as the\nthing that causes interactions of a certain kind, that combines in\ncertain ways with other entities, and so on; but what is the thing\nthat is doing the causing and combining? As Russell (1927a) notes,\nthis is a matter about which physical theory is silent. (Chalmers\n1996: 153)\n\n\nChalmers\u2019s description expresses structuralism about physics\nvividly. But his claim that physical theory characterizes its basic\nentities only relationally could be challenged. Shape is usually\ncounted among an object\u2019s non-relational properties (Stoljar\n2015). For example, contrast a ball\u2019s sphericality, a\nnon-relational property, with its tendency to roll when pushed, a\nrelational property. So, if physical theory characterizes its basic\nentities partly in terms of their shapes, then Chalmers\u2019s claim\nmight seem doubtful.\n\nSuch considerations need not be taken to indicate that structuralism\nabout physics is false. But they do seem to indicate that the relevant\ndistinction between structural and non-structural properties\u2014the\none relevant to structuralism about physics\u2014does not align with,\nand thus should not be explicated in terms of, the\nrelational/non-relational distinction. (Henceforth we omit mention of\ndynamics because the relevant issues concern structure.)\n\nStructuralism about physics is sometimes formulated in terms of the\ndistinction between extrinsic and intrinsic properties (Chalmers 1996:\n153\u2013155; see the entry\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties).\n But those formulations have been challenged on similar grounds: a\nball\u2019s sphericality is usually counted among its intrinsic\nproperties, as are other properties in terms of which physical theory\ncharacterizes its basic entities (Ney 2015; Stoljar 2015). (We will\nhenceforth use \u2018extrinsic\u2019 and \u2018relational\u2019\ninterchangeably, and likewise for \u2018intrinsic\u2019 and\n\u2018non-relational\u2019.) It might therefore be preferable to\nexplicate the structural/non-structural distinction in a different\nway.\n\nOne approach is to do so by distinguishing between relatively\nand absolutely intrinsic properties (Pereboom 2011:\n92\u201397, 2014, 2015, 2016; for an alternative explication, see\nChalmers 2010: 20, fn. 17; 2013: 256; cf. Alter 2016: 804\u201309).\nRoughly, relatively intrinsic properties are intrinsic properties that\nare nothing over and above extrinsic properties, whereas absolutely\nintrinsic properties are intrinsic properties that are not relatively\nintrinsic. (The relative/absolute intrinsicness distinction derives\nfrom Leibniz and Kant; see Leibniz to De Volder April 1702 [Leibniz G\nII, 240; 1969: 526\u2013527]; Kant 1781/1787: A277/B333; Pereboom\n1985: 413\u201323; 1991b; Van Cleve 1988; Langton 1998.)\n\nWe can articulate that distinction more precisely in terms of\nmetaphysical grounding (or, on some conceptions, constitution; see the\nentries\n metaphysical grounding\n and\n material constitution)\n where A grounds (or constitutes)\nB just in case A metaphysically necessitates\nB and B exists in virtue of A, as follows\n(Pereboom 2016):\n\n\nP is a relatively intrinsic property of X\njust in case P is an intrinsic property of X and\nP is grounded in extrinsic properties of either X or\nparts of X.\n\n\nBy contrast,\n\n\nP is an absolutely intrinsic property of X\njust in case P is an intrinsic property of X and\nP is not grounded in extrinsic properties of either\nX or parts of X.\n\n\nThus, for example, it seems plausible that a ball\u2019s sphericality\nis grounded in spatiotemporal relations among its parts (as Leibniz\nargued; Leibniz to De Volder April 1702 [G II, 240; 1969:\n526\u2013527]; see\n section 2.1\n below) and is therefore merely relatively intrinsic. A similar point\napplies to other intrinsic properties described in physics. For\nexample, although mass would seem to be an intrinsic property of\nmaterial entities, in the passage quoted above Chalmers remarks that\nin physical theory, \u201call that a specification of mass ultimately\ncomes to is a propensity to be accelerated by certain forces, and so\non\u201d (Chalmers 1996: 153). Accordingly, the only aspects of mass\nthat physical theory describes are relatively, not absolutely,\nintrinsic.\n\nSuppose structuralism about physics is explicated such that structural\nproperties are construed as extrinsic properties or relatively\nintrinsic properties. In that case, the thesis is consistent with the\nclaim that physical theory characterizes its basic entities partly in\nterms of its intrinsic properties, as long as those intrinsic\nproperties are relatively and not absolutely intrinsic. (For further\ndiscussion of structuralism about physics, see\n section 4.1\n below; and the entries\n structuralism in physics\n and\n structural realism.)\n\nThe second core Russellian monist thesis, realism about quiddities,\nstates that there are (instantiated) properties of precisely the sort\nabout which, according to structuralism about physics, physical theory\nis silent: properties that underlie the spatiotemporal structure\nphysical theory describes. Those properties categorically ground the\nmost basic physical dispositions that physics describes, in the way a\nball\u2019s spherical shape categorically grounds its disposition to\nroll when pushed. These underlying properties are often called\nquiddities (Lewis 2009; Chalmers 2012). They are also called\ninscrutables (Montero 2010). The latter designation is meant\nto indicate something on which many proponents of realism about\nquiddities agree: we know little about quiddities beyond the\ntheoretical roles they are supposed to play.\n\nOne might reject realism about quiddities even if one accepts\nstructuralism about physics. As Chalmers (2013: 254) writes,\n\u201cThere are respectable structuralist or dispostionalist views of\nphysics on which physics involves just structure or dispositions all\nthe way down\u201d (e.g., Ladyman and Ross, with Spurrett and Collier\n2007; Ney 2015; cf. Shoemaker 1980; Hawthorne 2001; McKitrick 2003).\nBut Russellian monists and others (e.g., Lewis 2009) regard such\nstructuralist or dispositionalist views as implausible. That is\nbecause such views \u201cseem to yield a world devoid of substance or\nqualities\u201d (Chalmers 2013 [2015: 254]). A world devoid of\nsubstance or qualities might or might not be possible. But according\nto realism about quiddities, the actual world is not like that.\n\nThe third core Russellian monist thesis, quidditism about\nconsciousness, states that quiddities are relevant to consciousness.\nMore specifically, it states that quiddities are relevant to\nphenomenal consciousness. For example, consider the feeling\none has when suffering from a painful migraine or when seeing a\nbrilliantly red sunset. As it is often put, there is something it\nis like to have a phenomenally conscious experience (Nagel 1974;\nsee the entry\n consciousness;\n throughout, all references to consciousness refer to phenomenal\nconsciousness). There is no consensus among Russellian monists on\nexactly how quiddities are relevant to consciousness\n (section 4).\n But many claim that phenomenal properties are constituted by\nquiddities, or by quiddities together with various structural\nproperties.\n\nOne might reject quidditism about consciousness even if one accepts\nstructuralism about physics and realism about quiddities. For example,\none might combine the latter two theses with a dualist theory on which\nquiddities categorically ground the most basic physical dispositions\nphysics describes but are not relevant to consciousness (perhaps on\nthis theory consciousness is fundamental and not constituted by\nanything). By contrast, according to quidditism about consciousness,\nquiddities play both of those roles.\n\nOne could identify Russellian monism with the conjunction of all three\ncore theses, where each thesis could be explicated in different ways,\nresulting in different varieties of the theory. For present purposes,\nthat characterization will suffice (see below, sections 1.2 and 4; for\nan alternative characterization, see Pereboom 2011: 89; cf. Alter and\nNagasawa 2012: 71\u201372.)\n1.2 Varieties of Russellian Monism\n\nWhile all Russellian monists maintain that quiddities are relevant to\nconsciousness\n (section 1.1),\n some construe quiddities themselves as phenomenal properties (Maxwell\n1978; Lockwood 1989, 1992; Rosenberg 2004; Strawson 2003, 2006a,b;\nM\u00f8rch 2014; Goff 2015, 2017; cf. Unger 2005). The result is a\nvariety of Russellian monism known as Russellian panpsychism\n(Chalmers 2013 [2015: 246\u2013247]). Russellian panpsychism is so\ncalled due to the assumption that phenomenality is ubiquitous: it\noccurs everywhere the most basic physical dispositions do. But as a\nterminological matter, one might allow that a Russellian monist theory\ncounts as Russellian panpsychism if it specifies either that at\nleast some of the most basic physical dispositions are underlain\nby phenomenal quiddities (Chalmers 2013 [2015: 246]) or that\nall such dispositions are so underlain (Strawson\n2006a,b).)\n\nPanpsychism has a long philosophical history (see the entry\n panpsychism;\n Skrbina 2005), but some find the doctrine incredible (Searle 1997;\nbut see Chalmers 1997b; Alter and Nagasawa 2012: 90). Here it should\nbe noted that Russellian panpsychists typically do not construe\nquiddities as macrophenomenal properties, that is, as\nfamiliar phenomenal properties such as those commonly associated with\nfeeling pain and seeing red. More often, Russellian panpsychists\nconstrue quiddities as microphenomenal properties, that is,\nas phenomenal properties of microphysical entities. Microphenomenal\nproperties might differ radically from the macrophenomenal sort\n(Chalmers 1996: 293\u2013297; Strawson 2003, 2006a; Rosenberg 2004:\n95). Some Russellian panpsychists construe quiddities as\ncosmophenomenal properties, that is, phenomenal properties of\nthe whole cosmos, which might likewise differ radically from\nmacrophenomenal properties (Goff 2017). So, the sorts of phenomenal\nproperties that, according to Russellian panpsychism, underlie the\nmost basic physical dispositions need not be much like any with which\nwe are familiar. This might make panpsychism more palatable to some\nphilosophers\u2014though, some argue, if such properties differ\nenough from familiar macrophenomenal properties, one might doubt that\nthey deserve to be called phenomenal at all (Kind 2006).\n\nAnother option for Russellian monists is to construe quiddities as\nwhat Chalmers calls protophenomenal properties, which he\ncharacterizes as follows:\n\n\n\u2026protophenomenal properties are special properties\nthat are not phenomenal (there is nothing it is like to have a single\nprotophenomenal property) but that can collectively constitute\nphenomenal properties, perhaps when arranged in the right structure.\n(Chalmers 2013 [2015: 259])\n\n\nThe result is a variety of Russellian monism known as Russellian\npanprotopsychism. Russellian panprotopsychism does not entail\npanpsychism. Perhaps only entities in a limited class (e.g., some\nstates of some animals) have protophenomenal properties that are\narranged in a consciousness-constituting structure. In that case, on\nRussellian panprotopsychism consciousness would occur only in those\nentities and not elsewhere. There are also hybrid varieties of\nRussellian monism, on which some quiddities are phenomenal and others\nare protophenomenal (Holman 2008).\n\nRussellian monism is a distinctive theory in the metaphysics of mind.\nNevertheless, it is possible to identify varieties that correspond to\nmore traditional theories, including physicalism, idealism, neutral\nmonism, and (despite the name) even dualism (see the entries\n physicalism;\n idealism;\n neutral monism;\n and\n dualism).\n On physicalist Russellian monism, both quiddities and structural\nproperties are physical (Stoljar 2001; Pereboom 2011, 2014, 2015,\n2019; Coleman 2012, 2015; Montero 2015; Morris 2016; Brown 2017). On\nidealist Russellian monism, both quiddities and structural properties\nare mental (Bolender, 2001; Adams 2007; Schneider 2018; cf. Chalmers\n1996: 155). On neutral monist Russellian monism, both quiddities and\nstructural properties are neutral, where neutral properties are\nneither physical nor mental but underlie both physical and mental\nproperties (Nagel 1986, 1998; cf. Stoljar 2015; Wishon 2016; also see\nthe discussion of panqualityism in the entry\n panpsychism).\n Finally, Russellian monism could be combined with the traditional\n(e.g., Cartesian) dualist view that the concrete world includes two\nfundamentally distinct sorts of entities, the physical sort and the\nmental sort. This can be done by, for example, identifying structural\nproperties with physical properties and quiddities with certain mental\nproperties (cf. Chalmers 2010: 135).\n\nPhysicalist and neutral monist varieties of Russellian monism are most\nnaturally understood as forms of Russellian panprotopsychism (Alter\nand Coleman 2020b; but see Morris 2016, Brown 2017), whereas idealist\nand dualist varieties are most naturally understood as forms of\nRussellian panpsychism (Chalmers 2013, Schneider 2018). Much of the\nrecent literature on Russellian monism focuses on the physicalist\nvariety, often called Russellian physicalism (Montero 2015).\nRussellian physicalism is usually presented as an alternative to,\nrather than a version of, traditional physicalism. But that might seem\nmisleading. On many traditional physicalist theories, there are\nnon-phenomenal properties that can collectively constitute phenomenal\nproperties, perhaps when arranged in the right\nstructure\u2014microphysical properties, say. On those theories, such\nproperties would qualify as protophenomenal properties by the\ncharacterization quoted above from Chalmers 2013 (Papineau 2002:\n22\u201323, fn. 5).\n\nSome traditional physicalist theories conflict with other aspects of\nRussellian monism. For example, (physicalist) analytic functionalism\n(Armstrong 1968; Lewis 1966, 1972, 1980) conflicts with the Russellian\nmonist\u2019s denial that structural truths alone a priori\nentail all phenomenal truths (see the entry\n functionalism;\n phenomenal truths are truths about consciousness). But other\ntraditional physicalist theories are not similarly disqualified. For\nexample, a posteriori physicalists also deny that structural\ntruths alone a priori entail all phenomenal truths (see the\nentry\n physicalism).\n Nevertheless, in their view, there are non-phenomenal properties that\ncan collectively constitute phenomenal properties, perhaps when\narranged in the right structure. So, one might wonder why a\nposteriori physicalism does not qualify as Russellian\nphysicalism.\n\nChalmers recognizes this problem. He therefore makes two further\nstipulations designed to help distinguish Russellian physicalism from\ntraditional physicalist theories:\n\n\n\u2026(i) protophenomenal properties are distinct from structural\nproperties and (ii) there is an a priori entailment from\ntruths about protophenomenal properties (perhaps along with structural\nproperties) to truths about the phenomenal properties that they\nconstitute. (Chalmers 2013 [2015: 260])\n\n\nGiven those further stipulations, a posteriori physicalists\nwould deny that there are protophenomenal properties. Similar\nconsiderations apply to other traditional physicalist theories.\nRussellian physicalism is different. (For other ways to distinguish\namong varieties of Russellian monism, see\n section 4;\n Alter and Nagasawa 2012; Chalmers 2013; Goff 2017.)\n2. Russellian Monism in the History of Western Philosophy\n2.1 Russellian Monism in the Seventeenth through Nineteenth Centuries\n\nOne could find views that resemble Russellian monism in certain\nrespects throughout the history of philosophy. For example,\npanpsychism is very old indeed (and not distinctive to the west). But\nit is hard to find views approximating full-fledged Russellian monism\nbefore the early modern period. This is not a coincidence: the theory\nis closely tied to modern physics, which was first developed during\nthat era. Yet it did not take long for the theory, or something akin\nto it, to emerge. Arguably, Russellian monism can be ascribed to\nvarious early modern figures, including at least Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz, Immanuel Kant, and Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Russellian monist theory may be found in his critique\nof Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 theory of matter (Pereboom 2011:\n92\u201397; cf. 1991a,b). In Descartes\u2019 theory, material\nsubstance is essentially just extension in three spatial dimensions\n(Descartes Principia Philosophi\u00e6, \u201cPart Two: The\nPrinciples of Material Things\u201d 1644 [1984: v. 1, 223\u2013247;\nAT VIII 40\u201379]; see the entry\n Descartes\u2019 physics).\n Leibniz contends that Descartes\u2019 theory is unsatisfactory\nbecause, first, the extension of a physical object is (in the\nterminology introduced in\n section 1.1,\n which is Kantian (Kant 1781/1787: A277/B333)) a relatively intrinsic\nproperty of it, since it resolves into the plurality, spatial\ncontinuity, and temporal coexistence of its parts, and the extension\nof those parts resolves into those extrinsic properties of their\nparts, ad infinitum; and, second, any real thing, that is,\nany actual, concrete entity, cannot possess only extrinsic or\nrelatively intrinsic properties: it must possess an absolutely\nintrinsic property as well. Leibniz writes: \u201cthere is no\ndenomination so extrinsic that it does not have an intrinsic\ndenomination at its basis\u201d (Leibniz to De Volder April 1702\n[Leibniz G II, 240; 1969: 526\u2013527]). In his view, a conception\nof the physical world that does not include absolutely intrinsic\nproperties is in an important sense incomplete. In effect, his\ncomplaint is that Descartes\u2019 theory of matter describes only\nstructure without describing a quiddistic ground for that structure,\nor even acknowledging the possibility of or the need for such a\nground.\n\nIn Leibniz\u2019s view, the absolutely intrinsic properties\nunderlying real things are at least connected to primitive\nforce (see the entry\n Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of physics).\n Primitive force (which can appear to us phenomenally as physical\nforce) generates a progression from one representation to the next in\na series, in conformity with a law (Leibniz 1698 [1969: 504; 1989:\n162\u201363]; Adams 1994: 352; Jorati 2018). On one interpretation,\nprimitive forces are the fundamental elements, \u201cthe sole\ninhabitants of the ground floor\u201d of Leibniz\u2019s ontology\n(Jorati 2018); thus, the most basic substances, mind-like monads,\n\u201cdo not have forces, strictly speaking\u2014they are\nforces\u201d (Jorati 2018; cf. Adams 1994: 265, 378\u2013379). On\nthat reading, primitive forces are the absolutely intrinsic\nproperties underlying real things. They might be called Leibnizian\nquiddities.\n\nLeibniz might be the first Russellian monist. In his view, all the\nproperties physics presents are either extrinsic or relatively\nintrinsic. This corresponds to structuralism about physics. He\ncontends there are absolutely intrinsic properties, primitive forces\non one reading, in which those extrinsic properties and relatively\nintrinsic properties are grounded. This corresponds to realism about\nquiddities. Those quiddities ground all of the other features of\nreality, including consciousness generally and macrophenomenal\nproperties specifically. This corresponds to quidditism about\nconsciousness. Thus, Leibniz seems to endorse versions of all three\ncore Russellian monist theses. And because on his view all basic\nentities, including Leibnizian quiddities and the extrinsic and\nrelatively intrinsic properties they ground, are mental, Leibnizian\nRussellian monism is a version of Russellian idealism.\n\nLike Leibniz, Kant can be seen as a Russellian monist. Kant endorses a\nversion of structuralism about physics: \u201cAll that we cognize in\nmatter are nothing but relations. What we call the intrinsic\ndeterminations of it are intrinsic only in a relative\nsense\u2026\u201d (1781/1787: A285/B341; Pereboom 1985:\n413\u201323, 1991a,b, 2011: 100\u2013101; Van Cleve 1988; Langton\n1998; cf. Holden 2004: 236\u2013263). In material objects we discover\nonly extrinsic properties and relatively intrinsic properties, never\nany properties that are absolutely intrinsic. Indeed, for Kant, matter\nitself does not have absolutely intrinsic properties. That is because\nhe regards matter as \u201cmere appearance\u201d. Thus, he writes,\n\u201cwhat it [matter] itself consists in is the mere relation of\nsomething in general to the senses\u201d (1781/1787: A285/B341). If\nmatter were instead a \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d, he implies, then\nit would need to have absolutely intrinsic properties. Nevertheless,\nin his view all features of appearance, including both matter and\nmacrophenomenal consciousness, are grounded in things-in-themselves\n(or a thing-in-itself) and thus in absolutely intrinsic\nproperties\u2014a position that suggests both realism about\nquiddities and quidditism about consciousness.\n\nAlthough Kant agrees with Leibniz that there must be absolutely\nintrinsic properties for the world to exist as we know it, he differs\nwith Leibniz about forces. In Kant\u2019s view, forces are relational\nand thus not absolutely intrinsic (1781/1787: A265/B321; 1786:\n498\u2013491). He does not say whether there are Leibnizian primitive\nforces. And he denies that we know much about the nature of the\nabsolutely intrinsic properties that, he thinks, must exist. Such\nknowledge would be tantamount to substantive knowledge of\nthings-in-themselves, and famously he contends that we lack such\nknowledge. He could therefore be described as endorsing an\nepistemological doctrine that many contemporary Russellian monists\nendorse\n (section 1.1):\n we know little about quiddities beyond the theoretical roles they are\nsupposed to play.\n\nSchopenhauer can be seen as another pre-twentieth century Russellian\nmonist. In The World as Will and Representation, he affirms\nwhat might be described as versions of structuralism about physics and\nrealism about quiddities. Natural causal explanation, he writes,\n\n\n\u2026really does nothing more than indicate the orderly arrangement\naccording to which the states of matter appear in space and\ntime\u2026 But it affords us absolutely no information about the\nintrinsic nature (das innere Wesen) of any one of these\nphenomena. (1818: Vol. 1, Bk. II, sect. 17, par. 5 [1961: 113])\n\n\nAnd he implies that those phenomena do indeed have intrinsic natures,\nwhich suggests quidditism about consciousness.\n\nSo far, Schopenhauer\u2019s view is similar to Kant\u2019s. But\nSchopenhauer does something Kant would not do. He makes a further\npositive proposal about the nature of the absolutely intrinsic\nproperties that underlie the orderly arrangement indicated by natural\ncausal explanations. Specifically, in his view the will plays\nthe key role: \u201cindeed the answer to the riddle is given to the\nsubject of knowledge who appears as an individual, and the answer is\nwill\u201d (1818: Vol. 1, Bk. II, sect. 18, par. 1 [1961: 115]). The\nabsolutely intrinsic properties in which the orderly arrangement of\nthe world of appearance is grounded are volitional\u2014and hence the\ntitle of his famous book The World as Will and Representation\n(Schopenhauer 1818: Vol. 1, Bk. II, sect. 18, par. 1 [1961: 115]; see\nthe entry\n Arthur Schopenhauer).\n\nSome find Russellian monism in works by others in the modern period as\nwell. Rebecca Copenhaver (2020) argues that George Berkeley can be\nseen as a Russellian idealist. Cole Mitchell (in correspondence)\nreports that there is a version of Russellian panprotopsychism\ndiscussed by Anthony Collins, in the 1707\u201308 Clarke-Collins\nCorrespondence.\n2.2 Russellian Monism in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n\nContemporary Russellian monists often trace their view to\nRussell\u2019s 1927 The Analysis of Matter, which they read\nas developing a structuralist account of physics. Indeed, some find in\nthat book suggestions of not only structuralism about physics but the\nother main components of Russellian monism too (Lockwood 1992 [2015:\n144\u2013145]; Chalmers 1996: 166). On this interpretation, Russell\nthere implied that what are now called quiddities might be identified\nwith what he called percepts (Russell 1927a: 402). It has\nalso been argued that he more explicitly endorsed the eponymous theory\n(though not by its current name) in some of his later writings,\nincluding Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits and My\nPhilosophical Development (Wishon 2015; but see Stubenberg\n2015).\n\nSome argue that Russellian monism has historical roots not only in\nRussell\u2019s writings but also in early twentieth century works by\nArthur Eddington (Kadi\u0107 2017; cf. Strawson 2006a). In\nEddington\u2019s view, science does not describe what he calls the\nnature of the entities it posits, which he also refers to as\nthe background of \u201cpointer readings and similar\nindications\u201d (Eddington 1928: 252). For instance, he contends,\nphysics\u2014modern physics, as opposed to the physics of the\n\u201cVictorian physicist\u201d for whom \u201cAtoms were tiny\nbilliard balls\u2026\u201d\u2014describes atoms not in terms of\ntheir natures but rather in terms of pointer readings (Eddington 1928:\n259). Thus, like Russell, Eddington seems to affirm a version of\nstructuralism about physics (or something in the vicinity). Further,\nEddington proposes that atoms, and perhaps everything else physics\ndescribes, might have \u201csomething of spiritual nature of which a\nprominent characteristic is thought\u201d (Eddington 1928:\n259). In support of that proposal, he writes,\n\n\nBut in one case\u2014namely, for the pointer readings of my own\nbrain\u2014I have an insight which is not limited to the evidence of\nthe pointer readings. That insight shows that they are attached to a\nbackground of consciousness. Although I may expect that the background\nof other pointer readings in physics is of a nature continuous with\nthat revealed to me in this particular case, I do not suppose that it\nalways has the more specialized attributes of consciousness.\n(Eddington 1928: 259\u2013260)\n\n\nEddington\u2019s reflections can be seen as suggestive of either\nRussellian panpsychism (Kadi\u0107 2017: 46), Russellian\npanprotopsychism, or perhaps a hybrid of the two.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, Grover Maxwell (1978) and Michael\nLockwood (1989, 1992) each endorse a theory that they attribute to\nRussell and is often interpreted as Russellian monism (see, for\nexample, Chalmers 1996, 2013). Maxwell presents his theory in the\ncourse of defending the mind-brain identity theory (Place 1956; Smart\n1959; Lewis 1966; see the entry\n the mind/brain identity theory)\n against Saul Kripke\u2019s (1972) influential challenge.\nKripke\u2019s challenge concerns how to reconcile that identity\ntheory with the \u201capparent contingency of the connection between\nthe mental state and the corresponding brain state\u2026\u201d\n(Kripke 1972 [1980: 152]). Maxwell rejects an assumption on which, he\nclaims, that challenge relies: the assumption that \u201cwe know from\ncommon sense, from physics, from neurophysiology, etc., what brain\nevents are like\u201d (Maxwell 1978: 134). In his view, those sources\ntell us about structural properties but not about brain events\u2019\nunderlying non-structural properties\u2014a line of reasoning\nsuggestive of both structuralism about physics and realism about\nquiddities. He also seems to endorse something like quidditism about\nconsciousness. In the case of brain events that are, in his view,\nidentical to macrophenomenal experiences, he implies that their\nunderlying non-structural properties might be phenomenal\nproperties\u2014a claim suggestive of Russellian panpsychism.\nLockwood (1989, 1992) develops a theory similar to Maxwell\u2019s,\nremarking that it \u201cseems to me the only approach to the\nphilosophical mind\u2013body problem, currently on offer, that holds\nout the slightest promise\u201d (Lockwood 1992 [2015: 145]).\n\nMore recent discussions of Russellian monism have followed Maxwell and\nLockwood\u2019s lead. The view is advanced as offering a plausible\nresponse not only to Kripke\u2019s challenge but also to related\nanti-materialist arguments\n (section 3).\n Daniel Stoljar\u2019s \u201cTwo Conceptions of the Physical\u201d\n(2001) is widely considered the classic expression of that idea (see\nalso Stoljar 2006, 2009, 2014, 2015). The idea is also developed by\nChalmers (1996, 1997a, 2003, 2010: ch. 6, 10) and others (Rosenberg\n2004; Alter 2009, 2016; Montero 2010, 2015; Pereboom 2011, 2014, 2015,\n2016; McClelland 2013; Brown 2017; Goff 2017). Chalmers (1997a)\nintroduced the name \u201cRussellian monism,\u201d and his work on\nthe topic has been highly influential. Another main source of the\ncontemporary interest in Russellian monism is Galen Strawson\u2019s\n(2003, 2006a,b) seminal work on consciousness and physicalism.\n\n3. Arguments for and Objections to Russellian Monism\n3.1 Arguments for Russellian Monism\n\nRussellian monists usually support their theory by arguing that it has\nsignificant theoretical benefits. We will describe three such\narguments, which appeal to closely related considerations. (For other\narguments for Russellian monism see, for example, Rosenberg 2004;\nStrawson 2006a; Goff 2017; Schneider 2018.)\n\nThe first argument is based on the claim that Russellian monism\ncombines theoretical virtues of traditional dualism with those of\ntraditional physicalism, while avoiding their main drawbacks (Chalmers\n2013). The reasoning behind that claim could be stated as follows.\nTraditional physicalism has the virtue of allowing consciousness to be\nintegrated into physical causation. But this comes at the cost of\ndisregarding or distorting the distinctive features of consciousness.\nTraditional dualism avoids that cost. But by separating consciousness\nfrom the physical world, traditional dualism prevents consciousness\nfrom being integrated into physical causation. The latter cost is\nfamously articulated by Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, in her\ncriticism of Cartesian dualism (Elisabeth to Descartes, 21 May, 1643\n[1984: v. 3, 218; AT III 665]; see the entry\n Elisabeth, Princess of Bohemia),\n and by related causal arguments for physicalism such as the\nfollowing:\n\n\nMany effects that we attribute to conscious causes have full physical\ncauses. But it would be absurd to suppose that these effects are\ncaused twice over. So the conscious causes must be identical to some\npart of those physical causes. (Papineau 2002: 17; cf. Kim 1989,\n1998).\n\n\nBy contrast, Russellian monism seems to avoid those costs of both\ntraditional physicalism and traditional dualism. On Russellian monism,\nthe properties that constitute consciousness\u2014quiddities and\n(perhaps) structural properties\u2014play indispensable roles in\nphysical causation. Consciousness \u2014or at least the components of\nconsciousness \u2014is thus integrated into physical causation. Yet\nthe distinctive features of consciousness are neither disregarded nor\ndistorted. Those features are attributed to quiddities and their\nspecial (e.g., constitutive) relationship to consciousness.\n\nA second argument for Russellian monism is based on the claim that\nthis theory offers an elegant, unified solution to two distinct\nphilosophical problems (Lockwood 1989, 1992; Chalmers 1996, 2013\n[2015: 254]; Rosenberg 2004; Goff 2017; cf. Russell 1927a, 1927b:\n116). One of those problems is how to provide a foundation for the\nspatiotemporal structure physics describes. The other is how to\nintegrate consciousness into physical causation. When considered from\nthe perspective of a Russellian monist, these two problems seem made\nfor each other. The requisite foundation of spatiotemporal structure\nis provided by (proto)phenomenal quiddities. Because those same\nquiddities (partly or wholly) constitute consciousness, consciousness\nthereby plays a distinctive role in physical causation\u2014or at\nleast the components of consciousness play that role. Thus, the\nreasoning runs, both problems are solved at once.\n\nA third argument for Russellian monism is based on the claim that\nRussellian monism provides a plausible response to anti-materialist\narguments such as the conceivability argument and the knowledge\nargument (see the entries\n zombies\n and\n qualia: the knowledge argument\n and Alter 2023). The conceivability argument is often formulated in\nterms of a zombie world (Chalmers 1996): a physical and\nfunctional duplicate of the actual world but without consciousness. It\nis first argued that a zombie world is ideally conceivable, which\nmeans roughly that such a world cannot be ruled out as incoherent by\na priori reasoning (Chalmers 2002). It is then argued that\nthe ideal conceivability of such a world entails its metaphysical\npossibility. Finally, it is argued that the metaphysical possibility\nof such a world entails that physicalism is false. The knowledge\nargument begins with Frank Jackson\u2019s (1982, 1986, 1995) case of\nMary, the brilliant scientist in the black-and-white room, who comes\nto know the complete physical truth by reading black-and-white science\nbooks and watching science lectures on a black-and-white monitor. If\nphysicalism were true, Jackson reasons, then Mary would thereby know\neverything there is to know about seeing in color: she could deduce\nthat information from her physical knowledge. But, he claims, this is\nnot the case. On the contrary, when Mary leaves the room she learns\ntruths about what it is like to see in color \u2013 truths she did\nnot already know.\n\nAccording to Russellian monism, those arguments might show that\nstructure alone does not fully determine (metaphysically necessitate)\nthe nature or even the existence of consciousness. But it does not\nfollow that physicalism is false. At most, it follows that\ntraditional physicalist theories are false, because those\ntheories limit the physicalist\u2019s resources to the structural.\nRussellian physicalism, on which the class of physical truths\nincludes not only structural truths but quiddistic truths as well, is\nnot threatened (Stoljar 2001). Further, this anti-structuralist thesis\ncomports well with the claim that consciousness consists at least\npartly in non-structural quiddities\u2014a claim that is central to\nRussellian monism generally, not just the physicalist variety\n (section 1).\n\nThat response can be developed in different ways, such as rejecting\nepistemic premises on which the anti-materialist arguments rely (for\nother ways, see Chalmers 2010: 134\u2013135; Pereboom 2011; Alter and\nNagasawa 2012: 83\u201386). Regarding the conceivability argument,\nRussellian physicalists can argue as follows. On reflection, a zombie\nworld is not ideally conceivable. If such a world initially appears\nconceivable, this is because we mistake a zombie world for a\nstructural zombie world: a consciousness-free world that\n(minimally) duplicates all of the actual world\u2019s structural\nfeatures. If there is an ideally conceivable world in the vicinity,\nthen that world is a structural zombie world. There is no good reason\nto accept the ideal conceivability of a full-fledged zombie world,\nwhich would lack consciousness despite duplicating not only the actual\nworld\u2019s structural features but its quiddistic features as well.\nRegarding the knowledge argument, Russellian physicalists can argue\nthat because Mary\u2019s black-and-white science lessons leave out\nquiddistic information, those lessons teach her only part of the\nphysical truth. If so, then the truths she learns when she leaves\nmight be physical. They would be non-structural quiddistic truths but\nphysical truths nonetheless.\n3.2 Objections to Russellian Monism\n\nOne objection to Russellian monism concerns the combination\nproblem: how do (proto)phenomenal quiddities (or quiddities and\nstructural properties) combine to constitute macrophenomenal\nproperties (Seager 1995; Chalmers 2003)? Suppose someone is having a\nphenomenally blue experience. If constitutive Russellian\nmonism is true, then the phenomenal blueness of that experience\nconsists wholly in certain quiddities, perhaps structured in a certain\nway (for the distinction between constitutive and non-constitutive\nRussellian monism, see Section 4.2). But on many varieties of\nRussellian monism, quiddities are micro-level features. On the face of\nit, it seems possible that those (or any) micro-level quiddities could\nbe instantiated without anyone having that (or any)\nexperience\u2014and that seems possible no matter how they are\nstructured. If that is possible, then how could phenomenal blueness\nconsist wholly in (structured) quiddities, as constitutive Russellian\nmonists hold? Essentially the same problem seems to arise for other\nvarieties of constitutive Russellian monism, such as those on which\nquiddities are construed as cosmophenomenal features (Goff 2009;\nPereboom 2011, 114; Chalmers 2013, 2017).\n\nThat is one version of the combination problem, but there are others.\nConsider one raised for a version of constitutive Russellian\npanspsychism, according to which microphenomenal quiddities, perhaps\ntogether with structural properties, combine to constitute\nmacrophenomenal properties. The problem can be stated as an objection,\nas follows. The constitutive Russellian panpsychist is committed to\nthe following two claims. First, corresponding to each instance of a\nmicrophenomenal quiddity underlying a physical disposition there is a\nunique conscious subject: a microsubject distinct from the\nmicrosubjects that correspond to other such instances of\nmicrophenomenal quiddities. Second, multiple microsubjects\ncorresponding to microphenomenal quiddities combine to constitute a\nsingle macrosubject. But it is unclear how that second claim could be\ntrue. As William James (1890: 162) suggests, given any group of\nsubjects and any further subject, it seems possible for the group to\nexist without that further subject existing. This is known the\nsubject-summing problem (Goff 2009, 2017; Chalmers 2013, 2017;\nColeman 2014).\n\nSome respond to such combination problems by appealing to a Leibnizian\nunderrepresentation thesis (Pereboom 2011: 114\u2013115), on which\nintrospective awareness of phenomenal states fails to represent them\nas having microfeatures they do in fact have (Leibniz, Discourse\non Metaphysics, \u00a730 [G IV, 458\u201359; IV, 574\u2013575];\nPereboom 1991b, 2011: 9, n. 1; cf. Stoljar 2001: 276). Consider the\nversion of the combination problem stated two paragraphs back,\ninvolving the constitution of phenomenal blueness. On the Leibnizian\nunderrepresentation thesis, even if one introspects one\u2019s\nexperience as featuring only noncomplex phenomenal blueness,\nphenomenal blueness might in fact be constituted by an unrepresented\narray of (proto)phenomenal quiddities. To support that claim, one\nmight draw an analogy to a macrophenomenal property that is\nconstituted by other macrophenomenal properties. For example,\na taste experience might appear simple and unconstituted even if in\nfact it is constituted by a combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter,\nand umami (as Louis DeRosset has suggested in conversation; see\nPereboom 2011: 115). Likewise, the response continues, perhaps all\nmacrophenomenal features are constituted by (proto)phenomenal\nquiddities, or by quiddities and structural features, which\nintrospection fails to reveal.\n\nHowever, that response is only partial. It might show that\nintrospection alone does not rule out the possibility that\nmacrophenomenal properties are constituted by quiddities or by\nquiddities and structure. But the response does not explain how\nmacrophenomenal properties might result from such constituents.\nAlthough some explanations have been proposed (e.g., Rosenberg 2004,\n2015, M\u00f8rch 2019), many regard the combination problem for\nRussellian monism as unsolved and serious (see the entry\n panpsychism;\n Br\u00fcntrup and Jaskolla 2017; Chalmers 2017).\n\nSeveral other objections to Russellian monism have been raised in the\nrecent literature, of which we will describe four. The first is\nrelated to the combination problem and applies only to Russellian\npanprotopsychism. It is argued that Russellian panprotopsychism faces\nthe following sort of \u201crevenge\u201d problem. Russellian monism\nis motivated partly by its ability to provide plausible responses to\ninfluential anti-physicalist arguments, such as the conceivability and\nknowledge arguments\n (section 3.1).\n Those arguments usually begin by attacking allegedly implausible\nepistemic commitments of certain traditional physicalist views (such\nas analytic functionalism), such as the claim that structural truths\nalone a priori entail all phenomenal truths. However, some\nargue, parallel considerations undermine the Russellian\npanprotopsychist\u2019s claim that protophenomenal truths and\nstructural truths together a priori entail all phenomenal\ntruths (Strawson 2006a,b; Goff 2015, 2017). Thus, for example, it is\nargued that while still in the black-and-white room Mary can come to\nknow all the protophenomenal truths just as easily as she can come to\nknow all the structural truths, and still not thereby be positioned to\nknow what it is like to see red (for related objections to Russellian\nmonism, see Cutter 2019, Botin 2023, and Mendelow forthcoming).\n\nIn response, some deny that the two a priori entailment\nclaims are on a par (Alter 2018). Mary could come to know any\nstructural truth while still in the room, the response runs, because\nany structural truth can be fully conveyed in the colorless language\nof objective science. But protophenomenal properties are\nnon-structural. So, perhaps some protophenomenal truths cannot be\nfully conveyed in such colorless language. If so, then the Russellian\npanprotopsychist\u2019s a priori entailment claim might not\nmeet the same fate as the one associated with certain traditional\nphysicalist theories.\n\nA second recent objection, developed by Amy Kind (2015), is that\nRussellian monism is unmotivated. The theory is often advanced as\nproviding insight into the mind\u2013body problem: insight that has\neluded traditional dualists and traditional physicalists\n (section 3.1).\n However, Kind points out, Russellian monism fails to resolve the most\ncentral issue in the debate: whether consciousness is a fundamental\ncomponent of the universe. On Russellian panpsychism consciousness is\na fundamental component of the universe, whereas on Russellian\npanprotopsychism it is not. Thus, Russellian monism leaves us\n\u201cessentially back where we started\u201d (Kind 2015: 420; cf.\nLiu 2021, which compares the view to Thomistic hylomorphism and claims\nthat Russellian monism has similar problems). In response, it has been\nargued that this charge misunderstands Russellian monism\u2019s aims\n(Alter and Coleman 2020a). Russellian monism does not purport to\nsettle whether consciousness is a fundamental component of the\nuniverse. Rather, the theory is meant to provide a framework in which\nthat issue (and others) can be more productively addressed\u2014a\nframework provided by neither traditional physicalism nor traditional\ndualism.\n\nA third recent objection is that Russellian monism, despite its aims,\nfails to adequately integrate consciousness into physical causation.\nOne version of this objection begins with the premise that, on\nRussellian monism, a single type of physical disposition might have\nbeen grounded by a distinct quiddity from the quiddity that actually\ngrounds it (Howell 2015; cf. Robinson 1993). For example, if in the\nactual world quiddity Q1 grounds negative charge, then there is a\nmetaphysically possible world in which a distinct quiddity Q2 grounds\nnegative charge; the grounding relationship between quiddities and\nphysical dispositions is in this way metaphysically contingent. If so,\nthe argument continues, then quiddities (even if they exist) do not\nmake any distinctive contribution to physical causation. With respect\nto physical causation, quiddities are \u201cjust along for the causal\nride\u201d (Howell 2015: 34). On another version of the objection,\neven if quiddities contribute to physical causation, consciousness\ndoes not thereby inherit any physical efficacy, contrary to what\nRussellian monists claim (Robinson 2018; cf. Chan 2020, 2021).\n\nIn response to the first version of that objection, on which\nquiddities lack physical efficacy, some reject the assumption that any\nsuch conclusion follows from the premise that a single type of\nphysical disposition might have been grounded by a distinct quiddity\nfrom the quiddity that actually grounds it (Hawthorne 2002, Alter and\nColeman 2020a, 2021). Causal relations, it is argued, do not in\ngenerally hold with metaphysical necessity. So, why must the\nrelationship between quiddities and dispositions hold with such\nnecessity, if quiddities are to be physically efficacious? Another\nresponse is to reject the premise that on Russellian monism that\nrelationship is metaphysically contingent (Chalmers 2013 [2015:\n264\u2013265]; M\u00f8rch 2014, 2019; Gundersen 2015; Kadi\u0107\n2017; Alter and Coleman 2020a, 2021). In response to the second\nversion of the objection, on which consciousness does not inherit any\nphysical efficacy from that of quiddities (even if quiddities partly\nor wholly constitute consciousness), one might argue that this charge\nis just an instance of a general worry concerning micro-to-macro\ncausal exclusion, which does not concern consciousness or Russellian\nmonism specifically. (See the entry\n mental causation;\n Goff 2017: 153\u2013158)\n\nA fourth recent objection to Russellian monism targets the distinction\nbetween the structural and the non-structural. Some argue that this\ndistinction cannot be explicated in the way that Russellian monism\nrequires. As noted above\n (section 1.1),\n some have made proposals for how to explicate that distinction. Those\nproposals render structuralism about physics consistent with the claim\nphysics describes some intrinsic properties, thus safeguarding\nstructuralism about physics from one line of attack. But whether any\nof those proposals is fully adequate for the purposes of Russellian\nmonism is disputed (Stoljar 2015). Other, related objections have been\nraised, e.g., that the dispositional/categorical distinction does not\napply to physical properties in the way that Russellian monism implies\n(Hiddleston 2019; but see Alter and Pereboom 2023; for other\nobjections concerning the Russellian monist\u2019s\nstructural/non-structural distinction, see Stoljar 2006, 2009, 2014,\n2015; Ney 2015; for responses, see Pereboom 2011, 2014, 2015; Alter\n2009, 2016).\n4. Further Issues\n4.1 Structuralism about Physics\n\nAs noted above\n (section 1.1),\n Russellian monism can be identified with the conjunction of the three\ntheses: structuralism about physics, realism about quiddities, and\nquidditism about consciousness. But one might question whether\nRussellian monists are committed to structuralism about physics, at\nleast if that thesis is understood as saying that physical theory is\ncompletely silent on the existence and nature of quiddities.\nGiven Russellian monism, terms for the basic entities in physical\ntheory, such as \u201cmass\u201d and \u201ccharge\u201d, perhaps\nrefer to quiddities, to entities that have quiddities. One\nmight take that point alone to belie the structuralist\u2019s\ncomplete-silence claim. Further, one might wonder, why should\nRussellian monists rule out the possibility of physical theory\nexpressing substantive information about the referents of its terms\n(Hawthorne 2002)?\n\nIn response, one might argue that physical theory itself is neutral\nbetween a Russellian monist interpretation according to which terms\nlike \u201cmass\u201d and \u201ccharge\u201d refer to quiddities,\nand a structuralist interpretation according to which such terms do\nnot refer to quiddities (Ladyman and Ross, with Spurrett and Collier\n2007). That is, one might argue that the commitments of physical\ntheory itself, by contrast with a metaphysical interpretation\nof physical theory, do not go beyond the structural.\nStructuralism about physics could thus be viewed as a thesis only\nabout physical theory itself. In that case, the considerations\nmentioned in the preceding paragraph do not challenge the claim that\nRussellian monists are committed to structuralism about physics.\n\nAlternatively, one might give up the claim that Russellian monists are\ncommitted to structuralism about physics (Alter and Pereboom 2023; but\nsee Brown 2023). What is at the core of Russellian monism, one might\ncontend, is only that there are quiddities that both underlie\nstructural features physics describes and are relevant to\nconsciousness. So, of the three claims we have described as core\nRussellian monist theses, perhaps only the second and the third\nqualify as such. Or instead, Russellian monists might retain\nstructuralism about physics but explicate it in a way that is\nrelatively uncontroversial (or at least less controversial than it\noften is), e.g., as a view about currentphysics.\n4.2 Constitution and Emergence\n\nAs noted above\n (section 1.1),\n many Russellian monists claim that macrophenomenal properties are\nconstituted by quiddities, or by quiddities and structure.\nBut not all do. Instead, some claim that macrophenomenal properties\nemerge from quiddities, or from quiddities and structure\n(Goff 2015), where emergence is taken to be a (diachronic or\nsynchronic) causal relation.\n\nHowever, some object that the causal-emergence construal undermines\nthe claim that on Russellian monism consciousness is integrated into\nphysical causation (Alter and Nagasawa 2012: 81; Chalmers 2013 [2015:\n253\u2013259]). The objection could be stated as follows. On the\ncausal-emergence construal, there are causal laws connecting\nquiddities (or quiddities and structural properties) to\nmacrophenomenal consciousness: laws that are neither a priori\nentailed nor metaphysically necessitated by the structural truths that\nphysical theory describes. In this respect, such laws would be just\nlike psychophysical laws posited by traditional interactionist\ndualism. And it is precisely because of the need to posit such\npsychophysical laws that traditional interactionist dualism is charged\nwith failing to integrate consciousness adequately into physical\ncausation (Smart 1959). Thus, on the causal-emergence construal, that\ncharge would apply equally to Russellian monism (but see Goff 2015:\n294\u201397; 2017: Part II passim).\n4.3 Physical Quiddities\n\nMuch (though by no means all) of the recent discussion of Russellian\nmonism focuses on Russellian physicalism, on which quiddities are\nphysical properties. But there is no well-developed conception of\nphysical quiddities, or at least none that is widely accepted. This\nhas prompted speculation as to what such properties might be like.\n\nDerk Pereboom (2011: ch. 5) identifies some candidates for physical\nquiddities in the history of philosophy. One comes from the\nAristotelian tradition, on which matter is made up at least partly of\nprime matter. Prime materiality could be understood as a\nphysical quiddity that underlies matter, which is structural. On\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s (1252\u201356) Aristotelian view, for\ninstance, matter consists in extension in three dimensions, i.e.,\nquantity. But quantity is a form, and in Aquinas\u2019s view\na form must inhere in something. That something, he thinks, is prime\nmatter. Unlike quantity, prime materiality is not (in the terminology\nof\n section 1.1)\n a relatively intrinsic property of matter. Instead, it is an\nabsolutely intrinsic property of matter, and it could be seen as a\nphysical quiddity (Pereboom 2011: 85, 113). Admittedly, Aquinas held\nthat prime matter is unintelligible. But other Aristotelians did not\n(Pasnau 2009).\n\nAnother candidate for a physical quiddity that Pereboom identifies is\ndue to John Locke (1690). In Locke\u2019s conception,\nsolidity is the categorical basis for impenetrability, which\nis dispositional. Lockean solidity is \u201cthat which\nhinders the approach of two bodies when they move toward one\nanother\u201d (Locke 1690: II, iv, emphasis added). Lockean solidity\nis also what differentiates matter from space, and is a defining\nproperty of matter. On one plausible interpretation, Pereboom (2011:\n97\u2013100) suggests, Locke regards that property as an absolutely\nintrinsic property of matter and as a physical quiddity.\n\nA third candidate for physical quiddities, which is similar to Lockean\nsolidity, may be found in contemporary metaphysics. Many contemporary\nmetaphysicians accept that there exist non-Humean causal powers (see\nthe entry\n dispositions).\n Humeans identify causal powers with mere tendencies, which can be\nfully explicated by means of subjunctive conditionals such as,\n\u201cIf an electron were in the vicinity of a proton, it would\nattract that proton\u201d (Jacobs 2011). By contrast, non-Humeans\nidentify causal powers with properties that categorically ground\ntendencies\u2014much as Lockean solidity grounds impenetrability.\nSuch categorical properties are truthmakers for, and not explicable in\nterms of, subjunctive conditionals. For example, the causal power of\nan electron is a categorical property that makes subjunctive\nconditionals such as the one just specified (\u201cIf an\nelectron\u2026\u201d) true (Jacobs 2011; cf. Heil 2003, Jaworski\n2016). Such truthmakers could be construed as physical quiddities\n(Gundersen 2015, Pereboom 2016, 2019).\n\nSo, there are at least some candidates for what physical quiddities\nmight be like (for others, see, e.g., Chalmers 2013 [esp. 2015:\n270\u2013274]; Rosenberg 2004; Coleman 2012, 2015). Still, one might\nwonder if any of the candidates just described\u2014Aristotelian\nprime materiality, Lockean solidity, or non-Humean causal\npowers\u2014can serve all of the Russellian physicalist\u2019s\npurposes. Russellian physicalists argue that positing physical\nquiddities safeguards their theory from the conceivability and\nknowledge arguments\n (section 3.1).\n But suppose those quiddities are construed as non-Humean causal\npowers of physical entities such as electrons. Wouldn\u2019t Mary be\nin a position to fully understand such powers while she is still in\nthe room? (Pereboom 2011: 113\u2013114). If so, then the proposed\nconstrual would seem to undermine the Russellian physicalist\u2019s\nbasis for denying that her pre-release physical knowledge is\nincomplete. Similarly, one might argue that the proposed construal\nwould undermine the Russellian physicalist\u2019s contention that\nwhile a structural zombie world is ideally conceivable, a full-fledged\nzombie world is not. Parallel concerns arise for Aristotelian prime\nmateriality and Lockean solidity. Even if those properties could be\nconstrued as physical quiddities, they would not appear to facilitate\nthe Russellian physicalist\u2019s objective of providing a plausible\nresponse to the conceivability and knowledge arguments (cf. Botin\n2023).\n5. Final Words\n\nChalmers writes:\n\n\nIf we can find a reasonable solution to the combination problem for\neither [Russellian panpsychism or Russellian panprotopsychism], this\nview would immediately become the most promising solution to the\nmind\u2013body problem. (Chalmers 2013 [2015: 274])\n\n\nWhether or not Chalmers is right about this, many philosophers of mind\nbelieve that Russellian monism merits serious attention.\n",
