ABMs were introduced to examine the impact of these norms\non the communal inquiry. To this end, Douven (2010) and De Langhe\n(2013) enhanced the bounded confidence model by Hegselmann and Krause\n(2006; see\n Section 3.3)\n to study the impact of the Conciliatory and Steadfast Norms on the\ngoals of\n inquiry.[9]\n\n\nBoth models suggest that the impact of these norms is context\ndependent. In Douven\u2019s model, when data received through inquiry\nis not very noisy\u2014in the sense that it is indicative of the\ntruth rather than resulting from measurement errors\u2014conciliating\npopulations will be faster in discovering the truth than the steadfast\nones. Nevertheless, if the data becomes noisy, the simulations show a\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed. While steadfast populations get\nwithin a moderate distance of the truth relatively quickly, they\ndon\u2019t improve their accuracy in the subsequent rounds of the\nsimulation. In contrast, conciliating populations end up closer to the\ntruth but it takes them relatively longer to do so. This indicates\nthat whether a norm is optimal for the communal goals may largely\ndepend on contextual issues of inquiry, such as obtaining noise-free\nevidence. De Langhe comes to a similar conclusion, using a model that\nrepresents longstanding scientific disagreements and an inquiry\ninvolving multiple rivaling epistemic systems. The model is inspired\nby Goldman\u2019s (2010) idea that even though disagreeing peers may\nshare the evidence concerning the issue in question, they may not\nshare the evidence for the epistemic system within which they evaluate\nthe former kind of evidence. His simulations suggest that while\nconciliating within one\u2019s epistemic system is beneficial, that\nis not the case when it comes to disagreements between different\nepistemic\n systems.[10]\n\n",
