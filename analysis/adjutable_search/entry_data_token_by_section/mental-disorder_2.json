The Mental in Mental Disorder\n\nIn a once-common practice, mental or \u201cfunctional\u201d\ndisorders were diagnosed just when no somatic traits were evident.\nSuch language is now explicitly disavowed, eclipsed by a growing\nrecognition that all disorders involve bodily states ( APA 2013: 309;\nO\u2019Leary 2021). Still, the \u201cmental\u201d in mental\ndisorder is variously construed.\n",
