    "main_text": "Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty || Hedonist Conceptions\n2.4 Hedonist Conceptions\n\nThinkers of the 18th century\u2014many of them oriented\ntoward empiricism\u2014accounted for beauty in terms of pleasure. The\nItalian historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori, for example, in quite a\ntypical formulation, says that \u201cBy beautiful we\ngenerally understand whatever, when seen, heard, or understood,\ndelights, pleases, and ravishes us by causing within us agreeable\nsensations\u201d (see Carritt 1931, 60). In Hutcheson it is not clear\nwhether we ought to conceive beauty primarily in terms of classical\nformal elements or in terms of the viewer\u2019s pleasurable\nresponse. He begins the Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of\nBeauty and Virtue with a discussion of pleasure. And he appears\nto assert that objects which instantiate his \u2018compound ratio of\nuniformity and variety\u2019 are peculiarly or necessarily capable of\nproducing pleasure:\n\n\nThe only Pleasure of sense, which our Philosophers seem to consider,\nis that which accompanys the simple Ideas of Sensation; But there are\nvastly greater Pleasures in those complex Ideas of objects, which\nobtain the Names of Beautiful, Regular, Harmonious. Thus every one\nacknowledges he is more delighted with a fine Face, a just Picture,\nthan with the View of any one Colour, were it as strong and lively as\npossible; and more pleased with a Prospect of the Sun arising among\nsettled Clouds, and colouring their Edges, with a starry Hemisphere, a\nfine Landskip, a regular Building, than with a clear blue Sky, a\nsmooth Sea, or a large open Plain, not diversify\u2019d by Woods,\nHills, Waters, Buildings: And yet even these latter Appearances are\nnot quite simple. So in Musick, the Pleasure of fine Composition is\nincomparably greater than that of any one Note, how sweet, full, or\nswelling soever. (Hutcheson 1725, 22)\n\n\nWhen Hutcheson then goes on to describe \u2018original or absolute\nbeauty,\u2019 he does it, as we have seen, in terms of the qualities\nof the beautiful thing (a \u201ccompound ratio\u201d of uniformity and variety),\nand yet throughout, he insists that beauty is centered in the human\nexperience of pleasure. But of course the idea of pleasure could come\napart from Hutcheson\u2019s particular aesthetic preferences, which\nare poised precisely opposite Plotinus\u2019s, for example. That we\nfind pleasure in a symmetrical rather than an asymmetrical building\n(if we do) is contingent. But that beauty is connected to pleasure\nappears, according to Hutcheson, to be necessary, and the pleasure\nwhich is the locus of beauty itself has ideas rather than things as\nits objects.\n\nHume writes in a similar vein in the Treatise of Human\nNature:\n\n\nBeauty is such an order and construction of parts as, either by the\nprimary constitution of our nature, by custom, or by caprice, is\nfitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul. \u2026\nPleasure and pain, therefore, are not only necessary attendants of\nbeauty and deformity, but constitute their very essence. (Hume 1740,\n299)\n\n\nThough this appears ambiguous as between locating the beauty in the\npleasure or in the impression or idea that causes it, Hume is soon\ntalking about the \u2018sentiment of beauty,\u2019 where sentiment\nis, roughly, a pleasurable or painful response to impressions or\nideas, though the experience of beauty is a matter of cultivated or\ndelicate pleasures. Indeed, by the time of Kant\u2019s Third Critique\nand after that for perhaps two centuries, the direct connection of\nbeauty to pleasure is taken as a commonplace, to the point where\nthinkers are frequently identifying beauty as a certain sort of\npleasure. Santayana, for example, as we have seen, while still\ngesturing in the direction of the object or experience that causes\npleasure, emphatically identifies beauty as a certain sort of\npleasure.\n\nOne result of this approach to beauty\u2014or perhaps an extreme\nexpression of this orientation\u2014is the assertion of the\npositivists that words such as \u2018beauty\u2019 are meaningless or\nwithout cognitive content, or are mere expressions of subjective\napproval. Hume and Kant were no sooner declaring beauty to be a matter\nof sentiment or pleasure and therefore to be subjective than they were\ntrying to ameliorate the sting, largely by emphasizing critical\nconsensus. But once this fundamental admission is made, any consensus\nseems contingent. Another way to formulate this is that it appears to\ncertain thinkers after Hume and Kant that there can be no\nreasons to prefer the consensus to a counter-consensus\nassessment. A.J. Ayer writes:\n\n\nSuch aesthetic words as \u2018beautiful\u2019 and\n\u2018hideous\u2019 are employed \u2026 not to make statements of\nfact, but simply to express certain feelings and evoke a certain\nresponse. It follows\u2026that there is no sense attributing\nobjective validity to aesthetic judgments, and no possibility of\narguing about questions of value in aesthetics. (Ayer 1952, 113)\n\n\nAll meaningful claims either concern the meaning of terms or are\nempirical, in which case they are meaningful because observations\ncould confirm or disconfirm them. \u2018That song is beautiful\u2019\nhas neither status, and hence has no empirical or conceptual content.\nIt merely expresses a positive attitude of a particular viewer; it is\nan expression of pleasure, like a satisfied sigh. The question of\nbeauty is not a genuine question, and we can safely leave it behind or\nalone. Most twentieth-century philosophers did just that.\n",
