    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || Moralism\n3.9 Moralism\n\nMill, we saw, appears to reject legal moralism categorically (I 9).\nOther Millian liberals, such as Feinberg, treat the rejection of legal\nmoralism as a constitutive commitment of liberalism. Of course, a\ngreat deal of morality is concerned with harm prevention, and central\nprovisions of the criminal law prohibiting killing, rape, assault, and\ntheft are clearly concerned to prevent especially serious moral wrongs\nthat harm others. This means that much of the criminal law both\nprevents harm and enforces morality. These are not simply coincidental\noutcomes, inasmuch as the immorality of much criminal conduct consists\nin its harmfulness. This could make us wonder if there are cases of\nlegal moralism that can\u2019t be justified by appeal to the harm\nprinciple.\n\nEven if there is considerable overlap between harmful conduct and\nwrongdoing, the two are distinguishable. The traditional debate over\nlegal moralism between Devlin (1965) and Hart (1963) concerned the\nlegislative enforcement of sexual morality, in particular, the\nregulation of homosexuality, prostitution, and pornography. For the\nmost part, both sides conceded that these activities were immoral but\nharmless and debated whether it could be permissible to regulate them\nas a matter of enforcing sexual morality. But we might reject\nDevlin\u2019s moralistic proposals, not because we reject legal\nmoralism per se, but rather because we do not regard\nhomosexuality, prostitution, or pornography as per se\nimmoral. If these were the only candidates for harmless wrongdoing, we\nmight wonder if there was such a thing. For this reason, we might\nconsider a less controversial case of harmless immorality, say, a case\nof promise-breaking or deception that actually fails to result in\nharm. Suppose Junior takes his parents\u2019 car out without their\npermission but nothing untoward happens. Here is a case of harmless\nwrongdoing. Consider this argument for moral legislation.\n\nSociety has reason to prohibit behavior that is immoral, whether\nor not it causes harm.\nJunior\u2019s taking the car without parental permission is a\ncase of harmless wrongdoing.\nHence, society has a right to prohibit Junior\u2019s\nbehavior.\n\n\nPresumably, liberals would reject (3), claiming that this is a case in\nwhich the law should not intervene. Here, it might seem that we need\nto reject the moralistic premise in (1) in order to avoid the\nilliberal conclusion in (3). Indeed, many people tend to think that to\navoid illiberal conclusions about moral legislation one must reject\nlegal moralism as such.\n\nBut the argument is not valid, from which it follows that we cannot\nappeal to the falsity of the illiberal conclusion to reject the\nmoralistic premise. The legal moralist principle (1) asserts only a\npro tanto or prima facie reason to regulate. But a\npro tanto reason to regulate does not entail an\nall-thing-considered reason to regulate. In particular, even if there\nis some reason to regulate conduct, there may be countervailing\nreasons not to regulate it. Perhaps the costs of\nregulation\u2014administrative and otherwise\u2014exceed the benefit\nof regulation. But this shows that the legal moralist need not\nregulate all harmless wrongdoing, and this shows that it is not\nnecessary to reject legal moralism as such in order to defend some\nliberal conclusions. This does not entail that Mill\u2019s rejection\nof legal moralism is wrong, only that it is not necessary to deliver\nmost of his liberal conclusions.\n\nThis shows us that we should distinguish stronger and weaker legal\nmoralist claims.\n\nWeak Moralism: an action\u2019s wrongness is pro\ntanto reason to regulate it.\nStrong Moralism: an action\u2019s wrongness is\nconclusive reason to regulate it.\n\n\nAs we\u2019ve just seen, liberal claims that harmless immorality\nshould not be regulated are inconsistent with strong moralism, but not\nwith weak moralism. It\u2019s clear that Mill rejects strong\nmoralism. What is less clear is whether he also rejects weak moralism.\nWe must endorse weak moralism if we think that there are cases of\nharmless wrongdoing where legal regulation is not only pro\ntanto justified but also on-balance justified. Any list is\npotentially controversial, but many people would think that it is not\nonly permissible but also desirable to regulate unsuccessful criminal\nattempts, fraud and blackmail that do not harm, desecration of the\ndead, and bestiality. If any of these should be regulated, that may\nrequire weak legal moralism.\n3.10 The Categorical Approach Revisited\n\nMill\u2019s \u201cone very simple principle\u201d\u2014that\nliberty may be restricted always and only to prevent harm to\nanother\u2014is over-simple. So too is the related categorical\napproach to liberty that approves all applications of the harm\nprinciple and rejects all cases of paternalism, censorship, offense\nregulation, and legal moralism.\n\nThe harm principle itself is complex in several ways. Harm to others\nis not a sufficient ground for restricting liberty. Rather, it creates\na pro tanto reason for restricting liberty. Determination of\nwhether restrictions on harmful conduct are fully justified depends on\nbalancing the evils of regulation against the harm to be prevented.\nMoreover, it is not clear if the harm principle justifies restricting\nliberty to prevent others from being harmed or only justifies\nrestricting liberty to prevent those whose liberty is being restricted\nfrom causing harm to another. The anti-harming rationale for\nrestricting liberty is narrower than the harm-prevention rationale.\nOnly the broader harm-prevention rationale would explain how Mill\ncould hope to square Good Samaritan laws and laws compelling testimony\nin court with the harm principle. Because the harm-prevention\nprinciple is broader, it will justify greater restrictions on liberty\nthan the anti-harming principle. It is also unclear whether the harm\nprinciple protects all liberty or just basic liberties. The harm\nprinciple is more robust if it targets restrictions on basic\nliberties, rather than liberty per se. But if we qualify the\nharm principle in these ways, we are very far from the common\nlibertarian reading of the harm principle as limiting any and all\nliberty only to prevent force or fraud.\n\nHowever these questions are resolved, it is doubtful that the harm\nprinciple is necessary to justify restrictions on liberty. Mill makes\nprincipled exceptions to his general anti-paternalism to defend the\npermissibility of restrictions on selling oneself into slavery and\nother autonomy-enhancing forms of paternalism. Mill does allow some\nforms of offense regulation designed to prevent public indecency.\nMoreover, though Mill does seem more consistent in his opposition to\nlegal moralism, it is not necessary to reject legal moralism as such\nin order to recognize the liberal conclusion that many forms of legal\nmoralism do not do enough good in order to justify the harms they\ncause.\n\nHarm prevention is neither necessary nor sufficient to restrict\nindividual liberties. Nonetheless, one might argue that Mill\nrecognizes basic liberties as especially important interests that can\nonly be interfered with to prevent harm to others and or to prevent\nsignificant harm to the individual\u2019s own agency.\n3.11 Utilitarianism, Rights, and Liberalism\n\nHaving examined Mill\u2019s liberalism we can return to the apparent\ntension between liberal rights and utilitarianism. For even if Mill\nemploys complex, rather than simple, categories, there appears to be a\ntension between categorical protections of basic liberties and the\nsort of case-by-case consequentialist analysis that utilitarianism\nwould seem to require. We might consider three different\nreconciliation strategies.\n3.11.1 The Sanction Theory of Rights\n\nMill\u2019s explicit theory of rights is introduced in Chapter V of\nUtilitarianism in the context of his sanction theory of duty,\nwhich is an indirect form of utilitarianism that identifies wrong\nactions as actions that it is useful to sanction (U V 14).\nMill then introduces justice as a proper part of duty. Justice\ninvolves duties that are perfect duties\u2014that is, duties that are\ncorrelated with rights (V 15).\n\n\nJustice implies something which it is not only right to do, and wrong\nnot to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as a\nmatter of right. (V 15)\n\n\nMill explains his theory of rights in terms of the two elements in a\nrights violation\u2014an injury to the right holder and warranted\npunishment.\n\n\nThese [two] elements are, a hurt to some assignable person or persons\non the one hand, and a demand for punishment on the other. \u2026\n[T]hese two things include all that we mean when we speak of violation\nof a right. When we call anything a person\u2019s right, we mean that\nhe has a valid claim on society to protect him in the possession of\nit, either by the force of law, or by that of education and opinion.\nIf he has what we consider a sufficient claim, on whatever account, to\nhave something guaranteed to him by society, we say that he has a\nright to it. If we desire to prove that anything does not belong to\nhim by right, we think this is done as soon as it is admitted that\nsociety ought not to take measures for securing it to him, but should\nleave it to chance, or to his own exertions. (V 24)\n\n\nThis is a sanction theory of rights, akin to Mill\u2019s sanction\ntheory of duty. It says that one has a right to some interest or\nliberty insofar as society ought to protect that interest or\nliberty.\n\nSo far, this conception of a right does not yet introduce any\nutilitarian considerations. Mill adds utilitarianism to the mix in his\naccount of the conditions under which society ought to enforce an\nindividual\u2019s claim.\n\n\nTo have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society\nought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes on to\nask why it ought, I can give him no other reason than general utility.\n(V 25)\n\n\nThis sanction theory of rights is an indirect utilitarian one insofar\nas it implies that whether someone has a right to something depends\nnot on the utility of that claim but on the utility of our responses\nto violations of that claim.\n\nDoes the sanction theory of rights provide a good reconciliation of\nrights and utility? Not surprisingly, the sanction theory of rights\ninherits the problems of the sanction theory of duty. Recall that we\nfound sanction utilitarianism to be internally inconsistent insofar as\nit combines indirect and direct utilitarian claims\n (\u00a72.10).\n Because the sanction theory of rights is committed to sanction\nutilitarianism, it inherits this inconsistency.\n\nX has a right to Y iff society ought to protect\nX\u2019s claim to Y from interference (the first\npart of the sanction theory of rights).\nSociety ought to protect X\u2019s claim to Y\nfrom interference iff doing so is optimal (the second, direct part of\nthe sanction theory of rights).\nSociety ought to protect X\u2019s claim to Y\nfrom interference iff it would be optimal to blame society for failing\nto do so (the indirect sanction theory of duty).\n\n\n(2) and (3) are inconsistent. One could respond by decoupling the\nsanction theory of rights from the sanction theory of duty. But if we\nreject the sanction theory of duty, why accept a sanction theory of\nrights?\n\nMoreover, the sanction theory of rights has problems of its own. The\nsanction theory of rights treats the desirability of social\nenforcement as constitutive of the idea of a right. But this seems to\nget things backward. It is because we have rights that society ought\nto enforce them; it is not that we have rights to whatever society\nought to enforce. The desirability of social enforcement seems\nconsequential on the existence of the right. This is even\nclearer, because there are some claims that society ought to enforce\nthat are not rights. Among the things that society ought to recognize\nand protect are both rights and privileges. The exact line\nbetween rights and privileges is not always clear. But we recognize\nthe distinction in claiming that some interests and opportunities that\nthe state ought to protect are not ones that can be claimed as a\nmatter of right. This shows that the usefulness of social enforcement\ncannot be constitutive of a right, because otherwise privileges would\nbe rights.\n\nThough the sanction theory is Mill\u2019s explicit conception of\nrights, he has the resources for two other conceptions.\n3.11.2 Rights as Secondary Principles\n\nWe saw that Mill recognizes the need for various secondary principles\nin moral reasoning\n (\u00a72.9).\n These are principles that do not themselves refer to utility but\nwhose adoption and general deployment are justified on utilitarian\ngrounds. So one way for Mill to reconcile rights and utility is for\nhim to treat rights as secondary principles, perhaps especially\nimportant ones, whose observance is justified on utilitarian grounds\n(also see Berger 1984: chs. 3\u20134). On this interpretation, rights\nare protected by rules that insulate an individual\u2019s interest or\nliberty from certain kinds of interference and that make no direct\nreference to the good consequences of insulation. We should observe\nsuch rules more or less uncritically, and set them aside only when\nadherence to them is clearly suboptimal or in cases of conflicts among\nsuch rules (rights). In such exceptional cases, we should make direct\nappeal to the principle of utility. But, otherwise, not.\n\nWhy should we regulate our conduct by such rules? Because doing so is\ngenerally but imperfectly optimal, and we are unable to discriminate\nfor cases in which deviation form the rules is suboptimal without\ndeviating from them in other cases in which it is not.\n3.11.3 Rights as Pre-eminent Goods\n\nWhy should we believe that there are interests or liberties that it is\ngenerally but imperfectly optimal to protect? Mill\u2019s answer is\nthat some interests and liberties play a more fundamental role in\nhuman happiness than others. On this reading, rights protect\npre-eminent or especially important goods.\n\n\nWhile I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up an\nimaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility, I account the\njustice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part, and\nincomparably the most sacred and binding part, of all morality.\nJustice is a name for certain classes of moral rules which concern the\nessentials of human well-being more nearly, and are therefore of more\nabsolute obligation, than any other rules for the guidance of life;\nand the notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of\njustice\u2014that of a right residing in an individual\u2014implies\nand testifies to this more binding obligation. (U V 32; also\nsee V 33, 37\u201338)\n\n\nIndeed, if the goods protected by rights are so important, we can\nunderstand why Mill might think that society ought to enforce them by\nlaw or opinion (V 24). But notice that here enforceability is a\nconsequence of the importance of rights, rather than the defining\nfeature of rights.\n\nThis conception of rights presupposes a hierarchy of values\nin which some kinds of goods are superior to others. We know that Mill\naccepts a hierarchy of values from his doctrine of higher pleasures.\nThat doctrine treats the possession and use of capacities for\npractical deliberation as higher-order goods. Various liberties of\nthought and action are important as necessary conditions for realizing\nthese higher-order goods.\n\nBut if the rights we have are to especially important goods, then we\ncan see how honoring rights promotes the good. By hypothesis, it will\nbe best to honor rights when this conflicts with the promotion of\nlesser goods. We might say that rights \u201ctrump\u201d these\nlesser goods. Rights don\u2019t trump the pursuit of other comparably\nimportant goods. These should be treated as conflicts of rights, and\nthe utilitarian should resolve such conflicts by recourse to the\nutilitarian first principle and a determination of which right, in the\ncontext, is most important.\n\nThese three conceptions of rights offer somewhat different ways of\nreconciling utility and rights. The biggest difference is between the\nsanction theory, on the one hand, and the secondary principle and\npre-eminent goods conceptions, on the other hand, because the first is\nan indirect utilitarian conception of rights, whereas the second two\nare compatible with direct utilitarianism. Whereas the sanction theory\nof rights appears problematic, the secondary principles and\npre-eminent goods conceptions appear more plausible. It would be\npremature to say that they are fully adequate conceptions of rights,\nbut they do offer some promise of reconciling utility and rights.\n4. Liberal Democracy\n\nWe get a somewhat different perspective on Mill\u2019s utilitarian\nand liberal principles by seeing how he applies them to social and\npolitical issues. We might begin by focusing on Mill\u2019s defense\nof a democratic form of liberalism in Considerations on\nRepresentative Government and Principles of Political\nEconomy.\n\nIn Considerations on Representative Government Mill argues\nthat a form of representative democracy is the best ideal form of\ngovernment. It is not an invariant ideal that holds regardless of\nhistorical or social circumstances. But he does think that it is the\nbest form of government for societies with sufficient resources,\nsecurity, and culture of self-reliance. In particular, Mill thinks\nthat representative democracy is best, when it is best, because it\nbest satisfies two criteria of all good government: (1) that\ngovernment is good insofar as it promotes the common good, where this\nis conceived of as promoting the moral, intellectual, and active\ntraits of its citizens, and (2) that government is good insofar as it\nmakes effective use of institutions and the resources of its citizens\nto promote the common good (CRG 390, 392). Insofar as (2) is\nreally a component of (1), Mill\u2019s ultimate criterion is that\ngood government should promote the common good of its citizens. Mill\ndoes not explicitly invoke his version of utilitarianism. Perhaps he\nwants his defense of representative democracy to rest on more\necumenical premises. But he clearly understands this political\ncriterion of the common good in broadly consequentialist or\nresult-oriented terms. Moreover, though he may not mention the higher\npleasures doctrine explicitly, it is also clear that Mill understands\nthe good of each in broadly perfectionist terms that emphasize the\nimportance of an active and autonomous form of life that exercises\nintellectual, deliberative, and creative capacities.\n4.1 Representative Democracy\n\nMill thinks that there are two ways in which democracy is, under the\nright circumstances, best suited to promote the common good.\n\nFirst, he thinks that democracy plays an important epistemic\nrole in identifying the common good. Proper deliberation about issues\naffecting the common good requires identifying the consequences\nof different policies for the interests of affected parties\nand so requires the proper representation and articulation of the\ninterests of citizens. But failure of imagination and the operation of\npersonal bias present obstacles to the effective representation of the\ninterests of others. Universal suffrage and political participation\nprovide the best assurance that the interests of the governed will be\nproperly appreciated by political decision-makers (404).\n\nSecond, Mill thinks that democracy is also the best form of government\nbecause of the constitutive effects of political\nparticipation on the improvement of the moral capacities of citizens\n(404). To the extent that the governed can and do participate in\npublic debate and elections they exercise those very deliberative\ncapacities that it is the aim of government to develop. They learn to\ngather information about their options, deliberate about their merits,\nand choose a representative who will give expression to their\nideals and preferences. They deliberate and choose with others about a\npublic agenda, and in so doing they cultivate abilities to form a\nconception of a common good, to take principled stands, to exchange\nreasons with others, and to learn from others.\n\nSo far, these would seem to be arguments for widespread\u2014indeed,\nuniversal\u2014direct democracy. In fact, unlike many of his\ncontemporaries interested in expanding the franchise, Mill defends the\nextension of the franchise to women too, rejecting any restriction on\ntheir franchise as baseless (479). But Mill qualifies this defense of\ndirect democracy in various significant ways.\n\nDemocracy presumably involves rule by the will of the people. We might\nsay that a political system is democratic insofar as the content of\nits political decisions reflect the will of the people. A direct\ndemocracy, in which every citizen votes on legislation, is one way for\npolitical decisions to reflect the will of the people. But direct\ndemocracy is impractical in anything but a small community (412). Mill\ndefends representative, rather than direct, democracy.\n\nMill believes that representatives are charged with the task of\nvoting, after free and open discussion, their own considered views\nabout what would promote the common good (490). Here Mill expresses\ndoubts about an interest group model of democracy, according to which\nrepresentatives are advocates of the sectarian interests of their\nconstituents and democracy is seen as an impartial aggregation and set\nof compromises among sectarian interests. Instead, Mill regards\nrepresentatives as fiduciaries in a public trust, in which each\nrepresentative aims at a genuinely common good, and in which\nindividual and collective deliberations are shaped by a diversity of\nexperiences and perspectives.\n\nMany needs are local in nature, and, even when the needs are general,\ntheir satisfaction may depend heavily on local conditions. For this\nreason, Mill advocates a federal system in which a central\nrepresentative body has more limited functions and local or municipal\nrepresentative bodies govern in matters involving local affairs or\nlocal detail, such as the creation and maintenance of local\ninfrastructure, including roads, courts, jails, and schools\n(422\u201334).\n\nHowever, one important function of a central government, Mill\nbelieves, is the need to protect local political minorities from being\nsystematically disadvantaged by local political majorities (544). Here\nhe shows his concern with individual rights against the tyranny of the\nmajority, which was a focus of On Liberty and suggests\nthat constitutional guarantees may be better preserved by central,\nrather than local, authorities. Unfortunately, he does not devote much\nattention to exactly which individual rights should be recognized\nconstitutionally.\n\nMill also insists that a representative democracy, either local or\nfederal, should employ proportional, rather than\nwinner-take-all, representation (CRG 449\u201362;\n\u201cThoughts on Parliamentary Reform\u201d 328\u201329). We can\nsee how proportional representation fits with the epistemic argument\nfor democracy. Winner-take-all representation may eliminate or reduce\neffective expression of minority points of view so essential for free\nand informed inquiry about the common good and respecting the\ninterests of political minorities (CRG 458).\n4.2 The Scope of the Franchise and Weighted Voting\n\nIn his philosophical writings and in his service as a Liberal member\nof Parliament for Westminster from 1865 to 1868, Mill was a vigorous\nadvocate for extending the franchise. Though he recognized some limits\nin the scope of the franchise, he was a consistent, though not always\nsuccessful, advocate for its extension beyond its then\ncurrent scope. He supported extending the franchise to previously\ndisenfranchised members of the working class, and he was a staunch\nadvocate for female suffrage (479\u201381). To many, such views about\nthe appropriate scope of the franchise seemed quite radical. Though\nMill did support weighted voting, he may have seen this, at least in\npart, as a necessary concession to succeed in securing his primary\nobjective of (near) universal suffrage (476). It is worth bearing this\ncontext in mind when evaluating Mill\u2019s proposals for the scope\nand weight of the franchise.\n\nAs we noted earlier, Mill does not defend representative democracy as\nideal under all historical and social circumstances. There are some\nsocial circumstances, he thinks, in which democracy will not promote\nthe common good. These are backward states of society in which most\ncitizens are unfit to rule, because they lack necessary ingredients of\nthe culture of autonomy to exercise decision-making authority\nresponsibly. They lack discipline, or education, or an active and\nindependent character. Different forms of government are appropriate\nfor such backward states of advancement. In particular, Mill thinks\nthat benevolent rule by an enlightened one or few, which aimed at the\ncommon good, would be better suited for such societies (415\u201318).\nHere, Mill is introducing a scope limitation on the defense of\npolitical rights that he recognized explicitly in his defense of basic\nliberties in On Liberty (I 10). There are important practical\nquestions, which Mill does not address very clearly, about which\nsocieties cross this threshold of capacity for improvement by free\ninquiry and political rights. We might reasonably disagree with\nMill about what the competence threshold is and which societies\nsatisfy \n it.[2] \n But he does make clear that political participation, like free\ninquiry, is important as a necessary condition for the exercise of our\nhigher capacities and has value only when a threshold level of\nnormative competence is met.\n\nWhat is true of some societies in relation to others is also true of\nsome individuals in relation to others within societies that cross\nthis threshold of normative competence. This explains limitations on\nthe scope of the franchise that Mill recognizes within such advanced\ncivilizations. He confines the scope of the franchise to mature\nadults, excluding minors who would not have crossed the threshold of\nnormative competence. He is also prepared to exclude those adults who\nare not literate (CRG 470\u201371). This is a failure of\nnormative competence for which society is to blame and which it is\nsociety\u2019s duty to correct (470). Mill also excludes from the\nfranchise those adults who do not pay taxes and are on public\nassistance (472). Here he expresses the concern that voting gives one\na say not only over one\u2019s own life but also over the lives of\nothers and that without contributing to the production of an economic\nsurplus one has no right to help determine how this surplus is\ndistributed. Mill is also committed to doubts about the normative\ncompetence of those on public assistance. Elsewhere, Mill insists that\ncharities make beneficiaries dependent on benefactors in ways that\ncompromise their autonomy and independence (PPE V.xi.13;\nSW 330). Insofar as this is true, it provides an additional\nrationale for excluding dependents from the franchise.\n\nThe main limitations on the scope of the franchise that Mill\nrecognizes track this threshold of normative competence. Mill thinks\nthat the reasons for favoring democracy apply to all those above this\nnormative threshold. Literate manual laborers have the same claim to\nthe franchise, Mill thinks, as anyone else. They need to stand up for\ntheir own interests and make sure they are properly reckoned in\npolitical decision-making. Moreover, they stand to benefit from\npolitical participation, because of the way it develops their\ndeliberative capacities.\n\nOf course, there are differences in normative competence among those\nabove this threshold. But Mill\u2019s account of representative\ndemocracy tracks these further differences in terms of the\nweight, rather than the scope, of the franchise\n(CRG 473). Differences in normative competence above this\nthreshold should affect the comparative weight of one\u2019s vote.\nThis scheme of weighted voting takes the form of a system of plural\nvotes (CRG 467\u201381; also see \u201cParliamentary\nReform\u201d 322\u201328). Mill emphatically rejects property\nqualifications as suitable proxies for normative competence\n(CRG 474; \u201cParliamentary Reform\u201d 325) and insists\non educational qualifications.\n\n\nThe most direct mode of effecting this, would be to establish the\nplurality of votes, in favour of those who could afford a reasonable\npresumption of superior knowledge and cultivation. \u2026 The\nperfection, then, of an electoral system would be, that every person\nshould have one vote, but that every well-educated person in the\ncommunity should have more than one, on a scale corresponding as far\nas practicable to their amount of education. (\u201cParliamentary\nReform\u201d 324\u201325)\n\n\nThere is an upper limit on the system of plural votes such that the\nweighted votes of the educational elite will not give them a majority\ncoalition that could advance its class interests at the expense of the\nuneducated (CRG 476).\n\nMill\u2019s commitment to weighted voting reflects his views about\nthe backward state of the working classes.\n\n\nThe opinions and wishes of the poorest and rudest class of labourers\nmay be very useful as one influence among others on the minds of the\nvoters, as well as on those of the Legislature; and yet it may be\nhighly mischievous to give them the preponderant influence, but\nadmitting them, in their present state of morals and intelligence, to\nthe full exercise of the suffrage. (\u201cParliamentary Reform\u201d\n334)\n\n\nDespite these doubts about the working classes, Mill regarded himself\nas their friend (Autobiography 274; see Ten 1998). Mill did\nnot blame the working classes for what he saw as their lesser\ncompetence, and he did not regard their backwardness as a natural\nor permanent condition. He thought that improved access to quality\nprimary and secondary education and greater scope for civic\nparticipation would gradually improve normative competence in the\nworking classes (PPE IV.vii.2). Insofar as this is true, the\nqualification to Mill\u2019s commitment to political equality,\nrepresented by his scheme of weighted voting, is temporary and\ntransitional. In this sense, weighted voting is not part of ideal\npolitical theory in the way that (near) universal suffrage and\nproportional representation are.\n\nEven if weighted voting tracks the epistemic reasons for democracy and\ndifferences in underlying normative competence, it violates norms of\npolitical equality. Mill seems not to recognize the potentially\ncorrosive effects of weighted voting in terms of the message it sends\nof second-class citizenship to the working classes. He thinks that\nself-respect requires only that one have the vote, not that one have\nan equal vote, regardless of normative competence.\n\n\nThere is not, in this arrangement [weighted voting], anything\nnecessarily invidious to those to whom it assigns the lower degrees of\ninfluence. Entire exclusion from a voice in the common concerns is one\nthing; the concession to others of a more potential voice, on the\nground of greater capacity for the management of the joint interests,\nis another. The two things are not merely different, they are\nincommensurable. Everyone has a right to feel insulted by being made a\nnobody, and stamped as of no account at all. No one but a fool\n\u2026 feels offended by the acknowledgment that there are others\nwhose opinion \u2026 is entitled to a greater amount of\nconsideration than his. (CRG 474)\n\n\nBut why should I care so much about being branded a nobody and not at\nall about being branded a lesser somebody? One might well want to\nharness the resources and expertise of an educated elite, perhaps, as\nMill already imagines, by giving them special roles in the drafting of\nlegislation or in setting the agenda for public deliberations. But\nthis does not require giving the educated elite plural votes. Doing\nthat seems to have significant symbolic value, saying that working\nclasses should have less political standing and say. From this\nperspective, Mill displays something of a tin ear for\negalitarian concerns about weighted voting. Interestingly, while\nhe does not seem especially sensitive to concerns about the bad\neffects of second-class citizenship in Considerations on\nRepresentative Government, he seems much more sensitive to such\nconcerns in The Subjection of Women. As we will see, Mill is\nacutely aware of the variety of ways in which women\u2019s\ncontributions can be discouraged and undervalued and of the individual\nand social costs of women\u2019s second-class status. Had Mill been\nas mindful of the costs of according workers second-class citizenship\nas he would later be of the costs of according women second-class\nstatus, he might have been more skeptical of weighted voting than he\nin fact was.\n4.3 Liberal Democracy and the Common Good\n\nWhat of the substance of democratic government? Though Mill is an\nadvocate of limited government in ways that one might expect given his\ndefense of basic liberties in On Liberty, he is no\nlibertarian. He emphatically rejects the idea that legitimate\ngovernment is limited to the functions of affording protection against\nforce and fraud (PPE V.i.2). Instead, he thinks that there\nare a variety of ways in which government can and should intervene in\nthe lives of citizens\u2014sometimes as coercer and other times as\nenabler or facilitator\u2014in order to promote the common good.\nMill\u2019s claims about happiness imply that the good of each\nconsists in the exercise of her higher capacities. This requires an\nactive life in which one\u2019s activities are regulated by\none\u2019s deliberations and choices. As we have seen in Mill\u2019s\ncritical discussions of paternalism, this places limits on how others\ncan promote one\u2019s own good. I can\u2019t promote your good,\nunderstood in this way, in ways that bypass your agency anymore than I\ncan win a race for you. But just as I can do things to help you win\nthe race yourself (training with you, sharing nutritional tips, and\nhelping you plan strategy), so too I can do things that help you lead\nan autonomous life. I can provide various sorts of necessary\nconditions for your leading such a life. If an individual\u2019s good\nconsists in this sort of self-realization, then a government\nwhich aims at the common good should concern itself in significant\npart with the fair provision of opportunities for\nwelfare.\n\nEarly in The Subjection of Women Mill contrasts systems of\nhereditary caste, such as feudalism and social systems based on\nslavery, with the distinctively modern and progressive commitment to\nequal opportunity for welfare.\n\n\nFor, what is the peculiar character of the modern world\u2014the\ndifference which chiefly distinguishes modern institutions, modern\nsocial ideas, modern life itself, from those of times long past? It is\nthat human beings are no longer born into their place in life, and\nchained down by an inexorable bond to the place they are born to, but\nare free to employ their faculties, and such favorable chances as\noffer, to achieve the lot which may appear to them most desirable.\n(SW 272\u201373)\n\n\nAs with basic liberties, opportunities for welfare have value, not in\nthemselves, but as necessary conditions for the sort of\nself-realization to which Mill assigns pre-eminent intrinsic value.\nBut they are no less important for that reason. Indeed, many of the\nfunctions of government that he recognizes can be traced to providing\nconditions and opportunities for self-realization.\n\nThough Mill generally opposes paternalism, censorship, offense\nregulation, and moralism, he does recognize various functions that\ngovernment should perform in pursuing the common good. In part because\nthe opportunities for each depend in part upon the position and\nresources of others, Mill thinks that provision of fair equality of\nopportunity constrains permissible socio-economic inequalities\n(PPE II.ii.1).\n\n\nA just and wise legislation would abstain from holding out motives for\ndissipating rather than saving the earnings of honest exertion. Its\nimpartiality between competitors would consist in endeavoring that\nthey should all start fair \u2026. Many, indeed, fail with greater\nefforts than those with which others succeed, not from difference of\nmerits, but difference of opportunities; but if all were done which it\nwould be in the power of a good government to do, by instruction and\nby legislation, to diminish this inequality of opportunities, the\ndifferences of fortune arising from people\u2019s own earnings could\nnot justly give umbrage. (PPE V.ii.3)\n\n\nAs Mill makes clear in this passage, his concern is not with\ninequality as such. Though he envisions a society in which\ninequalities are reduced and in which a decent minimum standard of\nliving is available to all (PPE IV.vi.2), he does defend the\nprofits of capitalists as a just recompense for their savings, risk,\nand economic supervision (PPE II.xv.1; \u201cChapters on\nSocialism\u201d 734\u201335). Rather, Mill\u2019s concern in this\npassage is with inequalities derived from inequality of opportunity\nand those inequalities that perpetuate inequality of opportunity. To\nachieve equality of opportunity, Mill endorses various redistributive\ntax measures (also see Berger 1984: 159\u201386). He defends a flat\ntax rate on earned income above a threshold necessary to secure a\ndecent minimum standard of living, leaving earned income below this\nthreshold untaxed (PPE II.i.3, II.xii.2, II.xii.3,\nV.ii.1\u20133, V.iii.3\u20135). In addition, he endorses the use of\nhigher tax rates on unearned income and on inheritance (PPE\nII.ii.1, II.ii.3\u20134, II.xii.3, V.ii.3, V.ii.5, V.vi.2, V.ix.1).\nSuch taxes limit intergenerational inequalities that would otherwise\nconstrain equality of opportunity.\n\nWithin this framework established for equal opportunity, Mill defends\nadditional governmental functions designed to promote the common good.\nA prime condition of normative competence is a decent education, and\nMill thinks that it is one of the central roles of the state to\nrequire and, if necessary, provide a quality education (OL V\n12\u201313; PPE V.xi.8). Mill thinks that the state can and\nshould require parents to provide schooling for their children,\nensuring that this kind of education is available to all, regardless\nof financial circumstances, by subsidizing the costs of education for\nthe poor so that it is available free or at a nominal cost.\n\nWe have also seen that Mill thinks that charity breeds dependence,\nrather than autonomy. This is one reason that he defends the adoption\nof Poor Laws that provide, among other things, work for the\nable-bodied indigent (PPE II.xii.2). Mill also thinks that\ngovernment should step in where market forces are unlikely to provide\nwhat people need or want (PPE V.xi.8). In this way, he thinks\nthat it is an important function for the state, whether central or\nlocal, to create and maintain various aspects of community\ninfrastructure, including such things as a common defense, roads,\nsanitation, police, and correctional facilities (PPE V.vii.1;\nCRG 541). He also thinks regulation of working conditions\n(hours, wages, and benefits) is permissible, because the provision of\nimproved working conditions typically has the structure of a public or\ncollective good for workers, each of whom stands to gain a competitive\nadvantage by conceding a little more to capital than his peers\n(PPE V.xi.12). If left unregulated, each has incentive to\nconcede more to capital than his rivals, with the result that all\nworkers are made worse-off. State intervention and regulation, Mill\nthinks, is the best solution to this collective action problem. He\nalso thinks that there are other goods for which market provision will\nlead to underproduction, presumably because of positive externalities,\nwhich is why he thinks that the state should subsidize scientific\nresearch and the arts (PPE V.xi.15).\n\nMill\u2019s liberalism is committed to democratic political\ninstitutions in which the franchise is widespread, private property\nrights, market economies, equal social and economic opportunity, and a\nvariety of personal and civic liberties. To appreciate the\nsignificance of his brand of liberalism, it is helpful to focus on the\nsubstance of his conception of liberal essentials\u2014the package of\nindividual liberties and state responsibilities that he\nendorses\u2014and the way he justifies his conception of liberal\nessentials. Millian liberalism is not laissez-faire liberalism, and it\njustifies liberal essentials as a way of promoting the common good.\nThe distinctiveness of this brand of liberalism is perhaps best seen\nin contrast with two other conceptions of liberalism\u2014a more\nlibertarian conception of liberal essentials and their justification\nthat dominated the British Liberal Party at mid-century and the sort\nof contemporary political liberalism that justifies liberal essentials\nas required if the state is to be neutral among rival conceptions of\nthe good life that its citizens might hold.\n\nA good part of the agenda of the Liberal Party during much of the\nnineteenth century consisted in reforms that sought to undo\nlimitations that the state placed on the liberties and opportunities\nof citizens, especially when these forms of state intervention tended\nto reinforce class privileges. This political culture was exemplified\nin the repeal of the Corn Laws, opposition to religious persecution,\nand several electoral reforms. But in the later part of the nineteenth\ncentury there emerged a new view about the role of such reforms within\nthe Liberal agenda. Earlier Liberals, such as Herbert Spencer, thought\nthat reform should be limited to the removal of state interference\nwith individual liberty. By contrast, the New Liberals thought that\nthese reforms that extended economic, social, and political liberties\nhad to be supplemented by social and economic reforms in areas of\nlabor, education, and health designed to redress the effects of\ninequality. These new reforms gave the state positive, and not just\nnegative, responsibilities that sometimes required interference with\nindividual liberties. Because Mill thinks that the state has an\nimportant role to play in securing equal opportunity, ensuring a good\neducation that will nurture normative competence, and redressing\nvarious market failures and providing various public goods, it makes\nsense to view Mill as laying much of the intellectual groundwork for\nthe New Liberalism\u2014both in its conception of liberal essentials\nand in its conception of the proper justification of liberal\nessentials by appeal to a broadly consequentialist interest in\npromoting self-realization.\n\nMill\u2019s perfectionist justification of liberal essentials also\nprovides a contrast with an influential strand in recent\nAnglo-American philosophical defenses of liberalism that insist on\nneutrality among rival conceptions of the good life (see\nTurner 2017). According to many contemporary liberals, neutrality\nabout the good is a constitutive commitment of liberalism, and liberal\nneutrality places limits on the justification of state action. Liberal\ngovernments, on this view, can and must enforce individual rights and\nany further demands of social justice, including those necessary to\nmaintain peace and order. But they are not to undertake any action as\na way of promoting a particular conception of the good life or a\ncomprehensive philosophical doctrine. On matters of the good, a\nliberal state must be strictly neutral. It can promote the good of its\ncitizenry only in ways that are consistent with every reasonable\nconception of the good (see Rawls 1993 and Kymlicka 1989).\n\nBy contrast, Mill is a perfectionist liberal who eschews neutrality\nabout the good. According to Millian perfectionism, the good life is\nnot defined in sectarian terms as consisting in a particular set of\nactivities. Rather, the good life is understood in terms of the\nexercise of capacities for practical deliberation that can be realized\nin diverse, though limited, ways. Basic liberties are important\nbecause they are necessary conditions for this sort of reflective\nself-direction and self-realization. On this version of liberalism,\nthe state recognizes various civil liberties and resists regular\npaternalism and moralism, not because it won\u2019t take a stand on\nquestions of the good, but precisely because it recognizes autonomy\nand self-determination as higher-order goods.\n5. Sexual Equality\n\nMill applies his liberal principles to issues of sexual equality\nprimarily in The Subjection of Women. He denounces existing\nforms of sexual inequality in clear and unequivocal terms.\n\n\n[T]he principle which regulates the existing social relations between\nthe two sexes\u2014the legal subordination of one sex to the\nother\u2014is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to\nhuman improvement; and \u2026 it ought to be replaced by a principle\nof perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side,\nnor disability on the other. (SW 261)\n\n\nTo modern ears, Mill\u2019s defense of sexual equality may seem\nobvious, and, to some contemporary feminists, Mill\u2019s criticism\nof sexual inequality may not be deep or consistent enough. But, when\nviewed in historical context, Mill\u2019s defense of sexual equality\nis radical, courageous, and sometimes eloquent (Shanley 1998). While\nMill clearly expected some aspects of his liberal principles in On\nLiberty to be controversial (OL I 6\u20138), their\nrevolutionary import became especially clear when he applied them\nto issues of sexual equality in The Subjection of Women\n(Nicholson 1998: 471).\n5.1 The Case for Sexual Equality\n\nMill rejects sexual inequality in both domestic and social contexts.\nHe discusses domestic equality primarily in Chapter II. There, he\nfocuses on the rights of wives and mothers, recognizing women\u2019s\nequal rights over their bodies or persons (SW 283\u201386),\nto own and control property (284\u201385, 297) to control various\naspects of domestic decision-making and household management\n(290\u201392), to custody and care of children (285), and to\nseparation and divorce (285\u201386). But Mill is not only concerned\nwith wives and mothers in domestic contexts. He also defends equal\nrights to education (315\u201316), to professional\nopportunities (299; cf. PPE IV.vii.3), to vote in political\nelections (301), and to run for political office (301). In addition to\nthese rights, Mill presumably also endorses equal rights to freedom of\nexpression, worship, and association. One assumes that he sees the\nmain threats to these rights as occurring in the domestic realm and\ncoming from husbands, fathers, and brothers.\n\nAt times, Mill defends sexual equality on explicitly consequentialist\ngrounds as a way of making fuller use of people\u2019s talents and\npromoting a culture of equal opportunity, accountability, and genuine\nmeritocracy (326\u201328). But Mill also defends sexual equality as a\nmatter of individual rights and justice.\n\n\nThus far, the benefits which it has appeared that the world would gain\nby ceasing to make sex a disqualification for privileges and a badge\nof subjection, are social rather than individual; consisting in an\nincrease of the general fund of thinking and acting power, and an\nimprovement in the general conditions of the association of men and\nwomen. But it would be a grievous understatement of the case to omit\nthe most direct benefit of all, the unspeakable gain in private\nhappiness to the liberated half of the species; the difference to them\nbetween a life of subjection to the will of others, and a life of\nrational freedom. After the primary necessities of food and raiment,\nfreedom is the first and strongest want to human nature. (336)\n\n\nIn elaborating this claim about women\u2019s higher-order interests\nin liberty, he says that personal independence is an \u201celement of\nhappiness\u201d (336\u201337). This echoes the arguments in On\nLiberty for claiming that basic liberties are necessary for\npersons to exercise the deliberative capacities that make them\nprogressive beings.\n\nIn defending women\u2019s rights, Mill also appeals to the\ndistinctively modern and progressive commitment to equal\nopportunity for welfare (272\u201373). At several points, he\nlikens the status of women inside and outside of marriage to slavery\n(284\u201386, 323). Mill is not much impressed by those who would\ndispute the analogy on the ground that women are treated much better\nthan slaves. Gilded cages are still cages that restrict freedom and\nopportunity. And often the cages are not gilded; Mill insists that\nhusbands can be and often are just as violent and abusive as masters\n(285\u201386, 288\u201389). Indeed, with the demise of slavery in\nAmerica, he views sexual inequality as the last vestige of slavery in\nthe West.\n\n\nThe law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all\nthe principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through\nwhich those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out. It\nis the sole case, now that negro slavery has been abolished, in which\na human being in the plenitude of every faculty is delivered up to the\ntender mercies of another human being, in the hope forsooth that this\nother will use the power solely for the good of the person subjected\nto it. Marriage is the only actual bondage known to our law. There\nremain no legal slaves, except the mistress of every house. (323)\n\n\nThe restrictions contained in Victorian marriage law that give\nhusbands complete control over the person and property of their wives\nand that do not allow for unilateral divorce or separation make\nmarriage a form of sexual or gendered slavery. Slavery is an\nimpermissible restriction of the liberty of another. Slavery would be\nimpermissible even if the wife consented to marriage (270). Mill might\nquestion whether the consent is meaningful given the social pressures\nto marry and to defer to their husbands, the limited options for those\nwho do not marry, and the adverse consequences to women of expressing\ndissent within marriage (270). But the quality of consent should be in\nany case irrelevant, because we know that Mill thinks that it is\nimpermissible to contract into slavery and that paternalistic laws\nthat prevent such contracts are not only permissible but obligatory\n(OL V 11). Presumably, this is just the sort of case that\nMill has in mind when he suggests that the prohibition of selling\noneself into slavery is a principled exception to the usual\nprohibition on paternalism that has \u201cwider application.\u201d\nThis norm of equal opportunity for welfare, which is violated by\nVictorian marriage law, is a demand of justice (SW 325) and\ngrounds a claim of right.\n5.2 Rebutting the Case for Inequality\n\nMill considers and replies to various actual and possible defenses of\nsexual inequality. In most cases, the apologist for inequality alleges\nthat women are naturally inferior in relation to men along some\ndimension that is alleged to be relevant to the proper management of\npersonal and public affairs. For the most part, the apologist claims\nthat men possess some trait essential for normative competence that\nwomen lack\u2014these might be represented as alleged female\ndeficits\u2014or that women possess some trait that men lack\nthat threatens normative competence\u2014these might be represented\nas alleged female disqualifiers. In either case, the\napologist argues, it turns out that women are naturally inferior and\nso do not deserve equal treatment.\n\nMill considers a large list of potential natural differences, not\nrestricted to deficits and disqualifiers, including claims that women\nare (1) more intuitive and practical, less principled and theoretical,\nthan men (305), (2) more focused on particulars, less capable of\nabstraction or generalization, than men (306), (3) more nervous and\nexcitable than men (308), (4) less single-minded than men (310), (5)\nless accomplished in philosophy, science, and art than men\n(313\u201314), (6) less original than men (314\u201315), (7) morally\nsuperior to men (320\u201321), (8) more susceptible to personal bias\nthan men (321), (9) more pacific and less aggressive than men\n(329\u201330), (10) more philanthropic than men (330), and (11) more\nself-sacrificing and self-abnegating than men (293).\n\nMill\u2019s response to these alleged differences is mixed.\nSometimes, he questions whether the traits in question are unevenly\ndistributed. But, for the most part, he seems to concede that the\ntraits are unevenly distributed. He doesn\u2019t always agree that\nthe female trait is a deficit or disqualifier. For instance, he thinks\nthat being more intuitive, more practical, more focused on\nparticulars, and less rigid allows women to compensate for deficits in\nthe way that men typically approach decision-making. Women are less\nlikely to follow principle for its own sake and are more likely to\ntest principles by their real world consequences. They are better able\nto multi-task and intellectually more open-minded. Being morally\nsuperior and less aggressive are unqualified goods. However, he seems\nto concede that women are more excitable, less accomplished, and less\noriginal than men. He tries to explain these deficits and\ndisqualifiers in ways that do not presuppose women\u2019s natural\ninferiority.\n\nMill\u2019s primary response to the apologists is to claim that even\nif the trait is unevenly distributed and functions as a deficit or\ndisqualifier there is nonetheless no evidence of natural inferiority.\nThere is no evidence of natural inferiority, because we cannot be sure\nthat the incapacity is the product of nature, rather than nurture. In\nparticular, because the history of sexual relations has been\ndiscriminatory, we cannot rule out the possibility that female\nincapacity is the product of past discriminatory treatment\n(275\u201377, 304\u201305, 313).\n\n\nI consider it a presumption in any one to pretend to decide what women\nare or are not, can or cannot be, by natural constitution. They have\nalways hitherto been kept, as far as regards spontaneous development,\nin so unnatural a state, that their nature cannot but have been\ngreatly distorted and disguised; and no one can safely pronounce that\nif women\u2019s nature were left to choose its direction as freely as\nmen\u2019s, and if no artificial bent were attempted to be given to\nit except that required by the conditions of human society, and given\nto both sexes alike there would be any material difference, or perhaps\nany difference at all, in the character and capacities that would\nunfold themselves. (304\u201305)\n\n\nMill rightly insists that incapacity that is the product of\ndiscriminatory treatment cannot be appealed to justify that\ndiscrimination. That would be circular reasoning.\n\nMill can explain differential accomplishments in philosophy, science,\nand the arts by appeal to social barriers to women\u2019s\nparticipation in these fields (313\u201318) and to competing domestic\ndemands that are placed on them (318\u201319). In this connection, it\nis worth noting that Mill can concede not only differential\naccomplishments of the sexes but differential capacity, in at least\none sense. For Mill can and should distinguish between actual\ncapacity and potential capacity. Actual capacities determine\nwhat an agent is now able to do, whereas potential capacities\ndetermine what actual capacities she can develop. For instance, I have\nno actual capacity to speak Russian, but presumably I do have a\npotential capacity to speak Russian. By contrast, I don\u2019t have\neven a potential capacity to fly or run a three-minute mile. Actual\ncapacities are a function of potential capacities and suitable\ntraining, opportunities, and responsibilities. If I have not been\ngiven a proper education and training with suitable deliberative\nopportunities and responsibilities at various points in my\ndevelopment, my potential competence may not be actualized. Even if\neveryone had equal potential capacities, we should expect unequal\nactual capacities in systems where education and deliberative\nopportunities and responsibilities have been distributed unequally. If\nso, then greater actual capacity would not be evidence of greater\npotential capacity.\n\nThe moral that Mill draws is that equal rights should prevail in the\nabsence of any good evidence about the way in which natural assets and\npotential capacities are distributed by gender. Equality is the\npresumption, even if it is a rebuttable presumption, and the\npresumption can only be rebutted on the basis of adequate empirical\nevidence (262).\n5.3 Is the Sexual Division of Labor Natural?\n\nIn rebutting potential defenses of sexual inequality by appeal to\nvarious alleged dimensions of natural inferiority, Mill insists that\nwe cannot determine whether traits commonly found in women are the\nproduct of nature or nurture without suitable social experimentation,\nincluding, the social experiment of sexual equality. In particular,\nthere is the very real possibility that the traits alleged to justify\nsexual discrimination are the product of past discriminatory practice.\nBut Mill does not adhere to this point consistently (see Annas 1977;\nOkin 1979: 226\u201330). At several points, he expresses the\nconviction that most women with a full menu of opportunities will\naccept a traditional sexual division of labor in which they perform\ndomestic functions while their husbands pursue professions in civil\nsociety, and he approves of this traditional division of labor.\n\n\nWhen the support of the family depends, not on property, but on\nearning, the common arrangement, by which the man earns the income and\nthe wife superintends the domestic expenditure, seems to me in general\nthe most suitable division of labor between the two persons. \u2026\nIn an otherwise just state of things, it is not, therefore, I think, a\ndesirable custom, that the wife should contribute by her labour to the\nincome of the family. (SW 297)\n\n\nOf course, Mill is right that a wife should not also have to\nearn a living outside the home if she is working full time within the\nhome. But he gives no reason for thinking that women should have\nfamilies or that, if they do, they, rather than their husbands, should\nbe responsible for matters domestic. Indeed, Mill\u2019s view seems\nto be that for women extra-domestic vocations should be reserved\nprimarily for those without children or whose children are already\ngrown (338). He seems here to assume that the traditional sexual\ndivision of labor is natural. Of course, it is possible that the\ntraditional sexual division of labor would emerge in a system of equal\nopportunity. But this is conjecture. Indeed, one might have thought\nthat his own claims about how the system of unequal opportunity has\nrepressed women\u2019s creative and managerial capacities would have\nsuggested that the traditional sexual division of labor was probably\nnot robust. In defending or at least speculating about the robustness\nof the traditional sexual division of labor, Mill appears to be\nignoring his own methodological strictures.\n5.4 Millian Feminism\n\nThis is a significant blemish on Mill\u2019s feminist credentials. He\nsometimes assumed that a traditional sexual division of labor was\nnatural in the sense that it was likely to emerge in a culture of\nequal opportunity for all. Given Mill\u2019s recognition that the\nexisting division of labor was produced and sustained in conditions of\nsexual discrimination and unequal opportunity, there is no basis for\nsupposing that this division of labor would survive a culture of\nequality. However, it is Mill himself that supplies the resources for\ncriticizing his assumption. That ought to provide partial mitigation\nof his mistake.\n\nOtherwise, Mill\u2019s feminist credentials are strong. He is a keen\ncritic of domestic and social forms of inequality, recognizing the\nharm such practices cause women and the ways in which they deform the\nlives of boys and men too. Victorian marriage law, the denial of the\nfranchise, and lack of social and economic opportunities violate\nhigher-order interests of women. These rights violations are a matter\nof serious social injustice. The corollary of these criticisms is that\nMill is a staunch defender of equal opportunity for women and an\neloquent spokesman for the way in which a culture of equality would\ntransform the lives of girls and women, liberating their creative\npotential and emotional sensibilities, and make possible more\nproductive social cooperation and friendships among equals.\n\nMill\u2019s discussion of sexual equality is one place where the\nperfectionist underpinnings of his liberal principles play an\nimportant role and add to the depth of his criticisms of sexual\ndiscrimination and his case for sexual equality. His defense of sexual\nequality highlights the genuinely progressive aspects of his\nutilitarian and liberal commitments.\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nAs perhaps the leading historical proponent of two important normative\ntraditions\u2014utilitarianism and liberalism\u2014Mill occupies an\nunusually important position in the history of western moral and\npolitical philosophy. Viewed in historical context, both\nutilitarianism and liberalism have exerted considerable progressive\ninfluence on the scope of moral concern, the design of public\ninstitutions, the responsibilities of government, and the interests\nand rights of the governed. Mill did much to articulate the\njustification, content, and implications of utilitarian and liberal\nprinciples. Inevitably, there are questions about the proper\ninterpretation, adequacy, and consistency of his various claims on\nthese topics. But he has left an enduring legacy in both utilitarian\nand liberal traditions. Both traditions figure centrally in\ncontemporary discussions of analytical ethical and political theory.\nFurther progress in these traditions must take account of his\ncontributions.\nA Note on Texts and References\n\nReferences to Mill\u2019s texts and other historical texts will be by\ntitle or short title; references to contemporary articles and books\nwill be by year of publication.
