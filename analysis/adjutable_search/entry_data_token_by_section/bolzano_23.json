    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n6. Aesthetics\n\nBolzano published two treatises in aesthetics: \u201cOn the Concept\nof the Beautiful\u201d (Bolzano 1843b) appeared while he was alive,\nwhile the other one, entitled \u201cOn the Division of the Fine\nArts\u201d (Bolzano 1849b), was presented by him in the Royal\nBohemian Society of Sciences in 1847 but was published only\nposthumously.\n\nIn the first of these two aesthetic essays Bolzano proposes the\nfollowing definition of the concept of the beautiful:\n\nThe beautiful must be an object whose contemplation can give to all\nhuman beings properly developed in their cognitive faculties a\npleasure, and the reason for this is that, upon apprehending some of\nthe object\u2019s properties, neither is it too easy for them nor\ndoes it cause for them the effort of distinct thinking, to form a\nconcept of this object which allows them to guess the other properties\nthat are apprehended only by further contemplation and thereby gives\nthem at least an obscure intuition of the proficiency of their\ncognitive faculties (Bolzano 1843b, 27 and 30).\n\n\nIt is hard to see how, according to this definition, there could be\nbeautiful objects if there did not exist certain human dispositions;\nand, obviously, there can be human dispositions only if there are\nhuman beings. Bolzano\u2019s definition seems therefore to make\nbeauty ontologically dependent on the existence of human beings as\npossible beholders of beautiful objects. This makes Bolzano\u2019s\naesthetics in a certain sense subjectivist. By taking Bolzano\u2019s\ndefinition to be a conditional definition in today\u2019s sense, we\ncould avoid this consequence; but in this case beauty would not be\ndefined for a world without human beings, and in such a world there\nwere no beautiful objects. Bolzano himself, however, did not draw such\nconclusions from his definition, but quite on the contrary: He claimed\nexplicitly that there would be beautiful objects in the world even if\nno human being existed (Bolzano 1843b,\u00a0 67). Be that as it may,\nBolzano does by no means advocate an extreme form of subjectivism in\naesthetics. For him, the beauty of an object depends also, and even\nprimarily, on certain inner properties, in particular on certain\nregularities of the object itself which give rise to its possible\neffects on the beholders. This puts Bolzano\u2019s basic aesthetic\nview in a middle position between extreme subjectivism and extreme\nobjectivism. In any case, Bolzano\u2019s essay on the concept of the\nbeautiful includes a quite subtle psychological analysis of phenomena\nthat are relevant for aesthetics and play an important role in\ntoday\u2019s aesthetic research.\n\nIn his second aesthetic treatise (Bolzano 1849b), Bolzano explains his\nunderstanding of fine arts and of works of fine art, and he presents a\nclassification of fine arts based on an ontological analysis of the\nworks of fine art.\n",
