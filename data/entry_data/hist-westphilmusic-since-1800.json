    "main_text": "\n1. Nineteenth Century\n1.1 Romantic Musical Aesthetics\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, a new aesthetic sensibility\nemerges in Europe. The imitation of nature loses ground to new values\nsuch as the expression of feelings and the autonomy of art. No longer\nconfined to the imitation of the sensible world, art is conceived as a\nway to attain knowledge of a transcendent reality. This shift in\nattitude is of paramount importance for the position of music among\nthe arts. If the eighteenth century had struggled to fit the growing\ninstrumental repertoire into the clothes of imitation, the Romantics\nproclaimed music\u2019s superiority precisely in virtue of its\nabsolute nature. And while the early modern period had occasionally\ntouted the pleasures of listening, the Romantics raised the bar,\nstressing that music\u2019s value is not primarily hedonic, but\nrather cognitive.\n\nThe rise of this new musical aesthetics is particularly evident in the\nworks of Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder (1773\u20131798). His\nFantasies on Art for Friends of Art [Phantasien \u00fcber\ndie Kunst f\u00fcr Freunde der Kunst] (1799), while unsystematic\nand lacking argumentation, is rich in suggestions. For instance, we\nfind in it a tell-tale comparison between music and the visual arts.\nThe latter can at best aim at a convincing imitation of natural\nobjects, though their productions hardly compare to the beauty of\nnature. Not so with music, as natural sounds have little value when\ncompared to musical tones, since these\n\n\nare of an entirely different nature; they don\u2019t imitate, they\ndon\u2019t beautify, but rather represent a separate world in itself.\n(Wackenroder 1799: 241, my translation)\n\n\nIf music does not deal with the world as we know it from ordinary\nperception, but rather with a transcendent reality, then language will\nfail to describe music effectively. This is what we could call the\nineffability thesis, which emerges in various forms in the\nwritings of Romantic philosophers, critics, and musicians. The view is\nconveyed not so much by the weak claim that we do not currently have\nwords to name what music means or expresses, but rather by the\nstronger claim that we could not possibly find them. While it is\nperhaps Arthur Schopenhauer who is responsible for the most\ninfluential philosophical account of ineffability (see following\nsection), the composer Felix Mendelssohn (1809\u20131847) gives the\nineffability thesis its most famous formulation when he states\nthat\n\n\n[t]he thoughts which are expressed to me by a piece of music which I\nlove are not too indefinite to be put into words, but on the contrary\ntoo definite. (letter to Marc-Andr\u00e9 Souchay 15 October 1842,\nquoted in Fubini 1991: 307)\n\n\nThe composer and historian of music August Wilhelm Ambros\n(1816\u20131876), further away from the heyday of the Romantic\nmovement, makes a somewhat weaker claim:\n\n\nPoetry, much like music, is able to express feelings, for which it\nwould be almost impossible to find a corresponding term. (Ambros 1885:\n70, my translation)\n\n\nThe ineffability thesis was put into question around the middle of the\ncentury by the growing support for formalist tendencies, which saw in\nour inability to name the feelings expressed by music a symptom of its\nexpressive poverty (see\n \u00a71.6).\n\nPrecisely because of its strikingly Romantic tinge, it is tempting to\nbrush off the ineffability thesis as a historical curiosity. However,\nit is worth noting that the rejection of language as a model for the\nunderstanding of music is a move that allows us to look at music as a\nsymbol in its own right, with its own syntactic and semantic rules.\nFubini writes:\n\n\nInstrumental music had always been charged with indeterminacy; yet it\nis only indeterminate when it is viewed from the standpoint of verbal\nlanguage. Herein lies the great discovery of the Romantic thinkers,\nthat the idiom of music is of a quite different order, and is to be\nmeasured with an entirely different yardstick. (Fubini 1991: 266)\n\n\nFar from being confined to a Romantic curiosity, the difference\nbetween language and music qua symbol systems will be\nexplored in the twentieth century by proponents of semiotic approaches\nsuch as Susanne Langer and Nelson Goodman (see\n \u00a72.3).\n\nWackenroder also voices another typically Romantic view, according to\nwhich the emotions expressed by an artwork bear a relation to the ones\nfelt by the artist as she composed the work. In Wackenroder\u2019s\nOutpourings of an Art-Loving Monk [Herzensergiessungen\neines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders] (1797), the fictional Joseph\nBerglinger\n\n\nfilled his soul with the most sublime poetry, with a full and exultant\nhymn, and, in a marvelous inspiration, but still violently shaken\nemotionally, he set down a passion music which, with its deeply\naffecting melodies, embodying all the pains of suffering, will forever\nremain a masterpiece. (Wackenroder 1797 [1950: 762])\n\n\nIn its strongest formulation, this view holds that a work of music\nbeing sad, happy, and the like, requires the author to have been in\nthat emotional state when composing the work. This is known today as\nexpression theory (for a classic exposition, see Abrams 1971:\nchapter 4), and is sometimes paired with the further claim that, upon\nappreciating the work, one will be put in an emotional state similar\nto the artist\u2019s. Although it is now largely discredited (Tormey\n1971; Budd 1985: chapter 7), the expression theory is a paradigmatic\nview of artistic production as (emotional) communication between two\nindividuals. Wackenroder, again through the character of Berglinger,\nis comforted by the thought that\n\n\nthere may be someone whom Heaven has made so sympathetic to my soul\nthat he will feel on hearing my melodies precisely what I felt in\nwriting them\u2014precisely what I sought to put in them.\n(Wackenroder 1797 [1950: 759])\n\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770\u20131827), is arguably the most important\ncomposer who described his compositional practice in ways that are\nsuggestive of the expression theory:\n\n\n[\u2026] like the poet who is inspired by the feelings that he\ntransmutes into words, I too am inspired to turn my feelings into the\nmusic that sounds within me and torments me until finally it has been\nput down in notes on the sheet of paper in front of me. (Beethoven\n1961, quoted in Fubini 1991: 288)\n\n\nWackenroder\u2019s writings already show evidence of the change in\nattitude toward instrumental music. Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann\n(1776\u20131822), a writer, composer, and critic, is a crucial figure\nin this process. The start of his essay Beethoven\u2019s\nInstrumental Music (1813) is a quintessential expression of the\nRomantic conception of music:\n\n\nWhen we speak of music as an independent art, should we not always\nrestrict our meaning to instrumental music, which, scorning every aid,\nevery admixture of another art (the art of poetry), gives pure\nexpression to music\u2019s specific nature, recognizable in this form\nalone? It is the most romantic of all the arts\u2014one might almost\nsay, the only genuinely romantic one\u2014for its sole subject is the\ninfinite. (Hoffman 1813 [1950: 775])\n\n\nThe glorification of instrumental music is paired with the\ncondemnation of imitation. Extra-musical imagery, however, is not\naltogether banned, at least on the listener\u2019s side: much like\nWackenroder, Hoffmann helps himself to fanciful descriptions of music,\nand uses these in order to bring out the differences among the three\ngreatest representatives of the Viennese School. Thus, Haydn\n\u201cleads us into vast green woodlands\u201d (Hoffman 1813 [1950\n[776]), Mozart \u201cleads us into the heart of the spirit\nrealm\u201d (1813 [1950: 777]), whereas Beethoven\u2019s\ninstrumental music \u201copens up to us also the realm of the\nmonstrous and the immeasurable\u201d (1813 [1950: 777]).\nHoffman\u2019s essay also contains a version of the ineffability\nthesis:\n\n\nmusic discloses to man an unknown realm, a world that has nothing in\ncommon with the external sensual words that surrounds him, a world in\nwhich he leaves behind him all definite feelings to surrender himself\nto an inexpressible longing. (Hoffman 1813 [1950: 775\u2013776])\n\n\nWhile many of these claims are advanced by early Romantics without\nmuch argumentative support, at least some of these views are given a\nmore systematic defense by Schopenhauer.\n1.2 Romantic Metaphysics of Music: Schopenhauer\n\nThe art of music occupies a central place in Arthur\nSchopenhauer\u2019s (1788\u20131860) philosophical system, with\nwhich it is inextricably linked. A brief overview of\nSchopenhauer\u2019s system is thus in order. He accepts the Kantian\ndistinction between the world as it is in itself and as it appears to\nus, but rejects Kant\u2019s claim that we cannot know reality as it\nis independently from its phenomenal manifestation. As representing\nsubjects, our knowledge is bound by what Schopenhauer terms\nprincipium individuationis, which orders representations\naccording to a spatio-temporal structure and determines causal\nrelationships between them. Objects are thus given to us in a mediated\nfashion, as representations. But one object is given to us as\nexperiencing subjects both in a mediated and in an unmediated fashion.\nThis is our own body, which is experienced both from the outside, as a\nrepresentation, and from the inside, as an incessant succession of\ndrives and impulses. Schopenhauer claims that this reveals the\nfundamental noumenal essence of the world as Will. Since the Will is\nendless striving and desiring, and since desiring and striving are by\nnature sources of pain, the world is essentially characterized by\nsuffering. Additionally, Schopenhauer claims that the Will objectifies\nitself in the world through a set of Platonic Ideas, which exist\nbeyond the principium individuationis, and are ranked\naccording to the degree in which the Will is objectivized in them.\n\nIn Schopenhauer\u2019s system, art acquires its value from its\ncapacity to represent the Ideas, exploiting a form of cognition that\nis different from rational and intellectual cognition, which by nature\ncannot go beyond the principium individuationis. This\ncognition is valuable because it removes us from the network of\ndeterministically linked representations and motives that constitute\nour ordinary existence in the thralls of our desires and longings.\n\nSchopenhauer ranks the various arts according to the Ideas they\nrepresent. The higher the degree of objectivation of the Will in a\ngiven Idea, the higher the hierarchical position of the art\nrepresenting that Idea. Accordingly, architecture is found at the\nbottom of the hierarchy, as it deals with the Ideas of basic physical\nforces and inanimate matter, whereas tragedy occupies the highest\nposition, as it represents the struggles of the human condition, where\nthe Will is most evidently manifest.\n\nIn this hierarchy of the arts, music\u2019s value is superior even to\nthat of tragedy. According to Schopenhauer, music is not a\nrepresentation of Ideas, but rather of the Will itself. Music and the\nworld are expressions of the same metaphysical principle, the Will.\nThis motivates Schopenhauer\u2019s remark that music could exist even\nif there were no world at all (1819: \u00a752). If music is an\nexpression of the Will just as the world is, and given that the Will\nobjectifies itself in the world through the Platonic Ideas, one can\ntrace a parallel between music and degrees of objectivation of the\nWill. Particularly, Schopenhauer sets up an analogy between pitch\nrange and degrees of objectivation. Thus, the lowest areas of the\naudible pitch range are associated with the lowest degrees, such as\ninorganic nature and physical forces, whereas the higher regions of\nthe pitch range match with the highest level of objectivation of the\nWill, self-conscious human beings. Schopenhauer motivates this\nanalysis through a rather audacious interpretation of both acoustics\nand music theory. This series of correspondences between music and the\nextra-musical world is reminiscent of the Pythagorean notion of\ncelestial harmony (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 1.1).\n Schopenhauer questionably and conveniently identifies high pitch with\nmelody. This is questionable because the melodic element in music is\nnot determined by pitch range, but rather by relational properties,\nnor is a melody always composed of the highest notes in a given piece.\nIt is convenient, because the parallel between pitch range and degrees\nof objectivation allows Schopenhauer to consider the unfolding of a\nmelody as analogous to human emotional life. Much as human life is\ncharacterized by an alternation of need and satisfaction, melodies\nfeature continuous shifts from tension to relaxation. The emotions we\nencounter in music have a peculiar status: they are neither\nparticular, for they are beyond the principium\nindividuationis, nor general, as they are not abstracted from\nparticular cases as concepts are, and cannot therefore be captured\nlinguistically.\n\nIt should be stressed that, according to Schopenhauer, music does not\narouse such emotions in the listener, and if it did, it would\nnot be valuable on those grounds. In fact, the value of music resides\nexactly in its capacity to present us with the Will in its highest\ndegree of objectivation, without having to experience its stirrings\nourselves\u2014the latter experience would be an inherently\nunpleasant one, according to Schopenhauer. The value of music as art\nis thus, according to Schopenhauer, eminently cognitive.\n\nFrom this view of music, some normative consequences follow. First,\nbecause the analogy between music and the world depends on their being\nexpressions of the same metaphysical Will, and because the Will lies\nbeyond the scope of conceptual knowledge, Schopenhauer condemns\nimitative music, as this depicts the world by imitating its sonic\nappearance to a subject, rather than its inner essence. Second,\nbecause the knowledge provided by music is superior to discursive\nknowledge, Schopenhauer dismisses works and genres in which the music\nis subservient to the lyrics. Third, because Schopenhauer holds the\nmusic\u2019s melodic element to be central to its value, he is\ndismissive of music in which melody is inconspicuous (\u201cIn the\ncompositions of today there is more emphasis on the harmony than the\nmelody; I however take the opposite view and regard melody as the core\nof music, to which harmony relates as does sauce to a roast\u201d\nSchopenhauer 1851: chapter 19, \u00a7 219).\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s view of music influenced a number of composers.\nHis impact on Richard Wagner could hardly have been greater (see\n \u00a71.4;\n Magee 1997: chapter 17; Karnes & Mitchell 2020; on\nSchopenhauer\u2019s musical aesthetics, see Alperson 1981; Budd 1985:\nchapter 5; Wicks 2008: 106\u2013111).\n1.3 Idealist Musical Aesthetics: Schelling and Hegel\n\nMusic\u2019s rise to prominence among the arts is signaled by the\nincreasing number of major philosophers who find space for it in their\nsystems. These include Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling\n(1775\u20131854) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831).\nThe greatest contribution of idealist philosophy to the aesthetics of\nmusic is perhaps the idea that music\u2019s temporal nature is\ncrucial to its peculiar status among the arts (see Johnson 1991:\n159).\n\nSchelling developed his philosophy of art in a series of lectures he\ngave in the years 1802\u201303 and 1804\u201305, although the result\nof these efforts was published only posthumously in 1859. He conceives\nof art as the manifestation of the Infinite in the Finite, and divides\nthe arts into formative (bildende, often rendered as\n\u201cfigurative\u201d) and verbal (redende). Formative\narts function by manipulating their characteristic material, that is,\ntheir medium, whereas verbal arts convey content semantically. Music\nbelongs to the formative arts, alongside painting and sculpture.\nSchelling distinguishes three elements in music: rhythm, modulation\n(harmony), and melody. On these he projects the triad of the formative\narts, claiming that rhythm is the musical in music, modulation the\npainterly, and melody the sculptural. As this suggests, Schelling\nbelieves rhythm, and more generally music\u2019s temporal dimension,\nto be of fundamental importance. Music\u2019s necessary form is\ntemporal succession. Rhythm allows us to perceive a multiplicity of\ntemporally contiguous moments as a unity, and thereby performs a\nfunction similar to that of self-consciousness, which allows us to\nperceive various experiences as a unified whole (Schelling 1859:\n\u00a779).\n\nSimilar ideas are developed in more rigorous and systematic fashion by\nHegel, whose reflections on music are embedded in an articulated\nsystem of the arts (see Moland 2019: chapter 9). This system is itself\nrelated to a historical analysis of art\u2019s development, which in\nturn is grounded in an idealist metaphysics. According to Hegel,\nreality coincides with a self-determining spiritual principle, or Idea\n(Idee). The Idea develops historically through branching\ntriadic patterns constituted by a thesis, or positive moment, its\nnegation or antithesis, and a synthesis of the two. Each moment may\nitself branch into a further triadic pattern, which is thus nested\nunder the higher-order ones. The highest forms of development of the\nIdea involve self-conscious Spirit (Geist), as we find it in\nhuman life and society. Spirit\u2019s third moment is absolute\nspirit, which in turn branches into art, religion, and philosophy, the\nlatter being the culmination of the Idea\u2019s unfolding.\nArt\u2019s relative proximity to philosophy is an indication of its\nrelatively high value in Hegel\u2019s eyes, and its contiguity to\nreligion will mean that at least some art will share some features\nwith religion. Whereas philosophy expresses the Spirit through\nconcepts, and religion does so through metaphors and representations,\nart is the sensuous expression of the Spirit\u2019s freedom. Beauty\nis thus defined as \u201cthe pure appearance of the Idea to\nsense\u201d (Hegel 1835: part I, chapter I, 3).\n\nAccording to Hegel, art may be further analyzed in terms of a triadic\nstructure, in such a way that we may distinguish its development\nthrough symbolic, classical, and romantic art. Hegel\u2019s system of\nthe individual arts is dependent on this historical unfolding, as the\nvarious art forms are differently suited to each of the three stages.\nSymbolic art falls short of art proper, and is in fact described by\nHegel as pre-art (Vorkunst), as it limits itself to offering\nsymbols of the Spirit, as opposed to giving an adequate sensory\npresentation of its freedom. Classical art is art at its fullest, as\nit gives a perfectly adequate sensuous presentation of the spiritual.\nHegel holds that this is best exemplified by classical Greek art, and\nparticularly sculpture. Romantic art (by which Hegel means Christian\nart from the Middle Ages onwards) is characterized by the expression\nof a content that transcends the visible realm, since it expresses an\ninward freedom, as opposed to an external one. Hegel writes:\n\n\nThe true content of romantic art is absolute inwardness, and its\ncorresponding form is spiritual subjectivity with its grasp of its\nindependence and freedom. (Hegel 1835: part II, section III,\nIntroduction, 2)\n\n\nThis content will then best be represented by religion, which follows\nart in the triadic sequence.\n\nBecause romantic art\u2019s content is inward freedom, sculpture is\nno longer adequate, as it is bound to the representation of\nthree-dimensional figures. Painting, however, abandons the third\ndimension, and is further able to express interiority through the use\nof color. But in subjective inwardness the spatial dimension is\naltogether absent. Its only appreciable dimension is that of the\ntemporal unfolding of our mental life, characterized by the rapid\nsuccession of states that replace one another in our consciousness.\nMusic is the art that is best suited to the expression of this inward\ndimension, as it abandons spatial extension entirely, and develops\nsolely through time. Music is thus the art form that is best suited to\nromantic art.\n\nThe perception of one\u2019s own persistence through time requires\ndiscrete events that break the otherwise continuous and identical\nstream of temporality. This is achieved in music through meter and\nrhythm, which subdivide the music\u2019s unfolding in ordered,\ndiscrete units. Harmony fills in this abstract structure with notes.\nMelody, which Hegel conceives of as a synthesis of rhythm and harmony,\nis the highest manifestation of music, \u201cthe sphere of its\nproperly artistic inventions\u201d (Hegel 1835: part III, section\nIII, chapter II, 2.c).\n\nMelody allows music to give sensuous manifestation to the freedom of\nthe Spirit by presenting feelings in their temporal unfolding. Hegel\ndoes not say much as to how melody achieves its expressive task. He\ncontrasts expression in music and painting, claiming that only the\nlatter is concerned with the exact reproduction of expressive\nbehavior. However, some kind of imitation of human expressions still\nseems to play a role in Hegel\u2019s account, as he then adds that in\nmusic\n\n\nthe simple cry is analysed into a series of notes, into a movement,\nthe change and course of which is supported by harmony and rounded\ninto whole by melody. (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II,\n3.a)\n\n\nThis framework allows Hegel to develop an original argument in support\nof the otherwise commonplace view that music moves us. The self is\nconstituted in time, and musical sounds exist in time. It is this\ncommon medium that allows music to exert such a powerful effect on our\nemotional life (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II, 1.c).\nPoetry shares with music its temporal and aural dimension, but it\nseparates medium from content, as the concepts conveyed by a poem are\narbitrarily linked to the words that constitute it, whereas\nmusic\u2019s content is inseparable from its sounding (Hegel 1835:\npart III, section III, chapter II, 1.a).\n\nHegel distinguishes between accompanying and independent music. To the\nformer belongs any work that involves music and a text, whereas the\nlatter is instrumental music. When music functions as an\naccompaniment, Hegel holds that the text should be subordinate to the\nmusic (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II, 3). Independent\nmusic is music at its full potential, as it is best able to express\nthe freedom of the Spirit, for subjective experience unfolds\nundetermined by concepts (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter\nII, 3.b). However, independent music also harbors a potential danger,\nas it may be tempted to rely on its formal complexity and forego\nemotional content entirely, in which case it would strictly speaking\ncease to be art (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II, 1.b).\nHere Hegel pairs a Romantic vindication of instrumental music as music\npar excellence with an eighteenth century suspicion of music\nthat is not expressive of emotions.\n\nThe originality of Hegel\u2019s musical thinking is also manifested\nin the few considerations he devotes to the role of the performer.\nThese are introduced and motivated by an observation on the mode of\nexistence peculiar to musical works: while in painting and sculpture\nwe appreciate the product of an activity, in music we appreciate the\nprocess of production (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II,\n3.c). Hegel then distinguishes two approaches to performance. The\nfirst relinquishes personal contributions on the part of the\nperformer, and seeks to render the work as faithfully as possible,\nwhereas the second allows the performer some initiative (Hegel 1835:\npart III, section III, chapter II, 3.c). Hegel claims that the two\napproaches bear a relation to accompanying and independent music,\nrespectively, but does not imply that each approach is best suited to\nits corresponding kind of music.\n1.4 Music and Drama: Wagner\n\nRichard Wagner (1813\u20131883) is the most important major Western\ncomposer to have left a sizable body of philosophical writings on\nmusic. In addition to the intrinsic interest of his own views and\ntheir relation to the composer\u2019s musical production,\nWagner\u2019s place in the history of the philosophy of music is\nsecured by the influence Schopenhauer exercised on him, and by the one\nhe in turn had on another major philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche (see\n \u00a71.2\n and\n \u00a71.5).\n\nDespite the vast literature on Wagner\u2019s music, relatively few\nworks take seriously the philosophical details of his writings, and\nsome are openly dismissive of his undeniably meandering, rhetorically\ncharged prose (see for instance Fubini 1991: 325; significant works on\nWagner\u2019s philosophy and aesthetics are Grey 1995, Magee 2000,\nand Young 2014).\n\nWagner\u2019s first substantial theoretical contributions are the\nso-called Zurich writings (1849\u201352), from the name of the city\nwhere he spent his exile for having taken part in the 1848 revolution,\npolitical movements inspired by democratic and liberal ideals. In\nthese works, Wagner objects to the current state of art in society,\nand argues that only a new kind of artwork, a \u201ctotal\u201d\nartwork (Gesamtkunstwerk) uniting the various art forms,\ncould reestablish art\u2019s role as the \u201cliving utterance of a\nfree, self-conscious community\u201d (Wagner 1849a [1892: 41]).\nAccording to Wagner, contemporary art is enslaved to either political\nor financial power. It will become a genuine expression of the\ncommunity that produces it only after its liberation from the\nconstraints imposed by both the government and the market. Thus,\nWagner claims in Art and Revolution (1849) that art is not\nessentially revolutionary, although it need be revolutionary given the\ncurrent conditions, \u201cbecause its very existence is opposed to\nthe ruling spirit of the community\u201d (Wagner 1849a [1892:\n52]).\n\nWagner\u2019s paradigm of the total artwork is the Greek tragic\nfestival. While he does not call for its literal restoration, Wagner\nargues that the artwork of the future should be like the Greek one in\nsome crucial respects. It should involve all strata of society (Wagner\n1849a; Wagner 1852b: part II, 2). Most famously, it should unite the\nvarious art forms (Wagner 1849a; Wagner 1849b: IV). Aside from his\nreliance on the authority of the Greek model, at least two additional\nargument are advanced by Wagner in support of the\nGesamtkunstwerk. First, Wagner argues that its multi-sensory\nnature is best apt to give rise to an immersive, lifelike experience\n(Wagner 1852b: part II, 2; for discussion, see Young 2014:\n46\u201348). Second, Wagner holds that an art is unfree\n(unfrei) when in isolation, free when it cooperates with\nother art forms (Wagner 1849b: II, 2). The argument seems to rely on\nan analogy with human freedom, which Wagner conceived as possible only\nfor an individual who is part of a collective. In both cases, absence\nof limitations is equated with an absence of freedom.\n\nWagner\u2019s admiration for Greek tragedy is only superficially\nsimilar to the Camerata\u2019s attempt to revive it (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 3.2).\n In Opera and Drama (1852), he argues that opera\u2019s\nfundamental mistake has been that of subordinating opera\u2019s end\n(drama) to its means (music). He then describes opera as misguided\nfrom its very origins in Italy (Wagner 1852b: Introduction).\n\nIn 1854 Wagner encountered for the first time the work of Arthur\nSchopenhauer. This produced a decisive and immediate influence on\nWagner\u2019s worldview, which in turn had an impact on his musical\nproduction and theoretical works. Although Wagner\u2019s late\nwritings are less systematic than those of 1849\u201352, a new view\nof music and drama finds expression in his essay Beethoven\n(1870) and in The Destiny of Opera (1871).\n\nIn the Beethoven essay, Wagner describes Schopenhauer as the first\nphilosopher who gave a clear treatment of music\u2019s place among\nthe arts. Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy of music gives a privileged\nstatus to pure instrumental music (see\n \u00a71.2),\n an assumption that contrasts with Wagner\u2019s central commitment\nto a union of the arts, as well as with his related reservations about\nmusic alone. Under Schopenhauer\u2019s influence, the late Wagner\nsurrenders some central points of his earlier view, as evident from\nhis claim that \u201ca piece of music loses nothing of its character\neven when the most diverse texts are laid beneath it\u201d, and the\nsubsequent contention that the union of music and poetry always\nresults in the subordination of the latter (Wagner 1870 [1896: 104).\nThis stands in stark contrast with Wagner\u2019s earlier\ncharacterization of melody as an element that should not attract the\nlistener\u2019s attention, functioning merely as \u201cthe most\nexpressive vehicle for an emotion already plainly outlined in the\nwords\u201d (Wagner 1851 1852a: 372). Wagner denies a contradiction\nbetween his earlier and late views, although Young (2014:\n101\u2013107) notes that changes are evident both from Wagner\u2019s\nwritings as well as from the musical production that follows his\nencounter with Schopenhauer\u2014especially the three works in the\nRing cycle that follow Das Rheingold.\n1.5 Nietzsche\n\nThe main elements of Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s (1844\u20131900)\nmusical aesthetics are laid out in his first book, The Birth of\nTragedy (1872), which bears the clear influence of Schopenhauer\nand is dedicated to Wagner. The book describes the world as torn\nbetween two tendencies or principles, the Apollonian and the\nDionysian.\n\nThe Apollonian element is the rational view of reality as subject to\nthe principium individuationis, a concept that Nietzsche\nborrows from Schopenhauer (see\n \u00a71.2).\n While ultimately an illusion, the Apollonian order of reality is\nnecessary to the formation of any civilization. In opposition to the\nApollonian, the Dionysian is the awareness of the fundamental unity of\nall beings, again in analogy with Schopenhauer\u2019s metaphysical\nWill. If the former impulse is expressed in peaceful contemplation,\nthe latter is manifested in states of ecstatic frenzy, which ought\nhowever to be contained in order to spare individuals and\ncivilizations from self-destruction. According to Nietzsche, only in\nthe balance between the two tendencies is life bearable.\n\nIn this picture, the arts differ in to the degree to which they embody\none of these two tendencies. Sculpture is the Apollonian art par\nexcellence, while music possesses to the highest degree the\nDionysian component. The reasons for the identification of music as\nDionysian are complex to reconstruct. Sorgner (20003 [2010:\n147\u2013149]) isolates three: (1) music relies on an experience of\nflow and temporal change; (2) music represents pain and strife through\nits use of dissonances; (3) music induces states of intoxication and\nself-forgetfulness through which we experience the fundamental unity\nof the world.\n\nGreek tragedy is characterized by Nietzsche as the supreme artistic\nachievement because it expresses both tendencies. This, at least, is\ntrue of Aeschylus\u2019 and Sophocles\u2019 tragedies. Euripides,\ninfluenced by Socratic rationalism, expunged the Dionysian element\nfrom tragedy. Once tragedy lost its Dionysian element, it was also\ndeprived of its redeeming power. According to Nietzsche,\nWagner\u2019s operas are to be credited for having brought back the\nsynthesis of Apollonian and Dionysian elements, and thus to have made\nagain available the redeeming power of the Greek tragedy.\n\nThe second part of The Birth of Tragedy is wedded to the\nWagnerian agenda to such an extent that is has been defined as\n\u201cby far the most ambitious defence of an individual artist ever\nmounted by a philosopher\u201d (Ridley 2007: 31). Despite\nNietzsche\u2019s early enthusiastic endorsement of Wagner\u2019s\nwork, his infatuation with the composer soon began to fade, and\nfinally turned into outright condemnation (on Nietzsche\u2013Wagner\nrelations, see Ridley 2007: appendix; Young 2014: epilogue; Prange\n2013: chapters 1\u20136). While the reasons for this are complex, it\nseems clear that Wagner\u2019s failure to embody the values of truly\nDionysian music was crucial. This failure depended not only on\nWagner\u2019s own stylistic development, but also on\nNietzsche\u2019s reconsideration of the composer\u2019s earlier\nachievement. Nietzsche later contrasts German and Romantic music with\nDionysian music, which clashes with Nietzsche\u2019s own earlier\ncharacterization of German music, and especially Wagner\u2019s, as\ntruly Dionysian (Nietzsche 1872: \u00a719; about the contrast between\nDionysian and Romantic art more generally, see Ridley 2007:\n122\u2013128). In Beyond Good and Evil (1886), Nietzsche\ncontrasts the decadent music of the North to that of the South,\nepitomized by Bizet\u2019s work, the chief value of which lies in its\nlife-affirming quality (Nietzsche 1886: \u00a7554).\n\nAs is apparent from the above, Nietzsche\u2019s evaluation of musical\nstyles changed along with his philosophical views. Concrete examples\nof music he praises vary from Wagner\u2019s Tristan and\nIsolde to Bizet\u2019s Carmen. The clearest set of\nevaluative claims is found in The Birth of Tragedy, where\nopposition emerges between Apollonian and Dionysian music. The latter\nis obviously considered by Nietzsche as superior to the former, as he\ndefines music as the art in which the Dionysian is present in the\nhighest degree. Nietzsche offers little in terms of a clear\ndistinction between the two, but he seems to think of Dionysian music\nas privileging melodic and harmonic components, whereas Apollonian\nmusic stresses rhythmical ones. Two other elements of\nNietzsche\u2019s view of music can be singled out, and\nSchopenhauer\u2019s influence on both is evident. First, Nietzsche\nbelieves that music should never be subservient to a text (Nietzsche\n1872: \u00a719). Secondly, Nietzsche holds that music ought to avoid\ntone-painting, which is merely an imitation of the world\u2019s\nappearance (Nietzsche 1872: \u00a717). But if Nietzsche\u2019s early\nmusical aesthetics is close to Schopenhauer in his negative\ncharacterization of what is valuable in music, his positive notion of\nmusical value departs significantly from Schopenhauer\u2019s, as\nNietzsche holds that music\u2019s value is partly to be located in\nits capacity to arouse emotions or induce a certain psychological\nstate (Nietzsche 1872: \u00a72).\n\nIt is more daunting a task to reconstruct Nietzsche\u2019s views on\nmusic after The Birth of Tragedy. In addition to the already\nmentioned distancing from Wagner, a relevant change in\nNietzsche\u2019s view is found in some remarks from Human, All\nToo Human (1878), which constitute a wholesale rejection of his\nearlier views concerning the relationship between music and language.\nIn this work, musical meaning and expressiveness are described as a\nproduct of music\u2019s longstanding association with poetic language\nand expressive gestures (Nietzsche 1878: \u00a7 215\u201316). Only\nthrough these associations is it possible for instrumental music to\nacquire meaning:\n\n\nNo music is in itself profound and meaningful, it does not speak of\nthe \u201cwill\u201d or of the \u201cthing in itself\u201d.\n(Nietzsche 1878 [1996]: \u00a7 215; on Nietzsche\u2019s late musical\naesthetics, see Higgins 1986; Young 1992: chapters 3\u20135; and\nPrange 2013: chapter 6)\n\n1.6 Absolute Music and the Rise of Formalism\n\nThe nineteenth century witnessed the first explicit vindications of\nabsolute music as an aesthetic ideal (for a history of this concept,\nsee Dahlhaus 1978 [1989], Pederson 2009, and Bonds 2014). The term was\nfirst used in 1846 by Wagner, who then employed it pejoratively in his\n1849\u201351 writings in order to refer to music lacking any\nessential social function\u2014in this sense, music is absolute\ninsofar as it is socially autonomous (on Wagner\u2019s uses of\n\u201cabsolute music\u201d, see Grey 1995: 2; Chua 1999: 225;\nPederson 2009: 241\u2013245; Bonds 2014: 134 ff.). Wagner\u2019s\nopponents appropriated the term in this second sense, to denote music\nthat is not accompanied by a text, program, or other conceptual\nprompts. In this sense, the symphony was considered the paradigmatic\nexample of absolute music (see Dahlhaus 1978 [1989: 10\u201311]).\nAbsolute music is thus purely instrumental music\u2014this is also\nhow the expression is typically used today. The concept of absolute\nmusic may be used in a purely descriptive fashion: it denotes a subset\nof all musical works. However, nineteenth century aesthetics often\nadopted a normative view of absolute music as purely instrumental\nmusic. The view holds that music\u2019s value is irreducible to that\nof other art forms, and that instrumental music is valuable for its\nformal properties, rather than for any content it may disclose (if it\ncan do so in the first place), or feelings it may arouse. This is\nmusical formalism.\n\nWhile Kant was likely not a formalist (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 3.6),\n Young (2020: 180) observes that he was considered one from as early\nas the 1820s, as evident from the work of the Swiss composer\nHans-Georg N\u00e4geli (1773\u20131836). N\u00e4geli gives early\nformulations of various standard formalist views. He argues that music\ndoes not have any determinate emotional character, as shown by the\nfact that people cannot agree on it if asked. Accordingly, music does\nnot convey specific affects (Affekten), but merely moods\n(Stimmungen). It does not have any content (Inhalt),\nbut merely form (Form) (N\u00e4geli 1826: 32).\n\nIn addition to Kant\u2019s aesthetics (or at least their\ninterpretation of it), formalists could count on the support of a\nmajor philosopher, Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776\u20131841), who\nadopted an influential and undeniably formalist view of art. He\ndefended the specificity of each art form, and distinguished the\neffects of the beautiful from the beautiful itself, the latter being\nthe proper object of aesthetic appreciation.\n\nTo N\u00e4geli and Herbart is indebted the greatest representative of\nmusical formalism, Eduard Hanslick (1825\u20131904) (for a discussion\nof Hanslick\u2019s forerunners, see Bonds 2014: 157 ff.; Wilfing 2018\ndebunks the widespread view that Kant exercised a decisive influence\non Hanslick).\n\nHanslick\u2019s brief treatise On the Musically Beautiful\n(1854) is one of the most influential works in history of musical\naesthetics. The work gives a concise and persuasive formulation of the\ncardinal tenets of formalism. The book opens with a series of\narguments against what he calls \u201cthe aesthetics of\nfeeling\u201d (Hanslick 1854 [2018]: chapter 1). This is the Romantic\nconception of music as concerned with the representation and arousal\nof emotions. The negative part of Hanslick\u2019s work establishes\nthat music cannot represent feelings, and that music\u2019s arousal\nof feelings, while possible, is irrelevant to its aesthetic\nappreciation. Hanslick\u2019s positive thesis is that the\nappreciation of music involves the intellect (Geist) rather\nthan the emotions, as music\u2019s only content is its form.\n\nHanslick\u2019s negative argument against the aesthetics of feeling\npasses through two main lines of attack: a series of rather weak\nobservations, and a brilliant argument grounded on a conceptual\nanalysis of emotion.\n\nHanslick observes that, when instrumental music is unaccompanied by a\ntext, music lovers are unable to indicate the feeling it expresses\nwith any considerable degree of intersubjective agreement. He famously\nadapts an example from Boy\u00e9, noting that Gluck\u2019s famous\naria \u201cChe far\u00f2 senza Euridice\u201d, expressive of\ndejection and despair, could express equally well joy if paired with a\nhappy text (Hanslick 1854: chapter 2). The argument is supposed to\nprove that music is expressively neutral, but it only works because of\nthe tendentious example. Music with a more clearly anguished character\nthan Gluck\u2019s aria is easy to find, and it would resist pairing\nwith a happy text.\n\nHanslick further observes that a recitative would lose its poignant\nand specific expressive character if played unaccompanied by words.\nHowever, it is unsurprising that music designed to represent emotions\ntogether with a text is less able to do so on its own.\n\nHanslick also notes that music lovers would agree that a large and\nimportant part of the Western repertoire, exemplified by Bach\u2019s\nWell-Tempered Clavier, does not represent any determinate\nemotion (Hanslick 1854: chapter 2). While this is a refutation of the\nclaim that music necessarily represents emotions, it is\nirrelevant to the view that music may do so.\n\nFinally, Hanslick produces what Kivy (1990b: 7) dubbed an\n\u201cargument from disagreement\u201d. Music critics will largely\nconcur about the beauty of various works of music, but they will\ndisagree when asked about the feeling they represent (Hanslick 1854:\nchapter 2). This is once more a weak argument, as it is easy to find\nworks of music that are consistently characterized as expressive of\nsome emotions, and not others.\n\nHanslick\u2019s strongest claim against the aesthetics of feeling\ninvolves a subtle conceptual analysis of the structure of emotions.\nHanslick observes that these cannot be identified by means of the\nfeeling state they produce in us, as the same emotion may arouse\ndifferent states, and two different emotions may share a similar one.\nThe additional component that allows us to discriminate between\ndifferent emotions is conceptual content. In Hanslick\u2019s example,\nhope requires a concept of a future, better condition, whereas\nmelancholy presupposes a comparison with a happier past. Hanslick\nconcedes that music may be able to match the dynamic profile\ncharacteristic of a feeling state. However, music cannot provide the\nconceptual content that is necessary to the identification of specific\nemotions, and it cannot therefore represent them (Hanslick 1854:\nchapter 2; Kivy [1990b: 9] observes that Hanslick\u2019s analysis\nanticipates the contemporary cognitive theory of emotions, first\nproposed in Kenny 1963; Alexander Malcolm [1721: 602] adumbrates the\nsame argument, though he is discussing aroused emotions, as opposed to\nrepresented ones).\n\nHanslick\u2019s positive view is that musical value is specifically\nmusical, independent from any relation to other art forms, as well as\nto any concept derived from extra-musical reality. He does not give up\ntalk of musical content entirely, but rather holds that this content\nis constituted by formal structures, \u201csonically moved\nforms\u201d (t\u00f6nend bewegte Formen; Hanslick 1854\n[2018]: chapter 3; an earlier, influential translation [Hanslick 1986]\nrenders the expression as \u201ctonally moving forms\u201d).\n\nAlthough he denied that music may represent emotions, Hanslick\nconcedes that it often arouses them. However, the emotions aroused by\nmusic are irrelevant to its aesthetic appreciation, as they do not\nhave a bearing on the understanding of music\u2019s formal\nproperties.\n\nHanslick explicitly describes On the Musically Beautiful as a\nreaction to Wagner and Liszt (see Bonds 2014: 155), and the treatise\nis at times explicitly polemical (see for instance the end of chapter\n2). There is in principle no tension between Hanslick\u2019s claim\nthat instrumental music\u2019s content is limited to its form, and\nWagner\u2019s use of music in combination with other art forms. In\nfact, the creation of hybrid works is an obvious way to address\ninstrumental music\u2019s alleged semantic and expressive paucity.\nHowever, Wagner\u2019s protestations against instrumental music and\nits inadequacy to his own goals were so radical that they threatened\nthe aesthetic legitimacy of absolute music. This is what Hanslick set\nout to restore.\n\nThe historian and musicologist Ottokar Hostinsk\u00fd\n(1847\u20131910) attempted to reconcile Wagner\u2019s and\nHanslick\u2019s views (Hostinsk\u00fd 1877; see also Lippman 1992:\n316\u2013317). His strategy was to argue for the possibility of\nhybrid art forms, while at the same time allowing for a specifically\nmusical beauty that is manifested in absolute music.\n\nWhile considerably less explored than his controversy with Wagner,\nHanslick\u2019s relation to Hegel is also interesting. Hegel\u2019s\nclaim regarding music\u2019s ability to express subjective life\nsurely falls within the scope of the negative argument laid out in\nOn the Musically Beautiful. However, Hanslick makes a\ncharacteristically Hegelian move when he holds that musical form is\nmusic\u2019s content. This is not a gratuitously paradoxical\nformulation, but rather bears the mark of Hegel\u2019s conception of\nbeauty as constituted by both form and content.\n\nHanslick\u2019s treatise was enormously influential, and it remains\nwidely discussed (for a review of early reactions, see Bonds 2014:\nappendix; recent work on Hanslick includes Landerer and Zangwill 2017,\nSousa 2017, and Wilfing 2018). Recent scholarship has challenged the\npredominant formalist interpretation of Hanslick\u2019s view (see\nHall 1995, and Wilfing 2016).\n1.7 Music and the Life Sciences: Darwin, Spencer, Gurney\n\nThe role of mathematics in the explanation of musical phenomena has\nbeen explored since Antiquity, and that of physics has become\nprominent since the seventeenth century. In the second half of the\nnineteenth century, scholars began to examine the relation of music to\nthe life sciences. A major force behind this shift of attitude is the\nwork of Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882). His theory of evolution\nposits two main processes responsible for changes in a living species,\nnatural selection and sexual selection. Individual variability and\nrandom mutations introduce differences in the traits possessed by\ndifferent individuals belonging to the same species. Traits that favor\nthe survival of offspring who would themselves go on to reproduce are\nmore likely to reappear in future generations. This is natural\nselection. Sexual selection concerns the selection of mating partners.\nWidespread preference for a given trait means that future generations\nwill be more likely to possess that trait. In both cases, the traits\nin question must be heritable.\n\nIn The Descent of Man (1871) and in The Expression of\nEmotions in Man and Animals (1872), Darwin proposes that sexual\nselection is responsible for the effect of music. He observes that\nvarious species produce vocalizations or other sounds as part of\ncourtship. For example, he identifies this as the goal of birdsong,\nalthough the consensus today is that birdsong also functions as a\nterritorial call. In virtue of this origin, music has the power\n\n\nof recalling in a vague and indefinite manner, those strong emotions\nwhich were felt during long-past ages, when, as is probable, our early\nprogenitors courted each other by the aid of vocal tones. (Darwin\n1872: 219 (chapter VIII); a contemporary defense of the view that the\narts are the product of sexual selections is found in Miller 2001; for\na recent review on the evidence supporting Darwin\u2019s hypothesis,\nsee Ravignani 2018)\n\n\nDarwin\u2019s hypothesis implies that music is likely to have\npredated language, as it arises from needs that are more basic than\nlinguistic communication. The inflections typical of impassioned\nspeech derive from those employed in courtship. Another feature of\nthis account is that is it better able to explain music\u2019s\nexpression and arousal of positive emotions, such as love, tenderness,\nand happiness, than that of negative emotions, as only the former are\ntypically involved in courtship.\n\nHerbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) defended an explanation of the\norigin of music distinct from Darwin\u2019s. Spencer holds as a\ngeneral physiological principle that any emotion produces movement.\nWhen movement involves the vocal tract, emotions result in\nvocalizations. Music derives from an exaggeration of the usual\nfeatures of vocal emotional expression. Thus, \u201cvocal music, and\nby consequence all music, is an idealization of the natural language\nof passion\u201d (Spencer 1857 [2015: 29]). This view of\nmusic\u2019s origin locates its expressive value in the melodic\nelement, rather than in harmony, as expressive vocalizations do not\nproduce more than one sound at once. However, Spencer emphasizes that\nhis explanation of music\u2019s origin is not to be taken as a\ngeneral theory of music\u2019s value, and that elements of music that\nare not amenable to its original function (notably harmony) remain\nentirely legitimate (Spencer 1890: 466\u2013467). Factual hypotheses\nregarding music\u2019s origin are thus separated from aesthetic\nnorms. This is a relevant methodological difference between\nSpencer\u2019s hypothesis about the origin of music and previous\nones, most notably Rousseau\u2019s (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 3.5).\n\nSpencer and Darwin expressed admiration for each other\u2019s work,\nalthough Kivy (1959: 47) points out that they were also aware of their\ncrucial methodological differences. While the former relied on general\nlaws as ultimate explanatory principles, Darwin accepted\ngeneralizations only insofar as they were supported by empirical\nevidence. Exemplary of this contrast is one of Spencer\u2019s\narguments against the view that music develops out of vocalizations\nemployed during courtship. Spencer holds that it is \u201cone of the\nfundamental laws of evolution\u201d that \u201c[a]ll development\nproceeds from the general to the special\u201d (1890: 458). To say\nthat a subset of vocalizations (those used during courtship) has\ngenerated a more general class of sounds (all vocalizations expressing\nemotions, including music) is to contradict that principle.\n\nWhile the figure of Edmund Gurney (1847\u20131888) is often discussed\nin association with Darwin and Spencer, and mostly exclusively in\nconnection with their views, the scope and quality of argumentation in\nhis work are comparable with few other works in Western musical\naesthetics. In view of this, the relatively little critical attention\nhe has received is surprising.\n\nGurney\u2019s framework is a formalist one, as he holds music\u2019s\nvalue to depend primarily on its presentation of abstract forms. This\nis achieved through music\u2019s \u201cideal motion\u201d, where\n\u201cideal\u201d refers to music\u2019s capacity to convey\nabstract forms (Gurney 1880: 164\u2013165). Form and motion are thus\nthe two essential aspects of music, and specifically of melody.\nAlthough talk of motion may suggests an analogy with physical space,\nGurney is explicit in saying that this is nothing but the\n\u201cfaintest metaphor\u201d (1880: 337), as the spatial character\nof melodic motion is radically different from that of visual arts and\narchitecture. Through an enlightening contrast with these art forms,\nGurney shows that music\u2019s motion is ordered in time, in such a\nway that the succession of its elements is already fixed. Not so in\nthe properly spatial arts, in which we apprehend elements in an order\ndetermined by our act of vision (Gurney 1880: 94). Gurney further\nargues the value of music must reside primarily in short sequences we\nare able to grasp in one hearing, and not in the understanding of\nlarge-scale structures (Gurney 1880: 96\u201397; a similar position,\ninspired by Gurney, has been recently defended in Levinson 1997).\n\nMusical forms are not merely an object of understanding, but also\narouse a distinctive emotion in us. In fact, Gurney holds that\nmusic\u2019s most important feature is its capacity to arouse an\nemotion which is specifically musical,\n\n\n\u2026an emotional excitement of a very intense kind, which yet\ncannot be defined under any known head of emotion. (Gurney 1880:\n120)\n\n\nGurney proposes a Darwinian explanation for this. Beautiful music\narouses an emotion that is unlike any other because it produces an\nunconscious association with the sexual emotion experienced by our\nforebears (Gurney 1880: 116 ff.). However, Gurney points out an\nimportant limit of this explanation: the Darwinian account cannot\nexplain why only beautiful music arouses such an emotion, as\nit posits a connection between musical phenomena in general and the\narousal of that emotion (Gurney 1880: 121\u2013124; 1887:\n297\u201398).\n\nGurney\u2019s formalism is more nuanced than views that entirely deny\nmusic\u2019s capacity to express emotions. While music\u2019s chief\nvalue resides in its capacity to be impressive, that is, to\narouse the peculiarly musical emotion that is connected to musical\nbeauty, Gurney concedes that music may be expressive, in that\nit may arouse emotions of the ordinary kind, or suggest extra-musical\nimages and ideas (Gurney 1880: 312). But expressiveness is subordinate\nto impressiveness. First, it is not an essential or even typical\nelement of valuable music, as much beautiful music isn\u2019t\nexpressive of any definite emotion. Second, it does not by itself give\nan explanation of the power and value of the art, as expressive\nqualities per se (e.g., in a face) are not a source of value\n(Gurney 1880: 338). Gurney\u2019s additional claims, that\nimpressiveness amplifies a piece\u2019s expressiveness (1880: 339)\nand is even required for expressiveness to be valuable (1880: 314),\nare hard to make sense of unless his theory of expressiveness is\nfurther clarified (an extensive discussion of Gurney\u2019s views is\nfound in Budd 1985: chapter 4).\n2. Twentieth Century\n2.1 Phenomenology of Music\n\nEdmund Husserl (1859\u20131938) developed phenomenology as a\nphilosophical method aimed at grounding any objectivity in the\nfirst-person experiences through which it is constituted. Husserl\ndevoted to music only passing observations, the best known of which is\nthe illustration of his analysis of time consciousness by means of the\nexperience of perceiving a melody (Husserl 1991). Other philosophers\nadopted a phenomenological methodology to carry out more systematic\ninvestigations (for a survey, see Lippman 1992: chapter 14).\n\nIn The Work of Music and the Problem of Its Identity, the\nPolish philosopher Roman Ingarden (1893\u20131970) adopted a\nphenomenological approach to conduct one of the first systematic\ninvestigations of musical ontology. From the methodological point of\nview, Ingarden embraces a descriptive approach. In his words:\n\n\nHowever fully developed, every theory of musical works that is not\nmere speculation but seeks a base in concrete facts must refer to the\npresystematic convictions that initially gave direction to the search.\n(Ingarden 1973 [1986: 1])\n\n\nOn this basis, he rejects the identification of musical works with\nideal objects, such as mathematical entities, for musical works come\ninto existence when they are first composed (Ingarden 1973 [1986: 15];\na phenomenological account of musical works as ideal objects had been\nproposed by Waldemar Conrad (1878\u20131915) (1908), whose view\nIngarden explicitly challenges). Works of music cannot be identified\nwith their score either, as they can be composed without being notated\nand may even exist in the complete absence of notational systems\n(Ingarden 1973 [1986: 38]). Ingarden holds instead that musical works\nare intentional objects. While they require an experiencing subject,\nthey cannot be identified with particular subjective experiences. This\nalso accounts for the temporality that is characteristic of musical\nworks. While a work\u2019s performance is extended in time, the work\nitself is not a temporal object. It merely specifies an order of\nsuccession between its elements. The musical work is thus\n\u201cquasi-temporal\u201d (Ingarden 1973 [1986: 70]). Ingarden also\naccounts for the apparent change of a work through time, a change that\nmay seem evident when one considers the radical differences in the\nperformance of the same work at different historical times. However,\ninsofar as the set of legitimate interpretations of a work is\ndetermined by its score, this change is one not in the work itself,\nbut merely in what is considered valuable about it (Ingarden 1973\n[1986: 156]) (on Ingarden\u2019s musical ontology, see Mitscherling\n1997: chapter 5).\n\nThe phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (1899\u20131959) is another\nphilosopher whose work on music deserves mention. Schutz\u2019s\nFragments Toward a Phenomenology of Music was written in\n1944, but published posthumously in 1976, and can be found in the\nfourth volume of his collected papers (Schutz 1996: 243\u2013275).\nSchutz starts from the rather commonplace observation that music is\nmeaningful though it lacks a conceptual or representational content.\nThis feature he connects with a less obvious property of musical\nworks. Some ideal objects may be grasped both monothetically as well\nas polythetically, that is, through a series of passages as well as in\none glance. For instance, I could follow the steps that lead to the\ndemonstration of Pythagoras\u2019s theorem and come to understand it,\nbut once I have done that I may also grasp the theorem in one single\nact, by grasping the proposition that expresses it (Schutz 1996:\n247\u2013248). But this is only possible because the theorem has a\nconceptual content that may be grasped once it has been understood.\nPrecisely because it lacks such content, music can only be grasped\npolythetically by following its development as we listen to it, or\nwhen we recollect its unfolding. Thus,\n\n\nthe statement that music cannot be caught monothetically is merely a\ncorollary of the thesis that the meaning-content of music is not\nrelated to a conceptual scheme. (Schutz 1996: 249)\n\n\nThis conclusion allows Schutz to break some ground in quite a\ndifferent area, one that remains relatively underexplored in Western\nphilosophy of music. In the essay Making Music Together\n(1951), Schutz considers the \u201cmutual tuning-in\nrelationship\u201d (Schutz 1951: 79) that is necessary to the\ninteractions between the various actors involved in music-making\n(composer, performers, and listeners). The polythetic constitution of\nthe musical object is what ultimately allows this relationship, as the\nvarious participants in music-making share a common \u201cflux of\nexperiences in inner time\u201d (Schutz 1951: 96).\n\nPhenomenology remains a widely adopted philosophical method. A more\nrecent phenomenological analysis of musical experience is found in\nClifton 1983.\n2.2 Music, Language, and Culture: Wittgenstein\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951), possibly the most influential\nphilosopher of the twentieth century, was a musically talented\nindividual. He played the clarinet and had extensive knowledge of the\nGerman classical repertoire.\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophical development is normally divided\ninto two periods. The earlier one revolves around his Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus (1921), in which Wittgenstein claims that\nlanguage is only meaningful when it describes contingent states of\naffairs. The propositions of logic, philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics\nare thus strictly speaking meaningless, in that they are normative or\notherwise non-factual. In these early works, Wittgenstein is\npredictably almost entirely silent about art. Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlate philosophical views found expression in the posthumously\npublished Philosophical Investigations (1953), as well as\nother writings. In these works, Wittgenstein conceives of linguistic\nmeaning as dependent on the way words are used within particular\nsituations or activities\u2014this he terms a\n\u201clanguage-game\u201d (Sprachspiel). Language-games are\ncountless and defy systematization, because they depend on the\nconstantly changing practices that constitute our form of life\n(Lebensform).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s late philosophy contains significant, if\ncharacteristically unsystematic, treatments of aesthetic issues, in\nwhich music figures prominently. In an interesting reversal of the\nusual strategy, Wittgenstein sometimes uses analogies with music to\nshed light on the workings of language. The most famous instance of\nthis is the remark:\n\n\nUnderstanding a sentence is much more akin to understanding a theme in\nmusic than one may think. What I mean is that understanding a sentence\nlies nearer than one thinks to what is ordinarily called understanding\na musical theme. (Philosophical Investigations,\n\u00a7527)\n\n\nHere Wittgenstein is using an analogy between language and music in\nthe attempt to move away from a conception of linguistic understanding\nas an inner process (see Lewis 1977 and Worth 1997). In both language\nand music, as in art more generally, understanding is manifested in\nour ability to act in appropriate ways. For example, a criterion for\nthe understanding of genre pictures could be the ability to describe\nor mime the actions that occur in them (Philosophical\nGrammar, III, 37). In the musical case, an obvious reaction that\nevinces understanding is the ability to competently describe or\nperform the music. More interestingly, Wittgenstein holds that the\nunderstanding of music is also manifested in our capacity to draw\nappropriate comparisons between music and extra-musical reality,\nparticularly the linguistic domain\u2014a musical phrase may be\ndescribed as a question, or remind us of the intonation we use when we\nutter a certain sentence (Philosophical Investigations,\n\u00a7527; Zettel, \u00a7175; for discussion, see Budd 2008,\n263\u201367).\n\nThe role of extra-musical references in the understanding of music\nraises the issue of whether Wittgenstein should be considered a\nformalist (see Ahonen 2005, and Szabados 2006; 2014). A decidedly\nformalist element in Wittgenstein\u2019s aesthetics is his separation\nof the understanding and appreciation of music from the effect it has\non us\u2014the move is similar to Hanslick\u2019s (see\n \u00a71.6;\n on Wittgenstein and Hanslick, see Szabados 2014, 39\u201357;\n94\u201397). Aesthetic value in general, and music\u2019s value more\nspecifically, is not reducible to an object\u2019s effect\n(Lectures on Aesthetics, IV, 2). Thus, an artwork is not\nvaluable because it conveys this or that emotion, but because it\nconveys itself (Wittgenstein 1977 [1998: 67]).\n\nHowever, the late Wittgenstein\u2019s view of musical understanding\ndoes not seem fully compatible with a formalist view (see Szabados\n2014: chapter 4). This is partly suggested by his comments on the\nappropriateness of extra-musical comparisons. A musical theme,\nWittgenstein observes,\n\n\nmakes an impression on me which is connected with things in its\nsurroundings\u2014e.g. with our language and its intonations; and\nhence with the whole field of our language-games. (Zettel,\n\u00a7135)\n\n\nMuch like the understanding and mastery of language presupposes its\ncompetent use in countless situations and activities, the\nunderstanding of music depends on our ability to use it and describe\nit appropriately in ways that are ultimately determined by our form of\nlife (see Hagberg 2017).\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that Wittgenstein\u2019s main\ncontribution to the philosophy of music is probably something he\nalmost never relates to music. This is the concept of aspect\nperception, exemplified by Joseph Jastrow\u2019s famous duck-rabbit\nambiguous figure, but also replicable in the auditory\ndomain\u2014e.g., hearing the metronome\u2019s ticking as groupings\nof two or three. Contemporary philosophers of music have appealed in\nvarious ways to aspect perception, to shed light on issues that range\nfrom musical understanding to the phenomenology of musical\nexpressiveness (see for instance Kivy 1989 and Arbo 2009; Guter 2020\nobserves that Wittgenstein\u2019s interest in aspect perception was\nlikely spurred by empirical studies on musical rhythm he made as a\nstudent).\n2.3 Music as Symbol: Langer and Goodman\n\nA recurring feature of twentieth century reflection on music is the\nattempt to consider it as a symbol system, and the related interest in\nthe analogies and differences between music and language.\n\nAn early and influential effort in this direction is that of Susanne\nLanger (1895\u20131985). In Philosophy in New Key (1942),\nshe rejects the idea that music is connected to emotional life in\nvirtue of a causal connection with emotions in the composer,\nperformer, or listener. Music is neither a \u201cstimulus\u201d to\nemotions, nor a \u201csymptom\u201d of them, but rather their\nsymbol:\n\n\nif it [music] has an emotional content, it \u201chas\u201d it in the\nsame sense that language \u201chas\u201d its conceptual\ncontent\u2014symbolically. (Langer 1942: 218)\n\n\nWhile music and language are alike in that they both have a semantic\nfunction, the analogy does not cut any deeper, according to Langer.\nShe distinguishes between discursive and presentational symbol\nsystems. Discursive symbolisms possess a vocabulary composed of\nidentifiable elements, to which a fixed meaning is associated.\nPresentational symbolisms lack such discrete meaningful units.\nLanguage is an example of the former, painting of the\nlatter\u2014both a sentence and a painting symbolize something, but\nthe sentence may be broken down into component parts with a fixed\nmeaning, whereas the painting cannot.\n\nAccording to Langer, musical symbols are presentational symbols of a\nparticular sort. The commonplace descriptions of music in emotional\nterms (\u201csad\u201d, \u201chappy\u201d,\n\u201cmelancholy\u201d, etc.) are due to an isomorphic relation\nbetween the dynamic form of music and that of feelings. For instance,\nthe musical expression of anxiety is achieved by prolonged, unresolved\ntensions, and this is the form of anxiety as we experience it. Because\nmusic matches the form of feelings much more closely than language may\neven aspire to do, musical symbols cannot be replaced by linguistic\nones without loss in precision\u2014this is Langer\u2019s version of\nthe ineffability thesis (see\n \u00a71.1).\n\nHowever, Langer acknowledges that radically different feelings may\nshare a common dynamic form, as may happen with an outburst of anger\nand one of joy. This means that music cannot have a definite emotional\nmeaning, but rather ranges over a variety of possible interpretations.\nThus, music is an \u201cunconsummated symbol\u201d, the exact import\nof which is not fixed (Langer 1942: 240).\n\nLanger\u2019s view has been attacked on various grounds (see Budd\n1985: chapter 6 and S. Davies 1994: chapter 3). Perhaps the most\nobvious objection is that music\u2019s dynamic structure matches that\nof emotions just as well as that of many other phenomena, but\nLanger\u2019s view does not explain why music is not a symbol of them\ntoo (Budd 1985: 114; Green 2007 offers a more plausible view of the\ncongruence between music and emotions).\n\nNelson Goodman\u2019s (1906\u20131998) Languages of Art\n(1968) is both a product of the already established theory of symbols,\nexemplified by Langer and Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), and a\nfoundational work in the development of analytic philosophy of art\n(see\n \u00a72.6).\n This is borne out by the tightly-knit weave of semiotics and ontology\nthat characterizes the book: Goodman develops a general theory of\nnotation that should account for the ontological status of works in\ndifferent art forms. He introduces a crucial distinction between\nautographic and allographic arts. Painting and\nsculpture are autographic, as only a determination of the work\u2019s\nhistory of production (that is, an attribution) guarantees the\nwork\u2019s authenticity. Music and literature are allographic, as\nwork identity depends on the presence of essential features as\ndetermined by a notation\u2014a word sequence in the case of a work\nof literature, and a score in the case of music. Forgeries of\nautographic works are works that claim a false history of production.\nForgeries of allographic works are impossible, as notation provides a\ntest for work-identity. If the candidate object meets it, it is an\ninstance of the work, if not, it is a different work.\n\nFor a notation to perform this function, it must meet certain strict\nsyntactic and semantic requirements (Goodman 1968: chapter 4). Goodman\nthinks that these requirements are met by most elements in Western\nmodern musical notation, with the important exceptions of dynamics,\ntempo indications, and others, which therefore become irrelevant to\nthe work\u2019s identity (but see Webster 1971). A performance counts\nas an instance of a given work if and only if it complies with its\nscore, and a work of music is nothing other than the class of\nperformances compliant with that score.\n\nThe notational systems that characterize allographic arts prescribe\nabsolute compliance, as a series of minor deviations could otherwise\nresult in a completely different work being considered an acceptable\ninstance of the original one. This means that only a note-for-note\naccurate performance of a musical work should count as an instance of\nit (see Predelli 1999).\n\nThis result is in tension not only with a sensible view of successful\nperformance, but also with one of Goodman\u2019s stated\nmethodological principles. He holds that the notational systems\ncharacteristic of allographic arts should provide rigorous identity\nconditions, while at the same time respecting our intuitive notion of\nwhat counts as a given artwork (Goodman 1968: 121\u2013122,\n197\u2013198). But Goodman\u2019s account of compliance between\nscore and performance is both too strict and too permissive to respect\nour intuitions: It fails to make room for pre-theoretically valid\nperformances (e.g., a rendition with a single wrong note), while\naccepting ones that we would consider incorrect (e.g., a performance\nthat is note-for-note correct, but played at a tempo that renders the\nwork unrecognizable). Subsequent work on the ontology of music has\ninherited from Languages of Art the notion of compliance and\nthe related idea that some features are determinative of a\nwork\u2019s identity, while also attempting to avoid Goodman\u2019s\nnotational strictures (see S. Davies 2001).\n\nGoodman\u2019s semiotic analysis also accounts for musical\nexpression. In his nominalist framework, for an object to possess a\nproperty is for it to be denoted by a predicate. If the\nobject refers back to that predicate, it exemplifies\nit\u2014a red swatch of cloth is denoted by the predicate\n\u201cred\u201d, but it also exemplifies it when it is used as a\nsample by a tailor. But properties may also be possessed\nmetaphorically\u2014a cloth is literally red, but a work of music is\nonly metaphorically sad. When an object exemplifies a property it\npossesses metaphorically, it expresses it. Expression is\nmetaphorical exemplification (Goodman 1968: 95). Note that this view\nexplains the logical structure of the description of music in\nemotional terms, but it does not attempt an explanation of why emotion\nterms are applied to music in the first place. In the philosophy of\nmusic, as in the philosophy of art more generally, Goodman was a\npivotal figure in setting the methodological tone of the subsequent\ninquiry in the English-speaking world, although his preferred\nsolutions have been largely disputed.\n2.4 Music and the Emotions: Pratt, Meyer, Cooke\n\nOver the course of the twentieth century, Anglophone philosophy of\nmusic produced various accounts of music\u2019s relationship to the\nemotions. In addition to the contributions of Langer and those of\nanalytic philosophers (see\n \u00a72.3\n and\n \u00a72.6),\n it is important to mention the views put forward by psychologist\nCarroll C. Pratt (1894\u20131979) and musicologists Leonard B. Meyer\n(1918\u20132007) and Deryck Cooke (1919\u20131976).\n\nPratt clarifies that he is not interested in music\u2019s arousal of\nemotions (Pratt 1954: 291\u2013292). We apply emotional words to\nmusic without implying that the music is arousing or may arouse such\nemotions in us or others. If this is the case, we need to explain why\nwe describe music, an inanimate object, using words that refer to\npsychological states.\n\nPratt argues that some dynamic qualities are common to both music and\nthe subjective experience of emotions. Thus, the agitation we hear in\nfast-paced, wayward music is an external, objective counterpart of the\nsubjective, internal sensation we experience when we feel agitated.\nThis correspondence between psychological states and perceptual\nfeatures of external objects is what grounds the description of the\nlatter in emotional terms. Pratt\u2019s view, conveyed in\nnuce by his slogan \u201cthe music sounds the way the emotions\nfeel\u201d, shares with Langer\u2019s theory the idea of an\nisomorphism between the structure of music and the phenomenology of\nemotional life. However, Pratt does not conceive of music as a sign of\nthe emotions, as their correspondence in terms of dynamic structure\ndoes not imply any representational relation from the former to the\nlatter (Pratt 1954: 290). This claim, along with Pratt\u2019s\nseparation of musical emotions from those it arouses in the listener,\ngives his view a clear formalist slant. The persuasiveness of\nPratt\u2019s hypothesis is ultimately dependent on whether we can\nproduce clearer evidence for the structural correspondence that is\ncentral to the account (criticism of Pratt\u2019s view is found in\nBudd 1985: chapter 3, and S. Davies 1994: chapter 3; Green [2007: 206]\nadvances a theory of expressiveness that partly vindicates\nPratt\u2019s intuition).\n\nMeyer\u2019s influential Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956)\nattempts to makes sense of musical emotions by holding that these\ndepend on the syntactical features of the music itself. Meyer\u2019s\nview rests on the questionable assumptions that emotions arise when a\ntendency to respond is inhibited. A tendency to respond is one\u2019s\ninclination to behave in a certain way. For instance, a smoker who\nfeels like smoking but is unable to find any cigarettes will feel\nincreasingly frustrated and upset. This person\u2019s emotion is\ngenerated by the inhibition of his tendency to respond (Meyer 1956:\n13\u201314; for criticism, see Budd 1985: 155\u2013157). In music, a\ntendency to respond is generated by the expectations that naturally\narise in more or less sophisticated listeners with regard to the\nsyntactic development of the piece. Music, and valuable music\nespecially, momentarily frustrates our expectations whenever it\ndevelops in unforeseen ways, and thereby arouses emotions without\nrequiring any reference to extra-musical reality.\n\nMeyer claims that his theory is able to reconcile two apparently\nopposite solutions to the problem of musical value and understanding.\nThese are the \u201cformalist option\u201d, according to which\nemotions are irrelevant to the appreciation of music, and the\n\u201cabsolute expressivist\u201d one, which holds music valuable\nfor the emotions it arouses in us. Meyer proposes that, if the\nexpectation is a conscious one, the response will be intellectual,\nrather than emotional. But if it is an unconscious expectation, as is\nthe case for most listeners, then its frustration will give rise to an\nemotional response. The formalist and the expressivist are thus two\ndifferent modes of engagement with music, as opposed to being\nincompatible views of its meaning and value (Meyer 1956:\n38\u201340).\n\nIn The Language of Music (1959), Cooke proposes that Western\nclassical composers have utilized an identifiable stock of melodic,\nharmonic, and rhythmic structures in order to convey emotion through\ntheir works. Cooke\u2019s model is linguistic not only in that it\nattempts to identify a vocabulary of musical expressiveness, but also\nbecause it conceives of music as a form of communication, and\nspecifically as the composer\u2019s communication of emotional states\nto the listener. It is thus a version of the expression theory (see\n \u00a71.1;\n Gabriel 1978 provides empirical evidence against Cooke\u2019s\nview).\n2.5 Marxist Approaches: Adorno and Bloch\n\nThe development of the sociology of music, as well as that of Marxist\nsocietal critique, gave rise to an interest in the socio-political\nnature of music-making that is unmatched in previous Western\nphilosophy (for an overview, see Fubini 1991: chapter 8).\n\nTheodor W. Adorno (1903\u20131969) is the foremost example of this\napproach, and one of the most significant philosophers of music in the\nWestern tradition. A philosopher and sociologist, in 1958 he became\ndirector of the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research. His dense\nwriting is made more difficult by his frequent and highly technical\nmusicological observations\u2014he was a trained musician and an\nactive composer, having studied with Arnold Schoenberg\u2019s pupil\nAlban Berg (Paddison 1993 and Witkin 1998 are book-length studies of\nAdorno\u2019s philosophy of music; for a shorter overview, see\nHamilton 2007: chapter 6).\n\nA central theme in Adorno\u2019s work is represented by the tension\nbetween the autonomy of the artwork as an aesthetic object and its\nsocial function (Adorno 1970 [1997: 252]). As a member of the\nFrankfurt School, Adorno\u2019s outlook is broadly Marxist, in that\nhe is interested in art as a product of society, as well as in its\npotential as vehicle of social critique.\n\nHowever, Adorno\u2019s advocacy of music as a critical tool does not\nresult in an endorsement of politically engaged music. The critical\nfunction of music is achieved once societal contradictions are\nembodied in the formal features of artworks, as opposed to being\nexplicitly denounced (see for instance Adorno 1970 [1997: 257]).\nAdorno writes:\n\n\nIn all art that is still possible, social critique must be raised to\nthe level of form, to the point that it wipes out all manifestly\nsocial content [Inhalt]. (1970 [1997: 250])\n\n\nAccording to Adorno, art achieves this critical capacity by becoming\nautonomous, that is, by rejecting direct social functions, including\nexplicitly political ones. However, it is not obvious how societal\ndynamics or contradictions could be embodied in works of pure\ninstrumental music (Zangwill 2012: 380\u2013381 is skeptical about\nthis possibility).\n\nIt is this framework that grounds Adorno\u2019s endorsement of\nSchoenberg against Stravinsky, which he develops in his Philosophy\nof New Music (1949). Schoenberg\u2019s atonal music is true to\nthe society that generated it because it rejects tonality, the\npossibilities of which Adorno considers thoroughly explored. Musical\nmaterial is thus historically \u201cpre-formed\u201d, in that the\nuse of tonal structures has a fundamentally different significance\ntoday than it had when tonal music was still developing.\nSchoenberg\u2019s music is progressive because it follows the laws of\ndevelopment intrinsic to the musical material he inherited from\ntradition. Stravinsky instead pulls musical structures from an\nirretrievable past, thereby producing music that is well-crafted, but\nultimately untrue (for a detailed analysis of Adorno\u2019s view of\nSchoenberg and Stravinsky, see Witkin 1998: chapters 7 and 8).\n\nThe attitude just described grounds Adorno\u2019s notorious\nreservations regarding popular music, which he elaborated in a number\nof essays, as well as in his influential Introduction to the\nSociology of Music (1962 [1976]). His view of \u201cjazz\u201d,\na label he employed liberally and at times confusingly (see Gracyk\n1992), and of popular music in general, is that its primary function\nis that of easily available entertainment, despite jazz\u2019s\nattempts to dissimulate this behind musical structures that are only\napparently novel. Standardization is the essential feature of popular\nmusic (Adorno 1962 [1976: 25]), and its result is music that\n\u201clistens for the listener\u201d (Adorno 1962 [1976: 29]), as it\ndoes not require any effort. The invisible hand that standardizes\ntaste and produces art having the sole function of entertaining the\nmasses is the culture industry, a concept which Adorno had elaborated\nin Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), co-authored with Max\nHorkheimer (1895\u20131973) (Horkheimer & Adorno 1947: chapter\n4).\n\nAdorno\u2019s qualms with regard to popular music may understandably\nappear elitist (see Baugh 1990). However, as Martin Jay points\nout,\n\n\nThe real dichotomy, Adorno contended, was not between\n\u201clight\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d music\u2014he was never\na defender of traditional cultural standards for their own\nsake\u2014but rather between music that was market-oriented and music\nthat was not. (Jay 1973: 182)\n\n\nThus, although popular music possesses standardized features that\nfavor its commodification, the culture industry also includes music\nfrom the past that has been commodified and reduced to a mere\ndistraction.\n\nMusic is also related to social change in the thought of the\nunorthodox Marxist philosophy of Ernst Bloch (1885\u20131977). The\nconcepts of utopia and hope are fundamental to his view, which finds\nits chief expression in The Spirit of Utopia (1918) and in\nThe Principle of Hope (1954). \u201cUtopia\u201d refers to\na potential future state to which humanity aspires, whereas hope is\nthe process of striving toward that utopic state. Art creates visions\nof alternative realities which, far from being mere illusions or\ndistractions, have utopian potential.\n\nBloch devotes a central chapter of his Spirit of Utopia to\nmusic, which he conceives of as a concerned with the inward side of\nthe utopian dimension, and thus with humanity\u2019s striving toward\nself-awareness and understanding. The chapter traces the unfolding of\nmusic\u2019s utopian potential in the Western tradition. This\nrestriction in focus seems to follow from an intentionally narrow\nconception of music, motivated by Bloch\u2019s characterization of\nthis art as concerned with the manifestation and development of\ninteriority. He thus denies that civilizations such as the Greek and\nthe Egyptian produced any music worth of interest, because their\nworldview was focused on exteriority and visuality (Bloch 1918,\n\u201cThe Mystery\u201d).\n\nIn Bloch\u2019s reconstruction, Western music develops through three\nstages, or \u201ccarpets\u201d (Teppiche), a concept he\nborrows from Georg Luk\u00e1cs (1885\u20131971) (Bloch 1918,\n\u201cThe Problem of a Historical Philosophy of Music\u201d). The\nfirst stage is represented by dance and chamber music, the second by\nthe music of Bach and Mozart, and particularly by the fugue, while the\nthird culminates in the symphonies of Beethoven and Bruckner. It is\nover the course of this development that music progressively realizes\nhumanity\u2019s awareness of itself (on Bloch\u2019s philosophy of\nmusic, see Zabel 1990, Korstvedt 2010, and Vidal 2003 [2010]).\n2.6 Analytic Philosophy of Music\n\nAnalytic approaches are presented in detail in the entry on\n the philosophy of music\n (for a book-length introduction, see Kania 2020). Here I shall focus\non two representative debates and indicate some general trends.\n\nAnalytic philosophy of music is at times regarded as exclusively\ncentered on linguistic and conceptual analysis, and dismissed on the\ngrounds of this narrow focus (see for instance Lippman 1992: 353). But\nthis picture is only faithful to its first stages of development.\nAnalytic philosophy of music has evolved, hybridized, and fragmented,\nmuch like analytic philosophy at large. In fact, contemporary analytic\nwork on music often includes sustained discussion of scientific or\nhistorical research (see for instance Robinson 2005, Nussbaum 2007,\nDyck 2014). A different feature is perhaps distinctive of the analytic\napproach, namely its systematic and often tacitly assumed veto on\nvalue judgments regarding the works, traditions, styles, etc. under\ninvestigation. Artistic value is not discovered or ascertained through\nphilosophical speculation, it is merely accounted for. This is in\nquite striking contrast with the approach of many other figures\ndiscussed in this entry, who first developed philosophical theories,\nand then on that basis produced sweeping dismissals of music that is\nwidely regarded as valuable\u2014think of Rousseau on French music or\nAdorno on jazz (on the differences between analytic and continental\nphilosophy of music, see Roholt 2017).\n\nThe systematic development of musical ontology is perhaps the most\ncharacteristic thematic focus of analytic philosophy, as the area had\nbeen almost entirely neglected by previous philosophical theories. The\nmost popular ontological views are type theories, according to which\nmusical works are repeatable entities, tokened by multiple sound\nevents. Some type theorists are Platonists. They hold that musical\nworks are abstract objects that do not come into existence (Kivy\n1983a, 1983b; Dodd 2007). A different approach holds that musical\nworks are created types, a feature that proponents argue makes sense\nof music as a human, contingent practice (Levinson 1980).\n\nAgainst Platonism, nominalist theories reject types and construe\nmusical works as collections of particulars (Goodman 1968; Predelli\n2001; Caplan & Matheson 2006). A less popular option is to\nconsider musical works as actions. Gregory Currie (1989) and David\nDavies (2004) have defended such a view with respect to artworks in\ngeneral, including musical ones. It has also been proposed that\nmusical works are best regarded as useful fictions that sustain our\ncritical and appreciative discourse about music (Kania 2008; Killin\n2018; for a recent overview of analytic ontology of music, see S.\nDavies 2020).\n\nRecent work has tackled meta-ontological questions, asking what\nprinciples should guide the construction of ontological theories (see\nfor instance Stecker 2009; Dodd 2013; D. Davies 2017). A useful\ndistinction is the one between descriptive and revisionary ontologies\n(Kania 2008), the former adhering to pre-theoretical conceptions of\nwhat a musical works is, the latter sacrificing intuitions for the\nsake of theoretical virtues.\n\nThough she ultimately rejects analytic approaches to the ontology of\nmusic, it is worth mentioning here Lydia Goehr\u2019s The\nImaginary Museum of Musical Works (1992), an extraordinarily\ninfluential study on the origin of the concept of musical work. Goehr\nargues that this concept emerged relatively recently in Western music\nhistory.\n\nAlong with ontology, musical expressiveness is probably the most\nfrequently discussed issue in analytic philosophy of music (for an\nintroduction to the debate, see Matravers 2007). An important advance\nin this area is represented by the distinction between the emotions\nmusic expresses and those it is expressive of (Kivy\n1989, elaborating on Tormey 1971). The saggy features of a Saint\nBernard dog make it look sad, but they do not stand in a causal\nrelation with a psychological state of sadness. The dog\u2019s face\nis expressive of sadness, but does not express sadness. Likewise,\nsadness is attributed to music regardless of whether it is the\nexpression of sadness or of any other emotion\u2014that\nMozart\u2019s Requiem Mass in D minor is expressive of\nanguish is something we can determine independently from the anguished\nstate its author may have found himself in when composing it. The\nemotions the music is expressive of are also conceptually distinct\nfrom those it may arouse in the listener\u2014the Requiem\nmay arouse anguish in me, but it would be an anguished work even if it\ndidn\u2019t. As intuitive as these distinctions may appear, previous\naccounts of the relationship between music and emotions did not trace\nthem explicitly, and at times seem to move from one notion to the\nother.\n\nWe thus have (1) the emotions a composer may have felt when writing\nthe piece (2) the emotions music may arouse in the listener, and (3)\nthe emotion we attribute to the music itself. Accounts of\nexpressiveness that construe it as dependent on (1) or (2) are named,\nrespectively, arousal and expression theories. Both approaches are\ngenerally considered as discredited, although a sophisticated version\nof the arousal theory has been defended by Derek Matravers (1998), and\na qualified defense of the expression theory has been advanced by\nJenefer Robinson (2005). Accounts of expressiveness that regard it as\nindependent from (1) and (2) need to explain why we use emotion words\nto describe a non-sentient object. Resemblance theories of musical\nexpressiveness argue that this is because of a perceived similarity\nbetween the music and the characteristic vocal and behavioral human\nexpressions of emotions (S. Davies 1980, 1994; Kivy 1989). Appeal to\nsuch resemblance in accounting for musical expressiveness is as old as\nphilosophy of music itself, but the careful separation of the emotions\nin the music from those aroused in the listener distinguishes these\nviews from virtually all their predecessors. The same distinction\nallows Peter Kivy (1934\u20132017) to develop a formalist view of\nmusical appreciation that recognizes the role of expressive properties\nbut unties them from the emotions aroused by music (Kivy 1990a).\nJenefer Robinson (2005) has developed a sophisticated hybrid theory of\nexpressiveness, arguing that the music\u2019s arousal of emotions at\nthe sub-personal level is partly responsible for the resemblances we\nperceive in the music.\n\nAn alternative way to flesh out the view of musical emotions as\nproperties of the music itself is the so-called persona\ntheory of expressiveness, according to which expressive music is\nexperienced as the emotional expression of a fictional persona\n(Levinson 2006). This proposal sidesteps the problems generated by the\npuzzling description of a non-sentient being in emotional terms, by\npositing that music is the emotional expression of a fictional\nindividual.\n\nAnalytic philosophy has so far manifested relatively little interest\nin matters of musical value and music\u2019s connection with moral,\nsocial, and political issues. Roger Scruton (1944\u20132020) deserves\nmention in this connection. His work shares with analytic philosophy\nsome broad thematic areas of interest, but generally defies\ncategorization. The sustained discussion of matters such as the\nsocio-cultural dimension of music and musical value sets his\nhumanistic approach apart from much other philosophical writing on\nmusic in the Anglophone world (see particularly Scruton 1997).\n",
