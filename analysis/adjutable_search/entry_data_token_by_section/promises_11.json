    "main_text": "Expectation Theory || Trust\n3.3 Trust\n\nThe third sort of expectational view, trust views, explain promises as\ninvitations to trust, where that concept is subtly different and\nsomewhat more demanding than expectation or reliance. Friederich and\nSouthwood (2011) pioneer this approach:\n\n\nAt the heart of the Trust View is the idea of inviting someone to\ntrust one to do something. To explicate this idea, consider first\nwhat it means for someone to trust one to do something. or\nsomeone to trust one to do something she must have a certain\nfaith or optimism in one\u2019s character insofar\nas one\u2019s doing it is concerned. (Friederich & Southwood\n2011: 278)\n\n\nFurther, the trusting relation requires that the promised act\ntypically be important to and desired by the promisee. So on the trust\nview, promises are simultaneously invitations to trust in the\npromisor\u2019s execution and acknowledgments of the importance and\nvalue of the promised act, as well as the other moral characteristics\nintegral to the trusting relation. Promissory obligations are formed\non the basis of the acceptance, or \u201cuptake\u201d, in the\njargon, of these invitations to trust.\n\nAll three sorts of expectation theory employ a condition of promissory\nuptake, as mentioned above. This has led to a separate set of\ndiscussions among scholars as to the nature of this condition.\n\nThere are a number of criticisms and objections in the literature to\nthe expectational approach to promissory obligations. One group of\nproblems revolves around the claim that by making promises out to be\nmerely expectation-producing mechanisms, expectationalists collapse\nthe distinction between promising and other things, like advising,\nwarning and threatening (see Raz 1972; Peetz 1977; see also\n\u00c1rdal 1979, in response).\n\nAdjunct to these problems is the charge that the expectationalist\ncan\u2019t explain why promissory expectations produce obligations,\nin a way that other expectations don\u2019t (see Raz 1972; Owens\n2006). Elinor Mason, in a recent article on Scanlon\u2019s theory\nargues in favor of the collapse, claiming that promises are just one\nsort of inducement to trust, and the harm of breaking a promise is\nexactly the harm of misleading that might be performed by lying or\notherwise deceiving (Mason 2005).\n\nAnother traditional problem for expectational views is a charge of\ncircularity (see Robins 1976; Prichard 1949; Warnock 1971). The\nproblem is this: When I promise someone to do something then, if all\ngoes well, as a result of my promise they come to trust that I will do\nthat thing. But this trust, on the expectational view, is the source\nof my obligation to do what I promise. So it seems that the trust of\nmy promisee is both the cause and the effect of my promise, and this\nseems an unacceptable circle. The problem is best framed in epistemic\nterms, as one of the reason that a promisee has to trust a promisor.\nThe intuitively obvious reason for the trust a promisee has is that\nthe promisor has promised, and as such has placed herself under a\nmoral obligation to do the deed. This belief, combined with beliefs\nabout the moral rectitude of the promisor, give the promisee a sound\nreason to believe that the promisor will keep her promise. The problem\nfor the expectational view is that the promisee, on such a view,\ncan\u2019t rely on the fact of the promissory obligation as a reason\nto trust, since on this view that obligation rests on the prior fact\nof the trust itself. If the trust of the promisor is the ground of the\nmoral obligation to keep a promise, then prior to the promisee coming\nto trust the promisor, no such obligation exists. So when the promisee\ngoes searching for a reason to trust, the standard one is barred from\nconsideration.\n\nMoreover, if an expectationalist aims to offer a theory that explains\npromissory obligation without the invocation of a convention or\npractice of promising (like Scanlon does), then the other standard\nroute to explaining promise trust is blocked. If there is a convention\nin place that governs promises, and if that convention is such as to\ninspire confidence in promisees that promisors will keep their\npromises, then promises can be said to generate the necessary\nexpectations. But such a view is incompatible with the claim that\nconventions aren\u2019t necessary to explain promissory obligations.\nThese objections are pressed against Scanlon\u2019s theory by N.\nKolodny and R. J. Wallace (2003).\n\nAnother traditional set of problems with the expectational approach is\ntheir difficulty in handling cases where the expectations that\nnormally attend a promise are lacking. The Desert Island/Deathbed\ncases are one such problem, where the expectations are lacking because\nthe promisee is dead. Scanlon discusses another sort of case, the\nProfligate Pal (Scanlon 1998: 312) where the promisee fails to have\nthe standard expectations because the promisor (the profligate pal)\nhas made and broken too many promises in the past. In such cases\nexpectationalists must either admit that there is no obligation to\nkeep the promise, which seems very counterintuitive, or come up with\nsome reason for the obligation apart from the fact that the promise\ncreated expectations in the promisee. See the section covering\n promises to the dead [\u00a75.1],\n for more information.\n",
