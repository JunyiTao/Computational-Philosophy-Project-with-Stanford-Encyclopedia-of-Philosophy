    "main_text": "Substance, Matter, and Subject\n6. Substance, Matter, and Subject\n\n\u0396.3 begins with a list of four possible candidates for being the\nsubstance of something: essence, universal, genus, and subject.\nPresumably, this means that if x is a substance, then the\nsubstance of x might be either (i) the essence of x,\nor (ii) some universal predicated of x, or (iii) a genus that\nx belongs to, or (iv) a subject of which x is\npredicated. The first three candidates are taken up in later chapters,\nand \u0396.3 is devoted to an examination of the fourth candidate: the\nidea that the substance of something is a subject of which it is\npredicated.\n\nA subject, Aristotle tells us, is \u201cthat of which the other\nthings are said, but which is itself not further said of any other\nthing\u201d (1028b36). This characterization of a subject\nis reminiscent of the language of the Categories, which tells\nus that a primary substance is not predicated of anything else,\nwhereas other things are predicated of it. Candidate (iv) thus seems\nto reiterate the Categories criterion for being a substance.\nBut there are two reasons to be wary of drawing this conclusion.\nFirst, whereas the subject criterion of the Categories told\nus that substances were the ultimate subjects of predication, the\nsubject criterion envisaged here is supposed to tell us what the\nsubstance of something is. So what it would tell us is that\nif x is a substance, then the substance of\nx\u2014that which makes x a substance\u2014is a\nsubject that x is predicated of. Second, as his next comment\nmakes clear, Aristotle has in mind something other than this\nCategories idea. For the subject that he here envisages, he\nsays, is either matter or form or the compound of matter and form.\nThese are concepts from Aristotle\u2019s Physics, and none\nof them figured in the ontology of the Categories. To\nappreciate the issues Aristotle is raising here, we must briefly\ncompare his treatment of the notion of a subject in the\nPhysics with that in the Categories.\n\nIn the Categories, Aristotle was concerned with subjects of\npredication: what are the things we talk about, and ascribe properties\nto? In the Physics, his concern is with subjects of change:\nwhat is it that bears (at different times) contrary predicates and\npersists through a process of change? But there is an obvious\nconnection between these conceptions of a subject, since a subject of\nchange must have one predicate belonging to it at one time that does\nnot belong to it at another time. Subjects of change, that is, are\nalso subjects of predication. (The converse is not true: numbers are\nsubjects of predication\u2014six is even, seven is prime\u2014but\nnot of change.)\n\nIn the Categories, individual substances (a man, a horse)\nwere treated as fundamental subjects of predication. They were also\nunderstood, indirectly, as subjects of change. (\u201cA substance,\none and the same in number, can receive contraries. An individual man,\nfor example, being one and the same, becomes now pale and now dark,\nnow hot and now cold, now bad and now good\u201d\n4a17\u201320.) These are changes in which substances move,\nor alter, or grow. What the Categories did not explore,\nhowever, are changes in which substances are generated or destroyed.\nBut the theory of change Aristotle develops in the Physics\nrequires some other subject for changes such as these\u2014a subject\nof which substance is predicated\u2014and it identifies matter as the\nfundamental subject of change (192a31\u201332). Change is\nseen in the Physics as a process in which matter either takes\non or loses form.\n\nThe concepts of matter and form, as we noted, are absent from the\nCategories. Individual substances\u2014this man or that\nhorse\u2014apart from their accidental characteristics\u2014the\nqualities, etc., that inhere in them\u2014are viewed in that work as\nessentially simple, unanalyzable atoms. Although there is metaphysical\nstructure to the fact that, e.g., this horse is white (a\ncertain quality inheres in a certain substance), the fact that\nthis is a horse is a kind of brute fact, devoid of\nmetaphysical structure. This horse is a primary substance, and\nhorse, the species to which it belongs, is a secondary\nsubstance. But there is no predicative complex corresponding to the\nfact that this is a horse in the way that there is such a complex\ncorresponding to the fact that this horse is white.\n\nBut from the point of view of the Physics, substantial\nindividuals are seen as predicative complexes (cf. Matthen 1987b);\nthey are hylomorphic compounds\u2014compounds of matter and\nform\u2014and the subject criterion looks rather different from the\nhylomorphic perspective. Metaphysics \u0396.3 examines the\nsubject criterion from this perspective.\n\nMatter, form, and the compound of matter and form may all be\nconsidered subjects, Aristotle tells us, (1029a2\u20134),\nbut which of them is substance? The subject criterion by itself leads\nto the answer that the substance of x is an entirely\nindeterminate matter of which x is composed\n(1029a10). For form is predicated of matter as subject, and\none can always analyze a hylomorphic compound into its predicates and\nthe subject of which they are predicated. And when all predicates have\nbeen removed (in thought), the subject that remains is nothing at all\nin its own right\u2014an entity all of whose properties are\naccidental to it (1029a12\u201327). The resulting subject\nis matter from which all form has been expunged. (Traditional\nscholarship calls this \u201cprime matter,\u201d but Aristotle does\nnot here indicate whether he thinks there actually is such a thing.)\nSo the subject criterion leads to the answer that the substance of\nx is the formless matter of which it is ultimately\ncomposed.\n\nBut Aristotle rejects this answer as impossible (1029a28),\nclaiming that substance must be \u201cseparable\u201d\n(ch\u00f4riston) and \u201cthis something\u201d (tode\nti, sometimes translated \u201csome this\u201d), and implying\nthat matter fails to meet this requirement. Precisely what the\nrequirement amounts to is a matter of considerable scholarly debate,\nhowever. A plausible interpretation runs as follows. Separability has\nto do with being able to exist independently (x is separable\nfrom y if x is capable of existing independently of\ny), and being a this something means being a determinate\nindividual. So a substance must be a determinate individual that is\ncapable of existing on its own. (One might even hold, although this is\ncontroversial, that on Aristotle\u2019s account not every \u201cthis\nsomething\u201d is also \u201cseparable.\u201d A particular color\nor shape might be considered a determinate individual that is not\ncapable of existing on its own\u2014it is always the color of shape\nof some substance or other.) But matter fails to be simultaneously\nboth ch\u00f4riston and tode ti. The matter of\nwhich a substance is composed may exist independently of that\nsubstance (think of the wood of which a desk is composed, which\nexisted before the desk was made and may survive the disassembly of\nthe desk), but it is not as such any definite individual\u2014it is\njust a quantity of a certain kind of matter. Of course, the matter may\nbe construed as constituting a definite individual substance (the wood\njust is, one might say, the particular desk it composes), but\nit is in that sense not separable from the form or shape that makes it\nthat substance (the wood cannot be that particular desk unless it is\na desk). So although matter is in a sense separable and in a\nsense a this something, it cannot be both separable and a this\nsomething. It thus does not qualify as the substance of the thing\nwhose matter it is.\n",
