    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Trials and Punishment\n3.5 Trials and Punishment\n\nPunishment is the intentional infliction of harm or suffering on a\nwrongdoer in response to a wrong committed. Although transitional\nsocieties are sometimes portrayed as having to choose between\nreconciliation and punishment, these responses are not necessarily\nopposed (Bennett 2008, Verdeja 2009). As is often clear in\ninterpersonal or criminal cases, the punishment of a wrongdoer (and\nespecially the wrongdoer\u2019s acceptance of that punishment) can be\na process by which the wrongs of the past are redressed. The power of\npunishment to put the past to rest has been explained in a number of\ndifferent ways, such as repaying a debt, removing an unfair advantage\n(Morris 1968), satisfying the victim\u2019s anger (Hershenov 1999),\nor reaffirming the equal moral status of victims (Hampton 1992).\nImplicit in this last analysis is the assumption that wrongdoing is\nfundamentally expressive, and what is expressed is the inferior moral\nstanding of the victim, which permits the infliction of harm. Criminal\nprosecutions help victims re-gain sense of status as rights holder and\nso enhance dignity (Nino 1998, Bennett 2008).\n\nIn the context of transitions to democracy, some scholars concentrate\nspecifically on the significance of trials in response to collective\nand politically significant crimes, such as those involving human\nrights abuses by officials. Criminal trials mark a clear break from\nthe past (Malamud-Goti 1990). Trials signal the official disapproval\nof the actions for which an individual is being prosecuted, actions\nthat may not have been officially condemned before. Criminal trials\nand punishment are also claimed to make a crucial contribution to\nsocietal reconciliation by reaffirming the normative standards that\nshould govern interaction. Punishment can signify or cultivate a\ncommitment to the rule of law, as well as the faith in law and decency\namong officials upon which the rule of law depends (C. Murphy\n2010).\n\nOn the other hand, a number of scholars are skeptical about the\nreconciliatory impact of criminal trials, especially in response to\nwidespread wrongdoing. Judith Shklar (1964) and Hannah Arendt (1977)\nargue trials do little to heal victims wounded by wrongdoing and have\nlittle pedagogical role regarding the normative standards that should\ngovern relations. Trials fundamentally are oriented towards the\nestablishment of the guilt of individual perpetrators, not the pursuit\nof the truth about the past. This can lead to a very limited\nunderstanding of the collective character of the injustices\nperpetrated, their impact on victims and the broader context that made\nsuch wrongdoing possible, all of which may be important for\nreconciliation (Llewellyn and Howse 1999, Isaacs 2016). Moreover, the\nability of domestic criminal justice systems in transitional societies\nto adhere to internationally recognized procedural standards has been\nquestioned, as has the justifiability of selectively prosecuting only\na fraction of the perpetrators involved in collective crimes (van Zyl\n2000).\n",
