Philosophy of Science\n\nCompared to financial practitioners, one could think that financial\neconomists should be at an epistemic advantage in matters of money and\nfinance. Financial economics is a fairly young but well established\ndiscipline in the social sciences that seeks to understand, explain,\nand predict activities within financial markets. However, a few months\nafter the crash in 2008, Queen Elizabeth II famously asked a room full\nof financial economists in London why they had not predicted the\ncrisis (Egidi 2014). The Queen\u2019s question should be an excellent\nstarting point for an inquiry into the philosophy of science of\nfinancial economics. Yet only a few philosophers of science have\nconsidered finance specifically (Vergara Fern\u00e1ndez & de\nBruin\n 2021).[1]\n\nSome important topics in financial economics have received partial\nattention, including the Modigliani-Miller capital structure\nirrelevance theorem (Hindriks 2008), the efficient market hypothesis\n(Collier 2011), the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Weatherall\n2017), portfolio theory (Walsh 2015), financial equilibrium models\n(Farmer & Geanakoplos 2009), the concept of money (M\u00e4ki\n1997), and behavioral finance (Brav, Heaton, & Rosenberg 2004),\neven though most of the debate still occurs among economists\ninterested in methodology rather than among philosophers. A host of\ntopics remain to be investigated, however: the concept of Value at\nRisk (VaR) (and more broadly the concept of financial risk), the\ncapital asset pricing model (CAPM), the Gaussian copula, random walks,\nfinancial derivatives, event studies, forecasting (and big data),\nvolatility, animal spirits, cost of capital, the various financial\nratios, the concept of insolvency, and neurofinance, all stand in need\nof more sustained attention from philosophers.\n\nMost existing work on finance in philosophy of science is concerned\nwith models and modelling (see also\n models in science\n and\n philosophy of economics).\n It seems intuitive to view financial markets as extremely complex\nsystems: with so many different factors at play, predicting the price\nof securities (shares, bonds, etc.) seems almost impossible. Yet\nmainstream financial economics is firmly committed to the idea that\nmarket behavior should be understood as ultimately resulting from\ninteractions of agents maximizing their expected utility. This is a\ndirect application of the so-called neoclassical school of economics\nthat was developed during the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. While this school continues to dominate textbooks in the\nfield, there is a growing scholarly trend that seeks to criticize,\ncomplement or even replace some of its main assumptions. We can see\nhow the problems play out in both corporate finance and asset pricing\ntheory.\n\nCorporate finance concerns the financing of firms. One question\nconcerns a firm\u2019s capital structure: should a firm obtain\nfunding through equity (that is, from shareholders expecting\ndividends) or through debt (that is, from bondholders who lend money\nto the firm and have a contractual right to receive interest on the\nloans), or through a combination of the two. A key result in corporate\nfinance is the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which says that a\nfirm\u2019s capital structure is irrelevant to its market value\n(Modigliani & Miller 1958). This theorem makes a number of highly\nunrealistic assumptions, among them the assumption that markets are\nefficient, and that there are no taxes. Alongside many other results\nin economics, it may therefore be considered as useless for predictive\npurposes; or even as dangerous, once used for such purposes\nnonetheless (Egidi 2014). In a detailed study of the Modigliani-Miller\ntheorem, Hindriks (2008) has argued, however, that the value of highly\nidealized models in economics may lie in their providing\ncounterfactual insights, just as in physics. Galileo\u2019s law of\nfree fall tells us what happens in a vacuum. Despite the fact that\nvacuum is rare in reality, the law is not uninformative, because it\nallows us to associate observed phenomena to the extent to which an\nunrealistic assumption must be relaxed. Similarly, if one of the\nassumptions that the Modigliani-Miller theorem makes is the absence of\ntaxes, the observed relevance of capital structure may well have to be\nexplained as resulting from particular tax regimes. The explanation\nobtained by relaxing unrealistic assumptions is called\n\u201cexplanation by concretization\u201d (Hindriks 2008).\n\nExplanation by concretization works if models and reality share at\nleast a few concrete features. This is arguably the case for many\nextant models in finance, including models of bubbles and crises that\nare immediately relevant to explaining the 2008 crisis (Abreu &\nBrunnermeier 2003). A fairly recent development called\n\u201ceconophysics\u201d may, however, be an exception. Econophysics\nuses physics methods to model financial markets (see Rickles 2007 for\nan overview). Where traditional models of crises include individual\ninvestors with beliefs and desires modelled by probability\ndistributions and utility functions, econophysics models capture\ncrises the way physicists model transitions of matter from fluid to\nsolid state (Kuhlmann 2014).\n\nNext, consider asset pricing theory. Ever since Bachelier\u2019s\ngroundbreaking mathematical treatment of asset pricing, financial\neconomists have struggled to find the best way to determine the price\ndevelopments of securities such as shares, bonds, and derivative\ninstruments such as options. The mathematics of financial returns has\nreceived some attention in the literature (de Bruin & Walter 2017;\nIppoliti & Chen 2017). Most models assume that returns follow\nGaussian random walks, that is, stochastic processes in discrete time\nwith independent and identically distributed increments. Empirical\nstudies show, however, that returns are more peaked than Gaussian\ndistributions, and that they have \u201cfat tails\u201d. This means\nthat extreme events such as financial crises are far less improbable\nthan the models assume. An exception with regards to these assumptions\nis Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot\u2019s (1963) well-known contribution to\nfinancial mathematics, and work in this direction is gaining traction\nin mathematical finance.\n\nA third aspect of financial models concerns the way they incorporate\nuncertainty (Bertolotti & Magnani 2017). Some of the problems of\ncontemporary financial (and macroeconomic) models are due to the way\nthey model uncertainty as risk, as outlined above (Frydman &\nGoldberg 2013). Both neo-classical models and behavioral economics\ncapture uncertainty as probabilistic uncertainty, consequently\nignoring Knightian uncertainty (Knight 1921 see also\n decision theory).\n The philosophy of science literature that pertains to financial\neconomics is, however, still fairly small (Vergara Fern\u00e1ndez\n& de Bruin 2021).\n",
