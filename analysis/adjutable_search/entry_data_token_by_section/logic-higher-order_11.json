    "main_text": "Model Theory of Second-Order Logic || Second-order characterizable structures\n7.1 Second-order characterizable structures\n\nA structure \\(\\ma\\) is second-order characterizable if there\nis a second-order sentence \\(\\theta_\\ma\\) such that\n\\(\\mb\\models\\theta_\\ma\\iff\\mb\\cong\\ma\\) for all structures \\(\\mb\\) of\nthe same vocabulary as \\(\\ma\\).\n\n\nExample 5: The following structures are second-order\ncharacterizable:\n\nNatural numbers: \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\).\nReal numbers: \\((\\oR,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\).\nComplex numbers: \\((\\oC,+,\\cdot,0,1)\\).\nThe first uncountable ordinal \\((\\omega_1,<)\\).\nThe level \\((V_\\kappa,\\in)\\) of the cumulative hierarchy, where\n\\(\\kappa\\) is the first strongly inaccessible cardinal\n\\(>\\omega\\).\nThe well-order \\((\\kappa,<)\\) of the first weakly compact\ncardinal \\(>\\omega\\).\n\n\n\nAre all structures second-order characterizable? There are\nonly countably many second-order sentences, hence only countably many\n(up to isomorphism) second-order characterizable structures. Therefore\nthere are lots of structures of every infinite cardinality which are\nnot second-order characterizable. However, it is not easy to give\nexamples. One example is \\((\\kappa,<)\\), where \\(\\kappa\\) is the\nfirst measurable cardinal (\\(>\\omega\\)). See\n \u00a77.2\n for an explanation. Another example is \\((\\oN,<,A)\\), where\nA is the set of G\u00f6del numbers of valid second-order\nsentences in the vocabulary of one binary relation. For an\nexplanation, see\n \u00a77.2.\n One may ask whether there is an example which arises from\nmathematical practice outside of mathematical logic. What about\n\\((\\oR,+,\\times,<,A)\\), where A is a Hamel basis (a basis\nfor the vector space where the reals are the vectors, rationals are\nthe scalars and vector addition is the usual addition of reals)? It is\nconsistent, relative to the consistency of ZF that no such structure\n\\((\\oR,+,\\times,<,A)\\) is second-order characterizable (Hyttinen,\nKangas, & V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2013).\n\nA special property of second-order characterizable structures is that\ntheir reducts are also second-order characterizable, because we can\nuse existential second-order quantifiers to \u201cguess\u201d the\nmissing relations and functions. Therefore it is interesting to find\ncharacterizable structures that have as many (but only finitely many)\nrelations and functions as possible. We can endow \\(\\oN\\) with any\nfinite number of recursive functions \\(f_1,\\ldots, f_n \\) and\nrelations \\(R_1,\\ldots, R_m\\) obtaining the structure\n\\((\\oN,f_1,\\ldots, f_n,R_1,\\ldots, R_m)\\) and this is second-order\ncharacterizable. We can endow \\(\\oR\\) with any familiar analytic\nfunctions such as trigonometric functions or any other functions given\nby a convergent power series the coefficients of which are given by a\nrecursive function, and the result is second-order\ncharacterizable.\n\nIt is easy to see that the second-order theory of a second-order\ncharacterizable structure \\(\\ma\\) is Turing-reducible to the\nsecond-order theory of any bigger second-order characterizable\nstructure \\(\\mb\\), as for all second-order \\(\\phi\\):  \n\n\\[\\ma\\models\\phi\\iff\\mb\\models\\exists P(\\theta_\\ma^{P}\\land\\phi^{P}).\n\\]\n\n\nThe bigger the characterizable structure is, the more complex is the\nsecond-order theory. That there is no largest characterizable\nstructure can be seen as follows: If \\(\\ma\\) is second-order\ncharacterizable, then so is the reduct of \\(\\ma\\) to the empty\n vocabulary[8],\n that is, the cardinality \\(|A|\\) of \\(\\ma\\) is characterizable. Such\ncardinal numbers were studied by Garland (1974). For example, if\n\\(\\kappa\\) is characterizable, then so are \\(\\kappa^+\\) and\n\\(2^\\kappa\\).\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order sentence, we define  \n\n\\[\\Mod(\\phi)=\\{\\mm: \\mm\\models\\phi\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) characterizes a model \\(\\ma\\), then \\(\\Mod(\\phi)\\) is just\nthe class of models isomorphic to \\(\\ma\\). If we look at\n\\(\\Mod(\\phi)\\) from the perspective of set theory, we know it is\n\\(\\Delta_2\\)\n (Theorem 4).\n On the other hand, the set of G\u00f6del numbers of valid\nsecond-order sentences is \\(\\Pi_2\\)-complete\n (Theorem 4),\n hence not \\(\\Sigma_2\\) and in particular, not \\(\\Delta_2\\). This\ncontemplation leads us to the following extension of\n Theorem 3\n above:\n\n\nTheorem 6 (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2012) Second-order\nvalidity is not second-order definable on any second-order\ncharacterizable structure.\n\n\nThis raises the question, how can we understand second-order validity\nfrom the second-order perspective? In view of the above theorem we\ncannot understand second-order validity as something that can be\nexpressed in second-order logic on some structure which itself can be\ncharacterized in second-order logic. The reference to set theory seems\ninevitable in understanding second-order validity. Let us discuss what\nthis might mean from the point of view of structuralism. Parsons\ndefines structuralism as follows:\n\n\nBy the \u201cstructuralist view\u201d of mathematical objects, I\nmean the view that reference to mathematical objects is always in the\ncontext of some background structure, and that the objects involved\nhave no more to them than can be expressed in terms of the basic\nrelations of the structure. (Parsons 1990: 303)\n\n\nStructuralism in this sense (for other kinds of structuralism, see,\ne.g., Hellman 2001) seems to fit well into the second-order logic\nframework. Contrary to set theory, second-order logic always assumes\nan underlying (limited) structure which is supposed to reflect one\nparticular aspect of mathematics such as the semi-ring of natural\nnumbers, the ordered field of real numbers, the field of complex\nnumbers, the well-ordered structure \\((\\omega_1,<)\\), and so on.\nIdeally, these underlying structures are second-order characterizable.\nThis leads to a problem with universal truths such as validity, but\nalso with less complex ones such as the statement that every linear\norder has a completion, or that every field has an algebraic closure.\nSuch universal truths are not about any particular structure.\n\n\n",
