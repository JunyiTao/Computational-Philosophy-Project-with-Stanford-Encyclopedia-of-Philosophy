    "main_text": "Galileo Galilei || A non-Aristotelian account of the cognitive function of the senses\n2.3 A non-Aristotelian account of the cognitive function of the senses\n\nThe mistake of supposing tastes, etc. are qualities that inhere in\ninanimate bodies is charged not to our senses, but to the use of\nlanguage. It seems we give names to the primary affections which we\nknow to exist in bodies and we give names to the sensations of our SQs\nas well. This makes us believe the names of the latter apply to bodies\njust as the names of the former do. According to Galileo, the names of\nSQs signify nothing when used in this way. This poses a challenge to\nthe traditional Aristotelian scholastic theory of sense perception.\nAccording to Aristotle, the nature of sentient beings assures that\nthey acquire perceptual knowledge in an environment such as ours. Some\ncare is called for, but no special effort is generally needed. On\nGalileo\u2019s theory, many sense perceptions are caused by\ninsensible particles whose properties are by no means easy to know.\nWhen a fire makes us warm, it is easy to feel the warmth but the rapid\nmotion of particles that causes it has to be discovered by rigorous-s\nuse of an effective method of natural philosophical inquiry.\n\nGalileo objects specifically to two principles of a contemporary\nversion of the Aristotelian stance: that mathematics is only\naccidentally applicable to material things and the doctrine of proper\nand common sensibles. A proper sensible is an object that is directly\nperceived by only one sense\u2014color, by sight alone; sound, by\nhearing, etc. The faculty and its proper object are said to be fitted\nto each other so that use of that faculty seldom results in\nmisperception of the quality special to it. By contrast, the common\nsensibles\u2014size. figure, motion/rest\u2014are directly perceived\nby more than one sense; as a result, we are supposedly more liable to\nmistakes about them. Galileo\u2019s objection reconceives the\ncondition that makes perception of a body veridical or deceptive.\n(Crombie 1972: 74\u20139; Piccolino & Wade 2008: 1312\u201315)\nHe argues that the appearance of a body corresponds to the properties\nof the body that are its cause;. It is not up to . philosophy to say\nhow various apearances are related to the affections of the objects we\nperceive; rather it requires the technical methods of natural\nphilosophy. For example, to avoid being deceived by the broken visual\nappearance of an oar half in water, we need to find the physical cause\nof the appearance. This will show that the visual appearance is\ncorrect. According to Galileo\u2019s epistemology, we should assume\nappearances do not exhibit the properties of their causes but rather\nsomething from which we may be able to figure them out.\n",
