    "main_text": "Major Themes in Emerson\u2019s Philosophy || Power\n2.5 Power\n\nPower is a theme in Emerson\u2019s early writing, but it becomes\nespecially prominent in such middle- and late-career essays as\n\u201cExperience,\u201d \u201cMontaigne, or the Skeptic\u201d\n\u201cNapoleon,\u201d and \u201cPower.\u201d Power is related to\naction in \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d where Emerson holds that\na \u201ctrue scholar grudges every opportunity of action past by, as\na loss of power\u201d (CW1: 59). It is also a subject of\n\u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d where Emerson writes of each person that\n\u201cthe power which resides in him is new in nature\u201d (CW2:\n28). In \u201cExperience\u201d Emerson speaks of a life which\n\u201cis not intellectual or critical, but sturdy\u201d (CW3: 294);\nand in \u201cPower\u201d he celebrates the \u201cbruisers\u201d\n(CW6: 34) of the world who express themselves rudely and get their\nway. The power in which Emerson is interested, however, is more\nartistic and intellectual than political or military. In a\ncharacteristic passage from \u201cPower,\u201d he states:\n\nIn history the great moment, is, when the savage is just ceasing to be\na savage, with all his hairy Pelasgic strength directed on his opening\nsense of beauty:-and you have Pericles and Phidias,-not yet passed\nover into the Corinthian civility. Everything good in nature and the\nworld is in that moment of transition, when the swarthy juices still\nflow plentifully from nature, but their astringency or acridity is got\nout by ethics and humanity. (CW6: 37\u20138)\n\n\nPower is all around us, but it cannot always be controlled. It is like\n\u201ca bird which alights nowhere,\u201d hopping \u201cperpetually\nfrom bough to bough\u201d (CW3: 34). Moreover, we often cannot tell\nat the time when we exercise our power that we are doing so: happily\nwe sometimes find that much is accomplished in \u201ctimes when we\nthought ourselves indolent\u201d (CW3: 28).\n",
