    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cElias\u201d is the name of an author which, in the course of a\ncomplicated history of textual transmission, has become associated\nwith some manuscripts of late-antique commentaries on Aristotle and\nPorphyry. On the basis of a certain similarity in style and content,\nit is generally supposed that the works transmitted under the name of\n\u201cElias,\u201d just like the works attributed to\n\u201cDavid,\u201d emerged from the school of Olympiodorus at\nAlexandria and that the author lived and worked there in the second\nhalf of the 6th century CE. However, good evidence that a Neoplatonic\nphilosopher bearing the Christian monastic name \u201cElias\u201d\never existed is in fact scant. In this article \u201cElias\u201d is\nused to refer to the assumed author of the commentaries nowadays\nattributed to him. (See further below, section 3.)\n",
