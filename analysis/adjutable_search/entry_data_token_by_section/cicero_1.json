    "main_text": "Philosophy and Roman Society\n2. Philosophy and Roman Society\n\nAs a staunch republican himself, Cicero frequently despaired of the\nstate of the republic. Writing philosophy provided both consolation\nand a resource that, at least in more hopeful moments, he believed\ncould help ameliorate the political crisis. One of the things that\nmakes Cicero an interesting philosophical figure is his conviction\nthat philosophy has the potential to change lives and make societies\nbetter. This belief in philosophy\u2019s practical purpose explains\nwhy much, though by no means all, of Cicero\u2019s philosophical\nproduction has a broadly ethical or political orientation.\n\nThe social and political backdrop is important in another way too. One\nof Cicero\u2019s purposes in writing philosophy is to bring the best\nof the Greek philosophical inheritance to wider Roman attention. That\ndoes not, however, mean that his works are simple philosophical\nmanuals to be absorbed uncritically by their readership. A striking\nfeature of Cicero\u2019s philosophical output is that it takes\nseriously and critically the question of the relation between abstract\nideas, on the one hand, and the culture and tradition of particular\nsocieties (most saliently, for him, Rome), on the other.\n\nIndeed, Cicero treats this relation as bringing with it a set of\ndistinctly philosophical questions about, for example, the normative\nweight to be assigned to the deliverances of rational theology as\nagainst traditional religious practice (see section 7.3 below), or to\nthe precepts of an abstract ethical theory as against the\ntheory\u2019s liveability in a concrete society (section 7.2 below).\nHis discussions of the leading philosophical theories of his day tend\nto be used not for the purpose of firm advocacy of one particular set\nof doctrines or another, but to give his readers the tools to think\nthrough positions for themselves. Cicero\u2019s project of\ndisseminating philosophy has the aim of inducing what he saw as the\nproperly philosophical approach, one that is critical and\nopen-minded.\n",
