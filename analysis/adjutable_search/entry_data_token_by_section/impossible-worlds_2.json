    "main_text": "Applications of Impossible Worlds || Intentional States\n2.1 Intentional States\n\nModelling intentional states, such as knowledge and belief, is a\nprominent motivation for introducing impossible worlds. The intuitive\nidea is that one gains knowledge or belief by ruling out would-be\npossibilities (the epistemic/doxastic possibilities for that\nagent). An agent\u2019s knowledge is whatever is true according to\nall epistemically possible worlds accessible to that agent, i.e., the\nworlds which represent ways things could be, for all the agent knows\n(and similarly for belief).\n\nImpossible worlds are useful within this approach because these\nwould-be possibilities often turn out to be impossible. Our beliefs\nare often (covertly) inconsistent with one another. Moreover, our\nknowledge and belief is not closed under (classical) logical\nconsequence: we do not know or believe all consequences of what we\nknow or believe. It is hard to accommodate these features using only\npossible worlds. Possible worlds models usually generate the problem\nof logical omniscience (see\n epistemic logic),\n which we will discuss in\n section 5.3.\n\nOne feature of rational agents\u2019 intentional states is that they\ntypically reject obvious impossibility or absurdity whilst\nbeing subject to subtle inconsistency (Lewis 2004). One\nattempt to capture this feature is developed in Jago 2006, 2007, 2009,\n2014a. The idea is that only genuine possibilities and non-obvious\nimpossibilities should be epistemically accessible to rational (but\nimperfect) agents such as us. For some agents, it may be epistemically\npossible that Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u2019s is false, but 0\nbeing 1 shouldn\u2019t be epistemically possible for anyone.\nThat\u2019s why we know the latter but may fail to know the former,\nsays Jago. One worry with this approach is that it is partly\nproof-theoretic (invoking proof rules as relations between worlds),\nwhereas it isn\u2019t clear that proof length correlates well with\nobviousness. Bjerring (2013) presents other objections to the view. A\nstrategy similar to Jago\u2019s is adopted in Berto 2014, 2017.\n\nA quite different application of impossible worlds to epistemic states\nhas been proposed by JC Beall 2009, in relation to the\n Church-Fitch knowability paradox.\n The Church-Fitch reasoning is supposed to show that is contradictory\nto suppose that any truth can be known (as some anti-realists claim).\nThe reasoning is this. Suppose all truths are knowable but some are\nnot in fact known. Then some truth \\(A\\), is not known: \\(A \\wedge\n\\neg KA\\). By assumption, it\u2019s possible to know this: \\(\\Diamond\nK(A \\wedge \\neg KA)\\). Seemingly good reasoning (in classical\nepistemic logic) implies that it\u2019s possible both to know and not\nknow that \\(A\\): \\(\\Diamond(KA \\wedge \\neg KA)\\), which of course\nisn\u2019t possible at all. The usual moral to draw is that not all\ntruths are knowable. Beall\u2019s idea, by contrast, is that the\nknowability principle can be maintained (and the corresponding kind of\nanti-realism along with it). His suggestion is to deny\ndistribution of knowledge over conjunction: the principle\nthat knowing that \\(A \\wedge B\\) implies knowing that \\(A\\) and\nknowing that \\(B\\). He achieves this using impossible worlds in which\nconjunctions may be true even if their conjuncts are not.\n",
