    "main_text": "Russellian Monism in the History of Western Philosophy || Russellian Monism in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n2.2 Russellian Monism in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n\nContemporary Russellian monists often trace their view to\nRussell\u2019s 1927 The Analysis of Matter, which they read\nas developing a structuralist account of physics. Indeed, some find in\nthat book suggestions of not only structuralism about physics but the\nother main components of Russellian monism too (Lockwood 1992 [2015:\n144\u2013145]; Chalmers 1996: 166). On this interpretation, Russell\nthere implied that what are now called quiddities might be identified\nwith what he called percepts (Russell 1927a: 402). It has\nalso been argued that he more explicitly endorsed the eponymous theory\n(though not by its current name) in some of his later writings,\nincluding Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits and My\nPhilosophical Development (Wishon 2015; but see Stubenberg\n2015).\n\nSome argue that Russellian monism has historical roots not only in\nRussell\u2019s writings but also in early twentieth century works by\nArthur Eddington (Kadi\u0107 2017; cf. Strawson 2006a). In\nEddington\u2019s view, science does not describe what he calls the\nnature of the entities it posits, which he also refers to as\nthe background of \u201cpointer readings and similar\nindications\u201d (Eddington 1928: 252). For instance, he contends,\nphysics\u2014modern physics, as opposed to the physics of the\n\u201cVictorian physicist\u201d for whom \u201cAtoms were tiny\nbilliard balls\u2026\u201d\u2014describes atoms not in terms of\ntheir natures but rather in terms of pointer readings (Eddington 1928:\n259). Thus, like Russell, Eddington seems to affirm a version of\nstructuralism about physics (or something in the vicinity). Further,\nEddington proposes that atoms, and perhaps everything else physics\ndescribes, might have \u201csomething of spiritual nature of which a\nprominent characteristic is thought\u201d (Eddington 1928:\n259). In support of that proposal, he writes,\n\n\nBut in one case\u2014namely, for the pointer readings of my own\nbrain\u2014I have an insight which is not limited to the evidence of\nthe pointer readings. That insight shows that they are attached to a\nbackground of consciousness. Although I may expect that the background\nof other pointer readings in physics is of a nature continuous with\nthat revealed to me in this particular case, I do not suppose that it\nalways has the more specialized attributes of consciousness.\n(Eddington 1928: 259\u2013260)\n\n\nEddington\u2019s reflections can be seen as suggestive of either\nRussellian panpsychism (Kadi\u0107 2017: 46), Russellian\npanprotopsychism, or perhaps a hybrid of the two.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, Grover Maxwell (1978) and Michael\nLockwood (1989, 1992) each endorse a theory that they attribute to\nRussell and is often interpreted as Russellian monism (see, for\nexample, Chalmers 1996, 2013). Maxwell presents his theory in the\ncourse of defending the mind-brain identity theory (Place 1956; Smart\n1959; Lewis 1966; see the entry\n the mind/brain identity theory)\n against Saul Kripke\u2019s (1972) influential challenge.\nKripke\u2019s challenge concerns how to reconcile that identity\ntheory with the \u201capparent contingency of the connection between\nthe mental state and the corresponding brain state\u2026\u201d\n(Kripke 1972 [1980: 152]). Maxwell rejects an assumption on which, he\nclaims, that challenge relies: the assumption that \u201cwe know from\ncommon sense, from physics, from neurophysiology, etc., what brain\nevents are like\u201d (Maxwell 1978: 134). In his view, those sources\ntell us about structural properties but not about brain events\u2019\nunderlying non-structural properties\u2014a line of reasoning\nsuggestive of both structuralism about physics and realism about\nquiddities. He also seems to endorse something like quidditism about\nconsciousness. In the case of brain events that are, in his view,\nidentical to macrophenomenal experiences, he implies that their\nunderlying non-structural properties might be phenomenal\nproperties\u2014a claim suggestive of Russellian panpsychism.\nLockwood (1989, 1992) develops a theory similar to Maxwell\u2019s,\nremarking that it \u201cseems to me the only approach to the\nphilosophical mind\u2013body problem, currently on offer, that holds\nout the slightest promise\u201d (Lockwood 1992 [2015: 145]).\n\nMore recent discussions of Russellian monism have followed Maxwell and\nLockwood\u2019s lead. The view is advanced as offering a plausible\nresponse not only to Kripke\u2019s challenge but also to related\nanti-materialist arguments\n (section 3).\n Daniel Stoljar\u2019s \u201cTwo Conceptions of the Physical\u201d\n(2001) is widely considered the classic expression of that idea (see\nalso Stoljar 2006, 2009, 2014, 2015). The idea is also developed by\nChalmers (1996, 1997a, 2003, 2010: ch. 6, 10) and others (Rosenberg\n2004; Alter 2009, 2016; Montero 2010, 2015; Pereboom 2011, 2014, 2015,\n2016; McClelland 2013; Brown 2017; Goff 2017). Chalmers (1997a)\nintroduced the name \u201cRussellian monism,\u201d and his work on\nthe topic has been highly influential. Another main source of the\ncontemporary interest in Russellian monism is Galen Strawson\u2019s\n(2003, 2006a,b) seminal work on consciousness and physicalism.\n\n",
