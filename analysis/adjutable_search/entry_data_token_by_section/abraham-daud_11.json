    "main_text": "Main Themes in ER || Ethics and Religious Practice\n5.7 Ethics and Religious Practice\n\n\nIbn Daud has developed a philosophic conception of God who is\nabsolutely one and acts through intermediaries. From this God only good\ncan proceed, whereas evil is to be attributed to matter and to\nman\u2019s own bad choices. Once it has been established that man\nindeed has free choice with regard to moral conduct and that evil does\nnot come from God, there is no impediment for man to opt for the good\nlife. In his practical philosophy Ibn Daud expounds his view of the\nbest life. His point of departure is a description of the ethics of the\nphilosophers, which is a combination of Platonic psychology with\ncorresponding virtues to the concupiscent, vital and rational soul and\nthe Aristotelian conception of virtue as the proper mean between two\nextremes, a model that he borrows from Muslim philosophers.\n\n\nHe deviates, however, from the Platonic scheme by positing justice\ninstead of wisdom as the supreme cardinal virtue. Wisdom appears as\nthe virtue belonging to the theoretical intellect, but thanks to\njustice, which in Ibn Daud\u2019s interpretation is a mean that gives\neverything its due, man is able to attain bliss. Man can attain bliss,\nthe highest goal to which practical philosophy leads us, through moral\nperfection, which consists in perfecting his character, and in leading\na good family and social life. Justice is the highest virtue for it\neffects harmony between the various faculties of the soul in the\nindividual and forms the basis for man\u2019s social life. Not only is it a\nphilosophical virtue, but it is also a divine commandment, as can be\nderived from Micah 6:8. Justice indeed appears to be a key-notion in\nIbn Daud\u2019s ethics, for it also provides the basis for man\u2019s relation\nwith God, and thus, the rationale for fulfilling the commandments of\nthe Torah. Ibn Daud\u2019s reasoning is as follows: once it has been\nestablished that only good proceeds from God, it is a matter of\njustice that man requites his benefactor by serving God. The choice to\nserve God is consequent upon true knowledge of God, for such knowledge\nautomatically produces love in man, and love in turn requires action,\nthat is, divine worship which is achieved by accepting the\ncommandments of the Torah.\n\n\nLove and knowledge thus appear to be interrelated for one cannot\nlove what one does not know. Intellectual love of God has fear of God,\nin the sense of awe, as a corollary and automatically leads man to\ndivine worship. The Torah is the most perfect guide for leading a good\nmoral and religious life, for it contains commandments that help man to\nconstantly direct his actions towards God, as well as commandments that\nteach moral and social virtues. Moreover, it includes the so-called\nrevelational commandments that call for obedience. Even though no\nrational explanation can be found for them, man must accept them once\nreason has established that they belong to a true revelation, which has\nbeen brought by a true and morally perfect prophet.\n\n\nThis emphasis on religious practice in the last part of ER\nis consistent with Ibn Daud\u2019s statement in his introduction that\nthe goal of study is practical philosophy (ER W 4. S 8b).\nWhile the bulk of the book is concerned with philosophical speculation,\nby the end of it practical philosophy comes to occupy center stage.\nThis shift from philosophical speculation to religious praxis gains\nextra significance against the background of Judah Halevi\u2019s\nattack on the philosophical worldview in Kuzari I.1. According\nto Halevi, for the philosophers the highest good is conjunction with\nthe Active Intellect. Once man has attained this degree, it does not\nmatter which religion or which kind of divine worship he adopts.\nAlthough Ibn Daud does not mention Halevi by name, it is clear that he\nwas familiar with and used his work. In fact, his work can be seen as a\ndirect response to Halevi. Whereas Halevi regards philosophy as a\nthreat to religion, for Ibn Daud it is indispensable for it, since the\nstudy of philosophy induces man to accept religious commandments,\nincluding those whose rationale is obscure. Therefore, despite the\nextensive theoretical discussions, ER as a whole can be seen\nas a work of practical philosophy. Moreover, one may argue that the book is a\ndefense of philosophy as much as it is a defense of religion.\n",
