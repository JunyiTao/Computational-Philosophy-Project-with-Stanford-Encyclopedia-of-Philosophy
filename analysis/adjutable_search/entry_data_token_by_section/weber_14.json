    "main_text": "Politics and Ethics || Domination and Legitimacy\n6.1 Domination and Legitimacy\n\nSuch an ethical subtext is legible even in Weber\u2019s stark realism\nthat permeates his political sociology \u2013 or, a sociology of\ndomination (Herrschaftssoziologie) as he called it [for the\nacademic use of this term in Weber\u2019s time, see Anter 2016,\n3\u201323]. For instance, utterly devoid of moral qualities that many\nof his contemporaries attributed to the state, it is defined all too\nthinly as \u201ca human community that (successfully) claims the\nmonopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a\ngiven territory\u201d [Weber 1919/1994, 310]. With the same brevity,\nhe asserted that domination of the ruled by the ruler, or more\nliterally, \u201clordship\u201d (Herrschaft), is an\nimmutable reality of political life even in a democratic state. That\nis why, for Weber, an empirical study of politics cannot but be an\ninquiry into the different modalities by which domination is\neffectuated and sustained. All the while, he also maintained that a\ndomination worthy of sustained attention is about something far more\nthan the brute fact of subjugation and subservience. For \u201cthe\nmerely external fact of the order being obeyed is not sufficient to\nsignify domination in our sense; we cannot overlook the meaning of the\nfact that the command is accepted as a valid norm\u201d\n[Weber 1921\u201322/1978, 946]. In other words, it has to be a\ndomination mediated through justification and\ninterpretation in which the ruler\u2019s claim to authority,\nnot mere threat of force or promise of benefits, is the reason for the\nobedience, not mere compliance, by the ruled. This bipolar emphasis on\nthe factuality of coercive domination at the phenomenal level and the\nessentially noumenal nature of power (\u00e0 la Rainer\nForst) is what characterizes Weber\u2019s political realism [Forst\n2012].\n\nIn terms of contemporary political realism, Weber seemed to hold that\nthe primary concern of politics is the establishment of an\norderly domination and its management within a given\nterritory rather than the realization of such pre- or extra-political\nmoral goals as justice (Kant) or freedom (Hegel) \u2013 thus the\nbrevity with which the state is defined above. Sharing this Hobbesian\noutlook on politics, or what Bernard Williams calls the \u201cFirst\nPolitical Question\u201d (FPQ), enables Weber to square his diagnosis\nof agonistic value pluralism with an entrenched suspicion of\nnatural-law foundation of liberalism to sustain a democratic politics\nthat is uniquely his own [see 6.2 below]. He went beyond Ordorealism,\nhowever, when an evaluative perspective on politics is advocated\nwithout recourse to the moral commitments coming from outside the\npolitical sphere. The making of a workable political order cannot be\nauthorized by virtue of its coming-into-being and has to satisfy what\nWilliams called the \u201cBasic Legitimation Demand\u201d (BLD) to\nbe an acceptable arrangement of social coordination. A legitimate\npolitical order is an institutionalized modus vivendi for collective\nlife that \u201cmakes sense as an intelligible order\u201d (MSIO) in\nthe eyes of the beholder [Williams 2005, 1\u201317]. Since such an\nacceptance by those living under a particular arrangement depends on\nthe political morality animating that particular community, the\nruler\u2019s claim to authority can meet with success only when based\non a reasonable fit with the local mores, values, and cultures\n[Cozzaglio and Greene 2019, 1025\u201326]. Like Machiavelli\u2019s\nPrincipe, then, Weber\u2019s Herren do not behave\nin a normless vacuum. They rule under certain political-normative\nconstraints that turn on the congruence between the way their\ndomination is justified and the way such a public\njustification is interpreted as acceptable to the ruled.\nWeber\u2019s concept of domination is as much noumenal as phenomenal.\nTo that extent, it is little wonder that his name figures not only\nprominently but also uniquely in the pantheon of political realists\n[Galston 2010].\n\nFrom this nuanced realist premise, Weber famously moved on to identify\nthree ideal types of legitimate domination based on, respectively,\ncharisma, tradition, and legal rationality. Roughly, the first type of\nlegitimacy claim depends on how persuasively the leaders prove their\ncharismatic qualities, for which they receive personal devotions and\nemotive followings from the ruled. The second kind of claim can be\nmade successfully when certain practice, custom, and mores are\ninstitutionalized to (re)produce a stable pattern of domination over a\nlong duration of time. In contrast to these crucial dependences on\npersonality traits and the passage of time, the third type of\nauthority is unfettered by time, place, and other forms of contingency\nas it derives its legitimacy from adherence to impersonal rules and\ngeneral principles that can only be found by suitable legal-rational\nreasoning. It is, along with the traditional authority, a type of\ndomination that is inclined towards the status quo in ordinary times\nas opposed to the charismatic authority that represents extraordinary,\ndisruptive, and transformative forces in history. Weber\u2019s fame\nand influence as a political thinker are built most critically upon\nthis typology and the ways in which those ideal types are deployed in\nhis political writings.\n\nAs such, Weber\u2019s sociology of domination has been suspected\nvariously of its embedded normative biases. For one, his theory of\nlegitimacy is seen as endorsing a cynical and unrealistic rejection of\nuniversal morality in politics that makes it hard to pass an objective\nand moral evaluative judgment on legitimacy claims, a charge that is\ncommonly leveled at political realism at large. Under Weber\u2019s\nconcept of legitimacy, anything goes, so to speak, as long as the\nruler goes along with the local political morality of the ruled (even\nif it is formed independently of any coercive or corrosive\ninterference by the ruler, thereby satisfying Williams\u2019s\n\u201ccritical theory principle\u201d). Read in conjunction with his\nvoluminous political writings, especially, it is criticized to this\nday as harbouring or foreshadowing, among others, Bonapartist\ncaesarism, passive-revolutionary Fordist ideology, quasi-Fascist\nelitism, and even proto-Nazism (especially with respect to his robust\nnationalism and/or nihilistic celebration of power) [inter\nalia, Strauss 1950; Marcuse in Stammer (ed.) 1971; Mommsen 1984;\nRehman 2013]. In addition to these politically heated charges,\nWeber\u2019s typology also reveals a crucial lacuna even as an\nempirical political sociology. That is to say, it allows scant, or\nambiguous, a conceptual topos for democracy.\n\nIn fact, it seems as though Weber is unsure of the proper place of\ndemocracy in his schema. At one point, democracy is deemed as a\nfourth type of legitimacy because it should be able to\nembrace legitimacy from below whereas his three ideal types\nall focus on that from above [Breuer in Schroeder (ed.) 1998,\n2]. At other times, Weber seems to believe that democracy is simply\nnon-legitimate, rather than another type of legitimate\ndomination, because it aspires to an identity between the ruler and\nthe ruled (i.e., no domination at all), but without assuming a\nhierarchical and asymmetrical relationship of power, his concept of\nlegitimacy takes hardly off the ground. Thus, Weber could describe the\nemergence of proto-democracy in the late medieval urban communes only\nin terms of \u201crevolutionary usurpation\u201d [Weber\n1921\u201322/1978, 1250], calling them the \u201cfirst\ndeliberately non-legitimate and revolutionary political\nassociation\u201d [ibid., 1302]. Too recalcitrant to fit\ninto his overall schema, in other words, these historical prototypes\nof democracy simply fall outside of his typology of\ndomination as non- or not-legitimate at all.\n\nOverlapping but still distinguishable is Weber\u2019s yet another way\nof conceptualizing democracy, which had to do with charismatic\nlegitimacy. The best example is the Puritan sect in which authority is\nlegitimated only on the grounds of a consensual order created\nvoluntarily by proven believers possessing their own quantum of\ncharismatic legitimating power. As a result of this political\ncorollary of the Protestant doctrine of universal priesthood, Puritan\nsects could and did \u201cinsist upon \u2018direct democratic\nadministration\u2019 by the congregation\u201d and thereby do away\nwith the hierarchical distinction between those ruling and those ruled\n[ibid., 1208]. In a secularized version of this group\ndynamics, a democratic ballot would become the primary tool by which\npresumed charisma of the individual lay citizenry are aggregated and\ntransmitted to their elected leader who become \u201cthe agent and\nhence the servant of his voters, not their chosen master\u201d\n[ibid., 1128]. Rather than an outright non-legitimate or\nfourth type of domination, here, democracy comes across as an\nextremely rare subset of a diffused and institutionalized form of\ncharismatic legitimacy.\n",
