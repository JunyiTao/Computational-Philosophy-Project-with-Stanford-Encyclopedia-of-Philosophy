    "main_text": "Inferential Theories of Causation || Deductive Nomological Approaches\n2.1 Deductive Nomological Approaches\n\nInherent in the philosophy of logical empiricism, broadly construed,\nis a strong opposition to traditional metaphysics. Not surprisingly,\nmany of the logical empiricists were guided by Humean empiricist\nprinciples. Even some concepts of scientific language were suspected\nto be metaphysical in nature. Wittgenstein (1922: 5.136) held that\nbelief in a general law of causality is superstition. He also denied\nthat laws of nature could explain natural phenomena (6.371n). Frank\n(1932: Ch. V, IX) pointed out several difficulties in giving a precise\nformulation of a general law of causality. Russell (1913) argued that\nthe notion of cause is beset with confusion, and should better be\nexcluded from philosophical vocabulary.\n\nRamsey (1931) was less sceptical than Russell (1913) and Wittgenstein\n(1922) about the prospect of an analysis of causation. His account of\ncausation seems to be the logical empiricist analysis that comes\nclosest to Hume\u2019s original analysis. It is centred on the notion\nof a variable hypothetical. Such a hypothetical is a\nuniversally quantified implication that has instances whose truth or\nfalsity we are unable to verify for now. A case in point is the\nsentence saying that all humans are mortal. This sentence goes beyond\nour finite experience. For there is no way to conclusively establish\nthat all men\u2014past, present and future\u2014are mortal.\n\nTo believe a universal hypothetical consists in \u201ca general\nenunciation\u201d and \u201ca habit of singular belief\u201d\n(Ramsey 1931: 241). That is, we are willing to believe instances of\nthe universal sentence, even though we are not able to verify them at\nthe moment. Ramsey builds here Humean ideas about the formation of a\nhabit or custom into an informal semantics of universal sentences.\n\nRamsey\u2019s account, then, amounts to the following analysis. \\(C\\)\nis a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are actual,\n(ii)\nthe implication \\(C \\rightarrow E\\) follows from a variable\nhypothetical \\(\\forall x (\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\psi(x))\\) and certain\nfacts \\(F\\),\n(iii)\nthe events described by \\(E\\) are not earlier than the events\ndescribed by \\(C\\) and \\(F\\),\n(iv)\n\\((C \\wedge F) \\rightarrow E\\) is an instance of \\(\\forall x\n(\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\psi(x))\\), and\n(v)\n\\(\\forall x (\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\psi(x))\\) is believed, or we are\nled to believe it in light of future observations (Ramsey 1931:\n249).\n\n\nCondition (i) remains implicit, but it would be confusing to omit it\nhere. Strictly speaking, condition (ii) is redundant since it follows\nfrom condition (iv).\n\nNote that a regularity by itself need not give rise to a variable\nhypothetical that we believe or are led to believe by future\nobservations. A case in point is the regular connection between the\nsound of the hooters at a factory in Manchester and the workers going\nhome at a factory in London (see\n \u00a71.3).\n Ramsey (1931: 242) literally speaks of trust in order to characterize\nour epistemic attitude towards causal laws. Ramsey\u2019s account of\nsuch laws, which supersedes his earlier best systems analysis, is\nexplicitly epistemic. However, Ramsey\u2019s account does not seem to\nhave the resources to address the problem of singular causal\nrelations. Under which causal law could we subsume the causal\nhypothesis that dinosaurs became extinct by a collision of the Earth\nwith a meteor?\n\nMore work on causation and explanation has been done within the\nlogical empiricist program. The deductive nomological model of\nexplanation by Hempel and Oppenheim (1948)\u2014also referred to as\nthe DN model of explanation\u2014seems to give us an exemplar of a\nconceptual analysis without metaphysics. Let us briefly recall the\nbasic elements of this model. The explanans of an empirical phenomenon\n\\(E\\) consists of two types of statements. First, a set \\(C\\) of\nantecedent conditions \\(C_1, \\ldots, C_k\\). Second, a set \\(L\\) of\nlaws \\(L_1, \\ldots, L_r\\). These two sets form the explanans,\nwhile \\(E\\) is called the explanandum. \\(C\\) and \\(L\\)\nexplain \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(E\\) is a logical consequence of the union of \\(C\\) and\n\\(L\\),\n(ii)\n\\(L\\) is non-empty (while \\(C\\) may be empty),\n(iii)\nthe explanans is testable, and\n(iv)\neach member of \\(C\\) and \\(L\\) is true.\n\n\nThe explanandum must thereby be subsumed under at least one law.\n\nWhile Hempel and Oppenheim were not primarily interested in an\nanalysis of causation, they thought that the DN model may yield such\nan analysis:\n\n\nThe type of explanation which has been considered here so far is often\nreferred to as causal explanation. If \\(E\\) describes a particular\nevent, then the antecedent circumstances described in the sentences\n\\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k\\) may be said jointly to \u201ccause\u201d\nthat event, in the sense that there are certain empirical\nregularities, expressed by the laws \\(L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_r\\), which\nimply that whenever conditions of the kind indicated by \\(C_1, C_2,\n\\ldots, C_k\\) occur, an event of the type described in \\(E\\) will take\nplace. Statements such as \\(L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_r\\), which assert\ngeneral and unexceptional connections between specified\ncharacteristics of events, are customarily called causal, or\ndeterministic, laws. (Hempel & Oppenheim 1948: 139)\n\n\nThis passage nicely indicates how inferential approaches to causation\nparallel regularity approaches. The regular connection between the\npresumed cause and the putative effect is expressed by certain laws.\nThe putative effect must be inferable from the presumed cause using\nthese laws if the former is an actual cause of the latter. Causation\nimplies that there are covering laws, according to which the cause is\nsufficient for its effect (cf. Pap 1952 and Davidson 1967, 1995). At\nthe same time, the above passage reveals logical empiricist scruples\nto talk about causation. Hempel and Oppenheim are hesitant to set\nforth the DN model as an analysis of causation and to say that the\nantecedent conditions of a DN explanation are causes of the\nexplanandum if the latter is a particular event.\n\nMore than a decade later than the first publication of the DN model,\nHempel (1965: 351n) suggested replacing the notion of cause by the\nnotion of antecedent conditions along the lines of the DN model.\nMoreover, he then distinguishes more carefully between laws of\nsuccession and laws of coexistence (1965: 352). Only the\nformer give rise to causal explanations. If a DN explanation is based\non laws of coexistence, this explanation does not qualify as causal. A\ncase in point is the law that connects the length of a pendulum with\nits period: \n\n\\[T=2 \\pi \\sqrt{l/g}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the period of the pendulum, \\(l\\) its length, and \\(g\\)\nthe gravitational acceleration nearby the surface of the Earth.\n\nArguably, even laws of succession do not always give rise to causal\nexplanations. Such laws do not only allow for predictions, but also\nfor retrodictions. That is, we can derive statements about events that\nare prior to events described by the antecedent conditions \\(C_1,\\)\n\\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_k\\) in a DN explanation. Hempel (1965: 353)\nhimself observed that Fermat\u2019s principle may be used in a DN\nexplanation of an event that precedes an event described by an\nantecedent condition.\n\nIn sum, there are at least two problems with a simple DN account of\ncausation. First, DN explanations using laws of coexistence do not\nseem to qualify as causal. Second, in some DN explanations, the\nexplanandum is an event that occurs prior to an event described in the\nantecedent conditions. In neither case, we view the antecedent\nconditions of the DN explanation as cause of the event to be\nexplained.\n\nThese observations anticipate later criticisms of the DN model, which\nare commonly referred to as symmetry problems. In the case of\nthe infamous tower-shadow example, most people have come to view only\nthe derivation of the length of the shadow as properly explanatory,\nbut not the derivation of the height of the tower (Bromberger 1966).\nHempel (1965: 353n) himself admits that causal DN explanations seem\n\u201cmore natural and plausible\u201d than non-causal ones.\nWoodward (2003) goes a step further by expounding a causal account of\nexplanation using causal models.\n\nWe must wonder why Hempel did not define that \\(C\\) is a cause of a\nparticular event \\(E\\) iff there is a DN explanation of \\(E\\) such\nthat \\(E\\) is the explanandum, \\(C\\) is among the antecedent\nconditions, all antecedent conditions precede the occurrence of \\(E\\),\nand all laws are laws of succession. Presumably, his interest in an\nanalysis of causation was limited.\n",
