Some Historical and Theoretical Context\n\nAlthough one might find precursors to causal theories of mental\ncontent scattered throughout the history of philosophy, the current\ninterest in the topic was spurred, in part, by perceived inadequacies\nin \u201csimilarity\u201d or \u201cpicture\u201d theories of\nmental representation. Where meaning and representation are asymmetric\nrelations\u2014that is, a syntactic item \u201cX\u201d might mean\nor represent X, but X does not (typically) mean or represent\n\u201cX\u201d\u2014similarity and resemblance are symmetric\nrelations. Dennis Stampe (1977), who played an important role in\ninitiating contemporary interest in causal theories, drew attention to\nrelated problems. Consider a photograph of one of two identical twins.\nWhat makes it a photo of Judy, rather than her identical twin Trudy?\nBy assumption, it cannot be the similarity of the photo to one twin\nrather than the other, since the twins are identical. Moreover, one\ncan have a photo of Judy even though the photo happens not to look\nvery much like her at all. What apparently makes a photo of Judy a\nphoto of Judy is that she was causally implicated, in the right way,\nin the production of the photo. Reinforcing the hunch that causation\ncould be relevant to meaning and representation is the observation\nthat there is a sense in which the number of rings in a tree stump\nrepresents the age of the tree when it died and that the presence of\nsmoke means fire. The history of contemporary developments of causal\ntheories of mental content consists largely of specifying what it is\nfor something to be causally implicated in the right way in the\nproduction of meaning and refining the sense in which smoke represents\nfire to the sense in which a person\u2019s thoughts, sometimes at\nleast, represent the world.\n\nIf one wanted to trace a simple historical arc for recent causal\ntheories, one would have to begin with the seminal 1977 paper by\nDennis Stampe, \u201cToward a Causal Theory of Linguistic\nRepresentation.\u201d Among the many important features of this paper\nis its having set much of the conceptual and theoretical stage to be\ndescribed in greater detail below. It drew a contrast between causal\ntheories and \u201cpicture theories\u201d that try to explain\nrepresentational content by appeal to some form of similarity between\na representation and the thing represented. It also drew attention to\nthe problem of distinguishing the content determining causes of a\nrepresentation from adventitious non-content determining causes. So,\nfor example, one will want \u201cX\u201d to mean dogs because dogs\ncauses dogs, but one does not want \u201cX\u201d to mean\nblow-to-the-head, even though blows to the head might cause the\noccurrence of an \u201cX\u201d. (Much more of this will be described\nbelow.) Finally, it also provided some attempts to address this\nproblem, such as an appeal to the function a thing might have.\n\nFred Dretske\u2019s 1981 Knowledge and the Flow of\nInformation offered a much expanded treatment of a type of causal\ntheory. Rather than basing semantic content on a causal connection\nper se, Dretske began with a type of informational connection\nderived from the mathematical theory of information. This has led some\nto refer to Dretske\u2019s theory as \u201cinformation\nsemantics\u201d. Dretske also appealed to the notion of function in\nan attempt to distinguish content determining causes from adventitious\nnon-content determining causes. This has led some to refer to\nDretske\u2019s theory as a \u201cteleoinformational\u201d theory or\na \u201cteleosemantic\u201d theory. Dretske\u2019s 1988 book,\nExplaining Behavior, further refined his earlier\ntreatment.\n\nJerry Fodor\u2019s 1984 \u201cSemantics, Wisconsin Style\u201d gave\nthe problem of distinguishing content-determining causes from\nnon-content determining causes its best-known guise as \u201cthe\ndisjunction problem\u201d. How can a causal theory of content say\nthat \u201cX\u201d has the non-disjunctive content dog, rather than\nthe disjunctive content dog-or-blow-to-the-head, when both dogs and\nblows to the head cause instances of \u201cX\u201d? By 1987, in\nPsychosemantics, Fodor published his first attempt at an\nalternative method of solving the disjunction problem, the Asymmetric\n(Causal) Dependency Theory. This theory was further refined for the\ntitle essay in Fodor\u2019s 1990 book A Theory of Content and\nOther Essays.\n\nAlthough these causal theories have subsequently spawned a significant\ncritical literature, other related causal theories have also been\nadvanced. Two of these are teleosemantic theories that are sometimes\ncontrasted with causal theories. (Cf., e.g., Papineau (1984), Millikan\n(1989), and the entry on \n  teleological theories of mental content.) \nOther more purely causal theories are Dan Lloyd\u2019s (1987, 1989)\nDialectical Theory of Representation, Robert Rupert\u2019s (1999)\nBest Test Theory (see section 3.5 below), Marius Usher\u2019s (2001)\nStatistical Referential Theory, and Dan Ryder\u2019s (2004) SINBAD\nneurosemantics.\n\nCausal theories of mental content are typically developed in the\ncontext of four principal assumptions. First, they typically\npresuppose that there is a difference between derived and underived\n meaning.[2]\n Normal humans can use one thing, such as \u201c%\u201d, to mean\npercent. They can use certain large red octagons to mean that one is\nto stop at an intersection. In such cases, there are collective\narrangements that confer relatively specific meanings on relatively\nspecific objects. In the case of human minds, however, it is proposed\nthat thoughts can have the meanings or contents they do without\nrecourse to collective arrangements. It is possible to think about\npercentage or ways of negotiating intersections prior to collective\nsocial arrangements. It, therefore, appears that the contents of our\nthoughts do not acquire the content they do in the way that\n\u201c%\u201d and certain large red octagons do. Causal theories of\nmental content presuppose that mental contents are underived, hence\nattempt to explain how underived meaning arises.\n\nSecond, causal theories of mental content distinguish what has come to\nbe known as natural meaning and non-natural\n meaning.[3]\n Cases where an object or event X has natural meaning are those in\nwhich, given certain background conditions, the existence or\noccurrence of X \u201centails\u201d the existence or occurrence of\nsome state of affairs. If smoke in the unspoiled forest naturally\nmeans fire then, given the presence of smoke, there was fire. Under\nthe relevant background conditions, the effect indicates or naturally\nmeans the cause. An important feature of natural meaning is that it\ndoes not generate falsity. If smoke naturally means fire, then there\nmust really be a fire. By contrast, many non-naturally meaningful\nthings can be false. Sentences, for example, can be meaningful and\nfalse. The utterance \u201cColleen currently has measles\u201d means\nthat Colleen currently has measles but does not entail that Colleen\ncurrently has measles in the way that Colleen\u2019s spots do entail\nthat she has measles. Like sentences, thoughts are also meaningful,\nbut often false. Thus, it is generally supposed that mental content\nmust be a form of non-natural underived\n meaning.[4]\n\nThird, these theories assume that it is possible to explain the origin\nof underived content without appeal to other semantic or contentful\nnotions. So, it is assumed that there is more to the project than\nsimply saying that one\u2019s thoughts mean that Colleen currently\nhas the measles because one\u2019s thoughts are about Colleen\ncurrently having the measles. Explicating meaning in terms of\naboutness, or aboutness in terms of meaning, or either in terms of\nsome still further semantic notion, does not go as far as is commonly\ndesired by those who develop causal theories of mental content. To\nnote some additional terminology, it is often said that causal\ntheories of mental content attempt to naturalize non-natural,\nunderived meaning. To put the matter less technically, one might say\nthat causal theories of mental content presuppose that it is possible\nfor a purely physical system to bear underived content. Thus, they\npresuppose that if one were to build a genuinely thinking robot or\ncomputer, one would have to design it in such a way that some of its\ninternal components would bear non-natural, underived content in\nvirtue of purely physical conditions. To get a feel for the difference\nbetween a naturalized theory and an unnaturalized theory of content,\none might note the theory developed by Grice (1948). Grice developed\nan unnaturalized theory. Speaking of linguistic items, Grice held that\n\u2018Speaker S non-naturally means something by\n\u201cX\u201d\u2019 is roughly equivalent to \u2018S intended the\nutterance of \u201cX\u201d to produce some effect in an audience by\nmeans of the recognition of this intention.\u2019 Grice did not\nexplicate the origin of mental content of speaker\u2019s intentions\nor audience recognition, hence he did not attempt to naturalize the\nmeaning of linguistic items.\n\nFourth, it is commonly presupposed that naturalistic analyses of\nnon-natural, underived meanings will apply, in the first instance,\nto the contents of thought. The physical items \u201cX\u201d that\nare supposed to be bearers of causally determined content will,\ntherefore, be something like the firings of a particular neuron or set\nof neurons. These contents of thoughts are said to be captured in what\nis sometimes called a \u201clanguage of thought\u201d or\n\u201cmentalese.\u201d The contents of items in natural languages,\nsuch as English, Japanese, and French, will then be given a separate\nanalysis, presumably in terms of a naturalistic account of non-natural\nderived meanings. It is, of course, possible to suppose that it is\nnatural language, or some other system of communication, that first\ndevelops content, which can then serve as a basis upon which to\nprovide an account of mental content. Among the reasons that threaten\nthis order of dependency is the fact that cognitive agents appear to\nhave evolved before systems of communication. Another reason is that\nhuman infants at least appear to have some sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities involving mental representation, before they speak or\nunderstand natural languages. Yet another reason is that, although\nsome social animals may have systems of communication complex enough\nto support the genesis of mental content, other non-social cognizing\nanimals may not.\n\nIt is worth noting that, in recent years, this last presupposition has\nsometimes been abandoned by philosophers attempting to understand\nanimal signaling or animal communication, as when toads emit mating\ncalls or vervet monkeys cry out when seeing a cheetah, eagle, or\nsnake. See, for example, Stegmann, 2005, 2009, Skyrms, 2008, 2010a, b,\n2012, and Birch, 2014. In other words, there have been efforts to use\nthe sorts of apparatus originally developed for theories of mental\ncontent, plus or minus a bit, as apparatus for handling animal\nsignaling. These approaches seem to allow that there are mental\nrepresentations in the brains of the signaling/communicating animals,\nbut do not reply on the content of the mental representations to\nprovide the representational contents of the signals. In this way, the\ncontents of the signals are not derived from the contents of the\nmental representations.\n",
