    "main_text": "The Union of Opposites\n5. The Union of Opposites\n\nHamann\u2019s tool for conceiving the interrelation of these\ndimensions of human life increasingly was the Principle of the Union\nof Opposites. He writes approvingly of this principle to his friends;\nparticularly after his encounter with Kant\u2019s new epistemology,\nclaiming to value it more than the principles of contradiction and of\nsufficient reason, and indeed more than the whole Kantian Critique (ZH\n5, 327:12ff; ZH 4, 462:7\u20138). Contradictions and apparent\noppositions fill our experience:\n\nYes, daily at home I have the experience that one must always\ncontradict oneself from two viewpoints, [which] never can agree, and\nthat it is impossible to change these viewpoints into the other\nwithout doing the greatest violence to them. Our knowledge is\npiecemeal \u2014 no dogmatist is in a position to feel this great\ntruth, if he is to play his role and play it well; and through a\nvicious circle of pure reason skepsis itself becomes dogma (ZH 5,\n432:29\u201336). (This is in the context of a discussion of\nKant.)\n\nFar from being a pre-condition for truth, the absence of contradiction\nis in Hamann\u2019s eyes a pre-condition for dogmatism. Knowledge\nmust not proceed on the basis of unanimity and the absence of\ncontradiction, but must proceed through the dialogue and relation of\nthese different voices. (Hamann does not think in terms of\nHegel\u2019s later dialectical synthesis.) When Hamann speaks of\n\u2018opposition\u2019 and contradictions, however, he does so in an\nironic tone; for it is clearly his conviction that there is a\nfundamental unity in things, and the oppositions and contradictions\nthat we perceive are chiefly of our own making. He insists that his\nperception is \u2018without Manichaeism\u2019 (ZH 5,\n327:16\u201317). Body and mind, senses and reason, reason and passion\nare not truly opposed. These are contrasting elements of the same\nunified \u2014 unified but not homogenous \u2014 reality. Hamann\ntries to steer a course between Scylla and Charybdis: between the\ndogmatic, even tyrannical extermination of opposition and\ncontradiction; and the elimination of contradiction through a false\nsynthesis or fusion achieved by an apparent acceptance of antithetical\nrealities.\n\nThe Principle of the Union of Opposites as a tactical tool, therefore,\ndoes not imply that Hamann sees the world in terms of divisions and\ndualism. It is his strategy for coping with the schematic antitheses\nabundant in Enlightenment philosophy.\n\nNothing seems easier than the leap from one extreme to the other, and\nnothing so difficult as the union to a center. \u2026 [The Union of\nOpposites] always seems to me to be the one sufficient reason of all\ncontradictions \u2014 and the true process of their resolution and\nmediation, that makes an end to all feuds of healthy reason and pure\nunreason.
