    "main_text": "The Monarchia\n6. The Monarchia\n\nAlthough there remains some dispute about the date of the\nMonarchia\u2019s composition (probably after 1314), it is\nclear that, unlike the Convivio and the De vulgari\neloquentia, the Monarchia was completed and disseminated\nin Dante\u2019s own lifetime\u2014though, evidently, it was not\nwidely circulated until the late 1320\u2019s, when it came to be\ndeployed as propaganda supporting Louis IV\u2019s claim to the title\nof Holy Roman Emperor [Cassell (2004), 33\u201349].\n\nRegardless of the uses to which it was later put, the\nMonarchia is in its own way as idiosyncratic as the\nConvivio. Its purpose, foreshadowed in the discussion of\nempire in Convivio IV, is to demonstrate the necessity of a\nsingle ruling power, reverent toward but independent of the Church,\ncapable of ordering the will of collective humanity in peace and\nconcord. Under such a power the potential intellect of humanity can be\nfully actuated\u2014the intellect, that is, of collective humanity,\nexistent throughout the world, acting as one. For just as a multitude\nof species must continually be generated to actualize the full\npotentiality of prime matter, so the full intellectual capacity of\nhumanity cannot be realized at one time nor in a single individual\n[Mon. 1.3.3\u20138]. Here Dante adds his own further\nparticularization of this Aristotelian doctrine [De Anima\n3.5, 430a10\u201315], asserting that no single household, community,\nor city can bring it to realization. The ordering of the collective\nhuman will to the goal of realizing its intellectual potential\nrequires universal peace [1.4], and this in turn requires a single\nordering power through whose authority humanity may achieve unity and\nso realize the intention and likeness of God [1.8].\n\nThe basis of this argument for empire is evidently the first sentence\nof the Prologue to Thomas\u2019 commentary on the\nMetaphysics, where he declares that when several things are\nordered to a single end, one of them must govern, \u201cas the\nPhilosopher teaches in his Politics\u201d [Thomas, Exp.\nMetaph., Proemium; Aristotle, Politics 1.5,\n1254a\u201355a]. For Thomas this is only an analogy, a way of\nintroducing the theme of order as it applies to the soul and its\npursuit of happiness. The passage he cites from the Politics\nis concerned only with the rudiments of hierarchy; the idea of\n\u201cordering of things to one end\u201d is present only by\nimplication, and Aristotle makes no attempt to develop its\nmetaphysical implications. Dante, however, seems clearly to associate\nwith Aristotle, or with Thomas\u2019 reference to Aristotle, the idea\nof \u201ca political organization which leads in its way to\n\u2018beatitudo\u2019 for the whole human race\u201d\n[Minio-Paluello, 74\u201377]. One may wonder if Dante\u2019s\nerroneous impression of the Aristotelian passage, which he cites\ndirectly with no reference to Thomas in both the Convivio and\nthe Monarchia [Conv. 4.4.5; Mon.\n1.5.2\u20133], is not a symptom of his intense need to draw the\nPhilosopher into support of his view of world empire.\n\nThe second of the Monarchia\u2019s three books deals with\nthe great example of Rome, describing the city\u2019s providential\nrole in world history, largely by way of citations from Roman\nliterature aimed at demonstrating the consistent dedication of Roman\npower to the public good, and the conformity of Roman\nimperium with the order of nature and the will of God.\n\nThe third book deals with the crucial issue of the relationship\nbetween political and ecclesiastical authority. Dante argues on\nvarious grounds that power in the temporal realm is neither derived\nfrom nor dependent on spiritual authority, though it benefits from the\npower of the Papacy to bless its activity. These arguments consist\nlargely in refutations of traditional claims for the temporal\nauthority of the Papacy, but the final chapter makes the argument on\npositive grounds and in terms that recall the arguments first laid\ndown in the Convivio. Since the human being consists of soul\nand body, its nature partakes of both the corruptible and the\nincorruptible. Uniting two natures, human existence must necessarily\nbe ordered to the goals of both these natures [Mon.\n3.16.7\u20139]:\n\nIneffable providence has thus set before us two goals to aim at: i.e.\nhappiness in this life, which consists in the exercise of our own\npowers and is figured in the earthly paradise; and happiness in the\neternal life, which consists in the enjoyment of the vision of God (to\nwhich our own powers cannot raise us except with the help of\nGod\u2019s light) and which is signified by the heavenly paradise.\nNow these two kinds of happiness must be reached by different means,\nas representing different ends. For we attain the first through the\nteachings of philosophy, provided that we follow them putting into\npractice the moral and intellectual virtues; whereas we attain the\nsecond through spiritual teachings which transcend human reason,\nprovided that we follow them putting into practice the theological\nvirtues, i.e. faith, hope, and charity. These ends and the means to\nattain them have been shown to us on the one hand by human reason,\nwhich has been entirely revealed to us by the philosophers, and on the\nother by the Holy Spirit\u2026\n\n\nThis is Dante\u2019s most explicit, uncompromising claim for the\nautonomy of reason, reinforced by the entire world-historical argument\nof the Monarchia and constituting its final justification for\nworld empire. Dante here goes well beyond Augustine\u2019s sense of\nthe stabilizing function of empire, and eliminates any hint of the\nanti-Roman emphasis in Augustine\u2019s separation of the earthly and\nheavenly cities. In the final sentences of the Monarchia the\ntemporal monarch becomes, like the aspiring intellect of the\nConvivio, the uniquely privileged beneficiary of a divine\nbounty which, \u201cwithout any intermediary, descends into him from\nthe Fountainhead of universal authority\u201d [Mon.\n3.16.15]. Like the Averroistic reasoning of his earlier claim that\nonly under a world empire can humanity realize its intellectual\ndestiny, this crowning claim shows Dante appropriating Aristotle to\nthe service of a unique and almost desperate vision of empire as a\nredemptive force.\n",
