Developments in Philosophy of Information\n\nThe modern theories of information emerged in the middle of the\ntwentieth century in a specific intellectual climate in which the\ndistance between the sciences and parts of academic philosophy was\nquite big. Some philosophers displayed a specific anti-scientific\nattitude: Heidegger, \u201cDie Wissenschaft denkt\nnicht.\u201d On the other hand the philosophers from the Wiener\nKreis overtly discredited traditional philosophy as dealing with\nillusionary problems (Carnap 1928). The research program of logical\npositivism was a rigorous reconstruction of philosophy based on a\ncombination of empiricism and the recent advances in logic. It is\nperhaps because of this intellectual climate that early important\ndevelopments in the theory of information took place in isolation from\nmainstream philosophical reflection. A landmark is the work of Dretske\nin the early eighties (Dretske 1981). Since the turn of the century,\ninterest in Philosophy of Information has grown considerably, largely\nunder the influence of the work of Luciano Floridi on semantic\ninformation. Also the rapid theoretical development of quantum\ncomputing and the associated notion of quantum information have had it\nrepercussions on philosophical reflection.\n",
