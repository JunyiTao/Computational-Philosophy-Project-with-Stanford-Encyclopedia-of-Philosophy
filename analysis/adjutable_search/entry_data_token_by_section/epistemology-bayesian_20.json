    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (II): The Problem of the Priors || Objective Bayesianism\n4.2 Objective Bayesianism\n\nObjective Bayesians contend that, in addition to coherence,\nthere is another epistemic virtue or ideal that needs to be codified\ninto a norm for prior credences: freedom from bias and avoidance of\noverly strong opinions (Jeffreys 1939; Carnap 1945; Jaynes 1957, 1968;\nRosenkrantz 1981; J. Williamson 2010). This view is often motivated by\na case like this:\n\n\nExample (Six-Faced Die). Suppose that there is\na cubic die with six faces that look symmetric, and we are going to\ntoss it. Suppose further that we have no other idea about this die.\nNow, what should our credence be that the die will come up 6?\n\n\n\nAn intuitive answer is \\(1/6\\), for it seems that we ought to\ndistribute our credences evenly, with an equal credence, \\(1/6\\), in\neach of the six possible outcomes. While subjective Bayesians would\nonly say that we may do so, objective Bayesians would make\nthe stronger claim that we ought to do so. More generally,\nobjective Bayesians are sympathetic to this norm:\n\n\nThe Principle of Indifference. A\nperson\u2019s credences in any two propositions should be equal if\nher total evidence no more supports one than the other (the\nevidential symmetry version), or if she has no sufficient\nreason to have a higher credence in one than in the other (the\ninsufficient reason version).\n\n\n\nA standard worry about the Indifference Principle comes from\nBertrand\u2019s paradox. Here is a simplified version\n(adapted from van Fraassen 1989):\n\n\nExample (Square). Suppose that there is a\nsquare and that we know for sure that its side length is between 1 and\n4 centimeters. Suppose further that we have no other idea about that\nsquare. Now, how confident should we be that the square has a side\nlength between 1 and 2 centimeters?\n\n\n\nNow, have a look at the two groups of propositions listed in the table\nbelow. The left group (1)\u2013(3) focuses on possible side lengths\nand divides up possibilities by 1-cm-long intervals; the right group\n\\((1')\\)\u2013\\((15')\\) focuses on possible areas instead:\n\n\n\n\nPartition By\nLength\nPartition By\nArea  \n\n\n(1) The side length is 1 to 2 cm.\n\\((1')\\) The area is 1 to 2\ncm2. \n\n(2) The side length is 2 to 3 cm.\n\\((2')\\) The area is 2 to 3\ncm2. \n\n(3) The side length is 3 to 4 cm.\n\\((3')\\) The area is 3 to 4\ncm2. \n\n\n\\(\\;\\;\\vdots\\) \n\n\n\\((15')\\) The area is 15 to 16\ncm2  \n\n\n\nThe Indifference Principle seems ask us to assign a \\(1/3\\) credence\nto each proposition in the left group \\((1)\\)\u2013\\((3)\\) and,\nsimultaneously, assign \\(1/15\\) to each one in the right group\n\\((1')\\)\u2013\\((15')\\). If so, it asks us to assign unequal\ncredences to equivalent propositions: \\(1/3\\) to \\((1)\\), and \\(3/15\\)\nto the disjunction \\((1') \\!\\vee (2') \\!\\vee (3')\\). That violates\nProbabilism.\n\nIn reply, objective Bayesians may reply that Bertrand\u2019s paradox\nprovides no conclusive reason against the Indifference Principle and\nperhaps the fault lies elsewhere. Following White (2010), let\u2019s\nthink about how the Indifference Principle works: it outputs a\nnormative recommendation for credence assignment only when it receives\none or another input, which is a judgement about insufficient\nreason or evidential symmetry. Indeed, Bertrand\u2019s paradox has to\nbe generated by at least two inputs, such as, first, the\nlack-of-evidence judgement about the left group in the above table\nand, second, that about the right group. So perhaps the fault lies not\nwith the Indifference Principle but with one of the two\ninputs\u2014after all, garbage in, garbage out. White (2010)\nsubstantiates the above idea with an argument to this effect: at least\none of the two inputs in Bertrand\u2019s paradox must be mistaken,\nbecause they already contradict each other even when we only assume\ncertain weak, plausible principles that have nothing to do with\ncredences and concern just the evidential support relation.\n\nThere still remains the task of developing a systematic account to\nguide one\u2019s judgments of evidential symmetry (or insufficient\nreason) before those judgments are passed as inputs to the\nIndifference Principle. An important source of inspiration has been\nthe symmetry in the Six-Faced Die Case: it is a kind of\nphysical symmetry due to the cubic shape of the die; it is\nalso a kind of permutation symmetry because nothing essential\nchanges when the six faces of the die are relabeled. Those two aspects\nof the symmetry\u2014physical and permutational\u2014are extended by\ntwo influential approaches to the Indifference Principle,\nrespectively, which are presented in turn below.\n\nThe first approach to the Indifference Principle looks for a wider\nrange of physical symmetries, including especially the\nsymmetries associated with a change of coordinate or unit. This\napproach, developed by Jeffreys (1946) and Jaynes (1968, 1973), yields\na consistent, somewhat surprising answer 1/2 (rather than 1/3 or 1/15)\nto the question in the Square Case. See\n supplement C\n for some non-technical details.\n\nThe second approach to the Indifference Principle focuses on\npermutation symmetries and proposes to look for those not in\na physical system but in the language in use. This approach\nis due to Carnap (1945, 1955). He maintains, for example, that two\nsentences ought to be assigned equal prior credences if one differs\nfrom the other only by a permutation of the names in use. Although\nCarnap says little about the Square Case, he has much to say about how\nhis approach to the Indifference Principle helps to justify\nenumerative induction; see the survey by Fitelson (2006). So objective\nBayesianism is often regarded as a substantive account of inductive\ninference, while many subjective Bayesians often take their view as a\nquantitative analogue of deductive logic (as presented in\n section 4.1).\n For refinement of Carnap\u2019s approach, see Maher (2004). The most\ncommon worry for Carnap\u2019s approach is that it renders the\nnormative import of the Indifference Principle too sensitive to the\nchoice of a language; for a reply, see J. Williamson (2010: chap. 9).\nFor more criticisms, see Kelly & Glymour (2004).\n\nThe Indifference Principle has been challenged for another reason.\nThis principle is often understood to dictate equal\nreal-valued credences in cases of ignorance, but there is the\nworry that sometimes we are too ignorant to be justified in having\nsharp, real-valued credences, as suggested by this case (Keynes 1921:\nch. 4):\n\n\n\n\nExample (Two Urns). Suppose that there are two\nurns, a and b. Urn a contains 10 balls. Exactly\nhalf of those are white; the other half, black. Urn b contains\n10 balls, each of which is either black or white, but we have no idea\nabout the white-to-black ratio. Those two urns are each shaken well. A\nball is to be drawn from each. What should our credences be in the\nfollowing propositions?\n\n (A) The ball from urn a is white.\n (B) The ball from urn b is white.\n \n\n\n\nBy the Principle of Indifference, the answers seems to be 0.5 and 0.5,\nrespectively. If so, there should be equal credences (namely 0.5) in\nA and in B. But this result sounds wrong to Keynes. He\nthinks that, compared with urn a, we have much less background\ninformation about urn b, and that this severe lack of\nbackground information should be reflected in the difference between\nthe doxastic attitudes toward propositions A and\nB\u2014a difference that the Principle of Indifference fails\nto make. If so, what is the difference? It is relatively\nuncontroversial that the credence in A should be 0.5, being the\nratio of the white balls in urn a (perhaps thanks to the\nPrincipal Principle). On the other hand, some Bayesians (Keynes 1921;\nJoyce 2005) argue that the credence in B does not have to be an\nindividual real number but, instead, is at least permitted to be\nunsharp, being the interval \\([0, 1]\\), which covers all the possible\nwhite-to-black ratios under consideration. This is only one motivation\nfor an interval account of unsharp credences; for another\nmotivation, see\n supplement A.\n\nIn reply to the Two Urns Case, objective Bayesians have defended one\nor another version of the Indifference Principle. White (2010) does it\nwhile maintaining that credences ought to be sharp. Weatherson (2007:\nsec. 4) defends a version that allows credences to be unsharp. Eva\n(2019) defends a version that governs comparative probabilities rather\nthan numerical credences. For more on this debate, see the survey by\nMahtani (2019) and the entry on\n imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe Principle of Indifference appears unhelpful when one has had\nsubstantive reason or evidence against some assignments of credences\n(making the principle inapplicable with a false if-clause). The\nstandard remedy appeals to a generalization of the Indifference\nPrinciple, called the Principle of Maximum Entropy (Jaynes\n1968); for more on this, see\n supplement D.\n\nThe above has only mentioned the versions of objective Bayesianism\nthat are more well-known in philosophy. There are other versions,\ndeveloped and discussed mostly by statisticians. For a survey, see\nKass & Wasserman (1996) and Berger (2006).\n",
