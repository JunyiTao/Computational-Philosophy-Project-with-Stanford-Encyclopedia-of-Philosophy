    "main_text": "A Different Kind of Challenge: Voluntarism\n8. Increasing Relevance and Significant Public Misperceptions\n\nThe literature on decision-making capacity has grown exponentially\nover the last decade, though interestingly most of the explosion is in\nthe clinical and research literature and has a decidedly empirical\nbent. Although new topics continue to be introduced, it is clear that\noutside philosophy much is assumed as settled that would not look\nsettled to a philosophical eye. Thus it will be interesting to see how\nthings develop over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, decision-making capacity is becoming more and more\nrelevant as certain types of ethical questions become hot topics of\npublic debate. For example, decisional-capacity is obviously of great\nimportance in relation to medical-assistance-in-dying laws\n (MAID),[4]\n and yet the public often fails to understand what is actually meant\nby decisional-capacity as well as how variable the practices of\nassessing capacity really are (Kim, Appelbaum, et al. 2011; Seyfried,\nRyan, & Kim 2013). This is particularly important since one of the\nmost divisive issues currently concerns whether those with mental\nillness or cognitive impairment should be candidates for assisted\ndying (Stewart, Peisah, & Draper 2011; Broome & de Cates 2015;\nPrice 2015; Schuklenk & van de Vathorst 2015; Appelbaum 2016;\nCharland, Lemmens, & Wada 2016; Doernberg, Peteet, & Kim 2016;\nKim & Lemmens 2016; Blikshavn, Husum, & Magelssen 2017). As\nthis entry makes clear, some of the most difficult questions about\ndecisional capacity arise specifically in the case of mental illness,\nmaking it even harder to determine whether MAID for the mentally ill\nis a policy that could be implemented appropriately, where\n\u201cappropriate\u201d here just means an implementation that\nstrikes just the right balance between protecting the truly\nvulnerable, on the one hand, and promoting freedom for those who can\nmeaningfully exercise it, on the other.\n",
