    "main_text": "\n\n\nImmigration occurs when someone moves to another country in order to\nstay indefinitely. Thus, because of the brevity of their visits,\ntourists, business travelers and foreign students, for example,\ntypically do not qualify as immigrants even though they spend time in\na foreign country. There are a variety of important issues\nsurrounding the morality of immigration, including difficult questions\nregarding the definition and moral status of refugees, the\ncircumstances (if any) in which it is permissible to use guest\nworkers, what obligations a rich country incurs when it actively\nrecruits skilled workers from a poor state, the rights of irregular\nmigrants, and whether there are any limitations on the selection\ncriteria a country may use in deciding among applicants for\nimmigration. This entry addresses each of these topics below, but\nfirst it reviews the most prominent arguments on both sides of the\ncentral debate in this area, whether states have the moral right to\nexclude potential immigrants.\n",
