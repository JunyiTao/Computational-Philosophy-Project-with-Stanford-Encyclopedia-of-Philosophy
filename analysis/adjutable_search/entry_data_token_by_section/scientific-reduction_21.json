Under\none interpretation, the expressions \u2018pain\u2019 and\n\u2018C-fiber stimulation\u2019 pick out abstract objects, namely\nnatural kinds, properties or types. On this reading of \u2018pain\nreduces to C-fiber stimulation\u2019, the primary relata of reduction\nshould be conceived of as properties or types. This view has played an\nimportant role in the philosophy of mind, underlying classical\nversions of type-identity theory and being the main target of\nanti-reductionist\u2019s counter-attacks (Putnam 1967; Fodor 1974,\n1997).\n4.5.1 Property-identity\n\nWhat sort of reductive link might suit those who assume that the\nprimary relata of reduction are properties? Doing justice to the idea\nthat if some a reduces to some b, then a\ndoes not exist over and above b, one might tend to assume\nthat property-reduction requires identity:\n\n\nIdentity reduction:\nP1 reduces to P2 only if\nP1 = P2.\n\n\nThis condition is, under a certain interpretation, what underlies\nNagelian bridge-principles (van Riel 2011, see however Sarkar 2015 for\na different interpretation). It is also explicitly endorsed by Robert\nCausey (1972a, b, 1977), who connects it to theory reduction via\nmicro-reductions. Just as in the writings of Smart (1959, 1963), the\nidea is that the relevant identities are not a priori. In addition, he\nsuggests that by identifying the relevant kinds, attributes and\nproperties of the reduced theory with kinds, attributes and properties\nof the reducing theory, we arrive at explanatory reduction because the\nlaws of the respective theories will thereby be shown to be\nnomologically equivalent (Causey 1974: 5).\n\nIdentity Reduction\n is, at the same time, obviously compatible with various sorts of\na-priorism. Moreover, it has been suggested that it offers a\npossible way to escape the explanatory gap: If some mental state just\nis some physical state, then there is nothing to be explained about\nhow \u201cthese states\u201d connect; it is a sheer misunderstanding\nto ask for more than just the identity-statement. Identity claims are\nbasic in the sense that they cannot be successfully explained in the\nrelevant sense (Block & Stalnaker 1999). As is well known, it is\noften hard to decide whether or not we are faced with identity or mere\ncorrelation; Wimsatt (1976: 697ff) argues that when we conceive of\nreduction as a scientific process, we are well advised to interpret\napparent correlations as identities.\n\nRecently, van Riel (2014) has argued that the idea that reduction is\nrelevantly tied to identity generates a puzzle: Intuitively, identity\nseemingly contradicts the directionality, or what is sometimes called\n\u2018asymmetry\u2019 of reduction. More precisely: if a\nreduces to b, then b does not reduce to a.\nBut how can this be if for a to reduce to b, it is\nrequired that a=b? The suggested solution is that\n\u2018_reduces to_\u2019 generates hyper-intensional contexts, and\nthat this is best explained by the idea mentioned above: For\na to reduce to b, two conditions must be satisfied:\n(i) a=b and (ii) \u2018a\u2019 expresses\na conceptual content that relevantly differs from the conceptual\ncontent expressed by \u2018b\u2019. Another option would\nconsist in giving this a pragmatist reading as in (Van Gulick 1992,\n2010), or giving up on the idea that identity is required for\n(property-)reduction.\n4.5.2 Alternatives to property-identity\n\nThere are three rival suggestions on the market, all of which argue\nthat weaker notions of reduction still serve the purpose of the\nreductivist: The reductive link could be spelled out in terms of\nsupervenience (Kim 1982, 1990), causation (En\u00e7 1976) and\nrealization (Kim 1998; Melnyk 2003; Shoemaker 2007. Whereas usual\nstipulations of supervenience do not rule out the possibility that\na supervenes on b and, at the same time, b\nsupervenes on a, at least causation seems to be relevantly\ndirectional and so do justice to the directionality of reduction.\nNevertheless, causation is probably not what is required: the\noccurrence of water is not caused by the occurrence of\nH2O (in the usual meaning of the term\n\u2018causation\u2019); there is no temporal component involved,\nwhat is, on most accounts, required by causation.\n4.5.3 Supervenience\n\nSupervenience does not fare better, though for different reasons: It\nseems to be too weak a notion to capture the idea that guided\nreduction-talk, although it surely is a necessary condition for\nreduction. In a sense, if mental states merely supervene on\nphysiological states, they exist in a straightforward sense over and\nabove the latter. Such supervenient states are dependent; but being\ndependent is not enough for reduction (Kim 1998). Note that this is,\nup to a certain point, a matter of stipulation. However, the\nstipulation is driven by an intuition: An appropriate definition of\nthe reduction-predicate should adequately mimic the intuitions that\nguided the use of the term. If, for example, one hope was to formulate\na strictly monist position, then relying on supervenience does not\nserve this goal: Supervenience makes room for a weak form of dualism.\nFor example, it is compatible with emergent property dualism. The\nemergent properties on such a view are something over and above the\nphysical, but in so far they emerge from the physical base according\nto natural laws of emergence, they would supervene on that base. Any\ntwo cases in which the physical bases were the same would also agree\nin their emergent properties. Thus supervenience is generally not\njudged sufficient for reduction. However, many regard it as consistent\nwith reduction or even required. With regard to the mind body case,\nfor example, Kim argues that supervenience is needed for what he calls\n\u201cminimal physicalism\u201d, whether reductive or not. Under a\nsomewhat liberal though well established interpretation of Nagelian\nreduction, there is a sense in which reduction is compatible even with\nemergence, that is: a theory about \u201cnovel behavior\u201d (and,\nthus, emergent behavior) can be deduced from another theory\n(Butterfield 2011a&b).\n4.5.4 Realization\n\nRealization, which has figured prominently in recent versions of\nnon-reductive physicalism may seem too weak a relation to support a\nreduction claim, but nonetheless strong enough to guarantee\nontological unity on the token level that underlies physicalism.\nRealization can be described in terms of dependence; e.g., for a\nparticular physiological event-type to realize pain is for it to be\nsuch that in virtue of its physiological organization, its instances\nplay the pain-role. This obviously suits the (role-) functionalist\ninterpretation of higher-level properties; these higher-level\nproperties are realized by lower level ones in the sense that\ninstances of the latter play the role of the former in virtue of their\nphysical organization.\n\nMost functionalists, being opposed to type-identity theory, regard the\nrealization-relation as too weak a relation for reduction. Given a\nstrong interpretation of what reductionism consists in\u2014e.g., the\ntype-identity of properties \u2013 the realization-interpretation\nmight not suffice to guarantee reduction. It might ensure reductionism\nat the token-level, but it might, at the same time, be committed to\ndualism at the property level\u2014though perhaps only a relatively\ninnocent form of dualism. Options to reconcile role-functionalism with\nreductionism have been introduced in\n Section 3.4.\n\n4.6 Wholes and their parts\n\nThe idea that reduction is tied to part-whole relations is frequently\nalluded to in the literature (esp. Schaffner 1993; Place 1956, 1960).\nThe most elaborate version of this assumption forms part of\nCausey\u2019s more general picture of scientific unification.\nIntuitively, and abstracting away from numerous details of his\nelaborate model (described in terms of theory-reduction), a\nmicro-reduction in Causey\u2019s sense relies on an identification of\na property P1 with a property\nP2, where the syntactical arrangement of the terms\nforming the complex term \u2018P2\u2019 reflect\nthe mereological composition of P1, whereas\n\u2018P1\u2019 does not.\n\u2018P1\u2019 simply refers to the whole\nwithout explicitly referring to its parts as\n\u2018P2\u2019 does, but they in fact refer to\nthe same complex. Whereas mereological relations alone are compatible\nwith emergentist or dualist interpretations combining mereological\ncomposition and identity seems to ensure a link strong enough to count\nas a reductive link.\n\nAnother way of connecting reduction to composition is this: one could\ntry to describe reduction as a one-many relation. In one use of the\nterm \u2018composes\u2019, a given object a may be composed\nout of several objects b1, b2,\nb3 \u2026 bn. At\nleast at the face of it, there is nothing in the use of\n\u2018reduction\u2019 that should prevent us from, say, stating that\na whole reduces to its parts.\n\nAt the same time, it is not clear how tying reduction to mereology\ncould deal with cases like this: Iron reduces Fe\n(the chemical structure kind). Both expressions, \u2018iron\u2019\nand \u2018Fe\u2019, are syntactically simple. More importantly,\n\u2018Fe\u2019 does not present us with Iron-atoms as\ncomposed wholes. Similarly, the often-used example of pain and C-fiber\nfiring does not match this idea.\n\nMoreover, this move would come at the price of building a sort of\natomistic materialism into the very notion of reduction; if we were to\ndefine reduction in mereological terms, it would be conceptually\nimpossible that parts reduce to the whole they form. However, it seems\npossible (though, in the light of science, maybe highly unlikely) that\nin some cases parts do not exist over and above the whole they form.\nSuch was the view of certain historical varieties of holistic idealism\n(see for example entry on\n F.H. Bradley),\n and some have argued it is true of quantum systems including\nentangled particles (Silberstein 1999). Thus if we were to tie the\nnotion of reduction to mereology, it would not be general enough to\ncapture the full range of possible reductionist positions.\n\nFinally, mereological relations are usually regarded as being\ninstantiated by concrete objects and the wholes they form. A\nderivative notion can be defined for properties via reference to\nmereological relations between their instances. However, it is not\nclear how this could extend to events or event-types. Thus\ninterpreting reduction as a matter of mereology might prevent us from\napplying it to events and deprive us of a fully general notion of\nreduction.\n4.7 Mechanisms\n\nOne solution to this problem would be to connect reductive explanation\nto mechanistic explanation, even though mechanistic explanation is\noften described by its proponents as non-reductivist in spirit\n(Kauffmann 1970; Cummins 1975, 1983, 2000; Bechtel & Richardson\n1993; Bechtel 1994; Glennan 1996; Machamer et al. 2000; Craver 2005,\n2007).\n\nThe proposal would be to define a phenomenon a as reductively\nexplained by a phenomenon b iff a is\nmechanistically explained by b. Mechanistic dependence might\nbe distinguished from a mereological relation, if mechanisms are not\nthe sorts of things that have parts in the ordinary sense of the term\nas some have claimed (Craver 2005). On one reading, the entity\nexplained in a mechanistic explanation is an event. A mechanistic\nexplanation explains an event in terms of events that together form\nthe event to be explained. On this view, mechanistic dependence is\nanalogous to mereological dependence but not the same, and might thus\ncomplement the mereological approach to yield a fully-fledged\ncharacterization of reduction.\n5. Unresolved issues\n\nThe mainstream in the philosophy of mind is, apparently, one version\nor another of non-reductive physicalism. The majority within the\nphilosophy of science has nowadays abandoned the unificationist\nprogram, to which reduction was intimately connected right from the\nstart. However, as became apparent only in recent years, some\nquestions regarding the concept of reduction have not successfully\nbeen accounted for yet, and recent developments in metaphysics in\nconnection with metaphysical grounding may shed new light on the\nconcept of reduction.\n5.1 Reduction and explanation\n\nPhilosophers do not agree upon the relation between reduction and\nexplanation. Some argue that the concept of reduction is on a par with\nconcepts such as causation in that it is intimately tied to certain\n\u2018because\u2019, \u2018in virtue of\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019\nstatements, or that there is no fundamental split between explanatory\nand ontological models of reduction (van Riel 2011; McCauley 1981).\nOthers have held that not only is there a difference between\nexplanatory reduction, which is an epistemological matter, and\nontological reductionism, but that there might even be a difference\nbetween explanatory reduction and derivation-based models of theory\nreduction (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology;\n see also Klein 2009; Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010).\n\nFor notions of reduction that are connected to explanation, the\ndifferent options are, apparently, these:\n\nThe notion of reduction is itself an explanatory concept,\nin the sense that it is a concept which is to be cashed out in terms\nof explanatory concepts: stating that a reduces to\nb, one states that b is explanatorily tied\nto a.\n The reduction relation is an explanatory relation,\ndespite the fact that the concept is not to be cashed out using\nexplanatory notions: that a reduces to b merely\nimplies that b is explanatorily tied to a.\n\n\nIf the concept of reduction is an explanatory concept, then a\ndefinition of it is either of the form [\u2026 because\n\u2026], or it relevantly involves an analysis of explanatory\nnotions. If it is not, but still is such that the relation is\nexplanatory, then a definition would at least imply the truth of a\ncorresponding explanation.\n\nGiven this broad outline, it seems reasonable to assume that most\nmodels of reduction are concerned with explanation in one of these\nsenses. Possible exceptions would include models that highlight\nreplacement issues, where an apparent phenomenon is not explained but\nrather \u201cexplained away\u201d, and perhaps some more technical\nnotions of reduction that are guided neither by intuitions of the\n\u201cnothing over and above\u201d sort, nor by any metaphysical\npositions such as functionalism (e.g., Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010;\nBickle 2008; Butterfield 2011a&b).\n5.2 Epistemological and ontological issues\n\nIn a similar spirit, notions of reduction are often characterized as\nbeing either ontological or epistemological. There\nis, again, no uniform use of these qualifications. For Oppenheim and\nPutnam (1958), epistemological reduction is a reduction that is\n\u201ctrue in virtue of the meanings of the terms involved\u201d\n(1958: 3), i.e., reduction that is tied to analysis in the spirit of\n A Priori Reduction-2;\n this use, however, is relatively rare. First of all, it will prove\nuseful to draw a distinction between epistemological and ontological\nforms of reductionism.\n5.2.1 Epistemological and ontological reductionism (and non-reductive physicalism)\n\nAn epistemological reductionist concerning a science or theory\nS holds that in fact, we are (or at some point will be) able\nto reduce S to a more fundamental science. It is a thesis\nabout what we can epistemically achieve. The ontological reductionist\nis, in this respect, more modest: She just holds that in fact, there\nis just one sort of objects and properties out there in the world;\nhowever, due to our cognitive limitations, we might never be able to\nactually carry out all the reductions that would be appropriate given\nthe actual ontological structure of our world (Scerri & McIntyre\n1997; Esfeld & Sachse 2010).\n\nThis distinction motivates different versions of non-reductive\nphysicalism. On one interpretation, the non-reductive physicalist\nopposes the idea that we can and should in fact reduce high-level\nsciences; we need them for epistemic or pragmatic purposes (Fodor\n1974, 1997; Putnam 1978; Van Gulick 1992). We need a plurality of\nautonomous theories and frameworks. However, the non-reductive\nphysicalist accepts that what is actually out there might very well be\nall of one kind, at least in some ultimate sense such that ontological\nreductionism is true.\n\nThis version of non-reductive physicalism has to be distinguished from\nan ontological version, which is best described as\ntoken-physicalism, or token-token identity theory.\nToken-physicalism is the view that what occurs in our world is just\nphysical; however, mental types are not identical to physical types.\nHence, in this form, non-reductive physicalism is compatible with a\nweak form of ontological pluralism at least of properties or\nkinds.\n\nIt is noteworthy that it is often rather difficult to draw the line\nbetween these two versions of non-reductive physicalism. This is\nmainly due to the fact that the notion of a type or a\nnatural kind is far from clear. Hempel, for example,\ntentatively suggests that what makes a type/kind a mental type/kind is\nthat it is referred to within psychology or psychological theories\n(Hempel 1969); thus the nature of a kind or type becomes dependent\nupon the context in which we refer to it, which in turn might be\nepistemically or pragmatically constrained. Fodor suggests that being\na kind is to be mentioned in a law; and that the locution \u2018it is\na law that\u2026\u2019 generates intensional contexts, i.e.,\ncontexts that are sensitive to how things are referred (Fodor 1974:\n109). Hence, being a kind again might not be an all-or-nothing affair.\nIf to be a kind is to play a certain epistemological role (this is, to\nbe sure, not Fodor\u2019s official point), then the distinction\nbetween ontological and epistemic versions of non-reductive\nphysicalism (and, analogously, between ontological and epistemological\nreductionism) might be hard to spell out.\n5.2.2 Epistemological and ontological reduction\n\nIndependent of issues regarding epistemic and ontological\nreductionism, philosophers sometimes allude to a distinction\nbetween epistemic and ontological forms of reduction. Sarkar\n(1992) suggests that a notion of reduction is epistemic if and only if\nit cashes out reduction in terms of explanation, presumably\nbased on the assumption that the concept of explanation is an\nepistemic concept. Thus insofar it enters the concept of reduction,\nthe latter is epistemic as well. On this view, an ontological concept\nof reduction would be one that is defined solely in non-epistemic\nterms.\n\nSilberstein (2002), Sarkar (1992), Brigandt and Love (2012), and\nHoyningen-Huene (1989) suggest another use of \u2018epistemic\nreduction\u2019: Reduction is epistemic if and only if its primary\nrelata are representational in nature (and, hence, this use is\nequivalent to Van Gulick\u2019s use of \u2018representational\nreduction\u2019 in 2001). Again this use seems motivated by the idea\nthat epistemic concepts enter this characterization of reduction; for\nexample, one might regard the very notion of a theory as an epistemic\nnotion insofar as a theory is a body of knowledge. Accordingly,\nontological reduction can be distinguished again in terms of the\nrelevant\nrelata: they must be non-representational entities.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this way of putting things is contentious and\npossibly misleading; after all, on a technical understanding theories\nare sets of sentences. The notion of a theory is thus a\n\u201clinguistic\u201d, rather than an epistemic notion. Labeling\ntheory-reduction as \u2018representational\u2019 rather than\n\u2018epistemic\u2019 leaves open the possibility that the concept\nof theory-reduction is independent of concepts such as knowledge,\nbelief, justification or understanding. At least Nagel\u2019s\nofficial definition does not make use of epistemic concepts.\n\nMoreover, this use of \u2018epistemic reduction\u2019 suggests a\nmisleading distinction. Any description of bridge-laws that involves\nreference to the predicates\u2019 extensions or intensions involves\nan \u201contological\u201d aspect. In this sense, the classical\naccounts of \u201cepistemological\u201d reduction are ontological,\nor at least include an ontological element.\n5.3 Reduction and Ground\n\nRecently, explanatory connectives, such as \u2018because\u2019 and\n\u2018in virtue of\u2019 have attracted considerable attention in\nthe study of metaphysical ground. Very briefly, the term\n\u2018ground\u2019 is used to articulate dependence claims, without\ncommitment to specific modal or counterfactual interpretations of\nvarious sorts of metaphysical dependence. Let us first provide some\nbackground and then hint at possible connections between reduction and\nground.\n5.3.1 A very short introduction to ground\n\nFollowing Schaffer (2009), one can draw a distinction between two\ntypes of metaphysics in terms of their alleged subject matter.\nQuinean metaphysics deals with existence questions. It asks:\nWhat exists? What is part of the ontology of a given theory, such as\nphysics? In contrast, (Neo-)Aristotelian metaphysics is\npermissive regarding existence. It is mainly concerned to identify\nwhat is fundamental and what depends on the fundamental. In\nSchaffer\u2019s terms, it is concerned with \u201cwhat grounds\nwhat\u201d (Schaffer 2009). Examples of dependence claims the\nNeo-Aristotelian is concerned with include:\n\nThe particularized property depends in its bearer.\nThe mental depends on the physical.\nAesthetic properties depend on physical properties and\nattitudes.\nMechanisms depend on their constituents and these\nconstituents\u2019 interactions. \nThe whole depends on its parts. \nSets depend on their elements.\nThe hole in the Swiss cheese depends on the cheese. \n\n\nAt least some of these claims, or cognates thereof, have formed part\nof metaphysics carried out in the Quinean spirit. Until recently,\nhowever, metaphysics did not provide the means to address these claims\nproperly, says the defender of ground. Consider the claim that the\nmental depends on the physical. Until recently,\nmetaphysicians would have suggested that this claim is to be cashed\nout in modal or counterfactual terms. The claim could be given an\ninterpretation in terms of supervenience: Any shift in mental\nproperties necessitates a shift at the level of physical properties.\n\n\nAny analysis along these lines will leave the grounding theorist\ndissatisfied. One reson to be skeptical about an analysis of\ndependence in terms of supervenience is that supervenience is neither\nirreflexive nor asymmetric (unless by way of\nstipulation). In contrast, the sort of dependence grounding theorists\nare after when claiming that the mental depends on the physical\nrequires that the physical does not depend on the mental, neither in\nwhole nor in part. Unlike supervenience, dependence, at least of the\nsort assumed in the grounding literature, is asymmetric and\nirreflexive. And dependence claims may concern necessarily\n(co-)existing entities; dependence, unlike supervenience, appears to\ngenerate hyper-intensional contexts, i.e. contexts in which even\nsubstitution of necessary equivalents is not guarantee to preserve\ntruth value (for further discussion, see Schaffer 2009, 364). \n\nThe concept of ground is supposed to do the trick. Ground is\nregarded as a primitive (Fine 2001). As a consequence, instead of\ngiving an analysis of the concept of ground, philosophers have studied\nthe structural features of ground \u2013 it is transitive,\nirreflexive, asymmetric, and it generates hyper-intensional contexts\n(Fine 2012; see also the contributions in Correia and Schnieder 2012).\nBut if this notion is primitive, how do we get access to it? After\nall, \u2018ground\u2019 is, like \u2018reduction\u2019, a\nphilosophical term; reflection on ordinary usage will not give access\nto its meaning in philosophical contexts.\n\nOne influential idea is that explanatory connectives such as\n\u2018because\u2019 or \u2018in virtue of\u2019 introduce a basic\nnotion of ground (Fine 2012). \u2018Because\u2019 and \u2018in\nvirtue of\u2019 are arguably asymmetric and irreflexive, and they\ngenerate hyper-intensional contexts (Schnieder 2011). They are part of\nordinary discourse, and we are competent in using these expressions.\nWhen taken in a non-causal sense, or in a context where these\nconnectives do not track causal dependencies, they may give access to\nthe sort of metaphysical dependence philosophers have sought to\ncapture for decades, if not centuries. \n\nAlternatively, one could give an ostensive definition and introduce\nthe notion of ground by way of examples; reflection on lists of\ndependence claims, or pairs of objects that are supposed to\ninstantiate the grounding relation, may give access to the notion of\nground (Schaffer 2009). \n\nThere are different interpretations of ground \u2013 in particular\nwith respect to what can bel labeled \u2018relational\u2019\ngrounding and \u2018operational\u2019 grounding (Tahko 2013).\nMoreover, philosophers who accept a relational interpretation disagree\nabout the primary relata of ground (candidates include:\nfacts, propositions, properties etc). \n\nSumming up: The primitive notion of ground is supposed to do justice\nto dependence claims, without any aspiration to further reduce this\nconcept to modal or counterfactual concepts; and it has been suggested\nthat explanatory connectives express this notion of ground. These\npreliminary remarks in mind, let us now turn to possible connections\nbetween redutcion and ground. First, there are two very general\nreasons to regard reduction as a particular variant of ground (5.3.2).\nAt the same time, there appears to be a tension between reduction and\nground. Either, reduction turns out to be distinct from ground, or the\nstructural features of reduction may shed light on the nature of\nground (5.2.3). Third, one may want to resist an assimilation of\nreduction to ground, based on a general skepticism towards the\nphilosophical significance of grounding talk (5.2.4). \n5.3.2 Reduction and ground linked\n\nThere are two paths leading from reduction to ground. First, reductive\ninterpretations of paradigmatic dependence claims may inspire a\nreconstruction of reduction in terms of ground. Reductionists about\nthe mental argue that mental states, like pain, reduce to certain\nphysiological states and are, hence, identical to the latter.\nEliminativists argue that mental states or properties just do not\nexist. Anti-reductionists maintain that pains exist and are different\nfrom corresponding physiological states. Some naturalists employ\nvarious notions of dependence to capture the priority of the natural\nwhile acknowledging a plurality of layers of reality. The debate thus\ncentered on questions of existence and, often, various\ndependence relations, ranging from emergence to ruthless\nreduction. It appears, then, that the reductionist about the mental\nmaintains that the mental reductively depends on the\nphysiological. \n\nBy these lights, it may seem plausible to reconstruct reduction claims\nin terms of ground (if we accept that grounding talk is fruitful).\nAbove, we have noted that the primitive concept of ground may be\nintroduced by way of examples, or by lists of paradigmatic dependence\nclaims. Theories of reduction may offer a viable interpretation of at\nleast some of these dependence claims. Hence, it should not come as a\nsurprise that some maintain that redution is sufficient for ground, so\nthat if a reduces to b, then b grounds\na (Rosen 2010, 124f., Schaffer 2009, 378, van Riel 2014). In\na similar spirit, one may suggest that grounding talk offers a\nfruitful reconstruction of the idea that some things do not exist\nover and above other things, an idea frequently invoked in the\nreductio debate (cf. Wilson 2014 for an extensive discussion). It\nseems that on this conception, reduction turns out to be a particular\nvariant of grund, perhaps among others.\n Second, conceptions of reduction in the philosophy of science,\nwhich draw on explanatory notions, are committed to the assumption\nthat there is a tight connection between reduction and ground,\nconditional on the assumption that explanatory vocabulary (interpreted\nnon-causally) does in fact introduce a notion of ground, as some\ngrounding theorists would have it. A concept of ground is often\nintroduced by reference to explanatory connectives, such as\n\u2018because\u2019, and \u2018in virtue of\u2019. On this\ninterpretation, there is a close link to conceptions of reduction in\nthe philosophy of science. Within this strand of the reduction debate,\nreduction has been conceived of as an explanatory connection (see\nabove). Of course, a robust metaphysical interpretation of explanatory\nlinks in terms of ground stands in stark contrast to some standard\nconceptions of explanation within the philosophy of science.  Realists\nhave mainly focused on causal explanation (Salmon 1989); only\nrecently, philosophers of science have turned to non-causal,\nmechanistic dependence (cf. Machamer et al. 2000, Craver 2005,\n2007). Others have taken explanation to be primarily an epistemic or\npragmatic affair (Kitcher 1989, Achinstein 1983, van Fraassen\n1980). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that it is an open question\nwhether (non-causal) explanation can be construed pragmatically or\nepistemically, or whether it requires a metaphysically robust\ninterpretation. If it turns out that explanation does require a\nmetaphysically robust interpretation, the fact that reduction has been\nconstrued as an explanatory notion in the philosophy of science may be\nseen as an indicator that claims of reduction are, properly construed,\nclaims of ground.\n5.3.3 A possible problem\n\nYet, there is a problem. Above, it has been pointed out that claims of\nreduction are often taken to imply corresponding identity claims.\nRecall Identity Reduction (4.5.1): \n\n\nIdentity reduction:\nP1 reduces to P2 only if\nP1 = P2.\n\n\nAs a consequence, reduction is taken to have the \u201cstructural\nfeatures of identity\u201d, such as reflexivity and symmetry, as\nTrogdon maintains (Trogdon 2013, similarly: Audi 2012), but also\nintensionality. Then, it is not clear how reduction could possibly\nexhibit the structural features of ground \u2013 irreflexivity,\nasymmetry, and hyper-intensionality. (This observation seems to\nparallel the tension between supervenience and dependence noted\nabove.) Philosophers have reacted in different ways. Some take these\nobservations at face value and conclude that reduction is distinct\nfrom ground (Audi 2012, Trogdon 2013). Others have argued that it\nwould be short-sighted to construe reduction in this way. From\nIdentity Reduction, it simply does not follow that reduction\nhas the structural features of identity. Recall the puzzle of\nreduction discussed above: Although reduction requires identity,\nidentity is not sufficient for reduction. In fact, if a\nreduces to b, it follows, by the asymmetry of reduction, that\nb does not reduce to a. For this and similary\nreasons, it has been suggested that reduction generates\nhyper-intensional contexts, and that reduction statements are\nsensitive to the modes of presentation expressed by the terms flanking\nthe reduction predicate (Jenkins 2011, van Riel 2013, 2014). On this\nview, reduction may turn out to be a variant of ground.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this debate turns on fundamental questions\nregarding the nature of ground. If reduction is a variant of ground,\nand if \u2018reduces to\u2019 generates hyper-intensional contexts\nin the way just sketched, then ground does not link\nnon-representational objects only. Put differently, the grounding\nstructure of the world would then depend, at least in part, on\nfeatures of representations of the world. Fine (2001, 2012)\nand DasGupta (2014) take ground to be concerned with truths or finely\nindividuated facts, rather than properties or fundamental or composed\nobjects. On the other hand, this observation has led some philosophers\nto assume that reduction, ontologically construed, should not be\nregarded as a version of metaphysical ground (Audi 2012). \n5.3.4 Reduction without grounding\n\nOf course, there may be very general reasons to reject grounding talk\naltogether (see the discussion in the entry Metaphysical Grounding).\nIn the present context, one criticism deserves close attention. Wilson\n(2014) maintains that reference to a primitive metaphysical relation\nin articulations of various dependence claims does not constitute\nphilosophical progress. Many of the various detailed explications of\ndifferent types of dependence, including mereological dependence,\nsupervenience, and the relation between determinables and\ndeterminates, promise illumination, whereas grounding talk is\nultimately obscure, mainly for two reasons. First,\n\u2018ground\u2019 is supposed to be primitive. Second, its\nstructural features of a partial order \u2013 ground is irreflexive,\nasymmetric and transitive \u2013 are too permissive and too narrow at\nthe same time, to single out a particular relation of metaphysical\ndependence, says Wilson. It is too permissive because temporal order\nand causation may have the same structural features (Wilson 2014,\n569). It may be too narrow because, for instance, mixed cases of\ndependence may violate transitivity (Schaffer 2012, Wilson 2014). So,\neven if there is prima facie evidence that reduction and ground are\nclosely linked, it is an open question whether shifting attention from\ntheories of reduction to the metaphysics of ground will prove\nfruitful. \n5.4 Problems for reductionism and the relevance of the notion of reduction\n\nScientific reduction became an important topic in the philosophy of\nscience within the context of a general interest in the unity of\nscience, and it was inspired by specific alleged cases of successful\nreductions. The most prominent argument against reductionism stems\nfrom the observation that straightforward reductions hardly ever\noccur. Hence, reductionism cannot be regarded as yielding a coherent\npicture of what actually goes on in science. As long as reductionism\nis supposed to be more than a purely metaphysical position and is\nintended to say something significant about scientific change or\nnorms, the value and relevance of the notion of reduction seems to\ndepend in part upon how well the reductionist positions fit the facts,\nwhich their critics argue they do not (see, for example, Sarkar 1992;\nScerri & McIntyre 1997).\n\nProponents of reduction have responded in different ways. Some have\nsuggested more flexible and liberal interpretations of reduction\n(Wimsatt 1976; Schaffner 1993; Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010), to ensure\nthat the term \u2018reduction\u2019 still serves a purpose in\ndescribing actual scientific practice. A case in point is\nSchaffner\u2019s suggestion (Schaffner 2006&2012) that we should\nreconsider the relevance of merely partial reductions or of scientific\nexplanations, broadly construed, that are reductionist in spirit,\ndespite the fact that they do not comply with more traditional\nstandards of full-fledged theory-reductions (see also Winther\n2009).\n\nOthers have opted for a more radical stance: Bickle has recently\nsuggested that philosophical theorizing about reduction should best be\nconstrued as reconstructing whatever cases scientists judge to be\nreductions (Bickle 2008).\n\nA much more modest position consists in the idea that, though\nstraightforward reductions might be rare, reductionism might play a\nrole as a regulative ideal (Schaffner 1993); the notion of reduction\ncan, on this view, be used to characterize one extreme of a spectrum\nof possible relations between different stages of scientific\ndevelopments. It comes with a specific normative power: If a reduction\ncan be effected, it should be effected.\n\nIn addition, the notion of reduction obviously plays an important role\nin the characterization of non-reductive physicalism; a careful\ninvestigation of what reductionism consists in is required to\nadequately determine in what respects, if any, a theory of mind could\nbe coherently both non-reductivist and materialist about the\nmental.\n\nFinally, the concept obviously plays an important role in the field of\nmetaphysics which often extends far into the realm of possibilities.\nEven if reductionism should fail to apply to our world and our\nscientific history, it might be of interest to consider what reality\nwould be like in other worlds where reductionism does hold, worlds\nsimilar to ours in containing many different theories or conceptual\nframeworks but ones tied together by reductive links.\n\nThe hope that the actual progress of science can be successfully\ndescribed in terms of reduction has vanished. Concepts of reduction,\nexcept for those re-adapted to actual scientific practice, are\nnowadays studied primarily in the more theoretically oriented parts of\nthe metaphysics of science.\n\nStill, the question of what the concept of reduction amounts to can be\nsatisfactorily answered even if no theory actually reduces to any\nother theory and no property reduces to any other property. Answering\nthis question may serve two closely related purposes. First, a precise\ncharacterization of what reduction is supposed to consist in will help\njudging whether or not a given theory, such as folk psychology, or a\ngiven property, such as being in pain, actually reduce to their neural\ncounterparts. Secondly, an appropriate definition of reduction is\ncalled for when it comes to evaluating anti-reductionist\npositions.\n\nAs we have seen, reduction has been conceived of as a relation that\nprimarily holds between theories, properties, substances, concepts, or\nevents. It has been described as an explanatory relation that can be\ncashed out in terms of derivation, and it could be tied to mechanistic\nor ontological dependence, supervenience and identity. It has been\nargued that theory-reduction is prior to ontological reduction; and it\nhas been argued that ontological reduction is more fundamental than\ntheory reduction. Reduction has been couched in structuralist,\nempiricist and functionalist frameworks, and it has been one of the\ncore notions of theories defending one form or another of scientific\nunification. Most philosophers have abandoned this latter view. But\neven if the outlook for strong general reductionism, a form of\nreductionism that amounts to scientific as well as ontological unity\nmight be dim, exploring the question of what it takes for a property\nor theory to reduce to another property or theory will help not only\nunderstand what the search for unity consists in, a search that\ndominated large parts of the philosophy of science in the last\ncentury; it will also help judging and understanding its rivals, such\nas non-reductive physicalism, versions of dualism, or even the\nrecently defended rainforest pluralism (Wimsatt 1994). If we know the\nconditions imposed by the reduction relation on pairs of theories or\nproperties, we will also know what these anti-reductionist theories\nare bound to deny.",
