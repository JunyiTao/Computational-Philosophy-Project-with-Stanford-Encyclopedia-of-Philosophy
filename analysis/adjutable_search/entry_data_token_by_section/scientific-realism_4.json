    "main_text": "Considerations in Favor of Scientific Realism (and Responses) || Corroboration\n2.2 Corroboration\n\nOne motivation for realism in connection with at least some\nunobservables comes by way of \u201ccorroboration\u201d. If an\nunobservable entity is putatively capable of being detected by means\nof a scientific instrument or experiment, this may well form the basis\nof a defeasible argument for realism concerning it. If, however, that\nsame entity is putatively capable of being detected by not just one,\nbut rather two or more different means of\ndetection\u2014forms of detection that are distinct with respect to\nthe apparatuses they employ and the causal mechanisms and processes\nthey are described as exploiting in the course of detection\u2014this\nmay serve as the basis of a significantly enhanced argument for\nrealism (cf. Eronen 2015). Hacking (1983: 201; see also Hacking 1985:\n146\u2013147) gives the example of dense bodies in red blood\nplatelets that can be detected using different forms of microscopy.\nDifferent techniques of detection, such as those employed in light\nmicroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, make use of very\ndifferent sorts of physical processes, and these operations are\ndescribed theoretically in terms of correspondingly different causal\nmechanisms. (For similar examples, see Salmon 1984: 217\u2013219 and\nFranklin 1986: 166\u2013168, 1990: 103\u2013115.)\n\nThe argument from corroboration thus runs as follows. The fact that\none and the same thing is apparently revealed by distinct modes of\ndetection suggests that it would be an extraordinary coincidence if\nthe supposed target of these revelations did not, in fact, exist. The\ngreater the extent to which detections can be corroborated by\ndifferent means, the stronger the argument for realism regarding their\nputative target. The argument here can be viewed as resting on an\nintuition similar to that underlying the miracle argument: realism\nbased on apparent detection may be only so compelling, but if\ndifferent, theoretically independent means of detection produce the\nsame result, suggesting the existence of one and the same\nunobservable, then realism provides a good explanation of the\nconsilient evidence, in contrast with the arguably miraculous state of\naffairs in which theoretically independent techniques produce the same\nresult in the absence of a shared target. The idea that techniques of\n(putative) detection are often constructed or calibrated precisely\nwith the intention of reproducing the outputs of others, however, may\nstand against the argument from corroboration. Additionally, van\nFraassen (1985: 297\u2013298) argues that scientific explanations of\nevidential consilience may be accepted without the explanations\nthemselves being understood as true, which once again raises questions\nabout the nature of scientific explanation.\n",
