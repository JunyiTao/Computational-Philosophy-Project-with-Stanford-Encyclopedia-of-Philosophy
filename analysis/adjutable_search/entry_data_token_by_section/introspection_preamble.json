    "main_text": "\n\nIntrospection, as the term is used in contemporary philosophy of mind,\nis a means of learning about one\u2019s own currently ongoing, or\nperhaps very recently past, mental states or processes. You can, of\ncourse, learn about your own mind in the same way you learn about\nothers\u2019 minds\u2014by reading psychology texts, by observing\nfacial expressions (in a mirror), by examining readouts of brain\nactivity, by noting patterns of past behavior\u2014but it\u2019s\ngenerally thought that you can also learn about your mind\nintrospectively, in a way that no one else can. But what\nexactly is introspection? No simple characterization is widely\naccepted.\n\nIntrospection is a key concept in epistemology, since introspective\nknowledge is often thought to be particularly secure, maybe even\nimmune to skeptical doubt. Introspective knowledge is also often held\nto be more immediate or direct than sensory knowledge. Both of these\nputative features of introspection have been cited in support of the\nidea that introspective knowledge can serve as a ground or foundation\nfor other sorts of knowledge.\n\nIntrospection is also central to philosophy of mind, both as a process\nworth study in its own right and as a court of appeal for other claims\nabout the mind. Philosophers of mind offer a variety of theories of\nthe nature of introspection; and philosophical claims about\nconsciousness, emotion, free will, personal identity, thought, belief,\nimagery, perception, and other mental phenomena are often thought to\nhave introspective consequences or to be susceptible to introspective\nverification. For similar reasons, empirical psychologists too have\ndiscussed the accuracy of introspective judgments and the role of\nintrospection in the science of the mind.\n",
