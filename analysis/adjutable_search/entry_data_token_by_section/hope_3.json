By\ncontrast, Christian philosophers such as Augustine and Thomas Aquinas\nanalyze hope as one of the most central virtues of a believer: Hope,\nprecisely in virtue of its capacity to justify action in a way which\nis not bound to knowledge, is a part of rational faith.\n\nEven in Saint Paul\u2019s argument for the extension of the Christian\ncommunity beyond the Jewish law, hope plays a central role. Paul\nstates that we can only hope for what is uncertain (Romans 8:24; see\nalso Augustine, City of God, book XIX, \u00a7IV, 1960: 139).\nNevertheless, such hope can be the product of the experience of\nsuffering, if this experience is seen through the lens of faith\n(Romans 5:3\u20135) and if the desire to be saved from this suffering\nis supported by confidence in not being disappointed. Instead of\nbackward-looking law-conformity (associated by Paul with the Jewish\nfaith), it is such forward-looking hope that characterizes the\nappropriate relation to God. As an illustration, Paul describes\nAbraham as \u201choping against hope\u201d (Romans 4:18),\nemphasizing the way in which hope goes beyond the evidence.\n\nAugustine of Hippo discusses hope systematically in his\nEnchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love (c. 420). Hope is\ndistinguished from faith\u2014which is also based on incomplete\nevidence\u2014by two features: First, hope is necessarily directed to\nfuture events, whereas faith can also relate to past events (such as\nChrist\u2019s resurrection). Second, hope only relates to what is\ngood for the hopeful person, whereas faith can also relate to what is\nbad (such as punishment for one\u2019s sins). Finally, hope, faith\nand love are seen as interconnected. Only if one loves the future\nfulfillment of God\u2019s will and thus hopes for it can one arrive\nat the correct form of faith (Enchiridion, II.7). As love\nprovides the normative outlook that underlies hope and faith (and\nthus, in some sense, the desire-component of hope), love is seen as a\nmore central virtue than hope (Enchiridion, XXX.114).\n\nThe hope for a life after death also plays an important role in\nAugustine\u2019s political philosophy. In the City of God,\nAugustine distinguishes the actual earthly city from the heavenly city\nthat only exists in the hope placed in God (City of God, book\nXV, \u00a7XXI, 1966: 541). The latter provides a reference point for a\nChristian view of politics. Hope, however, not only provides for a\nperspective on politics which surpasses the narrow perspective of\nclassical politics (Dodaro 2007), but an appropriate theorizing of\nhope also modifies the understanding of traditional political virtues,\nas it redirects their purpose from the earthly to the heavenly\ncity. One example of such a modification concerns punishment: Through\nhope, a Christian \u2018statesman\u2019 will redirect punishment\naway from an exclusive concern with proportionality towards the\npotential reform of the criminal (City of God, book V,\n\u00a7XXIV, 1963: 263).\n\nIn one of his letters to Macedonius, a public official, Augustine\nfinally emphasizes that the hope for a future life underlies all true\nhuman happiness, both on the level of the individual and of the state\n(Letter 155, Political Writings, \u00a74\u20138, pp.\n91\u201394). Thus, hope is not just of concern for individual\nbelievers but also for political leaders that are concerned with collective\nhappiness, as paying attention to hope allows them to pursue a\npolitical constitution that allows true virtue of citizens to emerge\n(see also Dodaro 2007).\n\nWhile Augustine is more or less exclusively concerned with the\nsignificance of hope for our pursuit of a good Christian life, Thomas\nAquinas\u2019 Summa Theologiae contains a systematic\ndiscussion of (ordinary) hope as a passion (ST I-II, q. 40) and as a\ntheological virtue (ST II-II, qq. 17\u201322). The former is directed to\nfinite, earthly goods, whereas hope as a theological virtue is\ndirected to ultimate happiness in the union with God. Even though the\ntwo kinds of hope are clearly distinct, Aquinas provides a unified\naccount of the formal features of their objects (I-II, q. 40, art.1)\n(see Bobier 2020a). The object of hope, he argues, is always thought\nto be good and future. Further, in contrast to mere desire, the\nobjects of hope must be difficult to obtain but nevertheless in the\nrealm of possibility (ST I-II 40.1). This rules out hope for that\nwhich is trivial to procure.\n\nRegarding the rationality of hope, Aquinas has a nuanced view. On the\none hand, he admits that a lack of experience can make one unaware of\nobstacles. This tendency (and drunkenness, ST I-II 40.6) can promote\n(irrational) hope. On the other hand, he assumes that hope can promote\nrational agency: As hope incorporates both knowledge of the possible\nand knowledge of the difficulties to reach the desired outcome, it can\nmotivate agents to devote energy to their activities.\n\nBecause of this ambivalence, hope in the ordinary sense is not a\nvirtue for Aquinas. As a passion, humans can display an excess and a\ndeficiency of hope (ST II-II 17.5); furthermore, passions are not\nvirtues by definition (Bobier 2018). This changes, however, as soon as\nwe examine theological hope, i.e., the hope we can put in God. First,\nas primarily directed towards God, such hope does not know any excess.\nSecond, we cannot understand theological hope as a passion. We must\nanalyze it as a habit of the will. While hope as a passion can only be\nincited by sensible goods (and subsequently motivates action insofar\nas the subject takes herself to be capable of realizing that good), we\ncan also hope for God\u2019s assistance (ST II-II 17.1) in reaching\neternal happiness (ST II-II 17.2). As eternal life and happiness are\nnot sensible goods, this kind of hope cannot be a passion but must\nreside in the will (ST II-II 18.1). Note, however, that Aquinas\ndescribes the theological virtues as habits of the will of a special\nsort: They cannot be acquired by habituation, but can only be given by\nGod\u2019s grace (ST II-II 17.1, see Pinsent 2020 for an\ninterpretation of hope as an \u201cinfused\u201d virtue).\n\nBecause of these two features, hope is a theological virtue (ST II-II\n17.5; see also 1 Corinthians 13). While love (or charity) is directed\nto God for the sake of unity, faith and hope are directed towards God\nwith a view to some good to be obtained from that unity: Faith relates\nto God as a source of knowledge, hope relates to God as a source of\ngoodness (ST II-II 17.6).\n\nThe rationality of theological hope can only be properly understood,\naccording to Aquinas, when we acknowledge that hope has to be preceded\nby faith (which underlies the belief in the possibility of salvation),\nbut, given faith, hope for the good of salvation is rational. In\ncontrast to most modern discussions of hope, Aquinas and other\nChristian authors therefore see hope as compatible with confidence or\neven certainty about the hoped-for outcome while still excluding\nknowledge (Jeffrey 2020: 44). Despair, as caused either by the absence\nof faith or the desire to be saved, is sinful (ST II-II 20.1). As hope\nis, by definition, future-directed, it is only possible for human\nbeings who are uncertain of whether they are blessed or damned,\nwhereas love can persist even after their ultimate fate has been\nrevealed (ST II-II 18.2\u20133).\n",
