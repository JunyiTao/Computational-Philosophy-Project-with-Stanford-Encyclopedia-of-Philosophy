    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was born on 20 May 1806 in Pentonville, then a\nnorthern suburb of London, to Harriet Barrow and James Mill. James\nMill, a Scotsman, had been educated at Edinburgh\nUniversity\u2014taught by, amongst others, Dugald Stewart\u2014and\nhad moved to London in 1802, where he was to become a friend and\nprominent ally of Jeremy Bentham and the Philosophical Radicals.\nJohn\u2019s remarkable education, famously recounted in his\nAutobiography, was conducted with the intention of equipping\nhim for leadership of the next generation of radicalism. For this, at\nleast, it prepared him well. Starting with Greek at age three and\nLatin at age eight, Mill had absorbed most of the classical canon by\nage twelve\u2014along with algebra, Euclid, and the major Scottish\nand English historians. In his early teenage years, he studied\npolitical economy, logic, and calculus, utilising his spare time to\ndigest treatises on experimental science as an amusement. At age\nfifteen\u2014upon returning from a year-long trip to France, a nation\nhe would eventually call home\u2014he started work on the major\ntreatises of philosophy, psychology and government. All this was\nconducted under the strict daily supervision of his father\u2014with\nyoung John holding primary responsibility for the education of his\nsiblings (Reeves 2007: 11\u201327).\n\nThe intensity of study and weight of expectation took its toll. Mill\nhad internalised the radical and utilitarian creed during his\neducation\u2014a process capped off with a close reading of Bentham\nin Dumont\u2019s French translation and editorial responsibility for\nBentham\u2019s Rationale of Judicial Evidence\u2014and had\nbegun to put it into practise as a youthful propagandist. But he\nquickly found that his education had not prepared him for life. Mill\nsuffered, aged twenty, a \u201cmental crisis\u201d.\n\n\n[I]t occurred to me to put the question directly to myself:\n\u201cSuppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all\nthe changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward\nto, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a\ngreat joy and happiness to you?\u201d And an irrepressible\nself-consciousness distinctly answered, \u201cNo!\u201d [\u2026] I\nseemed to have nothing left to live for. (Autobiography, I:\n139).\n\n\nMill\u2019s malaise continued through 1826\u20137 (Capaldi 2004:\n55ff.). Though such episodes were to recur throughout his life, his\ninitial recovery was found in the poetry of the Romantics. A new side\ndeveloped to Mill\u2019s character, and he now emphasised the\nimportance of the culture of the feelings as well as the need for\nsocial reform. Mill particularly valued Wordsworth during this\nperiod\u2014though his new interests quickly led him to the work of\nColeridge, Carlyle, and Goethe. Mill\u2019s acquaintance with these\nthinkers gave him a lasting openness to Romantic thought\u2014and an\nacute awareness that the Enlightenment philosophy with which he had\nbeen brought up only contained \u201cone side of the truth\u201d\n(Autobiography, I: 169). His primary philosophic goal became,\nand would throughout his life remain, to integrate and reconcile these\nopposing schools of philosophy. \u201c[W]hoever could master the\npremises and combine the methods of both, would possess the entire\nEnglish philosophy of their age\u201d (Coleridge, X:\n121).\n\nThis new-found eclecticism also led to productive engagement with,\namongst others, Francois Guizot, Auguste Comte, and Tocqueville. All\nwould leave a lasting influence on Mill\u2019s work, but in this\nperiod, another figure also loomed large: Harriet Taylor (Kinzer 2007:\n77\u2013111). Mill met Harriet at a dinner party in 1830, and the two\nquickly fell in love. Harriet had, four years\u2019 prior, married\nJohn Taylor\u2014an amiable, though intellectually unadventurous,\npharmacist. The three eventually came to an arrangement by which Mill\nwould be allowed to visit Harriet at the Taylors\u2019 country\nretreat when her husband was not present, and at their London\nresidence while he visited his Club. This arrangement persisted for\nyears, and, by all accounts, Mill and Harriet\u2019s relationship was\nentirely platonic. John Taylor died in 1849, with Harriet and Mill\nmarrying in 1851\u2014though not before the perceived scandal had\ncaused a rift between Mill and many of his friends. Mill felt\nfirst-hand the stifling effect of Victorian judgmentalism and\noppressive norms of propriety\u2014a subject he would later take up\nin On Liberty.\n\nMill idolized Harriet, and credited her with virtual co-authorship of\nmany of his works. Untangling the influence she exerted upon\nMill\u2019s thought is complicated, precisely because the two worked\nso closely together on what would become many of Mill\u2019s central\nideas. She died, however, in 1858, while Mill and she were travelling\nthrough France. Harriet was buried in Avignon, where Mill subsequently\npurchased a house close by the cemetery, and lived for the rest of his\nlife. Mill inscribed on her grave that \n\n\n[s]he was the sole earthly delight of those who had the happiness to\nbelong to her. [\u2026] Were there but a few hearts and intellects\nlike hers this earth would already become the hoped-for heaven.\n\n\nHarriet\u2019s death, in fact, came only a little over a month after\nMill\u2019s retirement from the East India Company, for which he had\nworked for almost thirty-five years. Mill had taken a position as a\njunior clerk at aged seventeen, working directly under his father, who\nhad received the post on the basis of his authorship of A History\nof British India. John rose through the ranks, eventually holding\nthe position of Chief Examiner of Correspondence\u2014a position\nroughly equivalent to Undersecretary of State, involving managing\ndispatches for colonial administration (Zastoupil 1994). The job, Mill\nnoted, provided the stability of income needed for an author without\nindependent means, and was not so taxing as to prevent him exerting\nthe majority of his time and mental energy on his philosophical\npursuits. In 1865, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for\nWestminster for the Liberal Party. In keeping with his views on\ndistinction between representation and delegation, Mill declined to\nactively canvass for the seat\u2014indeed, he remained, for most of\nthe campaign, at his home in Avignon. While in the Commons, he\nchampioned what he perceived as unpopular but important causes: the\nextension of suffrage to women, Irish reform, and the prosecution of\nGovernor Eyre for atrocities committed during his administration of\nJamaica. He did not win a second term, being defeated by in 1868\n(Kinzer, Robson, and Robson 1992).\n\nMill, it might be noted, never held a university post\u2014nor did he\neven attend university himself\u2014except for the\n\u201chonorary\u201d position of Rector of the University of St\nAndrews. He was, throughout his life, a religious sceptic, having been\n\u201cbrought up from the first without any religious belief\u201d\n(Autobiography, I: 41; see also Matz 2017). He died in\nAvignon on 7 May 1873, and was buried next to his wife.\n",
