    "main_text": "Logical Empiricism and Scientific Realism\n3. Logical Empiricism and Scientific Realism\n\nIt is commonly supposed that logical empiricism and scientific realism\nare systematically at odds. However, Feigl\u2019s diverse\ncontributions to the scientific realism debate just suggest the\nopposite: Influenced by the early \u2018critical\u2019 realism of\nhis teacher Schlick, Feigl (like Reichenbach and Eino Kaila) argued in\nterms of a reconciliation of both positions, that is, he attempted to\ncombine logical empiricist methods with a scientific realist account\nof theoretically postulated entities (see, in this connection, also\nNeuber 2012, esp. pp. 45\u201351, and especially Neuber 2018b, ch.\n5).\n\nTo begin with, in their 1931 article \u201cLogical Positivism: A New\nMovement in European Philosophy,\u201d Feigl and Blumberg presented\nthe logical positivist approach as the synthesis of two\n\u201csignificant traditions\u201d (Feigl/Blumberg 1931, p. 281):\nthe classical \u201cpositivistic-empirical\u201d current in European\nphilosophy, and the development of modern (mathematical) logic. The\nmost characteristic feature of the emerging \u201cnew movement\u201d\nwas, according to Feigl and Blumberg, its conception of the\npropositions of metaphysics as \u201cmeaningless\u201d (ibid., p.\n282). This diagnosis also pertained to Kant\u2019s account of\nsynthetic a priori judgments, the existence of which was\nexplicitly contested. However, it must be seen that Feigl never went\nas far as to reject the analytic/synthetic distinction as such. As he\nlater argued against Quine, \u201c[t]he revolt against the dualism of\nthe analytic and the synthetic rests on a confusion of the logical\nanalysis of (artificially fixed) languages with the historical\ninvestigation of (growing, shifting natural) languages\u201d (Feigl\n1956, p. 7\u20138). Thus, in the logical positivist account, analytic\npropositions had to be sharply distinguished from synthetic\npropositions. Whereas the latter had their place in experience and\nexperiential science, the former belonged to logic and mathematics.\nMore precisely, Feigl and Blumberg agreed with Wittgenstein that\nlogic, by its very nature, is purely tautological. It has nothing to\ndo with experience, but only with the internal structure of language.\nHere, they saw the principle advantage over previous, traditional,\nempiricist accounts of logic and mathematics. Moreover, Feigl and\nBlumberg maintained that even the concepts of the empirical sciences\nare such as can be subject to a purely formal, logical,\nreconstruction. Relying on a principled distinction between\n\u201cknowledge proper\u201d (Erkenntnis) and objectivity,\non the one hand, and \u201cimmediate experience\u201d\n(Erlebnis) and subjectivity, on the other, they referred the\nreader to Carnap\u2019s Der logische Aufbau der Welt,\nthereby implying that a constitution of empirical concepts from a\nsingle primitive relation, namely that of\n\u201c\u00c4hnlichkeitserinnerung\u201d, by \u201cpurely\nlogical operations\u201d (Feigl/Blumberg 1931, p. 286) was at least\nin sight. The essential point in this connection was that the\npropositions of empirical science were supposed to be translatable\ninto a series of propositions which exclusively referred to structural\nfeatures of experience, but not to the experientially given itself\n(which was conceived of as completely subjective and thus\n\u2018private\u2019). It was therefore structure which stood in the\nfocus of the respective reconstruction of empirical knowledge.\nKnowledge, according to Feigl and Blumberg, is to be defined as\n\u201cthe communicable\u201d (ibid.) and \u201c[w]hat knowledge\ncommunicates is structure [\u2026].\u201d (ibid.)\n\nIt was just a few years later that Feigl\u2014rather\nsignificantly\u2014modified his point of view. Or, as he himself\nreports:\n\nHaving stereotyped myself (in the notorious fanfare article written in\ncollaboration with A. E. Blumberg [\u2026]), as a \u2018logical\npositivist,\u2019 the label has stuck to me ever since. As early as\n1935, however, I abandoned the label [\u2026] and availed myself of\nthe alias \u2018logical empiricist.\u2019 This was triggered by a\nremark of a French philosopher at the International Congress for the\nUnity of Science in Paris (1935). He burst out at me: \u2018Les\npositivists, ce sont des idiots!\u2019 (Feigl 1981, p. 38)\n\n\nThe programmatic impact of the distinction drawn here by Feigl between\n\u2018logical positivism\u2019 and \u2018logical empiricism\u2019\nmight be doubted (see Uebel 2013). However, in order to adequately\nunderstand the line of Feigl\u2019s philosophical development, the\ndistinction is quite apt. Thus, in the first instance, it was the\nliberalization of the logical positivist criterion of meaning which\ncaused a shift in Feigl\u2019s general philosophical outlook.\nAccording to the early, logical positivist, conceptions of language\nand science, the meaning of a proposition must be anchored in\nobservable facts. More precisely, the meaning of a given proposition\nis entirely exhausted by its verification on a purely observational\nbasis. Yet it turned out, as a major consequence of the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s protocol-sentence debate (see Uebel 2007), that this\ncriterion was far too strict. Direct verifiability was (by Carnap,\nHempel, and others) substituted through weaker criteria such as (at\nleast indirect) testability (see Carnap 1936/37) or confirmability and\ndisconfirmability (see Hempel 1935; 1945; 1950a). Nevertheless, the\nlogical positivists\u2019 rejection of metaphysics remained\nquintessentially intact. As Feigl points out in a paper titled\n\u201cScientific Method without Metaphysical Presuppositions\u201d\n(1954), there are two senses in which the term\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019 appears objectionable also from the\nliberalized, logical empiricist, perspective; namely a) the assertion\nof transcendent, i.e., in principle untestable statements, and b) the\nbelief in factual truths that could be validated a priori, i.e., in\ncomplete independence of the data of observation. In both cases, the\nrealm of the meaningful is distinguished from these two objectionable\nregions.\n\nAnother, systematically more far-reaching aspect of Feigl\u2019s\n(self-ascribed) shift from logical positivism to logical empiricism\nwas his increasingly explicit embrace of a \u2018realist\u2019\napproach to science and scientific theory construction. In\nFeigl\u2019s own words: \u201cPerhaps the most important and\nconstructive aspect in the transition to Logical Empiricism was the\nelement of empirical or scientific realism that became increasingly\nprominent in our views. Reichenbach and I had already opposed the\nphenomenalistic reduction during the twenties. In this regard we were\ncloser to the views of Zilsel and Popper. We regretted that Schlick\nhad abandoned his early critical realism, and we tried to reinstate it\nin a more defensible form.\u201d (Feigl 1981, p. 80) At another\nplace, Feigl indicates:\u00a0\u201cMy own emancipation began in the\nmiddle thirties and was stabilized in the forties. Studies and\nteaching in the field of the philosophy of science helped me regain,\nrefine, and buttress my earlier realistic position. I was also greatly\nencouraged by the scientific realism of Hans Reichenbach and the\nrealistic epistemologies of my steadfast dear friends Roy W. Sellars\nand Wilfrid Sellars.\u201d (Feigl1981, p. 39)\n\nIt was as early as 1935 that Feigl, at the above quoted International\nCongress for the Unity of Science in Paris, gave a talk on\n\u201cSense and Nonsense in Scientific Realism\u201d (see Feigl\n1936; further Neuber 2011, p. 169). In 1943, then, he published a\npaper titled \u201cLogical Empiricism.\u201d There, he argued that\nthe term \u2018real\u2019 is employed with good reason (both in\ndaily life and in science) to designate \u201cthat which is located\nin space-time and which is a link in the chains of causal\nrelations\u201d (Feigl 1949, p. 16). In this sense, the reality of\natoms (and other theoretically postulated entities) is equally capable\nof empirical test as the reality of rocks and trees. Accordingly,\nreality should be ascribed to whatever is confirmed as having a place\nin the spatiotemporal-causal system. After all,\nthis\u2014realistically inspired\u2014point of view directly emerged\nfrom the liberalization of the logical empiricists\u2019 criterion of\nmeaning. It was indeed the result of the insight that \u201cmost of\nour knowledge, and especially almost all of the more interesting and\nimportant part of it, is highly indirect. It is shot through with\ninterpretation, construction, and inference, and consequently is\ndependent on very general assumptions\u201d (ibid., p. 14).\n\nHowever, Feigl\u2019s mature conception of a synthesis of scientific\nrealism and logical empiricism is to be found in his 1950 article\n\u201cExistential Hypotheses\u201d (published in Philosophy of\nScience). There, it was semantics which served as the\nvehicle for Feigl\u2019s promotion of the realist project. By\n\u2018semantics,\u2019 Feigl meant (in a nutshell) the formal\nscrutiny of reference and truth (see Feigl 1950a, p. 36). As such, it\nhad nothing to do with the concrete methods of testing hypotheses.\nRather, \u201csemantic realism,\u201d as Feigl pointed out at\nanother place, \u201cis concerned only with the most abstract and\nformal features of the semiotic situation\u201d (1950b, p. 192). This\nimplied, in particular, that a) reference must be sharply\ndistinguished from evidence, and that b) truth must be sharply\ndistinguished from verification. It was on this basis that Feigl saw\nhimself in a position to avoid \u201cthe reductive fallacies of\nphenomenalism\u201d (1950a, p. 35). By the \u201creductive fallacies\nof phenomenalism,\u201d he meant the logical constructionist accounts\nof Bertrand Russell (1914) and the early Carnap (1928). In\nRussell\u2019s and Carnap\u2019s view, the theoretical statements of\nthe empirical sciences were, at least according to Feigl,\n\u201cconsidered as translatable into statements concerning the data\nof direct experience\u201d (1950a, p. 35). This conception was, in\nFeigl\u2019s eyes, \u201cfallacious\u201d because the assumption of\ncomplete translatability was, he thought, semantically misguided.\nTheoretical sentences should be invested with what Feigl called their\n(so to say \u2018untranslatable\u2019) \u201csurplus\nmeaning.\u201d This surplus meaning he considered to consist in the\n\u201cfactual reference\u201d of theoretical terms (ibid., p. 48).\nMore concretely, Feigl was convinced that terms like\n\u2018atom,\u2019 \u2018force,\u2019 or \u2018electromagnetic\nfield\u2019 cannot be reduced to purely observational terms\ndescribing our direct experiences. Rather, theoretical terms were\nsupposed to refer to unobservable, mind-independent entities, so that,\nfor example, the referent of the term \u2018atom\u2019 would be real\natoms and not samples of \u2018logical constructions\u2019 out of\nsense data (or other kinds of directly perceivable things). Therefore,\nFeigl urged that \u201cwe must distinguish between the radical\nempiricist\u2019s meaning of \u2018meaning\u2019 (i.e., epistemic\nreduction) and another, more common-sensical meaning of\n\u2018meaning\u2019 (factual reference)\u201d (ibid., p. 49).\n\nIt has (very aptly) been remarked that Feigl\u2019s \u201csemantic\nrealism is an anti-reductive position\u201d (Psillos 1999, p. 12). It\nis anti-reductive insofar as the theoretical language of science is\nclaimed to be autonomous in relation to the observational evidence\nbase. Consequently, the mind-independence of the \u2018factual\nreferents\u2019 of theoretical terms seems to be secured by the very\nreference relation itself: the existence of theoretical entities like\natoms is obviously implied by the independent reference of theoretical\nterms like \u2018atom.\u2019\n\nMoreover, Feigl\u2019s account of factual reference is intimately\nlinked with the concept of truth. In general, the meaning of a\nsentence consists, according to the theory proposed by Feigl, in its\ntruth conditions (see Feigl 1950b, p. 191 and Feigl 1981, p. 43).\nThese truth conditions, in turn, are treated compositionally: they\nobtain when the entities to which we refer stand in the relations to\nwhich we refer, that is, independently of the conditions of the\ncorresponding scenario of verification. Accordingly, relations between\nthe \u2018factual referents\u2019 of theoretical terms serve as\n\u2018truth makers\u2019 for theoretical statements. Feigl therefore\nconcludes that by adopting a \u201csemantic metalanguage\u201d (as\nhe could find it in the works of Tarski and the later Carnap) we are\nin a position to employ \u201ca conceptual model in which statements\nas well as the states of affairs that render these statements true,\ncan be represented\u201d (Feigl 1950a, p. 49).\n\nStill, there is an important qualification in Feigl\u2019s account of\nrealism. This qualification has to do with the fact that Feigl takes\npains to separate his own semantic-scientific realism from traditional\nmetaphysical realism. By metaphysical realism, Feigl means all\nattempts to systematically employ \u201ctranscendent, i.e., in\nprinciple untestable, assertions\u201d (Feigl 1956, p. 22). By his\nown account, however, the testability or confirmability of an\nassertion is the crucial criterion for its being meaningful. Feigl\nwrites:\n\nNo concrete existential hypothesis of ordinary life or of science is\nfactually meaningful unless it is confirmable. The essential\nrequirement of empiricism is thus safeguarded. But the very adoption\nof the confirmability criterion (in preference to the\nnarrower verifiability criterion) allows as much realism as\nwe are ever likely to warrant. (1950a, pp. 50\u201351)\n\n\nAnd at another place, he comments:\n\nSemantic realism as I should like to see it understood, is free from\nthe dangers of metaphysics precisely because it does not\nprescribe anything at all about the nature of the\ndesignata of our theoretical constructs. [\u2026] Things are and\nwill always be\u2014as far as we can meaningfully talk about\nthem\u2014what they are confirmably knowable as; and it is\nup to the advance of science, not to logical and semiotic analysis, to\ntell us what things are \u201creally\u201d like. But it is the task\nof logical analysis to tell us by means of what rules of our language\nwe describe the objects of our knowledge, and [\u2026] what we mean\nby the surplus of the knowable over the known.\n(1950b, p. 192)\n\n\nIt should be noted that this passage is quoted from Feigl\u2019s\nreply to criticisms brought forward by his logical empiricist\ncolleagues Philipp Frank, Carl Gustav Hempel, and Ernest Nagel (the\ncontext being a symposium on Feigl\u2019s \u201cExistential\nHypotheses\u201d). Hempel, for instance, had argued that the notion\nof the reference of theoretical terms is \u201cunnecessary\u201d\nbecause it \u201ccan be eliminated, by means of Feigl\u2019s own\ncriterion of factual reference\u201d (Hempel 1950b, p. 173), namely\nthe systematic interconnections between theoretical statements on the\none hand and observations sentences on the other. In a similar vein,\nFrank had objected that \u201cafter the introduction of the truth\nconditions a statement in the language of \u2018semantical\nrealism\u2019 can no longer be distinguished from a statement in the\nlanguage of \u2018syntactical positivism\u2019\u201d (Frank 1950,\np. 167). Quite the same was brought forward by Nagel who argued that\nby heavily relying on confirmability Feigl completely remains within\nthe \u2018received\u2019 logical positivist agenda, so that his talk\nof \u2018realism\u2019 should be regarded as devoid of any\ndistinctive character. According to Nagel, \u201cFeigl is pressing\nfor a distinction without a difference\u201d (Nagel 1950, p.\n179).\n\nIn order to counter these objections one would have to show how\nsemantics (i.e., Feigl\u2019s theory of reference and truth) and\nepistemology (i.e., Feigl\u2019s insistence on confirmability) are\nrelated to each other. There is some evidence that Feigl\u2019s\nadoption of Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s idea of a \u2018pure\npragmatics\u2019 (see Feigl 1950a, pp. 49\u201350; 1981, pp.\n254\u2013255) could play the essential role in this connection.\nHowever, Sellars\u2019s conception of a \u2018pure pragmatics\u2019\nis itself rather \u201ceccentric\u201d (Carus 2004, p. 320) and it\nis fairly hard to see how, according to Feigl, a realist approach to\nscience could be defended on the basis of an essentially pragmatic\njustification (for further details, see Neuber 2011, pp.\n175\u2013176, and especially Neuber 2017)\n",
