    "main_text": "The Nature of Envy || \u2018Benign\u2019 and \u2018Invidious\u2019 Envy\n1.3 \u2018Benign\u2019 and \u2018Invidious\u2019 Envy\n\nMany authors posit a distinction between two kinds of envy: a\nmalicious or invidious form, and a benign, emulative, or admiring\nvariety of\n envy.[3]\n Typically, the point of the distinction is to identify a class of\ncases in which envy is somehow permissible or justifiable and separate\nthem from cases in which it is not. While details differ, the general\nidea is that invidious envy involves a desire that the rival lose the\ngood, whereas benign envy does\n not.[4]\n But other philosophers claim that benign envy is not envy at\n all.[5]\n Like many disagreements over the nature of emotions, this one\nthreatens to become a merely verbal dispute, but it can be understood\nas a substantive question about the character of an empirical\n phenomenon.[6]\n\nSome of the examples advanced on behalf of the suggested bifurcation\nthreaten to obscure the issue. It will not do, for instance, simply to\npoint out that people commonly say that they envy someone\u2019s skill in\ncases where it is quite implausible to suppose that they have any\ndesire that the person loses the skill. There is undoubtedly a common\ntendency to use the term \u2018envy\u2019 for any desire for\nsomething that is possessed by another. But, given the looseness of\nnatural language noted above, we must not simply assume that these are\nreally cases of the emotional syndrome of envy. Although some\ndiscussions of envy seem to treat any desire for [an instance of] what\nanother person has as envy, this threatens to assimilate some cases of\nenvy to\n admiration.[7]\n\nMost parties to the debate would grant that not every case in which\nsomeone would like something that someone else possesses is a case of\ngenuine envy. First, envy is typically agreed to be a form of pain or\ndistress\u2014an unpleasant emotion. To fancy someone else\u2019s linens\nis not yet to envy them. So not every such desire should be counted as\na case of benign envy. Furthermore, even a painful desire for what\nsomeone else possesses might be better described as longing than envy.\nIf you badly (painfully) want the new Mercedes convertible, then you\nlong for it. If you then discover that your neighbor has bought one,\ndoes your longing become envy? To avoid turning this into a matter of\nstipulation or a verbal dispute, it should be a substantive\npsychological question whether you envy her for it. Envy should not be\nheld to follow as a logical consequence of the conjunction of your\npainful desire with the belief that she has (an instance of) its\nobject. But then there must be something more to envy than painfully\nwanting something that (you know) someone else has.\n\nRobert Young suggests that what differentiates envy from mere longing\nis that, in (even benign) envy, the subject is pained because the\nrival has the good. But it is questionable whether this proposal\nsucceeds as a defense of benign envy. If the \u201cbecause\u201d in question is\ncausal-explanatory, this seems insufficient to mark the relevant\ndistinction. After all, ordinary longing may be occasioned by seeing\nthe good in someone else\u2019s possession. Perhaps if your neighbor hadn\u2019t\nacquired the convertible, it would never have come to your attention.\nIt would then be true that you want it because she has it, yet it\nseems possible that this is longing, not envy. Suppose that you would\nhave been equally pained by not having it regardless of how you\ndiscovered its existence. Then the fact that, as it happens, your longing\nwas caused by seeing it in the neighbor\u2019s driveway does not\nsuffice to make this a case of envy.\n But perhaps Young\u2019s \u201cbecause\u201d offers something like\nthe agent\u2019s reason for being pained, or the content of a thought at\nwhich she is pained. In other words, perhaps the point is to emphasize\nthe idea that the subject really is bothered specifically by the\ndifference in possession, not just by his own lack of the good. But if\nso, more would need to be said to explain how how the envy can be\nbenign. If what pains the subject, or what he evaluates as bad, is\nreally the disparity between the subject and the rival (not just the\nsubject\u2019s lack), it is hard to see how the subject could lack any\ndesire for the rival to lose the comparative advantage. After all, by\nhypothesis the situation in which the rival loses the good without the\nsubject getting it would be better than the status quo, as far as the\nsubject\u2019s envy is concerned \u2013 inasmuch as there would then be no\ndisparity to be bothered by. Of course the subject may not prefer all\nthings considered that the rival lose the good. But if he is only\nmotivated to improve his position, and lacks any desire for the rival\nto lose the good, then why think that what bothers him is really the\ndisparity, rather than just his own lack? \n\nSara Protasi (2016) offers a more complex taxonomy of envy which\nincludes a version of benign envy that she calls \u201cemulative\nenvy.\u201d She draws two cross-cutting distinctions: whether the\nsubject is focused upon the good or upon the rival, and whether she\nperceives the good as obtainable or unobtainable. Focus is understood\nnot in terms of salience or conscious attention, but as a matter of\nevaluative concern: \u201cwhat the envier focuses on is whatever she\ncares about, from a prudential point of view.\u201d (2016, p. 4) In\nemulative envy, the envier is focused on the good and believes himself\ncapable of obtaining it. She is motivated to improve her standing, not\nto bring down the rival. But emulative envy is supposed to be distinct\nfrom admiration or even longing. It is meant to be a species of envy\nin general, which Protasi defines as \u201can aversive reaction to a\nperceived inferiority to a similar other, with regard to a good that\nis relevant to the sense of identity of the envier.\u201d (2016, p.2)\nA question for this account is what role the perceived inferiority to\nthe rival can be playing in emulative envy, if the envier is held to\ncare only about the good, and not the inferiority as such. If it is\nplaying no role, then why think this is a species of envy in general,\nrather than a (no doubt common and important) emotion of some other\nsort? But if it is allowed that emulative envy does also include a\nconcern about inferiority as such, distinct from the desire for the\ngood, then the question is how to make that concern compatible with an\ninsistence that there is no desire that the rival lose the good. \n\nEven those who deny that \u201cbenign envy\u201d is a kind of envy\n(hereafter, \u201cdeniers\u201d) will grant the existence of cases\nin which people want to have skills or other traits that are possessed\nby another person, and are pained by their lack, but in which they\nhave no desire at all for the other person to lose those traits. Call\nsuch a state \u201cemulative desire.\u201d Apparently some\nother languages have a word for that\n state.[8]\n What deniers deny is that emulative desire is an instance of envy (or\nof \u201cenvy proper\u201d, as Rawls puts it). But what is at stake\nin such a claim? We have already noted that ordinary usage surely\npermits application of \u201cenvy\u201d in such cases, and in others\nbesides, so linguistic propriety is not the issue. One way of\nunderstanding the debate concerns which taxonomy of mental states\ncarves emotions at their joints\u2014that is, carves them in ways\nthat reflect psychological kinds that support predictions and\nexplanatory generalizations. \n\nOne way to develop the deniers\u2019 position is as\n follows.[9]\n Envy is a distinctive kind of psychological state that is essentially\ncompetitive. It is concerned specifically with unfavorable comparisons\nto others with whom the subject in some ways sees himself as in\ncompetition. On this view, the characteristic dissatisfaction of envy\nsupplies or embodies some level of motivation toward whatever would\nameliorate the situation: in other words, toward either outdoing or\nundoing the rival\u2019s advantage Which of those motivations will emerge\nin action depends on many factors. It depends on what the situation\naffords, including the probabilities and expected costs and benefits\nof success at either option. And it depends on other attitudes and\ndesires of the subject, including how much he likes the rival, whether\nhe thinks it would be wrong to deprive him of the good, and how much\nthat wrongness matters to him.\n\nOn this view, there can still be cases of genuine envy in which the\nsubject would not take steps to undermine the rival. He would not even\npush a button to deprive the rival in secret\u2014because he likes\nthe rival, or because that would be a rotten thing to do to anyone.\nCall such a person a \u201cdecent envier.\u201d A decent envier may\nsincerely believe that he has no desire whatever that the rival lose\nthe good. He will be wrong about this, but it can still be true that\nhe would not act on that desire. The attribution of genuine envy in\nsuch a case nonetheless explains some things. It explains why even a\ndecent envier\u2019s pain is prone to go away, along with some of his\nambition to achieve the good, if the rival should lose it. Why should\nenvy go away in such cases, if all the envier wanted was to secure the\ngood himself? It also explains why even decent enviers may be more\nlikely to be amused by a story that shows the rival in a negative\nlight, and why they become drawn to other goods that the rival\nacquires within the scope of the rivalry. And it explains why some\npreviously decent enviers become indecent enviers, or at least become\naware of some ambivalence about the rival\u2019s possession of the\ngood, when their efforts to secure the good for themselves prove\nhopeless.\n\nIn cases of emulative desire, on the other hand, presumably none of\nthese things should be expected. So what deniers want to say about\nbenign envy is that either it is not really envy (it\u2019s just\nemulative desire, or something else in the neighborhood) or it is not\nreally benign. Whether the deniers\u2019 view should be preferred may hinge\non what explanatory advantages defenders of benign envy can offer for\na taxonomy that includes emulative desire as a species of envy. \n",
