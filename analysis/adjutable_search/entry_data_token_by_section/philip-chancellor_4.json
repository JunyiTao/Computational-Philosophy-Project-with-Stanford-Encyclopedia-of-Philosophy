    "main_text": "Philip\u2019s Psychology\n5. Philip\u2019s Psychology\n\n\nAlthough not as well known, Philip\u2019s psychology also exhibits\nsome innovative features and influenced later thinkers, in particular,\nAlbert the Great. In the early thirteenth century, theorists accounted\nfor human abilities by arguing that in order to do what they do,\nagents must possess certain capacities or powers. Thus for every\nability, there must be a corresponding and separate power. Human\nbeings have the ability to think; therefore, they must have a\ncognitive power, often called intellect or reason. Medieval\nphilosophers also adopted Aristotle\u2019s distinction between\npractical intellect, which discerns what to do, and speculative\nintellect, which discerns the truth about the way things are. Human\nbeings have the capacity for desire; therefore, they must have\nappetitive powers. Medieval philosophers distinguish between two kinds\nof appetite; a rational appetite, called the will, that is responsive\nto the dictates of the intellect, and an appetite that is responsive\nto sensory apprehension, called the sensory appetite. Since activities\nsuch as thinking and desiring are different sorts of activities, most\ntheorists thought of their corresponding powers, the (practical)\nintellect and the will, as separate. However, on Philip\u2019s\naccount, the practical intellect and the will are not separate powers\n(see McCluskey 2001). He argues that with respect to the capacity for\nperforming actions, there is only one power with two separate acts.\nPhilip gives a number of arguments for this position. One of them is\nparticularly interesting because Philip uses the doctrine of the\ntranscendentals to establish his conclusion that the practical\nintellect and will are one and the same power. Philip first notes that\nthe intellect and the will have different ends. The intellect, even as\npractical intellect, has truth as its goal or end since its job, so to\nspeak, is to ascertain the way things are, to make judgments about the\nstate of reality, including what alternatives for action are available\nfor the agent. The will, on the other hand, is an appetite for the\ngood; it inclines the agent toward what she judges to be good. Thus,\nits end is the good. But according to the doctrine of the\ntranscendentals, the true and the good differ only intensionally, not\nextensionally. Philip thinks that if the ends of the powers do not\ndiffer extensionally, then the powers themselves do not differ\nextensionally as well. Thus, with respect to action, there is only one\npower with two different acts, acts of conceiving and judging on the\none hand, and acts of desiring (the good) and willing on the other.\nTalking about the will is merely shorthand for referring to acts of\nwilling or desiring. Talking about the intellect is merely shorthand\nfor referring to certain cognitive judgments about what to do or how\nto act. \n\n\nAlthough Philip denies that the practical intellect and the will are\nseparate powers, he argues for a distinction among the various\napprehensive powers (McCluskey 2001). Thus, he sees a genuine\ndistinction between the speculative intellect, the practical\nintellect, imagination, and the sensory apprehensive powers. This is\nbecause what is apprehended by each of these powers is different in\nnature. Philip denies that any such distinction is present among\nmotive powers. Insofar as the appetite is moved by a sensory\napprehension, we call it the sensory appetite. Insofar as the appetite\nis moved by the judgment of intellect, we call it the will. However,\nin reality, there is only one motive power to account for both of\nthese sorts of desires, according to Philip. Philip\u2019s position\non the inseparability of practical intellect and will does not appear\nto have convinced his thirteenth-century contemporaries or\nnear-contemporaries. Albert the Great in Summa de homine\n(circa 1245) addresses the arguments given by Philip for his\nposition although as was the custom of the time with respect to\none\u2019s contemporaries or near-contemporaries, he does not refer\nto Philip by name. Albert rejects Philip\u2019s position, but the\nfact that Albert examines the issue at all indicates something about\nthe esteem given to Philip\u2019s work.\n\n\nAn important part of thirteenth-century psychology was the development\nof a theory of free action. This was especially important both for\ntheology and for ethics. Medieval thinkers, beginning with Augustine,\nrecognized that moral responsibility requires freedom and so the\npossibility of that freedom needed to be explained. Along those same\nlines, they argued that unless human beings are able to act freely,\nGod is not justified in punishing sins. Furthermore, human freedom\nplays a major role in theodicy; for example, Augustine argues that God\nis not responsible for the evil found in the world because that evil\nis perpetrated by the free choices of human beings (De lib\narb). Thus, given this background and these commitments, it was\ncommon for medieval philosophers to examine the topic of freedom\nsomewhere in their writings. In the first half of the thirteenth\ncentury, it was customary to examine these issues in the context of a\ntreatise on what became known as liberum arbitrium (see Kent\n1995, McCluskey 2001). In medieval theories of action in the early\npart of the thirteenth century, \u201cliberum\narbitrium\u201d is a technical term. It is a placeholder for\nwhatever it is that enables human beings to act freely. The term\noriginates in the work of Augustine who wrote a treatise\nentitled De libero arbitrio.  The starting point for\nthirteenth-century treatises on liberum arbitrium was a\ndefinition taken from Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences: \u201cliberum arbitrium is a faculty of\nreason and will, by which good is chosen with the assistance of grace,\nor evil, when grace is not there to assist. And it is called\n\u2018liberum\u2019 with respect to the will, which can be\nturned toward either [good or bad], while [it is called]\n\u2018arbitrium\u2019 with respect to reason, as it has to\ndo with that power or faculty to which the discerning between good and\nevil belongs.\u201d Although Lombard\u2019s main discussion\nof liberum arbitrium is found in book two, distinction\ntwenty-five of his Sententiae in IV libris distinctae, this\ndefinition is found in the twenty-fourth distinction of book two,\nchapter three. This definition was commonly but mistakenly attributed\nto Augustine by commentators in the thirteenth century. Lombard\nhimself does not reveal his source.  References to Augustine dominate\nhis discussion of liberum arbitrium, which might account for\nthe association of the definition with Augustine.\n\n\nPhilosophers in the early thirteenth century faced the task of how\nto understand this definition. Although it is obvious from Lombard\u2019s\nformulation that both intellect and will have something to do with\nliberum arbitrium, their exact relationship is unclear. The\nphrase \u201cliberum arbitrium\u201d itself contributes to\nthe uncertainty (on this issue, see Korolec 1982, McCluskey 2001). The\nfirst part of the phrase, \u201cliberum,\u201d is\nuncontroversial; it simply means \u201cfree.\u201d Difficulties\narise with respect to the notion of \u201carbitrium.\u201d\nThis notion has both cognitive and appetitive connotations, for it can\nhave meanings as diverse as \u201cjudgment,\u201d\n\u201cdecision,\u201d \u201cwish,\u201d or\n\u201cinclination.\u201d It can also refer to a power or ability to\nmake judgments or decisions or to the very agent who makes these\njudgments or decisions. Thus, the term covers a lot of territory,\nterritory that has to do with both cognitive and appetitive\ncapabilities. Accordingly, it is natural to connect\nliberum arbitrium with both intellect and will. In writing\ntreatises on liberum arbitrium, thirteenth-century\nphilosophers sought to sort out the connections between intellect and\nwill on the one hand and the production and freedom of human action on\nthe other. Some of these philosophers argued that free action results\nfrom the interaction of intellect and will, while others argued that\nalthough the intellect is an important precondition for an action\u2019s\nbeing free, the will is the true instrument that brings about a free\naction. Still others argued that liberum arbitrium is a\nseparate faculty altogether although it is closely linked with and\ninteracts with the intellect and will in the production of a free\naction. The practice of writing treatises on liberum arbitrium\nbegan to die off toward the later decades of the thirteenth century\nwhen philosophers started examining the topic of voluntas\nlibera (free will) instead (see Kent 1995, Lottin 1957).\n\n\nIn his treatise on liberum arbitrium in Summa de\nbono, Philip adopts John Damascene\u2019s basic description of action.\nAccording to Damascene, an eighth-century patristic, a number of\ndifferent stages come together in the production of an action. These\nstages include desiring, considering the various courses of action that\nwill satisfy one\u2019s desires, deliberating over those courses of action,\njudging which one is to be performed, willing and choosing a particular\nalternative, and initiating the action. Since each of these activities\nare activities of the will or of the intellect, it follows that actions\nresult from the activities of the will and the intellect. Damascene\nalso claims that each of these stages are performed freely. Because\neach stage is performed freely, the resulting action is also free.\n\n\nPhilip modifies this position (McCluskey 2001). He thinks that only\nthe final activity of the intellect is performed freely, that is, the\nfinal judgment about what course of action to take. This is because\nPhilip thinks that with respect to the previous activities of the\nintellect, activities such as identifying possible courses of action\nand deliberating over them, the intellect suffers from certain\nconstraints.  These constraints have to do with the structure of the\nworld around us which in turn structures our beliefs. Beliefs play a\nrole in our deliberations over what to do; thus the constraints placed\nupon beliefs in turn constrain the intellect in its activities. But\naccording to Philip, the intellect retains some freedom for the final\njudgment about what to do is made freely. Thus, the intellect need not\njudge that a particular course of action be performed; it could have\njudged differently. In Philip\u2019s view, the will does not suffer\nfrom such constraints. The will is an appetite for the good so that\nwhatever it wills, it wills a good. But a thing\u2019s being a good\nis merely a necessary condition, not a sufficient one. A thing\u2019s\nbeing good does not compel the will\u2019s act. Moreover, no judgment\nof the intellect constrains the will\u2019s choice; the will is free\neither to will the alternative put forth by the intellect or to reject\nit and will something else. It is because of this capacity of the will\nthat Philip sees the will as the primary source of freedom in a human\nbeing. For in the final analysis, it is the will rather than the\njudgment of the intellect that determines the action the agent\nperforms. Because the will wills freely, the agent performs the action\nfreely. Thus, while both intellect and will have important roles to\nplay in the production of a free action, freedom is primarily a\nfunction of the will. Philip\u2019s theory of action helps to set the\nstage for the prominent voluntarist movement that rose later in the\nthirteenth century with thinkers such as Peter John Olivi and John\nDuns Scotus (see Kent 1995, McCluskey 2001).\n",
