    "main_text": "Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy || Phylogenetics and Philosophy\n2.6 Phylogenetics and Philosophy\n\nThe philosophy of statistics is but one area among many where\nphilosophical arguments contribute to work in phylogenetics. Though\nphylogenetics is a subfield of biology (and, arguably, of statistics\nand computer science), phylogenetic inference is a topic on which both\nphilosophers and biologists work, often in overlapping ways. Indeed,\nthe boundary between science and philosophy here is blurry in a way\nreminiscent of some of the natural philosophy of the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries. An upshot of this is that phylogenetic inference\nis an enormously rich area for philosophers to explore. Biologists are\nactively debating the conceptual foundations of phylogenetic\nmethodology, justification, goals, explanatory models, etc. It is not\nuncommon to see philosophers playing a central role in these debates\n(e.g., Hull 1988; Sober 1988b). It also means that many biologists are\neager to engage with philosophers in meaningful and deeply informed\nways (e.g., Sterner & Lidgard 2018; Havstad & Smith 2019).\n\nPhylogenetic inference is, generally, best categorized as a problem of\nepistemology. It is, after all, a problem of inference, albeit\nspecialized to how we justify or ground our beliefs about phylogeny.\nAn epistemologist who wonders how we can have knowledge of the past\ncan hardly do better than to look to phylogenetics (Sober 1988b). And\nas we have seen, philosophy of statistics and of inductive inference\nmore generally looms large. But moving beyond epistemology, any\nphilosopher interested in how science works can learn from\nphylogenetics. Here we will look at the cases of metaphysics and the\ngeneral philosophy of science.\n2.6.1 Phylogenetic inference as general philosophy of science\n\nUnderstanding details of the evolutionary history of life is not\nsimply a stand-alone problem (as interesting as that problem would\nbe). The history of life and the history of the planet are tied\ntogether such that knowledge in one domain aids our inferences in the\nother. Knowing what types of fossils are embedded in rocks together\nwith a phylogeny can help scientists date the rocks just as dating the\nrocks through independent means aids in dating the fossils and thus in\nestimating aspects of the phylogeny (Grantham 2004). And just as the\nphysics and chemistry of the planet have shaped living things, life\nhas shaped the planet as well. Photosynthetic cyanobacteria were\npartially responsible for the great oxygenation event roughly 2.4\nbillion years ago, where oxygen build up in the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere fundamentally altered the chemistry and physics of the\nearth.\n\nThis entanglement with other sciences makes phylogenetics a rich\nsource for philosophers of science. It provides a model to better\nunderstand how science works when specialized fields inform and rely\non each other. Philosophers might draw on phylogenetics to better\nunderstand the social structure of complexes of sciences (Longino\n1990, 2019) (and complex sciences that draw on other fields), or to\ncharacterize what constitutes good scientific activity for what might\nbe called \u201cservice sciences\u201d, i.e., sciences whose\nproducts are largely used by other scientists as end-users.\n\nOne way to frame debates in the Systematics Wars is as scientists\nwrestling over the question of what constitutes good science. Here we\ntake the opportunity to highlight what may be an under-appreciated\naspect of this debate. Namely, does good science require theory?\nThough many of the traditional sciences studied by philosophers of\nscience are clearly driven by (or, at least, tightly linked to)\ntheory, this does not always appear to be the case for other sciences.\nContrast Newtonian mechanics or population genetics with, say, the\nstudy of stem cells (Fagan 2013) or developmental biology (Love 2014),\nwhere it is unclear whether there are any underlying\ntheoretical structures.\n\nIn the case of systematics, it is unclear how to articulate a\nprecise theory for any of these competing views. It is\nprobably more accurately portrayed as competing sets of commitments,\nsome of which may resemble (or be) scientific theories (depending on\nthe characterizations of \u201cscientific theory\u201d), where other\ncommitments might be better described in terms of scientific practice\nor mode of reasoning (Giere 1979 [1997]; Griesemer 2000).\n\nWhether and what the theoretical structure of phylogenetics is remains\nan open debate. Yet, though scientists that research, study, and\ndevelop phylogenetic methods have a lot at stake in these debates,\nmost of the end users of these methods are rather agnostic\nabout those competing methods (and, in many cases, the underlying\ntheories supporting those methods). In practice, most biologists that\nuse phylogenetic methods typically use lots of them.\nPhilosophers of science might consider whether this amounts to an\nadoption of methodological pluralism or theory agnosticism, and\nwhether trees produced under competing methodologies constitute robust\nresults (e.g., when identifying the same monophyletic groups or\nhomologies).\n\nPhylogenetic inference should also be of interest to a wider range of\nphilosophers for the way it can function as a case study for other\nphilosophical issues. The recent history of phylogenetics has provided\nphilosophers with test cases for how scientists shift from one set of\ncommitments to another (Hull 1988), for the role of inductive logic\nand probability in both explanation and model construction (Sober\n1988a,b; Haber 2005), and for what constitutes a good scientific\nexplanation (Felsenstein & Sober 1986; Sober 2004; Haber 2009).\nO\u2019Hara (1988) and Ereshefsky (2012) look to phylogenetics to see\nhow narrative or historical explanations function in the sciences.\nOther examples of philosophers using phylogenetics to assess\nphilosophical theses include Velasco (2012) and Vassend (2020) using\nphylogenetics to examine practices of modeling and idealization, and\nHaber (2005) looking at what phylogenetic inference tells us of how\nprobabilistic reasoning may be used to assess singular historical\nevents. Aleta Quinn proposes a taxonomy of disputes in contemporary\nsystematics that she argues stems from disputes over application of\nthe principle of total evidence (2019), and uses the case of\nphylogenetics to examine a well known objection leveled against\nproponents of inference to the best explanation in the sciences\n(2016), the \u201cbest of the bad lot argument\u201d (van Fraassen\n1989), or the \u201cunderconsideration objection\u201d (Lipton\n2004). And finally, Andreasen (1998, 2000) looks to phylogenetics to\nanswer the question of whether biological races are real.\n2.6.2 Phylogenetic inference as a problem of metaphysics\n\nThough phylogenetics as we described it is largely an epistemological\nenterprise, biological systematics as a whole is filled with important\nand controversial metaphysical issues which might seem to be largely\nindependent of problems of inference. Whether you treat taxa as\ntraditional natural kinds (Devitt 2008), homeostatic property clusters\n(Boyd 1999; Wilson, Barker, & Brigandt 2007), individuals\n(Ghiselin 1966, 1974; Hull 1976, 1978; Sober 1980; Ereshefsky 1991;\nHaber 2016a) or something else (Slater 2013, 2014) will typically\ncarry little to no impact on debates about phylogenetic\ninference\u2014especially as those played out in the philosophical\nliterature.\n\nYet, early phylogeneticists certainly saw metaphysical implications of\ntheir views, and this impacted how they approach the problem of\nreconstructing phylogeny. Simply put, if you think that taxa are\nhistorical entities, and that the aim of phylogeny is the\nreconstruction of their histories, the task is very different than if\nyou take the aim to be to find ahistorical similarities or shared\nessential characters (Hull 1970; Griffiths 1974). Though given the\nubiquitous adoption of the phylogenetic project (in a broad sense),\ndebates over how metaphysics ought to impact inferential methods\ncontinues in some areas of phylogenetics.\n\nDo competing metaphysical views in systematics impact phylogenetic\ninference? Yes, though only obliquely and indirectly, and it\u2019s\nvery important to take care not to conflate issues of classification\nwith the problem of reconstructing phylogenies\u2014even when they\noverlap. Let\u2019s take a very brief look at the former, followed by\nsome commentary on the oblique and indirect way it may overlap with\nphylogenetic inference.\n\nEreshefsky (2001) argues that a commitment to phylogenetic principles\nentails a reformation of the practice and norms around biological\nclassification. Specifically, he recommends leaving behind the\ntraditional Linnaean classification naming practices in favor of a\nphylogenetically informed practice. This follows a tradition stemming\nback to the very earliest phylogenetic literature that sought to\nreform biological classification around the principle of monophyly\n(e.g., Hennig 1966; Griffiths 1976; Wiley 1981). For many\nphylogeneticists this goal continues to this day\u2014most recently\naround the development of the PhyloCode (see\n Other Internet Resources;\n de Queiroz & Gauthier 1990, 1992, 1994; Cantino & de Queiroz\n2020). Though structural reforms to wholly replace Linnaean taxonomy\nhave struggled to gain wide-scale traction and adoption, taxonomists\nhave largely adopted monophyly as a guiding principle in\nclassification and systematics\u2014even in the context of so-called\ntraditional taxonomy (though microbial systematics has proven more\nresistant; see\n \u00a73.1).\n\nOf course, how biologists reconstruct a phylogeny and\nidentify monophyletic groups is a matter of taxonomic freedom on the\nPhyloCode and other phylogenetic classifications. That\u2019s just to\nsay that phylogenetic inference will operate largely independently of\nthese metaphysical and classificatory issues\u2014except insofar as\nthese classifications inform biologists about what it is that\nthey are aiming to reconstruct a history of in the first place. Haber\n(2019) provides a framing for this challenge, arguing that the units\nof phylogeny are the units of divergence and diversification. Where\nEreshefsky (2001) and other advocates of phylogenetic classification\nprovide a specific way of cashing out those units, Haber describes\nthis as a rich, general research project, similar to other\n\u201cunit\u201d problems in philosophy of biology. In much the same\nway that how we cash out, say, the units of selection may impact how\nwe study or draw inferences about evolutionary processes, how we\nidentify the units of divergence and diversification will impact how\nwe draw inferences in phylogenetics. (See de Queiroz 2007 for related\nfoundational issues.)\n\nPadian & Horner (2002) offer a coarse-grained example of how a\nmetaphysical commitment overlaps with issues of phylogenetic inference\nin their defense of treating Aves as the sole living branch of\ndinosaurs. In this case, they identify \u201ctransformationist\u201d\nthinking against typological thinking. In the former, the identity of\ntaxa is associated with historical continuity, and untethered from the\nexpression of any intrinsic characters. Thus, the transformation of\nancient theropod dinosaurs into the the living clade of birds means\nthat birds are dinosaurs, and that this ought to be reflected\nin our phylogenetic reconstructions. In contrast, they argue, a\ntypological account will treat birds as distinct from dinosaurs, and\nrisks a phylogenetic reconstruction that misrepresents the historical\nrelationship of these taxa. Moreover, they argue that\ntransformationist and typological approaches will differentially\ncategorize features of avian and ancient theropods as evidence and\ndata; what even counts as inferentially relevant is itself at stake.\nPadian and Horner, here, are identifying metaphysical commitments from\nphylogenetics to argue how paleontologists ought to reconstruct\nevolutionary history, what counts as evidence, and what kinds of\nevidence are important for drawing those inferences, i.e., how\ncharacters are coded is treated as a methodological dispute entailed\nby theoretical commitments. (See Haber 2016b in\n Other Internet Resources\n for further discussion.)\n3. Looking Ahead: New Challenges and Opportunities\n\nWe began by noting that a phylogeny reconstructs evolutionary history\nand that different types of entities have an evolutionary\nhistory\u2014for example, genes, organisms, populations, and species\nall have genealogical histories. Assume that we are trying to\nreconstruct the history of species or higher taxa (indeed,\n\u201cphylogeny\u201d itself is sometimes defined this way, e.g.,\nWiley 1981; S. Edwards 2009). Standard methods such as parsimony,\nlikelihood, and bayesian methods all directly infer the history of\ncharacters. So what is the connection between the history of these\ncharacters and the phylogeny of the species? The unstated assumption\nis that the histories of these characters are the same and line up\nwith the species history. We conclude this entry by acknowledging that\nthis unstated assumption is often violated and we consider what effect\nthis has on the theory and practice of phylogenetic inference. As we\nwill see, examining this unstated assumption forces us to directly\nface the question of what a phylogeny actually represents and thus\nwhat \u201cphylogenetic inference\u201d even means.\n\nIn order to facilitate an entry point into this topic we treated\nphylogenetic trees and the histories they represent as simple\nbifurcating entities, i.e., as straight-forward branch-and-node\nstructures. Yet, this is an idealization, and actual phylogenetic\nhistories are typically more complex than this. Branches can fuse\ntogether, and branching events turn out to be more complex than the\nunidimensional instantaneous point a node might suggest.\n\nAs philosophers of science are well aware, idealization in science is\nboth common and serves important purposes (e.g., Cartwright 1983;\nMcMullin 1985; Wimsatt 2007; Weisberg 2007). Yet, it can be fruitful\nto pause and consider if some of these idealizations and simplifying\nassumptions need to be re-examined, are hindering studies, or\ngenerating other road blocks. Indeed, that\u2019s precisely what has\nhappened recently in phylogenetics. Re-examining the utility of\nsimplifying assumptions in phylogenetics has come both from outside\nthe field (particularly from microbiology) and internally (as\nphylogeneticists began to appreciate what might be gained from\nincorporating more complexity). This is (or, at least, can be) a good\nand healthy thing for a science. It puts pressure on scientists and\nphilosophers to further articulate the central commitments of a\nscience, and to consider how to account for new challenges. Challenges\ncan also push a science to adapt and revise those central commitments\nas new evidence, theories, and tools are discovered or developed, or\nto revisit the utility of underlying simplifying assumptions and\nidealizations. This, in turn, helps philosophers of science understand\nhow science can advance. (Haber 2019 describes this in the context of\nphylogenetics as productive disruptions.)\n\nRevisiting the utility of idealizing away the complexity of\nphylogenetic histories has generated both hard challenges and new\nopportunities for phylogeneticists moving forward (Haber 2012, 2019;\nVelasco 2012). Here we provide a brief overview of what relaxing these\nassumptions amounts to, and what kinds of complexity we are\nacknowledging when these assumptions no longer hold. Following this,\nwe briefly describe how this impacts the central commitments and\nproject of phylogenetics.\n3.1 Reticulation & Discordance\n\nIn the previous sections we treated phylogenetic trees as\nstraight-forwardly bifurcating models, regularly referring back to\n Figure 1.\n Branches represent ancestral lineages, and nodes represent lineage\nsplits. Yet, this view of phylogenetics is also highly idealized,\nreflecting at least three simplifying assumptions: (1) that lineages\nsplit but do not fuse; (2) that changes on one lineage do not affect\nother lineages, and (3) that splits are singular, simple events. Each\nof these assumptions turn out to be false.\n\nIn order to think about how lineages split or fuse, we have to first\nanswer the question of what a lineage represents. In the case of a\nphylogeny where the tips are species, the natural answer is that the\nlineages are tracking species through time and the nodes represent\nspeciation events. But consider the assumption that lineages split but\ndo not fuse. For many readers, hybridization may be the most obvious\ncounter-example. After all, hybridization is relatively familiar,\nespecially for cases involving sexually reproducing charismatic\nmega-fauna and, even more frequently, plants.\n\nIn the case of speciation by hybridization, it is clear that entire\nlineages can fuse. Exactly how often this occurs is disputed and of\ncourse will depend on how you define species in the first place. But\nit is a widespread occurrence in plants and is known to happen in\nanimals as well (Mallet 2007; Schumer, Rosenthal, & Andolfatto\n2014).\n\nWhile most occurrences of hybridization do not lead to new species,\nmany often lead to introgression\u2013that is, the introduction of\ngenetic information from one lineage to another. If we model this as\none lineage connecting to another, we violate the assumption that a\nphylogeny is a strictly branching tree diagram. But if we instead do\nnot depict these lineages as directly connected, then we violate\nanother background assumption in phylogenetics, namely, that changes\nalong one branch do not affect any other branches. In either case, we\nnow have a situation where the branching history of some characters is\nnot the same as the history of others or of the history of the species\nas a whole. In the case of genetic history, this is known as\ngenealogical discordance.\n\nWhile hybridization among sexually reproducing species already\nprovides good counter-examples to our assumptions about the\nindependence of lineages, the bigger challenges have come from\n microbiology\n. More\nspecifically, what we find in microbial genomics are high levels of\nhorizontal (or lateral) gene transfer (HGT or LGT). For readers\nunfamiliar with microbial genomics, this can be thought of as the\nmicrobial analogue to hybridization, though there are important\nqualitative and quantitative differences.\n\nQualitatively, HGT is not a mode of reproduction, though it does\ninvolve the transfer of genomic parts between microbes. Unlike in\nreproduction, the genomic transfer is not (typically) between parent\nand offspring microbes, but adjacent ones. Roughly, when microbes make\ncontact, they can exchange parts of their genome, which means that the\nhistory of these genomic parts may be distinct from the history of the\nmicrobial organisms in which we find those genetic units. HGT can be\nhighly advantageous for microbes, and genomic parts can quickly spread\nthrough microbial populations, especially if they carry beneficial\ncharacteristics. Quantitatively, the rate of HGT in microbes is\nenormously high and commonplace, especially relative to hybridization\nin, say, mammalian species.\n\nThe upshot of widespread HGT is that microbial genes will frequently\nhave different histories, and genetic parts will sometimes flow from\none lineage to very distantly related lineages. Microbialists and\nphilosophers of biology have taken up the question of whether\nreticulation in microbial histories is enough to entirely undercut the\nutility of phylogenetics in microbial genomics, and how this has\nimpacted the utility of the tree of life metaphor more\ngenerally (e.g., Martin 1999; Doolittle 1999; Velasco 2013 see too the\nspecial issue of Biology & Philosophy [O\u2019Malley,\nMartin, & Dupr\u00e9 2010]).\n\nThe final simplifying assumption treats lineage splits as singular\nevents that wholly separate a lineage into two distinct new branches\nthat we can cleanly track. When we think about the process of\nspeciation, it is clear that speciation and lineage separation more\ngenerally is often not instantaneous (de Queiroz 1998; Harrison 1998).\nWhat is less clear is how this matters to phylogenetics. Thinking\ncarefully about lineage splits and the internal structure of lineages\nforces us to examine the nature and relationships of the multilevel\norganization of the lineages we track (Haber 2012, 2019). More\ninclusive lineages contain less-inclusive lineages as parts,\nreflecting the hierarchical organization found in biology\u2013a\nfeature of lineages well appreciated by early phylogeneticists, e.g.,\nHennig 1966; Griffiths 1974). Species trees, for example, contain gene\ntrees within their branches (Maddison 1997).\n\nWhen individual gene histories are incongruent with each other or with\ntheir containing species trees we have genealogical discordance. We\nhave already seen how hybridization and horizontal gene transfer can\ncause discordance, but as systematics has become increasingly\nconnected with population genetics, another source of discordance has\nloomed large\u2014incomplete lineage sorting. Any two copies of a\ngene in a population will share a common ancestor in the past called\ntheir point of coalescence. If two gene lineages in the same species\nlineage fail to coalesce within that species branch (that is, their\npoint of coalescence is earlier than than the most recent speciation\nor lineage branching) we have what is called incomplete lineage\nsorting (ILS). In a case of incomplete lineage sorting it is\npossible that one of the gene lineages first coalesces with a gene\nlineage from another species and thus is a case of genealogical\ndiscordance. This generates what Avise and Robinson (2008) have termed\nhemiplasies, i.e., homologous characters whose phylogenetic\nhistories are topologically discordant with higher level phylogenies\ndue to ILS. Maddison (1997) provides a very readable introduction to\nthe relationship between gene trees and species trees and the problems\nof genealogical discordance while Degnan and Rosenberg (2009) is a\nslightly more advanced introduction to the biology of incomplete\nlineage sorting and its affects on phylogenetic inference.\n\nTo summarize, we first discussed phylogenetic inference as it was\ntypically done prior to around the 1990s. First, infer the history of\na number of characters (for example, genes). Each of these histories\nis a particular, branching tree. Now assume that these histories are\nthe same as the species history. It is this assumption that allows\nmethods such as parsimony or likelihood to evaluate competing\nhypotheses. The species history is then also a branching tree even\nthough we know that in general, this is a kind of idealization\nassuming that (1) that lineages split but do not fuse, (2) that\ninformation is not transferred between lineages , and (3) that splits\nare singular, simple events. Each of these assumptions turn out to be\nfalse.\n3.2 Impacts on Phylogenetic Inference\n\nThe reticulation and genealogical discordance generated by\nhybridization, HGT, ILS, and other complexities stemming from the\nstructure and processes involving biological lineages have,\nhistorically, been obscured by idealizing assumptions in\nphylogenetics. In many cases treating phylogenetic trees as idealized\nmodels of genealogical history is useful and appropriate for the\nresearch question at hand.\n Figure 1\n offers a good example of this. This reflects how the level of\nresolution relative to our research questions can drive the way we use\nphylogenetic tools (O\u2019Hara 1993).\n\nBut what happens when these idealizing assumptions are critically\ninterrogated? First, the fact that different entities have different,\noften incompatible, genealogical histories brings into question the\nvery nature of phylogeny. One line of thought is that a phylogeny\nshould directly track genetic history rather than the history of\nspeciation. As Maddison (1995: 285) puts it,\n\n\none possible interpretation of a species phylogeny is that it depicts\nthe lines by which genetic information was passed on and nothing\nmore.\n\n\nBaum and Shaw (1995), Baum (2007), and Velasco (2010, 2019) represent\na series of papers devoted to developing this \u201cconcordance\ntree\u201d idea. Baum (2009) incorporates this line of thought about\nphylogenetic history into the debate over the nature of species and\nother taxa.\n\nPhilosophers have paid particular attention to reticulation in the\ncontext of microbial genomics, and for good reason (O\u2019Malley et\nal. 2010 is a notable special edition dedicated to this topic and is a\nuseful resource). These are often framed as challenges to the\nphylogenetic approach itself, or, in other cases, how and whether the\ntools of phylogenetics apply to microbial genomics (Martin 1999;\nDoolittle 1999). The breadth of HGT in microbial systems has also led\nto challenges to the more conceptual and metaphysical commitments\nabout species and other phylogenetic units (Franklin 2007).\n\nHowever, the majority of work in phylogenetics today continues with\nthe same goals as before, but with biologists using better and more\npowerful tools for incorporating these complexities into their\nphylogenetic models. Haber (2019) offers a philosophical treatment of\nhow reticulation and genealogical discordance introduces both\nchallenges and opportunities in the context of phylogenetic inference,\nasking whether the branches of phylogenetic trees are \u201ctoo\nthin\u201d and obscure relevant details found in the internal\nstructure of those lineages. There are a lot of good reasons\nphylogeneticists might aim to include reticulate structure in their\nphylogenetic reconstructions. Among other things, it means treating\ngenealogical discordance as data that can be mined, as opposed to\nnoise that needs to be filtered out (Haber 2012, 2019). Philosophers\nhave begun paying more attention to ways that reticulation and\ndiscordance have impacted phylogenetic inference beyond microbial\ngenomics. Rather than coming as challenges from cognate fields, these\ninclude ways that practicing phylogeneticists have sought to account\nfor and accommodate what we have come to understand about reticulation\nand discordance (see Haber & Molter 2019 for a special issue\ndedicated to this topic).\n\nPopulation biologists were among the first to operationalize methods\nfor extracting information about the history of lineages from the\ninternal structure of those lineages, i.e., by examining the structure\nof individuals in a populations, population biologists developed\nmethods for inferring historical coalescent points of those\nindividuals (Hudson 1983; Kingman 1982, 2000; Tajima 1983). These\nmethods exploit the fact that after a lineage splits it takes time for\nthat split to be wholly reflected in the kinship relations of the\nparts of those lineages. Or, to put it in more familiar terms, it\ntakes time for the parts of a lineage to all be more closely related\nto each other than any are to parts in other lineages These approaches\ncan be viewed as the continued development of methods in the larger\ncontext of the close ties between the application of statistical tools\nand molecular biology\n (\u00a71.2.3).\n\nMaddison (1997) represents a more recent launching point for a new\nappreciation of the role that the internal structure of lineages can\nplay in phylogenetic inference. Briefly, the continued advancement of\nmolecular and computational techniques provided the opportunity to\nproduce ever-finely resolved phylogenies of the systems of interest.\nWhat quickly became apparent was a confirmation of what is only\nimplicit in Hennig (1966): that the hierarchical structure of taxa may\nresult in discordant phylogenies at different levels (or even within\nlevels) of the biological hierarchy. As an example, Maddison describes\nhow the phylogenies of individual genes or nucleotides may display\ndifferent phylogenetic topographies from the organisms or populations\nin which we sampled those genes. This is not a result of error or\nhomoplasy, but of genuine phylogenetic discordance between gene level\nlineages and the higher-level lineages in which they reside.\n\nMaddison (1997) is also directly about how we ought to incorporate\nwhat we learn about the internal structure of lineages into our models\nof phylogenetic inference, and how we might build on the earlier work\non coalescent models. Maddison is among the first to deeply appreciate\nhow impactful the then-new work on genomics might be for\nphylogenetics, both in the ways that discordance will present serious\nchallenges and opportunities for phylogenetic inference. This has\nhelped spur new developments in this field of phylogenetics, (e.g.,\nMaddison & Knowles 2006; Degnan & Rosenberg 2006, 2009; Baum\n2007; Nakhleh 2013; Hahn & Nakhleh 2016; Mallet, Besansky, &\nHahn 2016).\n\nHaber (2019) offers two reasons why these new developments in\nphylogenetic inference should be of interest to philosophers. First,\nhe offers a real-time example of scientists shifting from treating a\nfeature of a system as noise to recognizing it as powerful evidence.\nPease et al. (2016) is a prime example of this. They use some of the\nnew tools developed to draw phylogenetic inference in highly\ndiscordant systems to offer a reconstruction of the tomato clade.\nWhere earlier analyses regarded the system as too noisy to pull out a\nstrong phylogenetic signal, these new models permitted a\nreconstruction that recognized specific patterns of discordance. This\nrepresents a substantial advancement in the level of resolution\nphylogeneticists are able to reconstruct and identify.\n\nSecond, the new attitudes toward discordance and reticulation in\nphylogenetics provide an example of a community of scientists shifting\nfrom one set of commitments to another. Haber (2019) offers a specific\nexample. He describes one of the entrenched core commitments in\nphylogenetic methodology as being the goal of \u201cresolving\u201d\ncompeting phylogenetic trees (Felsenstein 1988). That is, in cases\nwhere different analyses or data are generating conflicting\nphylogenetic trees, the goal should be to resolve this conflict by\nidentifying which of those trees is best supported. On a model that\nrecognizes genealogical discordance, though, conflicting trees may\naccurately reflect a reticulate or discordant phylogenetic history,\ne.g., if different data strongly support different phylogenetic trees,\none possible explanation is that we have discovered an instance of\ndiscordance. Nakhleh (2013) recommends that this entails that\nphylogeneticists must now also consider whether conflicting trees may\nbe \u201creconciled\u201d rather than resolved. Haber (2019) argues\nthat this is an example of what he calls a \u201cproductive\ndisruption\u201d, which is one way that science might advance.\n\nThe conceptual and epistemological impacts of discordance on\nphylogenetic inference come together in recent debates over Sukumaran\nand Knowles\u2019 (2017) work and commentary on the multispecies\ncoalescent (Rannala & Yang 2003; Yang & Rannala 2010). Very\nroughly, the multispecies coalescent extends the principle of the\ncoalescent from population genetics to phylogenetics. In population\ngenetics, a gene can be sampled from multiple individuals in a single\npopulation; coalescent theory provides a way to model the ancestral\nhistory of that gene to a common ancestor, i.e., where that history\ncoalesces. The multispecies coalescent does something similar, but\nwith samples from multiple populations (or even species). These and\nother techniques were developed in response to the challenge posed by\nMaddison (1997) to develop methods that recognize speciation as an\nextended process. Roughly, the lineages of genes, individual\norganisms, populations, and species within a taxa can all \u201ccome\napart\u201d, or have different phylogenetic histories, and display\n\u201ca fractal hierarchy of divergences\u201d (Sukumaran &\nKnowles 2017: 1607). Multispecies coalescent techniques help reveal\nthe fine-grained structure of complex multi-level lineages (Haber\n2012), which has generated discussion on how these internal lineage\nstructures relate to species delimitation and other phylogenetic\ninferences (e.g., de Queiroz 2007; Knowles & Carstens 2007; Haber\n2012; Carstens, Pelletier, Reid, & Satler 2013; Hahn & Nakhleh\n2016; Mallet et al. 2016; Velasco 2019).\n\nSukumaran and Knowles (2017) provide a good example of the discussions\nover what kinds of inferences are licensed by the multispecies\ncoalescent, and the way that metaphysical concerns overlap with\nepistemological ones. They focus on what kinds of inferences may be\ndrawn from multispecies coalescent methods, arguing that it is a\nmistake to simply treat the units identified by these methods as\nspecies, when they may turn out to be population-level structures\ninstead (i.e., populations of a species, rather than distinct\nspecies). They seek to highlight that mistaking population structures\nfor species (or too quickly drawing the inference of the latter from\nthe former, without further evidence), can undermine precisely the\nsorts of inferences that phylogenetics seeks to license by\nartificially and unjustifiably inflating species counts:\n\n\nSpecifically, all fields that rely on species as units of analysis,\nfrom conservation biology to studies of macroevolutionary dynamics,\nwill be impacted by inflated estimates of the number of species,\nespecially as genomic resources provide unprecedented power for\ndetecting increasingly finer-scaled genetic structure under the\nmultispecies coalescent. (Sukumaran & Knowles 2017: 1607)\n\n\nThis may be framed as a claim about the units of divergence and\ndiversification being identified by these multispecies coalescent\nmethods (a metaphysical claim), and the sorts of inferences that may\nbe drawn about those units from these methods (an epistemological\nclaim) (Haber 2019).\n\nTo be clear, the relation between the metaphysics and epistemology is\nnot direct, but oblique, yet important in regard to the inferences\nlicensed by phylogenetic methods. Sukumaran and Knowles (2017), for\nexample, conclude by issuing a plea for phylogeneticists to exercise a\nmore careful stance towards relying on genomic data alone, and in\nusing multispecies coalescent as a straight-forward way to identify\nspecies. They instead propose a more cautious inferential stance,\nidentifying the units identified by the multispecies coalescent as\npopulation-level structures (which may or may not correspond to\nspecies delimitation). This is merely an example of the rich sorts of\ndiscussions around good scientific inference that is available to\nphilosophers willing to dive into this literature.",
