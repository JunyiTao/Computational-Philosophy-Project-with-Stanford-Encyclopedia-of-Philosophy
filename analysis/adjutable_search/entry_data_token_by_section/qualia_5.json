    "main_text": "Qualia and Introspection\n6. Qualia and Introspection\n\nIn the past, philosophers have often appealed directly to\nintrospection on behalf of the view that qualia are intrinsic,\nnon-intentional features of experiences. Recently, a number of\nphilosophers have claimed that introspection reveals no such qualities\n(Harman 1990, Dretske 1995, Tye 1995, 2000). Suppose you are facing a\nwhite wall, on which you see a bright red, round patch of paint.\nSuppose you are attending closely to the color and shape of the patch\nas well as the background. Now turn your attention from what you see\nout there in the world before you to your visual experience. Focus\nupon your awareness of the patch as opposed to the\npatch of which you are aware. Do you find yourself suddenly\nacquainted with new qualities, qualities that are intrinsic to your\nvisual experience in the way that redness and roundness are qualities\nintrinsic to the patch of paint? According to some philosophers, the\nanswer to this question is a resounding \u2018No\u2019. As you look\nat the patch, you are aware of certain features out there in the\nworld. When you turn your attention inwards to your experience of\nthose features, you are aware that you are having an\nexperience of a certain sort but you aware of the very same\nfeatures; no new features of your experience are revealed. In this\nway, your visual experience is transparent or diaphanous. When you try\nto examine it, you see right through it, as it were, to the qualities\nyou were experiencing all along in being a subject of the experience,\nqualities your experience is of. \n\nThis point holds good, according to the philosophers above, even if\nyou are hallucinating and there is no real patch of paint on the wall\nbefore you. Still you have an experience of there being a\npatch of paint out there with a certain color and shape. It\u2019s\njust that this time your experience is a misrepresentation. And if you\nturn your attention inwards to your experience, you will\n\u2018see\u2019 right through it again to those very same\nqualities.\n\nThese observations suggest that qualia, conceived of as the\nimmediately \u2018felt\u2019 qualities of experiences of\nwhich we are cognizant when we attend to them introspectively, do not\nreally exist. The qualities of which we are aware are not qualities of\nexperiences at all, but rather qualities that, if they are qualities\nof anything, are qualities of things in the world (as in the case of\nperceptual experiences) or of regions of our bodies (as in the case of\nbodily sensations). This is not to say that experiences do not have\nqualia. The point is that qualia are not qualities of experiences.\nThis claim, which will be developed further in the next section, is\ncontroversial and some philosophers deny outright the thesis of\ntransparency with respect to qualia (see Block 1991, 2000; Stoljar\n2004; Nida-R\u00fcmelin 2007). According to Block, for example, qualia\nare not presented to us in introspection as intrinsic, non-intentional\nproperties of our experiences. Still it does not follow from this that\nwe are not introspectively acquainted with such properties. For we do\nknow on the basis of introspection what it is like to undergo a visual\nexperience of blue, say. So, if what a state is like is a matter of\nwhich intrinsic, non-intentional properties it tokens, then obviously\nwe are introspectively aware of properties of this sort (in the de re\nsense of \u2018of\u2019). On this view, whether qualia are\nproperties of experiences (in particular, intrinsic, non-intentional\nproperties) is a theoretical matter. Introspection does not settle the\nmatter one way or the other.\n",
