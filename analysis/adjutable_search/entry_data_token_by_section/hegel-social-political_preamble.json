    "main_text": "\n\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831) developed a philosophy\nbased on freedom within a wider philosophical system offering novel\nviews on topics ranging from property and punishment to morality and\nthe state.\n\nHegel\u2019s main work was the Elements of the Philosophy of\nRight (\u201cPR\u201d) first published in 1821. Many of\nhis other major works include discussions or analyses connected to his\nsocial and political philosophy. He also wrote various political essays\nduring his career, many of which have been translated (Hegel 1999). His\nwork has been a major influence on significant figures from Karl Marx\nto Charles Taylor and beyond.\n\nThis entry provides an overview about how Hegel\u2019s ideas have\nbeen debated and the core contributions from his PR followed\nby further readings.\n",
