    "main_text": "Trope Applications || Tropes in Causation and Persistence\n4.1 Tropes in Causation and Persistence\n\nAccording to a majority of the trope theorists, an important reason\nfor thinking tropes exist is the role they play in causation. It is\nafter all not the whole stove that burns you, it is its temperature\nthat does the damage. And it is not any temperature, nor temperature\nin general, which leaves a red mark. That mark is left by the\nparticular temperature had by this particular stove now. It makes\nsense, therefore, to say that the mark is left by the stove\u2019s\ntemperature-trope, which means that tropes are very good\ncandidates for being the world\u2019s basic causal relata (Williams\n1953a; Campbell 1990; Denkel 1996; Molnar 2003; Heil 2003; ;\nGarcia-Encinas 2009; Ehring 2011).\n\nThat tropes can play a role in causation can hardly be\ndoubted. But can this role also provide the trope-proponent with a\nreason to think that tropes exist? According to the theory\u2019s\ncritics, it cannot. The role tropes (can) play in causation does not\nprovide the trope proponent with any special reason to prefer an\nontology of tropes over alternative ontologies. More specifically, it\ndoes not give her any special reason to prefer an ontology of tropes\nover one of states of affairs or events. Just like tropes, state of\naffairs and events are particular. Just like tropes, they are\nlocalized. And, just like tropes, they are non-repeatable (although at\nleast the state of affairs contains a repeatable item\u2014the\nuniversal\u2014as one of its constituents). Every reason for thinking\nthat tropes are the world\u2019s basic causal relata is therefore\nalso a reason to think that this role is played by states of affairs\nand/or\n events.[32]\n\nEhring disagrees. To see why, he asks us to consider the following\nsimple scenario: a property-instance at t1 is\ncausally responsible for an instance of the same property at\nt2. This is a case of causation which is also a\ncase of property persistence. But what does property\npersistence involve? According to Ehring, property persistence is not\njust a matter of something not changing its properties. For, even in\ncases where nothing discernibly changes, the property instantiated at\nt1 could nevertheless have been replaced by\nanother property of the same type during the period between\nt1 and t2. To be able to\nontologically explain the scenario, therefore, we first need an\naccount of property persistence able to distinguish \u2018true\u2019\nproperty persistence from cases of \u2018non-salient property\nchange\u2019 or what may also be called property type\npersistence. But, Ehring claims, this is something a theory according\nto which property instances are states of affairs cannot do (this he\ndemonstrates with the help of a number of thought experiments, which\nspace does not allow me to reproduce here, but cf. Ehring\n1997: 91ff). Therefore, causation gives us reason to think that tropes\nexist.\n\nEhring is not the only one who regards the relationship between\n(theories of) persistence and tropes as an intimate one. According to\nMcDaniel (2001)\u2014who defends a theory (TOPO) according to which\nordinary physical objects are mereological fusions of monadic and\npolyadic tropes\u2014adopting (his version of) the trope view can be\nused to argue for one particular theory of persistence:\n 3-dimensionalism.[33]\n And according to Benovsky (2013), because (non-presentist)\nendurantism is incompatible with the view that properties are\n(immanent) universals, the endurantist must embrace trope\n theory.[34]\n\nAccording to Garcia (2016), finally, what role tropes can play in\ncausation will depend on how we conceive of the nature of tropes. If\ntropes are what he calls \u2018modifiers\u2019, they do not have the\ncharacter they confer, a fact that would seem to make them less\nsuitable as causal relata. Not so if tropes are of the module kind\n(and so have the character they confer). But if tropes have the\ncharacter they confer, Garcia points out, we may always ask, e.g.: Is\nit the couch or is it the couch\u2019s couch-shaped mass-trope that\ncauses the indentation in the carpet? Garcia thinks we have reason to\nthink they both do. The couch causes the indentation by courtesy, but\nthe mass trope would have sufficed to cause it even if it had existed\nalone, unbundled with the couch\u2019s other tropes. But this\nsuggests that if tropes are of the module kind, we end up with a world\nthat is (objectionably) systematically causally overdetermined. The\nrole tropes play in causation may therefore be more problematic than\nwhat it might initially seem (though cf. Giberman 2022 for an\nobjection to Garcia\u2019s argument).\n",
