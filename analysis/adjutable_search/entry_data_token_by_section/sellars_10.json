    "main_text": "Practical Reason:  Intentions, Rules, and Normativity || Oughts\n7.2 Oughts\nSellars\u2019s unified treatment of the modalities as material\nmode expressions of our inferential endorsements and commitments has\nbeen mentioned above.  It applies to the deontic modalities as well:\nthey signal the endorsement of certain practical inferences and\nprinciples.  We can see this clearly in his treatment of hypothetical\noughts.  An important fact about statements of the form\nIf X wants A, he ought to do B\nis that they do not permit what we might call unconditional\ndetachment.  Suppose\nIf Harry wants his inheritance now, he ought to kill his\nfather\nand suppose\nHarry wants his inheritance now.\nWe do not draw the unalloyed conclusion\nHarry ought to kill his father.\nThe reasonableness of killing his father remains strictly relative\nto Harry\u2019s desire and does not achieve the objective status\nsignaled by unconditional detachment. The choices we make are,\neffectively, always of encompassing alternatives, but the\nconsiderations we bring to bear on those choices are always only\npartial.\n\n[A]lthough the \u2018ought\u2019 of\nIf X wants A, he ought to\ndo B\nlooks as though it concerned the propriety of doing B on a\ncertain hypothesis, it actually concerns the logical propriety or\nimpropriety of certain complex valuings.  To offer advice of the\nform\nIf you want A you ought to do B\nis not to offer substantive advice as does\nYou ought to do X\nIt is to give logical advice (OMP: 8).\n\nTo give substantive advice, to be able to detach the\n\u2018ought\u2019 statement, we need to eliminate the subjectivity\nof the condition in the hypothetical; we need at least something that\nwould make a coherent all-things-considered option.  For a\nmoral ought, we would seek a categorically reasonable\nintention, one that would be reasonable for anyone and everyone to\nhave.  \nSellars approaches the search for a categorically reasonable\nintention in several steps.  A hypothetical intention that is at least\nuniversal in content takes an important step towards an\n\u2018ought\u2019 that we can count as objectively moral.  Sellars\nasserts that \u201cthe hypothetical imperative which comes closest to\ncapturing the moral point of view is that of impartial\nbenevolence\u201d (SM VII \u00a7100: 212).  Such an intention\nduplicates the universality of content that he thinks\nfull-fledged moral \u2018oughts\u2019 must have, but it still lacks\nthe universality in form a moral \u2018ought\u2019 needs,\nbecause it depends on the possession of a particular desire (impartial\nbenevolence) on the part of the agents. Intending impartial benevolence lacks universal form to the extent that such an intention remains the subjective possession of separate individuals who may have parallel intentions without yet having a shared intention.  \nIn order to make intelligible such universality in form, Sellars\nintroduces the notion of a we-intention, an intention that is not the merely\nsubjective possession of an individual, but an intention had as a member of\na group that constitutes us.  There can be things I intend, as\none of us, that I do not (or would not) intend, speaking on my\nown behalf.  For instance, I might intend, as a citizen of the U.S.,\nthat the representatives duly elected in the last election take\noffice, even though, speaking for myself, I am horrified at the\nprospect.  Sellars thus suggests that the we-intention\nIt shallwe be the case that our welfare is\nmaximized\nconstitutes a categorically reasonable intention.  This intention\ndoes seem to have an authority which is more than a mere\nmatter of its being generally accepted. It is a conceptual fact that\npeople constitute a community, a we, by virtue of thinking of each\nother as one of us, and by willing the common good not under the\nspecies of benevolence \u2014 but by willing it as one of us, or from\na moral point of view (SM VII \u00a7132: 222).\nThis is Sellars\u2019s reconstruction of the basic logic of moral\njudgments.  What remains is to construct an argument demonstrating the\nreality of the moral community, that there really is an appropriate\n\u2018we\u2019 to invoke.  Sellars thinks this could be done if the\nfollowing claims can be justified (SM VII \u00a7144: 225):\n\nTo think of oneself as rational being is (implicitly)\nto think of oneself as subject to epistemic oughts binding on rational\nbeings generally.\nThe intersubjective intention to promote epistemic welfare\nimplies the intersubjective intention to promote welfare sans\nphrase.\n\nWhile he thinks the first is plausible, Sellars does not claim to\nhave an argument for the second, so the question of the reality of the\nmoral community remains problematic. For further examination of Sellars\u2019 ethics and an argument that the moral community is real enough, see Koons (2019).\n",
