    "main_text": "The Transcendental Deduction || The Second Step of the B-Deduction\n1.5 The Second Step of the B-Deduction\n\nIn \u00a720 Kant, draws a conclusion from the considerations he has so\nfar advanced: \u201cConsequently, the manifold in a given intuition\nis necessarily subject to the categories\u201d (B143). One might\nthink that this is precisely what Kant intended to establish in the\nTranscendental Deduction, and thus that the argument is brought to an\nend in \u00a720. However, in \u00a721 he indicates that the\nTranscendental Deduction is not yet complete: \u201cThus in the above\nproposition a beginning is made of a deduction of the pure concepts of\nunderstanding\u201d (B144). Kant goes on to explain:\n\nIn what follows (cf. \u00a726) it will be shown, from the mode in\nwhich the empirical intuition is given in sensibility, that its unity\nis no other than that which the category (according to \u00a720)\nprescribes to the manifold of a given intuition in general. Only thus,\nby demonstration of the a priori validity of the categories\nin respect of all objects of our senses, will the purpose of the\ndeduction by fully attained. (B144\u20135)\n\n\nHere a perennial interpretive question arises: how should we construe\nthe argument we find in \u00a726, together with material from\n\u00a724, which is sometimes designated as the second step of the\nB-Deduction?\n\nOne position on this interpretive issue is advanced by Erich Adickes\n(1889: 139\u20134) and H. G. Paton (1936, v. 1: 501), who argue that\nwhile the material that precedes \u00a721 constitutes an\nobjective deduction, material in \u00a724 and \u00a726\ncomprise a subjective deduction. This distinction has its\nsource in the Preface to the A edition:\n\nThis enquiry, which is somewhat deeply grounded, has two sides. The\none refers to the objects of pure understanding, and is intended to\nexpound and render intelligible the objective validity of its a\npriori concepts. It is therefore essential to my purposes. The\nother seeks to investigate the pure understanding itself, its\npossibility and the cognitive faculties upon which it rests: and so\ndeals with it in its subjective aspect. Although this latter\nexposition is of great importance for my chief purpose, it does not\nform an essential part of it. (Axvi\u2013xvii)\n\n\nHenrich (1968\u201369) rejects the Adickes/Paton proposal for the\nreason that in \u00a721 Kant states that the demonstration of the\nvalidity of the categories is completed only in \u00a726, and the\npassage from the A-Preface indicates that this is a task for the\nobjective deduction. In defense of Adickes and Paton, in \u00a720 Kant\nclaims to have established that the categories apply to the manifold\nin any one given intuition, and affirms that he will now show that\ncategories apply to any object presented to the senses. In view of the\naim of the objective deduction, this move would seem to require only a\nstraightforward and trivial application of the result of \u00a720 to\nany empirical intuition we might have (as many commentators have\nnoted). So, on a charitable interpretation of Kant\u2019s agenda,\nshowing that the categories apply to any object presented to the\nsenses plausibly involves considerations beyond the scope of the\nobjective deduction.\n\nHenrich points out that although in the B-Deduction Kant sought to\navoid the problems of a subjective deduction, this \u201cdoes not\nmean that he neglected the demand for an explanation of the\npossibility of relating the categories to intuitions.\u201d However,\nby Kant\u2019s account, a subjective deduction features not only an\nexamination of cognitive faculties, but also an investigation of\n\u201cthe possibility of the pure understanding,\u201d which would\ninclude an investigation of how the categories are related to a priori\nand to empirical intuition and to the objects presented to us in such\nintuition. This is precisely the type of inquiry that we encounter in\n\u00a724 and \u00a726 \u2013 and Henrich agrees. Thus it seems that\nthe views of Henrich, Paton, and Adickes can be reconciled: they\nconcur that the second step aims to show how it is that the categories\nare related to objects of intuition and thus of experience in such a\nway as to demonstrate that they correctly apply to them.\n\nAnil Gomes (2010) proposes a more precise hypothesis for what is\nmissing in the first step that is addressed by the second step. Gomes\nfirst appeals to a problem James van Cleve (1999) raises for the\nTranscendental Deduction. Even if Kant succeeds in showing that\nsynthesis involves judging, and that judging involves the application\nof the categories.\n\nthis would not be enough for his purposes. For that result in\nconjunction with the rest of the Transcendental Deduction would yield\nno conclusion stronger than this: all my representations are connected\nin judgements that use Kant\u2019s categories. But Kant wants to show\nthat the categories are objectively valid \u2013 that they actually\napply to objects of experience. (van Cleve 1999: 89)\n\n\nKant hasn\u2019t established, according to van Cleve, that the\ncategories actually apply to experience. As Gomes (2010: 121) puts it,\n\u201cperhaps our application of the categories in experience is\nalways mistaken, and there is nothing which corresponds to the way in\nwhich we have synthesized the manifold.\u201d As he points out, the\nsecond step reaches its conclusion through the analysis of the\nstructure of our representation of space and time, from which Kant\nthen draws the conclusion that space and time themselves feature that\nstructure (Gomes 2010: 130; he cites a similar claim by Longuenesse\n1998, 213). If space and time do feature the structure of our\nrepresentations of them, then the requisite correspondence is in\nplace, and van Cleve\u2019s objection is answered.\n\nThis is a contending and plausible hypothesis for a role for the\nsecond step in the B-Deduction. One might ask, however, whether the\naccount Kant provides can respond convincingly to van Cleve\u2019s\nobjection. Even on certain idealist views, such as Leibniz\u2019s and\nKant\u2019s according to Robert Adams (1983, 1994: 217\u201361, cf. Wilson\n1987), our ordinary sensible representations of space, and of physical\nentities more generally, may not represent them as they really are. By\ncontrast, on Berkeley\u2019s idealist position as represented in the\nthird of the Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous\n(Berkeley 1713/1998), the properties of physical entities match our\nsensible representations of them exactly, without a possibility of a\nmismatch; the oar in the water really is bent when I see it as bent.\nOn the type of idealism Kant endorses (and one might of course\nquestion whether it has been established), the possibility of a\nmismatch remains in place even if our representation of space\nstructures space itself (Pereboom 1988; Stang 2018; Jauernig 2021).\nFor instance, we may sensibly represent space as Euclidean while is in\nfact Riemannian. One might respond that the representation that\nstructures space would then also be Riemannian, and we would have a\nmatch. But then a crucial feature of our representation of space would\nbe inaccessible absent serious empirical investigation, and the nature\nof the project would be altered.\n\nThe core text that divides interpretations of the second step is the\nnote to B160\u20131:\n\nSpace, represented as object (as is really required in geometry),\ncontains more than the mere form of intuition, namely the\ncomprehension of the manifold given in accordance with the form of\nsensibility in an intuitive representation, so that the form of\nintuition merely gives the manifold, but the formal intuition gives\nthe unity of the representation. In the Aesthetic I ascribed this\nunity merely to sensibility, only in order to note that it precedes\nall concepts, though to be sure it presupposes a synthesis, which does\nnot belong to the senses but through which all concepts of space and\ntime first become possible. For since through it (as the understanding\ndetermines the sensibility) space or time are first given as\nintuitions, the unity of this a priori intuition belongs to space and\ntime, and not to the concepts of the understanding (\u00a724).\n\n\nIt\u2019s widely agreed that a crucial feature of the second step is\nthe claim that our intuitions of space and time are constituted in\nsuch a way as to necessitate the unification of the manifold of\nappearance by the application of the categories. In the Transcendental\nAesthetic, Kant aimed to show that space and time are forms of our\nsensible intuition, and that for us appearances can only occur in\naccord with these forms. But now, in the note to B160\u20131, Kant draws\nour attention to the fact that space and time are not only forms of\nintuition, but are intuitions themselves, and that they are intuitions\nthat feature unity. What\u2019s more, Kant specifies that this unity\n\u2018precedes all concepts, though to be sure it presupposes a\nsynthesis, which does not belong to the senses but through which all\nconcepts of space and time first become possible.\u2019 By the\nsynthesis that is presupposed \u2018the understanding determines the\nsensibility.\u2019 So the unity of space and time is to be explained\nwith reference to the effect of the understanding upon sensibility\nitself (Longuenesse 1998: 211\u201333; Keller 1998: 88\u201394;\nDickerson 2004: 196\u2013201; Pollok 2008; Vinci 2014: 197\u2013229;\nOnof and Schulting 2015; Allison 2015: 374\u2013432; Rosefeldt 2022).\n\nThe text, and in particular the B160\u20131 note, gives rise to a number of\ninterpretive issues for Kant\u2019s overall position. One is whether\nhere Kant countenances a kind of unity in our representations that is\nnot a result of categorical synthesis, but is instead is independent\nof the categories. Hermann Cohen (1871/1987, 1907) and Eric Dufour\n(2003) are strict categorical conceptualists about any such unity,\nwhile Martin Heidegger (1929/1997) argues that there is a unity that\nis accounted for by the productive imagination independently of the\ncategories; (Lorne Falkenstein 1995, Michel Fichant 1997, Robert Hanna\n2008, 2011, Stephanie Gr\u00fcne 2011, Dennis Schulting 2012b, James\nMessina 2014, Colin McLear 2015, and Jessica Wilson 2018 also defend\nnonconceptualist positions on this score; see McLear 2014, 2020 for\noverviews). Longuenesse (1998) contends that unity-yielding synthesis\nis always a function of the understanding, but that there is a kind of\nsynthesis of the understanding that does not involve the categories,\nwhile it yet anticipates them. Messina (2014), McLear (2015), Onof and\nSchulting (2015), and Wilson (2018) argue that there are multiple\nkinds of unity for Kant, and while some require categorical synthesis,\nothers do not. In particular, they maintain that space as intuited by\nus has a unity that Onof and Schulting (2015) call unicity, which\nconsists of its singularity, its infinity, and its mereological\ninversion, i.e., a metaphysical structure involving parts\nontologically depending on the whole, by contrast with the whole\nontologically depending on parts, as is the case for material objects\ngenerally (here see Desmond Hogan 2021). Intuitive awareness of space\nas featuring unicity does not, on their account, require categorical\nsynthesis.\n\nAs Tobias Rosefeldt (2022) points out, a longstanding puzzle for the\nB160\u20131 note is that it references a notion of synthesis that precedes\nall concepts, while the notion of synthesis to which Kant appeals in\nthe preceding sections of the B-Deduction is one that does employ\nconcepts, i.e., the categories, and thus does not precede concepts.\nCommentators generally agree that this synthesis that precedes all\nconcepts must be subject to the unity of apperception (e.g., Messina\n2014, Williams 2018), but how might it be more thoroughly\ncharacterized? Rosefeldt proposes an account of the second step that\nat this point features the notion of a decomposing synthesis, which\ncontrasts with a composing synthesis. Kant, as he points out,\nintroduces the notion of a decomposing synthesis only in the Second\nAntinomy (A505/B533, A524/B552), but in Rosefeldt\u2019s view this\nnotion is aptly suited for Kant\u2019s objectives for the second\nstep. While a compositional synthesis constructs a whole from given\nparts,a decomposing synthesis begins with a given whole and then\ndecomposes it in some way into parts. In this context, it decomposes\nspace as we are intuitively aware of it into one or more of its finite\nparts, such as spheres or cubes, while the remaining infinite spatial\nregion excluded by those parts is represented as their phenomenal\nbackground or horizon (cf., Husserl 1913, 1939). \n\nA test for this proposal is how a decomposing synthesis might\nrepresent space given that we conceptualize it as infinite. On\nRosefeldt\u2019s account, the decomposition into finite parts may\ninvolve imaginatively drawing line segments that form a square. We can\nsubsequently extend these lines in the imagination, and we are\nconscious that we can freely vary the lines so that \u201chowever\nlarge the finite space that we construct by drawing lines is, this\nspace will always only be phenomenally present to us within the\nhorizon of a still larger unlimited space.\u201d This does not amount\nto intuiting space as infinite, but rather coming to understand that\nthe space we intuit is infinite by a progressus ad infinitum\n(A510\u201311/B538\u201339), a progression of a series that we understand is\nnever complete (Onof and Schulting 2015). Accordingly, space itself,\nin this way given as infinite, is an object of intuition for us as the\nphenomenal horizon of finite regions of space from which we\ndistinguish it in the decomposing synthesis. A parallel account holds\nfor time. This account supplies the meaning, Rosefeldt argues, of\nKant\u2019s claim that \u201ca synthesis which does not belong to\nthe senses\u201d is required for \u201cspace and time [to be] first\ngiven to us as intuitions\u201d (B160\u20131n).\n\nAs Rosefeldt notes, the conclusion of the second step, the\napplicability of the categories to space and time, requires appeal to\na composing synthesis, since the decomposing synthesis precedes all\nconcepts, and only in the composing synthesis are the categories\ninvoked. Thus a transition from the decomposing to a composing\nsynthesis must be made. One possible strategy is to claim that a\ncomposing synthesis is not required for our representation of space as\nwhole, but only for our representations of determinate parts of space,\nas when we construct figures in geometry. But while the text of the\nB160\u20131 note does reference geometry, it also suggests (in the final\nsentence) that a composing synthesis is required for our\nrepresentation of space as a whole. Onof and Schulting (2015) argue\nthat it is our explicit representation of the unicity of space as a\nwhole that requires synthesis in accord with the categories, and they\nembellish their account by specifying precisely which categories are\nrequired for the various aspects of unicity (Allison 2015: 420\u201330\nprovides a complementary account). An alternative, suggested by\nRosefeldt (2022), is that first of all, the finite spatial parts that\nwe actually distinguish in decomposing synthesis, either of individual\nspatial parts or of various such parts taken as a group, feature a\nunity, representation of which must be accounted for by compositional\nsynthesis. But further, we are conscious of the fact that the infinite\nspace revealed as the phenomenal horizon in the decomposing synthesis\ncan be subdivided infinitely into finite spatial parts, all of which\nare represented as parts of that one all-encompassing infinite space.\nOur representation of the unity of all of this, which Rosefeldt calls\nworld-unity, must also be accounted for by a composing synthesis. From\nthis we can see that given that a composing synthesis accounts for the\nrepresented unity of the actual finite spaces we distinguish, it can\naccount for the represented world-unity as well. (For a discussion on\nhow a composing synthesis can operate on a target that is\nindeterminate in the way that world-unity is, see Daniel Sutherland\n2021, ch. 5, referenced in Rosefeldt 2022: 16 n.5).\n\nSince it has already been shown that composing syntheses generally\nmust feature the categories, the claim is that we can infer that the\ncategories structure our representation of space, and by parallel\nargument, our representation of time, and, moreover (in accord with\nKant\u2019s idealism), that they structure space and time themselves,\ntogether with the spatial and temporal features of objects in space\nand time. This allows us to see that the categories correctly apply to\nobjects in space and time, and to see that they do so from how they\nstructure our representations of space and time, and space and time\nthemselves. This would secure the generally agreed-upon objective of\nthe second step: to show how it is that the categories are related to\nobjects of intuition and thus of experience in such a way as to\ndemonstrate that they correctly apply to them.\n",
