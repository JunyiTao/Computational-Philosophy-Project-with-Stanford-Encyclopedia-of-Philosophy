Conceptual and Normative Argument on International Law\n\nRecent philosophy of international law has pursued a great variety of\nquestions. For present purposes, they can be broadly grouped into two\ncategories, although the boundaries between them are not sharp. First,\nthere are conceptual questions, such as whether international law is\ngenuinely an instance of \u201claw\u201d and, if it is, how it is\nrelated to the municipal legal orders associated with individual\nstates; there are also conceptual questions relating to key ideas\nemployed in international legal discourse, whether these be general\nideas such as \u201csovereignty\u201d, \u201cthe state\u201d, or\n\u201clegitimacy\u201d, or ideas associated with specific\ninternational legal sources or doctrines, such as \u201ccustomary\ninternational law\u201d, \u201cjus cogens\u201d, and\n\u201chuman rights\u201d. Such questions are discussed mainly in\nsections 2 and 3 of this entry.\n\nSecond, there are normative questions about the proper goals that\ninternational law\u2014or its domains, such as international human\nrights law, international environmental law, and international\ncriminal law\u2014should advance and the means by which it may\nproperly do so and, relatedly, how the legitimacy of international law\nis to be assessed. A recurring issue is the extent to which\nethical-political standards fashioned to assess domestic\nlaw\u2014such as democracy, the rule of law, and even legitimacy\nitself\u2014apply to international law (an important theme in the\nwork of Buchanan, e.g., Buchanan 2013). Due to the long period of\nphilosophical neglect of international law, we are still at an early\nstage in forming an adequate picture of the political morality\nappropriate to its distinctive nature and role. These questions are\nmostly discussed in sections 4, 5, and 6 of this entry.\n",
