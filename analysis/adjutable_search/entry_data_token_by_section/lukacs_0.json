    "main_text": "Life and Career\n1. Life and Career\n\nLuk\u00e1cs was born Bern\u00e1t Gy\u00f6rgy L\u00f6winger on\nApril 13, 1885, in Budapest. He received a Ph.D. in Political Science\nfrom the University of Kolozsv\u00e1r in 1906 and a doctorate from\nthe University of Budapest in 1909. In the following years,\nLuk\u00e1cs made a name for himself as a literary and aesthetic\ntheorist, working in Budapest, Berlin (where he was influenced by\nGeorg Simmel), Florence, and Heidelberg. In 1910 and 1911,\nLuk\u00e1cs published his essay collection Soul and Form\nand, together with Lajos F\u00fclep, founded the short-lived\navant-garde journal A Szellem (The Spirit).\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s world was sent into turmoil at that time by the\ndeath of his close friend Leo Popper and by the suicide of Irma\nSeidler, who had been his lover. He felt responsible for Seidler\u2019s\ndeath, and it proved to have an enormous impact on him, as reflected\nin his 1911 essay \u201cOn Poverty of Spirit.\u201d\n\nDuring the same period, Luk\u00e1cs developed a close connection\nwith Max and Marianne Weber in Heidelberg, with Ernst Bloch, and with\nthe Neo-Kantian philosophers Heinrich Rickert and Emil Lask. Between\n1912 and 1914 he worked on a first attempt to formulate a systematic\napproach to art, which remained unpublished during his lifetime\n(GW 16). In the First World War, Luk\u00e1cs was exempted\nfrom frontline military service. In 1914, he married the Russian\npolitical activist (and convicted terrorist) Jelena Grabenko.\n\nIn 1913, Luk\u00e1cs began participating in the influential\n\u201cSunday circle\u201d of Budapest intellectuals, which included\nKarl Mannheim. After returning from wartime service in the Hungarian\ncensor\u2019s office, he published The Theory of the Novel\n(1916). In 1917, despite Weber\u2019s support, he failed to receive a\nHabilitation (teaching qualification) at the University of Heidelberg.\nBetween 1916 and 1918, he also resumed his work on aesthetics, which\nresulted in the unpublished manuscript of the so-called\n\u201cHeidelberg Aesthetics\u201d (GW 17). To the surprise\nof many of his friends, Luk\u00e1cs joined the Hungarian Communist\nParty in 1918, although, as his essay on \u201cBolshevism as a Moral\nProblem\u201d attests, not without reservations.\n\nFollowing his rapid ascent as one of the leading thinkers of the\nCommunist Party, Luk\u00e1cs became more involved in day-to-day\npolitics. After the revolution in 1919, he first served as a deputy\ncommissar and then as commissar of public education in B\u00e9la Kun\u2019s\ngovernment. Later, when war broke out, he served as a political\ncommissar in the Hungarian Red Army (in which role he ordered the\nexecution of several soldiers; see Kadarkay 1991: 223). After the\ncommunist government was defeated, Luk\u00e1cs fled to Vienna at the\nend of 1919, where he married his second wife, Gertrud Bortstieber.\nCharged with coordinating the clandestine activities of the exiled\nCommunist Party, he remained under constant threat of expulsion to\nHungary.\n\nIn 1923, Luk\u00e1cs published his most famous work, the essay\ncollection History and Class Consciousness. In these essays,\nLuk\u00e1cs argues forcefully for a philosophically self-reflective\nversion of Marxism as a solution to the problems that vexed modern\nphilosophy, develops the idea of capitalist society as a\n\u201ctotality\u201d that is totally integrated as the value-form,\nsketches a distinctive Marxist epistemology, and identifies structural\nunfreedom (rather than exploitation or inequality) as the fundamental\nproblem of capitalism. In these essays, Luk\u00e1cs draws not only\non Marxist classics but also on sociological insights into the\ncharacter of modern societies that he acquired through Weber and\nSimmel. His reformulation of the philosophical premises of Marxism\nentails a rejection of the then contemporary forms of materialism and\nscientism endorsed by many Soviet party intellectuals. Unsurprisingly,\nthe party orthodoxy condemned the book as an expression of\nultra-leftism (in spite of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s pro-Leninist revisions to\nthe articles in the volume that had already appeared previously; see\nL\u00f6wy 1979: 172\u2013179).\n\nNevertheless, the book had a decisive influence on the early Frankfurt\nSchool. Luk\u00e1cs participated in the 1923 \u201cMarxist Work\nWeek,\u201d which laid the foundation for the founding of the\nInstitute for Social Research, and there is evidence that the major\ncritical theorists of the time were all deeply impressed by the\nreification essay in particular (Stahl 2018). Overall, History and\nClass Consciousness cemented Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s position as a\nleading scholar of Marxism, putting him at the forefront of the\ndebates of the time (an example being his quickly written study on\nLenin on the occasion of the Soviet leader\u2019s death in 1924). In\n1928, however, Luk\u00e1cs had to give up his political activities\nafter he presented the so-called \u201cBlum Theses\u201d (see 1928).\nIn this draft of a party platform for Hungary, which was named after\nhis party alias, he argued for a broad, democratic dictatorship of\nworkers and peasants. These theses were condemned as a right-wing\ndeviation by the party (which denounced him as both a left-wing and a\nright-wing dissident within a span of five years).\n\nFollowing another arrest by the Austrian authorities, Luk\u00e1cs\nleft Vienna in 1929, first for Berlin and then for Budapest, where he\nwent underground for three months. He was eventually summoned by the\nSoviet party leadership to Moscow, where he stayed from 1930 on,\nleaving only for Comintern missions in Berlin and for Tashkent during\nthe war. In Moscow, Luk\u00e1cs held a position at the Marx-Engels\nInstitute. During this time, he first came into contact with early\nworks by Marx that had previously remained\nunpublished. As Luk\u00e1cs became (at least outwardly) increasingly\nsubservient to the Stalinist orthodoxy, he publicly retracted the\nviews espoused in History and Class Consciousness (see\n1933b). The degree of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s agreement with Stalinism is\ndisputed to this day (see Lichtheim 1970; Deutscher 1972; Kolakowski\n1978; Pike 1988). However, it is clear from his writings that while he\npublicly defended Stalinist dogmas in both aesthetics and politics\nduring the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s (1933a, 1938, 1951), he later\nrepeatedly criticized Stalin and Stalinism (see 1957, 1962).\n\nIn 1944, Luk\u00e1cs returned to Budapest and became a professor at\nthe local university. In 1948, he published his two-volume study\nThe Young Hegel (written partly during the 1930s in Moscow).\nIn 1949, he also traveled to Paris to engage in a debate about\nexistentialism and Marxism with Sartre. The works of this period\nreflect both his allegiance to orthodox Soviet Marxism and his\nuneasiness with the Stalinist post-war situation. A widely criticized\nwriting from this time is The Destruction of Reason,\npublished in 1954. It denounced much of the German philosophical and\nliterary tradition after Marx as an outgrowth of\n\u201cirrationalism\u201d and as bearing responsibility for the\nascent of National Socialism. During this time, Luk\u00e1cs also\ncontinued to defend a conservative ideal of realism in aesthetics (see\n1951).\n\nAfter again being subjected to criticism from the party and virtually\nexcluded from public life in the mid-1950s, Luk\u00e1cs was able to\nembark on a new chapter following the Hungarian uprising against\nSoviet rule in 1956. Following Stalin\u2019s death, not only did it\nbecome increasingly possible for him to publicly criticize Stalinism\nand to again voice his vision of the future of Marxism (for the first\ntime since 1928), arguing that the Communist Party should regain\npublic trust by competing with other leftist forces within a\nmulti-party democracy, but he also served in the short-lived Nagy\ngovernment as minister for public education. After the subsequent\nSoviet invasion, he was arrested and imprisoned in Romania. Unlike\nother members of the government, he was not executed but merely\nexpelled from the Communist Party, which he did not rejoin until 1969.\nFrom the 1960s on, Luk\u00e1cs\u2014having had to retire from all\nacademic positions\u2014worked on his two-volume Specificity of\nthe Aesthetic and on a Marxist ethics that would later partly\nbecome the Ontology of Social Being, which remained\nunfinished in his lifetime. He also continued to publish extensively\non literature and art. Luk\u00e1cs passed away on June 4, 1971, in\nBudapest.\n",
