    "main_text": "Epistemology || Objects\n2.1 Objects\n2.1.1 Ontological framework\na. The scope of reality\n\nTibetan epistemologists are primarily Buddhist thinkers who follow the\nMadhyamaka views. A pertinent question for them is whether reliable\ncognitions bear on objects pertaining to conventional reality and/or\nultimate reality.\n\nWhile some authors seek to include knowledge of the ultimate within\nthe scope of reliable cognitions, the view of the majority is that\nreliable cognitions concern the conventional realm. A further debate\nis about whether reliable cognitions should be limited to what, in the\nconventional realm, is held to be real. The definition of an\nontological position in epistemological works thus concerns\nconventional reality; the ultimate is beyond the reach of reasoning.\nWhat Indian Buddhist epistemologists categorized as\n\u201cultimate\u201d and \u201cconventional\u201d is transposed\ninto the Madhyamaka framework of the Two Truths under the categories\nof \u201ccorrect conventional\u201d (yang dag pa\u02bci kun\nrdzob) and \u201cincorrect conventional\u201d (log\npa\u02bci kun rdzob), with varying repartitions of objects\nbetween the two according to the ontological model that is adopted.\n\n\nTibetan authors define their position\u2014in some cases a\nprovisional one adopted as a mere interpretative tool for dealing with\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s texts\u2014on the basis of models associated\nwith Indian Buddhist schools. A fourfold typology of philosophical\ntenets is set forth along two lines of distinction. The first\nseparates external-realist positions from idealist\n(Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da)ones; the second separates\nrepresentationalist positions from non-representationalist ones.\nExternal-realist models agree in positing the existence of\nextra-mental entities, but differ in their account of the way that a\ncognition of such objects takes place. According to the\nnon-representationalists (commonly associated with the views of the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika school), extra-mental entities exist\nsimultaneously to their cognition and are cognized directly by the\nlatter. According to the representationalists (associated with the\nSautr\u0101ntika school), extra-mental entities are the cause of their\ncognition but, being momentary, they have ceased to exist at the time\ncognition arises. \n\nEarly treatises attest to various choices among these models. For\ninstance, Chapa refutes the idealist and the Sautr\u0101ntika\nexternal-realist models and settles for a Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika-like\nposition, whereas Chumikpa Sengg\u00e9pel (Chu mig pa Seng ge\ndpal, 13th c.) opts for an idealist framework. Sakya\nPandita\u2019s position, shared by Gelukpa authors, is to arrange\nthese positions along a gradual ascending scale; the lowest, the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika model is refuted in favor of the adoption of the\nSautr\u0101ntika model, which is itself replaced by an idealist one on\na higher scale of analysis.\nb. The extension of the real\n\nWhile real particulars (what Dharmak\u012brti calls\n\u201csvalak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u201d), characterized by their\ncapacity to bring about an effect, are allotted conventional existence\n(extra-mental or exclusively mental, according to the model adopted),\nTibetan scholars are divided as to the spatial and temporal extensions\nof such particulars.\n\nThe spatial options range from an infinitesimal particle (the atom\nbeing considered the smallest size unit) to a macroscopic object up to\na commonsense object; the temporal ones from a momentary entity to a\ncontinuum of indeterminate (although not infinite) duration. The\nadoption of extended objects is subject to the criticism brought\nforward by Dharmak\u012brti against Indian philosophers who admit\nwholes as distinct from their parts, and would, in a general way,\nconflict with the Buddhist idea that compounds only have nominal\nexistence. On the other hand, the infinitesimalist view has\ndifficulties to account for the fact that macroscopic objects appear\nto our cognition rather than individual atoms. The latter difficulty\nleads, in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s works, to the refutation of\nextra-mental reality in favor of an idealist position. An intermediate\nview is to grant reality to objects that have some spatial extension:\nnot commonsense objects, but aggregations of atoms within the scope of\na specific sense-sphere (Skt. \u0101yatana, Tib. skye\nmched), such as, for the visual sense-sphere, patches of\ncolor.\n\nRegarding the temporal extension of real particulars, momentary\nentities pose a challenge to transactional usage: once known, they\nhave already ceased and hence cannot be used nor acted upon.\nTransactional usage is better grounded in objects that have some\nduration. Continua, however, bring about the same critique as\nmacroscopic objects: what really exists is a particular at each\nmoment, but the chain of causally related moments, even though it may\nappear to the ignorant mind as an object having duration, only exists\nnominally. A limited temporal extension is not an option, for, in\ndifference to aggregated atoms, the different moments in a series do\nnot co-exist\u2014only the present one exists and is causally\nefficient; they hence cannot be considered to contribute collectively\nto the cognition of an object.\n\nFew Tibetan authors, among them Taktsang Lotsawa Sh\u00e9rap Rinchen\n(sTag tshang Lo ts\u0101 ba Shes rab rin chen, b. 1405),\nadopt the infinitesimal-momentary view. The intermediate view is\nprescribed by Sakya Pandita and adopted, for instance, by Lowokenchen\nS\u00f6nam L\u00fcndrup (Glo bo mkhan chen bSod nams lhun\ngrub, 1456\u20131532), while Gelukpa authors and some Sakyapa\nones such as Ngawang Ch\u00f6drak (Ngag dbang chos grags,\n1572\u20131641) extend their view of reality to commonsense objects\nand continua, which are held to possess their own causal capacity.\nThey are described as collections, but distinguished from the partless\nwholes distinct from their parts advocated by the more extreme realist\nIndian philosophers who are the target of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\ncriticism.\n2.1.2 Typologies\n\nObjects (Tib. yul) are primarily considered as cognitive\nobjects, in relation to cognitive episodes (Tib. blo). In the\ncommon vocabulary of Tibetan epistemology, several sorts of objects\nare distinguished:\n\nthe \u201cappearing object\u201d (snang yul)\nthe \u201capprehended object\u201d or \u201cgrasped\nobject\u201d (gzung yul)\nthe \u201cintentional object\u201d or \u201cconceived\nobject\u201d (zhen yul)\nthe \u201cengaged object\u201d or \u201cobject of\napplication\u201d (\u02bcjug yul)\n\n\nWhile the terminology, which reflects different kinds of mental\noperations, is shared among Tibetan epistemologists, they disagree as\nto the definition of each sort and as to the equivalence of some of\nthem, in particular of the appearing object and the apprehended\nobject.\na. The appearing and apprehended objects\n\nRegarding the appearing object and the apprehended object, a major\ncause of dissension lies in the model adopted to account for the\nprocess of a cognition of an object. Two options are in competition in\nthe external-realist model: (i) direct realism (associated with the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika model) advocates a direct contact with reality;\nin this model the object and its cognition exist simultaneously,\nalbeit distinctly; (ii) a causal theory (associated with the\nSautr\u0101ntika model) according to which an object acts as a cause\nfor the emergence of its cognition but, being momentary, has ceased to\nexist once this cognition arises.\n\n(i) For an adherent of the first model such as Chapa, the appearing\nobject, the object that manifests itself in cognition, and the\napprehended object, what cognition apprehends, are one and the same\nthing (\u201cappearing object\u201d does not even figure as a\ndistinct category of cognitive object). \u201cAppearing\u201d\n(snang ba) is held to be a mental operation shared by all\ntypes of cognition. As such, each cognition is held to have its\napprehended object, and a threefold typology of awareness is\nestablished on the basis of three sorts of apprehended objects, which\nare exhaustive of what can appear in cognition:\n\nparticulars (mental or extra-mental)\nhallucinations/illusions (i.e., something that appears to a\nnon-conceptual cognition while being nonexistent)\nconcepts (don spyi)\n\n\nThese three are distinguished and paired with three sorts of mental\nepisodes by relying on two corresponding sets of criteria:\n\nThe characteristic of existence (associated with the notion of\ncausal efficacy) separates particulars (real entities) on the one hand\nand concepts and hallucinated objects on the other; it matches the\nidentification of the corresponding mental episodes as\n\u201cnon-erroneous\u201d and \u201cerroneous\u201d respectively.\nHere, the notion \u201cerroneous\u201d (\u02bckhrul pa)\nconveys a specific type of error, distinct from a mistaken\ndetermination (such as identifying a rope as a snake, or identifying\nsomething impermanent as permanent), an error which is simply due to\nthe object not being real.\n The characteristic of vividness, associated with that of\nspecificity, separates real entities and hallucinated objects from\nconcepts, and is the ground for the distinction between non-conceptual\nand conceptual mental episodes.\n\n\nThe correspondence plays out as follows:\n\n\n\nobject\ncognition \n\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(a)\n(b)\n \n\nparticular\nvividly appearing;\n\nspecific\ncausally efficient\nnon-conceptual\nnon-erroneous\nperception \n\nhallucinated\u00a0object\nvividly appearing;\n\nspecific\nnot causally efficient\nnon-conceptual\nerroneous\npseudo-perception,\n\ne.g., dream or hallucination \n\nconcept\nnot vividly appearing;\n\nnot specific\nnot causally efficient\nconceptual\nerroneous \nany conceptual cognition \n\n\nThe kind of awareness depends on the kind of object that it\napprehends. Mental episodes may be phenomenologically\nindistinguishable but still be of different types because their object\nis different. For instance, the perception of a fire (a non-conceptual\nnon-erroneous cognition) and the hallucination of a fire (a\nnon-conceptual erroneous cognition) are of different types, because\nthe object of the first is a particular and the object of the second\nis not. As such, Chapa can be said to endorse a form of experiential\nand phenomenal disjunctivism, and an externalist account of cognition.\n\n\n(ii) The premise that every cognition has its apprehended object does\nnot hold for an adherent of the causal model such as Sakya Pandita: a\nmental episode for the arising of which no real entity acted as a\ndirect cause must be held to have, strictly speaking, no object, or at\nleast, no \u201capprehended object\u201d (gzung yul). In\nother words, only non-conceptual non-erroneous cognitions (namely,\nperceptions) have a grasped object.\n\nThe causation-model further has the consequence that the apprehended\nobject cannot be identical with the appearing object: the apprehended\nobject has ceased at the time of the arising of its effect, a\ncognition in which an object manifests itself. Additionally, Sakya\nPandita understands \u201cappearance\u201d in the restricted sense\nof the mode of operation proper to non-conceptual cognitions. There\ncan be no \u201cappearance\u201d in the case of a conceptual\ncognition, for the latter does not apply to reality by way of an\nappearance reflecting real objects, but by way of exclusion, namely by\ndeterminations that consist in eliminations of the opposite. Thus,\naccording to Sakya Pandita, the distinction between non-conceptual and\nconceptual amounts to a difference in the mode of operation of the\nrespective cognitions, namely, via appearance (or vivid appearance)\nfor the first, via exclusion for the second, while the distinction\nbetween non-erroneous and erroneous relies on the existence of an\napprehended object, understood as a real object causing this\ncognition.\n\nAdherents of the direct realist model are thus criticized by those of\nthe causation model for admitting improper, non-existent apprehended\nobjects (namely, the concept and the hallucinated object), and for\nblurring the difference between the respective modes of operation of\nnon-conceptual and conceptual cognitions. In return, the causation\nmodel is criticized in that it does not enable direct access to real\nobjects; those can, at best, be inferred.\n\nAlthough later Gelukpa authors, who take causality and the time-gap\nproblem it involves seriously, adopt the causation model, they mostly\npreserve Chapa\u2019s typology, together with the identification of\napprehended object and appearing object. This leaves them in a\ndifficult situation as they adopt a typology of objects that precisely\navoids a model in which the object grasped by cognition would be\ndifferent from the object that appears to it. Their solution is to\ninvoke the notion of \u201caspect\u201d: a cognition caused by an\nobject takes a form similar to its cause. This aspectualism differs\nfrom a representationalist view in that it does not involve, strictly\nspeaking, a representation which would stand as a curtain between\ncognition and the object. Cognition still cognizes its object directly\nby taking its aspect.\nb. The intentional object\n\nWhile \u201cappearance\u201d is passive, the \u201cintentional\nobject\u201d is associated with an intentional operation of\ndetermination (zhen pa) that involves the (involuntary)\nblurring of the distinction between the mental appearance and an\nextra-mental particular by way of an unconscious error inherent to the\nthought process of ordinary beings. Such operation is restricted to\nconceptual cognitions, and is what allows action based on concepts,\ninsofar as via intentional determination the concept is conceived as\nhaving the nature of something external.\nc. The engaged object\n\nThe \u201cengaged object\u201d is usually identified with the object\nof reliable cognition, and hence understood differently according to\nthe definition of reliable cognition adopted by each author. In some\nversions, the \u201cengaged object\u201d stands out as a real,\nextra-mental particular considered to be the object that is likely to\nbe acted upon at the outcome of a reliable cognition (for instance, a\nfire when perceiving a fire or when inferring that there is a fire on\na mountain pass as one perceives smoke on a mountain pass). According\nto other authors, such as Chapa, the engaged object is the\n\u201cobject with regard to which opposite superimpositions have been\neliminated,\u201d without reference to any transactional\n\u201capplication.\u201d\n\nOne can identify, at the source of this typology of objects of\ncognition, the need to specify the scope of reliability for reliable\ncognitions, in view of problematic cases\u2014an issue already dealt\nwith by the Indian epistemologist Dharmottara. One such case is that\nof inference, which qualifies as a reliable cognition, but is strictly\nspeaking \u201cerroneous\u201d due to its conceptual nature. Namely,\nthe thought-content of an inferential cognition is a universal, which\nbears no correspondence whatsoever with extra-mental reality.\nDistinguishing between different types of objects allows making sense\nof this by considering inference to be erroneous with regard to its\napprehended object (for those that admit that it has one), or just\nerroneous qua conceptual cognition (for those who do not admit that it\nhas an apprehended object), but reliable with regard to its engaged\nobject, a real particular. \n",
