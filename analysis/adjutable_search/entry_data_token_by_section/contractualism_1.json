How does contractualism differ from other social contract theories? \n\nContractualism appeals to the idea of a social contract. It attempts\nto derive the content of morality (and, in some versions, also the\njustification for holding that we are obligated to follow morality)\nfrom the notion of an agreement between all those in the moral domain.\nContemporary moral philosophy offers several other interpretations of\nthe social contract tradition. It is useful to distinguish\ncontractualism from these alternatives.\n\nContractarianism has its roots in Hobbes, whose account is\nbased on mutual self-interest. Morality consists in those forms of\ncooperative behaviour that it is mutually advantageous for\nself-interested agents to engage in. (The most prominent modern\nexponent is David Gauthier. See Gauthier 1986.)\n\nBy contrast, any form of contractualism is grounded on the\nequal moral status of persons. It interprets this moral status as\nbased on their capacity for rational autonomous agency. According to\ncontractualism, morality consists in what would result if we were to\nmake binding agreements from a point of view that respects our equal\nmoral importance as rational autonomous agents. Contractualism has its\nroots in Rousseau, rather than Hobbes: the general will is what we\nwould jointly will if we adopted the perspective of free and equal\ncitizens. Contractualism offers an alternative to contractarianism.\nUnder contractarianism, I seek to maximise my own interests in a\nbargain with others. Under contractualism, I seek to pursue my\ninterests in a way that I can justify to others who have their own\ninterests to pursue.\n\nWe next distinguish contractualism from the specific moral theory of\nKant. Kantian moral philosophers seek principles to which all rational\nagents would agree, under certain idealised conditions. In order to\nreach such an agreement, Kant notoriously needs to abstract away from\nmany (some would say too many) concrete features of our moral lives.\n(See Onora O\u2019Neill\u2019s gloss on the notion of agreement in\nKantian ethics; O\u2019Neill 2003.)\n\nContractualism departs from Kant in various respects. In particular,\nit offers a substantive account of the normative force of morality,\nbased on the value of a relation of mutual respect. Reasonableness is\nnot taken to be something that can be demonstrated outside the moral\npoint of view. Another difference is that contractualism seeks\nprinciples that no one can reasonably reject, rather than principles\nall would agree to.\n\nHowever, Scanlon\u2019s contractualism has Kantian elements, as it\nseeks a free agreement that elucidates both freedom and equality. We\nmight say that contractualism gives expression to ideas latent in\nKant\u2019s discussions of the Categorical Imperative (especially in\nthe Formula of Humanity and the Formula of the Kingdom of Ends, rather\nthan the more familiar Formula of Universal Law). Indeed, as we shall\nsee in\n section 5,\n Derek Parfit argues that, despite their differences, contractualism\ndoes coincide with the best interpretation of Kant\u2019s moral\ntheory.\n\nThe most influential recent social contract theorist is John Rawls.\nRawls\u2019s contract differs from Scanlonian contractualism in two\nkey ways. (1) Rawls\u2019s contract is more Kantian, as he seeks\nprinciples everyone would agree to, rather than principles\nno-one could reasonably reject. (This contrast is especially\nmarked if we consider Rawls\u2019s Dewey Lectures (Rawls 1980), where\nhis work is at its most Kantian.) (2) Rawls\u2019s contract is\npolitical\u2014it aims to set the general social framework for a\nliberal society, rather than determining moral principles. As a\nresult, Rawls places the parties to his agreement behind a veil of\nignorance, where they do not know many key facts about their own\nidentity. This is to ensure that the resulting principles of justice\nembody Rawls\u2019s commitment to liberal neutrality. For Rawls, we\nought to follow the principles that it would be rational for everyone\nto choose, if they had to choose those principles without knowing\nanything about themselves or their circumstances. Because each person\nknows that they could end up being anyone, each must have concern for\nall. In essence, Rawls uses self-interest behind a veil of ignorance\nto represent a commitment to justice, construed as fairness to\nall.\n\nContractualism, by contrast, invokes no veil of ignorance. I know my\nown circumstances. It is not self-interest combined with ignorance of\nself that makes me take account of everyone\u2019s interests, but\nrather my concern to justify myself to everyone else. This motivation\nis a key feature of Scanlon\u2019s contractualism. All social\ncontract theorists\u2014even contractarians\u2014agree that agents\nwant to justify themselves to others. However, for the contractarian,\nsuch a desire is merely strategic\u2014justification is\ninstrumentally useful because it enables me to get others to do what\nserves my interests. For the contractualist, by contrast, agents are\nmorally motivated by an intrinsic desire to justify themselves to\nothers. Having this desire is part of what it is to be a\nmoral agent.\n\nDespite these differences, contractualism does have several points in\ncommon with other social contract theories. In particular,\ncontractualism aspires to provide a non-utilitarian theory that\ngrounds moral status on a universal trait of persons\u2014rational\nmoral agency\u2014and thus provides general principles whose scope is\nglobal. It is to this contrast with utilitarianism that we now turn.\n\n",
