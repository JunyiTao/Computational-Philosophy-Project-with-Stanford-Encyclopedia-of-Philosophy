    "main_text": "Feminist Reconstructions of Transcendence || Projecting a Feminine Divine\n4.2 Projecting a Feminine Divine\n\nA distinct alternative to the above appears in the feminist\nphilosophies of religion of Luce Irigaray and Mary Daly. Both seek to\nproject a \u201cfemale divine\u201d that would be fully immanental\nin and for the female Self (capitalized by Daly) and would provide\nwhat Irigaray calls a \u201csensible transcendental\u201d. The\ndifferent rhetorical strategies and cultural contexts of these two\ngynocentric philosophers sometimes conceal the similarity of their\nphilosophies of religion. Both argue that the Father God is an\nidealized projection of masculine identity and that the process of\nwomen\u2019s becoming divine is imperative. For Daly, the \u201cdivine\nspark\u201d within the female Self is the ontological ballast needed\nby the feminist movement; similarly for Irigaray, the creation of a\n\u201cfemale divine\u201d is a condition of female subjectivity.\nBoth Daly and Irigaray urge nothing less than an overturning of the\nsymbolic order and of language itself. Both are first and foremost\nphilosophers of the passions, seeking to encompass the elements of\nearth, air, fire, and water within their visions. Each in her own way\nhas helped to forge a radical feminist consensus that spirituality is\nto be exalted above doctrine, and that patriarchal conceptions of God\nas any kind of objective reality must be deconstructed so that female\nsubjectivity might become more expansive and free. Both reject\nreformist moves in the philosophy of religion as remaining inscribed\nwithin a phallocentric economy that evokes a god whose self-giving\nlove is only accessible through fathers and sons and their\nrepresentatives. In theorizing religion, both adopt a projection\ntheory, classically rooted in Feuerbach\u2019s claim that \u201ctheology\nis anthropology\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d a projection made in the\nimage of \u201cman\u201d. However, far from relegating religion to\nthe category of illusion, each issues an invitation to \u201cmake\nbelieve\u201d.\n4.2.1 In the American Context\n\nThe early Daly carved out a philosophy of religion largely consonant\nwith the position cited in 4.1 above, as found in her Beyond God\nthe Father: Towards a Philosophy of Women\u2019s Liberation (1973\n[1985]). Ultimate reality is conceptualized not only as Verb,\nexpressed in the present participle \u201cBe-ing\u201d, but as an\n\u201cintransitive Verb\u201d in which all being participates (Daly\n1973 [1985]: 34; 1978: 23; 1984: 423). In these terms, Daly provides an\nontological analysis of the urge toward transcendence, or\nparticipation in be-ing. Here the urge to transcendence is raised to\nthe cosmic scale, and the vision of peace, justice, and ecological\nharmony that Daly projects bears a close resemblance to prophetic\nbiblical texts. \u201cQuintessence\u201d expresses another metaphor\nfor the be-ing in which we live, love, create, are. Daly says that\nQuintessence \n\n\nis that which has been drawn on in my writing and searching. The quest\nfor Quintessence is the most Desperate response I know to the call of\nthe Wild. It means throwing one\u2019s life as far as it will go. (1998: 4)\n\n\n\nShe analyzes Quintessence as the highest essence, above the four\nelements of fire, air, water, and earth; it is what permeates all\nnature, the Spirit that gives life and vitality to the whole universe.\nAlthough it can be blocked or partly destroyed by violence and\npornography, poverty, racism, medical and scientific exploitation, and\nthe threat of ecological and nuclear destruction, its apparent\ninvincibility imparts an important measure of transcendence.\n\nThe later Daly\u2019s trilogy developed a modified, more immanent, theory\nof the divine, beginning with Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of\nRadical Feminism (1978), and continuing through Pure Lust:\nElemental Feminist Philosophy (1984) and most of\nQuintessence\u2014Realizing the Archaic Future (1998). Here\nthe dialectic shifts subtly from the earlier balance maintained\nbetween immanence and transcendence, and tips in favor of a divine\nthat is purely immanent within the female Self. Rather than being the\ndivine milieu within which the self lives, the divine is only alive\nwithin the self. In GynEcology the emphasis is on the power\n\u201cto spin\u201d meaning out of women\u2019s own divine orbs and to\nfind the power of being within one\u2019s self. By the time of Pure\nLust, Daly has further modified the \u201cpower of being\u201d\nto the pluralized \u201cPowers of Be-ing\u201d, a move that resolves\nthe problem of the one and the many in favor of the many. Given Daly\u2019s\nseparatist ideology, the \u201cdivine\u201d in question can only be\nwholly incarnate in the \u201cmany\u201d female divine Selves. The\ngynocentric emphasis of Daly\u2019s later writings will open her to the\nsame critical questions posed about Irigaray\u2019s woman-centered\nwritings. Can they do justice to differences that figure in\ndiscussions of race, class, ethnic origins, and so forth? Do they\nreinstall sexual difference with old stereotypes left intact, trapping\nwomen once more within the parameters of their sexuality and\nphysicality? Have they romanticized difference rather than theorizing\nit?\n\nDaly\u2019s intent was to create a trans-cultural, i.e., metapatriarchal,\nmyth, but her thinking was deeply indebted to one particular strain in\nthe Western intellectual tradition. Using the words of the Marxist\nErnst Bloch, one could call this strain \u201crevolutionary\nPrometheanism\u201d  (Block 1956\u20131959 [1986] passim). It\ngoes back at least as far as the Stoic logos spermatikos, the\n\u201cseed\u201d that links every person with the divine reason. It\nis closely connected with the medieval mystic\u2019s talk of a\n\u201cscintilla animae\u201d, the \u201cspark of the\nsoul\u201d, frequently echoed in Daly\u2019s books (e.g., 1978: 183:\n\u201cthe divine spark of be-ing in women\u201d). Meister Eckhart\ncould write: \n\n\nI have said that at times there is a power in the soul which alone is\nfree\u2026. It is free from all names, and altogether unimpeded,\nuntrammelled, and free from all modes, as God is free and untrammelled\nin Himself. (c. 1300 [1957: 137 as quoted in Pietsch 1979]) \n\n\nFor the radical medieval mystic like Eckhart the knowledge revealed in\nthe experience of this divine spark is utterly self-authenticating.\nTherefore, it need not be subjected to the judgment of an\ninstitutional church. So too Daly writes: \u201cshe knows that only\nshe can judge her self\u201d (1978: 378). Also important in this\nstrain of thought is the theme of the dispossession/repossession of\nthe true, divine self. It is a powerful theme in Hegel (who was\ninfluenced by medieval mysticism) and in Feuerbach, and it also\npervades Daly\u2019s philosophy of religion. Hegel decries human beings who\nlet themselves be \u201crobbed of freedom, their spirit, their\neternal and absolute element\u201d (1795 [1948: 162]) and who then\ntake \u201cflight to deity\u201d (1795 [1948: 163]). He insists that\nnow (ca. 1800) is the time for persons to \u201crepossess the\ntreasures formerly squandered on heaven\u201d (1795 [1948: 159]).\nFeuerbach takes up this same motif and makes it the dominant theme of\nhis whole critique of religion.  Daly refers to \u201cStolen female\nenergy\u201d (1978: 367), to \u201cour stolen original\ndivinity\u201d (1978: 41) and urges repossession. She does not say\nwhat this leaves for men, who have been living off women, the\n\u201cgenerators of energy\u201d (1978: 319).  Finally, along with\nFeuerbach, Daly says simply \u201cwe are divinity\u201d.\n\nDaly\u2019s philosophy of religion was plugged into the Promethean myth,\nbut she also added an original contribution. She explicitly expanded\nit to include women. Then she performed a reversal, and restricted it\nto women\u2014although this reversal, too, has deep roots in the\nWestern tradition, specifically, Iranian and biblical apocalypticism.\nDaly conveys the impression that only a few women are able to\nundertake the \u201cJourney\u201d (1978) or to achieve\n\u201cQuintessence\u201d (1998). This is not because she was\npessimistic about the female Self, which has \u201cimmeasurable\nunique potentialities\u201d (1978: 382), but because she was acutely\nsensitive to the power of evil, that is, to the power of the male\npatriarchy to successfully co-opt women. At the same time, Daly could\nbe rapturously optimistic about those women who do escape male power\nand begin to search and spin. These will find the \u201creal\nsource\u201d, the \u201cdeep Background\u201d, the \u201cpower of\nthe self\u2019s be-ing\u201d, \u201cthe Wild Self\u201d, and spin into a\n\u201cnew time/space\u201d, a \u201cnew creation\u201d, and will\nglimpse a \u201cParadise that is beyond the boundaries of patriarchal\nparadise\u201d (1978: 13, 24, 49, 283, 423).\n4.2.2 In the Continental Context\n\nMore than Daly, Luce Irigaray\u2019s writings have proved to be a\nprovocative stimulus for a number of feminist philosophers of religion\n(Anderson 1998; Deutscher 1994, 1997; Hollywood 1994, 1998; Jantzen 1999). Both a philosopher\nand a psychoanalyst, Irigaray aims to recuperate the repressed\nfeminine. Her chief themes are (1) the \u201csensible\ntranscendental\u201d, which performs a similar function as Derrida\u2019s\n\u201cfinite infinite\u201d, (2) sexual difference as paradigmatic\nof difference in itself, and (3) divinity and spirituality as\nsignificant feminist requirements to ground female subjectivity.\nIrigaray conceptualises the female divine as a \u201csensible\ntranscendental\u201d that is both flesh and word (Irigaray 1984\n[1993a: 115, 129]). Reversing traditional incarnational doctrine, she\nspeaks of flesh made word instead of word made flesh. \n\n\nBut if the Word was made flesh in this way, and to this extent, it can\nonly have been to make me (become) God in my jouissance, which can at\nlast be recognized. (1977 [1985: 199\u2013200])\n\n\nPerhaps the best way to read Irigaray\u2019s notion of the \u201csensible\ntranscendental\u201d is in terms of Mary Daly\u2019s description of her\nown project: \u201cThe philosophy here unfolded\u201d, Daly\nexplained, \u201cis material/physical as well as spiritual,\nmending/transcending this deceptive dichotomy\u201d (1984: 7).\nImagining both sexual difference and divine otherness, Irigaray coins\nthe sensible transcendental to overcome the split between\ntranscendence (mind or spirit) and sensibility (body). Unlike Daly,\nhowever, Irigaray argues that a spiritual relationship between women\nand men, understood as progressive energy transmission, can enable a\nharmonization of the human and divine dimensions separated under\npatriarchal distortions. A love that welcomes difference will be\ncapable of recognizing the other as transcendent to the self. Each\npartner will be allowed access to her or his own divinization.\n\nIn \u201cDivine Women\u201d (1993b [first published 1987]) and\n\u201cBelief Itself\u201d (1993b [first presented 1980]) Irigaray\u2019s\napproach to the topic of divinity is profoundly immanentalizing,\ncompared to traditional theology and philosophy of religion, even as\nher interest appears concentrated on the meaning of (women\u2019s)\ntranscendence. Her reconstruction requires two dialectical movements.\nFirst, she must nullify the radical alterity of the Wholly Other God,\narguing that this is a god produced by and for the masculine imaginary\nand therefore not suitable to women\u2019s becoming. Second, she must\nelevate \u201cwoman\u201d to the status of the divine, negating\nSimone de Beauvoir\u2019s view that woman remains always within the\ndimension of immanence, incapable of transcendence. Mediated by a\n\u201cgod of her sex\u201d, woman\u2019s becoming (divine) is thus\npossible, and in turn makes possible for the first time an ethics that\ndefines a genuine relationship between two subjects, male and female,\nwho do not simply differ, but differ differently. In the final\nanalysis, by \u201cthe divine\u201d Irigaray means \u201csexual\ndifference\u201d itself, that is, a new form of ethical relationship\nthat can exist between women and men, or, by extension, between women\nand any others, once women have attained their own subjectivity.\n\nShorn of his anthropocentrism, Irigaray\u2019s philosophy of religion\nrecalls the twofold ambition of Feuerbach\u2019s philosophy of religion in\n1841: to elevate \u201cman\u201d to the level of \u201cGod\u201d\nin order to display the true essence of the species-being; and to\ndissolve \u201cGod\u201d into the human essence more unequivocally\nthan Hegel, who did not fully anthropologize the divine. Her relation\nto Feuerbach (and Hegel) is apparent in her account of the sensible\ntranscendental as marking the fundamental materiality of spirit.\nDebates concerning Irigaray\u2019s possible \u201cessentialism\u201d and\n\u201cutopianism\u201d also recall Marx\u2019s critique of Feuerbach\u2019s\n\u201cspecies-being\u201d, and repeated charges of the utopian\nquality of Marx\u2019s own idea of unalienated humanity. Some feminists\nrebut the utopian charge by finding in Irigaray\u2019s reflections on the\nelement of air in the work of Heidegger a tangible example of\nmateriality that transcends the limitations of embodiment without\nbeing any less material (Armour 2003). Others read Irigaray\u2019s notion\nof a sensible transcendental as relying too heavily on western models\nof autonomy and self-determination (M. Keller 2003). Recently,\nIrigaray\u2019s explorations of the meaning of spirit/breath as the\nelemental force of life have put her in touch with eastern religious\ntraditions such as Hinduism (Irigaray 1999 [2002]).\n\nA major question some feminists have raised about the \u201cfeminine\ndivine\u201d is whether the language of transcendence can be retained\nplausibly as a poetic probe when the object of belief is assumed to be\nunreal. Amy Hollywood\u2019s analysis discloses why acceptance of a\nFeuerbachian projection theory of religion, in which God is the\nprojection of human wishes, attributes, and desires, complicates any\neffort to construct a new \u201cfeminine divine\u201d. Belief works,\nHollywood says, only as long as the underlying dynamics that fund it\nremain hidden. \n\n\nWhat Irigaray appears to forget is Feuerbach\u2019s central claim (and the\ngrounds for his hope that the hold of religion might be broken): for\nreligious projection to function, its mechanism must be hidden so that\nits object might inspire belief. (Hollywood 1994: 175) \n\n\nIrigaray recognizes that the \u201cexposure\u201d of this mechanism\nhas not destroyed religion for many, and hence asserts the importance\nof adequate projections. But how is such projection possible or\nmeaningful for those, like Irigaray herself, who assume that the\nobject of belief is unreal? If Irigaray maintains a Feuerbachian human\nreferent for her own projection of religious discourse in terms of\nfemale representations of the divine, the feminine divine, too, would\nseem to facilitate its own destruction. What possibilities does this\nleave for female transcendence? Can belief be simultaneously posited\nand deconstructed? Can the strong female subjectivity created\nin and by a mystic such as Teresa of Avila become available to women\nwithout Teresa\u2019s acceptance of a transcendent Other who is\nthe divine (Hollywood 1994: 176)? Because transcendence for Irigaray\nis associated with the \u201cmale\u201d and a sacrificial economy,\nit is not clear how women are expected to claim the new subjectivity\nthat she thinks religion, reconstituted, can offer. It may be the case\nthat Irigaray herself is ambivalent about belief and transcendence,\nand this leads her \u201cimmediately to deconstruct the very deities\nshe invokes\u201d (1994: 176). It may further be the case that the\ngynocentric project in philosophy of religion creates distinctive\ntensions, leading even sympathetic critics to inquire \n\n\nhow far the immanent can be re-inscribed as the site of transcendence\nwithout returning to the logic of sacrifice and bodily suffering\nseemingly endemic to the incarnational theologies of Christianity.\n(Hollywood 1994: 177) \n\n\nThere is also the related question as to \u201cwhether belief can be\nmimed without re-inscribing women into a logic of the same such as\nthat which Irigaray sees underlying Christianity\u201d (Hollywood\n1994: 177).\n\nIrigaray can be interpreted as striving to create a religious language\nthat leads neither to theism nor to atheism but rather to a dialectic\nof immanence and transcendence that does not in any way assume an\n\u201cobject of belief\u201d along hierarchical lines of verticality\n(see Hollywood 2002: chap. 7). In comparison to traditional\ntheological accounts of such a dialectic, however, the emphasis of\nIrigaray\u2019s philosophy of religion is oriented to affirming immanence,\nrather than to escaping finitude, embodiment, and materiality. The\ndivine is to be found in the space between two (human) beings who\nencounter each other face to face in the recognition of sexual\ndifference. Transcendence for women hinges on the possibility of this\nradical, and relational, immanentizing of the meaning of divinity.\n",
