    "main_text": "Premises and Conclusions\n5. One or Many?\n\nWe have touched only on a few central aspects of the notion of logical\nconsequence, leaving further issues, debates and, in particular,\ndetails to emerge from particular accounts (accounts that are\nwell-represented in this encyclopedia). But even a quick glance at the\nrelated links section (below) will attest to a fairly large\nnumber of different logical theories, different accounts of what\n(logically) follows from what. And that observation raises a question\nwith which we will close: Is there one notion of logical consequence\nthat is the target of all such theories, or are there many?\n\nWe all agree that there are many different formal techniques for\nstudying logical consequence, and very many different formal systems\nthat each propose different relations of logical consequence. But\ngiven a particular argument, is the question as to whether it is\ndeductively valid an all-or-nothing affair? The orthodoxy, logical\nmonism, answers affirmatively. There is one relation of\ndeductive consequence, and different formal systems do a better or\nworse job of modelling that relation. (See, for example, Priest 1999\nfor a defence of monism.) The logical contextualist or\nrelativist says that the validity of an argument depends on\nthe subject matter or the frame of reference or some other context of\nevaluation. (For example, a use of the law of the excluded middle\nmight be valid in a classical mathematics textbook, but not in an\nintuitionistic mathematics textbook, or in a context where we reason\nabout fiction or vague matters.) The logical pluralist, on\nthe other hand, says that of one and the same argument, in one and the\nsame context, there are sometimes different things one should say with\nrespect to its validity. For example, perhaps one ought say that the\nargument from a contradictory collection of premises to an unrelated\nconclusion is valid in the sense that in virtue of its form\nit is not the case that the premises are true an the conclusion untrue\n(so it is valid in one precise sense) but that nonetheless, in another\nsense the form of the argument does not ensure that the truth of the\npremises leads to the truth of the conclusion. The monist or\nthe contextualist holds that in the case of the one argument a single\nanswer must be found for the question of its validity. The pluralist\ndenies this. The pluralist holds that the notion of logical\nconsequence itself may be made more precise in more than one way, just\nas the original idea of a \u201cgood argument\u201d bifurcates into\ndeductive and inductive validity (see Beall and Restall 2000 for a\ndefence of pluralism).\n",
