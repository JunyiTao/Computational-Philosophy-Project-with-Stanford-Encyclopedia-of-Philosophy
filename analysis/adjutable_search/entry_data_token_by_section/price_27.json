    "main_text": "Recognition || Sign-cognition, Meaning, and Symbolisation\n5.5 Sign-cognition, Meaning, and Symbolisation\n\nPrice (especially 1953a: 144ff, 160ff) also made significant\ncontributions to theorising about meaning.\n\nFirst, he (1953a: 144ff) draws a distinction between two senses of\n\u201cmeaning\u201d: (i) the \u201csign\u201d sense and (ii) the\n\u201csymbol\u201d sense. The first is the sense in which we say\nthat those clouds mean rain, and the second the sense in which the\nword \u201crain\u201d means rain (see also 1938: 444). See also\nGrice 1957 and\n \u00a77\n below.\n\nSecond, he criticises (1953a: 160ff) the view that symbols are a\nspecial sort of sign (Ogden & Richards 1923: 23; Stebbing 1930:\n11), the \u201cSign-Theory of Symbolization\u201d. The natural link\nbetween sign and signified is established inductively. However, one\nmight indicate that one wants a drink by mimicking drinking with\none\u2019s hand. According to Price, this works by resemblance, not\nby establishing an inductive correlation to wanting a drink, and thus\nis unlike the natural, inductively established way that black clouds\nsignify rain\u2014not all symbols are signs.\n\nThird, Price\u2019s general objection to the sign-theory of meaning\nis that it has latched onto something that corresponds to what a\nspectator of a linguistic act, or an interpreter, must engage with,\nbut it completely ignores the point of view of the speaker (or\nwriter). It focuses, as he says, on the consumer and not the producer\nof language (1953a: 198ff). As Price formulates the criticism he says\nthat the sign-theory fails to give any account of the role of symbols\n(language) in what he calls \u201cfree thinking\u201d (1953a:\n200ff), that is thinking about things \u201cin their\nabsence\u201d.\n\nFourth, Price points out that regarding someone\u2019s saying that\np as a sign that it is the case that p, something that\nsustains the effectiveness of communication and testimony, is quite\ndifferent from regarding smoke as a sign of fire, in that it requires\nand depends on a rational speaker emitting the assertion. To talk\nsimply of communication as a sign is to under-describe the nature of\ncommunication.\n\nFinally, Price points out that someone can hear and understand an\nutterance without believing it, without treating it as a sign about\nthe world. He suggests, in effect problematically for sign-theories,\nthat understanding is more basic than expectation-generation.\n",
