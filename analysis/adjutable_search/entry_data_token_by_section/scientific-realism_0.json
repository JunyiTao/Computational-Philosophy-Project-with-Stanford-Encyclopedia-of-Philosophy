    "main_text": "What is Scientific Realism? || Epistemic Achievements versus Epistemic Aims\n1.1 Epistemic Achievements versus Epistemic Aims\n\nIt is perhaps only a slight exaggeration to say that scientific\nrealism is characterized differently by every author who discusses it,\nand this presents a challenge to anyone hoping to learn what it is.\nFortunately, underlying the many idiosyncratic qualifications and\nvariants of the position, there is a common core of ideas, typified by\nan epistemically positive attitude toward the outputs of scientific\ninvestigation, regarding both observable and unobservable aspects of\nthe world. The distinction here between the observable and the\nunobservable reflects human sensory capabilities: the observable is\nthat which can, under favorable conditions, be perceived using the\nunaided senses (for example, planets and platypuses); the unobservable\nis that which cannot be detected this way (for example, proteins and\nprotons). This is to privilege vision merely for terminological\nconvenience, and differs from scientific conceptions of observability,\nwhich generally extend to things that are detectable using instruments\n(Shapere 1982). The distinction itself has been problematized (Maxwell\n1962; Churchland 1985; Musgrave 1985; Dicken & Lipton 2006) and\ndefended (Muller 2004, 2005; cf. Turner 2007 regarding the distant\npast). If it is problematic, this is arguably a concern\nprimarily for certain forms of antirealism, which adopt an\nepistemically positive attitude only with respect to the\nobservable. It is not ultimately a concern for scientific realism,\nwhich does not discriminate epistemically between observables and\nunobservables per se.\n\nBefore considering the nuances of what scientific realism entails, it\nis useful to distinguish between two different kinds of definition in\nthis context. Most commonly, the position is described in terms of the\nepistemic achievements constituted by scientific theories\n(and models\u2014this qualification will be taken as given\nhenceforth). On this approach, scientific realism is a position\nconcerning the actual epistemic status of theories (or some components\nthereof), and this is described in a number of ways. For example, most\npeople define scientific realism in terms of the truth or approximate\ntruth of scientific theories or certain aspects of theories. Some\ndefine it in terms of the successful reference of theoretical terms to\nthings in the world, both observable and unobservable. (A note about\nthe literature: \u201ctheoretical term\u201d, prior to the 1980s,\nwas standardly used to denote terms for unobservables, but will be\nused here to refer to any scientific term, which is now the more\ncommon usage.) Others define scientific realism not in terms of truth\nor reference, but in terms of belief in the ontology of scientific\ntheories. What all of these approaches have in common is a commitment\nto the idea that our best theories have a certain epistemic status:\nthey yield knowledge of aspects of the world, including unobservable\naspects. (For definitions along these lines, see Smart 1963; Boyd\n1983; Devitt 1991; Kukla 1998; Niiniluoto 1999; Psillos 1999; and\nChakravartty 2007a.)\n\nAnother way to think about scientific realism is in terms of the\nepistemic aims of scientific inquiry (van Fraassen 1980: 8; Lyons\n2005). That is, some think of the position in terms of what science\naims to do: the scientific realist holds that science aims to produce\ntrue descriptions of things in the world (or approximately true\ndescriptions, or ones whose central terms successfully refer, and so\non). There is a weak implication here to the effect that if science\naims at truth, and scientific practice is at all successful, the\ncharacterization of scientific realism in terms of aim may then entail\nsome form of characterization in terms of achievement. But this is not\na strict implication, since defining scientific realism in terms of\naiming at truth does not, strictly speaking, suggest anything about\nthe success of scientific practice in this regard. For this reason,\nsome take the aspirational characterization of scientific realism to\nbe too weak (Kitcher 1993: 150; Devitt 2005: n. 10; Chakravartty\n2007b: 197; for skepticism about scientific aim-talk more generally,\nsee Rowbottom 2014)\u2014it is compatible with the sciences never\nactually achieving, and even the impossibility of their achieving,\ntheir aim as conceived on this view of scientific realism. Most\nscientific realists commit to something more in terms of achievement,\nand this is assumed in what follows.\n",
