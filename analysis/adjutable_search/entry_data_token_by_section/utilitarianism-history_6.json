    "main_text": "Ideal Utilitarianism\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nSince the early 20th Century utilitarianism has undergone a variety\nof refinements. After the middle of the 20th Century it has\nbecome more common to identify as a \u2018Consequentialist\u2019\nsince very few philosophers agree entirely with the view proposed by\nthe Classical Utilitarians, particularly with respect to the hedonistic\nvalue theory. But the influence of the Classical Utilitarians has\nbeen profound \u2014 not only within moral philosophy, but within\npolitical philosophy and social policy. The question Bentham\nasked, \u201cWhat use is it?,\u201d is a cornerstone of policy\nformation. It is a completely secular, forward-looking\nquestion. The articulation and systematic development of this\napproach to policy formation is owed to the Classical Utilitarians.\n",
