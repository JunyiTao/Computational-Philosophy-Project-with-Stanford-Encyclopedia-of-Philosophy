    "main_text": "The Soul and Its Powers\n5. The Soul and Its Powers\n\nAccording to Aristotle in the De anima,\u201c the soul is in\na sense all things.\u201d James wants to infer from this that all\nthings must somehow preexist in the soul \u201cby a certain\nconformity and resemblance.\u201d (Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 91,\n403). James distinguished between three sorts of conformity: the\nconformity between the sense and the sensibles, that between the\nintellect and intelligibles, and that between the will and appetibles.\nHe thus believed that all sensibles must preexist in the sense-power,\nall intelligibles in the intellective power, and all\n\u201cappetibles\u201d in the appetitive power, i.e., the will. They\ndo not preexist in their fully actualized state, of course; but nor do\nthey preexist as purely indeterminate capacities: James holds that\nthey preexist as \u201cincomplete actualities,\u201d innate and\npermanent qualities of the soul tending toward their actualization.\nBorrowing from Simplicius\u2019 commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, James described a power of the soul as a\n\u201cgeneral (communis) aptitude (aptitudo) or a\nfitness (idoneitas) with respect to the complete act\u201d\n(Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 92, 421) that is divided into further\nspecific \u201cfitnesses\u201d (speciales idoneitates),\n\u201cfollowing the diversity of objects\u201d of that power. For\ninstance, intellect is a general idoneitas that is subdivided\nin specific idoneitates \u201cfollowing the diversity\u201d\nof intelligibles. Despite what the phrase \u201cfollowing the\ndiversity\u201d would have us believe, James did not assert that the\ndivision of fitnesses in the soul exactly mapped the division of kinds\nof objects. Though he was clearly committed to some correspondence\nbetween the two, he believed it was not possible in this life to know\nhow far the division into specific \u201cfitnesses\u201d proceeded,\nand hence how many \u201cfitnesses\u201d there are in the soul. \n\nIn addition to explaining how the soul\u2019s powers relate to\nintelligibles, sensibles and appetibles, James also described their\nrelation to occurrent acts of understanding, sensing, and\nwilling. As with seminal reasons, an aptitude in potency in the soul\nand the corresponding actualized aptitude were not viewed as really\nbut only as modally distinct (Quodl. III, q. 5, p. 84,\n62\u201363). James also held that each power was both passive and\nactive in relation to its actualization: passive inasmuch as a power\nqua power is not yet actualized, active insofar as it tends toward its\nactualization (Quodl. I, q. 12, p. 165, 281\u2013285). To\nthe argument that nothing could be both active and passive in the same\nrespect, James responded that this was true only of transeunt\nactions, such as fire heating a pot, which require the active cause of\nchange to be distinct from the passive recipient of change, not of\nimmanent actions, as are the operations of the soul.\n\nAlthough James held that all the soul\u2019s powers were active, they\nwere not so to the same degree: the will and its aptitudes were\nconsidered to be more active and thus \u201ccloser\u201d to their\nactualization than those of the intellect; and the intellect and its\naptitudes, in turn, were viewed as more active and closer to their\nactualization than those of the senses. Accordingly, James considered\nthat the more active an aptitude or \u201cinclining principle\u201d\nwas, the more causal power it had and the less causal input it\nrequired from other sources.\n\nFrom the foregoing it is easy to see what position James would take in\nwhat was a commonly discussed topic in the thirteenth century, namely\nthe problem whether or not the \u201cessence\u201d of the soul was\nreally different from its powers. The position espoused by the\nscholastics whose teachings James studies most carefully, namely\nThomas Aquinas, Giles of Rome, and Godfrey of Fontaines was the soul\nwas indeed really distinct from its powers. There was, however, a\ncommonly discussed minority position, one that eschewed both real\ndistinction and strict identity (which had few followers): that of\nHenry of Ghent. Henry believed that the powers of the soul were\n\u201cintentionally,\u201d not really distinct from its essence.\nJames, however, sided with Thomas, Giles, and Godfrey, against Henry\n(Quodl. II, q. 14, p. 160, 70\u201371; Quodl. III,\nq. 5, 56\u201384,63). His reasoning was as follows. Given that\neveryone agreed that there was a real distinction between the essence\nof the soul and one of its powers in act, that is, between\nthe soul and, e.g., an occurrent act of willing, then if one denied\nthat there was a real distinction between the soul and its powers, as\nHenry had, one would be committed to the existence of a real\ndistinction between the power in act (the occurrent act of willing)\nand that same power in potency (the will qua capable of produce that\nact). But as we have already seen, James believed that something in\npotency is not really distinct from that same thing in act. Hence the\nsoul\u2019s essence must be distinct from its powers.\n",
