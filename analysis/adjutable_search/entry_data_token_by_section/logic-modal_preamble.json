    "main_text": "\n\nA modal is an expression (like \u2018necessarily\u2019 or\n\u2018possibly\u2019) that is used to qualify the truth of a\njudgement. Modal logic is, strictly speaking, the study of the\ndeductive behavior of the expressions \u2018it is necessary\nthat\u2019 and \u2018it is possible that\u2019. However, the term\n\u2018modal logic\u2019 may be used more broadly for a family of\nrelated systems. These include logics for belief, for tense and other\ntemporal expressions, for the deontic (moral) expressions such as\n\u2018it is obligatory that\u2019 and \u2018it is permitted\nthat\u2019, and many others. An understanding of modal logic is\nparticularly valuable in the formal analysis of philosophical\nargument, where expressions from the modal family are both common and\nconfusing. Modal logic also has important applications in computer\nscience. \n",
