Theory of Sense Perception\n\nAs the \u201cmechanical philosophy\u201d of Descartes and others\nreplaced the Aristotelian physics, the theory of sensory qualities\nrequired revision. This was especially true for what came to be known\nas the \u201csecondary qualities\u201d (in the terminology of Robert\nBoyle and John Locke). The secondary qualities include colors, sounds,\nodors, tastes, and tactile qualities such as hot and cold. The\nAristotelians maintained that these qualities exist in objects as\n\u201creal qualities\u201d that are like instances or samples of the\nquality as experienced. A red thing possesses the quality red in just\nthe same way it possesses a shape: it simply is red, and we experience\nthat very redness when we see a red object (the \u201cresemblance\nthesis\u201d from Sec. 3.5).\n\nDescartes sought to replace \u201creal qualities\u201d with a\nmechanistic account of qualities in objects. The sensory qualities of\nobjects would be explained by what were later called \u201cprimary\nqualities\u201d (such as size, shape, position, and motion).\nAccordingly, Descartes rendered light as a property of particles and\ntheir motions: it is a \u201ctendency to move\u201d as found in a\ncontinuous medium and radiating out from a luminous body. When light\nstrikes an object, the particles that constitute light alter their\nrotation about their axis. \u201cSpin\u201d is what makes light have\none color rather than another. When particles with one or another\ndegree of spin interact with retinal nerves, those nerves jiggle in a\ncertain way. In the brain, this jiggling affects the animal spirits,\nwhich in turn affect the mind, causing it to experience one or another\ncolor. Color in objects is thus that property of their surface that\ncauses light particles to spin in one way or another, and hence to\ncause one sensation or another (Diop. I, 6:85, 91\u20132).\nSound arises from vibrations in sounding things, and odor from shaped\nparticles that differentially affect the olfactory nerves.\n\nDescartes introduced this new theory of sensory qualities in the first\nsix chapters of Light. He defended it by arguing that his\nexplanation of qualities in bodies in terms of size, shape, and motion\nare clearly understood by comparison with the Aristotelian qualities\n(11:33). Subsequently, in the Meditations and\nPrinciples, he supported this account by appeal to the\nmetaphysical result that bodies possess only geometrical modes of\nextension (Med. V, Princ. I.69, II.4\u20135,\nIV.199). Real qualities are ruled out because they are not themselves\ninstances of size, shape, or motion (even if patches of color have a\nsize and a shape, and can be moved about).\n\nIn addition to a new theory of sensory qualities, Descartes offered\ntheories of the way in which the spatial properties\u2014size, shape,\ndistance, and position\u2014are perceived in vision. In\nDescartes\u2019 day and before, \u201coptics\u201d was defined as\nthe theory of vision, including physical, physiological, and\npsychological aspects. In antiquity, Euclid and Ptolemy wrote on\noptical problems. During the Middle Ages, the Arabic natural\nphilosopher Ibn al-Haytham produced an important new theoretical work\non vision that included an extensive account of the perception of\nspatial properties.\n\nThe theoretical terrain in optics changed with Kepler\u2019s doctrine\nthat vision is mediated by the retinal image and that the retina is\nthe sensitive body in the eye. Previous theorists generally believed\nthat the \u201ccrystalline humor,\u201d now known as the lens, was\nthe sensitive body. Descartes accepted Kepler\u2019s result and\nframed a new theory of spatial perception. Some of his theorizing\nsimply adapted Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s theories to the newly discovered\nretinal image. Ibn al-Haytham held that size is perceived by combining\nthe visual angle that a body subtends with perception of its distance,\nto arrive at a perception of the true size of the object. (Visual\nangle is formed by the directions from a vantage point to a\nseen-object for a given fixation, e.g., the angle formed by the\ndirection to the feet and to the crown of the head of a person\nstanding at moderate distance to us.) In Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s\nscheme, visual angle is registered at the surface of the crystalline\nhumor. Descartes held that size is perceived by combining visual angle\nwith perceived distance, but he now treated visual angle as the extent\nof an object\u2019s projection onto the retina. (On spatial\nperception from Euclid to Descartes, see Hatfield 2020.)\n\nIn Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s account, if the size of an object is known,\ndistance may be perceived through an inference; for a given size, an\nobject\u2019s distance is inversely proportional to its visual angle.\nDescartes recognized this traditional account (Diop. VI,\n6:138\u201340), depending as it does on past experience of an\nobject\u2019s size and on an inference or rapid judgment that\ncombines perceived visual angle with this known or remembered size.\nDescartes held that these judgments are habitual and happen so quickly\nthat they go unnoticed, as do the sensations that present visual\nangle, being rapidly replaced by visual experiences of objects at a\ndistance (Sixth Replies, Med. 7:437\u201338).\n\nIbn al-Haytham further maintained that distance can be perceived by an\nobserver\u2019s being sensitive to the number of equal portions of\nground space that lie between the observer and a distant object.\nDescartes did not adopt this explanation. However, Descartes used his\nmechanistic physiology to frame a new account of how distance might be\nperceived that drew on Kepler\u2019s results.\n\nIn the Keplerian theory of how the eye works, an image is formed on\nthe retina as a result of refraction by the cornea and lens. For\nobjects at different distances, the focal properties of the system\nmust be changed, just as the focal length of a camera is changed\n(Kepler 1611, prop. 64). There were several theories of how this might\noccur, and Descartes sometimes said merely that the shape of the eye\nchanges to accommodate for near and far vision (Diop. VI,\n6:137), sometimes that specifically the shape of the lens changes\n(Man 11:155\u201356, 159). He then theorized that this\nchange in the shape of the lens must be controlled by muscles, which\nthemselves are controlled by nerve processes in the brain.\n\nDescartes realized that the central nervous state that controls\naccommodation would vary directly in proportion to the physical\ndistances of objects. However, unlike the case of inferring distance\nfrom known size and visual angle, Descartes did not suppose that the\nmind is aware of the apparatus for controlling the accommodation of\nthe eye. Rather, he supposed that the central brain state that varies\nwith distance directly causes an idea of distance in the mind, by an\n\u201cinstitution of nature,\u201d which is innate (Diop.\nVI, 6:137*; see also Man 11:183). An institution of nature is\na relationship between characteristics of brain activity and a\nresulting idea or sensation. In this case, the brain state controlling\naccommodation causes the idea (sensation or perception) of distance.\nSuch institutions also link characteristic brain states with color\nsensation (Diop. VI, 6:130; see Mantovani 2022).\n\nWhen we correctly perceive the distance and combine it with visual\nangle (by an unnoticed mental act), the result is a veridical\nperception of a size-at-a-distance. Descartes described the resulting\nperception as possessing the attributes that were labelled \u201csize\nconstancy\u201d in the twentieth century:\n\nConcerning the manner in which we see the size and shape of objects, I\nneed not say anything in particular since it is included in the way we\nsee the distance and position of their parts. That is, we judge their\nsize by the knowledge or opinion that we have of their distance,\ncompared with the size of the images they imprint on the back of the\neye\u2014and not simply by the size of these images. This is\nsufficiently obvious from the fact that the images imprinted by\nobjects very close to us are a hundred times bigger than those\nimprinted by objects ten times farther away, and yet they do not make\nus see the objects a hundred times larger; instead they make the\nobjects look almost the same size, at least if their distance does not\ndeceive us. (Diop. VI, 6:140)\n\n\nWhen Descartes speaks of taking into account the \u201csize of the\nimages\u201d on the retina, he need only be speaking of visual angle,\nwhich is equivalent to retinal-image size. In saying that a nearby\nobject is a hundred times larger on the retina than one ten times\nfarther away, he is speaking of area; the nearby object would be ten\ntimes larger in linear height. If visual angle and object distance are\ncorrectly perceived and combined, the object\u2019s constant true\nsize is perceived. If we get the distance wrong, as in underperceiving\nthe distance to the sun and moon, we misperceive the size, in this\ncase, as too small (Diop. VI, 6:144\u201345).\n\nDescartes\u2019 work on visual perception is but one instance of his\nadopting a naturalistic stance toward conscious mental experience. The\nPassions constitute another (Sec. 6). It is sometimes said\nthat Descartes\u2019 dualism placed the mind outside nature by\nrendering it as an immaterial substance. That is a retrospective\njudgment from a perspective in which immaterial substances are\nautomatically deemed \u201cunnatural.\u201d For Descartes and his\nfollowers, mind\u2013body interaction and its laws were included\nwithin the domain of natural philosophy or physics (in the general\nmeaning of the latter term, as the theory of nature). Descartes spoke\nof regular relations between brain states and the resulting sensory\nexperiences, which his followers, such as Regis, subsequently deemed\n\u201claws\u201d of mind\u2013body relation (see Hatfield 2000). In\nthis way, Descartes and his followers posited the existence of\npsychophysical or psychophysiological laws, long before Gustav Fechner\n(1801\u20131887) formulated a science of psychophysics in the\nnineteenth century.\n",
