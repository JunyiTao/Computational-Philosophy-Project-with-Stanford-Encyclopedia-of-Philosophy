    "main_text": "Logic || Applications\n2.3 Applications\n\n\nThis section mentions briefly some other applications of\nSylvan\u2019s preferred logics to a wide range of philosophical\nproblems. Sylvan saw applications as a test for the choice of such\ntheories over rival logics. Sections 3 and 4 are in a way extended\ndiscussions of such applications. Sylvan argued that relevant and,\nmore broadly, what he termed \u201csociative logics\u201d had\napplications in areas as diverse as causation, an analysis of\nknowledge, vagueness (including the idea that there are vague objects;\nsee Sylvan and Hyde 1993), and value theory. Here we sketch two such\napplications, in confirmation, and computation.\n2.3.1 Confirmation\n\n\nFollowing Goddard (1977), Sylvan (along with Nola, in 1991) applies\nrelevant logic to solve the paradoxes of confirmation made\nfamous by Hempel. These are problems in philosophy of science about\nformulating inductive generalizations such as\n\nAll ravens are black,\n\n\nwhich is confirmed by instances of things which are both black and\nravens; but the universal generalization is logically equivalent to\nits contrapositive form\n\nAll non-black things are non-ravens,\n\n\n\nwhich would similarly be confirmed by any non-black non-raven; but\nsince e.g., a red pencil is obviously not confirmation that\nall ravens are black, something has gone wrong. For Sylvan, the\nproblem\u2014as is often his diagnosis\u2014lies in the\nformalization of the natural language claims\u2014\u201cIt is\nwell-known in relevance circles that the most outrageous of these\nparadoxes are automatically removed by replacement of the material\nconditional \u2026\u201d (2000a, 227). \u201cA relevance\nshift,\u201d he argues with typical restraint, \u201cis a sure-fire\nway of knocking out all the paradoxes of confirmation\u201d (2000a,\n232.). For discussion, see Fitelson (2006).\n2.3.2 Computation\n\n\nAlong other lines, Sylvan made tentative steps in the foundations of\nrecursion theory, towards a non-classical theory of computation (cf.\nCopeland and Sylvan 1999; Sylvan 2000a). According to work by Turing,\nChurch, and G\u00f6del in the 1930s, computers face logical limits on\nwhat they can compute (see the entry on the Church-Turing thesis and\nthe entry on computability and complexity). Uncomputability proofs,\nthough, bear a very strong resemblance to the derivations of\nRussell\u2019s paradox and other diagonal paradoxes. If\n\u201cdialectical\u201d logic can be used to solve those paradoxes,\nthough\u2014essentially, by accepting that they have truly\ncontradictory conclusions (see Section 2.2 above)\u2014then could the\nsame be done in the case of computers? Then the conclusion would\nbe, not that there are uncomputable algorithms, but rather\n\u201cthere are more algorithmic functions than all algorithmic\nfunctions\u201d (2000a, 195). Sylvan envisions \u201cdialeth[e]ic\nmachines\u201d; cf. Weber (2016).\n2.4 Summary\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s approach to logic is of a piece with his work in\nmetaphysics and ethics: a polemical rebuke of the perceived powers of\nthe day\u2014in the case of logic, the hegemony of classical\nlogic\u2014and a highly imaginative and open-minded attitude towards\nwhat sorts of entities\u2014possible and impossible alike\u2014our\nbest theories should condone. We turn now to these other aspects of\nhis work.\n3. Ontology and Metaphysics\n\n\nIn this section, we present Sylvan\u2019s work in ontology and\nmetaphysics. As discussed below, Sylvan was deeply inspired by Alexius\nMeinong but, as a matter of terminology, their understanding of\n\u2018ontology\u2019 and \u2018metaphysics\u2019 differ: while\nMeinong would situate metaphysics and ontology as small corners within\na more general object theory, Sylvan situated them the other way\naround. (See, for instance, Meinong 1904, \u00a72 and \u00a711; Sylvan\n1995a, 47). In what follows, we follow Sylvan and employ what we take\nto be contemporary standard usage of \u2018ontology\u2019 (roughly\nunderstood as the study of what exists and what does not) and\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019 (roughly understood as the study of the\nstructure of reality), while acknowledging that Meinong-scholars might\ndispute this use of terms. In Section 3.1, we sketch some of the\nessential features of noneism, that is, Sylvan\u2019s theory\nabout non-existent objects. In Section 3.2, we discuss Sylvan\u2019s\nattempt at expanding the horizons of traditional ontology by\ndeveloping a new theory called sistology. Finally, in Section\n3.3, we summarize Sylvan\u2019s heterodox account of pluralism,\nlabelled plurallism.\n3.1 Noneism\n\n\nFrom 1965 on, Sylvan argued that, through the influence of Quine,\ncontemporary philosophy is committed to a fundamental mistake. Such a\nmistake, labelled the \u201cOntological Assumption\u201d (cf. 1980),\nis represented by the view that one cannot make true statements about\nwhat does not exist. In opposition to this idea, Sylvan develops a\ntheory about (non-existent) objects or, in Sylvan\u2019s jargon,\nitems\u2014noneism.\n\n\n[Noneism is] a very general theory of all items whatsoever, of those\nthat are intensional and those that are not, of those that exist and\nthose that do not (\u2026); it is a theory of the logic and\nproperties and kinds of properties of all items (1980,\n5\u20136)\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s intuition is that, in order to be able to say something\ntrue about non-existent items, we need to allow for the possibility\nthat non-existent items have properties. For instance, in order to be\nable to say that \u2018Sherlock Holmes is a detective\u2019 is true,\nSherlock Holmes needs to have the property of\nbeing a detective. Now, according to Sylvan, a suitable\nphilosophical background for supporting this intuition is\nMeinong\u2019s Theory of Objects. For this reason, in\nExploring Meinong\u2019s Jungle and Beyond (Routley 1980),\nSylvan tries to deliver a modern logical presentation of\nMeinong\u2019s philosophy. He writes:\n\n\nMeinong\u2019s theory provides a coherent scheme for talking and\nreasoning about all items, not just those which exist, without the\nnecessity for distorting or unworkable reductions; and in doing so it\nattributes \u2026 features [properties] to nonentities [non-existent\nobjects] (1980, iv\u2013v).\n\n\nAt nearly 1000 pages, Routley (1980) develops noneism in great\ndetail. We summarize it in five main theses, which represent the core\nassumptions of what Sylvan calls minimal noneism (from now on\nMN). First of all, following Meinong\u2019s account\nof intentionality, Sylvan believes that:\n\n\n(MN1)\n\u201ceverything whatever (\u2026) is an object [an item]\u201d\n\n\n\n(1980, 1\u20132; 352). In other words, every time we refer to\nsomething, we refer to an item. If I tell a story about Sherlock\nHolmes, I tell a story about an item, namely that item that is the\nsubject matter of my story.\n\n\nThe second thesis is that:\n\n\n(MN2)\n\u201cvery many objects [items] do not exist\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2\u20133). Sylvan follows Meinong in claiming that some items\nexist (e.g., the Eiffel Tower) and some others do not (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes). Like Meinong, Sylvan treats existence as a property: some\nitems have the property of being red and some other items do\nnot; some items have the property of being existent (e.g.,\nthe Eiffel Tower) and some items do not (e.g., Sherlock Holmes). When\nitems do not have the property of being existent, they are\nnon-existent items. In Sylvan\u2019s jargon, they are\n\u201cnonentities\u201d.\n\n\nFurthermore, according to the third and fourth theses:\n\n\n(MN3)\n\u201cnon-existent objects [items] are constituted in one way or another\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2\u20133), and\n\n\n(MN4)\n\u201cevery object [item] has the \u2018characteristics\u2019 it has irrespective of whether it exists\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2\u20133). Thesis (MN3)\ncorresponds to Meinong\u2019s indifference principle: the\nproperties an item has are indifferent to the ontological status of\nthe item itself. Thesis (MN4) corresponds\nto Meinong\u2019s independence principle: an item\u2019s\nhaving properties is independent of whether the item in\nquestion exists or not.\n\n\nAs many have pointed out (cf. Russell 1905 and 1907; see also Berto\n2013 and Priest 2005), the original theory defended by Meinong faces\nproblems. In particular, Meinong\u2019s theory is threatened by\ntriviality (Berto 2013, 106\u2013107); that is, the\nsituation in which everything exists\u2014including items that\nclearly do not.  E.g., if I refer to not just to Sherlock Holmes but\nto \u201cthe\nexisting Sherlock Holmes\u201d, then it seems\nby (MN4) that Sherlock Holmes exists.\n\n\nIn order to resolve this issue, Sylvan makes two moves. First of all,\nhe introduces the distinction between characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties. The former are necessary in order to\ndefine the essence of an object. A characterizing property is a\nproperty (e.g., being a detective or being smart)\nthat is necessary in order to make a specific item (e.g., Sherlock\nHolmes) the item that it is. Using Sylvan\u2019s words:\n\n\nCharacterizing predicates [or properties] are those which specify what\nan item is like, in itself. They tell how an item is in fact. They\ngive its description. A good dossier of an item would perhaps give its\ncharacterization first, by way of its characterization features [or\nproperties] (Sylvan 1995b).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the non-characterizing properties are all those\nproperties that are not characterizing. According to Sylvan, the\nproperty of being existent is a non-characterizing\nproperty.\n\n\nAs it has been extensively argued in the secondary literature (see,\nfor instance, Priest 2005), the difference between these two kinds of\nproperties is unclear. It is also fair to say that, even though some\n(neo-)Meinongians have tried to cash out such a distinction in more\nprecise terms (see, for instance, Jacquette 2015 and 2017; Parsons\n1978 and 1980), there is little consensus that any progress has been\nmade. That being said, even though it is certainly difficult to have\nstrict criteria to separate the characterizing properties from the\nnon-characterizing ones, it is absolutely clear that:\n\n\n(MN5)\n\u201cneither existence nor non-existence is a characterizing property\u201d\n\n\n\n\n(1980, 2). This is the fifth and last thesis.\n\n\nThe second move Sylvan makes in response to the triviality problem is\nrepresented by the idea that, even though it is the case that every\ntime we refer to something we refer to an item, the item in question\nhas characterizing properties. Following Berto (2013), we can also say\nthat, consistent with some other neo-Meinongians (i.e., Jacquette 2015;\nParsons 1980), Sylvan argues in favour of the following\ncharacterization principle:\n\n\nfor any set of characterizing properties, some item satisfies\nit.\n\n\nConsider, for example, Sherlock Holmes. When we refer to Sherlock\nHolmes, we refer to an item (because of\n(MN1)). Moreover, even though Sherlock\nHolmes does not exist (because of (MN2)),\nhe has some characterizing properties (because of\n(MN3) and\n(MN4)). For instance, according to\nDoyle\u2019s novels, Sherlock Holmes is a smart detective. If so, in\nSherlock Holmes\u2019s set of characterizing properties, there are, at\nleast, two properties: being a detective and being\nsmart. However, the property being non-existent is not in\nthis set because it is a non-characterizing property. And this is\nguaranteed by (MN5).\n\n\nAs we have already specified above, minimal noneism is merely\nthe core of Sylvan\u2019s noneism which is more elaborate and\nsophisticated than sketched here. Exactly because of its complexity,\nnoneism forces us to rethink some of our traditional approaches to\nimportant philosophical topics. Examples are intensionality,\nnonexistence, impossibilia, and paradoxicality. Moreover, in the light\nof these conceptual innovations, Sylvan also discusses some of the\nrelevant applications of noneism in philosophy of mathematics (cf.\n1980, 769\u2013781 and 791\u2013833), philosophy of perception\n(cf. 1980, 649\u2013678), philosophy of time (cf. 1980,\n361\u2013410); philosophy of science (cf. 1980, 781\u2013791) and\nphilosophy of fiction (cf. 1980, 537\u2013595).\n\n\nSylvan spent many years developing and defending noneism, but he was\nnot entirely satisfied with it. He had two major complaints. On the\none hand, he thought that his way of presenting noneism was\nrhetorically problematic: EMJB was too long, rambling, and not\nincisive enough. As such, EMJB needed to be rewritten (see Sylvan\n1995b). On the other hand, he aimed at \u201cliberalizing\nnoneism\u201d by allowing all items to have both characterizing and\nnon-characterizing properties (Sylvan 1995b). Archival documents show\nthat, to this end, Sylvan tried to develop a new theory that has many\nfeatures in common with so-called \u201cmodal Meinongianism\u201d,\nrecently defended by Priest. On these issues, see Casati (2018),\nGriffin (2018), Kroon (2019), Priest (2005).\n3.2 Sistology\n\n\nIn late life, Sylvan aimed at enriching the ideas defended in Routley\n(1980) by developing what he calls \u201csistology\u201d. On the one\nhand, sistology adopts all the fundamental ideas of noneism. Like\nnoneism, sistology includes items that do not exist (cf. Sylvan 1991,\n837; 1997, 11\u201312) and it accepts that those items have\nproperties (cf. 1991, 838\u201339). On the other hand, sistology\ndevelops and enriches noneism in the following ways.\n\n\nTo begin with, Sylvan tried to move the focus of his attention from\nthe existence (or non-existence) of items to their being\nitems. Using Sylvan\u2019s words, sistology is concerned with\n\u201call items as having standing\u201d (1991, 838).\nThus, sistology aims at casting a new light on what it means to be\nan item instead of showing that it is possible to have\nnon-existent items. The latter project was the unique task of\nnoneism.\n\n\nSecondly, Sylvan tried to extend and deepen the catalogue of items he\ndealt with in Routley (1980). In an unpublished manuscript, Sylvan\ndescribed an imaginary museum in which all sorts of items are\naccepted. Among those items that have not been (comprehensively)\ndiscussed in his (1980), Sylvan listed:\n\nvacancies, vacuums (such as holes, empty bowls,\nvalleys, and absences);\nwholes, aggregations (such as the totality, everything,\nthe universal set, and the Cosmos);\nsignificant ideological objects (such as the Tao,\nBuddhist ultimate reality, Nirvana, Jehovah); and\ninconsistent objects (such as the square circle).\n\n\n\nIn particular, Sylvan devoted significant effort to this last cluster\nof items, underscoring the idea they require the employment of a\nparaconsistent logic. Given that inconsistent items have inconsistent\nproperties, if classical logic is employed then triviality immediately\nfollows. In order to avoid trivialism, the adoption of a\nparaconsistent logic is required.\n\n\nConsider, for instance, inconsistent objects. (\u2026) By virtue of\nwhat they are, they have contradictory properties, thereby\ntrivializing any theory built upon mainstream logic. An authentic\nsistology requires logical reformulation of a more demanding\nparaconsistent type (Sylvan 1991, 839).\n\n\nThe third and last attempt to develop noneism is represented by a\nserious engagement with the notion of a \u201csource\u201d. As he\nhad already discussed, a \u201csource\u201d is what allows us to\nunderstand the charactering properties that an item (cf. 1980, 463;\n1995a). The source of Anna Karenina\u2019s characterizing properties\nis Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina. In sistology, Sylvan aims\nat deepening our understanding of sources by admitting that not all of\nthem are equally reliable. For instance, optical illusions teach us\nthat visual perceptions are not always a trustworthy source for\ncharacterizing the items we see. For this reason, Sylvan suggests\nintroducing two kinds of predicates. The first kind (call them\n\u201cordinary predicates\u201d) tell us how items look;\nthe second kind (call them \u201cnon-ordinary\npredicates\u201d) tell us how items really are.\n\n\nNot all sources are always reliable or otherwise satisfactory; for\nexample, perceptual sources are notoriously unreliable as to how\nthings really are. (\u2026) Thus, [the] division of\n[ordinary and non-ordinary] properties is presumed (1991, 839; italics\nours).\n\n\nSistology, which is only sketched by Sylvan, nevertheless anticipates\nsome of the ideas currently debated among neo-Meinongians, for\nexample, as discussed above, with \u201citems in general\u201d.\nRegardless of the existence or non-existence of these items, sistology\nconcerns their \u201chaving standing\u201d (1991, 839). In so doing,\nSylvan focuses his attention on one of the most under-researched\nnotions of Meinong\u2019s theory of objects, that is, the so-called\ndoctrine of Outsidebeing [Aussersein]. Only recently\nhave neo-Meinongian started to turn their attention to this topic\n(Casati and Priest 2017; Grossman 1974; Jacquette 2015). So too with\nthe very particular kind of object that is \u201cnothingness\u201d\n(cf. Sylvan 1995a). After a long-standing lack of interest in these\ntopics, neo-Meinongians have begun to take them into serious\nconsideration as well (Casati and Fujikawa 2019; Priest 2014a and\n2014b; Jacquette 2013).\n3.3 Plural(l)ism\n\n\nIn the current philosophical landscape, there are many different forms\nof pluralism on offer. For instance, there is an\nontological form of pluralism (there are different ways of\nbeing), truth pluralism (there are different ways of being\ntrue), and there is a logical form of pluralism (there is\nmore than one correct logic; see the entry on logical\npluralism). However, it is almost universally assumed, if mostly\nunstated, that there can be no pluralism about the actual\nworld\u2014this one is the only\nactual one. As should appear clear from this entry, though,\nSylvan was accustomed to challenging the philosophical consensus. He\nbegan by attacking classical logic, he continued by questioning the\nso-called Ontological Assumption and, late in his career, he decided to\nchallenge what he calls one-world-ism, that is, the idea that\nthere is only one actual world.\n\n\nSylvan argues that there is a plurality of actual worlds we all live\nin. In his Transcendental Metaphysics (1997) he claims:\n\n\nA theme, to be defended at length, is that while there is\nan actual world, which is suitably external,\nmind-independent, perceiver-independent, and the like, it is not\nunique. There are many actual worlds. That theme is bound to\nstrike others, as it still occasionally strikes me momentarily, as\nutterly outrageous. [My] work and arguments are designed to remove\nthis misconception (1997, 4).\n\n\nIn order to draw a clear distinction between his pluralism and the\nothers, he refers to his own theory with a neologism:\nplurallism. The aims of such a theory are summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe overarching themes of plurallism are (\u2026): (1) There is\nno unique world. There is no unique actual universe; (2)\nThere is no one unalterable truth; no single Way of Truth; (3)\nThere is no single correct Scientific Theory (1997,\n4).\n\n\nIn order to support these ideas, Sylvan presents two sets of\narguments.\n\n\nSylvan argues indirectly there is a lack of (good) arguments\nin favour of the uniqueness of the actual world. From the fact that\nthere is such a thing as an actual world it does not necessarily\nfollow that such a world is unique, nor is its uniqueness observable\n(cf. 1997, 54\u201360).\n\n\nOn the other hand, he directly supports plurallism by arguing\nthat for each area of research, there is (or there could be) a\nplurality of correct theories. His reasoning goes as follows. All\ntheories are grounded on logic because logic is necessary for\nreasoning about both the data used by those theories and the theories\nthemselves. And, if there is, not just one, but a plurality of\ncorrect logics, there is (or there could be) a plurality of\ncorrect theories which spring from all those different, but all\nequally acceptable, ways of reasoning as well (cf. 1997,\n61\u201374). From this, a plurality of actual worlds follows if we\naccept two enthymematic assumptions. The first one is that any correct\nlogic, in virtue of its being correct, properly describes an actual\nworld. If so, if there is more than one correct logic, there is more\nthan one actual world too. The second assumption, then, is that there\nare many correct logics. This idea was not shared by Sylvan\u2019s\ncontemporaries but one that he came to defend late in his career,\nclaiming (1997, xix) \u201cthat not merely is there a plurality of\nlogics, but there is also [a plurality] of correct logics\u201d. The\nidea is elaborated on in Sylvan (1997, ch. 4) and is now widely\ndiscussed in the literature (see, for instance, Beall and Restall\n2000; Russell 2008; Weber 2017b). Sylvan claims that phenomenological\ndata seems to support plurallism as well (cf. 1997,\n118\u2013133).\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s motivations for developing plurallism are not uniquely\nphilosophical. On the contrary, he believes that the existence of the\nplurality of actual worlds can have important political consequences\ntoo. One of those consequences is the extension and strengthening of\nour idea of tolerance. According to Sylvan, intolerant behaviours are\noften, if not always, grounded on ideologies driven by what he calls\nthe \u201cone-true-way\u201d (1997, 462) or the\n\u201cone-admissible-way\u201d (1997, 462). Governments,\nreligious groups, and even scientists believe that \u201ctruth should\nbe imposed\u201d (1997, 462) where truth is what is uniquely\ndetermined by them. Plurallism invites us to entertain the idea that,\nas there is no such thing as a unique actual world, there is no such\nthing as a unique truth. And this should undermine the ideological\nroots of intolerant behaviours.\n3.4 Summary\n\n\nIn many ways, Sylvan\u2019s philosophical and logical research is\ndevoted to the attempt to be inclusive, open-minded, and, therefore,\ntolerant. Contra the Quinean admiration for desert landscape,\nSylvan admired an over-crowded jungle of ideas in which different\nlogics, all sorts of items, and a plurality of actual worlds could\npeacefully coincide.\n4. Moral Philosophy\n\n\nIn this section we describe Sylvan\u2019s work in moral philosophy.\nHis seminal and frequently reprinted (1973; see also SEP entry\n\u201cEnvironmental Ethics\u201d Section 2) was, alongside Naess\n(1973), the first published work in environmental ethics and began a\ncentral debate in the area, one concerned with intrinsic value in\nnature. Elaborated on in Routley and Routley (1979b) and (1980a), this\nwork developed arguments against what he termed \u201chuman\nchauvinism\u201d\u2014the view that humans are exceptional in being\nthe sole locus of intrinsic value, all else having merely instrumental\nvalue. Alongside this work in environmental ethics more broadly, which\nwas to continue until his death, he also published in defence of\npacifism, against nuclear war, and was one of the first philosophers\nto point to the emerging moral issues associated with anthropogenic\nglobal warming.\n4.1 The Last Man Example\n\n\nDeveloping out of influential work condemning Australian forestry\npractices in the early 1970s, (cf. Routley and Routley 1973a, Byron\n1999), Routley (1973)\u2014\u201cIs There a Need for a New, an\nEnvironmental, Ethic?\u201d\u2014presents a thought experiment\ndesigned to test what Sylvan took to be a core principle of Western\nethical systems, the Freedom Principle:\n\n\nOne should be able to do what he wishes, providing (1) that he does\nnot harm others and (2) that he is not likely to harm himself\nirreparably (1973, 15)\n\n\nHe calls this principle basic human chauvinism \u201cbecause\nunder it humans, or people [whether present or future], come first and\neverything else a bad last\u201d\u2014a view later characterized as\n\u201canthropocentric\u201d in the much expanded discussion of The\nLast Man Example in Routley and Routley (1980a, cf. 96).\n\n\nWe are invited to consider a world in collapse where humanity is\nreduced to a single person who then proceeds to eliminate, to the best\nof their abilities, \u201cevery living thing, animal or plant (but\npainlessly if you like, as at the best abattoirs).\u201d (1973, 16)\nWith the demise of the last man (which we may suppose occurs\nimmediately prior to the wholesale destruction unleashed), there are\nno humans\u2014either others or the last man himself\u2014who could\nbe harmed by such an act and so, with clauses (1) and (2) satisfied,\nthe act is permissible according to the \u201chuman chauvinist\u201d\nWestern ethical systems. (And even if \u201cothers\u201d were\nextended to include non-human sentient creatures, still no harm,\nunderstood as suffering, would accrue given the act is done\n\u201cpainlessly\u201d.) Yet, \u201cwhat he does is wrong\u201d\nand therewith we have a counterexample to such chauvinism and\nassociated Western ethical systems, and a claimed need for a new\nethic, \u201can environmental ethic\u201d, capable of accounting for\nthe wrongness of the last man\u2019s act. (As in his logical work,\nSylvan\u2019s strategy is to try to isolate what is sufficient (in\nthis case, for wrongness) by considering \u201cdistant\u201d\npossible worlds.)\n\n\nGranting the wrongness of the last man\u2019s act, is a \u201cnew\nethic\u201d really required? Preference utilitarianism has been\nconsidered as a \u201ctraditional\u201d ethic capable of condemning\nthe last man. (Cf. Elliot 1980, 20 and 23; and Carter 2004,\n51\u201352 for a more limited condemnation along preference\nutilitarian grounds.) Where there is an overwhelming preference for\npreservation of the world beyond the death of the last man, and its\ndestruction would thus harm those having such a preference, the\nFreedom Principle would already appear to prohibit such an act\n(assuming the aggregated harm outweighs any benefit in the\nsatisfaction of contrary preferences). But notice that condemnation,\non this view, is highly contingent, depending on people\u2019s\npreferences (condemnation is justified only if preferences\nconflict with destruction). Since the condemnation is thought to be\nwarranted with \u201cno ifs and buts\u201d, yet this\n\u201ctraditional\u201d response offers the correct judgement only\nin special circumstances, for Sylvan, it counts as \u201ctoo\nparochial\u201d (Routley 1973, 20). (Cf. Lamb 2018, 532\u20133 for a\nsimilar point.)\n\n\nReacting, in part, to Leopold\u2019s call for a \u201cland\nethic\u201d, Sylvan\u2019s subsequent work in the area (much of the\nearly work with Val Routley, later Val Plumwood) proceeds to describe\nand argue for just such a non-anthropocentric, environmental ethic. A\ndominant aspect of this \u201cnew\u201d ethic (indeed, a\ncharacterising feature in Elliot 1980) that was fixed on by\nsubsequent authors was the extension of non-instrumental,\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d or \u201cfinal\u201d values to the non-human\nworld. First mentioned in 1974 in early drafts of Routley and Routley\n(1980a) and subsequently Val Routley (1975), Rolston (1975), and\nCallicott (1979)\u2014who all employ versions of the Last Man\nExample\u2014the extension is described and defended at length in\nRoutley and Routley (1980a). (Sylvan assumes intrinsic value is, in\ngeneral, already assured on the familiar Aristotelian ground that\ninstrumental value requires intrinsic value, lest vicious regress\nensue\u2014cf. Aristotle Metaphysics, 994b9\u201315.)\n\n\nSylvan and Plumwood hypothesise that what underpins the deontic\nprohibition of the last man\u2019s act is the truth of the\naxiological claim that entities in non-human nature can possess more\nthan mere instrumental value\u2014non-human nature \u201ccan have\nvalue and create obligations not reducible (in any way) to human\ninterests\u201d (1980a, 129). While such items may have instrumental\nvalue, value as a means to human ends, advantaging us in various\nways\u2014e.g., the value of forests in supplying water for human\nconsumption\u2014they might also have \u201cnon-instrumental\u201d,\nor what the Routleys called \u201cintrinsic\u201d value (1980a, 126\nand 129). Thus, the rejection of human chauvinism in its deontological\nform (the assertion of and the argument to the falsity of the Freedom\nPrinciple) was accompanied by its rejection in axiological form: not\nonly humans have intrinsic value; non-human nature may also be the\nlocus of intrinsic (non-instrumental) value.\n\n\nWhile accepting that we may have moral obligations with respect to or\nregarding entities in the non-human world, Routley (1973, 19) and\nRoutley and Routley (1980a, 174ff) deny that this entails our having\nobligations to them and deny, too, their having correlative\nrights. Sylvan rejects such an extension of rights to non-human\nentities. For this reason, he takes the \u201cnew environmental\nethic\u201d to \u201cdiffer markedly\u201d from alternatives like\nLeopold\u2019s land ethic. As it developed, it also differed markedly\nfrom most forms of utilitarianism for a broad range of reasons,\narguing instead for a deontologically constrained \u201coptimisation\napproach to value theory\u201d. (See Routley and Routley 1985; Sylvan\n1992.) Variants of Last Man counterexamples to traditional Western\nethics are also taken to show that the distribution of intrinsic value\nextends beyond sentient individuals\u2014contra \u201canimal\nliberationists\u201d (1980a, 125) like Singer\u2014so that\n\u201ccandidates for value \u2026 include all objects\u201d\n(1980a, 140).\n\n\nResisting Sylvan\u2019s broad push for a non-anthropocentric,\nenvironmental ethic are several arguments suggesting the inevitability\nof human chauvinism. Foremost among them are arguments that, he\nclaims, \u201cparallel\u201d arguments for egoism. Their rejection\nfollows similar grounds for rejection of egoism\u2014cf. Routley and\nRoutley (1979b, esp. 47). This paper also distinguishes strong forms\nof human chauvinism (endorsing what Sylvan later termed the sole value\nassumption: that only members of the human class and some of\ntheir possible states have intrinsic value) from weaker forms that\nmerely endorse, for example, \u201cthe Greater Value Thesis: the\ninvariable allocation of greater value or preference \u2026 to\nhumans, while not however entirely excluding non-humans from moral\nconsideration\u201d (ibid., 36)\u2014a thesis also rejected\nby Sylvan. Paske (1991) defends a qualified version of the thesis; the\nmoral differentiation in favour of most humans can be\njustified (by appeal to deontologically-constrained hedonic\nconsequentialism). Attfield (1981), considering versions of the Last\nMan Example, also rejects strong human chauvinism while defending the\ngreater value thesis, thus defending a weak chauvinism in\nSylvan\u2019s sense. \u201cThe good of trees might outweigh some of\nour whims: but it does not outweigh our interests except where our\ninterests depend on it\u201d (1981, 51).\n\n\nPetersen and Sandin, on the other hand, defend a strong form of human\nchauvinism, arguing that the Last Man Example is subject to varying\nresponses depending on the motives attending the act of\nelimination. They thus reject the hypothesis of intrinsic values in\nnature, arguing instead that any supposed wrongness \u201ccan be\nbetter explained by precepts about last man\u2019s character traits\nand motives\u201d (2013, 133). It remains open whether such a\nresponse is adequate for the Last People Example (described by Sylvan\nimmediately following the Last Man Example) who may be said to act\n\u201cfor the best of reasons\u201d though they have acted\n\u201cbadly\u201d (Routley 1973, 16\u201317).\n\n\nA number of arguments against Sylvan\u2019s hypothesised intrinsic\nvalue of natural items focus on supposed problems that attend the\napparently \u201ccosmic\u201d account of value that items are said\nto have in the absence of valuers (e.g., after the demise of the last\nman). Some focus on problems traditionally associated with moral\nobjectivism. If value is conceptually independent of valuers then:\nmoral intuitionism is an unacceptable consequence (cf. Mannison 1980,\n57, the charge of \u201crealism\u201d); moral theory is inconsistent\nwith (the preferred theory) moral projectivism (Carter 2004, who\nclaims a projectivist theory can explain our intuitions concerning the\nlast man); or such value is simply beyond epistemic access and\nirrelevant for decision-making (Justus et al. 2009,\n187\u20138). The latter point echoes earlier claims in Thompson\n(1990), Grey (1993), and Fox (1995) that the hypothesis of intrinsic\nvalue in nature results in values that, being too far removed from\nhuman concerns, are irrelevant as an ethical guide to human action\n(Thompson 1990, 159\u201360; Grey 1993, 464) and, in any event, are\nunnecessary\u2014an enlightened anthropocentrism is sufficient.\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s position on the ontology of values (discussed at length\nin 1980a, esp. 152ff) draws on the Last Man Example to claim that\nthings can, indeed, be valuable at a time when no valuers exist and\nextended thought experiments of a similar kind he takes to further\nestablish that things can be valuable in a world wherein no valuer\nexists at all, though a valuer must exist in some world (1980a, 156,\nfn 67; cf. also Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). Values are, he claims,\nconceptually dependent on valuers\u2014thus the slogan \u201cno\nvalue without valuers\u201d remains true, he contends\u2014and\ntherewith the rock of objectivism is said to be avoided (1980a,\n154). Elliot (1980) also contends that a non-objectivist account is\nsufficient for this kind of value engendered by the last man example,\nthough it is one requiring actual evaluators (\u201cno\nvalues without actual valuers\u201d). He goes on to describe\na subjectivist account that further links values to valuers\nin a manner that \u201cmakes the valuer the sole determinant of a\nthing\u2019s value\u201d (1980, 19) with value reduced to valuer\nevaluations.\n\n\nTaking himself to have avoided objectivism, Sylvan nonetheless argues\nagainst subjectivist accounts\u2014intrinsic values are not\nsubjective either (1980a, 154). Intrinsic value in a world,\nwhile depending conceptually on valuers, nonetheless does not reduce\nto valuers in that world in any way. Some have remarked on\nthe apparent similarities between Sylvan\u2019s account of intrinsic\nvalue and secondary qualities, suggesting his account amounted to a\nresponse-dependent account of intrinsic value (cf. Grey 2000). See\nLamb (2018, \u00a7IX) for argument to the contrary.\n\n\nIn the further elaboration of the \u201cnew ethic\u201d, Routley and\nRoutley (1980a) develops a multiple factor model combining traditional\nvalues, such as the virtues and creature enjoyment, with environmental\nvalue-making factors, for example: diversity of systems and creatures,\nnaturalness, integrity of systems, stability of systems, and harmony\nof systems (170\u2013171). So the shift to an environmental ethic\ndoes not reject ordinarily acknowledged welfare values for persons or\nhumans, but simply recognises a further set of factors contributing to\nintrinsic value in nature (171). Such value-making factors enter into\na mutually constrained optimisation so that the increase of one need\nnot increase the overall intrinsic value of the entity exemplifying\nit; thus, an increase in diversity in a forest may decrease value\ninsofar as it may come at the cost of naturalness (e.g., if the added\ndiversity comes from the anthropogenic addition of feral species not\nnaturally occurring in that forest).\n\n\nThe account of value is non-naturalistic in the sense that value is\nargued to be irreducible to natural features, even though\n\u201cgrounded\u201d in them. (1980a, \u00a75; Sylvan later\ncommitted to the supervenience of intrinsic value on naturalistic\nfeatures, Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 143). It is Meinongian in a number\nof respects\u2014most obviously, drawing freely on Routley (1980),\ncf. esp. \u00a78.11, values are features had by items but, like\nproperties, they do not exist (1980a, 153ff). Sylvan\u2019s moral\nepistemology also draws heavily on Meinong\u2019s account of\n\u201cemotional presentation\u201d (see Lamb 2018, \u00a7VIII):\n\u201cthe valued object may be emotionally presented and its\nvalue thus recognised, without its value simply amounting to\nits emotional presentation\u201d (Routley and Routley 1983, 453). The\naccount is articulated at length in Sylvan (1986). Perhaps\nunsurprisingly, Sylvan\u2019s semantic analysis of value (cf. Routley\nand Routley 1983) makes use of non-classical, relevant logic in its\nformal analysis. (Weber 2017a also draws on Sylvan\u2019s work in\nnon-classical logic to develop a \u201cnew version\u201d of the Last\nMan Example\u2014the \u201cUltramodal Last Man\u201d\u2014with a\nview to avoiding an alleged dilemma besetting the original Last Man\nExample, \u201crenewing a role for non-standard logics in value\ntheory\u201d.)\n4.2 Deep Green Ethics\n\n\nWhile Sylvan views the development of deep ecology sympathetically, he\ndistances himself from the positions being argued for under that\nbanner. His own \u201cdeep green ethics\u201d is described most\nclearly in Sylvan and Bennett (1994, ch. 5). Like deep ecology, the\nposition is, using the term originally coined in Naess (1973),\n\u201cdeep\u201d since it rejects the sole value assumption and\ngreater value thesis. But unlike deep ecology Sylvan rejects, in\nparticular:\n\nbiocentrism\u2014\u201call and only life is valuable\u201d\n\n\n\narguing instead that some non-living things have intrinsic value and\nthat not all life is intrinsically valuable; and\n\nbiospherical egalitarianism\u2014\u201cthe equal value of all life\u201d\n\n\n\narguing instead for eco-impartiality, thus not valuing members of one\nspecies over those of another simply on the basis of species\nmembership, and noting that evaluative impartiality with respect to\nspecies does not entail their equal value. More generally, Sylvan\n(1985) argues that under the strong West Coast US influence deep\necology commits to an assortment of dubious metaphysical and\npsychological themes\u2014often leading to an anthropocentric\n\u201cperson- and consciousness-oriented souffl\u00e9\u201d. And\nlinks to religion, in particular pantheism and nature mysticism,\nthreaten to \u201cconvert deep ecology into a new religion\u201d.\nWhat results is a \u201cdeep ecology\u201d that is\n\u201cconceptually murky\u201d and subject to\n\u201cdegeneration\u201d. As noted in Section 1, laying out these\npoints of difference with deep ecologists in uncompromising style\nearned him the title \u2018the bad boy of deep ecology\u2019 (Orton\n2005, Other Internet Resources). For responses, see Fox (1986) and\nAttfield (1993).\n\n\nHis deep green theory is, following his metaphysical and logical\npluralism (cf. Sylvan 2000b), also pluralistic \u201callow[ing] for\nthe requisite theory dependence and cultural relativity of\nvalues\u201d (1980a, 156), \u201cthere is no uniquely determined\ncorrect value system \u2026 there are various overlapping\nsystems\u201d though he denies that ethical relativism follows from\nthis (Sylvan 1986, 13). He sees the ongoing cultural project of\ndeveloping an adequate environmental ethic as being in its early\nstages.\n\n\nGrey (2000) contends that the (proto)theory faces numerous problems;\nfor further analysis as to whether Sylvan\u2019s position has been\nproperly targeted see Lamb (2018, 565\u201380 passim).\n\n\nNot content with mere theory, as noted in section 1, Sylvan also\nengaged in ambitious practical conservation work, acquiring high-value\nconservation properties for rehabilitation and protection. But the\nvalue of such rehabilitated landscapes is contested in Elliot (1982)\nand Katz (1992). Defending the idea that naturalness of origin is a\nvaluable aspect of wild nature, they argue that not only is restored\nnature of lesser value than any wilderness that it replaces, but the\nrestored copy could be described as \u201ca fake or a forgery\u201d\n(Elliot 1982, 84); restoration involves a \u201cbig lie\u201d as\nKatz puts it. Sylvan thinks they have grossly overstated their case\nand responds in Sylvan (1994)\u2014restored landscapes are not mere\nartifact or fakery. They are not contrived gardens devoid of natural\nvalues, artificial nature falsely presented as the real thing.\n\n\nConsider an area of restored bushland \u2026 The restoration results\nprimarily by nature doing its own thing; it is nothing like furniture\nor pottery making. An ecological restorer, unlike an artisan, does not\nproduce the item, there is no making \u2026 Rather there is\nadjustment at margins \u2026 and there is helping in\nhealing (Sylvan 1994, 68).\n\n\nSylvan argues that Elliot and Katz have illicitly extended the notion\nof an artifact, which is widely and wrongfully deployed in such\ndescriptions of restored natural areas and what they (especially Katz)\nhave failed to grasp is the value-enhancing role that restoration\nplays in the many situations where the damage has already been\ndone. Such restoration \u201cis an addition, an attempt \u2026 to\nclaim back much more of what has [already] been grabbed and degraded\nor ruined\u201d (Ibid., 75). In many cases restoration\nassists nature in reasserting itself and taking control once\nmore. What results lacks certain properties of the original, to be\nsure, especially natural continuity, but contributing to the\nrestoration of something to close-to-original value (as opposed to\nsome low-value fake) is, Sylvan argues, worthwhile and can result in\nnear-natural areas of enormous value. That is value enough.\n\n\nThough Sylvan is uneasy using the term \u2018wilderness\u2019\n\u201cdue to its long history of unfavourable associations and\nconnotation\u201d, he agrees with the broader point being made by\nElliot and Katz\u2014\u201cecological restoration is not an\nalternative to retaining wilderness, to remnant wildernesses\u201d\n(Sylvan 1994, 75). However, they have overstated their case concerning\nthe value of restored landscapes. Elliot was persuaded, admitting that\nhe paid too little attention to the types of restoration that can be\nachieved and underestimated the value and degree of naturalness that\ncan result. In a book-length response to Sylvan and other critics and\nfellow travellers, Elliot (1997) clarifies his argument. Its Preface\nacknowledged the enormous debt to Sylvan. He is, Elliot came to think,\nquite right. \u201cMucking with nature\u201d can result in something\nof significant value and it is, Elliot argued, in many cases\nobligatory to try to undo the damage we have done.\n\n\nA further practical issue which Sylvan sees as requiring theoretical\njustification is predation: the killing of animals for\nfood. \u201cThe vegetarian options face, it certainly seems,\ninsuperable difficulties, especially concerning such issues as animal\npredation (which is an important, immensely frequent, and\noften desirable, ecological fact), and concerning the\nreduction in numbers of animals, especially introduced animals, which\nbuild up to \u2018pest proportions\u2019 (some reduction is often\nrequired for vegetable growing to operate successfully)\u201d\n(Routley 1982, 5). Sylvan himself, for example, culled feral rabbits\n(a damaging, introduced species in Australia) and he consumed the\nanimals killed. While his environmental ethic demands respect for\nintrinsically valuable non-humans, he argues that the\n\n\nrespect position is not a reverence position \u2026 interference is\nacceptable [in certain cases] \u2026 The lives, preferences,\nchoices, and considerations of other species or objects of moral\nconcern are not to be taken as sacred or inviolable [though we]\nrequire that good reasons be given for interfering with the\nenvironment (Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 149).\n\n\nSee Routley (1982, \u00a74) for a defence (a paper which also presents\na moral defence of limited cannibalism). For a similar view see\nCallicott (1980) and for defence of the contrary claim that we ought,\nwhere possible, act to eliminate predation, even cases of wild animals\ntaking prey for food, see Nussbaum (2007, ch. 6).\n4.3 Further Moral Theory\n\n\nIn addition to work in environmental ethics, Sylvan wrote on other\nethical issues including arguments for moral obligations to future\ngenerations (cf. Routley and Routley 1978, Sylvan and Plumwood 1991),\nand the ethics of energy choice (Routley and Routley 1979c). The\nargument offered in the latter paper against nuclear power centres on\nthe (anthropocentric but nonetheless, in Sylvan\u2019s view, salient)\nclaim that bequeathing toxic nuclear waste to future generations\nconstitutes an ethically unacceptable shift of costs onto others. And\na similar argument was mounted against conspicuous consumption of\nfossil fuels from what Sylvan and Plumwood then referred to as\n\u201catmosphere heating\u201d (Routley and Routley 1979c, \u00a73).\nTheirs appear to be amongst the earliest philosophical discussions\nfocussing on the ethics of climate change. And it is not just the\nclaimed immorality following from the consequences of climate change\nto future humans, though that is given weight; from a deep green\nperspective, the claimed erosion of value outstrips mere\nanthropocentric concerns and needs to take into account non-human\nnature, where the resultant erosion of intrinsic value is taken to\nloom large.\n\n\nConsidering destructive practices more generally, beyond those\ndestructive of the environment, Sylvan considered violence against\npersons, arguing that not only was nuclear war immoral, but that which\nconditionally promised it, nuclear deterrence, was also immoral (cf.\nRoutley 1984a). In fact, violence in general was, he argued, immoral,\ndefending pacifism and responding to the standard objections to it in\nRoutley (1984b).\n\n\nIn formal ethics, Sylvan defended a non-classical deontic logic.\nRoutley and Plumwood (1989) argued that the existence of moral\ndilemmas establishes the need both for: (i) a non-classical\npropositional logic underpinning deontic logic; and (ii) the rejection\nof some other central principles of orthodox deontic logic, especially\nthe principle of deontic consistency\n\n\n(PC)\n\\(\\mathrm{O}A \\rightarrow \\twiddle\\mathrm{O}\\twiddle A\\)\n\n\n\nand the Kantian principle ought-implies-can (since dilemmas create\nimpossible obligations). He argues that the sentential fragment of\ndeontic logic must be paraconsistent and a relevant logic is\nrecommended (see Section 2).\n\n\nSylvan saw his ethics as systematically connected with issues in\nsocial and political philosophy, extending out from \u201cdeep green\nethics\u201d to a broader \u201cdeep green theory\u201d that\n\u201cincludes a radical social and political theory, centred upon\nsocial anarchistic forms of organization \u2026 and elements of\nradical economic theory \u2026 There have to be changes in\nsocial and political arrangements \u2026 towards less consumptive,\npopulous and wasteful societies, and so on\u201d (Sylvan and Bennett\n1994, 151).\n\n\nSome of these ideas are discussed at length in Routley and Routley\n(1980b) where alternative forms of economic and political organisation\nare first considered from an environmental perspective. Sylvan focuses\nhis attention on what he takes to be an evident failure of the\npolitical arrangements proposed in the West. According to him, the\ngreat limitations to the freedom of human beings, the uneven\ndistribution of wealth and, above all, the constant damages caused to\nthe environment are all symptoms of a disease that must be treated.\nSylvan argues for what he calls pluralist anarchism, (a form\nof socialist anarchism) abandoning any form of government, including\nthe minimal one defended by Robert Nozick (2013).\n4.4 Summary\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s work in moral theory helped pioneer the rise of\nenvironmental philosophy as a new sub-discipline and connected\nenvironmental issues with broader moral issues as well as issues in\npolitical and social philosophy. Drawing on other work in metaphysics\nand logic, he sought new non-anthropocentric moral foundations,\nheavily critical of both traditional ethics and emerging alternatives\nthat lacked clarity and rigour.\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nThe overall picture that emerges from Sylvan\u2019s work is of a\nbroad philosophy that draws on non-classical (relevant) logic, a\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and a neo-Meinongian value theory as a\nmeans of accounting for \u201ccommon-sense\u201d ways of talking\n(e.g., about things that do not exist), ways of valuing (e.g., the\nseeming intrinsic value of things in the natural world) and\nsocio-political arrangements (e.g., a pluralist\nanarchism). Sylvan\u2019s work was radical, but rigorous; a rich\nmany-worlds semantics underpins formal analyses. His work was\ncontentious; many traditional philosophical \u201cproblems\u201d are\nclaimed to be artefacts of faulty orthodox theories. And his work was\nexpansive; philosophy\u2019s traditional role with the question\n\u201cHow are we to live?\u201d is taken seriously. Above all,\nSylvan\u2019s thought was unified and systematic: \u201cWhat is\nsought is a theory of values which blends both with object-theory and\nwith deeper environmental theory\u2026\u201d (1986, 1).\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s program was left unfinished when he died. Whatever one\nthinks of his bold statements (\u201ca wild mixture of wonderfully\nincisive ideas and absolutely false claims,\u201d as Meyer put it in\n1996), Sylvan pushes philosophers to recognize that many propositions\ntaken as facts are not unrestrictedly true, but rather are\nrelative to what assumptions one is making about logic,\nontology, and value. Changing those assumptions changes the\npossibilities. And Sylvan\u2019s work urges us to be ready for more\npossibilities\u2014even what is, as he put it, \u201cbeyond the\npossible\u201d (this is the title of an unpublished manuscript cited\nin Routley 1980).",
