Introduction\n\nThe problem of how mind and matter are related to each other has many\nfacets, and it can be approached from many different starting points.\nThe historically leading disciplines in this respect are philosophy\nand psychology, which were later joined by behavioral science,\ncognitive science and neuroscience. In addition, the physics of\ncomplex systems and quantum physics have played stimulating roles in\nthe discussion from their beginnings.\n\nAs regards the issue of complexity, this is evident: the brain is one\nof the most complex systems we know. The study of neural networks,\ntheir relation to the operation of single neurons and other important\ntopics do and will profit a lot from complex systems approaches. As\nregards quantum physics, there can be no reasonable doubt that quantum\nevents occur and are efficacious in the brain as elsewhere in the\nmaterial world\u2014including biological\n systems.[1]\n But it is controversial whether these events are efficacious and\nrelevant for those aspects of brain activity that are correlated with\nmental activity.\n\nThe original motivation in the early 20th century for relating quantum\ntheory to consciousness was essentially philosophical. It is fairly\nplausible that conscious free decisions (\u201cfree will\u201d) are\nproblematic in a perfectly deterministic\n world,[2]\n so quantum randomness might indeed open up novel possibilities for\nfree will. (On the other hand, randomness is problematic for\ngoal-directed volition!)\n\nQuantum theory introduced an element of randomness standing out\nagainst the previous deterministic worldview preceding it, in which\nrandomness expresses our ignorance of a more detailed description (as\nin statistical mechanics). In sharp contrast to such epistemic\nrandomness, quantum randomness in processes such as the spontaneous\nemission of light, radioactive decay, or other examples has been\nconsidered a fundamental feature of nature, independent of our\nignorance or knowledge. To be precise, this feature refers to\nindividual quantum events, whereas the behavior of\nensembles of such events is statistically\ndetermined. The indeterminism of individual quantum events is\nconstrained by statistical laws.\n\nOther features of quantum theory, which became attractive in\ndiscussing issues of consciousness, were the concepts of\ncomplementarity and entanglement. Pioneers of quantum physics such as\nPlanck, Bohr, Schr\u00f6dinger, Pauli (and others) emphasized the\nvarious possible roles of quantum theory in reconsidering the old\nconflict between physical determinism and conscious free will. For\ninformative overviews with different focal points see e.g., Squires\n(1990), Kane (1996), Butterfield (1998), Suarez and Adams (2013). \n",
