    "main_text": "Argument for a Non-contingent Cause || Objection 3: The Principles of Causation and Sufficient Reason Are Suspect\n4.4 Objection 3: The Principles of Causation and Sufficient Reason Are Suspect\n\nCritics of the cosmological argument contend that the Causal Principle\nor, where applicable, the broader Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)\nthat underlies versions of the argument, is suspect. As Hume argued,\nthere is no reason for thinking that the Causal Principle is true\na priori, for we can conceive of events occurring without\nconceiving of their being caused, and what is conceivable is possible\nin reality (1748: IV). Neither can an argument for the application of\nthe Causal Principle to the universe be drawn from inductive\nexperience. Even if the Causal Principle applies to events in the\nworld, we cannot extrapolate from the way the world works to the world\nas a whole (Mackie 1982: 85; Kant 1787: B638).\n\nSeveral replies are in order. First, Hume\u2019s conceivability to\npossibility argument is unsound. For one thing, whose conceivability\nis being appealed to here? For another, someone who fails to\nunderstand a necessarily true proposition might conceive of it being\nfalse, but from this it does not follow that it possibly is false. A\nperson might think (wrongly) that pi is a determinate number,\nbut it does not follow that it is so. In the phenomenology of\nconceivability, what is really conceivable is difficult if not\nimpossible to differentiate from what some might think is conceivable.\nAnd even if something is conceivable, say in a logical sense, it does\nnot follow that it is metaphysically or factually possible. One might\nconceive that, since heads can be distinguished from tails on a coin,\nthey can actually be separated, but metaphysically such is impossible.\nWhat is distinguishable is not necessarily separable. Hume, it seems,\nconfuses epistemic with ontological conditions. Hence, the argument\nbased on conceivability is suspect (Reichenbach 1972:\n57\u201360).\n\nSecond, some suggest a pragmatic-type argument to show that the Causal\nand Sufficient Reason principles are true, namely that the principles\nare necessary to make the universe intelligible. Without such\nprinciples, Pruss argues, science itself would be undercut.\n\u201cClaiming to be a brute fact should be a last resort. It would\nundercut the practice of science\u201d (Pruss 2006: 255). Utilization\nof the principles best accounts for the success of science, indeed,\nfor any investigatory endeavor (Koons 1997; see also Koons 2008:\n111\u201312, where he argues that it is \u201ca subjectively\nrequired presumption needed for immunity to internal\ndefeaters\u201d). The best explanation of the success of science and\nother such rational endeavors is that the principles really indicate\nhow reality operates.\n\nCritics reply that the principles then only have methodological or\npractical and not ontological justification. As John Mackie argues, we\nhave no right to assume that the universe complies with our\nintellectual preferences for causal order. We can simply work with\nbrute facts; beginning with them, science would work just as well.\n\nPruss goes further to suggest that the PSR in particular is\n\u201cself-evident, obvious, intuitively clear, in no need of\nargumentative support\u201d (2006: 189). For example, he holds that\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason\u2014\u201cnecessarily, every\ncontingently true proposition has an explanation\u201d (he defers on\nwhether the principle also applies to necessarily true\npropositions)\u2014is self-evident in the sense that anyone who\nunderstands it correctly understands that it is true. These persons\nmight not know it to be self-evidently true, but they do understand it\nto be true. This is consistent with other persons denying it is\nself-evident, for those who deny it might misunderstand the principle\nin various ways. \n\nThe problem with the claim of self-evidence is that it is a\nconversation ender, not a starter. One who denies its self-evidence\nmight think that those who hold to the principle are the ones who\nexperience conceptual blindness. In contrast to analyticity,\nself-evidence holds in relation to the knowers themselves, and here\nintuitions vary, perhaps according to philosophical or other types of\nperspectives. Furthermore, if the principle truly is self-evident, it\nwould be strange to respond to skeptics by attempting to give reasons\nto support that contention, and were such demanded, the request would\nitself invoke the very principle in question.\n\nPruss responds that being self-evident is not incompatible with\nproviding arguments for self-evident propositions, and he thinks that\narguments can show the truth of the PSR to those who deny its\nself-evidence. Among the numerous arguments he advances is a modal\nargument employing a Weak Principle of Sufficient Reason, according to\nwhich \u201cevery contingent proposition possibly has a complete\nexplanation\u201d (Pruss 2006: 234\u201335). We will develop this in\n section 6.\n\nPeter van Inwagen (1983: 202\u201304) argues that the PSR must be\nrejected. If the PSR is true, every contingent proposition has an\nexplanation. Suppose P is the conjunction of all contingent\ntrue propositions. Suppose also that there is a state of affairs\nS that provides a sufficient reason for P. S\ncannot itself be contingent, for then it would be a conjunct of\nP and entailed by P, and as both entailing and entailed\nby P would be P, so that it would be its own sufficient\nreason. However, no contingent proposition can explain itself. Neither\ncan S be necessary, for from necessary propositions only\nnecessary propositions follow. Necessary propositions cannot explain\ncontingent propositions, for if x sufficiently explains\ny, then x entails y, and if x is necessary\nso is y. S cannot be either contingent or necessary, and\nhence the PSR is false. Thus, if the cosmological argument appeals to\nthe PSR to establish the existence of a necessary being whose\nexistence is expressed by a necessary proposition as an explanation\nfor contingent beings, it fails in that it cannot account for the\ncontingent beings it purportedly explains. \n\nHowever, as Pruss notes (2006: chaps. 6 & 7), \u201cThe word\nsufficient can be read in two different ways: the reason\ngiven can be logically sufficient for the explanandum, or it\ncan sufficiently explain the explanandum (2006: 103).\u201d\nAccording to Pruss, we need not hold to the strong claim of logical\nsufficiency about the relation between explaining and entailment in\ncases where the explanation is brought about by libertarian free\nagency. Although God is a necessary being, his connection with the\nworld is through his free agency, and free actions explain but do not\nentail the existence of particular contingent states.\n\nClearly, the soundness of the deductive version of the cosmological\nargument hinges on whether principles like that of Causation or\nSufficient Reason are more than methodologically true and on the\nextent to which these principles can be applied to things, events, and\nfacts. Critics of the argument will be skeptical regarding the\nuniversal application of the principles; defenders of the argument\ngenerally not so, at least as limited to contingencies. Perhaps the\nbest one can say, with Taylor, is that even those who critique the PSR\n(understood broadly that every contingent thing, event, or fact must\nhave a sufficient cause, reason, or ground) invoke it when they\nsuggest that defenders of the principle have failed to provide a\nsufficient reason for thinking it is true. \n\n\nThe principle of sufficient reason can be illustrated in various\nways,\u2026but it cannot be proved\u2026. If one were to try\nproving it, he would sooner or later have to appeal to considerations\nthat are less plausible than the principle itself. Indeed, it is hard\nto see how one could even make an argument for it without already\nassuming it. For this reason it might properly be called a\npresupposition of reason itself. (Taylor 1992: 87) \n\n\n It might be denied that the request for a sufficient\nreason for the truth of principle itself invokes the PSR on the\ngrounds that \u201creason\u201d has two senses, explanation and\nevidence. However, in requesting and giving a sufficient reason for\nthe truth of the principle, the explanation of why it is true should\nprovide sufficient evidence to support the claim. (See the\nintroduction to the entry\n Principle of Sufficient Reason).\n\n\nFinally, critics have argued that an argument for the application of\nthe Causal Principle to the universe cannot be drawn from inductive\nexperience. Even if the Causal Principle applies to events in the\nworld, we cannot extrapolate from the way the world works to the world\nas a whole (Mackie 1982: 85). The type of causation we experience in\nthe empirical world is different from the kind of causation proposed\nto hold between a necessary being and the cosmos (Kant 1787:\nB638).\n\nWe will return to the Principle of Causation below with respect to the\nkal\u0101m argument.\n",
