    "main_text": "Quantifier Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Quine's Criterion, Preliminaries\n1.1 Quine's Criterion, Preliminaries\nQuine's criterion of ontological commitment has dominated\nontological discussion in analytic philosophy since the middle of the\n20th century; it deserves to be called the orthodox\nview. For Quine, such a criterion played two distinct roles. First,\nit allowed one to measure the ontological cost of theories, an\nimportant component in deciding which theories to accept; it thus\nprovided a partial foundation for theory choice.  Moreover, once one\nhad settled on a total theory, it allowed one to determine which\ncomponents of the theory were responsible for its ontological costs\n(see Quine (1960: 270) for the purported benefits of such ontological\nbookkeeping). Second, it played a polemical role. It could be used to\nargue that opponents' theories were more costly than the theorists\nadmitted (see Church (1958), who wields the criterion polemically\nagainst Ayer, Pap, and Ryle). And it could be used to advance a\ntraditional nominalist agenda because, as Quine saw it, ordinary\nsubject-predicate sentences carry no ontological commitment to\nproperties or universals.\nThe locus classicus for Quine's criterion is \u201cOn\nWhat There Is\u201d. Quine writes: \n\nA theory is committed to those and only those entities to which the\nbound variables of the theory must be capable of referring in order\nthat the affirmations made in the theory be true.\n[2] \n(Quine 1948: 33)\n\nTo illustrate: if a theory contains a quantified sentence\n\u2018\u2203x Electron(x)\u2019, then the bound\nvariable \u2018x\u2019 must range over electrons in order\nfor the theory to be true; and so the theory is ontologically\ncommitted to electrons. (For an introduction to the logic of\nquantifiers and bound variables, the basics of which are presupposed\nin this article, see Shapiro (2013).)\nTalk of \u201ccommitment\u201d has an unfortunate connotation: it\napplies more naturally to persons than to theories. But Quine's\ncriterion should be understood as applying to theories primarily, and\nto persons derivatively by way of the theories they accept (Quine\n1953: 103). It would be more perspicuous to speak simply of\nthe existential implications, or ontological\npresuppositions, of a theory. But \u2018ontological\ncommitment\u2019 is well entrenched, and it would be pointless to try\nto avoid it.\nIt is important to note at the start that Quine's criterion\nis descriptive; it should not be confused with\nthe prescriptive account of ontological commitment that is\npart of his general method of ontology. That method, roughly, is this:\nfirst, regiment the competing theories in first-order predicate logic;\nsecond, determine which of these theories is epistemically best (where\nwhat counts as \u201cepistemically best\u201d depends in part on\npragmatic features such as simplicity and fruitfulness); third, choose\nthe epistemically best theory.  We can then say: one\nis ontologically committed to those entities that are needed\nas values of the bound variables for this chosen epistemically best\ntheory to be true. Put like this, the account may seem circular:\nontological commitment depends on what theories are best, which\ndepends in part on the simplicity, and so the ontological commitments,\nof those theories. But there is no circularity in Quine's ontological\nmethod. The above account of ontological commitment is prescriptive,\nand applies to persons, not to theories. What entities we ought to\ncommit ourselves to depends on a prior descriptive account of\nwhat entities theories are committed to. The prescriptive\naccount of ontological commitment serves as a crucial premise in the\nQuine-Putnam indispensability argument for the existence of abstract\nentities (the locus classicus is Putnam 1971). This article,\nhowever, will focus entirely on descriptive criteria of ontological\ncommitment.\nIt is also important to distinguish at the outset\nthe ontological commitments of a theory from\nits ideological commitments (following Quine\n1951a). The ontological\ncommitments of a theory are, roughly, what the theory says exists; a\ntheory is ontologically committed to electrons, for example, if the\ntruth of the theory requires that there be electrons. The ideological\ncommitments of a theory are, roughly, those concepts, logical or\nnon-logical, that are expressible within the theory.  Ontological\ncommitment and ideological commitment are largely independent of one\nanother. For example, a theory may be ontologically committed to there\nbeing Ks, even if the concept of being a K is not\nexpressible in the theory.  In the other direction, a theory may be\nideologically committed to relational concepts that\nadd structure to the entities posited by the theory without\nadding new kinds of entity to the ontology.  There has been a trend in\nrecent metaphysics to take ideological commitment to be as\nimportant\u2014if not more important\u2014than ontological\ncommitment with respect to providing a criterion of theory choice, at\nleast for fundamental theories (see especially Sider 2011:\n12\u201315). In this article, however, only ontological commitment\nwill be discussed.\n",
