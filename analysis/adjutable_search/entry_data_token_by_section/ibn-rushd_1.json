    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nIbn Rushd remained productive for at least four decades. He was the\nauthor of a large corpus that extends over medicine, logic and\nphilosophy in all its branches, including natural philosophy,\nastronomy, metaphysics, psychology, politics, and ethics. His work\nalso includes the sciences of Islamic religion: jurisprudence\n(fiqh), the foundations of Islamic law (us\u016bl\nal-fiqh), the foundations of religion (us\u016bl\nal-d\u012bn), and the science of the Arabic language, including\ngrammar. With important exceptions, most of his works are available in\nthe original Arabic. For those works that have been lost, while\nreaders await the day of their rediscovery, they must generally make\ndo with medieval translations in Hebrew or Latin.\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s work deploys various methods and styles. Many\ntreatises are in the form of a commentary, most famously and\nextensively on Aristotle\u2014covering nearly the whole Aristotelian\ncorpus\u2014but also on Galen\u2019s medical treatises, as\nwell as on other philosophers such as Plato, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and\nIbn B\u0101jja. Many other treatises, devoted to specific issues, are\nnot in commentary form. (For a detailed inventory of texts and\ntranslations see \u00a710.1.)\n\nThe focus of his commentaries was Aristotle because no one has yet\nsurpassed his achievement: \u201cno one who has come after him to\nthis our time\u2014and this is close to 1500 years later\u2014has\nbeen able to add a word worthy of attention to what he said\u201d\n(LongPhys proem; Harvey 1985, 83). Scholarship going back to\nthe nineteenth-century has divided the commentaries into three\nkinds:\n\nthe epitome or short commentary (jaw\u0101mi\u02bf),\nwhich he favored at the start of his career;\nthe paraphrase or middle commentary (talkh\u012b\u1e63),\nseemingly composed throughout his career;\nthe literal or long commentary (shar\u1e25 or\ntafs\u012br), dating to his later years.\n\n\nInasmuch as Ibn Rushd routinely wrote different kinds of commentaries\non the same Aristotelian treatise, some such distinction seems\nnecessary. But recent scholarship has doubted whether this neat\nthreefold distinction adequately captures Ibn Rushd\u2019s complexly\nvaried approach (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b 1986a; Druart 1994; Gutas 1993).\nAt a minimum, it omits important categories of work, such as compendia\n(mukhta\u1e63arat), treatises (maq\u0101l\u0101t),\nand answers to questions (mas\u0101\u02beil), to say nothing\nof the important treatises that focus on religious questions.\n\nThe most prominent of those independent religious treatises are\n\nThe Decisive Treatise (Fa\u1e63l\nal-Maq\u0101l), an argument for the value of philosophy to\nIslam;\nThe Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tah\u0101fut\nal-Tah\u0101fut), a direct response to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\nwhose work had achieved considerable influence at the time in\nAndalusia (Di Giovanni 2019);\nThe Exposition of the Methods of Proof concerning Religious\nDoctrines (al-Kashf \u02bfan man\u0101hij al-adilla f\u012b\n\u02bfaq\u0101\u02beid al-milla), a philosophically nuanced\nalternative to the teachings of Ash\u02bfarite theology.\n\n\nThese works, which seem to have had little influence on medieval\nChristian thought, have traditionally been seen as\n\u201ctheological\u201d and contrasted with his supposedly\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d works: the commentaries on Aristotle that\ncirculated throughout medieval and Renaissance Europe in Latin and\nHebrew translation. The latter were thought to be demonstrative, and\naimed at the elites, whereas the former were said to be merely\ndialectical, and so aimed at a popular audience. Accordingly Ibn\nRushd\u2019s true position supposedly had to be sought in these\nAristotelian commentaries.\n\nThis distinction has affected the direction of scholarship, causing\ngreat attention to be given to the \u201cphilosophical\u201d works,\nwhich were thought to represent most truly his thought, and leaving\nthe \u201ctheological\u201d treatises to be comparatively neglected.\nEven where the latter are widely taught, they are set apart from his\nsupposedly more philosophical commentaries. The result, ever since the\ninitial research of Renan (1852), has been a segmented and fragmentary\nview of the Rushdian corpus that marginalizes important aspects of his\nthought.\n\nAn important correction to this tendency appears in Jamal Al-D\u012bn\nAl-\u02bfAlaw\u012b (1986a), who defends the unity and coherence of\nthe Rushdian corpus. He proposes that Ibn Rushd\u2019s works form a\nunity where there is no room to distinguish between what is a\ncommentary on another text and what is an ostensibly original work.\nWith this, Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b attempted to close a gap in a body of\nwork that should rightly be seen as continuous, and to reconnect texts\nthat have been disassociated from their contexts.\n",
