    "main_text": "The Early Feeling Tradition: Emotions as Feelings\n3. The Early Feeling Tradition: Emotions as Feelings\n\nThe simplest theory of emotions, and perhaps the theory most\nrepresentative of common sense, is that emotions are simply a class of\nfeelings, differentiated by their experienced quality from other\nsensory experiences like tasting chocolate or proprioceptions like\nsensing a pain in one\u2019s lower back. The idea that emotions are a\nspecific kind of subjective experiences has dominated emotion theory\nroughly from Ancient Greece to the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nThis idea can be interpreted in either of two ways. The great\nclassical philosophers\u2014Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Descartes,\nHobbes, Hume, Locke\u2014all understood emotions to involve feelings\nunderstood as primitives without component parts. An alternative idea\nwas first introduced by William James, who argued that scientific\npsychology should stop treating feelings as \u201ceternal and sacred\npsychic entities, like the old immutable species in natural\nhistory\u201d (James 1890: 449).\n\nJames\u2019 proposal, often labeled as the James-Lange theory because\nit is rather similar to the one offered around the same time by Lange\n(1885), stated that emotions are feelings constituted by perceptions\nof changes in physiological conditions relating to the autonomic and\nmotor functions. When we perceive that we are in danger, for example,\nthis perception directly sets off a collection of bodily responses,\nand our awareness of these responses is what constitutes fear. James\nthus maintained that \u201cour feeling of [bodily] changes as\nthey occur IS the emotion\u201d (James 1884:\n189\u2013190, emphasis in original).\n\nThe James-Lange theory fared well with respect to the problem of\nphenomenology, in the sense that it replaced the brute phenomenology\nfavored by earlier accounts with a constructivist account of the\n\u201cprocesses that generate and construct\u2026conscious\nexperiences\u201d (Mandler 1990: 180). This approach has acquired new\nprominence in recent times with the affirmation of the\npsychological constructionist movement in affective science\n (section 8.2).\n\nBut the James-Lange theory seemed less successful with respect to the\nchallenges of motivation, differentiation and intentionality. First,\nJames stated that common sense is wrong about the direction of\ncausation concerning emotions and bodily changes: a more appropriate\nstatement is that \n\n\nwe feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because\nwe tremble, and not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because we are\nsorry, angry, or fearful. (James 1884: 190) \n\n\nThe counterintuitive implication that emotions do not cause their\nmanifestations but rather emerge from them struck many as problematic,\nbecause it seemed to undermine the idea that emotions are important to\nus. How could they be so important, critics like Dewey (1894, 1895)\nasked, if they have no causal import with respect to actions? And why,\none might add, does science not first seek to explain the cause and\nfunction of those original \u201cbodily changes\u201d, namely\nwhy the emotion is elicited in the first place? (Arnold\n1960). \n\nFurthermore, the theory lacked an adequate account of the differences\nbetween emotions. This objection was influentially voiced by Walter\nCannon (1929). According to a common interpretation of the James-Lange\ntheory, what distinguishes emotions from one another is the fact that\neach involves the perception of a distinctive set of bodily changes.\nCannon countered that the visceral reactions characteristic of\ndistinct emotions such as fear and anger are indistinguishable, and so\nthese reactions cannot be what allows us to tell emotions apart.\n\nSubsequent research has not fully settled whether emotions do, in\nfact, have significantly different bodily profiles, either at the\nautonomic, expressive or neural level (for the latest on bodily\nsignatures, see Clark-Polner et al. 2016; Duran et al. 2017; Kragel\n& LaBar 2016; Nummenmaa & Saarim\u00e4ki forthcoming; Keltner\net al. 2016). Independently of how the empirical debate on bodily\nsignatures is settled, brain or bodily changes and the feelings\naccompanying these changes can get us only part way towards an\nadequate taxonomy.\n\nAnother major stumbling block for the James-Lange theory is that it\ndoes not yield any insight into emotions\u2019 role in our life as\nrational agents and thinkers. Emotions, however, are capable of being\nnot only explained, but also justified. If someone angers me, I can\ncite my antagonist\u2019s deprecatory tone; if someone makes me\njealous, I can point to his poaching on my emotional property (Taylor\n1975). If emotions were merely feelings, as James suggested,\nit would be difficult to explain why they can be justified in light of\nreasons, just as we would be hard pressed to justify the sensory\nexperience of tasting chocolate or feeling pain in one\u2019s lower\nback.\n",
