    "main_text": "Towards an epistemology of style\n7. Conclusion\n\nAs pointed out at the outset, the topic of mathematical style is not\none of the canonical areas of investigation in philosophy of\nmathematics. Indeed, this entry is the first attempt to encompass in a\nsingle paper the multifarious contributions to this topic.\nNonetheless, it should be clear by now that reflection on mathematical\nstyle is present in contemporary philosophical activity and deserves\nto be taken seriously. But the work is just beginning. One needs many\nmore case studies of mathematical styles and a clearer articulation of\nthe epistemological and ontological consequences yielded by different\nconceptualizations of style. In addition, one would like to see a\nbetter integration of all this work with the work on cognitive styles\nthat is found in cognitive psychology and mathematical education.\nFinally, standard philosophical chestnuts, such as the relationship of\nform and content to style, and the relation of style to normativity\nand intentionality would also have to be addressed (for a very good\ndiscussion of such topics in aesthetics see Meskin 2005).\n",
