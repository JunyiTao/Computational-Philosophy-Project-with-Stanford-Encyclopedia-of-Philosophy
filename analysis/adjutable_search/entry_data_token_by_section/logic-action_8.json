    "main_text": "The Logic of Action in Computer Science || Reasoning about programs\n3.1 Reasoning about programs\n\nProgram verification has a long history. Already since the inception of the computer and its programming researchers started to think of ways of analyzing programs to be sure they did what they were supposed to do. In the 60s the development of a true mathematical theory of program correctness began to take serious shape (de Bakker 1980, 466). Remarkably, the work of John McCarthy who we will also encounter later on when we turn to the field of artificial intelligence played an important role here, distinguishing and studying fundamental notions such as \u2018state\u2019, McCarthy 1963a. This led on the one hand to the field of semantics of programming languages, and on the other to major advances in program correctness by Floyd (1967), Naur (1966), Hoare (1969) and Dijkstra (1976) (de Bakker 1980). Floyd and Naur used an elementary stepwise induction principle and predicates attached to program points to express invariant properties of imperative-style programs (Cousot 1990, 859), programs that are built up from basic assignment statements (of arithmetical expressions to program variables) and may be composed by sequencing, conditionals and repetitions. While the Floyd-Naur approach\u2014called the inductive assertion method\u2014giving rise to a systematic construction of verification conditions, was a method to prove the correctness of programs by means of logic, it was not a logic itself in the strict sense of the word. The way to a proper logic of programs was paved by Hoare, whose compositional proof method led to what is now known as Hoare logic. By exploiting the syntactic structure of (imperative-style) programs, Hoare was able to turn the Floyd-Naur method into a true logic with as assertions so-called Hoare triples of the form \\(\\left\\{P\\right\\}S\\left\\{Q\\right\\}\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are first-order formulas and \\(S\\) is a program statement in an imperative-style programming language as mentioned above. The intended reading is if \\(P\\) holds before execution of the statement \\(S\\) then \\(Q\\) holds upon termination of (execution of) \\(S\\). (The issue whether the execution of \\(S\\) terminates can be put in the reading of this Hoare triple either conditionally (partial correctness) or nonconditionally (total correctness), giving rise to different logics, see Harel et al. 2000). To give an impression of Hoare-style logics, we give here some rules for a simple programming language consisting of variable assignments to arithmetic expressions, and containing sequential (;), conditional \\((\\lif)\\) and repetitive \\((\\lwhile)\\) composition.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left\\{P\\right\\}S_1\\left\\{Q\\right\\} , \\left\\{Q\\right\\}S_2\\left\\{R\\right\\}}\n     {\\left\\{P\\right\\}S_1 \\ ;\\ S_2\\left\\{R\\right\\}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left\\{P \\wedge B\\right\\}S_1\\left\\{Q\\right\\} , \\left\\{P \\wedge \\neg B\\right\\}S_2\\left\\{Q\\right\\}}\n     {\\left\\{P\\right\\} \\lif B \\lthen S_1 \\lelse S_2 \\left\\{Q\\right\\}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left\\{P \\wedge B\\right\\}S\\left\\{P\\right\\}}\n     {\\left\\{P\\right\\} \\lwhile B \\ldo S \\left\\{P \\wedge \\neg B\\right\\}}\n\\]\n\n\nLater Pratt and Harel generalized Hoare logic to dynamic logic (Pratt 1976, Pratt 1979a, Harel 1979, Harel 1984, Kozen and Tiuryn 1990, Harel et al. 2000), of which it was \n realized[1] \nthat it is in fact a form of modal logic, by viewing the input-output relation of a program \\(S\\) as an accessibility relation in the sense of Kripke-style \n semantics.[2] \nA Hoare triple \\(\\left\\{P\\right\\}S\\left\\{Q\\right\\}\\) becomes in dynamic logic the following formula: \\(P \\rightarrow[S] Q\\), where [\\(S\\)] is the modal box operator associated with (the accessibility relation associated with) the input-output relation of program \\(S\\). The propositional version of Dynamic Logic, PDL, was introduced by Fischer and Ladner (1977), and became an important topic of research in itself. The key axiom of PDL is the induction axiom\n\n\\[\n[S^* ] (P \\rightarrow[S] P) \\rightarrow(P \\rightarrow[S^*] P)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(^*\\) stands for the iteration operator, \\(S^*\\) denoting an arbitrary (finite) number of iterations of program \\(S\\). The axiom expresses that if after any number of iterations of \\(S\\) the truth of \\(P\\) is preserved by the execution of \\(S\\), then, if \\(P\\) is true at the current state, it will also be true after any number of iterations of \\(S\\). A weaker form of PDL, called HML, with only an atomic action box and diamond and propositional connectives, was introduced by Hennessy & Milner to reason about concurrent processes, and in particular analyze process equivalence (Hennessy and Milner 1980).\n\nIt is also worth mentioning here that the work of Dijkstra (1976) on weakest precondition calculus is very much related to dynamic logic (and Hoare\u2019s logic). In fact, what Dijkstra calls the weakest liberal precondition, denoted \\(\\mathbf{wlp}(S,Q)\\), is the same as the box operator in dynamic logic: \\(\\mathbf{wlp}(S,Q) = [S]Q\\), while his weakest precondition, denoted \\(\\mathbf{wp}(S,Q)\\), is the total correctness variant of this, meaning that this expression also entails the termination of statement \\(S\\) (Cousot 1990).\n\nIt was later realized that the application of dynamic logic goes beyond program verification or reasoning about programs. In fact, it constitutes a logic of general action. In Meyer 2000 a number of other applications of dynamic logic are given including deontic logic (see also Meyer 1988), reasoning about database updates, the semantics of reasoning systems such as reflective architectures. As an aside we note here that the use of dynamic logic for deontic logic as proposed in Meyer 1988 needed an extension of the action language, in particular the addition of the \u2018action negation\u2019 operator. The rather controversial nature of this operator triggered work on action negation in itself (see e.g., Broersen 2004). Below we will also encounter the use of dynamic logic in artificial intelligence when specifying intelligent agents.\n\nThe logics thus far are adequate for reasoning about programs that are supposed to terminate and display a certain input/output behavior. However, in the late seventies one came to realize that there are also programs that are not of this kind. Reactive programs are designed to react to input streams that in theory may be infinite, and thus show ideally nonterminating behavior. Not so much input-output behavior is relevant here but rather the behavior of programs over time. Therefore Pnueli (1977) proposed a different way of reasoning about programs for this style of programming based on the idea of a logic of time, viz. (linear-time) temporal logic. (Since reactivity often involves concurrent or parallel programming, temporal logic is often associated with this style of programming. However, it should be noted that a line of research continued to extend the use of Hoare logic to concurrent programs (Lamport 1977, Cousot 1990, de Roever et al. 2001).) Linear-time temporal logic typically has temporal operators such as next-time, always (in the future), sometime (in the future), until and since.\n\nAn interesting difference between temporal logic on the one hand, and dynamic logic and Hoare logic on the other, is that the former is what in the literature is called an endogenous logic, while the latter are so-called exogenous logics. A logic is exogenous if programs are explicit in the logical language, while for endogenous logics this is not the case. In an endogenous logic such as temporal logic the program is assumed to be fixed, and is considered part of the structure over which the logic is interpreted (Harel et al. 2000, 157). Exogenous logics are compositional and have the advantage of allowing analysis by structural induction. Later Pratt (1979b) tried to blend temporal and dynamic logic into what he called process logic, which is an exogenous logic for reasoning about temporal behavior. \n\nAt the moment the field of temporal logic as applied in computer science has developed into a complete subfield on its own, including techniques and tools for (semi-)automatic reasoning and model-checking (cf. Emerson 1990). Also variants of the basic linear-time models have been proposed for verification, such as  branching-time temporal logic (and, in particular the logics CTL (computation tree logic) and its extension CTL* (Emerson 1990), in which one can reason explicitly about (quantification over) alternative paths in nondeterministic computations, and more recently also an extension of CTL, called alternating-time temporal logic (ATL), with a modality expressing that a group of agents has a joint strategy to ensure its argument, to reason about so-called open systems. These are systems, the behavior of which depends also on the behavior of their environments, see Alur et al. 1998.\n\nFinally we mention still alternative logics to reason about programs, viz. fixpoint logics, with as typical example the so-called \\(\\mu\\)-calculus, dating back to Scott and de Bakker (1969), and further developed in Hitchcock and Park 1972, Park 1976, de Bakker 1980, and Meyer 1985. The basic operator is the least fixed point operator \\(\\mu\\), capturing iteration and recursion: if \\(\\phi(X)\\) is a logical expression with a free relation variable \\(X\\), then the expression \\(\\mu X\\phi(X)\\) represents the least \\(X\\) such that \\(\\phi(X) = X\\), if such an \\(X\\) exists. A propositional version of the \\(\\mu\\)-calculus, called propositional or modal \\(\\mu\\)-calculus comprising the propositional constructs \\(\\rightarrow\\) and false, together with the atomic (action) modality [\\(a\\)] and \\(\\mu\\) operator is completely axiomatized by propositional modal logic plus the axiom \\(\\phi[X/\\mu X\\phi] \\rightarrow \\mu X\\phi\\), where \\(\\phi[X/Y\\)] stands for the expression \\(\\phi\\) in which \\(X\\) is substituted by \\(Y\\), and rule\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\phi[X/\\psi] \\rightarrow \\psi}\n     {\\left\\{\\mu X\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi \\right\\}}\n\\]\n\n\n(Kozen 1983, Bradfield and Stirling 2007). This logic is known to subsume PDL (cf. Harel et al. 2000).\n",
