    "main_text": "Health || Embedded Instrumentalism\n6. Conclusions\n\nNaturalism and constructivism have been distinguished for analytic\npurposes in this essay but they are not always easy to tell apart in\npractice. The difficulty comes from the fact that there is widespread\nagreement that our thinking about disease pays attention to both human\nvalues and biological phenomena, and it is not always easy to tell how\na theorist explains the interactions of these factors, nor whether a\ngiven analysis is descriptive or prescriptive. For naturalists the\nrelevant biological processes are departures from good human\nfunctioning, construed in one of several ways about which controversy\nrages, but to be determined by the relevant science. These biological\nproblems result in what we judge to be difficulties in living, which\nmay or may not be partly constitutive of disease, just as positive\nqualities may or may not be partly constitutive of health. For a\nconstructivist, it is the problems people face in their lives that\ntake priority. Their biological underpinnings are ones we count as\nabnormal because we have judged them to be both relevant to the\nconditions we disvalue and also the subject matter of a specific,\nmedical, class of interventions, therapies and other practices. The\nobstacle to a successful development of naturalism is the problem of\nestablishing a satisfactory, science-based, distinction between normal\nand abnormal human functioning. Overcoming this difficulty will\nrequire a closer engagement by theorists of disease with the relevant\ndebates in the philosophy of biology.\n\nFor constructivists, the big problem is to say why we judge some human\nphenomena to be symptoms of disease whereas others are taken as\nevidence that someone is criminal or ugly or possessed by demons or\nsomething else we do not admire. It is not generally true that we\nthink that if someone\u2019s life goes badly it is because he or she is\nunhealthy, so constructivists owe us an account of what makes a\ncertain class of judgments distinctively medicalized. \n",
