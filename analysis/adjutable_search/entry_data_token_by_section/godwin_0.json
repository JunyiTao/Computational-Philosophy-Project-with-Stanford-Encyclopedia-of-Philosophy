    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nGodwin was born on 3 March 1756 at Wisbeach [now Wisbech],\nCambridgeshire, the seventh of thirteen children of John Godwin\n(1723\u20131772) a dissenting minister, and his wife Anne\n(c1723\u20131809), the daughter of Richard Hull, a ship-owner engaged\nin the Baltic trade. As a minister Godwin\u2019s father was involved\nin a number of conflicts with his congregations and the family moved\nfirst from Wisbeach to Debenham, Suffolk and, in 1760 to Guestwick,\nnear Norwich, Norfolk, where they lived until his father\u2019s\ndeath. The village was small and the revenue poor; to supplement their\nincome they took in pupils to whom John Godwin taught the\nclassics. The family\u2019s financial circumstances improved on the\ndeath of Edward Godwin (1695\u20131764), Godwin\u2019s paternal\ngrandfather\u2014also a dissenting minister and friend of Philip\nDoddridge, in whose Academy Godwin\u2019s father and his uncle Edward\nhad been educated.  Godwin\u2019s upbringing was rather gloomy. He\nwas not a robust child and his aunt \u201cinstructed me to compose\nmyself in sleep, with a temper as if I were never again to wake in\nthis sublunary world\u201d (\u201cAutobiography\u201d\nin Collected Novels and Memoirs (CNM hereafter),\n1992, I, 12). At five he was reading The Pilgrim\u2019s\nProgress with her, together with James\nJaneway\u2019s Account of the Conversion, holy and exemplary\nlives and joyful deaths of several young children (1671\u20132),\nand hymns, catechisms and prayers written by Dr. Isaac Watts. One of\nGodwin\u2019s earliest memories was of composing a poem entitled\n\u201cI wish to be a minister\u201d (CNM I, 15), and a\nfavourite childhood entertainment was to preach sermons in the kitchen\non Sunday afternoons.\n\nHe was first educated by a Mrs. Gedge, an elderly woman, \u201cmuch\noccupied in the concerns of religion\u201d, with whom he read the Old\nand New Testaments. After her death in 1764, he and his brother went\nto Mr. Akers\u2019 school in Hilderston (now Hindolverston). Godwin\nremained a religious enthusiast and dissenter\u2014preaching to his\nfellow schoolchildren, identifying some as \u201cchildren of the\ndevil\u201d, and refusing to answer questions on the Collect of the\nweek, taken from the Book of Common Prayer (CNM I,\n24). His success at Akers\u2019 reinforced his commitment to\nintellectual activity and his aversion to physical toil, and\ncompounded his pride, for which he was frequently admonished by his\nfather. Despite his father\u2019s opposition, his resolution to\nbecome a minister never wavered, and in 1767 he went to board with a\nMr. Samuel Newton, the minister of an independent congregation in\nNorwich.\n\nNewton was deeply influenced by the writings of Robert Sandeman\n(1718\u20131771), a hyper-Calvinist who, scorned faith and presented\nGod as saving or damning a person solely \u201caccording to the right\nor wrong judgment of the understanding\u201d (CNM I, 30).\nGodwin compared Newton in his Autobiography to Caligula or Nero for\nhis spiteful and violent treatment, and he left him in the early\nsummer of 1770, having abandoned his calling and decided to become a\nbookseller. Six months at Hindolverston persuaded him to resume his\npupillage for a further, final year, after which he was pronounced fit\nfor entry into the Dissenting College at Homerton and discharged.\nHomerton turned him down \u201con suspicion of Sandemanianism\u201d\n(CNM I, 41). The more tolerant Hoxton Academy, principally\nrun by Andrew Kippis and Abraham Rees admitted him. Hoxton was noted\nfor its Arminianism and Arianism (that is, for the belief that Divine\nsovereignty was compatible with free will in man and for the rejection\nof the divinity of Christ), but Godwin\u2019s Sandemanianism remained\nstubbornly untouched, although he supplemented it with \u201ca creed\nupon materialism and immaterialism, liberty and necessity, in which no\nsubsequent improvement of my understanding has been able to produce\nany variation\u201d (CNM I, 42). In June 1778 he set out to\npractice his vocation. He had a brief appointment in Ware, followed by\na period in London, apparently without income, before obtaining a post\nin 1780 at Stowmarket, Suffolk. He held the post for two years, during\nwhich time his religious beliefs underwent a revolution, moving\ntowards deism after he followed the suggestion of one of his\nparishioners and read Holbach, Helvetius and Rousseau. Not\nsurprisingly, he fell into dispute with his congregation and moved to\nLondon in 1782 where friends encouraged him to write for his\nliving.\n\nLater that year he completed his first work, The history of the\nLife of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham (1783), and by the\nfollowing year was contributing to the English Review,\n\u201cat two guineas a sheet\u201d. At the end of 1782 he returned\nbriefly to his original profession, being employed at Beaconsfield in\nBuckinghamshire for seven months, during which he produced a volume of\nsermons, Sketches of History (1783). When this appointment\nbroke down he returned to London and resumed his career as an\nauthor.\n\nGodwin\u2019s output between 1782 and 1784 included, in addition to\nhis Life of Chatham and his sermons, three novels, two\npolitical pamphlets, a work on education, and a spoof of the critical\nreviews. None made him much money and it was only when his former\ntutor, Andrew Kippis, invited him to write the British and Foreign\nHistory section for the New Annual Register, in July 1784,\nthat he was assured of an adequate income. He probably also made some\nmoney from the pieces he wrote in 1785 for the Political\nHerald, a Whig journal, edited by Dr. Gilbert Stuart. The\npamphlets, and his pieces for the Political Herald, reveal\nhim to be an extremely well informed commentator on contemporary\naffairs. Between 1785 and 1793 Godwin published little save his work\nfor the New Annual Register. Nonetheless, in the summer of\n1791, at the height of the debate on the French Revolution, sparked by\nEdmund Burke\u2019s Reflections on the Revolution in France\n(1790), he persuaded his publisher, George Robinson, to support him\nwhile he wrote a work summarising recent developments in political\nphilosophy. The work grew from its original conception and was\neventually published in two volumes in February 1793 as An Enquiry\nConcerning Political Justice. It is was an immediate success and\nremains the founding work of philosophical anarchism. Although Godwin\ndrew on principles canvassed in the Revolution controversy, and on the\nwork of the philosophes, Political Justice was also\npowerfully influenced by Godwin\u2019s Dissenting education and his\ninvolvement in Dissenting circles around Kippis and Timothy and Thomas\nBrand Hollis. His success soon made him a central figure in radical\npolitical and literary circles of London; he become friends with John\nThelwall, Thomas Holcroft, and John Horne Tooke (all of whom were\nindicted for Treason in 1794), he associated with a wide range of\nother established writers such as Elizabeth Inchbald, James\nMackintosh, and Joseph Ritson, and he was sought out by a younger\ngeneration of enthusiasts, including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor\nColeridge and William Hazlitt. In May 1794 Godwin\u2019s most\nsuccessful novel, Things as they are, or The adventures of Caleb\nWilliams was published, adding further to his literary\nreputation, and in the October of that year his shrewd political\npamphlet, Cursory Strictures on the Charge delivered by Lord Chief\nJustice Eyre to the Grand Jury, attacked the case for treason\nconstructed by Eyre against the leaders of the London Corresponding\nSociety and the Society for Constitutional Information, several of\nwhom were his close associates.\n\nA second edition of Godwin\u2019s Political Justice, in\nwhich some of the more rationalist and utopian statements of the first\nedition were modified, was published at the end of 1795. Shortly\nthereafter he became reacquainted with Mary Wollstonecraft, whom he\nhad first met briefly in 1791 at a dinner in honour of Paine at which\nneither was much impressed by the other. Wollstonecraft had\nsubsequently lived in revolutionary France and had had a child in a\nfraught relationship with Captain Gilbert Imlay, an American merchant.\nTheir second introduction was more successful. As a young man Godwin\nhad been very much the philosopher\u2014austere in dress, with an\nangular figure, an intense manner and piercing glance. While\napproachable he was not socially adept: he both took offence easily\nand gave it by his zealous commitment to the virtue of candour among\nfriends. Only with his increasing success did he come to meet a wide\nrange of clever women with political, literary and philosophical\ninterests\u2014such as Helen Maria Williams, Elizabeth Inchbald,\nAmelia Alderson, Maria Reveley, Mary Hays and Mary Robinson. This\ncontact had its effect. He cut his hair short in 1791 and adopted a\nless ministerial style of dress; he also enjoyed an increasingly\nextensive social life (albeit without any indication of\nself-indulgence); and he even experimented in 1796 with holding a\ndinner party (which included Parr\u2019s daughters, Wollstonecraft,\nand Inchbald). He also developed a basic competence in flirtation. In\nthe last months of 1795 and first half of 1796, Reveley, Samuel\nParr\u2019s daughter Sarah, Alderson and Inchbald were all candidates\nfor his attention. Following their re-acquaintance in January 1796,\nWollstonecraft subsequently called on Godwin, unconventionally, in\nApril 1796; thereafter they met and corresponded regularly, and by\nJuly they were much closer, becoming lovers in August 1796. Their\nletters and notes provide a touching record of a philosophical\nrelationship gradually subverted by feelings which Godwin found hard\nto accommodate intellectually and Wollstonecraft found hard to trust.\nWollstonecraft became pregnant in December and after much deliberation\nover how to reconcile their actions to their principles, they married\nin March 1797. Wollstonecraft\u2019s death following childbirth in\nSeptember 1797 left Godwin distraught and burdened with the care of\nboth the baby Mary (later Mary Shelley) and Fanny Imlay\n(Wollstonecraft\u2019s illegitimate child )\u2014and with a growing\nburden of debt. He threw himself into work: he revised Political\nJustice for a third, and final time, wrote a hurried memoir of\nWollstonecraft, prepared a collection of her works, and embarked on\nhis second major novel, St Leon (1799).\nWollstonecraft\u2019s influence on Godwin\u2019s thinking has been\ndetected by critics in his volume of essays, The Enquirer\n(1798), and in the revisions made for the third edition of\nPolitical Justice, published at the end of 1797. A rather\ndifferent sense of their relationship was recorded by him in his\nMemoirs of the Author of the Vindication of the Rights of\nWomen (1798), and in his depiction of marriage in St.\nLeon (1799). The Memoirs provoked a storm of controversy\nby their revelations of Wollstonecraft\u2019s unconventional sexual\nmores. Several of Godwin\u2019s past acquaintances spurned him, he\nfound himself increasingly the subject of attack by loyalist\nnewspapers, and his philosophical opinions were parodied and ridiculed\nin novels, reviews and pamphlets. Godwin reacted with dignity. His\nThoughts Occasioned by the Perusal of Dr. Parr\u2019s Spital\nSermon (1801), sought dispassionately to answer his critics and\nto confess errors which he now recognized\u2014and which had already\nbeen acknowledged both in the revisions to the later editions of his\nEnquiry, and in his comments in St. Leon. But the reply did\nlittle to rescue him from the now overwhelming tide of reaction, and\nincautious remarks in his discussion of Malthus\u2019 Essay on\nthe Principle of Population (1798) about exposing children and\nabortion, were seized upon with glee by the reviewers. Godwin\u2019s\nPolitical Justice was a product of the enthusiasm connected\nwith the French Revolution but by the end of the decade the author and\nhis works were being exuberantly denounced by loyalism and the forces\nof reaction that increasingly dominated the British political and\nliterary scene. Hereafter, for most of the rest of his life, Godwinism\nbecame a term of opprobrium. In the new, intolerant political climate\nGodwin turned to literature and history. He tried his hand at drama\nwith two plays, Antonio (1800) and Faulkener (1807),\nbut with no success; in 1803 he wrote a two volume Life of\nChaucer; and two years later he produced a further novel,\nFleetwood: or The New Man of Feeling (1805). To cope with his\ndomestic responsibilities he looked for a new wife, approaching\nHarriet Lee who found him too pressing, Maria Reveley too soon after\nthe death of her husband, and Sarah Elwes, a woman separated from her\nhusband, who was unable to marry. When a widow with two children, Mary\nJane Clairmont, leaned over her balcony in 1801 and asked \u201cIs it\npossible that I behold the immortal Godwin\u201d, his fate was\nsealed.\n\nIn 1805, in an effort to establish his finances on a more secure\nfooting, his friends helped establish him as the proprietor of a\nchildren\u2019s bookshop. Over the next ten years, writing mainly\nunder the pseudonym Edward Baldwin, Godwin produced a variety of books\nfor children: including collections of fables, myths, and bible\nstories, histories of England, Rome and Greece, and various\ndictionaries and grammars, but he wrote little of any real political\nor philosophical significance for ten years.\n\nIn 1814 Godwin\u2019s domestic life was thrown into turmoil when\nPercy Bysshe Shelley eloped to France with Godwin\u2019s\nseventeen-year-old daughter Mary, accompanied by Mary\u2019s sixteen\nyear old stepsister, Clare Clairmont. The following decade was marked\nby repeated family and financial crises, by the suicides of\nShelley\u2019s first wife, Godwin\u2019s stepdaughter Fanny, and of\nhis young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Patrickson, and by the deaths of three\nof Mary Shelley\u2019s children, followed hard by the death of\nShelley himself in 1822. Yet it was also a productive period for\nGodwin. His Lives of Edward and John Philips, nephews of\nMilton (1815), his chilling tale of madness, Mandeville\n(1817), and his four volume History of the Commonwealth\n(1824\u20138) each represent his fascination with the republicanism\nof the civil war period. He also returned to the subject of education\nin his Letters of Advice to a Young American (1818) and in\n1820 he produced a lengthy critique of Malthus\u2019 Essay,\nwhich won him some respect in some previously hostile quarters,\nalongside the undisguised enmity of the Edinburgh Review. In\nthe last five years of his life he wrote two further novels, and he\nreturned to the philosophical and terrain of his earlier career in his\nThoughts on Man (1831), his most sustained piece of\nphilosophy since his Enquirer (1798). His final work,\nunpublished in his lifetime, was a series of essays on Christianity,\nin which he fulfilled an ambition, first noted in 1798, to \n\n\nsweep away the whole fiction of an intelligent former world and a\nfuture state; to call men off from those incoherent and contradictory\ndreams, that so often occupy their thoughts, and vainly agitate their\nfears; and to lead them to apply their whole energy to practical\nobjects and genuine realities. (Political and Philosophical\nWritings (PPW hereafter) IV, 417) \n\n\nIn 1833 Godwin finally received some recognition when he was given a\nsinecure post by the then Whig government. Peel\u2019s subsequent\nadministration agreed to extend the post until Godwin died in April\n1836.\n",
