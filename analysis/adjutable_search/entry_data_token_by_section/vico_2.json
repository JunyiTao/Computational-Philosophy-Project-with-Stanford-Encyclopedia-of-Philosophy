    "main_text": "Vico\u2019s Early Works\n3. The New Science\n\nMany themes of these early works-language, wisdom, history, truth,\ncausality, philology, rhetoric, philosophy, poetry, and the relative\nstrengths and weaknesses of ancient and modern learning-are\nincorporated into and receive their fullest treatment in Vico\u2019s\nmajor work, The New Science, first published in 1725 (an\nedition subsequently known as the Scienza Nuova Prima or\nFirst New Science) and again in a second and largely\nrewritten version five years later. Vico published a third edition in\n1744, which was later edited by Fausto Nicolini and appeared in 1928.\nNicoloni is responsible for updating Vico\u2019s punctuation and\nbreaking the work up into its current structure of chapters, sections,\nand numbered paragraphs (1112 in all), not originally supplied by Vico\nhimself, which have been reproduced in many though not all subsequent\neditions. Nicolini referred to his edition as the Scienza Nuova\nseconda-Second New Science (or simply The New\nScience), under which title the definitive version is known\ntoday. \n\nThe text consists of an overview (\u201cIdea of the Work\u201d)\ncouched as an explication of a frontispiece depicting a female figure\n(Metaphysics), standing on a globe of the Earth and contemplating a\nluminous triangle containing the eye of God, or Providence. Below\nstands a statue of Homer representing the origins of human society in\n\u201cpoetic wisdom.\u201d This is followed by five Books and a\nConclusion, the first of which (\u201cEstablishment of\nPrinciples\u201d) establishes the method upon which Vico constructs a\nhistory of civil society from its earliest beginnings in the state of\nnature (stato di natura) to its contemporary manifestation in\nseventeenth century Europe.\n\nIn the work, Vico consciously develops his notion of scienza\n(science or knowledge) in opposition to the then dominant philosophy\nof Descartes with its emphasis on clear and distinct ideas, the most\nsimple elements of thought from which all knowledge, the Cartesians\nheld, could be derived a priori by way of deductive rules. As Vico had\nalready argued, one consequence and drawback of this\nhypothetico-deductive method is that it renders phenomena which cannot\nbe expressed logically or mathematically as illusions of one sort or\nanother. This applies not only most obviously to the data of sense and\npsychological experience, but also to the non-quantifiable evidence\nthat makes up the human sciences. Drawing on the verum factum\nprinciple first described in De Antiquissima, Vico argues\nagainst Cartesian philosophy that full knowledge of any thing involves\ndiscovering how it came to be what it is as a product of\nhuman action and the \u201cprincipal property\u201d of human beings,\nviz., \u201cof being social\u201d (\u201cIdea of the Work,\u201d\n\u00a72,\n p.3).[7]\n The reduction of all facts to the ostensibly paradigmatic form of\nmathematical knowledge is a form of \u201cconceit,\u201d Vico\nmaintains, which arises from the fact that \u201cman makes himself\nthe measure of all things\u201d (Element I, \u00a7120, p.60) and that\n\u201cwhenever men can form no idea of distant and unknown things,\nthey judge them by what is familiar and at hand\u201d (Element II,\n\u00a7122, p.60). Recognizing this limitation, Vico argues, is at once\nto grasp that phenomena can only be known via their origins, or per\ncaussas (through causes). For \u201cDoctrines must take their\nbeginning from that of the matters of which they treat\u201d (Element\nCVI, \u00a7314, p.92), he says, and it is one \u201cgreat labor\nof...Science to recover...[the] grounds of truth-truth which, with the\npassage of years and the changes in language and customs, has come\ndown to us enveloped in falsehood\u201d (Element XVI, \u00a7150,\npp.64\u20135). Unveiling this falsehood leads to\n\u201cwisdom,\u201d which is \u201cnothing but the science of\nmaking such use of things as their nature dictates\u201d (Element\nCXIV, \u00a7326, p.94). Given that verum ipsum\nfactum-\u201cthe true is the made,\u201d or something is true\nbecause it is made-scienzia both sets knowledge per\ncaussas as its task and as the method for attaining it; or, expressed\nin other terms, the content of scienza is identical with the\ndevelopment of that scienza itself.\n\nThe challenge, however, is to develop this science in such a way as to\nunderstand the facts of the human world without either reducing them\nto mere contingency or explaining their order by way of speculative\nprinciples of the sort generated by traditional metaphysics. They must\nbe rendered intelligible, that is, without reducing them, as did the\nCartesians, to the status of ephemera. Vico satisfies this demand by\ndistinguishing at the outset of The New Science between\nil vero and il certo, \u201cthe true\u201d and\n\u201cthe certain.\u201d The former is the object of knowledge\n(scienza) since it is universal and eternal, whereas the\nlatter, related as it is to human consciousness (coscienza),\nis particular and individuated. This produces two pairs of\nterms-il vero/scienza and il\ncerto/coscienza-which constitute, in turn, the\nexplananda of philosophy and philology (\u201chistory\u201d broadly\nconceived), respectively. As Vico says, \u201cphilosophy contemplates\nreason, whence comes knowledge of the true; philology observes that of\nwhich human choice is author, whence comes consciousness of the\ncertain\u201d (Element X, \u00a7138, p.63). These two disciplines\ncombine in a method or \u201cnew critical art\u201d\n(nuova\u2019arte critica) where philosophy aims at\narticulating the universal forms of intelligibility common to all\nexperience, while philology adumbrates the empirical phenomena of the\nworld which arise from human choice: the languages, customs, and\nactions of people which make up civil society. Understood as mutually\nexclusive disciplines-a tendency evident, according to Vico, in the\nhistory of philosophy up to his time-philosophy and philology appear\nas empty and abstract (as in the rational certainty of Cartesian\nmetaphysics) and merely empirical and contingent, respectively. Once\ncombined, however, they form a doctrine which yields a full knowledge\nof facts where \u201cknowledge\u201d in the Vichean sense means to\nhave grasped both the necessity of human affairs (manifest in the\ncausal connections between otherwise random events) and the\ncontingency of the events which form the content of the causal chains.\nPhilosophy yields the universally true and philology the individually\ncertain.\n\nThe text of The New Science then constitutes Vico\u2019s\nattempt to develop a method which itself comes to be in the course of\napplying it to human experience, and this takes the form of a history\nof civil society and its development through the progress of war and\npeace, law, social order, commerce, and government. \u201cThus our\nScience,\u201d Vico says near the beginning of the work, \u201ccomes\nto be at once a history of the ideas, the customs, the deeds of\nmankind. From these three we shall derive the principles of the\nhistory of human nature, which we shall show to be the principles of\nuniversal history, which principles it seems hitherto to have\nlacked\u201d (\u201cPoetic Wisdom,\u201d \u00a7368, p.112).\nAccomplishing this task involves tracing human society back to its\norigins in order to reveal a common human nature and a genetic,\nuniversal pattern through which all nations run. Vico sees this common\nnature reflected in language, conceived as a store-house of customs,\nin which the wisdom of successive ages accumulates and is presupposed\nin the form of a sensus communis or \u201cmental\ndictionary\u201d by subsequent generations. Vico defines this common\nsense as \u201cjudgment without reflection, shared by an entire\nclass, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human\nrace\u201d (Element XII, \u00a7145, pp.63\u20134). It is also\navailable to the philosopher who, by deciphering and thus recovering\nits content, can discover an \u201cideal eternal history traversed in\ntime by the histories of all nations\u201d (Proposition XLII,\n\u00a7114, p.57).\n\nThe result of this, in Vico\u2019s view, is to appreciate history as\nat once \u201cideal\u201d-since it is never perfectly actualized-and\n\u201ceternal,\u201d because it reflects the presence of a divine\norder or Providence guiding the development of human institutions.\nNations need not develop at the same pace-less developed ones can and\ndo coexist with those in a more advanced phase-but they all pass\nthrough the same distinct stages (corsi): the ages of gods,\nheroes, and men. Nations \u201cdevelop in conformity to this\ndivision,\u201d Vico says, \u201cby a constant and uninterrupted\norder of causes and effects present in every nation\u201d (\u201cThe\nCourse the Nations Run,\u201d \u00a7915, p.335). Each stage, and thus\nthe history of any nation, is characterized by the manifestation of\nnatural law peculiar to it, and the distinct languages (signs,\nmetaphors, and words), governments (divine, aristocratic\ncommonwealths, and popular commonwealths and monarchies), as well as\nsystems of jurisprudence (mystic theology, heroic jurisprudence, and\nthe natural equity of free commonwealths) that define them.\n\nIn addition to specifying the distinct stages through which social,\ncivil, and political order develops, Vico draws on his earlier\nwritings to trace the origin of nations back to two distinct features\nof human nature: the ages of gods and heroes result from memory and\ncreative acts of \u201cimagination\u201d (fantasia), while\nthe age of men stems from the faculty of \u201creflection\u201d\n(riflessione). Vico thus claims to have discovered two kinds\nof wisdom-\u201cpoetic\u201d and\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d-corresponding to the dual nature of human\nbeings (sense and intellect), represented in the creations of\ntheological poets and philosophers, respectively (\u201cPoetic\nWisdom,\u201d \u00a7779, p.297). Institutions arise first from the\nimmediacy of sense-experience, pure feeling, curiosity, wonder, fear,\nsuperstition, and the child-like capacity of human beings to imitate\nand anthropomorphize the world around them. Since \u201cin the\nworld\u2019s childhood men were by nature sublime poets\u201d\n(Element XXXVII, \u00a7187, p.71), Vico reasons, nations must be\n\u201cpoetic in their beginnings\u201d (Element XLIV, \u00a7200,\np.73), so that their origin and course can be discovered by recreating\nor remembering the \u201cpoetic\u201d or \u201cmetaphysical\ntruth\u201d which underlies them (Element XLVII, \u00a7205, p.74).\nThis is manifest primarily in fable, myth, the structure of early\nlanguages, and the formations of polytheistic religion. The belief\nsystems of early societies are thus characterized by \u201cpoetic\nmetaphysics\u201d which \u201cseeks its proofs not in the external\nworld but within the modifications of the mind of him who meditates\nit\u201d (\u201cPoetic Wisdom,\u201d \u00a7374, p.116), and\n\u201cpoetic logic,\u201d through which the creations of this\nmetaphysics are signified. Metaphysics of this sort is \u201cnot\nrational and abstract like that of learned men now,\u201d Vico\nemphasizes, \u201cbut felt and imagined [by men] without power of\nratiocination...This metaphysics was their poetry, a faculty born with\nthem...born of their ignorance of causes, for ignorance, the mother of\nwonder, made everything wonderful to men who were ignorant of\neverything\u201d (\u201cPoetic Wisdom,\u201d \u00a7375, p.116).\nIncapable of forming \u201cintelligible class concepts of\nthings\u201d-a feature of human mind realized only in the age of\nmen-people \u201chad a natural need to create poetic characters; that\nis, imaginative class concepts or universals, to which, as to certain\nmodels or ideal portraits, to reduce all the particular species which\nresembled them\u201d (Element XLIX, \u00a7209, p.74).\n\nFrom this genus of poetic metaphysics, Vico then extrapolates the\nvarious species of wisdom born of it. \u201cPoetic morals\u201d have\ntheir source in piety and shame (\u201cPoetic Wisdom,\u201d\n\u00a7502, p.170), he argues, while \u201cpoetic economy\u201d\narises from the feral equality of human beings and the family\nrelationships into which they were forced by need (\u201cPoetic\nWisdom,\u201d \u00a7523, p.180). Similarly, \u201cpoetic\ncosmography\u201d grows from the seeing \u201cthe world as composed\nof gods of the sky, of the underworld...and gods intermediate between\nearth and sky\u201d (\u201cPoetic Wisdom,\u201d \u00a7710, p.269),\n\u201cpoetic astronomy\u201d from raising the gods \u201cto the\nplanets and [assigning] the heroes to the constellations\u201d\n(\u201cPoetic Wisdom,\u201d \u00a7728, p.277), \u201cpoetic\nchronology\u201d out of the cycles of harvest and the seasons\n(\u201cPoetic Wisdom,\u201d \u00a7732, p.279), and \u201cpoetic\ngeography\u201d from naming the natural world through \u201cthe\nsemblances of things known or near at hand\u201d (\u201cPoetic\nWisdom,\u201d \u00a7741, p.285). As the faculty of reason develops\nand grows, however, the power of imagination from which the earliest\nforms of human society grew weakens and gives way finally to the power\nof reflection; the cognitive powers of human beings gain ascendance\nover their creative capacity, and reason replaces poetry as the\nprimary way of understanding the world. This defines the age of men\nwhich makes philosophy, Vico reasons, a relatively recent development\nin history, appearing as it did \u201csome two thousand years after\nthe gentile nations were founded\u201d (Element CV, \u00a7313,\np.92).\n\nSince history itself, in Vico\u2019s view, is the manifestation of\nProvidence in the world, the transition from one stage to the next and\nthe steady ascendance of reason over imagination represent a gradual\nprogress of civilization, a qualitative improvement from simpler to\nmore complex forms of social organization. Vico characterizes this\nmovement as a \u201cnecessity of nature\u201d (\u201cIdea of the\nWork,\u201d \u00a734, p.21) which means that, with the passage of\ntime, human beings and societies tend increasingly towards realizing\ntheir full potential. From rude beginnings undirected passion is\ntransformed into virtue, the bestial state of early society is\nsubordinated to the rule of law, and philosophy replaces sentiments of\nreligion. \u201cOut of ferocity, avarice, and ambition, the three\nvices which run throughout the human race,\u201d Vico says,\n\u201clegislation creates the military, merchant, and governing\nclasses, and thus the strength, riches, and wisdom of commonwealths.\nOut of these three great vices, which could certainly destroy all\nmankind on the face of the earth, it makes civil happiness\u201d\n(Element VII, \u00a7132, p.62). In addition, the transition from\npoetic to rational consciousness enables reflective individuals-the\nphilosopher, that is, in the shape of Vico-to recover the body of\nuniversal history from the particularity of apparently random events.\nThis is a fact attested to by the form and content of The New\nScience itself.\n\nAlthough from a general point of view history reveals a progress of\ncivilization through actualizing the potential of human nature, Vico\nalso emphasizes the cyclical feature of historical development.\nSociety progresses towards perfection, but without reaching it (thus\nhistory is \u201cideal\u201d), interrupted as it is by a break or\nreturn (ricorso) to a relatively more primitive condition.\nOut of this reversal, history begins its course anew, albeit from the\nirreversibly higher point to which it has already attained. Vico\nobserves that in the latter part of the age of men (manifest in the\ninstitutions and customs of medieval feudalism) the\n\u201cbarbarism\u201d which marks the first stages of civil society\nreturns as a \u201ccivil disease\u201d to corrupt the body politic\nfrom within. This development is marked by the decline of popular\ncommonwealths into bureaucratic monarchies, and, by the force of\nunrestrained passions, the return of corrupt manners which had\ncharacterized the earlier societies of gods and heroes. Out of this\n\u201csecond barbarism,\u201d however, either through the appearance\nof wise legislators, the rise of the fittest, or a the last vestiges\nof civilization, society returns to the \u201cprimitive simplicity of\nthe first world of peoples,\u201d and individuals are again\n\u201creligious, truthful, and faithful\u201d (\u201cConclusion of\nthe Work,\u201d \u00a71104\u20131106, pp.423\u20134). From this\nbegins a new corso which Vico saw manifest in his own time as\nthe \u201csecond age of men\u201d characterized by the\n\u201ctrue\u201d Christian religion and the monarchical government\nof seventeenth century Europe.\n\nIn addition to his account of the origins and history of civil society\ndeveloped in The New Science, Vico also advances a highly\noriginal thesis about the origin and character of Homeric poetry,\nwhich he refers to as \u201cThe Discovery of the New Homer.\u201d\nVico observes that the \u201cvulgar feelings and vulgar customs\nprovide the poets with their proper materials\u201d (\u201cDiscovery\nof the True Homer,\u201d \u00a7781, p.301), and, given that in the\nage of heroes these customs constituted a \u201csavage\u201d and\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d state of human nature, the poetry of Homer\ncannot be the esoteric wisdom or creative act of a single individual,\nas scholars have assumed, but represents the imaginative universals of\nthe Greek people themselves. Homeric poetry thus contains the\n\u201cmodels or ideal portraits\u201d which form the mental\ndictionary of the Ancients, and explains the place Vico assigns to\nHomer in the frontispiece where his statue represents the origins of\nhuman society in poetic wisdom. Vico thus applies his doctrine of the\nimaginative universal to the case of Homer and concludes that though\nit \u201cmarks a famous epoch in history it never in the world took\nplace.\u201d The historical Homer was \u201cquite simply a man of\nthe people\u201d (\u201cDiscovery of the True Homer, \u00a7806,\np.308) and quite distinct from the ostensible author of the Odyssey\nand Iliad who was actually a \u201dpurely ideal poet who never\nexisted in the world of nature...but was an idea or a heroic character\nof Grecian men insofar as they told their histories in song\u201c\n(\u201dDiscovery of the True Homer, \u00a7873, p.323).\n",
