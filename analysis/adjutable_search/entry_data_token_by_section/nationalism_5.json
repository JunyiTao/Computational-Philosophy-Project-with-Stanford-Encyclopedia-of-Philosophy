    "main_text": "The Moral Debate || Arguments in favor of nationalism, classical vs. liberal: the deep need for community\n3.2 Arguments in favor of nationalism, classical vs. liberal: the deep need for community\n\nConsider now the particular pro-nationalist arguments from the first\nset. The first argument depends on assumptions that also appear in the\nsubsequent ones, but it further ascribes to the community an intrinsic\nvalue. The later arguments point more towards an instrumental value of\nnation, derived from the value of individual flourishing, moral\nunderstanding, firm identity and the like.\n\n The Argument From Intrinsic Value. Each ethno-national\ncommunity is valuable in and of itself since it is only within the\nnatural encompassing framework of various cultural traditions that\nimportant meanings and values are produced and transmitted. The\nmembers of such communities share a special cultural proximity to each\nother. By speaking the same language and sharing customs and\ntraditions, the members of these communities are typically closer to\none another in various ways than they are to the outsiders.\n The Argument from Flourishing. The ethno-national\ncommunity is essential for each of its members to flourish. In\nparticular, it is only within such a community that an individual can\nacquire concepts and values crucial for understanding the\ncommunity\u2019s cultural life in general and the individual\u2019s\nown life in particular. There has been much debate on the\npro-nationalist side about whether divergence of values is essential\nfor separateness of national groups.\n\n\nThe Canadian liberal nationalists Seymour (1999), Taylor, and Kymlicka\npointed out that \u201cdivergences of value between different regions\nof Canada\u201d that aspire to separate nationhood are\n\u201cminimal\u201d. Taylor (1993: 155) concluded that it is not\nseparateness of value that matters.\n\n The Argument from Identity. Communitarian philosophers\nemphasize nurture over nature as the principal force determining our\nidentity as people\u2014we come to be who we are because of the\nsocial settings and contexts in which we mature. This claim certainly\nhas some plausibility. The very identity of each person depends upon\nhis/her participation in communal life (see MacIntyre 1994, Nielsen,\n1998, and Lagerspetz 2000). Given that an individual\u2019s morality\ndepends upon their having a mature and stable personal identity, the\ncommunal conditions that foster the development of personal identity\nmust be preserved and encouraged. Therefore, communal life should be\norganized around particular national cultures.\n The Argument from Moral Understanding. A particularly\nimportant variety of value is moral value. Some values are universal,\ne.g., freedom and equality, but these are too abstract and\n\u201cthin\u201d. The rich, \u201cthick\u201d moral values are\ndiscernible only within particular traditions; as Charles Taylor puts\nit, \u201cthe language we have come to accept articulates the issues\nof the good for us\u201d (1989: 35). The nation offers a natural\nframework for moral traditions, and thereby for moral understanding;\nit is the primary school of morals.\n The Argument from Diversity. Each national culture\ncontributes uniquely to the diversity of human cultures. The most\nfamous twentieth century proponent of the idea, Isaiah Berlin\n(interpreting Herder), writes:\n\n\n\nThe \u2018physiognomies\u2019 of cultures are unique: each presents\na wonderful exfoliation of human potentialities in its own time and\nplace and environment. We are forbidden to make judgments of\ncomparative value, for that is measuring the incommensurable. (1976:\n206)\n \n\n\nAssuming that the (ethno-)nation is the natural unit of culture, the\npreservation of cultural diversity amounts to institutionally\nprotecting the purity of (ethno-)national culture. The plurality of\ncultural styles can be preserved and enhanced by tying them to\nethno-national \u201cforms of life\u201d.\n David Miller has developed an interesting and sophisticated\nliberal pro-national stance over the course of decades from his work\nin 1990 to the most recent work in 2013. He accepts multicultural\ndiversity within a society but stresses an overarching national\nidentity, taking as his prime example British national identity, which\nencompasses the English, Scottish, and other ethnic identities. He\ndemands an \u201cinclusive identity, accessible to members of all\ncultural groups\u201d (2013: 91). miller claims such identity is\nnecessary for basic social solidarity, and it goes far beyond simple\nconstitutional patriotism. A skeptic could note the following. The\nproblem with multicultural society is that national identity has\nhistorically been a matter of ethno-national ties and has required\nsameness in the weighted majority of cultural traits (common language,\ncommon \u201chistory-as-remembered\u201d, customs, religion and so\non). However, multi-cultural states typically bring together groups\nwith very different histories, languages, religions, and even quite\ncontrasting appearances. Now, how is the overarching \u201cnational\nidentity\u201d to be achieved starting from the very thin identity of\ncommon belonging to a state? One seems to have a dilemma. Grounding\nsocial solidarity in national identity requires the latter to be\nrather thin and seems likely to end up as full-on, unitary cultural\nidentity. Thick constitutional patriotism may be one interesting\npossible attitude that can ground such solidarity while preserving the\noriginal cultural diversity.\n",
