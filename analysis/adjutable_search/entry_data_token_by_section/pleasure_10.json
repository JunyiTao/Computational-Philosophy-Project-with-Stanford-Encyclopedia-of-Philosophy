    "main_text": "Pleasure, Motivation, and the Brain || Is Pleasure\u2019s Goodness Independent of Motivation?\n3.2 Is Pleasure\u2019s Goodness Independent of Motivation?\n\nOn the other hand, if there is no close connection between pleasure\nand motivation, why pleasure should be more likely to become an object\nof pursuit rather than of avoidance or indifference seems mysterious.\nNatural selection may explain why animals that already pursue\npleasure and avoid pain should come to enjoy foods that are nutritious\nand to feel pain when they begin to be injured. But it\u2019s not\nclear how it could explain why animals pursue pleasure and avoid pain\nrather than the other way around. Philosophers are well acquainted\nwith the problem of evil in a world created by an all-knowing,\nall-powerful and all-good God or in any similarly good-directed\nteleological order. It\u2019s hard to explain why there should be any\nevil in such a world. But on a completely nonteleological view of\nnature it seems as hard to see why animals especially pursue their own\nor any good (cf. Plato, Phaedo 97B8\u201399C6). Both\nproblems depend on our having an independent grasp of the relevant\nnormative notions. If evil were just whatever God won\u2019t will,\nand an animal\u2019s good or pleasure were just whatever it tends\ntoward or has been naturally selected to pursue, both puzzles would\ndissolve.\n\nThis Problem of Good was, in the past century, raised specifically\nagainst views akin to the simple picture of pleasure, on which\npleasure is valuable by virtue of its intrinsic nature, perhaps just\nbecause of the way it feels in its moment, and independently of our or\nother animals\u2019 actually desiring or pursuing it. It was argued\nthat such a picture of pleasure leaves our pursuit of pleasure an\napparently miraculous conicidence crying out for explanation. This was\nurged not in favor of theology or teleology, but rather in arguing\nthat pleasure must be connected to animal impulse or desire by its\nvery nature (Alston 1967, pp.\u00a0345\u201346; Findlay 1961,\npp.\u00a0175\u201378; McDougall, 1911, pp.\u00a0324\u201325.) It may\nhelp to see this puzzle as a human counterpart of Socrates\u2019\nquestion to Euthyphro, about which comes logically first, the\nrighteousness of pious acts or Divine love of them (Plato,\nEuthyphro, 6E11\u201311B1). Which comes logically first,\nhedonic value or motivation? Perhaps science, by revealing the\nconstitution of pleasure and of its enmeshment with motivation, will\ntell us which of these answers to give to this human Euthyphro\nquestion or else will suggest some third way out. Some value hedonists\nare inclined to answer that we and other animals simply respond to\npleasure\u2019s value by rationally apprehending, and accordingly\npursuing, it (Goldstein 1980, 1989, 2002). While ancients and\nmedievals inhabiting a teleological worldview (on which attraction\ntoward the good required no further explanation) could answer thus, to\nthat extent, it seems, they faced no Problem of Good, which arises to\nthe extent one abandons unexplained teleology. In principle, however,\nnondebunking explanations seem possible. For example, perhaps brute\nidentity or natural relations of pleasure and pain with good and bad\nnutritional or metabolic states provided a basis for natural\nselection, starting from feelings of energy and fatigue representing\nonly themselves, to enable these to progressively connect with and\nrepresent more, and then entangled these representations with\nmotivational reward systems, resulting in the biology discussed in the\nnext section.\n",
