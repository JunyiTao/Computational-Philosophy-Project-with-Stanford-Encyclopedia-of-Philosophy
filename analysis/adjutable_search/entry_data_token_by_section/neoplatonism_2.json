    "main_text": "Absolute Consciousness\n3. Absolute Consciousness\nIn accordance with the Platonic-Aristotelian commitment to Mind\nover Matter the Neoplatonists\u2019 answer to this question was that\nthe outer activity and effect of the First must be nous, a\ndifficult and ambiguous concept commonly translated as\n\u201cIntellect\u201d. It seems preferable to translate the term\nnous in an experientially more concrete and accessible way as\npure and absolute \u201cConsciousness\u201d. According to\nNeoplatonic theory, Consciousness would not be some kind of emergent\nproperty of material constituents arranged in a certain way, but\nrather be the first effect of the activity of the One, the most\nsupreme form of reality (since the One was posited to be beyond\nBeing), a kind of pre-embodied power of cognition as\nsuch. Neoplatonists referred to Consciousness as the second\n\u201cHypostasis\u201d, a term that would have a long and complex\nhistory as it acquired new and related meanings in Christian\ncontexts. \u201cHypostasis\u201d is an abstract noun derived from a\nverb meaning \u201cto place oneself under or beneath\u201d, with the\nconnotation of \u201cstanding one\u2019s ground\u201d. The word\n\u201chypostasis\u201d therefore denotes a distinct substantial\nbeing or realm of reality of a certain kind which, in the case of\nConsciousness, is the derivative outer activity of the first\nprinciple. The term could also be applied to the One as the\n\u201cfirst hypostasis\u201d, in which case the connotation of\nsubordination would recede into the background.\nWhat, then, is the inner activity of Consciousness? The inherent\ntask of consciousness is to understand, and understanding entails the\ncognition of causes. In trying to understand itself, Consciousness can\nonly turn towards its origin and thus posit or behold the\nFirst as the transcendent principle of its own reality. As the\nNeoplatonists would put it, having emerged from the First,\nConsciousness \u201cturns back\u201d towards it in order to\nunderstand the pre-condition of its own existence. Becoming thus aware\nof another entity, the originary unity of Consciousness breaks up into\nduality, and with it emerge the categories of identity and difference,\nof greater and smaller, of number, of change and of rest. In fact, in\na way not fully explained, or perhaps even explicable, the entire\nideal world of Platonic forms and ideas emerges effortlessly in the\ncourse of Consciousness\u2019 effort to understand itself.\nBefore we move on to discuss the outer effect of this inner\nactivity of Consciousness, we must correct the common assertion that\nwhat we are dealing with here is a process of\n\u201cemanation\u201d. To be sure, Consciousness (or Intellect)\nsomehow emerges from the activity of the First, but calling this a\nprocess of emanation, with its obviously materialist connotations, is\nmisleading. The Neoplatonists used the words \u201cprocession and\nreturn\u201d (prohodos and epistroph\u00ea),\nwhich, as spatial metaphors, are not much better either. And even\nthough the analogy oftentimes invoked in this context is that of light\nradiating out from the sun, this too does not do much to help us grasp\nthe nature of the Neoplatonic theory of how Consciousness, and by\nimplication the entire rest of reality, eternally emerges from the\nfirst cause. In essence, there is no process of generation or\nproduction; nothing material or spatial is happening; no agent exerts\nits influence on a patient. Although the Neoplatonists followed\nPlatonic tradition in talking about a demiurge (divine craftsman),\ntheir cosmology has nothing demiurgic about it, as Plotinus rarely\nfailed to point out. Craftsmen think, forge, labor, arrange, and\ncoordinate a host of diverse technical operations towards the creation\nof some product of their craft. Unlike Plato\u2019s character Timaeus\nor the authors of Genesis, Neoplatonic metaphysics has no room for\nsuch crude analogies. In the realm of Consciousness, the activity is\none and constitutes itself as a multiplicity within that unity. In the\nidentity of the activity of thought with its objects, the\nNeoplatonists contended, the ideal world of all forms and ideas came\nto be conceptualized. Here again, in an unintentional and effortless\nway, this inner active life of Consciousness produces further outer\neffect, the Soul.\n",
