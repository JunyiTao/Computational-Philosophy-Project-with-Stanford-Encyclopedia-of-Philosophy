    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy in Al-Andalus developed later than in the East; it grew\namong Muslims and Jews, since both communities were nurtured by a\ncommon Arabic. The Muslim community was much larger and it defined the\ncultural space, a significant part of which was made by Arabic\ntranslations of Greek scientifical and philosophical works.\n\nThe earliest Arab philosopher al-Kindi (d. c. 853) was possibly known\nin Al-Andalus by Ibn Masarra (d. 931) since he criticized his views\n(Bellver 2020), and by the end of the 10th century CE,\nmaterials related to the circle of the Brethren of Purity\nwere probably known there. Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), a theologian of\nZahirite proclivity, polemized against Greek and Arab philosophers\nwhose text he must have read in a direct or indirect way. But\nphilosophy in its proper sense is first found in Shelomo Ibn Gabirol\nor Avicebron (1021\u20131058). The great figure of Medieval Judaism\nwho was born in Malaga, but was active in Saragossa for most of his\nlife, before moving to Granada and then to Valencia, where he died,\nwas also a talented philosopher. He preceded, by over two generations,\nthe first Muslim philosophers of Al-Andalus: Abu Muhammad Ibn\nal-S\u012bd al-Batalyusi (d. 1127), Abu s-Salt Umayya ibn \u02bdAbd\nal-\u02bdAziz ibn Abi s-Salt ad-Dani (d. 1134) and Ibn B\u00e2jja, or\nAvempace (d. 1139), the latter being active also in that northern town\nof Saragossa.\n\nThe reasons for the later development of philosophy in Muslim\nAl-Andalus, therefore, cannot be explained only by the fact that the\ncountry was situated far away from that nurturing source. The cause is\nlikely that philosophy was never central to the Islamic intellectual\nconstellation and that it flourished in peripheral areas, geographical\nas well as doctrinal. The greatest evidence is Ibn Sina (d. 1037) who\nlived in the Iranian provinces, never visited Baghdad and enjoyed the\npatronage of princes friendly to the Shi\u02bba. Al-Andalus was\nperipheral in geographical, but not in doctrinal, terms. The country\nfollowed Sunni orthodoxy and the Malekite school of law prevailed\nwhile Ash\u201barite theology was weakly cultivated. When Abu l-Qasim\nSa\u02bdid Ibn Sa\u02bdid (d. 1070) devoted a chapter of his world\nhistory of the sciences and philosophy to Al-Andalus, his information\nabout philosophy was significantly scarce (Sa\u02bdid 1998:\n96\u2013108; 1991: 58\u201378).\n\nFrom 1009 through 1031, Al-Andalus lived the fitna period, that ended\nwith the abolition of the Cordovan caliphate in 1031. Saragossa was in\nthe periphery and its kingdom welcomed poets, scholars and scientists\nmigrating from Cordova and other places. In spite of the circumstances\nretarding its development, philosophy in Al-Andalus blossomed into\nmaturity with Ibn Bajja.\n\nC.E. dates are used in the entry unless an Anno Hegirae date is also\nwritten; in this case they are separate by a slash\u2014A.H. is set\nbefore and C.E. after it.
