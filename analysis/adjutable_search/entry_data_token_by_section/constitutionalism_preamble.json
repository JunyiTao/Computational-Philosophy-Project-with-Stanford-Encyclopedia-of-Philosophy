    "main_text": "\n\nConstitutionalism is the idea, often associated with the political\ntheories of John Locke and the founders of the American republic, that\ngovernment can and should be legally limited in its powers, and that\nits authority or legitimacy depends on its observing these\nlimitations. This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of\ninterest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the\nlegal and philosophical foundations of the state. How can a government\nbe legally limited if law is the creation of government? Does this\nmean that a government can be \u2018self-limiting\u2019? Is this\neven possible? If not, then is there some way of avoiding this\nimplication? If meaningful limitation is indeed to be possible,\nperhaps constitutional constraints must somehow be\n\u2018entrenched\u2019, that is, resistant to change or removal by\nthose whose powers are constrained? Perhaps they must not only be\nentrenched, but enshrined in written rules. If so, how are these rules\nto be interpreted? In terms of their original, public meaning or the\nintentions of their authors, or in terms of the, possibly\never-developing, values and principles they express? How, in the end,\none answers these questions depends crucially on how one conceives the\nnature, identity and authority of constitutions. Must a constitution\nestablish a stable framework for the exercise of public power which is\nin some way fixed by factors like original public meaning or\nauthorial intentions? Or can it be a living entity which\ngrows and develops in tandem with changing political values and\nprinciples? These and other such questions are explored below.\n",
