    "main_text": "Rationality and Realism || Rationality\n6.2 Realism\n\nDeeply convinced of the tenability of scientific realism, Salmon\nargued in favor of its compatibility with empiricism. His argument\nrevolves around what he calls the key question, phrased as\nfollows:\n\n\nDo we have empirical evidence that gives us just about as much reason\nto believe in the existence of such entities as molecules, atoms,\nions, and subatomic particles as we have for our belief in\nmiddle-sized material objects? (Salmon 2005: 32)\n\n\nThe possibility of combining empiricism and realism is made to depend\non an affirmative answer to this question, which Salmon claimed had\nnot been given serious consideration by most philosophers of science,\nincluding van Fraassen, whose constructive empiricism implies a\nnegative answer to the key question, and therefore the incompatibility\nbetween empiricism and realism.\n\nIn order to provide an affirmative answer to the key question, Salmon\nonce again drew inspiration from Reichenbach\u2019s work. In\nExperience and Prediction Reichenbach tackled the issue of\nour knowledge of the external world by means of a fictional example.\nHe imagined a \u201ccubical world\u201d whose inhabitants cannot\npenetrate either the walls or the ceiling, made of a translucent\nsubstance. In Salmon\u2019s words:\n\n\nAs a result of a complicated arrangement of lights and mirrors,\nshadows of the birds outside of the cube are projected onto the\nceiling and the left-hand wall. The inhabitants of the cubical world\ncan see the shadows cast by the external birds, but they cannot see\nthe actual birds, mirrors, or lighting system. For beings in the\ncubical world, the birds are truly unobserved entities. (Salmon 1999:\n303)\n\n\nAfter careful observations, a scientist in the cubical world notices\nthere are correlations between the shadows on the ceiling and those on\nthe wall. After having repeatedly observed such correlations, the\nscientist infers the probabilistic hypothesis that there must exist\nsomething responsible for the shadows seen on the walls and ceiling.\nThe reasoning leading to that conclusion is nothing other than an\ninference to a common cause. Although the principle of the\ncommon cause (see\n \u00a7 5.4.1)\n was introduced by Reichenbach in The Direction of Time,\npublished posthumously in 1956, and does not appear at all in\nExperience and Prediction (1938), Salmon conjectured that the\nidea was already there, as testified by Reichenbach\u2019s tenet that\nany physicist who happens to repeatedly observe some coincidences\n\u201cwill not believe in a matter of chance but will look for a\ncausal connection\u201d (Reichenbach 1938: 121).\n\nFor Salmon, the fundamental role played by the principle of the common\ncause in connection with realism was testified by a great many\nexamples in the history of science, his favorite being Perrin\u2019s\nascertainment of Avogadro\u2019s number around 1912. As recounted by\nMary Jo Nye in Molecular Reality (1972), after Perrin showed\nthat Avogadro\u2019s number could be determined by means of thirteen\ndifferent methods, all producing results in close agreement, the\ncommunity of physicists was convinced of the reality of atoms and\nmolecules. According to Salmon, Perrin\u2019s conclusion was reached\nby means of an inductive reasoning which \u201ccan appropriately be\nschematized as a type of common cause argument\u201d (Salmon 1985b\n[2005: 17]). From this and other examples Salmon concluded that a\npowerful method for inferring hypotheses from empirical evidence of\nregularities, the principle of the common cause provides a tool for\ninferring unobservables from observables.\n\nThis, however, is only part of the story. Salmon believed that the\nanswer to the key question \u201clies in connecting the common cause\nprinciple and Bayes\u2019s theorem\u201d (Salmon 1994a [2005: 25]).\nAlthough crediting him for having grasped the same idea, Salmon found\nReichenbach\u2019s treatment incomplete, because it contains only\nsketchy remarks in that regard. He therefore set himself the task of\nworking out a detailed argument, spelled out in \u201cOrnithology in\na Cubical World\u201d (1999) and \u201cAn Empiricist Argument for\nRealism\u201d published as Chapter 3 of Reality and\nRationality. In Salmon\u2019s own words, his purpose was:\n\n\nto show how the considerations that convinced serious physical\nscientists of the reality of atoms and molecules in the early years of\nthe twentieth century provide a philosophically sound argument for\nrealism that does not exceed the bounds of empiricism. (2005: x)\n\n\nIn a nutshell, the fruitfulness of combining Bayes\u2019 rule with\nthe principle of the common cause amounts to the fact that those\nhypotheses which embody information on common causes are apt to be\nassigned higher prior probabilities than hypotheses which involve mere\ncoincidences.\n\nSalmon reached this conclusion by scrutinizing the way scientists\nachieved a number of important findings, such as the existence of\natoms and molecules. His in-depth analysis of case studies belonging\nto the history of science, carried out with respect to both\nmicroscopic objects and the submicroscopic domain, confers on\nSalmon\u2019s argument for realism a peculiar significance and\noriginality.\n\nFurther reading: The volume Reality and Rationality\n(Salmon 2005) contains many articles on Salmon\u2019s views on\nrationality and realism.\n",
