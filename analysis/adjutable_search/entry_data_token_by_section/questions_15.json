    "main_text": "Embedded (or indirect) questions || Knowledge-wh and the imperative-epistemic theory of wh-questions\n4.1 Knowledge-wh and the imperative-epistemic theory of wh-questions\n\nKnowledge-wh figures explicitly in the imperative-epistemic theory\nof wh-questions developed by \u00c5qvist (1965). The\nimperative-epistemic account is further developed by Hintikka (1975,\n1976) and has been influential among philosophers of science\ninterested in models of inquiry and discovery, such as Kleiner\n(1993).\n\nAccording to the imperative-epistemic account, to ask a question is to\nissue an imperative requiring the addressee to bring it about that the\nspeaker knows the answer to the question. Knowledge-wh comes into it\nbecause to know the answer is to be in a state that can be described\nusing a knowledge-wh sentence. For example, according to the\nimperative-epistemic account, question (41) is to be understood as\nimperative (42):\n\n (41) Is the cat on the\nmat? \n (42) Bring it about\nthat I know whether the cat is on the mat! \n\n\nand question (43) is to be understood as imperative (44):\n\n (43) When does the\nmeeting begin? \n (44) Bring it about\nthat I know when the meeting begins! \n\n",
