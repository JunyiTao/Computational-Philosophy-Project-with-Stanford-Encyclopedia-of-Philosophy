    "main_text": "What is Knowledge? || Knowing Individuals\n2.1 Knowing Individuals\n\nEven if you know many facts about Napoleon, it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat you know Napoleon. You couldn\u2019t ever have known Napoleon,\nsince he died long before you were born. But, despite not having ever\nknown Napoleon, you could still know a great many facts about\nNapoleon\u2014perhaps you know even more facts about Napoleon than\ndid those who knew him most intimately. This shows that knowing a\nperson is not the same as knowing a great many facts about the person:\nthe latter is not sufficient for the former. And perhaps the former is\nnot even sufficient for the latter, since I might know my next door\nneighbor, and yet not realize that he is an undercover agent, and that\nalmost everything he tells me about himself is false.\n\nKnowing a person is a matter of being acquainted with that person, and\nacquaintance involves some kind of perceptual relation to the person.\nWhat kind of perceptual relation? Clearly, not just any perceptual\nrelation will do: I see and hear thousands of people while walking\naround a bustling city, but it doesn\u2019t follow that I am\nacquainted with any of them. Must acquaintance involve an ability to\ndistinguish that individual from others? It depends upon what such an\nability amounts to. I am acquainted with my next door neighbor, even\nthough, in some sense, I cannot distinguish him from his identical\ntwin: if they were together I couldn\u2019t tell who was who.\n\nJust as we can be acquainted with a person, so too can we be\nacquainted with a city, a species of bird, a planet, 1960s jazz music,\nWatson and Crick\u2019s research, transphobia, and so on. If\nit\u2019s not clear precisely what acquaintance demands in the case\nof people, it\u2019s even less clear what it demands across all of\nthese various cases. If there is a genus of cognitive success\nexpressed by the verb \u201cto know\u201d with a direct object, or\nby the French \u201cconnaitre\u201d, we have not yet understood that\ngenus.\n",
