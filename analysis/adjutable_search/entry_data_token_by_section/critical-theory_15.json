    "main_text": "Critical Concepts || Reification\n3.2 Reification\n\nReification is a concept with close ties to alienation. If alienation\nis viewed as diagnosing a distorted relation to the world, reification\ncan be understood as one way of articulating the form that distortion\ncan take. In the broadest sense, reification is a term used to\ncritique cases in which some entity that should not be viewed as an\nobject \u2013 oneself, other people, or some segment of the social or\nnatural world \u2013 is treated as a thing-like object. It is\ninstrumentalized, objectified, or quantified in a way that is\ninappropriate according to some critical standard. One challenge for\ncritical theorists is articulating the standard or perspective \u2013\na non-reified relation or perspective \u2013 according to which the\nreified stance is not appropriate.\n\nGeorg Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s classic 1923 essay on reification heavily\ninfluenced the Frankfurt School. Luk\u00e1cs combined Marx\u2019s\nanalysis of the \u201cfetishism of commodities\u201d \u2013 which\ncauses social relations between human beings to appear as quantifiable\nand thing-like \u2013 with Weber\u2019s analysis of bureaucracy\n\u2013 which extends this instrumentalizing attitude to all social\ndomains. Reification becomes \u201cthe necessary, immediate reality\nof every person living in capitalist society\u201d (1923 [1971,\n197]), which can refer to an instrumentalizing attitude taken toward\nobjects (whose qualitative feature are reduced to quantitative terms),\nother people, and features of one\u2019s own personality when viewed\nsolely from the perspective of their marketability.\n\nDifferent critical theorists have appealed to the concept of\nreification to capture similar but not identical phenomena, with\ndiffering definitions corresponding to differences in the larger\ntheoretical framework in which they deploy the concept. For Horkheimer\nand Adorno, the concept captures the dominance of instrumental reason\nand the totally administered world that results (1947). Habermas\nreinterpreted the concept to describe the ways in which systems such\nas the economy and the bureaucratic state, which function properly as\nspheres in which instrumental rationality dominates, extend too far\ninto spheres of everyday life that he refers to as the lifeword\n(1981). This \u201ccolonization\u201d of the lifeworld by the system\nresults in the communicative structures of the lifeworld becoming\nreified. Honneth, by contrast, takes up the concept of reification in\nrelation to his theory of recognition, arguing that reification\ninvolves a kind of forgetting of a primary relation of mutual\nrecognition that he calls \u201cempathetic engagement\u201d (2005).\nWithin Rosa\u2019s theory of resonance, in which he attempts to\ncapture one side of the history of modernity as a \u201ccatastrophe\nof resonance,\u201d reification can be viewed as a\n\u201cforgetfulness of resonance\u201d (2016 [2019, 325]). The\nrevival of this concept has been extended in other ways by using\nreification as a guiding concept for analyzing the relation between\neconomics and subject formation within a \u201cpolitical economy of\nthe senses\u201d (Chari 2015) or pairing reification with a suitably\nmodified notion of reconciliation to assess experiences of exclusion\nand integration within modern social orders (Hedrick 2019).\n",
