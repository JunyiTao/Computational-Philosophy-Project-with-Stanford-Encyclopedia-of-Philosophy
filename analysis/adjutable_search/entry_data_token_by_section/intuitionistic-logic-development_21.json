    "main_text": "The Proof Interpretation Made Explicit || Kolmogorov 1932 and Heyting 1934\n5.4 Heyting 1956\n\nIn his influential book Intuitionism. An introduction from\n1956, Heyting explains the logical connectives as follows\n(97\u201398, 102):\n\n\u201cA mathematical proposition \\(p\\) always\ndemands a mathematical construction with certain given properties; it\ncan be asserted as soon as such a construction has been carried\nout\u201d.\n\u201c\\(p \\wedge q\\) can be asserted if and only if both \\(p\\)\nand \\(q\\) can be asserted\u201d.\n\u201c\\(p \\vee q\\) can be asserted if and only if at least one of\nthe propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) can be\nasserted\u201d.\n\u201c\\(\\neg p\\) can be asserted if and only if we possess a\nconstruction which from the supposition that a construction \\(p\\)\nwere carried out, leads to a\ncontradiction\u201d.\n\u201cThe implication \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) can be asserted, if and\nonly if we possess a construction \\(r\\), which, joined\nto any construction proving \\(p\\) (supposing that the\nlatter be effected), would automatically effect a construction proving\n\\(q\\)\u201d.\n\u201c\\(\\vdash(\\forall x)p(x)\\) means that \\(p(x)\\) is true for\nevery \\(x\\) in \\(Q\\) [over which \\(x\\)\nranges]; in other words, we possess a general method\nof construction which, if any element \\(a\\) of \\(Q\\)\nis chosen, yields by specialization the construction\n\\(p(a)\\)\u201d.\n\u201c\\((\\exists x)p(x)\\) will be true if and only if an element\n\\(a\\) of \\(Q\\) for which \\(p(a)\\) is\ntrue has actually been constructed\u201d.\n\n\nNote that these explanations are not in terms of proof\nconditions, but of assertion conditions. This may make a\ndifference in particular for the explanation of implication, where,\ninstead of only the information under what condition something counts\nas a proof of \\(p\\), we now can also take into\nconsideration that, by hypothesis, a concrete construction for \\(p\\)\nhas been effected. As we saw in\n section 3.1.2,\n the possibility to do so is crucial for Brouwer\u2019s proof of the\nBar Theorem.\n\nIn the same pages, Heyting also gave the following justification of\nEx Falso:\n\n\nAxiom X [\\(\\neg p \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow q)\\)] may not seem\nintuitively clear. As a matter of fact, it adds to the precision of\nthe definition of implication. You remember that \\(p \\rightarrow q\\)\ncan be asserted if and only if we possess a construction which, joined\nto the construction \\(p\\), would prove \\(q\\).\nNow suppose that \\(\\vdash \\neg p\\), that is, we have\ndeduced a contradiction from the supposition that \\(p\\)\nwere carried out. Then, in a sense, this can be considered as a\nconstruction, which, joined to a proof of \\(p\\) (which\ncannot exist) leads to a proof of \\(q\\). (Heyting 1956:\n102)\n\n\nOne easily recognizes Heyting\u2019s effort to explain Ex\nFalso as much as possible along the same lines as other\nimplications, namely, by providing a concrete construction that leads\nfrom the antecedent to the consequent. In its attempt to provide,\n\u201cin a sense\u201d, a construction, the explanation is clearly\nnot of the same kind as Kolmogorov\u2019s stipulation from 1932. But\nit does not fit into Heyting\u2019s original interpretation of logic\nin terms of intentions directed at constructions and the fulfillment\nof such intentions either. For to fulfill an intention directed toward\na particular construction we will have to exhibit that construction;\nwe will have to exhibit a construction that transforms any proof of\n\\(p\\) into one of \\(q\\). But how can a\nconstruction that from the assumption \\(p\\) arrives at\na contradiction, and therefore generally speaking not at \\(q\\),\nlead to \\(q\\)? It will not do to say\nthat such a construction exists \u201cin a sense\u201d. A\nconstruction that is a construction \u201cin a sense\u201d, which\nHeyting helps himself to here, is no construction.\n\nEven within the intuitionistic movement, not everyone agreed with\nHeyting\u2019s explanation of logic. This is discussed in a supplementary\ndocument:\n\nObjections to the Proof Interpretation\n\n",
