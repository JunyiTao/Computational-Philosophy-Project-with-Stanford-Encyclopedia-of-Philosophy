    "main_text": "Thomas Aquinas and Formal Sameness\n2. Thomas Aquinas and Formal Sameness\n\nThe most influential theory of thought in the thirteenth century goes\nback to Aristotle and has its foremost medieval defender in Thomas\nAquinas. It rests on viewing mental representations or intelligible\nspecies, as Aquinas calls them, as sameness of form. The explanation\nfor why thoughts are about something, exhibit intentionality, or\nrepresent is that the form of the object thought about is in the mind\nof the thinker. According to a popular metaphor, thinking something,\non this view, is being the object thought about in the sense that the\nintellect becomes the object or takes on its form.\n\nFollowing Aristotle in De anima III.4, Aquinas argues, that\nthe mind or the intellective part of the soul has no nature or rather\nit is nothing before it thinks of something. The active intellect\nabstracts the intelligible species from the sensitive species in the\ninternal senses and places it in the potential intellect. Aquinas is\nhere very close to the view we saw Avicenna defend above. The species\nactualizes the potential intellect as a form actualizes a potency. The\nintelligible species in the potential intellect constitutes the\nthought. The intellect is immaterial, according to Aquinas, and since\nhe also famously thinks that matter is the principle of individuation,\nthe intelligible species in the potential intellect is not individual,\nbut universal. This is why Aquinas holds that a thought is always\nuniversal. \n\nThere are many problems associated with this view of mental\nrepresentation. A famous problem is: why are the daffodils outside my\nsoul not about my thought of the daffodils? The forms inside and\noutside my mind are the same, suggesting that mental representation is\nsymmetrical. Aquinas has a famous answer to this problem, which is\nthat the daffodils in the garden are not about my thought because of\nthe mode of the form\u2019s presence in them. The forms in the\ndaffodils are really or naturally present whereas in my mind the\nuniversal form is spiritually or intentionally present.\n\nThe distinction between forms being really/naturally or\nspiritually/intentionally present is central to Aquinas\u2019s theory\nof cognition. A form may be present somewhere without literally making\nwhatever substance it informs into something else. Colors in the air,\nfor example, do not make the air really colored: we see colors in the\nobjects around us but not in the intervening air, although they must\nbe there spiritually if sensation is to be a causal process. This\nmeans, of course, that the air must somehow contain the color, which\nentails that intentionality is not a mark of the mental for Aquinas.\nThe air is not in itself a mind (for discussion, see Pasnau 1997,\nChap. 2, and for a completely different take see Brower and\nBrower-Toland 2008).\n",
