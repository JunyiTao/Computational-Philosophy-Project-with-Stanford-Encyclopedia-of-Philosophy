    "main_text": "Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus || Response to Skepticism\n3.5 Response to Skepticism\n\nWe can compare his conclusion with Pyrrho\u2019s skepticism and\nDescartes\u2019s methodical doubt. First of all, like Pyrrho, Camus\nhas solved his pressing existential issue, namely, avoiding despair,\nby a kind of resolution entailed in accepting our mortality and\nultimate ignorance. But there are two critical differences with\nPyrrho: for Camus we never can abandon the desire to know, and\nrealizing this leads to a quickening of our life-impulses. This last\npoint was already contained in Nuptials, but here is expanded\nto link consciousness with happiness. For Camus, happiness includes\nliving intensely and sensuously in the present coupled with\nSisyphus\u2019s tragic, lucid, and defiant consciousness, his sense\nof limits, his bitterness, his determination to keep on, and his\nrefusal of any form of consolation.\n\nObviously, Camus\u2019s sense of happiness is not a conventional one\nbut Sagi argues it may place him closer to Aristotle than to any other\nthinker insofar as he is championing the full realization of human\ncapacities (Sagi 2002, 79\u201380) Camus is also similar in this to\nNietzsche, who called upon his readers to \u201csay yes to\nlife,\u201d and live as completely as possible at every moment.\nNietzsche\u2019s point was that to be wholly alive means being as\naware of the negative as of the positive, feeling pain, not shunning\nany experience, and embracing life \u201ceven in its strangest and\nhardest problems\u201d (Nietzsche 1888/1954, 562). But how is it\npossible that, by the end of The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus has\nmoved from skepticism (about finding the truth) and nihilism (about\nwhether life has meaning) to advocating an approach to life that is\nclearly judged to be better than others? How does he justify embracing\na normative stance, affirming specific values? This contradiction\nreveals a certain sleight of hand, as the philosopher gives way to the\nartist. It is as an artist that Camus now makes his case for\nacceptance of tragedy, the consciousness of absurdity, and a life of\nsensuous vitality. He advocates this with the image of Sisyphus\nstraining, fully alive, and happy.\n",
