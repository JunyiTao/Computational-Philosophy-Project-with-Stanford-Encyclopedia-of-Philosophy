    "main_text": "\n\n\nCategory mistakes are sentences such as \u2018The number two is\nblue\u2019, \u2018The theory of relativity is eating\nbreakfast\u2019, or \u2018Green ideas sleep furiously\u2019. Such\nsentences are striking in that they are highly odd or infelicitous,\nand moreover infelicitous in a distinctive sort of way. For example,\nthey seem to be infelicitous in a different way to merely trivially\nfalse sentences such as \u2018\\(2 + 2 = 5\\)\u2019 or obviously\nungrammatical strings such as \u2018The ran this\u2019.\n\n\nThe majority of contemporary discussions of the topic are devoted to\nexplaining what makes category mistakes infelicitous, and a wide\nvariety of accounts have been proposed including syntactic, semantic,\nand pragmatic explanations. Indeed, this is part of what makes\ncategory mistakes a particularly important topic: a theory of what\nmakes category mistakes unacceptable can potentially shape our\ntheories of syntax, semantics, or pragmatics and the boundaries\nbetween them. As Camp (2016, 611\u2013612) explains: \u201cCategory\nmistakes \u2026 are theoretically interesting precisely because they\nare marginal: as by-products of our linguistic and conceptual systems\nlacking any obvious function, they reveal the limits of, and\ninteractions among, those systems. Do syntactic or semantic\nrestrictions block \u2018is green\u2019 from taking\n\u2018Two\u2019 as a subject? Does the compositional machinery\nproceed smoothly, but fail to generate a coherent proposition or\ndelimit a coherent possibility? Or is the proposition it produces\nsimply one that our paltry minds cannot grasp, or that fails to arouse\nour interest? One\u2019s answers to these questions depend on, and\nconstrain, one\u2019s conceptions of syntax, semantics, and\npragmatics, of language and thought, and of the relations among them\nand between them and the world.\u201d\n\n\nMoreover, the question of how to account for the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes has implications for a variety of other\nphilosophical questions. For example, in metaphysics, it is often\nargued that a statue must be distinct from the lump of clay from which\nit is made because \u2018The statue is Romanesque\u2019 is true,\nwhile \u2018The lump of clay is Romanesque\u2019 is\nnot\u2014indeed, the latter ascription arguably constitutes a\ncategory mistake. Correspondingly, an assessment of this argument\ndepends on one\u2019s account of category mistakes (see \u00a74\nbelow).\n\n\nAfter a brief discussion of how to characterize category mistakes\n(\u00a71) and of the history of the debate (\u00a72), the majority of\nthis entry focuses on the question of how to account for the\ninfelicity of category mistakes (\u00a73). We conclude with some of\nthe implications of the debate on category mistakes for other issues\nin both philosophy of language and metaphysics (\u00a74).\n",
