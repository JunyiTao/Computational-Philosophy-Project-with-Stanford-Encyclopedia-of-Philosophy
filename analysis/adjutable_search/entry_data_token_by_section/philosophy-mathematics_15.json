    "main_text": "Structuralism and Nominalism || Mathematics Without Abstract Entities\n4.3 Mathematics Without Abstract Entities\n\nGoodman and Quine tried early on to bite the bullet: they embarked on\na project to reformulate theories from natural science without making\nuse of abstract entities (Goodman & Quine 1947). The nominalistic\nreconstruction of scientific theories proved to be a difficult task.\nQuine, for one, abandoned it after this initial attempt. In the past\ndecades many theories have been proposed that purport to give a\nnominalistic reconstruction of mathematics. (Burgess & Rosen 1997)\ncontains a good critical discussion of such views.\n\nIn a nominalist reconstruction of mathematics, concrete entities will\nhave to play the role that abstract entities play in platonistic\naccounts of mathematics, and concrete relations (such as the\npart-whole relation) have to be used to simulate mathematical\nrelations between mathematical objects. But here problems arise.\nFirst, already Hilbert observed that, given the discretization of\nnature in quantum mechanics, the natural sciences may in the end claim\nthat there are only finitely many concrete entities (Hilbert 1925).\nYet it seems that we would need infinitely many of them to play the\nrole of the natural numbers \u2014 never mind the real numbers. Where\ndoes the nominalist find the required collection of concrete entities?\nSecondly, even if the existence of infinitely many concrete objects is\nassumed, it is not clear that even elementary mathematical theories\nsuch as Primitive Recursive Arithmetic can be \u201csimulated\u201d\nby means of nominalistic relations (Niebergall 2000).\n\nField made an earnest attempt to carry out a nominalistic\nreconstruction of Newtonian mechanics (Field 1980). The basic idea is\nthis. Field wanted to use concrete surrogates of the real numbers and\nfunctions on them. He adopted a realist stance toward the spatial\ncontinuum, and took regions of space to be as physically real as\nchairs and tables. And he took regions of space to be concrete (after\nall, they are spatially located). If we also count the very\ndisconnected ones, then there are as many regions of Newtonian space\nas there are subsets of the real numbers. And then there are enough\nconcrete entities to play the role of the natural numbers, the real\nnumbers, and functions on the real numbers. And the theory of the real\nnumbers and functions on them is all that is needed to formulate\nNewtonian mechanics. Of course it would be even more interesting to\nhave a nominalistic reconstruction of a truly contemporary scientific\ntheory such as Quantum Mechanics. But given that the project can be\ncarried out for Newtonian mechanics, some degree of initial optimism\nseems justified.\n\nThis project clearly has its limitations. It may be possible\nnominalistically to interpret theories of function spaces on the real\nnumbers, say. But it seems far-fetched to think that along Fieldian\nlines a nominalistic interpretation of set theory can be found.\nNevertheless, if it is successful within its confines, then\nField\u2019s program has really achieved something. For it would mean\nthat, to some extent at least, mathematical entities appear to be\ndispensable after all. He would thereby have taken an important step\ntowards undermining the indispensability argument for Quinean modest\nplatonism in mathematics, for, to some extent, mathematical entities\nappear to be dispensable after all.\n\nField\u2019s strategy only has a chance of working if Hilbert\u2019s\nfear that in a very fundamental sense our best scientific theories may\nentail that there are only finitely many concrete entities, is\nill-founded. If one sympathizes with Hilbert\u2019s concern but does\nnot believe in the existence of abstract entities, then one might bite\nthe bullet and claim that there are only finitely many\nmathematical entities, thus contradicting the basic\nprinciples of elementary arithmetic. This leads to a position that has\nbeen called ultra-finitism (Essenin-Volpin 1961).\n\nOn most accounts, ultra-finitism leads, like intuitionism, to\nrevisionism in mathematics. For it would seem that one would then have\nto say that there is a largest natural number, for instance. From the\noutside, a theory postulating only a finite mathematical universe\nappears proof-theoretically weak, and therefore very likely to be\nconsistent. But Woodin has developed an argument that purports to show\nthat from the ultra-finitist perspective, there are no grounds for\nasserting that the ultra-finitist theory is likely to be consistent\n(Woodin 2011).\n\nRegardless of this argument (the details of which are not discussed\nhere), many already find the assertion that there is a largest number\nhard to swallow. But Lavine has articulated a sophisticated form of\nset-theoretical ultra-finitism which is mathematically non-revisionist\n(Lavine 1994). He has developed a detailed account of how the\nprinciples of ZFC can be taken to be principles that describe\ndeterminately finite sets, if these are taken to include indefinitely\nlarge ones.\n",
