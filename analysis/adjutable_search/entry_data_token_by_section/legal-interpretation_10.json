Conclusion\nSeveral competing approaches to legal interpretation, such as intentionalism and textualism, are familiar to lawyers and legal theorists. Despite a large literature, there is a great deal of unclarity about what these approaches amount to \u2013 that is, about precisely which methods they recommend. Understanding can be greatly improved by attention to how language and meaning work and by explication of important distinctions, such as those between different types of intentions.\nBut there is a more fundamental question that has to be addressed in order to make progress on the question of which method of legal interpretation is correct. The question is what legal interpretation, by its nature, seeks. Although this question is not often explicitly addressed, several different candidates can be found in the literature. We assessed these candidates and saw that there is a powerful case that legal interpretation seeks provisions\u2019 contribution to the law.\nGiven this conclusion, which method of interpretation is correct will depend on how the content of the law is determined. On Hart\u2019s theory of law and other influential accounts, many familiar arguments deployed to defend methods of interpretation are not even of the appropriate sort.\nAlthough attention to the theory of law is critical to progress in the field of legal interpretation, there is space between the theory of legal interpretation and the theory of law. The theory of legal interpretation may take into account values other than accurately identifying the content of the law. And there is also the possibility that legal interpreters will more accurately identify the content of the law by following relatively simple rules of thumb than by trying to identify the content of the law directly.\n",
