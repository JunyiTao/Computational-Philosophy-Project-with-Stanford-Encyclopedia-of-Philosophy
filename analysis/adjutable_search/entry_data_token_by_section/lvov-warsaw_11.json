It is based on a conception of\nlanguage and meaning. The concept of meaning is taken as a primitive.\nNow, the meaning of expressions in a language L\ninduces the rules for accepting its sentences. Ajdukiewicz lists three\nkinds of meaning-rules (or sense-rules): (a) axiomatic (they demand\nthe unconditional acceptance of sentences, for example,\n\u201cA is A\u201d; (b) deductive (they demand the\nacceptance of a sentence relatively to the prior acceptance of other\nsentences, for example, \u00acA follows from A \u2192\nB and \u00acB), (c) empirical (they demand the\nacceptance of a sentence in a definite empirical situation, for\nexample \u201cit is raining\u201d when it rains).\n\nThe special significance of meaning-rules and their relation to the\nmeanings of expressions appears when special languages are taken into\naccount, namely closed and connected. A language L is\nopen if it can be extended to a new language L\u2032\nwithout changes in the meanings of other expressions; otherwise\nL is closed. A language is disconnected if there is a\nnon-empty subset X of L such that no\nelement of X is linked by the meaning-rules to other\nelements of L; otherwise, L is\nconnected. It follows from the above definitions that if\nL is closed and connected, it cannot be enriched\nwithout changing the meanings of the original expressions.\n\nAccording to Ajdukiewicz, natural languages are open and disconnected.\nBy contrast, scientific languages are closed and disconnected. Let\nL be closed and connected. The set of meanings of\nL is its conceptual apparatus. If A\nand A\u2032 are two conceptual apparatuses, they are\neither identical or mutually non-translatable. Since the acceptance\nand rejection of sentences is always related to a language\nL, empirical data do no force us to accept or reject\nany sentences, because there always remains the possibility of\nchanging a given conceptual apparatus. This is a considerable\nradicalization of the conventionalism of Poincar\u00e9. The\ndifference is the following. For Poincar\u00e9, since theoretical\nprinciples are conventions, we are free to modify them, but\nexperiential reports are perfectly stable. Ajdukiewicz extended\nconventionalism to all sentences, because any sentence, no matter\nwhether experiential or theoretical, depends on a conceptual\napparatus. It is why Ajdukiewicz called this conventionalism\nradical.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930s Ajdukiewicz changed his view. He came to\nthe conclusion that closed and connected languages are fictions. He\nwas influenced by the semantic ideas of Tarski. Tarski also argued\nthat, contrary to Ajdukiewicz\u2019s hopes, the invariance of\nmeaning-rules over permutations of expressions influences their\nmeaning-relations. Gradually, Ajdukiewicz developed the program of\nsemantic epistemology, mainly directed toward the defence of realism\nagainst various forms of idealism. In particular, he criticized\nRickert\u2019s transcendental idealism and Berkeley\u2019s\nsubjectivism. For Rickert, reality is only a correlate of the\nTranscendental Subject. Now the Transcendental Subject can be\nidentified with the set T of true propositions\nobtainable on the basis of axiomatic and deductive rules. However, due\nto incompleteness phenomena, T cannot be generated in\nthis way. For Ajdukiewicz, that was a justification that\ntranscendental idealism fails. Ajdukiewicz compared the language used\nby Berkeley to the language of syntax, because the former reduces\nrelations of the mind to its objects to relations between thoughts. On\nthe other hand, the ordinary way of speaking about objects employs\nsemantic relations. Berkeley\u2019s claim esse =\npercipi is similar to an attempt to define semantics in a\npurely syntactic language. However, due to Tarski\u2019s results\nabout the relation between syntax and semantics, this is impossible.\nFinally, Ajdukiewicz argued that any idealistic language is\nunderstandable only if it is associated with a realistic language.\nHence, any attempt to consider idealistic language as self-sufficient\ncannot be successful.\n",
