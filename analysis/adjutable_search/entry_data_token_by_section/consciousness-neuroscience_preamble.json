    "main_text": "\n\nConscious experience in humans depends on brain activity, so\nneuroscience will contribute to explaining consciousness. What would\nit be for neuroscience to explain consciousness? How much progress has\nneuroscience made in doing so? What challenges does it face? How can\nit meet those challenges? What is the philosophical significance of\nits findings? This entry addresses these and related questions.\n\nTo bridge the gulf between brain and consciousness, we need neural\ndata, computational and psychological models, and philosophical\nanalysis to identify principles to connect brain activity to conscious\nexperience in an illuminating way. This entry will focus on\nidentifying such principles without shying away from the neural\ndetails. The notion of neuroscientific explanation here conceives\nof it as providing informative answers to concrete questions that can\nbe addressed by neuroscientific approaches. Accordingly, the theories\nand data to be considered will be organized around constructing\nanswers to two questions (see\n section 1.4\n for more precise formulations):\n\nGeneric Consciousness: How might neural properties explain when a\nstate is conscious rather than not?\nSpecific Consciousness: How might neural properties explain what\nthe content of a conscious state is?\n\n\nA challenge for an objective science of consciousness is to dissect an\nessentially subjective phenomenon. As investigators cannot experience\nanother subject\u2019s conscious states, they rely on the\nsubject\u2019s observable behavior to track consciousness. Priority\nis given to a subject\u2019s introspective reports as these express\nthe subject\u2019s take on her experience. Introspection thus\nprovides a fundamental way, perhaps the fundamental way, to\ntrack consciousness. That said, consciousness pervasively influences\nhuman behavior, so other forms of behavior beyond introspective\nreports provide a window on consciousness. How to leverage disparate\nbehavioral evidence is a central issue. \n\nThe term \u201cneuroscience\u201d covers those scientific fields\nwhose explanations advert to the properties of neurons, populations of\nneurons, or larger parts of the nervous\n system.[1]\n This includes, but is not limited to, psychologists\u2019 use of\nvarious neuroimaging methods to monitor the activity of tens of\nmillions of neurons, computational theorists\u2019 modelling of\nbiological and artificial neural networks, neuroscientists\u2019 use\nof electrodes inserted into brain tissue to record neural activity\nfrom individual or populations of neurons, and clinicians\u2019 study\nof patients with altered conscious experiences in light of damage to\nbrain areas.\n\nGiven the breadth of neuroscience so conceived, an overview of\nsufficient depth must restrict breadth. On the neuroscience side, this\nreview focuses on the central nervous system and the electrical\nproperties of neurons, particularly in the cerebral cortex. On the\nside of consciousness, it focuses on perceptual consciousness, with\nemphasis on vision. This is not because visual consciousness is more\nimportant than other forms of consciousness. Rather, the level of\ndetail in empirical work on vision often speaks more comprehensively\nto the issues that we shall confront.\n\nThat said, there are many forms of consciousness that we will not\ndiscuss. Some are covered in other entries\nsuch as split brain phenomena (see the entry on\n the unity of consciousness,\n section 4.1.1), animal consciousness (see the entry on\n animal consciousness),\nand neural correlates of the will and agency (see the\nentry on \n agency,\n section 5). In addition, this entry will not discuss the neuroscience\nof consciousness in audition, olfaction or gustation; disturbed\nconsciousness in mental disorders such as schizophrenia; conscious\naspects of pleasure, pain and the emotions; the phenomenology of\nthought; the neural basis of dreams; and modulations of consciousness\nduring sleep and anesthesia among other issues. These are important\ntopics, and the principles and approaches highlighted in this\ndiscussion will apply to many of these domains.\n",
