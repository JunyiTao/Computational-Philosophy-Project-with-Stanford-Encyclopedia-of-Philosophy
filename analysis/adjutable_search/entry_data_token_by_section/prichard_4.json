    "main_text": "The Rights and Wrongs of Kantianism\n5. The Rights and Wrongs of Kantianism\n\nPrichard\u2019s other main target was Kant. As he sees it, Kant\nmaintained that an action is right if and only if it is done from the\nmotive of duty, that is, from a sense of obligation. Now Prichard\nwants to admit that it can be good to act from this motive; maybe this\nis the only morally good motive. Other motives, such as a general\nbenevolence, may make the relevant action good, but cannot make it\nmorally good. But he wants first to insist that we cannot have an\nobligation to act from a particular motive, as we have already seen.\nAnd there are further difficulties peculiar to Kant\u2019s position,\nin which the motive is specified as the conviction that the act\nconcerned is a duty. The first is that the position has the\nconsequence that no act, in Prichard\u2019s official narrow sense, is\na duty at all. One\u2019s duty is to act from the motive of duty,\nnever to do this or that act in the narrow sense. So Prichard is able\nto present Kant as holding that there is nothing that we ought to do,\nand therefore that it is impossible to act from the sense that one\nought to do this. If so, Kant has undermined his own position, since\nhis understanding of the motive of duty shows that there can be no\nsuch thing. Or rather, if there is such a thing as the motive of duty,\nit follows necessarily that it cannot be one\u2019s sole or primary\nduty to act on it.\n\nThis is a lovely chain of criticism, but it seems to me to suffer from\na mistake right at the beginning \u2013 which, if it is a mistake, is\none echoed by Ross (1930, 5), though Ross corrected his mistake later\n(1939, 139). Kant held that an action was only morally good if done\nfrom the motive of duty, but he did not hold, as far as I can see,\nthat an act is only right if done from that motive. The Kantian\nCategorical Imperative \u2018I ought never to act except in such a\nway that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal\nlaw\u2019 need not, and surely should not, be read as saying acts are\nonly right if motivated in a certain way. Kant treats it as an open\nquestion whether an act done \u2018in conformity with duty\u2019 has\nalso been done \u2018from duty\u2019. He would think it possible for\npeople to do what they ought, do the right thing, even if their\nactions do not have the special sort of value that so interests him.\nActions have that sort of value when they are done out of respect for\nthe law rather than merely in accordance with it.\n\nSo it seems to me that Prichard imposes on Kant a view that he neither\nheld nor needed to hold (but see the extended discussion of Kant\n(153\u20139), which ends \u2018Plainly he had not fully thought the\nposition out.\u2019). Prichard would have done better to concentrate\non the difference between Kant\u2019s account of how it comes about\nthat an action is a duty and his own minimal account. Kant\u2019s\nexplanation would start from the fact that the maxim of the action can\nbe willed as a universal law. Prichard would, I think, say that there\nis no possibility of, or need for, any such explanation. This is just\none more instance of the quietism that characterizes intuitionism as\nopposed to constructivism.\n",
