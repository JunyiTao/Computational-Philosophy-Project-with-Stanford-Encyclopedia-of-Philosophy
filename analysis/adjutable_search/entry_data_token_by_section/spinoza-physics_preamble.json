    "main_text": "\n\nSpinoza's thought stands at an uneasy and volatile period in the\ndevelopment of physical theory. His physical science is largely\nCartesian, both in content and rationalistic method. It is harshly\ndismissive of the \u201coccult qualities, intentional species,\nsubstantial forms, and a thousand other trifles\u201d (letter 60, to\nBoxel) of pre-revolutionary scholastic natural philosophy. It is\nlikewise antagonistic to the new Baconian experimentalism, holding\nthat empirical findings can at best present examples of what reason\nitself demonstrates.   Spinoza neither perceives the\nparticular difficulties for Cartesian physical theory that lead\nLeibniz to revive both finalism and substantial forms, nor foresees\nthe Newtonian theory of universal gravitation whose mathematical and\nempirical superiority to the Cartesian vortex theory lead to its\nuniversal acceptance, despite its own revival of occult powers in the\nform of forces operating at a distance.\n\nYet Spinoza is no orthodox Cartesian. He recognizes a variety of\nshortcomings in Descartes' physical views and moreover rejects much of\nthe metaphysical foundation upon which these views rest. In light of\nthese disagreements, Spinoza holds that bodies are not substances, but\nrather modifications of a single substance, and he develops a\ndistinctive and novel view of their individuation. He must also find\nan alternative basis for the basic principles that underlie and\nexplain the motion and interaction of bodies. The resulting physical\nview arguably contains anticipations of the fundamental character of\nmodern physics, and certainly anticipates modern theory of homeostatic\nsystems. Yet in spite of its express mechanistic and deterministic\ncharacter, Spinoza's physical theory appears to exploit an irreducible\nelement of finalism, and to accord an important explanatory role to\nindividual bodily essences.\n\nThis article first briefly discusses and places in context the textual\nsources most relevant to a consideration of Spinoza's physics. It then\npresent in brief summary those of Spinoza's philosophical views that\nbear most directly on his physical theory. Having identified the\ncentral issues for physical theory that emerge, it then clarifies\nthose issues by examining the sources in more detail. Finally, it\nsituates Spinoza's views vis-\u00e0-vis contemporary\nexperimental and mathematical science.\n\nNote on citation form. Citations to Spinoza's\nEthics give the part in roman capitals, then the proposition,\ndefinition, or axiom number, (e.g., p13, or d5)), and then specify\nwhether the cited material is in a scholium (s), corollary (c), or\nlemma (l). Citations to other works are given in the same style,\nexcept that they are prefaced by the abbreviated title of the work, in\nitalics (e.g., \u201cPCP\u2009\u201d for Principles\nof Cartesian Philosophy).\n",
