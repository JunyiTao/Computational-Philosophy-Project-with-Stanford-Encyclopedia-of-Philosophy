    "main_text": "Philosophical Works, Manuscripts and Translations || The Book of Definitions\n5.1 The Book of Definitions\n\nOriginally written in Arabic, this work is extant in two Latin (Liber\nde Definicionibus/Definitionibus) and two Hebrew translations\n(Sefer ha-Gvulim), but only a fragment of the original Arabic\n(Kitab al-Hudud) survived. That this book was widely read by\nChristian scholastics is evidenced by Thomas Aquinas\u2019 and\nAlbertus Magnus\u2019 misattribution of Avicenna\u2019s definition\nof truth to Isaac\u2019s Book of Definitions (see Altmann\n& Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 59). This book is a collection\nof 57 definitions, the bulk of which are paraphrases and quotes (often\nwithout attribution) of various passages of al-Kindi. In some\ninstances, he cites \u201cthe philosopher\u201d who would be\nunderstood to mean Aristotle, but he is actually paraphrasing\nal-Kindi, who oftentimes purports to elucidate what Aristotle had\nwritten on a particular subject. Occasionally, his definitions derive\nfrom other possible sources such as Qusta ibn Luqa (a physician,\nmathematician, scientist and translator, lived 835\u2013912 C.E.),\nAmmonius Hermiae of Alexandria (Fifth Century C.E.) and John\nPhiloponus (490\u2013ca. 570 C.E.). A few ideas expressed in this\nwork are not attested in any other known sources. Yet, because of the\nbook\u2019s close adherence to al-Kindi, Stern hypothesizes that\nthese deviations are often either quotation of definitions of al-Kindi\nwhich have been lost, or are misreadings of al-Kindi. One of the\ncolophons at the end noted that the work is a\n\u201ccollection,\u201d perhaps indicating that the material was not\noriginal, nor intended to be read as such. In another manuscript the\ncolophon asserts that Isaac Israeli had written it, yet this same\ncolophon contains spurious information\u2014that Israeli was from\nSpain and that he had fathered children whom he hoped would study it\n(Altmann & Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 78), hence its claim\nthat the treatise is an entirely original work of Israeli\u2019s must\nnot be regarded as authoritative.\n\nBoth Latin versions were published by J.T. Muckle, \u201cIssac\nIsraeli, Liber de Definicionibus\u201d in Archives\nd\u2019histoire doctrinale et litteraire du moyen age,\n1937\u20138. The longer version was translated by Gerard of Cremona\n(1114\u20131187), and appears in manuscripts (Paris B.N. 14,700;\nParis B.N. 6443; Vatican Lat. 2186) as well as a printed edition\nOmnia opera Ysaac, from Lyons in 1515. M. Alonso speculated\nthat the shorter version (MS Munich Lat. 8001) is a translation by\nDomingo Gundissalinus and predated the longer version (Alonso, 1947,\npp. 295, 325) (See \u201cTraducciones del arcediano Domingo\nGundisalvo\u201d in Al-Andalus, 1947, pp. 295, 325). Altmann\nand Stern challenge this hypothesis, arguing that the shorter version\nis an epitome of the longer version, improving the translation at\npoints (Isaac Israeli, p. 5).\n\nNissim ben Solomon translated one of the Hebrew versions, and it can\nbe found in its entirety in H. Hirschfeld, Festschrift zum 80.\nGeburtstag M. Steinschneiders, pp. 131\u201342. J.L. Teicher was\nof the opinion that the Hebrew version was translated from the Latin\nversion (See \u201cThe Latin-Hebrew school of translators in Spain in\nthe twelfth century,\u201d in Homanaje a Millas-Vallicrosa,\nv.ii, pp. 416\u201322). Julius Guttman and Stern think that his\nprimary source was the Arabic version (Stern and Altmann, Isaac\nIsraeli, p. 6). The second Hebrew translation, whose translator\nis unknown, was published by Altmann in Journal of Semitic\nStudies, 1957, pp. 232\u201342.\n\nThe surviving Arabic fragment is written in Hebrew characters, but\nthere are indications that the original text was written in Arabic\nscript. The Arabic fragment can be found in the Cambridge\nTaylor-Schechter collection, document TS. 8 Ka.62 and has\nbeen published twice\u2014by H. Hirschfeld in \u201cThe Arabic\nportion of the Cairo Genizah at Cambridge,\u201d Jewish Quarterly\nReview xv (1902), pp. 689\u201393 and by Altmann in Journal of\nSemitic Studies, 1957, pp. 232\u201342. This work is accessible\nin English translation with commentary in Altmann and Stern\u2019s\nIsaac Israeli, 9\u201378.\n",
