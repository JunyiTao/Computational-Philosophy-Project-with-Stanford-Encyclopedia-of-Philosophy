    "main_text": "Belief || Religious Belief\n6.8 Religious Belief\n\nFinally, Price wrote influentially on (i) the nature of religious\nbelief, and (ii) its conflict with science and empiricism (see\n \u00a72.2\n above; also 1953b; 1964c; 1969: Series 2, Lecture 10; 1972; among\nothers). In 1953b and in \u201cReligious Belief and Empiricist\nPhilosophy\u201d (1969), he engages especially with two recent\ndevelopments: that religious claims such as \u201cGod exists\u201d\n(i) are neither true nor false, being devoid of descriptive meaning;\nand (ii) should be interpreted as recommendations of\nlifestyles\u2014say, to love thy neighbour\u2014rather than as\nclaims about transcendent entities (1953b: 3).\n\nPrice suggests the following. Religious \u201crecommendations\u201d\nadvise us to adopt a certain worldview, putting it briefly, to live a\nloving life. Some sort of empirical test is available for the\nrecommendation to live a loving life. We can try it or observe such\nattempts and see if it produces approval and what the recommenders\nthink it will. Importantly, though, the recommended worldview and ways\nof life are committed to the assertion of certain propositions,\nwithout which they cannot even be understood (1953b: 7). For instance,\nthe lifestyle recommendations of theistic religions (e.g.,\nChristianity) require propositions about the real existence of a\ntranscendent deity, human immortality, and generally a theistic theory\nof the universe (1953b: 4\u20136), and for non-theistic religions\nsuch as Buddhism, propositions about reincarnation and the\nnon-existence of a substantial Ego (1953b: 6\u20137). Further, Price\nargues strongly that engaging in many of the religious practices\n(e.g., petitionary prayer) without these beliefs is intellectually\ndishonest. The wishful beliefs, say in God, are an essential part of\nthe psychological techniques and practices of the religion (1972:\n38\u201340). However, earlier (1964c: 18\u201319) he makes room for\ndevotional practices which require merely an \u201cas-if\u201d\nattitude towards God (see\n \u00a74.3).\n\nPrice is, thus, a realist about the interpretation of religious\nclaims, in contrast to his contemporary, Braithwaite (1955). Price\n(1969: 476\u2013488) aims to locate experiential evidence that bears\non such claims and empirical tests of the realist religious hypotheses\nfor earthbound creatures like us. If successful, empiricists should at\nleast have no qualms about the meaningfulness of claims, say, about a\ntranscendental god. The religious view is that we are capable of\nencountering God in devotional experience, such as prayer which\ninvolves a \u201creal\u201d rather than \u201cnotional\u201d\napprehension of God (see 1969: 318\u2013319; Newman 1870)\u2014in\nshort, prayer allows us to be acquainted with God rather than to know\nabout God by description\u2014and via \u201csuper-sensory cognitive\npowers, an awareness of the Divine\u201d (1953b: 31, also 11ff),\nthough he claims in (1964c: 22\u201323) that it would be\n\u201cpresumptuous\u201d of the ordinary religious person to think\nthat they\u2019ve achieved this. So to test it empirically we must,\nwithout prior belief in religion, try out devotional practice\nand see what experiences occur. He does not say what the experiential\noutcome will in general be, and he does not explore problems that\nmight be raised about the interpretation of the resulting experiences.\n(Price\u2019s acquaintance with an apparent religious experience is\nrecounted by Hick 2002: 74\u201375.) He (1964c: 20\u201324) does\ndescribe, however, that it involves a personal relationship of faith,\nbelief, and loving confidence in God, which isn\u2019t propositional\nand involves a removal of the illusion that God is absent (1964d: 35).\nFor discussion: Hartshorne 1964: 31. Price seems content to have\nlinked religious claims to such empirical testing: he writes,\n\u201c\u2018Try it and see for yourself\u2019 is one way of\nformulating the empiricist principle\u201d (1935: 331; 1964c: 24;\n1969: 488;\n \u00a72.2\n above). Also, he argues (1953b: 37\u201354) that psychical research\nhas \u201cdiscovered\u201d (1953b: 54) other forms of\n\u201csupernormal cognition\u201d. Although these discoveries do\n\u201cnothing at all to establish [the sense of the Divine]\u201d\n(1953b: 49), they \u201cdiminish or perhaps even \u2026 remove the\nchief obstacle[:] \u2026 the Materialistic conception of human\nnature\u201d (1953b: 53; for favourable discussion see Russell 1954\n[1999: 147\u2013150]; see also\n \u00a77\n below).\n",
