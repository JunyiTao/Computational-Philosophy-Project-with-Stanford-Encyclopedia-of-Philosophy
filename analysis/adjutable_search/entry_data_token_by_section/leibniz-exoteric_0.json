    "main_text": "The Ideal Form of Metaphysics\n1. The Ideal Form of Metaphysics\n\nLeibniz conceived of metaphysics as an a priori demonstrative science.\nIn its ideal form metaphysics would be presented in a manner analogous\nto Euclid\u2019s Elements, where propositions are rigorously\ndemonstrated on the basis of definitions and axioms. The point of\ndeparture for this conception of metaphysics is Leibniz\u2019s theory\nof truth. Leibniz thought that truth consisted in conceptual\ncontainment: a proposition is true just in case the concept of the\npredicate is contained in the concept of the subject. This implies\nthat all metaphysical truths are conceptual truths. Leibniz thought\nthat a concept could be defined by analyzing it into simpler component\nconcepts. A rigorous demonstration, for Leibniz, consists in a\n\u201cchain of definitions\u201d (catena definitionum)\nwhere one moves from premises to a conclusion via the substitution of\ndefinitionally equivalent terms (A II.i.398; L 198). In order for such\ndemonstrations to attain the degree of certainty found in geometry\nthey would need to be set forth in a purely formal system, which\nLeibniz termed his \u201cuniversal characteristic\u201d\n(characteristica universalis). The universal characteristic\nwould allow one to express in a purely formal manner the composition\nof any concept on the basis of a set of primitive concepts. This\nsystem of representation, in conjunction with a logical calculus for\nexpressing identity and inclusion relations among concepts, would\nenable one to set forth a strictly demonstrative metaphysics (see\nRutherford 1996 for a detailed discussion of Leibniz\u2019s\nconception of a demonstrative metaphysics).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s conception of an ideal metaphysics was incredibly\nambitious. He made impressive progress on the project during his\ncareer, though he fell well short of attaining his lofty ideal. Some\nof Leibniz\u2019s very early texts contain stretches of argument that\nare not carefully divided into axioms, definitions, propositions, and\ndemonstrations, but which could be reconstructed to fit that model.\nConsider, for example, Leibniz\u2019s unpublished 1672\u20133\nConfessio Philosophi (The Confession of a Philosopher).\nTowards the beginning of this work, after providing definitions of\n\u201cGod\u201d, \u201cjustice\u201d, \u201clove\u201d, and\n\u201charmony\u201d, he demonstrates that \u201chappiness consists\nin the most harmonious state of mind\u201d (A VI.iii.117; CP\n31). Leibniz then argues (in the voice of The Philosopher):\n\n\nIf all happiness is harmonious (as demonstrated), and all harmony is\nknown by God (by the definition of God), and all experience\nof harmony is a delight (by the definition of delight), it\nfollows that all happiness is pleasing to God. Therefore (by the\ndefinition of love assumed previously) God loves everyone,\nand, accordingly (by the definition of the just) God is\njust. (A VI.iii.117; CP 31)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s demonstration is slightly informal here (as one might\nexpect in a dialogue), but it could easily be reconstructed in\ndeductive form. In 1675\u20136 Leibniz wrote a number of unpublished\npapers and notes on metaphysical topics (most of the papers are\nincluded in Parkinson\u2019s De Summa Rerum: Metaphysical\nPapers, 1675\u20131676).  These texts include definitions of key\nmetaphysical concepts and many informal demonstrations of metaphysical\npropositions. In the late 1670s Leibniz completed several short drafts\nof works that were divided into axioms, definitions, and propositions,\nalthough the subject matter of those works was not strictly\nmetaphysical (see De Obligatione Credendi A\nVI.iv.c.2149\u20132155 and Animadversiones in schedam ex Batavis\nMissam A VI.iv.c.2204\u20132210). In 1679 Leibniz quickly\ncomposed a work that was closer to the ideal of a demonstrative\nscience of metaphysics than anything he had written to date (De\nAffectibus AVI.iv.b.1410\u20131441). It contained a long list of\ndefinitions of key terms along with some demonstrations of\nmetaphysical principles and theses. Leibniz\u2019s project continued\nin the 1680s in a series of extensive definitional studies of key\nconcepts (see, e.g., De Notionibus Omnia Quae Cogitamus\nContinentibus A.VI.iv.a.398\u2013405, Definitiones Notionum\nMetaphysicarum atque Logicarum A.VI.iv.a.624\u2013630, and\nTabula Notionum Praeparanda A.VI.iv.a.630\u2013635). By 1690\nLeibniz had developed a logical calculus for expressing identity and\ninclusion relations among concepts. Around this time, however, Leibniz\nbegan to doubt whether it was possible to discover absolutely\nprimitive concepts. He also did not succeed in developing his purely\nformal system of representation, the universal characteristic. Without\nprimitive concepts or the universal characteristic it was not possible\nfor Leibniz to attain his ideal of a fully demonstrative metaphysics.\nIt is plausible to think that Leibniz could nevertheless have\ncompleted a work that was an approximation of the ideal, written in\nLatin and using non-primitive concepts. Leibniz insisted throughout\nhis later years that he could complete a work along these lines. In\n1710, for example, he explains to correspondent Charles Hugony that in\nhis (Leibniz\u2019s) recently published Essais de\nth\u00e9odic\u00e9e he set forth one part of his views\n\u201cin an informal manner\u201d and that he is \u201cthinking of\n[writing] a Latin work in which I will try to unfold my entire\nsystem\u201d (G 3:680). And in 1715 Leibniz writes to Biber:\n\n\nif God will grant me more free time, I will attempt by means of\nwell-formed demonstrations to impart to a good portion of my views the\ncertainty of Euclid\u2019s Elements. (LBr 64)\n\n\nBut Leibniz never did unfold his entire system, even in this less\nambitious form.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s account of the ideal form of metaphysics provides the\nbasis for one of the ways that he distinguishes between the esoteric\nand the exoteric. In one of his earliest philosophical works, a very\nopinionated preface to an edition of a book by Marius Nizolius,\nLeibniz distinguishes between esoteric and exoteric modes of\nphilosophizing. In this text he claims that the notion of\ndemonstration provides the line of demarcation between the esoteric\nand exoteric modes. In the former \u201call things are\ndemonstrated\u201d while in the latter less rigorous forms of\nargumentation are utilized (e.g., supporting a proposition by means of\nan analogical argument). Works written in the exoteric mode, though\nuseful in various respects, are \u201cnot most rigorous, not most\nexact\u201d (A VI.ii.416). In this and other texts Leibniz equates\nthe esoteric mode of philosophizing with the geometrical model of\ndemonstration, as briefly described above.\n",
