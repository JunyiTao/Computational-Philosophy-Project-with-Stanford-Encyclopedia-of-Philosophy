    "main_text": "Infinite Iteration\n13. Infinite Iteration\n\nOne way to avoid the dubious conclusion of the backward induction\nargument without delving too deeply into conditions of knowledge and\nrationality is to consider infinitely repeated PDs. No human agents\ncan actually play an infinitely repeated game, of course, but the\ninfinite IPD has been considered an appropriate way to model a series\nof interactions in which the participants never have reason to think\nthe current interaction is their last. In this setting a pair of\nstrategies determines an infinite path through of the game tree. If\nthe payoffs of the one-shot game are positive, their total along any\nsuch path is infinite. This makes it somewhat awkward to compare\nstrategies. In many cases, the average payoff per round approaches a\nlimit as the number of rounds increases, and so that limit can\nconveniently serve as the payoff. (See Binmore 1992, page 365 for\nfurther justification.) For example, if we confine ourselves to those\nstrategies that can be implemented by mechanical devices (with finite\nmemories and speeds of computation), then the sequence of payoffs to\neach player will always, after a finite number of rounds, cycle\nrepeatedly through a particular finite sequence of payoffs. The limit\nof the average payoff per round will then be the average payoff in the\ncycle. In recent years, Press and Dyson have shown that for many\npurposes, investigation of the infinite IPD can be confined to the\n\u201cmemory-one\u201d strategies, in which the probability of\ncooperating in any round depends only on what happened in the previous\nmeeting between the strategies. The average payoff per round is again\nalways well-defined in the limit. The ideas of Press and Dyson have\ninspired much new work on the infinite IPD. (See\n Zero-Determinant Strategies\n below.) Since there is no last round, it is obvious that backward\ninduction does not apply to the infinite IPD.\n",
