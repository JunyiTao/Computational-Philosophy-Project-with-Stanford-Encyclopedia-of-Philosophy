    "main_text": "\n\nKant\u2019s views on aesthetics and teleology are most fully\npresented in his Critique of Judgment (Kritik der\nUrteilskraft, now often translated Critique of the Power of\nJudgment), published in\n 1790.[1]\n This work is in two parts, preceded by a long introduction in which\nKant explains and defends the work\u2019s importance to his critical\nsystem overall. In the first part, the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic\nJudgment\u201d, Kant discusses aesthetic experience and judgment, in\nparticular of the beautiful and the sublime, and also artistic\ncreation; in the second part, the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d, he discusses the role of teleology (that is, appeal\nto ends, purposes or goals) in natural science and in our\nunderstanding of nature more generally. The Critique of\nJudgment was the third and last of Kant\u2019s three\nCritiques, the other two being the Critique of Pure\nReason (1781, with a second edition in 1787), which deals with\nmetaphysics and epistemology, and the Critique of Practical\nReason of 1788, which, alongside his Groundwork of the\nMetaphysics of Morals of 1785, deals with ethics.\n\nAlthough interest in the Critique of Judgment has increased\nsubstantially over the last several decades, it has received less\nattention than the other two Critiques. One reason is that\nthe areas of aesthetics and natural teleology have traditionally been\nconsidered less philosophically central than those of ethics,\nmetaphysics and epistemology. Another is that it raises an\ninterpretive problem which has no analogue in the case of the other\nCritiques: that is, how to make sense of the work as a whole\ngiven the seeming disparity of the two parts, not only with each\nother, but also with the \u201cfaculty of judgment\u201d which is\nthe work\u2019s ostensible focus. However, Kant\u2019s aesthetic\ntheory has always been extremely influential within philosophical\naesthetics and the philosophy of art, and since the late 1970s there\nhas been a rapidly expanding literature on Kant\u2019s aesthetics\nwithin Anglo-American Kant interpretation. (Some of the growth in the\nliterature up to 2008 is documented in Guyer 2009.) Kant\u2019s views\non natural teleology, very much neglected in comparison to his\naesthetics, started to receive more attention in the early 1990s, and\nthere has been increased interest, during the last two decades in\nparticular, both in Kant\u2019s view of teleology in its own right,\nand in its potential relevance to contemporary philosophy of biology\nand to other areas in philosophy. Moreover, again since the 1990s,\nmore attention has been directed towards the project of interpreting\nthe Critique of Judgment as a coherent whole. With increased\nfocus on its general philosophical underpinnings, the third\nCritique has come to be seen not only as significant within\nthe disciplines of aesthetics and philosophy of biology, but also as\nplaying an important systematic role with respect to Kant\u2019s\nepistemology, metaphysics and ethics, and indeed, as relevant to\ncontemporary discussions in these, and related, areas.\n\nKant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology together comprise a very wide\nfield, and this article cannot cover all the relevant topics, nor take\naccount of all the relevant literature, especially given the recent\nexpansion of scholarly interest in the third Critique. I\nmention here three more specific limitations. First, although Kant\nwrote on aesthetics and teleology throughout his career, this article\nconsiders only Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment (along with\nthe so-called \u201cFirst Introduction\u201d, an earlier version of\nthe Introduction that was not published during Kant\u2019s lifetime\nbut that is included with the most recent English translations of the\nCritique of Judgment). Second, this article is concerned\nprimarily with the interpretive and philosophical issues raised by\nKant\u2019s writings on these topics, as opposed to historical\nquestions regarding their origin and reception. Third, the article\nfocusses primarily on those issues that have attracted most attention\nin the Anglo-American analytic tradition; this is reflected in the\nbibliography, which is largely restricted to works in English, and\nmore specifically works written from an analytic perspective. For some\nreferences to Kant\u2019s writings on aesthetics and teleology other\nthan the Critique of Judgment, see under Primary Sources in\nthe Bibliography. Some suggestions for secondary literature dealing\nwith the history and reception of Kant\u2019s aesthetics and\nteleology, and for secondary literature in English from a less\nanalytic perspective, are given under Secondary Sources in the\nBibliography.\n",
