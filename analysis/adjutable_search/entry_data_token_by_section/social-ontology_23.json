The paradigmatic examples are tools,\nsuch as hammers, knives, and cups, but the category of artifacts\nincludes more complex objects as well, such as cars, houses, and\ncomputers. Some theorists conceive of artifacts broadly enough that\nthe category includes nearly all social entities, from hammers to\nHamlet.\n\nThe standard rough characterization of an artifact is that it is an\nobject created by people to perform some function (see Hilpinen\n1992a, Dipert 1993; entry\non\n artifact).\n This characterization excludes objects that are used to perform\nfunctions but are not made by a person. A rock might be used as a\nhammer, or a piece of driftwood as decoration. Other objects are made\nby people but without any functional intention, such as scraps of\nmetal produced in making a blade. The functionality of an object can\nalso be de-coupled from its making: someone might, for instance,\ndecide that an unmodified pile of scrap metal is sculpture.\n\nThis definition requires an understanding of the role\u2014and\nperhaps the necessity\u2014of intention. Many objects that we presume\nto be artifacts are not accompanied by human intentions directly. A\nmachine, for example, might automatically hammer out thousands of\nblades, which the machine stacks into boxes. A particular blade in one\nof those boxes would typically be considered an artifact even though\nno human was ever aware of that blade\u2019s existence, to say\nnothing of having created it for a reason. Millikan (1984) argues that\ncertain entities can be understood as having \u201cderived\nfunctions\u201d, when their intended role is part of the explanation\nfor their being reproduced. Thomasson (2003, 2007) develops this idea\nfurther, arguing that the function of an artifact is always in\nprinciple knowable to the creator. Elder (2004, 2007) develops\nMillikan\u2019s approach in an opposing direction, arguing that\nartifacts are copied kinds but need not be accompanied by creator\nintention.\n\nThese and other accounts hold that artifacts ontologically depend on\nhistorical facts, often historical intentions of the creator. Others\nargue that the emphasis on historical processes is misguided, and that\nwhat matters is how an object is used in the present (Keil, Greif et\nal. 2007; Preston 2009, 2013). Not everyone agrees that artifacts must\nhave a function (or an intended function). Objects such as doodles and\nrock stacks are created without either functions or functional\nintentions. Even if artifacts necessarily involve functions, the role\nof functions in distinguishing artifactual kinds from one another\nmight be debated. It may be that artifactual kinds are individuated by\nfunction, but many artifactual kinds (such as houses) seem to have\nmultiple functions, and some sets of distinct artifactual kinds (such\nas bicycles and tricycles) may all have the same function.\n\nTheories of artifacts draw from the literature on the ontology of art\n(see, for instance, Bloom 1996, Levinson 2007), and many theories of\nartworks regard them to be kinds of artifacts (see Eaton 1969,\nIseminger 1973, Hilpinen 1992b, Thomasson 1999).\n\nProblems in the ontology of art include the ontological categories\ninto which artworks fall, the unity or diversity of kinds of entities\nwithin artistic domains and across domains (e.g., in painting,\nsculpture, music, dance), the individuation of particular artworks,\nthe definition of art in general, and the dynamic changes in artistic\ncategories. See entries on the\n definition of art,\n history of the ontology of art,\n the philosophy of music,\n the philosophy of dance,\n conceptual art,\n and\n the philosophy of digital art.\n",
