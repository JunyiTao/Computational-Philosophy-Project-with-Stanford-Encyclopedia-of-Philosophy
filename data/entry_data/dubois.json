    "preamble": "\n\nWilliam Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868\u20131963) believed that his\nlife acquired its only deep significance through its participation in\nwhat he called \u201cthe Negro problem,\u201d or, later, \u201cthe\nrace problem.\u201d Whether that is true or not, it is difficult to\nthink of anyone, at any time, who examined the race problem in its\nmany aspects more profoundly, extensively, and subtly than W.E.B. Du\nBois. Du Bois was an activist and a journalist, a historian and a\nsociologist, a novelist, a critic, and a philosopher\u2014but it is\nthe race problem that unifies his work in these many domains.\n\nDu Bois contributes to our specifically philosophical understanding of\nrace and the race problem, because he treats these themes as objects\nof philosophical consideration\u2014indeed, it is largely through an\nengagement with Du Bois\u2019s work that many contemporary\nphilosophers have come to appreciate race and race-related concerns as\nfruitful topics of philosophical reflection. Through his work in\nsocial philosophy, political philosophy, and the philosophy of art, Du\nBois, for all intents and purposes, invented the field of philosophy\nand race, thereby unsettling and revising our views of the proper\nscope and aims of philosophical inquiry.\n",

Du\nBois.  \n\n2. Social Philosophy, The Negro Problem, and Race\n\nOver the course of his career, Du Bois\u2019s social philosophy\ncomprised contributions to social ontology, social theory, the\nphilosophy of the human and social sciences, and the diagnosis of\nsocial\n problems.[1]\n His analysis of the nature of a social problem and, specifically, his\ndiagnosis of the Negro problem; his social constructionist accounts of\nrace and racial differences; his ongoing reflection on the methods,\npurposes, and sometimes moral significance of social inquiry; and his\nelaboration of the claim that the concept of race, operating as a\nmechanism of power, structures relations of social domination, all\nplayed a critical role in what he ultimately came to call his\n\u201cevolving program for Negro freedom\u201d (1944, 31). The\npresent section bears on Du Bois\u2019s analysis of the Negro problem\nand his contributions to the philosophy of race. Section 3, below,\nfocuses on his contributions to the philosophy of the social\nsciences.\n2.1 What is the Negro Problem?\n\nDu Bois considers the Negro Problem both objectively and\nsubjectively\u2014both from the standpoint of science and from the\nstandpoint of lived experience.\n2.1.1 The Negro Problem Objectively Considered\n\nIn \u201cThe Study of the Negro Problems\u201d (1898), one of his\nearliest publications, Du Bois responded to then contemporary\ndiscussions of America\u2019s \u201cNegro problem\u201d by\nconceptualizing the problem as an object of social scientific inquiry.\nSociology studies social phenomena, and the social phenomena that\ninterest Du Bois are the cluster of social problems affecting American\nNegroes (the Negro is not a problem, in his view, although problems\naffect the Negro [see Gordon, 2000]). In the perspective of sociology,\nthe Negro problem just is a cluster of social problems (1898,\n 77\u201378).[2]\n But what is a social\n problem?[3]\n\nDu Bois answers this question by defining a social problem as\n\u201cthe failure of an organized social group to realize its group\nideals, through the inability to adapt a certain desired line of\naction to given conditions of life\u201d (1898, 78). One example is\nthe failure to enact the ideal of a luxurious home life due to\nprevailing marriage customs. Another is the failure to enact the ideal\nof economic and social development due to crime and lawlessness.\n\nThe historical evolution of the social problems that Du Bois\nidentifies as Negro problems has been a \u201cbaffling adjustment of\naction and condition which is the essence of progress\u201d (1898,\n 82).[4]\n Turning to the present, Du Bois characterizes the then current (circa\n1898) Negro problems as so many failures to enact the ideal of\nincorporating the Negro masses into the group life of the American\npeople. Du Bois attributes these failures to two causes: white racial\nprejudice towards Negroes and Negro cultural backwardness. Racial\nprejudice is the conviction \u201cthat people of Negro blood should\nnot be admitted into the group life of the nation no matter what their\ncondition may be\u201d (1898, 82). Cultural backwardness is economic\ndisadvantage, ignorance, and deficiency with regard to the art of\norganized social life. Each of these causes accounts for one of two\ndistinct classes of Negro problems (1898,\n 82\u20133).[5]\n\nDu Bois\u2019s social ontology and causal explanation of Negro\nproblems lay the basis for his research agenda. The study of the Negro\nas a social group focuses on Negro problems that have arisen\nindependently of racial prejudice in the Negro\u2019s social\nenvironment. In turn, the study of the Negro\u2019s social\nenvironment considers Negro problems that have resulted from\nracial prejudice. Du Bois\u2019s program for studying the Negro as a\nsocial group includes historical study, statistical investigation,\nanthropological measurement, and sociological\n interpretation.[6]\n2.1.2 The Negro Problem Subjectively Considered\n\nIn Du Bois\u2019s view, the Negro Problem is a subjectively lived and\nfelt social condition, not only an object of social scientific\ninquiry. In \u201cStrivings of the Negro People\u201d (1897b) and\nThe Souls of Black Folk (1903a), Du Bois adduces the concept\nof double-consciousness to characterize the subjectively lived and\nfelt experience of the Negro problem. Ascribing double consciousness\nspecifically to the Negro, Du Bois characterizes it as a \u201csense\nof always looking at oneself through the eyes of others, of measuring\none\u2019s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused\ncontempt and pity\u201d (1903a, 3). In Du Bois\u2019s view,\ndouble-consciousness obtains when blacks see themselves through the\npitying and contemptuous eyes of the racially prejudiced whites whose\nracial prejudice is one of the causes of the Negro problem.\n\nThe concept of double-consciousness is the most extensively discussed\nconcept in the humanities and social sciences secondary literature on\nDu Bois, and it has received substantial attention from philosophers.\nThe present, brief discussion of the concept is intended simply to\nsituate it within the larger context of Du Bois\u2019s social\nphilosophy. For a more detailed account of Du Bois\u2019s\nunderstanding of double consciousness and a survey of contemporary\nphilosophical disputes about the content and significance of the\nconcept, see the entry on\n double consciousness.\n2.2 What is a Negro? What is a Race? What is Whiteness?\n\nIn \u201cThe Study of the Negro Problems,\u201d Du Bois predicates\nhis analysis of Negro problems on his analysis of social problems\nas such; in another early essay, \u201cThe Conservation of\nRaces\u201d (1897a), he similarly predicates his answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is a Negro?\u201d on an answer to a more\nfundamental question, \u201cWhat is a race?\u201d Du Bois turns to\nthe human sciences to say what a race is, but also to account for the\nexistence of spiritually distinct races. Du Bois\u2019s\nhistorical-sociological definition of race overlaps his\nhistorical-sociological explanation of the existence of\nspiritually distinct races. To put the point more precisely, and in an\nidiom that is familiar to contemporary philosophers, Du Bois holds\nthat the same sorts of historical and social factors construct race\nboth constitutively and\n causally.[7]\n\nWe begin by analyzing Du Bois\u2019s explanation of the\ndistinctiveness of distinct races. We then turn to his definition of\nrace, which he introduces to counter the objection that, because\nspiritually distinct races cannot be identified as races from\nthe perspective of the natural sciences, they cannot be identified as\nraces at all. After considering contemporary philosophers\u2019\nongoing debates about Du Bois\u2019s definition of race in\n\u201cConservation,\u201d we turn to Du Bois\u2019s later\ntreatments of race and the notion of whiteness in Dusk of\nDawn (1940), Black Reconstruction (1935), and \u201cThe\nSouls of White Folk\u201d (in Darkwater (1920)).\n2.2.1 Explaining Race\n\nIn explaining and defining race, Du Bois participates in a\nturn-of-the-century conversation in German philosophy about the\nsubjects and methods that distinguish the human from the natural\nsciences\u2014that is, the Geisteswissenschaften from the\nNaturwissenschaften. Responding to Auguste Comte\u2019s and\nJ.S. Mill\u2019s efforts to reform the human sciences on the model of\nthe natural sciences, German scholars addressed a variety of questions\nas to the human sciences\u2019 cognitive aims, possible\nmethodological autonomy, and dependence on psychology. When Du Bois\narrived in Berlin in 1892, the conversation was well underway and had\nalready benefitted from the significant contributions of Wilhelm\nDilthey and Wilhelm Wundt several years earlier. During the 1890s\nthere were further contributions, in particular the writings of Georg\nSimmel, Wilhelm Windelband, and Heinrich Rickert. Although Du Bois\ninitially presented \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d as an\naddress to the American Negro Academy, the essay was a significant\naddition to the German debate, for it marks Du Bois\u2019s turn from\nthe Naturwissenschaften to the Geisteswissenschaften\nto explain the differences between races and to conceptualize racial\n identities.[8]\n\nAlthough Du Bois\u2019s essay acknowledges, as the \u201cfinal word\nof science, so far,\u201d that physical differences distinguish\n\u201cat least two, perhaps three, great families of human\nbeings\u2014the whites and Negroes, possibly the yellow race\u201d\n(1897a, 52), it more importantly maintains that that there exist\neight, spiritually distinct races. It also maintains that each\nspiritually distinct race, as such, is causally constructed\nby historical and social factors, for it asserts that each spiritually\ndistinct race causally owes its spiritual distinctiveness (its\npeculiar message, which dictates its particular historical role) to\nsuch factors\u2014specifically, to the common histories, laws,\nreligions, habits of thought, and conscious strivings that have caused\nit to be the cohesive, spiritually distinct race it is (1897,\n54\u201356).\n\nDu Bois also holds that the spiritual distinctiveness of a\nsocio-historical race cannot be explained in terms of physical,\nbiological facts. Like Wilhelm Dilthey, whose Introduction to the\nHuman Sciences (1883) had appeared a decade before Du Bois heard\nhim lecture in Berlin, he expressly questions the possibility of\ncausal explanations that reduce spiritual facts and differences to\nbiological facts and\n differences.[9]\n Thus, Du Bois rejects the physio-biological reductionism\ncharacteristic of nineteenth century racial science: the thesis that\nphysical racial differences causally explain the spiritual and\ncultural differences between racial groups. Spiritual differences have\nhistorical and social causes (law, religion, and so on), which Du Bois\ntakes to be causally independent of biological racial facts (1897a,\n 54\u201355).[10]\n2.2.2 Defining Race\n\nHaving sketched a preliminary account of the \u201csubtle\nforces\u201d that have causally divided human beings into spiritually\ndistinct races, Du Bois writes that, while these races \u201cperhaps\ntranscend scientific definition, nevertheless, [they] are clearly\ndefined to the eye of the Historian and Sociologist\u201d (1897a,\n53).\n\nThat spiritually distinct groups may not be readily identified as\nraces if one adopts the perspective of the natural sciences does not\nentail that they cannot be identified as races at all. Reminiscent of\nDilthey, again, Du Bois holds that the natural sciences and the human\nsciences have distinct subject matters (physical facts, on the one\nhand, spiritual facts on the other), and suggests that the former,\nbecause they conceptualize human beings exclusively in physical terms,\ncannot conceptualize them in terms of social and historical facts, and\nthus cannot conceptualize them in terms of the social and historical\nfacts that define spiritually distinct groups as races (Du\nBois\u2019s reason for claiming that social and historical facts\n\u201ctranscend scientific definition\u201d). If, however, one\nadopts the perspective of the human sciences; if, in other words, one\nadopts the conceptual \u201ceyes\u201d of the historian and the\nsociologist, then one sees these social and historical facts standing\n\u201cclearly defined\u201d to one\u2019s point of view. From this\npoint of view, Du Bois proposes, it is possible to identify\nspiritually distinct races as\n races,[11]\n and thus to state a definition of race\u2014or, in other words, to\nspecify the historical and social factors that constitute a group of\nhuman beings as a race.\n\nWhat, then, is race? It is a vast family of human beings, generally of\ncommon blood and language, always of common history, traditions and\nimpulses, who are both voluntarily and involuntarily striving together\nfor the accomplishment of certain more or less vividly conceived\nideals of life (1897a, 53).\n\n\nHere, Du Bois\u2019s distinguishes between the factors that generally\n(usually) characterize a race and the factors that must\nalways characterize a race; that is, the factors that\nconstitute a group of people as a race. Du Bois\u2019s definition\nproposes that a group of human beings counts as a spiritually distinct\nrace if, and only if, the members of the group have a common history,\ncommon traditions and impulses, and common (voluntary and involuntary)\nstrivings; counting as members of a spiritually distinct race does not\nrequire a common blood or a common language, however, although the\nmembers of a spiritually distinct race may indeed speak the same\nlanguage or have the same blood coursing through their veins (see\nLott, 1992\u201393; Gooding-Williams, 1996 and 2009; and Sundstrom,\n2003). Du Bois\u2019s definition asserts that each spiritually\ndistinct race is, as such, constitutively constructed by the\nhistorical and social factors the definition specifies as making a\nrace a race.\n\nIt has not escaped notice that the list of historical and social\nfactors that Du Bois identifies as causally constructing (as\nexplaining) the existence and cohesiveness of spiritually distinct\nraces\u2014common histories, laws, religions, habits of thought, and\nconscious strivings\u2014echoes the list of factors he identifies as\nconstitutively constructing (as defining) a group of human beings as a\nspiritually distinct race\u2014common history, traditions, impulses,\nand strivings (see Gooding-Williams, 2009, 51). To be sure, the lists\nare not identical. Still, we can reasonably assume that Du Bois means\nthem to capture the same content, supposing that the traditions and\nimpulses indicated in the second list include legal and religious\ntraditions as well as persistent habits of thought. Du Bois holds not\nonly that historical and social factors constitutively and causally\nconstruct spiritually distinct races, but, likewise, that the same\nkinds of historical and social factors constitutively and\ncausally construct spiritually distinct races.\n\nWhat, then, is a Negro? To be a Negro, Du Bois replies, is 1) to be a\nmember of one of three biologically distinct races, and 2) to be a\nmember of one of eight constitutively and causally constructed\nspiritually distinct races. The Negro is spiritually distinguished\nfrom other spiritually distinct races by its distinctive message, the\ncontent of which, Du Bois argues, is not yet fully articulated (1897,\n55\u201356).\n2.2.3 Debating Du Bois\u2019s Explanation and Definition of Race\n\nContemporary philosophers have devoted considerable attention to Du\nBois\u2019s explanation and definition of race in \u201cThe\nConservation of Races;\u201d indeed, they have given more attention\nto Du Bois\u2019s definition than to his treatment of any other\nphilosophical issue. Nearly all that attention can be traced to Kwame\nAnthony Appiah\u2019s engagement with Du Bois in \u201cThe\nUncompleted Argument: Du Bois and the Illusion of Race\u201d (Appiah,\n1985), an expanded version of which Appiah published as the second\nchapter (\u201cIllusions of Race\u201d) of In My Father\u2019s\nHouse (Appiah, 1992).\n\nAppiah\u2019s critique of Du Bois (see Appiah, 1985 and Appiah,\n 1992[12])\n argues for three, key claims: 1) that Du Bois\u2019s definition of\nrace fails to state criteria that serve to individuate his eight,\nspiritually distinct races; 2) that, notwithstanding Du Bois\u2019s\nintention to conceptualize race in socio-historical terms, the\ncriteria he in fact uses to individuate spiritually distinct races\ncomprise a physical, biological component\u2014specifically, the idea\nof a common ancestry; and 3) that, notwithstanding his ongoing,\npost-\u201cConservation\u201d efforts to substitute \u201ca\nsociohistorical conception of race for the biological one,\u201d the\nlogic of his argument \u201cleads naturally to the final repudiation\nof race as a term of difference\u201d (Appiah, 1985, 34\u201335).\nAppiah endorses this conclusion, stating that \u201c[t]he truth is\nthat there are no races,\u201d and that \u201cthe notion [of race]\nthat Du Bois required, and that underlies the most hateful racisms of\nthe modern era, refers to nothing in the world at all\u201d (Appiah,\n1992, 45).\n\nFor the most part, philosophical criticism of Appiah\u2019s reading\nof Du Bois has targeted his analysis of Du Bois\u2019s definition and\nhis antirealism about race. In an early response to Appiah, Lucius\nOutlaw (1996, 28) argues that Du Bois\u2019s definition of race is\nthe articulation of a cluster concept, and not, as Appiah presumes,\nthe statement of a set of conditions individually necessary and\njointly sufficient to constitute a group of people as a\n race.[13]\n In addition, Outlaw (1996, 21\u201322, 28) defends, and attributes\nto Du Bois, a version of racial realism, according to which biological\nancestry and physical characteristics play a role in defining\nrace.\n\nOther critics of Appiah\u2019s reading of Du Bois have been less\ninclined than Outlaw to defend or to attribute to Du Bois a definition\nof race involving biological characteristics; rather they have tended\nto argue that, Appiah\u2019s arguments to the contrary, Du Bois\nsucceeded in advancing a plausible, non-biological, socio-historical\ndefinition of race. Paul Taylor (2000), for example, takes issue with\nAppiah\u2019s claim that Du Bois\u2019s appeal to \u201ccommon\nhistory\u201d as a criterion of individuation is circular, arguing\nthat Appiah misconstrues Du Bois\u2019s understanding of what it\nmeans for two individuals to have a history in\n common.[14]\n Ronald Sundstrom (2003) also defends Du Bois\u2019s socio-historical\ndefinition, arguing that, on a metaphysical pluralist reading, it can\ndo the work of individuation that Appiah says it cannot do. For Taylor\nand Sundstrom, Du Bois was a racial realist who cogently defended the\nthesis that race is a social kind.\n\nMore recently, Chike Jeffers and Robert Bernasconi have productively\nre-oriented the philosophical discussion of \u201cConservation\u201d\naway from debates stemming from Appiah\u2019s interpretation of the\n essay.[15]\n On Bernasconi\u2019s account, these debates have tended to\nanachronism, and so tended to overlook the context-specific intentions\nanimating Du Bois\u2019s essay. In Jeffers\u2019s view, the\nAppiah-inspired debates have missed a key distinction shaping Du\nBois\u2019s social constructionism.\n\nAccording to Bernasconi, recent philosophical discussions of Du\nBois\u2019s explanation and definition of race \u201chave tended to\ndistort its meaning by imposing an alien question on it\u201d (2009,\n519). Rather than read \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d in\nlight of contemporary arguments about racial eliminativism (about\nwhether, in Appiah\u2019s words, race should be repudiated as a term\nof difference) and the proper referent of the concept of race,\nBernasconi places Du Bois\u2019s essay in its immediate political and\nhistorical setting. Specifically, he emphasizes Du Bois\u2019s\nengagements with the thought of Edward Wilmot Blyden, Alexander\nCrummell and Frederick Douglass and argues that the intended point of\nthe essay was \u201cto give hope to blacks at a time when scientists\nwere questioning their future on the basis of suspicions about the\nimpact of race mixing on their capacity to survive the struggle for\nexistence\u201d (2009,\n 536).[16]\n With Bernasconi\u2019s intervention, debate about Du Bois\u2019s\n1897 essay has turned to the metaphilosophical question of the\nrelative value of anachronistic (presentist) and antiquarian\n(historicist) approaches to the study of the history of African\nAmerican philosophy (see, e.g., Taylor, 2013 and Gooding-Williams,\n2017).\n\nAccording to Jeffers (2013), the Appiah-inspired discussion of Du Bois\nhas ignored the distinction Du Bois draws between political and\ncultural versions of the thesis that race is constitutively\n constructed.[17]\n The political version of the thesis, which Du Bois rejects, Jeffers\nargues, holds that \u201c\u2018racialized\nsubordination\u2019\u2026constitutes its [race\u2019s] very\nexistence\u201d (2013,\n 413).[18]\n The cultural version, which Du Bois endorses, Jeffers argues, holds\nthat the cultural factors mentioned in Du Bois\u2019s definition\n(traditions, ideals of life, and so on) constitutively construct races\nas \u201cdistinct cultures\u201d (2013, 411). Jeffers\ndescribes the cultural version of socio-historical constructionism\nthat he attributes to Du Bois as Du Bois\u2019s \u201ccultural\ntheory of\n race.\u201d[19]\n\nJeffers advances criticisms of Du Bois\u2019s definition of race and,\nunlike most other philosopher commentators, of his causal explanation\nof the existence of spiritually and culturally distinct races.\nRegarding the latter, he questions the reliability of Du Bois\u2019s\ngeneral, historical account of the genesis of the social factors to\nwhich Du Bois attributes the existence of these races (Jeffers, 2013,\n417). Regarding the former, he adduces an important conceptual point:\nnamely, that Du Bois neglects to justify the assumption that the\nhistorical and social facts that define and distinguish the\nspiritually distinct groups that the historian and the sociologist\nidentify as races should be thought to constitute (constitutively to\nconstruct) those groups as races. Perhaps they serve simply\nto constitute them as cultural entities, or, as Du Bois himself\nsometimes writes, as nations (Jeffers, 2013, 416). Absent that\nassumption, neither the historian nor the sociologist is entitled to\nidentify the clearly defined, spiritually distinct groups he or she\nobserves as races. And, absent that assumption, Du Bois is\nhardly entitled to present the definition that he bases on what the\nhistorian and the sociologist observe as answering the question,\n\u201cWhat, then, is a\n race?\u201d[20]\n\nNotwithstanding his criticisms of Du Bois, Jeffers, following Outlaw\n(1996), endorses and defends Du Bois\u2019s \u201cstrong commitment\nto the preservation and cultivation of black cultural\ndifference\u201d (Jeffers, 2013,\n 419).[21]\n Jeffers has also shown that Du Bois maintains that commitment\nthroughout his intellectual career (Jeffers, 2017).\n2.2.4 Rethinking Race\n\nPhilosophers interested in Du Bois\u2019s thinking about race in\nwritings he essayed after the publication of \u201cThe Conservation\nof Races\u201d have tended to focus on Dusk of Dawn (1940).\nIn this connection, both Paul Taylor (2000, 2004a, 2004b, and 2014)\nand Robert Gooding-Williams (2014) have elaborated detailed accounts\nof the notion of race that Du Bois sketches in the book he subtitled\n\u201cAn Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept.\u201d In a\nrelated vein, Joel Olson (2004), Shannon Sullivan (2006), Terrance\nMacmullen (2009), Robert Gooding-Williams (2021), and Ella Myers\n(2022) have examined Du Bois\u2019s conceptualization of whiteness,\ngiving particular attention to the the development of Du Bois\u2019s\nthought during the interwar period\u2014roughly from the 1920\npublication of \u201cThe Souls of White Folk\u201d (see chapter 2 of\nDarkwater (1920)) through the publication of Dusk of\nDawn twenty years later. Olson reads Dusk of Dawn as\nadvancing an argument Du Bois initiates in Black\nReconstruction (1935), and Sullivan and Macmullen read it as\nadvancing an argument that Du Bois initiates in \u201cThe Souls of\nWhite Folk.\u201d Gooding-Williams focuses on exclusively on\n\u201cThe Souls of White Folk.\u201d Myers provides the most\ncomprehensive scholarly treatment to-date of Du Bois\u2019s\nconceptualization of whiteness during the interwar period, with\ndetailed, individual chapters on\u201cThe Souls of White Folk,\u201d\nBlack Reconstruction, and Dusk of Dawn.\n2.2.4.1 Riding Jim Crow in Georgia\n\nIn chapter 6 of Dusk of Dawn, entitled \u201cThe White\nWorld,\u201d Du Bois imagines a dialogue between himself and a\nfictional interlocutor, Roger Van Dieman. Near the conclusion of the\nexchange, Du Bois says that \u201c[r]ace is a cultural, sometimes an\nhistorical fact,\u201d to which Van Dieman responds \u201cBut what\nis this group [the black race] and how do you differentiate it\u201d\n(1940, 77). Du Bois rejoins his interlocutor, remarking that he\nrecognizes \u201cit [the black race] quite easily and with full legal\nsanction; the black man is a person who must ride Jim Crow in\nGeorgia\u201d (1940, 77).\n\nHere, Du Bois seems to reject biological concepts of race, and while\nhe asserts that race is a cultural and sometimes an historical fact,\nhis reference to the Jim Crow car suggests that he is no longer\nconceptualizing the Negro or any race as a group united by a distinct\nspiritual message. But if the cultural and sometimes historical fact\nof race is neither a biological nor a spiritual fact, what sort of\nfact is it?\n\nOn Taylor\u2019s account, Du Bois means to answer this question by\nproposing that race is an institutional fact. Following John\nSearle (1995), Taylor understands institutional facts, like marriage\nand money, to be ontologically subjective and epistemologically\nobjective (2000, 110; 2004a, 109; 2004b, 91). Realizing that\n\u201ccollective intentionality can bring certain facts into\nbeing\u201d (2000, 110), Taylor\u2019s Du Bois understood race to be\nconstitutively constituted by human mental states (2004,\n 109).[22]\n2.2.4.2 Du Bois, Genealogy, Race\n\nGooding-Williams interprets Dusk of Dawn as defending a\ngenealogical concept of race. Taking Du Bois\u2019s subtitle as\nindicative of his larger philosophical aims, he argues that Du\nBois\u2019s essay toward the autobiography of a race concept is a\nmode of conceptual analysis that historicizes the concept of race. Due\nto the affinity of Du Bois\u2019s philosophical strategy to Friedrich\nNietzsche\u2019s approach to the analysis of concepts,\nGooding-Williams describes that strategy as\n\u201cgenealogical.\u201d\n\nNietzsche thought that making sense of the concept of punishment must\nbe a matter of unpacking the dense, synthesis of meanings (purposes,\nfunctions) that, over time, have been willfully interpreted into and\nforcibly imposed on specific procedures for inflicting harm\n(Nietzsche, 1998, 50\u201354). More generally, he understood that\nconceptual analysis can take the form of genealogy\u2014that is, of\nhistorical inquiry that separates the distinct meanings that have been\njoined together and even conflated through episode after episode of\nreinterpreting one and the same, more or less stable set of phenomena\n(procedures, complexes of habits, feeling, ways of perceiving, and so\n forth).[23]\n In sum, Nietzsche held that historically formed concepts, like our\nnotion of punishment, \u201care like ropes held together by the\nintertwining of strands, rather than by a single strand running\nthrough the whole thing\u201d (Clark, 1994, 22). To analyze such\nconcepts, he argued, \u201cis not to find necessary and sufficient\nconditions for their use but to disentangle the various strands that\nhave become so tightly woven together by the process of historical\ndevelopment that they seem inseparable\u201d (Clark, 1994, 22)\n\nOn Gooding-Williams\u2019s account, Du Bois 1) treats differences in\nthe color of men as the more or less stable set of phenomena\nundergirding the concept of race, and 2) characterizes the concept of\nrace as an intricate web of manifold and often conflicting\ninterpretations of those differences formed over the course of his\nlifetime. Autobiography, a narrative form of historical inquiry, is\nthe vehicle through which Du Bois genealogically analyzes that web of\ninterpretations, for to reconstruct the story of his life is, in his\nview, to disentangle these interpretations, one from the other, in\norder to show that and how they have been exemplified in his life\n(Gooding-Williams, 2014,\n 166\u2013167).[24]\n\nThus, Du Bois worries that what he has called a \u201crace\nconcept\u201d is not, strictly speaking, a concept, for he sees that\nit is not the sort of concept that can be defined by specifying a set\nof non-contradictory and hence logically coherent conditions for its\nproper application. Contradiction can inhabit the race concept,\nbecause Du Bois, like Nietzsche, allows that historically formed\nconcepts may comprise discordant interpretations of the meaning of one\nand the same set of phenomena. The race concept is\n\u201cillogical,\u201d but is not for that reason without the\nefficacy characteristic of \u201cforces,\u201d \u201cfacts,\u201d\nand \u201ctendencies\u201d (Du Bois, 1940, 67). Indeed, the efficacy\nof the concept is such that, internal inconsistencies notwithstanding,\nit has dominated Du Bois\u2019s life. Du Bois\u2019s exemplification\nof the race concept is his subjection to it. Reminiscent, again, of\nNietzsche, he holds that historically formed concepts can function as\nmechanisms of power and control (Gooding-Williams, 2014,\n 167).[25]\n2.2.4.3 The Power, Moral Psychology, and Gratifications of Whiteness\n\nAccording to Joel Olson (2004), Du Bois\u2019s understanding of\nwhiteness belongs to the political theory of race he begins to sketch\nin Black Reconstruction. Specifically, Du Bois conceptualizes\nwhiteness as a privileged position of social standing that has 1)\nafforded white workers a public and psychological wage compensating\nthem for their low economic wages; and 2) formed the basis of a\ncross-class, political alliance uniting white workers and capitalists\nagainst black workers (black slaves included). More generally, he\nmaintains that whiteness has historically functioned as a mechanism of\npower for recruiting white workers to police and reinforce the\neconomic exploitation of black workers. On Olson\u2019s account, Du\nBois explains the \u201csplendid failure\u201d of Reconstruction and\nthe genesis of the American racial order through his analysis of the\ncross-class political alliance of white workers and capitalists\n(Olson, 16, 30).\n\nIn Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois further develops his understanding\nof whiteness by interpreting racial oppression as, in Olson\u2019s\nwords, \u201ca political problem of dark and white worlds arrayed\nagainst each other, with the white world determined to subordinate the\ndark one\u201d (Olson, 22). Placing the conceptual opposition between\nwhite and dark (or non-white) worlds at the center of his analysis, Du\nBois especially emphasizes the role whiteness plays in legitimizing\nthe \u201cdomination of white Europe over black Africa and yellow\nAsia\u201d (Du Bois, 1940, 48; see, also, Du Bois, 1940, 85\u201387;\nand Olson 26, 155, fn.60).\n\nAccording to Gooding-Williams (2021), \u201cThe Souls of White\nFolk\u201d can be read as Du Bois\u2019s central contribution to the\nmoral psychology of white supremacy; that is, as his account of the\naffective, motivational, and cognitive dispositions that constitute\nwhite supremacism as a morally vicious character\ntrait\u2014including, e.g., the dispositions passionately to hate\nblack folk; to slander and murder black folk; and to believe that\nwhite folk are inherently better than black\n folk.[26]\n In \u201cThe White World\u201d chapter of Dusk of Dawn, Du\nBois complicates this earlier psychological portrait of the white\nsupremacist, stressing the deeply ingrained persistence of her or his\nracist behavior. Du Bois argues, for example, that \u201cthe present\nattitude and action of the white world\u2026is a matter of\nconditioned reflexes; of long followed habits, customs and folkways;\nof subconscious trains of reasoning and unconscious nervous\nreflexes\u201d (Du Bois, 1940, 87). Productively building on Du\nBois\u2019s moral psychology, Shannon Sullivan (2006) and Terrance\nMacmullen (2009) have recently brought Du Bois into conversation with\nJohn Dewey to develop pragmatist, habit-centered accounts of the\nworkings of white privilege.\n\nConsidering Du Bois\u2019s middle-period (roughly 1920\u20131940) oeuvre\nas a whole, Ella Myers has recently and persuasively argued that Du\nBois analyzes whiteness in multiple registers (material,\npsychological, affective, libidinal and spiritual)\u2014thus, not\nexclusively in the political theoretical and moral psychological terms\nthat Olson, Gooding-Williams, Sullivan and McMulllen highlight. On\nMyers account, we can fruitfully read Du Bois as arguing that\nwhiteness affords white citizens any number of\n\u201cgratifictions,\u201d including but not restricted to\nracialized self-esteem, the pleasures derived from anti-black\nviolence, and a sense of entitlement lived as a sort of existential\nfaith (Myers 2022).\n3. The Science of Human Action and Social Reform\n\nIn \u201cA Program for a Sociological Society\u201d (ca. 1897), an\nearly essay belonging to the same period as \u201cThe Study of the\nNegro Problems\u201d and \u201cThe Conservation of Races,\u201d Du\nBois places the emergence of the science of sociology in historical\nperspective. Prior to the industrial revolution, he argues, there was\nbut one science that studied the phenomenon of human action: namely,\npolitical economy. Political economy focused on the production,\ndistribution, and exchange of goods under stable social conditions,\nbut gave no attention to the intensification of problems of crime,\ndisease, poverty, prostitution, and ignorance that came with\n\u201cthe new concentration of industrys [sic], crowded into centers\nof population.\u201d Sociology addresses these problems, demanding a\n\u201cwider inquiry into the causes and scope of human action.\u201d\nMore generally, \u201c[s]ociology is\u2026the name given to that\nvast field of inquiry into human action as manifested in modern\norganized life.\u201d\n\nBut what is the point of sociological inquiry\u2014that is, of a\nsociological science of human action? Du Bois distinguishes between\nthe immediate and the mediate aims of scientific inquiry; that is,\nbetween the aims of science itself and the uses of scientific results\nby \u201cmerchants, physicians, men of letters, and\nphilanthropists\u201d\u2014indeed, by \u201call men\u201d (Du Bois\n1897, 89; see also Du Bois, ca.1897, 1\u201310). For Du Bois, the\nimmediate aim of science is knowledge; the mediate aims may vary, but\nsocial reform is the mediate aim upon which Du Bois focuses throughout\nhis career (see Green and Driver, 312\u2013313; Lewis, 1993,\n225\u201326; Reed, 47; and, especially, Bright, 5\u20137). But how\ncan scientific knowledge advance social reform? Du Bois sketches at\nleast three distinct answers to this question, each of which\ncorresponds to a different conception of the object of social\nscientific\n knowledge.[27]\n Knowledge of social laws and regularities can help the reformer to\nsettle on effective plans of action; knowledge of the scope and limits\nof chance can help her to hedge her bets\u2014that is, to guard\nagainst the possibility that her plans of action will fail; finally,\nknowledge of moral facts can help the reformer to caution her fellow\ncitizens against the disaster and sorrow that await them should they\npersist in an immoral course of action.\n3.1 Social Laws and Regularities\n\nIn an early statement (Du Bois, ca. 1897), Du Bois maintains that the\norganization of modern society is a function of social laws and\nregularities that sociology identifies through detailed, statistical\nresearch that \u201cgeneralizes[s]\u201d a \u201cmass of\nfacts,\u201d showing how various social phenomena, including, e.g.,\nthe \u201cdegree of poverty, the prevalence of suicide, [and] the\nextent and kinds of crime,\u201d tend \u201cto a certain rhythm and\nregularity which we call the social group\u201d (ca. 1897, 4).\nKnowledge of these social rhythms, regularities and, sometimes, laws\n(sociology studies \u201chuman action which by its regularity gives\nevidence of the presence of laws\u201d) is the \u201cfirst\nstep\u201d in modern social reform (ca. 1897, 3, 8). Such knowledge\ncan contribute to social reform, Du Bois\u2019s examples suggest, for\nit enables the reformer to explain causally the conditions she wishes\nto transform and rationally to chart plans to alter those conditions:\ne.g., the death rate of children in the slums, the treatment of\nprisoners, and pauperism (ca. 1897,\n 9\u201311).[28]\n Such knowledge, presumably, empowers Du Bois in his capacity as a\nsocial reformer to explain the existence of the Negro problem and\nrationally to identify means to eradicate the Negro problem (see 2.1\nabove and 4.1.1 below).\n3.2 The Scope and Limits of Chance\n\nIn \u201cSociology Hesitant\u201d (ca. 1905), perhaps his most\ntheoretically rich contribution to the philosophy of the human\nsciences, Du Bois takes issue with Comte\u2019s and Spencer\u2019s\ncollectivist\n holism[29]\u2014the\n thesis that society is a concrete whole (for Du Bois, a\n\u201cmystical whole\u201d) formed of discrete units\u2014and he\nagain defends the view that society comprises the \u201cdeeds of\nmen,\u201d as well as the \u201claw, rule, and rythm\u201d [sic]\ngoverning those deeds (ca. 1905, 274). For Du Bois, sociology is the\nscience of human action, not the science of society as such, or the\nscience of society as a whole.\n\nWhy, Du Bois asks, did Comte \u201chesitate so strangely\u201d\nbefore the prospect of treating human action as the proper object of\nsociological inquiry? The answer, Du Bois claims, is the \u201cGreat\nAssumption\u2026that in the deeds of men there lies along with\nrhythm and rule\u2026something incalculable\u201d\u2014an\nassumption in light of which the prospect of launching a science that\n\u201cwould discover and formulate the exact laws of human\naction\u2026seemed to be and was preposterous\u201d (ca. 1905,\n274). Comte wavered before what Du Bois calls \u201cParadox:\u201d\non one hand, \u201cThe evident rhythm of human action;\u201d on the\nother, \u201cThe evident incalculability of human action\u201d (ca.\n1905, 275). Where Comte wavers, however, Du Bois sallies forth,\nwriting \u201c[w]hy not\u2026flatly face the Paradox? frankly state\nthe Hypothesis of Law and the Assumption of Chance and seek to\ndetermine by study and measurement the limits of each\u201d (ca.\n1905, 276).\n\nHuman conduct is subject to the \u201cprimary\u201d rhythms of\nphysical law, as well as to the \u201csecondary\u201d rhythms of\nsocial regularities; social regularities exhibit \u201cnearly\u201d\nthe same uniformity as physical law, and they are also \u201cliable\nto stoppage and change\u201d (ca. 1905, 278). Aspiring to unite the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the\nNaturwissenschaften\u2014\u201cthe science of man and\nphysical science\u201d\u2014Du Bois characterizes sociology as\n\u201cassuming the data of physics and studying within these that\nrealm where determinate force is acted on by human wills, by\nindeterminate force\u201d (ca. 1905, 277\u2013278).\n\nPhysical laws and social regularities alike limit the scope of chance,\nwhich is to say that they limit the scope of\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d force, or \u201cundetermined\u201d\nchoice, or, as Du Bois likewise puts the point, of \u201cfree\u201d\nand \u201cinexplicable\u201d will (ca. 1905, 276\u2013278). In\npresupposing chance, sociology presupposes free will.\nSociology\u2019s attempt to measure chance and free will is its\nattempt to measure the degree to which physical and social\nregularities limit and constrain the range of choice and action that\nis \u201cundetermined by and independent of actions gone\nbefore\u201d(ca. 1905, 278).\n\nSome forty years after Du Bois wrote \u201cSociology Hesitant,\u201d\nhe appears to allude to the earlier, then unpublished essay; indeed,\nhe reflects at length on the argument of the essay, suggesting that it\nmarked the beginning of a shift in his \u201cwhole attitude towards\nthe social sciences\u201d (1944, 56):\n\n\nThen, too, for what Law was I searching? In accord with what\nunchangeable scientific law was the world of interracial discord\naround me working? I fell back upon my Royce and James and deserted\nSchmoller and Weber. I saw the action of physical law in the actions\nof men; but I saw more than that: I saw rhythms and tendencies;\ncoincidence and probabilities; and I saw that, which for want of\nanother word, I must in accord with strict tenets of Science, call\nChance. I went forward to build a sociology, which I conceived as the\nattempt to measure the element of Chance in human conduct. This was\nthe Jamesian pragmatism, applied not simply to ethics, but to all\nhuman action, beyond what seemed to me, increasingly, the distinct\nlimits of physical law.\n\nMy work assumed from now on a certain tingling challenge of risk; what\nthe \u201cCaptain of Industry\u201d of that day was experiencing in\n\u201ckick,\u201d from money changing, railway consolidation and\ncorporation floating, I was, in what appeared to me on a large scale,\nessaying in the relations of men of daily life (1944,\n 57\u201358).[30]\n\n\nDu Bois\u2019s references to Weber, Schmoller, Royce, James, and\nJamesian pragmatism tie his earlier critique of Comte to an engagement\nwith what James dubbed \u201cthe dilemma of determinism\u201d\n(James, 1884). Weber was methodologically agnostic with regard to the\ndispute between metaphysical determinists and indeterminists, arguing\nthat neither position entailed consequences bearing on the research\npractices of the historical and cultural sciences, and taking\nSchmoller to task for his profession of faith in metaphysical\ndeterminism (see Weber, 1905a, 197\u2013196, 278; Ringer, 1997,\n57\u201358, 91). Thus, Du Bois breaks with both his German teachers\nin insisting that chance\u2014again, incalculable actions (and\nchoices) undetermined by and independent of actions gone\nbefore\u2014exists in the world and in explicitly endorsing\n\u201cthe assumption of chance\u201d as a principle of sociological\n method.[31]\n Du Bois\u2019s contention that the individual is free to the extent\nthat her choices escape explanation in terms of physical and social\nlaws and regularities echoes Royce\u2019s argument that, because\n\u201cthe individual as such is never the mere result of law,\u201d\nno causal explanation can \u201cpredetermine\u201d what she\n\u201cuniquely wills\u201d (Royce, 1899, 467\u2013468). Du Bois\nmisleads, however, when he retrospectively suggests that the argument\nof \u201cSociology Hesitant\u201d aligned him with James.\n\nTo be sure, Du Bois\u2019s language and analysis owe a debt\nto James\u2019s \u201cThe Dilemma of Determinism\u201d (1884) and,\nin particular, to James\u2019s conceptualization of the will\u2019s\nindependence (its ability to choose courses of action not fixed\n\u201cby parts of the universe already laid down\u201d (1884, 150))\nin terms of the concept of chance\u2014a debt Du Bois acknowledges\nwhen he describes his view as \u201cJamesian pragmatism.\u201d James\nexplains the ethical implications of his indeterminism when he takes\nissue with Schopenhauer, \u201cwho enforces his determinism by the\nargument that with a given fixed character only one reaction is\npossible under given circumstances\u201d (1879, 13). Schopenhauer\nforgets, James argues, that \u201cin these critical ethical moments,\nwhat consciously seems to be in question is the very\ncomplexion of the character\u201d (1879, 13). As a sociologist, Du\nBois\u2019s purports to have applied Jamesian pragmatism beyond the\nsphere of ethics, to \u201call human action,\u201d but it is\nprecisely here that he breaks with James; for notwithstanding his\ndefense of indeterminism, James is skeptical of the possibility of\nmeasuring the degree to which the will is free (James, 1890, 572). In\naddition, James insists that the science of psychology must\nmethodologically reject the assumption of chance. Psychology\n\u201cabstracts from free-will without necessarily denying its\nexistence\u201d (James, 1892,\n 457).[32]\n\nDu Bois was no less interested in determining (again, \u201cby study\nand measurement\u201d) the limits of law than he was in determining\nthe limits of chance. Law, he believed, marked the limit of chance,\nand chance, he believed, marked the limit of law. Knowledge of social\nlaws and regularities can contribute to social reform by enabling the\nsocial reformer causally to explain social problems and rationally to\nchart plans to solve those problems. Knowledge of the element of\nchance\u2014or, more exactly, of the scope and limits of chance in\norganized, modern social life\u2014can contribute to social reform by\nenabling the reformer to gauge the extent to which implementing his\nideas would entail experimenting with (\u201cessaying\u201d) plans\nof action that, due to the play of chance, carry a significant risk of\nfailure\u2014plans that he could not confidently endorse, despite his\nknowledge of the social laws and regularities shaping modern social\nlife. Just as knowledge of the scope and limits of chance could\nprovide the \u201cCaptain of Industry\u201d who speculates in\ncurrency and trades in floated, corporate stock a reason to modify his\ninvestment decisions, so too could it provide the reformer a reason to\nmodify his plans of action and similarly to meet the \u201ctingling\nchallenge of\n risk.\u201d[33]\n3.3 Historical Inquiry and Moral Knowledge\n\nIn \u201cThe Propaganda of History,\u201d the final chapter of\nBlack Reconstruction (1935), Du Bois maintains that\n\u201cscientific\u201d historiography\u2014that is, historiography\nthat \u201cset[s] down\u201d the record of \u201chuman\naction\u201d with \u201caccuracy and faithfulness of\ndetail\u201d\u2014can serve the ends of social reform; it can be\nused, he writes, \u201cas a measuring rod and guidepost for the\nfuture of nations\u201d (Du Bois, 1935, 584). Du Bois\u2019s\nargument for this claim proceeds through a defense of four theses: 1)\nthat the study of history, so far as it belongs to the science of\nhuman action, cannot model itself exclusively on the natural sciences;\n2) that accuracy in chronicling and explaining human action requires\nthat the historian rely on the method of interpretive\nunderstanding\u2014what Max Weber called Verstehen; 3) that,\ncontra Weber, accurate, empirically sound historiography reports moral\nknowledge; and 4) that the knowledge of morality and moral\nresponsibility yielded by the scientific study of human history (by\naccurate historiography) can contribute to social reform, for the\nphilosopher and the prophet can use that knowledge to guide mankind in\nthe solution of social problems (1935, 591).\n\nDu Bois criticizes histories that discuss slavery with moral\n\u201cimpartially,\u201d depicting America as helpless and the south\nas blameless, while explaining the difference in development, North\nand South, as \u201ca sort of working out of cosmic social and\neconomic law\u201d (1935, 585). An example of this sort of history is\nCharles and Mary Beard\u2019s The Rise of American\nCivilization, which treats the clash between north and south as\nif it were a clash between winds and waters. In the Beard\u2019s\n\u201csweeping mechanistic interpretation\u201d of history, Du Bois\nwrites, \u201cthere is no room for the real plot of the story, for\nthe clear mistake and guilt of rebuilding a new slavery of the working\nclass in the midst of a fateful experiment in democracy; for the\ntriumph of sheer moral courage and sacrifice in the abolition crusade;\nand for the hurt and struggle of degraded black millions in their\nfight for freedom and their attempt to enter democracy. Can all this\nbe omitted and half suppressed in a treatise that calls itself\nscientific?\u201d (1935, 585).\n\nAt issue here, again, as in \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d\nand \u201cSociology Hesitant,\u201d is the relation between the\nhuman sciences and the natural sciences. For the Du Bois of\nBlack Reconstruction, historians who model their inquiry\nexclusively on the natural sciences (historians like the Beards) seek\nto identify the causal uniformities (\u201ccosmic\u201d laws)\ngoverning human events, which events they conceptualize by analogy to\nthe behavior of the winds, waters and other forces of nature. The\nproblem here, Du Bois believes, is not with the effort to identify the\ncausal uniformities governing human events. Rather it is with the\ntendency in that effort to neglect the human meaning of human events,\nand thus to treat those events as inhuman, natural forces that lend\nthemselves to a purely \u201cmechanistic\u201d explanation\u2014by\nwhich Du Bois means explanation in terms that make no reference to the\nmeanings that the human subjects who participate in those events\nattach to them.\n\nIf history is to be a science of human action and not to pretend to be\na science of nature, then, Du Bois believes, it must take account of\nthe subjective meanings of actions and events. Du Bois implies that\nthe historian cannot truly tell the story of \u201cthe mightiest\neffort of the mightiest century\u201d (the struggle of enslaved\nblacks to achieve democracy) without taking account of the\n\u201cpsychology\u201d of the agents whose actions sustained that\neffort\u2014for to take psychology into account is to take subjective\nmeaning into account (1935, 586). More generally, Du Bois insists that\nthe historian of slavery ask: \u201cJust what did [slavery] mean to\nthe owner and the owned\u201d(1935, 585).\n\nTo understand slavery, knowing what it meant to the owned is no less\nimportant than knowing what it meant to the owners. In demanding that\nthe historian of slavery attend to the slaves\u2019 stories about\nslavery in order to know what slavery meant to the slaves, Du Bois\npresupposes the fundamental, methodological tenet that the\nhistorian\u2019s primary charge is what Max Weber called\nVerstehen, or \u201cinterpretive understanding,\u201d\nnot mechanical explanation. According to Weber, the sciences\nof human action, including history and sociology, \u201cspeak of\n\u2018action\u2019 insofar as the acting individual attaches\nsubjective meaning to his behavior\u2014be it overt or covert\u201d\n(1922, 38, 41). One of the aims of Verstehen, he argues, is\nrationally to make sense of the motivation prompting an action by\nplacing that action \u201cin an intelligible and more inclusive\ncontext of meaning\u201d\u2014as when, for example, we interpret a\nwoodchopper\u2019s chopping of wood as an act undertaken to secure a\nwage; or, alternatively, to provide a supply of firewood for the\nwoodchopper\u2019s use (1922, 42).\n\nDu Bois stresses the importance of interpretive understanding because\nhe is committed to the view that moral judgment is a critical\ncomponent of historiography. Thus, while Du Bois methodologically\naligns himself with Weber in stressing the importance of interpretive\nunderstanding to the scientific study of history, he methodologically\nrejects Weber\u2019s claim that \u201cconcern on the part of history\nto judge of historical actions as responsible before the conscience of\nhistory\u2026would suspend its character as empirical science\u201d\n(Weber, 1905b,\n 123).[34]\n\nUnlike Weber, Du Bois is a moral realist who believes that historical\ninquiry can afford us knowledge of moral facts\u2014knowledge, that\nis, of the proper distribution of moral responsibility and of the\nextent to which actions are right or wrong. But to obtain that\nknowledge, historians must understand human action in terms of\nsubjective meanings, for they require some such understanding of human\naction to render intelligible their application of the vocabulary of\nmoral evaluation\u2014for Du Bois, a vocabulary that includes the\nlanguage of \u201cguilt,\u201d of \u201cmoral courage and\nsacrifice,\u201d and of \u201cthe degraded black millions.\u201d Du\nBois argues that a necessary condition of the possibility of acquiring\nknowledge of moral facts through the historian\u2019s practice of the\nscience of human action is a Verstehen-centered approach to\nthat practice\u2014or, more exactly, an approach that explains human\nactions in terms of subjects\u2019 motives. Du Bois sketches a\nsimilar line of argument, five years later, in Dusk of Dawn\n(1940, 70).\n\nFor Du Bois, the function of the historian, \u201cposing\u201d as a\nscientist of human action, is \u201cto make clear the facts\u2026to\nknow, as far as possible\u2026the things that actually happened in\nthe world\u201d without regard to her personal desires and wishes\n(1935, 591). But the function of the philosopher and the prophet, he\nargues, is \u201cto interpret these facts\u201d \u2014that is, to\nconsider them in the perspective of our desire to guide mankind to\nundertake the social reforms needed to address social problems (1935,\n591).\n\nA prophet, a Jeremiah, for example, might well adduce facts of moral\nwrongdoing and guilt to alert his fellow citizens that their actions\nrisk God\u2019s wrath. And a philosopher, a philosopher of history,\nfor example, might adduce those facts in order to instruct them as to\nthe meaning, writ large, of the plot that the historian has\nchronicled\u2014precisely as Du Bois instructs his fellow citizens\nthat the story of slavery and reconstruction he has chronicled (in his\ncapacity as an historian) exhibits \u201cthe clear mistake and\nguilt\u201d that characterizes the \u201cplot\u201d of Aristotelian\ntragedy (1935, 585, 595). In both cases, the point would be the same:\nnamely, to use moral knowledge to warn one\u2019s fellow citizens of\nthe fateful consequences (God\u2019s wrath, tragedy) that await them\nlest they refuse to heed the lessons of the past and\nchange\u2014reform\u2014their ways.\n4. Political Philosophy\n\nDu Bois\u2019s political philosophy belongs to the Afro-modern\ntradition of political thought, an impressively rich body of non-ideal\npolitical theory that is bound together by certain thematic\npreoccupations\u2014e.g., the political and social organization of\nwhite supremacy, the nature and effects of racial ideology, and the\npossibilities of black emancipation\u2014 and that includes the\nwritings of Ottabah Cugoano, David Walker, Edward Blyden, Martin\nDelany, Frederick Douglass, and Alexander Crummell (Gooding-Williams,\n2009). Du Bois\u2019s most famous book, The Souls of Black\nFolk (1903a), is his earliest contribution to that tradition. Du\nBois\u2019s subsequent contributions to political philosophy and\npolitical theory appear in several different places and have been\nvariously taken up by contemporary\n scholars.[35]\n4.1 Early Du Bois: The Period of The Souls of Black Folk\n\nSouls is Du Bois\u2019s still influential answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhat kind of politics should African Americans\nconduct to counter white supremacy?\u201d Historically rooted in the\nsegregationist era of Jim Crow, Souls authority has reached\nwell beyond its origins, so much so that its compelling ideas and\narguments continue to be taken up by contemporary theorists of black\npolitics.\n4.1.1 Uplift and Political Expressivism\n\nIn Souls, Du Bois contends that a politics fit to respond to\nthe American, Jim Crow version of racial apartheid must satisfy two\nconditions. The first relates to Du Bois\u2019s description of\nAfrican Americans as \u201cmasses:\u201d to wit, to his\ncharacterization of African Americans as an aggregate of uncultured,\npre-modern slaves or former slaves. The second relates to his\ndescription of African Americans as a \u201cfolk:\u201d that is, to\nhis characterization of African Americans as a group united by a\ncollectively shared ethos, or spirit.\n\nFor Du Bois, a politics suitable to counter Jim Crow had to uplift the\nblack masses\u2014to assimilate them to the constitutive norms of\nmodernity\u2014and to heed the ethos of the black folk. In short, it\nhad to be a politics that embraced and promoted the core values of\nmodern life while expressing the spiritual identity of the folk. Du\nBois envisions black elites\u2014the so-called \u201ctalented\ntenth\u201d (1903b)\u2014as deploying a politics of expressive\nmodernization to uplift the black masses. Elite control of black\npolitics can be authoritative and effective, he argues, only if it\nexpresses a collective spirit that unites black people.\n\nThe young Du Bois\u2019s political philosophy rests on the social\nphilosophy he outlines in \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d and\n\u201cThe Study of Negro Problems.\u201d In arguing that talented\ntenth elites could enjoy political legitimacy and efficacy only if\ntheir actions expressed a distinctive message that spiritually\ndistinguished the Negro from other spiritually distinct races and that\nunited all African Americans, he presupposes his earlier answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is a Negro?\u201d In arguing that talented\ntenth elites needed to attack racial prejudice and cultural\nbackwardness alike in order to uplift and modernize the black masses,\nhe presupposes his earlier, causal analysis of Negro problems\n(Gooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 1).\n4.1.2 The Du Bois-Washington Debate\n\nDu Bois\u2019s extended critique of Booker T. Washington\u2019s\npolitical thought (see Souls, chapter 3) likewise presupposes\nhis earlier, causal analysis of Negro problems. Du Bois\u2019s\nargument immediately drew attention, for when Du Bois published\nSouls Washington had securely established himself \u201cas\nan educational statesman, the primary spokesman of black America, and\nthe leader of a large network of disciples\u2014the \u2018Tuskegee\nMachine\u2019\u2014who edited newspapers, owned businesses, and\ndirected schools modeled on Tuskegee\u201d(Blight and\nGooding-Williams, 1997, 16).\n\nWashington held that if blacks endeavored to help themselves\u2014to\ndiscipline their bodies, to cultivate entrepreneurial virtues (e.g.\nthrift, spirit of industry, and economy), and to acquire the knowledge\nof a trade\u2014they would thrive in the capitalist market and, due\nto their business success, bring an end to Jim Crow and win the\nfranchise. In short, he believed that black self-help efforts were\nsufficient to engender business success, and that business success was\nsufficient to persuade whites to extend to blacks the civil and\npolitical rights they required for incorporation into the mainstream\nof American society (Washington,\n 1901).[36]\n\nContra Washington, Du Bois argued that self-help efforts, while\nnecessary for black social progress, were not sufficient. Assuming\nthat both racial prejudice and cultural backwardness cause Negro\nproblems, Du Bois claims that a self-help politics that attends to the\nbackwardness of the Negro group itself without attacking racial\nprejudice is doomed to fail. Washington had argued that there was no\nneed to attack prejudice for the present, because self-help efforts\nthat contended with entrepreneurial-economic backwardness (for Du\nBois, a form of cultural backwardness) would suffice to defeat it. Du\nBois rejects this argument on the grounds that the persistent,\nprejudice-sustained denial of rights to blacks undermines their\nself-help efforts and prospects for business success.\nWashington\u2019s program amounts to a partial, one-sided attack on\nthe Negro problems. In Du Bois\u2019s view, black uplift and social\nprogress required that black political elites attack both prongs of\nthe Negro problem\u2014racial prejudice no less than backwardness. It\nalso required institutions of higher learning to train these elites.\nThus, Du Bois takes Washington to task for promoting an educational\nphilosophy that emphasized vocational education at the expense of\nhigher, liberal arts education (Du Bois, 1903a, chapter 3).\n4.1.3 Political Leadership and Double-Consciousness\n\nIn Souls, Du Bois sketches a biographical portrait of his\nmentor, Alexander Crummell, and a fictional portrait of a tragic hero,\nJohn Jones, to show how double-consciousness can compromise black\nelite political\n leadership.[37]\n Specifically, Du Bois represents double-consciousness as a form of\nalienation that estranges black elites from their followers, thereby\neroding their ability to promote ends expressing the collectively\nshared spirit of the black folk and undermining their legitimacy and\nefficacy as leaders (Du Bois, 1903a, chapters 1, 12\u201313;\nGooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 3).\n4.1.4 The Post-Jim Crow Inheritance of the Early Du Bois\n\nThe early Du Bois\u2019s defense of a black elite-led politics of\nexpressive modernization has exerted considerable influence on\npost-Jim Crow political philosophical appraisals of black American\npolitics. Indeed, it is all but impossible to grasp the point of those\nappraisals without taking account of their engagements, both explicit\nand implicit, with key elements of Du Bois\u2019s early political\nthought. For extended discussion of the issues central to the post-Jim\nCrow inheritance of Du Bois\u2019s early political thought, see,\nespecially, Reed, 1999 and Gooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 6.\n4.2 Du Bois\u2019s Political Thought After The Souls of Black Folk\n\nAs Lawrie Balfour has argued, Du Bois wrote \u201cprolifically\u201d\non a broad array of topics, so that his writings can usefully be read\nas an extended series of essayistic, experimental efforts to address\nthe various issues that engaged him (2011, 17\u201318). The reception\nof Du Bois by contemporary political theorists attests to the\nextraordinary, topical scope of his political thought, especially as\nit evolved after the publication of Souls.\n4.2.1 Du Bois\u2019s Elitism\n\nIn several post-Souls writings, Du Bois returns to the theme\nof black political leadership. In Dusk of Dawn, for example,\nhe reaffirms his belief that \u201cthe Talented Tenth\u201d should\ndetermine \u201cthe present field and demand for racial action and\nthe method by which the masses may be guided along this line\u201d\n(1940, 159). And several years later, after critically reflecting on\nhis earlier thinking about group leadership, he proposes a \u201cnew\nidea for a Talented Tenth\u201d (1948, 168). Whether or not Du Bois\nultimately rejected his earlier conception of elite black leadership\n(Du Bois, 1903b) is an issue of scholarly dispute. Joy James holds\nthat Du Bois eventually repudiates the idea of a black intelligentsia\nvanguard (James, 1997). Cornel West contends that Du Bois\u2019s\nlater revisions of his concept of the talented tenth were\n\u201cpiecemeal\u201d (West, 1996, 71). Adolph Reed, by way of a\nmeticulous reading of Du Bois\u2019s later writings and speeches,\nargues that Du Bois advanced an elite-centered notion of black\npolitics throughout his intellectual and activist career (Reed, 1997).\nTommie Shelby and Paul Taylor provide especially nuanced\nreconstructions of Du Bois\u2019s evolving understanding of black\npolitical leadership (Shelby, 2007, chapter 2; Taylor, 2010,\n907\u2013910.). More recently, Arash Davari has thoughtfully taken\nissue with both Reed and Gooding-Williams, arguing that, already in\nSouls and The Philadelphia Negro (1899), Du Bois\nestablishes the basis for non-elitist conception of democratic\npolitical leadership (Davari, 2018).\n4.2.2 Marx, Du Bois, and Black Radicalism\n\nAn important and still underappreciated strand of Du Bois\u2019s\npost-Souls political thought is his engagement with Marxist\nsocial and political theory. The key text here is Black\nReconstruction (1935), Du Bois\u2019s monumental critique of the\nDunning School\u2019s interpretation of\n Reconstruction.[38]\n Like Joel Olson (2004; see 2.2.4.3 above), Cedric Robinson (1983) and\nAnthony Bogues (2003) have argued that Black Reconstruction\nshould be read as historical and political theory, not simply as\nrevisionist historiography. On Robinson\u2019s reading, Du Bois\ndeveloped \u201ca theory of history, which by its emphasis on mass\naction was both a critique of the ideologies of American socialist\nmovements and a revision of Marx\u2019s theory of revolution and\nclass struggle\u201d (Robinson, 277). Bogues agrees that Du Bois\nbreaks with Marx and Marxist orthodoxy, and adds that, like other\nblack radical theorists, Du Bois reorients the radical critique of\nmodernity away from \u201cissues of political obligation, sovereign\nself and citizenship\u2026to questions of domination, oppression,\nand politics as a practice of freedom\u201d (Bogues, 93). Building on\nDu Bois and on Robinson\u2019s engagement with Du Bois, the\nhistorian, Walter Johnson (2016) has argued that the history of\nslavery and racial capitalism provides a standpoint from which\n\u201cto rethink our idea of justice\u201d (Johnson, 29). Although\nhe gives scant attention to Black Reconstruction in\npartiular, Charles Mills has made a strong case for categorizing Du\nBois as a \u201cblack radical liberal,\u201d where black radical\nliberalism \u201cis a liberalism informed by the realities of\nracial capitalism and self-consciously oriented accordingly\nby the need to rethink white liberal theory in the light\u201d\n(Mills, 2018, 32).\n\nThe most illuminating recent discussions of Black\nReconstruction\u2019s theoretical engagement with the Marxist\ntradition focus on particular chapters of Du Bois\u2019s magnum\nopus, including Gayatri Spivak\u2019s consideration of Du\nBois\u2019s idea of the general strike in connection to \u201cthe\nEuropean phenomenon of the general strike and its use by\nMarxism\u201d (Spivak, 2014, pp.9, 13; Du Bois, 1935, chapter 4);\nAllison Power\u2019s argument that Du Bois adapts Marx\u2019s\nnotions of transsubstantiation and commodity fetishism to analyze the\ntragedy of the life of Andrew Johnson as well as regressive\ninterpretations of the American Constitution as embodying eternal,\nimmutable law (Powers, 2014; Du Bois, 1935, chapters 8 and 9); and,\nfinally, Andrew Douglas\u2019s proposal that Du Bois develops a\npolitical theory of racial capitalism that prioritizes\npolitics over both economics and ethics (Douglas, 2019; Du Bois, 1935,\nchapters 7 and 14).\n4.2.3 Feminist Theory and Du Bois\n\nFeminist theorists\u2019 appraisals of Du Bois\u2019s political\nthought have been mixed, ranging from criticisms of his masculinist\nfailure to regard black women as intellectuals and race leaders (e.g.\nCarby, 1998 and James, 1997) to praise for his advocacy of\nwomen\u2019s equality and his contributions to our understanding of\nthe oppression of black women (e.g., James, 1997 and Griffin,\n2000).\n\nFeminist theorists\u2019 commentary on Du Bois\u2019s political\nthought has tended to concentrate on chapter 7 of Darkwater\n(1920), \u201cThe Damnation of Women.\u201d Women are damned, Du\nBois proposes, for \u201conly at the sacrifice of intelligence and\nthe chance to do their best work can the majority of women bear\nchildren\u201d (1920, 78\u201379). While Farah Griffin interprets\n\u201cDamnation\u201d in the perspective of a still persistent\n\u201cpolitics of protection\u201d that threatens the autonomy of\nblack women, arguing that Du Bois recognized the limits of that\npolitics (2000, 34\u201336), Lawrie Balfour reads the essay as\ncontributing to a \u201cfeminist theory of citizenship\u201d (2011,\n99\u2013100). Taking issue with Balfour, Shatema Threadcraft argues\nthat \u201cDamnation\u201d reprises and elaborates\nSouls\u2019 masculinist treatment of manliness as an\nappropriate norm of citizenship (2017, 92\u201394). Considering Du\nBois\u2019 depiction of black women in The Philadelphia\nNegro, as well as in \u201cThe Damnation of Women,\u201d\nSaidiya Hartman relies on free indirect discourse and critical\nfabulation to put into question the validity of the objectifying\nsociological perspective from which Du Bois characterizes young black\nwomen\u2019s lives (Hartman, 2019).\n\nConsidering Du Bois in light of black feminist and more general forms\nof contemporary intersectionality theory (which considers\nintersections between race, gender and class), Ange-Marie\nHancock examines Souls, Darkwater, and Dusk of\nDawn to identify insights in Du Bois\u2019s thinking that link\n\u201chis political theory with that of today\u2019s\nintersectionality theorists\u201d (2005, 82). It would be\nanachronistic to describe Du Bois as an intersectionality theorist,\nHancock admits, but she still claims that Du Bois anticipates recent\nintersectionality theory in arguing \u201cthat more than one category\nof difference should be attacked simultaneously, and, more\nimportantly, that the structures of society operate such that these\ncategories mutually reinforce social stratification for its least\nempowered inhabitants\u201d (2005, 79). \n4.2.4 Democratic Theory and Du Bois\n\nHow did Du Bois conceptualize democracy?\n\nDu Bois mentions democracy just once in Souls, where he\nstates that the \u201csoul of democracy and the safeguard of modern\nsociety\u201d is \u201c[h]onest and earnest criticism from those\nwhose interests are most nearly touched,\u2014criticism of writers by\nreaders, of government by those governed, of leaders by those\nled\u201d (1903a, 23). Du Bois defines democracy in terms of\ncriticism when he attacks Booker T. Washington for \u201chushing\ncriticism\u201d (1903a, 23). In exploring the implications of Du\nBois\u2019s statement for the picture of black politics he defends in\nSouls, Gooding-Williams raises a question as to whether elite\nleadership of backwards, black masses not competent to criticize their\nleaders could both satisfy Du Bois\u2019s definition of democracy and\nsuccessfully promote an uplift agenda (Gooding-Williams, 2009,\nchapters 1 and 4.) More recently, Nick Bromell has persuasively argued\nthat, throughout his career, Du Bois relies on the idea of\n\u201chonest and earnest criticism\u201d as a \u201cmodel of\ndemocratic reasoning,\u201d especially in addressing \u201can\nimagined polity of blacks and whites\u201d with the aim, Brommell\nargues, of reimagining and reconstructing American democracy (Bromell,\n2018, 160, 168).\n\nDu Bois\u2019s most thoroughgoing and sustained contributions to\ndemocratic theory can be found in \u201cThe African Roots of\nWar\u201d (1915), \u201cOf The Ruling of Men\u201d (chapter 6 of\nDarkwater), and Black Reconstruction. \n\nIn \u201cThe African Roots of War,\u201d Du Bois advances a theory\nof \u201cdemocratic despotism,\u201d which he presents as the\nsolution to a philosophical paradox. \u201cMost philosophers,\u201d\nhe writes, \u201csee the ship of state launched on the broad,\nirresistible tide of democracy, with only delaying eddies here and\nthere.\u201d \u201cOthers,\u201d however, \u201clooking closer,\nare more disturbed. Are we, they ask, reverting to aristocracy and\ndespotism \u2013 the rule of might?\u201d The paradox is not simply\nconceptual, but readily observable in the world, for it has\n\u201creconciled the Imperialists and captains of industry to any\namount of \u2018Democracy\u2019,\u201d while allowing \u201cin\nAmerica the most rapid advance of democracy to go hand in\nhand\u2026with increased aristocracy and hatred toward darker\nraces.\u201d Du Bois\u2019s solution is straightforward: \u201cThe\nparadox is easily explained,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe white\nworkingman has been asked to share the spoil of exploiting\n\u2018chinks and niggers.\u2019\u201d For Du Bois, the paradox of\nmodern democracy is explained by the circumstance that democratic\nprogress within Europe and America for white laborers has entailed the\ndespotic exploitation in America and elsewhere of \u201cchinks\u2019\nand \u2018niggers\u2019\u201d (Du Bois, 1915, pp.....)\n\nDu Bois\u2019s theory of democratic despotism is a theory of\ndemocracy as it actually exists in Europe and the United\nStates--more exactly, of western democracies\u2019s entanglement with\nempire. Scholars of Du Bois\u2019s \u201cinternational\nthought\u201d have given particular attention to his theory of\ndemocratic despotism, arguing that it marks an important shift in his\nthinking. According to Ines Valdez, for example, the theory of\ndemocratic despotism completes Du Bois\u2019s move away from a\n\u201ccivilizationist\u201d and \u201cdevelopmentalist\u201d\nunderstanding of the international order, thus initiating his\narticulation of a \u201ctransnational cosmopolitanism\u201d that\nrevises Kantian as well as recent neo-Kantian accounts of cosmopoitan\nhospitality. (Valdez, 2019, chapter 3). According to Adom Getchew and\nJennifer Pitts, Du Bois\u2019s theory transforms his account of the\nglobal color line making clear that western imperialism was a\n\u201ccolaborative and shared Euro-American enterprise\u201d and\nthat practices of subordinated inclusion, as well as racialized\nexclusion, helped to secure the stability of empire (Getachew and\nPitts, 2022, xx-xxxi).\n\nIn \u201cOf the Ruling of Men\u201d, Du Bois defends the ideal\nof universal suffrage. In addition, he engages familiar,\nTocquevillian worries about the tyranny of the majority; envisions\ndemocratic decision making in deliberative democratic terms; and\ndefends not only a broadly inclusive form of political democracy, but\nthe idea that modern industry should be subject to democratic decision\nmaking\u2014in essence, the idea of democratic socialism. Du\nBois\u2019s argument for inclusiveness, for extending the right of\ndemocratic participation to women and blacks, for example, is\nessentially epistemic: \u201conly the sufferer knows his\nsuffering and\u2026no state can be strong which excludes from its\nexpressed wisdom the knowledge possessed by mothers, wives, and\ndaughters\u2026The same arguments apply to other excluded\ngroups\u201d (1920, 69; for detailed discussion of Du Bois\u2019s\nepistemic defense of democracy, see, also, Bright, 2017, 14\u201315,\nDarby, 2020, and Gooding-Williams, 2023). For a consideration of Du\nBois\u2019s essay in the perspective of Classical political thought,\nsee Fertik (2019).\n\nIn Black Reconstruction, no less than in \u201cOf the Ruling\nof Men,\u201d Du Bois characterizes democracy in economic as well as\npolitical terms; that is, as the legitimate transfer of political and\neconomic power from the ruling classes to the working masses. Cornel\nWest interprets Black Reconstruction as promoting a Deweyan\nnotion of creative democracy (West, 1988). Gooding-Williams (1991)\ndisputes that interpretation, arguing that it obscures the\nconnotations of class struggle that attach to Du Bois\u2019s account\nof black workers\u2019 efforts to reconstruct democracy. In Color\nand Democracy (1946), which Du Bois published just a little more\nthan a decade after Black Reconstruction, he writes that\n\u201c[m]ore important than political democracy is industrial\ndemocracy; that is, the voice which the actual worker, whether his\nwork be manual or mental, has in the organization and conduct of\nindustry\u201d (1946,\n 300).[39]\n\nFor the purposes of democratic theory, Black\nReconstruction\u2019s most important idea is the idea of\nabolition democracy. For Du Bois, \u2018abolition democracy\u2019\nnames both a political movement and the ideal that the movement failed\nto realize. Du Bois argues that realizing the ideal of abolition\ndemocracy required more than the satisfaction of the moral demand to\nemancipate the slaves, but, in Angela Davis\u2019s words, the\nestablishment of \u201cnew institutions\u201d\u2014specifically,\ninstitutions that provided the former slaves with the the economic,\npolitical, and educations means that were needed fully to\n\u201cincorporate black people into the social order.\u201d Drawing\non Hegel\u2019s concept of objective spirit, especially as he\ndevelops it in The Philosophy of Right, Elvira Basevich\nsimilarly argues that Du Bois saw the freedman and their allies as\nadvancing a conception of democracy that called for the transformation\nof American Sittlichkeit (Ethical Life) through the\n\u201creconstitution of the black family, civil society, and the\nfederal state\u201d (see Du Bois, 98, 151, 169; Davis, 2005,\n95\u201396; and Basevich, 2021, chapter 5).\n\nThe ongoing importance of Du Bois\u2019s contributions to democratic\ntheory has been well established by the recent work of Lawrie Balfour\nand Tommie Shelby.\n\nIn her essays on Darkwater, Dusk of Dawn, and other writings,\nfor example, Balfour subtly brings Du Bois\u2019s political thought\ninto conversation with the work of contemporary political theorists.\nTo reorient democratic theory in dark times, Balfour argues, we would\ndo well to think politically with Du Bois. To that end, she examines\nthe political-theoretical ramifications of Du Bois\u2019s literary\nchoices; his use of history to highlight the implication of\nAmerica\u2019s slave past in its post-Civil Rights present; his\ndepiction of African American lives as exemplary representatives of\ndemocratic possibility; and his globally expansive political\nimagination, which, Balfour argues, reveals the racial politics of\nrecent defenses of cosmopolitanism and civic nationalism (Balfour,\n2010,\n 2011).[40]\n\nIn Shelby\u2019s view, Du Bois took African-Americans to be the\nbearers of a world-historical mission to perfect the ideals of\nAmerican democracy. Du Bois endorsed black political solidarity,\nShelby argues, as a temporary and, possibly, long-term strategy for\nestablishing a multiracial, culturally pluralist American polity that\nembodied those ideals. Shelby follows Du Bois in maintaining that\nblack political solidarity in the pursuit of a racial justice that is\nconsonant with American democratic and liberal ideals requires a\nmotivational foundation that unites self-interest, moral principle,\nand racial identification (Shelby, 2007, 6\u20137, 67, 87).\n4.2.5 Freud, Du Bois, and the Long Siege\n\nIn chapter 1 of Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois describes his thought\nregarding the causes of the oppression of the darker races as evolving\nthrough three stages\u2014roughly, from thinking that racial\noppression was caused by ignorance; to thinking that it was caused by\nignorance and ill-will; to thinking that it was caused by\nignorance and ill-will and a conjunction of economic\nmotives and unconscious, irrational acts and reactions. Corresponding\nto each stage, Du Bois tells us, was an increasingly complex account\nof the political strategies the darker races require to upend racial\noppression. Where ignorance is the problem, science and education is\nneeded to fight racial injustice; where ill-will is the issue, the\nblack world must fight for its freedom, relying on truth, boycott,\npropaganda and mob frenzy as instruments of sudden and immediate\nassault. Where, finally, economic interest and/or unconscious,\nirrational motive sustain racial oppression, \u201cnot sudden assault\nbut long siege was indicated; careful planning and subtle campaign\nwith the education of growing generations and propaganda\u201d (1940,\n2\u20133).\n\nPrior to 1940, some consideration of each of these causes of\noppression and related strategies of resistance is evident in Du\nBois\u2019s writings. Still, Dusk of Dawn is remarkable for\nthe prominence it gives to the role of unconscious and irrational\npsychological forces in accounting for the existence and perpetuation\nof racial oppression. Du Bois attributes this new emphasis to the\n\u201cnew psychology\u201d of the \u201cFreudian era.\u201d His\n\u201cstudy of psychology under William James\u201d had prepared him\nfor the Freudian turn, he remarks, and its \u201cmeaning and\nimplications\u2026had begun slowly to penetrate his thought\u201d\n(1940, 148).\n\nContemporary political theorists have, for the most part, tended to\nignore Du Bois\u2019s Freud-inspired account of racial oppression. An\nexception is Shannon Sullivan, for whom Du Bois suggests \u201ca\npowerful psychoanalytic-pragmatist model for surveying the unconscious\noperations of white domination\u201d (Sullivan, 2006, 23). A second\nexception is Ella Myers, who has begun to build on Du Bois\u2019s\narguments to reflect on the visceral and affective registers of\nantiblack racism (Myers,\n 2017).[41]\n Robert Gooding-Williams (2011) has adapted Du Bois\u2019s idea of a\n\u201clong siege\u201d against racial oppression\u2014against what\nDu Bois also calls \u201cthe strongholds of color\ncaste\u201d\u2014to a critical analysis of some recent discussions\nof racial politics (1940, 148).\n5. Philosophy of Art\n\nPaul Taylor has persuasively sketched a general framework for\nunderstanding Du Bois\u2019s philosophy of art. According to Taylor,\nDu Bois endorses an expressivist picture of the world, the key to\nwhich \u201cis a determination to think of things as determinate but\nprovisional expressions of an evolving world.\u201d On this view,\n\u201cthe world unfolds into new forms the way a seed unfolds into a\ntree\u2026by clarifying, over time, what was inchoate and implicit:\nby actualizing in history what formerly existed only in\npotentia.\u201d Considered in the perspective of Marx\u2019s\nand Dewey\u2019s revisions of Hegel\u2019s expressivism,\nTaylor\u2019s Du Bois envisions ethical life as a\nwork-in-progress\u2014that is, as an ongoing project of holistic\nself-cultivation, of individuals artistically forming themselves by\ncreatively responding to the histories, languages, and economic\nstructures that constrain them (Taylor, 2016, 91\u201393).\n5.1 High Art and Low Art\n\nDu Bois\u2019s articulation of his commitment to the ideal of\nholistic self-cultivation is perhaps most explicit when, in amplifying\nhis criticism of Booker T. Washington, he defends the importance of\nliberal arts education (Gooding-Williams, 2009, 133\u2013139).\nExplicitly echoing Matthew Arnold, Du Bois advocated liberal arts\neducation as a means to self-cultivation or, as he sometimes writes,\nself-development, through \u201cgetting to know\u2026the best that\nhas been said and thought in the world\u201d (Arnold, 1869, 5).\nSelf-development through the acquisition of culture is the purpose of\nthe education elites require to uplift the masses. The Negro college,\nDu Bois writes, \u201cmust develop men\u2026Above our modern\nsocialism, and out of the worship of the mass, must persist that\nhigher individualism which centres of culture protect; there must come\na loftier respect for the sovereign human souls that seeks to know\nitself and the world about it; that seeks a freedom for expansion and\nself-development\u201d (1903a, 52).\n\nFor the Du Bois of Souls, the art that sovereign souls\nappreciate is high art\u2014or, in other words, art that shares with\nthe sovereign souls that appreciate it the property of holistic\nself-development. In \u201cThe Sorrow Songs,\u201d the final chapter\nof Souls, Du Bois represents the group spirit that unites\nblack Americans as clarifying its distinctive message through the\nmedium of the folk song. Considered in historical perspective, the\nmusically embodied spirit of the black folk, as it actualizes itself\nthrough time, in folk song after folk song, acquires a spiritually\ncomprehensive breadth that overcomes racial prejudice and\nprovincialism. To these songs, which manifest a developing folk spirit\nand that constitute an evolving tradition of black musical art, Du\nBois contrasts a \u201cmass\u201d of spiritually inert minstrel\nsongs, gospel hymns and coon songs (1903a, 124). In essence, he argues\nthat, no less than Wagner\u2019s operas, which he admired, the\nspiritually-inspired black folk song belongs to the canon of high art\nfrom which the low arts of the minstrel song and the like are\nexcluded.\n\nOn this view, Du Bois\u2019s early political expressivism is of a\npiece with his broadly expressivist philosophy of art, for it asserts\nthat, to be legitimate and effective, black political leaders must\ntake their bearing not from the uninspired mass of popular song that\nthe masses might enjoy, but from the spirit and spiritual message\nembodied in the black folk song (Gooding-Williams, 2009,\n139\u2013147).\n5.2 Art, Beauty, and Propaganda\n\nDu Bois\u2019s essay, \u201cCriteria of Negro Art\u201d (1925), is\nhis most important contribution to the philosophy of art. The essay is\nDu Bois\u2019s clearest statement of his disagreement with the\nphilosopher and Dean of the Harlem Renaissance, Alain Locke, about the\nrelation between art and propaganda. Against Locke\u2019s view that\ngenius and talent \u201cmust choose art and put aside\npropaganda,\u201d Du Bois held \u201cthat all art is propaganda and\never must be\u201d (Locke, 1928, par. 1; Du Bois, 1926, par. 29). At\nissue in Du Bois\u2019s \u201cgreat debate\u201d with Locke is the\nrole of the arts \u201cin creating respect for a people suffering\nfrom humiliation and self-loathing\u201d (Harris, 15).\n\nDu Bois claims that artists rely on beauty to communicate truth and\ngoodness (in all its aspects of justice, honor, and right)\u2014in\nthe first case to promote universal understanding, and in the second\nto gain sympathy and human interest. The \u201capostle of\nBeauty,\u201d he writes, \u201cthus becomes the apostle of truth and\nright not by choice but by inner and outer compulsion. Free he is, but\nhis freedom is ever bounded by Truth and Justice\u201d (par. 28).\n\nConsidering these claims in the perspective of Du Bois\u2019s\nexpressivism, Taylor plausibly interprets Du Bois as arguing that,\nbecause artists \u201care dialectically enmeshed in wider webs of\nmeaning concerning the true and the just, and must create themselves\nas individuals by working out their orientation to these\nnetworks,\u201d all art is propaganda. On this account, no work of\nart can reasonably claim to derive its content from \u201ca distinct\nand inviolate domain of aesthetic value,\u201d for all art derives\nits content from a public domain of ethico-political value to which\nthe artist must creatively respond. The artist is at once outwardly\nand inwardly compelled by the webs of meaning that encumber her, for\nwhile these webs of meaning impose themselves from\n\u201cwithout,\u201d the artist suffers them as parameters\nconstituting her \u201cwithin\u201d as a subject. The freedom that\nthe apostle of truth and right can claim in relation to these\nparameters is akin to self-legislation\u2014it is the freedom she\nenjoys in creatively responding to them, in working out her\nrelationship to them and, in effect, making them her own (Taylor,\n2016, 96\u201399).\n\nBy exercising her freedom, finally, by creating beautiful works of art\nthat promote the ends of sympathy and universal understanding, the\nartist may undertake to widen the ethical and cognitive horizons of\nher intended addressees, and thus to expand their capacity for\njudgment. In writing a book like Souls, for example, Du Bois\nundertook to widen his white counterparts\u2019 capacities to\nsympathize with and evaluate the suffering in the souls of black\nAmericans (Rogers, 2012, 193\u2013198).\n\nWhat is the nature of beauty such that it can achieve these ends\nthrough the communication of truth and goodness? Du Bois never states\na clear answer to this\n question.[42]\n But he offers clues to an answer in \u201cOf Beauty and\nDeath,\u201d chapter 9 of Darkwater. In that essay, his most\nsustained reflection on the nature of beauty, Du Bois contrasts beauty\nto \u201cugliness and hate and ill\u2026with all their\ncontradiction and illogic;\u201d beauty, he writes, \u201cis\nfulfillment. It satisfies. It is always new and strange. It is the\nreasonable thing\u201d (1920, 120). Perhaps Du Bois\u2019s point is\nan expressivist one: that beauty satisfies by clarifying our ideas of\ntruth (at once consistent and reasonable) and goodness (the opposite\nof hate and ill); that is, by embodying those ideas in novel and\nunsettling works of art (for further reflection on Du Bois\u2019s\naesthetics, see Valdez, 2019, chapter 3 and Gooding-Williams, 2021 and\n2023).\n6. Intellectual History, History of Philosophy, and Du Bois\n\nWe conclude this entry by noting that an ongoing feature of scholarly\ndebate about Du Bois is sometimes contentious disagreement as to his\nproper place in intellectual history and/or the history of philosophy.\nA brief survey of the variety of interpretive orientations that\nusefully have been brought to bear in appraising Du Bois as a\nphilosopher, or as a thinker, suggests that, in studying his writings,\nwe might do well to heed Nietzsche\u2019s suggestion that the\nmultiplication of perspectives can often enhance our knowledge of the\nsubject matter under consideration (Nietzsche, 1887, 85).\n\nThe relevant categories tend to be geographic, racial, thematic, or\nsome combination of the three. Du Bois\u2019s philosophical books and\nessays have been read as contributions to American thought (Zamir,\n1995) and to American political thought (Reed, 1997). More narrowly\nand more broadly, they have been read as statements of\nAfro-American exceptionalist thought (West, 1982); as key constituents\nof the black nationalist tradition (Moses, 1978); as important\nadditions to the black natural law tradition (Lloyd, 2016); as a part\nof the history of African American prophetic political critique\n(Marshall, 2011); and as critical contributions to Africana and\nAfro-Modern thought (Gordon, 2008; Gooding-Williams, 2009). Intending\nto correct the tendency evident in these works to position Du Bois as\nan American, black American, Africana, and/or Afro-modern thinker,\nAppiah (2014) has highlighted the late 19th century, German\nintellectual milieu that shaped Du Bois\u2019s thinking. Contra\nAppiah, Tommy Curry (2014) has argued that we lose sight of the\nphilosophical substance of Du Bois\u2019s thought if, like Appiah, we\nscant the influence of other African American writers on his\nthinking.\n\nAmong critics wishing to situate Du Bois within a well-defined,\nwestern philosophical tradition, the main tendencies have been to\ncharacterize Du Bois either as a pragmatist (see West, 1989, Taylor,\n2004b, and Kahn, 2009) or as an Hegelian of sorts. Much of the\nliterature following this second line of interpretation has considered\nDu Bois\u2019s writings, and especially Souls, in the\nperspective of Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit (see,\ne.g., Gooding-Williams, 1987 and 1991; Zamir, 1995; and, most\nrecently, Shaw, 2013). In this connection, Paul Taylor (2004b) has\npersuasively argued that we need not choose between an Hegelian Du\nBois and a pragmatist Du Bois. More recently, Nahum Chandler has\nproposed to read Du Bois neither as an Hegelian, nor as a pragmatist,\nbut in parallel to several of his European contemporaries, including\nHusserl, Weber, Durkheim, Boas and Freud (Chandler, 2014).\n\nTo be sure, it would be false to claim that all of the above-mentioned\ninterpretive perspectives have yielded genuine insight and\nillumination. But more have than have not, a fact that primarily\nattests to the range, depth, and fecundity of Du Bois\u2019s\nphilosophical thought.\n",
