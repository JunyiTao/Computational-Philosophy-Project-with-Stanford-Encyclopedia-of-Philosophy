Systematic Cosmology: \u201cAll Things in the Universe Interactively Connect\u201d\nWhen Kant returned to K\u00f6nigsberg in early autumn 1754, his\nprospects had improved. King Friedrich II (Frederick the Great, reign\n1740\u201386), like Kant a victim of a fundamentalist education, had\ninstituted liberal policies in Prussia that were making themselves\nfelt in the province. Kant\u2019s former advisor Knutzen had died (1751),\nand a freer atmosphere now pervaded the university. Kant had saved\nsome money, supplemented his formal education with his own studies,\nand was prepared to return to school. He would now complete his\nstudies and start his academic career.\nHe dedicated the Universal Natural History to Frederick\nthe Great and published it in spring 1755. With this publication, Kant\ncautiously published anonymously. The problem was not risking\nreligious opposition by endorsing Newton. Rather, it was that Kant had\nsharpened celestial mechanics to a secular and dynamic cosmology,\nwhile replacing Newton\u2019s Christian view of natural design with a\nnon-anthropocentric and naturalistic teleology. He supported Newtonian\nmechanics and cosmology, but to the detriment of biblical creation\nstories.\nNewton had thought that cosmic organization required the hand of\nGod, but Kant eliminated any need for divine interference. Newton had\nsupposed that God regularly infuses nature with new motion to keep\nthe world machine from running down due to entropy; he had accepted\nthe notion of final causes as ways in which God makes himself known;\nand he had appealed to God\u2019s miraculous adjustments whenever physical\nexplanations failed him, as in the case of the ecliptic\nplane.[19]\nNewton could not explain the coplanar orbits of planets and surmised,\n\u201csuch a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be\nallowed the effect of choice\u201d (1979 [1730]: 402).\nKant discovered in the Universal Natural History that the\nplanetary arrangement on the ecliptic plane results from forces acting\non particles that accrete in a spinning cloud. Hence there was no need\nto follow Newton and appeal to God. Nor was there any compelling\nmetaphysical reason to do so. Force is goal-directed and its energy\nunfolds the cosmos. The term Kant employs for this\nunfolding, Auswicklung der Natur (1:226.8), is the\n\u201cout-wrapping\u201d of nature, from primal force to complex\nstructure. \u201cOut-wrapping\u201d is both process and purpose.\nPurpose is not imposed by a supernatural God, but, instead, woven into\nthe natural fabric. Teleological ends and means are natural in the\ndevelopment of forces, location, space and particles; the interplay of\nforces is the vehicle of final causes, and the telos of\nnature is its own fulfillment. (1:223, 263, 332). Even in its simplest\nstate, matter has the urge to develop itself. (1:228, 262\u20133,\n314). The rise of order and abundance\u2014or biological diversity,\nin our terms\u2014marks nature\u2019s quest toward fulfillment, and this\nprocess, fueled by the incessant pulse of attraction and repulsion,\ngenerates harmony and beauty.\nFollowing this cosmic model, in which Kant rejects extrinsic\nteleology for an immanent version, everything is connected. Taking\nhis cue from Pope\u2019s \u201cchain of being\u201d, Kant likens the\nuniverse to a Kette der Natur, the \u201cchain of\nnature\u201d (1: 308, \n365).[20]\n Humans are merely links in the greater\nchain of being. Dismissing the anthropocentric teleology of Wolff,\nDerham, and the physico-theologians, Kant finds the claim that the\nuniverse was created for human purposes exaggerated\u2014and\nprovincial.[21]\nAn intelligent louse, he says, might as well imagine that the scalp\nit lives on and the forest of hair that surrounds it were created\njust for the sake of its happiness; from a louse\u2019s point of view,\nthings surely look that way (1:353\u20134). In the chain of nature,\nall beings are equal. Nature does not play favorites, none of the\norganic links, whether it be an insect or a rational being, is more\nimportant than another (1:354). As the goal of force is complexity,\nthe goal of nature (commonly understood) is biodiversity, the goal of\nplanets is to sustain biospheres, the goal of terrestrial existence\nis to increase biota\u2014the telos of nature is life\n(1:353), at least until it reaches maximum density and begins to\nfracture in cosmic collapse.\nWhat kind of life? Ultimately, Kant argues, planets aim to sustain\nintelligent life. Inspired by Fontenelle\u2019s vision of inhabited\nworlds, he conjectures that there may well be extraterrestrial\nlife.[22]\nNothing, however, guarantees that humans are the crowns of creation\nnor even atop the chain of being. Humans, Kant conjectures, occupy a\n\u201cmiddle rung\u201d on the ladder of creatures\n(1:359.29)\u2014and are possibly infinitely distant from the top\ntier of intelligent beings (1:353.35\u20136). A sober look at\nourselves shows that we are on a risky course (gef\u00e4hrliche\nMittelstrasse, 1:366.7) halfway between wisdom and\nirrationality. We are cosmically mediocre.\nA theme of Kant\u2019s thought, dominant in the pre-critical period,\nintegral to the critical period, and to which he returns in old age,\nis that humans are part of nature. He was too familiar with the\nphilosophy of Descartes and its problems to subscribe to a mind-body\ndualism of distinct substances, the one thinking, the other\nextended. Instead he followed Bilfinger\u2019s heuristic, and already in\nthe Living Forces he had solved Descartes\u2019s puzzle of\nmind-body interaction by arguing that minds are spatially located\nwithin their bodies, and that both are energetic structures that\ninfluence each other (1:20\u201321). In the later Prize\nEssay (1764), he would judge the Christian notion of immaterial\nsouls as indemonstrable (2:293), an argument he re-echoes in his\ncritical writings as well (A339/B397\u2013A405/B432). Although minds\nare not necessarily matter in a literal sense, he would argue there\nthat they are probably some kind of energy-bundles commensurate with\nthe material framework of nature. Here in the Universal Natural\nHistory, he describes humans as material beings; the makeup of\nrationality is linked to the constitution of matter as a product of\ndynamic force (1:335).\nAll things interactively connect, and as minds shape matter, matter\nshapes minds. Coarse matter makes mental fibers inflexible\n(1:356). The IQ-constraining coarseness is proportional to density. In\ncosmic terms, this means that rational force depends on spatial\nlocation. In the stellar nebula (the embryonic solar system), matter,\nconsisting of elements with varying density, was randomly\ndistributed. But as soon as an interactive forces pulls the material\ncloud in and sets it spinning, denser particles will not be as easily\npushed around as lighter ones; when unequal bits collide, lighter ones\nbounce off while denser ones remain on track. Denser elements,\ndeflected later, cruise on lower orbits; lighter elements, deflected\nsooner, orbit higher up. Orbital height is inversely proportional to\nmaterial density (1:270); hence orbital bands form denser planets the\ncloser they are to the Sun (1:277; Kant\u2019s \u201cstatic\nlaw\u201d). Kant speculates that really superior intelligence will\nonly emerge in the rarefied matter of outer planets (1:359). The\ndenser a planet is (as Earth, close to the Sun) the denser,\nunfortunately, are its inhabitants.\nThe anonymous publication of the Universal Natural History\nwas prudent but not without risk. The dedication indicates K\u00f6nigsberg\nas place of composition; the publisher Petersen was a local company,\nand eventually the identity of the author would have come\nout.[23]\nPetersen went bankrupt just when copies of the Universal Natural\nHistory were off the press and in a warehouse. The warehouse was\nsealed\u2014and then mysteriously burned down, which allowed\nPetersen to collect insurance and pay off creditors. Bankruptcy and\nfire prevented the book\u2019s distribution (Rahts 1902: 545\u20136;\nKrafft 1971: 193). But this was not necessarily a bad turn for\nKant. As the fates of Spinoza, Tschirnhaus, or Toland illustrate, you\ncannot be a dynamic freethinker and a professor in the conservative\nuniversity system at the same time.  Considering Kant\u2019s goals, the\nmisfortune over the book was a blessing in disguise.\nUndaunted, he set out to write his Master\u2019s thesis. According to\nthe ideas articulated so far, Kant envisioned a radiating essence\nthat organizes itself in cosmic expansion. The core stretches out as\ninteractive complexity, emerging in biospheres populated by\norganisms, while eventually pulling back into itself, like a phoenix\nof nature, burning up only to rise from the ashes. The cyclic\n\u201cout-wrapping of nature\u201d generates structures, some of\nthem animated, a few of them intelligent. By their harmonic\ndevelopment, the natural structures will eventually allocate force\nwithout lateral boundaries, setting the cosmic vector free. When this\nis a universal condition, the energy flow is uniform in reiterative\npatterns across magnitudes. It is then entropic. Overcoming the last\nboundary, the vertical order of magnitudes, force rushes into itself,\nconcentrating its pulse once more to a singularity before the next\ncosmic upsurge.[24]\nIn order to understand the dynamics of force at the inception of\ncosmoi, the pulse of the bond, flaring out structure, may be\nvisualized as fire. Fire is an exemplar of the interplay of forces. It\nis no surprise that the author of Living Forces\nand Universal Natural History would want to investigate it,\nfor doing so might lead to more insights about the cosmic matrix. He\nchose Johann Gottfried Teske (1704\u201372), a professor of physics\ninterested in electricity and lightning, as his advisor and graduated\nwith A Succinct Outline of Some Meditations on Fire.\nHence Kant, who would later soar to the heights of\nthe Critiques and the Categorical Imperative, earned his\nphilosophy degree with a Master\u2019s thesis on the structure of fire\n(1755).\nOn Fire is an elaboration of the energetic model of\nmatter.  Kant argues there that all bodies, solid, liquid, and gaseous\ntypes, consist of dynamic particles or molecules (moleculae,\n1:372.24 and passim). He contends that the particles cohere in an\nelastic medium. This medium, the ether, permeates the molecular\ninterstices of bodies (prop. 3, 1: 372). He calls this ether\n\u201cfire-matter\u201d and identifies it as the carrier of warmth\nand light. Heat results from wave-like vibrations of this materia\nignis among the molecules (prop. 8, 1:377). As it is known today,\nheat is a symptom of molecular vibration, which in turn depends on the\nenergy-state of a body.\nAfter being awarded with Master\u2019s degree, Kant wrote his\ndissertation, the New Elucidation of the First Principles of\nMetaphysical Cognition (1755). At first glance, this work has\nlittle to do with his previous research on force, cosmos, and fire. It\nis about the principles of ontology, specifically the conceptual tools\nfor metaphysical investigations. In fact, however, it was only a\nmatter of time until he would write such a work. Now he would explore\nthe cognitive access to dynamic interactivity and the causal structure\nof human integration into nature. Quite naturally, Kant moved from\ncosmic origins to nebulae to solar systems to planets and biota, and\nthen to rational life. With his doctoral dissertation, Kant hoped to\nget to the bottom of the things that interested him most.\nCommonsensically understood, humans are parts of nature. Their\nactions are free, yet natural processes are mechanical and\npredictable.  One pressing question then becomes: How do human actions\nand natural processes relate? If nature is the out-wrapping of force,\nand intelligent beings are products of the cosmos, how is their free\naction possible in a lawful natural matrix? In the New\nElucidation, Kant argues for a compatibilist view\u2014both\nhuman freedom and natural necessity are real, and neither is reducible\nto the other. As Kant\u2019s thematic continued to develop, their seeming\nconflict finds a dynamic resolution. Everything in nature happens for\na prior reason (1:396.8\u20139), and this rule applies to both\nnecessary events and free actions. Both process-types share the fact\nof causal connectivity, but they connect to causes in different ways\n(1:400.30\u20137). Causation types concern the degree of power by\nwhich they are influenced, and this is what distinguishes between the\ntwo. The opposites, free acts and mechanical events harmonize over\nforce. A free will is not something being pushed around, but is\ninstead a \u201cdetermining power\u201d (determinandi\npotestas; 1:404.8). By its power, a will can withstand impulses\n(motivi) without being always forced by them\n(1:404.10\u201314, 34\u20139).  Those events that do not have\nsufficient power to withstand force are seen as natural and necessary\nconsequents, those events that possess sufficient ability to withstand\nforces are seen as free acts. Thus freedom/ spontaneity is naturally\npossible.\nLater, in the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals\n(1785), Kant would distinguish between \u201cthings\u201d and\n\u201cpersons\u201d (4:428), describing the former as natural means\nand the latter as rational ends. Persons are free; what distinguishes\nthem is their will, a faculty of determining oneself to action\n(4:427).  Self-determination is the basis of freedom; necessitation is\nthe mark of nature. The New Elucidation supplies the unified\nground for this dichotomy. Autonomy and heteronomy are a matter of\ndynamic degree.  Persons and things alike are energetic bundles of\ncollocated forces, but the superior rational force of persons can\nresist others and is capable of autonomy.\nAs the title of the New Elucidation of the Principles of\nMetaphysical Cognition indicates, it is a new attempt to clarify\nthe cognitive principles needed for understanding the structure of\nreality. The force-space bond in Kant\u2019s first book, as well as the\nattractive-repulsive interplay in his second, reveal that dynamic\ninteractivity is the generative matrix of nature. Interaction is not\n\u201cone\u201d thing but involves at least two poles that engage\nwith one another. Because the dynamic\n\u201cbetween\u201d\u2014their link\u2014is fundamental, the\ncognitive tool for capturing the ultimate reality cannot be\n\u201cone\u201d principle. It cannot even be a basic principle of\nidentity (a = a). Interaction is a relation of distinct\nitems that grip one another\u2014if they were not distinct, the event\nwould be an action, not interaction. But it is dynamic interactivity\nthat is the thing in itself.\nHence the New Elucidation does not begin with the\nprinciple of identity, like other ontological templates. Kant states\nthat \u201cthere is no unique, absolutely first, universal principle\nof all truths\u201d (prop. 1, 1:388.11\u201312). Instead, the\nidentity-pair of opposites is absolutely primary (absolute\nprima): \u201cwhatever is, is, and whatever is not, is\nnot\u201d (prop. 2, 1:389.3\u20136). Affirmative and negative\nidentity, when juxtaposed, suggest contradiction. This means that\ncontradiction is a derivative of the primary\nidentity-pair.[25]\n It also means that contradiction is\ngoverned by a prior (prae) identity (prop. 3,\n1:390.30\u20132). Just consider any real knowledge: truth rests on\nan intuition of its ground (intuiti niti, 1:394.3\u20134),\nand if one wants to go beyond tautological transformations, ground of\ntruth will differ from truth grounded.  Analogously, actual states of\naffairs are grounded in other events (prop. 6,\n1:394.10\u201311). Hence distinct antecedent reasons determine\ntruths; distinct prior grounds determine things. At the same time,\nthe truths determined give meaning to the antecedent as their reason,\nand the things determined give context to the prior as their\nground. Reality emerges as soon as the dynamic center patterns\nalterity, while being placed and defined by the patterned alterity\nwhen doing so. The resulting interaction is essential. And it is\naccessible.  Metaphysical cognition begins with communal identity\n(communiter principium identitatis) governing contradiction\n(prop. 2, 1:389.3\u20136).\nAs the communal identity of opposites is the universal grounded,\nthe ultimate ground must be identity as such. Now the simple unit\nappears.  It is outside our grasp but absolutely necessary (prop. 7,\n1:395.4\u20136). The necessary existing unit is called\n\u201cGod\u201d (ibid.). From it everything follows (prop. 8,\n1:396.8\u20139). Specifically, what follows, and now once more within\ncognitive reach, is change (mutatio, 1:410.18). Kant\u2019s\nPrinciple of Succession makes change intelligible: change occurs\nbecause of substantial connections ([substantiae] cum\naliis connexae sunt); the mutual dependency of substances\ndetermines mutual alterations (prop. 12, 1:411.18\u2013200). A bond\ngoverns change and thus reality. This dynamic-structural bond is a\nreciprocal, harmonious dependency. Metaphysical cognition ends with\nreciprocal commercium or interactivity, Kant\u2019s Principle of\nCoexistence (prop. 13, 1:412\u201313).\nThat such a dynamic harmony can exist is so amazing that it has to\nbe divinely sustained (1:413.10\u201315). Thus the New\nElucidation ends with the marvel over interaction. He writes:\n\n\u2026 Since we find all things in the universe to be\ninteractively connected \u2026 we must admit that this relation\ndepends on a joint cause, on God, the universal principle of beings.\n\u2026The same pattern of the divine understanding, which generates\nexistence, also establishes the relations of things to each other, by\nconceiving their existences as correlated with each other. From this\nit is evident that the universal interaction of all things must be due\nto this \u2026 divine idea. (1:413.13\u201320)\n\nKant confidently concludes that his system of universal interaction\nis certainly (certe) better than the pedestrian theory of\nphysical influence. The reason, he explains, is that universal\ninteractivity (systema universalis substantiarum commercium,\n1:415.40) reveals the origin of the connection governing things, an\norigin that completely escapes ordinary physical influence because\nthis theory looks at substances in isolation (1:416)\u2014ignoring\nwhat happens among them, the dynamic \u201cbetween\u201d.\nKant was on a roll. He turned to writing his professorial thesis\nor habilitationsschrift, the Physical Monadology\n(1756).  Have established the fundamentality of \u201cthe\nbetween\u201d for both free events and mechanical causality (and\ntheir compatibility), Kant then turns to discuss what the\n\u201cbetween\u201d means with regard to the structure of\nmatter\u2014the physical manifestation of forces. Material things are\nextended\u2014they take up space. The terminal units of nature must\nbe point-entities, for if they weren\u2019t, they would be further\ndivisible and not be the final constituents.  Ontology suggests that\nspatial objects consist of final elements. Logic requires that final\nelements are indivisible, hence points. Geometry warns that points\nnever fill a volume, regardless how many are used. So how can points\nmake up the spatial things in nature? On the matrix-level, what\nhappens \u201cbetween\u201d the points?\nBuilding on his earlier works, Kant continues to expound that force\nis prior to extension; everything comes about through the dynamics of\nforce, pushes and pulls; and even on the smallest scale the\nattractive-repulsive interplay must structure space (determinata\nvolumina, 1:484.10\u201312). Bodies are coherent webs of\nforce-points. The dynamic point-entities are intelligible as\nmathematical centers, but dynamically, they are centers of active\nradiation fields that mutually confine each other. Physical monads are\nthus elementary energy spheres (sphaera activatis\nor ambitum activitatis; 1:481.9\u201310, 37). They are\npoints and, as such, indivisible\u2014but they radiate and in doing\nso create extension. Hence non-extended points constitute extended\ncomposites. We must think in dynamic terms, because corpuscular\ninterpretations of nature do not work, not even for the ether\n(1:486.5\u201335). As he writes at the end of the Physical\nMonadology, the ether is energetically structured space or\n\u201cfire matter\u201d (aether seu materia ignis;\n1:487.18), woven by elastic bonds (iunctae elasticitates;\n1:487.12).\nThe professorial thesis has the full title, \u201cthe use in\nnatural philosophy of the synthesis of metaphysics and geometry, whose\nfirst sample contains the physical monadology\u201d. Kant argues that\nthe combination of metaphysics and geometry can produce good\nphilosophy (1:473). According to him, it seems easier to mate griffins\nwith horses than to join exact science and conjecture\n(1:473.22\u20134), but truth is found in pursing just his course, the\n\u201cphysical monadology\u201d is a case in point.\nThe ultimate units, Kant\u2019s sphaera activatis, are terminal\nconcentrations of energy that stretch out as active dimensional\nspheres. This insight matches current theoretical physics. In current\nparticle physics, string theory conceives of force-points as closed\nvibrating loops that whip their exteriors into dimensional\nshape. Force generates extension\u2014even on the level of\nelements. From what science can tell today, the resulting dynamic\nspacelets, so-called Calabi-Yau spaces, are the smallest extension\nunits of reality.\nGeometry and conjecture lead to the origin of physical extension.\nCalabi-Yau spaces, the modern-day correlates to Kant\u2019s spheres, are\napproximated through quantum geometry. The units, superstrings (the\nbranes of M-theory seen on edge), are smaller than the empirical\nthreshold, the Planck length. Kant contended that the units are beyond\nthe measure of the sensible. Modern cosmologists would agree, both in\nthat investigating the absolutely large, the cosmos, necessarily leads\nto the investigation of the absolutely small, and in that this path\nleads from the empirical to the rational. The quest has become formal,\nand its physical pioneers are mathematicians. Beyond the scope of\nexperiments, the explorers of strings and branes today do conceptual\nwork. And like Kant, they stress the intelligible beauty of\nnature.\nThis conceptual work is guided by logical and aesthetic criteria,\nby elegance and simplicity. By Kant\u2019s own testimony, the contemplation\nof nature was for him an intensely aesthetic encounter. In\nthe Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the\nSublime (1764), his greatest public success before\nthe Critiques, he would develop a phenomenology of\nbeauty. Depending on the intensity of the experience, an aesthetic\nencounter can be either with beauty, exciting pleasure\u2014or with\nthe sublime, striking awe, sensual overload, even terror\n(2:208\u20139). Later, in the Critique of Judgment (1790),\nhe would argue for the heuristic value of aesthetic notions such as\ndesign and unity.\nWhen Kant was still working on the Physical Monadology, a\ntsunami shattered the coastal city Lisbon (1 November 1755). Fires\nbroke out in the chaos that merged into a firestorm incinerating the\nrubble. It was the worst earthquake recorded up to this point in\nWestern history; 70,000 people died. It struck on Sunday, which\nhappened to be a holiday (All Saints Day, Allerheiligen for\nKant). The twelve-meter (40 ft) high waves slammed at the city\nchurches just when the flocks had gathered. The impact destabilized\nthe towers, which collapsed backwards for static reasons, crashing\nthrough roofs and crushing whoever prayed below. The brothels, located\nfurther up in the hills, were spared. The faithful died, and the\nsinners survived.  This posed a theological challenge.\nKant wrote three papers on the catastrophe. The first, On the\nCauses of the Terrestrial Convulsions (1756), was an essay on the\nphysical dynamics of earthquakes; Kant speculated that there are giant\ncaves underneath mountain ridges (1:419\u201320). Sometimes gases in\nthe caves form combustible mixtures. When the gases release, the caves\ncollapse, shaking the earth (1:422). Although Kant\u2019s conjecture is\nfalse (quakes are usually due to plate tectonics), it is\nmethodologically beyond reproach, employing known data (mining\nexplosions) to formulate a testable hypothesis. The second\ntract, History and Natural Description of the Most Curious\nOccurrences associated with the Quake (1756), is a report on what\nhappened in Lisbon. The third, Further Observation on the\nTerrestrial Convulsions (1756), is a refutation of superstitious\ncauses such as invidious astrological conjunctions.\nIn all three essays, Kant insists on secular explanations.\nEarthquakes are terrible, but they are merely events in nature\n(1:420).  We do not know what they mean in the larger frame of things,\nand to interpret the Lisbon earthquake as a divine punishment is na\u00efve\nanthropocentrism.\nKant was interested in earthquakes not only because of the singular\nevent in Portugal, but also for the reason he wrote on winds,\nthe Theory of Winds (1756), and the West-Wind essay\n(1757). The most dramatic human encounters with natural forces are\nfire, storms, and earthquakes. Anyone intrigued by force would want to\nstudy these phenomena. Fire is pure energy. Earthquakes are the brutal\naction of force. And winds are the best examples of force moving\nthrough space. Meteorological phenomena in particular were an\nopportunity to apply the hypothesis of the force-space bond, the idea\nthat active, dynamic forces modify each other and that external\nmodifications of a radiation will affect the internal constitution of\nthem. Air masses can be modeled as these fluctuations, and weather\ninvolves a clear instantiation of dynamic interactivity.\nKant discovered that the direction-patterns of coastal winds are\nthe result of rhythmic thermal expansions and contractions of air\ncolumns over coastal and marine surfaces (1:223\u20134;\n1:492\u20134). But weather is not only due to the push and pull of\nenergies, the interaction of force (thermal radiation) and space (air\ncolumns over surface). As winds are motions in space, other motions\nmay drive them on. Rotational forces\u2014investigated in the\nearlier Spin-Cycle essay\u2014are especially important. They\nwere Kant\u2019s key for his discoveries, later confirmed, of the dynamic\nweather cycles responsible for trade winds, equatorial winds, and the\nmonsoon.\nAfter a hiatus of several years, in which high teaching loads\npermitted him to write only little, Kant turned to what would be the\nculmination of his systematic cosmology. As the New\nElucidation had already shown, the analysis of the interactive\nnatural community points to an absolute and transcendent ground. The\ncontemplation of nature inexorably leads to a reflection over the\nabsolute. Kant examined the perfection of dynamic interactivity and\nits sustaining divine unit in the Essay on Optimism (1759),\narguing that relative natural perfection amounts to the harmony of a\nmanifold with a rule, and that absolute divine perfection is such that\nits manifold contains within itself the ground of reality\n(2:30\u201331note). Their difference, in terms of reality or\nperfection, is just a matter of degree (2:31.16)\u2014the thrust and\nlimit of the cosmic vector. In 1762, now pushing forty, Kant resumed\nthis line of inquiry and wrote what would be his third book, Only\nPossible Ground of a Demonstration of God\u2019s Existence\n(1763). Kant explores there the divine limit of the natural vector.\n\u201cGod\u201d is defined as the necessary, unified, and constant\nbeing.\nThe first part of the Only Possible Ground contains an\nontological argument of the divine bond. Instead of regarding\nexistence as a predicate (2:70\u20134), Kant derives necessary\nexistence from possibility\n(2:77\u201384)[26]\n The bond governing nature is derivable from\nits intelligible possibility, and not from any anthropological story\nnor from the notion of a necessary being. The bond Kant describes is\nconsidered divine, but should not be confused with standard\nanthropological descriptions. One may employ and ontological argument,\nbut one should be clear on just what one is describing as a necessary\nbond.\nThe second part contains a teleological argument. Here Kant\nrestates parts of the Universal Natural History\n(2:93\u2013100, 123\u201351). Since few copies of that book had\nsurvived the publisher\u2019s bankruptcy, he wanted to repeat once more its\nsalient points\u2014while toning down, or omitting altogether, its\nmore provocative insights. Relevant for the topic was the immanent\nteleology of nature found in the Universal Natural\nHistory. In virtue of its own forces acting on matter, nature\nemerges as a uniform system that evolves to ever increasing order,\ndiversity, and complexity. The divine and active bond is the cosmic\nvector, and we can observe its design in nature\u2019s evolution. And since\nthe design derives from the \u201cinner possibility\u201d of objects\n(2:91\u20132), both conceptual and teleological arguments share the\nsame ground.\nThe divine bond is the unified and indispensable dynamis.\nThe corresponding traits of cosmic structure\u2014unity and\nharmony\u2014make Kant\u2019s argument from design possible. The third and\nfinal part of the Only Possible Ground contains his\nassessment of the ontological and teleological arguments. Only the\nformer qualifies, strictly speaking, as a proof (2:161\u20131). A\ncomparison reveals their differences. The one is a rigorous and\nconceptual demonstration, while the other is its probabilistic and\nempirical application. But truth is to be found in their harmony; both\nare rooted in the same key notion, possibility. Since empirical design\nis built into the intelligible dynamis of objects, both\narguments harmonize over the essence of the bond. This is why the book\nhas its peculiar structure: two arguments (Beweise) but one\nground (Beweisgrund), which is possibility,\nKant\u2019s M\u00f6glichkeit or Aristotle\u2019s dynamis.\n",
