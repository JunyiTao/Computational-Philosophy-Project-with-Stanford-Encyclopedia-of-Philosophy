He also provided, again arguably, the first\nexample of a particular significant function that is not\ncomputable. (Other examples, due independently to Kleene (1936) and\nTuring (1936) followed quickly.) He did this by constructing a\nfunction that is provably not recursive in the sense defined slightly\nearlier by G\u00f6del and Herbrand. He then appealed to the assumption\nthat any intuitively computable function is recursive to\nconclude that the function in question is not computable\u2014in\nChurch\u2019s terminology it is not effectively calculable.\n(We will continue to use the terms \u201ccomputable\u201d and\n\u201cintuitively computable\u201d rather than \u201ceffectively\ncalculable\u201d since they are more readily understood by\nnon-specialists.) Given the nature of this function, this meant that a\ncertain problem of elementary number theory is unsolvable: there is no\nway it could be solved by algorithmic means. It also implied a\nnegative solution to the Entscheidungsproblem first\nenunciated by Hilbert and Ackerman (1928): the problem whether there\nis a decision procedure for first order logic. The italicized\nassumption later came to be known as \u201cChurch\u2019s\nthesis\u201d (Kleene 1952).\n\nThe paper in which this result is presented, entitled \u201cAn\nUnsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory\u201d (1936a), is a\ngreat classic of logic and computability theory, but it has been\nsomewhat overshadowed by the almost contemporaneous and brilliant\npaper by Turing (1936), as well as the earlier remarkable\nincompleteness theorems of G\u00f6del (1931). In this section,\nChurch\u2019s paper takes center stage.\n\nSection 7 of Church\u2019s paper contains the first explicit\nformulation of Church\u2019s thesis (apart from a preliminary\nstatement in 1935c):\n\n\nWe now define the notion, already discussed, of an effectively\ncalculable function of positive integers by identifying it with the\nnotion of a recursive function of positive integers (or of a\nlambda-definable function of positive integers). This definition is\nthought to be justified by the considerations which follow, so far as\npositive justification can ever be obtained for the selection of a\nformal definition to correspond to an intuitive notion. (1936a [BE:\n119])\n\n\nChurch goes on to consider two natural ways one might seek to expand\nthe notion of computability beyond that of recursiveness (or\n\u03bb-definability) and he argued that each of these methods\nresults in functions that are already recursive (and\n\u03bb-definable) and so concludes:\n\n\nThus it is shown that no more general definition of effective\ncalculability than that proposed above can be obtained by either of\ntwo methods which naturally suggest themselves (1) by defining a\nfunction to be effectively calculable if there exists an algorithm for\nthe calculation of its values (2) by defining a function \\(F\\) (of one\npositive integer) to be effectively calculable if, for every positive\ninteger \\(m\\), there exists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(F(m)\n= n\\) is a provable theorem. (1936a [BE: 121])\n\n\nKleene (1952: 222\u2013223) discusses these two classic arguments for\nChurch\u2019s thesis. (See\n supplement A.2\n for further details.)\n",
