    "main_text": "Defining Public Goods and Distinguishing Between Different Kinds of Public Goods || Non-Rivalry and Non-Excludability\n1.1 Non-Rivalry and Non-Excludability\n\nEven though Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson is usually credited with\nhaving introduced the theory of public goods to modern economics\n(e.g., in Sandmo 1989), the origins of the idea go back to John Stuart\nMill, Ugo Mazzola (an Italian writer on public finance), and the\nSwedish economist Knut Wicksell (Blaug 1985: 218\u20139 and\n596\u20137]). Samuelson defined what he called a \u201ccollective\nconsumption good\u201d as:\n\n\n[a good] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each\nindividual\u2019s consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions\nfrom any other individual\u2019s consumption of that good\u2026.\n(Samuelson 1954: 387)\n\n\nIn the contemporary debate, this feature or characteristic of goods is\nusually referred to as \u201cnon-rivalry\u201d. A good is rivalrous\nif and only if an individual\u2019s consumption of it diminishes\nothers\u2019 ability to consume it. Bob\u2019s consumption of a\ngrain of rice makes it impossible for Sally to consume the same grain\nof rice. By contrast, Sally\u2019s enjoyment of Bruckner\u2019s\nSymphony No. 9 in no way diminishes Bob\u2019s ability to do the\nsame. Rice is thus rivalrous while music is\n not.[1]\n\n\nA few years after Samuelson, Richard Musgrave introduced an\nalternative criterion, that of (non-) excludability (Musgrave 1959).\nAs the name suggests, a good is excludable if and only if it is\npossible to prevent individuals from consuming it, to \u201cdraw a\nfence around it\u201d as it were. Land is thus a good that is\nconsidered excludable, while streetlight is not excludable: if Bob\npays for a streetlight to be installed, he cannot stop his neighbour\nSally from benefitting from it.\n\nIn contemporary economics, goods are usually defined as public goods\nif and only if they are both non-rivalrous and non-excludable\n(e.g., Varian 1992: 414). Rivalrous and excludable goods are called\nprivate goods. National defence is a paradigmatic example of a public\ngood. Not only does Sally\u2019s consumption of national defence not\nreduce Bob\u2019s consumption; she could not prevent him from\nconsumption if she tried. Food, clothes and flats are paradigmatic\nexamples of private goods.\n\nThere are also goods that are rivalrous and non-excludable and goods\nthat are non-rival and excludable. The former are sometimes called\n\u201ccommon pool resources\u201d (e.g., V. Ostrom & E. Ostrom\n1977, E. Ostrom et al. 1994; E. Ostrom 2003). An example is fish\nstocks. The latter are sometimes called \u201cclub goods\u201d\n(e.g., Mankiw 2012: 219; see also Buchanan 1965). Examples include\nwatching a movie in a cinema and the services provided by social and\nreligious associations.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the different types of goods that have\nbeen distinguished so far.\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nRivalrous\nNon-rivalrous\n\nExcludable\nPrivate goods (homesteads, bathroom cleaner)\nClub goods (Sports clubs, movie theatres)\n\nNon-excludable\nCommon resource goods (fish stocks)\nPublic goods: local (fire protection), national (national defence),\nglobal (climate mitigation measures), partial (parades)\n\nTable 1: Different kinds of economic goods\n\n",
