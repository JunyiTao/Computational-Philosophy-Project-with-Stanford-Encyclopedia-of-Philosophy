    "main_text": "A New Law of Thought || Applying the Analysis\n2.4 Applying the Analysis\n\nAs we have seen, Jones holds that all affirmative propositions are\nidentities. Applying the analysis can be less than straightforward,\nhowever. Consider her analysis of (1):\n\n(1)\n This small fragrant wild flower is Clematis.\n\n\nOn her view, \u2018this small fragrant wild flower\u2019 and\n\u2018Clematis\u2019 have the same extension, yet they possess\ndistinct intensions (Jones 1893\u201394, 36). Jones doesn\u2019t\nfully work out the details of this proposal, but the idea seems to be\nthat the extension of the subject term is identical to some\nClematis\u2014a subset of the things in the extension of\n\u2018Clematis\u2019.\n\nAs can be seen, the analysis assumes that predicate terms are\nimplicitly quantified. Jones held, following William Hamilton, that\nquantification is not restricted to subject terms, but applies to\npredicate terms as well (although the quantifier attaching to the\npredicate is never articulated). While Hamilton\u2019s doctrine of\nthe quantification of the predicate allowed for all sorts of\nmonstrosities (Kneale and Kneale, 1962, 352\u20134), the only cases\nthat Jones discusses involve quantifying the predicate with\n\u2018some\u2019, and assigning truth conditions to\n\u2018Q + S are some P\u2019 is\nrelatively straightforward:\n\n\nAll \\(S\\) is some \\(P\\)\n \\(|S - P^*| = 0\\)\nwhere\n\\(P^* \\subseteq P\\)\n\nSome \\(S\\) is some \\(P\\)\n\\(|S^* \\cap P^*| \\gt 0\\)\nwhere\n\\(S^* \\subseteq S\\) and \\(P^* \\subseteq P\\)\n\n\nIn each case, we get precisely the truth conditions we would have with\na quantifier-free predicate. E.g., \u2018All S is some\nP\u2019 is true just in case all S are\nP.\n\nThe endorsement of Hamilton\u2019s view might seem\nperverse\u2014and, in fact, Jones is elsewhere critical of his view\n(1906, 35\u20136)\u2014but it is necessary if Jones is to retain the\nview that significant assertion is, at root, the assertion of an\nidentity. After all, if \u2018All humans are mortal\u2019 asserts an\nidentity, then, given that identity is commutative, it entails the\napparently nonsensical \u2018Mortals are all humans.\u2019 The\nresult is at least intelligible if we suppose that the predicate is\nalso quantified\u2014if, that is, \u2018All humans are mortal\u2019\nis just \u2018All humans are some mortals.\u2019 For then, the\nconsequence would be \u2018Some mortals are all humans,\u2019 which\nis just the claim that some subset of the set of mortals is identical\nto the set of (all) humans. (This, of course, is not quite an identity\nstatement, since one of the terms is quantified, but it is the closest\nwe can get to a workable version of Jones\u2019s proposal.)\n\nHamilton\u2019s doctrine provides a straightforward explanation of\nthe validity of conversion. Indeed, Jones go so far as to claim that\nconversion itself presupposes some such approach: \u201cThe\npossibility of conversion\u2026 implies that the predicate, as well\nas the subject, of any proposition has denotation, and a denotation\nthat is implicitly quantified\u201d (1911b, 3; see also Jones, et al.\n1914\u201315, 364). To be clear, Jones has a non-standard conception of\nconversion, on which the converse of \u2018All humans are\nmortals\u2019 is \u2018Some mortals are humans\u2019 and not, as\nusually understood, \u2018All mortals are humans\u2019 (she follows\nKeynes 1906, \u00a796). Jones takes the former, fully articulated, to be\n\u2018All humans are some mortals.\u2019 Conversion switches the\npositions of the subject and predicate terms, giving us \u2018Some\nmortals are all humans\u2019. Of course, since the original and its\nconverse are both, at logical form, identity statements, this is just\nan instance of the commutativity of identity (Keynes 1906, \u00a7142).\n\n\nThe analysis is applied to a variety of statement forms (see 1911b,\n48\u201353). One cannot escape the impression, however, that Jones,\nlike the Oxbridge logicians generally, \u201cdissected with some\ncrude instruments\u201d (Grattan-Guinness 1985\u201386, 113). Indeed, as\nW. E. Johnson objected in an early exchange with Jones, the analysis\nseems to presuppose the very notion it seeks to\neliminate\u2014predication (Johnson 1892, 23). Consider (2):\n\n(2)\n Socrates is mortal.\n On Jones\u2019s analysis, (2)\u2019s logical form is given by\n\u2018Socrates is identical to some mortal.\u2019 Using contemporary\nnotation, this becomes (3) (recall that, for Jones, some\nmortal refers to a class):\n\n\n(3)\n\\(\\exists y (y\\in \\{x | \\textit{Mortal}(x)\\}\\amp \\textit{Socrates}=y)\\)\n\nAs Johnson notes, in thus specifying the set of mortals (\u2018the\nset of things x such that x is a mortal\u2019), we are invoking the\nrelation of predication\u2014the very notion that Lotze, and by\nimplication Jones, rejected as\n unintelligible.[1]\n (Jones responds in Jones 1893a.)\n\nStill, while the Law of Significant Assertion cannot be true in its\nfull generality, a restriction of the law to identity sentences is\nworth considering. Accordingly, in discussing Jones in relation to\nFrege and Russell, I will construe The Law of Significant Assertion as\na doctrine concerning identity sentences\u2014sentences of the form\na is b (where a and b are names,\ndemonstratives or descriptions and is functions accordingly\nas the is of identity, not predication)\u2014and not as a\nclaim about subject-predicate sentences generally.\n",
