Preliminaries\n\nR.G. Collingwood (1939) was an early advocate of taking questions\nseriously. In the decades since the publication of Collingwood\u2019s\nautobiography the topic of questions has regularly received attention\nfrom linguists, logicians, and philosophers of language, but few have\njoined Collingwood (1939, 36\u201337) in suggesting that\npropositional logic be replaced by a logic of question and answer in\nwhich neither question nor proposition is more basic. Instead, most\nwork on questions in the philosophy of language and in formal\nsemantics fits squarely within a reductive paradigm inspired \nby (if not perfectly reflective of) Frege in which\npropositions, declarative sentences, and assertion have primacy. The\nprimacy of the assertoric is especially evident in the work of many\nwho write on the semantics of what Belnap and Steel (1976) call\nelementary questions and who regard any such question as being\nidentifiable with a set or function involving the propositions that\nare the question\u2019s answers. Only relatively recently, an\nalternative to this reductive paradigm, taking up\nCollingwood\u2019s suggestion to replace classical logic with a logic\nof questions and propositions in which neither question nor\nproposition is seen as more basic, has gained traction under the\nheading of inquisitive semantics (Ciardelli et al.\n2018).\n1.1 Questions, answers, and presuppositions\n\nFamiliar considerations from the philosophy of language make it clear\nthat one should distinguish interrogative sentences from their\ncontents and distinguish both of these from the speech acts that can\nbe performed via the utterance of interrogative sentences. For\nexample, Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) understand a question to be an\nabstract thing for which an interrogative sentence is a piece of\nnotation. This parallels the distinction between propositions and the\ndeclarative sentences that express them. The structure and composition\nof a question (understood as the abstract content of an interrogative\nsentence) vary from theory to theory. The speech act of asking a\nquestion is standardly regarded, e.g., by Searle (1969, 69), as a\nspecial case of the illocutionary act of requesting. Searle\ndistinguishes requesting information (asking a real question) from\nrequesting that the hearer display knowledge (asking an exam\nquestion). \u00c5qvist (1965) connects questions with speaker\nknowledge rather than hearer knowledge by proposing that to ask a\nquestion is to command the hearer to cause the speaker to know the\nquestion\u2019s answer.\n\nAs is already clear, an important concept in many theories of\nquestions is that of an answer, sometimes called a direct\nanswer. Many theorists agree that an answer is a piece of\nlanguage or semantic object that, as Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) put\nit, \u201ccompletely, but just completely, answers the\nquestion.\u201d A sentence or proposition need not be true to be a\ndirect answer. Whether each question can be associated with a definite\nset of direct answers is a controversial matter, however. Most authors\nrequire answers to be sentences or propositions, so that answers to a\nquestion are the kind of thing that is true or false. Tichy (1978) is\na striking exception and argues that answers can be of any logical\ntype. Consider this example:\n\n(1) Who was the\nPresident of the USA in 1978?\n  a.\nJimmy Carter was the\nPresident of the USA in 1978. \n  b.\nGerald Ford was the\nPresident of the USA in 1978. \n  c.\nJimmy Carter\n\n  d.\nGerald Ford\n\n  e.\nSomeone over three\ninches tall was the President of the USA in 1978. \n\n\nMost theorists would say that (1a) is the correct answer to (1), that\n(1b) is an answer but not the correct answer, and that (1c\u2013e)\nare not answers to (1) at all. Tichy would say that, among\n(1a\u2013e), only (1c\u2013d) are answers, and (1c) is the correct\nanswer. Braun (2006) would count (1a\u2013b) as answers and include\n(1e) as both an answer and a correct answer. What these different\ntheoretical interpretations of the notion of an answer show is there\nis no univocal pre-theoretical notion of an answer. The notion should\nrather be seen as a technical one, which can differ from one theory to\nanother. Some theorists make explicit what they understand answers to\nbe, but some leave this implicit. This can be problematic: without\nexplication of which pre-theoretical construct the technical notion of\nan answer in a given theory is intended to capture, the theory cannot\nbe evaluated empirically.\n\nA second important basic concept connected with questions is that of a\npresupposition. Belnap and Steel (1976, 5) define a question\nas presupposing a statement if and only if the truth of the statement\nis a logically necessary condition for there being a true (i.e.,\ncorrect) answer to the question. For example, (1a) presupposes the\nfollowing:\n\n(2) The USA had exactly\none President in 1978.\n\n\nTo deny a presupposition of a question is to give a corrective\nanswer to the question, but most theorists join Belnap and Steel\nin not counting corrective answers as direct answers.\n1.2 Kinds of questions\n\nSeveral kinds of questions have been distinguished in the\nliterature.\n\nWhether-questions are questions like \u2018Was there a\nquorum at the meeting?\u2019 and \u2018Does Jones live in Italy, in\nSpain, or in Germany?\u2019. These examples illustrate that\nwhether-questions come in two varieties: a whether-question may be of\nthe yes-or-no variety, or it may present two or more alternative\ndirect answers other than yes and no. In either case, a\nwhether-question explicitly presents a finite number of direct\nanswers. Consider the first example:\n\n(3)Was there a quorum\nat the meeting?\n\n\na.\nThere was a quorum at the meeting.\n\n\nb.\nThere was no quorum at the meeting.\n\n\nThe answers to (3) are (3a\u2013b), and (3) presupposes that the\nmeeting occurred. Thus (4) is a corrective answer to (3):\n\n(4)\nThe meeting did not take place.\n\n\nQuestion (5) is ambiguous:\n\n(5)Does Jones live in\nItaly, in Spain, or in Germany?\n\n\na.\nJones lives in Italy.\n\n\nb.\nJones lives in Spain.\n\n\nc.\nJones lives in Germany.\n\n\nQuestion (5) can be read as a yes-no question having two direct\nanswers, but it also has a reading on which it presents exactly three\ndirect answers, namely (5a\u2013c). On the latter reading, (5)\npresupposes that Jones lives in Italy, in Spain, or in Germany; thus\n(6) is a corrective answer to (5):\n\n(6)Jones does not live\nin Italy, in Spain, or in Germany.\n\n\nWhich-questions are questions like \u2018What is the\nsmallest prime number greater than 12?\u2019, \u2018Which cardinal\nwas elected Pope in 2013?\u2019, and \u2018Who shot J.R.?\u2019\nUnlike a whether-question, a which-question may have an indefinite or\ninfinite number of direct answers.\n\nBelnap and Steel (1976) refer to whether- and which-questions as\nelementary questions. We consider these kinds of questions in\ndetail in section 2.\n\nAnother major category of questions are why-questions. It has\nlong been recognized that why-questions are intimately linked with the\nconcept of explanation. For example, Hempel and Oppenheim (1948, 334)\nwrite as follows:\n\nA scientific explanation may be regarded as an answer to a\nwhy-question, such as \u201cWhy do the planets move in elliptical\norbits with the sun at one focus?\u201d\n\n\nWe consider why-questions in detail in section 3.\n\nYet another major category of questions are embedded or\nindirect questions, which occur as complements of\nclause-embedding predicates such as \u2018know\u2019 and \u2018wonder\u2019:\n\n (7) John knows /\nwonders who spoke to Mary. \n\n\nThe issue of how to understand embedded questions lies at the\nintersection of the philosophy of language and epistemology and will\nbe treated in section 4.\n2. The semantics of elementary questions\n\nThis section provides an overview of some of the most prominent\ntreatments of elementary questions at the intersection of philosophy\nof language and formal semantics.\n2.1 Classical semantic theories of questions\n2.1.1 Hamblin semantics\n\nA common starting point for many formal semantic treatments of\nquestions is the idea that \u201cquestions set up a choice-situation\nbetween a set of propositions, namely those propositions that count as\nanswers to it\u201d (Hamblin 1973, 48). One way to implement this\nidea is to take a question to denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of\npropositions that correspond to a possible answer to the question\n(Hamblin 1973). Another way to implement the same idea is to let a\nquestion denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of propositions that\ncorrespond to its true answers in \\(w\\) (Karttunen 1977). In\nboth systems, the meaning of a question is a function from\nworlds to sets of propositions. In Hamblin\u2019s system, this\nfunction maps every possible world to the same set of propositions,\ncorresponding to the set of all possible answers; in Karttunen\u2019s\nsystem, every world is mapped to a subset of all possible answers,\nnamely those that are true in the given world. As acknowledged by\nKarttunen (1977, 10), the difference is inessential. In both cases,\nthe meaning of a question is fully determined by\u2014and could be\nidentified with\u2014the set of all propositions that correspond to a\npossible answer.\n\nA fundamental problem with these accounts is that they do not specify\nin more detail what \u201cpossible answers\u201d are supposed to be.\nOf course, they do provide a compositional semantics for a fragment of\nEnglish, and thereby specify what they take to be the possible answers\nto the questions in that fragment. But in order for these theories to\nbe evaluated, we first need to know what the notion of a\n\u201cpossible answer\u201d is intended to capture. To illustrate\nthis point, consider the following example:\n\n (8) Who is coming for\ndinner tonight? \n  a.\nPaul is coming.\n \n  b.\nOnly Paul and Nina are\ncoming.  \n  c.\nSome girls from my class\nare coming.  \n  d.\nI don\u2019t\nknow.  \n\n\nIn principle, all the responses in (8a\u2013d) could be seen as\npossible answers to (8). For Hamblin and Karttunen, only (8a) counts\nas such. However, it is not clear what the precise criteria are for\nbeing considered a possible answer, and on which grounds (8a) is to be\ndistinguished from (8b\u2013d).\n2.1.2 Partition semantics\n\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1984) take a question to denote, in each\nworld, a single proposition embodying the true exhaustive\nanswer to the question in that world. For instance, if \\(w\\) is a\nworld in which Paul and Nina are coming for dinner, and nobody else is\ncoming, then the denotation of (8) in \\(w\\) is the proposition\nexpressed by (8b).\n\nThe meaning of a question, then, is a function from worlds to\npropositions. These propositions have two special properties: they are\nmutually exclusive (since two different exhaustive answers\nare always incompatible), and together they form a cover of\nthe entire logical space (since every world is compatible with at\nleast one exhaustive answer). So the meaning of a question can be\nidentified with a set of propositions which form a partition\nof the logical space.\n\nIn many cases, it is intuitively clear what the \u201ctrue exhaustive\nanswer\u201d to a question in a given world is, at least much clearer\nthan what all the \u201cpossible answers\u201d to that question are.\nThis means that a partition semantics can in many cases be tested\nagainst clear intuitions, unlike a Hamblin semantics.\n\nHowever, in some cases it is not so clear what the \u201ctrue\nexhaustive answer\u201d to a question in a given world is. Consider\nthe following examples (in (10) we use \\(\\uparrow\\) and \\(\\downarrow\\)\nto indicate rising and falling intonation, respectively):\n\n (9) If Ann is coming,\nwill Bill come as well? [conditional question] \n (10) Is\nAnn\\(\\uparrow\\) coming, or Bill\\(\\downarrow\\)? [alternative\nquestion] \n\n\nWhat is the true exhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is\ncoming and Bill is coming as well? One option is the proposition\n\\(\\{w\\): Ann and Bill are both coming in \\(w\\}\\), but another option\nis the proposition \\(\\{w\\): if Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then Bill is\nalso coming in \\(w\\}\\). It is not quite clear pre-theoretically which\nof these two options is more suitable. Notice that if we pick the\nsecond option, then we must assume that the true exhaustive answer to\n(9) in a world where Ann is coming but Bill is not coming is \\(\\{w\\):\nif Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then Bill is not coming in \\(w\\}\\). And this\nwould mean that these two \u2018exhaustive\u2019 answers actually\noverlap (they both contain all worlds where Ann is not coming) and\nthus do not form a partition. This may be considered a reason to pick\nthe first option instead. However, this line of reasoning is purely\ntheory-internal; it seems impossible to decide on theory-external\ngrounds what the true exhaustive answers to a conditional question\nshould be taken to be. \n\nConditional questions like (9) also present another challenge for a\npartition semantics, concerning answers that deny the antecedent of\nthe conditional (in this case the answer that Ann is not coming).\nIntuitively, such answers dispel the issue raised by the question, but\ndo not resolve the issue as intended. Their status differs from\nanswers that do resolve the issue as intended (in this case the answer\nthat Bill is coming if Ann is coming, and the answer that Bill is not\ncoming if Ann is coming). In a basic partition semantics it is\nimpossible to capture this. In worlds where Ann is not coming, the\nanswer that Ann is not coming presumably is the true exhaustive\nanswer. Its special status, however, cannot be captured.\n\nA similar problem arises with alternative questions like (10). In this\ncase, the answer that neither Ann nor Bill is coming and the answer\nthat Ann and Bill are both coming have a different status than the\nanswer that only Ann is coming and the answer that only Bill is\ncoming. Again, this difference in status cannot be captured in a\nsimple partition semantics.\n2.2 Questions in dynamic semantics\n2.2.1 Updating equivalence relations\n\nWe now turn our attention to a line of work that aims to capture the\nsemantics of questions in a dynamic framework. The first\ntheories in this line of work were developed by J\u00e4ger (1996),\nHulstijn (1997), and Groenendijk (1999). Aloni et al. (2007b)\ncontains a collection of papers elaborating on these early proposals.\nAll these theories essentially reformulate the partition theory of\nquestions in the format of an update semantics (Veltman 1996). This\nmeans that they explicitly identify meanings with context change\npotentials, i.e., functions over discourse contexts. However,\nunlike a simple update semantics where discourse contexts are modeled\nas sets of worlds\u2014embodying the information established in the\ndiscourse so far\u2014these theories provide a more refined model of\ndiscourse contexts, one that also embodies the issues that have been\nraised so far. More specifically, a discourse context is modeled as an\nequivalence relation \\(R\\) over a set of worlds \\(C\\). The\nset of worlds \\(C\\), i.e., the domain of \\(R\\), can be thought of as\nthe context set, i.e., the set of all worlds that are\ncompatible with the information established in the discourse so far.\n\\(R\\) itself induces a partition on \\(C\\), and can thus be taken to\nencode the issues that have been raised so far. More specifically, we\ncan think of \\(R\\) as relating two worlds \\(w\\) and \\(v\\) just in case\nthe difference between \\(w\\) and \\(v\\) is not (yet) at issue, i.e.,\nthe discourse participants have not yet expressed an interest in\ninformation that would distinguish between \\(w\\) and \\(v\\). In other\nwords, \\(R\\) can be conceived of as a relation encoding\nindifference (Hulstijn 1997).\n\nBoth assertions and questions can then be taken to have the potential\nto change the context in which they are uttered. Assertions restrict\nthe context set \\(C\\) to those worlds in which the asserted sentence\nis true (strictly speaking, they remove all pairs of worlds \\(\\langle\nw,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) such that the asserted sentence is false in at\nleast one of the two worlds). Questions disconnect worlds,\ni.e., they remove a pair \\(\\langle w,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) just in\ncase the true exhaustive answer to the question in \\(w\\) differs from\nthe true exhaustive answer to the question in \\(v\\).\n\nThus, the dynamic framework of J\u00e4ger (1996), Hulstijn (1997), and\nGroenendijk (1999) provides a notion of context and meaning that\nembodies both informative and inquisitive content in a uniform way.\nHowever, the framework inherits several issues from the classical\npartition theory of questions, in particular those discussed above\nconcerning conditional and alternative questions.\n\nMoreover, there is a conceptual issue concerning the equivalence\nrelation \\(R\\). Namely, if \\(R\\) is primarily thought of as a relation\nencoding indifference, then it is not clear why it should\nalways be an equivalence relation. In particular, it is not\nclear why \\(R\\) should always be transitive. The discourse\nparticipants could very well be interested in information that\ndistinguishes \\(w\\) from \\(v\\), while they are not interested in\ninformation that distinguishes either \\(w\\) or \\(v\\) from a third\nworld \\(u\\). To model such a situation, we would need an indifference\nrelation \\(R\\) such that \\(\\langle w,u\\rangle \\in R\\) and \\(\\langle\nu,v\\rangle \\in R\\) but \\(\\langle w,v\\rangle \\not\\in R\\). This is\nimpossible if we require \\(R\\) to be transitive.\n2.2.2 Giving up transitivity\n\nThese concerns have been addressed by Groenendijk (2009) and\nMascarenhas (2009). The overall architecture of their system is very\nmuch like that of the early dynamic systems discussed above, only\nindifference relations are no longer defined as equivalence relations,\nbut rather as reflexive and symmetric (not necessarily transitive)\nrelations.\n\nGroenendijk and Mascarenhas argued that this adjustment, besides\naddressing the conceptual issue concerning indifference relations\ndiscussed above, also allows for a better analysis of conditional\nquestions and alternative questions. However, Ciardelli (2009) and\nCiardelli and Roelofsen (2011) show that, although the proposed system\nindeed behaves better for simple cases, it does not scale up to more\ncomplex cases in a suitable way. In particular, whereas alternative\nquestions with two disjuncts, like (10) above, are dealt with\nsatisfactorily, or at least more satisfactorily than in a partition\nsemantics, alternative questions with three or more disjuncts are\nstill problematic.\n\nThe gist of the problem can be illustrated with a simple example.\nConsider a language with three atomic sentences, \\(p, q\\), and \\(r\\),\nand an information state consisting of three worlds, \\(w_{pq},\nw_{qr}\\), and \\(w_{pr}\\), where the subscripts of each world indicate\nwhich atomic sentences are true at that world. Note that in this\ninformation state none of the atomic sentences is known to hold. Now\nconsider an issue which is resolved just in case at least one of the\natomic sentences is established, i.e., just in case we know that the\nactual world is located within one of the ovals depicted in figure\n1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An issue that cannot be\nrepresented in the pair-semantics.\n\n\nThe problem with the system of Groenendijk (2009) and Mascarenhas\n(2009) is manifested by the fact that this issue cannot be represented\nby means of an indifference relation. An indifference relation over\nthe information state \\(\\{w_{pq},w_{qr},w_{pr}\\}\\) necessarily\ncontains all reflexive world-pairs, and possibly one, two, or three\nnon-reflexive pairs. In either case, however, the resulting issue does\nnot correspond to the one depicted in Figure 1.\n\nThe general conclusion that has been drawn from this problem, as\ndiscussed in detail by Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2011), is that\nquestion meanings cannot be suitably modeled in terms of indifference\nrelations, even if these indifference relations are allowed to be\nnon-transitive. This insight has led to the development of an\nalternative logical notion of question meanings, which forms the\ncornerstone of the framework of inquisitive semantics, to be\ndiscussed below.\n2.3 Inquisitive semantics\n2.3.1 The basic system\n\nRecall from section 2.1.1 that a fundamental problem with the\nclassical semantic theories of Hamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977) is\nthat they do not specify clear criteria for when a response should\ncount as a \u201cpossible answer\u201d. Partition semantics\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984) does specify explicitly which responses\nshould count as possible answers, namely only those that are true and\nexhaustive. In many cases, it is clear what the true and exhaustive\nresponses to a given question are. However, this is not always the\ncase, as witnessed by conditional and alternative questions. A natural\nway to proceed, then, is to consider another criterion for what should\ncount as a possible answer.\n\nOne natural criterion is the following. We could say that a response\nto a question counts as a proper answer just in case it\nresolves the issue that the question raises. If we adopt this\ncriterion then we also have to impose a certain structural condition\non question-meanings. That is, question-meanings cannot just be\ndefined as arbitrary sets of propositions, as in the theories of\nHamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977). Rather, they should be defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions. That is, if a question\nmeaning contains a certain proposition \\(\\alpha\\), then it must also\ncontain all stronger propositions \\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\). After\nall, suppose that \\(\\alpha\\) is an element of the meaning of a\nquestion \\(Q\\). Given our answerhood criterion, this means that\n\\(\\alpha\\) corresponds to an issue-resolving response to \\(Q\\). But\nthen every \\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\) corresponds to an even more\ninformative, and therefore also issue-resolving response. So, given\nour answerhood criterion, \\(\\beta\\) must also be an element of the\nmeaning of \\(Q\\).\n\nThis conception of question meanings forms the cornerstone of the most\nbasic implementation of inquisitive semantics, the system\n\\(\\Inq_B\\) (Groenendijk and Roelofsen 2009, Ciardelli 2009, Ciardelli\nand Roelofsen 2011, Roelofsen 2013, Ciardelli 2016, Ciardelli et\nal. 2018). In this system, question meanings are defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions that together cover the entire\nlogical\n space.[1]\n We will refer to such sets as inquisitive question\nmeanings.[2]\n\nPartitions correspond to a specific kind of inquisitive question\nmeanings. That is, for every partition \\(\\rP\\), there is a\ncorresponding inquisitive question meaning \\(I_{\\rP}\\), consisting of\nall propositions that are contained in one of the blocks in\n\\(\\rP\\):\n\n\\(I_{\\rP} : = \\{\\alpha \\subseteq \\beta \\mid \\beta \\in \\rP\\}\\) \n\nHowever, not every inquisitive question meaning corresponds to a\npartition. In fact, an inquisitive question meaning \\(I\\) corresponds\nto a partition if and only if for every subset \\(I'\\subseteq I\\) such\nthat \\(\\cap I'\\ne \\varnothing\\), \\(\\cup I'\\) is also in \\(I\\). There\nare many inquisitive question meanings that do not have this special\nproperty. Thus, the notion of question meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\) is more\ngeneral than the notion of question meanings in partition\nsemantics.\n\nThe set of all meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\), together with a suitable notion\nof entailment, form a Heyting algebra, just like the set of all\nmeanings in classical logic ordered by classical entailment (Roelofsen\n2013). Thus, the basic connectives (disjunction, conjunction,\nimplication, and negation) can be associated with the basic algebraic\noperations on meanings (join, meet, and (relative)\npseudo-complementation), just as in classical logic. This is indeed\nhow the connectives are treated in \\(\\Inq_B\\), although other\ntreatments of the connectives are also conceivable in this setting\n(see, e.g., Ciardelli et al. 2015).\n2.3.2 Some extensions\n\nIn recent work, the basic system sketched above has been extended in\nseveral directions. Below are pointers to some of these\nextensions.\n\nCiardelli et al. (2012) consider a notion of meaning that is\nvery much like the one adopted in \\(\\Inq_B\\), but also has a\npresuppositional component. Such a notion of meaning is\nneeded to suitably deal with alternative questions and\nwhich-questions.\n\nCiardelli et al. (2017) develop a type-theoretic inquisitive\nsemantics, which is needed for a compositional semantic analysis of\nquestions.\n\nRoelofsen and Farkas (2015) develop an inquisitive semantics in which\nthe meaning of a question does not only capture what is needed to\nresolve the issue raised by that question, but also which propositions\nare made available by the question for subsequent anaphoric reference.\nThese propositions may serve as antecedents for polarity particles\n(e.g. Is Paul coming? Yes/No ) and other anaphoric\nexpressions (e.g. Is Paul coming? Then/otherwise I\u2019ll make\npasta ).\n\nFarkas and Roelofsen (2017) integrate inquisitive semantics with a\ncommitment-based model of discourse, in order to capture the special\ndiscourse effects of non-canonical types of questions, such as\ntag-questions (Paul is coming, isn\u2019t he? ) and\ndeclarative questions (Paul is coming? ).\n\nFinally, Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2015), Ciardelli (2016), and van\nGessel (2016) develop a system that integrates inquisitive semantics\nwith dynamic epistemic logic (van Ditmarsch et al.\n2007), in order to formally model the information states and\ninquisitive states of the participants of a discourse, and how these\nstates change when a question is asked or a statement is made. It also\nprovides a semantics for question-embedding predicates like\n\u2018know\u2019 and \u2018wonder\u2019 (see also section 4).\n2.4 Structured question meanings\n\nThe theories discussed above all construe question meanings as sets of\npropositions, and are therefore referred to as proposition\nset theories. It has been argued that question meanings as\nconstrued by proposition set theories are all too coarse-grained to\naccount for certain linguistic phenomena. In order to address this\nissue, several theories have been developed that adopt more\nfine-grained, structured notions of question meanings. Such\ntheories have been couched in different semantic frameworks, which are\nall more fine-grained than the standard possible world framework. For\ninstance, the proposal of Krifka (2001) is couched in a structured\nmeanings framework, that of Ginzburg and Sag (2000) in situation\nsemantics, that of Ginzburg (2005), Cooper and Ginzburg (2012) in type\ntheory with records, that of Aloni et al. (2007a) in dynamic\nsemantics, and that of Blutner (2012) in ortho-algebraic semantics. We\nwill illustrate the general approach here by focusing on the proposal\nof Krifka (2001), which in turn has its roots in earlier work of Hull\n(1975), Tichy (1978), Hausser (1978), von Stechow and Zimmermann\n(1984), von Stechow (1991), and Ginzburg (1992).\n\nThe central idea is that question meanings are pairs \\(\\langle\nB,R\\rangle\\), where \\(B\\) is called the background and \\(R\\)\nthe restriction. \\(B\\) is a function that, when applied to\nthe semantic value of an appropriate term answer to the question,\nyields a proposition. \\(R\\) specifies what appropriate term answers\nare, i.e., what the semantic entities are that \\(B\\) can be applied\nto.\n\nFor instance, the meaning assigned to (11a) is\n (11b):[3]\n\n (11)  a.\nWhich student\ncalled?  \n   b.\n\\(\\langle \\lambda\nx.\\lambda w.called(x)(w),\\text{ students}\\rangle\\) \n\n\n\nIn this case, \\(B\\) is a function that maps every individual \\(x\\) to\nthe proposition \\(\\{w: x\\) called in \\(w\\}\\), and \\(R\\) is the set of\nstudents. In the case of a polar question, \\(R\\) is taken to be a set\nconsisting of two functions on propositions, the identity function and\nthe function that maps every proposition to its complement, which are\nassumed to be expressed by yes and no, respectively.\nFor instance:\n\n (12)  a.\nDid Mary call?\n \n   b.\n\\(\\langle \\lambda\nf.f(\\lambda w.called(m)(w)),\\{\\lambda p.p,\\lambda p.\\neg\np\\}\\rangle\\)  \n\n\nFrom a structured question meaning it is always possible to obtain the\ncorresponding proposition set meaning, by applying \\(B\\) to all the\nelements of \\(R\\) (and taking the downward closure of the resulting\nset of propositions in case we want an inquisitive question meaning in\nthe sense of \\(\\Inq_B\\). It is not possible to go in the other\ndirection, which means that structured question meanings have strictly\nmore expressive power than proposition set meanings (e.g., von Stechow\n1991, Krifka 2001). \n\nThis additional expressive power is needed to account for certain\nphenomena. For instance, the questions in (13) and (14) have exactly\nthe same set of exhaustive/resolving answers, which means that they\nreceive exactly the same semantic value in any of the proposition set\naccounts discussed above.\n\n(13)Is the door open?\nYes. / No.\n(14)Is the door open or\nclosed? *Yes. / *No.\n\n\nYet, the two questions differ in that the first licenses answer\nparticles like \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 while the second\ndoesn\u2019t. In a structured-meanings approach, the two questions\nare semantically distinguishable. This additional semantic\nfine-grainedness forms the basis for an account of polarity particle\nresponses.\n\nNote that some of the extended implementations of inquisitive\nsemantics (e.g., Roelofsen and Farkas 2015) are also fine-grained\nenough to account for answer particles. As mentioned above, in these\nimplementations the meaning of a question does not only capture what\nis needed to resolve the issue that the question raises, but also\nwhich propositions are made available by the question for subsequent\nanaphoric reference, for instance by answer particles. In effect,\ncapturing anaphoric potential also adds structure to question\nmeanings. Thus, these implementations maintain a proposition set\nperspective, but at the same time address the need for richer semantic\nstructures as well. Such a synthesis is also achieved in Aloni et\nal. (2007a).\n2.5 Pointers to further reading\n\nThe overview provided here of semantic theories of elementary\nquestions is of course not exhaustive. There are a number of excellent\nrecent handbook articles, each focusing on different aspects.\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1997) provide a thorough review of the\nliterature up to 1997, focusing on the partition theory, but also\nsupplying an in-depth discussion of the epistemic-imperative approach\n(\u00c5qvist 1965, Hintikka 1976, Hintikka 1983) and the treatment of\nquestions in speech act theory (Searle 1969, Vanderveeken 1990).\n\nGinzburg (2010) provides a concise overview of several more recent\nanalyses of questions, including, besides the ones discussed here, the\ninferential erotetic logic of Wisniewski (2001), the\ntreatment of questions in modal logic by Nelken and Francez (2002) and\nNelken and Shan (2006), the dialogue-based approach of Ginzburg\n(1996), Ginzburg (2012), Roberts (1996), Larsson (2002), among others,\nthe SDRT based approach of Asher and Lascarides (1998), and the\ntreatment of questions in dynamic epistemic logic developed\nby van Benthem and Minic\u0103 (2012). For comparison of the latter\napproach with inquisitive semantics, see Ciardelli and Roelofsen\n(2015) and Ciardelli (2016).\n\nFinally, Krifka (2011) provides an overview of the classical\nproposition set accounts, early implementations of inquisitive\nsemantics, and the structured meanings approach, taking a more\nlinguistic perspective than other overview articles. Krifka does not\nonly discuss the semantics of questions, but also their possible\nsyntactic configurations and intonation patterns, supplying examples\nfrom a wide range of languages.\n3. Why-questions\n\nFor whether-questions (indeed, for all elementary questions in the\nview of some), the question-answer relationship can be defined in\npurely formal terms. One approach to why-questions is to try to make\nthe question-answer relationship formal in that case, too, or at least\nas formal as possible. The main proponent of this approach is\nBromberger (1966), whose account is also the first influential account\nof why-questions. Van Fraassen (1980) takes an opposite view,\ntheorizing that the question-answer relationship is almost purely\npragmatic. Skow (2016) proposes a theory that is neither formal nor\npragmatic but is instead metaphysical, claiming that answers to\nlower-level why-questions always identify causes or grounds. We\nconsider all three theories in some detail below.\n3.1 A formal approach: abnormic laws\n\nIf we follow Hempel in regarding an explanation as an answer to a\nwhy-question, Bromberger\u2019s theory of why-questions can be seen\nalso as a theory of explanation, indeed, one that incorporates\nHempel\u2019s deductive-nomological model while aiming to improve on\nit.\n\nBromberger introduces several concepts for use in his account: the\npresupposition of a why-question, abnormic laws and\ntheir antonymic predicates, and general rules,\nfocusing especially on general rules that are completed by\nabnormic laws.\n\nBromberger supposes that (15) is the general form of a\nwhy-question:\n\n(15)Why is it the case\nthat \\(p\\)?\n\n\nThe presupposition of (15) is \\(p\\), and this agrees with the usual\nconcept of presupposition for questions, since if \\(p\\) is not the\ncase then (15) has no correct answer. A general rule is a\n(true or false) law-like statement of the form:\n\n  \\(\\forall x(Fx\n\\rightarrow G\\)x), \n\n\nwhere \\(Fx\\) and \\(Gx\\) may, in the general case, be conjunctions. A\nspecial abnormic law is a true, law-like statement of the\nform:\n\n  \\(\\forall x(Fx\n\\rightarrow(Ex \\leftrightarrow(A_1 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee\nA_n\\)x))). \n\n\nSpecial abnormic laws satisfy five additional conditions of\nnon-triviality and non-redundancy that we need not get into, and\nBromberger (1966, 98) introduces the more complicated notion of a\ngeneral abnormic law, which we may also ignore for present purposes.\nThe predicate \\(E\\) appearing in a special abnormic law and\n\\(E\\)\u2019s negation are the antonymic predicates of the\nabnormic law. Bromberger (1966, 98) illustrates the concept of an\nabnormic law with the following example:\n\nNo sample of gas expands unless its temperature is kept constant but\nits pressure decreases, or its pressure is kept constant but its\ntemperature increases, or its absolute temperature increases by a\nlarger factor than its pressure, or its pressure decreases by a larger\nfactor than its absolute temperature.\n\n\nThe antonymic predicates of this special abnormic law are\n\u2018expands\u2019 and \u2018does not expand\u2019, and the\nlogical form that Bromberger\u2019s theory postulates for this\nabnormic law is as\n follows:[4]\n\n(16)  \\(\\forall x(Gx\n\\rightarrow(Ex \\leftrightarrow (Tx \\vee Px \\vee Ax \\vee Dx)))\\)\n\n\n\nBromberger (1966, 99) defines the completion of a general rule by an\nabnormic law as follows:\n\nAn abnormic law is the completion of a general rule if and only if the\ngeneral rule is false and is obtainable by dropping the\n\u201cunless\u201d qualifications. ([\u2026] this requires\nnegating the predicate substituted for \\(E\\)\u2014or dropping the\nnegation if it is already negated\u2014deleting the biconditional\nconnective, and making the obvious bracketing adjustments.)\n\n\nAbnormic law (16) is the completion of the (false) general rule\n\u2018No gas expands\u2019:\n\n(17)  \\(\\forall x(Gx\n\\rightarrow \\neg Ex)\\) \n\n\nBromberger (1966, 100) goes on to define the correct answer to a why\nquestion as follows: \\(q\\) is the correct answer to (15) if and only\nif (i) there is an abnormic law \\(L\\) (which may be general or\nspecial) and \\(p\\) is the proposition that results from predicating of\nsome individual one of the antonymic predicates of \\(L\\); and (ii)\n\\(q\\) together with \\(L\\) and other premises \\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\)\nconstitute a deductive-nomological explanation with conclusion \\(p\\);\nand (iii) there is a false proposition \\(s\\) such that \\(s\\) and \\(p\\)\nare contraries and, were it not for the falsity of \\(s\\) and \\(L\\),\npremises \\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\) and the general rule completed by \\(L\\)\nwould count as a deductive-nomological explanation of \\(s\\); and (iv)\nthe general rule completed by \\(L\\) is such that if one of the\nconjuncts of its antecedent is removed, the resulting general rule\ncannot be completed by an abnormic law.\n\nHere is an illustration of Bromberger\u2019s theory based on abnormic\nlaw (16). Suppose \\(a\\) is a sample of gas that expanded, and suppose\nits pressure was kept constant but its temperature increased, i.e.,\n\\(Ga\\), \\(Ea\\), and \\(Pa\\) are all true. Now consider the\nquestion:\n\n(18) Why did \\(a\\)\nexpand? \n\n\nOn Bromberger\u2019s theory, the correct answer is \\(Pa\\), i.e., \n\n (19) The pressure of \\(a\\) was\nkept constant while the temperature of \\(a\\) increased. \n\n\nThis is the correct answer because \\(Pa\\), along with \\(Ga\\) and\nabnormic law (16) form the premises of a deductive-nomological\nexplanation with conclusion \\(Ea\\), but when \\(Pa\\) is deleted as a\npremise (leaving \\(Ga\\) as a premise) and general rule (17) is\nsubstituted for abnormic law (16) as a premise, we obtain argument\n(20), which would count as a deductive-nomological explanation of\n\\(\\neg Ea\\), were it not for the fact that (17) and \\(\\neg Ea\\) are\nnot true: \n\n (20)  \\(a\\) is a\nsample of gas; no sample of gas expands; therefore \\(a\\) did not\nexpand, i.e., \\(Ga\\); \\(\\forall x(Gx\\rightarrow \\neg Ex)\\); therefore\n\\(\\neg Ea\\).  \n\n\nSo, in this application of Bromberger\u2019s theory, \\(p\\) is \\(Ea\\),\n\\(q\\) is \\(Pa\\), \\(L\\) is (16), the general rule completed by \\(L\\) is\n(17), \\(r_1\\) is \\(Ga\\), and \\(s\\) is \\(\\neg Ea\\).\n\nIntuitively, Bromberger\u2019s account makes \\(Pa\\) the correct\nanswer to (18) in virtue of the idea that \\(Pa\\) is a full\nspecification of the special (or \u201cabnormal\u201d) circumstances\ntriggering the expansion of \\(a\\). Notice that one of the premises of\nthe deductive-nomological explanation of \\(Ea\\), namely \\(Ga\\), is not\npart of the triggering package and is not part of the correct answer\nto (18). Two factors in Bromberger\u2019s account jointly keep \\(Ga\\)\nfrom being included. The first is that \\(Ga\\) is a premise not only in\nthe actual deductive-nomological explanation of \\(Ea\\) but also in the\nfictitious deductive-nomological explanation (20) of \\(\\neg Ea\\). So\nrelative to (16) and (17), \\(Ga\\) is not a special or abnormal\ncircumstance. Is there another abnormic law/general rule pair relative\nto which \\(Ga\\) would be included in the correct answer to (18)?\nApparently not, which brings us to the second factor excluding \\(Ga\\)\nfrom the correct answer to (18): if \\(Gx\\) is dropped from (17) we\nobtain the general rule \u2018Nothing expands\u2019, which it seems\nthat no abnormic law\n completes.[5].\n\nBromberger\u2019s theory was aimed at saving certain intuitions about\nwhat should and should not count as correct answers to why-questions.\nFor example, consider a straight, 40-foot high utility pole standing\nperpendicular to the ground. A taut 50-foot wire is fastened to the\ntop of the pole and to a point on the ground 30 feet from the base of\nthe pole. Now consider the question:\n\n (21) Why is the height\nof the pole 40 feet? \n\n\nand the intuitively incorrect answer \n\n (22)  Because there is\na 50 foot wire that is tautly stretched between the top of the pole\nand a point 30 feet from the base of the pole.  \n\n\nBromberger (1966, 105) argues that (22) does not count as a correct\nanswer to (21) on his theory in part because the following is not an\nabnormic law:\n\n (23)  No pole that is\nstraight and perpendicular to the ground is 40 feet high unless there\nis a 50 foot wire that is tautly stretched between the top of the pole\nand a point 30 feet from the base of the pole.  \n\n\nNor would (23) become an abnormic law if additional disjuncts were\nadded after \u2018unless\u2019.\n\nTeller (1974) argues that while (22) may not count as a correct answer\nto (21) on Bromberger\u2019s theory, other answers that are as\nobjectionable as (22) do get counted as correct answers, such as this\n\u201cdispositional\u201d answer to (21):\n\n (24)  Because if a 50\nfoot wire were tautly stretched from the top of the pole to the\nground, it would touch the ground at a point 30 feet from the base of\nthe pole.  \n\n\nTeller (1974, 375) argues that Bromberger\u2019s theory requires that\n(24) count as a correct answer in virtue of the following abnormic\nlaw:\n\n (25)  No pole that is\nstraight and perpendicular to the ground is 40 feet high unless it is\nsuch that if a 50 foot wire were tautly stretched from the top of the\npole to the ground, it would touch the ground at a point 30 feet from\nthe base of the pole.  \n\n\nTeller proposes other counterexamples by devising a method for turning\nexamples showing that Hempel\u2019s deductive-nomological theory of\nexplanation is too permissive into examples showing that\nBromberger\u2019s theory of why-questions is also too permissive.\nTeller\u2019s method exploits the fact that when abnormic laws are\nrewritten in certain logically equivalent ways, the resulting\nstatements must then also count as abnormic laws.\n3.2 A pragmatic approach: explanatory contrast\n\nA second major development in the theory of why-questions is the\naccount of van Fraassen (1980, ch. 5). Van Fraassen\u2019s theory is\nmotivated by the idea that explanation is not a special relationship\nbetween theory and reality. Rather, an explanation is just a\ndescription of reality that serves a contextually determined\npurpose, namely that of answering a why-question. Van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory is thus an erotetic (i.e., question-theoretic) theory of\nexplanation, as opposed to an account of why-questions in terms of\nexplanation. He offers this theory in the context of developing his\naccount of Constructive Empiricism. \n\nFor van Fraassen, a why-question \\(Q\\) can be identified with a triple\n\\(\\langle P,X,R\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) is a true proposition (the\ntopic of the question); \\(X\\) is a set of propositions to\nwhich \\(P\\) belongs and of which \\(P\\) is the only member that is true\n(the contrast class of \\(Q)\\); and \\(R\\) is a contextually\ndetermined relation of explanatory relevance, which holds between a\nproposition and the topic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\).\nThe standard linguistic expression of \\(Q\\) is:\n\n (26)  Why \\(P\\) in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X\\)?  \n\n\nFor example, consider \u2018Why do birds in the northern hemisphere\ngo south for the winter, whereas mammals and reptiles do not?\u2019\nIn this case, \\(P\\) is the proposition that birds in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter, and \\(X\\) is the set containing\n\\(P\\) along with the proposition that mammals in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter and the proposition that reptiles\nin the northern hemisphere go south for the winter. The contrast class\nparameter allows one to distinguish different why-questions that have\nthe same topic. Thus one can ask why northern hemisphere\nbirds (rather than mammals or reptiles) go south for the\nwinter, and this is different from asking why northern hemisphere\nbirds go south (rather than north or west) for the winter.\nUntil one specifies a contrast class, van Fraassen argues, a\nparticular why-question has not been identified or posed. Like van\nFraassen, Garfinkel (1981) advances a view on which explanatory\ncontrast takes center stage, but we will focus here on the details of\nvan Fraassen\u2019s account. See Temple 1988 for a comparison of van\nFraassen\u2019s and Garfinkel\u2019s respective treatments of\nexplanatory contrast.\n\nSuppose that \\(X=\\{P,P_1 ,\\ldots ,P_k,(\\ldots)\\}\\), and that \\(P\\) is\nnot one of the \\(P_k\\)s. (Note that \\(X\\) may be finite or infinite.)\nThen, where \\(A\\) is any proposition, van Fraassen (1980, 144) defines\na direct answer to \\(Q\\) to be any proposition having the following\ntruth conditions:\n\n(27)\\(P\\) and, for all\n\\(k\\ge 1\\), \\(\\neg P_k\\), and \\(A\\).\n\n\nThe standard wording of a direct answer (28) to \\(Q\\) uses the word\n\u2018because\u2019 in place of the second \u2018and\u2019 in\n(27):\n\n(28)\\(P\\), in contrast\nto the rest of \\(X\\), because \\(A\\).\n\n\nOn van Fraassen\u2019s view, the contribution of\n\u2018because\u2019 to the truth conditions of (28) is simply\nboolean conjunction, as reflected in (27). The role of\n\u2018because\u2019 in (28) is to perform the pragmatic function of\nindicating that (27) is being used for an explanatory purpose, not to\ngive a non-truth-functional dimension to the truth conditions of (28).\nProposition \\(A\\) (the core of answer (27)/(28)) is said to be\nrelevant to \\(Q\\) iff \\(A\\) bears the relevance relation \\(R\\) to\n\\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\). In general, to ask why is to ask for a reason,\nand \\(R\\) varies according to the kind of reason that is being\nrequested in a given context. One can ask why in order to request\ncausal factors, to request a justification, to request a purpose, to\nrequest a motive, to request a function, and so on.\n\nA why-question, according to van Fraassen (1980, 144\u2013145)\npresupposes (i) that its topic is true, (ii) that, in its contrast\nclass, only its topic is true, and (iii) that at least one proposition\nbearing the explanatory relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class\npair is true. When the first or second presupposition fails (because\nthe contextually determined body of background knowledge in play does\nnot entail both (i) and (ii)), the why-question does not\narise. When the third presupposition fails, the why-question has\nno answer even if it arises. For example, suppose that paresis\nindeterministically strikes some people who have untreated syphilis.\nThen, if ten people have untreated syphilis, and exactly one of them,\nJohn, goes on to contract paresis, there may be no answer to the\nquestion \u2018Why did John, in contrast to the other nine, contract\nparesis?\u2019 Since paresis develops indeterministically from\nsyphilis, nothing favors John (in contrast to the other nine syphilis\npatients) as being likely to develop paresis. On the other hand, if\nBill and Sarah never had syphilis, the question \u2018Why did John,\nin contrast to Bill and Sarah, develop paresis?\u2019 does have an\nanswer: \u2018John developed paresis, in contrast to Bill and Sarah,\nbecause John had syphilis but Bill and Sarah did not.\u2019 In this\ncase, as in the first, the why-question requests causal factors that\nled to John\u2019s getting paresis while the others mentioned in the\ncontrast class did not. In both cases, then, the same relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) is in play because the same kind of information is\nrequested, namely causal factors leading to the truth of the topic in\ncontrast to the other members of the contrast class. If there are no\nsuch causal factors, as in the first version of the paresis case, the\nquestion is to be rejected. If, as in the second version of the\nparesis case, there are such factors, so that at least one proposition\nbears the relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class pair, then a\ncandidate answer \\(A\\) is evaluated according to three criteria: how\nacceptable or likely \\(A\\) is, the degree to which \\(A\\) favors \\(P\\)\nover other members of \\(X\\), and whether \\(A\\) is made irrelevant by\nother answers.\n3.2.1 How-questions and explanatory contrast\n\nVan Fraassen\u2019s theory of why-questions is intended as a theory\nof explanation, but why-explanation seems not to be the only kind of\nexplanation there is. Cross (1991) argues that answers to\nhow-questions are explanations, too, and, building on van\nFraassen\u2019s theory of why-questions, Cross offers a theory of\nhow-questions that ultimately unifies why- and how-explanation in a\nsingle theory of explanatory questions.\n\nFirstly, it must be noted that not every how-question requests an\nexplanation. For example, \u2018How far is it to Cleveland?\u2019\nasks for a distance, not an explanation. In general, according to\nCross (1991, 248), a how-question is explanation-seeking whenever\n\u2018how\u2019 can be paraphrased as \u2018in what way\u2019.\n\nSecondly, ways, like reasons, come in a variety of kinds (Cross 1991,\n248\u20139):\n\n(29)a.By\nwhat road (How did you\nget here?)\nb.In\nwhat manner (How did\nyou behave at the party?)\nc.By\nwhat argument (How\nwill you justify this?)\nd.By\nwhat method (How do\nyou perform an appendectomy?)\ne.By\nwhat means (How did\nyou get that money?)\nf.In\nwhat respect (How do\nthese differ?)\ng.By\nwhat process (How do\nDNA molecules replicate?)\n\n\nThirdly, Cross argues that one can see phenomena of explanatory\ncontrast in how-questions in such examples as the following: \n\n(30)a.How\ndo DNA molecules (in\ncontrast to molecules of benzene and hexane)\nreplicate?\nb.How\ndo reptiles (in\ncontrast to mammals and birds) reproduce?\n\n\nThe linguistic form (31) of a how-question and its answer (32),\naccording to Cross, are as follows, where, as in van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory, the contrast class \\(X\\) is a set of propositions containing\n\\(P\\): \n\n (31) How is \\(P\\) (in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) the case? \n (32) \\(P\\) (as\ncontrasted with the rest of \\(X)\\) in this way: \\(A\\). \n\n\nNotice, however, that whereas in (30a) the propositions in \\(X\\) other\nthan \\(P\\) are false, in (30b) all three members of \\(X\\) are true:\nbirds, mammals, and reptiles reproduce. This, Cross argues, reflects\nthe fact that how-questions can exhibit two different kinds of\nexplanatory contrast. By asking (30a) one requests an answer that\nhighlights those special qualities of DNA that enable it to replicate\nand that benzene and hexane do not possess. By asking (30b), on the\nother hand, one requests an answer that highlights the differences\nbetween the way in which reptiles reproduce and the ways in which\nmammals and birds reproduce. The latter kind of explanatory contrast\nalso appears to be at play when (30b) is re-worded this way:\n\n (33) I know how\nmammals and birds reproduce, but how do reptiles\nreproduce? \n\n\nIn view of this, Cross introduces a contextual parameter in his\naccount of how-questions to indicate whether a given how-question\npresupposes that all members of the contrast class are true or whether\nit presupposes that all members of the contrast class other than \\(P\\)\nare false. In the resulting account, a how-question is an ordered\nquadruple \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) is the topic of the\nquestion; \\(X\\) is the contrast class, which is a set of propositions\nto which \\(P\\) belongs; \\(R\\) is a contextually determined relation of\nexplanatory relevance, which holds between a proposition and the\ntopic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\), and \\(n\\) is the\ncontrast value 0 or 1. If \\(n = 0\\), the question presupposes that in\n\\(X\\) only \\(P\\) is true; if \\(n = 1\\), the question presupposes that\nall of the members of \\(X\\) are true. The explanatory relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) is to be understood as varying from context to context\ndepending on what kind of way is being requested in that context.\nFinally, Cross (1991, 252) defines a direct answer to a how-question\nas follows:\n\n (34) A proposition\n\\(B\\) is a direct answer to \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\) iff there is\nsome proposition \\(A\\) such that \\(A\\) is relevant to \\(\\langle\nP,X,n\\rangle\\) and if \\(n = 0\\), then \\(B\\) is the proposition which\nis true iff \\(A\\) and \\(P\\) are true and every \\(C\\) such that \\(C\\in\nX\\)\\\\(\\{P\\}\\) is false, and if \\(n= 1\\), then \\(B\\) is the proposition\nwhich is true iff \\(A\\) and all members of \\(X\\) are true.\n\n\n\nHaving found examples in which how-questions have contrast value 1,\nCross argues that why-questions, too, can presuppose that the other\nmembers of their contrast classes are true. Consider a therapy meeting\nfor alcoholics in which each member of the group is asked the\nfollowing question:\n\n (35) Why did\nyou (in contrast to the other members of the group) start\ndrinking too much? \n\n\nIn this case it appears that the asker is requesting an answer that\nhighlights factors that distinguish the alcoholism of the person to\nwhom the question is addressed from that of the others in the group.\nThis and other evidence leads Cross to conclude that how- and\nwhy-questions are the same kind of question\u2014both are\nexplanatory questions\u2014and both can be represented as\nhaving the structure \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\). If a proposition\n\\(A\\) must be a reason for \\(P\\) (in contrast to the rest of\n\\(X)\\) in order to bear relation \\(R\\) to \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\),\nthen the question is worded with \u2018why\u2019 and the answer with\n\u2018because\u2019; if \\(A\\) must be a way for \\(P\\) to be\nthe case (in contrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) in order to bear relation\n\\(R\\) to \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\), then the question is worded with\n\u2018how\u2019 and the answer with \u2018by\u2019, \u2018in this\nway\u2019, or similar wording. \n\nIt is possible to accept Cross\u2019s theory as a theory of\nhow-questions only and to resist the final move of unifying how- and\nwhy-questions into a single species of question. The unification that\nCross proposes assumes that why-questions can have contrast value 1,\nbut Risjord (2000, 73\u20134) argues that instead of accepting that\n(35) is a why-question with contrast value 1, one can instead analyze\nit as a why-question with contrast value 0 that makes reference to the\ntopics of other why-questions (also having contrast value 0) that have\nbeen or could be raised in the given context.\n3.2.2 Criticisms of the pragmatic/contrastivist approach\n\nKitcher and Salmon (1987) were early critics of van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory of why-questions as a theory of explanation. They object (1987,\n319) that the lack of constraints on the relevance relation \\(R\\)\n\u201callows just about anything to count as the answer to just about\nany [why-]question.\u201d Other critics of van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory include Ruben (1987) and Temple (1988), who argue that\nexplanatory contrast is an unnecessary complication because any\ncontrastive why-question \u2018why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?\u2019 is equivalent to the non-contrastive why-question\n\u2018why P&\\(\\neg\\)Q?\u2019. Risjord (2000, 70) rebuts this\nreduction of the contrastive to the non-contrastive by arguing that it\nleads to the untenable result that whenever \\(P\\) entails both\n\\(\\neg\\)Q and \\(\\neg\\)R, \u2018why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?\u2019 must then be logically equivalent to \u2018why \\(P\\)\n(in contrast to \\(R)\\)?\u2019, since \\(P \\amp \\neg Q\\) is logically\nequivalent to \\(P \\amp \\neg R\\) if \\(P\\) entails \\(\\neg Q\\) and \\(\\neg\nR\\). But questions of these forms need not be equivalent, since they\nmay call for different answers. For example, if Art is a vegan and is\nallergic to chocolate, a correct answer to \u2018Why did Art eat\nfruit for dessert (rather than eating ice cream and skipping the\nfruit)?\u2019 will cite his being a vegan and not his chocolate\nallergy, whereas a correct answer to \u2018Why did Art eat fruit for\ndessert (rather than eating chocolate and skipping the fruit)?\u2019\nwill cite his chocolate allergy but not his being a vegan.\n3.2.3 Other versions of the contrastivist approach\n\nWhere van Fraassen\u2019s theory places few restrictions on the\ncontrast class or foils of a why-question, some authors have\nargued that the set of possible foils is constrained in various ways.\nOne example is Sober (1986), who contends that the presuppositions of\n\u2018Why \\(P\\) rather than \\(Q\\)?\u2019 include a two-part common\ncause presupposition, namely that (1) the truth of \\(P\\) and the\nfalsity of \\(Q\\) trace back to a common cause, and (2) the common\ncause discriminates \\(P\\) from \\(Q\\) in the sense that it makes \\(P\\)\nmore likely than \\(Q\\). Both presuppositions fail for Sober\u2019s\n(1986, 145) example of the unanswerable question, \u2018Why is Kodaly\na Hungarian rather than a vegetarian?\u2019 Another author who argues\nfor additional constraints on foils is Lipton (1990), who aims in part\nto improve on Lewis\u2019s (1986) account of causal explanation.\nLipton contends that a causal answer to \u2018Why \\(P\\) rather than\n\\(Q\\)?\u2019 must cite a cause of \\(P\\) and the absence of a\ncorresponding event in the history of \\(\\neg Q\\), i.e., a causal\ndifference between \\(P\\) and \\(\\neg Q\\). Lipton (1990, 256) calls this\nThe Difference Condition. The central requirement for a sensible\ncontrastive question is that fact and (negated) foil have a similar\ncausal history against which the differences stand out (Lipton 1990,\n258). According to Barnes (1994), Lipton is correct that fact and\n(negated) foil must have a similar causal history, but Barnes goes\nfurther and claims that a why-question presupposes that the fact and\nfoil can be viewed as culminating outcomes of some single type of\nnatural causal process (Barnes 1994, 50).\n3.3 A metaphysical approach: answers as reasons-why\n\nA notable recent development in the discussion of why-questions is\nSkow 2016, which begins with two key ideas: first, that a theory of\nexplanation ought to be a theory of answers to why-questions, and,\nsecond, that a theory of answers to why-questions is a theory of\nreasons-why. Skow goes on to defend the view that all reasons-why are\ncauses or grounds, and he argues that reasons-why come in levels. At\none level there are reasons why \\(P\\), and at a higher level there are\nreasons why \\(Q\\) is a reason why \\(P\\). For example, if I strike a\nmatch and the match lights, my striking the match is a reason why the\nmatch lit, and the relevant physical laws are reasons why striking the\nmatch is a reason why it lit. These physical laws are not lower-level\nreasons (i.e., reasons why the match lit); thus the higher and lower\nlevels are distinct. The levels are not strictly disjoint, however, as\nthe presence of oxygen in the air is both a reason why the match lit\nand a reason why striking the match is a reason why it lit.\n\nIn the history of theorizing about explanation, Skow argues, the\nhigher and lower levels of reasons-why have been conflated as far back\nas the Deductive-Nomological theory of Hempel and Oppenheim (1948).\nAccording to the D-N model, an answer to the question of why an event\noccurred must cite both prior conditions and a law of nature, and the\noccurrence of the explanandum event must be deducible from the latter\njointly. For example, certain physical laws are involved in the\nlighting of a match when it is struck. According to the D-N model, but\nnot according to the account of reasons-why in Skow 2016, those laws\nare part of the explanation of why the match lit.\n\nWhile acknowledging the distinction between first- and second-level\nreasons-why, Lawler (2019) argues that second-level reasons (in\nparticular, the laws of nature that mediate cause and effect) are\nproperly included in answers to why-questions. If Lawler is right,\nthen, contrary to the account in Skow 2016, an answer to a\nwhy-question need not be a cause or ground.\n\nAnother critic of Skow 2016 is V\u00e4yrynen (2019), who argues that\nwhile Skow\u2019s theory ought to apply to normative explanation as\nwell as to empirical explanation, the theory does not account for\nreason-enablers that are important in normative explanation. Consider\nthe question of why I ought to shovel the snow from my neighbor\u2019s\nsidewalk. That I can do it, V\u00e4yrynen argues, enables other facts\nto be reasons why I ought to, but that I can do it may be neither a\nreason why I ought to do it nor a reason why some other fact is a\nreason why I ought to do it.\n3.4 Pointers to further reading\n\nAside from the the formal, pragmatic, and metaphysical approaches, the\ntopic of why-questions has been somewhat neglected by philosophers, at\nleast compared to other topics in the theory of questions. A notable\nexception is Hintikka and Halonen 1995, which develops a theory of\nwhy-questions in the context of Hintikka\u2019s interrogative model\nof inquiry.\n4. Embedded (or indirect) questions\n\nInterrogative expressions can serve as the argument of certain\nclause-embedding predicates, as when someone is said to know, tell,\ncare, or wonder who, what, whether, how, or why. Where the attitude\npredicate is knowledge, these sorts of examples are called cases of\nknowledge-wh. Knowledge-how in the sense of skill-possession,\nas in \u2018Smith knows how to ride a bicycle\u2019, has generated a\nliterature of its own and is treated elsewhere (see the entry on\n knowledge how).\n \n\nThe discussion of knowledge-wh has focused mostly on whether-, what-,\nwhich-, and who-complements, as in these examples:\n\n (36) John knows\nwhether the closet is empty. \n (37) John knows what\nis in the closet. \n (38) John knows who\ncame to the meeting. \n (39) John knows where the meeting\nwas held. \n\n\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1982) provide a rich source of examples of\nintuitively valid and invalid inferences involving wh-complements,\nsuch as the following intuitively valid inference (179):\n\n (40) John believes\nthat Bill and Suzy walk; only Bill walks; hence, John doesn\u2019t\nknow who walks. \n\n4.1 Knowledge-wh and the imperative-epistemic theory of wh-questions\n\nKnowledge-wh figures explicitly in the imperative-epistemic theory\nof wh-questions developed by \u00c5qvist (1965). The\nimperative-epistemic account is further developed by Hintikka (1975,\n1976) and has been influential among philosophers of science\ninterested in models of inquiry and discovery, such as Kleiner\n(1993).\n\nAccording to the imperative-epistemic account, to ask a question is to\nissue an imperative requiring the addressee to bring it about that the\nspeaker knows the answer to the question. Knowledge-wh comes into it\nbecause to know the answer is to be in a state that can be described\nusing a knowledge-wh sentence. For example, according to the\nimperative-epistemic account, question (41) is to be understood as\nimperative (42):\n\n (41) Is the cat on the\nmat? \n (42) Bring it about\nthat I know whether the cat is on the mat! \n\n\nand question (43) is to be understood as imperative (44):\n\n (43) When does the\nmeeting begin? \n (44) Bring it about\nthat I know when the meeting begins! \n\n4.2 Wh-complements as meaningful units\n\nIf a wh-complement is part of a longer sentence, then what is its\ncontribution to the semantic value of that sentence? Formal semantic\ntheories of wh-complements can be organized around answers to this\nquestion.\n\nOne option (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1982) is to take a wh-complement\nto denote a proposition, just like a that-complement. A second option\n(Karttunen 1977) is to take wh-complements to denote sets of\npropositions. In either case, John\u2019s knowing who walks consists\nin the obtaining of a relation between John and the denotation of the\nexpression \u2018who walks\u2019. On the view that wh-complements\ndenote single propositions, wh-complements and that-complements are\ntreated uniformly, and Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982) contend that\nthis uniform treatment is a virtue of their theory. Lewis (1982)\nfavors the same sort of account, but he applies it only to\nwhether-complements. Theiler et al. (2018) propose a uniform\nanalysis of that- and wh-complements in the inquisitive semantics\nframework, overcoming certain limitations of Groenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s\npartition semantics.\n\nKarttunen, a proponent of the second option, takes wh-complements to\ndenote sets of true propositions, so that \u2018what John\nreads\u2019 denotes (Karttunen 1977, 20) \u201ca set which contains,\nfor each thing that John reads, the proposition that he reads\nit.\u201d On Groenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s account, by contrast,\n\u2018what John reads\u2019 denotes the proposition that is true in\na possible world if and only if the set of things that John reads in\nthat world equals the set of things John in fact reads. That is,\n\u2018what John reads\u2019 denotes a proposition that entails for\neach thing John reads that he reads it and for each thing John does\nnot read that he does not read it. Thus if one knows what John reads,\nit follows on Groenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s account (but not on\nKarttunen\u2019s) that one knows what John does not read. Also, on\nGroenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s account, the difference between\nknowing-that and knowing-wh amounts to a difference in what we might\ncall the rigidity of the complement. Consider the claim that\nI know that John reads Moby Dick and the claim that I know\nwhat John reads. The term \u2018that John reads Moby Dick\n\u2019 refers to the same proposition at every possible world; the\nterm \u2018what John reads\u2019 refers to different propositions at\nworlds at which John reads different things (and refers to the\nproposition that John reads Moby Dick at those worlds at\nwhich Moby Dick is the one and only thing that John reads).\n\n4.3 Wh-complements contextually defined\n\nIf wh-complements are not meaningful units of the sentences in which\nthey occur, one option is to interpret wh-complements\n\u201ccontextually\u201d, as Russell interpreted definite\ndescriptions. Indeed, Hintikka (1976, Chapter 4) argues that\nknowledge-wh sentences like (37)-(39) are ambiguous between two\nreadings: a universal reading and an existential reading. In the case\nof (37), Hintikka\u2019s two readings are as follows: \n\n (45)  a.\n\\(\\exists x(x\\) is in\nthe closet & John knows that \\(x\\) is in the closet)\n \n   b.\n\\(\\forall x(x\\) is in\nthe closet \\(\\rightarrow\\) John knows that \\(x\\) is in the\ncloset)  \n\n\nKarttunen (1977, 7) disputes the existence of Hintikka\u2019s\nambiguity, but a version of this ambiguity that sets aside the details\nof Hintikka\u2019s analysis of (37) has gained acceptance, namely,\nthe distinction between mention-some and mention-all\nreadings of a question or wh-complement. For example, under a\nmention-some reading of \u2018What is in the closet?\u2019, an\nanswer must mention at least one item, whereas under a mention-all\nreading an answer must mention all items. A perhaps clearer example of\na question for which a mention-some reading is natural is (51), which\nis discussed below in section\n 4.7\n in connection with false-belief sensitivity.\n4.4 Information provision versus contextualism\n\nBraun (2006) offers a very different account of knowledge-wh on which\nthe question-answer relationship underlying knowledge-wh is much less\nformal, and this makes it very easy to have knowledge-wh on\nBraun\u2019s account.\n\nConsider this example:\n\n (46) Who is Hong Oak\nYun? \n\n\nExamples like (46) are identity questions, which seem\nintuitively to call for a dimension of context-dependence that\nstandard theories of the question-answer relationship do not\naccommodate. The idea is that different ways of identifying Hong Oak\nYun are relevant in different contexts; accordingly, different\npropositions count as answers (or as correct answers) to (46) in\ndifferent contexts. Aloni (2005) provides a recent example of a theory\ndesigned to accommodate this idea.\n\nBraun (2006), however, rejects the idea entirely. According to\nBraun\u2019s (2006, 26) information provision account of\nquestions, \u201cto answer a question is simply to provide\ninformation about the subject matter of the question.\u201d That is,\n(46) is answered by any proposition that provides information about\nHong Oak Yun, even the proposition expressed by \u2018Hong Oak Yun is\na person who is over three inches tall\u2019. This answer may not\nsatisfy or be useful to or be informative for the speaker who poses\n(46), but it counts as an answer despite these purely pragmatic\nfailings, according to Braun\u2019s theory. To know who Hong Oak\nYun is, according to Braun, is simply to know the truth of a\nproposition that answers (46), which is to say, to know the truth of\nany proposition that provides information about Hong Oak Yun.\nBraun\u2019s view contrasts with the contextualism of Bo\u00ebr and\nLycan (1986) according to which knowing who Hong Oak Yun is requires\nknowing a proposition that provides contextually relevant information\nabout Hong Oak Yun. Another contextualist alternative to Braun\u2019s\nview is the view of Masto (2010), according to which (46) denotes a\ncontextually determined set of possible answers, and knowing who Hong\nOak Yun is consists in being able to choose or recognize the correct\nanswer from that contextually determined set.\n4.5 Question-relativity\n\nWhere Bo\u00ebr and Lycan view knowing-wh as context-relative,\nSchaffer (2007) views it as question-relative. The problem, according\nto Schaffer, is that if knowledge-wh is reduced to knowledge-that and\nis not question-relative, then cases of knowledge-wh that should be\ndistinguished will not be distinguished. Schaffer calls this the\nProblem of Convergent Knowledge. For example, suppose that (47) is\ntrue:\n\n (47) John knows that\nthe cat is on the mat. \n\n\nOn a non-question-relative account of knowledge-wh that reduces\nknowledge-wh to knowledge-that, all three of the following will be\nequivalent because all three can be reduced to (47): \n\n (48)  a.\nJohn knows whether the\ncat is on the mat or in the garage.  \n   b.\nJohn knows where the cat\nis.  \n   c.\nJohn knows what is on\nthe mat.  \n\n\nSchaffer argues that sentences like (48a\u2013c) are not equivalent.\nAccording to Schaffer\u2019s account, assuming the cat is indeed on\nthe mat, to know where the cat is is to know that the cat is on the\nmat relative to the question \u2018Where is the cat?\u2019, whereas\nto know what is on the mat is to know that the cat is on the mat\nrelative to the question \u2018What is on the mat?\u2019. Schaffer\nargues, in the end, that all knowledge, including knowledge-that, is\nquestion-relative. Aloni and \u00c9gr\u00e9 (2010) offer a\ndifferent take on Schaffer\u2019s Problem of Convergent Knowledge,\narguing that it reveals a pragmatic ambiguity concerning what it means\nto know the answer to a wh-question. \n4.6 Wh-complements as predicates\n\nBrogaard (2009) rejects both reductionist views (which, like\nHintikka\u2019s, reduce knowledge-wh to knowledge-that) and\nanti-reductionist views (which, like Schaffer\u2019s, analyze\nknowledge-wh as question-relative knowledge-that), arguing instead\nthat wh-complements are predicates and knowledge-wh is a special kind\nof de re knowledge. For example, on Brogaard\u2019s view, the logical\nform of (48c) is:\n\n(49) \\(\\exists x\\)\n(John knows that \\(x\\) is what is on the mat) \n\n\nA disadvantage of Brogaard\u2019s de re approach, Masto (2016)\nargues, is that the de re approach does not generalize to certain\nother attitude verbs that take wh-clauses as complements. For example,\nthere is no de re reading of (50):\n\n(50) John wonders what\nis on the mat.\n\n\nThat is, (50) cannot be read as meaning that there is a particular x\nabout which John has some relevant de re attitude of wonder. Part of\nthe problem is that whereas \u2018know\u2019 takes both\npropositional and interrogative complements, \u2018wonder\u2019\ntakes interrogative complements but not propositional complements.\nThis difference between \u2018know\u2019 and \u2018wonder\u2019 is\nthe distinction between responsive and rogative predicates, which will\nbe discussed in detail in section\n 4.8,\n below.\n4.7 False-belief sensitivity\n\nAnother basis for rejecting the reducibility of knowledge-wh to\nknowledge-that is the view that knowledge-wh is sensitive to false\nbeliefs. On this view, it is possible for there to be two subjects who\nknow the truth of exactly the same answer-propositions but exhibit a\ndifference in knowledge-wh because one subject has a false belief that\nthe other subject lacks. George (2013) argues for this possibility\nusing an example in which there are two shops: Newstopia and\nPaperWorld. Newstopia sells newspapers, including ones from Italy,\nwhereas PaperWorld is a stationery shop and does not sell newspapers.\nConsider the following question:\n\n (51) Where can one buy\nan Italian newspaper? \n\n\n(51) is to be read as a \u201cmention-some\u201d question, so that a\nless-than-exhaustive answer is considered appropriate. That is, to\nanswer (51) it suffices to name one place where one can buy an Italian\nnewspaper. Suppose, next, that the epistemic and doxastic states of\ntwo individuals, Janna and Rupert, are as follows:\n\n (52)  a.\nJanna and Rupert know\nthat one can buy an Italian newspaper at Newstopia. \n\n   b.\nRupert believes\n(falsely) that one can buy an Italian newspaper at PaperWorld. \n \n   c.\nNeither Rupert nor Janna\nhas any other beliefs or knowledge concerning the availability of\nItalian newspapers.  \n\n\nIn the scenario described in (52), George (2013) argues, we can fix\nthe relevant contextual parameters and standards governing\nknowledge-wh in such a way that (53a) is true, yet, relative to the\nsame contextual parameters and standards, (53b) is false, and its\nfalsity is a consequence of Rupert\u2019s false belief about\nPaperWorld:\n\n (53)  a.\nJanna knows where one\ncan buy an Italian newspaper.  \n   b.\nRupert knows where one\ncan buy an Italian newspaper.  \n\n\nThe difference between Janna and Rupert can be described this way:\nwhereas Janna knows the truth of each answer to (51) that she\nbelieves, the same cannot be said of Rupert.\n\nPhillips and George (2018) present experimental empirical evidence\nsupporting the false-belief sensitivity of knowledge-wh. There is also\na substantial discussion of false-belief sensitivity in Theiler et\nal. 2018, where it is referred to as false answer\nsensitivity.\n4.8 Responsive, rogative, and anti-rogative predicates\n\nKnowledge is only one of a broader category of attitudes corresponding\nto what Lahiri (2002) calls responsive predicates. It is\ncharacteristic of responsive predicates that they accept both\ninterrogative and declarative complements, as in \u2018Mary\nknows/remembers/forgets who runs\u2019 and \u2018Mary\nknows/remembers/forgets that John runs\u2019. Responsive predicates\ncontrast with what Lahiri (2002) calls rogative predicates,\nsuch as \u2018wonder\u2019, \u2018be curious\u2019, and\n\u2018inquire\u2019, and with what Theiler et al. (2019)\ncall anti-rogative predicates, such as \u2018suspect\u2019\nand \u2018hope\u2019. Rogative predicates accept interrogative\ncomplements but do not accept declarative complements. For example,\none can inquire who ate the last doughnut, but one cannot inquire that\nJohn ate the last doughnut. Anti-rogative predicates on the other\nhand, accept declarative complements but not interrogative\ncomplements. For instance, one can suspect that John ate the last\ndoughnut but one cannot suspect who ate the last doughnut. \n\nThe distinction between rogative and responsive predicates has\nepistemological significance, as it underlies Friedman\u2019s (2013)\nargument that there is a category of attitudes that have\nquestions, not propositions, as their contents. Friedman\ncalls these the interrogative attitudes, and they are\nprecisely the attitudes denoted by rogative predicates. \n\nWithin the category of responsive predicates Lahiri (2002, 287)\ndistinguishes the veridical from the non-veridical.\nVeridical-responsive predicates include \u2018know\u2019,\n\u2018remember\u2019, and \u2018forget\u2019;\nnon-veridical-responsive predicates include \u2018be certain\u2019,\n\u2018agree (about)\u2019, and \u2018conjecture (about)\u2019.\nWhereas a veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to the\ncorrect answer to its interrogative complement, a\nnon-veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to a possible\n(but not necessarily the correct) answer. For example, \u2018Jane\nremembers who won the lottery\u2019 entails that Jane has knowledge\nthat correctly answers the question \u2018Who won the\nlottery?\u2019, whereas \u2018Jane is certain about who won the\nlottery\u2019 entails that Jane is certain of the truth of a\nproposition that may or may not correctly answer that same question.\n\n\nRecent work in formal semantics has attempted to derive the fact that\nrogative predicates do not accept declarative complements and the fact\nthat anti-rogative predicates do not accept interrogative complements\nfrom independently observable semantic properties of such predicates\n(see, e.g., Theiler et al. 2019, Uegaki 2019, Roelofsen\n2019). \n4.9 Pointers to further reading\n\nA detailed uniform treatment of declarative and interrogative\ncomplements of responsive predicates in the context of inquisitive\nsemantics can be found in Theiler et al. 2018. On this\ntheory, declarative and interrogative complements are of the same\nsemantic type, which allows each responsive verb to have a single\nlexical entry.\n\nFor a detailed critique of the recent literature on knowledge-wh, see\nChapter 2 of Stanley 2011. Parent (2014) provides a survey of the\nrecent literature about knowledge-wh organized around three issues:\nthe reducibility of knowledge-wh to knowledge-that, the relativity of\nknowledge-wh to a contrast proposition, and the issue of whether the\ncontext-sensitivity of knowing-wh is to be understood as a semantic or\na pragmatic phenomenon. Uegaki (2019) provides an overview of recent\nwork on the semantics of responsive predicates generally and is\norganized around four approaches: the reduction of questions to\npropositions, the reduction of propositions to questions, the\nuniformity approach (on which declarative and interrogative\ncomplements of a responsive predicate are of the same semantic type),\nand the ambiguity approach (which postulates distinct\nproposition-taking and question-taking readings of a given responsive\npredicate). \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aloni, M., 2005, \u201cA Formal Treatment of the Pragmatics of\nQuestions and Attitudes\u201d, <em>Linguistics and Philosophy</em>,\n28 (5): 505\u2013539.", "Aloni, M., D.
