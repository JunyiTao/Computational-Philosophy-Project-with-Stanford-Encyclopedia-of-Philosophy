    "main_text": "\n\nAugust W. Schlegel (Sept. 5, 1767, Hanover \u2013 May 12, 1845, Bonn)\nwas a German essayist, critic, translator, philosopher, and poet.\nAlthough the philosophical dimension and profundity of his writings\nremain underrated, he is considered to be one of the founders of the\nGerman Romantic Movement\u2014which he conceived of as a European\nmovement\u2014as well as one of the most prominent disseminators of\nits philosophical foundational ideas, not only in Germany but also\nabroad and, most notably, in Britain.\n\nSchlegel had an outstanding knowledge of art, history, literature,\narchitecture, anthropology, and foreign languages, which made him a\ndecisive figure in the early development of comparative literature\n(cf. Craig 2000: 864) and modern linguistics, and with the creation of\nthe journal Indische Bibliothek, he inaugurated the domain of\nSanskrit studies in Germany. He also wrote poetry and drama; but he is\nmostly known for his critical writings and his brilliant translations\ninto German of Shakespeare, which are still used today.\n",
