    "main_text": "Naked Statistical Evidence || Blue Bus, Gatecrasher, Prisoner\n6.1 Blue Bus, Gatecrasher, Prisoner\n\n\nBlue Bus (Tribe 1971). Mrs. Brown is run down by a bus. It is\ncommon knowledge that 80% of the buses in town are owned by Blue Bus,\nand the remaining 20% by Red Bus. There was no witness to the accident\nexcept Brown who is, however, color-blind. Since Blue Bus owns 80% of\nthe buses in town, it is 80% likely that Brown was run down by a bus\noperated by Blue Bus, well above the 50% threshold for civil\nliability. Yet, merely presenting the 80% naked statistics should not\nbe sufficient for Brown to prevail in a civil lawsuit against Blue\nBus.\n\nGatecrasher (Cohen 1977). It is known that 499 people paid\nfor admission to a rodeo, but the total number of spectators was 1000.\nSuppose no paper tickets were issued and no witness could identify\nthose who paid. For any spectator picked at random, it is more than\n50% likely that they did not pay for admission. But even if this\nprobability is above the .5 threshold for civil liability, it would be\nodd that the rodeo organizers could win a lawsuit against any of the\nspectators simply by presenting the 449-out-of-1000 naked statistics.\n\nPrisoner (Nesson 1979). 100 prisoners are exercising in a\nprison yard. Suddenly 99 of them attack and kill the only guard on\nduty. One prisoner played no role whatsoever in the assault. These are\nthe undisputed facts in the case, and there is no further information\nabout what happened. If a prisoner is picked at random, his\nprobability of guilt would be as high as .99. Yet the intuition is\nthat this cannot be enough to establish guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n\n\nThese scenarios are like lottery cases in which the probability of a\nproposition such as \u201cmy ticket is a loser\u201d is high, yet\nintuitively the proposition cannot count as knowledge (see, e.g.,\nHarman 1968; Ebert, Smith, and Durbach 2018; Hawthorne 2004; Lawlor\n2013; Nelkin 2000). The evidence in these scenarios\u2014in\nparticular, Gatecrasher and Prisoner\u2014does not\nsingle out an individual specifically, but applies to any member of a\ngroup. Just as in lottery cases any ticket is very likely to lose,\nanyone who attended the rodeo or any prisoner in the yard is very\nlikely to be liable. In this sense, naked statistical evidence is\nsometimes contrasted with individualized or case-specific evidence\nsuch as trace evidence or eyewitness testimony (Colyvan, Regan, and\nFerson 2001; Stein 2005; Thomson 1986; Williams 1979). The distinction is\ncontested, however. Any form of evidence, after all, relies on a\ncategorization that places the defendant in a class with others, being\nthe class of those who have such-and-such facial features or were in\nsuch-and-such a place (Harcourt 2006; Saks and Kidd 1980; Schauer\n2003; Schoeman 1987; Wright 1988). Tillers (1997, 2005) notes that it\nis not always objectionable to base inferences about the behavior of\nan individual on the behavior of others, for example, membership in a\ngang or in the Ku Klux Klan can be indicative of someone\u2019s\nbeliefs.\n\nStill, there is intuitive resistance against verdicts of liability\nbased on naked statistics, but this resistance is less pronounced for\nverdicts based on more traditional forms of evidence, such as trace or\neyewitness testimony. The asymmetry might just be an artifact of\nhistory, since the testimony of an honest witness has been the bedrock\nof the Anglo-American trial system. However, the resistance toward\nnaked statistical evidence along with the preference for other forms\nof evidence has also been verified empirically (Arkes,\nShoots-Reinhard, and Mayes 2012; Niedermeier, Kerr, and\nMess\u00e9 1999; Wells 1992) and is not limited to the legal context\n(Ebert et al. 2018; Friedman and Turri 2015; Sykes and Johnson\n1999).\n\nSome scholars have expressed reservations about the relevance of\nhypothetical scenarios featuring naked statistical evidence. Since\nthese scenarios are removed from trial practice, they might be an\nunreliable guide for theorizing about the trial (Allen and Leiter\n2001; Dant 1988; Schmalbeck 1986). These scenarios, however, are\npartly modeled on real cases. For example, Blue Bus is\nmodeled on Smith v. Rapid Transit, Inc. 317\nMas. 469 (1945). The hypothetical also bears a similarity with\nthe landmark case Sindell v. Abbott\nLaboratories, 26 Cal. 3d 588 (1980) in which different\ncompanies marketed the same drug that was later shown to have caused\ncancer to a particular individual. Since the drug was sold by multiple\ncompanies, it was impossible to determine which company was\nresponsible. Statistics about the market share of the two companies\nwere used to attribute liability in absence of better, more\nindividualized evidence.\n",
