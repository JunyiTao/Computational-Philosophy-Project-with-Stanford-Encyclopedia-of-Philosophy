    "main_text": "Support for EC: Apparently Inconsistent Knowledge Claims, Skeptical and Everyday || Everyday Cases\n3.4 Everyday Cases\nWhile contextualists have claimed that their view promises a novel and appealing resolution of skeptical puzzles like SA, they have also emphasized what they regard as EC\u2019s consonance with our ordinary \u201cknowledge\u201d-attributing practices. There too, they say, we find evidence of the same context-sensitivity which skeptical arguments exploit. As Hookway puts the general claim: \u201cWhether I can correctly claim knowledge appears to be relative to the purposes underlying the conversations to which I am contributing\u201d (1996, 1).\nFor a couple of reasons, it is very important not to overlook the appeal to everyday cases. First, as we will see, a number of philosophers have questioned how effective EC is in its response to skepticism. If they are right, it matters a great deal that the effectiveness of that response is not EC\u2019s sole basis. Second, as Keith DeRose says, \u201cthe contextualist\u2019s appeal to varying standards for knowledge in his solution to skepticism would rightly seem unmotivated and ad hoc if we didn\u2019t have independent reason from non-philosophical talk to think such shifts in the content of knowledge attributions occur\u201d (2002, 169). But in fact, DeRose says, \u201c[t]he best grounds for accepting contextualism concerning knowledge attributions come from how knowledge-attributing (and knowledge-denying) sentences are used in ordinary, non-philosophical talk: What ordinary speakers will count as \u2018knowledge\u2019 in some non-philosophical contexts they will deny is such in others\u201d (2005, 172; 2006, 316; 2009, 47). Likewise, Cohen claims that examples such as the following \u201cstrongly [suggest] that ascriptions of knowledge are context-sensitive\u201d (1999, 59):[11]\nMary and John are at the L.A. airport contemplating taking a certain flight to New York. They want to know whether the flight has a layover in Chicago. They overhear someone ask a passenger Smith if he knows whether the flight stops in Chicago. Smith looks at the flight itinerary he got from the travel agent and respond, \u2018Yes I know\u2014it does stop in Chicago.\u2019 It turns out that Mary and John have a very important business contact they have to make at the Chicago airport. Mary says, \u2018How reliable is that itinerary? It could contain a misprint. They could have changed the schedule at the last minute.\u2019 Mary and John agree that Smith doesn\u2019t really know that the plane will stop in Chicago. They decide to check with the airline agent. (Ibid., 58)\nOnce again, contextualists claim that regarding the truth conditions of sentences using \u2018know\u2019 as context-dependent makes best sense of the flexibility in our \u201cknowledge\u201d-attributing behaviour. While, as we have seen, different specific versions of EC are possible, contextualists tend to agree that, in everyday cases, such as that just described, the increased practical importance of the subjects\u2019 \u201cgetting it right\u201d tends to raise the standards for the truth of a sentence of the form \u2018S knows that p\u2019. (Keep in mind, though, a point stressed in Section 2: namely, that just what an utterance of such a sentence expresses changes, in the \u2018high stakes\u2019 case, to some more demanding proposition\u2014we do not have a fixed such proposition, with different standards for its truth applying in the more demanding context.) The result is that the \u201cknowledge\u201d denial (Mary and John\u2019s claim) in the high-stakes situation may be true, without affecting the truth of the low stakes claim to \u201cknow\u201d (by Smith himself). What reason is there, though, for adopting this way of resolving the apparent incompatibility between the two \u2018knowledge\u2019 utterances?\nWell, it is important that the low-stakes claim be true, since that preserves our intuitive anti-skepticism: if you cannot know on the basis of ordinary, non-entailing evidence such as what is printed in the flight itinerary, we will have to deny very many of our ordinary claims to \u201cknow\u201d (Ibid., 59). But, it is argued, the \u2018high stakes\u2019 denial seems right too\u2014that is why the relevant (paired) cases constitute a puzzle. And EC allows us to preserve the sense that in such cases each of the two speakers is speaking \u2018properly\u2019, and \u201cthe presumption that what is properly said is true\u201d (DeRose 2005, 181). Whereas, if we take John and Mary\u2019s stricter standard to be too demanding\u2014if their denial of \u201cknowledge\u201d to Smith is false\u2014then, not only must we reject the feeling that what they are saying is in some sense correct, but it is \u201chard to see how Mary and John should describe their situation\u201d:\nCertainly they are being prudent in refusing to rely on the itinerary. They have a very important meeting in Chicago. Yet if Smith knows on the basis of the itinerary that the flight stops in Chicago, what should they have said? \u2018Okay, Smith knows that the flight stops in Chicago, but still, we need to check further.\u2019 To my ear, it is hard to make sense of that claim. (Cohen 1999, 58\u20139)\nBut we can avoid having to make sense of such claims, and having to explain why we mistakenly thought that what Mary and John were saying was correct, if we accept EC: in everyday no less than skeptical contexts, the sentences used by someone in a \u2018high-stakes\u2019 context and by his/her \u2018low stakes\u2019 counterpart can both be true, since they are made in different contexts, and (in some cases anyway[12]) the propositions they express are not really conflicting after all.\nIn short, contextualism promises to deliver up a nice symmetry between the flexibility in our (alleged) judgments as to the truth of a given \u201cknowledge\u201d claim/denial, and a parallel plasticity in the truth conditions (hence, the truth values) of the \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences we are prepared to assert. On the assumption that speakers realize, however tacitly, that what is expressed by an utterance of \u2018S knows (/doesn\u2019t know) that p\u2019 is a context-sensitive matter, this explains the aforementioned flexibility in our \u201cknowledge\u201d-attributing behavior.\n",
