    "main_text": "Liberty || Political Liberty\n4.3 Political Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s writings on religious and civil liberty are voluminous.\nMany are largely of historical interest, as they deal with issues of\nthe day, rather than broad principles.  The main claims of his social\nand political philosophy are briefly summarised in what follows.\n4.3.1 Religious Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s reasons for advocating complete freedom of religion are\nnumerous, but familiar. All religious tests for public office\nencourage persecution of the nonconformists as well as hypocrisy, by\ngiving incentives for outward subscription to something not believed.\nThey interfere with conscience, which is a private matter between an\nindividual and his deity. Above all, they hinder the great\nEnlightenment project of the onward march of reason and the\ndestruction of all forms of superstition. Toleration is insufficient,\nfor that implies that society recognizes one creed but tolerates\nothers. Full freedom should be extended to all religions, not just\ndifferent Christian denominations.\n4.3.2 Civil Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s political philosophy is, broadly speaking, in line with\nLocke\u2019s, but he follows it through to more radical conclusions.\nThe legitimacy of a government (though not of other hierarchical\ndistinctions) stems from the consent of the governed. Whereas in Locke\nthe people have a right to rebel only if there is a breach of the\nsocial contract, for Price they retain the right to alter their form\nof government as they wish. Direct democracy is the most desirable\nform of government, but in larger states democracy has perforce to be\nrepresentative. However, those elected are to be more delegates than\nrepresentatives, subject to instructions from their constituents (P\n25).\n\nIt is not clear how far Price thinks the franchise should be extended.\nThe logic of his position would seem to suggest universal suffrage,\nbut Price is no real advocate for it. He shares a common concern about\nthe qualifications of the uneducated and dependent to be voters.\nWriting of the election of British Members of Parliament before the\nGreat Reform Act of 1832, Price complains not only of the small size\nof the electorate, but also that voters are often drawn from the\n\u201cmeanest persons\u201d, the \u201clowest of the people\u201d.\nOne worry was that, insofar as they were dependent on landowners or\nemployers, their vote would not be genuinely independent.\nPrice appears never to have suggested extending the suffrage to women,\nperhaps because he thought them too ill educated and too dependent on\ntheir husbands or other male relatives. Price, unlike his friend\nWollstonecraft, appears never to have questioned the status quo in\nthis respect.\n\nCivil liberty, for Price, concerns the autonomy of a community or\nstate to make its own laws, free from outside interference. Important\nas this is, especially in the context of the American Revolution, it\nraises the question of what constitutes a distinct community or\nsociety. Does any dissident group constitute a community with the\nright to secede? This is an issue that has occasioned much violence\nand bloodshed, including the secession of the Southern States in 1860\nand, in our own day, Scottish, Basque, and Irish independence. The\nomission of a discussion of this seriously weakens his political\nphilosophy.\n\nOddly, Price does not include the liberty of the citizen as well as\nthe liberty of a country in his original definition of civil liberty.\nA country that governs itself can still be internally deeply\nrepressive. Price became aware of this deficiency, and expanded his\naccount in Additional Observations (P 76-100).\n\n\nA citizen is free when the power of commanding his own conduct and the\nquiet possession of his life, person, property and good name are\nsecured to him by being his own legislator \u2026 a government is\nfree when constituted in such a manner as to give this security. And\nthe freedom of a community or nation is the same among nations that\nthe freedom of a citizen is among his fellow-citizens. (P 82)\n\n\nThe best ways to secure a free government are the following:\n\n all parts of the state should be represented in the governing\nlegislature\n the representatives must be freely chosen by the electorate\n the representatives must be independent of any outside source of\npower\n they should be subject to frequent re-election\n they should be accountable to their constituents in all their\nacts\n\n\nThese proposals may now appear fairly modest, but few societies match\nup to them. For example, the power of corporate owners and lobbyists\nin funding elections in the United States breaches clause 3. The\nexistence of dependent territories, such as Puerto Rico, breaches\nclause 1. The existence of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom\nbreaches clauses 2 and 4. Revolutionary for the time, Price\u2019s\nsuggestions remain radical even today.\n5. Influence\n\nAlthough Price was influential in his lifetime in many areas, that\ninfluence soon waned, and few of his works were reprinted after his\ndeath. His immediate impact on discussion of the events surrounding\nthe American and French revolutions was large, but naturally faded as\nthose upheavals slipped into history. He died before the excesses of\nthe French revolution, which had been predicted by Burke. As a result\nof the success of his predictions, Burke acquired an immense\nreputation, while Price\u2019s was eclipsed. There is no doubt that\nPrice, along with others in the \u201cAge of Reason\u201d,\nexaggerated the degree to which people would pay attention to rational\nprinciples and reasonable solutions. There seems little to suggest\nthat his writings had a long-term impact on political philosophy.\nNevertheless, liberal-democratic societies have embraced many of\nPrice\u2019s causes; in that sense, in the longer term, Price could\nbe seen as being on the side of history after all.\n\nHis influence on the Unitarian movement also faded. His version of\nArianism, in which Christ was seen as having most of the supernatural\nattributes of the second person of the Trinity without actually being\nGod, gave way to the Socinian view, championed by Priestley, which\nstressed the straightforward humanity of Jesus. His reputation in\nactuarial work and demography suffered from his mistaken claim that\nthe British population was in decline. Even his beloved project of\nreducing or eliminating the national debt by means of a sinking fund\nfell out of favor.\n\nHis main legacy is, of course, in moral philosophy, but even here it\nis unclear how much direct influence he had. Some of the themes in\nA Review, especially issues to do with moral motivation and\nresponsibility, find distinct echoes in Kant, but that comes from\nsympathy of outlook, rather than influence. And Price\u2019s\nepistemology and metaphysics are wholly different from Kant\u2019s,\ndespite Hastings Rashdall\u2019s exaggerated claim that the\nReview \u201ccontains the gist of the Kantian doctrine\nwithout Kant\u2019s confusion\u201d (1907: 81 fn 1). The main\nfeatures of Price\u2019s epistemology, and his pluralism about moral\nprinciples, emerge again with the British Intuitionists who flourished\nin the first half of the twentieth century. While we know that C. D.\nBroad and Hastings Rashdall both rated Price very highly, \nthere is\nno direct evidence that Prichard, or even Ross (whose views most closely\nresemble Price\u2019s) had read him, though it seems likely they\ndid.\n\nInterest in Price was to some degree revived by books by Roland Thomas\n(1924), Carl Cone (1952), Lennart \u00c5qvist (1960), D. O. Thomas\n(1977), and W. D. Hudson (1970). Since then there has been a steady\ntrickle of articles on aspects of Price\u2019s work, but no real\ngroundswell of interest, despite another revival in the fortunes of\nIntuitionism towards the end of the twentieth century. In 1977 the\nPrice-Priestley Newsletter was founded; it morphed later into\nEnlightenment and Dissent, which ceased publication in 2016.\nHowever, resources for the study of Price have been greatly enhanced\nby the untiring work of D. O. Thomas who not only edited Price\u2019s\npolitical writings but, together with Bernard Peach, produced a\ncomplete edition of Price\u2019s correspondence.",
