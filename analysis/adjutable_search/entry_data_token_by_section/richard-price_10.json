    "main_text": "Liberty || Free will, rationality, and moral agency\n4.1 Free will, rationality, and moral agency\n\nPrice distinguishes, in a way that anticipates Kant, two ways in which\nmy action may be free: the first, physical liberty, is freedom to\nchoose; the second is moral autonomy. Freedom of choice is required\nfor agency and hence for moral responsibility. But that freedom allows\nus to act wrongly as well as rightly, to be irrational as well as\nrational, to go astray as well as to go aright. When we go astray,\nPrice contends, by doing something we know we shouldn\u2019t, we feel\nourselves unfree, in that we have lost control. We lack self-mastery\nor moral autonomy: we have succumbed to temptation, instead of obeying\nthe moral law. As with Kant, moral autonomy is the triumph of both\nrationality and morality over countervailing desires, since we always\nhave most reason to fulfill our moral obligations. Price contends\nalso, in good Platonic fashion, that when we follow virtue we do what\nwe (really) want. It is fairly common to distinguish those parts of\none\u2019s personality with which one identifies, and that are taken\nto be its central core, and those impulses that are seen as external,\nalien, or even threatening. The metaphor of addiction or enslavement\nis virtually irresistible in explaining this distinction: we are under\nattack by passions which can take control of us if we are not careful,\nso that we no longer do what we want to do, but what these\nalien forces or siren voices tempt us to do. If we give in too often\nwe will have lost the battle and our autonomy; we will no longer be in\ncharge of our own lives, but succumb to what we reject, and even hate.\nSome philosophers hold that the agent has considerable choice in\ndetermining which parts of her personality are central and which\nperipheral. Price claims, however, that the central core of our\nidentity is metaphysically fixed.\n\n\n[What] is most properly a man\u2019s self \u2026 is\n\u2026 not his passions, but his reason or his judgment, prescribing\nwhat is right, and prohibiting what is wrong. The conscience of a man\nis the man; the reflecting principle is our supreme principle. It is\nwhat gives our distinction as intelligent creatures; and whenever we\nact contrary to it, we violate our natures, and are at variance with\nourselves. (Price 1816: 208, quoted in D.\nO. Thomas 1977: 170)\n\n\nIn short, physical liberty is a necessary condition of the capacity to\ndirect one\u2019s actions at all; moral liberty is exercising that\nagency to direct one\u2019s actions as normative reality\nrequires.\n",
