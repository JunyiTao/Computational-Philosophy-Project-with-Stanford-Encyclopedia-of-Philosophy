    "main_text": "Hermeneutical Foundations || Dialogue and Phronesis\n2.1 Dialogue and Phronesis\n\nGadamer\u2019s thinking began and always remained connected with\nGreek thought, especially that of Plato and Aristotle. In this\nrespect, Gadamer\u2019s early engagement with Plato, which lay at the\ncore of both his doctoral and habilitation dissertations, was\ndeterminative of much of the character and philosophical direction of\nhis thinking. Under the influence of his early teachers such as\nHartmann, as well as Friedlander, Gadamer developed an approach to\nPlato that rejected the idea of any \u2018hidden\u2019 doctrine in\nPlato\u2019s thought, looking instead to the structure of the\nPlatonic dialogues themselves as the key to understanding\nPlato\u2019s philosophy. The only way to understand Plato, as Gadamer\nsaw it, was thus by working through the Platonic texts in a way that\nnot only enters into the dialogue and dialectic set out in those\ntexts, but also repeats that dialogic movement in the attempt at\nunderstanding as such. Moreover, the dialectical structure of Platonic\nquestioning also provides the model for a way of understanding that is\nopen to the matter at issue through bringing oneself into question\nalong with the matter itself.\n\nUnder the influence of Heidegger, Gadamer also took up, as a central\nelement in his thinking, the idea of phronesis\n(\u2018practical wisdom\u2019) that appears in Book VI of\nAristotle\u2019s Nichomachean Ethics. For Heidegger the\nconcept of phronesis is important, not only as a means of\ngiving emphasis to our practical \u2018being-in-the world\u2019 over\nand against theoretical apprehension, but also as constituting a mode\nof insight into our own concrete situation (both our practical\nsituation and, more fundamentally, our existential situation, hence\nphronesis constitutes a mode of self-knowledge). The\nway in which Gadamer conceives of understanding, and interpretation,\nis as just such a practically oriented mode of insight\u2014a mode of\ninsight that has its own rationality irreducible to any simple rule or\nset of rules, that cannot be directly taught, that necessarily\nimplicates an understanding of self as well as other, and that is\nalways oriented to the particular case at hand. The concept of\nphronesis can itself be seen as providing a certain\nelaboration of the dialogic conception of understanding Gadamer had\nalready found in Plato, but it goes well beyond the Platonic account\nalone.\n\nTaken together, phronesis and dialogue provide the essential\nstarting point for the development of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics. It is a starting point in which these two key elements,\nphronesis and dialogue, can be seen as together founded in,\nas well as being elaborative of, the idea of hermeneutical situation\nor situatedness\u2014an idea that has a Heideggerian provenance, but\nwhich Gadamer also develops in his own terms. The idea of\nhermeneutical situation is basic to Gadamer\u2019s approach and underpins\nmany of his key concepts even though it often remains in the\nbackground. It is elaborated, sometimes implicitly, through notions of\nevent and encounter, and in a way that increasingly draws attention to\nthe role of the other (although the self-other relation figures\nthroughout Gadamer\u2019s thinking, see Dallmayr, 1993). It is an idea tied\nto Gadamer\u2019s use of the notion of play as a key element in\nunderstanding and to the character of understanding as always embedded\nin an prior \u2018horizon\u2019 that is also fundamentally\nhistorical.Phronesis and dialogue are thus aspects of a\nhermeneutical situatedness that is complex,\ndifferentiated, and dynamic.\n",
