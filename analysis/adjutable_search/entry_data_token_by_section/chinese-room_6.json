    "main_text": "Replies to the Chinese Room Argument || The Systems Reply\n4.1 The Systems Reply\n\nIn the original BBS article, Searle identified and discussed several\nresponses to the argument that he had come across in giving the\nargument in talks at various places. As a result, these early\nresponses have received the most attention in subsequent discussion.\nWhat Searle 1980 calls \u201cperhaps the most common reply\u201d is\nthe Systems Reply.\n\nThe Systems Reply (which Searle says was originally associated with\nYale, the home of Schank\u2019s AI work) concedes that the man in the\nroom does not understand Chinese. But, the reply continues, the man is\nbut a part, a central processing unit (CPU), in a larger system. The\nlarger system includes the huge database, the memory (scratchpads)\ncontaining intermediate states, and the instructions \u2013 the\ncomplete system that is required for answering the Chinese questions.\nSo the Sytems Reply is that while the man running the program does not\nunderstand Chinese, the system as a whole does.\n\nNed Block was one of the first to press the Systems Reply, along with\nmany others including Jack Copeland, Daniel Dennett, Douglas\nHofstadter, Jerry Fodor, John Haugeland, Ray Kurzweil and Georges Rey.\nRey (1986) says the person in the room is just the CPU of the system.\nKurzweil (2002) says that the human being is just an implementer and\nof no significance (presumably meaning that the properties of the\nimplementer are not necessarily those of the system). Kurzweil hews to\nthe spirit of the Turing Test and holds that if the system displays\nthe apparent capacity to understand Chinese \u201cit would have to,\nindeed, understand Chinese\u201d \u2013 Searle is contradicting\nhimself in saying in effect, \u201cthe machine speaks Chinese but\ndoesn\u2019t understand Chinese\u201d.\n\nMargaret Boden (1988) raises levels considerations.\n\u201cComputational psychology does not credit the brain with seeing\nbean-sprouts or understanding English: intentional states such as\nthese are properties of people, not of brains\u201d (244). \u201cIn\nshort, Searle\u2019s description of the robot\u2019s pseudo-brain\n(that is, of Searle-in-the-robot) as understanding English involves a\ncategory-mistake comparable to treating the brain as the bearer, as\nopposed to the causal basis, of intelligence\u201d. Boden (1988)\npoints out that the room operator is a conscious agent, while the CPU\nin a computer is not \u2013 the Chinese Room scenario asks us to take\nthe perspective of the implementer, and not surprisingly fails to see\nthe larger picture.\n\nSearle\u2019s response to the Systems Reply is simple: in principle,\nhe could internalize the entire system, memorizing all the\ninstructions and the database, and doing all the calculations in his\nhead. He could then leave the room and wander outdoors, perhaps even\nconversing in Chinese. But he still would have no way to attach\n\u201cany meaning to the formal symbols\u201d. The man would now\nbe the entire system, yet he still would not understand\nChinese. For example, he would not know the meaning of the Chinese\nword for hamburger. He still cannot get semantics from syntax. \n\nIn some ways Searle\u2019s response here anticipates later extended\nmind views (e.g. Clark and Chalmers 1998): if Otto, who suffers loss\nof memory, can regain those recall abilities by externalizing some of\nthe information to his notebooks, then Searle arguably can do the\nreverse: by internalizing the instructions and notebooks he should\nacquire any abilities had by the extended system. And so Searle in\neffect concludes that since he doesn\u2019t acquire understanding of\nChinese by internalizing the external components of the entire system\n(e.g. he still doesn\u2019t know what the Chinese word for hamburger\nmeans), understanding was never there in the partially externalized\nsystem of the original Chinese Room.\n\nIn his 2002 paper \u201cThe Chinese Room from a Logical Point of\nView\u201d, Jack Copeland considers Searle\u2019s response to the\nSystems Reply and argues that a homunculus inside Searle\u2019s head\nmight understand even though the room operator himself does not, just\nas modules in minds solve tensor equations that enable us to catch\ncricket balls. Copeland then turns to consider the Chinese Gym, and\nagain appears to endorse the Systems Reply: \u201c\u2026the\nindividual players [do not] understand Chinese. But there is no\nentailment from this to the claim that the simulation as a whole does\nnot come to understand Chinese. The fallacy involved in moving from\npart to whole is even more glaring here than in the original version\nof the Chinese Room Argument\u201d. Copeland denies that\nconnectionism implies that a room of people can simulate the\nbrain.\n\nJohn Haugeland writes (2002) that Searle\u2019s response to the\nSystems Reply is flawed: \u201c\u2026what he now asks is what it\nwould be like if he, in his own mind, were consciously to implement\nthe underlying formal structures and operations that the theory says\nare sufficient to implement another mind\u201d. According to\nHaugeland, his failure to understand Chinese is irrelevant: he is just\nthe implementer. The larger system implemented would understand\n\u2013 there is a level-of-description fallacy.\n\nShaffer 2009 examines modal aspects of the logic of the CRA and argues\nthat familiar versions of the System Reply are question-begging. But,\nShaffer claims, a modalized version of the System Reply succeeds\nbecause there are possible worlds in which understanding is an\nemergent property of complex syntax manipulation. Nute 2011 is a reply\nto Shaffer.\n\nStevan Harnad has defended Searle\u2019s argument against Systems\nReply critics in two papers. In his 1989 paper, Harnad writes\n\u201cSearle formulates the problem as follows: Is the mind a\ncomputer program? Or, more specifically, if a computer program\nsimulates or imitates activities of ours that seem to require\nunderstanding (such as communicating in language), can the program\nitself be said to understand in so doing?\u201d (Note the specific\nclaim: the issue is taken to be whether the program itself\nunderstands.) Harnad concludes: \u201cOn the face of it, [the CR\nargument] looks valid. It certainly works against the most common\nrejoinder, the \u2018Systems Reply\u2019\u2026.\u201d Harnad\nappears to follow Searle in linking understanding and states of\nconsciousness: Harnad 2012 (Other Internet Resources) argues that\nSearle shows that the core problem of conscious \u201cfeeling\u201d\nrequires sensory connections to the real world. (See sections below\n\u201cThe Robot Reply\u201d and \u201cIntentionality\u201d for\ndiscussion.)\n\nFinally some have argued that even if the room operator memorizes the\nrules and does all the operations inside his head, the room operator\ndoes not become the system. Cole (1984) and Block (1998) both argue\nthat the result would not be identity of Searle with the system but\nmuch more like a case of multiple personality \u2013 distinct persons\nin a single head. The Chinese responding system would not be Searle,\nbut a sub-part of him. In the CR case, one person (Searle) is an\nEnglish monoglot and the other is a Chinese monoglot. The\nEnglish-speaking person\u2019s total unawareness of the meaning of\nthe Chinese responses does not show that they are not understood. This\nline, of distinct persons, leads to the Virtual Mind Reply. \n4.1.1 The Virtual Mind Reply\n\nThe Virtual Mind reply concedes, as does the System Reply, that the\noperator of the Chinese Room does not understand Chinese merely by\nrunning the paper machine. However the Virtual Mind reply holds that\nwhat is important is whether understanding is created, not whether the\nRoom operator is the agent that understands. Unlike the Systems Reply,\nthe Virtual Mind reply (VMR) holds that a running system may create\nnew, virtual, entities that are distinct from both the system as a\nwhole, as well as from the sub-systems such as the CPU or operator. In\nparticular, a running system might create a distinct agent that\nunderstands Chinese. This virtual agent would be distinct from both\nthe room operator and the entire system. The psychological traits,\nincluding linguistic abilities, of any mind created by artificial\nintelligence will depend entirely upon the program and the Chinese\ndatabase, and will not be identical with the psychological traits and\nabilities of a CPU or the operator of a paper machine, such as Searle\nin the Chinese Room scenario. According to the VMR the mistake in the\nChinese Room Argument is to make the claim of strong AI to be\n\u201cthe computer understands Chinese\u201d or \u201cthe System\nunderstands Chinese\u201d. The claim at issue for AI should simply be\nwhether \u201cthe running computer creates understanding of\nChinese\u201d.\n\nA familiar model of virtual agents are characters in computer or video\ngames, and personal digital assistants, such as Apple\u2019s Siri and\nMicrosoft\u2019s Cortana. These characters have various abilities and\npersonalities, and the characters are not identical with the system\nhardware or program that creates them. A single running system might\ncontrol two distinct agents, or physical robots, simultaneously, one\nof which converses only in Chinese and one of which can converse only\nin English, and which otherwise manifest very different personalities,\nmemories, and cognitive abilities. Thus the VM reply asks us to\ndistinguish between minds and their realizing systems. \n\nMinsky (1980) and Sloman and Croucher (1980) suggested a Virtual Mind\nreply when the Chinese Room argument first appeared. In his\nwidely-read 1989 paper \u201cComputation and Consciousness\u201d,\nTim Maudlin considers minimal physical systems that might implement a\ncomputational system running a program. His discussion revolves around\nhis imaginary Olympia machine, a system of buckets that transfers\nwater, implementing a Turing machine. Maudlin\u2019s main target is\nthe computationalists\u2019 claim that such a machine could have\nphenomenal consciousness. However in the course of his discussion,\nMaudlin considers the Chinese Room argument. Maudlin (citing Minsky,\nand Sloman and Croucher) points out a Virtual Mind reply that the\nagent that understands could be distinct from the physical system\n(414). Thus \u201cSearle has done nothing to discount the possibility\nof simultaneously existing disjoint mentalities\u201d\n(414\u20135).\n\nPerlis (1992), Chalmers (1996) and Block (2002) have apparently\nendorsed versions of a Virtual Mind reply as well, as has Richard\nHanley in The Metaphysics of Star Trek (1997). Penrose (2002)\nis a critic of this strategy, and Stevan Harnad scornfully dismisses\nsuch heroic resorts to metaphysics. Harnad defended Searle\u2019s\nposition in a \u201cVirtual Symposium on Virtual Minds\u201d (1992)\nagainst Patrick Hayes and Don Perlis. Perlis pressed a virtual minds\nargument derived, he says, from Maudlin. Chalmers (1996) notes that\nthe room operator is just a causal facilitator, a \u201cdemon\u201d,\nso that his states of consciousness are irrelevant to the properties\nof the system as a whole. Like Maudlin, Chalmers raises issues of\npersonal identity \u2013 we might regard the Chinese Room as\n\u201ctwo mental systems realized within the same physical space. The\norganization that gives rise to the Chinese experiences is quite\ndistinct from the organization that gives rise to the demon\u2019s [=\nroom operator\u2019s] experiences\u201d(326).\n\nCole (1991, 1994) develops the reply and argues as follows:\nSearle\u2019s argument requires that the agent of understanding be\nthe computer itself or, in the Chinese Room parallel, the person in\nthe room. However Searle\u2019s failure to understand Chinese in the\nroom does not show that there is no understanding being created. One\nof the key considerations is that in Searle\u2019s discussion the\nactual conversation with the Chinese Room is always seriously under\nspecified. Searle was considering Schank\u2019s programs, which can\nonly respond to a few questions about what happened in a restaurant,\nall in third person. But Searle wishes his conclusions to apply to any\nAI-produced responses, including those that would pass the toughest\nunrestricted Turing Test, i.e. they would be just the sort of\nconversations real people have with each other. If we flesh out the\nconversation in the original CR scenario to include questions in\nChinese such as \u201cHow tall are you?\u201d, \u201cWhere do you\nlive?\u201d, \u201cWhat did you have for breakfast?\u201d,\n\u201cWhat is your attitude toward Mao?\u201d, and so forth, it\nimmediately becomes clear that the answers in Chinese are not\nSearle\u2019s answers. Searle is not the author of the\nanswers, and his beliefs and desires, memories and personality traits\n(apart from his industriousness!) are not reflected in the answers and\nin general Searle\u2019s traits are causally inert in producing the\nanswers to the Chinese questions. This suggests the following\nconditional is true: if there is understanding of Chinese created by\nrunning the program, the mind understanding the Chinese would not be\nthe computer, whether the computer is human or electronic. The person\nunderstanding the Chinese would be a distinct person from the room\noperator, with beliefs and desires bestowed by the program and its\ndatabase. Hence Searle\u2019s failure to understand Chinese while\noperating the room does not show that understanding is not being\ncreated. \n\nCole (1991) offers an additional argument that the mind doing the\nunderstanding is neither the mind of the room operator nor the system\nconsisting of the operator and the program: running a suitably\nstructured computer program might produce answers submitted in Chinese\nand also answers to questions submitted in Korean. Yet the Chinese\nanswers might apparently display completely different knowledge and\nmemories, beliefs and desires than the answers to the Korean questions\n\u2013 along with a denial that the Chinese answerer knows any\nKorean, and vice versa. Thus the behavioral evidence would be that\nthere were two non-identical minds (one understanding Chinese only,\nand one understanding Korean only). Since these might have mutually\nexclusive properties, they cannot be identical, and ipso facto, cannot\nbe identical with the mind of the implementer in the room.\nAnalogously, a video game might include a character with one set of\ncognitive abilities (smart, understands Chinese) as well as another\ncharacter with an incompatible set (stupid, English monoglot). These\ninconsistent cognitive traits cannot be traits of the XBOX system that\nrealizes them. Cole argues that the implication is that minds\ngenerally are more abstract than the systems that realize them (see\nMind and Body in the Larger Philosophical Issues section).\n\nIn short, the Virtual Mind argument is that since the evidence that\nSearle provides that there is no understanding of Chinese was that\nhe wouldn\u2019t understand Chinese in the room, the Chinese\nRoom Argument cannot refute a differently formulated equally strong AI\nclaim, asserting the possibility of creating understanding using a\nprogrammed digital computer. Maudlin (1989) says that Searle has not\nadequately responded to this criticism.\n\nOthers however have replied to the VMR, including Stevan Harnad and\nmathematical physicist Roger Penrose. Penrose is generally sympathetic\nto the points Searle raises with the Chinese Room argument, and has\nargued against the Virtual Mind reply. Penrose does not believe that\ncomputational processes can account for consciousness, both on Chinese\nRoom grounds, as well as because of limitations on formal systems\nrevealed by Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness proof. (Penrose has\ntwo books on mind and consciousness; Chalmers and others have\nresponded to Penrose\u2019s appeals to G\u00f6del.) In his 2002\narticle \u201cConsciousness, Computation, and the Chinese Room\u201d\nthat specifically addresses the Chinese Room argument, Penrose argues\nthat the Chinese Gym variation \u2013 with a room expanded to the\nsize of India, with Indians doing the processing \u2013 shows it is\nvery implausible to hold there is \u201csome kind of disembodied\n\u2018understanding\u2019 associated with the person\u2019s\ncarrying out of that algorithm, and whose presence does not impinge in\nany way upon his own consciousness\u201d (230\u20131). Penrose\nconcludes the Chinese Room argument refutes Strong AI. Christian\nKaernbach (2005) reports that he subjected the virtual mind theory to\nan empirical test, with negative results.\n",
