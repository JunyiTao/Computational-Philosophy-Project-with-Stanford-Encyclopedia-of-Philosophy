    "main_text": "Theology and Theodicy\n10. Theology and Theodicy\n\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy is theocratic. God is a king, and the world\nis his kingdom. Ours is the best of all possible worlds, with respect\nto variety, order, location, place, time, efficiency, and \u201cthe\nmost power, knowledge, the greatest happiness and goodness in created\nthings\u201d (G 6: 603). For God can choose to realize any world he\nwishes, and it would be inconsistent with his goodness and power to\nrealize a world that is not as good as possible. Our world metes out\njustice for all in the hereafter and is constantly improving. The\n\u201ckingdom of nature,\u201d in which everything happens for\nmechanical reasons, is at the same time, a \u201ckingdom of\ngrace\u201d in which everything that happens exemplifies God\u2019s\nwisdom and justice (G 6:622). Yet, though Leibniz maintained\nfrequently that the order and regularity of nature hinted at or\npointed to a divine creative hand, and suggested that the existence of\nanything at all implied the existence of a necessary being (G 4: 106),\nhe produced only one actual argument for the existence of God. This\nwas a version of Anselm\u2019s ontological argument. Leibniz\nmaintained that God\u2019s existence could be deduced from the\nmaximal concept of God as the sum of all perfections, only if it was\nfirst demonstrated that God was a possible, not an impossible object.\nCertain maximal concepts, such as \u201cthe greatest speed\u201d\nare, he pointed out, fundamentally incoherent, and the term denotes\nnothing (G 4: 359\u201360). Leibniz saw nothing incoherent in the\nmaximal notion of \u201cthe most perfect being\u201d and concluded\nthat God existed. It was unclear however, why, so long as God is\npossible, the Ontological Argument survives the familiar criticisms of\nAquinas. The inference from possibility to necessity seems to depend\nless on the logic of concepts than on Leibniz\u2019s esoteric idea\nthat concepts, or possible objects, strive to come into existence with\na tendency to exist proportional to their perfection (G 7:303).\n\nKant criticized arguments for God\u2019s existence (presumably\nbrought to his attention through Wolff\u2019s Theologia\nNaturalis) that departed from the premise that the concept of God\nis noncontradictory as fallacious hyperrationalism. The Leibnizian\nargument rested, he thought, on the uncritical notion that every\nnoncontradictory concept was a possible thing (20:302), though it is\nunclear why he attacks this claim in particular. Kant did not think\nany rationalistic proofs for the existence of God actually worked,\nthough, at least before the mauling it received at the hands of Hume,\nhe considered the physico-theological argument the best available. He\nnoted perceptively the arbitrariness of merging into one theological\nidea a creator and a judge. Without revelation, we might be drawn to\nthe ideas of a creator God, but why would we suppose this same being\nto have the power of reward and punishment after death? Taking a page\nfrom Locke, Kant decided that, since the existence of God was\nunknowable, philosophical effort should be directed to the idea of\nGod, especially the separate functions that the idea of God plays in\nregulating our moral conduct ( judge concept) and our mode of address\nto the problems of form and function in the organic realm (creator\nconcept). The distinction between the realm of grace and the realm of\nnature, one standing under moral laws of reward and punishment, the\nother under natural laws, Kant describes as a \u201cpractically\nnecessary idea of reason\u201d (KRV A 812 f/B 840). We conceive the\nworld both as a community of active spirits, willing and representing,\nand as an aggregate of objects in mechanical interplay and shift\nperspectives as needed.\n\nPhysical and increasingly moral evil were topics much discussed in the\n18th century, and pessimism over the condition of the world,\nespecially its violence and suffering, was understood to be a tempting\nyet in some ways deplorable option.. As befit a celebrated optimist,\nLeibniz had a sanguine view of human beings. Most of us, he appeared\nto think, are morally decent people, and evil men are best dealt with\nby good laws and effective legal institutions. A good education and\nsome degree of censorship are also helpful. Posthumous divine\nretribution will take care of what human institutions cannot. Leibniz\nexplained the appearance of evil in the world as consistent with\nGod\u2019s goodness in various ways. He claimed that evil derives\nfrom the portion of inertia or nullity present in all non-divine\ncreation; that it is a necessary accompaniment of good, or a stimulus\nto action, that it is an illusion based on narrow or temporally\nlimited experience (G 4: 120f, 196, 231). Moreover, the world has not\ndeclined since the Fall, but, on the contrary, the entire universe\n\u201ctakes part in a perpetual and most free progress, so that it is\nalways advancing toward greater culture (cultivation)\u201d (G 7:\n308).\n\nTaken to ridiculous lengths by Wolff, Leibnizian optimism was targeted\nand satirized by Voltaire, who, however, took the problem of evil\nseriously. Kant as well was little inclined to make fun of evil and\nsuffering, and he viewed liberation from theology as a precondition of\nbetter morals and politics. There are both optimistic and pessimistic\nstrains in his philosophy. In his pre-critical writings, the Nova\nDilucidatio and the Essay on Some Considerations on\nOptimism, he seemed inclined towards the best of all possible\nworlds position, but in his critical period he denied that cosmic\njustice is an item of knowledge. The conviction that moral goodness\nnot only deserves reward but is rewarded is nevertheless an article of\nfaith and hope that sustains morality.\n",
