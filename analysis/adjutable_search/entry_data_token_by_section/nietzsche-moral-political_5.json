    "main_text": "Nietzsche\u2019s Metaethics || Privilege Readings\n3.1 Privilege Readings\n\nPrivilege Readings of Nietzsche come in two main varieties: Realist\nand Privilege Non-Realist (P-Non-Realist). The proponents of these\nviews would hold the following:\n\n\n(i) According to the Realist, there are normative facts.\n\n(ii) According to the P-Non-Realist, there are no normative facts, but\nsome normative judgments still enjoy a privilege by virtue of their\ninterpersonal appeal or acceptance.\n\n\nTo say that there are \u2018normative facts\u2019 will\nmean, for purposes here, that norms are (in some sense)\nobjective, i.e., mind- or attitude-independent features of\nthe world. Wilcox (1974), Schacht (1983) and Katsafanas (2013b), among\nmany others, have defended a Realist reading, while Foot (1973) has\ndefended a P-Non-Realist reading. We consider the difficulties\nafflicting these Privilege Readings in turn.\n\nRealist readings assign a special place to power (or will to power) in\nexplaining the objectivity of normative facts. On these views,\nNietzsche holds, first, that only power really has value and,\nsecond, that power is an objective, natural property.\nNietzsche\u2019s evaluative perspective is privileged, in turn,\nbecause it involves assessing (i) prudential value (value\nfor an agent) in terms of degree of power, and (ii)\nnon-prudential value in terms of maximization of prudential value\n(i.e., maximization of power). \n\nAccording to Schacht, for example, Nietzsche\u2019s account of\n\u201cthe fundamental character of life and the world\u201d as\nwill to power is supposed to \u201cground\u201d his own\nevaluative standpoint (1983: 348\u2013349). As Nietzsche writes (in a\npassage Schacht quotes): \u201cassuming that life itself is the will\nto power,\u201d then \u201cthere is nothing to life that has value,\nexcept the degree of power\u201d (WP 55). Nietzsche\u2019s\nrevaluation of values, then, assesses moral values on the basis of\ntheir \u201cdegree of power,\u201d something which constitutes an\n\u201cobjective measure of value\u201d (WP 674). Hence the privilege\nof his view: it embraces as an evaluative standard the only thing in\nlife that (in fact) has value (namely power), and employs this\n\u201cobjective measure of value\u201d in the revaluation (e.g., by\ncriticizing Christian morality because it does not maximize\n\u201cpower\u201d).\n\nWhat exactly is Nietzsche\u2019s argument on the N-Realist\nreading? Schacht writes:\n\nHuman life, for Nietzsche, is ultimately a part of a kind of vast\ngame\u2026[which] is, so to speak, the only game in town\u2026.The\nnature of the game, he holds, establishes a standard for the\nevaluation of everything falling within its compass. The availability\nof this standard places evaluation on footing that is as firm as that\non which the comprehension of life and the world stands. (1983, p.\n398)\n\n\nTalk of \u201cthe only game in town\u201d is far too metaphorical,\nhowever, to bear the philosophical weight demanded. From the fact that\n\u201clife itself is the will to power,\u201d how does it follow\nthat power is the only standard of value? From the fact, for\nexample, that all life obeys the laws of fundamental physics, nothing\nfollows about the appropriate standard of value. What Schacht and some\nothers seem to have in mind is something like John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nargument for utilitarianism, which proceeds from the premise that\nsince happiness is the only thing people desire or aim for, it follows\nthat happiness is the only thing that possesses intrinsic value. This\nargument, though, is famously unsuccessful: from the fact that only\nhappiness is desired, nothing at all follows about what\nought to be desired. Attempts to construe Nietzsche\u2019s\nargument in an analogous way encounter similar problems (Leiter 2000\nexplores the analogy in detail).\n\nOn Mill\u2019s well-known and oft-criticized \u2018proof\u2019 of\nthe principle of utility from his 1861 Utilitarianism, to\nshow that something is visible, we must show that it is seen; and to\nshow that something is audible, we must show that it is heard;\nanalogously,\n\n(P) to show that something is desirable (i.e., valuable), show that it\nis desired.\n\n\nMillian hedonism holds that only happiness or pleasure is\nintrinsically desirable or valuable (\u2018Prescriptive\nHedonism\u2019). Let us call \u2018Value Nihilism\u2019 the view\nthat there is nothing that has value or is valuable (or desirable). To\nget Prescriptive Hedonism from (P), then, plug in \u2018Descriptive\nHedonism\u2019 \u2014 the thesis that people do in fact desire\nonly pleasure as an end. If (P) is valid, Descriptive\nHedonism true, and Value Nihilism false, then the truth of\nPrescriptive Hedonism follows. ((P), of course, is not valid, a point\nto which we will return.)\n\nNotice, now, that the same type of argument seems to capture what the\nN-Realist construal of Nietzsche has in mind. That is, to get the\nN-Realist Nietzschean conclusion that what is valuable is power, take\n(P) and plug in a strong form of Nietzsche\u2019s descriptive\ndoctrine of the will to power \u2014 the doctrine, roughly, that all\npersons intrinsically \u2018desire\u2019 only power. If (P) is\nvalid, Value Nihilism false, and the descriptive doctrine of the will\nto power is true, then the normative conclusion about power, which\nSchacht is after, seems to follow. (Note, of course, that the Millian\nModel argument as formulated so far would show only that power is what\nis non-morally valuable or good for an agent. Of course, if the\nMillian Model argument for prudential value or non-moral goodness does\nnot work, then that provides a very strong (if defeasible)\nreason for supposing that there is no further argument for the related\naccount of non-prudential value as consisting in maximization of\npower.)\n\nWhat are the problems with this \u201cMillian argument\u201d? The\nfirst problem, of course, is that (P) is not valid. While from the\nfact that x is heard, it follows that x is audible,\nit does not follow from that fact that x is desired that\nx is desirable in the sense necessary for the\nargument. For while \u2018audible\u2019 can be fairly rendered\nas \u2018can be heard,\u2019 \u2018desirable,\u2019 in the context\nof Prescriptive Hedonism, means \u2018ought to be\ndesired\u2019 (not \u2018can\u2019 or \u2018is\u2019 desired).\nThus, while it follows that:\n\nIf x is heard, then x can be heard (\u2018is\naudible\u2019),\n\n\nit does not follow that,\n\nIf x is desired, then x ought to be desired\n(\u2018is desirable\u2019).\n\n\nYet in claiming that pleasure or power are valuable, Mill and the\nN-Realist Nietzsche are advancing a normative thesis. The truth of\nthis normative thesis, however, simply does not follow from the\ncorresponding descriptive thesis.\n\nMany, of course, have thought this too facile a response. Supplement\nthe argument, then, by adding an \u2018Internalist Constraint\u2019\n(IC), one that many philosophers have found plausible in the theory of\nvalue:\n\n(IC) Something cannot be valuable for a person unless the person is\ncapable of caring about (desiring) it.\n\n\nThe (IC) is motivated by the thought that it cannot be right to say\nthat \u2018X is valuable\u2019 for someone when x is alien\nto anything a person cares about or could care about: any\nplausible notion of value, the (IC) supposes, must have some strong\nconnection to a person\u2019s existing (or potential) motivational\nset.\n\nHow does the (IC) help? Recall (P):\n\n(P) To show that something is desirable (i.e., valuable) show that it\nis desired.\n\n\nNow the (IC) puts a constraint on what things can, in fact, be\ndesirable or valuable: namely, only those things that agents can, in\nfact, care about or desire. This suggests that we might reformulate\n(P) as follows:\n\n(P\u2032) To show that something is desirable (i.e., valuable), show\nthat it is or can be desired.\n\n\n(P\u2032) now is simply a different formulation of the (IC): if we\naccept the (IC) then we should accept (P\u2032). But what happens,\nthen, if we grant the truth of Descriptive Hedonism: namely, that only\npleasure is, in fact, desired. In that case, it would now follow that\nonly pleasure is desirable (ought to be desired) (assuming, again,\nthat Value Nihilism is false). That is, since something ought to be\ndesired only if it can be desired (internalism), then if only\nx can be desired, then only x ought to be\ndesired (assuming that Value Nihilism is false).\n\nWill this argument rescue the N-Realist Nietzsche? Two obstacles\nremain. The first, and perhaps less serious one, is that we must have\nsome reason for accepting the (IC) \u2014 or, more modestly, some\nreason for thinking Nietzsche accepts it. It is not clear, however,\nthat there are adequate textual grounds for saying where Nietzsche\nstands on this question. Since the (IC) does, however, seem to be\npresupposed by the Nietzschean remarks from the Nachlass that\nsupport N-Realism \u2014 in the sense that such remarks do not\nconstitute a good argument without the (IC) \u2014 let us grant that\nNietzsche accepts the (IC), and let us simply put aside the\ncontentious issue of whether we ought to accept the (IC) as a general\nphilosophical matter.\n\nA second difficulty will still remain: namely, that the argument for\nN-Realism still depends on the truth of the relevant descriptive\nthesis, in Nietzsche\u2019s case, the doctrine of the will to power.\nThis presents two problems. First, in the works Nietzsche chose to\npublish, it seems clear that he did not, in fact, accept the doctrine\nin the strong form required for the N-Realist argument (namely, that\nit is only power that persons ever aim for or desire). Second, it is\nsimply not a plausible doctrine in its strong form.\n\nFor the Millian Model argument for N-Realism to work in its new form\n(that is, supplemented with the (IC)) it must be the case that that\nwhich ought to be desired (\u2018is valuable\u2019) are the\nonly things that are, in fact, desired. Since the N-Realist\nNietzschean conclusion is that only power is valuable, power must be\nthe only thing that is, in fact, desired (assuming, again, that\nsomething is valuable, i.e., that Value Nihilism is false).\nMany, of course, have thought that Nietzsche held precisely this view,\nand he plainly says much to suggest that. Zarathustra states that,\n\u201cWhere I found the living, there I found will to power\u201d (Z\nII:12); Nietzsche refers to \u201cthe will to power which is the will\nof life\u201d (GS 349); he says \u201cthe really fundamental\ninstinct of life\u2026aims at the expansion of power\u201d\n(GS 349); \u201clife simply is will to power,\u201d meaning\na striving \u201cto grow, spread, seize, become predominant\u201d\n(BGE 259); he refers to his \u201ctheory that in all events a\nwill to power is operating\u201d (GM II:12); he claims that\n\u201c[a] living thing seeks above all to discharge its\nstrength \u2014 life itself is will to power\u201d (BGE\n13); and so on.\n\nThe difficulty is that Nietzsche says other things which might suggest\nthat the stronger remarks are misleading; for example:\n\nLife itself is to my mind the instinct for growth, for durability, for\nan accumulation of forces, for power: where the will to power\nis lacking there is decline. It is my contention that all the supreme\nvalues of mankind lack this will\u2026. (A 6)\n\n\nBut if all actions manifested this will, then this\nwill could never be found lacking. Yet Nietzsche thinks it\ncan be lacking, which means he must countenance the possibility that\nnot everyone aims for (\u2018desires\u2019) power.\n\nThis passage is not atypical. Later in the same work, he returns to\nthe same theme concerning \u201c[w]herever the will to power declines\nin any form\u201d (A 17). In the immediately preceding work he claims\nthat the \u201ceffects\u201d of liberal institutions are\n\u201cknown well enough: they undermine the will to power\u201d (TI\nIX:38). And in the immediately subsequent work (his last), Nietzsche\nrefers to \u201cthe terrible aspects of reality (in affects,\nin desires, in the will to power)\u2026\u201d (EH IV:4), which\ncertainly sounds as if will to power is simply one among various\ncharacteristics of reality \u2014 alongside affects and\ndesires, rather than the essential core of them all.\n\nThree other general textual considerations count against attributing\nthe strong doctrine of the will to power to Nietzsche. First, if, as\nthe defenders of the strong doctrine believe, \u201chis fundamental\nprinciple is the \u2018will to power\u2019\u201d, then it\nis hard to understand why he says almost nothing about will to power\n\u2014 and nothing at all to suggest it is his \u201cfundamental\nprinciple\u201d \u2014 in the two major self-reflective moments in\nthe Nietzschean corpus: his last major work, Ecce Homo, where\nhe reviews and assesses his life and writings, including specifically\nall his prior books (EH III); and the series of new prefaces he wrote\nfor The Birth of Tragedy, Human, All Too Human,\nDawn, and The Gay Science in 1886, in which he\nrevisits his major themes. That this putative \u201cfundamental\nprinciple\u201d merits no mention on either occasion strongly\nsuggests that its role in Nietzsche\u2019s thought has been greatly\noverstated.\n\nSecond, the view at issue presupposes an unusually strong doctrine of\nthe will to power: a doctrine, to the effect, that all life\n(actions, events) reflects the will to power. But recent scholarship\nhas cast doubt on whether Nietzsche ultimately accepted such a\ndoctrine. The single most famous passage on will to power in the\nNietzschean corpus, for example, is the concluding section (1067) of\nThe Will to Power, where he affirms that, \u201cThis\nworld is the will to power \u2014 and nothing besides! And you\nyourselves are also this will to power \u2014 and nothing\nbesides!\u201d Although a favorite of commentators for many years,\nthe passage has now been conclusively discredited by the leading\nscholar of the Nachlass, the late Mazzino Montinari.\nMontinari has shown that Nietzsche had, in fact, discarded the passage\nby the spring of 1887 (1982, pp. 103\u2013104)! It was, as Montinari\nnotes, made part of the K\u00f6selitz-Forster compilation of The\nWill to Power (the basis for the English-language edition by\nKaufmann and Hollingdale) notwithstanding \u201cNietzsche\u2019s\nliterary intentions\u201d (1982, p. 104).\n\nFinally, Maudemarie Clark has argued that Nietzsche could not have\naccepted the very strongest form of the doctrine of the will to power\n\u2014 namely, that all force, animate and inanimate, is\nwill to power \u2014 given the putative argument he gives for it.\nClark points out that the only argument for this\ndoctrine of the will to power in Nietzsche\u2019s published works\n\u2014 in Section 36 of Beyond Good and Evil \u2014 is cast\nin the conditional form: if we accept certain initial hypotheses,\nthen, Nietzsche thinks, the strong doctrine of the will to power\nfollows. But one of the antecedents of this conditional is the\n\u201ccausality of the will,\u201d and Clark argues that Nietzsche\nclearly rejects such causality elsewhere in his work (e.g.,\nGS 127, TI II:5, TI VI:3). Therefore, this section cannot constitute\nan argument for the strongest doctrine of the will to power that\nNietzsche, himself, would actually accept! Rather than embracing the\nstrongest form of the doctrine, Clark argues that Nietzsche is,\nsomewhat ironically, illustrating the very flaw of philosophers he\nwarns against in the surrounding passages: namely, their tendency to\npropound theories of the essence of reality that are just projections\nof their own evaluative commitments (Clark 1990, pp. 212\u2013227).\nThus, Nietzsche says of the Stoic talk of living \u201caccording to\nnature\u201d that \u201cwhile you pretend rapturously to read the\ncanon of your law in nature, you want something opposite\u2026.Your\npride wants to impose your morality, your ideal, on\nnature\u2026\u201d (BGE 9). How, Clark wonders, could\nNietzsche\u2019s own doctrine of will to power be exempted from such\na charge? (Note, too, that Montinari claims that the one surviving\nrelic of 1067 of The Will to Power in the published works is\nprecisely the ironic Section 36 of Beyond Good and Evil\n(1982, p. 104).)\n\nWhat, then, does Nietzsche believe about will to power? There are, to\nbe sure, competing views in the secondary literature. Reginster 2006\ntreats will to power as a will to overcome resistances; Richardson\n1996 treats will to power as the tendency of every drive to redirect\nevery other drive towards its own ends. As others have noted (e.g.,\nClark 1990: 209\u2013212), Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of will to\npower, in its original deployment and most of its later occurrences in\nthe published work, is psychological in character: the will\nto power is posited as the best psychological explanation for a wide\nvariety of human behaviors. Here Richardson\u2019s account seems to\nfare somewhat better than Reginster\u2019s. (Katsafanas 2013b follows\nReginster, and tries to develop a \u201cconstitutivist\u201d account\nof objective value based on the idea that all actions aim to overcome\nresistances; Huddleston 2017 offers a trenchant critique of the\nplausibility of such a view.) Yet Richardson\u2019s account has\ndifficulty with some of Nietzsche\u2019s claims, as when he says that\n\u201cevery animal\u2026instinctively strives for optimal conditions\nunder which it can\u2026attain its maximum in the feeling of power\u201d\n(GM III:7), which seems to propose desire for power as a competitor\nwith psychological hedonism. But a universal desire for either\npleasure or power feelings is not especially plausible, even if both\nmotives are important ones. Indeed, as the preceding passages and\nconsiderations make clear, Nietzsche could not have believed that will\nto power was the exclusive explanation for all human behavior. To the\nextent he sometimes seems to embrace this stronger claim (see the\nexample, above), we must simply take Nietzsche to have overstated his\ncase \u2014 something which his penchant for hyperbolic rhetoric and\npolemics often leads him to do \u2014 or to be engaged in the kind of\nironic move described by Clark, above. That would, of course, be quite\nfortunate, since it is hardly plausible that will to power is the\nexclusive explanation for all human behavior\n\nThere is an additional, textual worry for the argument that will to\npower provides an objective criterion of value lurking here as well.\nNietzsche only makes the remarks that seem to suggest that power is an\nobjective criterion in passages from the Nachlass, work that\nNietzsche never published during his lifetime. Thus, even if one\nthought that Nietzsche really held the strong descriptive doctrine of\nthe will to power \u2014 the doctrine that all animate force (perhaps\nall force) is will to power \u2014 in his published works,\nit is still the case that he only uses this doctrine to argue for the\nnormative conclusion in Nachlass material. Since scholars\nhave now raised important doubts about the canonical status of this\nNachlass material (Montinari 1982, pp. 92\u2013104;\nHollingdale 1985, pp. 166\u2013172, 182\u2013186), this might\nsuggest that a view ought not to be attributed to Nietzsche\nsolely on the basis of its articulation in these notebooks,\nwhich is exactly what the N-Realist reading requires. (For more recent\ndebate about the relevance of the Nachlass material to\nunderstanding will to power, see Katsafanas 2013b, pp. 248\u2013250 and\nLeiter 2019, pp. 60\u201362.)\n\nAlthough not attributing to Nietzsche any kind of value realism,\nPhilippa Foot, like Schacht, wants to show that Nietzsche is doing\nsomething more than simply expressing his idiosyncratic view, a view\nthat admits of no interpersonal justification. While agreeing that\nNietzsche\u2019s intention is, in part, \u201cto present us with a\nclash of interests \u2014 the good of the strong against that of the\nweak,\u201d Foot adds that \u201cthis is not all he wants to\nsuggest\u201d (1973: 162). Noting that Nietzsche \u201cseems to want\nto say that anyone who is strong, independent, and so on \u2014\nanyone who fits his description of the higher type of man \u2014 is\none who has value in himself\u201d (163), Foot goes on to\nexplicate this notion of \u201cvalue\u201d as follows:\n\n[I]t does make sense to say that we value strong and\nexceptional individuals\u2026. We do find patterns of reaction to\nexceptional men that would allow us to see here a valuing rather\nsimilar to valuing on aesthetic grounds\u2026. I am thinking of the\ninterest and admiration which is the common attitude to remarkable men\nof exceptional independence of mind and strength of will\u2026.\n[Nietzsche] is appealing to our tendency to admire certain\nindividuals whom we see as powerful and splendid\u2026. [There is] a\nsimilarity between the way we attribute value (aesthetic\nvalue) to art objects and the value that Nietzsche attributes\nto a certain kind of man, both resting on a set of common\nreactions\u2026. (1973: 163)\n\n\nSo Nietzsche, on this account, does not claim that his evaluative\nperspective is veridical; he simply claims that it enjoys a certain\nsort of interpersonal appeal, owing to our \u201ccommon attitude to\nremarkable men,\u201d \u201cour tendency to admire certain\nindividuals,\u201d to find them aesthetically appealing. There may be\nno fact-of-the-matter as to whether higher men are or are not\nreally valuable, but Nietzsche\u2019s evaluative standpoint\nis privileged by virtue of its appeal to all of us. We\u2019re all\ninterested, it seems, in the flourishing of higher men.\n\nYet Nietzsche could not embrace the view that the flourishing of\n\u201chigher men\u201d will appeal to \u201cour\ntendency\u201d to admire such men or to any sort of\n\u201ccommon\u201d attitude, given the logic of his critique of\nmorality. This follows from what we may call Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u2018Callicleanism,\u2019 after Plato\u2019s Callicles in the\nGorgias. It has now become something of a commonplace for\ncommentators to note that Nietzsche did not accept one sort\nof Calliclean view, namely, the view that \u201canyone who is to live\naright should suffer his appetites to grow to the greatest extent and\nnot check them\u201d (Gorgias, 419e) (cf. Nehamas 1985:\n202\u2013203; BGE 188). Yet there remains a more important respect in\nwhich Nietzsche\u2019s view is Calliclean: namely, in its\nembrace of the Calliclean doctrine that the inferior employ morality\nto make \u201cslaves of those who are naturally better\u201d\n(Gorgias, 491e-492a), that the weaker folk, the\nmajority\u2026frame the laws [and, we might add, the morals] for\ntheir own advantage\u2019 in order to \u2018frighten [the strong] by\nsaying that to overreach others is shameful and evil\u2019\n(Gorgias, 483b-d). In short, Callicles\u2019 view is that\nmorality is simply the prudence of the weak, who unable to do what the\nstrong can do, opt instead to put the actions of the strong under the\nban of morality. This, of course, is essentially Nietzsche\u2019s\nview as well. So, for example, Nietzsche describes slave morality as\nsimply \u2018the prudence [Klugheit] of the lowest\norder\u2019 (GM I:13), and he observes that \u201ceverything that\nelevates an individual above the herd and intimidates the neighbor\nis\u2026called evil\u201d (BGE 201), that \u201c[m]oral\njudgments and condemnations constitute the favorite revenge of the\nspiritually limited against those less limited\u201d (BGE 219), and\nhe claims that the \u201cchief means\u201d by which the \u201cweak\nand mediocre\u2026weaken and pull down the stronger\u201d is\n\u201cthe moral judgment\u201d (WP 345).\n\nRecall, now, that Foot wanted to resist the view that in his\nrevaluation Nietzsche simply \u201cpresent[s] us with a clash of\ninterests \u2014 the good of the strong against that of the\nweak\u201d (1973: 162); instead, Foot suggests that Nietzsche is\nappealing to a \u2018common\u2019 tendency to admire higher men, men\nwho would otherwise be thwarted by the reign of moral values. But for\na Calliclean like Nietzsche, it is part of the very appeal of morality\nthat it does thwart the flourishing of higher men. If that is\nright, then he could not think that the flourishing of\n\u201chigher men\u201d would appeal to everyone. It is precisely\nbecause it doesn\u2019t that morality arises in the first place, as a\nmeans for the low and base to thwart the flourishing of the high. This\nis not to deny that higher men may still be admirable in the eyes of\nthe base and low (hence their envy); it is to deny, however, that\nNietzsche\u2019s evaluative perspective \u2014 that it is an\nobjection to morality that it thwarts the high \u2014 could\nenjoy a privilege in virtue of this shared admiration. On the\nCalliclean picture, there is a fundamental hostility between the high\nand low, the strong and the weak, one which will not be bridged by\ninviting the low to admire the high, or the weak, the strong.\n\u201cThe well-being of the majority and the well-being of the few\nare opposite viewpoints of value,\u201d Nietzsche says in the\n\u2018Note\u2019 at the end of the first essay of the\nGenealogy. And in Nietzsche\u2019s revaluation, it appears,\nthere is no evaluative standpoint from which one could successfully\nmediate and reconcile the normative claims of the opposing\nmoralities.\n",
