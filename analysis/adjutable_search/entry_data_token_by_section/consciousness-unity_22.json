    "main_text": "Neural Architecture of Unified Consciousness\n9. Conclusions\n\nA great deal of work has been done on the unity of consciousness in\nthe past few decades. Our introduction to it has been grouped around\nthe following themes: \n\nIn some form, the unity of consciousness is a pervasive,\ncognitively important feature of our kind of mind. \nEven phenomenal unity of consciousness at a time comes in a number\nof forms and consciousness is also unified across time. \nThe ways in which unified consciousness can break down raise\ninteresting questions about the phenomenon and throw important light\non its structure.\nThe topic connects to a number of important issues concerning the\nrelationship of consciousness to cognition, including whether unified\nconsciousness across time plays a role in personal identity (the\nphilosophers\u2019 concept of personal identity).\nAll the leading theories of the unity of consciousness face\nproblems.\nThe state of theorizing on the topic suggests that there is still\nmuch room for further work. \n\n",
