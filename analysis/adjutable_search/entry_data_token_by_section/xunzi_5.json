Portents (yao \u7945)\n\nIn accordance with his notion of the Way as the observable\n\u201cconstancies\u201d that can be profitably applied to human\nconduct, Xunzi argued strongly against the notion that weird\noccurrences on earth can be rationalized as monitory signs from\nHeaven. Superficially terrifying occurrences such as shooting stars or\nsqualling trees are merely \u201cshifts in Heaven and Earth,\ntransformations of yin and yang, material\nanomalies\u201d (Xunzi 17.7). We should be concerned instead\nwith \u201chuman portents\u201d (renyao \u4eba\u7945),\na term that would have seemed as counterintuitive in Xunzi\u2019s\nlanguage as it does in ours. \u201cHuman portents\u201d are the many\nshortsighted and immoral acts through which human beings bring on\ntheir own destruction: \u201cpoor plowing that harms the harvest,\nhoeing and weeding out of season, governmental malice that causes the\nloss of the people\u201d (Xunzi 17.7). Heaven has no part in\nsuch wrongdoing. Now and then strange things may happen in the skies,\nbut they have happened at all moments in history, and they have never\nbeen sufficient to destroy a prudent and moral society\u2014whereas\nan imprudent and immoral society will fail even if it is spared an\neclipse.\n\nXunzi even extends this theory of \u201chuman portents\u201d to\ncontend that religious ceremonies have no numinous effect; we carry\nthem out merely for their inherent beauty and the social cohesion that\nthey\n promote.[8]\n\n\n\nIf the sacrifice for rain [is performed], and it rains, what of it? I\nsay: It is nothing. Even if there had been no sacrifice, it would have\nrained. \u2026 Thus the noble man takes [these ceremonies] to be\nembellishment, but the populace takes them to be spiritual. To take\nthem as embellishment is auspicious; to take them as spiritual is\ninauspicious. (Xunzi 17.8)\n\n",
