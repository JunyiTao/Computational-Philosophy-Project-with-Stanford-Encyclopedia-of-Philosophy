    "main_text": "Varieties of Anti-Intellectualism || Ability Based Anti-Intellectualism\n8.2 Ability Based Anti-Intellectualism\n\nAs we have seen, Ryle is often interpreted as claiming that\nknowledge-how ascriptions are nothing more than ascriptions of an\nability or a complex of dispositions to act in a skilled or\nintelligent manner (Hornsby 2011). (For a recent defense of\nknowledge-how as an ability, see Markie 2015.) Anti-intellectualism of\nthis sort has been voiced by Lewis (1990) and has been thought to\nundercut the so-called \u201cknowledge-argument\u201d in the\nphilosophy of mind (see Jackson 1986 for a classic formulation. For\nfurther discussion, see Nemirow 1990 and Alter 2001). However, Cath\n(2009) argues that similar worries about the argument survive even on\nsome prominent intellectualist views. For a survey of other\nconsequences thought to follow from the various positions in the\nknowledge-how debate, see Bengson and Moffett (2011b:\n44\u201354).\n\nHowever, few theorists nowadays identify knowledge-how with bare\nabilities. Setiya (2012) holds that to have knowledge-how is to have\nthe disposition to act guided by one\u2019s intention; Constantin\n(2018) argues that knowing how to \u03a6 is to have the disposition to\nhave the ability to \u03a6. Neo-Rylean views are also developed by\nCraig (1990), Wiggins (2012), and L\u00f6wenstein (2016). Craig\nsuggests that knowledge-how to \u03a6 amounts to the ability to teach\nothers how to \u03a6. Wiggins argues that genuine knowledge-how stems\nfrom a bundle of practical abilities that constitute the ethos of a\npractice and, while interrelated with propositional knowledge, cannot\nbe reduced to it. In turn, L\u00f6wenstein argues that knowledge-how\nto \u03a6 is the ability to \u03a6 intelligently guided by the\nunderstanding of the activity of \u03a6-ing. \n\nCarter and Pritchard (2015a,b,c) develop an alternative view which\ndoes not equate knowledge-how with an ability, but it still gives\nability a central theoretical role. In their view, knowing how to\n\u03a6 is a cognitive achievement, given our abilities to\n\u03a6: if one successfully \u03a6s because of one\u2019s ability, then\none knows how to \u03a6. And if one knows how to \u03a6, then one is\npositioned to successfully \u03a6 because of one\u2019s ability.\nTherefore, for them, knowledge-how does not reduce to the mere\npossession of abilities but it essentially involves the successful\nenactment of these abilities. Habgood-Coote (2019) defends the view\nthat knowing how to \u03a6 just is the ability to generate the right\nanswers to the question of how to \u03a6. Although on this view,\nknowledge-how is a relation an agent bears to a proposition\u2014one\nthat answers the relevant practical question\u2014this relation to a\nproposition is not understood in epistemic terms but in terms of\ndispositions (see also Audi 2017 and Farkas 2017).\n8.3 Radical Anti-Intellectualism: Practicalism\n\nWhile the intellectualist holds that knowledge-how must be understood\nin terms of knowledge-that, radical anti-intellectualism\nholds that knowledge-that must be understood in terms of knowledge-how\nor skill. As Hetherington puts it: \n\n\nYour knowing that p is your having the ability to\nmanifest various accurate representations of p. The knowledge\nas such is the ability as such. (2011: 42, original emphasis) \n\n\nAn agent knows that, for instance, she is in France whenever she is\nable to produce the corresponding true belief, to assert that she is\nindeed in France, provide justification, answer related questions,\netc. (see Hartland-Swann 1956; Roland 1958 for classic formulation and\nHetherington\u2019s 2006, 2011, 2020 \u201cpracticalism\u201d for a\nmore recent form of radical anti-intellectualism).\n9. Knowledge-How and Skill\n9.1 Skill Across Cultures\n\nThe most recent debate on knowledge-how has intertwined with a debate\non the nature of skills. While there is no consensus on what counts as\na skill, by and large people take skills to manifest in purposeful and\ngoal-directed activities and to be learnable and improvable through\npractice (Fitts & Posner 1967; Stanley & Krakauer 2013;\nWillingham 1998; Yarrow, Brown, & Krakauer 2009). Skills are\nusually contrasted with knacks (or mere talents). Some\ncontrast them with habits (Pear 1926; Ryle 1949) in that these are\nperformed automatically, whereas the exercise of intelligent\ncapacities involves self-control, attention to the conditions, and\nawareness of the task. Others, instead, argue that understanding skill\nrequires a better understanding of what habits amount to (Gallagher\n2017; Hutto & Robertson 2020).\n\nThe topic of skill and expertise is central since ancient philosophy\nthrough the notion of techn\u0113. Although both Plato and\nAristotle took techn\u0113 to be a kind of knowledge, there\nis significant controversy about their conceptions regarding the\nnature of this kind of knowledge and its relation to experience\n(empeiria) on one hand, and scientific knowledge\n(epist\u0113m\u0113) on the other (Johansen 2017; Lorenz\n& Morison 2019; Coope 2020). Annas (1995, 2001, 2011) develops an\ninterpretation on which skill and virtue (or phron\u0113sis)\nare closer in Aristotle\u2019s action theory than usually thought and\nthey are both conceived along a broadly intellectualist model. \n\nIn contemporary times, the notion of skill is central to the\nphilosophy of the twentieth-century French phenomenologist Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty. Merleau-Ponty (1945 [1962]) distinguishes between\nmotor intentionality\u2014the sort of intentionality\nrelevant for motor skills\u2014and cognitive intentionality.\nWhile the latter is conceptual and representational, Merleau-Ponty\nthought that motor intentionality is non-representational and\nnon-conceptual. Central to Merleau-Ponty is the role of motor skills\nin shaping perceptual experience: in paradigmatic cases of perception,\nthe flow of information taken in by perceivers is inseparable from the\nway they move through a scene. On this view, even superficially static\nperceptions engage motor skills, such as seeing the color of a table\nas uniform when different parts of it are differently illuminated (see\nSiegel 2020 for an helpful introduction).\n\nThis phenomenological tradition inspires Dreyfus\u2019 (1991, 2000,\n2002, 2005, 2007) critique of standard action theory. According to\nDreyfus, theories on which an action is intentional only if the agent\nis in a mental state that represents the goal of her action (cf.\nSearle 1980, 2001) or on which actions are permeated by conceptual\nrationality (cf. McDowell 2007) are not supported by the phenomenology\nof purposive activity. Paradigmatic examples of these purposive\nactivities are, for Dreyfus, skillful activities like playing tennis\nor habitual activity like rolling over in bed or making gestures while\nspeaking. In this sort of skillful coping, Dreyfus thought that the\nmind does not represent the world as detached from it. Rather, it is\nfundamentally embedded, absorbed, and embodied (see Gehrman &\nSchwenkler 2020 for an helpful introduction to Dreyfus on skills).\n\n\nThe notion of skill is central also in Eastern philosophy. Garfield\nand Priest (2020) examine the various roles that the notion of skill\nplays in the Indian school of Mahayana Buddhism, in Daoism, and in\nChan/Zen thought. In Daoism as well as in Chan/Zen Buddhism, the\nemphasis on skill is also connected, fundamentally, to concerns about\nliving a good and ethical life. Sarkissan (2020) argues that two\nprominent types of expertise often encountered in ancient Chinese\nthought from the sixth to third centuries BCE: The first is expertise\nat a particular craft, occupation, or dao, as is most\nfamously presented in the Daoist anthology Zhuangzi. The\nsecond is ethical expertise in the Ruist (Confucian) and Mohist\nschools (cf. for more on skill in Buddhism, see also MacKenzie\n2020).\n9.2 Intellectualism and Anti-Intellectualism About Skill\n\nWhat is the relation between knowledge-how and skill? For many tasks\nat least, it is intuitive that one cannot be skilled at it without\nknowing how to perform it. At first, it also seems as if knowledge-how\nentails skill: one does not really know how to swim if one does not\nhave the skill to swim; and one cannot know how to tell apart birds\nwithout the skills of a bird watcher. One might object to the\nsufficiency of knowledge-how for skill on the grounds that it is\nnatural to say things such as \u201cJohn may know how to make\nrisotto, but I would not say he is skilled at it\u201d. However,\nknowing how to make risotto sufficiently well (relative to\ncontextually determined standards) might entail being skilled at it\n(relative to the same standards) (Cath 2020).\n\nRyle (1946, 1949) used \u201cskill\u201d and\n\u201cknowledge-how\u201d interchangeably in his criticism of the\n\u201cIntellectualist legend\u201d (for discussion, see Kremer\n2020). In fact, Ryle\u2019s view of knowledge-how is stated,\nliterally, as the view that \u201cskill\u201d is a complex of\ndispositions (Ryle 1949: 33; see also Ryle 1967, 1974, 1976 for his\nviews on how skill as a form of knowledge is distinguished by the\nforms on how it is taught and learned through training). This\ndiscussion brings us to whether intellectualism about knowledge-how\nand intellectualism about skill stand or fall together.\nShould intellectualists about knowledge-how identify skill too with\npropositional knowledge? While Stanley and Williamson (2001) embrace\nthe view that knowledge-how is propositional knowledge, in a recent\npaper (Stanley & Williamson 2017), they refuse to think of\nskill as a standing propositional knowledge state. Rather,\nthey argue that skills are dispositions to know. One motivation for\nthis view is that this addresses the novelty challenge raised by\nDreyfus (1991, 2005). According to this challenge, propositional\nknowledge cannot explain the ability to respond intelligently to\nsituations that have not been encountered by the agent before. If\nskills are dispositions to know, it is no mystery how novel situations\ncan be handled by skillful agents. Stanley & Williamson (2017)\nclaim that the resulting view is still broadly intellectualist in a\nsense, because on it, skillful action manifests propositional\nknowledge (for a criticism of this response to the novelty objection,\nsee Pavese 2016 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nSome authors argue that while skills may be related to propositional\nknowledge, they do not reduce to it. Dickie (2012) suggests that an\nagent is skilled at \u03a6 whenever her intentions to \u03a6 are\nnon-lucky selectors of non-lucky means to \u03a6; while, in turn, these\nmeans might manifest propositional knowledge. Some argue that control\nis necessary for skills, and control cannot fully be understood in\nterms of propositional knowledge (Fridland 2014, 2017a, 2017b). In\norder to provide a theory of skill that makes room for control,\nFridland (2020) develops a \u201cfunctional\u201d account of skills.\nIn this view, a skill is a function from intentions to action,\nimplemented through certain \u201ccontrol structures\u201d, which\ninclude attention and strategic control. Among these control\nstructures, there is also propositional knowledge, which is required\nfor strategic control. In contrast, intellectualists about skills\nargue that being in control is not intelligible unless it is\nunderstood in terms of knowing what one is doing in virtue of knowing\nhow to perform that action. Therefore, they argue that agentive\ncontrol itself is best understood in terms of the capacity for\npropositional knowledge.\n9.3 Skills in Epistemology\n\nUnderstanding the nature of skill and its relation with knowledge is\nof crucial importance for virtue epistemology\u2014the view that\nknowledge is to be defined in terms of the success of our cognitive\nskills (Zagzebski 2003, 2008; Sosa 2007, 2009; J. Greco 2003, 2010;\nPritchard 2012; Turri 2013, 2016; Beddor & Pavese 2020; Pritchard\n2020). Nevertheless, if it turns out that skill must be explained in\nterms of knowledge, virtue epistemology would be trying to account for\nknowledge in terms of knowledge and so would be viciously circular\n(see Millar 2009; Stanley & Williamson 2017 for an argument in\nthis spirit). Some virtue epistemologists have responded by offering\nan anti-intellectualist account of knowledge-yielding cognitive\nskills. Sosa and Callahan (2020) describe the relevant skills as\ndispositions to succeed when one tries\u2014such that knowledge is\nobtained when agents in the right shape and in the right situation\nenact these skills appropriately.\n9.4 The Nature of Skilled Action\n\nRecent discussions on skill include a renewed debate on the nature of\nskilled action\u2014i.e., on the sort of processes that are involved\nin the manifestation of skills. The most recent discussion on skilled\naction concerns the extent to which they are automatic or under\nconscious control. A long tradition has taken skilled action to be\nparadigmatically a matter of \u201cabsorbed coping\u201d (Heidegger\n1927; Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962]; Dreyfus 1991)\u2014characterized as\nimmersion in the situation and intuitive response to its demands, with\nlittle awareness of the body, tools or even possibly the activity\nitself. Following Dreyfus and the phenomenological tradition, some\nenactivists (e.g., No\u00eb 2004) highlight the analogies between\nskillful behavior and perception; other enactivists (e.g., Gallagher\n2017; Hutto & Robertson 2020) argue that in order to understand\nthe automaticity and unreflectiveness of skilled action, we ought to\nbetter understand habitual behavior. Even outside the phenomenological\ntradition, people have emphasized the unreflective aspect of skilled\naction. For example, Papineau (2013) argues that skilled actions are\ntypically too fast for conscious control. One important argument for\nthe unreflectiveness of skilled action starts from the phenomenon of\nchoking under pressure, where an individual performs significantly\nworse than would be expected in a high-pressure situation. This\nphenomenon has been taken to be evidence that skillful action proceeds\nwithout conscious attention, because choking episodes are thought to\narise from the fact that anxiety leads one to focus and direct\none\u2019s mind on the performance, which would proceed smoothly if\nmindless (Baumeister 1984; Masters 1992; Beilock & Carr 2001;\nFord, Hodges, & Williams 2005; Jackson, Ashford, & Norsworthy\n2006; Gucciardi & Dimmock 2008). Some argue that unreflectiveness\nalso characterizes skillful joint action (H\u00f8ffding 2014;\nGallagher and Ilund\u00e1in-Agurruza 2020).\n\nIn recent years, however, some have emphasized the role of attention\nand consciousness in skillful performance (Montero 2016, 2020; Wu\n2016, 2020). Montero argues against the Dreyfusian idea of skillful\nand mindless coping, by noting that online conscious thought about\nwhat one is doing is compatible with expertise and by surveying\nempirical evidence that suggests revisiting the choking argument.\nChristensen, Sutton and McIlwain (2016) and Christensen, Sutton, and\nBicknell\u2019s (2019) argue for the centrality of cognition in\nexplaining the flexibility of skilled action in complex situations and\nadvance a \u201cmesh theory\u201d of skilled action, according to\nwhich skilled action results for a mesh of both automatic and\ncognitively controlled processes (for a survey of some of these\nissues, Christensen 2019. See also Sutton 2007 and Fridland\n2017b).\n10. Knowledge-How and Other Related Topics\n\nKnowledge-how is related to but distinct from practical\nknowledge (Anscombe 1957). Practical knowledge is occurrent\nduring intentional action: when one intentionally acts, one knows what\none is doing while knowing it. While being capable of practical\nknowledge might require knowledge-how, knowing how to perform an\naction does not entail performing that action, and so does not entail\npractical knowledge (Setiya 2008; Schwenkler 2019; Small 2020). Some\nhave argued knowledge-how is the norm of intention (Habgood-Coote\n2018b), so that one can properly intend to perform an act only if one\nknows how to perform it. \n\nAn important question is whether knowledge-how is connected to\ndistinctive kinds of epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007; Dotson 2011;\nCollins 1990, 1998; Medina 2011). Hawley (2011) discusses the\nphenomena whereby people ascribe less knowledge-how and ability to\nfemale musicians (Goldin & Rouse 2000) and whereby standards for\njudgments of success due to ability rather than luck or\n\u201cinstinct\u201d tend to be higher for women and non-white men\n(Biernat & Kobrynowicz 1997). In these cases, agents may be\ntransmitting knowledge by being direct sources of information, rather\nthan by testifying to the truth of a proposition. If so, the harms\nthat they suffer might call for a different account than standard\ncases of epistemic injustices like Fricker\u2019s (2007), which focus\non testimonial transmission of knowledge-that.\n\nA final topic of interest is the relation between knowledge-how and\nfaith. While most views on faith focus on its doxastic aspect, Sliwa\n(2018) argues that faith essentially involves agents acting in the\nright way with respect to the object of their faith. Having faith in a\nperson, for instance, requires knowing how to interact with them so as\nto trust them, help them, and ensure their autonomy in general.\nReligious faith, similarly, requires faithful agents to know how to\nenact the relevant practices like going to mass, declaring one\u2019s\nfaith, and praying.",
