    "main_text": "Why informed consent? || Non-domination\n2.6 Non-domination\n\nBioethicists rarely explore the value of\n non-domination\n as a rationale for informed consent, although this rationale is used\nextensively in sexual ethics and political philosophy. The idea here\nwould be that no one should be under the arbitrary control of another\nand that informed consent requirements help to prevent such arbitrary\ncontrol. One would argue that medicine is rife with potential to\nbecome hierarchical, given the utter dependency of patients and\nresearch participants on physicians (Levine 1988, 121\u20132), as\nwell as the knowledge gaps between them, especially in the\ninvestigational context. Therefore, it is important to ensure that\npatients and research participants retain a high degree of control\nover what happens to them, and informed consent helps with this. This\nrationale may shed light on the special importance of informed consent\nto research participation\u2014where the knowledge gap is greater,\nand where there is a specific informed consent right to withdraw from\nresearch at any point. Even if one has autonomously waived protection,\narbitrary control by others, without the protection of a consent\nrequirement, remains intolerable.\n\nThe non-domination rationale has difficulty explaining why physicians\nand investigators who are closely monitored and cannot afford to\nmistreat patients would also be obligated to let patients decide.\nArguably, some existing systems have ample institutional mechanisms in\nplace to prevent physicians and investigators from exercising\narbitrary control, even without informed consent requirements, and yet\ncommonsense recognizes such requirements.\n",
