Introduction\n\nAround 500 B. C. Heraclitus wrote the following:\n\nEverything flows and nothing abides; everything gives way and nothing\nstays fixed.\n\n\nYou cannot step twice into the same river, for other waters and yet\nothers, go flowing on.\n\nTime is a child, moving counters in a game; the royal power is a\n child\u2019s.[1]\n\n\nTransience is basic, and the present is primary. Those things which\nexist now do not abide. They slip into the past and non-existence,\ndevoured by time, as all experience attests.\n\nA generation or so later we have a classic statement of the opposing\nview by Parmenides:\n\nThere remains, then, but one word by which to express the [true] road:\nIs. And on this road there are many signs that What Is has no\nbeginning and never will be destroyed: it is whole, still, and without\nend. It neither was nor will be, it simply is\u2014now, altogether,\none, continuous\u2026\n\n\nPermanence is basic. No things come to be or, slipping into the past,\ncease to be. Past, present, and future are distinctions not marked in\nthe static Is. Time and becoming are at best secondary, at worst\nillusory, as our understanding of the world confirms.\n\nTurn now to modern times and to a paragraph in Rudolf Carnap\u2019s\nintellectual autobiography (Carnap 1963, pp. 37\u201338):\n\nOnce Einstein said that the problem of the Now worried him seriously.\nHe explained that the experience of the Now means something special\nfor man, something essentially different from the past and the future,\nbut that this important difference does not and cannot occur within\nphysics. That this experience cannot be grasped by science seemed to\nhim a matter of painful but inevitable resignation. I remarked that\nall that occurs objectively can be described in science; on the one\nhand the temporal sequence of events is described in physics; and, on\nthe other hand, the peculiarities of man\u2019s experiences with\nrespect to time, including his different attitude towards past,\npresent, and future, can be described and (in principle) explained in\npsychology. But Einstein thought that these scientific descriptions\ncannot possibly satisfy our human needs; that there is something\nessential about the Now which is just outside the realm of science. We\nboth agreed that this was not a question of a defect for which science\ncould be blamed, as Bergson thought. I did not wish to press the\npoint, because I wanted primarily to understand his personal attitude\nto the problem rather than to clarify the theoretical situation. But I\ndefinitely had the impression that Einstein\u2019s thinking on this\npoint involved a lack of distinction between experience and knowledge.\nSince science in principle can say all that can be said, there is no\nunanswerable question left. But though there is no theoretical\nquestion left, there is still the common human emotional experience,\nwhich is sometimes disturbing for special psychological reasons.\n\n\nThis difference as expressed here between Einstein and Carnap (that\nis, between the Heraclitean and Parmenidean attitude towards time and\nchange) is the subject of this article, which will use modern\nphysics\u2014especially modern spacetime theories\u2014as a set of\nlenses through which it is hoped the riddles of time will come into\nsharper focus. There are many ways, however, to approach these\nquestions. Early in the twentieth century, Anglo-American philosophy\nturned to consideration of language as a way to clarify philosophical\ndisputes. Philosophers of time debated the relations between and the\nrelative primacy of tensed language (concerning the notions of\npresent, past, and future) and tenseless language (concerning the\nrelations of simultaneity and temporal precedence). Our considerations\nof physics will generally, though not completely, skirt linguistic\ndisputes. The reader interested in following these debates can find a\nuseful introduction in the entry on\n time,\n a classic presentation in Gale (1968), a review and discussion in\nTooley (1999), and Dyke (2007 chapter 3, 2013).\n\nOther philosophers have been influenced by analogies between time and\nmodality. The reader interested in this way of thinking about time\nshould consult the article on\n temporal logic.\n The present article will focus on time in physics and the relations\nbetween time and space. Other philosophical approaches focus on the\nprimacy of experience in our understanding of time. The reader\ninterested in these approaches may wish to consult the entry\n the experience and perception of time.\n2. Newtonian Spacetime\n\nModern physical theories are often formulated in a language that\npermits one to express a variety of different views with respect to\ntime and its relation to space. One can, for example, formulate the\nbasic ideas of classical (that is, Newtonian) physics, the special\ntheory of relativity, and the general theory of relativity in this\nlanguage. For a brief introduction to manifolds and the spacetime\nview, see the section on\n modern spacetime theories\n in the entry on\n the hole argument\n in this Encyclopedia. For more detail with minimal technical demands\nthe reader should see the first four chapters of Geroch (1978) or the\nmore demanding chapter 2 of Friedman (1983).\n\nFor our purposes, the defining feature of a manifold that is a\nNewtonian spacetime is that the temporal interval between any two\npoints or events in the spacetime, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nis a well-defined quantity. This quantity is\nwell-defined in that it does not depend upon point of view, reference\nframe, coordinate system or \u201cobserver\u201d. This quantity,\nthen, is absolute in the sense of being frame- or\nobserver-independent. (In the special theory of relativity the\ntemporal interval between two distinct spacetime points fails to be\nabsolute in this sense.)\n\nIf the temporal interval between two events is 0, then we say that the\ntwo events are simultaneous. This relation of (absolute)\nsimultaneity is an equivalence relation (That is, it is reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive.) that slices (partitions or foliates) the\nspacetime or manifold into mutually exclusive and exhaustive planes of\nsimultaneity. These planes of simultaneity can then be completely\nordered by the relation \u2018is earlier than\u2019 or its converse\n\u2018is later than\u2019.\n2.1 Presentism, Possibilism, Eternalism\n\nThe geometrical structure of Newtonian spacetime reflects the way we\nordinarily think about time and is the proper backdrop for introducing\nthe three major rival metaphysical views of time, as illustrated\nbelow:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Three Metaphysics of Time\n\n\nThe first view, represented on the left, is the ontologically austere\nview called presentism, the view that only the present\nexists. The past has been but is no longer, while the future will come\nto be but is not yet. Note that it is the convention of these diagrams\nthat one spatial dimension is suppressed. The present is actually a\nthree dimensional global slice of the spacetime. Moreover, the\nillustration necessarily represents the spatial extent of the present\nas finite and may suggest that time also has a beginning and/or end.\nThese views are, however, merely artifacts of the representation and\nnot integral to presentism, possibilism, or eternalism. The diagram\nillustrating presentism also has four arrows pointing towards the top\nof the page (conventionally taken to represent the future direction)\nattached to the plane representing the present. These arrows are meant\nto indicate something that is integral to presentism, the idea that\nthe present (and hence the existent) constantly shifts or changes.\nThese arrows represent, then, the dynamic aspect of time called\ntemporal becoming or passage. It is widely thought\nthat the deepest problems in the metaphysics of time concern the\nunderstanding of passage or temporal becoming and its relation to\nexistence.\n\nIn contrast to the radical Heraclitean view of presentism, the\nParmenidean eternalist picture on the far right lacks these arrows and\nindicates that there is nothing more special about the temporal\npresent (the now) than the spatial present (the\nhere). Future and past events at a place, on this view, are\nno more or less real than distant events at a time. The now\nlike the here is a function of one\u2019s perspective,\none\u2019s position in the spacetime, and these positions are\nindicated by the line in the spacetime representing the history of\nspacetime locations of a particular object or person. Such a line is\noften called a world line.\n\nThe middle view, possibilism, is indeed an intermediate view. It is a\npassage view, but it is less ontologically sparse than presentism.\nWhile on this view the future is still merely possible rather than\nactual (hence its name), the past has become and is fully actual. If\none thinks of the future as a branching structure of alternative\npossibilities (as the result, perhaps, of free human choices or\nindeterministic quantum measurements), then one can think of the past\nand present as the trunk of that tree, growing as possibilities become\nactual in the present. This view is also known as the growing\nblock view.\n\nPossibilism seems to capture much of the way we think about time and\nbeing. While the sparse symmetry of presentism is attractive, there\nare many deep asymmetries concerning past and future that it fails to\nreflect. I can easily ascertain, for instance, yesterday\u2019s\nclosing number for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but by no\nefforts, however great, can I now ascertain tomorrow\u2019s close.\nAnd it seems as if my future actions (or certain sorts of quantum\nmeasurements) can actualize some future possibilities as opposed to\nothers, whereas past actions (or the results of past quantum\nmeasurements) seem no longer to admit of past alternatives. Even if\none allows for the possibility of retrocausation, that is, for the\npossibility of an effect preceding its cause in time, it is generally\nheld that a present cause can not change or alter the past. It would\nmerely make the past what it was. (See the entry on\n backwards causation\n for further consideration of this topic.)\n\nEternalism too, prima facie, would seem to have trouble\naccounting for the asymmetries built into possibilism, while also\napparently bearing the burden of an implausible denial of passage. But\nthe first topic to which we shall turn is an argument, prominent in\ntwentieth century philosophy of time, that passage or becoming is a\nself-contradictory idea. If the argument is correct, then neither\npresentism nor possibilism can be correct metaphysical views of time\nand being.\n2.2 McTaggart\u2019s Argument\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, J. M. E. McTaggart (1908)\npresented an argument which purported to prove that time is unreal.\nAccording to McTaggart (1927, pp. 9\u201310):\n\nPositions in time, as time appears to us prima facie, are\ndistinguished in two ways. Each position is Earlier than some and\nLater than some of the other positions\u2026 . In the second place,\neach position is either Past, Present, or Future. The distinctions of\nthe former class are permanent, while those of the latter are not. If\n\\(M\\) is ever earlier than \\(N\\), it is\nalways earlier, But an event, which is now present, was future, and\nwill be past.\n\n\nThe first structure of \u201cpositions in time,\u201d McTaggart\ncalled the B-series. I will assume that McTaggart intended\nthe B-series to coincide with the Newtonian spacetime structure\ndescribed above. McTaggart noted that there was something static or\n\u201cpermanent\u201d about the B-series. If, for example, event\n\\(e_1\\) is earlier than event \\(e_2\\) at some time or other, then one\nmay truly assert at all times that \\(e_1\\) is earlier than \\(e_2\\)\n.\n\nThe dynamic element of time must be represented, in McTaggart\u2019s\nview, by the series of properties of pastness, presentness, and\nfuturity, which (in contrast to the static B-series) are constantly\nchanging. A given event becomes less future, becomes present, and then\nbecomes increasingly past. This latter ever-shifting series McTaggart\ncalled the A-series.\n\nWhile there are many obscurities in McTaggart\u2019s writing, it\nseems clear that his argument that time is unreal runs along the\nfollowing lines:\n\n(1)\n there can be no time unless it has a dynamic element (that is, on\nhis view, unless there is an A-series),\n(2)\n there can be no A-series, because the supposition that there is an\nA-series leads to contradiction.\n\n\nThe contradiction alleged by McTaggart is that:\n\n(A1)\n every event must have many, if not all, the A-properties (or\nA-determinations, as they are sometimes called) whereas,\n(A2)\n since the A-properties are mutually exclusive, no event can have\nmore than one of them.\n\n\nNear the end of a career in which he spent much time and effort in\nthinking about McTaggart\u2019s argument, C. D. Broad (1959, p. 765)\nwrote:\n\nI felt from the first, and still feel, that the difficulty which\narises is (a) embarrassing enough prima facie to demand the serious\nattention of anyone who philosophises about time, and (b) almost\ncertainly due to some purely linguistic source (common, and perhaps\npeculiar, to the Indo-European verb-system), which it ought to be\npossible to indicate and make harmless.\n\n\nBroad\u2019s claim (a) was vindicated by the fact that\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument has received serious attention from most\nsubsequent philosophers who pondered the metaphysics of time. Much of\nthis debate concerns the relative relations of the two series. Is the\nA-series fundamental and the B-series derived from it, or vice versa;\nor does, perhaps, one series supervene upon the other? In the formal\nmode, the questions become whether the B-series may somehow be reduced\nto, may be defined in terms of, the A-series (or vice versa). These\ndebates concern mainly language rather than physics and will not be\nconsidered\n here.[2]\n\nWhat emerges from the McTaggart literature is, first of all, a\ntendency to identify the existence of passage or temporal becoming\nwith the existence of the A-series (that is, to think of becoming as\nevents changing their properties of pastness, presentness or nowness,\nand futurity) and hence the tendency for debates about the existence\nof passage to focus on the merits or incoherence of the A-series\nrather than examining alternative accounts of becoming. (But Cf.\nFitzgerald, 1985)\n\nThere is a contrary tendency amongst those philosophers who take\nmodern physics seriously to be sceptical of entities like constantly\nshifting temporal properties of events, since such properties play no\nrole in modern physical theory. One view, defended by Paul Horwich\n(1987, Chapter 2) and Huw Mellor (1981, 1998), is that even though\nMcTaggart showed that the A-series is impossible, the B-series (that\nis, static classical spacetime structure) suffices for time.\n\nBefore we expand on this theme, though, first a few words about\nBroad\u2019s (b), his suspicion that there is some peculiarity of our\nlanguage(s) that creates or at least reinforces the credibility of\nMcTaggart\u2019s anti-passage argument. Broad suspected that there\nwas a subtle ambiguity in the copula \u2018is\u2019 between tensed\nand tenseless uses, between the uses in, for instance:\n\nIt is raining\n\nand\n\nSeven is prime,\n\nthe former sentence containing a tensed and the latter sentence a\nnon-tensed or tenseless copula. It has been further suggested (Sellars\n1962) that one might understand a non-tensed copula (indicated by\n\u2018be\u2019 rather than \u2018is\u2019) after the following\nfashion\n\n\\(S\\) be \\(F\\) at \\(t\\)\niff \\((S\\) was \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) or \\(S\\)\nis \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) or\n\\(S\\) will be \\(F\\) at \\(t)\\),\n\nwhere the verbs to the right of the \u2018iff\u2019 (a\nlogician\u2019s abbreviation for \u2018if and only if\u2019) are\nusual tensed verbs.\n\nAlternatively, one might think of a tenseless copula as the usual\ncopula stripped of temporal information (Quine, 1960, p. 170, Mellor\n1981, 1998, Chapter 7), just as the usual copula carries no spatial\ninformation. If we indicate this tenseless copula by writing\n\u2018BE\u2019 instead of \u2018is,\u2019 we can say that\n\u2018It BE windy in Chicago\u2019 carries information about the\nplace but not the time of the wind, just as \u2018It BE windy at\nt\u2019 tells us about its time but not its place.\n\nThese distinctions will prove helpful in the subsequent discussion of\nbecoming in modern physics. For the moment, one might note that Broad\ncould argue that McTaggart\u2019s (A1) seems plausible if\nthe copula is understood in some tenseless fashion, whereas\n(A2) is plausible if the copula is tensed. If, however, the\ncopula is not univocal in (A1) and (A2), then\nthere is no contradiction involved in accepting both (Savitt,\n2001).\n\nThe claim that the copula is ambiguous (or more precisely, polysemous)\nhas also been thought to have some implications for the metaphysical\ndispute between presentism and the two non-presentist views sketched\nabove. A number of authors (Meyer (2005), Savitt (2006), Dorato\n(2006), Lombard (2010), and Arthur (2019, section 2.3). See Dolev\n(2007) for a different anti-ontological argument.) have argued that in\norder for there to be a genuine difference between these allegedly\ndistinct metaphysical views, in addition to the suggestive pictures\ndisplayed above there must be some univocal statement or proposition\nconcerning temporal ontology that one side asserts and the other side\ndenies. When the polysemy of the copula (or of the verb \u2018to\nexist\u2019) is taken into account, it has proven very difficult to\nfind a clear example of such a statement or proposition. What many\nphilosophers take to be a profound dispute in the metaphysics of time\nmay well turn out to be a mere verbal tangle. (Putnam (2008), by the\nway, has recently joined these critics: \u201c[T]he question whether\nthe past and future are \u2018real\u2019 is a\npseudo-question.\u201d)\n\nAccording to one author (Sider, 2006), there seems to be disagreement\nconcerning the following assertion: dinosaurs exist. Presentists are\nunderstood to deny this claim, while eternalists are supposed to\naffirm it. If those who endorse the claim understand the verb\n\u2018exist\u2019 to be tenseless and those who deny it take\n\u2018exist\u2019 to be a present tense verb, then both sides seem\nto endorse correct claims. There is in this instance, however, no\nunivocal statement that is being disputed, since \u2018exist\u2019\nis understood differently by the two sides. This observation has led\nmany to try to state a version of presentism that is neither trivial\nnor obviously false and to locate precisely the point at which it\ndiffers from non-presentist views. (See Crisp (2004a,b), Ludlow\n(2005), W\u00fcthrich (2012), Golosz (2013). Tallant (2013) reviews\nseveral such efforts negatively and adds one of his own.)\n\nThe few authors that have approached this debate from a linguistic\nperspective differ on the behaviour of the verb \u2018exist\u2019.\nLudlow (2005) considers both a tensed and a tenseless verb; Stoneham\n(2009) is sceptical with regard to tenseless predication; and Moltmann\n(2013) considers \u2018exist\u2019 only as a present tense verb. It\nis worth noting that he claims that \u2018exist\u2019 functions\nquite differently from \u2018there are\u2019 in that the latter can\nbe used to quantify over past, merely possible, and intensional\nentities whereas the former can not. If his claim is correct, then a\ncommon test sentence for the difference between eternalists and\npresentists introduced in Sider (2006)--There exist dinosaurs--seems\nalmost purpose-built to breed confusion.\n2.3 How (and How Not) To Think About Passage\n\nIf McTaggart\u2019s argument that passage is conceptually absurd or\nself-contradictory fails, philosophers mindful of modern physics are\nstill left with Einstein\u2019s concern that passage and the now,\nwhile deeply embedded in human experience, seem to find no place in\nphysics. One may agree with Carnap above that \u201call that occurs\nobjectively can be described in science\u201d and then argue that\npassage reflects something perspectival or subjective and so is\nrightly omitted by physics.\n\nThe most popular version of this view holds that now is a\ntoken-reflexive or indexical term, like here (Smart 1963,\nchapter VII; Mellor 1981, 1998). Physics is not felt to be incomplete\nbecause it fails to treat hereness. Why should its\nindifference to nowness be of any greater concern?\n\nEarly proponents of this view often claimed that \u2018\\(S\\)\nis now \\(F\\)\u2019 meant \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019s\nbeing \\(F\\) is simultaneous\nwith this utterance,\u2019 a quite implausible claim. A more\nsophisticated version of the view is that the truth-conditions of\nsentences like \u2018\\(S\\) is now \\(F\\)\u2019\ncan be given solely in terms of the\n(tenseless) facts that exist or events that occur at the time of the\nutterance or inscription of the given sentence. One can treat\npast and future in a similar fashion. (Dyke,\n2013)\n\nSmart claimed that excessive attention to the tensed notions of\nnow, past, and future serve to project a \u201csort\nof anthropocentric idea on the universe at large.\u201d(1963, 132)\nBut even if the tensed temporal locutions are anthropocentric and do\nlocate us in the universe, it may still be asked whether\nthese temporal locations are in a static structure, \u201ca\nfour-dimensional continuum of spacetime entities,\u201d (132) or in\nan unfolding or dynamic universe. Smart dismisses this latter view\nbecause, in his view, it involves the obscure or mistaken idea that\nevents \u201cbecome\u201d or \u201ccome into existence.\u201d\nBecoming and passage are mistakes, in his view, and harmful ones at\nthat. Smart writes: \u201cOur notion of time as flowing, the\ntransitory aspect of time as Broad has called it, is an illusion which\nprevents us seeing the world as it really is\u201d (132).\n\nIt will be useful to untangle a couple of ideas that are confounded in\nthese quotes from Smart, with the help of some arguments of (mostly)\nBroad\u2019s (1938, section 1.22 of Chapter 35). First is the idea\nthat time \u201cflows\u201d or, more generally, that passage is\nsomehow to be thought of as like motion. Perhaps time itself somehow\nmoves. Or perhaps, as Broad wrote in a famous passage (1923, 59):\n\nWe are naturally tempted to regard the history of the world as\nexisting eternally in a certain order of events. Along this, and in a\nfixed direction, we imagine the characteristic of presentness moving,\nsomewhat like the spot of light from a policeman\u2019s\nbull\u2019s-eye traversing the fronts of the houses in a street. What\nis illuminated is the present, what has been illuminated is the past,\nand what has not yet been illuminated is the future.\n\n\nThis picture of passage has come to be called the moving\nspotlight view, or just the moving\n NOW.[3]\n\nMotion is one sort of change, change of spatial position with respect\nto time. The motion of time, then, must be change of time with respect\nto \u2026 What? If the answer, by analogy with motion, is\n\u201ctime\u201d, one might be rightly puzzled as to how time (or\nanything else, for that matter) can change with respect to\nitself. Furthermore, if it is just time again, then the ratio of\nthese two quantities expressing the supposed rate of change is a pure\nor dimensionless number if the dimensions of the quantities in this\nratio cancel. (See Price 1996, p. 13.) A pure number is not a rate of\nchange, although it may represent various rates of change (for\ninstance, 30 meters/second or 30 miles/hour). As Price remarks,\n\u201cWe might just as well say that the ratio of the circumference\nof a circle to its diameter flows at \\(\\pi\\) seconds per\nsecond!\u201d\n\nTim Maudlin (2007) has replied to Price that the rate of one second\nper second is a perfectly fine rate. Consider, he says, a fair\nexchange rate (based, say, on purchasing power parity) for currencies.\nThe fair exchange rate for the British pound might, at some time, be\n1.52 US dollars per pound. Similarly, Maudlin observes that the fair\nexchange rate for the US dollar with respect to itself must be 1 US\ndollar per US dollar. \u201cIf you think that this answer is\nmeaningless,\u201d Maudlin writes, \u201cimagine your reaction to an\noffer of exchange at any other rate\u201d (2007, 112).\n\nPrice (2011) has replied to Maudlin by abandoning the claim that the\nunits in \u201cone second per second\u201d cancel, leaving a pure\nnumber. He now insists, rather, that a ratio of a quantity to itself\ncan not be a rate at all. Maudlin\u2019s example only seems to evade\nthis point by supposing a ratio of dollars offered to\ndollars returned. That ratio differs, as he sees it, in an\nessential way from the ratio of one second to one second or, for that\nmatter, from the ratio of one mile to one mile, which are both ratios\nof quantities to themselves. Neither in his view can be a rate, and\nthe former ratio is no more characteristic of time than the latter\nratio is of space. (See also Markosian (1993), Olson (2009), Raven\n(2010), Skow (2012), and Arthur (2019, 134\u201335).)\n\nIf (in order to avoid the apparent collapse of a ratio or rate into a\npure number) the time in the denominator of the ratio expressing the\nrate of time\u2019s motion is held to be a different temporal\ndimension from the one in the numerator, then for it to be a genuine\ntime there will have to be passage in it, requiring yet a third\ntemporal dimension. One can see that we are at the beginning of an\ninfinite regress, unless the third temporal dimension is identified\nwith the first (as in Schlesinger 1980, Chapter II), leaving us still\nin the uncomfortable position of having two temporal dimensions. It\nseems at best heroic, at worst hopeless, to try to understand passage\nas a kind of motion.\n\nBroad thought that trying to explain or represent passage in terms of\nqualitative change was \u201cdoomed to failure.\u201d A thing or\nsubstance, \\(S\\), can change in terms of a quality or\nproperty if property \\(P_1\\) and property \\(P_2\\) are determinates\nunder a given determinable and \\(S\\) is \\(P_1\\) at\n\\(t_1\\) but \\(P_2\\) at \\(t_2\\). The passage of time, then, is to be\nthought of as an event\u2019s having (say) the property of\npresentness and then immediately losing that property but gaining (and\nlosing in turn) a long and possibly endless series of properties of\nthe increasing degrees of pastness.\n\nIn order for a thing to change from having \\(P_1\\) at \\(t_1\\) to\nhaving \\(P_2\\) at \\(t_2\\) it must evidently persist at least from\n\\(t_1\\) to \\(t_2\\), but the events usually supposed in discussions of\npassage are instantaneous events, which have no duration at all. They\ncan not undergo qualitative change. It is sometimes argued that the\nproperties that make up the A-series (and so change of which\nrepresents passage) are special properties, which even instantaneous\nevents can gain and lose, but this is special pleading. As noted\nabove, physics has so far no need of such special properties and such\nspecial change and so is unlikely to be sympathetic to this special\npleading.\n\nFinally, Broad notes that (assuming one wishes to think of passage as\nlike qualitative change) the acquisition and loss of (say) presentness\nby an event would itself be an event, a second-order event, in the\nhistory of a first-order event. Since the first-order events are, by\nhypothesis, durationless, it is tempting to suppose that this history\ntakes place in a second temporal dimension. We find ourselves again\nlaunched on what looks to be an infinite regress of temporal\ndimensions.\n\nThese are strong arguments against two perennially tempting ways to\nconstrue temporal becoming\u2014as like motion or qualitative change.\nThey are strong arguments against the existence of temporal becoming\nif there is no other way to understand it. Broad thought, however,\nthat he had a third way. Having pointed out the superficial\ngrammatical similarity between \u2018\\(E\\) became\nlouder\u2019 and \u2018\\(E\\) became present\u2019,\nBroad said that our understanding of these two kinds of assertions\nneed not be dictated by it. He wrote (1938, p. 280\u20131):\n\nAgain, any subject of which we can significantly say that it\n\u201cbecame louder\u201d must be a more or less prolonged\nnoise-process, which divides into an earlier phase of less loudness\nadjoined to a later phase of greater loudness. But a literally\ninstantaneous event-particle can significantly be said to\n\u201cbecome present\u201d; and, indeed, in the strict sense of\n\u201cpresent\u201d only instantaneous event-particles can\nbe said to \u201cbecome present\u201d. To \u201cbecome\npresent\u201d is, in fact, just to \u201cbecome\u201d, in an\nabsolute sense; i.e., to \u201ccome to pass\u201d in the Biblical\nphraseology, or, most simply, to \u201chappen\u201d. Sentences like\n\u201cThis water became hot\u201d or \u201cThis noise became\nlouder\u201d record facts of qualitative change. Sentences\nlike \u201cThis event became present\u201d record facts of\nabsolute becoming.\n\n\nThe terminology may be pretentious, but the idea is simple. Absolute\nbecoming is just the happening of events. The raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre, the very being or existence of events, is in\ntheir happening (at some place and time). If one is willing to embrace\nthis category of entity at all, then one has the tools for a\nminimalist understanding of passage. Given the geometric richness of\nNewtonian spacetime, we can say that some events occur at the same\ntime and so form a class of simultaneous events. These classes can be\nordered by their times, so we can say that some events occur before or\nafter others. The passage of time is then just the successive\nhappening of (simultaneity sets of)\n events.[4]\n It may be this picture of passage that the great logician Kurt\nG\u00f6del had in mind when he wrote (1949, p. 558): \u201cThe\nexistence of an objective lapse of time \u2026 means (or, at least,\nis equivalent to the fact) that reality consists of an infinity of\nlayers of \u2018now\u2019 which come into existence\nsuccessively.\u201d\n\nThere is an ambiguity in this last quote, however, that we must note.\nDid G\u00f6del think that the layers of now come into existence (as\nwhat is to be becomes what is now) and then immediately cease to exist\n(as what is now becomes what once was), which is the presentist\nmetaphysics of time? Or did he think that the layers of now come into\nexistence and forever stay in existence, as the possibilist picture\nmaintains? If one\u2019s basic ontology consists of the sort of\nevents characterized above and often invoked in discussions of time,\n(idealized) instantaneous happenings, then the presentist picture\nseems inevitable.\n\nThe metaphysics of time is, however, one of the cross-roads of\nphilosophy where issues intersect. If one thinks of a basic ontology\nconsisting not of events but of substances or continuants, then one is\napt to wonder what it is that makes sentences marking episodes in the\nhistories of such substances\u2014sentences like \u2018\\(S\\)\nis \\(\\Phi\\) at \\(t\\)\u2019\u2014true.\nOne frequent suggestion is that\nthe \u201ctruth-makers\u201d of such sentences are facts, the fact\nthat at \\(t\\), \\(S\\) is\n\\(\\Phi\\). Then one might further note that in the current year, 2021,\nwe can say:\n\nIt is a fact that Mount St. Helens erupted in Washington in\n1980.\nIt is a fact that Justin Trudeau is now Prime Minister of\nCanada.\nIt is a fact that there will be a total eclipse of the sun in the\nUnited States in 2045.\n\n\nThese facts, when compared to evanescent events, seem to have great\nstability, the first one lasting (since it is a fact\n\u2026) at least from 1980 till the present. The third one is,\nhowever, a special sort of fact, clearly not dependent on human will\nor choice and almost certainly not dependent upon any quantum\nmeasurements either. Future facts that do depend upon human choice or\nquantum measurement, should they be facts now, would seem to constrain\nhuman choice or quantum measurement in ways that many philosophers\nfind undesirable. It is easy to convince oneself, then, that future\nfacts of those two sorts can not really be part of the existing.\nPerhaps, then, facts like fact 3 above can be argued away as well. The\nresult of this (lightly sketched) train of thought is, of course, the\npossibilist picture of time.\n\nIt seems unlikely that a simple argument will decide between these two\nmetaphysical pictures of time, presentism and possiblism. Showing that\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument is flawed, because it relies on an\nambiguity in the copula \u2018is\u2019, and that there is a way to\nconstrue passage that side-steps the traditional objections, moreover,\ndoes not show that eternalism is false but only that it is optional.\nIn Newtonian spacetime it may appear implausible, but it may fare\nbetter when we turn to Minkowski spacetime.\n3. The Special Theory of Relativity\n\nThe Special Theory of Relativity (Einstein, 1905) was presented as a\ngeometric theory of spacetime in Minkowski\n (1908).[5]\n For our purposes, the key change from Newtonian spacetime to\nMinkowski spacetime is that in the latter it is no longer the case\nthat the temporal interval between any two points or events in the\nspacetime, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), is a\nwell-defined quantity. In fact, the temporal interval between two\npoints in the spacetime (and hence the simultaneity of two points in\nthe spacetime) is not defined at all until a coordinate system or\nframe of reference (with some arbitrarily chosen spacetime point as\norigin of the frame) is chosen. A peculiar feature of special\nrelativity (as opposed Newtonian physics) is that each inertial frame\ndefined by an \u201cobserver\u201d passing through the chosen origin\nand moving with some constant non-zero velocity that is less than the\nspeed of light (the only coordinate systems or frames of reference\nthat will be considered in our discussion of the special theory) picks\nout a distinct set of points as simultaneous with the origin.\nThis feature of special relativity is called the relativity of\nsimultaneity.\n\nThe relativity of simultaneity is a consequence of two startling\nassumptions. First, each of these \u201cobservers\u201d, no matter\nat what (subluminal) speed or in which direction they or the source of\nthe light are moving (as long as neither the speed nor the directions\nchange), must come to the same result (conventionally indicated as\n\\(c)\\) when they measure the speed of light. We will not attempt to\njustify the assumption of the constancy of the speed of light here,\nthough many standard texts present the empirical and theoretical\nbackground that led to it. Nor is it obvious that this assumption\nleads to the relativity of simultaneity, though one of the joys of\neven elementary presentations of the subject is that this prima\nfacie astonishing connection can be convincingly demonstrated to\npersistent non-specialists.\n\nThe second assumption typically made in presentations of the special\ntheory is the Principle of Relativity: All inertial frames\nare completely equivalent for the formulation of the laws of\n physics.[6]\n\nA glance back at Figure 1 reminds us that presentism and possibilism\nsuppose that one plane of simultaneity is uniquely metaphysically\nimportant. In the former view, it represents all that exists. In the\nlatter view, it is the locus of becoming, the dividing line between\nthe merely possible future and the actual past-plus-present. The\nspecial theory of relativity tells us that there is an infinity of\nplanes of simultaneity passing through any given spacetime point and\nthat no physical test can distinguish one from amongst the lot. What\nwas supposedly metaphysically distinguished is physically\nindistinguishable. Assuming that we humans are complex physical\nsystems, then we have no way to distinguish the present from\namongst the multitude of putative presents.\n\nAn enthusiast could make much of this fact. For instance, the\nmathematician (and science fiction writer) Rudy Rucker wrote (1984, p.\n149):\n\nAs it turns out, it is actually impossible to find any\nobjective and universally acceptable definition of \u201call of\nspace, taken at this instant.\u201d This follows \u2026 from\nEinstein\u2019s special theory of relativity. The idea of the block\nuniverse is, thus, more than an attractive metaphysical theory. It is\na well-established scientific fact.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the distinguished philosopher and logician Arthur\nPrior thought that the above conclusion showed that special relativity\nis an incomplete view of reality (Prior,\n 1970):[7]\n\nOne possible reaction to this situation, which to my mind is perfectly\nrespectable though it isn\u2019t very fashionable, is to insist that\nall that physics has shown to be true or likely is that in some cases\nwe can never know, we can never physically find out,\nwhether something is actually happening or merely has happened or will\nhappen.\n\n\nWe shall look at more nuanced reactions to the relativity of\nsimultaneity below, but first it will be useful to introduce an\nargument that plays somewhat the same role in Minkowski spacetime as\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument did in Newtonian spacetime. Versions of the\nargument are endorsed in papers by the physicist Wim Rietdijk (1966,\n1976) and the philosopher Hilary Putnam (1967), but the presentation\nhere will be based on an example found in Roger Penrose\u2019s book,\nThe Emperor\u2019s New Mind.\n\nImagine that the Andromeda galaxy, which is about two million light\nyears or \\(2\\times 10^{19}\\) kilometers from Earth, is at rest with\nrespect to Earth. On Earth two friends walk past each other, Alice\nwalking along the Earth-Andromeda line towards Andromeda, Bob walking\nalong that line but away from Andromeda. Each is walking at a\ncomfortable pace, say 4 km/hour. One can calculate that their planes\n(or spaces) of simultaneity at the instant at which they pass each\nother on Earth (Call the event of their meeting \\(\\mathbf{O})\\)\nintersect the history or world line of Andromeda about 5\n\u00be days apart. (Call these two events \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), respectively. We are idealizing Andromeda as a point,\nfor the purpose of this example.) Imagine, finally, that during this 5\n\u00be day period between \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) a\nmomentous thing happens. The Andromedeans launch a space fleet aimed\nat invading Earth.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The Andromedean Invasion\n\n\nThe launch of the invading fleet is prior to \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and so\nin some sense in Alice\u2019s past. But since the launch is\nafter \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), it is in that same sense in Bob\u2019s future.\nPenrose comments:\n\nTwo people pass each other on the street; and according to one of the\ntwo people, an Andromedean space fleet has already set off on its\njourney, while to the other, the decision as to whether or not the\njourney will actually take place has not yet been made. How can there\nstill be some uncertainty as to the outcome of that decision? If to\neither person the decision has already been made, then surely\nthere cannot be any uncertainty. The launching of the space\nfleet is an inevitability. (p. 303)\n\n\nThis is an odd situation indeed. An event in Bob\u2019s future seems\nin some way to become fixed or inevitable by being in Alice\u2019s\npast. But that is not the end of the oddness here. Imagine that at\npoint \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) (where Alice\u2019s plane of simultaneity\nintersects the world line of Andromeda) there is an Andromedean,\nCarol, who is walking directly towards Earth at about 4 km/hour. Then\nCarol\u2019s plane of simultaneity intersects Earth at some point\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) which is about 11 \u00bd days after \\(\\mathbf{O}\\),\nthe meeting of Alice and Bob. If all events (like\n\\(\\mathbf{A})\\) in Alice\u2019s past or present at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\)\nhave happened, are fixed, or are real, then the principle of\nrelativity (the second assumption of the special theory introduced\nabove) suggests that we must also extend the same courtesy to Carol;\nand so simultaneous with the fixed and real event \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\n(Carol\u2019s walking towards Earth at exactly the point at which\nAlice\u2019s plane of simultaneity intersects the history of\nAndromeda) is the event \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) (and so fixed and real), the\nintersection of Carol\u2019s plane of simultaneity with Earth, which\nis in the future of both Alice and Bob. It is easy to see\nthat, by adjusting the speeds of Alice and Carol, any event to the\nfuture of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) can be shown to be fixed or real or\ninevitable. But \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) itself was just an arbitrarily chosen\npoint in the spacetime. \u201cIt begins to seem that if anything is\ndefinite at all,\u201d we might echo Penrose, \u201cthen the entire\nspace-time must indeed be definite! There can be no\n\u2018uncertain\u2019 future.\u201d (p. 304)\n\nRoberto Torretti (1983, p. 249) calls the resulting view of the\ndefiniteness or fixity of all events in the spacetime\nchronogeometrical determinism. A slightly better name might\nbe chronogeometrical fatalism, as we will see below. In order\nto see more clearly, however, what has gone wrong in the argument\nabove, it will be useful first to look more closely at the problems\nattendant upon trying to import our commonsense or classical\nintuitions about time into the understanding of Minkowski spacetime\nand then to describe briefly the structures peculiar to that spacetime\nitself. To begin with the first task, one of the most notable attempts\nto bring our time into Minkowski spacetime is to be found in Sellars\n(1962), a determined attempt by one of the most profound systematic\nmetaphysicians of the latter half of the 20th century.\n3.1 Relativizing the Present\n\nWilfrid Sellars\n believed that the various invariant or observer-independent\nelements of Minkowski spacetime (like the light cone structure to be\ndescribed below) that are typically given primary consideration in\ntreatments of relativity from a spacetime perspective are abstractions\nfrom and secondary to the \u2018perspectival\u2019 pictures or\nperspectives, the myriad of inertial systems or reference\nframes. When it comes to time, however, he believed that there is\nsomething even more fundamental than these perspectives:\n\n\u2026we must distinguish between a moment, t, and the event of the\nmoment\u2019s being present with respect to a given perspective and,\nabove all, between the event of the moment\u2019s being present with\nrespect to a given perspective and the event of the moment\u2019s\nbeing present. The latter, of course, is the essential\nfeature of a temporal picture of the world. (577)\n\n\nWhile there is in Sellars\u2019 paper a lengthy and illuminating\nseries of reflections on the relation between events, facts, and\nsubstances, there is no guidance offered on the relation between a\nmoment\u2019s being present with respect to a given perspective and a\nmoment\u2019s simply being present, a concept which is ill-defined\nfrom a relativistic point of view. If this latter is indeed an\nessential feature of a temporal picture of the world, then it would\nseem that special relativity does not provide us with a temporal\npicture of the world. If on the other hand the world is\nfundamentally temporal in the way that Sellars insists it must be,\nthen (at least as far a special relativity as a representation of that\nworld is concerned), Sellars\u2019 famous scientific realism is\ncompromised because what he deems for metaphysical reasons to be an\n\u2018essential feature\u2019 of a temporal picture of the world\ndoes not appear in a fundamental theory of spacetime.\n\nThere are some useful lessons to learn from the failure of this\nattempt to import pre-relativistic temporal categories (like simply\nbeing present as opposed to present with respect to an inertial frame)\ninto Minkowski spacetime. First, Sellars is careful to distinguish\nbetween events as things that happen or occur or take place and the\n\u2018events\u2019 (the use of single quotes is Sellars\u2019) that\nare basic in relativity. The latter are just spacetime points. They do\nnot take place or occur, and they are not the relata in causal\nrelations, whereas events are. (But cf. Tooley (1997, Chapter 9))\n\nSellars also presents a distinction between what he calls (p. 586)\ncategorial existence statements and what, for lack of a\nbetter term, I will call non-categorial existence statements.\nThe former invoke frameworks, like the framework of substances or the\nframework of \u2018events\u2019, the frameworks that Sellars takes\ngreat pains to compare in his essay. He is inclined towards a view he\nattributes to Carnap (1950) that to say that, for instance,\n\u2018Things exist\u2019 is to make the categorial, metalinguistic\nclaim that there are thing words in our language L now. This use of\n\u2018exist,\u2019 claims Sellars, has no (future or past) tensed\ncontrast.\n\nNon-categorial existence statements, on the other hand, assert the\nexistence of individuals or less general kinds in a fully tensed\nfashion. Sellars would construe them in the following way (p.\n592):\n\n\\(a\\) be existent \\(\\{\\) before now,\nnow, after now \\(\\} \\equiv\\)\n\n\\(\\exists x(x\\) be \\(\\{\\) before now, now, after\nnow \\(\\}\\) and \\(x\\) be \\(\\Phi_1\n,\\ldots ,\\Phi_n\\) and\n\n\u2018\\(\\Phi_1\\)\u2019, \u2026, \u2018\\(\\Phi_n\\)\u2019 be our\ncriteria now for [being] \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019)\n\n\nLeaving aside Sellars\u2019 idiosyncratic way of construing existence\nstatements, if a distinction between categorial and non-categorial\nexistence claims can be made, then it would be perfectly coherent to\nindicate that one is adopting or working in the framework of\n\u2018events\u2019 by asserting that \u2018events exist\u2019\n(tenselessly, in the categorial sense) without being committed to the\n\u201ctenseless existence\u201d of particular events which may be\npast, present, or future (in the non-categorial sense).\n\nIt has sometimes been thought that commitment to a spacetime\nframework, as is often explicit in treatments of special (and general)\nrelativity, is tantamount to commitment to eternalism or the\n\u2018block universe\u2019, since to say that spacetime points exist\nseems inconsistent with saying that some spacetime points are future\nand so do not exist yet or are past and so exist no longer.\nIf some distinction of the type just sketched can be made\nbetween categorial and non-categorial existence statements, then\neternalism is not a straightforward consequence of adopting the\nspacetime\n viewpoint.[8]\n One can consistently affirm the category of events without also\naffirming that particular events exist (occur, happen) now or at any\nother specified time. (See \u00a73.4 of Arthur (2019) for more\ndetail.)\n\nGranting Sellars all the distinctions that he wishes, however, does\nnot give him the tools to avoid the central problem sketched above.\nSince the problem is, in one form or another, the problem that any\nview that tries to define a notion of temporal becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime must address, it is worth examining it a bit more closely.\nSellars wrote (p. 591):\n\n\u2026 in the case of an \u2018event\u2019 framework, a primary\ntemporal picture is a picture with a now. And even if one\nobserver\u2019s now is another observer\u2019s\nthen, or one observer\u2019s simultaneous cross sections of\nthe world are another observer\u2019s sets of differently dated\n\u2018events\u2019,\u2026 each of their now-pictures is a\nprimary picture, and the purely topological picture (which includes\nthe measurements performed by \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) as\ntopological facts) which is common to them is not the primary\npicture of the world construed as a system of\n\u2018events,\u2019 but merely a topological abstraction common to\nthe various primary pictures; and the topologically formulated\nlocation of individual events in the topological picture is merely the\ntopologically invariant features of the criteria which identify these\n\u2018events\u2019 in a primary picture.\n\n\nIn this quote Sellars is using the term \u2018topological\u2019\nwhere one would now normally use the term \u2018geometric\u2019, and\nhe is forcefully reiterating his view that the spacetime manifold of\n\u2018events\u2019 is merely an abstraction from the infinity of\ndistinct primary now-pictures of individual observers.\n\nThe first question one will surely want to ask about this view is: how\ncan an infinity of distinct \u201cnow-pictures\u201d each\nbe primary? No answer is forthcoming. The second, and more troubling\nquestion, is: how can this infinity of distinct\n\u201cnow-pictures\u201d be related to the traditional metaphysical\nviews under discussion? What, in short, is the connection (if any)\nbetween the temporal notions implicit in each of the pictures and\nexistence of the past, present, and future? The striking fact about\nSellars\u2019 schema above for \u2018a be existent\nnow\u2019 is that it is not relativized to a\nreference frame, inertial system or \u201cperspective\u201d and so\nis not meaningful relativistically. The definition gives us no\nguidance as to how to parcel out existence to elements in the infinity\nof inertial frames that are admissible at a spacetime point.\n\nIf the definition or schema above were relativized to inertial frames\n\\(F, F'\\), etc., so as to connect existence to relativistically\nacceptable \u201cprimary now-pictures\u201d, its interpretation\nwould be either unhelpful or mysterious. Consider the following\nmodification of Sellars\u2019 schema above:\n\n\\(a\\) be existent now in \\(F \\equiv\\)\n\n\\( \\exists x(x\\) be now in \\(F\\) and\n\\(x\\) be \\(\\Phi_1 ,\\ldots \\Phi_n\\) and\n\n\u2018\\(\\Phi_1\\)\u2019,\u2026,\u2018\\(\\Phi_n\\)\u2019 be our\ncriteria now for \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019)\n\nSuppose it is not the case that \\(a\\) be existent\nnow in some other frame \\(F'\\). It seems as if this\ndifference must result from \\(a\\)\u2019s being\nsimultaneous with some spacetime point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), say, in \\(F\\)\nwhile not being simultaneous with the same point\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) in \\(F'\\). But on this reading Sellars\u2019 schema is\njust a round-about way to indicate that simultaneity is\nrelative\u2014the point of departure for our metaphysical questions\nrather than the answer to any.\n\nThe schema looks as if it is meant to do something more, to connect\ntemporal notions to existence. But if so, how is existence relative to\na frame to be understood? Classical presentism, for instance, wishes\nto identify existence with present existence or existence\nnow. Since the present is relativized to frames in special\nrelativity, may not existence be relativized to frames as well? This\nis a difficult notion to understand or accept. Kurt G\u00f6del (1949,\np. 558) said flatly, \u201cThe concept of existence \u2026 cannot\nbe relativized without destroying its meaning completely.\u201d Is\nthe concept of existence, then, like the concept of truth, which, when\nrelativized (as true-for-me, true-for-you), comes to something more\nlike belief than truth? Or is it like simultaneity, about which\nthoughtful persons a century or so ago might have made pronouncements\nmuch like G\u00f6del\u2019s? This difficult and fundamental question\nhas by no means been resolved.\n\nWere this question resolved in favor of the relativization of\nexistence, what would be the import of a relativized version of\npresentism? It would have to hold that what existed changed radically\nwith one\u2019s state of motion. Certain events (say on Mars or a\nplanet orbiting a distant star) may be existent for you now, sitting\nat your computer screen or reading a printout, but other events will\nreplace those as existent should you decide to walk one way or\nanother. This seems (once again) less like an interesting metaphysical\ninsight than a restatement of the relativity of simultaneity.\nPossibilism is not better off in this regard, for it relies on a\nmetaphysically distinguished present to separate the real from the\npotential. (See the symposium \u201cThe Prospects for the Present in\nSpacetime Theories\u201d in Howard (2000) for further arguments and\nreferences.)\n\nTo sum up, then, Sellars\u2019 attempt to tie existence to temporal\nnotions, when properly relativized, is either a bland re-statement of\nwhat special relativity tells us already about simultaneity or an\nopaque statement about relativized existence. This dilemma confronts\nany attempt to import pre-relativistic temporal notions into Minkowski\nspacetime, such as that in \u00a75.7 of Dolev (2007), though Dolev\nexplicitly eschews ontologizing temporal relations. Let us, then, turn\nto efforts to understand Minkowski spacetime in a different way,\nefforts that will help clarify the puzzling argument about the\nAndromedean invasion presented above.\n3.2 Chronogeometrical Fatalism Again\n\nWe have said much about the relativity of simultaneity but little\nabout the invariance of the speed of light. We now rectify that\nsituation.\n\nImagine that at some point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) of the spacetime an\nidealized point-sized flashbulb flashes for (literally) an instant. It\nfollows from the invariance of the speed of light in all directions\nthat Alice, passing through \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) as above, will find herself\nat the center of an expanding sphere of photons. The radius of the\nsphere expands with speed \\(c\\). (It follows that Bob,\nalso passing through \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) but moving with some constant\nvelocity with respect to Alice, must find himself also at the center\nof such a sphere, even though he and Alice are moving away from each\nother. Such is relativistic life!) If we try to diagram this\nsituation, it is helpful to suppress one spatial dimension, as we have\nin all the figures above, and so the two-dimensional cut through the\nexpanding sphere looks like an expanding circle, which becomes a cone\nwhen that growth is plotted vertically up the diagram (and so is\ncalled the light cone.) More precisely, this figure is just\nhalf the light cone. If two photons (restricting ourselves to two\ndimensions now) converged on point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) from opposite\ndirections, the lines indicating their histories would mark the other\nhalf, the past lobe, of the light\n cone.[9]\n\nLight cones exist at each point of the spacetime and are invariant\nstructures. Since the speed of light is an invariant quantity, all\n\u201cobservers\u201d agree as to which points of the spacetime are\nilluminated by the popping of the flashbulb at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\nFurthermore, as special relativity is standardly understood, the speed\nof light is a limiting speed. No material particle can be accelerated\nfrom a speed less than \\(c\\) to a speed equal to or\ngreater than \\(c\\). Electromagnetic radiation\n(including light) always propagates in a vacuum at speed \\(c\\).\n(To see why \\(c\\) is held to be\nlimiting speed, see Mermin (1968, Chapter 15) and Nahin (1999, pp.\n342\u2013353 and Tech Note 7.) Given these suppositions, the light\ncone structure divides all spacetime into three distinct sorts of\nregions relative to each spacetime point \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). (See chapters\n5 and 6 of Geroch (1978) for a thorough discussion.)\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Light Cone\n\n\nFirst, there are the points from which a photon (travelling at speed\n\\(c\\), of course) may reach \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) or which\n(like \\(\\mathbf{A})\\) may be reached by a photon from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\nWe say that these points are lightlike separated from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\n\nSecond, there are the points inside (rather than on) the future or\npast light cone of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). We say that these points are\ntimelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is\na point in the spacetime timelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and\nfuture to it (that is, inside \\(\\mathbf{O}\\)\u2019s future light\ncone), then a material particle travelling at some relativistically\nacceptable speed (that is, less than \\(c)\\) can travel from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Similarly, a material particle at a\npoint like \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) inside the past light cone of\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\), can travel at some speed less than \\(c\\)\nfrom \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{O}\\).\n\nFinally, there are the points of the spacetime that are neither in nor\non the light cone of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). We say that such points are\nspacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is\nspacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), then neither a light signal\nnor a material body can travel from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)\nor vice versa, because such travel would require superluminal\nspeed. If one makes the natural assumption that information and causal\ninfluence are propagated by electromagnetic signals and material\nparticles, then if \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is spacelike separated from\n\\(\\mathbf{O}\\), events or occurrences at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) can have no\ncausal influence at all on events at \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), and vice\nversa.\n\nWe have reached this last conclusion by means of quite straightforward\nreasoning from the invariance of the speed of light. But consider the\nfollowing observation of Torretti (1983, p. 247):\n\nBefore Einstein \u2026 nobody appears to have seriously disputed\nthat any two events might be causally related to each other,\nregardless of their spatial and temporal distance. The denial of this\nseemingly modest statement is perhaps the deepest innovation in\nnatural philosophy brought about by Relativity. It has completely\nupset our traditional views of time, space, and causality \u2026\n\n\nAs one illustration of how our traditional views of time and causality\nare upset by restricting the propagation of causal influence to the\nlight cone structure, let us revisit the reasoning of the example of\nthe Andromedean invasion that we used to illustrate and motivate\nchronogeometrical fatalism. We may be able to see now that this\nreasoning is not so compelling as it first seemed, and we may be able\nto see why some philosophers have proposed that we look at becoming in\nMinkowski spacetime in a way quite different from the traditional\nway.\n\nTo make the exposition easier, let us add to the story of the\nAndromedean invasion a fourth \u201cobserver\u201d, Ted, who is at\nrest with respect to Earth (and so also Andromeda) at the spot where\nAlice and Bob meet. Ted too defines an inertial frame, and there is a\npoint at Andromeda (We can call it \\(\\mathbf{D})\\) that (in\nTed\u2019s frame) is simultaneous with the meeting of Alice and Bob\nand Ted. To make our exposition easier still, let us suppose that\nAlice and Bob and Ted set their clocks to read 0 at the instant at\nwhich they all\n meet.[10]\n Let us focus on \\(\\mathbf{D}\\).\n\nTed (at the meeting of Alice and Bob) assigns to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) the\ntime 0, since it is simultaneous (in his frame) with his time 0. Alice\nassigns \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) (roughly) the time \\(-3\\) days, whereas Bob\nassigns it time (roughly) \\(+3\\) days. \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is, of course,\nspacelike separated from \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), and we have been at pains to\nexplain that from a special relativistic standpoint this spacelike\nseparation precludes the (physical) possibility that there is any\ncausal influence upon \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) of the events at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\),\nor vice versa. Once the labelling of spacetime points like\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) with coordinates is complete, what further content is\nthere, what further could be meant, by adding that for Alice and Ted\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is real or fixed? Or that for Alice it is past whereas\nfor Bob it is future? If there is indeed no further content, then what\npossible implications with regard to \u2018reality\u2019 or\n\u2018fixity\u2019 or \u2018determinateness\u2019 or\n\u2018tense\u2019 can be drawn from the fact that Bob labels this\npoint with a positive number, Alice labels it with a negative number,\nand Ted labels it with\n 0?[11]\n\nAny good text in special relativity will sooner or later prove that\nfor any pair of spacelike separated points (but let us\ncontinue to call them \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D})\\) there is\nprecisely one admissible inertial frame (with \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) as\norigin) in which \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) are simultaneous,\nan infinity of admissible inertial frames in which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is\nassigned a positive number (that is, in which \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) occurs\nbefore \\(\\mathbf{D})\\), and an infinity of other admissible inertial\nframes in which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is assigned a negative number (that is,\nin which \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) occurs before \\(\\mathbf{O})\\). What\nmetaphysical significance could be gleaned from the fact that some\n\u201cobservers\u201d (the usual anthropomorphized way to refer to\nadmissible inertial frames) at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) must assign positive\ntimes, some negative times, and one time 0 to the distant event\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\), which, again, can not be influenced by and can not\nitself influence the events at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\), according to special\nrelativity at least?\n\nInability to provide any positive answer to this question can motivate\na different approach to conceptualizing becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime, an approach presented by the philosopher Howard Stein\n(1968, 1991). The basic idea of this approach is to begin from or to\ndefine concepts in terms of the geometric structure intrinsic to the\nspacetime rather than in terms of coordinates. In the present case,\nthis approach leads one to try to define \u2018becoming\u2019 in\nterms of spacetime points and light cones. Pre-relativistically,\n\u2018has become\u2019 is defined relative to a plane of\nsimultaneity. We have seen the limitations of the notion of a plane of\nsimultaneity in special relativity in our discussion of the relativity\nof simultaneity. Stein begins, then, by proposing that one define the\nrelation of \u2018having become\u2019 or \u2018already\ndefinite\u2019 with respect to spacetime points. A two-place relation\nschematically written as \\(Rxy\\) will be intended to capture the idea\nthat point \\(y\\) has already become or is definite with\nrespect to point \\(x\\).\n\nThere are two other formal features that this relation \\(R\\)\nshould possess. It should be\ntransitive\u2014that is, if \\(z\\) has already\nbecome with respect to \\(y\\) and \\(y\\)\nhas already become with respect to \\(x\\), then it seems\nreasonable to require that \\(z\\) has already become\nwith respect to \\(x\\). It should also be\nreflexive\u2014that is, is seems reasonable to require that\n\\(x\\) has become with respect to \\(x\\)\nitself. (We can indicate these conditions briefly as (1) \\(Rzy\\) and\n\\(Rxz\\) entail \\(Rxy\\), for all \\(x, y, z\\) and (2) \\(Rxx\\), for all\n\\(x\\).)\n\nFinally, Stein proposes that the relation \\(R\\) not\nhold between every two points in the spacetime. That is, he proposes\nthat given some choice of spacetime point \\(x\\), there\nis at least one distinct point \\(y\\) that has not\nbecome, that is not already definite, with respect to \\(x\\).\nBut is there a relation that has all these\nintuitively desirable characteristics? The answer is yes. The\nrelation is that between a point \\(x\\) and each point\nin or on its past light\n cone.[12]\n If one can accept that the relation \\(Rxy\\) represents in special\nrelativity the notion of becoming (or, having become), then the\nexistence of the relation specified and found by Stein is a formal\nrefutation of the Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument for chronogeometric\nfatalism.\n\nThat chronogeometric fatalism (or, the block universe) is refuted is,\nof course, controversial. Is the relation that Stein calls\nbecoming, or having become, a genuine notion of becoming in Minkowski\nspacetime? Stein points out that if its true for his relation R that\nthere is even one point or event x such that there is another point or\nevent y such that both Rxy and Ryx are true, then R must be the\nuniversal\n relation.[13]\n That is, it would follow that Rxy for all x and y. If, then, one\nthinks of the present as a set of events that have become for each\nother but that not all events have become, then it follows that\n\u201cin Einstein-Minkowski space-time an event\u2019s present is\nconstituted by itself alone.\u201d (Stein, 1968, p. 15)\n\nIs this an acceptable view? Callender (2000, S592) remarks that\nrequiring that an event\u2018s present must contain at least one\nevent distinct from it, which he calls the non-uniqueness\ncondition, \u201cseems the thinnest requirement one might put on\nbecoming.\u201d He would then not accept Stein\u2019s relation \\(R\\)\nas representing a genuine relation of becoming since\nit fails to meet this condition, but then he also must accept the\nconclusion of the Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose argument, since the only\nalternative to \\(R\\) is the universal relation. If one\nwishes to evade chronogeometric fatalism, as far as the special theory\nof relativity is concerned, then it seems there is no alternative to\naccepting Stein\u2019s relation \\(R\\) as representing\na genuine relation of becoming and to considering that an\nevent\u2019s present is constituted by itself alone. It is a truism\nthat the relativistic revolution in physics has profound implications\nfor our concepts of space and time. This last dilemma supports that\ntruism.\n\nThere may seem to be another obstacle to accepting Stein\u2019s\nrelation \\(R\\) as representing a genuine relation of\nbecoming. \\(R\\) is supposed to represent becoming, but\nthe light cone structure of Minkowski spacetime, in terms of which it\nis defined, is inert. This reaction was voiced, for instance, by Palle\nYourgrau, who wrote that \u201cStein\u2019s mistake is to adduce a\nstructural property as what \u2018justifies the use of our\nnotion of \u201dbecoming\u201c in relativistic\nspacetime.\u201d\u2019 (1999, p. 77) If Yourgrau has put his finger\non a \u201cmistake\u201d, then it is a \u201cmistake\u201d at the\nvery heart of Stein\u2019s effort. There are, however, a few remarks\nto be made on this score.\n\nFirst, there have been attempts to articulate positions like\nStein\u2019s that try to account for passage in terms of geometric\nstructure and that seem to incorporate more dynamic elements,\nexploiting the fact that persistent objects or substances (including\n\u201cobservers\u201d) are represented by timelike world lines,\nrather than by points. The mathematician G. J. Whitrow (1980, p. 348)\nwrote:\n\nAt a given instant \\(E\\) on the world line of an\nobserver \\(A\\) (who need not be regarded as anything\nmore than a recording instrument), all the events from which \\(A\\)\ncan have received signals lie within the\nbackwards-directed light cone with its vertex at \\(E\\ldots\\) . Signals\nfrom events [outside the light cone at \\(E\\)] can only\nreach \\(A\\) after the event \\(E\\), and\nwhen they do reach \\(A\\) they will then lie within \\(A\\)\u2019s\nbackward-directed light cone at that instant.\nThe passage of time corresponds to the continual advance of this light\ncone.\n\n\nThe physicist-philosopher Abner Shimony, in responding to the claim\nthat special relativity shows that becoming is subjective or\n\u201cmind-dependent,\u201d wrote (1993, p. 284):\n\nSomething fleeting does indeed traverse the world line, but that\nsomething is not subjective; it is the transient now, which\nas a matter of objective fact is momentarily present and thereafter is\npast.\n\n\nIn the felicitous phrase of Park (1971), we have here two different\nsorts of animated Minkowski diagrams. Each seems to involve a\nkind of motion, of the light cone or of the transient now\nadvancing along a world line. Our initial restrictions on accounts of\ntransience inspired by Broad\u2019s arguments above, however, should\nmake us wary of invoking motion to account for passage. Park,\nmoreover, sees no benefit to adding the animation.\n\nI want now to make the vital point that the animated diagram may be\nmore intuitive, or more picturesque, or make better cinema than the\natemporal one, but that it contains no more specific, verifiable\ninformation. All of the science of dynamics, that is, all we know\nabout how complex systems (including ourselves) behave and interact,\nis already represented on the atemporal Minkowski diagram.\n\n\nThe non-animated Minkowski diagram may be \u201cstatic\u201d, but,\nas Park points out, the static diagram represents the\nevolution in (proper) time of systems along their world lines. The\ndiagram, if Park is correct, need not itself be animated to represent\ndynamical phenomena. If Park is correct, then what Yourgrau called a\n\u201cmistake\u201d is in fact a virtue of Stein\u2019s account, a\nfeature and not a bug. Stein makes no attempt to animate his geometric\npicture but leaves whatever transience there may be to reside\nin that which it depicts.\n3.3 Localizing Time\n\nKatherine Brading claimed that with proper attention to the history of\nphysics one can find a satisfying version of presentism that does not\nrequire a global present. If one grounds the unity of objects in\ndynamical laws, as she, invoking DiSalle (2006), claims that Newton\ndid, then she says the present can be viewed as \u201ca\nspatiotemporal region of whatever size is necessary to sustain the\ndynamical system in question.\u201d (2013, 1109) Presents construed\nthis way will typically be larger than a single point but will not\nnecessarily exhaust all of Minkowski spacetime or fall afoul of the\nrelativity of simultaneity.\n\nBut this is a characterization of a relativistic present, not\nrelativistic presentism. Presumably every dynamical system that has\nexisted, does exist or will exist had, has or will have a region of\nwhatever size is necessary to sustain it. Furthermore, it is unclear\nunder what conditions two dynamical systems share a present. Even if\nthey are intuitively spatially close, what sustains one may, or may\nnot, sustain the other. While Brading\u2019s suggestion might be\ndeveloped into a way to define a relativistic present, it may not help\nto define presentism in a relativistic context, as she intended.\n\nLet us now turn to two variants of Stein\u2019s approach\u2014two\nclosely related ways to understand the present and temporal becoming\nin terms of structure intrinsic to Minkowski spacetime. One might see\nthese two views as attempts to capture Shimony\u2019s transience\nwithout animating the Minkowski diagram.\n\nTwo sources of the view are Arthur (2006, and, especially, 2019,\nchapter 5) and Dieks (2006). The latter paper begins by presenting a\nseries of arguments that hyperplanes of simultaneity or global\nnows are not the proper relativistic successors to the common\nsense now.\n\nIn \u00a71 Dieks presents the following argument:\n\n(P1)\n The experiences of observers are of such short duration and\noccupy such a small amount of space that they can, without loss, be\nidealized as point-like. \n(P2)\n Amongst these experiences are those that convince observers that\ntime flows or passes. \n(P3)\n Given the upper limit of speed of propagation of causal signals,\nno event that is spacelike separated from a given event can influence\nit causally. Therefore, \n(C)\n The human experiences that suggest at any given event \\(e\\) in\nthe history of an observer that time flows or passes are invariant\nunder different choices of global hypersurface containing \\(e\\).\n\n\n\nEven if it has no relevance to human experience, can we nevertheless\nchoose our hyperplane of simultaneity (the one orthogonal to\nour world line) as the hyperplane of simultaneity that marks\nthe passage of time? No, Dieks argues in \u00a72 of his paper, for two\nreasons.\n\nFirst, there are too many. Were we inertial observers, then there\nwould be a hyperplane of simultaneity orthogonal to our world line\n(and uniquely definable from our world line using the Minkowski\nmetric). But every inertial world line defines such a hyperplane.\nChoosing a particular one, according to Dieks, \u201cis tantamount to\naugmenting the structure of Minkowski spacetime\u201d (Dieks, p.\n5).\n\nBut, second, there really aren\u2019t any. We are not inertial\nobservers. We are (very nearly) rotating observers, and, as Dieks\npoints out, \u201clocal Einstein synchrony \\((\\varepsilon =1/2)\\) in\na rotating system does not extend to a consistent global definition of\nsimultaneity\u201d (Dieks, p. 6).\n\nPartisans of a global now in Minkowski spacetime face, according to\nDieks, a dilemma. \u201cIf we are not going to refer to the actual\nmaterial worldlines in the universe, but only to the spacetime\nstructure itself, we have insufficient resources to fix a unique set\nof global nows. If we do attempt to rely on the actual material\nworldlines, however, we will not succeed in defining global nows at\nall\u201d (Dieks, p. 7).\n\nAlthough we are jumping ahead of our story, it is worth remarking here\nthat the situation does not improve in the general theory of\nrelativity, as Dieks notes in \u00a73. It has been proposed that the\nmean motion of matter could be used to define a preferred frame that,\nin turn, could be foliated (or sliced) into spacelike hypersurfaces\nthat define a preferred global time. But this procedure would work\nonly at a large scale, wherein there would be an arbitrary element in\nboth determining the scale and the averaging procedure. Should one\nretreat to the use of actual world lines, the rotation problem\nreasserts itself.\n\nTime, in the special theory of relativity, appears in two\nguises\u2014coordinate time, which has held center stage thus far,\nand proper time. The histories of material objects, always moving with\nspeeds less than that of light, are represented in Minkowski spacetime\nby timelike world lines (curves in Minkowski spacetime such that the\ntangent vector at each point is timelike). Timelike world lines can be\nparameterized by a quantity, proper time, which is measured\nby ideal clocks following such world lines.\n\nProper time is path-dependent. If two distinct timelike\nworldlines connect point a to point b, they will in general indicate\ndifferent proper times between these points. On the other hand, proper\ntime is not frame-dependent. It is an invariant quantity (given a\nworldline and the specified points on it). (See pages 73\u201380 of\nGeroch (1978) for an illuminating discussion of the path-dependence of\nproper time.)\n\nThe potential philosophical importance of proper time was first\npointed out, like so much else, in a footnote by Stein:\n\nProper time is not a quantity attached to space-time points or to\npairs of space-time points; it is in this respect a notion utterly\ndifferent from the quantity \u201ctime\u201d or \u201ctime\ninterval\u201d of pre-relativistic theory ... The fundamental\nphysical role of proper time comes from the principle (here stated\nroughly) that whenever a process takes place along a well-defined line\nof space-time (\u201cworld-line\u201d), the time rates in the\ndynamical principles that govern that process are to be understood in\nterms of the proper time along that line (and not in terms of\na \u201ctime coordinate\u201d...) (Stein, 1968, fn 6)\n\nThis idea was adopted by Richard Arthur (1982, 107): \u201cIt is \u2026\nproper time which is understood to measure the rate of\nbecoming for the possible process following this timelike line (or\nworldline).\u201d Arthur (2019) is an extended development\nof this view. The idea was also adopted by Dennis Dieks (1988, 456):\n\u201cOnly time along worldlines (proper time) has an\nimmediate and absolute significance as an ordering parameter of\nphysical processes.\u201d\n\nIn the absence (or, rather, the superabundance) of global\nhypersurfaces, which are defined in terms of coordinate time, becoming\nin Minkowski spacetime may be thought of locally, as the advance of\nproper time along a timelike worldline or, even more basically, as the\nsuccessive happening of events along such a world line. The passage of\ntime or temporal becoming (along a given timelike world line, of\ncourse) will be directly indicated by a clock, albeit an ideal\nclock.\n\nWhat about the present? Dieks proposes that the present should be\nthought of as corresponding to a point (a now-point) and the present\nfor that point is just that point itself (as did Robb (1914, 1921,\n1936) and Stein (1968)).\n\nOne could also allow a present that corresponds to some small length\nof time that humans typically think of as the present\u2014an\ninterval that may range from about .5 seconds to 3 or perhaps 4\nseconds. This is the time it takes to read a sentence or hear a\nmusical phrase and is sometimes referred to as the specious\npresent. If we let T indicate the length of a specious\npresent and we try to follow Stein\u2019s injunction to define\nnotions in terms of intrinsic structure, then Arthur (2006) and Savitt\n(2009) have suggested that the present for a stretch of worldline or\nprocess of length T would be the region of spacetime\ncomprised of the intersection of the future light cone of the point at\nthe beginning of that process and the past light cone of the point at\nthe end of it (assuming the process is or occupies a closed interval).\nThis region is often called a causal diamond. (See Winnie\n(1977) for more on causal diamonds.)\n\nTaken literally, Robb-Stein-Dieks point presents cannot be shared,\nwhich some find an unattractive feature of that view. Causal diamonds,\non the other hand, are surprisingly large. For a specious present of\nlength three seconds, the corresponding causal diamond includes the\nmoon (that is, a contemporaneous bit of the moon\u2019s history). As\nthe length of a specious present shrinks to zero as a limit, the\ncorresponding causal diamond shrinks to a point, regaining the\nRobb-Stein-Dieks view as a limiting case.\n\nDorato and Wittman (2015) take as their starting point \u201cthe\nindisputable fact that we share the \u2018now; despite the\nfact we don\u2019t share a \u2018here\u2019\u201d (2015, 200), but\nthey propose a different structure as a relativistic present at a\npoint, a sphere around that point of at least 40 ms length. (According\nto them, 40 ms is the temporal order threshhold. That is, one\ncannot reliably determine the temporal order of event occurring less\nthan 40 ms apart in time in one\u2019s immediate vicinity. In their\nview, this sets a minimum bound on the length of the perceived or\npsychological present.) They add that \u201c\u2026 passage\nphysically correspond[s] to a succession of spheres\u2026\u201d\n(202)\n\nRovelli (2019, 1330) contrasts \u201cfinite bubble presents\u201d\nwith \u201cdiamond presents\u201d:\n\nEach one of these definitions matches our common sense use of\n\u201cpresent\u201d and \u201csimultaneous\u201d in the everyday\ncontexts. They show that the common usage of \u201cpresent\u201d and\n\u201csimultaneous\u201d is not in contradiction with relativity,\nprovided that it is used within the appropriate approximation and\nwithin the appropriate context. None of them deserves to be charged\nwith ontological weight. (1330\u201331)\n\nIt is also possible to have less geometrically well-defined shapes as\nrelativistic presents, as with Brading\u2019s presents above and\nCallender\u2019s \u201cnow patches.\u201d (2017, 2016)\n\nIn pre-relativistic spacetime (and common sense) it is tempting to\nidentify the passing of time with a succession of presents, as did\nKurt G\u00f6del in the quote from him in \u00a7 2.3 above. So, if one\nthinks of presents in Minkowski spacetime as spheres or causal\ndiamonds, one might try to identify passage as a succession of such\ndiamonds or spheres along each timelike path, as in Dorato and Wittman\n(2015) or Savitt (2009, 2020). It is not easy, however, to order a\nsuccession of such regions of spacetime when their size is variable.\nPerhaps, then, one should not succumb to this temptation. The lesson\nto learn is that temporal concepts that coincide in common sense may\nmore clearly be seen to be distinct when re-considered in more\nmathematically sophisticated spacetime settings.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Arthur, R. 1982. \u201cExacting a Philosophy of Becoming from\nModern Physics,\u201d <em>Pacific Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 63:\n101\u2013110.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006. \u201cMinkowski Spacetime and the\nDimensions of the Present,\u201d in <em>The Ontology of\nSpacetime</em> (Volume 1), D.
