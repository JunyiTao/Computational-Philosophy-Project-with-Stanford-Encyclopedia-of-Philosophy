    "main_text": "Absolute Nothingness: Giving Philosophical Form to the Formless || The \u201cSelf that is not a Self\u201d and the Nothingness of Radical Subjectivity\n3.7 The \u201cSelf that is not a Self\u201d and the Nothingness of Radical Subjectivity\n\nUeda argues that both the ego of the Cartesian cogito, as\nwell as the non-ego (Sanskrit: an\u0101tman; Japanese:\nmuga) of Buddhism, must ultimately be comprehended on the\nbasis of an understanding of the self as a repeated movement\nthrough a radical self-negation to a genuine self-affirmation.\nUeda\u2019s formula for this movement is: \u201cI, not being I, am\nI.\u201d Even when one says \u201cI am I,\u201d if we listen\nclosely there is a pause, a breath, between the first and the second\n\u201cI.\u201d Precisely that opening\u2014which necessarily occurs\nas a moment in the ceaseless movement by which the identity of the\nself is constituted\u2014is the \u201cecstatic space\u201d wherein\nan open encounter with others is possible.\n\nA genuine encounter with another person no longer takes place simply\nwithin my, or your, or even our world-horizon. Ueda uses the greeting\nof the bow as a concrete example to illustrate how mutual\nself-negation\u2014the emptying of all ego-centered presumptions and\nagendas\u2014returns us to a communal place where we, paradoxically,\nshare \u201cnothing\u201d in common. \u201cThere, by way of making\noneself into a nothingness, one returns into the infinite depths of\nthat \u2018between\u2019 where there is neither an I nor a you.\n\u2026 Then, when we rise again so as to come back to life anew and\nface one another, this becomes a matter of, as D\u014dgen puts it:\nthus am I; thus are you\u201d (Ueda 1991, 67; see USS X, 107ff.).\nOpen to others, and to the empty-expanse in which together we dwell, I\nam I (USS X, 23\u201324).\n\nNishitani had earlier used the expression \u201cthe self that is not\na self\u201d to characterize the shared endeavor of Nishida and\nTanabe as that of thinking \u201ca \u2018self that is not a\nself\u2019 turning on the axis of absolute nothingness\u201d (NKC\nIX, 238; Nishitani 1991, 175). The idea of the true self as a\n\u201cself that is not a self\u201d expresses an essential aspect of\nwhat Nishida and other Kyoto School thinkers call\u2014following D.\nT. Suzuki, who in turn gleaned the idea from the Diamond\nSutra\u2014the \u201clogic of soku-hi,\u201d a logic\nof \u201cis and is not\u201d or affirmation by way of negation (see\nNKZ XI, 398\u201399; Nishida 1987, 70; Akizuki 1996, 109\u2013152;\nYusa 2019). Nishida strikingly claims that the self is, at bottom, a\nself-contradiction, and that it can truly be itself only in the\nprocess of thoroughly negating and thus opening itself (NKZ VI, 290,\n377\u201378, 401). The self finds its most originary freedom, and its\nmost open engagement with others, through a radical self-negation\nwhich returns it, not to a higher Will or encompassing Being, but to\nkenotically self-negating absolute nothingness that, in turn, finds\nexpression only in the interaction of truly self-determining\nindividuals. For Nishida, the true individual is an interpersonal\nself-determining focal point of the self-determination of absolute\nnothingness, in other words, an interactive and creative element of a\ncreative world (see NKZ VIII, 343ff.).\n\nNishitani\u2019s first book, The Philosophy of Radical\nSubjectivity, sought a more originary conception of the human\nsubject than had been developed in modern Western philosophy. In\ngeneral, for Nishitani, modern \u201csubjectivity\u201d remains\nbound by a reifying attachment to things and ultimately to the ego.\nNishitani did recognized certain advances in the direction of a truly\n\u201cradical subjectivity\u201d in modern ideas such as that of\nindividual \u201cautonomy.\u201d For example, the Kantian idea of\nthe ethical \u201cperson,\u201d which opens itself to a universal\nstandpoint by way of a negation of the self-will of the ego, suggested\nfor Nishitani a \u201ckind of standpoint of\n\u2018non-ego\u2019\u201d (see NKC I, 60). However, the autonomy of\nthe Kantian ethical subject can also be seen as asserting a sublated\nform of self-will, namely in its will to form as well as to conform to\nthe universal. Nishitani finds profounder intimations of a truly\nradical subjectivity in both Meister Eckhart\u2019s mystical theology\nand Nietzsche\u2019s radical atheism, each of which in its own way\ngoes beyond, or digs beneath, attachments to and sublations of egoity.\nUltimately Nishitani returns to the language of Zen Buddhism to\nexpress his conception of the \u201cradical subjectivity of non-ego\n[muga]\u201d as a \u201csubjective nothingness\u201d\n(shutai-teki mu) (NKC I, 88).\n\nThis radical subjective nothingness is not to be confused with the\nrelative nothingness of a \u201csubjective consciousness\u201d which\nsets itself over against, and objectifies, the world. As with\nZen\u2019s k\u014dan of nothingness (mu), a realization of\nthe radical subjectivity of non-ego (mu-ga) entails breaking\nthrough the dualistic barrier that artificially separates self and\nworld. For Nishitani, this breakthrough is expressed as \u201cthe\nself-awareness of the bottom dropping out\u201d (NKC I, iii). It is a\nradical return, or \u201ctrans-descendence,\u201d to \u201cthe\nbackground of our own selves,\u201d to the Ungrund on which\nwe originally possess \u201cnot a single thing\u201d\n(mu-ichi-motsu) (NKC XI, 243).\n\nWith Nishitani\u2019s conception of a radical \u201csubjective\nnothingness,\u201d understood as a \u201cstandpoint of\nemptiness\u201d realized on the \u201cfield of emptiness,\u201d we\nfind an explicit appropriation of both the psychological and the\nmeontological (or mu-logical) paradigms of nothingness found\nin the traditions of East Asia. The notions of non-ego (muga)\nand \u201cno-mind\u201d or \u201cmind of nothingness\u201d\n(mushin) are thought in terms of the spontaneous openness of\nthe heart-mind that stands within the field of emptiness, an open\nplace which grants beings the free space needed for their unobstructed\n(muge) interactivity.\n\nAs we have seen, Nishida, Nishitani, and Ueda each conceived of\nabsolute nothingness in both an existential and a topological sense.\nAlthough Tanabe eschewed the topological conception of absolute\nnothingness, nevertheless, by understanding both the relative self and\nthe absolute in terms of a ceaseless movement of affirmation by way of\nradical negation, he too, in his own way, philosophically appropriated\nthe East Asian paradigms of psychological and meontological\nnothingness.\n",
