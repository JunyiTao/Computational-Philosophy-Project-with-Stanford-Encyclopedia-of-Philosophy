    "main_text": "Feminist Epistemology and Disability Standpoints\n3. Feminist Epistemology and Disability Standpoints\n\n\nFeminist philosophical work has aimed at repairing the imbalance\nbetween men's and women's concerns and rectifying the negative\ndepictions of traits viewed as female that are found in traditional\nphilosophical positions, paradigms and methodologies.  Feminists have\ntried to remedy a pervasive narrowness in the usual ways of framing\nthose issues philosophers have considered important enough to command\nphilosophical attention and work\u2014that is, in the benchmarks that\nsignal philosophical considerability. To induce change, feminist\nphilosophers have crafted approaches that draw upon the very\nlimitations they encounter when attempting to pursue women's interests\nwithin philosophy. This effort has supplied stimulating ideas to\nphilosophers seeking to import the singular insights and different\nperspectives of other subordinated groups, such as the disabled, into\ncontemporary philosophy to improve its inclusiveness and extend its\nscope. Specifically, disabled people's philosophical interests find\nready-made conveyances in several of feminist thinking's signature\nreforms.\n\n\nFor example, feminist epistemology is a philosophically innovative\nreform movement that can serve as a beacon for the philosophical\ninvestigation of disability, although as of this writing the\nsignificance of disability for an adequate epistemology has not been\nmuch explored in disability scholarship, neither in the philosophical\nstudy of disability or in disability studies generally. Some\nfeminist philosophers (and some feminist psychologists as well) have\nargued that women have ways of knowing that differ from men's.\n(For psychologists, see Belenky et al. 1986 and Tannen 1990; for\nphilosophers, see Code 1991 and Ruddick 1989) Tannen, for\nexample, adduces evidence from sociolinguistic research to argue that\nenvironments conducive to women's learning differ from those\nappropriate for men. More generally, some theorists influenced by\nsuch accounts have characterized women as being alienated, unsatisfied,\nand unconvinced when held to traditional epistemology's paradigm of the\nisolated knower, with its detached, universalizing, and controlling\napproach to knowledge. Dissatisfaction with this kind of view has\nprompted feminist epistemological insights about the possibilities for\nachieving objectivity without insisting that cognition works or should\nwork the same way for everyone, as well as about the importance of\nsituating, contextualizing, and nuancing truths, and about the benefits of\ncollaborative practices of achieving knowledge. (See section 2.\n\u201cSocial Models of Knowers\u201d in SEP entry on Feminist Social\nEpistemology for references.)\n\n\nIn developing their insights, feminist epistemologists have addressed\nthe influence on knowledge of the social situations of\nknowers. Situatedness cannot be just a matter of the social\npositioning of knowers, however, or of their histories or\ncultures. What we know is modulated by how we acquire the elements of\nknowledge, and these processes are shaped by the condition of the body\nas well as by social conditions. Cognitive skills are expressions of\ndevelopment in various areas of the brain, which in turn is responsive\nto the rest of the body. We therefore may expect that people with\ndisabilities, whose bodies diverge from the species-typical kind, also\nsometimes will develop cognitive approaches and abilities that differ\nfrom most other people's. Parenthetically, in one of the exceedingly\nrare instances of a philosopher treating an impairment as something\nother than a deficit, the 18th century experimentalist philosopher\nDenis Diderot investigated blind people's ways of knowing (Diderot\n1999 [1749], Curran 2013). Taking a stance that resembles, if not\nprefigures, recent feminist criticisms of Descartes, Diderot, in his\n\u201cLetter on the Blind for the Use of Those Who See,\u201d describes how\nblind people know about the world to show the short-comings of\nCartesian over-reliance on metaphors that associate reason with light\nor sight and Cartesian reliance on visual rather than tactile ways of\nknowing.\n\n\nTraditionally, of course, philosophers have dismissed disabled people's\nclaims to knowledge about subjects touched by the limitations of their\nparticular impairments. A telling illustration is given in the\ncorrespondence between philosophers Bryan Magee and Martin Milligan, in\nwhich Magee simply dismisses, absent argument, Milligan's report\nand arguments that, although blind almost from birth and without visual\nmemories of experiencing specific colors, he fully understands the\nmeaning of \u201cred\u201d (Magee and Milligan 1996). Here\nMagee portrays Milligan as a defective knower because of his blindness,\na conclusion Magee advances with assertions that Milligan's\nexperiences with redness are not exactly like Magee's own. Yet it\nis tendentious to point out that blind-from-birth individuals do not\ndevelop visual processing skills, and then to intimate that they must\nbe epistemologically inferior to, or that their modes of knowing cannot\nrise to the epistemological significance of, sighted people. To\nthe contrary, in some born-blind people, for instance, the area of the\nbrain associated in most other people with visual processing appears\ninstead to be a site for aural processing, meaning that a much larger\npart of the brain is available for dealing with information obtained\nthrough hearing than is the case for sighted people. This\nbiological difference is thought to explain why in many cultures blind\nindividuals are taken to be endowed with legendary skills for\nremembering and transmitting the spoken word accurately and with\nheightened understanding of orally transmitted texts, Thus blind bards\nwho preserve and perform lengthy gospels or narratives from an\nauthoritative standpoint are familiar figures in the history of many\ncultures (O'Neil 2003).\n\n\nThere are other blind people who know objects in their physical\nenvironment by echolocation, having cultivated the skill of making\nclicking noises with their tongues and identifying the different\nqualities of sounds bounced back toward them (Tresniowski and Arias\n2006 [in Other Internet Resources]; see also \u201cShattering\nBarriers\u201d at the World Access for the Blind website, in Other\nInternet Resources).  Belgium's police force includes blind detectives\nwho can listen to criminals' recorded conversations and by the\nreverberations of sound identify what kind of room they occupy,\nwhether they are using a landline or cell phone, and even what kind of\ncar they are traveling in or whether the suspect's Flemish carries an\nAlbanian rather than a Moroccan accent (Soares 2007). Sighted people's\ntypical lack of functional ability to navigate by reverberated sound,\nand thus their inferior way of knowing the absorption/reflection\nproperties of the physical objects that surround them, and their\ndeafness to nuances of spoken sound, surely should be recognized as a\ndisadvantage.  Yet this is almost never so, even where sighted people\nmust find their way in the dark or distinguish among interlocutors\nbeyond their vision.\n\n\nThe experiences of people diagnosed with cognitive impairments also\nusually are dismissed as epistemologically defective, judged against\nthe philosophical ideal of the rational thinker. Some people\ndescribed as cognitively impaired have anomalous patterns of cognitive\nskills, in some ways failing to attain, but in other ways exceeding,\nlevels typical for the species. For example, individuals with Down\nSyndrome, who think abstractly only with difficulty or not at all,\nsometimes have greater than usual skills in perceiving, and\nremembering, the concrete details of what they see or hear. And people\nwith Williams Syndrome quite often have greater social and emotional\nintelligence than is species-typical for humans, as well as unusual\nmusical facility. This is not even to mention the innovative\ninsightfulness and creativity achieved by individuals with diagnoses of\nvarious kinds of psychoses and similar so-called mental disabilities,\nconditions experienced by many famed artists, writers and\nmusicians.\n\n\nSuch individuals usually are exempted from philosophy's scope as, for\nexample, when epistemological theory discounts the judgments of blind\npeople as irrelevant or unimportant to philosophical accounts of\nempirical knowledge, as philosopher Magee dismisses philosopher\nMilligan.. And people who lack abstract thinking skills, thereby\ndiverging from the kind of human capability philosophers themselves\nexercise so well and enjoy so greatly, usually are dismissed as\nunimportant, that is, as not rising to philosophical considerability.\nPeople whose cognitive anomalies impede them from arriving at and\narticulating complex and rationalized accounts of their own good very\noften are not accorded full status, and sometimes even are denied\nconsiderability, by moral and political theories, including\npluralistic liberal theories committed to respecting citizens' diverse\nvalues. (See McMahan 2005 and Kittay 2005) Yet, as Francis and Silvers\n(Francis and Silvers 2007, Silvers and Francis 2009) have pointed out,\nnormally autonomous individuals do not arrive at, nor do they express,\nnotions of their own good in isolation from, or independent of, their\ninteractions with other people.  Conceptualizations of the good of\ncognitively impaired people, developed through structurally similar\ncollaborative interactions between them and others, deserve equal\nconsideration in moral and political philosophy. \n\n\nTo account for the misfit between philosophical paradigms and their\nrealities, the testimony or example of outliers such as blind people,\nand people with Down Syndrome or Williams Syndrome, typically is\ndisallowed on the ground that it must be inherently flawed where it\nchallenges or deviates from philosophical theory. Yet to disregard the\nstandpoints, and thereby the performances and reports of the\nexperienced world, of unusual people impoverishes philosophizing by\ndiminishing the epistemological adequacy of philosophical accounts.\nFurther, as an application of Miranda Fricker's analysis of epistemic\ninjustice shows, the practice of systematically discounting belief\nclaims made by people with disabilities should be condemned as\ntestimonial injustice: individuals are wronged based on their\ndisability status when they when they aspire to roles as knowers (see\nFricker 2009). Nor, to apply a lesson from feminist philosophy of\nscience, can objective knowledge about disability be produced unless\ndisabled people, including people with cognitive disabilities, are\nfully respected members of the community of inquirers (see Longino\n2001). Francis and Silvers have proposed an approach to constructing\nideas of the good with full respect for and inclusion of the\nviewpoints of severely disabled persons (Francis and Silvers 2006,\nSilvers and Francis 2009).\n\n\nLike disabled people as a group, women as a group have been dismissed\nand displaced, condemned for not complying with biological or social\nparadigms and therefore denied authorization for the ways of knowing\nthat inform their experiences. What they believe they know often has\nbeen rejected as merely epistemologically anomalous. Oppressive\npolicies traditionally were defended with the rationale that\n\u201cnature\u201d has made women physically, intellectually, and\nemotionally frail (Miles 1988). In response, feminist epistemology has\nwelcomed recognition of the legitimate influences of social location\nin arriving at knowledge claims, as well as the centrality of\ncollaborative practices in the pursuit of knowledge. \n\n\nWhat is not so clear is whether feminist epistemology is as\ncomfortable with the impact on knowing of other bodily differences.\nThis is a question of whether different biological properties\nlegitimately define different epistemological standpoints. Especially\nin the last part of the 19th and the first part of the\n20th centuries, biological determinism was a potent tool\nused to oppress women through false testimony that science found them\nto be less capable of survival than men.\n\n\nWary of promoting such determinism, feminist philosophy has been more\nengaged with the social rather than the biological phenomena\nidentified with women. Feminist standpoint theory has been inclined to\ntreat differences in cognitive styles as arising from socially induced\ngendered identities or roles rather than from biological traits or\nconditions that differentiate men from women. Some of its proponents\nargue for the superiority of the styles associated with women. In the\nmain, however, the operative notion for feminist theory is that\nepistemic authority is the product of a social award; there is no\nnatural order in which the cognition of biologically fit individuals\nis most attuned to the actualities of the external world and therefore\nis superior.\n\n\nTo a significant extent, however, standpoints defined in terms of\ndisability are associated with characteristic biological differences. This\nraises several questions for an epistemology of disability, especially\none modeled on feminist theory, to explore.\nFirst, is characterizing standpoints with reference to biological\ndifferences inherently and onerously deterministic, so that one's\nbody inescapably delineates one's cognitive destiny?\nSecond, does granting equal legitimacy to standpoints defined with\nreference to biological differences lead to irresolvable and\ndebilitating epistemological relativism? And, third, will\nacknowledging the range of atypical (for humans) ways of knowing reveal\na heretofore unimagined richness in what humans can know the world is\nlike?\n",
