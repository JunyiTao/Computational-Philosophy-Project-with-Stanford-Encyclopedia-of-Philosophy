    "main_text": "Social Criticism\n4. Social Criticism\n\nFive fragments touch on traditional subjects of Greek sympotic\nverse\u2014on proper conduct at symposia (drinking parties), the\nmeasures of personal excellence, and the existence of various human\nfoibles or failures. Xenophanes appears to have been particularly\ninterested in identifying and discouraging conduct that failed to pay\ndue honor to the gods or posed a risk to the stability and well-being\nof the city (or perhaps both). Although these passages may be\ninsufficiently abstract and demonstrative in character to count as\n\u2018philosophical teachings\u2019, they do represent an important\nbridge between Greek poetry of the archaic period and the kind of\nmoral theorizing practiced by many 5th and 4th-century thinkers.\nXenophanes\u2019 disparagement of the honors accorded to athletes\n(B2), his call to censor the stories the poets tell about the gods\n(B1), and counsel to live a life of moderation (B3 and 5, and perhaps\nB21) all anticipate views expressed in Plato\u2019s Republic\n(cf. 607a, 378b, 372b.) His criticism of the pursuit of useless\nluxuries (B3) also anticipates Socrates\u2019 rebuke of his fellow\ncitizens for caring more about wealth and power than about virtue (cf.\nApology 30b.) His cautionary remarks about knowledge (B34)\nand reminder of the subjectivity of human taste (B38: \u201cIf god\nhad not made yellow honey, they would think that figs were far\nsweeter\u201d) also reflect a traditional view of human judgment as\nlimited and conditioned by personal experience. In each of these\nareas, Xenophanes\u2019 social commentary represents a continuation\nof the Greek poetic tradition as well as a step toward explicit\nphilosophical theorizing.\n",
