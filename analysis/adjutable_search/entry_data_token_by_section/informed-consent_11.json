    "main_text": "Informed consent || Lies, deceit, and partial disclosure\n4.1 Lies, deceit, and partial disclosure\n\nLies about pertinent matters are broadly assumed to violate the\ninformed consent requirement. So does non-lying deceit that\nintentionally prompts a false impression, for example, complete\nconcealment of a potentially despairing prognosis, or its statement in\nobscure Latin terms that the patient cannot understand, in order to\nmaintain the patient\u2019s hope and medical adherence. So does\nnon-lying deceit that is voluntary but unintentional, say an\nexplanation in obscure Latin terms meant only to impress the patient\nbut foreseen to hamper comprehension (Jackson 1991, 6). Interestingly,\nignorance of side effects that results purely from the early stage of\nscientific inquiry into them is taken to permit informed consent and\nautonomous decisionmaking (Millum and Bromwich 2013). A recent\nquestion is how much certain mild forms of intentional\nmanipulation\u2014for example, placing the hopeful news both at the\nbeginning and at the end of a prognostic report so as to make its\naffect more hopeful\u2014invalidate informed consent (Eyal 2016).\n\nThe intentional use of the placebo effect in clinical care, commonly a\ndeceitful means to help a patient feel better, is condemned by\nprominent bioethicists in the name of informed consent (Bok 1999,\n61ff.; Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 125). Other seeming breaches of\nthe information component of informed consent are somewhat more\npopular with bioethicists. First, the well-established\n\u201cnocebo\u201d effect is when the patient\u2019s expectation of\na negative outcome as a possibility generates corresponding symptoms\nor exacerbates them. When a severe, unavoidable nocebo effect from\ndisclosure is predictable, most philosophical observers support\nwithholding certain information (Cohen 2014). In some cultures,\npatients are averse to hearing about risks because they falsely\nbelieve that the mention of remote risks makes those risks likelier to\nmaterialize. While the expectation is false, it means that full\ndisclosure of these risks would meet with aversion, potential anxiety,\nand fewer clinic visits, and many bioethicists permit partial\ndisclosure in such settings (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 106).\nFinally, so-called deceptive studies can begin while the participant\nis waiting in the corridor for what she believes is an altogether\ndifferent experiment, precisely because full disclosure would foil the\ninvestigation. Their deceitful nature notwithstanding, such studies\nare ubiquitous in psychology and some bioethicists find forms of them\nacceptable (but see condemnation in Bok 1995).\n",
