    "main_text": "The Early-Scholastic Tradition || Philip the Chancellor: The First Systematic Treatment of Synderesis and Conscience\n2.3 Philip the Chancellor: The First Systematic Treatment of Synderesis and Conscience\n\nAlthough Stephen Langton was the first scholastic to touch on the\nissue of synderesis in any depth, it was Philip the Chancellor (ca.\n1170\u20131237) who wrote the first treatise devoted to exploring the\nrelationship between synderesis and conscience (Lottin 1948:\n139\u2013157). As chancellor of Notre Dame, Philip had the right to\ngrant the license to teach in the theology faculty at Paris, and it\nwas under his tenure that the Dominicans and the Franciscans acquired\ntheir chairs in theology: two for the former, and one for the latter.\nAlthough primarily an administrator, Philip was also a trained\ntheologian. His most important work is the Summa de bono,\nwhich includes the treatise on conscience.\n\nIn his treatise Philip sets out to answer several questions related to\nthe ontological status of synderesis, to the question of whether\nanyone can sin if they follow synderesis, and to whether it can ever\nbe extinguished. As to the ontological status of synderesis, Philip\ncites Jerome\u2019s authoritative suggestion that synderesis is a\nfaculty or power of the soul. Recall that Jerome had posited a\nquadripartite soul: one that is composed of reason, spirit, desire and\nsynderesis. Since the first three parts of the soul are potentialities\nand synderesis is classified alongside these, it seems to follow that\nit too must be a faculty or power of the soul, distinct from the\nfaculty of reason. Philip cites St. Paul and John of Damascus as\ncorroborating authorities who apparently share the view that\nsynderesis is a faculty of the soul independent of the others (Philip\nthe Chancellor, Summa de bono: Treatise on Conscience; Potts\ntrans. 1980: 95\u201396).\n\nAgainst the claim that synderesis is a power of the soul, Philip\npresents arguments for the view that it is, on the contrary, a moral\nhabit. On this view, synderesis is to the natural will what choice is\nto the deliberative will: a disposition that regulates the rationally\nappetitive powers. But while choice simply regulates the deliberative\nwill with respect to the contingent good, or means towards happiness,\nsynderesis\n\n\nis a disposition arising naturally in conjunction with that\npotentiality by which the natural will is directed to what is good\nwithout qualification. (Summa de bono: Treatise on\nConscience; Potts trans. 1980: 96)\n\n\nMoreover, just as the impulse to sin is distinct from the soul, so too\nis synderesis. But whereas the former inclines the agent towards evil,\nthe latter inclines him towards goodness.\n\nIs synderesis, then, a power of the soul or a habit? This distinction\ngoes back to Aristotle, for whom powers are innate and associated with\nspecific capacities, while habits are acquired and associated, by\ncontrast, with tendencies to behave in certain ways. Habits, moreover,\ninhere in powers. Although both of these properties dispose the agent\nto act in particular ways, powers, in contrast to habits, are linked\nto the ability to do so contingently. If I am in the habit of speaking\nRussian, for instance, then I will have the tendency to do so on a\nregular basis. It is my preferred mode of communication, and I will\ntake every opportunity to express myself in that language. That I may\nhave the mere capacity\u2014or power\u2014to speak Russian, on the\nother hand, having studied it in school, say, in no way ensures that I\nwill do so even in situations where I probably should. I might, for\nexample, hate and resent speaking Russian for various reasons, and\ntherefore freely refuse to do so under any circumstances (see, e.g.,\nAristotle, Metaphysics 9.2, and Potts 1980: 20\u201322).\n\nAlthough Philip seems to favour the belief that synderesis is a habit,\nthe claim that it is a power of the soul has the rather weighty\nauthority of St. Paul and St. Jerome. Philip therefore splits the\ndifference, as it were, and argues that it is a \u201chabit-like\npower\u201d or \u201cdispositional potentiality\u201d\n(habitualis potentiae)\u2014a faculty of the soul that\ndisposes its possessor towards choosing the unqualified\ngood\u2014though one that is innate rather than acquired through\nhabituation:\n\n\nSynderesis, although the morphology of its name makes it\nsound more like a disposition than a potentiality, is nevertheless the\nname of a dispositional potentiality: I do not say of an acquired\ndisposition, but of an innate one. And thus, qua disposition\nit can be applied to what is related to it as a disposition,\nqua potentiality to what is related to it as a potentiality.\nFrom this it follows that it has a certain opposition to free choice,\na certain opposition to the impulse [to sin] and sensuality, and a\ncertain opposition to proheresis, which is part of free\nchoice: qua potentiality, it is disparate from free choice\nand from sensuality, qua disposition it is disparate from\nproheresis and the impulse [to sin]\u2026So, if anyone asks\nwhether it is a potentiality or a disposition, the right answer lies\nin taking something in between: a dispositional potentiality.\n(Summa de bono: Treatise on Conscience; Potts trans. 1980:\n97)\n\n\nIt would seem, then, that synderesis is a potentiality, albeit an\nunusual one. Is it connected to the cognitive side of the soul or to\nthe appetitive? According to Philip, it is related to the appetitive,\nand specifically to the rational appetite, that is, to the will,\nrather than to the sense appetite. However, as we saw, Philip divides\nthe rational appetite into what he calls \u201cnatural will\u201d\nand \u201cdeliberative will\u201d. The natural will signifies the\ngeneral inclination that humans have to the good or happiness as such.\nSuch an object is beyond the scope of choice. Having said that,\nhappiness can be achieved in any number of ways and by the acquisition\nof any number of legitimate, though contingent goods. Indeed, it is\nfair to say that rational agents never choose happiness as\nsuch, given that it is a mere abstraction. Rather, what they\nchoose are particular goods which, taken together, comprise the good\nlife if pursued in an orderly way. Such contingent goods are the means\nto happiness and are the objects of the deliberative will, and\ntherefore choice. Synderesis, according to Philip, pertains to the\nnatural will. It is the remnant of original rectitude or justice\nwhich, although damaged during the fall, remains in the soul in\ndiminished form. As Philip puts it, synderesis is that which\n\u201cmurmurs back against sin and correctly contemplates and wants\nwhat is good without qualification\u201d (Summa de bono: Treatise\non Conscience; Potts trans. 1980: 100).\n\nOn the matter of conscience and how it is related to synderesis,\nPhilip distinguishes them. For one thing, conscience can be mistaken\nwhile synderesis cannot. Specifically, conscience is the result of a\nconcurrence of synderesis with free decision (liberum\narbitrium). Put otherwise, it is the specific application of a\ngeneral moral principle that is the outcome of deliberation. When\ncorrectly applied, conscience is correct. When incorrectly applied, it\nerrs. In either case, the judgement of conscience generates a moral\nobligation to act. Philip uses the following example of how\nsynderesis, which is always right, can nonetheless conjoin with an\nerring conscience (Potts 1980: 104):\n\nUnerring universal premise of synderesis: \u201cEveryone who\nfalsely claims to be the Son of God should be put to\ndeath\u201d.\nErring minor premise of reason: \u201cThis Christ fellow is\nfalsely claiming to be the Son of God\u201d.\nErring judgement of conscience: \u201cTherefore this Christ\nfellow should be put to death\u201d\n\n\nFrom the foregoing example, it is clear that synderesis delivers a\ngeneral, non-deliberative proposition, while conscience yields what\nPotts calls a particular, \u201cdeontic proposition\u201d:\n\n\nPhilip\u2019s argument is [\u2026] that we need to distinguish\nbetween general and particular propositions which\nare of the form: \u201cA ought to \u03c6\u201d where the\nproper name of any person may be substituted for\n\u201cA\u201d and any verb-phrase containing a verb of action\nfor \u201c\u03c6\u201d (I shall henceforth call these \u201cdeontic\npropositions\u201d). (Potts 1982: 690\u2013692)\n\n\nIn the example given above, then, the first, universal premise is\ncorrect (by definition), while the conclusion, as mediated by erring\nreason, generates an incorrect deontic proposition, which is to say,\nan obligation to act, albeit a mistaken one.\n",
