    "main_text": "Multiple Moralities\n8. Multiple Moralities\n\nAnother issue raised by the topic of moral dilemmas is the\nrelationship among various aspects of morality. Consider this\ndistinction. General obligations are moral requirements that\nindividuals have simply because they are moral agents. That agents are\nrequired not to kill, not to steal, and not to assault are examples of\ngeneral obligations. Agency alone makes these precepts applicable to\nindividuals. By contrast, role-related obligations are moral\nrequirements that agents have in virtue of their role, occupation, or\nposition in society. That lifeguards are required to save swimmers in\ndistress is a role-related obligation. Another example, mentioned\nearlier, is the obligation of a defense attorney to hold in confidence\nthe disclosures made by a client. These categories need not be\nexclusive. It is likely that anyone who is in a position to do so\nought to save a drowning person. And if a person has particularly\nsensitive information about another, she should probably not reveal it\nto third parties regardless of how the information was obtained. But\nlifeguards have obligations to help swimmers in distress when most\nothers do not because of their abilities and contractual commitments.\nAnd lawyers have special obligations of confidentiality to their\nclients because of implicit promises and the need to maintain\ntrust.\n\nGeneral obligations and role-related obligations can, and sometimes\ndo, conflict. If a defense attorney knows the whereabouts of a\ndeceased body, she may have a general obligation to reveal this\ninformation to family members of the deceased. But if she obtained\nthis information from her client, the role-related obligation of\nconfidentiality prohibits her from sharing it with others. Supporters\nof dilemmas may regard conflicts of this sort as just another\nconfirmation of their thesis. Opponents of dilemmas will have to hold\nthat one of the conflicting obligations takes priority. The latter\ntask could be discharged if it were shown that one these two types of\nobligations always prevails over the other. But such a claim is\nimplausible; for it seems that in some cases of conflict general\nobligations are stronger, while in other cases role-related duties\ntake priority. The case seems to be made even better for supporters of\ndilemmas, and worse for opponents, when we consider that the same\nagent can occupy multiple roles that create conflicting requirements.\nThe physician, Harvey Kelekian, in Margaret Edson\u2019s (1999/1993)\nPulitzer Prize winning play, Wit, is an oncologist, a medical\nresearcher, and a teacher of residents. The obligations generated by\nthose roles lead Dr. Kelekian to treat his patient, Vivian Bearing, in\nways that seem morally questionable (McConnell 2009). At first blush,\nanyway, it does not seem possible for Kelekian to discharge all of the\nobligations associated with these various roles.\n\nIn the context of issues raised by the possibility of moral dilemmas,\nthe role most frequently discussed is that of the political actor.\nMichael Walzer (1973) claims that the political ruler, qua political\nruler, ought to do what is best for the state; that is his principal\nrole-related obligation. But he also ought to abide by the general\nobligations incumbent on all. Sometimes the political actor\u2019s\nrole-related obligations require him to do evil\u2014that is, to\nviolate some general obligations. Among the examples given by Walzer\nare making a deal with a dishonest ward boss (necessary to get elected\nso that he can do good) and authorizing the torture of a person in\norder to uncover a plot to bomb a public building. Since each of these\nrequirements is binding, Walzer believes that the politician faces a\ngenuine moral dilemma, though, strangely, he also thinks that the\npolitician should choose the good of the community rather than abide\nby the general moral norms. (The issue here is whether supporters of\ndilemmas can meaningfully talk about action-guidance in genuinely\ndilemmatic situations. For one who answers this in the affirmative,\nsee Tessman 2015, especially Chapter 5.) Such a situation is sometimes\ncalled \u201cthe dirty hands problem.\u201d The expression,\n\u201cdirty hands,\u201d is taken from the title of a play by Sartre\n(1946). The idea is that no one can rule without becoming morally\ntainted. The role itself is fraught with moral dilemmas. This topic\nhas received much attention recently. John Parrish (2007) has provided\na detailed history of how philosophers from Plato to Adam Smith have\ndealt with the issue. And C.A.J. Coady (2008) has suggested that this\nreveals a \u201cmessy morality.\u201d\n\nFor opponents of moral dilemmas, the problem of dirty hands represents\nboth a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to show how\nconflicts between general obligations and role-related obligations,\nand those among the various role-related obligations, can be resolved\nin a principled way. The opportunity for theories that purport to have\nthe resources to eliminate dilemmas\u2014such as Kantianism,\nutilitarianism, and intuitionism\u2014is to show how the many\nmoralities under which people are governed are related.\n",
