    "main_text": "Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness || A Simple Illustration: the Prisoner's dilemma\n2.1 A Simple Illustration: the Prisoner's dilemma\n\n\nThe fact that correlation between donor and recipient is the key to\nthe evolution of altruism can be illustrated via a simple \u2018one shot\u2019\nPrisoner's dilemma game. Consider a large population of organisms who\nengage in a social interaction in pairs; the interaction affects their\nbiological fitness. Organisms are of two types: selfish (S) and\naltruistic (A). The latter engage in pro-social behaviour, thus\nbenefiting their partner but at a cost to themselves; the former do\nnot. So in a mixed (S,A) pair, the selfish organism does better\u2014he\nbenefits from his partner's altruism without incurring any\ncost. However, (A,A) pairs do better than (S,S) pairs\u2014for the former\nwork as a co-operative unit, while the latter do not. The interaction\nthus has the form of a one-shot Prisoner's dilemma, familiar from game\ntheory. Illustrative payoff values to each \u2018player\u2019, i.e., each partner\nin the interaction, measured in units of biological fitness, are shown\nin the matrix below.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer 2\n\n\n\n\nAltruist\nSelfish\n\n\nPlayer 1\nAltruist\n11,11\n0,20\n\n\nSelfish\n20,0\n5,5\n\n\nPayoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) in units of reproductive\nfitness\n\n\nThe question we are interested in is: which type will be favoured by\nselection? To make the analysis tractable, we make two simplifying\nassumptions: that reproduction is asexual, and that type is perfectly\ninherited, i.e., selfish (altruistic) organisms give rise to selfish\n(altruistic) offspring. Modulo these assumptions, the evolutionary\ndynamics can be determined very easily, simply by seeing whether\nthe S or the A type has higher fitness, in the\noverall population. The fitness of the S\ntype, W(S), is the weighted average of the payoff to\nan S when partnered with an S and the payoff to\nan S when partnered with an A, where the weights are\ndetermined by the probability of having the partner in\nquestion. Therefore,\n\nW(S) = 5 * Prob(S partner/S) + \n 20 * Prob(A partner/S)\n\n\n\n\n(The conditional probabilities in the above expression should be read\nas the probability of having a selfish (altruistic) partner, given\nthat one is selfish oneself.)\n\n\nSimilarly, the fitness of the A type is:\n\nW(A) = 0 * Prob(S partner/A) +\n 11 * Prob(A partner/A)\n\n\n\n\nFrom these expressions for the fitnesses of the two types of organism,\nwe can immediately deduce that the altruistic type will only be\nfavoured by selection if there is a statistical correlation between\npartners, i.e., if altruists have greater than random chance of being\npaired with other altruists, and similarly for selfish types. For\nsuppose there is no such correlation\u2014as would be the case if the\npairs were formed by random sampling from the population. Then, the\nprobability of having a selfish partner would be the same for\nboth S and A types, i.e., P(S\npartner/S) = P(S partner/A). Similarly,\nP(A partner/S) = P(A\npartner/A). From these probabilistic equalities, it follows\nimmediately that W(S) is greater\nthan W(A), as can be seen from the expressions for\nW(S) and W(A) above; so the\nselfish type will be favoured by natural selection, and will increase\nin frequency every generation until all the altruists are eliminated\nfrom the population. Therefore, in the absence of correlation between\npartners, selfishness must win out (cf. Skyrms 1996). This confirms the point noted in\nsection 2\u2014that altruism can only evolve if there is a statistical\ntendency for the beneficiaries of altruistic actions to be altruists\nthemselves.\n\nIf the correlation between partners is sufficiently strong, in this\nsimple model, then it is possible for the\ncondition W(A) > W(S) to be\nsatisfied, and thus for altruism to evolve. The easiest way to see\nthis is to suppose that the correlation is perfect, i.e., selfish\ntypes are always paired with other selfish types, and ditto for\naltruists, so P(S partner/S) = P(A\npartner/A) = 1. This assumption implies\nthat W(A)=11 and W(S)=5, so\naltruism evolves. With intermediate degrees of correlation, it is also\npossible for the condition W(S)\n> W(A) to be satisfied, given the particular\nchoice of payoff values in the model above.\n\nThis simple model also highlights the point made previously, that\ndonor-recipient correlation, rather than genetic relatedness, is the\nkey to the evolution of altruism. What is needed for altruism to\nevolve, in the model above, is for the probability of having a partner\nof the same type as oneself to be sufficiently larger than the\nprobability of having a partner of opposite type; this ensures that\nthe recipients of altruism have a greater than random chance of being\nfellow altruists, i.e., donor-recipient correlation. Whether this\ncorrelation arises because partners tend to be relatives, or because\naltruists are able to seek out other altruists and choose them as\npartners, or for some other reason, makes no difference to the\nevolutionary dynamics, at least in this simple example. \n",
