    "main_text": "Grammar || The Subject Matter of Grammar\n3.1 The Subject Matter of Grammar\n\nIn his commentary on Priscian Minor, Brito endeavors to show\nthat grammar meets the criteria a medieval discipline must meet in\norder to be considered a theoretical science. In doing so, he puts\nforth his own account of grammar as an independent theoretical science\nin terms of both subject matter and principles (for Brito\u2019s\ntheoretical grammar, see Pinborg 1967; Rosier-Catach 1983, 1999, 2010;\nEbbesen 1998a.). Regarding grammar\u2019s subject matter,\nBrito\u2019s position is that, from the point of view of predication,\nsignificant speech (sermo significativus) is the general\nsubject matter. In fact, significant speech is: \n\n the common predicate of what is first known in grammar; \n that the existence of which is presupposed by grammar; and \n that the features of which are demonstrated in grammar\n(QPm; QPm-1980: 103\u2013104). \n\n\nHowever, from the point of view of attribution, the expression\n(oratio) can also be considered the subject matter of\ngrammar, as everything that grammar considers is in one way or another\nrelated to it (QPm; QPm-1980: 104). More\nspecifically, from the point of view of predication, the expression is\ndiscussed in the so-called Priscian Minor (books\nXVII\u2013XVIII of Priscian\u2019s Institutiones), which is\nexclusively concerned with the principles of grammatical expressions\nand with the demonstration of their features (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 107).\n",
