Only some of these distinctions will\nbe mentioned here. It is worth noting that both supporters and\nopponents of dilemmas tend to draw some, if not all, of these\ndistinctions. And in most cases the motivation for doing so is clear.\nSupporters of dilemmas may draw a distinction between dilemmas of type\n\\(V\\) and \\(W\\). The upshot is typically a message to opponents of\ndilemmas: \u201cYou think that all moral conflicts are resolvable.\nAnd that is understandable, because conflicts of type \\(V\\) are\nresolvable. But conflicts of type \\(W\\) are not resolvable. Thus,\ncontrary to your view, there are some genuine moral dilemmas.\u201d\nBy the same token, opponents of dilemmas may draw a distinction\nbetween dilemmas of type \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). And their message to\nsupporters of dilemmas is this: \u201cYou think that there are\ngenuine moral dilemmas, and given certain facts, it is understandable\nwhy this appears to be the case. But if you draw a distinction between\nconflicts of types \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), you can see that appearances can\nbe explained by the existence of type \\(X\\) alone, and type \\(X\\)\nconflicts are not genuine dilemmas.\u201d With this in mind, let us\nnote a few of the distinctions.\n\nOne distinction is between epistemic conflicts and\nontological conflicts. (For different terminology, see\nBlackburn 1996, 127\u2013128.) The former involve conflicts between\ntwo (or more) moral requirements and the agent does not know which of\nthe conflicting requirements takes precedence in her situation.\nEveryone concedes that there can be situations where one requirement\ndoes take priority over the other with which it conflicts, though at\nthe time action is called for it is difficult for the agent to tell\nwhich requirement prevails. The latter are conflicts between two (or\nmore) moral requirements, and neither is overridden. This is not\nsimply because the agent does not know which requirement is\nstronger; neither is. Genuine moral dilemmas, if there are any, are\nontological. Both opponents and supporters of dilemmas acknowledge\nthat there are epistemic conflicts.\n\nThere can be genuine moral dilemmas only if neither of the conflicting\nrequirements is overridden. Ross (1930, Chapter 2) held that all moral\nprecepts can be overridden in particular circumstances. This provides\nan inviting framework for opponents of dilemmas to adopt. But if some\nmoral requirements cannot be overridden\u2014if they hold\nabsolutely\u2014then it will be easier for supporters of dilemmas to\nmake their case. Lisa Tessman has distinguished between negotiable and\nnon-negotiable moral requirements (Tessman 2015, especially Chapters 1\nand 3). The former, if not satisfied, can be adequately compensated or\ncounterbalanced by some other good. Non-negotiable moral requirements,\nhowever, if violated produce a cost that no one should have to bear;\nsuch a violation cannot be counterbalanced by any benefits. If\nnon-negotiable moral requirements can conflict\u2014and Tessman\nargues that they can\u2014then those situations will be genuine\ndilemmas and agents facing them will inevitably fail morally. It might\nseem that if there is more than one moral precept that holds\nabsolutely, then moral dilemmas must be possible. Alan Donagan,\nhowever, argues against this. He maintains that moral rules hold\nabsolutely, and apparent exceptions are accounted for because tacit\nconditions are built in to each moral rule (Donagan 1977, Chapters 3\nand 6, especially 92\u201393). So even if some moral requirements\ncannot be overridden, the existence of dilemmas may still be an open\nquestion.\n\nAnother distinction is between self-imposed moral dilemmas\nand dilemmas imposed on an agent by the world, as it were.\nConflicts of the former sort arise because of the agent\u2019s own\nwrongdoing (Aquinas; Donagan 1977, 1984; and McConnell 1978). If an\nagent made two promises that he knew conflicted, then through his own\nactions he created a situation in which it is not possible for him to\ndischarge both of his requirements. Dilemmas imposed on the agent by\nthe world (or other agents), by contrast, do not arise because of the\nagent\u2019s wrongdoing. The case of Sartre\u2019s student is an\nexample, as is the case from Sophie\u2019s Choice. For\nsupporters of dilemmas, this distinction is not all that important.\nBut among opponents of dilemmas, there is a disagreement about whether\nthe distinction is important. Some of these opponents hold that\nself-imposed dilemmas are possible, but that their existence does not\npoint to any deep flaws in moral theory (Donagan 1977, Chapter 5).\nMoral theory tells agents how they ought to behave; but if agents\nviolate moral norms, of course things can go askew. Other opponents\ndeny that even self-imposed dilemmas are possible. They argue that an\nadequate moral theory should tell agents what they ought to do in\ntheir current circumstances, regardless of how those circumstances\narose. As Hill puts it, \u201c[M]orality acknowledges that human\nbeings are imperfect and often guilty, but it calls upon each at every\nnew moment of moral deliberation to decide conscientiously and to act\nrightly from that point on\u201d (Hill 1996, 176). Given the\nprevalence of wrongdoing, if a moral theory did not issue uniquely\naction-guiding \u201ccontrary-to-duty imperatives,\u201d its\npractical import would be limited. \n\nYet another distinction is between obligation dilemmas and\nprohibition dilemmas. The former are situations in which more\nthan one feasible action is obligatory. The latter involve cases in\nwhich all feasible actions are forbidden. Some (especially, Valentyne\n1987 and 1989) argue that plausible principles of deontic logic may\nwell render obligation dilemmas impossible; but they do not preclude\nthe possibility of prohibition dilemmas. The case of Sartre\u2019s\nstudent, if genuinely dilemmatic, is an obligation dilemma;\nSophie\u2019s case is a prohibition dilemma. There is another reason\nthat friends of dilemmas emphasize this distinction. Some think that\nthe \u201cdisjunctive solution\u201d used by opponents of\ndilemmas\u2014when equally strong precepts conflict, the agent is\nrequired to act on one or the other\u2014is more plausible when\napplied to obligation dilemmas than when applied to prohibition\ndilemmas.\n\nAs moral dilemmas are typically described, they involve a single\nagent. The agent ought, all things considered, to do \\(A\\),\nought, all things considered, to do \\(B\\), and she cannot do both\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\). But we can distinguish multi-person dilemmas\nfrom single agent ones. The two-person case is representative of\nmulti-person dilemmas. The situation is such that one agent, P1, ought\nto do \\(A\\), a second agent, P2, ought to do \\(B\\), and though each\nagent can do what he ought to do, it is not possible both for P1 to do\n\\(A\\) and P2 to do \\(B\\). (See Marcus 1980, 122 and McConnell 1988.)\nMulti-person dilemmas have been called \u201cinterpersonal moral\nconflicts.\u201d Such conflicts are most theoretically worrisome if\nthe same moral system (or theory) generates the conflicting\nobligations for P1 and P2. A theory that precludes single-agent moral\ndilemmas remains uniquely action-guiding for each agent. But if that\nsame theory does not preclude the possibility of interpersonal moral\nconflicts, not all agents will be able to succeed in discharging their\nobligations, no matter how well-motivated or how hard they try. For\nsupporters of moral dilemmas, this distinction is not all that\nimportant. They no doubt welcome (theoretically) more types of\ndilemmas, since that may make their case more persuasive. But if they\nestablish the reality of single-agent dilemmas, in one sense their\nwork is done. For opponents of dilemmas, however, the distinction may\nbe important. This is because at least some opponents believe that the\nconceptual argument against dilemmas applies principally to\nsingle-agent cases. It does so because the ought-to-do operator of\ndeontic logic and the accompanying principles are properly understood\nto apply to entities who can make decisions. To be clear, this\nposition does not preclude that collectives (such as businesses or\nnations) can have obligations. But a necessary condition for this\nbeing the case is that there is (or should be) a central deliberative\nstandpoint from which decisions are made. This condition is not\nsatisfied when two otherwise unrelated agents happen to have\nobligations both of which cannot be discharged. Put simply, while an\nindividual act involving one agent can be the object of choice, a\ncompound act involving multiple agents is difficult so to conceive.\n(See Smith 1986 and Thomason 1981.) Alexander Dietz (2022) has\nrecently shown, however, that matters can be even more complicated. He\ndescribes a case where a small group of people have an obligation to\nsave two strangers, but one of the members of the group has an\nobligation to save her own child at the same time. The small group and\nthe individual can both make choices, and the group\u2019s obligation\nconflicts with that of the individual member (assuming that the group\ncan succeed only if all members act in concert). This is an odd\nmulti-agent dilemma, \u201cone in which one of the agents is part of\nthe other\u201d (Dietz 2022, p. 66). Erin Taylor (2011) has argued\nthat neither universalizability nor the principle that\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019 ensure that there will\nbe no interpersonal moral conflicts (what she calls\n\u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d). These conflicts would raise\nno difficulties if morality required trying rather than acting, but\nsuch a view is not plausible. Still, moral theories should minimize\ncases of interpersonal conflict (Taylor 2011, pp. 189\u2013190).To\nthe extent that the possibility of interpersonal moral conflicts\nraises an intramural dispute among opponents of dilemmas, that dispute\nconcerns how to understand the principles of deontic logic and what\ncan reasonably be demanded of moral theories.\n",
