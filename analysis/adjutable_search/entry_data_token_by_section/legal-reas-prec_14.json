    "main_text": "The Justification for Analogical Reasoning\n6. Summary\n\n\nPrecedent and analogy are two central and complementary forms of legal\nargument. What makes them characteristic of legal reasoning\nis the circumstances of decision-making in law. The greatest contrast\nis with individual reasoning, where neither precedent nor analogy have\nthe same significance. An individual may give weight to what she has\ndone in the past, e.g. because she believes the decision was made\nunder optimum conditions, or she should not or does not want to\ndisappoint someone's expectations, or there are special reasons\nto treat the two situations identically.  Similarly, the comparison of\nthe problem at hand with another situation may help clarify\none's thinking, but one's judgement on the other case is\nonly relevant to the extent that it is correct.\n\n\nIn an institutionalised system with many decision-makers and a\nheterogeneous group of legal materials there is a tension between\ndecision-making being relatively predictable for those to whom it will\napply and the law being morally improved. In such a context precedent\nand analogy help to shore up the predictability of decisions whilst\nleaving room for courts to improve the law. They do this in two\ndifferent ways. Precedents are distinguishable (and subject to\noverruling), while analogies provide non-conclusive reasons for\nreaching a particular outcome. The success of these compromises\ndepends upon there being a fair measure of background agreement\nbetween decision-makers over the important values served by the\nlaw\u2014both measures would be too weak in the face of widespread\nand deep value disagreement. A range of mechanisms exist in law that\nhelp maintain such a relative consensus: legal education, the working\nenvironment, and the selection of candidates for the bench all tend to\nproduce more convergence than is found in the general community. In\naddition, there is an internal feedback element\u2014in deciding\ncases, courts are aware that their decisions can be distinguished (as\nwell as overruled), and that it is only their ruling that are binding\non later courts. This gives them good reasons to press justifications\nthat are based on values widely endorsed by their brethren.\n",
