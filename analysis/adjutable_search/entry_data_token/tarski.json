He is widely considered as one of the\ngreatest logicians of the twentieth century (often regarded as second\nonly to G\u00f6del), and thus as one of the greatest logicians of all\ntime. Among philosophers he is especially known for his mathematical\ncharacterizations of the concepts of truth and logical consequence for\nsentences of classical formalized languages, and to a lesser extent\nfor his mathematical characterization of the concept of a logical\nconstant for expressions of those same languages. Among logicians and\nmathematicians he is in addition famous for his work on set theory,\nmodel theory and algebra, which includes results and developments such\nas the Banach-Tarski paradox, the theorem on the indefinability of\ntruth (see section 2 below), the completeness and decidability of\nelementary algebra and geometry, and the notions of cardinal, ordinal,\nrelation and cylindric algebras. After a biographical sketch, this\nentry offers a condensed exposition of the parts of Tarski\u2019s\nwork that are most relevant to philosophy, his theories of truth,\nlogical consequence and logical constants. In this exposition we have\nattempted to remain as close as possible to Tarski\u2019s original\npresentations, reducing to a minimum the number of claims that might\nbe controversial philosophically or exegetically.

Biographical sketch\n\nTarski was born on January 14, 1901 in Warsaw, then a part of the\nRussian Empire. His family name at birth was Tajtelbaum, changed to\nTarski in 1923. He studied mathematics and philosophy at the\nUniversity of Warsaw from 1918 to 1924, taking courses with\nKotarbi\u0144ski, Le\u015bniewski, \u0141ukasiewicz, Mazurkiewicz and\nSierpi\u0144ski among others. (See Lvov-Warsaw School.) He got a\ndoctoral degree, under Le\u015bniewski\u2019s supervision, in 1924.\nFrom then until 1939 he taught mathematics at a high school and held\nminor teaching positions at the University of Warsaw. In this period\nhe published prolifically on logic and set theory, building a strong\ninternational reputation for himself. Yet he failed in his attempt to\nobtain a professorship at the University of Lvov (now Lviv) in 1939.\nIn 1929 he married Maria Witkowska, with whom he soon had two\nchildren, Ina and Jan.\n\nIn August 1939 Tarski traveled to the United States to attend a\ncongress of the Unity of Science movement (see Vienna Circle). World\nWar II broke out soon after that, leaving Tarski no option but to stay\nin the States. He spent the war years separated from his family,\nforced to remain in Poland. In this period he held several temporary\nuniversity positions, at Harvard University, the City College of New\nYork, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, where he was eventually given\ntenure in 1945 and a professorship in mathematics in 1948. Maria, Ina\nand Jan were able to join him in Berkeley in 1946.\n\nIn Berkeley Tarski built a prominent school of research in logic and\nthe foundations of mathematics and science, centered around the\nprestigious graduate program in logic and methodology of science,\nwhich he was also instrumental in creating. He received many academic\nhonors, such as the membership in the National Academy of Sciences of\nthe USA and the election as Corresponding Fellow of the British\nAcademy. Tarski remained affiliated to Berkeley until his death, on\nOctober 27, 1983.\n2. Truth\n\nIn a logic seminar he gave at the University of Warsaw between 1927\nand 1929, Tarski proved several results that made reference to notions\nthat later would be called \u201csemantical\u201d, in particular\nresults about the notions of definability and of truth in a structure\n(see Vaught 1974 and 1986). Vaught informs us that Tarski found\ncertain difficulties when trying to give a mathematically satisfactory\nform to the results presented in the seminar, and that this led him to\nlook for a precise theory of the semantical notions (cf. Vaught 1974,\npp. 160ff. and 1986, pp. 870ff.). Such a theory did not exist at the\ntime. In particular, there were no definitions of these notions in\nterms of concepts accepted in the foundational systems designed for\nthe reconstruction of classical mathematics (for example, Russell and\nWhitehead\u2019s theory of types or Zermelo\u2019s set theory).\nBecause of this, the existing results in which these notions appeared\ncould not be reconstructed in the accepted foundational systems. And\nthere was no rigorous axiomatic theory of the semantical notions in\nwhich these were taken as primitive, either.\n\nIn spite of this, the results about semantical notions were important\nand even moderately abundant by 1930. Among these Tarski himself would\nmention G\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem and several versions\nof the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp.\n240\u20131, sp. p. 240 n.1, and p. 241 n. 2). All these results use\nthe notion of truth in a structure, or functionally equivalent\nnotions. And Tarski says that\n\nit is evident that all these results only receive a clear content and\ncan only then be exactly proved, if a concrete and precisely\nformulated definition of [true] sentence is accepted as a basis for\nthe investigation (Tarski 1983b, p. 241).\n\n\nTarski\u2019s aim in a series of works on semantical notions was\nprecisely to propose mathematically acceptable definitions of those\nnotions, and in particular acceptable in some one of the chief\nfoundational systems (the system chosen by Tarski will change with\ntime; see below). With appropriate definitions of those notions, the\ntheorems about them would be susceptible of being reformulated making\nuse of the defined notions, and the uneasiness described by Tarski in\nthe text just quoted would be alleviated. The alternative of taking\nthe semantical notions as primitive is also considered by Tarski in\nseveral places, but he clearly prefers to avoid it if possible. The\nreason is that in the axiomatic alternative there is no negligible\nrisk that there remain ways of generating the semantical antinomies\nfor the semantical primitives of the system (cf. Tarski 1983b, p.\n255). With the definitional procedure, however, the consistency of the\ndefinition would depend exclusively on the consistency of the theory\nin which it is formulated, and this will be a theory we have reasons\nto think is consistent.\n\nThe first work containing a mathematical definition of one of the\nsemantical notions is Tarski (1931) (English version, Tarski 1983d),\nwhere Tarski examines a language L in which it is possible to\nformalize the arithmetic of the real numbers, and gives a recursive\ndefinition of the notion \u201cset of real numbers definable in\nL\u201d (cf. Def. 9 in Tarski 1983d, p. 128). The definition\ndepends on others that are a bit cumbersome; today we would define a\nsimilar notion in a simpler way with the help of the definition of\ntruth that Tarski himself would publish two years later. But the\nessence of the Tarskian definition of truth is already here. In the\n1931 paper we find also, as was to be expected, the Tarskian concern\nwith matters of precision and foundational rigor, and a revealing\nstatement about the attitude of mathematicians toward the notion of\ndefinability, that could be extended to other semantical notions:\n\nThe distrust of mathematicians towards the notion in question is\nreinforced by the current opinion that this notion is outside the\nproper limits of mathematics altogether. The problems of making its\nmeaning more precise, of removing the confusions and misunderstandings\nconnected with it, and of establishing its fundamental properties\nbelong to another branch of science\u2014metamathematics (Tarski\n1983d, p. 110).\n\n\nIn his classic monograph on the concept of truth \u201cThe Concept of\nTruth in Formalized Languages\u201d (Polish original version, Tarski\n1933; German translation with an added postscript, Tarski 1935;\nEnglish version of the German text, Tarski 1983b), Tarski will present\na method for constructing definitions of truth for classical\nquantificational formal languages. When one succeeds in applying this\nmethod to a particular formal language, the end result will be the\nconstruction of a predicate in a metalanguage for that language whose\nessential properties will be that it will be constructed out of\nnon-suspicious mathematical vocabulary and that it will be intuitively\nsatisfied precisely by the intuitively true sentences of the object\nlanguage. At the same time, Tarski shows how, in terms of the defined\nnotion of truth, one can give intuitively adequate definitions of the\nsemantical notions of definability and denotation, and he indicates\nhow it is possible to define the notion of truth in a structure in a\nway analogous to the one used to define\n truth.[1]\n That allows him to conclude that the acceptability and rigor of the\n\u201crecent methodological studies\u201d (of L\u00f6wenheim,\nSkolem, G\u00f6del and Tarski himself, among others), have been\nvindicated (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 266).\n\nLanguages, both object languages and metalanguages, are in the\nmonograph not just interpreted grammars; a language also includes a\ndeductive system. A Tarskian metalanguage always includes its object\nlanguage as a part, both its grammar (perhaps under some translation)\nand its deductive system. And besides, it will always contain a few\nmore things if these things are not already in the object language.\nSpecifically, it will always contain a sub-language and sub-theory\nthat can be used to say a great deal of things about the syntax of the\nobject language; and it will always contain all the mathematics (both\nconcepts and methods of proof) that \u201cmay be taken from any\nsufficiently developed system of mathematical logic\u201d (Tarski\n1983b, p. 211).\n\nTarski doesn\u2019t give a general formulation of his method. Such a\ngeneral formulation would not be too illuminating. Instead he\nhelpfully chooses to illustrate his method as it would work for a few\nlanguages. The most basic example he uses, to which about half of his\nmonograph is devoted, is what he calls \u201cthe language of the\ncalculus of classes\u201d (LCC). Here is a quick description in more\ncurrent notation (Tarski uses \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Polish\nnotation):\n\nprimitive signs of LCC: \u2200, \u2228, \u00ac, (, ), I (a binary\npredicate), x, \u2032 (a subindex\naccent to generate variables by suffixing to \u201cx\u201d;\nlet\u2019s use the notation xn for the\nx followed by n accents).\ngrammar of LCC: Atomic formulae are of the form\nIxkxl.\nComplex formulae are obtained by negation, disjunction and universal\nquantification.\ninterpretation of LCC: The range of the variables is the class of\nall subclasses of individuals (of the universe). I stands for the\nrelation of inclusion among these subclasses. The other signs mean\nwhat you would expect.\n\n\nBesides all this, Tarski gives a deductive system for LCC, as required\nof every language.\n\nTarski\u2019s most basic idea about how to construct a truth\npredicate, a predicate which will be intuitively satisfied exactly by\nthe intuitively true sentences of LCC, is that such a predicate should\nverify what he calls \u201cconvention T\u201d. This\nconvention imposes a condition on defined truth predicates ((a) in the\nexample immediately below) that Tarski often talks about as grasping\nthe intuitions behind the \u201cclassical Aristotelian conception of\ntruth\u201d (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 155; 1944, pp. 342\u20133).\nConvention T is here spelled out for the case of\nLCC:\n\n\nConvention T. A formally correct definition of the\nsymbol \u201cTr\u201d, formulated in the metalanguage, will be\ncalled an adequate definition of truth if the deductive\nsystem of the metatheory proves the following:\n\nall sentences which are obtained from the expression\n\u201cTr(x) if and only if p\u201d by substituting\nfor the symbol \u201cx\u201d a structural-descriptive name\nof any sentence of the language in question and for the symbol\n\u201cp\u201d the expression which forms the translation of\nthis sentence into the metalanguage;\nthe sentence \u201cfor any x, if Tr(x) then\nx is a sentence of LCC\u201d (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp.\n187\u20138).\n\n\n\nThat a definition is \u201cformally correct\u201d means, roughly,\nthat it will be constructed out of non-suspicious vocabulary following\nnon-controversial rules for defining new expressions. But why should\none think that a predicate verifying convention T\nshould be, besides, coextensional with the intuitive predicate of\ntruth for LCC? The reason can be given by an intuitive argument\nrelating both predicates, such as the following (cf. Tarski 1944, pp.\n353\u20134):\n\n\n(\u21d2) Suppose that \u201cp\u201d is a sentence of LCC\nsuch that Tr(\u201cp\u201d). By assumption,\n\u201cTr(\u201dp\u201c) if and only if p\u201d\nis provable in the metalanguage. So Tr(\u201cp\u201d) if\nand only if p (the metalanguage must only prove truths). So\np. So \u201cp\u201d is true.\n\n(\u21d0) Suppose that \u201cp\u201d is true. Then\np. And then, as before, Tr(\u201cp\u201d).\n\n\nTarski defines truth in terms of the notion of the satisfaction of a\nformula of LCC by an infinite sequence of assignments (of appropriate\nobjects: subclasses of the universe of individuals in the case of\nLCC). He gives first a recursive definition and immediately indicates\nhow to transform it into a normal or explicit definition. The\nrecursive definition is this: an infinite sequence of classes\nf satisfies formula F if and only if f and\nF are such that\n\nthere are natural numbers k and l such that\nF =\nIxkxl and\nf(k)\u2286f(l); or \nthere is a formula G such that F=\u00acG\nand f does not satisfy G; or \nthere are formulae G and H such that\nF=(G\u2228H) and f satisfies\nG or f satisfies H; or finally,\nthere is a natural number k and a formula G such\nthat F=\u2200xkG and\nevery infinite sequence of subclasses that differs from f at\nmost in the kth place satisfies G (cf. Tarski 1983b,\np. 193).\n\n\nThe normal definition is this:\n\n\nAn infinite sequence of subclasses f satisfies a formula\nF if and only if f and F stand in every\nrelation R among sequences and formulae such that, for any\ng and G, g and G stand in\nR if and only if g is an infinite sequence of\nsubclasses, F is a formula and either\n\nthere are natural numbers k and l such that\nG =\nIxkxl and\ng(k)\u2286g(l); or\nthere is a formula H such that G is\n\u00acH and g and H don\u2019t stand in\nR; or\nthere are formulae H and I such that G\nis (H\u2228I) and g and H stand in\nR or g and I stand in R; or\nthere is a natural number k and a formula H such\nthat G is \u2200xkH\nand, for every infinite sequence of subclasses h that differs\nfrom g at most in the kth place, h and\nH stand in R (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 193, n. 1).\n\n\n\nTarski then defines the truth predicate as follows:\n\nFor all x, Tr(x) if and only if x is a\nsentence of LCC and every infinite sequence of subclasses satisfies\nx (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 195).\n\n\nGiven the way the definition has been constructed, it is intuitively\nclear that the metalanguage will prove all biconditionals of the\nconvention T for LCC. Tarski does not prove this\ncumbersome fact in a metametalanguage, and he helpfully contents\nhimself with showing how a few of the biconditionals would be\nestablished in the metalanguage.\n\nThe usual reasonings leading to the semantical antinomies cannot be\nreproduced for the Tarskian defined semantical concepts. In\nparticular, the antinomy of the liar cannot be reproduced using the\ndefined predicate Tr. Consider the version of the antinomy offered by\nTarski (due to \u0141ukasiewicz). Abbreviate the expression \u201cthe\nfirst underlined sentence of this entry\u201d with the letter\n\u201cc\u201d. Now consider the sentence:\n\nc is not a true sentence.\n\n\nGiven what \u201cc\u201d abbreviates, we get\n\n(a) \u201cc is not a true sentence\u201d = c\n\n\nAnd the following is intuitively true:\n\n(b) \u201cc is not a true sentence\u201d is a true sentence\nif and only if c is not a true sentence.\n\n\nFrom (a) and (b) follows the contradiction\n\nc is a true sentence if and only if c is not a true\nsentence.\n\n\nThe reason why this cannot be reproduced for Tr is that this predicate\nis always a predicate of a language (the metalanguage) different from\nthe language of the sentences to which it applies (the object\nlanguage). It is not possible to form a sentence of the language for\nwhich one defines Tr that says of itself that it is (not) Tr, since Tr\nis not a predicate of that language. On the other hand, it is\ncertainly possible in some cases to form a sentence S of the\nmetalanguage that says of itself that it is not Tr, but since\nS is a sentence of the metalanguage it is simply true and\n(presumably) not paradoxical, since there is no reason why a\nbiconditional like (b) should hold for it; biconditionals of this kind\nhold only for sentences of the language for which Tr has been defined,\nnot for sentences of the metalanguage.\n\nLCC has the property of being what Tarski calls a \u201clanguage of\nfinite order\u201d. The idea of order is familiar. Variables for\nindividuals (non-existent in LCC) are of order 1. Variables for\nclasses of individuals (all the variables of LCC) are of order 2.\nVariables for classes of classes of individuals are of order 3, and so\non. The order of a language of this series is the greatest positive\ninteger n with variables of order n. (Thus, although\nLCC looks grammatically just like a first-order language, semantically\nit can be seen as a fragment of what under present conventions would\nbe called a second-order language.)\n\nBut there are also languages of infinite order. In these the order of\nthe available variables is not bounded above. Tarski gives an example,\nwhich he calls \u201cthe language of the general theory of\nclasses\u201d (LGTC). Here again is a quick description in more\ncurrent notation:\n\nprimitive signs of LGTC: \u2200, \u2228, \u00ac, (, ), X,\n\u2032, \u2032 (The last two are a subindex\naccent and a superindex accent to generate variables by suffixing to\n\u201cX\u201d; let\u2019s use the notation\nXnm for the\nX followed by n subindex accents and m\nsuperindex accents. The superindex must be positive.)\ngrammar of LGTC: Atomic formulae are of the form\nXnm+1Xpm.\nComplex formulae are obtained by negation, disjunction and universal\nquantification with respect to the variables of all orders.\ninterpretation of LGTC: A variable of the form\nXn1 takes as values\nindividuals, a variable of the form\nXn2 takes as values classes of\nindividuals, a variable of the form\nXn3 takes as values classes of\nclasses of individuals, etc.\nXnm+1Xpm\n\u201cmeans\u201d that the object assigned to\nXnm+1\n\u201ccontains\u201d the object assigned to\nXpm. The other signs\nmean what you would expect.\n\n\nBesides all this, Tarski gives a deductive system for LGTC, as\nrequired of every language. Suffice it to say that it is a version of\na typical simple theory of finite types, with axioms and rules for the\nconnectives and quantifiers, axioms of comprehension and\nextensionality for all orders, and an axiom of infinity. Tarski\nobserves that LGTC suffices, with the help of some tricks, to develop\nall the mathematics that can be developed in the simple theory of\nfinite types, even though it has formally fewer types of\nvariables.\n\nIn the 1933 original Polish version of his monograph Tarski says that\nhis method for constructing truth predicates cannot be applied to the\nconstruction of a truth predicate for LGTC. The problem is that in\n1933 Tarski adopts as the mathematical apparatus of his metalanguages\nthe simple theory of finite types, or equivalently, LGTC. In this\nlanguage, supplemented (and even unsupplemented) by a theory of syntax\nfor LCC, Tarski has everything he needs to give his definition of\nsatisfaction for LCC. In particular, the relation of satisfaction for\nLCC is a relation that can be found in the hierarchy of finite types.\n(Full set theory is not needed.) And the form in which Tarski defines\nit quantifies only over sequences of classes and over relations among\nsequences of classes and formulae (as we may check above), and these\nare objects quantifiable over in finite type theory.\n\nBut the construction of a Tarskian truth predicate for LGTC could not\nbe carried out in finite type theory. The relation of satisfaction for\nLGTC is intuitively a relation among formulae and sequences of:\nsequences of individuals, sequences of classes of individuals,\nsequences of classes of classes of individuals, etc. And this relation\nis not a relation in the hierarchy of finite types. Much less can one\nquantify in finite type theory over the objects necessary to apply the\nTarskian method. One cannot quantify over sequences of: sequences of\nindividuals, sequences of classes of individuals, sequences of classes\nof classes of individuals, etc.; and one cannot quantify over\nrelations among formulae and sequences of: sequences of individuals,\nsequences of classes of individuals, sequences of classes of classes\nof individuals, etc.\n\nIt is this situation that leads Tarski to wonder\n\nwhether our failure is accidental and in some way connected with\ndefects in the methods actually used, or whether obstacles of a\nfundamental kind play a part which are connected with the nature of\nthe concepts we wish to define, or of those with the help of which we\nhave tried to construct the required definitions (Tarski 1983b, p.\n246).\n\n\nThere is a problem even in formulating the question precisely, for, as\nTarski notes,\n\nif the second supposition [of the preceding quotation] is the correct\none all efforts intended to improve the methods of construction would\nclearly be fruitless (Tarski 1983b, p. 246).\n\n\nBut\n\nit will be remembered that in the convention T of\n\u00a73 the conditions which decide the material correctness of any\ndefinition of true sentence are exactly stipulated. The construction\nof a definition which satisfies these conditions forms in fact the\nprincipal object of our investigation. From this standpoint the\nproblem we are now considering takes on a precise form: it is a\nquestion of whether on the basis of the metatheory of the language\nwe are considering the construction of a correct definition of truth\nin the sense of convention T is in principle\npossible. As we shall see, the problem in this form can be\ndefinitively solved, but in a negative sense (Tarski 1983b,\np. 246).\n\n\nThe negative answer is provided by a version of Tarski\u2019s theorem\nof the indefinability of truth. The weakest Tarskian metalanguage for\nLGTC will consist in expanding LGTC by means of concepts and a theory\nof the syntax of LGTC. But the mathematical part of the metalanguage\nwill be the same, for that\u2019s the \u201csufficiently developed\nsystem of mathematical logic\u201d of which Tarski spoke. Further,\nthe metalanguage will obviously contain its object language as part,\nboth its grammar (under no translation) and its deductive system,\nbecause LGTC will appear both in the object language and in the\nmetalanguage (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 247).\n\nIn a word, the metalanguage, which we may call \u201cLGTC+\u201d, is\nLGTC plus a theory of the syntax of LGTC. The question that Tarski\nposes is, then, whether there is a predicate constructible in LGTC+\nwhich verifies the convention T for sentences of\nLGTC. Tarski solves it negatively by proving the following\ntheorem:\n\n\nTheorem I. (a) In whatever way the symbol\n\u201cTr\u201d, denoting a class of expressions, is defined in\nLGTC+, it will be possible to derive from it the negation of one of\nthe sentences which were described in the condition (a) of the\nconvention T;\n\n(b) assuming that the class of all provable sentences of the\nmetatheory is consistent, it is impossible to construct an adequate\ndefinition of truth in the sense of convention T on\nthe basis of LGTC+ (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 247).\n\n\nPart (b) of Theorem I is a trivial consequence of part (a), since it\nis the mark of a consistent system that it doesn\u2019t contain a\nsentence and its negation. The proof of part (a) is an application of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s technique of diagonalization. The following are the\nbasic steps described using the anachronistic recourse to a more\nfamiliar case and to a modern, streamlined notation.\n\nView LGTC as if it were a standard language L for first-order\narithmetic. Suppose we extend it with a theory for talking about the\nsyntax of L (this would not be a Tarskian metalanguage, since it would\nnot include a \u201csufficiently developed system of mathematical\nlogic\u201d, but all this is just for purposes of illustration). Call\nthe extension L+. Then L+ can be \u201cinterpreted\u201d in L using\nG\u00f6delian techniques, by which Tarski means, roughly, that one can\ntranslate L+ into L arithmetizing it in such a way that the\ntranslations of theorems of L+ will be theorems of L. Now suppose that\n\u03c6(n) is the nth expression of L (and that this\nfunction is definable in L+), that d(x) is a\ndiagonal function for expressions of L (which is definable in L+; here\nI have in mind one involving substitution of numerals for free\nvariables), and let n be the numeral of n.\nThen for every predicate E(x) of expressions of L\ndefined in L+ one can prove in L+ a general sentence of the form\n\u2200n[\u00acE(d(\u03c6(n)))\u2194\u03c8(n)],\nwhere \u03c8(n) is a formula with one free variable entirely\nconstructed in L (through the arithmetization of the L+ predicate\n\u201c\u00acE(d(\u03c6(n)))\u201d). Then\none can also prove the sentence\n\u00acE(d(\u03c6(k)))\u2194\u03c8(k),\nwhere k is the G\u00f6del number of \u03c8(n).\nd(\u03c6(k)) is the sentence\n\u03c8(k), so \u03c8(k) is a\n\u201cfixed point\u201d of the predicate \u00acE(x): it\n\u201csays of itself\u201d that it has the property expressed by\n\u00acE(x). The sentence\n\u00acE(d(\u03c6(k)))\u2194\u03c8(k)\nis already equivalent to the sentence\n\u00ac[E(d(\u03c6(k)))\u2194\u03c8(k)],\nand part (a) of Theorem I is proved.\n\nIn the postscript to the 1935 German translation of the monograph on\ntruth, Tarski abandons the 1933 requirement that the apparatus of the\nmetatheory be formalizable in finite type theory, and accepts the use\nof a more powerful theory of transfinite types, where the transfinite\nobjects are classes of the objects of lower types, or the use of set\ntheory. Tarski notes that the relation of satisfaction and a truth\npredicate for LGTC (and LGTC+) are definable in these more powerful\nmetatheories (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp. 271\u20132). But he also says\nthat the proof of the indefinability theorem can be adapted to show\nthat, in general, one cannot define a truth predicate \u201cif the\norder of the metalanguage is at most equal to that of the language\nitself\u201d (Tarski 1983b, p. 273).\n3. Logical consequence\n\nTarski presents his theory of logical consequence in Tarski (1936a)\n(German version, Tarski 1936b; English translation of the Polish,\nTarski 2002; English translation of the German, Tarski 1983c). This\nclassic paper begins with some general remarks on the possibility of a\nprecise definition of the concept of consequence. The essence of these\nremarks is that since the common concept is vague, it seems certainly\ndifficult, and perhaps impossible, to reconcile all features of its\nuse in the definition of a corresponding precise concept.\nNevertheless, Tarski says, logicians had thought until recently that\nthey had managed to define a precise concept that coincided exactly in\nextension with the intuitive concept of consequence. Tarski mentions\nthe extraordinary development of mathematical logic in recent decades,\nwhich had shown \u201chow to present mathematical disciplines in the\nshape of formalized deductive theories\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 409).\nIn these theories, consequences are extracted from axioms and theorems\nby rules of inference, \u201csuch as the rules of substitution and\ndetachment\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 410), of a purely syntactical (or\n\u201cstructural\u201d, in Tarski\u2019s word) nature.\n\u201cWhenever a sentence follows from others, it can be obtained\nfrom them\u2014so it was thought\u2014by means of the\ntransformations prescribed by the rules\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 410).\nAccording to Tarski, this belief of the logicians was justified by\n\u201cthe fact that they had actually succeeded in reproducing in the\nshape of formalized proofs all the exact reasonings which had ever\nbeen carried out in mathematics\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 410).\n\nBut Tarski goes on to claim that that belief of the logicians was\nwrong. There are some non-vague cases in which a certain sentence of a\nhigher-order language follows in the intuitive sense from a set of\nother sentences of that language but cannot be derived from them using\nthe accepted axioms and rules. These cases are provided by some\n\u03c9-incomplete theories, theories in which for some predicate\nP the sentences \n\n\nA0. 0 possesses the given property P,\n\nA1. 1 possesses the given property P,\n\n\nand, in general, all sentences of the form\nAn can be proved, but the universal\nsentence\n\nA. Every natural number possesses the given property\nP,\n\ncannot be proved on the basis of the accepted axioms and rules of\ninference. (LGTC provides an example of such a theory.) \u201cYet\nintuitively it seems certain that the universal sentence A\nfollows in the usual sense from the totality of particular sentences\nA0, A1, \u2026,\nAn, \u2026. Provided all these\nsentences are true, the sentence A must also be true\u201d\n(Tarski 1983c, p. 411).\n\nTarski considers the possibility of adding an \u03c9-rule to the\naccepted rules of inference, that is, a rule which allows us to deduce\na universal sentence of the form of A from the set of\nsentences A0, A1, etc.\nHowever, he says that such a rule would differ in very essential\nrespects from the old rules: it is not a finitary rule, while all the\naccepted rules in common deductive systems are finitary. Also, Tarski\nimmediately takes importance away from the further suggestion of\nsupplementing the old system of rules by means of a formalized\nfinitary \u03c9-rule. He points out that in view of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness results, no matter how many new\nfinitary rules or axioms we add to certain higher-order theories, they\nwill still remain incomplete theories, in fact \u03c9-incomplete\ntheories. This discussion is enough to show that \u201cin order to\nobtain the proper concept of consequence, which is close in essentials\nto the common concept, we must resort to quite different methods and\napply quite different conceptual apparatus in defining it\u201d\n(Tarski 1983c, p. 413). The different methods and the different\nconceptual apparatus that Tarski has in mind are going to be\n\u201cthe methods which have been developed in recent years for the\nestablishment of scientific semantics, and the concepts defined with\ntheir aid\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 414; a footnote refers us to\nTarski\u2019s monograph on truth).\n\nThe best way of appreciating the nature of Tarski\u2019s theory of\nlogical consequence and how it constitutes an application of the\nmethods of Tarskian semantics is to see how it applies to a particular\nformal language of a simple structure, of a kind that Tarski seems to\nhave primarily in mind in his paper of 1936. We will choose a simple\nlanguage of this kind for a fragment of elementary arithmetic. This\nlanguage, LAr, can be given this quick description:\n\nprimitive signs of LAr: \u2200, \u2192, \u00ac, (, ), x,\n\u2032 (a subindex accent to generate variables\nby suffixing to \u201cx\u201d; let\u2019s use again the\nnotation xn for the x followed\nby n accents), 0 (an individual constant), N (a monadic\npredicate), M (a dyadic predicate).\ngrammar of LAr: Atomic formulae are of the forms\nNt1 and\nMt1t2, where\nt1 and t2 are either variables\nor the constant 0. Complex formulae are obtained by negation,\nconditionalization and universal quantification relativized to\n\u201cN\u201d.\ninterpretation of LAr: The range of the variables is the set of\nall natural numbers. N stands for the set of natural numbers and M for\nthe relation of being less than among natural numbers. The other signs\nmean what you would expect.\n\n\nIn the 1936 paper Tarski seems to be thinking paradigmatically of\nlanguages in which (as in LAr) there is a predicate (\u201cN\u201d\nin the case of LAr) that applies exactly to the individuals in the\ndomain of the intended interpretation of the language. He says\nelsewhere that the variables of such a language range exclusively over\nthe individuals of that set (cf. Tarski 1937, p. 84). (This is not to\nsay that Tarski adopts these conventions with all the languages he\nconsiders. For example, he does not adopt them with languages which,\nlike LGTC, are used to talk about arbitrary individuals, as opposed to\nspecific sets of\n them).[2]\n\nIn the considerations preliminary to the presentation of his theory,\nTarski says that when a sentence X of a formal language\n(e.g., LAr) is a logical consequence of a set K of sentences\nof that language, the argument with premises K and conclusion\nX has the following property, that Tarski calls\n\u201ccondition (F)\u201d:\n\n(F) If, in the sentences of the class K and in the sentence\nX, the constants\u2014apart from purely logical\nconstants\u2014are replaced by any other constants (like signs being\neverywhere replaced by like signs), and if we denote the class of\nsentences thus obtained from K by\n\u201cK\u2032\u201d, and the sentence obtained from\nX by \u201cX\u2032\u201d, then the sentence\nX\u2032 must be true provided only that all sentences of the\nclass K\u2032 are true (Tarski 1983c, p. 415).\n\n\nLet\u2019s clarify the sense of condition (F) with an example.\nConsider a language LAr+ which is like LAr but has besides another\nindividual constant, \u201c2\u201d, and another dyadic predicate,\n\u201cPd\u201d, whose desired interpretations are the number 2 and\nthe relation of being the immediate predecessor of, respectively. Let\nK be the following set of sentences of LAr+:\n{\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMx0)\u201d,\n\u201cN0\u201d} (these sentences are true); and let X be\nthe sentence \u201c\u00acM00\u201d. The argument with premises\nK and conclusion X is intuitively logically correct;\nthus, according to Tarski, it must verify condition (F). This means\nthat any argument obtained from it by uniform replacement of\nnon-logical constants by non-logical constants must be an argument\nwhere it is not the case that the premises are true and the\nconclusion false. Let\u2019s suppose that the non-logical\nconstants of LAr+ are \u201c0\u201d, \u201cN\u201d,\n\u201cM\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, and \u201cPd\u201d. Replace\n\u201c0\u201d with \u201c2\u201d and \u201cM\u201d with\n\u201cPd\u201d in the argument with premises K and\nconclusion X and call the resulting set of premises and\nconclusion \u201cK\u2032\u201d and\n\u201cX\u2032\u201d. That is, K\u2032 is\n{\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acPdx2)\u201d,\n\u201cN2\u201d} and X\u2032 is \u201c\u00acPd22\u201d. In\nvirtue of condition (F), the argument with premises K\u2032\nand conclusion X\u2032 must be an argument where it is not\nthe case that the premises are true and the conclusion false; and\nthat\u2019s in fact the case: the first premise is false, and the\nsecond premise and the conclusion are true.\n\nTarski wonders if it is possible to offer condition (F) as a\ndefinition of the relation of logical consequence, that is,\nif we can take (F) not only as a necessary but also a sufficient\ncondition for an argument to be an instance of logical consequence.\nHis answer is that we cannot. The reason is that condition (F)\n\nmay in fact be satisfied only because the language we are dealing with\ndoes not possess a sufficient stock of extra-logical constants. The\ncondition (F) could be regarded as sufficient for the sentence\nX to follow from the class K only if the\ndesignations of all possible objects occurred in the language in\nquestion. This assumption, however, is fictitious and can never be\nrealized (Tarski 1983b, pp. 415\u20136).\n\n\nTarski notes that in order for an argument to be an instance of\nlogical consequence it need not be sufficient that all arguments of\nthe same form be arguments where it is not the case that the premises\nare true and the conclusion false. It is conceivable that one may\ninterpret the non-logical constants of the argument by means of\ncertain objects (individuals, sets, etc.) in such a way that the\npremises thus reinterpreted become true and the conclusion becomes\nfalse, and that nevertheless (some of) those objects not be denoted by\nnon-logical constants of the language that is being considered; in\nsuch a case we would not say that the argument is an instance of\nlogical consequence, in spite of the fact that it would satisfy\ncondition (F).\n\nTo give an example, suppose that the language we are considering is\nLAr+. Since both the relation of being less than and the relation of\nbeing the immediate predecessor of are irreflexive over the domain of\nthe natural numbers, the sentence\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMxx)\u201d\nwould be a logical consequence of every set of premises on criterion\n(F): no replacement of the non-logical constants \u201cN\u201d and\n\u201cM\u201d by other non-logical constants of LAr+ turns that\nsentence into a falsehood. But clearly\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMxx)\u201d\nis not a logical consequence of, say, \u201cN0\u201d. This can be\njustified, e.g., keeping fixed the usual interpretation of\n\u201c0\u201d and \u201cN\u201d but observing that \u201cM\u201d\ncan be interpreted by means of the reflexive relation of being less\nthan or equal to; under this interpretation,\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMxx)\u201d\nis false, although \u201cN0\u201d is true. (Tarski\u2019s remark\nthat the supposition that all objects have names in the language can\nnever be realized can be justified, for example, by observing that\nthere are non-denumerably many sets of natural numbers, but in the\nlanguages he considers there are only denumerably many constants.)\n\nTarski\u2019s proposal consists in making tighter the requirement\nexpressed by condition (F), so as to incorporate the idea that a\nlogically correct argument cannot be reinterpreted in such a\nway that the premises become true and the conclusion false; in other\nwords, the idea that a sentence X is a logical consequence of\na set of sentences K when every interpretation on which\nall the sentences of K are true is an interpretation on which X is\ntrue (or, to use a common terminology, when every interpretation\npreserves the truth of the premises in the conclusion). \n\nAs Tarski says, the idea of understanding the notion of logical\nconsequence by means of the notion of truth preservation on all\ninterpretations is not an original idea of his, but one implicit in\nthe logical and mathematical practice of his time (especially among\nmathematicians interested in offering independence proofs). What is\nnew to Tarski\u2019s proposal is that he makes precise the idea using\nthe apparatus he had developed for the mathematical characterization\nof satisfaction and truth. He does not give a detailed example, but it\nseems reasonably clear how he would proceed from the indications he\ngives in (1936a), (1936b) and (1937).\n\nTarski uses a certain precise notion of interpretation for a formal\nlanguage. In our example, an interpretation of LAr is a\nsequence <A, a, R> that assigns\nappropriate objects to the non-logical constants of LAr: a set of\nindividuals A to \u201cN\u201d, an individual a to\n\u201c0\u201d and a binary relation among individuals R to\n\u201cM\u201d. Besides, he always requires that the objects assigned\nby an interpretation to the other non-logical constants of a language\nbe drawn from the set assigned to the non-logical predicate that\nrestricts the range of quantification to a specific set of individuals\n(\u201cN\u201d in the case of LAr) (cf. Tarski 1937, \u00a734); so\nin the case of LAr the individual assigned to \u201c0\u201d must\nbelong to the set assigned to \u201cN\u201d and the relation\nassigned to \u201cM\u201d must be a relation among objects in the\nset assigned to \u201cN\u201d.\n\nTarski introduces the notion of a sentential function. A\nsentential function S\u2032 of a sentence S is the\nresult of uniformly replacing the non-logical constants appearing in\nS with corresponding variables of suitable types (and\ndifferent from the variables already existing in the language). For\nexample, the sentential function determined by the sentence\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMx0)\u201d\nis the expression\n\u201c\u2200x(Px\u2192\u00acYxy)\u201d\n(in which \u201cP\u201d, \u201cY\u201d and\n\u201cy\u201d are new variables). It is equally possible to\ndefine the more general notion of a formula function, in an\nanalogous way, except that now S may be an open formula. The\nsentential functions of sentences of LAr will not in general be\nsentences, and so will not always be either true or false by\nthemselves. But they will always be either true or false with\nrespect to interpretations of LAr; or, as Tarski says, they will\nbe satisfied or not by interpretations of LAr.\n\nThe concept of satisfaction of a sentential function by an\ninterpretation can be defined using the Tarskian method for defining\nsatisfaction. Say that an interpretation <A, a, R> of LAr\nsatisfies the formula function X with respect to a sequence f\n(that assigns values from A to the original variables of LAr)\nif and only if: \n\n(i) X is Pxn (for\nsome n); or X is Py; or (ii)\nX is\nYxnxm\n(for some m and n) and\n<f(xn),f(xm)>\u2208R;\nor X is Yyxn\n(for some n) and\n<a,f(xn)>\u2208R;\nor X is Yxny\n(for some n) and\n<f(xn),a>\u2208R;\nor X is Yyy and\n<a,a>\u2208R; or\nthere is a formula function Y such that X is\n\u00acY and <A, a, R> does\nnot satisfy Y with respect to sequence f; or\nthere are formula functions Y and Z such that\nX is (Y\u2192Z) and either <A,\na, R> does not satisfy Y with respect to\nsequence f or <A, a, R>\nsatisfies Z with respect to sequence f; or,\nfinally,\nthere is a formula function Z and a number n\nsuch that X is\n\u2200xn(Pxn\u2192Z)\nand every sequence g that assigns values from A to\nthe (original) variables of LAr and that differs from f at\nmost in what it assigns to xn is such\nthat <A, a, R> satisfies Z\nwith respect to\n g.[3]\n\n\nThis is a recursive definition, entirely parallel to the definition of\nsatisfaction of formulae by sequences in the definition of\nsatisfaction for LCC in Tarski\u2019s monograph on truth, that we saw\nin section 1 above. In the same way that that definition, the one just\ngiven can be turned into an explicit one by the same method.\n\nThe notion of satisfaction of a sentential function is easy to\ncharacterize in terms of the defined notion of satisfaction of a\nformula function. Say that an interpretation <A,\na, R> satisfies sentential function X if\nand only if <A, a, R> satisfies\nformula function X with respect to every sequence. This\ndefinition is analogous to the Tarskian definition of truth.\n\nIn terms of the defined notion of satisfaction, Tarski introduces the\nnotion of a model of a sentence. A model of a sentence\nS is an interpretation that satisfies the sentential function\nS\u2032 determined by S; more generally, a model of\na set of sentences K is an interpretation that satisfies all\nthe sentential functions determined by sentences of K. And in\nterms of the defined notion of model Tarski proposes his defined\nnotion of logical consequence. A sentence X is a (Tarskian)\nlogical consequence of the sentences in set K if and only if\nevery model of the set K is also a model of sentence\nX (cf. Tarski 1983c, p. 417). Tarski proposes also a defined\nnotion of logical truth (he uses the expression \u201canalytic\ntruth\u201d) using the same apparatus: a sentence S is a\n(Tarskian) logical truth if and only if every interpretation of\nS is a model of S. Analogous notions of Tarskian\nlogical consequence and logical truth can be defined for other\nlanguages using the same method we have followed with LAr, just making\nthe obvious changes.\n\nAfter presenting his definition of logical consequence, Tarski\nimmediately adds that condition (F) can be shown to hold of arguments\nfalling under the defined notion: \n\nit can be proved, on the basis of this definition, that every\nconsequence of true sentences must be true, and also that the\nconsequence relation which holds between given sentences is completely\nindependent of the sense of the extra-logical constants which occur in\nthese sentences. In brief, it can be shown that the condition (F)\nformulated above is necessary if the sentence X is to follow\nfrom the sentences of the class K (Tarski 1983c, p. 417).\n\n\n(The proof that Tarski seems to have in mind is this: suppose that\nX is a Tarskian logical consequence of K; then there\nis no model of K which is not a model of X; so there\nis no substitution instance <K\u2032,\nX\u2032> of <K, X> such that the\nsentences in K\u2032 are true and X\u2032 is\nfalse; for if there was one such, it would readily provide an\ninterpretation\u2014constituted by the extensions of the\nextra-logical constants of <K\u2032,\nX\u2032>\u2014which would constitute a model of\nK that would not be a model of X. But whether this\nis the proof Tarski had in mind is a disputed exegetical\nquestion.)\n\nHence, as was to be desired, if the defined relation of logical\nconsequence holds for a given pair <K, X>,\nthen also condition (F) holds for it. (Although this can be shown, the\nconverse cannot; that is, it cannot be shown that if X and\nK satisfy (F) then X follows from K\naccording to Tarski\u2019s definition. But this is all right, since,\nas Tarski has already pointed out, (F) is not a sufficient condition\nfor the ordinary notion of consequence.)\n4. Logical constants\n\nTarski did not think that the construction of section 3 completely\nsolved the problem of offering \u201ca materially adequate definition\nof the concept of consequence\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 418). According\nto Tarski, perhaps the most important difficulty that remained toward\nsolving that problem is created by the fact that \u201cunderlying our\nwhole construction is the division of all terms of the language\ndiscussed into logical and extra-logical\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p.\n418). This situation is tolerable because, as Tarski says in a letter\nof 1944, \u201cit is clear that for all languages which are familiar\nto us such definitions [of \u2018logical term\u2019 and\n\u2018logical truth\u2019] can be given (or rather: have been\ngiven); moreover, they prove fruitful, and this is really the most\nimportant. We can define \u2018logical terms\u2019, e.g., by\nenumeration\u201d (Tarski 1987, p. 29). But since the division is not\nbased on a previous characterization of logical terms generally\napplicable to arbitrary languages, to that extent the definition of\nlogical consequence is not fully general, and hence unsatisfactory. In\nthe final paragraph of the consequence paper Tarski says that a\npositive solution to the problem would \u201cenable us to justify the\ntraditional boundary between logical and extra-logical\nexpressions\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 420). In fact, this is the\nboundary which for Tarski is \u201cunderlying our whole\ndiscussion\u201d.\n\nTarski says that the distinction between logical and extra-logical\nterms is not entirely arbitrary, because if we were to include signs\nlike the implication sign or the universal quantifier among the\nextra-logical terms, \u201cour definition of the concept of\nconsequence would lead to results which obviously contradict ordinary\nusage\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 418). This is so because in this case\nthe definition would not declare logical consequences many instances\nof the relation consecrated by the common usage of logicians. However,\nTarski does not seem to worry that the opposite problem may arise. The\npossibility exists, according to him, of extending the set of logical\nterms without making the definition of logical consequence useless.\nEven if all terms of the language are considered logical, the\ndefinition results in a characterization of a special concept of\nconsequence, that of material consequence.\n\nWhen he speaks of extending liberally the set of logical terms, Tarski\nis perhaps thinking of the phenomenon of what he calls the\n\u201cdisciplines preceding a given discipline\u201d in Tarski\n(1937) (see p. 80). He speaks of logic as preceding every discipline,\nin the sense that logical constants and logical laws are presupposed\nby and form part of every science. But similarly, in developing a\ncertain theory, not only logic but other theories may be taken for\ngranted; thus Tarski speaks of logic and arithmetic as a conveniently\npresupposed basis of theories for the development of geometry. This\nwould account naturally for the fact that Tarski was skeptical about\nthe possibility of finding a sharp distinction between logical and\nextra-logical terms, for it might very well depend on the context of\ninvestigation what terms and what laws are considered as forming part\nof the \u201clogic\u201d of the investigation. \n\nAn example which we know Tarski had in mind is the sign for the\nmembership relation. We find him saying: \u201csometimes it seems to\nme convenient to include mathematical terms, like the \u2208-relation,\nin the class of logical ones, and sometimes I prefer to restrict\nmyself to terms of \u2018elementary logic\u2019. Is any problem\ninvolved here?\u201d (Tarski 1987, p. 29). We may take the sign for\nmembership as a logical sign in some formalizations of the theory of\ntypes (which can in turn be used to formalize theories with arbitrary\nuniverses of individuals). But when doing set theory for its own sake,\nthe appropriate thing is not to take membership as a logical notion,\nand not to assume principles about membership as forming part of the\n\u201clogic\u201d of the theory, but as postulates thereof.\nTarski\u2019s final remarks in the paper on logical consequence again\nput forward the view that the notion of logical constant may be of a\nrelative character. In different contexts different terms may be taken\nas logical and therefore so may vary the extension of the relation of\nlogical consequence. He says that \u201cthe fluctuation in the common\nusage of the concept of consequence would\u2014in part at\nleast\u2014be quite naturally reflected in such a compulsory\nsituation\u201d of relativity (Tarski 1983c, p. 420).\n\nBut this does not mean that no desiderata could or should be imposed\non a definition of the concept of a logical constant. Many years after\nwriting his paper on logical consequence, Tarski returned to the\nproblem of the definition of the concept of a logical term, advancing\nan attempt at a positive solution. Tarski thought that this solution\naccommodated his conviction that the notion of a logical term is not\nan absolute, but a relative one.\n\nThe basis for the proposed solution appears in Tarski\u2019s 1966\nlecture \u201cWhat are Logical Notions?\u201d (published\nposthumously as Tarski 1986a). Here Tarski first makes some remarks\nabout the general nature of his proposal. He says that an answer to a\nquestion like the one that gives title to the lecture may take several\nforms. It may give an account of the prevailing usage of the term\n\u201clogical notion\u201d, or of the prevailing usage of the term\namong people who are qualified to use it. It may be a normative\nproposal, a suggestion that the term be used in a certain way,\nindependently of its actual use. As a third possibility, some other\nanswers \n\nseem to aim at something very different (\u2026); people speak of\ncatching the proper, true meaning of a notion, something independent\nof actual usage, and independent of any normative proposals, something\nlike the platonic idea behind the notion. This last approach is so\nforeign and strange to me that I shall simply ignore it for I cannot\nsay anything intelligent on such matters (Tarski 1986a, p. 145).\n\n\nImmediately Tarski makes it clear that he is also not concerned with\ndeveloping a normative proposal, but an account which captures a\ncertain common use of the concept of logical notion: \u201cin\nanswering the question \u2018What are logical notions?\u2019 what I\nshall do is make a suggestion or proposal about a possible use of the\nterm \u2018logical notion\u2019. This suggestion seems to me to be\nin agreement, if not with a prevailing usage of the term\n\u2018logical notion\u2019, at least with one usage which actually\nis encountered in practice\u201d (Tarski 1986a, p. 145). \n\nWhat are notions? Tarski says:\n\nI use the term \u201cnotion\u201d in a rather loose and general\nsense, to mean, roughly speaking, objects of all possible types in\nsome hierarchy of types like that in Principia mathematica.\nThus notions include individuals (\u2026), classes of individuals,\nrelations of individuals, classes of classes of individuals, and so on\n(Tarski 1986a, p. 147).\n\n\nHe then proposes to define logical notions as those notions invariant\nunder all one-one transformations of the universe of discourse onto\nitself:\n\nconsider the class of all one-one transformations of the\nspace, or universe of discourse, or \u201cworld\u201d, onto itself.\nWhat will be the science which deals with the notions invariant under\nthis widest class of transformations? Here we will have very few\nnotions, all of a very general character. I suggest that they are the\nlogical notions, that we call a notion \u201clogical\u201d if it is\ninvariant under all possible one-one transformations of the world onto\nitself (Tarski 1986a, p. 149).\n\n\nA one-one transformation of a class onto itself, also called a\npermutation, induces permutations of all the types in the hierarchy of\ntypes of \u201cnotions\u201d determined by the class. Thus, a\npermutation P of a domain of individuals D induces a\npermutation of the class of n-ary relations of elements of\nD, a permutation of the class of functions with n arguments\nwith domain Dn and range included in\nD, a permutation of the class of n-ary relations\namong relations of elements of D, etc. A notion or object\nO of a certain type t is invariant under all\npermutations of the universe of discourse if, for every permutation\nP of this universe, the permutation P\u0303 induced\nby P in the class of notions of type t is such that\nP\u0303(O)=O.\n\nThere is no straightforward way in which the truth-functions and the\nquantifiers (over any type of objects) are identifiable with notions\nin the sense of Tarski. According to John Corcoran (see footnote 6 in\nTarski 1986a, p. 150), in one version of the lecture Tarski indicated\nthat the truth-functions and classical quantifiers can be constructed\nas certain objects in the type hierarchy that are invariant under all\npermutations, and, in this sense, are logical notions. (Clearly,\nTarski took the logicality of these notions almost for granted, and\nwas concerned with a definition which gave some account of the status\nof other more substantive notions in various mathematical languages.)\nFor example, the truth-values \u201ctrue\u201d and\n\u201cfalse\u201d can be identified with the universe of individuals\nand the null set, respectively, and the truth-functions in turn with\nfunctions having (tuples of) these classes as arguments and values;\nand the classical universal and existential quantifiers over a type of\nobjects t can be identified with certain functions from the\nclass of sets of objects of type t into the class of\ntruth-values\u2014identifying \u201ctrue\u201d with the universal\nset of objects of type t and \u201cfalse\u201d with the\nempty set of that type. (A universal quantifier will assign\n\u201ctrue\u201d to the set of all objects of type t, and\n\u201cfalse\u201d to all other subsets of t; and the\nexistential quantifier will assign \u201ctrue\u201d to the non-empty\nsubsets, and \u201cfalse\u201d to the empty subset.)\n\nIn 1966 Tarski does not propose a definition of the concept of logical\nconstant. One such definition, based on the 1966 idea, appears in a\nbook Tarski wrote in collaboration with Steven Givant, published in\n1987, four years after Tarski\u2019s death. The main concern of\nTarski and Givant (1987) is to indicate how to develop set theory in\nseveral different languages and to compare their expressive power.\nThey define the concept of logical constant for constants in the\nvocabulary of a certain class of languages\u2014all of which are in a\ncertain sense extensions of a basic language in which they are\nparticularly interested, weaker than the languages in which set theory\nis usually developed in means of expression, and yet sufficiently\npowerful for many purposes. The vocabulary of the basic language is\ncomposed of three two-place predicate constants of the second type and\nfour two-place function constants of the third type; the vocabulary of\nthe extensions considered by Tarski and Givant can only include\nconstants of those two kinds. (However, as we will see, there does not\nseem to be any problem in extending the range of applicability of\ntheir definition to wider classes of languages.) They then prove\nseveral results about that class of languages, results that involve\nthe defined concept of logical constant.\n\nTarski and Givant introduce informally the concept of a derivative\nuniverse of a given basic universe U. A derivative universe\nU\u0303 of a given basic universe U is what we have\nbeen calling the class of all objects of a certain type, generated\nfrom that basic universe U. Thus, the class of n-ary\nrelations of elements of U (for any given n), the\nclass of n-ary relations among relations of elements of\nU, etc., are derivative universes of U. After\nintroducing in the same way as above the concepts of a permutation of\nthe universe and of invariance of a member of a derivative universe\nunder every permutation of the basic universe, Tarski and Givant give\nthe following definitions:\n\n\n\nGiven a basic universe U, a member M of any\nderivative universe U\u0303 is said to be logical, or a\nlogical object, if it is invariant under every permutation P\nof U.\n\n(Strictly speaking, since an object M can be a member of many\nderivative universes, we should use in (i) the phrase \u201cis said\nto be logical, or a logical object, as a member of\nU\u0303\u201d.) \nA symbol S of [a language in the class considered by\nTarski and Givant] is said to be logical, or a logical constant, if,\nfor every given realization U of this [language] with\nthe universe U, S denotes a logical object in some\nderivative universe U\u0303 (Tarski and Givant 1987, p.\n57).\n\n\n(i) and the parenthetical comment that comes after it embody fairly\naccurately the basic idea behind the (relativized) definition of a\nlogical notion offered in Tarski (1986a), and (ii) offers the\n(absolute) definition of the concept of logical constant. There is no\napparent obstacle to applying (ii) to wider classes of languages than\nthe class considered for special purposes of their investigation by\nTarski and Givant. It seems safe to assume that the definition can be\napplied to a large class of languages in the classical hierarchy of\nquantificational languages. Tarski and Givant themselves say that the\nusual logical constants of languages not in the class considered by\nthem, like the symbols for the truth-functional connectives and\nquantifiers, \u201ccan also be subsumed under logical constants in\nthe sense of (ii)\u201d (Tarski and Givant 1987, p. 57), presumably\nthrough some artifice in the style of the one discussed above. (As we\nwill soon see, at the very least Tarski clearly would want his\ndefinition to be applicable to some languages whose set of sentences\nis that of some formulations of the simple theory of types.)\n\nIn Tarski and Lindenbaum (1935) the authors had proved that given a\nbasic universe U, all the notions in derivative universes of\nU which can be defined in the language of the simple theory\nof types are invariant under all permutations of U. In\ngeneral the Tarski-Lindenbaum theorem guarantees that all mathematical\nnotions definable in the logicist fashion in the simple theory of\ntypes are logical notions no matter what the universe of individuals\nis taken to be (Tarski says that \u201cwe may interpret [the universe\nof the intended interpretation of the language of the theory of types]\nas the universe of physical objects, although there is nothing in\nPrincipia mathematica which compels us to accept such an\ninterpretation\u201d (Tarski 1986a, p. 152)). Since the theorem\napplies to every universe U supplying an interpretation of\nthe language of the theory of types, the definition of the concept of\nlogical constant in Tarski and Givant (1987) implies that all\nprimitive symbols denoting notions in that language (e.g. quantifiers\nof all orders) are Tarskian logical constants; also, if the definition\nwere applicable to defined symbols, all these symbols would be\nTarskian logical constants. Such results agree well with a\n\u201cusage actually encountered in practice\u201d (for example, the\npractice of the logicists, but of others as well) according to which\nthe constants of the language of the theory of types are logical\nconstants.\n\nWhen the Tarski-Givant definition is applied to interpreted languages\nof mathematical theories with undefined mathematical primitives, it\nwill generally yield the result that the notions denoted by these\nprimitives are not Tarskian logical constants. Tarski\u2019s example\nis set theory formalized in first-order with a single primitive\npredicate for membership as a relation among elements of the universe\n(see Tarski 1986a, p. 153). Obviously membership as a relation over a\ndomain of individuals and sets is not invariant under all permutations\nof that domain, so it is not declared a logical notion of the language\nof set theory by Tarski\u2019s proposed definition. Similarly, the\nclass of all sets will be declared non-logical provided the class of\nindividuals that are not sets is not empty. A predicate whose intended\nmeaning is membership (among elements of the universe) is not a\nTarskian logical constant, simply because there is a universe in which\nit denotes a non-logical object (with respect to that universe);\nsimilarly, a predicate \u201cS\u201d whose intended meaning\nis \u201cis a set\u201d (such as is used in some formalizations of\nset theory suitable for contemplating individuals other than sets in\nthe universe) is not a Tarskian logical constant, for there is a\nuniverse in which \u201cS\u201d denotes a non-logical\nobject (in such a universe, the class of objects that are not sets\nmust be non-empty). These results are again in agreement with actual\nusage, for example in the model theory of first-order set theory,\nwhere the membership predicate is taken as a non-logical constant.\n\nFrom the consideration of the examples provided by the theory of types\nand first-order set theory, Tarski extracts a conclusion that he\nwelcomed. This is the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the\ndistinction between logical and non-logical constants is relative to a\ncontext of investigation. Recall Tarski\u2019s remarks about the sign\nfor membership in a letter of 1944. In the 1966 lecture Tarski says\nthat membership is a logical notion in some formalizations of the\ntheory of types. He says:\n\nUsing this method [of Principia Mathematica], it is clear\nthat the membership relation is certainly a logical notion. It occurs\nin several types, for individuals are elements of classes of\nindividuals, classes of individuals are elements of classes of classes\nof individuals, and so on. And by the very definition of an induced\ntransformation it is invariant under every transformation of the world\nonto itself (Tarski 1986a, pp. 152\u20133).\n\n\nIt is a bit unclear that the \u201cnotions\u201d of membership that\nTarski talks about are notions in the sense introduced by him earlier\nin the lecture. They do not \u201coccur\u201d in any type, given the\nstandard formulations of the theory of types (even in formulations in\nwhich a sign for membership is used), for they are relations among\nobjects of different types, which do not occur in a non-cumulative\nhierarchy. But Tarski is perhaps thinking of some non-standard,\ncumulative type hierarchy. Under a suitable expansion of the concept\nof a notion, the notions of membership Tarski has in mind will indeed\nbe invariant under permutations of any universe, and hence logical;\nand the sign or signs for these notions of membership will be Tarskian\nlogical constants. On the other hand, as pointed out above, membership\nas a relation over the domain of individuals and sets will not be a\nlogical notion in that domain, and hence the sign for this concept of\nmembership will not be a Tarskian logical constant. Thus,\ninterestingly, Tarski\u2019s definition of the concept of logical\nconstant respects in a sense his early relativistic view in the paper\non logical consequence. Tarski describes the situation in the\nfollowing passage:\n\nSince it is now well known that the whole of mathematics can be\nconstructed within set theory, or the theory of classes, the problem\n[of whether mathematical notions are logical notions] reduces to the\nfollowing one: Are set-theoretical notions logical notions or not?\nAgain, since it is known that all usual set-theoretical notions can be\ndefined in terms of one, the notion of belonging, or the membership\nrelation, the final form of our question is whether the membership\nrelation is a logical one in the sense of my suggestion. The answer\nwill seem disappointing. For we can develop set theory, the theory of\nthe membership relation, in such a way that the answer to this\nquestion is affirmative, or we can proceed in such a way that the\nanswer is negative (Tarski 1986a, pp. 151\u20132).\n\n5. Further reading\n\nTarski\u2019s papers are reprinted and collected in Tarski 1986b. The\nvolume Tarski 1983a contains widely used English translations of his\nmain papers of the 1920s and 1930s. Givant (1986) gives a complete\nbibliography of Tarski\u2019s publications until 1986. Feferman and\nFeferman 2004 is a biography of Tarski that also contains a very\nvaluable introduction to his logical and mathematical work, including\ndescriptions of all the results and developments mentioned in the\ninitial paragraph of this entry. On Tarski\u2019s logical work see\nalso Simmons 2009 and Eastaugh 2017. McFarland, McFarland & Smith\n2014 contains a wealth of biographical and historical information\nabout Tarski, as well as updates to Givant\u2019s bibliography and\ntranslations into English of a number of previously untranslated early\ntexts by Tarski.
