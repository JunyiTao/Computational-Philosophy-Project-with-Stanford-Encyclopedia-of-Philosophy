    "main_text": "\n\nAdam Smith developed a comprehensive and unusual version of moral\nsentimentalism in his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759, TMS).\nHe did not expressly lay out a political philosophy in similar detail,\nbut a distinctive set of views on politics can be extrapolated from\nelements of both TMS and his Wealth of Nations (1776, WN);\nstudent notes from his lectures on jurisprudence (1762\u20131763, LJ)\nhave also helped flesh out his thoughts on governance. A central\nthread running through his work is an unusually strong commitment to\nthe soundness of the ordinary human being\u2019s judgments, and a\nconcern to fend off attempts, by philosophers and policy-makers, to\nreplace those judgments with the supposedly better\n\u201csystems\u201d invented by intellectuals. In his \u201cHistory\nof Astronomy\u201d, he characterizes philosophy as a discipline that\nattempts to connect and regularize the data of everyday experience\n(Smith 1795: 44\u20137); in TMS, he tries to develop moral theory out\nof ordinary moral judgments, rather than beginning from a\nphilosophical vantage point above those judgments; and a central\npolemic of WN is directed against the notion that government officials\nneed to guide the economic decisions of ordinary people. Perhaps\ntaking a cue from David Hume\u2019s skepticism about the capacity of\nphilosophy to replace the judgments of common life, Smith is\nsuspicious of philosophy as conducted from a foundationalist\nstandpoint, outside the modes of thought and practice it examines.\nInstead, he maps common life from within, correcting it where\nnecessary with its own tools rather than trying either to justify or\nto criticize it from an external standpoint. He aims indeed to break\ndown the distinction between theoretical and ordinary thought. This\nintellectual project is not unconnected with his political interest in\nguaranteeing to ordinary individuals the \u201cnatural liberty\u201d\nto act in accordance with their own judgments.\n",
