    "main_text": "The place of PIT in logical space || Alternative theories of intentionality\n3.1 Alternative theories of intentionality\n\nReductive PIT stands in contrast with two well-known classes of\nreductive theories of intentionality: tracking theories\n(Stampe 1977, Dretske 1988, 1995, Millikan 1984, Fodor 1987), which\ntake the content of mental states to be a matter of\ncausal-informational-historical links between them and things in the\nenvironment (see the entries on\n causal theories of mental content\n and\n teleological theories of mental content),\n and conceptual role theories, which take the content of\nmental states to be a matter of their relations to other mental states\nand sometimes to the external world (Block 1986, Harman 1987,\nGreenberg & Harman 2007). (See the section\n Conceptual role\n in the entry on\n narrow mental content.)\n Reductive PIT also contrasts with primitivism, the view that\nintentionality cannot be reduced.\nReductive PIT is a competitor to\ntracking, conceptual role, and primitivist theories in that it is an\nalternative account of the grounds of intentionality.\nVersions of PIT that are not reductive are also competitors to these\ntheories, but to a more limited extent: they only offer an alternative\nexplanation of the grounds of non-phenomenal intentional states. Such\nviews are compatible with reducing phenomenal intentional states to\ntracking states and similar states. \n\nWhile PIT offers a different account of the grounds of intentionality\nthan conceptual role and tracking theories, it is noteworthy that all\nversions of PIT are, strictly speaking, compatible with these theories.\nIt could turn out that PIT is true but phenomenal consciousness\nreduces to conceptual role or tracking, making both PIT and the tracking\nor conceptual role theory true. \n",
