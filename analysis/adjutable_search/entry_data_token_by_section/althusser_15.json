    "main_text": "Revisions (1966\u201378) || Marx\u2019s Philosophy Redux\n4.4 Marx\u2019s Philosophy Redux\n\nIn 1978 and as a response to what he saw, yet again, as the\ntheoretical and political misdirection of the Communist movement,\nAlthusser authored a piece, \u201cMarx in his Limits,\u201d which\nwas intended to separate the good from the bad in Marx\u2019s\nphilosophy. In his classic work (1960\u201365), Althusser had tried to\naccomplish this goal by separating out ideological concepts and by\nbringing forth the scientific ones. However, in \u201cMarx in his\nLimits,\u201d he now argued that such a method of separation cannot\nwork because\u2014within Marx\u2019s writings and throughout his\noeuvre\u2014both good and bad, materialist and idealist concepts, are\nhopelessly intermixed and many are underdeveloped.\n\nInasmuch as Althusser admits in this piece that Marx never fully\nabandoned Hegel\u2019s logic, the concept of human alienation, or the\nidea that history has a goal, the inventory Althusser offers can be\nseen as an assenting response to the charge that he had ignored\nMarx\u2019s explicit statements in order to imagine for Marx a\nconsistent and \u201ctrue\u201d philosophy. Althusser does not give\nup on the task of articulating a better Marxist philosophy, however.\nInstead, he argues that there is another, \u201cmaterialist\u201d\ncriterion that allows us to see the limits of Marx\u2019s thinking\nand to recognize those points in his work where Marx was unable to\ntranscend his bourgeois background and his education in German\nIdealism. This criterion is that of the practical success or failure\nof Marx\u2019s concepts as each has been employed in the history of\nMarxist movements. When we have made this inventory and grouped\ntogether the successful concepts, what we are left with is a\nmaterialist Marxism, a Marxism which endorses the scientific method as\nthe best way for understanding ourselves and our potential but that\nalso understands that this method is fallible. Remaining also is a\nMarxism which does not subscribe to any philosophy of history and\nwhich certainly does not maintain that capitalism will inevitably lead\nto communism. This Marxism has no system of interrelated concepts that\nguarantee a scientific analysis. Further, it possesses no worked-out\ntheory of the relations between economic structures and cultural\nstructures but for that limited knowledge which scientific practice\nprovides. Finally, this Marxism has given up the dream of analyzing\nthe whole of culture and its movement from the outside; it realizes\nthat one thinks inside and about the culture one inhabits in order to\npossibly effect and change that culture.\n",
