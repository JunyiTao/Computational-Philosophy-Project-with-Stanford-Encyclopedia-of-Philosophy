    "main_text": "\n\nWhat the ancient Greeks\u2014at least in the archaic phase of their\ncivilization\u2014called muthos was quite different from\nwhat we and the media nowadays call \u201cmyth\u201d. For them a\nmuthos was a true story, a story that unveils the true origin\nof the world and human beings. For us a myth is something to be\n\u201cdebunked\u201d: a widespread, popular belief that is in fact\nfalse. In archaic Greece the memorable was transmitted orally through\npoetry, which often relied on myth. However, starting with the\nbeginning of the seventh century BC two types of discourse emerged\nthat were set in opposition to poetry: history (as shaped by, most\nnotably, Thucydides) and philosophy (as shaped by the peri\nphuse\u014ds tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries BC).\nThese two types of discourse were naturalistic alternatives to the\npoetic accounts of things. Plato broke to some extent from the\nphilosophical tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries in that he\nuses both traditional myths and myths he invents and gives them some\nrole to play in his philosophical endeavor. He thus seems to attempt\nto overcome the traditional opposition between muthos and\nlogos.\n\nThere are many myths in Plato\u2019s dialogues: traditional myths,\nwhich he sometimes modifies, as well as myths that he invents,\nalthough many of these contain mythical elements from various\ntraditions. Plato is both a myth teller and a myth maker. In general,\nhe uses myth to inculcate in his less philosophical readers noble\nbeliefs and/or teach them various philosophical matters that may be\ntoo difficult for them to follow if expounded in a blunt,\nphilosophical discourse. More and more scholars have argued in recent\nyears that in Plato myth and philosophy are tightly bound together, in\nspite of his occasional claim that they are opposed modes of\ndiscourse.\n",
