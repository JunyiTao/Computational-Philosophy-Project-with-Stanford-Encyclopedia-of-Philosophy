    "main_text": "Implications of Moral Responsibility Skepticism || Morality\n3.3 Morality\n\nSince moral responsibility skepticism would require us to reject our\nordinary view of ourselves as blameworthy and praiseworthy in the\nbasic desert sense, critics also fear that it would undermine\nmorality. Peter van Inwagen, for example, writes:\n\n\nI have listened to philosophers who deny the existence of moral\nresponsibility. I cannot take them seriously. I know a philosopher who\nhas written a paper in which he denies the reality of moral\nresponsibility. And yet this same philosopher, when certain of his\nbooks were stolen, said, \u201cThat was a shoddy thing to\ndo!\u201d But no one can consistently say that a certain act was a\nshoddy thing to do and say that its agent was not morally\nresponsible when he performed it. (1983: 207)\n\n\nFellow libertarian C.A. Campbell agrees and asserts that denying moral\nresponsibility would destroy \u201cthe reality of the moral\nlife\u201d (1957; quoted from Waller 2004: 427). The view that moral\nresponsibility is required for morality is not limited, however, to\nlibertarians. Susan Wolf also contends that if we deny moral\nresponsibility, then we must \n\n\nstop thinking in terms of what ought not to be. We would have to stop\nthinking in terms that would allow the possibility that some lives and\nprojects are better than others. (1981: 386) \n\n\nAnd compatibilist W.T. Stace flatly states, \u201cit is certain that\nif there is no free will [and basic desert moral responsibility] there\ncan be no morality\u201d (1952). Similar remarks can be found\nthroughout the literature\u2014see, e.g., Copleston (1965: 488),\nMurphy (1988: 400), Hintz (1958), Rychlak (1979), Babbitt (1999: 88),\nand Smilansky (2000, 2005).\n\nThe notion, though, that moral responsibility is a necessary condition\nfor morality may not be as clear as these philosophers contend and is\ndirectly challenged by most skeptics (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller\n1989, 2004, 2011, 2014; Sommers 2007a; see also Haji 1998, 2002). First, it\u2019s unclear what exactly these critics mean when they say that \u2018morality\u2019\nwould be undermined by moral responsibility skepticism. Are they\nclaiming that axiological judgments about intrinsic good and evil,\naretaic judgments concerning virtue, deontic judgments about moral\nobligations, right and wrong, etc. are all undermined? If so,\nthat would be an extreme claim. Even if we came to hold that a serial\nkiller was not blameworthy due, lets say, to a degenerative brain\ndisease, skeptics contend that we could still justifiably agree that\nhis actions are morally bad (Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller 2004, 2011). Judgments of moral goodness and badness need not require an agent who is blameworthy or praiseworthy, they simply\nrequire grounds by which we can differentiate between the two types of\njudgments. If one were a Calvinist, for example, they could point the\ntranscendent moral law as a way to judge while simultaneously\nrejecting all moral responsibility (Waller 2004: 428). Less exalted\nmoral systems, such as utilitarianism or Kantianism, provide\nalternative ways of grounding moral judgments. Of course, if one were\nto adopt a Kantian test of universalizability while rejecting the rest\nof Kant\u2019s moral views (which do presuppose agents are morally\nresponsible), it would hardly be an orthodox Kantian view. But, as\nseveral skeptics have noted, the denial of moral responsibility is not\ninconsistent with the principles of Kantian moral rationalism (see\nWaller 2004: 429; Vilhauer 2013a,b; Pereboom 2014a). It is arguable, then, that\naxiological judgments of moral goodness and badness would not be\naffected by moral responsibility skepticism (Haji 1998; Pereboom 2001,\n2014a), and this may be sufficient for moral practice.\n\nNonetheless, critics might question that if determinism precluded\nbasic desert blameworthiness, would it not also undercut judgments of\nmoral obligation? Kant famously argued that \u201cought implies\ncan,\u201d and that if the moral law commands that we ought\nto perform some action, it \u201cinescapably follows\u201d that we\nmust be capable of performing that action (1793 [1998: 94];\n1781 [1998]: A548/B576). And G.E. Moore, following Kant, argues that\none \u201ccannot say of anyone that he ought to do a certain thing,\nif it is a thing which it is physically impossible for him to\ndo\u201d (1922: 317). But if \u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can,\u2019 and if because determinism is true an agent could\nnot have avoided acting badly, it would be false that she ought to\nhave acted otherwise (see Nelkin 2011: 100\u2013101; cf. Jeppsson\n2016b). Furthermore, if an action is wrong for an agent just in case\nshe is morally obligated not to perform it, determinism would also\nundermine judgments of moral wrongness (Haji 1998).\n\nThere are, however, a number of possible ways to respond to this\ncriticism. One is to argue, as Waller (2004, 2011) does, that while\nthe \u2018ought implies \u2018can\u2019 principle (OIC for short)\nis widespread and deeply entrenched, it is nonetheless false (see also\nSinnott-Armstrong 1984; Ryan 2003; Graham 2011). In fact, recent work\nin experimental philosophy suggests that the principle may not be as\nintuitive as philosophers think. Buckwalter and Turri (2015), Mizrahi\n(2015a,b), Chituc et al. (2016), Henne et al. (2016), and Turri\n(2017) have all run experiments testing ordinary \u201cfolk\u201d\nintuitions about the link between moral requirements and abilities.\nThey each independently found that commonsense morality rejects the\nOIC principle for moral requirements, and that judgments about moral\nobligations are made independently of considerations about ability. By\ncontrast, they also found that judgments of blame were highly\nsensitive to considerations about ability, which suggests that\ncommonsense morality might accept a \u201cblame implies can\u201d\nprinciple or that judgments of blame may play a modulatory role in\njudgments of obligation (see Buckwalter & Turri 2015; Chituc et\nal. 2016). These empirical findings support Waller\u2019s claim that\nthe OIC principle is a philosopher\u2019s invention infected by\nmistaken assumptions about moral responsibility (cf. Kurthy &\nLawford-Smith 2015; Kurthy et al. 2017; Cohen forthcoming; Graham\n2011; Zimmerman 1996).\n\nAnother option for skeptics is to accept the OIC principle but adopt\nan axiological understanding of \u2018ought\u2019 and an\nepistemic reading of \u2018ought implies can\u2019\n(Pereboom 2014a). On this reading of the principle, when we say that\nan agent \u2018ought to x,\u2019 we are simply making an axiological\njudgment about x and recommending that the agent perform x at some\nfuture time. When we say \u2018ought implies can,\u2019 on the other\nhand, we mean that it is epistemically open to the agent that\nshe will develop the requisite motivation to x, and in this sense\ncan perform x. Furthermore, the axiological and epistemic\ncomponents are connected in that the recommendation made by the\naxiological judgment may itself contribute causally to producing the\nmotivation (Pereboom 2014a: 140). Of course, this is not the\n\u2018ought\u2019 of obligation Kant and others may have had in\nmind, since given the assumption of determinism and that determinism\nprecludes alternatives, when one tells an agent that she ought to\nrefrain from performing an action of some type in the future,\nit\u2019s not the \u2018ought\u2019 of specific action demand, but\nrather the \u2018ought\u2019 of axiological evaluation that is\nlegitimately invoked (Pereboom 2014a: 141). Pereboom calls this the\n\u2018ought\u2019 of axiological recommendation (2014a:\n141), and it should not be understood as presupposing a route actually\nassessable to an agent, via reasons for action, to her acting in some\nrelevant way. All that is required for the legitimate use of\n\u2018ought,\u2019 on this account, is that one be unsure\nepistemically about whether such a route is accessible, and in most\nreal-life cases this requirement is satisfied since we lack certainty\nabout the future (cf. Nelkin 2014; for reply see Pereboom 2014b). \n\nFrom the skeptical perspective, then, morality is not about\nbackward-looking assessments of blameworthiness and praiseworthiness,\nsince these are rejected. Rather, morality is forward-looking and\nfunctions by invoking the \u2018ought\u2019 of axiological\nrecommendation, the epistemic sense of the notion of\n\u2018can,\u2019 and (at least in the case of Pereboom (2014a,\n2017b)) a forward-looking notion of blame grounded in the goods of\nprotection, reconciliation, and moral formation. While critics may\nfear this is still not enough since morality must be capable of\ngrounding backward-looking judgments of blameworthiness and\npraiseworthiness, the skeptic\u2019s conception of morality may\nnevertheless be sufficient for the vast majority of our moral\npractices.
