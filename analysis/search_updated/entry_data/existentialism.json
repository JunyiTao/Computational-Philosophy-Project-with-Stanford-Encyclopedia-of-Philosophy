    "preamble": "\n\nAs an intellectual movement that exploded on the scene in\nmid-twentieth-century France, \u201cexistentialism\u201d is often\nviewed as a historically situated event that emerged against the\nbackdrop of the Second World War, the Nazi death camps, and the atomic\nbombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all of which created the\ncircumstances for what has been called \u201cthe existentialist\nmoment\u201d (Baert 2015), where an entire generation was forced to\nconfront the human condition and the anxiety-provoking givens of death,\nfreedom, and meaninglessness. Although the most popular voices of this\nmovement were French, most notably Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de\nBeauvoir, as well as compatriots such as Albert Camus, Gabriel Marcel,\nand Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the conceptual groundwork of the movement\nwas laid much earlier in the nineteenth century by pioneers like\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche and twentieth-century\nGerman philosophers like Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Karl\nJaspers as well as prominent Spanish intellectuals Jos\u00e9 Ortega y\nGasset and Miguel de Unamuno. The core ideas have also been illuminated\nin key literary works. Beyond the plays, short stories, and novels by\nFrench luminaries like Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, there were Parisian\nwriters such as Jean Genet and Andr\u00e9 Gide, the Russian novelists\nLeo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, the work of Norwegian authors such\nas Henrik Ibsen and Knut Hamsun, and the German-language iconoclasts\nFranz Kafka and Rainer Maria Rilke. The movement even found expression\nacross the pond in the work of the \u201clost generation\u201d of\nAmerican writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway,\nmid-century \u201cbeat\u201d authors like Jack Kerouac, Allen\nGinsburg, and William S. Burroughs, and the self-proclaimed\n\u201cAmerican existentialist,\u201d Norman Mailer (Cotkin 2003,\n185).\n\nWhat distinguishes existentialism from other movements in the\nintellectual history of the West is how it stretched far beyond the\nliterary and academic worlds. Its ideas are captured in films by Ingmar\nBergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean-Luc Goddard, Akira Kurosawa, and\nTerrence Malick. Its moods are expressed in the paintings of Edvard\nMunch, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and Edward\nHopper and in the vitiated forms of the sculptor Alberto Giocometti.\nIts emphasis on freedom and the struggle for self-creation informed the\nradical and emancipatory politics of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm\nX as well as the writings of Black intellectuals such as Ralph Ellison,\nRichard Wright, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Its engagement with the\nrelationship between faith and freedom and the incomprehensibility of\nGod shaped theological debates through the lectures and writings of\nKarl Barth, Paul Tillich, and Martin Buber, among others. And, with its\npenetrating analyses of anxiety and the importance of self-realization,\nthe movement has had a profound impact in the development of humanistic\nand existential approaches to psychotherapy in the work of a wide range\nof theorists, including R.D. Laing, Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, and Irvin\nYalom.\n\nWith this broad and diverse range of incarnations, it is difficult\nto explain what the term \u201cexistentialism\u201d refers to. The\nword, first introduced by Marcel in 1943, is certainly not a reference\nto a coherent system or philosophical\n school.[1]\nIndeed, the major contributors are\nanything but systematic and have widely divergent views, and of these,\nonly Sartre and Beauvoir explicitly self-identified as\n\u201cexistentialists.\u201d In surveying its representative\nthinkers, one finds secular and religious existentialists, philosophers\nwho embrace a conception of radical freedom and others who reject it.\nAnd there are those who regard our relations with others as largely\nmired in conflict and self-deception and others who recognize a deep\ncapacity for self-less love and interdependence. Given these disparate\nthreads and the fact that there is no unifying doctrine, one can\nnonetheless distill a set of overlapping ideas that bind the movement\ntogether.\n\nNihilism: The emergence of existentialism as an\nintellectual movement was influenced by the rise of nihilism in late\nnineteenth century Europe as the pre-modern religious worldview was\nreplaced with one that was increasingly secular and scientific. This\nhistorical transition resulted in the loss of a transcendent moral\nframework and contributed to the rise of modernity\u2019s signature\nexperiences: anxiety, alienation, boredom, and meaninglessness.\nEngagement vs. Detachment:\nAgainst a philosophical tradition that privileges the standpoint of\ntheoretical detachment and objectivity, existentialism generally begins\nin medias res, amidst our own situated, first-person\nexperience. The human condition is revealed through an examination of\nthe ways we concretely engage with the world in our everyday lives and\nstruggle to make sense of and give meaning to our existence.\nExistence Precedes Essence:\nExistentialists forward a novel conception of the self not as a\nsubstance or thing with some pre-given nature (or\n\u201cessence\u201d) but as a situated activity or way of being\nwhereby we are always in the process of making or creating who we are\nas our life unfolds. This means our essence is not given in advance; we\nare contingently thrown into existence and are burdened with the task\nof creating ourselves through our choices and actions.\nFreedom: Existentialists agree that what distinguishes\nour existence from that of other beings is that we are self-conscious\nand exist for ourselves, which means we are free and\nresponsible for who we are and what we do. This does not mean we are\nwholly undetermined but, rather, that we are always beyond or\nmore than ourselves because of our capacity to\ninterpret and give meaning to whatever limits or determines us.\nAuthenticity: Existentialists are critical of our\ningrained tendency to conform to the norms and expectations of the\npublic world because it prevents us from being authentic or true to\nourselves. An authentic life is one that is willing to break with\ntradition and social convention and courageously affirm the freedom\nand contingency of our condition. It is generally understood to refer\nto a life lived with a sense of urgency and commitment based on the\nmeaning-giving projects that matter to each of us as individuals. \nEthics: Although they reject the idea of moral absolutes\nand universalizing judgments about right conduct, existentialism\nshould not be dismissed for promoting moral nihilism. For the\nexistentialist, a moral or praiseworthy life is possible. It is one\nwhere we acknowledge and own up to our freedom, take full\nresponsibility for our choices, and act in such a way as to help\nothers realize their freedom.\n\nThese ideas serve to structure the entry.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Nihilism and the Crisis of Modernity\nWe can find early glimpses of what might be called the\n\u201cexistential attitude\u201d (Solomon 2005) in the Stoic and\nEpicurean philosophies of antiquity, in the struggle with sin and\ndesire in St. Augustine\u2019s Confessions, in the intimate\nreflections on death and the meaning of life in Michel de\nMontaigne\u2019s Essays, and in the confrontation with the\n\u201cdreadful silence\u201d of the cosmos in Blaise Pascal\u2019s\nPens\u00e9es. But it was not until the nineteenth century that\nthe ideas began to coalesce into a bona fide intellectual movement. By\nthis time, an increasingly secular and scientific worldview was\nemerging and the traditional religious framework that gave pre-modern\nlife a sense of moral orientation and cohesion was beginning to\ncollapse. Without a north star of moral absolutes to guide us, the\nmodern subject was left abandoned and lost, \u201cwandering,\u201d as\nNietzsche writes, \u201cas if through an endless nothing\u201d (1887\n[1974], \u00a7125). But it wasn\u2019t just the rise of modern science\nand its cold mechanistic view of the world as a value-less aggregate of\nobjects in causal interaction that contributed to the anxiety and\nforlornness of the modern age. The rise of Protestantism also played a\nrole. With its rejection of hierarchical Church authority, this new\nform of Christianity emphasized subjective inwardness and created a\nunique social configuration grounded in principles of individualism,\nfreedom, and self-reliance. The result was the loss of a sense of\ncommunity and belongingness rooted in the close-knit social bonds of\ntraditional society. And the Protestant shift intensified the Christian\nattitude of contemptus mundi (\u201ccontempt for the\nworld\u201d), contributing to feelings of loneliness and creating a\nperception of public life as a domain that was fundamentally\ninauthentic and corrupt (Aho 2020; Guignon 2004; Taylor 1989).\nAlong with these historical developments, social transformations\nassociated with the Industrial Revolution and the formation of the\nmodern state were emerging. With newly mechanized working conditions\nand bureaucratic forms of administration, an increasingly impersonal\nand alienating social order was established. When Ortega y Gasset\nintroduces his notion of \u201cthe mass man,\u201d he captures the\nautomation and lifeless conformism of the machine age, where everybody\n\u201cfeels just like everybody else and is nevertheless not concerned\nabout it\u201d (1930 [1993, 15]). In their conceptions of \u201cthe\npublic\u201d (Kierkegaard), \u201cthe herd\u201d (Nietzsche), and\n\u201cthe They\u201d (Heidegger), existentialists offer powerful\ncritiques of the leveled down and routinized ways of being that\ncharacterize mass society. And the novels and short stories of\nDostoevsky, Camus, and Kafka capture the bourgeois emptiness and\nboredom of the managerial class and the paranoia and distrust that\nemerges when life is regulated and controlled by faceless\nbureaucrats.\nThese social transformations created the conditions for nihilism,\nwhere modern humanity suddenly found itself adrift and confused, unsure\nof which path to take or where to look for a stable and enduring sense\nof truth and meaning. The condition of nihilism involves the shocking\nrecognition that there is no overarching reason, order, or purpose to\nour existence, that it is all fundamentally meaningless and absurd. Of\nall the existentialists, Nietzsche was the most influential and\nprophetic in diagnosing and conceptualizing the crisis. With the death\nof God and the loss of moral absolutes, we are exposed to existence\n\u201cin its most terrible form \u2026 without meaning or\naim\u201d (Nietzsche 1887 [1974], \u00a755). And it is against this\nanomic background that the question of existence, of what it means to\nbe, becomes so urgent. But it is a question that requires taking a\nradically different standpoint than the one privileged by the\nphilosophical tradition. \n2. Engagement vs. Detachment\nFrom Plato onward, Western philosophy has generally prioritized a\nmethodology grounded in a perspective of rational detachment and\nobjectivity to arrive at truths that are immutable and timeless. By\npracticing what Merleau-Ponty disparagingly calls, \u201chigh-altitude\nthinking\u201d (1964 [1968], 73), the philosopher adopts a perspective\nthat is detached and impersonal, a \u201cGod\u2019s eye view\u201d\nor \u201cview from nowhere\u201d uncorrupted by the contingencies of\nour emotions, our embodiment, or the prejudices of our time and place.\nIn this way the philosopher can grasp the \u201creality\u201d behind\nthe flux of \u201cappearances,\u201d the essential and timeless\nnature of things \u201cunder the perspective of eternity\u201d\n(sub specie aeternitatis). Existentialism offers a\nthoroughgoing rejection of this view, arguing that we cannot look down\non the human condition from a detached, third-person perspective\nbecause we are already thrown into the self-interpreting event or\nactivity of existing, an activity that is always embodied, felt, and\nhistorically situated. Existence, then, is generally grasped not just\nthrough dispassionate theorizing but through a careful analysis of\nfirst-person experience, of the concrete, flesh and blood particulars\nof everyday life and the feelings, relationships, and commitments that\nmake us who we are. It is a philosophy that begins from the standpoint\nof the engag\u00e9, of the individual who is engaged in life\nand who confronts the givens of existence.\n2.1 Subjective Truth\nThe existentialist critique of theoretical detachment was pioneered\nby Kierkegaard whose scorn was directed primarily at G.W. F. Hegel, a\nphilosopher who adopted the \u201cperspective of eternity\u201d to\nbuild a metaphysical system that would provide complete knowledge of\nreality. By taking a disengaged and panoptic view, Kierkegaard argues\nHegel\u2019s system invariably covers over the deeply personal project\nof being human and the specific needs and concerns of the existing\nindividual. In his words, \u201cit makes the subject accidental, and\nthereby transforms existence into something indifferent, something\nvanishing\u201d (1846 [1941, 173]). In response, Kierkegaard reverses\nthe traditional orientation that privileges objectivity by claiming\nthat, when it comes to the question of existence, one\u2019s own\nsubjective truth is \u201cthe highest truth attainable\u201d\n(1846 [1941, 182]). This means the abstract truths of philosophical\ndetachment are always subordinate to the concrete truths of the\nexisting individual. \u201cThe real subject,\u201d writes\nKierkegaard, \u201cis not the cognitive subject \u2026 the real\nsubject is the ethically existing subject\u201d (1846 [1941, 281]). And\nsubjective truth cannot be reasoned about or explained logically; it\nemerges out of the situated commitments, affects, and needs of the\nindividual. For this reason, it does not disclose timeless and\nobjective truths; it discloses \u201ca truth which is true for\nme\u201d (1835 [1959, 44]). For Kierkegaard, to live this truth\ninvariably results in feelings of anxiety and confusion because it is\nobjectively uncertain; it has no rational justification, and no one\nelse can understand or relate to it. It is an ineffable truth that is\nfelt rather than known. In this sense, the existing individual\n\u201cdiscovers something that thought cannot think\u201d\n(Kierkegaard 1844 [1936, 29]). But prioritizing the contingent and\nunrationalizable truths of existence does not mean Kierkegaard is\nforwarding a position of \u201cirrationalism.\u201d He is claiming,\nrather, that the standpoint of rational detachment cannot help us\naccess the self-defining commitments and projects that matter to the\nexisting individual. Truths of flesh and blood cannot be reduced to\nsystematic explanation because such truths do not provide us with\nobjective knowledge. Rather, they lay bare the passionate and urgent\nsense of how we should live our lives. They tell the individual:\n\u201cwhat I am to do, not what I am to know\u201d\n(Kierkegaard, 1835 [1959, 44]).\n2.2 Perspectivism\nNietzsche echoes Kierkegaard\u2019s misgivings about\nmethodological detachment and philosophical systems but he does so by\nforwarding a pragmatic and perspectival account of truth. He argues\nthat philosophers don\u2019t discover objective truths by means of\ndetached reasoning because truth claims are always shaped by and\nembedded in specific sociohistorical contexts. Truths, for Nietzsche,\nare best understood as social constructs; they are created or invented\nby a historical people, and they endure only so long as they are\nsocially useful. On Nietzsche\u2019s account, truths are passed down\nhistorically for generations to the point where they are uncritically\naccepted as \u201cfacts.\u201d But from the standpoint of\nperspectivism, \u201cfacts are precisely what there is not, [there\nare] only interpretations. [The world] has no meaning behind it, but\ncountless meanings\u201d (Nietzsche 1901 [1968], \u00a7481).\nNietzsche\u2019s genealogy is one that shows how the history of\nWestern philosophy is largely a history of forgetting how truths are\ninvented. \u201cIt is only by means of forgetfulness,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201cthat man can ever reach the point of fancying himself to\npossess a \u2018truth\u2019\u201d (Nietzsche 1889a [1990a],\n\u00a793). This means human beings are already bound up in socially\nconstructed perspectives that they cannot disengage or detach from. To\nexist, then, is to live in one\u2019s \u201cown perspectival forms,\nand only in them. We cannot see around our own corner\u201d\n(Nietzsche 1887 [1974], \u00a7374). There is no aperspectival\n\u201creality.\u201d The epistemological distinction between\n\u201cappearance\u201d and \u201creality\u201d is a pseudo-problem\nthat is always parasitic on the perspectival forms that we\ninhabit.\nNietzsche goes on to suggest there is a psychological motivation in\nour shared belief in objective truth. It shelters us from the\nterrifying contingency and mutability of existence. Nietzsche\nunderstands that human beings are vulnerable and frightened creatures,\nand the belief in truth\u2014even though it is an illusion\u2014has\nsocial and pragmatic utility by providing a measure of coherence and\nreliability. We need these truths for psychological protection, to help\nus cope with an otherwise chaotic and precarious existence.\n\u201cTruth,\u201d therefore, \u201cis that sort of error without\nwhich a certain species of life could not live\u201d (Nietzsche 1901\n[1968], \u00a7493). \n2.3 Being-in-the-World\nIn Being and Time, Heidegger will expand on this critique\nof detachment and objectivity by developing his own phenomenological\nanalysis of existence or \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d\n(In-der-Welt-sein). Following the core maxim of phenomenology\nintroduced by his teacher Husserl, Heidegger\u2019s philosophy\nattempts to return \u201cto the things themselves,\u201d to not\nexplain but describe how things are given, reveal themselves,\nand make sense to us in our average everyday lives. Employing the word\n\u201cDasein,\u201d a colloquial German term that refers to the kind\nof \u201cexistence\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d unique to humans,\nHeidegger makes it clear he is not interested in a systematic\nexplanation of what we are, as if existence referred to the\nobjective presence of a substance\u2014e.g., a rational animal, an\nego cogito, or an ensouled body. As a phenomenologist, he is\nconcerned with how we are. In his version of phenomenology,\nDasein is viewed not as a substance with what-like characteristics but\nas a self-interpreting, meaning-giving activity. Dasein refers to\n\u201cthe subject\u2019s way of being\u201d (Heidegger 1927\n[1982, 123]), someone who is always already involved and engaged with\nthe equipment, institutions, and practices of a shared world and that\nembodies a tacit understanding of how to be in that world. \nHeidegger\u2019s conception of being-in-the-world articulates\nthree related ideas that will become central to twentieth-century\nexistentialism and phenomenology. First, it offers a thoroughgoing\nrejection of the Cartesian view of the self or \u201cI\u201d as a\ndiscrete mental container of \u201cinner\u201d thoughts and beliefs\nthat is somehow separate and distinct from \u201couter\u201d\nobjects in the world. There is no inner-outer dualism because the self\nis not a disembodied mind or consciousness. It is the activity of\nexisting, a relational activity that is structurally bound up in the\nworld. Thus, \u201cself and world belong together in the single\nentity, the Dasein\u201d (Heidegger 1927 [1982, 297]). Second,\nHeidegger compels us to rethink what we mean by \u201cworld.\u201d\nFrom a phenomenological perspective, the world is not a geometrical\nspace nor is it the sum of objects. It is the relational setting of our\nlives, the shared context of meaning that we are already involved in.\nAnd our involvement in the world allows objects to count and matter to\nus in particular ways. Third, Heidegger suggests that\nbeing-in-the-world is a meaning-giving activity. When we engage with\nand handle objects in the world, we give them meaning; we encounter\nthem as meaningful. What appears to us in the immediacy of\nlived experience is always shaped by the public meanings we grow into.\nThe fact that our existence is \u201cfraught with meaning\u201d\nsuggests that experience has an intentional structure; it is always\ndirected towards objects; it is about or of something\n(Heidegger 1919 [2002, 60]). The experience of hearing, for example, is\nnot a representation of bare sense data because sounds are invariably\ncolored by the context of meaning we are thrown into. We hear\nsome-thing: we hear \u201cthe thunder of the\nheavens, the rustling of the woods, the rumbling of\nthe motors, the noises of the city\u201d (Heidegger 1950\n[1971, 65], emphasis added). Meaning, on this view, is not generated by\ndetached cognitive associations. It emerges against the background of\nour functional involvement in the world, in the way we are situated and\nengaged in a shared network of equipment, roles, institutions, and\nprojects. And this engagement reveals a kind of pre-reflective\ncompetence or practical \u201cknow how\u201d (k\u00f6nnen)\nthat can never be made theoretically explicit.\n2.4 Embodiment\nWe see, then, that in their critique of third-person detachment\nexistentialists forward the idea that we are already \u201ccaught up\nin the world\u201d (Merleau-Ponty 1945 [1962, 5]). And an essential\naspect of being caught up in this way is the experience of one\u2019s\nown embodiment and the crucial role that bodily orientation,\naffectivity, perception, and motility play in our everyday\nbeing-in-the-world. In this way, philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty,\nSartre, Beauvoir, and Marcel challenge the traditional interpretation\nof the body. Against the standard \u201cCartesian account,\u201d the\nbody is not regarded as a discrete, causally determined object,\nextended in space, and set apart from the disinterested gaze of the\ncognizing mind. The body is not something I have. It is a site of\naffectivity and meaning. It is who I am. And I cannot obtain\nobjective knowledge of my body because I am already living through it;\nit is the experiential medium of my existence. \u201cThe body,\u201d\nas Sartre puts it, \u201cis lived and not\nknown.\u201d (1943 [1956,\n 427])[2]\nBy building on the analysis of the lived body (corps\npropre, corps v\u00e9cu, corps vivant,\nLeib), existentialists reveal how our moods, perceptions, and\nexperiences are already bound up in worldly meanings, how we\ninternalize these meanings, and how this act of internalization shapes\nthe way we live, how we handle the tools of daily life, maneuver\nthrough lived space, relate to others, and interpret and perform our\nidentities. In her pathbreaking work The Second Sex, Beauvoir\nilluminates this point by showing how a woman tends to internalize the\ndominant androcentric worldview, resulting in a representation of\nherself as subordinate, weak, and inferior. She is the \u201csecond\nsex\u201d not because she is born with a particular biological body,\nbut because she inhabits, enacts, and embodies the oppressive meanings\nand practices unique to her patriarchal situation. As Beauvoir famously\nputs it, the woman \u201cis not born, but rather\nbecomes a woman.\u201d This is because \u201cthe body is not\na thing; it is a situation\u2026 subject to taboos [and] laws\u2026\nIt is a reference to certain values from which [she] evaluates\n[herself]\u201d (1949 [1952, 34, 36]).\nThe existentialist\u2019s distinction between the object-body and\nthe lived-body has made it possible for contemporary philosophers and\nsocial theorists to engage the lived experience of those who have been\nhistorically marginalized by the western tradition. By rejecting the\nstandpoint of theoretical detachment and focusing on the structures of\nembodiment and being-in-the-world, influential thinkers such as Franz\nFanon (1952 [1967]), Iris Marion Young (1984 [2000]), and Judith Butler\n(1990), among others, have explored different ways in which we enact\nand embody forms of oppression and how this can shape our self-image\nand inhibit the experience of movement, spatial orientation, and other\nforms of bodily comportment. These investigations help to broaden and\npluralize our understanding of the human condition by shedding light on\na diverse range of embodied perspectives, from ethnicity and race, sex\nand gender, and age and physical ability. And insofar as these analyses\nhelp capture what is distinct about the meaning-giving activity of\nhumans, they illuminate what is arguably the unifying principle of\nexistentialism: \u201cexistence precedes essence.\u201d \n3. Existence Precedes Essence\nThis principle was initially introduced early on in\nHeidegger\u2019s Being and Time when he writes, \u201cThe\n\u2018essence\u2019 of Dasein lies in its existence\u201d (1927\n[1962,\n 42]).[3]\nSartre will later repackage this line with the pithy adage,\n\u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d (1946 [2001, 292]). What this\nstatement suggests is that there is no pre-given or essential nature\nthat determines us, which means that we are always other than\nourselves, that we don\u2019t fully coincide with who we are. We exist\nfor ourselves as self-making or self-defining beings, and we\nare always in the process of making or defining ourselves through the\nsituated choices we make as our lives unfold. This is, according to\nSartre, \u201cthe first principle of existentialism,\u201d and it\n\u201cmeans, first, that man exists, turns up, appears on the scene,\nand, only afterwards, defines himself\u201d (1946 [2001, 292\u20133]). The\npoint here is that there can be no complete or definitive account of\nbeing human because there is nothing that grounds or secures our\nexistence. Existence is fundamentally unsettled and incomplete because\nwe are always projecting forward into possibilities, \u201churling\nourselves toward a future\u201d as we imagine and re-imagine who we\nwill be. Existence, then, is not a static thing; it is a dynamic\nprocess of self-making.\nAcknowledging existence as a self-making process does not mean the\nexistentialist is denying that there are determinate aspects or\n\u201cfacts\u201d about our situation that limit and constrain us.\nThis is our givenness (or \u201cfacticity\u201d), and it includes\naspects of our being such as our embodiment and spatiality, our\ncreaturely appetites and desires, and the socio-historical context we\nfind ourselves in. But what distinguishes us as humans is that we have\nthe capacity to rise above or \u201ctranscend\u201d these facts in\nthe way we relate to, interpret, and make sense of them. If I am\ncompelled by a strong desire for sex, alcohol, or cigarettes, for\ninstance, I do not out of necessity have to act on these desires. I\nhave the freedom to question them and give them meaning, and the\nmeanings I attribute to them shape my choices and the direction my life\nwill take going forward. \nThis means, unlike other organisms, we are self-conscious beings\nwho can surpass our facticity by calling it into question, interpreting\nit in different ways, and making decisions about how to deal with it in\nthe future. This is what Kierkegaard means when he describes existence\nas \u201ca relation that relates to itself\u201d (1849 [1989, 43]).\nExistence is a reflexive or relational tension between\n\u201cfacticity\u201d and \u201ctranscendence,\u201d where we are\nconstrained by our facticity but simultaneously endowed with the\nfreedom to exceed or transcend it. The human being is, as Ortega y\nGasset writes, \u201ca kind of ontological centaur, half immersed in\nnature, half transcending it\u201d (1941, 111). We are not wholly\ndetermined by our nature because our nature is always a question or an\nissue for us. We have the capacity to reflect on and care about it. And\nthe way we care about our nature informs how we create ourselves.\nSartre will go so far as to say that human existence is fundamentally\n\u201cindefinable\u201d and that \u201cthere is no human\nnature\u201d because there is no aspect of our facticity that can\nfully describe us. Our facticity reveals itself to us only through the\nself-defining meanings and values that we give to it. \u201cIf man\n[\u2026] is indefinable, it is because at first he is\nnothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself\nwill have made what he will be\u201d (1946 [2001, 293]). This idea\nthat facticity can always be nullified or negated by our choices\nreveals the key to understanding the existentialist conception of\nfreedom.\n4. Freedom\nRecognizing that there is no pre-given essence that determines\nexistence, the existentialist makes it clear that it is up to the\nindividual to make his, her, or their own identity through choices and\nactions. Sartre explains that the coward, for instance, is not the way\nhe is because of an unstable childhood or a particular genetic makeup.\nThe coward \u201cmakes himself a coward\u201d by means of his\ndecisions (1946 [2001, 301]). In this way, the existentialist generally\naffirms the view that the human being has free will, is able to make\ndecisions, and can be held responsible for their\n actions.[4]\nBut, as we will see,\nthis does not mean that we can do whatever we want. It means, rather,\nthat existence is structured by our capacity to give meaning to our\nsituation based on the actions and choices we make as our lives unfold.\nInsofar as we exist, we are envisioning a certain kind of life,\nassigning a value to our identity, and making ourselves into the kind\nof person we are.\nWhen we become aware of our freedom as an inescapable given of the\nhuman condition, the awareness is often accompanied by anxiety because\nwe realize that we alone are responsible for our choices and the\nprojects we undertake. There is no moral absolute, divine will, or\nnatural law that can provide guidance or justify our actions. We are,\nin this sense, condemned to be free because \u201cthere are no excuses\nbehind us nor justifications before us\u201d (Sartre 1946 [2001,\n296]).\n4.1 The Anxiety of Choice\nIn the canon of existentialist literature, no writer captures this\nidea better than Dostoevsky in his Notes from the Underground.\nThe nameless \u201cunderground man\u201d rebels against an\nincreasingly scientized, rational, and mechanistic picture of human\nbehavior promoted by Russian social reformers in the 1860s, where\neverything a person does was thought to be determined by causal laws.\nFor the underground man, this view reduces the human being to a\nmechanical cog or \u201ca piano key\u201d (1864 [2009, 18]), and it\nundermines the one value that gives existence its meaning and dignity,\nthat is, the capacity to choose and create our own\n lives.[5]\nTo affirm his freedom,\nthe underground man responds to this situation through self-immolating\nacts of revolt, doing the opposite of whatever the determinations of\nrationality, social convention, or the laws of nature demand. When he\nhas a toothache, he refuses to see the doctor; when he is at a party\nwith former school mates, he behaves in outrageous and humiliating\nways; when the prostitute Liza reaches out to him in tenderness, he\nlashes out at her in rage. In this sense, the underground man is an\nanti-hero. He recognizes that freedom is the highest value, the\n\u201cmost advantageous advantage\u201d (1864 [2009, 17]) for human\nbeings, but at the same time he realizes there is no way of knowing\nwhat might come of our choices; they may, as they do for the\nunderground man, result in our own self-destruction. As Dostoevsky\nwrites: \u201cWhat man wants is simply independent choice, whatever\nthat independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And the choice, of\ncourse, the devil only knows what choice\u201d (1864 [2009, 20]).\nThis account of freedom suggests that my being (or identity) is\nalways penetrated by the possibility of its own negation because I can\nalways question myself and assign new meanings to and interpretations\nof who I am in the future. My self-interpretation is always insecure or\nunstable. I may interpret myself as a philosophy professor today, but I\nam also not a professor insofar as I can freely choose to\nreject this identity and resign from my job tomorrow. In this sense, I\nam no-thing, a \u201cbeing-possible.\u201d As Sartre puts it:\n\u201chuman existence is constituted as a being which is what it\nis not and which is not what it is\u201d (1943 [1956,\n107]). For the existentialist, anxiety discloses this predicament to me,\nrevealing that I\u2019ve been abandoned to a realm of possibilities,\nwhere I face a dizzying array of options, and I alone am answerable to\nwhatever options I choose. Understood this way, anxiety is not directed\nat some external object or event in the world. If I am an incarnation\nof freedom, it is directed at me; I am the source of it. \n4.2 Mediated Freedom\nIn Being and Nothingness, Sartre forwards an account of\n\u201cradical\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d freedom, an\nunconditioned \u201cfreedom-in-consciousness\u201d where we make or\ncreate ourselves ex nihilo, through the sheer\n\u201cupsurge\u201d of choice alone. But in the wake of Marxist\ncriticism in the 1940s and 1950s, his views changed; he realized that\nthis early account was far too abstract, interiorized, and influenced\nby Cartesian\n assumptions.[6]\nIt failed to engage the social, historical, and\nmaterial conditions that invariably limit and constrain our freedom. He\ncame to recognize that our choices and actions are always mediated by\nthe world, by the sociohistorical situation we\u2019ve been thrown\ninto. He sees that the idea of radical, unconditioned freedom \u201cis\nnonsense. The truth is that existence \u2018is-in-society\u2019 as it\n\u2018is-in-the-world\u2019\u201d (Sartre 1952 [1963, 590]). Freedom\nmust be understood as \u201cfreedom-in-situation.\u201d It is true\nthat we are free to create ourselves, but it is also true that we are\nalready created by our situation. \u201cMan,\u201d is best understood\nas \u201ca totally conditioned social being who does not render back\ncompletely what his conditioning has given him\u201d (Sartre 1972\n[2008, 35]).\nSartre\u2019s Marxist inspired conception of situated or mediated\nfreedom is one that had already been forwarded and developed by\nBeauvoir in her major treatises The Second Sex and The\nComing of Age and in her novels such as The Blood of\nOthers (1945 [1970]) and The Mandarins (1954 [1991]). The\nview is also developed by her compatriot Merleau-Ponty. In\nPhenomenology of Perception, for example, Merleau-Ponty makes\nit clear that the options we choose to act on do not emerge out of\nnothing. They are already embedded in a sociohistorical situation\n\u201cbefore any personal decision has been made.\u201d (1945 [1962,\n449]) The ways in which we create or make ourselves, then, are always\ncircumscribed by the meanings of our situation. We are simultaneously\nself-making and already made. \u201cWe exist in both ways at\nonce,\u201d writes Merleau-Ponty. \u201cWe choose the world, and the\nworld chooses us.\u201d (1945 [1962, 453\u2013454]). As we will see in\nsection 6.3, the recognition of the extent to which freedom is mediated\nby the material conditions of our situation opened existentialism to a\nbroader engagement with the social sphere and the structures of\noppression and violence that shape our experience and\nself-understanding.\n5. Authenticity\nExistentialism is well known for its critique of mass society and\nour tendency to conform to the levelled-down norms and expectations of\nthe public. Rather than living our own lives, we tend to get\npulled along by the crowd, doing what \u201cthey\u201d do. As\nHeidegger writes, \u201cWe take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as they\ntake pleasure. We read, see, and judge about literature and\nart as they see and judge \u2026 we find\n\u2018shocking\u2019 what they find shocking. The\n\u2018they\u2019\u2026 prescribes the kind of being of\neverydayness\u201d (1927 [1962, 126\u20137]). Living this way can be\ncomforting, creating the illusion that we are living well because we\nare doing what everyone else does. But for the existentialist, this\nconformist way of being is a manifestation of inauthenticity or\nself-deception because it shows how we are unwilling or unable to face\nup to the freedom and contingency of our condition; it reveals the\nextent to which we are afraid of being an individual, of being true to\nourselves, and of making our own life-defining choices.\nIn The Sickness unto Death, Kierkegaard describes\ninauthenticity in terms of fleeing from ourselves, of \u201cnot\nwanting to be oneself, [of] wanting to be rid of oneself\u201d (1849\n[1989, 43]). Insofar as we let others decide our lives for us, we live\na life that is bereft of passion, a life of \u201cbloodless\nindolence,\u201d where we are unwilling or unable to \u201cmake a\nreal commitment.\u201d (Kierkegaard 1846 [1946, 266\u201367]). Similarly,\nHeidegger will refer to this condition as a form of estrangement that\n\u201calienates Dasein from itself,\u201d where we exist as a\n\u201cthey-self\u201d (Man-selbst) that drifts along in\nlockstep with others. (1927 [1962, 254\u201355]) And this self-estrangement\nis numbing or \u201ctranquilizing\u201d (beruhigend) because\nit covers over the anxiety of own freedom and finitude.\nSartre and Beauvoir refer to inauthenticity in terms of \u201cbad\nfaith\u201d (mauvaise foi), where we either deny or\nover-identify with one of the two aspects of human existence, either\nfacticity or transcendence. I am in bad faith, for example, when I\nover-identify with my factical situation and deny my freedom to act on\nand transform this situation. I am also in bad faith when I\nover-identify with freedom and deny my past conduct and the fact that\nmy choices are limited and constrained by my situation. Sartre and\nBeauvoir recognize that the self is never wholly free or wholly\ndetermined; it is structurally unstable, it is a \u201cdouble-\nproperty \u2026 that is at once a facticity and a transcendence\u201d\n(Sartre 1943 [1956, 98]). When we cling to one or the other of these\npoles, we are denying this \u201cdouble-property,\u201d and this is a\ndenial of the fundamental ambiguity and instability at the core of the\nhuman condition.\n5.1 The Power of Moods\nFor the existentialists, the possibility of breaking free from\nengrained patterns of self-deception is generally not something that is\naccomplished by means of detached reflection. It emerges in the wake of\npowerful emotional experiences or moods. When the existentialist refers\nto feelings of \u201cnausea\u201d (Sartre), \u201cabsurdity\u201d\n(Camus), \u201canxiety\u201d (Kierkegaard), \u201cguilt\u201d\n(Heidegger), or \u201cmystery\u201d (Marcel) they are describing\nuncanny affects that have the power to shake us out of our complacency,\nwhere the secure and familiar world breaks apart and collapses, and we\nare forced to confront the question of existence. Jaspers refers to\nthese moments as \u201climit\u201d or \u201cboundary\nsituations\u201d (Grenzsituationen)\u2014situations\n\u201cwhen everything that is said to be valuable and true collapses\nbefore our eyes\u201d (1932 [1956, 117]).\nAlthough terrifying, the existentialist makes it clear that we\nshould not close our eyes or flee from these experiences because they\nare structural to the human condition. They are, as Jaspers puts it,\n\u201cimpassable, unchangeable situations that belong to human\nexistence as such\u201d (1913 [1997, 330]). Instead of turning away\nfrom this basic anxiety, the existentialist asks us to turn toward and\nface it, because it is amidst a collapsing world that the ultimate\nquestions emerge: Who am I? and What now? In this\nway, the existentialist sees the experience of anxiety and its related\nmoods as an opportunity for personal growth and transformation.\nWorld-shattering moods open me up to the possibility of being\nauthentic, of accepting and affirming the unsettling givens of my\ncondition, of being released from distractions and trivialities, and of\nrecognizing the self-defining projects that matter to me as an\nindividual.\n5.2 Kierkegaard\u2019s Knight of Faith\nFor Kierkegaard, the authentic individual is someone that is\n\u201cwilling to be one\u2019s own self.\u201d (1843 [1989, 43]) He,\nshe, or they recognize(s) that there is more to life than following the\ncrowd or chasing surface pleasures. Such a life is invariably scattered\nand disjointed, pulled apart by temporal desires and the fleeting fads\nand fashions of the public. Authenticity requires a passionate,\n\u201cpersonality defining\u201d (personligheds definerende)\ndecision or commitment that binds together and unifies the fragmented\nand disjointed moments of our life into a focused and coherent whole.\nThe \u201cunifying power\u201d of commitment is embodied in, what\nKierkegaard calls, an attitude of \u201cearnestness\u201d\n(alvor), a sober recognition that existence is a serious\naffair, not a pleasure-seeking masquerade. But authenticity cannot be\nachieved simply by means of renouncing temporal pleasures and doing\none\u2019s duty according to some universal moral principle\u2014such\nas the Ten Commandments or Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative. This is\nbecause, for Kierkegaard, the subjective truth of the individual is\nhigher than the universal truths of morality. And this means there may\nbe times in our lives where we must suspend our obligation to the\nethical sphere and accept the terrible fact that it may be more\nimportant to be authentic (to be true to oneself) than it is to be\nmoral (to do what is right.)\nIn Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard draws on the biblical\nfigure of Abraham to make this point. As a father, Abraham has a moral\nduty to love and protect his son, but when God demands that he break\nthis commandment and kill Isaac, he is confronted with a personal truth\nthat is higher than the universal. In committing himself to this truth,\nAbraham becomes a \u201cknight of faith\u201d by\n\u201cleaping\u201d (springer) into a paradox, one where the\ntruth of \u201cthe singular individual is higher than the\nuniversal\u201d (1843 [1985, 84]). As a religious existentialist,\nKierkegaard contends that this is what is required to enter the sphere\nof faith and become a Christian. It has nothing to do with membership\nin a congregation or obedience to doctrinal statements. It is, rather,\na willingness to commit to a truth that is fundamentally irrational and\nabsurd. How, for example, can one make rational sense of God\u2019s\ncommand to Abraham to kill his own son? \u201cThe problem,\u201d\nwrites Kierkegaard, \u201cis not to understand Christianity, but to\nunderstand that it cannot be understood\u201d (1835\u20131854 [1959,\n 146]).[7]\nAn\nauthentic or religious life, then, is always accompanied by anxiety and\nloneliness because the leap individualizes us; it cuts us off from the\ncomforting truths of the public and its blanket conceptions of right\nand wrong. It compels us to follow a path that no one else may\nunderstand. Abraham\u2019s decision is, for this reason, fraught with\ndespair. In his willingness to suspend his moral duty, he appears\n\u201cinsane\u201d because he \u201ccannot make himself understood\nto anyone.\u201d (1985 (1843], 103) \nBut with the despair of faith comes feelings of intensity, even\njoy, as we recognize the absurdity of religious existence, that the\neternal or divine is not found in some otherworldly realm, it is bound\nup in the temporal; that it is this life, the finite, that has\ninfinite significance. Freed from the temptations of the crowd and of\nblind obedience to moral principles, the knight of faith \u201ctakes\ndelight in everything he sees\u201d because he is now fully aware of\nthe majesty and richness of finitude. For him, \u201cfinitude tastes\njust as good as to one who has never known anything higher\u201d (1843\n[1985, 69\u201370]).\n5.3 Nietzsche\u2019s Overman\nLike Kierkegaard, Nietzsche is critical of our tendency to follow\nthe herd and cling to universal moral principles. He forwards a\nconception of authenticity that accepts our nihilistic predicament and\nrises above Christian values of good and evil. He sees these values as\nrepresentative of a tame and submissive way of being, a \u201cslave\nmorality\u201d (Sklavenmoral) that is subservient to\nauthority and bereft of any originality or style. Nietzsche contrasts\nthis with a \u201cmaster morality\u201d (Herrenmoral)\nembodied in those who have the courage to face, even affirm, the cruel\nand tragic aspects of life and the self-directed power to create their\nown meanings and values against the backdrop of God\u2019s death.\nNietzsche refers to the individual who can overcome the meek and\nslavish values of tradition for the sake of self-creation as an\n\u201cOverman\u201d (\u00dcbermensch), an aristocratic\nfigure who embodies the freedom, courage, and strength to be original,\nthat is, to \u201cgive style\u201d to life. \u201cSuch\nspirits,\u201d writes Nietzsche, \u201care always out of fashion or\nexplain themselves and their surroundings as free\nnature\u2014wild, arbitrary, fantastic, and surprising\u201d (1887\n[1974], \u00a7290).\nThe key to living with style is, for Nietzsche, a radical\nacceptance of one\u2019s existence and the world as it is,\nembracing all our strengths and weaknesses and all the blessed and\ncursed events that have been and will be. The Overman is a\n\u201cyes-sayer\u201d who affirms every aspect of his life,\n\u201cevery truth, even the simple, bitter, ugly, unchristian, immoral\ntruths\u201d (1887 [1996], \u00a71). In The Gay Science,\nNietzsche captures this attitude with a famous thought experiment\ncalled the \u201cdoctrine of eternal recurrence.\u201d Here, he asks\nif we have the audacity to live the same life we are living now over\nand over for eternity. \u201cAnd there will be nothing new about\nit,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut every pain and every pleasure, and\nevery thought and sigh, and everything unspeakably small and great in\nyour life must come back to you and all in the same series and\nsequence.\u201d On Nietzsche\u2019s view, most of us would recoil in\nhorror at the prospect of eternally suffering through the same boredom,\nfailures, and disappointments. But overflowing with amor fati\n(love of one\u2019s fate), the Overman welcomes this possibility,\nproclaiming, \u201cI have never heard anything more godlike\u201d\n(1887 [1974], \u00a7341). Camus describes this attitude as a form of\nrebellion against servile and conformist ways of being. Like the\nOverman, \u201cthe rebel\u201d is someone \u201cborn of abundance\nand fullness of spirit,\u201d and he embodies \u201cthe unreserved\naffirmation of human imperfection and suffering, of evil and murder, of\nall that is problematic and strange in our existence. It is born of an\narrested wish to be what one is in a world that is what it is\u201d (1951\n[1956, 72]).\nBut not everyone has the inborn power to rebel against tradition\nand creatively express their unique style of living. For Nietzsche,\nonly \u201cthe highest types\u201d can manifest this kind of freedom\nand capacity for self-overcoming. To this end, his account of\nauthenticity is unapologetically elitist and anti-democratic. Most of\nus are too mired in self-deception, too frightened and weak to break\nwith the herd and become who we are. \u201cOnly a very few people can\nbe free,\u201d writes Nietzsche, \u201cIt is a prerogative of the\nstrong\u201d (1886 [1998], \u00a729). \n5.4 Heidegger\u2019s Resolute Dasein\nHeidegger devotes much of the second half of Being and\nTime to an analysis of authenticity, employing the German term\nEigentlichkeit\u2014formed from the stem of the adjective\neigen (\u201cown\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d)\u2014that\nliterally means \u201cbeing own\u2019s own\u201d or\n\u201cownnness.\u201d But he sets up his analysis of authenticity by\nfirst claiming that self-deception or \u201cinauthenticity\u201d is\nunavoidable; it is a structure of the human condition, one that he\nrefers to as \u201cfalling\u201d (Verfallen). What this\nmeans is that in our everyday lives we invariably conform (or\n\u201cfall prey\u201d) to the norms and values of the public world.\nThis results in a kind of complacency and indifference about the\nquestion of existence, where we are not our own selves, where\n\u201ceveryone is the other, and no one is himself\u201d (1927\n[1962, 128]). Falling creates the illusion that our existence (or\nbeing-in-the-world) is secure and thing-like because we are doing what\neveryone else does. But, for Heidegger, there is nothing that\nfundamentally secures our existence. As a self-making activity, I am\nnot a stable thing. I am nothing, a \u201cnot yet\u201d (noch\nnicht) that is always unsettled, always in the process of\nmaking myself. The awareness of our own unsettledness emerges in\nmoments of anxiety when the familiar and routinized world\n\u201ccollapses into itself\u201d (1927 [1962, 186]), and I\n\u201cdie\u201d (sterben) because I am no longer\nable-to-be, that is, to understand or make sense of who I\n am.[8]\nLike Kierkegaard, Heidegger interprets anxiety as an\nindividualizing mood, one that momentarily \u201csnatches one\nback\u201d from the tranquilizing routines of \u201cthe They,\u201d\nleaving us vulnerable and exposed to confront our lives (1927 [1962,\n384]). And this is potentially liberating because it can temporarily\nfree us from patterns of self-deception, providing insight, a\n\u201cmoment of vision\u201d (Augenblick) that can give our\nlives a renewed sense of urgency and focus. But this experience of\nindividuation does not detach me from the world, turning me into a\nradical subject or \u201cfree floating \u2018I\u2019\u201d (1927\n[1962, 298]). Heidegger claims that our self-defining choices are\nalways guided in advance by our historical embeddedness, what he calls\n\u201chistoricity\u201d (Geschichtlichkeit). The meanings we\nchoose to give to our lives, then, are not created out of thin air;\nthey have already been interpreted and made intelligible by a\nhistorical community or \u201cpeople\u201d\n(Volk).[9]\nThe moment of vision\nshakes me out of my fallen, everyday existence and allows me to come\nback to my historical world with fresh eyes, to seize hold of the\npublicly interpreted meanings that matter to me and make them\n\u201cmine\u201d (Jemeinig). \nHeidegger refers to this authentic attitude in terms of\n\u201cresoluteness\u201d (Entschlossenheit), where I\n\u201cpull [myself] together,\u201d giving life a sense of cohesion\nand focus that was missing when I was lost and scattered in \u201cthe\nThey.\u201d But being resolute does not mean that I stubbornly cling\nto whatever possibilities I happen to choose. For Heidegger,\nauthenticity demands an openness and flexibility with how I\ninterpret\n myself.[10]\nUnderstanding that existence is a situated process of self-making,\nwhatever values or meanings I commit myself to, I must also be willing\nto let go or give up on them depending on the circumstances of my life,\nthat is, to \u201chold [myself] free for the possibility of taking\nit back\u201d (1927 [1962, 308]). Resoluteness, on this view,\ndoes not mean \u201cbecoming rigid\u201d and holding fast to a chosen\nidentity because my self-understanding is always insecure; it can die\nat any time. For this reason, authenticity requires\n\u201creadiness\u201d or \u201canticipation\u201d\n(Vorgriff), where we passionately hold ourselves open and free\nfor the inescapable breakdowns and emergencies of life. It is, in\nHeidegger\u2019s words, \u201can impassioned freedom towards\ndeath\u2014a freedom which has been released from the illusions of the\n\u2018They\u2019\u201d (1927 [1962, 266]). \n5.5 Self-Recovery in Sartre and Beauvoir\n\n\nSartre and Beauvoir follow Heidegger in viewing self-deception as\nstructural to the human condition. It is, as Sartre writes,\n\u201can immediate, permanent threat to every project of the human\nbeing\u201d (1943 [1956, 116]). Although I can certainly deceive\nmyself by over-identifying with freedom and denying the extent to which\nmy possibilities are constrained by facticity, the most common and\nfamiliar form of bad faith is when I over-identify with my facticity,\nas if I were a fully realized object or thing, a being\n\u201cin-itself\u201d (en-soi). This form of self-deception\nis understandable as it creates the consoling impression that there is\nsomething secure and thing-like about my identity, that \u201cI am\nwhat I am,\u201d and there is nothing that can change me. But to\nlive this way is to deny my freedom and transcendence, that I am\nself-making, that I live for myself\u2014or, in the\nvernacular of Sartre and Beauvoir, \u201cfor-itself\u201d\n(pour-soi). Human beings are, on their view, always in the\nprocess of making or constituting themselves, modifying and negating\ntheir being through moment-to-moment choices and actions. This means my\nidentity is never fixed or stable because I can always choose to take a\nnew path or interpret myself in other ways. Regardless of how I see\nmyself at a given time\u2014as a professor, a father, or a political\nactivist\u2014I am also \u201cnot\u201d that person, because my\nidentity is never realized and complete; I am always free to negate a\ngiven identity and define myself differently in the future. This means\nI am \u201cwhat I am not\u201d (1943\n[1956, 103]). And this situation appears to undermine the prospect of\nauthenticity altogether. If the self is always unstable, always in\nquestion, how can I ever be genuine or true to myself?\n\n\nIn Being and Nothingness, Sartre provides an answer,\nreferring to authenticity in terms of a \u201crecovery\u201d\n(r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration) of a self or way of being \u201cthat\nwas previously corrupted\u201d (1943 [1956,\n 116]).[11]\n But this act of\n\u201cself-recovery\u201d has nothing to do with creating or holding\non to a particular identity. It involves, rather, a clear-eyed\nawareness and acceptance of the instability and ambiguity of the human\ncondition. And, along with this acceptance, a willingness to act in the\nface of this ambiguity and to take responsibility, however horrible,\nfor wherever these actions might lead. As Sartre writes,\n\u201cauthenticity consists in a lucid consciousness of the situation,\nin assuming the responsibilities and risks it involves, in accepting it\n[\u2026] sometimes with horror and hate\u201d (1946 [1948, 90]). But\njust because existence is fundamentally ambiguous does not mean that\nour chosen projects are meaningless or absurd. My projects have meaning\nand value because I chose these projects, but the meaning is\ncontingent; it is never enduring or stable. In The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, Beauvoir explains: \u201cThe notion of ambiguity must\nnot be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is\nabsurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it\nis ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed\u201d (1947\n[1948, 129]). The point of authenticity, then, is not to be concerned\nwith who I am\u2014because, at bottom, I am nothing. It is to\nbe concerned with what I do. As Sartre writes,\n\u201cAuthenticity reveals that the only meaningful project is that of\ndoing (not that of being)\u201d (1948 [1992, 475]). For\nSartre and Beauvoir, to be authentic is to recover and accept the\nambiguous tension of the self, that: we are who we are\nnot\u2014and\u2014we are not who are. And by\nmeans of this recovery, recognize that the task of existence involves\nacting and doing, that is, realizing our freedom through projects in\nthe world but also, as we will see, taking responsibility for how these\nprojects might enhance or diminish freedom for others.\n6. Ethics\n\n\nExistentialist ethics generally begins with the idea that there is\nno external moral order or table of values that exists a priori.\n\u201cIt must be understood,\u201d as Beauvoir writes in The\nEthics of Ambiguity, \u201cthat the passion in which man has\nacquiesced finds no external justification. No outside appeal, no\nobjective necessity permits of its being called useful.\u201d But this\ndoes not mean that the existentialists are promoting a form of moral\nnihilism. Beauvoir admits it is true that the human being \u201chas no\nreason to will itself. But this does not mean that it cannot\njustify itself, that it cannot give itself reasons for being\nthat it does not have.\u201d It is human existence itself\n\u201cwhich makes values spring up in the world on the basis of which\nit will be able to judge the enterprise in which it will be\nengaged.\u201d (1947 [1948, 12,\n 15]).[12]\nThere is, then, a coherent account\nof ethical responsibility grounded in freedom, not as a theoretical\nabstraction but as a concrete expression of transcendence, and the\nobligation to help others realize their own freedom so that I can\nrealize mine. When I acknowledge that freedom is my essence, I must\nalso acknowledge that it is the essence of others and work, to the best\nof my ability, to help them realize it. My freedom, then, is not\nfree-floating; it is invariably bound up in the freedom of others. As\nSartre puts it: \u201cWe want freedom for freedom\u2019s sake and in\nevery particular circumstance. And in wanting freedom we discover that\nit depends entirely on the freedom of others, and that freedom of\nothers depends on ours [\u2026] I am obliged to want others to have\nfreedom at the same time that I want my own freedom\u201d (1945\n[2001, 306]). \n6.1 Authentic Being-for-Others\n\n\nSartre and Beauvoir argue that we generally exist as \u201ca\nbeing-for-others\u201d (un \u00eatre-pour-autrui), which is\nto say that I understand or see myself in the way that I do through\n\u201cthe look\u201d (le regard) of the Other. And the look\nhas the power to strip away my freedom and turn me into an object.\nHuman relations, on this account, are best understood as a form of\nconflict, a dyadic power struggle where I try to assert my freedom and\nsubjectivity by turning the Other into an object, while the Other tries\nto do the same to me. \u201cWhile I attempt to free myself from the\nhold of the Other,\u201d writes Sartre, \u201cthe Other is trying to\nfree himself from mine; while I seek to enslave the Other, the Other\nseeks to enslave me\u2026 Conflict is the original meaning of\nbeing-for-others\u201d (1943 [1956, 475]). This struggle for\nself-assertion leads to Sartre\u2019s famous claim in his play\nHuis Clos (No Exit) that \u201cHell is\u2014other\npeople\u201d (1944 [1989, 45]).\n\n\nBut the struggle to objectify and possess the Other by stripping\nthem of their freedom is a manifestation of inauthentic\nbeing-for-others. There is an authentic counterpart. Beauvoir, for\nexample, explores what it means to develop and cultivate freedom for\nothers with her account of \u201cauthentic love\u201d\n(l\u2019amour authentique), describing it as a relationship\nwhere we acknowledge and nurture the other\u2019s freedom and\ntranscendence while at the same time resisting the temptations of bad\nfaith, that is, to see the Other as an object or thing to be manipulated\nand possessed. As a moral stance, authentic being-for-others is a form\nof reciprocity that involves \u201cthe mutual recognition of two\nfreedoms [\u2026] [where] neither would give up transcendence [and]\nneither would be mutilated\u201d (1949 [1952, 667]). In this way\nauthenticity and morality belong together, whereby we have a shared\nobligation to liberate or free each other so that we can create\nourselves and take responsibility for the life we lead. Therefore, as\nBeauvoir puts it, \u201cto will oneself moral and to will oneself free\nare one and the same decision\u201d (1947 [1948, 24]).\n \n\n\nHeidegger develops a similar idea in Being and Time with\nhis account of \u201cliberating concern\u201d (befreiend\nF\u00fcrsorge), a form of care where the central aim is to free\nthe Other from patterns of self-deception so that they can anxiously\nface and create their own existence. It is a relational stance that\n\u201chelps the Other become transparent to himself in his care and to\nbecome free for it\u201d (1927 [1962, 122]). When we care in\nthis way, we resist the temptation to \u201cleap-in\u201d\n(einspringen) for the Other, as if the Other were a dependent\nthing or object that needs to be sheltered from the unsettling question\nof existence. Heidegger refers to this sheltering tendency in terms of\na kind of tacit mastery or \u201cdomination\u201d\n(Beherrschung) that strips the Other of the anxious\nresponsibility they have for their own life. Instead of\nleaping-in for the Other and disburdening them of their responsibility,\nan authentic relation is one that \u201cleaps-ahead\u201d\n(vorausspringt) of the Other, giving them back their anxiety\nand the freedom to care for and confront their condition. As Heidegger\nwrites, we leap-ahead of the Other, \u201cnot in order to take away\nhis \u2018care\u2019 but rather to give it back to them authentically\nas such for the first time\u201d (1927 [1962, 122]). Here, we see the\ndevelopment of an ethical maxim: to act in such a way as to will the\nrealization of your own freedom and the realization of freedom for\nothers.\n6.2 The Ethics of Recognition\n\n\nThere is also heterodox current among some religious\nexistentialists, one that suggests that moral demands are placed on us\nwhen we recognize ourselves not as voluntaristic subjects\u2014or, in\nthe words of Iris Murdoch, \u201cbrave naked wills\u201d (1983, 46)\nsevered from bonds of community and attachment\u2014but as relational\nbeings who are fundamentally bound together in mutual vulnerability.\nAnd this recognition may serve as the foundation for an ethics by\npulling us out of our everyday self-absorption and awakening us, not to\nour freedom, but to our essential dependency.\n\n\nSpeaking through the religious elder Father Zossima in The\nBrothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky offers a powerful indictment of\nthe \u201cterrible individualism\u201d that he sees as endemic to\nmodernity, where unfettered freedom and self-affirmation have become\nthe highest values. Such a view leads not to self-actualization but to\nloneliness and despair. The modern man, says Zossima, \u201cis\naccustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the\nwhole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in\nmen and in humanity [\u2026] but this terrible individualism must\ninevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how\nunnaturally they are separated from one another\u201d (1879 [1957\u201380,\n279]). Against the vision of the willful subject who makes choices\nwithout evaluative limits or constraints, Dostoevsky suggests it is\nonly in recognizing the Other as dependent and vulnerable that we can\ncome to recognize ourselves. True freedom emerges when we release\nourselves from the bondage of our own egoistic striving and adopt an\nattitude of humility and self-sacrifice. The aim is to show that the\nhuman being is not an isolated will but a frail and defenseless being\nthat is dependent on the self-less love, compassion, and charity of\nothers.[13]\nWhen we free ourselves from the temptations of individualism in this\nway, Zossima says a moral demand is placed on us, one where we begin\nto see that \u201cwe are all responsible to all and for all\u201d\n(1879\u201380 [1957, 228). \n\nThe Jewish existentialist Martin Buber expands on this idea in his\nmasterwork I and Thou. He claims that in our everyday lives we\ngenerally relate to others from an instrumental and objectifying\nstandpoint, what he calls the \u201cI-It\u201d (Ich-Es)\nrelation, where the other is encountered as a thing (or\n\u201cit\u201d) to be manipulated and controlled for one\u2019s own\nuse. This relation is comforting because it creates the illusion that\nwe have control of our situation. But there are moments in our lives\nwhen this illusion collapses, and we become vulnerable to the other,\nnot as an \u201cit\u201d but as a \u201cyou.\u201d In the\n\u201cI-You\u201d (Ich-Du) relation, all the egoistic\ndefenses we rely on to conceal our essential dependency and openness to\nthe Other break down. Buber refers to this as an experience of grace,\nwhere the Other is revealed to me as a whole person, defenseless and\nexposed, and I am revealed in the same way. It is a moment where\n\u201ctwo human beings reveal the You to one another\u201d (1923\n[1970, 95]). In this way, anxiety isn\u2019t a radically\nindividualizing affair, where the forlorn subject is cut off from the\nrelational world to confront their own freedom. For Buber, exposure to\nthe I-You relation shakes us out of our own egoistic concerns and\nawakens us to the fact that we are not isolated individuals but beings\nwho are always in living relation with others. With this experience\n\u201cthe barriers of the individual are breached,\u201d and this\ncreates an affective union, a \u201cbridge from self-being to\nself-being across the abyss of dread\u201d (1938 [1965], 201,\n207]).\n6.3 The Ethics of Engagement\n\nThe Nazi occupation of France, his own experience as a prisoner of\nwar, and the attacks on his philosophy from influential Marxist\ncritics, compelled Sartre to shift his focus from the individual to the\nsocial. Following the war, he, along with Merleau-Ponty and Beauvoir,\nlaunched the influential journal of social criticism Le Temps\nModernes (Modern Times), and Sartre made his aims clear in the\nfirst issue, writing: \u201cOur intention is to help effect certain\nchanges in the Society that surrounds us\u2026 one is responsible for\nwhat one is \u2026 Totally committed and totally freed. And yet it is\nthe free man who must be delivered, by enlarging his\npossibilities of choice\u201d (Sartre 1945 [1988, 264\u201365]). Here we\nsee existentialists making the connection that for the Other to realize\ntheir freedom, philosophy must engage the \u201cbases and\nstructures\u201d that limit and constrain them. This is because these\nstructures are not philosophical abstractions; they \u201care lived as\nschematic determinates of the individual\u2019s future\u201d (Sartre\n1957 [1968, 94]). Society, here, is viewed not as an aggregate of\nvoluntaristic subjects; it is the mediating background of our lives,\nand if we are going to create a situation of freedom and \u201cenlarge\nthe possibilities of choice,\u201d we must recognize how this\nbackground can be violent and oppressive\u2014especially to\nhistorically marginalized and undervalued people\u2014and to act in\nsuch a way as to transform it.\n\n\nOf all the major developers of existentialism, it is unquestionably\nBeauvoir who offered the most sustained and influential analyses of\noppression and of possibilities for emancipation, not only in her\nfeminist masterwork The Second Sex, but in her bleak account\nof the dehumanization of the elderly in The Coming of Age\n(1970 [1996]) and her reflections on the experience of Black\npopulations in the Jim Crow South in her memoir America Day by\nDay (1954 [1999]). In these works, Beauvoir illuminates how\nsocioeconomic and political structures can restrict the human capacity\nfor freedom and transcendence, how they have the power to\n\u201cfreeze\u201d the Other, strip away possibilities for agency and\nself-creation, and trap them in \u201cimmanence.\u201d But in these\nworks, Beauvoir makes it clear that this situation is not a destiny.\nHuman beings have no essential nature; no one is born inferior or\nsubmissive. We are constituted intersubjectively by growing into,\ninternalizing, and enacting ready-made structures of oppression. But\ninsofar as these structures are constituted and maintained by the\nchoices and actions of individuals, they are not fixed and static. Like\nhuman beings, they too are subject to change. Here we see how the\nrecognition that existence precedes essence moves from the ontological\nrealm to the ethical, it becomes a call to action, to engage and\ntransform the material conditions that limit the possibilities of\nchoice for those who are oppressed and marginalized.\n\nIn this way, postwar existentialism began to engage the realities of\nthe social sphere and the painful \u201cisms\u201d\u2014classism,\nracism, colonialism, sexism, anti-Semitism\u2014haunting the western\nworld. It was a philosophy that had come to recognize, in\nSartre\u2019s words, that \u201cthe individual interiorizes his\nsocial determinations; he interiorizes the relations of production, the\nfamily of his childhood, the historical past, the contemporary in\ninstitutions, and he then re-exteriorizes these acts and options which\nnecessarily refer us back to them\u201d (1972 [2008, 35]). And insofar\nas these social determinations are not fixed and timeless but\ncontingent human constructs, they can be resisted and transformed to\nfree others. \n7. Contemporary Relevance\n\n\nExistentialism has had a profound impact on how philosophers\nconceptualize and understand the human condition, with rich accounts\nof affectivity and embodiment, facticity (or worldliness), and the\nways in which we are constituted intersubjectively. It has opened new\npaths for philosophy to engage with concrete and acute human problems,\nfrom sexuality, race, disability, and old age to broader issues of\nsocial and political violence and oppressive relations in general. And\nthe movement continues to thrive in the academy today. Not only is the\nSociety for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP)\nflourishing as the second largest philosophical organization in the\nEnglish-speaking world, with smaller research groups (or\n\u201cCircles\u201d) devoted to every major figure. There is a\ncascade of scholarship published every year in leading journals and\nacademic presses that captures the enduring relevance of\nexistentialist thought, including important new work engaging the\nsignificance of French existentialism as an ethical theory (Webber\n2018), reframing our conceptions of virtue and human flourishing\n(McMullin 2019), and even addressing current analytic debates in\nphilosophies of life-extension, anti-natalism, and transhumanism\n(Buben 2022). Indeed, the core ideas and major figures of\nexistentialism are not just alive and well; they are shaping\ndevelopments in a diverse range of areas across the humanities and\nsocial sciences.\n7.1 Post-Structuralism\n\nThe legacy is most clearly present in the European philosophies that\nproceeded it. Existentialism\u2019s critique of foundationalism and\nthe authority of reason as well as its rejection of universalism,\nessentialism, and \u201cgrand narratives\u201d (or metanarratives)\nall had a decisive impact on post-structural philosophies in France.\nNietzsche and Heidegger in particular served as decisive influences on\nthe project of \u201cde-centering the subject\u201d in Jacques\nDerrida\u2019s method of deconstruction and in Michel Foucault\u2019s\ngenealogy of power, demonstrating how the subject is not the privileged\ncenter or origin of truth and knowledge. The subject is, rather, shaped\nin advance by sociohistorical structures, an overlapping network of\nnorms and practices, linguistic conventions, and shared meanings, and\nthis shaping takes place in a way that we are never fully\nconscious\n of.[14]\nThe\nindividual, on this view, is more of a placeholder or crossing point in\nthese anonymous structures, where the subject exists as \u201cthe\ninscribed surface of events [\u2026] totally imprinted by\nhistory\u201d (Foucault 1977, 148). Of course, existentialists reject\nthe idea that this historical imprinting or \u201cdecentering\u201d\nis total or absolute. They are, after all, still committed to the value\nof freedom and authenticity, but they recognize that freedom is never\nunconditioned. Beyond the philosophies of Heidegger and Nietzsche, we\nsee this recognition in Merleau-Ponty\u2019s conception of mediated\nfreedom, in Sartre\u2019s postwar account of\n\u201cfreedom-in-situation,\u201d and in what Beauvoir calls\n\u201cla force des choses\u201d (the power of\ncircumstances). The recognition of historicity as an impersonal force\nthat structures our identity had such an impact on Foucault\u2019s\nwork that he once remarked: \u201cMy entire philosophical development\nwas determined by my reading of Heidegger\u201d (Foucault 1985, cited\nin Dreyfus 1995, 9).\n7.2 Narrative and Hermeneutic Philosophy\n\n\nIn viewing the self not as a substance or thing but as a\nself-interpreting, meaning-giving activity that is always already bound\nup in the world, existentialism has also informed key developments in\nnarrative and hermeneutic philosophy. Prominent anglophone philosophers\nsuch as Harry Frankfurt (1971), Charles Taylor (1985), and Alasdair\nMacIntyre (1981) have drawn on classical existentialism to illuminate\nhow we exist in the meanings and self-interpretations that we create\nfor ourselves. My sense of who I am is constituted by an ongoing\nprocess of choosing, pulling together, and consolidating the roles,\nprojects, and meanings that matter to me and that are made available by\nthe sociohistorical situation I find myself in. On this view, the story\nI create for myself is held together by the narrative unity and\ncohesion that I give to it. This is what Taylor means when he says that\nwe can only understand or \u201cgrasp our lives in a narrative\u201d\n(1989, 47). And this conception of narrative identity not only offers a\nresponse to overly reductive conceptions of the self that are grounded\nin the substance ontologies of mind and body; it demonstrates an\nattentiveness to the ambiguous tension of our condition, that our\nchoices are both self-fashioning and socially embedded, that we\nsimultaneously make ourselves and are already made. \n7.3 Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science\n\nBeginning with Hubert Dreyfus\u2019s (1972) groundbreaking critique\nof Artificial Intelligence (AI), philosophers of mind and cognitive\nscientists have been drawing on existentialist\nphilosophy\u2014especially Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty\u2014to\nchallenge the overly mentalistic picture of selfhood and agency that\nmodern philosophy inherits from Descartes and Kant and to dismantle\ntraditional representational theories of knowledge. Key works by Shaun\nGallagher (2005), Thomas Fuchs, (2018), and Dan Zahavi (2005) have\nreplaced the picture of the disembodied mind with the now widely\naccepted notion of the embedded, enactive, and embodied self. This is a\nrejection of the long-held assumption that human action must somehow be\nrepresented or \u201cmirrored\u201d in the mind. Existentialism\nilluminates how\u2014as a situated way of\nbeing-in-the-world\u2014human beings already embody a tacit\nunderstanding of the world in a way that we are not and can never be\nthematically conscious of. This means we do not understand things as\ndiscrete objects. We understand things in terms of how we use and\nhandle them and in terms of the purposive, meaning-giving roles these\nthings play in our everyday lives. The traditional view of the mind as\nsomething resembling the rule-governed processes of a computer program\nhave continually failed to capture this ambiguous and embodied sense of\nbeing-in-the-world.\n7.4 Critical Phenomenology\n\nThe attentiveness to conditions of oppression, subjugation, and\nviolence among postwar existentialists in France has had a decisive\nimpact on recent developments in critical phenomenology by giving voice\nto those who have been historically marginalized or undervalued in the\nwestern tradition. Beauvoir\u2019s pioneering account of the\nwoman\u2019s experience in The Second Sex is well known for\nlaying the conceptual foundations for second wave feminism, and her\nlate career phenomenology of aging broke new ground by shedding light\non the existence of older persons and exposing the toxic ageism in\ncontemporary capitalist societies. Together with Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty, her ideas would inform Franz Fanon\u2019s Black\nSkin, White Masks (1952 [1967]), a seminal work that disclosed the\ndehumanizing experience of colonized Black populations and helped give\nbirth to Africana critical theory or \u201cblack existentialism\u201d\n(Gordon 2000). The focus on the ways in which structures of\ndiscrimination along with the limits of our own embodiment can\nconstrain our capacities for freedom and transcendence has, in turn,\ninfluenced recent phenomenological accounts of intersectionality and\nthe lived experience of, among others, indigenous peoples, immigrants,\nand exiles (Coulthard 2014; Ortega 2016), queer and trans identities\n(Ahmed 2006; Salamon 2010), those who are imprisoned or in solitary\nconfinement (Guenther 2013; Leder 2016), and the elderly, disabled, and\nchronically ill (Aho 2022; Reynolds 2022; Dickel 2022).\n7.5 Comparative and Environmental Philosophy\n\nInterpreting existence in terms of the situated activity of\nbeing-in-the-world not only serves as a rejection of substance ontology\nand the metaphysical dualisms (subject-object; mind-body; inner-outer)\nthat we inherit from Cartesian and empiricist epistemologies; it also\nreveals deep affinities with the nonduality of Buddhism and other\nincarnations of Eastern thought. (Loy 2018; Kalmanson 2020) And the\nrecognition of our enmeshment in the world has informed a range of\nimportant advances in the philosophy of place, deep ecology, and\neco-phenomenology (Brown & Toadvine 2003; Malpas 2017; Morton 2016;\nRentmeester 2016). These endeavors have exposed the limitations of the\nscientific worldview and our uncritical dependence on technological\ninnovation to address the current ecological crisis. Modern science\ngenerally assumes a binary paradigm of the subject as separate and\ndistinct from a value-less domain of objects (or nature), a domain that\ncan, in turn, be mastered and controlled by technoscience. In this way,\nit betrays our ordinary experience, that in our day-to-day lives we are\nnot atomistic, self-certain subjects but beings that are fundamentally\nentwined with the world and the meaning and value that this\nintertwining brings to our experience. For the existentialist, then,\nextricating ourselves from environmental doom requires not a\ntechnoscientific fix but an ontological transformation in our own\nself-understanding, an awaking to the reality of our interdependence\nwith nature, that the earth is not apart from us but rather\npart of us. \n7.6 Philosophy of Health and Illness\n\n\nOutside of the humanities and social sciences, existentialism has\nalso had a deep and lasting impact on the allied health professions.\nThe role it has played in the development of existential and humanistic\napproaches to psychotherapy (Cooper 2003; Spinneli 2007; van Deurzen\n2015) and to phenomenological psychopathology (Parnas & Gallagher\n2015; Ratcliffe 2015; Stanghellini et al. 2019) is well-known, but in\nrecent years we have seen its influence emerge in a range of different\nareas, from narrative medicine to nursing, and from gerontology to\npalliative care. To this end, existentialism has informed a move away\nfrom the reductive and objectifying tendencies of modern biomedicine to\nrecover the first-person experience of health and illness, viewing the\nbody not so much as a biophysical machine that needs to be adjusted and\nmaintained but as the experiential and interpretative medium of our\nexistence. This shift has not only allowed clinicians to challenge the\nemergent tendency to medicalize ever-expanding swaths of the human\ncondition; it makes it possible for the clinician to better understand\nthe patient\u2019s experience by getting a sense of \u201cwhat it\nmeans\u201d and \u201cwhat it feels like\u201d to suffer when the\nbody breaks down (Aho 2018; Slatman 2014; Svenaeus 2022; Zeiler &\nK\u00e4ll 2014).\n7.7 A New Generation\n\nBeyond its ascendency in the healing arts, its myriad cultural\ninfluences, and its wide-ranging impact on the humanities and social\nsciences, the enduring legacy of existentialism is perhaps most visible\nin the classroom. Existentialist-themed courses are often among the\nmost popular in the philosophy curriculum as young students confront,\nfor the first time, the unsettling questions of freedom and the meaning\nof their own existence. And these questions have never been more\npressing as they develop against the backdrop of anthropogenic climate\nchange, species extinction, global pandemics, and the reemergence of\nauthoritarian and fascist politics. Amidst these planetary emergencies,\na new generation is facing the predicament of nihilism and the death of\nGod and owning up to the uncanny truth of the human condition: that\nexistence precedes essence.\n",
