    "main_text": "Consciousness, Mind, and Personal Identity || Witnessing Consciousness\n3.1 Witnessing Consciousness\n\nFrom the standpoint of individual experience, witnessing consciousness\nis the locus of one\u2019s subjective being, the basic sense of\nself-existence, and the foundation of self-identity. It is the glue\nthat unifies disparate forms of experience like waking, dreaming, and\ndifferent modes of perception, and it accounts for memory and\ndiachronic personal identity (BrS\u016bBh 2.3.31; B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7).\nThis consciousness is distinct from an autobiographical sense of self\nconstructed through recollective memory traces. \u015aa\u1e45kara\ndistinguishes witnessing consciousness from the mind, mental\nqualities, and cognitive modes. Consciousness is not composed of\nphysical materials, structures, or processes, whereas the mind is\ncomposed of inert subtle matter. Consciousness is not an emergent\nproperty of the brain and body, which are composed of inert coarse\nmatter, because that which is inert cannot give rise to sentiency.\n(See Ram-Prasad 2001a on Advaita\u2019s consciousness and\ncontemporary physicalism).\n\nWitnessing consciousness always accompanies cognition (see, e.g.,\nB\u1e5bUBh 1.4.10; KeUBh 1.2, 2.4). When one\u2019s mind assumes the\nform of intentional objects, the cognition is immediately manifested\nas known in the presence of witnessing consciousness. Consciousness\nillumines cognitions directly with infallible access and without the\nmediation of another mental mode. It reveals first order states of\ncognition, including sense perception and internal states such as\naffect and imagination; as well as second order states such as\nintrospection and meta-cognitive monitoring. Yet the witness is not\nitself a meta-function of the mind, such as an inner sense, a higher\norder cognition, or an introspective awareness that deliberately\nrecognizes the fact of one\u2019s experience. The witness is not a\nseparate substantial entity at all according to \u015aa\u1e45kara,\nnor does it possess agency in revealing cognition as a knower. It is\nintransitive and receptive, simply the passive witnessing itself\n(B\u1e5bUBh 1.4.10; TaiUBh 2.1.1; KeUBh 2.4). Only the mind possesses\nobject directed intentionality, not witnessing consciousness. (See\nGupta 1998 and Fort 1984 on witnessing consciousness. See Albahari\n2009; and Fasching 2011 and 2012 for contextualizing witnessing\nconsciousness in contemporary philosophy of mind).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara understands consciousness as immediately evident,\nyet outside the scope of any means of knowledge. As the illuminating\nbackground of all phenomenal states, witnessing consciousness is the\npresupposition of all epistemological knowing. It is intrinsically\nfirst-personal. Consciousness is therefore not objectifiable (KeUBh\n2.1). This conclusion further entails that it is unaffected by what it\nillumines and remains untouched by mental states. Consciousness does\nnot undergo any causation whatsoever because causation must presuppose\nits object-hood status.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara views witnessing consciousness as invariable\ndespite the fluctuations of mental modes. One foundational argument\nfor this is his analysis of waking, dreaming, and deep dreamless sleep\nstates based on the B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka and\nM\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya Upani\u1e63ads. He considers\nthese three mental states as exhaustive of human experience, and\nclaims that consciousness persists constantly through all three\ndespite their mutual exclusivity. When awakening from a dream state,\nthough the dream world and dream body discontinue, there is no rupture\nto the continuity of one\u2019s consciousness. Consciousness\ncontinues seamlessly even in deep dreamless sleep where ego and agency\nresolve into an unmanifest state and subject-object distinctions\ncollapse.\n\nOne might object that persistence of consciousness in deep sleep is\nnot possible given the mainstream premise of identifying consciousness\nas intentional experience. \u015aa\u1e45kara disagrees with the\npremise that consciousness is intrinsically intentional. (This was a\nmatter of great debate between Advaita Ved\u0101nta and rival\nphilosophies like Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika). He counters that\nthe absence of intentional experience in deep sleep does not entail\nthe lack of consciousness insofar as consciousness is not\nintrinsically intentional. It exists even in the absence of cognition\nrepresenting an object. Rejecting his position is difficult because\none cannot claim direct perception of unconsciousness in deep sleep,\nand in that case cannot inductively infer unconsciousness either.\nRather than viewing deep sleep as the absence of consciousness,\n\u015aa\u1e45kara claims there is simply an absence of objects.\nConsciousness of the absence of objects is not the absence of\nconsciousness. This is akin to having one\u2019s eyes wide open and\nseeing but in a pitch-black room. Consciousness simply has nothing to\nillumine, therefore no intentional experience occurs nor any awareness\nof one\u2019s self as a knower. This presence of consciousness in\ndeep sleep is possible because it is self-illuminating and exists\nindependently from objects or knowing agents. (See\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s discussions of deep sleep in B\u1e5bUBh\n4.3, GKBh ch.1, and BrS\u016bBh 3.2.7\u201310. For further studies\nsee Thompson 2015; Comans 1990; and Sharma 2004).\n",
