    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Responsibility Skepticism || Hard Incompatibilism\n2.2 Hard Incompatibilism\n\nOne of these positions is hard incompatibilism, which\nmaintains that whatever the fundamental nature of reality, whether it\nis deterministic or indeterministic, we lack basic desert\nmoral responsibility. Hard incompatibilism amounts to a rejection of\nboth compatibilism and libertarianism. It maintains that the sort of\nfree will required for basic desert moral responsibility is\nincompatible with causal determination by factors beyond the\nagent\u2019s control and also with the kind of indeterminism\nin action required by the most plausible versions of libertarianism\n(see Pereboom 2001, 2014a).\n\nThe argument for hard incompatibilism can be sketched as follows:\nAgainst the view that free will is compatible with the causal\ndetermination of our actions by natural factors beyond our control\n(i.e., compatibilism), most hard incompatibilists maintain that there\nis no relevant difference between this prospect and our actions being\ncausally determined by manipulators (e.g., Pereboom 2001, 2014a). [For\nadditional arguments against compatibilism, see the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism.]\n Against event-causal libertarianism, hard incompatibilists\ngenerally advance the \u201cluck\u201d or \u201cdisappearing\nagent\u201d objection, according to which agents are left unable to\nsettle whether a decision/action occurs and hence cannot have\nthe control in action required for moral responsibility (Pereboom\n2001, 2014a; 2017c; Waller 1990, 2011, N. Levy 2008, 2011; for\nnon-skeptics who advance similar objections see Ekstrom 2000; Mele\n1999a, 2017; Haji 2001). The same problem, they contend, arises for\nnon-causal libertarian accounts since these too fail to\nprovide agents with the control in action needed for basic desert\n(Pereboom 2014a). While agent-causal libertarianism could, in\ntheory, supply this sort of control, hard incompatibilists argue that\nit cannot be reconciled with our best physical theories (Pereboom\n2001, 2014a; Waller 2011; Harris 2012; cf. N. Levy 2011)\nand faces additional problems accounting for mental causation. Since this exhausts the options for views on which we have the sort of free will needed for basic desert moral responsibility, hard incompatibilists conclude that moral responsibility skepticism is the\nonly remaining position.\n\nCritics of hard incompatibilism include both compatibilists and\nlibertarians. See, for example, the entries on\n compatibilism,\n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will, and\n arguments for incompatibilism.\n I will here only briefly discuss one possible compatibilist\nreply\u2014the attempt to block the conclusion of the manipulation\nargument, one of the main arguments employed by hard incompatibilists\nand other incompatibilists.\n\nMost manipulation arguments introduce various science-fiction-like\nscenarios, or manipulation cases, aimed to show that agents who meet\nall the various compatibilist conditions for moral responsibility can\nnevertheless be subject to responsibility-undermining manipulation.\nThese arguments further maintain that these manipulation cases\nresemble in the relevant ways agents in the normal (non-manipulated)\ndeterministic case. They go on to conclude that if agents fail to be\nmorally responsible in the manipulated cases they also fail to be\nmorally responsible in the normal deterministic case (see Pereboom\n1995, 2001, 2014a; Mele 2008; Todd 2013; for a less demanding version\nof the argument, one that aims to show only that the manipulation in\nquestion is mitigating with respect to moral responsibility,\nsee Todd 2011). \n\nConsider, for example, Pereboom\u2019s famous \u201cfour-case\u201d\nargument. The argument sets out three examples of actions that involve\nmanipulation, the first of which features the most radical sort of\nmanipulation consistent with all the leading compatibilist conditions,\neach progressively more like the fourth, which is an ordinary case of\naction causally determined in a natural way. The challenge is for the\ncompatibilist to point out a relevant and principled difference\nbetween any two adjacent cases that would show why the agent might be\nmorally responsible in the latter example but not the former. Here,\nfor instance, is the second case:\n\n\nPlum is just like an ordinary human being, except that a team of\nneuroscientists programmed him at the beginning on his life so that\nhis reasoning is often but not always egoistic, and at times strongly\nso, with the intended consequence that in his current circumstances he\nis causally determined to engage in the egoistic reasons-responsive\nprocess of deliberation and to have the set of first and second-order\ndesires that result in his decision to kill White. Plum has the\ngeneral ability to regulate his actions by moral reasons, but in his\ncircumstances, due to the strongly egoistic nature of his deliberative\nreasoning, he is causally determined to make his decision to kill. Yet\nhe does not decide as he does because of an irresistible desire.\n(2014a: 77)\n\n\nIs Plum morally responsible in the basic desert sense for killing\nWhite? Defenders of manipulation arguments say \u201cno.\u201d They\nfurther argue that there is no relevant difference between this case\nand mere causal determinism. By comparing this case to the other three\ncases\u2014the final case being just like the above except that\nnatural deterministic causes have taken the place of the\nneuroscientists\u2014Pereboom and others argue that it is simply\nirrelevant whether Plum\u2019s psychological states\nultimately trace back to intentional agents or non-intentional causes.\nWhat does matter, and what is responsibility-undermining, is that in\nall four cases the agent\u2019s actions are ultimately the result of\nfactors beyond their control.\n\nIn response, compatibilists adopt either hard-line or\nsoft-line replies (see McKenna 2008). Hard-line replies grant\nthat there is no relevant difference between agents in the various\nmanipulated scenarios and ordinary (non-manipulated) agents in\ndeterministic settings, rather they attack the intuition that agents\nare not morally responsible in the manipulated cases. They maintain\nthat as long as the various compatibilist conditions for moral\nresponsibility are satisfied, manipulated agents are just as free and\nmorally responsible as determined agents\u2014despite what might be\nour initial intuition. Soft-line replies, on the other hand, try to\ndifferentiate between the various cases. They search for relevant\ndifferences between the cases, differences that would account for why\nmanipulated agents are not free and morally responsible, but\nnon-manipulated and causally determined agents are. There are,\nhowever, problems with both types of replies.\n\nThe main worry people have with the hard-line approach is that it\nconflicts too deeply with our intuitions about the relevant class of\nmanipulation cases (Capes, forthcoming). Many people find it highly\nimplausible that someone like Plum could be morally responsible in the\nbasic desert sense for his behavior given how the behavior came about\n(cf. Fischer 2011, 2014; McKenna 2008, 2014, 2017; Sartorio 2016;\nTierney 2013, 2014; Capes 2013; Haji & Cuypers 2006). The main\nworry with the soft-line approach, on the other hand, is that any\ndifference identified as the relevant one between manipulated agents\nand ordinary determined agents may be a difference that applies only\nto current manipulation cases but not future cases. For example, most\nextant manipulation cases involve external agents who act as\nintentional manipulators, whereas this is missing in the normal case\nof natural determinism. Proponents of soft-line replies might\ntherefore be tempted to point to this as the relevant difference.\nSetting aside for the moment the potential question-begging nature of\nthis move, the reply also suffers from the fact that new manipulation\narguments have recently been devised that avoid external agents\naltogether.\n\nA similar problem confronts soft-line replies that point to\nresponsibility-conferring conditions not specified in a particular\nmanipulation case (Lycan 1987; Baker 2006; Feltz 2012; Murray &\nLombrozo 2017). That is, even if one could point to a relevant\ndifference between an agent in an extant manipulation case and an\nagent in the naturally-determined case, this may only serve as an\ninvitation for proponents of the manipulation argument to revise the\nvignette on which their argument is based so that the agent now\nsatisfies the relevant condition on which the soft-liner insists\n(Capes, forthcoming). The challenge, then, for defenders of the\nsoft-line approach is to show that there is some kind of requirement\nfor free action and moral responsibility that can be satisfied by\nagents in deterministic settings but which cannot (in principle) be\nsatisfied by agents in manipulation cases. [For a recent attempt at\nsatisfying this challenge, see Deery and Nahmias (2017); for a reply,\nsee Capes (forthcoming).] \n",
