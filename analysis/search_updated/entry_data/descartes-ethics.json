    "preamble": "\n\nDescartes is not well known for his contributions to ethics. Some have\ncharged that it is a weakness of his philosophy that it focuses\nexclusively on metaphysics and epistemology to the exclusion of moral\nand political philosophy. Such criticisms rest on a misunderstanding\nof the broader framework of Descartes\u2019 philosophy. Evidence of\nDescartes\u2019 concern for the practical import of philosophy can be\ntraced to his earliest writings. In agreement with the ancients, he\nidentifies the goal of philosophy with the attainment of a wisdom that\nis sufficient for happiness. The details of this position are\ndeveloped most fully in writings from the latter part of\nDescartes\u2019 career: his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth,\nThe Passions of the Soul, and the preface to the French\ntranslation of the Principles of Philosophy, where he\npresents his famous image of the tree of philosophy, whose uppermost\nbranch is \u201cthe highest and most perfect moral system, which\npresupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences and is the\nultimate level of wisdom.\u201d\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Place of Ethics in Descartes\u2019 Philosophy\n\nDescartes did not write extensively on ethics, and this has led some\nto assume that the topic lacks a place within his philosophy. This\nassumption has been bolstered by the tendency, prevalent until\nrecently, to base an understanding of Descartes\u2019 philosophy\nprimarily on his two most famous books, Discourse on the\nMethod and Meditations on First Philosophy. Although\nboth works offer insight into Descartes\u2019 ethics, neither\npresents his position in detail. (For comprehensive treatments of\nDescartes\u2019 ethical thought, see Kambouchner 2009; Marshall 1998;\nMorgan 1994; Rodis-Lewis 1970.)\n\nDescartes\u2019 writings reveal a consistent conception of\nphilosophy\u2019s goal. In the first rule of the unfinished Rules\nfor the Direction of the Mind, he states: \u201cThe aim of our\nstudies should be to direct the mind with a view to forming true and\nsound judgements about whatever comes before it\u201d (AT X 359/CSM I\n9). The principal goal of philosophy is to cultivate one\u2019s\ncapacity for sound judgment, which Descartes identifies with\n\u201cgood sense\u201d (le bons sens) and \u201cuniversal\nwisdom.\u201d This goal should be pursued for its own sake, since\nother ends may distract us from the course of inquiry. Nevertheless,\nDescartes insists upon the practical benefits of the wisdom thereby\nachieved: one should consider \u201chow to increase the natural light\nof his reason\u2026 in order that his intellect should show his will\nwhat decision it ought to make in each of life\u2019s\ncontingencies\u201d (AT X 361/CSM I 10). In this way, we can expect\nto realize the \u201clegitimate fruits\u201d of the sciences:\n\u201cthe comforts of life\u201d and \u201cthe pleasure to be\ngained from contemplating the truth, which is practically the only\nhappiness in this life that is complete and untroubled by pain\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nThe last point previews one of the principal concerns of\nDescartes\u2019 ethics. In agreement with the ancients, he takes\nphilosophy\u2019s practical goal to be the realization of a happy\nlife: one in which we enjoy the best existence that a human being can\nhope to achieve. Descartes characterizes this life in terms of a type\nof mental contentment, or tranquility, that is experienced by the\nperson with a well-ordered mind. Here the influence of Stoic and\nEpicurean writers is evident (Cottingham 1998; Gueroult 1985; Pereboom\n1994; Rutherford 2014). In keeping with a central theme of Hellenistic\nethics, Descartes likens philosophy to a form of therapy that can\ntreat the mind\u2019s illnesses (those that stand in the way of its\nhappiness), just as medicine treats the illnesses of the body. As he\nwrites in one of his earliest recorded remarks, \u201cI use the term\n\u2018vice\u2019 to refer to the diseases of the mind, which are not\nso easy to recognize as diseases of the body. This is because we have\nfrequently experienced sound bodily health, but have never known true\nhealth of the mind\u201d (AT X 215/CSM I 3). Philosophy is thus\ncharged with leading us to \u201ctrue health of the mind,\u201d\nwhich it does through the cultivation of \u201ctrue and sound\njudgment.\u201d It is significant that Descartes\u2014again in\nagreement with the ancients\u2014focuses his efforts on the happiness\nthat can be realized within the natural life of a human being. He is\ncareful to note that it is a dogma of faith that \u201cthe supreme\nhappiness,\u201d consisting \u201csolely in the contemplation of the\ndivine majesty\u201d and attainable only through divine grace, is\nreserved for the \u201cnext life\u201d (AT VII 52/CSM II 36).\nHowever, in contrast to the position defended by Aquinas and Roman\nCatholic theology, the consideration of this \u201csupernatural\nbliss\u201d (b\u00e9atitude surnaturelle) plays no role in\nDescartes\u2019 system. On the contrary, he emphasizes that genuine\nhappiness is attainable within this life, in spite of the trials we\nface. \u201cOne of the main points of my own ethical code,\u201d he\ntells Mersenne, \u201cis to love life without fearing death\u201d\n(AT II 480\u20131/CSMK 131). The key to developing this affirmative\nattitude toward life is the cultivation of reason: \u201cTrue\nphilosophy\u2026 teaches that even amidst the saddest disasters and\nmost bitter pains we can always be content, provided that we know how\nto use our reason\u201d (AT IV 314/CSMK 272).\n\nDescartes\u2019 estimation of the importance of ethics is expressed\nmost clearly in the programmatic statement that prefaces the French\ntranslation of the Principles of Philosophy (1647). Here he\npresents his conception of philosophy in strikingly traditional terms:\n\u201cthe word \u2018philosophy\u2019 means the study of wisdom,\nand by \u2018wisdom\u2019 is meant not only prudence in our everyday\naffairs but also a perfect knowledge of all things that mankind is\ncapable of knowing, both for the conduct of life and for the\npreservation of health and the discovery of all manner of\nskills\u201d (AT IXB 2/CSM I 179). The key to the attainment of this\nwisdom, Descartes argues, is the recognition of the essential order\namong the different parts of our knowledge, an order he depicts in his\nimage of the \u201ctree of philosophy\u201d: \u201cThe roots are\nmetaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the\ntrunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three\nprincipal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals\u201d (AT IXB\n14/CSM I 186). Within this scheme, metaphysics is foundational, but\nthis knowledge and the knowledge of physics that is built upon it are\nsought for the sake of the practical benefits that follow from the\nsciences of medicine, mechanics and morals: \u201cjust as it is not\nthe roots or the trunk of a tree from which one gathers the fruit, but\nonly the ends of the branches, so the principal benefit of philosophy\ndepends on those parts of it which can only be learned last of\nall\u201d (AT IXB 15/CSM I 186). Foremost among these sciences is\nla morale: \u201cthe highest and most perfect moral system,\nwhich presupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences and is\nthe ultimate level of wisdom\u201d (ibid.). It is for the sake of\nthis science above all that Descartes hopes his readers will\n\u201crealize how important it is to continue the search for these\ntruths, and to what a high degree of wisdom, and to what perfection\nand felicity of life, these truths can bring us\u201d (AT IXB 20/CSM\nI 190).\n\nWhile it is clear that Descartes accords a privileged place to the\nscience he calls la morale, the fact remains that he left no\nsystematic presentation of his ethical views. He offers several\nexplanations for why he has not devoted more attention to ethics.\nGiven his conception of the order of knowledge, conclusions in ethics\nmust be established in a way that reveals their dependence on the\nprior conclusions of metaphysics and physics. Thus, the systematic\ninvestigation of ethics can begin only after certainty has been\nachieved in these prior theoretical disciplines. In a late letter to\nChanut, Descartes cites two further reasons for his silence on the\ntopic: \u201cIt is true that normally I refuse to write down my\nthoughts concerning morality. I have two reasons for this. One is that\nthere is no other subject in which malicious people can so readily\nfind pretexts for vilifying me; and the other is that I believe only\nsovereigns, or those authorized by them, have the right to concern\nthemselves with regulating the morals of other people\u201d (AT V\n86\u20137/CSMK 326). The first of these reasons reflects\nDescartes\u2019 inherent caution, reinforced by the hostile reception\nhis philosophy had received at the University of Utrecht (Gaukroger\n1995; Verbeek 1992). The second points to an important limitation in\nDescartes\u2019 conception of ethics: he does not enunciate a\nspecific set of obligations, because these, he believes, are the\npurview of the sovereign. This again may make it seem that Descartes\nrejects a substantial role for philosophy in ethics, and that he\noffers in its place a Hobbesian account of the authority of moral\ndictates grounded in a sovereign will. There is an element of truth in\nthis suggestion, but uncovering it requires drawing a crucial\ndistinction: if Descartes limits the role of philosophy in determining\nspecific moral rules, he nonetheless upholds the ancients\u2019\nconception of philosophy as the search for a wisdom sufficient for\nhappiness. It is in this sense that ethics remains central to\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy.\n2. The Provisional Moral Code of the Discourse\n\nThe best-known expression of Descartes\u2019 ethical views is the\n\u201cprovisional moral code\u201d (une morale par\nprovision) that appears in Part Three of Discourse on the\nMethod. Some have read this as a reliable statement of\nDescartes\u2019 considered position, but this is consistent neither\nwith the content of the Discourse itself nor with that of his\nlater writings. (For detailed discussions of the \u201cprovisional\nmorality,\u201d see Carraud 1997; Cimakasky and Polansky 2012;\nMarshall 1998, 2003.)\n\nDescartes frames the rules of his provisional morality as part of the\nepistemological project\u2014the search for certainty\u2014announced\nin Part Two of the Discourse. In order that he may act\ndecisively and live as happily as possible while avoiding\n\u201cprecipitate conclusions and assumptions,\u201d Descartes\nproposes \u201ca provisional moral code consisting of just three or\nfour maxims\u201d:\n\nThe first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, holding\nconstantly to the religion in which by God\u2019s grace I had been\ninstructed from my childhood\u2026. The second maxim was to be as\nfirm and decisive in my actions as I could, and to follow even the\nmost doubtful opinions, once I had adopted them, with no less\nconstancy than if they had been quite certain\u2026. My third maxim\nwas to try always to master myself rather than fortune, and to change\nmy desires rather than the order of the world\u2026. Finally, to\nconclude this moral code\u2026 I thought I could do no better than\nto continue with the [occupation] I was engaged in, and to devote my\nwhole life to cultivating my reason and advancing as far as I could in\nthe knowledge of the truth, following the method I had prescribed for\nmyself (AT VI 22\u20137/CSM I 122\u20134).\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 apparent uncertainty about the number of rules in his\nprovisional code (\u201cthree or four\u201d) is noteworthy and may\nbe explained by the different status he assigns to the rules. While\nthe first three prescribe how to act in the absence of any certain\nknowledge of good and evil (including the much-criticized deference to\nthe laws and customs of his country), the fourth rule holds out the\npossibility of cultivating his reason so as to arrive at knowledge of\nthe truth. Echoing his remarks in the Rules, he says that in\nthe discovery of such truths he has experienced \u201csuch extreme\ncontentment that I did not think one could enjoy any sweeter or purer\none in this life\u201d (AT VI 27/CSM I 124). This might be read as\nlimiting our happiness to the contemplation of intellectual truths of\nthe sort announced in Part Four of the Discourse; however,\nDescartes makes it clear that he sees the search for truth as having a\npractical import as well. By following the method he has prescribed\nfor himself and exercising his capacity for judgment, he is confident\nof acquiring all the true knowledge of which he is capable, and\n\u201cin this way all the true goods within my reach\u201d (AT VI\n28/CSM I 125).\n\nIt is evident, then, that the first three maxims of the\n\u201cprovisional moral code\u201d are just that\u2014provisional\nrules that Descartes will follow while he carries out his search for\ncertain knowledge\u2014and that he is confident that this search will\nterminate in knowledge of \u201ctrue goods\u201d that will supply\nreliable directives for action. Descartes hints at the range of these\ngoods in Part Five of the Discourse. They include the\nmaintenance of health, \u201cwhich is undoubtedly the first good\n[le premier bien] and the foundation of all the other goods\nin this life.\u201d Because \u201cthe mind depends so much on the\ntemperament and disposition of the bodily organs,\u201d Descartes\nadds, we must look to medicine if we are \u201cto find some means of\nmaking men in general wiser and more skilful than they have been up\ntill now\u201d (AT VI 62/CSM I 143). The extent of Descartes\u2019\ncommitment to the integration of physical and psychological health\nwill become apparent in the Passions of the Soul. It would be\na mistake, however, to conclude from this that he proposes a reduction\nof ethics to medicine. As presented already in the Discourse,\nhis ethics is founded on an ideal of virtue as a perfected power of\njudgment, together with the assumption that virtue by itself is\nsufficient for happiness:\n\n[S]ince our will tends to pursue or avoid only what our intellect\nrepresents as good or bad, we need only to judge well in order to act\nwell, and to judge as well as we can in order to do our\nbest\u2014that is to say, in order to acquire all the virtues and in\ngeneral all the other goods we can acquire. And when we are certain of\nthis, we cannot fail to be happy. (AT VI 28/CSM I 125)\n\n\nAnticipated in this passage are the core ideas of Descartes\u2019\nethics: the notion of virtue, as a disposition of the will to\njudge in accordance with reason\u2019s representations of the good,\nand the notion of happiness, as a state of mental well-being\nthat is achieved through the practice of virtue. In his correspondence\nwith Princess Elisabeth, Descartes will elaborate on the relationship\nbetween these two ideas. Here is it worth noting that while it is\nvirtue that links ethics to the broader goal of the cultivation of\nreason, Descartes gives no less weight to the importance of happiness,\nin the form of tranquility. This is made clear near the end of the\nDiscourse, when he explains why, in spite of his\nreservations, he has published the book under his own name: \u201cI\nam not excessively fond of glory\u2014indeed if I dare to say so, I\ndislike it in so far as I regard it as opposed to that tranquility\nwhich I value above everything else\u2026. [I]f I had done this [sc.\nconcealed his identity] I thought I would do myself an injustice, and\nmoreover that would have given me a certain sort of disquiet, which\nagain would have been opposed to the perfect peace of mind I am\nseeking\u201d (AT VI 74/CSM I 149).\n3. The Meditations and the Ethics of Belief\n\nThe Meditations is distinguished from Descartes\u2019 other\nworks in explicitly foreswearing practical concerns. The conceit of\nthe Meditations is a thinker who has abstracted himself from\nany connection to the external world. For this reason, Descartes feels\nconfident in pursuing the method of hyperbolic doubt, which rejects as\nfalse any opinion concerning which the slightest doubt can be raised:\n\u201cI know that no danger or error will result from my plan, and\nthat I cannot possibly go too far in my distrustful attitude. This is\nbecause the task now in hand does not involve action but merely the\nacquisition of knowledge\u201d (AT VII 22/CSM II 15).\n\nOn these grounds, one might feel justified in setting aside the\nMeditations in an examination of Descartes\u2019 ethics. In\nfact, though, the Meditations pursues, in a theoretical\ncontext, an inquiry that is closely related to ethics: the proper\ndisposition of the will. (For readings of the Meditations as\nsupporting the development of virtue, see Naaman-Zauderer 2010;\nShapiro 2005, 2013.)\n\nDescartes takes the operation of the will to be integral to both\nbelief and action. In general, the will, or \u201cfreedom of\nchoice,\u201d consists \u201cin our ability to do or not do\nsomething (that is, to affirm or deny, to pursue or avoid); or rather,\nit consists simply in the fact that when the intellect puts something\nforward for affirmation or denial or for pursuit or avoidance, our\ninclinations are such that we do not feel we are determined by any\nexternal force\u201d (AT VII 57/CSM II 40). For Descartes, freedom is\nan essential property of the will; however, this freedom does not\nentail indifference: \u201cif I always saw clearly what was true and\ngood, I should never have to deliberate about the right judgement or\nchoice; in that case, although I should be wholly free, it would be\nimpossible for me ever to be in a state of indifference\u201d (AT VII\n58/CSM II 40). We are indifferent only when our perception of the\ntrue, or of the good, is less than clear and distinct.\n\nDescartes assigns the will a pivotal role in the pursuit of knowledge.\nWhen presented with a clear and distinct perception of what is true,\nthe will is compelled to assent to it. When the perception is less\nthan fully clear and distinct, the will is not compelled in the same\nway. In such cases, it has the power either to assent or to withhold\nassent. Given this, the correct use of free will is identified as the\ncritical factor in the attainment of knowledge: \u201cIf\u2026 I\nsimply refrain from making a judgment in cases where I do not perceive\nthe truth with sufficient clarity and distinctness, then it is clear\nthat I am behaving correctly and avoiding error. But if in such cases,\nI either affirm or deny, then I not using my free will\ncorrectly\u201d (AT VII 59\u201360/CSM II 41). Provided we refrain\nfrom assenting to what is not clearly and distinctly perceived, our\njudgments are guaranteed to be true.\n\nIn the Fourth Meditation, Descartes draws a close parallel between the\nwill\u2019s relation to the true and to the good. Just as the will is\ncompelled to assent to what is clearly and distinctly perceived to be\ntrue, so it is compelled to choose what is clearly and distinctly\nperceived to be good: \u201cif I always saw clearly what was true and\ngood, I should never have to deliberate about the right judgement or\nchoice\u201d (AT VII 58/CSM II 40). And analogously, we might\nsuppose, just as the recipe for avoiding error is to withhold assent\nfrom that whose truth is not perceived clearly and distinctly, so the\nrecipe for avoiding moral error, or sin, is to refuse to choose that\nwhose goodness is not perceived clearly and distinctly. In his\nobjections to the Meditations, Arnauld cautioned Descartes on\nthis point, suggesting that the comments he makes \u201con the cause\nof error would give rise to the most serious objections if they were\nstretched out of context to cover the pursuit of good and evil\u201d\n(AT VII 215/CSM II 151). Heeding Arnauld\u2019s warning, Descartes\nadded a disclaimer to the Synopsis of the Meditations:\n\u201cBut here it should be noted in passing that I do not deal at\nall with sin, i.e. the error which is committed in pursuing good and\nevil, but only with the error that occurs in distinguishing truth and\nfalsehood\u201d (AT VII 15/CSM II 11). This assertion flatly\ncontradicts the text of the Fourth Meditation, where Descartes had\nwritten that, where the will is indifferent, \u201cit easily turns\naside from what is true and good, and this is the source of my error\nand sin\u201d (AT VII 58/CSM II 40\u20131). In light of this, and\nDescartes\u2019 insistence to Mersenne that the disclaimer be placed\nin parentheses to indicate that it had been added, there is reason to\nsee Descartes as upholding the same account of the will in relation to\nthe true and the good.\n\nThere is nonetheless one important way in which the operation of the\nwill in a purely theoretical context (such as the\nMeditations) must be distinguished from its operation in\npractical contexts. In the pursuit of certainty, Descartes claims that\nit is both possible and reasonable to withhold assent from any idea\nthat is not perceived clearly and distinctly. Outside the isolated\nconfines of the Meditations, however, it is impossible to\nmaintain such an attitude of detachment. Life demands that we act, by\nchoosing among competing goods on the basis of ideas that are often\nless than clear and distinct. When faced with the exigencies of\nexistence, suspension of choice is not an option. Since we are forced\nto act under conditions of uncertainty, it might seem to follow that\nwe are condemned to a life of moral error, constantly making wrong\nchoices on the basis of inadequate perceptions of the goodness and\nbadness of objects. This may be the ordinary lot of human beings;\nhowever, Descartes does not believe that this condition is\nirremediable. In his later writings he presents an account of virtue\nthat shows how we can improve our ability to make right choices, or to\nact virtuously, despite the inadequacy of much of our knowledge.\n4. Virtue and Happiness: The Correspondence with Princess Elisabeth\n\nDescartes\u2019 correspondence with Princess Elisabeth has as its\ncentral topic the relation of mind and body\u2014a relation that is\nexplored from the point of view of both theory (the problem of\nmind-body union) and practice (see Shapiro 2007 for a full account of\nthe correspondence). With regard to practice, Descartes is again\nconcerned with the connection between physical and mental well-being,\nand in particular the deleterious effects of passions such as sadness,\ngrief, fear and melancholy. He discusses these topics in the course of\nadvising Elisabeth on how to cope with her own illness and distress.\nThe question, however, is an ancient one: when faced with the\nhardships of life\u2014physical illness, loss, anxiety\u2014how can\none respond in a way that allows one to preserve the tranquility that\nis the core of our happiness?\n\nDescartes\u2019 abiding interest in medicine is prominent here, since\nthe treatment of physical illness is an effective way of removing one\nof main sources of mental disturbance. Yet he is well aware of the\nlimits of medical knowledge, and so he acknowledges that the passions\nalso must be confronted directly: \u201cThey are domestic enemies\nwith whom we are forced to keep company, and we have to be perpetually\non guard lest they injure us\u201d (AT IV 218/CSMK 249). Descartes\nprescribes to Elisabeth a two-part remedy for protecting herself\nagainst the harmful effects of the passions: \u201cso far as possible\nto distract our imagination and senses from them, and when obliged by\nprudence to consider them, to do so with our intellect alone\u201d\n(ibid.). The first part of the remedy relies on our ability to direct\nthe imagination away from the immediate objects of the passions. Given\nthis power, Descartes argues, \u201cthere might be a person who had\ncountless genuine reasons for distress but who took such pains to\ndirect his imagination that he never thought of them except when\ncompelled by some practical nececessity, and who spent the rest of his\ntime in the consideration of objects which could furnish contentment\nand joy\u201d (AT IV 219/CSMK 250). Descartes speculates that this\nkind of cognitive therapy by itself might be sufficient to restore the\npatient to health. In circumventing the causal pathway by which the\npassion arises, the body will be returned to a healthy state.\nDescartes offers his own history as an example of this phenomenon:\n\u201cFrom [my mother] I inherited a dry cough and a pale colour\nwhich stayed with me until I was more than twenty, so that all the\ndoctors who saw me up to that time gave it as their verdict that I\nwould die young. But I have always had an inclination to look at\nthings from the most favorable angle and to make my principal\nhappiness depend upon myself alone, and I believe that this\ninclination caused the indisposition, which was almost part of my\nnature, gradually to disappear completely\u201d (AT IV 221/CSMK 251).\nThis line of thought leads directly to the Passions of the\nSoul, in which Descartes discusses at length the causation and\nfunction of the passions.\n\nThe second part of the remedy prescribed to Elisabeth aligns\nDescartes\u2019 position with that of the ancients, who stress the\nrole of reason in regulating the passions. The person who is led by\npassion will inevitably experience sadness, grief, fear,\nanxiety\u2014emotions inconsistent with \u201cperfect\nhappiness.\u201d Such happiness is the possession alone of those\nelevated souls in which reason \u201calways remains\nmistress\u201d:\n\nthe difference between the greatest souls and those that are base and\ncommon consists principally in the fact that common souls abandon\nthemselves to their passions and are happy or unhappy only according\nas the things that happen to them are agreeable or unpleasant; the\ngreatest souls, on the other hand, reason in a way that is so strong\nand cogent that, although they also have passions, and indeed passions\nwhich are often more violent than those of ordinary people, their\nreason nevertheless always remains mistress, and even makes their\nafflictions serve them and contribute to the perfect happiness they\nenjoy in this life. (AT IV 202; translation from Gaukroger 2002, 236).\n\n\nThe link between reason and happiness is explored at length by\nDescartes in letters exchanged with Elisabeth during the summer and\nfall of 1645. The discussion begins with Descartes\u2019 suggestion\nthat they examine what the ancients had to say on the topic, and he\nchooses as exemplary Seneca\u2019s work \u201cOn the Happy\nLife\u201d (De Vita Beata). Descartes, however, quickly\nbecomes dissatisfied with Seneca\u2019s treatment and proposes\ninstead to explain to Elizabeth how he thinks the subject\n\u201cshould have been treated by such a philosopher, unenlightened\nby faith, with only natural reason to guide him\u201d (AT IV 263/CSMK\n257).\n\nBasic to Descartes\u2019 account is the distinction he draws between\n(i) the supreme good, (ii) happiness, and (iii) the final end or goal,\nnotions generally taken as equivalent in ancient eudaimonism (AT IV\n275/CSMK 261). Descartes identifies the supreme good with virtue,\nwhich he defines as \u201ca firm and constant will to bring about\neverything we judge to be the best and to employ all the force of our\nintellect in judging well\u201d (AT IV 277/CSMK 262). Virtue is the\nsupreme good, he argues, because it is \u201cthe only good, among all\nthose we can possess, which depends entirely on our free will\u201d\n(AT IV 276/CSMK 261), and because it is sufficient for happiness.\nDescartes explains happiness (la b\u00e9atitude) in\npsychological terms. It is the \u201cperfect contentment of mind and\ninner satisfaction\u2026 which is acquired by the wise without\nfortune\u2019s favor\u201d (AT IV 264/CSMK 257). According to\nDescartes, \u201cwe cannot ever practice any virtue\u2014that is to\nsay, do what our reason tells us we should do\u2014without receiving\nsatisfaction and pleasure from doing so\u201d (AT IV 284/CSMK 263).\nThus, happiness is a natural product of virtue and can be enjoyed\nregardless of what fortune brings. The dependence of happiness on\nvirtue is confirmed by Descartes\u2019 account of the final end,\nwhich, he says, can be regarded either as happiness or as the supreme\ngood: virtue is the target at which we ought to aim, but happiness is\nthe prize that induces us to fire at it (AT IV 277/CMSK 262).\n\nAnalysis of the fine structure of Descartes\u2019 ethical theory and\nits relation to ancient eudaimonist theories has emerged as an active\narea of research in recent years. Among the issues debated are the\ncontent of Descartes\u2019 notion of virtue, the identity of virtue\nand a human being\u2019s highest good, and the sufficiency of virtue\nfor happiness. While defending different answers to these questions,\nscholars have broadly agreed in seeing Descartes as advancing an\noriginal ethical theory that critically engages the positions of\nAristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics. (For competing readings, some of\nwhich diverge from the account presented here, see Alanen 2009;\nGueroult 1985; Naaman-Zauderer 2010; Rutherford 2004, 2014; Santilli\n1992; Shapiro 2008, 2011; Svensson 2010, 2011, 2015, 2019a, 2019b,\n2020; Viljanen 2021; Wienand 2012; Youpa 2013.)\n\nAs Descartes defines it, virtue depends upon the employment of reason.\nThough it is conceivable that one might have a \u201cfirm and\nconstant will\u201d to do something without having examined whether\nit is the right thing to do, one cannot have a firm and constant will\nto do what is judged to be the best, unless one is capable of judging\nwhat the best is. Thus, virtue presupposes knowledge of the relative\ngoodness of objects of choice, and this knowledge Descartes assigns to\nreason: \u201cThe true function of reason\u2026 is to examine and\nconsider without passion the value of all the perfections, both of the\nbody and of the soul, which can be acquired by our conduct, so\nthat\u2026 we shall always choose the better\u201d (AT IV\n286\u20137/CSMK 265).\n\nBut how exactly does reason allow us to discriminate between lesser\nand greater goods? On one point Descartes\u2019 position is clear:\nthe claim of virtue to be the supreme good follows from the fact that\nit is nothing more than the correct use of our free will, employing it\nto choose whatever reason represents as the greatest good. As\nDescartes argues in the Fourth Meditation, we are in no way more like\nGod\u2014that is, more perfect\u2014than in our possession of free\nwill. Hence the correct use of this will is our greatest good:\n\u201cfree will is in itself the noblest thing we can have, since it\nmakes us in a way equal to God and seems to exempt us from being his\nsubjects; and so its correct use is the greatest of all the goods we\npossess\u201d (AT V 85/CSMK 326). Reason shows that the greatest good\nwithin our power is the perfection of the will. In any choice we make,\nthe value of the particular goods we pursue will always be less than\nthat of the will itself; hence, provided we act virtuously, we can be\ncontent, whether or not we succeed in obtaining whatever other goods\nwe seek.\n\nYet this still leaves open the question of how to assess the value of\nthese other goods. The supreme good, virtue, consists in a firm\nresolution to bring about whatever reason judges to be the best. But\non the basis of what does reason make this determination? What\nknowledge allows reason to form a well-founded judgment about the\ngoodness and badness of objects, in the pursuit of which we act\nvirtuously? Descartes criticizes Seneca on just this point\u2014that\nhe fails to teach us \u201call the principal truths whose knowledge\nis necessary to facilitate the practice of virtue and to regulate our\ndesires and passions, and thus to enjoy natural happiness\u201d (AT\nIV 267/CSMK 258). In response, Elisabeth worries that Descartes\u2019\naccount, which promises the attainment of happiness, might presuppose\nmore knowledge than we can possibly possess. In assuaging her concern,\nDescartes summarizes the knowledge he believes we can rely on in\ndirecting the will toward virtuous ends. It consists of a surprisingly\nsmall set of \u201cthe truths most useful to us.\u201d The first two\nare basic principles of Cartesian metaphysics as presented in the\nMeditations:\n\nThe existence of an omnipotent, supremely perfect God, whose\ndecrees are infallible. \u201cThis teaches us to accept calmly all\nthe things which happen to us as expressly sent by God\u201d (AT IV\n291\u20132/CSMK 265).\nThe immortality of the soul and its independence from the body.\n\u201cThis prevents us from fearing death, and so detaches our\naffections from the things of this world that we look upon whatever is\nin the power of fortune with nothing but scorn\u201d (AT IV 292/CSMK\n266).\n\n\nThe next three truths derive from Cartesian natural philosophy,\nbroadly understood:\n\nThe indefinite extent of the universe. In recognizing this we\novercome our inclination to place ourselves at the center of the\ncosmos, as though everything ought to happen for our sake, which is\nthe source of \u201ccountless vain anxieties and troubles\u201d (AT\nIV 292/CSMK 266).\nThat we are part of a larger community of beings, whose interest\ntake precedence over our own. \u201cThough each of us is a person\ndistinct from others, whose interests are accordingly in some way\ndifferent from those of the rest of the world, we ought still to think\nthat none of us could subsist alone and that each one of us is really\none of the many parts of the universe\u2026. And the interests of\nthe whole, of which each of us is a part, must always be preferred to\nthose of our particular person\u201d (AT IV 293/CSMK 266).\nThat our passions represent goods as being much greater than they\nreally are, and that the pleasures of the body are never as lasting as\nthose of the soul or so great in possession as they are in\nanticipation. \u201cWe must pay careful attention to this, so that\nwhen we feel ourselves moved by some passion we suspend our judgment\nuntil it is calmed, and do not let ourselves be deceived by the false\nappearances of the goods of this world\u201d (AT IV 295/CSMK\n267).\n\n\nThe final proposition is of a quite different character:\n\nWhenever we lack certain knowledge of how to act, we should defer\nto the laws and customs of the land. \u201c[O]ne must also minutely\nexamine all the customs of one\u2019s place of abode to see how far\nthey should be followed. Though we cannot have certain demonstrations\nof everything, still we must take sides, and in matters of custom\nembrace the opinions that seem the most probable, so they we may never\nbe irresolute when we need to act. For nothing causes regret and\nremorse except irresolution\u201d (ibid.).\n\n\nThe truths that Descartes takes to be \u201cmost useful to us\u201d\ndo not consist of discoveries original to his philosophy. Rather, they\nreflect a general outlook on the world that could be embraced by\nsomeone without Cartesian sympathies: the existence of an omnipotent\nand supremely perfect God; the immortality of the soul; the vastness\nof the universe; that we have duties to a larger whole of which we are\na part; that our passions often distort the goodness of their objects.\nWhat Descartes can claim at most (and what he does claim in the\npreface to the Principles of Philosophy) is that he has\nsupplied better reasons for believing these propositions to be true;\nhe has established certain knowledge where before there was only\nunstable belief.\n\nThe establishment of a body of knowledge relevant to the practice of\nvirtue supplies the basis for a new set of moral rules that replaces\nthe provisional morality of the Discourse. Descartes presents\nthem to Elisabeth as a succinct recipe for happiness:\n\nIt seems to me that each person can make himself content by himself\nwithout any external assistance, provided he respects three\nconditions, which are related to the three rules of provisional\nmorality which I put forward in the Discourse on the Method.\nThe first is that he should always try to employ his mind as well as\nhe can to discover what he should and should not do in all the\ncircumstances of life. The second is that he should have a firm and\nconstant resolution to carry out whatever reason recommends without\nbeing diverted by his passions or appetites\u2026. The third is that\nhe should bear in mind that while he thus guides himself as far as he\ncan by reason, all the good things which he does not possess are one\nand all entirely outside his power. (AT IV 265/CSMK 257\u20138)\n\n\nHere the Discourse\u2019s final provisional rule has become\nthe first rule, reflecting the assumption that reason, in the form of\njudgments about good and evil, can serve as a reliable guide for\naction. Similarly, the Discourse\u2019s second rule, which\nprescribed that one be \u201cas firm and decisive in [one\u2019s]\nactions\u201d as one can, and \u201cfollow even the most doubtful\nopinions\u201d once adopted, has now become an injunction to carry\nout whatever reason recommends without being diverted by the passions.\nThe two sets of rules overlap most closely in the third rule, which\ncounsels us to recognize the limits of our power and to curtail our\ndesires for things outside of it. In this case too, however, the rule\nnow has a different status for Descartes, since it is supported by\ncertain knowledge of God, on whom all things depend, and the\nimmortality of the soul.\n\nThe truths that Descartes presents to Elisabeth supply a body of\nrational knowledge on the basis of which we are able to use our free\nwill correctly, choosing good over evil. Clearly, though, the guidance\noffered by these truths is of the most general sort. They do not\nunderwrite specific directives for action or dictate what we ought to\ndo in any particular circumstance. Instead, they are best seen simply\nas facilitating right action, by removing impediments to it (anxiety\nabout the future, fear of death) or saving us from obvious errors\n(ignoring the concerns of others, giving priority to bodily goods).\nThat the content of morality is underdetermined by the knowledge on\nwhich it depends is made clear by Descartes\u2019 final proposition,\nwhich instructs us to defer to the laws and customs of the land when\nit is not obvious how we ought to act. This proposition echoes the\nfirst rule of provisional morality that Descartes prescribes for\nhimself in the Discourse. However, this rule, too, has\nundergone an important transformation. Whereas in the\nDiscourse deference to the laws and customs of one\u2019s\ncountry is presented as the first rule of provisional morality, to\nElisabeth it is offered as a fallback position, acknowledging that\nwhile we do indeed possess certain knowledge of good and evil, there\nare limits to this knowledge.\n\nThe recognition of these limits is an enduring feature of\nDescartes\u2019 ethics. The truths outlined to Elizabeth lay down a\nset of general guidelines for how to use the will correctly. Following\nthem, however, does not guarantee that we infallibly choose the\ngreatest good; nor is success of this sort required for virtue. As far\nas virtue is concerned, the critical point is that we do whatever we\ncan to ascertain the best course of action, appealing if necessary to\ncivil law or custom, and that we then will decisively. (For more on\nthis point, see Rutherford 2014.)\n\nThis creates an important disanalogy for Descartes between the\ntheoretical and the practical. In both cases, we have a responsibility\nto correct our understanding before committing the will in judgment.\nOnly in the theoretical realm, however, is it reasonable to suspend\nassent indefinitely if we lack the knowledge needed to be confident of\nthe correctness of our decision. In the case of action, Descartes\ndenies that this is appropriate: \u201cAs far as the conduct of life\nis concerned, I am very far from thinking that we should assent only\nto what is clearly perceived. On the contrary, I do not think that we\nshould always wait even for probable truths\u201d (AT VII 149/CSM II\n106). In acting, the essential thing is that we will in the right\nmanner, allowing reason to guide our choice so far as it can.\n\u201cIt is\u2026 not necessary that our reason should be free from\nerror,\u201d he tells Elisabeth; \u201cit is sufficient if our\nconscience testifies that we have never lacked resolution and virtue\nto carry out whatever we have judged the best course\u201d (AT IV\n266/CSMK 258). Resolution, or firmness of judgment, is crucial, for it\nis the lack of this, above all, that causes \u201cregret and\nremorse\u201d and thereby threatens our happiness (AT IV 264/CSMK\n257).\n5. Generosity and The Passions of the Soul\n\nDescartes\u2019 correspondence with Princess Elisabeth led directly\nto the composition of his final book, The Passions of the\nSoul, a large part of which was written during the winter of\n1645\u20136. In a prefatory letter to the book, Descartes maintains\nthat in it he has set out to explain the passions \u201conly as a\nnatural philosopher [physicien], and not as a rhetorician or\neven as a moral philosopher\u201d (AT XI 326/CSM I 327). On the face\nof it, this seems to be contradicted by the contents of the book,\nsince much of it is devoted to understanding the passions from an\nethical point of view\u2014that is, understanding how they can be\naccommodated to the goal of happiness. The significance of\nDescartes\u2019 remark lies in the particular account he gives of the\npassions. In general, they are defined as \u201cthose perceptions,\nsensations or emotions of the soul which we refer particularly to it,\nand which are caused, maintained and strengthened by some movement of\nthe [animal] spirits\u201d (art. 27; CSM I 338\u20139).\nDescartes\u2019 central thesis is that the passions originate in\nbodily changes, which are communicated by the animal spirits to the\npineal gland, and thereby give rise to affective states in the\nsoul\u2014affections which are referred to the soul itself and not to\nthe body. Because the passions originate in the body, a large part of\nthe book is devoted to differentiating the passions and accounting for\ntheir effects in physiological terms; hence Descartes\u2019 claim to\nexplain them as a natural philosopher. (For extended treatments of\nDescartes\u2019 theory of the passions, see Brown 2006; James 1997;\nKambouchner 1995a, b.)\n\nDescartes distinguishes six primitive passions: wonder, love, hatred,\ndesire, joy and sadness. All the rest are either composed from these\nor species of them (art. 69). The passions operate in a common manner:\n\u201cthe principal effect of all the human passions is that they\nmove and dispose the soul to want the things for which they prepare\nthe body.\u201d Thus, the passsions are in the first place\nmotivational states that dispose the soul to will specific actions:\n\u201cthe feeling of fear moves the soul to want to flee, that of\ncourage to want to fight, and similarly with the others\u201d (art.\n40; CSM I 343). Different passions result from the effects of\ndifferent motions on the pineal gland; and these, Descartes assumes,\nhave been ordained by God for the sake of preserving the human body:\n\u201cThe function of all the passions consists solely in this, that\nthey dispose our soul to want the things which nature deems useful for\nus, and to persist in this volition; and the same agitation of the\nspirits which normally causes the passions also disposes the body to\nmake movements which help to attain these things\u201d (art. 52; CSM\nI 349). (Exactly how to characterize the passions as mental states\nremains controversial. In addition to the works already cited, see\nBrassfield 2012; Greenberg 2009; Hoffman 1991; Kisner 2018; Schmitter\n2008.)\n\nGiven their natural function of preserving the body, the passions are\nall by nature good (art. 211). They spur us to act in ways that are in\ngeneral conducive to our well-being. However, the effects of the\npassions are not uniformly beneficial. Because they exaggerate the\ngoodness or badness of their objects, they can lead us to pursue\napparent goods or flee apparent harms too quickly. The passions are\nalso ordered for the sake of the preservation of the body, and not the\ncontentment of the soul; and because they originate in the body, any\nmalfunction of the latter can disrupt the normal operation of the\npassions. For these reasons, it is necessary that the passions be\nregulated by reason, whose \u201cproper weapons\u201d against their\nmisuse and excess are \u201cfirm and determinate judgements bearing\nupon the knowledge of good and evil, which the soul has resolved to\nfollow in guiding its conduct\u201d (art. 48; CSM I 347). Summarizing\nhis position at the end of the Passions, Descartes says that\n\u201cthe chief use of wisdom lies in its teaching us to be masters\nof our passions and to control them with such skill that the evils\nwhich they cause are quite bearable, and even become a source of\njoy\u201d (art. 212; CSM I 404).\n\nOver and above the role they play in the preservation of the body, the\npassions also make a direct contribution to human happiness. In the\nconcluding article of the Passions, Descartes goes so far as\nto say that \u201cit is on the passions alone that all the good and\nevil of this life depends\u201d (art. 212; CSM I 404). In the body of\nthe article, he qualifies this claim, allowing that \u201cthe soul\ncan have pleasures of its own. But the pleasures common to it and the\nbody depend entirely on the passions.\u201d His considered view on\nthis question seems to be that the passions (particularly love and\njoy) form a valuable part of a human life, that the enjoyment of them\nis consistent with the happiness that is the natural product of\nvirtue, but that happiness of the latter sort can be had even in the\npresence of harmful passions such as sadness or grief.\n\nHappiness, as Descartes defines it for Elisabeth, is a \u201cperfect\ncontentment of mind and inner satisfaction\u201d (AT IV 264/CSMK\n257), or the \u201csatisfaction and pleasure\u201d that accompanies\nthe practice of virtue (AT IV 284/CSMK 263). In the Passions,\nhe distinguishes these affects from the passions that originate in the\nbody. The former are described as \u201cinternal emotions of the\nsoul,\u201d which are \u201cproduced in the soul only by the soul\nitself. In this they differ from its passions, which always depend on\nsome movement of the [animal] spirits\u201d (art. 147; CSM I 381).\n\u201cInternal emotions\u201d are thus independent of the body and\nthe basis of a happiness that can withstand \u201cthe most violent\nassaults of the passions\u201d:\n\ninternal emotions affect us more intimately, and consequently have\nmuch more power over us than the passions which occur with them but\nare distinct from them. To this extent it is certain that, provided\nour soul always has the means of happiness within itself, all the\ntroubles coming from elsewhere are powerless to harm it. Such troubles\nwill serve rather to increase its joy; for on seeing that it cannot be\nharmed by them, it becomes aware of its perfection. And in order that\nour soul should have the means of happiness, it needs only to follow\nvirtue strictly [de suivre exactement la vertu]. For if\nanyone lives in such a way that his conscience cannot reproach him for\never failing to do something he judges to be the best (which is what I\nhere call \u2018following virtue\u2019), he will receive from this a\nsatisfaction which has such power to make him happy that the most\nviolent assaults of the passions will never have sufficient power to\ndisturb the tranquillity of his soul. (art. 148; AT XI 441\u20132/CSM\nI 381\u20132)\n\n\nDescartes is committed to the view that virtue is sufficient for\nhappiness, that is, a \u201cperfect contentment of mind and inner\nsatisfaction.\u201d At the same time, he denies that virtue has value\nonly as a means to happiness. On the contrary, virtue is grounded in\nthe one aspect of human nature that is of unconditional value: the\nexercise of our free will, the perfection of the soul that\n\u201crenders us in a certain way like God by making us masters of\nourselves\u201d (art. 152; CSM I 384).\n\nThe full flowering of virtue is found in the moral ideal Descartes\ncalls \u201cgenerosity\u201d\n(g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9), which he describes as\n\u201cthe key to all the other virtues\u201d (art. 161; CSM I 388).\nGenerosity begins as a passion, prompted by thoughts of the nature of\nfree will and the many advantages that follow from its correct use and\nthe many cares that follow from its misuse. Repetition of these\nthoughts and of the consequent passion produces the virtue of\ngenerosity, which is a \u201chabit\u201d of the soul (art. 161; CSM\nI 387). This habit, \u201ctrue generosity,\u201d has two components,\none intellectual, the other volitional: \u201cThe first consists in\n[a person\u2019s] knowing that nothing truly belongs to him but this\nfreedom to dispose his volitions, and that he ought to be praised or\nblamed for no other reason than his using this freedom well or badly.\nThe second consists in his feeling within himself a firm and constant\nresolution to use it well\u2014that is, never to lack the will to\nundertake and carry out whatever he judges to be best. To do that is\nto follow virtue perfectly\u201d (art. 153; AT XI 445\u20146/ CSM I\n384). (For further discussion, see Normore 2019; Parvizian 2016;\nRodis-Lewis 1987; Shapiro 1999, 2005.)\n\nGenerosity is an ideal of individual ethical perfection, but Descartes\nalso draws from it an important conclusion concerning our relations to\nothers (Brown 2006; Frierson 2002). Upon recognizing an element of\nunconditional value within himself, the generous person is naturally\nled to extend this recognition to others: \u201cThose who possess\nthis knowledge and this feeling about themselves readily come to\nbelieve that any other person can have the same knowledge and feeling\nabout himself, because this involves nothing which depends on someone\nelse.\u201d Those who are endowed with generosity are thus disposed\nto overlook conventional distinctions of class and social status, and\nto focus on the true, intrinsic worth of each individual:\n\nJust as they do not consider themselves much inferior to those who\nhave greater wealth or honour, or even to those who have more\nintelligence, knowledge or beauty, or generally to those who surpass\nthem in some other perfections, equally they do not have much more\nesteem for themselves than for those whom they surpass. For all these\nthings seem to them to be unimportant, by contrast with the virtuous\nwill for which alone they esteem themselves, and which they suppose\nalso to be present, or at least capable of being present, in every\nother person. (art. 154; CSM I 384).\n\n\nThus, despite its nod to law and custom, which fill the space opened\nby the limits of our moral knowledge, Descartes\u2019 ethics is\ncrowned by a principle of moral universalism. In virtue of their free\nwill, all human beings have the same moral status and deserve equal\nmoral respect. In this we find an important anticipation of\nKant\u2019s ethics, which emerges from a similar consideration of the\nunconditional value of a rational and free will.\n",
