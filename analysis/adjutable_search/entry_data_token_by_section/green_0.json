    "main_text": "Green\u2019s Life, Works, and Influence\n1. Green\u2019s Life, Works, and Influence\n\nGreen was born in Birkin, Yorkshire, April 7, 1836. His mother died\nwhen he was very young, and he was educated by his father, Valentine\nGreen, until he attended Rugby School in 1850. Green entered Balliol\nCollege, Oxford University, in 1855, where he was taught by Benjamin\nJowett and Charles Parker. Under Jowett\u2019s mentorship, Green was\nintroduced to both classical Greek and eighteenth and nineteenth\ncentury German philosophy and earned a First in Greats.\n\nGreen remained at Oxford after receiving his degree. He was appointed\nas a Lecturer in Ancient and Modern History at Balliol in 1860 and was\nelected Whyte\u2019s Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford in 1877,\na position he held until his death in 1882. Green was among those\nresponsible for reforming the philosophical curriculum to include\nmodern as well as ancient sources. His influence on undergraduates was\nconsiderable\u2014inspiring many students by his intellectual, moral,\nand spiritual seriousness.\n\nGreen became active in Liberal Party politics in the mid-1860s. In\n1876 he was elected to the Oxford town council; he was the first don\nto serve as a representative of the citizens rather than the\nUniversity of Oxford. His principal policy reforms concerned land\nreform, labor regulation, education, and temperance. He supported the\nIrish Land Act of 1881, which sought to secure property rights of\npeasant farmers in Ireland. In education, he argued that primary\neducation should be compulsory and state-financed. He served as an\nassistant commissioner on the Taunton Commission on Secondary\nEducation in 1865\u201366, arguing for significant reforms in\neducation to equalize opportunity for higher education. He was a\nmember of the Oxford School board and played a part in the foundation\nof the Oxford School for Boys. He was an important factor in the\nuniversity extension movement, he sought to open university education\nto women, and he advocated the use of scholarships and other subsidies\nto make a university education available to the working classes.\n\nGreen was married in 1871 to Charlotte Symonds. The Greens had no\nchildren. Never a man of robust health, Green fell ill with sepsis in\n1882 and died on March 15, just a few days before his forty-sixth\n birthday.[1]\n\nGreen published a fairly small number of articles, reviews, and\npamphlets during his lifetime. He wrote the influential critical\ncommentary on Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature, which\nwas part of The Philosophical Works of David Hume, that he\nand T.H. Grose edited and published in 1874. In addition, he wrote a\nthree-part article \u201cCan There Be a Natural Science of\nMan?\u201d published in Mind in 1882, the year he died.\nThese two works reflect metaphysical and epistemological themes that\nwere incorporated into Book I of Green\u2019s Prolegomena to\nEthics, published posthumously in 1883. In addition,\nGreen\u2019s \u201cLecture on Liberal Legislation and the Freedom of\nContract\u201d was published in 1881 (Works III).\nGreen\u2019s other main philosophical works were published\nposthumously. This includes Green\u2019s most important work, the\nProlegomena to Ethics. The Prolegomena was\nsubstantially completed prior to Green\u2019s death, except for\n20\u201330 pages which he had hoped to add. At Green\u2019s\ninstructions, A.C. Bradley oversaw the Prolegomena\u2019s\npublication in\n 1883.[2]\n Other important posthumous publications include his essay \u201cOn\nthe Different Senses of \u2018Freedom\u2019 as Applied to Will and\nto the Moral Progress of Man,\u201d his Lectures on the Philosophy of\nKant, and his Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation (all in Works II).\n\nGreen\u2019s metaphysical, ethical, and political views were\ninfluential, especially in Britain (Nettleship 1888; Richter 1964).\nBecause Green\u2019s most important work was published posthumously,\nhis direct influence on others results largely from his teaching,\npublic lectures, and political activities. Though Green sometimes\ndespaired of his ability to present idealist principles in a clear and\nrigorous fashion, he nonetheless inspired many students and peers by\nhis intellectual, moral, and spiritual seriousness (Works V\n444\u201348,\n 485).[3]\n His metaphysical and ethical views were sympathetically received and\ndeveloped in Britain by Bernard Bosanquet, A.C. Bradley, F.H. Bradley,\nEdward Caird, R.B. Haldane, J.S. Mackenzie, J.H. Muirhead, R.L.\nNettleship, Hastings Rashdall, D.G. Ritchie, Arnold Toynbee, and\nWilliam Wallace.\n\nGreen\u2019s political influence was also significant. Beyond the\nspecific economic, political, and educational reforms for which Green\nadvocated, he had an important impact on the direction of the Liberal\nParty in Britain. His egalitarian concern with human perfection,\nespecially his insistence that laws and institutions serve the common\ngood, provided an intellectual foundation for the development of a new\nform of liberalism that required the state not simply to forbear from\ninterfering in the liberties and opportunities of its citizens but\nalso to provide various positive conditions and resources on which\ncitizens may draw in pursuing better lives. Despite significant\ndifferences among them, a number of influential figures in the New\nLiberalism can claim to be heirs of Green\u2019s political\nphilosophy, including Bosanquet, Ritchie, and L.T. Hobhouse.\n",
