    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || The Plethora of False Theories\n2.4 The Plethora of False Theories\n\nThe most famous history-based argument against realism, issued by\nLarry Laudan (1981), was meant to show how the explanatory link\nbetween success and truthlikeness is undermined by taking seriously\nthe history of science. It should be noted that Laudan\u2019s\nargument has been subjected to several diverging interpretations,\nwhich will be the focus of section 2.8. For the time being let\u2019s\nstick to a particularly popular one, according to which Laudan argues\ninductively from the falsity of past theories to the falsity of\ncurrent ones. This argument may be put thus:\n\n(L)\nThe history of science is full of theories which had been\nempirically successful for long periods of time and yet were shown to\nbe false about the deep-structure claims they had made about the\nworld. It is similarly full of theoretical terms featuring in\nsuccessful theories which do not refer. Therefore, by a simple (meta)\ninduction on scientific theories, our current successful theories are\nlikely to be false.\n\n\nLaudan substantiated (L) by means of what he has called \u201cthe\nhistorical gambit\u201d: the following list\u2014which \u201ccould\nbe extended ad nauseam\u201d\u2014gives theories which were\nonce empirically successful and fruitful, yet just false.\n\nLaudan\u2019s list of successful-yet-false theories\n\n the crystalline spheres of ancient and medieval astronomy\n the humoral theory of medicine\n the effluvial theory of static electricity\n catastrophist geology, with its commitment to a universal\n(Noachian) deluge\n the phlogiston theory of chemistry\n the caloric theory of heat\n the vibratory theory of heat\n the vital force theory of physiology\n the theory of circular inertia\n theories of spontaneous generation\n the contact-action gravitational ether of Fatio and LeSage\n the optical ether\n the electromagnetic ether\n\n\nThis is a list of a dozen of cases, but Laudan boldly noted the famous\n6 to 1 ratio:\n\n\nI daresay that for every highly successful theory in the past of\nscience which we now believe to be a genuinely referring theory, one\ncould find half a dozen once successful theories which we now regard\nas substantially non-referring. (1981: 35)\n\n\nIf we are to take seriously this \u201cplethora\u201d of theories\nthat were both successful and false, it appears that (L) is meant to\nbe a genuinely inductive argument.\n\n(I)\nThere has been a plethora of theories (ratio 6 to 1)\nwhich were successful and yet not truthlike.\n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that current theories will not be\ntruthlike (despite their success).\n\n\nAn argument such as (I) has obvious flaws. Two are the most important.\nThe first is that the basis for induction is hard to assess. This does\nnot just concern the 6:1 ratio, of which one may ask: where does\nit come from? It also concerns the issue of how we individuate\nand count theories as well as how we judge success and referential\nfailure. Unless we are clear on all these issues in advance of the\ninductive argument, we cannot even start putting together the\ninductive evidence for its conclusion (cf. Mizrahi 2013).\n\nThe second flaw of (I) is that the conclusion is too strong.\nIt is supposed to be that there is rational warrant for the judgment\nthat current theories are not truthlike. The flaw with this\nkind of sweeping generalization is precisely that it totally\ndisregards the fresh strong evidence there is for current\ntheories\u2014it renders current evidence totally irrelevant to the\nissue of their probability of being true. Surely this is unwarranted.\nNot only because it disregards potentially important differences in\nthe quality and quantity of evidence there is for current theories\n(differences that would justify treating current theories as more\nsupported by available evidence than past theories were by the then\navailable evidence); but also because it makes a mockery of looking\nfor evidence for scientific theories! If I know that X is\nmore likely than Y and that this relation cannot change by\ndoing Z, there is no point in doing Z. \n\nThe second flaw of (I) becomes (even more) apparent when one takes a\ncloser look at the successful-yet-false theories in Laudan\u2019s\nlist. Would anyone be willing to insist that, say, the humoral theory\nof medicine, the vital force theory of physiology or the theory of\ncrystalline spheres are on a par with our current scientific theories\nwith the same domain of application? The difference between their\nrespective evidence is undoubtedly enormous. Nevertheless, it would\nrather be mistaken to restrict our attention to those theories\ncomprising Laudan\u2019s own list. Indeed, subsequent\nscholars have provided new lists of cases where admittedly false\ntheories had been used in the derivation of impressive empirical\npredictions. Most notably, Timothy Lyons (2002: 70\u201372) and Peter\nVickers (2013: 191\u2013194) suggest the following (partly overlapping)\nlists:\n\nLyons\u2019s list\n\nCaloric Theory \nPhlogiston Theory\nRankine\u2019s 19th Century Vortex Theory\nNewtonian Mechanics\nFermat\u2019s Principle of Least Time\nFresnel\u2019s Wave Theory of Light and of the Optical Ether\nMaxwell\u2019s Ether Theory\nDalton\u2019s Atomic Theory\nKekul\u00e9\u2019s Theory of Benzene Molecule\nMendeleev\u2019s Periodic Law\nBohr\u2019s Theory of the Atom\nDirac\u2019s Relativistic Wave Equation\nThe Original (pre-inflationary) Big Bang Theory \n\n\nVickers\u2019s list\n\nCaloric Theory\nPhlogiston Theory\nFresnel\u2019s theory of light and the luminiferous ether \nRankine\u2019s vortex theory of thermodynamics \nKekul\u00e9\u2019s Theory of Benzene Molecule\nDirac and the positron \nTeleomechanism and gill slits \nReduction division in the formation of sex cells \nThe Titius-Bode law \nKepler\u2019s predictions concerning the rotation of the sun\n\nKirchhoff\u2019s theory of diffraction\nBohr\u2019s prediction of the spectral lines of ionized\nhelium\nSommerfeld\u2019s prediction of the hydrogen fine structure \nVelikovsky and Venus \nSteady state cosmology \nThe achromatic telescope\nThe momentum of light\nS-matrix theory\nVariation of electron mass with velocity \nTaking the thermodynamic limit\n\n\nThese lists summarize much of the work done by historians of science\nand historically informed philosophers of science. They are meant to\npresent cases of empirical successes that were (supposedly) brought\nabout by false theoretical hypotheses, hence offering a fresh source\nof historical challenges to realism. At first sight, the cases\nprovided look substantially different from the majority of\nLaudan\u2019s examples (viz. the successes, in at least some of them,\nare more impressive). Yet, it remains to be seen whether they are more\ntroublesome for scientific realism.\n",
