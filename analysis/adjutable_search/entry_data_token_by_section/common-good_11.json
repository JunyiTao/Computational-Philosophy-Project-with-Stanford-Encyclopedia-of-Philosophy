The Common Good Perspective: Communal or Distributive?\n\nOne of the most important differences among different conceptions of\nthe common good has to do with how they take private and sectional\ninterests to factor into determining the relational obligations of\ncitizens. Here we can distinguish two main types of views:\n(a) communal conceptions of the common good and\n(b) distributive conceptions of the common good.\n\nMembers of a political community have a relational obligation to care\nfor certain interests that they have in common. A\n\u201ccommunal\u201d conception of the common good takes these\ninterests to be interests that citizens have as citizens,\nwhere the status of being a citizen and the interests attached to this\nstatus are both understood to be prior to the various\nstatuses and interests that make up each member\u2019s identity as a\nprivate individual. When citizens engage in social deliberation about\ntheir laws and institutions, a communal conception typically directs\nthem to abstract away from their private interests and the sectional\ninterests they may have as members of one subgroup or another and to\nfocus instead on their common interests as citizens.\n\nFor example, imagine that citizens are considering changes to trade\nrules in their society. They may be inclined to assess proposals in\nterms of how attractive these are from the standpoint of their\nsectional interests as members of a certain profession or participants\nin a certain industry. But a communal conception of the common good\ndirects citizens to set these interests aside and assess proposals in\nterms of how well they answer to common civic interests, such as the\ninterest in national security or the interest in a productive\neconomy.[17]\n\nA \u201cdistributive\u201d conception of the common good differs\nfrom a \u201ccommunal\u201d conception in that it does not direct\ncitizens to abstract away from their private and sectional interests\nin the same way. A distributive conception starts with the idea that\ncitizens belong to various groups with distinct sectional\ninterests. These interests make partly competing claims on the\nmaterial, cultural and institutional facilities in a community. The\ndistributive conception incorporates a distributive principle that\ndetermines how social facilities should answer to these sectional\ninterests, and the conception says that members have a relational\nobligation to maintain a set of facilities that answers to\neveryone\u2019s sectional interests in the way that the distributive\nprinciple prescribes.\n\nAs an example of a distributive view, consider the view held by many\nphilosophers, which defines the common good in terms of Rawls\u2019s\ndifference principle (see, e.g., J. Cohen 1996 [2009: 169\u2013170];\nsee also  section 8 below). \nAccording to this view, we can think of citizens as belonging to\nvarious subgroups, each consisting of all those born into a certain\n\u201cstarting position\u201d in social life. Citizens in each group\nshare certain choice-independent characteristics, such as their class\nposition at birth and their level of innate talent. Group members have\nsectional interests in better life prospects (as measured in terms of\nprimary goods), where these interests make partly competing claims on\nthe basic structure of society. The difference principle says that\nsocial institutions should answer to the interests of each group\nequally, with the caveat that institutions should incorporate whatever\ninequalities would serve to maximize the prospects of the least\nadvantaged group. Citizens are then understood to have a relational\nobligation to maintain a scheme of institutions that attends to\neveryone\u2019s sectional interests in the way that the difference\nprinciple prescribes.\n\nThe disagreement between communal and distributive conceptions of the\ncommon good is perhaps the most important disagreement among different\nconceptions, and it raises some important questions about the nature\nof the political relationship. Let me make two general points.\n\nThe first has to do with the moral underpinnings of the communal\nview. It is helpful to think of communal accounts of the common good\nas appealing to a certain conception social life (e.g., Rousseau\n1762b; Hegel 1821; Walzer 1983). According to this conception,\ncitizens form their various private and sectional interests within the\nframework of a more fundamental effort to maintain certain social\nconditions together. The political bond is prior to their private\ninterests in a certain way, so the political relationship may\nsometimes require citizens to set their private interests aside in\norder to act collectively to maintain the relevant social conditions.\nPerhaps the clearest example of this is national\ndefense (see section 9\n below). When defending the constitutional order against a foreign\nthreat, political morality requires citizens to act collectively in\ndefense of common interests, without organizing their efforts in a way\nthat answers specifically to their competing private interests in\ndifferent levels of protection.\n\nAn analogy may help here. Members of a family each have distinct\ninterests as private individuals\u2014e.g., in developing their\ntalents, pursuing relationships, cultivating career prospects, and so on. At some level,\nthe household must be organized in a way that answers to these\nprivate interests. But there are some matters where the familial\nrelationship requires members to act together in a way that sets their\ncompeting private interests aside. If the family home is on fire,\nmembers are required to save the home, without special regard for how\nresources are being deployed in ways that are more likely to save one\nmember\u2019s room rather than another\u2019s. In certain domains,\nmembers are supposed to act from a communal point of view that focuses\non common interests that are essential to their social bond, rather\nthan their distinct and potentially competing interests as private\nindividuals. Communal conceptions of the common good see the political\nrelationship as having a similar\n character.[18]\n\nThe second point is that\u2014surprisingly\u2014Rawls himself\nfavours a substantially communal rather than distributive conception\nof the common good. In A Theory of Justice, he does not\ndefine the common good in terms of his full conception of social\njustice. He defines it instead in terms of the \u201cprinciple of\ncommon interest\u201d. This principle assesses social institutions\nfrom the position of equal citizenship. As he says, \u201cas far as\npossible, the basic structure should be appraised from the position of\nequal citizenship\u201d where this position \u201cis defined by the\nrights and liberties required by the principle of equal liberty and\nthe principle of fair equality of opportunity\u201d (1971 [1999:\n82\u201383]). Rawls thinks that a wide variety of policy questions\ncan be settled by appeal to the principle of common interest,\nincluding \u201creasonable regulations to maintain public\norder\u201d, \u201cefficient measures for public health and\nsafety\u201d, and \u201ccollective efforts for national defense in a\njust war\u201d (1971 [1999: 83]).[19]\n\nSocial deliberation, on Rawls\u2019s view, should unfold, as far as\npossible, within a framework of reasoning that focuses on interests\nthat are common to all citizens, where the difference principle enters\nthe discussion mainly when the appeal to common interests alone could\nnot properly decide an issue. But why should political deliberation\nunfold in this way? Why does Rawls think that, \u201cas far as\npossible, the basic structure should be appraised from the position of\nequal citizenship\u201d? \n\nOne possible rationale has to do with the kind of solidarity that\ncitizens realize through their shared status as\n\u201ccitizens\u201d. When members of a society reason in terms of\nthe principle of common interest, they set their private and sectional\ninterests aside whenever possible in order to focus on their common\ninterests as citizens. Setting their sectional interests aside (e.g.,\nas members of the least advantaged group, the second least advantaged\ngroup, the third least advantaged group, etc.), citizens treat their\nshared interests as \u201ccitizens\u201d as being more fundamental\nthan their distinct and potentially competing interests as private\nindividuals. Each citizen effectively tells her fellow citizens,\n\u201cWhat unites us is more important than what divides\nus\u201d. Bringing the status of \u201ccitizen\u201d to the center\nof how citizens relate to one another in public life is particularly\nimportant for Rawls because mutual recognition on the basis of this\nshared status is important to his account of how a just social order\nwill prevent envy and positional competition from undermining the\nbasic liberties (1971 [1999: 476\u20139]).\n\nA closely related idea has to do with mutuality (section\n 4.4\n and\n 4.5\nabove). When members of society reason in terms of their common\ninterests in liberty and opportunity, they assess policies from a\nstandpoint that does not distinguish between one citizen and\nanother. They each accord the interests of their fellow citizens the\nvery same status in their reasoning that they accord to their own\ninterests. When citizens do their parts in a social arrangement that\nanswers to common interests, and they do so on the grounds that the\narrangement serves common interests, citizens realize a form of\nsolidarity that is perfectly mutual: each citizen works for the\ninterests of each her fellow citizens in exactly the same way that\neach of her fellow citizens works for her interests.\n\nSocial cooperation on the basis of the difference principle does not\n embody the same kind of mutuality. Imagine that citizens are\nreasoning about their institutions. Starting with an arrangement that\ncreates equal prospects for those born into every starting position,\nthey consider different arrangements that would yield Pareto\nimprovements over the egalitarian\n scheme.[20]\n Citizens must now choose between different possibilities: one\narrangement would maximize the prospects for the least advantaged\ngroup; another would maximize the prospects for the second least\nadvantaged group; a third would maximize the prospects for the third\nleast advantaged group; and so on. Given these possibilities, the\ndifference principle requires citizens to choose the arrangement that\nis best from the standpoint of one group in particular\u2014i.e.,\nthose in the least advantaged position.\n\nImagine now that we live in a social order that satisfies the\ndifference principle. There are certain facilities in\nsociety\u2014say, certain educational facilities\u2014that answer\ndistinctively to the interests of those in the least advantaged\ngroup. The resources involved could have been deployed in ways that\nwould have been better for those in the second least advantaged group,\nor the third least advantaged group, etc., so the arrangement as a\nwhole is tilted in favour of one group in particular. Because it is\ntilted in this way, the pattern of interaction lacks the property of\nperfect mutuality: each citizen does not work for the interests of\neach of her fellow citizens in exactly the same way each of her fellow\ncitizens works for her interests. Everyone works in a way that is\ndistinctively oriented towards the interests of the least\nadvantaged.\n\nOf course, citizens realize a form of solidarity insofar as social\ncooperation is organized in light of the difference principle; the\npoint is just that citizens realize a distinctive form of solidarity\ninsofar as social cooperation is organized in light of the principle\nof common interest. In the latter case, they realize a\nmore communal form of solidarity, as citizens set their\nprivate interests aside to focus on common interests and citizens\nattach no special significance to the distinctions between different\ngroups. A more communal form of solidarity answers better to the\nsocial dimension of the political relationship and this may be one\nreason why Rawls favors a form of public reasoning in which the\nprinciple of common interest governs \u201cmatters which concern the\ninterests of everyone and in regard to which distributive effects are\nimmaterial or irrelevant\u201d (1971 [1999: 82\u201383]).\n",
