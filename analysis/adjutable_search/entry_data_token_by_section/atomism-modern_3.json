    "main_text": "Atomism in the Seventeenth Century || Natural Minima\n2.3 Natural Minima\n\n\nMany speculations about atoms in the seventeenth century came from a\nsource quite distinct from mechanical atomism. That source was the\ntheory of natural minima which had its roots in Aristotle and that was\ntransformed into a detailed atomic theory mainly applicable to\nchemical change.\n\n\nAristotle (On Generation and Corruption, Bk 1, Ch 10) clearly\nidentified what we would refer to as chemical change as a special\ncategory presenting problems peculiar to it. It differs from mere\nalteration, such as the browning of an autumn leaf, where an\nidentifiable material substratum persists, and from generation and\ncorruption, such as the transformation of an olive seed into a tree or\nthe decay of a rose into a heap of dust, where no identifiable\nmaterial substratum persists. The transformation of a mixture of\ncopper and tin into bronze, an example of what Aristotle called\ncombination, is intermediate between alteration and generation and\ncorruption. Copper and tin do not persist as such in the bronze and to\nassume so would fail to make the appropriate distinction between a\ncombination and a mixture. Nevertheless, there is some important sense\nin which the copper and tin are in the bronze because they are\nrecoverable from it.  Aristotle had put his finger on a central\nproblem in chemistry, the sense in which elements combine to form\ncompounds and yet remain in the compounds as components of\nthem. Aristotle did not use this terminology, of course, and it should\nbe recognised that he and the scholastics that followed him had few\nexamples of combination, as opposed to alteration and generation and\ncorruption, to draw on.  Alloys, which provided them with their stock\nand just about only example, are not even compounds from a modern\npoint of view. The importance of combination for Aristotelians lay in\nthe philosophical challenge it posed.\n\n\nMany scholastics came to understand combination as the coming together\nof the least parts of the combining substances to form least parts of\nthe compound. These least parts were referred to as natural\nminima. Substances cannot be divided indefinitely, it was claimed,\nbecause division will eventually result in natural minima which are\neither indivisible or are such that, if divided, no longer constitute\na portion of the divided substance. But the theory of natural minima\nwas developed to a stage where it involved more than that. The minima\nwere presumed to exist as parts of a substance quite independent of\nany process of division. What is more, chemical combination was\nunderstood as coming about via the combination of minima of the\ncombining substances forming minima of the compound. Talk of chemical\ncombination taking place \u2018per minima\u2019 became common.\n\n\nNatural minima were presumed by the scholastics to owe their being\nboth to matter and form in standard Aristotelian fashion. A key\nproblem they struggled with concerned the relation of the form\ncharacteristic of the minima of combining substances and the form of\nthe minima of the resulting compound. Natural minima of copper and tin\ncannot remain as such in the minima of bronze otherwise the properties\nof copper and tin would persist in bronze. On the other hand, the form\nof copper and tin must persist in some way to account for the fact\nthat those metals can be recovered. A common scholastic response was\nto presume that the forms of the combining minima persist in the\nminima of the resulting compound but in a way that is subservient to\nthe form of those latter minima. Elements persist in the compound\nsomewhat as individual notes persist in a chord.\n\n\nWhilst Aristotle and the scholastics can be given the credit for\npinpointing a fundamental problem associated with chemical change they\ncan hardly be credited with providing a definitive solution. It should\nbe recognised that adding the assumption of natural minima does not\ncontribute in any way to a solution to the problem posed by chemical\nchange. The problem of understanding how components persist in\ncompounds simply becomes transferred to the problem of how minima of\ncomponents persist in minima of compounds. So the extent to which\nacceptance of natural minima became widespread cannot be explained in\nterms of their contribution to a solution to the fundamental problem\nof chemical change. There were a number of motivations for assuming\nminima, all having at least their germs in Aristotle. One idea was\nthat a portion of a substance can resist the corrupting influence of\nthe surrounding medium only if there is a sufficient amount of\nit. Another stemmed from the common recognition that substances must\ncome into contact if they are to combine. The particulate nature of\nsubstances facilitates such contact, as Aristotle hinted (On\nGeneration and Corruption, 1, 10, 328a, 34). A third motivation\nconcerned the logical problems, dating back to Zeno, that were\nunderstood to flow from assuming infinite divisibility.\n\n\nRecognising the need to avoid problems perceived to be associated with\ninfinite divisibility was a point shared by proponents of natural\nminima and mechanical atomists. But this one point of contact must not\nblind us to the crucial differences between the two traditions.\nMechanical atoms were proposed as components of matter in\ngeneral. They were unchangeable and possessed a minimum of properties,\nshape, size and a degree of motion or rest together with the\nimpenetrability of their component matter. The motivation for\nascribing just those properties to atoms was to provide an\nintelligible account of being and change in general. By contrast,\nnatural minima possess properties characteristic of the substances of\nwhich they are the minima. The minima are not unchangeable because\nthey are transformed into more complicated minima via chemical\ncombination. The minima were not basic building blocks for the\nscholastics that developed this theory because their properties needed\nto be traced back to their composition from the four Aristotelian\nelements. Finally, the minima theory was developed as an attempt to\naccommodate chemical change. It was not intended as a theory of\neverything in the way that mechanical atomism was.\n",
