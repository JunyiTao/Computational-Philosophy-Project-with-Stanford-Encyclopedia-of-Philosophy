From a linguistic point of view, objects\nare the referents of singular terms, be they concrete or abstract. In\nline with Husserl\u2019s LI, early phenomenology takes the category\nof object to be divided into the two sub-categories of real and ideal\nobjects, which are distinguished by their relation to time (cf. Hua\nXIX 129f). Ideal objects are atemporal; these are usually taken to be\neither general or individual objects. Properties and essences are\ngeneral because they can be predicated of several objects. By\ncontrast, ideal objects, which cannot be predicated of anything else,\nare individual. So, e.g., Reinach takes natural numbers to be ideal\nand individual for they are not predicated of other entities\n(1911c [1989: 58]; 1914 [1989: 539f]). Real objects are temporal, and\nthis category is traditionally divided into material and mental\nobjects. Over the years, this standard classification underwent\nsubstantial revision: in particular, the increasing attention devoted\nto social ontology led phenomenology to enrich its table of categories\n(Salice 2013). For instance, the case of entities like promissory\nclaims and obligations called into question the strong connection\nhitherto endorsed or presupposed between ideality and temporality: on\nthe one hand, these entities are neither material nor mental; on the\nother, they are temporal (they are brought about by a successful\npromise and extinguish when the promise is honored). Also, we have\nalready seen that investigations into aesthetics led some\nphenomenologists to accept the existence of essences that are ideal,\nbut nonetheless temporal or historical (for a similar conception, see\nalso Husserl\u2019s notion of \u201cbound idealities\u201d, 1938:\n321).\n\nStates of affairs are the objectual correlates of propositional\nattitudes like assumptions and judgments. Judging always is judging\nthat something is or is not the case. That which is or is not\nthe case is the state of affairs the mental attitude is directed\ntowards. States of affairs are the referents of declarative sentences\nas well as of perfect nominals (perfect nominals are linguistic\nconstructions that contain a gerund and can syntactically act as\nnames, e.g., \u201cthe rose\u2019s being red\u201d, cf. Vendler\n1967). The German expression for state of affairs is\nSachverhalt, which apparently was introduced in the Brentano\nSchool around 1888 by Carl Stumpf (Rojszczak & Smith 2003: 165;\nMeinong\u2019s equivalent reads \u201cobjective\n[Objektiv]\u201d, Salice 2009). The term has its roots in\njurisprudence (Smith 1978a) where it is used to express the\n\u201cjuridical \u2018status\u2019 in the sense of \u2018status\nrerum\u2019 (state or constitution of things)\u201d (Smith 1988:\n25). This is conducive to how early phenomenologists use the term\nSachverhalt: objects or things have an ontological structure,\nand this is a structure of states of affairs. (When this structure\ninvolves a value-property, then phenomenologists sometimes talk of a\n\u201cstate of value\u201d [Wertverhalt]).\n\nEarly phenomenological debate about these entities extends over many\nyears and is animated by various positions. These different positions\ncan be sorted into two more or less well-defined competing views.\nAccording to the first, all states of affairs have an ontological\nstatus of their own, which is intentionality-independent. The second\nview claims that only a restricted class of states of affairs are\nintentionality-independent entities. On this second view,\nnon-obtaining states of affairs (e.g., Elvis\u2019 being the\npresident of the US) or negative states of affairs (e.g., the not\nbeing red of the White House) or existential states of affairs (the\nexistence of Barack Obama) or impersonal states of affairs (the state\nof affairs that it is raining) and/or other kinds of state of affairs\nhave been argued to be intentionality-dependent.\n\nIn this debate, Reinach\u2019s theory represents one extreme position\n(Reinach 1911a): according to him, all meaningful declarative\nsentences are directed towards states of affairs. True sentences\n(i.e., those sentences which express true propositions) refer to\nobtaining states of affairs, false ones to non-obtaining. States of\naffairs make propositions true or false: they are truth-makers and the\ncorresponding propositions truth-bearers. Reinach does not elaborate\non the truth-making relation, but an interesting account of this\nrelation in terms of the principle of sufficient reason is developed\nby Pf\u00e4nder in his Logic of 1921 (see also Mulligan\n2008b).\n\nIn addition, Reinach suggests that states of affairs are either\npositive or negative, and he argues that either a positive state of\naffairs or its negative contradictory obtains (e.g., either the\nbeing-red of the rose obtains or its not-being red). The principle of\nthe excluded middle is hence claimed to hold for states of affairs\nand, analogously, other principles traditionally believed to be of a\nlogical nature (and in particular the laws of inference, see 1911a\n[1989: 115]) are interpreted by Reinach as being primarily ontological\nprinciples, i.e., principles which hold for states of affairs. That\nis, states of affairs are the objects of logic (1911a [1989: 138 n\n1]), and logic is primarily about states of affairs and only\nsecondarily about truth-bearers (on this point, see also Gallinger\n1912, Honecker 1921, Gardies 1985).\n\nAn ontologically more parsimonious counterpart to this first position\nwas developed by Daubert. In his theory of judgment, Daubert draws a\ndistinction between two notions. First, he calls \u201cstates of\naffairs\u201d complex entities which exist independently of\nintentionality, e.g., the being-red of the rose (cf. Schuhmann &\nSmith 1987; Schuhmann 2004c). In addition to states of affairs, he\nalso identifies so-called \u201cstates of affairs as cognized\u201d\n(Kenntnisverhalte), which are described as\nintentionality-dependent entities. (Although using different\nterminology, Pf\u00e4nder, too, seems to have had a similar\ndistinction in mind in 1921 when he speaks of \u201cthe objects in\ntheir objectual state\u201d (das Selbstverhalten der\nGegenst\u00e4nde) and of \u201cstates of affairs\u201d as\nentities which are \u201cprojected or outlined\u201d\n(entworfen) by judgment and which are \u201ccompletely\ndependent\u201d on judgment, Pf\u00e4nder 1921: 40f, 253.)\n\nDaubert\u2019s idea is that, within a judgment, an aspect of the\nstate of affairs is selected by the mind and conceptually framed. So,\nfor instance, the expressions\n\n\u201cthe chairman opens the meeting\u201d,\n\u201cthe chairman is opening the meeting\u201d,\n\u201cthe meeting is being opened by the chairman\u201d,\n\u201cthe opening of the meeting is being conducted by the\nchairman\u201d and\n\u201cthe chairman has opened the meeting\u201d, (cf. Schuhmann\n& Smith 1987: 368)\n\n\npoint at different \u201cstates of affairs as cognized\u201d\n(Kenntnisverhalte) to which the same state of affairs\npertains. The same can be said for expressions such as \u201ca >\nb\u201d and \u201cb < a\u201d. In the\nLI, Husserl employs this very same example to argue that the two\nsentences express different propositional meanings pointing at the\nsame state of affairs (Hua XIX A 48). Daubert reports having discussed\nthis example with Husserl (Schuhmann 2004c: 206 n 25), which might\nhave inspired Husserl to replace his previous theory of the LI with\nhis later distinction, which is analogous to Daubert\u2019s own,\nbetween states of affairs and situations (Sachlagen, see Hua\nXXVI 97f, Husserl 1938: 285ff).\n\nTo be sure, Reinach, too, distinguishes between coarse-grained\n\u201cfactual material\u201d (Tatbestand) and fine-grained\nstates of affairs (Smith 1987: 218ff). Yet, contrary to Reinach,\nDaubert contends that states of affairs as cognized do not exist\nwithout corresponding judgments. Moreover, Daubert claims that,\nanalogously to states of affairs as cognized, states of affairs as\nquestioned (Frageverhalte) or as ordered\n(Befehlsverhalte) also exist only in relation to acts of\nquestion or of order (Schuhmann 2004b: 91).\n\nDaubert\u2019s position raises the question as to what properties\nqualify states of affairs proper and what properties qualify states of\naffairs as cognized. For instance, Daubert holds that there are no\nnegative states of affairs, but only negative\nKenntnisverhalte (cf. Schuhmann 1987\u2014based on a\nsomewhat similar approach, Ingarden, too, denies the existence of\nintentionality-independent negative states of affairs, see 1964 II/1;\nChrudzimski 2010). Analogously, Pf\u00e4nder (1921: 72f) argues that,\nwhen it comes to giving an account of impersonal judgments, these have\nimpersonal states of affairs as their correlates, but the\nincompleteness that characterizes such states of affairs has no place\nat the level of reality, i.e., at the level of \u201cthe objects in\ntheir objectual state\u201d (a position which, again, is in agreement\nwith Daubert, Schuhmann 1998: 184).\n",
