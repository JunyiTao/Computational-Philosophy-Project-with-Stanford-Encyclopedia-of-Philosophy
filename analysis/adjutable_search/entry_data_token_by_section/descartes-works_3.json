    "main_text": "The Principles\n4. The Principles\n\nSoon after his encounter with the Sorbonne, Descartes\u2019 public\nlife was further complicated by the Dutch theologian, Gisbert Voetius\n(1588\u20131676). Voetius had attacked Regius, a Dutch physician who\ntaught medicine at the University of Utrecht, for his having taught\ncertain \u201cCartesian\u201d ideas that conflicted with traditional\ntheological doctrine. Regius was friend to both Reneri and Descartes,\nand was a strong adherent to Descartes\u2019s philosophical views.\nVoetius tried to have Regius removed from his position as professor,\nand attacked not only Descartes\u2019 work but his character. In his\ndefense Descartes entered into the debate. The controversy would leave\nRegius confined to teaching medicine, and his published defense of\n(his conception of) Cartesian thought would be officially condemned by\nVoetius, who in five years time would rise to the position of\nUniversity rector. At the end of the debate, which off and on lasted\nabout five years, the situation ultimately became desperate for\nDescartes. He feared being expelled from the country and of seeing his\nbooks burned. He would even seek protection by asking the Prince of\nOrange to intervene and quell Voetius\u2019 attack.\n\nIn 1643, at the age of forty-seven, Descartes moved to Egmond du Hoef.\nWith the Voetius controversy seemingly behind him (though, as\nmentioned above, it would again raise its head and climax five years\ndown the road), Descartes and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia began to\ncorrespond. In this exchange, Princess Elisabeth probed Descartes on\nthe implications of his commitment to mind-body dualism. During this\ntime, he completed a final draft of a new textbook, which he had begun\nthree years earlier, the Principia Philosophiae\n(Principles of Philosophy), and in 1644 it was published. He\ndedicated it to Princess Elisabeth.\n\nThe Principles is an important text. The work is divided into\nfour Parts, with five hundred and four articles. Part One develops\nDescartes\u2019 metaphysics. Although it would appear to be a quick\nrun through of the Meditations, there are a number of\ndissimilarities. For example, the order of presentation of the proofs\nfor God\u2019s existence, which some have argued is significant,\nfound in the Third and Fifth Meditations, is reversed in the\nPrinciples. The principles introduced in Part Two are based\non the metaphysics of Part One. And, the subsequent physics developed\nin Parts Three and Four is based upon the principles of Part Two.\nAlthough the physics turns out to be unsound, the Principles\nnevertheless inspired such great thinkers as Robert Boyle\n(1627\u20131691), Edmond Halley (1656\u20131742), and Isaac Newton.\nAs an important side note, it must be stressed that even though\nDescartes had throughout his career put a great deal of emphasis on\nmathematics, the physics developed in the Principles does not\nappear to be a mathematical physics. Rather, it is traditionally taken\nto be a conceptual project with only a hint of empirical\novertones\u2014a physics rooted entirely in metaphysics. Arguably,\nhowever, Descartes\u2019 work on enumeration, order, and measure in\nthe Rules provides the conceptual machinery necessary for\nestablishing a \u2018mathematical\u2019 physics\u2014a conceptual\nmachinery that is carried over to the Principles (Smith 2003,\n2010). Two parts, never completed, were originally intended to deal\nwith plants, animals, and man. In light of this and what Descartes\nsays in a 31 January 1642 letter to the mathematician Constantijn\nHuygens, it is plausible to think that the Principles would\nhave looked something like The World had it been completed as\nplanned.\n\nOne of the more controversial positions the Principles\nforwarded, at least according to Newton, was that a vacuum was\nimpossible. Descartes\u2019 rejection of the possibility of a vacuum\nfollowed from his commitment to the view that the essence of body was\nextension. Given that extension is an attribute, and that nothing\ncannot possess any attributes (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210), it follows\nthat \u201cnothingness cannot possess any extension\u201d (AT VIIIA\n50; CSM I 231). So, any instance of extension would entail the\npresence of some substance (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210). In other words,\nvacuum, taken as an extended nothing, is a flat\ncontradiction. The corporeal universe is thus a plenum, individual\nbodies separated only by their surfaces. Newton argued in his De\nGravitatione and Principia that the concept of motion\nbecomes problematic if the universe is taken to be a plenum. Another\ncontroversial position was Descartes\u2019 insistence that matter is\ninfinitely divisible. Gassendi, and later Cordemoy, argued that there\nmust be a bottom, a \u2018substance,\u2019 to the physical universe\nupon which the being of all corporeal things depend. In line with the\nancient atomist Epicurus, they argued that if matter was infinitely\ndivisible, so dividing it would show that there was no\nbottom\u2014and so, corporeality would not be substantial. So, if\ncorporeality is substantial, as Descartes himself had claimed, there\nmust be a minimum measure of extension that could not be divided (by\nnatural means, anyway). And so, there are atoms. But, this conclusion\nis something that Descartes explicitly rejects in the\nPrinciples.\n",
