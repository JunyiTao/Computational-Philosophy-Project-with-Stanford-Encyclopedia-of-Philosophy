    "main_text": "The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality || Relativity\n8.3 Relativity\n\n\nJarrett (1984, 1989), Ballentine and Jarrett (1997) and Shimony (1984)\nhold that superluminal signaling is incompatible with relativity\ntheory. Accordingly, they conclude that violations of PI are\nincompatible with relativity theory, whereas violations of OI may be\ncompatible with this theory. Furthermore, Sutherland (1985, 1989)\nargues that deterministic, relativistic parameter-dependent theories\n(i.e., relativistic, deterministic theories that violate PI) would\nplausibly require retro-causal influences, and in certain experimental\ncircumstances this type of influences would give rise to causal\nparadoxes, i.e., inconsistent closed causal loops (where effects\nundermine their very causes). And Arntzenius (1994) argues that all\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories are impossible on pain of\ncausal paradoxes. That is, he argues that in certain experimental\ncircumstances any relativistic, parameter-dependent theory would give\nrise to closed causal loops in which violations of PI could not\nobtain.  \n\n\nIt is noteworthy that the view that relativity per se is\nincompatible with superluminal signaling is disputable (for more\ndetails, see section 10). Anyway, recalling (section 8.2), if\n\u03bb-distribution is excluded as a matter of law, it will be\nimpossible even in theory to exploit the violation of PI to give rise\nto superluminal signaling, in which case the possibility of\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories could not be discounted on\nthe basis of superluminal signaling.\n\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned in section 7.1 and 7.4, the in-principle\npossibility of superluminal signaling in theories that satisfy PI and\nviolate OI cannot be excluded a priori. Thus, if relativity\ntheory excludes superluminal signaling, the argument from superluminal\nsignaling may also be applied to exclude the possibility of some\nrelativistic outcome-dependent theories. \n\n\nFinally, Berkovitz (2002) argues that Arntzenius's argument for the\nimpossibility of relativistic theories that violate PI is based on\nassumptions about probabilities that are common in linear causal\nsituations but are unwarranted in causal loops, and that the real\nchallenge for these theories is that in such loops their predictive\npower is undermined (for more details, see section 10.3). \n",
