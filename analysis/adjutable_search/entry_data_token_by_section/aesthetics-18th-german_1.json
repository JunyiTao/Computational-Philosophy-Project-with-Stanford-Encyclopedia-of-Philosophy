    "main_text": "Leibniz and Wolff: Perfection and Truth || Leibniz\n1.1 Leibniz\n The two key ideas that Wolff takes from Leibniz are, first, the\ncharacterization of sensory perception as a clear but confused rather\nthan distinct perception of things that could, at least in principle,\nbe known both clearly and distinctly by the intellect; and, second,\nthe characterization of pleasure as the sensory, and thus clear but\nconfused, perception of the perfection of things. Leibniz\u2019s conception\nof sensory perception was presented in a 1684 paper entitled\n\u201cMeditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas.\u201d Here Leibniz\nstated that \u201cKnowledge is clear\u2026when it makes it\npossible for me to recognize the thing represented,\u201d but that it\nis \u201cconfused when I cannot enumerate one by one the\nmarks which are sufficient to distinguish the thing from others, even\nthough the thing may in truth have such marks and constituents into\nwhich its concept can be resolved.\u201d Conversely, knowledge is\nboth clear and distinct when one can not only clearly distinguish its\nobject from other objects but can also enumerate the\n\u201cmarks\u201d or properties of the object on which that\ndistinction is based.  Leibniz then says that sensory perception is\nclear but indistinct or confused knowledge, and illustrates his\ngeneral thesis about sense perception with a remark about the\nperception and judgment of art: \u201cLikewise we sometimes see\npainters and other artists correctly judge what has been done well or\nbadly; yet they are often unable to give a reason for their judgment\nbut tell the inquirer that the work which displeases them lacks\n\u2018something, I know not what\u2019\u201d (Leibniz,\n\u201cMeditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas,\u201d\np. 291). This illustration would be decisive for Wolff and all of\nthose whom he in turn influenced.\n\n\nThe second idea that Wolff took over from Leibniz is the idea that\npleasure is itself the sensory perception of the perfection existing\nin an object. For Leibniz and all his followers, all of the properties of actually existing objects can\nbe regarded as perfections, since they held that the actual world is\nthe one selected to exist by God from among all possible worlds\nprecisely because it is the most perfect; thus each object and all of\nits properties must in some way contribute to the maximal perfection\nof the actual world. But they also used the concept of perfection in a\nmore ordinary way, in which some actual objects have specific\nperfections that others do not, and it is this sense of perfection\nthat Leibniz employed when he stated that\n\nPleasure is the feeling of a perfection or an excellence,\nwhether in ourselves or in something else. For the perfection of other\nbeings is also agreeable, such as understanding, courage, and\nespecially beauty in another human being, or in an animal or even in a\nlifeless creation, a painting or a work of craftsmanship, as\nwell.\n\n\nLeibniz also holds that the perfection that we perceive in other\nobjects is communicated to ourselves, although he does\nnot say that our pleasure in the perception of perfection is actually\ndirected at the self-perfection that is thereby caused. But there is\ncertainly a nascent view here that the perception of beauty in art,\nalthough not only in art, is both intrinsically pleasurable and also\ninstrumentally valuable because it leads to self-improvement.\n",
