    "main_text": "Psychology || Sentiency, Mind, and Consciousness\n2.7 Sentiency, Mind, and Consciousness\n\nDewey\u2019s accounts of sentiency, mind, and consciousness build\nupon those of impulse, perception, act, habit, and emotion. These are\ncomplex topics, but a cursory view can complete this sketch of\nDewey\u2019s psychology.\nSentiency\n\nAs with other psychic phenomena, sentience emerges through the\ntransactions of organisms in natural environments. In general,\ncreatures seek to satisfy needs and escape peril; when stability\nyields to precariousness, a struggle to reestablish balance begins;\nthere is adjustment to self, to one\u2019s environment, or both.\nMethods successful in the past, pre-organized responses, sometimes\nfail. In such cases, we become ambivalent\u2014divided against\nourselves about what to do next. It proves advantageous to\ninhibit practiced responses (to look before leaping); this\npause or inhibition of the action flow creates a space which, Dewey\nwrote, \u201cintroduces mental confusion, but also, in need for\nredirection, opportunity for observation, recollection,\nanticipation\u201d (EN, LW1: 237). In other words,\ninhibition creates ambivalence, and ambivalence makes possible new\nways of considering alternatives; crude, physical situations take on\nqualitatively new complexities of meaning. Thus, Dewey wrote,\nsentiency or feeling \n\n\nis in general a name for the newly actualized quality acquired by\nevents previously occurring upon a physical level, when these events\ncome into more extensive and delicate relationships of interaction.\n(EN, LW1: 204) \n\n\nAt this stage, the new relationships are not yet known; they\ndo, however, provide the conditions for knowing. Symbolization,\nlanguage, is the next step in liberating these noticed relationships\nusing intellectual tools including abstraction, memory, and\nimagination (EN, LW1: 199).\nMind\n\nDewey rejected both traditional accounts of mind-as-substance (or\ncontainer) and more contemporary schemes reducing mind to brain states\n(EN, LW1: 224\u2013225). Rather, mind is activity, a range\nof dynamic processes of interaction between organism and world.\nConsider the range connoted by mind: as memory (I am\nreminded of X); attention (I keep her in\nmind, I mind my manners); purpose (I have\nan aim in mind); care or solicitude (I\nmind the child); paying heed (I mind the\ntraffic stop). \u201cMind\u201d, then, ranges over many activities:\nintellectual, affectional, volitional, or purposeful. It is \n\n\nprimarily a verb\u2026[that] denotes every mode and variety of\ninterest in, and concern for, things: practical, intellectual, and\nemotional. It never denotes anything self-contained, isolated from the\nworld of persons and things, but is always used with respect to\nsituations, events, objects, persons and groups. (AE, LW10:\n267\u201368) \n\n\nAs Wittgenstein\n (entry on Wittgenstein, section on rule-following and private language)\n pointed out 30 years later, no private language (see\n entry on private language)\n is possible given this account of meaning. While meanings might be\nprivately entertained, they are not privately invented; meanings are\nsocial and emerge from symbol systems arising through collective\ncommunication and action (EN, LW1: 147).\n\nActive, complex animals are sentient due to the variety of distinctive\nconnections they have with their environment. But\n\u201cmentality\u201d (mindfulness) arises due to the eventual\nability to recognize and use meaningful signs. With language,\ncreatures can identify and differentiate feelings as\nfeelings, objects as objects, etc. \n\n\nWithout language, the qualities of organic action that are feelings\nare pains, pleasures, odors, colors, noises, tones, only potentially\nand proleptically. With language they are discriminated and\nidentified. They are then \u201cobjectified\u201d; they are\nimmediate traits of things. (EN, LW1: 198) \n\n\nThe bull\u2019s charge is stimulated by the red flag, but unlike the\ndriver ignoring a broken red stoplight, the bull cannot detach\n\u201cred\u201d as a sign; it remains a crude stimulus.\n\nDewey thus demoted and promoted the mind\u2019s significance. No\nlonger our spark of divinity, as some ancients held, it is also\nrescued from merely being a ghost in a machine. Mind becomes\nvital, investigating and addressing problems, and inventing\nnew tools, aims, and ideals. Mind bridges past and future, an\n\u201cagency of novel reconstruction of a pre-existing order\u201d\n(EN, LW1: 168).\nConsciousness\n\nLike mind, consciousness is also a verb\u2014the brisk transitioning\nof felt, qualitative events. Dewey was profoundly influenced by\nJames\u2019s metaphor of consciousness as a constantly moving\n\u201cstream of thought\u201d (FAE, LW5: 157). In the end,\nhowever, Dewey did not believe a fully adequate account of\nconsciousness could be captured in words. Talk about consciousness is\nelliptical\u2014it is \u201cvivid\u201d or\n\u201cconspicuous\u201d or \u201cdull\u201d\u2014and such\ncharacterizations are never quite adequate. Because the experience of\nconsciousness is ever-evanescent, we cannot fix it as we do for the\nobjects of our attention\u2014as, for example, \u201cpowers\u201d,\n\u201cthings\u201d, or \u201ccauses\u201d. Dewey, then, did not\ndefine consciousness, but evoked it using contrasts and instances.\nConsider these contrasts in Experience and Nature,\n(EN, LW1: 230)\n\n\nMind is\nConsciousness is  \n\nA whole system of meanings as embodied in organic life\nAwareness or perception of meanings (of actual events\nin their meaning)  \n\nContextual and persistent: a constant background \nFocal and transitive  \n\nStructural and substantial: a constant foreground \nA punctuated series of heres and nows  \n\nEnduring luminosity \nIntermittent flashes of varying intensities  \n\nA continuous transmission of messages \nThe occasional interception and singling out of a message that\nmakes it audible  \n\n\nGiven the processual, active nature of our psychology, Dewey was\nforced to depict consciousness with a dynamic, organismic vocabulary.\nConsciousness is thinking-in-motion, an ever-reconfiguring event\nseries that is qualitatively felt as experience transforms. Whereas\nmind is a \u201cstock\u201d of meanings, consciousness is\nrealization-and-reconstruction of meanings, enabling activities to be\nreorganized and redirected (EN, LW1: 233).\nConsciousness is drama; mind is the indispensable\nback story. This back story is not radically subjective; it is social,\nconstituted by communities past and present.\n\nDewey also tried to get at consciousness performatively, so to speak;\nhe provoked the reader to consider the nature of consciousness while\nreading. Here, again, he utilized notions of \u201cfocus\u201d and\n\u201cfringe\u201d, emphasizing how the latter is indispensable for\nmental orientation (EN, LW1: 231). As physical balance\ncontrols walking, mind\u2019s meanings constantly adjust and direct\npresent, focal interpretation. The progressive advance of vivid\nconsciousness is enabled by mind\u2019s pervasive and persistent\nsystem of meanings.\n\nHaving concluded this review of Dewey\u2019s psychology, we turn now\nto his account of experience.\n",
