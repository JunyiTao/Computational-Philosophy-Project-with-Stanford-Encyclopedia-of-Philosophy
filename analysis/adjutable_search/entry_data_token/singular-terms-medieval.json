The existence of\nsingular terms raises various questions about how they function within\na language. Do proper names have a sense as well as a referent? If\nthey do have a sense, what is it, and how do they acquire it? How is\nthis sense transmitted from one speaker to another? Is a demonstrative\npronoun purely referential? If one believes in a language of thought,\nor mental language, as did many medieval thinkers, what is the mental\ncorrelate of a singular term? While medieval thinkers did not produce\nany treatises devoted to singular terms, their writings do contain\nanswers to these questions, or at least, answers to similar questions\nthat they themselves posed in the context of their own semantic\ntheories. To discover medieval views of singular terms, one must\nconsult a variety of sources from grammar, logic, metaphysics, and\neven theology. Priscian, the semantically-oriented grammarian who\nwrote at the beginning of the sixth century C.E., was particularly\ninfluential, and his views were repeated by many later grammarians, as\nwell as by logicians and theologians. Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, or\nintroduction to Aristotle\u2019s Categories, was another important\nsource, especially as his discussion allowed commentators to relate\nlinguistic problems to metaphysical problems concerning the nature of\nthe individual named by a singular term. Commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories discussed singular terms as examples of equivocal\nterms, those having more than one sense. Later in the Middle Ages and\nat the beginning of the sixteenth century, singular terms were\ndiscussed in treatises devoted to types of terms. Paul of Venice\u2019s\ntreatise is worthy of special mention here, despite the difficulty of\nconstruing many of his claims.  Because the use of singular terms was\ntied to singular concepts, they were also discussed in commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics, De anima, and\nMetaphysics. The commentaries of John Buridan (d. after 1358)\nprovide the richest and most coherent medieval theory, and one which\nremained influential into the sixteenth century. During the sixteenth\ncentury, singular concepts remained a subject of discussion in\ncommentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Physics and De anima, but\nunfortunately the logicians who came after Domingo de Soto (1494\u20131560)\nreverted to a very cursory treatment of singular terms. We have to\nwait for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for a rediscovery of\nsome of the problems that had exercised John Buridan in the fourteenth\ncentury. \n", "toc": [{"#SigCon": "1.

Signification and Concepts\n\n\nIn order to understand medieval theories of singular terms, we need to\nconsider medieval semantics, and why the question of singular terms\nwas so closely linked to the issue of singular concepts. \n\n\nThe central semantic notion for medieval authors was that of\nsignification, which must not be identified with the notion of meaning\nfor two reasons. First, the meaning of a term is not an entity to\nwhich the term is related in some way, but one can say that an\nutterance signifies or makes known an entity, whether conceptual or\nreal, universal or particular. Moreover, meaning is not transitive,\nbut signification is. A spoken word was said to be a conventional sign\nof a concept, which in turn, at least for later authors, was a natural\nsign of a thing, and so spoken words were said to be at least indirect\nsigns of things. This is not to deny that medieval thinkers had a\ngeneral notion of meaning. They did talk about sense (sensus),\nabout the thought or content (sententia) of a phrase, and about\nthe force of a word (vis verbi), and they often used the word\n\u2018significatio\u2019 itself along with its cognates quite\nwidely.  When they were discussing indexicals, especially personal\npronouns and demonstratives, they drew a distinction between a term\u2019s\ngeneral signification or what Kaplan has called\n\u2018character\u2019 and its particular signification, that is, its\n\u2018content\u2019 or contribution to what is actually said on a\nparticular occasion of use.\n\n\nIf we take signification in a narrow sense, as a technical notion, we\nfind that there were two not entirely compatible approaches, each\nbased on a sentence from Aristotle, and each emphasizing the role of\nconcepts, whether the hearer\u2019s or the speaker\u2019s. According to the\nfirst approach, based on De interpretatione 16b19\u201321, to\nsignify is to generate or establish an understanding. This definition\nplaces emphasis not on the speaker, but on the hearer. So long as the\nhearer can acquire some understanding through hearing, the utterance\nis significant even if the speaker is incapable of rational, abstract,\nthought, and even if the speaker has no intention of conveying a\nmessage. The second and most influential approach tied the\nsignificative power of an utterance to its making known a concept. The\ncrucial text here is De interpretatione 16a3\u20134, read as saying,\n\u201cSpoken words are signs of concepts.\u201d This supports the\nview that it is the speaker\u2019s intellectual capacity and intentions\nthat are crucial to significant utterance.\n\n\nAristotle, as interpreted by medieval commentators, had gone on to say\nthat concepts were similitudes or signs of things, and this raised the\nquestion of what is meant by \u2018thing\u2019. In other words, what\nis it that we understand when an utterance such as \u2018man\u2019\nor \u2018animal\u2019 establishes an understanding? The usual\nassumption from Boethius at least until the end of the thirteenth\ncentury was that the understanding is of some kind of universal, an\nessence or common nature, and when logicians asked whether spoken\nwords primarily signified concepts or things, the issue was whether\nconcepts or common natures should be taken as the primary significates\nof an utterance. If the concept was said to be the primary\nsignificate, then the common nature was the secondary significate. If\nthe common nature was said to be the primary significate, then\nindividuals having that nature were often said to be the secondary\nsignificates.  The issue was complicated by various views about the\nnature of concepts as opposed to intelligible species, and about the\nstatus of common natures, and their precise relation to individuals,\nbut fortunately these details do not concern us here. So long as\ncommon natures in some sense played a role in the signification of\ncommon nouns, there was a strong temptation to speak as if there are\nindividual natures which play a similar role in the signification of\nsingular terms. From Boethius on, there are many references to\nindividual forms, and such terms as Socrateity (Socrateitas)\nand Platonicity (Platonitas) were frequently used, even by\nThomas Aquinas. On the other hand, the Aristotelian insistence, taken\nup by Aquinas in particular, that the intellect cannot grasp\nindividuals as such made the explanation of how we can understand\nSocrates more complicated. There did not seem to be a concept of\nSocrateity that corresponded to the form spoken of. Moreover, the very\nnotion of an individual nature seemed incompatible with\nAristotelianism. As a result, some thinkers in the second half of the\nthirteenth century held that what the grammarian counts as a proper\nname is not properly a name, since it does not signify a common\nnature.\n The issue of individual natures also affected the way in which the\nnewly developed theory of supposition was presented, since it\nemphasised the fact that terms could exhibit a variety of semantic\nfeatures. Thus one and the same term could have material supposition\nwhen it referred to the actual word, as in \u201c\u2018man\u2019\nhas three letters,\u201d or simple supposition when it referred to\nthe form signified, as in \u201cMan is a species of animal,\u201d or\npersonal supposition when it referred to individuals, as in\n\u201cSome man is running.\u201d Certainly singular terms could have\nmaterial supposition, but, at least for non-nominalists, the\ndistinction between simple or formal supposition and personal\nsupposition was more problematic. Either singular terms lacked a\nsemantic property that common nouns had, or singular terms could stand\nfor an individual nature. William of Sherwood explicitly allowed the\nsingular term \u2018Socrates\u2019 to have formal supposition in the\nsentence \u201cSocrates is said of just one individual\u201d, on the\ngrounds that \u2018Socrates\u2019 does signify a form, but he went\non to deny that the term had the further property of appellation,\nwhich belonged to predicates, because, unlike common nouns, it could\nnot properly function as a predicate. However, other\nthirteenth-century logicians tended to by-pass the problem of whether\nwhat they took to be fundamental semantic features all applied equally\nto both singular terms and common nouns.\n\n\nThis general problem of semantic variation remains in the background,\nsince many features other than simple supposition were attributed to\nterms, but the nature of the debate about concepts and things was to\nchange completely in the fourteenth century, first with the insistence\nof John Duns Scotus, like others before him, that individuals can be\ngrasped by the intellect, but more especially with the rise of\nnominalism, according to which all that exists are individual things,\nand that only concepts can be common or universal. The question\nwhether words primarily signify concepts or things was now construed\nas the question: does a word signify an individual thing in the world\ndirectly, or does it signify first the concept which is a necessary\ncondition for signification? John Buridan and his near contemporary\nWilliam Ockham differed on this issue. Buridan held that words first\nsignify concepts, because only then can we explain why terms such as\n\u2018being\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019 which have the same\nextension nonetheless differ in signification. Ockham preferred to say\nthat words signify only individual things and are subordinated to\nconcepts without signifying them. Both thinkers are noteworthy for\ntheir insistence that the concept itself was a sign which plays a\ncrucial intermediary role in language production and understanding and\nthat concepts are the terms of a fully-fledged mental language.\nMoreover, the concept as sign was defined as a formal representation\nof its object. However one construes the notion of representation here\n(and any crude pictorial theory can be ruled out), it is clear that\nconceptual representation was taken to involve some level of\ngenerality, and so there is an obvious problem where singular concepts\nare concerned. Yet, given John Buridan\u2019s claim that a spoken term\ncannot be called universal or singular unless it corresponds to a\nuniversal or singular concept, we must have singular concepts if we\nhave any genuine singular terms. As we shall see in \u00a79, Buridan\nintroduces an extra condition for the singular concept, while allowing\nit to have a certain kind of generality.\n\n\nConcepts were said to signify naturally, and to have the same\nsignification for all thinkers, or at least all thinkers with the same\nexperience, but spoken terms, and the written terms which were\nsubordinated to them, were thought to acquire their signification by\nsome original act of imposition. While most authors were careful not\nto commit themselves to any account of how this original imposition\nactually occurs, and while it was recognized that words such as\n\u2018person\u2019 and \u2018spirit\u2019 (both important in\ntheological contexts) do acquire new connotations, it was generally\nsupposed that the signification of common nouns within a given\nconventional language remains stable. Proper names were both easier\nand more difficult to account for. They were\nmore difficult because it is not entirely plausible to account for the\nstability of their signification by appeal to standard\ndefinitions. They were easier because there are\neasily ascertainable instances of original imposition, particularly\nthrough Christian baptism, though Paul of Venice explicitly recognized\nthat non-Christians have equivalent name-giving ceremonies. \n\n\nMedieval logicians insisted that original imposition had to be carried\nout by someone (or some group) with special authority, and this\nproduced some puzzles about our use of proper names. If the word\n\u2018lion\u2019 signifies a particular species of animal, then we\ncan say that lions are always lions, but is Mary always Mary? Buridan\ndevoted one of the sophisms in his Summulae de Dialectica to\nthe question of whether one can truly say \u201cBa will be\nbaptized\u201d (where \u2018ba\u2019 was deliberately chosen as a\nnonsense syllable), given that \u2018ba\u2019 does not signify a boy\nbefore his baptism takes place. He concluded that the sentence in\nquestion had no truth-value, though both \u201c\u2018This boy is\nba\u2019 will be true tomorrow\u201d and \u201cThis boy will be\ncalled \u2018ba\u2019\u201d could be true. Paul of Venice asked\nwhat would happen if, after being baptized \u2018Socrates\u2019, a\nperson was consistently called \u2018Plato\u2019 by a whole\ncommunity, and even forgot his original name. Paul thought that the\nperson would still be Socrates, since only the original baptism\ninvolved the appropriate authority. On the other hand, legitimate\nchanges were possible, as when a newly elected pope takes on a new\nname. As a result of these various remarks, it seems that Mary is not\nMary before she is named, and she can cease to be Mary if she is given\na new name by someone with authority.\n2. Porphyry\u2019s Classification of Singular Terms\n\n\nDiscussions of singular terms were frequently related to a passage\nfrom Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge. In the version used by medieval\nlogicians, Porphyry writes: \u201cIndividual is said of one\nparticular alone. Socrates is said to be individual, and this white\n<thing>, and this approaching <person>, and son of\nSophroniscus, if Socrates be his only son. Such things are said to be\nindividuals, since each of them consists of properties whose\ncollection will never be the same in another.\u201d \n\n\nThe last sentence of Porphyry\u2019s text ties the ontological notion of an\nindividual to a collection of properties, and as a corollary, it can\nbe taken to tie the notion of an individual term to a descriptive\nphrase. However, there was fairly general agreement that a collection\nof properties could not constitute an individual, and there seems to\nhave been no attempt to make the description of these properties into\na definition of the individual, or to see them as providing the\nprimary signification of singular terms. In the twelfth century,\nAbelard pointed out at some length in his Dialectica that\nSocrates is the name of an individual substance and that the accidents\nassociated with him by some description cannot enter into the\nimposition of the signification of the name, else the name would be\nequivocal through time. Socrates was called Socrates before he became\na poet (or musician) and after he ceased to be the son of Sophroniscus\n(presumably by the latter\u2019s death).  The notion that one could define\nan individual by giving a list of common properties was also ruled out\nby Priscian\u2019s account of names (see \u00a74), and the resulting\ndistinction between primary and secondary signification.\n\n\nThe main part of Porphyry\u2019s text offered medieval logicians the basis\nfor a classification of three types of singular term. First, there is\nthe determinate individual, represented by the proper name\n\u2018Socrates\u2019. Everyone realized that different people could\nhave the same name, but it is important to note that\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 said of two different people was a standard\nexample of an equivocal term, a word with two unrelated significations\n(see \u00a75). For each individual named \u2018Socrates\u2019, there\nhad to be a specific semantic convention associating that individual\nwith that name-type. John Buridan remarked that even if there were a\nthousand other people called John, all entirely similar to him, the\nname \u2018John\u2019 as bestowed on Buridan would signify only\nBuridan and no one else. \n\n\nThe second type of singular term is the vague individual\n(individuum vagum), represented by the phrases \u2018this\nwhite <thing>\u2019 and \u2018this approaching\n<person>\u2019. In other contexts, especially commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Categories 2a11\u201313, the vague individual was\nrepresented by such phrases as \u2018some man\u2019, but in all the\ntexts we are concerned with, the presence of the demonstrative pronoun\nis crucial. The word \u2018vague\u2019 is used partly because the\nsame phrase will have a different reference when uttered in different\ncontexts, but mainly because the identification of the individual in\nquestion is indeterminate, though to a varying extent. \u2018This\nbeing\u2019 and \u2018this body\u2019 are highly indeterminate,\n\u2018this animal\u2019 is less indeterminate, and \u2018this\nman\u2019 is even less indeterminate, but it still lacks the\nprecision of \u2018Socrates\u2019. I can recognize someone as a man\nwithout being able to distinguish him from other men in any reliable\nmanner. As we shall see below (\u00a79), Buridan took the vague\nsingular to be the most proper type of singular term.\n\n\nFinally, we have the individual by supposition (ex\nsuppositione) or by circumlocution (circumlocutione),\nrepresented by the phrase \u2018son of Sophroniscus\u2019 . Some\npeople distinguished two cases here. For John Versor, a\nfifteenth-century thinker, \u2018son of Sophroniscus\u2019 is\ndeterminate by virtue of supposition, but \u2018man with a fat head,\na long nose and so on\u2019 is determinate by virtue of\ncircumlocution. In works which did not comment on Porphyry directly,\nthe third type was often omitted, and there was agreement that\nalthough the phrases involved are referring expressions and may in\nfact refer to just one thing, they are not properly speaking singular\nterms. Just as some common terms, such as \u2018sun\u2019 and\n\u2018moon\u2019, in fact have only one referent, so there are\nreferring phrases which in fact have only one referent, but do not\ncount as singular terms because by the mode of their signification\nthey could supposit for more than one thing. \n\n\nWe should note that in the context of Porphyry\u2019s discussion, we are\ndealing with indefinite descriptions, given that the stipulation that\nSophroniscus has only one son is not part of the phrase but merely\nbackground information.  This fact is enough to ensure that the phrase\nin fact refers to only one individual, but it does not alter the\nlinguistic generality of the phrase.  There was little specific\ndiscussion of definite descriptions, but it seems that they would have\nbeen treated in the same way. John Buridan has the most direct\ndiscussion of the issue. In one place he considers the phrase,\n\u2018first Christian king of France\u2019 (primus rex Francie\nchristianus).  This he took to be general, insofar as it is made\nup of common concepts.  In another place he considers the phrase\n\u2018largest and brightest heavenly body\u2019 (planeta maximus\net lucidissimus) used to refer to the sun, and he remarks that the\nvery same phrase, without any new imposition, could supposit for a\nsecond sun if God were to create another, either similar or greater in\nsize and brightness.  He could be interpreted as saying that the very\nsame phrase, without being given any new signification, could refer to\ndifferent individuals in different possible worlds.\n3. Other Types of Singular Term\n\n\nPorphyry\u2019s divisions by no means exhausted the types of term and\nphrase that could be regarded as singular. For those who accepted\nsimple supposition as supposition for a common nature, \u201cMan is a\nspecies\u201d had a singular subject. Later nominalists regarded the\nsame sentence as indefinite, on the grounds that \u2018man\u2019 had\nmaterial supposition and could refer either to itself or to its\nequiforms. Indeed, any term whatsoever could be taken as having\nmaterial supposition for itself or its equiforms, or as having\npersonal supposition, and in early sixteenth-century Parisian logic\ntexts it was normal to remark that all singular terms are common, and\nall common terms are singular when taken in these different\nways. Collective terms of one sort and another were included under the\nheading of singular terms. \u2018These\u2019 in \u201cThese are\nrunning,\u201d \u2018all God\u2019s apostles\u2019 in \u201cAll God\u2019s\napostles are twelve <in number>,\u201d \u2018Rome\u2019, and\n\u2018Salamanca\u2019 are examples. Phrases containing a mixture of\nsingular and common terms, such as \u2018the being which is\nSocrates\u2019, were also counted as singular. Other phrases\ncontaining mixtures of singular and common terms together with logical\nconnectives were the subject of many rules and lengthy discussions\nfrom the late fourteenth century onward. Thus we discover that\n\u2018Socrates or Plato\u2019 is a common term because it can be\nverified of more than one thing while \u2018Socrates and Plato\u2019\nis a collective singular term. On the other hand, if we write\n\u2018Socrates and a donkey\u2019, the phrase is common because it\ncontains a common term as an equally principal part. This feature\ndistinguishes it from aggregates in which the singular term determines\nthe common term, as in \u2018the substance John\u2019 and \u2018the\nman Socrates\u2019.\n4. Proper Names\n\n\nThe Stoics had made a clear distinction between proper names and\ncommon nouns, listing them as different parts of speech, but while\nthis possibility was recognized by Priscian and the influential\ntwelfth century grammarian, Peter Helias, it was not adopted.\nAccording to Priscian, the nomen, the noun or name, is the\nfirst of the principal parts of speech, and it signifies substance\nwith quality, that is, it signifies a thing of a certain sort, or an\nindividual established in a certain nature. The nomen is\ndivided into the common or appellative name and the proper name. \nBecause the proper name is a subdivision of the name, and hence a\nfully-fledged part of the language, it is taken to have the same\nsemantic properties as the common name, and it can, indeed must, be\ntaken to have a sense. According to Priscian, the proper name\nsignifies a particular substance and its quality, and it may also\ninclude the apprehension of something common. Thus if I say\n\u2018Virgil\u2019, the common notions \u2018man\u2019 and\n\u2018poet\u2019 will be understood. Hence there are two kinds of\nsenses attached to proper names, a particular sense which cannot be\nexpressed by common notions, and an associated sense, a\ndescription.\n\n\nThere are four types of proper name according to Priscian, the\nEncyclopedist Isidore of Seville, and medieval grammarians, namely\npraenomen, nomen, cognomen, and\nagnomen. For Isidore of Seville, the nomen was the\nname of the gens or clan, a group of people with a common\nancestor, but for Priscian, Peter Helias and the modistic grammarians,\nsuch as Thomas of Erfurt, the nomen was the most properly\nproper name, that which signified an individual \u201cin an absolute\nway under the properties which gave him his individuality\u201d as\nThomas put it. The praenomen distinguished between people of\nthe same family. The cognomen was the family name, and the\nagnomen was a name, such as \u2018Africanus\u2019, given in\nhonour of some achievement, especially military. Peter Helias asked\nwhether the four types of name had the same signification, and whether\nthe cognomen was a common noun. In his reply, he made an\nexplicit distinction between a principal signification which is unique\nand a secondary signification. The cognomen principally\nsignifies an individual quality, but secondarily signifies the common\nquality of belonging to a certain family group. He added that this\ndistinction applied to all four types of proper name, and so they all\nhave the same principal signification when used of one person. This\nreinforces the claim that proper names are not equivalent to a set of\ncommon characteristics, and cannot be defined. \n5. Synonymy, Metaphor, and Equivocation \n\n\nProper names were allowed to exhibit the features of common nouns in\nvarious respects.  For instance, they could be used\nmetaphorically. Aquinas mentions the use of \u2018Achilles\u2019 to\nrefer to strong men, and others used \u2018Nero\u2019 as an example\nof cruel men. More importantly, \u2018Marcus\u2019 and\n\u2018Tullius\u2019, as two names of the Roman orator Marcus Tullius\nCicero, were favourite examples of synonymous terms.  As such they\nfeatured in discussions of the problem of intentional contexts.  The\nearly thirteenth century theologian Praepositinus of Cremona discussed\nthe relation between the speaker\u2019s understanding and the signification\nof a proposition in the situation where a man knows Marcus, but does\nnot know that he is also called Tullius, and hence believes that the\nsentence \u201cHe is Tullius\u201d (said by someone pointing to\nMarcus Tullius) is false. A century later Walter Burley asked whether\none could infer that a person knows that Tullius is running, given\nthat he knows that Marcus is running, and given that Marcus is\nTullius.\n\n\nThe most interesting issues arise in the context of equivocal\nterms. These were divided into two kinds, chance equivocals, and\ndeliberate equivocals. In the first case, the occurrences of the\nequivocal term were totally unconnected, but in the second case, some\nintention on the part of the speakers was involved, and the\noccurrences of the equivocal term could be related in various\nways. From classical times onward, proper names such as\n\u2018Ajax\u2019 and \u2018Alexander\u2019 provided standard\nexamples of equivocal terms. However, it was obvious that there were\nreasons for giving one proper name rather than another, and Aquinas,\nfor instance, gave an elaborate list of such reasons. This suggested\nto at least some authors that proper names need not be regarded as\nchance equivocals. In his commentary on the Categories, Paul of\nVenice claimed that some names were purely equivocal, and he instanced\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 and \u2018Plato\u2019. However, if several\nmen were called John because they were born on the Feast of St. John,\nthe name \u2018John\u2019 should be regarded as a univocal term. He\noverlooked the distinction made by his contemporary, John Dorp,\nbetween a common reason for giving the same name to two children, and\nthe different singular concepts which that name signified. Dorp argued\nthat a common reason was not enough for univocity. In the sixteenth\ncentury, Domingo de Soto used the newly-rediscovered commentary on the\nCategories by Philoponus (attributed wrongly to Ammonius) to\nintroduce a new type of deliberate equivocal, \u2018from hope and\nmemory\u2019. One might call one\u2019s son Plato in the hope of his\nbecoming a philosopher, or Nicomachus in memory of one\u2019s father or\nCharles in honour of the Emperor.\n\n\nWhile almost everyone except Paul of Venice agreed that proper names\nmust always be equivocal when used of two different people, not\neveryone wanted to say that they were univocal when used of the same\nperson. Except for Roger Bacon, who thought of proper names as\nconstantly receiving new impositions (see \u00a77), the reason had to\ndo with the definition of a univocal term as involving a concept or a\nnature predicable, at least in principle, of several individuals.  The\nusual solution was simply to redefine \u2018univocal\u2019 so that\nproper names were included, but the Categories commentaries of\nAlbert of Saxony, Marsilius of Inghen and Paul of Venice contain\nfairly extensive discussions of the issue. Both Albert and Paul agreed\nin opposition to Marsilius that a proper name could be equivocal\nwithout being called univocal when used of one person.\n\n\nAn issue to do with the grammatical properties of proper names was\nwhether they could be pluralized or quantified. Most people said that\nno plural could be grammatically correct, and that such phrases as\n\u2018every Socrates\u2019 were ill-formed, but various logicians in\nlate fourteenth-century Oxford pointed out that such locutions as\n\u201cThere are several Roberts\u201d or \u2018every William\u2019\nhad their uses in ordinary speech, even if they were somewhat\ndeviant. The use of demonstratives with proper names could also pose a\nproblem. Domingo de Soto remarked that in the case where there are\nseveral people called Peter in the room, and we want to distinguish\nthis Peter from that Peter we may speak of this or that Peter, but in\nthe mind, where there are no equivocal concepts, the singular concept\ncorresponding to a proper name cannot properly be further\nsingularized, any more than it can be universalized.\n6. Demonstrative Pronouns\n\n\nPriscian made a strong connection between the proper name and the\npronoun (pronomen), saying that the pronoun is taken in place\nof a proper name. It also has a kind of primacy over the proper\nname. As Priscian said, even if we know that Virgil is a man and a\npoet, we won\u2019t be able to identify him (assuming we are in his\npresence) unless someone says \u201cThis is Virgil.\u201d  The type\nof pronoun we are interested in here is what medieval grammarians\ncalled the primitive (non-derived) demonstrative pronoun, which\nincludes personal pronouns such as \u2018I\u2019 and demonstratives\nsuch as \u2018this\u2019. Demonstration (construed as\n\u2018pointing to\u2019) can be either direct, when something is\nbefore one\u2019s eyes, or intellectual, or a mixture of the two.  Leaving\naside intellectual demonstration, which occurs when an object is\nincorporeal or absent (see \u00a78), we can note that the use of a\ndemonstrative pronoun in normal circumstances has the implication that\nthe object pointed to must be present to the speaker.\n\n\nThe standard case is represented by \u2018this\u2019 or by\n\u2018this man\u2019, and the mental correlate in both cases is a\ncommon concept singularized by a demonstrative act. Because\n\u2018this\u2019 is tied to particular demonstrative acts, Buridan,\nlike many other logicians in the fourteenth, fifteenth and early\nsixteenth centuries, took it that genuine referring uses of the phrase\n\u2018this man\u2019 are equivocal. What I signify when I say\n\u2018this man\u2019 pointing to Socrates is quite different from\nwhat you signify when you say \u2018this man\u2019 pointing to\nPlato, and every use of the phrase requires a new imposition.  As Soto\npointed out, this is quite compatible with the claim that \u2018this\nman\u2019 has an unchanging general sense which is understood by all\nspeakers of Latin.  It is also compatible with failures of reference\nof various sorts, as Buridan and others frequently remarked. I can say\n\u2018this man\u2019 and point to a donkey, or to\nnothing. Similarly, I can utter \u2018this chimera\u2019, a phrase\nwhich can never have a referent, given that chimeras are impossible\nobjects.\n\n\nOne might suppose that mere pointing is all that a demonstrative\npronoun does, and certainly Priscian had claimed that while the name\nsignifies substance with quality, that is, a referent plus its nature,\nthe pronoun signifies substance without quality, that is, a bare\nreferent (cf. \u00a78).  However, medieval grammarians and logicians\ntended to demand some identification of the object denoted. One\ncontext for the demand is found in the discussion of constructions\nmixing first-person pronouns and first-person verb forms with proper\nnames, which were counted as third-personal. Priscian took such\nlocutions as \u201cPriscian read\u201d (Priscianus lego) to\nbe ill-formed, and preferred the expansion, \u201cI Priscian\nread\u201d (Ego Priscianus lego). In his discussion of this\nsentence, Peter Helias placed the emphasis on the presence of\n\u2018I\u2019. He explained that \u201cI\u201d cannot pick out a\nform, so \u2018Priscian\u2019 has to be supplied in order for there\nto be a perfect subject. Nearly two and a half centuries later John\nDorp appealed to the same grammatical doctrine in order to explain\nthat the sense of the spoken phrase \u201cI run\u201d is either\n\u201cI John run\u201d or \u201cI, a man, run.\u201d The mental\ncorrelate of a personal pronoun must involve an identifying concept,\nwhether singular or universal.\n\n\nFor Dorp and other later logicians ordinary demonstrative pronouns\nsuch as \u2018this\u2019 similarly require the presence of an\nidentifying concept. This raised the issue of what in the mind\ncorresponds to the pronoun itself, an issue which relates to the more\ngeneral issue of the mental correlate of syncategorematic terms, that\nis, terms which perform some logical function, as opposed to\ncategorematic terms, or terms such as nouns and adjectives, which fall\nunder Aristotle\u2019s categories. Some people apparently held that there\nare no pronouns in the mind.  Hence one can argue that a demonstrative\npronoun is a disguised categorematic term, and that the mental\ncorrelate of \u201cThis man runs\u201d is \u201cThe man Socrates\nruns.\u201d On the more common view, pronouns are subordinated to\nspecial demonstrative or relative acts in the mind. If the pronoun is\njoined to a noun in the spoken phrase, then it represents a purely\nsyncategorematic act in the mind. If it appears alone in the spoken\nphrase, there are two possibilities, as John Dorp argued. It can be\ntaken to be subordinated to a mental phrase containing both a\nsyncategorematic act and a name, and this case would be\nlegitimate. Alternatively, it could be taken as purely\nsyncategorematic, and this use would be illegitimate, because there\nwould be no sign of the thing pointed to, and a purely\nsyncategorematic term cannot be the subject of a proposition. You\ncannot successfully think \u201cThis is running\u201d without\nidentifying the \u2018this\u2019 in some way.  However, it seems\nthat the identification need not involve a sortal concept. A singular\nconcept is enough. \n7. Singular Terms in Logic\n\n\nThe use of singular terms in inferences raised various issues. So far\nas syllogistic was concerned, some logicians, such as Lambert of\nAuxerre (or Lagny) gave a standard account of the Aristotelian\nsyllogism which is centered on the universal and particular\nquantification of general terms at the same time as they gave examples\nwith singular terms, such as \u201cEvery man is an animal, Socrates\nis a man, therefore Socrates is an animal.\u201d More detailed\npresentations of syllogistic included an account of the expository\nsyllogism, which is in the third figure and has a singular middle\nterm, and of other syllogisms with singular terms. Such syllogisms\nwere said to be governed by the two principles \u201cWhen two things\nare the same as a third, they are the same as each other\u201d and\n\u201cWhen one of two things is the same as a third and one is not,\nthen the two things are not the same as each other.\u201d The\nexistence of syllogisms with singular terms could be thought to cast\ndoubt on such general syllogistic principles as \u201cOne premise\nmust always be universal\u201d and \u201cNothing follows from two\nparticular premises.\u201d Lambert dealt with the former problem by\nappealing to the formulation \u201cEverything that is Socrates runs,\nSocrates is a man, therefore a man runs.\u201d Buridan preferred to\nreject the first principle, and John Dorp explained that the second\nprinciple did not apply unless one specified that\n\u2018particular\u2019 was used in the narrow sense of\n\u2018neither universal nor singular\u2019. In the seventeenth\ncentury, some logicians were to treat singular propositions as\nequivalent to universal propositions, but, as Dorp\u2019s remarks suggest,\nmedieval logicians preferred to class singular propositions with\nparticular propositions.\n\n\nAnother place in which singular terms were used was suppositional\ndescent, as when one infers from \u201cEvery man is running\u201d\nthat Socrates is running or Plato is running or Cicero is running, or that\nthis man is running, and that man is running. In the earlier Middle\nAges, logicians did not seem to worry about the use of proper names as\nopposed to demonstrative phrases, but there was some discussion of\npossible problems in the later period. One problem had to do with the\nfact that there are different types of singular name. Men are called\nSocrates, Plato and Cicero, but donkeys are called Brownie\n(Brunellus), Tawny (Favellus) and Little Grey\n(Grisellus), so what happens if someone produces the inference,\n\u201cEvery man is running, therefore Brownie is running and Tawny is\nrunning\u201d? After all, this inference has exactly the same logical\nform as \u201cEvery man is running, therefore Socrates is running and\nPlato is running.\u201d Moreover, even if one has the correct type of\nproper name, its bearer may die, rendering the conclusion false while\nthe premise remains true. If one adopts the preferred solution of\nreplacing proper names by demonstrative phrases, a similar problem\narises. If \u2018this\u2019 does not succeed in pointing to a living\nman, then \u201cEvery man is running, therefore this man is\nrunning\u201d may have a true premise and a false conclusion. The\nproblem was dealt with by the provision of extra premises which\nensured that the very same things referred to by a true premise are\nthe things referred to by the demonstrative phrases in the\nconclusion.\n\n\nThe problem of reference to dead men was also discussed by\nlogicians. There were three issues. First, there was the problem of\nwords used of a living man and of a corpse. Following Aristotle\n(Meteorology 389b31), and also Augustine\u2019s On Dialectic,\nlogicians were content to accept that if I point to a corpse and say\n\u201cThis is a man\u201d or \u201cThis is Peter,\u201d then\n\u2018man\u2019 and \u2018Peter\u2019 are being used equivocally,\nin some different or extended sense.  Second, there was the problem of\nestablishing a referent for such claims as \u201cAdam was in\nParadise\u201d or \u201cAdam is dead.\u201d Here supposition theory\ncame into play, for it allowed reference to past objects as well as\npresent objects, future objects, and possible objects. Third, there\nwas the problem which was the focus of special attention in the second\nhalf of the thirteenth century, namely whether the proposition\n\u201cCaesar is a man\u201d can be true when Caesar is dead. This\nquestion had to do in large part with the interpretation of\n\u2018is\u2019, but what concerns us here is the related issue of\nwhether proper names lost their signification when their bearer\ndied. If they do, it seems that any discussion of the past will be\nsenseless. The answers given show the particular importance of the\nplace of the mind in signification.  For instance, Boethius of Dacia\nwrote \u201cafter Socrates\u2019s destruction \u2018Socrates\u2019\nsignifies such a being as Socrates once was\u2026when the\nreal thing has been destroyed, conceiving of that thing is possible\nfor the intellect as it was earlier; for it is possible to think the\nthing after its destruction. Therefore, it is also possible to signify\nthe thing by means of an utterance as it was earlier.\u201d An\nopposing view was presented by Roger Bacon, who held that proper names\nwere radically equivocal because they were subject to constant\nreimposition. The person who cries out \u201cJohn is dead,\u201d\nintending to refer either to a thing of the past or to a corpse, has\ngiven a new imposition to the word \u2018John\u2019, even if his\ngrief prevents him from realizing this.\n\n\nOne issue that did not arise is that of fictional names. Medieval\nlogicians were concerned with problems of reference to dead persons,\nor to fictional entities such as chimeras or the phoenix, but I have\nyet to come across any discussion of fictional singular terms such as\nFrodo Baggins or Harry Potter. Buridan remarked that one might acquire\nfictitious singular concepts in dreams, but he did not speak of naming\ntheir non-existent objects. Perhaps the nearest anyone came to raising\nthe problem of fictional names was hinted at in an early\nfifteenth-century discussion by Nicholas of Amsterdam. He mentioned\nthe problem of Antichrist, who is named, though he does not yet\nexist. The solution depended on the claims that signification involves\nan aptitude, and that since Antichrist would exist in the future, he\nwould then give rise to a genuine singular concept \n8. Singular Terms in Theology \n\n\nProblems of naming often arose in theological contexts, and Aquinas\u2019s\nown list of reasons for giving proper names is part of his discussion\nof whether Christ was appropriately named \u2018Jesus\u2019.  The\nword \u2018God\u2019 was the focus of particular\nattention. Praepositinus of Cremona said that properly speaking it was\nneither a proper name nor a common term, while other early theologians\napparently suggested that it was a proper name, because it referred to\na reality that could only be singular. The majority view was expressed\nby Aquinas, who argued that the word \u2018God\u2019 was much like\nthe word \u2018sun\u2019. We know that this word has only one\nreferent, and in the case of God, we know that the word can\nhave only one referent; nonetheless, \u2018God\u2019 is a common\nterm. In many later logicians \u2018God\u2019 appears along with\n\u2018sun\u2019 and \u2018moon\u2019 as an example of words that\nare not singular terms, despite the fact that they supposit for only\none thing.\n\n\nThe Trinity caused particular problems for logicians because of the\nunique relation between the three persons and the one divine essence\nwhich is, as Ockham put it in his Summa logicae, \u201cone and\nsimple and one in number and singular to the highest degree, and yet\nis several things.\u201d Such inferences as \u201cThis divine\nessence is the Father, this divine essence is the Son, therefore the\nFather is the Son\u201d seem to have true premises which assert an\nidentity between singular things, yet the conclusion is\nunacceptable. Various solutions were found, including an exploration\nof different senses of identity and of different types of\npredication. In his Perutilis logica Albert of Saxony\nsuggested that in expository syllogisms the middle term should always\nbe qualified by the phrase, \u201cEverything which is,\u201d which\nmakes the premises false in the divine case. In the Summa\nlogicae, Ockham preferred to say that a singular proposition of\nthe sort required for expository syllogisms could not have a subject\nwhich supposited for a reality that was both one and many, as occurs\nin the Trinitarian example.\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic doctrine of transsubstantiation led to a discussion\nof demonstrative phrases. When during the Eucharist the priest takes\nthe bread and utters the words \u201cThis is my body,\u201d the\nsubstance is said to change from bread into the body of Christ. What\nthen is the referent of the word \u2018this\u2019? It cannot be the\nbread, for that would falsify the sentence, but it cannot be the body\nof Christ, for the change of substance only occurs when the utterance\nis complete. In their solutions, theologians discussed a wide range of\ntopics, including the relation between the use and mention of a\nproposition, the relation of a proposition to the stretch of time\nduring which it is uttered, and the difference between factual and\nperformative utterances, but what concerns us here is their treatment\nof the word \u2018this\u2019. Priscian\u2019s reference to intellectual\ndemonstration was found useful, and the thought that a demonstrative\ncould refer either to something absent or to something spiritual was\nsupplemented by a further kind of intellectual demonstration in which\nthe thing actually pointed to is not numerically identical to the\nthing signified and to which the predicate applies. \u201cThis herb\ngrows in my garden,\u201d said while in someone else\u2019s garden, was\nthe standard example here. Aquinas seized on Priscian\u2019s further claim\nthat demonstratives signify substance without quality, and argued that\n\u2018this\u2019 refers to something indeterminate which is first\nqualified by the properties of bread and then by the properties of\nChrist\u2019s body. \n9. Buridan\u2019s Theory of Singular Terms\n \n\nJohn Buridan was the medieval author who produced the fullest and most\ncoherent account of singular terms. In his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nDe anima, Buridan claims that the vague individual is the most\nproper singular term. While it is true that the phrase \u2018this\nman\u2019 can lack reference through improper use, if it is used\nproperly it must point to one united existent present object, the very\nsituation in which we form genuinely singular concepts. Demonstrative\nphrases are so clearly tied to the here-and-now that no problem of\nidentity through time can arise. On the other hand, this allows for\nonly a very time-bound usage. In his consideration of whether the\nsingular term \u2018Socrates\u2019 could be defined by the phrase\n\u2018this man\u2019, Buridan remarked that if Socrates leaves the\nroom, he is still Socrates, but he is no longer the referent of\n\u2018this man\u2019. \n\n\nBuridan\u2019s view of vague individuals was related to his discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s claim (Physics 1 184a22\u201324) that we must proceed\nfrom universals to particulars. On the one hand, he insisted that\ncognition can only begin when a singular thing is present to the\nsenses; on the other hand, he argued that our cognition must move from\nthe more general to the less general, because it requires more skill\nto grasp the less general. Adults, he remarked, distinguish easily\nbetween dogs and cats, but small children do not.  Instead of\nsupposing that the only appropriate singular is Socrates, Buridan\nargued that for each level of generality, there is an appropriate\nvague singular. First we cognize this body, then we cognize this\nanimal, and then we cognize this man.  This account of the standard\nprogression allows recognition both of the primacy of singulars, and\nof the move from more to less general. It depends on Buridan\u2019s\nepistemological claim that general notions are always involved in\napprehension, and that what makes an apprehension singular is the\n\u2018confusion\u2019 or fusing together of circumstances, so that\nbeing a man is not abstracted from being here and now in such and such\na way. Singularity is not tied to the absence of generality, but to\nthe presence of \u2018confusion\u2019 or the lack of\ndiscrimination. In other words, a concept can be semantically simple\nor singular while being metaphysically rich. It has a complex content\nwithout being compositional, and without the elements having been\ndistinguished from one another.\n\n\nJohn Dorp recognized that Buridan\u2019s account depends on the claim that\nwe can grasp generality directly, and that what makes a concept\nsingular is not the absence of generality but the fact that the\ngeneral has not yet been separated from the set of particular\ncircumstances. Dorp rejected this account, and argued that we have no\nsuch singular term as a vague individual in our language. To cognize a\nthing as singular must involve cognition of particular circumstances,\nand the general concept \u2018man\u2019 cannot be part of the\nsingular cognition. If we want to introduce vague singulars into our\nlanguage, we will have to invent some special term, such as\n\u2018a\u2019, to signify Socrates together with a connotation of\nall the individual circumstances, and \u2018a\u2019 will then count\nas a vague singular. Dorp\u2019s view was not adopted any more than was\nBuridan\u2019s own.  For most later logicians, the vague singular was\n(contrary to Dorp) one type of singular term, but (contrary to\nBuridan) less properly singular than the proper name, on the grounds\nthat it did indeed involve some generality. \n\n\nBuridan\u2019s treatment of proper names depends on his insistence that a\nsingular term must be subordinated to a singular concept, and that the\nformation of a singular concept depends on the actual presence of the\nsingular thing. No one can hand on a singular concept to another by\ndefinition or explanation. In his Questiones in\nMetaphysicam, Buridan considered the names\n\u2018Antichrist\u2019 and \u2018Aristotle\u2019. He argued that\n\u2018Antichrist\u2019, the favorite example of a name referring to\na person who does not yet exist, is not a singular term, since it is\nformed from \u2018anti\u2019 and \u2018Christ\u2019, and could\napply to many individuals. He then turned to his own favourite\nexample, \u2018Aristotle\u2019.  If I am in the presence of\nAristotle, and I dub him \u2018Aristotle\u2019, then the name is a\ngenuinely singular term. But if Aristotle is a figure in the distant\npast, then my concept of Aristotle must be a descriptive one,\ncontaining such general elements as \u2018man\u2019, \u2018great\nphilosopher\u2019, \u2018born in Greece\u2019, and so on. Given that there was\nindeed such a man, having just those characteristics, then my concept\nsupposits for Aristotle, and so stability of reference is guaranteed,\nbut since the concept is not and cannot be a singular concept, it\nseems that \u2018Aristotle\u2019 cannot be a proper singular term\nwhen uttered by me, but only an individual by circumlocution. \n\n\nBuridan adds a very important clause to his discussion at this\npoint. He remarks that I can treat \u2018Aristotle\u2019 as a\nsingular term because I believe that the name was imposed or given its\nsignification by a person who did have the appropriate singular\nconcept. This move allows him to avoid the awkward consequence that\nwhether \u2018Aristotle\u2019 is a proper name or not depends\nentirely on the experience of the speakers, and not at all on the\nlinguistic practices of the community.  If I have never known\nAristotle, but am speaking with someone who did know him, we can both\nbe taken to be using a proper name when we utter the word\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019.  Buridan\u2019s remarks can be expanded in at\nleast two closely related ways. On the one hand, given his references\nto an original baptism or name-giving ceremony, we can regard Buridan\nas offering an early hint of the historical chain theory of proper\nnames. On the other hand, given his apparent recognition that the\nspeaker\u2019s intention to refer to the person who was baptized is related\nto a body of information which, accurate or not, is causally connected\nwith the man baptized \u2018Aristotle\u2019, perhaps Buridan is\nnearer to the richer causal account given by Gareth Evans.  Buridan\u2019s\nhints were picked up, though not developed, by later authors. For\ninstance, Dorp remarked that we treat such names as\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 as singular because they were singular for the\noriginal impositor.\n\n\nThe importance of some sort of causal link between the original\nproducer of the name and the individual named and its relation to the\nrepresentative nature of even singular concepts was brought out by\nBuridan and Dorp in their discussion of two cases. In the first case,\nPlato and Socrates are exactly similar and, without my knowing it, one\nreplaces the other in my field of sight. Buridan and Dorp argue that\nwhile my first-formed singular concept is equally similar to the\nsecond person to appear, it is not a concept of him, because it is\ncaused by a different individual. The criterion for distinction is not\nthe fit between concept and object but the causal relation.  The\nsecond case was discussed by Dorp alone.  If identical twins are born,\nand are both called \u2018Socrates\u2019, it may seem that\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 will function as a common name in this case,\nbecause the concepts will be exactly alike, but here too the causal\nrelation becomes all-important.  There are two singular terms, each\nwith its own signification.\n10. Proper Names and Identity through Time\n\n\nFurther issues to do with proper names arose from Buridan\u2019s discussion\nof identity through time in the last redaction of his commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics where he posed the question \u201cIs\nSocrates the same today that he was yesterday?\u201d In his answer,\nBuridan makes a careful distinction between three kinds of numerical\nidentity through time. In the strictest sense, being totally the same\nin number, no change of any kind is allowed, and so there are very few\nreal individuals, perhaps only God. In the less strict sense, being\npartially the same in number, the continuity of one part is\nsufficient. Socrates is the same Socrates despite bodily changes,\nbecause he has the same soul, but the human body will not retain its\nidentity through time, and neither will a horse. In the least strict\nsense of identity, being the same according to the continuity of\ndiverse parts succeeding one another, we find that animals, bodies,\nand rivers can be regarded as minimally the same through time. The\nSeine is the same river now as it was ten years ago because of the\ncontinuous succession of water-parts. This allows us to use the word\n\u2018Seine\u2019 as if it were a singular term in accordance with\nthe customary modes of speech.  It is important to note that we are\nallowed to retain singular concepts through memory, so I can keep the\nsame concept through time provided I have had the requisite original\nexperience of the individual in question.\n\n\nOne consequence of Buridan\u2019s account is that the names\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 and \u2018Aristotle\u2019 on the one hand and\n\u2018Seine\u2019 and \u2018Brownie\u2019 (the donkey) on the\nother have a different status. The former are more properly singular\nterms than the latter even for those who are acquainted with all of\nthese individuals through time. Domingo de Soto was strongly opposed\nto this consequence. He appealed to Aristotle\u2019s doctrines in order to\nargue that the continuity of soul is not the only condition for\nidentity of the second type, and that horses, trees and even rivers\ncould enjoy a strong enough identity, by virtue of the continuity of\ntheir forms and functions, to give a basis for the application of one\nsingular concept through time.\n\n\nAnother consequence of Buridan\u2019s account is found in some early\nsixteenth-century logicians whose reflection on the problem of\nidentity through time led them to adopt an even more restrictive\naccount of proper names than Buridan himself had countenanced, and one\nwhich has much in common with Roger Bacon\u2019s theory (see\n\u00a77). These logicians argued that a sequence of different concepts\nof Socrates will be formed through time, even by one acquainted with\nhim, and hence that the name \u2018Socrates\u2019 is no more a\nproper singular term than is the name \u2018Seine\u2019. It is\nradically equivocal, since at every moment it is subordinated to a\ndifferent concept. Nor is this incompatible with the intentions of the\nperson who originally gave Socrates his name. Strictly speaking, only\nthe baby was called Socrates, but the name was imposed equivalently or\nas a consequence to signify every successor to the boy by means of\ndifferent concepts. \n\n\n Once more, Domingo de Soto was strongly opposed. He said that to\nregard the name \u2018Socrates\u2019 as an equivocal term which\nrefers to a succession of individuals is a denial of common speech and\nof the common sense of the wise men who originally gave terms their\nsignification.
