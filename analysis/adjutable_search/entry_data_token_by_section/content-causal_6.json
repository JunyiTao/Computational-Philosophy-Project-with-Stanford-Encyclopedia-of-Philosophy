    "main_text": "Specific Causal Theories of Mental Content || Asymmetric Dependency Theory\n3.4 Asymmetric Dependency Theory\n\nThe preceding attempts to distinguish the content-determining causes\nfrom non-content-determining causes focused on the background or\nboundary conditions under which the distinct types of causes may be\nthought to act. Fodor\u2019s Asymmetric Dependency Theory (ADT),\nhowever, represents a bold alternative to these approaches. Although\nFodor (1987, 1990a, b, 1994) contain numerous variations on the\ndetails of the theory, the core idea is that the content-determining\ncause is in an important sense fundamental, where the\nnon-content-determining causes are non-fundamental. The sense of being\nfundamental is that the non-content-determining causes depend on the\ncontent-determining cause; the non-content-determining causes would\nnot exist if not for the content-determining cause. Put a bit more\ntechnically, there are numerous laws such as \u2018Y1\ncauses \u201cX\u201d,\u2019 \u2018Y2 causes\n\u201cX\u201d,\u2019 etc., but none of these laws would exist were\nit not a law that X causes \u201cX\u201d. The fact that the \u2018X\ncauses \u201cX\u201d\u2019 law does not in the same way depend on\nany of the Y1, Y2, \u2026, Yn laws\nmakes the dependence asymmetric. Hence, there is an asymmetric\ndependency between the laws. The intuition here is that the question,\n\u2018What kind of animal is called \u201cFido\u201d?\u2019 will\ncause an occurrence of the representation \u201cX\u201d only because\nof the fact that dogs cause \u201cX\u201d. Instances of foxes cause\ninstances of \u201cX\u201d only because foxes are mistaken for dogs\nand dogs cause instances of \u201cX\u201d.\n\nCausation is typically understood to have a temporal dimension. First\nthere is event C and this event C subsequently leads to event E. Thus,\nwhen the ADT is sometimes referred to as the \u201cAsymmetric Causal\nDependency Theory,\u201d the term \u201ccausal\u201d might suggest\na diachronic picture in which there is, first, an X-\u201cX\u201d\nlaw which subsequently gives rise to the various Y-\u201cX\u201d\nlaws. Such a diachronic interpretation, however, would lead to\ncounterexamples for the ADT approach. Fodor (1987) discusses this\npossibility. Consider Pavlovian conditioning. Food causes salivation\nin a dog. Then a bell causes salivation in the dog. It is likely that\nthe bell causes salivation only because the food causes it. Yet,\nsalivation hardly means food. It may well naturally mean that food is\npresent, but salivation is not a thought or thought content and it is\nnot ripe for false semantic tokening. Or take a more exotic kind of\ncase. Suppose that one comes to apply \u201cX\u201d to dogs, but\nonly by means of observations of foxes. This would be a weird case of\n\u201clearning\u201d, but if things were to go this way, one would\nnot want \u201cX\u201d to mean fox. To block this kind of objection,\nthe theory maintains the dependency between the fundamental\nX-\u201cX\u201d law and the non-fundamental Y-\u201cX\u201d laws\nis synchronic. The dependency is such that if one were to break the\nX-\u201cX\u201d law at time t, then one would thereby\ninstantaneously break all the Y-\u201cX\u201d laws at that time.\n\nThe core of ADT, therefore, comes down to this. \u201cX\u201d means\nX if\n\n\u2018Xs cause \u201cX\u201ds\u2019 is a law,\nFor all Ys that are not Xs, if Ys qua Ys actually cause\n\u201cX\u201ds, then the Y\u2019s causing \u201cX\u201ds is\nasymmetrically dependent on the Xs causing \u201cX\u201ds,\nThe dependence in (2) is synchronic (not\ndiachronic).\n\n\nThis seems to get a number of cases right. The reason that questions\nlike \u201cWhat kind of animal is named \u2018Fido\u2019?\u201d or\n\u201cWhat is a Sheltie?\u201d trigger \u201cX\u201d, meaning dog,\nis that dogs are able to trigger \u201cX\u201ds. Foxes only trigger\n\u201cX\u201ds, meaning dog, because dogs are able to trigger them.\nMoreover, it appears to solve the disjunction problem. Suppose we have\na \u2018dogs cause \u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law and a \u2018dogs or\nfoxes cause \u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law. If one breaks the \u2018dogs\ncause \u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law, then one thereby breaks the\n\u2018dogs or foxes cause \u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law, since the only\nreason either dogs or foxes cause \u201cX\u201ds is because dogs do.\nMoreover, if one breaks the \u2018dogs or foxes cause\n\u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law, one does not thereby break the\n\u2018dogs cause \u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law, since dogs alone might\nsuffice to cause \u201cX\u201ds. So, the \u2018dogs or foxes cause\n\u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law depends on the \u2018dogs cause\n\u201cX\u201ds\u2019 law, but not vice versa. Asymmetric dependency\nof laws gives the right\n results.[9]\n3.4.1 Objections to ADT\n\nAdams and Aizawa (1994) mention an important class of causes that the\nADT does not appear to handle, namely, the \u201cnon-psychological\ninterventions\u201d. We have all along assumed the \u201cX\u201d is\nsome sort of brain event, such as the firing of some neurons. But, it\nis plausible that some interventions, such as a dose of hallucinogen\nor maybe some carefully placed microelectrodes, could trigger such\nbrain events, quite apart from the connection of those brain events to\nother events in the external world. If essentially all brain events\nare so artificially inducible, then it would appear that for all\nputative mental representations, there will be some laws, such as\n\u2018microelectrodes cause \u201cX\u201ds,\u2019 that do not\ndepend on laws such as \u2018dogs causes \u201cX\u201ds.\u2019 If\nthis is the case, then the second condition of the ADT would rarely or\nnever be satisfied, so that the theory would have little relevance to\nactual cognitive scientific practice.\n\nFodor (1990a) discusses challenges that arise with the fact that the\nperception of objects involves causal intermediaries. Suppose that\nthere is a dog-\u201cX\u201d law that is mediated entirely by\nsensory mechanisms. In fact, suppose unrealistically that the\ndog-\u201cX\u201d law is mediated by a single visual sensory\nprojection. In other words let the dog-\u201cX\u201d law be mediated\nby the combination of a dog-dogsp law and a\ndogsp-\u201cX\u201d law. Under these conditions, it\nappears that \u201cX\u201d means dogsp, rather than dog.\nCondition (1) is satisfied, since there is a\ndogsp-\u201cX\u201d law. Condition (2) is satisfied,\nsince if one were to break the dogsp-\u201cX\u201d law\none would thereby break the dog-\u201cX\u201d law (i.e., there is a\ndependence of one law one the other) and breaking the\ndog-\u201cX\u201d law would not necessarily break the\ndogsp-\u201cX\u201d law (i.e., the dependence is not\nsymmetric). The dependence is asymmetric, because one can break the\ndog-\u201cX\u201d law by breaking the dog-dogsp law (by\nchanging the way dogs look) without thereby breaking the\ndogsp-\u201cX\u201d law. Finally, condition (3) is\nsatisfied, since the dependence of the dog-\u201cX\u201d law on the\ndogsp-\u201cX\u201d law is synchronic.\n\nThe foregoing version of the sensory projections problem relies on\nwhat was noted to be the unrealistic assumption that the\ndog-\u201cX\u201d law is mediated by a single visual sensory\nprojection. Relaxing the assumption does not so much solve the problem\nas transform it. So, adopt the more realistic assumption that the\ndog-\u201cX\u201d law is sustained by a combination of a large set\nof dog-sensory projection laws and a large set of\ndogsp-\u201cX\u201d laws. In the first set, we have laws\nconnecting dogs to particular patterns of retinal stimulation, laws\nconnecting dogs to particular patterns of acoustic stimulation, etc.\nIn the second set, we have certain psychological laws connecting\nparticular patterns of retinal stimulation to \u201cX\u201d, certain\npsychological laws connecting particular patterns of acoustic\nstimulation to \u201cX\u201d, etc. In this sort of situation, there\nthreatens to be no \u201cfundamental\u201d law, no law on which all\nother laws asymmetrically depend. If one breaks the\ndog-\u201cX\u201d law one does not thereby break any of the sensory\nprojection-\u201cX\u201d laws, since the former can be broken by\ndissolving all of the dog-sensory projection laws. If, however, one\nbreaks any one of the particular dogsp-\u201cX\u201d\nlaws, e.g. one connecting a particular doggish visual appearance to\n\u201cX\u201d, one does not thereby break the dog-\u201cX\u201d\nlaw. The other sensory projections might sustain the\ndog-\u201cX\u201d law. Moreover, breaking the law connecting a\nparticular doggish look to \u201cX\u201d will not thereby break a\nlaw connecting a particular doggish sound to \u201cX\u201d. Without\na \u201cfundamental\u201d law, there is no meaning in virtue of the\nconditions of the ADT. Further, the applicability of the ADT appears\nto be dramatically reduced insofar as connections between mental\nrepresentations and properties in the world are mediated by sensory\nprojections. (See Neander, 2013, Schulte, 2018, Artiga &\nSebasti\u00e1n, 2020, for discussion of the distality problem for\nother causal theories.)\n\nAnother problem arises with items or kinds that are indistinguishable.\nAdams and Aizawa (1994), and, implicitly, McLaughlin, (1991), among\nothers, have discussed this problem. As one example, consider the time\nat which the two minerals, jadeite and nephrite, were chemically\nindistinguishable and were both thought to be jade. As another, one\nmight appeal to H2O and XYZ (the stuff of philosophical\nthought experiments, the water look-alike substance found on\ntwin-earth). Let X = jadeite and Y = nephrite and let there be laws\n\u2018jadeite causes \u201cX\u201d\u2019 and \u2018nephrite\ncauses \u201cX\u201d\u2019. Can \u201cX\u201d mean jadeite? No.\nCondition (1) is satisfied, since it is a law that \u2018jadeite\ncauses \u201cX\u201d\u2019. Condition (3) is satisfied, since\nbreaking the jadeite-\u201cX\u201d law will immediately break the\nnephrite-\u201cX\u201d law. If jadeite cannot trigger an\n\u201cX\u201d, then neither can nephrite, since the two are\nindistinguishable. That is, there is a synchronic dependence of the\n\u2018nephrite causes \u201cX\u201d\u2019 law on the\n\u2018jadeite causes \u201cX\u201d law. The problem arises with\ncondition (2). Breaking the jadeite-\u201cX\u201d law will thereby\nbreak the nephrite-\u201cX\u201d law, but breaking the\nnephrite-\u201cX\u201d law will also thereby break the\njadeite-\u201cX\u201d law. Condition (2) cannot be satisfied, since\nthere is a symmetric dependence between the jadeite-\u201cX\u201d\nlaw and the nephrite-\u201cX\u201d law. By parity of reasoning,\n\u201cX\u201d cannot mean nephrite. So, can \u201cX\u201d mean\njade? No. As before, conditions (1) and (3) could be satisfied, since\nthere could be a jade-\u201cX\u201d law and the\njadeite-\u201cX\u201d law and the nephrite-\u201cX\u201d law could\nsynchronically depend on it. The problem is, again, with condition\n(2). Presumably breaking the jade-\u201cX\u201d law would break the\njadeite-\u201cX\u201d and nephrite-\u201cX\u201d law, but breaking\neither of them would break the jade-\u201cX\u201d law. The problem\nis, again, with symmetric dependencies.\n\nHere is a problem that we earlier found in conjunction with other\ncausal theories. Despite the bold new idea underlying the ADT method\nof partitioning off non-content-determining causes, it too appears to\nsneak in naturalistically unacceptable assumptions. Like all causal\ntheories of mental content, the asymmetric causal dependencies are\nsupposed to be the basis upon which meaning is created; the\ndependencies are not themselves supposed to be a product, or\nbyproduct, of meaning. Yet, ADT appears to violate this naturalistic\npre-condition for causal theories. (This kind of objection may be\nfound in Seager (1993), Adams & Aizawa (1994), (1994b), Wallis\n(1995), and Gibson (1996)). Ys are supposed to cause \u201cX\u201ds\nonly because Xs do and this must not be because of any semantic facts\nabout \u201cX\u201ds. So, what sort of mechanism would bring about\nsuch asymmetric dependencies among things connected to the syntactic\nitem \u201cX\u201d? In fact, why wouldn\u2019t lots of things be\nable to cause \u201cX\u201ds besides Xs, quite independently of the\nfact that Xs do? The instantiation of \u201cX\u201ds in the brain\nis, say, some set of neurochemical events. There should be natural\ncauses capable of producing such events in one\u2019s brain under a\nvariety of circumstances. Why on earth would foxes be able to cause\nthe neurochemical \u201cX\u201d events in us only because dogs can?\nOne might be tempted to observe that \u201cX\u201d means dog,\n\u201cY\u201d means fox, we associate foxes with dogs and that is\nwhy foxes cause \u201cX\u201ds only because dogs cause\n\u201cX\u201ds. We would not associate foxes with \u201cX\u201ds\nunless we associated \u201cX\u201ds with dogs and foxes with dogs.\nThis answer, however, involves deriving the asymmetric causal\ndependencies from meanings, which violates the background assumption\nof the naturalization project. Unless there is a better explanation of\nsuch asymmetrical dependencies, it may well be that the theory is\nmisguided in attempting to rest meaning upon them.\n",
