    "main_text": "\nOntology, as etymology suggests, is the study of being, of\nwhat there is. The ontologist asks: What entities or kinds of entity\nexist? Are there abstract entities, such as sets or numbers, in\naddition to concrete entities, such as people and puddles and protons?\nAre there properties or universals in addition to (or instead of) the\nparticular entities that, as we say, instantiate them? Questions such\nas these have divided philosophers down the ages, and divide them no\nless to this day.\nMeta-ontology concerns itself with the nature and\nmethodology of ontology, with the interpretation and significance of\nontological questions such as those exhibited above. The problem\nof ontological commitment is a problem in meta-ontology rather\nthan ontology\n proper.[1] \nThe meta-ontologist asks (among other\nthings): What entities or kinds of entity exist according to a\ngiven theory or discourse, and thus are among\nits ontological commitments? Having a criterion of\nontological commitment for theories is needed, arguably, if one is to\nsystematically and rigorously attack the problem of ontology:\ntypically, we accept entities into our ontology via accepting\ntheories that are ontologically committed to those entities. A\ncriterion of ontological commitment, then, is a pre-requisite for\nontological inquiry.\nOn its face, the notion of ontological commitment for theories is a\nsimple matter. Theories have truth conditions. These truth conditions\ntell us how the world must be in order for the theory to be true; they\nmake demands on the world. Sometimes, perhaps always, they demand of\nthe world that certain entities or kinds of entity exist. The\nontological commitments of a theory, then, are just the entities or\nkinds of entity that must exist in order for the theory to be\ntrue. End of story (compare Rayo 2007: 428).\nBut complications arise as soon as one tries to specify a theory's\ntruth conditions: different accounts of truth conditions lead to\ndifferent accounts of ontological commitment.  Moreover, theories\ncouched in ordinary language do not wear their truth\nconditions\u2014or their ontological commitments\u2014on their\nsleeves. Thus, the need arises to find a criterion of\nontological commitment: a test or method that can be applied to\ntheories in a neutral way to determine the theory's ontological\ncommitments. For example, perhaps the theory should first be\ntranslated into a canonical formal language, such as the language of\nfirst-order predicate logic, where truth conditions, and thus\nontological commitments, are easier to specify. But whenever these\ntranslations are controversial, so will be the verdicts as to\nontological commitment. And, even when translated into a formal\nlanguage, such as the language of first-order predicate logic,\ndifferent ontological standpoints may disagree as to the existential\npresuppositions of the theory. The notion of ontological commitment,\nintroduced to help resolve disputes in ontology, becomes hostage to\nthose very disputes. Strife over the ontological commitments of\ntheories begins to appear inevitable.\nThe following article canvasses and evaluates the most prominent\napproaches to ontological commitment. It starts with Quinean\napproaches that focus on the existential quantifier and the values of\nthe variables. It then contrasts Quinean approaches with more general\nentailment approaches that drop the preoccupation with the\nquantifier. It then considers a strengthening of the entailment\napproach that requires that ontological commitments of a theory\nbe truthmakers for that theory. It then steps back to examine\nhow, and to what extent, the notion of ontological commitment can be\napplied to ordinary language. The article concludes by considering\nless orthodox views associated with Frege and with Carnap.\n",
