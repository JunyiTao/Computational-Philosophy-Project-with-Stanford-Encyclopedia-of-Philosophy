    "main_text": "The doctrinal significance of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n5. The doctrinal significance of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n\nTempier\u2019s condemnation has often been depicted as the most\ndramatic and significant doctrinal censure in the history of the\nUniversity of Paris, and a landmark in the history of medieval\nphilosophy and theology. Yet, the doctrinal significance of the\ncondemnation has received very diverse assessments. Since the\nappearance of the studies by Pierre Mandonnet and Fernand van\nSteenberghen, Tempier\u2019s condemnation has come to be associated\nwith the opposition between faith and reason, caused by the\nintroduction of newly translated philosophical sources in the Latin\nWest, in particular Aristotle and his commentator Averroes. Studies\nwhich present Tempier\u2019s condemnation as a response to\n\u201cAverroism\u201d or to \u201cradical Aristotelianism,\u201d\nfollow this line of interpretation.\n\nThis interpretation is often associated with the view that\nTempier\u2019s action was a symptom of an already existing opposition\nto rationalism, that is, against philosophical research pursued\nwithout concern for Christian orthodoxy. Evidence of the presence of\nrationalist tendencies at the University of Paris was found in certain\narticles of Tempier\u2019s syllabus, or in the prefatory letter in\nwhich Tempier expounded his notion of double truth. According to\nTempier, some scholars maintained that certain views were true\naccording to philosophy, but not according to Catholic faith,\n\u201cas if there were two contrary truths, and as if against the\ntruth of Sacred Scripture, there is truth in the sayings of the\ncondemned pagans.\u201d\n\nThe so-called theory of double truth has been the source of much\nconfusion. Nowadays, scholars agree that there were no medieval\nauthors who entertained the philosophically absurd theory that two\ncontradictory propositions \u2013 one derived from philosophical\ninvestigation, the other from Christian revelation--can both be true\nat the same time. Rather, Tempier\u2019s reproach should be taken as\nan attempt to ridicule the hermeneutical practice of commentators to\nevaluate a doctrine (for instance Aristotle\u2019s) from a\nphilosophical point of view (\u201cphilosophically speaking\u201d)\nand from faith. In reality, however, medieval scholars generally\nsupposed that in cases of conflict between reason and faith, the truth\nwas always on the side of the faith.\n\nIn more recent times, the idea that Tempier\u2019s condemnation was a\nsymptom of the existence of rationalist currents at the University of\nParis, in the sense of the emergence of philosophy as an autonomous\ndiscipline vis-\u00e0-vis divine revelation, has been further\ndeveloped by scholars such as Alain de Libera, Kurt Flasch, and Luca\nBianchi. Although there are differences in detail and in emphasis,\nthey view Tempier\u2019s action as an attempt to curb the concept of\nphilosophy as a comprehensive doctrine of natural knowledge aimed at\nthe attainment of happiness here in this life, rather than after\ndeath. Their studies about the significance of Tempier\u2019s\ncondemnation also address fundamental questions about the nature of\nphilosophy in the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the historiography of medieval science, the views of Pierre Duhem,\nhave proven to be extremely influential. Duhem believed that Tempier,\nwith his insistence of God\u2019s absolute power, had liberated\nChristian thought from the dogmatic acceptance of Aristotelianism, and\nin this way marked the birth of modern science. Especially articles 39\nand 49 played a pivotal role in his eyes. Duhem\u2019s thesis has\nopened up the historiography of medieval science as a serious academic\ndiscipline. Yet, at the same time, no one in the field any longer\nendorses his view that modern science started in 1277. Of contemporary\nhistorians of science, Edward Grant probably comes closest to\nDuhem\u2019s vision, though his view includes many refinements and\nhistorical materials that were unknown to Duhem.\n\nIn any case, it is clear that the condemnation did have an impact on\nscholars at the university. Peter of Auvergne, for instance, wrote two\nsets of questions on Aristotle\u2019s De caelo, one of which was\nposterior to Tempier\u2019s condemnation. There, Peter of Auvergne\nchanged his views on such crucial issues as the world\u2019s\neternity, the animation of the heavens and the existence of an\ninfinite multitude.\n",
