    "main_text": "Event Metaphysics and Semantics || Existence\n3.1 Existence\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, one finds a prima facie\ncommitment to events in various aspects of human perception, action,\nlanguage, and thought. In the contemporary philosophical literature\nhowever, the main line of argument offered to back up this commitment\ncomes from considerations of logical form. Not only does ordinary talk\ninvolve explicit reference to and quantification over events, as when\none says that Caesar\u2019s death was violent or that\ntwo explosions were heard last night. Ordinary talk also\nseems to involve several ways of adverting to events implicitly.\nAdverbial modification is a standard example (Reichenbach 1947; Prior\n1949; Kenny 1963). We say that Brutus stabbed Caesar with a knife. If\nthis statement is taken to assert that a certain three-place relation\nobtains among Brutus, Caesar, and a knife, then it is hard to explain\nwhy the statement entails that Brutus stabbed Caesar (a statement that\ninvolves a different, two-place relation). By contrast, if we take our\nstatement to assert that a certain event occurred (namely, a stabbing\nof Caesar by Brutus) and that it had a certain property\n(namely, of being done with a knife), then the entailment is\nstraightforward (Davidson 1967a; Parsons 1985). Similarly for static\nevents, as with the inference from \u2018Brutus is in the park under\nthe tree\u2019 to \u2018Brutus is in the park\u2019 (Parsons 1988).\nThese reasons do not constitute a proof that there are such entities\nas events. But they are telling insofar as one is interested in an\naccount of how it is that certain statements mean what they mean,\nwhere the meaning of a statement is at least in part determined by its\nlogical relations to other statements. For another example, it has\nbeen argued that singular causal statements cannot be analyzed in\nterms of a causal connective (essentially for reasons having to do\nwith the above-mentioned slingshot argument) but rather require that\ncausation be treated as a binary relation holding between individual\nevents (Davidson 1967b). A third example involves the semantics of\nperceptual reports with naked infinitive complements, as in\n\u2018Cassius saw Brutus flee\u2019, which is analyzed as\n\u2018Cassius saw an event that was a fleeing by Brutus\u2019\n(Higginbotham 1983; Vlach 1983; Gisborne 2010). Still a fourth example\ninvolves the logical form of statements with plural subjects, such as\n\u2018Brutus and Cassius lifted a heavy stone (together)\u2019,\nwhich is analyzed as reporting, not the exploits of a \u201cplural\nobject\u201d, but rather an event involving more than one agent\n(Higginbotham & Schein 1986; Schein 1993; Lasersohn 1990, 1995;\nLandman 1996, 2000). Many more such arguments have been offered, also\nby authors working within different programs in linguistics (Parsons\n1990; Peterson 1997; Rothstein 1998; Link 1998; Higginbotham et\nal. 2000; Pietroski 2005; Mittwoch 2005; van Lambalgen & Hamm\n2005; Robering 2014).\n\nOn the other hand, some philosophers have been dissatisfied with this\nsort of \u201cexistential proof\u201d and have argued instead that\nall talk that seems to involve explicit or implicit reference to or\nquantification over events can be paraphrased so as to avoid the\ncommitment. For example, it has been argued that a term such as\n\u2018Anita\u2019s walk\u2019 goes proxy for the corresponding\nstatement \u2018Anita walked\u2019, so to say that Anita\u2019s\nwalk was pleasant is just to say that Anita walked pleasantly (Geach\n1965). Similar paraphrases have been offered to deal with the case of\nexplicit quantifier-phrases such as \u2018two explosions\u2019 as\nwell as with the implicit event quantification that lies behind\nadverb-dropping inferences (Parsons 1970; Clark 1970, 1974; Schwartz\n1975; Fulton 1979; Graves 1994), singular causal statements (Horgan\n1978, 1982; Wilson 1985, Needham 1988, 1994, Mellor 1991, 1995), and\nso on. On the face of it, it appears that questions of logical form\nleave the existential issue undecided, at least insofar as an\nevent-committing analysis automatically turns into an eliminativist\nparaphrase when read in the opposite direction (and vice versa). Even\nthe absence of suitable paraphrases may be seen as a mere linguistic\nlimitation that should not force us to \u201caccept\u201d events\ninto our ontology (Melia 2000), just as avoiding commitment via\nparaphrase may not be a reason to \u201creject\u201d them (Goldwater\n2023).\n",
