    "main_text": "Paradox || Grelling\u2019s Paradox\n4.2 Grelling\u2019s Paradox\n\nThis paradox is usually\u2014and was originally\u2014formulated as\npertaining to adjectives expressing properties that are or are not\ntrue of the adjective (the word) itself. For example,\n\u201cshort\u201d is short, whereas \u201cred\u201d is not red.\nThose adjectives that have the properties they express are termed\n\u201cautological\u201d and those that don\u2019t are termed\n\u201cheterological\u201d. The problem arises with the question: Is\n\u201cheterological\u201d heterological or not? And the answer is\nthat it is if and only if it\u2019s not. But the paradox is better\nformulated in terms of the extensions, in general, of any sort of\npredicate\u2014adjective, common noun, or verb phrase. Some\npredicates belong to their own extensions and some do not. The problem\narises if it supposed that there is a\npredicate\u2014\u201cheterological\u201d\u2014whose extension\nconsists of exactly those predicates that do not belong to their own\nextensions, since then \u201cheterological\u201d belongs to its\nextension if and only if it does not.\n\nViewed in this way, the reasoning of the paradox is in direct\nviolation of Cantor\u2019s theorem. The latter theorem is usually\nthought of as the principle that the cardinality of the power set of a\nset is greater than that of the set; and applied to an infinite set,\nthis leads to the sequence of ever larger infinite cardinal numbers.\nBut in its most basic form\u2014from which the result about\ncardinality follows as a corollary\u2014Cantor\u2019s theorem is the\nfollowing set theoretical principle:\n\nCantor\u2019s Lemma (CL)\n\nLet \\(f\\) be a function with domain \\(A\\) and range \\(B\\). Then the\nset: \\(D_{f} = \\{x \\in A: x \\not\\in f(x)\\}\\) is not in \\(B\\).\n\nProof. If \\(D_f\\) is in \\(B\\), then there is some \\(y\\) in\n\\(A\\) such that \\(f(y) = D_f\\). It now follows that \\(y\\) is in\n\\(D_f\\) iff it\u2019s not. Contradiction. Note that when \\(A = B\\)\nand \\(f\\) is the identity map defined on \\(A\\), the result is (a form\nof) the theorem asserting that the set of non-self-membered sets does\nnot exist.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning, firstly, that this principle underlies\ndiagonal argumentation in general (cf. Gaifman 2006). Even venerable\nexamples such as Post\u2019s informal argument that there is a\nrecursively enumerable set of positive integers whose complement is\nnot recursively enumerable, rely in essence on\n CL\n (Davis 1965: 312). A slight variant of CL is frequently found in the\nliterature on undecidability (cf. Shoenfield 1967: 131). Secondly, the\nproof of CL only relies\u00a0on minimal set-theoretic resources. Of\ncourse, the famous corollary of CL about cardinality relies\non\u00a0the power set axiom. But the theorem that there can be no\none-one function from a set onto its power set is otherwise a direct\nconsequence of CL. In this case, \\(D_f\\) must be in \\(B\\), since it\nbelongs to the power set of \\(A\\), and the conclusion must be that\n\\(f\\) does not exist. Third, Grelling\u2019s paradox as well as\nBerry\u2019s paradox can be used as a basis for alternative proofs of\nthe first incompleteness theorem (Boolos et al. 2007; Kripke 2014).\nLastly, a somewhat more general form of CL pertaining to relations in\ngeneral\u2014not just to functions\u2014, which is now accepted as a\nversion of Cantor\u2019s Theorem, was already noticed by Russell\n(1903). Whereas CL is essentially a principle of first order logic,\nthe relational version is second order in nature.\n\nTo say that \\(D_f\\) is not an element of \\(B\\), where \\(B\\) is the\nrange of \\(f\\), is to say that there is no element \\(x\\) of \\(A\\) such\nthat \\(f(x) = D_f\\). Applied to predicates and their extensions,\n CL\n implies that for any function \\(g\\) mapping some predicates\n\\(A\\) to their extensions, there is a predicate\n\u201cheterological\\(_g\\)\u201d whose extension is \\(D_g\\) although\nthis predicate cannot be in the domain of \\(g\\). However, assuming\nthat there is a function, \\(h\\), mapping every predicate to\nits extension, there can be no predicate, heterological\\(_h\\), at\nall, whose extension is \\(D_h\\). From a Tarskian point of view,\nheterological\\(_h\\), must be a predicate of the metalanguage. From\nChurch\u2019s point of view, there are a multiplicity of\nheterological predicates analogous to, but not the same as, the\nheterological\\(_g\\) predicates, distinguished by their types and\norders in the ramified hierarchy. CL is exploited in the next\nsection.\n",
