    "main_text": "The Texts\n2. The Texts\n\nOur knowledge of later Mohist thought comes from six texts, which form\nBooks 40 through 45 of the Mozi: two books of terse\n\u201ccanons\u201d (j\u012bng \u7d93), generally just a\nsentence or two in length; two of slightly longer\n\u201cexplanations\u201d (j\u012bng shu\u014d\n\u7d93\u8aaa), keyed to the canons, which provide explanations of\nor arguments for the statements in them; the \u201cGreater\nSelection\u201d (D\u00e0 Q\u01d4 \u5927\u53d6), a\ncollection of fragments on ethics, semantics, and logic, apparently\nincluding the remnants of two or more essays; and the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d (Xi\u01ceo Q\u01d4 \u5c0f\u53d6), which\nappears to be either a coherent essay or a pair of essays. (The origin\nof the titles \u201cGreater Selection\u201d and \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d is unknown. Possibly these were two selections, one\nlonger and one shorter, from the remnants of damaged bamboo scrolls.)\nThe six books as a whole are conventionally known as the M\u00f2\nBi\u00e0n \u58a8\u8faf, or \u201cMohist\n Dialectics.\u201d[2]\n The Canons begin with 87 explications of or equivalence\nformulae for important philosophical, scientific, and mathematical\nterms. Some of these are in effect nominal definitions; others present\nsubstantive views. After a short, textually corrupt section, these are\nfollowed by 86 theses on a variety of subjects. \n\nThe content of the texts is roughly coherent but not tightly so. The\nconcepts and theories presented generally fit together well, with\nvariations in terminology. But the organization of the texts is\nunsystematic. There is no statement of their overall purpose, no clear\norganizational scheme, nor any headings indicating the themes of\ndifferent\n parts.[3]\n The canons do tend to fall into thematic groups, such as series on\nknowledge, the virtues, geometry, or argumentation, but the sequence\nof topics displays no clear pattern. Concepts are introduced only to\nnever be mentioned again, and central terms sometimes go unexplained.\nLike early Chinese mathematicians, the Mohists had no conception of an\naxiomatic system, and the canons do not clearly identify anything\ncorresponding to axioms, definitions, or theorems. Nor are they\narranged as if to explore a specified set of themes or prove some\ndistinct set of conclusions. As a result, interpretation of later\nMohist doctrines can be testing. They must be reconstructed from\nterse, incomplete statements scattered about different parts of the\ncorpus, and on some issues there is insufficient textual evidence to\nreach any firm\n conclusions.[4]\n\n\nFor a brief overview of the fascinating history of the texts and the\nphilological problems associated with them, see the following\nsupplementary document:\n\nTextual History and Philological Issues\n\n",
