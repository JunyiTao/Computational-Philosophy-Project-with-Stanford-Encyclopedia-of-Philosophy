    "main_text": "Objectivity as a Feature of Scientific Communities and Their Practices || Feminist and Standpoint Epistemology\n5.2 Feminist and Standpoint Epistemology\n\nTraditional notions of objectivity as faithfulness to facts or freedom\nof contextual values have also been challenged from a feminist\nperspective. These critiques can be grouped in three major research\nprograms: feminist epistemology, feminist standpoint theory and\nfeminist postmodernism (Crasnow 2013). The program of feminist\nepistemology explores the impact of sex and gender on the\nproduction of scientific knowledge. More precisely, feminist\nepistemology highlights the epistemic risks resulting from the\nsystematic exclusion of women from the ranks of scientists, and the\nneglect of women as objects of study. Prominent case studies are the\nneglect of female orgasm in biology, testing medical drugs on male\nparticipants only, focusing on male specimen when studying the social\nbehavior of primates, and explaining human mating patterns by means of\nimaginary neolithic societies (e.g., Hrdy 1977; Lloyd 1993, 2005). See\nalso the\n entry on feminist philosophy of biology.\n\nOften but not always, feminist epistemologists go beyond pointing out\nwhat they regard as androcentric bias and reject the value-free ideal\naltogether\u2014with an eye on the social and moral responsibility of\nscientific inquiry. They try to show that a value-laden science can\nalso meet important criteria for being epistemically reliable and\nobjective (e.g., Anderson 2004; Kourany 2010). A classical\nrepresentative of such efforts is Longino\u2019s (1990)\ncontextual empiricism. She reinforces Popper\u2019s\ninsistence that \u201cthe objectivity of scientific statements lies\nin the fact that they can be inter-subjectively tested\u201d (1934\n[2002]: 22), but unlike Popper, she conceives scientific knowledge\nessentially as a social product. Thus, our conception of scientific\nobjectivity must directly engage with the social process that\ngenerates knowledge. Longino assigns a crucial function to social\nsystems of criticism in securing the epistemic success of science.\nSpecifically, she develops an epistemology which regards a method of\ninquiry as \u201cobjective to the degree that it permits\ntransformative criticism\u201d (Longino 1990: 76).\nFor an epistemic community to achieve transformative criticism, there\nmust be:\n\n\n\navenues for criticism: criticism is an essential part\nof scientific institutions (e.g., peer review); \n\n\nshared standards: the community must share a set of\ncognitive values for assessing theories (more on this in\n section 3.1);\n\n\n\nuptake of criticism: criticism must be able to\ntransform scientific practice in the long run; \n\n\nequality of intellectual authority: intellectual\nauthority must be shared equally among qualified practitioners.\n\n\n\nLongino\u2019s contextual empiricism can be understood as a\ndevelopment of John Stuart Mill\u2019s view that beliefs should never\nbe suppressed, independently of whether they are true or false. Even\nthe most implausible beliefs might be true, and even if they are\nfalse, they might contain a grain of truth which is worth preserving\nor helps to better articulate true beliefs (Mill 1859 [2003: 72]). The\nunderlying intuition is supported by recent empirical research on the\nepistemic benefits of a diversity of opinions and perspectives (Page\n2007). By stressing the social nature of scientific knowledge, and the\nimportance of criticism (e.g., with respect to potential androcentric\nbias and inclusive practice), Longino\u2019s account fits into the\nbroader project of feminist epistemology.\n\nStandpoint theory undertakes a more radical attack on\ntraditional scientific objectivity. This view develops Marxist ideas\nto the effect that epistemic position is related to, and a product of,\nsocial position. Feminist standpoint theory builds on these ideas but\nfocuses on gender, racial and other social relations. Feminist\nstandpoint theorists and proponents of \u201csituated\nknowledge\u201d such as Donna Haraway (1988), Sandra Harding\n(1991, 2015a, 2015b) and Alison Wylie (2003) deny the internal\ncoherence of a view from nowhere: all human knowledge is at base\nhuman knowledge and therefore necessarily perspectival. But\nthey argue more than that. Not only is perspectivality the human\ncondition, it is also a good thing to have. This is because\nperspectives, especially the perspectives of underprivileged classes\nand groups in society, come along with epistemic benefits. These ideas\nare controversial but they draw attention to the possibility that\nattempts to rid science of perspectives might not only be futile but\nalso costly: they prevent scientists from having the epistemic\nbenefits certain standpoints afford and from developing knowledge\nfor marginalized groups in society. The perspectival stance\ncan also explain why criteria for objectivity often vary with context:\nthe relative importance of epistemic virtues is a matter of goals and\ninterests\u2014in other words, standpoint.\n\nBy endorsing a perspectival stance, feminist standpoint theory rejects\nclassical elements of scientific objectivity such as neutrality and\nimpartiality (see\n section 3.1\n above). This is a notable difference to feminist epistemology, which\nis in principle (though not always in practice) compatible with\ntraditional views of objectivity. Feminist standpoint theory is also a\npolitical project. For example, Harding (1991, 1993) demands that\nscientists, their communities and their practices\u2014in other\nwords, the ways through which knowledge is gained\u2014be\ninvestigated as rigorously as the object of knowledge itself. This\nidea she refers to as \u201cstrong\nobjectivity\u201d replaces the \u201cweak\u201d conception\nof objectivity in the empiricist tradition: value-freedom,\nimpartiality, rigorous adherence to methods of testing and inference.\nLike Feyerabend, Harding integrates a transformation of epistemic\nstandards in science into a broader political project of rendering\nscience more democratic and inclusive. On the other hand, she is\nexposed to similar objections (see also Haack 2003). Isn\u2019t it\ngrossly exaggerated to identify class, race and gender as important\nfactors in the construction of physical theories? Doesn\u2019t the\nfeminist approach\u2014like social constructivist\napproaches\u2014lose sight of the particular epistemic qualities of\nscience? Should non-scientists really have as much authority as\ntrained scientists? To whom does the condition of equally shared\nintellectual authority apply? Nor is it clear\u2014especially in\ntimes of fake news and filter bubbles\u2014whether it is always a\ngood idea to subject scientific results to democratic approval. There\nis no guarantee (arguably there are few good reasons to believe) that\ndemocratized or standpoint-based science leads to more reliable\ntheories, or better decisions for society as a whole.\n",
