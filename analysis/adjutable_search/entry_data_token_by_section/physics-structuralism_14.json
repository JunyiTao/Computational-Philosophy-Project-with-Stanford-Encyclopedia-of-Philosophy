    "main_text": "Three structuralist programs || Ludwig\u2019s program\n5.2 Ludwig\u2019s program\n5.2.1 History and general traits\n\nG\u00fcnther Ludwig (1918\u20132007) was a German physicist mainly\nknown for his work on the foundations of quantum theory. In Ludwig\n(1970, 1985, 1987), he published an axiomatic account of quantum\nmechanics, which was based on the statistical interpretation of\nquantum theory. As a prerequisite for this work he found it necessary\nto ask \u201cWhat is a physical theory?\u201d and developed a\ngeneral concept of a theory on the first 80 pages of his (1970). Later\nthis general theory was expanded into the book Ludwig (1978). A recent\nelaboration of Ludwig\u2019s program can be found in Schr\u00f6ter\n(1996).\n\nHis underlying \u201cphilosophy\u201d is the view that there are\nreal structures in the world which are \u201cpictured\u201d or\nrepresented, in an approximate fashion, by mathematical structures,\nsymbolically \\(\\boldsymbol{PT} = \\boldsymbol{W} (-) \\boldsymbol{MT}\\).\nThe mathematical theory \\(\\boldsymbol{MT}\\) used in a physical theory\n\\(\\boldsymbol{PT}\\) contains as its core a \u201cspecies of\nstructure\u201d \\(\\Sigma\\). This is a meta-mathematical concept of\nBourbaki which Ludwig introduced into the structuralistic approach.\nThe contact between \\(\\boldsymbol{MT}\\) to some \u201cdomain of\nreality\u201d \\(\\boldsymbol{W}\\) is achieved by a set of\ncorrespondence principles \\((-)\\), which give rules for translating\nphysical facts into certain mathematical statements called\n\u201cobservational reports\u201d. These facts are either directly\nobservable or given by means of other physical theories, called\n\u201cpre-theories\u201d of \\(\\boldsymbol{PT}\\). In this way a part\n\\(\\boldsymbol{G}\\) of \\(\\boldsymbol{W}\\), called \u201cbasic\ndomain\u201d is constructed. But it remains a task of the theory to\nconstruct the full domain of reality \\(\\boldsymbol{W}\\), that is, the\nmore complete description of the basic domain that also uses\n\\(\\boldsymbol{PT}\\)-theoretical terms.\n5.2.2 Typical features of Ludwig\u2019s program\n\nSuperficially considered, this concept of theory shows some similarity\nto neo-positivistic ideas and would be subject to similar criticism.\nFor example, the discussion of the so-called\n\u2018theory-laden\u2019 character of observation sentences casts\ndoubts on such notions as \u201cdirectly observable facts\u201d.\nNevertheless, the adherents of the Ludwig approach would probably\nargue for a moderate form of observationalism and would point out\nthat, within Ludwig\u2019s approach, the theory-laden character of\nobservation sentences could be analyzed in detail.\n\nAnother central idea of Ludwig\u2019s program is the description of\nintra- and inter-theoretical approximations by means of \u201cuniform\nstructures\u201d, a mathematical concept lying between topological\nand metrical structures. Although this idea was later adopted by the\nother structuralistic programs, it plays a unique r\u00f4le within\nLudwig\u2019s meta-theory in connection with his finitism. He\nbelieves that the mathematical structures of the infinitely large or\nsmall, a priori, have no physical meaning at all; they are\npreliminary tools to approximate finite physical reality. Uniform\nstructures are vehicles for expressing this particular kind of\napproximation.\n5.2.3 Ludwig\u2019s interpretation of quantum mechanics\n\nWe have already explained that for Ludwig the framework for the\nreconstruction of physical theories was actually only a tool to\ndevelop his interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\nIt is no surprise that there are close relationships between the two\nenterprises. We only mention the fact that the reconstruction of\ntheoretical terms by other terms that are more easily accessible is\nparticularly urgent when the theoretical terms refer to the\nmicroscopic domain. This explains in particular why Ludwig is a\nsupporter of a statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nbecause more advanced interpretations such as the\nsingle-particle-state interpretation of the wave function, in his\nopinion, have no axiomatic basis. In the current debate on the\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, the statistical interpretation\n(or ensemble interpretation) plays only a marginal role and is,\nmoreover, usually attributed to L. E. Ballentine (1970). The Wikipedia\nentry on the \u2018ensemble interpretation\u2019 does not mention\nLudwig at all.\n\nIt would be premature, however, to deny Ludwig any influence on the\ndevelopment of quantum theory. There are some achievements, like the\ngeneralization of observables to POV measures, see Busch et al (2016),\nwhich are well known, e.g., in the community practicing quantum\ninformation theory, and which finally go back to Ludwig. Usually, the\nstandard reference for these generalizations is not Ludwig but his\npupil K. Kraus, see Kraus (1983). Finally it should be mentioned that\nLudwig\u2019s axiomatics of quantum mechanics has been revived by new\nmathematical results, see Casinelli and Lahti (2016).\n5.2.4 Ludwig\u2019s late work\n\nOne year before his death Ludwig, together with G\u00e9rald Thurler,\npublished a revised and simplified edition of Ludwig (1990) with the\ntitle \u201cA new foundation of physical theories\u201d. This work\ncannot be used as a textbook but it is a remarkable document of the\ncentral themes of his approach and his general views on physics. The\nbook clearly shows that Ludwig\u2019s main concern is about\nscientific realism, i.e., about the question of how hypothetical\nobjects and relations occurring within a successful theory acquire the\nstatus of physical reality. Entities which cannot claim this status\nare dubbed as \u201cfairy tales\u201d throughout the book. Examples\nof fairy tales in quantum theory are hidden variables and, perhaps\nsurprising for some readers, also the single-particle-state\ninterpretation (in contrast to the ensemble interpretation fostered by\nLudwig).\n\nAmong the new concepts and tools developed in Ludwig/Thurler (2006)\nare the following:\n\nPhysical observations are first translated into sentences of an\nauxiliary mathematical theory containing only finite sets, and, in a\nsecond step, approximately embedded into an idealized theory. By this\nmaneuver the authors accentuate the contrast between finite physical\noperations and mathematical assumptions involving infinite sets.\nInaccuracy sets and unsharp measurements are always considered\nright from the start and not introduced later as in previous versions\nof the Ludwig program.\nThe \u201cbasic domain\u201d of a theory is now that part of the\n\u201capplication domain\u201d where the theory is successfully\napplied, up to a certain degree of inaccuracy.\nThe complicated terminology concerning various kinds of hypotheses\nin Ludwig (1990) is radically reduced to a small number of cases\nincluding fuzzy hypotheses.\nThe problem of unsharp indirect measurements is reformulated in an\nelegant way which yet should be scrutinized by means of case\nstudies.\n\n5.2.5 Summary\n\nGenerally speaking, Ludwig\u2019s program is, in comparison to those\nof Sneed and Scheibe, less descriptive and more normative with respect\nto physics. He developed an ideal of how physical theories should be\nformulated rather than reconstructing the actual practice. The\nprincipal worked-out example that comes close to this ideal is still\nthe axiomatic account of quantum mechanics, as described in Ludwig\n(1985, 1987).\n",
