The 17th Century: Scholasticism and the Baroque\n\nIn the 17th century, the Dominicans, the Augustinians, the\nJesuits, and the Franciscans continued to cultivate Scholastic\nphilosophy, in accordance with their specific religious orientation.\nHowever, the practice of philosophy was almost always lacking in\ninnovation or critique. A paradigmatic representative of this\ntraditional view of philosophy is Francisco Naranjo, a scholar who was\nknown for his ability to recite the entirety of Thomas Aquinas\u2019\nSumma Theologica by heart. Other philosophers from that same\nperiod include Diego Basalenque, Juan de Rueda, Alonso Guerrero, and\nDiego Mart\u00edn Alc\u00e1zar.\n\nIn Europe, the 17th century is known as the Spanish Golden\nAge, producing figures such as Francisco de Quevedo and Luis de\nG\u00f3ngora in literature, and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and\nBartolom\u00e9 Murillo in painting. Likewise, we can speak of a\nGolden Age in New Spain. Three extraordinary figures of the\n17th century\u2019s Mexican baroque period cannot be\nomitted from a history of Mexican philosophy: Father Miguel\nS\u00e1nchez, Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora, and Sister\nJuana In\u00e9s de la Cruz. All three of them were born in Mexico,\nwrote in Spanish, and were familiar with the N\u00e1huatl language\nand culture.\n\nFather Miguel S\u00e1nchez (1594\u20131674) studied at the\nUniversity of Mexico, but was eventually not accepted as a member of\nits faculty. S\u00e1nchez is the author of Imagen de la Virgen\nMar\u00eda (1648) in which he offers a theological and\nphilosophical interpretation of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Even though\nthe influence of Saint Augustine is dominant in his analysis,\nS\u00e1nchez was one of the first intellectuals to approach human\nhistory from a Latin American perspective.\n\nCarlos Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora (1645\u20131700) was a\nremarkable scientist, historian, and philosopher. He taught astronomy\nand mathematics at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, and\nhe became known for his opposition to the belief that comets were\nharbingers of catastrophes. In his book, Libra astron\u00f3mica\ny filos\u00f3fica (1690 [1984]), Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora\nwas one of the first intellectuals in New Spain to examine the\nadvancements of Galileo Galilei, Descartes, and Kepler with scientific\nrigor. He was also well versed in pre-Columbian thought and culture,\nand rescued the moral and political practices and beliefs of the\nancient Aztecs, presenting them as an example to live by.\n\nSister Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1651\u20131695) was not allowed\nto enroll in the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico because she\nwas a woman. However, she became world-renowned for her wisdom and\nliterary talent. Although Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz was not a\nphilosopher by trade, her writings contain elements of philosophy,\nfrom stoicism and hermeticism to post-Cartesian philosophy. Her long\npoem Primero sue\u00f1o (1692) is an erudite reflection on\nepistemology and theology based on several classical and contemporary\nworks. Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz is also well-known as an early\nfeminist who described the unfavorable conditions under which women\nwere forced to produce their own philosophy. Her \u201cRespuesta a\nSor Filotea de la Cruz\u201d (1691) is a feminist reflection\navant la lettre in which she argues that men and women should\nbe allowed to develop fully under the same conditions. In that\nbrilliant and erudite text, she famously claims that \u201cif\nAristotle would have been a cook, he would have written even\nmore\u201d.\n",
