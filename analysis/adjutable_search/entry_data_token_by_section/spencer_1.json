    "main_text": "Spencer\u2019s \u201cLiberal\u201d Utilitarianism\n3. Spencer\u2019s \u201cLiberal\u201d Utilitarianism\n\nSpencer was a sociologist in part. But he was even more a moral\nphilosopher. He was what we now refer to as a liberal utilitarian\nfirst who traded heavily in evolutionary theory in order to explain\nhow our liberal utilitarian sense of justice emerges.\n\nThough a utilitarian, Spencer took distributive justice no less\nseriously than Mill. For him as for Mill, liberty and justice were\nequivalent. Whereas Mill equated fundamental justice with his liberty\nprinciple, Spencer equated justice with equal liberty, which holds\nthat the \u201cliberty of each, limited by the like liberty of all,\nis the rule in conformity with which society must be organized\u201d\n(Spencer, 1970: 79). Moreover, for Spencer as for Mill, liberty was\nsacrosanct, insuring that his utilitarianism was equally a bona fide\nform of liberalism. For both, respect for liberty also just happened\nto work out for the utilitarian best all things considered.\nIndefeasible liberty, properly formulated, and utility were therefore\nfully compossible.\n\nNow in Spencer\u2019s case, especially by The Principles of\nEthics (1879\u201393), this compossibility rested on a complex\nevolutionary moral psychology combining associationism, Lamarckian\nuse-inheritance, intuitionism and utility. Pleasure-producing activity\nhas tended to generate biologically inheritable associations between\ncertain types of actions, pleasurable feelings and feelings of\napproval. Gradually, utilitarianism becomes\n intuitive.[11]\n And wherever utilitarian intuitions thrive, societies tend to be more\nvibrant as well as stable. Social evolution favors cultures that\ninternalize utilitarian maxims intuitively. Conduct \u201crestrained\nwithin the required limits [stipulated by the principle of equal\nfreedom], calling out no antagonistic passions, favors harmonious\ncooperation, profits the group, and, by implications, profits the\naverage of individuals.\u201d Consequently, \u201cgroups formed of\nmembers having this adaptation of nature\u201d tend \u201cto survive\nand spread\u201d (Spencer, vol. II, 1978: 43). Wherever general\nutility thrives, societies thrive. General utility and cultural\nstamina go hand-in-hand. And general utility thrives best where\nindividuals exercise and develop their faculties within the parameters\nstipulated by equal freedom.\n\nIn short, like any moral intuition, equal freedom favors societies\nthat internalize it and, ultimately, self-consciously invoke it. And\nwherever societies celebrate equal freedom as an ultimate principle of\njustice, well-being flourishes and utilitarian liberalism spreads.\n\nSpencer likewise took moral rights seriously insofar as properly\ncelebrating equal freedom entailed recognizing and celebrating basic\nmoral rights as its \u201ccorollaries.\u201d Moral rights specify\nequal freedom, making its normative requirements substantively\nclearer. They stipulate our most essential sources of happiness,\nnamely life and liberty. Moral rights to life and liberty are\nconditions of general happiness. They guarantee each individual the\nopportunity to exercise his or her faculties according to his or her\nown lights, which is the source of real happiness. Moral rights\ncan\u2019t make us happy but merely give us the equal chance to make\nourselves happy as best we can. They consequently promote general\nhappiness indirectly. And since they are \u201ccorollaries\u201d of\nequal freedom, they are no less indefeasible than the principle of\nequal freedom itself.\n\nBasic moral rights, then, emerge as intuitions too though they are\nmore specific than our generalized intuitive appreciation of the\nutilitarian prowess of equal freedom. Consequently, self-consciously\ninternalizing and refining our intuitive sense of equal freedom,\ntransforming it into a principle of practical reasoning,\nsimultaneously transforms our emerging normative intuitions about the\nsanctity of life and liberty into stringent juridical principles. And\nthis is simply another way of claiming that general utility flourishes\nbest wherever liberal principles are seriously invoked. Moral\nsocieties are happier societies and more vibrant and successful to\nboot.\n\nThough Spencer sometimes labels basic moral rights\n\u201cnatural\u201d rights, we should not be misled, as some\nscholars have been, by this characterization. Spencer\u2019s most\nsustained and systematic discussion of moral rights occurs in the\nconcluding chapter, \u201cThe Great Political Superstition,\u201d of\nThe Man Versus the State (1884). There, he says that basic\nrights are natural in the sense that they valorize\n\u201ccustoms\u201d and \u201cusages\u201d that naturally arise as\na way of ameliorating social friction. Though conventional practices,\nonly very specific rights nevertheless effectively promote human\nwell-being. Only those societies that fortuitously embrace them\nflourish.\n\nRecent scholars have misinterpreted Spencer\u2019s theory rights\nbecause, among other reasons, they have no doubt misunderstood\nSpencer\u2019s motives for writing The Man Versus the State.\nThe essay is a highly polemical protest, in the name of strong rights\nas the best antidote, against the dangers of incremental legislative\nreforms introducing socialism surreptitiously into Britain. Its\nvitriolic, anti-socialist language surely accounts for much of its\nsometimes nasty social Darwinist rhetoric, which is unmatched in\nSpencer\u2019s other writings notwithstanding scattered passages in\nThe Principles of Ethics and in The Principles of\nSociology\n (1876\u201396).[12]\n\nSpencer\u2019s \u201cliberal\u201d utilitarian credentials are\ntherefore compelling as his 1863 exchange of letters with Mill further\ntestifies. Between the 1861 serial publication of\nUtilitarianism in Fraser\u2019s Magazine and its\n1863 publication as a book, Spencer wrote Mill, protesting that Mill\nerroneously implied that he was anti-utilitarian in a footnote near\nthe end of the last chapter, \u201cOf the Connection Between Justice\nand Utility.\u201d Agreeing with Benthamism that happiness is the\n\u201cultimate\u201d end, Spencer firmly disagrees that it should be\nour \u201cproximate\u201d end. He next adds:\n\nBut the view for which I contend is, that Morality properly so-called\n\u2013 the science of right conduct \u2013 has for its object to\ndetermine how and why certain modes of conduct are detrimental, and\ncertain other modes beneficial. These good and bad results cannot be\naccidental, but must be necessary consequences of the constitution of\nthings; and I conceive it to be the business of moral science to\ndeduce, from the laws of life and the conditions of existence, what\nkinds of action necessarily tend to produce happiness, and what kinds\nto produce unhappiness. Having done this, its deductions are to be\nrecognized as laws of conduct; and are to be conformed to irrespective\nof a direct estimation of happiness or misery (Spencer, vol. II, 1904:\n 88\u20139).[13]\n\n\nSpecific types of actions, in short, necessarily always promote\ngeneral utility best over the long term though not always in the\ninterim. While they may not always promote it proximately, they\ninvariably promote it ultimately or, in other words, indirectly. These\naction types constitute uncompromising, normative \u201claws of\nconduct.\u201d As such, they specify the parameters of equal freedom.\nThat is, they constitute our fundamental moral rights. We have moral\nrights to these action types if we have moral rights to anything at\nall.\n\nSpencer as much as Mill, then, advocates indirect utilitarianism by\nfeaturing robust moral rights. For both theorists, rights-oriented\nutilitarianism best fosters general happiness because individuals\nsucceed in making themselves happiest when they develop their mental\nand physical faculties by exercising them as they deem most\nappropriate, which, in turn, requires extensive freedom. But since we\nlive socially, what we practically require is equal freedom suitably\nfleshed out in terms of its moral right corollaries. Moral rights to\nlife and liberty secure our most vital opportunities for making\nourselves as happy as we possibly can. So if Mill remains potently\ngermane because his legacy to contemporary liberal utilitarian still\ninspires, then we should take better account of Spencer than,\nunfortunately, we currently do.\n\nSpencer\u2019s \u201cliberal\u201d utilitarianism, however, differs\nfrom Mill\u2019s in several respects, including principally the\ngreater stringency that Spencer ascribed to moral rights. Indeed, Mill\nregarded this difference as the fundamental one between them. Mill\nresponded to Spencer\u2019s letter professing allegiance to\nutilitarianism, observing that he concurs fully with Spencer that\nutilitarianism must incorporate the \u201cwidest and most general\nprinciples\u201d that it possibly can. However, in contrast to\nSpencer, Mill protests that he \u201ccannot admit that any of these\nprinciples are necessary, or that the practical conclusions which can\nbe drawn from them are even (absolutely) universal\u201d (Duncan,\ned., 1908:\n 108).[14]\n",
