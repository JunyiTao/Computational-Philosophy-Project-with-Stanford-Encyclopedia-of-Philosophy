Applying Hegel\u2019s dialectical method to his arguments\n\nSo far, we have seen how Hegel describes his dialectical method, but\nwe have yet to see how we might read this method into the arguments he\noffers in his works. Scholars often use the first three stages of the\nlogic as the \u201ctextbook example\u201d (Forster 1993: 133) to\nillustrate how Hegel\u2019s dialectical method should be applied to\nhis arguments. The logic begins with the simple and immediate concept\nof pure Being, which is said to illustrate the moment of the\nunderstanding. We can think of Being here as a concept of pure\npresence. It is not mediated by any other concept\u2014or is not\ndefined in relation to any other concept\u2014and so is undetermined\nor has no further determination (EL \u00a786; SL-M 82; SL-dG 59). It\nasserts bare presence, but what that presence is like has no further\ndetermination. Because the thought of pure Being is undetermined and\nso is a pure abstraction, however, it is really no different from the\nassertion of pure negation or the absolutely negative (EL \u00a787).\nIt is therefore equally a Nothing (SL-M 82; SL-dG 59). Being\u2019s\nlack of determination thus leads it to sublate itself and pass into\nthe concept of Nothing (EL \u00a787; SL-M 82; SL-dG 59), which\nillustrates the dialectical moment.\n\nBut if we focus for a moment on the definitions of Being and Nothing\nthemselves, their definitions have the same content. Indeed, both are\nundetermined, so they have the same kind of undefined content. The\nonly difference between them is \u201csomething merely\nmeant\u201d (EL-GSH Remark to \u00a787), namely, that Being is\nan undefined content, taken as or meant to be presence, while Nothing\nis an undefined content, taken as or meant to be absence. The third\nconcept of the logic\u2014which is used to illustrate the speculative\nmoment\u2014unifies the first two moments by capturing the positive\nresult of\u2014or the conclusion that we can draw from\u2014the\nopposition between the first two moments. The concept of Becoming is\nthe thought of an undefined content, taken as presence (Being) and\nthen taken as absence (Nothing), or taken as absence (Nothing) and\nthen taken as presence (Being). To Become is to go from Being to\nNothing or from Nothing to Being, or is, as Hegel puts it, \u201cthe\nimmediate vanishing of the one in the other\u201d (SL-M 83; cf. SL-dG\n60). The contradiction between Being and Nothing thus is not a\nreductio ad absurdum, or does not lead to the rejection of\nboth concepts and hence to nothingness\u2014as Hegel had said\nPlato\u2019s dialectics does (SL-M 55\u20136; SL-dG\n34\u20135)\u2014but leads to a positive result, namely, to the\nintroduction of a new concept\u2014the synthesis\u2014which unifies\nthe two, earlier, opposed concepts.\n\nWe can also use the textbook Being-Nothing-Becoming example to\nillustrate Hegel\u2019s concept of aufheben (to sublate),\nwhich, as we saw, means to cancel (or negate) and to preserve at the\nsame time. Hegel says that the concept of Becoming sublates the\nconcepts of Being and Nothing (SL-M 105; SL-dG 80). Becoming cancels\nor negates Being and Nothing because it is a new concept that replaces\nthe earlier concepts; but it also preserves Being and Nothing because\nit relies on those earlier concepts for its own definition. Indeed, it\nis the first concrete concept in the logic. Unlike Being and Nothing,\nwhich had no definition or determination as concepts themselves and so\nwere merely abstract (SL-M 82\u20133; SL-dG 59\u201360; cf. EL\nAddition to \u00a788), Becoming is a \u201cdeterminate unity\nin which there is both Being and Nothing\u201d (SL-M 105;\ncf. SL-dG 80). Becoming succeeds in having a definition or\ndetermination because it is defined by, or piggy-backs on, the\nconcepts of Being and Nothing.\n\nThis \u201ctextbook\u201d Being-Nothing-Becoming example is closely\nconnected to the traditional idea that Hegel\u2019s dialectics\nfollows a thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern, which, when applied to\nthe logic, means that one concept is introduced as a\n\u201cthesis\u201d or positive concept, which then develops into a\nsecond concept that negates or is opposed to the first or is its\n\u201cantithesis\u201d, which in turn leads to a third concept, the\n\u201csynthesis\u201d, that unifies the first two (see, e.g.,\nMcTaggert 1964 [1910]: 3\u20134; Mure 1950: 302; Stace, 1955 [1924]:\n90\u20133, 125\u20136; Kosek 1972: 243; E. Harris 1983: 93\u20137;\nSinger 1983: 77\u201379). Versions of this interpretation of\nHegel\u2019s dialectics continue to have currency (e.g., Forster\n1993: 131; Stewart 2000: 39, 55; Fritzman 2014: 3\u20135). On this\nreading, Being is the positive moment or thesis, Nothing is the\nnegative moment or antithesis, and Becoming is the moment of\naufheben or synthesis\u2014the concept that cancels and\npreserves, or unifies and combines, Being and Nothing.\n\nWe must be careful, however, not to apply this textbook example too\ndogmatically to the rest of Hegel\u2019s logic or to his dialectical\nmethod more generally (for a classic criticism of the\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis reading of Hegel\u2019s dialectics, see\nMueller 1958). There are other places where this general pattern might\ndescribe some of the transitions from stage to stage, but there are\nmany more places where the development does not seem to fit this\npattern very well. One place where the pattern seems to hold, for\ninstance, is where the Measure (EL \u00a7107)\u2014as the combination\nof Quality and Quantity\u2014transitions into the Measureless (EL\n\u00a7107), which is opposed to it, which then in turn transitions\ninto Essence, which is the unity or combination of the two earlier\nsides (EL \u00a7111). This series of transitions could be said to\nfollow the general pattern captured by the \u201ctextbook\nexample\u201d: Measure would be the moment of the understanding or\nthesis, the Measureless would be the dialectical moment or antithesis,\nand Essence would be the speculative moment or synthesis that unifies\nthe two earlier moments. However, before the transition to Essence\ntakes place, the Measureless itself is redefined as a Measure (EL\n\u00a7109)\u2014undercutting a precise parallel with the textbook\nBeing-Nothing-Becoming example, since the transition from Measure to\nEssence would not follow a Measure-Measureless-Essence pattern, but\nrather a Measure-(Measureless?)-Measure-Essence pattern.\n\nOther sections of Hegel\u2019s philosophy do not fit the triadic,\ntextbook example of Being-Nothing-Becoming at all, as even\ninterpreters who have supported the traditional reading of\nHegel\u2019s dialectics have noted. After using the\nBeing-Nothing-Becoming example to argue that Hegel\u2019s dialectical\nmethod consists of \u201ctriads\u201d whose members \u201care\ncalled the thesis, antithesis, synthesis\u201d (Stace 1955 [1924]:\n93), W.T. Stace, for instance, goes on to warn us that Hegel does not\nsucceed in applying this pattern throughout the philosophical system.\nIt is hard to see, Stace says, how the middle term of some of\nHegel\u2019s triads are the opposites or antitheses of the first\nterm, \u201cand there are even \u2018triads\u2019 which contain\nfour terms!\u201d (Stace 1955 [1924]: 97). As a matter of fact, one\nsection of Hegel\u2019s logic\u2014the section on\nCognition\u2014violates the thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern\nbecause it has only two sub-divisions, rather than three. \u201cThe\ntriad is incomplete\u201d, Stace complains. \u201cThere is no third.\nHegel here abandons the triadic method. Nor is any explanation of his\nhaving done so forthcoming\u201d (Stace 1955 [1924]: 286; cf.\nMcTaggart 1964 [1910]: 292).\n\nInterpreters have offered various solutions to the complaint that\nHegel\u2019s dialectics sometimes seems to violate the triadic form.\nSome scholars apply the triadic form fairly loosely across several\nstages (e.g. Burbidge 1981: 43\u20135; Taylor 1975: 229\u201330).\nOthers have applied Hegel\u2019s triadic method to whole sections of\nhis philosophy, rather than to individual stages. For G.R.G. Mure, for\ninstance, the section on Cognition fits neatly into a triadic,\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis account of dialectics because the whole\nsection is itself the antithesis of the previous section of\nHegel\u2019s logic, the section on Life (Mure 1950: 270). Mure argues\nthat Hegel\u2019s triadic form is easier to discern the more broadly\nwe apply it. \u201cThe triadic form appears on many scales\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cand the larger the scale we consider the more obvious it\nis\u201d (Mure 1950: 302).\n\nScholars who interpret Hegel\u2019s description of dialectics on a\nsmaller scale\u2014as an account of how to get from stage to\nstage\u2014have also tried to explain why some sections seem to\nviolate the triadic form. J.N. Findlay, for instance\u2014who, like\nStace, associates dialectics \u201cwith the triad, or with\ntriplicity\u201d\u2014argues that stages can fit into that\nform in \u201cmore than one sense\u201d (Findlay 1962: 66). The\nfirst sense of triplicity echoes the textbook, Being-Nothing-Becoming\nexample. In a second sense, however, Findlay says, the dialectical\nmoment or \u201ccontradictory breakdown\u201d is not itself a\nseparate stage, or \u201cdoes not count as one of the stages\u201d,\nbut is a transition between opposed, \u201cbut complementary\u201d,\nabstract stages that \u201care developed more or less\nconcurrently\u201d (Findlay 1962: 66). This second sort of triplicity\ncould involve any number of stages: it \u201ccould readily have been\nexpanded into a quadruplicity, a quintuplicity and so forth\u201d\n(Findlay 1962: 66). Still, like Stace, he goes on to complain that\nmany of the transitions in Hegel\u2019s philosophy do not seem to fit\nthe triadic pattern very well. In some triads, the second term is\n\u201cthe direct and obvious contrary of the first\u201d\u2014as in\nthe case of Being and Nothing. In other cases, however, the opposition\nis, as Findlay puts it, \u201cof a much less extreme character\u201d\n(Findlay 1962: 69). In some triads, the third term obviously mediates\nbetween the first two terms. In other cases, however, he says, the\nthird term is just one possible mediator or unity among other possible\nones; and, in yet other cases, \u201cthe reconciling functions of the\nthird member are not at all obvious\u201d (Findlay 1962: 70).\n\nLet us look more closely at one place where the \u201ctextbook\nexample\u201d of Being-Nothing-Becoming does not seem to describe the\ndialectical development of Hegel\u2019s logic very well. In a later\nstage of the logic, the concept of Purpose goes through several\niterations, from Abstract Purpose (EL \u00a7204), to Finite or\nImmediate Purpose (EL \u00a7205), and then through several stages of a\nsyllogism (EL \u00a7206) to Realized Purpose (EL \u00a7210). Abstract\nPurpose is the thought of any kind of purposiveness, where the purpose\nhas not been further determined or defined. It includes not just the\nkinds of purposes that occur in consciousness, such as needs or\ndrives, but also the \u201cinternal purposiveness\u201d or\nteleological view proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle\n(see entry on\n Aristotle;\n EL Remark to \u00a7204), according to which things in the world have\nessences and aim to achieve (or have the purpose of living up to)\ntheir essences. Finite Purpose is the moment in which an Abstract\nPurpose begins to have a determination by fixing on some particular\nmaterial or content through which it will be realized (EL \u00a7205).\nThe Finite Purpose then goes through a process in which it, as the\nUniversality, comes to realize itself as the Purpose over the\nparticular material or content (and hence becomes Realized Purpose) by\npushing out into Particularity, then into Singularity (the syllogism\nU-P-S), and ultimately into \u2018out-thereness,\u2019 or into\nindividual objects out there in the world (EL \u00a7210; cf. Maybee\n2009: 466\u2013493).\n\nHegel\u2019s description of the development of Purpose does not seem\nto fit the textbook Being-Nothing-Becoming example or the\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis model. According to the example and model,\nAbstract Purpose would be the moment of understanding or thesis,\nFinite Purpose would be the dialectical moment or antithesis, and\nRealized Purpose would be the speculative moment or synthesis.\nAlthough Finite Purpose has a different determination from\nAbstract Purpose (it refines the definition of Abstract Purpose), it\nis hard to see how it would qualify as strictly \u201copposed\u201d\nto or as the \u201cantithesis\u201d of Abstract Purpose in the way\nthat Nothing is opposed to or is the antithesis of Being.\n\nThere is an answer, however, to the criticism that many of the\ndeterminations are not \u201copposites\u201d in a strict sense. The\nGerman term that is translated as \u201copposite\u201d in\nHegel\u2019s description of the moments of dialectics (EL\n\u00a7\u00a781, 82)\u2014entgegensetzen\u2014has three root\nwords: setzen (\u201cto posit or set\u201d),\ngegen, (\u201cagainst\u201d), and the prefix ent-,\nwhich indicates that something has entered into a new state. The verb\nentgegensetzen can therefore literally be translated as\n\u201cto set over against\u201d. The\n\u201cengegengesetzte\u201d into which determinations pass,\nthen, do not need to be the strict \u201copposites\u201d of the\nfirst, but can be determinations that are merely \u201cset\nagainst\u201d or are different from the first ones. And the prefix\nent-, which suggests that the first determinations are put\ninto a new state, can be explained by Hegel\u2019s claim that the\nfinite determinations from the moment of understanding sublate (cancel\nbut also preserve) themselves (EL \u00a781): later determinations put\nearlier determinations into a new state by preserving\nthem.\n\nAt the same time, there is a technical sense in which a later\ndetermination would still be the \u201copposite\u201d of the earlier\ndetermination. Since the second determination is different from the\nfirst one, it is the logical negation of the first one, or is\nnot-the-first-determination. If the first determination is\n\u201ce\u201d, for instance, because the new determination is\ndifferent from that one, the new one is \u201cnot-e\u201d (Kosek\n1972: 240). Since Finite Purpose, for instance, has a definition or\ndetermination that is different from the definition that Abstract\nPurpose has, it is not-Abstract-Purpose, or is the negation\nor opposite of Abstract Purpose in that sense. There is therefore a\ntechnical, logical sense in which the second concept or form is the\n\u201copposite\u201d or negation of\u2014or is\n\u201cnot\u201d\u2014the first one\u2014though, again, it need not\nbe the \u201copposite\u201d of the first one in a strict sense.\n\nOther problems remain, however. Because the concept of Realized\nPurpose is defined through a syllogistic process, it is itself the\nproduct of several stages of development (at least four, by my count,\nif Realized Purpose counts as a separate determination), which would\nseem to violate a triadic model. Moreover, the concept of Realized\nPurpose does not, strictly speaking, seem to be the unity or\ncombination of Abstract Purpose and Finite Purpose. Realized Purpose\nis the result of (and so unifies) the syllogistic process of Finite\nPurpose, through which Finite Purpose focuses on and is realized in a\nparticular material or content. Realized Purpose thus seems to be a\ndevelopment of Finite Purpose, rather than a unity or combination of\nAbstract Purpose and Finite Purpose, in the way that Becoming can be\nsaid to be the unity or combination of Being and Nothing.\n\nThese sorts of considerations have led some scholars to interpret\nHegel\u2019s dialectics in a way that is implied by a more literal\nreading of his claim, in the Encyclopaedia Logic, that the\nthree \u201csides\u201d of the form of logic\u2014namely, the\nmoment of understanding, the dialectical moment, and the speculative\nmoment\u2014\u201care moments of each [or every;\njedes] logically-real, that is each [or every;\njedes] concept\u201d (EL Remark to \u00a779; this is an\nalternative translation). The quotation suggests that each\nconcept goes through all three moments of the dialectical\nprocess\u2014a suggestion reinforced by Hegel\u2019s claim, in the\nPhenomenology, that the result of the process of determinate\nnegation is that \u201ca new form has thereby immediately\narisen\u201d (PhG-M \u00a779). According to this interpretation, the\nthree \u201csides\u201d are not three different concepts or forms\nthat are related to one another in a triad\u2014as the textbook\nBeing-Nothing-Becoming example suggests\u2014but rather different\nmomentary sides or \u201cdeterminations\u201d in the life, so to\nspeak, of each concept or form as it transitions to the next\none. The three moments thus involve only two concepts or forms: the\none that comes first, and the one that comes next (examples of\nphilosophers who interpret Hegel\u2019s dialectics in this second way\ninclude Maybee 2009; Priest 1989: 402; Rosen 2014: 122, 132; and\nWinfield 1990: 56).\n\nFor the concept of Being, for example, its moment of understanding is\nits moment of stability, in which it is asserted to be pure presence.\nThis determination is one-sided or restricted however, because, as we\nsaw, it ignores another aspect of Being\u2019s definition, namely,\nthat Being has no content or determination, which is how Being is\ndefined in its dialectical moment. Being thus sublates itself\nbecause the one-sidedness of its moment of understanding undermines\nthat determination and leads to the definition it has in the\ndialectical moment. The speculative moment draws out the implications\nof these moments: it asserts that Being (as pure presence) implies\nnothing. It is also the \u201cunity of the determinations in their\ncomparison [Entgegensetzung]\u201d (EL \u00a782; alternative\ntranslation): since it captures a process from one to the other, it\nincludes Being\u2019s moment of understanding (as pure presence) and\ndialectical moment (as nothing or undetermined), but also\ncompares those two determinations, or sets (-setzen)\nthem up against (-gegen) each other. It even puts Being into\na new state (as the prefix ent- suggests) because the next\nconcept, Nothing, will sublate (cancel and preserve)\nBeing.\n\nThe concept of Nothing also has all three moments. When it is asserted\nto be the speculative result of the concept of Being, it has its\nmoment of understanding or stability: it is Nothing, defined as pure\nabsence, as the absence of determination. But Nothing\u2019s moment\nof understanding is also one-sided or restricted: like Being, Nothing\nis also an undefined content, which is its determination in its\ndialectical moment. Nothing thus sublates itself: since it is\nan undefined content, it is not pure absence after all, but\nhas the same presence that Being did. It is present\nas an undefined content. Nothing thus sublates\nBeing: it replaces (cancels) Being, but also preserves Being insofar\nas it has the same definition (as an undefined content) and presence\nthat Being had. We can picture Being and Nothing like this (the\ncircles have dashed outlines to indicate that, as concepts, they are\neach undefined; cf. Maybee 2009: 51):\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nIn its speculative moment, then, Nothing implies presence or Being,\nwhich is the \u201cunity of the determinations in their comparison\n[Entgegensetzung]\u201d (EL \u00a782; alternative\ntranslation), since it both includes but\u2014as a process\nfrom one to the other\u2014also compares the two earlier\ndeterminations of Nothing, first, as pure absence and, second, as just\nas much presence.\n\nThe dialectical process is driven to the next concept or\nform\u2014Becoming\u2014not by a triadic,\nthesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern, but by the one-sidedness of\nNothing\u2014which leads Nothing to sublate itself\u2014and by the\nimplications of the process so far. Since Being and Nothing have each\nbeen exhaustively analyzed as separate concepts, and since they are\nthe only concepts in play, there is only one way for the dialectical\nprocess to move forward: whatever concept comes next will have to take\naccount of both Being and Nothing at the same time. Moreover, the\nprocess revealed that an undefined content taken to be presence (i.e.,\nBeing) implies Nothing (or absence), and that an undefined content\ntaken to be absence (i.e., Nothing) implies presence (i.e., Being).\nThe next concept, then, takes Being and Nothing together and draws out\nthose implications\u2014namely, that Being implies Nothing, and that\nNothing implies Being. It is therefore Becoming, defined as two\nseparate processes: one in which Being becomes Nothing, and one in\nwhich Nothing becomes Being. We can picture Becoming this way (cf.\nMaybee 2009: 53):\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nIn a similar way, a one-sidedness or restrictedness in the\ndetermination of Finite Purpose together with the implications of\nearlier stages leads to Realized Purpose. In its moment of\nunderstanding, Finite Purpose particularizes into (or presents) its\ncontent as \u201csomething-presupposed\u201d or as a\npre-given object (EL \u00a7205). I go to a restaurant for the purpose\nof having dinner, for instance, and order a salad. My purpose of\nhaving dinner particularizes as a pre-given object\u2014the salad.\nBut this object or particularity\u2014e.g. the salad\u2014is\n\u201cinwardly reflected\u201d (EL \u00a7205): it has its own\ncontent\u2014developed in earlier stages\u2014which the definition\nof Finite Purpose ignores. We can picture Finite Purpose this way:\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nIn the dialectical moment, Finite Purpose is determined by the\npreviously ignored content, or by that other content. The\none-sidedness of Finite Purpose requires the dialectical process to\ncontinue through a series of syllogisms that determines Finite Purpose\nin relation to the ignored content. The first syllogism links the\nFinite Purpose to the first layer of content in the object: the\nPurpose or universality (e.g., dinner) goes through the particularity\n(e.g., the salad) to its content, the singularity (e.g., lettuce as a\ntype of thing)\u2014the syllogism U-P-S (EL \u00a7206). But the\nparticularity (e.g., the salad) is itself a universality or purpose,\n\u201cwhich at the same time is a syllogism within itself [in\nsich]\u201d (EL Remark to \u00a7208; alternative translation),\nin relation to its own content. The salad is a universality/purpose\nthat particularizes as lettuce (as a type of thing) and has its\nsingularity in this lettuce here\u2014a second syllogism, U-P-S.\nThus, the first singularity (e.g., \u201clettuce\u201d as a type of\nthing)\u2014which, in this second syllogism, is the particularity or\nP\u2014\u201cjudges\u201d (EL \u00a7207) or asserts\nthat \u201cU is S\u201d: it says that\n\u201clettuce\u201d as a universality (U) or type of thing is\na singularity (S), or is \u201cthis lettuce here\u201d, for\ninstance. This new singularity (e.g. \u201cthis lettuce here\u201d)\nis itself a combination of subjectivity and objectivity (EL\n\u00a7207): it is an Inner or identifying concept\n(\u201clettuce\u201d) that is in a mutually-defining relationship\n(the circular arrow) with an Outer or out-thereness (\u201cthis\nhere\u201d) as its content. In the speculative moment, Finite Purpose\nis determined by the whole process of development from the moment of\nunderstanding\u2014when it is defined by particularizing into a\npre-given object with a content that it ignores\u2014to its\ndialectical moment\u2014when it is also defined by the previously\nignored content. We can picture the speculative moment of Finite\nPurpose this way:\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nFinite Purpose\u2019s speculative moment leads to Realized Purpose.\nAs soon as Finite Purpose presents all the content, there is a return\nprocess (a series of return arrows) that establishes each layer and\nredefines Finite Purpose as Realized Purpose. The presence of\n\u201cthis lettuce here\u201d establishes the actuality of\n\u201clettuce\u201d as a type of thing (an Actuality is a concept\nthat captures a mutually-defining relationship between an Inner and an\nOuter [EL \u00a7142]), which establishes the \u201csalad\u201d,\nwhich establishes \u201cdinner\u201d as the Realized Purpose over\nthe whole process. We can picture Realized Purpose this way:\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nIf Hegel\u2019s account of dialectics is a general description of the\nlife of each concept or form, then any section can include as many or\nas few stages as the development requires. Instead of trying to\nsqueeze the stages into a triadic form (cf. Solomon 1983: 22)\u2014a\ntechnique Hegel himself rejects (PhG \u00a750; cf.\n section 3)\u2014we\n can see the process as driven by each determination on its own\naccount: what it succeeds in grasping (which allows it to be stable,\nfor a moment of understanding), what it fails to grasp or capture (in\nits dialectical moment), and how it leads (in its speculative moment)\nto a new concept or form that tries to correct for the one-sidedness\nof the moment of understanding. This sort of process might reveal a\nkind of argument that, as Hegel had promised, might produce a\ncomprehensive and exhaustive exploration of every concept, form or\ndetermination in each subject matter, as well as raise dialectics\nabove a haphazard analysis of various philosophical views to the level\nof a genuine science.\n",
