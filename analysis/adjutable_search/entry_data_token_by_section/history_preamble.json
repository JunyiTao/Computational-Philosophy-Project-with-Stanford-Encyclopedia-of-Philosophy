    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of history plays a fundamental role in human thought. It\ninvokes notions of human agency, change, the role of material\ncircumstances in human affairs, and the putative meaning of historical\nevents. It raises the possibility of \u201clearning from\nhistory.\u201d And it suggests the possibility of better\nunderstanding ourselves in the present, by understanding the forces,\nchoices, and circumstances that brought us to our current situation.\nIt is therefore unsurprising that philosophers have sometimes turned\ntheir attention to efforts to examine history itself and the nature of\nhistorical knowledge. These reflections can be grouped together into a\nbody of work called \u201cphilosophy of history.\u201d This work is\nheterogeneous, comprising analyses and arguments of idealists,\npositivists, logicians, theologians, and others, and moving back and\nforth over the divides between European and Anglo-American philosophy,\nand between hermeneutics and positivism.\n\nGiven the plurality of voices within the \u201cphilosophy of\nhistory,\u201d it is impossible to give one definition of the field\nthat suits all these approaches. In fact, it is misleading to imagine\nthat we refer to a single philosophical tradition when we invoke the\nphrase, \u201cphilosophy of history,\u201d because the strands of\nresearch characterized here rarely engage in dialogue with each other.\nStill, we can usefully think of philosophers\u2019 writings about\nhistory as clustering around several large questions, involving\nmetaphysics, hermeneutics, epistemology, and ethics: (1) What does\nhistory consist of\u2014individual actions, social structures,\nperiods and regions, civilizations, large causal processes, divine\nintervention? (2) Does history as a whole have meaning, structure, or\ndirection, beyond the individual events and actions that make it up?\n(3) What is involved in our knowing, representing, and explaining\nhistory? (4) To what extent do facts about human history create moral\nresponsibilities for the present generation?\n",
