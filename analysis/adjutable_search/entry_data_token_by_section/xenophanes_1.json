Criticisms of Greek Popular Religion\n\nFragments B11 and B12 describe, and implicitly criticize, the stories\nabout the gods told by Homer and Hesiod.\n\nHomer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods\n\nall sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among\nmen:\n\ntheft, adultery, and mutual deception. (B11)\n\n\n\u2026as they sang of numerous illicit divine deeds:\n\ntheft, adultery, and mutual deceit. (B12)\n\n\nThe basis for Xenophanes\u2019 unhappiness with the poets\u2019\naccounts is not explained, but we may infer from the concluding call\nto pay due honor to the gods in Xenophanes\u2019 B1 that an\nattribution of scandalous conduct would be incompatible with the\ngoodness or perfection any divine being must be assumed to possess\n(cf. Aristotle Meta. 1072b; Plato, Rep. 379b.)\n\nIn the well-known fragments B14\u201316, Xenophanes comments on the\ngeneral tendency of human beings to conceive of divine beings in human\nform:\n\nBut mortals suppose that gods are born,\n\nwear their own clothers and have a voice and body. (B14)\n\n\nEthiopians say that their gods are snub-nosed and black;\n\nThracians that theirs are are blue-eyed and red-haired. (B16)\n\n\nB15 adds, probably in a satirical vein, that if horses and oxen had\nhands and could draw pictures, their gods would look remarkably like\nhorses and oxen. B17, \u201c\u2026and bacchants of pine stand round\nthe well-built house\u201d may represent a criticism of the common\nancient belief that a god could assume possession of a physical object\nso as to offer protection to its possessor. The ridiculing of\nPythagoras\u2019 claim to have recognized the soul of a departed\nfriend in the voice of a barking dog (B7), together with the attacks\non divination credited to Xenophanes in A52, reflect the broader\ndenial of knowledge of divine attributes and operations set out in\nB34. Xenophanes is prepared to offer a positive account of the nature\nof the deity (see the following section) but his position appears to\nbe that while no mortal being will ever know about the gods with any\ndegree of certainty, we can at least avoid adopting beliefs and\npractices clearly at odds with the special nature any divine being\nmust be assumed to possess.\n",
