    "preamble": "\n\nMargarete Susman stands out as a distinct voice among the first\ngeneration of German women in philosophy in the 20th century. In her\ncapacity as a philosopher, cultural critic, and essayist, she was a\nregular member of the circle of Georg Simmel, which included Martin\nBuber, Ernst Bloch, and Georg Lukacs, among others. Jewish thought and\nthe question of the status and role of women in modern society are the\ntwo central foci of Susman\u2019s critical interest. They guide her\nwork, which examines the challenges modernity poses to culture and\nsociety as it tracks the profound and radical upheavals that define\nthe times of Susman\u2019s life: the Wilhelmine Empire, World War I,\nthe social and political revolutions of Weimar Germany, the rise of\nthe Nazis to power, the Shoah, and the emergence of the new world\nduring the postwar period.\n\nHer pioneering essays on Franz Rosenzweig and Franz Kafka helped\nestablish Susman as a leading thinker of modern Jewish thought. Often\nher work assumes the form of studies of other thinkers or intellectual\nor social movements. These studies are not merely exegetical and\ninterpretative, however, but articulate Susman\u2019s own response to\nthe question of how to deal with the historical constellations of past\nphilosophical thought in the face of the unprecedented exigencies of\nthe present. In them, Susman stakes out a dialogical space for her own\ncritical concerns. She does so by maintaining a reflective receptivity\nwhose explorative openness opposes the tendency to closure informing\nthe style of academic, disciplinary discourse.\n\nAfter authoring two volumes of poetry (an additional early volume had\nappeared as a private edition), Susman went on to produce her first\nmonograph, Das Wesen der modernen deutschen Lyrik (The\nCharacter of Modern German Poetry, 1910), which introduced the\nconcept of the \u201clyrical I\u201d as the key feature in modern\npoetry. Her first philosophical book, Vom Sinn der Liebe\n(Of the Meaning of Love, 1912), is an engaging study of sex,\ngender, and love whose approach to difference and alterity continues\nto command attention. The publication of the book led to a lasting\nfriendship with Gustav Landauer, who wrote an enthusiastic review and\nwhose political ideas Susman shared.\n\nA sample of characteristic essays written over three decades, from the\nearly 1920s to the late 1940s, was published in Gestalten und\nKreise (Figures and Circles, 1954, hereafter GK). The\nessay collection conveys the themes Susman was principally preoccupied\nwith as well as her approach to essay writing. Susman\u2019s Das\nBuch Hiob und das Schicksal des j\u00fcdischen Volkes (The\nBook of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People, 1946) was one\nof the earliest attempts at responding to the catastrophic events of\nthe Shoah and the challenge they posed to the very meaning of being\nJewish after the genocidal annihilation of European Jewry. In this\nbook, Susman argues that, like the Book of Job had suggested, the\nquestion of meaning was ultimately not to be answered by any\nrationalization of human loss and suffering through the invocation of\na grander scheme but was instead to be approached by acknowledging the\nimpossibility of grasping the unfathomable and comprehending meaning\nas the continuous project of human existence whose temporality comes\ninto focus only from the viewpoint of a future yet to be realized.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\nSusman was born on October 14, 1872, in Hamburg, Germany to a\nwell-situated, Jewish, middle-class family. In 1882, the family moved\nto Zurich, Switzerland, where Susman attended primary school and the\ngymnasium. While her father was supportive of her as a poet, arranging\nfor a private publication of a volume of her poetry on the occasion of\nher twentieth birthday, he staunchly opposed her wish to study. In\n1894, after his death, the family returned to Germany to settle in\nHanover. In order to allow Susman to study, her older sister Paula\nassumed sole responsibility for the care of their ailing mother. After\nstudying painting in D\u00fcsseldorf and Paris, Susman began to study\nphilosophy in Munich with Theodor Lipps. She subsequently moved to\nBerlin, where she studied with Georg Simmel, becoming a regular\nparticipant in his after-hours private discussion group. In 1906,\nSusman married a fellow painter, Eduard von Bendemann. Though\ninitially willing to comply with his parents\u2019 request that, as a\ncondition of their marriage, she convert to Christianity, Susman\ndecided the day before her baptism that it was impossible for her to\nabandon Judaism. Her parents-in-law accepted her decision. The same\nyear, Georg Simmel published his book Religion as part of\nMartin Buber\u2019s series Society: Series in\nSocial-Psychological Studies, dedicating it to Susman and Gertrud\nKantorowicz.\n\nFrom 1907 to 1932, she was a regular contributor to the\nFrankfurter Zeitung. During this time, she reviewed new\npublications in literature and philosophy, often with a particular\nfocus on the German-Jewish experience. From 1912 to 1915, she lived\nwith her family in R\u00fcschlikon, near Zurich. The family returned\nto Germany in 1915, first living in Frankfurt and then, beginning in\n1919, living on a farm close to the Swiss border in S\u00e4ckingen on\nthe Rhine. Although inspired by the vision of Gustav Landauer and the\nlife reform movement to move to the countryside to get away from the\npostwar chaos in Frankfurt, the long hours of work on the farm left\nSusman only with the nights for reading (Susman 1964: 96).\n\nSusman\u2019s review of Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s Star of\nRedemption (1921) in Der Jude, Weimar Germany\u2019s\npremier Jewish literary journal, which was published by Buber from\n1916\u20131928, was one of the earliest critical recognitions of the\nsignificance of Rosenzweig\u2019s philosophically critical turn, or\nwhat he called \u201cnew thinking\u201d. Rosenzweig credited Susman\nwith having understood his work like nobody else. In a letter to her,\nresponding to her review, he wrote:\n\n\nThe following will confirm how profoundly you understood the book: the\nline that you chose as motto for your essay I wrote back in November\n18 in completely clear awareness that it is the core and central\nproposition of the whole [book]. (collected in Rosenzweig 1979: volume\n2.1, 752)\n\n\nFrom 1926 to 1935, Susman published her most important essays in the\nbi-monthly journal Der Morgen, which, from 1925\u20131938,\nwas the leading intellectual forum of German Jewry. With the German\nphilosopher Arnold Metzger, Susman read, in 1927, another seminal book\nthat had just left the press and that in her view would compare\nunfavorably to Rosenzweig\u2019s: Heidegger\u2019s Being and\nTime (1927).\n\nIn 1928, the von Bendemanns divorced and Susman moved to Frankfurt\nwhere she stayed until 1933. On New Year\u2019s Eve of 1933, she\nfound herself the only passenger on the night train from Amsterdam to\nZurich; she arrived in Zurich on the morning of the new year and\nremained there until the end of her life, in 1966. In her\nautobiography, she called this chapter of her life \u201cemigration\nhome\u201d. Her last publication in Germany included an essay (1935a)\nexamining Adalbert Stifter\u2019s subliminal antisemitism in his\nnovella Abdias (1842). The essay also appeared as a postface\nto the novella published in the Schocken small book series dedicated\nto Jewish cultural resistance in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. The other\nessay with which she ended a decade of contributing to Der\nMorgen, \u201cOn the Intellectual Contribution of Jews in the\nGerman Region\u201d (\u201cVom geistigen Anteil der Juden im\ndeutschen Raum\u201d, 1935b), was a brief survey of signature\ncontributions to German culture and philosophy from Moses Mendelssohn\nto Franz Kafka. The essay concluded with the suggestion that Jewish\nlife might well have ended in Germany and would perhaps resume one day\nin another corner of the world.\n\nFor Susman, the return to Zurich was more than a homecoming to the\ncity of the formative years of her late childhood and adolescence; it\nwas a return to a place that was becoming a temporary safe haven for\nEurope\u2019s refuges, especially its German speaking emigrant\nintelligentsia. Here, Susman found a new intellectual home in the\nreligious socialist circle of Leonhard Ragaz. Her work appeared in his\njournal Neue Wege from 1935\u20131965. In Zurich, Susman\nalso became the center of a circle of young German and Swiss Jewish\nintellectuals, acting as a mentor to and source of intellectual and\nemotional support for many of its participants, notably the\nphilosophers Michael Landmann, Hermann Levin Goldschmidt, and Jacob\nTaubes.\n\nIn 1946, she published The Book of Job and the Destiny of the\nJewish People. The book was among the first attempts to wrestle\nwith the predicament of how to continue life after Auschwitz. Susman\nreturns to the figure of Job, servant of God, as the paradigmatic\nfigure to reimagine Jewish life after the Shoah. While this book dealt\nwith the challenge to making sense of the Jewish experience,\nInterpretation of a Great Love: Goethe and Charlotte von\nStein (Deutung einer grossen Liebe: Goethe und Charlotte\nStein, 1951) scrutinized the remains of the German state of mind\nby revisiting the twists and turns of the legendary yet conflicted\nlove of Germany\u2019s famed cultural icon, Goethe. Examining the\nprofound but painful and ultimately doomed love affair of the most\nrevered German thinker and artist, Susman shed light on the darker\nsides of the deep-running issues haunting German affective life.\n\nDeutung biblischer Gestalten (Interpretation of Biblical\nFigures, hereafter DBG), which featured essays from the 1930s and\n1940s, came in 1955. Susman, who had gone blind in her final years,\ndictated her last publication, her autobiography Ich habe viele\nLeben gelebt: Erinnerungen (I Have Lived Many Lives:\nMemoirs), published in 1964.\n2. \u201cJudaism and Culture\u201d\n\nIn her first essay, \u201cJudentum und Kultur\u201d (\u201cJudaism\nand Culture\u201d, 1907, hereafter JuK), which was also her first\narticle to appear in Frankfurter Zeitung, Susman offers a\nsuccinct argument for the Jewish tradition\u2019s critical\nsignificance for rethinking modernity as well as philosophy more\ngenerally. Critical of a reductionism that would cast Judaism as\nsimply a form of ethics, she argues that doing so would mean to\nunthinkingly submit to the tripartition of all human endeavors into\nesthetics, logics, and ethics. She suggests that, arbitrary and\nultimately unfeasible, this approach turns a blind eye to what might\nwell be the most fundamental dimension of all human endeavors, the\nreligious one. For Susman, the sphere of the religious constitutes the\nfocal point of all culture; all other forms of producing\nvalue\u2014the ethical, esthetic, and logical ones\u2014gather\naround it as that which grounds their purpose. Ethics, Susman notes,\ncontrary to widely shared views, has never been Judaism\u2019s single\npurpose but the means to pursue its task in history (JuK 1).\n\nWritten in the wake of Simmel\u2019s Religion (1906), which\npainted a vivid picture of the profound role religion continues to\nplay in modern culture and society, \u201cJudentum und Kultur\u201d\nargues against the call for assimilation and for the enduring and\nvital significance of Judaism\u2019s role in modern culture. In an\nearly gesture towards interfaith dialogue, the essay suggests, without\nreferencing Leo Baeck\u2019s argument in The Essence of\nJudaism (1905), that Judaism is not a religion of dogmas, thereby\nadding to Baeck\u2019s argument a striking and unexpected point.\nWestern culture, she notes, rests on Christian foundations that inform\nmodernity, inflecting its deepest longings and desires for redemption.\nTaking off the \u201cstraightjacket\u201d of Christian religion\nwould be tantamount to ripping apart the arteries and pulses of the\nculture\u2014in short, it would amount to a collapse of \u201cour\nwhole culture\u201d. While Christianity, unlike Judaism, has become a\ncompletely universalized religion that envisions human redemption in\npurely universal terms, its history is also\n\n\nan answer the history of humanity offers to the question of whether\nJudaism is free of dogmas and contains a living core.\n\n\nFor Christianity, she observes, \u201coriginated after all from\nJudaism\u201d (JuK 2). This insight constitutes a constant in\nSusman\u2019s thought; it accounts for the way she views the deeper\naffinities between Christianity and Judaism despite the fierce\nantagonism that exists between them, which she at no point denies.\n\nWhile this intuition resonates with Hermann Cohen\u2019s view\nconcerning the intimate embrace the two historical forces continue to\nbe engaged in, the particular way in which Susman sets religion\nsquarely beside ethics, epistemology, and aesthetics as a fourth and\nequally irreducible \u201corientation\u201d of its own anticipates\nthe critical motif that informs Cohen\u2019s Religion Out of the\nSources of Judaism (1919).\n3. The Lyrical I\n\nSusman\u2019s first monograph, Das Wesen der modernen deutschen\nLyrik (The Character of Modern German Poetry, 1910)\nexamines the philosophical significance of modern poetry from Goethe\nto George and Rilke. Tracking the trajectory of the emergence of\nmodern poetry as a distinct art form with its own artistic logics,\nSusman\u2019s treatise presents a critical intervention against\nWilhelm Dilthey\u2019s conception of poetry as a reflection of the\npoet\u2019s authentic experience, i.e., Erlebnis as\ndistinguished from Erfahrung, which is a product of\ndiscursive reasoning. Taking her cue from Simmel\u2019s approach to\nart, Susman attends to poetry\u2019s generative power. Poetry\ngenerates its own forms artistically rather than deriving them from a\npre-existent order of life.\n\nRather than expressing authentic experience, poetry creates with its\ndistinct forms the conditions to create life forms through which\nexperience becomes possible in the first place. The \u201clyrical\nI\u201d, which Susman introduces here, is thus not just a term of\nliterary theory but also has wider philosophical implications.\n\nFor Susman, the \u201clyrical I\u201d is the particular form the\npoet creates with poetry: \u201cthe \u2018lyrical I\u2019 [is] a\nform [\u2026] the poet creates from the given I\u201d (1910: 16).\nIt is different from the poet\u2019s empirical I and not to be\nconfused with subjectivity. Distancing herself from the idea that\npoets express their innermost, authentic selves, Susman highlights the\n\u201cpurely formal character\u201d of the lyrical I that is given\nits symbolic articulation \u201ccompletely independently of its\nindividual and general aspects\u201d (1910: 18). According to Susman\nthe lyrical I is the \u201cexpression\u201d or \u201cform of an\nI\u201d. Like the artwork it retains its formal character completely\nindependent from its individual or general content because it is\ncreated rather than given. In other words, the poet does not find the\nlyrical I in her- or himself but, like \u201cthe speaking and acting\nfigures of a drama, [the poet] first must create the lyrical I out of\nwhat he finds in his given I\u201d (1910: 18).\n\nThe lyrical I is the formative principle of poesis. Its constructive\nrather than mimetic or merely reflective aspect suggests it has\nepistemological consequences for how we conceive ourselves beyond\naesthetics:\n\n\nAmong the forms art produces, the lyrical I is distinguished by being\nthe only form (Gestalt) in an artwork whose contents project\nthe whole scope and extent of the artwork and which alone defines its\nthrust, its world. (1910: 19)\n\n\nThe lyrical I, in other words projects a world view or particular way\nto see and experience the world as a whole. It is however not the\nsubjective representation of an \u201cempirical I\u201d but the\n\u201cobjective form of the I\u201d that the poem contrives (1910:\n19). The lyrical I is, as it were, the esthetic expression of the\nindividual\u2019s unique and irreducible incommensurability in the\nact of symbolic representation: \u201cFor every individual is\nincommensurable in relation to every other\u201d (1910: 21). The\nproject of expressing the singularity of the individual, Susman notes,\nis delivered from the individual\u2019s incommensurability by way of\nsymbolic representation:\n\n\nFor precisely the incommensurable of the individual [des\nIndividuellen], which is the world\u2019s true infinity, is the\ncontent of the symbol. (1910: 21f.)\n\n\nSusman understands the symbol thus as a poetic means of expressing\ndiversity rather than uniform unity. The symbol allows for the\nexpression of the individual\u2019s incommensurability in a language\nin which the word\u2019s fecundity produces the poetic experience.\nPoetry is transformative because it uses language abstractly as well\nas in a concrete manner. This unique combination is for Susman what\ndefines its symbolic use (1910: 23f.). The development of modern\npoetry consists in this process of symbolizing the modern experience,\na process iterated in the articulations of the diversity of lyrical\nI\u2019s it brings forth. As a result, poetry must be understood as\nperforming a philosophically critical task, a task that Susman\ndescribes in terms that can be read as summarizing Simmel\u2019s\nthought succinctly: \u201cForm presents existence for us. To form\nmeans to give the things their existence for us\u201d (1910: 91).\n4. Of the Meaning of Love\n\nVom Sinn der Liebe (Of the Meaning of Love, 1912)\nmarks Susman\u2019s debut as a philosopher. With this monograph,\nSusman enters a field of inquiry hitherto exclusively reserved to men;\nshe responds to this challenge by making love the central subject of\nher investigation. Articulating a metaphysical discourse of her own,\nshe highlights lacunae left by a philosophical discourse determined by\nmale sensitivities. In his essay \u201cThe Relative and the Absolute\nin the Problem of the Sexes\u201d (1911), Simmel had, just a year\nearlier, analyzed the predicament of the discursive silencing of\nwomen, going so far as to cast the understanding of women\u2019s\nconcerns as a sheer cognitive impossibility for the male world (Simmel\n1911 [2001 and 1984]). A theory and metaphysics of love, he noted two\nyears later, in \u201cThe Problem of Fate\u201d (1913), shortly\nafter the publication of Susman\u2019s monograph, was \u201cjust as\nimportant as the theory of knowledge and the metaphysics of\nart\u201d. There, Simmel had wondered where except in the one-sided\nattempts by Plato and Schopenhauer philosophy had in earnest discussed\nthe question of what is love (Simmel 1913 [2001: 483 and 2007: 78]).\nThe dedication of Susman\u2019s book to Simmel\u2019s wife Gertrud\nfurther highlights the philosophical affinity with Simmel and his\nwife. By taking a subject traditionally deemed a women\u2019s issue\nseriously and attending to it in a philosophically comprehensive\nmanner, Susman took charge of a subject that since Augustine had been\nrelegated to the domain of theology and since Kant had become a matter\nof moral philosophy. Neither Kierkegaard nor Nietzsche changed much\nwhen they continued to theorize love from a purely male-defined\nperspective.\n\nSusman\u2019s book presents a critical intervention that shows that\nlove is not just a fundamental, formative force in human life but\ndeserves comprehensive theoretical attention. In making love the\nsubject of, and prism for, philosophical exploration, Susman\nreimagines philosophical discourse as a more inclusive practice of\nthinking which opens direct lines of inquiry into the exigencies and\nexistential sensibilities of the time. Inspired by the new forms of\nphilosophical investigations initiated by Simmel and Henri Bergson,\nwhose German translation of Introduction to Metaphysics by\nSusman was published in 1909 by arrangement of Simmel, Susman argues\nthe exploration of the question of the status of women and gender must\nbe metaphysically central to, or constitutive of, a philosophy that\nwishes to live up to the claim of inclusive universalism.\n\nIn Part 1, Susman highlights how love is not only a force that arises\nfrom the individual but the power that produces the individual in the\nfirst place.\n\n\nLove arises from life\u2019s great darkness as the longing for form,\na longing that forces ever higher forms up to the human individual in\nwhich it experiences its victory over death, leading beyond life into\neternity. (1912: 20)\n\n\nEmbedded in the dynamics of the forces of life, love is a primordial\nlife force that precedes but also informs the process of\nindividuation. It defies conceptual grasp as its roots reach deeper\nthan the sphere of the mind. While love eludes the firm grasp of the\nconcept, it opens our eyes to the profound alterity of the other. Love\nand alterity are intimately intertwined and produce aporetic tension:\nHow to reconcile alterity, construed as a condition for love, with the\ndesire for union? Susman describes the paradoxical nature of love this\nway:\n\n\nLove is to suffer being Other [Anderssein] and to more\nprofoundly suffer being One [Einssein]\u2014and its eternal\ndemand is to reconcile the being Other with the being One. (1912:\n33)\n\n\nThe very union of souls would destroy precisely the individuation that\nmakes each the love object of the other (1912: 45). Love\n\n\ncan never grasp the essence of the Other because their essence cannot\nbe experienced under the category of form. Where there is essence\nthere is form no longer. (1912: 44)\n\n\nAs a result, the You emerges as that which remains out of reach (1912:\n51f.). Love can only approximately represent the Other through\nsymbolizations that reflect the Other\u2019s life and actions. The\nincommensurability of the You, moreover, is what facilitates our\nindividuation. All of this implies that love is not in itself an\nultimate answer to anything, but it is the relationship that can\neither confuse or clarify our relationship with everything. Even the\ndeepest kind of love cannot provide us with the ultimate meaning of\nour lives, but love is what makes the meaning of our lives legible\n(1912: 49). Susman\u2019s ideas presciently articulate critical\nconcerns that return in the work of Buber and Levinas. Buber\u2019s\nI and Thou (1923) offers a strikingly similar description of\nthe deep paradoxical structure of the otherness of self and other\nwhile Levinas\u2019s insistence on the unbridgeable difference\nbetween myself and a structure of alterity constitutive for human\nexistence shares its metaphysical and phenomenological concerns with\nSusman.\n\nIn Part 2 of the book, Susman plumbs the tragic dimension of love that\nin modern life assumes a new form. No longer \u201cthe pure tragic of\nan incursion of an absolute into life\u201d that it had been taken to\nbe in the past, the tragedy of love in the modern world consists in\nthe fact that the very force of love for the singular drives object\nand desire increasingly further apart (1912: 81):\n\n\nOnly in infinity are the parallel ascending flames permitted to touch\neach other\u2014there where they no longer feel each other. (1912:\n82)\n\n\nWhile Tristan and Isolde, who together constitute the purest prototype\nof the past\u2019s conception of love, are a reminder of love\u2019s\nabsolute and all-consuming power, the individuated, modern soul\nsuffers from the metaphysical loneliness that love so painfully\ninflicts (1912: 83).\n\nBesides this individuating aspect of love, there is love\u2019s\nsexual aspect (geschlechtliche Bestimmtheit, 1912: 84), which\nSusman explores in Part 3. An appreciation of the nexus between love\nand sexuality is fundamental for a deeper understanding of the human\ncondition. The notion of das Geschlechtliche includes,\nbesides sexuality, with its sensual, affective, and animal aspects,\nall that exists and drives us while remaining below the threshold of\nconsciousness: everything which exceeds the life of the conscious mind\nand even that which extends to the depths of the conditions of life\nand its reproductive arrangements:\n\n\nIn the duality of its sexuality (das Geschlecht) the human\nbeing, to whom life serves, had to become subject to life. (1912:\n87)\n\n\nHumanity\u2019s attempts at denial and suppression through askesis\nhave only highlighted the fundamental inseparability of\nGeschlecht and love (1912: 93).\n\nPart 4 examines how the difference of Geschlecht sets the\nsexes apart in more ways than simply with regard to sexuality. As\nSusman argues, this difference is rooted in the depths of the\n\u201cblind life\u2019s\u201d interference with individual life\n(1912: 105). The law of begetting and birthing structures the lives of\nmen and women in profoundly different ways. Man\u2019s relation to\nobjectivity and tendency to posit values above and beyond himself,\nSusman suggests, is oriented to the outside, or what stands apart. Man\nas a creating, constructing being is outside-oriented, while woman\nreturns to herself, taking the world back into herself. Motherhood and\nher maternal dimension structure how woman relates to the world,\ndefining both genders in ways that complement each other. Susman,\nherself a young mother who had given birth to her son Erwin in 1907,\nhighlights the limitations of both genders which set them apart from\none another. The world according to man, she argues, requires a\nradical rethinking from woman\u2019s perspective. Unlike romantic\naccounts of birth-giving and motherhood that celebrate human\nreproduction as a higher transcendental goal while reinforcing\nconventional patterns of gender roles, Susman\u2019s does not suggest\nthat woman has a more direct and immediate link to life and reality.\nShe has neither an ontological advantage over man, nor an ontological\ndisadvantage: the difference between men and women is just that:\nalterity rather than one-sided inadequacy.\n\nWomen, then, have no less access to the metaphysical than men, though\nthe kind of access they have is distinct: it is different from and\ncomplements, rather than falls short of, the access that men have.\nSusman suggests that, for better or for worse, both sexes depend on\neach other in every aspect of their existence. Their relationship is\nthus based on a reciprocally complementary difference whose divisive\nforce makes the experience of love profoundly different for each.\nWhile the act of love might unite them, birth not only forms the new\nunit of a family but causes differences between woman and man to\nproliferate.\n\nAs Susman notes, rather than an unproblematic dyad of mother and\nchild, the woman finds in pregnancy and birth \u201cthe Other, the\nAlien, Life\u201d (1912: 109). Rather than pure bliss, motherhood is\na difficult and conflicted experience: the woman finds her life\nentangled with another being\u2019s life, but, once she gives birth,\nthis life is no longer hers but one she has to allow to be its own\n(1912: 110). Susman argues a resolute departure from a\nChristian-inflected discourse on birthing, motherhood, and family. Her\nmove to demythologize motherhood and expose the strange and\nchallenging experiences that come with it discards the theologically\ncommitted register of sacredness and transcendence, replacing it with\na metaphysics of life that is pointedly immanent. Her disenchanted\napproach to motherhood, which operates as a critique of traditional\nnotions of gender roles, resonates with Derrida\u2019s exposure of\nthe assumed wholesomeness and sanctity of the mother-child relation as\nprofoundly problematic (Derrida, Circumfessions).\n\nWhile man\u2019s life, akin to a Promethean seeker and bringer of\nlight, involves creation and a kind of destruction that respects no\nform, woman\u2019s life is, in keeping with her nature, embedded in\nthe world of matter and becoming; her destiny forms her as\nlife\u2019s immediate hold on her asserts its power. Man, on the\nother hand, is, in keeping with his nature, intractable to the\nprocesses of life (1912: 115). Contra the intellectuality of past\nperiods that consistently excluded women from producing culture (1912:\n122), and in spite of seeming to position women beyond the cultural by\naligning them with the world of nature, matter, and becoming, Susman\nreclaims for women a life of the mind of their own, one that does not\nsubmit to and that is not assimilated by the male world. \u201cIn a\nculture built by men but realized and maintained by women\u201d\n(1912: 125), the destiny of women cannot be to submit \u201cas slave\nwhere she is supposed to be helping mother\u201d (1912: 124). For, in\na world where women are subject to men, they cannot realize the\nmission of their particular calling (1912: 128).\n\nIt is in art, this part of the book concludes, that love is given the\nclarity of expression to which life can only aspire. It is art\u2019s\npower of symbolization that is able to give form to the reconciliation\nof love and the \u201cdark dynamics of matter to which we are\nbound\u201d, a reconciliation completed through life itself (1912:\n129):\n\n\nWhere religion and philosophy have failed us, where they both have\nlost grasp of this dark, confused matter as something alien art alone\nhas shown us a fluctuating, quivering image of a possible\nreconciliation and exaltation. (1912: 136)\n\n\nIt is this image of love that guides us as we look for a way of\nresolving the profound tension that informs our existence. Through\nart\u2019s mediation, we can achieve what religion and philosophy\ncannot: we can\n\n\nthink that man and woman unite in an enhanced life in order to create\na culture that can only come into being by both grasping themselves\nand each other and what can become of both together. (1912: 137)\n\n\nAchieving this, Susman argues, will involve renegotiating rather than\ndestroying what separates men and women. She articulates this vision\nof humanity as one in which both women and men become more human; the\nculture that emerges from this humanity will be \u201ccompletely\ndoubly gendered (zwiegeschlechtlich)\u201d (1912: 137).\n\nGenuine love, Susman concludes, is only symbolized in the love of an\nindividual which points to the greater human destiny of love as the\nbond that sustains humanity as a whole; love in this sense of the word\nrequires the full and undiminished participation of women in their\nirreducible individuality. Susman\u2019s book thus argues that\nphilosophy can no longer afford to exclude women as philosophers from\nits discourse because women bring to thought what men are not able to\naddress, demonstrating in the process how such inclusion contributes\nto a genuine advance in philosophy. As feminist discourse becomes\nestablished in the wake of World War I, Susman\u2019s approach to the\nissue of the status of women continues to develop. The issue of the\nrelation between the genders remains one of the two focal points of\nher critical agenda, the other one being the question of the place of\nJewish thought and tradition in modernity.\n5. Spinoza and the Jewish Disposition vis-\u00e0-vis the World\n\nHer first strictly philosophical essay, as Susman understood it, was\ndedicated to Spinoza, who, in her view, was modern Judaism\u2019s\n\u201conly unique personality of truly creative magnitude\u201d as\nshe had noted in \u201cJudaism and Culture\u201d in 1907 (JuK 2).\n\u201cSpinoza und das j\u00fcdische Weltgef\u00fchl\u201d\n(\u201cSpinoza and the Jewish Disposition vis-\u00e0-vis the\nWorld\u201d, 1913) appeared in the anthology Vom Judentum,\nedited by the Jewish Student Association Bar Kochba in Prague. Susman\nwas the only contributing woman author.\n\nFor Susman, Spinoza represents the \u201ctype of the pure\nmetaphysician\u201d (1913: 53) whose philosophical approach reflects\nthe basic disposition of Jewish tradition in metaphysically refined\nterms. As she reconstructs Spinoza\u2019s central metaphysical\nargument, she argues that we can only get to the heart of\nSpinoza\u2019s thought if we recognize the deeper religious\ndisposition vis-\u00e0-vis the world (Weltgef\u00fchl) that\nguides his metaphysics (1913: 57). It is precisely this deeper\nreaching disposition that informs Spinoza\u2019s thought and allows\nit to move beyond a merely rationalist outlook. In Spinoza, the\nmetaphysical God gives way to the religious God at precisely the point\nwhere the nexus of the world extends beyond the human mind. At this\npoint for the first time the world is truly connected to the human\nbeing and their action. While the purely logical nexus of the world\ndoes not allow for the transition to the living human soul, this\ntransition becomes possible for Spinoza because of the particular way\nhe conceives of immanence as the dynamics of God\u2019s internal\nforce of infinite self-love. This turn of the divine world against\nitself eventually becomes active affect (1913: 58). This point of the\nturning of the world against itself, Susman notes, is what we call\nself-consciousness, which in turn coincides with God\u2019s\nconsciousness. The soul and its form of adequate knowledge rest on\nGod\u2019s self-affection extending to the dynamics of the\nincreasing, active affect that leads to the blissful joy that relates\nsolely to God and his law. This holy joy Spinoza calls the\nintellectual love of God (1913: 59).\n\nIn Spinoza, Susman notes, love is the turning of life onto itself, and\nas such God\u2019s acting on himself. This emphatic notion of love as\nmetaphysical concept is grounded in an idea Susman attributes to\nSpinoza: that self-consciousness \u201cis nothing else than the\nknowledge of the soul in the light of eternity, the knowledge of its\nessence in God\u201d. As a result, self-consciousness \u201ccan only\nact (wirken) and thus become actual (wirklich) by\nway of love\u201d (1913: 59). As Susman observes, \u201cone of the\ntwo great forms of human love shines out here from Spinoza\u2019s\nsystem\u201d (1913: 59). This is the kind of love that does not\nsurrender like that of the mystics but is empowering and\nself-enhancing (1913: 60). Rather than subjecting the soul to a\nheteronomous rule, this form of love understands itself to be the only\nfreedom of the soul. In sharp distinction to the notion of freedom in\nKant and Fichte, Spinoza\u2019s is like Moses\u2019 legislation in\ncontrast to Prometheus\u2019 deed (1913: 60). Spinoza\u2019s notion\nof freedom does not mean liberation from the law of the world but\nrather to grasp in ever more conscious way its sway. The more we\nunderstand our actions to be merely expression of the nature of things\nthe freer we are. We are not free to know what we wish but only to\ngrasp the nexus of things by way of thinking. Our free will does not\nconsist in arbitrariness but in grasping through our actions the\ninterconnection of the divine law (1913: 61). Since all processes in\nnature occur in God, the form of inner consequence\n(M\u00fcssen) replaces the ought (Sollen), i.e., a\nform of an inner urge, or love, as the human being is oriented towards\nthe idea of things, i.e., is truly human. As Susman notes:\n\n\nTo depend on God\u2019s law is nothing else but being determined by a\ncomprehensive being, by a universal law that is at the same time\nimmanent in me. (1913: 62)\n\n\nSusman goes on to distinguish two kinds of dispositions\nvis-\u00e0-vis the world, the Jewish and the Indian, including its\nGreek Dionysian and German mystical variations, in order to situate\nSpinoza more pointedly in the Jewish tradition. While Jewish thought,\nshe argues, subordinates everything to the idea, Indo-Germanic thought\nsubordinates everything to the I. Both world views have the question\nof redemption as their point of departure and both emerge from a\nreligious foundation. The one crystalizes early on into a sharp\ndualism, the other into the first great philosophy of identity. While\nthe Indian disposition elevates the self and its quest for freedom to\nthe center of its striving, the Jewish, with God at its center,\nprivileges law, obligation, and faith as its fundamental values. For\nSusman, however, law is mediated by love bound to a you.\n\n\nFor all love arises originally from the dualist disposition\nvis-\u00e0-vis the world. The thought of mediation is\nhumanity\u2019s proper thought of love. (1913: 67)\n\n\nIts redemptive force, as Susman notes, generates the Messianic idea\n(1913: 67). With this excursus, Susman returns to Spinoza, whose\nsystem of identity appears to exclude this kind of love. Nonetheless,\nshe argues, Spinoza is as different from the Indian disposition as it\nis from Judaism. His notion of self-preservation is the very opposite\nof self-interest; instead, it is \u201crecognition of one\u2019s own\nessence in and through God\u201d (1913: 69). This form of\nself-preservation is only realized by love of God: \u201cFor I am not\nseeking myself in [this love of God] but God\u2019s law in\nmyself\u201d (1913: 69). The identity of the world is thus produced\nby love as the mediating force between the human being and God, the\ndynamic moment of divine infinity that creates the true connection\nbetween I and God (1913: 69f.).\n\nSusman\u2019s essay is a pointed intervention in the lasting\ncontroversy around the place of Spinoza in the history of philosophy\nas well as in Judaism and suggestively argues for his thought\u2019s\nenduring significance in highlighting the constitutive role love plays\nin his system. Offering a provocative way of distinguishing two\nopposed metaphysical dispositions, Susman challenges the dominant\nnarrative that yokes Western philosophy to a Greco-Christian legacy.\nShe highlights the specifically Jewish moment that informs an\nalternative tradition of metaphysical thinking and argues for an inner\ntension that pits two different religious worldviews against each\nother, a tension she will go on to present in her work as a tension\nconstitutive of the modern world.\n6. Homelessness, Exile, Hope, and Redemption\n\nSusman\u2019s insistence on the underlying role of religion for\nunderstanding metaphysics and the task of philosophical inquiry as\nwell as modern life more generally remains constant. Her analysis of\nthe modern condition recognizes the philosophical necessity of\nunderstanding the religious dimension of the experience of modernity.\nInformed by a post-secular sensibility, Susman views the religious\ndimension as determinative of the grounds from which metaphysics\narises. For Susman, philosophy must therefore include the practice of\naddressing the significance of its own theological-political\ncommitments.\n\nFor Susman, homelessness, alienation, exile, hope, and redemption are\nmore than terms that help us articulate the loss, failures, and the\naspirations that inform the modern experience. They also demonstrate\nthat we can only grasp the predicament of modern existence if we are\nwilling to scrutinize it by sourcing the critical potential that the\nbiblical tradition offers. Like Hermann Cohen, Buber, and Rosenzweig,\nwho likewise have recourse to the \u201csources of Judaism\u201d\n(Cohen 1919) in order to examine the predicament of modern existence,\nSusman finds in the Jewish tradition a vital resource.\n\nThe primordial condition in which humans find themselves is\ncharacterized by homelessness and suffering. Facing the infinitude of\nthe world as the finite beings that we are, we experience the world as\nover against us and strange. The certainty of our future death reminds\nus that we are something other than the world:\n\n\nAnd in this being other [Anderssein] we at the same time\ngrasp our deepest particularity [unser tiefstes Eigenes].\nWhat we humans actually are we are by way of our homelessness in the\nworld: through our death and through the knowledge of our impending\ndeath. Human life is per se existence in an alien world and as such\nsuffering. (\u201cDas Judentum als Weltreligion\u201d\n[\u201cJudaism: A World Religion\u201d], 1932 [GF 105] [RPE 74])\n\n\nThe need to face this condition \u201cshared by all humans of all\ntimes and places\u201d is what gives rise to religion in general\n(ibid.).\n\nTen years later, in the middle of WWII and facing the ravaging effects\nof the Shoa, Susman notes that the Jewish plight only reflects in the\nextreme what has become the universal human condition as that of\nhomelessness of the human being on earth, a life in exile; Jewish\nexistence intensifies this condition into an \u201cexile in\nexile\u201d, scattered among all other nations, \u201cthe only\npeople without a land, state, and power\u201d (\u201cEzechiel der\nProphet der Umkehr\u201d, [\u201cEzekiel: The Prophet of\nReturn\u201d] 1942, DBG 73f. [RPE 109 f.]). The diasporic existence\nof the Jewish people has become a reminder that the modern human\ncondition has become quintessentially diasporic. As Susman observes in\n\u201cDas Hiob-Problem bei Franz Kafka\u201d (\u201cThe Question of\nJob in Franz Kafka\u201d, 1929: 45 [RPE 67]): \u201cWe are\nabsolutely and entirely in exile\u201d. Not only does the Jewish\npeople lack its own country, state, and political power, but its mode\nof existence suggests the obsolescence of conventional political\nwisdom, a vision that aligns with Landauer\u2019s and also has\nrecourse to the prophetic tradition. The stubborn and categorical\nresistance to instrumental reasoning lodged in this thought suggests\nthat philosophy that turns a deaf ear to creaturely laments and human\nsuffering does not live up to its claims of universal truth.\nPhilosophical thinking that is attuned to suffering is, to\nSusman\u2019s mind, on the other hand, receptive enough to address\nthe existential need for hope and redemption. Rather than authorizing\nsome cordoned-off philosophy of religion to cater to this need,\nthough, Susman alters philosophy\u2019s approach so that hope can be\nrecognized from within philosophy as a legitimate category crucial for\nthe emancipatory task of thought. But it is the recourse to prophecy,\nSusman maintains, that has first created the notion of world history\nin the proper sense as its vision attends to the undying dream of the\nhuman heart to illuminate the whole of human history (\u201cDie\nFriedensbotschaft der Propheten\u201d, [DBG 134]). As Susman argues,\nthe promise of the prophets lies ahead of us:\n\n\nWe have no need of new prophets [\u2026] Every word of the prophets\nof old Israel goes straight to the truth of our time as if it had been\nspoken just now. (\u201cDie messianische Idee als Friedensidee\u201d\n[\u201cThe Messianic Idea as the Idea of Peace\u201d] 1929 [GF\n61])\n\n\nThe messianic idea of world peace, this great vision of the prophets,\nhints at the way religious thought informs the very core of\nmodernity\u2019s aspirations without rendering that core a mere\ntheological affair. The messianic vision of a united and peaceful\nhumanity situated in a pure futurity at the end of time may seem\nunreasonable and ungrounded, but that is Susman\u2019s point:\n\u201cThe messianic hope is hope without a foundation\u201d\n(\u201cDie Messianische Idee als Friedensidee\u201d, GF 59). Susman\nsuggests that, rather than being exclusively reason-based, the\nMessianic idea of peace presents a genuinely universal form of\nthinking because it takes its cue from a paradoxical structure that\nenvisions the universal as reflecting its own particularity in a way\nthat mirrors the paradox of human existence on Earth (GF 60):\n\u201cthe overpowering law of God and the ultimate depths of the\nhuman heart are nothing that is separated\u201d (\u201cJudentum als\nWeltreligion\u201d, GF 121 [RPE 87]). While resonating with a\nKierkegaardian sense of paradox, Susman is here signaling closer\naffiliation with the Jewish strand of dialogical thinking of Buber and\nRosenzweig. When universal thinking launches off from this starting\npoint, the impossible can become its liberating force. Working in a\ndifferent register, Susman conveys this thought of the impossible in\nthe following way:\n\n\nFor it is part of the human beings that they are unable to stand on\nthemselves, that they cannot be their own ground to stand on; they\ncannot determine their own above or below entirely according to\nthemselves. Only in the stars above do they recognize the grounds\nunder their feet, do they measure their above and below.\n(\u201cWandlungen der Frau\u201d, 1933 [hereafter WF] [GK 174])\n\n7. The Emancipation of Women and the Question of Gender Relations\n\nWhile Susman\u2019s approach to gender and the status of women in\nmodern culture and society had initially been framed in Of the\nMeaning of Love (1912), which was discussed in section 3, above,\nher thinking on these subjects developed during WWI, the Weimar\nRepublic, and afterwards, in their wake, as the debate on gender and\nwomen underwent radical changes. Starting with \u201cDie Revolution\nund die Frau\u201d (1918 [NFF 117\u2013128]), a number of essays reflect\nher increasing attention to the political dimension of these concerns,\nwhose particular cultural implications she further explores in\nFrauen der Romantik (Women of the Romantic Period,\n1929) and Deutung einer grossen Liebe: Goethe und Charlotte von\nStein (Interpretation of a Great Love: Goethe and Charlotte\nvon Stein, 1951).\n\nSusman mounts her critique of the muting of the female voice on an\nanalysis of the image of domesticated woman that male culture has\ncreated and reinforced over the centuries. First formulated in Of\nthe Meaning of Love, Susman\u2019s analysis of the symbolical\nrepresentation of women as a form of domination is now brought into\nsharper focus as a \u201cstruggle about language and image\u201d\n(\u201cFrauenproblem\u201d, 1926: 432). For Susman, the decisive\nresponse to the crisis of the time consists in women taking back and\nowning their own image: \u201cThe tough struggle between man\u2019s\nimage of the woman and of woman herself\u201d is \u201cthe whole\nproblem of woman\u201d (1926: 433). This work, which, according to\nSusman, will ultimately determine the success of women\u2019s\nmovement, involves the renegotiation of the symbolic representation of\nthe role and place of women in culture and society.\n\nFrauen der Romantik examines the lives of five German women,\ntracking the untold story of the women\u2019s perspective of a\nliterary movement that claimed to be all about love but cast women as\nultimately uncreative but fortunate beneficiaries of male fantasy. A\nperceptive critique of Romanticism\u2019s necrophiliac tendencies,\nwhose renewal Susman witnessed under the banner of the rise of\nreactionary forces in Weimar Germany, the study also examined the\nundercurrents of religious difference under whose sign the prominent\nJewish Romantics Dorothea von Schlegel (Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s\noldest daughter) and Rahel Varnhagen sought to find their own way,\nalbeit in an often palpably restricted fashion. Similarly, Deutung\neiner grossen Liebe seeks to present a great albeit often\nconflicted dialogue between Goethe and the woman who became his\nguiding star, a relationship that was profoundly affected by the way\nthe feminine gender role determined the lives of the even most\ncreative and independent minds.\n\nSusman views the rising up of women in the context of two other\nrevolutions: the proletarian and the sexual revolution:\n\n\n[T]his is the third revolution of our world: the woman who enters as\nindependent human being with her own problems and own reality the\nhitherto exclusively male world. (\u201cM\u00e4chte im\nWeltgeschehen\u201d, hereafter MW, 654; see also\n\u201cAufl\u00f6sung und Werden in unserer Zeit\u201d [Dissolution\nand Becoming in Our Age], 1928, hereafter AW, 342 and 348)\n\n\nIn order to comprehend the full ramifications of women\u2019s\nrevolution, Susman points out, we need to understand it as part of the\nprofound sea change that these three revolutions bring about\ntogether.\n\nSusman sees this liberation as something of a Pyrrhic victory, one\nthat comes at the cost of the radical, destabilizing loss of all\ntraditionally-valued certainties (AW 347). She casts the situation\ndryly:\n\n\nWhen finally almost overnight the doors opened to the desired world\nthis took place in the most tremendous collapse. It turned out: man\nhad no world at all to offer to woman; all his orders and laws had\ndisintegrated. (WF 1933 [GK 161])\n\n\nIt is not just that marriage and motherhood along with traditional\nideas of femininity had been dissolved, but that the question\n\u201cwhere is the world that a mother can offer her child?\u201d no\nlonger had an answer (GK 165). As women experience cataclysmic\ndevelopments of these kinds more profoundly and more existentially\nthan men, it is up to women to be leaders during these processes of\ncultural transition (GK 174). The task, as Susman understands it, is\nnot for women to cease being women, but, on the contrary, to take back\nand appropriate \u201cmale existence in order to achieve full female\nhumanity\u201d (GK 175). Woman, then, \u201cmust not only recognize,\nunderstand, and love man\u2014she must in order to grasp his life\nreally become man\u201d (GK 175). In other words, woman, according to\nSusman, has to fully own the world even though\u2014and\nbecause\u2014it has been defined by man and has excluded her for\nmillennia. Only a full and radical appropriation of maleness, she\nsuggests, will render the transformation of woman into a new,\nself-determined female possible, and this transformation has already\nbegun (GK 176). As she notes elsewhere:\n\n\nIn the mind of the most modest and uneducated ordinary workingwoman\nstill lives today a greater and deeper dream of life than in the most\nsignificant man of our world completely dedicated to matter of facts\nand work. (MW 654)\n\n\nWorld War 1 and the social and political revolutions that followed\nbrought about a fundamental change in inter-human relationships:\n\u201cthe old forms of love are dead\u201d (WF 1933 [GK 173]). The\ntime-honored conventions of binding the \u201cworld powers\u201d\nlove and sex into culturally stable forms through the mediating power\nof Eros have become obsolete and there are no non-anachronistic\nconceptions of woman and gender relations to turn to. The contemporary\nwoman has become metaphysically homeless (WF 1933 [GK 163], \u201cDas\nFrauenproblem in der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Welt\u201d, 146 and 151 and\nMW). For Susman, this is the most formidable challenge: women are\nforced to imagine themselves anew in a world marked by radical change.\nIn this time of transition, they must create themselves by reimagining\nlove and sex through an engagement with Eros of an unprecedented form\n(WF 1933 [GK 173]; \u201cDas Frauenproblem\u201d, and MW). In 1933,\non the eve of the demise of the Weimar Republic, Susman writes that\nthe women\u2019s movement no longer exists in its original form,\nhaving transformed into the common project shared by women and men\nalike to bring about a human renewal. In a changed world this no\nlonger means submission to the design of a male vision: \u201cMen\ndesign the ways; women walk them. It is her way to walk the way\nherself\u201d (WF 1933 [GK 177]).\n8. Interpretative Studies: Gestalten und Kreise\n\nIn 1954, Susman published a collection of essays she had written in\nthe period from 1921 to 1953. The anthology, titled Gestalten und\nKreise (Figures and Circles), features interpretative\nstudies on Jewish authors such as Moses Mendelssohn, Freud, Bergson,\nFranz Rosenzweig, Franz Kafka, and Karl Wolfskehl. The volume also\nincluded studies on other authors, such as Goethe and Nietzsche, as\nwell as essays on Chassidism, Women\u2019s Emancipation, and\nAnarchism. The essays exemplify Susman\u2019s approach to doing\nphilosophy, or her way of working, philosophically, by means of\nexploring the paradigmatic significance of historical constellations.\nHer method is a kind of deep reading focusing on how authors and their\ntexts negotiate the challenges of the historical moment in which they\nlive and write, and which they have come to exemplify. The book as a\nwhole, Susman notes in her preface, is \u201can attempt to offer with\nthe demise of an old world an entry point to a new one\u201d (GK\n5).\n\nUnlike Dilthey\u2014Simmel\u2019s \u201cantipode\u201d (Ich\nhabe viele Leben gelebt, 1964: 65)\u2014Susman stays close to\nSimmel in interpreting individuals and intellectual movements in their\nhistorical context. While Susman feels historical configurations\ndeserve our utmost appreciation, she does not take them to exude the\nkind of normative validity that Dilthey\u2019s approach suggests they\ndo. For her, \u201cthe act of understanding is itself temporal,\nhistorical\u201d; the\n\n\nunity it creates is nothing more than the life of an ephemeral moment.\nAnd yet, all our truth and the entire relationship of our time to our\neternity rests on this moment. (AW 352)\n\n\nInformed by an approach to death that resonates with\nRosenzweig\u2019s Star of Redemption, Simmel\u2019s\nLebensanschauung (Views of Life 1918), and Heidegger\u2019s\nBeing and Time (whose approach considering death initially\ntakes its cue from Simmel), Susman views human mortality as that which\ninforms human sense-making, which, as a project, is defined by its own\ntemporality (AW 352 and 336\u201338). Her approach dovetails here\nwith Rosenzweig, whose thought limns death as the marker of the\nfinitude that enables human existence\u2019s forward-looking\nviewpoint \u201cinto life\u201d (Ins Leben, the concluding\ntwo words of Rosenzweig\u2019s Star of Redemption). This\nforward-looking perspective oriented towards life that takes death as\nlife\u2019s point of departure rather than its end allows for an\nunderstanding of temporality and meaning pointedly opposed to the\norientation towards death guiding Heidegger (\u201cFranz\nRosenzweig\u201d, 1930 [GK 297\u201398]).\n\nSusman first highlighted the significance and innovative impetus of\nRosenzweig\u2019s Star of Redemption in a review essay\nentitled \u201cDer Exodus aus der Philosophie\u201d (\u201cThe\nExodus from Philosophy\u201d) that appeared only months after the\nbook\u2019s publication. A month later, in a review of the book\npublished in Der Jude (1922), she offered a more detailed\ndiscussion, which led to Rosenzweig\u2019s enthusiastic response\n (quoted above in Section 1).\n Nine years later, in the wake of Rosenzweig\u2019s death, Susman\ngave the first comprehensive account of Rosenzweig\u2019s\nintellectual legacy (\u201cFranz Rosenzweig\u201d, 1930). Over two\ndecades later, in Gestalten und Kreise, she revisited\nRosenzweig\u2019s life and thought as one of the great testimonies of\nJewish history (GK 311). For Susman, Rosenzweig\u2019s magnum opus is\nan avowal or profession (Bekenntnis, GK 296); it is more than\nmere knowledge (Erkenntnis). For Rosenzweig, the question of\nphilosophy is no longer \u201cwhat is?\u201d but is instead that of\nthe \u201cwhole, living and dying human\u201d whose concern is:\n\u201cWhere is a truth that can redeem me?\u201d (GK 298). The\nconsternation this book produced was based, Susman observed, on the\nradical turn in thinking caused by the thinker\u2019s return or\nteshuva (Umkehr, GK 302). It is the particular and\ncreative combination of Jewish and German thought that gives rise to a\nnew thinking that reimagines the project of philosophy at the\ninterface of faith and knowledge as a task committed to attending to\nthe existential exigencies of life.\n\n\u201cMoses Mendelssohn and His Decision\u201d first appeared in\n1932; it appeared in revised form in 1946. Both dates indicate\nhistorical watersheds bookending the beginning and end of Nazi\npersecution and the demise of Jewish life in central Europe, along\nwith the end of the prolific period of German Jewish culture that had\nbegun with Mendelssohn,\n\n\nthe beginning of the famous salons of the Romantic period\u2014and\nhence the beginning of German intellectual sociability in general. (GK\n269)\n\n\nMore than his writing, Susman suggests, Mendelssohn\u2019s life\nexemplified the decision to embrace German culture and the project of\nEnlightenment in whose creation he played a crucial role. By embracing\nmodernity while solidly grounded in the Jewish tradition (whose first\nmodern representative he would become), he courageously set out to\njustify his commitment to both as a choice. Mendelssohn\u2019s\ndecision to live as a modern individual who celebrates Judaism by\nchoice answered Lavater\u2019s challenge to explain how he could\nremain Jewish and at the same time be a modern citizen of the world.\nMendelssohn\u2019s decision, however, put the burden on the\nindividual to justify adherence to Judaism in terms of an individual\nchoice rather than by belonging to the communal reality of a people.\nIn the wake of the Shoah, Mendelssohn may thus only appear as a figure\nof a world that has come to its tragic end. However, Susman argues,\nMendelssohn\u2019s choice is a vision that points beyond what, in the\nmiddle of the twentieth century, could only be seen as a cataclysmic\nend. Challenging hindsight analyses that cast Mendelssohn\u2019s\ntrajectory as opportunistically reformist at best and a calamitous\nbetrayal of Jewish tradition at worst, Susman instead highlights how\nMendelssohn\u2019s predicament ultimately represents and adumbrates\nthe challenges each Jew continues to face today.\n\nGestalten und Kreise concludes with a lightly edited version\nof \u201cDas Hiob-Problem bei Franz Kafka\u201d (\u201cThe Problem\nof Job in Franz Kafka\u201d, 1929), the first Kafka interpretation\nattending to the role of Jewish tradition in his writing.\n\n\nThis is in what consists the so strange, so profoundly religiously\nharrowing of Kafka\u2019s world removed from God: this world is not\nseen from the perspective of the world, from life, it is seen from the\nperspective of God, the law, measured and judged according to it.\n[\u2026] The presentation of his God-forsaken world, immersed into\nnothing in its whole painful and sinister truth is ultimately nothing\nelse but the presentation of his messianic longing. (GK 364;\ntranslated RPE 69)\n\n\nBenjamin and Scholem\u2019s Kafka interpretations follow\nSusman\u2019s discussion in often quasi-verbatim ways. The concluding\naphorism of Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia (1951, itself\nmodelled on Adorno\u2019s reading of Kafka) bears a striking\nresemblance to the epistemologically critical gesture that informs\nSusman\u2019s Kafka interpretation.\n\nWhile universal in outlook and range, Gestalten und Kreise\ncarries a distinctly Jewish note that underscores the\ninterconnectedness of philosophical and Jewish themes in\nSusman\u2019s approach.\n\nEmbracing interpretation as sense-making, Susman practices an\nexplicitly receptive, dialogical form of doing philosophy and writing;\nher writing, for instance, negotiates the relationship between the\nuniversal and particular through its performative dimensions as it\nproceeds. Making this receptivity a generative feature of her writing\nand thinking, Gestalten und Kreise exemplifies this\nparticular mode of Susman\u2019s writing, which might well be\nconsidered Susman\u2019s particular form of \u00e9criture\nf\u00e9minine.\n9. The Book of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People\n\nSusman\u2019s response to the murder of millions of Jews and the\nannihilation of German and most of European Jewry belongs to the\nearliest attempts to comprehend the abyss of the catastrophe often, at\nleast since the 1980s, referred to as the Holocaust or Shoah. The\nBook of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People, published first\nin 1946 and in a second edition in 1948, with a preface addressing the\nfoundation of the State of Israel, is a meditation on the disastrous\nattempt at the extermination of the Jewish people. This catastrophic\nevent posed a radical challenge to the question of how to respond to\nthe project of philosophy. Along with the responses of Horkheimer,\nAdorno, Buber (whose Eclipse of God, published 1952 is a\nreply, as it were, to, Horkheimer\u2019s Eclipse of Reason,\npublished in 1947 and both intially given as lectures at Columbia\nUniversity), Levinas, and Sartre, Susman\u2019s intervention marks a\ndecisive turn in rethinking philosophy. As Susman notes in the\nconcluding pages of her book, the problem of the Shoah is not just a\nconcern for the Jews but is deeply connected to the problem of\nhumanity:\n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of man, there is no solution to the Jewish problem\njust as there is no solution to the human problem; the Jewish problem\nis inseparably linked to the human problem, it is the problem of being\nhuman itself as it is posed in its ultimate depth. (1946 [1948:\n216])\n\n\nWorking through the \u201cJewish problem\u201d was not merely the\nresponsibility of the theologians, Susman\u2019s recourse to the Book\nof Job suggests, but was equally the task of philosophy, whose\nsoundness could only be proven by the way it lived up to the task of\nfacing its most radical challenge. Though Susman\u2019s reading of\nthe historical situation humanity faced in the wake of Auschwitz has\nrecourse to the biblical Book of Job, the study is in fact a\nmetaphysical meditation. While it is true that Susman does not shy\naway from the discourse of religion, the book\u2019s argument remains\nstaunchly non-theological. Susman actually follows the biblical text\nin its resolute criticism of all theological discourse. In her essay\non Kafka from 1929, Susman had already treated Job\u2019s as the\nparadigmatic experience for exploring the Jewish dimension of\nKafka\u2019s world. In this essay, she noted that\n\n\nJudaism\u2019s entire destiny of suffering in exile is prefigured in\nthe destiny of Job who God has surrendered in his suffering to the\nTempter. (\u201cThe Problem of Job in Kafka\u201d 35; GK 352; RPE\n58)\n\n\nCarefully navigating the exigencies of theology and philosophy, Susman\nrelies on the genre of the ancient wisdom literature instantiated by\nthe Book of Job to set her argument, an argument that grounds reason\nin the task of addressing the experience of suffering and loss of\nmeaning, making the realization of this task the linchpin of\nthought\u2019s veracity. The distinction between philosophy and\nJewish philosophy (with its attendant subordination of \u201cJewish\nPhilosophy\u201d, or articulation of the latter as a derivative\nsubdiscipline with no epistemological standing) is thus rejected as\nthe book\u2019s act of mourning the six million innocent victims of\nthe Shoah brings the metaphysical tensions such a distinction obscures\ninto the open. Operating between modern philosophy\u2019s turning a\nblind eye on the question of God and theology\u2019s no less\nproblematic appropriation of the name of God, Susman follows the Book\nof Job in its fundamental redefinition of the hermeneutic situation\nthrough a reversal of Job\u2019s perspective. Job\u2019s relentless\nquestioning of God does not lead to an answer; it eventually leads,\ninstead, to a change on the part of our understanding of God, who,\nassuming, in the eyes of Job, the role of querier, comes to pose the\nquestions Job is unable to answer. God reveals himself only by turning\nthe hermeneutic situation around and into a dialogical situation that\nthwarts discursive certainty and shows itself to be irreducible to the\nlanguage which deploys philosophical or theological concepts. That is,\nGod is revealed in a dialogical experience whose truth is realized in\nthe moment of the human recognition of the limit of understanding.\nMeaning itself is the result of this dialogical relationship, which\nsuggests our response to the latter is the ultimate task of human\nexistence.\n\nIf it is no longer possible to define God, then this is true for\nJewish people and non-Jewish people alike. The closure of this\npossibility corresponds, for Susman, to a closure of the possibility\nof defining humanity itself:\n\n\n[W]e have lost not just the image of the Jewish human being but also\nthe image of the human being in general; the name human being is today\nno less legible than the name of God. (1946 [1948: 151])\n\n\nThese losses and the unspeakable atrocities experienced during the\nShoah are entwined, and only an \u201cunlimited, indelible\nmourning\u201d, Susman tells us, can be the answer to what happened\nin the ovens of the concentration camps (1946 [1948: 208]). Susman\nwas, in fact, one of the earliest thinkers to formulate the injunction\nto never forget the atrocities committed by the German people. This\ninjunction to reset philosophy anew is later repeated by Adorno and\nFackenheim. Susman formulates it the following way:\n\n\nNothing of all that has been experienced by Jewish people on German\nterritory, from German hands, or guided by them must be forgotten;\nthis is the stern legacy of the victims to the survivors. (1946 [1948:\n208])\n\n\nRather than yielding a fixation on the past that would lead only to a\nform of victimization, Job\u2019s experience points the way to a\ntransformative turn, a change in comprehension ultimately irreducible\nto religiosity. At the bottom of this change of mind is a new reliance\non one\u2019s own understanding of reason, the result of the\ndialogical encounter with the unfathomable from which hope arises as a\nmessianic promise. It can arise precisely because messianic hope is\nnot bound to the past; it is dependent, instead, on the way we work\nthrough it. Job is not given any explanation for his suffering by God;\nit remains inexplicable, but he learns to recognize that the\nunfathomable only determines him through how he responds to it. He\nacknowledges that\n\n\nhis part is not to grasp and understand [das Begreifen] but\nto live out of the unfathomable [aus dem Unbegreiflichen].\n(1946 [1948: 178])\n\n\nThe challenge of the survivors of the Shoah is thus not only never to\nforget but to create new life in the face of this past. The messianic\nis not a speculative end of history but the vantage point here and now\nthat opens history up at any given point if we are prepared to reject\nthe conceptual blinkers of theological and teleological thinking. This\nis what gives the messianic its empowering force. The argument here\nhas a remarkable affinity with ideas articulated in Walter\nBenjamin\u2019s \u201cOn the Concept of History\u201d, a text\nwhich, though written in 1939/1940, reached its first readers initially\nhectographed in 1942 in a limited edition, and did not appear until\n1950 in print in German.\n10. Legacy\n\nOne of the first women distinguished as a philosopher and public\nintellectual in Wilhelmine and Weimar Germany as well as in\nSwitzerland (her home in early adolescence and her home again after\n1933) and a prominent exponent of German Jewish intellectual life\nduring the time of the Jewish Renaissance, Susman played an important\nrole in the literary circles of Stefan George and Karl Wolfskehl. She\nwas also a close associate of Georg Simmel and facilitated his\nreception after 1945 with her collaboration on the first edition of a\ncollection of his selected essays, titled Br\u00fccke und\nT\u00fcr, and her monograph Die geistige Gestalt Georg\nSimmels (Georg Simmel\u2019s Intellectual Contour). A\ndistinct voice among philosophers and intellectuals during the\nWilhelmine and Weimar periods, Susman became a symbol of the endurance\nof the legacy of German Jewish thought after 1945. Her thought both\nanticipated and left a formative imprint on the writings of Buber,\nBloch, Benjamin, Scholem, Adorno, Jacob Taubes, Hermann Levin\nGoldschmidt, and others.\n",
