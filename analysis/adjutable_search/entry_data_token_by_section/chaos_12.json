Interacting Systems\n\nThe failure to find the features of classical chaos in quantum systems\nis usually diagnosed as being due to the linear nature of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation (classical chaos appears to require\nnonlinearity as a necessary condition). And the evidence from isolated\nquantum systems substantiates this diagnosis as just discussed. What\nabout interacting quantum systems (which sometimes get called open\nquantum systems)? At first glance, one can argue that the linearity of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation implies that nearby quantum states\nwill always remain nearby as they evolve in time. However, some\nalternative possibilities for possible chaotic behavior have been\nproposed for interacting quantum systems.\n\n\nFred Kronz (1998, 2000) has argued that focusing on the\nseparable/nonseparable Hamiltonian distinction is more appropriate\nthan nonlinearity for the question of quantum chaos\n(1.2.7 Taking Stock above). Although\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation is linear, there are many examples\nof nonseparable Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. A prime example\nwould be the Hamiltonian describing an interaction between a\nmeasurement device and a quantum system. In such situations, the\nquantum system-measurement apparatus compound system can evolve from a\ntensor product state to a nonseparable entangled state represented by\nan irreducible superposition of tensor product states. A second\nubiquitous example would be the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\ncorrelations. Although many, such as Robert Hilborn (1994, 549\u2013569),\nhave argued that the unitary evolution of quantum systems makes SDIC\nimpossible for quantum mechanics, these arguments do not take into\naccount that interacting quantum systems typically have nonseparable\nHamiltonians.\n\n\nFor interacting quantum systems, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation is no\nlonger valid and one typically turns to so-called master equations to\ndescribe evolution (Davies 1976). Such equations typically have\nnonseparable Hamiltonians. In general, the time evolution of the\ncomponents of such interacting systems is not unitary meaning that there is\nno formal prohibition against SDIC. Moreover, an important contrast between\nisolated and interacting quantum systems is that while the former have discrete\nenergy spectra, the latter have continuous spectra. A continuous\nenergy spectrum is characteristic of classical systems. Nevertheless,\nwork in interacting quantum systems largely has only uncovered the same kinds of\nuniversal statistical characteristics of energy spectra and\nfluctuations as found in isolated systems (e.g., Guhr,\nM\u00fcller-Groeling and Weidenm\u00fcller 1998; Ponomarenko, et\nal. 2008; Filikhin, Matinyan and Vlahovic 2011).\n\n\nIt is often the case that the quantum chaology literature uses a\nbroader notion of chaos as behavior that \u201ccannot be described as\na superposition of independent one-dimensional motions\u201d\n(Ponomarenko, et al. 2008, p. 357); in other words, a form of\ninseparability. Still, the chaology in interacting quantum systems looks to\nbe the same as in isolated systems: \u201cQuantum mechanically, chaotic\nsystems are characterized by distinctive statistics of their energy\nlevels, which must comply with one of the Gaussian random ensembles,\nin contrast to the level statistics for the nonchaotic systems\ndescribed by the Poisson distribution\u201d (Ponomarenko, et al.\n2008, p. 357). This is largely due to the fact that quantum chaology\nis closely tied to universal statistical patterns in quantum systems\nthat share some relationship with classical chaotic counterpart\nsystems.\n\n\nOne of the measures used to detect chaotic behavior in classical\nsystems is a positive Kolmogorov entropy, which can be related to\nLyapunov exponents (e.g., Atmanspacher and Scheingraber\n1987). Unfortunately, there are no appropriate analogous for Lyapunov\nexponents in quantum systems. There are alternative entropy measures\nthat could be used, for instance, the von Neumann or\nConnes-Narnhofer-Thirring entropies. However, there are currently many\nopen questions about which, if any, of these entropy measures is the\nappropriate quantum analog (likely they are each appropriate for\nparticular research purposes). Moreover, while these measures have a\nrelationship to the statistics of energy levels and states\ncharacteristic of quantum chaology, there currently are no other known\nfeatures of quantum systems that these measures could relate to\nchaotic behavior observed in classical trajectories.\n\n\nThere is an interesting physical model of a charged particle in a unit\nsquare with periodic boundary conditions with an external\nelectromagnetic field that occasionally gives it a kick (turns on and\noff). Mathematically this model is a generalization of the quantized\nArnold cat map (Arnold and Avez 1968; Weigert 1990; Weigert\n1993). Physically it represents a charged particle confined to an\nenergy surface shaped like a torus that receives kicks from an\nexternal field. The classical model has trajectories that exhibit the\nstretching and folding process that seems to be a necessary condition\nfor chaos, has positive Lyapunov exponents, and is algorithmically\ncomplex[12], one\nof the measures used to detect classical chaos. Its trajectories have\nmany of the marks of chaos. For the quantum model, the kick of the\nelectromagnetic field has the effect of mapping the quantum labels of\nstate vectors that are initially close together to labels which do not\nnecessarily ever come close again. This is somewhat reminiscent of the\ndivergence of classical chaotic trajectories except that it is the\nchange in the state labels that plays the role of the classical\ntrajectories. This leads to an absolutely continuous quasi-energy\nspectrum (the quasi-energy is defined as the set of numbers\nrepresenting the \u201cenergy\u201d in the evolution operator acting on state\nvector labels). The expectation value of the particle position becomes\nunpredictable with respect to the initial state label after long times\nand one can show that the sequence of shifts of the quantum state\nlabels is algorithmically complex. Moreover, a \u201cdistance\u201d\nbetween the labels can be defined that increases exponentially with\ntime.\n\n\nThis is the most convincing example in quantum chaology of behavior\nanalogous to classical chaos. However, there are issues that raise\nquestions about whether the behavior of the sequences of quantum state\nlabels is enough to qualify the system as chaotic. For one thing, the\nquantum chaos conjecture is inapplicable to this system due to the\ncontinuous spectrum of the quasi-energy. More importantly, as pointed\nabout above, exponential divergence is neither necessary nor\nsufficient to characterize a system as chaotic, and neither is\nalgorithmic complexity. There are many examples of systems that are\nalgorithmically complex but are not chaotic. Long randomly generated\nbit strings, no matter how they were obtained, are algorithmically\ncomplex but need not have any relationship to chaos. The behavior of\nthe quantum labels for the kicked particle is irregular to be sure,\nbut the actual temporal evolution of the state vectors is\nalgorithmically compressible, so not irregular in any way.\n\n",
