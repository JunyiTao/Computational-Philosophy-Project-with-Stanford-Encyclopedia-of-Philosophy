    "main_text": "\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead (1863\u20131931), American philosopher and social\ntheorist, is often classed with William James, Charles Sanders Peirce,\nand John Dewey as one of the most significant figures in classical\nAmerican pragmatism. Dewey referred to Mead as \u201ca seminal mind\nof the very first order\u201d (Dewey, 1932, xl). Yet by the middle of\nthe twentieth-century, Mead\u2019s prestige was greatest outside of\nprofessional philosophical circles. He is considered by many to be the\nfather of the school of Symbolic Interactionism in sociology and\nsocial psychology, although he did not use this nomenclature. Perhaps\nMead\u2019s principal influence in philosophical circles occurred as\na result of his friendship with John Dewey. There is little question\nthat Mead and Dewey had an enduring influence on each other, with Mead\ncontributing an original theory of the development of the self through\ncommunication. This theory has in recent years played a central role\nin the work of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. While Mead is best known for his\nwork on the nature of the self and intersubjectivity, he also\ndeveloped a theory of action, and a metaphysics or philosophy of\nnature that emphasizes emergence and temporality, in which the past\nand future are viewed through the lens of the present. Although the\nextent of Mead\u2019s reach is considerable, he never published a\nmonograph in philosophy. His most famous work, Mind, Self, and\nSociety: From the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist, was\npublished after his death and is a compilation of student notes and\nselections from unpublished manuscripts.\n",
