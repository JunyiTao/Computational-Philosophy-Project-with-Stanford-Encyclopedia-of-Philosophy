    "main_text": "Objections to Expected Utility Theory || Maximizing Expected Utility is Impossible\n3.1 Maximizing Expected Utility is Impossible\n\n\nOught implies can, but is it humanly possible to maximize expected\nutility?  March and Simon (1958) point out that in order to compute\nexpected utilities, an agent needs a dauntingly complex understanding\nof the available acts, the possible outcomes, and the values of those\noutcomes, and that choosing the best act is much more demanding than\nchoosing an act that is merely good enough.  Similar points appear in\nLindblom (1959), Feldman (2006), and Smith (2010).\n\n\nMcGee (1991) argues that maximizing expected utility is not\nmathematically possible even for an ideal computer with limitless\nmemory.  In order to maximize expected utility, we would have to\naccept any bet we were offered on the truths of arithmetic, and reject\nany bet we were offered on false sentences in the language of\narithmetic.  But arithmetic is undecidable, so no Turing machine can\ndetermine whether a given arithmetical sentence is true or false.\n\n\nOne response to these difficulties is the\n bounded rationality approach, which\naims to replace expected utility theory with some more tractable\nrules.  Another is to argue that the demands of expected utility\ntheory are more tractable than they appear (Burch-Brown 2014; see also\nGreaves 2016), or that the relevant \u201cought implies can\u201d\nprinciple is false (Srinivasan 2015).\n",
