This book offers an extensive description of the author\u2019s\ntheoretical doctrine. Forming the basis of this doctrine and the\nframework for the rest of his formulations are his principles of\nfaith, which attempt to define the beliefs that are the necessary\nfundamentals of a system of laws whose source is the divine. Before we\nexamine the various philosophical views incorporated within this book,\nwe will offer a concise description of its structure, stylistic\ncharacteristics, and goals.\n\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim is composed of a preface, which\nincludes a highly detailed table of contents; an introduction; and\nfour treatises divided into chapters. Although Albo completed writing\nthe book around 1425, scholars have long agreed that before the book\nwas published in its entirety, a preliminary version appeared,\ncomprising the first of the four treatises (Back 1869, 8\u201310;\nT\u00e4nzer 1896, 19\u201322, 27; Schweid 1967, 25).\n\n\nIn the first treatise of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, Albo\npresents in detail his theory of principles and the various issues it\nincludes. Albo points out several problems with the lists of\nprinciples of faith proposed by his predecessors. In particular, he\nchallenges Maimonides\u2019 list of thirteen principles of faith,\nproposing in their place a concise list numbering only three basic\nbeliefs.  Absent these beliefs, Albo believes that divine law has no\nexistence or significance: 1) the existence of God, 2) the divine\norigin of the Torah, and 3) reward and punishment. This list\ndetermines the structure of the entire book, since the following three\ntreatises address each one of the three principles in turn. The main\ntopic of the second treatise is the existence of God, and it discusses\nthe theory of divinity, especially the theory of divine\nattributes. The third treatise, whose main topic is the divine origin\nof the Torah, covers the issues of human perfection, general prophecy,\nand Mosaic prophecy and law. It concludes with a thorough discussion\nof the religious emotions of fear and love of God. The fourth and last\ntreatise, whose main subject is reward and punishment, divides into\ntwo sections. The first section describes the theory of divine\nprovidence, the problem of evil and the significance of the precepts\nof prayer and repentance. The second section in the fourth treatise\nspeaks of the theory of recompense, emphasizing that of the world to\ncome. We should note here that Albo\u2019s theory of principles also\nincludes additional components.  Each one of the principles\nnecessarily leads to further beliefs, which he calls\n\u201croots,\u201d and these in turn lead to a third level of less\nimportant beliefs, which he calls \u201cbranches.\u201d\n\n\nThe language of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim is straightforward, and its\nphilosophical arguments are formulated in a relatively simple and\nclear manner. These characteristics mean that a broad audience of\nreaders can approach this philosophical work on their\nown. Furthermore, the modern reader can rely on Albo\u2019s clear\nformulations to gain a preliminary acquaintance with many of the\nphilosophical viewpoints offered in the general framework of medieval\nJewish philosophy.\n\n\nAn additional stylistic aspect of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim touches\ndirectly on the body of his theory. The book includes a number of\ninternal contradictions on a wide variety of philosophical issues.\nThis fact has led most scholars to the conclusion that this is an\neclectic work, lacking originality and vision, at a low philosophical\nlevel (Guttmann 1955; Guttmann 1964, 247\u2013251; Ravitzky 1988,\n104\u2013105). Yet recent scholars have proposed a new angle of\nperception on the significance of these internal contradictions,\nidentifying in Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim an esoteric writing style\nsimilar to that of Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the\nPerplexed. According to this viewpoint, the internal\ncontradictions are not the result of lack of attention on the part of\nan eclectic and average philosopher who combined various sources\nwithout regard to the differences between them. On the contrary, they\nbelieve these contradictions demonstrate meticulous attention on the\npart of the philosopher. The maverick position claims that Albo\nintentionally embedded in his book conflicting opinions in order to\nhide his true viewpoint on various theological issues from certain\ngroups of readers. Among other evidence, this research position relies\non Albo\u2019s explicit statement in the introductory comment to the second\ntreatise (Schwartz 2002, 183\u2013196; Ehrlich 2009a).\n\n\nMost scholars assume that we should understand Albo\u2019s goal in\nwriting Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim against the\nbackground of the historical reality in which he lived. As indicated,\nthe book was written as an attempt to address the severe social and\nreligious distress of the Jews of Christian Spain in the late\nfourteenth \u2013 early fifteenth centuries. In the framework of this\napproach, we may discern two different goals that the book intends to\nserve.\n\nSocial goal \u2013to offer a rationalist\napologetic for Judaism alongside a refutation of the doctrines of\nChristianity, with the aim of limiting the phenomenon of conversion and\nthe spiritual decline of the Jews of Christian Spain at that time\n(Husik 1928\u201330, 62\u201365).\n\n\nTheoretical goal \u2013 to redefine the\nprinciples of Judaism and discuss its theoretical relation to\nphilosophy, in light of the intensification of internal arguments on\nthese issues within Jewish thought during the period discussed (Back\n1869, 5\u20136; Lerner 2000, 90\u201395).\n\n\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim was first published in 1485 as one of the\nfirst works of Jewish philosophy to reach the printing press. The book\nmade a considerable impact throughout the fifteenth century, with\nrenowned Jewish philosophers citing it and contending with its\nideas. Among them we may name such personalities as Isaac Arama,\nAbraham Bibago and Isaac Abravanel. From the sixteenth to the\neighteenth centuries, his thought continued to engage Jewish and\nnon-Jewish philosophers, including Baruch Spinoza, Moses Mendelssohn,\nand several Christian theologians. During this period, two authors\nwrote commentaries on Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim: Jacob Koppelman\n(Ohel Ya\u2018akov, Freiburg 1584) and Gedaliah Lipschitz (Etz\nShatul, Venice 1618). In addition, the book was translated into\nLatin, German, English and Russian, and its first treatise was\ntranslated into Italian. In 1929, Isaac Husik published a critical\nedition of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, including his translation of\nthe book into English, an introduction, and detailed notes and indices\n(Albo 1929).\n\n\nBefore taking up our discussion of Albo\u2019s thought, we must point out a\nsignificant methodological problem that this discussion entails. On\nthe one hand, the common opinion in the literature on Albo estimates\nthat he was not an original philosopher at all, and that the body of\nhis book merely summarizes the various approaches he knew from the\nworks of the Jewish philosophers that preceded him. This theory, in\nits extreme version, argues that even the theory of principles, the\nmain reason for his book\u2019s renown, is not Albo\u2019s unique creation. In\ncontrast, a more recent trend in research on Albo\u2019s work identifies\nclear characteristics of esoteric writing in his book. This theory\ninterprets the conflicting opinions on the issues in the book as\nbelonging to two separate layers of writing \u2013 the external,\nexoteric layer, and the inner, esoteric layer. In many cases, these\ntwo research approaches lead to differing opinions regarding the\nquestion of Albo\u2019s independent philosophical positions.\n\n\nBecause of this, the overview below will present the central issues\naddressed in Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim with a faithful reflection of\nthe state of present research on Albo\u2019s philosophy. At the same time,\nwe will refrain from categorizing his various philosophical\nviews. This essay will discuss Albo\u2019s theories of: (1) law, (2)\nprinciples, (3) divinity, (4) humanity, and (5) providence and\nrecompense.\n",
