    "main_text": "Cosmology\n4. Cosmology\n\nAlthough Heraclitus is more than a cosmologist, he does offer a\ncosmology. His most fundamental statement on cosmology is found in\nB30:\n\nThis world-order [kosmos], the same of all, no god nor man\ndid create, but it ever was and is and will be: everliving fire,\nkindling in measures and being quenched in measures.\n\n\nIn this passage, he uses, for the first time in any extant Greek text,\nthe word kosmos \u201corder\u201d to mean something like\n\u201cworld.\u201d He identifies the world with fire, but goes on to\nspecify portions of fire that are kindling and being quenched.\nAlthough ancient sources, including Aristotle (On the Heavens\n279b12\u201317) as well as the Stoics, attributed to Heraclitus a\nworld that was periodically destroyed by fire and then reborn, the\npresent statement seems to contradict that view, as Hegel already\nnoticed. If the world always was and is and will be, then it does not\nperish and come back into existence, though portions of it (measures\nof fire) are constantly being transformed. \n\nHeraclitus describes the transformations of elementary bodies:\n\nThe turnings of fire: first sea, and of sea half is earth, half\nfireburst. (B31[a])\n\n\n<Earth> is liquefied as sea and measured into the same\nproportion as it had before it became earth. (B31[b])\n\n\nFire turns into water (\u201csea\u201d), and then half of that\nquantity turns into earth and half into \u201cfireburst\u201d\n(pr\u00east\u00ear, a fiery, windy kind of storm\nphenomenon). The portion that becomes earth turns back into water, in\nthe same quantity it had previously. Here Heraclitus envisages a\nlawlike transformation of stuff from fire to water to earth; the\ntransformation is reversible, and in it the same relative quantities\nof stuff are preserved. There is, then, a kind of conservation of\nmatter, or at least overall quantity of matter. What would make the\nworld to be continuous would be the fact that when one portion of fire\nturns into water, an equivalent portion of water turns into fire. The\noverall equilibrium is preserved, even if the water that is now in the\nsea is not the same water as was in it before. This picture bears a\nsimilarity to the image of the river, which remains the same despite\nits changing material contents. \n\nIn this view of the world, the mutual transformations of matter are\nnot an accidental feature, but the very essence of nature. Without\nchange, there would be no world. Heraclitus seems to acknowledge this\nin his praise of war and strife:\n\nWe must recognize that war is common, strife is justice, and all\nthings happen according to strife and necessity. (B80)\n\n\nWar is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods,\nsome as men; some he made slaves, some free. (B53)\n\n\nConflicting powers of opposites, including those of elemental bodies,\nmake possible the world and all its variety; without that conflict we\nwould have only lifeless uniformity. In the former passage Heraclitus\nis perhaps criticizing Anaximander for his view that cosmic justice\nconsists of a punishment of powers that overstep their boundaries\n(Anaximander B1). Justice is not the correction of an excess, but the\nwhole pattern of the domination of one opposite followed by that of\nthe other. \n\nThere is, however, a guiding force in the world:\n\nThunderbolt steers all things. (B64)\n\n\nThe fiery shaft of lightning is a symbol of the direction of the\nworld. Anaximander may have already used the image of the shipmaster\nof the universe (Kahn 1960: 238). Heraclitus identifies it with the\nthunderbolt, itself an attribute of Zeus the storm god. The changes\nwrought by and symbolized by fire govern the world. The ruling power\nof the universe can be identified with Zeus, but not in a\nstraightforward way: \u201cOne being, the only wise one, would and\nwould not be called by the name of Zeus\u201d (B32). And here the\nword used for \u2018Zeus\u2019 can be rendered \u201cLife.\u201d\nLike the Milesians, Heraclitus identifies the ruling power of the\nworld with deity, but (like them also) his conception is not a\nconventional one. \n\nHeraclitus provided some sort of discussion of meteorological and\nastronomical phenomena. He studied the disappearance and reappearance\nof the moon at the end and beginning of a month (Oxyrhynchus Papyri\nLIII 3710 ii. 43\u201347 and iii. 7\u201311\u2013the clearest\nevidence that Heraclitus had a scientific interest in astronomy). He\nexplained the sun and moon as bowls full of fire. As the moon\u2019s\nbowl rotated it caused the phases. Eclipses were the result of a\nrotation of the convex side of the bowls to face the earth. We have no\nreports about the earth itself, but we may suppose that, like his\npredecessors, Heraclitus viewed it as flat. Evaporations from the\nearth and sea apparently provided fuel for the heavenly bodies, which\nburned like oil lamps. \n\nDivine power is manifest in all phenomena: \u201cGod is day night,\nwinter summer, war peace, satiety hunger, and he alters just as\n<fire> when it is mixed with spices is named according to the\naroma of each of them\u201d (B67). Again Heraclitus seems to stress\nthe unity of divine power, even if humans assign different names and\nattributes to it. All things that happen are good, but humans do not\nperceive them to be so: \u201cTo God all things are fair, good and\njust, but men suppose some things are unjust, some just\u201d (B102).\nHeraclitus does not attempt to provide a detailed theodicy, but seeks\nto view all things sub specie aeternitatis, in which conflict\n(including presumably human conflict) keeps the world going (B80,\ncited above). \n",
