Historical Antecedents\n\nExternalism\u2014whether of content or vehicle\u2014is often viewed\nas a peculiar eruption of late twentieth-century analytic philosophy.\nThis, however, is historically myopic. Cognate views with fairly clear\nexternalist credentials have been advanced and defended much earlier\nthan this, and in some of the defining works of twentieth-century\nphilosophy (see Rowlands 2003: Chapters 3&4). Wittgenstein (1953)\nargued that meaning something by a sign does not consist in an inner\nstate or process. Rather, the possibility of such meaning depends\nessentially on the existence of a custom or practice\nof using a sign in given way, and the mastery of a\ntechnique\u2014i.e., the ability to adjust one\u2019s use of\nthe sign to bring in into accordance with this custom. According to\nthe dominant\u2014community\u2014interpretation of the\nnotion of a custom, this entails that the possibility of meaning\nsomething by a sign is dependent on the existence of a practice\nexternal to the individual meaner, and that what this individual means\nby a sign on any given occasion depends, at least in part, on this\nexternal practice. As we shall see, this social version of content\nexternalism was later developed, powerfully, by Burge (1979,\n1986).\n\nThere are earlier views that are, at least, closely aligned with\nexternalism. Sartre (1943 [1957]) argued that consciousness\u2014his\nterm for intentional mental acts in general\u2014is nothing\nin the sense that it exists only as a pure directedness towards the\nworld, and is essentially dependent for its existence on the objects\nto which it is directed. As a consequence, Sartre claimed,\nconsciousness has \u201cno content\u201d. What he meant by this that\nwhat we, today, would call the contents of intentional acts are\nalways, necessarily, outside those acts\u2014transcendent items in\nthe world rather than immanent things inside consciousness. Content\nexternalism seems to be a trivial implication of this. If it were\npossible to transplant a consciousness from one world to\nanother\u2014a staple, as we shall see, of later externalist\nliterature, but which may or may not make sense on Sartre\u2019s\nview\u2014the contents of this consciousness would necessarily\nchange. The reason this may not qualify as externalism in the standard\nsense, however, is that Sartre also defended a revisionist conception\nof the body. The body-as-lived, Sartre argued, is not\nidentical with the body-as-object\u2014the way the body is\nconceived of in the formulation of externalism. Rather, the\nbody-as-lived is revealing activity whose boundaries in no way\ncoincide with those of the body-as-object. Thus, rather than being a\nstraightforward form of externalism, Sartre\u2019s view may better be\nregarded as an abandoning the categories in terms of which the ideas\nof externalism\u2014and its oppositional counterpart,\ninternalism\u2014are formulated. The same is true of Heidegger (1927\n[1962]), to whom Sartre\u2019s discussion of the body was heavily\nindebted. Heidegger urges us to think of human\nreality\u2014dasein, the characteristic type of being\npossessed by humans\u2014not as a biological organism but, rather, as\na network of natural and social practices. Humans minds, to the extent\nthey have any place in this scheme, would certainly not reside in\nhuman bodies. However\u2014and this is why it does not qualify as\nexternalism in the usual sense\u2014neither do bodies. (But see\nWheeler 2005, for a defense of extended mind grounded in\nHeidegger\u2019s work.)\n\nWhether or not they can ultimately be characterized as externalist,\nthe views of Wittgenstein, Sartre and Heidegger play an important role\nin contextualizing the later development of externalism. Like\nexternalism, they all occupy a position that can be labeled\nanti-Cartesian. They are all opposed to the idea that the\nmental processes had by an individual are always, and completely,\ndetermined by what is going on inside that individual\u2019s body (or\nthey expand the idea of the body in non-Cartesian ways, as in the case\nof Sartre and Heidegger). This type of view is not peculiar to\nphilosophy. In psychology, expressions of the idea can be found in the\nwork of the Soviet psychologists, most notably Vygotsky (1934 [1962]), and Luria and Vygotsky (1930 [1992]) and later in James Gibson\u2019s (1966, 1979) development of an ecological psychology (see also Donald 1991 for a more recent development in this tradition). The roots of this anti-Cartesianism are not only\nbroad but deep, predating Heidegger, and indeed the twentieth century.\nGallagher (2018) argues that versions of this can be found in American\npragmatism. It may be that the ultimate roots of this sort of anti-Cartesianism lie in Hegel (Crisafi & Gallagher 2010; Boldyrev\n& Herrmann-Pillath 2013). Whether or not this is correct,\nexternalism\u2014in either form\u2014is best regarded as less an unprecedented eruption, and more as a recent expression of this\nhistorical tradition of anti-Cartesian thought.\n",
