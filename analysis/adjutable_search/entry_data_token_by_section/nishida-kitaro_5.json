    "main_text": "Theory of Universals and the Logic of Place || Analogies to the Logic of Place\n3.2 Analogies to the Logic of Place\n\n\nNishida intended his theory of place or topos to provide a logical\nfoundation for his previous philosophy of experience and\nself-awareness. Several overlapping models help make sense of this\nlogic. Nishida drew upon some models explicitly, for example, Plato\u2019s\nnotion of the receptacle (chora) of ideas in the\nTimeus and Aristotle\u2019s adaptation in his notion of\ntopos in On the Soul.  Another model Nishida used\nearly on was the notion of fields in modern physics and relativity\ntheory, in which space-time is a field inseparable from the physical\nobjects within it and determining how (when and where) they exist.\nAnalogously, for Nishida, all perceived and conceptualized objects are\n\u201cin\u201d the \u201cfield of consciousness\u201d (Nishida\nborrowed the term from William James). Another early model was the\nlogic of universals that serve as predicates. Particulars or\nindividuals are placed within universals to specify their difference\nfrom other particulars or individuals, and less extensive universals\nare placed within more extensive ones, until one reaches the ultimate,\nboundless universal called nothingness. This \u201ctranscendental\npredicate\u201d cannot become the subject matter of any description\nor proposition in positive terms, but it is ultimately entailed by\nevery specification. \n\n\nOther analogies, although not explicitly mentioned by Nishida,\nnevertheless serve to clarify his logic at least in part.  A model of\ninterpretation is relevant: every text has its context, which in turn\nmay be made a text or thematized by appealing to a further context. \nThere is no final context that can be specified without referring to\nyet another context. For Nishida this relation would not be settled by invoking the notion of an infinite regress; rather it indicates the necessity of an ultimate context of a different order, one that allows the distinction between a specific text and its context. This ultimately unspecifiable context in\nNishida\u2019s terms is called absolute nothingness.  The analysis of\nsuccessful physical theories provides yet another model. Each of\nNishida\u2019s successive topoi serves as a level of analysis that resolves\ncontradictions on less comprehensive levels, as Einstein\u2019s relativity\ntheory encompasses Newtonian theory and resolves contradictions in\nit. But for Nishida the final level that holds differences or\ncontradictions together is ultimately unanalyzable absolute\nnothingness. Despite Nishida\u2019s relative ignorance of modern logic and\nhis identification of predicates with universals, we may also find\nparallels to his logic of place in mathematical logic: an axiomatic\nsystem is a topos that, according to G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem, is not\nself-explanatory or self-generating since it contains undecidable\npropositions, and there is no final system with a self-explanatory\nfoundation. Nishida\u2019s absolute nothingness is the place beyond\ndiscursive determination. Discourse analysis also suggests parallels:\nit analyzes how a discourse is framed or directed to an audience with\ncertain interests, but the analysis too has its own frame that does\nnot terminate in any definitive or final frame.  Foundationalist\ntheories of knowledge and reality might seem to provide a model of\nNishida\u2019s logic of place, but in Nishida the metaphor of grounding\ngives way to that of placing, locating, or encompassing, and in any case the ultimate\nplace is more an Abgrund or void than a positive ground.\n",
