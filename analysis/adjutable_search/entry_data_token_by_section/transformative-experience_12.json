    "main_text": "Decision Theory: Is It Rational to Choose Transformative Experiences? || Future Preference Uncertainty\n4.2 Future Preference Uncertainty\n\nSuppose that the approximate values of associated with outcomes can be\nknown. The second challenge for standard decision theory procedures\narises from the fact that transformative experiences have the\npotential to be personally transformative. Since personal\ntransformation can involve extreme preference changes, the way\noutcomes are valued might not remain stable from before and after the\ntransformation. For instance, a prospective parent might not value\nsleep, but once they become a parent confronted with a screaming\ninfant that needs to be fed every few hours throughout the night, the\nway they value sleep may drastically shift. The values of outcomes\nused as inputs typically correspond to the preferences of the\npre-transformed agent making the decision. If those preferences will\nshift unpredictably post-transformation, then knowing the values\nassociated with the outcomes still may not be enough to allow an agent\nto make a rational decision.\n\nIn some sense, the challenge of changing preferences blends two\nfamiliar problems. First, preferences change over time. For instance,\npeople with the means to save for retirement must balance their\ncurrent preferences with what they believe will be their future ones.\nAn extreme saver\u2019s later self may look back and wish their\nearlier self had spent more on vacations. Transformative experiences\nadd a further wrinkle by making the future preferences unknown.\nSecond, changing preferences present a diachronic problem in which\npast, present, and future preferences must be balanced against each\nother. Presumably, this balancing involves aggregating all of these\npreferences, as well as deciding how to weigh them. For instance, many\npeople are near-biased, and tend to weigh the preferences of their\ncurrent and near-future selves far heavier than the preferences of\ntheir distant-future selves. The preferences of past selves rarely\nreceive any attention at all. (Parfit [1984] has a series of thought\nexperiments generating the intuition that it\u2019s better for pain\nto be in the past, even if past pain is more severe than future pain.\nSullivan [2018] and Boonin [2019] offer uncommonly held dissenting\nviews: the former argues for temporal neutrality, or not engaging in\nany temporal discounting of the past or distant future, while the\nlatter argues that the past preferences\u2014even those belonging to\npeople who are no longer alive\u2014matter.)\n\nPettigrew (2019) offers a sophisticated account that has two\ncomponents aimed at tackling both of these problems. The first, aimed\nat the uncertainty surrounding what the future preferences\nwill be, bears similarity to responses to the challenge of assigning\nvalues given the \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d uncertainty.\nBasically, just as we can gather information about how people value\ntransformative experiences, we can gather information about how\npeople\u2019s preferences change after undergoing transformative\nexperiences. In an oversimplified example, if it turned out that 95%\nof new parents would prefer to be childless again, then given that one\nchooses to have a child, there would be a 95% chance that their future\nself would have the childless preference while there\u2019d be a 5%\nchance that their future self would have a child-full preference.\nThen, just as decision procedures weigh the values of potential\noutcomes by their likelihood when we make decisions, they could\ninclude weighted preferences.\n\nThe second component, aimed at tackling the diachronic aspect of\nchanging preferences, introduces a weighted general value function\nthat aggregates the \u201clocal\u201d value functions that\ncorrespond to the past, present, and future selves that make up the\nentire life of the agent. Further, the way in which the local value\nfunctions are aggregated can incorporate differences in the ways in\nwhich local selves handle probability assignments, decision\nprocedures, and the weighing of, e.g., past versus future preferences.\nAggregating the local value functions thus begins to resemble a social\nchoice problem. Agents faced with choosing for changing selves ought\nto maximize the general value function, which aggregates the local\nvalue functions accounting for each temporally located local self.\n\nPaul (2022) points out that Pettigrew\u2019s account is vulnerable in\ntwo ways. First, the type of solution proposed by Pettigrew likens\nfuture selves to third parties. As noted, the weighted general value\nfunction closely resembles functions that aggregate individual\npreferences to group ones in social contexts. But it seems\ninappropriate to treat our future selves as third persons instead of\nfully integrated selves\u2014and this is precisely the thrust of the\nproblem that transformative experience presents! Second, it assumes\nthat meaningful intrapersonal comparisons can be made. There\u2019s\nsome empirical work, especially regarding how people with disabilities\njudge their own welfare, that suggests these comparisons are difficult\nto make. Pettigrew (2019, \u00a7 8.6) attempts to address this issue with his\n\u201cmatching intervals solution\u201d, which attempts to scale\nthe different utility functions to each other. Briggs (2015) offers a\nprudence-inspired alternative that rests on privileging a\nperson\u2019s actual preferences (as opposed to their counterfactual\npreferences) without privileging their present preferences (as opposed\nto privileging present over future ones). Though success of any of\nthese intrapersonal comparisons is an open question, there is\nwidespread agreement that they are necessary to explain how future\npreferences can matter.\n",
