    "main_text": "The Uncomputable\n4. The Uncomputable\n\n\nTuring turned to the exploration of the uncomputable for his\nPrinceton Ph.D. thesis (1938), which then appeared as Systems of\nLogic based on Ordinals (Turing 1939). \n\n\nIt is generally the view, as expressed by Feferman (1988), that this\nwork was a diversion from the main thrust of his work. But from another\nangle, as expressed in (Hodges 1997), one can see Turing's development\nas turning naturally from considering the mind when following a rule,\nto the action of the mind when not following a rule. In\nparticular this 1938 work considered the mind when seeing the truth of\none of G\u00f6del's true but formally unprovable propositions, and\nhence going beyond rules based on the axioms of the system. As Turing\nexpressed it (Turing 1939, p. 198), there are \u2018formulae, seen\nintuitively to be correct, but which the G\u00f6del theorem shows are\nunprovable in the original system.\u2019 Turing's theory of\n\u2018ordinal logics\u2019 was an attempt to \u2018avoid as far as\npossible the effects of G\u00f6del's theorem\u2019 by studying the\neffect of adding G\u00f6del sentences as new axioms to create stronger\nand stronger logics. It did not reach a definitive conclusion.\n\n\nIn his investigation, Turing introduced the idea of an\n\u2018oracle\u2019 capable of performing, as if by magic, an\nuncomputable operation. Turing's oracle cannot be considered as some\n\u2018black box\u2019 component of a new class of machines, to be put\non a par with the primitive operations of reading single symbols, as\nhas been suggested by (Copeland 1998). An oracle is infinitely more\npowerful than anything a modern computer can do, and nothing like\nan elementary component of a computer. Turing defined\n\u2018oracle-machines\u2019 as Turing machines with an additional\nconfiguration in which they \u2018call the oracle\u2019 so as to take\nan uncomputable step. But these oracle-machines are not purely\nmechanical. They are only partially mechanical, like Turing's\nchoice-machines. Indeed the whole point of the oracle-machine\nis to explore the realm of what cannot be done by purely\nmechanical processes. Turing emphasised (Turing 1939, p. 173):\nWe shall not go any further into the nature of this oracle\napart from saying that it cannot be a machine.\n\n\nTuring's oracle can be seen simply as a mathematical tool, useful\nfor exploring the mathematics of the uncomputable. The idea of an\noracle allows the formulation of questions of relative rather\nthan absolute computability. Thus Turing opened new fields of\ninvestigation in mathematical logic. However, there is also a possible\ninterpretation in terms of human cognitive capacity. On this\ninterpretation, the oracle is related to the \u2018intuition\u2019\ninvolved in seeing the truth of a G\u00f6del statement. M. H. A.\nNewman, who introduced Turing to mathematical logic and continued to\ncollaborate with him, wrote in (Newman 1955) that the oracle resembles\na mathematician \u2018having an idea\u2019, as opposed to using a\nmechanical method. However, Turing's oracle cannot actually be\nidentified with a human mental faculty. It is too powerful: it\nimmediately supplies the answer as to whether any given Turing machine\nis \u2018satisfactory,\u2019 something no human being could do. On\nthe other hand, anyone hoping to see mental \u2018intuition\u2019\ncaptured completely by an oracle, must face the difficulty that Turing\nshowed how his argument for the incompleteness of Turing machines could\nbe applied with equal force to oracle-machines (Turing 1939, p. 173).\nThis point has been emphasised by Penrose (1994, p. 380). Newman's\ncomment might better be taken to refer to the different oracle\nsuggested later on (Turing 1939, p. 200), which has the property of\nrecognising \u2018ordinal formulae.\u2019 One can only safely say\nthat Turing's interest at this time in uncomputable operations appears\nin the general setting of studying the mental\n\u2018intuition\u2019 of truths which are not established by\nfollowing mechanical processes (Turing 1939, p. 214ff.).\n\n\nIn Turing's presentation, intuition is in practice present in every\npart of a mathematician's thought, but when mathematical proof is\nformalised, intuition has an explicit manifestation in those steps\nwhere the mathematician sees the truth of a formally unprovable\nstatement. Turing did not offer any suggestion as to what he considered\nthe brain was physically doing in a moment of such\n\u2018intuition\u2019; indeed the word \u2018brain\u2019 did not\nappear in his writing in this era. This question is of interest because\nof the views of Penrose (1989, 1990, 1994, 1996) on just this issue:\nPenrose holds that the ability of the mind to see formally unprovable\ntruths shows that there must be uncomputable physical operations in the\nbrain. It should be noted that there is widespread disagreement about\nwhether the human mind is really seeing the truth of a G\u00f6del\nsentence; see for instance the discussion in (Penrose 1990) and the\nreviews following it. However Turing's writing at this period accepted\nwithout criticism the concept of intuitive recognition of the\ntruth.\n\n\nIt was also at this period that Turing met Wittgenstein, and there\nis a full record of their 1939 discussions on the foundations of\nmathematics in (Diamond 1976). To the disappointment of many, there is\nno record of any discussions between them, verbal or written, on the\nproblem of Mind.\n\n\nIn 1939 Turing's various energetic investigations were broken off\nfor war work. This did, however, have the positive feature of leading\nTuring to turn his universal machine into the practical form of the\nmodern digital computer.\n",
