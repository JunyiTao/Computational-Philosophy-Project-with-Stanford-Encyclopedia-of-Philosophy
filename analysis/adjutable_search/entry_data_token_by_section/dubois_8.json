    "main_text": "Political Philosophy\n4. Political Philosophy\n\nDu Bois\u2019s political philosophy belongs to the Afro-modern\ntradition of political thought, an impressively rich body of non-ideal\npolitical theory that is bound together by certain thematic\npreoccupations\u2014e.g., the political and social organization of\nwhite supremacy, the nature and effects of racial ideology, and the\npossibilities of black emancipation\u2014 and that includes the\nwritings of Ottabah Cugoano, David Walker, Edward Blyden, Martin\nDelany, Frederick Douglass, and Alexander Crummell (Gooding-Williams,\n2009). Du Bois\u2019s most famous book, The Souls of Black\nFolk (1903a), is his earliest contribution to that tradition. Du\nBois\u2019s subsequent contributions to political philosophy and\npolitical theory appear in several different places and have been\nvariously taken up by contemporary\n scholars.[35]\n",
