    "main_text": "History of Derivations of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n3. History of Derivations of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n\nEinstein first derived mass-energy equivalence from the principles of\nspecial relativity in a small article titled \u201cDoes the Inertia\nof a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?\u201d (1905b). This\nderivation, along with others that followed soon after (e.g., Planck\n(1906), Von Laue (1911)), uses Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism. (See\n Section 3.1.)\n However, as Einstein later observed (1935), mass-energy equivalence\nis a result that should be independent of any theory that describes a\nspecific physical interaction. This is the main reason that led\nphysicists to search for \u201cpurely dynamical\u201d derivations,\ni.e., derivations that invoke only mechanical concepts such as energy\nand momentum, and the conservation principles that govern them. (See\n Section 3.2)\n",
