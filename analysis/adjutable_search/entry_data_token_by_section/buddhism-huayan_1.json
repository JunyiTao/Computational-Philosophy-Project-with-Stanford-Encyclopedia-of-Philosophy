    "main_text": "Basic Concepts || Chinese Developments\n1.2 Chinese Developments\n\nBuddhism was brought to China by missionaries some time during the\nfirst century CE. Indian scriptures and expositions arrived in China\npiecemeal, with the result that early Chinese adherents to Buddhism\ndid not perceive contributions from different Indian traditions as\nfundamentally inconsistent. Chinese Buddhism is thus eclectic in its\nuse of concepts from what were originally distinct Indian Buddhist\nschools. This, in turn, led to the practice of (Ch.) panjiao\n(doctrinal classification), according to which different philosophical\nsystems are treated not as exclusive, but as partial conceptions of\nthe truth, which can be arranged hierarchically in terms of how\ncomplete (literally, \u201crounded,\u201d Ch. yuan) their\ngrasp of the truth is. To use Western terminology, one might say that\npanjiao is a form of inference to the best explanation, since\nthe more comprehensive teachings are shown to offer a more plausible\nand comprehensive interpretation of the relevant ethical,\nmetaphysical, and empirical assumptions. \n\nUpon gradually growing in influence, Buddhism became one of the\n\u201cThree Teachings\u201d (Ch. San jiao) of the Chinese\ntradition, along with Confucianism and Daoism. In fact, at times\nBuddhism has been the dominant religious and philosophical movement in\nChina (among both intellectuals and commoners). However, there have\nbeen several periods of Buddhist persecution in Chinese history. In\n567 CE, Wei Yuansong (n.d.), having left the Buddhist order, argued to\nEmperor Wu of the Northern Zhou (543\u2013578, ruled 561\u2013578) that Buddhism\nshould be de-institutionalized. He argued that Buddhism is responsible\nfor social instability because its various institutions\u2014monastic\nliving, internal hierarchies, and freedom from political\ncontrol\u2014undermine harmony-facilitating Chinese culture and\ntradition by virtue of facilitating corruption among monks and by\nisolating Buddhism from practical affairs (Ch. shi). \n\nEmperor Wu\u2019s subsequent persecutions of Buddhism, in 574 and\n577, disrupted Buddhist institutions. Many monks fled to rural areas,\nseeking forms of Buddhism better suited to a Chinese context.\nSearching for ways to make Buddhism more accessible to laity, for more\namenable practices and more achievable ideals, they also began\nexploring in earnest scriptures that receive little if any attention\nin the well-established schools of Indian Buddhism. The lack of\ndefinitive commentaries on these scriptures from established Indian\ntraditions, together with political disruptions to the inertia of\nextant scholarly traditions of Buddhism, permitted a freedom of\ncreative appropriation and innovation that resulted in traditions of\nBuddhism unique to the Chinese context. \n\nHuayan is one of these traditions. Chief among the scriptures\nresponsible for its distinctive teachings are the Avatamsaka\n(Flower Garland) Sutra and Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana. Huayan takes its name from the Avatamsaka\nSutra (Ch. Huayan jing), which presents a dizzyingly\ncomplex and intricate vision of reality as thoroughly\n\u201cinterpenetrating,\u201d of Buddhahood as coextensive with all\nthere is, and of the features of reality as completely dependent upon\nthe mind and deeds of sentient beings. Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana develops the theory of the tathagatagarbha,\n(Skt. for \u201cBuddha-embryo\u201d or \u201cBuddha-womb\u201d),\nthe potentiality of Buddhahood. It posits One Mind as the foundation\nof reality. It also ascribes to One Mind two aspects, tathata\n(Skt. for \u201csuchness\u201d or \u201cthusness\u201d) and\nsamsara. Tathata refers to reality as experienced\nwithout dukkha; it is generally taken to be non-conceptual\nand hence incapable of being expressed in words. Samsara is\nreality as experienced with dukkha. Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana presents these aspects as mutually inclusive and\ninseparable. \n",
