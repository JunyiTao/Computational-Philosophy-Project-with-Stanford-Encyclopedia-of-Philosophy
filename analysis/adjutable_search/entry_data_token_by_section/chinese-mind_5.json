    "main_text": "Normative conceptions of the person || The Mohists\n2.2 The Mohists\n\nThe Mozi (\u58a8\u5b50) is named after its founder Mo\nDi (\u58a8\u7fdf, 470\u2013391 BCE). The school of Mohism is\nrightly credited for bringing argumentation into Chinese philosophy\n(Hansen 1992). It is revealing that Mengzi says in 3B9 that while he\nis not fond of arguments, he is compelled to argue with the Yangists\nand the Mohists because \u201ctheir language (yan) fills the\nworld beneath the sky\u201d. The Mohists contrast utilitarian\nconsequentialism with reliance on tradition. Tian\n(sky-nature) desires human well-being. Traditional rituals guiding\nconduct or social and political policies should be reformed to improve\npeople\u2019s livelihood. The argument is a strong one against total\nreliance on tradition, but Mozi seems to compromise when he reflects\non the standards of correct yan (language use\u2014see\nbelow). He shares Confucius\u2019 insight about the role of learning\nto the heart-mind\u2019s guidance of behavior. He also shares\nConfucius\u2019 view of the role of political leader as\neducator-in-chief. If the ruler\u2019s speech and behavior promote\nuniversal human well-being, the people\u2019s behavior will change\n\u201cin a single generation\u201d.\n\nMozi\u2019s focus on developing a social and political dao\nthat creates and sustains general well-being starts from assumptions\nabout the heart-mind different from the Confucians. He envisions a\ncounterpart of Hobbes \u201cstate of nature\u201d with the important\ndifference that the disorder is not a produce of universal\nself-interest but of moral disagreement. Everyone is assumed to be\nmotivated morally, but to have different \u7fa9 yi\n(moralities). The social project he imagines is one of unifying the\nvarying conceptions of morality.\n\nThat social project, however, presupposed another fundamental\npsychological assumption\u2014that the social world could identify\nand agree on who was \u201cwisest and best\u201d to lead the social\nconstruction project. And the project itself hints at some assumptions\nabout human psychology. The leader, apparently selected by\nacclimation, admits he\u2019s unable to unify all the world\u2019s\nmoralities. He appoints a Confucian-style hierarchical bureaucracy to\nassist him. Each level of the hierarchy reports to those in the next\nhigher level. Still, even those at the bottom of the hierarchy (e.g.,\nthe village) admit their inability to say what is moral, so they\nconsult with ordinary people, who are to report what they find moral\nand immoral. This stage is where Mozi speaks of punishing whoever will\nnot cooperate in this project of social morality construction by\nwithholding judgment.\n\nEach level of the construction bureaucracy reports up the hierarchy.\nHowever, the original assumption of moral disagreement is seemingly\nignored. Either at each level, there is no disagreement or the officer\ntaking the reports resolves disagreements somehow. The\n\u201cwisest and best\u201d makes the final decision. Hints of how\nthat decision is made come from the contributions Mohists make to\ndeveloping a Chinese practical conception of knowing (zhi\n\u77e5). Practical knowing, knowing-how, can underlie how we use\nwords and how we adapt modeled behavior in our own practice. The skill\nwe learn in learning \u540dm\u00edng (names or terms) is learning\nto \u8faf bian (divide) into \u662f shi this and\n\u975efei not-that. When paired, the translators routinely\nuse \u201cright-wrong\u201d as in right-from-wrong, right and wrong,\nright or wrong. The demonstrative form reminds us that such choices\nare made in real-time contexts.\n\nMozi suggests three standards for right and wrong use of terms:\n\nLooking to the roots and original baptism with terms by the Sage\nKings and in accordance with the historical record of their ritual\nbehaviors. This is Mozi\u2019s compromise with Confucianism.\nContinuity in language is important if know-how from the past is to be\nsuccessfully stored and transmitted to later generations.\nAccording with the eyes and ears of the people, a kind of\nintersubjective consensus of observation. This \u201cempirical\u201d\nstandard informs Mohist emphasis on measurement operations.\n\n\n\nThe hundred artisans make squares with the set square, circles with\nthe compass, straight lines with the string, vertical lines with the\nplumb line, and flat surfaces with the level. Whether skilled artisans\nor unskilled artisans, all take these five as models. The skilled are\nable to conform to them exactly. The unskilled, though unable to\nconform to them exactly, by following them in undertaking their work\nstill do better than they do on their own. (Mozi CTP: Book\n1.4 [trans. 2020: book 4.1])\n \nTheir practical use leads to general benefit. (Mozi CTP:\nBook 9.1\u20132 [trans. 2020: book 35])\n\n\nThese standards seem potentially incoherent in that there seems no\nguarantee that the results of applying one will be the same as the\nresults of applying the others. One way to help is make utility the\nprimary standard which justifies and guides application of the other\ntwo standards: past usage is to be maintained to preserve social\nknow-how and coordination practices which benefit the people. Making\nusage reflect ordinary empirical judgments makes learning easier and\napplication more reliable. Mozi\u2019s conception of usefulness is\nrobustly natural-bodily goods: food, clothing, housing, time with and\ncare for parents etc. He not only does not focus on pleasure, he\ndisapproves of it. \u6a02 (le pleasure or yue\nmusic\u2014especially royal concerts and funerals) wasted material\ngoods and labor. Stable families and social order included filiality.\nThe early Mohist conception of benefit, therefore, seems to have been\nconstituted by a plurality of basic social goods, which indicates\ntheir social and political orientation towards identifying a\ndao or guiding path for society.\n\nThis solution has the advantage of explaining curious aspects of\nMozi\u2019s defense of \u201cthere are ghosts\u201d and opposition\nto \u201cthere is fate\u201d. He explains the first by testimony as\nto the appearance and actions of ghosts who punish wrongdoers and\nreward those who do what is right. However, chapter 31 of the Mozi\nsimply justifies sacrifices on the grounds that the sage-kings\npracticed them, and the doctrine promotes good effects among the\nliving (i.e., sacrificial ceremonies to spirits build kinship among\nthe living and provide them with the food and wine). It suggests\nghosts do not exist but teaching and acting on their existence is\nbeneficial. It is probably a mistake to infer from this one passage\nthat the early Mohists theorized about truth vs. pragmatic benefits of\nbelief, though later Mohists may be interpreted as noticing such a\ndistinction.\n\nThe early Mohist primacy of the benefit standard makes its ethics the\nfirst consequentialist ethic in history. Destructive conflict among\npeople, families, and states is diagnosed in the Mozi as due\nto conflicting social mores and relative bias toward our own family,\nvillage, state and culture. Utilitarian reasoning yields a normative\npsychological solution: adopt jian ai (\u517c\u611b)\n(Mozi, CTP: book 4, chapters 14\u201316 [trans. 2020: books\n14\u201316]). Sometimes translated as \u201cuniversal love\u201d\nbut now more often as \u201cinclusive\u201d or \u201cimpartial\ncaring\u201d, it is best understood as opposed to an exclusive focus\non the well-being of oneself and one\u2019s relatives as the source\nof destructive behavior (for discussion of these controversies, see\nentries on\n Mohism\n and\n Chinese ethics).\n Jian ai is a moral attitude of care towards everyone and\nsupports governance that distributes benefits to all, taking special\ncare of those in need and less able to provide for themselves. The\nMohists assume (arguably with Confucians) that our heart-minds are\nshaped by the teachings promoted by social leaders\u2014starting with\nthe ruler.\n\nJian ai is a moral attitude of care towards everyone and\nsupports governance that distributes benefits to all, taking special\ncare of those in need and less able to provide for themselves. The\nMohists assume (arguably with Confucians) that our heart-minds are\nshaped by the teachings promoted by social leaders\u2014starting with\nthe ruler.\n\nThe later Mohists shifted most weight to an empirical standard and\ntaught that the language to be used should emphasize something more\nlike \u201ccarving nature at the joints\u201d. The main object of\nall learning was skills in sorting things reliably into their correct\ncategories according to the patterns of their similarities and\ndifferences (Mozi, CTP: Book 12.8 [trans. 2020: Book 47.9]).\nInterest in human well-being expressed itself in widening interest in\nknowing the natural world. The utilitarian core was\nren\uff08\u4ec1\uff09the virtue of impartial or\ninclusive care and the behavior was yi (\u7fa9) morally\nright. The Mohist concept of measurement standards (fa\n\u6cd5) remain central in this realist later Mohist phase. The\nzhi \u5fd7will of Tian (Sky or Nature),\nMozi\u2019s original source of normative guidance, was\nmeasurement-like utility. We naturally choose the lesser of two harms\nand greater of two benefits.\n\nThe role of Tian in Mohism suggests a kind of naturalism in\ntheir conception of psychology and the capacity to adopt an attitude\nof jian ai. In chapter 28 on Tian\u2019s intent,\nMozi says that he measures Tian nature\u2019s intent as a\nwheelwright measures with a compass and a carpenter the square.\nTian\u2019s intent is a command, but a pattern in\nthings\u2014flipping the Western argument from design. The world is\nhere for human benefit. It benefits and nourishes everyone; it rewards\nsocieties who act together and share and harm those that do not. It\nmakes no distinction among humans and provides life and sustenance to\nrich and poor, noble and low, kin and non kin; it created the regular\nand constant pattern of the seasons and weather that makes all these\nbroadly distributed benefits possible.\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 theories revolve around the concept of\n\u8fafbian distinctions in language. The role of\nTian is tied to nature\u2019s joints, natural points of\ndistinction. The natural normative distinction is between benefit and\nharm. Appealing to that distinction as a measure of \u201cthis\u201d\nand \u201cnot-that\u201d yields a naturalistic argument for\nuniversal concern in government. Bian comes to be used of any\ntheorist\u2019s justifying of a guiding distinction. This makes the\nMohist use of the concept unlike \u201cargument\u201d in Western\nphilosophy. The conventional translation is misleading. The Mohists\ndid not conceive of arguments as consisting of premises and a\nconclusion and a form that guaranteed truth was preserved. It is\nrather that some distinctions are assumed in arguing for other\ndistinctions. The Mohists appeal to distinctions where nature takes a\nstand as in operational use of a measurement tool. Compasses,\ncarpenter\u2019s squares, and plumb lines, give reliable and precise\ndistinctions for sorting and choosing. This guides effective and\nbeneficial action and policy in government both because nature is\ninvolved and ordinary people, using their eyes and ears, can recognize\nand acknowledge the result. This makes the operational measurement\nuseful as well as reliable and accurate (true).\n\nThe Mohist conception of bian is deeply pragmatic. The ways\nof teaching language and behavior is ultimately guided by the natural\nbian of benefit-harm\u2014arguably a distinction deeply\nembedded in our heart-minds. This pragmatism is also illustrated by\nthe different kinds of appeal they make in their arguments for\njian ai. Given their view that chaotic conflict results from\neveryone acting on their own view of what is right, one might infer\nthat they believe people to be typically motivated to do what they\nthink is right. However, they argue for jian ai on other\nnormative grounds besides its naturalness. It seems to require both\nmodeling from the leader and a punishment and reward structure. There\nis not much worry over the tensions between saying that Tian\nand other supernatural agents reward and punish to enforce the moral\norder and also asserting the need for a strict and rigid hierarchical\ngovernment structure that incentivizes conformity to that moral order.\nPerkins (2014) puts the problem of evil in its most general form: bad\nthings happen to good people, and this regular occurrence troubles\naccepting that Tian or nature is equally benevolent to all\nhuman beings. In a philosophical tradition that is developing\nvigorous, argumentative debate, that belief will become increasingly\ntroubled. This may be a reason why Tian drops out of the\ndiscourse of the later Mohists, who contributed to increasing\nconceptual resources for debate.\n\nThe later Mohists kept the basic outlines of the consequentialist\nethic that Mozi and the early followers developed, but further\ndeveloped and revised that ethic along with their methodology of\nargument, philosophy of language and epistemology. In addition, they\nwrote on metaphysical topics such as causality and space and time, and\nin a number of the sciences such as geometry and mechanics. Their\nwritings comprise six chapters of the Mozi (see CTP: chapters\n40\u201345 [trans. 2020: part IV]). The later Mohists are true to\ntheir forebearers in conceiving the cognitive capabilities of human\nbeings as functioning to bian discern different kinds and\nidentifying which things belonged or did not belong to these kinds.\nThough these capabilities involve empirical contact with the world,\nthe later Mohists didn\u2019t invoke mental representations of\npropositions. The contact makes the heart-mind aware of distinctions,\nboundaries of things. And this information guides the practical\nability to sort things appropriately for behavior. Assigning a name to\na thing or thing to a name is sorting into shi, right or\nthis, and fei, wrong or not-that. The translation of\nbian as argument leads some to attribute the Mohists with\ndeveloping syllogistic reasoning. They rather cultivate skill or\nknow-how in carving the world with linguistic distinctions. They\nreflect no conception of reasoning with ideas, mentalistic\nitems in container-like heart-mind. The primary term of epistemology\nis \u201cknowing\u201d zhi \uff08\u77e5), which is a\ncapacity like eyesight (Mozi, CTP: Book 10 Canon I.3 [trans.\n2020: books 40\u20133, A3]. They are focused on the capabilities or\nskills to reliably sort out the relations between various kinds, e.g.,\nthat the category of oxen belongs to the larger category of\nanimals.\n\nAs to the question of whether the later Mohists made more fundamental\nchanges to their tradition, scholars diverge in their interpretations.\nA.C. Graham, in his influential Disputers of the Tao, saw the\nlater Mohists as engaging in a kind of a priori\nsystematization of the earlier ethic through a series of interlocking\ndefinitions of crucial terms such as ren and yi\n(Graham 1989: 146). Such a reading may be too much in tension with the\npragmatic reliabilism exhibited by their concern to sort things out\ninto the right kinds. Stephens (2021; see him also for a detailed\ncritique of Graham\u2019s interpretation) provides another\ninterpretation that has the later Mohists broadening their conception\nof benefit and harm on the basis of a preference satisfaction\ncriterion using pleasure and displeasure as indicators (Mozi,\nCTP: Book 10 Canon I and Expositions 26\u201327 [trans. 2020: Books\n40\u20133 A 26\u201327]). This addresses criticisms they might have\nreceived about the narrowness of the earlier list of benefits, as well\nas the Zhuangzi\u2019s point about the diversity of things\nthat people value (see\n \u00a72.5\n below). The later Mohists also introduced the conception of weighing\nbenefits and harms, which makes possible an all-things-considered\njudgment as to what actions or policies most benefit or least harm a\nsociety (Mozi, CTP: Book 11.3, 11.5 [trans. 2020: Books\n44.3a\u2013c, 44.5 ]). They recognized the permissibility of\nbenefiting one\u2019s parents and the elderly more than others\n(Mozi, CTP: Book 11.6 [trans. 2020: Book 44.6), perhaps in\nresponse to criticism from Confucians such as Mengzi. These changes in\nMohist philosophy indicate significant interaction and adjustment\nbetween the different traditions and have ramifications for an\nimplicit broadening of capacities of the heart-mind conception.\n",
