    "main_text": "Consequences for Whom? Limiting the Demands of Morality\n7. Arguments for Consequentialism\n\nEven if consequentialists can accommodate or explain away common moral\nintuitions, that might seem only to answer objections without yet\ngiving any positive reason to accept consequentialism. However, most\npeople begin with the presumption that we morally ought to\nmake the world better when we can. The question then is only whether\nany moral constraints or moral options need to be added to the basic\nconsequentialist factor in moral reasoning. (Kagan 1989, 1998) If no\nobjection reveals any need for anything beyond consequences, then\nconsequences alone seem to determine what is morally right or wrong,\njust as consequentialists claim.\n\nThis line of reasoning will not convince opponents who remain\nunsatisfied by consequentialist responses to objections. Moreover,\neven if consequentialists do respond adequately to every proposed\nobjection, that would not show that consequentialism is correct or\neven defensible. It might face new problems that nobody has yet\nrecognized. Even if every possible objection is refuted, we might have\nno reason to reject consequentialism but still no reason to accept\nit.\n\nIn case a positive reason is needed, consequentialists present a wide\nvariety of arguments. One common move attacks opponents. If the only\nplausible options in moral theory lie on a certain list (say,\nKantianism, contractarianism, virtue theory, pluralistic intuitionism,\nand consequentialism), then consequentialists can argue for their own\ntheory by criticizing the others. This disjunctive syllogism\nor process of elimination will be only as strong as the set\nof objections to the alternatives, and the argument fails if even one\ncompetitor survives. Moreover, the argument assumes that the original\nlist is complete. It is hard to see how that assumption could be\njustified.\n\nConsequentialism also might be supported by an inference to the\nbest explanation of our moral intuitions. This argument might\nsurprise those who think of consequentialism as counterintuitive, but\nin fact consequentialists can explain many moral intuitions that\ntrouble deontological theories. Moderate deontologists, for example,\noften judge that it is morally wrong to kill one person to save five\nbut not morally wrong to kill one person to save a million. They never\nspecify the line between what is morally wrong and what is not morally\nwrong, and it is hard to imagine any non-arbitrary way for\ndeontologists to justify a cutoff point. In contrast,\nconsequentialists can simply say that the line belongs wherever the\nbenefits most outweigh the costs, including any bad side effects (cf.\nSinnott-Armstrong 2007). Similarly, when two promises conflict, it\noften seems clear which one we should keep, and that intuition can\noften be explained by the amount of harm that would be caused by\nbreaking each promise. In contrast, deontologists are hard pressed to\nexplain which promise is overriding if the reason to keep each promise\nis simply that it was made (Sinnott-Armstrong 2009). If\nconsequentialists can better explain more common moral intuitions,\nthen consequentialism might have more explanatory coherence overall,\ndespite being counterintuitive in some cases. (Compare Sidgwick 1907,\nBook IV, Chap. III; and Sverdlik 2011.) And even if act\nconsequentialists cannot argue in this way, it still might work for\nrule consequentialists (such as Hooker 2000).\n\nConsequentialists also might be supported by deductive\narguments from abstract moral intuitions. Sidgwick (1907, Book III,\nChap. XIII) seemed to think that the principle of utility follows from\ncertain very general self-evident principles, including\nuniversalizability (if an act ought to be done, then every other act\nthat resembles it in all relevant respects also ought to be done),\nrationality (one ought to aim at the good generally rather than at any\nparticular part of the good), and equality (\u201cthe good of any one\nindividual is of no more importance, from the point of view ... of the\nUniverse, than the good of any other\u201d).\n\nOther consequentialists are more skeptical about moral intuitions, so\nthey seek foundations outside morality, either in non-normative facts\nor in non-moral norms. Mill (1861) is infamous for his\n\u201cproof\u201d of the principle of utility from empirical\nobservations about what we desire (cf. Sayre-McCord 2001). In\ncontrast, Hare (1963, 1981) tries to derive his version of\nutilitarianism from substantively neutral accounts of morality, of\nmoral language, and of rationality (cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 2001).\nSimilarly, Gewirth (1978) tries to derive his variant of\nconsequentialism from metaphysical truths about actions.\n\nYet another argument for a kind of consequentialism is\ncontractarian. Harsanyi (1977, 1978) argues that all\ninformed, rational people whose impartiality is ensured because they\ndo not know their place in society would favor a kind of\nconsequentialism. Broome (1991) elaborates and extends\nHarsanyi\u2019s argument.\n\nOther forms of arguments have also been invoked on behalf of\nconsequentialism (e.g. Cummiskey 1996, P. Singer 1993;\nSinnott-Armstrong 1992). However, each of these arguments has also\nbeen subjected to criticisms.\n\nEven if none of these arguments proves consequentialism, there still\nmight be no adequate reason to deny consequentialism. We might have no\nreason either to deny consequentialism or to assert it.\nConsequentialism could then remain a live option even if it is not\nproven.\n",
