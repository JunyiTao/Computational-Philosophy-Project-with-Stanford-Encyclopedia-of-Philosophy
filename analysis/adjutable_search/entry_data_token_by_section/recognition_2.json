Rather, we should distinguish\nbetween a narrow understanding of recognition based on the feature of\nmutuality and a wide understanding grounded in the idea of adequate\nregard (Laitinen 2010). The latter reading emphasizes that by affirming\na valuable feature of any entity (i.e., also of animals and even\ninanimate nature, not only of persons) we properly\n\u2018recognize\u2019 it regardless of whether the recognized object\nrealizes this fact (or is even able to do so). Thus, the wide\nunderstanding allows for many objects of recognition that cannot\nthemselves be subjects of recognition. However, so far this constitutes\na minority position.\n\n\nBy contrast, because most theorists of recognition argue that\nrecognition is a genuinely interpersonal endeavor, they conclude that\nonly subjects of recognition can be proper objects of recognition.\nAt its margins, this narrow understanding of mutual recognition between\npersons raises the question from which point onward children can start\nto be subjects of recognition (and whether at least some animals can\nqualify as such). Most theories of recognition\u2014drawing, for\nexample, on psychoanalytic object-relations theory (see in more detail\n2.4 below)\u2014speak of recognition in the context of the\nrelationship between parents and babies. This suggests, of course, that\nhuman babies face the surrounding world differently than even the most\ndeveloped animals do (see in more detail 2.1 below).\n\n\nWhen it comes to the question of collective agents, there is still\nconsiderable uncertainty within the literature. In the following, this\nentry distinguishes between (i) groups, (ii) corporations or states and\n(iii) institutions more generally. (i) Most authors readily grant that\n(at least certain) groups of persons may be the subject and object of\n(mis)recognition because a group can share collective intentions as\nwell as certain features for which it can be misrecognized (especially\nif these features constitute the group\u2019s self-understanding).\n(ii) It is more contested whether more complex collective actors such\nas corporations or states\u2014to the extent they are thought to\nhave a legal personality\u2014can be regarded as subjects and\nobjects of recognition in the proper sense (see for the latter Rawls\n1999, 34\u201335). For example, there is dissent about whether the\nacts of the \u201ccollective actor\u201d are rather to be understood\nas resulting from the mere aggregation of individual intentions, thus signifying\nindividual acts of (mis)recognition, or whether \nthey display genuinely autonomous collective intentions. Philip Pettit argues for the latter position by pointing out that in order to act reliably (internally and externally) a collective agent\u2019s decisions have to display a certain coherence over time, which is achieved by procedures (Pettit 2007, 180). Recently, there have been attempts\nto introduce the notion of recognition into the field of International\nRelations, beyond the common usage of a legal recognition of states.\nOften enough, it is argued, the (violent) behavior of states cannot be\nreductively understood as a merely instrumental striving for ever more\npower but should (at least also) be perceived as a struggle for\nrecognition (see the contributions in Lindemann/Ringmar 2011, O\u2019Neill/Smith 2012, part III, and Daase et al. 2015). Certainly, citizens frequently speak as if their state was disrespected by another state but it\nremains to be seen whether these citizens are in fact merely indignant\nabout their government being disrespected, some public official or they themselves\nas members of the state (in more detail Iser 2015, 30\u201334). (iii) Finally,\nwhat about institutions more generally? A lot depends on one\u2019s\ndefinition of institutions, which can be part of a state (for example,\na state\u2019s constitution) or transcend state borders (as the\ninstitution of the free global market). Institutions cannot as easily\nbe described as collective actors. Still, given that they are human\nproducts, there is broad agreement that an institution (say, a\nconstitution) can disrespect persons because institutions, besides\neffectively regulating behavior, always express\u2014as well as\nreinforce\u2014underlying attitudes of those who designed or keep on\nreproducing them. In distinguishing between a civilized society where\nindividuals do not humiliate each other and a decent society where at\nleast the institutions do not do so, Avishai Margalit (1996, 1\u20132)\nexplicitly affirms this point. Furthermore, political resistance as a\nmoral endeavor would prove to be unintelligible if we did not assume\nthat political institutions (and not only the agents acting within\nthem) could be subjects of misrecognition. But can institutions\nthemselves be disrespected? Institutions can certainly be disregarded\nbut it may be argued that institutions (similar to values and norms)\nare either \u201cacknowledged\u201d or not whereas it is only persons\nor groups subject to these institutions who can be properly\n\u201c(mis)recognized\u201d as only here (mis)recognition has\nconsequences for the object\u2019s self-conception.\n",
