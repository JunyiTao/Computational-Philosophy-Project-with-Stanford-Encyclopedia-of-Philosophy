In further analyzing the subject\nand predicate idea of a proposition, we will find out, that in special\ncases (as, e.g., in the case of the idea [the judgment that God is\nomnipotent]), a complete proposition will turn out to be a part of an\nidea\u00a0 (WL I, 221). In general, however, the parts of an idea are\nthemselves ideas. After careful consideration Bolzano decided against\nthe view to define a proposition as something constructed out of ideas\n(i.e., as a connection of two arbitrary ideas by means of the copula\n[has]) (WL II, 18); he rather suggested that we define ideas as those\nparts of a proposition which are not themselves propositions (WL I,\n216, WL II, 18). In this sense he granted priority to propositions\nover their non-propositional parts (i.e., ideas), thereby anticipating\nFrege and Wittgenstein. There is a clear demarcation between\npropositions and ideas: Whereas each proposition is either true or\nfalse (WL II, 7), an idea cannot be true or false (WL I, 239 ff.).\nThere are two \u201cdimensions\u201d to be distinguished in each\nidea: its \u201cinternal dimension\u201d, i.e., its divisibility or\nindivisibility into parts, and its \u201cexternal\ndimension\u201d, i.e., its having or not having objects.\n\nAs far as the inner structure of ideas is concerned (WL I,\n243 ff.), Bolzano distinguishes simple from complex ideas: A\nsimple idea has no proper parts, whereas a complex\nidea has. The \u201csum\u201d (Summe) of proper parts of a\ncomplex idea is called its \u2018content\u2019\n(\u2018Inhalt\u2019). Due to Bolzano\u2019s peculiar usage\nof the term \u2018sum\u2019 that is restricted \u2014 like his\nusage of \u2018collection\u2019 in general \u2014 to sets with at\nleast two members, he could not apply his concept of content to all\nideas, but only to complex ideas. In order to simplify matters, we\nwill use here the modern concept of a set, allowing for a set to be a\nsingleton (i.e., containing only one single member) or even to be\nempty (i.e., containing no member at all). In what follows we will\ntherefore take the content of an arbitrary idea to be the\nset of all of its parts (including improper ones, i.e.,\nincluding itself). The content of a simple idea \\(i\\) is then the\nsingleton \\(\\{i\\}\\) containing \\(i\\) itself as its only member. Two\ncomplex ideas \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\) can have the same content, i.e., the\nsame parts, without themselves being identical, because the common\nparts of \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\) can be arranged in different ways in\n\\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\). Bolzano\u2019s favorite example is: [an erudite\nson of an unerudite father] has the same content, but is not identical\nwith [an unerudite son of an erudite father]; the same holds for\n\\([3^5]\\) and \\([5^3]\\) (WL I, 244). In analyzing an idea, we will in\nall cases eventually come upon simple ideas (WL I, 263\u2013265).\nWithout explicitly expressing it, Bolzano obviously held the view that\nevery idea is recursively constructed out of simple ideas. Two ideas\nare therefore identical iff they are constructed out of the same\nsimple ideas in the same way. In order to be able to apply this\ngeneral idea precisely in concrete cases, we would have to be able to\nidentify the simple ideas and the formation rules involved.\nUnfortunately, Bolzano informs us about both only by hinting at\nexamples here and there. As examples of simple ideas he mentions\n[something] (WL I, 447), [has] (WL I, 380, WL II, 18), [non] (WL II,\n415), [Wirklichkeit], i.e., [reality] (WL II, 60), and\n[Sollen], i.e., [ought] (WL II, 69, WL IV, 489).\n\nWith respect to its \u201cexternal\u201d dimension, an idea\ncan have several (may be even infinitely many) objects, exactly one\nobject, or no object at all. An idea that has no object at all is an\nempty idea; Bolzano calls it\n\u2018gegenstandlos\u2019 (\u2018objectless\u2019).\nBolzano puts forward the thesis with particular emphasis that there\nare empty ideas; his standard examples are ideas such as [nothing],\n[golden mountain] (WL I, 304 f., WL II, 329) or [winged horse] (WL\nIII, 24). A special kind of empty ideas, viz. contradictory\nideas (or, as Bolzano usually prefers to call them, imaginary\nideas) cannot even have an object (WL I, 315 ff., WL III, 405\nf.), examples being [a round polygon], [a round square], [a triangle\nthat is quadrangular], [a regular pentagon], [a wooden iron tool], [an\nequilateral rectangular triangle] (WL I, 305, 315, 317, 321, 324, WL\nII, 329). Non-empty ideas are called\n\u2018gegenst\u00e4ndlich\u2019 (\u2018objectual\u2019)\nby Bolzano. They can be singular as, e.g., [the philosopher\nSocrates], [the city of Athens], [the fixed star Sirius] (WL I, 306),\n[an even integer between 4 and 8] (WL III, 407), [God] (WL III, 408),\nor general; if general, they can have a finite number of\nobjects, such as [a heir of Genghis-Khan\u2019s Empire] (WL I, 299)\nor [an integer between 1 and 10] (WL I, 308), or an infinite number of\nobjects, such as [a line] or [an angle] (WL I, 298). For non-empty\nideas (and only for them) Bolzano defines their extension\n(Umfang) (WL I, 297 f.); by using again the modern concept of\na set (as we already did with Bolzano\u2019s definition of the\ncontent of an idea), we can extend his definition to all ideas\nincluding empty ones; the extension of an arbitrary idea \\(i\\) (or\nExt\\((i)\\), as an abbreviation) is then nothing but the set\nof all objects of \\(i\\).\n\nBy crossing the \u201cinternal\u201d with the \u201cexternal\ndimension\u201d of ideas we can get new and interesting\n\u201ccreations\u201d. Combining, e.g., the smallest content with\nthe smallest extension of a non-empty idea results in a new type of\nidea, viz. in an \u201cintuition in itself\u201d or, as we may say\nfor the sake of brevity, an intuition (Anschauung).\nAn intuition is an idea which is simple, i.e., has no proper\npart, and at the same time singular, i.e., has only one single object\n(WL I, 325\u2013330). If an idea is neither itself an intuition nor\ncontains any intuition as a proper part, it is called\n\u2018Begriff\u2019 (\u2018concept\u2019) by\nBolzano; examples of concepts are the simple idea [something] and the\ncomplex idea [God] whereby, for Bolzano, [God] = [the real being that\nhas no cause of its being real]. A mixed idea is a complex\nidea which contains at least one intuition as a proper part (WL I, 330\nf.). The distinction between intuitions and concepts plays an\nimportant role in Bolzano\u2019s epistemology (cf. section 4.2 where\nwe will also present examples of intuitions).\n\nTalking about the \u201cexternal dimension\u201d of ideas, we made\n\u2014 following Bolzano \u2014 intensive usage of a certain\nrelation \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) between ideas and their objects that is basic\nin Bolzano\u2019s theory of ideas. For \u2018\\(i \\mathbf{R}\nx\\)\u2019 we used phrases such as \u2018\\(i\\) is an idea of\n\\(x\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(x\\) is an object of \\(i\\)\u2019; other\nexpressions for it are \u2018\\(i\\) represents \\(x\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(x\\) is subsumed under \\(i\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(x\\) falls\nunder \\(i\\)\u2019 (WL I, 298). The domain of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is the\nset of non-empty ideas, its range being the set of all objects;\nmoreover, \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) has the following properties: it is neither\nreflexive nor irreflexive (the latter due to counterexamples such as:\n[idea] \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) [idea]; cf. WL I, 461), it is neither symmetric\nnor asymmetric, it is neither transitive nor intransitive, and it is\nneither one-many nor many-one. Since, according to our definition,\n\\(Ext(i) = \\{x \\mid i \\mathbf{R} x\\}\\), we can express \u2018\\(i\n\\mathbf{R} x\\)\u2019 also in terms of \u2018extension\u2019 as\n\u2018\\(x \\in\\) \\(Ext(i)\\)\u2019.\n\nBolzano defines a variety of relations between ideas concerning their\nextensions, such as the following ones: An idea \\(i_1\\) is\ncompatible with an idea\\( i_2\\) iff \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\) share\na common object, i.e. \\(Ext(i_1) \\cap\\) \\(Ext(i_2) \\ne \\varnothing\\);\nand \\(i_1\\) is included in \\(i_2\\) (or: \\(i_2\\) includes\n\\(i_1)\\) iff \\(i_1\\) is compatible with \\(i_2\\) and every object of\n\\(i_1\\) is also an object of \\(i_2\\), i.e., \\(Ext(i_1) \\cap\\)\n\\(Ext(i_2) \\ne \\varnothing\\), and \\(Ext(i_1) \\subseteq\\) \\(Ext(i_2)\\).\nIn Bolzano\u2019s theory of ideas, precise correlates are available\nof basic concepts of set theory such as the empty set as well as the\nmembership relation and the relation of inclusion between sets.\nUnfortunately, the clear distinction between membership and inclusion\nin his theory of ideas vanished in his theory of propositions due to\nthe common form \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) of all propositions whereby \\([A]\\) can\nbe not only a singular, but also a general (or an empty) idea.\n\nAlready in his theory of ideas Bolzano used a method which he was very\nproud to have invented: the method of idea-variation. He made the most\nfruitful usage of this method, however, by applying it to whole\npropositions.\n",
