    "main_text": "Francisco de Vitoria and His Disciples\n2. Francisco de Vitoria and His Disciples\n\nFrancisco de Vitoria (1486\u20131546) is usually regarded as a late\nScholastic, who employed Aristotelian thought in his philosophy and\ntheology. Although Spanish Scholastics like Vitoria were primarily\ntheologians, the topics they discussed went far beyond the limits of\ntheology and even of the traditional philosophical companions of\ntheology, such as metaphysics and logic. This is partly because\nDominican theologians had to comment on the Summa theologiae\nof Thomas Aquinas, with all the different topics it covered. The\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw a revival of Thomism in Paris,\nRome and Salamanca. In Rome, Thomas de Vio (Cajetan) wrote the most\ninfluential commentary on the Summa theologiae. In Paris,\nPeter Crockaert, a pupil of John Mair, joined the Dominican order and\nbecame a zealous Thomist. Francisco de Vitoria, who studied in Paris,\nembraced this Thomist revival. When he began teaching in Salamanca in\n1524, he supplemented Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences with\nthe Summa theologiae as a textbook for the study of theology.\nAlthough the University of Salamanca was not a new foundation, Vitoria\nand his disciples, especially Domingo de Soto (1494\u20131560) and\nMelchor Cano (1509\u20131560), transformed it into a center for a\nrevived Scholasticism, applying Thomism to such practical problems as\nthe evangelization of the indigenous populations of the New World and\nthe legality of slavery. In addition, the Dominicans of Castile\ninfluenced the intellectual development of the fledgling Jesuit order,\nwhich produced such luminaries as Luis de Molina (1535\u20131600) and\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez (1548\u20131617).\n\nSome works of these theologians can be seen as vast, overflowing\ncommentaries on a number of questions from the Summa\ntheologiae, especially on topics such as law and justice. Since\nthey were confronted by a rapidly changing universe\u2014a so-called\nNew World, populated by inhabitants who belonged to none of the\ntraditionally known religions, and a globalizing economy (including\nthe slave trade)\u2014they had to deal with new opportunities and new\nproblems, while still considering long-standing questions such as the\nlegitimacy of charging interest. Because they were understood, or\nunderstood themselves, as confessors or as advisors of\nconfessors\u2014Domingo de Soto was Emperor Charles V\u2019s\nconfessor, Luis de Molina declared that he wrote for the confessors of\nthose who hold power\u2014they had to cope with political, economic\nand legal reality, often in a quite detailed manner.\n\nThe authors of the School of Salamanca used traditional tools to deal\nwith the new situations they faced. Besides the overarching influence\nof Thomas Aquinas\u2014who became a Doctor of the Church in 1567 and\nwhose works Ignatius of Loyola had obliged the members of his newly\nfounded Jesuit order to study diligently\u2014they engaged with other\nmedieval traditions, including the glosses to the Decretum\nGratiani (Gratian), Franciscan authors (especially John Duns\nScotus and William of Ockham), Jean Gerson and even Marsilius of\nPadua, a banned author who was not even allowed to be cited, but\nnevertheless had a considerable impact on the conciliarist debate.\nScholastic authors made a creative, instead of philologically correct,\nuse of their authorities, interpreting and explaining them in their\nown sense. Molina and Su\u00e1rez even overtly criticized Thomas\nAquinas and his understanding of law.\n\nVitoria\u2019s thought inevitably depended\u2014but not\nslavishly\u2014on Thomas Aquinas, not only in his commentary on the\nSumma theologiae, but also in his relectiones and\nother writings on law and society. His admiration for \u201cDivus\nThomas\u201d had already begun when he studied and later taught\ntheology at Paris and Valladolid. At Paris, he had assisted in the\npreparation of Crockaert\u2019s edition of the Summa\ntheologiae, published in 1515. His lectures commenting on the\nPrima and the Prima secundae of the Summa\nare lost, but must have been quite successful. His most famous works\nwere published after he was elected to the first chair of theology,\nthe most important professorship in the Spanish kingdom, at the\nUniversity of Salamanca in 1526; and, contrary to the statutes of the\nuniversity, he took the Summa theologiae as the basis for his\nteachings (Vitoria, Vorlesungen 1995, 36). His reflections on\npolitical topics, such as the political status of the Church and the\nConquista in Mexico and South America, were followed\nattentively in the highest circles, even if not always approved, as\nEmperor Charles V\u2019s harsh reaction to Vitoria\u2019s lecture\nDe Indis showed.\n\nVitoria\u2019s health became precarious in the 1540s, and the\ndominant role at Salamanca passed to his disciples. The most important\nof these was Domingo de Soto, who was born in Segovia 1494 of humble\norigins, studied in Alcal\u00e1 and Paris, entered the Dominican\norder before he was thirty and was appointed to the second chair of\ntheology, the Catedra de visperas, at the University of\nSalamanca in 1532. Later he became the prior of the Convent of San\nEsteban in Salamanca and was from 1548\u20131550 confessor to Charles\nV. After this, he returned to the university, where he held the first\nchair of theology. He died at San Esteban in 1560. Together with\nMelchor Cano, another important disciple of Vitoria, who later became\nbishop of the Canary Islands, he participated in the Council of Trent\n(1545\u20131563) by order of Spain\u2019s privy council. Soto,\nalthough without a vote in the council, urged bishops to attend to the\nwork of preaching; and he defended Scholastic theology against\nproposals to suppress it. Before returning to Spain, Soto helped with\nthe preparations for Charles V\u2019s Augsburg Interim (1548), which\nmade concessions to the Protestants. One result of Soto\u2019s\npresence at Trent was his tract De natura et gratia, which\nfocused on the errors of Martin Luther, whose writings he called\n\u201cdiabolic\u201d (Soto, De iustitia et iure VII, qu. 5\nad. 4; Grimm 2017: 64). In addition, he wrote an Apologia\nagainst a fellow Dominican, Ambrosius Catharinus Politus, concerning\nthe certitude of grace.\n\nMelchor Cano was less involved in controversy at Trent, concentrating\ninstead on issues of preaching and sacramental theology; however,\nanother Dominican present at the council, Bartolom\u00e9 Carranza\n(1503\u20131576), the future archbishop of Toledo, participated in\nthe discussion of justification, arguing for \u201ctwofold\njustification\u201d. Carranza was reported to be reading\nLuther\u2019s works, a sign of future troubles in which his\nCommentary on the Christian Catechism was criticized by both\nCano and Soto. Eventually, Carranza was condemned by the Inquisition\nfor his views on nature and grace and underwent a long imprisonment,\ndespite Soto\u2019s efforts to defend him with a more balanced\nopinion, which Carranza cited in his own defense (Tellechea\n1962\u20132012).\n\nVitoria and his disciples engaged in arguments over Spain\u2019s\nrights in the New World. The debate began when the Dominicans in the\nAntilles criticized the conquerors\u2019 treatment of indigenous\npeoples. In a sermon given by the Dominican friar Antonio de\nMontesinos on December 21, the fourth Sunday of Advent 1511, in\nHispaniola (today\u2019s Haiti and Dominican Republic), the Spaniards\nwho attended were told that they lived and died in mortal sin because\nof the cruelties they had inflicted upon the Amerindians. One of his\nlisteners was Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas (1474\u20131566), who\njoined the Dominican order and was converted by Montesinos into the\nmost severe critic of the Conquista (Las Casas, Historia\nde las Indias).\n\nA Junta of Burgos (1513) declared that Charles V had a sound title to\nthe Indies. One argument in that context, grounded in\nAristotle\u2019s thought, was that the Amerindians were slaves by\nnature. This view did not remain uncontested; and, eventually, on 2\nJune 1537, Pope Paul III, influenced by Las Casas, issued the bull\nSublimis Deus, declaring the indigenous peoples to be fully\nhuman with souls and just title to their possessions. The ongoing\ndebate climaxed in the disputation between Las Casas, defending the\nliberty of the indigenous populations, and the humanist Aristotelian\nJuan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda (1494\u20131573), who defended\nthe Spanish title to the Indies because of the Amerindian\u2019s sins\nand because they were slaves by nature. This took place in the Junta\nof Valladolid (1550/51), which Charles V had assembled with a number\nof other leading scholars on both sides.\n",
