What is Metaphysical Realism?\n\nMetaphysical realism is the thesis that the objects, properties and\nrelations the world contains, collectively: the structure of the world\n[Sider 2011], exists independently of our thoughts about it or our\nperceptions of it. Anti-realists either doubt or deny the existence of\nthe structure the metaphysical realist believes in or else doubt or\ndeny its independence from our conceptions of it. Realists about\nnumbers, for example, hold that numbers exist mind-independently. This\nview is opposed by Nominalists who deny the existence of abstract\nobjects and Intuitionists who agree numbers exist, but as mental\nconstructions, denying their mind-independence. Some realists about\nlaws of nature, to take an empirical example, hold that laws are\nrelations between universals [Armstrong 1983], others that laws are\nontologically primitive entities [Maudlin 2007]. Anti-realists about\nlaws of nature, on the other hand, either deny there are any laws at\nall [Cartwright 1983; van Fraassen 1989] or else discern a dependence\non human concepts in the nature of these laws, interpreting them as\nexpressing certain expectations we have about regularities that we\nunconsciously project onto the world [Blackburn 1986]. \n\nMetaphysical realism is not the same as scientific realism. That the\nworld\u2019s constituents exist mind-independently does not entail\nthat its constituents are as science portrays them. One could adopt an\ninstrumentalist attitude toward the theoretical entities posited by\nscience, continuing to believe that whatever entities the world\nactually does contain exist independently of our conceptions and\nperceptions of them. For the same reason, metaphysical realists need\nnot accept that the entities and structures ontologists posit exist\nmind-independently.\n\nHenceforth, we shall often just use the term \u2018realism\u2019 to\nmean metaphysical realism. Opposition to realism can take many forms\nso there is no single theoretical view denoted by the term\n\u2018anti-realism\u2019. In particular, anti-realism is not\nIdealism, even though Idealism is its most recognised form. One\napproach, popular in Continental Philosophy, rejects realism on the\ngrounds that words can only acquire their meaning\nintra-linguistically, through their semantic relations with\nother words, where these relations are grounded in our linguistic and\ncultural practices, rather than through referential relations to the\nworld outside of language. This view, Anti-Representationalism as it\nis sometimes called, has gained traction in analytic philosophy also\n[See Price 2009]. \n\nWithin the ranks of Analytic Philosophy, Verificationists and\nPragmatists also reject realism, though for different reasons. We\nshall mainly focus in this entry on the types of criticism voiced by\nthese two groups of Analytic philosophers with Michael Dummett\nadvocating a certain kind of Verificationism and Hilary Putnam a\ncertain kind of Pragmatism. While accepting Representationalism, both\nDummett and Putnam rejected realism by deploying semantic\nconsiderations in arguments designed to show that realism is\nuntenable. The main goal of this entry is to outline these\n\u2018semantic\u2019 challenges to realism and to review realist\nresponses to them.\n\nThe characterization of realism in terms of mind-independence above is\nnot universally accepted. Some object that mind-independence is\nobscure [e.g. Chalmers 2009; for relevant discussion, see the entry\n ontological dependence].\n Others maintain that realism is committed, in addition, to a\ndistinctive (and tendentious) conception of truth [Putnam 1981, 1985,\n1992; Wright 1993; Button 2013; Taylor 2006] or, more radically, that\nrealism just is a thesis about the nature of truth\u2014that truth\ncan transcend the possibility of verification, ruling statements for\nwhich we can gather no evidence one way or the other to be\ndeterminately either true or false. An example would be \u201cJulius\nCaesar\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he crossed the Rubicon.\u201d\nThus the realist on this view is one who believes the law of bivalence\n(every statement is either true or false) holds for all meaningful\n(non-vague) statements [Dummett 1978, 1991, 1993]. \n\nIn the same vein, Crispin Wright [1992a, 2003] presents a nuanced\nalethic analysis according to which discourses may be more or less\nrealist depending on which distinctive \u2018marks of truth\u2019\nthey satisfy. \n\nThese semantic formulations of metaphysical realism are unacceptable\nto realists who are deflationists about truth, denying that truth is a\nsubstantive notion that can be used to characterise alternative\nmetaphysical views [see the entry on the\n deflationary theory of truth].\n Realists collectively complain, with some justice, that the\nanti-realist arguments are really arguments against the correspondence\n(or other substantive) theory of truth rather than realism [Devitt\n1983, 1991; Millikan 1986]. This is an important reason for preferring\nan ontological construal of realism rather than a semantic one. \n\nThere is, in fact, an obvious worry about using the notion of\nmind-independence to characterise realism: it appears to consign\nmental states and events to irreality. Surely your savouring the taste\nof espresso, say, is dependent on your mind if anything is? Moreover,\njust as certainly the nature and content of the experience of tasting\nespresso depends upon one\u2019s beliefs and expectations. Indeed,\nbut this is not what the \u2018mind-independence\u2019\ncharacterisation of realism means to exclude. Rather, it is the\nexistence of conscious events that is deemed to be\nindependent of the particular opinions or theories we might hold about\ntheir existence \u2014given conscious events do exist, were our\ndescendants to uniformly dismiss them as illusory, they would be\nmistaken. The \u2018mind-independence\u2019 at issue is epistemic\nrather than ontological.\n\nOn this understanding of realism, it is an error to identify realism\nwith factualism, the view that sentences in some discourse or theory\nare to be construed literally as fact-stating ones. The anti-realist\nviews discussed below are factualist about discourse describing\ncertain contentious domains. Adopting a non-factualist or\nerror-theoretic interpretation of some domain of discourse commits one\nto anti-realism about its entities. Factualism is thus a necessary\ncondition for realism. But it is not sufficient. Verificationists such\nas Dummett reject the idea that something might exist without our\nbeing able to recognize its existence. They can be factualists about\nentities such as numbers and quarks while anti-realists about their\nnature since they deny any entities can exist mind-independently.\n\nTo elaborate the notion of mind-independent existence, consider Peter\nvan Inwagen\u2019s argument for the existence of numbers [van Inwagen\n2016], which he describes as \u201ca typical neo-Quinean\nargument\u201d. The argument rests on two Quinean theses, van Inwagen\nrelays. Firstly, that there is only one kind of variable, a variable\nthat occupies nominal position, the range of which is unrestricted.\nSecondly, that the meanings of the quantifiers are\n univocal.[1]\n\nGiven these two background assumptions, the argument he gives is this:\n\n\n There are objects that have both mass and volume.\n The average density of an object that has both mass and volume is\nthe ratio of its mass to its volume.\n So, there is at least one thing that is a ratio.\n Anything that is a ratio is a number.\n Hence, there are numbers.\n\n\n(3) follows from (1) and (2), with the conclusion (5) deducible from\n(1), (2) and (4). Moreover, both (2) and (4) are, if not analytically\ntrue, simple mathematical truths. (1), on the other hand, is an\nempirical fact, van Inwagen notes. The argument is clearly valid and\nthe three premises that support the conclusion are all highly\nplausible. Should we not just accept that numbers exist? Many\nphilosophers think so but some philosophers demur. Amongst the latter\nare those who think that the meaning of \u2018there exists\u2019\nvaries from context to context [Hilary Putnam and Eli Hirsch are two\nprominent advocates whose ideas we review]. There are others who think\nthat the existential quantifier carries no ontological import\n[Azzouni, J. 1997]. If one accepts Quine\u2019s two assumptions about\nthe existential quantifier, however, and regards the argument as\nsound, hasn\u2019t one thereby accepted realism about numbers? \n\nNo. For, while the argument establishes the existence of numbers, if\nit is indeed sound, it leaves their nature unspecified. Hence, it does\nnot prove that numbers exist independently of human (or other) minds.\nMoreover, since the inferences are intuitionistically valid,\nanti-realists can accept it. The argument gives Intuitionists who\nbelieve numbers are mental constructs just as much as Platonists who\nbelieve they are eternal abstract objects a reason to believe numbers\nexist. \n",
