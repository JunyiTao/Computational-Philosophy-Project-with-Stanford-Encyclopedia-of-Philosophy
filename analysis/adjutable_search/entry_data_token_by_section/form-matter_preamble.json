    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle famously contends that every physical object is a compound\nof matter and form. This doctrine has been dubbed\n\u201chylomorphism\u201d, a portmanteau of the Greek words for\nmatter (hul\u00ea) and form (eidos or\nmorph\u00ea). Highly influential in the development of\nMedieval philosophy, Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism has also enjoyed\nsomething of a renaissance in contemporary metaphysics.\n\nWhile the basic idea of hylomorphism is easy to grasp, much remains\nunclear beneath the surface. Aristotle introduces matter and form, in\nthe Physics, to account for changes in the natural world,\nwhere he is particularly interested in explaining how substances come\ninto existence even though, as he maintains, there is no generation\nex nihilo, that is that nothing comes from nothing. In this\nconnection, he develops a general hylomorphic framework, which he then\nextends by putting it to work in a variety of contexts. For example,\nhe deploys it in his Metaphysics, where he argues that form\nis what unifies some matter into a single object, the compound of the\ntwo; he appeals to it in his De Anima, by treating soul and\nbody as a special case of form and matter and by analyzing perception\nas the reception of form without matter; and he suggests in the\nPolitics that a constitution is the form of a polis\nand the citizens its matter, partly on the grounds that the\nconstitution serves to unify the body politic.\n\nHylomorphism thus finds a range of applications across\nAristotle\u2019s corpus. This entry focuses on its genesis and\ndevelopment in the Physics and Metaphysics, in order\nto characterize and assess its fundamental features and core\ncommitments. There is in any case already a considerable controversy\nat this basic level about what Aristotle means by matter and form:\nwhat precisely they are, how they are related to one another, how\nAristotle intends to marshal arguments in support of them, and how\nbest to deal with reasonable objections to their metaphysical\nconsequences. We will begin by examining how Aristotle introduces his\ntwin notions. Then we will move on to discuss some of the most\nimportant interpretative controversies: does Aristotle believe in\nso-called \u201cprime\u201d matter? Does matter or form serve as the\nprinciple of individuation in his metaphysics? Do natural forms\ninclude a specification of the kind of matter that anything of that\nform has to have?\n",
