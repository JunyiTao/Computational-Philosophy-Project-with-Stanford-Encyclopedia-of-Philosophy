    "main_text": "The Monarchia\n7. The Commedia (The Divine Comedy)\n\nFew texts have generated such deep and abiding interest as has the\nDivine Comedy in its nearly centuries of transmission. In\nlarge part, this wealth of attention is a function of the way in which\nthe Divine Comedy seems to gather, in what is often called an\n\u201cencyclopedic\u201d fashion, the entire edifice of classical\npoetry, medieval knowledge (including but not limited to its\nreflections on ethics, political theory, metaphysics, theology,\nbiblical exegesis, literary history, rhetoric, and aesthetics) and to\ncall out to its contemporary and future readers with the perennial\ndemand that they make its encyclopedic interests meaningful in their\nown lives. In part because of this seemingly encyclopedic character,\nbut also because so many of the poetic stratagems of the Divine\nComedy involve irony and outright paradox, any attempt to\nsummarize its philosophical content or significance is to a certain\ndegree an act of folly. In fact all of the themes mentioned in the\ndiscussion of Dante\u2019s three expository treatises above\nconstitute significant themes in Dante\u2019s magnum opus. For this\nreason, rather than attempt to summarize the Divine\nComedy\u2019s treatment of these themes, it may be more useful\nto offer a brief comment on what may be at stake in the question of\nthe relationship between the philosophical content of the Divine\nComedy and its poetic form.\n\nAt the outset, it is worth dispensing with the notion that the\nDivine Comedy rejects philosophy in favor of what appears to\nbe a mystical undertaking. It is, of course, quite true that the\nDivine Comedy condemns even Aristotle, the \u201cmaster of\nthose who know,\u201d to Hell [Inf. 4.131; all translations\nof the Divine Comedy in this entry are those of Robert\nDurling (1996\u20132011)]\u2014specifically to the portion of Limbo\nin which souls of the noble pagans are punished only insofar as\n\u201cwithout hope [they] live in desire\u201d [Inf. 4.42].\nHowever, even if philosophical perfection is, in itself, insufficient\nfor salvation according to the Divine Comedy\u2019s\nspiritual economy, this is not to say that salvation is possible\nwithout philosophy. In other words, the question of what philosophy\nmeans within the world described by the Divine Comedy\nprobably should not rest upon a superficial identification of it\nexclusively with the fates it imagines even for those who are too\neasily taken to be its symbols.\n\nIndeed, already in the Convivio, Dante presents a complicated\nunderstanding of the meaning and scope of philosophy. There, lady\nphilosophy was depicted in books 2 and 3 as offering human beings the\ncapacity for contemplative unity with God through their devotion to\nher. Hence, it is worth recalling a passage mentioned above in which\nDante maintains that\n\nit should be understood that the gaze of this woman was so liberally\nordained for us, not only for seeing the countenance that she reveals\nto us, but for desiring to attain the things she keeps hidden. Thus,\nbecause through her many of those things are seen by means of reason,\nand consequently can be seen, while without her they seem\ninexplicable and miraculous, so we believe through her that every\nmiracle may have its reason in a higher intellect and consequently is\npossible. And here our good faith has its origin; from which comes\nhope, which is desire for what is foreseen; and through this arises\nthe act of charity. Through these three virtues one ascends to\nphilosophize in that celestial Athens, where the Stoics and\nPeripatetics and Epicureans, by the light of eternal truth, in a\nsingle will, concur in total concord one with the other.\n[3.13\u201314]\n\n\nIn this light, it is also worth noting that Dante turns toward the\nauthority of Aristotle in Convivio 4 only after having\n\u201crefrained\u201d from pursuing his desire for the donna\ngentile who embodies philosophy [4.1.8]. And it is noteworthy,\ntoo, that Dante appeals to Aristotle\u2019s authority not about the\nspiritual and metaphysical matters that were the subjects of\ndiscussion in Convivio 2\u20133, but about those that\nconcern the definition of nobility and the role of philosophy in\nethical and political issues\u2014issues that are pertinent only to\nthe question of the pursuit of temporal rather than spiritual goods.\nIn other words, the tension between the role of philosophy in the\nactive life and its potential role for the contemplative life is\nbroached in the Convivio in such a way that hints that the\nDivine Comedy, too, may be structured by the tension between\nits ambitions to make legitimate use of philosophy in these two\nrelated but fundamentally different manners\u2014ways that may even\nbe in tension with each other insofar as pursuit of one end may\nsometimes seem to preclude or require the abandonment of pursuit of\nthe other.\n\nThere are, however, two major complications that hinder any direct\nassessment of the Divine Comedy\u2019s treatment of the\nnature of philosophy. First, there is the question of the how to\ninterpret the explicit doctrinal claims of the various speakers in the\nDivine Comedy. Purgatorio 16, for instance,\nintroduces Marco the Lombard on the terrace of wrath. Marco\u2019s\nspeech to Dante\u2019s pilgrim touches on a variety of philosophical\nsubjects, including a refutation of astral determinism. But the\nculminating lines of his speech do little more than offer a brief\nsummary of the political philosophy espoused in Convivio 4\nand Monarchia. Specifically, Marco offers the following\ndiagnosis of the cause of civil strife in the Italy of Dante\u2019s\nday (Purg., 16.106\u201312):\n\n\nSoleva Roma, che \u2019l buon mondo feo,\n\ndue soli aver, che l\u2019una e l\u2019altra strada\n\nfacean vedere, e del mondo e di Deo.\n\nL\u2019un l\u2019altro ha spento, ed \u00e8 giunta la spade\n\ncol pasturale, e l\u2019un con l\u2019altro insieme\n\nper viva forza mal convien che vada\n\nper\u00f2 che, giunti, l\u2019un l\u2019altro non teme.\n\n[Rome, which made the good world,\n\nused to have two suns that made visible\n\nthe two paths, of the world and of God.\n\nOne sun has extinguished the other,\n\nand the sword is joined to the shepherd\u2019s staff,\n\nand it is ill for those two to be violently forced together,\n\nfor, joined, neither fears the other.]\n\n\nAccordingly, read in light of the Convivio and the\nMonarchia, when Marco asserts in 16.91\u201396 that either a\nguide or reins are necessary to turn human appetite away from base\npleasures so that the human being may be genuinely happy, we may\nunderstand Dante to be endorsing the view that the best case scenario\nfor the cultivation of justice involves a unification of the political\nauthority of the emperor, whose laws operate as \u201creins\u201d on\nhuman desire, with the authority of the intrinsic\n\u201cguidance\u201d that philosophy provides in its concerns with\nmatters of ethics.\n\nNevertheless, as straightforward as Marco\u2019s speech seems to be\nat this juncture, the careful reader will keep in mind that the\nspeaker may be undergoing penance because his own sense of devotion to\njustice fostered in him wrath towards others who did not share his\nvalues\u2014and in an unjust world, this would mean that\nMarco\u2019s love of valor [16.47] would have made charity difficult\nfor him. In other words, even though it is true that Marco\u2019s\nspeech recapitulates key arguments of Convivio 4 and\nMonarchia, the dramatic context for the speech introduces\nsome doubt as to whether we are meant to understand this speech as an\nunqualified endorsement for those positions. And, of course, this\nproblem\u2014the interpretive problem posed by the significance of\nthe dramatic context for the various speeches in the Divine\nComedy\u2014is an inescapable feature of the hermeneutic\nframework within which philosophical (and theological) doctrines are\noffered for our consideration.\n\nThe second basic complication that hinders any straightforward\nassessment of the Divine Comedy\u2019s treatment of the\nnature of philosophy is that Dante\u2019s choice to deploy Beatrice\nas the ultimate and explicit guarantor of the veracity and salvific\npotential of the text invokes and transforms the meaning of his entire\ncorpus of writings. That is, because Beatrice and donna\ngentile are simultaneously real women and yet also allegorical\ntropes as early as the Vita Nuova, the Divine\nComedy\u2019s reinvention of Beatrice calls upon the reader to\nreturn to Dante\u2019s earlier texts while also hindering any clear\nsense of what those texts have to offer in terms of their claims on\nthe reader\u2019s interpretation of the Divine Comedy.\nMoreover, it must also be kept in mind that the Divine\nComedy\u2019s pilgrim is a fictionalized depiction of the same\nperson who, relative to the setting of the Divine Comedy, had\nalready written the Vita Nuova but had not yet begun writing\nthe Convivio, the De vulgari eloquentia, and the\nMonarchia, and this also contributes to the strange\nrelationship that the Divine Comedy constructs between itself\nand Dante\u2019s prior writings. Indeed, a great deal of scholarly\nattention and debate has centered around a handful of passages in the\nDivine Comedy that may be considered palinodes to Vita\nNuova and Convivio [see, for example, Freccero 1973;\nHollander 1975, 1990; Jacoff, 1980; Pertile 1993; Scott 1990, 1991,\n1995; Ascoli 1995; Dronke 1997; and Aleksander 2011a].\n\nHowever, even if these two complications both hinder any\nstraightforward assessment of the the Divine Comedy\u2019s\nunderstanding of the nature of philosophy, they permit a more modest\nconclusion about one of the fundamental features of the poem. That is,\nif it is safe to say that the dramatic context that unfolds in the\nrelationship between Beatrice and the pilgrim troubles our attempts to\nunderstand the Divine Comedy\u2019s treatment of philosophy,\nthen it is nevertheless also safe to say that there is a philosophical\nlesson to be derived from the way in which the text troubles\nour attempts to understand it. In particular, even while the\nDivine Comedy explicitly defends the superiority of a\ncontemplative path to salvation, nevertheless the poem also stimulates\nthe will of the reader by confronting her with the unsettling\nrealization that the doctrinal content defended in the poem\u2019s\nexplicitly philosophical register is to a certain extent illusory in\nits veracity and therefore of questionable value to the attempt to\nfollow the intellectual path that is mapped out in that register.\nFortunately, this illusory nature of the doctrinal content may be\nirrelevant to the way in which the reader\u2019s engagement with the\npoem actually generates meaning through a process that does, in any\ncase, always demand rigorous philosophical thinking. This is because\nthe poem is structured by the conviction that there can be no hope of\nachieving any of our possible perfections without constantly exposing\nourselves, especially in our shared activity of reading, to the\nanxious experience of wonder\u2014an experience that is heightened\nand sustained by simultaneously striving for philosophical rigor and\nacknowledging it limitations.\n",
