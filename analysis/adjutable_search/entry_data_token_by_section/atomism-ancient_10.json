    "main_text": "Ancient Greek Atomism || Atomism and Particle Theories in Ancient Greek Sciences\n2.6 Atomism and Particle Theories in Ancient Greek Sciences\n\nSome figures concerned with the natural sciences, especially medicine,\nare thought to have regarded organic bodies as composed of particles.\nGalen (2nd c. CE), in On the Natural Faculties, divides\nmedical theorists into two groups, following the division of natural\nphilosophers. On the one side are continuum theorists, who hold that\nall matter is infinitely divisible but that all the matter in things\nsubject to generation and corruption is susceptible to qualitative\nalteration. On the other are those who suppose that matter is composed\nof tiny, unchangeable particles separated by void spaces, and explain\nqualitative change as produced only in compound bodies, by\nrearrangement of the particles alone. In Galen\u2019s view,\nqualitative alteration is needed to produce the powers whereby\nbeneficent Nature directs change: Galen credits the first group with\nasserting the priority of Nature and its beneficent order, and the\nlatter with denying this.\n\nAlthough ancient Greek natural philosophers tend to fall on either\nside of Galen\u2019s divide (Furley 1987)\u2014continuum theory plus\nbeneficent teleology, vs. atomism plus blind necessity\u2014 there is\na danger in taking this dichotomy to be exhaustive or exclusive of\npossible natural philosophies. Inasmuch as the view Plato develops in\nTimaeus is atomistic and also endorses teleological\nexplanation, for example, his position complicates the picture, and\nother theories of natural philosophy in the Hellenistic period do not\ndivide so neatly onto one side or the other. Comparison to other\ntraditions makes clear that atomism has no necessary affinity to the\nabsence of divine organization. Galen has polemical interests in\ndiscrediting those who deny the need for qualitatively irreducible\nfaculties or powers employed by Nature to produce beneficial\nresults.\n\nA prevailing tendency in modern scholarship to identify particle\ntheories with \u2018mechanistic\u2019 thinking is not representative\nof ancient atomism: the identification of Greek atomism as a precursor\nto the New Science was due to the work of 17th century figures like\nPierre Gassendi, Henry More and Robert Boyle. Galen elsewhere\nexplicitly contrasts atomist thought with the schools who appeal to\nexplanations from mechanics (Berryman 2002). Galen\u2019s\npresentation of Greek natural philosophy was important in the later\nreception of ideas into Islamic philosophy (Langermann 2009) and the\nRenaissance (Copenhaver 1998).\n\nThe theories of Heracleides of Pontus (4th c. BCE) and Asclepiades of\nBythnia (2nd c. BCE) are sometimes likened to atomism (Gottschalk\n1980; Vallance 1990). Both\u2014a pupil of Plato, and a medical\ntheorist\u2014are said to have posited the existence of corpuscles\nthey call anarmoi onkoi, likely some kind of partless masses:\nthe precise meaning is uncertain. Although the theories of Asclepiades\nin particular are often assimilated to atomism, it may be that\nGalen\u2019s characterization of this view is polemical, and that\nAsclepiades\u2019 particles are capable of division. Galen is the\nsource for a distinctive argument against the idea that atoms were\nalike in substance, based on the Hippocratic idea that organisms\ncomposed of a single substance would not be able to experience\nsensations like pain (Leith 2014). Ironically, Galen\u2019s theory of\nthe four elements was sometimes interpreted as an atomist theory by\nmedieval sources (Langermann 2009).\n\nOne of the most prominent writers on mechanics in antiquity, Hero of\nAlexandria (1st c. CE), is sometimes regarded, following Hermann\nDiels, as an atomist in the Democritean tradition. In the introduction\nto his Pneumatica, Hero describes matter as made up of\nparticles with spaces between them. However, Hero\u2019s account of\npneumatic effects involving compression of air seems to depend on the\ndeformation of elastic particles which can be compressed artificially\nbut will spring back to their original shape quite vehemently. If so,\nhis account denies a fundamental tenet of classical atomism, that\natoms do not change in their intrinsic properties like shape (Berryman\n2011). Pneumatics, because its effects were thought to depend on\nforces acting against a void, provided stimulus to discussions of the\npossibility of void and why its supposed impossibility would cause\nwater to move against its natural direction. In late antiquity, John\nPhiloponus theorized that void must be at least theoretically possible\nfor these effects to occur (Sedley 1987).\n",
