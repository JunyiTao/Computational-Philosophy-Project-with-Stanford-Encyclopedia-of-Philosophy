    "main_text": "States of Affairs as Complexes || Non-Mereological Composition to the Rescue?\n5.2 Non-Mereological Composition to the Rescue?\n\nThe last point cuts both ways. Why not say that different complex\nobjects can have the same parts? Armstrong (1997: 118) answered this\nquestion positively and argued that facts are non-mereological\ncomposites. Lewis has denied that there is room for non-mereological\ncomposition (see Lewis 1992: 213; for discussion McDaniel 2009).\nHowever, independently of considerations about states of affairs we\nallow for different wholes that share all their parts. For instance,\nthe sentences \u201cJohn loves Mary\u201d and \u201cMary loves\nJohn\u201d both consist of the same words \u201cJohn\u201d,\n\u201cMary\u201d and \u201cloves\u201d, yet they are clearly\ndifferent sentences.\n\nBut our intuitive notion of part does not allow for wholes with only\none part: if something x is part of a whole W, there is\na remainder of W that is not identical with x. To\nillustrate: If you tell me that this slice is part of your cake, but\nthere is no distinct, further part of your cake, I will take you to\nmake joke or to be confused. The remainder principle is implied by the\nsupplementation principle of mereology, but not the other way around\n(see\n mereology\n entry, sect. 3.2) Hence, we can draw on the remainder principle\nwithout endorsing the stronger supplementation principle. Now there\nseem to be states of affairs that \u201ccontain\u201d only one\nproperty (see Bynoe 2011 who argues the following point in detail).\nBradley\u2019s Regress which was discussed in\n section 3.1\n seems to show that the state of affairs Socrates\u2019 being\nwise consists only of Socrates and being wise. There is\nno relation that ties them to a state of affairs. Otherwise the\nquestion would arise what relates this relation to Socrates and\nbeing wise. Now some properties instantiate themselves:\nidentity is self-identical. Hence, the state of affairs\nidentity\u2019s being self-identical obtains. But this state\nof affairs contains only the property of identity. There seems to be\nno intuitively acceptable sense of \u201cpart\u201d in which such\nstates of affairs have parts.\n\nWe are back then to the problem of how to make sense of how a state of\naffairs involves properties and particulars. In order to solve it, we\nneed to find a relation between the state of affairs\na\u2019s being F and a and being\nF that (i) does not make a and being F\nparts of the state of affairs, (ii) allows one to distinguish\nbetween necessarily co-obtaining states of affairs, and (iii)\ndistinguishes the state of affairs a\u2019s being\nF from other objects that, intuitively speaking, involve\na and being F.\n",
