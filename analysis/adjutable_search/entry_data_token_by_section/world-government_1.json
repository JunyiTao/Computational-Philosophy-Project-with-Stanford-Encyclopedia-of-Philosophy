    "main_text": "Debates in Contemporary Political Theory || International Relations Theory\n2.1 International Relations Theory\n\nContemporary international relations theory developed out of the\nurgent need to explain and predict the causes of war and peace in\nworld politics. International relations theory has also developed in\nresponse to globalization, which has wrought \u201cfundamental\nchanges in the spatial and temporal contours of social\nexistence\u201d (Scheuerman 2002 [2018]), characterized by the uneven\nincrease and intensification of social interconnectedness, economic\nintegration, and the \u201cshrinkage of geographic distance on a\nworld scale\u201d (Keohane 2001). While much of international\nrelations theory\u2019s approach to world government has remained\nfocused on the problem of overcoming interstate anarchy for the sake\nof human security in the face of common global threats, a\n\u201cglobal politics paradigm\u201d (Z\u00fcrn 2018) has emerged\nwhich understands world government as only one possible institutional\ndevelopment among others in a system of global governance\ncharacterized by the co-constitution of transnational, international\nand domestic realms of politics and political contestation.\n\nContemporary international \u201crealists\u201d or\n\u201cneorealists\u201d claim not to evaluate the contemporary\nstates system in normative terms. They liken the international order\nto a Hobbesian state of nature, where notions of justice and injustice\nhave no place, and in which each unit is rationally motivated to\npursue every means within its power to assure its own survival, even\nat the expense of others\u2019 basic interests. Some realists have\nthus held that ideas of world government constitute exercises in\nutopian thinking, and are utterly impractical as a goal for human\npolitical organization. Assuming that world government would lead to\ndesirable outcomes such as perpetual peace, realists are skeptical\nthat world government will ever materialize as an institutional\nreality, given the problems of egoistic or corrupted human nature, or\nthe logic of international anarchy that characterizes a world of\nstates, all jealously guarding their own sovereignty or claims to\nsupreme authority. World government is thus infeasible as a solution\nto global problems because of the unsurpassable difficulties of\nestablishing \u201cauthoritative hierarchies\u201d at the global or\ninternational level (Krasner 1999: 42). Furthermore, Kenneth Waltz, in\nhis seminal account of neorealism, Theory of International\nPolitics, clearly favors a system of sovereign states over a\nworld government (1979: 111\u20132). World government, according to\nWaltz, would not deliver universal, disinterested, impartial justice,\norder or security, but like domestic governments, it would be driven\nby its own particular or exclusive organizational interests, which it\nwould pursue at the expense of the interests and freedom of states.\nThis realist view thus provides a sobering antidote to liberal and\nother progressive narratives that foretell peace through\ninterdependence.\n\nWilliam Scheuerman has argued (2011: 67\u201397), however, that\nso-called \u201cclassical\u201d realists of the mid-twentieth\ncentury were more sympathetic to ideas of global institutional reform\nthan contemporary realists. \u201cClassical\u201d and\n\u201cprogressive\u201d realists such as Reinhold Niebuhr, E.H.\nCarr, and Hans Morgenthau, as well as John Herz and Frederick Schuman,\nsupported a global reformist agenda, prompted by the advent of\neconomic globalization, technological change, modern total warfare,\nand the nuclear revolution. Although a desirable end-goal, the\nfeasibility of global political change towards a world government in\nthe form of a global federal system, according to Reinhold Niebuhr,\nwould depend on deeper global social integration and cohesion than was\nevident in the mid-twentieth century (Scheuerman 2011: 73). In\naddition, Niebuhr was concerned that absent the required social and\ncultural basis for global political unity, the achievement of world\ngovernment would be undesirable, since in such conditions, a world\ngovernment would require authoritarian devices to rule, raising the\nspecter of a global tyrannical power (72\u20136). Others, such as\nJames Burnham, posited that a world state could only arise through\nimperial conquest (Deudney 2019). Despite these caveats, realist\nprudence-based as well as functional arguments for a Weberian world\nstate have gained traction again (Cabrera 2010; Ula\u015f 2016; Araujo\n2018; Craig 2019).\n\n\u201cInternational society\u201d theorists, or the \u201cEnglish\nschool\u201d, argue that although there is no central overriding\nauthority above sovereign states, their relations are not wholly\nlawless or devoid of authoritative and enforceable norms and rules for\nconduct. The anarchy between states does not preclude the concept of a\nnorm-governed society of states (Bull 1977). Since\n\u201cinternational society\u201d theorists do not see the absence\nof a central global authority as necessitating a state-eat-state\nworld, they regard the idea of world government as unnecessary, and\npotentially dangerous, since it may serve as a cloak in the struggle\nfor imperial domination between states. Martin Wight has noted that\nthe moral ideals of cosmopolitanism typically translate in practice\ninto political tyranny and imperialism (1991). As an alternative to\nworld government, and echoing both Rousseau and Kant, Chris Brown\nforwards\n\n\nthe ideal of a plurality of morally autonomous, just communities\nrelated to one another in a framework of peace and law. (1995:\n106)\n\n\nEstablishing an international society, ideally conceived, would make a\nsupreme world government unnecessary. Andrew Hurrell, however, argues\nthat\n\n\nit is important to recognize the extent to which social, environmental\nand, above all, technological change is likely to affect the\nscale of governance challenges, the sources of\ncontrol and governance, and the subjects of control. (2007:\n293)\n\n\nFor these reasons, Hurrell does not consider a retreat to a\ntraditional state-based pluralism to be feasible, but argues that the\ndevelopment of a \u201cstable, effective and legitimate international\nsociety\u201d requires redressing global inequality through the\nsignificant redistribution of political power to buttress the\ncollective political agency of the weak and marginalized (2007:\n318).Liberal internationalist accounts of world order are motivated by\nmore than just the traditional preoccupation with problems of war and\npeace. This school of international relations thought, more than the\npreceding two, is explicitly critical of traditional accounts of state\nsovereignty. Richard Falk has depicted the contemporary world order as\none of \u201cinhumane governance\u201d, identifying the following\nills: global severe poverty affecting more than one billion human\nbeings, denial of human rights to socially and culturally vulnerable\ngroups, the persistent use and threat of war as an instrument of\npolitics, environmental degradation, and the lack of transnational\ndemocratic accountability (1995: 1\u20132). A liberal\ninternationalist agenda is advanced when progress is made on\nalleviating or correcting these ills. However, Falk is explicit\nthat\n\n\nhumane governance can be achieved without world government,\nand that this is both the more likely and more desirable course of\naction. (1995: 8)\n\n\nBy world government, Falk means a form of global political\norganization that has, at minimum, the following features:\n\n\ncompulsory peaceful settlement of all disputes by third-party decision\nin accordance with law; general and complete disarmament at the state\nand regional levels; a global legislative capacity backed up by\nenforcement capabilities; and some form of centralized leadership.\n(1995: 7)\n\n\nInstead of world government, Falk calls for \u201ctransnational\ndemocratic initiatives\u201d from global civil society as well as\nUnited Nations reform, both of which would challenge and complement\nthe statist and market forces that currently produce our contemporary\nglobal ills (1995: 207). Most liberal international theorists thus\nenvision the need for authoritative international and global\ninstitutions that modify significantly the powers and prerogatives\ntraditionally attributed to the sovereign state.\n\nAnne-Marie Slaughter has also rejected the idea of cosmopolitan\ndemocracy and a global parliament as infeasible and unwieldy (2004: 8\nand 238). Slaughter is an advocate of \u201cglobal governance\u201d,\nin the sense of \u201ca much looser and less threatening concept of\ncollective organization and regulation without coercion\u201d, to\nsolve common global problems such as transnational crime, terrorism,\nand environmental destruction (2004: 9). According to Slaughter,\nstates are not unitary, but \u201cdisaggregated\u201d and\nincreasingly \u201cnetworked\u201d through information, enforcement,\nand harmonization networks (2004: 167)\u2014producing\n\n\na world of governments, with all the different institutions that\nperform the basic functions of governments\u2014legislation,\nadjudication, implementation\u2014interacting both with each other\ndomestically and also with their foreign and supranational\ncounterparts. (2004: 5)\n\n\nA networked world order, she argues,\n\n\nwould be a more effective and potentially more just world order than\neither what we have today or a world government in which a set of\nglobal institutions perched above nation-states enforced global rules.\n(2004: 6\u20137)\n\n\nAlthough Slaughter is keen to highlight the promise of \u201cglobal\ngovernance through government networks\u201d as \u201cgood public\npolicy for the world and good national foreign policy\u201d (2004:\n261), she acknowledges that in contemporary world conditions of\nradical social, economic and political inequality between states and\npeoples, effective and fair global governance will require the\nnetworks comprising global governance to abide by the norms of\n\u201cglobal deliberative equality\u201d, toleration of reasonable\nand legitimate difference, and \u201cpositive comity\u201d in the\nform of consultation and active assistance between organizations; in\naddition, global governance networks would need to be made more\naccountable through a system of checks and balances, and more\nresponsive through the principle of subsidiarity (2004: 244\u201360).\nWithout movement towards a more equitable world of mutual respect,\nhowever, it is difficult to see actually existing global governance\nnetworks operating in an impartial and generous spirit to help\n\n\nall nations and their peoples to achieve greater peace, prosperity,\nstewardship of the earth, and minimum standards of human dignity.\n(2004: 166)\n\n\nIn this vein, Thomas Weiss has lamented the intellectual and political\nshifts in perspective from world government to global governance,\narguing that current voluntary associations, organizations and\nnetworks at the global level are \u201cso obviously inadequate\u201d\nto meeting global challenges that we\n\n\nare obliged to ask ourselves whether we can approach anything that\nresembles effective governance for the world without institutions with\nsome supranational characteristics at the global level. (2009:\n264)\n\n\nWhile many contemporary international relations theorists seem to\nreject the feasibility, desirability, or necessity of world\ngovernment, constructivist theorist Alexander Wendt has argued that\nthe \u201clogic of anarchy\u201d contains within it the seeds of\ntransformation towards a \u201cglobal monopoly on the legitimate use\nof organized violence\u2014a world state\u201d (2003: 491). Using\nAristotelian and Hegelian insights, Wendt offers a teleological\naccount of the development of world order from an anarchic states\nsystem to a world state, arguing that\n\n\nthe struggle for recognition between states will have the same outcome\nas that between individuals, collective identity formation and\neventually a state. (2003: 493)\n\n\nTechnological changes, especially those that increase the \u201ccosts\nof war\u201d as well as \u201cthe scale on which it is possible to\norganize a state\u201d, affect the struggle for recognition among\nstates, undermining their self-sufficiency and making a world state\n\u201cinevitable\u201d (2003: 493\u20134). Wendt draws on the work\nof Daniel Deudney (1995 and 1999), who argued that the evolution of\ndestructive technology makes states as vulnerable as individuals in a\nHobbesian state of nature:\n\n\nHence nuclear one-worldism\u2014just as the risks of the state of\nnature made it functional for individuals to submit to a common power,\nchanges in the forces of destruction increasingly make it functional\nfor states to do so as well. (Wendt 2003: 508)\n\n\nDeudney, however, has recently argued that the world state solution,\ninvolving a top-down hierarchical mode of government, is impractical\nand conceptually dead; his proposed alternative is a\n\u201cnegarchic\u201d, republican-federalist conception of world\norder that solves the problems of anarchy through the development of\nregimes of mutual restraint and obligation, but without the risk of\ndespotism or totalitarianism accompanying hierarchical world\ngovernment (2019 and 2020).\n\nAccording to Wendt, however, the path of world state formation is\ninevitable, and would be characterized by the emergence of \u201ca\nuniversal security community\u201d, in which members expect to\nresolve conflicts peacefully rather than through force; a\n\u201cuniversal collective security\u201d system that ensures the\nprotection of each member should \u201ccrimes\u201d occur; and a\n\u201cuniversal supranational authority\u201d that can make binding\nauthoritative decisions about the collective use of force (2003: 505).\nDriving this transformation is the struggle for recognition, and\nthe\n\n\npolitical development of the system will not end until the\nsubjectivity of all individuals and groups is recognized and protected\nby a global Weberian state. (2003: 506; for a critique of teleological\narguments about institutional forms, see Levy 2020)\n\n\nWendt recognizes that powerful states enjoying the benefits of\nasymmetrical recognition may be most resistant to world state\nformation. He argues, however, that with the diffusion of greater\nviolence potential to smaller powers (such as al-Qaeda and North\nKorea),\n\n\nthe ability of Great Powers to insulate themselves from global demands\nfor recognition will erode, making it more and more difficult to\nsustain a system in which their power and privileges are not tied to\nan enforceable rule of law. (2003: 524)\n\n\nBased on the assumption that systems tend to develop toward stable\nend-states, a world state in which individuals and\n\n\nstates alike will have lost the negative freedom to engage in\nunilateral violence, but gained the positive freedom of fully\nrecognized subjectivity. (2003: 525)\n\n\nis the inevitable end-state of the human struggle for recognition. At\nthe same time that Wendt sees world state formation as an inevitable\ntrajectory of the struggle for recognition between individuals and\ngroups, he argues that a world state could take various forms: while\ncollectivizing organized violence, it need not collectivize on a\nglobal scale culture, economy or local politics; while requiring a\nstructure that \u201ccan command and enforce a collective response to\nthreats\u201d, it need not abolish national armies, or require a\nsingle UN army; and while it requires a procedure for making binding\nchoices,\n\n\nit would not even require a world \u201cgovernment\u201d, if by this\nwe mean a unitary body with one leader whose decisions are final.\n(2003: 506)\n\n",
