Aesthetic Categories and Feminist Critiques\n\nThe foregoing has reviewed feminist reflections on theories of art,\nnoting how the histories of women in the arts inform contemporary\nfeminist debates and practices. Equally important are assessments of\nthe values that comprise the conceptual frameworks of aesthetics, from\nwhich some of the most influential tools of feminist critical analysis\nemerge.\n\nA good deal of feminist criticism has been focused on\neighteenth-century philosophy because of the many influential works on\nbeauty, pleasure, and taste that were written at that time and that\nbecame foundational texts for contemporary theories.\n\u201cTaste\u201d refers to a capacity that permits good judgments\nabout art and the beauties of nature. While the metaphor for\nperception is taken from the gustatory sense, these theories are\nactually about visual, auditory, and imaginative pleasure, since it is\nwidely assumed that literal taste experience is too bodily and\nsubjective to yield interesting philosophical problems. Judgments of\ntaste take the form of a particular kind of pleasure\u2014one that\neventually became known as \u201caesthetic\u201d pleasure (a term\nthat entered English only in the early nineteenth century).\n\nThe major theoretical concepts of this period are riddled with\ngendered significance, although tracing gender in the maze of writings\nof this time is a task complicated by the unstable role of sexuality\nin theories of aesthetic pleasure. According to its most austere\nanalysis\u2014which came to dominate aesthetics and philosophy of art\nfor a time\u2014aesthetic enjoyment has nothing to do with sexuality\nat all: Aesthetic pleasure is not a sensuous, bodily gratification; it\nis free from practical considerations and purged of desire. The two\nkinds of desire that most interrupt aesthetic contemplation are hunger\nand sexual appetite, which are the \u201cinterested\u201d pleasures\npar excellence. Aesthetic pleasures are contemplative and\n\u201cdisinterested\u201d (to use Kant\u2019s term from the\nCritique of Judgment, 1790). It is disinterestedness that rids\nthe perceiver of the individual proclivities that divide people in\ntheir judgments and that clears the mind for common, even universal\nagreement about objects of beauty. Ideally, taste is potentially a\nuniversal phenomenon, even though its \u201cdelicacy,\u201d as Hume\nput it, requires exercise and training. To some degree, the\nrequirements of taste may be seen as bridging the differences among\npeople. But there is an element of leisure embedded in the values of\nfine art, and critics have argued that taste also ensconces and\nsystematizes class divisions (Shusterman 1993; Mattick 1993).\n\nEven as theorists extolled the possibilities for universal taste,\nhowever, they often drew gender distinctions regarding its exercise.\nMany theorists argued that women and men possess systematically\ndifferent tastes or capabilities for appreciating art and other\ncultural products. The most noticeable gender distinctions occur with\nthe two central aesthetic categories of the eighteenth century, beauty\nand sublimity. Objects of beauty were described as bounded, small, and\ndelicate\u2014\u201cfeminized\u201d traits. Objects that are\nsublime, whose exemplars are drawn chiefly from uncontrolled nature,\nare unbounded, rough and jagged,\nterrifying\u2014\u201cmasculinized\u201d traits. These gender\nlabels are unstable, however, for the terrors of nature have an\nequally strong history of description as \u201cfeminine\u201d forces\nof chaos (Battersby 1998). What is more, gendered meanings in the\nsublime are intensified by surrounding discourse about the strange,\nexotic, and foreign. Meg Armstrong argues that \u201cexotic\u201d\nbodies become subjected to aesthetic discourse in theories of the\nsublime, noting that Burke singles out the black female body as a\nspecial object of terror (Armstrong 1996). In short, aesthetic\nobjects take on both gendered and racialized meanings with\nthe concepts of beauty and sublimity (Bindman 2002). Moreover, so do\naesthetic appreciators. As Kant put it in his earlier\nObservations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\n(1763), a woman\u2019s mind is a \u201cbeautiful\u201d mind. But a\nwoman is incapable of the tougher appreciation and insight that\nsublimity discloses (Wiseman 1993, Kneller 1993). The preclusion of\nwomen from the experience of the sublime limits their competence to\napprehend the moral and existential weight of the might and magnitude\nof both nature and art. Women\u2019s supposed weaker constitutions\nand moral limitations, as well as their social restrictions,\ncontributed to a concept of sublimity that marks it as masculine.\nDebates over the nature and concept of sublimity gave rise to feminist\ndebates over whether one can discern in the history of literature an\nalternate tradition of sublimity that counts as a \u201cfemale\nsublime\u201d (Freeman 1995, 1998; Battersby 1998, 2007; Mann\n2006).\n\nThe careful purging of sensual pleasure from aesthetic enjoyment\nmingles with the paradoxical employment of female bodies as examples\nof aesthetic objects. Among the things that are naturally agreeable to\nhuman nature, Hume lists music, good cheer, and \u201cthe fair\nsex.\u201d And Kant states, \u201cThe man develops his own taste\nwhile the woman makes herself an object of everybody\u2019s\ntaste.\u201d (Kant 1798 [1978: 222]) Edmund Burke frankly eroticizes\nbeauty when he speculates that the grace and delicacy of line that\nmark beautiful objects are reminiscent of the curves of the female\nbody (Burke 1757/1968). If women are the objects of aesthetic\npleasure, then the actual desire of the perceiver must be distanced\nand overcome in order for enjoyment to be purely aesthetic. This\noutcome is one implication of the notion of disinterested pleasure.\nThis requirement, it would seem, assumes a standard point of view that\nis masculine and heterosexual. But of course women are also subjects\nwho exercise taste. This implies that women are unstably both\naesthetic subject and object at the same time. As a rule, the\nconnoisseur, the so-called man of taste, was indeed male, and female\nbodies\u2014in reality or represented in art\u2014figured among the objects of\naesthetic pleasure. However, women were also participants in the\ndevelopment of aesthetic ideals, and Terry Robinson argues that they\nactively shaped the concept of the beautiful female body (T. Robinson\n2018).\n\nDisinterestedness has a long history; it characterizes the popular\naesthetic attitude theories of the twentieth century, which argued\nthat a prerequisite for any kind of full appreciation of art is a\ndistanced, relatively contemplative stance towards a work of art.\nSimilar assumptions about the most suitable way to view art lie behind\nthe formalist criticism that dominated visual art interpretation for\ndecades, and that also characterize interpretive norms in other art\nforms such as literature and music (McClary 1991, 4; Devereaux 1998;\nBrand 2000). The value of disinterested aesthetic enjoyment has come\nunder heavy critical scrutiny on the part of feminists. Some have\ndeconstructed this idea and argued that a supposedly disinterested\nstance is at least sometimes actually a covert and controlling\nvoyeurism and as such ought to be abandoned as an aesthetic ideal.\nOthers caution against discarding standards of disinterested,\nimpartial judgment altogether, arguing that such a move relinquishes\nthe important normativity of aesthetic evaluations (Eaton 2008, 2012).\nNonetheless, even if disinterestedness and related standards of\nobjectivity are retained, feminists continue to draw attention to the\nways in which the mere act of looking can manifest relations of social\npower. Anne Eaton proposes an alternative notion of\n\u201csituatedness,\u201d importing into aesthetics a version of\nfeminist standpoint theory to draw attention both to audience\npositions of appreciation and to the perspectives evoked in works of\nart (Eaton 2009).\n\nCriticisms of theories that mandate disinterested or distanced\naesthetic enjoyment have given rise to influential feminist theories\nof the perception and interpretation of art. The type of art that has\ncome in for particular scrutiny in terms of the implications of\ndisinterested enjoyment is visual art, and a good deal of argument\nabout what has become known as \u201cthe male gaze\u201d has been\nproduced by film theorists and art historians, and subsequently\ninvestigated by philosophers. The phrase \u201cmale gaze\u201d\nrefers to the frequent framing of objects of visual art so that the\nviewer is situated in a \u201cmasculine\u201d position of\nappreciation. By interpreting objects of art as diverse as paintings\nof the nude and Hollywood films, these theorists have concluded that\nwomen depicted in art are standardly placed as objects of attraction\n(much as Burke had lined up women as the original aesthetic object);\nand that the more active role of looking assumes a counterpart\nmasculine position. As Laura Mulvey puts it, women are assigned the\npassive status of being looked-at, whereas men are the active subjects\nwho look (Mulvey 1989). Art works themselves prescribe ideal viewing\npositions. While many women obviously also appreciate art, the stance\nthey assume in order to appreciate works in the ways disposed by\ntradition requires the donning of a masculine perceptual attitude.\n\nTheories of the male gaze come in several varieties: Psychoanalytic\ntheories dominate film interpretation, (Mulvey 1989, 2019; Doane 1991;\nChanter 2008); but their presumptions and methodology are contested by\nphilosophers more attuned to cognitive science and analytic philosophy\n(Freeland 1998a; Carroll 1995; Cunliffe 2019). Versions of the male\ngaze can be found in the existentialist feminism of Simone de Beauvoir\n(Beauvoir 1949/2011); and there are empirically-minded observations\nthat confirm the dominance of male points of view in cultural\nartifacts without adopting any particular philosophical scaffolding.\nThese theories differ in their diagnosis of what generates the\n\u201cmaleness\u201d of the ideal observer for art. For\npsychoanalytic theorists, one must understand the operation of the\nunconscious over visual imagination to account for the presence of\ndesire in objects of visual art. For others, historical and cultural\nconditioning is sufficient to direct appreciation of art in ways that\nprivilege masculine points of view. Despite many significant\ntheoretical differences, analyses of the gaze converge in their\nconclusion that much of the art produced in the Euro-American\ntraditions situates the ideal appreciator in a masculine\nsubject-position. There is debate over the dominance of the male\nposition in all art, for appreciative subjects cannot be understood\nsimply as \u201cmasculine\u201d but require further attention to\nsexuality, race, and nationality (Silverman 1992; hooks 1992, 1995;\nYancy 2016). Sometimes a facile reading of the gaze tempts one to\nexaggerate the sharpness of gender distinctions into the male\nviewer and the female object of the gaze, though most\nfeminists avoid such over-simplification. Despite their differences,\ntheories of the gaze reject the idea that perception is ever merely\npassive reception. All of these approaches assume that vision\npossesses power: power to objectify\u2014to subject the object of\nvision to scrutiny and possession. (For example, seeing oneself as the\nexotic Other in orientalist paintings heightens the political aura of\nart produced in dominant western cultures (Al-Saji 2019).) Since\nsocial norms frame and amplify the operation of perception, there may\nbe inflections of gender in the very act of seeing (Tullman 2017).\nExaminations of aesthetic perception have provided theoretical tools\nof inestimable value in calling attention to the fact that looking is\nrarely a neutral operation of the visual sense. As Naomi Scheman\nstates:\n\nVision is the sense best adapted to express this dehumanization: it\nworks at a distance and need not be reciprocal, it provides a great\ndeal of easily categorized information, it enables the perceiver\naccurately to locate (pin down) the object, and it provides the gaze,\na way of making the visual object aware that she is a visual object.\nVision is political, as is visual art, whatever (else) it may be about\n(Scheman 1993: 159).\n\n\nNot only what is seen but what is rendered invisible or shadowy\ndemands additional examination, as with M.G. Davidson\u2019s analysis of\nthe way that photographs of black women subtly train the white male\ngaze and with Paul Taylor\u2019s study of the complexities of the phrase\n\u201cBlack is beautiful\u201d (Davidson 2016; Taylor\n2016). Occluding persons from nondominant cultures and social groups\nin visual production can exert powerful political force (Ortega 2019b;\nOrtega, Pitts, and Medina 2019).\n\nTheories of the gaze stress the activity of vision, its mastery and\ncontrol of the aesthetic object. These theories reject the separation\nof desire from pleasure, reinstating into the core of beauty the sort\nof erotic, covetous gaze that was eliminated from aesthetic\ndisinterestedness. While not all art invites understanding in terms of\nthe gaze, much does; perhaps nowhere is the ideology of extreme\ndisinterested contemplation more questionable than when applied to\npaintings of female nudes, which one feminist scholar argues virtually\ndefine the modern fine art of painting (Nead 1992). Aesthetic\nideologies that would remove art from its relations with the world\ndisguise its ability to inscribe and to reinforce power relations. The\nerotic in art is one of those relations, and denying its presence\ndisguises both its persuasive sway and its aesthetic force (Eaton\n2012). With visual art, those relations are manifest in vision itself:\nthe way it is depicted in a work and the way it is directed in the\nobserver outside the work. Becoming attuned to the prescribed\nviewing-position of a work of visual art brings desire and suppressed\nheteroeroticism into focus and illuminates other presumptions about\nthe ideal audience for art, such as sexual identity and race (Roelofs\n2009, 2014). Depictions of the body in art are continuous with\npornographic and erotic representations, other areas of feminist\ninvestigations (Maes and Levinson 2012; Eaton 2007, 2012, 2017, 2018;\nKania 2012; Shusterman 2021).\n\nMany of these critical investigations can be ordered into a sustained\ncritique of aesthetic practices, in particular, of what is presented\nin the name of beauty. Of all the concepts within aesthetics,\nfor feminist consideration there is none so central, so contested, so\nrejected, and so embraced as beauty. Beauty is an enormous category of\nvalue, for so many disparate things are beautiful that generalizing\nabout its nature is a formidable challenge. Beauty is among the oldest\nof philosophical value concepts, with Plato numbering among its\nformative theorists. Plato focused on beauty as an abstract form whose\nessence is bestowed on the particular items that instantiate it, and\nin keeping with this foundational model, philosophers have usually\ntreated beauty in the most general of terms. Combined with the modern\nnotion of disinterested attention, this approach to aesthetic value\nseems to aim at the highest level of universality of appreciation. Yet\nat the same time, as noted above, one of the central exemplars of\nbeauty has been the (young, pretty, pale-skinned) female body, which\nexerts erotic attraction and promises satisfaction of physical desire.\nCritiques of the gender-inflection in supposedly neutral theories, as\nwell as its racialized implications, numbered among the early feminist\nrevisions in aesthetics. These theoretical efforts merged with social\ncritiques of beauty norms that circulated in the late twentieth\ncentury. What is more, for some time, beauty was rather sidelined in\nthe art world as well (Danto 2003). As a result, beauty fell out of\nfavor, and for quite a while one could find little original work\npublished on the subject.\n\nAll that began to change around 1990, and since the turn of the last\nmillennium there has been a veritable explosion of interest in beauty\namong philosophers, artists, critics, and cultural\ntheorists\u2014feminists among them (Brand 2000, 2013; Higgins, Maira, and\nSikka 2017). While some of this work continues to consider the general\ntraits of beauty in art and nature, quite a lot of it focuses on the\nnorms of appearance of the human body, and the \u201cviolation\u201d\nof \u201cstandard\u201d norms according to race, disability, age,\nhistory, and variant sexual morphologies. Such standards govern not\nonly artistic depictions, but also the way that real people shape and\nreshape their own bodies to conform to reigning standards of\nattractiveness (Devereaux 2013; Wegenstein 2012). Feminists and\ncritical race theorists have been especially mindful of diversity and\nsuspicious of general norms and the harms that they can occasion. Yet\nat the same time feminists have recognized the pull of pleasure and\nthe importance of beauty in life as well as art. Seeking to avoid the\ndogma of universalism, Janet Wolff proposes an aesthetics of\n\u201cuncertainty\u201d that recognizes that norms of beauty are\ngrounded in communities and are thus ineluctably political, and yet\ndoes not relinquish the value of beauty (Wolff 2006).\n\nSimilar recognition of the potentials for both danger and pleasure in\nbeauty is found in investigations that seek to decenter notions of\nbeauty with reference to race, indigenous people, and subaltern\ncultures (e.g. Brand 2000, 2013, and Felski 2006). Nor is this a\ntheoretical effort alone; artists are major participants in the\nreclamation of beauty that takes as many forms as humanity offers. The\nupshot of this work is not to reinstate beauty back on its abstract\npedestal, but to retain its pleasures while being alert to its\ndangers. As Monique Roelofs observes, \u201cthe menace and promise of\nthe beautiful as a bearer of aesthetic value, a dimension of\nexperience, and a category of cultural criticism turn on the ways in\nwhich we may dislocate its relational functioning\u201d (Roelofs\n2013: 73). The functions of beauty include the seductions of\nadvertising, a pervasive social phenomenon that reinforces and\nmanipulates ideals of femininity and thus represents another important\ntarget for feminist examinations (Michna 2016; Widdows 2019). In\naddition, the growing field of somaesthetics has increasingly focused\non the body, the care of the self, and gendered ideals of beauty that\naffect men as well as women (Hyv\u00f6nen 2020), as well as the\nperformative body in dance (Banes 1998; Bresnahan, Katan-Schmid and\nHouston 2020) and competitive sports (Morgan and Edgars 2021).\n",
