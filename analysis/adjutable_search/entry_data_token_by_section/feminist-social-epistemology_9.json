Focusing on the power differentials characteristic of\nsystematic oppression, Miranda Fricker\u2019s 2007 book Epistemic\nInjustice identifies testimonial injustice as one of two important\nforms of epistemic injustice. Testimonial injustice occurs when a\nspeaker is given less credibility than deserved (suffering a\ncredibility deficit) because of an identity prejudice held by the\nhearer. So for example, a woman might be less likely to be believed\nbecause of a prejudice on the part of the hearer regarding her gender.\nFricker argues that although it is correct to view testimonial\ninjustice as an ethical wrong insofar as it is an injustice, it is\nimportant to recognize the wrong as specifically epistemic in nature in\nthat it involves being wronged specifically in one\u2019s capacity as\na knower (2007, 20). Fricker considers our role as testifiers a core\ndimension of our epistemic lives, so to suffer a credibility deficit\nimpedes one\u2019s capacity as an epistemic agent, making it both an\nethical and an epistemic wrong when one suffers a deficit due to an\nidentity prejudice. Fricker also recommends a corrective to such\ninjustice. She frames her work in terms of a virtue epistemology of a\nresponsibilist form, and posits an epistemic virtue of testimonial\njustice. The virtue of testimonial justice involves an agent\u2019s\nreflexive critical social awareness. Such an awareness allows\na hearer to account for the likely impact of the identity power\nrelation that mediates between himself and the speaker on his\nspontaneous perception, essentially correcting for the problems that\ncan result in transactions of testimonial injustice (2007, 91). In a\nsimilar vein, Nancy Daukas argues for an explicitly social form of\nvirtue epistemology that takes as its core epistemic virtue\n\u201cepistemic trustworthiness\u201d (2006, 2011). For Daukas,\nepistemic trustworthiness includes dispositions to both represent\noneself as a credible testifier and reliably judge the credibility of\nothers. In order to achieve the latter in contexts of oppression where\nthere are social prejudices and epistemic practices that contribute to\nthe maintenance of a culture of domination, one must develop an\n\u201coppositional epistemic agency\u201d that involves a\n\u201ccritical acuity\u201d through which one can recognize and\nresist \u201cthe values and theoretical commitments embedded in\nepistemic practices and products that maintain a culture of domination\nand oppression\u201d (2011, 59).\n\n\nWhile Fricker and Daukas focus on the responses of individual agents\nas correctives to testimonial injustice, others have expanded on the\nbreadth and depth of the problem. For example, Elizabeth Anderson\nargues for the need to develop large-scale structural remedies such as\nensuring broadly inclusive epistemic institutions in order to fully\ncorrect for the systemic biases that result in testimonial injustices\n(Anderson 2012). Kristie Dotson points to the difficulties of even\nidentifying such practices of silencing and distinguishes two different\nkinds of silencing practices: testimonial quieting and testimonial\nsmothering. While testimonial quieting characterizes the failure to\nrecognize the speaker as a knower and thus the failure to offer the\nspeaker appropriate uptake, Dotson describes testimonial smothering as\na coerced truncation of one\u2019s testimony. Testimonial smothering\noccurs when a speaker recognizes her audience as unwilling or unable to\ngive the appropriate uptake to her testimony, and in response, limits\nand shapes her testimony in order to \u201cinsure that the testimony\ncontains only content for which one\u2019s audience demonstrates\ntestimonial competence\u201d (2011, 244). Dotson characterizes both of\nthese silencing practices as forms of epistemic violence, and both have\ndramatic epistemic effects for the epistemic pursuits of individuals\nand communities alike.\n\n\nFricker also discusses a second and related form of epistemic\ninjustice that has generated substantial discussion: hermeneutical\ninjustice. Hermeneutical injustice, involves a \u201cstructural\nprejudice in the economy of collective hermeneutical resources\u201d\n(2007, 1). Hermeneutical injustice occurs when there exists a lack of\ncollective interpretative resources required for a group to understand\n(and express) significant aspects of their social experience. Fricker\noffers the example of the situation of women who experienced episodes\nof what we now identify as sexual harassment, prior to it being named\nand recognized as such. Without the presence of a socially recognized\nconcept of sexual harassment, women were ill-equipped to both\nunderstand and convey these significant experiences and their harms.\n\n\nMany who have found hermeneutical injustice to be a powerful concept\nfor articulating the challenges of the oppressed in gaining and\nexpressing knowledge of their experiences have at the same time\npointed out the limitations of Fricker\u2019s analysis, and have diverged\nfrom her account accordingly. For example, some have argued that her\nanalysis misrepresents hermeneutical resources as collective, failing\nto acknowledge the pluralism of interpretative communities and\npractices through which marginalized groups may have access to\nalternative interpretations of their experiences (Mason 2011; Medina\n2012). Dotson, for example, argues that a third kind of epistemic\ninjustice exists, contributory injustice, through which a dominant\ngroup refuses to employ the hermeneutical resources that marginalized\ncommunities have developed to aid in understanding their experiences\n(Dotson 2012). In this, Dotson builds on Pohlhaus\u2019s conception of\n\u201cwillful hermeneutical ignorance\u201d through which the dominant refuse to\nengage with those hermeneutical resources (of the marginalized) that\nwould in effect challenge their ability to continue on in their\n(comfortable) misinterpretation and ignorance of the experiences of\nthe marginalized (Pohlhaus 2012). Relatedly, such cases can lead to a\nkind of epistemic exploitation, where the dominant assume it is the\nresponsibility of the marginalized to perform the labor necessary to\neducate them (the dominant) in the experiences of the oppressed\n(Berenstain 2016). Further, Medina analyses the performative dimension\nof hermeneutical injustice, noting that this features demonstrates its\nvery close links with testimonial injustice. These forms of epistemic\ninjustice do not operate independently. He argues that we must examine\nthe communicative dynamics that perpetuate hermeneutical injustices,\nin order to understand how agents can exercise hermeneutical\nsensitivities and responsibilities that would help erode such\ninjustices (Medina 2012).\n\n\nDiscussions of epistemic injustice offer an excellent example of work\nfocusing on the challenges of knowing in contexts of oppression,\nanalyzing how many of the wrongs that occur within such contexts have\nboth epistemic and ethical dimensions. Framing epistemic matters in\nterms of \u201cinjustice\u201d marks a significant development in\nsocial epistemology, through which attention is drawn to the complex\nnetwork of epistemic relations between knowers. At the same time, as\nthe discussions of epistemic injustice have broadened and attention\nhas turned to the interaction between different forms of epistemic\ninjustice and the inadequacy of transactional remedies between\nindividual knowers, some have found the language of epistemic\ninjustice and justice too limiting and have reached for different\nconcepts. For example, Dotson frames many of these issues in terms of\n\u201cepistemic oppression\u201d that involves \u201cpersistent epistemic exclusion\u201d\n(Dotson 2014), and Medina develops an \u201cepistemology of resistance\u201d in\nresponse to the epistemic dimensions of oppression (Medina 2013).\n",
