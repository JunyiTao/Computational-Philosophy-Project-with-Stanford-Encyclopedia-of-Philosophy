Adopting such\npractices need not be the result of accommodation or adaptation; it\nneed not be the result of an attempt to resolve cognitive dissonance\nat an unconscious level, or of resigned habituation to oppressive\ncircumstances. Rather, the practices in question can be the explicit\nrequirements of a society or culture, and self-consciously promoted by\nwomen themselves. Uma Narayan describes a community of women in India,\nthe Sufi Pirzadi, who \u201clive in relative purdah (seclusion)\nwithin the home and are expected to veil when they are in\npublic\u201d (Narayan 2002, 420). These women acknowledge that purdah\nseverely limits their education and mobility, and has the effect of\nmaking them dependent on male members of the community. But they also\nexplicitly recognize benefits, for instance, that veiling signifies\n\u201cwomanly modesty and propriety\u201d and their \u201csuperior\nstanding vis-\u00e0-vis other Muslim women\u201d (Narayan 2002,\n420\u20131).\n\nSome theorists of autonomy (e.g., Oshana 2006) claim that severely\nconstraining external conditions are autonomy-undermining. Other\ntheorists are more circumspect, urging that women subject to\nconstraining practices should not be characterized as \u201ccompliant\ndupes of patriarchy\u201d (Narayan 2002, 420) and that women living\nunder oppressive regimes could autonomously accept their\nconditions (Christman 2004, 152; Westlund 2009, 29). Diana Meyers\nwrites, for instance, that \u201cthere are women [participating in\nthe practice of female genital cutting] who conclude that cultural\ntradition or cohesion or getting married and bearing children are more\nimportant than bodily integrity\u201d and that therefore \u201cwe\nwould need far more consensus than we presently have (or are likely to\nget)\u2026before we could conclude that women who opt for compliance\nwith female genital cutting norms never do so autonomously\u201d\n(Meyers 2000a, 479).\n\nWe see, then, that feminist philosophers have responded to the hard\ncases in different ways. The following sections provide a more\ndetailed elaboration of the theoretical positions behind these\ndifferent responses.\n",
