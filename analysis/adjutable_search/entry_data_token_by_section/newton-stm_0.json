    "main_text": "Overview of the Scholium\n1. Overview of the Scholium\n\n Today, Newton is best known as a physicist whose greatest single\ncontribution was the formulation of classical mechanics and\ngravitational theory as set out in his Philosophae Naturalis\nPrincipia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural\nPhilosophy), first published in 1687, and now usually referred to\nsimply as \u201cNewton's Principia\u201d. Newton's views on\nspace, time, and motion not only provided the kinematical basis for\nthis monumental work and thus for the whole of classical physics up\nuntil the early twentieth century, but also played an integral role in\nNewton's general system of philosophy and theology (largely developed\nprior to the Principia). Because Newton never drafted a\ntreatise on, or even a digest of, this general system, his stature as\none of the great philosophers of the seventeenth century, indeed, of\nall time, is no longer widely appreciated.  \n\n A \u201cScholium\u201d at the beginning of the Principia,\ninserted between the \u201cDefinitions\u201d and the \u201cLaws of\nMotion\u201d, lays out Newton's views on time, space, place, and\nmotion. He begins by saying that, since in common life these\nquantities are conceived of in terms of their relations to sensible bodies, it is\nincumbent to distinguish between, on the one hand, the relative,\napparent, common conception of them, and, on the other, the absolute,\ntrue, mathematical quantities themselves. To paraphrase: \n\n Absolute, true, and mathematical time, from its\nown nature, passes equably without relation to anything external, and\nthus without reference to any change or way of measuring of time\n(e.g., the hour, day, month, or year).\n Absolute, true, and mathematical space remains\nsimilar and immovable without relation to anything external. (The\nspecific meaning of this will become clearer below from the way it\ncontrasts with Descartes' concept of space.) Relative spaces are\nmeasures of absolute space defined with reference to some system of\nbodies or another, and thus a relative space may, and likely will, be\nin motion.\n The place of a body is the space which it\noccupies, and may be absolute or relative according to whether the\nspace is absolute or relative.\nAbsolute motion is the translation of a body from\none absolute place to another; relative motion the translation from\none relative place to another.\n\n\n Newton devotes the bulk of the Scholium to arguing that the\ndistinction between the true quantities and their relative measures is\nnecessary and justified. \n\n It is evident from these characterizations that, according to Newton:\n\n\nspace is something distinct from body and exists independently of\nthe existence of bodies,\nthere is a fact of the matter whether a given body moves and what\nits true quantity of motion is, and\nthe true motion of a body does not consist of, or cannot be\ndefined in terms of, its motion relative to other bodies.\n\n\n The first of these theses was a point of major contention in\n17th-century natural philosophy and one assailed by Newton's critics\nsuch as Leibniz, Huygens, and Berkeley. The second was not in\ngeneral dispute. Descartes, Leibniz, and Berkeley all believed that,\nto put it in somewhat scholastic terms, the predicate \u2018x is\nin true motion\u2019 is a complete predicate in the sense that it holds or\nfails to hold for any given body. (Huygens, at least in his\npost-Principia views, constitutes a special case.) Thus, for\nthose who denied the first thesis, it was necessary to secure a\ndefinition, or an analysis, of what it means for a body be in true\nmotion (and what determines the quantity of that motion), so as to be\nas adequate to the facts as Newton's characterization of true\nmotion. The figures mentioned above all deemed that motion relative to\nother bodies is a necessary condition for true motion,\nalthough not, by itself, a sufficient condition.  \n\n Over the course of years, the consensus in the 17th and early 18th\nCenturies on thesis (2) was lost sight of, and it became common to\ncharacterize Newton's opponents as  denying that there is a\nfact of the matter as to whether a body is in true motion and\nmaintaining instead that all motion is merely relative\nmotion. Thus, modern readers expect that Newton's Scholium on\nspace, time, and motion should be read as arguing not only thesis (1)\nabove, but also thesis (2), that all motion is not merely relative\nmotion, but that some motions are true and absolute. Newton's\narguments concerning motion, however, are designed to show, not that\ntrue motion is distinct from merely relative motion (which is granted\nby all), but rather that the only feasible analysis of true motion\nrequires reference to absolute places, and thus the existence of\nabsolute space.  \n\n In particular it has been assumed that Newton's so-called \u201crotating\nbucket experiment\u201d, together with the later example of a pair of\nglobes connected by a chord and revolving about their center of\ngravity, is supposed to argue, or provide evidence for, the existence\nof true, or absolute, motion. Not only is this false, but the two\ncases have distinct purposes in the framework of the Scholium. The\nrotating bucket experiment is the last of five arguments from the\n\u201cproperties, causes, and effects of motion\u201d designed to show\ncumulatively that an adequate analysis of true motion must involve\nreference to absolute space. In contrast, the example of the revolving\nglobes is intended to illustrate how it is that, despite the fact that\nabsolute space is invisible to the senses, it is nonetheless possible\nto infer the quantity of absolute motion of individual bodies in\nvarious cases.  \n",
