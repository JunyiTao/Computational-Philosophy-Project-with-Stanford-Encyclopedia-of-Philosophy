    "main_text": "Formal Approaches to Social Epistemology || Formal Epistemology in the Social Realm\n4.1 Formal Epistemology in the Social Realm\n\nAs mentioned, formal epistemology has mostly focused on issues related\nto individual epistemology. This said, there is a significant portion\nof this literature addressing questions including 1) how should a\ngroup aggregate their judgements? 2) how should a group aggregate\ntheir (more fine-grained) beliefs? 3) how should Bayesians update on\nthe testimony of others? and 4) what sorts of aggregation methods\ncreate rational or effective groups?\n\nLet\u2019s start with judgement aggregation. Judgement aggregation\nassumes that individuals in a group hold binary opinions or attitudes\non some matters. These could be factual like \u201cdefendant X is\ninnocent\u201d or actionable like \u201cwe should get Chinese food\ntonight.\u201d The question is then how the group should aggregate\nthese judgements to facilitate group action. Or: how can individually\nrational judgements be combined into a rationally judging group?\n\nA sticky problem that emerges is the \u201cdoctrinal paradox,\u201d\noriginally formulated by Kornhauser and Sager (1986) in the context of\nlegal judgments. Suppose that a court consisting of three judges must\nrender a judgment. The group judgment is to be based on each of three\nrelated propositions, where the first two propositions are premises\nand the third the conclusion. For example:\n\nThe defendant was legally obliged not to do a certain action.\nThe defendant did do that action.\nThe defendant is liable for breach of contract.\n\n\nLegal doctrine entails that obligation and action are jointly\nnecessary and sufficient for liability. That is, conclusion (3) is\ntrue if and only if the two preceding premises are each true. Suppose,\nhowever, as shown in the table below, that the three judges form the\nindicated beliefs, vote accordingly, and the judgment-aggregation\nfunction delivers a conclusion guided by majority rule.\n\n\n\n \nObligation?\nAction?\nLiable? \n\nJudge 1\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue \n\nJudge 2\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse \n\nJudge 3\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse \n\nGroup\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse  \n\n\nIn this example, each of the three judges has a logically\nself-consistent set of beliefs. Moreover, a majority aggregation\nfunction seems eminently reasonable. Nonetheless, the upshot is that\nthe court\u2019s judgments are jointly inconsistent.\n\nThis kind of problem arises easily when a judgment is made by multiple\nmembers of a collective entity. This led a number of authors, starting\nwith List and Pettit (2002), to prove impossibility theorems in which\nreasonable-looking combinations of constraints were nonetheless shown\nto be jointly unsatisfiable in judgment aggregation. Further\ngeneralizations are due to Pauly and van Hees 2006, Dietrich 2006, and\nMongin 2008. These results reflect Arrow\u2019s famous impossibility\ntheorem for preference aggregation (Arrow 1951/1963).\n\nIn light of these results, various \u201cescape routes\u201d have\nbeen proposed. List and Pettit (2011) offer ways to relax requirements\nso that majority voting, for example, satisfies collective\nrationality. Briggs et al. (2014) argue that it may be too strong to\nrequire that entities always have logically consistent beliefs.\nFollowing Joyce (1998), they introduce a weaker notion of coherence of\nbeliefs. They show that the majority voting aggregation of logically\nconsistent beliefs will always be coherent, and the aggregation of\ncoherent beliefs will typically be coherent as well.\n\nSome apply the theory of judgment aggregation to the increasingly\ncommon problem of how collaborating scientific authors should decide\nwhat statements to endorse. Solomon (2006), for instance, argues that\nvoting might help scientists avoid \u201cgroupthink\u201d arising\nfrom group deliberation. While Wray (2014) defends deliberation as\ncrucial to the production of group consensus, Bright et al. (2018)\npoint out that consensus is not always necessary (or possible) in\nscientific reporting. In such cases, they argue, majority voting is a\ngood way to decide what statements a report will endorse, even if\nthere is disagreement in the group.\n\nRather than focusing on the aggregation of judgements, we might,\ninstead, consider aggregating degrees of belief, or\n\u201ccredences.\u201d These are numbers between 0 and 1\nrepresenting an agent\u2019s degree of certainty in a statement. (For\ninstance, if I think there is a 90% chance it is raining, my credence\nthat it is raining is .9.) This representation changes the question of\njudgement aggregation to something like this: if a group of people\nhold different individual credences, what should the group credence\nbe?\n\nThis ends up being very closely related to the question of how an\nindividual ought to update their credences upon learning the credences\nof others. If a rational group ought to adopt some aggregated belief,\nthen it might also make sense for an individual in the group to adopt\nthe same belief as a result of learning about the credences of their\npeers. In other words, the problems of belief aggregation, peer\ndisagreement, and testimony are entangled in this literature. (Though\nsee Easwaran et al. (2016) for a discussion of distinctions between\nthese issues.) We\u2019ll focus here on belief aggregation.\n\nIn principle, there are many ways that one can go about aggregating\ncredences or pooling opinions (Genest and Zidek 1986). A simple option\nis to combine opinions by linear pooling\u2014taking a weighted\naverage of credences. This averaging could respect all credences\nequally, or put extra weights on the opinions of, say, recognized\nexperts. This option has some nice properties, such as preserving\nunanimous agreement, and allowing groups to aggregate over different\ntopics independently (DeGroot 1974; Lehrer and Wagner 1981). Despite\nsome issues which will be described shortly, it is defended by many in\nformal epistemology as the best way to combine credences (Moss 2011,\nPettigrew 2019b).\n\nIn thinking about ideal knowledge creation though, we might ask how a\nBayesian (i.e., an individual who rationally holds to ideals\nof credence updating) should update credences in light of peer\ndisagreement or how a group of Bayesians should aggregate beliefs. A\nBayesian will not simply average across beliefs, except under\nparticular assumptions or in special cases (Genest and Zidek 1986;\nBradley 2007; Steele 2012; Russell et al. 2015). And a group that\nengages in linear averaging of this sort can typically be Dutch\nbooked, meaning they will accept a series of bets guaranteed to lose\nthem money.\n\nA fully-fledged Bayesian approach to aggregation demands that final\ncredences be derived by Bayesian updating in light of the opinions\nheld by each group member (Keeney and Raiffa 1993). Notice, this is\nalso what a Bayesian individual should do to update on the credences\nof others. To do this properly, though, is very complicated. It\nrequires prior probabilities about what obtains in the world, as well\nas probabilities about how likely each group member is to develop\ntheir credences in light of what might obtain in world. This will not\nbe practical in real cases.\n\nInstead, many approaches consider features that are desirable for\nrational aggregation, and then ask which simpler aggregation rules\nsatisfy them. For instance, one thing a rational aggregation method\nshould do (to prevent Dutch booking) is yield the same credence\nregardless of whether information is obtained before or after\naggregating. For instance, if we all have credences about the rain,\nand someone comes in wearing shorts, it should not matter to the final\ngroup output whether 1) they entered and we all updated our credences\n(in a Bayesian way) and then aggregated them, or 2) we aggregated our\ncredences, they entered, and we updated the aggregated credence (in a\nBayesian way). Geometric methods, which take the geometric average of\nprobabilities over worlds, yield this desirable property (and\nother desirable properties) in many cases (Genest 1984; Dietrich and\nList 2016, Russell et al. 2015, Baccelli & Stewart 2023). These\nmethods proceed by multiplying (weighted) credences over worlds that\nmight obtain and then renormalizing them to sum to 1.\n\nOne thing that geometric averaging does not do, though, is allow for\ncredences over different propositions to be aggregated completely\nindependently from each other. (This is something often treated as a\ndesideratum for judgment aggregation.) For instance, our beliefs about\nthe probabilities of hail might influence how we will aggregate our\nbeliefs over the probabilities of rain. Instead, a more holistic\napproach to aggregation is required. This is an important lesson for\napproaches to social epistemology which focus on individual topics of\ninterest in addressing peer disagreement and testimony (Russell et al.\n2015).\n\nAnother thing that some take to be strange about geometric averaging\nis that it sometimes will aggregate identical credences to a different\ngroup credence. For instance, we might all have credence .7 that it is\nraining, but our group credence might be .9. Easwaran et al. (2016)\nargue, though, that this often makes sense when updating on the\ncredences of others\u2014their confidence should make us\nmore confident (see also Christensen 2009). In light of critiques of\nboth geometric and linear averaging, Kinney (2022) argues that\nattention should be paid to the underlying models of the world that\nindividuals are working from when combining credences. He advocates\nfor an aggregation method using \u201cmodel stacking\u201d a la Le\nand Clarke (2017). A general take-away is that although the question\nof rational credence aggregation might initially sound trivial, this\nis very far from the reality. There are deep and enduring questions\nabout what a rational group consists in.\n\nThe question of whether aggregated credences can be more extreme than\nindividual ones echoes much earlier work bearing on the question: are\ngroups smart? In 1785, the Marquis de Condorcet wrote an essay proving\nthe following. Suppose a group of individuals form independent beliefs\nabout a topic and they are each more than 50% likely to reach a\ncorrect judgement. If they take a majority vote, the group is more\nlikely to vote correctly the larger it gets (in the limit this\nlikelihood approaches 1). This result, now known as the\n\u201cCondorcet Jury Theorem,\u201d underlies what is sometimes\ncalled the \u201cwisdom of the crowds\u201d: in the right conditions\ncombining the knowledge of many can be very effective. Many have drawn\non this result to think about the rationality of group reasoning and\ndecision making.\n\nIn many cases, though, real groups are prone to epistemic problems\nwhen it comes to combining beliefs. Consider the phenomenon of\ninformation cascades, first identified by Bikhchandani et al. (1992).\nTake a group of agents who almost all have private information that\nNissan stock is better than GM stock. The first agent buys GM stock\nbased on their (minority) private information. The second agent has\ninformation that Nissan is better, but on the basis of this observed\naction updates their belief to think GM is likely better. They also\nbuy GM stock. The third agent now sees that two peers purchased GM and\nlikewise updates their beliefs to prefer GM stock. This sets off a\ncascade of GM buying among observers who, without social information,\nwould have bought Nissan. The problem here is a lack of independence\nin the \u201cvote\u201d\u2014each individual is influenced by the\nbeliefs and actions of the previous individuals in a way that obscures\nthe presence of private information. In updating on the credences of\nothers, we thus may need to be careful to take into account that they\nmight already have updated on the credences of others.\n",
