    "main_text": "Commentary on Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics || History of the Field\n3.1 History of the Field\n\nKant\u2019s conception of mathematics was debated by his\ncontemporaries; influenced and provoked Frege, Russell and Husserl;\nand provided inspiration for Brouwerian Intuitionism. His conception\nof mathematics was rejuvenated as worthy of close historical study by\nGottfried Martin\u2019s 1938 monograph Arithmetik und\nKombinatoric bei Kant (Martin 1985). Despite the very different\npositions that contemporary commentators develop as to how best to\nunderstand Kant\u2019s thought, they are broadly united in opposing a\nlong-standard story (perhaps originally promoted by Bertrand Russell\nin his Principles of Mathematics and by Rudolph Carnap in his\nPhilosophical Foundations of Physics) according to which the\ndevelopment of modern logic in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries, and the\nformalization of mathematics renders Kant\u2019s intuition-based\ntheory of mathematics and related philosophical commitments obsolete\nor irrelevant. Contemporary commentators seek to reconstruct\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics from the vantage of\nKant\u2019s own historical context and also to identify the elements\nof Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics that are of eternal\nphilosophical interest (Parsons 2014).\n\nEnglish language scholarship in the analytic tradition on\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics (the focus of this\narticle) has been influenced most strongly by an enduring debate\nbetween Jaakko Hintikka and Charles Parsons over Kant\u2019s view of\nthe role of intuition in mathematics, leading to what have\ncome to be known as the \u201clogical\u201d and\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d interpretations; by Michael\nFriedman\u2019s seminal book, Kant and the Exact Sciences\n(Friedman 1992), as well as his now classic articles\n\u201cKant\u2019s Theory of Geometry\u201d and \u201cGeometry,\nConstruction and Intuition in Kant and his Successors\u201d (Friedman\n1985, 2000); and by the papers collected in Carl Posy\u2019s volume\nKant\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics: Modern\nEssays (which includes contributions by Hintikka, Parsons\nand Friedman, as well as by Stephen Barker, Gordon Brittan, William\nHarper, Philip Kitcher, Arthur Melnick, Carl Posy, Manley Thompson,\nand J.Michael Young, all of which were published more than twenty five\nyears ago (Posy 1992).)\n",
