The Moral Justification for One-off Acts of Torture in Emergencies\n\nIn this section one-off, non-institutionalised acts of torture\nperformed by state actors in emergency situations are considered. The\nargument is that there are, or could well be, one-off acts of torture\nin extreme emergencies that are, all things considered, morally\njustifiable. Accordingly, the assumption is that the routine\nuse of torture is not morally justified; so if it turned out that the\nroutine use of torture was necessary to, say, win the war on\nterrorism, then some of what is said here would not be to the point.\nHowever, liberal democratic governments and security agencies have not\neven begun to exhaust the political strategies, and the\nmilitary/police tactics short of the routine use of torture, available\nto them to combat terrorism.\n\nThe most obvious version of the argument in favour of one-off acts of\ntorture in extreme emergencies is consequentialist in form. For\nexample, Bagaric and Clarke (2007: 29) offer a version of the ticking\nbomb scenario in the context of their hedonistic act utilitarian\ntheoretical perspective. A standard objection to this kind of appeal\nto consequentialism is that it licenses far too much: torture of a few\ninnocent victims may well be justified, on this account, if it\nprovides intense pleasure for a much larger number of sadists. As it\nhappens, Bagaric and Clarke insist that they want to restrict the\npractice of torture; only the guilty are to be subjected to torture\nand only for the purpose of extracting information. However it is far\nfrom clear how this desired restriction can be reconciled with\nconsequentialism in any of its various permutations, let alone the\nrelatively permissive version favoured by Bagaric and Clarke. Why, for\nexample, should torture be restricted to the guilty, if torturing a\nsmall number of innocent persons would enable the lives of many other\ninnocents to be saved (as presumably it might). Again, why should\nunder-resourced Indian police not torture \u2013 as they often do in\nreality \u2013 a repeat offender responsible for a very large number of\nproperty crimes, if this proves to be the only available efficient and\neffective form of retrieving the stolen property in question and,\nthereby, securing the conviction of this offender, reducing property\ncrime and making a large number of property owners happy? The\nessential problem confronted by consequentialists participating in the\ntorture debate is that their theoretically admissible moral barriers\nto torture are relatively flimsy; too flimsy, it seems, to accommodate\nthe strong moral intuitions in play.\n\nFaced with the slippery slope, as they see it, of one-off acts of\ntorture in extreme emergencies transmogrifying into institutionalised\ntorture, and/or simply appalled by the inherent evil of the practice\nof torture, many theorists \u2013 Arrigo (2004), Davis (2005), Luban\n(2005), Juratowitch (2008), Mayerfield (2008), Brecher (2008),\nMatthews (2008), and Shue (2016) \u2013 have opted for the opposite\nextreme and argued that torture can never be morally justified. Most\nof these theorists avoid the problems besetting consequentialists such\nas Bagaric and Clarke, and they are on strong ground when providing\ncounter-arguments to consequentialist perspectives and/or views that\nseek to justify torturing the innocent. (But see Arrigo 2004.)\nHowever, their moral absolutism is not without its own problems:\nspecifically, in relation to torturing the guilty few for the purpose\nof saving the innocent many. (See Walzer 1973, Miller 2005; Kershnar\n2006 and Steinhoff 2013.)\n\nBefore turning in detail to the arguments on this issue, let us\nconsider some putative examples of the justified use of torture. The\nfirst is a policing example, the second a terrorist example. Arguably,\nboth examples are realistic, albeit the terrorist ticking bomb\nscenario is often claimed by moral absolutists to be utterly fanciful.\nCertainly, the policing example is realistic; indeed, it was provided\nby a former police officer from his own experience. Moreover, it is\nwidely reported in the media that Al Qaeda, for example, has in the\npast sought to acquire a nuclear device to detonate in a western city\nand the 9/11 attacks and bombings in Bali, London, Madrid and Mumbai\nshould leave no doubt whatsoever that Al Qaeda would use such a device\nif they could get their hands on one. So is it entirely fanciful that\nthere could be such an attack and that an Al Qaeda operative known (on\nthe basis of intercepted communications) to be a member of the cell\ninvolved in the planned attack might not be arrested, interrogated and\ntortured(?) prior to the detonation? At any rate, these are the two\nmost popular kinds of example discussed in the literature. These cases\ninclude the real-life Daschner case involving the threat to torture a\nkidnapper by German police in 2002 which resulted in the kidnapper\ndisclosing the location of a kidnapped child (Miller 2005).\n",
