    "main_text": "Philosophical foundations for analogical reasoning || Inductive justification\n4.2 Inductive justification\n\nSome philosophers have attempted to portray, and justify, analogical\nreasoning in terms of some well-understood inductive argument pattern.\nThere have been three moderately popular versions of this strategy.\nThe first treats analogical reasoning as generalization from a single\ncase. The second treats it as a kind of sampling argument. The third\nrecognizes the argument from analogy as a distinctive form, but treats\npast successes as evidence for future success.\n4.2.1 Single-case induction\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider Aristotle\u2019s argument from example or\nparadeigma\n (\u00a73.2),\n but this time regard the generalization as justified via induction\nfrom a single case (the source domain). Can such a simple analysis of\nanalogical arguments succeed? In general: no.\n\nA single instance can sometimes lead to a justified generalization.\nCartwright (1992) argues that we can sometimes generalize from a\nsingle careful experiment, \u201cwhere we have sufficient control of\nthe materials and our knowledge of the requisite background\nassumptions is secure\u201d (51). Cartwright thinks that we can do\nthis, for example, in experiments with compounds that have stable\n\u201cAristotelian natures.\u201d In a similar spirit, Quine (1969)\nmaintains that we can have instantial confirmation when dealing with\nnatural kinds.\n\nEven if we accept that there are such cases, the objection to\nunderstanding all analogical arguments as single-case induction is\nobvious: the view is simply too restrictive. Most analogical arguments\nwill not meet the requisite conditions. We may not know that we are\ndealing with a natural kind or Aristotelian nature when we make the\nanalogical argument. We may not know which properties are essential.\nAn insistence on the \u2018single-case induction\u2019 analysis of\nanalogical reasoning is likely to lead to skepticism (Agassi 1964,\n1988).\n\nInterpreting the argument from analogy as single-case induction is\nalso counter-productive in another way. The simplistic analysis does\nnothing to advance the search for criteria that help us to distinguish\nbetween relevant and irrelevant similarities, and hence between good\nand bad analogical arguments.\n4.2.2 Sampling arguments\n\nOn the sampling conception of analogical arguments, acknowledged\nsimilarities between two domains are treated as statistically relevant\nevidence for further similarities. The simplest version of the\nsampling argument is due to Mill (1843/1930). An argument from\nanalogy, he writes, is \u201ca competition between the known points\nof agreement and the known points of difference.\u201d Agreement of\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in 9 out of 10 properties implies a probability of 0.9\nthat \\(B\\) will possess any other property of \\(A\\): \u201cwe can\nreasonably expect resemblance in the same proportion\u201d (367). His\nonly restriction has to do with sample size: we must be relatively\nknowledgeable about both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Mill saw no difficulty in\nusing analogical reasoning to infer characteristics of newly\ndiscovered species of plants or animals, given our extensive knowledge\nof botany and zoology. But if the extent of unascertained properties\nof \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is large, similarity in a small sample would not be\na reliable guide; hence, Mill\u2019s dismissal of Reid\u2019s\nargument about life on other planets\n (Example 2).\n\nThe sampling argument is presented in more explicit mathematical form\nby Harrod (1956). The key idea is that the known properties of \\(S\\)\n(the source domain) may be considered a random sample of all\n\\(S\\)\u2019s properties\u2014random, that is, with respect to the\nattribute of also belonging to \\(T\\) (the target domain). If the\nmajority of known properties that belong to \\(S\\) also belong to\n\\(T\\), then we should expect most other properties of \\(S\\) to belong\nto \\(T\\), for it is unlikely that we would have come to know just the\ncommon properties. In effect, Harrod proposes a binomial distribution,\nmodeling \u2018random selection\u2019 of properties on random\nselection of balls from an urn.\n\nThere are grave difficulties with Harrod\u2019s and Mill\u2019s\nanalyses. One obvious difficulty is the counting\nproblem: the \u2018population\u2019 of properties is poorly\ndefined. How are we to count similarities and differences? The ratio\nof shared to total known properties varies dramatically according to\nhow we do this. A second serious difficulty is the problem of\nbias: we cannot justify the assumption that the sample of known\nfeatures is random. In the case of the urn, the selection process is\narranged so that the result of each choice is not influenced by the\nagent\u2019s intentions or purposes, or by prior choices. By\ncontrast, the presentation of an analogical argument is always\npartisan. Bias enters into the initial representation of similarities\nand differences: an advocate of the argument will highlight\nsimilarities, while a critic will play up differences. The paradigm of\nrepeated selection from an urn seems totally inappropriate. Additional\nvariations of the sampling approach have been developed (e.g., Russell\n1988), but ultimately these versions also fail to solve either the\ncounting problem or the problem of bias.\n4.2.3 Argument from past success\n\nSection\n 3.6\n discussed Steiner\u2019s view that appeal to\n\u2018Pythagorean\u2019 analogies in physics \u201cevokes, or\nshould evoke, puzzlement\u201d (1989: 454). Liston (2000) offers a\npossible response: physicists are entitled to use Pythagorean\nanalogies on the basis of induction from their past success:\n\n\n[The scientist] can admit that no one knows how [Pythagorean]\nreasoning works and argue that the very fact that similar strategies\nhave worked well in the past is already reason enough to continue\npursuing them hoping for success in the present instance. (200)\n\n\nSetting aside familiar worries about arguments from success, the real\nproblem here is to determine what counts as a similar strategy. In\nessence, that amounts to isolating the features of successful\nPythagorean analogies. As we have seen (\u00a72.4), nobody has yet\nprovided a satisfactory scheme that characterizes successful\nanalogical arguments, let alone successful Pythagorean analogical\narguments.\n",
