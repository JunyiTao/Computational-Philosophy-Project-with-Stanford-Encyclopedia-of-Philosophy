    "main_text": "Luther, Feuerbach, and Marxism\n4. Luther, Feuerbach, and Marxism\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Luther also plays a prominent role in the\nthought of the key post-Hegelian thinker Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804\u20131872), and to a lesser degree in that of Karl Marx\n(1818\u20131883) and Friedrich Engels (1820\u20131895), as well as\nin later thinkers in the twentieth century Marxist tradition such as\nErnst Bloch (1885\u20131977), and Herbert Marcuse\n (1898\u20131979).[36]\n\nFeuerbach\u2019s primary engagement with Luther comes in the second\nedition of his The Essence of Christianity (1843), and in\nThe Essence of Faith According to Luther (1844). Among his\nmotivations was Feuerbach\u2019s desire in the face of Protestant\ncritics to establish that the view of religion proposed in the first\nedition of The Essence of Christianity applied not only to\nthe Catholic faith (which such critics were happy to concede), but\nalso to Protestantism\u2014and of course there could be no better way\nfor Feuerbach to establish this than to demonstrate that Luther\nhimself could be encompassed within Feuerbach\u2019s analysis, which\nis what he therefore proposed in these works (see Glasse 1972 and Erdozain 2016: 223\u201345 for\nfurther discussion). Put briefly, Feuerbach\u2019s central thesis was\nthat religious beliefs are nothing more than the expressions of human\ndesires, and God is a being on whom our aspirations for ourselves are\nprojected, so that in worshipping God we are worshipping ourselves. As\nFeuerbach allows at the outset of The Essence of Faith, this\nmay seem not to apply to Luther\u2019s conception, insofar as Luther\ninsists on the fundamental discontinuity between God and human beings,\nplacing all value in the former and none in the latter. On the\nsurface, therefore, \n\n\nLuther\u2019s doctrine is divine but inhuman, indeed barbaric\u2014a\nhymn to God, but a lampoon on man. (Feuerbach 1844 [1967: 41]) \n\n\nIn response, however, Feuerbach argues that is a superficial reading,\nas the role of God is to restore to us what we have lost: \u201cMan\nin himself is and can do nothing, but in God (that is through faith)\nhe is and can do everything\u201d (1844 [1967: 46]). This can be\nseen, Feuerbach argues, in the way that Luther (in his opposition to\nCatholicism) emphasises the way in which he takes Christ\u2019s\nsuffering to be for us, so that what appeared to be a\ndivergence becomes a radical convergence. Feuerbach\u2019s\nappropriation of Luther (which of course remains controversial) is\ntherefore summarized when he writes: \n\n\n\u201cIf God sat in heaven for Himself alone\u201d, says Luther,\n\u201clike a block, He would not be God\u201d \n\n\nfrom which Feuerbach takes Luther to be agreeing with him, that\n\u201cGod is a word the sole meaning of which is\n\u2018man\u2019\u201d (1844 [1967: 50]), and thus to be\nforeshadowing Feuerbach\u2019s own anthropological turn.\n\nTurning now to Marx, Engels and others in the broadly Marxist\ntradition, their central concern was a focus on Luther\u2019s\nhistorical impact as a revolutionary and social reformer, which seemed\nto be compromised by Luther\u2019s role in the Peasants\u2019\nRevolt (see sections 1 and 5 of the entry on \n Luther). In his study of the Revolt, Engels in particular drew\nparallels with the situation leading up to the German revolutions of\n1848\u201349, casting Luther as a \u201cmiddle-class\u201d reformer\nunable to sustain the radicalism he had unleashed, which Engels (and\nlater Bloch) took to be better represented in \u201cplebeian\nrevolutionary\u201d Thomas M\u00fcntzer (c. 1489\u20131525), who\nLuther had declared to be an instrument of Satan, and who was tortured\nand executed after the battle of Frankenhausen in 1525. A similar\nsuspicion of Luther can also be found in Marcuse, in an essay from\n1936 written after Marcuse\u2019s exile from Germany to the United\nStates, and so this time against the background of the growing\nauthoritarianism of Nazism (which itself often glorified Luther).\nWithout explicitly making the connection, in this context Marcuse\naccuses Luther of relegating Christian freedom to the inner\n sphere,[37]\n leaving the outer world of politics and society as a realm of\nunfreedom to which the Christian must submit, in deference to worldly\nauthorities which Luther argued could not be challenged\u2014a\npolitical quietism which in Marcuse\u2019s context was of course\nparticularly troubling, and which after the war became a source for\nmuch criticism (and self-criticism) directed towards the Lutheran\nChurch.\n",
