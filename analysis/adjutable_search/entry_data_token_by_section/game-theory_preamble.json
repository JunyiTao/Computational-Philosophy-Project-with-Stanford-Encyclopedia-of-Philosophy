    "main_text": "\n\nGame theory is the study of the ways in which interacting\nchoices of economic agents produce outcomes\nwith respect to the preferences (or utilities) of\nthose agents, where the outcomes in question might have been intended\nby none of the agents. The meaning of this statement will not be clear\nto the non-expert until each of the italicized words and phrases has\nbeen explained and featured in some examples. Doing this will be the\nmain business of this article. First, however, we provide some\nhistorical and philosophical context in order to motivate the reader\nfor the technical work ahead. \n",
