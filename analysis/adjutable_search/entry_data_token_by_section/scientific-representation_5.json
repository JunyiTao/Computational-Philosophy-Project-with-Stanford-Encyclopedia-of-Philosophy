    "main_text": "The Structuralist Conception\n4. The Structuralist Conception\n\nThe structuralist conception of model-representation originated in the\nso-called semantic view of theories that came to prominence in the\nsecond half of the 20th century (see the SEP entry on the\n structure of scientific theories\n for further details). The semantic view was originally proposed as an\naccount of theory structure rather than scientific representation. The\ndriving idea behind the position is that scientific theories are best\nthought of as collections of models. This invites the questions: what\nare these models, and how do they represent their target systems? Most\ndefenders of the semantic view of theories (with the notable exception\nof Giere, whose views on scientific representation were discussed in\nthe previous section) take models to be structures, which represent\ntheir target systems in virtue of there being some kind of\nmorphism (isomorphism, partial isomorphism, homomorphism,\n\u2026) between the two.\n\nThis conception has two prima facie advantages. The first\nadvantage is that it offers a straightforward answer to the ER-Problem\n(or SR-problem if the focus is on scientific representation), and one\nthat accounts for surrogative reasoning: the mappings between the\nmodel and the target allow scientists to convert truths found in the\nmodel into claims about the target system. The second advantage\nconcerns the applicability of mathematics. There is a time-honoured\nposition in the philosophy of mathematics which sees mathematics as\nthe study of structures; see, for instance Resnik (1997) and Shapiro\n(2000). It is a natural move for the scientific structuralist to adopt\nthis point of view, which then provides a neat explanation of how\nmathematics is used in scientific modelling.\n",
