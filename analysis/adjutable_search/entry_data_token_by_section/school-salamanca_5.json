    "main_text": "Natural Law, Political Theory and the Rise of International Law || Political Theory\n5.2 Political Theory\n\nThe central topics in the political theory of authors from the School\nof Salamanca are the aim of political community, the legitimacy of its\npower and the relationship between the commonwealth and its ruler.\n\nIn his lecture On Civil Power (De potestate civili),\nVitoria holds that every power, public or private, comes from God and\ncannot be abolished by human beings, not even if they are in full\nconsensus. Vitoria\u2019s ideas about society depended partly on his\nAristotelian belief that human beings are social by nature, needing\nothers to survive and achieve a good life. Thus, a natural good,\nsurvival, not moral goodness, was its original purpose. Nature,\nfollowing God\u2019s purpose, had implanted in early peoples the urge\nto establish households, cities and regimes. Society eventually came\nto promote virtues, especially justice and amity, which supported the\ncommon good. He followed in a certain sense an Aristotelian line,\nusing the theory of the four causes for his analysis, first of public,\nthen of private power, and starting with the final cause, which was\nregarded in the Aristotelian and Thomist tradition as the necessary\ncause. According to Vitoria, \n\n\nthe origin of human cities and commonwealths was not a human invention\n\u2026 but a device implanted by nature in man for his own survival\n\n\n\nand for the sake of this it also needs an \u201cordering force\u201d\n(ibid., qu. 1, art. 2, p. 9). The efficient cause of public power is\nGod, and its material cause is the commonwealth itself. Royal power is\nnot from the commonwealth, even if the king is elected, but from God\nhimself (ibid., qu. 1 art. 5). Non-Christians have legitimate rulers,\nand a legitimately constituted power cannot be abolished by the\nconsent of the people (ibid., qu.1. art 6\u20137).\n\nAll peoples created regimes: since a multitude could not govern itself\nwell, power was entrusted to a group or individual acting for the\ncommon good. The best regime, in Vitoria\u2019s opinion, was rule by\none person, who was both above the community and within it.\nIndividuals might even sacrifice their lives in defense of the common\ngood. Society\u2019s natural purpose, the preservation of temporal\nlife of its members, was not in contradiction of the Church\u2019s\nend: the salvation of souls. In a Christian commonwealth, salvation\nwas the primary purpose, with human felicity as the secondary end. The\ncommonwealth transferred its power to the ruler, but his power\nultimately derived from God; and after its transfer of power to the\nruler, the commonwealth ceased to be able to legislate. Since the\nruler was within the commonwealth, he was bound by its laws. Vitoria\nstates that monarchy is the best form of government, but insists that\na commonwealth may be punished for the sins of its king, if he, for\nexample, wages an unjust war against another prince (ibid., qu. 1 art.\n8\u20139). This commonplace among the theorists of the ius\ngentium was important for some of the justifications of slavery\nand the slave trade, because captives in a just war traditionally\nbecame slaves and because the punishment of a commonwealth decided the\nfate of all its members, regardless of their individual guilt or\ninnocence. \n\nOnce different temporal regimes were created, each ruler was situated\nwithin a commonwealth. The ruler of France could not legislate for\nSpain. A ruler with multiple realms, like Emperor Charles V, had to\npromulgate laws in each region. Within a realm, custom was supposed to\nreinforce law or to be enforced itself. A ruler was best advised to\nsupport good customs. Vitoria faced the possibility that some laws\nmight be obeyed only by a few citizens, in which case they could be\nrevoked by the ruler. Revoking laws arbitrarily, however, might be\nsinful. Even a tyrant\u2019s laws had to be obeyed if they served the\ncommon good. Vitoria claimed that legislators are bound by civil laws\n(ibid., qu. 3 art. 4), but that the laws of tyrant are valid (ibid.,\nqu. 3 art. 6), a view which conflicts with positions later held by\nJesuits. The community, according to Vitoria, retained the right to\ndefend itself against a tyrant threatening its survival, but it could\nnot abolish a licit regime. The regime did not have to be Christian,\nbut a non-Christian regime could not be overthrown solely on the\ngrounds of injustice.\n\nSoto never denied that God is the ultimate origin of the Christian\ncommonwealth, but he distinguished between the natural and\nsupernatural order and held that, in the natural, temporal order,\npeace and tranquility have to be guaranteed by the commonwealth and\ncan be identified with the bonum commune (Grimm 2017:\n74\u201377; Soto, De iustitia et iure I qu. I art. ii). This\ninternal peace, the bonum commune, is the aim of any\nlegitimate law; on the other hand, it is stabilized by just laws,\nwhich are more easily followed in a peaceful society. In this way, the\ntheologians of the School of Salamanca implicitly paved the way for a\nsecular understanding of the state as a human institution that\npreserves peace and prosperity within a society. There are differences\nbetween some of the authors concerning the anthropological question of\nwhether human organizations and the distribution of property were\nalready to be found in statu innocentiae or only later, after\nthe Fall, when domination and property became necessary because of\nhuman weakness. \n\nMolina explained why and how domination was introduced after the Fall,\ncoining the term dominium iurisdictionis for temporal power,\nin contrast to dominium proprietatis (De iustitia et\niure II 20, II 22, II 23; Brett 2014), in order to avoid the\nequivocal use of the term dominium that had confused\ndiscussions since the debate on Franciscan poverty in thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries (Brett 1997). The political authority of the\ncommonwealth\u2014res publica\u2014is directly given by\nGod, as it was difficult to imagine that there was a new contract in\nevery generation. Nevertheless, the power (potestas) of the\ngovernment comes only indirectly from God and directly from the\nrepublic (De iustitia et iure II 26.4). Molina accepted the\ncommon Salamancan view that communities had transferred power to\nrulers.\n\nAll dominion was founded on natural reason, shared even by\nnon-Christians. \u201cGovernment is the channel through which the\nnatural power of the commonwealth is exercised\u201d (Costello 1983:\n49). Therefore, if a government misuses its power by trying to\nexercise a dominium proprietatis over its citizen, that is,\ntreating them like slaves, there is a right to resist. This also holds\nfor a king, notwithstanding that, for Molina, monarchy was the best\nform of government (De iustitia et iure II 23.10). While this\nresistance has to be supported by the common will of the citizens in\nthe case of abuse of power by a legitimate ruler, every citizen has\nthe right to kill an illegitimate usurper of power (ibid., III\n6.2).\n\nSu\u00e1rez believed that individual peoples reached agreement on\nthe need for government. God then granted rulers power to direct\nhumanity toward its proper ends. Critics of his thought, like Robert\nFilmer, objected to bringing in God at this late stage, in order to\nexplain the formation of regimes, rather than emphasizing his role in\nthe creation of commonwealths since Adam (Filmer 1680, chap. II [2]).\nSu\u00e1rez thought that it was the responsibility of the ruler to\npromote harmony between subjects, to exercise power well and to enact\nlaws to perfect the community. He also treated the relationship of law\nto conscience and that of ecclesiastical to lay powers. Like many\nrepresentatives of Spanish Scholasticism, Su\u00e1rez favored\nmonarchy, within limits, as the best regime. Individuals had the right\nto self-defense, as did the society as a whole, and they might resist\na ruler who acted badly. Su\u00e1rez even contemplated the\npossibility that tyrants could be killed for threatening the survival\nof the commonwealth. In his polemics against King James I of England,\nhe argued for the immunity of the Church from control by lay regimes.\nThe English oath, the so-called oath of allegiance that King James had\nrequired his subjects to take in 1606, the year after the Gunpowder\nPlot, he said, violated this immunity and undermined obedience to the\nRoman pontiff in spiritual matters. Su\u00e1rez was willing to\nbelieve that the pope could exhort the people to rise up against a\ntyrant or to invoke the aid of outsiders against one. Except in such\ncases, however, Christians were to obey their lay rulers in conformity\nwith natural law. This right to resistance was widely taken for\ngranted by the Jesuits and considerably expanded by Juan de Mariana\n(1536\u20131624). Although recent scholarship has cast doubt on the\ntraditional labeling of Mariana as an exponent of popular sovereignty\nand tyrannicide (Braun 2007), the Catholic zealot who assassinated\nHenry IV of France in 1610 is known to have referred to his\nwritings.\n",
