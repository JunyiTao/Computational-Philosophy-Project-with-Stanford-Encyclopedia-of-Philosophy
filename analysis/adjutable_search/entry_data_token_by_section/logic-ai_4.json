    "main_text": "Causal Reasoning\n5. Causal Reasoning\n\n\nIn\n Section 4.6,\n we traced the reasons\nfor the development of theories incorporating causality in work on\nreasoning about action and change. This is not the only area of AI in\nwhich causality has emerged. Causality figures in qualitative reasoning\nabout devices; for Herbert Simon\u2019s important work in this area, which\ngoes back to the 1950s, see\n Simon 1952;\n 1977;\n Iwasaki & Simon 1986.\n Both these\ntraditions are important. But the most robust and highly developed\nprogram in AI relating to causality is that of Judea Pearl and his\nstudents and associates, which derives from statistical techniques\nknown as structural equation models.  \nHalpern and Pearl 2001 introduced\nthe idea that causal relations among events could be inferred from\nthese models: Bayesian belief networks could be interpreted as \ncausal networks.\n\n\nPearl\u2019s program has developed into a far-reaching campaign to\nrehabilitate causality in statistical thinking. We shall not discuss this\ntopic here. For one thing, this survey omits probabilistic reasoning in\nAI. For another, Pearl\u2019s views on causality are systematically and\ncomprehensively presented in a recent book-length study,\n Pearl 2000.\n\n\nBut it is important to point out that the work on causality discussed\n in\n Section 4.6\n and Pearl\u2019s ideas do share\nsome common themes. On both approaches: action is central for\ncausality. Also there is a focus on causality as a tool in reasoning\nthat is necessitated in part by limited resources. Another important\ntheme is the deployment and systematic study of formalisms in which\ncausality is related to other constructs (in particular, to probability\nand to qualitative change) and a variety of realistic reasoning\nproblems are addressed.\n\n\nThese commonalities provide reason to hope that we will see a\nscience of causality emerging from the AI research, unifying the\ncontributions of the probabilistic, the qualitative physics, and the\nnonmonotonic traditions, and illuminating the various phases of causal\nreasoning.\n\n\n A recent landmark in this direction is \nHalpern 2016, which develops and\napplies the general theory of event causality that arises from the\ncausal network approach.  Although Halpern is a computer scientist,  a\nlarge part of this book is philosophical, exploring notions such\nas blame and explanation.  But the book also explores practical\napplications of the approach that would not occur to philosophers,\nin areas such as software fault diagnosis.\n\n\nWhether you take causality to be a fundamental construct in natural\nscience, or a fundamental common sense phenomenon, depends on whether\nyou have in mind an idealized nature described by differential\nequations or you have in mind the view of nature we have to take in\norder to act, either in everyday situations, or for that matter in\ndesigning experiments in the laboratory. The fact that, as Bertrand\nRussell noted (see\n Russell 1957),\ncausality is not to be found as a theoretical primitive in contemporary\nphysical theories is at odds with its seeming importance in so many\nfamiliar areas of reasoning. The rigorous theories emerging in AI that\nare beginning to illuminate the workings of causality are important not\nonly in themselves, but in their potentiality to illuminate wider\nphilosophical issues.\n",
