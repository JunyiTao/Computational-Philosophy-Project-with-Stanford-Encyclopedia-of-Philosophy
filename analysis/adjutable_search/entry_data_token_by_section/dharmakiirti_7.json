    "main_text": "Logic and Philosophy of logic\n3. Logic and Philosophy of logic\n\nThe way the Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti school represent the mental\nprocess of reasoning is that one thinks: \u201cA is\nB because of being C, like D.\u201d More\nspecifically, one invokes a logical reason C to prove the\ntruth of the conclusion A is B; the example\nD, which is actually sometimes omitted, is a commonly\nacknowledged case of B-ness and C-ness that permits\nan individual to understand that all Cs are indeed\nBs. The latter generalization is known as\n\u201cpervasion\u201d (vy\u0101pti; Tibetan khyab\npa) of C by B\u2014a universally generalized\nmaterial implication, for all x: if x is C then x is B, with\nthe interesting feature that the quantification ranges over both\nactual and non-actual items. (The indispensability or dispensability\nof the example for one to ascertain/establish the pervasion becomes a\nhotly debated topic amongst later\n theoreticians.[49])\n\nThere is also an important variant where the truth of\n\u201cA is B\u201d is not being established, but\nonly the fact that it would follow from an acceptance\n(abhyupagama) of A being C. Thus a debater\ncan present an opponent with a prasa\u1e45ga (consequence)\nof the sort: \u201cIt would follow absurdly that A would be\nB, because of being C.\u201d Such a consequence\nwill constitute the key step in a proof by reductio ad absurdum, a\nproof that will culminate in a type of contraposition, turning on\nmodus tollens. When the pervasion in the consequence holds\nand the opponent understands that A is not in fact\nB, the opponent will then be led by a \u201ccontraposition\nof the consequence\u201d (prasa\u1e45gaviparyaya, literally\n\u201creversing the consequence\u201d) to understand that A\nis not in fact C because of not being B. Both these\nstructures, i.e., proofs by logical reasons and consequences, are to\nbe found in Indian and Tibetan writing on a variety of subjects.\n",
