    "main_text": "The claims of multiculturalism\n1. The claims of multiculturalism\n\nMulticulturalism is closely associated with \u201cidentity\npolitics,\u201d \u201cthe politics of difference,\u201d and\n\u201cthe politics of recognition,\u201d all of which share a\ncommitment to revaluing disrespected identities and changing dominant\npatterns of representation and communication that marginalize certain\ngroups (Gutmann 2003, Taylor 1992, Young 1990). Multiculturalism\ninvolves not only claims of identity and culture as some critics of\nmulticulturalism suggest. It is also a matter of economic interests\nand political power: it includes demands for remedying economic and\npolitical disadvantages that people suffer as a result of their\nmarginalized group identities.\n\nMulticulturalists take for granted that it is \u201cculture\u201d\nand \u201ccultural groups\u201d that are to be recognized and\naccommodated. Yet multicultural claims include a wide range of claims\ninvolving religion, language, ethnicity, nationality, and race.\nCulture is a contested, open-ended concept, and all of these\ncategories have been subsumed by or equated with the concept of\nculture. Disaggregating and distinguishing among different types of\nclaims can clarify what is at stake (Song 2008). Language and religion\nare at the heart of many claims for cultural accommodation by\nimmigrants. The key claim made by minority nations is for\nself-government rights. Race has a more limited role in multicultural\ndiscourse. Antiracism and multiculturalism are distinct but related\nideas: the former highlights \u201cvictimization and\nresistance\u201d whereas the latter highlights \u201ccultural life,\ncultural expression, achievements, and the like\u201d (Blum 1992,\n14). Claims for recognition in the context of multicultural education\nare demands not just for recognition of aspects of a group\u2019s actual\nculture (e.g. African American art and literature) but also for\nacknowledgment of the history of group subordination and its\nconcomitant experience (Gooding-Williams 1998).\n\nExamples of cultural accommodations or \u201cgroup-differentiated\nrights\u201d include exemptions from generally applicable law (e.g.\nreligious exemptions), assistance to do things that members of the majority culture are already enabled to do (e.g. multilingual ballots, funding for minority\nlanguage schools and ethnic associations, affirmative action),\nrepresentation of minorities in government bodies (e.g. ethnic quotas\nfor party lists or legislative seats, minority-majority Congressional\ndistricts), recognition of traditional legal codes by the dominant\nlegal system (e.g. granting jurisdiction over family law to religious\ncourts), or limited self-government rights (e.g. qualified recognition\nof tribal sovereignty, federal arrangements recognizing the political\nautonomy of Qu\u00e9bec) (for a helpful classification of cultural\nrights, see Levy 1997).\n\nTypically, a group-differentiated right is a right of a minority group\n(or a member of such a group) to act or not act in a certain way in\naccordance with their religious obligations and/or cultural\ncommitments. In some cases, it is a right that directly restricts the\nfreedom of non-members in order to protect the minority group\u2019s\nculture, as in the case of restrictions on the use of the English\nlanguage in Qu\u00e9bec. When the right-holder is the group, the\nright may protect group rules that restrict the freedom of individual\nmembers, as in the case of the Pueblo membership rule that excludes\nthe children of women who marry outside the group. Now that you have a\nsense of the kinds of claims that have been made in the name of\nmulticulturalism, we can now turn to consider different normative\njustifications for these claims.\n",
