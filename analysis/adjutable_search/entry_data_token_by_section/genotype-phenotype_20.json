    "main_text": "What the Genotype-Phenotype Distinction Signifies || Findings About Heredity Derived Using One Meaning of Terms Affirm Findings Derived Using a Different Meaning\n7. Coda on Causality\n\nThe introduction noted that, if the genotype-phenotype\nrelationship had been the focus of this entry, more attention\nwould need to be given to philosophical arguments about causality and\nabout abstraction as it relates to causal claims. Yet, realizing any\nof the programs of reintegration mentioned in this entry would entail\nrich causal analyses: networks of gene regulation linked to organized\nstructures that branch into more organized structures, epigenetic\nmodifications during and across lifespans, organisms shaping the\ndynamics of the ecological context in which they develop their traits,\nand frequencies of traits changing in populations over generations.\nThis said, in realms of experimentally controlled biological materials\nand conditions, a simpler sense of causality may seem plausible,\nnamely, a difference that makes a difference (see entry on\n causation and manipulability).\n (The serious debate about whether statistical analysis can\ndistinguish causal from non-causal differences that \u201cmake\u201d\na difference should be noted; Hern\u00e1n et al. 2002.) The\nconnection between an association within some population and causal\nmechanisms is susceptible to disconfirmation by experiments. At the\nsame time, doing such experiments invites scrutiny of the relationship\nof experimentally altered dynamics to the original dynamics that\ngenerated the data that were analyzed to show the original statistical\nassociation (Taylor 2015). \n\nMost importantly given the framing of this entry around control and\nreintegration: Any experimental as well as statistical association is\nalso conditional on the subset of the population or species\nstudied and the situations where they are observed (Lewontin 1974b).\nUnderstanding associations and formulating manipulations based on them\nrequires attention to what has been experimentally or, at least,\nstatistically held constant. In other words, in controlled conditions\nthe direction of the arrow labeled identification in Figures\n 2\n and\n 3\n may be reversed and given a causal connotation, but the causality is\nconditional on the factors, including the rest of the organism, held\nconstant. The understanding and manipulations may well extrapolate\nbeyond the original, controlled population and situations (and thus\nmatch the general theory summarized in\n Figure 1),\n but, absent an actual program of reintegration, there is no basis for\nassuming that they will. While Waters (2007), Tabery (2014) and others\nwould give greater status to differences that have actually\nbeen observed to make a difference (Griffiths & Stotz 2013), this\nentry has pointed to the control of biological materials and\nconditions that excludes many factors\u2014genetic as well\nas environmental, structural as well as particulate\u2014from\nbeing seen to make a difference. Ironically, if\nappearances are not to mislead and obscure, or be spun into\nspeculative theories\n (section 2),\n the science of heredity needs methods that bring back what was\nabstracted away under the experimental control that made\nJohannsen\u2019s original genotype-conception meaningful.\n\n",
