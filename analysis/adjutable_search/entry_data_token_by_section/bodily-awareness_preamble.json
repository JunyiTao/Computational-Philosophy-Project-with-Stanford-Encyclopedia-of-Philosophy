    "main_text": "\n\nAt the sensory level we continuously receive a flow of information\nabout our own body through external and internal perceptions. Not only\ncan we see our body and touch it, but we also have several inner\nreceptors that convey information about the position of our limbs, the\nbalance of our body, and its physiological condition. Unlike external\nperception, the inner sensory flow never stops and cannot be\nvoluntarily controlled. Thus, an important amount of information is\nconstantly available whether we want it or not, whether we pay\nattention to it or not. In that respect, our body qualifies as the\nobject that we know best. Yet, despite numerous sources of\ninformation, the phenomenology of bodily awareness is limited. In\npainful and learning situations, our body appears at the core of our\ninterest, but when we walk in the street, we are rarely aware of the\nprecise position of our legs and of the contact of the floor on our\nfeet. Schwitzgebel (2007), for instance, asked how frequently\nparticipants wearing a device beeping at random intervals had tactile\nexperiences in their left foot just before the beeping sound. He found\na high variability in the answers, but one participant reported\ntactile sensations only 16% of the time. Our conscious field is\nprimarily occupied by our environment, instead of the bodily medium\nthat allows us to perceive it and to move through it. Hence, the most\npermanent and preponderant object in life may also be the most elusive\none (Leder 1990; Merleau-Ponty 1945; O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980).\n\nOne may then question whether we are completely unaware of it. Except\nin rare illusory or pathological cases, we never feel fully\ndisembodied. James (1890: 242), for instance, claims that we are\nconstantly conscious of the presence of our body, although at the\nmargin of the stream of our consciousness: \n\n\nOur own bodily position, attitude, condition, is one of the things of\nwhich some awareness, however inattentive, invariably accompanies the\nknowledge of whatever else we know. \n\n\nSimilarly, Gurwitsch (1985: 60) asserts: \n\n\nWe are immediately and directly aware of our body, at least in\nmarginal form, at every moment of our lives, under all circumstances,\nand at whatever place we might happen to find ourselves. \n\n\nBut what is the content of this marginal body consciousness? It seems\nto be reducible to the \u201cfeeling of the same old body always\nthere\u201d or to a mere \u201cfeeling of warmth and intimacy\u201d\n(James 1890: 242). But can we go beyond this rough and metaphorical\ndescription?\n\nAlthough for a long time the exclusive province of phenomenology\n(Husserl 1913; Gurwitsch 1985; Merleau-Ponty 1945; Henri 1965; de\nPreester 2007; Gallagher 2005; Legrand 2006; Mishara 2004; Carman\n1999), bodily awareness has attracted more and more attention from\nphilosophers from all traditions, leading among others to several\nmonographs and multidisciplinary volumes (for instance, see\nBerm\u00fadez et al. (eds.) 1995; Knoblich et al. (eds.) 2005;\nFulkerson 2014; Vignemont & Alsmith (eds.) 2017; Berm\u00fadez\n2018; Vignemont 2018; Guillot\n& Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (eds.) forthcoming; Tsakiris & de\nPreester (eds.) 2018; Vignemont, Serino et al. (eds.) forthcoming). This\nruns in parallel with a boom of research in cognitive neuroscience. In\nparticular, bodily illusions have raised a wide range of philosophical\nquestions about the underlying mechanisms of bodily self-awareness,\nquestions that are still open nowadays. For instance, it has been\nfound that if one looks at a rubber hand, while one\u2019s own hand\nis hidden, and both the rubber and the real hands are synchronously\nstroked, one can report feeling as if the rubber hand were one\u2019s\nhand (Botvinick & Cohen 1998). The rubber hand illusion has been\ntaken as the key for understanding bodily self-awareness. Yet, after\nmore than twenty years of research, what have we really learnt about\nthe body and the self?\n\nThe entry first describes the special way one has of knowing\none\u2019s body from the inside. After comparing it with visual\nawareness and assessing its epistemological significance, it will ask\nwhether it should be understood as a form of perception. The entry\nwill then discuss the involvement of mental representations for bodily\nawareness, specifically exploring its relation with action and the\nnotion of body schema. In the last section, the entry will review\nseveral accounts of the sense of bodily ownership.\n",
