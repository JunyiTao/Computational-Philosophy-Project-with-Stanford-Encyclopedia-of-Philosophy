    "main_text": "Shannon\u2019s concept of information\n2. Shannon\u2019s concept of information\nIt is common to begin the analysis of information in biology with\nan uncontroversial but minimal notion: a causal or correlational\nconception. Smoke in the air and fire in the forest are correlated\nwith one another. If you see a forest burning at night, you can\npredict the air will be smoky. If you see a plume of smoke rising from\nabove the trees, you can predict that below there is a fire. The\ncorrelation does not have to be perfect to be informative. Putting the\npoint generally, a signal carries information about a source, in this\nsense, if we can predict the state of the source from the signal. This\nsense of information is associated with Claude Shannon (1948) who\nshowed how the concept of information could be used\nto quantify facts about contingency and correlation in a\nuseful way, initially for use in communication technology. For\nShannon, anything is a source of information if it has a\nnumber of alternative states that might be realized on a particular\noccasion. Any other variable contains some information about\nthat source, or carries information about it, if its state is correlated with the state of the source. This is a matter of degree; a signal carries more information\nabout a source if its state is a better predictor of the source, less\ninformation if it is a worse predictor. \nIn this sense, a signal can carry information about a source\nwithout there being any biological system designed to produce that\nsignal, nor any to use it once produced. When a biologist employs this\nsense of information in a description of gene action or of other\nprocesses, he or she is just adopting a quantitative framework for\ndescribing ordinary correlations or causal connections within those\nsystems. So it is one thing for there to be a signal carrying\ninformation about a source; quite another to explain biological\nprocesses as the result of signalling. The familiar example of tree\nrings is helpful here. When a tree lays down rings, it establishes a\nstructure that can be used by us to make inferences about the\npast. The number and size of the rings carry information, in\nShannon\u2019s sense, about the history of the tree and its\ncircumstances (the technique, \u201cdendrochronology\u201d, is\nscientifically important). Despite the usefulness of the informational\ndescription, there is no sense in which we are explaining how\nthe tree does what it does in informational terms. The only reader or\nuser of the information in the tree rings is the human observer. The\ntree itself does not exploit the information in its rings to control\nits growth or flowering. Similarly, we might note ways in which the\ndistribution of different DNA sequences within and between biological\npopulations \u201ccarries information about\u201d the historical\nrelationships between those populations, and the histories of the\nindividual populations themselves. Using this information has given\nevolutionary biologists a much richer and more reliable picture of the\nhistory of life (for a good introduction to these uses see Bromham\n2008). It has been argued, for example, that the greater diversity in\nmitochondrial DNA in African populations, in comparison to other human\npopulations, is an indicator of a comparatively recent human dispersal\nfrom an African origin. In making these inferences, informational\nconcepts can be useful tools. But this is just a more complicated\nversion of what is going on in the case of tree rings. The appeal to\ninformation has an inferential use that is no\nway explanatory. A large proportion of the informational\ndescriptions found in biology have this character.\nThe border between these two categories, however, can be hard to\ndiscern. Steven Frank (2012) has developed a detailed mapping between\nequations describing change due to natural selection and equations\nused in information theory. Change across generations can be seen as\nthe accumulation of information by a population about its\nenvironment. So far, there is no claim that populations use this\ninformation in any way, and the situation is akin to that found in\ntree rings: a tree accumulates, in its rings, information about\nclimatic conditions in its past, though the tree does nothing with\nthat information. Frank may view the role of information acquired by\nevolution in a more substantive way: \u201cselection causes\npopulations to accumulate information about the fit of characters to\nthe environment\u201d (2012: 2391). But it is doubtful that anything more\nthan an inferential role has yet been shown for this kind of\ninformation.\nConsequently, philosophers have sometimes set the discussion up by\nsaying that there is one kind of \u201cinformation\u201d appealed to\nin biology, the kind originally described by Shannon, that is\nunproblematic and does not require much philosophical attention. The\nterm \u201ccausal\u201d information is also sometimes used to refer\nto this concept, and this is essentially Grice\u2019s \u201cnatural\nmeaning\u201d, (see entry on Grice) from his\nwork in the philosophy of language (Grice 1957). Information in this\nsense exists whenever there is contingency and correlation. So we can\nsay that genes contain information about the proteins they make, and\nalso that genes contain information about the whole-organism\nphenotype. But when we say that, we are saying no more than what we\nare saying when we say that there is an informational connection\nbetween smoke and fire, or between tree rings and a tree\u2019s\nage. The more contentious question becomes whether or not biology\nneeds another, richer concept of information as\nwell. Information in this richer sense is sometimes called\n\u201csemantic\u201d or \u201cintentional\u201d information.\nWhy might we think that biology needs to employ a richer concept?\nOne thought is that genes play a special, instructional role in\ndevelopment, telling the embryo how to grow. It is true that genes\ncarry Shannon-information about phenotypes: the genome of a fertilized\negg predicts much of the resulting phenotype. In mammals, for example,\nchromosome structure predicts the sex of the adult animal. But if an\ninformational relationship between gene and phenotype is supposed to\ninvolve a distinctive instruction-like mode of causation, then this\ncannot be information in Shannon\u2019s sense.  For environmental\nfactors, not just genes, \u201ccarry information\u201d about\nphenotypes, in Shannon\u2019s sense. With respect to Shannon\ninformation, there is a \u201cparity\u201d between the roles of\nenvironmental and genetic causes (Griffiths and Gray 1994). Moreover,\nif we are using Shannon\u2019s concept, then the informational\nrelationship between genotype and phenotype is symmetrical. For\nexample, once a reader knows that both authors of this article are\nmale, they can predict that we both carry a Y-chromosome.  Some talk\nabout information in biology is consistent with these features of\nShannon information, but some is not. In particular, it is usually\nthought that at least some applications of informational language to\ngenes ascribe to them a property that is not ascribed to\nenvironmental conditions, even when the environment is predictively\nimportant.\nIn addition, a message that carries \u201csemantic\ninformation\u201d, it is often thought, has the capacity\nto mis-represent, as well as accurately represent, what it is\nabout. There is a capacity for error. Shannon information does not\nhave that feature; we cannot say that one variable \u201ccarried\nfalse information\u201d about another, if we are using Shannon\u2019s\nsense of the term. But biologists do apparently want to use language\nof that kind when talking about genes. Genes carry a message that\nis supposed to be expressed, whether or not it actually is\nexpressed. Thus the developmental disorders caused by thalidomide in\nthe 1960s were due to an inability to use genetic signals\nthat were supposed to control limb development. These genes\nwere present and active; thalidomide did not do its harm by causing\nmutations.\nThese are the usual \u201cmarks\u201d that are taken in the\nliterature to show that a richer sense of information than\nShannon\u2019s has been introduced to biology. But the most crucial\ndifference between the less and more contentious applications of\ninformational concepts is that, in the richer cases, information use\nis supposed to help explain how biological systems do what\nthey do\u2014how cells work, how an egg can develop into an adult,\nhow genetic inheritance mechanisms make the evolution of complex\nphenotypes possible.\nAt this point, there are a number of options on the table. One is\nto deny that genes, cells and other biological structures literally\ntraffic in information in ways that explain their behaviour, but to\nargue nevertheless that this is a useful analogy or model. The idea is\nthat there are useful similarities between paradigm cases of information and\nrepresentation using systems\u2014cognitively sophisticated agents,\nthinking and communicating with one another\u2014and biological\nsystems. Hormones, for example, are usefully thought of as messages\nbecause they are small, stable, energetically inexpensive items that\ncan travel long distances (relative to their own size) without\ndecaying, to specialized locations where they have\npredictable, specific, and important effects on arrival. But while\nthis is a helpful way of thinking, perhaps we should not take talk of\nmessages too seriously. For example, we should not treat a question\nabout whether prolactin is a report of pregnancy or an instruction to\nthe mammary glands as if it had a literally correct answer. Arnon Levy\nhas developed the most sophisticated version of this view of\nbiological information (Levy 2011). \nA second option is to argue that genes and other biological\nstructures literally carry semantic information, and their\ninformational character explains the distinctive role of these\nstructures in biological processes. If we think of genes or cells as\nliterally carrying semantic information, our problem changes; who or\nwhat could count as composing or reading these messages? Paradigm\ncases of structures with semantic information\u2014pictures,\nsentences, programs\u2014are built by the thought and action of\nintelligent agents. So we need to show how genes and\ncells\u2014neither intelligent systems themselves nor the products of\nintelligence\u2014can carry semantic information, and how the\ninformation they carry explains their biological role. We need some\nkind of reductive explanation of semantic information (arguably, we\nneed this to understand cognition, too). One place we might look for\nsuch an analysis is naturalistic philosophy of mind.\nA third option is to argue that causal information itself can\nexplain biological phenomena, and no additional concept of information\nis needed. Biological systems, on this view, can be adapted to send or\nreceive signals that carry causal information. Elevated prolactin, for\nexample, does covary with pregnancy, and that is no\naccident. Likewise, the production of milk is a designed response to\nthe registration of these elevated levels at the mammary glands. While\nit is true that lactation carries as much causal information about\nprolactin levels as those levels carry about milk flow, there is a\nphysical asymmetry, hence directionality, between source and\nreceiver. (After birth, suckling stimulates local production of\nprolactin, so the physical asymmetry is the signal of pregnancy from\nthe pituitary gland to the breasts, tuning them for lactation). Brian\nSkyrms\u2019 work has been very important in returning causal\ninformation to centre stage, in part because his work shows that\nsender-receiver signalling systems need not be cognitively\nsophisticated agents (Skyrms 2010). Sending and receiving causal\ninformation can emerge and stabilise amongst simple systems; certainly\namongst systems no more complex than a cell.\n",
