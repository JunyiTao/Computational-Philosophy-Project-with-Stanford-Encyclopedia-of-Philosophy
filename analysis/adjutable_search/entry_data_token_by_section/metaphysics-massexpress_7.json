    "main_text": "Stuff as a Special Kind of Thing or Things || Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Many Things, Not One Thing: Pluralities and Plural Reference\n2.3 Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Many Things, Not One Thing: Pluralities and Plural Reference\n\nWe do not only speak of individual things, we speak of many things.\nSentences such as \u201cThe cheerleaders formed a human\npyramid,\u201d or \u201cThose dogs are sick\u201d are examples of\nplural predication, quantification, and reference. Some hold that some\nplural referring expressions are irreducible to singular predication,\nquantification, and reference (Boolos 1984; McKay 2005; Yi 2005).\nAccording to standard logic, \u201csome things are F\u201d\nis true only if each of those things is F. But, as McKay and\nothers point out, \u201cThe students surrounded the building\u201d\ncould be true even though it is false to say of Bob (one of the\nstudents) that he surrounded the building (McKay 2005, chapter 1).\nThose in favor of plural logic argue that we need not countenance sums\nor sets to account for plural logic, rather, we can take such\nsentences at face value. Those tigers may be distinct from those\nlions, but this doesn\u2019t require \u2018the tigers\u2019 to\nrefer to a collection, sum, or particular thing of any stripe.\n\nSome \u2018pluralists\u2019, as we may call those who analyze mass\nexpressions in terms of plural expressions, hold that mass terms are\nused, generally, to refer to many things at once (Nicolas 2002).\n\u2018Gold\u2019, on most occasions of use, does not refer to a\nthing\u2014it refers to many things.\n\nAccording to an early account (Laycock 1975) statements such as\n\u201cthe water is boiling\u201d or \u201cBob took out that\ntrash\u201d mean \u201cthose water molecules are\nboiling\u201d and \u201cBob took out those pieces of\ntrash.\u201d The idea (also developed more fully later by Nicolas\n2008, who, in turn, was inspired by Gillon 1992) that mass expressions\nare used to refer to several things at once seems especially promising\nfor concrete quasi-mass nouns such as silverware and\nfurniture, whose reference is particular pieces of silverware\nor furniture. Concrete mass nouns such as beer will be\nparaphrased as referring, depending on context, to bottles, drops,\nglasses, gallons, or quantities (in Cartwright\u2019s 1979b sense) of\nbeer.\n\nPluralists about mass expressions differ most markedly from sum and\nset theorists as follows. The set theorist would take \u2018the water\nin Merrihew\u2019s cup\u2019 to refer to the set of water molecules\nin his cup, and the sum theorist would take it to refer to a fusion.\nThese are both particular entities. But, for the Pluralist, the water\nis not a particular thing\u2014it is many things. For example, the\naccount that Nicolas recommends\n\n\nassociates to a mass noun [M], not a set of things, but some\nthings, each of which is M\u2026the denotation of the\nexpression the gold on the table, the as, comprises\nany things that are gold on the table. (2008, 22)\n\n\nMany claim that plural logic, reference, predication, and\nquantification is ontologically innocent. That is, we are not\ncommitting ourselves the existence of new entities by employing\nplurals, even if we believe that some usage featuring plural reference\nis irreducible. Being committed to the existence of \u2018those\ncats\u2019 (while adverting to Mr. Furrikens, Chairman Meow, and\nMagnificat) is not an additional commitment over and above the\ncommitment to Mr. Furrikens, Chairman Meow, and Magnificat. When one\npays for this apple, and that apple, one gets \u2018the apples\u2019\nfor free. In this respect the ontologically innocent Pluralist has a\nleg up over the set and sums theorists, since the former posits no\nnovel entities. But, to be fair, some sum theorists have argued that\npositing sums is \u2018ontologically innocent\u2019\u2014i.e., when\nwe have two things, positing a sum of those two things does not\nintroduce anything in addition to the initial two things. So, there\nmay be parity in this\n respect.[21]\n\nIn some of his early work Laycock makes arguments by analogy to\nsupport the proposal that mass expressions are veiled plural\nexpressions, so that water, in its analysis, gets treated\nlike apples or Hobbits does. We turn to the\nanalogies.\n\nBoth mass and plural terms refer cumulatively. Just as any two\nportions of water considered together are water, so these apples and\nthose apples together are apples.\n\nAlso, Hobbits, just like water, resists\npluralization. For the former, this is because Hobbits is already\nplural: \u2018Hobbitses\u2019 does not make sense. Water\ncannot be pluralized and retain its standard reference, since\n\u2018waters\u2019 either means kinds of water, or different\nbodies of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, pools, seas, rather\nthan numerous water per se, which doesn\u2019t make sense\nunless used in a technical or stipulative way). One way to explain\nthis is to suppose that water is already plural.\n\nBoth Hobbits and water do not take the indefinite\narticle. Neither \u2018a water\u2019 (when not understood in the\nkind sense or with an implicit partitioning e.g., \u2018bottle\nof\u2019) nor \u2018a Hobbits\u2019 are grammatical. Both mass and\nplural expressions take the definite article since \u2018the\u2019\n\u201cdoes not discriminate between singular and plural\u201d\n(Laycock 2006, p.\u200935). Both Hobbits and water\ntake the non-singular analogue of the indefinite\narticle\u2014\u2018some\u2019. Some Hobbits and some water can both\nsurround a castle, and neither use implies singularity.\n\nBoth mass and plural terms can be prefaced by partitioning and\nmeasurement terms. One could buy seven pounds of applesauce, or seven\npounds of apples. One could sell a jar of applesauce, or a box of\napples, a gallon of marbles, or a gallon of milk.\n\nBut, even given the aforementioned similarities, there are significant\ndifferences between mass and plural terms. While one can infer from\n\u201cThere are peppercorns in the sauce\u201d that there is at\nleast one peppercorn in the sauce, one cannot infer from \u201cThere\nis wine in the sauce\u201d that there is at least one (non-kind\nusage) wine in the sauce. Furthermore, every plural term (except for\nplural invariable terms such as \u2018cattle\u2019 and\n\u2018groceries\u2019) e.g., \u2018cats\u2019, is correlated with\na singular cognate, e.g., \u2018cat\u2019. But there are no singular\ncognates for mass terms e.g., \u2018water\u2019 or\n\u2018silverware\u2019\n\nThere is much to say for the pluralist position. Plural logic is\nbecoming better understood, less controversial, and a case can be made\nthat standard first-order logic will be subsumed under, or merged\nwith, plural logic (for discussion of these issues, see the entry on\n plural quantification).\n If this is so, and mass expressions are plural expressions, then mass\nexpressions can be accounted for in a relatively well understood and\nuncontroversial logic which accounts for a wider range of commonsense\ninferences than standard logic does.\n\nThe pluralist account is quite plausible when we consider atomic mass\nexpressions, or mass expressions with atomic denotata (def.\n\u2018atomic\u2019 in\n 1.4)\n such as \u2018silverware\u2019, \u2018furniture\u2019, and\n\u2018water\u2019. It will become easy to cash out the truth\nconditions of such talk in terms of the atomic units, such as pieces\nof silverware, furniture, and H2O molecules (Nicolas\n2008).\n\nAlso in favor of the account is that it does at least as good a job as\nthe set-theoretical view since it explains the relationship between a\nthing and its constituting matter in a similar way, yet posits no\nnovel entities like sets. There are just the many bits, and the\nconstituted object of which they are parts. This point has been stated\nforcefully by Laycock (1972) and Burke (1997), yet these accounts have\nthe worrying feature (for some) of not being truly reductive. See\nsection\n 3.1\n for an \u2018ontologically serious\u2019 view of pluralities.\n\nMany of the problems which beset the set theorist confront the\nPluralists as well. What about fuzzy atomless or gunky stuff? If talk\nof stuff is to be paraphrased in terms of plural reference, what are\nthe individuals slotted for this role? With atomic stuffs, it is\nclear. But with \u2018fruitcake\u2019 and \u2018taco sauce\u2019\nit is not. Why suppose there is a fact of the matter as to what counts\nas stuffs of these kinds? And if there is no fact of the matter then\nwhat are the individuals we are speaking of when we speak of\nfruitcake? And our Pluralist has just as much trouble chopping up the\nJello cube as the Set Theorist in\n 2.2.\n\nOf course, vagueness and indeterminacy are problems for most theories\nof masses, so it could be unfair to overstress this point, and it is\nnot at all clear that the pluralist can\u2019t augment her account\nwith standard logics of vagueness or employ analogues to set-theoretic\nnon-well-foundedness moves. (See Chierchia 2010 for an examination of\nvagueness and its relation to mass nouns, and a development of a\nplural approach, which can be found in many other articles, e.g.\nChierchia 1998a). Given the many salutary components of plural logic\nin relation to mass expressions, this remains a promising area of\ninquiry.\n",
