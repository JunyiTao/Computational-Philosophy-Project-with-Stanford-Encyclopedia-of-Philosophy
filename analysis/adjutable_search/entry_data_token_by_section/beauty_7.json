    "main_text": "The Politics of Beauty\n3. The Politics of Beauty\n\nKissing sounds nice, but some kisses are coerced, some pleasures\nobtained at a cost to other people. The political associations of\nbeauty over the last few centuries have been remarkably various and\nremarkably problematic, particularly in connection with race and\ngender, but in other aspects as well. This perhaps helps account for\nthe neglect of the issue in early-to-mid twentieth-century philosophy\nas well as its growth late in the century as an issue in social\njustice movements, and subsequently in social-justice oriented\nphilosophy.\n",
