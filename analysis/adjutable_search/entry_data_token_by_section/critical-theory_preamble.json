    "main_text": "\n\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: The following new entry by Robin Celikates\nand Jeffrey Flynn replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.]\n\n\n\u201cCritical theory\u201d refers to a family of theories that aim\nat a critique and transformation of society by integrating normative\nperspectives with empirically informed analysis of society\u2019s\nconflicts, contradictions, and tendencies. In a narrow sense,\n\u201cCritical Theory\u201d (often denoted with capital letters)\nrefers to the work of several generations of philosophers and social\ntheorists in the Western European Marxist tradition known as the\nFrankfurt School. Beginning in the 1930s at the Institute for Social\nResearch in Frankfurt, it is best known for interdisciplinary research\nthat combines philosophy and social science with the practical aim of\nfurthering emancipation. There are separate entries on influential\nfigures of the first generation of the Frankfurt School \u2013\n Max Horkheimer\n (1895\u20131973),\n Theodor W. Adorno\n (1903\u20131969),\n Herbert Marcuse\n (1898\u20131979), and\n Walter Benjamin\n (1892\u20131940) \u2013 and the leading figure of the second\ngeneration,\n J\u00fcrgen Habermas\n (b. 1929).\n\nIn a broader sense, there are many different strands of critical\ntheory that have emerged as forms of reflective engagement with the\nemancipatory goals of various social and political movements, such as\nfeminist theory, critical race theory, queer theory, and\npostcolonial/decolonial theory. In another, third sense,\n\u201ccritical theory\u201d or sometimes just \u201cTheory\u201d\nis used to refer to work by theorists associated with psychoanalysis\nand post-structuralism, such as\n Michel Foucault\n and\n Jacques Derrida\n (see these separate entries as well as the entry on\n postmodernism).\n\nThis entry is primarily focused on the critical theory of the\nFrankfurt School, but broadens outward at various points to discuss\nengagements by that tradition with a range of critical theories and\nsocial developments. The need for a broad approach to critical theory\nis prompted today by a range of contemporary social, political,\neconomic, and ecological crises and struggles as well as the critique\nof Eurocentric forms of knowledge production.\n",
