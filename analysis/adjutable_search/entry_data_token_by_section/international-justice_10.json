    "main_text": "The New Cosmopolitanism and Beyond || .3 National property\n5. Future directions\n\nIt is rarely a smart move to make predictions within philosophy.\nNevertheless, it is perhaps appropriate to offer a few views about\nwhat we are likely to see in future work about global justice. The\nfirst, following on our discussion of Pogge\u2019s work, is an\nincreased engagement by philosophers with empirical evidence and\nempirical methods. Apart from the pure egalitarians, political\nphilosophers all make assumptions about the nature and powers of\nglobal institutions; these assumptions can be grounded\u2014or\nrefuted\u2014by engagement with international lawyers, development\neconomists, and the like. To some extent, this engagement is already\nhappening (Reddy & Pogge 2010; Hassoun & Subramanian 2012;\nBenatar & Brock 2011). More of this engagement is, we believe,\nboth likely and likely to be beneficial. \n The second trend we would identify is that there is increasingly\nlikely a need for political philosophy dealing with specific global\nphenomena. Much of what we have dealt with here has looked only at the\nmacro-level phenomenon of global inequality. A full analysis of global\njustice will also look at specific forms of human institution and\nagency that are likely to be relevant from the standpoint of justice.\nWe have already mentioned, if only in passing, the issues of\nimmigration, fairness in trade, and feminism. We would conclude here\nby mentioning some other areas of inquiry that might become\nincreasingly important. Buchanan (2009) and Pogge (2009) have both\nproduced recent work on global incentives for pharmaceutical\nresearch. Ypi, Goodin, & Barry (2009) have written on the issue of\nglobal debt relief. Gardiner (2004) and Caney (2008, 2009) have\nwritten on the relationship of global climate change and global\ninequality. Increasingly, we believe that these sorts of analyses are\nlikely to proliferate, and philosophers come to terms not just with\nthe fact of inequality, but with the plurality of different reasons\nfor\u2014and solutions to\u2014that inequality.  Political\nphilosophy has only recently turned its attention to questions of\nglobal justice; it is our hope that this attention will deepen in\nyears to come, as we gain more understanding of the nature and causes\nof global underdevelopment and inequality.\n The final trend might be the most important; we are increasingly\nwilling to move beyond the questions that animated Rawlsian analyses\nof global distributive justice, to a broader consideration of the\nagents and institutions that might be implicated in our global\nprocesses of production. Iris Marion Young (2011) raises some\nimportant questions about how to begin to understand the various\nagents whose acts might be constrained by moral theorizing\u2014and\nhow to understand the distinct ways in which our identities, as\nconsumers and as citizens, might be implicated in the replication of\npoverty and inequality. Although this entry began with an examination\nof the Rawlsian tradition of thinking about distributive justice, it\nis an entirely good thing that the philosophical literature is\nincreasingly willing to move beyond that tradition. As global\nrelationships become more complicated and more central, we stand in\nneed of more theorizing about how to understand the relationship\nbetween global wealth and global poverty\u2014and about the moral\nprinciples within which that relationship is to be understood.\n",
