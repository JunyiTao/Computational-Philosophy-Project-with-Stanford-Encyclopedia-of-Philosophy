    "main_text": "Demonstration || Questions\n6.2 Questions\n\nThe four Aristotelian questions\u2014if, that, what, and\nwhy\u2014discussed in Posterior Analytics B1\u20132 are\nsubject to a more systematic analysis in Avicenna\u2019s\nBurh\u0101n I.5 and IV.1. In Burh\u0101n I.5, in particular, they are rearranged in three pairs with\nseveral internal subdivisions: (i) what (m\u0101), with\nrespect to the meaning of the name or with respect to the essence;\n(ii) why (lim\u0101), with respect to unqualified existence or\nwith respect to existence in a given state; and (iii) if (hal)/that\n(anna), again with respect to unqualified existence or with respect to existence in\na given state. The notion of existence in a state in (ii) and (iii) encapsulates the case of attribute ascription in its causal and factual version, respectively. The three pairs of questions may apply to both subject\nand predicate of a scientific statement.\n\nAvicenna explores various relations and concludes that what- and\nif-questions, in some of their declensions, are more fundamental in\ncharacter, as why-questions ultimately reduce to questions about the\nessence of something, and if-questions express crucial necessary\nconditions for any science, namely the existence of basic entities in\nits domain and the assumption of certain fundamental predicative\nclaims about them.\n\nThe classification of questions is inspired by the idea of reducing them\nto the two basic paths of scientific knowledge: conception and\nassertion and their discursive counterparts, definition and syllogism\n(Strobino 2015b).\n",
