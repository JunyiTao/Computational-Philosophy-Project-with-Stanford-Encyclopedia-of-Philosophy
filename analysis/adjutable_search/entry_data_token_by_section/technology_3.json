    "main_text": "Analytic Philosophy of Technology || Introduction: Science and Technology\u2019s Different Relations to Philosophy\n2.1 Introduction: Science and Technology\u2019s Different Relations to Philosophy\n\nIt may come as a surprise to those new to the topic that the fields of\nphilosophy of science and philosophy of technology show such great\ndifferences, given that few practices in our society are as closely\nrelated as science and engineering. Experimental science is nowadays\ncrucially dependent on technology for the realization of its research\nset-ups and for gathering and analyzing data. The phenomena that\nmodern science seeks to study could never be discovered without\nproducing them through technology.\n\nTheoretical research within technology has come to be often\nindistinguishable from theoretical research in science, making\nengineering science largely continuous with \u2018ordinary\u2019 or\n\u2018pure\u2019 science. This is a relatively recent development,\nwhich started around the middle of the nineteenth century, and is\nresponsible for great differences between modern technology and\ntraditional, craft-like techniques. The educational training that\naspiring scientists and engineers receive starts off being largely\nidentical and only gradually diverges into a science or an engineering\ncurriculum. Ever since the scientific revolution of the seventeenth\ncentury, characterized by its two major innovations, the experimental\nmethod and the mathematical articulation of scientific theories,\nphilosophical reflection on science has focused on the method by which\nscientific knowledge is generated, on the reasons for thinking\nscientific theories to be true, or approximately true, and on the\nnature of evidence and the reasons for accepting one theory and\nrejecting another. Hardly ever have philosophers of science posed\nquestions that did not have the community of scientists, their\nconcerns, their aims, their intuitions, their arguments and choices,\nas a major target. In contrast it is only recently that the philosophy\nof technology has discovered the community of engineers.\n\nIt might be claimed that it is up to the philosophy of technology, and\nnot the philosophy of science, to target first of all the impact of\ntechnology\u2014and with it science\u2014on society and culture,\nbecause science affects society only through being applied as\ntechnology. This, however, will not do. Right from the start of the\nscientific revolution, science affected human culture and thought\nfundamentally and directly, not with a detour through technology, and\nthe same is true for later developments such as relativity, atomic\nphysics and quantum mechanics, the theory of evolution, genetics,\nbiochemistry, and the increasingly dominating scientific world view\noverall. All the same philosophers of science for a long time gave the\nimpression that they left questions addressing the normative, social\nand cultural aspects of science gladly to other philosophical\ndisciplines, or to historical studies. This has changed only during\nthe past few decades, by scholars either focusing on these issues from\nthe start (e.g. Longino 1990, 2002) or shifting their focus toward\nthem (e.g. Kitcher 2001, 2011).\n\nThere is a major difference between the historical development of\nmodern technology as compared to modern science which may at least\npartly explain this situation, which is that science emerged in the\nseventeenth century from philosophy itself. The answers that Galileo,\nHuygens, Newton, and others gave, by which they initiated the alliance\nof empiricism and mathematical description that is so characteristic\nof modern science, were answers to questions that had belonged to the\ncore business of philosophy since antiquity. Science, therefore, kept\nthe attention of philosophers. Philosophy of science can be seen as a\ntransformation of epistemology in the light of the emergence of\nscience. The foundational issues\u2014the reality of atoms, the\nstatus of causality and probability, questions of space and time, the\nnature of the quantum world\u2014that were so lively discussed during\nthe end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century\nare an illustration of this close relationship between scientists and\nphilosophers. No such intimacy has ever existed between philosophers\nand engineers or technologists. Their worlds still barely touch. To be\nsure, a case can be made that, compared to the continuity existing\nbetween natural philosophy and science, a similar continuity exists\nbetween central questions in philosophy having to do with human action\nand practical rationality and the way technology approaches and\nsystematizes the solution of practical problems. To investigate this\nconnection may indeed be considered a major theme for philosophy of\ntechnology, and more is said on it in Sections\n 2.3\n and\n 2.4.\n This continuity appears only by hindsight, however, and dimly, as the\nhistorical development is at most a slow convening of various strands\nof philosophical thinking on action and rationality, not a development\ninto variety from a single origin. Significantly it is only the\nacademic outsider Ellul who has, in his idiosyncratic way, recognized\nin technology the emergent single dominant way of answering all\nquestions concerning human action, comparable to science as the single\ndominant way of answering all questions concerning human knowledge\n(Ellul 1954 [1964]). But Ellul was not so much interested in\ninvestigating this relationship as in emphasizing and denouncing the\nsocial and cultural consequences as he saw them. It is all the more\nimportant to point out that humanities philosophy of technology cannot\nbe differentiated from analytic philosophy of technology by claiming\nthat only the former is interested in the social context of\ntechnology. There are studies which are rooted in analytic philosophy\nof science but address in particular the relation of technology to\nsociety and culture, and equally the relevance of social relations to\ntechnological practices, without taking an evaluative stand with\nrespect to technology; an example is Preston 2012.\n",
