Overview of Maimonides\u2019 Islamic Philosophical Backdrop: Theology of Aristotle and Beyond\n\n\nOne of the most important sources to keep in mind when reading\nMaimonides and Islamic medieval philosophers is the Theology of\nAristotle, a text that, while thought by Jewish and Islamic\nphilosophers to have been a work of Aristotle, was in fact an edited\nsummary of parts of books 4-6 of\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads.[3]\n Likely dated to the 9th century and edited\nby al-Kindi (and/or members of his circle), this text\u2014as well as\nthe rest of the Plotiniana Arabica and the Kal\u00e2m\nf\u00ee mahd al-khair (lit. the Discourse on the Pure\nGood, known to some in its later Latin translation as the Liber\nde Causis, or Book of\n Causes)[4]\u2014should\n be read in connection with any\nserious study of Maimonides.  In way of summary, we might highlight\nthe following key ideas in the Theology of Aristotle that play\nimportant roles for later Jewish and Islamic thinkers:\n\nGod is a pure unity who is pure goodness and pure being\nGod is creator, first cause of all beings\nGod emanates forth Intellect, then Soul, then Nature\n\n\n\nHere, we have a uniquely modified set of Plotinian insights that\nfeature prominently in Maimonidean thought. For Plotinus (following\nPlato\u2019s own highlighting of a Form of the Good over and above the Form\nof Being), God is himself a pure One identical to goodness per se, and\nis as such entirely above and beyond intellect and even entirely above\nand beyond being. In the Theology of Aristotle tradition God is\nidentified with pure unity and goodness, but is as such also\nidentified with a pure grade of being. And while the Theology of\nAristotle itself describes God as the maker of Intellect, as we\nmove into the reception of this tradition into al-Farabi and Avicenna,\nwe find that qua pure being and goodness God is also a pure\nintellect\u2014a point which adds a decidedly Aristotelian element to\nthe description of God. Thinkers such as Maimonides working within\nthe Theology of Aristotle and Aristotle traditions in this way\ncombine Plotinian and Aristotelian insights about God, mutually\nhighlighting the Plotinian sense of God as pure unity and the\nAristotelian sense of God as self-knowing intellect. Working within\nthis set of parameters, Maimonides and others are also helped to a\nsense of God as the ultimate cause of all being (and not simply a\npicture of God as a cause of motion, as one finds in Aristotle\nproper).\n\n\nThe Theology of Aristotle also introduces two critical insights\nabout creation which one finds too in al-Farabi and Avicenna:\n\nCreation is emanation\nGod creates/emanates in virtue of His onwmost essential goodness\n\n\n\nIn whatever way one winds up interpreting Maimonides\u2019 own view on\ncreation, it is important to bear in mind that he is writing in a\nphilosophical context in which there is plenty of strong precedent for\nidentifying the language of \u201ccreation\u201d (and even\n\u201ccreation ex nihilo\u201d) with the idea that God\neternally emanates forth in virtue of his ownmost essence as the pure\ngood (a point itself rooted in Plotinus in the idea of an\n\u201cunjealous\u201d God in Plato\u2019s Timaeus). It might be\nadditionally noted that in the Theology of Aristotle, this\nbountiful picture of God\u2014linked in a range of medieval Islamic\ntexts to the idea of God\u2019s generosity\u2014is also overtly linked to\nthe idea that God creates without thought or deliberation. While in\nand of itself (in another theological context) this might sound like\nan insulting way to describe God (i.e. \u201cthoughtless\u201d), in\nthe context at hand, it is part of the most honored and exalted way of\ndescribing God, emphasizing in particular just how essentially\ncreation flows from God\u2019s bountiful goodness. For God to deliberate\nabout creation in this context would be to make of creation an\nafterthought when, on the contrary, giving life to the world is here\nhighlighted as part and parcel of who God essentially is. We can find\nthis idea of \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d in a sense in even\nAvicenna\u2019s more Aristotelian description of God as an Intellect: even\nqua Intellect, Avicenna\u2019s God creates \u201cin virtue of His very\nessence,\u201d and not by a process of reasoning as we might\nunderstand it in human contexts.\n\n\nReflecting on our other sources, we ought to keep some starting points\nin mind:\n\n(a) Regarding al-Farabi: In what follows we will focus more on\nal-Farabi than on Avicenna and Averroes since al-Farabi is a thinker\nfor whom Maimonides expresses strong respect (citing him in the Guide\nmore than any other Islamic thinker; Rudavsky 2010, 7), but also\nbecause al-Farabi, as the earliest of these thinkers, exerted\ninfluence on many of the ideas in Avicenna, Averroes, and other\nIslamic philosophers.\n\n\n(b) Regarding Avicenna: While Avicennian notions can arguably be found\nin Maimonides, his view of the thinker is complicated. In a letter to\nIbn Tibbon, Maimonides clearly states that Avicenna's philosophy is of\nlesser value than al-Farabi's. That said, even in that context\nMaimonides characterizes Avicenna\u2019s ideas as subtle and exacting, and\nas worthy of study.[5]\n\n\n(c) Regarding Averroes: While we know that Maimonides held a great\nrespect for the writings of \n Averroes,[6]\n Pines and Ivry maintain that these writings\nwere most likely unknown to Maimonides until after the completion of\nhis Guide (Pines 1963, cviii). In contrast, W. Z. Harvey has explored\nthe resonance of Averroes in Guide 2.25 (W. Z. Harvey 1989), and\nStroumsa\u2014arguing that Maimonides had access to\nAverroes\u2019 Decisive Treatise and Exposition\u2014goes so\nfar as to suggest that \u201c\u2026the Guide can in some ways be seen as a\nreaction and answer to Averroes\u201d (Stroumsa 2009, 73). \n\n\n(d) Regarding al-Ghazali: While Pines concludes that Maimonides must\nhave been aware of al-Ghazali\u2019s work just in virtue of his\nintellectual context (e.g. Pines 1963, cxxvi-cxxxi), others go further\nand highlight particular textual resonances of al-Ghazali in\nMaimonides. While leaving open how Maimondies might have learned of\nGhazali\u2019s ideas, Davidson addresses al-Ghazali in Maimonides\u2019\ndiscussion of creation (Davidson 1979, esp. 28, 30, and 33), and also\ncites Maimonides\u2019 use of a particular image in al-Ghazali of a youth\nwho prefers toys to sexual pleasures in his attempt to describe our\nown inability as embodied humans to imagine the delights of the\nspiritual world,[7]\n S. Harvey argues for a link between\nMaimonides and Ghazali\u2019s respective \u201cBook(s) of Knowledge\u201d\n(Harvey 2005), Eran explores Ghazali and Maimonides on the World to\nCome (Eran 2001), Gil\u2018adi considers the possible relation between the\ntitle of Maimonides\u2019 magnum opus and al-Ghazali\u2019s description of God\nas \u201cguide of perplexed\u201d (dal\u012bl al-muta\u1e25ayyir\u012bn)\n(Gil'adi 1979), and Stroumsa not only identifies a reference to one of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s works in Maimonides\u2019 \u201cEpistle to Yemen\u201d\n(Stroumsa 2009, 25-26), but argues more broadly (69-70) for the impact\nof al-Ghazali on Maimonides through the influence of the Islamic\ntheologian/mystic on the Almohads under whose rulership Maimonides\nlived, and many of whose theological and legal principles, Stroumsa\nargues, were influential on Maimonides\u2019 thought. Stroumsa also argues\nthat if Maimonides knew Averroes\u2019 Fa\u1e63l al-maq\u0101l (as\nshe thinks he did), then \u201cit is also very likely that he was\nfamiliar with Ghazali\u2019s Fay\u1e63al al-tafriqa\u201d\n(Stroumsa 2009, 124).\n",
