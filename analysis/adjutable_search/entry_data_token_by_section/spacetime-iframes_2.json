If force is defined and\nmeasured solely by the power to accelerate a body, then obviously the\neffects of forces\u2014in short, the causal interactions within a\nsystem of bodies\u2014will be independent of the velocity of the\nsystem in which they are measured. So the existence of a set of\nequivalent \u201cinertial frames\u201d is imposed from the start by\nNewton\u2019s laws. Suppose that we determine for the bodies in a\ngiven frame of reference\u2014say, the rest frame of the fixed\nstars\u2014that all observable accelerations are proportional to\nforces impressed by bodies within the system, by equal and opposite\nactions and reactions among those bodies. Then we know that these\nphysical interactions will be the same in any frame of reference that\nis in uniform rectilinear motion relative to the first one. Therefore\nno Newtonian experiment will be able to determine the velocity of a\nbody, or system of bodies, relative to absolute space. In other words,\nthere is no way to distinguish absolute space itself from any frame of\nreference that is in uniform motion relative to it. Newton thought\nthat a coherent account of force and motion requires a background\nspace consisting of \u201cplaces\u201d that \u201cfrom infinity to\ninfinity maintain given positions with respect to one another\u201d\n(1687b, p. 8\u20139). But the laws of motion enable us to determine\nan infinity of such spaces, all in uniform rectilinear motion relative\nto each other. The laws furnish no way of singling out any one as\n\u201cimmovable space.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, no one in the 17th century, or even before\nthe late 19th century, expressed this equivalence of\nreference-frames any more clearly than Newton himself. However, the\ncredit for articulating this equivalence precisely for the first time,\nbelongs to Christiaan Huygens, who introduced it as one of the\nHypotheses of his first work on the rules of impact (1656).\n\u201cHypothesis I\u201d was the first clear statement of the\nprinciple of inertia: \u201cAny body, once in motion, if nothing\nopposes it, continues to move always with the same velocity and along\nthe same straight line\u201d (1656, pp. 30\u201331). The first\nprecise statement of the relativity principle followed as Hypothesis\nIII: \n\nThe motion of bodies, and their speeds equal or unequal, are to be\nunderstood respectively, in relation to other bodies which are\nconsidered as at rest, even though perhaps both the former and the\nlatter are subject to another motion that is common to them. In\nconsequence, when two bodies collide with one another, even if both\ntogether undergo another equable motion, they will move each other no\ndifferently, with respect to a body that is carried by the same common\nmotion, than if this extraneous motion were absent from all of them.\n(1656, p. 32).\n\n\nHuygens illustrated this principle by the example of an impact that\ntakes place on a uniformly moving boat, asserting its equivalence to\nthe same impact taking place at rest. Thus he made precise the\nargument of Galileo, in light of his more precise understanding of the\nprinciple of inertia and the dynamical difference between inertial and\ncircular motion.\n\nNewton\u2019s first statement of the same principle appears in one of\nthe series of papers that culminated in the Principia,\n\u201cDe motu sph\u00e6ricorum corporum in fluidis\u201d (1684b).\nLike Huygens, Newton presents the relativity principle as a\nfundamental principle, \u201cLaw 3\u201d: \n\nThe motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among\nthemselves whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly in a\nstraight line without circular motion. (1684b, p. 40r)\n\n\nNewton\u2019s first statement of the Galilean relativity principle\nevidently recapitulates Huygens\u2019 version, which was probably\nknown to Newton. The same may be said of \u201cLaw 4\u201d in this\nmanuscript, the principle of conservation of the center of gravity:\n\n\nBy the mutual actions between bodies their common centre of gravity\ndoes not change its state of motion or rest. (ibid., p. 40r)\n\n\nBut, uniquely, Newton immediately went on to consider the deeper\ntheoretical significance of these principles: they radically\nreconceptualize the problem of \u201ctrue motion\u201d in the\nplanetary system. First, they implied that the entire system must be\nseen as included in a space that may, itself, be either at rest or in\nuniform motion. Second, they implied that the only truly fixed point\nin such a system is the center of gravity of the relevant bodies.\nThis, too, may therefore be in uniform motion or at rest:\n\nMoreover the whole space of the planetary heavens either rests (as is\ncommonly believed) or moves uniformly in a straight line, and hence\nthe communal centre of gravity of the planets (by Law 4) either rests\nor moves along with it. In both cases (by Law 3) the relative motions\nof the planets are the same, and their common centre of gravity rests\nin relation to the whole space, and so can certainly be taken for the\nstill centre of the whole planetary system. (ibid., p. 47r)\n\n\nNewton now realized, in short, that the dispute between the\nheliocentric and geocentric views of the universe had been mistakenly\nframed. The proper question about \u201cthe system of the\nworld\u201d was not \u201cwhich body is at rest in the\ncenter?\u201d but \u201cwhere is the center of gravity of the\nsystem, and which body is closest to it?\u201d For in a system of\norbiting bodies, only their common center of gravity will be\nunaccelerated, and by \u201cLaw 3\u201d, the motions of the bodies\nin the system will be the same, whether its center of gravity is at\nrest or in uniform rectilinear motion. By explicitly asserting the\ndynamical equivalence of \u201cwhole spaces\u201d that may moving\nuniformly or at rest, Newton made it clear that the solution to the\nproblem of \u201cthe system of the world\u201d is the same with\nrespect to any such moving space as it is with respect to immobile\nspace. Thus he came as close to articulating the concept of the\ninertial frame as anyone before the late 19th century.\n\nIn the successive drafts of his Principia, Newton gradually\nclarified its conceptual structure, and in particular the\nframe-independent character of its concepts of motion, force, and\ninteraction. He arrived at the new axiomatic structure whose only laws\nare the familiar \u201cNewton\u2019s Laws of Motion\u201d; the\nprinciple of the conservation of the center of gravity, and the\nrelativity principle, were no longer presupposed, but derived from the\nLaws as Corollaries IV and V:\n\nCorollary IV: The common center of gravity of bodies does not change\nits state, whether of motion or rest, by the actions of those bodies\namong themselves; therefore the common centre of gravity of all bodies\n(external impediments excluded) rests or moves uniformly in a straight\nline (1687b, p. 17).\n\n\nCorollary V: When bodies are enclosed in a given space, their motions\namong themselves are the same whether the space is at rest, or whether\nit is moving uniformly straight forward without circular motion\n(1687b, p. 19).\n\n\nThese principles illuminate the relationship between the theory of\nabsolute space, as articulated in Newton\u2019s Scholium to the\nDefinitions, and the overarching scientific problem of the\nPrincipia. According to Newton, \u201cthe aim for which I\ncomposed\u201d the book was to show \u201chow to gather the true\nmotions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences, and\nconversely, from the motions, true or apparent, to gather their causes\nand effects\u201d (1687b, p. 11); the more specific aim of Book III\nwas \u201cto exhibit the constitution of the system of the\nworld\u201d (1687b, p. 401). \n\nOn the one hand, Corollary V, like \u201cLaw 3\u201d in De Motu,\nprecisely restricts what Newton\u2019s procedure can determine about\nthe structure of the system of the world. It cannot determine anything\nabout the velocity of the system as a whole; it can only determine the\nposition of the center of gravity of the bodies that comprise it, and\nthe configuration of those bodies with respect to that center. In this\nsense it can, in principle, decide between a Keplerian and a Tychonic\ninterpretation of the motions of these bodies. The system is indeed\napproximately Keplerian: the sun has by far the greatest mass and is\ntherefore little disturbed from the center of gravity by its\ninteractions with the planets. The sun therefore remains very close to\nthe common focus of the nearly Keplerian ellipses in which the planets\norbit the sun. But by Corollary V, the actions of the bodies among\nthemselves would not reveal whether their center was moving uniformly\nor at rest. On the other hand, Newton recognized that motion with\nrespect to absolute space is unknowable. This restriction, therefore,\nmeant that the solution to the system of the world is secure in spite\nof our ignorance. The nearly-Keplerian structure of the system is\nknown completely independently of the system\u2019s state of motion\nin absolute space.\n\nThe Galilean relativity principle thus contained, in Newton\u2019s\nconception, a broader insight: that different states of uniform\nmotion, or different uniformly-moving frames of reference, determine\nonly different points of view on the same physically objective\nquantities, namely force, mass, and acceleration. We can see this\ninsight expressed more explicitly in the evolution of Newton\u2019s\nconcept of inertia. The term had been introduced by Kepler, and played\na central role in his physical conception of planetary motion.\nRejecting the Aristotelian idea that the planets are carried by\nrotating crystalline spheres, Kepler held that the planets have a\nnatural tendency to rest in space\u2014what he called their natural\ninertia\u2014and argued that they must be moved by active powers that\novercome their natural inertia. Newton, well before working on\nPrincipia, had based his conception of inertia on the idea of\nGalileo and Huygens, that bodies tend to persist in uniform motion:\nInertia, on this new conception, was a resistance to change in motion.\nEven so, Newton\u2019s early understanding of inertia was essentially\npre-relativistic, because it implied a conceptual distinction between\na body\u2019s power to resist external forces, and the power of a\nmoving body to change the motion of another. The manuscript De\ngravitatione et aequipondio fluidorum (1684a), for example, was\nevidently written before Newton fully recognized the importance of the\nrelativity principle; here Newton\u2019s Definitions distinguish\n\u201cconatus,\u201d \u201cimpetus,\u201d and\n\u201cinertia\u201d as conceptually separate properties:\n\nDefinition 6: Conatus (endeavor) is impeded force, or force in so far\nas it is resisted.\n\n\nDefinition 7: Impetus is force in so far as it is impressed on\nanother.\n\n\nDefinition 8: Inertia is the internal force of a body, so that its\nstate may not be easily changed by an external force (1684a).\n\n\nLeibniz (among others), as we saw, made a corresponding distinction:\nmoving force, the power of a body to change the motion of another, was\ndetermined by velocity. Leibniz therefore distinguished this force as\nan active power, fundamentally different from the passive power of a\nresting body to resist any change of position. Newton, in contrast, as\nhe developed the Principia, and recognized the existence of a\nclass of indistinguishable relative spaces, gradually came to\nunderstand the \u201cforce of inertia\u201d as what we would call a\nGalilei-invariant quantity. Impetus and resistance were therefore\nrecognized as appearances of that invariant quantity in different\nframes of reference:\n\nA body truly exerts this force only in a change of its state brought\nabout by another force impressed upon it, and the exercise of this\nforce is, under different aspects, both resistance and impetus:\nresistance in so far as the body, to maintain its state, opposes the\nimpressed force; impetus insofar as the same body, yielding only with\ndifficulty to the force of a resisting obstacle, strives to change the\nstate of that obstacle. Resistance is commonly attributed to resting\nbodies and impetus to moving bodies; but motion and rest, as commonly\nunderstood, are only relatively distinguished from each other; and\nbodies commonly seen as resting are not always truly at rest (1687b,\np. 2).\n\n\nThere are two noteworthy points about this explication of inertia.\nFirst, it shows that Newton recognized properties that were commonly\nregarded as distinct (e.g. in the Leibnizian distinction between\npassive and active) as merely frame-dependent representations of the\nsame fundamental property. That is, they represent the same invariant\nquantity seen from different points of view. The principle that a body\nexerts this force \u201conly in a change of its state\u201d\ndecisively separates Newton\u2019s new view from the older notion of\na specific power that is required to maintain a body in motion. This\nchange has been noted by modern commentators (see Herivel 1965, p. 26;\nsee also DiSalle 2013, p. 453; Disalle 2017, in Other Internet\nResources). But it was already noted in Newton\u2019s own time by\nGeorge Berkeley, who emphasized the contrast between Newton\u2019s\nconception and that of Leibniz:\n\nLeibniz confuses impetus with motion. According to Newton, impetus is\nin truth the same as the force of inertia\u2026 (Berkeley 1721\n[1992], p.  79)\n\n\n\u2026it is established by experience that it is a primary law of\nnature that a body persists \u201cin a state of motion or of rest as\nlong as nothing happens from elsewhere to change that state,\u201d\nand therefore it is inferred that the force of inertia is under\ndifferent aspects either resistance or impetus, in this sense a\nbody can indeed be said to be by nature indifferent to motion and\nrest. (Berkeley, 1721 [1992], p.  96)\n\n\nBerkeley thus made clear that the older understanding of inertia,\nunlike that expressed in the Principia, did not respect the\nprinciple of relativity. Second, Newton\u2019s explication implicitly\ninvokes all three laws of motion (cf. Stein 2002). Newton\u2019s\nfirst law alone came to be identified as \u201cthe principle of\ninertia.\u201d Newton himself, however, understood that inertia has\nthree inseparable aspects: the tendency to persist in motion, the\nresistance to change in motion, and the power to react against an\nimpressed force. All are essential to the explication of inertial mass\nas a measurable theoretical quantity. To many later commentators,\nNewton\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cforce of inertia\u201d\nsuggested a conceptual confusion. On the contrary, it was\nNewton\u2019s way of drawing attention to the precise role of\ninertial mass as an invariant quantity in physical interactions,\nunderlying the various ways in which its manifestations had been\npreviously conceived.\n",
