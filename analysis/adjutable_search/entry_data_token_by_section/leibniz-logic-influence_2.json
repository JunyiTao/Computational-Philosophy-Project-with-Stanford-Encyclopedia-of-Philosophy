    "main_text": "Second Wave of Reception\n3. Second Wave of Reception\n\n\nWhen access to Leibniz\u2019s papers stored in Hanover became\npossible in the 1830s, interest in Leibniz arose almost immediately. It can be said\nthat German research on Leibniz started as an aftermath of this event\n(Glockner 1932, 60). The pioneers in this period of research were the\nfirst editors of these papers. Although the philological interest stood\nat the center, one could also observe an emerging interest in systematic aspects of\nLeibniz\u2019s logic. The following editorial milestones have to be\nmentioned: Gottschalk Eduard Guhrauer (1809\u20131854) edited the\nDeutsche Schriften (Leibniz 1838/40); Georg Heinrich Pertz\n(1795\u20131876) directed the edition of the collected works, of which\na first series was devoted to the mathematical writings (Leibniz\n1849\u20131863). The latter were edited by Carl Immanuel Gerhardt\n(1816\u20131899). In addition, Pertz also edited Leibniz\u2019s\nAnnales imperii occidentis Brunsvicenses (Leibniz\n1843\u20131846).\n",
