    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nHolism has often been taken as the thesis that the whole is more than\nthe sum of its parts. Several different interpretations of this\nepigram prove relevant to physics, as we shall see. Here is a\ncorrespondingly vague initial statement of nonseparability: The state\nof the whole is not constituted by states of its parts. It is already\napparent both that holism and nonseparability are related notions and\nthat their exact relation needs to be clarified.\n\nIn one interpretation, holism is a methodological thesis\n (Section 2),\n to the effect that the best way to study the behavior of a complex\nsystem is to treat it as a whole, and not merely to analyze the\nstructure and behavior of its component parts. Alternatively, holism\nmay be taken as a metaphysical thesis\n (Section 3):\n There are some wholes whose natures are simply not determined by the\nnature of their parts. Methodological holism stands opposed to\nmethodological reductionism, in physics as well as in other sciences.\nBut it is a certain variety of metaphysical holism that is more\nclosely related to nonseparability. What is at issue here is the\nextent to which the properties of the whole are determined by the\nproperties of its parts: property holism\n (Section 4)\n denies such determination, and thereby comes very close to a thesis\nof nonseparability. In turn, nonseparability can be analyzed either as\nstate nonseparability\n (Section 5),\n or as spatiotemporal nonseparability\n (Section 6).\n By and large, a system in classical physics can be analyzed into\nparts, whose states and properties determine those of the whole they\ncompose\n (Section 7).\n But all hands agree that the state of a system in quantum theory\nresists such analysis. The quantum state of a system specifies its\nchances of exhibiting various properties on measurement. In ordinary\nquantum mechanics, the most complete such specification is given by\nwhat is called a pure state. Even when a compound system has a pure\nstate, some of its subsystems may not have their own pure states.\nEmphasizing this characteristic of quantum mechanics, Schr\u00f6dinger\ndescribed such component states as \u201centangled\u201d\n (Section 8).\n Superficially, such entanglement of states already demonstrates\nnonseparability. At a deeper level, it has been maintained that the\npuzzling statistics that arise from measurements on entangled quantum\nsystems either demonstrate, or are explicable in terms of, holism or\nnonseparability rather than any problematic action at a distance\n (Sections 8,\n 9). The Aharonov-Bohm effect\n (Section 10)\n also appears to exhibit action at a distance, as the behavior of\nelectrons is modified by a magnetic field they never experience. But\nthis effect may be understood instead as a result of the local action\nof nonseparable electromagnetism. And indeed, this type of holism is\nnot rooted in quantum mechanics or entanglement: though the\nmeasurement of the Aharonov-Bohm effect uses quantum ingredients, it\nbuilds on the existence of non-separable quantities in classical gauge\ntheory (e.g. electromagnetism) in a vacuum. But even focussing on\ntheories without gauge symmetry, we can obtain puzzling correlations\nbetween distant simultaneous measurements in the vacuum, according to\nquantum field theory\n (Section 12).\n A form of quantum theory used to study them represents systems by\nalgebras of operators with new kinds of states defined on them,\nthereby making room for failures of state and system separability with\nno analogs in ordinary quantum mechanics. String theory\n (Section 13)\n is an ambitious research program in the framework of quantum field\ntheory. According to string theory, all fundamental particles can be\nconsidered to be excitations of underlying non-pointlike entities in a\nmulti-dimensional space. The particles\u2019 intrinsic charge, mass\nand spin may then arise as nonseparable features of the world at the\ndeepest level.\n",
