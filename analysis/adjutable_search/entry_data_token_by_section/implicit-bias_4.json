    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Implicit Processes\n2.2 Implicit Processes\n\n\nInfluenced by dual process theories of mind, RIM\n(\u201cReflective-Impulsive Model\u201d; Strack & Deutsche 2004)\nand APE (\u201cAssociative-Propositional Evaluation\u201d; Gawronski\n& Bodenhausen 2006, 2011) suggest that implicit measures assess\ndistinctive cognitive processes. The central distinction at the heart\nof both RIM and APE is between \u201cassociative\u201d and\n\u201cpropositional\u201d processes. Associative processes are said\nto underlie an impulsive system that functions according to classic\nassociationist principles of similarity and contiguity. Implicit\nmeasures are thought of as assessing the momentary accessibility of\nelements or nodes of a network of associations. This network produces\nspontaneous evaluative responses to stimuli. Propositional processes,\non the other hand, underlie a reflective system that validates the\ninformation provided by activated associations. Explicit measures are\nthought to capture this process of validation, which is said to operate\naccording to agents\u2019 syllogistic reasoning and judgments of\nlogical consistency. In sum, the key distinction between associative\nand propositional processes according to RIM and APE is that\npropositional processing alone depends on an agent\u2019s assessment\nof the truth of a given\n representation.[8]\nAPE in particular aims to explain the interactions\nbetween and mutual influences of associative and propositional\nprocesses in judgment and behavior.\n\n\nRIM and APE bear resemblance to the dual attitudes theories in\nphilosophy discussed above. Indeed, Bodenhausen & Gawronski (2014:\n957) write that the \u201cdistinction between associative and\npropositional evaluations is analogous to the distinction between\n\u2018alief\u2019 and belief in recent philosophy of\nepistemology.\u201d It is important to keep in mind, however, that RIM\nand APE are not attitudinal theories. APE, for example, posits two\ndistinct kinds of process\u2014associative and propositional\nprocesses\u2014that give rise to two kinds of evaluative responses to\nstimuli\u2014implicit and explicit. It does not posit the existence of\ntwo distinct attitudes or two distinct co-existing representations of\nthe same entity. It is also important to note that the distinction\nbetween associative and propositional processes can be understood in at\nleast three distinct senses: as applying to the way in which\ninformation is learned, stored, or expressed (Gawronski et al. 2017).\nAt present, evidence is mixed for dissociation between associative and\npropositional processing in the learning and storage of information,\nwhile it is stronger for dissociation in the behavioral expression of\nstored information (Brownstein et al. 2019). \n",
