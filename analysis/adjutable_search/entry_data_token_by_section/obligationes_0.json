Obligationes as a branch of logic\n\nAs a branch of logic, obligations came to flourish with European\nmedieval logic from the thirteenth century onwards, and they slowly\nvanished when logic as a discipline, a.k.a. \u2018scholastic\nlogic\u2019 retreated in the early modern times. During the peak\nperiod in the fourteenth century, many or perhaps even most European\nlogicians wrote a dedicated text on obligations (de\nobligationibus). These texts were either stand-alone treatises or\nsections in overall presentations of logic. Of the former kind,\ntreatises by Walter Burley (\u201cTreatise on Obligations\u201d,\nwritten c. 1302; Latin text in Green [1963], English translation in\nKretzmann and Stump [1988]), Roger Swyneshed (written 1330\u201335;\nSpade [1977]) and Robert\n Eland[1]\n (written 1335\u20131370; Spade [1980]) have been particularly\nimportant in shaping the modern understanding of the topic. Of the\nlatter kind, for example William Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae\n(written c. 1323; Boehner, G\u00e1l, & Brown [1974]) and Paul of\nVenice\u2019s Logica magna (written 1397\u201398; Ashworth\n[1988]) can be mentioned as outstanding examples.\n\nThe technique of obligations assumes a dialectical setting or even\nsomething like a game between two persons. This setting is usually\nvery succinctly described in the texts themselves. In a nutshell, what\nhappens in an obligational disputation is that one person, the\nopponent, is putting forward propositions\n (propositiones)[2]\n and another person, the respondent, is expected to give direct\nevaluations of these propositions as they come. There are two main\nanswers, granting the proposition or denying it. Only rarely, the\ntexts allow other answers like doubting the proposition (see e.g.,\nUckelman, Maat and Rybalko 2018). The sequence of propositions put\nforward and answered is taken to be a temporal sequence, but most\nauthors thought that the truth values of the propositions are not to\nbe taken to change during the disputation.\n\nThe sequence of propositions evaluated this way is launched by the\nopponent giving the respondent a specified obligation, in the paradigm\ncase that of granting an obviously false proposition. This specified\nobligation must be respected throughout the sequence, regardless of\nhow complex the sequence gets. The underlying idea is that although\nthe specified obligation relieves the respondent from always following\ntruth in the evaluations, the requirement of some kind of logical\ncoherence is not suspended.\n\nThese special obligations come in different varieties. Most medieval\ntreatments of the branch of logic are divided by discussions of\ndifferent varieties. The most common is called\n\u2018positio\u2019, or \u2018laying down\u2019. In\n\u2018positio\u2019 a false proposition is laid down at the\nbeginning of the disputation, and the respondent remains obligated to\ngrant it whenever the opponent puts it forward. Modern attention has\nbeen mainly on positio. (On \u2018sit verum\u2019,\nsee Spade 1994\u201397 and Uckelman 2015.)\n\nWalter Burley, for example, discusses six kinds of obligations (Green\n1963, Kretzmann and Stump 1988):\n\n(1)\n\u2018Positio\u2019, where a specified proposition\nneeds to be always granted.\n(2)\n\u2018Depositio\u2019 where a specified proposition\nneeds to be always denied.\n(3)\n\u2018Dubitatio\u2019, where a specified proposition\nneeds to be always doubted.\n(4)\n\u2018Institutio\u2019 or\n\u2018impositio\u2019 where a new meaning is given to some\nlinguistic item.\n(5)\n\u2018Sit verum\u2019, where a specified proposition is\nto be taken as true.\n(6)\n\u2018Petitio\u2019, where some other requirement is\nput on the respondent.\n\n\nOf these kinds only (1), (2), and (4) are commonly addressed in later\ndiscussions of the genre, but all of them can be found in texts other\nthan Burley\u2019s treatise. However, for a general understanding of\nthe technique it does not seem necessary to account for varieties\nother than \u2018positio\u2019.\n\nAlmost all the medieval dedicated treatments of obligations proceed\nthrough giving rules on how the respondent ought to give the\nevaluations, or what is to be granted and what is to be denied. The\nessential rules are based on the idea that each proposition put\nforward must be recognized as \u2018relevant\u2019 or\n\u2018irrelevant\u2019 in relation to the obligation given at the\nbeginning. Thus, if the respondent is given as a\n\u2018positio\u2019 the proposition \u2018Plato is\nrunning\u2019, the proposition \u2018Plato is moving\u2019, and\nindeed any proposition following from \u2018Plato is running\u2019\nis to be deemed sequentially relevant. Similarly, any proposition\nincompatible with \u2018Plato is running\u2019 is to be deemed\nincompatibly relevant: \u2018Plato is sitting\u2019 will have to be\ndenied. On the other hand, \u2018Socrates is running\u2019 is to be\ndeemed irrelevant at least if it is put forward immediately after the\n\u2018positio\u2019, since there is no logical connection\nbetween Plato and Socrates running.\n\nThe core two rules of \u2018positio\u2019 require the\nrespondent to grant any sequentially relevant proposition, and to deny\nany incompatibly relevant proposition. These two rules are accepted by\nall authors, but under different interpretations. Since obligational\ndisputations are technically constituted by sequences of propositions\nwith their respective responses, what is relevant and what is not at a\nparticular step need not be determined solely by the\n\u2018positio\u2019. Also, within the context of\nobligations, it cannot be taken as univocally given how\n\u2018follows\u2019 (sequitur), or the logical consequence\nrelation, is to be understood.\n\nThe core terminology of obligations centers around \u2018has to be\ngranted\u2019 (est concedendum) and \u2018has to be\ndenied\u2019 (est negandum). These expressions were widely\nused in medieval European academic texts even outside logic, but\nnormally with the implication that things that have to be granted are\ntrue, and vice versa, what is true must be granted. In obligations\ntreatises, both the connection and the contrast of these expressions\nto truth is of special importance. What is true and what has to be\ngranted are often not the same thing, because propositions are granted\nas following from the false positio, or on the basis of some\nother special obligation. That the terms \u2018has to be\ngranted\u2019 and \u2018has to be denied\u2019 are used in general\nacademic contexts outside obligations can presumably be attributed to\nthe fact that medieval academia predominantly thought about arguments\nin a dialectical context. Obligations as such would not always be at\nissue when such terms are used. But it does seem that at least in the\nfourteenth century, obligations as a branch of logic was taken to\naddress core aspects of what it means when something has to be granted\nin an argumentative setting.\n\nThe medieval logical genre of sophismata (see the entry on\n sophismata\n in this encyclopedia) appears especially relevant to obligations. A\ntypical sophism in this sense consists of a case (casus), a\nsophisma sentence, arguments for and against the sophisma sentence\nbased on the case, and a solution. The case is often imagined rather\nthan real or even genuinely possible. One relatively natural way to\nthink of a sophism would thus be to take the case (casus) as\na positio in the sense of obligational disputations. Indeed,\nRichard Kilvington\u2019s comments of the obligational rules in his\nSophismata show him thinking that obligational rules regulate\nhow one ought to evaluate sentences on the basis of the case\n(casus) in a sophisma.
