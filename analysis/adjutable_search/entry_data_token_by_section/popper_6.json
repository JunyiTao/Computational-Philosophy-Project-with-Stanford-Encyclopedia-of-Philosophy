    "main_text": "Objective Knowledge and The Three Worlds Ontology\n7. Objective Knowledge and The Three Worlds Ontology\n\nPopper\u2019s hostility to psychologistic approaches to epistemology\nis evident from his earliest works. Questions relating to the origins\nof convictions, feelings of certainty and the like, he argues, are\nproperly considered the province of psychology; their attempted use in\nepistemology, which has been characteristic in particular of some\nschools of empiricism, can lead only to confusion and ultimately to\nscepticism. Against it, he repeatedly insists on the objectivity of\nscientific knowledge and sees it as the principal task of epistemology\nto engage with the questions of justification and validity in that\nconnection (2002: 7).\n\nIn some of his later works in the field, particularly his\n\u201cEpistemology Without a Knowing Subject\u201d (1967,\nrepublished in Objective Knowledge [1972]) and in his lecture\n\u201cThree Worlds\u201d in the Tanner Lectures on Human Values\ndelivered in 1978 (published 1980), Popper develops the notion of\nobjectivity further in a novel but controversial way by seeking to\nfree it completely from all psychological constraints. What is central\nto epistemology, he reaffirms, is the concept of objectivity, which he\nseeks to show requires neither the notions of subjective mental states\nnor even that of a subject \u201cpossessing\u201d knowledge:\nknowledge in its full objective sense, he argues, is knowledge\n\u201cwithout a knowing subject\u201d.\n\nPopper\u2019s angle of approach here is to situate the development of\nknowledge in the context of animal and human evolution. It is\ncharacteristic of evolutionary processes, he points out, that they\ncome to take place in an environment which is itself in part fashioned\nby the species in question. Examples of this abound, such as the reefs\nbuilt by corals, the hives built by bees, the dams built by beavers\nand the atmospheric effects yielded by plants. This, Popper contends,\nis also true of human beings: we too have created new kinds of\nproducts, \u201cintellectual products\u201d, which shape our\nenvironment. These are our myths, our ideas, our art works and our\nscientific theories about the world in which we live. When placed in\nan evolutionary context, he suggests, such products must be viewed\ninstrumentally, as exosomatic artefacts. Chief amongst them is\nknowledge\n\n\nin the objective or impersonal sense, in which it may be said to be\ncontained in a book; or stored in a library; or taught in a\nuniversity. (1979: 286)\n\n\nOn this view, termed \u201cevolutionary epistemology\u201d, the\ngrowth of human knowledge is an objective evolutionary process which\ninvolves the creation and promulgation of new problem-solving\ntheories, which are then subjected to the challenge of criticism,\nmodification, elimination and replacement. These latter activities are\nseen by Popper as growth-promoting in the evolution of knowledge,\nwhich he represents by means of a tetradic schema (1979: 287):\n\n\\[ P_1 \\rightarrow \\textit{TT} \\rightarrow \\textit{EE} \\rightarrow P_2. \\]\n\n\nHere \u201c\\(P_1\\)\u201d stands for the \u201cinitial\nproblem\u201d; \u201cTT\u201d stands for \u201ctentative\ntheory\u201d designed to solve it, \u201cEE\u201d stands\nfor \u201cattempts at error-elimination\u201d, and\n\u201c\\(P_2\\)\u201d represents further problems that arise out of\nthe critical process.\n\nThis kind of knowledge development, Popper argues, cannot be explained\neither by physicalism, which seeks to reduce all mental processes and\nstates to material ones, or by dualism, which usually seeks to\nexplicate knowledge by means of psychological categories such as\nthought, perception and belief. Consequently, he proposes a novel form\nof pluralistic realism, a \u201cThree Worlds\u201d ontology, which,\nwhile accommodating both the world of physical states and processes\n(world 1) and the mental world of psychological processes (world 2),\nrepresents knowledge in its objective sense as belonging to world 3, a\nthird, objectively real ontological category. That world is the\nworld\n\n\nof the products of the human mind, such as languages; tales and\nstories and religious myths; scientific conjectures or theories, and\nmathematical constructions; songs and symphonies; paintings and\nsculptures. (1980: 144)\n\n\nIn short, world 3 is the world of human cultural artifacts, which are\nproducts of world 2 mental processes, usually instantiated in the\nphysical world 1 environment.\n\nPopper proceeds to explicate his distinction between the subjective\nand objective senses of knowledge by reference to this ontology. The\nsubjective sense of knowledge relates to psychological processes and\nstates, mental dispositions, beliefs and expectations, which may\ngenerically be termed \u201cthought processes\u201d and which belong\nto world 2. Knowledge in the objective sense, by contrast, consists\nnot of thought processes but of thought contents, that is to\nsay, the content of propositionalised theories: it is\n\n\nthe content which can be, at least approximately, translated from one\nlanguage into another. The objective thought content is that which\nremains invariant in a reasonably good translation. (1980: 156)\n\n\nAnd it is that thought content, when linguistically codified in texts,\nworks of art, log tables, mathematical formulae, which constitutes\nworld 3, to which objective knowledge relates.\n\nFor those who would suggest that such objects are mere abstractions\nfrom world 2 thought processes, Popper counters that world 3 objects\nare necessarily more than the thought processes which have led to\ntheir creation. Theories, for example, usually have logical\nimplications beyond anything considered by their original author, as\ninstanced in the case of Einstein\u2019s Special Theory of\nRelativity. Moreover, what is most characteristic about such objects\nis that, unlike world 2 mental processes, they can stand in logical\nrelationships to each other, such as equivalence, deducibility and\ncompatibility, which makes them amenable to the kind of critical\nrational analysis and development that is one of the hallmarks of\nscience. As he puts it,\n\n\nCriticism of world 3 objects is of the greatest importance, both in\nart and especially in science. Science can be said to be largely the\nresult of the critical examination and selection of conjectures, of\nthought contents. (1980: 160)\n\n\nPopper takes Michelangelo\u2019s sculpture The Dying Slave\nas an illustrative example of a world 3 object, embodied in a world 1\nblock of marble. Other examples given include memory engrams in the\nbrain, the American Constitution, Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies,\nBeethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony and Newton\u2019s theory of\ngravitation. Each one of these, he contends, is a world 3 object that\ntranscends both its physical, world 1 embodiments and its world 2\ncognitive origins (1980: 145).\n\nPopper was aware that he would be accused of hypostatising\nabstractions in asserting the reality and objectivity of world 3\nobjects. In response, he indicates strongly that he has no interest in\nwhat he regards as pointless terminological disputes over the meaning\nof the term \u201cworld\u201d or \u201creal\u201d. He is therefore\ncontent, if required, to express his account of objective knowledge in\nmore familiar and perhaps more mundane terms: world 3 objects are\nabstract objects while their physical embodiments are\nconcrete objects. But that should not be allowed to disguise\nthe fact that he saw the relationships between the three categories of\nhis ontology as of enormous importance in understanding the role of\nscience as an element of culture:\n\n\nmy thesis is that our world 3 theories and our world 3 plans causally\ninfluence the physical objects of world 1; that they have a causal\naction upon world 1. (1980: 164)\n\n\nIn the final analysis it is the causal interaction between the worlds\nthat ultimately matters in Popper\u2019s objectivist epistemology: it\nallows him to represent the growth of human knowledge as an\nevolutionary process of exosomatic adaptations, which is ultimately a\nfunction of the interplay of relations between the physical and mental\nworlds and the world of objective knowledge or thought content.\n",
