    "preamble": "\n\n\nConstructive and intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories\nare\n axiomatic theories of sets\n in the\nstyle of\n Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF)\n which are based on\n intuitionistic logic.\n They were introduced in the 1970\u2019s and they represent a formal context\n within which to codify mathematics based on intuitionistic logic (see the entry\non\n constructive mathematics).\nThey are formulated on the standard first order language of \nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory and make no direct use of inherently \nconstructive ideas. In working in constructive and intuitionistic \nZF we can thus to some extent rely on our familiarity with ZF and \nits heuristics.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the similarities with classical set theory, the\nconcepts of set defined by constructive and\nintuitionistic set theories differ considerably from that of\nthe classical tradition; they also differ from each other. The\ntechniques utilised to work within them, as well as to obtain\nmetamathematical results about them, also diverge in some respects\nfrom the classical tradition because of their commitment to\nintuitionistic logic. In fact, as is common in intuitionistic\nsettings, a plethora of semantic and proof-theoretic methods are\navailable for the study of constructive and intuitionistic set\ntheories.\n\n\nThis entry introduces the main features of constructive and intuitionistic set theories. As the field is expanding at a fast \npace, we can only briefly recall some key aspects of results and available techniques. We focus more on\nconstructive set theory to highlight important\nfoundational issues that arise within it.\nNote that we omit a conspicuous part of the literature \non constructive and intuitionistic ZF which relates to their categorical \ninterpretations. This area has seen major developments over the years, so much \nso that an adequate treatment of that progress would require a \nsubstantial extension of this entry. \nThe interested reader might wish to consult the entry on \n category theory \n and its references (see also its\n supplement Programmatic Reading Guide). \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Essence of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theory\n\n\nConstructive and intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories are\nbased on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, and \nrepresent a natural environment within which to codify and study \nmathematics based on intuitionistic logic. \nFor constructive ZF, the main focus has been \nto represent the mathematical\npractice of Bishop (Bishop 1967, Bishop and Bridges\n1985).\n\n\nFor the basic concepts and the driving ideas of intuitionistic logic,\nconstructive mathematics and intuitionism, the reader may wish to\nconsult the following entries:\n\nintuitionistic logic,\nthe development of intuitionistic logic,\nconstructive mathematics,\nintuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics,\nLuitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer.\n\n\n\nFor classical set theory, see the entry on\n set theory.\n\n\nConstructive and intuitionistic ZF are based on the same first-order\nlanguage as classical ZF set theory,\nwhich has only the binary predicate symbol \\(\\in\\) (membership) as\nnon-logical symbol. That is, they are formulated on the basis of\nintuitionistic first-order logic with equality, plus the binary\npredicate symbol \\(\\in\\). We can thus take advantage of the simplicity\nof the set-theoretic language and of our familiarity with it (Myhill\n1975). As with Bishop-style constructive mathematics, Constructive and\nintuitionistic ZF are compatible with the classical\ntradition, in the sense that all of their theorems are classically\ntrue. In fact, the two formal systems that we shall consider,\nConstructive Zermelo-Fraenkel (CZF) and Intuitionistic\nZermelo-Fraenkel (IZF), give rise to full classical ZF by the simple\naddition of the principle of the excluded middle.\n1.1 Axiomatic freedom\n\n\nClassical Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is based on classical\nfirst-order predicate logic with equality. On top of the logical\nprinciples are axioms and schemata which describe the notion of set\nthe theory codifies. These principles can be classified into three\nkinds. First, there are principles that enable us to form new sets\nfrom given ones. For example, the axiom of pair allows us to form a\nset which is the pair of two given sets. Secondly, there are\nprinciples that establish properties of the set theoretic\nstructure. For example, the axiom of extensionality identifies all\nsets having the same elements. Third, and finally, there are axioms\nasserting the existence of specific sets. Thus the axiom of infinity\nstates that there is an infinite set. These principles all together\nare usually called the set-theoretic principles.\n\n\nWhen introducing versions of ZF based on intuitionistic logic, the\nfirst step is to eliminate from the logic the principle of the\nexcluded middle (EM). The next step is to choose a good stock of\nset-theoretic principles which faithfully represent the desired notion\nof constructive set. These tasks turn out to be more challenging than\none at first might have expected. In fact, as is well known, systems\nbased on a \u201cweaker\u201d logic have the ability to distinguish\nbetween statements which are equivalent from the point of view of a\n\u201cstronger\u201d logic. In the case of set theory, some of the\nZF axioms or schemata are often presented by one of many classically\nequivalent formulations. Classically it is only a matter of\nconvenience which one to use at a specific time. When working on the\nbasis of intuitionistic logic, however, various formulations of a\nclassical axiom may turn out to be distinct (non-equivalent). In fact,\none can envisage new statements which are classically equivalent to a\nZF axiom but intuitionistically separate from it (for example CZF\u2019s\nsubset collection axiom (Aczel 1978)).\n\n\nAs to the first step, consisting in eliminating the principle of\nexcluded middle from the logic, it turns out that simply evicting this\nprinciple from the underlying logic is insufficient; that is, it is\nnot enough to take the intuitionistic rather than the classical\npredicate calculus as our basis. We also need to ensure that the set\ntheoretic axioms do not bring undesirable forms of excluded middle\nback into our theory. For example, as noted by Myhill (1973), we need\nextra care in choosing an appropriate statement for the axiom of\nfoundation. Foundation is introduced in set theory to rule out sets\nwhich are members of themselves and thus \\(\\in\\)-chains of sets. The\nusual formulation of foundation asserts that each inhabited set (a set\nwith at least one element) has a least element with respect to the\nmembership relation. This statement, however, can be shown to yield\nconstructively unacceptable instances of excluded middle on the basis\nof modest set-theoretic assumptions. Therefore the usual formulation\nof foundation has to be omitted from a set theory based on\nintuitionistic logic. For a proof, see the supplementary document:\nSet-theoretic principles incompatible with intuitionistic logic.\nThe typical move in formulating set theories based on\nintuitionistic logic is then to replace foundation with the\nclassically equivalent schema of set induction, which does not have\nthe same \u201cside effects\u201d but has similar\n consequences.[1]\nAs to the second step, related to the selection of a good stock of \nset-theoretic principles, the schemata of replacement and\nseparation, and the axiom of power set have attracted most attention. For\nthe exact formulation of these principles see the supplementary\ndocument:\nAxioms of CZF and IZF.\n\n\nHere the following is a typical scenario. Given what are classically two variants\nof a single set-theoretic principle, their classical proof of equivalence requires \nat some point an instance of the excluded middle. However, in general this\nproof of equivalence will not carry through to an\nintuitionistic context, and thus what are classically two forms of one principle\nmay result into two distinct principles when working intuitionistically. \nChoosing one rather than\nthe other of them may therefore influence the notion of set we thus define. \nIn the context of constructive set theories like CZF, power set and \nseparation are \nreplaced by intuitionistically weaker principles. One reason for this is that \nthe full strenght of power set and full separation are seen as unnecessary, \nsince their weaker substitutes seem to \nsuffice for carrying out constructive mathematics. Another reason is that they \nare seen as philosophically problematic, since they may introduce forms of\nimpredicativity within the set theory (see the section on\n Predicativity in constructive set theory).\nThe case of replacement versus collection is somehow more complex (see,\nfor example, the articles (Friedman and Scedrov 1985), (Rathjen 2005)\nand (Rathjen 2012)). It is worth stressing that while adopting the\nusual formulation of foundation goes against the very assumption of\nintuitionistic logic as background logic, the principles of separation\nand power set have no incompatibility with intuitionistic logic at\nall, so much so that they are integral part of the intuitionistic\ntheory of sets IZF (Friedman 1973a).\n\n\n\nTo summarise, in formulating a set theory based on intuitionistic\nlogic, the first task is to expel the principle of excluded middle,\nincluding those instances of it which might be hidden in familiar\nformulations of set-theoretic axioms. The next task is to choose one\nversion of each classical principle which best characterises the\ndesired notion of set. This opens up a range of choices one can make,\nas a plurality of intuitionistic principles may correspond to one\nclassical principle. It should be stressed that from a constructive\npoint of view this plurality of options (and thus systems), rather\nthan causing uneasiness, is a highly desirable situation, as it\nconstitutes a form of \u201caxiomatic freedom\u201d. For example, it\nallows us to differentiate between a number of mathematical notions,\nthus better capturing our intuitions of them as distinct. It also\ngives us the freedom to choose the notions and theories which best\nsuit a given context. In addition, by adopting intuitionistic logic\nwe can include within our theories principles which are classically\nvery strong, without having to commit to their classical strength. For\nexample, one can add a notion of inaccessible set to a weak\nconstructive set theory and obtain a predicative theory,\nwhile the same notion embedded in a classical context becomes\nextremely strong (see the sections on\n Predicativity in constructive set theory and \nLarge sets in constructive and intuitionistic ZF).\nFinally, a rich area of (meta-theoretical) study of the relations\nbetween the resulting distinct set-theoretic systems naturally\narises. As one could expect, this freedom also has a price, as a\nhighly technical study of the axiomatic theories might be necessary to\ndistinguish their principles as well as to unveil some of their\nsubtleties. This again can be seen as an advantage, since it forces us\nto a deeper and clearer analysis of the mathematical notions involved\nand prompts us to develop new sophisticated tools.\n1.2 Constructive versus intuitionistic set theory\n\n\nAlthough there are many systems of sets based on\nintuitionistic logic, we can distinguish two main trends within the\nliterature. According to the first one, we take all of what is\navailable in classical ZF set theory and only modify those principles,\nsuch as foundation, which have a clear incompatibility with\nintuitionistic logic. This gives rise to set theories such as\nIntuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel,\n IZF,\na variant of which was introduced as early as in (Friedman\n1973a). (See Beeson 1985, Chapters 8 and 9 and Scedrov 1985 for two\nsurveys on IZF.) The rationale behind these theories appears to be\nthat of granting the mathematician the most powerful tools possible,\nas long as compatibility with intuitionistic logic is\npreserved. According to the second approach, in addition to the\nadherence to intuitionistic logic we also introduce restrictions on\nthe set-theoretic principles admitted, as far as the resulting system\ncomplies with the constructive mathematical practice. Theories of\nthis second kind can thus be seen as the outcome of a double process\nof restriction with respect to classical ZF. First there is a\nrestriction to intuitionistic logic, then a restriction is imposed on\nthe set-theoretic constructions allowed. The latter is motivated by\n(1) the observation that weaker principles appear to suffice for the\nconstructive mathematical practice and (2) the desire to adhere to a\nform of predicativity (see the next section for a clarification of\nthis notion of predicativity). Paradigmatic examples of the latter\nkind of systems are Myhill\u2019s Constructive Set Theory (Myhill 1975),\nFriedman\u2019s system B (Friedman 1977) and Aczel\u2019s Constructive\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory\n CZF\n (Aczel 1978; 1982; 1986, Aczel & Rathjen\n2001; Aczel & Rathjen 2010, Other Internet Resources). We can also say that in this second approach the foundational\nmotivation influences the practice to a higher degree.\n\n\nIn the following we make use of a convention which is often in\nplace today, according to which the adjective\n\u201cintuitionistic\u201d refers to those set theories, such as\nIZF, which are impredicative, while \u201cconstructive\u201d refers\nto set theories, such as CZF, which comply with a form of\npredicativity. Note, however, that this convention is\nnot always followed in the literature. In fact, the adjective\n\u201cconstructive\u201d has also been used to denote impredicative\ntheories, and \u201cintuitionistic\u201d to refer to predicative\nfoundational theories such as Martin-L\u00f6f type theory\n(Martin-L\u00f6f 1975; 1984). It is also worth noting that the present\nconvention on the use of the words \u201cconstructive\u201d and\n\u201cintuitionistic\u201d differs from that made in the context of\nconstructive mathematics (see, for example, the entry\non constructive mathematics\nand also Bridges and Richman 1987).\n1.3 Predicativity in constructive set theory\n\n\nPredicativism has its origins in the writings of Poincar\u00e9 and\nRussell, who responded to the paradoxes that were discovered in\nCantor\u2019s and Frege\u2019s set theories in the early 20th\ncentury. Subsequently Weyl made fundamental contributions to the study\nof predicative mathematics (Weyl 1918, see also Feferman 1988).\nAccording to one notion, a definition is impredicative if it\ndefines an object by reference to a totality which includes the object\nto be defined. With his Vicious Circle Principle (VCP), Russell\nintended to eliminate the circularity in mathematics that arises from\nsuch impredicative definitions. Russell gave various formulations of the VCP, one of which is:\n\n Whatever contains an apparent variable must not be a possible value\n of that variable (Russell 1908, in van Heijenoort 1967, 163).\n\n\n\nPoincar\u00e9, Russell and Weyl\u2019s foundational analysis of\npredicativity has paved the way for a variety of logical analyses of\nthe notion. The most commonly accepted analysis is due to Feferman and\nSch\u00fctte (independently) following lines indicated by Kreisel\n(Kreisel 1958, Feferman 1964 and Sch\u00fctte 1965; 1965a). Here\nproof theory has played a pivotal role. In very rough terms, the idea\nwas to single out a collection of theories (a transfinite progression\nof systems of ramified second order arithmetic indexed by ordinals) by\nmeans of which to characterise a certain notion of predicative\nordinal. Feferman and Sch\u00fctte\u2019s proof theoretic analysis of these\ntheories has identified an ordinal, usually referred to as\n\\(\\Gamma_0\\), which is the least non-predicative ordinal\naccording to this notion. A formal system is considered \npredicatively justifiable if it is proof-theoretically reducible to a\nsystem of ramified second order arthmetic indexed by an ordinal less\nthen \\(\\Gamma_0\\). Therefore in proof theory\n\\(\\Gamma_0\\) is usually considered as representing the limit of\npredicativity. (See Feferman 2005 for a more accurate informal\naccount of this notion of predicativity and for further\nreferences. See also Crosilla 2017. The reader may also consult the section on\n predicativism\n in the entry on philosophy of mathematics and the entry on\n paradoxes and contemporary\nlogic).\n\n\nFor constructive foundational theories a more\n\u201cliberal\u201d approach to predicativism has been suggested,\nstarting from work in the late 1950\u2019s of Lorenzen, Myhill and Wang\n(see e.g. Lorenzen and Myhill 1959). The driving idea is that\nso-called inductive definitions ought to be allowed in the\nrealm of constructive mathematics. The intuitive justification of\ninductive definitions is related to the fact that they can be\nexpressed by means of finite rules, in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d way.\nThe proof-theoretic strength of theories of inductive definitions goes\nwell beyond Feferman and Sch\u00fctte\u2019s bound (Buchholz, Feferman,\nPohlers and Sieg 1981). Thus relatively strong theories are considered\npredicative in today\u2019s foundations of constructive mathematics. This\nmore liberal notion of predicativity has often been\ntermed generalised predicativity. In this entry we \nsimply write predicativity for generalised predicativity and call \npredicativity given the natural numbers the better known form of predicativity which arises in the classical context and was analysed by Kreisel, Feferman and Sch\u00fctte.\nAn example of a predicative theory in this sense is the\nconstructive set theory CZF, as its proof-theoretic strength is the\nsame as that of a theory of one inductive definition known as\nID\\(_1\\). The system IZF, instead, is impredicative, as its\nproof-theoretic strength equates that of the whole of classical ZF\n(Friedman 1973a).\n\n\nIn set theories based on intuitionistic logic, predicativity is usually\nachieved by restricting the principles of separation and power set, as\nthese appear to be the main sources of impredicativity (when the\ninfinity axiom is assumed). \n1.3.1 Impredicativity of Separation\n\n\nThe schema of separation allows us to form a subset of a given set\nwhose elements satisfy a given property (expressed by a formula in the\nlanguage of set theory). Given a set \\(B\\) and a formula \\(\\phi(X)\\),\nseparation allows us to construct a new set, the set of those elements\n\\(X\\) of \\(B\\) for which \\(\\phi\\) holds. This is usually informally\nrepresented as: \\(\\{X \\in B : \\phi(X)\\}\\). Separation may lead to\nimpredicativity in case the formula \\(\\phi\\) contains unbounded\nquantifiers ranging over the whole universe of sets; in fact, in\ndefining the new set by separation we may thus refer to this very set,\ncontradicting Russell\u2019s VCP. For example, if we define a set\n\\(C\\) by separation as \\(\\{X\\in B : \\forall Y \\psi(X,Y)\\}\\), then\n\\(C\\) is among the \\(Y\\)\u2019s that need to be checked for the\nproperty \\(\\psi\\).  This form of impredicativity is avoided in\nconstructive set theory by restricting the separation schema: by\nrequiring that all quantifiers occurring in the formula \\(\\phi\\) range\nonly over \u201cpreviously constructed\u201d sets. Syntactically,\nthis means that given a set \\(B\\), we can form a new set \\(\\{X \\in B :\n\\phi(X)\\}\\) by separation only if all quantifiers in \\(\\phi\\) are\nbounded; that is, only if all quantifiers in \\(\\phi\\) are of the form\n\\(\\forall X (X\\in Y \\rightarrow \\ldots)\\) or \\(\\exists X(X\\in Y \\wedge\n\\ldots)\\), for some set \\(Y\\).\n\nWe can see that constraining separation in this way avoids impredicativity, by \nobserving that the\nproof theoretic strength of CZF, which has only restricted separation,\nis within the range of predicativity. However, by adding full\nseparation to CZF one obtains an impredicative theory, in fact, one\nwith the same proof-theoretic strength as full second order arithmetic\n(Lubarsky 2006). See also Section 5 for a discussion of the role of proof theory\nin analysing constructive and intuitionistic set theories. \n1.3.2 Impredicativity of Powerset\n\n\nThe power set axiom allows us to form a set of all subsets of\na given set. An example of impredicative use of power set is given by\nthe definition of a subset of the natural numbers, \\(N\\), as follows:\n\\(B := \\{n \\in N : \\forall C \\subseteq N \\phi(n, C)\\}\\), where\n\\(\\phi\\) can be taken to be a bounded formula. A form of circularity\narises here as \\(B\\) itself is among the subsets of \\(N\\) which need\nto be checked for \\(\\phi\\). As emphasized by Myhill (1975, 354), power\nset is hard to justify from a constructive point of view: it gathers\ntogether all the subsets of a given set, but does not prescribe a rule\nthat \"constructs\" the set out of previously given sets, as\npredicativity would seem to require.\n\nMyhill writes:\nPower set seems especially nonconstructive and\nimpredicative compared with the other axioms: it does not involve, as\nthe others do, putting together or taking apart sets that one has\nalready constructed but rather selecting out of the totality of all\nsets those that stand in the relation of inclusion to a given\nset. (Myhill 1975, 351).\n\nPower set seems particularly problematic in the case of infinite sets, \nas \"we have no idea of what an arbitrary subset of an infinite set is; there is no way of generating them all and so we have no way to form the set of all of them\" (Myhill 1975, 354).\nAs a consequence, there seems to be no way of giving constructive sense to the set of all subsets of an infinite set. \n\nMyhill crucially observes that power set is not needed for constructive \nmathematics Bishop-style, as it can be replaced by one of its\nconsequences. This is often called Myhill\u2019s exponentiation\naxiom and states that we can form a set of all functions\nfrom one given set to another. This axiom is clearly\nequivalent to power set in a classical context, where subsets of a\ngiven set may be represented by characteristic functions. In the\nabsence of the principle of excluded middle, however, power set and\nexponentiation are not equivalent.\nMyhill\u2019s fundamental observation is that exponentiation suffices to carry out \nthe mathematics of (Bishop 1967); for example, it allows for \nthe construction of the (Cauchy) real numbers within constructive set theory. \nMyhill claims that exponentiation is constructively meaningful because a function is a rule, \na finite object which can actually be given.\n\nHe also writes that the case of power set is different from that of\nexponentiation as:\neven in the case of infinite sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) we do\nhave an idea of an arbitrary mapping from \\(A\\) into \\(B\\). An\narbitrary mapping from \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) into \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is a partial\nrecursive function together with a proof that the computation always\nterminates; a similar account can be given of an arbitrary real\nfunction. There is no corresponding explanation of\n\u201carbitrary subset\u201d. (Myhill 1975,\n354).\n\n\nMyhill\u2019s exponentiation axiom is now part of all major systems of\nconstructive set theory. In the case of CZF, in fact, one has a\nstrengthening of exponentiation, known as subset collection, which is\nalso a weakening of power set. A generalisation of exponentiation can\nalso be found in constructive type theory.\n\nIn the case of CZF, the claim that adding the power set axiom \ninduces a form of impredicativity can\nbe substantiated by a technical result. Rathjen (2012b) shows that CZF\naugmented by the power set axiom exceeds the strength of classical Zermelo set theory,\nand thus the addition of the power set axiom to CZF \nbrings us to a fully impredicative theory. This also shows that the\nimplication from power set to subset collection can not be reversed,\nas CZF\u2019s proof-theoretic strength is way below that of Zermleo\nset-theory. In other terms, the power set axiom is much stronger than \nboth exponentiation and subset collection. \n1.3.3 The constructive universe of sets\n\n\nHaving introduced appropriate constraints to power set and separation,\nwe could now face a substantial objection. Constructive and\nintuitionistic set theories can be seen as modifications of classical\nZF set theory that are obtained by: (1) replacing classical with\nintuitionistic logic, and (2) accurately choosing, among various\nclassically equivalent principles, those which seem more appropriate\nfor given purposes. For example, we might choose principles which\nsuffice to represent a certain mathematical practice, like, for\nexample, Bishop style mathematics. The resulting notion of set,\nhowever, might become obscure and the choice of the set-theoretic\nprinciples might appear to a certain degree as arbitrary. In the case\nof intuitionistic ZF, one can justify the choice of the set-theoretic\nprinciples by examining its semantical interpretations, as Heyting\nsemantics, or by looking at its categorical models. In the case of\nconstructive set theory, to hinder this kind of objection, Aczel has\ngiven an interpretation of CZF in a version of Martin-L\u00f6f type\ntheory (Aczel 1978). The claim is that a clear constructive meaning is\nthus assigned to CZF\u2019s notion of set by looking at its meaning in\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theory, since the latter is usually considered as\nrepresenting an accurate and fully motivated formulation of a\nconstructive notion of set. Aczel\u2019s interpretation of CZF in\nconstructive type theory is given by interpeting sets\nas trees in type theory. That is, in constructive type theory \nthe universe of sets of CZF is represented by a type, V, of iterative sets built over the\nuniverse, U, of small types (Aczel 1978;\nMartin-L\u00f6f 1984). This interpretation clearly highlights the\n(generalised) predicativity of CZF, whose sets can be seen as trees built up inductively, and whose set theoretic universe also has a clear inductive\nstructure.\n\nThe predicativity of CZF and related systems is consonant with\nphilosophical positions which are often associated with the use of\nintuitionistic logic. In particular, it would seem that if\nwe construct the mathematical objects, for example, if the\nmathematical objects are mental constructions of some kind, then\nresorting to impredicative definitions would produce an undesirable\nform of circularity. This clearly contrasts with a view often\nassociated to classical set theory, for which our mathematical\nactivity can be seen as a gradual disclosure of properties of the\nuniverse of sets, whose existence is independent from us. Such a view is\nusually bound up with the use of classical logic and impredicativity\nin studying the set-theoretic universe. Predicativity is also often\nseen as related to the time-honoured distinction between actual and\npotential infinity. Predicative (and thus, in particular,\nconstructive) theories are often seen as avoiding reference to actual\ninfinity, and only committing to potential infinity (Dummett 2000,\nFletcher 2007). This again seems particularly in harmony with those\nphilosophical positions which highlight the human dimension of our\nmathematical activity, by seeing, for example, the mathematical\nobjects and the truth of statements about them as dependent on\nus. Another related aspect is often seen as pertaining to\npredicativity: if the universe of sets is built up in stages by our\nown mathematical activity, then it would be natural also to see it\nas open ended. For this reason, in a constructive context,\nwhere the rejection of classical logic meets the requirement of\npredicativity, the universe of sets is often described as an open\nconcept, a universe \u201cin fieri\u201d. This idea is especially\nwell exemplified within constructive type theory, where the notion of\ntype-theoretic universe has been deliberately left open by Per\nMartin-L\u00f6f (by not postulating specific elimination rules for\nit). The open ended nature of the universe of sets has paved the way\nfor extensions of it by reflection principles. These have been\ninvestigated both within type theory and constructive set theory. See\n(Rathjen 2005a) for a survey of results and a foundational discussion,\nand also section 5.2. \nFor a formal analysis of the constructive universe of sets and a comparison with the Von Neumann hierarchy, see (Ziegler 2014). \n2. Origins of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theories\n\n\nIntuitionistic versions of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories were\nintroduced in the early 1970s by Friedman and Myhill. In (Friedman\n1973) the author presents a study of formal properties of various\nintuitionistic systems and introduces for them an extension of\nKleene\u2019s realisability method. The realisability technique is applied\nin (Myhill 1973) to show the existence property for a version of\nintuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with replacement in place\nof collection). In another fundamental contribution Friedman extends\nthe double negation translation of intuitonistic logic to relate\nclassical and intuitionistic set theories (Friedman 1973a). These\nfirst papers already address the relation between some major\nintuitionistic set theories and classical ZF. They also clarify a key\nfeature of set theory based on intuitionistic logic, mainly that it is\namenable to powerful constructive semantic interpretations, like\nrealizability. These techniques are applied to the study of crucial\nmetatheoretical properties which are typical of the constructive\napproach and which are enjoyed by some constructive set theories (see\nthe section on\n Semantic techniques). \nThis groundbreaking work has been fully exploited and substantially\nextended in work by Beeson and McCarty (see Beeson 1985; McCarty\n1984).\n\n\nConstructive set theory from the very start has a more distinctive\nfoundational vocation and it is bound up with Bishop\u2019s mathematics. In\nfact, in 1967 Bishop published the book \u201cFoundations of\nconstructive analysis\u201d (Bishop 1967), which opened up a new era\nfor mathematics based on intuitionistic logic (see the entry on\n constructive mathematics).\nThe monograph stimulated fresh attempts in the logical community to\nclarify and formally represent the principles which were used by\nBishop, though only at an informal level. First attempts by Goodman\nand Myhill (Goodman and Myhill 1972) made use of versions of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s system T (see also (Bishop 1970) for a similar\nattempt). Myhill, however, reached the conclusion that the resulting\nformalisation was too complex and artificial (Myhill 1975,\n347). Myhill proposed instead a system which is closer to the informal\nnotion of set originally utilised by Bishop and also closer to the\nset-theoretic tradition. Myhill writes (1975, 347):\nWe refuse to believe that things have to be this complicated -\nthe argumentation of (Bishop 1967) looks very smooth and seems to \nfall directly from a certain concept of what sets, functions, etc. are, and\nwe wish to discover a formalism which isolates the principles underlying \nthis conception in the same way that Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\nisolates the principles underlying classical (nonconstructive)\nmathematics. We want these principles to be such as to make the\nprocess of formalization completely trivial, as it is in the classical\ncase.\n\n\nWe observe here that Myhill\u2019s constructive set theory had\ndistinguished notions of function, natural number and set; it thus\nclosely represented a constructive tradition in which functions and\nnatural numbers are conceptually independent from sets. Another\nfundamental step in the development of constructive set theory was\nFriedman\u2019s \u201cSet-theoretical foundations for constructive\nanalysis\u201d (Friedman 1977). Here, among other systems, a system\ncalled B is defined which has further restrictions on the\nset-theoretic principles compared with Myhill\u2019s (in particular, it has\nno set induction). It also has a restricted form of the axiom of\ndependent choice. System B is there shown to be expressive enough to\nrepresent the constructive analysis of Bishop (1967) whilst being at\nthe same time proof-theoretically very weak (due to the absence of set\ninduction). System B is in fact a conservative extension of\narithmetic (thus it is well below the limit of predicativity given the natural numbers\nbriefly recalled in section\n 1.3).\n Myhill and Friedman\u2019s systems were\nsubsequently modified by Aczel, to obtain a system, CZF (Constructive\nZermelo-Fraenkel), that is fully compatible with the ZF language\n(Aczel 1978, 1982, 1986; Aczel and Rathjen 2001; 2010). CZF also\nincluded no choice principles. Aczel gave an interpretation of CZF in\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theory with the aim of corroborating the\nconstructive nature of the set theory. He also strengthened some of\nthe principles of Myhill\u2019s system (namely, collection and\nexponentiation) on the ground that the stronger versions are still\nvalidated by the interpretation in type theory.\n\n\nOther foundational systems for\nBishop-style constructive mathematics were introduced in the early\n1970\u2019s. For example: explicit mathematics by S. Feferman\n(Feferman 1975), and the already mentioned Intuitionistic Type\nTheory (Martin-L\u00f6f 1975; 1984). \nConstructive type theory is usually considered the \nmost satisfactory foundation for constructive mathematics Bishop-style. \nBoth type theory and explicit mathematics can be seen as expressing \nmore directly the computational \ncontent of constructive mathematics. Type theory, in particular, \ncan be read as a very general and expressive programming language. \nConstructive and intuitionistic set\ntheories display their computational\ncontent only indirectly through their semantic interpretations\n(see e.g. (Aczel 1977), (Lipton 1995) and the section on\n Semantic techniques).\n3. The Axioms Systems CZF and IZF\n\n\nFor a reader who is already familiar with ZF set theory, we now\nbriefly recall the axioms of the systems CZF and IZF. For a full list\nand an explanation of their axioms we refer instead to the\nsupplementary document:\nAxioms of CZF and IZF.\n\n\nCZF and IZF are formulated on the basis of\n intuitionistic first-order logic\nwith equality, having only \\(\\in\\) (membership) as an additional\nnon-logical binary predicate symbol. Their set-theoretic axioms are as\nfollows.\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{IZF}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{CZF}\\)\n\n\nExtensionality\n(same)\n\n\nPair\n(same)\n\n\nUnion\n(same)\n\n\nInfinity\n(same)\n\n\nSeparation\nRestricted Separation\n\n\nCollection\nStrong Collection\n\n\nPowerset\nSubset Collection\n\n\nSet Induction\n(same)\n\n\n\nNote that in IZF the schema of separation is unrestricted.\nIn CZF, Collection is strengthened to compensate for restricted separation.\nSubset collection is a strengthening of Myhill\u2019s exponentiation axiom,\nthus substituting for ZF\u2019s Powerset. \n4. Constructive Choice Principles\n\n\nWhen discussing the role of classical set theory as a foundation for\nmathematics, one usually considers the theory ZFC, that is, the axiom\nsystem ZF plus the axiom of choice (AC). One might therefore wonder\nwhat is the status of the axiom of choice in intuitionistic\nsettings. The question is particularly significant because at its\nfirst appearance the axiom of choice was often seen as controversial\nand highly non-constructive. In constructive contexts, however, one\nwitnesses a peculiar phenomenon. The usual form of the axiom of choice\nis validated by theories of types such as Martin-L\u00f6f type theory,\nwhere the Curry-Howard correspondence holds\n(See Section 3.4\n of the entry on\n Constructive mathematics). \nOn the other hand, the assumption of the axiom of\nchoice gives rise to instances of the excluded middle\nin extensional contexts, where a form of separation is also\navailable. This is the case, for example, of constructive and\nintuitionistic ZF. (For the proof, see the supplementary document\non Set-theoretic Principles Incompatible with Intuitionistic Logic.) \nA proof of the\nincompatibility of AC with extensional set theories based on\nintuitionistic logic seems to have first appeared in (Diaconescu 1975)\nin a categorical context. Goodman and Myhill give an argument for set\ntheories based on intuitionistic logic (Goodman and Myhill 1978). \n\n\nAlthough the axiom of choice is incompatible with both constructive\nand intuitionistic ZF, other choice principles may be added to the\nbasic systems without producing the same undesirable results. For\nexample one could add the principle of countable choice\n(AC\\(_0)\\) or that of dependent choice (DC). In fact, \nboth have been often\nemployed in the constructive mathematical practice. \n(For their exact formulation see the supplementary document on \nAxioms of CZF and IZF.)\n\nIn (Aczel 1978) the author also considered a choice principle called the Presentation\nAxiom, which asserts that every set is the\nsurjective image of a so-called base. A base is a set,\nsay \\(B\\), such that every relation with domain \\(B\\)\nextends a function with domain \\(B\\).\n\nThe compatibility of all these forms of choice with constructive set\ntheory has been proved by Aczel by extending his\ninterpretation of CZF in Martin-L\u00f6f type theory (Aczel\n1982). Rathjen (2006) has also considered various constructive choice\nprinciples and their mutual relations.\n\n\nA final remark: although constructive and intuitionistic set theories\nare compatible with the principles of choice just mentioned, the set\ntheories are often defined without any choice principles. This has\nthe aim of allowing for a \u201cpluralistic\u201d foundational\napproach. In particular, one would like to obtain a foundational\ntheory compatible with those contexts (e.g. categorical models\nof set theory) in which even these weaker principles of choice may not be\nvalidated. For similar ideas in the context of constructive type\ntheory, see (Maietti and Sambin 2005, Maietti 2009). We wish also to mention here\nRichman\u2019s appeal for a constructive mathematics which makes no\nuse of choice principles (Richman 2000; 2001).\n5. Proof Theory and Semantics of Constructive and Intuitionistic ZF\n\n\nIn considering a certain mathematical practice (or a theory used to\ncodify it) from a philosophical perspective, we need to clarify\nwith the greatest possible precision the assumptions which are made\nwithin it as well as the consequences which arise from those\nassumptions. This is particularly true when working with theories\nwhich are based on a weaker logic than the classical one, for which a\ndeeper, more precise insight is mandatory. Many technical tools are\navailable which can help us clarify those aspects. Among the available\ninstruments, there are proof-theoretic techniques, such as\nproof-theoretic interpretations, as well as semantic techniques, such\nas realisability, Kripke models, Heyting-valued semantics. In fact, in\nthe literature one often witnesses the interplay of proof-theoretic\nand semantic techniques. We here give a cursory look into some of\nthese topics and suggest further reading.\n5.1 Proof-theoretic strength\n\nA fundamental theme in proof theory (in particular in the branch of\nthis discipline known as ordinal analysis) is the classification of\ntheories by means of transfinite ordinals which measure their\n\"consistency strength\" and \"computational power\".  These ordinals give\nan indication of how strong a theory is, and therefore offer a way of\ncomparing different theories. For example, the ordinal\n\\(\\varepsilon_0\\) is the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano Arithmetic,\nand is much smaller than the ordinal \\(\\Gamma_0\\), usually referred to\nas \"the limit of predicativity\" \n (see section 1.3 above). \n This is indicative that there are predicatively acceptable theories\nwhich are much stronger than Peano Arithmetic. \n\nAs discussed in section 1, the step\nfrom classical ZF to its intuitionistic variants requires us to choose\na suitable formulation for each set-theoretic axiom: one classical \naxiom may have a number of intuitionistic variants which turn out to be \nnon-equivalent to each other. This is sometimes reflected by the proof-theoretic\nstrength of the resulting theories, which may vary depending on which principles we choose. \nFor example, we already noted that \nin CZF we do not have full separation and power set, which are \nreplaced by the predicatively acceptable principles of bounded separation and \nsubset collection, respectively. However, if\nwe add to CZF either of these principles, we obtain impredicative\ntheories. The impredicativity of the resulting theories is witnessed \nby the fact that their proof-theoretic strenght far exceeds that of CZF.\n\nIt is not surprising that investigations on the proof-theoretic\nstrength of constructive and intutionistic set theories have been a\ncrucial meta-theoretical tool for understanding these theories and\ntheir relations with each other. Investigations on the\nproof-theoretic strength of a theory are rich and informative. In\nparticular, Feferman (1993) has argued that a proof-theoretic analysis\nmay help us establish whether a certain theory complies with a given\nphilosophical framework: for example, the analysis may reveal that a\ntheory is predicative or finitistic etc. Furthermore, as a by-product\nof the proof-theoretic analysis we sometimes obtain simple\nindependence proofs. In fact, we can show that a theory cannot prove a\nspecific principle because adding it to the theory would increase the\ntheory\u2019s proof-theoretic strength. For example, CZF does not prove the\npowerset axiom, as the addition of powerset to CZF gives rise to a\nmuch stronger theory. Proof-theoretic interpretations have also been\nemployed to compare constructive and intuitionistic ZF set theories\namong each others, as well as with their classical counterparts, and\nalso with other foundational systems for constructive mathematics,\nsuch as constructive type theory and explicit mathematics (see\ne.g., Griffor and Rathjen 1994, Tupailo 2003). For a definition\nof the notion of proof-theoretic strength and for surveys on proof\ntheory see, for example, (Rathjen 1999, 2006b). \n\n\nAlthough CZF and IZF are the most widely studied systems, numerous\nother systems for constructive and intuitionistic set theory have been\nconsidered in the literature so far. The proof-theoretic strength of a\nnumber of constructive and intuitionistic set theories has been\nestablished by a variety of tools, like, for example, an extension to\nset theory of the double negation interpretation (originated in\n(Friedman 1973a)), and a variety of other proof-theoretic\ninterpretations, often resulting from a careful combination of\nsemantic and proof theoretic techniques. In many cases the proof\ntheoretic strength of a system has been determined by a chain of\ninterpretations between constructive and classical systems, and by\nusing a variety of tools, from relisability to more \"traditional\"\nproof theoretic techniques, as ordinal analysis (see, for example,\nBeeson 1985; Griffor and Rathjen 1994; Rathjen 2012b). In particular,\nrealisability has turned out to be very useful, due to its\nflexibility. As to the outcomes of these investigations, some of the\nsystems analysed turn out to be as weak as arithmetic, as, for example,\nFriedman\u2019s system B (Friedman 1977); other systems are as strong as\nfull classical ZF, as IZF (Friedman 1973a). There are also systems of\nintermediate strength, as CZF. The strength of the latter theory, in\nfact, equals that of a theory of one inductive definition known as\nID\\(_1\\). The fact that CZF has the same strength as\nID\\(_1\\) is taken to confirm the (generalised) predicativity of the set\ntheory, and to prove that it exceeds the limit of predicativity given \nthe natural numbers, since ID\\(_1\\)\u2019s proof theoretic ordinal is well above \n\\(\\Gamma_0\\).\n\n\nAs a final remark: while the strength of CZF is well below that of \nsecond-order arithmetic, the simple addition of excluded middle to CZF\ngives us (full) ZF. This should be contrasted with IZF, which already\nhas the strength of ZF (Friedman 1973a). The limited \nproof theoretic strength of CZF compared with IZF has often been considered one of \nthe main advantages of constructive over intuitionistic set\ntheory. In a sense, it would seem that CZF makes the most of \nits use of intuitionistic logic, as it characterises a notion of \n(generalised) predicative set which is sufficiently strong for \nthe development of much of constructive mathematics but also \nweak enough to avoid impredicativity.\nInterestingly, when some large set axioms have been added to\nconstructive set theory, a similar pattern has emerged, as the\nstrength of the resulting theory is well below that of the\ncorresponding classical theory.\n5.2 Large sets in constructive and intuitionistic ZF\n\n\nA prominent area of research in classical set theory is that of large\ncardinals (see the entry on\n set theory). In constructive contexts, the ordinals are not linearly\nordered. (For the notion of constructive ordinal and a brief\ndiscussion of its properties, see the supplementary document on: \nSet-theoretic Principles Incompatible with Intuitionistic Logic.) \n As a consequence, cardinal numbers do not play the same role as in the classical\n setting.\n\n\nOne can nonetheless study the impact of \u201creflection\nprinciples\u201d of the form of large set axioms.\nFor example, one can add to constructive and intuitionistic set theories \nan axiom asserting the existence of inaccessible \nsets.[2] \n The addition of large set axioms to intuitionistic ZF was first proposed\nby Friedman and Scedrov (Friedman and Scedrov 1984). One of their\naim was to shed light on the corresponding classical\nnotions; another was to study the impact of these principles on\nmetatheoretical properties of the original set theories. Friedman and\nScedrov have shown, for example, that the addition of large set axioms\ndoes not compromise the validity of the disjunction and numerical\nexistence properties for IZF.\n\n\nIn the context of constructive set theory, large sets have been\nintroduced by Aczel in the form of so-called regular sets to\nallow inductive definitions of sets (Aczel 1986). Rathjen and Crosilla\nhave considered inaccessible sets (Rathjen al. 1998; Crosilla and\nRathjen 2001) and Mahlo sets (Rathjen 2003a). Nevertheless, an\nobjection could be raised to extensions of constructive set theory by\nlarge set axioms. In classical set theory, large cardinals can be seen\nas an incarnation of higher infinity. How do we justify these\nprinciples constructively? The constructive justification of these\nnotions relies again on the type theoretic interpretation. The\naddition of these principles corresponds in fact to that of universes\nand \\(W\\)-types within constructive type theory. The\njustification of extensions by large sets is thus bound up with the\nquestion of the limits of Martin-L\u00f6f type theory (Rathjen\n2005). We also note that the addition of inacessible set axioms\n to a weak subsystem of CZF\n(with no set induction) produces a theory of strength\n\\(\\Gamma_0\\), the ordinal singled out by Feferman and\nSch\u00fctte as the limit of predicativity given the natural numbers (Crosilla and\nRathjen 2001; see also section 1.3). This is \nwitness to the fact that by working in a constructive, predicative\ncontext, we can tame traditionally strong set-theoretic notions.\n\nCrosilla and Rathjen\u2019s set theory with inaccessible sets (but no set\ninduction) is proof theoretically rather weak, but mathematically\nquite expressive. For example, it has been used to verify that the\naddition of Voevodsky\u2019s Univalence Axiom to Martin-L\u00f6f type\ntheory does not engender impredicativity (Rathjen 2017). The axiom of\nUnivalence was introduced by Voevodsky as part of his Univalent\nFoundations programme (Voevodsky 2015). (For Univalent Foundations,\nsee the entries on \n type theory \nand on\n intuitionistic type theory). \nVoevodsky gave a model of constructive type theory with\nthe Univalence Axiom which is based on Kan simplicial sets (see\nKapulkin & Lumsdaine 2012, Other Internet Resources). The\nsimplicial model of constructive type theory with univalence developed\nin the above article is carried out within an extension of ZFC with\ninaccessible cardinals. This prompted the question whether one could\ngive a more constructive model of this type theory, and, in\nparticular, whether the type theory is predicative. Bezem, Coquand and\nHuber (2014) have recently proposed a model of this type theory in\ncubical sets which is computational and \u201ccan be expressed in a\nconstructive metalogic\u201d. Rathjen (2017) has verified that this new\nmodel can be codified in a suitable extension of CZF by inaccessible\nsets which is much weaker than classical set theory with inaccessible\ncardinals. In fact, it turns out that if we take as starting point a\nrelatively weak type theory, i.e. one without W-types, and extend it\nby the Univalence Axiom, the resulting theory has proof theoretic\nstrength \\(\\Gamma_0\\), the ordinal usually taken to represent the\nlimit of predicativity given the natural numbers (Rathjen 2017). To\nshow this, one proves that the cubical model by Bezem, Coquand and\nHuber can be carried out in an extension of the system introduced in\nCrosilla and Rathjen (2001) by (bounded) Relativized Dependent\nChoice. It follows from (Crosilla and Rathjen 2001) and (Rathjen 2003)\nthat the latter has proof theoretic ordinal \\(\\Gamma_0\\). \n5.3 Metamathematical properties of constructive and intuitionistic ZF and semantic techniques\n\n\nA variety of interpretations for\nintuitionistic logic have been\nextended to intuitionistic and constructive set theories, such as\nrealisability, Kripke models and Heyting-valued semantics. All these\ntechniques have been applied to obtain metamathematical results about\nthe set theories.\n5.3.1 Disjunction and existence properties of constructive and intuitionistic ZF\n\n\nSome intuitionistic set theories satisfy certain\n\u201challmark\u201d metamathematical properties, such as\nthe disjunction and the existence properties. They\ncan also be shown to be consistent with the addition of principles\nwhich go beyond what we most typically consider constructive. Among\nthese are, for example, Church Thesis and Markov\u2019s\nprinciple. For a description of these principles in the context\nof intuitionistic logic, the reader may wish to consult sections 4.2\nand 5.2 of the entry on\nintuitionistic logic or\nTroelstra and van Dalen\u2019s book Constructivism in Mathematics\n(Troelstra and van Dalen 1988).\n\n\nHere we recall the disjunction and existence properties, formulated for\na set theory \\(T\\). The informal motivation for the disjunction and \nthe existence properties is based on our understanding of\nthe constructive proofs of disjunctive and existential statements (respectively). \nIn fact, it seems reasonable to expect that if we constructively prove \na disjunction \\(\\phi \\vee \\psi\\), \nthen we should also be able to prove \\(\\phi\\) or prove \\(\\psi\\). \nSimilarly, if we prove an existential statement, then we should be \nable to prove that a witness to that statement is definable within our theory.\nAlthough such properties seem quite natural and are fairly\neasy to establish for arithmetical theories, they turn out to pose\nconsiderable technical challenges in the case of set theories, due to\ntheir transfinite hierarchies of sets and the extensionality axiom. In\nfact, prominent constructive and intuitionistic set theories turn out \nnot to possess the existence property, as discussed in the next section. \n\n\nLet \\(T\\) be a theory whose language, \\(L(T)\\), encompasses the\nlanguage of set theory. Moreover, for simplicity, we shall assume that\n\\(L(T)\\) has a constant \\(\\omega\\) denoting the set of von Neumann\nnatural numbers and for each \\(n\\) a constant \\(c_n\\) denoting the\n\\(n\\)-th element of \\(\\omega\\).\n\n\nA theory \\(T\\) has the disjunction property\n(DP) if whenever \\(T\\) proves \\((\\phi \\vee \\psi)\\) for sentences\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) of \\(L(T)\\), then \\(T\\) proves \\(\\phi\\) or\n\\(T\\) proves \\(\\psi\\).\n\n\nThe existence property has two distinct\nversions in the context of set theory: the numerical\nexistence property (NEP) and the existence\nproperty (EP). Let \\(\\theta(x)\\) be a formula with\nat most \\(x\\) free. We say that:\n(1) \\(T\\) has the NEP if whenever \\(T\\) proves\n\\(\\exists x \\in \\omega \\theta(x)\\), then, for some natural\nnumber \\(n, T\\) proves \\(\\theta(c_n)\\).\n\n\n\n(2) \\(T\\) has the EP if whenever \\(T\\) proves\n\\(\\exists x\\theta\\)(x), then there is a formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nwith exactly \\(x\\) free, so that \\(T\\) proves\n\\(\\exists !x(\\phi(x) \\wedge \\theta(x))\\).\n\n\n\nAs realisability techniques have proved crucial in investigations on\nthe existence and disjunction properties for constructive and\nintuitionistic set theories, we discuss the outcomes of these studies\nin the next section.\n5.3.2 Realisability\n\n\nRealisability has been one of the first and principal tools in the\nresearch surrounding set theories based on intuitionistic logic,\nstarting from the early contributions by Friedman and Myhill (Friedman\n1973, Myhill 1973). Realisability semantics for intuitionistic\narithmetic were first proposed by Kleene (Kleene 1945) and extended to\nhigher order Heyting arithmetic by Kreisel and Troelstra (Kreisel and\nTroelstra 1970). For the definition of realisability for arithmetic\nsee section 5.2 of the entry\non intuitionistic logic. A\nrealisability similar to Kreisel and Troelstra was applied to systems\nof higher order arithmetic by Friedman (Friedman 1973). Myhill\nintroduced a variant of this realisability which resembles Kleene\u2019s\nslash (Myhill 1973; Kleene 1962, 1963). He thus proved that a version\nof IZF with replacement in place of collection (called\nIZF\\(_{Rep})\\) has the DP, the NEP and the EP. These results were\nfurther extended in (Myhill 1975; Friedman and Scedrov 1983). While\nFriedman and Myhill gave realisability models for extensional set\ntheories, Beeson developed a notion of realisability for\nnon-extensional set theories. He then studied metatheoretical\nproperties of the extensional set theories via an interpretation in\ntheir non-extensional counterparts. He thus proved that IZF (with\ncollection) has the DP and NEP (Beeson 1985). Subsequently McCarty\nintroduced realisability for IZF directly for extensional set theory\n(McCarty 1984; 1986). Realisability semantics for variants of CZF have\nbeen considered, for example, in (Crosilla and Rathjen 2001; Rathjen\n2006a). The realisability in the latter article is inspired by\nMcCarty\u2019s and has the important feature that, as McCarty\u2019s for IZF, it\nis a self-validating semantics for CZF (that is, this notion of\nrealisability can be formalised in CZF and each theorem of CZF is\nrealised provably in CZF). Rathjen has made use of this notion of\nrealisability to show that CZF (and a number of extensions of it) have\nthe DP and the NEP (Rathjen 2005b).\n\nAnother kind of realisability that has proved very useful is Lifschitz\nrealisability. Lifschitz (1979) introduced a modification of Kleene\u2019s\nrealizability for Heyting arithmetic which has the peculiarity of\nvalidating a weak form of Church\u2019s Thesis (CT) with a uniqueness\ncondition, but not CT itself. Lifschitz realisability was extended to\nsecond order arithmetic by van Oosten (1990). It was subsequently\nextended to full IZF by Cheng and Rathjen, who employed it to obtain a\nnumber of independence results, as well as validating the so called\nLesser Limited Principle of Omniscience (LLPO) (for LLPO see the entry\non \n constructive mathematics).\nThe question of which set theories satisfy the existence property turned out to be particularly difficult to solve. (Friedman and\nScedrov 1985) used Kripke models to show that IZF (that is, the system\nwith collection) does not have the EP, while as mentioned above, the\nsystem IZF\\(_{Rep}\\) (which has replacement in place of\ncollection) does have the EP. This prompted Beeson to pose the\nquestion [Beeson 1985, IX]:\nDoes any reasonable set theory with collection have the existence property?\nA first answer to Beeson\u2019s question came with (Rathjen 2012), where\nthe author introduced the notion of weak existence property:\nthe focus here is finding a provably definable\nset of witnesses for every existential theorem. He then\nintroduced a form of realizability based on general set recursive\nfunctions, where a realizer for an existential statement provides a\nset of witnesses for the existential quantifier, rather than\na single witness. Rathjen combined this notion of realizability with\ntruth to yield that a number of theories with collection do enjoy the\nweak existence property (while IZF does not). Among them, in\nparticular, the theory CZF without subset collection plus Myhill\u2019s\nexponentiation axiom, CZF\\(_{Exp}\\). In fact, Rathjen claimed that\nby combining these results with further work he had carried out, he\ncould show that CZF\\(_{Exp}\\) (and a number of other theories) do\nhave the existence property. A striking observation is that these theories are formulated with collection; consequently the failure\nof the existence property in the case of IZF can not be attributed\nonly to collection, but to the interplay between this scheme and\nunrestricted separation.\nAs to the prominent question of whether\nCZF itself has the existence property, this has been solved in the\nnegative by Swan (2014). There the author made use of three well\ndevised realisability models and embeddings between them, to show that\neven the weak existence property fails for CZF. In so doing he also\nshowed that CZF\u2019s subset collection schema is the culprit. As clearly\nhighlighted in (Swan 2014) the fact that CZF does not have EP does not\nindicate some weakness in CZF as a constructive theory. Even if Swan\nproved essentially that CZF asserts the existence of mathematical\nobjects that it does not know how to construct, still CZF does have\nnatural interpretations in which these objects can be constructed,\nlike, for example, Aczel\u2019s interpretation into type theory (Aczel\n1978).\n\nFor a survey of results in intuitionistic set theory see (Beeson 1985,\nChapter IX). For the corresponding developments in CZF, see (Rathjen\n2005b, 2006, 2012) and (Swan 2014).\n5.3.3 Kripke models and Heyting-valued semantics\n\n\nKripke models for intuitionistic set theories have been used \nin (Friedman and Scedrov 1985) to show that IZF does not have the EP (and\ncombining this with the results in (Myhill 1973) we have that\nIZF\\(_{Rep}\\) does not prove IZF). Kripke models have more\nrecently been applied to clarify the relation between the constructive\nsubstitutes of the power set axiom: Myhill\u2019s exponentiation axiom and\nAczel\u2019s subset collection schema. It is clear that the power set axiom\nimplies both of these principles, and that subset collection implies\nexponentiation. On the other hand, each of the latter two principles \ndoes not imply power set, as the theory CZF with power set in place of subset \ncollection is much stronger \nthan CZF and CZF\\(_{Exp}\\) (Rathjen 2012b). In fact, CZF and\nCZF\\(_{Exp}\\) have the same proof theoretic strength (Griffor and\nRathjen 1994); therefore to investigate the relation between \nsubset collection and exponentiation in constructive set theory \none needed to develop tools other then proof theoretic methods. \nLubarsky (2005) used Kripke models to\nshow that Myhill\u2019s exponentiation axiom does not imply Aczel\u2019s\nsubset collection (on the basis of CZF minus subset collection plus\nfull separtion). In (Lubarsky and Rathjen 2007) the authors applied the\ntechnique of Kripke models to show that also the consequences of the\ntheories CZF and CZF\\(_{Exp}\\) are different. Aczel and Rathjen\n(2001) had shown that the class of Dedekind real numbers forms a set in CZF, \nby using subset collection. Lubarsky and Rathjen (2007) showed that\nCZF\\(_{Exp}\\) does not suffice to prove the same statement. For\nfurther applications of Kripke models to separating crucial constructive \nnotions, see e.g. (Diener and Lubarsky 2013).\n \n\nHeyting-valued semantics for intuitionistic set theories were obtained\nby Grayson (Grayson 1979) as a counterpart for Boolean models for\nclassical set theory. They have been generalized especially via\ncategorical semantics (for an introduction see MacLane and Moerdijk 1992). \nHeyting-valued semantics \nhave found application to independence\nresults in (Scedrov 1981; 1982). A constructive treatment has been\ngiven in (Gambino 2006). See also (Lubarsky 2009). \nSee also Ziegler (2012) for a generalization of realisability and Heyting models for constructive set theory. \n5.3.4 Categorical models of constructive and intuitionistic set theory\n\n\nCategorical models of constructive and intuitionistic set theories\nhave flourished over the years. \nThe notions of topos and sheaf play an \nessential role here (see e.g. Fourman 1980 and Fourman and\nScott 1980). For an overview of the main concepts, see the entry on\n category theory and the references\nprovided there (see in particular the supplement\n Programmatic Reading Guide). \nFor recent developments that relate more\nspecifically to constructive set theories, see e.g. (Simpson\n2005) and (Awodey 2008), as well as the web page:\n algebraic set theory.\n5.4 Variants of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theories: Set Theories with Urelements and Non-extensional Set Theories\n\n\nSometimes systems of intuitionistic and constructive set theory have\nbeen presented with the natural numbers as a separate sort of\nurelements, that is, primitive objects with no elements (Friedman 1977; \nMyhill 1975; Beeson 1985). Constructively, this is a\nnatural choice which is in agreement with ideas expressed, for example, by\nBishop (1967) (among others). In Bishop\u2019s monograph the natural\nnumbers are taken as a fundamental concept on which all the\nother mathematical concepts are based. From a technical\npoint of view, if the natural numbers are taken as primitive and\ndistinct from their set-theoretic representations, the axiom of\ninfinity then takes the form: \u201cthere is a set of natural numbers\n(as urelements)\u201d. A more general form of urelements in\nconstructive set theories have been considered in (Cantini and Crosilla\n2008). Here a variant of constructive set theory is proposed which combines \nan intensional and partial notion of operation with CZF\u2019s extensional notion of set \n(see also Cantini and Crosilla 2010).\n\n\nThe axiom of extensionality is a common feature of all the systems\ndiscussed so far. However, in a context in which the computational\ncontent of a statement is considered to be crucial, an intensional\ntheory might be more appropriate. For example, constructive type theory and\nexplicit mathematics both encapsulate some form of\nintensionality. Intuitionistic set theories without extensionality\nhave been considered in the literature (Friedman 1973a, Beeson 1985). \nTheir motivation, however, has been not computational\nbut technical in nature, due to the difficulties that extensionality \nbrings about when studying metamathematical properties of intuitionistic set \ntheories. \n",
