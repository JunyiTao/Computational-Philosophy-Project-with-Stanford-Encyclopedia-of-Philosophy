    "main_text": "\n\nOne common understanding of formalism in the philosophy of mathematics\ntakes it as holding that mathematics is not a body of propositions\nrepresenting an abstract sector of reality but is much more akin to a\ngame, bringing with it no more commitment to an ontology of objects or\nproperties than ludo or chess. This idea has some intuitive\nplausibility: consider the tyro toiling at multiplication tables or\nthe student using a standard algorithm for differentiating or\nintegrating a function. It also corresponds to some aspects of the\npractice of advanced mathematicians in some periods\u2014for example,\nthe treatment of imaginary numbers for some time after\nBombelli\u2019s introduction of them, and perhaps the attitude of\nsome contemporary mathematicians towards the higher flights of set\ntheory. Finally, it is often the position to which philosophically\nna\u00efve respondents will gesture towards, when pestered by\nquestions as to the nature of mathematics. Not surprisingly then, many\nphilosophers of mathematics view \u201cgame formalism\u201d as\nhopelessly implausible. This article is concerned with game formalism,\nits close relatives and with later developments, many of which have\ntried to overcome the perceived limitations of the cruder\nvarieties.\n",
