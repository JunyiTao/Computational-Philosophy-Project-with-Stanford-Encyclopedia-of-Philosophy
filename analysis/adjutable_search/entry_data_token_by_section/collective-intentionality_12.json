    "main_text": "Specific Issues || Team Reasoning\n4.3 Team Reasoning\n\nCoordination is a basic social phenomenon. It comes into play when\nthere are two or more agents each of which has two or more options\nwhich are known to the agents to be interdependent in such a way that\nit does not matter so much to any individual participant which option\nis chosen, just as long as all agents converge on one option.\nCoordination usually involves conventions. Driving on the right side\nmay not per se be seen as preferable to driving on the left\nside, but all rational participants in motorized traffic easily agree\nthat there needs to be some convention here, and observe it in\npractice. If in situations of pure coordination (with no conflict of\ninterest) there is a convention, it seems natural to say that it is\nrational for the participants to act accordingly.\n\nSurprisingly, classical game theory fails to support this intuition.\nFrom a classical game theoretical point of view, the fact that the\nright-side traffic rule is common knowledge between agents does not\nmake it rational to act accordingly. All that can be said is that it\nis rational for A to stick to the convention if A\nexpects the other to stick to the convention, too. However, the\nsame holds true for a violation of the convention. If A\nexpects B to violate the convention, it is rational for\nhim to do likewise in order to avoid a collision. As there is common\nknowledge of rationality, however, A knows that B will\nstick to the convention only if he or she expects A to do\nlikewise. Thus the condition cannot be settled, and the assertoric\njudgment that it is better to stick to the convention cannot be\nderived from the hypothetical judgment that this is the thing to do if\nthe other does so as well. As the rational choice, classical game\ntheory recommends a mixed strategy in such situations, which is\nremarkably bad advice for real life, and luckily descriptively\ninadequate.\n\nOne might think that rational coordination is made easier for the\nagents posited in game theoretic models if deviation from the\nconvention is sanctioned (e.g., by fines inflicted on those drivers\nwhich violate the traffic rule). In that case, there is typically one\ncoordination equilibrium which is better for both, and another\ncoordination equilibrium which is worse for both, but still better as\nfailures to coordinate. Yet this does surprisingly little to change\nthe situation from a classical game-theoretic point of view. In fact,\nthis shifts the recommended mixed strategy somewhat into the direction\nof more frequent selection of violation of the convention.\n\nA series of authors have argued that this reveals a fundamental flaw\nin the game-theoretic setting and appeals to collective\nintentionality have persistently been made in this context. The idea\nis that agents may choose from a joint perspective; they do not\nconsider what\u2019s best for them, individually, given the\nother\u2019s expected choice, but look at such situations with an eye\non what\u2019s best for them, jointly. One way of putting\nthis is to say that the failure of the classical model is to assume an\nidentity of the chooser that is fixed on the individual rather than\nseeing the identity of the chooser as variable. Michael Bacharach\n(2006), Robert Sugden (1993, 2000) and Martin Hollis (1998) have\ndeveloped corresponding accounts. In contrast to the\nliterature on collective intentionality, these accounts focus on ways\nof reasoning rather than forms of intention, or mental attitudes.\nHowever, these approaches can be seen as complementary to each other\n(Hakli, Miller & Tuomela 2010; see also Petersson 2016). Gold and\nSugden (2007) criticize Tuomela\u2019s, Bratman\u2019s,\nSearle\u2019s and Gilbert\u2019s accounts of collective\nintentionality, arguing that focusing on mental states or attitudes\nrather than modes of reasoning makes it impossible to see what is\ngenuinely collective about collective intentions. In their view,\ncollective intentions are the product of we-reasoning\u2014a view\nthat is challenged by the phenomenon of spontaneous joint intentions,\nand perhaps by the circularity problem that team reasoning already\nsupposes some sense of doing something together.\n",
