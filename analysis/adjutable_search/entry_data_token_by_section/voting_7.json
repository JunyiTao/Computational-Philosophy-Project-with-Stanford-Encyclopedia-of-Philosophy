    "main_text": "Moral Obligations Regarding How One Votes || The Expressivist Ethics of Voting\n3.1 The Expressivist Ethics of Voting\n\nRecall that one important theory of voting behavior holds that most\ncitizens vote not in order to influence the outcome of the election or\ninfluence government policies, but in order to express themselves (G.\nBrennan and Lomasky 1993). They vote to signal to themselves and to\nothers that they are loyal to certain ideas, ideals, or groups. For\ninstance, I might vote Democrat to signal that I\u2019m compassionate\nand fair, or Republican to signal I\u2019m responsible, moral, and\ntough. If voting is primarily an expressive act, then perhaps the\nethics of voting is an ethics of expression (G. Brennan and Lomasky\n1993: 167\u2013198). We can assess the morality of voting by asking\nwhat it says about a voter that she voted like that: \n\nTo cast a Klan ballot is to identify oneself in a morally\nsignificant way with the racist policies that the organization\nespouses. One thereby lays oneself open to associated moral liability\nwhether the candidate has a small, large, or zero probability of\ngaining victory, and whether or not one\u2019s own vote has an\nappreciable likelihood of affecting the election result. (G. Brennan\nand Lomasky 1993: 186)\n\n\nThe idea here is that if it\u2019s wrong (even if it\u2019s within\nmy rights) in general for me to express sincere racist attitudes, and\nso it\u2019s wrong for me to express sincere racist commitments at\nthe polls. Similar remarks apply to other wrongful attitudes. To the\nextent it is wrong for me to express sincere support for illiberal,\nreckless, or bad ideas, it would also be wrong for me to vote for\ncandidates who support those ideas.\n\nOf course, the question of just what counts as wrongful and\npermissible expression is complicated. There is also a complicated\nquestion of just what voting expresses. What I think my vote expresses\nmight be different from what it expresses to others, or it might be\nthat it expresses different things to different people. The\nexpressivist theory of voting ethics acknowledges these difficulties,\nand replies that whatever we would say about the ethics of expression\nin general should presumably apply to expressive voting.\n",
