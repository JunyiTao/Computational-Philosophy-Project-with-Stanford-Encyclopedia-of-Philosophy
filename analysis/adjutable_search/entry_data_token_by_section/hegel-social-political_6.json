    "main_text": "Property\n3. Property\n\nThe first substantive stage is Abstract Right. Somewhat misleading\nits sections are entitled \u201cProperty,\u201d\n\u201cContract\u201d and \u201cWrong\u201d giving the false\nimpression that Hegel is discussing actual possession of property, its\nsale or punishment for breach of contract. Typically for Hegel, he uses\ncommon terminology in uncommon ways.\n\nWe must recall the main aim of Hegel\u2019s project is to\nunderstand how the free will wills the free will, and not mere\narbitrariness. This requires Hegel to find some ground for helping\ndecide when the free will wills freely, versus when it does not. Hegel\nfirst turns to taking possession of property. It is noticeable that\nHegel\u2019s account is aimed at using property possession as a first\nstep towards finding this ground rather than for building an economic\nsystem. For example, Hegel says that \u201cwhat and how much I possess\nis\u2026purely contingent as far as right is concerned\u201d\n(PR \u00a749). This is because Hegel does not intend to\ndevelop a full theory of property yet, but rather to locate a ground\nfor the free will\u2019s freedom.\n\nThe importance of property at this stage is its development of our\nself-consciousness (Benhabib 1984). For Hegel, I give my free will an\nexternal existence that others can engage with. My ownership of\nproperty is not determined by me alone, but something determined\n\u201cwithin the context of a common will\u201d shared between two\npersons (PR \u00a771).\n\nHegel calls the mutual recognition between two persons about\nproperty ownership a \u201ccontract\u201d (PR \u00a771\u201375).\nThis is no ordinary contract. The context in Abstract Right is a\nhypothetical space of two persons. There is no money or sale of goods.\nThe \u201ccontract\u201d is not a written agreement. All common\nterminology, but given different usages.\n\nThe key point, for Hegel, is that only the free will of an\nindividual can ground the free will of another (Stillman 1980).\nSomething is mine when mutually recognized as my possession by another.\nThis is the first appearance of right where the activity of my free\nwill in taking possession is free, and not mere arbitrariness. It is\nthis agreement between two individuals forming a kind of contract which\nis so important for Hegel. This is because mutual recognition becomes a\nvehicle for how we can develop further a more concrete understanding of\nfreedom as right in the world. If such recognition was under threat,\nthis would unsettle how we can ground our free will in a free will of\nanother.\n",
