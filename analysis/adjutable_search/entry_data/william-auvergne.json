    "preamble": "\n\nWilliam of Auvergne or Paris, (ca.1180/90\u20131249), Bishop of Paris\nfrom 1228 until his death in 1249, was one of the first wave of\nthinkers in the Latin West to engage with the writings on natural\nphilosophy and metaphysics by Greek, Islamic and Jewish thinkers that\nhad recently become available in Latin translation. William took these\nwritings to pose errors dangerous to the Christian faith, and his\nphilosophical works are in large part aimed at combating their errors.\nYet at the same time he recognized their philosophical value and,\nthough often confused about their meaning, incorporated their\nteachings into his own thought. On many of the important issues of\nlater medieval thought, William is the first to provide in-depth\ndiscussions, and his voluminous works are an important and still\nunder-appreciated source for our understanding of the development of\nmedieval philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nAs with so many important medieval figures, we know little about\nWilliam\u2019s early years. According to one manuscript source, he\nwas born in Aurillac, in the province of Auvergne in south-central\nFrance. His birth date is unknown, but since he was a professor of\ntheology at the University of Paris by 1225, a position rarely\nattained before the age of 35, he is not likely to have been born\nlater than 1190, and scholars have placed his probable birth date some\ntime between 1180 and 1190. He may have come from a poor background,\nas the Dominican, Stephen of Bourbon (died c. 1261), tells a story of\nWilliam begging as a young child (Valois 1880, 4). He was a canon of\nNotre Dame and a master of theology by 1223, and is mentioned in bulls\nof Pope Honorius III in 1224 and 1225.\n\nThe story of his elevation to the episcopacy in 1228 paints a picture\nof a man of great determination and self-confidence. The previous year\nthe Bishop of Paris, Bartholomeus, had died, and the canons of the\nchapter of Notre Dame met to select his successor. The initial\nselection of a cantor named Nicholas did not secure unanimous\nagreement and was contested, in particular, by William. Nicholas\nexcused himself, and the canons went on to choose the Dean of the\nCathedral. William again contested the election and went to Rome to\nappeal to the Pope to vacate it. He made a favorable impression, for\nthe Pope, impressed by his \u201ceminent knowledge and spotless\nvirtue,\u201d as he put it (Valois 1880, 11), both ordained him\npriest and made him Bishop of Paris, a position he retained until his\ndeath in 1249.\n\nIt was not long before the Pope would have regrets. In February 1229 a\nnumber of students were killed by the forces of the queen-regent,\nBlanche of Castile, when they intervened in a drunken student riot\nduring Carnival. Outraged, the masters and students appealed to\nWilliam for redress of their rights, but William failed to take\naction. The students and masters went on strike, dispersing from Paris\nand appealing to Pope Gregory IX. It was apparently during this period\nthat William gave the Dominicans their first chair in theology at the\nuniversity. The Pope, who was to remark that he regretted\n\u201chaving made this man,\u201d rebuked William, appointed a\ncommission to settle the dispute, and ordered William to reinstate the\nstriking masters. Nevertheless, William went on to receive important\nmissions from the Pope in subsequent years, acting, for example, as a\npapal representative in peace negotiations between France and England\nin 1231.\n\nIn 1239 William was closely involved in the condemnation of the\nTalmud. The Pope had asked him for his response to a list of heresies\nin the Talmud proposed by a converted Jew, Nicholas. William\u2019s\nresponse led to a papal bull ordering the confiscation of sacred books\nfrom synagogues in 1240, and to their burning in 1242 (for details,\nsee Valois 1880, Smith 1992 and de Mayo 2007).\n\nWilliam died at the end of March (the exact date is unsure) in 1249,\nand was buried in the Abbey of St. Victor.\n2. Works\n\nWilliam\u2019s most important philosophical writings form part of a\nvast seven-part work he calls the Magisterium divinale et\nsapientiale, a title Teske translates as Teaching on God in\nthe Mode of Wisdom. The Magisterium is generally taken\nto consist of the following seven works in the order given:\n\nDe Trinitate, sive de primo principio (On the\nTrinity, or the First Principle)\nDe universo (On the Universe)\nDe anima (On the Soul)\nCur Deus homo (Why God Became Man)\nDe fide et legibus (On Faith and Laws)\nDe sacramentis (On the Sacraments)\nDe virtutibus et moribus (On Virtues and\nMorals).\n\n\nWilliam did not compose the parts of the Magisterium in their\nrational order, and appears to have developed his conception of its\nstructure as he wrote its various parts. He viewed it as having two\nprincipal parts. The first part is comprised of De Trinitate,\nDe universo, and De anima. In this, the most\nphilosophical part of the Magisterium, William proceeds by\n\u201cthe paths of proofs\u201d or philosophizing rather than by an\nappeal to the authority of revelation. He intends to combat a range of\nphilosophical errors incompatible, as he sees it, with the Christian\nfaith. In On the Trinity he develops his metaphysics,\nattacking, among others, errors regarding creation, divine freedom and\nthe eternity of the world, and follows it with a philosophical\ntreatment of the Trinity. William\u2019s vast work, On the\nUniverse, is divided into two principal parts. The first part\n(Ia, i.e. prima pars) is concerned with the corporeal\nuniverse and is in turn divided into three parts, the first (Ia-Iae,\ni.e. prima pars primae partis) arguing for a single first\nprinciple and for the oneness of the universe, the second (IIa-Iae)\ntaking up the question of the beginning of the universe and its future\nstate, and the third (IIIa-Iae) treating the governance of the\nuniverse through God\u2019s providence. The second principal part\n(IIa) is concerned with the spiritual universe, and is divided into\nthree parts concerning, respectively, the intelligences or spiritual\nbeings posited by Aristotle and his followers (Ia-IIae), the good and\nholy angels (IIa-IIae), and the bad and wicked angels, that is, demons\n(IIIa-IIae). On the Soul is concerned with the human soul. It\nis divided into seven parts concerning, respectively, its existence,\nits essence, its composition, the number of souls in a human being,\nhow the human soul comes into being, the state of the soul in the\nbody, and the soul\u2019s relation to God, with a focus on the human\nintellect.\n\nThe works comprising the second part of the Magisterium are\nmore expressly theological in nature and appeal to the authority of\nrevelation. Nevertheless, William continually recurs to his\nphilosophical doctrines in all his works, and even his most\ntheological writings contain material of considerable philosophical\ninterest. In particular, his treatises On Virtues and Morals\nand On Faith and Laws are of great importance for his moral\nphilosophy.\n\nScholars agree that On the Trinity is the earliest work in\nthe Magisterium and that it was probably written in the early\n1220s. The other works can be partially dated by references to\ncontemporaneous events, though the sheer size of many individual works\nsuggests they were probably written over a period of years. The whole\nMagisterium itself was probably written during a period\nextending from the early 1220s to around 1240, with On the\nUniverse written in the 1230s and On the Soul completed\nby around 1240.\n\nBesides the works contained in the Magisterium, other works\nof philosophical importance are De bono et malo I (On\nGood and Evil), where William develops a theory of value; De\nimmortalitate animae (On the Immortality of the\nSoul), a companion to the treatment of immortality in On the\nSoul; and De gratia et libero arbitrio (On Grace and\nFree Choice), a treatment of the Pelagian heresy.\n\nIn addition, William wrote some biblical commentaries, a number of\nother major theological works, and a large number of sermons (for\ndetails, see Ottman 2005). The more than 550 sermons that can be\nattributed to William have recently been critically edited by F.\nMorenzoni; they comprise four volumes in the Corpus\nChristianorum series (Opera homiletica, CCCM\n230\u2013230C).\n\nWith the exception of the sermons, most of William\u2019s works have\nnot been critically edited; several are extant only in manuscript\nform. The standard edition, which includes all the works that comprise\nthe Magisterium, is the 1674 Orl\u00e9ans-Paris Opera\nomnia (OO). (The sermons contained in this edition are by William\nPerrauld, not William of Auvergne.) As might be expected, the texts in\nthis old edition are often in need of correction; Teske has\nconjectured many corrections in his translations.\n3. The Character of William\u2019s Philosophical Works\n\nThe reader of William\u2019s philosophical works is struck by their\ndifference in character from the mainstream of philosophical and\ntheological writing of the early thirteenth century. Whereas\nWilliam\u2019s contemporaries tend to compose works as a series of\nlinked questions, each treated according to the question method (a\nparadigm of which is Aquinas\u2019s later Summa theologiae),\nWilliam instead follows the practice of Avicenna and Avicebron and\ncomposes treatises much more akin to a modern book. Indeed, William\neven models his writing style to some degree on the Latin translations\nof these authors. These features, together with William\u2019s\nfrequent use of analogies, metaphors and examples drawn from everyday\nlife, his long-winded, rambling prose and frequent digressions, his\nharsh assessments of opponents as imbeciles or morons, and his urging\nthat proponents of dangerous doctrines be wiped out by fire and sword,\nmake for an inimitable and immediately recognizable style.\n\nOne of the costs of this style, however, is that at times it can be\nhard to tell precisely what William thinks. Too often he lets\nmetaphors or analogies bear the argumentative burden in lieu of more\ncareful analysis. And while William\u2019s inventive mind could\ngenerate arguments for a position with ease, their quality is uneven:\noften he proposes problematic arguments without appearing to recognize\nthe difficulties they contain, as may be apparent below to the\ndiscerning reader, while at other times he shows an acute awareness of\nthe fundamental problems an issue raises.\n4. Sources\n\nWilliam was one of the first thinkers in the Latin West to begin to\nengage seriously with Aristotle\u2019s writings on metaphysics and\nnatural philosophy and with the thought of Islamic and Jewish\nthinkers, especially Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, 980\u20131037) and\nAvicebron (Solomon Ibn Gabirol, 1021/2\u20131057/8) (see e.g.\nBertolacci 2012, Caster 1996c, de Vaux 1934 and Teske 1999). The works\nof these thinkers, which had been coming into circulation in Latin\ntranslations from around the middle of the twelfth century, presented\nboth philosophical sophistication and theological danger. Indeed, in\n1210, public and private lecturing on Aristotle\u2019s works on\nnatural philosophy and commentaries on them was forbidden at Paris,\nand in 1215 the papal legate, Cardinal Robert of Cour\u00e7on\nforbade \u201cmasters in arts from \u2018reading,\u2019 i.e.,\nlecturing, on Aristotle\u2019s books on natural philosophy along with\nthe Metaphysics and Summae of the same (probably\ncertain works of Avicenna and perhaps of Alfarabi)\u201d (Wippel\n2003, 66). This prohibition remained in effect until it unofficially\nlapsed around 1231. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that personal\nstudy of these texts had not been forbidden, and William clearly\nworked hard to master them. He came to be keenly aware of the\nincompatibility of much of the teaching of these works with Christian\ndoctrine, yet at the same time he found them to be a source of\nphilosophical inspiration, and his thought brims with ideas drawn from\nAvicenna and Avicebron. His attitude to these thinkers is expressed\nwell in a passage in On the Soul, where, regarding Aristotle,\nhe writes that:\n\nthough on many points one must contradict Aristotle, as is really\nright and proper\u2014and this holds for all the statements by which\nhe contradicts the truth\u2014he should be accepted in all those\nstatements in which he is found to have held the right view. (OO II\nsuppl., 82a; Teske 2000, 89)\n\n\nOf course, William was also strongly influenced by Christian thinkers.\nIn particular, his writings are permeated by the thought of Saint\nAugustine, whom William refers to as \u201cone of the more noble of\nChristian thinkers,\u201d if perhaps in a less obvious way than by\nthe thought of Avicenna. Indeed, as the list in Valois 1880,\n198\u2013206, attests, William employs a remarkable range of sources\nand must be reckoned one of the most well-read thinkers of his\nday.\n\nThe focus of the following outline is William\u2019s views on\nmetaphysics and the soul, but even within these limits the vast range\nof his thought has required that many issues in these areas not be\ntreated. In a future supplement, William\u2019s views on value theory\nand morality will be addressed. Teske\u2019s English translations are\nquoted whenever possible; otherwise, translations are my own (i.e. N.\nLewis\u2019s).\n5. Metaphysics\n\nWilliam is the first thinker in the Latin West to develop a systematic\nmetaphysics (as ontology) based on the concepts of being\n(esse) and essence (essentia). Influenced by\nBoethius and Avicenna, he develops this metaphysics in his early work,\nOn the Trinity, as a preliminary to his account of the\nTrinity, and he returns to it in other works, especially in On the\nUniverse. The central theme of his metaphysics is that all\nexisting things, besides God, are composites of essence, on the one\nhand, and their being or existence, on the other, which is said to be\nacquired or partaken from God, the source of all being. God, in\ncontrast, involves no composition of essence and being, but is his\nbeing.\n\nInspired by Boethius\u2019s distinction in De hebdomadibus\nbetween what is good by participation and what is good by substance,\nWilliam works these ideas out in terms of a distinction between a\nbeing by participation (ens participatione) and a being by\nsubstance or essence (ens substantia / ens per essentiam). By\nthe essence of a thing William means what is signified by its\ndefinition or species name. Under the influence of Avicenna, he often\nrefers to essence as a thing\u2019s quiddity (quidditas,\nliterally, \u201cwhatness\u201d), which he identifies with\nBoethius\u2019s notion of quod est or \u201cthat which\nis.\u201d Analogously, he identifies a thing\u2019s being\n(esse) or existence with the notion of quo est or\n\u201cby which it is.\u201d In the case of a being by participation,\nits essence and features incidental to the essence are distinct from\nits being; William describes its being as clothed by them or as what\nwould be left if they were stripped away. Such a being (ens)\nis said to participate in or acquire its being (esse). At\ntimes William, following Avicenna, speaks of its being as accidental\nto it, by which he just emphasizes that its being is not part of the\nessence.\n\nA being (ens) by substance, in contrast, does not participate\nin or acquire being but is its very being: \u201cthere is also the\nbeing whose essence is for it being (esse) and whose essence\nwe predicate when we say, \u2018It is,\u2019 so that it itself and\nits being (esse) \u2026 are one thing in every way\u201d\n(Switalski 1976, 17; Teske and Wade 1989, 65).\n\nIn the second chapter of On the Trinity, William also notes\nthat the term \u201cbeing\u201d (esse) may be used to mean\na thing\u2019s essence (similar to Avicenna\u2019s esse\nproprium), but this sense of \u201cbeing\u201d plays a minor\nrole in his thought.\n\nWilliam argues that there must be a being by essence; otherwise, no\nbeing could be intelligible. Thus, if there were just beings by\nparticipation, there would have to be either a circle of beings each\nof which participates in the being of what is prior to it in the\ncircle, with the absurd consequence that a thing would ultimately\nparticipate in its own being; or else there would have to be an\ninfinite series of beings, each member of which participates in the\nbeing of what is prior in the series. But then, for a member of the\nseries\u2014say, A\u2014to be, would be for it to have or\nparticipate in the being of B; and for B to be, in\nturn, would be for it to have or participate in the being of\nC, and so on. But if this were so, the being of no member of\nthe series could be intelligible, since any attempt to spell it out\nwould result in an account of the form: A\u2019s having\nB\u2019s having C\u2019s having ad\ninfinitum. Since being is intelligible, William concludes that\nthere is a being by essence.\n\nBesides the distinctions between being by participation and being by\nessence, William mentions sixteen other distinctions, including the\ndistinctions between being of need (esse indigentiae) and\nbeing of sufficiency (esse sufficientiae), possible being\n(esse possibile) and being necessary through itself (esse\nnecesse per se ipsum), false and true being, and flowing and\nlasting being. William takes these distinctions to be coextensive with\nthe distinction between being by participation and being by essence.\nUsing a form of argument drawn from Avicenna, he argues that given the\nfirst member of each distinction, we can prove the existence of the\nsecond (see On the Trinity, ch. 6).\n\nThe distinction between possible being (possibile esse) and\nnecessary being through itself (necesse esse per se ipsum),\nwhich William draws from Avicenna, plays a prominent role in\nWilliam\u2019s thought. William\u2019s notion of a possible is not\nthat of something that exists in some possible world, but is rather\nthe notion of something whose essence neither requires nor rules out\nits having being. William treats such possibles as in some sense prior\nto being. In the case of those that have being and thus actually\nexist, he holds that the possible \u201cand its being\n(esse), which does not belong to it essentially, are really\ntwo. The one comes to the other and does not fall within its\ndefinition or quiddity. Being (ens) [i.e., a being] in this\nway is, therefore, composite and also resolvable into its possibility,\nor quiddity, and its being (esse)\u201d (Switalski 1976, 44;\nTeske and Wade 1989, 87). Some commentators see in such remarks the\nidea that a real or mind-independent distinction obtains between being\nand essence in possible beings.\n\nIn contrast, the being and essence of a being necessary through itself\nare not two; such a being does not participate in being but is its\nbeing and cannot but exist.\n\nWilliam argues there can be only one being by substance or being\nnecessary through itself. Speaking from a metaphysical point of view,\nhe follows Avicenna and calls it the First (primum). Speaking\nas a Christian, he identifies it with God, the creator, as he thinks\nis indicated by Biblical references to God as \u201che who is\u201d:\n\u201cbeing,\u201d he says, is a proper name of God (see e.g. On\nthe Trinity, ch. 4).\n\nThe uniqueness of a being by substance is, William argues, a\nconsequence of its absolute simplicity, since nothing could\ndifferentiate two or more absolutely simple beings. The absolute\nsimplicity of a being by substance, in turn, is a consequence of the\nfact that it cannot be caused (not, at least by an external causation;\nWilliam argues that the being by substance is the Christian Trinity of\npersons and he admits a kind of internal causation in the Trinity).\nFor everything that is caused is other than its being and thus is a\nbeing by participation, whereas a being by essence or substance is its\nbeing. But a composite or non-simple being must have an external\ncause, and must therefore be a being by participation. Therefore, the\nbeing by substance, that is to say, God, cannot be composite, but must\nbe absolutely simple.\n\nGod\u2019s absolute simplicity also entails that he is neither a\nuniversal (i.e., neither a genus nor species), nor an individual\nfalling under such. For, William argues, genera and species are\nthemselves composite, and the individuals that fall under them have a\nquiddity or definition and therefore compositeness. Nevertheless,\nWilliam thinks God is an individual, since he holds that all that\nexists is either a universal or an individual (OO I, 855ab).\n\nWilliam appeals to God\u2019s power to show God has will and\nknowledge. He argues that God must be omnipotent: he cannot be forced\nor impeded and has a \u201ctwo-way\u201d power (potentia),\nidentified by William with what Aristotle calls a rational power. This\nis a power that \u201cextends to both opposites, namely, to make and\nnot to make\u201d (Switalski 1976, 57; Teske and Wade 1989, 99), in\ncontrast with something, such as fire, which when \u201cit encounters\nwhat can be heated is not able to heat or not to heat . . . but it\nnecessarily has only the power to heat\u201d (Switalski 1976, 54;\nTeske and Wade 1989, 97). However, because a two-way power is poised\nbetween acting and not-acting, it must be inclined to acting by\nsomething, and William thinks this can only be through a choice.\nTherefore, God must have will and choice; and since \u201cit is\nimpossible that there be will and choice where there is no\nknowledge\u201d (Switalski 1976, 59; Teske and Wade 1989, 101), God\nmust also have knowledge. William goes on to argue that God must\nindeed be omniscient, since \u201chis wisdom is absolute and free,\nnot bound in any way to things, nor dependent upon them\u201d\n(Switalski 1976, 61; Teske and Wade 1989, 102).\n\nWilliam takes his claim that God has a two-way power to imply that God\ncould have known or willed otherwise than he did. But, as William\nrealizes, this raises the difficulty that if God had known or willed\notherwise, it would seem that he would have been different, and this\nseems to be impossible given his absolute simplicity. In response,\nWilliam frequently emphasizes that by the very same act of knowing or\nwill by which God in fact knows or wills one thing, he could have\nknown or willed something else (OO I, 780a; Teske 2007, 105). Thus,\nwhen we say \u201cGod knows or wills X,\u201d we must distinguish\nthe act of knowing or willing, which is identical with God and utterly\nthe same in every possible situation, from the object X to which it is\nrelated.\n6. God\u2019s Relation to Creatures\n6.1 God as the Source of Being\n\nAccording to William, everything participates in or acquires its being\nfrom God. But just what he means by this is less than clear. At times,\nas in the following passage from On the Universe, he seems to\nsuggest that God is literally present in created things as their\nbeing:\n\nthe creator is next to and most present to each of his creatures; in\nfact, he is most interior to each of them. And this can be seen by you\nthrough the subtraction or stripping away of all the accidental and\nsubstantial conditions and forms. For when you subtract from each of\nthe creatures all these, last of all there is found being or entity,\nand on this account its giver. (OO I, 625b; Teske 1998a, 100)\n\n\nYet William realizes that such statements may give an incorrect\nimpression of his thought. Thus, at one point in On the\nUniverse he writes that \u201cevery substance includes, if\nit is proper to say so (si dici fas est), the\ncreator\u2019s essence within itself\u201d (OO I, 920b), and he goes\non to note that it is difficult to state clearly the sense in which\nthe creator is in creatures. In other passages he emphasizes\nGod\u2019s transcendence of creatures: \u201cthe first being\n(esse) is for all things the being (esse) by which\nthey are \u2026 It is one essence, pure, solitary, separate from and\nunmixed with all things.\u201d Often he appeals to an analogy with\nlight: the first being fills \u201call things like light cast over\nthe universe. By this filling or outpouring it makes all things\nreflect it. This is their being (esse), namely to reflect\nit\u201d (Switalski 1976, 45; Teske and Wade 1989, 89). William\nperhaps intends in such remarks to exploit the medieval view that a\npoint of light (lux) and the light emitted from that point\n(lumen), though distinct, nonetheless are also in some deep\nsense the same.\n6.2 Against the Manichees\n\nRegarding the procession of creatures from God, William is concerned\nto attack a range of errors. In On the Universe Ia-Iae he\nattacks the error of the Manichees. Though he refers to Mani, the\nthird-century originator of the Manichee sect, he seems chiefly\nconcerned with the Cathars of his day. The Manichees deny God is the\nultimate source of all things and instead posit two first principles,\none good and one evil. Only in this way, they think, can we explain\nthe presence of both good and evil in the world. William thinks a\nfundamental motivation for this view is the principle that \u201cfrom\none of two contraries the other cannot come of itself\u201d (OO I,\n602a; Teske 1998a, 54), and hence that evil cannot come from good but\nmust stem from its own first principle. He replies that although one\ncontrary cannot of itself (per se) be from the other, it is\nperfectly possible for it to be from the other incidentally (per\naccidens), and he gives everyday examples to illustrate. Thus,\n\u201cdrunkenness comes from wine. In that case it is evident that an\nevil comes from a good, unless one would say that wine is not\ngood\u201d (OO I, 602a; Teske 1998a, 54). Likewise, there is a sense\nin which evil is ultimately from God, though incidentally and not as\nsomething God aims at or intends as such. The evil of sin, for\nexample, is a consequence of God\u2019s creating creatures with free\nwill and permitting their misuse of it.\n\nWilliam offers a host of arguments against the possibility of two\nfirst principles. On metaphysical grounds, for example, he objects\nthat a first principle must be a being necessary through itself, and\nthat he has shown that a plurality of such beings is impossible. And\nhe gives arguments to the effect that the notion of a creative first\nevil principle is incoherent. Such a being, for example, could not do\ngood for anything, and hence could not have created anything, for in\ndoing so it would have done good for what it created (see also\nBernstein 2005 and Teske 1993a).\n6.3 Causation, and Creation by Intermediaries\n\nWilliam claims \u201cthe creator alone properly and truly is worthy\nof the title \u2018cause,\u2019 but other things are merely\nmessengers and bearers of the last things received as if sent from the\ncreator\u201d (OO I, 622a; Teske 1998a, 92). We speak of creatures as\ncauses, but William says this is \u201cad sensum\u201d\n(Switalski 1976, 79; Teske and Wade 1989, 117), that is, in respect of\nhow things appear in sense experience. Both medieval and contemporary\ncommentators have on the basis of such remarks attributed to William\nthe denial that creatures are genuine causes (see Reilly 1953).\nCertainly he denies that any creature can exercise fully independent\ncausal agency, a view he thinks \u201cthe philosophers\u201d have\nadopted. But this claim is compatible with admission of genuine\nsecondary causes that are reliant for their exercise of causation on\nthe simultaneous activity of prior causes, and ultimately on that of\nthe first cause, God. Is William simply making this point but using\nthe term \u201ccause\u201d in a more restricted manner than his\ncontemporaries? A negative answer is suggested by William\u2019s\nrationale for his usage. He thinks of causation as the giving of\nbeing, and he thinks that anything that receives being, and therefore\nall creatures, cannot itself give being but can merely transmit it.\nMoreover, his metaphors of creatures as riverbeds or windows through\nwhich the divine causal influence flows strongly suggest that he\nreally does wish to hold that creatures themselves do not really bring\nanything about but are simply the conduits through which divine\ncausality flows (see Miller 1998 and 2002).\n\nWhether in fact William admits genuine causal agency among creatures,\nhe clearly thinks that God alone can create from nothing. Thus, he\nrejects Avicenna\u2019s so-called \u201cemanationist\u201d doctrine\nof creation, according to which, as he puts it, God creates from\nnothing only one thing, the first intelligence (or spiritual being),\nwhich in turn creates the next intelligence, and so on until the tenth\nor agent intelligence is reached, the creator of souls and the\nsensible world. William thinks one ground of this doctrine is\nAvicenna\u2019s principle that \u201cfrom what is one in so far as\nit is one there cannot in any way come anything but what is one\u201d\n(ex uno, secundum quod unum, non potest esse ullo modorum nisi\nunum) (OO I, 618b; Teske 1998a, 82), and hence from God, who is\nabsolutely one, can at most come one thing. In fact, William agrees\nwith this principle and applies it in the context of Trinitarian\ntheology, but he thinks Avicenna has misapplied it by using it to\nexplain creation. Instead, William follows the Jewish thinker\nAvicebron (whom he thought was a Christian) and holds that creatures\ncome from God not insofar as he is one, but \u201cthrough his will\nand insofar as he wills, just as a potter does not shape clay vessels\nthrough his oneness, but through his will\u201d (OO I, 624a; Teske\n1998a, 96).\n6.4 Against the Necessity of Creation\n\nWilliam thinks the will is necessarily free; thus the fact that God\ncreates through his will means that creation is an exercise of\nGod\u2019s free will. This point serves to undermine another aspect\nof Avicenna\u2019s doctrine of the procession of creatures from God.\nFor Avicenna posits not only a series of creators, but also holds that\nthis procession is utterly necessary: the actual world must exist and\ncould not have been other than it is. William thinks this conclusion\nstems from a failure to grasp God\u2019s freedom in creation.\nAvicenna and others imposed \u201cnot only necessity, but natural\nservitude upon the creator, supposing that he operates in the manner\nof nature\u201d (OO I, 614b; Teske 1998a, 72). Thus, they think the\nuniverse issued from God as brightness issues from the sun or heat\nfrom fire, and that God no more had it in his power to do otherwise\nthan do the sun or heat. Against this William argues that it is a\nconsequence of God\u2019s free creation that he had it in his power\nto create otherwise than he did.\n6.5 Against the Eternity of the World\n\nOne of the most contentious doctrines presented by Greek and Islamic\nphilosophy to thinkers in the early thirteenth century is that of the\neternity of the world, the view that the world had no beginning but\nexisted over an infinite past. This view seems to contradict the\nopening words of the Bible: \u201cIn the beginning God created heaven\nand earth.\u201d In response, a number of thinkers in the early\nthirteenth century, including the Franciscan Alexander of Hales,\nargued that Aristotle, at least, had been misunderstood and had never\nproposed the eternity of the world. But William, like his Oxford\ncontemporary, Robert Grosseteste, would have none of this:\n\u201cWhatever may be said and whoever may try to excuse Aristotle,\nit was undoubtedly his opinion that the world is eternal and that it\ndid not begin to be, and he held the same view concerning motion.\nAvicenna held this after him\u201d (OO I, 690b; Teske 1998a,\n117).\n\nThe importance of this issue to William is indicated by the space he\ndevotes to it. His treatment of the question of the eternity\naeternitas of the world in On the Universe IIa-Iae\nis one of the longest discussions of the issue in the middle ages, and\nthe first substantial treatment to be made in the light of Greek and\nIslamic thought.\n\nWilliam thinks, in fact, that to call the world eternal in the\naforementioned sense is not to use the term \u201ceternal\u201d in\nits strictest sense. Accordingly, he starts by explaining different\nsenses of the term in the first extended treatment of the distinction\nbetween eternity and time in the middle ages. He then presents and\nrefutes arguments that the world has no beginning, and provides his\nown positive arguments that the world must have a temporal beginning,\na first instant of its existence.\n\nWilliam\u2019s chief aim in his treatment of time and eternity is to\nemphasize the fundamental differences between eternity and time. He is\nespecially concerned to attack a conception of eternity as existence\nat every time, a conception he attributes to Aristotle. In his view,\neternity in a strict sense is proper to the creator alone and is his\nvery being, though \u201cthe name \u2018eternity\u2019 says more\nthan his being, namely, the privations of beginning and ending, as\nwell as of flux and change, and this both in act and in potency\u201d\n(OO I, 685b\u2013686a; Teske 1998a, 109). The fundamental difference\nbetween time and eternity is that \u201cas it is proper and essential\nto time to flow or cease to be, so it is proper and essential to\neternity to remain and stand still\u201d (OO I, 683b; Teske 1998a,\n102). William, like other medieval thinkers, tends to describe\neternity in terms of what it is not. It has nothing that flows and\nhence no before or after or parts. Its being is whole at once, not\nbecause it all exists at one time, but because it all exists with\nnothing temporally before or after it. William speaks of duration in\neternity, but he holds that the term has a different (unfortunately\nunexplained) sense in this context than when applied to time.\n\nWilliam had read Aristotle\u2019s Physics and agrees with\nAristotle that time and motion are coextensive (OO I, 700a). Yet he\ndoes not propose Aristotle\u2019s definition of time as the number of\nmotion in respect of before and after. Rather, in his account of the\nessential nature of time he describes time simply as being that flows\nand does not last, \u201cthat is, it has nothing of itself that lasts\nin act or potency\u201d (OO I, 683a; Teske 1998a, 102). Echoing\nAristotle and Augustine, he holds that time has the weakest being, and\nthat \u201cof all things that are said to be in any way, time is the\nmost remote from eternity, and this is because it only touches\neternity by the very least of itself, the now itself or a point of\ntime\u201d (OO I, 748a).\n\nWilliam introduces his account of the eternity of the world in On\nthe Universe by reference to Aristotle, but he devotes the bulk\nof his discussion to Avicenna\u2019s arguments for this doctrine. In\nparallel material in On the Trinity he claims that at the\nroot of Avicenna\u2019s view lies the principle that \u201cif the\none essence is now as it was before when nothing came forth from it,\nsomething will not now come forth from it\u201d (Switalski 1976, 69;\nTeske and Wade 1989, 108). That is, nothing new is caused to exist\nunless there is a change in the cause. Thus God, a changeless being,\ncannot start to create the world after not creating it; and therefore\nhe must have created it from eternity and without a beginning.\nTherefore, the world must itself lack a beginning.\n\nWilliam replies that Avicenna\u2019s principle leads to an infinite\nregress; for if something\u2019s operating after not operating\nrequires a change in it, this change will itself require a new cause,\nand that new cause will itself require a new cause, and so on ad\ninfinitum. William instead holds that it is possible that God,\nwithout changing in any way, start to operate after not operating.\nWhat William means by this is that the effect of God\u2019s eternal\nwill is a world with a temporal beginning. In general, he holds that\nverbs such as \u201ccreate\u201d express nothing in the creator\nhimself but rather something in things. We might put \u201cGod begins\nto create the world\u201d to have the import of: \u201cGod by an\neternal willing creates the world, and the world has a\nbeginning.\u201d\n\nWilliam emphasizes that God does not will that the world exist without\nqualification, but rather that it exist with a given temporal\nstructure, namely, a beginning (Switalski 1976, 67\u201368; Teske and\nWade 1989, 107). This might suggest that he thinks God might in fact\nhave created a world without a beginning, but chose not to do so, as\nAquinas would hold. But in fact, William argues that this option was\nnot open to God: a world without a beginning is simply not a creatable\nitem. William attempts to establish this point by a host of arguments,\nmany of which are found in his writings for the first time in the\nLatin West and repeated by later thinkers such as Bonaventure and\nHenry of Ghent. On the whole, these arguments either allege that the\nnotion of a created thing itself entails that what is created has a\ntemporal beginning or point to alleged paradoxes stemming from the\nsupposition of an infinite past.\n\nFor example, William argues (OO I, 696b; Teske 1998a, 133) that\nbecause the world in itself is merely a possible, in itself it is in\nnon-being and non-being is therefore natural to it. Hence its\nnon-being, being natural to it, is prior to its being, and therefore\nin being created it must receive being after non-being, and thus have\na beginning.\n\nAmong arguments involving infinity, William argues that if the whole\nof past time is infinite then the infinite must have been traversed to\narrive at the present; but since it is impossible to traverse the\ninfinite (OO I, 697b; Teske 1998a, 136), the past must be finite. This\nline of argument is frequently found in later thinkers.\n\nWilliam also presents arguments that the view that a continuum, such\nas time, is infinite results in paradoxes (OO I, 698a\u2013700b).\nThese arguments, which William develops at some length, constitute an\nimportant early medieval engagement with puzzles relating to\ninfinity.\n6.6 Providence\n\nPart IIIa-Iae of On the Universe is a lengthy treatise on\nGod\u2019s providence (providentia). William believes the\ndenial of God\u2019s providence, and in particular the denial that\nthe good will be rewarded and the evil punished, is an error \u201cso\nharmful and so pernicious for human beings that it eliminates from\nhuman beings by their roots all concern for moral goodness, all the\nhonor of the virtues, and all hope of future happiness\u201d (OO I,\n776a; Teske 2007, 92).\n\nAccording to William, God\u2019s providence (providentia) or\nproviding for the universe differs from foreknowledge\n(praescientia) in that, unlike foreknowledge, it embraces\nonly goods and not also evils (see OO I, 754b; Teske 2007, 30).\nWilliam is especially concerned to argue that God\u2019s providence\nis not just general in nature, but extends to all individual\ncreatures. God\u2019s care for the universe and its constituents is a\nmatter of God\u2019s knowing and paying attention to all things. From\nGod\u2019s point of view, nothing happens by chance. William\nintroduces final causality into his explanation by describing the\nuniverse as a teleological or goal-directed order, in which each thing\nhas a function or purpose established by God. God\u2019s care is his\nconcern that each thing fulfills its appointed function. Thus, God is\nnot necessarily concerned with what we might think is best for\nindividual things: flies get eaten by spiders, but this in fact is an\nend for which they were created. And ultimately animals were created\nfor the sake of humans, as William points out (for details on animals\nand providence, see Wei 2020, 49\u201374). In the case of humans,\nhowever, who are the apex of creation, their end is to experience\nhappiness in union with God, and God\u2019s providential care of\nhuman beings is aimed at this.\n\nBut if this is so, why do the evil prosper and the good suffer? What\nare we to make of natural disasters, of pain, suffering, death, and\nthe like? What, in short, are we to make of evil in the world?\nAlthough William does not take up the logical compatibility of evil\nwith an all-good, knowing and powerful god, he does attempt to explain\nat length how a range of particular kinds of evil are compatible with\nGod\u2019s providence and care for human beings. His explanation, in\ngeneral, is not novel and has roots in Augustine. He distinguishes the\nevils perpetrated by free agents and for which they are therefore to\nblame from other forms of evil, and argues that these other evils are\nin fact not really evil but good. Pain, for example, provides many\nbenefits, among which is that it mortifies and extinguishes \u201cthe\nlusts for pleasures and carnal and worldly desires\u201d (OO I, 764a;\nTeske 2007, 58). In many cases, what we call evil is in fact\nGod\u2019s just punishment, which William implies always has\nbeneficial effects. As for the blameworthy evils done by free agents,\nWilliam thinks that God permits these, but that it is incorrect to say\nthey come from God or are intended by him. They are rather the\nconsequence of rational creatures\u2019 misuse of the free will with\nwhich they were created, and the moral balance will be set right in\nthe future life, if not this one.\n\nIf the evils of this life appear to conflict with God\u2019s\nprovidence, God\u2019s providence and foreknowledge themselves seem\nto entail that everything occurs of necessity and hence that there is\nno free will. This concern leads William to consider a number of\ndoctrines that aim to show that all events happen of necessity. In\naddition to foreknowledge or providence, he considers the views that\nall events are the necessary causal outcomes of the motion and\nconfiguration of the heavenly bodies, or that all events result from\nthe heimarmene, i.e. the \u201cinterconnected and\nincessantly running series of causes and the necessary dependence of\none upon another\u201d (OO I, 785a; Teske 2007, 120); or finally,\nthat all things happen through fate (fatum sive fatatio).\nWilliam rejects all these grounds for the necessity of events (esp. on\nfate, see Sannino 2016).\n\nIn an interesting discussion of foreknowledge in part IIIa-Iae,\nchapter 15, he considers the argument that since it is necessary that\nwhatever God foresees will come about will come about, because\notherwise God could be deceived or mistaken, then since God foresees\neach thing that will come about, it is necessary that it will come\nabout. William replies that the proposition \u201cIt is necessary\nthat whatever God foresees (providit) will come about will\ncome about\u201d has two interpretations, \u201cbecause the\nnecessity can refer to individuals or to the whole\u201d (OO I, 778b;\nTeske 2007, 99). The argument for the necessity of all events\nequivocates between these two readings and is therefore invalid.\nWilliam notes that the distinction he makes is close to the\ndistinction between a divided and composite sense, but he is critical\nof those who instead distinguish an ambiguity between a de re\n(about the thing) and de dicto (about what is said)\nreading.\n7. The Soul\n\nWilliam\u2019s treatise On the Soul is one of the most\nsubstantial Latin works on the topic from before the middle of the\nthirteenth century. Although William begins this treatise with\nAristotle\u2019s definition of the soul as the perfection of an\norganic body potentially having life, his conception of the soul is\nheavily influenced by Avicenna and decidedly Platonic in character. He\ninterprets Aristotle\u2019s definition to mean that the body is an\ninstrument of the soul (as he thinks the term \u201corganic\u201d\nindicates) and that \u201ca body potentially having life\u201d must\nrefer to a corpse, since a body prior to death actually has life. And\nalthough he calls a soul, with Aristotle, a form, unlike Aristotle he\nholds that a soul is in fact a substance, something individual,\nsingular and a \u201cthis something\u201d (hoc aliquid),\nnot at all dependent on the body for its existence.\n\nWilliam adopts the standard view that souls serve to vivify or give\nlife to bodies, and thus he posits not just souls of human beings\n(i.e., rational souls), but also those of plants and animals\n(vegetative and sensitive souls respectively), as they all have living\nbodies. But in the case of the human soul, William also identifies the\nsoul with the human being, the referent of the pronoun\n\u201cI.\u201d\n7.1 The Existence and Substantiality of Souls\n\nAmong William\u2019s many arguments for the existence of souls is the\nargument that bodies are instruments of souls and the power to carry\nout operations through an instrument cannot belong to the instrument\nitself. Thus, there must be something other than the bodies of living\nthings that operates by means of bodies, and this is their soul. In\nthe case of the human or rational soul, he argues that its existence\nfollows in particular from the fact that understanding and knowledge\nare found in a human being but not in the whole body or any part of\nit. Since these are operations of a living substance, there must be a\nliving incorporeal substance in which they are, and this is what\npeople mean when they speak of their soul.\n\nThese arguments serve not only to show the existence of souls, but\nalso that they are substances. In the case of the human soul, William\nargues, the operations of understanding and knowing must be treated as\nproper operations of the soul, and this requires that the soul itself\nbe a substance. To the objection that the soul itself does not\nliterally understand or know but is instead that thanks to which a\nhuman being can understand and know, William will argue that the soul\nand human being, which he equates with the referent of the pronoun\n\u201cI,\u201d are one and the same thing. More generally, the\nsubstantiality of souls\u2014and not just of human souls\u2014is\nindicated by the fact that bodies are their instruments.\n7.2 The Incorporeality of Souls\n\nWilliam argues at length that a soul cannot be a body, a conclusion he\napplies not just to human or rational souls, but also to those of\nplants and animals. In the case of human souls, he uses, among others,\nAvicenna\u2019s \u201cflying-man\u201d argument to establish this\npoint, arguing that a human being flying in the air who lacks and\nnever had the use of his senses would know that he exists but deny\nthat he has a body. Therefore \u201cit is necessary that he have\nbeing that does not belong to the body and, for this reason, it is\nnecessary that the soul not be a body\u201d (OO II suppl., 83a; Teske\n2000, 91) (For details, see Hasse 2000).\n\nMore generally, William argues that no body could perform the\nsoul\u2019s function of giving life to the body. For example, if a\nbody were to give life, it would itself have to be a living body, and\nthus it would itself have to have a soul that rendered it alive. This\nsoul, in turn, would have to be a living body and thus have its own\nsoul, and so on ad infinitum. Thus, the doctrine that souls\nare bodies leads to an infinite regress.\n7.3 The Human Soul and the Human Being\n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of William\u2019s teaching about the\nsoul is his identification of the human soul with the human being and\nhis denial that the human body constitutes in whole or part the human\nbeing. Instead, William describes the body variously as a house, the\nsoul its inhabitant; as a prison, the soul its captive; as a cloak,\nthe soul its wearer, and so on. Nevertheless, the definition of a\nhuman being\u2014he perhaps has in mind the Platonic conception of\nthe human being as \u201ca soul using a body\u201d\u2014involves a\nreference to the body, and it this, William thinks, that has led\npeople to believe that the body is a part of a human being. But this\nis an error akin to thinking that because a horseman is defined by\nreference to a horse, the horse must therefore be a part of the\nhorseman. William is aware, of course, that at times we do seem to\nascribe to ourselves, and thus to the human being, the acts of the\nbody or things that happen to the body, but he holds that these are\nnon-literal modes of speaking, akin to a rich man\u2019s complaint\nthat he has been struck by hail, when in fact it was his vineyard that\nwas struck.\n\nWilliam, as usual, offers numerous arguments for the identification of\nthe soul and human being. He argues that the body cannot be a part of\na human being, since the soul and body no more produce a true unity\nthan, for example, a carpenter and his ax, and a human being is a true\nunity. And he notes that since the soul is subject to reward and\npunishment in the afterlife for actions we correctly attribute to the\nhuman being or ourselves, it must be identified with the human being.\nHe also points to cases where our use of names or demonstratives\nreferring to human beings must be understood as referring to their\nsouls, and concludes that this shows that human beings are their\nsouls.\n7.4 The Simplicity of the Soul\n\nAccording to William, souls are among the simplest of created\nsubstances. Nevertheless, like all created substances, they must\ninvolve some kind of composition. This composition cannot be a bodily\ncomposition, of course, since they are not bodies and thus cannot be\ndivided into bodily parts. According to Avicebron, as well as some of\nWilliam\u2019s contemporaries, souls are composite in the sense that\nthey are composites of form and matter, though not a matter that\ninvolves physical dimensions, but rather what some called\n\u201cspiritual matter.\u201d This view is part of the doctrine now\ntermed \u201cuniversal hylomorphism,\u201d according to which every\ncreated substance is a composite of form and matter (see Weisheipl\n1979). William is one of the first to reject this doctrine; he is\nlater followed by Aquinas. In support of his rejection, in On the\nUniverse he makes one of his rare references to Averroes, citing\nwith approval his claim that prime matter is a potentiality only of\nperceptible substances and hence is not found in spiritual substances.\nHe also argues that there is no need to posit matter in angels or\nsouls in order to explain their receptivity in cognition, as some had\nthought necessary (OO I, 851b-852b). Rather, souls and other spiritual\nsubstances are \u201cpure immaterial forms\u201d without matter.\n\nWilliam also denies a real plurality of powers in the soul. He holds\ninstead that each power of the soul is identical with the soul and not\na part of it. When we speak of a power of the soul, we are really\nspeaking of the soul considered as the source or cause of a certain\nkind of operation. Thus, the power to understand characteristic of a\nhuman or rational soul is the soul considered as a source or cause of\nthe operation of understanding.\n\nWhat sort of composition, then, is to be found in souls and other\nspiritual beings? William holds that every being other than God\n\nis in a certain sense composed of that which is (quod est)\nand of that by which it is (quo est) or its being or entity\n\u2026 since being or entity accrues and comes to each thing apart\nfrom its completed substance and account. The exception is the first\nprinciple, to which alone [being] is essential and one with it in the\nultimate degree of unity. (OO I, 852a)\n\n\nHere William uses Boethius\u2019s language of quod est and\nquo est to make the point that in souls, as in all created\nsubstances, there is, to use Avicennian terms, a composition of being\nand essence, a doctrine to be developed by Aquinas.\n7.5 Denial of a Plurality of Souls in the Human Body\n\nBesides rejecting universal hylomorphism, William also rejects the\ndoctrine of a plurality of souls in a human being. This doctrine,\nwhich was popular among Franciscan thinkers, holds that the body of a\nhuman being is informed not just by a single soul, the rational soul,\nbut also by a vegetative and a sensitive soul. This multiplicity of\nsouls, it is held, serves to explain how human beings have the vital\noperations characteristic of plants and animals in addition to\npeculiarly human ones, and also explains the development of the\nfetus\u2019s vital functions. Against this doctrine, William claims\nto have shown earlier in On the Soul that not only the\noperation of understanding, but also the sensitive operations of\nseeing and hearing \u201care essential and proper to the soul\nitself\u201d (OO II suppl., 108b; Teske 2000, 164) and \u201chence,\nit cannot be denied except through insanity that one and the same soul\ncarries out such operations.\u201d Rather than posit a multiplicity\nof souls, William holds that higher souls incorporate the kinds of\noperations attributed to lower ones. The rational soul is infused into\nthe body directly by God when the fetus reaches a suitable stage of\norganization, and the prior animal or sensitive soul in the fetus\nceases to be. In this case too a view along similar lines was to be\ndeveloped by Aquinas.\n\nScholars have noted, however, that while William rejects a plurality\nof souls in the human body, he does subscribe to a version of the\ndoctrine of a plurality of substantial forms in the sense that he\ntreats the human body as itself a substance independent of its\nassociation with the soul, and hence having its own corporeal form,\nwhile also being informed by the human or rational soul, which renders\nit a living thing. (For details see Baz\u00e1n 1969.)\n7.6 The Immortality of the Soul\n\nAccording to William, the immortality of the human soul would be\nevident if not for the fact that the soul has, as it were, been put to\nsleep by the corruption of the body stemming from the punishment for\nsin. In our current state, however, William thinks the human\nsoul\u2019s immortality can be shown by means of philosophical\narguments, to which he devotes considerable attention, both in On\nthe Soul and in a shorter work, On the Immortality of the\nSoul.\n\nHe believes the error that the soul is naturally mortal\n\u201cdestroys the foundation of morality and of all religion\u201d\n(B\u00fclow 1897, 1; Teske 1991, 23), since those who believe in the\nmortality of the soul will have no motive for acting morally and\nhonoring God. Thus, he notes that if the soul is not immortal, the\nhonor of God is pointless in this life, since in the present life it\n\u201cinvolves much torment and affliction for the soul\u201d\n(B\u00fclow 1897, 3; Teske 1991, 25) and receives no reward.\n\nFrom a metaphysical point of view, William argues that the soul does\nnot depend on the body for its being, and therefore the destruction of\nthe body does not entail the non-existence of the soul. The rational\nsoul\u2019s independence from the body is due to the fact it is a\nself-subsistent substance whose proper operations do not involve or\nrequire a human body.\n\nSince William takes the souls of plants and animals to be incorporeal\nsubstances, it might be thought that he would treat them as immortal\ntoo. But William holds that these souls cease to exist upon the death\nof the plant or animal. This is because all their proper operations,\nunlike those of the rational soul, depend on the body, and thus there\nwould be no point for their continued existence after the destruction\nof the body.\n7.7 The Powers Characteristic of the Human Soul\n\nCharacteristic of human souls, or human beings, are the intellective\nand motive powers, that is to say, the intellect and will. William\nthinks that of these, the will is by far the more noble power, and he\nis accordingly puzzled by the fact that neither Aristotle nor Avicenna\nhave much to say about it. These authors do, however, discuss the\nintellective power at great length, and William accordingly devotes\nconsiderable attention to combating errors he sees in their teachings\non the intellect.\n7.7.1 The Motive Power: the Will\n\nWilliam develops his account of the will using the metaphor of a king\nin his kingdom. The will \u201cholds the position in the whole human\nbeing and in the human soul of an emperor and king,\u201d while\n\u201cthe intellective or rational power holds the place and function\nof counselor in the kingdom of the human soul\u201d (OO II suppl.\n95a; Teske 2000, 126, 129). William treats acts of\nwill\u2014expressed in the indicative mood by \u201cI will\u201d\n(volo) or \u201cI refuse\u201d (nolo)\u2014as a\nkind of command that cannot be disobeyed, as distinguished from mere\nlikings expressed in the form \u201cI would like\u201d\n(vellem) or \u201cI would rather not\u2019\n(nollem). He holds that as a king must understand in order to\nmake use of his counselors\u2019 advice, so the will must not simply\nbe an appetitive power but must also have its own capacity to\napprehend. Likewise, the intellect must have its own desires. But he\nnotes in On Virtues, that like a king the will need not heed\nthe advice of its counselor; it may instead \u201cgive itself over to\nthe advice of its slaves, that is, the inner powers and the\nsenses\u201d; in so doing it \u201cgives itself over into becoming a\nslave of its slaves and is like a king \u2026 who follows the will\nand advice of senseless children\u201d (OO I, 122a).\n\nWilliam frequently emphasizes the difference between voluntary action\nand the actions of brute animals. Animals operate in a\n\u201cservile\u201d manner, in the sense that they respond to their\npassions without having control over these responses. A human being,\nin contrast, has power over the suggestion of its desires; its will is\n\u201cmost free and is in every way in its own power and\ndominion\u201d (OO II suppl., 94a; Teske 2000, 123). This is why\nhuman beings, unlike animals, can be imputed with blame or merit for\ntheir deeds.\n\nAccording to William, the freedom of the will consists in the fact\nthat the will \u201ccan neither be forced in any way to its proper\nand first operation, which is to will or refuse, nor prevented from\nthe same; and I mean that it is not possible for someone to will\nsomething and entirely refuse that he will it or to refuse to will\nsomething, entirely willing that he will it\u201d (OO I, 957aA). In\nother words, William defines force and prevention of the will in terms\nof higher-order volitions and refusals: for the will to be forced is\nfor it to refuse to will X and nonetheless be made to will\nX, and for it to be prevented is for it to will to will\nX and be made to refuse X. In a number of works,\nWilliam argues that neither force nor prevention of the will is\npossible: if someone refuses to will X, this must be because\nhe takes X to be bad and thus he must refuse X\nrather than will it; and if someone wills to will X, this\nmust be because he takes X to be good, and thus he must will\nX rather than refuse it.\n7.7.2 The Intellective Power\n\nWilliam\u2019s discussions of the intellective power are driven by a\nconcern to attack errors he sees in his contemporaries and Greek and\nIslamic thinkers. While his reasons for rejecting these errors are\nclear enough, if at times based on a confused understanding of his\nsources, his own views on the nature of cognition are less well\ndeveloped. Yet it is clear that, with the exception of our knowledge\nof first principles and the concepts they involve and certain cases of\nsupernaturally revealed knowledge, William wishes to present a\nnaturalistic account of cognition in this life in which God plays no\nspecial role.\n\nIn both On the Soul and On the Universe William\nattacks at length theories of cognition that posit an agent intellect\n(intellectus agens) or agent intelligence (intelligentia\nagens). He incorrectly ascribes the latter theory to Aristotle,\nalthough in fact it is Avicenna\u2019s teaching; he ascribes the\nformer theory to certain unnamed contemporaries. These theories view\ncognition as involving the active impression of intelligible signs or\nforms\u2014what we might call concepts\u2014on a receptive or\npassive recipient. The agent intellect or agent intelligence is taken\nto perform this function of impressing intelligible forms on our\nmaterial intellect, which is so-called because like matter it is\nreceptive of forms, albeit intelligible forms. The chief difference\nbetween the agent intellect and agent intelligence, as far as the\ntheory of cognition is concerned, is that the former is treated as a\npart of the human soul, while the latter is taken to be a spiritual\nsubstance apart from the human soul, identified with Avicenna\u2019s\ntenth intelligence. William notes how the agent intellect or agent\nintelligence is viewed by analogy with light or the sun; as light or\nthe sun through its light serves to render actual merely potentially\nexisting colors, so the agent intellect or intelligence serves to\nrender actual intelligible forms existing potentially in the material\nintellect.\n\nWilliam as usual offers a large number of objections to these\ntheories. He attacks as inappropriate the analogies with light or the\nsun, and argues that the theory of the agent and material intellects\nis incompatible with the simplicity of the soul, as it posits these\nintellects as two distinct parts of the soul, one active and one\nreceptive. In the case of both the agent intellect and the agent\nintelligence, he argues that their proponents will be forced to hold\nthe absurd result that human beings know everything that is naturally\nknowable, whereas in fact we must study and learn and observe in order\nto acquire much of our knowledge.\n\nAs for his own views on the intellective power, William holds that,\nlike all the powers of the soul, the intellective power in the present\nlife of misery has been corrupted. Therefore an account of it must\ndistinguish its operation in its pure, uncorrupted state from its\noperation in the present life. In its pure state it is capable of\nknowing, without reliance on the senses, everything naturally\nknowable, even sensible things, and thus presumably also is capable of\npossessing the concepts in terms of which such knowledge is\nformulated. In its present state, however, most of its knowledge and\nrepertoire of concepts stems in some manner from sense experience.\n\nThe knowledge of which the intellective power is naturally capable\nextends not just to universals, but also to singulars. For the\nintellect is naturally directed at the true as the will is at the\ngood, and has as its end knowledge of the first truth, the creator,\nwho is singular. William also notes our knowledge of ourselves and the\nimportance of singular knowledge for our dealings with the world.\nUnfortunately, he provides no theory of the nature of singular\ncognition, and this issue must be left on the agenda until taken up by\nthinkers such as Scotus and Ockham in the late thirteenth and early\nfourteenth centuries.\n\nWilliam proposes a representationalist theory of cognition. He holds\nthat it is not things or states of affairs themselves that are in the\nintellective power but rather signs or intelligible forms that serve\nto represent them. He takes these signs to be mental habits, that is\nto say, not bare potentialities but potentialities most ready to be\nactualized. Propositions are those complexes formed from signs through\nwhich states of affairs are represented to the mind. Although William\nspeaks of these signs as likenesses, he is well aware of the\ndifficulty in thinking of concepts as such, and he concludes that in\nfact there need not be a likeness between a sign and that of which it\nis a sign (OO II suppl. 214b; Teske 2000, 454).\n\nA key question William confronts is how we acquire concepts and\nknowledge in the present life. In On the Soul he draws an\nimportant distinction. In the case of the first rules of truth and\nmorality, he speaks of God as a mirror or book of all truths in which\nhuman beings naturally and without an intermediary, and thus without\nreliance on sense experience, read these rules. Likewise, God\nimpresses or inscribes on our intellective power the intelligible\nsigns in terms of which these first rules or principles are\nformulated. Thus, William posits at least some innate concepts; he\nnotes, for example, in On Virtues and Morals  that the\nconcept of the true (veri) is innate (OO I, 124a). God also\nreveals to some prophets in this life \u201chidden objects of\nknowledge to which the created intellect cannot attain except by the\ngift and grace of divine revelation\u201d (OO II suppl., 211b; Teske\n2000, 445).\n\nDoes William therefore hold, as some have held (Gilson 1926), that at\nleast in the case of these rules God in some special manner\nilluminates the human intellect? This might be suggested by his\nreferences to the intellective power as spiritual vision and his\nfrequent use of the language of vision and illumination in his\naccounts of cognition. And yet, according to William, the first rules\nof truth and morality are \u201cknown through themselves\u201d or\nself-evident. They are \u201clights in themselves \u2026 visible\nthrough themselves without the help of something else\u201d (OO II\nsuppl., 210b; Teske 2000, 443), and they serve to illuminate to the\nintellect the conclusions drawn from them. God\u2019s role, it would\nseem, is to impress upon or supply to our intellect, in some way,\nthese principles, but William gives no indication that he takes God to\nshed a special light on these principles in order that they may be\nknown: once possessed they are, as it were, self illuminating.\n\nThe first rules of truth and morality and the concepts in terms of\nwhich they are formulated form only a small subset, however, of our\ncognitive repertoire. The remainder of our concepts and knowledge,\nleaving to one side the special divine revelation made to prophets,\nstems in some way from our dealings with the sensible world. But the\nproblem William faces is to explain how this is so. The problem, he\nsays, is that \u201csensation \u2026 brings to the intellect\nsensible substances and intellectual ones united to bodies [i.e.,\nsouls]. But it does not imprint [pingit] upon it their\nintelligible forms, because it does not receive such forms of\nthem\u201d (OO II suppl., 213a; Teske 2000, 449).\n\nWilliam\u2019s response to this problem is to hold that the senses\nhave the role simply of stimulating the intellective power in such a\nway that it \u201cforms on its own and in itself intelligible forms\nfor itself\u201d (OO I, 914b), a doctrine he draws from Augustine.\nAccording to this account, the intellect is fundamentally active in\nthe acquisition of intelligible forms. William speaks of the intellect\nas able, under the prompting of the senses, to consider the substances\nthat underlie sensible accidents, and speaks of the intellect as\n\u201cabstracting\u201d from sense experience in the sense that it\nforms concepts of so-called \u201cvague individuals\u201d by\nstripping away perceptible features that serve to distinguish one\nindividual from another. In these cases, William says, \u201cthe\nintellect is occasionally inscribed by these forms that are more\nseparate and more appropriate to its nature\u201d (OO II suppl.,\n213b; Teske 2000, 450).\n\nA third cognitive process William mentions, conjunction or connection,\nis concerned not with the acquisition of intelligible forms, but\nrather with how knowledge of one thing brings with it knowledge of\nanother. In particular, William argues that knowledge of a cause\nbrings with it knowledge of the effect.\n\nWilliam is particularly concerned, however, that his account of the\nintellect\u2019s generation of intelligible forms will require a\ndivision of the intellect into active and passive parts\u2014the very\ndistinction between an agent and material or receptive intellect he\nhas devoted so much energy to attacking. The need to make this\ndivision of the intellect into two part is because it is impossible\nfor the same thing to be both active and passive in the same respect,\nand yet in treating the intellect as indivisible it looks as though\nWilliam is in fact committed to its being both active and passive in\nthe same respect in the formation and reception of intelligible\nforms.\n\nWilliam\u2019s attempts to resolve this problem are repeated in a\nnumber of works and couched in highly metaphorical language that poses\nsevere problems of interpretation. The intellective power is both\n\u201ca riverbed and fountain of the scientific and sapiential waters\n\u2026 Hence, in one respect it overflows and shines forth on\nitself, and in another respect it receives such outpouring or\nradiance\u201d (OO II, suppl. 216b; Teske 2000, 457). William holds\nthat because on this account the intellective power is not active and\npassive in the same respect, he is not forced to divide the\nintellect into two distinct parts, one active and one passive.\n8. William\u2019s Influence\n\nScholars have devoted little attention to William\u2019s influence on\nlater writers. Nevertheless, it is clear that he gave rise to no\nschool of thought, and subsequent thinkers seem to have picked and\nchosen from his works the parts they would accept and the parts they\nwould reject. Thus, William\u2019s arguments that the world must have\na beginning probably influenced thinkers such as Bonaventure and Henry\nof Ghent, while his rejection of universal hylomorphism and his\nmetaphysics of being and essence may have influenced Aquinas, who\npresents similar views. There is also little doubt that some of\nWilliam\u2019s views were the subject of criticism, as for example\nhis apparent denial of genuine secondary causation (see Reilly 1953).\nThe large body of manuscripts in which William\u2019s works survive\nsuggests he was being read throughout the middle ages; Ottman 2005,\nfor example, lists 44 manuscripts known to contain On the\nUniverse. William\u2019s works were also published in a number\nof printed editions in the 16th and 17th\ncenturies.\n",
