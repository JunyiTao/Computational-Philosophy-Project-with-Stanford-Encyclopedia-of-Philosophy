    "main_text": "Explanation: From Formal Analyses to Material Structures || Mechanisms and Models\n3.3 Mechanisms and Models\nThe philosophical literature on mechanisms also overlaps with the\nphilosophical literature on scientific models (see\nthe entry on models in science). Here\nwe distinguish mechanical models from models of mechanisms and we\ndiscuss varieties of non-mechanical models.\n3.3.1 Characterizing Completeness\nGlennan (2005) proposed a definition of a mechanical model\nas follows:\n  (MM) A mechanical model consists of (i) a description\nof the mechanism\u2019s behavior (the behavioral description); and (ii) a\ndescription of the mechanism that accounts for that behavior (the\nmechanical description). (446)\nSuch models can be represented in many different ways (see also\nGiere 2004). They are evaluated in terms of their ability to predict\nthe features of the phenomenon and in terms of the mapping between\nitems in the model and the entities, activities, and organizational\nfeatures in the mechanism (Glennan 2005: 17; Kaplan and Craver 2011).\nGlennan emphasizes that there is no hard line between complete and\nincomplete models; rather models are continually in the process of\narticulation and refinement. Whether a model is complete enough is\ndetermined by pragmatic considerations.\nThis last point is related to Darden\u2019s distinction\nbetween mechanism schemas and mechanism sketches\n(Darden and Cain 1989; Darden 2002). In discovering a\nmechanism, it is often crucial to identify gaps that have to be filled\nin one\u2019s model. While no model is ever complete in the absolute sense,\nsome models have lacunae that must be filled before the model is\ncomplete enough\nMechanism schemas are abstract descriptions of mechanisms\nthat can be filled in with details to yield a specific type or token\nmechanism. Thus, the schema:\nDNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 Protein\ncan be filled in with a specific sequence of bases in DNA, its\ncomplement in RNA, and a corresponding amino acid sequence in the\nprotein. The arrows can be filled in, showing how transcription and\ntranslation work. A mechanism sketch is an incomplete\nrepresentation of a mechanism that specifies some of the relevant\nentities, activities, and organizational features but leaves gaps that\ncannot yet be filled. Black boxes, question marks, and filler-terms\n(such as \u201cactivate\u201d, \u201ccause\u201d, or\n\u201cinhibitor\u201d) hold the place for some entity, activity or\nprocess yet to be discovered. The distinction between sketches and\nschemas is a matter of completeness: schemas are more complete than\nsketches in the sense that a sketch omits one or more stages of the\nmechanism that have to be understood if one really wants to solve\none\u2019s discovery problem.\nMechanists also emphasize the distinction between\na how-possibly schema and a how-actually-enough\nschema (Craver and Darden 2013). A how-possibly schema describes how\nentities and activities might be organized to produce a\nphenomenon. A how possibly model is n hypothesis about how the\nmechanism works. Such models might be true (enough) or false. A true\n(enough) how-possibly model is (though we may not know it) also a\nhow-actually (enough) model. A how-actually-enough schema describes\nhow entities and activities are in fact organized to produce the\nphenomenon. The term \u201chow-actually-enough\u201d captures the\nidea that the requisite \u201caccuracy\u201d of a mechanistic model\ncan vary considerably from one pragmatic context to another (Weisberg\n2013).A false how possibly model is merely a how possibly model;\njust-so-stories are merely how possibly models (Dray 1957; Brandon\n1985). Used in this way, the term \u201chow possibly model\u201d is\nsimilar to the term \u201chypothesis\u201d: it is entertained as a\npossibility but not necessarily endorsed.\n3.3.2 Abstraction and Idealization\nIn contrast to mechanism schemas and sketches, some models of\nmechanisms work not by describing all of the parts, causal\ninteractions, and organizational features, but rather by abstracting\naway from such potentially obfuscating details (Craver and Darden\n2013; Strevens 2008; Levy and Bechtel 2012). In such cases, idealizing\nassumptions can be introduced to bring the relevant feature of the\nmechanism most clearly into view: infinite populations, frictionless\nplanes, perfect geometrical shapes are presumed in order to strip the\nmodel of detail that does not matter for, or would only obstruct, the\nintended purposes of model.\nCritics of the new mechanical philosophy have pushed on the\nimportance of abstraction in science, drawing attention to the above\ndiscussions of completeness. The goals of completeness and accuracy\nare taken to conflict with the common practice of being satisfied with\nmodels that sacrifice detail and truth for clarity and generality\n(Strevens 2008; Woodward 2014). The normative distinction between a\nschema and a sketch, for example, seems to suggest that science\nprogresses by moving from incomplete to complete models. And the\ndistinction between how-possibly and how-actually-enough likewise\nseems to privilege accuracy over other goals of modeling, which often\nrequire distortion and falsity (see Wimsatt 2007; Weisberg 2007; Levy\nand Bechtel 2012; Batterman and Rice 2014; Chirimuuta 2014; Levy\n2014).\nYet mechanists can surely allow that not all models of mechanisms\nare mechanical models or mechanism schemas. Often other sorts of model\nare useful for isolating central aspects of a mechanism\u2019s\nfunctioning. Dynamical models, for example, can be used to\ncharacterize the temporal dynamics of a mechanism (Bechtel 2013a,b;\nKaplan and Bechtel 2011). Network models can be used to characterize\npatterns of connectivity regardless of what units are connected and\nregardless of what kinds of connections one is particularly interested\nin characterizing (Hunneman 2010). Minimal models can be used to\ncapture something fundamental about the dynamics of a broad class of\nmechanisms that share no entities and activities in common (Batterman\n2002). A model of a mechanism is a model that describes a\nmechanism. It need not be a mechanical model or a mechanism schema, in\nthe above sense, to play that role.\nSome mechanists reserve the term \u201cmechanical models\u201d\nfor models that describe the entities, activities, and organizational\nfeatures of a system. According to Glennan\u2019s (2005) account, a\nmechanical model that leaves out some relevant features is, ipso\nfacto, incomplete and sketchy. One specific instantiation of this\ndebate concerns the explanatory force of functional models in\npsychology. Piccinini and Craver (2011)\nargue that such models should be understood as mechanistic sketches,\nblack-box models to be evaluated and filled in as details about the\nunderlying mechanism are discovered. Black box models are incomplete\nin virtue of leaving out details about underling mechanisms and that\nthose models ultimately depend for their explanatory force on the\npromise that the functional models do, in fact, correspond to how the\nmechanism works. (See Weiskopf 2011 for a criticism of this account\nand Povich forthcoming for a response) \nOne might talk about mechanistic explanation in a way that\nabstracts from the kind of model used to describe the mechanism: the\ncommitment to mechanistic explanation is not a commitment about the\nform of the model but rather a commitment about what such models must\nrepresent: namely, causal and mechanistic structures. Models are\nexplanatory in virtue of the fact that they represent the\ncausal/mechanistic structures that produce, underlie, or maintain the\nphenomenon. They are non-mechanistic if they refer to some non-causal,\nnon-mechanistic kind of relation (Salmon 1984; Craver 2014).\n3.4 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nTo date, much of the work on mechanistic explanation has been\ndriven by the goal of providing a descriptively and normatively\nadequate theory of mechanistic explanation. Some claim there are kinds\nof explanation that rely very little on a precise understanding of the\nmechanistic details of a system (Woodward 2014; Weiskopf 2011) or that\nwork fundamentally by removing all such details from one\u2019s model\n(Batterman and Rice 2014). Resolving such debates will require being\nvery clear about precisely what one expects out of a philosophical\ntheory of scientific explanation and what one takes a scientific\nexplanation to be (Strevens 2008; Craver 2014). Research is required\nto understand the diverse representational forms that scientists use\nto represent mechanisms (Burnston et al. forthcoming), and to\nunderstand the role of idealization in mechanistic explanation (Levy\nand Bechtel 2012; Huneman 2010). Further work is also required to limn\nthe boundaries between mechanistic explanation and other putative\nvarieties of explanation and to say, as perspicuously as Hempel or the\ncausal-mechanical theory, what a model must do to count as explanatory\nand precisely how good explanations are to be distinguished from\nbad.\n4. Metaphysics of Mechanisms\nIn this section, we review some of the ways that the concept of\nmechanism has been used in diverse areas of metaphysics. Of all the\nareas we have discussed, this is likely the most in need of future\ndevelopment. Here we discuss the relationship between mechanisms and\nlaws, emergence, realization, natural kinds, and functions.\n4.1 Token Mechanisms, Type Mechanisms, and Laws\nIn much of the early literature on mechanisms, mechanisms are\ncontrasted explicitly with laws of nature (Bechtel 1988; Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen 2005; MDC 2000). This contrast clearly grew out of an\nemerging consensus in philosophy that there are few, or perhaps no,\nlaws of biology (see Section 3.1 above). The\nempirical generalizations one finds in biology tend to be hedged\nby ceteris paribus clauses; whether they hold or not depends\non background conditions that might not hold and on conditions\ninternal to the mechanism that might fail.  These generalizations, in\nshort, are mechanistically explicable; what necessity they have\nderives from a mechanism (Cummins 2000; Glennan 1996). Mechanisms thus\nseem to play the role of laws in the biological sciences: we seek\nmechanisms to explain, predict, and control phenomena in nature even\nif mechanisms lack many of the characteristics definitive of laws in\nthe logical empiricist framework (such as universality, inviolable\nnecessity, or unrestricted scope).\nOne specific strand of this discussion emerged from consideration\nof Weber\u2019s (2005) argument that biology is heteronymous,\ni.e., that it ultimately borrows its explanatory power from the laws\nof physics and chemistry. Weber uses Hodgkin and Huxley\u2019s model of the\naction potential as an exemplar of the reducing biological phenomena\nto physical laws (such as Ohm\u2019s law and the Nernst equation). Craver\n(2006) responds that the explanatory force of Hodgkin and\nHuxley\u2019s model, in fact, requires a grasp of the distinctly biological\nproperties of ion channels, which properties were black-boxed in\nHodgkin and Huxley\u2019s total current equation (see also Craver 2007;\nBogen 2008b; Weber 2008).\nYet the contrast between laws and mechanisms has not always been\nentirely clear. Some, such as Bogen (2005), Machamer (2004), and\nGlennan (forthcoming) emphasize that causes and mechanisms are, at\nbase, singular, not general or universal. Leuridan (2010), building on\nthe work of Mitchell (2000), objects that mechanisms cannot replace\nlaws of nature in our conceptual understanding of explanation and the\nmetaphysics of science. Scientists rarely investigate token\nmechanisms, one might think, but are much more interested in\ntypes. And once one starts talking about types of mechanisms, one is\nback in the business of formulating general regularities about how\nmechanisms work. So it would appear that the concept of mechanism\ncannot supplant the work that generalization was supposed to do, but\nrequires the idea of regularity, and so something akin to laws, if it\nis to do that explanatory work (see Andersen 2011, 2012, 2014a,b;\nKrickel 2014). For a reply to Leuridan, see Kaiser and Craver (2013).\n \n4.2 Mechanisms, Levels, and Emergence\nWork on mechanisms has also helped to clarify the idea of levels of\norganization and its relation to other forms of organization and\nnon-mechanistic forms of emergence.\nMany mechanists, following Simon (1996 [1962]), emphasize that\nbiological systems are hierarchically organized into near-decomposable\nstructures: mechanisms within mechanisms, within mechanism. Using the\nparable of Tempus and Hora, Simon (1962) argued that a watchmaker who\nbuilds hierarchically decomposable watches (Tempus) will make more\nwatches than one who builds holistic watches (Hora). This parable led\nSimon to the conclusion that evolved structures are more likely to be\nnearly decomposable into hierarchically organized, more or less stable\nstructures and sub-structures. Some have objected that the story is\nmisleading because evolution does not construct organisms from\nscratch, piece by piece (Bechtel 2009b). Steel (2008), building on the\nwork of others (Schlosser and Wagner 2004), therefore attempts to\nreconstruct this argument as a way of showing that evolved systems are\nmore likely to be modular: systems made of independently manipulable\nparts can quarantine the effects of changes to specific parts, giving\nthem added flexibility to make local changes without causing\ncatastrophic side-effects.\nThe near decomposability of mechanisms is directly related to the\nidea that mechanisms span multiple levels of organization. The\nbehavior of the whole is explained in terms of the activities and\ninteractions among the component parts. These activities and\ninteractions are themselves sustained by underlying activities and\ninteractions among component parts, and so on (see Bechtel and\nRichardson 2010 [1993]).  Craver (2007) defines levels of mechanisms\nin terms of a relationship between the behavior (\u03c8) exhibited\nby a system (S) and the activity (\u03c6) of some component\npart (X) of that system. On this\naccount, X\u2019s \u03c6-ing is at a lower level of mechanistic\norganization than S\u2019s \u03c8-ing if and only if (i) X\nis a part of S, and (ii) X\u2019s \u03c6-ing is a component\nin S\u2019s \u03c8-ing. In short, to say that something is at a\nlower mechanistic level than the mechanism as a whole is to say that\nit is a working part of the mechanism. Though the term\n\u201clevel\u201d is used in many legitimate ways,\nlevels of mechanisms seem to play a central role in structuring the\nrelations among many different models in contemporary biology (e.g.,\nbetween Mendelian and molecular genetics (Darden 2006), between\nlearning and memory and channel physiology (Craver 2007), and between\npopulation-level variation and developmental mechanisms (Tabery 2009,\n2014a)).\nOne implication of this view of levels, combined with certain\nfamiliar assumptions about causal relations, is that there can be no\ncausal relationships between items at different levels of mechanisms.\nThere can be causal relationships between things of different sizes,\nand there can be causal relationships between things described in very\ndifferent vocabularies; but (again, conjoined with certain assumptions\nabout the temporal asymmetry of cause and effect and the independence\nof cause and effect) there cannot be causal relationships between the\nbehavior of a mechanism and the activities of the parts that jointly\nconstitute that behavior. Claims about interlevel causation, which are\nubiquitous in the scientific literature, are best understood either as\ntargeting a different sense of levels or, concerning levels of\nmechanisms, as expressing hybrid claims combining constitutive claims\nabout the relationship between the behavior of the mechanism as a\nwhole and the activities of its parts, and causal claims concerning\nrelationships between things not related as part and whole (Craver and\nBechtel 2007). For alternative interpretations of levels, see Fehr\n2004; Leuridan 2011; Thalos 2013; Eronen\n2013; 2015; Baumgartner\nand Gebhardter forthcoming; Romero\nforthcoming. For\nreflections on the metaphysical status of higher-level phenomena and\nhigher-level causes, see Baumgartner 2010; Glennan\n2010 a, b; Hoffman-Kolss 2014, as\nwell as the entries on \n causation and manipulability,\n physicalism, and\n scientific reduction.\nAs noted above, the fact that phenomena at higher levels of\nmechanisms depend upon the organization of component parts entails\nthat the properties/activities of wholes are not simple sums of the\nproperties/activities of the parts. Levels of mechanisms can thus be\ncontrasted with levels of mere aggregation. Because the whole is\ngreater (in this sense) than the sum of the parts, some (such as\nWimsatt) have found it appropriate to describe this as a kind of\nemergence. Mechanistic (or organizational) emergence thus\nunderstood is ubiquitous and banal but extremely important for\nunderstanding how scientists explain things.\nAlso familiar is epistemic emergence, the inability to\npredict the properties or behaviors of wholes from properties and\nbehaviors of the parts. Epistemic emergence can arise as a result of\nignorance, such as failing to recognize a relevant variable, or from\nfailing to know how different variables interact in complex networks.\nIt might also result from limitations on human cognitive abilities or\nin current-generation representational tools (Bedau 1997; Boogerd\n2005; Richardson and Stephan 2007). The practical necessity of\nstudying mechanisms by decomposing them into component parts raises\nthe epistemic challenge of putting the parts back together again in a\nway that actually works (Bechtel 2013a).\nThe mechanists\u2019 emphasis on mechanistic/organizational and\nepistemic emergence contrasts with their desire to distance themselves\nfrom spooky emergence (Richardson and Stephan 2007). Spooky emergence\nwould involve the appearance of new properties with no sufficient\nbasis in mechanisms. It is not clear that emergent properties are\nproperly said to be properties of the necessary mechanisms; and it is\nnot clear in what since the emergent property is\n\u201cemergent\u201d rather than a fundamental feature of the causal\nstructure of the world.\nIn short, such forms of emergence are altogether distinct from, and\nso gain no plausibility from, verbal association with\norganizational/mechanistic and epistemic emergence.\n4.3 Mechanisms and Realization\nBecause the framework concept of a mechanism is so useful for\nthinking about levels and explanation in the sciences, some scholars\nhave sought in the notion of mechanism a way of fleshing out the\nontological relationship of realization.\nAccording to the \u201cflat view\u201d (Gillett 2002) realization\nis a relationship between different properties of one and the same\nthing (Kim 1998; Shapiro 2000; Shoemaker 2003, 2007; Polger 2007). The\nsubset view, which holds that a property P1 (e.g., mean kinetic energy\nof the gas) realizes property P2 (e.g., temperature of the gas) when\nthe causal powers distinctive of P2 (temperature) are a subset of the\ncausal powers distinctive of P2 (mean kinetic energy), is an example\nof the flat view. P1 and P2 are both attributed to the same thing, the\ngas (Gillett 2002, 2003). The dimensioned view describes realization\nas a relationship holding between the properties of wholes and the\nproperties of the parts and their organization. This view of\nrealization comports with the explanatory aims of the special sciences\nand fits nicely with the evidential base on which interlevel claims\nare grounded (see Aizawa and Gillett 2011). Gillett has since expanded\nthis notion to handle the realization of objects, properties, and\nprocesses (Gillett 2013); for criticism and alternatives, see Polger\n2010; Melnyk 2003; Melnyk 2010)\n4.4 Mechanisms and Natural Kinds\nMechanistic theories of natural kinds develop out of\nBoyd\u2019s homeostatic property cluster (HPC) view. The HPC view\nis a theory of natural kinds designed to work in domains with high\nindividual variability. The HPC view is offered as a third way between\nessentialism and nominalism about kinds in the special sciences (Boyd\n1991, 1997, 1999; Kornblith 1993; Wilson 1999, 2005; see also\nthe entry on natural kinds).\nAccording to this view, a natural kind is characterized by i) a\ncluster of properties that regularly co-occur, and ii) a similarity\ngenerating mechanism that explains why the properties in (i) tend to\nco-occur. In short, kinds are property clusters explained by\nmechanisms.\nThis view of natural kinds has been deployed to argue for taxonomic\nrevision in, for example, the biology of human emotion (Griffiths\n1997), the structure of concepts (Machery 2009), and the taxonomy of\npsychiatry (Kendler, Zachar, and Craver\n2010; see Craver 2009): a\nputatively single kind is split into multiple kinds because it is\ndiscovered that distinct properties in a property cluster are\nexplained by distinct mechanisms. This view of kinds can also be used\nto make sense of kinds that are historically transient and, in some\nways, the product of human attitudes and so socially constructed in\nthis straightforward sense; perhaps race is like this (see Kuorikoski\nand P\u00f6yh\u00f6nin 2012; Khalidi 2013).\n4.5 Mechanisms and Functions\nEmphasis on the importance of mechanisms is historically associated\nwith the rejection of teleology and formal causes (e.g., Westfall\n1971). Yet contemporary biology and many other special sciences,\ndespite the widespread acceptance of the mechanism framework concept,\ncontinue to make use of the concept of function, a teleological notion\n(see the entry on \n teleological notions in biology).\n How is the notion of function at play in contemporary\nscience related to the concept of mechanism? Craver (2001a), following\nCummins (1975), argues that functional description is a perspectival\nmeans of situating some part within a higher-level\nmechanism. According to this view, teleology is not a feature of the\nworld so much as it is imposed upon it by an intentional describer\n(see also Machamer 1977). Garson (2011, 2012), following Wimsatt\n(1972b), Wright (1973) and Neander (1991a,b), argues that functions\nare effects of an item that are part of the etiological explanation\n(through selection, learning, or reinforcement) for why the item is\npresent; as such, functions are reduced to causal histories. In a\nthird view, Maley and Piccinini (forthcoming) argue that the\n(teleological) function of an item is its contribution to the goals of\norganisms, which may be objective or subjective goals. Like Garson,\nMaley and Piccinini hold that functions are objective (i.e., not\nobserver relative). Unlike Garson, however, they are not grounded in\nthe etiology of the item but in their current contribution to survival\nor reproduction (the objective goals of organisms) or to what the\norganism itself desires (the subjective goals of organisms).\n4.6 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nWhat must the world be like for this mechanistic perspective to be\naccurate? Clearly, there are many ways of answering this question from\ndifferent metaphysical starting assumptions. And clearly, many\nmetaphysical starting assumptions rule this world picture out as\nillegitimate. The clearest path forward, it would seem, is to work out\nprecisely what one must be committed to in holding that the world is\ncomposed of a hierarchy of mechanisms and precisely what of that can\nbe recovered on the basis of different starting assumptions.\nThat said, not all applications of the mechanism framework require\na fully articulated metaphysics. Work on discovery and explanation\nmight proceed perfectly well without embracing any particular\nmetaphysical world picture. Philosophers with different interests\n(discovery, explanation, testing, reduction, emergence, and so) are\nlikely to elaborate the concept in different ways. There is every\nreason to doubt, that the idea of mechanism can be given a one-size\nfits all metaphysical analysis that will adequately address the\ndiverse philosophical ends to which the concept is being deployed.\n5. Relations between Scientific Disciplines: From Theory Reduction to Mechanism Integration\n5.1 Theory Reduction\nAccording to Nagel (1961), reduction is a species of covering-law\nexplanation: one theory is reduced to another when it is possible to\nidentify the theoretical terms of the first with those of the second\nand to literally derive the first from the second. On the assumption\nthat scientific disciplines and theories correspond to one another,\nreduction serves as a model of interdisciplinary integration as well.\nMechanist\u2019s objections to the covering-law model of constitutive\nexplanation (i.e., micro-reduction) are discussed above\n(see Section 3.1); here the focus is rather\non how distinct disciplines of science are integrated.\nOn the Nagel view, reduction is an interlevel relationship. It is\nalso a relationship between theories. Theories about phenomena at a\nhigher level (e.g., gases, lightning, and life) are reduced to (i.e.,\nderived from) theories about phenomena at lower levels (e.g.,\nmolecules, electrons, and physiological systems). Finally, the\nrelationship is formally specified and has little to do with either\nthe content of the theories or the material structures those theories\ndescribe. From the mechanistic perspective, each of these features of\nthe Nagel model is problematic.\n5.2 Mechanism Integration\nFirst, mechanists criticize the idea that reduction should be\nunderstood primarily as a relationship between theories. In\nintegrating their results, scientists are not simply building theories\nsimpliciter; they are building theories about mechanisms. Mechanisms\ncan perhaps be described using formal accounts of\ntheories\u2014perhaps they can be axiomatized in predicate logic or\nreconstructed as set theoretic predicates. But such formal accounts of\nthe structures of scientific theories gloss over the mechanistic\nstructures crucial for understanding how these theories are\nconstructed and evaluated (Craver 2001b).\nMechanists also challenge the idea that disciplines are related by\nway of the relationship between their theories. Darden and\nMaull (1977) argued that disciplinary fields often integrate their\nfindings through the construction of interfield theories, appealing to\ndiverse material relationships between items in the different\nfields\u2019 domains: relations such as cause and effect, part and\nwhole, or structure and function. Darden and Maull did not offer a\ngeneral account of interfield theories, but Bechtel presciently\nsuggested that such theories often take the form of descriptions of\nmechanisms (Bechtel 1988: 101\u2013102).\nThe mechanistic approach also has been claimed to have many\nadvantages over reduction for thinking about interlevel forms of\ninterdisciplinary integration. First, it provides a straightforward\nway to interpret the talk of levels (see\nSections 2.4.5  and 4.2). Second, it offers\nsignificantly more insight into what interlevel integration is, into\nthe evidential constraints by which interlevel bridges are evaluated,\nand into the forces driving the co-evolution of work at different\nlevels. Constraints on the parts, their causal interactions, and their\nspatial, temporal, and hierarchical organization all help to flesh out\nan interlevel integration. Finally, mechanists repeatedly recognize\nthe need to not only look down to the constitutive mechanisms\nresponsible for a given phenomenon (emphasized by classical reduction\nmodels), but also to look up and around to the context within which\nthe phenomenon is embedded: interlevel integration is an effort to see\nhow phenomena at many different levels are related to one another\n(Bechtel 2009a; Craver 2007).\nMechanists have developed several extended examples of the many\nforms of mechanism integration pursued in mechanistic research\nprograms. Darden (2005), for example, suggests that philosophers in\nthe grip of classical reduction fundamentally misunderstood the\nrelationship between Mendelian and molecular genetics. While\nreductionists see it as an instance of interlevel explanation, she\nargues, it is in fact a case in which different scientists worked on\ndifferent parts of a mechanism that are etiologically (not\nconstitutively) related to one another. Mendelian genetics did not\nreduce to molecular biology; rather, classical geneticists and\nmolecular biologists integrated their work by focusing on different\nworking entities in the sequentially operating chromosomal and\nmolecular hereditary mechanisms. Examples have also been drawn from\nthe discovery of the mechanisms of protein synthesis (Darden 2006) and\ncell biology (Bechtel 2006). Craver (2007) uses examples from\nthe neuroscience of memory to explore how multilevel integration does\nand ought to proceed. In each case, the search for mechanisms serves\nas an abstract scaffold onto and around which the findings of diverse\nscientists converge.\n5.2.1 Integrative Pluralism\nThe mechanistic perspective tends to emphasize integrative\npluralism in scientific research (Mitchell 2003, 2009). The goal is\nnot to explain the less fundamental in terms of the more fundamental\nin a step-wise relating of monolithic theories at one level to\nmonolithic theories at another. Rather, such scientific achievements\nare collaborative and piecemeal, adding incremental constraints to an\nemerging picture of how a mechanism works both at a level and across\nlevels. The many scientific disciplines that investigate a phenomenon\npluralistically co-exist and co-inform one another by integratively\ncontributing to the etiological, constitutive, and contextual\nmechanistic explanations of that phenomenon (Bechtel\n2009a; Tabery 2014a).\n5.3 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nThe Nagel model of theory reduction offers a clear vision of the\n\u201cunity of science\u201d\n(see the entry on unity of science).\nAccording to the model, the unity among scientific disciplines is\nachieved by reducing theories of higher-level disciplines to the\ntheories of lower-level disciplines. Integration, on that vision, is\nunderstood as progress toward a grand, unified body of scientific\nknowledge. For mechanists, in contrast, integration is piecemeal,\nlocal, and pluralistic. What sort of unity could such an\n\u201cintegration\u201d sustain? This question plays out in a\nback-and-forth between Longino and Tabery concerning disciplinary\nrelationships in the behavioral sciences. Tabery argues that\ndisciplines as disparate as neurobiology and quantitative genetics\ncould pluralistically co-exist and co-inform one another\u2019s causal\nexplanations of complex behaviors by way of mechanism integration.\nLongino counters that Tabery\u2019s pluralism is only a\n\u201cmoderate\u201d sort because the push for integration\nultimately is a push for unification (Longino 2013, 2014; Tabery\n2014a,b).  Sullivan (2009) also challenges the push for mechanism\nintegration; she argues that there are significant barriers to the\nkind of integration mechanists envision. Different laboratories use\ndifferent experimental protocols to study what they assume to be the\nsame phenomenon; however, these different protocols often in fact\ntarget different phenomena, so the integration achieved by combining\nresults is only illusory. These discussions are symptomatic of more\ngeneral philosophical questions faced by mechanists: How are mechanism\nintegrations actually achieved (as opposed to just asserted)? And what\nis the relationship between mechanism integration and unification? The\nnew mechanical philosophy stands to benefit from future efforts to\nsituate mechanistic integration into more general philosophical views\nof integration and pluralism.\n6. Discovery: From A-ha Moments to Discovery Strategies\n6.1 Discovery via A-ha Moments\nWhat can philosophers say about scientific discovery? Many logical\nempiricists had a simple answer: Nothing. According to Popper, for\nexample, philosophers can illuminate the epistemology of testing, but\nthey can say nothing of substance about how scientists generate the\nideas to be tested (Popper 1959). Such \u201cA-ha!\u201d moments of\ncreativity are in the province of psychology, not philosophy.\nReichenbach distinguished the context of discovery from the context of\njustification (the \u201ccontext distinction\u201d) (Reichenbach\n1938; but see the entry on \n Hans Reichenbach for an alternate\n interpretation of this\ndistinction). The process of scientific discovery was thus largely off\nlimits to philosophers.\nNot all philosophers of science agreed. Hanson, for example,\narticulated a logic of discovery involving abductive inferences from\nanomalous data to new hypotheses designed to account for them (Hanson\n1958). Others focused on methodologies of discovery that could either\nallow one to rationally reconstruct why something was discoverable at\na given time (Nickels 1985) or to explain why a new hypothesis is\nconsidered promising and worthy of further investigation (Schaffner\n1993). Early contributions to the new mechanical philosophy followed\nthis path and characterized investigative strategies scientists use to\ndiscover mechanisms (see the entry on \n scientific discovery).\n6.2 Discovery via Strategies\nBechtel and Richardson\u2019s Discovering Complexity (2010\n[1993]) is organized around a flowchart representing choice-points in\nthe discovery of a mechanism. The process of searching for mechanisms\nbegins with a provisional characterization of the phenomenon. Then\nfollow strategies of localizing the mechanism within the\nsystem, and decomposing the phenomenon into distinct\nsub-functions. Localization of function involves determining which of\nthese sub-functions of the system is performed by which parts. Bechtel\nand Richardson further characterize the use of excitatory and\ninhibitory experiments to obtain these kinds of information. Bechtel\nand Abrahamsen (2013) add a subsequent stage, in which\nscientists recompose what they have learned about the\nfunctional parts by putting them back together to produce the\nphenomenon in question (perhaps using simulations). \nDarden also emphasized mechanisms as an important framework concept\nin scientific discovery (Darden 1980, 1982, 1986, 1991). In the\ndiscovery of protein synthesis (jointly investigated by molecular\nbiologists and biochemists in the 1950s and 1960s), scientists didn\u2019t\nsimply have an \u201cA-ha\u201d moment. Rather, they deployed\nstrategies for revealing how a mechanism works (Darden 2006; Craver\nand Darden 2013). Darden characterizes the process of mechanism\ndiscovery as an \u201cextended, piecemeal process with hypotheses\nundergoing iterative refinement\u201d; that process occurs via the\nconstruction, evaluation, and revision of mechanism schemas in light\nof observational and experimental constraints (Darden 2006: 272).\nDarden\u2019s construction strategies are strategies for generating new\nhypotheses about a mechanism. In addition to decomposition and\nlocalization, Darden shows that scientists often borrow a schema\ntype from another area of science, as when selection-type\nmechanisms were borrowed to understand how the immune system works, or\nassemble a mechanism from known modules of functional activity\n(modular sub-assembly), as is common in biochemistry and\nmolecular biology. Sometimes, scientists know one part of the\nmechanism and attempt to work forward or backward through to the other\nparts and activities. In the discovery of the mechanism of protein\nsynthesis, for example, molecular biologists worked forward from the\nstructure of DNA to figure out what molecules could interact with it\n(forward chaining), and biochemists worked backward from\nproteins to figure out what chemical reactions would be necessary to\ncreate them (backward chaining). They met in the middle at\nRNA. Protein synthesis is now understood to involve transcribing DNA\ninto RNA and then translating RNA into proteins. Far from being\nphilosophically inscrutable, Darden points out that scientists used\nwhat they knew about the working entities and activities in the\nmechanism to infer what could come next or before in the mechanism of\nprotein synthesis (Darden 2006; see\nalso the entry on \nmolecular biology).\nEvaluation strategies, for Darden, involve constraint-based\nreasoning to limn the contours of the space of possible\nmechanisms for a given phenomenon. Often scientists reason about how a\nmechanism works by building off basic findings concerning the spatial\nand temporal organization of its parts. Harvey, for example, reasoned\nhis way to the circulation of the blood by considering the locations\nof the valves of the veins and their orientation with respect to the\nheart. These organizational constraints, and many others, combined to\nnarrow the space of possible mechanisms to a small region containing a\nmodel in which the blood completes a circuit of the body (Craver and\nDarden 2013).\nDarden and Craver also discuss experimental strategies for learning\nhow a mechanism works. These strategies reveal how different entities\nand activities in a mechanism act, interact, and are organized\ntogether. For example, one might intervene to remove a putative\ncomponent to see if and how the mechanism functions in its absence\n(inhibitory experiments). Or one might stimulate\nthat component to see if it can drive the mechanism or modulate its\nbehavior. Or one might activate a mechanism by placing it in\nthe precipitating conditions for the phenomenon and observe how the\nentity or activity changes as the mechanism works. Craver (2002)\ndiscusses these under the heading of \u201cinterlevel\nexperiments\u201d (see also Harinen forthcoming). \nCraver and Darden (2013) also discuss more complex\nkinds of experiments for learning what sort of entity or activity\ncontributes to a process and for learning more complex features of a\nmechanism\u2019s organization.\nDatteri (2009; Datteri and Tamburrini 2007), explores the use of\nrobotic simulations for the purposes of testing mechanisms. They\ndiscuss both how assumptions are built into robotic models and how\nexperiments can be designed to reveal how mechanisms work. This work\nextends the mechanistic framework into the area of bio-robotics and\nreveals a set of strategies distinct from those explored in Darden\u2019s\nwork.\nRather than focusing on the process by which mechanism schemas are\nconstructed, evaluated, and revised, Steele focuses on the question of\nhow one extrapolates from a sample population or a model organism to\nthe structure of a mechanism in the target. Will a treatment proven to\nsuppress tumors in mice (a model organism) also suppress tumors in\nhumans (the target population)? After developing a probabilistic\naccount of mechanisms, Steele considers how researchers get around\nwhat he calls the extrapolator\u2019s circle: determining\n\nhow we could know that the model and the target are\nsimilar in causally relevant respects without already knowing the\ncausal relationship in the target. (Steel 2008: 78)\n\n Steel breaks the extrapolator\u2019s circle by\ndeveloping a mechanisms-based extrapolation strategy\u2014the\nstrategy of comparative process tracing. Once a mechanism for\nsome phenomenon has been elucidated in a model (such as a particular\nprocess of carcinogenesis in rats), scientists (toxicologists in this\ncase) then compare key stages (particularly downstream stages) of the\nmodel with the stages in the target, paying particular attention to\npoints in the process where differences are most likely to arise. The\ngreater the similarities of the entities, activities, and organization\nof the mechanisms in both populations, the stronger is the basis for\nextrapolation; the greater the differences, the weaker the basis (but\nsee Howick et al. 2013; see also the sections on extrapolation in the\nentries on\n molecular biology\nand\n experiment in biology).\n6.3 Mechanistic Evidence in Medical Discoveries\nDiscovery in medicine is another domain where the mechanical\nphilosophy has been applied. Thagard draws on the case of H.\npylori as a cause of ulcers to provide an account of how\ninvestigating mechanisms contributes to scientific discovery.\nThagard draws attention to both statistical evidence that suggests\nulcers are somehow associated with H. pylori, as well as\nmechanistic evidence that can explain how the agent of infection could\npersist in a hostile environment long enough to cause an ulcer. More\nrecently, philosophers interested in evidence-based medicine have\nprobed the relationship between these two types of evidence in the\nhealth sciences. Russo and Williamson argue that both types of\nevidence are necessary to justify causal inference; the correlational\nevidence establishes that there is a difference-making relation\nbetween some cause and some effect, while the mechanistic evidence\nestablishes how exactly the cause produces its effect\u2014the\n\u201cRusso-Williamson Thesis\u201d (Russo and Williamson\n2007). Philosophers have since refined the Russo-Williamson Thesis,\npointing out, for instance, that \u201ctype of evidence\u201d could\nrefer to different methodologies for gathering evidence or to\ndifferent objects of evidence.  Difference-making methodologies\ninclude observational studies and randomized controlled trials, while\nmechanistic methodologies include interventionist experiments such as\nthose described above; likewise, the object of evidence could be the\nevidence of an associated difference or it could be the evidence\nconcerning the mechanism linking the cause and effect (Illari 2011;\nsee also Campaner 2011).  Evidence-based medicine hierarchies, which\nrank different kinds of evidence in terms of its epistemic strength,\ntend to prioritize evidence from difference-making methodologies (such\nas randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses) over mechanistic\nevidence; in reply, these philosophers argue that the different types\nof evidence are on a par (each with its own strengths and weaknesses)\nand advocate for integrating difference-making and mechanistic\nevidence, a sentiment which aligns with the emphasis on mechanism\nintegration discussed in Section 5.2 above\n(Clarke et al. 2013, 2014). \n6.4 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nMany mechanists have explored the strategies that scientists use in\ndiscovery. Bechtel and Richardson attended to decomposition and\nlocalization; Darden and Craver highlighted forward and backward\nchaining; Russo and Williamson emphasized drawing on both\ndifference-making and mechanistic evidence. These strategies were\nfound in specific, experimental sciences, such as neuroscience and\nmolecular biology. So one task for philosophers moving forward is to\nassess whether or not similar strategies exist in other sciences,\nespecially those that operate outside the traditional laboratory, both\nin the human sciences (such as sociology and economics) and in the\nphysical sciences (such as cosmology).\nWe also expect tremendous development to come from bridging the gap\nbetween the qualitative accounts of mechanisms and mechanistic\nexplanation developed in the new mechanism and quantitative theories\nof discovery from the discipline of machine learning and causal\nmodeling (Spirtes et al. 2000; Pearl 2009). The latter offer tools to\nmine correlational data for causal dependencies. Such tools might\nescape more qualitative, historical approaches and might, in fact, go\nbeyond the common strategies that scientists traditionally use. Such\ntools also offer a means to assess discovery strategies by exploring\nthe conditions under which they succeed and fail and the efficiency\nwith which they deliver verdicts on causal hypotheses.\n7. Conclusion\nThe new mechanical philosophy and, more generally, attention to the\nframework concept of \u201cmechanism\u201d has expanded rapidly over\nthe last two decades bringing with it new orientations toward a wide\nrange of issues in the philosophy of science. Yet it is clear that\nmany of the major topics are only beginning to develop, leaving a lot\nof work for scholars to elaborate the basic commitments of this\nframework and to consider what it means to do science outside of that\nframework.  The near future is likely to see continued discussion of\nthe implications and limits of this framework for thinking about\nscience and scientific practice.",
