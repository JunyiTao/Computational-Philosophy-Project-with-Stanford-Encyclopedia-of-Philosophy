The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries\n\nIsaac\n Barrow[17]\n (1630\u201377) was one of the first mathematicians to grasp the\nreciprocal relation between the problem of quadrature and that of\nfinding tangents to curves\u2014in modern parlance, between\nintegration and differentiation. In his Lectiones Geometricae\nof 1670, Barrow observes, in essence, that if the quadrature of a\ncurve \\(y = f(x)\\) is known, with the area up to \\(x\\) given by\n\\(F(x)\\), then the subtangent to the curve \\(y = F(x)\\) is measured by\nthe ratio of its ordinate to the ordinate of the original curve.\n\nBarrow, a thoroughgoing synechist, regarded the conflict between\ndivisionism and atomism as a live issue, and presented a number of\narguments against mathematical atomism, the strongest of which is that\natomism contradicts many of the basic propositions of Euclidean\ngeometry.\n\nBarrow conceived of continuous magnitudes as being generated by\nmotions, and so necessarily dependent on time, a view that seems to\nhave had a strong influence on the thinking of his illustrious pupil\nIsaac\n Newton[18]\n (1642\u20131727). Newton\u2019s meditations during the plague year\n1665\u201366 issued in the invention of what he called the\n\u201cCalculus of Fluxions\u201d, the principles and methods of\nwhich were presented in three tracts published many years after they\nwere written: De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum\ninfinitas; Methodus fluxionum et serierum infinitarum;\nand De quadratura curvarum. Newton\u2019s approach to the\ncalculus rests, even more firmly than did Barrow\u2019s, on the\nconception of continua as being generated by motion.\n\nBut Newton\u2019s exploitation of the kinematic conception went much\ndeeper than had Barrow\u2019s. In De Analysi, for example,\nNewton introduces a notation for the \u201cmomentary increment\u201d\n(moment)\u2014evidently meant to represent a moment or\ninstant of time\u2014of the abscissa or the area of a curve, with the\nabscissa itself representing time. This\n\u201cmoment\u201d\u2014effectively the same as the infinitesimal\nquantities previously introduced by Fermat and Barrow\u2014Newton\ndenotes by \\(o\\) in the case of the abscissa, and by \\(ov\\) in the\ncase of the area. From the fact that Newton uses the letter \\(v\\) for\nthe ordinate, it may be inferred that Newton is thinking of the curve\nas being a graph of velocity against time. By considering the moving\nline, or ordinate, as the moment of the area Newton established the\ngenerality of and reciprocal relationship between the operations of\ndifferentiation and integration, a fact that Barrow had grasped but\nhad not put to systematic use. Before Newton, quadrature or\nintegration had rested ultimately \u201con some process through which\nelemental triangles or rectangles were added together\u201d (Baron\n1969 [1987: 268]), that is, on the method of indivisibles.\nNewton\u2019s explicit treatment of integration as inverse\ndifferentiation was the key to the integral calculus.\n\nIn the Methodus fluxionum Newton makes explicit his\nconception of variable quantities as generated by motions, and\nintroduces his characteristic notation. He calls the quantity\ngenerated by a motion a fluent, and its rate of generation a\nfluxion. The fluxion of a fluent \\(x\\) is denoted by\n\\(\\dot{x}\\), and its moment, or \u201cinfinitely small increment\naccruing in an infinitely short time \\(o\\)\u201d, by \\(\\dot{x}\no\\). The problem of determining a tangent to a curve is transformed\ninto the problem of finding the relationship between the fluxions\n\\(\\dot{x}\\) and \\(\\dot{z}\\) when presented with an equation\nrepresenting the relationship between the fluents \\(x\\) and \\(z\\). (A\nquadrature is the inverse problem, that of determining the fluents\nwhen the fluxions are given.) Thus, for example, in the case of the\nfluent \\(z = x^n\\), Newton first forms \\(\\dot{z} + \\dot{z} o =\n(\\dot{x} + \\dot{x} o)^n\\), expands the right-hand side using the\nbinomial theorem, subtracts \\(z = x^n\\), divides through by \\(o\\),\nneglects all terms still containing \\(o\\), and so obtains \\(\\dot{z} =\nnx^{n-1} \\dot{x}\\).\n\nNewton later became discontented with the undeniable presence of\ninfinitesimals in his calculus, and dissatisfied with the dubious\nprocedure of \u201cneglecting\u201d them. In the preface to\nthe De quadratura curvarum he remarks that there is no\nnecessity to introduce into the method of fluxions any argument about\ninfinitely small quantities. In their place he proposes to employ what\nhe calls the method of prime and ultimate ratio. This method,\nin many respects an anticipation of the limit concept, receives a\nnumber of allusions in Newton\u2019s celebrated Principia\nmathematica philosophiae naturalis of 1687.\n\nNewton developed three approaches for his calculus, all of which he\nregarded as leading to equivalent results, but which varied in their\ndegree of rigor. The first employed infinitesimal quantities which,\nwhile not finite, are at the same time not exactly zero. Finding that\nthese eluded precise formulation, Newton focussed instead on their\nratio, which is in general a finite number. If this ratio is known,\nthe infinitesimal quantities forming it may be replaced by any\nsuitable finite magnitudes\u2014such as velocities or\nfluxions\u2014having the same ratio. This is the method of fluxions.\nRecognizing that this method itself required a foundation, Newton\nsupplied it with one in the form of the doctrine of prime and ultimate\nratios, a kinematic form of the theory of limits.\n\nThe philosopher-mathematician G. W. F.\n Leibniz[19]\n (1646\u20131716) was greatly preoccupied with the problem of the\ncomposition of the continuum\u2014the \u201clabyrinth of the\ncontinuum\u201d, as he called it. Indeed we have it on his own\ntestimony that his philosophical\nsystem\u2014monadism\u2014grew from his struggle with the\nproblem of just how, or whether, a continuum can be built from\nindivisible elements. Leibniz asked himself: if we grant that each\nreal entity is either a simple unity or a multiplicity, and that a\nmultiplicity is necessarily an aggregation of unities, then under what\nhead should a geometric continuum such as a line be classified? Now a\nline is extended and Leibniz held that extension is a form of\nrepetition, so, a line, being divisible into parts, cannot be a (true)\nunity. It is then a multiplicity, and accordingly an aggregation of\nunities. But of what sort of unities? Seemingly, the only candidates\nfor geometric unities are points, but points are no more than\nextremities of the extended, and in any case, as Leibniz knew, solid\narguments going back to Aristotle establish that no continuum can be\nconstituted from points. It follows that a continuum is neither a\nunity nor an aggregation of unities. Leibniz concluded that continua\nare not real entities at all; as \u201cwholes preceding\ntheir parts\u201d they have instead a purely ideal character. In this\nway he freed the continuum from the requirement that, as something\nintelligible, it must itself be simple or a compound of simples.\n\nLeibniz held that space and time, as continua, are ideal, and anything\nreal, in particular matter, is discrete, compounded of simple unit\nsubstances he termed monads.\n\nAmong the best known of Leibniz\u2019s doctrines is the\nPrinciple or Law of Continuity. In a somewhat\nnebulous form this principle had been employed on occasion by a number\nof Leibniz\u2019s predecessors, including Cusanus and Kepler, but it\nwas Leibniz who gave to the principle \n\n\na clarity of formulation which had previously been lacking and perhaps\nfor this reason regarded it as his own discovery. (Boyer 1939 [1959:\n217]) \n\n\nIn a letter to Bayle of 1687, Leibniz gave the following formulation\nof the principle: \n\n\nin any supposed transition, ending in any terminus, it is permissible\nto institute a general reasoning in which the final terminus may be\nincluded. (quoted in Boyer 1939 [1959: 217] which cites Leibniz,\nEarly Mathematical Manuscripts, p. 147)\n\n\nThis would seem to indicate that Leibniz considered\n\u201ctransitions\u201d of any kind as continuous. Certainly he held\nthis to be the case in geometry and for natural processes, where it\nappears as the principle Natura non facit saltus. According\nto Leibniz, it is the Law of Continuity that allows geometry and the\nevolving methods of the infinitesimal calculus to be applicable in\nphysics. The Principle of Continuity also furnished the chief grounds\nfor Leibniz\u2019s rejection of material atomism.\n\nThe Principle of Continuity also played an important underlying role\nin Leibniz\u2019s mathematical work, especially in his development of\nthe infinitesimal calculus. Leibniz\u2019s essays Nova\nMethodus of 1684 and De Geometria Recondita of 1686 may\nbe said to represent the official births of the differential and\nintegral calculi, respectively. His approach to the calculus, in which\nthe use of infinitesimals, plays a central role, has combinatorial\nroots, traceable to his early work on derived sequences of numbers.\nGiven a curve determined by correlated variables \\(x, y\\), he wrote\n\\(\\Dx\\) and \\(\\Dy\\) for infinitesimal differences, or\ndifferentials, between the values \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): and\n\\(\\Dy/\\Dx\\) for the ratio of the two, which he then took to represent\nthe slope of the curve at the corresponding point. This suggestive, if\nhighly formal procedure led Leibniz to evolve rules for calculating\nwith differentials, which was achieved by appropriate modification of\nthe rules of calculation for ordinary numbers.\n\nAlthough the use of infinitesimals was instrumental in Leibniz\u2019s\napproach to the calculus, in 1684 he introduced the concept of\ndifferential without mentioning infinitely small quantities, almost\ncertainly in order to avoid foundational difficulties. He states\nwithout proof the following rules of differentiation:\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) is constant, then  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\D a & = 0\\\\\n\\D (ax) & = a \\Dx\\\\\n\\D (x+y-z) & = \\Dx  + \\Dy  - \\D z\\\\\n\\D (xy)  & = x \\Dy  + y \\Dx  \\\\\n\\D (x/y) & = \\frac{[- x \\Dy  + y \\Dx ]}{y^2}\\\\\n\\D (x^p) & = px^{p-1}\\Dx\\text{, also for fractional \\(p\\)}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nBut behind the formal beauty of these rules\u2014an early\nmanifestation of what was later to flower into differential\nalgebra\u2014the presence of infinitesimals makes itself felt, since\nLeibniz\u2019s definition of tangent employs both infinitely small\ndistances and the conception of a curve as an infinilateral\npolygon.\n\nLeibniz conceived of differentials \\(\\Dx , \\Dy\\) as variables ranging\nover differences. This enabled him to take the important step of\nregarding the symbol \\(\\D\\) as an operator acting on\nvariables, so paving the way for the iterated application of\n\\(\\D \\), leading to the higher differentials \\(\\D\\Dx = \\D^2 x\\),\n\\(\\D^3 x = \\D\\D^2 x\\), and in general \\(\\D^{n+1}x = \\D\\D^{n}x\\).\nLeibniz supposed that the first-order differentials \\(\\Dx\\),\n\\(\\Dy\\),\u2026. were incomparably smaller than, or infinitesimal\nwith respect to, the finite quantities \\(x\\), \\(y\\),\u2026, and, in\ngeneral, that an analogous relation obtained between the\n\\((n+1)^{\\textrm{th}}\\)-order differentials \\(\\D^{n+1}x\\) and the\n\\(n^{\\textrm{th}}\\)-order differentials \\(\\D^n x\\). He also assumed\nthat the \\(n^{\\textrm{th}}\\) power \\((\\Dx )^n\\) of a first-order\ndifferential was of the same order of magnitude as an\n\\(n^{\\textrm{th}}\\)-order differential \\(\\D^{n} x\\), in the sense that\nthe quotient \\(\\D^{n} x/(\\Dx )^n\\) is a finite quantity.\n\nFor Leibniz the incomparable smallness of infinitesimals derived from\ntheir failure to satisfy Archimedes\u2019 principle; and quantities\ndiffering only by an infinitesimal were to be considered equal. But\nwhile infinitesimals were conceived by Leibniz to be incomparably\nsmaller than ordinary numbers, the Law of Continuity ensured that they\nwere governed by the same laws as the latter.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s attitude toward infinitesimals and differentials seems\nto have been that they furnished the elements from which to fashion a\nformal grammar, an algebra, of the continuous. Since he regarded\ncontinua as purely ideal entities, it was then perfectly consistent\nfor him to maintain, as he did, that infinitesimal quantities\nthemselves are no less ideal\u2014simply useful fictions, introduced\nto shorten arguments and aid insight.\n\nAlthough Leibniz himself did not credit the infinitesimal or the\n(mathematical) infinite with objective existence, a number of his\nfollowers did not hesitate to do so. Among the most prominent of these\nwas Johann Bernoulli (1667\u20131748). A letter of his to Leibniz\nwritten in 1698 contains the forthright assertion that \u201cinasmuch\nas the number of terms in nature is infinite, the infinitesimal exists\nipso facto\u201d (Boyer 1939 [1959: 239], quoting Leibniz,\nMathematische Schriften, III (Part 2), 555). One of his\narguments for the existence of actual infinitesimals begins with the\npositing of the infinite sequence 1/2, 1/3, 1/4,\u2026. If there are\nten terms, one tenth exists; if a hundred, then a hundredth exists,\netc.; and so if, as postulated, the number of terms is infinite, then\nthe infinitesimal exists.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s calculus gained a wide audience through the\npublication in 1696, by Guillaume de L\u2019H\u00f4pital\n(1661\u20131704), of the first expository book on the subject, the\nAnalyse des Infiniments Petits Pour L\u2019Intelligence des\nLignes Courbes. This is based on two definitions:\n\nVariable quantities are those that continually increase or\ndecrease; and constant or standing quantities are those that continue\nthe same while others vary.\nThe infinitely small part whereby a variable quantity is\ncontinually increased or decreased is called the differential of that\nquantity.\n\n\nAnd two postulates:\n\nGrant that two quantities, whose difference is an infinitely small\nquantity, may be taken (or used) indifferently for each other: or\n(what is the same thing) that a quantity, which is increased or\ndecreased only by an infinitely small quantity, may be considered as\nremaining the same.\nGrant that a curve line may be considered as the assemblage of an\ninfinite number of infinitely small right lines: or (what is the same\nthing) as a polygon with an infinite number of sides, each of an\ninfinitely small length, which determine the curvature of the line by\nthe angles they make with each other.\n\n\nFollowing Leibniz, L\u2019H\u00f4pital writes \\(\\Dx\\) for the\ndifferential of a variable quantity \\(x\\). A typical application of\nthese definitions and postulates is the determination of the\ndifferential of a product \\(xy\\): \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\D (xy) & = (x + \\Dx )(y +\\Dy ) - xy \\\\\n& = y \\Dx  + x \\Dy  + \\Dx  \\Dy  \\\\\n& = y \\Dx  + x \\Dy .\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nHere the last step is justified by Postulate I, since \\(\\Dx \\Dy\\) is\ninfinitely small in comparison to \\(y \\Dx + x \\Dy\\).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s calculus of differentials, resting as it did on\nsomewhat insecure foundations, soon attracted criticism. The attack\nmounted by the Dutch physician Bernard\n Nieuwentijdt[20]\n (1654\u20131718) in works of 1694\u20136  is of particular interest,\nsince Nieuwentijdt offered his own account of infinitesimals which\nconflicts with that of Leibniz and has striking features of its own\n(see Mancosu 1996: 158\u2013160).  Nieuwentijdt postulates a domain\nof quantities, or numbers, subject to a ordering relation of greater\nor less. This domain includes the ordinary finite quantities, but it\nis also presumed to contain infinitesimal and infinite\nquantities\u2014a quantity being infinitesimal, or infinite, when it\nis smaller, or, respectively, greater, than any arbitrarily given\nfinite quantity. The whole domain is governed by a version of the\nArchimedean principle to the effect that zero is the only quantity\nincapable of being multiplied sufficiently many times to equal any\ngiven quantity. Infinitesimal quantities may be characterized as\nquotients \\(b/m\\) of a finite quantity \\(b\\) by an infinite quantity\n\\(m\\). In contrast with Leibniz\u2019s differentials,\nNieuwentijdt\u2019s infinitesimals have the property that the product\nof any pair of them vanishes; in particular each infinitesimal is\nnilsquare, i.e., its square and all higher powers are zero\n(see Mancosu 1996: 159). This fact enables Nieuwentijdt to show that,\nfor any curve given by an algebraic equation, the hypotenuse of the\ndifferential triangle generated by an infinitesimal abscissal\nincrement \\(e\\) coincides with the segment of the curve between \\(x\\)\nand \\(x + e\\). That is, a curve truly is an infinilateral\npolygon.\n\nThe major differences between Nieuwentijdt\u2019s and Leibniz\u2019s\ncalculi of infinitesimals are summed up in the following table:\n\n\nLeibniz\nNieuwentijdt \n\nInfinitesimals are variables\nInfinitesimals are constants \n\nHigher-order infinitesimals exist\nHigher-order infinitesimals do not exist \n\nProducts of infinitesimals are not absolute zeros\nProducts of infinitesimals are absolute zeros \n\nInfinitesimals can be neglected when infinitely small with\nrespect to other quantities\n(First-order) infinitesimals can never be neglected \n\n\nIn responding to Nieuwentijdt\u2019s assertion that squares and\nhigher powers of infinitesimals vanish, Leibniz objected that it is\nrather strange to posit that a segment \\(\\Dx\\) is different from zero\nand at the same time that the area of a square with side \\(\\Dx\\) is\nequal to zero (Mancosu 1996: 161). Yet this oddity may be regarded as\na consequence\u2014apparently unremarked by Leibniz himself\u2014of\none of his own key principles, namely that curves may be considered as\ninfinilateral polygons. Consider, for instance, the curve \\(y = x^2\\).\nGiven that the curve is an infinilateral polygon, the infinitesimal\nstraight stretch of the curve between the abscissae 0 and \\(\\Dx\\) must\ncoincide with the tangent to the curve at the origin\u2014in this\ncase, the axis of abscissae\u2014between these two points. But then\nthe point \\((\\Dx , \\Dx ^2)\\) must lie on the axis of abscissae, which\nmeans that \\(\\Dx ^2 = 0\\).\n\nNow Leibniz could retort that that this argument depends crucially on\nthe assumption that the portion of the curve between abscissae 0 and\n\\(\\Dx\\) is indeed straight. If this be denied, then of course it does\nnot follow that \\(\\Dx ^2 = 0\\). But if one grants, as Leibniz does,\nthat that there is an infinitesimal straight stretch of the curve (a\nside, that is, of an infinilateral polygon coinciding with the curve)\nbetween abscissae 0 and \\(e\\), say, which does not reduce to a single\npoint then \\(e\\) cannot be equated to 0 and yet the above argument\nshows that \\(e^2 = 0\\). It follows that, if curves are infinilateral\npolygons, then the \u201clengths\u201d of the sides of these latter\nmust be nilsquare infinitesimals. Accordingly, to do full justice to\nLeibniz\u2019s (as well as Nieuwentijdt\u2019s) conception,\ntwo sorts of infinitesimals are required: first,\n\u201cdifferentials\u201d obeying\u2014as laid down by\nLeibniz\u2014the same algebraic laws as finite quantities; and second\nthe (necessarily smaller) nilsquare infinitesimals which measure the\nlengths of the sides of infinilateral polygons. It may be said that\nLeibniz recognized the need for the first, but not the second type of\ninfinitesimal and Nieuwentijdt, vice-versa. It is of interest to note\nthat Leibnizian infinitesimals (differentials) are realized in\nnonstandard analysis, and nilsquare infinitesimals in smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis (for both types of analysis see below). In fact\nit has been shown to be possible to combine the two approaches, so\ncreating an analytic framework realizing both Leibniz\u2019s and\nNieuwentijdt\u2019s conceptions of infinitesimal.\n\nThe insistence that infinitesimals obey precisely the same algebraic\nrules as finite quantities forced Leibniz and the defenders of his\ndifferential calculus into treating infinitesimals, in the presence of\nfinite quantities, as if they were zeros, so that, for\nexample, \\(x + \\Dx\\) is treated as if it were the same as \\(x\\). This\nwas justified on the grounds that differentials are to be taken as\nvariable, not fixed quantities, decreasing continually until reaching\nzero. Considered only in the \u201cmoment of their\nevanescence\u201d, they were accordingly neither something nor\nabsolute zeros.\n\nThus differentials (or infinitesimals) \\(\\Dx\\) were ascribed variously\nthe four following properties:\n\n\\(\\Dx \\approx 0\\)\nneither \\(\\Dx = 0\\) nor \\(\\Dx \\ne 0\\)\n\\(\\Dx ^2 = 0\\)\n\\(\\Dx \\rightarrow 0\\)\n\n\nwhere \u201c\\(\\approx\\)\u201d stands for \u201cindistinguishable\nfrom\u201d, and \u201c\\(\\rightarrow 0\\)\u201d stands for\n\u201cbecomes vanishingly small\u201d. Of these properties only the\nlast, in which a differential is considered to be a variable quantity\ntending to 0, survived the nineteenth century refounding of the\ncalculus in terms of the limit\n concept.[21]\n\nThe leading practitioner of the calculus, indeed the leading\nmathematician of the eighteenth century, was Leonhard\n Euler[22]\n (1707\u201383). Philosophically Euler was a thoroughgoing synechist.\nRejecting Leibnizian monadism, he favored the Cartesian doctrine that\nthe universe is filled with a continuous ethereal fluid and upheld the\nwave theory of light over the corpuscular theory propounded by\nNewton.\n\nEuler rejected the concept of infinitesimal in its sense as a quantity\nless than any assignable magnitude and yet unequal to 0, arguing: that\ndifferentials must be zeros, and \\(\\Dy/\\Dx\\) the quotient \\(0/0\\).\nSince for any number \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\alpha \\cdot 0 = 0\\), Euler\nmaintained that the quotient \\(0/0\\) could represent any number\n whatsoever.[23]\n For Euler qua formalist the calculus was essentially a\nprocedure for determining the value of the expression \\(0/0\\) in the\nmanifold situations it arises as the ratio of evanescent\nincrements.\n\nBut in the mathematical analysis of natural phenomena, Euler, along\nwith a number of his contemporaries, did employ what amount to\ninfinitesimals in the form of minute, but more or less concrete\n\u201celements\u201d of continua, treating them not as atoms or\nmonads in the strict sense\u2014as parts of a continuum they must of\nnecessity be divisible\u2014but as being of sufficient minuteness to\npreserve their rectilinear shape under infinitesimal flow,\nyet allowing their volume to undergo infinitesimal change.\nThis idea was to become fundamental in continuum mechanics.\n\nWhile Euler treated infinitesimals as formal zeros, that is, as fixed\nquantities, his contemporary Jean le Rond d\u2019Alembert\n(1717\u201383) took a different view of the matter. Following\nNewton\u2019s lead, he conceived of infinitesimals or differentials\nin terms of the limit concept, which he formulated by the assertion\nthat one varying quantity is the limit of another if the second can\napproach the other more closely than by any given quantity.\nD\u2019Alembert firmly rejected the idea of infinitesimals as fixed\nquantities, and saw the idea of limit as supplying the methodological\nroot of the differential calculus. For d\u2019Alembert the language\nof infinitesimals or differentials was just a convenient shorthand for\navoiding the cumbrousness of expression required by the use of the\nlimit concept.\n\nInfinitesimals, differentials, evanescent quantities and the like\ncoursed through the veins of the calculus throughout the eighteenth\ncentury. Although nebulous\u2014even logically suspect\u2014these\nconcepts provided, faute de mieux, the tools for deriving the\ngreat wealth of results the calculus had made possible. And while,\nwith the notable exception of Euler, many eighteenth century\nmathematicians were ill-at-ease with the infinitesimal, they would not\nrisk killing the goose laying such a wealth of golden mathematical\neggs. Accordingly they refrained, in the main, from destructive\ncriticism of the ideas underlying the calculus. Philosophers, however,\nwere not fettered by such constraints.\n\nThe philosopher George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), noted both for his\nsubjective idealist doctrine of esse est percipi and his\ndenial of general ideas, was a persistent critic of the\npresuppositions underlying the mathematical practice of his day\n(Jesseph 1993). His most celebrated broadsides were directed at the\ncalculus, but in fact his conflict with the mathematicians went\ndeeper. For his denial of the existence of abstract ideas of any kind\nwent in direct opposition with the abstractionist account of\nmathematical concepts held by the majority of mathematicians and\nphilosophers of the day. The central tenet of this doctrine, which\ngoes back to Aristotle, is that the mind creates mathematical concepts\nby abstraction, that is, by the mental suppression of\nextraneous features of perceived objects so as to focus on properties\nsingled out for attention. Berkeley rejected this, asserting that\nmathematics as a science is ultimately concerned with objects of\nsense, its admitted generality stemming from the capacity of percepts\nto serve as signs for all percepts of a similar form.\n\nAt first Berkeley poured scorn on those who adhere to the concept of\ninfinitesimal. maintaining that the use of infinitesimals in deriving\nmathematical results is illusory, and is in fact eliminable. But later\nhe came to adopt a more tolerant attitude towards infinitesimals,\nregarding them as useful fictions in somewhat the same way as did\nLeibniz.\n\nIn The Analyst of 1734 Berkeley launched his most sustained\nand sophisticated critique of infinitesimals and the whole metaphysics\nof the calculus. Addressed To an Infidel\n Mathematician,[24]\n the tract was written with the avowed purpose of defending theology\nagainst the scepticism shared by many of the mathematicians and\nscientists of the day. Berkeley\u2019s defense of religion amounts to\nthe claim that the reasoning of mathematicians in respect of the\ncalculus is no less flawed than that of theologians in respect of the\nmysteries of the divine.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s arguments are directed chiefly against the Newtonian\nfluxional calculus. Typical of his objections is that in attempting to\navoid infinitesimals by the employment of such devices as evanescent\nquantities and prime and ultimate ratios Newton has in fact violated\nthe law of noncontradiction by first subjecting a quantity to an\nincrement and then setting the increment to 0, that is, denying that\nan increment had ever been present. As for fluxions and evanescent\nincrements themselves, Berkeley has this to say:\n\n\nAnd what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments?\nAnd what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite\nquantities nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we\nnot call them the ghosts of departed quantities? (1734: 59)\n\n\nNor did the Leibnizian method of differentials escape Berkeley\u2019s\nstrictures.\n\nThe opposition between continuity and discreteness plays a significant\nrole in the philosophical thought of Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804).\nHis mature philosophy, transcendental idealism, rests on the\ndivision of reality into two realms. The first, the\nphenomenal realm, consists of appearances or objects of\npossible experience, configured by the forms of sensibility and the\nepistemic categories. The second, the noumenal realm,\nconsists of \u201centities of the understanding to which no objects\nof experience can ever correspond\u201d (K\u00f6rner 1955: 94), that\nis, things-in-themselves.\n\nRegarded as magnitudes, appearances are spatiotemporally extended and\ncontinuous, that is infinitely, or at least limitlessly, divisible.\nSpace and time constitute the underlying order of phenomena, so are\nultimately phenomenal themselves, and hence also continuous.\n\nAs objects of knowledge, appearances are continuous extensive\nmagnitudes, but as objects of sensation or perception they are,\naccording to Kant, intensive magnitudes. By an intensive\nmagnitude Kant means a magnitude possessing a degree and so\ncapable of being apprehended by the senses: for example brightness or\ntemperature. Intensive magnitudes are entirely free of the intuitions\nof space or time, and \u201ccan only be presented as\nunities\u201d. But, like extensive magnitudes, they are\ncontinuous. Moreover, appearances are always presented to the senses\nas intensive magnitudes.\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) Kant brings a new\nsubtlety (and, it must be said, tortuousity) to the analysis of the\nopposition between continuity and discreteness. This may be seen in\nthe second of the celebrated Antinomies in that work, which concerns\nthe question of the mereological composition of matter, or extended\nsubstance. Is it (a) discrete, that is, consists of simple or\nindivisible parts, or (b) continuous, that is, contains parts within\nparts ad infinitum? Although (a), which Kant calls the\nThesis and (b) the Antithesis would seem to\ncontradict one another, Kant offers proofs of both assertions. The\nresulting contradiction may be resolved, he asserts, by observing that\nwhile the antinomy \u201crelates to the division of\nappearances\u201d, the arguments for (a) and (b) implicitly treat\nmatter or substance as things-in-themselves. Kant concludes that both\nThesis and Antithesis \u201cpresuppose an inadmissible\ncondition\u201d and accordingly \u201cboth fall to the ground,\ninasmuch as the condition, under which alone either of them can be\nmaintained, itself falls\u201d.\n\nKant identifies the inadmissible condition as the implicit taking of\nmatter as a thing-in-itself, which in turn leads to the mistake of\ntaking the division of matter into parts to subsist independently of\nthe act of dividing. In that case, the Thesis implies that the\nsequence of divisions is finite; the Antithesis, that it is infinite.\nThese cannot both be true of the completed (or at least\ncompletable) sequence of divisions which would result from taking\nmatter or substance as a\n thing-in-itself.[25]\n Now since the truth of both assertions has been shown to follow from\nthat assumption, it must be false, that is, matter and\nextended substance are appearances only. And for appearances, Kant\nmaintains, divisions into parts are not completable in experience,\nwith the result that such divisions can be considered, in a startling\nphrase, \u201cneither finite nor infinite\u201d.  It follows that,\nfor appearances, both Thesis and Antithesis are false.\n\nLater in the Critique Kant enlarges on the issue of\ndivisibility, asserting that, while each part generated by a sequence\nof divisions of an intuited whole is given with the whole, the\nsequence\u2019s incompletability prevents it from forming a\nwhole; a fortiori no such sequence can be claimed to be\nactually infinite.\n",
