    "main_text": "The early dialogues: Examining life || The aporetic procedure\n2.1 The aporetic procedure\n\r\nThe early \u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues are not concerned with the\r\nquestion of the good life and its conditions in general but rather\r\nwith particular virtues. Socrates explores these virtues through\r\ndiscussions with persons who are regarded either as representatives\r\nof, or claim to be experts on, that virtue. Socrates\u2019\r\njustification for this procedure is that a paragon or expert must know\r\nthe property that characterizes his particular virtue and must,\r\ntherefore, be able to give an account or definition of it (cf. Xenophon\r\nMemorabilia I, 10; 16). Thus, in the Euthyphro,\r\nSocrates discusses piety/holiness with an alleged \u2018expert\u2019\r\non religious affairs. In the Laches, he discusses courage\r\nwith two renowned generals in the Peloponnesian war, Laches and\r\nNicias. Similarly, in the Charmides, Socrates\r\naddresses \u2013 somewhat ironically \u2013 the nature of moderation\r\nwith two of the later Thirty Tyrants, namely with the then very young\r\nCharmides, an alleged model of modesty, and his guardian and\r\nintellectual mentor, Critias. In the Greater Hippias, Socrates\r\nraises the question of the nature of the beautiful with a producer of\r\n\u2018beautiful things\u2019, the sophist and polymath Hippias. In\r\nthe Protagoras, Socrates focuses on the question of the unity\r\nof virtue in a discussion with Protagoras, the most famous teacher of\r\n\u2018civic virtues\u2019 among the sophists. And in the\r\nGorgias, Socrates discusses the nature of rhetoric and its\r\nrelation to virtue with the most prominent teacher of rhetoric among\r\nthe sophists. Finally, in the Meno, the question of how virtue\r\nas such is acquired is raised by Meno, a disciple of Gorgias and an\r\nambitious seeker of power, wealth, and fame, who later met a gruesome\r\ndeath in Persia in the pursuit of those very values.\n\r\nSocrates\u2019 interlocutors are usually, at first, quite confident\r\nabout their own competence in the discussion. And such confidence\r\nis not unreasonable. If virtue is a kind of \u2018skill\u2019 or a special\r\nproperty that enjoys general recognition, its possessor should know\r\nand be able to give an account of that skill or proficiency. As\r\nSocrates\u2019 examinations demonstrate, however, such\r\nself-confidence is usually unfounded, and the \u2018knowledge\u2019\r\nprofessed by Socrates\u2019 partners is revealed to be, at best, an\r\nimplicit familiarity. When they are confronted with their inability to\r\nexplain the nature of their cherished virtue or expertise, they end up\r\nadmitting their ignorance, but often with considerable chagrin or\r\nanger (on the \u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues, see the entry in\r\nSEP Plato\u2019s Shorter Ethical Works by\r\nPaul Woodruff). Socrates\u2019 purpose in conducting these sometimes\r\ncruel-looking games is not just to undermine the false confidence of\r\nhis interlocutors but also to pave the way towards general\r\ndefinitions and standards concerning the virtues. There were no widely\r\nacknowledged standards of definition in Socrates\u2019 time, but by\r\nexposing the flaws in his partners\u2019 abortive arguments in his\r\ninvestigations, Socrates contributed significantly to the development\r\nof such standards. The respective flaws vary greatly in kind and\r\ngravity: Socrates shows that enumerations of examples are not\r\nsufficient to capture the nature or essence of the virtue in question.\r\nDefinitions that consist in the replacement of the concept in question\r\nwith a synonym are open to the same objections as the original\r\ndefinition. Definitions may be hopelessly vague or miss the mark\r\nentirely, which is to say that they may be either too wide and include\r\nunwanted characteristics or subsets, or too narrow so that they\r\nexclude essential characteristics. Moreover, definitions may be\r\nincomplete because the object in question does not constitute a\r\nunitary phenomenon. If generally accepted \u2018social\r\nexcellences\u2019 are not simple conditions, they may be subject to\r\nconflicting convictions. Examples of all these problems are provided\r\nin Plato\u2019s early dialogues, where Socrates exposes the exact\r\nnature of the underlying deficiencies with more or less diagnostic\r\ntransparency.\n\r\nGiven that the focus in the early dialogues is almost entirely on the\r\nexposure of flaws and inconsistencies, one cannot help wondering\r\nwhether Plato himself knew the answers to his queries and\r\nhad some cards up his sleeve that he chose not to play for the time\r\nbeing. This would presuppose that Plato had not only a clear notion of\r\nthe nature of the different virtues but also a definitive conception\r\nof the good life as such. Since Plato was neither a moral nihilist nor\r\na sceptic, he cannot have regarded moral perplexity (aporia)\r\nas the ultimate end, nor regarded continued mutual examination,\r\nSocratico more, as a way of life for everyone. Perplexity, as\r\nis argued in the Meno, is just a wholesome intermediary stage\r\non the way to knowledge (Me. 84a\u2013b). But if Plato\r\nassumes that the convictions that survive Socratic questioning will\r\neventually coalesce into a coherent account of the good life, then he\r\nkeeps this expectation to himself. Nor would such optimism seem\r\nwarranted, given Socrates\u2019 disavowal of knowledge. There is no\r\nguarantee that only false convictions are refuted in a Socratic\r\ncross-examination, while true ones are retained \u2013 for promising\r\nsuggestions are often as mercilessly discarded as their less promising\r\nbrethren. Perhaps Plato counted on his readers\u2019 intelligence to\r\nstraighten out what is skewed in Socratic refutations, as well as to\r\ndetect unfair moves and to supplement what is missing. It is, in\r\nfact, often not difficult to make out problematic or fallacious moves\r\nin Socrates\u2019 argument and to correct them, but such corrections\r\nmust remain incomplete without sufficient information about\r\nPlato\u2019s overall conception of the good life and its moral\r\npresuppositions at that point in time. It is, therefore, a matter of\r\nconjecture whether Plato himself held any positive views while he\r\ncomposed one aporetic dialogue after the other. He may have regarded\r\nhis investigations as experimental stages or have seen each dialogue\r\nas an element in a network of approaches that he hoped to integrate\r\neventually.\n\r\nIf there is a general lesson to be drawn from the many failed accounts\r\nof the virtues by Socrates\u2019 different partners, beyond the\r\nparticular shortcomings of individual definitions and assertions, it\r\nis that isolated definitions of single virtues, summed up in one\r\nsentence, will not do. The evidence that Plato wanted his readers to\r\ndraw this very conclusion already in his early dialogues is somewhat\r\ncontradictory, however. He famously pleads for the unity of the\r\nvirtues in the Protagoras and seems intent to reduce them\r\nall to knowledge. Scholars are, therefore, wont to speak of the\r\n\u2018intellectualistic\u2019 character of the so-called\r\n\u2018Socratic ethics\u2019 because it leaves no room for other\r\nmotivational forces, such as desires and emotions. Socrates\u2019\r\nproof in the Protagoras that reason cannot be overcome by the\r\npassions has, from Aristotle on, been treated as a denial of\r\nakrasia, of the phenomenon that was later somewhat\r\nmisleadingly dubbed as \u2018weakness of the will\u2019. This\r\nintellectualizing tendency does not tell us, however, what kind of\r\nmaster-science would fulfill all of the requirements for defining\r\nvirtues, nor what its content should be. Moreover, the emphasis on\r\nknowledge does not rule out an awareness on Plato\u2019s part of the\r\nimportance of other factors, even in his early dialogues. Though Plato\r\noften compares the virtues with technical skills, such as those of a\r\ndoctor or a pilot, he may have realized that virtues also involve\r\nemotional attitudes, desires, and preferences but not yet have seen a\r\nclear way to coordinate or combine the rational and the affective\r\nelements that constitute the virtues. In the Laches, for\r\ninstance, Socrates\u2019 partners struggle when they try to define\r\ncourage, invoking two different elements. In his attempt to define\r\ncourage as \u2018steadfastness in battle\u2019, Laches, one of the\r\ntwo generals and \u2018experts\u2019 on courage, is faced with the\r\ndilemma that steadfastness seems not to be a satisfactory definition\r\nof courage either in itself or in combination with knowledge\r\n(La. 192a\u2013194c). His comrade Nicias, on the other hand,\r\nfails when he tries to identify courage exclusively as a certain type\r\nof knowledge (197e\u2013200a). The investigation of moderation in the\r\nCharmides, likewise, points up that there are two disparate\r\nelements commonly associated with that virtue \u2013 namely, a\r\ncertain calmness of temper on the one hand (Chrm.\r\n158e\u2013160d) and self-knowledge on the other (166e\u2013175a). It\r\nis clear that a complex account would be needed to combine these two\r\ndisparate features, for moral skills not only presuppose sufficient\r\n\u2018operative\u2019 rationality but also require appropriate\r\nevaluative and emotional attitudes towards the ends to be attained and\r\ntowards the means to be employed. Such an insight is at least\r\nindicated in Socrates\u2019 long and passionate argument in the\r\nGorgias against Polus and Callicles that the just life is\r\nbetter for the soul of its possessor than the unjust life, an argument\r\nthat he fortifies with a mythical depiction of the soul\u2019s reward\r\nand punishment after death (523a\u2013527e). But the nature of\r\njustice, and what is required for the proper care of one\u2019s soul,\r\nis thereby illuminated only indirectly. For the most part,\r\nSocrates\u2019 interrogations focus on the incompatibility of his\r\ninterlocutors\u2019 selfish aims with their more selfless and noble\r\ntendencies. In his earlier dialogues, Plato may or may not already be\r\nenvisaging the kind of solution that he is going to present in the\r\nRepublic to the problem of the relationship between the\r\ndifferent virtues, with wisdom, the only purely intellectual virtue,\r\nas their basis. Courage, moderation, and justice presuppose a certain\r\nsteadfastness of character as well as a harmony of purpose between the\r\ndisparate parts of the soul, but their goodness depends entirely on\r\nthe intellectual part of the soul, just as the virtue of the citizens\r\nin the just state depends on the wisdom of the philosopher kings\r\n(R. 428a\u2013444e). The existence of \u2018demotic\u2019\r\nvirtues of character is thus acknowledged, but they are relegated to\r\nsecond place (500d; 522a\u2013b).\n\r\nThere are at least some indications that Plato already saw the need\r\nfor a holistic conception of the good life when he composed his\r\n\u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues. At the end of the Laches,\r\nhe lets Nicias founder in his attempt to define courage as the\r\n\u2018knowledge of what is to be feared and what should inspire\r\nconfidence\u2019. Nicias is forced to admit that such knowledge\r\npresupposes the knowledge of good and bad tout court\r\n(La. 199c\u2013e). In a different but related way, Socrates\r\nalludes to a comprehensive knowledge at the end of the\r\nCharmides. In his final refutation of Critias\u2019\r\ndefinition of moderation as \u2018knowledge of knowledge\u2019, he\r\nurges that this type of knowledge is insufficient for the happy life\r\nwithout the knowledge of good and bad (Chrm. 174b\u2013e).\r\nPointing out what is wrong or missing in particular arguments is a far\r\ncry from a philosophical conception of the ultimate good in human\r\nlife. But the fact that Plato insists on the shortcomings of a purely\r\n\u2018technical\u2019 conception of virtue suggests that he was at\r\nleast facing up to these problems. The discussion of the \u2018unity\r\nof the virtues\u2019 in the Protagoras \u2013 regardless of\r\nthe probably intentionally unsatisfactory structure of its proofs\r\n\u2013 confirms that Plato realized that a critique of the\r\ninconsistencies implied in conventional values is insufficient to\r\njustify such a unitary point of view. Nevertheless, the evidence that\r\nPlato already had a unified conception of the good life in mind when\r\nhe wrote his earlier dialogues remains, at most, indirect.\n",
