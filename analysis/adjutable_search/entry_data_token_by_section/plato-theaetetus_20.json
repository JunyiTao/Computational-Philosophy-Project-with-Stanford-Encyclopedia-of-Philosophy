Third Definition (D3): \u201cKnowledge is True Judgement With an Account\u201d: 201d\u2013210a\n\n\nTheaetetus\u2019 third proposal about how to knowledge is\n(D3) that it is true belief with an account (meta\nlogou al\u00eath\u00ea doxan).\n\n\nD3 apparently does nothing at all to solve the main\nproblems that D2 faced. Besides the jurymen\ncounter-example just noted, 187\u2013201 showed that we could not define\nknowledge as true belief unless we had an account of\nfalse belief. This problem has not just evaporated in\n201\u2013210.  It will remain as long as we propose to define knowledge as\ntrue belief plus anything. Significantly, this does not seem to bother\nPlato\u2014as we might expect if Plato is not even trying to offer an\nacceptable definition of knowledge, but is rather undermining\nunacceptable definitions.\n\n\nOne crucial question about Theaetetus 201\u2013210 is the question\nwhether the argument is concerned with objectual or propositional\nknowledge. This is a basic and central division among interpretations\nof the whole passage 201\u2013210, but it is hard to discuss it properly\nwithout getting into the detail of the Dream Theory: see section\n8a.\n\n\nA second question, which arises often elsewhere in the\nTheaetetus, is whether the argument\u2019s appearance of\naporia reflects genuine uncertainty on Plato\u2019s part, or is\nrather a kind of literary device. Is Plato thinking aloud, trying to\nclarify his own view about the nature of knowledge, as Revisionists\nsuspect? Or is he using an aporetic argument only to smoke out his\nopponents, as Unitarians think?\n\n\nThe evidence favours the latter reading. There are a significant\nnumber of other passages where something very like Theaetetus\u2019 claim\n(D3) that knowledge is \u201ctrue belief with an\naccount\u201d is not only discussed, but actually defended: for\ninstance, Meno 98a2, Phaedo 76b5\u20136, Phaedo\n97d\u201399d2, Symposium 202a5\u20139, Republic 534b3\u20137, and\nTimaeus 51e5. So it appears that, in the Theaetetus,\nPlato cannot be genuinely puzzled about what knowledge can be. Nor can\nhe genuinely doubt his own former confidence in one version of\nD3. If he does have a genuine doubt or puzzle of this\nsort, it is simply incredible that he should say what he does say in\n201\u2013210 without also expressing it.\n\n\nWhat Plato does in 201\u2013210 is: present a picture (Socrates\u2019 Dream) of\nhow things may be if D3 is true (201c\u2013202c); raise\nobjections to the Dream theory which are said (206b12) to be decisive\n(202c\u2013206c); and present and reject three further suggestions about\nthe meaning of logos, and so three more versions of\nD3 (206c\u2013210a). But none of these four\ninterpretations of D3 is Plato\u2019s own earlier version\nof D3, which says that knowledge = true belief with\nan account of the reason why the true belief is true. If what\nPlato wants to tell us in Theaetetus 201\u2013210 is that he no\nlonger accepts any version of D3, not even\nhis own version, then it is extraordinary that he does not even\nmention his own version, concentrating instead on versions of\nD3 so different from Plato\u2019s version as to be\nobviously irrelevant to its refutation.\n\n\nUnitarians can suggest that Plato\u2019s strategy is to refute what he\ntakes to be false versions of D3 so as to increase\nthe logical pressure on anyone who rejects Plato\u2019s version of\nD3. In particular, he wants to put pressure on the\nempiricist theories of knowledge that seem to be the main target of\nthe Theaetetus. What Plato wants to show is, not only that no\ndefinition of knowledge except his own, D3, is\nacceptable, but also that no version of D3 except his\nown is acceptable.\n",
