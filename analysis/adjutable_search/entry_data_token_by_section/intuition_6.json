    "main_text": "The Epistemological Role of Intuitions || The Method of Cases\n2.2 The Method of Cases\n\nConsider the following paradigmatic examples of contemporary\nphilosophical reasoning in which a philosophical theory is taken to be\nprima facie undermined by contradicting an intuition\nregarding a particular hypothetical case:\n\nThe Gettier Case (Gettier 1963):\nSuppose that Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job. Smith\nbelieves, on the basis of strong evidence, that Jones will get the job\nand also that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. He infers from this\nthat the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.\nHowever, imagine that, unknown to Smith, he himself, not Jones, will\nget the job. And, also unknown to Smith, he himself has ten coins in\nhis pocket.\nGettier Intuition: Smith does not know\nthat the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.\nJustified True Belief Theory of\nKnowledge: S knows that p IFF S has a\njustified true belief that p.\nThe Transplant Case (Thomson 1976):\nSuppose that you are a transplant surgeon and that you now have\nfive patients, each in need of a different organ in order to prevent\nimminent and certain death. You also have a suitable donor in your\nhospital for a routine check-up. If you were to involuntarily (and secretly) take her\norgans and transplant them into the needy five, you are certain to\nbring about her death but also to prevent the death of the five.\n Transplant Intuition: It is not\nmorally permissible to take the organs of the one in order to save the\nfive.\n Act Utilitarian Theory of Morality:\nAction A is morally right IFF A maximizes\nwell-being.\nThe Chinese Nation Case (Block 1978)\nSuppose that the citizens of China are organized so as to be\nfunctionally equivalent to a human brain and to interact with a\nhuman-like body in a manner functionally equivalent to that in which\nthe brain interacts with the human body.\nChinese Nation Intuition: The nation of\nChina, so organized, would lack qualia (i.e., there would be nothing\nit would be like to be the nation of China).\nFunctionalist Theory of Mind: S\nhas mental state M IFF S contains a realization of\nfunctional state F.\nThe Flagpole Case (Bromberger 1966)\nSuppose that a flagpole is standing on level ground in bright\nsunshine. From a specification of the length of the flagpole\u2019s\nshadow and the height of the sun in the sky one can, given the\nrelevant laws of optics, deduce the height of the flagpole.\nFlagpole Intuition: The height of the\nflagpole is not explained by the length of its shadow.\nDeductive-Nomological Theory of\nExplanation: E is an explanation of F IFF E\nis a set of truths which deductively implies F and the\ndeduction relies essentially on a nomic generalization.\n\n\nSuch examples could easily be multiplied to include teletransportation\nand fission cases in the literature on personal identity, preemption\nand epiphenomena cases in the literature on causation and explanation,\nclairvoyance and evil demon cases in epistemology, Newcomb cases in\ndecision theory, Frankfurt cases in the literature on free will,\nTwin-Earth and Swampman cases in the literature on mental content,\nJackson\u2019s Mary case in the metaphysics of mind, trolley cases in\napplied ethics, experience machine cases in normative ethics, and many\nmany others.\n\nIn each such instance, the fact that the theory or generalization in\nquestion contravenes the content of an intuition is treated as\n(defeasible) evidence against the theory or generalization. As well,\nthe fact that a theory implies results which agree with intuitions is\ncommonly taken to constitute prima facie support for the\ntheory. (See the supplementary document\n \u201cThe Logical Structure of the Method of Cases\u201d\n for further discussion of the logical structure of such\nreasoning.)\n\nThis use of intuitions is, perhaps, even clearer if we consider what\nseems to be a contrast between philosophical methodology and that of\nthe natural sciences. An empirical scientist must engage in empirical\nobservation of some sort in an order to confirm or disconfirm the\ntheories with which her discipline is engaged. If judged by her\npractice, the philosopher, by contrast, appears able to proceed\nlargely or entirely from the armchair. If one takes the evidence to\nwhich natural science is primarily responsive to be that produced by\nempirical observation, it seems that philosophical (and other) inquiry\nproceeding from the armchair must have some other (putative)\nevidential basis. A natural (though contested) suggestion is that\nintuitions are treated as the primary evidence in philosophical\ninquiry.\n\n(Some contemporary discussion of the methodology and epistemology of\nthe appeal to particular hypothetical cases treats them as\n\u201cthought experiments\u201d and endeavors to draw analogies\nbetween the role of such cases in philosophical inquiry and the role\nof thought experiments in empirical science (Horowitz and Massey 1991;\nSorensen 1992). This analogy is not pursued here for reasons outlined\nin\n \u00a71.3.)\n",
