    "main_text": "Majority Cultural Rights Claims || Cultural continuity and integration enforcement rights\n3.2 Cultural continuity and integration enforcement rights\n\nStates that defend the right of cultural continuity at the level of\nadmission to a state typically also deploy the right to adopt and\nenforce \u201cintegration\u201d policies that encourage newcomers to\nadopt majority\u00a0norms and values, arguing that the faster such\nadoption happens, the more rapid admission itself can be. Integration\npolicies ask newcomers to adopt the norms and practices of the\nmajority community, whereas accommodation policies ask the majority to\naccommodate practices that are distinct from those that define the\nmajority\u2019s culture. On this conventional multicultural view, the\nprocess by which migrants are admitted to the territory, and then to\nmembership, is a \u201ctwo-way\u201d street, requiring that both\nnewcomers and the host state adapt in response to each other (Kymlicka\n1998).\n\nIs the demand that newcomers integrate culturally reasonable?\nIs it reasonable, that is, to ask immigrants to adopt the norms,\nvalues, and practices that are central to the culture they have joined\n(l will leave aside the question of economic and political\nintegration, here)? Notice that in the political and sociological\nliterature in immigration incorporation, integration (culturally) is\ntypically distinguished from assimilation, where the former focuses on\nwelcoming newcomers with the distinct sets of norms and values that\ntravel with them (and so accommodating them where possible), and the\nlatter demands that immigrants adopt as fully as possible the set of\nnorms and values that are central to the host society (Brubaker 2001;\nsee also Modood 2007). In the political theory literature on\nmulticulturalism, however, it is widely accepted that a demand for\nfull assimilation is normatively problematic (it requires too much of\nimmigrants, to abandon their histories and identities, as part of\njoining a new community), but\u00a0that some form of encouragement to\nintegrate is permissible.\n\nWhether the integration demands are permissible depends on at least\ntwo connected things, however: first, on the content of the shared\npublic culture and, second, on the accessibility of the venues in\nwhich the content of this public culture is deliberated. The space in\nwhich a culture is deliberated is amorphous as well as expansive. The\nsource of key norms, practices, and values is multi-fold: some are\nhistorical, some are deliberately adopted through political processes,\nsome are accidentally adopted in response to contingent\ncircumstances.\u00a0The demand that newcomers integrate, in the sense\nof adopt the norms and practices of the majority culture to at least a\nreasonable extent is more defensible in cases where access to spaces\nin which they are deliberated is public and therefore open to\nmany voices. The precise meaning of \u201caccessibility\u201d to\nspaces that are not clearly defined, and entry to which is not\nmonitored or policed in any formal way, is challenging to pin down.\nBut the key point is that to the extent that cultures welcome and take\nseriously new voices\u2014in public media, in political spaces, and\nso on\u2014they can be described as publicly accessible. So, there is\na connection between the legitimacy of demanding adherence to majority\nculture norms and practices, as part of the process of integration,\nand the genuine access that newcomers have to the spaces in which they\nare deliberated.\n\nIn considering the second question, with respect to the content of a\nmajority\u2019s shared public culture, I borrow from the literature\nin the political theory of nationalism (though I do not believe that\nthe language of nationalism itself is essential to appreciate\nits relevance to the discussion here). A culture can be defined by\nfeatures that are more or less inclusive. Where cultures are defined\nby characteristics that are typically used to describe ethnic nations,\nincluding shared history, religion, ethnicity/race, newcomers are less\neasily able to join them and be recognized as full members. Where\ncultures are defined by characteristics that are typically used, on\nthe other hand, to describe civic nations, including shared commitment\nto political institutions and, usually, a commitment to liberal\ndemocratic principles, then they are more welcoming for newcomers. In\nthe language adopted earlier in this entry, cultures that are defined\nby exclusive features are more likely to treat culture as\nencompassing, whereas cultures that adopt inclusive features, and\nemphasize accessibility to the forums in which its content is\ndeliberated, treat culture in dialogic or identity terms. This need\nnot be the case, though, since those who treat culture in dialogic\nterms may nevertheless believe that key elements of history or\nreligion are central to it (though they are open to deliberation about\nthe appropriateness of these elements as central) and similarly\nidentities can be formulated on the basis of exclusionary\nfeatures.\n\nAnother way to define inclusivity focuses attention on the extent to\nwhich\u00a0a culture\u2019s main norms, practices, and values can be\nadopted by newcomers without their giving up something they\nvalue (Lenard 2019). Key here is to define the permissible contours of\nan inclusive culture that, at the same time, can serve to distinguish\nit from others in ways that resolve what philosophers have called the\n\u201cparticularity\u201d problem. If cultures are defined\nonly by commitment to liberal democratic principles and the\ninstitutions that instantiate them, then a person will necessarily be\ncommitted to any state that is so defined. But this conclusion does\nnot make sense of the reality that many citizens are attached to\ntheir state\u2019s interpretation of these\nvalues\u2014fundamental, abstract, liberal democratic\nprinciples\u00a0are adopted, respected, and instantiated, in other\nwords, in a culturally specific way. It is important, then, to\ndelineate the boundary of permissible cultural content, which can\ninclude recognition of key historical moments, or political\nconversations, or cultural icons. No state can demand of newcomers\nthat their emotional commitment be to their new state; but it can\nreasonably impart information about learnable key cultural markers,\nencourage newcomers to adopt the associated practices and norms, and\nhope that over time their emotional identification shifts to the host\nstate, at least partially (Carens 2005). Under the condition that the\npublic cultural content of a host state is reasonably\naccessible, and that the forums in which it is deliberated are\nlikewise reasonably accessible, then the host state can\npermissibly\u00a0encourage the integration of newcomers. This right is\nperhaps best understood as derivative of the right to cultural\ncontinuity that states claim in relation to immigration, which\ncan\u00a0permissibly be claimed if and only if the accessibility\nconditions described above are met.\n\nNot all scholars agree on this point, of course, and some reject\nentirely the suggestion\u00a0that newcomers can be asked to make\naccommodations to the culture of the state that they have joined.\nThose who adopt variants on this view treat the majority\u2019s\nculture as nearly always homogeneous and oppressive in ways that are\ndisrespectful of newcomers, and treat the demand for integration along\nat least some dimensions as \u201ccleaned up\u201d variations on the\ndiscriminatory and racist immigration policies of the past (Abizadeh\n2002). This is a real worry. When the Netherlands demanded that\npotential migrants from majority Muslim countries watch a video and\npass a test merely to gain entry to its territory\u2014a video that\nshowed gay men kissing and a topless woman\u2014it was widely\nexcoriated for its discriminatory intent, rather than (as was claimed)\nan attempt to ensure that migrants could adopt the liberal values that\nsupposedly characterized the country\u2019s culture. More generally,\nthe mechanisms of encouraging the learning and adoption of the\nmajority culture\u2019s values, in addition to its actual content as\ndelineated above, as well as the consequences for failure to do so,\nmust be scrutinized for their reasonableness. This assessment is a\ntricky business, certainly, made trickier because in many (if not\nmost) immigration situations, the potential newcomer is in a situation\nof vulnerability in relation to the host state: their interest in\ngaining entry is very strong and so in many cases, they will accept\nheavy-handed attempts to coerce their integration\u00a0without\ncomplaint.\n",
