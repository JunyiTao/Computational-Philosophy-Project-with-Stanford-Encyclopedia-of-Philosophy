    "main_text": "Twenty-First-Century Alternatives: A New Epigenesis? || Developmental systems and cycles\n10.1 Developmental systems and cycles\n\nSusan Oyama\u2019s monograph The Ontogeny of Information\n(1985 [2000a]) critiques gene-based theories of development. She\nargues that genetic information for development is causally\nderivative, existing as such only in the context of an ongoing\ndevelopmental process. That process, in all its contingency and\nhistorical specificity, is causally primary. Neither DNA nor\nenvironmental factors are causes of development outside the\ninteractive context that makes features of the physical world an\norganism\u2019s environment and induces patterns of gene activation\nwithin cells. Genetic information emerges from the interactions of\nheterogeneous, dispersed, developmental resources. Central to\nOyama\u2019s view is the\n\n\nconception of a developmental system, not as the reading off of a\npreexisting code, but as a complex of interacting influences, some\ninside the organism\u2019s skin, some external to it, and including\nits ecological niche in all its spatial and temporal aspects. (1985\n[2000a: 39])\n\n\nAs in earlier organicism, patterns and form emerge from ongoing\ninteraction, within and among multiple levels of organization, on\nmultiple time-scales. But unlike the organicists, Oyama has an\nestablished theoretical alternative to contend with. Much of her\nargument is negative, rejecting the gene/environment dichotomy,\nprimacy of genes as causes, and lingering preformationism of the idea\nof a genetic program for development. Her theoretical perspective aims\nto overcome entrenched (and often unrecognized) dichotomies in\nbiological thought. Although criticized for their complexity, apparent\nincompatibility with scientific generalization, and lack of connection\nto experimental practices, Oyama\u2019s ideas about developmental\nsystems have been influential in twenty-first-century philosophy of\nbiology.\n\nOne impact is further articulation of developmental systems theory\n(DST; see the entries on \n inheritance systems\nand\n replication and reproduction). \n In the introduction to\ntheir 2001 edited volume, Cycles of Contingency, Oyama, Paul\nGriffiths, and Russell Gray set out DST\u2019s major themes and\ncommitments: joint determination by multiple causes (causal parity),\ncontext sensitivity and contingency, extended inheritance, development\nas construction, distributed control, and evolution as construction.\nAnother core tenet is rejection of opposed dualities such as\nnature/nurture, gene/environment, and biology/culture\u2014not\narguing that an adequate theory of development must include both sides\nof opposition, but that the oppositions themselves have no place in an\nadequate theory of development. Relatedly, genes are not privileged\ncauses of development (Griffiths & Knight 1998). This\n\u201cparity thesis\u201d is sometimes misunderstood as a\ntheoretical claim that all causes of development are equally\nimportant. But it is better understood as a constraint on theories of\ndevelopment (and evolution): to not presuppose any fundamental\ndistinction between genes and all other causes (Oyama et al. 2001: 3).\nDST\u2019s other themes are similarly arrayed against\ntwentieth-century predeterminism. In this way, DST entails a\nconceptual reorientation in thinking about inheritance, development,\nand evolution, and a point of departure for philosophical exploration\nof alternatives to gene-centrism and entrenched dichotomies. Much of\nthis research focuses on integrating development and\nevolution\u2014i.e., evo-devo theories (see the entry on\n evolution and development).\n DST-affiliated projects that focus on organismal development are\ndiscussed here.\n\nA developmental system is\n\n\na heterogeneous and causally complex mix of interacting entities and\ninfluences that produces the life cycle of an organism. (Oyama 2000b:\n1)\n\n\nJames Griesemer (2000a, 2000b, 2014a, 2014b) further articulates this\nidea by conceptualizing development as part of a more general theory\nof reproduction (see the entry on\n replication and reproduction).\n In this theory,\n\n\ndevelopment is the acquisition of the capacity to reproduce, where\nreproduction involves material propagation of developmental capacities\nfrom parents to offspring. (2014b: 199)\n\n\nIf development is so conceived,\n\n\n\u2026then it turns out all traditional life cycles are\ncomplex\u2026[i.e.] there is typically at least one substantial\nchange of developmental context or niche, with multiple generations of\nprogenerants, before a life cycle is completed. (2014b:\n191\u2013192)\n\n\nComplex life cycles of parasites and viruses, then, are not\nidiosyncratic but rather exemplars of complex, context-dependent\ndevelopmental processes. Griesemer\u2019s theoretical reorientation\ndeparts from the traditional idea of development as proceeding\nlinearly from egg to embryo to adult. Instead, developmental\ncapacities are properties of life cycles involving multiple organismal\nforms. This motivates a new theoretical concept: scaffolding\ninteractions that bring a developing entity and aspects of the\nenvironment into such close association as to qualify as a new\n\u201chybrid\u201d entity with new developmental potentialities\n(Griesemer 2014a). The original entity and environment are as\n\u201cparents\u201d to the new \u201chybrid\u201d developmental\nsystem (e.g., HIV integrated into host genome vs. free virus and\nuninfected human cell/genome). Genes are demoted to \u201ca special\nkind of evolved class of scaffolding developmental mechanisms\u201d\n(2014b: 198).\n\nBiologist Alessandro Minelli (2009, 2014) endorses a similar view of\ndevelopment, arguing that the first step toward a satisfactory theory\nis characterizing the full range of developmental processes, beyond\nthe traditional \u201cadultocentric perspective\u201d tracing the\nformation of a mature organism from an egg cell. Although Minelli does\nnot theorize development in terms of reproducers, he does\nconceptualize the process in terms of life cycles (see also Bonner\n1974). Life cycles can be multigenerational, multigenomic,\nunicellular\u2014and so developmental processes include these too,\nimplicating haploid stages in sexually-reproducing organisms,\nalternation of generations, mixed sexual/asexual reproduction as in\ncolonial tunicates and plants, etc. Minelli proposes to use this\nexpanded view of \u201cdevelopmental disparity\u201d, encompassing\nthe full range of diversity of life cycles of living things, alongside\n\u201ctraditional, or na\u00efve, concepts of development\u201d to\narrive at a satisfactory general framework (2014: 228).\n\nJason Scott Robert (2004) extends Oyama\u2019s critique of the\nprevailing view that\n\n\ndevelopment is now standardly construed as the epigenesis of something\npreformed in the DNA. (2004: 35)\n\n\nThis combination of old theoretical opposites, he argues, is\nunbalanced in favor of preformationism. Robert proposes instead\n\u201ccreative development\u201d:\n\n\nthe organism\u2019s semi-autonomous self-constitution from a range of\nontogenetic raw materials,\n\n\nco-constructed with its environment (2004: 87). Burian (2005)\nsimilarly challenges the adequacy of genetic determinism for\nunderstanding development, arguing that experimental results better\nsupport multilevel causation. Although grounded in experimental\npractices and associated concepts rather than abstract theory,\nBurian\u2019s arguments motivate search for new theories to account\nfor robustness of developmental processes and outcomes.\n",
