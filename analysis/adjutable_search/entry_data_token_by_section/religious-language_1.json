    "main_text": "The Content of Religious Utterances\n2. The Content of Religious Utterances\n\nAlthough Ayer\u2019s version of verificationism is one of the most\nwell-known rejections of (a*), his approach is unusual in two\nrespects. First, he offers no positive alternative account of the\nmeaning of religious utterances. Ayer saw little value in religious\ndiscourse and preferred its elimination. In contrast, the other\ntheories considered in this section propose that religious language\nmay be meaningful even if it does not express religious propositions.\nVarious options have been proposed: it may express non-cognitive\nstates, have a practical value in modifying the thought and action of\nspeakers, or represent non-religious facts. Second, Ayer\u2019s\naccount is ostensibly comprehensive for religious language whereas\nmost other theories are more piecemeal, that is, they reject (a*) for\nsome significant subclass of religious utterances but for other\nreligious utterances accept face value theory.\n",
