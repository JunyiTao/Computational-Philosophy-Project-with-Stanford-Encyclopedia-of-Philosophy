    "main_text": "Normative conceptions of the person || The Zhuangzi\n2.6 The Xunzi\n\nThe Xunzi (references to the Chinese text will be to\nXunzi in CTP) is named after Xun Kuang (\u8340\u6cc1, c.\n310\u2013c. 220 BCE). It further develops the Confucian tradition of\nappealing to authority of a leader to conceptualize the role of the\nheart-mind. Xunzi was a synthetic thinker, and his work shows\ninfluence from and response to the Mohists, the Daoists, Zhuangzi in\nparticular, and Mengzi who becomes a foil in chapter 23\n\u201cXing E\u201d (Human nature is bad). Xunzi takes\nConfucius teaching about the role of ritual and music in moral\ncultivation more seriously than does Mengzi\u2019s focus on innate\nmoral knowledge.\n\nIn the \u201cCorrect Naming\u201d (Zheng Ming\n\u6b63\u540d) chapter, Xunzi identifies what emerges in our lives\nas our nature (xing \u6027). This nature includes our\ncapacity to register sense distinctions accessed in the real world\nthrough the five sensory faculties. Our nature also includes liking,\ndisliking, happiness, anger, sadness and joy which we call\n\u201cdispositions\u201d (qing \u60c5). The qing\nreacts to events in the world and the heart-mind deems what is\npermissible or impermissible to seek through deliberating (lv\n\u616e). When the heart reflects and one\u2019s abilities act on\nit, this is called \u201cdeliberate effort\u201d (\u507d\nwei).\n\n\nThat which comes into being through accumulated reflection and\ntraining of one\u2019s abilities is also called \u201cdeliberate\neffort\u201d. (Xunzi 22.2 [trans. 2014: 236])\n\n\nSocial things and activities are measured by utility, and behavior\n(\u884c xing walking) is measured by morality. That by\nwhich people understand things is called \u201cthe\nunderstanding\u201d (zhi \u77e5), and when the\nunderstanding connects to things it is called \u201cknowledge\u201d\n(zhi \u667a). The ability to do things is called\n\u201cability\u201d (neng \u80fd) . To do things well, we\ncorrectly sort parts of the world into named categories according to\ntheir similarities and differences. Xunzi shares with the Mozi and the\nDaoists a conception of knowledge as practical know-how.\n\nTo correctly sort things, one must use the names for them consistently\nand with clarity:\n\n\nIf the names and their corresponding objects are tied together in a\nconfused fashion, then the distinction between noble and base will not\nbe clear, and the like and the unlike will not be differentiated\n\u2026 Thus, the wise person draws differences and establishes names\nin order to point out their corresponding objects. Most importantly,\nhe makes clear the distinction between noble and base, and more\ngenerally, he distinguishes the like and the unlike. (Xunzi\n22.4 [trans. 2014: 237])\n\n\nTo explain how one achieves comprehensive clarity, Xunzi draws from\nZhuangzi\u2019s account of the \u60c5 qing as the basis of\nchoosing. Xunzi adopts the concept of emptiness (xu \u865b)\nto talk about being receptive to impressions and keeping memories of\nearlier learning from interfering with this receptivity. He similarly\nadapts Daoist unity (yi \u58f9) as bringing all one\u2019s\ndiverse impressions into a harmonious whole in which none obscure\nothers; Daoist tranquility (jing \u975c) is remaining calm and\nalert, not swept away by the plethora of thoughts and perceptions,\nstimulation or even \u201cirritation\u201d (characterizations of the\nthree concepts from Stalnaker 2003: 90\u201391; see Xunzi\nCTP: 21.8 [trans. 2014: 228]).\n\nWhat Xunzi omits from Zhuangzi, however, is the idea that bodily\nqi plays a crucial role in providing avenues to the\nworld\u2019s structure that plug into the deliberating heart-mind.\nXunzi recommends the three states of heart-mind to equip it in picking\nout, sorting, and systematizing. Xunzi is also less open than Zhuangzi\nto the possibilities of alternate conceptualizations of the\nenvironment for behavior. He takes for granted that there are just the\nsimilarities and differences in things that our concepts register.\nSorting them correctly just is using the established, conventional\nnames correctly. Direct realism must not be confused with\nXunzi\u2019s doctrine.\n\nNames are conventionally established to stand for object types. With\nthem, we can communicate with distant peoples. There is no inherent\nproperty of a name that suits it to be the name of what is\nconventionally established to be its referent. Once established,\nhowever, there must not be competing accounts of its referent until it\nis disestablished (e.g., by a \u201cLater King\u201d) in favor of\nanother, purportedly better, name for common use in picking out a\nnatural kind.\n\nIn the \u201cDiscourse on Heaven\u201d chapter (Xunzi CTP\n17.4: Tian Lun \u5929\u8ad6 [trans. 2014: 176]),\nTian is said to give human beings their inborn dispositions,\nthe sensory faculties, and the heart-mind for controlling these\nfaculties to act as their lord. In the \u201cUndoing Fixation\u201d\nchapter (Jie Bi \u89e3\u853d) the heart-mind is said to\nbe the lord (jun \u541b) of the body, to be the one to\nissue orders but taking orders from no other part (Xunzi 21.9\n[trans. 2014: 229]). The next chapter \u201cCorrect Naming\u201d\ngoes on to say, however, that\n\n\nDeeming something permissible and guiding one are what the\nunderstanding must provide. Thus, even were one a gatekeeper, the\ndesires cannot be eliminated, because they are the necessary equipment\nof the nature. Even if one were the Son of Heaven, one\u2019s desires\ncannot be completely satisfied. Even though the desires cannot be\ncompletely satisfied, one can get close to complete satisfaction. Even\nthough desires cannot be eliminated, one\u2019s seeking can be\nregulated. Even though what is desired cannot be completely obtained,\nthe seeker can approach complete fulfillment. Even though desires\ncannot be eliminated, when what is sought is not obtained, one who is\nreflective desires to regulate his seeking. When the Way advances,\nthen one approaches complete fulfillment. (Xunzi CTP: 22.15\n[trans. adapted from 2014: 244]).\n\n\nThe import of this passage seems to be that Xunzi\u2019s way brings\nthe society of seekers close to fulfilling desire by regulating\nseeking, not, as Laozi had suggested, by forgetting desires\nalong with names. The understanding takes satisfaction of desire as\nthe basis for social regulation of seeking behavior with the aim of\nmaximizing satisfaction of desire.\n\nXunzi\u2019s normative development of this picture of human nature,\ndesire, and government compares to Mill\u2019s classification of\npleasures. His \u201cheavy\u201d vs. \u201clight\u201d are like\nMill\u2019s \u201chigher and lower\u201d pleasures\u2014metaphors\nfor making good judgments about superior versus inferior desire\nsatisfactions. One problem posed by the text is how Xunzi can validate\nthis classification on the naturalistic grounds with which he started\nhis account of the hear-mind, feelings, and pleasure so it does not\nlook like arbitrary declaration from the \u201cregulator of\nseeking\u201d.\n\nHis most notorious chapter \u201c[Human] Nature is Bad\u201d\n(Xunzi 23 Xing E \u6027\u60e1) seems an attempt\nto derive the ranking from natural assumptions. Human nature is bad,\nhe says, and goodness is a result of deliberate effort. People are\nborn with a fondness for benefit, and if they follow along with this,\nstruggle and contention arise. This inference seems to presuppose\npsychological egoism and Xunzi would be alone among the Classical\nmasters in taking selfishness to be natural. That interpretation,\nhowever, is controversial. Others find greater continuity with Mengzi\nthan the title slogan suggests.\n\nHowever, he goes on to list inborn feelings of envy and dislike and\nsight and sound \u201cdesires\u201d. The former lead to cruelty and\nvillainy and the latter to licentiousness. It is only through\ntransforming nature using teachers and models daoing ritual\nand traditional mores (yi), that human beings can be shaped\nto be yielding and deferent to proper order and end up becoming\ncontrolled. Rituals (and traditional music) and yi (ritual\nmores) generated by the sage kings are the only ones suited for the\ntask of reshaping human beings to be compliant and deferent to proper\nauthority and order. This is the context for making sense of\nXunzi\u2019s striking crafts metaphor: reshaping natural dispositions\nis like steaming and straightening crooked wood on the shaping frame,\nor honing and grinding blunt metal until it becomes sharp (CTP: 23.2\n[trans. 2014: 248]). Thus, morality is not part of\nTian\u2019s order, but something set up by the sage-kings to\ncorrect what is dangerous and unruly in people\u2019s nature.\n\nThe heart-mind does not have the power to reshape natural desires and\nemotions simply through its command. Xunzi consistently stresses the\nneed for unrelenting \u201cdeliberate effort\u201d to reshape and\nbeautify people\u2019s motivational system and character. In fact, in\none famous passage, he says that the exemplary person\n\n\nrepeatedly recites his learning in order to master it (beauty),\nponders it in order to comprehend it, makes his person so as to dwell\nin it, and eliminates things harmful to it in order to nourish it. He\nmakes his eyes not want to see what is not this, makes his\nears not want to hear what is not this, makes his mouth not\nwant to speak what is not this, and makes his heart not want\nto contemplate what is not \ufeffthis. He comes to the\npoint where he loves it, and then his eyes love it more than the five\ncolors, his ears love it more than the five tones, his mouth loves it\nmore than the five flavors, and his heart considers it more beneficial\nthan having the whole empire. (Quan Xue \u52f8\u5b78 CTP:\n1.18 [trans. 2014: 18])\n\n\nIf this passages about finding far greater satisfaction and peace of\nmind in performing actions on behalf of a beauty ideal and not for the\nsake of the self is put alongside the selfish characterization of\nhuman nature, the question immediately arises how one starts with a\nnature like that and ends up in a startlingly different place. Merely\ncoming to realize the benefits to self-interest in cooperation rather\nthan conflict would be insufficient for explaining how this\ntransformation could come about (Wong 1996, 2000). Sheer persistent\neffort does not explain how interests in the self can become\ninterests in the welfare of others for their own sake.\n\nIt may be that the only plausible alternative for Xunzi to work out\nhis theory is to admit that among the inborn dispositions there is at\nleast latent and incipient interest in others as well as the\nself-concerned interests highlighted in the famous passage from the\n\u201cHuman Nature is Bad\u201d chapter. There are passages in the\ntext that seem to make this concession. In the chapter\n\u201cDiscourse on Ritual\u201d (Li Lun \u79ae\u8ad6),\nXunzi says that\n\n\nAmong all the living things between Heaven and Earth, those that have\nblood and qi are sure to have awareness, \ufeffand of those\nthat have awareness, none fails to love its own kind.\n\n\nHe gives as examples birds or beasts who become separated from their\ngroups, grow distressed, and who seek to rejoin them. Xunzi concludes\nby saying that\n\n\namong creatures that have blood and qi, none has greater\nawareness than man, and so man\u2019s feeling for his parents knows\nno limit until the day they die. (CTP: 19.26 [trans. 2014: 213]).\n\n\nThat Xunzi identifies a disposition which humans and other animals\nshare implies that it is natural. How is this consistent with\nXunzi\u2019s saying that human nature is bad? People\u2019s nature\ncan still be called bad if the self-concerned, envious and hateful\ndispositions become dominant when they get no education in\nritual and mores or when education fosters dominance of selfishness.\nHuman beings in their nature can be nurtured to behave on powerful\nimpulses that get them into endemic, destructive conflict. Human\nnature is mixed and conflicted. Absent an environment that nurtures\ncontrol of the impulses that lead to conflict, people show their worse\nsides.\n\nThus, while Xunzi appeared to postulate a strong hierarchy of the\nheart-mind over the rest of the person, the way he fills out the\npicture suggests that the heart-mind attends to the total system of\ndesires and daos a strategy for the greatest satisfaction of\nthis total. This impression is supported by the language of\n\u201cnurturing\u201d (yang \u990a) the desires arising\nfrom the natural dispositions. He concludes that rituals and rightness\nmake it possible for humans to constrain seeking behavior by dividing\nthings and ranks so that seeking never exhausts nor depletes material\ngoods (Li Lun \u79ae\u8ad6 CTP 19.1).\n\nXunzi\u2019s conception of a mixed human nature and reliance on\nsocial nurturing to reshape the natural mix brings him into sharp\ndisagreement with Mengzi about the goodness of human nature. He argues\nthat Mengzi did not distinguish nature from what, with deliberate\neffort is nurtured:\n\n\nWhat is in people\u2019s nature is not learned and cannot be worked\nat. Those things they learn and achieve through working at them are\ntheir deliberate effort. (Xing E \u6027\u60e1; CTP 23.9\n[trans. 2014: 249])\n\n\nThis sharp dichotomy rejects Mengzi\u2019s metaphor of natural\nsprouts growing into morality, benevolence and wisdom. Xunzi treats\nmoral intuition on the analogy of the natural acuity of the senses. It\nis not something that can be learned or worked at:\n\n\n\ufeffpeople\u2019s nature is such that their eyes can see, and\ntheir ears can hear. The brightness by which they see does not depart\nfrom their eyes, and the acuity by which they hear does not depart\nfrom their ears. Their eyes are simply bright, and their ears are\nsimply acute. One does not learn this brightness. (Xing E\n\u6027\u60e1; CTP: 23.4 [trans. 2014: 249])\n\n\nScientific inquiry has not been kind to this particular view of\nXunzi\u2019s, and it relates to what he does not take from Laozi and\nZhuangzi. Scientists have discovered that perception is both bottom-up\nand top-down. We receive sensory input, but the mind fills in gaps\n(e.g., the famous \u201cblind spot\u201d to preserve awareness of a\nworld as we \u201cknow\u201d it. Our conceptual scheme exerts a\ntop-down organization of the sensory input. Some of the\nclassifications we get are inborn, but most are learned from infancy\npartly from our culture and from our exploring our environment, seeing\nwhich of our guesses as to what is bringing sensory input to us are\ncorrect. Acuity of perception in Xunzi\u2019s terms, the range of\ndistinctions our senses can distinguish may be something given to us\nby Tian but the world we see is profoundly influenced by\ntop-down processes.\n\nZhuangzi can retort that different systems of names can result in\ndifferently populated and structured worlds. Contemporary conclusions\nabout the relation between nature and nurture may support\nMengzi\u2019s conception of the inborn capacity as like a sprout that\ndevelops under the right environment conditions as well as\nXunzi\u2019s emphasis on nurture. But Mengzi is also vulnerable to\nZhuangzi\u2019s insight that nurture can take nature in many\ndifferent directions, so it becomes daunting to try to sort\ntian (nature) from ren (human social nurturing).\n\nXunzi\u2019s theory of reasoning and reflection vs. emotion and\ndesire is also different from Mengzi\u2019s. However, the differences\nare nuanced and his position closer to Mengzi\u2019s than the\ntwenty-third chapter title (\u201cHuman nature is bad\u201d) would\nsuggest. Clearly, the heart-mind has a supervisory role. It determines\nwhat behaviors best promote optimal fulfillment of natural desires.\nHis language of nurturing the capacity to resist seeking satisfaction\nof certain desires, stresses the wise and foresighted desires of the\nperson. The supervisory role is ultimately geared toward the good of\nthe whole person, as is Mengzi\u2019s. The heart-mind\u2019s\neffective supervising entails paying attention to the direction and\nrhythms of our emotional life, e.g., our responses the death of a\nloved one. When the heart-mind is sensitive to the overall pattern, it\ncan select how to channel seeking behavior to achieve personal and\nsocial harmony.\n",
