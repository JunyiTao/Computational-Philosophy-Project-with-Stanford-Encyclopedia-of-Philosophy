    "main_text": "\n\nSeneca is a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period.\nAs a Stoic philosopher writing in Latin, Seneca makes a lasting\ncontribution to Stoicism. He occupies a central place in the\nliterature on Stoicism at the time, and shapes the understanding of\nStoic thought that later generations were to have. Seneca\u2019s\nphilosophical works played a large role in the revival of Stoic ideas\nin the Renaissance. Until today, many readers approach Stoic\nphilosophy through Seneca, rather than through the more fragmentary\nevidence that we have for earlier Stoics. Seneca\u2019s writings are\nstunningly diverse in their generic range. More than that, Seneca\ndevelops further and shapes several philosophical genres, most\nimportant, the letter and so-called \u201cconsolations\u201d; his\nessay On Mercy is considered the first example of what came\nto be known as the \u201cmirror of the prince\u201d literature.\n\nAfter several centuries of relative neglect, Seneca\u2019s philosophy\nhas been rediscovered in the last few decades, in what might be called\na second revival of Senecan thought. In part, this renewed interest is\nthe result of a general reappraisal of Roman culture. It is also\nfuelled by major progress that has been made in our understanding of\nGreek Hellenistic philosophy, and by recent developments in\ncontemporary ethics, such as a renewed interest in the theory of\nemotions, roles and relationships, and the fellowship of all human\nbeings. And finally, some influential scholars have found, in the wake\nof Foucault\u2019s reading of Seneca, that Seneca speaks to some\ndistinctively modern concerns.\n",
