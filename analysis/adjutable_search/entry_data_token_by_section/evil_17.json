    "main_text": "Attempted Defenses || Induction Based on Partial Success\n6.3 Induction Based on Partial Success\n Swinburne (1988, 297\u20138) argued in support of the conclusion that\ntheism does need a theodicy. In doing so, however, he noted one minor\nqualification\u2014namely, that if one could show, for a sufficiently\nimpressive range of evils that initially seemed problematic, that it\nwas likely that an omnipotent and omniscient person would be morally\njustified in not having prevented them, then one might very well be\njustified in believing that the same would be true of other evils,\neven if one could not specify, in those other cases, what the morally\nsufficient reason for allowing them might be.\n What Swinburne says here is surely very reasonable, and I can see\nno objection in principle to a defense of this sort. The problem with\nit is that no theodicy that has ever been proposed has been successful\nin the relevant way\u2014that is, there is no impressive range of\nundesirable states of affairs where people initially think that the\nwrongmaking properties of allowing such states of affairs to exist\ngreatly outweigh any rightmaking properties associated with doing so,\nbut where, confronted with some proposed theodicy, people come to\nbelieve that it would be morally permissible to allow such states of\naffairs to exist. Indeed, it is hard to find any such cases, let alone\nan impressive range.\n",
