    "main_text": "Concepts of Consciousness\n2. Concepts of Consciousness\n The term \u201cconsciousness\u201d is notoriously ambiguous and\ndifficult to define. Having origins in folk psychology,\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d has a multitude of uses that may not be\nresolvable into a single, coherent concept (Wilkes\n1984). Nevertheless, several useful distinctions among different\nnotions of consciousness have been made, and with the help of these\ndistinctions it is possible to gain some clarity on the important\nquestions that remain about animal consciousness.\n\n\nTwo ordinary senses of consciousness which are not in dispute when\napplied to animals are the sense of consciousness involved when a\ncreature is awake rather than \nasleep[4],\n or in a coma, and the sense of\nconsciousness implicated in the basic ability of organisms to perceive\nand thereby respond to selected features of their environments, thus\nmaking them conscious or aware of those features. Consciousness in\nboth these senses is identifiable in organisms belonging to a wide\nvariety of taxonomic groups (see, e.g., Mather 2008).\n\n\nA third, more technical notion of consciousness, access consciousness,\nhas been introduced by Block (1995) to capture the sense in which\nmental representations may be poised for use in rational control of\naction or speech.  This \u201cdispositional\u201d account of access\nconsciousness \u2014 the idea that the representational content is\navailable for other systems to use \u2014 is amended by Block (2005)\nto include an occurrent aspect in which the content is\n\u201cbroadcast\u201d in a \u201cglobal workspace\u201d (Baars\n1997) which is then available for higher cognitive processing tasks\nsuch as categorization, reasoning, planning, and voluntary direction\nof attention.  Block believes that many animals possess access\nconsciousness (speech is not a requirement).  Indeed, some of the\nneurological evidence cited by Block (2005) in support of the global\nworkspace is derived from monkeys. But clearly an author such as\nDescartes, who, we will see, denied speech, language, and\nrationality to animals, would also deny access consciousness to\nthem. Those who follow Davidson (1975) in denying intentional states\nto animals would likely concur.\n\n\nThere are two remaining senses of consciousness that cause more\ncontroversy when applied to animals: phenomenal consciousness\nand self-consciousness.\n\nPhenomenal consciousness refers to the qualitative,\nsubjective, experiential, or phenomenological aspects of conscious\nexperience, sometimes identified with qualia. (In this article we also\nuse the term \u201csentience\u201d to refer to phenomenal\nconsciousness.) To contemplate animal consciousness in this sense is\nto consider the possibility that, in Nagel\u2019s (1974) phrase, there\nmight be \u201csomething it is like\u201d to be a member of another\nspecies. Nagel disputes our capacity to know, imagine, or describe in\nscientific (objective) terms what it is like to be a bat, but\nhe assumes that there is something it is like. \n For many authors, Nagel\u2019s formulation of phenomenal consciousness\nas \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d serves as a reference point for what\u2019s at stake in\nthe debate on animal consciousness \u2014 in investigating whether a\ngroup of animals are conscious, the crucial question is whether\nthere is \u2018something it is like\u2019 to be those animals,\ni.e. whether there is a subjective experience of life or being for\nthem, a proprietary perspective that individuals have on their own\nperceptual, cognitive and emotive processes. \nThough some authors (including Nagel himself) have argued that the\nvery subjectivity of phenomenal consciousness makes it exceedingly\ndifficult or even impossible to investigate scientifically,\nparticularly in other species, others have proceeded by developing\nstructural and/or functional theories of consciousness, and using\nthese to argue for a particular hypothesis about the distribution of\nconsciousness among animals. Such theories will be discussed below, in\nsections 5 and 6.\n\nSelf-consciousness refers to a subject\u2019s awareness of itself,\nbut is also a notoriously ambiguous term \u2014 there are importantly\ndistinct senses in which a subject can be self-aware (see for example\nthe SEP article on Phenomenological Approaches to\nSelf-Consciousness). These include: an awareness of one\u2019s body as a\nphysical object, or as the medium of one\u2019s own perception and action\n(i.e. bodily self-awareness); awareness of one\u2019s own mental states\n(i.e. mental or experiential self-awareness); awareness of one-self as\nperceived by others, or as a member of a social group such as a\nfamily, team, or institution (i.e. social self-awareness); awareness\nof one-self as a persistent character in the narratives told by\noneself and others (i.e. narrative self-awareness). This list is far\nfrom exhaustive, and further, each listed notion is subject to\nfurther disambiguation. Hence, although on many theories self-consciousness is\ntightly related to phenomenal consciousness, proposals to this effect\ncan vary greatly in their meaning and their implications for which\nanimals might be conscious.\n\n\nThe remainder of this article deals primarily with the attribution of\nconsciousness in its phenomenal sense to animals, although there will\nbe some discussion of access consciousness, self-consciousness and\ntheory of mind in animals, especially where these have been related\ntheoretically to phenomenal consciousness \u2014 as, for instance, in\nCarruthers\u2019 (1998a,b, 2000) argument that a particular sort of mental\nself-representation is required for phenomenal consciousness.\n",
