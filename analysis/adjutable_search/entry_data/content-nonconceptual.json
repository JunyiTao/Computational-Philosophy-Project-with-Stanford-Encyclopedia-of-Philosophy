    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nAlthough some of the themes in current discussions of nonconceptual\ncontent have surfaced at various times in recent philosophical\nthinking (within the philosophy of perception, see, e.g., Dretske\n1969, 1981. Within philosophy of cognitive science, see, e.g., Stich\n1978), the notion of nonconceptual content was explicitly introduced\ninto analytical philosophy by Gareth Evans (Evans 1982). As part of\nhis general discussion of the role of information-links in making\npossible demonstrative and other types of identification, Evans\ndevelops the idea that the information yielded by the perceptual\nsystems (including somatic proprioception) is nonconceptual. This\nnonconceptual information, he argues, is initially unconscious but\nbecomes conscious when it serves as input to a thinking,\nconcept-applying, and reasoning system.\n\nEvans is not always clear whether he understands nonconceptual content\nto be a personal level or a subpersonal level phenomenon. And, in\nfact, it seems that Evans\u2019s conception of nonconceptual content\nis in at least one important way deeply antithetical to that currently\ndiscussed. Whereas much contemporary discussion of nonconceptual\ncontent is focused on the content of conscious perceptual\nstates, it looks very much as if Evans understands perceptual states\nwith nonconceptual content as being non-conscious until the\nsubject\u2019s conceptual abilities are brought to bear on them\n(Campbell 2005). Nonetheless, the general idea that there might be\nways of representing the world independent of the thinker\u2019s\nconceptual capacities has inspired other philosophers. An early,\npersonal level application of the notion is Tim Crane\u2019s paper on\nthe waterfall illusion (Crane 1988a. An illustration of the waterfall\nillusion, also known as the motion aftereffect illusion, can be found\n here).\n Crane argues that the waterfall illusion presents an experience with\na contradictory content that hence cannot have a conceptual\ncontent\u2014since conceptual contents must be consistent. This claim\nhas provoked some debate (Mellor 1988, Crane 1988b).\n\nEarly development of the notion of nonconceptual content came\nprimarily from philosophers connected with the University of Oxford\nand working within a broadly Fregean tradition. Christopher Peacocke,\nin a series of papers and then in his book on concepts (Peacocke\n1992), argued that the fineness of grain of perceptual experience\noutstrips the conceptual capacities of the perceiver (more on the\nfineness of grain argument in section\n 4.1).\n He offered a detailed theoretical framework for understanding the\nnonconceptual content of perceptual experience, which he termed\nscenario content. A rather different account of the nature of\nperceptual experience in nonconceptual terms was provided by Adrian\nCussins (Cussins 1990), who suggested that we should understand the\nnonconceptual content of experience in essentially ability-based\nterms. Cussins argued that this personal level notion of nonconceptual\ncontent is naturally complemented at the subpersonal level by a\nconnectionist cognitive architecture. Michael Martin applied the\nnotion of nonconceptual content to the study of memory (Martin 1992).\nRecent applications of the notion of nonconceptual content have\nfocused on the relation between perception and action (Hurley 1998)\nand the analysis of conscious experience (Tye 1995, 2000).\n\nOne thesis that might be held about nonconceptual content is that a\nthinker can represent the world nonconceptually without possessing\nany concepts at all. This was termed the Autonomy Thesis by\nPeacocke, who offers an argument against it in his (1992). This\nargument was challenged by Jos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez\n(Berm\u00fadez 1994) in favor of a notion of autonomous\nnonconceptual content that can be used to explain the behavior of\nnonlinguistic creatures. Peacocke was initially unconvinced by this\nline of argument (Peacocke 1994), but subsequently changed his mind\n(Peacocke 2002). Berm\u00fadez further deployed the notion of\nautonomous nonconceptual content in exploring primitive nonlinguistic\nforms of self-consciousness (Berm\u00fadez 1998). (More on the\nAutonomy Thesis in section\n 6.)\n\nThe notion of nonconceptual content has also been utilized in\nspecifying the representational contents of subpersonal states, such\nas those involved in the early stages of visual processing. Such\nstates, it is suggested, have representational contents and yet it is\nunlikely that the subject undergoing those states has the concepts\nutilized in a theoretical description of the contents of those states.\n(More on the nonconceptual character of subpersonal states in section\n 4.2.)\n Additionally, the notion of nonconceptual content has been utilized\nin the explanation of the behavior of nonlinguistic creatures or those\nthat do not employ concepts. Since, ex hypothesi, such\norganisms do not have conceptual capacities, if we are to attribute to\nthem states with representational contents at all the only contents\navailable to us are nonconceptual representational contents. (More on\nthe explanation of the behavior of nonlinguistic creatures in section\n 4.3.)\n\nThe most extensive discussion of the notion of nonconceptual content\nhas been in the philosophy of perception. Many have suggested that a\ncorrect specification of the representational contents of perception\nneed not be limited to concepts possessed by the perceiver. In other\nwords, a specification of the content of perception can be sensitive\nto how an organism perceptually represents its environment even though\nit utilizes concepts the organism need not possess. This claim is\nsupported by a variety of different considerations, some of which\nconcern the distinctive features of the phenomenology of perception\nand some which concern perception\u2019s distinctive epistemic role.\n(See section\n 4.1\n for the debate about the nonconceptual content of perception.)\n\nSome have objected to Evans\u2019s original characterization of the notion\non the grounds that whether or not a correct specification of the\nrepresentational content of some mental states is constrained by the\nconcepts possessed by the subject speaks only to the conditions a\nsubject must satisfy in order to undergo such states, rather than to\nthe nature of the state\u2019s representational content (e.g., Heck\n2000). This has led to a distinction between two forms of\nnonconceptualism\u2014\u201cstate\u201d-nonconceptualism and\n\u201ccontent\u201d-nonconceptualism. The former is concerned with the\nconditions one must meet in order to undergo a state with a given\ncontent, i.e., whether or not one must possess the concepts involved\nin specifying that content, whereas the latter is concerned with the\nnature of a mental state\u2019s content. Nonetheless, as we discuss below,\nthere is good reason to suppose that the distinction collapses, and\nthat the two forms of nonconceptualism are mutually-entailing. (See\nsection 3 for the purported\ndistinction between state and content nonconceptualism.)\n2. Nonconceptual content: An initial characterization\n\nThe notion of nonconceptual content is fundamentally contrastive. In\nelucidating it we need to start with the notion of conceptual content.\nThe paradigm case of a state with conceptual content is a\npropositional attitude such as a belief or desire. Having a\npropositional attitude involves standing in a certain relation to a\ncontent (a thought or a proposition). The content is\nwhat it is that is believed, desired, hoped for etc. Although\npropositional attitudes are ultimately directed at certain objects,\nproperties and/or relations (which yield their\ntruth-condition, and in terms of which their\ntruth-value is to be determined), it is clear that only\ncertain ways of characterizing those objects/properties/relations can\nserve to specify the content of the relevant propositional attitude.\nIt would be incorrect, for example, to characterize the content of my\ncurrent belief that my car is parked in the driveway by using the\nconcepts of particle physics to describe the state of affairs that\nwould make it true. This would be incorrect because it completely\nfails to capture how I think about the state of affairs of my car\nbeing in the driveway. The obvious question to ask, once this\npreliminary point is in play, is \u2018What constraints are imposed\nupon specifications of the content of propositional attitudes by the\nrequirement to respect the way the subject thinks about the\ntruth-condition of the relevant attitude?\u2019\n\nDifferent theories of content will respond to this question in\ndifferent ways, but the following is widely held to impose a minimal\nconstraint upon any such response.\n\nThe conceptual constraint:\n\nSpecifications of the content of a sentence or propositional attitude\nshould only employ concepts possessed by the utterer or thinker.\n\n\nCertain theories of content and concepts directly entail the\nconceptual constraint. Within a broadly Fregean tradition, for\nexample, the contents of propositional attitudes (and the meanings of\nsentences) are taken to consist of concepts\u2014and it is hard to\nsee how one can have a propositional attitude whose content is a\ncomplex of concepts without possessing each of\n them.[1]\n\nBut the conceptual constraint does not depend upon adopting any\nparticular theory of content. Its plausibility stems, rather, from the\nconjunction of two thoughts.\n\nIn specifying what a thinker believes, what a perceiver perceives\nor what a speaker is saying by uttering a certain sentence in a\nparticular context one has to be as faithful as possible to how that\nthinker, perceiver or speaker apprehends the world.\nHow a thinker, perceiver or speaker apprehends the world in having\nbeliefs about it, perceiving it or speaking about it is a function of\nthe concepts he possesses.\n\n\nThis way of motivating the conceptual constraint has been explicitly\nput forward by several authors who argue forcibly for the second\nthesis (see, for example, Peacocke 1983, McDowell 1994a, Brewer 1999,\nand No\u00eb 1999). Theorists of nonconceptual content, in contrast,\naccept the first constraint without the second. They hold that\nspecifications of content must respect the way a thinker, perceiver or\nspeaker apprehends the world and because of this they cannot\nbe circumscribed by the concepts possessed by the thinker, perceiver\nor speaker. Theorists of nonconceptual content postulate the existence\nof ways of representing the world (and hence the existence of a type\nof content) that outstrip the concepts possessed by the thinker.\n\nThe conceptual constraint can be lifted in two different ways. It can\nbe lifted globally by simply denying that any content specifications\nneed confine themselves to the concepts possessed by the\nutterer/thinker. The currently popular identification of propositions\nwith functions from possible worlds to truth values involves a\nglobal lifting of the conceptual constraint. Possible world\nsemantics is intended to apply to all propositional attitudes and it\nis obvious that few believers who are not also professional\nphilosophers will have any grip at all on the central theoretical\nconcepts of possible worlds semantics. All content comes out as\nnonconceptual content in this sense (Stalnaker\n 1998).[2]\n In terms of the two motivations identified earlier for the conceptual\nconstraint, this approach to specifying content appears to repudiate\nthe first. It holds that specifications of content need not be\nsensitive to how the speaker or thinker apprehends the world, at least\nif one thinks that such sensitivity requires a degree of aspectuality\nthat possible worlds semantics explicitly\n rejects.[3]\n\nIt is more interesting to think about what might happen if we retain\nthe first motivation, but question the second, looking for ways in\nwhich thinkers/perceivers/speakers represent the world that are not a\nfunction of the concepts they possess. There are three different\nrepresentational domains for which such a local lifting of\nthe conceptual constraint may be plausible:\n\nPerceptual states (see further\n 4.1\n below)\nRepresentational states at the subpersonal or subdoxastic level\n(see further\n 4.2\n below)\nRepresentational states of non-human animals and human infants who\ndo not seem to be concept possessors (see further\n 4.3\n below)\n\n\nOf course, the plausibility of a local lifting of the conceptual\nconstraint will be a function of how concepts are understood. In the\nfollowing we make two assumptions about concepts. These assumptions do\nnot fix a single notion of concept, but they do however determine the\nlogical space within which accounts can be developed of the\ncorrelative notions of conceptual and nonconceptual content.\n\nThe first assumption is that concepts are semantic entities rather\nthan psychological entities. Concepts are constituents of contents.\nAttitudes towards contents are psychological occurrences, but the\ncontents themselves are not psychological entities. They, and the\nconcepts they contain, are abstract\n entities.[4]\n The second assumption is that, although concepts are abstract\nentities, mastering a concept is a psychological achievement. We need\na cognitive account of what it is to master a concept, even though\nconcepts are not psychological entities.\n3. An important distinction: State vs. content nonconceptualism\n\nHeck (2000) introduces an alternative conception of the debate over\nnonconceptual content. This conception arises from an ambiguity he\nfinds in Evans (1982) and other proponents of nonconceptual content.\nHe notes that these proponents appeal to the thesis that while the\nbeliefs a person can have depend on the concepts she possesses, the\nperceptual states she can have do not. However, this thesis does not\nimmediately establish a conclusion about the contents of\nperception. It establishes only a conclusion about the conditions a\nsubject must satisfy to be in a perceptual state with some\ncontent. Prima facie, this conclusion appears to be compatible with\nthe claim that perceptual states and belief states have the same type\nof content.\n\nHeck distinguishes two different ways of drawing the\nconceptual/nonconceptual distinction. According to the\ncontent view, there is a fundamental difference between the\ntype of content that perceptual experiences can have and the type of\ncontent that beliefs and other propositional attitudes can have.\nAccording to the state view, in contrast, there need not be\nmore than one type of content. Perceptual experiences and\npropositional attitudes could have contents of the same type (in both\ncases content could be given in terms of sets of possible worlds, for\nexample). What distinguishes perceptions from propositional attitudes\non the state view is that the latter are concept-dependent while the\nformer are concept-independent. A state-type is concept-dependent just\nif it is content-bearing and it is impossible for a thinking and\nperceiving subject to be in a token state of that type without\npossessing the concepts required to specify the content of that token\nstate. In contrast, a subject can be in states of a\nconcept-independent state-type even if she lacks all or some of the\nconcepts required for an accurate specification of the relevant\n contents.[5]\n\nSeveral reasons have been proposed for considering state,\nrather than content, nonconceptualism as of primary\nimportance in the nonconceptual debate. First, as many have noted\n(Byrne 2003, 2005, Speaks 2005, Crowther 2006, Heck 2007), keeping the\nstate/content distinction in mind suggests that much of the recent\ndebate purportedly aiming at the content of perception in\nfact only concerns state-nonconceptualism. Arguments for the\nnonconceptual content of perception usually proceed via demonstration\nof the concept-independence of perception. However, this is a\ncharacteristic of state-nonconceptualism; it does not seem to entail\ncontent-nonconceptualism directly. In section\n 4.1,\n after reviewing the arguments that have been proposed for the\nnonconceptual content of perception, we will return to this\nconcern.\n\nA second reason offered for discussing nonconceptualism at the level\nof state type rather than at the level of content is that it allows\nfor a meaningful debate about nonconceptualism even if one holds that\nall content is nonconceptual. Stalnaker (1984, 1998), for example,\nargues that all content should be understood in terms of sets of\npossible worlds. If that is the case, then the difference between the\npropositional attitudes and perception should be elucidated in terms\nextrinsic to the type of content involved in these states. This can be\nachieved if we think that the propositional attitudes, but not\nperceptual states, are concept-dependent; that is, if we think that\nhaving propositional attitudes but not perceptual states requires the\nsubject of those attitudes to possess certain concepts. This reasoning\nholds equally well if one thinks that all content is conceptual. In\nsuch a case, one is forced to explain the difference between different\ntypes of content involving states in terms extrinsic to the nature of\ntheir contents; the state-view is one way of explaining this\ndistinction, by appeal to the capacities required of a subject if she\nis to undergo such states.\n\nAn additional reason that the \u201cstate\u201d view might be found\nappealing is that it allows for the commonsensical notion that the\ncontents of perception can be taken at face value to produce beliefs\nthat have the same content. If, on the other hand, one holds\nthat the content of perception is of a fundamentally different\nkind than that of belief, it is less easy to see how one can\nrespect the intuition that one believes the same thing that one\nperceives (Byrne 2005, Speaks 2005). Furthermore, it has been argued\nthat perception can play a justificatory role in the production of\nperceptual beliefs only if belief and perception involve the same kind\nof content (McDowell 1994a, 2006, Brewer 1999, 2005). This claim has\nbeen disputed (e.g., Heck 2000, Peacocke 2001a, Lerman 2010, Cahen\n2019. For more on the justificatory role of perception see section\n 4.1).\n\nThe \u201cstate\u201d view attempts to make the\nconceptual/nonconceptual distinction a distinction between types of\nstates, those that are concept-dependent and those that are\nconcept-independent. Berm\u00fadez (2007) argues that such a\ndistinction is implausible when considered independently of the\ndistinction drawn by the \u201ccontent\u201d view. The difficulty he\nidentifies with the \u201cstate\u201d view is that it is unclear\nwhat basis there might be for a distinction between concept-dependent\nand concept-independent state types other than the distinctive\ncontents of these states. That is, the \u201cstate\u201d view owes\nus some account of why some states, such as the propositional\nattitudes, are concept-dependent, whereas other states, such as\nperceptual states, are concept-independent. It seems that a natural\nexplanation for why perceptual states, but not propositional\nattitudes, are concept-independent is that perceptual states differ\nfrom propositional attitudes in the type of contents that are\ninvolved (which determines, for example, the particular inferential relations in which they can stand). This explanation is not available if we hold that perception\nand the propositional attitudes have contents of the same type.\n\nIt is open to the \u201cstate\u201d view theorist to attempt to\nexplain the \u201cstate\u201d view distinction in terms of the\nfunctional roles of the different state types. She might argue for the\ndistinction by pointing out that the functional role of belief depends\non an organism\u2019s conceptual capacities and the functional role\nof perception does not depend on its conceptual capacities (since,\narguably, an organism\u2019s perceptual discriminations can outstrip\nits conceptual capacities). However, there is a sense in which this\nwould be a mere restatement of the problem rather than a solution to\nit, since we still need some account of the concept-(in)dependence\nof these functional roles. Again, an appeal to the different\nkinds of contents involved in these different states seems to be a\nstraightforward explanation. The \u201cstate\u201d view theorist\nmight also attempt to explain the \u201cstate\u201d view distinction\nby appeal to the phenomenological differences between the\npropositional attitudes and perception. However, this too seems\nproblematic, since it is unclear why the lack of phenomenology should\nmake a belief concept-dependent or why the phenomenology of perception\nshould make it concept-independent (Berm\u00fadez 2007).\n\nIn a recent article, Toribio (2008) places further pressure on the\nplausibility of the state/content distinction. She argues that\narguments couched in \u201cstate\u201d terms\u2014appealing to the\nconditions the subject must satisfy in order to undergo states with\ncertain representational contents\u2014do entail conclusions about\nthe contents of those states. The entailment is established by noting\nthe first motivation for the conceptual constraint, mentioned above\n(section 2), regarding the proper specification of content. When\nspecifying the representational content of some mental state one has\nto be as faithful as possible to how the creature undergoing that\nstate apprehends the world. Yet, how the creature apprehends the\nworld, she argues, depends on what cognitive capacities it has. Thus,\na creature that lacks conceptual capacities cannot be properly\nattributed states with conceptual contents. Arguments to the effect\nthat perception is state-nonconceptual\u2014that a creature\ncan undergo perceptual states without having the concepts utilized in\nspecifying the content of those states\u2014thus also amount to\narguments that the content of those states are nonconceptual. See Van\nCleve (2012) and Schmidt (2015) for further arguments supporting the\ninterdependence of the state and content views of nonconceptualism. For responses to these arguments against the state/content distinction, see Duhau (2014)\n4. Applying the notion of nonconceptual content\n\nTheorists of nonconceptual content have primarily deployed the notion\nin the service of three different explanatory projects: (a) the\nproject of characterizing the content of perceptual experience, (b)\nthe project of characterizing the content of subpersonal\nrepresentational states, and (c) the project of explaining the\nbehavior of certain non-human animals and of pre-conceptual human\ninfants.\n4.1 Perceptual experience and nonconceptual content\n\nWe can think about the content of perception in conceptual terms. When\nsomeone has a visual experience, for example, it will seem to that\nperson as if something is seen. One way of specifying the way things\nappear to the subject is in terms of the perceptual belief the subject\nwould form on the basis of perception had he taken his perception at\nface value. Such a way of specifying the representational content of\nperception gives us the propositional content of perception. Theorists\nof nonconceptual content have canvassed several types of reasons for\nthinking that this propositional content does not exhaust the\nrepresentational content of perception (see the entry on\n the contents of perception).[6]\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the contents of perception exhibit\ncertain features that cannot be exhibited by the contents of the\npropositional attitudes. In particular, perception is capable of\nrepresenting impossible or contradictory states of affairs, as is the\ncase when viewing certain Escher drawings and when undergoing various\nperceptual illusions. In contrast, it is argued that conceptual\ncontent must be consistent\u2014one cannot have a belief with a\ncontradictory content. Thus, Crane argues that reflecting on the\nwaterfall illusion shows that the contents of perception cannot be\nconceptual (Crane 1988a). Since one cannot undergo a state with\ncontradictory conceptual contents, and yet the waterfall\nillusion is a perceptual state with contradictory content\u2014the\nobject perceived seems to be both moving and not moving\u2014it\ncannot be the case that perception involves conceptual contents (for\nmore on this argument see, e.g., Mellor 1988, Crane 1988b, Crane 1992,\nand Gunther 2001).\n\nSecond, it has been argued that the content of perception is analog in\nnature, unlike the conceptual content of propositional attitudes which\nis more plausibly seen as digital. The distinction between analog and\ndigital representations has (for our purposes) been most perspicuously\nput by Fred Dretske (1981, Ch.6). Let us take a particular\nfact or state of affairs, say the fact or state of affairs that some\nobject s has property F. A representation carries\nthe information that s is F in digital form if and\nonly if it carries no further information about s other than\nthat it is F (and whatever further facts about it are\nentailed by the fact that it is F). But whenever a\nrepresentation carries the information that s is F\nin analog form it always carries additional information about\ns. Nonconceptualists argue that, while propositional\nattitudes represent the world in digital form, perceptual states\nrepresent the world in analog form. Beck (2012) argues that analog\nmagnitude states are nonconceptual because they lack the\nrecombinability necessary for concepts (as articulated, for example,\nin Evans\u2019s Generality\n Constraint).[7]\n\nThird, it has been suggested that the content of perception is\nunit-free (Peacocke 1986). If I perceptually represent an object as\nbeing a certain distance from me, I do not usually represent that\ndistance in terms of a particular unit (in inches, say, as opposed to\ncentimeters), even though what I represent is a perfectly determinate\ndistance. I simply represent it as being that distance, where\nthe content of my perception specifies the distance. Peacocke (1986,\n1989) argues extensively against the possibility of accommodating such\nunit-free representations in purely propositional terms.\n\nFourth, nonconceptualists argue that the content of perception is more\nfine-grained than the content of propositional attitudes. This\nargument can be traced back to Evans, who asks, rhetorically,\n\u201cDo we really understand the proposal that we have as many color\nconcepts as there are shades of color that we can sensibly\ndiscriminate?\u201d (Evans 1982, p. 229). Arguably, I can\nperceptually discriminate many more colors and shapes than I currently\nhave concepts for. Although I may be capable of discriminating between\ntwo color chips of very similar shades of red, red27\nand red29,\nnot being an expert on colors I will not have the concepts\nred27 and red29.\nWith my limited conceptual repertoire,\nI will correctly judge both color chips to be red. However, I will so\njudge on the basis of experiences whose contents are much more\nspecific and fine grained in a way that cannot be captured by my\nconceptual capacities. (The same is true, mutatis mutandis,\nof shape concepts.) My ability to perceive and discriminate the\ndeterminate shades and shapes that I do outstrips my conceptual\ncapacities. As such, my experiences do not seem to depend on my\nconceptual repertoire. Thus, in specifying the content of perception,\nits accuracy conditions, we need not limit ourselves to the concepts\navailable to the subject\u2014hence, perceptual content is\nnonconceptual (e.g., Peacocke 1992, Heck 2000, Tye 1995, 2006.\nDeBellis 1995, and Luntley 2003, argue on similar lines for the\nnonconceptual content of music perception).\n\nOf these, the argument from the fine-grained nature of perception has\ngenerated the most discussion. Opponents of the idea that perceptual\ncontent might be nonconceptual argue that the fineness of grain of\nperceptual experience can in fact be accommodated at the conceptual\nlevel. John McDowell, for example, suggests that the considerations\nEvans raises have force only if we limit the types of concepts\nexpected to figure in the content of perception to such general\nconcepts as red27,\nred29, etc., but, he\nargues, there is no reason to suppose that the conceptual content of\nperception needs to be limited in this way. Rather, the conceptual\ncontent of perceptual experiences is given by demonstrative concepts,\nsuch as that shade (McDowell\n 1994a).[8]\n He claims that our conceptual capacities are capable of\nrepresenting colors with the same fineness of grain with which they\nare perceptually represented. The information loss in the transition\nfrom perception to perceptual belief is not a sign that there are two\ndifferent types of content in play, but should rather be understood as\na transition from a more determinate type of conceptual content (e.g.,\nthat is colored thus) to a less determinate type of\nconceptual content (e.g., that is red).\n\nSeveral objections have been raised against attempts to account for\nthe contents of perception in terms of demonstrative concepts. First,\nfor a capacity operative in perception to count as a genuine\nconceptual capacity it must be possible for that same capacity to be\nemployed in thought. As such, it must be the case that such\ndemonstrative concepts as are arguably involved in the content of\nperception are retained long enough for the possibility of their\nremobilization\u2014they cannot be reserved only for the particular\ninstance in which the sample is perceived. Although the appearance of\nthe demonstrative concept expressible by the phrase \u2018\u2026 is\ncolored thus\u2019 can exploit the presence of the red27\ncolor chip and account for the\nperson\u2019s fine-grained experience of the chip, the demonstrative\nconcept\u2019s applicability cannot be limited to the presence of\nthis sample. As McDowell says, the capacity for employing\ndemonstrative concepts in perception is a recognitional capacity\n(McDowell 1994a p. 57, Brewer 1999 also holds that a conceptual\ncapacity must be available in the absence of the sample to which it\nwas initially applied). Kelly (2001a) calls this constraint \u2018the\nre-identification condition\u2019 on concept possession.\n\nHowever, the objection goes, it is evident that our capacities for\nperceptual discrimination far outstrip our capacities for recognition.\nRegardless of how short the interval between two presentations of a\nspecific shade it is reasonable to suppose that an organism is capable\nof perceiving the shade in all its fineness of grain without being\ncapable of recognizing it as the shade presented earlier. There simply\ndoes not seem to be a dependence between our fine grained perceptual\ncapacities and our memory capacities. But since the recognitional\ndemonstrative concepts the conceptualist appeals to do depend on such\nmemory capacities (according to the re-identification condition), it\ncannot be the case that our having such demonstrative concepts is\nnecessary for our enjoying fine grained perceptual discriminations.\n(For discussion of empirical support for the claim that memory is\ncoarser grained than our capacities for perceptual discrimination, see\nRaffman 1995. See also Kelly 2001a, Peacocke 2001a, 2001b, Tye 2006,\nWright 2003, Dokic and Pacherie 2001 for arguments on similar\ngrounds).\n\nOne response to this objection would be to revise (Brewer 2005) the\nre-identification constraint on the possession of demonstrative\nconcepts, or perhaps retract it altogether (Chuard 2006 explores\nvarious versions of the re-identification condition and argues that\nnone are necessary for the possession of demonstrative concepts).\nKelly (2001a), and Dokic and Pacherie (2001), however, argue that the\nre-identification condition is essential to concept possession.\n\nTwo potential challenges to the appeal to demonstrative concepts have\nbeen highlighted. The first can be termed the priority argument. It\nholds that we cannot take demonstrative concepts as explanatorily\nbasic. The demonstrative concepts I possess are a function of my\ndemonstrative capacities and part of what explains my having a given\ndemonstrative capacity is my having certain associated experiences;\nthe experience must be prior to the possession of the demonstrative\nconcept if the former is to explain the latter (Heck 2000). Various\nformulations of this argument have been developed (see Ayers 2002,\nHopp 2009, Roskies 2008, 2010, and Levine 2010). For example, Levine\n(2010) argues that \u201c[w]hen you see a color and think \u2018that\ncolor\u2019, the seeing is prior to the demonstrating, or else you\nreally don\u2019t know what you\u2019re demonstrating\u2026 But if\nthe seeing, the perceptual experience, is prior to the demonstrating,\nthen the demonstrating can\u2019t be what captures, or brings into\nexistence, the content of that experience\u201d (p. 191). Brewer has\nprovided a response to this kind of objection, following a suggestion\nrejected by Heck (2000), on the grounds that the form of explanation\nthat we should look for is not a causal explanation, which\nwould indeed require the priority of the experience, but a\nconstitutive one. Thus he says that \u201cOn the\nconceptualist view, experience of a colour sample, R, just is a matter\nof entertaining a content in which the demonstrative concept\n\u2018thatR shade\u2019 figures as\na constituent\u201d (Brewer 2005, p. 221, see also Brewer 2002).\n\nA second challenge comes from the so-called argument from\nnon-veridical experience (Heck 2000). Suppose that a subject has a\nnon-veridical experience as of a shade of color that does not exist in\nnature and that has never previous appeared in her experience. Then\nthe subject cannot have an appropriate demonstrative concept, as there\nis nothing to fix the reference of that concept. For a response to\nthis argument see Bengson, Grube, and Korman 2011.\n\nBefore moving to other arguments that have been advanced on behalf of\nnonconceptualism it is worth remarking that the conceptualist appeal\nto demonstrative concepts in response to the fineness of grain\nargument is a response to a challenge to their position, rather than\nan argument for conceptualism. The point of the fineness of grain\nargument is to put pressure on the possibility of a subject possessing\nall the concepts required for a correct specification of the contents\nof perception. If the subject cannot have these concepts and\nyet is capable of undergoing the perception, then it follows that the\ncontent of perception is nonconceptual. However, showing that the\nsubject does have these concepts is not yet an argument for\nthe conceptualist position. For the conceptualist claim to follow,\nthey must show not that the content of perception is in fact\nconceptualizable by the subject undergoing the experience in all of\nits fine grain, as the availability of demonstrative concepts\nsuggests, but rather that the subject cannot undergo the\nexperience without possessing these concepts. Thus even if\nthe conceptualists manage to show that subjects do possess all the\nconcepts involved in the correct specification of the content of\nperception, it still does not show that the content of perception is\nconceptual, it only undercuts the motivation the nonconceptualist can\nobtain from the fineness of grain argument (Coliva 2003,\nBerm\u00fadez 2007).\n\nA fifth argument, related to the priority argument against the appeal\nto demonstrative concepts above, pertains to the possibility of\nconcept acquisition or learning. Presumably what explains our coming\nto possess the observational concepts that we do is our undergoing\nappropriately related perceptual experiences (see, e.g., Peacocke\n1992, 2001a, Ayers 2004). If this is so, it cannot be the case, on\npain of circularity, that undergoing a particular perceptual\nexperience depends on possessing the very concepts the acquisition of\nwhich the experience explain. Roskies (2008) argues that if we reject\nthe claim that perception with nonconceptual content plays an\nessential role in concept acquisition, we cannot account for our\nacquisition of observational concepts without being committed to an\nunacceptable form of nativism. (See also Forman 2006 for a different\nargument purporting to show the necessity of perception with\nnonconceptual content to concept learning.)\n\nA sixth argument for the nonconceptual content of perception derives\nfrom Kelly (2001b). He argues that the central reason perception must\nbe nonconceptual is that the experience of a property depends on the\nsituation in which it is perceived and depends on the object which it\ncharacterizes in a way that demonstrative concepts do not. An example\nof the first sort of dependency is given by the phenomenon of color\nconstancy. In this case we can see two samples of the same color\nproperty illuminated differently (e.g., when looking at a wall that is\npartially exposed to the sun) and experience both to be of the same\ncolor but because of the different illumination we experience them\ndifferently (one is better illuminated than the other). The problem is\nthat since the color is the same regardless of the illumination,\ndemonstrative concepts such as that color cannot be\nsufficient to capture the experiential difference between the\ndifferently illuminated samples; though the experiences differ, the\ncontribution of the demonstrative concept that color to the\ncontent of the experience is the same, given that the property\nperceived, that color in both demonstrations, is the same.\nDemonstrative concepts, Kelly argues, refer to situation independent\nfeatures of the world (e.g., the actual color of the wall) and thus\nare not capable of capturing the situation dependence of perceptual\ncontent. The argument from the situation dependence of perceptual\ncontent has been subject to several criticisms on behalf of the\nconceptualist. One such criticism (Peacocke 2001b) is that, contrary\nto Kelly, it seems reasonable that the difference in experience\ncan be captured by concepts regarding the illumination of the\ndifferent samples (see also Ablondi 2002).\n\nFinally, there is the argument from infant/animal cognition, which\nPeacocke now considers the most important motivation for thinking that\nperception has nonconceptual content (Peacocke 2001a, 2001b, referring\nto Evans 1982, Dretske 1995, Berm\u00fadez 1994, 1998).\nConsiderations of phylogenetic and ontogenetic continuities in nature\nsuggest that animals and infants can have experiences very similar to\nour own. They too perceptually represent the brown tree amidst the\nlush green grass. However, since they lack concepts appropriate for a\ncorrect specification of the contents of their perception, their\nperceptual representation of this state of affairs must be\nnonconceptual. If we share these perceptual capacities with such\nanimals and human infants then it is reasonable to suggest that the\ncontent of our experiences is also, at least in part, nonconceptual\n(see also Schellenberg 2013, 2018). Of course, it may be the case that\nour experience is richer than that of animals and that we are capable\nof many more perceptual discriminations than they are capable of, but\nto the extent that we share our perceptual representations with such\nanimals, the content of our perceptual representations should be\nequally nonconceptual. (See more on this in section\n 4.3)\n\nA crucial aspect of the debate is whether theorists of nonconceptual\ncontent can account for the rational role of perceptual states in\nbelief formation. Although much of the discussion of whether\nperceptual content can be nonconceptual has focused on precisely how\nthe manifest differences between perceptions and beliefs should be\ndescribed (see, e.g., Kelly 2001b, Sedivy 1996, 2006), the important\nissue is whether those differences can be captured at the level of\ncontent in a way that explains how perceptions can justify beliefs.\nMcDowell\u2019s central claim is that there can be appropriate\nrational relations between perceptions and beliefs only if perceptions\nhave conceptual contents, on the grounds that such rational relations\ncan hold only between conceptual states (McDowell 1994a, 2006). This\nis a powerful challenge to defenders of nonconceptual content. It is\nfar from clear, however, that they do not have the resources to meet\nit. This is an issue that has been much discussed in the philosophy of\nperception (most recently in Lerman 2010 and Cahen 2019).\n\nMillar (1991), for example, offers a sophisticated account of how the\nrepresentational content of perceptions can justify beliefs formed on\nthe basis of those perceptions, even though the relevant contents are\nnot conceptually individuated. One obvious strategy for the defender\nof nonconceptual content would be to argue that a nonconceptual\ncontent can stand in logical or evidential relations (such as the\nrelation of being consistent with, or making more probable) to another\nstate even though it is not conceptually articulated (see, e.g., Heck\n2000, Vision 2009). Another possibility would be to follow Peacocke\n(2001a, 2004a, 2004b) who argues that the rational role of a\nnonconceptual way of representing some X is guaranteed when the\nobservational concept X is partially individuated by its\nrelation to such a way of nonconceptually representing X. So, a\nsubject may rationally judge that is a square when taking her\nexperience at face value not only because her perception\ninvolves a nonconceptual way of representing a square but for that\nreason, since such a nonconceptual way of representing squares is\npart of the individuation conditions of the concept square.\nFurthermore, the subject is capable of reflecting on her reasons for\nso judging by asking herself whether the way things (nonconceptually)\nlook to her is reason for her to make the judgment that she does.\nBrewer (2005) argues against such proposals on the grounds that they\ndo not manage to account for the subject\u2019s appreciation of her\nperception as a reason for a given judgment without being\ncommitted to a form of foundationalism with its various difficulties.\nIf, however, perception does involve conceptual content, then\naccording to Brewer, we can account for the subject\u2019s\nappreciation of her perception as a reason for a given judgment\nstraightforwardly, since the subject\u2019s having a perception with\nconceptual content already requires that she grasps the rational\nrelations perception with such a content stands to other states with\nconceptual contents.\n\nAdvocates of the state/content distinction, discussed in section\n 3,\n point out that although arguments for the nonconceptual nature of\nperception are typically aimed at articulating the nature of the\ncontents of perception, that is, whether perception is\ncontent-nonconceptual or content-conceptual, the premises of these\narguments seem to support at most a \u201cstate\u201d conclusion\n(Byrne 2003, 2005, Speaks 2005, Crowther 2006, Heck 2007). For\nexample, the argument from the fine grained nature of experience\ngenerally begins by arguing that one need not have the concepts\ninvolved in the correct specification of the content of perception in\norder to undergo a perception with that content, e.g., one need not\nhave the concept red27 in\norder to have a perception correctly specifiable in terms of such a\nconcept. But though this is merely reason to hold that perception is\nstate-nonconceptual, the conclusion drawn from such an observation is\nthat the content of perception is nonconceptual. (Heck 2007\nalso points this fault in the standard forms of the fineness of grain\nargument and proceeds to develop a form of the argument which he\nthinks avoids this problem and is genuinely directed at the\n\u201ccontent\u201d view.) However, if the distinction between\nconcept-dependent and concept-independent state types ultimately rests\non a distinction between the types of content involved in these\nstates, as suggested in section\n 3,\n then the transition from\nstate-nonconceptualism to content-nonconceptualism (and from\nstate-conceptualism to content-conceptualism) is a legitimate one. We\nwould, then, have good reason to consider the arguments above as\ndirectly relevant to the nonconceptual content of perception\neven though they often proceed via claims about the capacities\nrequired of a creature for having perceptual states.\n4.2 Subpersonal computational states and nonconceptual content\n\nThe dominant paradigm within cognitive science involves postulating\nrepresentational states at the subpersonal or subdoxastic levels (for\nphilosophical discussion see Stich 1978, Davies 1989). Examples are\nthe representational states implicated in tacit knowledge of the rules\nof syntax. It is a fundamental tenet of a broadly Chomskyan approach\nto syntax that speakers are credited with tacit knowledge of a grammar\nfor their language and that this tacit knowledge is deployed in\nunderstanding spoken language. Yet when linguists give theoretical\nspecifications of the syntactic rules contained within the grammar\nthey frequently employ concepts that are not in the conceptual\nrepertoire of the language-user. That is, the language-user is\nascribed knowledge of rules formulated in terms of concepts that he\ndoes not possess. A similar point holds for the representational\nstates postulated in computational theories of vision such as that put\nforward by Marr (1980). The contents of such states are formulated in\nterms of concepts (such as the concept of a zero-crossing) that are\nclearly not possessed by the average perceiver.\n\nWhy should it be thought that the language-user does not possess the\nrelevant concepts? How could he grasp the rule if he did not possess\nthe concepts required to spell it out? The point is not just that\nlanguage-users are not aware of the beliefs in question. Not all\nunconscious mental states are nonconceptual, e.g., my having the\nbelief that the earth revolves around the sun, often unconsciously,\nrequires that I possess the concepts of which its content is composed.\nThe point, rather, is that their representations of the linguistic\nrules are inferentially insulated from the rest of their beliefs and\npropositional attitudes, in a way that is fundamentally incompatible\nwith the holistic nature of conceptual contents. This is also the case\nfor representations at the early stages of visual processing. The\nrepresentations whose function is to register zero-crossings for\nsubsequent perceptual analysis, for example, operate independently of\nthe person\u2019s propositional attitudes, and so their content does\nnot depend on the person\u2019s conceptual repertoire.\n\nRecently such a view of the nature of representational content has\nbeen explored by Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller (2006). They suggest that\nwhat makes the content of a representation nonconceptual is precisely\nthe fact that its content is insulated from other knowledge structures\navailable to the person. Indeed, according to Raftopoulos and\nM\u00fcller, \u201cthe existence of cognitively impenetrable\nmechanisms is a necessary and sufficient condition for nonconceptual\ncontent\u201d (Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller 2006, p. 190). They review\nevidence to the effect that various early stages of visual processing,\ne.g., those responsible for attending to, and tracking, objects in\nspace and time, operate in purely bottom-up fashion. As such, they\nargue, the representations underlying such capacities are produced in\na conceptually unmediated way and hence their content is\nnonconceptual. Thus, they say, \u201c[t]he content of the states of\nzero-crossings is nonconceptual \u2026 because that content is\nretrieved bottom-up from a visual scene. To justify the nonconceptual\ncharacter of the contents of either phenomenal and subdoxastic stages\n[sic] \u2026 it suffices to invoke the fact that these\ncontents are retrieved from visual scenes in conceptually unmediated\nways\u201d (Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller 2006, p. 215).\n\nHowever, though Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller attempt to argue that\ninsulation from the propositional attitudes of the person is a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for any representation to\nhave nonconceptual content, this does not seem to be the case with\nrepresentations in general and certain personal level\nrepresentations in particular. At least with regards to\npersonal level representations, Tye (1995) argues that\none\u2019s conceptual capacities often are involved in determining\nthe content of a perceptual representation, and yet that the content\nof that representation is nonconceptual. This is the case, for\nexample, in the process of perceptually disambiguating an ambiguous\nfigure (e.g., the two faces/vase figure). Though the production of a\ndisambiguated perceptual representation (e.g., experiencing the figure\nas a vase) might involve more than merely information recovered\nbottom-up (e.g., it might employ the concept vase), it does\nnot follow that the resulting perception is conceptual. This is so\nsince for the content of a representation to be nonconceptual it\nmerely needs to be the case that one can undergo a state with\nsuch representational content without possessing the concepts that\nenter into a correct specification of its content, and it seems\nreasonable that one can undergo the same disambiguated experience of\nthe figure without possessing any concepts (and in particular, without\npossessing the concept vase).\n\nA similar suggestion concerning cognitive penetrability and its\npotential impact on the nonconceptual status of the penetrated states\nis explored by Macpherson (2012, 2015). One of her favorite examples\ncomes from Delk & Fillenbaum (1965), who demonstrate that\nfamiliarity with exemplars of a standardly colored category, e.g.,\nfamiliarity with (red) apples or (yellow) bananas, influences the\nperceived color of instances of that category. In a more recent study,\nHansen et al. (2006) obtained the same effect by presenting subjects\nwith a picture of a banana on a uniform grey background and asking\nthem to adjust the color of the fruit until it appears grey. Their\nresults show that \u201c\u2026subjects adjusted the banana to a slightly\nbluish hue--its opponent color--in order for it to appear neutral\ngray. At the point where the banana was actually achromatic, at the\norigin of the color space, it still appeared yellowish.\u201d(p. 1367) In\nthis case, it appears that one\u2019s knowledge of bananas\n\u2018penetrates\u2019 one\u2019s experience of bananas. She calls this form of\ncognitive penetration, cognitive penetration \u2018lite\u2019, where\npossession of some concepts may causally influence the type of\nexperience one undergoes. Yet she argues that in these cases, though\nthe token-experience of the banana\u2019s color is influenced by one\u2019s\nprior knowledge \u2013 one undergoes a deeper yellow type of experience \u2013\nit is an experience-type that one who does not have concepts\npertaining to such colors can nonetheless undergo.\n\nThus, it is consistent with the notion of nonconceptual content that\nthe representation in question is in fact produced in what Raftopoulos\nand M\u00fcller would call a conceptually mediated way,\nwhereby concepts in the subject\u2019s possession influence the\ncontent of a personal level representation, without the content of the\nrepresentation being specifiable in terms of concepts available to the\nsubject. That is, it does not seem to be a necessary\ncondition on the nonconceptual content of representations in general\nthat they be insulated from the propositional attitudes; at least in\nthe case of personal level representations this necessity\ncondition fails. Furthermore, Toribio (2014) argues that even in the\ncase of early vision, the specific target of Raftopoulos and M\u00fcller\n(2006), the claim that cognitive impenetrability is a necessary and\nsufficient condition on the contents of early vision being\nnonconceptual is false. (However, see Raftopoulos 2014a, 2014b, 2017\nfor possible replies.)\n\nStill, it is open to a critic of nonconceptual content to deny that\nascriptions of content at the subpersonal level should be taken\nliterally. John McDowell takes this view (McDowell 1994b), suggesting\nthat subpersonal content is merely \u201cas if\u201d content (an\nargument for the same conclusion is offered in Searle 1990).\nAlternatively, it might be argued (as in Connolly 2010) that the\nsubpersonal information processing actually involves concepts.\nHowever, these lines of argument fly in the face not just of the\npractice of cognitive scientists, but also of some important\nphilosophical analyses of the notion of subpersonal representation\n(Burge 1986, Egan 1992, Berm\u00fadez 1995).\n4.3 Psychological explanation\n\nIn explaining the behavior of nonlinguistic and prelinguistic\ncreatures cognitive ethologists and developmental psychologists often\nappeal to representational states. Spelke, for example, attempts to\nexplain the development of the ability to perceptually organize the\nvisual array into unitary, persisting objects by appeal to an\ninfant\u2019s capacity to form a representation of the visual surface\nlayout and the presence of mechanisms following basic principles of\ncohesion, boundedness, rigidity, and no action at a distance (Spelke\n1990). These capacities are claimed to explain the infant\u2019s\nrudimentary physical reasoning, underlying, for example, its ability\nto track the motion of particular objects and exhibit certain\nexpectancy responses regarding the persistence of objects behind\nocclusions (as exhibited, for example, in Baillargeon\u2019s (1987)\nfamous drawbridge experiment, in which an infant is habituated to see\na screen rotate 180\u00b0, and is dishabituated when the screen\n\u2018passes through\u2019 an object placed behind it. The\ndishabituation reflects the infant\u2019s expectation that the\nscreen\u2019s rotation will be blocked by the occluded object). Such\nresearch suggests that an explanation of the infant\u2019s behavior\nshould appeal to the way the infant is perceptually aware of the\nworld, as segmented into objects that exhibit certain predictable\nregularities.\n\nAccording to Spelke (1988), the content of those representations\nappealed to in explaining the infant\u2019s responses in tasks as\nthose mentioned above is conceptual content. The manifest behavior\nreflects the infant\u2019s incipient object concept and its capacity\nto utilize this concept in a primitive form of physical reasoning.\nHowever, if one has an account of what it is to possess a concept that\nmakes it inappropriate to attribute mastery of the corresponding\nconcept to the creature whose behavior is being explained, then the\nappeal to representations in the explanation of its behavior is also\nmotivation for the notion of nonconceptual representational\ncontent.\n\nOne such understanding stresses the relation between possessing\nconcepts and being able to justify certain canonical judgments\ninvolving that concept, going on to argue that providing\njustifications is a paradigmatically linguistic activity\u2014a\nmatter of identifying and articulating the reasons for a given\nclassification, inference or judgment (McDowell 1994a). If this is the\ncase, then nonlinguistic and prelinguistic creatures will not be able\nto possess concepts and those representations we attribute to them in\nexplaining their behavior will have to be nonconceptual. However,\nthere is a variety of possible responses to this argument. It might be\nobjected, for example, that possessing a given concept simply requires\nbeing able to make de facto justified judgments involving\nthat concept rather than being able to justify judgments involving\nthat concept. Or it might be objected that the ability to justify\njudgments involving some concept is not necessarily linguistic, since\nit is possible to identify the justification for a judgment without\nengaging in communication.\n\nHowever, the argument from the need to provide psychological\nexplanations of the behavior of nonhuman animals and human infants to\nthe existence of nonconceptual content does not stand or fall with the\nthesis that concepts are necessarily linguistic. It has been argued\nthat there is a distinction between two different types of thinking\n(Mithen 1996). Many students of the type of cognition engaged in by\nanimals and infants view it as being domain-specific and modular in\nimportant respects, best understood in terms of bodies of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d closely focused on particular aspects of the\nnatural and social worlds. An example of such domain-specificity is\nfound in the perceptual module Spelke suggests is responsible for the\nsegmentation of the visual array into objects according to certain\nbasic physical principles (Spelke 1990, 1994, Carey and Spelke 1996).\nThese domain-specific modules are thought to have evolved separately\nand for specific purposes and are not integrated with each other\n(Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994). In contrast, many philosophers have\nsuggested that the type of conceptual thought engaged in by\nlanguage-users is essentially domain-general, systematic and\nproductive. Concept-possessors can generate an indefinite number of\nnew thoughts from the concepts they possess and their thoughts obey\nwhat Evans (1982) has termed the generality constraint. As Evans says,\n\u201cWe cannot avoid thinking of a thought about an individual\nobject x, to the effect that it is F, as the\nexercise of two separable capacities; one being the capacity to think\nof x, which could be equally exercised in thoughts about\nx to the effect that it is G or H; and the\nother being a conception of what it is to be F, which could\nbe equally exercised in thoughts about other individuals, to the\neffect that they are F\u201d (Evans 1982, p. 75).\n\nIf the generality constraint is taken to be an essential\ncharacteristic of conceptual thought (as it is by Evans 1982, Peacocke\n1992, and Heck 2007, for example) then it seems to follow that many\n(if not all) non-linguistic creatures are not capable of engaging in\nconceptual thought. For illustration we can look again at\ninfants\u2019 object perception. Though the infant is capable of\nrepresenting its environment in a particular way that explains its\nexpectations regarding object motion and object persistence, the fact\nthat such representations are domain-specific suggests that this\ncharacteristic of conceptual thought is violated. In particular, the\ndomain-specificity of this type of cognition makes it the case that\ncapacities operative in constructing object representations are not\nones that can be engaged generally in contexts falling beyond the\ndomain of operation of the module. Thus, we have a violation of the\ngenerality constraint with respect to these representations. This\nsuggests that the kinds of capacities that are involved in the\ninfant\u2019s representation of the environment are not conceptual.\nSo, if they are correctly described as representing the world at all,\ntheir representations must be nonconceptual. See also the discussion\nof analog magnitude representations in Beck (2012).\n\nOf course, the plausibility of this way of motivating the notion of\nnonconceptual content is a hostage to fortune in two important senses,\none empirical and one philosophical. The argument rests upon an\nempirical claim about the appropriate way to explain the behavior of\nnon-linguistic and pre-linguistic creatures\u2014and in particular\nupon the assumption that it will not turn out to be possible to\nexplain such behavior in non-psychological terms. But the argument\nalso depends upon the thesis that the domain of behavior explicable in\npsychological terms extends further than the domain of concept\npossession\u2014and this in turn depends upon a substantive\nphilosophical account of what it is to possess a concept. If, for\nexample, possessing the concept of an F simply requires being able to\ndiscriminate Fs from the rest of the perceptual environment and/or to\nact on them in a suitable manner, then it is hard to see how any\nevidence that animals and young infants represent the world will not\nalso be evidence that they represent the world conceptually.\n5. Specifying nonconceptual content\n\nWe have so far been talking about nonconceptual content in very\ngeneral terms. If the notion of nonconceptual content is to be useful,\nhowever, we need to have a substantive account of what nonconceptual\ncontent consists in and how it is to be ascribed\u2014an account that\nwill be the equivalent at the nonconceptual level of, for example, the\nFregean account of concepts and concept possession.\n\nTheories of nonconceptual content can be either global\naccounts or local accounts of content. To say that they are\nglobal accounts is just to say that they purport to be accounts of\ncontent tout court, rather than specifications of content\ncircumscribed to a particular representational domain (such as the\nthree domains mentioned in the section above). What is central to\nglobal accounts of nonconceptual content is that they deny that even\nthe paradigmatically conceptual propositional attitudes ever involve\nconceptual contents. As a result, such accounts of content are\nparticularly amenable to proponents of the \u201cstate\u201d view of\nthe nonconceptual debate (discussed above, section\n 3).\n If all content is nonconceptual, the nonconceptual debate can only be\nmeaningfully carried out at the level of state types, not at the level\nof content. Furthermore, since these accounts of nonconceptual content\nare fundamentally non-contrastive, they are of limited use in\nformulating the debate about nonconceptual content. As a\nresult, in what follows we will be more interested in local\naccounts of nonconceptual content. However, before attending to the\nvarious local specifications of nonconceptual content we will briefly\ndiscuss two popular global accounts of nonconceptual\ncontent\u2014possible world semantics and Russellian semantics (as we\nshall see, in discussing Tye\u2019s account of the content of\nperception, these global views can be modified so as to apply only\nlocally).\n\nThe first global account of nonconceptual content, which was already\nmentioned above, is possible world semantics (see, e.g., Stalnaker\n1984, 1998, Lewis 1979, 1986). According to proponents of this view,\nthe content of a mental representation consists of a proposition,\nwhere propositions are taken to be functions from possible worlds to\ntruth values, or alternatively the set of possible worlds in which the\nproposition is true. Beliefs and other propositional attitudes are\nthen attitudes a person might hold towards such sets of possible\nworlds. For example, if one believes that Norman shot Susan, one has\nthe belief attitude towards those possible worlds in which Norman\nactually did shoot Susan. This is merely to say that one takes the\nactual world to be a member of the set of possible worlds in which the\nproposition is true. Similarly, having a perception is having a\nrepresentational state the content of which is the set of possible\nworlds in which the perception is correct.\n\nThe second global account of nonconceptual content is the\nRussellian account. Proponents of this view also hold that\nthe content of a mental representation should be understood as a\nproposition. However, they follow Russell, broadly, in arguing that\npropositions are ordered n-tuples of objects and properties.\nPropositional attitudes are then relations between a person and an\nordered n-tuple that is the proposition that is the content\nof the attitude. For example, to have the belief that Norman shot\nSusan is to stand in the belief relation towards the proposition\n<<Norman, Susan>, being shot by>. (Theories falling under\nthis heading differ greatly; as representatives, see Salmon 1986,\nSoames 1987, Perry 1979, 1980, and other various articles in the\ncollection edited by Salmon and Soames 1988.) Similarly, the contents\nof a perceptual representation are just the objects that are\nrepresented and the properties that appear to characterize them. To\nperceive a blue carpet is to have a representational state the content\nof which is the carpet and the property blueness, that is, <carpet,\nblueness>. (Some Russellians, e.g., Tye 1995, 2000, 2005, hold that\nonly the properties things appear to have constitute the\ncontent of perception.)\n\nBoth possible world semantics and Russellian accounts of content are\nconsidered to be coarse grained accounts of content (in\ncontrast to the Fregean fine grained account of content). For\nexample, it seems to follow from the possible worlds account that a\nthinker who entertains the thought expressed by the sentences\n\u2018bachelors are unmarried men\u2019 and \u2018unmarried men are\nunmarried men\u2019 is related in both cases to the same set of\npossible worlds, and hence is having thoughts with the same content.\nSimilarly regarding the Russellian account of content. A thinker who\nentertains the thought expressed by the sentences \u2018Jocasta is\nbeautiful\u2019 and \u2018Oedipus\u2019 mother is beautiful\u2019\nis related in both cases to the same objects and properties (since\nJocasta just is Oedipus\u2019 mother), and hence is having\nthoughts with the same content. Some have argued that this implication\nand other related ones are detrimental to any coarse-grained account\nof content, in particular when applied to the propositional attitudes.\nWe will not review these arguments here, since they are elaborated\nelsewhere. (For more detailed discussion of these global accounts of\ncontent, see the entries on\n structured propositions,\n  propositional attitude reports, and\n belief.)\n\nTurning now to the local accounts of nonconceptual content,\nwe can expect that a substantive account of nonconceptual content will\nbe tailored to a specific explanatory task\u2014and each of the three\nmotivations discussed in the previous section for introducing the\nnotion will lend itself to a different such account.\n\nThe most developed proposal has come from Christopher Peacocke who has\nproposed a radically externalist conception of nonconceptual content\naimed explicitly at explaining the nonconceptual content of perceptual\nstates (Peacocke 1992). Peacocke suggests that a given perceptual\ncontent should be specified in terms of the ways of filling out the\nspace around the perceiver that are consistent with the\ncontent\u2019s being correct. For each minimally discriminable point\nwithin the perceiver\u2019s perceptual field (where these are\nidentified relative to an origin and axes centered in the\nperceiver\u2019s body) we need to start by specifying whether it is\noccupied by a surface and, if so, what the orientation, solidity, hue,\nbrightness and saturation of that surface are. This specification\ngives us the way the perceiver represents the environment. The content\nof that representation is given by all the ways of filling out the\nspace around the perceiver in which the minimally discriminable points\nhave the appropriate values. The representation is correct just if the\nspace around the perceiver is occupied in one of those ways. Peacocke\ncalls this type of nonconceptual content positioned scenario\ncontent.\n\nHowever, such a specification of the content of perception does not\ncompletely capture the way the world perceptually appears to us. Two\nrepresentations may have the same positioned scenario contents and yet\ndiffer in the way they represent the world to us as being. As an\nexample, upon looking at a 45\u00b0 tilted square one might perceive it\nas a tilted square or as an upright diamond. In both cases of\nperceiving the square as a square and as a diamond\nthe positioned scenario content is the same; that is, in both cases\nthe ways of filling out the space around the observer that are\nconsistent with the correctness of the scenario content are the same.\nHowever, there is still a phenomenal difference between these two ways\nof representing the square.\n\nTo account for this difference in the way in which the same object is\nperceptually represented Peacocke argues that there is an additional\nlayer of nonconceptual content that he calls proto-propositional\ncontent, which involves objects, properties, and relations rather than\nconcepts (Peacocke 1992). This level of content accounts for the way\nin which the square is perceived. When it is perceived as a square one\nperceives a symmetry about the bisectors of the sides, and when it is\nperceived as a diamond one perceives a symmetry about the bisectors of\nits angles. The content is nonconceptual since the observer need not\nhave the concepts of symmetry, or angle, or side, that are mentioned\nin specifying the content of his perception.\n\nThis proposal provides an attractive way of capturing the distinctive\nfeatures of the phenomenology of perception highlighted in the\nprevious section (see\n 4.1\n above). Peacocke\u2019s account of nonconceptual content is analog,\nunit-free and possesses the appropriate fineness of grain.\nNonetheless, as Cahen (2019) has recently argued, such an externalist\naccount of nonconceptual content, though it may capture the\nphenomenology of perception, is in tension with internalist\ncommitments pertaining to the rational role of perception. Another\nsource of difficulty is that it is not so clear how such an account\ncan be applied beyond the domain of perception. It may well be that\ncertain subpersonal states have such nonconceptual\ncontents\u2014those associated with the subpersonal underpinnings of\nvision are obvious candidates. But the representational states\nimplicated in tacit knowledge of syntactic theory, for example, do not\nfit this model.\n\nTye suggests a different notion of robustly nonconceptual content of\nperception (Tye 2005). According to Tye, perception involves\nRussellian nonconceptual content. This is supposedly in conflict with\nPeacocke who, in discussing the experience of perceiving the tilted\nsquare, claims at one point that \u201cWe must, in describing the\nfine-grained phenomenology, make use of the notion of the way\nin which some property or relation is given in the experience\u201d\n(Peacocke 2001a, p. 240). Appealing to a way in which the\nproperty of being a square is perceived is in conflict with\nTye\u2019s coarse-grained account of the content of perception which\nis required for his broader representationalist account of conscious\nperception (see the entry on\n the contents of perception\n (section 7) and the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness).\n Thus, Tye proposes that in perceiving the tilted square, perception\ndoesn\u2019t represent the property of being a square in two possible\nways, but rather that in addition to representing the\nproperty of being square it represents various other properties; which\nadditional properties are represented will determine the way the\nsquare appears. One suggestion is that when the figure is perceived as\na square, the property of being tilted is represented, and when it is\nperceived as a diamond the property of being upright is represented.\nThese are represented properties of the object, not ways in\nwhich the property, being square, is represented.\n\nSome theorists concerned with nonconceptual content at the subpersonal\nlevel have favored a broadly teleological account of what this content\nconsists in (drawing upon the teleological theory of content developed\nin Millikan 1984). This approach can be extended to cover\ncontent-bearing states such as those implicated in linguistic\nunderstanding (see the entry on\n teleological theories of mental content).\n The key notion here is the proper function of, for example, the\nmechanisms underlying a particular stage in visual information\nprocessing (construed normatively in terms of what those mechanisms\nshould do, and usually underwritten by evolutionary\nconsiderations). Proper functions are relational, where this\nmeans that they are defined in relation to features of the\nenvironment. According to teleological theories, content can be\nspecified in terms of relational proper functions. So, for example,\nthe content of a state in early visual processing might be specified\nin terms of the edges in the perceived environment that that stage has\nevolved to identify. Given the particular features that a processing\nmechanism has been \u2018designed\u2019 or \u2018selected\u2019 to\ndetect, it is functioning correctly when it responds appropriately to\nthe presence of those features, and incorrectly when it responds in\ntheir absence (for example, to a sudden contrast in light intensity\nnot due to the presence of an edge). Correctness conditions are fixed\nwith reference to evolutionary design and past performance.\n\nTurning to the third motivation for the notion of nonconceptual\ncontent, one might expect the notion of nonconceptual content involved\nin psychological explanation to be essentially perceptual. Some\nauthors have argued, for example, that the representational states of\nnon-linguistic creatures are essentially perceptual and tied to the\ncreature\u2019s possibilities for action and reaction in the\nimmediate environment (see, for example, Dummett 1993 and Campbell\n1994, although neither of these two authors puts the point in terms of\nnonconceptual content). This thought might be developed in conjunction\nwith an ability-based understanding of nonconceptual content along the\nlines proposed by Adrian Cussins (Cussins 1990). The central feature\nof Cussins\u2019s account of experiential content is that it should\nbe understood not in terms of notions such as truth and\ntruth-conditions, but rather in terms of the organism\u2019s\nabilities to act upon the perceived environment. What the organism\nperceives (the content of its perception) is a distal environment\nstructured in terms of the possibilities it affords for action. This\nconception of an ability-based conception of content yields a sharp\ndistinction between the success-governed level of proto-thoughts and\nthe truth-governed level of full-fledged thought. Proto-thought does\nnot involve experience of an objective world.\n\nOther authors concerned with explaining the behavior of non-linguistic\nand pre-linguistic creatures have proposed applying a richer notion of\nnonconceptual content that is not essentially pragmatic and that can\nbe deployed in a style of explanation analogous to propositional\nattitude explanation. Nonconceptual contents in this richer sense are\nproperly assessable for truth or falsity (rather than simply pragmatic\nsuccess or failure) and can serve as the objects of beliefs and\ndesires (or proto-beliefs and proto-desires). Berm\u00fadez (1998)\noffers an account along these lines developing certain aspects of\nPeacocke\u2019s scenario content. In later work he extended this\napproach to the ascription of thoughts to non-linguistic and\nprelinguistic creatures, developing a model based on a version of\nsuccess semantics and integrating what he termed proto-logical\ninferential capacities (Berm\u00fadez 2003).\n6. The autonomy of nonconceptual content\n\nOne question that arises when thinking about nonconceptual content is\nwhether a thinker can be in states with nonconceptual content despite\nnot possessing any concepts at all. That is, can nonconceptual content\nbe completely autonomous of conceptual content? The possibility of an\naffirmative answer to this question is important for many theorists\nwho wish to employ the notion of nonconceptual content to explain the\nbehavior of nonlinguistic and prelinguistic creatures (depending, of\ncourse, on how demanding their notion of a concept is). Similarly for\nthose theorists who hold both that subpersonal computational states\npossess nonconceptual content and that the relevant modules can exist\nin creatures not capable of any conceptual thought.\n\nHowever, Christopher Peacocke offers an argument against the autonomy\nthesis; concluding that \u201c\u2026 nonconceptual content is not a\nlevel whose nature is completely explicable without reference to\nconceptual contents \u2026 At the most basic level, conceptual and\nnonconceptual content must be elucidated simultaneously\u201d\n(Peacocke 1992, pp. 90\u201391). His argument is based on a\nneo-Kantian understanding of the relation between experience of an\nobjective world and self-consciousness. In essence he suggests that no\ncreature can properly be attributed states with genuine spatial\ncontents unless it grasps the distal environment in a minimally\nobjective way. A condition on grasping the distal environment in this\nway is that the organism is capable of utilizing such states in\nforming and updating an integrated representation of the layout of its\nenvironment and is thus able to reidentify particular locations within\nit. The requirement of concept possession comes in because these\ncapacities essentially involve an ability to represent both the\nspatial configuration of the environment and one\u2019s own changing\nposition within that environment\u2014and, he suggests, this would be\nimpossible for a creature lacking a rudimentary concept of the\nfirst-person.\n\nThis argument is powerful, but can be challenged. Supporters of the\nautonomy thesis, beginning with Berm\u00fadez (1994), have suggested\nthat the interrelated capacities to represent the spatial\nconfiguration of the environment and to represent one\u2019s own\nlocation within the environment need not depend on the possession of a\nprimitive first-person concept. Rather, these capacities can be\nunderstood at the nonconceptual level. In particular, Berm\u00fadez\n(1995, 1998) appeals to the notion of a nonconceptual point of view to\nexplain the interdependence of spatial awareness of the distal\nenvironment and awareness of one\u2019s own location within that\nenvironment at the nonconceptual level. For further discussion of this\ntype of nonconceptual self-consciousness see section\n 7.\n\nPeacocke himself eventually accepted the Autonomy Thesis on the\ngrounds that the capacities mentioned in the conditions for a state to\nhave genuine objective spatial content do not necessitate a conceptual\nnotion of the first-person; indeed, he agrees with Berm\u00fadez\nthat these capacities can be accounted for nonconceptually and without\ninvolving any first-person notion (Peacocke 2002).\n7. Nonconceptual content: Problems and prospects\n\nIt should be clear from the preceding sections that the basic idea of\nnonconceptual content provides a promising tool for tackling a range\nof problems in the philosophy of mind and cognition. Allowing that a\ncreature\u2019s representational capacities can outstrip its\nconceptual capacities makes it possible for philosophers and cognitive\nscientists to study aspects of cognition and behavior that remain\noutside the scope of more traditional approaches\u2014from\nsubpersonal computational mechanisms to the psychological states of\nnon-human animals and human infants to the nature of perceptual\nexperience.\n\nIt should be recognized, however, that there may well not be a unitary\nnotion of nonconceptual content applicable to these various domains.\nWe need to distinguish between the formal notion of nonconceptual\ncontent (the idea of a way of representing the world that is not\nconstrained by conceptual capacities) and the different concrete\nproposals for developing this basic idea (such as Peacocke\u2019s\nnotion of scenario content). There is potential for serious confusion\nif it is assumed that a specific theory of nonconceptual content\nproposed for one area can be unproblematically applied to another\narea. It may well turn out, for example, that fundamentally different\nnotions of nonconceptual content are required for subpersonal\ncomputational states and perceptual experiences.\n\nIndeed, recent work on nonconceptual content has expanded beyond its\norigins in visual perception to other modalities and even beyond\nperception. Thus, Young (2015, forthcoming), drawing on a broad\nempirical literature, argues that olfactive representations, unlike\nconceptual representations, are not concatenatively compositional. As\nsuch they are best understood as representational but nonconceptual.\nOthers, have moved beyond perception and have argued for a\nnonconceptual account of the contents of emotions (see e.g., Gunther\n2003, Tye 2008, D\u00f6ring 2009, Wringe 2015, Tappolet 2016) and\npossibly other affective-evaluative experiences (Mitchell 2018).\nFinally, Beck (2012) has argued that certain cognitive states with\nanalog magnitude content (primitive representations of spatial,\ntemporal, numerical, and other magnitudes) are best understood as\nnonconceptual, as they do not satisfy Evans\u2019 Generality Constraint,\ndiscussed above (but see replies by Gillett 2014, Grey 2014, and\nBeck\u2019s further replies in his 2014).\n\nWhile the philosophy of perception has been the area where the\nconceptual/nonconceptual distinction has been most discussed, the\ntheory of nonconceptual content has been fruitfully employed in other\nareas of philosophy. A case in point is the study of\nself-consciousness (see the entry on\n self-consciousness).\n In 1998 two books independently developed theories of nonconceptual\nself-consciousness (Hurley 1998 and Berm\u00fadez 1998).\nBerm\u00fadez and Hurley both emphasized prelinguistic forms of\nself-consciousness, arguing that linguistic self-reference and\nassociated modes of conceptual self-consciousness both emerge from,\nand need to understood in terms of, much more primitive forms of\nself-specifying information. For Berm\u00fadez these include:\n\ninformation in visual and other exteroceptive perceptual\nmodalities specifying the perceiver\u2019s own spatial and kinematic\nproperties\ninformation via affordances that specify the perceiver\u2019s\ncapacities for acting upon the distal environment\ninformation through somatic proprioception, kinesthesia, and\nactive touch about both the disposition of body parts and the limits\nof the bodily self.\nself-locating information about the subject\u2019s changing location\nin objective space exploited in navigation involving cognitive\nmaps\n\n\nSeveral of these forms of nonconceptual self-consciousness have been\ndiscussed more recently by Kristina Musholt (2013, 2015), who argues\nthat though such forms of awareness provide necessarily\nself-specifying information, they should not properly be considered\nmodes of self-conscious, as they contain no explicitly self-referring\ncomponent. Rather than thinking of the self as being part of the\n(explicit) representational contents of perception and proprioception,\nshe argues it should be thought of as being implicit in the mode of\npresentation (Musholt 2015).\n\nChristopher Peacocke\u2019s recent work on consciousness and\nself-consciousness identifies what he terms a \u201cnonconceptual\nparent\u201d of the first-person concept (Peacocke 2014). What he calls\nDegree 1 of subject involvement \u201cis exhibited by a subject who\nenjoys states with nonconceptual content that is objective, and which\nrepresents the subject as standing in spatial relations to other\nobjects and events in the spatial world\u201d (2014, p. 35). Like\nBerm\u00fadez and Hurley, Peacocke sees Gibson\u2019s analysis of\nvision as illuminating a basic form of nonconceptual\nself-consciousness. Unlike them, however, he does not think that\nnonconceptually self-conscious subjects are necessarily embodied.\n\nPrimitive, nonconceptual, forms of self-consciousness are also\ncritical for the acquisition of the first-person concept and for\ngrounding thoughts whose contents have an important property\nintroduced in Shoemaker (1968). This is the property of being immune\nto error through misidentification relative to the first-person\nconcept, defined so that properties attributed in such thoughts must\nbe properties of the thinker, if they are instantiated at all. Cahen\nand Musholt (2017) argue that it is precisely because certain\nrepresentational states with nonconceptual content, e.g., perception\nand proprioception, do not contain an explicitly self-referring (or\nself-identifying) component, but do supply necessarily self-specifying\ninformation that, while such modes of awareness are not themselves\nimmune to error through misidentification, they can serve as the basis\nfor first-personal judgments that are so immune.\n\nFinally, it should be reiterated that the notion of nonconceptual\ncontent is essentially contrastive\u2014and the significance of the\nnotion depends upon the particular way of understanding concepts with\nwhich it is contrasted. Some psychological states that would count as\nnonconceptual for a theorist with a rich and demanding notion of what\nit is to possess a concept would be conceptual for a theorist with a\nmore relaxed view of concepts. Before we can plausibly claim to have a\nfull understanding of the possibilities of the notion of nonconceptual\ncontent, we need to have a much clearer view than we currently have of\nwhat it is to possess a concept. As we saw earlier, on the most\nminimal view of concepts, a thinker can be credited with a concept of\nFs provided that he can discriminate things that are\nF from things that are not F. A richer view of\nconcepts might demand that the thinker have a full appreciation of the\ngrounds on which one might judge something to be an F. The\nmost demanding view of concepts might require the thinker to be able\nto justify and defend the judgment that something is an F.\nClearly, different locations on this broad spectrum will generate\ndifferent ways of thinking about what is to count as nonconceptual\ncontent\u2014as well as different assessments of the overall\nsignificance of the notion.\n",
