    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Han Feizi: Pragmatic Justification of Practical Policies\n2.9 Han Feizi: Pragmatic Justification of Practical Policies\n\nLike several earlier texts, the Han Feizi puts considerable\nstress on objective criteria for governance. Rulers are to compare\n\u201cnames (ming)\u201d\u2014that is, explicit statements\nof a position\u2019s duties\u2014with results and bestow awards or\ninflict punishments based on how the two correspond. We also read\nthat: \u201cA truly enlightened ruler uses standards (fa) to\nselect men for him; he does not choose them himself\u201d (HFZ ch. 6,\np. 24). While the ruler does not choose ministers according to his own\njudgment or whim, he still must establish standards in the first\nplace; he cannot simply rely on tradition or precedent:\n\n\nThe sage does not try to practice the ways of antiquity or to abide by\na fixed standard, but examines the affairs of the age and takes what\nprecautions are necessary. (HFZ ch. 49, pp. 96\u20137)\n\n\nThis contrasts with strands in several earlier texts which advocated\nconforming with past tradition. In some of these texts, the recorded\nor imagined practices of earlier ages are thought to have\nepistemological significance: evidence of the insights of the sages.\nOthers, more skeptical about naturalistic justifications, imply that\nobserving tradition is our only means of agreeing on a single set of\nstandards, and without such agreement, disorder looms.\n\nMore common than a desire to conform to old practices, though, is the\nnotion that times change and the good ruler must be prepared to change\nwith them. New standards are needed for a new age. This is even\nendorsed by some of the texts which ground ultimate justification on\nthe natural order: the underlying patterns of nature may not change,\nbut their specific applications can, as human society grows and\nchanges. Other justifications of change are more pragmatic, though,\nand the Han Feizi is perhaps the most explicit. Here we read\nthat rulers are enjoined to measure the gains that come from enacting\nnew standards against the losses that ensue; \u201c\u2026 if one\nfinds gain will exceed losses, one goes ahead with them\u201d (HFZ\nch. 47).\n\nThe Han Feizi also gives us a clearer idea than any earlier\ntext of why rule via standard was to be preferred to rule by the wise\nand virtuous. Chapter 40 puts readers through the following dialectic.\nWe begin with the idea, attributed to Shen Dao, that virtue and wisdom\nare unnecessary for good governance; everything depends on\n\u201cpolitical purchase (shi)\u201d and \u201cstatus\n(wei)\u201d. To this a critic responds that \u201ctalent\n(cai)\u201d is also necessary: give power to the unworthy\nand the result will be chaos. The conclusion follows: when rulers are\nso good or bad that nothing could change them, we will call that\nshi-by-nature and set that aside. But such men are rare. The\nauthor is interested in the average ruler, for whom shi is\ncrucial. So in the end we are back to Shen Dao\u2019s position as the\nonly tenable one for the vast majority of rulers\u2014and for all the\nrulers for whom the author\u2019s advice is going to make any\ndifference.\n\nAnother theme of the text is the conflict between individuals and\npublic, state interests. We are shown that even for the virtuous,\nfamily loyalties regularly trump state loyalties, and thus:\n\n\nSince the interests of superior and inferior are as disparate as all\nthis, it is hopeless for the ruler to praise the actions of the\nprivate individual and at the same time try to insure blessing on the\nstate\u2019s altars of the soil and grain. (HFZ ch. 49, p. 107)\n\n\nThe author analyzes this as a conflict between \u201cprivate\n(si)\u201d and \u201cpublic (gong)\u201d\nperspectives, and argues that the two are mutually irreconcilable.\n\nThe ruler, in particular, must heed the distinction between\ngong and si. For instance,\n\n\n\u2026 For his part the ruler must never make selfish (si)\nuse of his wise ministers or able men, so the people are never tempted\nto go beyond their communities to form friendships. (HFZ, ch. 6, p.\n25)\n\n\nThe clear suggestion is that ruler can be blamed if people conspire\nagainst him. In another chapter, we read that\n\n\nTo fail to heed your loyal ministers when you are at fault, insisting\non having your own way, which will in time destroy your good\nreputation and make you a laughing stock of others. (HFZ ch. 10, p.\n49)\n\n\nWhile there are certainly some sections of the text that paint the\nrelationship between rulers and ministers as conflictive\u2014since\nthe latter tend to look only to their personal concerns, at the\nexpense of the state\u2019s more general well-being\u2014this\nchapter, at least, urges a more constructive relationship between\nthem.\n",
