    "main_text": "Demonstration\n6. Demonstration\n\nThe theory of demonstration represents for Avicenna not only an\nessential part of logic but its true culmination. Its central problems\nare the identification of (i) the conditions under which\ncertainty (yaq\u012bn) may be attained in making\nassertions within the context of a scientific discipline and the\nidentification of (ii) the conditions under which completeness,\nrelevance, and accuracy may be achieved in the process of concept\nformation that leads to definitions. This determines in turn the\nnature of the principles assumed in each science for the derivation of\nits own theorems, the way in which boundaries between disciplines\nare drawn, and more generally the overall architecture of scientific\nknowledge.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s original contributions in this area include: (1)\nre-casting the model of the Posterior Analytics in terms of\nthe two fundamental notions of conception and assertion (Strobino 2010\nand 2015b), associating them with (2) a more systematic, and\nultimately simplified, treatment of the four Aristotelian questions\n(if, that, what, why) (Strobino 2015b); (3) a peculiar understanding\nof the notion of necessity in light of Avicenna's own distinction between the\nreferential/substantial and the descriptional reading (Strobino\n2015a); (4) a sophisticated account of per se, linked with the\ntheory of the predicables (Strobino 2016b); (5) an elaborate model for the classification of the\nsciences (Strobino 2017); (6) an innovative classification of that-\nand why-demonstrations (Strobino forthcoming); and (7) a commitment to\nthe applicability of formal logic as a whole to scientific discourse,\nfor instance through the explicit acknowledgment of the fact that the principles\nand conclusions of demonstrative arguments may be both categorical and\nhypothetical propositions, and that categorical as well as\nhypothetical (and repetitive) syllogisms play a role in the\nsciences.\n\nIn this area, Avicenna\u2019s work reflects in complex ways the\ninfluence not only of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b but also of the Greek\ncommentary tradition, especially Themistius and Philoponus, whose\nexegetical work on the Posterior Analytics, now lost in\nArabic, was available to Avicenna. This becomes especially evident\nthrough implicit or explicit references to the commentators\n(mufassir\u016bn) and their commentaries (taf\u0101s\u012br,\n\u0161ur\u016b\u1e25) disseminated in his own Kit\u0101b\nal-Burh\u0101n (Eichner 2010, Strobino 2012, forthcoming).\n6.1. Conception and Assertion\n\nThe distinction between conception\n(ta\u1e63awwur) and assertion (ta\u1e63d\u012bq)\ncomes into play in several crucial ways in Avicenna\u2019s logic of\nscientific discourse.\n\nThe distinctive mark of demonstrative\narguments\u2014certainty\u2014is characterized in terms of assertion. An assertion p is certain if and only if  one holds (i) the\njustified belief that p and (ii) the justified belief that\np cannot be otherwise; a demonstrative argument is one in\nwhich certainty is transferred from premises to conclusion.\nDemonstrative assertions are explicitly identified by Avicenna in the\nframework of a broader classification of various types of assertions\nof decreasing epistemic strength (certain, endoxic, suppositional,\nfallacious), which are in turn associated with a canonical taxonomy of\nlogical disciplines (demonstration, dialectic, rhetoric, sophistic)\n(Gutas 2012; Hasnawi 2013; Black 1990).\n\nFurthermore, Avicenna\u2019s flavor of Aristotelian foundationalism,\ni.e., the view that in every science there are first principles on which everything else depends and which do not depend in\nturn on anything else, is expressed in terms of the need for (i)\nimmediate assertions (ta\u1e63d\u012bq\u0101t) that are not\ngrounded on further assertions and (ii) for the conceptions\n(ta\u1e63awwur\u0101t) of primitive notions.\n\nThe notion of conception is also crucial for Avicenna\u2019s theory\nof per se (\u1e0f\u0101t\u012b), where a basic distinction between types of scientific\npredicates depends on whether they are conceptually inseparable from\ntheir subjects or not (Strobino 2016b).\n6.2 Questions\n\nThe four Aristotelian questions\u2014if, that, what, and\nwhy\u2014discussed in Posterior Analytics B1\u20132 are\nsubject to a more systematic analysis in Avicenna\u2019s\nBurh\u0101n I.5 and IV.1. In Burh\u0101n I.5, in particular, they are rearranged in three pairs with\nseveral internal subdivisions: (i) what (m\u0101), with\nrespect to the meaning of the name or with respect to the essence;\n(ii) why (lim\u0101), with respect to unqualified existence or\nwith respect to existence in a given state; and (iii) if (hal)/that\n(anna), again with respect to unqualified existence or with respect to existence in\na given state. The notion of existence in a state in (ii) and (iii) encapsulates the case of attribute ascription in its causal and factual version, respectively. The three pairs of questions may apply to both subject\nand predicate of a scientific statement.\n\nAvicenna explores various relations and concludes that what- and\nif-questions, in some of their declensions, are more fundamental in\ncharacter, as why-questions ultimately reduce to questions about the\nessence of something, and if-questions express crucial necessary\nconditions for any science, namely the existence of basic entities in\nits domain and the assumption of certain fundamental predicative\nclaims about them.\n\nThe classification of questions is inspired by the idea of reducing them\nto the two basic paths of scientific knowledge: conception and\nassertion and their discursive counterparts, definition and syllogism\n(Strobino 2015b).\n6.3 Necessity\n\nOne of the single most important theoretical revisions of the\nAristotelian model concerns the notion of necessity (\u1e0dar\u016bra), which in fact\ntakes on a new role in Avicenna\u2019s system in a number of\ndifferent ways. At a general level, there is an epistemic notion\nassociated with the idea of certainty mentioned above; then there is a\ntechnical sense involved in Avicenna\u2019s reading of necessity\nstatements (which are unsurprisingly a major ingredient of scientific\ntheories); and finally there is a notion of necessity associated with\nscientific predication, which in a way is the most fundamental of\nall.\n\nTake \u201ctriangle\u201d as a subject of predication and consider\nthe following two sets of attributes: (i) \u201cbeing a\nplane figure enclosed by three straight lines\u201d or simply\n\u201cbeing a plane figure\u201d, and (ii) \u201chaving three\nangles\u201d or \u201chaving the sum of the internal angles equal to\ntwo right angles\u201d. All of these attributes are necessarily true of\n\u201ctriangle\u201d but, according to Avicenna, they are necessarily true of\ntheir subject in two quite different ways. The first two attributes,\n\u201cbeing a plane figure\u201d and \u201cbeing a plane figure\nenclosed by three straight lines\u201d are essential\nattributes of \u201ctriangle\u201d (the former is its genus, the latter is its\ndefinition); they are constitutive of it in a way that\nthe other attributes are not. Furthermore, \u201cbeing a figure\u201d is\nconceptually inseparable from \u201ctriangle\u201d and contained\nin its definition, in the sense that we cannot properly define\n\u201ctriangle\u201d, in its true nature, without appealing to that notion. By contrast\n\u201chaving the sum of the internal angles equal to two right angles\u201d\nis not at all required to define \u201ctriangle\u201d, even if it is necessarily\nimplied by it, and is in fact an attribute that we typically prove to\nhold of its subject. Essential attributes of the first kind are captured\nby definitions, and in general have an explanatory role with respect\nto attributes of the other kind. They explain the fact that attributes\nof the other kind hold of their subjects. In Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof science, these two types of attributes are usually designated by\nthe technical term \u201cper se\u201d.\n\nAvicenna also originally puts his own distinction between the\nreferential/substantial and descriptional reading to use in his theory\nof science. Each of the above two types of necessity (essential and\nnon-essential) can hold on either reading. In particular, the\ndescriptional reading, which Avicenna takes to be the default sense of\nnecessity in scientific discourse, allows us to study the properties\nof a given object qua object of a certain kind (a bronze\ntriangle qua triangle) and to make true, necessary\npredications about it as long as it is a triangle (but not as\nlong as it exists, as a bronze triangle could be re-cast into a\ndifferent shape and lose some of the properties that necessarily hold\nof it qua triangle) (Strobino 2015a).\n6.4 Per se, Inseparability, Containment, and Implication\n\nAvicenna\u2019s elaborate account of per se predication elevates the\nrole of a technical distinction internal to the Aristotelian model and\nassigns it a larger and more systematic theoretical relevance, where\nthree levels of discourse are linked in an original way: (i) the\ntheory of per se itself, (ii) a distinction between types of metaphysical\nnecessity of different strength, captured by the notion of\ncontainment (ta\u1e0dammun) and necessary implication (iltiz\u0101m), and (iii) a distinction between\ntypes of inseparability, which grounds the other two. All three levels\nexpress in different ways the dichotomy between essential and\nnon-essential necessity (Strobino 2016b, forthcoming).\n\n(i) The notion of a per se attribute is ultimately linked with the\nidea that in a scientific theory the admissible terms must be salient\nproperties of the objects under investigation. Avicenna argues that it\nis only through this regimented conceptual vocabulary that the two\ndefining conditions of scientific knowledge (necessity and explanatory\ncharacter) can be met by a theory. In doing so, he provides a\nsystematic account of per se which elaborates on Aristotle\u2019s\ncursory remarks in Posterior Analytics A4 and A22. The Aristotelian\nanalysis of per se is based on the relation of \u201cbeing part of the definition, i.e. of the essence, of something\u201d: a\nterm A is per se 1 with respect to another term B if and only if A is part of the\ndefinition of B while a term A is per se 2 with respect to another term B if and only if B\nis part of the definition of A.\n\nAvicenna connects the definition and classification of the two primary\ntypes of per se relation to the concepts of constituent\n(muqawwim)\u2014the counterpart of per se 1\u2014and\nimplicate (l\u0101zim)\u2014the counterpart of per se\n2\u2014two characteristic notions of his system associated with\ndifferent kinds of metaphysical necessity.\n\n(ii) These different kinds of metaphysical necessity are the\ncounterparts of two types of entailment which Avicenna calls\ncontainment and necessary implication and which express necessary\nconnections of different strength between terms. Containment is the\nrelation between a notion and its intensional parts (i.e., the\nconstituents of its definition, which are ontologically part of its\nessence). Necessary implication is a weaker form of necessity holding\nbetween two notions that are merely inseparable.\n\n(iii) The above pairs (per se 1 and 2, and containment and necessary\nimplication) are associated with a further distinction between two\ntypes of inseparability. The theme is developed by Avicenna especially in connection with the Isagoge, most notably in Mad\u1e2bal I.5, I.6, and I.8. The first type is conceptual inseparability (the\ncounterpart of per se 1 and containment); the second type is\ninseparability in imagination (the counterpart of per se 2 and\nnecessary implication) (Strobino 2016b).\n\nAnother interesting feature of Avicenna\u2019s account of per se is\nthe attempt to develop systematically the Aristotelian criteria and to\nidentify the sets of per se predicates relevant for a given kind or\ndomain of scientific discourse. This has a significant impact on his\ntaxonomy of the interrelations among the sciences.\n6.5 Division of the Sciences\n\nAvicenna\u2019s classification (or division) of the sciences is a\nnatural complement to his treatment of per se as well as being one of the\nmost innovative attempts to develop systematically the material on the subordination of scientific disciplines in Posterior Analytics A7, A9,\nand A13. It is also important for an historical reason.\nAvicenna\u2019s account of the division of the sciences is in fact\nthe only part of his Burh\u0101n that actually had a direct\nimpact on the Western Latin tradition.\n\nThe source of Avicenna\u2019s classification is a chapter from his\nBurh\u0101n famously translated and encapsulated by the\ntwelfth-century Toledan philosopher and translator Dominicus\nGundissalinus (ca. 1110\u20131190) in his De divisione philosophiae. In the first\npart, Avicenna presents a basic classification of the types of\nhierarchical relations holding between various pairs of sciences, based on the corresponding\nrelations holding between their underlying subjects. At the root of the division\nis a distinction between sciences that differ because (a) they have\ntwo distinct subjects or (b) because they treat one and the same\nsubject in different ways. He articulates in full the\nprimary divisions of scientific domains, offering an analysis and\ncategorization of basic types of relations and dependencies (most notably, parthood\nand subordination). In the second part, Avicenna develops a complementary classification\nof the criteria of identity and distinctness for the sciences focusing\non the ways in which sciences may have elements in common. In this context, he addresses\nthe question from a different perspective\u2014that of the canonical\nthree elements of an Aristotelian science\u2014including not only the\nsubjects, but also scientific principles and questions (mas\u0101\u02beil), i.e., the\nconclusions of scientific syllogisms (the theorems of a science).\n\nThe use of three fundamental criteria\u2014subject/genus\n(maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf/\u011fins), principles\n(mab\u0101di\u02be), and per se attributes\n(\u02bfaw\u0101ri\u1e0d \u1e0f\u0101tiyya)\u2014to\ndetermine identity, overlap, or distinctness between domains of\nscientific inquiry is in line with Aristotelian orthodoxy. But\nAvicenna takes the criteria to a whole different level and articulates\na complex network of relations of superordination and subordination\nwhereby scientific knowledge is rigidly organized in hierarchical\nstructures that reflect underlying ontological relations between their\nobjects and attributes. For a detailed account see (Hugonnard-Roche 1988) and (Strobino 2017).\n6.6 Why- and That-Demonstration\n\nAvicenna\u2019s re-interpretation of the distinction between a\ndemonstration that something is the case and a demonstration why\nsomething is the case is related (i) to the classification of per se,\ni.e., to the types of predicates used in demonstrative arguments,\nand (ii) to the division of the sciences (Strobino forthcoming).\n\nAvicenna distinguishes between two main types of demonstration in function of the types of predicates involved (in first-figure\ncategorical syllogisms): (a) those in which the middle term expresses\na per se 2 attribute of the minor, in which case the major may be\neither (aa) a per se 2 attribute of the middle or (ab) a per se 1\nattribute of the middle; and (b) those in which the middle term\nexpresses a per se 1 attribute of the minor, in which case the major is\nin most cases (ba) a per se 2 attribute of the middle, and only in two exceptional cases (bb) a per se 1 attribute of the middle (the reason is that\nusually demonstrations do not aim to prove that per se 1 attributes\nhold of their subjects, these relations being self-evident and captured by\ndefinitions).\n\nWhile proving an assertion, a demonstration may merely provide\nan inferential justification of it or, in addition to that, also the terms that causally explain why things are the way they are. All demonstrations of the\nfirst kind are that-demonstrations; all demonstrations of the second\nkind are why-demonstrations.\n\nWhy-demonstrations may express why (i) a certain attribute holds of a\nsubject or (ii) both why it holds of that subject and why it exists.\nIn this connection, Avicenna aims to draw a distinction between two different kinds of\nexplanation. The fact that the attribute of having the sum of the internal angles\nequal to two right angles holds of isosceles triangles because they\nare triangles is an example of the first kind: the attribute is true of\nsomething in virtue of its being true of a per se 1 attribute (in this case its genus) of that thing. The fact that vines are deciduous because they are wide-leaved\nis an example of the second kind. The distinction is parallel to a\ndistinction proposed for Aristotle between application arguments and\nsubject-attribute demonstrations (McKirahan 1992). Avicenna\u2019s\naccount of per se fits neatly into this scheme, where case (aa)\ncorresponds to why-demonstration of type (ii), and case (ba)\ncorresponds to why-demonstrations of type (i) (Strobino\nforthcoming).\n\nThat-demonstrations are also divided into two types, depending on\nwhether the context is one in which there is (iii) a causal relation\nbetween subject and predicate or (iv) not. Case (iii) is the most\ncommon type of that-demonstration, which typically obtains when the\nmiddle term (in the first figure) is the effect of the existence of\nthe major instead of being its cause (the opposite of type-(ii)\nwhy-demonstration). Case (iv) is a peculiar kind of that-demonstration which Avicenna\nincludes to account for immediate predications where an attribute\ndirectly follows, without mediation, from something\u2019s essence,\nwhich is the only case in which a that-demonstration may be associated\nwith certainty; or for cases where two attributes that are both\neffects of a cause are used to prove one another of a subject\n(Strobino 2016a, forthcoming).\n6.7 Logical Forms of Premises and Conclusions\n\nA point that Avicenna borrows from al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (Strobino\n2017) is the acknowledgment of the fact that the logical forms of scientific\nstatements (whether premises or conclusions) include both categorical\nand hypothetical propositions and that demonstrative arguments may be\nboth categorical and hypothetical (or even repetitive) syllogisms.\nWhat may look like a minor technical point has in fact significant\nimplications for a better understanding of some of Avicenna\u2019s\nmotives in developing his formal logic.\n6.8 Formal Logic and the Logic of Scientific Discourse\n\nAvicenna is open about the fact that the project undertaken in\nthe investigation of formal aspects of logic goes beyond its application in\nthe sciences (Qiy\u0101s\n IV.1).[25]\n\nAt the same time he is also open about the fact that the formal apparatus\ndeveloped in the syllogistic is not exclusively analyzed for the sake\nof studying its properties as a logical system. In fact, on multiple\noccasions Avicenna tells us that the various tools developed for\ninstance in the Qiy\u0101s are used in the sciences, or offers\nremarks on theoretical questions by specifying the default\ninterpretation in the context of scientific reasoning. This is the case (just to mention a few significant examples) in\nthe discussion of reductio ad absurdum and conditionals with\nimpossible antecedents and consequents (Qiy\u0101s\nV.4\u20135); in his account of descriptional necessity as the\ncanonical reading of necessity propositions (Burh\u0101n\nII.1, Qiy\u0101s II.2, Na\u011f\u0101t 123); in\nthe acknowledgment that premises and conclusions of scientific syllogisms may\nbe categorical as well as hypothetical propositions\n(Qiy\u0101s V.1, Burh\u0101n II.6); when he contends\nthat certain hypothetical syllogisms are less used in the sciences\n(Na\u011f\u0101t 82); when he draws connections between the\ntwo areas (Qiy\u0101s VI.5, Burh\u0101n I.7:\ninduction and qiy\u0101s muqassam; Burh\u0101n IV.1:\nif-question and conditional reasoning); or in maintaining the conditional character\nof certain principles in the particular sciences (Burh\u0101n II.7)\n(Strobino 2017).\n\nWhile the formal development of logic undeniably acquires for Avicenna\nan autonomous status that invites its own independent theoretical\nquestions, to see it as an entirely separate enterprise, detached from\napplication in the context of scientific discourse, would betray a\nmisconception of his intentions as well as of his practice.\n7. Fallacies\n\nThe treatment of fallacies addresses one of the complementary\nconditions expressed by the definition of logic, which is supposed to\ndeal not only with what is required in order to infer correctly what\nis unknown from what is known, but also with what is required to avoid\nerror in the case of inferences that appear legitimate without being\nso. There is a parallel in the case of conception and definition:\nlogic provides rules to identify and construct definitions and at the\nsame time instructions on how to avoid common errors in the process.\nAvicenna\u2019s analysis of fallacious reasoning attempts to combine\n(or perhaps force) Aristotle\u2019s treatment from the\nSophistical Refutations into a broader scheme driven by more\nsystematic concerns, which even in the extensive treatment of the\nCure is rather compact. The analysis of error in defining is\nusually covered in connection with the Posterior Analytics and\nthe Topics (for instance at Burh\u0101n IV,\n\u011eadal, IV, Na\u011f\u0101t 149). I will focus\nhere only on the former.\n\nThe Na\u011f\u0101t treatment perfectly captures this complex\nstrategy. It starts with a canonical distinction between fallacies as\n(i) dependent on expression (laf\u1e93) or (ii) dependent on\nmeaning (ma\u02bfn\u0101)\u2014the familiar distinction\nbetween de dictione and extra dictionem\n(language-dependent and language-independent) fallacies\u2014and\npairs it with the claim that fallacies are also either dependent on\n(iii) the form or on (iv) the matter of an argument, an aspect that is\npresent also in the cursory classification given in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t (Street forthcoming).\n\nThe analysis continues with an attempt to \u201cdeduct\u201d the\nfallacies based on the idea that when a false conclusion is reached,\nthen at least one of the characteristic conditions of syllogistic\nreasoning must not have been met. It then proceeds to articulate a\ndetailed account of the different ways in which failure to meet those\nconditions corresponds to different items in Aristotle\u2019s famous\nlist of thirteen fallacies, which Avicenna occasionally groups or divides in\nslightly different ways, especially in the case of those that are dependent\non expression.\n\nThe discussion ends with a recapitulation that yields something very\nclose to Aristotle\u2019s list, even though in a few cases it is hard\nto pinpoint where exactly certain items belong in the systematic\nanalysis.\n\nThe primary reasons of error may be abstracted from a strong\ncharacterization of a syllogism. If a syllogistic argument is (a)\narranged according to one of the figures and its mood is productive,\n(b) it has primary distinct parts (terms) and secondary distinct parts\n(premises), (c) its premises are true, (d) distinct from and (e)\nbetter known than the conclusion, then a true conclusion must follow.\nOtherwise, at least one of conditions (a)\u2013(e) has not been\nmet.\n\nAvicenna unequivocally identifies two of the fallacies that are not\ndependent on expression with (d) and (e), namely petitio\nprincipii (mu\u1e63\u0101dara \u02bfal\u0101\nl-ma\u1e6dl\u016bb al-awwal) and positing what is not a cause as\na cause (a\u1e2b\u1e0f or wa\u1e0d\u02bf m\u0101 laysa\nbi-\u02bfilla \u02bfillatan). The latter is identified with\ncircular proof (bay\u0101n ad-dawr), which is consistent with\nthe doctrine of Qiy\u0101s IX.4 and Burh\u0101n\nII.1.\n\nThe fallacy of consequent (\u012bh\u0101m \u02bfaks\nal-law\u0101zim or \u012bh\u0101m al-\u02bfaks) can be\ntraced back to a subdivision of (c).\n\nThe fallacy of combining many questions (\u011fam\u02bf\nal-mas\u0101\u02beil) is listed in the Na\u011f\u0101t without being discussed and it is altogether absent from the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t. In Safsa\u1e6da I.3,\nhowever, Avicenna seems to treat this case, too, as a subdivision of (c).\n\nTwo other canonical fallacies of type (ii), namely the fallacy of\naccident (m\u0101 bi-l-\u02bfara\u1e0d) and secundum\nquid (s\u016b\u02be i\u02bftib\u0101r al-\u1e25aml or\ni\u0121f\u0101l taw\u0101bi\u02bf al-\u1e25aml) are listed\nat the end of the Na\u011f\u0101t section without being discussed, although\nthey, too, may presumably be classified as subdivisions of (c), namely\nerrors based on taking a premise to be true which merely appears to be\ntrue.\n\nThe case of ignoratio elenchi is more problematic. The last\navailable slot in the Na\u011f\u0101t list is called\n\u201csterility of the connection\u201d (\u02bfaqm\nal-qar\u012bna) and is seemingly not discussed in the preceding\nanalysis. A possibility is to associate it with case (a), namely with\nthe error resulting from failing to recognize an argument as invalid,\nwhich would however distort the original Aristotelian meaning. It may\nbe that Avicenna fails (or refuses) to recognize ignoratio\nelenchi in Aristotle\u2019s sense and perhaps turns into\nsomething like the error resulting from a lack of awareness of the form of\nthe syllogism, which leads to accept an invalid argument as valid.\nThis would be consistent with the I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nvocabulary, which introduces the \u201cignorance of the\ncomposition\u201d (\u01e7ahl at-ta\u02bfl\u012bf) as a\nfallacy while at the same time failing to mention ignoratio\nelenchi.\n\nIn the Na\u011f\u0101t, fallacies dependent on expressions\nseem to be variously associated with cases (a)\u2013(c). Avicenna\ndivides this category into two main sub-cases involving (i) a\nsimple expression (laf\u1e93 mufrad) or (ii) a compound\nexpression (laf\u1e93 murakkab).\n\nIn case (i), error may result from the association of multiple\nmeanings with an expression either in its core form\n(\u011fawhar) or in a derivative form (hay\u02bea).\nThe first case is proper equivocation (i\u0161tir\u0101k\nal-ism) (even though Avicenna uses the term also to refer\ngenerically to other types of language-dependent fallacies) and is in\nfact divided into a number of different sub-types (laf\u1e93\nmu\u0161tarak, mu\u0161akkak, muta\u0161\u0101bih, laf\u1e93\nmanq\u016bl, musta\u02bf\u0101r, ma\u011f\u0101z). The second\ncase is where Avicenna puts the counterpart of the fallacies of accent\nand form of expression (or inflection).\n\nCase (ii) includes the canonical fallacies of composition\n(tark\u012bb al-laf\u1e93) and division\n(taf\u1e63\u012bl al-laf\u1e93).\n\nThe case of amphiboly (judging from the examples) seems to be treated\nas an independent type, associated with (b), but its omission in the\nfinal Na\u011f\u0101t list may suggest that Avicenna, in line with what he does in the\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, possibly regards it as a sub-type of\nequivocation.\n\nThe treatment of fallacies is complemented by a parallel\nclassification of fallacious assertions (propositions that are deemed\nto be true because of a systematic error in their evaluation)\nconsistently discussed throughout Avicenna\u2019s logical works\n(e.g., Burh\u0101n I.4, I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t\nI.6).\nAbbreviations\n\nI use standard abbreviations for quantified categorical propositions:\na-, e-, i-, and o-propositions (universal affirmative, universal\nnegative, particular affirmative, and particular negative).\n\n\nAaB\n \u201cEvery A is B\u201d\n (kull A B)\n\nAeB\n \u201cNo A is B\u201d\n (l\u0101 \u0161ay\u02be min A B)\n\nAiB\n \u201cSome A is B\u201d\n (ba\u02bf\u1e0d A B)\n\nAoB \n\u201cNot every A is B\u201d \n(laysa kull A B)\n\n\nIn the case of modalized categoricals, the modality is prefixed (for\nthe one-sided absolute proposition, I omit the identifier X1\nunless required to avoid ambiguity).\nA full list of abbreviations is given below. For example, Ld1-AaB\nstands for \u201cEvery A is\nnecessarily B as long as it is A\u201d, M1-AiB\nfor \u201cSome A is possibly\nB\u201d, and A-AeB for \u201cNo A is ever\nB\u201d.\n\nIn the case of hypotheticals, I indicate first between parentheses\nquantification and type (conditional or disjunctive), followed by an\nindication of the quality and quantity of the parts (or, when the latter is not required, by simple propositional variables); in some cases the syntactic structure of an embedded categorical is made explicit in the above canonical form. Below are a few examples of expressions frequently used in this entry:\n\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa\n \u201cAlways, if every A is B, then every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ia\n \u201cNever, if some A is B, then every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))oe\n \u201cSometimes, if not every A is B, then no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ee\n \u201cNot always, if no A is B, then no C is\nD\u201d\n\n\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))aa\n \u201cAlways, either every A is B or every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(e-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))ia \n\u201cNever, either some A is B or every C is\nD\u201d\n\n(i-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))oe\n \u201cSometimes, either not every A is B or no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(o-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\))ee \n\u201cNot always, either no A is B or no C is\nD\u201d\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))pq\n \u201cAlways, if p, then q\u201d\n\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))p-AaB\n \u201cAlways, if p, then every A is B\u201d\n\n\nOccasionally, a more fine-grained distinction between types of\nconditionals (luz\u016bm\u012b or ittif\u0101q\u012b) or types of disjunctions (exclusive and\nexhaustive; exclusive but non-exhaustive; inclusive) is required.\nSimilarly, it is sometimes necessary to identify antecedents and\nconsequents of conditionals (for conversion and inferential relations\nwith disjunctions). In such cases the above abbreviations are expanded\nto include the required additional information. For instance to\nexpress the claim that a universal affirmative exclusive and\nexhaustive disjunction implies a universal affirmative\nluz\u016bm\u012b conditional in which antecedent and\nconsequent are contradictories and may be any of the parts of the\ndisjunctive, I will write that\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{D}\\)1)a1a2 implies\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a1o2,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)a2o1,\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o1a2, and\n(a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\)l)o2a1, where superscript\n\u201cl\u201d stands for luz\u016bm\u012b, and the\nsuperscript numbers are used to track the disjuncts where they appear\nas antecedent or consequent of the conditional statements.",
