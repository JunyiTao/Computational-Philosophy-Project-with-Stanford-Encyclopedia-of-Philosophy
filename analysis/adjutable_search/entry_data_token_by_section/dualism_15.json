    "main_text": "Problems for Dualism || The Queerness of the Mental\n5.1 The Queerness of the Mental\n\n\nMental states are characterised by two main properties,\nsubjectivity, otherwise known as privileged access, and intentionality.\nPhysical objects and their properties are sometimes observable and\nsometimes not, but any physical object is equally accessible, in\nprinciple, to anyone. From the right location, we could all see the\ntree in the quad, and, though none of us can observe an electron\ndirectly, everyone is equally capable of detecting it in the same ways\nusing instruments. But the possessor of mental states has a privileged\naccess to them that no-one else can share. That is why there is a\nsceptical \u2018problem of other minds\u2019, but no corresponding\n\u2018problem of my own mind\u2019. This suggests to some\nphilosophers that minds are not ordinary occupants of physical\nspace.\n\n\nPhysical objects are spatio-temporal, and bear spatio-temporal and\ncausal relations to each other. Mental states seem to have causal\npowers, but they also possess the mysterious property of \nintentionality \u2013 being about other things \u2013 including things \nlike Zeus and the square root of minus one, which do not exist. No mere\nphysical thing could be said to be, in a literal sense,\n\u2018about\u2019 something else. The nature of the mental is both\nqueer and elusive. In Ryle\u2019s deliberately abusive phrase, the mind, as\nthe dualist conceives of it, is a \u2018ghost in a machine\u2019.\nGhosts are mysterious and unintelligible: machines are composed of\nidentifiable parts and work on intelligible principles. But this\ncontrast holds only if we stick to a Newtonian and common-sense view of\nthe material. Think instead of energy and force-fields in a space-time\nthat possesses none of the properties that our senses seem to reveal:\non this conception, we seem to be able to attribute to matter nothing\nbeyond an abstruse mathematical structure. Whilst the material world,\nbecause of its mathematicalisation, forms a tighter abstract system\nthan mind, the sensible properties that figure as the objects of mental\nstates constitute the only intelligible content for any concrete\npicture of the world that we can devise. Perhaps the world within the\nexperiencing mind is, once one considers it properly, no \nmore \u2013 or even less \u2013 queer than the world outside it.\n",
