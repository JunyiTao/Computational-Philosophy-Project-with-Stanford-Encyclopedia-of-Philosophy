    "main_text": "Existence and Identity Conditions for Properties || The Sparse and the Abundant Conceptions\n3.2 The Sparse and the Abundant Conceptions\n\nBealer (1982) distinguishes between conception 1 properties,\nor qualities, and conception 2 properties, or\nconcepts (understood as mind-independent). With a different\nand now widespread terminology, Lewis (1983, 1986b) followed suit,\nspeaking of a sparse and an abundant conception of\nproperties. According to the former, there are relatively few\nproperties, namely just those responsible for the objective\nresemblances and causal powers of things; they cut nature at its\njoints, and science is supposed to individuate them a\nposteriori. According to the latter, there are immensely many\nproperties, corresponding to all meaningful predicates we could\npossibly imagine and to all sets of objects, and they can be assumed\na priori. (It should be clear that \u201cfew\u201d and\n\u201cmany\u201d are used in a comparative sense, for the number of\nsparse properties may be very high, possibly infinite). To illustrate,\nthe sparse conception admits properties currently accepted by\nempirical science such as having negative charge or\nhaving spin up and rejects those that are no longer supported\nsuch as having a certain amount of caloric, which featured in\neighteenth century chemistry; in contrast, the abundant conception may\nacknowledge the latter property and all sorts of other properties,\nstrange as they may be, e.g., negatively charged or disliked by\nSocrates, round and square or Goodman\u2019s (1983)\nnotorious grue and bleen. Lewis (1986b: 60) tries to\nfurther characterize the distinction by taking the sparse properties\nto be intrinsic, rather than extrinsic (e.g.,\nbeing 6 feet tall, rather than being taller than\nTom), and natural, where naturalness is something that\nadmits of degrees (for example, he says, masses and charges are\nperfectly natural, colors are less natural and grue and\nbleen are paradigms of unnaturalness). Much work on such\nissues has been done since then (see entries on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties\n and\n natural properties).\n\nDepending on how sparse or abundant properties are, we can have two\nextreme positions and other more moderate views in between.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum, there is the most extreme version of the\nsparse conception, minimalism, which accepts all of these\nprinciples:\n\nthere are only coarse-grained properties,\nthey exist only if instantiated and thus are contingent\nbeings,\nthey are all instantiated by things in space-time (setting aside\nthose instantiated by other properties),\nthey are fundamental and thus their existence must be sanctioned\nby microphysics.\n\n\nThis approach is typically motivated by physicalism and\nepistemological qualms regarding transcendent universals. The\nbest-known contemporary supporter of minimalism is Armstrong (1978a,b,\n1984). Another minimalist is Swoyer (1996).\n\nBy dropping or mitigating some of the above principles, we get less\nminimalist versions of the sparse conception. For example, some have\nurged uninstantiated properties to account for features of measurement\n(Mundy 1987), vectors (Bigelow & Pargetter 1991: 77), or natural\nlaws (Tooley 1987), and some even that there are all the properties\nthat can be possibly exemplified, where the possibility in question is\ncausal or nomic\u00a0(Cocchiarella 2007: ch. 12). In line with\npositions traditionally found in emergentism (see\n \u00a75.1),\n Schaffer (2004) proposes that there are sparse properties as\nfundamental, and in addition, as grounded on them, the properties that\nneed be postulated at all levels of scientific explanations, e.g.,\nchemical, biological and psychological ones. Even Armstrong goes\nbeyond minimalist strictures, when in his later work (1997)\ndistinguishes between \u201cfirst-class properties\u201d\n(universals), identified from a minimalist perspective, and\n\u201csecond-class properties\u201d (supervening on universals). All\nthese positions appear to be primarily concerned with issues in the\nmetaphysics of science (see\n \u00a75)\n and typically display too short a supply of properties to deal with\nmeaning and mental content, and thus with natural language semantics\nand the foundations of mathematics (see\n \u00a76).\n However, minimalists might want to resort to concepts, understood as\nmind-dependent entities, in dealing with such issues (e.g., along the\nlines proposed in Cocchiarella 2007).\n\nMatters of meaning and mental content are instead what typically\nmotivate the views at the opposite end of the spectrum. To begin with,\nmaximalism, i.e., the abundant conception in all its glory\n(Bealer 1982; 1993; Carmichael 2010; Casta\u00f1eda 1976; Jubien\n1989; Lewis 1986b; Orilia 1999; Zalta 1988; Van Inwagen 2004):\nproperties are fine-grained necessary entities that exist even if\nuninstantiated, or even impossible to be instantiated. In its most\nextreme version, maximalism adopts identity conditions that\ndifferentiate properties as much as possible, but more moderate\nversions can be obtained by slightly relaxing such conditions. Views\nof this sort are hardly concerned with physicalist constraints or the\nlike and rather focus on the explanatory advantages of\nhyperintensionality. These may well go beyond the typical motivations\nconsidered above: Nolan (2014) argues that hyperintensionality is\nincreasingly important in metaphysics in dealing with issues such as\ncounter-possible conditionals, explanation, essences, grounding,\ncausation, confirmation and chance.\n\nRather than choosing between the sparse and abundant conceptions, the\nvery promoters of this distinction have opted in different ways for a\ndualism of properties, according to which there are\nproperties of both kinds. Lewis endorses abundant properties as\nreduced to sets of possibilia, and sparse properties either\nviewed as universals, and corresponding to some of the abundant\nproperties (1983), or as themselves sets of possibilia (1986b: 60).\nBealer (1982) proposes a systematic account wherein qualities are the\ncoarse-grained properties that \u201cprovide the world with its\ncausal and phenomenal order\u201d (1982: 183) and concepts are the\nfine-grained properties that can function as meanings and as\nconstituents of mental contents. He admits a stock of simple\nproperties, which are both qualities and concepts (1982: 186),\nwherefrom complex qualities and complex concepts are differently\nconstructed: on the one hand, by thought-building operations,\nwhich give rise to fine-grained qualities; on the other hand, by\ncondition-building operations, which give rise to\ncoarse-grained qualities. Orilia (1999) has followed Bealer\u2019s\nlead in also endorsing both coarse-grained qualities and fine-grained\nconcepts, without however identifying simple concepts and simple\nqualities. In Orilia\u2019s account concepts are never identical to\nqualities, but may correspond to them; in particular, the identity\nstatements of intertheoretic reductions should be taken to express the\nfact that two different concepts correspond to the same quality.\nDespite its advantages in dealing with a disparate range of phenomena,\ndualism has not gained any explicit consensus. Its implicit presence\nmay however be widespread. For example, Putnam\u2019s (1970: \u00a71)\ndistinction between predicates and physical\nproperties, and Armstrong\u2019s above-mentioned recognition of\nsecond-class properties may be seen as forms of dualism.\n",
