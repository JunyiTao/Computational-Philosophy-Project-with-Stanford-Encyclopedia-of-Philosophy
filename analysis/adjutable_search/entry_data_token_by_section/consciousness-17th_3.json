    "main_text": "Spinoza\n3. Spinoza\n\nWhile many philosophers after Descartes took up the issues related to\nconsciousness left by Descartes, one possible exception is Spinoza. On\nsome interpretations, he doesn\u2019t have much to say at all about\n consciousness.[7]\n This is somewhat striking, given how much Spinoza had to say about\nideas and the mind. However, this may be a reflection of just how thin\nSpinoza\u2019s attribute of thought really is, bringing together what\nin Descartes were distinct concepts: will and intellect, judgment and\nperception, and the like, developing a fully naturalized account of\nthe mind. And so it seems that, insofar as Spinoza has a theory of\nconsciousness, it will be explained in terms of some other more\nfundamental feature of the mind.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s theory of mind is a thoroughly\nrepresentational theory of mind. The mental consists simply\nin representational content, for Spinoza. In Ethics 2p7, he\nargues that \u201cthe order and connection of ideas is the same as\nthe order and connection of\n things,\u201d[8]\n which is to say that for each extended object, there is a parallel\nidea. This is called mind-body parallelism. From this Spinoza is able\nto develop his theory of mind: \u201cThe first thing that constitutes\nthe actual being of a human mind is nothing but the idea of a singular\nthing which actually exists\u201d (2p11). Each mind is itself an idea\nwith a particular object\u2014in the case of humans, the mind is the\nidea of its body, and whatever happens in the body will be represented\nin the mind (as he argues in 2p12 and 2p13). The mind is a particular\nidea that represents a singular object, namely, the body that it is\nparallel to. This is a fully representational theory of mind, and\nanything else that can be inferred from the mind will have its\nparallel in the body that it represents. (For more on Spinoza\u2019s\nrepresentational theory of mind, see Della Rocca 1996.)\n\nSo, of the three main threads discussed above, it seems that the\nintentionality of thought is the primary pivot on which everything\nelse turns for Spinoza\u2019s theory of mind. There are suggestions\nin Spinoza\u2019s Ethics that he thinks there are some\nrepresentations of which we are unaware. At the end of the\nEthics, Spinoza describes the \u201cwise man\u201d as the\none who is \u201cconscious of himself, and of God, and of\nthings\u201d (5p42s), the clear implication being that those who\naren\u2019t wise fail to be conscious of themselves, God, or\nthings, even if these things are present to mind through a mental\nrepresentation. And so, it seems that Spinoza needs an account of\nconsciousness that does not extend to every mental representation (or,\nat the very least, not to the same degree).\n",
