    "main_text": "Evolutionary Models\n7. Evolutionary Models\n\nThus far we have examined accounts of social norms that take for\ngranted that a particular norm exists in a population. However, for a\nfull account of social norms, we must answer two questions related to\nthe dynamics of norms. First, we must ask how a norm can emerge. Norms\nrequire a set of corresponding beliefs and expectations to support\nthem, and so there must be an account of how these arise. Second, we\nmust investigate the conditions under which a norm is stable under\nsome competitive pressure from other norms. Sometimes, multiple\ncandidate norms vie for dominance in a population. Even if one norm\nhas come to dominate the population, new norms can try to\n\u201cinvade\u201d the existing norm\u2019s population of\nadherents.\n\nLet us now turn to the question of norm emergence. Here we can see\nthree classes of models: first, a purely biological approach, second,\na more cognitive approach, and third, a structured interactions\napproach. The most famous of the biological approaches to norms seek\nto explain cooperative behavior. The simplest models are kin selection\nmodels (Hamilton 1964). These models seek to explain altruistic\ntendencies in animals by claiming that, as selection acts on genes,\nthose genes have an incentive to promote the reproductive success of\nother identical sets of genes found in other animals. This mode of\nexplanation can provide an account of why we see cooperative behaviors\nwithin families, but being gene-centered, cannot explain cooperative\nbehavior toward strangers (as strangers should not be sufficiently\ngenetically related to merit altruistic behavior).\n\nModels of \u201creciprocal altruism\u201d (Trivers 1971, 1985), on\nthe other hand, tell us that cooperative behavior has no chance of\nevolving in random pairings, but will evolve in a social framework in\nwhich individuals can benefit from building reputations for being nice\nguys. Reciprocal altruism, however, does not require an evolutionary\nargument; a simple model of learning in ongoing close-knit groups will\ndo, and has the further advantage of explaining why certain types of\ncooperative behavior are more likely to emerge than others. All that\nmatters in these models is that agents can properly identify other\nagents, such that they can maintain a record of their past behavior.\nThis allows for the possibility of reputations: people who have the\nreputation of being cooperative will be treated cooperatively, and\nthose who have a reputation of being unfair will be treated\nunfairly.\n\nA variation on the idea of reciprocal altruism can be seen in Axelrod\n(1986). Axelrod presents a \u201cnorms game\u201d in which agents\nprobabilistically choose to comply with the norm, or deviate from it,\nand then other agents can probabilistically choose to punish any\ndeviations at some cost to them. Agents can choose over time to be\nmore or less \u201cbold\u201d, which determines the rate at which\nthey attempt defections, and they can likewise choose to be more or\nless \u201cvengeful\u201d, which determines how often they punish.\nAxelrod noted that if the game is left like this, we find that the\nstable state is constant defection and no punishment. However, if we\nintroduce a meta-norm\u2014one that punishes people who fail to\npunish defectors\u2014then we arrive at a stable norm in which there\nis no boldness, but very high levels of vengefulness. It is under\nthese conditions that we find a norm emerge and remain stable.\nAxelrod\u2019s model aims to illustrate that norms require\nmeta-norms. That is, failure to retaliate against a defection must be\nseen as equivalent to a defection itself. What Axelrod does not\nanalyze is whether there is some cost to being vigilant. Namely,\nwatching both defectors and non-punishers may have a cost that, though\nnominal, might encourage some to abandon vigilance once there has been\nno punishment for some time.\n\nBicchieri, Duffy and Tolle (2004) present an alternative model of norm\nemergence to explain how a norm of impersonal trust/reciprocity can\nemerge and survive in a heterogeneous population. This model does not\nrely on a meta-norm of punishment; instead, it is purely driven by\nrepeated interactions of conditional strategies. In their model,\nagents play anywhere from 1 to 30 rounds of a trust game for 1,000\niterations, relying on the 4 unconditional strategies, and the 16\nconditional strategies that are standard for the trust game. After\neach round, agents update their strategies based on the replicator\ndynamic. As the number of rounds grows, a norm of impersonal\ntrust/reciprocity emerges in the population. Most interestingly,\nhowever, the norm is not associated with a single strategy, but it is\nsupported by several strategies behaving in similar ways. This model\nsuggests that Trivers\u2019 basic model works well in normal social\ncontexts, but we can further enrich the story by allowing a social\nnorm to supervene on several behavioral strategies.\n\nMuldoon et al. (2012) explore a simpler approach to norm emergence that\nrelies on individual reasoners weighing their individual interests\nagainst their social sensitivity. This is done across a number of\nmodel variants based on a simple standing ovation. A striking finding\nof their \u201csymmetric\u201d model is that norm emergence is\nfairly rare, but can also be distinguished from merely common\nbehaviors. A more cognitively demanding approach was taken by Muldoon,\nLisciandra and Hartmann (2012), in which bayesian reasoners can learn\nto \u201cdiscover\u201d norms that were not present, and have no\nparticular value. This can happen when agents think there might be a\nsocial rule, and then over-interpret social evidence. These models\ncombine to suggest that we should expect many arbitrary norms, rather\nthan a functionalist argument for the presence of norms.\n\nThe third prominent model of norm emergence comes from Brian Skyrms\n(1996, 2004) and Jason Alexander (2007). In this approach, two\ndifferent features are emphasized: relatively simple cognitive\nprocesses and structured interactions. Both have explored a variety of\ngames (such as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, the stag hunt, divide the\ndollar, and the ultimatum game) as exemplars of situations that offer\nthe possibility of the emergence of a moral norm. Though Skyrms\noccasionally uses the replicator dynamic, both tend to emphasize\nsimpler mechanisms in an agent-based learning context. In particular,\nlearning rules like \u201cimitate the best\u201d or best response\nare used, as they are much less cognitively demanding. Alexander\njustifies the use of these simpler rules on the grounds that, rather\nthan fully rational agents, we are cognitively limited beings who rely\non fairly simple heuristics for our decision-making. Rules like\nimitation are extremely simple to follow. Best response requires a bit\nmore cognitive sophistication, but is still simpler than a fully\nBayesian model with unlimited memory and computational power. These\nsimpler learning rules provide the same function as the replicator\ndynamic: in between rounds of play, agents rely on their learning rule\nto decide what strategy to employ. Note that both Skyrms and Alexander\ntend to treat norms as single strategies.\n\nThe largest contribution of this strain of modeling comes not from the\nassumption of boundedly rational agents, but rather the careful\ninvestigation of the effects of particular social structures on the\nequilibrium outcomes of various games. Much of the previous literature\non evolutionary games has focused on the assumptions of infinite\npopulations of agents playing games against randomly-assigned\npartners. Skyrms and Alexander both rightly emphasize the importance\nof structured interaction. As it is difficult to uncover and represent\nreal-world network structures, both tend to rely on examining\ndifferent classes of networks that have different properties, and from\nthere investigate the robustness of particular norms against these\nalternative network structures. Alexander (2007) in particular has\ndone a very careful study of the different classical network\nstructures, where he examines lattices, small world networks, bounded\ndegree networks, and dynamic networks for each game and learning rule\nhe considers. A final feature of Skyrms and Alexander\u2019s work is\na refinement on this structural approach: they separate out two\ndifferent kinds of networks. First, there is the interaction\nnetwork, which represents the set of agents that any given agent\ncan actively play a game with. Second is the update network,\nwhich is the set of agents that an agent can \u201csee\u201d when\napplying her learning rule. The interaction network is thus\none\u2019s immediate community, whereas the update network is all\nthat the agent can see. To see why this is useful, we can imagine a\ncase not too different from how we live, in which there is a fairly\nlimited set of other people we may interact with, but thanks to a\nplethora of media options, we can see much more widely how others\nmight act. This kind of situation can only be represented by clearly\nseparating the two networks.\n\nThus, what makes the theory of norm emergence of Skyrms and Alexander\nso interesting is its enriching the set of idealizations that one must\nmake in building a model. The addition of structured interaction and\nstructured updates to a model of norm emergence can help make clear\nhow certain kinds of norms tend to emerge in certain kinds of\nsituation and not others, which is difficult or impossible to capture\nin random interaction models.\n\nNow that we have examined norm emergence, we must examine what happens\nwhen a population is exposed to more than one social norm. In this\ninstance, social norms must compete with each other for adherents.\nThis lends itself to investigations about the competitive dynamics of\nnorms over long time horizons. In particular, we can investigate the\nfeatures of norms and of their environments, such as the populations\nthemselves, which help facilitate one norm becoming dominant over\nothers, or becoming prone to elimination by its competitors. An\nevolutionary model provides a description of the conditions under\nwhich social norms may spread. One may think of several environments\nto start with. A population can be represented as entirely\nhomogeneous, in the sense that everybody is adopting the same type of\nbehavior, or heterogeneous to various degrees. In the former case, it\nis important to know whether the commonly adopted behavior is stable\nagainst mutations. The relevant concept here is that of an\nevolutionarily stable strategy (ESS; Maynard Smith &\nPrice 1973; Taylor & Jonker 1978): when a population of\nindividuals adopts such a strategy, it cannot be successfully invaded\nby isolated mutants, since the mutants will be at a disadvantage with\nrespect to reproductive success. An evolutionarily stable strategy is\na refinement of the Nash equilibrium in game theory. Unlike standard\nNash equilibria, evolutionarily stable strategies must either be\nstrict equilibria, or have an advantage when playing against\nmutant strategies. Since strict equilibria are always superior to any\nunilateral deviations, and the second condition requires that the ESS\nhave an advantage in playing against mutants, the strategy will remain\nresistant to any mutant invasion. This is a difficult criterion to\nmeet, however. For example, a classic Tit-For-Tat strategy in the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma is not an ESS. Many strategies perform\nequally well against it, including the very simple \u201cAlways\nCooperate\u201d strategy, let alone Tit-For-Two-Tats, and any number\nof variations. Tit-For-Tat is merely an evolutionarily neutral\nstrategy relative to these others. If we only consider strategies that\nare defection-oriented, then Tit-For-Tat is an ESS, since it will do\nbetter against itself, and no worse than defection strategies when\npaired with them.\n\nA more interesting case, and one relevant to a study of the\nreproduction of norms of cooperation, is that of a population in which\nseveral competing strategies are present at any given time. What we\nwant to know is whether the strategy frequencies that exist at a time\nare stable, or if there is a tendency for one strategy to become\ndominant over time. If we continue to rely on the ESS solution\nconcept, we see a classic example in the hawk-dove game. If we assume\nthat there is no uncorrelated asymmetry between the players, then the\nmixed Nash equilibrium is the ESS. If we further assume that there is\nno structure to how agents interact with each other, this can be\ninterpreted in two ways: either each player randomizes her strategy in\neach round of play, or we have a stable polymorphism in the\npopulation, in which the proportion of each strategy in the population\ncorresponds to the frequency with which each strategy would be played\nin a randomizing approach. So, in those cases where we can assume that\nplayers randomly encounter each other, whenever there is a mixed\nsolution ESS we can expect to find polymorphic populations.\n\nIf we wish to avoid the interpretive challenge of a mixed solution\nESS, there is an alternative analytic solution concept that we can\nemploy: the evolutionarily stable state. An evolutionarily stable\nstate is a distribution of (one or more) strategies that is robust\nagainst perturbations, whether they are exogenous shocks or mutant\ninvasions, provided the perturbations are not overly large.\nEvolutionarily stable states are solutions to a replicator dynamic.\nSince evolutionarily stable states are naturally able to describe\npolymorphic or monomorphic populations, there is no difficulty with\nintroducing population-oriented interpretations of mixed strategies.\nThis is particularly important when random matching does not occur, as\nunder those conditions, the mixed strategy can no longer be thought of\nas a description of population polymorphism.\n\nNow that we have seen the prominent approaches to both norm emergence\nand norm stability, we can turn to some general interpretive\nconsiderations of evolutionary models. An evolutionary approach is\nbased on the principle that strategies with higher current payoffs\nwill be retained, while strategies that lead to failure will be\nabandoned. The success of a strategy is measured by its relative\nfrequency in the population at any given time. This is most easily\nseen in a game theoretic framework. A game is repeated a finite number\nof times with randomly selected opponents. After each round of the\ngame, the actual payoffs and strategies of the players become public\nknowledge; on the basis of this information, each player adjusts her\nstrategy for the next round. The payoff to an individual player\ndepends on her choice as well as on the choices of the other players\nin the game, and players are rational in the sense that they are\npayoff-maximizers. In an evolutionary model, however, players learn\nand adapt in a non-Bayesian way, that is, they do not condition on\npast experience using Bayes\u2019 Rule. In this sense, they are not\ntypical rational learners (Nachbar 1990; Binmore & Samuelson\n1992).\n\nIn an evolutionary approach behavior is adaptive, so that a strategy\nthat did work well in the past is retained, and one that fared poorly\nwill be changed. This can be interpreted in two ways: either the\nevolution of strategies is the consequence of adaptation by individual\nagents, or the evolution of strategies is understood as the\ndifferential reproduction of agents based on their success rates in\ntheir interactions. The former interpretation assumes short timescales\nfor interactions: many iterations of the game over time thus represent\nno more than a few decades in time in total. The latter interpretation\nassumes rather longer timescales: each instance of strategy adjustment\nrepresents a new generation of agents coming into the population, with\nthe old generation dying simultaneously. Let us consider the\nramifications of each interpretation in turn.\n\nIn the first interpretation, we have agents who employ learning rules\nthat are less than fully rational, as defined by what a Bayesian agent\nwould have, both in terms of computational ability and memory. As\nsuch, these rules tend to be classified as adaptive strategies: they\nare reacting to a more limited set of data, with lower cognitive\nresources than what a fully rational learner would possess. However,\nthere are many different adaptive mechanisms we may attribute to the\nplayers. One realistic adaptive mechanism is learning by trial and\nerror; another plausible mechanism is imitation: those who do best are\nobserved by others who subsequently emulate their behavior (Hardin\n1982). Reinforcement learning is another class of adaptive behavior,\nin which agents tweak their probabilities of choosing one strategy\nover another based on the payoffs they just received.\n\nIn the second interpretation, agents themselves do not learn, but\nrather the strategies grow or shrink in the population according to\nthe reproductive advantages that they bestow upon the agents that\nadhere to them. This interpretation requires very long timescales, as\nit requires many generations of agents before equilibrium is reached.\nThe typical dynamics that are considered in such circumstances come\nfrom biology. A standard approach is something like the replicator\ndynamic. Norms grow or shrink in proportion to both how many agents\nadhere to them at a given time, and their relative payoffs. More\nsuccessful strategies gain adherents at the expense of less-successful\nones. This evolutionary process assumes a constant-sized (or infinite)\npopulation over time. This interpretation of an evolutionary dynamic,\nwhich requires long timescales, raises the question of whether norms\nthemselves evolve slowly. Norms can rapidly collapse in a very short\namount of time. This phenomenon could not be represented within a\nmodel whose interpretation is generational in nature. It remains an\nopen question, however, as to whether such timescales can be\nappropriate for examining the emergence of certain kinds of norms.\nWhile it is known that many norms can quickly come into being, it is\nnot clear if this is true of all norms.\n\nAnother challenge in using evolutionary models to study social norms\nis that there is a potential problem of representation. In\nevolutionary models, there is no rigorous way to represent innovation\nor novelty. Whether we look at an agent-based simulation approach, or\na straightforward game-theoretic approach, the strategy set open to\nthe players, as well as their payoffs, must be defined in advance. But\nmany social norms rely on innovations, whether they are technological\nor social. Wearing mini-skirts was not an option until they were\ninvented. Marxist attitudes were largely not possible until Marx. The\nage at which one gets married and how many children one has are highly\nlinked to availability of and education about birth control\ntechnologies. While much of the study of norms has focused on more\ngeneric concepts such as fairness, trust, or cooperation, the full\nbreadth of social norms covers many of these more specific norms that\nrequire some account of social innovation.\n\nThis representational challenge has broad implications. Even when we\ncan analytically identify evolutionarily stable states in a particular\ngame, which is suggestive of norms that will be converged upon, we now\nhave a problem of claiming that this norm has prospects for long-term\nstability. Events like the publication of the Kinsey report can\ndramatically shift seemingly stable norms quite rapidly. As the\nunderlying game changes in the representation, our previous results no\nlonger apply. In the face of this representational problem, we can\neither attempt to develop some metric of the robustness of a given\nnorm in the space of similar games, or more carefully scope the claims\nthat we can make about the social norms that we study with this\nmethodology.\n\nAlthough some questions of interpretation and challenges of\nrepresentation exist, an important advantage of the evolutionary\napproach is that it does not require sophisticated strategic reasoning\nin circumstances, such as large-group interactions, in which it would\nbe unrealistic to assume it. People are very unlikely to engage in\nfull Bayesian calculations in making decisions about norm adherence.\nAgents often rely on cognitive shortcuts to determine when norms ought\nto be in effect given a certain context, and whether or not they\nshould adhere to them. Evolutionary models that employ adaptive\nlearning strategies capture these kinds of cognitive constraints, and\nallow the theorist to explore how these constraints influence the\nemergence and stability of norms.\n",
