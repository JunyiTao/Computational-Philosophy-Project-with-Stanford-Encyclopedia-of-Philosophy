    "main_text": "Conceptions of Narrow Content || Descriptive Content\n4.1 Descriptive Content\n\nPerhaps the most obvious suggestion is that the narrow content of a\nparticular belief can be understood as a more detailed description of\nwhat is believed. More specifically, the idea is that the narrow\ncontent of a particular concept is a description of what the concept\nexpresses or refers to.\n\nAn example will make this idea clearer. Consider Oscar, who believes\nthat water is wet. This belief involves the concept of water, and\narguments like Putnam\u2019s appear to show that the ordinary content\nof this concept is broad. The proposal we are considering is that\nthere is a more detailed description that captures the narrow content,\nfor Oscar, of the concept of water. This description might be\nsomething like \u201cclear, colorless, odorless liquid that falls\nfrom the sky and fills the lakes.\u201d Oscar and his Twin may share\nthis descriptive content even though their\n\u2018water\u2019-concepts do not have the same broad content. The\nsuggestion, then, is that, when Oscar thinks the thought that he would\nexpress by saying \u201cwater is wet,\u201d and when Twin Oscar\nthinks the thought that he would express by saying, in Twin English,\n\u201cwater is wet,\u201d both of them are expressing a thought with\nthe descriptive content \u201cthe clear, colorless, odorless liquid\nthat falls from the sky and fills the lakes is wet.\u201d This narrow\ncontent, the proposal continues, determines, on Twin Earth, the broad\ncontent that XYZ is wet, while on Earth it determines the broad\ncontent that water (i.e. H2O) is wet.\n\nNotice that if this description is to succeed in determining the\nappropriate broad content on Earth and on Twin Earth, then it must\nhave a subtle \u201cindexical\u201d component. An indexical is a\nterm, like \u2018I\u2019 or \u2018now\u2019, whose referent is\ncontext-relative. The referent of \u2018I\u2019 depends on who\nutters or thinks it; the referent of \u2018now\u2019 depends on the\ntime at which it is uttered or thought. The supposedly narrow content\n\u201ccolorless odorless liquid that falls from the sky and fills the\nlakes\u201d must have an implicit indexical component: the content in\nquestion is really something like \u201cthe colorless, odorless\nliquid that falls from the sky and fills the lakes around\nhere\u201d (Putnam 1975, p. 234).\n\nThere is an obvious and serious problem with the proposal that narrow\ncontent is descriptive content, however. The problem is simply that\nthe description which is intended to give the narrow content of a\nconcept such as Oscar\u2019s \u2018water\u2019-concept may itself\nbe broad (Lepore and Loewer, 1986; Taylor, 1989). In my example,\nseveral of the concepts involved in the descriptive content arguably\nhave broad contents. The notion of a liquid has a technical meaning\nthat need not correspond to the observable properties we associate\nwith it. And perhaps concepts like those of sky, lake, and color are\nalso broad.\n\nThis objection need not be entirely crushing, but it certainly makes\nthe descriptive content approach more difficult to spell out in\ndetail. If we specify the description that is supposed to capture a\nnarrow content in ordinary language, then we will need to use only\nordinary-language terms that do not have broad contents. If the moral\nof the arguments for broad content is as sweeping as philosophers like\nBurge believe, it may be difficult or impossible to find enough\nordinary-language expressions that satisfy this requirement. We could\nregard the description we have been discussing as a first step; the\nsecond step would be to replace the expressions \u2018liquid\u2019,\n\u2018sky\u2019, \u2018lake\u2019, and so on with their own\ndescriptive contents. But these descriptions in turn might well\ncontain expressions with broad contents, which would then need to be\nreplaced with still further descriptions. It is not clear that we will\nbe able to find enough purely narrow expressions to do all the\ndescriptive work we need. (Mendola 2008 is a recent attempt to develop\na detailed version of the descriptive approach that can overcome such\nworries.)\n",
