    "main_text": "Firms and consumers || Advertising\n5.3 Advertising\n\nMost advertising contains both an informational component and a\npersuasive component. Advertisements tell us something about a\nproduct, and try to persuade us to buy it. Both of these components\ncan be subject to ethical evaluation.\n\nEmphasizing its informational component, some writers stress the\npositive value of advertising. Markets function efficiently only when\ncertain conditions are met. One of these conditions is perfect\ninformation. Minimally, consumers have to understand the features of\nthe products for sale. While this condition will never be fully met,\nadvertising can help to ensure that it is met to a greater degree\n(Heath 2014). Another value that can be promoted through advertising\nis autonomy. People have certain needs and desires\u2014e.g., to eat\nhealthy food, to drive a safe car\u2014which their choices as\nconsumers help them to satisfy. Their choices are more likely to\nsatisfy their needs and desires if they have information about what is\nfor sale, which advertising can provide (Goldman 1984).\n\nThese good effects depend, of course, on advertisements producing true\nbeliefs, or at least not producing false beliefs, in consumers.\nWriters treat this as the issue of deception in advertising. The issue\nis not whether deceptive advertising is wrong (most would agree it\nis), but what counts as deceptive advertising, and what makes it\nwrong.\n\nIn the 1980s, Beech-Nut advertised as \u201c100% apple juice\u201d a\ndrink that contained no juice of any kind. Beech-Nut was fined $2\nmillion and two of its executives went to prison. As of this writing\n(in 2021), Red Bull is marketing its energy drinks with the slogan\n\u201cRed Bull Gives You Wings,\u201d but in fact Red Bull\ndoesn\u2019t give you wings. There is no problem with Red\nBull\u2019s marketing. What\u2019s the difference? We might say that\nRed Bull\u2019s slogan is not warranted as true (Carson 2010). It is\nan example of \u201cpuffery,\u201d or over-the-top, exaggerated\npraise which no reasonable person takes seriously (Attas 1999). By\ncontrast, Beech-Nut\u2019s statement appeared to be a claim meant to\nbe taken at face value, but in fact is false. As these examples\nillustrate, advertisements are deceptive not because of the\ntruth-value of their claims, but what these claims cause reasonable\nconsumers to believe. Questions can be raised, of course, about what\nit means to be reasonable (Scalet 2003); the answer may depend on who\nthe consumers are.\n\nIntention is usually taken to be irrelevant to deception in\nadvertising. That is, an advertisement may be deemed deceptive even if\nthe advertiser doesn\u2019t intend to deceive anyone. Some\nphilosophers would say that these advertisements are better described\nas misleading. (For discussion, see the entry on\n the definition of lying and deception.)\n Regulators of advertising blur this distinction, or perhaps they\ndon\u2019t care about it. Their goal is to protect consumers from\nacting on materially false beliefs, which may be caused either by\ndeception or by blamelessly being misled.\n\nMany reasons have been offered for why deceptive advertising is wrong.\nOne is the Kantian claim that deceiving others is disrespectful to\nthem, a use of them as a mere means. Deceptive advertising may also\nlead to harm, to consumers (who purchase suboptimal products, given\ntheir desires) and competitors (who lose out on sales). A final\ncriticism of deceptive advertising is that it erodes trust in society\n(Attas 1999). When people do not trust each other, they will either\nnot engage in economic transactions, or engage in them only with\ncostly legal protections.\n\nThe persuasive component of advertising is also a fruitful subject of\nethical inquiry. Galbraith (1958), an early critic, thinks that\nadvertising, in general, does not inform people how to acquire what\nthey want, but instead gives them new wants. He calls this the\n\u201cdependence effect\u201d: our desires depend on what is\nproduced, not vice versa. Moreover, since we are inundated\nwith advertising for consumer goods, we want too many of those goods\nand not enough public goods. Hayek (1961) rejects this claim, arguing\nthat few if any of our desires are independent of our environment, and\nthat anyway, desires produced in us through advertising are no less\nsignificant than desires produced in us in other ways.\n\nGalbraith is concerned about the persuasive effects of\nadvertisements. In contrast, recent writers focus on the\ntechniques that advertisers use to persuade. Some of these\nare alleged to cross the line into manipulation (Aylsworth, 2020;\nBrenkert 2008; Sher 2011). It is difficult to define manipulation\nprecisely, though attempts have been made (for extensive discussion,\nsee the entry on\n the ethics of manipulation).\n For our purposes, manipulative advertising can be understood as\nadvertising that attempts to persuade consumers, often (but not\nnecessarily) using non-rational means, to make irrational or\nsuboptimal choices, given their own needs and desires.\n\nAssociative advertising is often identified as a type of manipulative\nadvertising. In associative advertising, the advertiser tries to\nassociate a product with a positive belief, feeling, attitude, ideal,\nor activity which usually has little to do with the product itself.\nThus many television commercials for trucks in the U.S. associate\ntrucks with manliness. Commercials for body fragrances associate those\nproducts with sex between beautiful people. The suggestion is that if\nyou are a certain sort of person (e.g., a manly one), then you will\nhave a certain sort of product (e.g., a truck). In an important\narticle, Crisp (1987) argues that this sort of advertising attempts to\ncreate desires in people by circumventing their faculties of conscious\nchoice, and in so doing subverts their autonomy (cf. Arrington 1982;\nPhillips 1994). Lippke (1989) argues that it makes people desire the\nwrong things, encouraging us to try to satisfy our non-market desires\n(e.g., to be more manly) through market means (e.g., buying a truck)\n(cf. Aylsworth 2020). How seriously we should take these criticisms\nmay depend on how effective associative and other forms of persuasive\nadvertising are. To the extent that advertisers are unsuccessful at\n\u201cgoing around\u201d our faculty of conscious choice, we may be\nless worried and more amused by their attempts to do so (Bishop 2000;\nGoldman 1984).\n\nOur judgments on this issue should be context-sensitive. While most\npeople may be able to see through advertisers\u2019 attempts to\npersuade them, some may not be (at least some of the time). Paine\n(Paine et al. 1984) argues that advertising is justified because it\nhelps consumers make wise decisions in the marketplace. But children,\nshe argues, lack the capacity for making wise consumer choices (see\nalso E.S. Moore 2004). Thus advertising directed at children\nconstitutes a form of objectionable exploitation. Other populations\nwho may be similarly vulnerable are the senile, the ignorant, and the\nbereaved. Ethics may require not a total ban on marketing to them but\nspecial care in how they are marketed to (Brenkert 2008; cf. Palmer\n& Hedberg 2013).\n",
