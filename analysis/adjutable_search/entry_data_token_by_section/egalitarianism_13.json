    "main_text": "Is Equality Desirable Per Se? Alternatives to Egalitarianism || Sufficiency\n6.1 Sufficiency\n\n\nSuppose one compares the grim conditions of life endured by the\npoorest inhabitants of the earth with the garishly opulent conditions\nof life enjoyed by the wealthiest people. A natural reaction is that it\nis morally outrageous that such inequalities in life prospects exist.\nAs George Orwell once wrote, \u201ca fat man eating quails while children\nare begging for bread is a disgusting sight\u201d (Orwell 1938, 115).\nBut one may wonder if what is troubling about the example is the gap\nbetween rich and poor or rather the deplorable condition of the poor,\nwhich might continue unabated even if the gap itself were eliminated.\nTo put the issue another way, if it is the inequality per se that is\nbad, then the gap between poor and rich would seem to be no worse than\na same-sized gap between the life prospects of the rich and super-rich.\nTalk here of a \u201csame-sized gap\u201d presupposes that we have an\nagreed standard for measuring the sizes of gaps. The claim then would\nbe that according to any plausible such standard, the gap between\nsomeone who is very badly off and someone who is much better off will\nbe far more morally significant and bad than an identical gap between\nsomeone who is extremely well off in non-comparative terms and someone\nwho is much better off than that. If the latter inequality strikes one\nas morally inconsequential, the question arises whether inequality is\nin and of itself really objectionable. Perhaps the problem is not that\nthe poor have less than the rich, but rather that the poor do not have\nenough\u2014a sufficient level of resources to provide a good life or\na reasonable prospect of a good life. The suggestion then is that\nsufficiency not equality is what per se matters. How one's condition\ncompares to the situation of other people is not important in itself.\nWhat is morally important is that people have enough to bring them over\nthe threshold of decent life prospects. (For this line of thought, see\nFrankfurt 1987 and 2000, Nussbaum 1990 and 2000, Miller 1995, Wiggins\n1991, Anderson 2000, and for an earlier statement of the sufficiency\nideal, Walzer 1983).\n\n\nThe doctrine of sufficiency holds that it is morally valuable that\nas many as possible of all who shall ever live should enjoy conditions\nof life that place them above the threshold that marks the minimum\nrequired for a decent (good enough) quality of life. Sufficiency can\nrationalize egalitarian transfers of resources from better off to worse\noff persons when such transfers would increase the total number of\npeople who ever achieve sufficiency.\n\n\nA potential problem for the sufficiency doctrine is that it may not\nbe possible non-arbitrarily to specify a line of sufficiency such that\nmoving a person just across that line has great moral significance. If\nthe sufficiency doctrine were asserted either as a complete theory of\njustice or as a principle that trumps all competitors, it would\ndefinitely be problematic. Suppose a large number of people are\nunavoidably below sufficiency, leading hellish lives, and that transfer\nof resources could vastly improve their lives while leaving them below\nthe sufficient level. Instead we could use these same resources to\nboost a single person who is now just barely under sufficiency to just\nbarely over it. Sufficiency as a trumping doctrine says that we ought\nto do what will increase the total number of persons who ever achieve\nsufficiency no matter what the cost to other moral values. This\ninstruction is worse than dubious. A similar difficulty emerges when\none imagines cases in which many people are unavoidably over the\nsufficiency level, but with a resource infusion their lives will be\nvastly improved, and in which the same resources could instead be used\nto prevent a single person now just above sufficiency from falling a\nhair beneath this line. If we try to mitigate the first concern by\nlowering the sufficiency threshold, this exacerbates the second\nconcern.\n\n\nThe doctrine just criticized is not the only one that falls under\nthe general heading of sufficientarian views. Roger Crisp (2003)\nsuggests that justice requires giving priority to making people better\noff, and greater priority to helping a person, the worse off in\nnon-comparative terms she is\u2014up to the point at which the person\nattains a good enough quality of life. Roughly speaking, the idea would\nbe priority for the worse off, up to sufficiency, and straight\nutilitarian maximization of aggregate well-being above that line. This\nis a doctrine of priority (see next section) qualified by a sufficiency\nline. The question arises, how non-arbitrarily to draw the line. The\nsufficiency skeptic might hold that the underlying moral reality is\nthat a person's well-being, in all its dimensions, varies by\ndegree, as does any overall index of well-being, and there is no\n\u201cgood enough\u201d line that has the significance the Crisp-type\nsufficientarian must give to it. A further question is how much\npriority to give to helping people below the threshold when that\ncompetes with helping people above the threshold. If one says no\ntrade-offs are allowed, that a jot of gain for a below-threshold person\noutweighs any amount of good that can be gained for any number of\nabove-threshold individuals, many will object that this is an extreme\nand wildly implausible view. But this may be one of those cases in\nwhich one person's reductio is another's Q.E.D.\n(If the sufficiency line is truly arbitrary, then giving any weight to\nit at all in determining what should be done will be excessive.)\n\n\nOther formulations of views that emphasize the moral importance of\nthe sufficiency line are possible. One says that one should bring it\nabout that, as far as is possible, over the history of the universe,\nthe total sum of the gaps between the level of lifetime well-being each\nperson achieves and the sufficiency level, for all persons whose\nlifetime well-being is below sufficiency, is as small as possible. This\nimplausibly recommends preventing any future persons from being born\nand having any life at all, if unavoidably some will fall below\nsufficiency. We might try the idea that we should seek to make the\naggregate sum of the gaps just described per person as small as\npossible for the entire history of the world. If the sufficiency line\nis deemed to be above the line of a life worth living, then if\nunavoidably at some point in the future people can only have lives\nworth living not good enough lives, the minimization of gaps-per-person\nagain yields a recommendation to bring it about that no future persons\nlive, even though they would have lives worth living. Or consider an\nAdam and Eve scenario\u2014Adam and Eve lead nice lives above the\nsufficiency line, but begetting any children and bringing it about that\nany further persons exist would be wrong to do, according to the view\nunder consideration, if it is the case that bringing about the\nexistence of future persons will unavoidably make things worse from the\nstandpoint of minimizing total gaps-per-person.\n\n\nNotice that we might deny that the sufficiency view is a rival to\negalitarianism. One might instead hold that sufficiency is a version of\negalitarianism. Sufficiency holds that all persons equally have a claim\nto live a sufficiently good life, and that people's condition is\nrelevantly and importantly equal when all equally live at or above the\nlevel of sufficiency. I assume there need be no more than verbal\ndisagreement between one who asserts and one who denies that the\nsufficiency advocate values a type of equality. (This purely verbal\ndisagreement can arise whenever someone asserts that the doctrine that\nall should equally have X or receive X treatment is an egalitarian and\nsomeone else denies that this X theory is genuinely egalitarian.)\n",
