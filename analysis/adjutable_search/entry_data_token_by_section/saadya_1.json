The Importance of Reason: The Book of Doctrines and Beliefs\n\n It is this commitment to upholding the importance of reason \u2014\nand its fruits, knowledge and certainty \u2014 that lies at the core\nof Saadya's\u00a0 main philosophical text, the Kit\u00e2b\nal-Am\u00e2n\u00e2t wal-'I\u2018tiq\u00e2d\u00e2t, or The\nBook of Doctrines and Beliefs (known in Samuel Ibn Tibbon's\nHebrew translation as Sefer ha-'Em\u00fbn\u00f4t\nve-ha-De\u00f4t). In what follows, we will refer to this text as\nthe Am\u00e2n\u00e2t. In this magnum opus, Saadya aims to\nmove people beyond the various epistemological and existential\nparalyses through which they are consigned to living always and only\nin the shadows of error and doubt.  Concerned to help cure this\ndistinctive human ill, Saadya hopes to provide people instead with\ntruth and certainty \u2014 the grounds for right living. And so,\nfollowing upon an opening passage of epistemological praise to\n\u201cthe Lord, the God of Israel, to whom the truth is known with\nabsolute certainty,\u201d Saadya begins the\nAm\u00e2n\u00e2t, with a statement of his work's\nepistemological purpose:\n\n \u2026I will begin this book, which it is my intention to write,\nwith an exposition of the reason why men, in their search for Truth,\nbecome involved in errors, and how these errors can be removed so that\nthe objects of their investigations may be fully attained; moreover,\nwhy some of these errors have such a powerful hold on some people that\nthey affirm them as the truth, deluding themselves that they know\nsomething\u2026 (Altmann,\n 27)[1]\n\n\n The sad state of affairs among men which Saadya sees as the impetus\nfor his work is described a few lines later in terms of erroneous\nlife-patterns which stem from various failures of reason:\n\n I have been led to make these introductory remarks by my observation\nof the state of many people in regard to their doctrines and beliefs\n[note: this is the title of the work]. Some there are who have arrived\nat the truth and rejoice in the knowledge that they possess\nit\u2026Others have arrived at the truth, but doubt it; they fail to\nknow it for a certainty and to hold on to it\u2026Still others\nconfidently affirm that which is false in the belief that it is true;\nthey hold on to falsehood, and abandon that which is\nright\u2026Others again base their conduct on a certain belief for a\ntime, and then reject it on account of some defect they find in it;\nthen they change over to another belief and renounce it in turn\nbecause of something in it which seems questionable to\nthem\u2026These people are changing continually all their\nlife\u2026 (Altmann, 28-9)\n \n\n Concerned to remedy a people's inability to surmount error and doubt,\nSaadya's epistemological curative is directly in the service of life:\nSaadya wants to be able to provide his readers with the capacity to\nknow truly and with certainty because he wants to provide them\na genuine space in which to live truly and with certainty. \n\n Saadya, we may say, essentially sets out to provide his readers with\na dual reason-based and faith-based ground for living. It is in the\nservice of this dual-ground for living that Saadya grapples throughout\nhis text with the question of reason's relation to revelation,\nbeginning with an analysis of four modes of proper knowing,\nviz. knowledge from sense perception, knowledge from reason, knowledge\nfrom inference and knowledge from tradition. \n",
