    "main_text": "Testimony\n6. Testimony\n\nAmong the very many topics Anscombe worked on, her ideas about the\nrole of testimony have prefigured or influenced much contemporary\nthought on the topic. We will summarize three of her short but\nimportant papers on testimony: \u201cHume and Julius Caesar\u201d\n(HJC), \u201cWhat Is It to Believe Someone?\u201d (WBS), and\n\u201cAuthority in Morals\u201d (AIM), each of which heralds ideas\nthat gained prominence in philosophy only later.\n\nIn HJC, she considers Hume\u2019s answer to the question, how do we\nknow about historical events? For example, how do we know that Caesar\nwas killed on the Ides of March? How do we even know that Caesar was a\nreal man, and not a mythical figure like Electra? Hume\u2019s answer\nwas essentially that you perceive or remember someone (perhaps your\nschool teacher) telling you about Caesar, and you next infer the cause\nof that \u2013 namely, that someone told them \u2013 and so on,\nuntil you infer that there were eyewitnesses in the Senate, who then\nwitnessed Caesar\u2019s death. You thus infer the original event\nthrough a series of causes terminating in something you perceive or\nremember perceiving.\n\nAnscombe argued that Hume\u2019s answer cannot be right. First, is it\nreally true that we infer that Caesar was killed on the Ides of March\nfrom the thought there were many observant people in the\nSenate that day? No. If anything, it\u2019s the other way around:\ngiven that we think that Caesar was killed then and there, we\ninfer that there must have been eyewitnesses to his death. It is not\nthat we first establish the presence of these people, and only then\ninfer what caused them to say what they said.\n\nAnscombe also discussed \u201cone of the rare pieces of stupidity in\nthe writings of Wittgenstein\u201d (HJC, 89). He once wrote that if\nwe were to find a piece of writing saying Caesar never existed, and\nwas invented for other ends, this would be some evidence that Caesar\nnever existed. Anscombe pushes us to think further about this. If we\nwere to discover such a document, we would instead immediately\nconclude it to be worthless, this because it conflicts with so much we\nhave been taught about the history of the West. She thus opposed the\nidea that our belief in Caesar\u2019s existence rests upon any\nevidence we have for it, rather than from our directly\ntrusting what we have been taught. A coherentist might reply that any\ndocument alleging Caesar\u2019s nonexistence clashes with the\npreponderance of historical evidence we have about him, and that we\ncan check the claims of this document against these other sources of\nevidence. But Anscombe rejoins that these other sources of\n\u201cevidence\u201d are themselves historians who straightforwardly\nbelieve much of what they have been taught, and we believe them. Thus,\nwe cannot \u201creduce\u201d testimony to some other source of\njustification. Believing testimony is basic.\n\nShe provocatively concludes the essay\n\n[N]ot everything can be put up for checking. Von Neurath\u2019s image\nof the ship which we repair \u2013 and, I suppose, build on to\n\u2013 while it is afloat: if this suggests that we can go round\ntapping every plank for rottenness, and so we might end up with a\nwholly different ship, the analogy is not good. For there are things\nthat are on a level. A general epistemological reason for doubting one\nwill be a reason for doubting all, and then none of them would have\nanything to test it(HJC, 92)\n\n\nShe thus opposes epistemological coherentism about justification, or\nat least a certain popular version of it. The many sources of\ninformation about Caesar\u2019s life are themselves equally\nvulnerable to skepticism, and so we cannot actually test the former\nwhile trusting the latter. Without trusting what we have been taught,\nwe have almost no historical knowledge.\n\nWell before C. A. J. Coady\u2019s masterful monograph on testimony\n(1992) that revived widespread interest in the topic, Anscombe\npublished a little essay titled \u201cWhat Is It to Believe\nSomeone?\u201d, anticipating many points he and others later\ndeveloped. She wrote that the topic of believing someone is not merely\nneglected but actually unknown in the philosophical discussion of her\ntime. Yet she avers that it is \u201cof great importance in\nphilosophy and in life\u201d, for \u201cthe greater part of our\nknowledge of reality rests upon the belief that we repose in things we\nhave been taught and told\u201d. What is it, then, for a\nperson, rather than a proposition, to be the object of\nbelief?\n\nAnscombe distinguishes believing a person from believing what a person\nsays, for you can do the latter without the former \u2013 both when\nyou already believe what is said, and when you believe that the person\nis both misinformed and yet trying to deceive you. Anscombe describes\nmany \u201cpresuppositions\u201d to believing someone: noticing the\nrelevant sound or inscription, understanding it as an attempt to\ncommunicate, noticing that it is addressed to oneself, understanding\nit properly, understanding that it was produced by the person indeed\nproducing it, and many more. Only once all these are in place do we\ncome to the situation where we can ask: \u201cDoes he believe\nher?\u201d\n\nIt is no small matter whether people trust you when you tell them\nthings. Anscombe claimed \u201cIt is an insult and it may be an\ninjury not to be believed\u201d (WBS, 9). Although she does not\nelaborate upon the nature of the insult and injury, her claim\nforeshadows contemporary discussions of epistemic injustice.\nInterestingly, it can be insulting, she notes, not even to be\nheard as telling one something. For example, if you tell me\np, but I fail to note that you were telling me anything\n\u2013 perhaps I thought you were just venting aloud \u2013 you\nmight reasonably say that I disrespectfully failed to believe you. We\ncan wrong one another by refusing to accept one another\u2019s word,\nan idea that has recently become widely discussed at the intersection\nof epistemology and ethics.\n\nIn the third paper on testimony, \u201cAuthority in Morals\u201d,\nAnscombe again considers a few related questions that only recently\nhave become widely discussed: can one person aptly tell another what\nto think about morality, and can the hearer aptly trust what they are\nthus told? Given that the paper was originally presented at a\nconference in an abbey, much of her discussion involves trusting a\nreligious authority about moral truths. But her points generalize.\n\nAnscombe compares moral teaching to mathematical teaching: in both\ncases, one must do something to truly learn what is being\ntaught, rather than merely accepting something as to be believed.\nTeaching someone either morality or mathematics thus won\u2019t just\ninvolve the formation of belief. Even so, she denies that a proper\nunderstanding of autonomy is incompatible with trusting moral\ntestimony: deciding to trust someone who tells you about a bit of\nmoral truth can be a way of thinking for oneself. A man who\ndoes this and acts on this testimony is still \u201chis own\npilot\u201d (AIM, 49).\n\nYet there are limits to moral testimony. Although she thinks certain\ndogmatic truths are religiously revealed and could not otherwise be\nknown, this is not so for moral truths. Moral truths may be\nreligiously revealed only per accidens. In other words, moral\ntruths can always be known other than by trusting some\nsource. There seems to be no room for moral truths that per\nse can be taken only through trust.\n\nOne way moral truths can be revealed per accidens is when\nsomeone relies on an authority for a moral claim that they in some\nsense could have thought out for themselves, but didn\u2019t.\nAnscombe does not imply that so relying need be a sign of laziness;\nrather, she thinks that different people have already grasped\ndifferent parts of the moral law (AIM, 45), and so seems to think that\nsharing moral truths is much like sharing other truths. For example,\nif you tell me what you ate for lunch, I can reasonably trust you even\nif in principle it\u2019s true that I could have instead spied on you\nto find out. Likewise, I might reasonably believe you when you tell me\nsome moral truth that I hadn\u2019t worked out for myself (but, in\ntheory, could).\n\nThe second way moral truths can be revealed per accidens is\nwhen their factual grounds are knowable only by religious revelation.\nFor example, consider the ascetic life. As Hume noted, there seems to\nbe nothing good about it. And so if someone were to tell you that it\nis indeed good, there would be no question of believing them.\n\nBut now suppose you come to accept certain ordinary (non-moral) truths\nof revealed religion: the doctrine of original sin, and the\npossibility of joining your suffering with that of Christ. Now in\nlight of accepting these ideas, it becomes possible to see for\nyourself that there is indeed something good about the ascetic life.\nSo, you need not accept this moral claim itself on the basis of\nreligious revelation, but you accept it on the basis of other truths\nthemselves accepted as revelation. Moral truths, however,\nalways can in principle be graspable without needing to trust another.\nEven though there need be nothing bad about trusting an authority who\nteaches about morality, their teachings, if true, could be\narrived at otherwise.\n",
