    "preamble": "\n\nPhilosophy of Liberation is the collective name for a philosophical\nmovement and method of doing philosophy that emerged at first in\nArgentina during the late sixties, but that went on to spread\nthroughout Latin American during the early seventies. It is for this\nreason that sometimes some critics and historiographers of the\nphilosophy of liberation make reference to a \u201cstrict\u201d and\na \u201cbroad\u201d conception of the philosophy of liberation, in\norder to refer to the immediate context of its earliest articulations,\nand to its later general dissemination and development. The philosophy\nof liberation belongs to the \u201cmaturity\u201d stage within the\n\u201ccontemporary\u201d period of Latin American philosophy, if we\nuse Jorge J.E. Gracia and Manuel Vargas\u2019s periodization of Latin\nAmerican philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013). Without question,\nhowever, the philosophy of liberation is the distinct manifestation of\nLatin American philosophy that has received the most international\nattention, and that has had the most influence both within Latin\nAmerica and the United\n States[1].\n\nWhile the philosophy of liberation is deeply rooted in the history and\ndebates of Latin American philosophy, to the extent that it may be\nclaimed that it is the most elaborate and substantive response to the\ntask articulating a distinct Latin American philosophy, it is\nnonetheless also a chapter within the broader history of European\nphilosophy. Even as it defines itself as a critique of Eurocentrism\nand the hegemony of European philosophy, it has evolved out of and\nmade use of its philosophical currents, movements, concepts and\ndebates. Some may be argue that the philosophy of liberation belongs\nto phenomenology, hermeneutics, and Marxism, or more generally,\nhistorical materialism. In fact, because many philosophers of\nliberation came out of these different traditions, the philosophy of\nliberation was and remains from the outset an internally heterogeneous\nmovement. This heterogeneity has increased as some philosophers have\nengaged in what Enrique Dussel has called a \u201cSouth-South\nDialogue,\u201d in which philosophies from the so-called\n\u201cglobal south\u201d address each other directly without\ndeferring to the authority of dominant Euro-American philosophy\n(Dussel 2015).\n\nThe philosophy of liberation aims to think the distinct place and role\nof Latin American in world history using what are argued to be\nautochthonous cultural and intellectual resources, from out of a\nsituation of economic, cultural, political, and philosophical\ndependency. It has a practical aim: liberation. In very general terms,\nthe philosophy of liberation defines itself as a counter-philosophical\ndiscourse, whether it be as a critique of colonialism, imperialism,\nglobalization, racism, and sexism, which is articulated from out of\nthe experience of exploitation, destitution, alienation and\nreification, in the name of the projects of liberation, autonomy and\nauthenticity. That is, the philosophy of liberation has presented\nitself as an \u201cepistemic rupture\u201d that aims to critique and\nchallenge not only basic assumptions and themes of Euro-American\nphilosophy, but also to make philosophy more responsive to\u00a0and\nresponsible for the socio-political situation in which it always finds\nitself. Thus, by \u201ccounter-philosophical discourse\u201d,\nphilosophers of liberation did not mean that it was\n\u201canti-philosophical\u201d. Instead, they meant to emphasize a\nheightened degree of reflexiveness or self-awareness in their\ntheorizing. Positively, the philosophy of liberation affirms cultural\ndiversity, gender and racial equality, and political sovereignty. In\nmore recent years, some philosophers of liberation have been using the\nlanguage of \u201cpluriversality,\u201d instead of\n\u201cuniversality,\u201d to refer to this fundamental affirmation\nand celebration of global cultural diversity (Dussel 2015; Mignolo\n2011). The philosophy of liberation\u2019s philosophical orbit is\ndefined by the axes of critique, commitment, engagement, and\nliberation. As a critique of all forms of philosophical dependency and\ninauthenticity, it is consciously and avowedly a metaphilosophy. The\nphilosophy of liberation is thus, among other things, a view about\nwhat counts as philosophy and how it should be pursued.\n\nThis article is divided into four main parts: history, background,\ncurrents, and themes and debates.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History\n\nAs was noted, the philosophy of liberation belongs to the\n\u201cmaturity\u201d stage of the \u201ccontemporary\u201d period\nof the history of Latin American philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013;\nGracia 1988\u201389). As a philosophical movement that engages in the\ncritical task of recovering what is distinctly \u201cLatin\nAmerican\u201d thought, it has sought explicitly to unearth and\nrescue Amerindian thought, in its pre-Colombian and post-Conquest\nforms, as well as all the different philosophical tendencies and\nmovements that emerged during the long history of colonialism,\nindependence and projects of national formation. It is for this reason\nthat the philosophy of liberation has as one of its goals a critical\nhistoriography of Latin American thought, specifically, and philosophy\ntout court, in general. Figures such as Enrique Dussel,\nRodolfo Kusch, Arturo Roig, and Leopoldo Zea have articulated their\nversions of the philosophy of liberation in terms of a recovery of\nearlier stages in the formulation of a project of Latin American\nliberation. Yet, the philosophy of liberation as a self-conscious\nmovement and current, emerged out of a very distinct convergence of\ngeo-historical, cultural, intellectual and philosophical tendencies,\nconflicts and processes.\n1.1 The Long History\n\nThe philosophy of liberation, arguably, began in the late sixties when\nLeopoldo Zea and Augusto Salazar Bondy launched a debate with the\nquestion: \u201cIs there a Latin American philosophy?\u201d Whether\nthe answer was affirmative or negative did not affect the fact that\nthe movement would have to embark on the long path of the recovery of\nLatin American philosophy, at the very least in order to identify\nthose moments of originality and authentically autochthonous Latin\nAmerican thinking. It is for this reason that some philosophers\nliberation have argued that there are at least three antecedent\nhistorical stages that serve as the geological subsoil of liberation\nphilosophy. Following Dussel, they could be sketched as follows\n(Dussel 2005: 374\u20135):\n\nFirst Period. This is the period of the beginning of the\ncritique of the conquest and the development of a discourse that\nengages Amerindian thought. An important inaugural date is 1511 when\nAnt\u00f3n de Montesinos critiques the way evangelization is taking\nplace in the Americas. This is the period when a distinct continental\nawareness of the injustice that is being committed against the\nindigenous populations of the so-called New World emerges. The debate\nbetween Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda and Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de\nlas Casas at Valladolid in 1550 marks the clear emergence of a\nliberation discourse and consciousness. In this debate\nSep\u00falveda articulated a moment in the emergent imperial and\ncolonizing modern consciousness of Europe when he argued that\nAmerindians were naturally born slaves and that therefore they were to\nbe subjugated. Sep\u00falveda questioned the humanity of Amerindians\n(Dussel 2007, 2007a; Ruiz Sotelo 2010). In contrast, de las Casas\naffirmed the rational humanity of Amerindians, while acknowledging\ntheir distinctiveness. In fact, de las Casas affirms their rationality\nand treats appeals to their reason as a theological and evangelical\nnorm. The only true way for evangelization is the path of\nrational deliberation and not violent religious usurpation and\nimposition.\n\nSecond Period. This epoch is defined by the process of what\nmight be called the first emancipation, from 1750 until the end of the\nnineteenth century. Defining figures are Benito Diaz de Gamarra, who\npublished in 1774 his Elementa Recientioris Philosophiae,\nCarlos de Sing\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora, and Francisco Xavier\nClavigero, who articulated an anti-colonial and anti-absolutist\npolitical philosophy that launched a critique of the Spanish monarchy.\nSome of the notable figures of this epoch include Fray Servando Teresa\nde Mier (1763\u20131827), Manuel M. Moreno (in La Plata, what would\nbecome Argentina, 1778\u20131811), Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (in\nVenezuela, 1751\u20131854), Sim\u00f3n Bolivar (1783\u20131830),\nFrancisco de Miranda (1750\u20131816), Juan Germ\u00e1n Roscio\n(1763\u20131821). In the eighteenth century, these thinkers and many\nother \u201cpatriotras\u201d articulated a political\ndiscourse of emancipation from the Spanish crown. They called for\ncontinental independence, as well as the development of a distinct\n\u201cAmerican\u201d identity. Because of her blend of poetry,\ntheological speculation, praise of Amerindian traditions, and nascent\nfeminist awareness, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1651\u20131695)\nshould\u00a0also be considered a contributor to this first discourse\nof emancipation and should be included among the figures that define\nthis epoch.\n\nThird Period.This epoch could characterized as a second\nmoment of emancipation, beginning at the end of the nineteen century\nand being bookended with the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Defining\nfigures are Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui (1894\u20131930),\nwhose book Siete ensayos sobre la realidad peruana (Seven\nInterpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality) (1968) gave expression to a\nnew emancipation agenda that is explicitly elaborated in terms of a\ndual approach that is attentive to the historical reality of the\nAmericas, with its indigenous and criollo backgrounds. It\nlaunched a critical appropriation of European ideas in the\n\u201cLatin American\u201d context. This epoch is defined by the\ncrises of both development efforts and populisms that were inattentive\nto the severe racial, ethnic, and class divisions within the Latin\nAmerican nations. It is against this context that Augusto Salazar\nBondy (1925\u20131974) and Leopoldo Zea (1912\u20132004) began to\ndebate the question whether there is a Latin American philosophy. This\nthird period is defined by the explicit consciousness of economic,\npolitical, social, and cultural dependence, under-development, and\ndomination (Vallega 2014). It is in this period that the need of a\ndiscourse of liberation begins to be explicitly articulated.\n1.2 The Immediate History\n\nThis section discusses the broader social and intellectual context of\nthe third period indicated above, from which an explicit and nuanced\nphilosophy of liberation would emerge.\n\nAn important part of the origin of the philosophy of liberation as an\nautochthonous philosophical movement was rooted in the question of a\ndistinct or authentic Latin American philosophy. The problem of a\ndistinct Latin American philosophy has been in gestation at least\nsince the late nineteen century, when the so-called \u201cgeneration\nof patriarchs\u201d began to ask about a philosophy or thinking from\nand for the \u201cAmericas\u201d (Beorlegui 2004). This problem took\na distinct shape when Salazar Bondy (1968) re-framed it in terms of\nthe question as to the actual existence of a Latin American\nphilosophy. Using existentialist and Marxist categories, Salazar Bondy\ngave a negative answer. There is no authentic Latin American\nphilosophy because the sub-continent has lived and developed under\nconditions of mental colonialism, intellectual subordination, and\nphilosophical dependence. In order to achieve an authentic Latin\nAmerican philosophy, Salazar Bondy maintained, the sub-continent had\nto achieve its independence and establish its autonomy and\nself-determination. These thoughts, and Zea\u2019s subsequent\nresponse (1969), set the agenda for a generation. The philosophy of\nliberation , so explicitly christened, it could be argued, has gone\nthrough at least the following three stages: constitution and\nmaturation, persecution and exile, challenges and debates (Dussel\n2005; Beorlegui 2004; Cerutti Guldberg 1983 [2006]).\n\nConstitution and Maturation (1969\u20131975). The philosophy\nof liberation was explicitly labeled as such at the Second Argentine\nNational Congress of Philosophy, which was held in Cordoba in 1971\n(Dussel 2017). The inaugurating group was conformed by Osvaldo\nArdiles, Alberto Parisini, Juan Carlos Scannone, Julio de Zan, and\nAnibal Fornari. But this group took a more formal shape at the\njornadas (week long working seminars) of philosophy that were\norganized at the Jesuit University, Universidad of San Salvador (where\nPope Francis was educated), in San Miguel, in the outskirts of Buenos\nAires, Argentina. The first jornada took place in 1971, and a\nsecond was held later the same year with the title \u201cLatin\nAmerican Liberation\u201d. A third jornada was held in 1973,\nat which Salazar Bondy gave a paper titled \u201cFilosof\u00eda de\nla dominacion y filosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n (Philosophy\nof Domination and Philosophy of Liberation\u201d (1973), and Leopoldo\nZea gave a paper titled \u201cLa filosof\u00eda latinoamericana\ncomo filosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n (Latin American\nPhilosophy as a Philosophy of Liberation)\u201d (1973). This\nstage comes to a close in 1975 with the First Mexican National\nCongress of Philosophy in Morelia, Mexico, with papers by Dussel,\nMir\u00f3 Quesada, Arturo Roig, and Abelardo Villegas. This was an\nimportant meeting because it signaled the launching of the philosophy\nliberation as a Latin American philosophical agenda that supersedes\nits initial Argentine formulations. A new group of philosophers from\nacross Latin America entered into the debate: Hugo Assmann, Carlos\nBaz\u00e1n, Arturo Roig,\n\nIn 1974 the journal Revista de Filosof\u00eda\nLatinoamericana begins to be edited and published in Buenos\nAires, and goes on to become a major publishing venue for philosophers\nof liberation, along with Stromata, published at the\nUniversity of El Salvador, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in which many\nof the inaugural essays and quasi-manifestos of the movement were\npublished.\n\nPersecution and Exile (1975\u20131983). Following the\nmilitary lead coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Mar\u00eda Estela\nMart\u00ednez Per\u00f3n in March of 1976, there began a period\ncalled the \u201cdirty war,\u201d which was in fact a form of\n\u201cstate terrorism,\u201d that included the persecution and\nassassination of philosophers affiliated with the nascent movement of\nthe philosophy of liberation. Due to their persecution, many went into\nexile, moving to Canada, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. One of\nthe consequences of this persecution was that hitherto Argentine\nproject of a Latin American philosophy of liberation was brought to\nother parts of Latin America, making it into a continental project.\nHowever, the Latin American dictatorships of the sixties and the Cold\nWar in general, had directly influenced internal debates about the\n\u201cwho\u201d of Latin American philosophy, and consequently had\npolarizing and decisive effects for how liberation was understood. The\nrole of populism and nationalism in defining the task of philosophy\nbecame a litmus test. In 1980, the AFYL (Asociaci\u00f3n Filosofia y\nLiberaci\u00f3n [Philosophy and Liberation Association]), was\nestablished in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and it become a major vehicle\nfor organizing congresses, round tables, and sessions at international\nphilosophy congresses.\n\nChallenges and Debates (1983 to today). With the transition\nto democracy and the collapse or defeat of the military dictatorships\nin Latin America there began a new stage in the normalization and\nmaturation of liberation philosophy. Horacio Cerutti Guldberg\u2019s\nFilosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n latinoamericana\n(Philosophy of Latin American Liberation) (2006) offered the\nmost comprehensive historical and critical reconstruction of the\nmovement. In 1988\u201389, Jorge J.E. Gracia edited a special issue\non \u201cLatin American Philosophy\u201d, with a long essay by\nCerutti Guldberg in which a synoptic overview of the movement is\npresented. In 1993, Ofelia Schutte published her Cultural Identity\nand Social Liberation in Latin American Thought in which a\ncritical confrontation with some key theses of liberation philosophy\nis developed. These substantive texts signaled the maturity and\ngeneral coherence of the philosophy of liberation, at the very least\nas it was perceived by its critics. These works called for\nre-articulations and reformulations that made explicit the inner\ntensions and divisions within the group of thinkers that had first\ngiven voice to this new current and method of doing philosophy in\nLatin America.\n\nThese differences and divergences have become increasingly pronounced.\nIt may now no longer be possible to speak of a \u201cphilosophy of\nliberation\u201d, in the singular. Instead, it may be more\nappropriate to speak of \u201cphilosophies of\nliberation\u201d, in the plural, where what is shared is a set of\noverlapping themes among the distinct accounts of what are the\nsituations and conditions from which liberation is to be sought, and\ndifferent philosophical methods and traditions used to articulate\nthose accounts . To be sure, there remains a substantive core that\nholds together the constellation of the philosophy of liberation now\nin the middle of its fourth decade of existence. Widely shared\ncharacteristics of the various philosophies of liberation include the\nfollowing:\n\nAn indisputable point of departure for all philosophers liberation\nis the consciousness of the economic, social, political and cultural\ndependence of Latin America on Europe and the United States.\nThe general affirmation that \u201cphilosophy\u201d has to be\npracticed from a specific context of both engagement and commitment\nwithin the distinct Latin American historical and geopolitical\nsituation. The claim is that implicitly or explicitly all\nphilosophizing is always a form of commitment with an existential\nsituation. All philosophers of liberation share the conviction that a\nphilosophy that is worthy of that name is a tool or means of\nenlightenment, a theoretical elaboration at the service of a\npraxis of liberation. The philosophy of liberation is the\ntwin of a practice of emancipation.\nAll philosophizing is done out of a concrete historical situation.\nYet, this \u201cconcrete historical\u201d situation has received\ndifferent formulations, which define the different currents within the\nphilosophy of liberation (see\n section 3,\n below). For now, we can note that the \u201cpoint of\ndeparture\u201d can be a people, nation, or autochthonous culture; it\ncan refer to a class or economic group understood along Marxist lines;\nit can include a cultural, historical, existential project that\nmanifests itself in terms of a historical formation or agent.\nAs a critique of putatively colonized thinking and dependent\nphilosophy, the philosophy of liberation is a metaphilosophy. For this\nreason, issues of method are integral to its philosophical agenda. In\ntandem with the different \u201cpoints of departure\u201d for\nphilosophy that is authentically grounded, different liberation\nphilosophers argue on behalf of the virtues of one or another\nphilosophical method or current. Thus, we find some philosophers of\nliberation who are \u201cindigenistas\u201d, some who at one time or\nanother were Ricoeuerian, Heideggerian, Levinasian; others who were\nDiltheyan, Gadamerian, and Gaosian and/or Ortegian, and some who were\nMarxists. The philosophy of liberation, which is critical of European\nphilosophy, is so from within, immanently, even when some of its\nrepresentatives argue from some \u201canalectical\u201d standpoint,\nor standpoint of metaphysical \u201cexteriority\u201d to imperial\nand totalizing thought. It is thus not surprising that philosophy\n\u201ccompanions\u201d or handbooks to Existentialism,\nPhenomenology, Marxism, or to figures such as Martin Heidegger, Karl\nMarx, Emmanuel Levinas, include entries on \u201cphilosophy of\nliberation\u201d, or some of its most representative figures.\nInasmuch at it is defined by the word \u201cliberation\u201d,\nall philosophy of liberation is entangled with the project of\nsketching an utopia and identifying the \u201csubject\u201d of the\nconstruction of such an utopia. The utopia of liberation entails\neither recognizing the suppressed historical subject, or forging a new\none. This liberation or emancipating subject could\nbe\u00a0\u201cel pueblo\u201d, or the proletarian class, or\nthe popular sectors, made up by the \u201cpueblo\u201d now\nunderstood as the destitute and exploited of the nation. For others,\nas we will see, this subject is constituted by the nation as it is\nembodied in its popular sector. That sector is not understood simply\nin terms of class or even cultural identity, but in terms of an\nanti-colonial attitude aimed at national sovereignty.\n\n\nThese general and shared characteristics, problems and themes could be\nsummarized in three observations about the coherence and unity of the\nphilosophy of liberation.. First, there is a general agreement that\nLatin American philosophy must be a philosophy of liberation that aims\nat overcoming dependence, domination and subordination. Second, there\nis ample disagreement as to the who, what, or how, is this project of\nliberation to be undertaken. Third, there is also ample disagreement\nas to the \u201ccontent\u201d or final goal of liberation. In short,\nthe philosophy of liberation is defined by what many would argue is\nintegral to all philosophy as such, namely questioning the general\nindividual existential situation of alienation, the corresponding\nproject of liberation, and what the utopia of achieved liberation\ncould and would look like. Philosophers of liberation argue,\nnevertheless, that this questioning takes on a universal character\nonly and precisely because it is taken up from within a specific and\nunique existential, historical, and geo-political situation.\n2. Background\n\nLike all philosophical movements and traditions, the philosophy of\nliberation emerged out of both world historical and regional\nsocio-historical contexts. In terms of the world historical\nbackground, World War II, and in particular the disclosures about the\ngenocide of the Jews, the Cold War, and the South East Asian wars,\ncreated a world historical stage in which Europe and its intellectual\nand moral traditions stood discredited. Whereas before, all things\nEuropean were regarded as the standard against which everything would\nhave to be measured, Europe had become suspect. Latin Americans had to\nlook elsewhere for inspiration and intellectual guidance.\n\nThe regional socio-historical situation was framed, on the one side,\nby the Cuban revolution, and the numerous military dictatorships\nthroughout the Latin American subcontinent, on the other, that took\nplace as a consequence of the Cold War and the failures of economic\ndevelopment in Latin America. The Cuban revolution, however, had a\nprofound impact in the socio-political-cultural imagination throughout\nLatin America. In the iconic image of Che Guevara (1928\u20131967),\nthe revolution promise a transformation of the Latin American human\nbeing\u2014el nuevo hombre\u2014as it also raised the\npossibility of political sovereignty for Latin American nations. The\ndecade of the sixties in Latin American was a time of political\nturmoil, but above all of cultural renewal and utopian yearning.\n\nThe philosophy of liberation, however, was above all an intellectual\nand philosophical response and unquestionably synthesis of a series of\nintellectual and cultural movements that had been gestating for a\ndecade throughout Latin America. The cultural context was so ripe with\nproclamations and thinking about \u201cliberation\u201d that if the\nphilosophy of liberation had not been so named in the late sixties and\nearly seventies, today we would have wondered whether philosophers had\nbeen abducted from this world and sequestered in some time capsule.\nThe philosophy of liberation was both necessary and inevitable.\n\nDrawing on the work of Carlos Beorlegui, a historian of Latin American\nphilosophy, we can say that there are some identifiable\n\u201cmatrixes\u201d, or intellectual sources, from which liberation\nphilosophy emerged (Beorlegui 2004:\n 677\u2013690).[2]\n Here, they will be characterized as follows.\n\nThe Economic Matrix: The Theory of Dependence. After the end\nof World War II, the United States undertook to finance the\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d of Latin America on the model of\nindustrialized and capitalist nations. This is what the Alliance for\nProgress (1961\u20131973) aimed to do this by granting loans that\nwould help economically underdeveloped nations to ascend the ladder of\neconomic development. This program was guided by the economic theory\ncalled \u201cdesarrollismo\u201d or\ndevelopmentalism. Yet, Latin American nations continue to lag\nbehind both socially and economically.\n\nIt is in the face of this failure that a series of economists began to\ndevelop \u201cdependency theory\u201d, or the \u201ctheory of the\ndevelopment of underdevelopment\u201d, among who were: Theothonio dos\nSantos, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Enzo Falleto, Celso Furtado, and\nAnibal Quijano. The core of this theory was that the underdevelopment\nof the Latin American nation was not due to endogenous factors, but\nrather was a direct consequence of economic dependence on Europe and\nthe United States. The model of development that reigned during the\nfifties and sixties, according to these theorists, had a double\nperverse effect: greater capital accumulation in the metropolises and\nlending nations, and greater indebtedness and impoverishment in the\nso-called underdeveloped nations. The economic underdevelopment of\nLatin America was now to be understood in terms of an economic theory\nthat showed that underdevelopment is not a prior stage in the natural\neconomic development of nations, but rather an integral dimension of\nthe international economic order created by colonialism, imperialism,\nand neo-imperialism.\n\nThe Religious Matrix: The Theology of Liberation. The\nemergence of Liberation Theology has been amply documented and studied\nin the specialized literature. Yet, liberation theology is as much a\nphenomenon of global Catholicism as it is a unique Latin American\ndevelopment. The reforms began with Vatican II (1962\u20131965) and\nthe Second Latin American Bishops congregation in Medell\u00edn,\nColombia (1968), created the church context for the consolidation of\nwhat was in effect a social movement, namely the\n\u201ccommunidades de base\u201d (base communities). The\ntheology of liberation developed in response to a new understanding of\nthe church\u2019s relationship to the \u201cpeople\u201d and the\nrole of the faith in a world of incredible poverty and social\ninequality.\n\nThe theology of liberation forged a whole new language: the\n\u201cpreferential option for the poor\u201d, the \u201cunderside\nof history\u201d, \u201cthe church of the people\u201d,\n\u201corthopraxis is prior to orthodoxy\u201d that influenced some\nphilosophers of liberation. Still, two of the most important\ncontributions of the theology of liberation to the philosophy of\nliberation were the imperative that critical reflection had to emerge\nout of committed praxis, and the problematization of the\nconcept of \u201cel pueblo\u201d. The theology of\nliberation may be understood as theological reflection on what\nconstituted a people, a community of faith. In short, theology of\nliberation asks: who is the subject of God\u2019s soteriology. Most\nnoteworthy is that Gustavo Gutierrez published his Teolog\u00eda\nde la liberaci\u00f3n. Perspectivas (A Theology of Liberation)\nin 1971 in Peru, while Hugo Assmann published his\nOpresi\u00f3n-Liberaci\u00f3n: desaf\u00edo a los\ncristianos (Oppression-Liberation: Challenge to\nChristians) the same year in Chile. The Catholic Church also\nprovided an institutional framework within which some of the work of\nphilosophers of liberation could be pursued by hosting\n\u201cjornadas\u201d, sponsoring congresses, and providing\nteaching opportunities in its affiliated universities for philosophers\nof liberation, many who had been expelled from public\nuniversities.\n\nThe Educational Matrix: The Pedagogy of the Oppressed. In\n1970, after nearly two decades of literacy work in the Brazilian\nfavelas and poor sectors of Brazil, Paulo Freire published\nhis paradigm shifting text Pedagogia del oprimido\n(Pedagogy of the Oppressed) (1970), which was followed in\n1972 by his Education for the Praxis of Liberation. At the\ncore of Freire\u2019s work were three key ideas: if the people are to\novercome their dependence, they can only do so through their own\nagency, by becoming the subject of their own liberation; to become a\nsubject of one\u2019s own liberation means to engage in a process of\nconscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o, or consciousness raising, that\ntakes place through a pedagogy that rejects the notion of the learner\nas a passive receptacle and instead departs from the fundamental\nrealization that learning is a dynamic process. Two key notions of\nFreire\u2019s pedagogy of liberation were that (1) teaching requires\nlistening to the people, and (2) schooling means life, that is,\nlearning is both indispensable to life and it takes place in the midst\nof living. Freire\u2019s key phrase\n\u201cconscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d goes on to be\nappropriated by liberation philosophers as their own goal: philosophy\nis at the service of the raising of both individual and collective\nconsciousness.\n\nThe Literary-Artistic Matrix: The Boom and the Muralists. It\nis often forgotten that the sixties were the time of the Latin\nAmerican literary Boom. This is the decade when Jos\u00e9 M.\nArguedas, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel\nGarc\u00eda-M\u00e1rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Octavio Paz, Juan\nRulfo, Ernesto S\u00e1bato published their major works. During this\ndecade there also emerged a genre that gave expression to the heavy\nconsciousness of dependence and the spirit of rebellion and quest for\nemancipation, namely the Novelas de Guerrilla; among which\nare Julio de la Vega\u2019s Mat\u00edas, el ap\u00f3stol\nsuplente (1971, Jes\u00fas Lara\u2019s\n\u00d1aucahuaz\u00fa, Sue\u00f1os (1969, Renato Prada\nOropeza\u2019s, Los fundadores del alba (1969), Gaby Vallejo\nde Bol\u00edvar\u2019s Los Vulnerables (1973, Oscar Uzin\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s, La oscuridad radiante (1976). Just\nas these writers demonstrated how a distinct Latin American literary\ntradition could be forged, the muralists demonstrated how standards of\nartistic beauty that celebrated proudly the aesthetic sensibility and\ncreativity of the continent. The est\u00e9tica indigenista\n(indigeneous aesthetics) celebrates by muralists like Diego\nOrozco, Rivera, Siqueiros, and painters like Frida Kahlo, created a\nnew iconic representation of the Latin American people that more\necumenically reflected the continent\u2019s mestizaje, or\nracial mixing and hybridity.\n\nThe Sociological Matrix: The Sociology of Liberation. The\nfifties and sixties, as was already noted, were decades of tremendous\nsocial-economic-political turmoil throughout Latin America. Latin\nAmerican industrialization went in tandem with massive urbanization\nand de-ruralization. Extensive migrations from the countryside to the\ncities gave rise to the shantytowns that are so distinctly visible in\nmost Latin American metropolises. Sociologist began to address the\nunique challenges of de-ruralization and urbanization. In Colombia,\nsociologist Orlando Fals Borda, who worked with Colombian peasants,\nbegan to develop what he called a \u201csociology of\nliberation\u201d that meant to address the very unique situation of\nthe urban and rural poor in contexts in which the state was nearly\nabsent. Fals Borda studied in particular the ways in which the poor\ncreated their own institutions and norms of social interaction.\nCombined with the theory of dependence, the sociology of liberation,\ncreated an interdisciplinary matrix that sought to address the\nconditions of systemic inequity, while raising the norm that people\ncould be the agents of their own liberation.\n\nIt is clear that both dependence and liberation were in the lips of\neconomists, sociologists, theologians, and writers. The philosophy of\nliberation gave expression in concepts what was a lived local and\nglobally interlinked experience.\n3. Currents\n\nLike existentialism, hermeneutics, phenomenology, and\npoststructuralism, the philosophy of liberation was never a\nhomogeneous or monolithic movement. From its inception the philosophy\nof liberation was marked by internal tensions, which over time have\nbecome more intense, but that have also led to philosophical\ndevelopments that have taken the original theses to new levels of\nrefinement and theoretical elaboration. Cerutti Guldberg, who has\nwritten the most substantive and comprehensive study of liberation\nphilosophy, has offered a typology of the internal currents that names\nfour different currents (Cerutti Guldberg 1983, 1988\u20139, 2006).\nBeorlegui, writing more recently, argues that there are in fact six\ncurrents, though he accepts Cerutti Guldberg\u2019s four as being the\ncore and originating current (Beorlegui 2004: 695\u2013727). These\nfour currents will now be discussed sequentially.\n3.1 The Ontologicist\n\nThis current is generally associated with Mario Casalla, Carlos\nCullen, Gunther Rodolfo Kush, and Amelia Podetti. According to these\nthinkers, a Latin American philosophy of liberation has to begin from\nthe ontological situation of the American people, which has a distinct\nrelationship to being. This distinct relationship to being is\nexpressed in the two forms of the verb \u201cto be\u201d in Spanish:\nser (to be) and estar (to be in). Authentic Latin\nAmerican philosophy begins from the estar of the American\npeople in its own being. At the same time, everything that is either\nEuropean or North American has to be rejected as manifestations of a\nphilosophy of oppression and philosophical hegemony. This new\nphilosophy that breaks with the past and everything that is allegedly\nforeign must break with the \u201contological dependence\u201d that\nhas been suffered by Latin American in different ways. This current\nrejects as much European liberalism, as a form of abstract\nindividualism, and Marxism, as a form of economic and inorganic\ncollectivism. It calls for a form of populism that is neither\nnationalistic nor class oriented. Instead, \u201cel\npueblo\u201d is considered as an ontological entity, a community\nof fate, and organic unity that is a pure manifestation of a being-in\nthat assumes distinct cultural characteristics. This\n\u201cpueblo\u201d is not the nation, but the American\nmestizo and Amerindian. It is for this reason that Cerutti\nGuldberg also refers to this current as a manifestation of\n\u201canti-historicist populism\u201d (Cerutti Guldberg\n1988\u20139: 46).\n3.2 The Analectical\n\nThis current is associated with Enrique Dussel and Juan Carlos\nScannone. Like the ontologicist, the analectical also presents itself\nas a critique of both Eurocentrism and North American neo-colonialism.\nIt presents itself as a critique of modernity, conceived as a colonial\nand imperial ideology that has \u201cencubierto\u201d or\nconcealed what is distinctly Latin American. More generally, however,\nthe analectical current articulates itself as a metaphysical critique\nof the thinking of the totality, of all that is thought in terms of\nbeing, the whole that is postulated as the true. At the same time, it\nalso argues that philosophy must \u201cdepart\u201d or\n\u201clocate\u201d itself with reference to both a subject and\nobject of philosophizing. This subject and object is also\n\u201cel pueblo\u201d, or the people.\n\nIn contrast to the ontologicist position, however, the people is not\nunderstood ontologically, but metaphysically, or more precisely\nanalectically, (derived from \u201cana\u201d or beyond, in\ncontrast to \u201cdia\u201d or through and between). This\nstrand of the philosophy of liberation aims to overhaul all of\nphilosophy by subsuming all Western philosophy under the logic of the\nthinking of ontology and the dialectical totality that is always\nself-referential, from Aristotle and Plato, to Hegel, Marx and\nHabermas.\n\nFor philosophers in the analectical current, the authentic people is\nwhat is always outside the totality. Its form of being cannot be\ndetermined once and for all. It is at a given time, as it gives\nexpression to its quest for justice that has left its own legacy and\nmemory of struggle. However, its continuing quest for justice and the\nredress of past sufferings remain undetermined and unaccounted for. If\nfor the ontologicist current the role of the philosopher is to guide\nthe people to recognize its own deep and unsuspected wisdom, for the\nanalectical philosopher the role of philosopher is one that is focused\non being attentive to the clamoring, or \u201cinterpellations\u201d,\nof the people, so that he or she can give voice to their cry for\njustice. That said, it must also be noted that both Dussel and\nScannone have moved beyond many of these ideas, as they were first\nformulated in the early seventies (Dussel 1998, 2007; Scannone 1990).\nTo this extent the analectical denomination may be already\nanachronistic. While Scannone, remaining faithful to his Levinasian\nphilosophical commitments, has turned towards the development of\n\u201cinter-cultural philosophy\u201d, Dussel\u2019s critical\nengagement with Karl-Otto Apel and J\u00fcrgen Habermas has led him to\ndevelop a more dialectical philosophy of liberation, one which has\nmade the linguistic and pragmatic turn (Vallega 2014). Furthermore, in\ndialogue with Walter Mignolo and Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez, Dussel\nhas been arguing that the philosophy of liberation contributed and is\npart of the \u201cdecolonial turn\u201d in Latin American philosophy\n(see Castro-G\u00f3mez, 2011; Dussel 2015; Mignolo, 2011; Mignol and\nWalsh 2018; Mora\u00f1a, Dussel, J\u00e1uregi, eds. 2008; Allen\nand Mendieta, forthcoming).\n3.3 The Historicist\n\nThis current is associated with the work of Horacio Cerutti Guldberg,\nArturo Roig, Arturo Ardao, and Leopoldo Zea. Like the\n\u201cproblematizing\u201d current (see below), it presents itself\nas a critique of the two prior tendencies. These thinkers argue that\nit is neither possible nor desirable to set out from some absolute\nunsoiled and authentic point of departure. Instead, they argue that we\nare always already immersed in a history of ideas, and the task is\nthus to think the experience of Latin America from out its distinct\nhistory as it has been already thought. Indeed, a lot of the work the\nthinkers in this current have done is to engage in a rigorous\nreconstruction of the history of ideas in Latin America, to see their\nemergence out of unique process of social transformation, and their\ncontinued dialogue and confrontation across the decades and centuries.\nThis history of ideas in Latin America has also been presented as part\nof the project of political emancipation. It is for this reason that\nthe historical antecedents of Latin American philosophy cannot be\ndismissed, for they are also part of a history of the forging of\npolitical freedom in the subcontinent (Zea 1991).\n3.4 The Problematicizing\n\nThis current is associated with the work of Horacio Cerutti Guldberg,\nJos\u00e9 Severino Croatto, Manuel Ignacio Santos, and Gustavo\nOrtiz. Cerutti Guldberg has also argued that Salazar Body and Hugo\nAssmann ought to be considered as contributing to this current. For\nthis group of thinkers, the criteria of philosophy\u2019s efficacy or\nrelevance cannot be authenticity, or how it relates or departs from\nsome \u201cnull\u201d point of enunciation that either responds to\nor is an interpellation of some \u201cmacro\u201d subject. For this\ncurrent, the question is what could constitute a critical reflection,\nwithout fetishes or mystifications, on the demanding crises and\nchallenges of Latin American social reality. Unlike the ontologizing\nand the analectical currents, both the historicizing and the\nproblematicizing reject all ontological or metaphysical attempts to\nfix \u201cel pueblo\u201d or what is properly \u201cLo\nAmericano\u201d, (that is, what properly belong to the\n\u201cAmericas\u201d). Philosophy is caught in the river of history,\nit cannot jump out of, or pretend that a \u201crupture\u201d with\nthe past can be executed or proclaimed. For this group of thinkers,\nthe critical issues were twofold. First, how does philosophy respond\nto a specific set of historical challenges, without falling pray to\nthe ideological prejudices that condition that presentation of that\nvery historical? Second, what is the language that will allow that\nphilosophical reflection to remain ever vigilant?\n\nNotwithstanding these substantive and often time irreconcilable\ndifferences, the philosophy of liberation has been recognized as an\nextremely important and representative philosophical movement that\nsynthesized and responded to distinctly Latin American intellectual\ntraditions and historical challenges. In nearly half a century, other\nfigures have aligned themselves with the movement, even if they were\nnot part of the founding cohort.\n\nThis is the case with Franz Hinkelammert, who was born in Germany in\n1931, and was educated in the Free University in Berlin. In 1963, he\nemigrated to Latin America, first to Chile and then to Costa Rica,\nwhere along with Hugo Assmann, he funded the Departamento\nEcum\u00e9nico de Investigaciones (DEI). His original training was\nin economics, but over the last four decades he has produced a series\nof influential books dealing with the relationship between theology,\neconomics, and philosophy. His work takes up liberation theology, but\nfrom the perspective of political economy and aims to show that the\ntheology of liberation\u2019s critique of religious idolatry are\nmatched by Marxism\u2019s critique of the fetish of the commodity\nform and exploitation. Hinkelammert has also produced a series of\nmonographs aimed at the critique of neoliberalism. Still, what he has\ncontributed is what he calls the Cr\u00edtica de la raz\u00f3n\nut\u00f3pica (Critique of Utopian Reason) (1984), which is\noperative as much in Marxism as it is in liberalism. To counter\nunrealizable utopian projects, Hinkelammert introduced the principle\nof \u201cfactibilidad\u201d or feasibility, as criteria for\nthe evaluation of the ethicalness or morality of any transformative\nmoral-political project.\n\nAnother figure that has contributed to the further refinement of the\nphilosophy of philosophy, mostly through his students, is the Jesuit\ntheologian Ignacio Ellacur\u00eda, born in 1930 in Viscaya, Spain.\nHe was a student of Karl Rahner and Xavier Zubiri. He moved to El\nSalvador, to teach at the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), where he\nbecame rector in 1969, a position he led until 1989 when he was\nassassinated by paramilitary forces trained by the United States\nmilitary.\n\nEllacur\u00eda worked closely with the Spanish philosopher Zubiri,\nwhose work aimed to overcome the separation between epistemology and\nontology, knower and known, through the notion of what he called\n\u201csentient intelligence\u201d, or \u201cfeeling\nlogos\u201d. Ellacur\u00eda took up Zubiri\u2019s\nontological work and transformed it into a philosophy of history.\nReality is historical and thus it is dynamic. Dynamic historical\nreality is where subjects are formed, but they are also the ones that\nmake historical reality transformative because of their\npraxis, their practical engagement with the world. The\npraxis of human, however, is also always the expansion of the\nhorizon of action. Praxis gives rise to more possibilities\nfor engagement historical reality. The telos of\npraxis is thus greater liberty. His incomplete magnum\nopus Filosof\u00eda de la realidad hist\u00f3rica\n(1991) aimed to develop a philosophy of history that celebrated the\n\u201chistorical intelligence\u201d that is the sediment of praxical\nbeings taking charge of their historical reality that aims at greater\nliberty. It is to be noted that Ellacur\u00eda\u2019s philosophy of\nhistory and \u201cfeeling logos\u201d have been most\neffectively taken up in Dussel\u2019s most recent work on the ethics\nand politics of liberation, which is one reason that, as was noted\nabove, the \u201canalectical\u201d designator may no longer be a\nuseful denomination for a current that has been influenced so\nprofoundly by recent developments in Latin American philosophy (Dussel\n1998, 2007, 2009, 2017, 2018; Bautista 2014; Grant 2020; Mills\n2018).\n4. Themes and Debates\n\nPhilosophical currents have distinct profiles not only because of the\ntheses that define their methods and approaches, but also because of\nthe themes and problems that remain their preoccupations despite\nchanges and the incorporation of new methods and theses. The\nphilosophy of liberation has since its inception taken up the\nfollowing themes.\n\nThe question of populism. At the heart of the philosophy of\nliberation is the problem of the historical subject of liberation.\nThis problem has been addressed in terms of the idea of the\n\u201cpueblo\u201d or people. Yet, this has been defined in\na variety of ways: as an ethnocultural historical formation; as a\nsocio-economic entity; as a cultural entity that transcends both\nnations and classes; as what is to be forged through a democratic\npolitical project. The problem of what or who is the\n\u201cpeople\u201d has taken on a new urgency as new forms of\ndemocratic participation have emerged, and as Latin American nations\nfind themselves more integrated economically and politically due to\nhemispheric transformations. The political transformations of the last\ndecade throughout Latin America, away from revolutionary violence and\ntowards political participation, have been addressed in terms of the\nneed to rethink the issues of political representation and\nparticipation.\n\nThe question of the subject. This problem is the other side\nof the question about the historical subject of liberation. What is\nthe relationship between the individual subject, whether it be\nconceive as an epistemic or ethical agent, and their belonging to a\nmacro-historical subject, where this may be conceived as \u201cel\npueblo\u201d that is either a national-cultural unit, or a\ntransnational, cultural entity, such as the \u201cAmericas\u201d. As\na chapter in phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy, the philosophy\nliberation has addressed the nature of the particular and distinct\nembodied, free, historically located, and dependent subject. The\nembodied and historical situatedness of the agent is continuously\naddressed from the standpoint of the most deprived and most vulnerable\nin the collective historical subject that is always under\nquestion.\n\n The Question of Gender/Race. As in the liberation of\ntheology, the philosophy of liberation was initially slow to address\nthe questions of both gender and race, although the later was always a\ncentral theme of Latin American philosophy in general. The issue of\nrace was addressed in terms of mestizaje, blanqueamiento\n(whitening, i.e. the idea that through racial mixing Blacks would\nbecome White and thus assimilate into the broader society),\nindigenity, negritude, and racial mixing in general. Mestizaje,\nhowever, has tended to cover up the distinct role that race has played\nin the formation of Latin American identity. The question of gender,\nnonetheless, was explicitly addressed by Enrique Dussel as early as\n1977 in the third volume of his Filosof\u00eda Etica\nLatinoamericana (Dussel 1977), in which he developed an erotics of\nLatin American liberation. In 1980 Dussel published\nLiberaci\u00f3n de la Mujer y Er\u00f3tica Latinoamericana,\nwhich is made up of re-edition of the seventh chapter of this third\nvolume, along with a new text titled \u201cToward a Metaphysics of\nFeminity,\u201d which as the title suggests aims to offer a\nmetaphysical understanding of gender, in which woman is the\n\u201cOther\u201d of man. Dussel\u2019s metaphysics was critiqued\nfor being an anachronistic and \u201cmachista\u201d ontologization\nof Catholic, in particular, and Christian, more generally,\nunderstandings of sex and gender that negated the historical\ncontingency of gender roles that resulted in a recalcitrant rejection\nof sexual difference other than man/woman (Schutte 1993). In the\nepilogue to the 1994 edition of Liberaci\u00f3n de la Mujer y\nEr\u00f3tica Latinoamericana, Dussel, however, rejected and\ncritiqued his earlier views, noting that the Latin American feminism\nof the sixties was primarily oriented towards a critique of North\nAmerican feminism, and that the category of \u201cgender\u201d had\nnot yet being thoroughly absorbed and appropriated within Latin\nAmerican thinking. He also rejected the unintended\n\u201chomophobic\u201d dimension of his earlier call for an\n\u201cErotics\u201d of Latin American liberation. Over the last\nthree decades, in dialogue with Linda Alcoff, Lynda Lange, Maria\nLugones, Ofelia Schutte, and Elina Vuola (Alcoff and Mendieta, eds.\n2000), as well as theologians such as Maria Clara Bingemer,\n\u00a0Ivone Gebara, and Elsa Tamez, philosophers of liberation have\nbegan to address what Lugones has called \u201cthe coloniality of\ngender\u201d (Lugones 2010). \n\nThe question of utopia. As a philosophical movement defined\nby the quest for liberation, the philosophy of liberation has had to\nalways address the question of the role of utopia in energizing\nindividual and social movements. The question of utopia, however, is\nthe problem of the collective imaginary that projects goals that will\nguide transformative movements. Yet, at the same time, such\ntransformative imaginaries are criticized because of their lack of\nfeasibility or operability.\n\nThe question of history. The significance of history is a\nproblematic that threads the entire current and tradition of the\nphilosophy of liberation, not only because \u201cdependency\u201d\nand \u201cliberation\u201d are understood as historical issues, but\nbecause the very project of liberation is to be undertaken from within\nhistory. Indeed, even in its most \u201contological\u201d and\n\u201canalectical\u201d versions, the philosophy of liberation is\nalways addressing the historical character of human existence.\nCollectively, philosophers of liberation affirm that historical\nindexicality of freedom, that is, that human freedom cannot be\nunderstood in the abstract, but only against a very specific\nhistorical conditions that are material because they take the form of\nsocio-political institutions. For philosophers liberation, human\nliberty must be embodied and material precisely because it is part of\na dynamic historical reality.\n\nThe question of democracy and social order. The philosophy of\nliberation was defined as much by its resistance to all forms of\nauthoritarianism as by the persecution that many of its philosophers\nsuffered at the hands of dictators and authoritarian political\nfigures. In its early years question of democracy, legitimacy and\nlegality were subordinate to the metaphysical and ontological\nquestions of the subject of historical emancipation. However, over the\nlast two decades, the political future of Latin American has become a\nmore pressing issue. The quest for national sovereignty and liberation\nfrom Euroamerican imperialism is now framed in terms of ethnoracial\ndemocracies and the greater participation of sectors of the Latin\nAmerican people that were either excluded or entirely ignored during\nthe processes of national independence and national-state formation.\nIn the first decades of the twenty-first century, philosophers of\nliberation think of themselves as contributing to the elaboration of\nwhat has been called \u201cmulticultural\u201d democracy, and in\nthis way, more historically inflected and less\n\u201contological\u201d notions of \u201cel pueblo\u201d\nare being embraced and developed.\n\nTo close, like most vibrant and still alive currents in world\nphilosophy, the philosophy of liberation has been contributing to\nthree key issues that are vital to all philosophy in general, namely:\nthe question of meaning, i.e., how we produce, reproduce and transmit\nhistorically produced meanings across a variety of semiological and\nhermeneutical practices. This is the general question of how humans\ncontinue to communicate across time, even when their basic conditions\nof the production of world-views has radically altered. In tandem, the\nphilosophy of liberation, which began partly as a challenge to a\ncertain historiography of ideas in Latin America, continues to raise\nthe question of how we write the history of philosophy, for whom and\nfor what purposes, in such a way that we surrender to neither\nideological distortions nor na\u00efve purisms, neither Eurocentrism\nnor thirdworldism. Finally, like all transformative and enduring\nphilosophical movements, the philosophy of liberation has since its\ninception articulated itself as a metaphilosophical reflection, i.e.,\nas a philosophy that reflects on its own practice and what merits the\ndignity of being called philosophy tout court (Vallega\n2014).\n",
