    "main_text": "Eliminating Alternative Explanations || Null Hypotheses in Comparative Cognition\n2.1 Null Hypotheses in Comparative Cognition\n\nA central element of experimental work in the sciences involves\ncontrolling for extraneous or \u201cnuisance\u201d variables.\nComparative cognition is like other sciences in employing experimental\nand statistical methods to control for such variables (Bausman &\nHalina 2018; Dacey 2023). The aim of an experiment is generally to\ndetermine whether there is a relationship between the independent and\ndependent variables. For example, crows drop nuts onto roads and\nretrieve the cracked nuts (Shettleworth 2010a). Are they doing this\nbecause they\u2019ve learned that cars can be used as\n\u201cnutcrackers\u201d? Or has the behavior of dropping nuts from a\nheight evolved over many generations (perhaps before the advent of\ncars)? As a first step towards answering these questions, one might\nexperimentally investigate whether the presence of approaching cars on\na road (the independent variable) affects nut-dropping behavior in\ncrows (the dependent variable) (Cristol et al. 1997). To detect this\neffect, however, one must control for the \u201cnoise\u201d created\nby extraneous variables\u2014i.e., those variables that are also\nlikely to affect the dependent variable. In the case of foraging\ncrows, extraneous variables may include time of day, season, proximity\nto nut trees, etc. In an experiment, the statistical null hypothesis\ntypically holds that any differences observed in the dependent\nvariable can be attributed to extraneous variables and thus there is\nno evidence that the independent variable has had an effect (see Sani\n& Todman 2006). Whether an observed difference in the dependent\nvariable can be attributed to the independent variable (i.e., whether\nthe difference is statistically significant) depends on one\u2019s\ntest statistic, which reflects the variability of the data due to\nknown extraneous variables. If proximity to nut trees can explain the\ndifference observed in nut-dropping behavior, for example, then there\nis insufficient evidence to conclude that nut-dropping behavior has\nbeen affected by the presence or absence of approaching cars.\n\nThe term \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d is sometimes used more broadly\nto refer to an alternative or competing hypothesis, rather than a\nstatistical null hypothesis. For example, associative learning,\nbehavior reading, and hypotheses that deny animals\n\u201cspecial\u201d human-like cognitive abilities are often\nreferred to as \u201cnull hypotheses\u201d (see Hanus 2016;\nDickinson 2012; Andrews & Huss 2014; Mikhalevich 2015). These\nhypotheses are typically contrasted with those that attribute complex\nor human-like cognitive abilities to animals like causal reasoning or\ntheory of mind. One problem with this broad use is that the term\n\u201cnull\u201d suggests that a hypothesis should be epistemically\nprivileged (in the sense that it must be rejected before accepting any\nalternative hypothesis) when in many of these cases it is not clear\nthe purported null should be privileged in this way. As Andrews and\nHuss (2014) write:\n\n\nthe onus is on the skeptic to explain why the skeptical hypothesis and\nnot the optimistic hypothesis that animals do have psychological\nproperties is the proper null hypothesis. (2014: 720\u2013721)\n\n\nStatistical null hypotheses are epistemically privileged in the sense\nthat they must be rejected before one can conclude that the variable\nof interest (the independent variable) has had an effect. This\ninference strategy is justified in the context of statistical\nhypothesis testing due to the nature of experimental design and\ninferential statistics (Bausman & Halina 2018). However, the\nfeatures that justify this strategy in the statistical case are not\npresent in hypothesis evaluation more generally (the latter lacks a\ntest statistic, for example). Instead, one must supply compelling\nreasons for preferring one hypothesis (such as associative learning)\nover another (such as causal reasoning). Such reasons may be\ntheoretical (e.g., that one hypothesis has epistemic virtues like\npredictive power that the other lacks) or empirical (e.g., that one\nhypothesis already has independent empirical support, while the other\ndoes not). The next three sections discuss hypothesis evaluation in\ncomparative cognition in this broader sense.
