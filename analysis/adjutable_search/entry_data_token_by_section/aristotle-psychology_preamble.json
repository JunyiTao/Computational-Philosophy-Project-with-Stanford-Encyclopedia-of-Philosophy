    "main_text": "\n\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BC) was born in Macedon, in what is now northern\nGreece, but spent most of his adult life in Athens. His life in Athens\ndivides into two periods, first as a member of Plato\u2019s Academy\n(367\u2013347) and later as director of his own school, the Lyceum\n(334\u2013323). The intervening years were spent mainly in Assos and Lesbos,\nand briefly back in Macedon. His years away from Athens were\npredominantly taken up with biological research and writing. Judged on\nthe basis of their content, Aristotle\u2019s most important psychological\nwritings probably belong to his second residence in Athens, and so to\nhis most mature period. His principal work in psychology, De\nAnima, reflects in different ways his pervasive interest in\nbiological taxonomy and his most sophisticated physical and\nmetaphysical theory.\n\n\nBecause of the long tradition of exposition which has developed\naround Aristotle\u2019s De Anima, the interpretation of even its\nmost central theses is sometimes disputed. Moreover, because of its\nevident affinities with some prominent approaches in contemporary\nphilosophy of mind, Aristotle\u2019s psychology has received renewed\ninterest and has incited intense interpretative dispute in recent\ndecades. Consequently, this entry proceeds on two levels. The main\narticle recounts the principal and distinctive claims of Aristotle\u2019s\npsychology, avoiding so far as possible exegetical controversy and\ncritical commentary. At the end of appropriate sections of the main\narticle, readers are invited to explore problematic or advanced\nfeatures of Aristotle\u2019s theories by following the appropriate\nlinks.\n",
