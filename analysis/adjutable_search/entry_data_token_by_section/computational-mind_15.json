    "main_text": "Alternative conceptions of computation || Information-processing\n6.1 Information-processing\nIt is common for cognitive scientists to describe computation as\n\u201cinformation-processing\u201d. It is less common for proponents\nto clarify what they mean by \u201cinformation\u201d or\n\u201cprocessing\u201d. Lacking clarification, the description is\nlittle more than an empty slogan.\nClaude Shannon introduced a scientifically important notion of\n\u201cinformation\u201d in his 1948 article \u201cA Mathematical\nTheory of Communication\u201d. The intuitive idea is that information\nmeasures reduction in uncertainty, where reduced uncertainty\nmanifests as an altered probability distribution over possible states.\nShannon codified this idea within a rigorous mathematical framework,\nlaying the foundation for information theory (Cover and\nThomas 2006). Shannon information is fundamental to modern\nengineering. It finds fruitful application within cognitive science,\nespecially cognitive neuroscience. Does it support a convincing\nanalysis of computation as \u201cinformation-processing\u201d?\nConsider an old-fashioned tape machine that records messages received\nover a wireless radio. Using Shannon\u2019s framework, one can\nmeasure how much information is carried by some recorded\nmessage. There is a sense in which the tape machine\n\u201cprocesses\u201d Shannon information whenever we replay a\nrecorded message. Still, the machine does not seem to implement a\nnon-trivial computational \nmodel.[6]\n Certainly, neither the Turing machine\nformalism nor the neural network formalism offers much insight into\nthe machine\u2019s operations. Arguably, then, a system can process\nShannon information without executing computations in any interesting\nsense.\nConfronted with such examples, one might try to isolate a more\ndemanding notion of \u201cprocessing\u201d, so that the tape machine\ndoes not \u201cprocess\u201d Shannon information. Alternatively, one\nmight insist that the tape machine executes non-trivial computations.\nPiccinini and Scarantino (2010) advance a highly general notion of\ncomputation\u2014which they dub generic\ncomputation\u2014with that consequence.\n A second prominent notion of information derives from Paul\nGrice\u2019s (1989) influential discussion of natural\nmeaning. Natural meaning involves reliable,\ncounterfactual-supporting correlations. For example, tree rings\ncorrelate with the age of the tree, and pox correlate with\nchickenpox. We colloquially describe tree rings as carrying\ninformation about tree age, pox as carrying information about\nchickenpox, and so on. Such descriptions suggest a conception that\nties information to reliable, counterfactual-supporting\ncorrelations. Fred Dretske (1981) develops this conception into a\nsystematic theory, as do various subsequent philosophers. Does\nDretske-style information subserve a plausible analysis of computation\nas \u201cinformation-processing\u201d? Consider an\nold-fashioned bimetallic strip thermostat. Two metals are\njoined together into a strip. Differential expansion of the metals\ncauses the strip to bend, thereby activating or deactivating a heating\nunit. Strip state reliably correlates with current ambient\ntemperature, and the thermostat \u201cprocesses\u201d this\ninformation-bearing state when activating or deactivating the\nheater. Yet the thermostat does not seem to implement any non-trivial\ncomputational model. One would not ordinarily regard the thermostat as\ncomputing. Arguably, then, a system can process Dretske-style\ninformation without executing computations in any interesting\nsense. Of course, one might try to handle such examples through\nmaneuvers parallel to those from the previous paragraph.\nA third prominent notion of information is semantic\ninformation, i.e., representational\ncontent.[7] Some\nphilosophers hold that a physical system computes only if the\nsystem\u2019s states have representational properties (Dietrich 1989;\nFodor 1998: 10; Ladyman 2009; Shagrir 2006; Sprevak 2010). In that\nsense, information-processing is necessary for\ncomputation. As Fodor memorably puts it, \u201cno computation without\nrepresentation\u201d (1975: 34). However, this position is\ndebatable. Chalmers (2011) and Piccinini (2008a) contend that a Turing\nmachine might execute computations even though symbols manipulated by\nthe machine have no semantic interpretation. The machine\u2019s\ncomputations are purely syntactic in nature, lacking anything like\nsemantic properties. On this view, representational content is not\nnecessary for a physical system to count as computational.\nIt remains unclear whether the slogan \u201ccomputation is\ninformation-processing\u201d provides much insight. Nevertheless, the\nslogan seems unlikely to disappear from the literature anytime soon.\nFor further discussion of possible connections between computation and\ninformation, see Gallistel and King (2009: 1\u201326), Lizier,\nFlecker, and Williams (2013), Milkowski (2013), Piccinini and\nScarantino (2010), and Sprevak (forthcoming).\n",
