    "main_text": "Applications\n8. Applications\n\nThe fourth challenge concerns applications.\n \u00a72\n mentioned that deductivism appears to provide a straightforward\naccount of the applicability of mathematics: provided a physical\nsystem satisfies the axioms of a particular branch of mathematics, the\nbranch\u2019s theorems must apply to the physical system. But what\nexactly does it mean for a system to satisfy an axiom? The simplest\naccount of applications is the mapping or isomorphism account. Given a\nphysical set-up \\(P\\), stipulate an isomorphism from \\(P\\) to some\nmathematical structure \\(M\\), deduce some facts about \\(M\\), and then,\napplying the isomorphism in the reverse direction, read off the\ncorresponding facts about \\(P\\). Resnik (1980, 125), following Russell\nand Putnam, worries that this account is knee-deep in\nmathematics\u2014for what is an isomorphism if not a mathematical\nobject? More generally, a satisfactory account of mathematical\napplications will have to employ mathematics to explain how\nmathematics relates to the physical\n world.[16]\n\nThis is a major concern that applies to a host of other philosophies.\nAll anti-platonists must set out how to understand the mathematics\nitself used to explain the applicability of mathematics. Eliminative\nstructuralists must give an account of the mathematics relating\nstructures to the physical world. Nominalists must likewise explain\nhow scientific theories laden with commitment to abstract objects can\ncorrectly depict the physical facts despite there being no abstract\nobjects. Each specific anti-platonism seems to face some version of\nthis general problem. Allowing the use of mathematics in the\nmetatheory enables a philosophy to relate mathematics and the natural\nworld; disallowing it appears to hamstring a philosophy\u2014or so\nthis challenge maintains.\n\nSo can the deductivist explain mathematics\u2019 applicability?\nPerhaps her best hope of doing so is by means of a combined\nmathematical-scientific \u201ctotal\u201d theory, which we may call\nTT. TT incorporates all the axioms of mathematics,\nas well as established scientific principles and data. Through its\ncombination of mathematics and science, TT is able to posit\nall sorts of relations between mathematical \u201cstructures\u201d\nand physical situations and thereby explain mathematical applications\n(at least as well as anyone can). The truth-conditions of physical\nclaims derivable from TT should be understood in the usual\nreferential manner, as relating to the physical world; whereas the\ntruth-conditions of mathematical claims should, for the deductivist,\nbe understood as above, namely as claims of the form \u201c\\(p\\) is\ndeducible from TT\u201d. Importantly, for the deductivist,\n\u201cstructures\u201d and \u201cisomorphisms\u201d are to be\nunderstood deductively within the theory TT. Effectively, the\ndeductivist internalises model theory into the deductive\nframework.\n\nThis response looks like it dispatches the challenge from\napplications. Mathematics and science can be discussed and compared\nwithin the single overarching theory, TT. However, the\nresponse has an Achilles heel: mixed statements. The deductivist\nconstrues talk of numbers in deductivist fashion and talk of chairs\n(say) in straightforwardly literal fashion. So what is she to make of\na claim such as \u201cMy favourite things are the number 7 and this\nchair\u201d? The claim cannot be read literally, as it involves\nreference to a number; nor should it be read in deductivist fashion,\nsince it involves reference to a concrete entity, a particular chair.\nThat a chair is one of my favourite things is a claim with empirical\ncontent, to be taken literally. The sentence \u201cmy favourite\nthings are the number 7 and this chair\u201d is of course a toy\nexample. The point applies much more widely, since mathematics is\nseamlessly interwoven with ordinary and (especially) scientific\nlanguage.\n\nThe deductivist therefore owes us a recipe for cleaving the\nmathematical from the non-mathematical in all mixed statements. This\nis a problem faced by other anti-platonist approaches, for example by\nfictionalists about mathematics such as Mary\n Leng.[17]\n They take applied mathematics to be an \u201cextended fiction\u201d\nthat combines the (alleged) fiction of mathematics with science, which\nthey construe literally (as it is about the physical world). But which\nis which, where do we draw the line, and how do we deal with\nstatements mixing fiction and the literal, apparently inextricably?\nFinding good answers to the corresponding questions is a significant\nchallenge for deductivists just as much as it is for\nfictionalists.\n",
