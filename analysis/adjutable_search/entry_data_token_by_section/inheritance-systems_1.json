    "main_text": "Introduction || Early Work On Non-Genetic Inheritance\n1.2 Early Work On Non-Genetic Inheritance\n\nModern evolutionary theory equates inheritance with the transmission\nof genes from parents to offspring and as such focuses only on genetic\ninheritance (which will be further described in section 3.3.1).\nNevertheless, biologists have long known of patterns of inheritance,\nand eventually of inheritance mechanisms, that go beyond genetic\ninheritance (Jablonka & Lamb 2005; Sapp 1987). Two fundamental\ntypes of arguments led to this conclusion: arguments based on\nobservations regarding patterns of inheritance, and arguments\nconcerned with the localization of hereditary factors inside cells.\nArguments of the first kind were based on hereditary relations and\ninheritance patterns that fail to conform to the rules of Mendelian\ninheritance (e.g., maternal inheritance). If Mendelian inheritance\npatterns are the result of the way the chromosomes in the eukaryotic\ncell nucleus behave, non-Mendelian heredity must depend on separate\ninheritance processes, mechanisms, or systems (Beale 1966; Sager\n1966). Second, there were observations of hereditary phenomena that\nseemed to depend on factors residing in the cytoplasm of cells, rather\nthan their nucleus, where the genetic material is localized. The\ninterpretation of these observations was highly contested (Darlington\n1944; Sapp 1987).\n\nToday, we know that some of these observations are related to the\n(maternal) inheritance of organelles residing in the cytoplasm, such\nas the mitochondria and chloroplasts, organelles which carry their own\nDNA. This however does not encompass all the mechanisms which underlie\ncytoplasmatic inheritance. Paradigmatic work on cytoplasmatic\ninheritance done by Sonneborn, Beale, Nanney, and their colleagues in\nthe 1950s and 1960s, was concerned with patterns of inheritance in\nunicellular organisms, and in particular the protist genus\nParamecium. It was suggested that the self-sustaining\nregulatory loops that maintain gene activity or inactivity in a cell\nwould persist through cell division, provided the non-DNA components\nof the system (many of which reside in the cytoplasm in eukaryotic\nmicroogranisms) were shared among daughter cells. In this way,\nalternative regulatory phenotypic states would be inherited. Among the\nproperties whose inheritance was studied were mating-type variations,\nserotype variations, and the structural or \u201csurface\ninheritance\u201d of ciliary structures. Remarkably, microsurgical\nchanges to the ciliary structures on the surface of\nParamecium cells are inherited by offspring. The stability of\ninduced characters once the stimulus was removed (called\n\u201ccellular memory\u201d) and the number of generations\ncharacters were maintained varied widely. However, the results\nindicated that long-term stability and heritability need not be the\nresult of changes to the DNA sequence (Nanney 1958).\n\nDuring the 1950s to 1970s a growing set of observations indicated that\ndetermined and differentiated states of cells are transmitted in cell\nlineages. These observations concerned studies of Drosophila imaginal\ndiscs by Ernst Hadorn; Briggs and King\u2019s cloning experiments\nwith amphibians; Mary Lyon\u2019s work on X-chromosome inactivation;\nand work establishing the in vitro clonal stability of\ncultured cell lines. Eventually, the term epigenetic\ninheritance came to refer to hereditary variation that does not\ninvolve changes to the DNA sequence.\n\nThe brief account of some of the early work on unicellular organisms\ngiven above illustrates some of the distinctions that are elaborated\nin the rest of this entry. One group of questions is concerned with\nthe properties of hereditary relations, the sources of variations (in\nparticular, whether they can be environmentally induced), the\nstability of variations and their regulation, and so on. A second\nclass of questions is concerned with the way hereditary information is\nstored and transmitted. It is here that we can locate the debates\nabout nuclear versus cytoplasmatic inheritance and about the primacy\nof DNA as the information store of the cell. Although the distinction\nbetween these two groups of questions is useful, many of the topics\nand controversies to be discussed in this entry involve both.\n",
