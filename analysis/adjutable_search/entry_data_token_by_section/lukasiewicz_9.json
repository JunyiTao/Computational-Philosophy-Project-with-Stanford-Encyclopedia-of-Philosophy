In 1931 Wajsberg\naxiomatized the three-valued system \u0141\\(_3\\)\nby the theses \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& CpCqp \\\\\n & CCpqCCqrCpr \\\\\n & CCNpNqCqp \\\\\n & CCCpNppp \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nWajsberg also proved a conjecture of \u0141ukasiewicz that the\ndenumerably infinite-valued system \u0141\\(_{\\aleph_0}\\)\ncan be axiomatized by\n\n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& CpCqp \\\\\n & CCpqCCqrCpr \\\\\n & CCCpqqCCqpp \\\\\n & CCCpqCqpCqp \\\\\n & CCNpNqCqp \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nNone of these systems is functionally complete: there are connectives\nnot definable on the basis of C and N alone. Among\nthose that are definable is possibility M: as early as 1921\nTarski showed that it could be defined as CNpp. In 1936\nS\u0142upecki showed that by adding a functor \\(T\\) specifiable as\n\\(\\tval{Tp} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\) for all values of p, all\nconnectives can be defined in \u01413. To axiomatize these\nfunctionally complete system the formulas \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& CTpNTp \\\\\n & CNTpTp \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nhave to be added to Wajsberg\u2019s axioms.\n\nAdolf Lindenbaum showed that \u0141\\(_n\\) is\ncontained in \u0141\\(_m\\) \\((n \\lt m)\\) if and\nonly if \\(n - 1\\) is a divisor of \\(m - 1\\), so if neither divides the\nother their respective tautologies properly overlap but neither set is\ncontained in the other. Tautologies of the infinite-valued system\n\u0141\\(_{\\aleph_0}\\) are contained in those\nof all the finite-valued systems.\n",
