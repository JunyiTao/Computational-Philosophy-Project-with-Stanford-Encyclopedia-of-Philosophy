    "main_text": "Divine Inspiration || Phaedrus\n3.2 Phaedrus\n\nWhen introducing the Phaedrus\u2019s major speech on\ner\u00f4s (244a\u2013250d), Socrates defines desirous love\nas a species of mania, madness, in a context that comments on\nphilosophy and poetry with an aside about mim\u00easis a few\npages later. Although other sections of the Phaedrus are\nrelevant to Platonic aesthetics, this is the only part directly about\ninspiration.\n\nSocrates\u2019 speech begins by sorting out mania. Madness comes\nin two general forms: the diseased state of mental dysfunction, and a\ndivergence from ordinary rationality that a god sometimes brings (see\n265a\u2013b). Divine madness subdivides into love, Dionysian frenzy,\noracular prophecy, and poetic composition (244b\u2013245a). In all\nfour cases the possessed or inspired person\n(enthousiaz\u00f4n: 241e, 249e, 253a, 263d) can accomplish\nwhat is impossible for someone in a sane state. All four cases are\nassociated with particular deities and traditionally honored.\n\nOn reconciling the possession described in the Ion with that\nin the Phaedrus, see Gonzalez 2011 for extended discussion.\nIn abbreviated terms we can say that the madness of the\nPhaedrus is separated from ordinary madness as the\nIon\u2019s version is not, and is classified pointedly as\ngood derangement. Being a god, Eros can\u2019t do anything bad\n(242d\u2013e). The greatest blessings flow from divine mania\n(244a). \n\nNor is this possessed condition associated with idiosyncrasy in the\nPhaedrus. On the contrary. To account for the madness of love\nSocrates describes an otherworldly existence in which souls ride\nacross the top of heaven enjoying direct visions of the Forms\n(247c\u2013d). After falling into bodily existence a soul responds to\nbeauty more avidly than it does to any other qualities for which there\nare Forms.\n\nAssociating beauty with inspiration suggests that poetry born of\n(another kind of) inspiration might also have philosophical worth. But\nbefore welcoming the lost sheep Plato back to the poetry-loving fold,\nrecognize the Phaedrus\u2019s qualifying remarks about which\npoetry one may now prize. It cannot be imitative. When Socrates ranks\nhuman souls depending on how much otherworldly being they saw before\nfalling into bodily form\u2014philosophers come in first on this\nranking\u2014the poet or other mim\u00eatikos occupies\nsixth place out of nine (248e).\n\nIndeed the argument of the Phaedrus only identifies a single\ntype of poem that the Muses call forth: the poem that\n\u201cembellishes thousands of deeds of the ancients to educate\n[paideuei] later generations\u201d (245a). But Plato exempts\nhymns to gods and encomia of heroes from even his harshest\ncondemnation of poetry (Republic 607a). Quite compatibly with\nthe Republic\u2019s exemption the Ion specifies a hymn to\nthe Muses as its example of inspiration and the Phaedrus\ndescribes the praise of heroes. Whenever possible Plato reserves the\nbenefits of inspiration for the poems he does not have reason to\ncondemn. And this restriction on which poems derive a true merit from\nbeing inspired leaves inspiration a long way from guaranteeing\npoetry\u2019s value.\n",
