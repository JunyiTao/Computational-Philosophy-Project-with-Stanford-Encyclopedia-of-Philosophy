    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n2. Aesthetics\n\nAn aesthetic judgment, in Kant\u2019s usage, is a judgment which is\nbased on feeling, and in particular on the feeling of pleasure or\ndispleasure. According to Kant\u2019s official view there are three\nkinds of aesthetic judgment: judgments of the agreeable, judgments of\nbeauty (or, equivalently, judgments of taste), and judgments of the\nsublime. However, Kant often uses the expression \u201caesthetic\njudgment\u201d in a narrower sense which excludes judgments of the\nagreeable, and it is with aesthetic judgments in this narrower sense\nthat the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d is primarily\nconcerned. Such judgments can either be, or fail to be,\n\u201cpure\u201d; while Kant mostly focusses on the ones which are\npure, there are reasons to think that most judgments about art (as\nopposed to nature) do not count as pure, so that it is important to\nunderstand Kant\u2019s views on such judgments as well.\n\nThe \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d is concerned not only\nwith judgments of the beautiful and the sublime, but also with the\nproduction of objects about which such judgments are appropriately\nmade; this topic is discussed under the headings of \u201cfine\nart\u201d or \u201cbeautiful art\u201d [sch\u00f6ne Kunst]\nand \u201cgenius\u201d.\n\nThe most distinctive part of Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory, and the\npart which has aroused most interest among commentators, is his\naccount of judgments of beauty, and, more specifically, pure judgments\nof beauty. (Following Kant\u2019s own usage, the expression\n\u201cjudgment of beauty\u201d without qualification will refer, in\nwhat follows, to pure judgments of beauty.) The most important\nelements of this account are sketched here in\n Section 2.1\n and\n Section 2.2,\n and which correspond roughly to the \u201cAnalytic of the\nBeautiful\u201d and the \u201cDeduction of Pure Aesthetic\nJudgments\u201d respectively.\n Section 2.3\n and\n Section 2.4\n are concerned, respectively, with interpretative issues that have\narisen in connection with the account, and with criticisms which have\nbeen made of it.\n\nOther elements of Kant\u2019s theory are sketched in the remainder of\nthe section. Section 2.5 is concerned with judgments of beauty that\nare not pure, in particular judgments of \u201cadherent\u201d as\nopposed to \u201cfree\u201d beauty;\n Section 2.6\n with beautiful art and genius;\n Section 2.7\n with judgments of the sublime;\n Section 2.8\n with the relation between aesthetics and morality; and\n Section 2.9\n with other implications of Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory.\n",
