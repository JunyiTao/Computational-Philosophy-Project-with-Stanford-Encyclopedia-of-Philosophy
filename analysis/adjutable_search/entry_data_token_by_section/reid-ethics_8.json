    "main_text": "The Moral Sense || Reid\u2019s view compared with Hutcheson\u2019s\n4.1 Reid\u2019s view compared with Hutcheson\u2019s\n\nThose familiar with Reid\u2019s writing on perception will\nimmediately notice rather striking similarities between\nHutcheson\u2019s account of the moral sense and Reid\u2019s account\nof external sense. To see this, consider a case of ordinary tactile\nperception, such as when one perceives that the table before one is\nhard by touching it. In cases such as these, how do we perceive the\ntable\u2019s hardness? According to Reid, in such cases, it is\npressure sensations\u2014which, Reid stresses, largely go unnoticed\nand unnamed\u2014that immediately produce in us a \u201cconception\nand belief\u201d of the table that it is hard. As such, Reid says,\nthe best explanation of how we perceive things such as a table\u2019s\nhardness is that the \u201cAuthor of our Nature\u201d has designed\nus in such a way that, when all goes well, feelings of a certain range\nfunction as signs or indicators of it. (God, Reid emphasizes, could\nhave easily fashioned us in such a way that the perceptual process\nworked differently. For all we reasonably believe, God could have\nconstructed us in such a way that signs of an entirely different sort,\nsuch as noises or smells of a certain range, indicate a table\u2019s\nhardness.) Reid stresses that, according to this account of\nperception, pressure sensations are not ideas in the sense that Locke\nor Hume thought of them. For pressure sensations do not function as\nintermediaries of which we are aware that imagistically represent the\ntable\u2019s hardness and from which we infer its existence.\n\nIn order to explain judgments of these sorts, then, both Hutcheson and\nReid appeal not to reason but to an indigenous sense with which we\ncome hardwired. Both thinkers maintain that (in the ordinary case)\ninference plays no role in the production of such\njudgments\u2014feelings being such as to immediately evoke them.\nBoth, moreover, offer thoroughly teleological accounts of perception,\nwhich appeal to the plan of the \u201cAuthor of our nature.\u201d\nAnd, finally, both champion semiotic accounts of perceptual judgment\nformation. According to the relevant design plans, sensations or\nfeelings of various kinds play the role of being signs for or\nindicators of qualities of things in the world.\n\nAt various points, Reid himself highlights the similarities between\nthe two senses (see EAP III.iii.vi: 179\u201380 and PE, 144). Having\nnoted these similarities, however, Reid goes on to claim that there is\nalso an important disanalogy between the judgments produced by\nexternal sense, on the one hand, and the moral sense, on the other: In\nthe former case, when all goes well, feelings elicit judgments about\nthe external world. In the latter case, the order of explanation is\nreversed: \u201cIn the approbation of a good action \u2026 there is\nfeeling indeed, but there is also esteem of the agent; and both the\nfeeling and the esteem depend upon the judgment we form of his\nconduct,\u201d not vice-versa (EAP V.vii: 349; for discussion, see\nBroadie 1998 and Cuneo 2006). By stressing that states of approbation\nare not mere feelings but include full-blooded moral judgments, Reid\ntakes himself to have corrected a deficiency in Hutcheson\u2019s\nview. For while Hutcheson nowhere denies that the outputs of the moral\nsense include the acceptance of moral propositions neither does he\naffirm this. Rather, what Hutcheson tells us is that states of\napprobation are feelings of pleasure and that they yield\n\u201clove\u201d for the benevolent. But Hutcheson, Reid points out,\nsays next to nothing about this latter state, never specifying whether\nit includes moral propositional content. By explicitly specifying that\nthe outputs of the moral sense have moral propositional\ncontent\u2014indeed, a wide range of such contents\u2014Reid takes\nhimself to have identified more accurately the character of its\noutputs.\n\nLet us pull these strands of argument together. Both Hutcheson and\nReid, we\u2019ve seen, maintain that we come equipped with a moral\nsense that bears certain resemblances to external sense. The Reidian\nmoral sense differs in two important respects, however, from the\nHutchesonian one. First, the outputs of the Reidian moral sense\ninclude not only moral conceptions, but also full-blooded moral\nbeliefs with moral propositional content. (Reid, incidentally,\nunderstood Hume to deny that moral judgments have moral propositional\ncontent; for his attack on this view, see EAP V.vii and Cuneo 2004).\nThese moral beliefs themselves concern not only general moral truths,\nsuch as the moral first principles, but also particular ones, such as\nthat this particular person\u2019s behavior merits approbation.\n\nSecond, we have seen that Reid reverses the order of explanation\nbetween sentiment and moral judgment. In the paradigmatic case, moral\njudgments elicit moral sentiments, not vice-versa. Although Reid\nreverses Hutcheson\u2019s order of explanation claim, he still thinks\nof a range of particular moral judgments as being cases of moral\nperception. His basic approach is to claim that, in moral perception,\nit is not sentiments that function as signs of moral properties.\nRather, it is the behavior and countenance of agents that play this\nrole. Roughly, the guiding idea is that moral properties of a certain\nrange attach to the mental states of agents such as their beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions. For example, the property being kind\ncan attach to an agent\u2019s intention to perform a certain act.\nThese mental states and their properties manifest themselves in the\nbehavior and countenance of agents. Ordinary mature agents are so\nconstituted that, when all goes well, upon becoming aware of the\nbehavior and countenance of these agents, this awareness\nnon-inferentially evokes in us the conception and belief of those\nagents that they have properties such as being kind,\ndeceitful, faithful, and so forth. In this regard,\nmoral perception exhibits the same fundamental structure as our\nperception of what Reid calls visible figure, such as an\nobject\u2019s length and height (see Cuneo 2003, 2006, Kroeker 2010,\nCopenhaver 2014). In both cases, features of our environment function\nas signs for a given quality, these signs being such as to\nnon-inferentially produce conception and belief. Here is how Reid\nhimself puts the point:\n\n\nIntelligence, design, and skill, are not objects of the external\nsenses, nor can we be conscious of them in any person but\nourselves\u2026.\n\nA man\u2019s wisdom is known to us only by the signs of it in his\nconduct; his eloquence by the signs of it in his speech. In the same\nmanner we judge of his virtue, of his fortitude, and of all his\ntalents and qualities of mind.\n\nYet it is to be observed, that we judge of men\u2019s talents with as\nlittle doubt or hesitation as we judge of the immediate objects of\nsense.\n\n\u2026 We perceive one man to be open, another cunning; one to be\nignorant, another very knowing; one to be slow of understanding,\nanother quick. Every man forms such judgments of those he converses\nwith; and the common affairs of life depend upon such judgments. We\ncan as little avoid them as we can avoid seeing what is before our\neyes.\n\nFrom this it appears, that it is no less part of the human\nconstitution, to judge of men\u2019s characters, and of their\nintellectual powers, from the signs of them in their actions and\ndiscourse, than to judge of corporeal objects by our senses. (EIP\nVI.vi: 503\u20134)\n\n\nIt is Reid\u2019s view, then, that we can apprehend both the external\nworld and moral reality. He also holds that the beliefs formed on the\nbasis of these apprehensions are generally in good epistemic order.\nSo, in the case of our perception of external objects, Reid rejects\nskepticism. Admittedly, Reid says, we may lack a complete explanation\nof how we become aware of external reality. But this, says Reid, is no\nreason to doubt that we can in fact apprehend it.\n\nIn fact, Reid claims, there are powerful reasons to reject skepticism\nabout external sense. For consider our indigenous or\n\u201coriginal\u201d epistemic faculties such as memory,\nintrospection, reasoning, and perception. The outputs of these\nfaculties include judgments of various sorts\u2014judgments about\nwhat happened, what one is feeling, what to conclude given one\u2019s\nevidence, and so forth. The practices of forming these judgments are\nsocially well-established over time. Indeed, they are so deeply\nentrenched that engaging in them is, for all practical purposes,\ninescapable; we cannot avoid forming memory judgments, introspective\njudgments, perceptual judgments, and so forth. Moreover, we have\nsophisticated methods of evaluating judgments made in these domains,\nincluding ways of checking their reliability and the appeal to experts\nof various sorts. Finally, many of the judgments made in these domains\nare not subject to systemic disagreement among competent participants.\nBy and large, our judgments about the external world, for example,\nconverge.\n\nShould we trust the deliverance of indigenous faculties of this sort?\nIn one of his better known dialectal maneuvers, Reid claims that we\nshould. For, Reid says, our situation is this. If we didn\u2019t\ntrust any of our indigenous faculties, we would face wholesale\nskepticism. Our most basic processes of reasoning would be rationally\nundercut, for we could not trust their deliverances. If we trust only\nsome but not all of our original faculties, then Reid claims we are\nbeing arbitrarily partial. Given that these faculties exhibit similar\nfeatures, what reason could we have\u2014at least at the outset of\ntheorizing\u2014for trusting one but not the other? In a well-known\npassage, Reid puts the point like this:\n\nReason, says the sceptic, is the only judge of truth, and you ought to\nthrow off every opinion and every belief that is not grounded on\nreason. Why, Sir, should I believe the faculty of reason more than\nthat of perception; they came both out of the same shop, and were made\nby the same artist; and if he puts one piece of false ware into my\nhands, what should hinder him from putting another? (IHM VI.xx: 169)\n\n\nReid continues in this vein, noting that trusting our indigenous\nfaculties does not imply that we must suppose that they operate\nflawlessly:\n\nThere is no more reason to account our senses fallacious, than our\nreason, our memory, or any other faculty of judging which nature hath\ngiven us. They are all limited and imperfect\u2026. We are liable to\nerror and wrong judgment in the use of them all; but as little in the\ninformations of sense as in the deductions of reasoning.
