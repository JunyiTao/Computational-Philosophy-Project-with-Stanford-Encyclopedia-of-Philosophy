    "main_text": "Extant Writings\n3. The Problem of Authorship\n\nThe title of a recently published manuscript, dated to the 13th or\n14th century and containing a Prior Analytics commentary,\nsuggests that Elias, who is named as the author of the commentary,\nonce held the office of prefect in the Byzantine empire. In the\nNovellae of Justinian, a prefect by the name of Elias is\nindeed mentioned (Novel. CLIII, dated 12 December 541; cf.\nWesterink 1961). Since the name Elias was rare in secular circles at\nthe time, Westerink proposes that unless evidence to the contrary\nemerges our commentator and the prefect should be considered\nidentical. A (praetorian or urban) prefect in the late Roman Empire\nwas, as direct representative of the emperor, the highest civilian\nadministrator of a region or city (most importantly Rome or\nConstantinople). If our commentator really held such an illustrious\noffice, presumably after he had established himself as professor of\nphilosophy (cf. the life of Themistius), he most likely also came from\na high-ranking family of nobles. Unfortunately, apart from the scant\nevidence found in the late manuscripts of the extant commentaries\nnothing further is known about a philosopher or prefect by the name of\nElias. A fairly comprehensive Byzantine list of commentators on\nPorphyry and Aristotle does not know of any philosopher by that name,\nnor do Photius (9th c. Byzantine scholar) and the author of the Suda,\na 10th c. encyclopedia. A closer look at the manuscript tradition\nreveals that the texts now attributed to Elias circulated as anonymous\nmanuscripts for a considerable time, meaning that the attribution to\none \u201cElias\u201d is a much later addition. Given that there is\nnothing explicitly Christian about these works (there are no\nreferences to the Bible, but the text abounds with references to pagan\nphilosophers and literary figures), and given that we find an explicit\navowal of doctrines that are quite obviously at variance with\nChristianity (e.g. that a philosopher must strive to imitate the sun;\nthat the world is eternal), it is possible to adopt a more skeptical\nposition (cf. Wildberg 1990). That is to say, the suspicion arises\nthat the original author may not have been Christian at all, but a\nlatter-day pagan who, like Olympiodorus, taught Greek philosophy to a\nChristian audience. In that case, the attribution of these\ncommentaries to some \u201cElias\u201d may well have been motivated\nby monastic scribes who sought to justify copying these pagan\nphilosophical texts by inventing a good Christian name for their\nauthor. Alternatively, if the author was indeed the Christian prefect\nElias, as Westerink suggests, we are invited to modify our\npreconceptions about the possibility of pagan philosophical discourse\nwithin the Christian culture of the Byzantine empire. In either case,\nthe commentaries testify to the vitality and importance of pagan\nphilosophy and learning in the mid- or late 6th century CE.\n",
