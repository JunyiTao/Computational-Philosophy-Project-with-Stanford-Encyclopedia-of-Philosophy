    "preamble": "\n\nDavid Hartley (1705\u201357) is the author of Observations on\nMan, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations (1749)\u2014a\nwide-ranging synthesis of neurology, moral psychology, and\nspirituality (i.e., our \u201cframe,\u201d \u201cduty,\u201d and\n\u201cexpectations\u201d). The Observations gained\ndedicated advocates in Britain, America, and Continental Europe, who\nappreciated it both for its science and its spirituality. As science,\nthe work grounds consciousness in neuro-physiology, mind in brain. On\nthis basis, the central concept of \u201cassociation,\u201d much\ndiscussed by other British philosophers and psychologists, receives\ndistinctive treatment: the term first names the physiological process\nthat generates \u201cideas,\u201d and then the psychological\nprocesses by which perceptions, thoughts, and emotions either link and\nfuse or break apart. In keeping with this physiological approach,\nHartley offers a conceptually novel account of how we learn and\nperform skilled actions, a dimension of human nature often left\nunexplored in works of philosophy. Such actions include those involved\nin speech\u2014and, by extension, the conduct of scientific inquiry.\nAs a work on the spiritual condition of humanity, Hartley\u2019s\nObservations affirms universal salvation\u2014the assurance\nthat all people will eventually become \u201cpartakers of the divine\nnature.\u201d In this regard, it presents an original model of\npsychological growth, which describes how the self both forms and\ntransforms, as the person gains in \u201csympathy\u201d and\n\u201ctheopathy\u201d\u2014put simply, learns to love, both others\nand God.\n\nThe son of an Anglican clergyman, David Hartley was born in June 1705\nin the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months\nafter his birth, and his father when David was fifteen. After\nreceiving his B.A. and M.A. from Jesus College, Cambridge, Hartley\npracticed medicine in Bury St. Edmunds (1730\u201335), London\n(1735\u201342), and Bath, where he died on 28 August 1757. He married\ntwice: in 1730, Alice Rowley, who died in 1731 giving birth to their\nson David (1731\u20131813); and in 1735, Elizabeth Packer\n(1713\u201378), despite the opposition of her very wealthy family.\nThe couple had two children, Mary (1736\u20131803) and Wincombe Henry\n(1740\u201394). Although severely afflicted with bladder stones,\nHartley lived a full and active life: he practiced medicine, engaged\nin mathematical research, sought a cure for \u201cthe stone,\u201d\ndevoted himself to intellectual and philanthropic projects, and wrote\nthe Observations on Man.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Reception of the Observations on Man\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Hartley\u2019s Observations\nwas valued very highly by people within the realm of religious\ndissent, scientific progress, and social reform. Writing in 1774,\nJoseph Priestley, a leading Unitarian and the foremost scientist in\nBritain, wrote that the Observations \u201ccontains a new\nand most extensive science\u201d and promised that \u201cthe study\nof it \u2026 will be like entering upon a new world.\u201d He\nadded: \u201cI think myself more indebted to this one treatise, than\nto all the books I ever read beside; the scriptures excepted\u201d\n(1774, xix).\n\nPriestley and his fellow Unitarians gave the Observations a\ncentral place in the curriculum in the dissenting academies. (For\nadmission to Oxford and Cambridge Universities, a student had to\nsubscribe to the doctrines of the Church of England\u2014a\nrequirement which excluded Unitarians, who did not accept that Jesus\nis God; hence the dissenters\u2019 need for their own institutions of\nhigher learning.) From one report, we learn that students in one\nacademy studied it for two hours every morning. In addition, in the\nlate 1700s student radicals at Cambridge and Oxford also had their\ncopies.\n\nThus the Observations was the focus of sustained study and\nhigh esteem\u2014if you followed Priestley, the most important book,\nafter the Bible. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, converted to\nPriestleian Unitarianism at Cambridge, had his portrait painted\nholding a copy of the Observations (see Paley 1999,\n18\u201323), and named his first son David Hartley Coleridge. Other\nwriters offer similar testimonies. Few works discussed in this\nencyclopedia have been the objects of such deep personal\ninvolvement.\n\nWhile its admirers thought it \u201ca new science\u201d of human\nnature, its critics\u2014including Thomas Reid (1785, 84\u201394)\nand the later Coleridge ([1817] 1983), no longer the youthful\nradical\u2014considered Hartley\u2019s Observations\nconceptually wrong and morally hazardous. For example, Sir James\nMackintosh, who sympathetically praised \u201cthe extraordinary value\nof Hartley\u2019s system\u201d (1836, 253), nonetheless saw in\nHartley\u2019s belief that consciousness derives from neurological\nprocesses an \u201cerror \u2026 deeper and more fundamental than\nany other,\u201d sure to \u201cinvolv[e] all nature in darkness and\nconfusion\u201d (245).\n\nIn the nineteenth century, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, and William\nB. Carpenter (who all had studied the Observations in\ndissenting academies), along with Alexander Bain, founded the school\nof thought known as \u201cassociation psychology.\u201d They\ncredited Hartley with being the precursor of the science they had\ndeveloped. However, John Stuart Mill wrote in the Preface to the 1869\nedition of his father\u2019s Analysis of the Phenomena of the\nHuman Mind, that, compared to his father\u2019s work,\nHartley\u2019s Observations \u201cis little more than a\nsketch, though an eminently suggestive one\u201d (Mill 1869,\n1:xi\u201312). Hardly a recommendation to read the book that the\nMills had poured over as students. Why look at the sketch, when the\nfully drawn portrait is available?\n\nBy the late 1800s Priestleian Unitarianism, as a tradition of\nphilosophical practice, had died out; academic philosophers,\nespecially those trained in the Scottish school of common sense (the\nofficial philosophy taught, for example, by the Unitarians who ran\nHarvard), knew that the Observations rested on a fundamental\nmistake; and association psychologists preserved a memory of this\nprecursor of their science. Formal interest in Hartley\u2019s\nObservations, as a work to be read and pondered, discussed in\nlectures, written about in articles and books, had collapsed. The last\nserious engagement with the Observations appears in William\nJames\u2019s Principles of Psychology (1890, 1:553), and\neven there a casual reader could easily miss it.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Hartley\u2019s Observations\nremained outside the philosophical curriculum:\nphilosophers-in-training could follow the well-traveled route from the\n\u201cBritish empiricists\u201d to Kant without turning aside to\npick it up. And even if a person had wanted to, doing so was\ndifficult, for after the editions of 1749, 1775, 1791, 1810, and 1834,\nand translations into French (1755 and 1802), German (1772), and\nItalian (1809), no further editions were published. Today, paperback\nreprints of earlier editions are available, but there is no modern\ncritical edition.\n\nIn his Second Treatise of Government, Locke famously stated\nthat \u201clabor fixes property.\u201d It is the labor of people in\nthe fields of philosophy that fixes a philosophical text as a\n\u201cproperty\u201d\u2014that marks its bounds and assesses its\nvalue. But a work that has remained outside contemporary\nphilosophy\u2019s pedagogical economy, as has Hartley\u2019s\nObservations, is in an indeterminate position. A person today\nwho picks the book up would have in hand a long book covering a\nmultitude of topics. How to determine its properties? And how to\nanswer the question of economics: What is its worth? To address these\nquestions, let us imagine how one of Hartley\u2019s colleagues, a\nFellow of the Royal Society (FRS), might have responded to the book on\nits appearance in 1749.\n2. Hartley\u2019s Observations\u2014At First Sight\n\nA FRS in regular attendance at the society\u2019s London meetings\nwould be acquainted with Hartley, and would know that he had emerged\nthe victor in a public medical controversy ten years earlier, which\nestablished his reputation in medical circles both in Britain and on\nthe Continent. Hartley, working with Stephen Hales, researched the\nchemical basis for what they thought an effective folk remedy for\nbladder stones\u2014a painful and hazardous condition that impaired\nthe lives of Hartley himself and many others, including Benjamin\nFranklin. In the course of the controversy, Hartley had published a\nself-revealing account of the prolonged and intense suffering he had\nendured, while undergoing the treatment.\n\nThe FRS would know that this orphaned son of a Yorkshire clergyman was\nnow a successful physician, thanks in part to powerful patrons\n(including the Cornwallis family, and the Duke of Newcastle, who was\nin effect prime minister), had come into personal wealth, thanks to\nhis second marriage, and that he had devoted himself to various\nphilanthropic projects, including the publication of the shorthand\nsystem devised by his friend, John Byrom.\n\nIf the FRS knew Hartley as a friend, he would know him to be a\nmathematician with a special interest in statistics, an amateur\nviolinist, and a vegetarian who saw animals as bearing a \u201cnear\nrelation\u201d to humans. He would know him as a husband and father\n(unlike Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant). He would know that Hartley\nwas often in extreme pain, and in danger of losing his life, as he\nstill suffered grievously from bladder stones. And he would know him\nto be a man with deeply unconventional religious beliefs.\n\nPicking up the Observations, such a reader would see that the\nbook presented itself as Newtonian science\u2014through the use of\n\u201cObservations\u201d in the title (compare two groundbreaking\nscientific texts, Franklin\u2019s Experiments and Observations on\nElectricity, 1751, and Priestley\u2019s Experiments and\nObservations of Different Kinds of Air, 1774), and through the\ngeometrical format of propositions and corollaries that structure the\ntext. Were he to page through the opening sections, he would see that\nthe Hartley wrote for a reader already familiar with technical\nconcepts in, for example, anatomy and physiology, and in the\nspeculative physics in Newton\u2019s Opticks.\n\nWere the reader to continue beyond the opening propositions of the\nObservations, he would encounter elements of another, older\ntradition: references to \u201cperfect self-annihilation, and the\npure love of God\u201d (OM 2, prop. 67), and quotations of\nselect biblical passages, especially the promise of becoming\n\u201cpartakers of the divine nature\u201d (2 Pet. 1.4). These place\nHartley within the realms of pietism and mysticism.\n\nSpecifically, they are expressions of the \u201ceverlasting\ngospel\u201d of universal salvation. For the Observations\nenvisions the restoration of a fallen, fragmented, and self-alienated\nhumanity to \u201cperfect manhood,\u201d in which all people,\nwithout exception, will be \u201cmembers of the mystical body of\nChrist,\u201d and as such will become \u201cnew sets of senses, and\nperceptive powers, to each other, so as to increase each others\nhappiness without limits\u201d (OM 2, prop. 68; cf. prop.\n35).\n\nNeither the scientific approach to \u201cman\u201d nor the\naffirmation of universal salvation was in itself original. One could\nfind the former in the medical literature, and in Descartes. For\nversions of the \u201ceverlasting gospel\u201d one could turn to\nvarious writers, including Peter Sterry, Cromwell\u2019s chaplain, in\nA Discourse of the Freedom of the Will (1675), Sterry\u2019s\nfellow chaplain to Cromwell, Jeremiah White, in The Restoration of\nAll Things (1712), the visionary Jane Lead, the mathematician\nThomas Bayes, in Divine Benevolence (1731), and, on the\ncontinent, Charles Hector de Marsay.\n\nWhat is distinctive about Hartley\u2019s Observations is the\nsimultaneous presence of the two approaches. Although Hartley affirms\nthat the whole person is a \u201cmechanism,\u201d subject to\nscientific study, he is no French atheist, no La Mettrie (author of\nthe notorious L\u2019Homme machine, 1748), but a person of\ndeep religious sensibility. Similarly, Hartley affirms universal\nrestoration\u2014but with none of the hallucinatory mysticism of Lead\nor Marsay. Rather, the doctrine is supported by an application of the\nlatest scientific thinking.\n\nConsider the full title: Observations on Man, his Frame, his Duty,\nand his Expectations. Hartley attempts a synthesis, by showing\nthat bodily \u201cframe,\u201d moral \u201cduty,\u201d and\nreligious \u201cexpectations\u201d all converge on the same\npoint\u2014and that point is the overcoming of the chasm between hell\nand heaven. Recall that Hartley, like other Unitarians, believed the\ndivinity of Jesus and substitutionary atonement to be doctrines that\nobscured the original light of Christianity. Thus an explanation of\n\u201csalvation\u201d as something external and undeserved has no\npart in his thinking. Rather, he offers a scientific account of how we\nare framed, both physically and psychologically, so as ultimately to\nattain the state in which we are all be \u201cpartakers of the divine\nnature, loving and lovely, holy and happy\u201d (OM 2, prop.\n56).\n3. The Science of Man\n\nThe scientific dimension of the Observations is in part\nmethodical and in part substantive. As a matter of method, Hartley\nproposes the scientific investigation of \u201cman.\u201d As noted\nabove, this is not unique; physicians had been doing just this for\ndecades, and there were also the examples of Descartes\u2019s\nPassions of the Soul (1649) and Treatise on Man\n(1664), and of Hume\u2019s anonymously published Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1739\u201340). (There is no evidence that Hartley\nknew anything about Hume, or Hume about Hartley.) What is distinctive\nabout the Observations is that it extends Newtonian science\nto the study of human nature.\n\nWe should assume, Hartley writes, that the body\u2019s\n\u201ccomponent particles\u201d are \u201csubjected to the same\nsubtle laws\u201d (OM 1, prop. 9) as are all other material\nentities. The subtle laws are those Newton suggested in the\n\u201cQueries\u201d to his Opticks, and which Stephen Hales\n(1677\u20131761, remembered today as the father of plant physiology\nand for the measurement of blood pressure) further developed in the\nchemical theory in his Statical Essays\u2014i.e.,\nVegetable Staticks (1727) and Haemastaticks (1733).\nDescartes had earlier proposed a model of neural physiology, but in\n1740s Britain the physics the model depended upon would have looked\nout of date. Hartley, in contrast, presented a \u201ctheory of\nvibrations\u201d that explained how the \u201ccomponent\nparticles\u201d that constitute the nerves and brain interact with\nthe physical universe suggested by Newton\u2014a world composed of\n\u201cforces of attraction and repulsion\u201d and having a minimum\nof solid matter.\n\nAs a matter of substance, Hartley proposes:\n\nSince therefore sensations are conveyed to the mind, by the efficiency\nof corporeal causes \u2026 it seems to me, that the powers of\ngenerating ideas, and raising them by association, must also arise\nfrom corporeal causes, and consequently admit of an explication from\nthe subtle influences of the small parts of matter on each other, as\nsoon as these are sufficiently understood. (OM 1, prop. 11)\n\n\nNote the language: \u201ccorporeal causes\u201d\n\u201cgenerate\u201d and \u201craise\u201d ideas \u201cby\nassociation.\u201d Unlike later \u201cassociation\npsychologists\u201d such as James Mill, Hartley does not start with\n\u201cideas\u201d as subjective entities already experientially\npresent to the \u201cmind\u201d and then ask how these are linked.\nRather, he starts with bodily, specifically neurological processes,\nand asks: how do such processes generate and raise our perceptions,\nemotions, thoughts, and actions? This is a proposal for neuroscience,\nnot a version of philosophical or psychological\n\u201cempiricism.\u201d\n\nIf the responses of a nervous system to its physical environment can\ngenerate and raise one \u201cidea,\u201d one flash of consciousness,\nthey can generate any, and all. Thus \u201cthe whole superstructure\nof ideas and associations observable in human life may \u2026 be\nbuilt upon as small a foundation as we please\u201d (OM 1,\nprop. 11). For Hartley, the foundation is simple: nerves\n\u201cvibrate\u201d (on a molecular level, not as violin strings),\nchange their frequencies or amplitudes of vibration, and transmit\nthose changes to other nerves. But thanks to the vast number of\nassociative connections between nerves and within the brain, this\nfundamental mechanism generates all the complexities of action we\nobserve in living beings\u2014both animal and human.\n\nThe first volume of the Observations ends with a bold\nstatement: if an organism \u201ccould be endued with the most simple\nkinds of sensation, [it] might also arrive at all that intelligence of\nwhich the human mind is possessed\u201d (OM 1,\nConclusion).\n\nSuch is an expression of the \u201cerror \u2026 deeper and more\nfundamental than any other\u201d with which Mackintosh charged\nHartley: that of overlooking ontological dualism, \u201cthe\nprimordial and perpetual distinction between the being that thinks and\nthe thing which is thought of\u201d (1836, 245). Descartes maintained\nthis distinction by positing a substance dualism of mind and body (and\nby treating animals as \u201cmere\u201d mechanisms, without\nconsciousness, and humans as rational, sentient beings), and such as\nHume and later James Mill respected it (or at least avoided dealing\nwith it) by writing about the contents of conscious minds while\nkeeping well clear of neurophysiology. But Hartley ignores the\ndistinction between \u201cthinking\u201d and \u201cthought\nof\u201d; he affirms that neurological processes generate\nconsciousness.\n\nIn Hartley\u2019s view, animals are conscious beings, endued with\nsensation and, in neurologically complex species, their own kinds of\nintelligence: hence he affirms their \u201cnear relation\u201d to\nus\u2014which obligates us \u201cto be their guardians and\nbenefactors,\u201d and is reason to refrain from making them suffer\nfor our sport or convenience, and from killing them for food\n(OM 1, prop. 93; cf. OM 2, prop. 52).What separates\nus from animals are simply differences in neuro-anatomy.\n\nAccept that \u201call that intelligence of which the human mind is\npossessed\u201dcould be arrived at by an organism possessing\n\u201cthe most simple kinds of sensation,\u201d and what follows? To\nmany, a line of thought \u201cinvolving all nature into darkness and\nconfusion.\u201d To others, with Priestley, the way of\n\u201centering upon a new world\u201d of scientific discovery, free\nof the dualism of spirit and matter.\n4. Perception and Action: The Role of \u201cJoint Impression\u201d\n\nHartley\u2019s starting point is the living organism, and\nspecifically the physical \u201cvibrations\u201d present in brain\nand nervous system and in the universe with which the organism\ninteracts. From this starting point, two important considerations\nfollow. The first is that sensations and ideas are products, not\ngivens, and their \u201cgeneration\u201d and \u201craising\u201d\nrequire explanation. The second involves the recognition that\norganisms are active beings. Like other animals, humans move about in,\nexplore, and interact with their environments. What is more, humans\nbecome adept at performing various kinds of learned, highly skilled\nactions\u2014e.g., playing the violin. The \u201cideas\u201d humans\nhave largely occur within, and guide, such practices.\n\nConcerning the first consideration: although \u201cassociation\u201d\nis a central concept in the Observations, it is not primarily\na name for the process by which discrete experiential entities link\nup; rather, the process of neurological association generates ideas,\nincluding our categories of perception. In proposition 11, Hartley\nstates that \u201cideas, and miniature vibrations, must first be\ngenerated \u2026 before they can be associated.\u201d He adds:\n\nBut then (which is very remarkable) this power of forming ideas, and\ntheir corresponding miniature vibrations, does equally presuppose the\npower of association. For since all sensations and vibrations are\ninfinitely divisible, in respect of time and place, they could not\nleave any traces or images of themselves, i.e. any ideas, or miniature\nvibrations, unless their infinitesimal parts did cohere together\nthrough joint impression, i.e. association. (OM 1, prop. 11)\n\n\nBy stating that \u201call sensations and vibrations are infinitely\ndivisible,\u201d Hartley is elaborating on a point made by George\nBerkeley, in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision ([1709]\n1948), that a being born \u201cblind\u201d to bodily feeling and\npossessing only sight would have no concept of space and would be\nunable to perceive a geometrically ordered world. To such a being,\nsensations would be \u201cinfinitely\u201d\u2014i.e.,\narbitrarily\u2014divisible. No stable, repeatable \u201cideas\u201d\ncould arise from them.\n\nHartley also agrees with Berkeley\u2019s solution to this problem: we\nperceive a coherent world thanks to the generation of\n\u201cideas\u201d (cognitive, semantic, and pragmatic responses to\nthe world) through the \u201cjoint impression\u201d of sensations\nfrom distinct sensory modalities\u2014sight, hearing, and especially\ntouch. As does Berkeley, Hartley identifies feeling or touch as\n\u201cthe fundamental source of information in respect of the\nessential properties of matter\u201d and \u201cour first and\nprinciple key to the knowledge of the external world\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 30). Thus, Hartley writes, \u201cwe call the\ntouch the reality, light the representative.\u201d The sense of sight\n\u201cmay be considered, agreeably to Bishop Berkeley\u2019s remark,\nas a philosophical language for the ideas of feeling\u201d (see\nBerkeley [1709] 1948, sections 6.4, 6.8, and 9.4).\n\nA \u201cphilosophical language\u201d is one \u201cwithout any\ndeficiency, superfluity, or equivocation\u201d (OM 1, prop.\n83), and what makes sight a \u201cphilosophical language\u201d for\nfeeling is that the two match each other: \u201cThe same qualities\nare made by means of light to impress vibrations on our eyes, which\ncorrespond in great measure to those made on the sense of feeling, so\nas to vary with their varieties\u201d (OM 1, prop. 30).\nFeeling and vision flow in tandem, with no missing, extraneous, or\nequivocal moves. It is thus joint impression, the correlation of the\nflows of sensation through two (or more) sensory modalities, so that\nthe sensations one \u201cvary with the varieties\u201d of another,\nthat accounts for the fact that we have ideas at all.\n\nIn contrast, a person whose visual inputs are dissociated from his\nother sensory modalities, and especially his own movement and feeling,\nis unable to consistently identify any \u201cvisual ideas.\u201d\nSuch is the condition of a person suffering from a visual agnosia (see\nJames 1890, 1:48\u201350).\n\nThis first consideration thus naturally leads to the second, for both\nHartley, and Berkeley before him, are talking about the actions of an\nembodied being. A living being\u2019s capacities for sensory\ndiscrimination, feature detection, and perceptual categorization are\nall involved with the repertoires of action that being performs,\neither innately or through learning.\n\nFor many animals, the ways in which physical movements vary with the\nvarieties of visual cues is relatively fixed: cats pounce on mice\n(some of cloth), and swat at moths (or moving shadows on a sunlit\nwall). For human beings, thanks to the brain\u2019s plasticity in\nforming \u201cjoint impressions,\u201d there are many ways in which\nthe \u201cvarieties\u201d of one sensation \u201cvary with the\nvarieties\u201d of another: at the sight of notes on a staff, fingers\nmove determinately upon a piano keyboard. Expert musicians, at the\nsight of the notes, hear the tune in their mind\u2019s ear.\n\nBut how to explain what it is that the expert musician (or any expert\npractitioner) does? And how does one learn to do this?\n5. The Range of Actions: From \u201cAutomatic\u201d to \u201cDecomplex\u201d\n\nIn the Observations, Hartley offers a conceptually novel\ntreatment of physical action\u2014a topic largely absent from other\ntreatises, or inquiries, devoted to \u201chuman nature\u201d or\n\u201chuman understanding.\u201d Even in James Mill\u2019s\nAnalysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind, a work with an\nacknowledged debt to Hartley, bodily action is touched on only in the\nlast chapter of the book, on \u201cThe Will.\u201d But to an\nattentive \u201cobserver of man,\u201d it should be obvious that we\nlive by doing, by performing tasks that depend on repertoires of\nperfected movement, some (like walking) mastered in infancy, others\n(like typing) later in life.\n\nHartley invented to two words to describe physical movements:\n\u201cautomatic\u201d and \u201cdecomplex.\u201d\n\nHartley formed the adjective \u201cautomatic\u201d from an existing\nnoun, \u201cautomaton,\u201d to describe movements such as\n\u201cthe motions of the heart, and the peristaltic motion of the\nbowels\u201d (OM 1, Introduction). Such \u201coriginally\nautomatic\u201d motions are homeostatic: As a heart beats, the\nalternation of contraction and relaxation is maintained and modified\nin response to the needs and experiences of the organism (OM\n1, prop. 19).\n\nFollowing the discussion of \u201coriginally automatic\u201d motion\nis this theorem: \u201cIf any sensation A, idea B, or motion C, be\nassociated \u2026 with any other sensation D, idea E, or muscular\nmotion F, it will, at last, excite d, the simple idea belonging to\nsensation D, the very idea E, or the very muscular motion F\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 20). Through the physical association or neural\nimpulses in the brain, any sensation, idea, or muscular motion can\nbecome the stimulus that excites any other idea or muscular motion.\nOne\u2019s heart beats faster at the sight, sound, or thought of\nsomething one has learned to fear.\n\nThe formation of such novel associations of stimuli to physiological\nresponses means that \u201coriginally automatic\u201d motions can\ntransform into motions that are \u201cvoluntary\u201d or\n\u201csecondarily automatic\u201d (OM 1, prop. 21).\n\nAn action is voluntary when its stimulus is an \u201cidea, or state\nof mind \u2026 which we term the will\u201d (OM 1, prop.\n21). To illustrate how ideas of the form \u201cthe will to\n\u2026\u201d derive from \u201coriginally automatic\u201d\nmotions, Hartley describes how a child gains motor control over parts\nand functions of her body. \u201cOriginally automatic\u201d motions\nare brought under control through a series of substitutions of the\ninitiating stimulus. An infant grasps the finger placed in her palm,\nand then the toy she sees, and then grasps at \u201cthe sound of the\nwords grasp, take hold, &c., the sight of the nurse\u2019s hand,\nin that state, the idea of a hand, and particularly the child\u2019s\nown hand.\u201d These and \u201cinnumerable other associated\ncircumstances \u2026 will put the child upon grasping, till, at\nlast, that idea, or state of mind which we may call the will to grasp,\nis generated and sufficiently associated with the action to produce it\ninstantaneously.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that, in Hartley\u2019s account, the\nperformance of a voluntary movement is not a dualistic, two-stage\nprocess, with an executive \u201cfaculty\u201d of the Mind, the\nWill, first issuing an instruction that the body then carries out.\nRather, a movement becomes voluntary through the living being\u2019s\ninteraction with the \u201cinnumerable \u2026 associated\ncircumstances\u201d of its environment, which interactions bring\nabout a series of substitutions of the initiating stimulus. In this\nlight, \u201cwill\u201d does not name anything substantive: it is a\nword we use to describe an \u201cidea, or state of mind.\u201d And\nit is a word people often use to express bafflement as to what this\n\u201cstate of mind\u201d amounts to. Hartley notes that adults\nstart calling a child willful at the time he learns to walk, because\n\u201cthe child, in some cases, does not walk when desired, whilst\nyet the circumstances are apparently the same as when he does. For\nhere the unapparent cause of walking, or not walking, is\nwill\u201d (OM 1, prop. 77). But, he adds, \u201ca\ncareful observation \u2026 will always shew \u2026 that when\nchildren do different things, the real circumstances, natural or\nassociated, are proportionally different, and that the state of mind\ncalled will depends on the difference.\u201d\n\nSequences of substitutions transform originally automatic actions into\nvoluntary ones. Hartley recognizes that the process continues, so that\nvoluntary actions in turn become what he terms \u201csecondarily\nautomatic\u201d:\n\nAfter the actions, which are most perfectly voluntary, have been\nrendered so by one set of associations, they may, by another, be made\nto depend upon the most diminutive sensations, ideas, and motions,\nsuch as the mind scarce regards, or is conscious of; and which it can\ntherefore scarce recollect the moment after the action is over. Hence\nit follows, that association not only converts automatic actions into\nvoluntary, but voluntary ones into automatic. For these actions\n\u2026 are rather to be ascribed to the body than the mind, i.e. are\nto be referred to the head of automatic motions. I shall call them\nautomatic motions of the secondary kind, to distinguish them from\nthose which are originally automatic, and from the voluntary ones.\n(OM 1, prop. 21)\n\n\nThink of learning to type or play the piano. At first one develops a\nrepertoire of voluntary motions. But fluency requires that the motions\nbe secondarily automatic.\n\nTo his critics, notably Reid and the later Coleridge, Hartley\u2019s\ncommitment to \u201cmechanism\u201d impeached the \u201cfreedom of\nthe will\u201d and hence moral responsibility. But where such critics\nwere intent on affirming the adult self\u2019s executive control over\nthought and action, Hartley\u2019s concern is the opposite: he starts\nwith the infant and asks, How does a child gain control of the\noriginally automatic processes present in infancy? Gain motor control\nof her hands? Learn to walk, and dance? Play a musical instrument?\nTransform spontaneous burbling and crying into articulate speech?\nHartley\u2019s critics accuse him of reducing the human being to a\n\u201cmere mechanism.\u201d But from a Hartleian perspective, the\n\u201cmechanism\u201d of \u201csecondarily automatic\u201d actions\nis an achievement, not a given\u2014and a necessary achievement, if\none is to live a complete human life.\n\nMost human competencies, though voluntarily performed, rely upon\nextensive repertoires of secondarily automatic actions. Such\nperformances are not prespecified and inflexible routines. When people\nplay music, they add flourishes, and improvise if they are\nsufficiently skilled. When they do so, the actions they perform are\nwhat Hartley calls \u201cdecomplex.\u201d\n\nReaders of the Observations would have been familiar with the\nwords \u201cdecompound\u201d and\n\u201cdecomposite\u201d\u2014both from the late Latin\ndecompositus, a rendering of the Greek\nparasynthetos\u2014in which the \u201cde-\u201d prefix\nsignifies \u201crepeatedly\u201d or \u201cfurther.\u201d They\nwould also know the word \u201ccomplex,\u201d from Locke\u2019s\nEssay concerning Human Understanding: \u201cIdeas thus made\nup of several simple ones put together, I call Complex; such as are\nBeauty, Gratitude, a Man, an Army, the Universe\u201d (Locke [1690]\n1975, 2.12.1).\n\nAvailable to Hartley were both Locke\u2019s distinction between\n\u201csimple\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d and also instances in\nwhich the de- prefix meant \u201cfurther.\u201d On the analogy of\n\u201ccompound\u201d to \u201cdecompound,\u201d he wrote of ideas\nand actions being either \u201ccomplex\u201d or\n\u201cdecomplex.\u201d In Hartley\u2019s theory, the associations\nin a complex action or idea are synchronic, while the associations in\na decomplex action or idea are diachronic. In playing a piano, hitting\nthe D key at the sight of the printed note D is a complex movement,\nwhile playing a composition is a decomplex action.\n\nThe elements of a secondarily automatic, complex movement are tightly\nfused. In contrast, those in a decomplex action or idea are more\nloosely associated (OM 1, prop. 12); this looseness makes it\npossible to include a repertoire of secondarily automatic movements in\na variety of decomplex ones\u2014the same notes in an endless number\nof tunes. Hartley also observes that people find it impossible to\nperform decomplex actions\u2014play a tune, say a\nsentence\u2014backward.\n\nDecomplex actions draw on different kinds of complex movements,\ninvolving the association of movements with perceptions in one or more\nsensory modalities: at the sight of the notes on the staff, or the\nsound of the tones, the pianist hits the keys. As a person becomes\nproficient at a type of decomplex action, the guiding sensory modality\ncan change. When learning to dance, Hartley observes, at first\n\u201cthe scholar desires to look at his feet and legs, in order to\njudge by seeing when they are in a proper position,\u201d but\n\u201cby degrees he learns to judge of this by feeling\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 77). Similarly, a practiced musician plays the\nharpsichord from \u201cthe connexion of the several complex parts of\nthe decomplex motions\u201d (OM 1, prop. 21). One\u2019s\nhands know the tune.\n\nHartley improvised with language in order to articulate a new\nunderstanding of human action. Use of the one word became \u2026\nautomatic. The other never made it into circulation. In a world in\nwhich \u201cdecompose\u201d means \u201cto rot,\u201d it was\ndoomed. Nonetheless, we lack a widely available word for the concept\nthat \u201cdecomplex\u201d names.\n\nHartley\u2019s account draws particular attention to the dependency\nof our capacities for intentionality, flexibility, and innovation in\nour decomplex actions upon the repertoires of actions we have made\nsecondarily automatic. It thus centers upon a key insight: \u201cAll\nour voluntary powers are of the nature of memory\u201d (OM\n1, prop. 90).\n6. Language and Thought\n\nIn Hartley\u2019s account, at birth we enter the world already\nhumming with \u201coriginally automatic\u201d motions. Thanks to the\nactivity of our brain and nerves, these motions are self-regulating\nand homeostatic, responsive to bodily feedback and external stimuli.\nThen, as we grow, we gain voluntary control over some of our\nmovements, perfect those that become secondarily automatic, and learn\nto carry out decomplex actions that draw on repertoires of secondarily\nautomatic components.\n\nIn Hartley\u2019s account of human nature, the concept of the\n\u201cassociation of ideas\u201d plays a central role. But the\nparadigmatic instances of \u201cassociation\u201d are, first, the\n\u201cjoint impressions\u201d that generate \u201cideas\u201d\n(including complex movements), and second, the flowing cascades of\nmovement that are decomplex actions. Such decomplex actions are\ncentral to the lives we lead. And foremost among decomplex actions are\nthe sentences we speak.\n\nFor Hartley, language is a highly \u201cdecomplex\u201d motor\nactivity that involves the cementing of associations between perceived\nand created sounds, and, for the literate, perceived and created\nmarks: \u201cimpressions made on the ear,\u201d \u201cactions of\nthe organs of speech,\u201d \u201cimpressions made upon the\neye,\u201d and \u201cactions of the hand in writing\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 79). Further connections must be made between\nperceived or created sounds and features of the world, especially the\nactions of oneself and of other people. Hartley\u2019s approach is\nnearly the opposite of Locke\u2019s, who writes as if language were a\ndictionary, in which each word marks an idea known prelinguistically\nto the speaker: \u201cwords being voluntary signs, they cannot be\nvoluntary signs imposed by [the speaker] on things he knows\nnot\u2026 . Till he has some ideas of his own, he cannot suppose\nthem to correspond with the conceptions of another man; nor can he use\nany signs for them\u201d (Locke [1690] 1975, 3.2.2).\n\nThus while Locke seems to be saying that individuals first have ideas,\nand then turn to language to communicate them to others, Hartley\ndescribes a process whereby, as children, we burble and cry and\nlisten\u2014and gradually gain motor control of our burbling and\ncrying, associate it with what we hear and handle and do, and\neventually learn the meaning of what we say. Once again, the process\nof association\u2014here the activity of hearing and speaking, and\nlater reading and writing\u2014generates ideas: we have ideas because\nwe use language, in concrete social interactions; we do not create\nlanguage to express the ideas we, as lone individuals, already\nhave.\n\nIn this regard, consider Hume\u2019s assertion that, if we are unsure\nabout the meaning of a word, \u201cwe need but enquire, from what\nimpression is that supposed idea derived?\u201d (Hume [1748]\n1975, 22), and his recommendation that we abandon words that lack such\nderivations. From Hartley\u2019s point of view, this is manifestly\nbad advice.\n\nFor Hartley, complex and decomplex ideas are wholes that do not\n\u201cbear any relation to [their] compounding parts.\u201d\nSpecifically, \u201cthe decomplex idea belonging to any sentence is\nnot compounded merely of the complex ideas belonging to the words in\nit\u201d (OM 1, prop. 12). The meaning of an utterance is a\nproperty of the whole\u2014of the performance of a specific decomplex\naction in a social and pragmatic context. Moreover, \u201cboth\nchildren and adults learn the ideas belonging to whole sentences many\ntimes in a summary way, and not by adding together the ideas of the\nseveral words in the sentence.\u201d Consequently, children and\nilliterate adults find it hard to \u201cseparate sentences into the\nseveral words which compound them\u201d (OM 1, prop.\n80).\n\nThus the meanings of sentences are not simply derivable from the\nmeanings of the words in them, and the meanings of those words are not\nderivable from the \u201cimpressions\u201d to which they refer. When\nchildren begin to speak, they utter \u201csentences\u201d that,\nthough short (Mommy!) are whole, complete, and meaningful\nexpressions. It is only when they learn to read that they realize\nsentences are composed of individual words. Over time, the sentences\nincrease in decomplexity, as people participate in the activities of\nlife. As adults, people speak a vast variety of highly decomplex\nexpressions\u2014including, for example, those involved in the\npractice of a science, or a religion.\n7. Language as Algebra\n\nGiven that meaning is a property of complete expressions, Hartley is\nquick to point out that individual words often lack definite, shared\nmeanings. Such indefiniteness is, in Hartley\u2019s view, hardly a\ndefect, but rather a valuable feature of language. Hartley writes that\nlanguage is \u201cone species of algebra,\u201d and algebra\n\u201cnothing more than the language \u2026 peculiarly fitted to\nexplain quantity of all kinds\u201d (OM 1, 80).\n\nThe algebraic quality of language is especially important in\nscientific practice. Like x and y in algebra,\nscientific terms, such as Hartley\u2019s \u201cvibrations\u201d or\ncontemporary physicists\u2019 \u201cparticles,\u201d stand for\nunknowns, for which vibrating strings or grains of sand provide only\nloose and misleading analogies. Their presence is necessary for the\npractice of scientific discovery. Scientists employ\n\u201calgebraic\u201d terms in order to discern correlations and\npatterns that might otherwise remain unobserved: \u201cBringing an\nunknown quantity into a relation answers, in philosophy, to the art of\ngiving names, expressing nothing definite \u2026 and then inserting\nthese names \u2026 in all the enunciations of the phenomena, to see\nwhether, from a comparison of these terms with each other, something\ndefinite in manner, degree, or mutual relation might result\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 87).\n\nIn such scientific practice, the more algebraic\u2014i.e., free from\nassociation with sense \u201cimpressions\u201d\u2014words are the\nbetter. (Thus \u201cquark\u201d is an inspired choice.) Hume\u2019s\nadvice, to use only terms referring to clear\n\u201cimpressions,\u201d if followed, would bring the practice of a\nscience to a halt.\n\nHowever, to turn this around, the utility of words for unknowns\ndepends upon their proper use within ongoing practices. For examples\nof how to conduct scientific inquiry, Hartley turns to mathematical\nmethods, and he includes an extensive discussion of these in\nproposition 87 of volume 1 of the Observations, which is\ntitled: \u201cTo deduce Rules for the Ascertainment of Truth, and\nAdvancement of Knowledge, from the Mathematical Methods of considering\nQuantity.\u201d\n\nOne deduction involves the comparison of scientific investigation to\nthe use of the rule of the false position in arithmetic: \u201cHere a\nfirst position is obtained, which, though not accurate, approaches,\nhowever, to the truth. From this, applied to the equations, a second\nposition is deduced, which approaches nearer to the truth than the\nfirst; from the second a third, etc.\u201d Hartley adds that\n\u201cthis is indeed the way, in which advances in science are\ncarried on; and scientific persons are aware, that it is and must be\nso\u201d (OM 1, prop. 87).\n\n\u201cI frame no hypotheses.\u201d Thus had Newton famously written\nin the Principia. Hartley responds directly: \u201cIt is in\nvain,\u201d he writes, \u201cto bid an inquirer form no\nhypothesis\u201d (OM 1, prop. 87). Remember that Hartley was\na practicing physician; on the basis of ambiguous symptoms and\nfallible medical knowledge, he was every day \u201cframing\nhypotheses,\u201d making diagnoses. The question, for Hartley,\nconcerns the degree of confidence we may place in our hypotheses. How\ndo we measure how far our \u201cfirst position\u201d is from the\ntruth, when we don\u2019t know what the truth is? And how do we\nmeasure the degree to which the degree of error in our second and\nthird positions has diminished?\n\nIn this regard, what is most interesting in proposition 87 is\nHartley\u2019s discussion of probability. Hartley appears to have\nbeen one of a small circle of mathematicians who read, and understood,\npapers making fundamental contributions to the theory of probability\nby Abraham De Moivre (1667\u20131754) and Thomas Bayes\n(1702\u201361). De Moivre developed a theorem that allows for the\ndetermination of the degree of convergence between the frequency of\nobserved events and the underlying probability ratio, for any finite\nnumber of events. More important is \u201cthe solution to the inverse\nproblem,\u201d which Hartley says \u201can ingenious friend\u201d\ncommunicated to him. This would be Bayes\u2019s\ntheorem\u2014customarily attributed to Thomas Bayes\u2014which deals\nwith determining the probability with which probability ratios can be\ninferred from observed outcomes, and which provides (a still\ncontroversial) foundation for statistical inference. In his discussion\nof probability theory, and other mathematical topics, Hartley is\nprimarily interested in methods for moving from observation to\nexplanation, of assessing the likeliness\u2014i.e,\nbelievability\u2014of hypotheses.\n\nHartley, like Hume, thought that belief was largely a matter of\nsentiment. \u201cRational assent\u201d is a matter of the strength\nof the association between a sentence (or even some of the words in\nit!) and the word \u201ctrue\u201d (OM 1, prop. 86)\n\u201cPractical assent,\u201d a person\u2019s willingness to act,\ndepends on the vividness the proposition\u2014and such can even make\n\u201can interesting event, supposed doubtful, or even fictitious,\n\u2026 appear like a real one,\u201d thereby pulling rational\nassent after it. (Hartley notes, dryly, \u201cthe foundation of\nassent is still the same. I here describe the fact only.\u201d) But\nHartley was not content to stop here, an exponent of an urbane\nskepticism. Belief and assent are matters of feeling, of sentiment,\nyes\u2014but there are mathematical ways of thinking about the\nprobabilities of belief. And people who think mathematically make\nbetter physicians and scientists. (How many trials of an unproven\ntreatment for bladder stones does one have to run, to reach a\nthreshold degree of belief in the results?) In this regard, it is fair\nto say that Hartley was one of the first Bayesians.\n\nOne other consequence of Hartley\u2019s practice-oriented,\n\u201calgebraic\u201d approach to language concerns the validity of\nalternate languages. In the \u201cpopular\u201d language we use\nevery day, we talk of our choices, intentions, and resolutions, but in\nthe \u201cphilosophical\u201d language of the Observations,\nHartley proposed we think in terms of \u201cphilosophical\nnecessity\u201d\u2014in which every \u201cvoluntary\u201d action\nis \u201cexcited by an associated circumstance\u201d (OM 1,\n70). Some people had, and have, no use for such talk: it denies the\nfreedom (and indeed, the existence) of the will. Hartley argues that\nthe use of two incommensurable languages, \u201cpopular\u201d and\n\u201cphilosophical,\u201d is not a problem, provided that we use\nthem separately and consistently: \u201cinsuperable difficulties will\narise\u201d only \u201cif we mix these languages\u201d (OM 2, prop.\n15). Both languages work, in their own contexts of practice.\n\nHartley had a warrant for this affirmative approach to languages in\nhis scientific and mathematical training: Newton wrote the\nPrincipia in the language of geometry, but the\n\u201cmathematical principles of natural philosophy\u201d could be\nequally (and better?) expressed in the \u201calgebraic\u201d\nlanguage of the calculus\u2014for which there were rival notations.\nSimilarly, Hartley championed a new \u201cnotation\u201d for the\nEnglish language\u2014his friend John Byrom\u2019s shorthand, which\nhe saw as a reform that would make our written language more closely\napproximate a \u201cphilosophical\u201d one. When he began work on\nthe Observations, he conceived of the project as\ndemonstrating that language about \u201cself-interest,\u201d the\n\u201ccommon good,\u201d and the \u201cwill of God\u201d were\ndifferent ways of saying the same thing. The project was thus as much\nmoral and religious as it was scientific.\n8. Moral Psychology\n\nAs noted above, Hartley believed that all people will ultimately\nbecome \u201cpartakers of the divine nature.\u201d Such is the\n\u201ceverlasting gospel\u201d of universal salvation. Moreover,\nHartley sought to show that the gathering together of all humanity\ninto the \u201cmystical body of Christ\u201d is a process inherent\nin our nature: the psychological dynamic of association, which\ngenerates our ideas and perfects our secondarily automatic movements,\nalso \u201chas a tendency to reduce the state of those who have eaten\nof the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, back again to a\nparadisiacal one\u201d (OM 1, prop. 14). The question is,\nhow does association accomplish this?\n\nTo see how it does, we must look (1) more closely at the concept of\nassociation, (2) at Hartley\u2019s notion of\n\u201ctransference,\u201d and (3) at the series of psychological\norientations association and transference generate. And as we do so,\nwe should keep in mind that many of those who studied the\nObservations in the dissenting academies appear to have\nvalued Hartley primarily as a moral theorist and exemplar\u2014for,\nthat is, his description of the path of moral transformation. Such is\na common theme in their recollections.\n\n(1) We noted above Hartley\u2019s collaboration with his friend\nStephen Hales to discover a medical treatment that would dissolve\nbladder stones. Following Newton, Hales believed \u201cforces of\nattraction and repulsion\u201d to be the basis of physical nature,\nand through various chemical experiments he demonstrated that solid\nconcretions, including bladder stones, were compounds that had locked\nwithin themselves large quantities of \u201cair,\u201d which\nnormally manifests a strongly repelling force. The \u201cair\u201d\nwithin a bladder stone could be released, and the stone dissolved,\nthrough reaction with an agent that would change the pH of the urine.\nSuch chemicals are plentiful in the laboratory; the two men were\nlooking for one that a person could safely ingest.\n\nIn his Statical Essays, Hales proposes that \u201cair\u201d\nis a component in many \u201canimal, vegetable, and mineral\nsubstances\u201d:\n\nIf all the parts of matter were only endued with a strongly attracting\npower, whole nature would then immediately become one unactive\ncohering lump; wherefore it was absolutely necessary \u2026 that\nthere should be every where intermixed with it a due proportion of\nstrongly repelling elastick particles, \u2026 [and] that these\nparticles should be endued with a property of resuming their elastick\nstate, . . . that thereby this beautiful frame of things might be\nmaintained in a continual round of the production and dissolution of\nanimal and vegetable bodies. (Hales 1769, 1:314\u201315)\n\n\nA seemingly inert particle of matter contains within itself forces of\nattraction and repulsion in a dynamic equilibrium. (Hence the\nreadiness of the particles constituting the nerves to\n\u201cvibrate.\u201d) In such particles concretions and dissolutions\noccur continuously; the materials within the bodies of living things\nform, dissolve, and form again\u2014\u201cthat thereby this\nbeautiful frame of things might be maintained.\u201d\n\nHartley extends these chemical concepts to psychology. As an analogy\nto the forces of \u201cattraction\u201d and \u201crepulsion,\u201d\nhe writes of both \u201cassociations\u201d and\n\u201ccounter-associations\u201d at work in generating the frame of\na person\u2019s self. The role of association is\nobvious\u2014through \u201cjoint impression,\u201d it generates\n\u201cideas,\u201d including the complex movements that are the\nbasis of the decomplex actions we perform every day. And as we shall\nsee shortly, psychological associations form (\u201cmodel\u201d) the\nbasic orientations of the self. But \u201ccounter-associations\u201d\nare equally vital. The counter-associations in our dreams, for\nexample, are \u201cof singular use to us, by interrupting and\nbreaking the course of our associations. For, if we were always awake,\nsome accidental associations would be cemented by continuance, as that\nnothing could afterwards disjoin them, which would be madness\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 91). A sane mind, therefore, is one\n\u201cmaintained in a continual round of the production and\ndissolution\u201d\u2014in, that is, a dynamic balance of connection\nand detachment, memory and forgetting, that holds out the possibility\nof change and transformation.\n\n(2) We noted in the discussion of action that, in Hartley\u2019s\ntheory, a child gains voluntary control over his body through a series\nof substitutions. A similar series of substitutions, or\n\u201ctransferences\u201d of emotion, are at work in the formation\nof a person\u2019s character. For example, Hartley offers a\nfascinating, detailed account of how the spontaneous gesture by which\na frightened, abused child raises his hand to ward off a blow becomes,\nthrough a series of such transferences, the blow the abusing adult\ndirects in anger at a helpless child (OM 1, prop. 97). Here,\nthe links by which fear is transferred, and transmuted into anger,\ninclude the situational, symbolic, and semantic: from, for example,\nbeing struck to the \u201csigns and tokens\u201d of an impending\nbeating\u2014e.g., the bottle of gin, or the words of abuse and\naffection, the curses and kisses, that attend drunkenness.\n\n(3) Hartley offers an original model of psychological development. The\nvarious emotional states (\u201cpleasures and pains\u201d) we\nexperience structure themselves into \u201csix classes\u201d:\nimagination, ambition, self-interest, sympathy, theopathy, and the\nmoral sense. These form two groups of three, each consisting of two\nbasic orientations and a means of regulating them.\n\nThe first group consists of imagination, the orientation toward\nobjects as sources of pleasure or displeasure, and of ambition,\nwhereby pleasure or pain derive from one\u2019s awareness of\none\u2019s standing in the eyes of others. In this group\nself-interest is the ego, which attempts to manage and satisfy the\ndemands of imagination and ambition. The second group combines\nsympathy, the orientation of personal intersubjectivity, and\ntheopathy, the person\u2019s relationship with what the person takes\nto be the divine. (\u201cTheopathy\u201d appears to be\nHartley\u2019s invention.) Hartley calls the moral sense (a term then\nin widespread use) the \u201cmonitor\u201d of sympathy and\ntheopathy; it is a higher ego, or self, beyond the ego.\n\nThe psychological structure the groups represent is epigenetic and\ntransformative. Like the accounts of twentieth-century psychologists\nsuch as Maslow, Erikson, and Kohlberg, Hartley\u2019s theory\ndescribes a process of moral development as a sequence of\ntransformations of the self.\n\nThe process is epigenetic in that the earlier orientations\n\u201cmodel\u201d the orientations that follow them. A young child,\nfor example, enjoys a pleasure of imagination when playing with new\ntoys; but when that pleasure transfers to the status that derives from\nbeing perceived by others to be a (good) child who has a collection of\nprized toys, the child is now experiencing a pleasure of ambition. And\nimagination and ambition then \u201cmodel\u201d self-interest, as\nthe child weighs the pleasures and pains, benefits and costs, of\nactually playing with the toys versus keeping them on the shelf for\npurposes of display. The problem remains in later life, when the\npleasures of purchased objects derive more from their symbolic value\nthan from actual use. This is especially the case when the purchases\nare made to satisfy the pleasures of ambition\u2014of being perceived\nas the kind of person who can own a Mercedes, or who is fluent in the\nconstantly changing idioms of fashion.\n\nAlso contributing to the epigenetic modeling of the self is the fact\nthat imagination, ambition, and self-interest inevitably generate\ncounter-associations\u2014experiences of pain or indifference where\none anticipated pleasure. Indulgence in the pleasures of imagination,\nHartley writes, often \u201clead[s] men into such a degree of\nsolicitude, anxiety, and fearfulness, in minute affairs, as to make\nthem inflict upon themselves greater torments, than the most cruel\ntyrant could invent\u201d (OM 2, 54). Similarly with\nambition: keeping up with the \u201clatest\u201d fashion (in cars,\nclothes, or philosophers) for the sake of winning others\u2019\napproval is hard work.\n\n\u201cWe do, and must, upon our entrance into the world, begin with\nidolatry to external things, and, as we advance in it, proceed to the\nidolatry of ourselves\u201d (OM 2, prop. 4). Some thus\nremain, anxiously pouring their sacrifices over these concretions. In\nothers the inevitable, painful counter-associations act as solvents,\nand cause the stony idols to disintegrate. Sympathy and theopathy\nreplace imagination and ambition as \u201cprimary pursuits,\u201d\nthe fundamental modes of experience and interaction. Hartley calls\nthis reorienting transformation the \u201cannihilation of\nself.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cannihilation\u201d is not quasi-mystical obliteration;\nrather, it is a reorientation toward, or discovery of, a higher self\nof sympathy, theopathy, and the moral sense. It involves liberation\nfrom what William Blake calls the \u201cmind-forged manacles\u201d\nof a self-created and self-regarding hell and an awakening to\none\u2019s true humanity.\n\nOnce they are \u201cmodeled,\u201d the higher orientations\n\u201cnew-model\u201d the lower. For the person for whom sympathy\nand theopathy are primary pursuits, imagination and ambition remain\nmodes of interaction, but modes that are transformed. Beauty may now\nbe perceived in people and things previously passed over with\nindifference or distaste. And one\u2019s happiness, indeed\none\u2019s hopes for one\u2019s self, may be linked with the\nhappiness of people one previously sought to avoid.\n\nThis does not mean, for Hartley, that life gets easier. Rather he\ndescribes the path as increasingly difficult. Although profoundly\noptimistic about the ultimate future of humanity\u2014he is\ndescribing, after all, how association tends \u201cto reduce the\nstate of those who have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil, back again to a paradisiacal one\u201d\u2014he is acutely\naware of the many bypaths of human self-deception and destructiveness.\nHe is especially conscious of the dangers facing those whose primary\npursuit concerns being sympathetic, theopathic, and morally\nperceptive. Such a person can become \u201ca bitter persecuting\nspirit\u201d (OM 1, prop. 97). In general, the\n\u201chigher\u201d the level of moral and spiritual attainment, the\ngreater the potential for a crippling, demonic destructiveness. In\nthis regard, reading Hartley one encounters a vision of human nature\nas deeply conflicted, struggling against itself\u2014a view similar\nto what one finds in Dostoyevsky or Kierkegaard.\n\nAlthough Hartley identifies \u201csympathy\u201d and\n\u201ctheopathy\u201d as basic orientations, the orientations do not\nnecessarily have a positive content. Hartley does not claim that\neveryone is kind to others, or loves God. In some, these modes are\npathological, and theopathy is often only rudimentarily developed. In\ndiscussing the \u201cassociations [that] may be observed in fact to\nbe heaped upon\u201d the word God, he observes that these\nbegin with the \u201ccompound fictitious idea\u201d children form\nwhen they \u201csuppose [God] to stand for a man whom they have never\nseen\u201d and that they end, for many people, when this idea\n\u201cis quite obliterated, without anything of a stable precise\nnature succeeding in its room\u201d (OM 1, prop. 98). Many\nadults live with feelings of fear, aversion, boredom, and sometimes an\nardent longing, directed at a blankness\u2014a mental picture, from\nwhich the central image has been effaced.\n\nHartley\u2019s model of the self in terms of imagination, ambition,\nand self-interest, and then of sympathy, theopathy, and the moral\nsense, is dynamically complex. In his moral psychology, emotions are\nlike electrical charges that easily jump from one object, symbol,\nword, or thought to another. Through such \u201ctransferences\u201d\nof emotion, the six orientations develop content; like physical\nconcretions, they coalesce, as emotional energies are bonded together.\nAnd when the energy in one is sufficiently strong, the orientation\nbecomes the person\u2019s \u201cprimary pursuit\u201d: it demands\naccretion of pleasure.\n\nStill, the model is not static, with the self fossilizing into\n\u201cone unactive cohering lump.\u201d Thanks to the interplay of\nassociations and counter-associations, the six orientations both\n\u201cmodel\u201d and \u201cnew-model\u201d each other.\nPsychological bodies are, as Hales said of vegetable and animal bodies,\nin \u201ca continual round of the production and\ndissolution\u201d\u2014until such time, Hartley believed, as when\nall shall discover their identity in that \u201cmystical body\u201d\nin which \u201call have an equal care for each other\u2019s\n[happiness]; all increase in love, and come to their full\nstature, to perfect manhood, by that which every joint\nsupplieth\u201d (OM 2, prop. 68; cf. Ephesians\n4.16).\n",
