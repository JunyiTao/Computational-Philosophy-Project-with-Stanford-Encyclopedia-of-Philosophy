    "main_text": "Development of EPR || Spin and The Bohm version\n3.2 Bell and beyond\n\nThat was to remain the situation for almost another fifteen years,\nuntil John Bell utilized the EPRB set-up to construct a stunning\nargument, at least as challenging as EPR, but to a different\nconclusion (Bell 1964). Bell considers correlations between\nmeasurement outcomes for systems in separate wings where the\nmeasurement axes of the systems differ by angles set locally. In his\noriginal paper, essentially using the lemma from EPR governing strict\ncorrelations, Bell shows that correlations measured in different runs\nof an EPRB experiment satisfy a system of constraints, known as the\nBell inequalities. Later demonstrations by Bell and others, using\nrelated assumptions, extend this class of inequalities. In certain of\nthese EPRB experiments, however, quantum theory predicts correlations\nthat violate particular Bell inequalities by an experimentally\nsignificant amount. Thus Bell shows (see the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem)\n that the quantum statistics are inconsistent with the given\nassumptions. Prominent among these is an assumption of locality,\nsimilar to the locality assumptions tacitly assumed in EPR and\n(explicitly) in the one-variable and many-variable arguments of\nEinstein. One important difference is that for Einstein locality\nrestricts factors that might influence the (assumed) real physical\nstates of spatially separated systems (separability). For Bell,\nlocality is focused instead on factors that might influence outcomes\nof measurements in experiments where both systems are measured. (See\nFine 1996, Chapter 4.) These differences are not usually attended to\nand Bell\u2019s theorem is often characterized simply as showing that\nquantum theory is nonlocal. Even so, since assumptions other then\nlocality are needed in any derivation of the Bell inequalities\n(roughly, assumptions guaranteeing a classical representation of the\nquantum probabilities; see Fine 1982a, and Malley 2004), one should be\ncautious about singling out locality (in Bell\u2019s sense, or Einstein\u2019s)\nas necessarily in conflict with the quantum theory, or refuted by\nexperiment.\n\nBell\u2019s results have been explored and deepened by various theoretical\ninvestigations and they have stimulated a number of increasingly\nsophisticated and delicate EPRB-type experiments designed to test\nwhether the Bell inequalities hold where quantum theory predicts they\nshould fail. With a few anomalous exceptions, the experiments appear\nto confirm the quantum violations of the inequalities. (Brunner et\nal 2014 is a comprehensive technical review.) The confirmation is\nquantitatively impressive, although not fully conclusive. There are a\nnumber of significant requirements on the experiments whose failures\n(generally downplayed as \u201cloopholes\u201d) allow for models of\nthe experimental data that embody locality (in Bell\u2019s sense),\nso-called local realist models. One family of \u201cloopholes\u201d\n(sampling) arises from possible losses (inefficiency) between emission\nand detection and from the delicate coincidence timing required to\ncompute correlations. All the early experiments to test the Bell\ninequalities were subject to this loophole, so all could be modeled\nlocally and realistically. (The prism and synchronization models in\nFine 1982b are early models of this sort. Larsson 2014 is a general\nreview.) Another \u201cloophole\u201d (locality) concerns whether\nNiels\u2019 system, in one wing, could learn about what measurements are\nset to be performed in Albert\u2019s wing in time to adjust its behavior.\nExperiments insuring locality need to separate the wings and this can\nallow losses or timing glitches that open them to models exploiting\nsampling error. Perversely, experiments to address sampling may\nrequire the wings to be fairly close together, close enough generally,\nit turns out, to allow information sharing and hence local realist\nmodels. There are now a few experiments that claim to close both\nloopholes together. They too have problems. (See Bednorz 2017 for a\ncritical discussion.)\n\nThere is also a third major complication or \u201cloophole\u201d. It\narises from the need to ensure that causal factors affecting\nmeasurement outcomes are not correlated with the choices of\nmeasurement settings. Known as \u201cmeasurement independence\u201d\nor sometimes \u201cfree choice\u201d, it turns out that even\nstatistically small violations of this independence requirement allow\nfor local realism (Putz and Gisin 2016). Since connections between\noutcomes and settings might occur anywhere in the causal past of the\nexperiment, there is really no way to insure measurement independence\ncompletely. Suitably random choices of settings might avoid this\nloophole within the time frame of the experiment, or even extend that\ntime some years into the past. An impressive, recent experiment pushes\nthe time frame back about six hundred years by using the color of\nMilky Way starlight (blue or red photons) to choose the measurement\nsettings. (Handsteiner et al 2017). Of course traveling\nbetween the Milky Way and the detectors in Vienna a lot of starlight\nis lost (over seventy per cent), which leaves the experiment wide open\nto the sampling loophole. Moreover, there is an obvious common cause\nfor settings and outcomes (and all); namely, the big bang. With that\nin mind one might be inclined to dismiss free choice as not serious\neven for a \u201cloophole\u201d. It may seem like an ad hoc\nhypothesis that postulates a cosmic conspiracy on the part of Nature\njust to the save the Bell inequalities. Note, however, that ordinary\ninefficiency can also be modeled locally as a violation of free\nchoice, because an individual measurement that produces no usable\nresult can just as well be regarded as not currently available. Since\ninefficiency is not generally counted as a violation of local\ncausality or a restriction on free will, nor as a conspiracy (well,\nnot a cosmic one), measurement dependence should not be dismissed so\nquickly. Instead, one might see measurement dependent correlations as\nnormal limitations in a system subject to dynamical constraints or\nboundary conditions, and thus use them as clues, along with other\nguideposts, in searching for a covering local theory. (See Weinstein\n2009.)\n\nExperimental tests of the Bell inequalities continue to be refined.\nTheir analysis is delicate, employing sophisticated statistical models\nand simulations. (See Elkouss and Wehner 2016 and Graft 2016.) The\nsignificance of the tests remains a lively area for critical\ndiscussion. Meanwhile the techniques developed in the experiments, and\nrelated ideas for utilizing the entanglement associated with EPRB-type\ninteractions, have become important in their own right. These\ntechniques and ideas, stemming from EPRB and the Bell theorem, have\napplications now being advanced in the field of quantum information\ntheory \u2014 which includes quantum cryptography, teleportation and\ncomputing (see\n Quantum Entanglement and Information).\n\nTo go back to the EPR dilemma between\n locality\n and completeness, it would appear from the Bell theorem that\nEinstein\u2019s preference for locality at the expense of completeness may\nhave fixed on the wrong horn. Even though the Bell theorem does not\nrule out locality conditions conclusively, it should certainly make\none wary of assuming them. On the other hand, since Einstein\u2019s\n exploding gunpowder argument\n (or Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat), along with his later arguments over\nmacro-systems, support incompleteness without assuming locality, one\nshould be wary of adopting the other horn of the dilemma, affirming\nthat the quantum state descriptions are complete and\n\u201ctherefore\u201d that the theory is nonlocal. It may well turn\nout that both horns need to be rejected: that the state functions do\nnot provide a complete description and that the theory is also\nnonlocal (although possibly still separable; see Winsberg and Fine\n2003). There is at least one well-known approach to the quantum theory\nthat makes a choice of this sort, the de Broglie-Bohm approach\n (Bohmian Mechanics).\n Of course it may also be possible to break the EPR argument for the\ndilemma plausibly by questioning some of its other assumptions (e.g.,\n separability,\n the reduction postulate, the\n eigenvalue-eigenstate link,\n or measurement independence). That might free up the remaining\noption, to regard the theory as both local and complete. Perhaps some\nversion of the\n Everett Interpretation\n would come to occupy this branch of the interpretive tree, or perhaps\n Relational Quantum Mechanics.\n \n",
