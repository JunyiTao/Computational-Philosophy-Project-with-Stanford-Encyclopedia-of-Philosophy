    "main_text": "The Affects\n2. The Affects\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the affects (affectus) of the human mind\nis a response to one of the central problems for his naturalism. It is\nan attempt to show how the wide range of desires and emotions of the\nhuman mind can be produced by something which follows the order of\nnature. At the start of Part III (see also Chapter 2 of his\nPolitical Treatise), Spinoza notes that traditional accounts\nof the passions, with the exception of Descartes\u2019s, have rested on the\nassumption\u2014one wholly baseless in Spinoza\u2019s view\u2014that\nhuman beings are a separate \u201cdominion\u201d within the dominion of nature,\nwith different kinds of constituents and governed by different sorts\nof laws.  Spinoza\u2019s project continues what he finds to be Descartes\u2019s\nimportant innovation: seeking \u201cto explain human affects through their\nfirst causes.\u201d So his account of the affects may be most profitably\ncompared to Descartes\u2019s in his Passions of the Soul. It may\nalso be usefully compared to accounts in the writings of Hobbes\n(especially Leviathan VI), a contemporary who shared many of\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophical commitments, or to some of the \u201ctraditional\naccounts\u201d which Spinoza faults, such as Aquinas\u2019s Summa\nTheologiae.  (Aquinas\u2019s treatments of the passions appear mainly\nbetween Ia75 and 2a2ae189.)\n\n\nSpinoza, though, because he denies freedom of the will, is more\nthorough than Descartes in his commitment to naturalism. This\ncommitment makes the task Spinoza undertakes in the Ethics an\neven more dramatic revision of traditional understandings of the\npassions than that which Descartes produced. So Spinoza, even more\nthan Descartes, is open to the sort of objection which traditional\nauthors, those to whom it seems beyond question that human beings are\noutside nature, might raise: how can the full range of human\npsychological phenomena be produced by natural causes? For the\nargument of the Ethics to succeed, Spinoza must produce,\nfirst, an account of how human desires and emotions might be a part of\nnature as he has presented it in the Ethics and, second, a\ndescription of those human desires and emotions which is plausibly\ncomplex, that is, plausibly consistent with our experience of\nourselves. The subsections which follow address these issues in turn.\n\n",
