    "main_text": "Political Liberty as Non-Domination || Political Liberty, Positive and Negative\n1.1 Political Liberty, Positive and Negative\n\nIt is notorious that there are several competing conceptions of\npolitical liberty. The now standard account was laid down most\ninfluentially by Isaiah Berlin in his famous lecture on \u201cTwo\nConcepts of Liberty\u201d (Berlin 1969). According to the first,\n\u2018negative\u2019 conception of liberty, people are free simply\nto the extent that their choices are not interfered with. There are\nmany variations on this conception, depending on how exactly one wants\nto define \u2018interference\u2019, but they all have in common the\nbasic intuition that to be free is, more or less, to be left alone to\ndo whatever one chooses. This idea of negative liberty Berlin\nassociates especially with the classic English political philosophers\nHobbes, Bentham, and J. S. Mill, and it is today probably the dominant\nconception of liberty, particularly among contemporary Anglo-American\nphilosophers. In Mill\u2019s well-known words, \u201cthe only\nfreedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in\nour own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of\ntheirs\u201d (1859, 17).\n\nThe second, \u2018positive\u2019 conception of liberty is not quite\nso easy to define. Roughly speaking, a person or group is free in the\npositive sense to the extent that they exercise self-control or\nself-mastery. It is not agreed, however, what exactly constitutes this\nself-mastery in the relevant sense. According to one influential\naccount, to be free in the positive sense is to be able to act on\none\u2019s second-order desires (Frankfurt 1982). For example, the\naddicted gambler may be free in the negative sense not to\ngamble\u2014since no one actually forces him to do so\u2014, but he\nis not free in the positive sense unless he actually succeeds in\nacting on his presumed second-order desire not to desire gambling.\nBerlin associates this second conception especially with such\ncontinental philosophers as Spinoza, Rousseau, and Hegel. Although it\nfound some support among English Hegelians like T. H. Green, those who\nadvocate the positive conception of liberty have generally been in the\nminority, particularly among contemporary Anglo-American\nphilosophers.\n\nThe troubling implications of the positive conception of liberty are\nwell-known, and need not be rehearsed at length here. For the most\npart, these stem from the problem that freedom in the positive sense\nwould seem to license fairly extensive coercion on behalf of\nindividuals\u2019 allegedly \u2018real\u2019 interests\u2014for\nexample, coercively forcing the gambler to quit on the presumption\nthat this is, in fact, what he really wants to do even if he\ndoesn\u2019t say so. Regarding this danger, Berlin writes:\n\nIt is one thing to say that I may be coerced for my own good which I\nam too blind to see: this may, on occasion, be for my benefit\n\u2026. [But] it is another to say that if it is my good, then I am\nnot being coerced, for I have willed it, whether I know this or not,\nand am free (or \u2018truly\u2019 free) even when my poor earthly\nbody and foolish mind bitterly reject it, and struggle against those\nwho seek however benevolently to impose it \u2026. (1969, 134)\n\n\nLiberals like Berlin have thus understandably rejected the\npositive\u00a0and embraced the negative conception of liberty. The\nquestion remains, however, whether the received view of negative\nliberty as non-interference in particular adequately captures the\npolitical ideal we should be most interested in. Contemporary civic\nrepublicans argue that it does not.\n",
