Fights over\nparental rights to control their children\u2019s educations are so\ncontentious precisely because early experiences shape who children\ngrow up to become. Even higher education is taken to have a\ntransformative goal (see Paul & Quiggin 2020). College students\nare typically in their early twenties\u2014the last age at which\npeople tend to undergo radical change before developing fairly stable\npreferences and goals that tend to endure through most of adulthood.\nIn addition, the transformative environment of education shapes more\nthan the individual students who experience it. Students go on to\nbecome members of society who in turn create an environment that will\nshape those who come after them. Morton (2021) points out that this\ntends to have a self-reinforcing effect because elite institutions\nlike the Ivy League schools disproportionately influence social\npolicy. Even if students enter these institutions without the goal of\nmaintaining the status quo of the elite, by the time they graduate,\nthey can be transformed into members of the elite who are now invested\nin safeguarding the interests of their newfound group. This, in turn,\nshapes social policies that reinforce which transformative experiences\nare most readily available to members of society.\n\nThis idea that social policies can shape individual choices and\npreferences creates both an opportunity and a responsibility to\nreconsider which policies ought to be adopted in light of the\npotential for transformative experience. For instance, Pettigrew\n(2023) examines the concept of nudging introduced by Thaler\nand Sunstein (2008). In a nutshell, nudging is a sort of intervention\nthat pushes people toward making a particular choice while leaving\nopen the possibility that they choose otherwise. Opt-out retirement\nprograms offer a paradigm case of nudging since they increase the\nlikelihood that people will put money away for retirement while still\nallowing people the ability to opt-out. Thaler and Sunstein label\nnudging policies as \u201clibertarian paternalism\u201d because\nwhile these interventions look paternalistic, they purportedly help\npeople make the decision that their future idealized selves will deem\nto be best \u201cas judged by themselves\u201d (Thaler and Sunstein 2008, 4). Of course, if the\ndecisions are transformative, or incremental parts of multiple\ndecisions that become transformative, simply looking at the judgment\nof the future self does not seem appropriate at all! (And Pettigrew\nmakes precisely this argument before proposing a modification to the\n\u201cas judged by themselves\u201d test that\u2019s based on his\nweighted general value function.)\n\nThere are at least two bigger-picture issues that come out of this\ndiscussion of nudging people, potentially toward transformation.\nFirst, the norms regarding nudging people toward potential\ntransformation requires further examination. Most policies, nudging or\notherwise, exhibit some degree of interventionism. In addition to\nwhich transformations might be preferable for society as a whole,\nthere\u2019s also the question of whether we should adopt policies\nthat maximize individual autonomy. Second, we might wonder why nudging\nworks in the first place, and if it really does work for\ntransformative experiences. Recall that part of the nature of\ntransformative experiences is that one cannot know what they will be\nlike or how they will change prior to having the experience. Nudging,\non the other hand, only works if these things are somewhat\npredictable. Of course, unpredictability with respect to an individual\nis compatible with predictability with respect to overall social\ntrends. But, if nudging really works, it does lend credence to the\nidea certain elements of transformative experience are predictable and\nperhaps strengthens the case of those from\n \u00a74\n who believe that one can make rational choices with respect to\ntransformative experiences.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ve structured our society in many unfortunate ways.\nThis goes beyond the discrimination that people suffer on the basis of\nrace, sex, ability, socioeconomic status, and the like. More subtle\nconceptual structures shape and limit the way we form our\nself-identities. These injustices are obviously bad in themselves, and\nthey also interact with transformative experience in a way that\nfurthers the injustice. Barnes (2015) argues that one\u2019s\n\u201cself-conception and self-identity aren\u2019t developed in\ncultural isolation\u201d and that \u201csocial norms and structures\nmake certain ways of interpreting or thinking about ourselves readily\navailable\u201d (185). For example, society makes it easy for women\nto \u201cre-shape their self-conception to cohere with the image of a\ndutiful, submissive wife\u201d (186). Similarly, \u201cbrave\ninspiration\u201d is a readily available self-conception for disabled\npeople while \u201cthriving person in an unconventional body\u201d\nis not (185\u2013186). These states of affairs are bad for women and\ndisabled people.  Since personal transformation involves changes to\none\u2019s self-conception, society plays an outsized role in the\ntypes of transformations that are available to us.\n",
