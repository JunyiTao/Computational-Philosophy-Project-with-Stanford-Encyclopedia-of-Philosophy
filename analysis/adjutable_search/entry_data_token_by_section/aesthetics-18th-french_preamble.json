    "main_text": "\n\nFrench philosophers of the Ancien R\u00e9gime wrote treatises on\nbeauty or taste; the term \u201caesthetics\u201d, coined in Latin as\n\u201caesthetica\u201d by German philosopher Alexander\nBaumgarten in 1735 (\u00a7116), was not in popular usage in France and\nappeared only in rare instances at the end of the eighteenth century.\nPhilosophers described taste (\u201cgo\u00fbt\u201d or\n\u201cgoust\u201d) as a sentiment that allowed both\ncreators and consumers to discern the beauty of an object. At times,\nauthors focused more on the object, such as a painting; at other\ntimes, they examined what was happening inside the mind of the person\nwho created it or of the person who looked at it.\n\nEighteenth-century theories of beauty were in many ways a continuation\nof debates that took place during the previous century. The changes\nthat were introduced during the Enlightenment included an increased\nfocus on the mind\u2019s inner workings when perceiving beauty and\nattempts at finding universal standards that could be applied to all\nobjects. These two features are what twentieth-century philosopher\nErnst Cassirer called \u201cempirical\u201d and\n\u201cCartesian\u201d tendencies in eighteenth-century aesthetics.\nIn the second part of the century, major Enlightenment philosophers\nsuch as Voltaire and Diderot claimed that the authority to judge was\nno longer in the hands of worldly amateurs or of little-known\nacademics but in those of professional critics such as themselves.\n\nDebates about artistic matters were greatly influenced by the new\nspaces and means of communication that emerged in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries. Critics expressed their judgments in published\ntreatises and in periodicals such as Le Mercure galant;\nphilosophical ideas were also developed in oral conversations between\nmembers of the newly founded royal academies, within elite coteries in\nprivate salons, and among men in public caf\u00e9s. Discussions\nsometimes even became rowdy in spaces such as the opera house or the\ntheater, which were accessible to people of\u00a0all genders and\nsocial classes. The increasingly literate public called for the right\nto make artistic judgments, while intellectuals were only beginning to\ndistinguish themselves as professionals with institutional\ncredentials, so it is impossible to discuss philosophy in isolation\nfrom milieu or means of communication in the eighteenth century.\n\nMany artistic debates, recorded for posterity as a succession of\nquerelles or quarrels\u2014were highly polemical and often\ndevolved into ad hominem satirical attacks. Among the most\nfamous, one can list the quarrel over the play Le Cid and the\nQuarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, both of which originated in\nthe seventeenth century but which had implications for the next\ncentury. In painting, one could cite the quarrel between fans of\nPoussin, who privileged line, and fans of Rubens, who favored color.\nIn opera, the Querelle des Bouffons pitted most Enlightenment\nphilosophers, who preferred melody and a populist Italian style,\nagainst the fans of composer Rameau, who represented a more erudite\napproach to French harmony.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, discussions of beauty and\ntaste dealt with a variety of objects, including visual arts,\nliterature, music, human bodies, food, and manners. This article will\nconcentrate on the areas that received the most attention from\nwriters: literature and the visual arts. Questions at stake included:\nHow can one define beauty\u2014via the senses, reason, or\nconventional rules? How does the human mind perceive a beautiful\nobject? Who has the right to judge? None of these questions were\ndefinitively answered, but Enlightenment ideas of beauty shaped the\nlegacy of classical French culture, not only for France to this day,\nbut for the whole Western world that it dominated during the\neighteenth century.\n",
