In An Introduction to\nLogical Theory he pioneered what came to be called the\n\u2018analytical solution\u2019, according to which there cannot be\nany question as to the rationality of the employment of induction,\nsince by being rational we mean, amongst other things, using\ninduction. The question whether induction is rational resembles,\naccording to this approach, the question whether the law is legal.\nSince \u2018being legal\u2019 means \u2018being in accordance with\nthe law\u2019, there can be no question about the legality of the\nlaw. This remains a discussed approach. In Individuals he\ntalked of the satisfaction of certain conditions as being criterial\nfor the ascription of some disputed claims, and justified that by\ntranscendental arguments. The Bounds of Sense can be regarded\nas an extended anti-sceptical transcendental argument. Finally, in\nSkepticism and Naturalism he attempts to oppose the sceptic\nby appealing to the inescapability of the claims opposed by the\nsceptic. The unity amongst all these proposals is that the response to\nscepticism is never the production of a proof or demonstration based\non a level of thought external or prior to the discourse in question.\nEach solution aims to turn aside scepticism in some other way.\nStrawson\u2019s ingenuity in devising such responses is very\nimpressive and he is the source of at least three major anti-sceptical\napproaches.\n",
