It is likely that each will think\nof some obvious place to meet, so obvious that each will be sure that\nit is \u201cobvious\u201d to both of them. One does not simply\npredict where the other will go, which is wherever the first predicts\nthe second to predict the first to go, and so ad infinitum.\nNot \u201cWhat would I do if I were she?\u201d but \u201cWhat would\nI do if I were she wondering what she would do if she were wondering\nwhat I would do if I were she \u2026 ?\u201d\n\u2014Thomas Schelling, The Strategy of\nConflict\n\n\nSchelling\u2019s department store problem is an example of a pure\ncoordination problem, that is, an interaction problem in which\nthe interests of the agents coincide perfectly. Schelling (1960) and\nLewis (1969), who were the first to make explicit the role common\nknowledge plays in social coordination, were also among the first to\nargue that coordination problems can be modeled using the analytic\nvocabulary of game theory. A very simple example of such a\ncoordination problem is given in the next figure:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRobert \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\\(s_1\\)\n\\(s_2\\)\n\\(s_3\\)\n\\(s_4\\)  \n\n\nLiz\n\\(s_1\\)\n(4,3)\n(1,2)\n(1,2)\n(3,4) \n\n\\(s_3\\)\n(3,4)\n(1,3)\n(1,3)\n(4,3) \n\n\\(s_3\\)\n(3,4)\n(1,3)\n(1,3)\n(4,3) \n\n\\(s_3\\)\n(3,4)\n(1,3)\n(1,3)\n(4,3)  \n\n\n\\(s_i =\\) search on floor \\(i\\), \\(1 \\leq i \\leq 4\\)\n\nFigure 1.3\n\n\nThe matrix of Figure 1.3 is an example of a game in strategic\nform. At each outcome of the game, which corresponds to a cell in\nthe matrix, the row (column) agent receives as payoff the first\n(second) element of the ordered pair in the corresponding cell.\nHowever, in strategic form games, each agent chooses without first\nbeing able to observe the choices of any other agent, so that all must\nchoose as if they were choosing simultaneously. The Figure 1.3 game is\na game of pure coordination (Lewis 1969), that is, a game in\nwhich at each outcome, each agent receives exactly the same payoff.\nOne interpretation of this game is that Schelling\u2019s spouses, Liz\nand Robert, are searching for each other in the department store with\nfour floors, and they find each other if they go to the same floor.\nFour outcomes at which the spouses coordinate correspond to the\nstrategy profiles \\((s_j, s_j), 1 \\le j \\le 4\\), of the Figure 1.3\ngame. These four profiles are strict Nash equilibria (Nash\n1950, 1951) of the game, that is, each agent has a decisive reason to\nfollow her end of one of these strategy profiles provided that the\nother also follows this\n profile.[7]\n\nThe difficulty the agents face is trying to select an equilibrium to\nfollow. For suppose that Robert hopes to coordinate with Liz on a\nparticular equilibrium of the game, say \\((s_2, s_2)\\). Robert reasons\nas follows: \u201cSince there are several strict equilibria we might\nfollow, I should follow my end of \\((s_2, s_2)\\) if, and only if, I\nhave sufficiently high expectations that Liz will follow her end of\n\\((s_2, s_2)\\). But I can only have sufficiently high expectations\nthat Liz will follow \\((s_2, s_2 )\\) if she has sufficiently high\nexpectations that I will follow \\((s_2, s_2)\\). For her to have such\nexpectations, Liz must have sufficiently high (second-order)\nexpectations that I have sufficiently high expectations that she will\nfollow \\((s_2, s_2)\\), for if Liz doesn\u2019t have these\n(second-order) expectations, then she will believe I don\u2019t have\nsufficient reason to follow \\((s_2, s_2)\\) and may therefore deviate\nfrom \\((s_2, s_2)\\) herself. So I need to have sufficiently high\n(third-order) expectations that Liz has sufficiently high\n(second-order) expectations that I have sufficiently high expectations\nthat she will follow \\((s_2, s_2 )\\), which involves her in\nfourth-order expectations regarding me, which involves me in\nfifth-order expectations regarding Liz, and so on.\u201d What would\nsuffice for Robert, and Liz, to have decisive reason to follow \\((s_2,\ns_2)\\) is that they each know that the other knows\nthat \u2026 that the other will follow \\((s_2, s_2)\\) for any number\nof levels of knowledge, which is to say that between Liz and Robert it\nis common knowledge that they will follow \\((s_2, s_2)\\). If agents\nfollow a strict equilibrium in a pure coordination game as a\nconsequence of their having common knowledge of the game, their\nrationality and their intentions to follow this equilibrium, and no\nother, then the agents are said to be following a\nLewis-convention (Lewis 1969).\n\nLewis\u2019 theory of convention applies to a more general class of\ngames than pure coordination games, but pure coordination games\nalready model a variety of important social interactions. In\nparticular, Lewis models conventions of language as equilibrium points\nof a pure coordination game. The role common knowledge plays in games\nof pure coordination sketched above of course raises further\nquestions: (1) Can people ever attain the common knowledge which\ncharacterizes a Lewis-convention? (2) Would less stringent epistemic\nassumptions suffice to justify Nash equilibrium behavior in a\ncoordination problem?\n",
