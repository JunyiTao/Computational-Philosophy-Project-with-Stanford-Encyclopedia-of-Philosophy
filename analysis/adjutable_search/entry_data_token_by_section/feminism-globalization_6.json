    "main_text": "Issues || Economic Justice\n3.1 Economic Justice\n\nIt is widely argued that neoliberal policies have created dramatic\neconomic inequalities, both between the global North and global South\nand within countries in both hemispheres. One task for feminist\npolitical philosophers has been to identify the ways in which these\npolicies reinforce specific inequalities based on gender, class, race,\nand nationality. In particular, feminists shed light on the disparate\nand often disproportionately burdensome consequences of neoliberal\npolicies for specific groups of women. An additional, related task has\nbeen to identify the ways in which gendered practices and ideologies\nshape the processes of globalization. \n\nFree trade policies feature prominently in such feminist critiques.\nTrade liberalization has led to the wide-scale movement of once\nwell-paying manufacturing jobs in the global North to low wage, export\nprocessing or free trade zones in the global South. In the global\nNorth, the pressure on companies to \u201coutsource\u201d jobs to\ncountries where labor is cheaper and working conditions are less\nregulated has meant that many of the workers who once relied on\nwell-paying manufacturing jobs are now unable to make a living. These\njobs have largely been replaced by contingent and part-time\nservice-sector jobs, which tend to be poorly paid and lack health and\nretirement benefits. The corresponding reduction in real wages has had\na disproportionate effect on women, and especially women of color, who\nhold a higher share of service-sector jobs (Jaggar 2001, 2002a). \n\nIn the global South, foreign-owned manufacturing and assembly\nproduction facilities have proliferated in free trade zones, forming\nwhat is often referred to as the \u201cglobal assembly line.\u201d\nHistorically, foreign-dominated industrial expansion has meant more\njobs for men; however, it is primarily women who comprise the new,\n\u201cinternational, industrial proletariat\u201d working on the\nglobal assembly line. Gendered and racial stereotypes have played an\nimportant role in the establishing this gendered division of labor. In\nparticular, employers tend to perceive women, particularly Asian\nwomen, as \u201ctractable, hard-working, dexterous\u2014and\nsexy\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 305). Governments have been quick to\ncapitalize on these perceptions in their efforts to recruit foreign\ninvestment.\n\nProponents of globalization argue that the expansion of export\nprocessing has had positive consequences for women, providing jobs for\nthousands of otherwise unemployed women and offering new forms of\nagency. However, feminist political philosophers argue that jobs on\nthe global assembly line tend to be difficult, insecure, and\ndangerous: working conditions are poor, hours are long, wages are low,\nand sexual harassment is widespread (Young 2007, 164\u201367). Thus,\nthey contend, the results for women are contradictory at best. As\nJaggar argues, while women\u2019s increased economic power may\nprovide them with some freedom within their families, they are also\n\u201csuper-exploited by foreign corporations with the collusion of\ntheir own governments. As employees, they often experience a type of\nlabor control that is almost feudal in its requirement of subservience\nand dependence\u201d (Jaggar 2001, 306).\n\nTrade liberalization policies have also allowed affluent, northern\ncountries to sell heavily subsidized agricultural products in southern\nmarkets, leading to the decline of small-scale and subsistence\nfarming. Many of the female farmers who have been pushed off their\nland have sought employment in export-processing zones or as seasonal\nlaborers, at lower wages than their male counterparts. Others have\nfound poorly paid and often dangerous jobs in the informal economy\n(Jaggar 2001, 2002a).\n\nFeminist political philosophers are also concerned with the gendered\neffects of structural adjustment policies (SAPs), which many poor\ncountries have been forced to undertake as conditions of borrowing\nmoney or rescheduling their existing debts. The resulting reductions\nin publicly-funded health services, education, and childcare undermine\nthe health and well-being of everyone they affect. However, the\nburdens of SAPs are disproportionately borne by women. Cuts in public\nhealth services have contributed to a rise in maternal mortality. The\nintroduction of school fees has made education unavailable to poorer\nchildren, especially to girls, leading to higher school dropout rates\nfor girls in many southern countries (Kittay 2008). Cuts to other\npublicly funded social services also disproportionately harm women,\nwhose care-giving responsibilities make them more reliant on these\nprograms. Because austerity programs decrease public support for women\nand increase women\u2019s workload, programs like these put women at\ngreater risk for some mental health disorders (Gosselin 2014).\n\nMore broadly, SAPs have contributed to increases in poverty and\nunemployment in developing countries, placing additional burdens on\nwomen within both the household and the public sphere. In times of\neconomic difficulty, men tend to maintain their expenditures, while\nwomen are expected to make ends meet with fewer resources.\nConsequently, women have had to develop survival strategies for their\nfamilies, often picking up the caregiving labor that is no longer\nprovided by the state. Women also face intensified pressure to earn\nincome outside the home. Some women who have been unable to find\nadequate employment in their own countries have turned to labor\nmigration, which we discuss below. Sex work, including child\nprostitution, has also increased under these conditions (Schutte\n2002). \n\nBrock argues that reforming the international tax regime is a matter\nof global gender justice. In her view, global gender justice arises\nonly when all people are able to meet their basic needs, have equal\nprotection for basic liberties, and enjoy fair terms of cooperation in\ncollective endeavors. Because properly funded social and political\ninstitutions are a precondition of gender justice, a fair system of\ninternational taxation and just accounting practices is needed to\nachieve it. Although the claim that international taxation is a\nrequirement of global gender justice might initially seem odd, Brock\nargues that a fair international tax regime is necessary to prevent\nthe harms that women in the global South suffer when public services\nare underfunded. In her view, all corporations should pay their fair\nshare of taxes so countries can fund education, infrastructure\ndevelopment, and programs that promote gender equity. Tax havens which\nallow corporations to evade paying their taxes\u2014so much so that\nfor every dollar of aid that flows into a country, six to seven\ndollars of corporate taxes are evaded\u2014must be eliminated.\nWithout such reforms, we must conclude that the basic institutional\nstructure of the global economy remains unjust and detrimental to\nwomen (Brock 2014).\n",
