Historical Background\n\n\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, southern France (the Midi,\nOccitania, what the Jews called \u201cProvence\u201d) was the most\nactive center of Jewish philosophy. There, in the communities of\nB\u00e9ziers, Carcassonne, Narbonne, Lunel, Montpellier, Arles, and\nMarseilles, Jewish scholars devoted themselves to the translation and\ndissemination of philosophical texts and ideas. During the period\n1148\u20131306 in particular\u2014from the Almohad persecutions in Islamic\nSpain to the expulsion of the Jews from France\u2014much of the\nclassical tradition, as translated into Arabic and developed in the\nIslamic world, was made available in Hebrew. This included works of\nphilosophy and theology, logic and grammar, mathematics, astronomy,\nastrology, and medicine.\n\n\nThe main translators during this period were members of a single\nfamily. Judah Ibn Tibbon (c. 1120\u20131190), a native of Granada,\nresettled in Lunel, where he devoted himself to the translation of\nJudaeo-Arabic works, including texts by Saadia Gaon, Jonah Ibn Janah,\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol, Bahya Ibn Paquda, and Judah Halevi. His son\nSamuel (c. 1165\u20131232) translated Maimonides, and produced the first\nHebrew versions of Aristotle (the Meteorology) and Averroes\n(\u201cThree Treatises on Conjunction,\u201d two by Averroes and one\nby Averroes\u2019 son \u2018Abd Allah). Most prolific was the next\ngeneration of translators. Thus Jacob Anatoli (c. 1194\u20131256), the\nson-in-law and chief disciple of Samuel, translated Ptolemy,\nAverroes\u2019 abridgement of Ptolemy, al-Farghani, and\nAverroes\u2019 middle commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Organon;\nwhile Samuel\u2019s son Moses (fl. 1244\u20131283) translated dozens of\nworks by Euclid, Geminus, Theodosius, Themistius, Hunayn b. Ishaq, Abu\nBakr al-Razi, Ibn al-Haytham, al-Hassar, Ibn al-Jazzar, al-Farabi,\nAvicenna, Ibn al-Sid al-Batalyawsi, Averroes, Jabir Ibn Aflah,\nal-Bitruji, and Maimonides. The last major figure of the family was\nJacob b. Makhir (c.  1236\u20131306), who translated additional works from\nArabic, by Euclid, Menelaus, Autolycus, Theodosius, Qusta b. Luqa, Ibn\nal-Haytham, Ibn al-Saffar, Azarquel, Jabir ibn Aflah, and Averroes. He\nalso seems to have rendered a work from the Latin: a medical text by\nhis contemporary Arnold of Villanova.\n\n\nThe Ibn Tibbon dynasty of translators was instrumental in creating a\nphilosophical library in Hebrew. They also developed a technical\nterminology, which was used by translators, philosophers, and\ncommentators throughout the Middle Ages. Perhaps more significant,\nhowever, were their contributions as original authors. Thus Samuel and\nMoses wrote philosophical commentaries on the Bible and rabbinic\nliterature and philosophical-exegetical monographs, while Jacob\nAnatoli wrote a collection of philosophical sermons. These writings,\ninspired by the work of Maimonides and saturated with the philosophy\nof al-Farabi and Averroes, laid the foundations for a whole\nmovement of Jewish philosophy and exegesis: Maimonideanism. This\nmovement attracted enthusiasts in Provence, as well as in Italy,\nByzantium, and to a lesser extent Spain. It exercised influence and\ncaused controversy throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\nand even into the fifteenth, when Jewish philosophy gradually turned\nto Christian-Latin rather than Graeco-Arabic and Arabic sources for\ninspiration.\n2. Life of Samuel Ibn Tibbon\n\n\nSamuel Ibn Tibbon\u2014the second generation of the Ibn Tibbon\ndynasty\u2014was born in Lunel, a small but very active rabbinic\ncenter in southern France. There\nhis father raised him and educated him according to the ideals of\nIslamic Spain. Thus, in addition to classical Jewish\nsubjects\u2014Hebrew language, Hebrew Bible, and Rabbinic\nliterature\u2014Samuel studied Arabic, philosophy and\nmedicine. Samuel was also introduced to the literary arts, including\ncalligraphy, poetry, and epistolary. But the world of belles lettres\ndid not find favor with the younger Ibn Tibbon; he was far more\ninterested in philosophy than poetry.\n\n\nAlthough Samuel was raised in Lunel, he traveled extensively for\nbusiness and in pursuit of knowledge. During his youth, he visited\nMarseilles with his father in order to engage in commerce. He\ncompleted his translation of the Guide of the Perplexed in\nArles in 1204, consulted manuscripts of the Meteorology in\nToledo and Barcelona (between 1204\u20131210), and traveled twice to\nAlexandria, returning in 1210 and 1213 (while in Egypt he seems to\nhave acquired Maimonides\u2019 \u201cLetter to Yemen\u201d and an\nautograph copy of the Mishneh Torah). By 1211, Samuel\nseems to have moved his primary residence to Marseilles. There Jewish\nsages, on their way to the holy land, visited him in order to consult\nhis translation of the Guide. It was in Marseilles, moreover,\nwhere he taught his son-in-law and most famous disciple Jacob\nAnatoli.\n\n\nDuring his early years, Samuel was influenced primarily by his\nfather. His mature work, in contrast, was built largely upon the\nfoundations of Maimonides. Samuel translated the Guide and\nother writings by Maimonides, and corresponded with the \u201cTrue\nSage\u201d regarding problems of translation and interpretation. In\nfact, much of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s life work was devoted to the explanation\nand dissemination of the teachings of Maimonides. But promoting\nMaimonides meant engaging philosophy more generally as well. Thus he\nacquired extensive knowledge of al-Farabi, cited and discussed\nAvicenna, and was one of the first scholars to make use of Averroes\nand al-Bitruji. There is some evidence that Samuel had contact with\nearly Christian scholasticism as well. This is suggested by the\nsurprising similarity between the interests of Ibn Tibbon and those of\nhis contemporaries, such as Michael Scot and Alfred of Sarashel.\n\n\nOf all the members of the Ibn Tibbon family, Samuel was the most\ninfluential. He was already quoted and eulogized by his contemporary,\nDavid Kimhi, and had decisive impact on the work of his son Moses and\nson-in-law Jacob Anatoli. But his influence is felt elsewhere as well.\nFor example, in thirteenth-century Provence, he was plagiarized by\nGershom b. Solomon, cited and discussed by Levi b. Abraham, and\ndefended by Menahem ha-Meiri. In Italy, his writings were consulted\nand commented upon by Moses of Salerno, Zerahyah b. Isaac b. Shealtiel\nHen, Judah Romano, and especially Immanuel of Rome, who excerpted\nlarge sections from Ibn Tibbon\u2019s writings and incorporated them into\nhis commentaries on the Bible. So important was Ibn Tibbon\u2019s work that\nhe was singled out by the opponents of philosophy. Thus Jacob b.\nSheshet wrote a full-length critique of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s Ma\u2019amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim, while Solomon b. Abraham of Montpellier \u2014\nthe main anti-Maimonidean activist during the Maimonidean controversy\nof the 1230s \u2014 accused him of revealing the secrets of\nthe Guide to the uninitiated.  In the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries, Ibn Tibbon was second to none as Maimonidean\nauthority in philosophy and philosophical exegesis.\n3. Translations\n\n\nThe primary occupation of Samuel Ibn Tibbon was translator. This is\nwhat he was trained to be by his father. His most famous translation\nis the Guide of the Perplexed.  But he also translated other\nworks by Maimonides, and produced the first Hebrew versions of\nAristotle and Averroes. A brief description of each of the\ntranslations will be given here.\n\n\n1. Maimonides, Commentary on the Mishnah, Avot\n\nThe first major translation of Maimonides by Ibn Tibbon was the\ncommentary on Avot, which was completed, according to the manuscript,\nin 1202. Ibn Tibbon translated the commentary proper together with\nMaimonides\u2019 introduction, entitled \u201cEight Chapters.\u201d\nThe preface in particular, consisting of an introduction to and\nadaptation of Aristotelian ethics, would become the standard\nintroduction to philosophical ethics in Hebrew throughout the later\nMiddle Ages.\n\n\n2. Maimonides, \u201cTreatise on Resurrection\u201d\n\nIt seems that the \u201cTreatise on Resurrection\u201d was\ntranslated into Hebrew during the resurrection controversy\n(1202\u20131204), when Maimonides was accused of denying this religious\ndogma. Ibn Tibbon translated it, and, it seems, sent it to Toledo,\nwhere it was retranslated into Arabic and translated afresh by Judah\nal-Harizi into a more fluid and readable Hebrew style.\n\n\n3. Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed\n\nIbn Tibbon began to work on this translation already in the 1190s,\ncorresponded with Maimonides regarding problems of translation and\ninterpretation, produced a first edition in 1204, and a revised version,\nwith glossary (Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot), in 1213. The\ntranslation itself generally circulated with the glossary, together\nwith Ibn Tibbon\u2019s marginal annotations, an introduction on\ntranslation, and other study aids and ad hoc discussions.\n\n\n4. Maimonides, \u201cLetter on Translation\u201d\n\nWhile working on the translation of the Guide, Ibn Tibbon\ncorresponded with Maimonides, but only one letter by Maimonides\nsurvives. This letter is a complex text, which includes a brief\nintroduction, discussion of problems in translation, a description of\nhis busy life in Fustat, and recommendations for philosophical\nreading.  The letter was originally written in Arabic, but survives\nonly in several Hebrew translations, one of which was rendered by Ibn\nTibbon himself. This translation also includes Ibn Tibbon\u2019s own\n(often critical) remarks on Maimonides\u2019 suggested renderings of\ndifficult Arabic terms.\n\n\n5. Aristotle, Meteorology\n\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s translation of the Meteorology was completed,\naccording to a manuscript colophon, in 1210, while returning by boat\nfrom Alexandria. In the preface, he discusses the problems of\ntranslating this work: the subject was difficult, the Arabic\ntranslation obscure, and the manuscripts corrupt. Thus he consulted\nmanuscripts in Barcelona and Toledo in order to help reconstruct the\noriginal. He also examined the commentaries on it by Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Avicenna, and Averroes\u2014for textual witnesses and to\nhelp understand the text. In some cases, he incorporated translations\nfrom the commentators into the translation itself. Ibn Tibbon\u2019s\npreface to the translation includes the beginnings of a lexicon,\nperhaps part of a larger project, which was never completed or was\nincorporated into his larger glossary (to be discussed below).\n\n\nWhy did Ibn Tibbon translate the Meteorology before any other\nwork by Aristotle? It seems that he did this in response to a remark made\nby Maimonides in Guide 2:30\u2014that Meteorology\nis the key to understanding the \u201caccount of the beginning\u201d\nin Genesis, chapter 1.\n\n\n6. Averroes and \u2018Abd Allah, \u201cThree Treatises on\nConjunction\u201d\n\nThe translation of three short treatises on conjunction with the\nactive intellect by Averroes and Averroes\u2019 son \u2018Abd Allah\nwas also a pioneering project. They were the first works of Averroes\nrendered into Hebrew, before any of the commentaries on Aristotle. Ibn\nTibbon translated them and attached them to his commentary on\nEcclesiastes. He did this, he maintained, because Averroes and Solomon\nwere aiming to do precisely the same thing: to defend the doctrine of\nconjunction against skeptics who denied that it was possible.\n\n\nThese translations, therefore, like the Meteorology, had\nstrong exegetical significance. But they were read in their own right\nas well. They circulated independently of the commentary on\nEcclesiastes, and became standard textbooks in the discussion of\nimmortality. Thus, for example, they were included in Gershom b.\nSolomon\u2019s encyclopedic work Sha\u2018ar ha-Shamayim,\nwere commented on by Gersonides, and were incorporated into Hanokh b.\nSolomon al-Konstantini\u2019s Marot Elohim. A composite\nLatin version, based on the Hebrew, circulated under the title De\nanimae beatitudine.\n\n\n7. Maimonides, \u201cLetter to Yemen\u201d \n\nThe last known translation by Ibn Tibbon is Maimonides\u2019\n\u201cLetter to Yemen.\u201d This text he seems to have acquired\nwhile in Egypt; and he translated it into Hebrew circa 1214. Why he\ntranslated this text is not known. But it seems that it did not\ncirculate widely. Thus already in the 1230s Abraham ibn Hasdai found\nit necessary to produce a fresh translation of the work, since he\ncould not find a copy of the rendering by his predecessor.\n\n\n8. Other translations\n\nIbn Tibbon incorporated translations and summaries of Arabic texts\ninto his original writings as well. This is true in the glossary\nattached to the Guide (Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot),\nhis commentary on Ecclesiastes, and Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim. Three of the most important examples are the\nfollowing:\n\n\n8.1 Al-Farabi, Short Summary of Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and\nAristotle\u2019s Categories\n\nThe first entry in Ibn Tibbon\u2019s glossary is the definition of\nthe ten categories and five predicables. Most of the text presented\nthere is a word-for-word translation from al-Farabi.\n\n\n8.2 Al-Bitruji, Principles of Astronomy\n\nIn the glossary, commentary on Ecclesiastes, and Ma\u2019amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn Tibbon presents a brief summary of\nal-Bitruji\u2019s astronomy; these were the first appearances of\nBitruji\u2019s novel theories in Hebrew. In the following generation,\nthe entire text of al-Bitruji was translated by Samuel\u2019s son\nMoses.\n\n\n8.3 Avicenna, Kitab al-Shifa\u2019, Meteorology\n\nIn the third chapter of Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn\nTibbon presents a partial translation of a section from Avicenna\u2019s\nShifa\u2019 on mountain formation. The theory of\nAvicenna\u2014that erosion is prevented by the mixture of mud with\nfatty oils\u2014contributed to Ibn Tibbon\u2019s discussion there of\neternity of the world and the possibility of spontaneous\ngeneration.\n\n\n9. Spurious and doubtful translations\n\nMany other translations are attributed to Ibn Tibbon in manuscripts,\nmanuscript catalogues, and later sources. Most are clearly spurious;\nbut two are worth mentioning. Isaac Abarbanel refers to a translation\nby Ibn Tibbon of Maimonides\u2019 introduction to chapter ten of\nMishnah Sanhedrin, but this translation does not survive. An anonymous\ntranslation of the text, published by Kupfer, is clearly not his work.\nThe second is a translation of \u2018Ali b. Ridwan\u2019s commentary on\nGalen\u2019s Ars parva. According to the colophon, this\ntranslation was completed by Ibn Tibbon in B\u00e9ziers in 1199. If\nthis attribution were correct, it would contribute important\ninformation to Ibn Tibbon\u2019s biography. It would also establish the\nvery early existence of an Arabic medical text in Hebrew. The\ntranslation itself, however, uses terms such as nirdaf for\nsynonym that were not part of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s translation lexicon. If it\nis his work it was done much later or revised by a later hand\n(cf. Freudenthal and Fontaine).\n4. Method of Translation\n\n\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s translations are generally literal. Unlike Judah\nal-Harizi, his rival translator, he was not concerned with felicity of\nstyle or purity of language but accuracy in meaning. Thus he uses\nrabbinic as well as biblical expressions, follows the syntax of the\nArabic, and coins new terms, based on the model of the Arabic. He was\ncriticized for this method\u2014by al-Harizi and others\u2014but it\nwas his method and terminology that ultimately won out and became\nauthoritative throughout the later middle ages.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon discusses the problems and difficulties of translation in\nseveral texts: The preface to the translation of the Guide,\nthe prologue to his \u201cLetter on Providence,\u201d the preface to\nthe glossary and the glossary itself, the preface to\nMeteorology, and the commentary on Ecclesiastes. What I would\nlike to do here is present a brief synthetic characterization of Ibn\nTibbon\u2019s method of translation based on these sources. This subject is\nimportant for understanding the work of Ibn Tibbon and the process of\ncreating a philosophical culture in Hebrew.  Translating philosophy,\nmoreover, is a philosophical subject in its own right.\n\n\n1. Editing the text, comparing manuscripts\n\n\nThe first order of business in translating a text is the preparation\nof a reliable edition. Thus Ibn Tibbon, as critical scholar, made\nevery effort to collect and compare manuscripts of the texts on which\nhe worked. For example, in a brief introduction to his \u201cLetter\non Providence,\u201d he describes his efforts to eliminate\ncorruptions in his manuscript of the Guide by acquiring\nadditional copies and comparing them to his Vorlage. In the preface to\nthe Meteorology, similarly, he indicates that he had\nconsulted manuscripts of Aristotle\u2019s work in Toledo and Barcelona, and\nhad studied the commentaries by Alexander, Avicenna, and Averroes, in\norder to help construct a more reliable text closer to the\noriginal.\n\n\n2. Consulting Arabic dictionaries\n\n\nIn the preface to the translation of the Guide, Ibn Tibbon\nexplains that, when confronted with difficult terms, he would consult\nArabic dictionaries. He does not say which dictionaries he consulted,\nbut a report by Todros Todrosi, in the preface to his\nfourteenth-century translation of Averroes\u2019 Middle Commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric (ed. J. Goldenthal, Leipzig, 1842,\np. 3), provides an exact reference: al-Khalil b. Ahmad\u2019s\nKitab al-\u2018ayn. Todrosi\u2019s report reads as\nfollows:\n\n\nThere was not sufficient power in our knowledge of the Arabic\nlanguage to produce this translation until God graced me with a\nnoble book which includes explanations of each Arabic word and its\ngrammar. It is called Sefer ha-\u2018Ayin. It is a book that\nthe noble sage, the greatest of translators, Rabbi Samuel Ibn Tibbon,\nmay his memory be for a blessing, made great effort to bring from\nIslamic lands.\n\n\n3. Consulting previous translations\n\n\nIn the preface to the translation of the Guide, Ibn Tibbon\nexplains that, in his translation of Maimonides, he had consulted\nprevious translations, rendered by his father and by others. Moreover,\nhe explains that, when a term already exists, he will follow\nestablished convention, even when he disagrees. One example of this\nambivalent deference to tradition is his definition of\n\u201clogic\u201d in the glossary. The text (from Perush\nha-Millot ha-Zarot, ed. Even-Shemuel, pp. 43-4; corrected by\nHebrew MS London 904, 164b) reads as follows:\n\n\nLogic [higgayon]: Some commentators have\nexplained [the rabbinic phrase] \u2018keep your children from\nhiggayon\u2019 [Ber. 28b] as referring to the\nscience called mantiq in Arabic. The Christians call it\n\u2018dialectic,\u2019 [referring to the discipline as a whole] with\nthe name of one of its parts. I have followed the commentators [with\nrespect to this terminology] and call [logic] the \u2018art of\nhiggayon.\u2019 But in my view it would have been better had\nthey called it the \u2018art of speech,\u2019 following their\nopinion according to which they define man as \u2018living and\nspeaking.\u2019 Indeed, in my opinion, [logic] ought to be called the\n\u2018art of reason\u2019.\n\n\n4. The use of Saadia\u2019s Tafsir\n\n\nAnother important source of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s translations is the\nArabic translation of the Bible by Saadia Gaon. This presented a ready\nlexicon of sorts for the translator: he could identify the Arabic term\nin Saadia\u2019s Tafsir and replace it with the biblical term it\ntranslated. One example of Ibn Tibbon doing exactly this is found in\nhis glossary, in his discussion of the terms \u201cdefinition\u201d\nand \u201cdescription.\u201d His discussion, as found in the\nmanuscript versions (see Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot, ed.\nEven-Shemuel, pp. 24-5, corrected by Hebrew MS London 904, 161b), is\nas follows:\n\n\nHaving explained the meaning of these five words [namely, the five\npredicables], I will attach to them the explanation of two additional\nterms, namely, geder, \u2018definition,\u2019 and\nhoq, \u2018description\u2019 \u2026 As for the term\nhoq, I do not remember having seen this term used in this way\nby any [previous translator], but I have seen that Rabbenu Saadia\ntranslated the biblical term hoq, as in the phrase hoq\nu-mishpat, \u2018a statute and an ordinance\u2019 [see\ne.g. Exod 15:25], as rasm; and similarly he translated\nhuqqay as rus\u00fbm\u00ee [see e.g. Ps\n50:16]. Because of this, I have translated the Arabic term\nrasm into Hebrew as hoq.\n\n\n5. Consultations with the author\n\n\nWhen all else failed\u2014after consulting dictionaries and previous\ntranslations\u2014Ibn Tibbon addressed his queries to the author\nhimself.  In fact, there is evidence that Ibn Tibbon wrote at least\nthree letters to Maimonides regarding translation and interpretation,\nand that he received at least two letters in response. But only Ibn\nTibbon\u2019s \u201cLetter on Providence\u201d (which was mentioned\nbriefly above), and Maimonides\u2019 \u201cLetter on\nTranslation\u201d survive.  Notable about the latter is that, despite\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s efforts to consult with Maimonides, he generally\nignored the latter\u2019s advice, and continued to follow the\ntranslation terminology and traditions of his father.\n\n\n6. Coining new terms\n\n\nOne of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s most interesting discussions of translation\nis found in his preface to the glossary. There he lists and discusses\nsix types of \u201cstrange\u201d or \u201cforeign\u201d terms used\nin his translation of the Guide: neologisms, rare words or\nphrases, derived terms, homonyms, terms created through calque, and\nnew compound expressions. In the preface to the commentary on\nEcclesiastes, he then provides a rare description of how he actually\ncoined a new term through calque. This description reads as\nfollows:\n\n\nHaving mentioned the inductive syllogism, I shall explain what I mean\nby \u2018induction,\u2019 when I use it here and elsewhere. I say:\nit seems to me that the philosophers borrowed the Arabic word, which I\nreplace with the Hebrew hippus, from the language of the\nmultitude, who use it to express a notion that resembles what the\nphilosophers intend when they use it. The notion for which the\nmultitude use this word, namely, istiqr\u00e2\u2019, is as\nfollows. They say: \u2018I have examined [istaqraytu] a\ncertain land,\u2019 that is, I have traveled through all of it,\nseeing the character [\u2018inyan] of each of its villages\nand cities. The philosophers then borrowed [this same term] to\nrepresent the examination [haqirah] of a single universal by\nknowing the intention [\u2018inyan] of each of its parts and\nspecies.  They called such an action istiqr\u00e2\u2019,\nderived a verb from it, and constructed whatever [grammatical forms]\nthey desired.  They said: \u2018I have examined\nall of the particulars that are subsumed under a certain\nuniversal,\u2019 that is, I have used the speculative method to pass\nthrough all of them, knowing in this way the intention\n[\u2018inyan] of each of them. I did not find a single word\nin our language closer to this meaning than hippus, even\nthough the Arabic word, unlike the Hebrew hippus, implies not\nonly the examination of a notion but knowledge of the notion\nexamined.\n\n\n7. Defense of translation\n\n\nAfter completing the first version of the Guide, Judah\nal-Harizi produced a rival translation, apparently at the request of\nsome sages from southern France. al-Harizi\u2019s translation was\nwritten elegantly and in Biblical Hebrew; its goal was to be readable\nand accessible. Ibn Tibbon issued his revised translation, with\nglossary, in response to this challenge. Thus in the preface to the\nglossary he focuses on defending his own work and undermining the work\nof his rival. He exposes al-Harizi\u2019s ignorance of philosophy and\nhighlights his own mastery of the subject matter of the Guide\nand sensitivity to the difficulties of translation.\n\n\nIn the preface to the commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon also\nseems to provide explanation why the literal translation of\nphilosophical texts is superior. There he emphasizes the importance of\nword order in the construction of meaning. Drawing from the rhetorical\ntradition of \u201cdelivery,\u201d he likens a written text to a\nspeech: it uses certain literary devices to imitate gesture, voice,\nand facial expression. The text, describing the method of transmitting\nwisdom through \u201cchapter headings,\u201d reads as follows:\n\n\n[This method of teaching through \u2018chapter headings\u2019] can\nbe done orally and in person; it may even be easy for sages and men of\nunderstanding to do this; for the wise instructor has available many\nstratagems, digressions, and circumlocutions with which he can make\nthe understanding student understand his purpose, even when his\npurpose is not made clear or explained. But he cannot do this when\nwriting in a book. A man, for example, might say to his associate:\n\u2018you did really well when you did that thing,\u2019 while the\nperson addressed will understand that in the former\u2019s opinion\nwhat he did was really bad. This he understands not from the words\nthemselves, which are contrary to the speaker\u2019s purpose, but\nfrom certain affectations and accidents of speech, such as the\nappearance of the speaker\u2019s face, which may become red or green\nlike that of an angry man, or his tone of voice; that is, rather than\nsaying something in a gentle tone, in accordance with the manners of\nspeech used by someone speaking straightforward, such a person would\nspeak [using the tone] of someone who is speaking about something that\nhe considers bad. [The listener can also understand his\ninterlocutor\u2019s purpose] from other things that [the speaker]\nmight attach to the words or attach the words thereto. Many examples\nof this type have been enumerated by the logicians.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon proceeds to discuss the ways to do this in a written\ntext, using rhetorical and poetic devices. The implication for\ntranslation is as follows: any change in the form of a text will have\nserious impact on its meaning.\n5. Reference Tools and Study Aids\n\n\nAl-Harizi was right about one thing: that Ibn Tibbon\u2019s literal\ntranslations are difficult to read. But even if they were elegant and\naccessible, reading the Guide, and other translated texts,\nwould require background in philosophy. This Ibn Tibbon recognized.\nThus he did far more than simply producing literal translations; he\nalso initiated the creation of a cognate literature in Hebrew:\nphilosophical reference works and study aids. He produced the first\nmajor lexicon of philosophical Hebrew; and he included explanatory\nglosses in the margins of his translation of the Guide, which\nestablished the foundation for a proper commentary tradition. A brief\ndiscussion of the glossary will be given here.\n\n\nThe philosophical glossary or lexicon is, in fact, a very old genre.\nThe tradition of defining key terms was developed already in late\nantiquity, and continued into the Middle Ages. For example, al-Kindi,\nAvicenna, and Isaac Israeli all wrote books of definitions.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot was the first\nmajor philosophical lexicon written in Hebrew. It was written not as a\ngeneral introduction to philosophy, like the work of his predecessors,\nbut as a glossary to one translated text: Maimonides\u2019 Guide\nof the Perplexed. In fact, however, it is much more. It includes\nextended discussions of key terms, and works as both glossary and\nlexicon, introduction and primer. Many philosophical ideas appear in\nHebrew for the first time in the glossary; and there is evidence that\nthe text itself was studied independently, as a general reference work\nor study aid.\n\n\nIn order to illustrate its character, I\u2019ll present here four\nentries from the glossary: rhetorical statement, natural science (or\nphysics), divine science (or metaphysics), and mathematics. With these\nfour entries, Ibn Tibbon introduced his Hebrew reader to the entire\nAristotelian curriculum as it had developed in the Arabic world\n(including pseudo-Aristotelian works).\n\n\n1. Rhetorical Statement [Ma\u2019amar Haggadi]:\n\n\nKnow that there are five types of syllogism; Aristotle wrote a book\nabout each. The first is the demonstrative syllogism, in which\nsomething is deduced from true premises. He called [his book on this\ntype of syllogism] the \u201cBook on Demonstration\u201d\n[=Posterior Analytics]. The second is the dialectical\nsyllogism, in which something is deduced from generally accepted\npremises. He called [his book on this type of syllogism] the\n\u201cBook on Dispute and Victory\u201d [=Topics]. The\nthird type is the rhetorical syllogism, in which the premises are\nconvincing, that is, they convince the masses of their truth such that\nthey believe in them. These are inferior to the generally accepted\npremises; and they are certainly inferior to the demonstrative. He\ncalled [his book on this type of syllogism] \u201cRhetoric.\u201d\nWith this type of statement or syllogism, moreover, one preaches to\nthe people in order to incite them to do something or refrain from\ndoing something or to fix in their hearts the love of something such\nthat they approach it or the hatred of something such that they remove\nthemselves from it. A statement of this type is called\n\u201crhetorical statement,\u201d just as a statement of the first\ntype is called \u201cdemonstrative statement\u201d and one of the\nsecond is called \u201cdialectical statement.\u201d The fourth is\nthe poetic syllogism, in which the premises are such that they create\nan image in the heart of whoever hears them. This image leads such a\nperson to love or hate something, even when he knows that there is no\ntruth in those statements. He called [his book on this type of\nsyllogism] \u201cPoetics.\u201d The fifth [type of syllogism] is the\nsophistical syllogism, of which there are two types: a) the premises\nthemselves are sophistical, that is, although they appear to be true,\nwhen they are examined carefully by a scholar he finds that one or\nboth are false; b) although the premises are true, their combination\ndoes not generate a [true] conclusion, even though it seems to do\nso. This second type will deceive anyone who fails to examine [the\nconclusion] carefully or who is not an expert with regard to all of\nthe conditions of syllogisms. The name of the book concerning this,\nthe fifth, type of syllogism is the \u201cBook of Sophistry;\u201d\nit is the book called in Arabic al-Safsata and in Romance\nSofistica. These [five] works were prefaced by Aristotle with\nhis \u201cBook on Syllogism\u201d [=Prior Analytics], in\nwhich he discusses all of them and makes known [in general] the\nconditions and properties of the syllogism.\n\n\n2. Natural Science (Physics):\n\n\nThe Master [Maimonides] has indicated that this is what the Sages\ncalled the \u201caccount of the beginning.\u201d He meant by this\nthat the secrets of the \u201caccount of the beginning\u201d\nrepresent chapter headings in natural science, which is the science\nthat investigates all aspects of things that are governed by nature,\ni.e., all celestial and sublunary bodies and their accidents. The final\nsource of all books in this science are those written by Aristotle.\nThese include the following: 1) \u201cThe Discourses on Nature\u201d\n[=Physics], in which natural things are discussed in general.\n2) \u201cOn the Heavens and the World,\u201d in which the spheres,\nplanets, and stars, along with the four elements and their mixtures,\nare discussed in general. 3) \u201cOn Generation and\nCorruption,\u201d in which the causes of generation and corruption,\ntheir attributes and quiddity, are discussed in particular. 4)\n\u201cThe Signs of Heaven\u201d [=Meteorology], in which\naccidents and things that come into existence in the upper part of the\natmosphere are discussed; some of these things, when they come into\nexistence, are also found on land or in the sea. 5) \u201cOn Minerals\nand Stones,\u201d in which their quiddity and quality are discussed.\n6) \u201cOn Plants,\u201d in which the nature of every thing that\nexperiences growth is discussed. 7) \u201cOn Animals,\u201d in which\nall accidents which affect both rational and irrational animals are\ndiscussed, as well as the utility of their limbs. 8) \u201cOn the\nSoul,\u201d in which the faculties of the human soul are discussed in\ngeneral. 9) \u201cOn Sense and Sensibilia\u201d [=Parva\nnaturalia], in which the nature of the senses in particular, as\nwell as sleep and being awake, are discussed. As for the chapter\nheadings set forth in the biblical section on Genesis, they cover only\na small portion of what is contained in these books: not one in a\nhundred or even one in two hundred\u2026\n\n\n3. Divine Science (Metaphysics):\n\n\nA science which discusses that which has no nature, i.e., things that\nare intellectual and separate from matter, like the Lord, His angels,\nand other things that derive from the actions of the intellect and\nfrom the knowledge of the intellect\u2014they have no action in the\nsense world. The root of all books in this science is\nAristotle\u2019s book called \u201cMetaphysics.\u201d\n\n\n4. Mathematics:\n\n\nKnow that the demonstrative sciences have three divisions: natural\nscience, mathematics, and divine science. We have already explained\nthe first and the last. As for the second, namely mathematics, it\nincludes geometry, arithmetic, astronomy\u2014which includes the\nstudy of the spheres and planets and the judgments of the planets\n[=astrology]\u2014and the science of melody, which is called\n\u201cmusic.\u201d The three terms \u201cmathematics,\u201d\n\u201cpropadeutic\u201d and \u201ctraining\u201d are synonyms used\nfor this division of science; for it is like a science that trains,\nteaches, or serves the other two divisions.\n6. Philosophy and Exegesis\n\n\nIbn Tibbon wrote two main original works: A commentary on Ecclesiastes\nand a philosophical-exegetical monograph entitled Ma\u2019amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim. He also wrote introductions to his\ntranslations, letters to Maimonides, and a short treatise on the\n\u201cReason for the Table and Shewbread.\u201d In addition to these\nworks, which are extant, he planned two other commentaries as well,\nwhich were never completed: A commentary on the internal meanings of\nProverbs and an esoteric commentary on Genesis, entitled Ner\nha-Hofes (see Prov 20:27).\n\n\nWhat is the character of these writings? Although they are diverse\nin form and content, they all share two main characteristics: they\ndiscuss philosophical ideas in the form of biblical exegesis; and they\nbuild upon discussions of verses and rabbinic dicta found in the\nGuide and borrow and apply methods developed by the\nGuide. Any discussion of Ibn Tibbon, therefore, needs to work\nthrough a complex philosophical-exegetical process: from the Bible,\nto rabbinic literature, to Maimonides; and from Maimonides, through\nrabbinic literature, to the Bible.\n\n\nWhy did Ibn Tibbon write his philosophy in this way? Why didn\u2019t he\nwrite straightforward philosophical or theological summas or\ncommentaries on philosophical works by Aristotle or Averroes?  In the\nthirteenth century, much of the philosophical activity in the Jewish\ncommunities was focused not on general synthesis but on translation,\ntransmission, defense, and propagation; and teaching philosophy within\nthe framework of traditional literature was a very effective way of\nspreading the ideas of philosophy. In particular, teaching philosophy\nthrough Bible (or rabbinic literature) helped make foreign ideas more\nfamiliar and helped justify the study of philosophy by connecting it\nwith authoritative exemplars. Most important, it created a safe place\nfor the doing of philosophy itself; for through a peculiar process of\ncanonization, beginning with Maimonides and continuing with his\ndisciples, specific biblical verses or stories became the standard\nloci for the discussion of philosophical ideas or problems. The\nbiblical texts would stay the same, but the philosophical ideas would\nchange, in light of the novel ideas of a particular exegete or school\nof thought.\n\n\nIn order to give a sense of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s philosophical exegesis,\nI\u2019ll briefly describe his original writings, then single out a\nfew specific examples relating to a single problem: the final aim of\nhuman existence.\n\n\n1. The Preface to the translation of Maimonides, Commentary on\nAvot\n\nIn the preface to this translation, Ibn Tibbon presents a full and\ndetailed explication of Jeremiah 9:22\u201323. He explains and criticizes\nMaimonides\u2019 explanation of these verses in Guide 3:54\nand offers his own novel interpretation, according to which the final\naim of man is knowledge and understanding of God, and nothing more\n(see further discussion below).\n\n\n2. The Commentary on Ecclesiastes\n\nIt seems that this was Ibn Tibbon\u2019s first major exegetical work;\nit was likely completed sometime between 1213 and 1221. The commentary\nis a large and digressive work, including a long preface, a\nverse-by-verse commentary, and several digressions, in which Ibn\nTibbon introduces a philosophical subject or explains a related verse\nin Genesis, Jeremiah, Psalms, Proverbs, or the Song of Songs. The\nphilosophical digressions are mainly related to logic, astronomy,\nmeteorology, generation and corruption, celestial influence on the\nsublunar world, and the soul and its faculties.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s understanding of Ecclesiastes as a whole is as follows:\nSolomon wrote the book in his youth in order to refute ancient\nskeptics who denied the possibility of immortality (\u201cconjunction\nwith the active intellect\u201d). This he did by carefully examining\nthe arguments against immortality in order to show that they are not\n\u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201ccogent\u201d or\n\u201cdecisive.\u201d The three arguments he refutes are the\nfollowing: that human intellect is intellect in matter, and therefore\ncannot become separate from matter or contemplate separate substances;\nthat the intellect, even though it derives from an incorporeal giver\nof forms, still requires a corporeal substrate; that ethics is a first\nrather than final perfection, and cannot save the human being from\ndeath and destruction.\n\n\n3. Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim\n\nThe title of this work might be translated as: \u201cTreatise on [the\nVerse]: Let the waters be gathered (Gen 1:9)\u201d or: \u201cThe\n[Divine] Saying: Let the waters be gathered (Gen 1:9)\u201d. It was\ncompleted after the commentary on Ecclesiastes, possibly in 1221 or\n1231. Like the commentary on Ecclesiastes, it is digressive and\nexegetical, although in general it follows the order of Guide of\nthe Perplexed, part III. Ibn Tibbon begins this work with a\ncosmological question\u2014why is the earth not covered entirely by\nwater\u2014and then proceeds to answer this and related questions in\nrelation to verses from Genesis, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Job, and especially\nthe Book of Psalms.\n\n\n4. \u201cThe Reason for the Table and Shewbread\u201d\n\nThis short treatise was occasioned by a statement in Guide of the\nPerplexed 3:45. There Maimonides says that, although he can\nexplain most aspects of the sacrificial cult, he cannot explain the\nreason for the table and shewbread. Ibn Tibbon thus takes up this\nchallenge from the Master. He explains that the table and shewbread,\nand the very sensuous sacrificial cult in general, serves as a lesson\nin theology. In particular, the gross anthropomorphic representations,\nin Ibn Tibbon\u2019s opinion, expose the absurdity of conceiving God as a\nbody, with all the body\u2019s concomitant needs and relations. In other\nwords, the temple and tabernacle, working as a reductio ad absurdum of\nsorts, helped to spread the true belief in monotheism.\n\n\n5. Commentary on the Internal Meanings of Proverbs\n\nIn the commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon says that he planned a\ncommentary on the internal meanings of Proverbs. Although this\ncommentary was never written, it is possible that preliminary\ndiscussions were incorporated into his other writings. Thus in the\ncommentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon presents a full and detailed\nverse-by-verse explication of Prov 1:1-7 and 8:22-36. The former he\nexplains as a prooemium, following the philosophical tradition of\nwriting prefaces: Solomon introduces the title of the work, the name\nof the author, the method of presentation, etc. The latter verses he\nexplains in relation to the possibility of repentance: of sinning,\nrepenting, and returning to the Garden of Eden.\n\n\n6. Ner ha-Hofes: An Esoteric Commentary on Genesis\n\nIn Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn Tibbon refers several\ntimes to this book, which he says is a work in progress. It was never\ncompleted, but as with the commentary on Proverbs, it is possible that\npreliminary notes and explanations can be found in his other writings.\nThus, for example, the commentary on Ecclesiastes includes several\ndetailed explications of verses from Genesis, including 1:11, 1:14,\n1:20, 1:26, 3:22\u201324, 8:21\u201322. Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, moreover, includes one chapter devoted to Gen 28\n(Jacob\u2019s ladder), one to Gen 11 (the tower of Babel), and discussion\nthroughout regarding Gen 1 and the \u201caccount of the\nbeginning.\u201d\n7. Examples of Philosophical Exegesis\n\n\nThroughout Ibn Tibbon\u2019s writings, he returns time and again to a\nfew key problems: divine providence, the possibility of immortality,\nand the final aim of human existence. These subjects were particularly\nvexing: Maimonides had discussed them, but did not provide a consistent\ndoctrine; al-Farabi had famously denied that conjunction is possible;\nwhile Averroes took up the question of immortality in several works\nwith differing results. Ibn Tibbon, for his part, worked with the\nbiblical texts singled out by Maimonides, but developed ideas drawn\nfrom al-Farabi and Averroes. His discussion of three biblical texts,\nall relating to the final aim of human existence, are especially\nimportant. His interpretations will be presented here in relation to\nthose of Maimonides.\n\n\n1. Genesis 28:12\u201313\n\n\nAnd he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top\nof it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and\ndescending on it; and behold, the Lord stood above it, and said: I am\nthe God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. \n\n\nIn the preface to the Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides\nsingles out Jacob\u2019s vision of the ladder in Gen 28 as a paradigmatic\nexample of the biblical allegory; he isolates seven key terms in the\nstory, which he decodes, in two different ways, in later chapters of\nthe Guide. Thus the angels ascending and descending the\nladder are explained in Guide 1:15 as prophets; they ascend\nthrough study and descend, with divine wisdom in hand, to govern the\npeople. In Guide 2:10, in contrast, the vision is explained\nin relation to cosmology rather than politics and prophecy. The ladder\nis set up on the earth and extends into the celestial realm, the rungs\non the ladder are the four elements or seven celestial bodies, and the\nangels ascending and descending are the celestial intelligences. The\nLord, standing firmly at the top of the ladder, is God as first cause\nor prime mover.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon was the first philosopher-exegete to build upon Maimonides\u2019\napproach and to move it in new directions, which were more consistent\nwith his own particular interests. Thus in Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, chapter 11, he emphasized the epistemological and\ncosmological and eliminated the political.  According to his\ninterpretation, the angels ascending are the philosophers, who ascend\nthe ladder of wisdom toward metaphysics, the final subject of the\ncurriculum. Who then are the angels that descend?  They are not the\nprophets, descending with wisdom to rule the people, but separate\nintelligences, which descend to help the human intellect reach its\nfinal perfection: knowledge of and conjunction with God.\n\n2. Jeremiah 9:22\u201323\n\n\nThus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither\nlet the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in\nhis riches; But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he\nunderstandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise\nlovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in\nthese things I delight, saith the Lord.\n\n\nIn Guide 3:54, Maimonides presents a brief discussion of the\npurpose of human existence. Building upon Aristotelian treatments of\nthis problem, he presents four possible human ends: perfection in\nwealth, health, ethics, and intellect. He then introduces a biblical\ntext, Jeremiah 9:22\u201323, which he says presents the same ideas of the\nphilosophers, but with one important addition. Namely, like the\nphilosophers, Jeremiah also singles out four possible\nperfections\u2014\u201cmight,\u201d \u201criches,\u201d ethical\n\u201cwisdom,\u201d and \u201cunderstanding and\nknowledge\u201d\u2014but he adds something more as well:\n\u201cexercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the\nearth.\u201d Thus knowledge of God, Maimonides seems to suggest,\nshould lead to action; the contemplative should serve a practical\nend.\n\n\nIn the preface to the translation of Maimonides on Avot, as well as in\nthe commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon discusses these same verses\nfrom Jeremiah in detail, explains and criticizes Maimonides\u2019\ninterpretation of them, then presents his own novel\nexplication. According to Ibn Tibbon, the final human perfection is\nknowledge and understanding of God, without qualification. Thus the\nverse should be understood differently, with the final clause relating\nto God rather than man; man should understand and know God, full\nstop.\n\n\n3. Song of Songs 5:2\n\nI sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that\nknocketh.\n\n\nIn Guide 3:51, Maimonides cites Song of Songs 5:2 in the\ncourse of his discussion of the patriarchs and Moses. These figures,\nhe says, reached the highest level of human perfection, for they were\nin constant communion with God and also fully involved in the creation\nand governance of a religious community. They were like the\nprotagonist of Song of Songs, with heart awake even while asleep.\n\n\nWhat was Ibn Tibbon\u2019s understanding of the same subject? How did he\nbuild on and respond to Maimonides\u2019 use of the verse? As in the\nprevious two examples, Ibn Tibbon cites and discusses Guide\n3:51, but suggests a different approach. As he explains in the\ncommentary on Ecclesiastes, the patriarchs and Moses did achieve this\nstate of philosophy and politics, precisely as Maimonides had\ndescribed it; they were asleep (in the world of matter) with heart\nawake (toward the world of God). But in Ibn Tibbon\u2019s opinion, although\nthis state is worthy of praise, they could have reached a higher state\nstill: they could have been completely awake, engaged in a life of\npure contemplation, free from the hindrances of the physical and\npolitical world.\n\n\nIn all three of these examples, Ibn Tibbon emphasizes the\ncontemplative over the practical. He works with the same biblical\ntexts singled out by Maimonides, but arrives at a different\nphilosophical position. It is precisely this interesting\nphilosophical-exegetical give and take, the free discussion of ideas\nwithin a fixed biblical framework, that characterized the Maimonidean\ntradition of philosophy and exegesis, which was founded by Ibn Tibbon\nand continued by his descendents, disciples, and admirers.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"TraSamIbnTib\">Translations by Samuel Ibn Tibbon</a>", "<a name=\"WriSamIbnTib\">Writings by Samuel Ibn Tibbon</a>", "<a name=\"SecWor\">Secondary works</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"TraSamIbnTib\">Translations by Samuel Ibn Tibbon</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Sonne, Isaiah, \u201cMaimonides\u2019 Letter to Samuel b.
