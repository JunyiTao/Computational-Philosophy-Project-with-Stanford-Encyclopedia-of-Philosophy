    "main_text": "The Perspective-Based Conception\n3. The Perspective-Based Conception\n\nThe third way in which the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction\nhas historically been drawn is in terms of the perspectives from which\nthe reasons in question can be recognized as reasons. The basic idea\nis to specify a suitably objective perspective and hold that\nagent-neutral reasons can be appreciated as such from that perspective\nwhile agent-relative reasons cannot. Jonathan Dancy seems to read\nNagel in this way:\n\nNagel holds that there are three kinds of reason. The first are\nstubbornly subjective reasons, such as those which are in play when we\nare choosing from a menu in a restaurant\u2026But there are two\nclasses of objective reasons. The first are agent-relative\nreasons\u2026the second are agent-neutral reasons. Both are\nrecognizable at some distance from here, as we shave peculiarities\nfrom our perspective in the move towards objectivity. The\nagent-relative ones are less objective, of course, though they can be\nrecognized, and in some sense endorsed, from more objective points of\nview. However, what is recognized and endorsed is not the importance\nwhich the agent finds in (e.g.) his own life-time projects; this\nitself cannot be recognized from much further out. As we move away\nfrom the agent\u2019s own perspective, all that can be recognized is\nthat he finds importance in them, which is quite a different matter.\n(Dancy 1993: 146)\n\n\nThis reading of Nagel is to some extent invited by Nagel\u2019s use\nof the metaphor of a \u2018view from nowhere\u2019. Moreover, it is\ntrue that in The Possibility of Altruism Nagel does argue\nthat agent-relative reasons (which he then called\n\u2018subjective\u2019) cannot be recognized from a certain sort of\nimpersonal perspective. However, this was precisely supposed to be the\nconclusion of a substantive and highly controversial argument which\nNagel has since rejected (on the strength of an argument from Nicholas\nSturgeon; see Sturgeon 1974). If agent-relative reasons cannot be\nappreciated from a suitably objective perspective then Nagel quite\nclearly thinks that this will need to be established by argument. It\nis not part of his definition of agent-relativity; otherwise\nhe could have skipped most of the argument of The Possibility of\nAltruism as his main conclusion would have been established by\nlinguistic fiat. As we have seen, he instead defines agent-relativity\nin terms of the general form of the reason.\n\nStill, even if this is not what Nagel had in mind might this approach\nnot be philosophically useful and important? It would, after all, have\nthe virtue of being a distinction which is available to\nparticularists. For the idea of more and less objective perspectives\nis not obviously incompatible with even very radical forms of\nparticularism. Nor does it seem to exclude a variety of ontological\nviews about reasons as the reason-statement-based version of the\ndistinction did.\n On an interesting novel version of the perspective-based approach\ndefended by L\u00f6schke, it can enable us to understand\nagent-relative reasons as valid even if all value is agent-neutral.\nThis is because the perspective of the agent on the relevant\nagent-neutral value matters to their reasons in a way that makes the\nreason count as indexed to that agent in an important sense\n(L\u00f6schke 2020). The core idea is that the strength of a reason\ncan be relative to an agent in virtue of that agent\u2019s\nperspective, even if its status as a reason (with whatever strength it\nmay have) is not. L\u00f6schke calls his approach the \u201cnormative\nforce interpretation,\u201d it is relatively clear that it is a\nversion of the perspective-based approach in my sense.  L\u00f6schke\nputs his view in terms of the agent\u2019s perspective here, for\nexample: \u201cNFI is in line with the idea that agent-relative\nreasons stem from the first-person perspective of agents and that\nmoral theory must make room for the importance of what an agent\nconsiders to be important and valuable in life\u201d (L\u00f6schke\n2021: 369).\n\nHowever useful the distinction is, though, it is not\none which is well-suited to doing the work traditionally associated\nwith the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction. For a start, a\nplausible litmus test for any proposed version of the distinction is\nthat it uncontroversially classifies egoistic reasons as\nagent-relative and utilitarian reasons (to maximize happiness,\nsimpliciter) as agent-neutral. These are perhaps the most commonly\ncited paradigms of each sort of reason, after all. Also, the\ndistinction is often thought to capture in a more abstract sense what\nHenry Sidgwick was discussing when he spoke of a \u2018dualism of\npractical reason\u2019 between reasons of self-interest and reasons\nof general benevolence (see Sidgwick 1907).\n\nThe crucial point is that it is far from obvious that the\nperspective-based distinction satisfies this litmus test.\nNagel\u2019s attempt to prove that agent-relative reasons in his\nsense (including egoistic reasons) cannot be appreciated from a\nsuitably objective perspective is widely regarded as a failure, as are\nmany other attempts to refute egoism (and agent-relativism more\ngenerally) by showing it is incompatible with some suitable objective\nperspective. So perhaps egoistic reasons can, after all, be\nappreciated even from an ideally objective perspective on any of a\nwide range of conceptions of objectivity. Perhaps not, though; perhaps\nsome clever argument will still show that agent-relativity is\nincompatible with some important and independent notion of\nobjectivity. In any event, this remains at best a very controversial\nhunch rather than something which has been uncontroversially\ndemonstrated. This alone should give us great pause about adopting the\nperspective-based approach to the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction. Egoistic reasons are paradigmatic agent-relative reasons,\nand it should be trivial that they come out as such rather than a\nmatter of great controversy. Moreover, the same point applies not only\nto egoistic reasons but to all of the typically invoked paradigms of\nagent-relativity. Reasons arising out of special relations to\none\u2019s nearest and dearest are also paradigmatically\nagent-relative, but it is also far from clear that they will come out\nas such on the perspective-based approach. So even if we keep a single\nconception of objectivity as fixed there will be great controversy\nover whether seemingly paradigmatic instances of agent-relativity\nreally are such. This is unfortunate. The agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction should be one which is useful for framing these\ndebates at the outset (for more on this, see Dreier 1993) and not one\nwhich we can deploy with confidence only after the debates have been\nsettled. However, there will also be great controversy over just what\nthe right conception of objectivity is as well as controversy over the\nimplications of any given conception thereof. This threatens to mire\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in such controversy from\nthe outset as to make it virtually useless. Much better instead to\ndefine agent-relativity and agent-neutrality in terms of the logical\nform of the principle corresponding to the reason and then let it be a\nmatter of substantive debate whether agent-relative reasons so\nunderstood can be appreciated from various objective perspectives.\n",
