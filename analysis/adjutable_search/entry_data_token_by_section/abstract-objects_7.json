    "main_text": "What is an Abstract Object? || The Way of Conflation\n3.2 The Way of Conflation\n\nAccording to the way of conflation, the abstract/concrete\ndistinction is to be identified with one or another metaphysical\ndistinction already familiar under another name: as it might be, the\ndistinction between sets and individuals, or the distinction between\nuniversals and particulars. There is no doubt that some authors have\nused the terms in this way. (Thus Quine 1948 uses \u2018abstract\nentity\u2019 and \u2018universal\u2019 interchangeably.) This sort\nof conflation is however rare in recent philosophy.\n",
