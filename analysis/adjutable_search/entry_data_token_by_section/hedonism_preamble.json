    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe word \u2018hedonism\u2019 comes from the ancient Greek for\n\u2018pleasure\u2019. Psychological or motivational hedonism claims\nthat only pleasure or pain motivates us. Ethical or evaluative hedonism\nclaims that only pleasure has worth or value and only pain or\ndispleasure has disvalue or the opposite of worth. Jeremy Bentham\nasserted both psychological and ethical hedonism with the first two\nsentences of his book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals\nand Legislation: \u201cNature has placed mankind under the\ngovernance of two sovereign masters, pain, and\npleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to\ndo, as well as to determine what we shall do\u201d. Debate about\nhedonism was a feature too of many centuries before Bentham, and this\nhas also continued after him. Other key contributors to debate over\nhedonism include Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Aquinas, Butler, Hume,\nMill, Nietzsche, Brentano, Sidgwick, Moore, Ross, Broad, Ryle and\nChisholm.\n\n\nIn general, pleasure is understood broadly below, as including or as\nincluded in all pleasant feeling or experience: contentment, delight,\necstasy, elation, enjoyment, euphoria, exhilaration, exultation,\ngladness, gratification, gratitude, joy, liking, love, relief,\nsatisfaction, Schadenfreude, tranquility, and so on. Pain or displeasure\ntoo is understood broadly below, as including or as included in all\nunpleasant experience or feeling: ache, agitation, agony, angst,\nanguish, annoyance, anxiety, apprehensiveness, boredom, chagrin,\ndejection, depression, desolation, despair, desperation, despondency,\ndiscomfort, discombobulation, discontentment, disgruntlement, disgust,\ndislike, dismay, disorientation, dissatisfaction, distress, dread,\nenmity, ennui, fear, gloominess, grief, guilt, hatred, horror, hurting,\nirritation, loathing, melancholia, nausea, queasiness, remorse,\nresentment, sadness, shame, sorrow, suffering, sullenness, throb,\nterror, unease, vexation, and so on. \u2018Pain or displeasure\u2019\nis usually stated below just as \u2018pain\u2019 or just as\n\u2018displeasure\u2019. Further economy is sometimes secured by\nstating, just about pleasure or just about displeasure, points that do\nor might apply to both. Whether such pleasure-displeasure parallels\nactually hold is a significant further issue, touched upon only briefly\nin the present entry.\n\n\nWhat sort of entity is pleasure or pain? Candidates include: state,\nstate of affairs, thing, event and property. Second, is it a\nfirst-order entity or a higher-order entity? For example, is your pain\nyour toothache, its naggingness, or both? When you enjoy the cityscape\nbelow your viewpoint, is your pleasure your view, your enjoyment of it,\nthe pleasurableness of your enjoyment of it, or all three? And so on.\nThird, does pleasure essentially have a \u2018feel\u2019 or\nphenomenology, a \u2018something it is like\u2019 (Nagel 1974).\nFourth, does it essentially have directedness or\n\u2018aboutness\u2019 or intentionality? These issues about the\nnature of pleasure and displeasure are discussed below (see also the\nentry for\n pleasure)\n as they bear on the\nnature and merits of various forms of hedonism.\n",
