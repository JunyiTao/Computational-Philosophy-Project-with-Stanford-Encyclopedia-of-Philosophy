    "main_text": "The Fall\n6. Philosopher of the Present\n\nWell into the twenty-first century, the career of Camus\u2019s\nthought, like that of his onetime friend Jean-Paul Sartre, has been\nremarkable. Two generations after his death, his complex and profound\nphilosophical project, as discussed by Srigley, is very much with us\nbecause it seeks not only to critique modernity but reaches back to\nthe ancient world to lay the basis for alternative ways of thinking\nand living in the present. Thus, if in some respects he anticipated\nthe postmodernists, he retained a central metaphysical concern with\nsuch ideas as absurdity and revolt. Unlike postmodernism, Camus was,\nas Jeffrey C. Isaac says, a \u201cchastened humanist\u201d who\nremained deeply attached, as was Hannah Arendt, to \u201cthe language\nof right, freedom, and truth\u201d (Isaac 244).\n\nCamus\u2019s ideas and name have come up again and again during the\ntwenty-first century, not only among philosophers and literary\nscholars, among specialists in a wide variety of fields, in the press\nand among political writers, and in conversations among the general\npublic who read his books or have heard about his ideas. First, his\nexploration of living in a Godless universe has led to his name being\nmentioned often in discussions about religious nonbelief (Aronson\n2011). Yet unlike the \u201cnew atheists\u201d the great nonbeliever\nCamus was never assured enough to declare that God does not exist and\nwas not militantly opposed to religious belief and practice (Carlson\n2014). Even as Camus presents in The Plague a profoundly\ncritical picture of Father Paneloux\u2019s sermons describing the\nplague first as a punishment for human sin and then as a call to\nembrace the divine mystery, for a time the priest nevertheless humbly\njoins the collective project of the \u201csanitary squads.\u201d\n\nSecond, after the 9/11 attack and during the \u201cwar on\nterror,\u201d Camus\u2019s writings on violence became much\ndiscussed. For example The Rebel was explored anew for hints\nabout the motivations behind twenty-first century terrorism. Paul\nBerman deployed Camus in his justification for the \u201cwar on\nterror\u201d against Islamic \u201cpathological mass\nmovements\u201d (Berman 2003, 27\u201333). Foley, on the other hand,\ndevoted attention to the actual relevance of Camus\u2019s attempts to\nthink through the question of political violence on a small-group and\nindividual level. He shows how, both in The Rebel and in his\nplays Caligula and The Just Assassins, Camus brings\nhis philosophy to bear directly on the question of the exceptional\nconditions under which an act of political murder can considered\nlegitimate: (1) The target must be a tyrant; (2) the killing must not\ninvolve innocent civilians; (3) the killer must be in direct physical\nproximity to the victim; and (4) there must be no alternative to\nkilling (Foley 2008, 93). Furthermore, because the killer has violated\nthe moral order on which human society is based, Camus makes the\ndemand that he or she must be prepared to sacrifice his or her own\nlife in return. But if he accepts killing in certain circumstances,\nFoley stresses that Camus rules out mass killing, indirect murder,\nkilling civilians, and killing without an urgent need to remove\nmurderous and tyrannical individuals. These demands rest on the core\nidea of The Rebel, that to rebel is to assert and respect a\nmoral order, and this must be sustained both by clear limits and by\nthe murderer\u2019s willingness to\n die.[4]\n\nDuring the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, sales of\nThe Plague exploded and interest was so great that the\nNew York Times republished its original 1948 review by\nStephen Spender. Hundreds of articles were written about it in all\nlanguages \u2013 by bloggers, artists, cartoonists, journalists,\nCamus specialists, medical practitioners, scholars from every\nconceivable discipline \u2013 and philosophers. Camus\u2019s work\nwas being mined for what it had to teach about living in and coping\nwith the pandemic, including such topics as: functioning amidst the\nabsurdity of a disease that appeared for seemingly no reason at all\n(de Botton 2021); the similarities and differences between his plague\nand ours (Aronson, 2020); living and working within the paralyzing\nexistential fear imposed by the pandemic (Farr 2021); retaining hope\namidst catastrophe (Kabel & Phillipson 2020); and the solidarity\namong members of the \u201csanitary squads\u201d doing so (Illing\n2020). In the face of absurdity and mass death many writers extolled\nthe modest and self-limiting philosophy behind The Plague,\nrooted in The Myth of Sisyphus and further developed in\nThe Rebel: one must act, with others, wherever one happens to\nbe, by simply doing one\u2019s job. As Rieux says:\n\u201cthere\u2019s no question of heroism in all this. It\u2019s a\nmatter of common decency. That\u2019s an idea which may make some\npeople smile, but the only means of fighting a plague is \u2013\ncommon decency\u201d (P,\n 150).[5]\n",
