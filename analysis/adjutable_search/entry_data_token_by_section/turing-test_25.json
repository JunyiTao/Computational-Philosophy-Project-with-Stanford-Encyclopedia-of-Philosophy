    "main_text": "Alternative Tests || Should the Turing Test be Considered Harmful?\n5.4 Should the Turing Test be Considered Harmful?\n\nPerhaps the best known attack on the suggestion that The Turing Test\nprovides an appropriate research goal for AI is due to Hayes and Ford\n(1995). Among the controversial claims that Hayes and Ford make, there\nare at least the following:\n\nTuring suggested the imitation game as a definite goal for program\nof research.\nTuring intended The Turing Test to be a gender test rather than a\nspecies test.\nThe task of trying to make a machine that is successful in The\nTuring Test is so extremely difficult that no one could seriously\nadopt the creation of such a machine as a research goal.\nThe Turing Test suffers from the basic design flaw that it sets\nout to confirm a \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d, viz. that there is no\ndifference in behavior between certain machines and humans.\nNo null effect experiment can provide an adequate criterion for\nintelligence, since the question can always arise that the judges did\nnot look hard enough (and did not raise the right kinds of questions).\nBut, if this question is left open, then there is no stable endpoint\nof enquiry.\nNull effect experiments cannot measure anything: The Turing Test\ncan only test for complete success. (\u201cA man who failed to seem\nfeminine in 10% of what he said would almost always fail the Imitation\ngame.\u201d)\nThe Turing Test is really a test of the ability of the human\nspecies to discriminate its members from human imposters. (\u201cThe\ngender test \u2026 is a test of making a mechanical\ntransvestite.\u201d)\nThe Turing Test is circular: what it fails to detect cannot be\n\u201cintelligence\u201d or\u201chumanity\u201d, since many humans\nwould fail The Turing Test. Indeed, \u201csince one of the players\nmust be judged to be a machine, half the human population would fail\nthe species test\u201d.\nThe perspective of The Turing Test is arrogant and parochial: it\nmistakenly assumes that we can understand human cognition without\nfirst obtaining a firm grasp of the basic principles of\ncognition.\nThe Turing Test does not admit of weaker, different, or even\nstronger forms of intelligence than those deemed human.\n\n\nSome of these claims seem straightforwardly incorrect. Consider (h),\nfor example. In what sense can it be claimed that 50% of the human\npopulation would fail \u201cthe species test\u201d? If \u201cthe\nspecies test\u201d requires the interrogator to decide which of two\npeople is a machine, why should it be thought that the verdict of the\ninterrogator has any consequences for the assessment of the\nintelligence of the person who is judged to be a machine? (Remember,\ntoo, that one of the conditions for \u201cthe species\ntest\u201d\u2014as it is originally described by Hayes and\nFord\u2014is that one of the contestants is a machine. While\nthe machine can \u201cdemonstrate\u201d its intelligence by winning\nthe imitation game, a person cannot \u201cdemonstrate\u201d their\nlack of intelligence by failing to win.)\n\nIt seems wrong to say that The Turing Test is defective because it is\na \u201cnull effect experiment\u201d. True enough, there is a sense\nin which The Turing Test does look for a \u201cnull result\u201d: if\nordinary judges in the specified circumstances fail to identify the\nmachine (at a given level of success), then there is a given\nlikelihood that the machine is intelligent. But the point of insisting\non \u201cordinary judges\u201d in the specified circumstances is\nprecisely to rule out irrelevant ways of identifying the machine (i.e.\nways of identifying the machine that are not relevant to the question\nwhether it is intelligent). There might be all kinds of irrelevant\ndifferences between a given kind of machine and a human\nbeing\u2014not all of them rendered undetectable by the experimental\nset-up that Turing describes\u2014but The Turing Test will remain a\ngood test provided that it is able to ignore these irrelevant\ndifferences.\n\nIt also seems doubtful that it is a serious failing of The Turing Test\nthat it can only test for \u201ccomplete success\u201d. On the one\nhand, if a man has a one in ten chance of producing a claim that is\nplainly not feminine, then we can compute the chance that he will be\ndiscovered in a game in which he answers N\nquestions\u2014and, if N is sufficiently small, then it\nwon\u2019t turn out that \u201che would almost always fail to\nwin\u201d. On the other hand, as we noted at the end of Section 4.4\nabove, if one were worried about the \u201cYES/NO\u201d nature of\n\u201cThe Turing Test\u201d, then one could always get the judges to\nproduce probabilistic verdicts instead. This change preserves the\ncharacter of The Turing Test, but gives it scope for greater\nstatistical sophistication.\n\nWhile there are (many) other criticisms that can be made of the claims\ndefended by Hayes and Ford (1995), it should be acknowledged that they\nare right to worry about the suggestion that The Turing Test provides\nthe defining goal for research in AI. There are various reasons why\none should be loathe to accept the proposition that the one central\nambition of AI research is to produce artificial people. However it is\nworth pointing out that there is no reason to think that Turing\nsupposed that The Turing Test defined the field of AI research (and\nthere is not much evidence that any other serious thinkers have\nthought so either). Turing himself was well aware that there might be\nnon-human forms of intelligence\u2014cf. (j) above. However, all of\nthis remains consistent with the suggestion that it is quite\nappropriate to suppose that The Turing Test sets one long\nterm goal for AI research: one thing that we might well aim to do\neventually is to produce artificial people. If\u2014as Hayes\nand Ford claim\u2014that task is almost impossibly difficult, then\nthere is no harm in supposing that the goal is merely an\nambit goal to which few resources should be committed; but we\nmight still have good reason to allow that it is a goal.\n\nOthers who have argued that we need to \u201cmove beyond\u201d The\nTuring Test include Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo (2000) (2020) and\nMarcus (2020).\n",
