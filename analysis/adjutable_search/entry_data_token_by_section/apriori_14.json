Even if intuitions can justify, can they yield knowledge of the external world?\n\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, we grant that intuitions\nproperly understood and had under ideal conditions by people with\na deep understanding of the relevant concepts can justify certain\npropositions. But can they yield knowledge about the external\nworld? Carrie Jenkins has argued that they can insofar as the\nconcepts that play a role in a priori justification have been\nshaped by experience. She thinks that for knowledge (not\njustification) our concepts must be grounded. By this she\nmeans that they must accurately and non-accidentally represent the\nworld. So the concept table can be grounded for a person in a\nworld where there are tables but not for a brain-in-a-vat (BIV)\n(Jenkins 2008a: 128\u201329). For a concept to be\njustified for Jenkins is for it to be\n\u201crespectable\u201d for us to rely on it (by which, I believe,\nshe means that we would be epistemically blameless in relying on it)\nas \u201ca relevantly accurate guide to the world\u201d (Jenkins\n2008a: 129). So a BIV can have a justified, though not a grounded\nconcept, about things existing in the external world.\n\nJenkins thinks that our concepts are grounded. Her argument for\nthinking this is that our basic concepts are useful, and in that\nrespect they are sort of like maps. If they did not fit the world\n(weren\u2019t grounded) even though they are founded on sensory\ninput, their usefulness would be a miracle. They would be like a map\nthat fits the world that was based on a dream. Since we should not\nbelieve in miracles, those concepts must fit the world. The best\nexplanation of the usefulness of our concepts is that they accurately\nrepresent features of the world that produce our sensory inputs that\nallow us to navigate successfully in the world. She thinks that this\nNo-Miracles Argument shows that it is reasonable to think that our\nconcepts (or groups of concepts) mirror the world\u2019s structure\n(Jenkins 2008a: 139). If we have justified concepts, ones we\nhave reason to think fit the world, we can examine them to see what\nthey involve and then have a priori justification for\nbelieving that certain propositions that involve them are true of\nthe world. So, on her view, we (but not BIVs) could know a\npriori, merely on the basis of examining our concepts,\nthat all vixens are female and that there are (or at least\nwere) vixens, and that all bachelors are unmarried and that\nthere are (or at least were) bachelors. If we have grounded\nconcepts, we (but not BIVs) can have a priori knowledge that\nall of these propositions are true. Yet gaining this sort of knowledge\nabout our external environment a priori seems impossible.\n\nFurther, it is not obvious that all a priori knowledge rests\non grounded concepts. Normative or mathematical concepts might map the\nnormative and mathematical domains but not the external world. We can\nknow a priori that it is wrong to torture children just for\nthe fun of it and that two is the only even prime regardless of what\nthe external world is like. Perhaps we can also know a priori\nthat some general normative principles are true, such as the principle\nof inference to the best explanation (IBE). Roughly, this principle\nsays that we are justified in believing some hypothesis if it is the\nbest explanation of what we observe. For instance, it says that we are\njustified in believing that someone recently walked along the beach\nbecause that best explains our observation of footprints in the sand.\nBut we could not be justified in accepting IBE because it is useful\nand the best explanation of its usefulness is that it fits the way the\nworld is. That would be a circular argument for accepting IBE. Lastly,\nit seems possible for even a BIV to know certain conditional\npropositions, for instance, to know that that IF something is a vixen,\nit is a female fox and IF someone is bachelor, he is an unmarried\nmale.\n\nJenkins allows that some concepts can be grounded, even if they are\nnot directly grounded, provided they are constituted by grounded\nconcepts, but it is hard to see how the concepts spiritual\nand immaterial could be so constituted. Still, it seems that\nwe can know a priori that if there are angels, there are\nspiritual beings and if there are immaterial beings, they do\nnot occupy space.\n\nIt is one thing to hold that a priori knowledge requires\nenabling empirical experience to acquire the concepts that are the\nbasis of that sort of knowledge, and quite another thing to hold that\nthose concepts must be grounded in such experience. The latter rules\nout some seemingly obvious kinds of a priori knowledge (viz.,\nsome mathematical and normative knowledge, and knowledge of certain\nconditional propositions which seem merely to be about the\nrelationship of concepts), and so seems too strong. It also seems to\nallow in a priori knowledge of the existence of, say, foxes\nand bachelors, and so seems too weak.\n",
