    "main_text": "Recent Theories || Participation Theories\n5.4 Participation Theories\n\nParticipation theories take as their starting point various statements\nof the apostle Paul:\n\n\u201cI have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but\nChrist lives in me\u201d (Galatians 2:19\u201320),\n\u201cwe were therefore buried with him through baptism into\ndeath in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through\nthe glory of the Father, we too may live a new life\u201d (Romans\n6:4),\n\u201cwe were baptized by one Spirit into one body\u201d (1Cor.\n12:13) and\nChrist is the head of the body (Colossians 1:18).\n\n\nParticipation theories take these statements to indicate that\natonement works by humans being in some way united with Christ, so\nthat what he does is done also for them, which also effects healing in\nhuman hearts and minds. These theories thus emphasize the\n divinization/healing motif,\n where this healing is brought about through participation in a union\nwith Christ.\n\nBayne and Restall (2009) argue that participation theories do a better\njob than other theories of explaining why the incarnation is important\nfor atonement, and that they rightly view sin as a pollution that\nproduces a relational problem (rather than as a deontic matter of\nfailing in a duty). Crisp (2016; 2020a) advocates for a theory that\nemploys a robust notion of union. All fallen humans are part of a\nfour-dimensional entity, fallen humanity. Christ becomes human and\ncreates a new four-dimensional entity, redeemed humanity, of those who\njoin themselves to him in faith and love. The Holy Spirit brings about\ntransformation in the merely human members of redeemed\nhumanity\u2014using Christ\u2019s atoning work to bring about\ntransformation. Gorman\u2019s (2014) new-covenant model understands\nunion to result from a covenant, and what Christ\u2019s atonement\ndoes is form a new covenant through which various benefits flow to its\nmembers.\n",
