    "main_text": "Knowledge and Belief || Against Relativism and Scepticism\n4.2 Against Relativism and Scepticism\n\nAlthough it is not simply an epistemological notion, the way Davidson\npresents the idea of triangulation tends to be such as to bring its\nepistemological implications to the fore. This is especially true of\nthe way Davidson develops the idea in \u2018Three Varieties of\nKnowledge\u2019. Since our knowledge of our own minds is not\nindependent of our knowledge of the world nor of our knowledge of\nothers, so we cannot treat self-knowledge as a matter of our having\naccess to some set of private \u2018mental\u2019 objects. Our\nknowledge of ourselves arises only in relation to our involvement with\nothers and with respect to a publicly accessible world \u2013 as well\nas a history of such involvement (this is indeed part of the point of\nthe Swampman example). Even so, we retain a certain authority over our\nown attitudes and utterances simply in virtue of the fact that those\nattitudes and utterances are indeed our own (see \u2018First-Person\nAuthority\u2019, [1984]). Moreover, because our knowledge of the\nworld is inseparable from other forms of knowledge, global\nepistemological scepticism (the view that all or most of our beliefs\nabout the world could be false) turns out to be committed to much more\nthan is usually supposed. Should it indeed turn out that our beliefs\nabout the world were all, or for the most part, false, then this would\nnot only imply the falsity of most of our beliefs about others, but it\nwould also have the peculiar consequence of making false most of our\nbeliefs about ourselves \u2013 including the supposition that we do\nindeed hold those particular false beliefs. Although this may fall\nshort of demonstrating the falsity of such scepticism, it surely\ndemonstrates it to be deeply problematic.\n\nThe way in which the Davidsonian rejection of scepticism does indeed\nderive quite directly from Davidson\u2019s adoption of a holistic,\nexternalist approach to knowledge, and to attitudinal content in\ngeneral, has sometimes been obscured by Davidson\u2019s presentation\nof his argument against scepticism through the employment (for the\nfirst time in \u2018Thought and Talk\u2019[1975]) of the rather\nproblematic notion of an \u2018omniscient interpreter\u2019 (the\nidea echoes one deployed by Wilfrid Sellars in an essay with which\nDavidson was certainly familiar [Sellars, 1948]). Such an interpreter\nwould attribute beliefs to others and assign meanings to their\nutterances but would nevertheless do so on the basis of her own (true)\nbeliefs. The omniscient interpreter would therefore have to find a\nlarge amount of agreement between her own beliefs and the beliefs of\nthose she interprets, and what was agreed would also, by hypothesis,\nbe true. Like the Swampman example, however, the omniscient\ninterpreter example has given rise to a number of complications and\nmisunderstandings (so much so that Davidson has expressed regret at\never having deployed those examples in the first place), and although\nthe omniscient interpreter appears at several places in\nDavidson\u2019s writings, the idea disappears from his later\ndiscussions, and does not play a crucial role in his thinking.\n\nA feature of both the triangulation argument, and the Davidsonian\naccount of radical interpretation, is that the attribution of\nattitudes must always proceed in tandem with the interpretation of\nutterances \u2013 identifying content, whether of utterances or of\nattitudes, is indeed a single project. An inability to interpret\nutterances (that is, an inability to assign meanings to instances of\nputative linguistic behaviour) will thereby imply an inability to\nattribute attitudes (and vice versa). A creature that we cannot\ninterpret as capable of meaningful speech will thus also be a creature\nthat we cannot interpret as capable of possessing contentful\nattitudes. Such considerations lead Davidson to deny that\nnon-linguistic animals are capable of thought \u2013 where thought\ninvolves the possession of propositional attitudes such as beliefs or\ndesires (see especially \u2018Thought and Talk\u2019). This does not\nmean that such animals have no mental life at all, nor does it mean\nthat we cannot usefully use mental concepts in explaining and\npredicting the behaviour of such creatures. What it does mean,\nhowever, is that the extent to which we can think of such creatures as\nhaving attitudes and a mental life like our own is measured by the\nextent to which we can assign determinate propositional content to the\nattitudes we would ascribe to those creatures. A further consequence\nof this view is that the idea of an untranslatable language \u2013 an\nnotion often found in association with the thesis of conceptual\nrelativism \u2013 cannot be given any coherent formulation\n(Davidson\u2019s argument here is suggestive, as Davidson notes, of a\nform of transcendental argumentation; see Davidson, 2001b: 72; but\nalso Davidson, in Hahn, 1999: 342\u20134). Inability to translate\ncounts as evidence, not of the existence of an untranslatable\nlanguage, but of the absence of a language of any sort (see \u2018On\nthe Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme\u2019 [1974])\n",
