    "main_text": "Fundamentals || Backward induction\n4.2 Backward induction\nThe second fundamental result analyzes the consequences of\nrationality and common belief/knowledge of rationality\nin extensive games (i.e., trees instead of matrices). Here,\nthe most well-known solution concept is the so-called subgame\nperfect equilibrium, also known as backward induction in\ngames of perfect information. The epistemic characterization of this\nsolution concept is in terms of \u201csubstantive rationality\u201d\nand common belief that all players are substantively rational\n(cf. also Vanderschraaf & Sillari 2009: sec. 2.8). The main point\nthat we highlight in this section, which is by now widely acknowledged\nin the literature, is:\n Belief revision policies play a key role\nin the epistemic analysis of extensive games\n\nThe most well-known illustration of this is through the comparison\nof two apparently contradictory results regarding the consequences of\nassuming rationality and common knowledge of rationality in extensive\ngames. Aumann (1995) showed that this epistemic condition implies that\nthe players will play according to the backward induction solution\nwhile Stalnaker (1998) argued that this is not necessarily true. The\ncrucial difference between these two results is the way in which they\nmodel the players\u2019 belief change upon (hypothetically) learning\nthat an opponent has deviated from the backward induction path.\n4.2.1 Extensive games: basic definitions\nExtensive games make explicit the sequential structure of choices\nin a game situation. In this section, we focus on games of perfect\ninformation in which there is no uncertainty about earlier\nchoices in the game. These games are represented by tree-like\nstructures:\n\n\nDefinition 4.3 (Perfect Information Extensive Game)\nAn extensive game is a tuple \\(\\langle N, T, Act, \\tau, \\{ u_i \\}_{i\\in N}\\rangle\\), where\n\n\n\\(N\\) is a finite set of players;\n\\(T\\) is a tree describing the temporal structure of the game\nsituation: Formally, \\(T\\) consists of a set of nodes and an immediate\nsuccessor relation \\(\\rightarrowtail\\). Let \\(Z\\) denote the set of\nterminal nodes (i.e., nodes without any successors) and \\(V\\) the\nremaining nodes (called decision nodes). Let \\(v_0\\) denote the initial\nnode (i.e., the root of the tree). The edges at a\ndecision node \\(v\\in V\\) are each labeled with actions\nfrom a set \\(Act\\). Let \\(Act(v)\\) denote the set of actions available at\n\\(v\\). Let \\(\\rightsquigarrow\\) be the transitive closure of\n\\(\\rightarrowtail\\).\n\\(\\tau\\) is a turn function assigning a player to each node \\(v\\in V\\)\n(for a player \\(i\\in N\\), let \\(V_i=\\{v\\in V \\mid \\tau(v)=i\\}\\)).\n\\(u_i: Z\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is the utility function for player\n\\(i\\) assigning real numbers to outcome nodes.\n\n\nA strategy is a term of art in extensive games. It\ndenotes a plan for every eventuality, which tells an agent what to do\nat all histories she is to play, even those which are excluded by the\nstrategy itself.\n\nDefinition 4.4 (Strategies)\nA strategy for player \\(i\\) is a function \\(s_i:V_i\n\\rightarrow Act\\) where for all \\(v\\in V_i\\), \\(s_i(v)\\in Act(v)\\). A\nstrategy profile, denoted \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\), is an element of \\(\\Pi_{i\\in\nN} S_i\\). Given a strategy profile \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\), let \\({\\mathbf{s}}_i\\)\nbe player \\(i\\)\u2019s component of \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\) and\n\\({\\mathbf{s}}_{-i}\\) the sequence of strategies form \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\) for\nall players except \\(i\\).\n\nEach strategy profile \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\) generates a path through an\nextensive game, where a path is a maximal sequence of nodes from the\nextensive game ordered by the immediate successor relations\n\\(\\rightarrowtail\\). We say that \\(v\\) is reached by a\nstrategy profile \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\) is \\(v\\) is on the path generated by\n\\({\\mathbf{s}}\\). Suppose that \\(v\\) is any node in an extensive game. Let\n\\(out(v,{\\mathbf{s}})\\) be the terminal node that is reached if,\nstarting at node \\(v\\), all the players move according to their\nrespective strategies in the profile \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\). Given a decision\nnode \\(v\\in V_i\\) for player \\(i\\), a strategy \\(s_i\\) for player \\(i\\), and a\nset \\(X\\subseteq S_{-i}\\) of strategy profiles of the opponents of \\(i\\),\nlet \\(Out_i(v,s_i, X)=\\{out(v, (s_i, s_{-i})) \\mid s_{-i}\\in X\\}\\). That\nis, \\(Out_i(v, s_i, X)\\) is the set of terminal nodes that may be\nreached if, starting at node \\(v\\), player \\(i\\) uses strategy \\(s_i\\) and\n\\(i\\)\u2019s opponents use strategy profiles from \\(X\\).\nThe following example of a perfect information extensive game will\nbe used to illustrate these concepts. The game is an instance of the\nwell-known centipede game, which has played an important role\nin the epistemic game theory literature on extensive games.\n\n\nFigure 17: An extensive game\n\nThe decision nodes for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) respectively are \\(V_A=\\{v_1,\nv_3\\}\\) and \\(V_B=\\{v_2\\}\\); and the outcome nodes are \\(O=\\{o_1, o_2,\no_3, o_4\\}\\). The labels of the edges in the above tree are the actions\navailable to each player. For instance, \\(Act(v_1)=\\{O_1, I_1\\}\\). There\nare four strategies for \\(A\\) and two strategies for \\(B\\). To simplify\nnotation, we denote the players\u2019 strategies by the sequence of\nchoices at each of their decision nodes. For example, \\(A\\)\u2019s\nstrategy \\(s_A^1\\) defined as \\(s_A^1(v_1)=O_1\\) and \\(s_A^1(v_3)=O_3\\) is\ndenoted by the sequence \\(O_1O_3\\). Thus, \\(A\\)\u2019s strategies are:\n\\(s_A^1=O_1O_3\\), \\(s_A^2=O_1I_3\\), \\(s_A^3=I_1O_3\\) and\n\\(s_A^4=I_1I_3\\). Note that \\(A\\)\u2019s strategy \\(s_A^2\\) specifies a\nmove at \\(v_3\\), even though the earlier move at \\(v_1\\), \\(O_1\\), means\nthat \\(A\\) will not be given a chance to move at \\(v_3\\). Similarly,\nBob\u2019s strategies will be denoted by \\(s_B^1=O_2\\) and \\(s_B^2=I_2\\),\ngiving the actions chosen by \\(B\\) at his decision node. Then, for\nexample, \\(out(v_2,(s_A^2, s_B^2))=o_4\\). Finally, if \\(X=\\{s_A^1,\ns_A^4\\}\\), then \\(Out_B(v_2,s_B^2, X)=\\{o_3, o_4\\}\\).\n4.2.2 Epistemic Characterization of Backward Induction\nThere are a variety of ways to describe the players\u2019\nknowledge and beliefs in an extensive game. The game models vary\naccording to which epistemic attitudes are represented (e.g.,\nknowledge and/or various notions of beliefs) and precisely how the\nplayers\u2019 disposition to revise their beliefs during a play of\nthe game is represented. Consult Battigalli, Di Tillio, & Samet\n(2013); Baltag, Smets, & Zvesper (2009); and Battigalli &\nSiniscalchi (2002) for a sampling of the different types of models\nfound in the literature.\nOne of the simplest approaches is to use the epistemic models\nintroduced in Section 2.2 (cf.  Aumann 1995;\nHalpern 2001b). An epistemic model of an extensive game \\(G=\\langle N,\nT, Act, \\tau, \\{ u_i \\}_{i \\in N}\\rangle\\) is a tuple \\(\\langle W,\n\\{\\Pi_i\\}_{i\\in N}, \\sigma\\rangle \\) where \\(W\\) is a nonempty set of\nstates; for each \\(i\\in N\\), \\(\\Pi_i\\) is a partition on \\(W\\); and\n\\(\\sigma:W\\rightarrow \\Pi_{i\\in N} S_i\\) is a function assigning to each\nstate \\(w\\), a strategy profile from \\(G\\). If \\(\\sigma(w)={\\mathbf{s}}\\),\nthen we write \\(\\sigma_i(w)\\) for \\({\\mathbf{s}}_i\\) and \\(\\sigma_{-i}(w)\\)\nfor \\({\\mathbf{s}}_{-i}\\). As usual, we assume that players know their\nown strategies: for all \\(w\\in W\\), if \\(w'\\in \\Pi_i(w)\\), then\n\\(\\sigma_i(w)=\\sigma_i(w')\\).\nThe rationality of a strategy at a decision node depends both on\nwhat actions the strategy prescribes at all future decision\nnodes and what the players know about the strategies that\ntheir opponents are following. Let \\(S_{-i}(w)=\\{\\sigma_{-i}(w') \\mid\nw'\\in \\Pi_i(w)\\}\\) be the set of strategy profiles of player\n\\(i\\)\u2019s opponents that \\(i\\) thinks are possible at state \\(w\\). Then,\n\\(Out_i(v, s_i, S_{-i}(w))\\) is the set of outcomes that player \\(i\\)\nthinks are possible starting at node \\(v\\) if she follows strategy\n\\(s_i\\).\n\nDefinition 4.5 (Rationality at a decision node)\nPlayer \\(i\\) is rational at node \\(v\\in V_i\\) in state\n\\(w\\) provided, for all strategies \\(s_i\\) such that \\(s_i\\ne\n\\sigma_i(w)\\), there is an \\(o'\\in Out_i(v, s_i, S_{-i}(w))\\) and \\(o\\in\nOut_i(v, \\sigma_i(w), S_{-i}(w))\\) such that \\(u_i(o)\\ge\nu_i(o')\\).\n\nSo, a player \\(i\\) is rational at a decision node \\(v\\in V_i\\) in state\n\\(w\\) provided that \\(i\\) does not know that there is an alternative\nstrategy that would give her a higher payoff.\n\nDefinition 4.6 (Substantive rationality)\nPlayer \\(i\\) is substantively rational at state \\(w\\)\nprovided for all decision nodes \\(v\\in V_i\\), \\(i\\) is rational at \\(v\\) in\nstate \\(w\\).\n\nWe can define the event that player \\(i\\) is substantively rational\nis the standard way: \\(\\mathsf{Rat}_i=\\{w \\mid \\mbox{player } i\\) is\nsubstantively rational at state \\(w\\}\\); and so, the event that all\nplayers are substantively rational is \\(\\mathsf{Rat}=\\bigcap_{i\\in N}\n\\mathsf{Rat}_i\\).\nThis notion of rationality at a decision node \\(v\\) is\nforward-looking in the sense that it only takes account of the\npossibilities that can arise from that point on in the\ngame. It does not take account of the previous moves leading to\n\\(v\\)\u2014i.e., which choices have or could have lead to \\(v\\). We shall\nreturn to this in the discussion below.\nAn important consequence of this is that the rationality of choices\nat nodes that are only followed by terminal nodes are independent of\nthe relevant player\u2019s knowledge. Call a node\n\\(v\\) pre-terminal if all of \\(v\\)\u2019s immediate\nsuccessors are terminal nodes. At such nodes, it does not matter what\nstrategies the player thinks are possible: If \\(v\\) is a pre-terminal\nnode and player \\(i\\) is moving at \\(v\\), then for all states in \\(w\\) in an\nepistemic model of the game and for all strategies \\(s_i\\in S_i\\),\n\\(Out_i(v, s_i, S_{-i}(w))=\\{s_i(v)\\}\\). This means, for example, that\nfor any state \\(w\\) in an epistemic model for the extensive game\nin Figure 17, the only strategies that are\nrational at node \\(v_3\\) in \\(w\\) are those that prescribe that \\(A\\)\nchooses \\(O_3\\) at node \\(v_3\\). Therefore, if \\(w\\in \\mathsf{Rat}_A\\), then\n\\(\\sigma_A(w)(v_3)=O_3\\). Whatever \\(A\\) knows, or rather knew about what\n\\(B\\) would do, if the game reaches the node \\(v_3\\), then the only\nrational choice for \\(A\\) is \\(O_3\\).\nInformation about the rationality of players at pre-terminal nodes\nis very important for players choosing earlier in the game. Returning\nto the game in Figure 17, if \\(B\\) knows that \\(A\\)\nis substantively rational at a state \\(w\\) in an epistemic model of the\ngame, then \\(\\Pi_B(w)\\subseteq \\mathsf{Rat}_A\\). Given the above\nargument, this means that if \\(w'\\in \\Pi_B(w)\\), then\n\\(\\sigma_A(w')(v_3)=O_3\\). Thus, we have for any state \\(w\\) in an\nepistemic model of the game, \n\n\\[Out_B(v_2, I_2, S_{-i}(w))=\\{o_3\\};\\]\n\nand, of course, \n\n\\[Out_B(v_2, O_2, S_{-i}(w))=\\{o_2\\}.\\] \n\nBut then,\n\\((O_2)\\) is the only strategy that is rational for \\(B\\) at \\(v_2\\) in any\nstate \\(w\\) (this follows since \\(u_B(o_2)=2\\ge 1=u_B(o_3)\\)). This means\nthat if \\(w\\in \\mathsf{Rat}_B\\) and \\(\\Pi_B(w)\\subseteq \\mathsf{Rat}_A\\),\nthen \\(\\sigma_B(w)(v_2)=O_2\\). Finally, if \\(A\\) knows that \\(B\\) knows that\n\\(A\\) is substantively rational, then\n\n\\[\\Pi_A(w)\\subseteq K_B\\mathsf{Rat}_A=\\{w' \\mid \\Pi_B(w')\\subseteq \\mathsf{Rat}_A\\}.\\] \n\nA similar argument shows that if \\(w\\in \\mathsf{Rat}_A\\) and \\(w\\in\nK_A(K_B(\\mathsf{Rat}_A))\\), then \\(\\sigma_A(w)(v_1)=O_1\\).\nThe strategy profile \\((O_1O_3, O_2)\\) is the unique\npure-strategy sub-game perfect equilibrium (Selten 1975) of\nthe game in Figure 17. Furthermore, the\nreasoning that we went through in the previous paragraphs is very\nclose to backward induction algorithm. This algorithm can be\nused to calculate the sub-game perfect equilibrium in any perfect\ninformation game in which all players receive unique payoffs at each\noutcome.[13]\n The algorithm runs as follows:\n\nBI Algorithm\nAt terminal nodes, players already have the\nnodes marked with their utilities. At a non-terminal node \\(v\\), once\nall immediate successors are marked, the node is marked as follows:\nfind the immediate successor \\(d\\) that has the highest utility for\nplayer \\(\\tau(v)\\) (the players whose turn it is to move at \\(v\\)). Copy\nthe utilities from \\(d\\) onto \\(v\\).\n\nGiven a marked game tree, the unique path that leads from the root\n\\(v_0\\) of the game tree to the outcome with the utilities that match\nthe utilities assigned to \\(v_0\\) is called the backward\ninduction path. In fact, the markings on each and every node\n(even nodes not on the backward induction path) defines a unique path\nthrough the game tree. These paths can be used to define strategies\nfor each player: At each decision node \\(v\\), choose the action that is\nconsistent with the path from \\(v\\). Let \\(BI\\) denote the\nresulting backward induction profile (where each\nplayer is following the strategy given by the backward induction\nalgorithm).\nAumann (1995) showed that the above reasoning can be carried out\nfor any extensive game of perfect information.\n\nTheorem 4.7 (Aumann 1995)\nSuppose that \\(G\\) is an extensive game of perfect information and\n\\({\\mathbf{s}}\\) is a strategy profile for \\(G\\). The following are\nequivalent:\n\nThere is a state \\(w\\) in an epistemic model of \\(G\\) such that\n\\(\\sigma(w) = {\\mathbf{s}}\\) and \\(w \\in C_N(\\mathsf{Rat})\\) (there is\ncommon knowledge that all players are substantively\nrational).\n\\({\\mathbf{s}}\\) is a sub-game perfect equilibrium of \\(G\\).\n\n\nThis result has been extensively discussed. The standard ground of\ncontention is that common knowledge of rationality used in this\nargument seems self-defeating, at least intuitively. Recall\nthat we asked what would \\(B\\) do at node \\(v_2\\) under common knowledge\nof rationality, and we concluded that he would choose \\(O_2\\). But, if\nthe game ever reaches that state, then, by the theorem above, \\(B\\) has\nto conclude that either \\(A\\) is not rational, or that she does not know\nthat he is. Both violate common knowledge of rationality. Is there a\ncontradiction here? This entry will not survey the extensive\nliterature on this question. The reader can consult the references in\nBruin 2010. Our point here is rather that how one looks at this\npotential paradox hinges on the way the players will revise their\nbeliefs in \u201cfuture\u201d rationality in the light of observing\na move that would be \u201cirrational\u201d under common knowledge\nof rationality.\n4.2.3 Common Knowledge of Rationality without Backward Induction\nStalnaker (1996, 1998) offers a different perspective on backward\ninduction. The difference with Aumann\u2019s analysis is best\nillustrated with the following example:\n\n\nFigure 18: An extensive game\n\nIn the above game the backward induction profile is \\((I_1I_3, I_2)\\)\nleading to the outcome \\(o_4\\) with both players receiving a payoff of\n\\(3\\). Consider an epistemic model with a single state \\(w\\) where\n\\(\\sigma(w)=(O_1I_3,O_2)\\). This is not the backward induction profile,\nand so, by Aumann\u2019s Theorem (Theorem\n4.7) it cannot be common knowledge among \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at state\n\\(w\\) that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are substantively rational.\nRecall that a strategy for a player \\(i\\) specifies choices\nat all decision nodes for \\(i\\), even those nodes that are\nimpossible to reach given earlier moves prescribed by the\nstrategy. Thus, strategies include \u201ccounterfactual\u201d\ninformation about what players would do if they were given a chance to\nmove at each of their decision nodes. In the single state epistemic\nmodel, \\(B\\) knows that \\(A\\) is following the strategy \\(O_1I_3\\). This\nmeans that \\(B\\) knows two things about \\(A\\)\u2019s choice behavior in\nthe game. The first is that \\(A\\) is choosing \\(O_1\\) initially. The\nsecond is that if \\(A\\) where given the opportunity to choose at \\(v_3\\),\nthen she would choose \\(I_3\\). Now, given \\(B\\)\u2019s knowledge about\nwhat \\(A\\) is doing, there is a sense in which whatever \\(B\\) would\nchoose at \\(v_2\\), his choice is rational. This follows trivially\nsince \\(A\\)\u2019s initial choice prescribed by her strategy at \\(w\\)\nmakes it impossible for \\(B\\) to move. Say that a player \\(i\\)\nis materially rational at a state \\(w\\) in an epistemic\nmodel of a game if \\(i\\) is rational at all decision nodes \\(v\\in V_i\\) in\nstate \\(w\\) that are reachable according to the strategy profile\n\\(\\sigma(w)\\). We have seen that \\(B\\) is trivially materially\nrational. Furthermore, \\(A\\) is materially rational since she knows that\n\\(B\\) is choosing \\(O_2\\) (i.e., \\(S_{-A}(w)=\\{O_2\\}\\)). Thus, \\(Out_A(v_1,\nO_1, S_{-i}(w))=\\{o_1\\}\\) and \\(Out_A(v_1, O_I, S_{-i}(w))=\\{o_2\\}\\); and\nso, \\(A\\)\u2019s choice of \\(O_1\\) at \\(v_1\\) makes her materially rational\nat \\(w\\). The main point of contention between Aumann and Stalnaker\nboils down to whether the single state epistemic model includes enough\ninformation about what exactly \\(B\\) thinks about \\(A\\)\u2019s choice at\n\\(v_3\\) when assessing the rationality of\n\\(B\\)\u2019s hypothetical choice of \\(O_2\\) at \\(v_2\\).\nAccording to Aumann, \\(B\\) is not substantively rational: Since\n\\(S_{-B}(w)=\\{O_1I_3\\}\\), we have\n\n\\[Out_B(v_2, O_2, S_{-B}(w))=\\{o_2\\}\\]\n\nand \n\n\\[Out_B(v_2, I_2, S_{-B}(w))=\\{o_4\\};\\] \n\nand so, \\(B\\) is not\nrational at \\(v_2\\) in \\(w\\) (note that\n\\(u_B(o_4)=3>1=u_B(o_2)\\)). Stalnaker suggests that the players\nshould be endowed with a belief revision policy that\ndescribes which informational state they would revert to in case they\nwere to observe moves that are inconsistent with what they know about\ntheir opponents\u2019 strategies. If \\(B\\) does learn that he can in\nfact move, then he has learned something about \\(A\\)\u2019s\nstrategy. In particular, he now knows that she cannot be following any\nstrategy that prescribes that she chooses \\(O_1\\) at \\(v_1\\) (so, in\nparticular, she cannot be following the strategy \\(O_1I_3\\).) Suppose\nthat \\(B\\) is disposed to react to surprising information about\n\\(A\\)\u2019s choice of strategy as follows: Upon learning that \\(A\\) is\nnot following a strategy in which she chooses \\(O_1\\) at \\(v_1\\), he\nconcludes that she is following strategy \\(I_1O_3\\). That is,\n\\(B\\)\u2019s \u201cbelief revision policy\u201d can be summarized as\nfollows: If \\(A\\) makes one \u201cirrational move\u201d, then she will\nmake another one. Stalnaker explains the apparent tension between this\nbelief revision policy and his knowledge that if \\(A\\) where given the\nopportunity to choose at \\(v_3\\), then she would choose \\(I_3\\) as\nfollows:\n\nTo think there is something incoherent about this combination of\nbeliefs and belief revision policy is to confuse epistemic with causal\ncounterfactuals\u2014it would be like thinking that because I believe\nthat if Shakespeare hadn\u2019t written Hamlet, it would have never\nbeen written by anyone, I must therefore be disposed to conclude that\nHamlet was never written, were I to learn that Shakespeare was in fact\nnot its author. (Stalnaker 1996: 152)\n\nThen, with respect to \\(B\\)\u2019s appropriately updated knowledge\nabout \\(A\\)\u2019s choice at \\(v_3\\) (according to his specified belief\nrevision policy), his strategy \\(O_2\\) is in fact rational. According to\nStalnaker, the rationality of a choice at a node \\(v\\) should be\nevaluated in the (counterfactual) epistemic state the player would\nbe in if that node was reached. Assuming \\(A\\) knows that \\(B\\) is\nusing the belief revision policy described above, then \\(A\\) knows that\n\\(B\\) is substantively rational in Stalnaker\u2019s sense. If the model\nincludes explicit information about the players\u2019 belief revision\npolicy, then there can be common knowledge of substantive rationality\n(in Stalnaker\u2019s sense) yet the players\u2019 choices do not\nconform to the backward induction profile.\n4.3 Common strong belief and forward induction\nIn the previous section, we assumed that the players interpret an\nopponent\u2019s deviation from expected play in an extensive game\n(e.g., deviation from the backward induction path) as an indication\nthat that player will choose \u201cirrationally\u201d at future\ndecision nodes. However, this is just one example of a belief revision\npolicy. It is not suggested that this is the belief revision policy\nthat players should adopt. Stalnaker\u2019s central claim is\nthat models of extensive games should include a component that\ndescribes the players\u2019 disposition to change their beliefs\nduring a play of the game, which may vary from model to model or even\namong the players in a single model:\n\nFaced with surprising behavior in the course of a game, the players\nmust decide what then to believe. Their strategies will be based on\nhow their beliefs would be revised, which will in turn be based on\ntheir epistemic priorities\u2014whether an unexpected action should\nbe regarded as an isolated mistake that is thereby epistemically\nindependent of beliefs about subsequent actions, or whether it\nreveals, intentionally or inadvertently, something about the\nplayer\u2019s expectations, and so about the way she is likely to\nbehave in the future. The players must decide, but the theorists\nshould not\u2014at least they should not try to generalize about\nepistemic priorities that are meant to apply to any rational agent in\nall situations. (Stalnaker 1998: 54)\n\nOne belief revision policy that has been extensively discussed in\nthe epistemic game theory literature is the rationalizability\nprinciple. Battigalli (1997) describes this belief revision\npolicy as follows:\n\nRationalizability Principle\nA player should always try to interpret her information about the\nbehavior of her opponents assuming that they are not implementing\n\u2018irrational\u2019 strategies.\n\nThis belief revision policy is closely related to\nso-called forward induction reasoning. To illustrate,\nconsider the following imperfect information game:\n\n\nFigure 19\n\nIn the above game, \\(A\\) can either exit the game initially (by\nchoosing \\(e\\)) for a guaranteed payoff of \\(2\\) or decide to play a game\nof imperfect information with \\(B\\). Notice that \\(r_1\\) is strictly\ndominated by \\(e\\): No matter what \\(B\\) chooses at \\(v_3\\), \\(A\\) is better\noff choosing \\(e\\). This means that if \\(A\\) is following a rational\nstrategy, then she will not choose \\(r_1\\) at \\(v_1\\). According to the\nrationalizability principle, \\(B\\) is disposed to believe that \\(A\\) did\nnot choose \\(r_1\\) if he is given a chance to move. Thus, assuming that\n\\(B\\) knows the structure of the game and revises his beliefs according\nto the rationalizability principle, his only rational strategy is to\nchoose \\(l_2\\) at his informational cell (consisting of \\(\\{v_2,\nv_3\\})\\). If \\(A\\) can anticipate this reasoning, then her only rational\nstrategy is to choose \\(e\\) at \\(v_1\\). This is the forward induction\noutcome of the above game.\nBattigalli & Siniscalchi (2002) develop an epistemic analysis\nof forward induction reasoning in extensive games (cf. also, Stalnaker\n1998: sec. 6). They build on an idea of Stalnaker (1998, 1996) to\ncharacterize forward induction solution concepts in terms of\ncommon strong belief in rationality. We discussed the\ndefinition of \u201cstrong belief\u201d in Section\n2.4. The mathematical representation of beliefs in Battigalli\n& Siniscalchi (2002) is different, although the underlying idea is\nthe same. A player strongly believes an event \\(E\\) provided she\nbelieves \\(E\\) is true at the beginning of the game (in the sense that\nshe assigns probability 1 to \\(E\\)) and continues to believe \\(E\\) as long\nas it is not falsified by the evidence. The evidence\navailable to a player in an extensive game consists of the\nobservations of the previous moves that are consistent with the\nstructure of the game tree\u2014i.e., the paths through a game\ntree. A complete discussion of this approach is beyond the scope of\nthe entry. Consult Battigalli & Siniscalchi (2002); Baltag et\nal. (2009); Battigalli & Friedenberg (2012); Bonanno (2013); Perea\n(2012, 2014); and van Benthem & Gheerbrant (2010) for a discussion\nof this approach and alternative epistemic analyses of backward and\nforward induction.\n5. Developments\nIn this section, we present a number of results that build on the\nmethodology presented in the previous section. We discuss the\ncharacterization of the Nash equilibrium, incorporate considerations\nof weak dominance into the players\u2019 reasoning and allow the\nplayers to be unaware, as opposed to uncertain,\nabout some aspects of the game.\n5.1 Nash Equilibrium\n5.1.1 The Result\nIterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies is a very\nintuitive concept, but for many games it does not tell anything about\nwhat the players will or should choose. In coordination games\n(Figure 1 above) for instance, all\nprofiles, can be played under rationality and common belief of\nrationality.\nLooking again at Figure 1, one can\nask what would happen if Bob knew (that is had correct\nbeliefs about) Ann\u2019s strategy choice? Intuitively, it is quite\nclear that his rational choice is to coordinate with her. If\nhe knows that she plays \\(t\\), for instance, then playing \\(l\\)\nis clearly the only rational choice for him, and similarly, if he\nknows that she plays \\(b\\), then \\(r\\) is the only rational choice. The\nsituation is symmetric for Ann. For instance, if she knows that Bob\nplays \\(l\\), then her only rational choice is to choose \\(t\\). More\nformally, the only states where Ann is rational and her\ntype knows (i.e., is correct and assigns probability 1 to)\nBob\u2019s strategy choice and where Bob is also rational and his\ntype knows Ann\u2019s strategy choices are states where they\nplay either \\((t,l)\\) or \\((b,r)\\), the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of\nthe game.\nA Nash equilibrium is a profile where no player has an\nincentive to unilaterally deviate from his strategy choice. In other\nwords, a Nash equilibrium is a combination of (possibly mixed)\nstrategies such that they all play their best response given the\nstrategy choices of the others. Again, \\((t,l)\\) and \\((b,r)\\) are the\nonly pure-strategy equilibria of the above coordination game. Nash\nequilibrium, and its numerous refinements, is arguably the game\ntheoretical solution concept that has been most used in game theory\n(Aumann & Hart 1994) and philosophy (e.g., famously in Lewis\n1969).\nThe seminal result of Aumann & Brandenburger 1995 provides an\nepistemic characterization of the Nash equilibrium in terms\nof mutual knowledge of strategy choices (and the structure of\nthe game). See, also, Spohn (1982) for an early statement. Before\nstating the theorem, we discuss an example from Aumann &\nBrandenburger (1995) that illustrates the key ideas. Consider the\nfollowing coordination game:\n\n\n \u00a0 B \nA \n\nl r\nu 2,2  0,0 \nd 0,0  1,1 \n\n\n\nFigure 20\n\nThe two pure-strategy Nash equilibria are \\((u,l)\\) and \\((d,r)\\)\n(there is also a mixed-strategy equilibrium). As usual, we fix an\ninformational context for this game. Let \\(\\T\\) be a type space for the\ngame with three types for each player \\(T_A=\\{a_1,a_2, a_3\\}\\) and\n\\(T_B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}\\) with the following type functions:\n\n\n\n\nl r\n\\(b_1\\) 0.5  0.5 \n\\(b_2\\) 0  0 \n\\(b_3\\) 0  0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(b_1\\) 0.5  0 \n\\(b_2\\) 0  0 \n\\(b_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(b_1\\) 0  0 \n\\(b_2\\) 0  0.5 \n\\(b_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\n\n\\(\\lambda_A(a_1)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_A(a_2)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_A(a_3)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nl r\n\\(a_1\\) 0.5  0 \n\\(a_2\\) 0  0.5 \n\\(a_3\\) 0  0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(a_1\\) 0.5  0 \n\\(a_2\\) 0  0 \n\\(a_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(a_1\\) 0  0 \n\\(a_2\\) 0  0.5 \n\\(a_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\n\n\\(\\lambda_B(b_1)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_B(b_2)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_B(b_3)\\)\n\n\nFigure 21\n\nConsider the state \\((d,r,a_3,b_3)\\). Both \\(a_3\\) and \\(b_3\\) correctly\nbelieve (i.e., assign probability 1 to) that the outcome is \\((d,r)\\)\n(we have \\(\\lambda_A(a_3)(r)=\\lambda_B(b_3)(d)=1\\)). This fact is not\ncommon knowledge: \\(a_3\\) assigns a 0.5 probability to Bob being of type\n\\(b_2\\), and type \\(b_2\\) assigns a 0.5 probability to Ann playing\n\\(l\\). Thus, Ann does not know that Bob knows that she is playing \\(r\\)\n(here, \u201cknowledge\u201d is identified with \u201cprobability\n1\u201d as it is in Aumann & Brandenburger 1995). Furthermore,\nwhile it is true that both Ann and Bob are rational, it is not common\nknowledge that they are rational. Indeed, the type \\(a_3\\) assigns a 0.5\nprobability to Bob being of type \\(b_2\\) and choosing \\(r\\); however, this\nis irrational since \\(b_2\\) believes that both of Ann\u2019s options\nare equally probable.\nThe example above is a situation where there is mutual knowledge of\nthe choices of the players. Indeed, it is not hard to see that in any\ntype space for a 2-player game \\(G\\), if \\((s,t)\\) is a state where there\nis mutual knowledge that player \\(i\\) is choosing \\(s_i\\) and the players\nare rational, then, \\(s\\) constitutes a (pure-strategy) Nash\nEquilibrium. There is a more general theorem concerning mixed strategy\nequilibrium. Recall that a conjecture for player \\(i\\) is a probability\nmeasure over the strategy choices of her opponents.\n\nTheorem 5.1  (Aumann & Brandenburger 1995: Theorem A)\nSuppose that \\(G\\) is a 2-person strategic game, \\((p_1,p_2)\\) are\nconjectures for players 1 and 2, and \\(\\T\\) is a type space for \\(G\\). If\n\\((s,t)\\) is a state in \\(\\T\\) where for \\(i=1,2\\), \\(t_i\\) assigns\nprobability 1 to the events (a) both players are rational (i.e.,\nmaximize expected utility), (b) the game is \\(G\\) and (c) for \\(i=1,2\\),\nplayer \\(i\\)\u2019s conjecture is \\(p_i\\), then \\((p_1, p_2)\\) constitutes\na Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe general version of this result, for arbitrary finite number of\nagents and allowing for mixed strategies, requires common\nknowledge of conjectures, i.e., of each player\u2019s\nprobabilistic beliefs in the other\u2019s choices. See Aumann &\nBrandenburger (1995: Theorem B) for precise formulation of the result,\nand, again, Spohn (1982) for an early version. See, also, Perea (2007)\nand Tan & Werlang (1988) for similar results about the Nash\nequilibrium.\n5.1.2 Philosophical Issues\nThis epistemic characterization of Nash equilibrium requires\nmutual knowledge and rather than beliefs. The result fails\nwhen agents can be mistaken about the strategy choice of the\nothers. This has lead some authors to criticize this epistemic\ncharacterization: See Gintis (2009) and Bruin (2010), for\ninstance. How could the players ever know what the others are\nchoosing? Is it not contrary to the very idea of a game, where the\nplayers are free to choose whatever they want (Baltag et\nal. 2009)?\nOne popular response to this criticism (Brandenburger 2010; Perea\n2012) is that the above result tells us something about Nash\nequilibrium as a solution concept, namely that it\nalleviates strategic uncertainty. Indeed, returning to the\nterminology introduced in Section 1.3, the\nepistemic conditions for Nash equilibrium are those that correspond to\nthe ex post state of information disclosure, \u201cwhen all\nis said and done\u201d, to put it figuratively. When players have\nreached full knowledge of what the others are going to do, there is\nnothing left to think about regarding the other players as rational,\ndeliberating agents. The consequences of each of the players\u2019\nactions are now certain. The only task that remains is to compute\nwhich action is recommended by the adopted choice rule, and this does\nnot involve any specific information about the other players\u2019\nbeliefs. Their choices are fixed, after all.\nThe idea here is not to reject the epistemic characterization of\nNash Equilibrium on the grounds that it rests on unrealistic\nassumptions, but, rather, to view it as a lesson learned about Nash\nEquilibrium itself. From an epistemic point of view, where one is\nfocused on strategic reasoning about what others are going to\ndo and are thinking, this solution concepts might be of less\ninterest.\nThere is another important lesson to draw from this epistemic\ncharacterization result. The widespread idea that game theory\n\u201cassumes common knowledge of rationality\u201d, perhaps in\nconjunction with the extensive use of equilibrium concepts in\ngame-theoretic analysis, has lead to misconception that the Nash\nEquilibrium either requires common knowledge of rationality,\nor that common knowledge of rationality is sufficient for the players\nto play according to a Nash equilibrium. To be sure, game theoretic\nmodels do assume that the structure of the game is common knowledge\n(though, see Section 5.3). Nonetheless, the\nabove result shows that both of these ideas are incorrect:\n\n\nCommon knowledge of rationality is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor Nash Equilibrium.\n\nIn fact, as we just stressed, Nash equilibrium can be played under\nfull uncertainty, and a fortiori under higher-order\nuncertainty, about the rationality of others.\n5.1.3 Remarks on \u201cModal\u201d Characterizations of Nash Equilibrium\nIn recent years, a number of so-called \u201cmodal\u201d\ncharacterizations of Nash Equilibrium have been proposed, mostly using\ntechniques from modal logic (see Hoek & Pauly 2007 for\ndetails). These results typically devise a modal logical language to\ndescribe games in strategic form, typically including modalities for\nthe players\u2019 actions and preference, and show that the notion of\nprofile being a Nash Equilibrium language is definable in\nsuch a language.\nMost of these characterizations are not epistemic, and thus fall\noutside the scope of this entry. In context of this entry, it is\nimportant to note that most of these results aim at something\ndifferent than the epistemic characterization which we are discussing\nin this section. Mostly developed in Computer Sciences, these logical\nlanguages have been used to verify properties of multi-agents systems,\nnot to provide epistemic foundations to this solution\nconcept. However, note that in recent years, a number of logical\ncharacterizations of Nash equilibrium do explicitly use epistemic\nconcepts (see, for example, van Benthem et al. 2009; Lorini &\nSchwarzentruber 2010).\n5.2 Incorporating Admissibility and \u201cCautious\u201d Beliefs\nIt is not hard to find a game and an informational context where\nthere is at least one player without a unique \u201crational\nchoice\u201d. How should a rational player incorporate the\ninformation that more than one action is classified as\n\u201cchoice-worthy\u201d or \u201crationally permissible\u201d\n(according to some choice rule) for her opponent(s)? In such a\nsituation, it is natural to require that the player does not rule\nout the possibility that her opponent will pick a\n\u201cchoice-worthy\u201d option. More generally, the players should\nbe \u201ccautious\u201d about which of their opponents\u2019\noptions they rule out.\nAssuming that the players\u2019 beliefs are \u201ccautious\u201d\nis naturally related to weak dominance (recall the characterization of\nweak dominance, Section 3.2\nin which a strategy is weakly dominated iff it does not maximize\nexpected utility with respect to any full support probability\nmeasure). A key issue in epistemic game theory is the epistemic\nanalysis of iterated removal of weakly dominated strategies. Many\nauthors have pointed out puzzles surrounding such an analysis (Asheim\n& Dufwenberg 2003; Brandenburger, Friedenberg & Keisler 2008;\nCubitt & Sugden 1994; Samuelson 1992). For example, Samuelson\n(1992) showed (among other things) that the analogue of Theorem 4.1 is\nnot true for iterated removal of weakly dominated strategies. The main\nproblem is illustrated by the following game:\n\n\n \u00a0 Bob \nAnn \n\nl r\nu 1,1  1,0 \nd 1,0  0,1 \n\n\n\nFigure 22\n\nIn the above game, \\(d\\) is weakly dominated by \\(u\\) for Ann. If Bob\nknows that Ann is rational (in the sense that she will not choose a\nweakly dominated strategy), then he can rule out option \\(d\\). In the\nsmaller game, action \\(r\\) is now strictly dominated by \\(l\\) for Bob. If\nAnn knows that Bob is rational and that Bob knows that she is rational\n(and so, rules out option \\(d\\)), then she can rule out option\n\\(r\\). Assuming that the above reasoning is transparent to both Ann and\nBob, it is common knowledge that Ann will play \\(u\\) and Bob will play\n\\(l\\). But now, what is the reason for Bob to rule out the possibility\nthat Ann will play \\(d\\)? He knows that Ann knows that he is going to\nplay \\(l\\) and both \\(u\\) and \\(d\\) are best responses to \\(l\\). The problem\nis that assuming that the players\u2019 beliefs are cautious\nconflicts with the logic of iterated removal of weakly dominated\nstrategies. This issue is nicely described in a well-known microeconomics\ntextbook:\n\n[T]he argument for deletion of a weakly dominated strategy for\nplayer \\(i\\) is that he contemplates the possibility that every strategy\ncombination of his rivals occurs with positive probability. However,\nthis hypothesis clashes with the logic of iterated deletion, which\nassumes, precisely that eliminated strategies are not expected to\noccur. (Mas-Colell, Winston, & Green 1995: 240)\n\nThe extent of this conflict is nicely illustrated in Samuelson\n(1992). In particular, Samuelson (1992) shows that there is no\nepistemic-probability \nmodel[14]\n of the above game with\na state satisfying common knowledge of rationality (where\n\u201crationality\u201d means that players do not choose weakly\ndominated strategies). Prima facie, this is puzzling: What\nabout the epistemic-probability model consisting of a single state \\(w\\)\nassigned the profile \\((u, l)\\)? Isn\u2019t this a model of the above\ngame where there is a state satisfying common knowledge that the\nplayers do not choose weakly dominated strategies? The problem is that\nthe players do not have \u201ccautious\u201d beliefs in this model\n(in particular, Bob\u2019s beliefs are not cautious in the sense\ndescribed below). Recall that having a cautious belief means that a\nplayer cannot know which options her opponent(s)\nwill \npick[15]\n from a set of choice-worthy options (in the\nabove game, if Ann knows that Bob is choosing \\(l\\), then both\n\\(u\\) and \\(d\\) are \u201cchoice-worthy\u201d, so Bob\ncannot know that Ann is choosing \\(u\\)). This suggests an\nadditional requirement on a game model: Let \\(\\M=\\epprobmodel\\) be an\nepistemic-probability model. For each action \\(a\\in \\cup_{i\\in\\Agt}\nS_i\\), let \\({[\\![{a}]\\!]}=\\{w \\mid (\\sigma(w))_i=a\\}\\).\nIf \\(a\\in S_i\\) is rational for player \\(i\\) at state\n\\(w\\), then for all players \\(j\\ne i\\), \\({[\\![{a}]\\!]}\\cap \\Pi_j(w)\\ne\n\\emptyset\\).\nThis means that a player cannot know that her opponent\nwill not choose an action at a state \\(w\\) which is deemed rational\n(according to some choice rule). This property is called\n\u201cprivacy of tie-breaking\u201d by Cubitt and Sugden (2011: 8)\nand \u201cno extraneous beliefs\u201d by Asheim and Dufwenberg\n(2003).[16]\n For an extended discussion of the above\nassumption see Cubitt & Sugden (2011).\nGiven the above considerations, the epistemic analysis of iterated\nweak dominance is not a straightforward adaptation of the analysis of\niterated strict dominance discussed in the previous section. In\nparticular, any such analysis must resolve the conflict between\nstrategic reasoning where players rule out certain strategy\nchoices of their opponent(s) and admissibility considerations where\nplayers must consider all of their opponents\u2019\noptions possible. A number of authors have developed\nframeworks that do resolve this conflict (Brandenburger et al. 2008;\nAsheim & Dufwenberg 2003; Halpern & Pass 2009). We sketch one\nof these solutions below:\nThe key idea is to represent the players\u2019 beliefs as\na lexicographic probability system (LPS). An LPS is a finite\nsequence of probability measures \\((p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n)\\) with supports\n(The support of a probability measure \\(p\\) defined on\na set of states \\(W\\) is the set of all states that have nonzero\nprobability; formally, \\(Supp(p)=\\{w \\mid p(w)>0\\}\\)) that do not\noverlap. This is interpreted as follows: if \\((p_1,\\ldots,p_n)\\)\nrepresents Ann\u2019s beliefs, then \\(p_1\\) is Ann\u2019s\n\u201cinitial hypothesis\u201d about what Bob is going to do, \\(p_2\\)\nis Ann\u2019s secondary hypothesis, and so on. In the above game, we\ncan describe Bob\u2019s beliefs as follows: his initial hypothesis\nis that Ann will choose \\(U\\) with probability 1 and his secondary\nhypothesis is that she will choose \\(D\\) with probability 1. The\ninterpretation is that, although Bob does not rule out the possibility\nthat Ann will choose \\(D\\) (i.e., choose irrationally), he does consider\nit infinitely less likely than her choosing \\(U\\) (i.e.,\nchoosing rationally).\nSo, representing beliefs as lexicographic probability measures\nresolves the conflict between strategic reasoning and the assumption\nthat players do not play weakly dominated strategies. However, there\nis another, more fundamental, issue that arises in the epistemic\nanalysis of iterated weak dominance:\n\nUnder admissibility, Ann considers everything possible. But this is\nonly a decision-theoretic statement. Ann is in a game, so we imagine\nshe asks herself: \u201cWhat about Bob? What does he consider\npossible?\u201d If Ann truly considers everything possible, then it\nseems she should, in particular, allow for the possibility that Bob\ndoes not! Alternatively put, it seems that a full analysis of the\nadmissibility requirement should include the idea that other players\ndo not conform to the requirement.  (Brandenburger et al. 2008:\n313)\n\nThere are two main ingredients to the epistemic characterization of\niterated weak dominance. The first is to represent the players\u2019\nbeliefs as lexicographic probability systems. The second is to use a\nstronger notion of belief: A player assumes an event\n\\(E\\) provided \\(E\\) is infinitely more likely than \\(\\overline{E}\\) (on\nfinite spaces, this means each state in \\(E\\) is infinitely more likely\nthan states not in \\(E\\)). The key question is: What is the precise\nrelationship between the event \u201crationality and common\nassumption of rationality\u201d and the strategies that survive\niterated removal of weakly dominated strategies? The precise answer\nturns out to be surprisingly subtle\u2014the details are beyond the\nscope of this article (see Brandenburger et al. 2008).\n5.3 Incorporating Unawareness\nThe game models introduced in Section 2 have\nbeen used to describe the uncertainty that the players have about what\ntheir opponents are going to do and are thinking in a game\nsituation. In the analyses provided thus far, the structure\nof the game (i.e., who is playing, what are the preferences of the\ndifferent players, and which actions are available) is assumed to be\ncommon knowledge among the players. However, there are many situations\nwhere the players do not have such complete information about\nthe game. There is no inherent difficulty in using the models\nfrom Section 2 to describe situations where\nplayers are not perfectly informed about the structure of the\ngame (for example, where there is some uncertainty about available\nactions).\nThere is, however, a foundational issue that arises here. Suppose\nthat Ann considers it impossible that her opponent will\nchoose action \\(a\\). Now, there are many reasons why Ann would hold such\nan opinion. On the one hand, Ann may know something about what her\nopponent is going to do or is thinking which allows her to rule out\naction \\(a\\) as a live possibility\u2014i.e., given all the evidence\nAnn has about her opponent, she concludes that action \\(a\\) is just not\nsomething her opponent will do. On the other hand, Ann may not even\nconceive of the possibility that her opponent will choose action\n\\(a\\). She may have a completely different model of the game in mind\nthan her opponents. The foundational question is: Can the game models\nintroduced in Section 2 faithfully represent\nthis latter type of uncertainty?\nThe question is not whether one can formally describe what Ann\nknows and believes under the assumption that she considers it\nimpossible that her opponent will choose action \\(a\\). Indeed, an\nepistemic-probability model where Ann assigns probability zero to the\nevent that her opponent chooses action \\(a\\) is a perfectly good\ndescription of Ann\u2019s epistemic state. The problem is that this\nmodel blurs an important distinction between Ann\nbeing unaware that action \\(a\\) is a live possibility and\nAnn ruling out that action \\(a\\) is a viable option for her\nopponent. This distinction is illustrated by the following snippet\nfrom the well-known Sherlock Holmes\u2019 short story Silver Blaze\n(Doyle 1894):\n\n\u2026I saw by the inspector\u2019s face that his attention had\nbeen keenly aroused.  \u201cYou consider that to be\nimportant?\u201d he [Inspector Gregory] asked.\n\u201cExceedingly so.\u201d \u201cIs there any point to which\nyou would wish to draw my attention?\u201d \u201cTo the\ncurious incident of the dog in the night-time.\u201d \u201cThe\ndog did nothing in the night-time.\u201d \u201cThat was the\ncurious incident,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThe point is that Holmes is aware of a particular event (\u201cthe\ndog not barking\u201d) and uses this to come to a conclusion. The\ninspector is not aware of this event, and so cannot (without\nHolmes\u2019 help) come to the same conclusion. This is true of many\ndetective stories: clever detectives not only have the ability to\n\u201cconnect the dots\u201d, but they are also aware of\nwhich dots need to be connected. Can we describe the inspector\u2019s\nunawareness in an epistemic \nmodel?[17]\nSuppose that \\(U_i(E)\\) is the event that the player \\(i\\) is unaware\nof the event \\(E\\). Of course, if \\(i\\) is unaware of \\(E\\) then \\(i\\) does\nnot know that \\(E\\) is true (\\(U_i(E)\\subseteq\n\\overline{K_i(E)}\\), where \\(\\overline{X}\\) denotes the complement\nof the event \\(X\\)). Recall that in epistemic models (where the\nplayers\u2019 information is described by partitions), we have the\nnegative introspection property:\n\n\\[\\overline{K_i(E)}\\subseteq K_i(\\overline{K_i(E)}).\\] \n\nThis means that if \\(i\\) is unaware of \\(E\\),\nthen \\(i\\) knows that she does not know that \\(E\\). Thus, to capture a\nmore natural definition of \\(U_i(E)\\) where \n\n\\[U_i(E) \\subseteq \\overline{K_i(E)} \\cap \\overline{K_i(\\overline{K_i(E)})},\\] \n\nwe need to\nrepresent the players\u2019 knowledge in a possibility\nstructure where the \\(K_i\\) operators do not necessarily satisfy\nnegative introspection. A possibility structure is a tuple \\(\\langle W,\n\\{P_i\\}_{i\\in\\A}, \\sigma\\rangle\\) where \\(P_i:W\\rightarrow \\pow(W)\\). The\nonly difference with an epistemic model is that the \\(P_i(w)\\) do not\nnecessarily form a partition of \\(W\\). We do not go into details\nhere\u2014see Halpern (1999) for a complete discussion of possibility\nstructures and how they relate to epistemic models. The knowledge\noperator is defined as it is for epistemic models: for each event \\(E\\),\n\\(K_i(E)=\\{w \\mid P_i(w)\\subseteq E\\}\\). However, S. Modica and\nA. Rustichini (1994, 1999) argue that even the more general\npossibility structures cannot be used to describe a player\u2019s\nunawareness.\nA natural definition of unawareness on possibility structures is:\n\n\\[U(E) = \\overline{K(E)} \\cap \\overline{K(\\overline{K(E)})} \\cap\n\\overline{K(\\overline{K(\\overline{K(E)})}}\\cap \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThat is, an agent is unaware of \\(E\\) provided the agent does not\nknow that \\(E\\) obtains, does not know that she does not know that \\(E\\)\nobtains, and so on. Modica and Rustichini use a variant of the above\nSherlock Holmes story to show that there is a problem with this\ndefinition of unawareness.\nSuppose there are two signals: A dog barking (\\(d\\)) and a cat\nhowling (\\(c\\)). Furthermore, suppose there are three states \\(w_1\\),\n\\(w_2\\) in which the dog barks and \\(w_3\\) in which the cat howls. The\nevent that there is no intruder is \\(E=\\{w_1\\}\\) (the lack of the two\nsignals indicates that there was no\nintruder[18]).\n The following possibility structure\n(where there is an arrow from state \\(w\\) to state \\(v\\) provided \\(v\\in\nP(w)\\)) describes the inspector\u2019s epistemic state:\n\n\nFigure 23\n\nConsider the following calculations:\n\n\\(K(E)=\\{w_2\\}\\) (at \\(w_2\\), Watson knows there is a human intruder)\nand \\(-K(E)=\\{w_1,w_3\\}\\)\n\\(K(-K(E))=\\{w_3\\}\\) (at \\(w_3\\), Watson knows that she does not know\n\\(E\\)), and \\(-K(-K(E))=\\{w_1,w_2\\}\\).\n\\(-K(E)\\cap -K(-K(E))=\\{w_1\\}\\) and, in fact, \\(\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty\n(-K)^i(E)=\\{w_1\\}\\)\nLet \\(U(F)=\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty (-K)^i(F)\\). Then,\n\n\\(U(\\emptyset)=U(W)=U(\\{w_1\\})=U(\\{w_2,w_3\\})=\\emptyset\\)\n\\(U(E)=U(\\{w_3\\})=U(\\{w_1,w_3\\})=U(\\{w_1,w_2\\}=\\{w_1\\}\\)\n\n\nSo, \\(U(E)=\\{w_1\\}\\) and \\(U(U(E))=U(\\{w_1\\})=\\emptyset\\). This means\nthat at state \\(w_1\\), the Inspector is unaware of \\(E\\), but is not\nunaware that he is unaware of \\(E\\). More generally, Dekel et al. (1998)\nshow that there is no nontrivial unawareness operator \\(U\\) satisfying\nthe following properties:\n\n\\(U(E) \\subseteq \\overline{K(E)}\\cap \\overline{K(E)}\\)\n\\(K(U(E))=\\emptyset\\)\n\\(U(E)\\subseteq U(U(E))\\)\n\nThere is an extensive literature devoted to developing models that\ncan represent the players\u2019 unawareness. See Board, Chung, &\nSchipper (2011); Chen, Ely, & Luo (2012); E. Dekel et al. (1998);\nHalpern (2001a); Halpern & Rego (2008); and Heifetz, Meier, &\nSchipper (2006) for a discussion of issues related to this entry.

A Paradox of Self-Reference in Game Models\nThe first step in any epistemic analysis of a game is to describe\nthe players\u2019 knowledge and beliefs using (a possible variant of)\none of the models introduced in Section 2. As we\nnoted already in Section 2.2, there will be\nstatements about what the players know and believe about the game\nsituation and about each other that are commonly known in some models\nbut not in others.\n\nIn any particular structure, certain beliefs, beliefs about belief,\n\u2026, will be present and others won\u2019t be. So, there is an\nimportant implicit assumption behind the choice of a structure. This\nis that it is \u201ctransparent\u201d to the players that the\nbeliefs in the type structure\u2014and only those beliefs\u2014are\npossible \u2026.The idea is that there is a \u201ccontext\u201d to\nthe strategic situation (e.g., history, conventions, etc.) and this\n\u201ccontext\u201d causes the players to rule out certain\nbeliefs. (Brandenburger & Friedenberg 2010: 801)\n\nRuling out certain configurations of beliefs\nconstitute substantive assumptions about the players\u2019\nreasoning during the decision making process. In other words,\nsubstantive assumptions are about how, and how much, information is\nimparted to the agents, over and above those that are intrinsic to the\nmathematical formulation of the structures used to describe the\nplayers\u2019 information. It is not hard to see that one always\nfinds substantive assumptions in finite structures: Given a countably\ninfinite set of atomic propositions, for instance, in finite\nstructures it will always be common knowledge that some logically\nconsistent combination of these basic facts are not realized,\nand a fortiori for logically consistent configurations of\ninformation and higher-order information about these basic facts. On\nthe other hand, monotonicity of the belief/knowledge operator is a\ntypical example of an assumption that is not\nsubstantive. More generally, there are no models of games, as we\ndefined in Section 2, where it is not common\nknowledge that the players believe all the logical consequences of\ntheir beliefs.[19]\nCan we compare models in terms of the number of substantive\nassumptions that are made? Are there models that make no, or at least\nas few as possible, substantive assumptions? These questions have been\nextensively discussed in the epistemic foundations of game\ntheory\u2014see the discussion in Samuelson (1992) and the references\nin Moscati (2009). Intuitively, a structure without any substantive\nassumptions must represent all possible states of (higher-order)\ninformation. Whether such a structure exists will depend, in part, on\nhow the players\u2019 informational attitudes are\nrepresented\u2014e.g., as (conditional/lexicographic) probability\nmeasures or set-valued knowledge/belief functions. These questions\nhave triggered interest in the existence of \u201crich\u201d models\ncontaining most, if not all, possible configurations of (higher-order)\nknowledge and beliefs.\nThere are different ways to understand what it means for a\nstructure to minimize the substantive assumptions about the\nplayers\u2019 higher-order information. We do not attempt a complete\noverview of this interesting literature here (see Brandenburger &\nKeisler (2006: sec. 11) and Siniscalchi (2008: sec. 3) for discussion\nand pointers to the relevant results). One approach considers the\nspace of all (Harsanyi type-/Kripke-/epistemic-plausibility-)\nstructures and tries to find a single structure that, in some suitable\nsense, \u201ccontains\u201d all other structures. Such a structure,\noften called called a universal structure (or a terminal\nobject in the language of category theory), if it exists,\nincorporates any substantive assumption that an analyst can\nimagine. Such structure have been shown to exists for Harsanyi type\nspaces (Mertens & Zamir 1985; Brandenburger & Dekel 1993). For\nKripke structures, the question has been answered in the negative\n(Heifetz & Samet 1998; Fagin, Geanakoplos, Halpern, & Vardi\n1999; Meier 2005), with some qualifications regarding the language\nthat is used to describe them (Heifetz 1999; Roy & Pacuit\n2013).\nA second approach takes an internal perspective by asking\nwhether, for a fixed set of states or types, the agents are\nmaking any substantive assumptions about what their opponents know or\nbelieve. The idea is to identify (in a given model) a set of\npossible conjectures about the players. For example, in a\nknowledge structure based on a set of states \\(W\\) this might be the set\nof all subsets of \\(W\\) or the set definable subsets of \\(W\\) in some\nsuitable logical language. A space is said to be complete if\neach agent correctly takes into account each possible conjecture about\nher opponents. A simple counting argument shows that there cannot\nexist a complete structure when the set of conjectures is all\nsubsets of the set of states (Brandenburger 2003). However, there is a\ndeeper result here which we discuss below.\nThe Brandenburger-Keisler Paradox\nAdam Brandenburger and H. Jerome Keisler (2006) introduce the\nfollowing two person, Russel-style paradox. The statement of the\nparadox involves two concepts: beliefs and\nassumptions. An assumption is a player\u2019s strongest\nbelief: it is a set of states that implies all other beliefs at a\ngiven state. We will say more about the interpretation of an\nassumption below. Suppose there are two players, Ann and Bob, and\nconsider the following description of beliefs.\n\n(S)\nAnn believes that Bob assumes that Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong.\n\n\nA paradox arises by asking the question\n\n(Q)\nDoes Ann believe that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong?\n\nTo ease the discussion, let \\(C\\) be Bob\u2019s assumption in (S):\nthat is, \\(C\\) is the statement \u201cAnn believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is wrong.\u201d So, (Q) asks whether \\(C\\) is true or\nfalse. We will argue that \\(C\\) is true if, and only if, \\(C\\) is\nfalse.\nSuppose that \\(C\\) is true. Then, Ann does believe that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is wrong, and, by introspection, she believes that she\nbelieves this. That is to say, Ann believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect. Furthermore, according to (S), Ann believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is \\(C\\). So, Ann, in fact, believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is correct (she believes Bob\u2019s assumption is \\(C\\) and\nthat \\(C\\) is correct). So, \\(C\\) is false.\nSuppose that \\(C\\) is false. This means that Ann believes that\nBob\u2019s assumption is correct. That is, Ann believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect (By (S), Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is\n\\(C\\)). Furthermore, by (S), we have that Ann believes that Bob\nassumes that Ann believes that \\(C\\) is wrong. So, Ann believes\nthat she believes that \\(C\\) is correct and she believes that Bob\nassumption is that she believes that \\(C\\) is wrong. So, it is true that\nshe believes Bob\u2019s assumptions is wrong (Ann believes that\nBob\u2019s assumption is she believes that \\(C\\) is wrong, but\nshe believes that is wrong: she believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect). So, \\(C\\) is true.\nBrandenburger and Keisler formalize the above argument in order to\nprove a very strong impossibility result about the existence of\nso-called assumption-complete structures. We need some\nnotation to state this result. It will be most convenient to work in\nqualitative type spaces for two players\n(Definition 2.7). A qualitative type space\nfor two players (cf. Definition 2.7. The set\nof states is not important in what follows, so we leave it out) is a\nstructure \\(\\langle \\{T_A, T_B\\}, \\{\\lambda_A, \\lambda_B\\}\\rangle\\)\nwhere\n\n\\[\\lambda_A:T_A\\rightarrow \\pow(T_B)\\qquad\\lambda_B:T_B\\rightarrow\\pow(T_A)\\]\n\nA set of conjectures about Ann is a subset\n\\(\\C_A\\subseteq \\pow(T_A)\\) (similarly, the set of conjectures about Bob\nis a subset \\(\\C_B\\subseteq \\pow(T_B)\\)). A structure \\(\\langle \\{T_A,\nT_B\\}, \\{\\lambda_A, \\lambda_B\\}\\rangle\\) is said to\nbe assumption-complete for the conjectures \\(\\C_A\\) and\n\\(\\C_B\\) provided for each conjecture in \\(\\C_A\\) there is a type that\nassumes that conjecture (similarly for Bob). Formally, for each\n\\(Y\\in\\C_B\\) there is a \\(t_0\\in T_A\\) such that \\(\\lambda_A(t_0)=Y\\), and\nsimilarly for Bob. As we remarked above, a simple counting argument\nshows that when \\(\\C_A=\\pow(T_A)\\) and \\(\\C_B=\\pow(T_B)\\), then\nassumption-complete models only exist in trivial cases. A much deeper\nresult is:\n\nTheorem 6.1 (Brandenburger & Keisler 2006: Theorem 5.4)\nThere is no assumption-complete type structure for the set of\nconjectures that contains the first-order definable subsets.\n\nSee the supplement for a discussion of the proof of this theorem\n(see Section 2).\nConsult Pacuit (2007) and  Abramsky & Zvesper (2010) for an extensive analysis and\ngeneralization of this result. But, it is not all bad news: Mariotti,\nMeier, & Piccione (2005) construct a complete structure where the\nset of conjectures are compact subsets of some well-behaved\ntopological space.\n7. Concluding Remarks\nThe epistemic view on games is that players should be seen as\nindividual decision makers, choosing what to do on the basis of their\nown preferences and the information they have in specific\ninformational contexts. What decision they will make\u2014the\ndescriptive question\u2014or what decision they should make\u2014the\nnormative question, depends on the decision-theoretic choice rule that\nthe player use, or should use, in a given context. We conclude with\ntwo general methodological issues about epistemic game theory and some\npointers to further reading.\n7.1 What is an epistemic game theory trying to accomplish?\nCommon knowledge of rationality is an informal assumption that game\ntheorists, philosophers and other social scientists often appeal to\nwhen analyzing social interactive situations. The epistemic program in\ngame theory demonstrates that there are many ways to understand what\nexactly it means to assume that there is \u201ccommon\nknowledge/belief of rationality\u201d in a game situation.\nBroadly speaking, much of the epistemic game theory literature is\nfocused on two types of projects. The goal of the first project is to\nmap out the relationship between different mathematical\nrepresentations of what the players know and believe about each other\nin a game situation. Research along these lines not only raises\ninteresting technical questions about how to compare and contrast\ndifferent mathematical models of the players\u2019 epistemic states,\nbut it also highlights the benefits and limits of an epistemic\nanalysis of games. The second project addresses the nature of rational\nchoice in game situations. The importance of this project is nicely\nexplained by Wolfgang Spohn:\n\n\u2026game theory\u2026is, to put it strongly, confused about\nthe rationality concept appropriate to it, its assumptions about its\nsubjects (the players) are very unclear, and, as a consequence, it is\nunclear about the decision rules to be applied\u2026.The basic\ndifficulty in defining rational behavior in game situations is the\nfact that in general each player\u2019s strategy will depend on his\nexpectations about the other players\u2019 strategies. Could we\nassume that his expectations were given, then his problem of strategy\nchoice would become an ordinary maximization problem: he could simply\nchoose a strategy maximizing his own payoff on the assumption that the\nother players would act in accordance with his given expectations. But\nthe point is that game theory cannot regard the players\u2019\nexpectations about each other\u2019s behavior as given; rather, one\nof the most important problems for game theory is precisely to decide\nwhat expectations intelligent players can rationally entertain about\nother intelligent players\u2019 behavior. (Spohn 1982: 267)\n\nMuch of the work in epistemic game theory can be viewed as an\nattempt to use precise representations of the players\u2019 knowledge\nand beliefs to help resolve some of the confusion alluded to in the\nabove quote.\n7.2 Alternatives to maximizing expected utility\nIn an epistemic analysis of a game, the specific recommendations or\npredictions for the players\u2019 choices are derived from\ndecision-theoretic choice rules. Maximization of expected utility, for\ninstance, underlies most of the results in the contemporary literature\non the epistemic foundations of game theory. From a methodological\nperspective, however, the choice rule that the modeler assumes the\nplayers are following is simply a parameter that can be varied. In\nrecent years, there have been some initial attempts to develop\nepistemic analyses with alternative choice rules, for\ninstance minregret Halpern & Pass (2009).\n7.3 Further reading\nThe reader interested in more extensive coverage of all or some of\nthe topics discussed in this entry should consult the following\narticles and books.\n\nLogic in Games by Johan van Benthem: This book uses the\ntools of modal logic broadly conceived to discuss many of the issues\nraised in this entry (2014, MIT Press).\nThe Language of Game Theory by Adam Brandenburger: A\ncollection of Brandenburger\u2019s key papers on epistemic game\ntheory (2014, World Scientific Series in Economic Theory).\nEpistemic Game Theory by Eddie Dekel and Marciano\nSiniscalchi: A survey paper aimed at economists covering the main\ntechnical results of epistemic game theory (2014, Available online).\nEpistemic Game Theory: Reasoning and Choice by\nAndr\u00e9s Perea: A non-technical introduction to epistemic game\ntheory (2012, Cambridge University Press).\nThe Bounds of Reason: Game Theory and the Unification of the\nBehavioral Sciences by Herbert Gintis: This book offers a broad\noverview of the social and behavioral science using the ideas of\nepistemic game theory (2009, Princeton University Press).\n",
