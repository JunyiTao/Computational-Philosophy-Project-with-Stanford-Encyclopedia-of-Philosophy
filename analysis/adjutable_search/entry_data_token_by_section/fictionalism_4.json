    "main_text": "Some Qualifications and Distinctions || Meaning versus use\n2.3 Meaning versus use\n\nMost hermeneutic fictionalists about some particular discourse hold\nthat although we normally utter sentences within the discourse in a\nfictional spirit, we could, and perhaps sometimes do, use these\nsentences literally. For example, a mathematical fictionalist might\nhold that when we utter \u201cthere are prime numbers\u201d in\nordinary contexts we mean this in a fictional spirit, but add that\nwhen we utter this sentence in the philosophy room we sometimes intend\nto speak literally. But one can at least imagine a different kind of\nhermeneutic fictionalism. Take the case of discourse about fictional\ncharacters. A name like \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 is first introduced\nfor the purposes of story telling and for making claims internal to\nthe story; for example, the claim that SpongeBob lives in a pineapple\nunder the sea. But there is disagreement about the proper account of\nthe use of names of fictional entities extrafictive, non-story-telling\ncontexts, e.g. in \u201cSpongeBob is a better role model than\nSuperman\u201d. Some philosophers hold that this\n\u2018extrafictive\u2019 use of fictional names shows that\n\u2018SpongeBob\u2019 has a reference outside the fiction (for\nexample, that it refers to an abstract entity). Others hold that while\n\u2018SpongeBob\u2019 can be used meaningfully in such contexts, it\nis nonetheless, in such contexts, a mere non-referring empty name,\nalongside \u2018Zeus\u2019 and \u2018Vulcan\u2019. But we can\nimagine a third kind of view, according to which names of fictional\ncharacters are, as it were, only meaningful inside the fiction. Anyone\nattracted to such a view must tell some special story about seeming\nextrafictive truths (Brock 2002). Similarly, and returning to\nfictionalism, one can imagine a fictionalist about some discourse who\ndenies that the relevant sentences even can be meaningfully used\noutside the pretense; who holds that the sentences only have\npretense-uses.\n\nThe view may sound farfetched. But Yablo (1998) comes close to\nsuggesting a view of this sort when he says, after having motivated\nfictionalism about the use of names of cities, that he does not know\nwhat it would be to use \u201cChicago exists\u201d more literally\nthan he already does. Let us call the fictionalism according to which\nthere is a literal use of the sentences in question with which the\nordinary use contrasts use fictionalism; call the other\nmeaning fictionalism. The distinction may correspond to\nArmour-Garb and Woodbridge\u2019s (2015) distinction between\nextrinsic and intrinsic pretense. Armour-Garb and\nWoodbridge say that what characterizes extrinsic pretense is that we\ncould take the utterance made literally, whereas in cases of\nintrinsic pretense, \u201cthe pretense is integral to the utterance\nsaying anything at all\u201d. Use fictionalism is arguably by far the\nmore common doctrine. But it is worth mentioning meaning fictionalism\nas well, both because some fictionalists appear to endorse it, and\nbecause the distinction will be relevant to some of the arguments\nagainst fictionalism. Armour-Garb and Woodbridge call their own brand\nof fictionalism semantic and oppose what they call pragmatic accounts.\n\n\nThere are further distinctions in the general vicinity. Following\nYablo (2001), one can distinguish between the following fictionalist\nviews (about discourse about Xs):\n\n\nInstrumentalism: the speaker is not \u201creally\u201d asserting\nanything, only pretending to do so.\n\nMeta-fictionalism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting that\naccording to a certain fiction, the Xs are so and so.\n\nObject-fictionalism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting\nthat the world is in a certain condition, namely, the condition it\nneeds to be in to make it true in the relevant fiction that the\nXs are so and so.\n\nFiguralism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting that\nsomething is in a certain condition, but perhaps not the\nworld; the Xs are functioning as representational aids in a\nfigurative description of the Ys, where the Ys may\nthemselves be representational aids invoked to help us describe still\nfurther objects.\n\n\nLet us take number discourse as our example, and consider these\nfictionalist views as applied to number discourse. The instrumentalist\nsays that in an utterance of \u201cthe number of apples is\ntwo\u201d, the speaker is merely pretending to assert something;\nnothing is really asserted. The instrumentalist does not present an\nalternative account of what the speaker is doing. The metafictionalist\nsays that something is asserted along the lines of: according to the\nnumber fiction, the number of apples is two. The object fictionalist\nsays that what is asserted is something non-number-involving about the\nreal world \u2014 something which would make it true in the fiction\nthat the number of apples is two: that there is an apple x and\nan apple y such that x and y are distinct and\nnothing distinct from both x and y is an apple. The\ncharacteristic objects of the discourse, the numbers, are mere aids we\nuse to make utterances about how things stand in the real world.\nYablo\u2019s own preferred view, figuralism, is supposed to be a\nclose cousin of object fictionalism, but with an added twist.\nFiguralism does not differ from object fictionalism in what it says\nabout the example used so far. The differences only show up when we\nare considering utterances intuitively about these props themselves,\nthe numbers, such as \u201c7 is smaller than 11\u201d. Sometimes,\nYablo says, numbers \u2014 and other props \u2014 are used as mere\nrepresentational aids, but sometimes they also function as things\nrepresented. (He provides as a comparison \u201cpinpricks of\nconscience register less than pangs of conscience.\u201d) In a\ntypical utterance of \u201cthe number of apples is two\u201d, the\nnumber functions as a representational aid. But in \u201cthere are\nnumbers\u201d as used by the platonist, numbers function as things\nrepresented. And in \u201cthe number of even primes is zero\u201d,\nas a nominalist can be envisaged to use it when doing philosophy,\nsaying something that given her philosophical views is true, they\nfunction both as representational aids (\u201cnumber\u201d) and as\nthings represented (\u201ceven prime\u201d). (Compare also the\ncatalogue of fictionalist views in Kalderon 2005a, ch. 3.) \n\nA broader distinction is that between what can be called content\nfictionalism and force fictionalism. The content\nfictionalist holds that in (ordinary) utterances of sentences of\nD some content is asserted, but what is asserted is something\nother than their literal content. The force fictionalist holds that\nthe content expressed in an (ordinary) utterance of a sentence of\nD is not asserted: instead some other speech act is\nperformed. Instrumentalism is a form of force fictionalism. The other\nforms of fictionalism are in the first instance forms of content\nfictionalism. Notice that content and force fictionalism can be\ncombined. A fictionalist can hold both that in an (ordinary) utterance\nof sentence of D, the literal content of the sentence is\nconveyed but not asserted, and that some content other than the\nliteral content is asserted. This is even a rather natural view: in an\nordinary utterance of a sentence of D, the speaker\npretends-true the literal content of the sentence, and in so doing she\nasserts something other than the literal content.\n\nSometimes when fictionalism is discussed, it is presupposed that\nfictionalism would have to be of the meta-fictionalist variety. This\nis a mistake. There are objections to meta-fictionalism that do not\ngeneralize to other fictionalist theses. Joyce (2005) stresses that\nmeta-fictionalism does not adequately distinguish between telling a\nstory and describing a story. When we engage in fiction we do the\nformer, but the meta-fictionalist has it that we do the latter. Yablo\n(2001) stresses, in the case of mathematical fictionalism, that in\nordinary uses of mathematical sentences, we seem to assert something\napriori and necessary, but it does not seem apriori and necessary that\naccording to the fiction of standard mathematics, things stand\nthus-and-so. Generally, meta-fictionalism forces attention to the\n\u201caccording to the fiction\u2026\u201d-operator, but the\nproblems that arise are beside the point on either of the other\nfictionalist views. (See Kim 2005 for a discussion of some of the\nproblems that arise, having to do with, e.g., the contingent existence\nof fictions.)\n",
