    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cPhilosophy of Economics\u201d consists of inquiries concerning\n(a) rational choice, (b) the appraisal of economic outcomes,\ninstitutions and processes, and (c) the ontology of economic phenomena\nand the possibilities of acquiring knowledge of them. Although these\ninquiries overlap in many ways, it is useful to divide philosophy of\neconomics in this way into three subject matters which can be regarded\nrespectively as branches of action theory, ethics (or normative social\nand political philosophy), and philosophy of science. Economic\ntheories of rationality, welfare, and social choice defend substantive\nphilosophical theses often informed by relevant philosophical\nliterature and of evident interest to those interested in action\ntheory, philosophical psychology, and social and political philosophy.\nEconomics is of particular interest to those interested in\nepistemology and philosophy of science both because of its detailed\npeculiarities and because it possesses many of the overt features of\nthe natural sciences, while its object consists of social\nphenomena.\n",
