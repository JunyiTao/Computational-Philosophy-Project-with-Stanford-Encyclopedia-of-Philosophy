    "main_text": "Characteristic Human Properties || Statistical Normality or Robust Causality\n3.2 Statistical Normality or Robust Causality\n\nBegin, then, with the idea that to provide an account of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d is to circumscribe a set of generalisations concerning\nhumans. An approach of this sort sees the properties thus itemised as\nspecifically \u201chuman\u201d in as far as they are common among\nspecies specimens. So the privilege accorded to these properties is\npurely statistical and \u201cnormal\u201d means statistically\nnormal. Note that taking the set of statistically normal properties of\nhumans as a non-teleological replacement for the fully developed human\nform retains from the original package the possibility of labelling as\n\u201chuman nature\u201d either those properties themselves (TP3) or\ntheir developmental cause (TP2). Either approach avoids the\nclassificatory worries dealt with in\n section 2:\n it presupposes that those organisms whose properties are relevant are\nalready distinguished as such specimens. What is to be explained is,\nthen, the ways humans generally, though not universally, are. And\namong these ways are ways they may share with most specimens of some\nother species, in particular those that belong to the same order\n(primates) and the same class (mammals).\n\nOne should be clear what follows from this interpretation of\n\u201chuman\u201d. The organisms among whom statistical frequency is\nsought range over those generated after speciation around 150,000\nyears ago to those that will exist immediately prior to the\nspecies\u2019 extinction. On the one hand, because of the variability\nintrinsic to species, we are in the dark as to the properties that may\nor may not characterise those organisms that will turn out to be the\nlast of the taxon. On the other hand, the time lag of around 100,000\nyears between the first anatomically modern humans and the general\nonset of behavioural modernity around the beginning of the Upper\nPalaeolithic means that there are likely to be many widespread\npsychological properties of contemporary humans that were not\npossessed by the majority of the species\u2019 specimens during two\nthirds of the species\u2019 history. This is true even if the\npractices seen as the signatures of behavioural modernity (see\n \u00a71.1)\n developed sporadically, disappeared and reappeared at far removed\npoints of time and space over tens of thousands of years before 50,000\nka (McBrearty & Brooks 2000; Sterelny 2011).\n\nAccording to several authors (Machery 2008; 2018; Samuels 2012; Ramsey\n2013), the expression \u201chuman nature\u201d should be used to\ngroup properties that are the focus of much current behavioural,\npsychological and social science. However, as the cognitive and\npsychological sciences are generally interested in present-day humans,\nthere is a mismatch between scientific focus and a grouping criterion\nthat takes in all the properties generally or typically instantiated\nby specimens of the entire taxon. For this reason, the expression\n\u201chuman nature\u201d is likely to refer to properties of an even\nmore temporally restricted set of organisms belonging to the species.\nThat restriction can be thought of in indexical terms, i.e., as a\nrestriction to contemporary humans. However, some authors claim\nexplicitly that their accounts entail that human nature can change\n(Ramsey 2013: 992; Machery 2018: 20). Human nature would then be the\nobject of temporally indexed investigations, as is, for example, the\nweight of individual humans in everyday contexts. (Without temporal\nspecification, there is no determinate answer to a question such as\n\u201cHow much did David Hume weigh?\u201d) An example of\nMachery\u2019s is dark skin colour. This characteristic, he claims,\nceased to be a feature of human nature thus understood 7,000 years\nago, if that was when skin pigmentation became polymorphic. The\nexample indicates that the temporal range may be extremely narrow from\nan evolutionary point of view.\n\nSuch accounts are both compatible with evolutionary theory and\ncoherent. However, in as far as they are mere summary or list\nconceptions, it is unclear what their epistemic value might be. They\nwill tend to accord with everyday common sense, for which \u201chuman\nnature\u201d may in a fairly low-key sense simply be the properties\nthat (contemporary) humans generally tend to manifest (Roughley 2011:\n16). They will also conform to one level of the expression\u2019s use\nin Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340),\nwhich, in an attempt to provide a human \u201cmental geography\u201d\n(1748 [1970: 13]), lists a whole series of features, such as prejudice\n(1739\u201340, I,iii,13), selfishness (III,ii,5), a tendency to\ntemporal discounting (III,ii,7) and an addiction to general rules\n(III,ii,9).\n\nAccounts of this kind have been seen as similar in content to field\nguides for other animals (Machery 2008: 323; Godfrey-Smith 2014: 139).\nAs Hull points out, within a restricted ecological context and a short\nperiod of evolutionary time, the ascription of readily observable\nmorphological or behavioural characteristics to species specimens is a\nstraightforward and unproblematic enterprise (Hull 1987: 175).\nHowever, the analogy is fairly unhelpful, as the primary function of\nassertions in field guides is to provide a heuristics for amateur\nclassification. In contrast, a list conception of the statistically\nnormal properties of contemporary humans presupposes identification of\nthe organisms in question as humans. Moreover, such accounts certainly\ndo not entail easy epistemic access to the properties in question,\nwhich may only be experimentally discovered. Nevertheless, there\nremains something correct about the analogy, as such accounts are a\ncollection of assertions linked only by the fact that they are about\nthe same group of organisms (Sterelny 2018: 123).\n\nMore sophisticated nature documentaries may summarise causal features\nof the lives of animals belonging to specific species. An analogous\nconception of human nature has also been proposed, according to which\nhuman nature is a set of pervasive and robust causal nexuses amongst\nhumans. The list that picks out this set would specify causal\nconnections between antecedent properties, such as having been exposed\nto benzene or subject to abuse as a child, and consequent properties,\nsuch as developing cancer or being aggressive towards one\u2019s own\nchildren (Ramsey 2013: 988ff.). Human nature thus understood would\nhave an explanatory component, a component internal to each item on\nthe list. Human nature itself would, however, not be explanatory, but\nrather the label for a list of highly diverse causal connections.\n\nAn alternative way to integrate an explanatory component in a\nstatistical normality account involves picking out that set of\nstatistically common properties that have a purely evolutionary\nexplanation (Machery 2008; 2018). This reinterpretation of the concept\nof naturalness that featured in the original package (TP1) involves a\ncontrast with social learning. Processes grouped together under this\nlatter description are taken to be alternative explanations to those\nprovided by evolution. However, learning plays a central role, not\nonly in the development of individual humans, but also in the iterated\ninteraction of entire populations with environments structured and\nrestructured through such interaction (Stotz 2010: 488ff.; Sterelny\n2012: 23ff.). Hence, the proposal raises serious epistemic questions\nas to how the distinction is precisely to be drawn and\noperationalised.
