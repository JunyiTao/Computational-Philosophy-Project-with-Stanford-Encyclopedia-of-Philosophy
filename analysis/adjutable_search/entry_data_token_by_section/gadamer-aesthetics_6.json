    "main_text": "The Issue in Question\n8. The Issue in Question\n\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics involve a variety of interlocking\narguments, one of the most significant of which concerns\ndie\u00a0Sache selbst. The term is difficult to\ntranslate, but it refers, loosely speaking, to a work\u2019s\nsubject-matter, to what it addresses or to what issue has been placed\nin question. Philosophical usage of the word evokes phenomenological\nnotions of intentionality: what a work is directed at or points\ntoward. The Sache is not a determinate concept but an area of\nsignificant meaningfulness, a constellation of concerns which orbit\nthe affective, conative, and cognitive complexities of subject-matters\nsuch as grief or love. The Sache underpins Gadamer\u2019s\nclaim that aesthetic experience has a significant cognitive content.\nSubject-matters may transcend an individual work in that no one work\ncan exhaust their significance, but as ideas, Sachen are not\nindependent of the body of works that exemplify them. If they were\nontologically distinct, the idealism Gadamer rejects would be forced\non him, and he would be compelled to argue that art is\nrepresentational, refers to a concept beyond itself and, indeed,\ndisappears into that concept once evoked. Hence, art, in this way of\nunderstanding, becomes philosophy once more. If, however, art is\npresentation, as Gadamer insists, a work\u2019s meaning is not\nindependent of it. Art does not, therefore, copy and thereby represent\na subject-matter, but configures a visual or literary space in which a\nsubject-matter can be summoned. Gadamer counters an ancient line of\nargument that regards art as secondary to, inferior to, and a\ncorrupter of, the real. Contrary to the Platonic tradition, his\nargument implies that art adds to the reality of its\nsubject-matters. Gadamer\u2019s evaluation of the aesthetic contrasts\nvividly with Kant\u2019s in this respect. Kant considers aesthetic\nexperience to be indifferent to whether or not its object is real (cf.\nTM 89). A work\u2019s credibility does not depend on its relationship\nto an original object or co-relative. Whether what is represented\nexists or not is inconsequential. What matters is the aesthetic merit\nof the work, not the strength of its likeness. Should the artwork be\nharmed, the being of the correlative is unaffected. Gadamer\u2019s\npresentational aesthetics is, by contrast, in this regard profoundly\nanti-Platonic and anti-Kantian: for Gadamer a work\u2019s\ndisappearance diminishes the reality of that which presents itself\nthrough it.\n\nAlthough subject-matters transcend the individual works which embody\nthem, they do not exist apart from their historical embodiments.\nMoreover, unlike Platonic forms, subject-matters do not transcend\nhistory but mutate and develop ever new permutations. Any diminishment\nof art diminishes the historical effectiveness of a given\nsubject-matter. Were John Donne\u2019s love poems all lost, our\nunderstanding of the exquisite joys and pains of human love would be\nirreparably diminished. A semi-Platonic argument about\nmimesis reinforces a discernibly non-Platonic argument\nconcerning the historically fluid character of subject-matters. The\nargument that artworks direct us to a subject-matter irrespective of\nwhether they be realist or abstract constructions, suggests a moment\nof return and repetition. An issue, question, or subject-matter is\nrecognized.\n\nWhere something is recognized it has liberated itself from the\nuniqueness and contingency of the circumstances in which it was\nencountered. It is a matter\u00a0neither of there and then, nor of\nhere and now but it is encountered as the very self-same. Thereby it\nbegins to rise to its permanent essence and is detached from anything\nlike a chance encounter. (RB 120)\n\n\nThis passage strengthens the presentational approach to art, but its\nreference to essences requires clarification.\n\nIt is part of the process of recognition that we see things in terms\nof what is permanent and essential unencumbered by the contingent\ncircumstances in which they were seen before and are seen again. What\nimitation reveals is the real essence of the thing. (RB 99)\n\n\nIt is not suggested that we see repeatedly the same essence\nin a work of art. Were this to be suggested, works would become dull\nand uninformative and make no new contribution to a genre.\nGadamer\u2019s insistence is that works should speak directly to and,\nindeed, transform our self-understanding. Such transformative power\nimplies recognising in a work what was previously understood of a\nsubject-matter, but transformed, as if seen for the first time. The\nlife of a subject-matter is one of change and development.\nGadamer\u2019s mimesis argument claims that through repeated\nre-working and re-interpretation a subject-matter not only accrues\nmore aspects, but also, in so doing, they allow that subject-matter to\nbecome more fully what it is. \u201cA work of art belongs so closely\nto what it is related to that it enriches the being of that as if\nthrough a new event of being\u201d (TM 147). The \u201cjoy of\nrecognition is rather the joy of knowing more than is already\nfamiliar.\u201d Artworks allow subject-matters to become more what\nthey are. In conclusion, Gadamer\u2019s phenomenological aesthetics\neffectively destroys the Platonic separation of art and reality.\nArtworks are the sites in which the trans-individual both present and\ntransform themselves. Whereas, as we have seen, for Kant the\ndestruction of an artwork has absolutely no bearing upon the\nobjectivities it represents, we can now understand why Gadamer is\ncommitted to the opposing view that the destruction of an artwork\ndiminishes the reality of the subject-matters that come forth through\nit.\n",
