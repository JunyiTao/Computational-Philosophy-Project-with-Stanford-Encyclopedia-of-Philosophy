    "main_text": "One Ideal among Others\n1. One Ideal among Others\n\nThe Rule of Law is one ideal in an array of values that dominates\nliberal political morality: others include democracy, human rights,\nsocial justice, and economic freedom. The plurality of these values\nseems to indicate that there are multiple ways in which social and\npolitical systems can be evaluated, and these do not necessarily fit\ntidily together. Some legal philosophers (e.g., Raz 1977) insist, as a\nmatter of analytic clarity, that the Rule of Law in particular must be\ndistinguished from democracy, human rights, and social justice. They\nconfine the focus of the Rule of Law to formal and procedural aspects\nof governmental institutions, without regard to the content of the\npolicies they implement. But the point is controversial. As we shall\nsee, some substantive accounts have been developed, which amount in\neffect to the integration of the Rule of Law with some of these other\nideals.\n",
