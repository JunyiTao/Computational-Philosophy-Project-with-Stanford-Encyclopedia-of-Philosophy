    "main_text": "Causality and Cosmology || The Causal Chain\n5.2 The Causal Chain\n\nThese ideas\u2014the series, its vertical pattern, the distinction\nbetween internal and external causes and a transcendent principle of\nthe series\u2014are also elaborated in the Kit\u0101b\nal-I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t (see IV, 9\u201315; IV, 1\u20138 for\nits premises)\u2014 Remarks and Admonitions or\nPointers\u2014as the title of the work is known in English\n\u2014, a work of extreme importance for the Eastern philosophical\ntradition. The I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t argument has been\ndefined as a priori or ontological (Mayer 2001; cf. Marmura\n1980). It originates from the general consideration of \u201cevery\nexistent\u201d: once examined in their essence (min\n\u1e25ay\u1e6fu d\u0101ti-hi), or in isolation, without\nanything other than themselves, all existents either necessarily have\nor do not have existence in themselves: that which exists in itself is\nreal or true (al-\u1e25aqq), it necessarily exists\n(al-w\u0101\u01e7ib al-wu\u01e7\u016bd) and always subsists\n(al-qayy\u016bm: an Islamic theological term); that which\ndoes not have existence in itself is always in need of a connection to\nsomething other, namely a condition (\u0161ar\u1e6d) that\nwill accompany it, both when it is conceived as existent and when\nconceived as non-existent. Thus, conceiving a causal chain means\npositing the existence of something that is prior and external to it.\nIf the connection of the possible with something other than itself\nwere continuously repeated, ad infinitum, each unit in the\nchain would be possible in itself, and the collection\n(\u01e7umla) that the units constitute would also, in itself,\nbe unnecessary. In order to devise a collection of things, possible in\nthemselves but existing, one must conceive of a collection rendered\nnecessary by virtue of something external to it. The propensity to\nexist, which is necessity, is ascribed to the units of a collection,\nand hence to the collection itself, by something that, transcending\nit, is necessary in itself.\n\nThus Avicenna arrives at the idea of an absolute cause which is the\ncause of all things: the series, its units and the relations that bind\nthem to one another. One might posit the existence of something that\ncauses some units and not others, but this would certainly not be the\nabsolute cause, which is a cause that cannot be caused in any way. It\nis an extreme (\u1e6daraf) and therefore neither an\nintermediate element nor an effect. So, every chain (silsila)\nneeds a cause external to it: an extreme\u2014the Necessary Existent\nPrinciple\u2014which is not caused and therefore gives a foundation\nto the causal chain without being part of it. Indeed, in the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t of Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101 Avicenna explicitly states that the flow of\nbeing is \u201cdistinct\u201d (mub\u0101yin) from the\nPrinciple (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 4, 403, 13).\n",
