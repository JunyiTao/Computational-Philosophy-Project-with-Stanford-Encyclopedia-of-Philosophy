Implicit and Explicit Definitions in Allied Fields\n\nPhilosophers, because they do not need to produce operational tests or\ncriteria in the way that psychologists, biologists, and\nanthropologists do, often simply take for granted that everyone knows\nwhat belongs, and does not belong, to the moral domain. This attitude\nfinds expression in the philosopher\u2019s common appeal to\nintuition, or to what everyone agrees about. For example, Michael\nSmith (1994) provides a very detailed analysis of normative reasons,\nbut in distinguishing specifically moral reasons from other sorts of\nreasons, he says only that they are picked out by appeal to a number\nof platitudes. And he makes no effort to provide anything like a\ncomprehensive list of such platitudes. Moreover, it is very likely\nthat there will be disagreement as to what counts as\nplatitudinous. Or, if it is definitional of \u201cplatitude\u201d\nthat it be uncontroversial, it may be that what is platitudinous about\nmorality will be so thin as to fail to separate morality from other\ndomains. Failing to specify which particular criteria one takes to\ngovern one\u2019s own theorizing, and consequently tacitly relying on\nthe idea that everyone already knows what counts as moral, can lead to\na number of problems. One, of course, is a conflation of morality with\nother things (see Machery 2012 on Churchland 2011). Another is that\none mistakes one\u2019s own cultural biases for universal truths\n(Haidt and Kesiber 2010).\n\nBecause theorists in psychology and anthropology often need to design\nquestionnaires and other sorts of probes of the attitudes of subjects,\nthey might be expected to be more sensitive to the need for a\nreasonably clear means of separating moral judgments from other sorts\nof judgments. After all, examining the specifically moral judgments of\nindividuals is one of the most direct means of determining what the\nmoral code of a person or group might be. But despite this\nexpectation, and roughly half a century ago, Abraham Edel (1962: 56)\ndecried the lack of an explicit concern to delimit the domain of\nmorality among anthropologists, writing that \u201cmorality\u2026is\ntaken for granted, in the sense that one can invoke it or refer to it\nat will; but it is not explained, depicted, or analysed\u201d. One\nexplanation for this that Edel suggested is the same as the\nexplanation for the same phenomenon in Philosophy: \u201cit is\nassumed that we all know what morality is and no explicit account need\nbe given\u201d. But the danger for those making this assumption, he\npoints out, is that of \u201cmerging the morality concept with social\ncontrol concepts\u201d. Reinforcing this tendency was the influence,\nin anthropology, of the sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim (1906\n[2009]), for whom morality was simply a matter of how a given society\nenforces whatever social rules it happens to have.\n\nThe failure to offer an operational definition of morality or moral\njudgment may help explain the widespread but dubious assumption in\ncontemporary anthropology, noted by James Laidlaw (2016: 456), that\naltruism is the essential and irreducible core of ethics. But Laidlaw\nalso notes that many of the features of what Bernard Williams (1985)\ndescribed as \u201cthe morality system\u201d\u2014features that\nWilliams himself criticized as the parochial result of a\nsecularization of Christian values\u2014are in fact widely shared\noutside of the West. This state of affairs leads Laidlaw to ask the\ncrucial question: \n\n\nWhich features, formal or substantive, are shared by the\n\u201cmorality system\u201d of the modern West and those of the\nother major agrarian civilizations and literate religions? \n\n\nThis is, to a very close approximation, a request for the definition\nof morality in the descriptive sense.\n\nKlenk (2019) notes that in recent years anthropology has taken what he\nterms an \u201cethical turn\u201d, recognizing moral systems, and\nethics more generally, as a distinct object of anthropological study.\nThis is a move away from the Durkheimian paradigm, and includes the\nstudy of self-development, virtues, habits, and the role of explicit\ndeliberation when moral breakdowns occur. However, Klenk\u2019s\nsurvey of attempts by anthropologists to study morality as an\nindependent domain lead him to conclude that, so far, their efforts do\n\n\n\nnot readily allow a distinction between moral considerations and other\nnormative considerations such as prudential, epistemic, or aesthetic\nones. (2019: 342)\n\n\nIn light of Edel\u2019s worry about a conflation of moral systems\nwith systems of social control, it is interesting to consider Curry\n(2016), who defends the hypothesis that \n\n\nmorality turns out to be a collection of biological and cultural\nsolutions to the problems of cooperation and conflict recurrent in\nhuman social life. (2016: 29) \n\n\nCurry notes that rules related to kinship, mutualism, exchange, and\nvarious forms of conflict resolution appear in virtually all\nsocieties. And he argues that many of them have precursors in animal\nbehavior, and can be explained by appeal to his central hypothesis of\nmorality as a solution to problems of cooperation and conflict\nresolution. He also notes that philosophers, from Aristotle through\nHume, Russell, and Rawls, all took cooperation and conflict resolution\nto be central ideas in understanding morality. It is unclear, however,\nwhether Curry\u2019s view can adequately distinguish morality from\nlaw and from other systems that aim to reduce conflict by providing\nsolutions to coordination problems.\n\nTurning from anthropology to psychology, one significant topic of\ninvestigation is the existence and nature of a distinction between the\nmoral and the conventional. More specifically, the distinction at\nissue is between (a) acts that are judged wrong only because of a\ncontingent convention or because they go against the dictates of some\nrelevant authority, and (b) those that are judged to be wrong quite\nindependently of these things, that have a seriousness to them, and\nthat are justified by appeal to the notions of harm, rights, or\njustice. Elliot Turiel emphasized this distinction, and drew attention\nto the danger, if one overlooks it, of lumping together moral rules\nwith non-moral \u201cconventions that further the coordination of\nsocial interactions within social systems\u201d (1983:\n109\u2013111). Those who accept this distinction are implicitly\noffering a definition of morality in the descriptive sense. Not\neveryone does accept the distinction, however. Edouard Machery and Ron\nMallon (2010) for example, are suspicious of the idea that\nauthority-independence, universality, justification by appeal to harm,\njustice, or rights, and seriousness form a cluster found together with\nsufficient regularity to be used to set moral norms apart from other\nnorms. Kelly et al. (2007) are similarly skeptical, and bring\nempirical evidence to bear on the question.\n\nThe psychologist Kurt Gray might be seen as offering an account of\nmoral judgment that would allow us to determine the morality of an\nindividual or group. He and his co-authors suggest that \n\n\nmorality is essentially represented by a cognitive template that\ncombines a perceived intentional agent with a perceived suffering\npatient. (Gray, Young, & Waytz 2012: 102) \n\n\nThis claim, while quite strong, is nevertheless not as implausibly\nstrong as it might seem, since the thesis is directly concerned with\nthe template we use when thinking about moral matters; it is\nnot directly concerned with the nature of morality itself. In the\nsense of \u201ctemplate\u201d at issue here, the template we use\nwhen thinking about dogs might include having four legs, a tail, and\nfur, among other things. But that does not mean that an animal must\nhave these features to count as a dog, or even that we believe\nthis.\n\nGiven the way that Gray et al. think of templates, even if their\nhypothesis is correct, it would not mean that our psychology requires\nus to think of the moral as always involving intentional agents and\nperceiving patients. In line with this, and despite some lapses in\nwhich they suggest that \u201cmoral acts can be defined in\nterms of intention and suffering\u201d, (2012: 109) their considered\nview seems to be only that the dyadic template fits the\nmajority of moral situations, as we conceive them. Moreover,\nthe link between immoral behavior and suffering to which they appeal\nin defending their general view is sometimes so indirect as to\nundermine its significance. For example, they fit authority violations\ninto their suffering-based template by noting that \u201cauthority\nstructures provide a way of peacefully resolving conflict\u201d and\nthat \u201cviolence results when social structures are\nthreatened\u201d. In a similar stretch, they account for judgments\nthat promiscuity is wrong by gesturing at the suffering involved in\nsexually transmitted diseases (2012: 107).\n\nAnother position in cognitive psychology that has relevance for the\ndefinition of morality in the descriptive sense takes moral judgment\nto be a natural kind: the product of an innate moral grammar (Mikhail\n2007). If moral judgment is a natural kind in this way, then a\nperson\u2019s moral code might simply consist in the moral judgments\nthat person is disposed to make. One piece of evidence that there is\nsuch a grammar is to be found in the relative universality of certain\nmoral concepts in human cultures: concepts such as obligation,\npermission, and prohibition. Another is an argument similar to\nChomsky\u2019s famous \u201cpoverty of the stimulus\u201d argument\nfor a universal human grammar (Dwyer et al. 2010; see also Roedder and\nHarman 2010).\n\nIn evolutionary biology, morality is sometimes simply equated with\nfairness (Baumard et al. 2013: 60, 77) or reciprocal altruism\n(Alexander 1987: 77). But it is also sometimes identified by reference\nto an evolved capacity to make a certain sort of judgment and perhaps\nalso to signal that one has made it (Hauser 2006). This also makes\nmorality into something very much like a natural kind, that can be\nidentified by reference to causal/historical processes. In that case,\na content-based definition of morality isn\u2019t required: certain\ncentral features are all that one needs to begin one\u2019s\ntheorizing, since they will be enough to draw attention to certain\npsychologically and biologically individuated mechanisms, and the\nstudy of morality will be a detailed inquiry into the nature and\nevolutionary history of these mechanisms.\n",
