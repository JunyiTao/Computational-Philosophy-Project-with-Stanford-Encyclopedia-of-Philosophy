    "main_text": "Physics || Psychology\n3.1 Psychology\n\nSuhrawardi revisits Avicenna\u2019s psychology, the framework out of\nwhich he elaborates his original ishraqi psychology. While he\nfinds inadequate the Peripatetic proofs for the immortality of the\nsoul (PI, \u00a7\u00a791\u20133),the soul remains an\nimmaterial, self-subsisting, living, knowing substance, capable of\nruling over the body. However, he defines its substance in terms of\nthe intensity of its individual luminosity. Thereupon, a relation of\ndominion (qahr) and love (mahabba) or desire\n(\u2018ishq) is established between the luminous substance\nof the soul and the tenebrous substance of the body (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7147\u20138). Between the two, the subtle substance of the\n(psychic) pneuma (ruh) functions as an intermediary\nthat enables the reception of images, forms or \u2018icons\u2019 of\nmetaphysical realities that it then reflects and manifests onto the\nsoul (PI, \u00a7\u00a7216\u20137). \n\nVision remains the most important sense. It rests at the heart of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi theory of vision that provides,\nonce redefined, a mode of apprehension upon which can be modelled his\ntheory of knowledge by presence. He criticizes and rejects the\nmaterialist implications of the imprinting of forms in the material\nsubstratum of the eye implied in the prevalent\n\u2018extramissive\u2019 and \u2018intromissive\u2019 theories of\nvision. Although mediated by a physical organ, vision remains instead\nprimarily an activity of the human (light) soul, whereby the soul\naccesses directly the reality of the objects of vision (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7101\u20134). In the Philosophy of Illumination,\nthe vision of physical objects requires, first, a\n\u2018presential\u2019 face-to-face encounter of that which\nperceives, both the physical organ and the human soul, and the\nilluminated object; second, the absence of obstacles between subject\nand object, often described in mystical terms as the absence of veils,\nwhereby the soul becomes illuminated by the (substantial or\naccidental) light of the object; and, finally, the presence of light,\nthe necessary condition for the establishment of this ishraqi\nrelation. Vision thus unfolds simultaneously on two different planes,\nphysical visual perception being reduced to the soul\u2019s\nperception or awareness of the intrinsic and essential light possessed\nby the object, with which it shares a light reality. Therefore, true\nvision does not require the acquisition and transmission of forms, but\noccurs through the soul\u2019s ability to be aware of the essential\nlight-reality of the object. Hence, physics and metaphysics merge, as\nvisible objects have the ability to receive and emit light, though\nonly in an accidental manner, light being precisely what the managing\n(mudabbira) light-soul, the Isfahbad-light, is able to\nperceive, whether it be through the senses, the soul/intellect,\nintuition, or dreams (PI, \u00a7\u00a7145\u20136). A certain\ntype of intuitive (innate) knowledge of the light rests at the heart\nof vision (PI, \u00a7226) and upon which discursive knowledge\nmay subsequently validate rationally through demonstrations\n(Ha\u2019iri Yazdi 1992; Dinani 1985). \n\nSuhrawardi also criticizes the localization of the internal faculties\nin different parts of the brain, since localizing them in a material\norgan again naturalizes the process of representation. Internal\nfaculties now become shadows (or functions) of the soul, lumped\ntogether into a single faculty responsible for representation. The\nIsfahbad-light principle accesses the dominating (qahira)\nlights, rules over the active imagination, and reflects onto it the\nlights it receives and grasps. The faculty of representation perceives\nparticulars, while the governing (mudabbira) light, the\nIsfahbad-light principle that guarantees the unity of the soul, can\nperceive universals and immaterial entities. The emphasis on the\nwholeness of the soul, as the main perceiving entity, and the\nreduction of the Avicennan faculties traditionally responsible for\nrepresentation to a single faculty could find their origin in Abu\nal-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s al-Mu\u2018tabar (1939, vol.\n2, 318\u201324; cf. Pines 1979, 227\u201331). As for recollection,\nSuhrawardi defines it in a rather Platonic manner, whereby it becomes\nthe retrieval of images (or concepts) whose existence lies in the\n\u2018world of memorial\u2019, accessible only to the luminous part\nof the soul, though not in the manner of the Platonic theory of\nknowledge by recollection of the soul\u2019s prior knowledge it\npossessed before its temporal origination with its body. \n\nFor Suhrawardi, illumination becomes a metaphor for the intellective\nprocess. Illuminative relations take place between metaphysical active\nlight principles and the human soul (Marcotte forthcoming). Whereas\nonly the (rational) Isfahbad-light part of the soul is immortal,\nSuhrawardi, nevertheless, notes the possibility for the imaginative\nfaculty of souls that have not yet achieved perfection to\n\u201cescape to the world of suspended images, whose locus is one of\nthe celestial barriers\u201d that would function as an\n\u2018astral\u2019 body, bringing \u201cimages into being\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7\u00a7244\u20136). While perfect souls have\ndirect access to the (intelligible) immaterial lights (PI,\n\u00a7250), the survival of human imagination would be required for\nthe experiencing of divine retribution and the perfecting of imperfect\nsouls in the afterlife. \n\nThe spheres of Ether and Zamharir, both situated below the sphere of\nthe Moon and associated with the world of elements, are identified as\npossible spiritual/\u2018pneumatic\u2019 substrata for the\nposthumous activities of the imaginative faculties of those souls\n(Suh. 1993c, 245); although, it has been suggested that it could\n\u201csimply be read as one of the celestial bodies, Moon, Mercury,\nVenus, and so on\u201d (van Lit 2017, 47). Suhrawardi postulates the\nexistence of this independent eschatological realm with the assistance\nof which sensitive perceptions can occur in the form of imaginable\nrepresentations (PI, \u00a7244\u20138; Suh. 1992a, 90;\nMarcotte 2011; cf. Kutubi 2015, 93\u20136). Suhrawardi\u2019s\n\u2018world of images\u2019 provides a solution to Avicenna\u2019s\nattempt to explain posthumous felicity of souls in the Hereafter, in\nthe form of posthumous \u2018imaginable\u2019 experience of\npleasures and pains (see section 4.3) and to explain the ethics\neschatology nexus (see section 5). \n\nFinally, while Suhrawardi denies metempsychosis in his Peripatetic\nworks (namely Flashes of Light and Intimations), he\nwould seems more sympathetic to the idea in the Philosophy of\nIllumination. In this work, he reviews arguments for and against\nmetempsychosis that remain inconclusive, such that he does not appear\nto reject completely the possibility of some kind of transmigration of\nsouls (cf. Plotinus\u2019 Enneads), especially for imperfect\n(miserable) souls. However, some commentators, like Shahrazuri, were\nof the opinion that he upheld metempsychosis (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7229\u201345; Schmidtke 1999; Walbridge 2017,\n271\u201373). \n",
