    "main_text": "Retentional Approaches || Motivations\n4.1 Motivations\n\nEndorsing the Augustinian doctrine that consciousness is confined to\nthe present point of time does not oblige one to reject the claim that\nchange and succession feature prominently in immediate experience.\nThese theses are quite compatible with one another provided the\nexperience of change occurs within the confines of the\nmomentary present. Indeed, in the eyes of some\u2014but not\nall\u2014this is a necessary precondition for contents to be\nexperienced together as parts of a unified whole. The obvious way of\ndeveloping an account along these lines is to hold that momentary\nepisodes of sensory consciousness are accompanied by a simultaneously\nexisting array of representations (or retentions) of\nimmediately preceding conscious states, and our awareness\u2014at a\nsingle moment of time\u2014of this combination of ingredients\nprovides us with what we take to be a direct awareness of change and\nsuccession. This \u201cretentional\u201d approach\u2014recalling\nthe terminology of\n \u00a71.1\u2014was\n comparatively commonplace by the end of the nineteenth century and\ncontinues to attract supporters.\n\nMany realists have no doubt found this approach appealing because it\noffers a simple and intuitively satisfying explanation of how an\nexperience of succession differs from a mere succession of\nexperiences: in the former case, the contents forming the succession\nare presented together, as an ensemble, to a single momentary\nawareness. Brentano and Husserl both subscribed to the Principle\nof Simultaneous Awareness (PSA) that we encountered in\n \u00a71.2:\n \u201cIf one is aware of a succession or duration, one is\nnecessarily aware of it at one moment\u201d. Indeed, it may well be\nthat some theorists, consciously or unconsciously, have found the\nretentional approach appealing because of the way it (in effect)\nreduces the problem of diachronic phenomenal unity to the\ncomparatively straightforward problem of synchronic unity.\n",
