    "main_text": "The Issue of Probabilistic Belief || Ellsberg\u2019s Three Colour paradox\n3.1 Ellsberg\u2019s Three Colour paradox\n\nIn another classic challenge to SEU, Ellsberg (1961) asked subjects to\nconsider a setup in which an urn contains 30 red balls and 60 black or\nyellow balls in unknown relative proportions and report their\npreferences between various bets on the colour of a ball drawn at\nrandom from the urn. The preferences elicited were the ones holding\nbetween\\(f_1\\) and \\(g_1\\) below, on the one hand, and \\(f_2\\) and\n\\(g_2\\), on the other:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n \\(\\overbrace{\\phantom{30 balls}}^{\\textrm{30 balls}}\\) \n\n\\(\\overbrace{\\phantom{45630 balls}}^{\\textrm{60 balls}}\\)\n\n\u00a0 \n r \n b \n y \n\n \\(f_1\\) \n $100 \n $0 \n $0 \n\n \\(g_1\\) \n $0 \n $100 \n $0 \n\n \\(f_2\\) \n $100 \n $0 \n $100 \n\n \\(g_2\\) \n $0 \n $100 \n $100\n\n\n\nEllsberg reported that a majority of subjects exhibited the\npreferences \\(f_1\\succ g_1\\), but \\(g_2\\succ f_2\\), an instance of a\nphenomenon that has come to be known as ambiguity aversion: a\nrelative preference for betting on events of known rather than unknown\n(\u201cambiguous\u201d) probability.\n\nIf one grants that the outcomes are adequately characterised in sole\nterms of associated changes in level of wealth, these \u201cEllsberg\npreferences\u201d stand in direct contradiction with Savage\u2019s\nSure-Thing principle. These preferences also violate Machina &\nSchmeidler\u2019s Strong Comparative Probability principle, on the\nnatural assumption that the subjects strictly prefer the outcome\n\\(\\$100\\) to the outcome \\(\\$0\\). And indeed it is easy to see that\nthe Ellsberg preferences are inconsistent with probabilistic\nsophistication. More specifically, they are incompatible with its\nbeing the case that both (i) the decision maker\u2019s preferences\nover acts are reducible to preferences over corresponding lotteries\nover outcomes, generated by an assignment of subjective probabilities\nto the set of events and (ii) he or she partially orders these\nlotteries by first-order stochastic dominance. To see why, assume that\nthese conditions hold. Note first that \\(P_{g_1}\\) would\nstochastically dominate \\(P_{f_1}\\) if and only if \\(P(\\{b\\})\\geq\nP(\\{r\\})\\) and that \\(P_{f_2}\\) would stochastically dominate\n\\(P_{g_2}\\) if and only if \\(P(\\{r\\})\\geq P(\\{b\\})\\). \\(f_1\\succ g_1\\)\nwould entail that \\(P_{g_1}\\) does not stochastically dominate\n\\(P_{f_1}\\), and hence that \\(P(\\{r\\}) > P(\\{b\\})\\). But \\(g_2\\succ\nf_2\\) would entail that \\(P_{f_2}\\) does not stochastically dominate\n\\(P_{g_2}\\), and hence that \\(P(\\{b\\})> P(\\{r\\})\\).\nContradiction.\n\nConsiderable empirical evidence has confirmed Ellsberg\u2019s\ninformal observations and related phenomena (beginning with Becker\n& Brownson 1964 and including classic studies such as Slovic &\nTversky 1974 and MacCrimmon & Larsson 1979; see the classic\nCamerer & Weber 1992, as well as the more up-to-date Trautmann\n& van de Kuilen 2015, for further details) and the literature now\ncontains a substantial number of generalisations of SEU that can\naccommodate these.\n",
