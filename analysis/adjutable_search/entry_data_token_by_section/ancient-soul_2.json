    "main_text": "Plato's Theories of Soul\n3. Plato's Theories of Soul\n\n The various developments that occurred in the sixth and fifth\ncenturies in how Greeks thought and spoke of the soul resulted in a\nvery complex notion that strikes one as remarkably close to\nconceptions of the soul that we find in fourth century philosophical\ntheories, notably Plato's.  There is thus some reason to think that\nthe philosophical theories in question are best interpreted as working\nwith, and on, the relatively non-theoretical notion of the soul that\nby the end of the fifth century has come to be embedded in ordinary\nlanguage. In what follows our main concern will be to characterize\nsome of the theories in question. But we should also attend, wherever\nthis seems appropriate and helpful, to ways in which familiarity with\nthe ordinary notion of the soul might enable us better to understand\nwhy a theory or an argument proceeds the way it does. In addition, we\nshould note ways in which philosophical theories might seem to clarify\nand further articulate the ordinary notion. We begin with Plato, and\nwith a question that is intimately tied up with the ordinary notion of\nthe soul as it developed from the Homeric poems onwards, namely\nwhether a person's soul does indeed survive the person's death.  \n",
