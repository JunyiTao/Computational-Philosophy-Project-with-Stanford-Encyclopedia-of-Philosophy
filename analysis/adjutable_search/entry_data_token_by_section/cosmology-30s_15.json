Robertson\u2019s conclusion exhibits this point\nclearly and explicitly:\n\nWe have examined, from the operational standpoint, the problem of\ndetermining the most general kinematical background suitable for an\nidealized universe in which the cosmological principle holds. Allowing\nthe fundamental observers the use only of clocks and theodolites, and\ngranting them the possibility of sending and receiving we have shown\nthat for each given mode of motion x(t) there necessarily\nexists a quadratic line element which is invariant, in form as well as\nin fact, under transformation from one fundamental observer to\nanother. (Robertson 1935 p. 300)\n\n\nUnlike de Sitter, Robertson accepts the cosmological principle,\nreplete with its observers on far-separated particles. Moreover, as\nthis statement shows, Robertson is intimately familiar with\nMilne\u2019s latest operationalist reduction: space is to be reduced\nto time measurements given by clock readings on signals exchanged\nbetween observers. Robertson gets this idea from Milne\u2019s book,\nwhich he had earlier reviewed (but which was only subsequently\npublished) for Astrophysical Journal (Robertson 1936).\n",
