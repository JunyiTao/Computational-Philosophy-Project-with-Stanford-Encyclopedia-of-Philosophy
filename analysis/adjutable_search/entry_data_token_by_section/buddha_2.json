    "main_text": "Non-Self\n3. Non-Self\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s \u2018middle path\u2019 strategy can be seen as\none of first arguing that since the word \u2018I\u2019 is a mere enumerative\nterm like \u2018pair\u2019, there is nothing that it genuinely\ndenotes; and then explaining that our erroneous sense of an\n\u2018I\u2019 stems from our employment of the useful fiction\nrepresented by the concept of the person. While the second part of\nthis strategy only receives its full articulation in the later\ndevelopment of the theory of two truths, the first part can be found\nin the Buddha\u2019s own teachings, in the form of several\nphilosophical arguments for non-self. Best known among these is the\nargument from impermanence (S III.66\u20138), which has this basic\nstructure:\n\n1.\nIf there were a self it would be permanent.\n2.\nNone of the five kinds of psychophysical element is\npermanent.\n\u2234\nThere is no self.\n\n\nIt is the fact that this argument does not contain a premise\nexplicitly asserting that the five skandhas (classes of\npsychophysical element) are exhaustive of the constituents of persons,\nplus the fact that these are all said to be empirically observable,\nthat leads some to claim that the Buddha did not intend to deny the\nexistence of a self tout court. There is, however, evidence\nthat the Buddha was generally hostile toward attempts to establish the\nexistence of unobservable entities. In the Pohap\u0101da Sutta (D\nI.178\u2013203), for instance, the Buddha compares someone who posits\nan unseen seer in order to explain our introspective awareness of\ncognitions, to a man who has conceived a longing for the most\nbeautiful woman in the world based solely on the thought that such a\nwoman must surely exist. And in the Tevijja Sutta (D I.235\u201352),\nthe Buddha rejects the claim of certain Brahmins to know the path to\noneness with Brahman, on the grounds that no one has actually observed\nthis Brahman. This makes more plausible the assumption that the\nargument has as an implicit premise the claim that there is no more to\nthe person than the five skandhas.\n\nPremise (1) appears to be based on the assumption that persons undergo\nrebirth, together with the thought that one function of a self would\nbe to account for diachronic personal identity. By\n\u2018permanent\u2019 is here meant continued existence over at\nleast several lives. This is shown by the fact that the Buddha rules\nout the body as a self on the grounds that the body exists for just\none lifetime. (This also demonstrates that the Buddha did not mean by\n\u2018impermanent\u2019 what some later Buddhist philosophers meant,\nviz., existing for just a moment; the Buddhist doctrine of\nmomentariness represents a later development.) The mental entities\nthat make up the remaining four types of psychophysical element might\nseem like more promising candidates, but these are ruled out on the\ngrounds that these all originate in dependence on contact between\nsense faculty and object, and last no longer than a particular\nsense-object-contact event. That he listed five kinds of\npsychophysical element, and not just one, shows that the Buddha\nembraced a kind of dualism. But this strategy for demonstrating the\nimpermanence of the psychological elements shows that his dualism was\nnot the sort of mind-body dualism familiar from substance ontologies\nlike those of Descartes and of the Ny\u0101ya school of orthodox\nIndian philosophy. Instead of seeing the mind as the persisting bearer\nof such transient events as occurrences of cognition, feeling and\nvolition, he treats \u2018mind\u2019 as a kind of aggregate term for\nbundles of transient mental events. These events being impermanent,\nthey too fail to account for diachronic personal identity in the way\nin which a self might be expected to.\n\nAnother argument for non-self, which might be called the argument from\ncontrol (S III.66\u20138), has this structure:\n\n1.\nIf there were a self, one could never desire that it be\nchanged.\n2.\nEach of the five kinds of psychophysical element is such that one\ncan desire that it be changed.\n\u2234\nThere is no self.\n\n\nPremise (1) is puzzling. It appears to presuppose that the self should\nhave complete control over itself, so that it would effortlessly\nadjust its state to its desires. That the self should be thought of as\nthe locus of control is certainly plausible. Those Indian\nself-theorists who claim that the self is a mere passive witness\nrecognize that the burden of proof is on them to show that the self is\nnot an agent. But it seems implausibly demanding to require of the\nself that it have complete control over itself. We do not require that\nvision see itself if it is to see other things. The case of vision\nsuggests an alternative interpretation, however. We might hold that\nvision does not see itself for the reason that this would violate an\nirreflexivity principle, to the effect that an entity cannot operate\non itself. Indian philosophers who accept this principle cite\nsupportive instances such as the knife that cannot cut itself and the\nfinger-tip that cannot touch itself. If this principle is accepted,\nthen if the self were the locus of control it would follow that it\ncould never exercise this function on itself. A self that was the\ncontroller could never find itself in the position of seeking to\nchange its state to one that it deemed more desirable. On this\ninterpretation, the first premise seems to be true. And there is ample\nevidence that (2) is true: it is difficult to imagine a bodily or\npsychological state over which one might not wish to exercise control.\nConsequently, given the assumption that the person is wholly composed\nof the psychophysical elements, it appears to follow that a self of\nthis description does not exist.\n\nThese two arguments appear, then, to give good reason to deny a self\nthat might ground diachronic personal identity and serve as locus of\ncontrol, given the assumption that there is no more to the person than\nthe empirically given psychophysical elements. But it now becomes\nsomething of a puzzle how one is to explain diachronic personal\nidentity and agency. To start with the latter, does the argument from\ncontrol not suggest that control must be exercised by something other\nthan the psychophysical elements? This was precisely the conclusion of\nthe S\u0101\u1e43khya school of orthodox Indian philosophy. One of\ntheir arguments for the existence of a self was that it is possible to\nexercise control over all the empirically given constituents of the\nperson; while they agree with the Buddha that a self is never\nobserved, they take the phenomena of agency to be grounds for positing\na self that transcends all possible experience.\n\nThis line of objection to the Buddha\u2019s teaching of non-self is\nmore commonly formulated in response to the argument from\nimpermanence, however. Perhaps its most dramatic form is aimed at the\nBuddha\u2019s acceptance of the doctrines of karma and rebirth. It is\nclear that the body ceases to exist at death. And given the\nBuddha\u2019s argument that mental states all originate in dependence\non sense-object contact events, it seems no psychological constituent\nof the person can transmigrate either. Yet the Buddha claims that\npersons who have not yet achieved enlightenment will be reborn as\nsentient beings of some sort after they die. If there is no\nconstituent whatever that moves from one life to the next, how could\nthe being in the next life be the same person as the being in this\nlife? This question becomes all the more pointed when it is added that\nrebirth is governed by karma, something that functions as a kind of\ncosmic justice: those born into fortunate circumstances do so as a\nresult of good deeds in prior lives, while unpleasant births result\nfrom evil past deeds. Such a system of reward and punishment could be\njust only if the recipient of pleasant or unpleasant karmic fruit is\nthe same person as the agent of the good or evil action. And the\nopponent finds it incomprehensible how this could be so in the absence\nof a persisting self.\n",
