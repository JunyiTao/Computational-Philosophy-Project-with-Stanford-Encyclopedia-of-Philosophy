Platonism\n\nIn the years before the second world war it became clear that weighty\nobjections had been raised against each of the three anti-platonist\nprograms in the philosophy of mathematics. Predicativism was perhaps\nan exception, but it was at the time a program without defenders. Thus\nroom was created for a renewed interest in the prospects of\nplatonistic views about the nature of mathematics. On the platonistic\nconception, the subject matter of mathematics consists of abstract\nentities.\n",
