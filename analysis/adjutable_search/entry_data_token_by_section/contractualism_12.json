In particular, discussion of the ethics of harm focuses on\ncases where each action will definitely harm some particular person.\nBut real-life ethics invariably involves widespread uncertainty. Most\nactual \u201charmful\u201d activities are socially productive ones\nthat impose some risk of harm on others. (Fried 2012a, 2012b) Can\nContractualists provide a plausible and distinctive account of when\nand why such activities are permitted? (For more detailed discussion\nof a variety of Contractualist accounts of risk, see Frick 2015, Fried\n2012a, Horton 2017, Kumar 2015.)\n\nWe begin with a simple example:\n\nDriving: Bob lives in a large city in the developed world.\nHis daily life is greatly enhanced by the fact that he and others are\nable to drive cars. Bob drives to work, drives out of town for the\nweekend, drives to the local shopping mall, enjoys goods and services\nthat are only available because others can drive, and so on. One\nmorning, while walking his dog along the street, Bob is killed in a\ntraffic accident. The driver was not at fault \u2013 she was not\nspeeding or drunk or otherwise irresponsible. Bob is just unlucky. In\na large city where millions of people drive every day, faultless fatal\naccidents like this are bound to happen from time to time.\n\nOver the course of his life, Bob received many benefits from his and\nothers\u2019 driving. But suppose these are outweighed by the cost of\nhis untimely death. As things turned out, Bob would have been\nbetter-off if driving had not been permitted. This seems to give Bob a\nreason to reject any principle that permits driving. And this reason\nseems to outweigh other people\u2019s reasons to want driving to be\npermitted. (After all, any inconvenience they suffered would not be as\nbad as an early death.) It therefore seems that contractualism cannot\npermit driving. Indeed, contractualism must prohibit all\nsocially useful activities that carry any risk of harm\n\u2013 on the grounds that, in a large population, over the course of\na lifetime, any such activity is virtually certain to lead to at least\none death.\n\nUtilitarians have an easy solution. Driving should be permitted if it\nmaximises expected aggregate welfare. A small risk of death is\noutweighed by a large number of individual benefits. If Contractualism\ncannot permit any risky activities, then this places it at a distinct\ndisadvantage against utilitarianism.\n\nOne simple solution is to restrict the scope of contractualism. If\ncontractualism deals only with cases where harm is certain, then it\nneed not address risk at all. We could then combine a contractualist\naccount of certain harm with a utilitarian account of risks of harm.\nUnfortunately, this solution has a high cost. Given the ubiquity of\nrisk, and the comparative rarity of cases of certain harm, this\npluralist option effectively sidelines contractualism.\n\nA second simple solution is to bite the bullet, and insist that risky\nsocial activities are never permitted. Few contractualists embrace\nthis extreme revisionism. And it too threatens irrelevance. People\nwill never abandon risk altogether, and we naturally turn to ethical\ntheory to guide us through our risky activities. If contractualism is\nsilent in this crucial area, then it loses any claim to be of\npractical relevance.\n\nThe challenge for contractualism is to steer a middle-way between\nbanning risk altogether and collapsing into utilitarianism.\n\nOne central question is whether our contractualist evaluation of risk\nshould be ex post or ex ante. Contractualism tells us to justify our\nmoral principles to each person. A principle permitting driving must\nbe justified to Bob. But when do we imagine this justification\noccurring? Suppose we were to offer Bob a choice between two\nprinciples: one permits driving and the other forbids it. When does\nBob make this choice? Does he choose in advance \u2013 perhaps before\nhe moves to the city or before his life begins? Or does he choose in\nretrospect \u2013 after he knows how his life has actually gone?\n\nIn cases involving risk and uncertainty, these two temporal\nperspectives represent very different epistemological standpoints. Ex\nante, Bob knows that living in a city where driving is permitted\nexposes him to a very small risk of death in a car accident where no\none is at fault. Ex post, Bob knows that living in a city where\ndriving is permitted has in fact resulted in his death.\n\nSome forms of contractualism explicitly favour ex ante rather than ex\npost evaluation. Rawls, for instance, asks his parties to choose\nprinciples to govern their society on the basis of general knowledge\nabout how their lives might go, rather than particular information\nabout their specific circumstances. Scanlonian contractualism, by\ncontrast, usually requires justification to actual people who are\naware of their own situation. In his 1998 book, Scanlon explicitly\nfavours ex post justification. However, most contractualists\n(including Scanlon himself) now favour either ex ante contractualism\nor some hybrid view combining both ex ante and ex post evaluations.\n(Scanlon 2013, Kumar 2015, Frick 2015.)\n\nIn our original Driving case, ex ante justification seems to delivers\nthe intuitively correct result. When he views the prospects in\nadvance, Bob may well conclude that the very small risk of death is\noutweighed \u2013 from his own perspective \u2013 by the large\nnumber of benefits he is almost certain to enjoy. If the imbalance is\nsufficiently great, we might conclude that it would not be reasonable\nfor Bob to reject a principle that permits driving. (Some extremely\nrisk-averse individuals will perhaps still object to driving, but\ncontractualists can reply that this rejection is not reasonable.)\n\nUnfortunately, there are two problems with this contractualist\nresponse. First, if all citizens face the same pattern of risks and\nbenefits, then this ex ante justification threatens to collapse into\nutilitarianism in practice. Contractualism thus risks losing its\ndistinctiveness. Second, if citizens face different risk profiles,\nthen even ex ante contractualism may still find itself unable to\njustify any risky behaviour. Consider a new example:\n\nFlying: Commercial air travel brings many benefits to many\npeople. However, it also brings small risks of death. Some of this\nrisk falls on people who benefit from air travel \u2013 notably\npassengers. But some people exposed to the same risks enjoy no\nbenefits. Jeb is an Amish farmer who completely eschews all the\n\u2018benefits\u2019 of modern life. Jeb lives under the flightpath\nof air traffic between two major cities. (Jeb was not consulted about\nthis flightpath.) One day, debris from a passing airplane falls on Jeb\nand kills him. (This example is adapted from Kumar 2015, which draws\non Ashford 2003.)\n\nJeb obviously has a strong ex post complaint against any principle\npermitting flying. But he also has an ex ante complaint. Even before\nhe knows that he will be killed by falling debris, Jeb expects no\nbenefit whatsoever from flying. (Indeed, he does not regard flying as\ntruly beneficial to anyone!) Jeb will want to reject in advance any\nprinciple that imposes on him a risk of death without any compensating\nbenefits. From a contractualist perspective, this rejection seems\nreasonable.\n\nThe two challenges for ex ante contractualists are (a) to offer a\nprincipled justification for rejecting Jeb\u2019s complaint; and (b)\nto ensure that that justification does not collapse into\nutilitarianism. One possibility is to argue that, like Curious, Jeb is\ntoo eccentric for contractualist purposes. We should be asking what\npeople in general have reason to reject, rather than examining the\nstrange predilections of singular individuals. However, unlike\nCurious\u2019s counter-suggestible risk-seeking, Jeb\u2019s\nrejection of modern life is considered and (prima facie) reasonable.\nIf contractualism rejects Jeb\u2019s considered worldview as\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d, then he might object that contractualism\nthereby fails to treat him with the respect due to a rational\nagent.\n\nA better alternative for the contractualist is to focus on broader\nprinciples that apply to all risky activities, rather than artificial\nprinciples relating only to flying. Jeb gains no benefit from air\ntravel. But he, along with everyone else, does benefit from living in\na society where everyone is free to pursue their own goals according\nto their own values. Jeb thus has reason to reject any principle that\nprevents people in general from pursuing reasonable lifestyle options,\neven if some of those options impose small risks of death on\nothers.\n\nAnother problem for ex ante contractualism is that, in some other\npossible cases, it is ex post evaluation that seems most appropriate.\nContrast two scenarios introduced by Frances Kamm (Kamm 2007, p. 273;\nFried 2012a, p. 47):\n\nAmbulance I: Should our city authorize its ambulances to\nspeed on the way to the hospital whenever it is the case that doing so\nwill save five sick passengers for every one pedestrian who is killed\nas a result of the speeding?\n\nAmbulance II: Should our city also prohibit its ambulance\ndrivers from braking to save an identifiable pedestrian\u2019s life\nwhenever it is the case that the time lost by braking will cause the\nfive passengers inside the ambulance to die?\n\nMany people judge that the first policy is permissible while the\nsecond is not. (Kamm 2007, Lenman 2008) This leads some\ncontractualists to favour hybrid view that combine ex post and ex ante\nevaluation. (e.g., Lenman 2008) It is one thing to ask everyone to\nagree in advance to a policy that will predictably result in the\ndeaths of some pedestrians, but another thing altogether to ask\nthis particular pedestrian to lay down her life for the\ngreater good!\n\nUnfortunately, critics of contractualism allege that hybrid views\nproduce implausible results of their own in cases where the parties\nhave asymmetric information about their fate. (Fried 2012a, pp.\n53\u201354) Consider a final case introduced by Sophia Reibetanz\n(Reibetanz 1998):\n\nUnexploded Mines: One hundred workers are working in a field\nknown to contain an unexploded mine. Another person, Z, is the only\none who could disarm the mine. If Z disarms the mine, then Z is\ncertain to get pneumonia. If Z doesn\u2019t disarm the mine, then it\nis certain that 1 of the 100 workers will be seriously injured. This\nserious injury is ten times worse than suffering pneumonia.\n\nZ faces a certainty of (minor) harm, while each worker faces a 1%\nchance of (greater) harm. If Z is allowed to appeal to this\ninformation asymmetry, then Z\u2019s complaint trumps the complaint\nof any individual worker. Z can thus reasonably reject any principle\nthat requires Z to disarm the mine. But this seems counter-intuitive,\nas the certain result is a much greater harm for someone else. The\nchallenge for hybrid contractualists is either to avoid this result or\nto explain why it is justified. (Ostuka 2011, Reibetanz 1998. For an\nargument that contractualism cannot solve this problem, see Fried\n2012a, p. 54)\n",
