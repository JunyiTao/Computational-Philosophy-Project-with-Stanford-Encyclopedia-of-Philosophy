(Freedman 1998), is the\nTopological Quantum Field Theory model. In contrast to the easily\nvisualisable circuit model, this model resides in the most abstract\nreaches of theoretical physics. The exotic physical systems TQFT\ndescribes are topological states of matter. That the formalism of TQFT\ncan be applied to computational problems was shown by Witten (1989)\nand the idea was later developed by others. The model has been proved\nto be efficiently simulatable on a standard quantum computer\n(Freedman, Kitaev, and Wang 2002; Aharonov, Jones, and Landau 2009).\nIts main merit lies in its high tolerance to the errors which are\ninevitably introduced in the implementation of a large scale quantum\ncomputer (see below). Topology is especially helpful here because many\nglobal topological properties are, by definition, invariant under\ndeformation, and given that most errors are local, information encoded\nin topological properties is robust against them.\n4 Realisations\n\nThe quantum computer might be the theoretician\u2019s dream, but as\nfar as experimentalists are concerned, its realisation is a nightmare.\nThe problem is that while some prototypes of the simplest elements\nneeded to build a quantum computer have already been implemented in\nthe laboratory, it is still an open question how to combine these\nelements into scalable systems (see Van Meter and Horsman 2013).\nShor\u2019s algorithm may break RSA encryption, but it will remain an\nanecdote if the largest number that it can factor is 15. In the\ncircuit-based model the problem is to achieve a scalable quantum\nsystem that at the same time will allow one to (1) robustly represent\nquantum information with (2) a time to decoherence significantly\nlonger than the length of the computation, (3) implement a universal\nfamily of unitary transformations, (4) prepare a fiducial initial\nstate, and (5) measure the output result (these are DiVincenzo\n(2000)\u2019s five criteria). Alternative paradigms may trade some of\nthese requirements with others, but the gist will remain the same,\ni.e., one would have to achieve control of one\u2019s quantum system\nin such a way that the system will remain \u201cquantum\u201d albeit\nmacroscopic or at least mesoscopic in its dimensions.\n\nIn order to deal with these challenges, several ingenious solutions\nhave been devised, including quantum error correction codes and fault\ntolerant computation (Shor 1995; Shor and DiVincenzo 1996; Aharonov\nand Ben-Or 1997; Raussendorf, Harrington, and Goyal 2008; Horsman et\nal. 2012; De Beaudrap and Horsman 2019) which can dramatically reduce\nthe spread of errors during a \u2018noisy\u2019 quantum computation.\nAn important criticism of these active error correction schemes,\nhowever, is that they are devised for a very unrealistic noise model\nwhich treats the computer as quantum and the environment as classical\n(Alicki, Lidar, and Zinardi 2006). Once a more realistic noise model\nis allowed, the feasibility of large scale, fault tolerant and\ncomputationally superior quantum computers is less clear (Hagar 2009;\nTabakin 2017).\n\nIn the near term, a promising avenue for realising a quantum advantage\nin a limited number of problem domains is the Noisy Intermediate-Scale\nQuantum (NISQ) paradigm (Preskill 2018). The NISQ paradigm does not\nemploy any error correction mechanisms (postponing the problem to\nimplement scalable versions of these to the future) but rather focuses\non building computational components, and on tackling computational\nproblems, which are inherently more resilient to noise. These include,\nfor example, certain classes of optimisation problems, quantum\nsemidefinite programming, and digital quantum simulation (Tacchino et\nal. 2019). A caveat here is that as the resiliency to noise of a\ncircuit increases, the more classically it behaves. Nevertheless,\nresearch into NISQ computing is believed to be on track to realise a\n50\u2013100 qubit machine\u2014large enough to achieve a quantum advantage\nover known classical alternatives for the envisioned\napplications\u2014within the next 5\u201310 years.\n\nAs mentioned, one of the envisioned applications of NISQ computing is\nfor digital quantum simulation (i.e. simulation using a gate-based\nprogrammable quantum computer). There is an older tradition of\nanalog quantum simulation, however, wherein one utilises a\nquantum system whose dynamics resemble the dynamics of a particular\ntarget system of interest. Although it is believed that digital\nquantum simulation will eventually supersede it, the field of analog\nquantum simulation has progressed substantially in the years since it\nwas first proposed, and analog quantum simulators have already been\nused to study quantum dynamics in regimes thought to be beyond the\nreach of classical simulators (see, e.g., Bernien et al. (2017); for\nfurther discussion of the philosophical issues involved, see\nHangleiter, Carolan, and Th\u00e9bault (2017)).\n",
