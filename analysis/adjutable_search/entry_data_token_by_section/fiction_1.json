    "main_text": "The Nature of Fiction || Semantic and Linguistic Accounts\n1.1 Semantic and Linguistic Accounts\n\nBut what might such a distinction look like? What makes a\nrepresentation like a written text a work of fiction?\nDictionaries often contrast fiction with fact or reality, so one\ntempting thought is that something is a fiction just if it is false,\nor contains falsehoods: a purely semantic characterization of\n\u201cfiction\u201d. This seems to have been Nelson Goodman\u2019s\nview: \u201cLiteral falsity distinguishes fiction from true\nreport\u201d (Goodman 1978: 124). As a number of authors have pointed\nout, however,\nbeing false may be one meaning of the word\n\u201cfiction\u201d, but it is not the only meaning, and it is not\nthe meaning at play when we nowadays call something a work of fiction\n(Lamarque and Olsen 1994; Cohn 1999). If it were, then any work that\ncontains mistakes, say a physics text book, would count as a work of\nfiction.\n\n(This is not to say that there is no connection between these two\nmeanings of \u201cfiction\u201d. Works of fiction typically contain\nnumerous falsehoods, and some have even speculated that the negative\nmeaning of fiction as falsehood may have \u201cdelayed the lexical\nmove of calling novels \u2018fiction\u2019 to a time when this genre\nhad become a well-established, highly respected literary form\u201d\n[Cohn 1999: 3].)\n\nEven if fiction in the intended sense can\u2019t be defined in terms\nof the notion of falsity alone, it might be thought that more\ncomplicated semantic accounts will have a greater chance of success.\nThus, Cohn herself thought that fiction in the intended sense was\n\u201ca literary nonreferential narrative\u201d (1999: 17), where\nbeing \u201cnonreferential\u201d means that the work need\nnot, and does not exclusively, refer to the real world\noutside the text, and that any references when it does \u201care not\nbound to accuracy\u201d (1999: 15). \n\nBut such an account inherits one problem that also affects the simpler\nview of fiction as falsehood. Not only is nonreferentiality, like\nfalsity, not sufficient for a text to be a work of fiction (consider a\nhistory of science text that contains a description of a failed\nscientific theory like phlogiston theory); it is also\nnot necessary. Works of fiction may be wholly true, and in\nthat sense refer exclusively to the real world outside the text. Imagine\na work of historical fiction written about real persons, where,\nunbeknownst to the author, the parts that the author thought she was\nmaking up capture exactly what really happened. That wouldn\u2019t\nmake the work a work of non-fiction (Currie 1990: 9). In addition, the\nidea that references to the real world outside the text are not bound\nto accuracy surely needs to be weakened. Historical novels depend on\ntheir being more or less right about a large part of their historical\nsetting. \n\nProblems such as these have made semantic accounts of fiction\nrelatively unpopular with philosophers. The same is true of approaches\nthat look for textual differences between works of fiction and\nnon-fiction. There seems to be no feature of style or syntax that\nmarks off a work as fictional rather than non-fictional. For any\nproposed feature, say the use of footnotes or indices in works of\nnon-fiction or the use of the imperfect tense in fiction (cf. Recanati\n2000), one can find works from the other category that simply mimic\nthe feature. Certain literary scholars and linguists have suggested an\nexception should be made for free indirect discourse, a literary\ndevice whereby a character\u2019s first-person take on events is\npresented via third-person narration (as in this line from\nEmma by Jane Austen, a master of this literary device:\n\u201cHe was afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid\npoor Isabella would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the\ncarriage behind\u201d [Austen 1815 [1841: 114]). These theorists\nthink free indirect discourse is peculiar to fiction (see especially\nBanfield 1982). But there is substantial evidence to show that other\nwriting may also display this feature (see Fludernik 1993); even\nHemingway used it in his early journalistic writings (Blinova 2012),\nand it is prominent in works of New Journalism, such as Truman\nCapote\u2019s In Cold Blood (1966). At best, the appearance\nof free indirect discourse suggests that the work is a work\nof fiction; it doesn\u2019t imply it (Friend 2012). And the use of\nfree indirect discourse is scarcely necessary for being a\nwork of fiction. Many works show no sign of it.\n",
