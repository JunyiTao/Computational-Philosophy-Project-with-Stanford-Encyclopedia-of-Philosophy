    "main_text": "The Classical Legacy\n1. The Classical Legacy\n\nFrench thinkers considered their country as the heir to the Greek and\nRoman empires. Whether they strictly followed ancient models or not,\nthey saw their work as a continuation of the classical tradition.\nAristotle, Horace, and Plutarch, to name just a few writers, were\nmajor influences on the literature of seventeenth and eighteenth\ncentury France. This self-image of the French explains not only their\ndiscomfort with artistic innovation, but also their disparagement of\nother European countries, their anxieties about what to include in\ntheir national literary canon, and their efforts to impose a\nmasculine, patriotic aesthetic on the painting of the era.\n\nThis loyalty to the Greco-Roman tradition came into conflict with some\nnew ideas in the mid-seventeenth century during the Quarrel of the\nAncients and the Moderns. The quarrel had several phases that focused\non different problems and it spanned approximately seven decades. The\nearliest phase began in the 1650s when a handful of authors attempted\nto renew the genre of epic poetry, since everyone acknowledged that\nthe French had never created their own equivalent to the\nAeneid, as the Italians had done (Tasso\u2019s Jerusalem\nDelivered, 1581) and as the English would soon do (Milton\u2019s\nParadise Lost, 1667). To name just two examples, Desmarets de\nSaint-Sorlin and Jean Chapelain wrote poems following epic conventions\nbut with Christian subjects: the conversion of the first French king\nClovis and the story of Joan of Arc, respectively. These poems were\npublicly mocked by partisans of the Ancient camp, most notably by\nNicolas Boileau, a poet with powerful support at court. Whether these\nChristian epics failed because of their literary qualities or because\nBoileau\u2019s satires were so successful in swaying public opinion,\nthey have now been largely forgotten.\n\nAfter these attempts at modernizing the epic, the next phase of the\nQuarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns focused on other aspects of\nmodern life. This time, Boileau faced a new opponent, Charles\nPerrault, now best known as a compiler of fairy tales. In fact, fairy\ntales were significant because they celebrated the European oral\ntradition that did not have Greco-Roman roots, in contrast to the\nfables of La Fontaine, who was a partisan of the Ancients. Perrault\ntook a stand for the Modern side by writing Parallel of the\nAncients and the Moderns (1688\u201397), a series of dialogues\nbetween three interlocutors: an abbot who represents the Modern camp,\na pr\u00e9sident or high-level administrator who represents\nthe Ancient camp, and a cavalier who tries to reconcile the two points\nof view. At stake was the view of human history as one of degeneration\nor of progress: the Ancients beheld Antiquity as the Golden Age, so\nsubsequent history could only represent a deterioration\u2014in the\narts, in morals, and in other aspects of life. The Moderns saw new\ninventions and scientific discoveries as signs of an upward trend.\nEven in terms of manners, the Moderns claimed that the newly developed\nFrench courtly politeness was an improvement on the rough, though\nheroic, behavior of the Ancient Romans and Greeks. For example, in\nPerrault\u2019s dialogue, the Modern partisan objects to the mention\nin the Iliad that Zeus could beat his wife Hera, whereas that\nbehavior was considered taboo among the upper classes of Ancien\nR\u00e9gime France. The abbot even compares Zeus\u2019 behavior to\nthat of a French peasant. This contrast between ancient Greek and\nEarly Modern French codes of conduct would reappear in the next phase\nof the Quarrel.\n\nThe final phase of the Quarrel, in the 1710s, mainly centered on how\nHomer\u2019s Iliad should be translated. The two most\nprominent players were Anne Dacier and the abb\u00e9 Houdar de la\nMotte. Dacier, a distinguished Hellenic scholar, produced her prose\ntranslation of the Iliad in 1711; based on this work, Houdar,\nwho knew little Greek, published a radically shortened poetic version\nin 1714. In his preface, Houdar represented the Modern camp by daring\nto criticize Homer, and in the main text, he not only cut out parts of\nthe Iliad that he considered too repetitive or long-winded,\nsuch as the description of Achilles\u2019s shield, but he also\nremoved the sections in which the manners of the Ancients appeared too\nuncouth for his taste. In contrast, Anne Dacier advocated for a more\nfaithful translation and showed less regard for the French sense of\npoliteness. She struck against the Moderns in her polemic On the\nCorruption of Taste (1714), deploring the effeminate morals and\nliterature of her contemporaries, in contrast to the heroic ones of\nAntiquity.\n\nIn all phases of the quarrel, all parties agreed that Antiquity should\nbe admired and at no time was the Greco-Roman canon put into question.\nAncient literature was the core of boys\u2019 education in Ancien\nR\u00e9gime France and it remained the standard for French\nintellectuals until the end of the eighteenth century, in spite of\npopular new developments in the novel and theater. After the Quarrel\nof the Ancients and the Moderns, Enlightenment writers reconciled both\nsides by recognizing scientific innovations and improvements in\nlifestyle without losing their desire to imitate ancient literary\nforms or admire the grandeur of ancient heroes.\n\nThis long quarrel had largely concerned whether writers had properly\napplied literary rules. This ancient method for evaluating literature,\nwhich we can observe as early as in Aristotle\u2019s\nPoetics, aimed to determine whether literary works correctly\nfollowed the conventions of, say, genre, diction, or the decorum that\nwas based on characters\u2019 social category. While some French\nthinkers were still approaching literature this way, others were\ndeveloping new ways of judging beauty\u2014artistic and\notherwise\u2014at the cognitive level. The sides they took in debates\nnot only reflected the way they reasoned, but their social milieu and\ntheir institutional status.\n",
