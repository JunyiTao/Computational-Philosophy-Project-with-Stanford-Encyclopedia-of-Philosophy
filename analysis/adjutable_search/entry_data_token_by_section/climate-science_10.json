    "main_text": "Climate Modeling || Evaluating Climate Models\n4.4 Evaluating Climate Models\n\nEvaluation of climate models occurs throughout the model development\nprocess. Parameterizations and component models are often tested\nindividually \u201coff-line\u201d to see how they perform (Randall\net al. 2007), and adjustments are made to try to improve them when\nthey fall short of expectations. Likewise, there is testing and\nadjustment as the different model components are coupled. This\nevaluation can have both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. For\ninstance, it might be checked that the model\u2019s climate is\nbasically realistic-looking, with salient features (e.g., of the\natmospheric circulation) in roughly the right place. Quantitative\nevaluation produces scores on performance metrics. These can\ninclude measures of conservation and stability\u2014how close does\nthe model come to achieving a top-of-atmosphere energy\nbalance?\u2014as well measures of fit between model output and\nobservational data. The evaluation that occurs in the course of model\ndevelopment, however, is rarely reported in publications. What is\nreported instead are features of the model, including how it performs,\nonce it is fully constructed, tuned and ready to be released for\nscientific use.\n\nClimate model evaluation can have many different goals. A basic\nmotivation is simply to learn about how climate models relate to the\nclimate system. Borrowing the language of Giere (2004), we might say\nthat a goal is to learn about the respects in which and degrees to\nwhich climate models are similar to the climate system (Lloyd\n2010). A climate scientist might investigate, for example, whether a\nparticular GCM exhibits a seasonal cycle in temperature for North\nAmerica that roughly matches that which currently occurs in the real\nsystem. Evaluation efforts can also be directed at understanding\nsimilarities at the level of the processes and mechanisms underlying\nbehaviors. In this regard, Lloyd (2009, 2010, 2015) points to fit\nbetween model results and observations on a variety of metrics,\nindependent support for model components, and robustness of findings\nas considerations that are relevant. A second common goal of climate\nmodel evaluation, closely related to the first, is to learn whether a\nmodel is adequate for particular purposes (Parker 2009; Baumberger et al. 2017). As discussed in\n Section 4.3,\n scientists use climate models for various purposes: to characterize\nclimate system properties (e.g., internal variability), to make\nprojections of future climate change under particular scenarios, and\nso on. Many evaluation activities are intended to inform conclusions\nabout climate models\u2019 adequacy for these purposes\nand, ipso facto, about the levels of confidence that can be had in the\nmodels\u2019 estimates of internal variability, their projections of\nfuture climate change, etc.\n\nWhat is known about the ingredients of a climate model\u2014e.g.,\nthat they closely approximate accepted theory or involve massive\nsimplifications\u2014can provide reasons to think that the model is\nsimilar (or not) to the climate system in particular ways or adequate\n(or not) for particular purposes (Baumberger et al. 2017). But climate scientists also seek\nevidence regarding similarity and adequacy by comparing model results\nto observations (see also Guillemot 2010). Such comparisons can be\nqualitative or quantitative, as noted above. In some cases, it is\nrelatively straightforward to gauge whether model-data comparisons\nprovide evidence for or against hypotheses about model-system\nsimilarities or about the adequacy of climate models for\nparticular purposes. Prime candidates include cases in which what is\nhypothesized entails just a rough fit between model results and\nwell-observed climate system behaviors. Thus, for example, the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is able to report\n\n\n\nvery high confidence that models reproduce the general features of the\nglobal-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the\nhistorical period, including the more rapid warming in the second half\nof the 20th century, and the cooling immediately following\nlarge volcanic eruptions. (Flato et al. 2013: 743) \n\n\nIn many other cases, however, it is more difficult to gauge the extent\nto which model-data comparisons provide evidence of a model's similarity to the climate system or its\nadequacy for particular purposes. There are a number of complicating\nfactors. \n\nFirst, differences between modeling results and observational data\nmight not be due to shortcomings of the climate model. Climate\ndatasets can contain errors or have uncertainties that are\nunderestimated or not reported. Indeed, in more than one\ncase, it has turned out that model-data conflicts were resolved\nlargely in favor of the models (see, e.g., Lloyd 2012). There also\nhave been cases where a poor fit between modeling results and data was judged to\nbe due in part to errors in assumptions about the external conditions\n(e.g., aerosol concentrations) that obtained during the simulated\nperiod (e.g., Santer et al. 2014, 2017). More fundamental is an issue\nrelated to the initial conditions of climate simulations (see also\nSchmidt & Sherwood 2015). Oftentimes, a simulation for a\nparticular period is launched from a representative state that is\narrived at after letting the climate model run for a while under\nexternal conditions like those assumed to hold at the start of the\nperiod of interest; this \u201cspin up\u201d of the model is needed to\nallow its various components to come into balance with one another.\nSince this representative state inevitably differs somewhat from the\nactual conditions at the start of the period of interest (e.g., on Jan\n1, 1900), and since the climate system is believed to be chaotic, the\nsimulation cannot be expected to closely track observations throughout\nthe period, even if the model perfectly represents all climate system\nprocesses; the goal is for differences between climate simulations and\nobservations to be no larger than would result when running a perfect\nmodel from other initial states that are consistent with the external\nconditions at the start of the period of interest (i.e., no larger than\ndifferences stemming from internal variability).\n\nInterpretation can be difficult even when there is relatively good fit\nbetween modeling results and observational data. One reason is that,\nto varying degrees, today\u2019s climate models have been tuned to\ntwentieth century observations. Tuning sometimes delivers an improved\nscore on a performance metric by compensating for errors elsewhere in\nthe model (Petersen 2000), and the stability of errors is not\nguaranteed as external conditions change, e.g., as greenhouse gas\nconcentrations continue to rise (Stainforth et al. 2007; Knutti 2008).\nSome climate scientists suggest that data used in tuning cannot be\nused subsequently in model evaluation (e.g., Randall et al. 2007: 596;\nFlato et al. 2013: 750). Steele and Werndl (2013, 2016), however,\nargue that in some circumstances it is legitimate to use data for both\ncalibration (i.e., tuning) and confirmation, something they illustrate\nwith both Bayesian and frequentist methodologies. Frisch (2015)\nadvocates what he calls a moderate predictivism in this\ncontext: if a climate model is tuned to achieve a good fit with data\nfor a particular variable, this provides less support for the\nhypothesis that the model can deliver the same performance with\nrespect to other predictions for that variable (e.g., future values),\ncompared to the case when the good fit is achieved without tuning (see\nalso Stainforth et al. 2007; Katzav et al. 2012; Mauritsen et al.\n2012; Schmidt & Sherwood 2015). Frisch defends this view on the\ngrounds that successful simulation without tuning gives us more reason\nto think that a climate model has accurately represented key processes\nshaping the variable of interest; if we were already confident of the\nlatter, then successful simulation without tuning would not have such\nan advantage. In any case, to take account of tuning in model\nevaluation, it is important to know what tuning has been done, and\nthis information is often not readily available (see\n Section 4.2).\n\nA further complication is that, in many cases, the\n\u201cobservations\u201d used in climate model evaluation are\nreanalysis datasets whose contents are determined in part by model-based\nweather forecasts (Edwards 1999,\n2010; Flato et al. 2013: Table 9.3; see also\n Section 3.2\n above). Since weather forecasting models and climate models can\nincorporate some similar idealizations and simplifications, the worry\narises that fit between reanalyses and climate modeling results might\nbe artificially inflated in some respects, due to shared imperfections. Identifying such artificial inflation of fit can be\nchallenging, given limited availability of independent observations,\ni.e., ones not used in producing the reanalysis. Leuschner (2015:\n370), however, suggests that a focus on the shared assumptions\nthemselves might be a promising way forward; the adequacy of shared\nassumptions about the radiative effects of aerosols, for instance,\nmight be established via comparison with the results of laboratory\nexperiments (see also Frigg et al. 2015b: 957).\n\nLastly, when it comes to evaluating the adequacy of climate models for\nsome purposes, especially predictive purposes, it can be difficult to\nknow what sort of fit with past climate conditions would even count as\nevidence of a climate model\u2019s adequacy-for-purpose (Parker\n2009). How accurately should a climate model simulate various features\nof past climate if it is adequate for, say, predicting future changes\nin global mean surface temperature to within some specified margin of\nerror? This can be very difficult to answer, not only because there is\nmore than one way to achieve such predictive accuracy (e.g., by\ndistributing error differently across contributing variables), but\nalso because simplifications and idealizations in the model, as well\nas tuned components, might work better under some external conditions\nthan others, e.g., under those of the recent past rather than those\nassumed in future scenarios (see ibid.). Katzav (2014) suggests that,\nin practice, attempts to determine what sort of fit with past\nconditions would count as evidence of a climate model\u2019s\nadequacy-for-purpose will often rely on results from climate models\nthemselves, in a way that is question-begging.\n\nGiven these challenges, climate model evaluation today often focuses\nprimarily on describing the extent to which modeling results fit with\nobservations and on characterizing how that fit has improved from one\ngeneration of models to the next; it tends to reach only relatively\nmodest conclusions about the adequacy of climate models for\nparticular purposes. For example, recent Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) reports have concluded that today\u2019s\nclimate models provide \u201ccredible quantitative estimates\u201d\nof climate system conditions in support of climate change detection,\nattribution and projection (see\n Section 5),\n where this credibility is underwritten both by how the models are\nconstructed\u2014i.e., their grounding in basic physical\nprinciples\u2014and by how they perform on a wide range of metrics\n(see Randall et al. 2007; Flato et al. 2013; see also Knutti 2008).\nThe credibility of results is judged to be greater for larger spatial\nscales (i.e., for quantities averaged over global or continental\nscales) and for variables that are less spatially heterogeneous (e.g.,\nfor temperature and pressure as opposed to precipitation), but the\nexpected accuracy of modeling results used in detection, attribution\nand projection studies is rarely explicitly quantified. To begin to move the discussion forward, Baumberger et al. (2017) draw on both philosophical and scientific resources to outline a conceptual framework intended to aid evaluation of the adequacy of climate models for particular purposes; they point to empirical accuracy, robustness, and coherence with background knowledge as relevant considerations (see also Knutti (2018: 11.4), highlighting the importance of \"process understanding\").\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that a significant motivation for model\nevaluation studies is model improvement: model evaluation activities\ncan be directed toward understanding why a model\u2019s results\nexhibit particular errors, in the hope of improving the model in\nfuture. Lenhard and Winsberg (2010), however, suggest that such\n\u201canalytical understanding\u201d of climate model performance is\nlargely out of reach. They argue that features of climate models,\nincluding their complexity, their fuzzy modularity (see\n Section 4.2)\n and their incorporation of \u201ckludges\u201d\u2014unprincipled\nfixes applied in model development to make the model as a whole work\nbetter\u2014will often make it very difficult to apportion blame for\npoor simulation performance to different parts of climate models;\nclimate modeling, they argue, faces a particularly challenging variety\nof confirmational holism (see also Petersen 2000). As\nempirical support, they point to the limited success of model\nintercomparison projects (e.g., Taylor et al. 2012) in identifying the\nsources of disagreement in climate model simulations. However, there\nhave been some notable successes in localizing sources of error and\ndisagreement in climate simulations. For example, differences in the\nrepresentation of cloud processes have been identified as a major\nsource of disagreement among estimates of climate sensitivity (Flato\net al. 2013: 743). Likewise, a growing body of work on \u201cemergent\nconstraints\u201d has uncovered sources of spread in various aspects\nof climate change projections (see, e.g., Qu & Hall 2007 and\nsubsequent work; Frigg et al. 2015c). Thus, while Lenhard and Winsberg\nare surely right that it is difficult to achieve analytical\nunderstanding of climate model performance, just how limited the\nprospects are seems an open question.\n",
