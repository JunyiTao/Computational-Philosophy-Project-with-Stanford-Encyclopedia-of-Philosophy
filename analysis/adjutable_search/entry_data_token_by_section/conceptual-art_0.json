    "main_text": "Conceptual Art \u2013 What Is It? || Introduction\n1.1 Introduction\n\nFew artistic movements have attracted so much controversy and debate\nas conceptual art. By its nature, conceptual art has a tendency to\nprovoke intense and perhaps even extreme reactions in its audiences.\nWhile some people find conceptual art very refreshing and relevant,\nmany others consider it shocking, distasteful, and conspicuously\nlacking in craftsmanship. Some even simply deny that it is art at all.\nConceptual art, it seems, is something that we either love or\nhate.\n\nThis divisive character is, however, far from accidental. Most\nconceptual art actively sets out to be controversial in so far as it\nseeks to challenge and probe us about what we tend to take as given in\nthe domain of art. In fact, this capacity to evoke argument and debate\nlies at the very heart of what conceptual art sets out to do, namely\nto make us question our assumptions not only about what may properly\nqualify as art and what the function of the artist should be, but also\nabout what our role as spectators should involve. It should come as no\nsurprise, then, that conceptual art can cause frustration or vexation\n\u2013 to raise difficult and sometimes even annoying questions is\nprecisely what conceptual art in general aspires to do. In reacting\nstrongly to conceptual art we are, in some important sense, playing\nright into its hands.\n\nThe first difficulty that a philosophical investigation of conceptual\nart encounters has to do with identifying the object of examination,\nor at least the category of objects under scrutiny. In the words of\nthe art historian Paul Wood,\n\n[i]t is not at all clear where the boundaries of \u2018conceptual\nart\u2019 are to be drawn, which artists and which works to include.\nLooked at in one way, conceptual art gets to be like Lewis\nCarroll\u2019s Cheshire cat, dissolving away until nothing is left\nbut a grin: a handful of works made over a few short years by a small\nnumber of artists\u2026 Then again, regarded under a different\naspect, conceptual art can seem like nothing less than the hinge\naround which the past turned into the present. (Wood 2002, 6)\n\n\nOn a strict historical reading, the expression \u2018conceptual\nart\u2019 refers to the artistic movement that reached its pinnacle\nbetween 1966 and 1972 (Lippard\n 1973).[1]\n Among its most famous adherents at its early stage we find artists\nsuch as Joseph Kosuth, Robert Morris, Joseph Beuys, Adrian Piper, to\nname but a few. What unites the conceptual art of this period is the\nabsorption of the lessons learnt from other twentieth-century art\nmovements such as Dadaism, Surrealism, Suprematism, Abstract\nExpressionism and the Fluxus group, together with the ambition once\nand for all to \u2018free\u2019 art of the Modernist paradigm. Most\nimportantly, perhaps, conceptual art of the 1960s and 70s sought to\novercome a backdrop against which art\u2019s principal aim is to\nproduce something beautiful or aesthetically pleasing. Art, early\nconceptual artists held, is redundant if it does not make us think. In\ntheir belief that most artistic institutions were not conducive to\nreflection but merely promoted a conservative and even consumerist\nconception of art and artists, conceptual artists in the mid-1960s to\nthe early 1970s instead tried to encourage a revisionary understanding\nof art, the artist, and artistic experience.\n\nWhile conceptual art in its purest form might arguably be limited to\nworks produced during these five or six years half a century ago, it\nseems overly narrow \u2013 certainly from a philosophical perspective\n\u2013 to limit our inquiry to works produced during that period\nalone. For although the work created during that time might generally\nbe conceived as more directly anti-establishment and anti-consumerist\nthan later conceptual art, the spirit of early conceptual art seems to\nhave carried on relatively undiluted into the very late twentieth and\ntwenty-first centuries, as witnessed by pieces such as Tracey\nEmin\u2019s Unmade Bed, Damian Hirst\u2019s The\nPhysical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,\nand Ai Weiwei\u2019s Surveillance Camera.\n\nThe highly individualised character of the intellectual exploration\nthat conceptual art urges us to engage in has always been such that\nany attempt to pinpoint a specific common denominator other than this\ngeneral vision and approach to art, art-making and society at large\ninvariably fails to catch its very essence. The means of artistic\nexpression, we are told, are infinite and the topics available for\nquestioning and discussion are limitless. It belongs to the very\nnature of conceptual art, then, to be \u2013 like Lewis\u2019\nCheshire cat \u2013 elusive and slippery. Conceptual artists, be it\nJoseph Beuys or Marina Abramovic, pursue artistic originality and\nrepresentation in every possible way. For that reason, one\nmight find oneself obliged to replace the slightly lofty clich\u00e9\naccording to which there are as many definitions of conceptual art as\nthere are conceptual artists, with an even more extreme version of the\nclaim, namely, that there are as many definitions of conceptual art as\nthere are conceptual artworks.\n\nNevertheless, in the midst of this deliberately produced uncertainty\nabout the nature of conceptual art, a handful of characteristics and\ngeneral aims do seem to recur, and although they should not be seen as\ncriteria for conceptual art strictly speaking, they may be considered\ntenets fundamental to (most) conceptual art.\n",
