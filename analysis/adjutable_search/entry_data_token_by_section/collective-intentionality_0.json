    "main_text": "The Central Problem\n1. The Central Problem\n\nSuppose you intend to visit the Taj Mahal tomorrow, and I intend to\nvisit the Taj Mahal tomorrow. This does not make it the case that\nwe intend to visit the Taj Mahal together. If I know about your plan,\nI may express (or refer to) our intention in the form \u201cwe intend\nto visit the Taj Mahal tomorrow\u201d. But this does not imply\nanything collective about our intentions. Even if knowledge about our\nplan is common, mutual, or open between us, my intention and your\nintention may still be purely individual. For us to intend to visit\nthe Taj Mahal together is something different.\n\nDistributions (summations, aggregates) of individual intentions do not\nmake for collective intentions, even if combined with common\nknowledge, or mutual belief. This is accepted by an increasing number\nof contributors to the recent debate. Collectively intentional\nattitudes are not just sets of run-of-the-mill individual intentional\nattitudes combined with common knowledge or mutual belief. Another way\nof putting this is to say that collective intentionality is\nirreducible to individual intentionality (though this is\ngenerally accepted only insofar as individual intentionality is\nnarrowly understood). It is only in virtue of its irreducibility that\nthe intentional state in question can be attributed to the\nparticipants as a group.\n\nWhat does it mean for us to intend as a group? Surely, if we\nintend to visit the Taj Mahal together, it is you and me who intend\nthe shared activity, not some third subject over and above our heads,\nthe group. That we intend as a group does not displace you\nand me as the intenders of the action in question. To say that the\ngroup intends to go for a walk is the same as saying that the\nparticipating individuals intend to go for a walk\u2014 if\n\u201ctogether\u201d is added to the latter clause (and where\nexactly it has to be inserted is a crucial philosophical question).\nCollective intentions can be attributed to individuals, but only\ncollectively, it seems, and not distributively. The view that the\nintentional attitudes in question are the participant\nindividuals\u2019 collectively rather than distributively, however,\nis in tension with the view that even if an individual participates in\ncollective intentionality, all the intentional attitudes that\nindividuals has are their own (the Individual Ownership Thesis).\n\nOn the naturalist version of the Individual Ownership Thesis, any\n(primary) intentional state is a higher order feature of a brain. It\nis not the case that in collective intentionality, individual brains\nare integrated in a Borg-like manner to form a collective super-brain.\nTherefore, it seems that collective intentionality reduces to an\naggregate, or combination, of individual brain states. According to an\ninternalist version, all the intentionality an individual has is\nstructurally independent of the existence or non-existence of anything\noutside the individual mind. The question of whether or not an\nindividual\u2019s intentional states are collective is therefore\nsettled by internal features of individual minds. A third version,\nthat might seem attractive to non-naturalists and externalists,\nemphasizes that intentional states are, or involve, commitments. It\nseems, however, that only an individual agent\u2019s own intentional\nstates can commit them to a particular course of action, or to\ninferences. Other individuals\u2019 intentional states may provide an\nagent with a reason only on the base of what they themselves believe\nor desire. Thus, it seems that the commitments involved in collective\nintentional states are the individual commitments of each of the\nparticipants.\n\nIn all of these and related versions of the Individual Ownership\nThesis, the basic claim is that each individual has a mind of their\nown and has a sort of intentional autonomy that is incompatible with\nthe view that individual minds are somehow fused when intentional\nstates are shared. Thus, the Individual Ownership Thesis places tight\nrestrictions on non-reductivism about collective intentionality. Most\nparticipants in the current debate accept a version of the\nIrreducibility Claim, and a version of the Individual Ownership\nThesis, and they set out to show how these could be modified in such a\nway as to be mutually compatible.\n",
