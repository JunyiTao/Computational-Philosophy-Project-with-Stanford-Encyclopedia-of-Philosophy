    "main_text": "\n\nIsaiah Berlin (1909\u201397) was a naturalised British philosopher,\nhistorian of ideas, political theorist, educator, public intellectual\nand moralist, and essayist. He was renowned for his conversational\nbrilliance, his defence of liberalism and pluralism, his opposition to\npolitical extremism and intellectual fanaticism, and his accessible,\ncoruscating writings on people and ideas. His essay Two Concepts\nof Liberty (1958) contributed to a revival of interest in\npolitical theory in the English-speaking world, and remains one of the\nmost influential and widely discussed texts in that field: admirers\nand critics agree that Berlin\u2019s distinction between positive and\nnegative liberty remains, for better or worse, a basic starting point\nfor discussions of the meaning and value of political freedom. Later\nin his life, the greater availability of his numerous essays began to\nprovoke increasing interest in his work, particularly in the idea of\nvalue pluralism; that Berlin\u2019s articulation of value pluralism\ncontains many ambiguities and even obscurities has only encouraged\nfurther work on this rich and important topic by other\nphilosophers.\n",
