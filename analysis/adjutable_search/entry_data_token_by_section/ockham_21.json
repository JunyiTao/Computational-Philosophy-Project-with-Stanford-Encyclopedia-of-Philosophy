    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The Ideal of Poverty\n8.1 The Ideal of Poverty\n\nThe ideal of poverty had been (and still is) a common one in religious\ncommunities. Typically, the idea is that the individual member of the\norder owns no property at all. If a member buys a car, for instance,\nit is not strictly his car, even though he may have exclusive use of\nit, and it was not bought with his money; he doesn\u2019t have any\nmoney of his own. Rather it belongs to the order.\n\nThe original Franciscan ideal went further. Not only did the\nindividual friar have no property of his own, neither did the\norder. The Franciscans, therefore, were really supposed to be\n\u201cmendicants,\u201d to live by begging. Anything donated to the\norder, such as a house or a piece of land, strictly speaking remained\nthe property of the original owner (who merely granted the\nuse of it to the Franciscans). (Or, if that would not\nwork\u2014as, for example, in the case of a bequest in a will, after\nthe original owner had died\u2014the ownership would go to the\nPapacy.)\n\nBoth the Spirituals and the Conventuals thought this ideal of\nuncompromising poverty was exhibited by the life of Jesus and the\nApostles, who\u2014they said\u2014had given up all property, both\nindividually and collectively. St. Francis regarded this as\nthe clear implication of several Scriptural passages: e.g., Matt.\n6:24\u201334, 8:20, 19:21. In short, the Apostolic (and Franciscan)\nideal was, \u201cLive without a safety net.\u201d\n\nOf course, if everyone lived according to this ideal, so that no one\nowned any property either individually or collectively, then there\nwould be no property at all. The Franciscan ideal, then, shared by\nConventuals and Spirituals alike, entailed the total abolition of all\nproperty rights.\n\nNot everyone shared this view. Outside the Franciscan order, most\ntheoreticians agreed that Jesus and the Apostles lived without\nindividual property, but thought they did share property collectively.\nNevertheless, Pope Nicholas III, in 1279, had officially approved the\nFranciscan view, not just as a view about how to organize the\nFranciscan order, but about the interpretation of the Scriptural\npassages concerning Jesus and the Apostles. His approval did not mean\nhe was endorsing the Franciscan reading as the correct interpretation\nof Scripture, but only that it was a permissible one, that there was\nnothing doctrinally suspect about\n it.[54]\n\nNevertheless, this interpretation was a clear reproach to the Papacy,\nwhich at Avignon was wallowing in wealth to a degree it had never seen\nbefore. The clear implication of the Franciscan view, therefore, was\nthat the Avignon Popes were conspicuously not living their\nlives as an \u201cimitation of Christ.\u201d Whether for this reason\nor another, the Avignon Pope John XXII decided to reopen discussion of\nthe question of Apostolic poverty and to come to some resolution of\nthe matter. But, as Mollat [1963] puts it (perhaps not without some\ntaking of\n sides):[55]\n\nWhen discussions began at Avignon, conflicting opinions were freely\nput forward. Meanwhile, Michael of Cesena, acting with insolent\naudacity, did not await the Holy See\u2019s decision: on 30 May 1322\nthe chapter-general [of the Franciscan order] at Perugia declared\nitself convinced of the absolute poverty of Christ and the Apostles.\n\n\nIt was this act that provoked John XXII to issue his first\ncontribution to the dispute, his bull Ad conditorem in 1322.\nThere he put the whole matter in a legal framework.\n",
