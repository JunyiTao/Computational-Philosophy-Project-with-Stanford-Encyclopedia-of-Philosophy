Dynamics of properties\n\nAs we have seen, modal interpretations intend to provide, for every\ninstant, a set of definite-valued properties and their probabilities.\nSome advocates of modal interpretations are willing to leave the\nmatter at that. Others take it to be crucial that also questions of\nthe following form are answered: given that the property \\(P\\) of a\nsystem has the actual value \\(\\alpha\\) at time \\(t_0\\), what is the\nprobability that its property \\(P'\\) has the actual value \\(\\beta\\) at\ntime \\(t_1 \\gt t_0\\)? In other words, they want a dynamics of\nactual properties.\n\nThere are arguments on both sides (van Fraassen 1997). Those who argue for the necessity\nof such a dynamics maintain that we have to assure that the\ntrajectories of actual properties really are, at\nleast for macroscopic objects, like we see them to be, i.e., like the\nrecords contained in memories. For example, we should require not only\nthat the book at rest on the desk possesses a definite location, but\nalso that, if undisturbed, its location relative to the desk does not\nchange in time. Accordingly, one cannot get away with simply\nspecifying possible definite properties at each instant of time. We\nneed also to show that this specification is at least compatible with\na reasonable dynamics; better still, to specify this dynamics\nexplicitly.\n\nThose who consider a dynamics of actual properties to be superfluous\nreply that such a dynamics is more than what an interpretation of\nquantum mechanics needs to provide. Memory contents for each instant\nare enough to make empirical adequacy possible.\n\nRuetsche (2003) argues that it is important in this connection whether\nthe modal interpretation is viewed as leading to a\nhidden-variables theory, in which value states are added as\nhidden variables to the original formalism in order to obtain a full\ndescription of the physical situation, or rather as an interpretive\nmove that equips the original formalism with a new semantics (see also\nSection 11). In the first case one would expect a full dynamics of\nactual properties, in the second this is not so clear.\n\nOf course, modal interpretations admit a trivial dynamics, namely, one\nin which there is no correlation from one time to the next. In this\ncase, the probability of the transition from the property \\(P\\) having\nthe actual value \\(\\alpha\\) at \\(t_0\\) to the property \\(P'\\) having\nthe actual value \\(\\beta\\) at \\(t_1 \\gt t_0\\) is just the single-time\nprobability for \\(P'\\) having \\(\\beta\\) at \\(t_1\\). However, this\ndynamics is unlikely to interest those who feel the need for a\ndynamics at all. Several researchers have contributed to the project\nof constructing a more interesting form of dynamics for modal\ninterpretations (see Vermaas 1996, 1998). An important account is due\nto Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999, see also Bacciagaluppi 1998). That\nwork shows the most significant challenges that the construction of a\ndynamics of actual properties must face.\n\nThe first challenge is posed by the fact that the set of\ndefinite-valued properties\u2014let us call it\n\u2018\\(S\\)\u2019\u2014may change over time. One therefore has to\ndefine a family of maps, each one being a 1\u20131 map from \\(S_0\\)\nat time \\(t_0\\) to a different \\(S_t\\) at time \\(t\\), for any time.\nWith such a family of maps, one can effectively define conditional\nprobabilities within a single state space, and then translate them\ninto \u201ctransition\u201d probabilities. For this technique to\nwork, \\(S_t\\) must have the same cardinality at any time. However, in\ngeneral this is not the case: for instance, in SDMI, the number of\ndifferent projectors appearing in the spectral decomposition of the\ndensity matrix may vary with time.\n\nA way out of this is to augment \\(S\\) at each time so that its\ncardinality matches the highest cardinality that \\(S\\) ever achieves.\nOf course, one hopes to do so in a way that is not completely ad hoc.\nFor example, in the context of SDMI, Bacciagaluppi, Donald and Vermaas\n(1995) show that the \u201ctrajectory\u201d through Hilbert space of\nthe spectral components of the reduced state of a physical system\nwill, under reasonable conditions, be continuous, or have only\nisolated discontinuities, so that the trajectory can be naturally\nextended to a continuous trajectory (see also Donald 1998). This\nresult suggests a natural family of maps as discussed above, which map\neach spectral component at one time to its unique continuous evolved\ncomponent at later times.\n\nThe second challenge to the construction of a dynamics arises from the\nfact that one wants to define transition probabilities over\ninfinitesimal units of time, and then derive the finite-time\ntransition probabilities from them. Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999)\nargue that, adapting results from the theory of stochastic processes,\none can show that the procedure may be carried out for modal\ninterpretations of at least some varieties.\n\nFinally, one must define infinitesimal transition probabilities that\nwill give rise to the proper quantum-mechanical probabilities at each\ntime. Following earlier papers by Bell (1984), Vink (1993), and\nothers, Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999) define an infinite class of\nsuch infinitesimal transition probabilities, such that all of them\ngenerate the correct single-time probabilities, which arguably are all\nwe can really test. However, Sudbery (2002) has contended that the\nform of the transition probabilities would be relevant to the\nprecise form of spontaneous decay or the \u201cDehmelt quantum\njumps\u201d; he independently develops the dynamics of Bacciagaluppi\nand Dickson and applies it in such a way that it leads to the correct\npredictions for these experiments. Gambetta and Wiseman (2003, 2004)\nhave developed a dynamical modal account in the form of a\nnon-Markovian process with noise, also extending their approach to\npositive operator-valued measures (POVMs). More recently, Hollowood\n(2013a, 2013b, 2014) has elaborated the idea that the dynamics of\nvalue states can be modeled by a discrete-time Markov chain.\n",
