    "main_text": "Controversies about Application || Emergencies\n8.4 Emergencies\n\nIs it reasonable to use the Rule of Law to evaluate the way a society\nresponds to emergencies? It is often thought that emergencies require\nforms of state action that are more peremptory and less procedurally\nlaborious than those required in normal times. As a matter of fact, a\nnumber of possibilities have been discussed (Scheuerman 2006). One is\nto insist, in the name of the Rule of Law, that existing\nconstitutional safeguards should remain in force; that, after all, is\nwhat they were designed for and these situations are where they are\nmost urgently needed. Alternatively, in emergencies, one might rely on\na general spirit of flexibility and circumstantial sensitivity in\nstate action that is encouraged even in normal times. On this second\noption, the Rule of Law does not present itself as a major constraint\non the flexibility of state action in face of danger. As a third\noption, one might seek to preserve something like the Rule of Law by\nlaying down in advance specific legal rules to govern\nemergencies\u2014rules that suspend ordinary civil liberties\nguarantees for example or authorize widespread discretion on the part\nof officials to undertake action that would normally be governed by\ngeneral rules of law. (Machiavelli proposed a version of this in his\nDiscourses (1517), extolling the institution of dictator in\nthe Roman republic.) This option has the advantage of predictability;\nbut its disadvantage is that it endorses a sort of\nRule-of-Law-lite, which may eventually infect or supersede\nthe conception of the Rule of Law that is supposed to be normally\napplicable.\n",
