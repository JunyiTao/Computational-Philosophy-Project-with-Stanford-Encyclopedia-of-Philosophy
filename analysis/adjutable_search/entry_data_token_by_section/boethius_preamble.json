    "main_text": "\n\nAnicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (born: circa 475\u20137 C.E.,\ndied: 526? C.E.) has long been recognized as one of the most important\nintermediaries between ancient philosophy and the Latin Middle Ages\nand, through his Consolation of Philosophy, as a talented\nliterary writer, with a gift for making philosophical ideas dramatic\nand accessible to a wider public. He had previously translated\nAristotle\u2019s logical works into Latin, written commentaries on\nthem as well as logical textbooks, and used his logical training to\ncontribute to the theological discussions of the time. All these\nwritings, which would be enormously influential in the Middle Ages,\ndrew extensively on the thinking of Greek Neoplatonists such as\nPorphyry and Iamblichus. Boethius was not just an intermediary,\nhowever. He was an independent thinker, though one working within a\ntradition which put little obvious weight on philosophical\noriginality. Both aspects of Boethius will be considered in the\nsections which follow.\n",
