    "main_text": "Applications || Document retrieval and clustering applications\n10.2 Document retrieval and clustering applications\n\nInformation retrieval has long been a central theme of information\nscience, covering retrieval of both structured data such as are found\nin relational databases as well as unstructured text documents (e.g.,\nSalton 1989). Retrieval criteria for the two types of data are not\nunrelated, since both structured and unstructured data often require\ncontent-directed retrieval. For example, while users of an\nemployee database may wish at times to retrieve employee records by\nthe unique name or ID of employees, at other times they may wish to\nretrieve all employees in a certain employment category, perhaps with\nfurther restrictions such as falling into a certain salary bracket.\nThis is accomplished with the use of \u201cinverted files\u201d that\nessentially index entities under their attributes and values rather\nthan their identifiers. In the same way, text documents might be\nretrieved via some unique label, or they might instead be\nretrieved in accord with their relevance to a certain query\nor topic header. The simplest notion of relevance is that the\ndocuments should contain the terms (words or short phrases) of the\nquery.  However, terms that are distinctive for a document should\nbe given more weight. Therefore a standard measure of relevance, given\na particular query term, is the tf\u2013idf  (term\nfrequency\u2013inverse document frequency) for the term, which\nincreases (e.g.,\nlogarithmically) with the frequency of occurrences of\nthe term in the document but is discounted to the extent that it occurs\nfrequently in the set of documents as a whole. Summing the tf-idf's of\nthe query terms yields a simple measure of document relevance.\nShortcomings of this method are first, that it underrates term\nco-occurrences if each term occurs commonly in the document collection\n(for instance, for the query \u201crods and cones of the eye\u201d,\nco-occurrences of rods, cones, and eye may\nwell characterize relevant documents, even though all three terms\noccur quite commonly in non-physiological contexts), and second, that\nrelevant documents might have few occurrences of the query terms,\nwhile containing many semantically related terms. Some of the vector\nmethods mentioned in connection with document clustering can be used\nto alleviate these shortcomings. We may reduce the dimensionality of\nthe term-based vector space using LSA, obtaining a much smaller\n\u201cconcept space\u201d in which many terms that tend to co-occur\nin documents will have been merged into the same dimensions\n(concept). Thus sharing of concepts, rather than sharing of specific\nterms, becomes the basis for measuring relevance.\nDocument clustering is useful when large numbers of documents need\nto be organized for easy access to topically related items, for\ninstance in collections of patent descriptions, medical histories or\nabstracts, legal precedents, or captioned images, often in hierarchical\nfashion. Clustering is also useful in exploratory data analysis (e.g.,\nin exploring\ntoken occurrences in an unknown language), and indirectly supports\nvarious NLP applications because of its utility in improving language\nmodels, for instance in providing word clusters to be used for backing\noff from specific words in cases of data sparsity.\nClustering is widely used in other areas, such as biological and\nmedical research and epidemiology, market research and grouping and\nrecommendation of shopping items, educational research, social network\nanalysis, geological analysis, and many others.\nDocument retrieval and clustering often serve as preliminary steps\nin information extraction (IE) or text mining, two overlapping\nareas concerned with extracting useful knowledge from documents, such\nas the main features of named entities (category, roles in relation to\nother entities, location, dates, etc.) or of particular types of\nevents, or inferring rule-like correlations between relational terms\n(e.g., that purchasing of one\ntype of product correlates with\npurchasing another).\nWe will not attempt to survey IE/text mining applications\ncomprehensively, but the next two subsections, on summarization and\nsentiment analysis, are subareas of particular interest here because of\ntheir emphasis on the semantic content of texts.\n\n",
