    "main_text": "The Legacy of Ancient Atomism || Ancient Greek Atomism in Later European Philosophy\n3.2 Ancient Greek Atomism in Later European Philosophy\n\nAristotelian natural philosophy came to predominate in the medieval\nLatin West during the 13th century, and prevailed in the universities\ninto the seventeenth century. Nonetheless, scholars recognize pockets\nof interest in atomist thought in the middle ages, including a 12th\ncentury \u2018renaissance\u2019 of atomism (Pabst 1991, 1994; Grant\n1996; Dijksterhuis 1961), and the work of the 14th century\n\u2018indivisibilists,\u2019 who focused on the mathematics of\nmotion (Duhem 1985; Murdoch 1982, 1984). Reasons for the renewed\ninterest in atomist thought have been linked to the vision of a\nrelatively autonomous nature found in Timaeus (Pabst 1994),\nand to the need to account for motion of immaterial bodies like angels\n(Murdoch 1984). Medical authors and Latin sources were important in\nthe transmission of ideas from antiquity to the 12th century, for whom\nthe atomist theories in the Arabic tradition were largely inaccessible\n(Pabst 1994, 86). Later medieval Latin philosophers would have access\nto ideas from the Islamic atomist tradition through Maimonides\u2019\nreports and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s refutations: modern scholarly\nopinions differ as to the extent to which Latin theorists were aware\nof Islamic atomism, however: recent scholarship has uncovered more\nevidence of borrowings from the Islamic world into the 14th century\nLatin texts (Murdoch 1974; Sorabji 1982; Freudenthal 2003; Grellard\n2009; Robert 2009).\n\nAlthough 12th century atomists were inspired by Plato,\nCalcidius\u2019 widely circulated commentary did not include the\npassages detailing Plato\u2019s geometrical atomism: instead, they\ndeveloped particle theories and attempted to reconcile these with the\ndoctrine of the four elements. An original attempt by Thierry of\nChartes to solve the problem of the different motions of the four\nelements\u2014fire and air tending upward, earth and water tending\ndownward to different degrees\u2014relied on the relative\ncohesiveness of different elements to explain the different degrees of\nmobility (Pabst 1991). Elemental intertransformation shows that\nelements must be composed of atoms of similar substance, but fire\natoms, say, are less entangled with one another and thus more mobile\nthan other kinds of atoms. Other classic problems, including puzzles\nabout the different speeds of particles of a rotating wheel, continued\nto occupy theorists into the early modern period; this problem was\ncalled rota Aristotelis or \u2018Aristotle\u2019s\nwheel\u2019 because of its appearance in the pseudo-Aristotelian\nMechanica (Palmerino 2001).\n\nRenaissance alchemy, as much as the reworking of ancient Greek atomist\ntheories by adherents of the \u2018New Science\u2019 of the\nseventeenth century, proved important sources of inspiration for\ncorpuscularian theories in the early modern world (Newman 2006). The\nAristotelian notion of minima naturalia, and the appeal to\nmicrostructures of matter in explanation of chemical changes in\nAristotle\u2019s Meteorology IV, meant that consideration of\ncorpuscularian explanations need not automatically be framed as a\nrejection of Aristotle. A useful corrective here to the tendency to\nregard early modern atomism as merely reviving ancient Greek theories\nis Newman\u2019s argument that an \u2018operational\u2019 notion of\nminima\u2014the smallest unit that seems to be manifest in the best\nexplanation of the observed phenomena\u2014emerged from the\nalchemical tradition and provided an alternative to the metaphysical\narguments of the ancient Greek atomists (Newman 2006, 2009).\n\nHero of Alexandria\u2019s matter theory has long been considered an\nimportant source for Robert Boyle and other New Scientists of the\nseventeenth century (Boas 1949). However, Hero\u2019s theory differed\nfrom classical atomism, and drew heavily on the need to explain\npneumatic effects (see section 2.6 above). The evidence of\nSennert\u2019s influence on Boyle casts further doubts on the\ncentrality of ancient Greek atomism to his matter theory. Newman\n(2006, 2009) argues that the relevant sense of \u2018atom\u2019\ndepended on the incapacity for chemical decomposition, not spatial or\nphysical indivisibility, a notion grounded in empirical evidence\nrather than logical or mathematical reasoning.\n\nMilton (2002) offers a helpful perspective on why ancient Greek\natomism, despite its naturalist worldview, was not especially\nconducive to scientific investigation. Features of seventeenth century\nNew Science that do not fit well with classical atomist theory include\nthe application of mathematical analysis to motion and the appeal to a\nmachine model to conceptualize the possibility that complex causal\nsequencing could produce regular and determinate results without\nongoing intelligent direction (Berryman 2009). A modern scholarly\ntendency to describe Democritean atomism as \u2018mechanistic\u2019\ncontributes to a prevailing overestimate of the scientific credentials\nof ancient Greek atomism.\n\nEpicurean philosophy played a very different role in the seventeenth\nand eighteenth centuries, providing a classical \u2018cover\u2019\nfor hedonistic and anti-religious sentiment among intellectuals\nattracted by the vision of a tranquil life free of fear of the gods\n(Kargon 1966; Wilson 2008). Women philosophers and intellectuals were\nunusually prominent amongst the seventeenth century advocates and\ntranslators of Epicurus (Wilson 2008). The Cambridge Platonists may\nhave fueled the identification of atomism with atheism, because of the\npresentation of ancient Greek natural philosophy in Cudworth\u2019s\nTrue Intellectual System of the Universe. A tendency to\nmischaracterize Epicurean philosophy as licentious persisted.\n\nThe young Karl Marx wrote his doctoral dissertation on Democritus, a\nfact that may have contributed to his sensitivity to materialist\nexplanations. Given the association with Marx, Soviet-era scholarship\nproduced important work on Democritus, especially S.I. Luria\u2019s\nmagisterial edition of the fragments.\n",
