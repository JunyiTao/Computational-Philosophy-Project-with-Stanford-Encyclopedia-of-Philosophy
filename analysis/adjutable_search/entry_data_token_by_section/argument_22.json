Is there significant\nvariability in how people engage in argumentation depending on their\nsociocultural backgrounds? Or is argumentation largely the same\nphenomenon across different cultures? Actually, we may even ask\nourselves whether argumentation in fact occurs in all human cultures,\nor whether it is the product of specific, contingent background\nconditions, thus not being a human universal. For comparison: it had\nlong been assumed that practices of counting were present in all human\ncultures, even if with different degrees of complexity. But in recent\ndecades it has been shown that some cultures do not engage\nsystematically in practices of counting and basic arithmetic at all,\nsuch as the Pirah\u00e3 in the Amazon (Gordon 2004; see entry on\n culture and cognitive science).\n By analogy, it seems that the purported universality of argumentative\npractices should not be taken for granted, but rather be treated as a\nlegitimate empirical question. (Incidentally, there is some anecdotal\nevidence that the Pirah\u00e3 themselves engage in argumentative\nexchanges [Everett 2008], but to date their argumentative skills have\nnot been investigated systematically, as is the case with their\nnumerical skills.)\n\nOf course, how widespread argumentative practices will be also depends\non how the concept of \u201cargumentative practices\u201d is defined\nand operationalized in the first place. If it is narrowly defined as\ncorresponding to regimented practices of reason-giving requiring clear\nmarkers and explicit criteria for what counts as premises, conclusions\nand relations of support between them, then argumentation may well be\nrestricted to cultures and subcultures where such practices have been\nexplicitly codified. By contrast, if argumentation is defined more\nloosely, then a wider range of communicative practices will be\nconsidered as instances of argumentation, and thus presumably more\ncultures will be found to engage in (what is thus viewed as)\nargumentation. This means that the spread of argumentative practices\nacross cultures is not only an empirical question; it also requires\nsignificant conceptual input to be addressed.\n\nBut if (as appears to be the case) argumentation is not a strictly\nWEIRD phenomenon, restricted to Western, Educated, Industrialized,\nRich, and Democratic societies (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan\n2010), then the issue of cross-cultural variability in argumentative\npractices gives rise to a host of research questions, again both at\nthe descriptive and at the normative level. Indeed, even if at the\ndescriptive level considerable variability in argumentative practices\nis identified, the normative question of whether there should be\nuniversally valid canons for argumentation, or instead specific norms\nfor specific contexts, remains pressing. At the descriptive level, a\nnumber of researchers have investigated argumentative practices in\ndifferent WEIRD as well as non-WEIRD cultures, also addressing\nquestions of cultural variability (Hornikx & Hoeken 2007; Hornikx\n& de Best 2011).\n\nA foundational work in this context is Edwin Hutchins\u2019 1980 book\nCulture and Inference, a study of the Trobriand\nIslanders\u2019 system of land tenure in Papua New Guinea (Hutchins\n1980). While presented as a study of inference and reasoning among the\nTrobriand Islanders, what Hutchins in fact investigated were instances\nof legal argumentation in land courts by means of ethnographic\nobservation and interviews with litigants. This led to the formulation\nof a set of twelve basic propositions codifying knowledge about land\ntenure, as well as transfer formulas governing how this knowledge can\nbe applied to new disputes. Hutchins\u2019 analysis showed that the\nTrobriand Islanders had a sophisticated argumentation system to\nresolve issues pertaining to land tenure, in many senses resembling\nargumentation and reasoning in so-called WEIRD societies in that it\nseemed to recognize as valid simple logical structures such as\nmodus ponens and modus tollens.\n\nMore recently, Hugo Mercier and colleagues have been conducting\nstudies in countries such as Japan (Mercier, Deguchi, Van der Henst,\n& Yama 2016) and Guatemala (Castelain, Girotto, Jamet, &\nMercier 2016). While recognizing the significance and interest of\ncultural differences (Mercier 2013), Mercier maintains that\nargumentation is a human universal, as argumentative capacities and\ntendencies are a result of natural selection, genetically encoded in\nhuman cognition (Mercier 2011; Mercier & Sperber 2017). He takes\nthe results of the cross-cultural studies conducted so far as\nconfirming the universality of argumentation, even considering\ncultural differences (Mercier 2018).\n\nAnother scholar who has been carrying out an extensive research\nprogram on cultural differences in argumentation is communication\ntheorist Dale Hample. With different sets of colleagues, he has\nconducted studies by means of surveys where participants (typically,\nuniversity undergraduates) self-report on their argumentative\npractices in countries such as China, Japan, Turkey, Chile, the\nNetherlands, Portugal, the United States (among others; Hample 2018:\nch. 7). His results overall show a number of similarities, which may\nbe partially explained by the specific demographic (university\nstudents) from which participants are usually recruited. But\ninteresting differences have also been identified, for example\ndifferent levels of willingness to engage in argumentative\nencounters.\n\nIn a recent book (Tindale 2021), philosopher Chris Tindale adopts an\nanthropological perspective to investigate how argumentative practices\nemerge from the experiences of peoples with diverse backgrounds. He\nemphasizes the argumentative roles of place, orality, myth, narrative,\nand audience, also assessing the impacts of colonialism on the study\nof argumentation. Tindale reviews a wealth of anthropological and\nethnographic studies on argumentative practices in different cultures,\nthus providing what is to date perhaps the most comprehensive study on\nargumentation from an anthropological perspective.\n\nOn the whole, the study of differences and commonalities in\nargumentative practices across cultures is an established line of\nresearch on argumentation, but arguably much work remains to be done\nto investigate these complex phenomena more thoroughly.\n",
