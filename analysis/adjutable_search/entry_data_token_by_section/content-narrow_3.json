    "main_text": "Arguments for Broad Content || Responses to the Arguments\n2.3 Responses to the Arguments\n\nWe can distinguish between three broad categories of response to the\nexamples of Putnam and Burge. On one extreme, to use the terminology\nof Segal (2000), we have the unqualified acceptance of the extreme\nexternalist. Many philosophers have been persuaded by examples\nlike those of Putnam and Burge that all or nearly all mental\ncontent is broad. Such philosophers are highly skeptical about the\nusefulness of any notion of narrow content. Burge himself is a\nnoteworthy proponent of extreme externalism; other extreme\nexternalists include Robert Stalnaker (1989, 1990, 2008) and Robert A.\nWilson (1995).\n\nA second response takes us to the opposite extreme, extreme\ninternalism. According to this response, Putnam\u2019s and\nBurge\u2019s examples do not succeed in showing that any\ncontent is broad. This position has been defended by, among others,\nKent Bach (1987), Tim Crane (1991), and Gabriel Segal (2000). These\nauthors question the externalist interpretation of the examples we\nhave discussed. For example, in response to Putnam, Segal points out\nthat we have some empty natural kind concepts \u2014 that\nis, we have concepts which we intend to be natural kind concepts, but\nwhich in fact do not succeed in referring to a real kind. Possible\nexamples include the concepts of witches, ghosts, and phlogiston. In\nthese examples, the environment cannot make the sort of contribution\ndiscussed by Putnam, because the environment contains no relevant\nkind. Nevertheless, people who have them use these concepts in their\nreasoning, and their behavior is partly explained by these concepts.\nIf so, then we can have natural kind concepts that do not have an\nenvironmental component. Now, it seems that with respect to\nexplanations of our reasoning and action, it does not make a\ndifference whether the kinds we think we are reasoning about actually\nexist: so long as we think they exist, we will make the same\ninferences and perform the same actions regardless of whether we are\ncorrect or not. This may lead us to suspect that even in the case of\nnon-empty natural kind concepts, our reasoning and action are best\nexplained in terms of concepts whose content is not environmentally\ndetermined \u2014 in short, in terms of concepts whose content is\nnarrow.\n\nWith respect to Burge\u2019s examples, Segal suggests that it is odd\nto regard someone who thinks it possible to have arthritis in the\nthigh as having the concept of arthritis at all. Arthritis just\nis an inflammation of the joints; it seems peculiar to say\nthat someone who does not realize this has the concept of arthritis.\nInstead, we should say that the subject in Burge\u2019s example has a\ndifferent concept, a concept he mistakenly associates with\nthe English word \u2018arthritis\u2019. Thus we might want to deny\nthat Burge\u2019s subject really believes he has arthritis in his\nthigh. What he really believes is something it is hard to express in\nEnglish, since we do not have a word that applies to all and only the\ncases he would regard as cases of arthritis. (For a careful\npresentation and critique of this sort of \u201cdual concepts\u201d\nobjection to externalism, see Frances 2016.)\n\n\n(Segal takes these arguments to undermine the idea that Putnam\u2019s\nand Burge\u2019s examples establish that thoughts and beliefs about\nkinds have only broad contents. He does not take them to\nrefute \u201ctwo-factor\u201d theories according to which beliefs\nhave both broad and narrow contents, although he does offer additional\narguments specifically targeted against two-factor theories.)\n\nAlthough extreme internalists advocate narrow content, they also hold\nthat ordinary content is already narrow, so that we do not need a\nspecial or technical notion of narrow content. Thus, much of the\nliterature in favor of narrow content is written by those who accept\nthe third response to Putnam\u2019s and Burge\u2019s arguments,\nmoderate internalism (which we could equally well call\n\u201cmoderate externalism,\u201d since it is a compromise between\nthe two extreme views). This is the view that, while Putnam\u2019s\nand Burge\u2019s examples do show that ordinary content is broad,\nthere are also contents that are narrow. On a moderate\ninternalist view, many beliefs have both broad and narrow contents.\nSince, on this view, ordinary content is often broad, we need a\ndistinctive, specialized notion of narrow content as different in some\nway from ordinary content.\n",
