    "main_text": "\n\nDesiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam (1467?\u20131536) was not a\nsystematic philosopher although we discern in the large body of his\nwritings a certain Erasmian habit of mind. He often reflected on\nsubjects that invite philosophical inquiry: the influence of nature\nversus nurture, the relationship between word and thing, the ideal\nform of government, the nature of faith, and the theory of knowledge.\nErasmus\u2019 views on these subjects are of interest to historians\ntoday, even if they are unstructured, because his works circulated\nwidely and his influence in Northern Europe was pervasive. In modern\nparlance, he was an opinion maker. If a general label is needed,\nErasmus\u2019 thought is best described as \u201cChristian\nHumanism\u201d, that is, a philosophy of life combining Christian\nthought with classical traditions. He embraced the humanistic belief\nin an individual\u2019s capacity for self-improvement and the\nfundamental role of education in raising human beings above the level\nof brute animals. The thrust of Erasmus\u2019 educational programme\nwas the promotion of docta pietas, learned piety, or what he\ntermed the \u201cphilosophy of Christ\u201d. As a biblical scholar\nhe supported the humanistic call Ad fontes, a return to the\ntexts in the original language and therefore promoted the study of the\nbiblical languages Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. He was in the vanguard of\nmodern philology. His pioneering edition of the Greek New Testament\nshows that he had an understanding of the process of textual\ntransmission and had developed text-critical principles. In politics,\nErasmus embraced consensus, compromise, and peaceful cooperation,\nideals he recommended to the participants in the Reformation debate,\nalbeit with little success. Considered a forerunner of the Reformation\nby his contemporaries, he broke with Martin Luther over the\nlatter\u2019s sectarianism. More fundamentally, the two men disagreed\nover heuristics and engaged in a polemic over the question of free\nwill. Erasmus took a skeptical position vis-\u00e0-vis\nLuther\u2019s assertions. Unlike the reformer, he did not believe in\nthe clarity of Scripture and used consensus and tradition as criteria\nto settle questions that did not allow a rational conclusion. Erasmus\nrarely ventured into doctrinal questions, however, favoring simple\nfaith and devotion over dialectics and scholastic speculation. The\ncirculation of Erasmus\u2019 works was temporarily curtailed when the\nCatholic Church put them on the Index of Forbidden Books, but his\nideas saw a revival during the Enlightenment when he was regarded as a\nforerunner of rationalism. His most famous work, The Praise of\nFolly, has remained in print to the present day, a distinction\nshared by few books from the 16th century.\n",
