    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nPorphyry was born in Tyre in Phoenicia (now in Lebanon), probably in\n234 C.E. His name was \u2018Malcus\u2019, \u2018king\u2019 in his\nnative tongue, hence he became \u2018Basileus\u2019\n(\u2018king\u2019) in Greek. He, however, calls himself Porphyry,\nwhich supposedly was a common name in Tyre, the city of purple, and is\ngenerally known under that name. Little is known with certainty about\nhis life, except what can be gleaned from his own account of\nPlotinus\u2019 life, The Life of Plotinus. There is an\naccount of his life in Eunapius\u2019 Lives of Philosophers and\nSophists but this account clearly depends on the The Life of\nPlotinus and has little reliable to add. Before he came to study\nwith Plotinus in Rome in 263 C.E. he studied with the Middle Platonist\nLonginus in Athens. In Rome he stayed for some five years and\nconverted to Plotinus\u2019 version of Platonism. On Plotinus\u2019\nadvice he left Rome for Sicily in order to recover from a bout of\ndepression in 268 C.E. He must have stayed there for some time, even\nbeyond Plotinus\u2019 death in 270 C.E. There are some untrustworthy\nreports about a school of Porphyry in Rome after Plotinus\u2019\ndeath. In reality we do not know anything with certainty about where\nhe lived in the latter half of his life. He may have been\nIamblichus\u2019 teacher. The evidence for this, however, is not\nbeyond dispute. It is clear, though, that Iamblichus was strongly\ninfluenced by Porphyry, even if he turned vehemently against him.\nTowards the end of his life (301 C.E.), Porphyry edited\nPlotinus\u2019 writings, the Enneads, dividing them into six\nbooks of nine treatises each, which he prefaced with his Life of\nPlotinus. The latter is the most reliable and the most\ninformative source about his life and attitudes. He married fairly\nlate an older wife, for whom one of his extant writings, the\nLetter to Marcella, is written.\n",
