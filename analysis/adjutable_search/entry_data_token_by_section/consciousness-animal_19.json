    "main_text": "Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness || Invertebrates\n6.6 Invertebrates\nThere are additional daunting challenges to addressing questions of\nconsciousness outside the vertebrate lineage, given the radical\ndifferences between vertebrates and invertebrates with respect to\nanatomy and physiology. The strategy of identifying homologous and\nfunctionally analogous structures and processes, which underlies the\nconfidence of researchers such as Cabanac (2009), Seth et al. (2005),\nMerker (2005), and Panksepp (2005) that consciousness is shared with\nother animals is much more difficult to apply (Seth et al. 2005).\n\nThe vertebrate lineage represents just one of approximately 34 known\nphyla \u2014 ancient lineages of animals characterized by differences\nin fundamental anatomical organization and the developmental processes\nthat generate it. Each of these phyla is derived from a relatively\nsimple state (i.e. few tissue types and a minimal central nervous\nsystem with limited sensory capacities). Hence, the invertebrates such\nas cephalopod mollusks (e.g., octopi and squids) and arthropods\n(e.g. crustaceans, insects and spiders), that are complex enough to\nattract the attention of those interested in animal consciousness,\nevolved their complexity independently from vertebrates, and in the\ncase of cephalopods and arthropods, independently from each other.\n\n\nToday, only three of the phyla (vertebrates, arthropods, and mollusks)\ninclude animals with complex active bodies (Trestman 2013a),\ncharacterized by:\n\narticulated and differentiated appendages;\nmany degrees of freedom of controlled motion; \ndistal senses (e.g., \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 eyes); \nanatomical capability for active, distal-sense-guided mobility\n(fins, legs, jet propulsion, etc.); \nanatomical capability for active object manipulation (e.g.,\nchelipeds, hands, tentacles, mouth-parts with fine-motor\ncontrol).\n\nTrestman (2013a) argues that the evolution of complex active bodies\nrequires a capacity for integrated, embodied spatial cognition, and\nthat this capacity evolved independently in each of the three phyla in\nwhich it is currently found (vertebrates, arthropods and mollusks). If\nMerker (2005) is right that consciousness represents a solution to the\nneural-logistics problems posed by controlling a complex body in\nspace, it may be a good bet that these three lineages are likely\nsuspects for possessing consciousness. This line of reasoning can be\nbolstered by considering the role of temporal integration of\nperceptual information in consciousness and in action-selection and\nobject-oriented perception (Trestman 2013b). Perhaps each of these\nthree lineages evolved consciousness independently during the\ntransition from a relatively simple worm-like body morphology to\nhaving complex active bodies.\n One group of invertebrate animals that has received attention in\nthe context of questions about consciousness is the coleoid\ncephalopods \u2014 octopuses, squids and cuttlefish. These are\nlarge-brained, notoriously clever animals, well-known for their\nremarkable abilities to camouflage th emselves, and for their flexible\nhunting strategies. Mather (2008) argues that cephalopods exhibit many\nbehavioral indicators of consciousness, including complex learning and\nspatial memory, as well as apparent play. Both Merker (2005) and Edelman et\nal. (2005, 2009) argue that a strong provisional case can be made for\nconsciousness in cephalopods \u2014 although these authors emphasize\nthe limitations on our understanding posed by the differences in\nanatomy and physiology between cephalopods and vertebrates.\n\nThe other phylum that has received particular attention is the\narthropods, which includes insects, crustaceans, spiders, and many\nother less familiar animals. This is an ancient and tremendously\ndiverse group of animals, so any generalizations should be made with\ncaution. Arthropods were among the earliest animals to evolve complex\nactive bodies \u2014 and correlatively to evolve brains capable of\nadaptively controlling complex adaptive bodies (Trestman 2013a), and\nso if the function of consciousness is to solve problems raised by the\ncontrol of complex active bodies (cf. Merker 2005), it may have\nevolved early on in the arthropod lineage, in a common ancestor of all\nliving arthropods.\n\n Few studies have aimed directly at answering questions about\nconsciousness in arthropods, but relevant empirical work includes:\n\nWork by Elwood and Appel (2009) that seems to show that hermit\ncrabs remember an aversive event (an electric shock), and can use that\nmemory in later context-sensitive decision-making. This seems to\nsatisfy Cabanac and Cabanac\u2019s (2009) definition of \u2018motivational\ntrade-off\u2019 behavior, which those authors argue is an indicator\nof consciousness.\n Work by Jackson and colleagues (reviewed in Jackson and Wilcox\n1998) documenting a variety of impressive behaviors in in jumping\nspiders, including:\n\n  \n detouring and other forms of apparent planning (noted as a\n  potential indicator of consciousness by Cabanac et al., 2009)\n flexible, context-sensitive adjustment of predatory behavior to prey behavior \n deception and smokescreen tactics\n\n\n Studies on bees, revealing pattern recognition, concepts of\n\u2018same\u2019 and \u2018different\u2019, navigation,\ncommunication, and visual working memory (reviewed in Srinivasan\n2010), and on mood and cognitive bias (Mendl et al. 2011).  \n\nAnother possibility is that consciousness evolved even earlier in\nanimal history and is even more widely distributed among animals, and\nhence has a function that is even more fundamental to animal\nlife. Ginsburg & Jablonka (2007a,b) attribute a primitive form of\n\u201coverall sensation\u201d as a by-product of even the simplest\nnerve nets in animals. They argue that as these states became\nharnessed to learning and motivation that they acquired the functional\nproperties of \u201cbasic consciousness\u201d.  If this is right,\nthan consciousness may have arisen not independently in arthropods,\nmollusks and vertebrates, but only once in the common ancestor of\nthese ancient groups, very early in animal evolution.\n\n",
