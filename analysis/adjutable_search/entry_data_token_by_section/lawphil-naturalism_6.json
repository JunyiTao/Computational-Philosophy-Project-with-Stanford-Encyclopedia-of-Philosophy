    "main_text": "Substantive Naturalism || Legal Positivism\n5.2 Legal Positivism\n\nAt least in contemporary Anglo-American legal philosophy, \u201cLegal\nPositivism\u201d is generally used as a shorthand for a claim roughly\nalong the following lines: \u201cthe existence and content of law\ndepends on social facts and not on its merits\u201d (Green 2009).\nWhat is the relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism in\nthe above-specified sense? The situation is somewhat complex because\nsome but not all Legal Positivists are naturalists, and few have gone\nso far as the Scandinavian Realists in wearing their naturalism on\ntheir sleeves. In brief, however, naturalism can and sometimes\nhas\u2014but need not\u2014play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism.\n\nHow is it that naturalism can play a role in motivating Legal\nPositivism? As has often been remarked, the core Positivist claim\nabout the relationship between law and social facts amounts in effect\nto a claim that law is reducible to social facts, which\u2014given\nthat \u201csocial facts\u201d here is, tacitly if not expressly,\nlimited to psychological and sociological facts\u2014further amounts\nto the claim that law is reducible to naturalistic facts. It should be\nclear enough why this would be appealing to people with S-naturalist\ncommitments, for it would, so to speak, mean that we can\n\u201cplace\u201d law in the realm of naturalistic facts and\nentities. (By analogy, consider why S-naturalists would be drawn to\nthe idea that the existence and contents of human minds\ndepends solely on facts about human brains.) Unsurprisingly,\ntherefore, the affinities between Legal Positivism and S-naturalism\nhave not gone unnoticed. (See Kar 2006, p. 931; Leiter 2018, pp.\n19\u201320.)\n\nIt is, however, somewhat harder to discern the actual extent to which\nS-naturalism has been a motivation for major philosophers in the Legal\nPositivist tradition. There is at least a good case to be made that\nHart was sufficiently attracted to S-naturalism to consider it an\nadvantage of Legal Positivism that it placed law in the world of\nearthly facts. (See Hart 1961, pp. 11\u201312, 83\u201384, 186; Raz\n1998, pp. 4\u20135; Toh 2005, pp. 83\u201385.) Even so, Legal\nPositivism need not be, and is not always, motivated by S-naturalism,\nor for that matter any kind of naturalism, and not all Legal\nPositivists are naturalists in any interesting sense. For example, Raz\ndoes not appear to be a naturalist of any sort. (See Raz 1988, p. 6.)\nThe broader point, of course, is that one need not be a naturalist to\nthink that some particular phenomenon (e.g., law) depends\nsolely on naturalistic facts.\n\nThus, it pays not to overstate, or to make overgeneralizations about,\nthe relationship between naturalism and Legal Positivism. We can,\nhowever, confidently say that Legal Positivism sits well with a\nbackground commitment to S-naturalism. This point is of no small\nimportance given the continuing influence of S-naturalism (or at least\ntemperamental affinities to S-naturalism) in the general background\nframework of post-Enlightenment culture and thought.
