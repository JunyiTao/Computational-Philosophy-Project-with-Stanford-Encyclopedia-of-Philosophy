    "main_text": "Principal Varieties in More Detail || Quasi-realism\n2.3 Quasi-realism\n\nSince non-cognitivism is a species of irrealism about ethics, it\nshould be unsurprising that many of its main motivations overlap with\nthose for other versions of ethical irrealism, especially with those\nfor error theories. Early non-cognitivists seem most concerned to\ndefend metaphysical and epistemic commitments incompatible with a\nrealist interpretation of moral claims. For example, moral judgments\nseem to be empirically under-determined (Ayer 1952, 106; Mackie 1977,\n39). Hence they fail tests for meaningful discourse proposed by\nlogical positivists. If moral language is meaningful, it would be a\ncounter-example to the view. Thus early versions of non-cognitivism\nwere proposed by these theorists, not so much because they were\ninterested in moral philosophy but rather to render innocuous a\nseeming counter-example to their own theories (Carnap 1937,\n24\u201327; Ayer 1952, 107\u2013109).\n\nMore contemporary non-cognitivists have also been motivated by similar\nunderlying metaphysical and epistemic commitments. But they have been\nas concerned with vindicating the legitimacy of moral practice and\nargument as with anything else. As a result, they have put more time\nand energy into explaining, and in a certain sense justifying, the\nrealist-seeming features of moral discourse in the absence of a\ncommitment to realism (Hare 1952; Blackburn 1984, 1998; Gibbard\n1990).\n\n\u2018Quasi-Realism\u2019 is Simon Blackburn\u2019s name for this\nsort of non-cognitivism, and especially his own version of\nexpressivism. Yet other sophisticated non-cognitivists, notably Allan\nGibbard, have been happy to work under the quasi-realist banner\n(Gibbard 2003, 18\u201319). What especially distinguishes the\nquasi-realist project is an emphasis on explaining why we are entitled\nto act as if moral judgments are genuinely truth-apt even while\nstrictly speaking they are neither true nor false in any robust sense.\nThus it is a commitment of a quasi-realist that normative judgments\nare in an important way different from most (other) paradigm\ndescriptive judgments \u2013 enough so to render problematic their\nstatus as either true or false \u2013 and yet that a justification is\nnonetheless available for our practices of treating them as if they\nwere in fact so. What exactly this comes to is hard to say without\ndiscussing some of the special problems for non-cognitivism in\ngeneral, since it is precisely in offering solutions to those problems\nthat the quasi-realist carries out his program. Thus we will revisit\nthe position later on in the context of these problems.\n",
