    "main_text": "Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes || Democratic Pluralism\n3.5 Democratic Pluralism\n\nDemocracy was a core concept for many early feminist pragmatists,\nespecially Jane Addams and Mary Parker Follett. For example, democracy\nas an ethic provided the theoretical framing for Addams\u2019\nbeginning work at Hull House as well as her later work with labor\nunions and feminist activism. In Democracy and Social Ethics\n(1902) Addams theorized a continually evolving democracy based on\nsocial association, particular to each generation and locality. As an\nethical system, it placed on each person \u201ca moral\nobligation\u201d to chose experiences of \u201cmixing on the\nthronged and common road\u201d where we can \u201cleast see the size\nof one another\u2019s burdens\u201d (1902 [2002]: 8\u20137). She\ncritiqued earlier formations of liberty and democracy that\nweren\u2019t developed out of experience and interaction, and that\ndidn\u2019t embrace all classes of society. Addams took this sense of\nempathic understanding to larger and larger communities, as she moved\nfrom local to national to international work. Democracy, for Addams,\nis built upon dialogue, joint experiences and social equality. She\nunderstood we must give up on the hope that we will \u201csettle our\nperplexities by mere good fighting\u201d, suggesting this stance\nemerged from a \u201cchildish conception of life\u201d (1910 [1990]:\n57). Her nephew, James Weber Linn, wrote that Addams\u2019 distrusted\nlegislation when it was not \u201cpreceded by full discussion and\nunderstanding\u201d (155).  Addams\u2019 commitment to dialogic and\nrelational democracy emerged from the recognition that \u201cgenuine\nsocial reform\u201d across ideological differences tends to happen\nthrough \u201cslow, plodding dullness\u201d (Fischer 2016: 5).\n\nAs a political philosopher, Mary\nParker Follett wanted to move the practice of democracy away from the\nmere action of voting to small community based decision-making. She\nbelieved that problem-solving via dialogue and action in local but\ndiverse networks and organizations was the best basis for democracy.\nRejecting compromise as a way of dealing with difference, she instead\nadvocated for \u201cintegration\u201d, believing conceptual\nresolution of differences must be worked out in everyday action\ntogether. According to Follett, the process of resolution requires\nfull honesty, self-knowledge, careful listening and understanding of\nwhat is symbolized in the others\u2019 demands.\n\nA pluralistic community is an important theoretical and practical\ncomponent of pragmatist conceptions of democracy. The \u201csocial\nethics\u201d advocated by Dewey and Addams embraces equality and\nmultiplicity, narrative and perplexity, fellowship and cooperative\naction, sympathetic understanding and the expansion of our ethical\nframework. Scott Pratt has noted that these pluralistic values in\nAmerican philosophy may have deeper roots than James, Dewey and\nAddams. For example, in Native Pragmatism Pratt traces the\ngender and cultural pluralistic values of American philosophy to the\nearly 19th century writings of Lydia Marie Child on\nindigenous North Americans.\n\nIn fact, Addams, Dewey, and Follett all critiqued the ideal of liberal\nindividualism which positions individuals as autonomous beings in\ncompetition with each other for their freedoms. Instead pragmatist\nfeminists focus on living in a reciprocal and interdependent social\nenvironment, believing this holds the promise of civilization,\ncooperation, and coexistence; they work to build communities that\nfoster these joint associations. By prioritizing community,\npragmatist-feminists encourage us to rethink what it means to live in\na democracy (Green 1999), to provide a feminist communitarian\nphilosophy (Whipps 2004), or to re-conceive alternative ways of\nstructuring societies (Boggs and Kurashigo 2012). Early pragmatist\nwriters join with contemporary feminists in a critique of the\nhierarchical systems of power that limit diverse perspectives. Several\ncontemporary pragmatist-feminists have built upon these foundations to\ndevelop pragmatist-feminist political philosophies, including Judith\nGreene in Deep Democracy: Community, Diversity,\nTransformation (1990), Beth Singer in Pragmatism, Rights and\nDemocracy (1999), and Erin\nMcKenna in The Task of Utopia (2001). These feminist\npragmatists imagine a participatory democracy in which all members of\nthe society are involved in creating the community. Yet many\ncontemporary feminists criticize recent communitarian philosophies as\npotentially harmful to feminist issues; they argue the call for a\n\u201creturn\u201d to community values means a return to values that\nrestrict gender roles or limit diversity. With this critique in mind,\nAddams can be seen as a basis for a feminist progressive\ncommunitarianism that critiques isolated individualism and\nunderstands personal identity as necessarily embedded in social and\npolitical community. While pragmatists and feminists share the concern\nfor relational community and pluralistic thinking, they differ in how\nthey construct the Other. Pragmatists, Seigfried says, \n\n\nare more likely to emphasize that everyone is a significantly and\nvaluably Other \u2026 and tend to celebrate otherness by seeking out\nand welcoming difference as an expression of creative subjectivity.\n(Seigfried 1996: 267) \n\n\nAs Francis Hackett, an early resident of Hull House, said about\nAddams, \u201cone feels in her presence that to be an\n\u2018other\u2019 is itself a title to her recognition\u201d (1969:\n76). Feminists, on the other hand, having experienced the position of\nmarginalized otherness as women, are more inclined to \u201cexpose\nthe controlling force exercised by those who have the power to\nconstruct the Other as a subject of domination\u201d (Seigfried 1996:\n267).\n\nShannon Sullivan, in Revealing Whiteness (2006), notes that\nAddams was \u201cahead of her time\u201d in her theoretical and\npractical focus on reciprocal class and race relations, yet cautions\nthat such reciprocal relations have also \u201cunintentionally\nfurthered white people\u2019s ontological expansiveness\u201d (2006:\n168). Sullivan draws on Dewey\u2019s and James\u2019 writing on\nhabit, as well as psychoanalytic theory, to call for responsibility\nfor one\u2019s unconscious attitudes. In either embracing the\ndiversity of the other, or in critiquing a system that makes persons\ninto object-others, both feminism and pragmatism provide theoretical\ntools to analyze and actively fight against the unjust hierarchies\ncreated by racism, classism, and sexism. Contemporary black feminist\npragmatists such as V. Denise James are building on the work of Anna\nJulia Cooper, Ida B. Wells and others, to develop black feminist\nvisionary pragmatism, a term which describes \u201cacademic, cultural, and\nactivist projects that attempt to take a practical view of social\namelioration, while positing a vision of a radically changed, more\njust society\u201d (James 2013).\n",
