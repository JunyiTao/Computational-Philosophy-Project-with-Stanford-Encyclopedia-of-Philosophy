    "main_text": "Shifting Interpretations\n2. Shifting Interpretations\n\nThe first thing to notice about this is that the identification of\nsupreme emergency and dirty hands represents a dramatic shift from\nWalzer\u2019s view in his original article, and this shift reflects a\nsignificant ambiguity in the dirty hands tradition. Walzer\u2019s\naccounts of supreme emergency vary somewhat in the treatments in\nJust and Unjust Wars and in the later article,\n\u201cEmergency Ethics\u201d (and we shall attend to this later) but\nin both accounts the necessity to override deep moral constraints only\narises in conditions approaching catastrophe. In the original 1973\npaper, however, the trigger for dirty hands is nowhere near as\nextreme. One example there, with intriguing contemporary relevance,\nconcerned a political leader\u2019s need to torture a suspected\nterrorist in the hope of preventing the likely killing of hundreds of\ninnocent people. This falls well short of the criterion of supreme\nemergency in Walzer\u2019s later writings where the trigger is the\ndevastation of whole peoples and/or their ways of life. Moreover,\nWalzer\u2019s other example in the original paper was of a good\ndemocratic politician bribing a corrupt ward boss to deliver him votes\nwith the promise of improperly delivered school construction\ncontracts. Here not only is the moral violation much less profound\nthan in the former case, but the emergency could hardly be considered\n\u201csupreme\u201d in any sense even if we allow that the votes are\nneeded to win an important election and that the politician is\ngenuinely motivated to do good when elected. In Walzer\u2019s initial\ntreatment, there is also some ambiguity in the use of the term\n\u201cdirty hands\u201d since he sometimes uses it for any\nconspicuous immorality as well as the more interesting and technical\nsense we are concerned with. So he says \u201cIt is easy to get\none\u2019s hands dirty in politics and it is often right to do\nso\u201d (Walzer 1973, 174). The first clause seems to point to the\nwidespread temptation to resort to immorality where the second\nindicates that it isn\u2019t always right to do so, hence demarcating\na positive normative sense of \u201cdirty\u201d from a merely\ndescriptive sense. The use of \u201coften\u201d shows the more\nconcessive attitude to the scope of dirty hands in contrast to\nWalzer\u2019s later view.\n\nEarlier writers concerned with the need for politicians to dirty their\nhands with immoral behaviour show some of this vacillation, sometimes\nstressing the extreme stakes that are involved, but more often\nappearing to view the political process generally as above morality,\nor at least operating with a different morality. (\u201cOne cannot\nmeasure such men by the ordinary rule\u201d). John M. Parrish in an\ninteresting and far-ranging book (Parrish, 2007) shows that there are\nelements of the concern about the generally challenging nature of\npolitics for morality as early as Plato\u2019s Republic.\nParrish\u2019s understanding, however, of what constitutes dirty\nhands is often so broad as to obscure some of the distinctions,\nambiguities and problems arising from current philosophical\ndiscussions. to be fair, he is interested in charting a sort of\npre-history to the contemporary debate, and admits that \u201cthe\nproblem may have changed over time\u201d so that there is \u201ca\nsuccession of dirty hands problems\u201d (Parrish, p. 18). Even so,\nsome of the apparently morally troubling examples he discusses from\nancient intellectual sources have none of the marks of the\ncontemporary problem. Augustine\u2019s insistence, for example, that\neven a justly waged war is morally regrettable is accompanied by the\nuntroubled argument that the warrior whose cause and intention is just\ndoes not sin at all (i.e., violate any moral obligation) in killing\nhis enemy. Parrish\u2019 emphasis on the idea that political life is\npervasively morally problematic, however, does find echoes in early\nmodern treatments that foreshadow the contemporary dirty hands\ndiscussion. One such influential treatment is that of Machiavelli. So\nMachiavelli thinks that the ordinary processes of politics require\nthat the Prince \u201cmust learn how not to be good\u201d, though he\nshould maintain the appearance of virtue and indeed behave virtuously\nwhen the cost is low (Machiavelli 1513, 52). Max Weber stresses the\nway that regard for consequences must dominate the thinking of the\npolitician as contrasted with ordinary or religiously inspired ethics.\nThis contrast lies behind the opposition Weber discerns in\n\u201cPolitics as Vocation\u201d between \u201can ethic of\nresponsibility\u201d and \u201can ethic of ultimate ends\u201d.\nAlthough the terms in which Weber frames the contrast tend to confuse\nrather than clarify the issues, it is probable that one thing he has\nin mind for the \u201cultimate ends\u201d side of the conflict is an\nethic involving absolute prohibitions; he sees these as being in\ntension with an outlook geared to counting consequences. As Weber puts\nit: \u201cthere is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows\nthe maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends-that is, in religious terms,\n\u2018the Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the\nLord\u2019-and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of\nresponsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the\nforeseeable results of one\u2019s action\u201d (Weber 1919, 120).\nThe starkness of this contrast is one source of confusion since, as we\nshall see later, absolutists are not totally indifferent to\nconsequences \u2014 not all their ethic consists of absolute\nprohibitions-and non-absolutists need not be obsessed only with\nconsequences. But Weber is adamant that it is impossible in politics\nto adhere generally to any absolutist ethic of ultimate ends, largely\nbecause of what he sees as the central role of violence in politics.\nIn spite of Walzer citing him approvingly (up to a point) in his\noriginal article, Weber does not seem to hold anything like\nWalzer\u2019s mature view. He does not think that an ethic of\nultimate ends suffices most of the time, but gives way in conditions\nof supreme emergency; rather his view appears to be that the ultimate\nends ethic is quite generally inadequate to politics. In fact,\nWeber\u2019s belief that violence is central to the operation of\npolitics is exaggerated, though understandable in the circumstances in\nwhich he wrote, but if it were true it might give his position more\naffinity with Walzer\u2019s idea of supreme emergency. The difference\nwould remain that, although violence may well be a factor in\nestablishing supreme emergency, Walzer\u2019s mature understanding of\nsupreme emergency requires more than simply incursions of\nviolence.\n\nThis ambiguity about the extent of the need for dirty hands is\nreflected in much of the literature on the topic. Numerous writers\nhave followed early Walzer (and some elements in both\nMachiavelli\u2019s and Weber\u2019s treatment of political morality)\nin regarding politics as a zone in which, to quote Neil Levy,\n\u201cdirty actions are part and parcel of ordinary political\nlife\u201d. Levy adds: \u201cPoliticians must make deals, compromise\nwith interests they abhor, distribute favours and neglect\nrelationships\u201d (Levy 2007, 52\u20133, endnote 26). A number of\nthese things are no doubt regrettable or distasteful in varying\ndegrees, but whether they are immoral depends on what the deals are,\nwhat the favours involve, how deep the compromise runs, and how\ndamaging the neglect is (and to what sort of relationship). Much of\nwhat various writers regard as the need for dirty hands in politics is\ndubiously an issue of immorality at all. In order to maintain power\nand get important work done, a politician may have to appoint a member\nof a party in coalition with his own to an important Ministry ahead of\na trusted colleague in his own party who has better credentials for\nthe job. This is disappointing and painful to him and his colleague\nand clearly less than ideal (even though the appointee is, we may\nsuppose, competent enough) but I do not think the act can be seen as\nimmoral. To call it morally disagreeable is to signal the fact that\ncertain valuable relations and ends are put under strain by it, but it\nis clearly not is the same league as torture, murder, or gross\ndeceit.\n\nBernard Williams does indeed distinguish levels of gravity in the\nsinning required of politicians in his exploration of the scope of\ndirty hands, but he also suggests that the politician\u2019s\nnecessary immoralities are very common and distinctive. He\ndistinguishes between the morally \u201cdisagreeable or\ndistasteful\u201d and the morally criminal, the latter being subsumed\nunder a broad category of what he calls \u201cviolence\u201d\n(Williams 1978, 71). Although Williams allows that some political\nactions that are popularly believed to be morally dubious, may well be\nmorally acceptable when circumstances are properly understood, he\ncasts a pretty wide net for the morally disagreeable. It involves such\nthings as \u201clying, or at least concealment and the making of\nmisleading statements; breaking promises; special pleading; temporary\ncoalition with the distasteful; sacrifice of the interests of worthy\npersons to those of unworthy persons; and (at least if in a\nsufficiently important position) coercion up to blackmail\u201d\n(Williams 1978, 59). Yet it is unlikely that all of these, as so\ngenerally described, are morally wrong in all circumstances. True,\nsome philosophers have held as much for some of these\u2014Augustine,\nAquinas and Kant for lying, and Kant for promising\u2014but surely\nlying is acceptable in extreme circumstances such as the need to\nprotect an innocent person from a murderer, and even coercion\n(depending on the definition) isn\u2019t always morally wrong,\nwitness the coercive detention of people reasonably suspected of\ncontagious disease that they are unaware of. It seems that most, if\nnot all the things Williams mentions are in the category\n\u201cnormally morally wrong but morally permissible in certain\ncircumstances\u201d. Even blackmail might be in this category since\nblackmailing a vicious criminal in order to secure the freedom of his\nvictim might (perhaps depending on the kind of blackmail) be morally\npermissible. Notions like regret or remorse are sometimes invoked to\nshow that what had to be done was nonetheless immoral, but apart from\nthe fact that an act such as the blackmail of a vicious criminal need\nnot even be regrettable, there are many things one can rightly regret\nhaving to do that are not immoral, for example, punishing a child by\nwithdrawing privileges. Remorse strikes a stronger, more moralised\nnote, but for that very reason one should be careful not to confuse it\nwith various feelings of discomfort, regret or sorrow for having to do\ncertain things. Further investigation of the nature and appropriate\nconditions for remorse is interesting and difficult, but beyond the\nscope of this discussion, and its role as a criterion of dirty hands\nseems at best inconclusive.\n\nThe idea that dirty hands (in contrast to sheer bad behaviour and\ncorrupt activity) are commonplace in politics is highly dubious, but\njust how extensive the reach of this phenomenon is in politics is\ndifficult to determine, and would be best considered on a case by\ncase, or perhaps category by category, fashion. Clearly, the most\nobvious, and I think the most interesting category is that described\nby Williams with the term \u201cviolence\u201d (though that has the\ncontentious, and I think unfortunate implication that all violence is\nimmoral). This covers the acts that Walzer\u2019s later argument\nseeks to capture with his term \u201csupreme emergency\u201d. His\nterminology and his later practice make the scope of dirty hands\npretty restricted, perhaps more so than Williams intended, but I will\nfollow his example and focus on really grave injustices like murder,\ntorture, rape or slavery that are said to be warranted in conditions\nof extreme emergency.\n\nFirst, however, it is worth noting that enthusiasm to detect the sway\nof dirty hands can lead to misdescription of some complex, disturbing\nmoral situations. An interesting example of this has been explored by\nJennifer Rubenstein in connection with problems facing International\nNGOs providing aid in emergency situations such as the refugee camps\nin the Congo. INGO agents have found that their provision of food and\nmedicine is often exploited by warring factions within refugee camps\nand elsewhere (see also some of Fiona Terry\u2019s discussion and\nexamples in Terry 2002). This confronts them with often agonising\ndecisions about whether to cease aid and leave the areas of distress\nbecause of the harm this exploitation generates, including\ncontinuation of violent conflict. If they leave they abandon suffering\npeople, but if they stay, then they contribute unintentionally to\ngreat harms that others inflict on innocent people. Such problems are\noften described with the vocabulary of \u201cdirty hands\u201d, but,\nas Rubenstein argues, this description is misplaced since, for one\nthing, the aid agencies do not themselves intentionally do harm to\navoid some great evil or achieve some great good. Rubenstein proposes\na category of \u201cspattered hands\u201d to describe these\nsituations in order to emphasise that the soiling is contributed by\nthe actions of others (Rubenstein 2014, Chapter 4). We cannot examine\nthe adequacy of her new category here, but she seems right that the\nexamples are misdescribed as dirty hands.\n\nIt will be apparent from all this that the dirty hands problem needs\ninitially some conceptual clarification; this should proceed with a\nview to five issues. First, there is the question whether the dirty\nhands scenario makes any sense at all; perhaps it is just a muddle.\nSecond, there is the related question whether the overriding that\ndirty hands involve (or purport to involve) takes place within\nmorality or somehow beyond it. Third, there is the question whether\ndirty hands are necessitated only or primarily by politics. Fourth,\nhow are the circumstances that call for dirty hands best described?\nFifth, there is the issue of the relation of the dirty hands problem\nto that of moral dilemmas and the requirements of some form of moral\nabsolutism.\n",
