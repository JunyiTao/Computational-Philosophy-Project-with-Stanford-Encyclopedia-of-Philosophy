The accounts of weak\nemergence in the subsequent section are partly motivated as ways of\nmeeting one or both of the challenges.\n3.1.1 From parsimony\n\nThe simplest challenge to weak emergence is from parsimony, and it can\nbe pressed from the side of reductionism or anti-realism (e.g., Heil\n2003 and Ney 2010) or from the opposing side of strong emergentism\n(e.g., O\u2019Connor & Churchill 2010a,b). The weak emergentist\ngrants that the ontology and dynamical laws of a completed, true\nphysics metaphysically determine all fundamental physical facts,\nand that the latter metaphysically determine all\nnon-fundamental facts or associated truths about the world. In that\ncase, why add to the ontology of the world? Why not parsimoniously\nrest with the lower-level physical ontology, and offer a deflationary\naccount of truths that appear to refer to \u201chigher-level\u201d\nphenomena? One might, e.g., construe the phenomena as coarse-grained\npatterns running through the world of fundamental physical phenomena,\nand regard truths invoking concepts such as cell,\nmetabolism, cat, and desire as referring\n(perhaps schematically) to distinctive types of arrangements of\nunderlying physical entities and their qualities. This stance can\ngrant that in practice we cannot dispense with special scientific\nclaims. (The associated coarse-grained patterns are in some sense the\nstarting point of empirical inquiry for creatures like us, and even\nwere we to arrive at a true final physical theory, our cognitive\nlimitations would make it impossible for us to track the evolution of\nthe world in terms directly corresponding to such a fine-grained\nreality.) But (says the critic) such broadly pragmatic considerations\nshould not guide our views concerning the world\u2019s ontology;\nblocking such deflationary moves requires a stronger form of autonomy\nthan physicalism allows.\n3.1.2 From overdetermination (or \u201cexclusion\u201d)\n\nWeak emergence accepts the following five premises:\n\n Supervenient Dependence. Emergent features (properties,\nevents, or states) synchronically depend on their base features in\nthat, the occurrence of an emergent feature at a time requires and is\nnomologically necessitated by the occurrence of a base feature at that\ntime.\n Reality. Emergent features are real.\n Efficacy. Emergent features are causally\nefficacious.\n Distinctness. Emergent features are distinct from their\nbase features.\n Physical Causal Closure. Every lower-level physical\neffect has a purely lower-level physical cause.\n\n\nJaegwon Kim (in, e.g., his 1993 and 1998) argues that these premises\nentail an unacceptable conclusion:\n\n Overdetermination. Emergent effects are generally\ncausally overdetermined by distinct individually sufficient synchronic\ncauses (akin in every case to otherwise unusual and perhaps merely\npossible cases as when two rocks are thrown independently and strike a\ntarget at the same time).\n\n\nThe present presentation of Kim\u2019s argument follows Wilson 2015,\nwith some modifications (see also the discussion in Sturgeon 1998).\nEmergent effects might be same-level, downward, or both\n(Efficacy is neutral). Suppose, first, that emergent E\ncauses emergent E* (same level), while E superveniently\ndepends on P and E* superveniently depends on\nP* (Supervenient Dependence). P* has a purely\nlower-level physical cause (Physical Causal\nClosure)\u2014plausibly, P. If P causes P*,\nand P* necessitates E*, then it is plausible that\nP causes E*, by causing P*. So both P and\nE cause E*, and given that P and E are\nboth real and distinct (Reality, Distinctness),\nE* is causally overdetermined.\n\nSecond, suppose that E instead causes some lower-level base\nfeature P*. P* also has a purely lower-level cause\n(Physical Causal Closure)\u2014again, plausibly P. So\nboth P and E cause P*, and given that P\nand E are both real and distinct (Reality,\nDistinctness), P* is causally overdetermined.\n\nThus, whether we conceive emergent causation as same-level or\ndownward, the weak emergentist\u2019s commitments entail\noverdetermination (or as it is sometimes put, holding fixed\nnon-overdetermination, emergent causation is causally\nexcluded by the ubiquity of fundamental physical causes). Finding\nsuch systematic overdetermination to be implausible, Kim concludes\nthat we should reject Distinctness and embrace\nreductionism.\n\nRejecting other premises leads to alternative stances. Eliminativists\ndeny Realism, epiphenomenalists deny Efficacy, and\nsubstance dualists and some strong emergentists deny Supervenient\nDependence. Strong emergentists commonly deny Physical Causal\nClosure, maintaining that emergent features are non-redundant\ncausal contributors alongside lower-level physical factors to some\nlower-level physical effects. Weak emergentists instead point to the\nintimate relation they see between emergents and their bases in order\neither to show a way to resist the argument\u2019s overdetermination\nconclusion or to make plausible that emergent and basal physical\ncauses are non-competing in a way that renders\noverdetermination harmless.\n3.2 Contemporary accounts\n\nIn this section, three broad accounts of weak emergence are introduced\nand proposed variations noted.\n3.2.1 Token identity/type non-identity\n\nOne weak emergentist approach locates the distinctness and distinctive\nefficacy of emergents in feature or process types, while\nmaintaining that every token feature or process is identical with a\ntoken fundamental physical entity. This view in a sense \u201csplits\nthe difference\u201d with the reductionist, and so is the most\nminimalist of the weak emergent positions. One advantage of the view\nis that it provides a basis for resisting Kim\u2019s argument for\ncausal overdetermination. Causation is a token-token relation. If\ntoken higher- and lower-level entities are identical, then there is\nbut one token cause of a given effect, which seems to dismantle the\nchallenge. At the same time, the type-distinctness of weakly emergent\nand base features provides a basis for claiming distinctive efficacy\nthrough \u201ccausal relevance\u201d considerations. We may query\nthe cause of a token effect through the prism of distinct\neffect types, and which type we select will determine which\ncause type is relevant to its explanation.\n\nProponents of such accounts typically offer some specific account of\nthe relation at issue, aimed at rendering it plausible that the\nfeatures at issue might be type-but-not-token distinct. Cynthia and\nGraham Macdonald (1986, 1995) suggest that higher-level features are\ndeterminables of lower-level physical features and determinable types\nare reducible to disjunctions of determinate types. Given this\ncombination of views, higher-level determinable features are\ntype-distinct from associated lower-level determinate features (since\na disjunctive type is not identical to any one disjunct type), but\nevery instance of a higher-level determinable feature is\ntoken-identical with some lower-level determinate feature (since\ninstances of disjunctive types are token-identical with instances of\nsome or other disjunct type). Some critics object that higher-level\nfeatures are not appropriately modeled as determinables of lower-level\nphysical determinates (Ehring 1996), or that determinables cannot be\nreductively analyzed in terms of determinates (Wilson 2012).\n\nRobb (1997) and Ehring (1996) offer token identity accounts on which features of things\nare \u201ctropes\u201d (particularized properties, such as the\nalleged particular whiteness of a given sheet of paper) and properties\nper se are sets or collections of tropes (see\n entry on tropes).\n We may suppose that every higher-level trope is identical with a\nlower-level physical trope, notwithstanding that the one trope is a\nmember (or part) of different property-identifying sets of tropes, and\nhence of different types. Here again, the suggestion is that such a\nview avoids overdetermination while preserving a role for the\ndistinctive efficacy/causal relevance of higher-level features.\n3.2.2 Realization\n\nPerhaps the most common approach to weak emergence is one appealing to\none or other account of \u201crealization\u201d. (Recall the point\nmade in\n section 2.1.2\n that realization falls under the more general concept of grounding\nthat is deployed more frequently in some other contexts.) The first\naccounts of realization were in functionalist terms, according to\nwhich a realized feature is characterized by a distinctive causal or\nfunctional role, which role is implemented, on any given occasion, by\nsome or other lower-level physical feature. Hence, Putnam (1967)\nsuggests that, just as a software program might be implemented on\nmultiple hardware platforms, so mental states might be associated with\ncausal-functional roles which are played by multiple neurological, and\nultimately fundamental physical, states. Such an approach accommodates\nthe ontological autonomy of weak emergents to the extent that a\nfunctionally associated type is not identified with any one of its\nrealizer types. It would also appear to provide a basis for blocking\nconcerns about causal overdetermination by analogy again to software\nprograms, whose powers are inherited from their lower-level\nrealizers. Given such an inheritance thesis for higher-level powers,\neven if there is a sense in which both realized and realizing features\ncan cause a given effect, only one power is exercised, not\ntwo\u2014in which case, it is maintained, the overdetermination is\nbenign. (This functionalist perspective on special science entities\nand features was influentially developed by Fodor 1974.)\n\nOther approaches to realization appeal to other specific relations. As\nnoted above, one might endorse an account of weak emergence in terms\nof determination through the assumption that instances of\ndeterminables are token-identical to instances of their realizing\ndeterminates. But one might adopt this general approach while\nrejecting the assumption of token identity, either on grounds that\ndeterminable tokens as well as types have less specific essences than\nassociated determinate tokens and types (Yablo 1992) or on grounds\nthat determinable tokens as well as types are associated with fewer\npowers than associated determinate tokens and types (Wilson 1999,\n2015). Yet another approach to realization is based in the part-whole\nrelation, with higher-level types and tokens taken to be proper parts\nof lower-level types/tokens (Shoemaker 2000 [2001], Clapp 2001).\nCommon to these particular strategies is the idea that token and type\npowers of a realized feature are a (non-empty) proper subset of the\ntoken or type powers of the lower-level physical feature upon which it\ndepends (Wilson 1999, 2015). Causal autonomy can result from a\nhigher-level feature\u2019s having fewer, not more, powers than the\nfeature upon which it depends because the latter encodes distinctive\ndifference-making (e.g., if one\u2019s neurological state had been\nslightly different, one would still have been thirsty and still have\nreached for the glass).\n\nFinally, it has recently been proposed that a distinctive form of\nphysical realization comes through implementing mechanisms:\nenduring structures of organized components that realize higher-level\nrole functions, endowing higher level entities with novel,\nnon-aggregative behaviors and properties (see Machamer et al. 2000,\nCraver 2007, and\n entry on mechanisms in science).\n Craver (2007) argues that in neuroscience and psychology in\nparticular, we should think of minded biological agents as constituted\nby a hierarchy of mechanisms (or networks of such mechanisms). While\nhe avoids use of the term \u201cemergence\u201d, which he associates\nwith strong emergence (2007: 16), he is plausibly taken to advance a\ndistinctive form of weak emergence. He defends the reality of such\nhigh-level, fully-realized powers on the grounds that they satisfy the\nconditions for causal relevance on the (manipulationist) account of\ncausal explanation that he favors (2007: 216\u2013220). Haug (2010)\ndevelops a mechanistic account of realization incorporating a\ndistinction between what he calls \u201cconstitutive\u201d and\n\u201cintegrative\u201d mechanisms, associated with two distinct\nroles mechanisms play in the realization of special science\nproperties. He argues that his mechanistic account contrasts favorably\nwith determinable/determinate approaches (and more generally,\n\u201cproper subset of powers\u201d approaches) to realization, and\nthat it provides a principled basis for claims of multiple\nrealizability. (Gillett 2016 also emphasizes realizing mechanisms\nassociated with novel powers in his account of emergence. But as he\nrejects physical causal closure, his account will be discussed under\nthe rubric of strong emergence in\n section 4.)\n3.2.3 Explanatory \u201cincompressibility\u201d\n\nThe appeal to unpredictability or other epistemic criteria plays a\nsignificant role in accounts of weak emergence (going all the way back\nto Broad\u2019s [1925] highly influential discussion), even though\nthe intended contrast with \u201creductionism\u201d is ontological.\nIt is near the surface in the non-aggregativity account of emergent\nautonomy summarized in\n section 2.2.1\n above, in which the non-linearity of macro-system dynamics (resulting\nin practical unpredictability) is taken to be a hallmark of (weak)\nemergence. Bedau (1997, 2010) proposes that we build this distinctive\ndiscovery of modern complex systems research into our theoretical\nelucidation of emergence. Specifically, a feature of or process within\na macro-system is weakly emergent just in case it is derivable from\nthe prior micro-facts leading up to it, but only in an informationally\nincompressible way: describing its macro-state at prior times by\naggregating all of its underlying micro-states at those times and\niterating their micro-dynamics. When a system\u2019s macro-evolution\nis explanatorily incompressible in this way, it is not dynamically\ncharacterizable in fundamental physical terms: its distinctive\nevolutionary patterns are not foreshadowed in any way in the\nmicro-evolutionary patterns.\n\nIt is possible to see special cases, giving rise to distinct species\nof weak emergence, within the broad framework of non-linear dynamics.\nRueger (2000) and McGivern and Rueger (2010) suggest that a form of\ndiachronic (or evolutionary) emergence occurs when there is a sharp\nchange in the behavior of a single system\u2014behavior which is\n\u201cqualitatively novel\u201d with respect to its earlier\nbehavior\u2014as a result of a comparatively small perturbation in\none of its underlying control parameters. There are well-documented\ncases of such transitional changes in a system\u2019s behavior.\n4. Strong Emergence\n\nStrong emergentists maintain that at least some higher-level\nphenomena exhibit a weaker dependence/stronger autonomy than weak\nemergence permits. This often takes the form of rejecting physical\nrealization, affirming fundamental higher-level causal\npowers, or both.\n\nPerhaps the most commonly cited phenomena offered as requiring strong\nemergentist treatment have to do with the nature and capacities of the\nconscious mind in relation to its neural substrate. Other non-mental,\nscientific phenomena also have been advanced as possibly or plausibly\nrequiring treatment in strong emergentist terms. Such claims are\ncanvassed in\n section 5.\n4.1 Challenges to its viability\n\nThis section introduces three commonly pressed challenges to the\nin-principle viability of strong emergence. Possible replies are noted\nin connection with certain accounts of strong emergence introduced in\nthe subsequent section.\n4.1.1 Incoherence or inexplicability\n\nAn initial worry about strong emergence is that there is a tension in\nthe very idea of a feature that is both dependent and\nfundamental\u2014a worry exacerbated by recent accounts of\nfundamentality according to which what it is to be fundamental is\nprecisely to be independent (see Bennett 2017 and\n entry on fundamentality).\n\nThis worry might be resolved by distinguishing two senses of\n\u201cfundamental\u201d: first, a sense applying to an ingredient of\nphysical reality that is ubiquitous (or \u201cbasic\u201d in a\nbuilding-block sense), and so not even dependent on any arrangements\nof other entities; and second, a sense applying to an ingredient of\nreality that is not (entirely) constituted by or otherwise internally\n(as opposed to external-causally) related to the structured\narrangement of some other same-category entities. We might then use\nthe term \u201cbasic\u201d for the first sense and reserve\n\u201cfundamental\u201d for the second sense, which aligns the\nlatter term with the way it is used in contemporary discussions of\n\u201cgrounding\u201d or metaphysical dependence in metaphysics. So\nunderstood, there is no tension in the notion of an entity or feature\nthat is fundamental but non-basic (O\u2019Connor 2018).\n\nGranting that there is no incoherence in the idea of a non-basic,\nfundamental entity or feature, one might be concerned that such an\nentity or feature would introduce an inexplicable (since fundamental)\naddition to reality at an arbitrary juncture. Avoiding such\ninexplicability might give reason to prefer a panpsychist\naccommodation of the irreducibility of consciousness to physical\nproperties, as it (unlike strong emergence) posits proto-conscious\nqualitative character into the basic structure of the world\n(Nagel 1979 and Strawson 2006).\n4.1.2 Anti-naturalism or evidential paucity\n\nA second initial worry with strong emergence is that it is\ninconsistent with a \u201cnaturalist\u201d point of view, insofar as\n(on most accounts) strongly emergent properties are associated with\nfundamentally novel powers or laws that apparently would interfere\nwith more basic physical laws or processes. However, basic dynamical\nlaws in contemporary physics have an open-ended character\n(Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, Hamiltonians or Lagrangians more\ngenerally), taking forces or energies as input. The notion of a\nstrongly emergent force or energy is no more problematic than that of\nthe standard physical forces or energies that physicists take to be\ninput into the operative laws (McLaughlin 1992).\n\nThe real problem here, if there is one, is not inconsistency with\nphysics, but rather that there is at present a lack of clear empirical\nevidence for strong emergence. If there were strongly emergent causal\npowers, forces, or laws, we might expect to see, in candidate\nemergentist contexts, evidence for a hitherto unrecognized\nconfigurational interaction, much as occurred with the weak nuclear\ninteraction. But, McLaughlin avers, \u201cthere is not a scintilla of\nevidence\u201d in support of there being such fundamental novelty\n(1992: 91). For strong emergentist replies to this contention, see\n section 4.2.2\n and\n section 5.\n4.1.3 Collapse\n\nA final challenge to the viability of strong emergence is that such\naccounts are vacuous, in that any purportedly fundamentally novel\npower possessed by an emergent is, on any of a number of plausible\naccounts of powers, \u201calready\u201d possessed by its lower-level\nbase goings-on.\n\nOn one version of this \u201ccollapse\u201d objection, certain ways\nof individuating lower-level physical features entail that such\nfeatures will have dispositions to produce any purportedly strongly\nemergent features, undermining the supposed metaphysical novelty of\nthe emergent features in favor of an enriched understanding of the\nbase features (O\u2019Connor 1994: 98\u20139 and 2000: Ch.6,\nintroduces this objection; see Howell 2009 and Taylor 2015 for\ndevelopment). On another version of the objection, certain ways of\nassigning powers to features entail that lower-level physical features\nwill inherit any powers had by purportedly strongly emergent features\n(Kim 1998). For strong emergentist replies to the\n\u201ccollapse\u201d challenge, see\n section 4.2.2.\n4.2 Contemporary accounts\n\nI now discuss a representative range of contemporary accounts of this\nform of emergence.\n4.2.1 Formal characterizations\n\nA metaphysically minimalist characterization of strong emergence is\nsupervenience-based. In contrast to weakly emergent or physically\nreducible features, which are taken to supervene with metaphysical\nnecessity on their physical dependence base, strongly emergent\nfeatures are taken to supervene with merely nomological necessity (van\nCleve 1990, Chalmers 2006, Noordhof 2010).\n\nThis approach assumes that the conceptual distinction between\nnomological and metaphysical necessity corresponds to a substantial\none, such that fundamental causal laws are metaphysically contingent\nand what supervenes of metaphysical necessity on the fundamental\nphysical domain is necessarily physical. Both these assumptions have\nbeen challenged. Moral anti-naturalists such as G.E. Moore maintain\nthat fundamental moral features supervene of metaphysical necessity on\nnatural features, and on neo-Aristotelian essentialist ontologies,\nstrongly emergent features, were they to exist, would supervene with\nmetaphysical necessity on physical features. See, however, Howell\n(2009) and Noordhof (2010) for strategies aimed at defending\nsupervenience-based approaches to strong emergence.\n\nOne variant of this approach is epiphenomenalist (Jackson 1982, Kim\n2005, and Chalmers 1996 all express sympathy for this view). It\npresumes that the most plausible candidates for strong emergence are\nthe qualitative features of conscious experience\u2014e.g., the way\nthat the redness of a rose looks to a particular subject on a given\noccasion. On this approach, such \u201cqualia\u201d (qualitative\nfeatures) are caused or otherwise nomologically necessitated by the\nneural processes underlying human experience, but they are themselves\nincapable of producing any effects, including on any mental states\ngenerated by the purely physical aspect of the perceptual process.\n\nEpiphenomenal strongly emergent features are consistent with\nphysical causal closure. For this reason, the account is less\nvulnerable than standard accounts to the objection that it entails\npresently unsupported empirical predictions about brain processes. (It\nis still incompatible with physicalism, since strongly emergent qualia\nare not physically realized, and so are wholly additional to token\nlower-level physical phenomena.) A special challenge for the view is\nthat qualia would seem (paradoxically) explanatorily irrelevant to a\nsubject\u2019s beliefs concerning their existence (see Chalmers 1996:\nCh.5, for possible responses).\n\nOn a second formalist explication, strongly emergent phenomena are\nthose which are both fundamental and dependent, and where the notions\nof fundamentality (whose converse is the \u201cgrounded\u201d) and\ndependence are each taken to be primitive (Barnes 2012). Such a\nprimitivist account clearly blocks ontological reduction: if some\ngoings-on are fundamentally novel vis-\u00e0-vis the goings-on upon\nwhich they depend, then the former are clearly not identical to the\nlatter. A potential advantage of the approach is that it might capture\nthe common denominator to all other, more distinctive accounts of\nstrong emergence. A corresponding shortcoming is that its high level\nof abstraction leaves it without the resources of more specific\naccounts for addressing the general challenges facing strong emergence\nnoted above (Paolini Paoletti 2018 and Pearson 2018).\n4.2.2 Fundamental powers or laws\n\nAnother account of strongly emergent autonomy posits fundamentally new\npowers, forces, or laws directly associated with the emergent property\nof a complex object or system (O\u2019Connor 1994, Silberstein &\nMcGeever 1999, Wilson 2002, and O\u2019Connor & Wong 2005).\n\u201cFundamental\u201d here signifies that the power is not the\nresultant of any generalized kind of summation on the powers of the\nobject\u2019s constituents relative to the relational structure in\nwhich they are embedded. One variation on this basic account concerns\nthe way emergents depend on their bases. One common variant\nholds that emergent features are synchronically nomologically\nnecessitated by the base-level structure, where the necessitation,\nwhile law-governed, is not via causal production (Broad 1925,\nSilberstein & McGeever 1999, and Wilson 1999 and 2002). An\nalternative (naturally suited to a neo-Aristotelian causal powers\nmetaphysics) maintains that emergent features are diachronically\ncaused by a plurality of micro-properties acting jointly (perhaps\ntogether with other emergent features), under the triggering condition\nof the micro-properties\u2019 being appropriately structurally\norganized (O\u2019Connor & Wong 2005). This alternative can allow\nthat, even granting that causal necessity is a species of metaphysical\nnecessity, the supervenience of strongly emergent features on base\nphenomena will fail in (at least possible) scenarios in which the\ncausal dependence between either base and emergent features or\nemergent features and their effects is non-deterministic. That said,\nwhether supervenience does in fact fail for any actual cases of strong\nemergence is an empirical question (on which, see\n section 5.2).\n\nThe fundamental powers account of strong emergence is consistent with\na range of replies to the challenges noted in\n section 4.1.\n The first challenge asserts that strongly emergent features are\n\u201cinexplicable\u201d, insofar as they appear only in certain\norganized structures and could not be predicted in principle through\nthe laws of basic physics applied to emergent-antecedent conditions.\nOne reply is simply to observe that in the history of physics itself\nthere is precedent for adding new fundamental laws to explain what\npreviously recognized laws could not (e.g., electromagnetism and the\nweak nuclear force\u2014see Wilson 2002). When determining the\nfundamenta of the natural world, we must go where the evidence leads.\nAn alternative reply in line with the second variant of the previous\nparagraph denies the charge of inexplicability by supposing that\nemergent features are the product of micro-structural dispositions\nthat, unlike those which are more or less continuously manifested,\nhave structural triggering conditions. A Laplacian observer of the\nunfolding universe prior to the initial onset of such emergent\nfeatures would have no inkling of there being such latent dispositions\ntowards collective emergent effects. But they are as fundamental as\nthe more generally manifested dispositions associated with such\nproperties as mass and charge (O\u2019Connor & Wong 2005). And it\nmight be contended that while it is rational to presume that the\nnatural world is a causally unified totality, we cannot\npresume that it is causally uniform (O\u2019Connor 2000:\nCh.6).\n\nThe collapse challenge asserts that any purportedly strongly emergent\npowers would \u201ccollapse\u201d into\u2014that is, end up being\nassociated with\u2014their dependence bases. One might seek to block\ncollapse by distinguishing between collective dispositions for\nproducing certain powers and the powers themselves, or between direct\nand indirect having of powers; or by characterizing emergent powers as\nrelative to specified sets of fundamental interactions (see\nO\u2019Connor 1994: 98\u201399, and 2000, Ch.6, Wilson 2002, and\nBaysan & Wilson 2017). Two other reasons for resisting attempts to\ninterpret (possible) discontinuous microphysical behavior in terms of\nmicro-physical powers alone are epistemological. One might contend\nthat we should seek to provide as unified an explanation as possible\nof such phenomena, and that an explanation in micro-physical terms\nalone would be highly complex and disunified compared to one that\nposits a family of emergent macroscopic determinables fitted to\nstructures of organized complexity. Second, we can describe certain\npossible situations involving causal indeterminism that would be\nreadily understandable in strong emergentist terms, whereas the only\nmicrophysical explanation possible would require an objectionable\naction at a temporal distance. (See O\u2019Connor & Wong 2005 for\ndevelopment of these replies.)\n\nFinally, possible responses to the final, evidential challenge to\nstrong emergence are best considered in\n section 5,\n where a range of candidate emergent phenomena are introduced.\n4.2.3 Novel component powers in configured wholes\n\nNotwithstanding the replies just above to the collapse challenge, a\nrecent trend in theorizing about strong emergence has been to embrace\ncollapse, arguing that emergence is better understood as the\nintroduction of novel powers had by components when embedded\nin configured wholes. This section introduces four ways this account\nhas been developed.\n\nIn a series of articles culminating in a 2016 book, Carl Gillett\nadvances a distinctive account of strong emergence rooted in a\nhierarchy-of-mechanism picture of complex systems that, he maintains,\nis strongly supported by a range of sciences. Gillett invokes\nconsiderable conceptual machinery in developing his view; making\nsubstitutions in linked definitions, we arrive at the following\ncompact statement:\n\n\nA property is strongly emergent just in case it is a\nproperty of a composed individual that is realized and that (in\naddition to having same-level effects) non-productively determines the\nindividual\u2019s parts to have powers that they would not have given\nonly the laws/principles of composition manifested in simpler\ncollectives.\n\n\nThere are two distinctive features of Gillett\u2019s account. As\nnoted, the account ascribes fundamentally novel properties not to the\nbearer of the emergent property, but to the bearer\u2019s components.\nSecond, a realized structural property of the whole is nonetheless\nsaid to be the emergent property in virtue of its\n\u201cnonproductively determining\u201d the components\u2019 coming\nto have those novel powers. It is tempting to think of this last as\nalso ascribing a novel (albeit non-productive) power to the emergent\nproperty, although Gillett does not describe it in these terms. Note\nthat Gillett\u2019s account does not squarely fit the strong\nemergence classification given in this entry, insofar as he takes\nstrongly emergent properties to be \u201crealized by\u201d\nlower-level properties, when standing in a complex relation;\nnonetheless, the account properly belongs to the present strong\nemergent classification to the extent that it is inconsistent with the\ncausal closure of the microphysical realm.\n\nAs regards the general charge that strong emergence is inexplicable,\nGillett maintains that this account provides an intelligible,\nscientifically informed basis for making sense of strong emergence. As\nregards the charge of there being no evidence of strong emergence,\nGillett suggests that while its reality has not been established\nempirically, it is seriously proposed by a number of contemporary\ntheorists of complex systems (see\n section 5.2\n and\n section 5.3\n below).\n\nDavid Yates (2016, forthcoming) has proposed an account with some\nsimilarities to Gillett\u2019s. He discusses the way that the bent\ngeometry of a water molecule determines its dipole moment, which\nlatter feature confers a range of causal powers on the molecule, such\nas its disposition to align in an electric field and its being liquid\nat room temperature (2016: 822\u2013225). He argues that this\ngeometrical property, while fully realized by the spatial relations\nbetween the molecule\u2019s atoms, confers a new conditional\npower on the molecule that in tandem with the causal powers inherited\nfrom the molecule\u2019s basic constituents enables the molecule to\nproduce its characteristic effects. Key to Yates\u2019s proposal is\nthe suggestion that higher-level features may be\n\u201cqualitatively\u201d, as opposed to functionally, realized:\nwhile a functionally realized property is characterized in terms of\nderivative causal powers, qualitatively realized properties are\nnon-causally (e.g., spatiotemporally) characterized, making room for\nthem to be causally fundamental. As he puts it:\n\n\n[Q]ualitatively realized properties are defined by non-causal\nspecifications, and their realization is not a matter of bestowing the\nright causal powers. Properties such as molecular geometry are\ncausally fundamental [\u2026] because their bearers have certain\ncausal powers in virtue of meeting their defining specifications, but\nnot in virtue of the realizer properties in virtue of which\nthey meet those specifications on a given occasion. (2016: 812)\n\n\nYates contends that these examples demonstrate the reality of\nhis distinctive variety of strong emergence. A skeptic might press\nthat the effects Yates cites as pointing to a distinctive kind of\nhigher-level causal power are themselves all higher-level. Assuming\nthat all macroscopic properties are microphysically realized, if one\nwere able to take a wide-angle view of the evolving process in purely\nmicro-physical terms throughout (including in characterizing the\ntargeted token effects), it\u2019s not clear that reference to\nanything other than the features of and basic relations among\nmicrophysical entities is required for explanation. It might well be\nthe case that to explain the token effects under their\nmacroscopic description requires equally macroscopic appeal\nto molecular geometry (where a given geometric shape is multiple\nrealizable by distinct spatial arrays of atoms). But such explanatory\nirreducibility is, as we\u2019ve seen, the hallmark of forms of weak\nemergence.\n\nJonardon Ganeri (2011) also advances an account with affinities to\nGillett\u2019s. On this account, in virtue of entering into certain\nconfigurations, elements are \u201ctransformed\u201d in that they\nacquire new causal powers. He does not speak of \u201cnoncausal\ndownward determination\u201d from a configurational state to the\ncomponent powers, though the view seems materially equivalent to\nGillett\u2019s in this regard. The account differs, however, in\nmaintaining that in the evolving dynamic that follows the appearance\nof such new powers, there come to be emergent macro-states that\ntogether with the transformed micro-entities determine subsequent\nmicro- and macro-states. The resulting account is thus a hybrid of\nGillett\u2019s view and the more familiar novel causal power of the\nwhole view we saw in the previous section.\n\nSydney Shoemaker (2002, 2007), while agreeing with Gillett and Ganeri\nthat emergence occurs within special kinds of organized objects or\nsystems and features novel component powers, dispenses with any\ndownward determination relation, causal or otherwise. But these powers\nare novel in a qualified way:\n\n\nThe component entities have powers that, collectively, determine the\ninstantiation of the emergent property when they are combined in an\nemergence-engendering way. But these being cases of emergence, these\ncannot all be powers that manifest themselves when the components are\nnot combined in emergence-engendering ways. Some of them must be\n\u201clatent\u201d powers. Or, since these powers do not remain\nlatent when their possessors are combined in emergence-engendering\nways, let us speak of them as \u201cmicro-latent\u201d powers. We\ncan contrast these with the \u201cmicro-manifest\u201d powers which\nthese same entities manifest when they are not combined with other\nentities at all, or are configured in ways that are not\nemergence-engendering. (Shoemaker 2007: 73)\n\n\nThe thesis that newly manifest powers are \u201clatent\u201d will\nappeal to those who both take causal power to be a primitive feature\nof fundamental reality and see it as fundamental to all explanatory\nlinkages between earlier and later stages in the evolution of things.\n(We saw in the previous section that O\u2019Connor 1994 and\nO\u2019Connor & Wong 2005, who share these commitments, postulate\nthat emergent and fundamental macro-states are \u201cupwardly\u201d\ndetermined by micro-structural states manifesting latent dispositions\nof fundamental individuals to jointly cause such states when so\nconfigured.)\n4.2.4 Transformed elements independent of configured wholes\n\nFinally, several recent authors have proposed \u201ctransformational\nemergence\u201d accounts that severs the idea of a privileged class\nof hierarchically-organized wholes from the concept altogether. They\nadvance an ontological framework in which basic and structured\nindividuals undergo fundamental change, acquiring new powers that are\nnot \u201clatent\u201d (in the sense of there being an antecedent,\nontologically-grounded disposition for their subsequent appearance)\nand perhaps losing others. With the advent of new powers, there are\nnew laws describing their evolution.\n\nSantos (2015a,b) promotes such a view under the banner of\n\u201crelational ontology\u201d. The dynamic itself is constantly\nevolving, as elements are transformed through interactions with other\nelements. \n\n\n[W]hole is just a word that names the relational totality of\nthe individual relata and their relations, [which are] the\nonly real causal agents\u2026. (2015a: 28) \n\n\nSantos suggests that such a view of things is indicated by modern\ncellular and developmental biology, but the theoretical descriptions\nhe cites (e.g., 2015a: 30\u201332; 2015b: 439\u2013440) appear to be\nconsistent with the other metaphysical frameworks described in the\nprevious two sections. The issue of whether enduring\nstructured entities are essential or inessential to the broad\nframeworks embraced by the special sciences is a large issue that\ncannot be discussed here.\n\nHumphreys (2016), while not committing to the ubiquity of\n\u201ctransformational emergence\u201d, takes the account a step\nfurther away from those emphasizing structured wholes by making\ninteractions inessential: \n\n\nTransformational emergence occurs when an individual a that is\nconsidered to be a fundamental element of a domain D transforms\ninto a different kind of individual a*, often but not always as\na result of interactions with other elements of D\u2026They\npossess at least one novel property and are subject to different\nlaws\u2026. (2016: 60) \n\n\nAs an intuitive (though perhaps not realistic) example, he notes that\npeople undergo significant temporary psychological change when they\nare caught up in the interactions constituting a mob. His central\nrealistic example comes from the Standard Model of particle physics,\nwhich describes partless muons as very quickly \u201cdecaying\u201d\ninto electrons, electron neutrinos, and muon neutrinos (2016:\n66\u201367). Here there is fundamental change apart from any\ntriggering interactions, and not merely a change within individuals\nbut change of individuals from one kind to others. Humphreys\nfurther notes that his earlier \u201cfusion\u201d account of\nemergence (1997) is a special case of transformation. When fusion\noccurs, basal entities or certain of their properties are lost when\nthey fuse with others in producing a unified whole (2016: 74\u20135).\n(For accounts similar to Humphrey\u2019s, see Guay & Sartenaer\n2016 and Sartenaer 2018.)\n\nTransformational accounts clearly stretch the classical concept (which\ninforms the taxonomy of the present article). The common thread is\nsimply that of fundamental but lawlike change in the observable\npatterns in physical reality through time. For purposes of assessing\nhow competing accounts fare in characterizing the range of empirical\nphenomena uncovered in the sciences, it may be necessary for greater\nterminological regimentation to emerge.\n4.3 Strong emergence: from property to substance dualism?\n\nEmergentists of all varieties standardly are physical substance\nmonists about the natural world: all worldly (natural or artifactual)\nentities are composed or otherwise \u201cmade of\u201d entities that\nwould be described in a completed fundamental physics, whether\nphysical particles, fields, strings, or something else. This view is\ncommon enough among emergentists that some influential theorists took\nit to be a defining element of the doctrine. One might maintain,\nconsistent with substance monism, that wholes exhibiting strongly\nemergent, efficacious properties are fundamental, albeit composite\nobjects or systems, on the grounds that quantification over\nthem is required for a minimally adequate account of the world\u2019s\ndynamics. This might also give rise to an objective basis for identity\nthrough time, even for organisms undergoing constant change of parts\n(see O\u2019Connor & Jacobs 2003).\n\nBut one can argue that strong emergentism, at least with respect to\nsome or all mental states, in fact requires a form of substance\ndualism. On a biological view of emergent thinkers, the micro-physical\nboundaries of such thinkers may inevitably be vague, for empirical\nreasons. But it is perhaps doubtful that fundamental causal\nlaws associated with strongly emergent properties would reference\nvague conditions. The sole apparent alternative is that the properties\nare instantiated in a distinct, non-vague object instead, as a\nnon-physical mind would be. (See Zimmerman 2010 and Hasker 2016 and,\nfor a reply, O\u2019Connor 2016.)\n\nOne might also argue for an emergentist form of substance dualism as\nnecessary to account for (what many strong emergentists regarding\nconsciousness accept) there being unified subjects of conscious\nexperience (Nida-R\u00fcmelin 2007) or it being an objective matter\nwhether a conscious subject does or does not survive certain kinds of\nradical change (Swinburne 2013). Finally, many general accounts of the\ncategories of substance/object or physical substance/object in\nparticular entail that if an object has non-physical properties, it\nwill fail to count as a composed or physical substance (Francescotti\n2001, Schneider 2012, and O\u2019Connor 2018.)\n\nSupposing that strong emergence does bring a new substance in its\nwake, the spirit if not the letter of the usual emergentist commitment\nto substance monism is maintained by the weaker constraint that no\n\u201chigher-level\u201d substances or subjects \u201cfloat\nfree\u201d, actually or modally, from their dependence bases. It is\nfor just this reason that both Lowe (2008) and Nida-R\u00fcmelin\n(2007) characterize their substance dualism as\n\u201cnon-Cartesian\u201d.\n5. Weak vs. Strong Emergence: Contested Phenomena\n\nCertain phenomena and theoretical considerations motivating some\ncontemporary theorists to endorse a strong emergentist construal of\nthose phenomena. (It bears emphasis that strong emergentists typically\nalso suppose that some interesting organized behavior is more\nplausibly understood either reductively or as weakly emergent: their\nstrong emergentism is piecemeal.) This final section summarizes those\nphenomena and considers in general terms the different ways strong and\nweak emergentists might go about treating them.\n5.1 The conscious mind\n\nThe conscious mind in its different aspects has long seemed to many to\nresist plausible ontological characterization in any physical terms,\nwhether reductive or non-reductive (i.e., weak emergentist). (For a\nfairly comprehensive overview, see Chalmers 1996.)\n5.1.1 Conscious awareness and its unity\n\nConsider, for a start, our apparently direct awareness of our\nown conscious experiential states. (Conscious cognitive states such as\nbeliefs and desires have complicating aspects that cannot be explored\nhere. But see\n section 5.1.2\n immediately below for a possible linkage between the two germane to\nstrong emergentist conjecture.) The natural physicalist strategy for\ncharacterizing such awareness would be in terms of a distinctive form\nof informational flow among distinct physical states (the experiential\nstate itself and a distinct state of awareness of the experience); yet\nany such account would seem consistent with the possibility\nof a nonstandard causal source of the state of awareness of the\nconscious state, such that the subject is utterly mistaken about its\nobject, the subject\u2019s current conscious state. Such strong\nfallibilism about the contents of consciousness seems implausible, as\nis shown by the fact that philosophers such as Descartes who entertain\nradical skeptical doubts about much of human knowledge do not\ntypically extend it to our grasp of our current conscious experience.\nIs it, for example, conceivable that I am only seemingly (but\nmistakenly) aware of undergoing excruciating pain as of being laid out\non the torturer\u2019s rack, while in fact I am in a serene conscious\nstate as of lying on a warm sandy beach? It seems not, but it is hard\nto account for this datum in physicalist terms.\n\nAlso puzzling for physicalism is the unity of conscious\nexperience: the fact that our experiences engaging distinct sensory\nmodalities and our conscious thoughts, moods, and feelings come\ntogether as aspects of one overall conscious state of a single\nconscious subject. On a plausible physicalist account, each of these\naspects will be realized in distinct, physically-separated neural\nnetworks, but as yet there is no worked-out physicalist strategy for\ncapturing the unity of these aspects in experience.\n\nIn recent decades, highly general functional characterizations of\nconscious awareness have been proposed, notably: higher-order\ntheories, on which a state is conscious just in case it stands in the\nright kind of relationship to a higher-order state that represents it\n(Carruthers 2000; Rosenthal 2005;\n entry on higher-order theories of consciousness);\n global workspace theories, on which a state is conscious just in case\nits content is globally accessible to multiple cognitive subsystems\n(Baars 1997, Dehaene et al. 2006); and integrated information theory\n(Tononi & Koch 2015), on which a system is conscious just in case\nit carries more information than the sum of its parts (and is more\nconscious the greater the amount of such \u201cintegrated\u201d\ninformation). Anti-physicalists have argued that the first of these\ntheories implicitly denies or fails to adequately capture the two\nfeatures of direct awareness and unity; the second and third are\nhighly suggestive frameworks for theorizing about dynamical aspects of\nconsciousness, but insofar as they are developed in purely neural\nterms, they seem to provide only a weaker surrogate for what we\nintrospectively grasp concerning the unity of consciousness, and\ndon\u2019t speak clearly to the direct awareness relation.\n\nThat said, it is worth noting that these features, while present in\nstandard conscious experience, are arguably absent or diminished in\nunusual clinical cases, and in particular in \u201csplit-brain\u201d\npatients. (See Bayne 2008 and Schechter 2018 for philosophical\nexploration of clinical accounts regarding the reports of split-brain\npatients.) This suggests a physicalist strategy of using these unusual\nphenomena as a tool for chipping away at the ostensible\nphenomenological basis for rejecting the possibility of an eventual\nphysicalist account of consciousness. (See\n entry on the unity of consciousness,\n Sect. 4 for a survey of such disorders of unified consciousness and\ndiscussions of their possible implications.) An alternative, perhaps\ncomplementary physicalist strategy is to argue that certain seeming\naspects of consciousness are simply illusions which can be\nexplained in terms of inevitable organizational tradeoffs in the\nconstruction of finite minds (see Pereboom 2011 and Chalmers\n2018).\n5.1.2 The qualitative and intentional character of mental states\n\nEven more than the nature and unity of conscious awareness, certain\nseeming intrinsic characteristics\u2014so-called\n\u201cqualia\u201d\u2014of conscious states have seemed to many to\nrequire an anti-physicalist ontological account. The way a patch of\nredness appears in one\u2019s visual field, or the sound of a trumpet\nnote in one\u2019s auditory field, do not seem to admit of\ncharacterization in terms of neural processes within the visual and\nauditory cortex. Rather, such experiential qualities seem to be\ndistinctive in kind, engendering a mismatch with the\nphysical-structural or functional kinds posited by physical theories,\nand to have a degree of simplicity that is incongruent with the\nmassive physical complexity of the associated physical processes. (For\ntwo much-discussed arguments from these apparent characteristics of\nconscious experience to at least a modest form of physical-mental\ndualism, see Jackson 1982 and\n entry on qualia and the knowledge argument;\n and Chalmers 1996 and\n entry on zombies.)\n\nSome accept this claim regarding these \u201cphenomenal\u201d\nqualities of conscious experience, but think that there is no\ncorresponding deep challenge to physicalism with regards to the\nintentional properties of experiences, representing what the\nworld around us is like (again, Jackson 1982 and Chalmers 1996). (This\nlimited anti-physicalism most lends itself to\u2014although it does\nnot entail\u2014the epiphenomenalist version of strong emergence\ndiscussed in\n 4.2.1\n above, as it is consistent with the claim that information-processing\nintentional states are the only mental states that causally contribute\nto the individual\u2019s future mental and physical states.) However,\none may question the independence of phenomenal and intentional\nproperties (see, e.g., Horgan & Tienson 2002), and some go so far\nas to conjecture that intentional properties are in some way\nconstituted by phenomenal properties (Mendelovici 2018, Woodward\n2019). If some such connection thesis is correct, then not only\nexperiences, but other cognitive states such as belief and desire may\nresist purely physical characterization (see\n entry on phenomenal intentionality).\n5.1.3 Conscious will & agency\n\nHuman and other animals are not only experiencers and knowers but also\ndoers. (The nature of non-human animal choice or volition and their\nconcomitant experience of action is here set aside, as it is difficult\nto conjecture concerning it with any confidence on present knowledge.)\nMany take Aristotle to have expressed a truism when he said that the\nchoice of how to act is \u201cup to us\u201d, unlike the inevitable\nunfolding of causal processes lacking in rationality or other sources\nof deliberative choice. It is widely claimed that the human experience\nof conscious, deliberate choice (\u201cwilling\u201d) is of direct,\n\u201ctop down\u201d control over one\u2019s action by the agent\n(see, e.g., O\u2019Connor 2000: Ch.1&4; for an overview of\ndiscussions regarding agential experience, see Bayne 2017 and Woodward\nforthcoming). At least sometimes, we seem to ourselves not to be\nmerely loci in which a host of psychological and merely physical\ninfluences converge and resolve themselves in behavior, but rather to\nexercise a power to decide which among the options we are considering\nwe shall take, thereby determining whether and how these influences\nwill be acted upon.\n\nSuch agential experience, if veridical, might indicate that the\nability to freely choose is strongly emergent. On one account, free\nchoice manifests a distinctive power that, unlike typical powers, is\nneither causally \u201ctriggered\u201d by a stimulus condition nor\nis made more or less probable by antecedent factors (Lowe 2008, 2013).\nAlternatively, the kind of power agential experience represents is\nconsistent with non-determining causal influences that collectively\nconfer objective probabilities on possible choices (O\u2019Connor\n2008). On either understanding, conscious control over one\u2019s own\nactions through exercising the power of choice is at odds with a\nphysicalist conception on which all systemic behavior is fixed by the\narrangement and activity of the system\u2019s parts. Coupled with the\nplausible position that mental states of whatever variety depend on\nlower-level physical states, such a result might be seen as providing\nsupport for taking free will to be a strongly emergent power.\n\nAgential experience is defeasible, and cognitive and social psychology\nand more recently neuroscience have been probing the determinants of\nchoice and its relationship to conscious awareness. One particular\nform of study has been taken by many to undermine the veridicality of\nthe experience of conscious control over arbitrary choice. Libet 1999\nand more sophisticated successor studies aim to compare the\nself-reported time of occurrence of conscious choice with the time of\noccurrence of certain brain activity (a steadily increasing\n\u201creadiness potential\u201d) that Libet took to be associated\nwith the production of the subsequent action. He interpreted the\nresults as indicating that the behavior was unconsciously initiated by\nthat brain activity just prior to the time of the\nsubject\u2019s awareness of having so chosen, and hence that the\nagent\u2019s sense that she consciously initiated the action is\nillusory.\n\nPhilosophers have roundly criticized the \u201cno free will\u201d\ninterpretation of these studies offered by Libet and some other\nneuroscientists (see Mele 2009 for a thorough discussion and Caruso 2012: 189ff, for a dissent from the\nconsensus). Many have emphasized that the \u201cchoices\u201d\nLibet\u2019s subjects are asked to make depart from paradigmatically\nfree cases in important ways. Some note that the ability of subjects\nto precisely time their own conscious events of any kind (including\nsimple perceptual cues) have been shown to be not fully reliable:\ntheir estimates can be manipulated by conscious primes before and\nafter the target event. (They also come in degrees of intensity, such\nthat the onset of an event that might quickly intensify or otherwise\nevolve might be more difficult to determine than the event itself.)\nOthers observe that the studies do not even purport to identify a\ndetermining physical antecedent to conscious choice. Finally,\nother recent studies (beginning with Schurger et al. 2012) have called\ninto question just what kind of neural activity Libet-style studies\nare tracking, and in particular whether it is even involved in the\nproduction of choice and subsequent behavior. All this remains a\nsubject of continued scientific study and debate. (A large-scale\nproject is currently underway that is developing a wide array of\nexperimental probes of conscious will and its physical determinants:\n< https://neurophil-freewill.org/> For an overview of\nphilosophical and empirical issues concerning human free will, see\n entry on free will.)\n5.2 Physical Science\n5.2.1 Quantum Entanglement\n\nA striking feature of quantum mechanics is known as \u201cquantum\nentanglement\u201d. When two (or more) quantum particles or systems\ninteract in certain ways and are then (even space-like) separated,\ntheir measurable features (e.g., position and momentum) will correlate\nin ways that cannot be accounted for in terms of \u201cpure\u201d\nquantum states of each particle or system separately. In other words,\nthe two need to be thought of as a coupled system, having certain\nfeatures which are in no sense a compositional or other resultant of\nindividual states of the system\u2019s components (see Silberstein\n& McGeever 1999 and entries on\n holism and nonseparability in physics\n and\n quantum entanglement and information).\n Humphreys (2016) construes this as an instance of emergent fusion\n (section 4.2.4).\n Insofar as these features have physical effects, they indicate a\nnear-ubiquitous failure of whole-part property supervenience at a very\nsmall scale. However, it should be observed that quantum entanglement\ndoes not manifest a fundamental novelty in feature or associated\ncausal power, as it concerns only the value or magnitude of a\nfeature/associated power had by its components. (Correlated\n\u201cspin\u201d values, e.g., are permutations on the fundamental\nfeature of spin, rather than being akin to mass or charge as wholly\ndistinctive features.) As such, it does not fit the criteria of many\naccounts of strongly emergence. It is, however, relevant to the\nepistemic status of such accounts: if one thinks that the existence of\nstrong emergence is implausible on grounds that a kind of strong local\nsupervenience is a priori very plausible for composed systems\ngenerally, then the surprising phenomenon of quantum entanglement\nshould lead you to be more circumspect in your assumptions regarding\nhow complex systems are put together.\n5.2.2 Quantum Chemistry\n\nThe interface of physics with chemistry has long been thought to\nsupport ontological reductionism (or physicalism, more generally).\nThis sentiment goes back to an early declaration by Paul Dirac, one of\nthe founding figures of quantum mechanics:\n\n\nThe underlying laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a larger\npart of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known,\nand the difficulty is only that exact applications of these laws lead\nto equations much too complicated to be soluble. (1929: 714)\n\n\nIn recent decades, there has recently been reconsideration of this\nperspective. Hendry (1998, 2010, 2017, 2019), following Woolley (1978,\n1998) and Primas (1981), contends, to the contrary, that molecular\nstructure is (or may well be) strongly emergent, in failing to be\nwholly determined by the arrangements of a molecule\u2019s quantum\nconstituents; isomers, which have distinct molecular structure yet the\nsame subatomic constituents, are a particular focus in these\ndiscussions. Scerri (2012) criticizes this line of thought, suggesting\nthat it overlooks the possibility that a molecule\u2019s\nquantum-mechanical interaction with its environment may contribute to\nfixing its overall structure. It should be noted that the details of\nScerri\u2019s counter-proposal depend on a particular\n(collapse-based) interpretation of quantum mechanics. There has been a\nsteady uptick of discussion of this issue among philosophers of\nchemistry, and it appears to be unresolved at present. This in turn\nsuggests that, contra Dirac, strong emergence even at the interface of\nphysics and chemistry remains a live possibility. (For further\ndiscussion, see Hettema (2015) and entry on\n philosophy of chemistry,\n Section 6.)\n5.2.3 Spacetime\n\nFundamental physics encompasses two successful theories, General\nRelativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT), that are mutually\ninconsistent. In recent years, a number of Quantum Gravity theories\nhave been put forward as candidate deeper theories that can account\nfor core dynamical principles and successful predictions of both\ntheories within one consistent framework. Strikingly, in almost all\nsuch theories, spacetime is not part of the fundamental ontology, it\nbeing supplanted by a framework that lacks at least some of its\nstructure. Many theorists say that the spacetime of GR is thereby\nrendered emergent. Its dependence is reflected in how the many roles\nthat spacetime plays in GR and the spatiotemporally structured\nexperimental observations themselves (and indeed, ubiquitous\nperceptions of everyday life!) are grounded in nonspatiotemporal\nstructures in the proposed fundamental theories. Its autonomy takes\nthe form of nonfundamental spacetime\u2019s being qualitatively\ndifferent from any feature of the fundamental theory.\n\nThe issues raised by such radical proposals are complex, and it is\neven debated whether they are empirically coherent, given the role\nthat space and time play in our understanding of physical causation\nand empirical observation, and hence of empirical evidence itself. For\npresent purposes, the key point is that such theories propose\nsystematic theoretical reductions, akin to the reduction of\nthermodynamics to statistical mechanics, with a concommitant\nontological reduction of the structures of the reduced theories. In\nthis, the case appears unlike the relationship between physics and\nbiology as weak emergentists see it, in which biological entities\nappear to be special kinds of organized physical structures that\nexplain equally distinctive phenomena that are unexplained by more\nfundamental theories. For a non-technical introduction to some of the\ntheories at issue and the case for describing them as entailing\nspacetime emergence, see W\u00fcthrich (2019). For more general\nphilosophical reflection on our ordinary concepts of space and time\nand their compatibility with theories that treat them as\nnonfundamental, see Chalmers (forthcoming).\n5.3 Pluralist interpretations of the general ontology of the sciences\n\nChampions of physicalism see the marked successes of the physical and\nbiological sciences in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as\nestablishing, at a minimum, that the characteristic processes at all\nlevels of these domains are fixed by fundamental physical states and\nprocesses. However, some draw a different conclusion from these\nadvances, seeing new bases for strongly emergentist perspectives.\n\nMany sciences treating complex systems of one or other variety have\nundergone extensive and impressive development in the last fifty\nyears. Theorists in these disciplines freely use terms such as\n\u201cemergence\u201d and \u201ctop-down causation\u201d to\ndescribe the phenomena they study. It is often unclear, however,\nwhether they are best interpreted as describing weakly or strongly\nemergent states and associated behavior. Among those who have\nreflected recently on the state of their discipline, solid state\nphysicist Laughlin (2005), systems biologists Noble (2006) and Boogerd\n(Boogerd et al. 2005, 2007), and neuroscientist Walter Freeman (1999,\n2000) and cosmologist Ellis (2016) appear to advocate\nstrongly emergentist accounts of aspects of solid state\nphysics, biological life, and the human mind, respectively. They argue\nthat the pertinent sciences encompassing these domains give equal,\ncomplementary places to \u201cbottom up\u201d and \u201ctop\ndown\u201d determinants and principles, and argue that we cannot\nunderstand the latter as themselves ultimately fixed by instances of\nthe former. The general thrust of their detailed arguments is that\nthere is no fully \u201cbottom up\u201d way to describe, let alone\nexplain, certain organized phenomena. See also Ellis, Noble, and\nO\u2019Connor (2012) for a collection of state-of-the-art overviews\nof the interaction of top-down and bottom-up principles in numerous\nscientific domains, from fundamental physics to sociology.\n\nFinally, philosopher Nancy Cartwright (1983, 1994, 1999) has defended\nover several decades a thorough-going \u201cpatchwork\u201d or\npluralistic understanding of the relation between the sciences, as an\nalternative to the sort of \u201cphysics-at-the-bottom\u201d,\nasymmetrical hierarchy common to weak emergentists and reductionists\nalike. She argues that close consideration of scientific practice\nsuggests that fundamental physical laws hold only in certain\nartificial contexts limited to small-scale systems, which systems are\nmaintained by macroscopic barriers and mechanisms serving to screen\noff \u201cdownward\u201d causal effects. She suggests that such\ncarefully contrived results can give us no reasonable confidence in a\nvision on which all of natural reality is fixed by the unfolding of\nbottom-up physical laws alone. While arguing in somewhat different\nways, Dupr\u00e9 (1993) is sympathetic to the general pluralist or\n\u201canti-fundamentalist\u201d thrust of Cartwright\u2019s\nperspective. More generally, if anything like Cartwright\u2019s view\nis correct, and the right ontological characterization of the\nunderlying pluralism is one according to which there is fundamental\nnovelty across the spectrum of natural reality, one might naturally\ntake strong emergence to be much more prevalent than even its\nproponents have usually assumed. This perspective has affinities to\nthe \u201ctransformational\u201d accounts of emergence noted in\n section 4.2.4.\n For discussion of the broad issues raised by Cartwright, see Cat\n(1998) and entry on\n the unity of science,\n Section 5.",
