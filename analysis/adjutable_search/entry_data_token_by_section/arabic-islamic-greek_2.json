    "main_text": "The translations of the \u201ccircle of al-Kindi\u201d: Aristotle, the Neoplatonic tradition and the rise of falsafa.\n3. The translations of the \u201ccircle of al-Kindi\u201d: Aristotle, the Neoplatonic tradition and the rise of falsafa.\n\nA great deal of translations made under the reign of al-Ma\u2019mun\n(r. 813\u2013833) and his successors are extant. The new\ninterpretation of Islam and of the role of the caliph promoted by\n al-Ma\u2019mun,[20]\n as well as the increasing interest in the secular sciences of the\nelites of Islamic\n society,[21]\n created the context for the development of the translations into\nArabic. Even though the court library (Bayt\nal-hikma,\u201cHouse of\n Wisdom\u201d)[22]\n cannot be viewed as an institutional center for the translations of\nGreek works into\n Arabic,[23]\n a close relationship existed between the activities of the first\ngroup of translators and the court. The leader of this group, the\nencyclopaedic scientist and first faylasuf Abu Ya\u02bfqub\nibn Ishaq\n al-Kindi,[24]\n was appointed as the preceptor of the son of the successor of\nal-Ma\u2019mun, al-Mu\u02bftasim (r. 833\u2013842): one of\nKindi\u2019s works is addressed to al-Ma\u2019mun, whereas his major\nmetaphysical writing, On First\n Philosophy,[25]\n is addressed to al-Mu\u02bftasim. How do we know that there was a\ngroup of translators and that al-Kindi was its leader? The ancient\nsources give a hint to this, in so far as they mention, for instance,\nthat the earliest translation of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics was made for\n him.[26]\n Also, the incipit of the well-known\n Theology of Aristotle\n claims that he acted as the revisor of this work, in fact an adapted\ntranslation of parts of Plotinus\u2019 Enneads IV\u2013VI.\nSince it has been established (Endress 1973) that the same lexical and\nsyntactical features of the two translations just mentioned are shared\nby other translations from Greek, one can be reasonably sure that\nseveral translators exchanged among themselves and with al-Kindi: the\nlatter has been described as the spiritus rector of this\ngroup (Endress 1997a; 2007). The translations of this circle include\nworks by Plato, Aristotle, Nicomachus of Gerasa, Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Plotinus, Proclus, John Philoponus and Olympiodorus. It\nis worth noting that the texts of Plotinus, and in part those of\nProclus and Philoponus, did not circulate under the names of their\nauthors: Plotinus circulated under the name of Aristotle (Rosenthal\n1974), Proclus under those of Aristotle and Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nand Philoponus under the name of Alexander (see below).\n\nPlato. An early translation of the Timaeus\nis mentioned in the bio-bibliographical\n sources,[27]\n but it has not come down to us. The circulation of at least parts of\nthe\n Symposium,[28]\nPhaedo (Aouad 1989a; Gutas 2012, 855), and\n Republic[29]\n should be acknowledged in the age of al-Kindi.\n\nAristotle. The early translation of the\nMetaphysics made for al-Kindi has come down to\n us;[30]\n the translator is the otherwise unknown\n Ustath.[31]\n Other Aristotelian works translated within the Kindi\u2019s circle\nare the Prior\n Analytics,[32]\nSophistici\n Elenchi,[33]\nDe\n Caelo,[34]\nMeteorologica,[35] De Generatione\nanimalium and De Partibus\n animalium,[36]\nParva Naturalia and possibly the De\n Anima,[37]\n plus a paraphrasis of this work in clear Neoplatonic vein (Arnzen\n1998; 2003; Gannag\u00e9 2012, 533). As shown by Ullmann\n(2011\u20132012), the Arabic translation of Books V\u2013X of the\nNicomachean Ethics must be traced back to Ustath (see also\nSchmidt-Ullmann 2012). In addition to the genuine Aristotelian works,\nsome pseudepigrapha were also either translated in this period, or\nproduced within the circle of al-Kindi: these are of pivotal\nimportance for the rise and development of falsafa. It has\nbeen established on firm grounds (Endress 1973) that the circle of\nal-Kindi produced the translation and reworking of significant parts\nof the Enneads IV\u2013VI (known as the Theology of\n Aristotle)[38]\n as well as the translation and reworking of Proclus\u2019\nElements of Theology (known as the Book by Aristotle on\nthe Pure Good). The\n Theology[39]\n was the most influential of the two in the Arabic-speaking world,\nwhereas the Book by Aristotle on the Pure\n Good[40]\n was bound to become immensely famous in the Latin world, under the\ntitle Liber de Causis. Other pseudo-Aristotelian writings\ntrace back to this period: the K. al-tuffaha (Liber de\nPomo), namely, a reworking of the Phaedo with Aristotle\nreplacing the dying Socrates (Aouad 1989a; Gutas 2012, 855), and a\nPhysiognomic (Thomann 2003).\n\nNicomachus of Gerasa. The Introduction to\nArithmetic was translated within the circle of al-Kindi\n(Altmann-Stern 1958, 35; Endress 1997a, 55; Freudenthal 2005).\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. (i) Commentaries. The first\nbook of Alexander\u2019s commentary on the De Gen. corr.,\nlost in Greek, is said to have been translated by Qusta ibn\n Luqa,[41]\n a physician and translator who came from Baalbek to Baghdad in the\nfirst decades of the 9th century and had exchanges on medical and\nphilosophical matters with\n al-Kindi.[42]\n (ii) Personal works. Of prominent importance are two writings lost in\nGreek: On Providence (Fazzo-Wiesner 1993) and a cosmological\ntreatise known in Arabic as On the First Cause, the effect and its\nmovements (ed. Endress 2002). From the circle of al-Kindi comes\nalso the translation of a series of Alexander\u2019s genuine\nQuaestiones, intermingled in the manuscript sources with\npropositions of Proclus\u2019 Elements of Theology,\nattributed to Alexander (Endress 1973; overview on the Arabic\nAlexander by Genequand 2011 and 2017).\n\nPlotinus. Around AD 840 parts of Enneads\nIV\u2013VI (devoted in the Porphyrian edition of Plotinus\u2019\nwritings to soul, the intelligible world and the One) were translated\ninto\n Arabic.[43]\n The problems about this translation, and in particular about the\ntransformation of parts of it into the Theology of Aristotle,\nare dealt with in a separate\n entry.[44]\n For present purposes, it will suffice to mention the fact that at the\nbeginning of the Theology of Aristotle an author, speaking as\nif he were Aristotle, proclaims to have devoted this treatise to the\nFirst Cause, Intellect and Soul, after having dealt with matter, form,\nthe efficient and final causes in his Metaphysics. This\nproclaimed \u201cAristotelian\u201d authorship of the Theology\n granted Plotinus\u2019 doctrine an extraordinary impact on\nsubsequent Arabic philosophy, especially in the East of the Muslim\nworld.\n\nProclus. As we have seen before, the Elements of\nTheology were translated into Arabic within the circle of\nal-Kindi (Endress 1973; on later circulation, see Wakelnig 2006, 2011;\nup-to-date survey by Endress 2012); some propositions were attributed\nto Alexander of Aphrodisias under various titles\u2014On the\nFirst Cause, On the Existence of Spiritual Forms with no\nmatter, On the Difference between eternity and time,\nOn Coming-to-be, On the Body (van Ess 1966; Endress\n1973; Zimmermann 1994). This collection of Proclus\u2019 propositions\nis sometimes labelled as Account of what Alexander has extracted\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s book called Theology (Endress 1973, 53;\nZimmermann 1986, 189\u201390; Goulet-Aouad 1989a, 133; Fazzo 2003,\n64\u20135). Another writing by Proclus, extant in Greek only through\nthe quotations by John Philoponus in his De Aeternitate\nmundi, was translated into Arabic in this period: the\nEighteen arguments on the Eternity of the Cosmos against the\nChristians (Endress 1973, 15\u201316; Endress 2012,\n1657\u201361; see also Wakelnig 2012).\n\nJohn Philoponus. The bio-bibliographical sources\nmention his commentary on the Physics, translated partly by\nIbn Na\u02bfima al-Himsi and partly by Qusta ibn\n Luqa.[45]\n Also, fragments of an adapted translation of parts of the De\nAeternitate mundi were\n known[46]\n under the name of Alexander of Aphrodisias (Hasnaoui 1994; Giannakis\n2002\u20133; Gannag\u00e9 2012, 535\u20137).\n\nOlympiodorus. A commentary on the De Gen.\ncorr., lost in Greek, is said to have been translated by\n Ustath.[47]\n\nIn addition to these works, translated within the circle of al-Kindi,\ntwo doxographies were translated into Arabic in this period: the\nPlacita of the pseudo-Plutarch, accounting for Greek\ncosmologies from the Presocratics to the\n Stoics,[48]\n and the Refutation of all the Heresies by Hyppolitus of\nRome; the latter was reworked in light of the theological discussions\nof the 9th century Baghdad and attributed to Ammonius, the Alexandrian\ncommentator of\n Aristotle.[49]\n\nThanks to this first set of translations, learned Muslims became\nacquainted with Plato\u2019s Demiurge and immortal soul; with\nAristotle\u2019s search for science and knowledge of the causes of\nall the phenomena on earth and in the heavens, culminating in the\ndoctrine of the Unmoved Mover; with Alexander\u2019s cosmology and\nexplanation of providence; with Plotinus\u2019 hierarchy of the\nprinciples One, Intellect and Soul; with Proclus\u2019 systematic\naccount of how the One\u2014indisputably identified with\nAristotle\u2019s Unmoved Mover\u2014gives rise to the multiplicity\nof our universe; finally, with John Philoponus\u2019 philosophical\narguments for creation. The translation of Proclus\u2019 arguments in\nfavour of the eternity of the cosmos against the Christians, as well\nas of John Philoponus\u2019 reply to them, also made learned Muslims\nacquainted with the fact that the Greek philosophers were at odds on\nsome crucial issues. The adaptations which appear in the reworking\nboth of Plotinus\u2019 Enneads (D\u2019Ancona 2006) and of\nHyppolitus doxography attributed to Ammonius (Rudolph 1998) show the\nstrategy to deal with this problem typical of the circle of al-Kindi:\na strategy which would be successful in the long run. The idea of the\nbasic unity of the Greek philosophical tradition and the twin claim of\nits intrinsic harmony with the Qur\u2019anic doctrine of the\ntawhid (divine oneness) will be established by the\nendorsment, apparent in Kindi\u2019s own works, of the Aristotelian\nmodel of the accumulation of knowledge by trial and error\n(Metaphysics, A and alpha elatton).\n\nHis [Kindi\u2019s] treatise On the First Philosophy\ndemonstrates in an elaborate deduction, dependent directly or\nindirectly on the Platonic Theology of Proclus, the absolute\nunity of the First Cause. Philosophy is engaged to defend the\ntawhid, the fundamental tenet of Islamic monotheism, against\nthe temptation of dualism. Concepts provided by the Christian\nNeoplatonism of Johannes Philoponus and by Arabic excerpts from\nPlotinus and Proclus (available to him under the name of Aristotle)\nare used to describe the First Cause as the Creator of the world, the\nefficient cause of a creatio ex nihilo (ibda\u02bf).\nThe perennial hikma of the ancient philosophy is thus shown\nto give guidance towards unequivocal and irrefutable knowledge,\n\u2018even though they may have fallen short slightly of some of the\ntruth\u2019. (\u2026) Al-Kindi\u2019s creed will be echoed for\ncenturies later by Ibn Rushd in his Decisive Word in defense\nof philosophy: \u2018The truth will not contradict the truth\u2019.\n(Endress 1990, 6\u20137)\n\n",
