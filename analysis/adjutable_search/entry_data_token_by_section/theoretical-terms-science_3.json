    "main_text": "Criticisms and Refinements of the Theory-Observation Distinction || Refinements\n2.2 Refinements\n\nThere is a simple, intuitive and influential proposal how to\nrelativize the theory-observation distinction in a sensible way: a\nterm t is theoretical with respect to a theory T, or\nfor short, a T-term if and only if it is introduced by the\ntheory T at a certain stage in the history of science.\nO-terms, by contrast, are those that were antecedently available and\nunderstood before T was set forth (Lewis 1970; cf. Hempel\n1973). This proposal draws the theory-observation distinction in an\napparently sharp way by means of relativizing that distinction to a\nparticular theory. Needless to say, the proposal is in line with the\ncontextual theory of meaning.\n\nThe distinction between T-terms and antecedently available\nO-terms has two particular merits. First, it circumvents the view that\nany sharp line between theoretical and observational terms is\nconventional and arbitrary. Second, it connects the theory-observation\ndistinction with what seemed to have motivated that distinction in the\nfirst place, viz., an investigation how we come to understand the\nmeaning of terms that appear to be meaningful in virtue of certain\nscientific theories.\n\nA similar proposal of a relativized theory-observation distinction was\nmade by Sneed in his seminal The Logical Structure of Mathematical\nPhysics (1979: ch. II). Here is a simplified and more syntactic\nformulation of Sneed\u2019s criterion of T-theoreticity:\n\n\nDefinition 1 (T-theoreticity) \n\nA term t is theoretical with respect to the theory\nT, or for short, T-theoretical if and only if any\nmethod of determining the extension of t, or some part of\nthat extension, rests on some axiom of T.\n\n\nIt remains to explain what it is for a method m of\ndetermining the extension of t to rest upon an axiom\n\\(\\phi\\). This relation obtains if and only if the use of m\ndepends on \\(\\phi\\) being a true sentence. In other\nwords, m rests upon \\(\\phi\\) if and only if the\nhypothetical assumption of \\(\\phi\\) being false or indeterminate would\ninvalidate the use of m in the sense that we would\nbe lacking the commonly presumed justification for using m.\nThe qualification \u2018or some part of that\nextension\u2019 has been introduced in the present definition because\nwe cannot expect a single measurement method to determine the\nextension of a scientific quantity completely.\nT-non-theoreticity is the negation of\nT-theoreticity:\n\n\nDefinition 2 (T-non-theoreticity) \n\nA term t is T-non-theoretical if and only if it is\nnot T-theoretical.\n\n\nThe concepts of classical particle mechanics (henceforth abbreviated\nby CPM) exemplify well the notions of T-theoreticity and\nT-non-theoreticity. As has been indicated above, all methods\nof determining the force acting upon a particle make use of some axiom\nof classical particle mechanics, such as Newton\u2019s laws of motion\nor some law about special forces. Hence, force is CPM-theoretical.\nMeasurement of spatial distances, by contrast, is possible without\nusing axioms of CPM. Hence, the concept of spatial distance is\nCPM-non-theoretical. The concept of mass is less straightforward to\nclassify as we can measure this concept using classical collision\nmechanics (CCM). Still, it was seen to be CPM-theoretical by the\nstructuralists since CCM appeared reducible to CPM (Balzer et al.\n1987: ch. 2).\n\nSuppose for a term t once introduced by a scientific theory\n\\(T_1\\) novel methods of determination become established through\nanother theory \\(T_2\\), where these methods do not depend on any axiom\nof \\(T_1\\). Then, t would neither qualify as\n\\(T_1\\)-theoretical nor as \\(T_2\\)-theoretical. It is preferable, in\nthis situation, to relativize Definition 1 to theory-nets N,\ni.e., compounds of several theories. Whether there\nare such cases has not yet been settled.\n\nThe original exposition of the theoreticity criterion by Sneed (1979)\nis a bit more involved as it makes use of set-theoretic predicates and\nintended applications, rather technical notions of the\nstructuralist approach to scientific theories. There has been\na lively discussion, mainly but not exclusively within the\nstructuralist school, how to express the relativized notion of\ntheoreticity most properly (Balzer 1986; 1996). As noted above, Kuhn\n(1976) proposed a twofold relativization of theoreticity, viz., first\nto a scientific theory and second to applications of such\ntheories.\n\nNotably, Sneed\u2019s criterion of T-theoreticity suggests a\nstrategy that allows us to regain a global, non-relativized\ntheory-observation distinction: simply take a term t to be\ntheoretical if and only if it holds, for all methods m\nof determining its extension, that m\nrests upon some axiom of some theory T. A\nterm t is non-theoretical, or observational, if and only if\nthere are means of determining its extension, at least in part, that\ndo not rest upon any axiom of any theory. This criterion is still\nrelative to our present stage of explicit theories but comes closer to\nthe original intention of Carnap\u2019s theory-observation\ndistinction, according to which observation is understood in the\nnarrow sense of unaided perception.\n",
