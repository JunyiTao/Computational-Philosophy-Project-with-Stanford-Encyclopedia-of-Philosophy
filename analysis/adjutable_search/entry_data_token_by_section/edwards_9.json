    "main_text": "Epistemology || Sanctified Reason\n5. The History of Redemption\n\nThe trustees of the College of New Jersey invited Edwards to become\nits third president in 1753. In his reply Edwards gave a number of\nreasons why he hesitated to accept their offer. Among these was the\nfear that doing so would interfere with the completion of \u201ca\ngreat work\u201d which he had long contemplated \u201cwhich I call a\nHistory of the Work of Redemption, a body of divinity in an\nentire new method, being thrown into the form of an history;\nconsidering the affair of Christian theology, as the whole of it, in\neach part, stands in reference to the great work of redemption by\nJesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 16, 727f).\nAlthough Edwards' project was aborted by his untimely death, it would\nundoubtedly have been based on a sermon series delivered in 1739 which\ntraces the work of redemption \u201cfrom the fall of man to the end\nof the world.\u201d The proposed history would have been the\nculmination of the project begun in True Virtue and End\nof Creation. For creation and providence are subordinate to a\nredemption which is itself subordinate only to God's glory. The\nhistory of redemption is \u201cthe summum and\nultimum of all the divine operations and decrees,\u201d the\nmanifestation of God's internal glory in time (Edwards 1957\u2013,\nvol. 16, 728). Edwards' History would also have provided a\nfitting climax to his intellectual career as a whole. For it is in his\nwork of redemption that God's sovereignty, holiness, and splendor are\nmost fully displayed. \n\nIt is doubtful, however, that Edwards' work would have anticipated\nmodern historiography as some claim. For one thing, the sermon series\nis essentially a doctrinal work. (The section on Christ's\nearthly ministry, for instance, is a discussion of the incarnation and\natonement, not a life of Jesus.) For another, Edwards' sources include\nnot only biblical and \u201cprofane\u201d histories but biblical\nprophecy as well. Finally, Edwards doesn't restrict himself to natural\ncauses in explaining events but also appeals to divine decrees and\ntypology.\n\nWhatever novelty the sermon series possesses is literary and\ntheological. It partly consists in the rich skein of images Edwards\nuses to connect the events of redemption history. These include the\nmodel of a river and its tributaries, a tree and its branches, the\nconstruction of a building, the conduct of war, and \u201ca\nwheel,\u201d or \u201ca machine composed of wheels\u201d with its\nreminiscences both of Ezekiel's vision of the divine throne chariot\nand of clockwork (\u201cImages of Divine Things,\u201d no. 89;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 11, 86). It also consists in Edwards'\nextension of typology, the practice of interpreting things, persons,\nor events (the \u201ctype\u201d) as symbols or prefigurations of\nfuture realities (the \u201cantitype\u201d). Protestant divines had\ntended to restrict typology to figures, actions, and objects in the\nOld Testament which in their view shadowed forth Christ as their\nantitype. Edwards interprets the New Testament typologically as well,\narguing that relevant passages prefigure events in the church's later\nhistory. Most radically, Edwards construes nature typologically.\n(Whether this constitutes a step towards Emerson and Thoreau, as some\nclaim, is a moot point.) Finally, Edwards' emphasis on the objective\nside of God's act of redemption is comparatively rare in a Puritanism\nwhich tended to stress the redemption's application to individual\nsouls. (The subjective side is extensively treated in a number of\nworks of the 1730s and 1740s, however, the most important of which is\nReligious Affections.)\n",
