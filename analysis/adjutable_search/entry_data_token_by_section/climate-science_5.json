These\npaleoclimatic investigations rely on proxies: aspects of the\nnatural environment that are \u201cinterpreted, using physical and\nbiophysical principles, to represent some combination of\nclimate-related variations back in time\u201d (IPCC-glossary: 1460).\nFor example, variations in the ratio of different isotopes of oxygen\nin deep ice cores and in the fossilized shells of tiny animals serve\nas proxies for variations in temperature. Additional proxies for\nclimate-related variables come via tree rings, corals, lake sediments,\nboreholes and other sources (PAGES-2K-Consortium 2013; Masson-Delmotte\net al. 2013).\n\nProducing proxy-based paleoclimate reconstructions, especially on\nhemispheric or global scales, involves a host of methodological\nchallenges. Just a few will be mentioned here. First, as the\ncharacterization above suggests, proxies often reflect the influence\nof multiple environmental factors at once. For example, tree rings can\nbe influenced not only by temperature but also by precipitation, soil\nquality, cloud cover, etc., which makes it more difficult to\nconfidently infer a single variable of interest, such as temperature.\nSecond, proxies often must be calibrated using recent observations\nmade with meteorological instruments, but the instrumental record\ncovers only a very short period in earth\u2019s history, and factors\nshaping the proxy in the distant past may be somewhat different.\nThird, proxies of a given type can have limited geographical coverage:\nice cores are found only at the poles, tree rings are absent in\nlocations where there is no distinct growing season, and so on.\nFourth, the temporal resolution of different types of proxy can differ\nmarkedly\u2014from a single year to a century or more\u2014adding a\nlayer of complexity when attempting to use multiple proxies together.\nFor these reasons and others, quantifying the uncertainties associated\nwith proxy reconstructions is also a significant challenge (Frank et\nal. 2010).\n\nDespite these challenges, climate scientists have produced\npaleoclimatic reconstructions covering various regions, time periods\nand climate-related variables, including temperature, precipitation,\nstreamflow, vegetation and more. Temperature reconstructions in\nparticular have been a source of controversy (see\n Section 5.3),\n in part because they underwrite conclusions like this one, from the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment\nReport: the period 1983\u20132012 was very likely (i.e.,\nprobability >0.95) the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years\n(Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013: 386). Vez\u00e9r (2016a) suggests that\ninferences to such conclusions can be characterized as a form of\nvariety-of-evidence reasoning, insofar as they involve multiple\ntemperature reconstructions informed by different proxies,\nmethodological assumptions and statistical techniques (see also\nOreskes 2007).\n",
