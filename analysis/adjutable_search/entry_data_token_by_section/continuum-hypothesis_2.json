    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || Three Versions\n2.1 Three Versions\nThere are three different formulations of the continuum\nhypothesis\u2014the interpolant version,\nthe well-ordering version, and the surjection\nversion. These versions are all equivalent to one another in ZFC but\nwe shall be imposing a definability constraint and in this case there\ncan be interesting differences (our discussion follows\nMartin (1976)). There is really a hierarchy of notions\nof definability\u2014ranging up through the Borel hierarchy, the\nprojective hierarchy, the hierarchy in L(\u211d), and, more\ngenerally, the hierarchy of universally Baire sets\u2014and so each\nof these three general versions is really a hierarchy of versions,\neach corresponding to a given level of the hierarchy of\ndefinability (for a discussion of the hierarchy of\ndefinability see \n\u00a72.2.1 and \n\u00a74.6 of the entry \n \u201cLarge Cardinals and Determinacy\u201d).\n\n2.1.1 Interpolant Version\nThe first formulation of CH is that there is\nno interpolant, that is, there is no infinite set A\nof real numbers such that the cardinality of A is strictly\nbetween that of the natural numbers and the real numbers. To obtain\ndefinable versions one simply asserts that there is no\n\u201cdefinable\u201d interpolant and this leads to a hierarchy of\ndefinable interpolant versions, depending on which notion of\ndefinability one employs. More precisely, for a given pointclass\n\u0393 in the hierarchy of definable sets of reals, the corresponding\ndefinable interpolant version of CH asserts that there is no\ninterpolant in \u0393. \n The Cantor-Bendixson theorem shows that there is no interpolant in\n\u0393 in the case where \u0393 is the pointclass of closed sets,\nthus verifying this version of CH. This was improved by Suslin who\nshowed that this version of CH holds for \u0393 where \u0393 is the\nclass of \u03a3\u033011 sets. One cannot go much further within ZFC\u2014to prove stronger\nversions one must bring in stronger assumptions. It turns out that\naxioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms achieve\nthis. For example, results of Kechris and Martin show that if\n\u0394\u03301n-determinacy\nholds then this version of CH holds for the pointclass of\n\u03a3\u03301n+1\nsets. Going further, if one assumes ADL(\u211d) then\nthis version of CH holds for all sets of real numbers appearing in\nL(\u211d). Since these hypotheses follow from large cardinal axioms\none also has that stronger and stronger large cardinal assumptions\nsecure stronger and stronger versions of this version of the effective\ncontinuum hypothesis. Indeed large cardinal axioms imply that this\nversion of CH holds for all sets of reals in the definability\nhierarchy we are considering; more precisely, if there is a proper\nclass of Woodin cardinals then this version of CH holds for all\nuniversally Baire sets of reals. \n2.1.2 Well-ordering Version\nThe second formulation of CH asserts that every well-ordering of\nthe reals has order type less than \u21352. For a given\npointclass \u0393 in the hierarchy, the corresponding definable\nwell-ordering version of CH asserts that every well-ordering (coded by\na set) in \u0393 has order type less than \u21352. \n Again, axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms\nimply this version of CH for richer notions of definability. For\nexample, if ADL(\u211d) holds then this version of CH\nholds for all sets of real numbers in L(\u211d). And if there is a\nproper class of Woodin cardinals then this version of CH holds for all\nuniversally Baire sets of reals. \n2.1.3 Surjection Version\nThe third version formulation of CH asserts that there is no\nsurjection \u03c1 : \u211d \u2192 \u21352, or,\nequivalently, that there is no prewellordering of \u211d of length\n\u21352. For a given pointclass \u0393 in the hierarchy\nof definability, the corresponding surjection version of CH asserts\nthat there is no surjection \u03c1 : \u211d \u2192 \u21352 \nsuch that (the code for) \u03c1 is in \u0393. \n Here the situation is more interesting. Axioms of definable\ndeterminacy and large cardinal axioms have bearing on this version\nsince they place bounds on how long definable prewellorderings can\nbe. Let \n\u03b4\u03301n\nbe the supremum of the lengths of the\n\u03a3\u03301n-prewellorderings\nof reals and let \u0398L(\u211d) be the supremum of the\nlengths of prewellorderings of reals where the prewellordering is\ndefinable in the sense of being in L(\u211d). It is a classical\nresult that \u03b4\u033011 =\n\u21351. Martin showed that \u03b4\u033012\n\u2264 \u21352 and that if there is a measurable cardinal\nthen \u03b4\u033013\n\u2264 \u21353. Kunen and Martin also showed under PD,\n\u03b4\u033014\n\u2264 \u21354 and Jackson showed that under PD, for each n\n< \u03c9, \u03b4\u03301n\n< \u2135\u03c9. Thus, assuming that there are\ninfinitely many Woodin cardinals, these bounds hold. Moreover, the\nbounds continue to hold regardless of the size of\n2\u21350. Of course, the question is whether these\nbounds can be improved to show that the prewellorderings are shorter\nthan \u21352. In 1986 Foreman and Magidor initiated a\nprogram to establish this. In the most general form they aimed to show\nthat large cardinal axioms implied that this version of CH held for\nall universally Baire sets of reals. \n2.1.4 Potential Bearing on CH\nNotice that in the context of ZFC, these three hierarchies of\nversions of CH are all successive approximations of CH and in the\nlimit case, where \u0393 is the pointclass of all sets of reals, they\nare equivalent to CH. The question is whether these approximations can\nprovide any insight into CH itself. \n There is an asymmetry that was pointed out by Martin, namely, that\na definable counterexample to CH is a real counterexample, while no\nmatter how far one proceeds in verifying definable versions of CH at\nno stage will one have touched CH itself. In other words, the\ndefinability approach could refute CH but it could not prove it. \n Still, one might argue that although the definability approach\ncould not prove CH it might provide some evidence for it. In the case\nof the first two versions we now know that CH holds for all definable\nsets. Does this provide evidence of CH? Martin pointed out (before the\nfull results were known) that this is highly doubtful since in each\ncase one is dealing with sets that are atypical. For example, in the\nfirst version, at each stage one secures the definable version of CH\nby showing that all sets in the definability class have the perfect\nset property; yet such sets are atypical in that assuming AC it is\neasy to show that there are sets without this property. In the second\nversion, at each stage one actually shows not only that each\nwell-ordering of reals in the definability class has ordertype less\nthan \u21352, but also that it has ordertype less than\n\u21351. So neither of these versions really illuminates\nCH. \n The third version actually has an advantage in this regard since\nnot all of the sets it deals with are atypical. For example, while all\n\u03a3\u033011-sets\nhave length less than \u21351, there are\n\u03a0\u033011-sets\nof length \u21351. Of course, it could turn out that\neven if the Foreman-Magidor program were to succeed the sets could\nturn out to be atypical in another sense, in which case it would shed\nlittle light on CH. More interesting, however, is the possibility that\nin contrast to the first two versions, it would actually provide an\nactual counterexample to CH. This, of course, would require the\nfailure of the Foreman-Magidor program. \n",
