    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n5. Metaphysics\n\nPhilosophy is a science of possible and actual reality. According to\nWolff\u2019s own taxonomy, theoretical philosophy is divided into\nthree separate branches: ontology (or metaphysics proper),\nspecial metaphysics, and physics. Cosmology, as a branch of\nmetaphysics, is a special or restricted science insofar as its subject\nmatter deals with the \u201cworld-whole\u201d rather than\n\u201cbeing in general\u201d (the subject matter of ontology).\nAlthough there is an important sense for Wolff in which ontology is\nrelevant for, and even necessarily grounds cosmology and the other\nspecial sciences, cosmology (itself) stands in a grounding\nrelationship to physics that is, yet again, a more narrow and\nspecialized discipline (Cosm. \u00a7121). Just as there are certain\nprinciples and certain truths established in ontology that are\nrelevant for cosmology, there are certain principles and certain\ntruths established in cosmology that are relevant for the more\nspecialized science of physics. In fact, within Wolff\u2019s system\nthere is complete uniformity from the top-down (so to speak), so that\neven principles of ontology are relevant for the discipline of\nphysics.\n",
