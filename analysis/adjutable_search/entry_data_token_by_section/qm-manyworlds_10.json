However, even if there is no probability\nin the MWI, it is possible to explain our illusion of apparent\nprobabilistic events. Due to the identity of the mathematical\ncounterparts of worlds, we should not expect any difference between\nour experience in a particular world of the MWI and the experience in\na single-world universe with collapse at every quantum\nmeasurement.\n",
