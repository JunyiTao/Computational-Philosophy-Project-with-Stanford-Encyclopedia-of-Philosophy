Politics, Part Two: Defective Constitutions\n\n\nThe best human life is ruled by knowledge and especially knowledge of\nwhat goodness is and of what is good for human beings. So, too, is \nthe best city. For Plato, philosophers make the ideal rulers for two \nmain reasons. First, they know what is good. Second, they do not want\nto rule (esp. 520e\u2013521b). The problem with existing cities is \ncorrespondingly twofold. They are ruled by people who are ignorant of\nwhat is good, and they suffer from strife among citizens all of whom \nwant to rule. These flaws are connected: the ignorant are \nmarked by their desire for the wrong objects, such as honor and \nmoney, and this desire is what leads them to seek political power. \nAll existing regimes, whether ruled by one, a few, or many, \nshow these defects. So in the Republic Socrates does not \ndistinguish between good and bad forms of these three kinds of \nregime, as the Stranger does in the Plato\u2019s Statesman \n(301a\u2013303b, cf. Aristotle, Politics III 7).\n\n\nNonetheless, Socrates has much to say in Books Eight and Nine about\nthe individual character of various defective regimes. He organizes\nhis account to emphasize appetite\u2019s corrupting power, showing how each\ndefective regime can, through the corruption of the rulers\u2019 appetites,\ndevolve into a still worse one (Hitz 2010, Johnstone 2011). In the timocracy, for example, nothing\nchecks the rulers from taking money to be a badge of honor and feeding\ntheir appetites, which grow in private until they cannot be hidden\nanymore. The account is thus deeply informed by psychology. It does\nnot purport to be an account of what has happened (despite Aristotle\u2019s\ntreatment of it in Politics V 12), any more than Books Two\nthrough Seven purport to give an historical account of an ideal city\u2019s\ngenesis. It is not, for all that, ahistorical, for Plato\u2019s concerns\nabout corruption are clearly informed by his experiences and his\nunderstanding of history. The account, psychologically and\nhistorically informed, does not offer any hint of psychological or\nhistorical determinism. Socrates does not identify the transitions\nfrom one defective regime to the next as inevitable, and he explicitly\nallows for transitions other than the ones he highlights. This is just\none story one could tell about defective regimes. But this particular\nstory is valuable as a morality tale: it highlights the defective\nregimes\u2019 vulnerability to the corruption of the rulers\u2019 appetites.\n\n\nThe political psychology of Books Eight and Nine raises a host of \nquestions, especially about the city-soul analogy (see \n section 1.3\n above). Is the account of political change dependent upon the account\nof psychological change, or vice versa? Or if this is a case of \nmutual interdependence, exactly what accounts for the various \ndependencies? It seems difficult to give just one answer to these \nquestions that will explain all of the claims in these books, and the\nfull, complex theory that must underlie all of the claims is by no \nmeans clear.\n\n\nBut those questions should not obscure the political critiques that\nSocrates offers. First, he criticizes the oligarchs of Athens and\nSparta. His list of five regimes departs from the usual list of rule\nby one, rule by a few, and rule by many (cf.  338d) because he\ndistinguishes among three different regimes in which only a few\nrule. He contrasts the ideal city, in which the wise rule, and two\nwould-be aristocracies, the timocracy in which the militaristically\n\u201cvirtuous\u201d rule and the oligarchy in which the rich\nrule. Socrates argues that these are not genuine aristocracies,\nbecause neither timocracy nor oligarchy manages to check the greed\nthat introduces injustice and strife into cities. This highlights the\ndeficiencies of the Spartan oligarchy, with its narrow attention to\nvalor (cf. Laws, esp. Books One and Two), and of the Athenian\noligarchs, many of whom pursued their own material interests narrowly,\nhowever much they eyed Sparta as a model. So the\nRepublic distances Plato from oligarchic parties of his time\nand place.\n\n\nSecond, Socrates criticizes the Athenian democracy, as Adeimantus\nremarks (563d). Many readers think that Socrates goes over the top in\nhis description, but the central message is not so easy to\ndismiss. Socrates argues that without some publicly entrenched\nstandards for evaluation guiding the city, chaos and strife are\nunavoidable. Even the timocracy and oligarchy, for all their flaws,\nhave public standards for value. But democracy honors all pursuits\nequally, which opens the city to conflict and disorder.\n\n\nSome readers find a silver lining in this critique. They note that \nthe democracy\u2019s tolerance extends to philosophers (cf. 561c\u2013d), \nallowing such things as the conversation that Socrates, Glaucon, and \nthe others are having (557d). But the Republic also records considerable \nskepticism about democratic tolerance of philosophers (487a\u2013499a, cf.\n517a), and does not say that only a democracy could tolerate philosophers.\n\n\nStill, some readers have tried to bring \nthe Republic\u2019s judgment of democracy into line with the \nStatesman, where the Stranger ranks democracy above \noligarchy. I doubt that Socrates explicit ranking in the Republic should count for less than some imagined implicit ranking, but we might still wonder what to make of the apparent contrast between the Republic and Statesman. Perhaps the difference is insignificant, since both democracies and oligarchies are beset by the same essential\nstrife between the rich (oligarchs) and poor (democrats)\n(422e\u2013423a). Perhaps, too, the Republic and Statesman\nappear to disagree only because Plato has different criteria in\nview. Or perhaps he just changed his mind. The ideal city of\nthe Laws, which Plato probably wrote shortly after\nthe Statesman, accords a greater political role for unwise\ncitizens than the Republic does (see\n Plato: on utopia).\n \n",
