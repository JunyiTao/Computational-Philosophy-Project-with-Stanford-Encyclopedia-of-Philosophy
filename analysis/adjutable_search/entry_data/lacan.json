    "main_text": "\n1. Historical Overview\n\nMedically trained as a psychiatrist, Lacan\u2019s first texts started\nappearing in the late 1920s (during the course of his psychiatric\nstudies), with his publishing activity really taking off in the\nsubsequent decade. The 1930s see several early Lacanian milestones:\nthe publication, in 1932, of his doctoral thesis in psychiatry, De\nla psychose parano\u00efaque dans ses rapports avec la\npersonnalit\u00e9 (On Paranoid Psychosis in its Relations with\nthe Personality); collaborations with the Surrealist and Dadaist\nartistic movements in whose midsts he circulated as a familiar fellow\ntraveler; entry into analytic training, including a didactic analysis\nwith Rudolph Lowenstein; attendance at Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve\u2019s\nrenowned seminars on G.W.F. Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of\nSpirit; the first presentation of the now-famous theory of the\n\u201cmirror stage\u201d at the International Psychoanalytic\nAssociation (IPA) conference at Marienbad in 1936 (a presentation\ntruncated by Freud\u2019s friend and biographer, then-IPA President\nErnest Jones); and, the appearance, in the Encyclop\u00e9die\nfran\u00e7aise in 1938, of a substantial essay on a sizable\nswathe of analytic topics entitled Les complexes familiaux dans la\nformation de l\u2019individu: Essai d\u2019analyse d\u2019une\nfonction en psychologie (\u201cThe Family Complexes in the\nFormation of the Individual: Attempt at an Analysis of a Function in\nPsychology\u201d). This crucial period of Lacan\u2019s development,\nas the immediately preceding already indicates, was marked by the\ncollision of interests and influences related to psychoanalysis,\npsychiatry, philosophy, art, and literature, among other areas. More\nspecifically, the robustly interdisciplinary combination that came\ntogether for Lacan at this time of Freudian analysis, Hegelian\ndialectics, Koj\u00e8vian pedagogy, and different experiences of\n\u201cmadness\u201d from numerous perspectives indelibly colors and\npermanently inflects the entire rest of Lacan\u2019s intellectual\nitinerary.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Second World War was, for Lacan (and, of course,\nfor history generally), a period of disruption and upheaval. His\npsychoanalytic activities were interrupted, including his training\nanalysis (Lowenstein and Lacan did not concur about whether this\nanalysis was well and truly completed, with Lacan deciding it was over\nand, somewhat controversially, never returning to Lowenstein\u2019s\ncouch). The War provided Lacan with an exposure to military psychiatry\nin both France and England, with his five-week visit to the latter\nacquainting him with aspects of the British psychoanalytic world\n(features of this visit are recounted in \u201cBritish Psychiatry and\nthe War\u201d [1947]). A handful of important texts were composed\nduring and after the War, all of which eventually got reprinted in\nLacan\u2019s magnum opus, \u00c9crits (1966):\n\u201cLogical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty: A New\nSophism\u201d (1945); \u201cPresentation on Psychical\nCausality\u201d (1946); \u201cAggressiveness in\nPsychoanalysis\u201d (1948); and \u201cThe Mirror Stage as Formative\nof the I Function as Revealed in Psychoanalytic\nExperience\u201d (delivered in 1949 at the IPA conference in\nZurich\u2014whereas the 1936 version from Marienbad is lost, this\nversion is the surviving one made canonical through its inclusion in\n\u00c9crits).\n\nThe next decade was pivotal in Lacan\u2019s trajectory, the time when\nhe fully came into his own as a leading analytic thinker of great\noriginality and immense import. A veritable explosion of Lacanian\nmaterial was unleashed during this period, including seven annual\nseminars and many of the most celebrated essays subsequently collected\nin the nine-hundred-page \u00c9crits (a number of these\nwere hyper-condensed distillations of the results of the annual\nseminars). At the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, Lacan\nbecame initiated into and conversant with the structuralism of\nFerdinand de Saussure and his inheritors such as Claude\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss and Roman Jakobson. L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s\n1949 book The Elementary Structures of Kinship helped launch\nthe French structuralist movement that flourished during the 1950s and\n1960s, an orientation that challenged the theoretical primacy of\nexistentialism in France. L\u00e9vi-Strauss\n\u201cstructuralized\u201d anthropology, as Roland Barthes did for\nliterary-cultural studies and Louis Althusser for Marxism. Up through\nthe end of the 1950s\u2014in 1959\u20131960, a fundamental\nreorienting shift arguably occurred in Lacan\u2019s\nthinking\u2014Lacan fairly can be portrayed as likewise\nstructuralizing Freudian psychoanalysis. He did so under the banner of\na \u201creturn to Freud\u201d according to which, as his most famous\ndictum has it, \u201cthe unconscious is structured like a\nlanguage\u201d (l\u2019inconscient est structur\u00e9 comme un\nlangage). Lacan portrayed himself as the lone defender of a\nFreudian orthodoxy in danger of being eclipsed by its alleged\nabandonment and betrayal in the post-Freudian analytic universe,\nparticularly Anglo-American ego psychology as consolidated by the\ntroika of Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Kris, and Lacan\u2019s former analyst\nLowenstein. Lacan adamantly maintained that a Saussurian-assisted\nrecovery of the overriding significance of language for analysis both\nclinical and metapsychological is the key to faithfully carrying\nforward Freud\u2019s revolutionary approach to psychical\nsubjectivity. All of this was announced in detail in the lengthy\nfounding manifesto of Lacanianism, the 1953 \u00e9crit\n\u201cThe Function and Field of Speech and Language in\nPsychoanalysis\u201d (often referred to as the \u201cRome\nDiscourse\u201d because of where it was delivered). This manifesto\ncoincided with Lacan\u2019s participation in an exodus from his\nformer analytic institute, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Parisienne de\nPsychanalyse (SPP), and the founding of a new institute, the\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Psychanalyse (SFP). The\nSPP\u2019s move to a medicalized model of analytic training (as per\nthe scientistic psychiatric paradigm that was dominant in the\ninstitutes of the English-speaking world) was one of the main\nprecipitators of the departure of the breakaway faction that founded\nthe SFP.\n\nAlso in 1953, Lacan conducted his first annual seminar addressing\nFreud\u2019s Papers on Technique (1953\u20131954). Lacan\ncontinued giving these right up until shortly before his death, with\nle S\u00e9minaire running continuously for twenty-seven\nyears. As was the case with Koj\u00e8ve, Lacan exerted his influence\nprimarily through his oral teachings. The first decade of le\nS\u00e9minaire (1953\u20131963) was taught at the\nH\u00f4pital Sainte-Anne and had an audience consisting mostly of\npsychoanalysts. For reasons I will explain shortly, Lacan, in 1964,\nmoved his seminar first to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure\n(1964\u20131969) and then to the Faculty of Law across from the\nPanth\u00e9on (1969\u20131980). From 1964 onwards, Lacan\u2019s\naudience startlingly increased in both sheer numbers and breadth of\nbackgrounds, with artists and academics from various disciplines\nacross academia joining the more clinically-minded attendees. Le\nS\u00e9minaire became a nodal Parisian intellectual\ninstitution, a kind of hub attracting some of the brightest stars of\nthe post-War French cultural firmament. For instance, such\nphilosophers as Jean Hyppolite, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Luce\nIrigaray, and Julia Kristeva spent time in Lacan\u2019s audience. In\nhis seminars, Lacan deftly maneuvered within and between a multitude\nof theoretical currents, putting psychoanalysis into conversation with\nthe history of philosophy, phenomenology, existentialism,\nstructuralism, post-structuralism, feminism, and, as already\nindicated, just about every discipline represented in the university.\nAll of the major French philosophers of the generation that came of\nage in the 1960s and 1970s engaged with Freudian analysis in one way\nor another, and all of them did so in fashions varyingly informed by\nLacan\u2019s teachings.\n\nThe 1960s were a highly productive and equally tumultuous era in\nLacan\u2019s history. In his seventh seminar on The Ethics of\nPsychoanalysis (1959\u20131960), Lacan took a sort of turn\nfateful for the direction of his later trajectory, initiating an\ninterrogation of the ways in which language was privileged by his\n1950s \u201creturn to Freud.\u201d The immediately prior years\ntirelessly emphasized the essential role of the register of the\nSymbolic, namely, the pride of place of analytically modified versions\nof Saussurian signifiers in the structures and dynamics of the\nunconscious and speaking subjectivity (in the 1930s and 1940s, the\nphenomenal-visual register of the Imaginary was to the fore thanks to\nthe focus on the mirror stage). At the end of the 1950s, with the rise\nof the Real as the register of a new focus of Lacan\u2019s\nthinking\u2014I will say more about Lacan\u2019s tripartite register\ntheory subsequently (see\n 2.1\n below)\u2014things and phenomena escaping, resisting, or thwarting\nthe signifying powers of the socio-linguistic symbolic order became\never more central in Lacanian theory. These things and phenomena\ninclude Otherness, drives, jouissance, and objet petit\na, among other Lacanian concepts (see\n 2.3,\n 2.4.2, and\n 2.4.3\n below). This 1959\u20131960 seminar defensibly can be depicted as a\nprescient post-structuralist text avant la lettre.\n\nAn earthquake in Lacan\u2019s professional and personal histories hit\nhim in 1963. For ten years (1953\u20131963), the SFP, following its\ncreation after the defections from the SPP, was being scrutinized at\nlength by the IPA as a training institute applying for IPA membership.\nTo cut a long story short, the IPA ended up offering the SFP an\nultimatum: It could be admitted only if Lacan was struck from its list\nof training analysts. Lacan\u2019s non-standard\n\u201cvariable-length sessions,\u201d deviating from the\nfixed-length session rules of IPA orthodoxy, was the main reason for\nthe IPA\u2019s withholding of its recognition from him. The SFP\naccepted this condition, stripping Lacan of his standing within it. In\nthe aftermath of what he understandably experienced as a deeply\nwounding betrayal, he abandoned his original plans for a\n1963\u20131964 seminar on The Names-of-the-Father (only its\nopening session of November 20, 1963 was given), relocated his\nteaching from the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Anne to the \u00c9cole\nNormale Sup\u00e9rieure, and conducted his deservedly renowned\neleventh seminar of 1964, The Four Fundamental Concepts of\nPsychoanalysis (with Lacan identifying these four concepts as the\nunconscious, repetition, the transference, and the drive). This\nseminar\u2019s opening session involved Lacan discussing his\nSFP-brokered \u201cexcommunication\u201d from the IPA, with him\ncomparing himself to Baruch Spinoza and the latter\u2019s expulsion\nfrom the Jewish community for being a heretic. However traumatic this\nblow, it seemed to prompt Lacan to come even more into his own, to\nforge a distinctly Lacanian battery of ideas and terms\u2014and this\nby contrast with the more familiar Freudian language and apparatus of\nthe first decade of le S\u00e9minaire (1953\u20131963).\nAlthough not without many precedents in his prior work, a Lacanianism\ndistinct from Freudianism began to emerge clearly into view in the\nmid-1960s. In the shadow of his rejection by the IPA and departure\nfrom the SFP, Lacan founded his own analytic organization, the\n\u00c9cole freudienne de Paris. This new institutional framework\n(and freedom) provided him with a setting in which to experiment with\nnovel approaches to analytic teaching and training.\n\nIn 1966, Lacan\u2019s hulking tome \u00c9crits was\npublished by \u00c9ditions du Seuil. Prior to this, Lacan had\npublished only a single book, his thesis in psychiatry (1932). The\nnine-hundred-page \u00c9crits gathered together many of\nLacan\u2019s most important articles and essays into a single volume,\ncovering a thirty-year stretch from 1936 to 1966. These\n\u201cwritings\u201d provide very daunting and demanding paths of\nentry into Lacanian thinking (the annual seminars are comparatively\nmore reader-friendly and transparent). Although the\n\u00c9crits bear no small portion of responsibility for\nLacan\u2019s reputation as a \u201cdifficult\u201d (if not\ndeliberately obscurantist) thinker, this book became a bestseller upon\nits initial release in France. Its success elevated Lacan into his\nfame as the French Freud in the eyes of France\u2019s reading public.\nDuring this time, Lacan\u2019s audience for le\nS\u00e9minaire continued to swell, with his influence growing\nto cover ever-wider circles of Paris-centered intellectual and\ncultural life.\n\nThroughout his career, Lacan exhibited a serious interest in various\nbranches of mathematical and formal disciplines. This goes as far back\nas the 1940s, with the recourse to game theory in \u201cLogical Time\nand the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty.\u201d The turn to\nstructuralism at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s\nreinforced these formalistic tendencies, with Lacan, in the 1950s,\nalready drawing upon not only game theory, L\u00e9vi-Straussian\nanthropology, and Jakobsonian phonology, but also the history of\nmathematics and topology. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, more and\nmore diagrams, graphs, and symbolizations appeared peppered throughout\nLacan\u2019s lectures and writings, testifying to a steadily\nintensifying trend toward formalization. By the late 1960s and,\nespecially, the 1970s, discussions of logic, topology, and knot theory\nwere prominent (sometimes even dominant) features of Lacanian\ndiscourse. In relation to Lacan, the 1970s could be characterized as\nthe decade of the \u201cmatheme,\u201d Lacan\u2019s neologism for a\nunit of formalization (qua a mathematical-style\nsymbolization) distilling and fixing the core significance of a\nspecific Lacanian analytic concept-term. Lacan hoped thereby to avoid\nbeing misinterpreted in the ways that Freud\u2019s deceptively\naccessible employments of natural language allegedly allowed most\nnon-Lacanian post-Freudians to perpetrate. Additionally, topology, as\na science of surfaces, provided Lacan with resources for his regular\nassaults on the crude, popular images of psychoanalysis as a\n\u201cdepth psychology,\u201d with these images relying upon the\nsimplistic two- and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces of spontaneous\npicture thinking. Topological figures and constructions undermining\nthe intuitions of this picture thinking assisted Lacan in recasting\nthe unconscious as an ensemble of contortions, curvings, folding,\ninflections, twists, and turns immanent and internal to a single plane\nof minded subjectivity accessible to rigorous, rational\n(psycho)analysis.\n\nIn addition to the pursuit of formalization via mathemes, the seminars\nof the final decade of Lacan\u2019s teachings also were preoccupied\nwith reflections on his register theory, especially the register of\nthe Real, and sexual difference (reflections often intertwined with\neach other). The program of formalization ostensibly enabled Lacan to\nreveal with exactitude the precise limits of the sayable and the\nrepresentable, thereby touching upon the Real through showing what is\nnot pinned down fully and adequately within the coordinates of the\naccessible, familiar \u201creality\u201d co-constituted through the\nother two registers of the Imaginary and the Symbolic (see\n 2.1\n below). Various aspects and facets of things sexual came to be\nassociated by the later Lacan with the enigmatic evasiveness of the\nReal, including sexual difference. In one of his most famous seminars,\nthe twentieth (Encore, 1972\u20131973), he theorized sexual\ndifference as \u201csexuation,\u201d depicting the non-biological,\ndenaturalized subject-positions of masculinity and femininity in terms\nof formal logic. Therein, he purported to uncover an inherent,\nineliminable structural discrepancy/gap separating the sexes, an\ninescapable condemnation of sexed subjects to being essentially,\nnecessarily out-of-sync with each other (and even with themselves as\nsplit subjects). Lacan summarized this with an infamous one-liner:\n\u201cIl n\u2019y a pas de rapport sexuel\u201d (There is\nno sexual relationship). This declaration scandalized many at the\ntime. Moreover, the twentieth seminar in particular as well as\nconnected portions of Lacan\u2019s corpus from this same period\nserved as powerful catalysts for crucial developments in French\nfeminist thinking during the 1970s.\n\nIn 1980, near the end of his life, Lacan saw fit to disband his\nschool, the \u00c9cole freudienne. This decision was controversial\nand triggered factional infighting amongst his followers. Lacan died\nin 1981. His son-in-law and editor of le S\u00e9minaire,\nJacques-Alain Miller\u2014when he was a student of Althusser\u2019s\nat the ENS, Miller met Lacan for the first time in 1964 as an attendee\nof Lacan\u2019s eleventh seminar\u2014founded the \u00c9cole de la\nCause freudienne as a successor to the \u00c9cole freudienne on the\nheels of the latter\u2019s \u201cdissolution.\u201d Miller has\nsince retained publishing control over Lacan\u2019s texts, editing\nthe Champ freudien book series in which official\n\u201cestablished\u201d versions of the annual seminars and other\nLacanian writings appear.\n\n2. Fundamental Concepts\n2.1 Register Theory\n\nThe theory of the three registers of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and\nthe Real forms the skeletal framework for the various concepts and\nphases of most of Lacan\u2019s intellectual itinerary. His\ncharacterizations of each of the three registers, as well as of their\nrelations with each other, undergo multiple revisions and shifts over\nthe many years of his labors. As will become increasingly evident in\nwhat follows, the majority of Lacanian concepts are defined in\nconnection with all three registers. By the 1970s, with his\nmeditations on the topological figure of the Borromean knot\u2014this\nknotting of three rings, pictured on the coat of arms of the Borromeo\nfamily, is arranged such that if one ring is broken, all three are set\nfree in disconnection\u2014Lacan emphasizes the mutual dependence of\nthe registers on one another. Hence, loosely speaking, the Imaginary,\nthe Symbolic, and the Real can be thought of as the three fundamental\ndimensions of psychical subjectivity \u00e0 la Lacan.\nFurthermore, scholars sometimes segment Lacan\u2019s evolution into\nthree main periods, with each period being distinguished by the\npriority of one of the registers: the early Lacan of the Imaginary\n(1930s and 1940s), the middle Lacan of the Symbolic (1950s), and the\nlate Lacan of the Real (1960s and 1970s). However, such a neat and\nclean periodization should be taken with several grains of salt, since\nintricate continuities and discontinuities not conforming to this\nearly-middle-late schema are to be found across the entire lengthy\nspan of Lacan\u2019s teachings.\n2.1.1 The Imaginary\n\nLacan tends to associate (albeit not exclusively) the Imaginary with\nthe restricted spheres of consciousness and self-awareness. It is the\nregister with the closest links to what people experience as\nnon-psychoanalytic quotidian reality. Who and what one\n\u201cimagines\u201d other persons to be, what one thereby\n\u201cimagines\u201d they mean when communicatively interacting, who\nand what one \u201cimagines\u201d oneself to be, including from the\nimagined perspectives of others\u2014all of the preceding is\nencompassed under the heading of this register. Such a description\nindicates the ways in which the Imaginary points to core analytic\nideas like transference, fantasy, and the ego. In particular, the\nImaginary is central to Lacan\u2019s account(s) of ego-formation (as\nper the mirror stage\u2014see\n 2.2\n below).\n\nAs Lacan integrates his early work of the 1930s and 1940s with his\nstructuralism-informed theories of the 1950s, he comes to emphasize\nthe dependence of the Imaginary on the Symbolic. This dependency means\nthat more sensory-perceptual phenomena (images and experiences of\none\u2019s body, affects as consciously lived emotions, envisionings\nof the thoughts and feelings of others, etc.) are shaped, steered, and\n(over)determined by socio-linguistic structures and dynamics. With the\ngrowing importance of the Real in the 1960s and the Borromean knots of\nthe 1970s, it becomes clear that Lacan conceives of the Imaginary as\nbound up with both of the other two registers (incidentally, the\nImaginary and the Symbolic, when taken together as mutually\nintegrated, constitute the field of \u201creality,\u201d itself\ncontrasted with the Real). In fact, it could be maintained that the\nImaginary invariably involves category mistakes. More specifically, it\nis the register in which the other two registers are mistaken for each\nother: What is Real is misrecognized as Symbolic (for example, as in\nparticular sorts of obsessional-neurotic and paranoid-psychotic\nsymptoms, certain meaningless contingent occurrences at the level of\nthe material world of non-human objects are viewed as though they were\nmeaningful signs full of deep significance to be deciphered and\ninterpreted) and what is Symbolic is misrecognized as Real (for\nexample, as in psychosomatic-type \u201cconversion symptoms,\u201d\nunconscious mental conflicts encoded in language and ideas are\nsuffered as bodily afflictions and ailments).\n\nWith his choice of the word \u201cimaginary,\u201d Lacan indeed\nintends to designate that which is fictional, simulated, virtual, and\nthe like. However, the phenomena of the Imaginary are necessary\nillusions (to put it in Kantian locution) or real abstractions (to put\nit in Marxian parlance). This signals two points. First, as one of\nLacan\u2019s three basic, essential registers, the Imaginary is an\nintrinsic, unavoidable dimension of the existences of speaking\npsychical subjects; just as an analysis cannot (and should not try to)\nrid the analysand of his/her unconscious, so too is it neither\npossible nor desirable to liquidate the illusions of this register.\nSecond, the fictional abstractions of the Imaginary, far from being\nmerely \u201cunreal\u201d as ineffective, inconsequential\nepiphenomena, are integral to and have very concrete effects upon\nactual, factual human realities.\n2.1.2 The Symbolic\n\nThe Lacanian Symbolic initially is theorized on the basis of resources\nprovided by structuralism. Tied to natural languages as characterized\nby Saussure and specific post-Saussurians, this register also refers\nto the customs, institutions, laws, mores, norms, practices, rituals,\nrules, traditions, and so on of cultures and societies (with these\nthings being entwined in various ways with language). Lacan\u2019s\nphrase \u201csymbolic order,\u201d which encompasses all of the\npreceding, can be understood as roughly equivalent to what Hegel\ndesignates as \u201cobjective spirit.\u201d This non-natural\nuniverse is an elaborate set of inter-subjective and trans-subjective\ncontexts into which individual human beings are thrown at birth (along\nthe lines of Heideggerian Geworfenheit), a pre-existing order\npreparing places for them in advance and influencing the vicissitudes\nof their ensuing lives.\n\nAccording to Lacan, one of the (if not the) most significant and\nindispensable conditions of possibility for singular subjectivity is\nthe collective symbolic order (sometimes named \u201cthe big\nOther,\u201d a phrase to be unpacked further shortly\u2014see\n 2.3\n below). Individual subjects are what they are in and through the\nmediation of the socio-linguistic arrangements and constellations of\nthe register of the Symbolic. Especially during the period of the\n\u201creturn to Freud,\u201d the analytic unconscious (qua\n\u201cstructured like a language\u201d) is depicted as kinetic\nnetworks of interlinked signifiers (i.e., \u201csignifying\nchains\u201d). Rendered thusly, the unconscious, being of a Symbolic\n(anti-)nature in and of itself, is to be interpretively engaged with\nvia the Symbolic medium of speech, namely, the very substance of the\nbeing-in-itself of the speaking subject (parl\u00eatre) of\nthe unconscious. Furthermore, the Lacanian unconscious is structured\nlike \u201cun langage\u201d and not \u201cune\nlangue.\u201d Although both French words translate into English\nas \u201clanguage,\u201d the former (langage) refers to\nlogics and structures of syntax and semantics not necessarily specific\nto particular natural languages, whereas the latter (langue),\nwhich also could be translated into English as \u201ctongue,\u201d\ndoes refer to the notion of a natural language. Hence, Lacan is not\nsaying that the unconscious is structured like French, German,\nEnglish, Spanish, or any other particular natural language.\n\nAlthough the register of the Symbolic comes to the fore only with\nLacan\u2019s structuralist phase of the 1950s, it arguably is not\nwithout its precursors in his earlier texts. Already in 1938, the idea\nof the \u201ccomplex\u201d in the encyclopedia article on \u201cThe\nFamily Complexes\u201d anticipates how Lacan recasts the Freudian\nOedipus complex via L\u00e9vi-Straussian structural anthropology.\nSimilarly, the prisoners\u2019 dilemma scenario narrated in\n1945\u2019s \u201cLogical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated\nCertainty\u201d illustrates how a formal, game-theoretic apparatus\ngoverns the lived experiences of subjects inserted into it. Moreover,\nthe 1949 \u00e9crit on \u201cThe Mirror Stage\u201d hints\nat the enabling background presence of a socio-symbolic milieu\n(incarnated first and foremost by parental caregivers) as the trigger\nprompting the child\u2019s identification with mirrored images of\nhim/her-self (as I will discuss subsequently here, this hint is\nexpanded and embellished upon by Lacan in 1960s-era revisions of the\nmirror stage\u2014see\n 2.2\n below).\n\nDespite the rise to prominence of the register of the Real beginning\naround 1959\u20131960, the Symbolic continues to play pivotal roles\nin Lacan\u2019s teachings right up until the start of the 1980s. For\ninstance, in Seminar XVII (1969\u20131970) and the\ncontemporaneous interview \u201cRadiophonie,\u201d Lacan\nforges his theory of the \u201cfour discourses\u201d (those of the\n\u201cmaster\u201d, \u201cuniversity,\u201d\n\u201chysteric,\u201d and \u201canalyst\u201d) to reflect the\ninterlinked permutations of multiple kinds of \u201csocial\nlinks\u201d configuring the relations between speaking subjects. More\ngenerally, the later Lacan remains reliant on the notion of the Real\nsides of the Symbolic, these being signifiers in their meaningless,\nnonsensical materiality as visible marks and audible sounds (i.e.,\n\u201cletters\u201d in Lacan\u2019s technical sense)\u2014and this\nby contrast with the Imaginary sides of the Symbolic, in which\nsignifiers are paired with signifieds to form meaningful, significant\nsigns (\u00e0 la Saussure\u2019s classic explanation of\nsuccessful communication via natural language). Such senseless\nsignifiers and their enchainings amount to a late Lacanian rendition\nof Freudian primary processes as the thinking distinctive of\nunconscious mindedness.\n\nWhen Lacan mentions \u201cstructure,\u201d a word to which he has\nfrequent recourse, he usually is thinking of his register of the\nSymbolic. Between the periods of his \u201creturn to Freud\u201d and\nlater teachings, Lacan reconsiders and alters what is conceptualized\nunder the heading of the \u201clike a language\u201d (comme un\nlangage) part of his fundamental claim that, \u201cthe\nunconscious is structured like a language.\u201d However, from the\n1950s until his death, his specific rendition of Freud\u2019s\ndiscovery consistently holds to the thesis that, \u201cthe\nunconscious is structured.\u201d That is to say, the unconscious, as\nbound up with that which is Symbolic, is an intricate, labyrinthine\nweb of ideational representations interconnected in multiple\nsophisticated manners. Contrary to the crudeness of commonplace vulgar\npicturings of Freudian analysis as an irrationalist, neo-romantic\npsychology of the unruly natural depths, the unconscious is not the\nid, namely, an anarchic seething cauldron of unthinking animalistic\ninstincts (i.e., something unstructured).\n2.1.3 The Real\n\nThe register of the Real is tricky to encapsulate and evades being\npinned down through succinct definitions. Lacan\u2019s numerous and\nshifting pronouncements apropos the Real are themselves partly\nresponsible for this absence of straightforwardness. But, rather than\nbeing just a barrier to grasping the Real, this absence is itself\nrevelatory of this register. To be more precise, as that which is\nforeign to Imaginary-Symbolic reality\u2014this reality is the realm\ncontaining conscious apprehension, communicable significance, and the\nlike\u2014the Real is intrinsically elusive, resisting by nature\ncapture in the comprehensibly meaningful formulations of\nconcatenations of Imaginary-Symbolic signs. It is, as Lacan stresses\nagain and again, an \u201cimpossibility\u201d\nvis-\u00e0-vis reality.\n\nLacan\u2019s earliest employments of the term \u201cReal\u201d use\nit to refer to material being(s) an sich, namely, to physical\nexistents handled as roughly equivalent to Kant\u2019s\nthings-in-themselves. The Real hence would be whatever is beyond,\nbehind, or beneath phenomenal appearances accessible to the direct\nexperiences of first-person awareness. This characterization of the\nReal persists into the first versions of Lacan\u2019s mature register\ntheory as initially elaborated throughout the 1950s. During this\ndecade of the \u201creturn to Freud,\u201d the Real also gets\nconnected to Lacan\u2019s contemporaneously emerging conceptions of\npsychosis and Otherness (the latter to be addressed soon\u2014see\n 2.3\n below). Additionally, in the 1950s, Lacan tends to speak of the Real\nas an absolute fullness, a pure plenum devoid of the negativities of\nabsences, antagonisms, gaps, lacks, splits, etc. Portrayed thusly, the\nSymbolic is primarily responsible for injecting such negativities into\nthe Real. For instance, only though the powers of language can\nmaterial being in itself be said to be \u201cmissing\u201d things,\nsince, on its own, this dimension of being always is simply whatever\nit is in its dumb, idiotic presence as never more and never less than\nsheer, indifferent plenitude.\n\nAs I noted above, the seventh seminar of 1959\u20131960 marks a shift\naway from the privileging of the Symbolic over the course of the 1950s\nand toward prioritizing the Real. The Real prior to Seminar\nVII tends to be depicted in non-dialectical and/or quasi-Kantian\nterms. Although Kant is one of the main explicit foci during this\nacademic year, Lacan\u2019s sustained reformulation of the Real in\nthis seminar introduces quasi-Hegelian dialectical features into it,\nthereby nuancing and complicating his ideas about this register. The\nnew Real involves convergences of opposites as a register of volatile\noscillations and unstable reversals between excesses and lacks,\nsurpluses and deficits, flooding presences and draining absences. In\nthe seventh seminar, Lacan puts forward the figure of the mother as\nthe key analytic referent justifying this rendition of the Real (a\nfigure he relates to another figure, that of \u201cthe Lady\u201d in\nthe courtly love tradition). In the beginning of the\npsychical-libidinal subject\u2019s ontogentic life history, the\nmaternal caretaker is, at one and the same time, both overwhelmingly,\nstiflingly present or near and, in her strange, impenetrable alterity,\nalso frustratingly, uncontrollably absent or inaccessible; there is\neither too much or too little of her, never the right balanced amount.\nWith the passage of time and the temporal transformations of the\nlibidinal economy, the mother, as this archaic Real Other, becomes the\nforever unattainable \u201cSovereign Good,\u201d the fixed vanishing\npoint, of all desiring (what Lacan calls, in dialogue with the history\nof philosophy as well as Freud, \u201cdas Ding\u201d\n[la Chose, the Thing]).\n\nThroughout the 1960s and up through the end of Lacan\u2019s\nteachings, the Real takes on an ever increasing number of aspects and\nconnotations. It becomes both a transcendence troubling and thwarting\nImaginary-Symbolic reality and its language from without as well as an\nimmanence perturbing and subverting reality/language from within. It\ncomes to be associated with libidinal negativities (objet petit\na, jouissance, and sexual difference, all to be\ndiscussed later\u2014see\n 2.3,\n 2.4.2, and\n 2.4.3\n below), material meaninglessness both linguistic (see\n 2.1.2\n above) and non-linguistic, contingent traumatic events, unbearable\nbodily intensities, anxiety, and death.\n\nAs regards the unconscious as the principle concern of psychoanalysis,\nthe later Lacan combines his earlier emphasis on socio-linguistic\nformations (\u00e0 la \u201cthe unconscious is structured\nlike a language\u201d) with a subsequent stress on forces and factors\ninternal but irreducible to these formations. After the 1950s, Real\ndimensions are added to the unconscious, with its Symbolic dimensions\nbeing made to orbit around black holes of unsymbolizability impossible\nto represent via the signifier-like ideational representations\n(Freud\u2019s Vorstellungen) of the language-like sides of\nthe unconscious. Nonetheless, the rise of the Real in Lacan\u2019s\nteachings does not amount to him converting to any sort of analytic\nrecapitulation of mysticisms or negative theologies. Instead, for\nLacan, analysis both theoretical and clinical permits delineating and\ntracking the Real with conceptual precision, if only as an exercise in\npinpointing the exact limits of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and their\noverlappings.\n2.2 The Mirror Stage, the Ego, and the Subject\n\nThe account of the mirror stage is perhaps Lacan\u2019s most famous\ntheoretical contribution (maybe even more famous than the well-known\nthesis apropos the unconscious as \u201cstructured like a\nlanguage\u201d). Initially developed in the 1930s, this account\ninvolves a number of interrelated ingredients. Lacan offers the\nnarrative of this stage as an explanation specifically for the genesis\nand functions of the Freudian psychical agency of the ego\n(Ich, moi). One of the psychoanalytic and\nphilosophical upshots of the mirror stage, a crucial one in\nLacan\u2019s eyes, is that the ego is an object rather than a\nsubject. In other words, the ego, despite conscious senses to the\ncontrary, is not a locus of autonomous agency, the seat of a free,\ntrue \u201cI\u201d determining its own fate. This portrait of the\nego-as-object is at the heart of Lacan\u2019s lifelong critical\npolemics against Anglo-American ego psychology, with the ego\npsychologists seeking to strengthen their patients\u2019 egos by\nappealing to supposed autonomous and \u201cconflict-free\u201d sides\nof these psychical agencies. Against this, Lacan views the ego as\nthoroughly compromised and inherently neurotic to its very core, as a\npassionate defense of a constitutive ignorance of the unconscious.\n\nTo stay at this more general metapsychological level for a little\nwhile longer, Lacan eventually forges, partly on the basis of the\nmirror stage, a distinction between the ego (moi) and the\nsubject (sujet, a word freighted with philosophical\nbaggage\u2014Lacan knowingly adds this word and its philosophical\nvocabulary to analytic discourse, although Freud did not speak of\n\u201cthe subject\u201d and was wary of philosophy). Appearances\nnotwithstanding, the ego is, when all is said and done, an inert,\nfixed bundle of objectified coordinates, a libidinally invested and\nreified entity. By contrast with the ego and the illusory sense of\nfictional selfhood it supports, the psychoanalytic subject of\nLacanianism is an unconscious kinetic negativity defying capture by\nand within ego-level identificatory constructs. The Lacanian\nenunciating subject of the unconscious speaks through the ego while\nremaining irreducibly distinct from it.\n\nReturning to a tighter focus on the mirror stage proper, Lacan,\nrelying on empirical data from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth\ncenturies, posits that very young children, between the ages of six\nand eighteen months, quickly acquire the ability to identify their own\nimages in reflective surfaces. At this time, infants are lacking in\nmost physical and mental abilities possessed by older human beings.\nPrior to Lacan, Freud already highlights how a biologically dictated\nprematurational helplessness (Hilflosigkeit) naturally\npredestines the human being to the predominance of social nurture over\nmaterial nature due to the protracted period of total reliance on\nother persons for one\u2019s life-or-death vital requirements.\nFollowing Freud here, Lacan fleshes out this helplessness into which\nbirth throws neonates, describing in detail the anatomical,\nphysiological, cognitive, emotional, and motivational facets of this\nnatural condition of post-birth prematurity.\n\nThis initial state of helpless \u201cmotor impotence and nursling\ndependence\u201d entails the infant experiencing a swirl of negative\naffects: anxiety, distress, frustration, and so on. To the young\nchild, motivated by these negative affects, a crucial component of the\nenthralling lure exerted by the fascinating image of his/her body is\nthis image\u2019s promise that he/she can overcome his/her\nHilflosigkeit and be a unified, pulled-together whole, an\nintegrated, coordinated totality like the bigger, more mature others\nhe/she sees around him/her-self (however, according to Lacan,\nindividuals spend their entire lives, beginning thusly, chasing in\nvain after an unattainable state of harmony and mastery first falsely\npromised by the mirror). This imago-Gestalt of virtual\nwholeness, identified with by the infant in a jubilant moment of\n\u201cAha!,\u201d lays down the imagistic nucleus of the thereafter\nontogenetically accreting ego as a series of self-objectifications in\nimages and, soon after with the event of language acquisition, words\ntoo.\n\nFor Lacan, identification with the imago-Gestalt of the\nmoi entails alienation\u2014and this for additional reasons\nover and above those given in the preceding paragraphs. Already in the\n1949 \u00e9crit on the mirror stage, mention is made of\n\u201csome prop, human or artificial\u201d supporting the infant as\nhe/she gazes into the mirror and looks at him/her-self. In 1949, Lacan\nseems to think of this prop more as artificial than human, referring\nto the \u201ctrotte-b\u00e9b\u00e9\u201d (walker)\nleaned on by the child. But, in subsequent revisitations of the mirror\nstage during the 1960s, Lacan dramatically highlights the supporting\nrole of fellow human beings instead. In so doing, he argues that the\ninfant is encouraged to identify with the mirror image as\n\u201cme\u201d by verbal and gestural prompts issuing from the\nbigger other(s) holding him/her up in front of the reflective surface\n(for example, the utterance \u201cThat\u2019s you there!\u201d\naccompanied by pointing and grinning). This later shift of emphasis\nhas two crucial consequences. First, the Imaginary register of the\nmirror does not precede the Symbolic register of language and\nsociality in a linear chronology of developmental stages (as the\nearlier text of \u201cThe Mirror Stage\u201d might be at risk of\nsuggesting); if anything, socio-linguistic variables (for instance,\nthe words and body language of parents) are the causal triggers of the\nchild\u2019s investment in select sensory-perceptual experiences\n(such as the body image in the mirror). Second, this means that the\nimagistic nucleus of the ego is suffused from the get-go with the\ndestinal \u201cdiscourse of the Other\u201d\u2014in this case,\nfateful significations (in Lacanese, \u201cunary traits\u201d)\ncoming from caregivers\u2019 narratives articulated simultaneously\nalong with their encouragements to the child to recognize him/her-self\nin the mirror (\u201cWhat a handsome boy!,\u201d \u201cWhat a\nbeautiful girl!,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to grow up to be big\nand strong, just like your daddy,\u201d etc.).\n\nAs a result of all of the above, Lacan considers the recognition that\nhappens in the mirror stage to amount to \u201cmisrecognition\u201d\n(m\u00e9connaissance). This likewise holds throughout life\nfor all ensuing experiences of \u201crecognizing\u201d oneself as\nbeing a particular kind of \u201cI,\u201d namely, taking\nqua imagining oneself to be a certain sort of ego-level self\n(apropos Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis, it always pays to remember\nWilliam Wordsworth\u2019s line, \u201cThe child is the father of the\nman\u201d). The ego is not only a congealed, heteronomous object\nrather than fluid, autonomous subject, but also, in its very origins,\na repository for the projected desires and fantasies of larger others;\nthe child\u2019s image is a receptacle for his/her parents\u2019\ndreams and wishes, with his/her body image being always-already\noverwritten by signifiers flowing from the libidinal economies of\nother speaking beings. Hence, recognizing the ego as \u201cme,\u201d\nas embodying and representing an authentic, private, unique selfhood\nthat is most genuinely my own, is tantamount to misrecognizing that,\nat root, the ego ultimately is an alienating foreign introject through\nwhich I am seduced and subjected by others\u2019 conscious and\nunconscious wants and machinations. To borrow one of Lacan\u2019s\nmany neologisms, the ego ultimately is something\n\u201cextimate\u201d (i.e., intimately exterior, an internal\nexternality) insofar as it crystallizes \u201cthe desire of the\nOther\u201d (qua others\u2019 conscious and unconscious\nwants and machinations). Or, as the Lacan of the eleventh seminar\nwould put it, there is something in the me more than the me itself to\nthe extent that this moi essentially is a coagulation of\ninter-subjective and trans-subjective alien influences.\n\nFinally, Lacan\u2019s utilization of the idea of the mirror is not\nexclusively literal. Although he often talks of mirrors as shiny\nreflective surfaces, he does not limit mirroring to being a visible\nphysical phenomenon alone. Most importantly, other persons\u2019\nspeech, gestures, postures, moods, facial expressions, and so on\nfrequently can be said to \u201cmirror\u201d back to one an\n\u201cimage\u201d of oneself, namely, a conveyed sense of how one\n\u201cappears\u201d from other perspectives.\n2.3 Otherness, the Oedipus Complex, and Sexuation\n\nThroughout his teachings, Lacan regularly utilizes the terms\n\u201cother\u201d (with a lower-case o) and \u201cOther\u201d\n(with a capital O). Given an understanding of Lacan\u2019s register\ntheory and the mirror stage (see\n 2.1\n and\n 2.2\n above), these terms can be clarified with relative ease and brevity.\nThe lower-case-o other designates the Imaginary ego and its\naccompanying alter-egos. By speaking of the ego itself as an\n\u201cother,\u201d Lacan further underscores its alien and\nalienating status as spelled out in the immediately preceding\nsub-section here (see\n 2.2\n above). Additionally, when relating to others as alter-egos, one does\nso on the basis of what one \u201cimagines\u201d about them (often\nimagining them to be \u201clike me,\u201d to share a set of\nlowest-common-denominator thoughts, feelings, and inclinations making\nthem comprehensible to me). These transference-style imaginings are\nfictions taming and domesticating the mysterious, unsettling\nforeignness of one\u2019s conspecifics, thereby rendering social life\ntolerable and navigable.\n\nThe capital-O Other refers to two additional types of otherness\ncorresponding to the registers of the Symbolic and the Real. The first\ntype of Other is Lacan\u2019s \u201cbig Other\u201d qua\nsymbolic order, namely, the overarching \u201cobjective spirit\u201d\nof trans-individual socio-linguistic structures configuring the fields\nof inter-subjective interactions. Relatedly, the Symbolic big Other\nalso can refer to (often fantasmatic/fictional) ideas of anonymous\nauthoritative power and/or knowledge (whether that of God, Nature,\nHistory, Society, State, Party, Science, or the analyst as the\n\u201csubject supposed to know\u201d [sujet suppos\u00e9\nsavoir] as per Lacan\u2019s distinctive account of analytic\ntransference). But, as already becomes evident in Lacan\u2019s first\nfew annual seminars of the early 1950s, there also is a Real dimension\nto Otherness. This particular incarnation of the Real, about which\nLacan goes into greatest detail when addressing both love and\npsychosis, is the provocative, perturbing enigma of the Other as an\nunknowable \u201cx,\u201d an unfathomable abyss of\nwithdrawn-yet-proximate alterity (in his 1895 Project for a\nScientific Psychology, to which Lacan refers repeatedly, Freud\ndepicts this alterity in the guise of the Nebenmensch als\nDing [Neighbor-as-Thing]).\n\nFor Lacan, the Freudian Oedipus complex stages the drama of the\nchild\u2019s laborious struggles to situate him/her-self\nvis-\u00e0-vis all three register-theoretic dimensions of\nOtherness. Thanks particularly to what he takes from his engagements\nwith structuralism, Lacan, throughout his career, is careful to avoid\na pseudo-Freudian reification of the bourgeois nuclear family, with a\nmother and father biologically sexed female and male respectively. The\nmaternal and paternal Oedipal personas are psychical-subjective\npositions, namely, socio-cultural (i.e., non-natural, non-biological)\nroles that potentially can be played by any number of possible persons\nof various sexes/genders.\n\nThat noted, in the Lacanian version of the Oedipus complex, the\nmaternal figure initially features for the infant as a Real Other\n(i.e., the Nebenmensch als Ding)\u2014more specifically, as\nan obscure omnipotent presence who is the source of all-important love\n(more will be said about Lacan\u2019s concept of love\u2014see\n 2.4.1\n below). But, because of the combination of her obscurity and\nimportance, the mother qua Real Other also is a source of\ndeeply unsettling anxiety for the very young child. She seemingly\nthreatens her offspring with being alternately too smothering or too\nwithdrawn, too much or not enough. In his/her anxiousness about\ncontrolling the ultimately uncontrollable presence (and absence) of\nthis mysterious and indispensable maternal Other, the child confronts\nthe question, \u201cWhat does the (m)Other want?\u201d The\ninfant\u2019s gradual formation of an ego as per the temporally\nelongated processes delineated in Lacan\u2019s account of the mirror\nstage (see\n 2.2\n above) is, in part, a response to this riddle (albeit in a broader\nsense, with the child constructing an ego-level identity informed by\nthe perceived wants of Others in addition to the mother, such as the\nfather).\n\nIn relation to the immediately preceding, Lacan\u2019s Oedipal father\nis an Other with both Symbolic and Real faces. On the Symbolic side,\nthe paternal figure represents the answer to the question, \u201cWhat\ndoes the maternal Other want?\u201d In Lacan\u2019s terminology, the\nchild\u2019s alighting upon the paternal third party in the family\nromance of the Oedipal social triangle as the solution to the puzzle\nof the maternal figure\u2019s enigmatic intentionality amounts to\n\u201cthe desire of the mother,\u201d as an unknown, being replaced\nby \u201cthe paternal metaphor.\u201d Directly connected to this,\nLacan (re)defines the phallus (which is not the penis) as the\nstructural function of whatever \u201cx\u201d the child\nhypothesizes the paternal figure possesses making him the focus of the\nmaternal figure\u2019s desire, that is, the possession enabling the\nfather to domesticate and control the mother\u2019s otherwise\nunpredictable desire. Also at the level of the Symbolic, the paternal\nfunction involves bringing to bear within the child\u2019s familial\nsphere the disciplinary and prohibitory features of the family\u2019s\nenveloping symbolic order as their socio-linguistic milieu (this\nentails such impositions as weaning, toilet training, exogamy, and\n\u201ccastration\u201d in the Freudian-Lacanian sense\u2014see\n 2.4.1\n below). As for Real Otherness here, this would be the version of the\npaternal figure mythically portrayed by Freud in Totem and\nTaboo (1913), namely, the tyrannical, enjoying-without-restraints\n\u201cprimal father\u201d (Urvater) of the savage fraternal\nhorde, the exception to the otherwise universal law of (symbolic)\ncastration. This Real Urvater arguably is a fantasy-construct\ngenerated in and by the Oedipus complex, with the child imagining an\nobscene, dark, jouissance-saturated underbelly behind the\nSymbolic fa\u00e7ade of paternal authority and its rules.\n\nThe child\u2019s identifications with maternal and paternal Others\nare distributed across Real and Symbolic dimensions. However,\ndifferent subjects-in-formation distribute their identifications\ndifferently. Freud, in his reconsiderations of earlier renditions of\nthe Oedipus complex, came to highlight an asymmetry between Oedipal\ndynamics for young boys and girls, repudiating the idea of girls\nundergoing an \u201cElectra complex\u201d as the symmetrical\ncounterpart to the Oedipus complex. Skipping over a lot of details and\ncutting a long story short, the later Lacan, when taking up the topic\nof sexual difference, preserves this Freudian emphasis on asymmetry.\nIn this vein, Lacan introduces the idea of sexuation as the Real of\nsexual difference, namely, as an impenetrable, opaque facticity of\nthis difference continually prompting and yet perpetually resisting\nbeing adequately translated into the terms of Imaginary and Symbolic\nrealities. As neither biologically given sex nor socially constructed\ngender, the Real of sexuation is what is responsible for the absence\nof an exhaustively representable, symbolizable natural and/or cultural\nrelationship between sexuated positions (as per Lacan\u2019s\nstatement, \u201cIl n\u2019y a pas de rapport\nsexuel\u201d). The structural-psychical positions of masculinity\nand femininity embody constitutively out-of-synch and inherently\nincommensurable subjective stances, incompatible (yet interacting)\narrangements of distinct sorts of libidinal economies.\n2.4 The Libidinal Economy\n\nFreud\u2019s metapsychology of the libidinal economy, of the\nunderlying motivational mechanisms of psychical life, is grounded on\nhis theory of drive (Trieb, and not Instinkt,\ndespite many English mistranslations of Trieb as\n\u201cinstinct\u201d). Lacan elaborates upon and extends this\nFreudian theoretical framework. In the process, he reworks some of\nFreud\u2019s concepts and adds other concepts of his own.\n2.4.1 Need-Demand-Desire and Castration\n\nNeed, demand, and desire form a conceptual-terminological triad in\nLacanian theory. Needs are biologically innate vital requirements for\nthe human being as a living organism. Humans are born saddled with\nsuch imperatives from the very start, although, as per Freudian\nHilflosigkeit, they are powerless on their own to satisfy\nthese bodily dictates for a protracted initial period lasting well\ninto childhood (see\n 2.2\n above).\n\nThe combination of being prematurationally helpless but having\nunavoidable needs means that, over the course of physical and mental\ndevelopment, the infant must come to articulate its needs to bigger\nothers. These others (as three-dimensional O/others along the lines of\nLacan\u2019s register theory\u2014see\n 2.3\n above) are addressed as those capable of assisting in the meeting and\nquelling of needs. Of course, crying, screaming, gesticulating, and\nthe like are early expressions of needs, being the fashions in which\ninfants prior to acquiring language per se alert the older individuals\naround them of their requirements. Even at this early stage, the\ninfant is forced to rely on his/her thus-addressed significant others\nto interpret the \u201cmeaning\u201d of his/her cries, screams, and\ngesticulations (\u201cAh, you\u2019re hungry,\u201d \u201cUh oh,\nthat means you\u2019re tired,\u201d \u201cSo, it\u2019s time to\nchange your diaper,\u201d etc.). Through these spontaneous\ninterpretations, others, whether knowingly or not, participate with\nthe pre-verbal child in shaping links between needs and the socially\nmediated significance of the expressions of needs. These others\nthereby lend the child\u2019s noises and movements the significance\nof being \u201cdemands,\u201d with this amounting to a kind of\nassistance provided over and above the assistance of meeting bare\nneeds themselves. Now, this is not to say that there are no natural\ncorrelations whatsoever between needs and their pre-verbal expressions\nhardwired into babies\u2019 behavioral repertoires. But, arguably,\ninfants are not immediately and automatically self-consciously aware\nof these correlations as such, with caretakers\u2019 responses being\nkey aids in helping the child become explicitly cognizant of\nneed-expression couplings.\n\nAs the infant continues maturing, soon acquiring language, the\ninfluences of others and Others (especially inter-subjective others as\nconveyors of the signs and signifiers of the big Other qua\ntrans-subjective symbolic order\u2014see\n 2.1.2\n and\n 2.3\n above) increasingly exert themselves on the forming of associative\nconnections between needs and demands. For example, as part of\nsocialization and education, parents typically begin to introduce the\ndiscipline of insisting that the child articulate his/her requirements\nand urges in specific manners (\u201cSay \u2018please\u2019 and\n\u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d \u201cAsk nicely,\u201d \u201cIn\nthis household, we do not yell when we\u2019re hungry,\u201d and so\non). The child learns that he/she must accept, internalize, and speak\n\u201cthe discourse of the Other\u201d (in this instance, the\nparents) in order to get his/her needs recognized, acknowledged, and\naddressed in a satisfactory fashion. In short, he/she must make\ndemands couched in terms and conventions imposed by O/others\u2019\nsocio-symbolic regimes. Lacan maintains that natural bodily needs\nhence, via the inter- and trans-subjective dynamics of demand, are\n\u201coverwritten\u201d by the signifiers of an ultimately Symbolic\nOtherness, an overwriting through which the bases of the libidinal\neconomy are denaturalized and subjected to socio-cultural forces and\nfactors. Much of this beds down in the young, nascent subject\u2019s\npsyche, thereafter exerting (often in unconscious ways) decisive\neffects on this person\u2019s libidinal economy throughout his/her\nlife.\n\nIn his 1958 \u00e9crit \u201cThe Signification of the\nPhallus,\u201d Lacan provides a succinct formula for defining\n\u201cdesire\u201d in relation to both need and demand. He\nstipulates that desire is what remains after need is subtracted from\ndemand. What, exactly, does this equation mean? Through being\ntranslated into demands, needs come to be saddled with surpluses of\nmore-than-biological significances; vital requirements take on the\nexcess baggage of meanings over and above the level of brute, simple\norganic survival. Largely by virtue of what O/others add to the\nchild\u2019s experiences of needs through superimposing\ninterpretations of these needs as socio-symbolic demands, the meeting\nof the child\u2019s needs in response to his/her demands makes these\nneeds into, first and foremost, litmus tests of where he/she stands in\nrelation to these thus-addressed significant O/others. Being given\nspecific items of food by a parent in response to a demand expressing\nhunger can indicate to the child not only that the parent understands\nthat a need to eat has to be met, but also, and more importantly, that\nhe/she is loved by the parent, that he/she enjoys a privileged\nposition in relation to the parent\u2019s attention and priorities.\nLacan therefore asserts that each and every demand is, at bottom, a\ndemand for love. Returning to the equation \u201cdemand \u2013 need\n= desire,\u201d what is desired when a demand is addressed to another\nis not so much the meeting of the thus-expressed need, but, in\naddition to this, the very love of another.\n\nParents of children are all too familiar with seemingly endless series\nof demands from the little ones (\u201cI want a sandwich,\u201d\n\u201cOK, here\u2019s a sandwich\u201d\u2026 \u201cI want a\nlollipop,\u201d \u201cOK, here\u2019s a lollipop\u201d\u2026\n\u201cI want a new toy,\u201d \u201cOK, here\u2019s a new\ntoy\u201d\u2026 and on and on until an exhausted parental\n\u201cNo\u201d is pronounced and wearily defended against vigorous\nprotests). Adults, whether parents or not, also are aware of a similar\ndesiring restlessness in themselves, an inability to acquire an object\nor attain a success that would be \u201cIT\u201d\n(with-a-capital-I-and-T), the final be-all-and-end-all telos\nof wanting and wishing satisfying them for good forever after.\nSimilarly, an adult in a romantic relationship never is content with\nbeing told that he/she is loved by the beloved only once; he/she\ninsists upon repetitions ad infinitum of the affirmation by\nthe significant other that, \u201cI love you\u201d (as if no\naffirmation is ever quite enough). With both children and adults,\nmargins of dissatisfaction, perpetually resurfacing itches that never\ncan be scratched just right, are to be explained, according to Lacan,\nthrough a clarification of the essence of the \u201clove\u201d\ndemanded in all demands in excessive addition to the gratification of\ncorresponding needs. What is being requested is an impossibility\nimpossible on the basis of the register-theoretic version of\nO/otherness \u00e0 la Lacanianism (see\n 2.1\n and\n 2.3\n above): the non-objectifiable negativity of the kinetic, slippery\nheart of Real Otherness (i.e., the always-on-the-move affection,\nfocus, etc. of the Real Other\u2019s desiring core both conscious and\nunconscious) being objectified as the positivity of a static, stable\nthing (i.e., a special object able to be gift-wrapped and handed over\nas part of the response to demand). Employing once again the example\nof hunger, while the O/other can respond to demands for food with the\nprovision of nourishing substances answering to the need for\nnourishment, he/she is constitutively incapable of turning the nucleus\nof his/her desiring being (i.e., the non-object of his/her\n\u201clove\u201d) into one tangible object among others to be\nbestowed along with food and the like. As will be discussed here\nshortly (see\n 2.4.3\n below), conscious and unconscious fantasies are aroused on the sides\nof desiring demanders\u2014and, everyone is a desiring\ndemander\u2014by the necessary, inevitable dissatisfactions\naccompanying desires. These fantasies cover over the impossibility of\nbringing desires to satisfying ends. They do so by constructing\nscenarios in which there is a yet-to-be-(re)obtained object that\nreally is \u201cIT.\u201d Moreover, in these fantasmatic scenarios,\nanswers to questions of Real Others\u2019 inscrutable desires\n(\u201cWhat does the Other want, and want specifically of me?\u201d)\nare staged.\n\nAs should be evident by now, the intervention of the signifiers of the\nsymbolic order (i.e., the discourses of big Others) is integral to the\ngenesis of the need-demand-desire triad. Through the intrusion of\nthese signifiers cutting into both the body and mind of the young\nchild, a proto-subjective being of need, passing through the demands\nof discipline (in both sense of the genitive), is transformed into a\nsubject of desire. Such a subject is\n\u201cbarred\u201d\u2014Lacan\u2019s matheme for the barred\nsubject of desire is $\u2014alienated from its natural needs and\nderailed onto the tracks of non-natural desires doomed never to reach\nenjoyable destinations. In connection with his revisions of the\nOedipus complex (see\n 2.3\n above), Lacan turns Freudian castration into \u201csymbolic\ncastration.\u201d The latter, rather than being a real or imagined\nscene in which a specific threat to bodily integrity is issued,\ndesignates the dual somatic and psychical discombobulating effects\nupon the premature human animal caused by insertion into and\nsubjection to surrounding socio-symbolic contexts, of being made to\ndepend on the foreignness of signifiers and everything they bring with\nthem.\n2.4.2 Drive and Jouissance\n\nIn Freud\u2019s drive theory, sublimation amounts to a drive finding\na means to secure satisfaction (Befriedigung) in the face of\n\u201caim-inhibition\u201d (i.e., a blockage of its prior path to an\nearlier aimed-at drive-object). But, as Lacan observes, Freud also\noddly defines the aim (Ziel) of any and every drive as\nsatisfaction. Therefore, how can a drive achieve satisfaction if its\naim (defined as the achievement of satisfaction) is inhibited?\nLacan\u2019s response to this apparent Freudian contradiction is to\nput forward a distinction between the aim and \u201cgoal\u201d of\nthe drive as a metapsychological entity: While the aim of a drive can\nbe and inevitably is inhibited, its (true) goal always is\nreached\u2014and this because its goal is nothing other than enjoying\nthe ceaseless movement of repetitively rotating around whatever\nblockages land on its path.\n\nAccording to a certain widely accepted reading appealing to the\nimmediately above (promoted by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek and the\nSlovenian School of Lacanian theory), Lacan distinguishes between\ndesire and drive. As seen (see\n 2.4.1\n above), an essential characteristic of desire is its restlessness,\nits ongoing agitated searching and futile striving. No object it gets\nits hands on is ever quite \u201cIT.\u201d Whereas desire is stuck\nwith its dissatisfied drifting from object to object and ever onward\n(in a structured movement akin to the \u201cspurious/bad\ninfinite\u201d as per Hegel), drive derives a perverse enjoyment from\nthis desire-fuelled libidinal circling around the vanishing point of\nthe impossible-qua-unattainable. There where desire is\nfrustrated, drive is gratified. Drive gains its satisfaction through\nvampirically feeding off of the dissatisfaction of desire.\n\nLike the register of the Real with which it is most closely\nassociated, jouissance, a notion that comes to the fore at\nthe end of the 1950s, is difficult to encapsulate in succinct defining\nformulas. By the end of Lacan\u2019s itinerary at the start of the\n1980s, this term had taken on a plethora of significations, dividing\nand sub-dividing into a wide array of distinct-but-related concepts.\nIn English-language Lacanian scholarship, jouissance almost\nalways is left untranslated, since its English equivalent,\n\u201cenjoyment,\u201d fails to capture the specifically sexual\nconnotations of the original French word.\n\nThe best way to begin getting a sense of what Lacan means by\njouissance is through reference to the Lacanian distinction\nbetween drive and desire (see\n 2.4.2\n above) in conjunction with select stipulations by Freud regarding the\ninfamous death drive (Todestrieb) of Freud\u2019s later dual\ndrive theory (first laid out in Beyond the Pleasure Principle\n(1920)). Like Freud\u2019s Todestrieb, Lacan\u2019s\njouissance is \u201cbeyond the pleasure principle\u201d\n(this being another reason why the English \u201cenjoyment,\u201d as\nsynonymous with pleasure, is an inappropriate translation). The\npost-1920 Freud muses that all drives might be said to be death\ndrives, meaning that each and every drive perhaps works, at least in\ncertain respects at certain times, contrary to the pursuit of the\npleasurable as balance, gratification, homeostasis, satisfaction, and\nso on. Along these same lines, the Lacanian drive extracts\n\u201cenjoyment\u201d from the thwartings and failures of desire;\nwhereas the latter is oriented by the tantalizingly elusive\ntelos of pleasure qua satisfaction, the former\ngenerates its jouissance-beyond-pleasure precisely through\nthe inhibiting of desire itself. The many possible sadistic and\nmasochistic implications of this side of the libidinal economy are not\ndifficult to imagine.\n\nOne of several clinical phenomena pushing Freud into dethroning the\npleasure principle in 1920 as the formerly hegemonic ruler of the\npsyche in its entirety is \u201crepetition compulsion\u201d\n(Wiederholungszwang)\u2014specifically, the psyche\u2019s\nperplexing, spontaneous compulsive repeating of that which is painful\nand/or traumatic (examples of this include post-traumatic disorders,\nso-called \u201cnegative therapeutic reaction,\u201d and the\nrecurrent types of self-defeats unconsciously arranged by neurotics\nfor themselves). One of the theoretical functions of the death drive\nis to account for whatever disregards or disrupts the reign of the\npleasure principle as a fundamental \u201claw\u201d of mental life.\nIn Lacan\u2019s conceptual apparatus, jouissance sometimes\nlikewise refers to an overriding force/tendency compelling repetitions\nof experiences or events upsetting the calm, delicate equilibrium of\npsychical subjectivity\u2019s Imaginary-Symbolic reality (hence the\nassociation of jouissance with the Real).\n\nIn the process of the neonate as a biological being acquiring both an\nego and a speaking subjectivity\u2014this involves the living\norganism being submitted to the mediating matrices of\nImaginary-Symbolic realities\u2014the human creature supposedly\nloses, through symbolic castration (see\n 2.4.1\n above), access to an immediate, undiluted jouissance in its\nraw, unmitigated intensities (whether this is an actual, factual\noccurrence in linear, chronological ontogeny or an\napr\u00e8s-coup, retrospective fantasy is a complicated\nissue in Lacanian theory). The jouissance presumably lost to\nthe speaking subject returns only in the guises of what might be\nlabeled \u201climit experiences,\u201d namely, encounters with that\nwhich is annihilating, inassimilable, overwhelming, traumatic, or\nunbearable. Similarly, jouissance, in this vein, is related\nto transgressive violations, the breaching of boundaries and breaking\nof barriers. It is difficult, if not impossible, for the\nparl\u00eatre to accommodate, tolerate, and digest. The\nspeaking being is forced to cohabitate uneasily with its always\nproblematic jouissance.\n2.4.3 Fantasy and Object a\n\nIn line with Freud\u2019s discussions of fantasizing in psychical\nlife, Lacan treats fantasies, particularly those functioning at the\nlevel of fundamental formations of the unconscious, as schematizations\n(in a quasi-Kantian respect) of desiring subjectivity. Put\ndifferently, the wants and wishes of a particular subject are shaped\nand governed by a peculiar skeletal template, an idiosyncratic and\nparadigmatic Ur-scene, in which this desiring subject is\npositioned in a specific manner vis-\u00e0-vis a specific\nobject of its desire. This fundamental template/scene is an\nunconscious formation operating as a transcendental condition of\npossibility for the subject\u2019s libidinal economy in all its\ncrucial, symptomatic manifestations. Lacan\u2019s matheme for the\nfantasy is $ \u25ca a. The $ stands for the subject of desire\nbrought into being by the barring/splitting consequences of\nOthers\u2019 mediating influences (see\n 2.3\n and\n 2.4.1\n above).\n\nThe a stands for objet petit a, that is, object\na as the \u201cobject-cause of desire.\u201d Lacan employs\nthis latter phrase for object a because this\n\u201cobject\u201d is a spectral, virtual construct of what would\nqualify as \u201cIT\u201d for the desiring subject (see\n 2.4.1\n above), with this libidinal-transcendental schema of desire\u2019s\nobject (i.e., a) \u201ccausing\u201d select given empirical\nobjects in a person\u2019s libidinal-amorous history and experience\nto be desired as stand-ins for \u201cIT.\u201d However, these\nsubstitutes are always and necessarily inadequate and unsatisfactory\ndue to an insurmountable, ineliminable gap between the\nmore-than-empirical fantasmatic objet a originating in the\nsubject\u2019s unconscious past and the empirical objects present and\nfuture incarnating it. These latter objects are situated in\nImaginary-Symbolic reality, condemned partially and imperfectly to\nembody an interminably receding and elusive surplus (i.e., the\nimpossible-qua-Real dimension of object a).\n\nTo refer back one last time to the matheme of fantasy ($ \u25ca\na), the diamond-shaped \u201clozenge\u201d\n(poin\u00e7on) \u25ca can be read as a condensation of four\nsymbols: one, \u2227 (the logical symbol for conjunction\n[\u201cand\u201d]); two, \u2228 (the logical symbol for disjunction\n[\u201cor\u201d]); three, > (the mathematical symbol for\n\u201cgreater than\u201d); and, four, < (the mathematical symbol\nfor \u201cless than\u201d). As per Lacan\u2019s matheme, the\nsubject\u2019s desires are scripted and orchestrated by an\nunconscious fundamental fantasy in which the desiring subject ($) is\npositioned in relation to its corresponding object-cause of desire\n(a). Hence, \u2227, \u2228, >, and < represent, in a\ndeliberately loose and open fashion, possible variants of this\npositioning of $ vis-\u00e0-vis a. Singular subjects flesh\nout conjunction, disjunction, being \u201cgreater than,\u201d and\nbeing \u201cless than\u201d in their own styles, namely, as their\nunique fantasies of merger or symbiosis (conjunction), scorn or\nrefusal (disjunction), mastery or domination (\u201cgreater\nthan\u201d), slavery or submission (\u201cless than\u201d), and any\nnumber of other possible particularizations of these four basic\ncategories of rapport.\n\nIn some of Lacan\u2019s earlier presentations of the mirror stage,\nthe a serves as an abbreviation for autre (other).\nMore precisely, in this context, a refers primarily to the\nlittle-o-other as the Imaginary ego (see\n 2.2\n and\n 2.3\n above). The ego is an \u201cother,\u201d a not-me misrecognized as\n\u201cme,\u201d insofar as it is brought into existence through a\ncombination of an object external to the (proto-)subject (i.e., the\nimago-Gestalt of the body image) and the interests of\nSymbolic and Real Others investing this object through words and\nbehaviors. Within the framework of the mirror stage, a\n(usually as a\u2019) also designates alter-egos as the\nImaginary partners with which the ego itself is inextricably\nintertwined, invariably defining itself through reference to these\npartners.\n\nFurthermore, there indeed is a thread of continuity between the\na of the mirror stage and object a: Both ego (as\na) and fantasy (with its a) unconsciously are the\nsubject\u2019s fateful answers to the questions, \u201cWhat does the\nOther want?\u201d and \u201cHow must I position myself with respect\nto the desire of the Other?\u201d (see\n 2.3\n above). Lacan\u2019s a, like the rest of his mathemes, is\ndeliberately handled as akin to an algebraic variable. It is a\nplaceholder for any number of particular types of determinants: what\nan Other desires, what I must be so as to be the object of an\nOther\u2019s desire, what would at last lay to rest my restless\nstrivings and yearnings, what would do so for a significant Other to\nwhom I remain attached, etc. But, in all cases, a reflects\nLacan\u2019s Hegelian-Koj\u00e8vian slogan having it that,\n\u201cman\u2019s desire is the desire of the Other.\u201d\n",

As regards primary sources, only\nfifteen of Lacan\u2019s twenty-six annual seminars have been\npublished by Jacques-Alain Miller through the Champ freudien series.\nAs of the end of 2012, the following seminars are available in\nofficial editions: I, II, III, IV, V, VII, VIII, X, XI, XVI, XVII,\nXVIII, XIX, XX, and XXIII. Of these, only seven have been published as\nauthorized English translations by W.W. Norton and Company: I, II,\nIII, VII, XI, XVII, and XX. The primary sources listed below are the\navailable book-length texts by Lacan. These lists do not include\nvarious separate essay-length pieces scattered across numerous\nplaces.</p>\n<p>\nAs regards secondary sources, I have been highly selective in\ncompiling the list that follows. There are mountains of literature on\nLacan in multiple languages.
