    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n1.1 Architecture as Relatively Neglected by Philosophy\nOver the course of Western philosophy, including the history of\naesthetics, architecture has largely failed to attract sustained,\ndetailed attention\u2014particularly as compared with other\nartforms. Neither philosophical issues prompted by architecture, nor\nthe fit of architectural phenomena into larger philosophical debates,\nhave captured the philosophical imagination as have, for example,\nliterature or painting. Some contributions across the span of Western\nphilosophy\u2014including those of Wolff and Schopenhauer\u2014rank\nas historically significant; other, more recent accounts are\nbroad-ranging and gravid with conceptual concerns, including those of\nScruton and Harries. Further, some philosophers have even dabbled in\narchitectural projects: Dewey contributed to plans for the Chicago\nLaboratory School, Wittgenstein collaborated on designing a house for\nhis sister, and Bentham sketched the Panopticon design as a plan for\nprison reform. Yet the overall state of philosophical reflection on\narchitecture\u2014even in the present day\u2014is less lively than\nlike discussions focused on artforms of far more recent origin, such\nas film or comics. Some philosophers working in the Continental\ntradition have offered accounts of the experience of architecture or\nits social ramifications; a deficiency is more marked in analytic\naesthetics.\nFor more on the background and context of conceptual explorations\nof architecture, see the supplementary documents:\n\nPhilosophy of Architecture in Historical Perspective\nPhilosophy and the Tradition of Architectural Theory\n\n1.2 A Word on Terminology\n This essay refers generally to the basic creative output of\narchitects, in any (unspecified) form, as \u201carchitectural\nobjects\u201d. This is in parallel with the term \u201cart\nobjects\u201d in use, across aesthetics and philosophy of art, to\nrefer to objects created by artists independent of the artform and\nwithout regard to ontological or other discussions where other terms\nmay evoke one or another particular stance. It may turn out that\n\u201carchitectural object\u201d proves value-laden. Yet this is\nless likely than with common alternatives in the literature:\n\u201carchitectural works\u201d, perhaps wedded to creator intent,\nstatus as extant or integral whole, or aesthetic ranking; or\n\u201cbuildings\u201d, certainly wedded to built, hence concrete,\nstructures.  \u201cBuilt structures\u201d is used here (except in\nhistorical reference) to refer to the generic built output resulting\nfrom architectural design, in recognition of a domain some view as\nbroader than buildings per se.\n2. What is Architecture?\nFundamental questions about the nature of architecture motivate\nmuch of contemporary philosophy of architecture: what sort of\nenterprise architecture is; whether architecture has essential\nfeatures; what kinds of things architecture makes\u2014yielding the\nfurther issue as to whether architecture always, only sometimes, or\nnever is an artform; what renders architecture distinct from other\nartforms (if it is one); and whether architecture includes all built\nstructures.\n2.1 The Sort of Enterprise Architecture Is\nOne approach to grasping the true nature of architecture is to\ndefine it in terms of the discipline. We may embrace the disciplinary\ndeterminism of the British architect Cedric Price: \u201cArchitecture\nis what architects do\u201d. Defining the discipline or practice of\narchitecture may seem a simple empirical affair. Even if we have\ndifficulty assessing what architectural objects or products are, we\ncan point to thousands of architects over several millennia around the\nworld engaged in one or another sets of activities that conventionally\nhave been associated with architectural practice, and generate a long\ndisjunctive claim about what architects do. An empirically rooted\napproach has a long history: Vitruvius devises his normative account\nof the virtuous architect on the basis of his familiarity with\nthen-contemporary practice. The same is true of other traditional\naccounts of virtue in architects or builders, as in the sixth to\neighth century Indian M\u0101nas\u0101ra\n(\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0938\u093e\u0930) (Acharya 1928) and\neleventh century Chinese Yingzao fashi\n(\u71df\u9020\u6cd5\u5f0f) (Feng 2012). In the present-day,\nsociology of the architectural profession offers a detailed empirical\nperspective (Gutman 1988), and this can be extended to a sociology of\narchitectural worlds, modeled on Becker\u2019s sociology of art\nworlds. \nA problem arises, though, if we look to history or sociology for a\nunified account with common features of an architectural\ndiscipline. While architectural practice has remained stable in\ncertain respects, change over its history greatly limits common\nfeatures, perhaps, to a core set of basic tools and rudimentary\nprinciples of structural engineering. This suggests that, at root, the\npractice of architecture must involve engineering or related\ndesign. But architecture can\u2019t be reduced to a form of\nengineering, if we think architectural ideals, taste, and expertise\ncontribute something over and above engineering facts, rules, and\npractical knowledge. These further contributions suggest an art or\nart-like role for architectural practice. However, the historical\nrecord is mixed on the matter of whether architects are at the same\ntime pursuing art (or what we now consider as art) or should be\nthought of as artists. Moreover, the historical record and resulting\ndisjunctive claim do not address cases where even the most basic tools\nor structural principles are not deployed. Some such cases of not\nobserving basic structural principles, as fantasy architecture, may be\ndeemed marginal; other such cases, as landscape architecture, are\nnot.\nAnother dimension of defining architecture as a practice is\nspecifying the sorts of structures that architects design. At a bare\nminimum, we can say that they feature some connection to human\nuse. But attempts to render this as non-trivial introduce further\npuzzles (see \u00a72.3).\n2.2 Architecture and Essential Features\nA contrasting definitional approach suggests that, as a matter of\nreasoned judgment, we can attribute to architectural practice\u2014or\nto the domain of architectural objects\u2014core or even essential\nfeatures. A dominant reading of the Vitruvian tradition has it that\narchitecture embodies and is best understood through the three aspects\nof beauty, structural integrity, and utility. An essentialist variant\nsuggests that architects must observe all three aspects or that any\nstructure aspiring to architectural status features all three. Other\nprominent views advance a single aspect, generally function or form,\nas primary. Thus, functionalist architectural doctrine places function\nor utility at the heart of the architectural enterprise, with other\naspects of architecture subordinate thereto.\nA hard-line functional essentialist holds that, if a built\nstructure has no function, then it is not architecture. As a modest\ndissent, Graham (1989) proposes that such a structure is an\narchitectural work\u2014but a failure at such. One brand of\nmore radical rejection suggests that some architectural\nobjects\u2014perhaps including follies, memorials, or\nmonuments\u2014need have no function at all. As a competing\nessentialism, formalist architectural doctrine suggests that an object\nis architectural just in case it features forms proper to the\ndomain. A common interpretation says that forms proper to architecture\ncan be chosen off a stylistic menu (or combination of menus), leaving\narchitects great latitude while upholding the possibility of\ncontrasting, non-architectural forms (this is difficult to square,\nhowever, with some experimental architecture).\nIn weighting architecture\u2019s aspects as essential, core, or\nsome lesser status, a related question is whether one or another\naspect is primary or necessary to any of the others. As Graham notes\n(1989), the traditional question in architectural theory of whether\nform trumps or precedes function may be cast in such terms.\nAgainst these traditional brands of essentialism, two further kinds\nof doubt may be cast. First, it may be that the Vitruvian triad, or\nsome single aspect thereof, does not represent the right list\u2014we\nshould include either further aspects or different aspects\naltogether. Alternatives might include dimensions such as context,\nrelations among architectural objects, systemic features,\nsustainability, and psychological or social features. Some theorists\npropose other candidates as essential architectural aspects, including\nspace (Zevi 1978) or the organizing concept of the parti\n(Malo 1999).\nSecond, it may be that essentialism represents a false start.  On\none non-essentialist view, the nature of an architectural object is as\nwe experience it, a matter upon which we may agree but which depends\nin part on subjective perception and reception of, and interaction\nwith, the work (Scruton 1979/2013). This leaves open the possibility\nthat architecture has essential aspects but we simply don\u2019t\nexperience them as such. A more determined nominalist has it that\ndiversity among architectural objects is sufficient to quash the\nprospect that they share any essential aspects.\n2.3 The Kinds of Things Architecture Makes\nYet another way to pose the question of what architecture is\nfocuses on the sorts of things architectural objects are. In\nparticular, and relative to architecture\u2019s possible status as\nartform, architecture as a domain may be defined variously in terms of\nits objects being art objects (or not), being distinctive sorts of art\nobjects, or belonging exhaustively to a special class of\nbuilt structures (rather than including all such structures). \nWhether architecture always, only sometimes, or never is an\nartform. At the negative extreme, architecture may be viewed\nlike any engineered artifact that only incidentally bears aesthetic\nvalue. Any view of even slightly more positive valence bows in the\ndirection of intent to generate aesthetic value. The classic Vitruvian\nview, for example, has it that engineered design and aesthetic design\nare conjoint intentional elements of architectural objects. At the\npositive extreme, that is, the suggestion that architecture is always\nand in all ways an art, we may lose any means of discriminating among\nbuilt structures as art or not. This is a troubling prospect to\nexclusivists who see architecture as a high art only (see below). \nIn the negative camp, S. Davies (1994) argues that mere production\nof occasional artworks does not suffice to constitute an\nartform\u2014crafts being a notable example\u2014and the aim of\narchitecture is frequently, or even typically, not the production of\nart but useful items that do not aim at artistic value. In the\npositive camp, Stecker (2010) responds that we can carve out a\nsubclass of architectural objects that are art even if not all are. He\nadds, by way of historical argument, that architecture was included\namong the artforms, by early agreement among aestheticians. We might\nhave grounds for dismissing architecture from the canonical list if\nthe nature of architecture has changed, and in this vein Stecker notes\na rising tide of building design that is functionally oriented without\nsignificant aesthetic investment. A further alternative is to say that\narchitectural objects are all art works, or at least intended as such,\nwithin bounds. To make sense of the term \u201cvernacular\narchitecture\u201d requires that we see architectural objects as\ntypically art objects, while we make allowance for a broad class of\narchitectural objects that are low-art rather than high-art. \nIf the negative view is correct, then we need at least a workable\nset of criteria by which to discriminate architectural objects as\nart. To this end, we may draw on our intuitions, norms, or socially\nexpressed views. Further considerations may include the pertinent\ncultural tradition in which an architectural object is created,\nwhether particular sorts of aesthetic qualities count more towards\nartwork status, or whether there is instrumental benefit in\nconsidering the object as art.\nWhat renders architecture distinct from other artforms (if\nit is one). If architecture counts among the artforms, we may\nthink that it has distinctive features as such.  For example, Scruton\n(1979/2013) suggests that architecture is a\nnon-representational artform since it need not\u2014and\ngenerally does not\u2014represent any content. Despite\narchitecture\u2019s non-representational status, Scruton agrees with\nLanger (1953) (and anticipates Goodman (1985)) that architectural\nobjects can express or refer; in his view, to thoughts associated with\nexpressed properties. Others focus on architecture\u2019s distinctive\ncommitments to creator or user engagement. Winters (2011) sees\narchitecture as a \u201ccritical\u201d artform, requiring the\ncreator\u2019s engagement in the environment where other artforms may\ntolerate a creator\u2019s detached stance. Another distinctive mark\nof architecture among the artforms is its nontraditional status as a\nnarrative medium: the design of circulatory pathways allows\narchitectural objects to communicate a sequence of events through the\nmovement of visitors or inhabitants.\nWhether architecture includes all built\nstructures. Among the issues noted here, that of the greatest\nconsequence is the question of what counts among architectural\nobjects. On an inclusivist or expansive conception,\narchitectural objects are those designed objects ranging over the\nwhole of the built environment; on an exclusivist conception,\nthe range describes only some coherent subset of the whole of the\nbuilt environment. Examples of exclusivist subsets include (a) only\nbuilt structures that people can occupy (typically: houses, temples,\noffice buildings, factories, etc.), or (b) only built structures\ndesigned in primarily aesthetic (rather than purely functional)\nterms. An inclusivist conception entails a vastly larger architectural\ndomain of objects\u2014and areas of practice and inquiry.\nProponents of exclusivity (S. Davies 1994, Scruton 1979/2013) are\neager to protect architecture as the preserve of just those objects in\nthe built environment with abundant, apparent, and appreciable\naesthetic qualities; clear creator\u2019s intentions to generate art;\nor the panache of high art and engagement with art historical\ntrajectories. Stecker (2010) offers a putative variation, allowing\nthat as a broader creative medium architecture has an inclusivist\ncharacter\u2014though, as an artform, architecture is\nexclusivist. Scruton, for his part, identifies a specific intent to\nexalt: architecture as a pursuit has lofty goals or purposes,\nsuch that architectural objects do as well. One commonsense\njustification for exclusivity overlaps with an institutionalist\nperspective: laymen and connoisseurs alike can differentiate between\nthe striking work of an architect and the humdrum, cookie-cutter\nbuilding design of a draftsman.\nArguments for inclusivity include Carlson\u2019s appeal (1999) to\nconsider the class of architectural objects as of a continuum with the\nbroader class of everyday designed objects, where everything admits of\npossible aesthetic appreciation. Then, contra Stecker, we can\neffortlessly count all built structures as architecture, though some\nsuch things\u2014like garage doors or drainage ditches\u2014will\nneither look like, nor be, art. Another line of attack is to respond\nto exclusivists that architects simply have intentions to create\nobjects that are, in one aspect, art\u2014and that they may fail as\nart is beside the point. Further, it may be that recognizing\nintentions is irrelevant to judging a built structure as architecture,\nas when we judge as architecture the vernacular structures of foreign\ncultures. In response to Scruton\u2019s exaltation criterion, the\ninclusivist may note that for all artforms, there are typically\ninnumerable objects in the domain with no such goals\u2014and\npossibly no goals at all. Finally, inclusivism has its own commonsense\njustification: we standardly refer to a creator of a mundane built\nstructure as the architect, which seems less a linguistic shortcut\nthan recognition of the training and ethos attached to the creator of\narchitectural objects.\nIt is not clear how to craft intermediary positions between\ninclusivism and exclusivism, given that the various brands of\nexclusivism are not absolute and test cases are instead subject to\njudgment along any number of parameters. Stecker\u2019s exclusivism\nfor only architecture as art represents one such relativized\nstance. Inclusivism, by contrast\u2014along with any attached views\non, for example, architectural appreciation or the nature of aesthetic\nsuccess in architecture\u2014is an absolutist doctrine. All elements\nof the built environment\u2014and much else besides\u2014must count\nas architectural objects, or else the view fails. \n3. Metaphysics\nThe metaphysics of architecture covers a surprising range of\nquestions for those who see in architecture no more than\nmetaphysically mundane built structures or stones, wood, metal, and\nconcrete arranged in a pleasing fashion: the nature of architectural\nobjects and their properties and types, the relations of architectural\nparts and wholes, and the prospect of architectural causality.\n3.1 Ontology\nGiven the familiarity of architecture in, and as constitutive of,\nour physical surroundings, it is strongly intuitive to think of\narchitectural objects simply as buildings, in the way we think of the\nobjects of the sculpture artform as sculptures, or the objects of\ncutlery as forks, knives, and spoons. Yet such intuitions may be\nmisguided. For one, though some built structures\u2014including\nroadways, bazaars, and newspaper kiosks\u2014are not buildings\nper se, we may take them to have architectural properties and\nthereby consider them as architectural objects. For another, the\noutputs of architecture are not limited to built structures but\ninclude as well models, sketches, and plans, and this variety prompts\nquestions as to whether these are all reasonably considered\narchitectural objects and which, if any, such form of output\nrepresents a primary sort of object in architecture. A third\nconsideration is the focus in architecture, not solely on whole or\nindividual buildings, but also on parts of buildings and buildings\nconsidered in context, among other buildings and in landscapes\n(downwards and upwards compositionality or modularity). A fourth\nconsideration is that\u2014as with music and photography\u2014where\nmultiple instantiations of a given work are possible, we may dispute\nwhether the work is identical to the instancing built objects or else\nto the common entity (e.g., plan) on which those instances are\nmodeled. In addition to such challenges, the intuitive view must best\nalternative views.\nInstantiating architectural objects. To address\none sort of question about the identity of an architectural object, we\nseek kind-wise criteria that establish when an object is\narchitectural, instead of being non-architectural altogether\nor only derivatively so. To address another sort of identity question,\nwe look for instance-wise criteria that establish when an\nobject is this or that singular object, or an instance of a multiple\nobject. Ready criteria for identifying object instances in\narchitecture include historical, environmental, stylistic, and formal\nfeatures\u2014all of which may be read as signaling intentions to\ndesign particular, self-contained architectural objects. One issue,\nhowever, is whether traditional criteria (or others as may be posed)\nare sufficiently specific so as to skirt vagueness problems that all\nsuch artifacts may face (Thomasson 2005) and provide markers of being\na bona fide instance of a multiple work or a replica of all\nother bona fide instances (Goodman 1968/1976). \nArchitectural objects as ontologically\ndistinctive. Yet another way to pick out architectural\nobjects is to set them apart from other art objects or artifacts.\nAssuming there is more than one art ontology (see\nLivingston 2013), we might look to define a distinctive architectural\nontology by reference to specifically architectural qualities, such as\n\u201cmass\u201d (degrees of heaviness and lightness) or\ndirectedness (in circulatory pathways); or utility considerations,\nsuch as functional design, use, and change; or everyday artifactual\nfeatures. An inclusivist may add features special to the built\nenvironment beyond the realm of buildings.\nKinds of architectural ontologies.\nArchitecture\u2019s distinctive qualities may help sort among\ncandidate ontologies. One option is concretism, which\u2014in keeping\nwith standard causal efficacy claims and expressed intentions of\narchitects, clients, and users\u2014suggests that architectural\nobjects are either built structures or, on one variant, otherwise\nphysically instantiated designs for such structures (such as\nmodels). Concretism is supported by an artifactual ontology that\nsubsumes architectural objects into the class of objects that are the\nproduct of intentions, designs, and choices (on the view that\nall art objects are best so understood, see Dutton 1979,\nS. Davies 1991, Thomasson 1999, and Levinson 2007.) One version of\narchitectural artifactualism identifies buildings as systems (Handler\n1970). As against concretism, intentionality may be the mark of\nmaterially constituted, designed architectural objects but that need\nnot commit us to their existence alone or their primacy among such\nobjects. Moreover, taking intentions as determinative leaves the\nconcretist with the problem of shifting intentions and unintended\ngoals attached to built structures over time.\nAbstractist alternatives follow a well-worn path in aesthetics\n(Kivy 1983; Dodd 2007; critics include S. Davies 1991; Trivedi 2002;\nKania 2008; D. Davies 2009) and accommodate an expansive architectural\ndomain that includes historical, fantasy, and unbuilt works. Per\nclassic Platonism, abstractism allows identification of an\narchitectural object and concrete counterparts\u2014including\nmultiple replicas\u2014by reference to a single, fixed, and\nunchanging background source of what real world structures (or fantasy\nstructures) are and should look like.\nAgainst abstractism, some architectural objects are apparently\nsingular because historically and geographically contingent (Ingarden\n1962); it is unclear what an experiential account of\narchitectural abstracta looks like; and abstracta are not created\nwhereas architectural objects are. De Clercq (2012) further proposes\nthat, even if there were abstract architectural objects, we\ndon\u2019t refer to them. If I refer to \u201c10 Downing\nStreet\u201d, my expression picks out the built structure, not the\nplan, nor any other abstract representation or entity to which the\nbuilt structure at 10 Downing Street corresponds. However, a plausible\nalternate interpretation of the referent is as \u201cthe abstract\nobject physically instantiated by the structure I am perceiving (or\nhave perceived)\u201d.\nAs an alternative to an abstractist-concretist divide, a pluralist\nontology (per Danto 1993), allows \u201cmaterial\nbases\u201d and \u201caesthetic ideas\u201d as different sorts of\narchitectural objects. Goodman\u2019s account (1968/1976) lends\nitself to a pluralist, or at least aspectual, reading. He suggests\nthat, but for certain conditions unmet, an architectural object could\nbe identified as those structures that perfectly realize a\ncorresponding plan or other suitable architectural notation (see \u00a74). On his nominalist view, the\nobjects turn out to be the built structures but an available realist\ninterpretation\u2014which may better accommodate the multiples that\nare key to his story\u2014takes the objects to be the class of such\nstructures. \nAnother alternative suggests that architecture consists in actions\nor performances (per Currie 1989; D. Davies 2004), rendering\nderivative any concrete structures or \u201ctraditional\u201d\nabstract entities. Lopes (2007) proposes the possibility of an events\nor temporal parts ontology for a kind of built structure that passes\nin and out of existence, though De Clercq (2008, 2012) counters that\nsuch can be rendered in a material objects ontology through temporal\nindexing. Yet other ontologies are contextual or social\nconstructivist, proposing that architectural objects exist, beyond\ntheir status as structured materials, in virtue of ways our reality is\nframed, psychologically, socially, or culturally (per\nHartmann 1953, Margolis 1958). A shift in any such frame may bring\nabout shifting identity in an architectural object, in the manner of\nBorgesian art indiscernibles (Danto 1964), and it may count in favor of\nthose ontologies that architectural indiscernibles are all around, in\nthe form of repurposed built structures.\nPicking an ontology has wide-ranging significance, relative to\nquestions of material constitution, composition, part-whole relations,\nproperties, and relations in architecture, as well as the character of\narchitectural notation, language, cognition, or behavior; there are\nalso ramifications for simplicity and complexity, and the nature of\nornament, proportion, context, and style. In architectural practice,\nthe ontology of choice also colors perspectives on such matters as\nintellectual property rights, collaborative work, and preservation of\narchitectural structures. \n3.2 Part-Whole Relations\nOn one customary view of architectural objects, individual built\nstructures (or their abstract counterparts) represent the primary unit\nof our aesthetic or, for that matter, any architectural, concern; all\nother ways of carving up the architectural world are derivative.  This\nview is consonant with an equally customary perspective identifying\narchitectural objects with architectural works.  Alternative views\ninclude a \u201cmereology\u201d, in which parts of built structures\n(or their abstract counterparts) constitute independent architectural\nobjects; and an environmental contextualism, in which collections of\nbuilt structures (or their abstract counterparts) constitute\nindependent objects. Both alternatives share a commitment to some form\nof compositionality among architectural objects, that putting bits\ntogether yields aesthetically meaningful and utility-bearing\ncomposites, and taking them apart yields like results. In this, the\nmereological view represents a downward-compositionalism,\nsuggesting that architectural aesthetics demands our focus on\nstructural or other elements that can be meaningfully\ndistinguished. Environmental contextualism represents an\nupward-compositionalism, suggesting that architectural\naesthetics cannot be pursued entirely separately from the aesthetics\nof cities or towns (per Scruton 1979/2013).\n3.3 Causality\nQuestions about causality may seem out of place in discussions of\nimmobile objects, such as most architecture represents. Yet\narchitectural objects appear to have a role in causing events to\nhappen or other things to come into being. For example,\nsocio-psychological evidence suggests that architectural objects cause\nbehavior, and much of architectural design is predicated on this\nclaim. A further question is whether one architectural object may\n\u201ccause\u201d another. Thus, the presence of one or more\narchitectural objects might have a causal effect on the genesis or\ncharacter of one or more further works by dint of social utility,\nplanning needs, or aesthetic drivers. If true, then\u2014as with\nconsequentialism in ethics\u2014further questions arise regarding the\nrange of causal possibilities. Where ethicists ask whether a bad may\ngenerate a good, we may ask whether the presence or construction of a\nfunctionally or aesthetically impoverished architectural object might\noccasion the presence or construction of a more useful or pleasing\narchitectural object.\n4. Architectural Language and Notation\nThe notion that there is or should be an architectural\nlanguage\u2014or more than one\u2014has a provenance dating to\nancient times. In classic form, the architecture-as-language thesis\nruns from the Vitruvian suggestion that the orders present rules for\ncombination and ordering of architectural parts, through\nAlberti\u2019s rhetoric-inspired model for architectural description\n(van Eck 2000), and an analogy common among Renaissance and early\nmodern authors (such as Wren) of architectural rules and expressive\ncapacity with the Latin language. Lavin (1992) suggests that\nQuatrem\u00e8re de Quincy (1803) develops the thesis, from a\ntraditional view of the classical orders as grammatical building\nblocks directly representing primitive structures, to a modern view of\nstructural elements broadly representing social and moral ideas and\nprinciples. Variations of the thesis range over elements of an\narchitectural language, how it may be used, and from whence it may be\nderived.\nThe core idea, in its most prominent form, is that architecture as\na corpus of design ideas (realized or otherwise) features a set of\nfundamental design and style elements which can be combined and\nrelated according to a set of rules (syntax), capable of constituting\nor parlaying meaning (semantics), and subject to contextual\nsensitivity and internal or relational constraints on deployment and\nrealization (pragmatics). Beyond these structural parallels with basic\nfacets of natural language, it is held that the purposes and\npossibilities of architecture qua language yield further\nparallels, best explained by the notion that architecture has, or even\nis, a language.\nProponents of such views tend to subscribe, however, to defenses\nrooted in one or another feature of language. On\nsyntactically-inspired views\u2014the perspectives most indebted to\nthe Vitruvian account\u2014there is at least one architectural\ngrammar or set of rules for guiding proper assemblage of parts and\norientation, relation, and combination of whole architectural\nobjects. Some late twentieth century architectural theory embraced a\ngrammar framework (Alexander et al. 1977; Hillier and Hanson 1984);\nsuch a view also underwrites a formalist vision for CAAD (Mitchell\n1990).  Adherents of the\nview (Summerson 1966) assign themselves the central task of\nidentifying such rules. Even if this is achieved, though, a greater\npuzzle is whether there are identifiably preferable\nsyntaxes\u2014and what the criteria should look like. \nOn a semantics-inspired view, architectural objects or their\ncomponent parts bear meanings. A primary motivation for this view is\nthat, like objects of other artforms, architectural objects are\nexpressive, which suggests that what they express is meaning (Donougho\n1987). Proponents point to an array of architectural meanings,\ninternal or external to the object. The former tells us something\nabout the architectural object (its function or internal composition)\nor how it relates to other architectural objects (stylistic\nconventions); the latter tells us something about the world, as for\nexample, national or cultural associations (per\ngeographically variant design vocabularies), theological or spiritual\nsignificance (per religious design vocabularies), or\nper Hegel (1826), the Absolute Spirit. A more ambitious\nproposal (Baird 1969) has it that architectural objects exhibit such\nsemantic phenomena as metaphor, metonymy, or ambiguity.\nGoodman (1985) proposes that buildings have meaning in that they\nfunction symbolically relative to properties, feelings, or ideas,\nsometimes through \u201cstandard\u201d denotation, as when\nrepresenting symbolically (whether as building part or whole) some\nother object in the world. Primarily, though, buildings function\nsymbolically through exemplification (literal or explicit denotation)\nor expression (metaphorical exemplification) of properties of ideas,\nsentiments, or objects in the world. Buildings only constitute\narchitecture per se, in Goodman\u2019s view, if they bear\nmeaning in one or more of these ways. While Goodman may have\nidentified a denotative role for buildings, this is not clearly a\nsemantic role. \nA third approach, rooted in semiotics, emphasizes the role of\narchitectural objects as signs that prompt spectator behavior (Koenig\n1964, 1970) or indicate aspects of themselves, such as function (Eco\n1968). In either case, architectural objects are taken to operate\nas communicative systems (Donougho 1987). A semiotics program was\nembraced by the late 20th century postmodernist movement in\narchitecture (Venturi, Scott Brown, and Izenour, 1972/1977; Jencks\n1977).\nThe architectural language thesis, in its various forms, is widely\ndiscredited in recent philosophy of architecture. To begin with,\narchitecture features some qualities and exhibits some phenomena\nresembling those of natural language, but the parallels are neither\ncomprehensive nor fully compelling. On the syntactic side,\narchitecture may feature some brand of compositionality but different\nparts of architectural objects do not appear to function as do phrases\nor clauses (Donougho 1987). Syntactic \u201cwholes\u201d do no\nbetter, as there are no architectural assertions (Scruton\n1979/2013). As regards semantics, no likely candidate for an\narchitectural vocabulary regularly yields any specific class or\ninstance of meaning. Whereas for Vitruvius the Ionic order connotes\nfemale sensibility, it has a scholarly or deliberative meaning for\nRenaissance architects, \u201cgravitas\u201d for Blondel\n(1675\u20131683), and good governance for the architects of New\nYork\u2019s City Hall. Nor are there truth conditions such as might\nsupply the meaning of a well-defined architectural sequence (Taurens\n2008). It\u2019s not even clear that architectural communication is\nbest understood as sequential; Langer (1967), for example,\nsuggests that the symbolic communication of architectural objects is\ninstead holistic. As for pragmatics, there is no clear parallel with\nimplicature or related phenomena, hence architecture is incapable of\nthe accuracy or concision of expression we associate with language\n(Clarke and Crossley 2000). Finally, relative to semiotics, not\nall\u2014or even many\u2014buildings signify and we would only\nwant some to do so. \nOn the bright side, it\u2019s not clear that we should want\narchitecture to be more language-like. Regarding semantics, whatever\nwe gain in fixing particular meanings to architectural objects, we\nstand to lose in fungibility of their forms.  Regarding syntax,\nadherence to grammars brings the utility of standards and,\nper Scruton and Harries, a template for the community\u2019s\nvoice\u2014but for some may represent stifling constraints on the\naesthetic imagination.\nIn the end, it is useful to ask what work we expect the\narchitecture-as-language thesis to do. One view (Alexander et\nal. 1977; Alexander 1979) takes the thesis to underscore the robust\nnature of design patterns and known design solutions and, for a given\nculture, a common vocabulary (Donougho 1987). However, it may be\nsufficient to highlight ways in which architecture is like a\nlanguage, though they do not add up to an architectural language\n(Forty 2000). If so, then the thesis works best as a powerful metaphor\nrather than as literal truth. \nAn alternate take on linguistic phenomena in architecture appears\nin Goodman\u2019s proposal (1968) that we think of notational systems\nor schemes for the arts as symbolic systems with potentially\nlanguage-like features. Goodman suggests that architecture is a\nborderline case of an allographic artform, as its notational\nschemes\u2014in the form of plans\u2014are intended to guarantee\nthat all objects as are compliant are genuine instances of the\nwork. (Said intention, Goodman proposes, is not fulfilled.) That an\nobject instance the work just when compliant with the notation would\nindicate the notation\u2019s satisfaction of syntactic and semantic\ncriteria providing requisite grounds for identity across instances,\nand signal a corresponding insignificance of historical context and\nconditions of production to the object\u2019s identity. Goodman, for\nhis part, balks at taking architecture to be truly allographic given\nthe core role of history and context in generating particular\nstructures, and notational ambiguity that marks the analog medium of\ntraditional plans. Digital design may well resolve the ambiguity\nproblem, however, and allow indexing for history and context,\nrendering architecture allographic per Goodmanian criteria\n(S. Fisher 2000b). The term\n\u201carchitectural language\u201d then takes on a\ndifferent\u2014and more plausible\u2014sense.\n5. Formalism and Anti-formalism\n5.1 Formalism\nIn its most general sense, formalism works in architecture as it\ndoes (or doesn\u2019t) in other artforms. Thus, architectural\nformalism suggests that the sum total of aesthetic properties of an\narchitectural object are or arise from formal properties, such that\nour aesthetic judgments are warranted based on experience and\nassessment of just those properties. As architectural objects are\ntypically non-representational and designed with manipulation and\nrelation of forms as a primary task, it is natural that their formal\nproperties be seen as playing a central role in our aesthetic\nappreciation of them. The question posed to the traditional\n(\u201chard\u201d) formalist is whether those properties are\nunique or at least dominant drivers of aesthetic properties\nand judgment, a question underlined by important roles of history,\nstyles, and other contexts in our grasp of the architectural\nenterprise and individual architectural objects. Our aesthetic\njudgment of I. M. Pei\u2019s Louvre Pyramids is surely to some degree\nin reaction to their \u201cpure\u201d form but\u2014for the aware\nspectator\u2014perhaps just as much in reaction to their relationship\nto historical context (the Giza pyramids as emblematic of pyramidal\nform in architecture, and of monumental architecture altogether) or\nsetting (in contrast to the ornate neo-Baroque Louvre buildings that\nsurround them, but in keeping with traditional French emphasis on\ngeometric form in design).\nVariants of architectural formalism take formal properties as the\nproperties of (or arising from) the material or physical properties of\nbuilt structures (as consonant with concretism), or as the properties\nof (or arising from) the total properties specified by a set of formal\nparameters we identify with the architectural object (as consonant\nwith abstractism). Further architectural strains are characterized by\nmoderation (per Zangwill 2001), suggesting that some\narchitectural objects are best understood by appealing to their formal\nproperties, others not; or by assimilation of canonically non-formal\nproperties to a formalist scheme (in the manner of Levinson\u2019s\n\u201cindicated structures\u201d; see S. Fisher 2000b); or by a\n\u201cmereological\u201d view wherein some parts of a given\narchitectural object may be best understood and judged by their formal\nproperties, others not. For the merelogico-formalist, it might count\nin favor of considering such parts as independent architectural\nobjects that we can judge those parts on a formal basis alone.\nFormalism appears in some traditional architectural theories as a\nnormative practical or critical guideline, namely, that our best\ndesign thinking takes as central an architectural object\u2019s\nshape, color, and other formal elements. Other, non-formal aspects of\nan architectural object are discounted as contributing to its\nsuccess. Mitrovic (2011, 2013) embraces a normative formalist approach\nto criticism, on the grounds that the deeply visual nature of much\ncognition militates against basing appreciation or evaluation of\narchitectural objects exclusively or primarily on features we\nunderstand through non-visual means (such as context or history\nprovide). \n5.2 Anti-Formalism and Functional Beauty\nThe anti-formalist traditionally focuses on the importance to\naesthetic judgment about non-formal properties, including historical\ncontext; other, categorial forms of context (Walton 1970); or\nnon-cognitive properties. As an architectural application would have\nit, we likely judge Jefferson\u2019s University of Virginia campus as\nstately or dignified or evocative of democratic ideals because of the\nneo-classical design, the campus\u2019 place in histories of American\narchitecture and university architecture, and its continuous\nrededication through the everyday functioning of an enduring, living\nuniversity. None of this judgment appears to have particular roots in\nforms Jefferson deployed, except as befit a neo-classical\nstyle\u2014which style may be best grasped in historicist terms.\nAside from historicism, a principal variant of architectural\nanti-formalism derives from functional beauty theory, which has its\nroots in (a) a late modern tradition of judging an object beautiful if\nfit for its intended function (Parsons and Carlson (2008) find this\ntradition in Berkeley's Alciphron (1732) and Hume's related\nsuggestion (Treatise (1739-40)) that beauty of artifacts consists in\ntheir appearing to bear utility), and (b) Kant\u2019s proposal that\narchitecture is an artform capable of generating dependent beauty. (In\nthe latter case, beauty stands in relation to concepts with which we\nassociate architectural objects, which for such objects are typically\nthe ends towards which they are created.) One modern version proposes\ngauging the beauty of a designed object by reference to\ndesigner\u2019s intent in crafting a functional solution; for\nS. Davies (2006), where an object displays functional beauty,\naesthetic considerations and the object\u2019s primary function each\nact to shape the other. Per Parsons and Carlson (2008), the\nproblem with such intentionalist accounts in architecture (or\nelsewhere where functional beauty pertains) is that functions\nchange. To work around this difficulty, they suggest, we need\na theory focused on \u201cproper functions\u201d for the artifacts\nin question. This view is modeled on a selected effects account of\nbiological functions, as translated into a marketplace-driven scheme,\nwhere evolution of design solutions is driven by demand over time.\nFunctional beauty faces several challenges. Even in their advocacy,\nParsons and Carlson caution against the suggestion that function\nsolely determines form, as that would neglect other features\nof artifacts not possibly highlighted by their functions. Such\nfeatures include cultural significance or aspects of\nnon-dependent beauty as may be found in, for example, architectural\nornament. (In Davies\u2019 picture, there is no such neglect because\nthe functioning of artifacts\u2014including art and architectural\nobjects\u2014may have a cultural, spiritual, or otherwise\nnon-mechanical cast.) In the architectural realm, another challenge is\nposed by ruins, which may be beautiful but have no functions.  To the\ncharge that these represent counterexamples to functional beauty\ntheory, one tack is to answer that if ruins represent architectural\nobjects, they are dysfunctional and their beauty is manifest in\nnon-functional ways (Parsons and Carlson). Functional beauty theory is\nsaved on the whole but not as universally characteristic of\narchitectural objects.\nA further challenge casts doubt on seeing functional beauty as the\nonly variant of dependent beauty, or beauty as the sole aesthetic\nvalence of interest to a viable notion of dependent aesthetic\nproperties. In an architectural vein, those variants may include\nspiritual, emotional, or conceptual frameworks we bring to our grasp\nof such built structures as houses of worship, memorials, or triumphal\narches. We can tell functional stories about these sorts of structures\nin sociological or psychological analyses but not (or not only), as\nfunctional beauty accounts would have it, in terms of their mechanical\nor system-wise functioning.  \nLooking beyond functional beauty\u2014or more broadly, dependent\nbeauty\u2014accounts of architecture, an inclusivist will seek the\nthread that ties together architectural objects with aesthetic\nproperties of all description, be they functional, otherwise\ndependent, or freely (independently) endowed with beauty or other such\nproperties. Thus, a modernist gas station and a Tschumi folie\nmay share an elegance unrelated to functional ascription or\nthe lack thereof. A general theory of architectural objects, along\ninclusivist lines, suggests at least a moderate formalism.\n6. Architectural Experience, Knowledge, and Appreciation\n6.1 Experience of Architecture\nA staple of philosophy of art is that our experience of art\nobjects\u2014direct or otherwise\u2014is central to basic belief\nformation about them (first and foremost, aesthetic belief and\nappreciation of art objects). The philosophy of architecture is\ngenerally in agreement, though architectural objects may be of special\ncharacter in this regard, as our experiences of them gives rise to or\ninfluences an extended range of psychological states.  Beyond pleasure\nin architectural beauty or other \u201cpositive\u201d aesthetic\nproperties, experience of built structures also contributes to neutral\nand less positive states of mind, and shapes how we broadly take in\nour environment. A piece of that environmental understanding is local\nto the built structure itself: the ways we experience architectural\nobjects may contribute to how we comprehend, and interact with, those\nobjects.\nIn addition to facilitating understanding, appreciation, or use of\narchitectural objects, experience might also play\u2014or\nreflect\u2014a constitutive role. On Scruton\u2019s view, experience\nconstitutes for us the architectural object as an aesthetic\nobject (1979/2013). For Ingarden (1962), architectural experience\nentails not only our cognitive grasp of the built structure\u2019s\nphysicality but as well our grasp of its designation as a specifically\narchitectural object rather than, say, as an arrangement of\nbricks that happens to have the structure of a house.\nThe content and corresponding faculties of architectural experience\nlikely include some mix of the cognitive, emotive, and sensual.\nWhereas an abstractist may claim that experience of architectural\nobjects is solely a matter of intellectual grasp, even an\nanti-abstractist formalist needs the sensory as well to account for\nexperience of concrete shapes. Abstractist intellectualism\nnotwithstanding, accounts of architectural experience typically focus\non multiple content modalities. Sauchelli (2012a) proposes the use of\ncognition in grasping pleasure (\u201cintellectual pleasure\u201d)\nas a central feature of architectural experience. The idea is that\nfully comprehending the pleasure of the experience and thereby\nestablishing its aesthetic value requires cognition, in the form of\nattention to details and understanding of the architectural\nobject. \nA blend of the cognitive and sensual is also characteristic of\nScruton\u2019s proposed \u201cimaginative\nperception\u201d\u2014the notion that we may perceive the\ndetails of built structures in various ways, depending on directions\nthat our imagination takes us. Scruton (1979/2013) takes this\ncognitive act\u2014reminiscent of seeing-as and free play of the\nimagination\u2014as crucial to architectural experience. We are at\nall turns required to make interpretative choices in parsing ambiguous\nor multiform aspects of the built environment. Scruton focuses on\nvoluntary deployment of the imagination in perception at a\nmacro-level, concerning such matters as whether we see a sequence of\ncolumns as grouped one way or another, or see pilasters as ornamental\nor structural. The voluntary aspect of this account is critical to\nScruton\u2019s emphasis on the importance of taste and discrimination\nto architectural aesthetics. In this, he loosely tracks Geoffrey\nScott\u2019s view of architectural experience as \u201csensuous\nperception\u201d interpreted through attendant values\n(1914/1924).\nA generalized version of this account looks to perceptual tasks at\na more granular level. Our experiences of space and spatial\npositioning, depth, edge detection, color, and light yield multiple\ninterpretative possibilities across architectural objects, including\nthe simplest forms and smallest or largest parts of objects.  These\nperceptual tasks are pervasive and constant; sometimes involuntary and\nin the background, and other times as shaped by our willful\nimagining. If the involuntary tasks also represent or shape\ninterpretative acts, architectural experience by Scruton\u2019s\nmeasure is that much less subject to aesthetic taste or\ndiscrimination.\nThe dimensions of architectural experience are even larger when\ntaking into account the full breadth of the sensual. Following a long\ntradition of viewing architecture through art historical lenses,\nScruton focuses on architectural experience as primarily visual and\nstatic. In addition, though, other sensory modalities are factors:\nchanges in aesthetic judgments follow changes in those other sensory\nexperiences (Sauchelli 2012a). Such modalities among the non-visual\ninclude the tactile, aural, and olfactory.  Moreover, much\narchitectural experience is proprioceptive, incorporating visual\ninformation into a broader set of stimuli to grasp bodily position and\nmovement in relation to the built environment.\nSensation of movement might seem irrelevant to experiencing an\nimmobile object, save for the fact that, in architecture (as in\nsculpture) not all facets of a given whole work, or many other\narchitectural objects, can be perceived at the same time. The\nspectator or user must move around or within the object to perceive\nany significant percentage of it, much less the whole. Experience of\nmovement around architectural objects highlights for us the design\nfeature of circulatory paths and contributes to grasping an\nobject\u2019s formal features (such as rhythm in spatial patterns)\nand perhaps, at least derivatively, its aesthetic features (such as\nsomberness) (Sauchelli 2012a; Rasmussen 1959). These aspects of\narchitectural experience capture the immersive nature of a\nspectator\u2019s or user\u2019s relationship to a built\nstructure. Further aspects of our experience may capture the\narchitectural object\u2019s immersion in its larger\nenvironment and surroundings, its \u201clocalized nature\u201d or\ncontext and \u201csense of location\u201d (Carlson 1994). As\narchitectural objects standardly shape our actual, imagined, or\nremembered bodily engagement, so are our richest experiences of\narchitecture informed by such engagement (J. Robinson 2012).\nCentral as bodily experience may be, it cannot be the only source\nof architectural beliefs. Considering the great breadth of the\narchitectural enterprise, it may not even be the best source.  Other\nsources include access to beliefs about works through standard\nrepresentational modes that are not the works themselves, transmission\nof tacit working knowledge through apprenticeship learning, and\ncollective belief formation through client briefings and studio group\ncritical assessment (\u201ccrits\u201d). On these and other bases an\narchitectural knowledge of special character is built.\n6.2 Architectural Knowledge\nKnowledge of a building or other architectural objects follows\nwell-worn paths in some aspects of general knowledge of art. In\nparticular, architectural beliefs encompass judgments of aesthetic\nproperties of the built environment, are norm-governed in some\nfashion, and may be transmissible via testimony. Yet other aspects of\nknowing architectural objects diverge from the well-worn path, as\nreflective of special characteristics of the architectural enterprise\nand its products and consumption.\nOne traditional division of architectural knowledge promoted by\narchitectural historians, theorists, and practitioners\u2014and\nfocusing squarely on creator\u2019s knowledge\u2014has it that there\nare two basic kinds: the theoretical/historical and the practical\n(J. W. Robinson 2001). Theoretical and historical\nbrands of architectural knowledge encompass viable beliefs about\nfamiliar core concerns of architecture, including basic design\nelements of the built environment; their combinations, relations, and\nproperties; their style; external factors (social, economic, cultural,\netc.) which shape design; and historical contexts into which they\nfit. Some such beliefs are empirically supported; others\nnot. Practical brands of architectural knowledge encompass\nviable beliefs about the engineering and technical means of\nconstructing architectural objects, ensuring structural integrity, and\nguaranteeing mechanical function, socially, industrially, or\necologically beneficial use. Such beliefs\u2014particularly as\nhitched to formalized, experimental, or predictive dimensions of the\nenterprise\u2014are sometimes seen as constituting an\narchitectural science. They are typically (though not\nexclusively) empirical in character and, to some tastes, relegated to\na status of adjunct architectural knowledge, that is, useful\nfor architecture but outside the domain proper. What counts as\npractical knowledge in architecture is often seen as encompassing\nbeliefs of a largely non-aesthetic nature.\nYet other categories reflect a range of types and sources of\narchitectural knowledge. Another division distinguishes between\narchitectural beliefs associated with creators and users. My\nexperience of a built structure qua creator is perforce\ndifferent than my experience of the same structure qua user,\nand the sorts of beliefs I arrive at may differ accordingly. As\narchitect, Jones believes that an arch of one design but not another\nwill keep the bridge up; as someone strolling underneath the bridge,\nSmith believes that an arch of a different design would have been a\ngreater aesthetic success. This much accords with other artforms\nfeaturing practical functions. Further, architectural beliefs may\ndiffer by their technical or non-technical nature; by perspective and\nrole of the belief-holder; or by facts about physical experience of\nthe work or other modalities of belief acquisition.\nArchitectural knowledge in broader context. To see\nhow architectural knowledge may be similar to, or differ from,\naesthetic knowledge generally, consider two dimensions of aesthetic\nknowledge, knowing through art and knowing about art\n(Kieran and Lopes 2006). As concerns knowing through\narchitecture, cognitive content arises in reflecting\u2014to varying\ndegrees\u2014taste and style sensibilities of its creators,\nstructural properties per engineering principles deployed;\nand cultural and social values of historical, communal, and economic\ncontexts. To know a built structure in this regard is to know such\nmatters as the tradition in which it is built; design aspirations of\nthe architect and initial occupants; and intentions relative to\ncontributing to the built or natural landscape. The success of this\nthesis is predicated on successful communication through architectural\nobjects, whether as symbols or otherwise. \nArchitectural belief and knowledge have as well wholly distinctive\nfeatures, reflective of special characteristics of the domain, its\npractice, and its objects. These include:\nBeliefs about systems. Architectural objects (as wholes)\nare systems or system-like, in that they constitute sets of\ninterrelated structural components, with characteristic behavior or\nprocesses yielding outputs from inputs, and where the parts are\nconnected by distinctive structural and behavioral relations (Boyce\n1969). That we take whole architectural objects to be (or to be\nrepresented as) systems or system-like suggests how architectural\nbeliefs are distinctive among beliefs about artworks. In particular,\nwe have beliefs about architectural objects that reflect functions and\ninteractions of (1) components individually and as parts of systemic\nwholes, (2) systems as parts of broader environmental contexts, and\n(3) persons\u2019 behaviors within the systems.  Whereas the first\ntwo functional and interactional features are typical to all design,\nthe third feature marks architecture as an artform that, in providing\nan immersive and systemic physical environment, intensely draws on and\nshapes social, psychological, and economic features of experience. Our\nbeliefs about architectural objects and interactions with and in them\nare shaped correspondingly, in ways that do not arise in engagement\nwith other artforms. \nPartial and full information.  Representation in\narchitecture encompasses multiple modes, including built objects,\nphysical models, virtual models, data arrays, plans, sketches,\nphotographs, and drawings. Each such mode may be viable as\nrepresenting an architectural object just in case some\nfeatures of the object are adequately, accurately, regularly, and\noptimally represented through the mode. This view of viable\nrepresentation in architecture is at odds with the standards for such\nin other artforms. Consider a representation of the Mona Lisa. If you\ndo not have complete visual access through the representation (from\nany acceptable angle) to the full tableau, you may be said to lack\nfull acquaintance with the work through the representation, and your\nconsequent aesthetic beliefs about the Mona Lisa may be discounted\naccordingly. By contrast, if architectural beliefs required anything\nlike full acquaintance with the object or fully\ninformed testimony to be viable, our architectural beliefs would\nnot typically or frequently be viable.  Rare is the case where\nacquaintance is full or testimony fully informed\u2014even among\nthose whom we might expect to have the greatest acquaintance, such as\na built structure\u2019s architect or developer.\nSocially constructed knowledge. In architecture, as in\nother design fields, design problems are not thoroughly or fully\narticulated all at once or by any particular individual. The primary\ncomponents of design knowledge\u2014problems and their possible\nsolutions\u2014are instead distributed across persons.  This fact\nabout architectural production\u2014and, to a degree, its\nuse\u2014suggests that beliefs we form about architectural objects\nare formed amidst, and influenced by, such social relations (see \u00a78.1). Art and architecture worlds\nper se are undoubtedly not a sole source of epistemic\nnorms. Yet social relations and circumstances among\narchitecture\u2019s stakeholders present constitutive conditions for\na wide swath of architectural beliefs, suggesting at least a moderate\nsocial constructivism.\nIt may be thought that qualities of architecture such as\nsystematicity and the deeply social character of the discipline are\nimmaterial to aesthetic beliefs. However, architecture is a\nholistic enterprise: a design decision to cantilever a terrace is at\nonce of aesthetic and engineering significance. In like fashion, that\narchitectural objects constitute systems is pertinent in shaping\naesthetic beliefs because there are more and less attractive ways to\nshape the flow of persons, or even electricity, through a built\nstructure. And that architectural objects are designed through social\nprocesses has import for corresponding aesthetic beliefs. For example,\naesthetic properties of a given design are subject to crits, the very\npurpose of which is to influence the creator\u2019s further aesthetic\nbeliefs about the same design.\n6.3 Architectural Appreciation\nAs distinct from mere experience of architectural objects,\nappreciation of architectural objects brings to bear\ncognition and other inputs, such as history and context. Appreciation\ngoes beyond knowledge, too, insofar as we may know an\narchitectural object and its qualities without appreciating it. Thus,\nWinters (2007) proposes that appreciating architecture consists in\nenjoyment of architectural objects (from experience, tout\ncourt), as wed to understanding them, where the latter\nconsists in grasping their aesthetic significance in specifically\nvisual fashion, and critically assessing the judgment of architects in\naddressing design challenges. Architectural appreciation may be built\non the judgment of others; it is essential to rendering\njudgment. Accordingly, learning to appreciate architectural objects is\na cornerstone of architectural education. A key contributing feature\nin this last regard is acquiring agility with classifying in the\ndomain (Leder et al. 2004).\nThe appreciation and judgment of architectural objects are\ntypically thought to reflect aesthetic and utility-wise\nconsiderations, and engage individual perspective, experience,\nreasoning, and reflection such as we associate with appreciating and\njudging in other artforms. Drivers in appreciation and judgment\nspecial to architecture include social framing and\nenvironmental psychological factors that are a consequence of\narchitecture\u2019s intensely public nature.\nExceptionalism. One question regarding\nappreciation is whether there is a special mode attached to\narchitectural objects. We might think this is so given that, unlike\nmost arts (though very like other design forms), appreciation in\narchitecture is aesthetic and utility-oriented. A resulting\npuzzle is whether, and under what circumstances, we might have one\nwithout the other. We might think as much if, say, it is possible to\nappreciate the Roman Coliseum\u2019s stately and antique features\nwithout any appreciation of its intended function or actual use. On\nthe other hand, a view of appreciation embracing functional beauty\ntheory may suggest that the Coliseum\u2019s functional and free\nbeauty are on at least equal footing\u2014or that the\nColiseum\u2019s stately aesthetic and its role as amphitheater for\nstaging spectacles (for example) cannot be separated altogether.\nFurther questions regarding appreciation concern the relative roles\nin appreciation of individual experience of architecture, as against\nthe social or the environmental.\nIndividual Appreciation. The prevailing\nphilosophical view of architectural appreciation is a psychological\naccount with debts to the Kantian tradition: direct, immediate\naesthetic experiences of architectural objects among individuals\nconstitute the basis of appreciation. (Iseminger 1981 provides a\ngeneral aesthetics account in this vein.) A primary variant has it\nthat architectural appreciation is the product of individual cognition\nof the content, form, properties, and relations of architectural\nobjects. A recent variation suggests that, in addition to (or in\nlieu of) cognitive response, physiological experience\n(proprioception) is a central source of beliefs associated with\narchitectural appreciation. On either model, it is experience of\nindividuals that feeds and influences appreciation.\nSocial and Environmental Role in Architectural\nAppreciation. Direct, immediate individual experience is not\nthe only source of information shaping architectural\nappreciation. Considering the breadth of the architectural enterprise,\nit may not even be the best source. Others include access to\ninformation about works through standard representational modes that\nare not the works themselves (for example, drawings or photographs),\ntransmission of tacit working knowledge through apprenticeship\nlearning, and collective belief formation through client briefings and\nstudio crits.\nArchitectural appreciation is social in building on our\nunderstanding of architectural objects as it develops, and matures, in\nexperience of a built structure with and in relation to other\nindividuals and groups of people. It is also social in that we learn\nmarkers of appreciation among those with whom we share such\nexperiences or (per Scruton 1979/2013) imagine ourselves to\ndo so. Indeed, a central goal of architectural education is structured\nimparting of collective wisdom as to how to best classify\narchitectural objects and, relatedly, what the markers of appreciation\nhave looked like, or should look like\u2014as well as how they\narticulate with practical knowledge.\nFurther, architectural appreciation is environmental in\nbuilding on our understanding of architectural objects based on\nexperiences in relation to their natural and built surroundings.  On\none view, an architectural object may be more difficult to appreciate\nif we find that relation unexpected, or contrary to normative\nsensibility (Carlson 1999). If, however, appreciation does not require\nenjoyment or satisfaction of any sort\u2014and instead engages our\nunderstanding of, for example, what was intended and why\u2014we may\nwell appreciate in its own right an architectural object that has a\nsurprising, even obnoxious relation to its surroundings.\n7. Architectural Ethics\nSome problems of architectural ethics are characteristic of a range\nof typical moral dilemmas\u2014agent-centered, norms-oriented\nconcerns\u2014as may arise for architects. In addition to a\ntraditional set of questions applied to the architectural domain,\narchitectural ethics also addresses problems special to the discipline\nand practice\u2014as shaped by its social, public, practical, and\nartistic nature. \nAs conceptually prior to a normative ethics of architectural\npractice, a meta-ethics of architecture assesses alternate ethical\nmodalities, such as whether architecture might be considered moral or\nimmoral relative to its objects (built structures) or to its practices\nas a set of institutions or social phenomena. Another meta-ethical\nissue concerns whether moralism or autonomism best characterizes the\nrelationship of aesthetics to ethics, as that plays out in\narchitecture.\nEthical modalities of architecture. There are\nthree typical candidate modalities of ethics in architecture. For one,\nthere is the establishment of criteria for ethical norms of the\nenterprise such as architects in practice may observe. For example,\narchitects can craft designs in ways that lower the likelihood of cost\noverruns and enhance safety. In an interpersonal vein, architects can\nrepresent their work honestly to clients or contractors. Another\nmodality\u2014beyond enterprise-defined ethical norms\u2014is\npursuit of criteria to gauge architects as moral agents broadly\nproducing or doing good or bad in the world. For example, architects\nmay create objects that uplift or constrain individual users and\ninhabitants; other architects may promote social utility by designing\nhousing for those in need of shelter. Finally, there is the modality\nof seeking criteria to judge architectural objects as morally good or\nbad insofar as they directly produce pleasure or pain. As an\nindirect example, a hospital design is intended to facilitate\nthe minimizing of pain, by fostering environmental conditions\nconducive to excellence in health care and patient well-being. As a\nmore direct case, a bus shelter is intended to reduce exposure to the\nelements and corresponding discomfort. This last candidate may be\nattractive if we see architecture primarily as a product rather than\nas a practice; it is noxious if we are unwilling to assign moral\nvalues to artifacts as we do to actions or their properties. A built\nstructure might be inhumane in that it is bleak or uninhabitable,\nthough it does not follow that the structure itself bears inhumane\nvalues. \nValue Interaction. Vitruvian principles underlying\nmuch of architectural theory suggest a tendency to link the aesthetic\nand the utility-promoting. So, too, functional beauty theory\nrecommends that aesthetic and ethical considerations are linked in\narchitecture. To crystallize the matter, we may ask if it is possible\nfor a built structure to be good though not aesthetically so. The\nquestion as to how aesthetic and ethical value might be related is a\nsubject of broader concern, with a \u201cmoralist\u201d stance that\nsays the two sorts of value are or should be connected (Carroll 1996,\nGaut 1998) and an \u201cautonomist\u201d stance that takes the two\nas (or better off as) independent (Anderson and Dean 1998, Kieran\n2001).\nIn this debate, architecture would seem a promising domain in which\nto find robust relations. At a moralist extreme, there is the\nsuggestion\u2014supported by some traditions in architectural theory\n(Pugin 1841, Ruskin 1849)\u2014that aesthetic tasks in architecture\nsimply are ethical tasks, reflecting ethical choices.  One\nprominent moralist perspective locates the ethical element of\naesthetic architectural choice in obligations to a sort of honesty, in\ndesigning works that accurately represent underlying structural\nprinciples or operational capacities. Harries (1997) and Scruton\n(1979/2013) arrive at similar ethical commitments to architectural\ndesign as expressive in a particular fashion, though of shared\ncommunity values, rather than of function or structural features.\nFrom another angle, moralists point to the emotional impact of built\nenvironments as indicative of a union of the aesthetically gripping\nand morally compelling (Ginsburg 1994), though it may be noted that\neven where we detect such a union we need not judge the aesthetics of\nthe architectural object on the basis of any ethical import so\ncommunicated.\nAt the other extreme, autonomists propose that problems of ethics\nand aesthetics neither need arise at once, nor need be resolved at\nonce, in architectural design. If we see a correlation in some\narchitectural objects of ethically and aesthetically compelling design\nsolutions, we see in other objects no correlation at all. Thus, the\nmodern city is replete with instances of built structures that are\nwell-functioning, high-utility, and facilitate much good in the world\nyet meet no one\u2019s standards of aesthetically worthy design.\nThere is good reason to uncouple these values just in case they\nmust conflict. Suppose there is an ethical premium, for\nexample, on the need to create environmentally sustaining structures,\nand that we identify resolutions of that problem as generally bearing\nthe greatest mark of moral worth. Suppose further that crafting the\noptimal moral solution (vis-\u00e0-vis the environment)\nalways generates the most unattractive design\u2014and that the\ninverse holds as well (the better the design aesthetically, the worse\nthe design for the environment). Then a connection between ethics and\naesthetics in architecture seems improbable.\nA third position altogether proposes a pluralism. Sometimes ethical\nand aesthetic value march hand-in-hand, other times not\u2014and\ntheir ways of matching up are diverse and run in various\ndirections. So one architectural design may be aesthetically\ncompelling as it reflects its ethically upstanding character, whereas\nanother design may be aesthetically compelling as it reflects its\nethically deficient character. What is required for cases of this last\nsort is that the evaluator can identify the aesthetic success as\ngrounded, per functional beauty theory, in effective\nexpression of the structure\u2019s ethically deficient function\n(Sauchelli 2012b).  An even more generalized pluralism would suggest\nthat a wide range of aesthetic and ethical valences can be matched up\nin different ways; we might value a war memorial for the way it grimly\nexpresses the horrors of war.\nTraditional questions of architectural ethics. One\nreason that architectural ethics is central to philosophy of\narchitecture is that architects\u2019 actions bear great influence\nover other people\u2019s moral lives. Architects design structures\nand environments for people, with concomitant effects on personal\nbehavior, capacity to choose courses of action, and ability to satisfy\npreferences, visit harm, generate benefit, or exercise rights. As\narchitects\u2019 acts shape spaces, boundaries, and pathways that\nstructure individual behaviors and social acts, they prompt normative\nethical exploration along traditional lines.\nTo begin with, a traditional architectural ethics requires an\naccount of architectural responsibilities. Any such account\nshould outline architects\u2019 obligations to other persons, ethical\nstandards on which such obligations may be based, how to ensure such\nstandards might be met, and any other sorts of obligations architects\nmight have, as for example, to historic preservation or environmental\nprotection. As concerns obligations to persons, the range of\nstakeholders in architecture is great, hence ethical responsibility is\ndiffuse.\nA further set of questions concerns rights.  It is\nrelatively novel to speak of authorial or community rights in\narchitecture; owner or client rights are historically parasitic on\nproperty or sovereign rights. Other possibilities include rights of\ndevelopers, builders, engineers, environments, and societies.  As that\nlist grows, two further questions concern the sorts of rights that can\nbe attributed to such parties or entities, and the criteria for\ndistributing and prioritizing them given aesthetic as well as moral\nconsiderations.\nArchitectural utility is familiar as a Vitruvian concept\nbut has a wholly other sense in an agent-centered normative ethics,\nwith a possible moral weighting not found in classic architectural\ntheory. Guidelines are needed to determine the usefulness of\narchitectural goods such as built structures, restorations,\nreconstructions, or plans. These might include their social character,\nor individual preferences of the architect, owner, end-users, or\npublic. A utilitarian approach to architectural ethics is attractive\nin capturing the aims of architecture to promote well-being, and\nrelying on a ready marker of architectural value. However, it also\ndiscounts other traditional architectural imperatives such as a\nVitruvian-style pluralist may honor, including beauty and structural\nintegrity (Spector 2001). \nFinally, a traditionalist picture of architectural ethics requires\nan account of virtues in the domain (though these may be\northogonal to normative ethics). Here is potential consonance with the\nVitruvian tradition (and similarly virtue-oriented non-Western\ntraditions)\u2014if we see the \u201cgood\u201d, morally educated\narchitect\u2019s virtue and character as our best guarantee of proper\nand productive weighting of values under differing circumstances\n(Spector 2001).\nFuture-Focused Architectural Ethics. The focus of\nethical rights and responsibilities in architecture is typically taken\nas relative to present or past. Thus, we speak of obligations to\ndesign and build in ethically responsible fashion, or preserve past\narchitectural objects. There are future-focused obligations, as\nwell. Sustainable design is forward-looking even as it is centered on\nwhat we design and build today. Further ethical issues may arise\nrelative to future architectural objects. As to obligations to future\narchitectural objects, we see as much in the short-term\ninstance of planning around near-future buildings. More puzzling is\nwhether we might have \u201clong-haul\u201d future-facing\nobligations\u2014apart from utility or prudential\nconsiderations\u2014in planning, for example, new cities or\naccommodations to climate change.\nSpecial ethical questions of architecture.\nArchitectural practice generates special moral issues as befit its\nproper, idiosyncratic features, distinctive among the arts, the\nprofessions, and social practices. Most notably, an array of ethical\nissues of social import arises from architecture\u2019s commitments\nto creation of a socially beneficial and functional art. Such issues\ninclude the nature of \u201cbetter\u201d housing (and under varying\nconditions), what (if anything) makes housing an obligation, and ways\nthat such an obligation may accrue to, or be satisfied by,\narchitects. Yet other ethical issues special to architecture range\nover matters of personal and social spaces and the articulations\nthereof, including criteria for designing around concerns related to\nprivacy, accessibility (for the public generally and handicapped in\nparticular), respecting community and neighborly preferences, and\npromoting civic values.\nOther ethical matters special to architecture are particularly\nvisible in global perspective. For example, there is inequitable\ndistribution of housing across the developed and developing nations,\nand part of the solution may be architectural (Caicco 2005).  Further,\narchitecture incurs special environmental obligations given that waste\nand degradation affect, and are affected by, architectural design. One\nconceptual challenge of sustainability facing architects is to\ndetermine whether development is, in principle, a countervailing\ninterest. This is to ask, once environmental obligations are defined,\nhow they may be factored into or weighed against infrastructural and\ndesign interests and preferences.\nProfessional Ethics. Architectural professional\nethics focuses on architects\u2019 moral choices in the context of\npractice (Wasserman, Sullivan, and Palermo 2000; T. Fisher\n2010). Professional ethical codes govern conduct in (and thereby\nprotect) the architectural profession and avert problems related to\nbusiness, fiduciary, insurance, or liability functions; the design\nfunction is an ethical focus relative to disability. Architectural law\nhighlights professional ethics matters as concern property, liability,\nand honesty. The law clarifies responsibilities among parties to\narchitectural practice; defines who or what in commercial\narchitectural interactions has moral agency\u2014hence rights; and\ndescribes utility-wise or financial measures of distribution in\narchitecture.  Legal regulations and judgments prompt conceptual\nquestions regarding such issues as intellectual property in\narchitecture, architects as arbitrators, and architects\u2019\nresponsibilities to others (S. Fisher 2000a).\nIntellectual Property.  One conceptual issue concerning\narchitectural intellectual property is how such rights are to be\nweighed against other sorts of property rights, such as domestic or\ncommercial rights. A further issue is determined on the basis of\njudging architecture to be a service or product. Taking architecture\nas service means that architects do not have a stake on\ncopyright, as they would then be creators-by-contract; tradition has\nit that rights to expression of ideas so created accrue to the\ncontracting party. Taking architecture as product supports\narchitects\u2019 claim to copyright, given that expression is their\ncreation\u2014whatever services are performed (Greenstreet 1998;\nCushman and Hedemann 1995). Copyright raises other concerns. Even as\nthe law may license creation of an architectural object reflecting\ncore design aspects found in another object created by a different\narchitect, we may find morally blameworthy any cognizant\n\u201cborrowing\u201d without attribution or\npermission. Alternatively, we might view this as a routine episode in\nthe history of architectural copying without attribution or\npermission. The challenge is to define relevant obligations of one\narchitect to others, present or past.\nArchitect as judge in owner-contractor disputes.\nArchitects have a dual role, serving as designer and administrator of\narchitectural projects, and in this capacity may adjudicate between\nowner and contractor in matters of dispute.  Standard issues concern\nconflicts of interest, grounds for adjudication, and criteria of\nfairness. Ethical issues of a particularly architectural\nstripe include the degree to which specifications are poorly satisfied\nsuch as warrants reckoning; maintenance of fealty to owners\u2019\ninterests alongside fairness to contractors and to satisfactory\nrealization of one\u2019s own design; and identification of virtues\nappropriate to judgment in design-related disputes, along with facets\nof being an architect that promote (or limit) such virtues.\nResponsibility to others\u2019 design. Architectural\nobjects often develop over time in cumulative and mutable fashion,\nthrough additions and alterations that\u2014perhaps more frequently\nthan not\u2014change the design of a different, original architect\n(or that of a prior alteration). For any particular changes, or in\nconsideration of design changes overall, we may stipulate obligations\nto respect original or prior intent and execution. One brand of such\nobligations, recognized in historic preservation and landmark laws,\nrequires that aesthetic concerns in the public interest trump private\ninterests. Key conceptual questions concern how to determine the\nsource and conditions of any such obligations\u2014and the sorts of\nresponsibilities architects should have to existing structures. Those\nresponsibilities may extend to commitment to the integrity of work by\nfellow architects.\n8. Architecture and Social and Political Philosophy\n8.1 Socially Constitutive Features of Architecture\nWhile all artforms admit of a certain social character,\narchitecture enjoys a particularly social nature, and may even be said\nto be an intrinsically social artform. There are two\nprominent candidate reasons as to why this is so. For one, a central\naim of architecture is to design shelter and so meet a variety of\nsocial needs. For another, architecture as practice is a social\nprocess or activity as it engages people in interpersonal relations of\na social cast.\nThe first candidate reason stands or falls on whether, in\nfulfilling social needs, architecture is thereby rendered a social\nart. For an artform to be intrinsically social, any such need\nfulfilled should be critical rather than discretionary or\nextravagant. Thus, for example, addressing housing demands overall\nmeets the criticality test\u2014though addressing design demands for\na third home does not. The first reason looks right because architects\noften integrate social needs into design thinking. Armed with socially\nminded intentions, they create built structures which serve myriad\nsocial ends. A difficulty arises, however, in consistently upholding\nsuch intentions as a mark of the social if (a) such intentions are\nunclear from experiencing architectural objects, instantiations, or\nrepresentations thereof, (b) built structures are repurposed, or (c)\nthere are architectural objects with no corresponding relevant\nintentions. (As an instance, we might consider \u201cfound\u201d\narchitectural objects like inhabited caves.)\nA second candidate reason that architecture is a social art is that\nprocesses of making architecture are thoroughly and ineluctably social\nphenomena, constituted by interactions of social groupings created and\ngoverned by social conventions and arrangements. On this view, the\nsocial nature of architecture consists in the status of the discipline\nas shaped by social convention\u2014where such convention is\ndesignated by, and guides actions of, architects and other relevant\nagents. (This reason directly links the social nature of architecture\nto its social impact\u2014hence to sociology of architecture; see \u00a78.2.) Architectural phenomena are\nsocial, then, because they occur as a result of contracts, meetings,\nfirms, charettes, crits, juries, projects, competitions, exhibitions,\npartnerships, professional organizations, negotiations, workflow\norganization, division of labor, and myriad other conventional and\nagreement-bound purposive actions and groupings of architects and\nother architectural stakeholders. One might object that, on an\ninstitutional theory, all artforms are social in just these\nways. However, as played out in art worlds, institutional theories\ntell us what counts as an art object rather than how such objects are\nconstituted to begin with. Proponents of this candidate must rule out\na na\u00efve architecture scenario, the possibility of a lone\narchitect who has no socially significant engagements such as shape\nher creations.\nEither view is temporally sensitive. These parameters and how they\nconstitute architecture\u2019s sociality will change over time, along\nwith vicissitudes in social needs, conventions, and relations.\n8.2 Socially Efficacious Features on, and of, Architecture\nArchitecture as object and pursuit produces a great range of\neffects on social structures and phenomena, in particularly acute\nfashion in relation to housing, land use, and urban planning. In turn,\narchitecture is shaped by such social concerns as scarcity, justice,\nand social relations and obligations. Some of this shaping results\nfrom social group and institution requirements for space and the\nstructured organization thereof, to promote group or institutional\nfunction and identity (Halbwachs 1938). In addition, other social\nrequirements stem from architecture\u2019s roles in meeting concerns\nand needs for society as a whole.\nCausal direction. We might see social forces as\nprimarily shaping architecture or else architecture as primarily\nshaping social forces. Proponents of architecture as\n\u201cshaper\u201d suggest that architecture provides a means of\norganizing society, a core Modernist claim but also a thesis of\nbroader currency. Detractors counter that we cannot shape society\nthrough the built environment\u2014or we ought not do so. What rests\non directionality is how we parse not only theoretical relations but\nalso practical consequences and perspectives concerning a host of\nsocial phenomena. To take one example, how we gauge and address the\npossibilities that architecture offers relative to social inequality\nis likely a function of whether architecture contributes to, or\ninstead reflects, social classes and social hierarchies. We might\nwonder whether architects can design so as to promote class\nequality\u2014or solidarity, justice, autonomy, or other social\nphenomena as we might foster.\nOn a third, holistic option, causality runs in both directions. Two\nexamples of such are (a) systems analyses, which take built structures\nas social systems that contribute to social function, and (b)\nurban sociology, which takes the city en gros as social\nstructuring of space which shapes its habitants, who in turn shape the\ncity (Simmel 1903). As expanded to environmental sociology,\nthe suggestion is that built environments promote patterns of living,\nworking, shopping, and otherwise conducting commerce among groups and\nin relation to other individuals.\nOther social science domains suggest attendant conceptual\nissues. For example, one sociological perspective takes relations of\nindividuals and groups to built structures to be analogous to\nconsumption (Essbach 2004); we may ask whether architectural objects\nenjoy a reception of this particular social sort, a range of such\nsorts (perhaps as context-dependent), or perhaps, on an individualist\nread, no sort we would call \u201csocial\u201d. For another,\nsociology of architecture also studies the profession: the backgrounds\nand relations of architects and other stakeholders, norms governing\nbehavior, and social structures of an architecture world constitute a\nspecies of artworld. This last suggestion prompts the question as to\nwhat influence we should attribute to an architecture world on the\nstatus of architectural objects. The architecture world\nraises issues beyond those motivating Danto or Dickie, engaging many\nparties whose interests and preferences are not primarily aesthetic or\neven economic but driven by social, commercial, engineering, planning,\nand various other factors. For a third, a Science and Technology\nStudies perspective (Gieryn 2002) investigates how\narchitecture\u2014primarily in its optimization focus, qua\nengineered technology\u2014shapes knowledge formation (for example,\nin laboratory or university design) and organizes social behavior (for\nexample, in architecture for tourism or retail sales). Conceptual\nissues here include whether there are global principles of\noptimization of architectural design for social advancement, and what\nsorts of moral constraints are appropriate to such optimization.\n8.3 Architecture and the Political\nThat architecture has some political aspects is a widely\nheld, if not entirely uncontested thesis, with weaker and stronger\nvariants. One weak version suggests that designing built structures\nentails political engagement through interactions of architects and\nthe public. For example, architects solicit political support of\ngovernment officials for development projects, governments engage\narchitects to design built structures that express political\nprogrammatic messages, and citizens do political battle amongst\nthemselves over architectural designs or preservation decisions. A\nstronger version highlights a possible role for architecture as an\ninstrument of politics. Thus, Sparshott (1994) characterizes\narchitecture as \u201c\u2026above all the coercive organization of\nsocial space\u201d. In other words, designing built structures\nentails political engagement through the control by force of behaviors\nand attitudes of people who interact with those structures.\nThat architecture might have any significant role in politics, or\nthe other way around, calls for explanation. One account stresses that\nthe two domains are oriented around utility-maximization.  Utility\ncriteria deployed to judge the worth of architectural objects are\nexemplary subjects of democratic debate, policy analysis, or community\nconsensus. The appeal to utility is an advocacy strategy for\narchitectural design that dates to Bentham\u2019s Panopticon\n(1787) or before. Further, traditional architectural promotion of\nurban and social planning may be linked to social utility criteria for\narchitectural quality; that relationship might run in either\ndirection. In distinct progressive and utopian traditions in\narchitectural thought (Eaton 2002), advancement of social utility is a\ncentral motivation in architectural attempts to realize idealistic\nvisions of modes of living and societal organization. (For a critique,\nsee Harries 1997.)\nPower, control, and change. Architecture\u2019s\npolitical cast is also manifest in use as a means of social\ncontrol. This is not an obvious use in societies where individuals\nfreely choose dwellings or other structures with which they\ninteract. The less choice available in this regard, the greater the\npossibility of defining people\u2019s choices (a) concerning the\nbuilt environment they occupy and (b) as a function of that\nenvironment. Prominent such architectural types include prisons and\nrefugee camps. Some see potential in architecture for more globally\npromoting maintenance of power through behavior regulating norms that\nsuch built structures represent (Foucault 1975).\nEven in generally free or open social settings, though, at the\nlevel of urban planning architecture indirectly determines behavior in\npolitically shaped ways. Architects and others planning urban or other\ndensely settled environments take into account such political aims as\nhonoring community values, promoting civic virtues, maximizing social\nutility, fulfilling professional or public responsibilities, and\nrespecting citizen or leadership preferences (Haldane 1990, Paden\n2001, Thompson 2012). The politically hued results of such planning\nand design efforts, whether pursued in authoritative, consultative, or\nparticipatory processes, are architectural objects that change,\nencourage, or reward particular behaviors.\nIdeology and agency. Architecture is also used to\npromote political views, culture, or control, by conveying symbolic\nmessages of power, nationalism, liberation, cooperation, justice, or\nother political themes or notions (Wren c1670s). One issue concerns\nthe architect\u2019s agency in promoting an official political\nideology. In government commissions, the architect generally cedes\ndesign control, at a certain point, to the government. Yet the\narchitect is the creator of record.  This leaves open whether\narchitects so engaged are promoting the given ideology\u2014or else\nmerely acting as proxies for such promotion. It may seem odd to\nsuggest that, from an aesthetic standpoint the design is of architect\nX but from a political standpoint the same design is not\nattributable to X.\nPolitical agency among architects is a special version of the more\ngeneral issue of architect agency relative to clients, including as\nwell corporate and individual clients. Architects have obligations to\nthe client\u2019s aesthetic and utility concerns, and in virtue of\nthose obligations, the responsibility, blame, and praise for a given\narchitectural object cannot be wholly attached to the architect\nalone. One question is what scenarios or conditions would need to\npertain to justify apportioning more or less agency\u2014and,\ncorrespondingly, political or moral responsibility\u2014to the\narchitect or to the client, in design and build phases of realizing an\narchitectural object. The phases matter. The design phase appears, at\nleast initially, to be the agency-wise province of the architect, and\nany post-build phase appears to be generally the province of the\nclient and any relevant user-base (until any such renovation or\nrepurposing as may occur). What happens in phases en route to\npost-build is murkier, though.\n9. Further Issues in Philosophy of Architecture\nArchitectural Failure. Failed architecture is not\na straightforward subspecies of failed art or failed\nartifacts. Architectural objects may rate as aesthetic disasters yet\nin some overall sense as successes, unlike non-architecture art\nobjects. And architectural objects may cease to function\u2014or\nnever have functioned at all\u2014yet count as overall successes,\nunlike a range of (though not all) non-architecture artifacts. Another\nfeature of architectural failure\u2014in keeping with general design\nphenomena\u2014is that architectural objects may count as successes\nor failures depending on different states of affairs, context, or\nremarkably small differences.  Thus, a given architectural object may\nbe a failure as an active and integral built structure but not as a\nruin (or vice-versa). This suggests that background\nintentions may matter at one early stage, and less so at later stages\nin the life of a built structure\u2014and that failure may have one\ncriterion for architectural abstracta and other criteria for\ncounterpart concreta. Further, among architectural objects with\nstandard, closely related variants, some may fail while others\nsucceed\u2014perhaps because of a minor distinction such as a\ngarishly painted exterior. A viable account of architectural failure\naccommodates such features or else devolves failure to the level of\nsome single dimension of architectural objects, such as their putative\nnature as art objects (failed or otherwise).\nCorruption, Ruins, and Preservation. Architectural\nobjects as physically instantiated are corrupted or fall apart over\ntime, and may develop new forms in disrepair or as ruins. From an\ninclusivist, concretist standpoint, a ruin is not any lesser an\narchitectural object than its corresponding newly built structure. An\ninclusivism is available to the abstractist, too, though she will not\nsee them as the same object\u2014and will rate them both as somehow\nlesser than the originary object. If we take them as the same\narchitectural objects, we need an account as to how they relate to one\nanother\u2014apparently not by reference to intentions. Even if an\narchitect designed a path to a ruin state, the actual ruin-state would\nlikely take on a wholly different shape. Some may take this as an\nargument against inclusivism.\nArchitects typically embrace the Vitruvian premium on\nfirmitas and reasonably assume that built objects should\nendure\u2014and that they serve intended functions for as long as is\ndesirable. That pair of assumptions in design thinking is at odds with\nconcretism, given corruption and decay of physical constructions as\nwell as routine repurposing in the lives of built structures.  The\nfirst assumption is consistent with an abstractist vision of\neverlasting architectural objects. Endurance of serving intended\nfunctions is another story: for architectural abstracta, stipulation\nof repurposing may not change the nature of a given, selfsame\nobject. Depending on degrees of stringency in defining an\nobject\u2019s parameters, corresponding changes in design may bring\nabout an entirely new object or nearby counterpart.\nCorruption brings not only total destruction and absence of\npreviously intact built structures, but also enduring ruins or flawed,\ndamaged structures. There is a longstanding premium on ruins in\narchitectural culture as promoting historical perspective, nostalgia,\nand at least one style (Romanticism). Yet ruins fit awkwardly, if at\nall, into standard architectural ontologies. The cultural premium is\nhard to explain for the abstractist, for whom ruins represent\ndefective physical instantiations, which are already substandard in\nthe abstractist worldview. They are even harder to match up with a\nconcretist account as there aren\u2019t underlying creative\nintentions to build (except in ironic or kitsch building of \u201cnew\nruins\u201d). Corresponding intentions instead typically concern\npreservation, restoration, or elimination.  Alternatively, Bicknell\n(2014) suggests we think of ruins as part-objects that, along with\nfull-blown \u201carchitectural ghosts\u201d, represent past objects\nin their intact, built glory and as corresponded to creator\nintent. \nPreservation and conservation possibilities prompt additional\nconsiderations, such as whether restoration or maintenance of a built\nstructure sustains it as an authentic architectural whole\u2014and if\nthis is independent of functional integrity, or holds for wholesale\nreconstructions (Wicks 1994); what conditions warrant preserving or\nconserving a built structure; and what principles guide warranted\nalterations or completions of built structures\u2014and whether other\nconsiderations may include creativity, fancy, or sensitivity to\ncontemporary needs and context (Capdevila-Werning 2013). As concerns\ncompleting unfinished structures, one issue is whether it is possible\nto discern original design intent altogether. Taken together with\ncontemporary norms that shape our understanding of past architecture\n(Spector 2001), preservation and conservation are at least partly\nbound to present-day design conceptions.\nBuilt Versus Natural Environment. We typically\ntake built and natural environments to be clearly distinct. This\ndistinction does at least two kinds of work in philosophy of\narchitecture. For one, it helps establish what sorts of things we\nwould discount as architecture even on an inclusivist\nconception\u2014and even there, we might accept lived-in caves as\nfound architecture but reject most other elements of the\nnatural environment as non-architecture (because neither built nor\nfound). For another, we get a defined sense of natural contexts into\nwhich built environments fit (or not), without which any such notions\nof fit are incoherent. If this is a viable (and desirable)\ndistinction, it is perhaps less clear in what it consists. One\ncandidate view is that we may distinguish the kinds of environments by\ntheir different sorts of objects and properties: we find columns in\nbuilt environments and trees in natural environments and never the\nother way around. Alternatives highlight the ascribable functions and\nintent that mark built environments but not natural environments; or\ndifferent sorts of behavior and obligations attached to the two kinds\nof environments. While an artifact-centered view of architecture\nweighs in favor of functions and intent as the most relevant\ndistinction, decaying value of design intent over the life of a built\nstructure may give pause.\nHuman and Non-Human Architecture. What we\ntypically refer to as \u201carchitecture\u201d is human\narchitecture. This raises the question as to whether human\narchitecture is assimilable to a larger class of animal-built\nstructures.  That would suggest, in turn, that we could assess human\narchitecture\u2014including settlement patterns, individual\nstructures, and built community environments\u2014in ecological,\nanimal behavioral, and evolutionary terms (Hansell 2007). If these are\nfundamental vantage points for understanding human architecture, that\nwould suggest a need to translate all going accounts\u2014whether\nfocused on aesthetics, utility, or other concerns\u2014into\ncorresponding biological terms. One way to resist this move is to mark\nhuman architecture as a particularly human endeavor and\ncreation\u2014likely by reference to intentionality, as flows into\naesthetic focus. However, this may just forestall the question as to\nhow to account for that wrinkle\u2014a particularly talented\nanimal builder with notable design intent\u2014in the larger story of\nanimal builders most of whom have less or no such intent.\nEnvironmental Psychology as Magic Pill. Another\nscientific challenge to traditional philosophy of architecture emerges\nin environmental psychology, which identifies ways that environmental\nfactors such as color, shape, light, and circulatory pattern shape our\nvisual reactions and behavioral patterns within and around the built\nenvironment. From such empirical insights, we can fashion constraints\non architectural design principles that guide architectural creation,\nand devise corresponding solutions to particular design problems. As\narchitects learn to exploit this information to advance design, we may\nask whether an architectural object may be optimized by the lights of\nenvironmental psychology yet\u2014and even\nconsequently\u2014deficient in some other, architecturally\ncentral respect. Satisfying an architectural object\u2019s intended\nfunction or maximizing its utility may well include, or be advanced\nby, keen attention to environmental factors that influence attitudes\nto and use of that object. By contrast, moral or aesthetic\ndeficiencies where environmental conditions are optimal seem real\npossibilities. A resulting question is whether, and to what degree, we\ncould or should abandon moral or aesthetic drivers in architectural\ndesign if in the future we could design architectural objects to\noptimize environmental factors and so meet cognitive and emotional\nneeds, thereby enhancing an architectural object\u2019s reception but\nat moral or aesthetic expense.",
