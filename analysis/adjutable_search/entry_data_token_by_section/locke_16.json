    "main_text": "The Two Treatises Of Government || Of Property\n4.4 Of Property\n\nChapter 5 \u201cOf Property\u201d is one of the most famous,\ninfluential and important chapters in the Second Treatise of\nGovernment. Indeed, some of the most controversial issues about\nthe Second Treatise come from varying interpretations of it.\nIn this chapter Locke, in effect, describes the evolution of the state\nof nature to the point where it becomes expedient for those in it to\nfound a civil government. So, it is not only an account of the nature\nand origin of private property but leads up to the explanation of why\ncivil government replaces the state of nature (see the section on\n property\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s political philosophy).\n\nIn discussing the origin of private property Locke begins by noting\nthat God gave the earth to all men in common. Thus there is a question\nabout how private property comes to be. Locke finds it a serious\ndifficulty. He points out, however, that we are supposed to make use\nof the earth \u201cfor the best advantage of life and\nconvenience\u201d (Treatises II.5.25). What then is the\nmeans to appropriate property from the common store? Locke argues that\nprivate property does not come about by universal consent. If one had\nto go about and ask everyone if one could eat these berries, one would\nstarve to death before getting everyone\u2019s agreement. Locke holds\nthat we have property in our own person. And the labor of our body and\nthe work of our hands properly belong to us. So, when one picks up\nacorns or berries, they thereby belong to the person who picked them\nup. There has been some controversy about what Locke means by\n\u201clabor\u201d. Daniel Russell claims that for Locke, labor is a\ngoal-directed activity that converts materials that might meet our\nneeds into resources that actually do (Russell 2004). This\ninterpretation of what Locke means by \u201clabor\u201d connects\nnicely with his claim that we have a natural law obligation first to\npreserve ourselves and then to help in the preservation and\nflourishing of others.\n\nOne might think that one could then acquire as much as one wished, but\nthis is not the case. Locke introduces at least two important\nqualifications on how much property can be acquired. The first\nqualification has to do with waste. Locke writes:\n\n\nAs much as anyone can make use of to any advantage of life before it\nspoils, so much by his labor he may fix a property in; whatever is\nbeyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others.\n(Treatises II.5.31)\n\n\nSince originally, populations were small and resources great, living\nwithin the bounds set by reason, there would be little quarrel or\ncontention over property, for a single man could make use of only a\nvery small part of what was available.\n\nNote that Locke has, thus far, been talking about hunting and\ngathering, and the kinds of limitations which reason imposes on the\nkind of property that hunters and gatherers hold. In the next section\nhe turns to agriculture and the ownership of land and the kinds of\nlimitations there are on that kind of property. In effect, we see the\nevolution of the state of nature from a hunter/gatherer kind of\nsociety to that of a farming and agricultural society. Once again it\nis labor which imposes limitations upon how much land can be enclosed.\nIt is only as much as one can work. But there is an additional\nqualification. Locke says:\n\n\nNor was this appropriation of any parcel of land, by\nimproving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still\nenough, and as good left; and more than the as yet unprovided could\nuse. So that, in effect, there was never the less for others because\nof his inclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another\ncan make use of, does as good as take nothing at all. No body could\nconsider himself injured by the drinking of another man, though he\ntook a good draught, who had a whole river of the same water left to\nquench his thirst: and the case of land and water, where there is\nenough, is perfectly the same. (Treatises II.5.33)\n\n\nThe next stage in the evolution of the state of nature involves the\nintroduction of money. Locke remarks that:\n\n\n\u2026 before the desire of having more than one needed had altered\nthe intrinsic value of things, which depends only on their usefulness\nto the life of man; or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow\nmetal, which would keep without wasting or decay, should be worth a\ngreat piece of flesh, or a whole heap of corn; though men had a right\nto appropriate by their labor, each one of himself, as much of the\nthings of nature, as he could use; yet this could not be much, nor to\nthe prejudice of others, where the same plenty was left to those who\nwould use the same industry. (Treatises II.5.37)\n\n\nSo, before the introduction of money, there was a degree of economic\nequality imposed on mankind both by reason and the barter system. And\nmen were largely confined to the satisfaction of their needs and\nconveniences. Most of the necessities of life are relatively short\nlived\u2014berries, plums, venison and so forth. One could reasonably\nbarter one\u2019s berries for nuts which would last not weeks but\nperhaps a whole year. And says Locke:\n\n\n\u2026if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, pleased with\nits color, or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a sparkling\npebble or diamond, and keep those by him all his life, he invaded not\nthe right of others, he might heap up as much of these durable things\nas he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his property not lying\nin the largeness of his possessions, but the perishing of anything\nuselessly in it. (Treatises II.5.146)\n\n\nThe introduction of money is necessary for the differential increase\nin property, with resulting economic inequality. Without money there\nwould be no point in going beyond the economic equality of the earlier\nstage. In a money economy, different degrees of industry could give\nmen vastly different proportions.\n\n\nThis partage of things in an inequality of private possessions, men\nhave made practicable out of the bounds of society, and without\ncompact, only by putting a value on gold and silver, and tacitly\nagreeing to the use of money: for in governments, the laws regulate\nthe rights of property, and the possession of land is determined by\npositive constitutions. (Treatises II.5.50)\n\n\nThe implication is that it is the introduction of money, which causes\ninequality, which in turn multiplies the causes of quarrels and\ncontentions and increased numbers of violations of the law of nature.\nThis leads to the decision to create a civil government. Before\nturning to the institution of civil government, however, we should ask\nwhat happens to the qualifications on the acquisition of property\nafter the advent of money? One answer proposed by C. B. Macpherson in\nThe Political Theory of Possessive Individualism is that the\nqualifications are completely set aside, and we now have a system for\nthe unlimited acquisition of private property. This does not seem to\nbe correct. It seems plain, rather, that at least the non-spoilage\nqualification is satisfied, because money does not spoil. The other\nqualifications may be rendered somewhat irrelevant by the advent of\nthe conventions about property adopted in civil society. This leaves\nopen the question of whether Locke approved of these changes.\nMacpherson, who takes Locke to be a spokesman for a proto-capitalist\nsystem, sees Locke as advocating the unlimited acquisition of wealth.\nJames Tully, on the other side, in A Discourse of Property\nholds that Locke sees the new conditions, the change in values and the\neconomic inequality which arise as a result of the advent of money, as\nthe fall of man. Tully sees Locke as a persistent and powerful critic\nof self-interest. This remarkable difference in interpretation has\nbeen a significant topic for debates among scholars over the last\nforty years. Though the Second Treatise of Government may\nleave this question difficult to determine, one might consider\nLocke\u2019s remark in Some Thoughts Concerning Education\nthat\n\n\nCovetousness and the desire to having in our possession and our\ndominion more than we have need of, being the root of all evil, should\nbe early and carefully weeded out and the contrary quality of being\nready to impart to others inculcated. (G&T 1996: 81)\n\n\nLet us then turn to the institution of civil government.\n",
