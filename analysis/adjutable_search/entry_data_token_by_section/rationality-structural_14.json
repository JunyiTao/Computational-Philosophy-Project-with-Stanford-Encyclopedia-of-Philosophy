    "main_text": "The Normative Significance of Structural Rationality || Transparency and Apparent Reasons Accounts\n3.4 The Theoretical Options\n\nTo summarize, the debate on the normativity of rationality is often\ncentred around two theoretical options. One is to preserve the\nnormativity of rationality by defending the claim that there\nnecessarily are reasons to conform to structural requirements. The\nother is to deny this claim, and abandon the view that rationality is\nnormative. As we have seen, both options face significant challenges.\nProponents of the first view must explain why their views do not\nentail implausible forms of detachment, why the reasons they allude to\nexist, and why they are of the right kind. Proponents of the second\nview must explain why rationality seems normative when it isn\u2019t.\nMore specifically, proponents of the second view need to explain both\nwhy describing someone as irrational amounts to a serious form of\ncriticism if there is no reason to avoid irrationality, and how\nrequirements of structural rationality can count as\nrequirements if there\u2019s no sense in which we have\nreason to comply with them (and if they also aren\u2019t\n\u201cinstitutional\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d requirements\nlike the requirements of a social club or 19th century\netiquette). In addition, they face an especially strong challenge to\nsay what unites structural requirements as such, as they cannot to\naccount for the unity of structural rationality by appeal to the\nreasons that support it.\n\nThere is a third option to deal with the issues discussed in this\nsection, which is to dispense with structural requirements of\nrationality (\u00a72.4) and adopt the view (briefly discussed in\n\u00a71.3) that structural irrationality is to be explained in terms\nof substantive requirements of rationality, understood as requirements\nto respond correctly to reasons, alone. As its proponents have\nemphasized, this view has the benefits of preserving the idea that\nrationality is normative, while avoiding the problems that arise with\nassuming that there are reasons to comply with structural\nrequirements. It is not troubled by detachment worries and can dismiss\nthe why-be-rational challenge as an illegitimate request for a reason\nto do what we have reason to do. It is well-positioned to explain the\ncriticizability of irrationality and the unity of rationality. But as\nwe have seen already, it faces its own challenges. As noted at the\nbeginning of this entry (\u00a71.1), distinguishing between reasons\nand requirements of structural rationality gave us a way to explain\nhow one\u2019s holding one attitude can make it the case that one\nholds another attitude, one is irrational, without allowing\nthe attitudes one has (no matter how misguided) to dictate what\nsubstantive reasons one has. Whether a theory that operates only with\nrequirements of substantive rationality can do this is still a\ncontroversial question.\n\nThus, despite the now-voluminous literature on structural rationality,\nthere remain deep challenges for all the views that have been\nidentified. How one adjudicates the comparative seriousness of these\nchallenges will affect whether one opts for a theory of rationality\nthat includes normative structural requirements, non-normative\nstructural requirements, or no structural requirements at all.\n",
