    "main_text": "Criticisms || The Threat of Skepticism\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nMany honestly claim that they are not sure what acquaintance is. If\nasked what reason they have for thinking that there is such a thing as\nacquaintance, some acquaintance theorists would reply that they are\nacquainted with their being acquainted with things, or directly aware\nof their being directly aware (Russell 1912: Ch. 5; Fumerton 1995:\n77). Moser provides a useful analogy:\n\n\nCompare the parallel situation where one is so absorbed in what is\nhappening on the movie screen that one is completely unaware of\none\u2019s watching a movie. (1989: 78)\n\n\nBecoming aware of one\u2019s watching a movie is analogous to\nbecoming acquainted with one\u2019s being acquainted with pain, or\nbecoming acquainted with one\u2019s being acquainted with a shade of\nred. However, if the analogy is apt, the opponent might see it as a\nreason to doubt that the acquaintance relation is really there, for\nonce we reflect on whether we are watching a movie it is almost always\neasy to determine whether we are, but the opponent has no easy time\nfinding any such relation as acquaintance or direct awareness. Of\ncourse, the movie analogy is just that\u2014an analogy. As already\ndiscussed in\n section 2,\n from the acquaintance theorist\u2019s perspective, such analogies\nand metaphors are bound to be misleading in some respects. It might be\nmore fruitful to direct one\u2019s attention to it by describing it\nin some (hopefully) revealing way, as we did in\n section 2:\n acquaintance is that relation the subject had to pain before being\nengrossed in the conversation, the relation that ceased during the\nconversation, and that began again shortly thereafter. \n\nMany do find it intuitive and prima facie plausible that they\nare acquainted with or directly aware of at least experiential states\nand their features, and that this direct awareness is a fundamental\nsource of knowledge. Still, some will claim not to find such a\nrelation. It\u2019s not clear how damaging this is to the proponents\nof acquaintance. The fact that doubts and disagreements can arise\nregarding acquaintance or the given should not be too puzzling since\nnot everything about the nature of the given is itself given, and, as\nDescartes observed long ago, one can easily raise doubts regarding\nwhat one can see most clearly and distinctly, at least while one is\nnot attending directly to the appropriate ground or insight. To be\nclear, this is not to say that those who doubt the existence of\nacquaintance must not be trying to attend to it, or even that they are\nsomehow unable to find it; it would be more appropriate to say that\nthey don\u2019t realize that it is acquaintance that they have found,\nor that this realization is fleeting, unstable, or easy to dismiss as\nmerely apparent. Some opponents may actually accept that something\nlike acquaintance exists but doubt that it can provide much, if any,\njustification for our beliefs; in denying that they have found\nanything like acquaintance, it may be that they mean only to deny that\nthey have found a relation of acquaintance that can make a\nsignificant difference to the epistemic justification of our\nbeliefs. \n\nBut what of those who deny that they ever find anything like a\nrelation of acquaintance when they introspect or go looking for it?\nShouldn\u2019t such denials raise serious doubts regarding\nacquaintance? To determine the impact of such denials on the\nacquaintance theory, it will help to reflect more carefully on how we\nshould understand them. If we understand the opponents as claiming\nthat they are not directly aware of being directly aware of anything,\nor that they are not acquainted with being acquainted with anything,\nthen they would be presupposing the existence of that which they claim\nnot to find. It seems that we ought, instead, to take them as claiming\nthat they simply do not understand what acquaintance is, or what the\nacquaintance theorist means by \u2018acquaintance,\u2019 even after\nattempting to follow the acquaintance theorist\u2019s attempts to\nlead us to grasp or understand it. Dialectically, there seems to be no\nway for the acquaintance theorist to reject this opposing position\nwithout begging the question. However, this does not show that the\nacquaintance theory is false or unjustified. Objections to the very\nintelligibility of critical philosophical concepts (concepts of self,\nuniversals, causation, free will, matter, etc.) are hardly rare in\nphilosophy, and philosophers do not abandon their positions in the\nface of such disagreements. The fact of disagreement between\nphilosophers on fundamental matters may lead to difficulties.\nDisagreement between those who seem to be our intellectual peers or\nequals may suggest that we should lower our confidence in our own\nviews, perhaps even drastically lower our confidence. But these are\nnot difficulties that only the acquaintance theory confronts. So, to\nthe extent that there is an objection or problem with the fact that\nsome deny that there is such a thing as acquaintance, a similar\nproblem seems to afflict most any other philosophical theory. \n\nThe acquaintance theorists are aware that their claim to being\nacquainted with acquaintance is unlikely to be of much help to those\nwho claim not to understand what acquaintance is, and may point out\nthat there are other, dialectical considerations in favor of their\nview (see Fumerton 1995: 77; Chalmers 2010: 287; and Taylor 2015). We\nend by summarizing a number of such considerations. While these\nconsiderations are controversial, they suggest that acquaintance\ntheories deserve more serious attention than they have recently\nreceived. Most of these have already been covered above. First,\nacquaintance theorists have defended sophisticated accounts of\nnoninferentially justified belief, and offered responses to classical\narguments against the possibility of such beliefs, like the Sellarsian\ndilemma. Second, a view that accepts the possibility of acquaintance\nwith universals seems able to explain not only how knowledge is\npossible, but also how thought itself is possible, and how a thought\ncan be about something else. Third, the acquaintance theorist\nwho accepts acquaintance with complex universals is in a position to\nprovide an account of our knowledge of necessary truths. Fourth, those\nwho accept acquaintance with logical or probability relations between\npropositions can give a unified treatment of foundational and\nnonfoundational knowledge\u2014a unified treatment of knowledge by\nacquaintance and knowledge by description\u2014and are not as\nvulnerable to the threat of skepticism. Fifth, the sophisticated\nacquaintance theory seems to accommodate two constraints on epistemic\njustification that many find intuitive (though not everyone accepts;\nmany accounts end up rejecting one or the other): justification is\ntruth-conducive, since it requires acquaintance with facts\nthat make true (or at least make probable) our beliefs; and\njustification is internal in the sense that the subject has a\nsecure perspective on the truth, or possesses a kind of assurance of\nthe truth (or probability) via acquaintance with truth-making and\nprobability-making relations.\n\nOpponents of the theory may seek acquaintance with such relations or\nentities without finding it, or at least, without realizing that it is\nacquaintance that they have found. While acquaintance theorists are\nlikely to take phenomenological considerations seriously, they may\nplausibly argue, first, that it is far from obvious that we are\nnot acquainted with such entities as those just mentioned\n(indeed, many have found it difficult to deny that we can sometimes,\nin very simple cases at least, just \u201csee\u201d the entailment\nrelation between propositions), and second, that the fact that other\nphilosophers disagree about this does not raise a problem specific to\nthe acquaintance theory. Moreover, the significant theoretical\nadvantages gained may more than compensate for any lack of\nphenomenological obviousness. \n\nTo summarize: Russell\u2019s distinction between knowledge by\nacquaintance and knowledge by description is arguably best understood\nas a distinction between foundational knowledge of truths acquired by\nacquaintance and nonfoundational knowledge of truths that depend,\nultimately, on foundational knowledge. Acquaintance is a direct,\nnonjudgmental and nonconceptual form of awareness that he took to be\ncrucial for both forms of knowledge. Following Russell, some appeal to\nacquaintance with particular facts to account for the possibility of\nfoundational empirical knowledge; some appeal to acquaintance with\nuniversals to account for the possibility of thought itself; some\nappeal to acquaintance with complex universals to account of the\npossibility of foundational a priori knowledge; and some\nappeal to acquaintance with logical and probabilistic relations to\naccount for the possibility of nonfoundational knowledge or\n\u201cknowledge by description.\u201d Thus, for Russell and many\nother acquaintance theorists, even \u201cknowledge by\ndescription\u201d depends on acquaintance, and in more than one way.\nRecently, more sophisticated forms of the acquaintance theory have\nbeen developed, and responses to central objections offered. Moreover,\nsome philosophers of mind have appealed to acquaintance to either\ndefend, or critique, the knowledge argument for dualism. In light of\nall this, one can expect the relation of acquaintance and the\ndistinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by\ndescription to remain at the center of a number of debates in\nepistemology and the philosophy of mind. \n",
