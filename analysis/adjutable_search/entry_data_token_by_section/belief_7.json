    "main_text": "Types, Degrees, and Relatives of Belief || Varieties of Implicit Belief\n2.2 Varieties of Implicit Belief\n2.2.1. Belief Without Explicit Representation\n\nIt seems natural to say that you believe that the number of planets is\nless than 9, and also that the number of planets is less than 10, and\nalso that the number of planets is less than 11, and so on, for any\nnumber greater than 8 that one cares to name. On a simplistic reading\nof the representational approach, this presents a difficulty. If each\nbelief is stored individually in representational format somewhere in\nthe mind, it would seem that we must have a huge number of stored\nrepresentations relevant to the number of planets\u2014more than it\nseems plausible or necessary to attribute to an ordinary human being.\nAnd of course this problem generalizes easily.\n\nThe advocate of the maps view of representational structure (see\n\u00a71.1.1, above) can, perhaps, avoid this difficulty entirely,\nsince it seems a map of the solar system does represent all\nthese facts about the number of planets within a simple, tractable\nsystem. However, representationalists have more commonly responded to\nthis issue by drawing a distinction between explicit and implicit\nbelief. One believes P explicitly if a\nrepresentation with that content is actually present in the mind in\nthe right sort of way\u2014for example, if a sentence with that\ncontent is inscribed in the \u201cbelief box\u201d (see \u00a71.1\nabove). One believes P implicitly (or\ntacitly) if one believes P, but the mind does not\npossess, in a belief-like way, a representation with that content.\n(Philosophers sometimes use the term dispositional to refer\nto beliefs that are implicit in the present sense\u2014but this\ninvites confusion with the occurrent-dispositional distinction\ndiscussed above (\u00a72.1). Implicit beliefs are, perhaps,\nnecessarily dispositional in the sense of the previous subsection, if\noccurrently deploying a belief requires explicitly tokening a\nrepresentation of it; but explicit beliefs may plausibly be\ndispositional or occurrent.)\n\nPerhaps all that\u2019s required to implicitly believe something is\nthat the relevant content be swiftly derivable from something one\nexplicitly believes (Dennett 1978, 1987). Thus, in the planets case,\nwe may say that you believe explicitly that the number of planets is 8\nand only implicitly that the number of planets is less than 9, less\nthan 10, etc. Of course, if swift derivability is the criterion, then\nalthough there may be a sharp line between explicit and implicit\nbeliefs (depending on whether the representation is stored or not),\nthere will not be a sharp line between what one believes implicitly\nand what, though derivable from one\u2019s beliefs, one does not\nactually believe, since swiftness is a matter of degree (see Field\n1978; Lycan 1986).\n\nThe representationalist may also grant the possibility of implicit\nbelief, or belief without explicit representation, in cases of the\nfollowing sort (discussed in Dennett 1978; Fodor 1987). A\nchess-playing computer is explicitly programmed with a large number of\nspecific strategies, in consequence of which it almost always ends up\ntrying to get its queen out early; but nowhere is there any explicitly\nprogrammed representation with the content \u201cget the queen out\nearly\u201d, or any explicitly programmed representation from which\n\u201cget the queen out early\u201d is swiftly derivable. The\npattern emerges as a product of various features of the hardware and\nsoftware, despite its not being explicitly encoded. While most\nphilosophers would not want to say that any currently existing\nchess-playing computer literally has the belief that it should get its\nqueen out early, it is clear that an analogous possibility could arise\nin the human case and thus threaten representationalism, unless\nrepresentationalism makes room for a kind of emergent, implicit belief\nthat arises from more basic structural facts in this way. However, if\nthe representationalist grants the presence of belief\nwhenever there is a belief-like pattern of actual or\npotential behavior, regardless of underlying representational\nstructure, then the position risks collapsing into dispositionalism or\ninterpretationism. The issue of how to account for apparent cases of\nbelief without explicit representation poses an underexplored\nchallenge to representationalism (see Schwitzgebel forthcoming).\n2.2.2. Belief Without Conscious Endorsement\n\nEmpirical psychologists have drawn a contrast between implicit and\nexplicit memory or knowledge, but this distinction does not map neatly\nonto the implicit/explicit belief distinction described in Section\n2.2.1. In the psychologists\u2019 sense, explicit memory involves the\nconscious recollection of previously presented information, while\nimplicit memory involves the facilitation of a task or a change in\nperformance as a result of previous exposure to information, without,\nor at least not as a result of, conscious recollection (Schacter 1987;\nSchacter and Tulving 1994; though see Squire 2004). For example, if a\nsubject is asked to memorize a list of word pairs\u2014bird/truck,\nstove/desk, etc.\u2014and is then cued with one word and asked to\nprovide the other, the subject\u2019s explicit memory is being\ntested. If the subject is brought back two weeks later, and has no\nconscious recollection of most of the word pairs on the list, then\nthey have no explicit memory of them. However, implicit memory of the\nword-pairs would be revealed if they found it easier to learn the\n\u201cforgotten\u201d pairs a second time. Knowledge that is\n\u201cimplicit\u201d in this sense will normally not be\nimplicit in the sense of the previous subsection (if it were swiftly\nderivable from what one explicitly believes, presumably one could\nanswer the test questions correctly); it\u2019s also at least\nconceptually possible that some such psychologically implicit\nknowledge may be stored stored \u201cexplicitly\u201d in the sense\nof the previous subsection.\n\nA different empirical literature addresses the issue of\n\u201cimplicit attitudes\u201d, for example implicit racism or\nsexism, which are often held to conflict with verbally or consciously\nespoused attitudes. Such implicit attitudes might be revealed by\nemotional reactions (e.g., more negative affect among White\nparticipants when assigned to a co-operative task with a Black person\nthan with a White person) or by association or priming tasks (e.g.,\nfaster categorization responses when White participants are asked to\npair negative words with dark-skinned faces and positive words with\nlight-skinned faces than vice versa). However, it remains\ncontroversial to what extent tests of this sort reveal subjects\u2019\n(implicit) beliefs, as opposed to merely culturally-given\nassociations or attitudes other than full-blown belief (Wilson,\nLindsey, and Schooler 2000; Kihlstrom 2004; Lane et al. 2007; Hunter\n2011; Tumulty 2014; Levy 2015; Machery 2016; Madva 2016; Zimmerman\n2018; Brownstein, Madva, and Gawronski 2019). Gendler, for example,\nsuggests that we regard such implicit attitudes as arational and\nautomatic aliefs rather than genuine evidence-responsive\nbeliefs (Gendler 2008a\u2013b; for critique see Schwitzgebel\n2010; Mandelbaum 2013).\n",
