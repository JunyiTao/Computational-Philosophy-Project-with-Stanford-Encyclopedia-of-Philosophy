Introduction\n1.1 What are jury theorems?\n\nHow many individuals should be entrusted with a given decision?\nEpistemically speaking, what matters is how the correctness or quality\nof decisions depends on the number of participants, for instance, how\nthe correctness of jury verdicts (\u201cinnocent\u201d or\n\u201cguilty\u201d) depends on jury size, how the quality of\nparliamentary decisions depends on parliament size, how the quality of\nelection outcomes depends on the size of the electorate, or how the\nquality of expert advice depends on the size of the advisory body.\nJury theorems address this problem. Their perspective is epistemic\nrather than procedural: the sole aim is to reach \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201ccorrect\u201d decisions by an external standard rather than to\nrespect individual participation rights or ensure democratically\nlegitimate decisions. The reliance on correctness facts is the central\nphilosophical commitment of jury theorems (see\n Section 4.1).\n\nThis entry refers to the set of individuals participating in the\ndecision as the group or (decision) body, and to the\nlarger set from which this group is selected as the\npopulation. Examples are electoral bodies selected from the\npopulation of citizens, and scientific advisory bodies selected from\nthe population of scientists. In real life, some decision bodies are\nvery large: electoral bodies often contain millions of citizens. Other\nbodies have medium size: juries in court often involve 12 members. Yet\nother bodies have few or just one member: authoritarian states are\nruled by small cliques or just one person.\n\nJury theorems are mathematical theorems of the following general\nstructure:\n\nGeneric Jury Theorem: Given a choice problem of type\nX, a voting procedure of type Y, and premises about\nindividuals Z, the epistemic performance of group decisions\ndepends on group size in ways W.\n\nThis schematic statement contains several parameters, filled in\ndifferently by different jury theorems. The first and simplest jury\ntheorem goes back to French enlightenment philosopher and\nmathematician Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de\nCondorcet. In Condorcet\u2019s (1785) theorem,\n\nthe choice problem is binary, like the guilty-or-innocent problem\nof juries;\nthe voting procedure is majority voting;\nthe premises on individuals are competence and independence\nassumptions of particularly simple kinds;\nthe conclusion is that \u201ccrowds are wise\u201d in the\ntwofold sense that the probability of a correct group decision (i)\nincreases in group size and (ii) converges to one as group size\napproaches infinity.\n\n\nThese two Condorcetian \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d conclusions have\nconsiderably shaped the field, because they reappear (partly or fully)\nin many other jury theorems, whilst being controversial. The research\nprogramme of the jury theorem literature is partly an attempt to place\none or both Condorcetian conclusions on improved premises, and partly\nan attempt to derive jury theorems reaching rival conclusions, such as\nthe optimality of some finite and possibly small group size (against\nCondorcet\u2019s first conclusion) or the fallibility of\nasymptotically large bodies (against Condorcet\u2019s second\nconclusion).\n\nTaken in themselves, the Condorcetian conclusions represent two\ncontroversial wisdom-of-crowds hypotheses, which can be stated more\ngenerally (Dietrich & Spiekermann 2020):\n\nThe Increasing-Reliability Hypothesis: Larger bodies\nare better truth-trackers. They make epistemically better decisions\nthan smaller bodies or single individuals.\n\nThe Infallibility Hypothesis: Huge bodies are\ninfallible truth-trackers. They make epistemically optimal decisions\nin the limit as group size tends to infinity.\n\nUpon deeper analysis, the infallibility hypothesis is untenable, and\ncannot even serve as an approximation, idealisation or paradigm of how\nlarge-scale democracy performs (see\n Section 2).\n The fact that many jury theorems reach this over-optimistic\nconclusion has not always been helpful, by threatening the credibility\nof the jury theorem literature as a whole. The right response is to\nrevise the premises of jury theorems such that they become justifiable\nand imply plausible conclusions, like increasing reliability. Jury\ntheorems with more plausible premises and conclusions are indeed\nachievable (see\n Section 2).\n\nThe increasing-reliability hypothesis thus appears to be the more\nappropriate rendition of the wisdom of crowds. The infallibility\nhypothesis should arguably give way, as will emerge in\n Section 2\n and\n Section 4.2\n (see\n Section 4.3\n for a potential exception). Jury theorems reaching the infallibility\nconclusion can be mathematically interesting; philosophically, they\nmight be seen as arguments against their own premises.\n1.2 A broad notion of decision\n\nJury theorems address collective \u201cdecisions\u201d in a broad\nsense. Decisions could, for instance, stand for collective\nbeliefs or collective actions or choices. In the\nlegal arena, jury verdicts represent beliefs (about guilt or\ninnocence), whereas court rulings represent actions (of convicting or\nacquitting defendants). In the political arena, parliamentary\ndecisions and referendum decisions usually represent choices.\nDepending on its mandate, an ethical or scientific commission either\nproduces collective beliefs (which serve as advice), or performs\nactions, e.g., sets a budget or institutes ethical standards.\n\nBut there is one key condition: decisions must be\ncorrectness-apt, i.e., be either factually correct or\nincorrect (or, more generally, of some correctness degree). Which\nfacts determine correctness? Belief-type decisions are correct if the\nbelief has true content. Action-type decisions are correct depending\non some state; e.g., court rulings are correct depending on past\nactions of the defendant.\n\nCollective beliefs are examples of collective attitudes.\nOther possible collective attitudes are collective values, desires,\npreferences, or intentions. They too can be formed through\naggregation: think of preference aggregation rules generating\ncollective preferences. Any collective attitude whose possession can\nbe factually correct or incorrect is potentially an object of jury\ntheorems. Whether attitudes can be correct is, of course, more\ncontroversial for non-belief attitudes (cf.\n Section 4.1).\n\nIn sum, jury theorems address collective decisions of any\ncorrectness-apt kind, including collective actions, beliefs, and other\nattitudes.\n2. Three Jury Theorems\n\nThis section states and discusses three jury theorems about majority\ndecisions between two alternatives. They assume a population of\nindividuals, labelled \\(1, 2, \\ldots,\\) representing the possible\nmembers of the decision-making group. The population might contain,\nfor example, all citizens of a state (for a political decision) or all\nscientists (for a scientific decision). It is infinite\u2014an\nidealisation needed for considering arbitrarily large decision bodies.\nThe group has any finite size \\(n\\geq1\\) and consists of the first\n\\(n\\) individuals \\(1, 2, \\ldots, n.\\) Each member votes for one\nalternative. The alternative receiving a majority wins (if \\(n\\) is\neven, there can be a tie without collective decision). Following the\nepistemic approach, one alternative is correct (right,\nbetter, etc.) and the other is incorrect (wrong, worse,\netc.), independently of the decision process. This makes any\nindividual judgment and any group decision correct or incorrect.\n\nJury theorems operate in a probabilistic framework: anything unknown\nis modelled as a random event or variable (defined relative to some\nbackground probability\n space[1]).\n\nNotation: For any jury theorem of the entry, the probability\nfunction (of the underlying probability space) is denoted \\(P\\). Where\nneeded by a jury theorem, the event that individual \\(i (=1, 2,\n\\ldots)\\) is correct is denoted \\(R_{i}\\), and for each possible group\nsize \\(n\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) the event that a majority is correct\n(i.e., that more than half of \\(R_{1},\\ldots,R_{n}\\) hold) is denoted\n \\(\\Maj_{n}\\).[2]\n2.1 Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem\n\nCondorcet\u2019s (1785) jury theorem will be discussed first on\ngrounds of simplicity and historic importance, setting aside concerns\nabout its premises and conclusions. Condorcet\u2019s text does not\nfollow modern mathematics, but many later authors have stated his\ntheorem formally (e.g., Grofman 1975; Grofman, Owen, & Feld\n 1983).[3]\n The theorem operates in a simple formal framework, with only the\nfollowing ingredients:\n\nPrimitives of Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem: correctness\nevents \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots,\\) defined relative to a probability\nspace.\n\nIn these primitives (and those of the two other jury theorems in this\nsection), the correctness events could be replaced by more basic\nprimitives, namely the following random variables: votes (judgments)\nof the individuals \\(1, 2, \\ldots,\\) whose values are alternatives,\nand a \u201cstate\u201d variable, whose value is, or more generally\ndetermines, the correct alternative. Each correctness event \\(R_{i}\\)\nis then defined as the event that \\(i\\)\u2019s vote equals the\ncorrect alternative, and the whole analysis stays unchanged. For\ninstance, in a court\u2019s decision problem, the votes of judges\ncould take values in \\(\\{\\text{convict},\\text{acquit}\\}\\) and the\nstate could take values in \\(\\{\\text{guilty},\\text{innocent}\\}\\),\nwhere \\(\\text{convict}\\) is correct if the state is \\(guilty\\), and\n\\(\\text{acquit}\\) is correct if the state is \\(innocent\\).\nEquivalently, and more parsimoniously, votes and state could all take\nvalues in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\), where \\(R_{i}\\) is the event that \\(i\\)\u2019s\nvote equals the\n state.[4]\n\nCondorcet\u2019s theorem assumes that correctness is independent\nacross individuals and has (the same) probability greater\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) for each individual. Formally:\n\nUnconditional Independence (UI). The individual\ncorrectness events \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) are (unconditionally)\nindependent.\n\nUnconditional Competence (UC). The (unconditional)\nindividual correctness probability \\(P(R_{i})\\)\u2014the general\ncompetence\u2014exceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and is the same for all\nindividuals \\(i\\).\n\nCondorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem: Assuming UI and UC,\nthe probability of majority correctness, \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\), increases in\n (odd[5])\n group size \\(n\\) and converges to 1.\n\nThis theorem paints an optimistic picture of the wisdom of crowds, by\nconcluding that majority outcomes are not only increasingly reliable\nas voters are added, but also infallible in the limit.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The probability of majority\ncorrectness for different group sizes and competence levels. [An\n extended description of Figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 1\n illustrates increasing majority reliability, for different levels of\nindividual competence \\(p=P(R_{i})\\). Note the fast convergence to\none, even for just slightly competent individuals.\n\nWhy does this theorem hold? Intuitively, UI and UC imply that the\nindividual judgments behave like independent tosses of the same coin\nbiased towards the truth. The more often the coin is tossed, the more\nlikely the majority of the tosses are \u201ccorrect\u201d, and this\nlikelihood converges to one.\n\nTechnically, the increasing-reliability conclusion follows via a\nnon-trivial combinatorial argument. The infallibility conclusion has\nan easy proof, which can be sketched here. By UC, general competence\n\\(p=P(R_{i})\\) is voter-independent. The group\u2019s proportion of\ncorrect votes is a random variable that converges stochastically to\n\\(p\\) by the law of large numbers, using UI. So, as\n\\(p>\\frac{1}{2}\\) by UC, the probability that this proportion\nexceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which is precisely \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\), converges\nto 1 as \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\).\n\nAlthough \u201cincreases\u201d should be read as \u201cweakly\nincreases\u201d in Condorcet\u2019s and the other two jury theorems,\nthe stronger conclusion of strictly increasing \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\) holds\nin all non-degenerate cases of these\n theorems.[6]\n2.2 The problem of common causes of votes\n\nA tempting mistake is to believe that votes are probabilistically\nindependent as soon as they are causally independent, i.e.,\ndo not affect one another. Votes are often causally independent:\nsecret voting prevents someone\u2019s vote from influencing someone\nelse\u2019s vote. Sometimes not only the votes (or voting acts), but\neven the individuals more broadly (their reasonings, perspectives,\nknowledge, votes, etc.) are causally independent. This happens if\nindividuals do not deliberate or otherwise interact\u2014a rare, but\npossible scenario. Deliberation immediately creates causal dependence\nbetween individuals, but not between their (secret) votes.\n\nCausal independence (between votes or even individuals) by no means\nmakes votes probabilistically independent, since common\ncauses create correlations. This fact will be obvious to empirical\nscientists, statisticians, or causal-network theorists; see, for\ninstance, the entry on\n Reichenbach\u2019s common cause principle,\n as well as Reichenbach (1956), Pearl (2000) and Dietrich and List\n(2004) on common causes in jury theorems. Common causes of votes are\nfactors influencing two or more votes. They exist in abundance. Voters\nare usually exposed to\n\nshared evidence, such as witness reports;\nshared perspective-shaping influences, coming from a shared\nlanguage, shared concepts, a shared methodology, or shared\nhypotheses;\nshared contextual influences that are unrelated to the decision\ntask yet affect judgment skills, such as noise or heat.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the resulting correlations between votes\u2014and\nultimately between correctness events \\(R_{1},R_{2},\\ldots\\)\u2014are\nusually positive, which undermines diversity and reinforces tendencies\nand errors. Positive correlation between correctness events means:\ngiven that someone votes correctly, others are more likely to\nvote correctly. Why is the correlation positive? A correct judgment\nby, say, individual 1 (the event \\(R_{1}\\)) raises the probability\nthat the common causes take a truth-conducive form (i.e., that\nevidence is non-misleading, contextual influences support judgmental\nskills, etc.), which in turn raises the probability that other\nindividuals are correct (the events \\(R_{2},R_{3},\\ldots\\)).\nConversely, an error by individual 1 raises the probability of\nmisleading common causes, which raises the probability of errors by\nothers.\n\nIn sum, voting and correctness are interpersonally (positively)\ncorrelated through common causes, against Condorcet\u2019s\nindependence assumption.\n2.3 Partial solution: the Conditional Jury Theorem\n\nDependencies between votes can be \u201cconditionalised away\u201d.\nGiven the common causes\u2014the shared evidence,\netc.\u2014votes no longer exhibit dependence, as they no longer carry\nnew information about common causes, hence about one another.\nConditionalisation blocks the information flow through common causes.\nThese considerations apply a well-known principle: causally\nindependent phenomena are probabilistically independent conditional on\ntheir common causes (Reichenbach 1956).\n\nThe conditionalisation strategy assumes that votes do not influence\none another, i.e., are causally independent, as in secret\nvoting. Otherwise information can flow between votes\ndirectly, not just via common causes, and conditionalising on\ncommon causes fails to make votes probabilistically independent.\n\nTo implement conditionalisation, introduce a random variable\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\), called the facts, on which to conditionalise.\nOne could interpret the facts as the totality of common causes, but\nsimpler interpretations are also possible. The facts could be some\nproxy of common causes. Most commonly, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is the fact\ndetermining the correct alternative. This correct-making fact is\nstandardly called the state (of the world). In a\ncourt\u2019s convict-or-acquit decision, its possible values could be\n\u201cguilty\u201d and \u201cinnocent\u201d, which make\n\u201cconvict\u201d or \u201cinnocent\u201d correct, respectively.\n Section 2.1,\n Section 4.1 and\n Section 5.1\n discuss the state.\n\nThe new jury theorem will therefore rest on the following\nprimitives.\n\nPrimitives of the Conditional Jury Theorem: correctness\nevents \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) and an arbitrary random variable\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (the facts variable, representing for instance\nthe state or the common causes), all defined relative to a probability\nspace.\n\nConvention: Definitions involving \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) will assume\nthat each value of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) has positive probability (which\nfacilitates conditionalising, but restricts attention to discrete\nrather than continuous \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)). All definitions could be\n generalised.[7]\n\nThese are the revised premises and theorem.\n\nConditional Independence (CI). The individual\ncorrectness events \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) are independent given\nany value \\(x\\) of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\n\nConditional Competence (CC). For any value \\(x\\) of\nthe facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), the conditional correctness probability\n\\(P(R_{i}|x)\\)\u2014the specific competence on\n\\(x\\)\u2014exceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and is the same for all\nindividuals \\(i\\).\n\nConditional Jury Theorem: Assuming CI and CC, the\nprobability of majority correctness, \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\), increases in\n (odd[8])\n group size \\(n\\) and converges to 1.\n\nThis theorem reaches the same optimistic conclusions as\nCondorcet\u2019s theorem, but based on new premises. The new\nindependence assumption is more plausible to the extent that the facts\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) include common causes or proxies thereof. If the facts\nare the state of the world\u2014a very rough proxy of common\ncauses\u2014one obtains the literature\u2019s most common form of\nconditionalisation and the classical State-Conditional Jury\nTheorem (e.g., Austen-Smith & Banks 1996). The Conditional Jury\nTheorem generalises this familiar jury theorem to an arbitrary target\nof conditionalisation \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Replacing\nstate-conditionalisation by arbitrary conditionalisation makes the\njury theorem more flexible, opening the door to genuinely plausible\nindependence assumptions.\n\nHow has the competence assumption evolved? Conditional Competence is\nlogically stronger than Unconditional Competence: individuals must\noutperform fair coins not just globally, but given any facts. For\ninstance, in a court\u2019s decision to convict or acquit, where the\nfacts are the state of guilt or innocence, each individual (judge)\nmust be more likely correct than incorrect given guilt and also given\ninnocence.\n\nAn individual \\(i\\)\u2019s general competence is expressible as his\n(probability-weighted) average specific competence across possible\nfacts, i.e., possible values \\(x\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\):\n\n\n\\[\\tag{1} P(R_{i})=\\sum_{x}P(R_{i}|x)P(x). \\]\n\n\n\nThis shows that CC implies UC.\n\nUnfortunately, the Conditional Jury Theorem maintains the unrealistic\nconclusion of asymptotic infallibility. Conditionalisation on facts\ncan repair the independence premise, but another problem in the\npremises remains, as will now be explained.\n2.4 The fundamental tension between independence and competence\n\nOne might have hoped that the \u201cconditional\u201d premises CI\nand CC are jointly justified for at least some\nconditionalisation, i.e., some suitably designed facts\nvariable \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Then the Conditional Jury Theorem would rest\non justified premises, and we could trust its conclusions. But a\ndilemma arises:\n\nConditional Independence is only plausible if one packs many facts\ninto \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (ideally all common causes).\nConditional Competence is only plausible if one packs few facts\ninto \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (ideally no facts, so that CC reduces to\nUC, the maximally plausible instance of CC).\n\n\nTherefore, CI and CC require different conditionalisations. They are\nalmost never justified jointly, but only justified\nindividually, for different facts variables \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)\n(Dietrich 2008). This is the fundamental tension between independence\nand competence. This tension lies not in a logical contradiction\nbetween both, but in the nature of realistic decision problems (for a\npotential exception, see\n Section 4.3).\n\nWhy does this tension exist? Formal theorizing aside, it is obvious\nthat whether someone is competent\u2014i.e., more often right than\nwrong\u2014depends on the type (reference class) of judgment tasks\nconsidered. Plausibly, people are more often right among all\nconceivable judgment tasks (the maximal reference class), and\npresumably also among many large reference classes, such as all\nguilty-or-innocent judgment tasks. But someone is presumably\nincompetent\u2014more often wrong\u2014among some very specific\ntypes of judgment tasks, such as all confusing tasks, and all\nguilty-or-innocent judgment tasks with seemingly honest but lying\nwitnesses.\n\nEach instance \\(x\\) of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) defines a type\n(reference class) of tasks: those tasks in which the facts are \\(x\\).\nSome instances of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) make it easy to form\ncorrect judgments: instances \\(x\\) where the evidence is transparent,\nwitnesses are honest, laboratory tests are correct, etc. Here\nindividuals \\(i\\) are competent: \\(P(R_{i}|x)>\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nPerhaps some other instances of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) make it hard\nto form correct judgments: instances \\(x\\) with misleading evidence,\netc. Here voters are not competent: \\(P(R_{i}|x)\\leq\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nWhether misleading instances exist\u2014i.e., whether CC\nfails\u2014depends on the facts variable \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) used. If all\ncommon causes are packed into \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (presumably to ensure\nConditional Independence CI), then almost inevitably certain instances\n\\(x\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) represent misleading circumstances, in which\nvoters \\(i\\) have low competence \\(P(R_{i}|x)<\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nIronically, if one packs much less information into the facts\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\), possibly even reducing \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to the state\n(often a variable with just two instances), then one may well\nrehabilitate Conditional Competence, whilst sacrificing Conditional\nIndependence. This is the dilemma.\n2.5 The Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem\n\nThe dilemma can be escaped with a jury theorem with more plausible\npremises and conclusions. Think of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) as being\nrich enough to justify Conditional Independence; so \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)\ncontains the common causes, or a good enough proxy or substitute for\nthem.\n\nAlthough voters will be incompetent under some (unfortunate) instances\n\\(x\\) of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), they will plausibly be competent\nmost of the time, i.e., under most facts instances. This suggests\nreplacing Conditional Competence with the weaker premise of\nTendency to Competence. What is this axiom? It says that\ncompetence is more often high than low. More precisely, competence\nexceeds 0.5 by some amount at least as often as it falls below 0.5 by\nthis amount, for any positive amount. So, competence is 0.51 at least\nas often as 0.49; it is 0.55 at least as often as 0.45; etc. Formally,\nan individual \\(i\\)\u2019s specific competence\n\\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\) depends on the (random) facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\),\nhence is itself random. If its value exceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the\nfacts can be called truth-conducive or easy for\n\\(i\\); if its value is below \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the facts can be called\nmisleading or difficult for \\(i\\); if its value is\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the facts can be called neutral for \\(i\\),\nas they do not push in any direction. A discrete random number (such\nas specific competence \\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\)) tends to\nexceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) if, for each \\(\\epsilon>0\\), it equals\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon\\) at least as likely as\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. A competence distribution that\ntends to exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}.\\)\n\n[An\n extended description of Figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 2\n gives an example where specific competence (with values \\(0,\n\\frac{1}{8},\\) \\(\\frac{1}{4},\\) \\(\\frac{3}{8}, \\ldots, 1)\\) tends to\nexceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\): competence is \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) with higher\nprobably than \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\); it is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) with higher\nprobably than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\); etc. Visually, this makes the\ndistribution lean to the right.\n\nThis leads to the following jury theorem (Dietrich & Spiekermann\n2013a).\n\nPrimitives of the Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem: same as\nfor the Conditional Jury Theorem.\n\nTendency to Competence (TC): The conditional\ncorrectness probability \\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\)\u2014the specific\ncompetence\u2014tends to exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and is the same\nfor all individuals \\(i\\).\n\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem: Assuming CI and\nTC, the probability of majority correctness, \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\),\nincreases in\n (odd[9])\n group size \\(n\\) and converges to a value which is below 1 unless CC\nholds.\n\nWhat is the limit of majority correctness under CI and TC? It is the\nprobability that the facts (e.g., the shared evidence) are\ntruth-conducive plus half the probability that the facts are\n neutral.[10]\n Loosely speaking, group performance in the limit is as good as the\nfacts. Unsurprisingly, the group cannot beat the facts. It should\nalready count as a success to match the facts asymptotically.\n\nThe twofold evolution from the Conditional Jury Theorem is that the\ncompetence premise is weakened to TC and the infallibility conclusion\nis reversed. Therefore, majorities can be wrong even in asymptotically\nlarge bodies\u2014unless CC holds, i.e., unless voters are\nalways competent. \u201cUnless\u201d can be read strongly\nin the theorem, as meaning \u201cif and only if it is not\nthe case that\u201d.\n2.6 The three jury theorems compared\n\nTable 1 summarizes the three jury theorems.\n\n\nTable 1.

The independence assumption evolves\nfrom unconditional to conditional.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The three competence axioms\nUC, CC and TC. [An\n extended description of Figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 3\n illustrates how the competence assumption evolves:\n\nCondorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem focuses on general\ncompetence, i.e., the fixed probability \\(P(R_{i})\\), which must\nexceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (see Plot a).\nThe Conditional Jury Theorem focuses on specific\ncompetence, i.e., the facts-dependent probability\n\\(P(R_{i}|\\mathbf{x})\\), which must always exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). If\none takes \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to be the state of the world, i.e., considers\nthe State-Conditional Jury Theorem, then (assuming the state\nis binary) only two competence levels are possible, one for each state\n(see Plot b1). Richer facts allow for many possible competence levels\n(see Plot b2).\nThe Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem assumes, less demandingly,\nthat specific competence tends to exceed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (see\nPlot c).\n\n\nMathematically, the Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem generalises the\nConditional Jury Theorem, which generalises Condorcet\u2019s Jury\nTheorem. Why?\n\nThe Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem encompasses the Conditional\nJury Theorem as a special case, the case when CC holds, because in\nthis extreme case (of always competent voters) the theorem\nasserts asymptotic\n infallibility.[11]\nThe Conditional Jury Theorem encompasses Condorcet\u2019s Jury\nTheorem as a special case, obtained when plugging in a trivial facts\nvariable \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) with only one possible value. Here the\npremises CI and CC reduce to Condorcet\u2019s premises UI and UC,\nbecause conditionalising on facts that are certain is like not\nconditionalising at all.\n\n3. Jury Theorems and Diversity\n\nIntuitively, diversity\u2014in backgrounds, perspectives,\ninformation, reasoning modes, skills, etc.\u2014improves collective\nperformance. Where can diversity be found in formal jury frameworks?\nDo the assumptions of jury theorems implicitly rule out diversity, or\ninstead permit or even require diversity?\n3.1 Diversity versus competence heterogeneity\n\nDiversity is describable as plurality in sources and backgrounds:\nindividuals reason differently, hold different perspectives, use\ndifferent information, etc. Although diversity is a multi-dimensional\nand largely informal property, it manifests itself in jury models. As\nwhat? There are two natural candidates: competence heterogeneity and\nindependence. The relation to competence heterogeneity will be\nclarified first\n (Section 3.3\n turns to independence).\n\nDiversity does not imply competence\nheterogeneity\u2014fortunately, as otherwise the three jury theorems\nabove would exclude diversity in the homogeneity clause of their\ncompetence assumptions. Diversity does not imply differences in\ncompetence levels, but differences in competence\nsources. Even under high diversity, members could be correct\nwith identical probabilities\u2014for different reasons.\n\nConversely, competence heterogeneity tends to imply diversity, i.e.,\nnon-diversity tends to imply competence homogeneity, because members\nwith exactly same background, same information, same reasoning, etc.,\nshould be equally competent.\n\nIn sum, competence homogeneity is a systematic feature of non-diverse\ngroups, but not vice versa.\n3.2 Competence heterogeneity threatens the wisdom of crowds\n\nDifferential competence is the main threat to the\nincreasing-reliability hypothesis. The political upshot is that the\nepistemic superiority of democracy is at stake\u2014is it\nepistemically better for a society to be run by a few competent\ncitizens? The wisdom-of-crowds conclusion indeed breaks down in all\nthree theorems if one removes homogeneity from the competence premise.\nLarger bodies can then perform worse, because new members may be\n(much) less competent than existing members. Majority reliability can\neven become a decreasing function of group size, and can\nconverge to a level as low as \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) if competence of new\nmembers converges fast enough to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nFinite optimal group rather than wise crowds? The\nquestion of whether decision bodies should be augmented when new\nmembers are less competent is not far-fetched, but a notorious issue\nin real-life committee design. This is the trade-off: adding less\ncompetent members, on the one hand, lowers average member competence,\nbut, on the other hand, brings the advantage of size, namely that\nerrors of individual members are more easily overruled (\u201cwashed\nout\u201d) by the majority. Depending on which effect is stronger,\nthe probability of majority correctness increases or falls by adding\nless competent members.\n\nWhether some (finite) group is optimal or instead \u201cbigger is\nbetter\u201d has been treated analytically. Answers depend on model\nassumptions (see Karotkin & Paroush 2003).\n\nHow could the wisdom of crowds be rehabilitated? Both wisdom-of-crowds\nhypotheses are discussed in turn.\n\nAsymptotic infallibility despite heterogenous\ncompetence. The asymptotic conclusion of Condorcet\u2019s\nJury Theorem remains true if UC is weakened to the existence of a\nfixed lower bound \\(\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon\\) for everyone\u2019s\ncompetence (Paroush 1998). This assumption can be relaxed further: it\nsuffices that the infinitely many individuals are competent on\naverage, which allows for many incompetent\n individuals[12]\n (see Dietrich 2008; for related or more general results: Boland 1989;\nOwen, Grofman, & Feld 1989; Berend & Paroush 1998).\nUnfortunately, these variants of Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem (and\nanalogous variants of the Conditional Jury Theorem) retain only the\ninfallibility conclusion, sacrificing increasing reliability. The more\nproblematic conclusion has been retained, one might complain.\n\nIncreasing reliability despite heterogenous\ncompetence. There are broadly two approaches to rehabilitate\nthe increasing-reliability hypothesis and thereby defend large-scale\ndemocracy in the face of differential competence.\n\nThe first approach effectively denies that larger bodies have\n\u201cworse\u201d members, by postulating a different procedure to\ndetermine group members: members are selected anonymously, rather than\n(for instance) by competence. Increasing group size no longer means\nkeeping the \u201cold\u201d members and adding \u201cnew\u201d,\noften less competent, members, but it means drawing a fully new\n(larger) group from the\n population.[13]\n This procedure for selecting members differs significantly from that\nwhere the members must be the first \\(n\\) individuals in a predefined\n\u201cpriority order\u201d of the individuals. The new procedure is\nanonymous, instead of effectively prioritising individual 1 over\nindividual 2, individual 2 over individual 3, etc. Which procedure is\nmore realistic is debatable and context-dependent.\n\nA second approach assumes\u2014quite realistically\u2014that\nindividual competence levels are unknown. Even if additional group\nmembers were objectively less competent, this fact would be\ninsufficiently known or established (cf. Romeijn & Atkinson 2011).\nThe institutional designer can consider three kinds of justification\nfor a large, inclusive group. An epistemic justification points out\nthat any proxy used for competence might be misleading. For instance,\nit would seem unjustified to exclude citizens without university\neducation because they might be just as competent or more competent;\nexcluding them might lower collective competence. One procedural\njustification holds that it is unfair to exclude individuals from\ndemocratic decision-making even if their incompetence were established\nbeyond reasonable doubt. Such procedural reasons for inclusion could,\nfor example, be based on the democratic right to equal opportunity for\ninfluence. Another, more nuanced procedural view does not generally\noppose voter exclusion, but requires the incompetence to be\nestablished to a high standard, as those excluded are owed reasons for\nbeing ruled by others.\n\nA version of the last view is defended by Estlund (2008). He grants\nthat some individuals can be more competent than others, thereby\nopening the door to arguments for \u201cepistocracy\u201d (decision\nby small bodies of competent citizens) rather than democracy (decision\nby all or most citizens, directly or indirectly). However, Estlund\nrejects epistocracy on grounds that competence levels cannot be\nidentified beyond reasonable doubt. Individuals excluded from\ndecision-making could rightfully object to being ruled by others\n(Estlund 2008: ch. 11). Estlund\u2019s proposal has led to a lively\ndebate on arguments for and against epistocracy and the role of\nuncertainty about competence (Lippert-Rasmussen 2012; Brennan 2018;\nGoodin & Spiekermann 2018: ch. 15; Gunn 2019).\n\nTo formally tackle limited knowledge about individuals, one could, for\ninstance, introduce subjective probabilities over competence levels,\ni.e., over objective correctness probabilities. More simply, one can\neliminate objective probabilities and competence altogether from the\nmodel and work solely with subjective probabilities over individual\njudgments (rather than over individual competence levels). If\nindividuals are subjectively indistinguishable, judgments can be\nassumed to be interchangeable in de Finetti\u2019s sense of\npermutation-invariance. This implies (with an additional assumption)\nthat larger bodies are more reliable, without becoming asymptotically\ninfallible, by a jury theorem for interchangeable voters\n(Dietrich & Spiekermann 2013a; generalising Ladha 1993). Here,\n\u201creliable\u201d and \u201cinfallible\u201d are no longer\nobjective features of the group, but features of knowledge about\nit.\n\nThis subjectivist approach begs the question of who should hold these\ncredences. But at least it takes the problem of uncertainty about\nindividuals seriously.\n3.3 Diversity as judgmental independence\n\nDiversity manifests itself as probabilistic independence\nbetween individual judgments. If diversity is small\u2014i.e.,\nindividuals reason similarly, use similar evidence, etc.\u2014then\njudgments are highly correlated. Without any diversity, judgments\ncoincide, and the correctness events \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) are\nequivalent. If diversity is high, then judgments correlate less.\nExtreme diversity corresponds to full independence\u2014or even to\nnegative correlation, to mention a rare but interesting possibility\n(Hong & Page 2009; 2012).\n\nCondorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem implicitly presupposes extensive\ndiversity by assuming independence. The Conditional and the\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem are less restrictive: they permit\nmore or less diversity, because their conditional\nindependence assumption is compatible with more or less\nunconditional independence.\n\nMany models of voter dependence have been proposed. A classical model\nintroduces an \u201copinion leader\u201d whose judgment each other\nindividual copies with some probability (Boland, Porschan, & Tong\n1989). Instead of a single opinion leader, the individuals could\ninfluence one another, as captured by pairwise correlations (e.g.,\nLadha 1992). The dependence structure could become yet more complex\nand escape a description in terms of pairwise correlations (Kaniovski\n2010; Pivato 2017).\n\nSome authors focus on the merits of diversity, by presenting theorems\nin which more independence (diversity) leads to better majority\ndecisions (e.g., Berg 1993; Ladha 1995). The mechanism at work is\nthis: more independence makes it more likely that errors of voters are\ncompensated by correctness of other voters. Many authors also present\njury theorems, showing that, despite some dependence or non-diversity,\ncrowds can be \u201cwise\u201d, in the sense of increasing\nreliability (e.g., Berg 1993) or asymptotic infallibility (e.g.,\nPivato 2017). The infallibility conclusion remains objectionable (cf.\n Section 2).\n\nModelling voter dependence in adequate, transparent and tractable ways\nremains a central challenge for future jury theorem research.\n3.4 Diversity affects both decision-making stages: deliberation and aggregation\n\nCollective decision-making can be subdivided into a deliberation\nphase, in which the individuals form or revise their judgments, and an\naggregation phase, in which the post-deliberation judgments are fed\ninto a voting rule which returns the decision (Dryzek & List\n2003). Diversity affects not only the judgment profile in the group at\nany given moment, and hence the aggregation process, but also the\ndeliberation process. Deliberation owes its richness and fruitfulness\nlargely to diversity. Non-diverse bodies gain little from\ndeliberating: their members already reason similarly, take similar\nperspectives, know similar things, etc. In diverse bodies,\ndeliberation can broaden the informational, perspectival, and\nmethodological horizon. The more diversity, the more potential for\njudgment revision through deliberation.\n\nCausal graphs help to understand how diversity affects deliberation.\nThink of the votes (judgments) as embedded in a causal graph. Each\nindividual\u2019s vote is a (probabilistic) causal consequence of\nthis individual\u2019s judgment sources: informational sources,\nintellectual influences, etc. The more the sources differ across\nindividuals, the more diverse the group is. In deliberation, members\nshare their sources. This changes the causal structure: whenever a\nsource is shared with an individual \\(i\\), a causal arrow is added\nfrom that source to \\(i\\)\u2019s vote. This enlarges a voter\u2019s\nspectrum of sources.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Source sharing through\ndeliberation. [An\n extended description of Figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 4\n gives an illustration with just two sources and three individuals.\nSource sharing makes the basis of judgments more similar across\nindividuals, possibly letting judgments converge. Ideal deliberation\nachieves full source sharing, as in Figure 4. The more diverse the\ngroup was initially, the more sources there are to share, hence the\nmore deliberation can \u201cdo\u201d.\n\nWhile deliberation reduces interindividual diversity by removing\nsource asymmetries, it creates intraindividual diversity by widening\nthe spectrum of someone\u2019s sources. Individuals\n\u201cinternalise\u201d diversity when deliberating.\n4. Problems and Questions\n4.1 Do correctness facts exist?\n\nThe controversial philosophical premise of jury theorems is that\nalternatives are factually correct or incorrect (or of some degree of\ncorrectness). The (possibly composite) fact that determines\ncorrectness is called the state of the world or just\n state.[14]\n\nTo disambiguate, notice that formal models often use simplified\nnotions of the state. Firstly, many models reduce the state to its\nunknown part; for instance, the state in a court decision might be\nmodelled as the fact of whether a crime has been committed, treating\nall other determinants of correct verdicts (such as the right\ninterpretation of the law, but also logical or physical facts) as\nknown background facts not worth modelling. Secondly, and more\nradically, many models identify the state with the correct alternative\nitself; they might take the state in a court decision to be\nthe correct verdict (\u201cconvict\u201d or\n\u201cacquit\u201d).\n\nSetting modelling practice aside, which (known or unknown) facts\ndetermine correctness, i.e., constitute the state? One can distinguish\nbetween logical, empirical and normative facts. When a group of\nlogicians votes on whether an argument is valid, correctness depends\non logical facts. When a panel of climate experts predicts the average\nglobal surface temperature in 2100, correctness also depends on\nempirical facts. When a parliament decides on whether to allocate more\nfunding to the health system, correctness depends on normative facts,\nbesides empirical (and logical) facts. In many social decisions,\ncorrectness depends both on unknown empirical facts and unknown\nnormative facts, particularly for decisions on actions or on beliefs\nabout what is valuable or ought to be done.\n\nCritics of jury theorems often question the very notion of\ncorrectness. Some doubt the existence of normative facts necessary for\ncorrectness in political, moral, or other evaluative decisions. This\ncritique is often voiced in the form that there is no\n\u201ctruth\u201d pertaining to decisions in a certain domain (e.g.,\nMuirhead 2014 criticizing Landemore 2013; cf. Gaus 2011 for how\nEstlund 2008 stakes out the domain of truth-apt political claims).\nCertain decisions might indeed be non-epistemic. Judgments of taste,\nfor instance, might express desires, or perhaps beliefs without\ncorrectness fact. For moral judgments, both the existence and the\nnature of correctness facts is controversial.\n\nNote, however, that the existence of moral and other normative facts\ndoes not depend on meta-ethical realism, universalism, or naturalism.\nConstructivism about moral facts, for example, could provide an\nintersubjectively shared social fact that is perfectly suitable for\njury theorems, as long as the construction predates decision-making,\ni.e., occurs previously in the society.\n\nIn sum, all that jury theorems need is the existence of correctness\nfacts of some kind that are process-independent, i.e.,\nindependent of the choice of group (size), the deliberation, and the\naggregation.\n\nIn political settings, the real problem often lies not in non-existent\ncorrectness facts, but in ambiguously defined decision problems. For\nexample, in presidential elections, is the question who best promotes\nthe public good, or who best satisfies the citizens\u2019\npreferences? Ambiguous decision problems lead to ambiguous correctness\nstandards. Jury theorems stay applicable in principle,\nsubject to resolving ambiguities.\n4.2 Are correctness facts underdetermined?\n\nMany group decision problems display what might be called Possible\nUnderdetermination: the true state of the world can (with\nnon-zero probability) be objectively underdetermined by the totality\nof influences on (one or more individuals in) the population, which\nincludes all\n evidence.[15]\n A jury\u2019s choice between \u201cguilty\u201d and\n\u201cinnocent\u201d verdicts normally displays Possible\nUnderdetermination, since the total available evidence can be\nobjectively inconclusive (despite supporting one of these states).\nDietrich and List\u2019s (2004) jury model implicitly assumes\nPossible Underdetermination, because even the ideal interpretation of\ntotal evidence can be incorrect. Landemore (2013: 145) mentions\nsettings in which the correctness of the decision remains objectively\nuncertain, since the truth is never revealed with certainty. This\ncould be interpreted as a strong (\u201cpersisting\u201d) type of\nunderdetermination: the truth is objectively underdetermined not just\nby the influences at the time of decision, but even by all future\ninfluences.\n\nPossible Underdetermination implies that individual judgments, the\ngroup judgment, and even the asymptotic group judgment (as group size\nincreases) are all fallible, i.e., incorrect with non-zero\nprobability. The reason is simple: each of these judgments is\ndetermined by something (the total influences) that can underdetermine\nthe state, hence does not always match the state.\n\nExceptions exist. When mathematicians vote on the truth of a\nmathematical conjecture, the correct decision is given by logical\nfacts, hence is never underdetermined. Even then, individual judgments\nand (finite or asymptotic) group judgments can be incorrect, because\nof a positive probability that the objectively accessible truth is not\nsubjectively recognized, say due to subjectively misleading evidence,\nintransparent logical facts, or distracting circumstances.\n\nThe lesson is that the infallibility hypothesis is untenable under\nPossible Underdetermination, and dubious even without Possible\nUnderdetermination. The next subsection will, however, discuss a\nspecial scenario in which the group is asymptotically\ninfallible.\n4.3 Unlimited evidence generation?\n\nPerhaps the only possible case for asymptotic infallibility involves\nthe idea of unlimited evidence generation (or \u201cgenerated\nsignals\u201d in the words of Hong & Page 2009). What does this\nmean, and how plausible is it?\n\nAssume that each individual accesses independent private information,\non which alone their judgment is based, without any information\nsharing or dependence on common influences (assumed in Dietrich &\nList 2004). For instance, doctors perform independent tests on one and\nthe same patient to judge whether some virus is present, or chemists\nperform independent experiments to judge whether a liquid contains a\ngiven molecule. This private information is truth-conducive: given any\ntrue state, the information supports the true state with probability\nabove \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\u2014the same probability for each information\n(each individual). More problematically, private evidence is\nindependent given the true state. This rules out, implausibly, that\nany common causes (except the state itself) affect different private\ninformation: for instance, the patient\u2019s physiology cannot\naffect virus tests (possibly rendering all tests unreliable), and the\nliquid\u2019s acidity level cannot affect tests for the molecule\n(possibly rendering all tests unreliable). Under these questionable\nassumptions, majority judgments are asymptotically infallible, as the\n(State-)Conditional Jury Theorem applies.\n\nSuch a scenario of fully private and independent information escapes\nthe problem of common causes\n (Section 2.2)\n and the tension between independence of competence\n (Section 2.4),\n but only by excluding hidden common influences, excluding\ninformational exchange between individuals, postulating an ever\nextendable rather than fixed body of information, and thereby\nindirectly excluding underdetermination of the truth discussed in\n Section 4.2.[16]\n An individual \u201ccreates\u201d new independent information (in\nthe examples: through \u201cexperiments\u201d) rather than facing\nthe same shared information as others. Increasing the group thus adds\ninformation, not interpretations of information. This unlimited\navailability of independent information might be approximately\nrealistic in decision problems where information is\nproduceable (say, through experiments) rather than merely\nobservable. But political and other real-life decision\nproblems come with a limited and possibly difficult body of known or\nknowable facts, causing asymptotic fallibility.\n4.4 The problem of incredible truths\n\nSome truths are hard to recognize as they are highly specific, and\nthus unlikely to hold. Recognizing that global temperature will\nrise may be easy, but recognizing that it will rise by 2.3\nDegrees Celsius is hard. Whenever some choice alternative (and\nthus its correctness) is highly specific, competence in jury models is\nthreatened. Suppose a climate panel must form a belief about the\nproposition \\(p\\) that global temperature will rise by 2.3 degrees.\nSomeone\u2019s competence given \\(p\\) (more generally, given facts\nthat entail \\(p\\)) can easily fall below \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), because\ncorrectly recognizing \\(p\\) is hard. Indeed, the available evidence\nmight be compatible with a temperature rise close to, but distinct\nfrom 2.3 degrees. The other effect of \\(p\\)\u2019s high specificity\nis that competence given not-\\(p\\) (more generally, given facts that\nentail not-\\(p\\)) can become very high, because not-\\(p\\) is a very\nunspecific and thus \u201ccredible\u201d proposition. The lesson is\nthat highly unbalanced choice alternatives\u2014a highly specific\nalternative against a highly unspecific alternative\u2014bring the\ncompetence assumption of the Conditional Jury Theorem to fall.\n\nBy contrast, the competence assumptions of Condorcet\u2019s and the\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem, UC and TC, are not vulnerable to\nthis problem. Why?\n\nUC pertains to the general (\u201cunconditional\u201d)\ncompetence of an individual \\(i\\), \\(P(R_{i})\\), not their specific\ncompetence given facts \\(x\\), \\(P(R_{i}|x)\\). General competence stays\nabove \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), because the (error-conducive) event of the\n\u201cspecific truth\u201d is much less likely than the\n(truth-conducive) event of the \u201cunspecific\n truth\u201d.[17]\nTC explicitly allows (specific) competence to sometimes fall below\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n\nThe problem of incredible truths is a variant of Estlund\u2019s\n(2008: 232\u20134) \u201cdisjunction problem\u201d and of problems\ndiagnosed in List (2005) and Dietrich and Spiekermann (2020).\n4.5 Deliberation: independence underminer or competence booster?\n\nTwo intuitions compete: does deliberation primarily threaten\ncollective epistemic success, by reducing judgmental independence,\nor primarily increase epistemic success, by raising\nindividual competence?\n\nThe first intuition needs nuancing. Deliberation reduces\nunconditional judgmental independence, by adding common\nsources of votes; see\n Section 3.4\n and\n Figure 4.[18]\n Thus, deliberation further undermines Condorcet\u2019s (naive)\nUnconditional Independence axiom. But deliberation does not undermine\nthe Conditional Independence axiom of the Conditional and the\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem, provided one conditionalises on\ncommon\n causes.[19]\n\nTurning to the second intuition, deliberation certainly affects\ncompetence. Since deliberation tends to widen the basis of judgments\n(see again\n Section 3.4),\n the effect on competence tends to be positive, as one may conjecture.\nAll three competence axioms considered in\n Section 2\n would then hold more easily with deliberation than without. This\nconjecture is illustrated in\n Figure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Three examples where\ndeliberation improves competence. Grey: pre-deliberation. Black:\npost-deliberation. [An\n extended description of Figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nPlots a, b and c refer to the competence axiom of Condorcet\u2019s,\nthe Conditional, and the Competence-Sensitive Jury Theorem,\nrespectively. In all three plots, the competence axiom is violated\npre-deliberation, and holds post-deliberation\u2014 an extreme\nexample where deliberation is of vital importance. In Plot a,\ndeliberation lets general competence \\(P(R_{i})\\) move from 0.4 to 0.8\npost-deliberation, so that Condorcet\u2019s competence axiom UC\nbecomes satisfied. In Plots b and c, the distribution of specific\ncompetence across facts moves upwards, making the respective\ncompetence axiom satisfied.\n\nTo be clear, deliberation sometimes distorts judgments. Sometimes\nmisleading evidence and other judgment-deteriorating sources are\nshared, opinion cascades occur, bad opinion leaders emerge, etc.\n(e.g., Sunstein & Hastie 2014). So the hypothesis that\ndeliberation improves competence should be qualified: deliberation\nusually improves judgments, thereby helping competence axioms\nlike UC, CC and TC become satisfied.\n4.6 Group-dependent individual competence\n\nThe increasing-reliability hypothesis is threatened not only if\nadditional group members are less competent than existing members\n (Section 3.2),\n but also if existing members lose competence when the group\ngrows too much. Firstly, the deliberation process, to which members\npartly owe their competence\n (Section 4.5),\n can become less fruitful: some bodies are too large for successful\ndeliberation. Secondly, large \u201canonymous\u201d bodies can\ndemotivate members, who feel individually less responsible and spend\nless effort on forming correct judgments. The opposite effect is also\nimaginable: adding members can improve deliberation and motivation.\nBodies can be too small, not just too big (see the debates over\noptimal parliament size, e.g., Elster 2012).\n\nAll this puts a fundamental assumption of jury models into question:\nthe assumption that someone\u2019s judgment and thus competence are\ngroup-independent, hence, for instance, are the same in a 3-member\ngroup (with small-scale deliberation) as in a 333-member group (with\nlarge-scale deliberation). This denies any effects of group dynamics\non judgments.\n\nTo model group-dependence, the event \\(R_{i}\\) that an individual\n\\(i\\) is correct should be replaced by group-size-dependent\ncorrectness events \\(R_{i,n}\\) for all group sizes \\(n\\) such that\n\\(n\\geq i\\) (i.e., such that the group includes \\(i\\)). An individual\n\\(i\\)\u2019s competence, general or specific, becomes a\ngroup-size-dependent quantity, given by \\(P(R_{i,n})\\) or\n\\(P(R_{i,n}|\\mathbf{x})\\), respectively. One might hypothesize that\ncompetence is an initially increasing and subsequently falling\nfunction of \\(n\\), which therefore peaks at some \u201cindividually\noptimal\u201d group size \\(n_{i}\\). If one replaces the ordinary\nassumption of group-independent judgments by the latter hypothesis,\nthen the increasing-reliability conclusion of jury theorems will still\nhold when restricted to group sizes \\(n\\) of at most the individual\noptimum \\(n_{i}\\) of each individual group member \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\).\nThe collectively optimal group size can exceed the individual\noptima of all individuals \\(i\\), because the merits of drawing on many\nminds can outweigh individual competence losses. But the collective\noptimum can become finite, against the increasing-reliability\nhypothesis.\n4.7 Epistemic-strategic voting\n\nConventional jury models implicitly assume that individuals share the\nsame objective of a correct collective decision. Surprisingly, this\nassumption does not rule out strategic voting. To the contrary, voters\nmay vote against what they believe to be correct in order to\nfacilitate a correct aggregate decision.\n\nThis can be called epistemic-strategic voting, because voters\nstrategise out of a shared epistemic objective rather than conflicting\ninterests. How is this even possible? Suppose a 9-member jury reaches\na guilty-or-innocent verdict by majority. A juror reasons:\n\n\nI believe in guilt. My vote only makes a difference if it is pivotal,\ni.e., if my jury colleagues are split 4:4. So, let me assume this\nsplit. But then four (competent) colleagues believe in innocence. So\ninnocence is more likely than I thought. The higher probability of\ninnocence justifies an \u201cinnocent\u201d verdict. So I shall vote\ninnocent.\n\n\nShe votes on the basis, not of her beliefs, but her conditional\nbeliefs assuming pivotality. If everyone reasons alike, no one reveals\ntheir genuine judgment. Votes reflect no private information or\ninsights, and collective decision are arbitrary. Defendants are\nunanimously acquitted even when everyone believes in guilt.\n\nFortunately, this absurd situation is no more stable than sincere\nvoting. Why? The strategic reasoning leading to non-sincere voting\ncannot be universalised: it assumes others vote sincerely. Indeed, our\nexample juror assumes her colleagues are sincere in her \u201cBut\nthen\u201d inference.\n\nEpistemic-strategic voting has been addressed game-theoretically,\nusing jury models enriched by voters\u2019 private information; see\nAusten-Smith and Banks (1996), Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1999), Peleg\nand Zamir (2012), Bozbay, Dietrich, and Peters (2014), and many\nothers. The generic finding is that sincere voting by everyone is no\n(Nash) equilibrium, but that the rationality of sincere voting can be\nrestored by carefully adjusting the aggregation rule, raising a\nproblem of procedure (\u201cmechanism\u201d) design rather than\ngroup\n design.[20]\n\nBut is epistemic-strategic reasoning and voting really plausible?\nThere are three very different objections. Firstly, voters may be\nboundedly rational and unable (or unwilling) to strategise. Secondly,\nvariations of the decision procedure, possibly introducing pre-voting\ndeliberation can make strategic voting less likely (e.g., Coughlan\n2000; Gerardi & Yariv 2007). Thirdly, and most interestingly,\nsincere voting becomes perfectly rational under a richer and arguably\nmore realistic picture of voter motivation, where the narrowly\nconsequentialist concern for correct collective outcomes is replaced\nor complemented by a concern about the act of voting itself, often an\nintrinsic concern for being sincere, or for expressing one\u2019s\nopinion, or for complying with norms of sincerity. The literature\ncontrasts instrumental and expressive voting (Brennan & Lomasky\n1993; Schuessler 2000). Why do expressive concerns (even if just\nsmall) easily crowd out instrumental concerns, so that sincerity\nbecomes rational? The reason is that, in sufficiently large groups,\nthe probability of being pivotal, i.e., of affecting the outcome, is\nsmall, so that the instrumental concern almost cancels out when\nsolving the voter\u2019s optimisation problem. So, strategic voting\nmay well be a game-theoretic artifact of ascribing purely instrumental\npreferences to voters.\n5. Other Types of Jury Theorems\n\nThe jury theorems discussed above apply to binary choices and majority\nrule. This section defines the epistemic aggregation problem more\ngenerally\n (Section 5.1),\n and then discusses jury theorems for aggregating votes over multiple\nalternatives\n (Section 5.2),\n aggregating estimations\n (Section 5.3),\n aggregating evaluations or grades\n (Section 5.4),\n aggregating judgments over interconnected propositions\n (Section 5.5),\n and aggregating votes of voters tracking individual facts\n (Section 5.6).\n Many theorems reach the implausible infallibility conclusion; the\ncritical analysis of this conclusion\n (Section 2)\n continues to apply.\n5.1 The epistemic aggregation problem more generally\n\nAn epistemic aggregation problem has the following components.\n\nAlternatives, votes, and aggregation. Let\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be a non-empty set of \u201calternatives\u201d in\nthe most general sense\u2014e.g., choice alternatives, belief or\njudgment sets, or value assignments to options. A decision-making\ngroup selects one alternative based on the members\u2019 votes,\napplying some aggregation rule \\(F\\) that maps each profile\n\\((a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\in\\mathcal{A}^{n}\\) of any number \\(n\\geq 1\\)\nof votes to a decision \\(F(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) (or\nperhaps a subset \\(F(a_{1} ,\\ldots,a_{n})\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}\\), to\nallow for indeterminate\n outcomes).[21]\n For example, for majority rule (assuming \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) contains\njust two alternatives), \\(F(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\) is the alternative\nin \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) occurring more than \\(n/2\\) times among\n \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\).[22]\n\nAggregation problems in which voter inputs and collective decisions\ndiffer in type (rather than both belonging to the same set\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\)) can also be of\n interest.[23]\n We set them aside here.\n\nCorrectness, state, and votes. Each alternative\npossesses a \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d value,\nquality, or correctness level. If alternatives are beliefs or belief\nsets, value usually depends on truth; if alternatives are evaluations\nof objects, value might depend on distance to correct evaluations;\netc. Value is determined by an unknown \u201cstate\u201d. Let\n\\(\\mathcal{S}\\) be the non-empty set of possible states. The\nvotes of individuals \\(1, 2, \\ldots\\) and the state are interpreted as\nthe outcomes of random variables \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\) \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2},\n\\ldots\\) with range \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) with range\n\\(\\mathcal{S}\\), respectively. One can be more or less\nsophisticated:\n\nThe \u201csimple\u201d standard of correctness\ndistinguishes between just two correctness levels,\n\u201ccorrect\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d, and identifies the\nstate with the (single) correct alternative:\n\\(\\mathcal{S}=\\mathcal{A}\\). Epistemic performance is measured by\ncorrectness probability, i.e., probability that the judgment matches\nthe state. So, individual \\(i\\)\u2019s performance is measured by\n\\(P(\\mathbf{v}_{i}=\\mathbf{s})\\), and collective performance by\n\n\\[P(F(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n})=\\mathbf{s}).\\]\n\nUnder a more general (\u201cgraded\u201d) standard of\ncorrectness, each pair \\((a,s)\\) of an alternative and a state is\nassigned a number \\(V(a,s)\\), the value or correctness degree of \\(a\\)\nin state \\(s\\). This defines a value function \\(V\\) from\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Epistemic\nperformance is measured by expected decision value: \\(\\mathbb{E}\n(V(\\mathbf{v}_{i},\\mathbf{s}))\\) measures individual \\(i\\)\u2019s\nperformance,\n\\(\\mathbb{E}(V(F(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}),\\mathbf{s}))\\)\nmeasures collective performance. This general case is more flexible.\nIt can, for instance, distinguish between type-1 errors (like false\nconvictions) and type-2 errors (like false acquittals). The simple\nstandard of correctness is a special\n case.[24]\n\n\nThe problem. While much of epistemic social choice\ntheory seeks to optimize the aggregation rule \\(F\\) given a fixed\ngroup size \\(n\\), jury theorems are an exception. They fix \\(F\\) and\nvary \\(n\\), addressing how collective epistemic\nperformance\u2014measured by correctness probability or more\ngenerally expected decision value\u2014depends on group size.\nNotorious questions are: does performance increase in group size\n(increasing reliability) or peak at some finite group size? And how\nwell does the collective perform in the limit?\n5.2 Social choice between multiple alternatives\n\nOne can state jury theorems that apply at once to several aggregation\nrules and choice problems, showing that almost nothing hinges on the\nclassic focus on binary choice and majority rule (Pivato 2017). More\nconcretely, List and Goodin (2001) analyse plurality rule over some\nfinite set of alternatives\n \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).[25]\n Adopting the simple standard of correctness (see\n Section 5.1),\n they show that the plurality outcome is asymptotically infallible\nunder essentially classical assumptions of independence, homogeneity,\nand competence. Specifically, given a correct alternative\n\\(a\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), the individuals must vote following independent\nand identical probabilities, and vote for the correct alternative\n\\(a\\) with higher probability than for each incorrect alternative.\nInterestingly, this correctness probability need not exceed 0.5, but\nonly exceed the probability of each incorrect vote. One may conjecture\nthat under these assumptions the plurality outcome is not only\nasymptotically infallible, but also increasingly reliable.\n5.3 Aggregating estimates\n\nAssume the group must estimate or predict some real-valued quantity,\nsuch as inflation, income inequality, or global temperature. Here,\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a real interval, e.g., \\(\\mathcal{\\mathbb{R}}\\) or\n\\([0,1]\\), containing the possible estimates. Let the group aggregate\nmembers\u2019 estimates by taking their average (rather than their\nmedian, as in Galton\u2019s 1907 classic paper on the wisdom of\ncrowds). Formally, \n\\[F(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\\]\n\n\nfor any group size \\(n\\) and any individual estimates\n\\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\in\\mathcal{A}\\). The state \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) is the\ntrue amount in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) (\\(=\\mathcal{S}\\)). Assume that,\nconditional on the state \\(\\mathbf{s}\\), the individual estimates\n\\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots\\) are\n\nindependent,\nidentically distributed, and\ncorrect in\n expectation.[26]\n\n\nCondition (i) and (ii) reflect familiar ideas of voter independence\nand homogeneity. Condition (iii) captures competence as unbiasedness.\nThen, by Kolmogorov\u2019s (1930) (strong) Law of Large Numbers, the\naverage estimate \\(F(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n})\\) converges\nto the true state \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) with probability one as \\(n\\) tends\nto\n infinity.[27]\n This implies asymptotic\n infallibility.[28]\n\nThis turns the Law of Large Numbers into a jury theorem for\naggregating estimates. Its independence and homogeneity assumptions\ncould be significantly\n weakened.[29]\n But the (suspicious) unbiasedness condition is essential, raising\nconcerns about this jury theorem.\n5.4 Aggregating evaluations or grades\n\nSome option, prospect, or other object is being evaluated\n(\u201cgraded\u201d) in terms of some criterion. A painting might be\nevaluated in terms of beauty: is it \u201cbeautiful\u201d,\n\u201cneutral\u201d, or \u201cugly\u201d? An academic applicant\nmight be graded in terms of research skills. Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be a\nfinite set of possible grades, linearly ordered from\n\u201chighest\u201d to \u201clowest\u201d. The state\n\\(\\mathbf{s}\\) is the true value or grade in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\n(\\(=\\mathcal{S}\\)). Each group member assigns a grade. The resulting\ngrading profile \\((a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\) is aggregated into the\nmedian grade \\(a=F(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\), i.e., the middle\ngrade after putting \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\) into a weakly increasing\norder \\(a_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, a_{n}^{\\prime}\\) (to ensure medians\nexist, let \\(n\\) be odd). If, for instance, a painting is evaluated\ntwice as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and once as \u201cugly\u201d, where\n\\(n=3\\), then the median evaluation is \u201cbeautiful\u201d. Given\nan instance \\(s\\) of the state, consider a voter \\(i\\)\u2019s\ncorrectness probability \\(P(\\mathbf{v}_{i}=s|s)\\), over-valuation\nprobability \\(P(\\mathbf{v}_{i}>s|s)\\), and under-valuation\nprobability \\(P(\\mathbf{v}_{i}<s|s)\\). The absolute difference\nbetween the over- and under-valuation probability defines\n\\(i\\)\u2019s bias, i.e., tendency to over- or under-value.\nMorreau (2021) proves a \u201cgrading-jury theorem\u201d: if,\nconditional on any state, the grades\n\\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots\\) are (i) independent, (ii)\nhomogeneously distributed, and (iii) sufficiently unbiased (i.e., with\nbias below the correctness probability), then the correctness\nprobability of the median evaluation increases in (odd) group size and\nconverges to\n certainty.[30]\n The correctness probability can become very small, provided it\nexceeds the bias. Having small bias seems particularly difficult if\nthe true value is very high or very low, since extreme values are\neasily under- or over-estimated.\n5.5 Judgment aggregation over interconnected propositions\n\nIn judgment aggregation, a group forms yes/no judgments on several\npropositions (List & Pettit 2002; Dietrich 2007; and see the entry\non\n belief merging).\n The group might judge whether economic growth will increase\n(proposition \\(p\\)), whether some climate goals will be missed\n(proposition \\(q\\)), and whether the former implies the latter\n(proposition \\(p\\rightarrow q\\)). The three judgments are\ninterconnected: one cannot consistently accept \\(p\\), \\(p\\rightarrow\nq\\), and \\(\\lnot q\\). Let alternatives be complete and consistent\njudgment sets; in the example, \n\\[\\mathcal{A}=\\{\\{p,p\\rightarrow q,q\\},\\{\\lnot p,p\\rightarrow q,q\\},\\ldots\\}.\\]\n\n\nThe state \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) is the correct judgment set in\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) (\\(=\\mathcal{S}\\)), containing the true propositions.\nSomeone\u2019s competence can vary across propositions. The\npropositions on which someone is competent, i.e., likely to judge the\ntruth value correctly, form her area of competence.\n\nEpistemically successful judgment-aggregation rules tend to rely on\nindividual judgments where individuals are competent. How, in the\nexample, should the group judge whether \\(q\\), i.e., when should the\ncollective judgment set contain \\(q\\) and when \\(\\lnot q\\)? The\n\u201cconclusion-based procedure\u201d adopts the majority judgment\non whether \\(q\\). The \u201cpremise-based procedure\u201d adopts the\nlogical implication of the majority judgments on whether \\(p\\) and\nwhether \\(p\\rightarrow\n q\\).[31]\n Which of these two prominent procedures is more likely to find out\nthe truth about \\(q\\) depends, roughly speaking, on whether\nindividuals are primarily competent on \\(q\\) or primarily competent on\n\\(p\\) and \\(p\\rightarrow q\\). The situation gets complicated if\nindividuals have different areas of competence.\n\nFurther complications arise if not only correctness on \\(q\\), but also\ncorrectness on \\(p\\) and \\(p\\rightarrow q\\) matter. Technically, this\nrefines the standard of correctness by which judgment sets in\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) are evaluated, i.e., the epistemic\n objective.[32]\n Being correct about \\(p\\) and \\(p\\rightarrow q\\) may matter in\nitself. Alternatively, judgments about \\(p\\) and \\(p\\rightarrow q\\)\nmay count as reasons for the judgment about \\(q\\), and it may matter\nto be right about \\(q\\) for correct reasons. Reasons or\njustifications matter in many real examples. For example, courts\nshould not only make correct sentences (convict or acquit), but also\njustify them correctly in terms of facts and laws.\n\nJury theorems capturing these and other insights are developed in List\n(2005) and Bovens and Rabinowicz (2006).\n5.6 Jury theorems for voters tracking individual facts\n\nOrdinary jury theorems assume the classic paradigm of epistemic\ndemocracy: collective decisions should be correct, and individuals\nvote for what they believe to be correct. But collective correctness\ncan emerge even if voters do not pursue it. For instance, decisions\ncan serve the collective interest even if voters vote for what they\nbelieve serves their personal interest. This is the message of\njury theorems for voters tracking individual facts. They\nfollow a semi-epistemic paradigm of democracy: collective decisions\nshould still be correct, but voters express judgments about individual\nfacts.\n\nWithin this paradigm, what vote is correct depends on the individual.\nThe rationale could be that votes express judgments about\nagent-indexed facts, for instance about which alternative is best\nfor oneself, i.e., serves one\u2019s own interest.\nObviously, correctness of judgments like \u201coption X is\nin my interest\u201d is voter-dependent. An entirely\ndifferent rationale for voter-dependent correctness is that\ncorrectness facts are subjective\u2014a meta-ethical thesis sometimes\nadvanced for normative facts. Either way, an individual might not know\nwith certainty which alternative is individually correct (e.g., serves\ntheir own interest or is subjectively correct). Individual competence,\nin this framework, is the ability to track one\u2019s own correctness\nfact.\n\nWhich truth does the group track in its aggregate decision?\nThe collective correctness standard combines the individual standards.\nCollective correctness could, for instance, be defined as correctness\nfor most\n individuals.[33]\n The natural procedure to track this collective truth is majority\nvoting (assuming there are just two alternatives). Still, majority\noutcomes may be collectively incorrect, as individuals may cast\nindividually incorrect votes. Yet, under some stylized assumptions,\nincluding broadly Condorcetian competence and independence\nassumptions, majority voting can generate increasingly reliable and\npossibly asymptotically infallible outcomes (see theorems conjectured\nby Miller 1986 and List & Spiekermann 2016).\n\nBut this standard of collective correctness can be questioned. It\nrests solely on how often an alternative is individually\ncorrect. Yet it might also matter how strongly\nsomeone\u2019s correctness standard (e.g., her welfare) is satisfied\nor violated. This becomes evident in concrete\n examples.[34]\n To account for degrees, let a correctness standard be given by a\nvalue function \\(V\\), assigning a value or correctness degree to each\nalternative, formally \\(V:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\). If\n\\(V_{1},V_{2},\\ldots\\) are the (unknown) value functions of the\nindividuals \\(1,2,\\ldots\\), respectively, how valuable or correct are\nalternatives collectively? Under an additive approach, the\ncollective value function is \\(V_{1}+\\cdots+V_{n}\\). If individual\nvalue represents individual welfare or interest, then such additive\ncollective value represents utilitarian collective welfare; but\nnothing hinges on a welfarist interpretation of value. An alternative\nin \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is now correct (individually or collectively) if it\nmaximises the relevant value function. Here collective correctness no\nlonger reduces to correctness for most individuals.\nPivato\u2019s (2016) statistical utilitarianism\ntheorem\u2014initially a theorem about making approximately\nutilitarian-optimal decisions\u2014can be interpreted as a jury\ntheorem for individual correctness of this graded kind and collective\ncorrectness of additive\n kind.[35]\n\nJury theorems with voters tracking individual facts depart from\nordinary jury frameworks and classic epistemic democracy in two\nfundamental ways. First, different voters track different\n\u201ctruths\u201d, against the epistemic conception of democracy.\nSecond, the collectively correct alternative depends on group size\n\\(n\\), hence is a moving target that changes as voters are added.\nStill, such theorems make a remarkable point: voting in pursuit of the\nindividual good can create the collective good, as if through an\ninvisible hand. Democracy finds the collective truth even if voters\nsearch for different, purely individual, truths. But does democracy\nfind the collective truth more easily if voters express\njudged individual truth or judged collective truth? This is an open\nquestion for epistemic democracy.\n6. Background and Selected Applications\n6.1 Jury theorems and democratic theory\n\nWhether masses can be wise and should be entrusted with important\ndecisions is a question with long philosophical pedigree. The Athenian\ndemocracy increased the decision body compared to its oligarchic\ncompetitors, demonstrating that such an enlargement can engender\ncollective epistemic success (Ober 2008; 2013). Against this backdrop,\nthe philosophical debate about the epistemic performance of democracy\nbegan. Aristotle, for instance, despite being generally sceptical of\nthe rule by the people, concedes the possibility of group wisdom\n(Aristotle, Politics: 1281a11; Waldron 1995), though this\nreading is contested (Cammack 2013; Lane 2013).\n\nWhile the epistemic advantages of drawing on many minds had been\ndebated long before Condorcet, he is the first to develop a\nprobabilistic framework akin to modern jury theorems and to focus\nexplicitly on voting mechanisms. Condorcet\u2019s remarkable advance\nmay also have rubbed off on his contemporaries. Jean-Jacques\nRousseau\u2019s argument for popular rule was influenced by\nCondorcet\u2019s thought and resembles an informal statement of his\ntheorem, according to an influential article by Grofman and Feld\n(1988) (but see Wyckoff 2011 for a critical take on that historical\nspeculation).\n\nWhile Condorcet\u2019s jury theorem largely falls into oblivion after\nhis death, the mathematical take on aggregation which he had initiated\nremains. Francis Galton, for example, stumbles over useful data for\ntesting the epistemic performance of belief aggregation when visiting\na cattle fair in 1906. Galton observes a weight-judging competition:\nparticipants were asked to guess the slaughtering weight of an ox,\nsubmitting their guesses in writing. To Galton\u2019s surprise, the\nmedian guess was within 0.8% of the actual weight, beating by far the\nindividual judgments. While Galton does not directly invoke a jury\ntheorem, he notes that\n\n\nthe middlemost estimate expresses the vox populi, every other\nestimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the\nvoters. (Galton 1907)\n\n\nCondorcet is a founding father of social choice theory, not only\nbecause of his jury theorem. When Duncan Black (1958) famously\nrediscovers his work, his jury theorem receives new attention in\npolitical science and democratic theory (Grofman 1975 seems to have\ncoined the term \u201cCondorcet Jury Theorem\u201d). However, the\ninitial reception is not friendly: Black (1958: 163) dismisses the\nidea of an independent standard of correctness in elections and John\nRawls (1971 [1999]: 315) doubts that votes could be sufficiently\nindependent. Brian Barry (1965 [2010: 205\u20136]) is perhaps the\nfirst twentieth-century political theorist to affirm the importance of\nthe theorem for democratic theory.\n\nContemporary democratic theory remains divided on jury theorems.\nBroadly speaking, the field distinguishes between instrumental and\nprocedural arguments for democracy (Dworkin 1987; List & Goodin\n2001; Anderson 2009). Recent years have seen increasing interest in\ninstrumental, and especially epistemic arguments. But even among\nepistemic democrats (early proponents are Cohen 1986; Coleman &\nFerejohn 1986; see Schwartzberg 2015 for an overview), the merits of\njury theorems are controversial. Some epistemic democrats regard jury\ntheorems as central tools for justifying democracy (e.g., List &\nGoodin 2001; Landemore 2013; Dietrich & Spiekermann 2013a; Goodin\n& Spiekermann 2018). Others disagree. Henry S. Richardson (2002),\nfor example, rejects Condorcet\u2019s independence assumption. David\nEstlund instead rejects Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption\n(Estlund 2008: ch. 12) and dismisses Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem as\nproviding \u201ctoo shaky a basis\u201d (Estlund 2008: 223).\nElizabeth Anderson also objects to Condorcet\u2019s implausible\nassumptions and conclusions (Anderson 2006).\n\nSuch debates in political philosophy were hampered by a focus on\nCondorcet\u2019s initial version of the theorem with its problematic\nassumptions and conclusions (see\n Section 2);\n these objections often lose weight for other jury theorems.\n\nGrofman and Feld fan worries about deliberation by attributing to\nRousseau the view that \u201ceach voter is polled about his or her\nindependently reached choice, without any group deliberation\u201d\n(1988: 570). Unsurprisingly, since many democratic theorists see\npublic deliberation as instrumentally or intrinsically valuable, the\nproposal to sacrifice deliberation for independence was not met with\nenthusiasm. Recent debates in democratic theory, however, have turned\nto conditional notions of independence which can better accommodate\ndeliberation and fruitful exchange, thereby also avoiding the\ncontroversial infallibility conclusion (cf.\n Section 2\n and\n Section 4.5).\n\nSome epistemic democrats worry that an exaggerated focus on jury\ntheorems (and aggregation more generally) suppresses other important\nepistemic mechanisms, such as democratic experimentation (Anderson\n2006; Fuerstein 2008), individual learning as opposed to aggregation\n(M\u00fcller 2018), distributed search, deliberation, and learning.\nCertainly, jury theorems are only one building block; a\ncomprehensive epistemic analysis of collective decision-making also\nneeds models of such other mechanisms. Nevertheless, jury theorems can\nassist the epistemic analysis of institutions and help assess\npolitical representation, bicameralism, epistemic division of labour,\npolitical cue taking, the merits of diversity, and the dangers of\nexcessive bias, to name just a few applications (Goodin &\nSpiekermann 2018). Jury theorems have also been used to analyse legal\ninstitutions, including the importance of legal precedent and, of\ncourse, the (in)correctness of jury verdicts (e.g., Vermeule 2009;\nFeddersen & Pesendorfer 1998; Coughlan 2000).\n6.2 Jury theorems and social epistemology\n\nSocial epistemology can be roughly divided into epistemology\nof groups and epistemology in groups (Dietrich and\nSpiekermann forthcoming). Jury theorems matter to the former, and\nindirectly also to the latter.\n\nEpistemology of groups analyses how groups can be knowers and\nhow they perform as knowers. A lively debate among applied social\nepistemologists explores how (and how well) different institutions\npromote group knowledge. Alvin Goldman\u2019s seminal Knowledge\nin a Social World (1999), for example, draws on Condorcet\u2019s\nJury Theorem in his social-epistemological analysis of democracy. The\ndebate extends to courts (Spiekermann & Goodin 2012; Sunstein\n2009; Vermeule 2009), to the internet (Masterton, Olsson and Angere\n2016), and even to knowledge of the scientific community and its\nperception by the wider public (Hahn, Harris, & Corner 2016).\nStretching the boundaries of social epistemology further, one could\neven say that animal decision-making can be more or less conducive to\ngroup knowledge (e.g., Conradt & List 2009).\n\nJury theorems matter more indirectly to social epistemology\nin groups, especially belief revision under peer\ndisagreement. How ought one revise one\u2019s beliefs when learning\nthe beliefs of others? Many have argued that the number of peers,\ntheir competence and their independence all matter (Elga 2010; Kelly\n2011; Lackey 2013). Barnett (2019), for example, discusses peer\ndisagreement with a \u201cgroup representative\u201d who adopts the\ngroup\u2019s majority view. Jury theorems can help approach such\nquestions systematically.\n\nThe jury theorem literature also offers analyses of opinion\nindependence in social contexts, distinguishing between different\nnotions of independence: causal independence,\nprobabilistic (\u201cstatistical\u201d,\n\u201cevidential\u201d) independence, and reasoning\nindependence (a form of autonomy of agents); see\n Section 2.2 and\n Lackey (2013). None of these notions entails another, but they are\noften unhelpfully mixed up.\n6.3 Jury theorems and epistemic social choice theory\n\nIf viewed mathematically, jury theorems belong to epistemic social\nchoice theory, a branch of social choice theory (see the entry on\n social choice theory).\n Social choice theory studies aggregation procedures in groups. Like\ndemocratic theory, social choice theory has a procedural and an\nepistemic branch. Procedural social choice theorists want procedures\nto be intrinsically \u201cdemocratic\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d to\nindividuals; they formulate axiomatic requirements on procedures\ncapturing normative principles (such as anonymity or Paretianism) and\nask which procedure(s) satisfy\n them.[36]\n Epistemic social choice theorists instead want procedures to\n\u201ctrack the truth\u201d; they formulate some epistemic criterion\non outcomes (e.g., high probability of correctness) and analyse\nprocedures in terms of how well their outcomes satisfy the\ncriterion.\n\nJury theorems fall into the epistemic camp. What distinguishes them\nwithin epistemic social choice is the focus on decision-body size\nrather than more conventional procedural parameters, such as the\nacceptance threshold in a supermajority rule or the individual weights\nin a weighted voting rule. Jury theorems seek to optimize group size\ngiven a procedure (e.g., given majority rule), rather than\noptimizing the procedure given a group size. Procedure\noptimisation is sometimes possible analytically. The generic finding\nis that, under a classical independence assumption, the epistemically\noptimal procedure in binary choices is a weighted (simple, super- or\nsub-) majority rule in which a voter\u2019s weight is a well-defined\nincreasing function of competence (which becomes negative for\ncompetence below \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)); see, e.g., Nitzan and Paroush\n(1982), Ben-Yashar and Nitzan (1997), Dietrich (2006), and Pivato\n(2013). Simple majority rule can be far from optimal; in suitable\ncircumstances, it is optimal if voters are equally competent\nand options are initially equally likely correct.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anderson, Elizabeth, 2006, \u201cThe Epistemology of\nDemocracy\u201d, <em>Episteme</em>, 3(1\u20132): 8\u201322.\ndoi:10.3366/epi.2006.3.1-2.8", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2009, \u201cDemocracy: Instrumental vs.\nNon-Instrumental Value\u201d, in Thomas Christiano and John Christman\n(eds.), <em>Contemporary Debates in Political Philosophy</em>,\nChichester: Wiley Blackwell. pp. 213\u2013227.", "Aristotle, <em>The Politics</em> (Cambridge Texts in the History\nof Political Thought), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1988.", "Austen-Smith, David and Jeffrey S.
