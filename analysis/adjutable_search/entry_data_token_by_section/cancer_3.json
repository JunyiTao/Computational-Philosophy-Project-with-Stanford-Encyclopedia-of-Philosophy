The question is ambiguous, and\nfraught. For, by \u201ccancer\u201d one could have several targets\nof explanation in mind: the general process of transformation of a\ncell into a \u201ccancer cell,\u201d a very general characterization\nof the process of carcinogenesis as a whole, the process of invasion\nand metastasis in solid tumors in particular, the emergence and roles\nof intratumor heterogeneity, differential rates of incidence of\ndifferent cancer types, patterns of cancer incidence or mortality in\ndifferent environments, socioeconomic groups, races, ages, or sexes.\nEach of these explanatory targets arguably calls for quite different\nkinds of explanation, and not merely different explanatory\ninformation. The fact that these explanations are different in kind\nmay (in part) explain why there appears to be such a variety of views\namongst philosophers concerning the aim and character of explanation\nin cancer research, drawing upon a long history of debate among\nphilosophers of biology concerning norms of explanation (See the\nentries on\n scientific explanation\n and\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n Perhaps not surprisingly, also, there is also a history of dispute\namongst cancer scientists about competing research agendas and norms\nof explanation.\n",
