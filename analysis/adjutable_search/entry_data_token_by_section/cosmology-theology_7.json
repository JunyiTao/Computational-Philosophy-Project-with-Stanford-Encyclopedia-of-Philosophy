Quantum and string cosmologies\n\nAs we mentioned previously, there are reasons to suspect the\ninvalidity of classical general relativity in regions near a\nsingularity\u2014most importantly, for times very close to the big\nbang. In particular, when lengths are very small, and curvature and\ntemperatures are very high, then\u2014if the gravitational force\nbehaves like all other known forces of nature\u2014quantum effects\nwill take over, and we should accordingly expect different outcomes.\nThis observation is itself sufficient to destroy the aspirations of\nbig-bang theology\u2014unless there are good reasons to think that\nthe finite-age prediction of relativistic cosmology will be preserved\nin a quantum gravity or in string theory. In this section, we briefly\nreview the known data about singularities in theories that attempt to\nunify gravity and quantum mechanics. Our review supports two\nconclusions: (1) We do not know yet if the best model will predict a\nfinitely old universe, but (2) there are good reasons to think that\nthe big bang is not necessarily an absolute beginning.\n\nThere have been a number of proposed theories of quantum cosmology.\nPerhaps best known of these is the proposal of Stephen Hawking, which\nresults in a universe with no boundary\u2014motivating the famous\nquestion, \u201cwhat place, then, for a creator?\u201d The bearing\nof Hawking\u2019s cosmology on theism has already been discussed\nextensively by Craig & Smith (1995), Deltete & Guy (1997),\nCraig (1997), and Smith (1998). But it would be ill advised to take\nHawking\u2019s theory as giving the final version of quantum\ncosmology. As noted by Drees (1990), Hawking\u2019s approach is just\none among several competing attempts to incorporate quantum effects\ninto relativistic cosmology, and we are not compelled to accept its\nidiosyncratic metaphysical picture. More to the point, Hawking\u2019s\ncosmological model is ad hoc in the sense that it does not\nflow from a more comprehensive unification of general relativity\nquantum theory. In this section we turn to two cosmological theories\nthat do result from systematic and comprehensive unifications of\ngeneral relativity and quantum theory: loop quantum cosmology and\nstring cosmology.\n\nLoop quantum cosmology (LQC) is an approach to cosmology within the\nframework of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) program (Rovelli 2004),\nwhich itself starts with the idea that unifying quantum theory and\ngeneral relativity will require \u201cquantizing\u201d the\ngravitational field\u2014and hence the structures of spacetime\nitself. Roughly speaking, to quantize a theory means that the\nquantities (e.g., position, momentum, scalar curvature, etc.) are\nreplaced by \u201cmatrices,\u201d or more generally with\n\u201coperators on a Hilbert space.\u201d This replacement can have\nprofound physical consequences, most particularly the spectrum of a\nquantity (i.e., the numerical values it can possess) can become\ndiscretized where it was previously continuous, or bounded where it\nwas previously unbounded, and quantities can be forced to obey a\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nFor our purposes, the important question is what happens to those\nquantities (e.g., spatial curvature) that grow unboundedly large in\nclassical FRW spacetimes as the time parameter t approaches the\ninitial boundary time t0? To answer this question\nrequires going through intricate technicalities involving domains of\ndefinition of operators, etc.. To summarize, however, the most\nprominent proposal (championed primarily by Martin Bojowald and\ncollaborators; see Bojowald 2009) results in a scale parameter\nS(t) that is bounded away from zero, entailing that\ncurvature is bounded from above. More is true: the dynamical equations\nof LQC extend through the big bang, i.e., the universe existed\nbefore the big bang.\n\nIt would be premature to take loop quantum cosmology as having\ndecisively overturned the big-bang, finite-age cosmological model.\nNonetheless, there is a non-negligible probability that it will do so\nin the near future; and hence there is a non-negligible probability\nthat the big bang is not the beginning of the universe, and a\nfortiori, not the creation event (even if there was one).\n\nHowever, loop quantum gravity is not the most popular\u2014in terms\nof sheer number of researchers\u2014approach to unifying quantum\ntheory and gravity. The title of most popular belongs to string\ntheory, and so string theory\u2019s perspective on the big bang event\nis of crucial interest for those wishing to assess the bearing of\nphysical cosmology on traditional theological doctrines.\n\nAll indications from string cosmology point to the fact that the\nuniverse existed before the big bang. In particular, string theory\nclaims that if we apply fundamental symmetry transformations to\ncosmological models of the recent universe, then we get a copy of the\nuniverse (with important quantities inverted) that might be called the\n\u201cpre-big-bang universe.\u201d In this scenario, the absolute\nbig bang disappears and is replaced by a saddle point in the dynamical\nevolution of spacetime curvature: before this point, curvature is\nincreasing, and after this point, it is decreasing.\n\nAccording to Gasperini (2008), string cosmology\u2019s prediction of\na pre-big-bang universe results from a principled application of\nsymmetry principles. Furthermore, string theory has a built in\nmechanism (namely a minimum string length) that seems to rule out\nsingularities of infinite curvature or spatial length shrinking to\nzero. As was the case in LQC, the values of physical quantities in\nstring theory are constrained by quantum mechanical laws; and so some\nquantities that grew beyond bounds in classical theory are\nwell-behaved in quantized versions of that theory.\n\nWe currently lack the empirical data that would distinguish between\ncompeting models of quantum cosmology. But these models make different\nempirical predictions from each other, and they also make different\npredictions from classical relativistic cosmology. Hence, it is an\nempirical, rather than a metaphysical, question whether the big bang\nwas the beginning of the universe.\n\nHowever, just as the big-bang is not unambiguously friendly to theism,\nso quantum cosmology is not unambiguously hostile to theism. Indeed,\nChris Isham (1993, 405) has suggested that quantum cosmology\u2019s\ndescription of a boundary-free universe accords quite well with\ntheism\u2019s insistence that God sustains the universe at all times.\n(See also the discussion in Drees 1988, 1990, 1991.) Clearly, theism\nhas shown some flexibility in integrating its doctrines with\nprevailing scientific worldviews\u2014as evidenced, e.g., in the\nintegration of Aristotelian cosmology, and in the exploitation of\nbig-bang cosmology. Should we expect the situation to be any different\nwith quantum cosmology?\n",
