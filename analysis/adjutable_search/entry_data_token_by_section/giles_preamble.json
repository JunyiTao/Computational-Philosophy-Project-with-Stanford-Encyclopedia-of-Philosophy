    "main_text": "\n\n\nGiles of Rome (who died in 1316 as archbishop of Bourges) was one of\nthe most productive and influential thinkers active at the end of the\n13th century, who played a major role also in the political events of\nhis time. Giles of Rome was an extremely prolific author and left a\nvery large corpus of writings, encompassing commentaries on Aristotle,\ntheological treatises, questions, and sermons. In the last couple of\ndecades, a research group originally led by Francesco Del Punta\n(Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy; died in 2013) has been\ndevoting a lot of energy to the project of publishing his Opera\nOmnia and deepening our knowledge of his thought. Although this\ngroup has produced extremely significant results, enriched by the\ncontributions of other scholars, an assessment of Giles\u2019 whole work is\nstill in progress. For this reason, the present entry only aims at\nproviding insight into an ongoing process of research.\n",
