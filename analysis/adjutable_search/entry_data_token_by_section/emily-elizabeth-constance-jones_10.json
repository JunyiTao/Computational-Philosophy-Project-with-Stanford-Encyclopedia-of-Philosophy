Related Criticisms of Russell\n\nAn important related criticism, not acknowledged by Russell in\nsubsequent writings (it appeared after his response to Jones in\n\u201cKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description\u201d)\nis a critique of a famous passage in Principia Mathematica.\nIn arguing that descriptions are incomplete symbols and have no\nmeaning in isolation, Russell claims that although \u2018Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley\u2019 expresses an identity, \u2018the\nauthor of Waverley\u2019 cannot be a name. If it were, then\nit would be a value of c in the propositional function\n\u2018Scott is c\u2019. But this would mean that\n\u2018Scott is the author of Waverley\u2019 expresses what\n\u2018Scott is Scott\u2019 expresses, which is absurd:\n\nThe \u201cauthor of Waverly\u201d cannot mean the same as\n\u201cScott,\u201d or \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverly\u201d would mean the same as \u201cScott is\nScott\u201d which it plainly does not; nor can the \u201cauthor of\nWaverly\u201d mean anything other than \u201cScott\u201d\nor \u201cScott is the author of Waverly\u201d would be\nfalse. Hence the \u201cauthor of Waverly\u201d means\nnothing. (Whitehead and Russell 1910, 67)\n\n\nJones observes:\n\nGranted that Intension and Denotation are\ndifferently defined, this argument seems to depend on a double use of\nthe word meaning\u2014thus: when it is said that the author of\nWaverley cannot mean the same as Scott,\nmeaning signifies intension or connotation; plainly intension\n(or connotation) of the author of Waverley and of\nScott, cannot be the same. But when it is said that the\nauthor of Waverley cannot mean anything other than\nScott, or Scott is the author of Waverley would be\nfalse, \u201cmean anything other than Scott\u201d must be\nunderstood of denotation; if Scott and the author of\nWaverley are two distinct persons, clearly Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley must be false. (My identity-in-diversity\ntheory removes the difficulty at once.) (Jones 1910\u201311,\n175\u201376)\n\n\nJones\u2019s point can be summarized as follows. When Russell argues\nthat \u2018author of Waverly\u2019 cannot mean the same as\n\u2018Scott\u2019 because this would imply that \u2018Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley\u2019 and \u2018Scott is Scott\u2019\nexpress the same proposition, he uses \u2018meaning\u2019 in an\nintensional sense: \u201cplainly intension (or connotation) of\nthe author of Waverley and of Scott, cannot be the\nsame.\u201d But when he argues that \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019 must mean the same thing as\n\u2018Scott\u2019, he uses \u2018meaning\u2019 in the denotational\nsense. Russell\u2019s premises, disambiguated, can be recast as\nfollows: \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 and\n\u2018Scott\u2019 cannot have the same intension; \u2018the author\nof Waverly\u2019 and \u2018Scott\u2019 must have the same\ndenotation. From these, it does not follow that \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019 has neither denotation nor\nconnotation\u2014that it lacks meaning.\n\nJones seems to be perfectly correct here. The Principia\nargument intending to show that descriptions such as \u2018the author\nof Waverly\u2019 have no meaning in isolation assumes that\nan expression can only possess one kind of meaning\u2014and thus that\nsameness of meaning is either sameness of intension or sameness of\ndenotation\u2014and Jones is quite right to challenge this. (But see Perkins 2011 both for an alternative reading of the text as well as a useful history of the debate surrounding its interpretation.) \n",
