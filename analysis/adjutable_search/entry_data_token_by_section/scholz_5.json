    "main_text": "Work || Logic and Foundations\n3.2 Logic and Foundations\n\nThe year 1921 marks a big change in Scholz\u2019s focus of\nphilosophical research. He himself tells the story that he discovered\nhis love for mathematical logic by accidentally coming across\nWhitehead\u2019s and Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica\n(Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313, cf. Peckhaus 2005) in the\nlibrary of the University of Kiel. This work convinced Scholz of the\nsignificance of mathematics, although he had no deeper knowledge of\nthis subject at that time. As a full professor of philosophy he\ndecided to begin formal university studies of mathematics and\ntheoretical physics. After having moved to M\u00fcnster, Scholz\nfocused his research on mathematical logic and foundations.\n\nHe worked particularly on the borderline between mathematics and\nphilosophy, motivated by the problem of distinguishing logical calculi\nfrom general calculi. He supported David Hilbert\u2019s foundational\nprogram having led to metamathematics and proof theory, but focused on\nlanguage and semantics. Language is necessary to present logical\nsystems. He suggests a formalized language with a degree of exactness\neven exceeding the exactness of mathematical languages. He calls this\nlanguage \u201cLeibniz language\u201d L (cf. Scholz 1944).\nLeibniz languages are symbolic languages with exactly defined means of\nexpression. Each expression is a finite string of characters using a\ngiven symbolism according to well-determined rules. If the means of\nexpression are restricted in such a way that (1) these expressions\nalways have sense, and (2) it is decidable whether the produced\nexpressions are true in all possible worlds (universally valid,\nallgemeing\u00fcltig), then L is called a\n\u201cUniversal Leibniz Language\u201d. A universally valid\nfundamental expression is called a Leibniz Theorem. A logic calculus\nis defined as a set of truths presentable by a Leibniz theorem over\nL.\n\nThe close relation between logic and metaphysics is the topic of\nScholz\u2019s book Metaphysik als strenge Wissenschaft\n(Scholz 1941). In this book metaphysics is dealt with as an ontology\nin the sense of a theory comprising the entirety of truths. It can be\nlinguistically expressed and deals with things which can be understood\nas individuals. These truths are not restricted to particular domains,\nbut are valid for all non-empty domains in all possible worlds (pp.\n13\u201314). Metaphysics as a rigorous science implies the\nconstruction of a formalized \u201cprecision language\u201d. In this\nbook Scholz uses the language of first order predicate calculus with\nidentity. A central notion is \u201cuniversal validity\u201d\n(Allgemeing\u00fcltigkeit), understood as a metaphysical\nnotion (validity in all possible worlds). This notion is applied to an\naxiomatized theory of identity and difference.\n\nScholz analyzed classical metaphysical doctrines with his logical tool\nof a predicate calculus with identity. His considerations are based on\na special variation of a Platonic ontology combined with\nLeibniz\u2019s notion of possible worlds, the Frege-Russell\nmathematical logic, Hilbert\u2019s axiomatic method, and\nTarski\u2019s semantics. This approach found its final expression in\nthe influential textbook Grundz\u00fcge der mathematischen\nLogik which was elaborated, co-authored, and published by Gisbert\nHasenjaeger after Scholz\u2019s death (Scholz and Hasenjaeger 1961).\nHasenjaeger later called its philosophical background \u201cdiscrete\nontology\u201d, a realistic position: \u201cThe world of concrete\n(or also abstract) things consists just of things\nwhich have some features and do not have others; between them some\nrelations are given, others not\u201d (Hasenjaeger 1962, pp.\n30\u201331).\n\nIn 1952 Scholz published together with Hans Hermes the section\n\u201cMathematische Logik\u201d in the Enzyklop\u00e4die der\nMathematischen Wissenschaften (Hermes and Scholz 1952), a\ncomprehensive survey of classical, bivalent and decidable logic. They\nfocused on sentential logic based on the notion of universal validity\n(Allgemeing\u00fcltigkeit). They argued for the priority of\nsemantical over syntactical considerations.\n",
