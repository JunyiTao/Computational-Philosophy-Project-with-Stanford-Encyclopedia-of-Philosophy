    "main_text": "Philosophy || Eternity of the world\n3.4 Eternity of the world\n\nBoethius\u2019 On the Eternity of the World is not about\neternity in the theological a-temporal sense, but about sempiternity,\nexistence in a time that neither had any beginning nor will have any\nend. The crucial question is \u201cDoes the notion of a temporal\nbeginning, a creation, make philosophical sense\u201d. Boethius holds\nthat there is no way to definitely prove or disprove that the world is\n\u201cnew\u201d, i.e., that it has come into existence a definite\ntime ago. He refutes arguments purporting to show the actual\nsempiternity of the world, but not arguments adduced to show that such\nsempiternity is possible, while he characterizes traditional\nwould-be proofs of a temporal beginning as invalid\n(\u201csophistic\u201d).\n\nThe central piece of the work is a demonstration that no branch of\nphilosophy can prove the \u201cnewness\u201d of the world. The\nnatural scientist cannot, because that would require relying on an\nassumption that is not included in the principles of his science and\nwould make them an inconsistent set if included. The natural scientist\ncan explain how something comes into being by some pre-existing matter\nacquiring a form, but that is generation, not creation, and nature\nonly produces new things through generation. Hence, the natural\nscientist can neither, qua natural scientist, assume the\ncreation of the world and the existence of a first man nor the reality\nof the future resurrection; indeed, he must deny all three. To the\nmathematical sciences it simply does not matter whether the world is\nnew or sempiternal. Neither can a metaphysician deliver the desired\nproof. In the first place, the metaphysician cannot demonstrate that\nan effect may be delayed in relation to its sufficient cause; i.e.,\nmetaphysics presupposes the principle \u201cIf a sufficient cause is\nposited, so is its effect\u201d (posita causa sufficiente ponitur\neffectus). Second, there is no way a metaphysician may prove that\nthe world is not coeternal with the divine will, for that would\nrequire an insight into the divine will that is not accessible to\nhumans; claiming to have such insight amounts to madness, Boethius\nsays.\n\nSo, the upshot of the discussion is that when doing natural science\none should stick to Aristotelian principles, but remember that\nqua scientist one is limited to dealing with what is\naccessible to human reason, so that while conceding the necessity of a\nconclusion deduced from natural causes one may still concede that\nthings may be factually different due to the First Cause.\n\nAt the end of the treatise Boethius lashes out at people like bishop\nTempier, who cannot understand how it is possible to be a Christian\nand a philosopher at the same time: \n\n\nIf someone, whether enjoying a position of dignity or not, cannot\nunderstand such difficult matters, then let him obey the wise man and\nlet him believe in the Christian Law, (Wippel\u2019s trl. [1987: 67])\n\n\n\nbut, he adds, \u201cfaith is not knowledge/science\u201d.\n",
