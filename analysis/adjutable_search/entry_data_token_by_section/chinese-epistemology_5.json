    "main_text": "Specific Features || Onto-Epistemology\n2.3 Onto-Epistemology\n\nIn the Chinese holistic tradition epistemology is inseparable from\nontology, as in its view of the world every object of cognition is\nalso cognition itself; the manner of its existence is thus linked to\nour understanding of it. Because this connection goes both ways, i.e.,\ntheir relation is not a relation of single sided dependency and\ndetermination, but an interaction that includes mutual co-dependency,\nwe cannot state that this is a solipsistic conceptualization of the\nworld. The same as can be said for the perception of the existing\nworld can also be said for its comprehension and interpretation. This\ncannot be separated from the wholesome, but changeable and totally\nindividualized existence of objects of cognition; this is clearly\nmanifested in the theoretical system of the so-called\nonto-hermeneutics (benti quanshi xue\n\u672c\u9ad4\u8a6e\u91cb\u5b78), which was developed by\nChung-ying Cheng (Cheng Zhongying) (see Nelson 2011: 335; Cheng\n2008).\n\nIn the work of the representatives belonging to the realist currents\nof Neo-Confucian philosophy, as well as in the later developments\nwhich took place during the 16th, 17th and\n18th centuries, especially in the formation processes of\nnew methodologies and the processes of incorporating the Buddhist\nthought, this unity of reality and comprehension was modified through\na gradual constitution of a dualistic demarcation line manifesting\nitself in the differentiation between the subject\n(zhu\u4e3b, neng \u80fd) and the object\n(ke \u5ba2, suo \u6240) of recognition. This\ndemarcation line has been additionally strengthened by the subsequent\ninfluence of Western philosophy from the 19th century\nonwards. The search for a synthesis between the classical Chinese\nparadigm of the unity of existence and (its) perception on one side,\nand the dualistic view, according to which both realms are mutually\nseparated on the other, led to the modern debates on the priority of\nontology and epistemology. These debates culminated in several\nattempts to revive, modernize and re-establish the classical Chinese\nview of structural, organic and dynamic links between ontology and\nepistemology.\n",
