By\ngranting the principle of sufficient reason unlimited validity Maimon\nembraces a radical form of rationalism. His robust criteria for the\nvalidity of knowledge suggests that even Kant\u2019s attempt to limit\nepistemological claims to the realm of possible experience cannot be\nsecured without a substantial metaphysical commitment. Kant faces a\nsevere choice: either adopt elements from the dogmatic, rationalist,\nmetaphysics he set out to challenge, or accept that his system is\nundermined by skepticism about his critical idealism. In revealing\nwhat he sees as the skeptical implications of rationalism, Maimon\nraises important objections to Kant\u2019s critical idealism, as well\nas develops deep insights into the problems of experience and\ngivenness. His \u2018skeptically rationalist\u2019 claims about the\nnature and limits of human cognition present a distinctive perspective\non the Kantian project of transcendental idealism, as well as on\ncentral epistemological issues concerning the relation between thought\nand the world. The eminent German scholar, Manfred Frank recently\nsuggested that Maimon is the \u201clast great philosopher\u201d\nabout to be discovered.\n", "toc": [{"#InteBiog": "1.

Intellectual Biography\n\n\u201cScholars of Wisdom have no rest in this world or in the\nworld to come.\u201d\n\nThis Talmudic saying, with which Maimon concludes his first\nphilosophical work, the Essay on Transcendental Philosophy\n(1790), applies strikingly well to the life story of Salomon Maimon.\nMaimon was born in 1753 in Suchowyborg (Sukowy Borek), a village on\nthe tributary of the Nieman river, next to the town of Mir (Mirz) in\nLithuania. His family, which originally was rather wealthy, fell into\npoverty due to poor management of its properties. Thus, Maimon\u2019s\nfather became a children\u2019s teacher, an example that was followed\nlater by his son Salomon. Maimon received a traditional religious\neducation, which concentrated mainly on the study of the\nTalmud. At the age of 11, shortly after the death of his\nmother and following a comedy of errors involving the mothers of two\nyoung girls, Maimon was married in an arranged ceremony, and three\nyears later, in 1767, his first son, David, was born. During his early\nadulthood, Maimon developed a keen curiosity about the sciences and\nphilosophy. The most crucial influence was that of Maimonides\u2019\nGuide of the Perplexed, through which Maimon became\nacquainted with Aristotelian philosophy in its medieval cloth, and\nwith the iconoclastic spirit of Maimonides\u2019 philosophy of\nreligion. Maimon\u2019s attachment to Maimonides \u2014 both\npersonally and philosophically \u2014 ran throughout his life. Even\nMaimon\u2019s own name was adopted as an expression of respect\ntowards this teacher. (At the time, few Jews adopted family names.\nBefore taking the surname \u2018Maimon\u2019, Maimon used to be\ncalled after his father: Salomon ben (\u201cson\nof\u201d) Joshua.) Maimon also developed an interest in\nKabbalistic texts, which in spite of his relatively young age, he\nattempted to study and interpret according to the bodies of knowledge\nhe had already mastered (i.e., Maimonidean philosophy). Around 1770\nMaimon went to visit the court of the Maggid (The\nPreacher) of Mezrich, the contemporary leader and one of the\nfounders of Hassidism. Maimon\u2019s visit seems to have\nlasted no more than a few weeks; still it is clear that he was\nstrongly impressed by this new form of religious life and its teaching\nof self-annihilation in God. Maimon dedicates a chapter and half of\nhis 1792/3 Lebensgeschichte to the portrayal of early\nHassidism, and these chapters are indeed the most valuable external\nhistorical source on the emergence of Hassidism. Maimon passes a\nnegative judgment on some aspects of Hassidism, still even from the\nlate perspective of his writing in the 1790s his enthusiasm about some\nfeatures of the movement (such as, the use of improvisation in\nexpounding the Torah) are salient. Recent scholarship on Hassidism\nconfirmed virtually all of the teaching\u2019s Maimon quotes in the\nname of the Maggid and his disciples (see Melamed 2018). It is also\nremarkable that the story of Maimon\u2019s visit to the court of the\nMaggid is documented in Hassidic sources which describe Maimon as one\nof the disciples of the Maggid \u201cshe-shana\nu-firesh\u201d (\u201cwho studied and reneged\u201d). See\nHoizman (1962, 261\u201362). Maimon\u2019s discussion of Hassidic\npantheism is highly sympathetic, and occasionally he alludes to the\nsimilarities between Hassidic acosmism, and Spinozism.\n\nIn his mid-twenties, hoping to widen his knowledge of philosophy and\nthe sciences, Maimon left his family and went to Berlin (under the\npretense of attempting to study medicine there). This first visit to\nBerlin ended shortly and grimly. Having confided to one of the\nofficers of the Jewish community that the purpose of his visit was to\nstudy philosophy and that he intended to publish a new commentary on\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide of the Perplexed, Maimon was asked to\npack his belongings and leave the shelter of the Jewish community\n\u2014 and thus the city \u2014 at once. The following half year\nMaimon spent as a wandering beggar. Eventually, he and his beggar\nfriend decided to return to Poland. As they reached the border town of\nPosen, Maimon\u2019s talent and erudition were recognized by the\nchief rabbi of the town, and he was offered a shelter and a position\nas a tutor at the house of one of the city\u2019s Jews. During his\nstay in Posen Maimon wrote one of his Hebrew works, Hesheq\nShelomo (\u201cSolomon\u2019s Desire.\u201d See the\nBibliography).\n\nIn 1780 Maimon, went again to Berlin. This journey was much more\nsuccessful and Maimon established a close connection with Moses\nMendelssohn and entered the circles of the Haskala (the\nJewish Enlightenment movement) in Berlin. Yet neither Berlin nor its\nenlightened Jews provided a real home for Maimon. For the cultured\nJews of Berlin, Maimon was a rude Ostjude (East-European\nJew), who spoke awful German accompanied by a variety of wild\ngesticulations. They did, however, acknowledge the genius of this\nperson, who could, for example, read a difficult book of mathematics\nfor the first time, and then explain it \u2014 in his savage manner\n\u2014 a short while later. Similarly, Maimon had little appreciation\nfor these fine bourgeois who, free from any barriers which would\nimpede their ability to study the sciences, only contented themselves\nwith a shallow acquaintance with what a civilized person\nshould know. Furthermore, they lacked the sharpness of mind\nof his fellow Talmudists in Poland. Maimon does seem to have had a\ngenuine appreciation for Mendelssohn, both because of his\nkindheartedness and because, unlike most others of the circles of the\nJewish Enlightenment, Mendelssohn had a reasonable grasp of the\nTalmud and rabbinic literature.\n\nIn 1783, Mendelssohn asked Maimon to leave Berlin due to\nMaimon\u2019s open Spinozism and his bohemian lifestyle. After a\njourney to Hamburg, Amsterdam and then back to Hamburg, Maimon entered\nthe Gymnasium Christianeum in Altona, where he stayed for two years.\nDuring this period Maimon studied several European languages and\nimproved his knowledge of the natural sciences and his command of\nGerman. In 1785, Maimon left Altona for Berlin, where he met\nMendelssohn for the last time. Later that year Maimon moved to Dessau,\nwhere he wrote a Hebrew textbook on mathematics, and subsequently\nsettled in Breslau. Here, after a failed attempt to study medicine,\nMaimon again took up the position of a tutor. While staying in\nBreslau, Maimon translated Mendelssohn\u2019s Morgenstunden\ninto Hebrew (a manuscript which is now lost) and wrote a Hebrew\ntextbook of Newtonian physics \u2014 Ta\u2019alumoth Hochma\n(\u201cMysteries of Wisdom\u201d). After more than a decade\nof separation, Maimon\u2019s wife, Sarah, accompanied by their eldest\nson, David, succeeded in locating him in Breslau, and demanded that he\neither return to Lithuania or get a divorce. Reluctant to sever his\nties with his past, Maimon tried to postpone the decision, but after\nhis wife insisted that he must make the choice, he finally agreed to\nthe divorce.\n\nIn 1787 Maimon traveled again to Berlin. There he heard about\nKant\u2019s new philosophy, and for a couple of months dedicated\nhimself to a careful study of the Critique of Pure Reason. In\nhis Autobiography, Maimon alludes to his \u201crather\ncurious\u201d methods for understanding this text:\n\nIn the first reading I reached a vague sense of each section, which\nthrough subsequent readings I then sought to make determinate, and by\nthis to penetrate the meaning of the author. This is what is properly\nmeant when one thinks oneself into a system. Since I had already used\nthis method in mastering the systems of Spinoza, D. Hume, and Leibniz,\nit was natural that I would be led to think of them as a\n\u2018Coalition-System.\u2019 This I actually discovered, and by and\nby set it out in the form of notes and observations on the\nCritique of Pure Reason (GW I, 557 | LB 253).\n\n\nMaimon put his thoughts about the Critique in a letter he\nsent to Kant through a common friend, Markus Herz. Kant responded in a\nletter full of praise for Maimon, describing him as \u201chaving an\nacumen for such deep investigation that very few men have\u201d and\nclaiming that \u201cnone of my critics understood me and the main\nquestions as well as Herr Maimon does.\u201d (Ak. 11:48)\n\nKant\u2019s recognition opened for Maimon the salons of Berlin as\nwell as the contemporary leading journals, in which Maimon started\npublishing. The story of the crude genius who came from the East and\npenetrated the heart of German philosophy became a common topic of\nsmall talk in these circles. In 1790, Maimon published an expanded\nversion of his comments of Kant\u2019s first Critique as the\nVersuch \u00fcber die Transcendentalphilosophie (\u201cAn\nEssay on Transcendental Philosophy\u201d). A year later, Maimon\ncollaborated with the members of the Jewish Enlightenment and prepared\na Hebrew commentary on Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the\nPerplexed. (The publisher decided to publish only the first part\nof this work, since he found Maimon\u2019s commentary much too deep\nphilosophically, and thus unfitting for the political purposes of\npropagating the ideology of the enlightenment among the Jews.)\n\nDuring the early 1790s, Maimon struck a close friendship with Karl\nPhilipp Moritz (the author of the first Bildungsroman, Anton\nReiser). Maimon became a frequent contributor and later the\nco-editor of Moritz\u2019s Magazin zur\nErfahrungsseelenkunde, which was in fact the first journal\ndedicated to the study of psychology. Following Moritz\u2019s death\nin 1793 Maimon attempted to find a new patron. He established a\nconnection with Goethe, who invited him to Weimar, yet because of\nreasons that remain unclear, this relationship did not succeed.\nMaimon\u2019s material life in that period was quite miserable. He\nlived in extreme poverty, and spent the little money he earned on\nalcohol \u2014 for the price of a drink one could buy his\nconversation in a tavern. In 1795, Maimon accepted a generous offer by\na young Silesian nobleman, Graf Heinrich Wilhelm Adolf Kalkreuth, and\nmoved to the latter\u2019s estate in Siegersdorf (currently:\nKozuchow) in Lower Silesia. From this time until his death in November\n22, 1800, Maimon led a quiet, though lonely and melancholic, life on\nKalkreuth\u2019s estate. In May 1800, Maimon wrote to Lazarus\nBendavid, one of his Jewish friends in Berlin, attempting to arrange\nhis return to Berlin \u2014 and to find financial support for that\npurpose \u2014 but this plan never materialized.\n\nIn the last decade of his life, Maimon wrote ten books, and numerous\narticles. The most important among these books (apart from the\nTranscendentalphilosophie) are his philosophical works,\nVersuch einer neuen Logik, oder Theorie des Denkens (An\nAttempt at a New Logic, or a Theory of Thinking) (1793),\nKritische Untersuchungen \u00fcber den menschlichen Geist, oder\ndas h\u00f6here Erkenntni\u00df und Willensverm\u00f6gen\n(Critical Investigations on the Human Mind, or the Highest Faculty\nof Knowledge and Will) (1797), and his Lebensgeschichte\n(Autobiography) (1792/3), which is his only work which\nachieved wide public recognition.\n2. Maimon\u2019s Critique of Kant\n\nIn the highly polarized German philosophical community in the 1790s,\nMaimon\u2019s intellectual allegiances remained rather ambiguous. In\na letter of 1791, Maimon wrote to Kant that while he found the\nskeptical part of the Critique of Pure Reason wholly\nconvincing, he harbored doubts about the more dogmatic aspects of\nKant\u2019s system. Kant, of course, viewed Maimon not as an ally,\nbut as the best of his critics \u2014 it remains an open question\nwhether Maimon saw himself as fundamentally a friend or foe of the\ncritical philosophy. At the very least, however, Maimon\u2019s\ncriticisms of the Critique aim at the core of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism, in particular because they engage with what\nMaimon sees as an internal problem for Kant\u2019s\nsystem.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious problem \u2014 and certainly one of the\nearliest \u2014 that Kant faces concerns the issue of the thing in\nitself. In order to account for the content of cognition, Kant\nnotoriously posits a thing in itself that stands outside of the realm\nof possible experience yet nevertheless serves as the causal source of\ncognitive content. This mysterious entity was attacked most famously\nby Jacobi, with his accusation that one could not enter into\nKant\u2019s system without the assumption of the thing in itself, but\nthat with such an assumption one could not remain within it. Maimon\ntoo was quick to point out that the thing in itself could not be\nunderstood realistically. Rather, Maimon argues, the thing in itself\nmust be understood not as a noumenal entity but rather as the complete\nconceptual determination of an object, which can be approached only\nasymptotically. Against Kant\u2019s claims about a noumenal realm of\nthings as they are in themselves, Maimon holds that the thing in\nitself stands only as an object of inquiry, rather than an\nindependent, noumenal entity: in a letter he notes that the thing in\nitself is \u201cnothing other than the complete cognition of\nappearances. Metaphysics is thus not the study of something apart from\nexperience, but rather merely of the limits (Ideas) of experience\nitself.\u201d (in Ehrensperger (2004), 250\u20131) As such, while\nMaimon agrees with Kant that since we are finite beings the thing in\nitself is in fact beyond the realm of possible experience, this does\nnot imply that the thing in itself cannot in principle be an\nobject of cognition.\n\nMaimon\u2019s criticisms of Kant\u2019s account of the thing in\nitself, however, are connected to a deeper concern about the notions\nof experience and cognition that stand at the heart of Kant\u2019s\ncritical idealism. Kant posits the thing in itself in large part\nbecause of his commitment to a type of cognitive dualism, in which\nhuman experience is taken to involve both a faculty of thought (the\nunderstanding), as well as a faculty of receptivity (sensibility). In\norder to have any content, experience requires data, which must be\ngiven to the subject through the senses. Moreover, the data of\nexperience cannot be produced by the faculty of thought itself. The\ngiven content of sensibility plays an ineliminable role in cognition,\nand its source must ultimately be traced to the subject\u2019s being\naffected by something distinct from itself, a role played by the thing\nin itself. But while the content of thought is provided by the\naffection of an object on the faculty of sensibility, the way in which\nthis content is cognized remains the purview of the faculty of the\nunderstanding. Mere affection, in other words, is not equivalent to\ncognition. In Kant\u2019s terms, the \u201cunderstanding is not\ncapable of intuiting anything, and the senses are not capable of\nthinking anything.\u201d (A52/B56)\n\nFor Maimon, Kant\u2019s cognitive dualism \u2014 which begins with\ndistinct faculties of cognition \u2014 fails to explain how the\nvarious elements can come together in a way that makes experience\npossible. On this objection, Kant cannot justify his assumption that\nconcepts and intuitions necessarily unite in cognition. In more\nKantian terms, Maimon calls into question Kant\u2019s answers to both\nthe quid facti and the quid juris that begin the\nTranscendental Deduction in the first Critique. According to\nMaimon, while the quid facti \u2014 the question of the fact\nof our use of a priori concepts in experience \u2014 is taken by Kant\nto be an unproblematic statement about the nature of human experience,\nthe very assumption that we in fact do possess the type of experience\nKant ascribes to us can be called into doubt. Kant\u2019s central\nargument in the Transcendental Deduction begins by assuming that\nexperience exhibits a \u2018dualistic\u2019 structure, but according\nto Maimon, this position is not warranted, since the presumed\nconstituent elements of experience (bare intuitions or concepts) are\nnever themselves objects of experience. For Maimon, Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental arguments remain mere \u2018castles in the air\u2019:\nwhile they might be valid, they fail to provide the \u2018fact of\nexperience\u2019 that would make them sound. From the beginning,\nthen, Maimon views Kant\u2019s transcendental project with\nsuspicion.\n\nThe precise force of Maimon\u2019s objections to Kant\u2019s claims\nin the Transcendental Deduction remains, however, a bit unclear.\nCertainly the criticisms are forceful against regressive\ninterpretations of Kant\u2019s argument, in which the Deduction\nbegins with strong premises about the nature and objectivity of our\nexperience, but other, less contentious premises perhaps fare better\nagainst Maimon\u2019s attack. And, as some commentators have noted,\nMaimon\u2019s own characterization of Kant\u2019s \u2018cognitive\ndualism\u2019 itself might be viewed with suspicion, since Maimon\nattributes to Kant the view that the faculties of sensibility and\nunderstanding are really distinct, when in fact Kant\u2019s\nconsidered position might be better understood as claiming only that\nthere is a modal distinction between the faculties (This is a point\nmade by Franks (2005), though Look (2017) challenges the claim that\nKant\u2019s distinction can be understood in solely modal terms;\nNisenbaum (2016) also offers a good discussion of this issue). But, at\nthe very least, Maimon\u2019s concerns demand that the Kantian\nattempt to clarify what remains a very obscure part of the Critical\nPhilosophy, and Maimon remains suspicious that any suitable answer is\npossible.\n\nThis suspicion becomes an explicit problem, Maimon claims, when the\nspecific structure of Kant\u2019s system is examined. Here, Maimon\nargues, the quid juris of the deduction \u2014 the question\nabout the legitimate use of the categories \u2014 can likewise be\ncast into doubt. While Kant claims in the Deduction that the a\npriori concepts of the understanding \u2014 the categories\n\u2014 are necessary conditions on the unity of the manifold of\nsensible data given in intuition, Maimon argues that such a position\nleads to serious problems for the later claims Kant makes in the\n\u2018Schematism\u2019 and \u2018Principles\u2019 sections of the\nCritique. According to Maimon, Kant cannot explain how\ndifferent categories are able to discriminate between different\nintuitive content. Using the example of causality, Maimon argues that\nKant has no way of explaining why some orders of perceptions represent\ncausal connections, and why other orders of perceptions are merely\nassociative. The reason for this claim is found in the fact that while\nKant grounds the category of causality in a necessary order of\nperceptions, his justification for this claim appeals not to the\ncontent of the perceptions, but only to their formal\n\u2018rule-governed\u2019 connection \u2014 but, as Maimon argues,\nany order of perceptions can meet this formal requirement.\nYet since the content of intuitions by itself does not contain any\ntemporal ordering, Kant explicitly bars an appeal to such content in\napplying the category of causality. As such, Kant\u2019s account of\ncognition faces a dilemma: either it must appeal to the content of\nexperience and so violate Kant\u2019s own strictures, or the\napplication of categories is merely arbitrary. Kant\u2019s central\nepistemological commitment \u2014 his \u2018cognitive dualism\u2019\n\u2014 then leads, Maimon claims, to insuperable problems.\n\nWhile Maimon\u2019s objections to Kant focus on specific issues that\narise in the Critique, they all rest on Maimon\u2019s\ncommitment to a type of \u2018skeptical rationalism.\u2019 Maimon\nnotes that in the Versuch \u00fcber die\nTranscendentalphilosophie the important problem of the quid\njuris was \u201cpresented in a much wider sense than that in\nwhich Kant takes it, and thereby [such a position] allowed a place for\nHume\u2019s skepticism in its complete power. On the other hand, the\ncomplete solution to this problem necessarily leads to Spinozistic or\nLeibnizian dogmatism.\u201d (GW I, 558 | LB 254) Maimon\u2019s\nposition is then dogmatically rationalist insofar as it endorses the\nstandards of reason found in Leibniz and Spinoza, but it remains\nempirically skeptical insofar as he agrees with Hume that such\nstandards of reason are never met in our experience of the\nworld\u2013he is, in pithy phrase, a \u2018rational dogmatist and an\nempirical skeptic.\u2019\n\nMoreover, in the face of the question of how the understanding can\nsubsume or comprehend a given object, Maimon notes that \u201cfor the\nKantian system, [which claims] that our sensibility and understanding\nare two entirely different sources of our cognition, this question is\n\u2026 unanswerable; on the other hand, for the Leibnizian-Wolffian\nsystem, in which both [sensibility and understanding] flow from the\nsame cognitive source (their difference consisting only in the grades\nof completeness of this cognition), the question can easily be\nanswered.\u201d (GW II, 63\u20134 | VT 63\u20134) But while Maimon\nsees in the dogmatism of Spinoza, Leibniz and Wolff a means of\navoiding the problems that attend Kant\u2019s \u2018cognitive\ndualism,\u2019 he remains a skeptic about whether this solution can\never be carried out.\n3. Content, Givenness, and Space and Time\n\nThe rejection of cognitive dualism raises a rather vexing problem for\nMaimon: if the content of cognition is not to be found in the\naffection of the merely passive faculty of sensibility, where does the\ncontent come from? On the face of it, of course, it seems clear that\nhumans are not wholly responsible for the world of experience, but\nrather encounter it; Maimon must provide some explanation of the\n\u2018given\u2019 content of experience without appealing to\nsomething like the Kantian cognitive dualism he finds so\nproblematic.\n\nAlthough the details of Maimon\u2019s answer to this problem remain\nobscure, the kernel of his position can be found in his analysis of\nwhat it is to be a finite cognizer. While Kant moves from the fact of\nour human finitude to the need for a \u2018given\u2019 element of\ncognition, Maimon claims that such a step need not be taken. Instead\nof characterizing finitude in terms of the need for a passive faculty\nof receptivity, Maimon insists that finitude only implies\nincompleteness in our cognition \u2014 but this incompleteness does\nnot warrant any conclusions about the provenance of the matter of\ncognition. The content of sensibility is simply that which is passive\nin cognition \u2014 namely, that upon which the understanding\noperates. The expression that content is given from \u2018outside of\nus,\u2019 Maimon writes, means only \u201csomething in a\nrepresentation of which we are conscious of no spontaneity, that is,\n(in view of our consciousness) a mere passivity without\nactivity.\u201d And, he continues, the word \u2018given\u2019\nsignifies not \u201csomething in us that has its cause outside of us\n\u2026 rather, [the given] means merely a representation, whose\nmanner of origin in us is unknown to us.\u201d (GW II, 203 |\nVT 203) What we take to be merely given to us in experience can in\nfact be explained in terms of a productive \u2014 and hence active\n\u2014 capacity of the mind, although the procedures of this activity\nremain unknown to us.\n\nIn this respect Maimon revives the Leibnizian notion that there is not\na difference in kind, but only in degree, between a finite and an\ninfinite intellect. Maimon argues that for an infinite intellect, all\nof the content of thought is consciously produced through the\nmind\u2019s own activity \u2014 by virtue of its infinity, nothing\nneeds to be given to such an intellect. By the same token, Maimon\nholds that we can think of finite cognizers in the same terms, but\nwith the crucial difference that finite minds are not aware of the\nproductive capacities that create the matter of experience. The\nsupposedly given content provided by sensibility, in other words, can\nin fact be explained in terms of the \u2018subconscious\u2019\nproductive capacities of the active mind. In this respect, Maimon\nargues that our minds are limited reflections of the divine or\ninfinite mind; our active powers are conscious, he claims, in\nmathematics, where we display a \u2018god-like\u2019 ability to\ncreate content according to rules of thought. Mathematical objects,\nthat is, are constructed according to the complete determinations of\nour concepts, rather than merely encountered in our sensible\ninteractions with the world. In the case of empirical content,\nhowever, the creative process remains uncognized, since the\n\u2018manner of origination\u2019 of empirical objects or the\ncomplete conceptual determination that guides construction remains\nunknown to us.\n\nThese \u2018subconscious\u2019 products become conscious to the\nfinite mind, Maimon claims, by being represented in space and time.\nThe contrast with Kant is again important, for while Kant claims that\nspace and time are forms of human intuition, Maimon maintains that\nspace and time are in fact the ways in which humans represent\nconceptual differences between thoughts. Space and time, that is,\n\u201care both concepts and intuitions, and the latter presupposes\nthe former.\u201d (GW II, 18 | VT 18) Space and time are concepts as\nrepresentations of the differences of things in general, but they are\nintuitions when they represent a particular sensible object in\nrelation to other sensible objects. As finite cognizers, we represent\nin space and time what we have not completely conceptualized. The fact\nthat we represent content spatially and temporally indicates only that\nthere is some incompleteness in our conception of the world, and not\nthat this content is provided by a realm of wholly independent\nobjects. Maimon claims that the representations of space and time as\nintuitions arise as the result of the faculty of imagination, which\nis, as he describes it, the faculty of fictions (GW III, 61 | PW 37).\nSpace and time are then taken to be fictions in that they add\nproperties to objects that are not present in the conceptual\ndetermination of these objects (for a sustained discussion of\nMaimon\u2019s more general treatment of philosophical fictions, which\nMaimon views as practically indispensable for our ordinary cognition,\nsee Breazeale (2017)). As such, they serve as \u201cnegative\ncriteria\u201d for the incompleteness of our knowledge of objects (GW\nV, 192 | VnL 134). Although we never have complete determination, we\ndo get nearer to the complete concept of an object. The fact\nthat we represent objects in space and time points to the fact that\nsomething remains to be determined \u2014 spatial or\ntemporal diversities, that is, must have their ground in some\nconceptual differences. The representations of space and time provide\nindications that \u201cthe concepts of experience, and consequently\nalso the determined relations of objects of experience, are\nincomplete.\u201d (GW V, 192 | VnL 134)\n\nThis emphasis on the fictional nature of spatial and temporal\nproperties again echoes the Leibnizian explanation of space and time\nas the representation of conceptual differences, but where Leibniz\nclaims that space and time are derived from monadic relations, Maimon\nargues that the intuitions of space and time are in fact a\npriori human forms of representation, or, in Maimon\u2019s\nterms, \u2018forms of difference\u2019. In order to represent an\nobject in space and time, Maimon maintains, the conceptual content\nthat grounds such a representation must contain a diversity in order\nto be represented spatially and temporally. An intuited visual field\nof homogeneous red, for example, would not be spatially represented,\nsince there would not be any diversity present. Spatiality would arise\nonly with the introduction of some distinct content \u2014 a spot of\ngreen in the red field, for example (for a very helpful account of\nMaimon\u2019s theory of fictions, see Schmid 2021).\n\nFor Maimon, the formal nature of space and time suffices to\nyield mathematical and geometric necessity. In mathematics, Maimon\nclaims, space and time are given a priori to the\nfaculty of cognition; the objects of mathematics are \u201cnothing\nbut space and time in all their possible modifications.\u201d\n(GW V, 184 | VnL 126) Mathematics, that is, relates to an\nobject given a priori, or rather \u201citself determines these\nobjects a priori.\u201d (GW V, 183 | VnL 125) The\nobjects of mathematics and geometry are then directly constructed or\ndetermined according to the understanding\u2019s a priori\nrules of production. For Maimon, as for Kant, the ground of the a\npriority and necessity of geometry and arithmetic lies in the need for\nthe construction and exhibition of concepts.\n\nSpace and time are then presented as a priori \u2018forms of\ndifference,\u2019 but a question remains about the content of\nexperience: the supposedly independent world of objects, in all of its\nvariety and multiplicity, still needs to be explained. On this\nquestion, unfortunately, Maimon\u2019s position is particularly\nobscure. In the Versuch \u00fcber die\nTranscendentalphilosophie, Maimon develops a theory about the\ncontent of experience in terms of what he calls \u2018infinitesimals\nof perception.\u2019 Here the invocation of the calculus is\ndeliberate, for he argues that the content of experience can be\nexplained in terms analogous to the way in which infinitesimals are\ntreated in mathematics. A line, for example, can be understood as\ncomposed of an infinite number of points, each of which stands in\nrelation to the others; moreover, these points are densely ordered,\nfor there are an infinite number of points between any two points. But\nwhile the differences between the points of the line are themselves\ninfinitely small, the relation between them is a determinate value\n\u2014 the slope, which can be calculated for any point on the line.\nLikewise, Maimon claims, the content of experience can be understood\nas analogous to a \u2018perceptible line\u2019 that is composed of\nan infinite number of smaller components, none of which is\nontologically distinct from the experience itself. On this view,\n\u201csensibility provides the differentials to a determined\nconsciousness; the imagination produces from these [differentials]\nfinite (determinate) objects of intuition; the understanding produces\nfrom the relations of these different differentials, which are its\nobjects, the relation from which arise sensible objects.\u201d\n(GW II, 31\u20132 | VT 31\u20132) In this sense, there is\n\u2014 at least in principle \u2014 no need to appeal to a content\ngiven from outside of experience; instead, experience is itself\ncomposed or \u2018integrated\u2019 from the posited infinitesimal\nelements of thought. As finite cognizers, we represent in\nspace and time the purely conceptual differences that are simply\npresented in thought. (A similar strategy for dealing with the problem\nof the thing-in-itself was developed a century later by the Marburg\nNeo-Kantians, especially Hermann Cohen.)\n\nThe theory of the infinitesimals of perception is both complex and\nexceedingly opaque, and perhaps for this reason it largely disappears\nfrom Maimon\u2019s later work (for more on infinitesimals, see Duffy\n2014). But despite its gradual diminution in Maimon\u2019s thought,\nthe spirit it reflects continues to be expressed in Maimon\u2019s\nsteadfast commitment to his \u2018skeptical rationalism\u2019. Both\nhis objections to Kant\u2019s account of cognition as well as his own\npositive project turn on a rejection of what might be called\n\u2018brute givens.\u2019 For Maimon, givenness stands in opposition\nto cognition, for he holds that no explanation can be provided for how\nmerely given content can be taken up in thought \u2014 how, that is,\nthe active faculties of thought can legitimately apply to a passively\nreceived given. By attempting to explain givenness within a larger\nframework of an active consciousness, Maimon presents a position that\navoids \u2014 at least in principle \u2014 the problems that Maimon\nsees with Kant\u2019s cognitive dualism.\n4. Logic and the Law of Determinability\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason Kant contemplates the\npossibility of a law that would govern the content of\nsynthetic judgements. This law is supposed to be a complement to the\nprinciples of non-contradiction and excluded middle, which govern the\nlogical form of both synthetic and analytic propositions. The\nlaw, which Kant terms \u201cThe Principle of Thoroughgoing\nDeterminability\u201d (Grundsatz der durchgaengigen\nBestimmung), states that \u201cof every pair of possible [and\nopposite] predicates, one of them must apply\u201d to every single\nthing [A573/B601]. As a result, every single thing would be thoroughly\ndetermined with regard to any pair of opposite predicates. This law\nseems to necessitate the idea of the sum total of all possibility, and\nas a further result, the concept of an ens realismus. Kant\nargues, however, that this derivation is not valid insofar as it\nattempts to apply a principle that is limited to possible experience\nto all things (including things in themselves) [A583/B661]. Like Kant,\nMaimon too suggests a transcendental principle that will govern\nsynthetic propositions with regard to their content and not their form\n(the latter being governed by the law of non-contradiction). In spite\nof these similarities, Maimon\u2019s Law of Determinability (Satz\nder Bestimmbarkeit) is significantly different from the one\noffered by Kant. The two laws not only differ with regard to their\ncontents, but they also serve different functions, and have different\nweight in the two systems. While the Kantian law has a relatively\nmarginal place within his systems (and is considered by many scholars\nas a mere residue of the metaphysical inheritance of Baumgarten and\nWolff), Maimon\u2019s law seems to be the crucial axis of his\npositive philosophy.\n\n\u2026 [T]he principle of determinability laid down in this\nwork is a principle of all objectively real thought, and\nconsequently of philosophy as a whole too. All the\npropositions of philosophy can be derived from, and be determined by\nit. (Between Kant and Hegel: Texts in the Development of\nPost-Kantian Idealism, George di Giovanni and H.S. Harris (trans.\n& ed.), 165 | Maimon, Gesammelte Werke, V 368).\n\n\nThe two laws also differ with regard to their domains of\napplicability. While Kant restricts his law to possible experience,\nMaimon argues that the demands of his law are satisfied only within\nthe domain of a priori thinking, and that empirical cognition\nfails to pass its test.\n\nThe main aim of Maimon\u2019s Law of Determinability is to provide a\ncriterion that would distinguish between syntheses that\nreflect a real connection between concepts, and\narbitrary syntheses, which result from the mere activity of\nthe imagination. Real syntheses are of crucial importance for Maimon,\nsince through this kind of syntheses we can create new concepts, and,\nin the case of a priori syntheses, even create genuine\nobjects. But whether this can actually come about is where\nMaimon\u2019s skeptical worries come to the fore. According to\nMaimon, in any real synthesis of a subject and a predicate, the\nfollowing two principles must be observed:\n\n\n(1) A principle for the subject in general: every subject\nmust be a possible object of consciousness, not only as a subject but\nalso in itself;\n\n(2) A principle for predicates: every predicate must be a\npossible object of consciousness, not in itself, but only as a\npredicate (in connection with the subject) What does not conform to\nthis principle can be a merely formal, or arbitrary,\nbut not a real thought (GW V, 78 | VnL 20).\n\n\nA synthetic judgment then accords with the law of determinability when\nits predicate is a real determination of the subject (i.e., when its\npredicate is asymmetrically dependent upon its subject). Thus, for\nexample, in the synthesis \u2018straight line\u2019, the predicate\n\u2018straight\u2019 is a real determination of the subject\n\u2018line\u2019, since one can think of the subject without the\nconcept of the predicate, while one can conceive of straightness only\nthrough the concept of a line. In an empirical synthesis, such as,\n\u2018red line\u2019, the predicate is merely an arbitrary\ndetermination insofar as our intellect does not decipher any internal\nconnection and dependence between the subject and the predicate (and\nsince we can easily imagine other subjects having the same predicate)\n(GW II, 92\u20133 | VT 92\u20133).\n\nRelying on the principle of determinability, we can distinguish\nbetween the subject and the predicate of a given synthesis, e.g., in\nthe synthesis \u2018acute triangle\u2019 we can see that\n\u2018triangle\u2019 can be thought without \u2018acute\u2019 but\nnot the other way around, and hence ascertain that \u2018acute\u2019\nis the predicate and \u2018triangle\u2019 the subject. Now, we can\nof course go one step further and try to unfold the concept of\n\u2018triangle\u2019. But here, the principle of determinability\ncould assist us only to a limited degree. It will not tell us what is\nthe genus under which \u2018triangle\u2019 falls. All it can do is\nto provide a negative criterion once we suggest such a genus.\nThus, the principle will tell us that \u2018triangle\u2019 is not a\ndetermination of a specific figure which I see in front of me (since I\ncan conceive of a triangle without thinking of the figure in front of\nme). Once I come with another candidate, such as \u2018space\u2019\nand suggest that \u2018triangle\u2019 might be a determination of\n\u2018space\u2019, the principle will approve this suggestion, since\nwe cannot think of a \u2018triangle\u2019 without\n\u2018space\u2019, though we can think of \u2018space\u2019\nwithout \u2018triangle\u2019. This is the first main role of the\nprinciple of determinability: it assists us in uncovering the main\ncategories of thought and their interrelations.\n\nThe other main role of the principle is to assist us in forming new\nconcepts (this is Maimon\u2019s attempt to have an ars\ninvendi ). Here again, the principle provides us only with a\nnegative criterion. If we ask ourselves: what are the possible\ndeterminations of \u2018line\u2019, the principle would not tell us\nthat \u2018straight\u2019 is such a determination. Only once we\nsuggest \u2018straight\u2019 as such a determination, could the\nprinciple evaluate \u2014 and in this case, approve \u2014 the\nrelation of \u2018straight\u2019 to \u2018line\u2019.\n\nMaimon\u2019s reliance on mathematical examples is not coincidental,\nsince it is (primarily) in mathematics that we find real syntheses,\nnamely, syntheses that pass the test of the law of determinability.\nThis special advantage of mathematics is due to the role of\nconstruction in mathematics. Thus, in the case of the straight line\nthe intellect commands a construction of a line in pure intuition\naccording to the concept of straight. In such a way, the connection\nbetween the subject and the predicate, while synthetic, is\nnevertheless necessary. (As Freudenthal (2006) notes, however, as\nMaimon\u2019s thought develops he becomes more skeptical that\nstraightness can be constructed according to the concept of a line, or\nthat a circle can be constructed from its concept. Since these stand\nat the heart of Euclidean geometry, Freudenthal argues that while\nMaimon holds that geometry is synthetic, he begins to doubt that it is\nabsolutely necessary, since it must rely on ineliminable intuitions\nrather than the understanding alone.) By contrast, a judgment such as\n\u201cThe cup is green\u201d fails to accord with the law of\ndeterminability, for the connection between the subject and the\npredicate remains merely problematic. For our intellect, the greenness\nof the cup is something that is merely encountered, rather than\nconsciously constructed, and thus it fails to express any internal\nconnection between the subject and its predicate. By using the Law of\nDeterminability Maimon thought to provide a way both to generate new\nconcepts as well as to decipher the basic categories of thought.\nMathematics provides us with an example of how these derivations\nshould work. However, this law also seems to point out the\nunreliability of empirical judgments.\n\nDeterminability then provides a standard of synthetic judgments: it\ntells us not merely the form that such judgments must take, but also\nspecifies what counts as a legitimate content of such a judgment. In\nthis sense, determinability provides a certain cohesion between the\nproducts of the mind. But while the Law of Determinability presents\nthe standard which real thought must meet, it is important to\nnote that Maimon remains dubious about the possibility of ever\nachieving real thought except in the realm of mathematics. Only when\nthe determinable relation between the subject and predicate of a\njudgment is constructed can real thought be reached; in\nempirical judgments about the world, no such determinable relation can\nbe proved. And it is just this concern that leads to Maimon\u2019s\nskepticism.\n\n5. From Dogmatism to Skepticism (and Back?)\n\nMaimon describes his position as \u201cHumean dogmatism,\u201d (or,\nalternately, as \u201cLeibnizian skepticism\u201d), and this\ncharacterization is apt \u2013 he is both a rational dogmatist and an\nempirical skeptic. His commitment to both camps, however, makes the\nquestion of his ultimate allegiance a difficult one. While Maimon\nagrees with the rationalists about the standards provided by reason,\nhe claims to follow Hume in denying that there can ever be a proof of\nthe applicability of reason to the world of experience. In this\nrespect, the status of the principle of determinability encapsulates\nMaimon\u2019s position: while we can comprehend what the standard of\nreal thought involves (since we have an example in mathematics), we\ncan never be sure about its application to empirical matters (since we\ncannot guarantee the requisite determinable relation between subject\nand predicate). Maimon\u2019s skepticism arises \u201cfrom the lack\nof the required ground for this use [of the categories], namely, the\ninsight into the relation of determinability (that the subject, as the\ndeterminable, can be an object of consciousness in itself, while the\npredicate cannot be so in itself, but only as a determination [of the\nsubject]). The categories are therefore, according to me, determined\nnot for empirical use, but only for the objects of mathematics\ndetermined a priori\u201d (GW V, 495\u20136 | VnL\n437\u20138).\n\nMaimon here exposes what seem to be the skeptical implications of his\nrationalism, for while the standards of real thought are available to\nus as finite cognizers, the satisfaction of these criteria remains\nbeyond our power. According to this skeptical rationalism, the\nconditions that allow us entry into the realm of reason can never be\nsatisfied in our relations to the sensible world: reason tells us what\nstandards our explanations must meet, but nothing in our experience\ncan discharge these demands. Rather, in our dealings with the sensible\nworld, we must remain Humean skeptics, who can appeal to regularities\nand customs in our attempts to explain the empirical world, but who\nrecognize that these explanations always remain provisional and\nunsure, since they never meet the demands of reason.\n\nBut while Maimon\u2019s skepticism commits him to the view that human\nknowledge remains incomplete, he does not abandon the notion of\nintellectual progress. While we can despair of ever reaching complete\nknowledge, the rationalist project at least holds out the hope of\nadvancing us in our conceptual grasp of the world (on this point, see\nChicharel 2020). In this sense, while Maimon is led by his skeptical\nconclusions to see human cognition as essentially antinomial, he\nretains the prospect of a solution:\n\nThought in general consists in a relation of a form (a rule of the\nunderstanding) to matter (the given subsumed by [the form]). Without\nmatter one cannot attain consciousness of the form, and consequently\nthe matter is a necessary condition of thought; that is, for the real\nthought of a form or rule of the understanding, there must necessarily\nbe given a matter to which this form relates. On the other hand,\nhowever, the completeness of the thought of an object requires that\nnothing be given in [this completeness], but rather that everything\nmust be thought. Since we cannot deny either of these demands, we must\ntherefore try to satisfy both, in that we make our thought ever more\ncomplete, whereby the matter always approaches the form, through\ninfinity \u2014 and this is the solution of this antinomy\n(GW III, 186\u20137 | PW 162\u20133).\n\n\nThis relation between skepticism and rationalism is nicely captured in\na biblical metaphor Maimon offers:\n\nReason, which in its theoretical employment is conditioned by given\nobjects, and is thus very limited, is now, in its practical use in\nrelation to the will, absolute. The principle which it presents is\nboth determined in itself, and in its application is capable of no\nillegitimacy. This highly pleasant prospect is certainly doubted by\nthe skeptic, who reduces any law, as an original fact, into many. An\nuplifting and at once humbling voice calls out to him: \u201cYou\nshould see the promised land from afar, but you may not enter\nit!\u201d [Deut 34:4] Still, fortunately the seeing and the entering\nare the same: for those who boast of being able to enter can, for\ntheir legitimation, do no more than show the distant view (GW\nVII, 554).\n\n\nThe vision of the promised land is an especially apt characterization\nof Maimon\u2019s skepticism: we can see what conditions would need to\nbe satisfied for real cognition, but we are barred from ever knowing\nif these conditions are met. When pressed for a warrant for his claims\nto certainty, the dogmatist can do no more than simply point to the\nfar-off land of philosophical milk and honey.\n6. Ethics\n\nUnlike Kant and most of the German Idealists, Maimon denies that\npractical reason enjoys a primacy over theoretical reason. For Maimon,\nthe force of both morality and epistemology resides in the notion of\nuniversal validity: as rational beings we are bound by both\nphilosophical truth and moral duty. As Maimon puts the matter,\n\u201cthe moral good is good only because it is true.\u201d\n(GW II, 405 | VT 409) And, in the 1794 essay \u201cAttempt\nat a New Presentation of the Principle of Morality and a New Deduction\nof its Reality,\u201d Maimon radically alters Kant\u2019s famous\nclaim in the Groundwork about the good will being the only\nunconditioned good, instead holding that \u201cit is impossible to\nthink of anything at all in the world, or indeed even beyond it, that\ncould be considered good without limitation except the striving\nafter cognition.\u201d (GW VI, 407; translated in Quinn\n(2018)) As such, the theoretical and the practical go hand in hand;\nfor Maimon, it makes no sense to follow Kant\u2019s claim to have\ndenied knowledge to make room for faith. Rather, Maimon revives\nsomething like the Aristotelian notion that the highest virtue and\npleasure are found in philosophical contemplation. This results,\nMaimon claims, because both practical and theoretical cognition follow\nfrom the same notion of freedom:\n\nJust as I have produced the principle of practical cognition from the\nmere widening of the theoretical, so I find practical freedom from the\nmere widening of what is theoretically given as a fact, and this\nconcept of freedom first makes possible the use of this principle\n(GW VII, 275 | KU 273).\n\n\nOur cognitive situations in the theoretical and moral arenas are then\nidentical; in each, the conflicts that characterize our cognitive\ncapacities can be resolved only by assuming that our cognition is a\n\u2018schema\u2019 of an infinite intellect, which is to embrace a\ntype of dogmatism that echoes Spinoza, Leibniz and Wolff.\n\nThe similarities between the theoretical and the practical realms\nallow for an explanation of the possibility of freedom, even though\n\u201cthis concept [of freedom] is capable of no empirical\npresentation.\u201d (GW VII 241 | KU 241) Thought, Maimon\nargues, is an absolutely free activity of the faculty of cognition,\nwhich is not determined a priori by natural laws, but rather\naccording to the laws of the faculty of cognition itself. The will\nthat is related to the faculty of cognition (the will to think) is\nlikewise not determined through objects of thought, but rather through\nthe a priori form of thought, which precedes the actual\nthought of these objects (on this point, see Ware (2019)). We thus\nhave an instance of a free will in general (GW VII 242 | KU\n240).\n\nAlthough Maimon\u2019s account of freedom is related to Kant\u2019s\nposition, Maimon diverges from the critical philosophy by insisting\nthat since the moral law provides only the form of the determination\nof the will, the actualization of this form \u201cmust be connected\nto an originally agreeable feeling (which does not arise from\nhabit).\u201d (GW VII 243 | KU 241) This feeling, Maimon argues, must\nbe understood not in terms of a particular sensuous desire, but rather\nas \u201cabstracted from all individuality.\u201d (GW VII\n245 | KU 243) Here the close connection between the theoretical and\nthe practical spheres is again important, for Maimon argues that the\n\u2018abstract feeling\u2019 is best understood in terms of a\n\u2018drive for cognition\u2019:\n\nMan considers himself as an object of nature, and consequently as a\nlimited being, and yet, since his faculty of cognition extends to all\npossible objects, he finds himself in a position to strive to\ninfinity, and to get ever closer to the infinite faculty of cognition\n(divinity). Can a greater worth for a being be thought than to get\ncloser to divinity? And must not all other motives vanish in the face\nof the motives of cognition and morality (whereby all lofty\npreferences extend to outer actions)? Here we have the prevailing\nmotive of morality, whose power no one who has considered the case can\ndoubt (GW VII 246\u20137 | KU 244\u20135).\n\n\nThe role played by the pleasure of the striving after knowledge,\nhowever, recedes in importance as Maimon becomes more skeptical about\nthe possibility of explaining the motivations that lead to moral\nactions. On this point, Pollock (2020) notes the similarities between\nMaimon\u2019s skeptical response to Kant\u2019 transcendental\nidealism and his moral philosophy: both fall prey to the worries that\narise from the quid juris and the quid facti.\nPerhaps the clearest formulation of Maimon\u2019s later position is\nin \u2018The Moral Skeptic,\u2019 a late work from 1800, where a\nsketch of the difference between moral dogmatism and skepticism is\nprovided. As in the theoretical realm, Maimon focuses on the problem\nof the legitimate application of universal rules to particular cases\n(a problem that Kant in the Groundwork is well aware of).\nJust as we can be skeptical of whether the category of causality is\nlegitimately applied to particular intuitions, so too can the\nconnection between the moral law and particular actions be called into\ndoubt. While the moral law presents the rule of conduct that I ought\nto follow, there is no way, Maimon claims, to determine whether in\nfact I act only according to it, or whether other motivations have\ninsinuated themselves into the action. Kant, of course, agrees with\nthis point, but Maimon attempts to draw a more skeptical conclusion\nfrom it than Kant does. On Maimon\u2019s view, one cannot determine\nwhether an action simply accords with the moral law \u201cand hence\npossesses mere legality\u201d or whether it in fact follows from the\nmotive of duty itself, and as such lays claim to morality. This\nuncertainty arises, Maimon argues, because the moral character of an\naction is not immediately present to cognition. Rather, one can\nascribe a moral character to a person or action only after excluding\nall other possible motives as insufficient to explain the action\n\u2014 but, Maimon notes, such a strategy would require an\n\u2018infinite faculty of cognition\u2019 in order to accomplish\nthis task. Given the uncertainty about motivations, Maimon argues that\nthe moral law can at best be viewed as an \u201cidea that provides\nonly a regulative use (for legality).\u201d (GW VII 547 | MS\n285) As such, while the moral law presents a universal command, it\ncannot be shown to be the ground of human actions, since \u2014 to\nemploy a term from Maimon\u2019s theoretical philosophy \u2014 there\nis no determinate relation between the moral law and particular\nactions. For Maimon, the moral law stands, as do the Kantian\ncategories in the theoretical realm, as a \u2018castle in the\nair,\u2019 incapable of reaching the solid ground of particular\nactions.\n7. Maimon\u2019s Influence on the Formation of German Idealism\n\nKant\u2019s high regard for Maimon was shared by a number of the\nimportant figures of the movements of German Enlightenment and\nIdealism. Mendelssohn, of course, had initially recognized the genius\nbeneath Maimon\u2019s coarse exterior, and Reinhold too took Maimon\nseriously, although their relation soured after Maimon published a\nvolume of their increasingly acrimonious correspondence without\nReinhold\u2019s permission. On a much more positive note, Fichte\nwrote that his admiration for Maimon\u2019s talent \u201c[k]nows no\nlimit,\u201d and he continues that \u201cMaimon has completely\noverturned the entire Kantian philosophy as it has been understood by\neveryone until now.\u201d (Gesamtausgabe III, 2: 275)\n\nAlthough Maimon\u2019s positive system was of interest to the German\nphilosophical community in the 1790s, his greatest influence was as a\nskeptic, and in particular as a critic of the \u2018cognitive\ndualism\u2019 that characterized Kant\u2019s critical philosophy.\nThe force of Maimon\u2019s objections to Kant was felt most directly\nby Fichte, who in the Wissenschaftslehre devotes considerable\nattention to Maimon\u2019s skeptical challenge to Kant. For Fichte,\nMaimon pointed out the fatal shortcomings of Kant\u2019s system, but\nfailed to move beyond a skepticism about the prospects for knowledge.\nThis is reflected in Fichte\u2019s claim that Maimon\u2019s position\n\u201cwould ground a skepticism that taught us to doubt our own\nexistence.\u201d (GA I, 2: 369) Fichte sought to remedy this\nsituation by developing a more thoroughgoing idealistic account of\nexperience, one which placed the notion of \u2018positing\u2019 at\nthe center of the system. Only in so doing, Fichte claims, can both\nKant\u2019s dualism and Maimon\u2019s skepticism be avoided.\n\nThe Wissenschaftslehre set the stage for the subsequent rise\nof Absolute Idealism, and its key commitments: the centrality of a\nproductive faculty of mind, as well as an embrace of a rationalist\nmethodology and a concomitant rejection of any type of dualism. In\nthis respect, the project of Absolute Idealism owes much to Maimon,\nwho himself had developed just these themes in his various works. But\nwhere Fichte \u2014 and Schelling and Hegel \u2014 stand as\noptimists about the prospects for this type of philosophical inquiry,\nMaimon remains much less sanguine about the ability of finite minds to\nreach a final \u2018System\u2019 of philosophy. It is perhaps\ntestament to the force of Maimon\u2019s skepticism that while the\nSystems of German Idealism have collapsed, the skeptical challenge\nMaimon poses for accounts of experience remains vital and forceful\n\u2014 if unduly neglected \u2014 today. Maimon, that is,\nanticipates key points of the contemporary debates about the nature of\nGivenness, and his skeptical position offers and interesting and novel\nperspective on discussions of the issue.\n\nMaimon also seems to have played an important role in the reception of\nSpinoza in German Idealism. Maimon was not only the first to try to\ncreate a synthesis between Kantian idealism and Spinozistic pantheism\n(GW III 455), but he was also apparently the first to suggest\nthat Spinoza\u2019s philosophy was not atheistic, but rather a strong\nthough unorthodox religious view. Instead of characterizing\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy as atheism, a view which denies Gods\nexistence, Maimon argues that it should rather be called acosmism,\ninsofar as it denies the reality of the diverse world and affirms the\nsole reality of God. This characterization of Spinoza was later\nadopted by Hegel (See Hegel\u2019s Encyclopedia Logic,\nsections 50 and 151, and his discussion of Spinoza in the Lectures\non the History of Philosophy) and seems to play a central role in\nHegel\u2019s perception of Spinoza.\n8. Jewish Philosophy and Culture\n\nBeing raised in an East-European Jewish surrounding, Maimon\u2019s\nthought was influenced by the major intellectual movements of this\narena. Talmud, Kabbalah, contemporary Hassidism and\nmedieval Jewish philosophy played a crucial role in the formation of\nMaimon\u2019s philosophy as well as the style of his writings. The\nstrongest influence was that of Maimonides, whose unbiased and strict\nrationalism Maimon took as a guiding example throughout his life (even\nwhen he no longer adhered to Maimonidean metaphysics). Following\nMaimonides, Maimon held intellectual perfection as the ultimate human\nend, and saw moral perfection merely as means for achieving this end.\nLike Maimonides, Maimon argued that God\u2019s image in humanity is\nthe intellect and that to the extent that we activate and develop our\nintellectual capacities we become closer and more similar to God.\n\nMaimon\u2019s relation to the Kabbalah was a bit more\nambivalent. While he had no sympathy for the anthropomorphic teachings\nof some of the major Kabbalistic works, Maimon attempted to disclose\nthe rationalistic core of the Kabbalah, which he identified\nwith Spinoza\u2019s pantheistic teachings. In his early Hebrew\nwritings Maimon develops the view that God is also the material\ncause of the world (i.e., that all things are merely predicates\nof God, who is their substratum). Since Maimon conceives God to be a\npure intellect, the result is a genuine form of radical \u2014 and\npantheistic \u2014 idealism. This form of idealism plays a\nsignificant role in Maimon\u2019s thought in the 1790s, and possibly\nalso in the development of German Idealism in general.\n\nMaimon also seems to borrow from Kabbalistic and contemporary Hassidic\nwritings the idea of an infinite process through which one\n\u201cstrives to turn matter into form,\u201d though he will\ninterpret this formula in metaphysical rather than ethical terms.\n\nIn his early Hebrew writings Maimon expresses a deep interest and\ncuriosity about astrology and magic, an interest that he returns to as\na contributor and editor of the Magazin zur\nErfahrungsseelenkunde.\n\nAfter his migration from Lithuania to Germany, Maimon entered the\ncircles of the Haskala (the Jewish Enlightenment movement) in\nBerlin. Maimon shared with this circle the idea that there is a need\nto propagate the enlightenment and scientific education among\ntraditional Jews; yet, he seemed to have a very different\nunderstanding of what Enlightenment is. While for the Berlin\nHaskala, \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 was primarily the\nattempt to acculturate the Jewish masses in order to allow their\nacceptance into modern German society, Maimon\u2019s idea of\nEnlightenment was that of propagating science and philosophy. This\nunderstanding of Enlightenment was deeply imbedded in Maimon\u2019s\ninheritance of Maimonidean philosophy, which took philosophy and the\nsciences to be the highest stages of religious work, through which one\ncomes to know God in the deepest sense. This attitude is clearly\ndemonstrated in Maimon\u2019s 1791 commentary on the Guide of the\nPerplexed \u2014 Giva\u2019ath ha-Moreh (Hebrew: The\nHill of the Guide). In this work Maimon frequently interprets the\nclaims of Maimonides according to 18th century science and philosophy\n(especially Kant). While this form of intentional anachronism reveals\nMaimon\u2019s view of philosophy as a perennial discourse, it was\nalso designed to serve the propagation of modern science and thought\namong its readers (Maimon himself explains in a similar way\nMaimonides\u2019 decision to open his legal codex, the Mishne\nTorah, with a summary of Aristotelian first philosophy).\n\nLike other members of the Jewish enlightenment, Maimon criticized\ntraditional Jewish society, and primarily the Talmudists, for their\nprejudices and idleness. Yet, along with this straightforward\ncriticism, Maimon also expressed a deep appreciation for the\nsharpness, devotion and moral character of the Talmudists. In his\nAutobiography, Maimon writes that he \u201cwould have to\nwrite a book, had I wished to answer all the unjust charges and\nridicule brought against the Talmud by both Christian authors as well\nas wishing-to-be-enlightened Jews.\u201d (GW I 172 | LB I 172). Here\nMaimon gives a detailed picture of various streams and aspects of the\nJewish culture. In most cases his account is a masterpiece of a\nthoughtful, thoroughly informed, and unbiased exploration of\none\u2019s own culture.\n\nMaimon\u2019s reception by both traditional and enlightened Jews was\nquite poor. In a few texts Maimon was lumped together with Spinoza and\nAcosta to form \u201cthe great chain of Jewish heretics,\u201d but\nmostly Maimon\u2019s writings and philosophy were ignored. The\ntraditional community could not forgive him his infidelity and his\ndesertion of their ranks (A certain literary source tells us that in\nMaimon\u2019s funeral the children of the nearby Jewish community of\nGlogau ran after his coffin and threw stones on it. Maimon\u2019s\ncorpse was buried at the margin of the Jewish cemetery in Glogau. When\nMaimon\u2019s friend, Graf Kalkreuth, asked why he was treated with\nsuch disrespect, he was told that \u201cthe edge of the cemetery is\nan honorary place designated traditionally for philosophers and their\nlike\u201d). For the enlightened Jews of Germany, Maimon was too much\nof an Ostjude and had too much sympathy for and similarity to\nthe Talmudists. Furthermore, Maimon never took part in the attempt to\ndefine the \u201cessence\u201d of Judaism and by this to provide a\ntheology that would imitate and be able to compete with modern\nProtestant theology. Being thoroughly knowledgeable about the variety\nof aspects and streams of Judaism, Maimon simply could not\nparticipate in this reductive project which unfortunately was quite\ncentral to modern Jewish philosophy. Thus, in spite of the fact that\nMaimon\u2019s erudition in Jewish literature was hardly equaled by\nany other modern Jewish thinker, Maimon\u2019s name is\nomitted in many, if not most, 20th century surveys of\nmodern Jewish philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Original editions of Maimon\u2019s main Works", "Modern Editions and Translations of Maimon\u2019s Works", "Unpublished Manuscripts", "Missing Manuscripts", "Selected Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Original editions of Maimon\u2019s main Works": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Versuch \u00fcber die Transcendentalphilosophie</em>\n[<strong>VT</strong>], Berlin: Christian Friedrich Voss und Sohn,\n1790.", "<em>Gibeath Hamore</em> (<em>The Hill of the Guide</em>), Berlin:\n1791.", "<em>Philosophisches W\u00f6rterbuch, oder Beleuchtung der\nwichtigsten Gegenst\u00e4nde der Philosophie, in alphabetischer\nOrdnung</em> [<strong>PW</strong>], Berlin: Johann Friedrich Unger,\n1791.", "<em>Salomon Maimon\u2018s Lebensgeschichte.

After his death, Maimon\u2019s patron, Graf\nAdolf Kalkreuth, gave the manuscripts to Benjamin Fraenkel from the\nnearby Jewish community in Glogau. During the 19th century\nMaimon\u2019s manuscripts and letters were dispersed and held by\nseveral prominent Jewish scholars and bibliophiles such as Abraham\nGeiger, Leopold Zunz and Heimann Michael. The collection of the latter\n\u2014 which included Maimon\u2019s <em>Ta\u2019alumoth Hochma</em>\n\u2014 was purchased by the Bodleian library in 1848. Several other\nmanuscripts found different ways to the collection of the Berlin\n<em>Hochschule f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft des Judentums</em> where they\nwere held till World War II. Before and during the war the\n<em>Hochschule</em>\u2019s collection was smuggled out of Germany.\nThe most important Maimonian MS held by the <em>Hochschule</em>\narrived, in the 1980s, at the National and University Library in\nJerusalem.
