    "main_text": "\n\nIn the philosophy of mind, externalism is the view that what\nis going on in an individual\u2019s mind is not (entirely) determined\nby what is going on inside her body, including her brain. Externalism\ncomes in two principal forms: externalism about mental\ncontent and externalism about the vehicles or bearers of that\ncontent. The latter form of externalism is commonly known as the extended mind. At stake are important issues concerning the nature of the\nmind and its relation to the world, both natural and social.\n",
