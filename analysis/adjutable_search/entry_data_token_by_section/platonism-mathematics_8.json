    "main_text": "The Fregean Argument for Existence || Defending Classical Semantics\n2.2 Defending Classical Semantics\n\nClassical Semantics claims that the language of\nmathematics functions semantically much like language in general\nfunctions (or at least has traditionally been assumed to function):\nthe semantic functions of singular terms and quantifiers are to refer\nto objects and to range over objects, respectively. This is a broadly\nempirical claim about the workings of a semi-formal language used by\nthe community of professional mathematicians. (In the widely adopted\nterminology of Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 6\u20137,\nClassical Semantics is a hermeneutic claim;\nthat is, it is a descriptive claim about how a certain language is\nactually used, not a normative claim about how this language ought to\nbe used.) Note also that Classical Semantics is\ncompatible with most traditional views on semantics; in particular, it\nis compatible with all the standard views on the meanings of\nsentences, namely that they are truth-values, propositions, or sets of\npossible worlds.\n\nClassical Semantics enjoys strong prima\nfacie plausibility. For the language of mathematics strongly\nappears to have the same semantic structure as ordinary\nnon-mathematical language. As Burgess (1999) observes, the following\ntwo sentences appear to have the same simple semantic structure of a\npredicate being ascribed to a subject (p. 288):\n\nEvelyn is prim.\nEleven is prime.\n\n\nThis appearance is also borne out by the standard semantic analyses\nproposed by linguists and semanticists.\n\nClassical Semantics has nevertheless been challenged,\nfor instance by nominalists such as Hellman (1989) and by Hofweber\n(2005 and 2016). (See also Moltmann (2013) for some challenges\nconcerned with arithmetical vocabulary in natural language, as well as\nSnyder (2017) for discussion.) This is not the place for an extended\ndiscussion of such challenges. Let me just note that a lot of work is\nneeded to substantiate this sort of challenge. The challenger will\nhave to argue that the apparent semantic similarities between\nmathematical and non-mathematical language are deceptive. And these\narguments will have to be of the sort that linguists and\nsemanticists\u2014with no vested interest in the philosophy of\nmathematics\u2014could come to recognize as\n significant.[11]\n",
