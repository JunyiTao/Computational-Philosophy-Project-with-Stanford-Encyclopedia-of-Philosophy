    "main_text": "Complexity of the Question\n3. Complexity of the Question\n\nIt is said that philosophy begins in wonder. Thus it was for the\npre-Socratic Greeks, who wondered what constituted the basic stuff of\nthe world (\u03ba\u00f3\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) around them,\nhow this basic stuff changed into the diverse forms they experienced,\nand how it came to be. These origination questions related to the\npuzzle of existence that, in its metaphysical dimensions, is the\nsubject of our concern.\n\nFirst, why is there anything at all? This question becomes clearer\nwhen put in contrastive form, Why is there something rather than\nnothing? We can ask this question even in the absence of contingent\nbeings, though in this context it is likely to prove unanswerable. For\nexample, if God or the universe is logically or absolutely necessary,\nit would not only exist but must exist even if nothing else existed.\nProbably no reason can be given for why logically or absolutely\nnecessary things exist, if they do at all. (Almeida disagrees; see his\nargument below.)\n\nSome doubt whether we can ask this question because there being\nnothing is not an option. John Heil asks, \u201cWhat exactly is\nnothing at all? What would nothing be?\u201d (Heil\n2013: 174). He analogizes nothing with the notion of empty space, in\nterms of which, he thinks, we can conceptualize nothing. He reasons\nthat we cannot achieve a notion of empty space simply by removing the\nuniverse\u2019s contents one at a time, for space (the void) would\nstill exist. However, we need not analogize nothing in terms of empty\nspace, and even if we do, we surely can conceive of removing space. If\nwe think of space as a particular type of relation between objects,\nthe removal of all objects (everything) would leave nothing, including\nrelations. The key point is that \u201cleaving nothing\u201d is not\nto be understood in the sense that nothing is or has existence. We can\neasily be misled by the language of there being nothing at\nall, leading to the notion that nothing has being or existence. Heil\nsuggests that nothing might be a precursor to the Big Bang. However,\nthis too is a misconception\u2014though one widely held by those who\nthink that the universe arose out of nothing, e.g., a vacuum\nfluctuation. A vacuum fluctuation is itself not nothing \u201cbut is\na sea of fluctuating energy endowed with a rich structure and subject\nto physical laws\u201d (Craig and Sinclair 2009: 183, 191). The\ncontrastive question is comprehensible: \u201cWhy is there something\nrather than there never having been anything whatsoever?\u201d\n\nRutten (2012, 13\u201315, see Other Internet Resources) develops an\na priori reductio ad absurdum argument for the\nimpossibility of there being nothing. Suppose nothing exists. If\nnothing exists, then no actual states of affairs exist, and if no\nactual states of affairs exist, no merely possible states of affairs\nexist, since (on an Aristotelean model) there is nothing to actualize\nthem or bring them about. Hence, if nothing exists, there are no\npossible states of affairs, since to be possible, something must\neither be actual or merely possible. (This is consistent with the\ntheists\u2019 contention that out of nothing nothing can come.)\nHowever, one can conceive of a possible world with at least one actual\nand hence possible state of affairs S, for example, a world\nwith one atom. But, Rutten notes, on the S5 axiom system of modal\nlogic (see the entry on\n modal logic),\n all possible worlds are connected. Hence, if S is\nmetaphysically possible in one world, S is metaphysically\npossible in all possible worlds. That is, S is necessarily\npossible. However, this contradicts the original conclusion that if\ntotal nothingness is metaphysically possible, there are no possible\nstates of affairs in that possible world. Hence, there is a\nreductio against the original thesis that there can be\nnothingness. One might counter this reductio not only by questioning\nthe principle that what is metaphysically possible in one world is so\nin every world, but also by contending that the argument trades on a\nconfusion between metaphysical necessity, as evidenced by appeal to an\nAristotelian principle regarding the relationship between actuality\nand possibility, with logical necessity, which in invoking the S5\nmodal system addresses logical possibility across possible worlds (for\nthis distinction, see Burgess 1999, 81). \n\nSecond, why are there these particular contingent beings? The\nstarting point here is the existence of particular things, and the\nquestion posed asks for an explanation for there being these\nparticular things. If we are looking for a causal explanation and\naccept a full explanation (in terms of contemporary or\nimmediately prior causal conditions and the relevant natural laws that\ntogether necessitate the effect), the answer emerges from an analysis\nof the relevant immediate causal conditions present in each case. Hume\nargues that an explanation in terms of temporally conjoined factors is\nall that is necessary for a satisfactory explanation. In contrast,\nO\u2019Connor treats this formulation of the question as the basis\nfor his construction of a cosmological argument for the existence of\nan absolutely necessary being (2008: 65). \n\nHeil suggests that the answer depends on how one understands the Big\nBang (2013: 178). If it was spontaneous, the question has no answer.\nIf not spontaneous, there might be an answer. Theists broaden the\nexplanatory search to include final causes or intentions appropriate\nto a personal cause. It leads us to ask the question, \u201cSupposing\nthat God exists, why did God bring about contingent beings?\u201d\nThis assumes that God exists and now inquires about the reasons for\ncreation. On the one hand, we might argue that this question is\nunanswerable in that only God would know his reasons for bringing the\nuniverse into existence (O\u2019Connor 2008). On the other hand, God\nacts out of his nature; Swinburne (2004: 47, 114\u201323) emphasizes\nGod\u2019s goodness, from which we can infer possible reasons for\nwhat God brings about (although at this point the problem of evil has\nbite). God also acts from his intentions (Swinburne 1993:\n139\u201345; 2007: 83\u201384), so that God could reveal his\npurposes for his act of creating (Richard Swinburne, The Evolution\nof the Soul: 309).\n\nThird, why do things continue to exist? This is the question that\nThomas Aquinas posed. Aquinas was interested not in a beginning cause\nbut in a sustaining cause, for he believed that the universe could be\neternal\u2014although he believed on the basis of revelation that it\nwas not eternal. He constructed his cosmological arguments around the\nquestion of what sustains things in the universe in their\nexistence.\n\nFourth, if the universe has a beginning, what is the cause of that\nbeginning? This is the question that is addressed by the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument, given its central premise\nthat everything that begins to exist has a cause. Many, however, deny\nthe antecedent in the conditional, that the universe had a\nbeginning.\n\nFifth and fundamentally, why are there contingent beings? This may be\nasked about particular finite beings and, if the universe is\ncontingent, the universe. Several responses have been given. One is\nthat particular things exist because of their causes, and their causes\nbecause of their causes, and so on. Had those causes not existed, the\neffect in question would not exist. If one speaks about the universe,\nthen either it exists because it is caused (e.g., brought about by the\nintentional act of a supernatural being) or it is inexplicable (the\nuniverse just exists; its existence is a brute fact; it has always\nexisted, though perhaps through many phases). This is the question\nthat traditional cosmological arguments connected to natural theology\naddress.\n\nTwo things should be obvious from this discussion. First, questions\nabout existence are more nuanced than usually addressed (Heil 2013:\n177). It is important to be more precise about what one is asking when\none asks this broader metaphysical question about why there is\nsomething rather than nothing. Second, the cosmological argument lies\nat the heart of attempts to answer the questions, and to this we now\nturn.\n",
