    "main_text": "Social Contexts of Practitioners\n7. The Early Science(s)\n\n\nI conclude with a brief account of areas of relation between Chinese\nphilosophy and the Chinese sciences, remembering that Chinese accounts\nfocused on specific sciences, rather than on one unified notion of\nscience. We find these primarily in the qualitative sciences of \nastronomy and astrology and medicine.\n\nAn important area of overlap between philosophy and science occurred\nin cosmology, mathematics and calendrics. An important aspect of\ncosmological interest is observational astronomy or astrology (tian\nwen). In an important recent study of Chinese\narchaeo-astronomy, David Pankenier (2013, 5) traces the Chinese\ncoordination of human activities with the observation and positions of\nthe sun, moon, and stars as far back as the Neolithic cultures of the\nfifth millennium BCE. Written evidence of royal interest in stars\nand winds clearly dates back to the Shang oracle bone inscriptions. As\nNathan Sivin (1990, 181) puts it: \u201cThe difference between\nastronomy and astrology was a contrast of emphasis on the quantitative\nas opposed to the qualitative and on objective motions as opposed to\nthe correlation between celestial and political events.\u201d\n\nThese areas have only slight links to philosophy. Astronomical\nand astrological observation was an important part of court ritual,\nsince they were used to determine auspicious times for a wide variety\nof events. It could be said that textualists approved of them as\nan aspect of the conduct of ritual, but there was little philosophical\nengagement with their details. (There are also slight but\nimportant connections between philosophy and mathematics. This question\nhas been in many ways obscured by focus on the idea of mathematical or\nlogical proof and its presence or absence in China (Chemla 2012, Chemla\nand Guo 2004).\n\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, questions about the nature of the heavens\nwere pursued by the fang shi (discussed in section 2). Fang\nexpertise also included divination by the heavens, both by the stars,\nand by interpreting sub-celestial phenomena, including weather, clouds,\nmists, and winds (Ngo 1976, Li Ling 1993).\n\n\nThese activities were not invented by the fang shi. The\nHan shu Bibliographic Treatise also provides evidence of\nfang activity through the titles of lost books. Other evidence\ncomes from late Warring States and Han texts such as the L\u00fc\nShi chunqiu and Huainanzi. The Huainanzi\ncontains several chapters of astronomical interest (Major 1993). One\npassage describes the technical interests of the sage emperor Yu, who\nordered his officials to measure the distances to the ends of the earth\nby pacing the distance to the eastern, western, northern and southern\nextremities of the earth (Huainanzi 4, 56). The exact\nnumbers given are problematic to say the least, but the point is that\nthe sage rulers of antiquity, in legendary accounts, interested\nthemselves in the physical observation of the earth.\n\n\nThe third chapter of the Huainanzi ends with a section on\nthe use of the measurements cast by shadows (gnomons) to calculate\ndistances. This passage is probably a later addition, but for our\npurposes, its inclusion in the Huainanzi is indicative of the\nscientific concerns of the text. It gives directions for a series of\nmeasurements, including how to determine the directions of sunrise,\nsunset, and the cardinal directions. It also explains how to measure\nthe \u201cbreadth and length of east, west, north, and\nsouth\u201d:\n\nIf you wish to know the figures for the breadth and length of east,\nwest, north, and south set up four gnomons to make a right-angled\nfigure one li square. More than ten days before the spring or autumn\nequinox sight along the northern gnomons of the square on the sun from\nits first appearance to its rise above the horizon. Wait for [the day\nwhen] they coincide. When they coincide they are in line with the sun.\nEach time take a sight on it [the sun] with the southern gnomons, and\ntake the amount by which it is within the forward gnomons as the\ndivisor. Divide the whole width and divide the length [between] the\nstanding gnomons in order to know the measurements east and west from\nhere (Huainanzi 3, 53\u201354, translation after Cullen 1976,\n116).\n\nAnother area of potential Ru interest in astronomy is calendrics,\nbased on detailed observation of seasonal changes. One example is the\nMonthly Ordinance (Yueling \u6708\u4ee4) calendars of the\nHuainanzi. Monthly Ordinances use Five Agents correlations to\nspecify the correct social, ritual, and agricultural activities for\neach season. Rulers could use these texts to regulate state ritual\nactivities over the course of the year. The ordinances cover such\ntopics as state activities (fortification, planting, etc.) and the\nconsequences of performing activities at incorrect times. These are the\nfirst texts in the received tradition to link the twenty-eight Lunar\nLodges to the months of the year, associating each month with a lodge,\nwhich indicates the position of the sun among the stars for that month.\n(Ancient Chinese astronomers divided the celestial equator around the\npole star into twenty-eight \u201clodges\u201d (xiu\n\u5bbf), each named by a star within it and each comprising some 13\ndegrees (du \u5ea6) of the circle.) The calendric tables\nlist the days of the year in stem-branch sexagenary order, with\nannotations on the nature of different kinds of days, and which days\nwere auspicious or inauspicious for particular activities. (Such\ncalendars also appear in almost identical form in the Guanzi\nand L\u00fc Shi chunqiu, and were incorporated into\nthe Li ji in the Later Han dynasty. See Guanzi, chs.\n3.8 and 3.9, Rickett 1985, 148\u2013192) They also included monthly and\nseasonal correlates. For example, the lodges were associated with the\nposition of the sun, and dusk and dawn correlated to the five\npentatonic tones, pitch pipe notes, numbers, tastes, smells, color of\nthe emperor\u2019s clothing, presiding deity, and yin and yang\nsacrificial organs, all described in terms of the Five Agents (Major\n1993, 220\u2013225).\n\n\nIt is almost impossible to separate Chinese ideas of body, state,\ncosmos and \u201cnature.\u201d Nathan Sivin (1995, 3n1) points out\nthat there is no indigenous term for \u201cnature\u201d in China\nbefore the nineteenth century. Over the course of the last three\ncenturies BCE, Chinese understandings of the physical world developed\nto reflect, and mirror, political consolidation (Sivin 1995). These new\nideas of cosmic order\u2014correspondence between microcosm (the body)\nand macrocosm (the cosmos)\u2014appeared in new representations of the\nbody, the state, and the cosmos that were based on systematic\napplications and correlations of the ideas of yin and yang and of the\nFive Agents (wuxing). They appear in medical texts such as the\nHuang Di neijing, in calendrics, in observational astronomy\nand the study of astronomical portents with political implications, and\nin the \u201ccorrelative cosmologies\u201d of many Han dynasty texts\n(Lloyd 1996, Lloyd and Sivin 2002).\n\n\nAnother important area of engagement between philosophy and medicine\nwas in the theory and practice of \u201cnurturing life\u201d\n(yang sheng \u990a\u751f). Fang shi medical\npractices and ideas included \u201crecipes\u201d for \u201cNurturing\nLife.\u201d This broad category included a wide range of\nself-cultivation techniques.\n\nReferences to yang sheng techniques appear in both accounts\nof self-cultivation in Masters texts and in the titles of (lost)\nrecipes in the Han shu Bibliographic Treatise. Mark\nCsikzentmihalyi has argued that \u201cmaterial virtue\u201d\ntraditions drawing on yang sheng techniques appear prominently\nin the Mencius and in two versions of the Wu xing\n\u4e94\u884c or \u201cFive Kinds of Action\u201d recovered from\nGuodian and Mawangdui. These texts provide \u201ca detailed moral\npsychology describing the process of the cultivation of the\nvirtues\u201d (Csikszentmihalyi 2004, 7). Mencius (2A2) famously\nrefers to \u201ccultivating flood-like qi\u201d and the third chapter\nof the Zhuangzi is titled \u201cThe Lord of Nurturing\nLife\u201d (Yang sheng zhu). By contrast, references to\nyang sheng in popular culture and in the recipes in the\n\u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d section of the Treatise seem directly\nconcerned with health and longevity (V. Lo 2001 and 2005, Raphals\n2008\u20132009).\n\nYin-yang, qi and the Five Agents also informed\nmedical theories, which were systematized in a cosmological framework\nin the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine or Huang\nDi neijing (Veith 1972, Unschuld and Tessenow 2011). This complex\nand multi-layered text, probably compiled in the first century BCE,\npresents a systematic cosmology that analogizes the body, the state,\nand the cosmos in complex systems of \u201ccorrelative\ncosmology\u201d (Graham 1986; Sivin 1995; Lloyd and Sivin 2002). For\nexample, the Huang Di neijing describes correspondence between\nthe articulations of the body and the cosmos, specifically between\nheaven and earth and the upper and lower parts of the body, including\nrelations and analogies between body, state and the cosmos, all\nexpressed in terms of yin-yang and the Five Agents (Huang Di\nneijing lingshu, 71.2, 446). Such correlations seem a far\ncry from either cosmological speculation or empirical science in any\nmodern sense. Between those extremes stand the mostly lost arts of\ntechnical traditions described in the Han shu Bibliographic\nTreatise: astronomy, medical, pharmacological, and mantic arts, whose\npractitioners were the counterparts and potential competitors of the\nMasters textualists or philosophers (Lloyd and Sivin 2002). Expertise\ninitially developed by diviners and technical specialists became part\nof the Daode jing, Zhuangzi, and Huainanzi.\nIt was also incorporated into the systematic cosmology and medicine of\nthe Han (Lloyd 1996, Lloyd and Sivin 2002). The Huang Di\nneijing is listed (and first appears) in the Recipes and Methods\nsection of the Han shu Bibliographic Treatise under the\nheading of Medical Classics (Han shu 30, 1776).\n\n\nA particular problem raised by the application of yin-yang theory to\nmedicine was the implications of yin-yang theories for accounts of\ngender (Furth 1986, Raphals 1998, Yates 2005), including the problem of\nthe androgyny of what Charlotte Furth calls \u201cthe Yellow\nEmperor\u2019s body.\u201d Furth argues that the human body is\nunderstood as androgynous before the development of gynecology in the\nSong dynasty. These models of the body inform the early history of\nyin-yang theory, and the gender analogies that form part of\nthat discourse. A central text to these analogies is the\nHuang Di neijing, which is striking for its overall\nandrogyny. Overall, women are not specified as medically distinct\nfrom men, and where they do occur, discussions of sexual difference are\nusually linked to specific questions of fertility and reproduction\n(e.g., Huang Di neijing suwen 1.3.8 and 7.2.26).\n\n\nOf more interest for a consideration of science and philosophy are a\ngroup of analogies in medical and philosophical texts between yin and\nyang and male and female. They describe the conditions of men and women\nby analogy with yin and yang, heaven and earth, and\nsometimes right and left. For example, the statement that women and men\nhave opposite pulse patterns: \u201cIn women the right [pulse]\nmanifests opposition, the left manifests obedience; in men the left\n[pulse] manifests opposition, the right manifests obedience\u201d\n(Huang Di neijing suwen, 15.2.45).\n\n\nTheories of yin-yang, qi and Five Agents were applied to the\ndiagnosis and treatment of disease, using techniques such as acumoxa\nand herbal medicine. These theories were also applied to\nlongevity practices designed to extend health and life and in some\ncases to produce literal, physical immortality.\n\n\nAnother very important area of overlap between philosophy and\nmedicine is the significant number of important explicitly Daoist\nthinkers who were also practicing physicians and authors of important\nmedical texts. (For more information on all these topics, see the\nentry \u201cChinese Medicine and Chinese Philosophy\u201d.)\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, this brief account addresses important issues in the\ncomplex relations between philosophy and the early history of science\nin China, especially as they informed the qualitative sciences of\nmedicine and astronomy, and their relations with early Chinese\nphilosophy overall. It shows that the harsh assessment of Chinese\nphilosophy quoted at the beginning of this essay over-simplifies\nseveral complex questions. The work of Joseph Needham, Nathan Sivin and\nothers demonstrates that Chinese philosophy is not inherently\n\u201canti-science.\u201d But it could be argued \u2013 and\npersuasively in the view of this author \u2013 that the priorities\nassociated with the vexed term \u201cConfucianism\u201d have often\n(though not always) steered Chinese philosophy away from scientific\nconcerns. A second question raised here is whether Chinese philosophy\ncontributes to science in ways that constitute a culturally specific\n\u201cChinese science\u201d that is different from modern science.\nThis point remains a locus of strong disagreement among historians of\nscience in China.\n",
