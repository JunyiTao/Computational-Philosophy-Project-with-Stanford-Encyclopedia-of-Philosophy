I like spicy food, so every year I plant hot\npeppers. I plant a variety of hot peppers\u2014differences in size,\nheat-level, place of origin, etc. And suppose that each year I notice\nthat my hot peppers only begin flowering in late summer, early\nfall\u2014never early spring. I might reason as follows:\n\nNo-Known-Pepper (NKP)\n\nNo hot pepper I know of flowers in early spring.\n\nNone-at-all-Pepper (NaaP)\n\nTherefore, no hot pepper at all flowers in early spring.\n\nThe reasoning in this case is inductive. I have a sample\nsize\u2014hot peppers I know of\u2014and they have a certain\nproperty\u2014they don\u2019t flower in early spring. I infer from\nthis sample size to a larger group\u2014all hot peppers\u2014that\nthey have the same property. Since my sample size is representative of\nthe larger group, this inductive inference is a reasonable one.\n\nAnalogously, suppose we consider whether we know of any outweighing\ngoods that would justify God\u2019s permission of the girl\u2019s\nsuffering and the fawn\u2019s suffering. We are familiar with a\nvariety of outweighing goods in life. Suppose we think that none of\nthe outweighing goods we know of would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the girl\u2019s suffering and the fawn\u2019s suffering. We might\nreason inductively as follows (compare Rowe (1988, 1991):\n\nNo-Known-Goods (NKG)\n\nNo outweighing goods we know of would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering\n\nNone-at-all-Goods (NaaG)\n\nTherefore, no outweighing goods at all would justify God\u2019s\npermission of the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s\nsuffering.\n\nFrom NaaG it is a short-step to\nN-O1.2 and then atheism. This way of\ndefending N-O1.2 avoids noseeum inferences\nand so might be thought to side-step the CORNEA-based criticisms of\nthe previous section.\n",
