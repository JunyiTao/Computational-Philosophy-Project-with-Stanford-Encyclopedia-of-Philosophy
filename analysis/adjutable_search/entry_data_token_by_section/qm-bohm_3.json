    "main_text": "The Defining Equations of Bohmian Mechanics\n4. The Defining Equations of Bohmian Mechanics\n\nIn Bohmian mechanics the wave function, obeying\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, does not provide a complete\ndescription or representation of a quantum system. Rather, it governs\nthe motion of the fundamental variables, the positions of the\nparticles: In the Bohmian mechanical version of nonrelativistic\nquantum theory, quantum mechanics is fundamentally about the behavior\nof particles; the particles are described by their positions, and\nBohmian mechanics prescribes how these change with time. In this\nsense, for Bohmian mechanics the particles are primary, or primitive,\nwhile the wave function is secondary, or derivative. (Bohmian\nmechanics, like classical mechanics, is thus a theory grounded in\na primitive ontology, for Bohmian mechanics one of particles\ndescribed by their positions. This terminology was introduced in\nD\u00fcrr et al. 1992a. For more on the notion of primitive ontology,\nsee Allori et al. 2008 and Allori 2015.)\n\nWarning: It is the positions of the particles in Bohmian mechanics\nthat are its \u201chidden variables\u201d, an unfortunate bit of\nterminology. As Bell writes, referring to Bohmian mechanics and\nsimilar theories,\n\n\nAbsurdly, such theories are known as \u201chidden variable\u201d\ntheories. Absurdly, for there it is not in the wavefunction that one\nfinds an image of the visible world, and the results of experiments,\nbut in the complementary \u201chidden\u201d(!) variables. Of course\nthe extra variables are not confined to the visible\n\u201cmacroscopic\u201d scale. For no sharp definition of such a\nscale could be made. The \u201cmicroscopic\u201d aspect of the\ncomplementary variables is indeed hidden from us. But to admit things\nnot visible to the gross creatures that we are is, in my opinion, to\nshow a decent humility, and not just a lamentable addiction to\nmetaphysics. In any case, the most hidden of all variables, in the\npilot wave picture, is the wavefunction, which manifests itself to us\nonly by its influence on the complementary variables. (1987a,\nreprinted 1987c: 201\u2013202) \n\n\nBohmian mechanics is the minimal completion of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, for a nonrelativistic system of\nparticles, to a theory describing a genuine motion of particles. For\nBohmian mechanics the state of a system of \\(N\\) particles is\ndescribed by its wave function \\(\\psi = \\psi(\\boldsymbol{q}_1 ,\\ldots\n,\\boldsymbol{q}_N) = \\psi(q)\\), a complex (or spinor-valued) function\non the space of possible configurations \\(q\\) of the system, together\nwith its actual configuration \\(Q\\) defined by the actual positions\n\\(\\mathbf{Q}_1 ,\\ldots ,\\mathbf{Q}_N\\) of its particles. (The word\n\u201cspinor\u201d refers to a suitable array of complex numbers in\nplace of a single one. Spinor-valued wave functions are used in\nquantum mechanics to describe electrons and other quantum particles\nthat \u201chave spin\u201d.) The theory is then defined by two\nevolution equations: Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation \n\n\\[\ni\\hslash\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = H\\psi\n\\]\n\n for\n\\(\\psi(t)\\), where \\(H\\) is the nonrelativistic (Schr\u00f6dinger)\nHamiltonian, containing the masses of the particles and a potential\nenergy term, and (writing \\(\\Im[z]\\) for the imaginary part \\(b\\) of a\ncomplex number \\(z = a +\\di b)\\) a first-order evolution equation,\n\n\n\nThe Guiding Equation \n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\mathbf{Q}_k}{dt} = \\frac{\\hslash}{m_k} \\Im\n{{\\psi^*\\partial_k\\psi} \\over{\\psi^*\\psi}} (\\mathbf{Q}_1 ,\\ldots\n,\\mathbf{Q}_N) \\]\n\n \n\n\nfor \\(Q(t)\\), the simplest first-order evolution equation for the\npositions of the particles that is compatible with the Galilean (and\ntime-reversal) covariance of the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution\n(D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, & Zangh\u00ec 1992a: 852\u2013854). Here\n\\(\\hslash\\) is Planck\u2019s constant divided by \\(2\\pi\\),\nm\\(_k\\) is the mass of the \\(k\\)-th particle, and\n\\(\\partial_k = (\\partial /\\partial x_k,\\partial /\\partial y_k,\\partial\n/\\partial z_k)\\) is the gradient with respect to the generic\ncoordinates \\(\\boldsymbol{q}_k = (x_k,y_k,z_k)\\) of the \\(k\\)-th\nparticle. If \\(\\psi\\) is spinor-valued, the two products involving\n\\(\\psi\\) in the equation should be understood as scalar products\n(involving sums of products of spinor components). When external\nmagnetic fields are present, the gradient should be understood as the\ncovariant derivative, involving the vector potential. (Since the\ndenominator on the right hand side of the guiding equation vanishes at\nthe nodes of \\(\\psi\\), global existence and uniqueness for the Bohmian\ndynamics is a nontrivial matter. It is proven in Berndl, D\u00fcrr, et\nal. 1995 and in Teufel and Tumulka 2005.) \n\nFor an \\(N\\)-particle system these two equations (together with the\ndetailed specification of the Hamiltonian, including all interactions\ncontributing to the potential energy) completely define Bohmian\nmechanics. This deterministic theory of particles in motion accounts\nfor all the phenomena of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, from\ninterference effects to spectral lines (Bohm 1952: 175\u2013178) to\nspin (Bell 1964: 10). And it does so in an entirely ordinary manner, as we\nexplain in the following sections.\n\nFor a scalar wave function, describing particles without spin, the\nform of\n the guiding equation\n above is a little more complicated than necessary, since the complex\nconjugate of the wave function, which appears in the numerator and the\ndenominator, cancels out. If one looks for an evolution equation for\nthe configuration compatible with the space-time symmetries of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, one almost immediately arrives at\nthe guiding equation in this simpler form as the simplest\npossibility.\n\nHowever, the form above has two advantages: First, it makes sense for\nparticles with spin\u2014and, in fact, Bohmian mechanics without\nfurther ado accounts for all the apparently paradoxical quantum\nphenomena associated with spin. Secondly, and this is crucial to the\nfact that Bohmian mechanics is empirically equivalent to orthodox\nquantum theory, the right hand side of the guiding equation is\n\\(J/\\varrho\\), the ratio of the quantum probability current to the\nquantum probability density. This shows that it should require no\nimagination whatsoever to guess the guiding equation from\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, provided one is looking for one,\nsince the classical formula for current is density times velocity.\nMoreover, it follows from the quantum continuity equation \\(\\partial\n\\varrho /\\partial t + \\textrm{div} J = 0\\), an immediate consequence\nof Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, that if at some time (say the\ninitial time) the configuration \\(Q\\) of our system is random, with\ndistribution given by \\(\\lvert \\psi \\rvert^2 = \\psi *\\psi\\), this will\nalways be true (provided the system does not interact with its\nenvironment).\n\nThis demonstrates that it is wrong to claim that the predictions of\nquantum theory are incompatible with the existence of hidden\nvariables, with an underlying deterministic model in which quantum\nrandomness arises from averaging over ignorance. Bohmian mechanics\nprovides us with just such a model: For any quantum experiment we\nmerely take as the relevant Bohmian system the combined system,\nincluding the system upon which the experiment is performed as well as\nall the measuring instruments and other devices used to perform the\nexperiment (together with all other systems with which these have\nsignificant interaction over the course of the experiment). We then\nobtain the \u201chidden variables\u201d model by regarding the\ninitial configuration of this big system as random in the usual\nquantum mechanical way, with distribution given by \\(\\lvert \\psi\n\\rvert^2\\). The guiding equation for the big system then transforms\nthe initial configuration into the final configuration at the\nconclusion of the experiment. It then follows that this final\nconfiguration of the big system, including in particular the\norientation of instrument pointers, will also be distributed in the\nquantum mechanical way. Thus our deterministic Bohmian model yields\nthe usual quantum predictions for the results of the experiment.\n\nAs the preceding paragraph suggests, and as we discuss in more detail\nlater, Bohmian mechanics does not need any \u201cmeasurement\npostulates\u201d or axioms governing the behavior of other\n\u201cobservables\u201d. Any such axioms would be at best redundant\nand could be inconsistent.\n\nBesides the\n guiding equation,\n there are other velocity formulas with nice properties, including\nGalilean symmetry, and yielding theories that are empirically\nequivalent to orthodox quantum theory\u2014and to Bohmian mechanics\n(Deotto & Ghirardi 1998). The Bohmian choice is arguably the\nsimplest. Moreover, Wiseman (2007) has shown that it is the Bohmian\nvelocity formula, given by the\n guiding equation,\n that, according to orthodox quantum theory, would be found in a\n\u201cweak measurement\u201d of the velocity of a particle. (Marian,\nZangh\u00ec, and Oriols 2016 have recently proposed an explicit\nprocedure for performing such a measurement.) And, somewhat\nparadoxically, it can be shown (D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, &\nZangh\u00ec 2009) that according to Bohmian mechanics such a\nmeasurement is indeed a genuine measurement of the particle\u2019s\nvelocity\u2014despite the existence of empirically equivalent\nvelocity formulas! Similarly, weak measurements could be used to\nmeasure trajectories. In fact, quite recently Kocsis et al. (2011)\nhave used weak measurements to reconstruct the trajectories for single\nphotons \u201cas they undergo two-slit interference\u201d, finding\n\u201cthose predicted in the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation of\nquantum mechanics\u201d. And Mahler et al. 2016 have experimentally\nfound, using weak measurements, \u201cBohmian trajectories\u201d for\nentangled photons, illustrating quantum nonlocality and the phenomenon\nof \u201csurreal Bohmian trajectories\u201d. \n\nFor a single particle the guiding equation defines the motion of a\nparticle guided by a wave in physical 3-dimensional space. One might\nexpect that similar motions might arise classically. Couder & Fort\n(2006) have shown, by investigating interference-like phenomena in the\nmotion of bouncing oil droplets in a fluid, that this is indeed so.\nBush (2015) has further explored this sort of possibility for the\nemergence of a Bohmian version of quantum mechanics from something\nlike classical fluid dynamics. A serious obstacle to the success of\nsuch a program is the quantum entanglement and nonlocality\ncharacteristic of many-particle quantum systems.\n\nThe \u201cmany interacting worlds\u201d approach of Hall, Deckert,\n& Wiseman (2014), independently advanced by Sebens (2015), retains\nparticle trajectories but attempts to do away with a wave-function at\nthe level of fundamental ontology. What takes its place is a large\nnumber of trajectories in configuration space, with each trajectory\nregarded as actual and as corresponding to the motions of a finite\nnumber of particles in physical space regarded as describing a world\nin its own right.  These interact in such a way as to mimic\ntrajectories guided by a wave function: a coarse-grained density of\nworlds takes the place of \\(\\lvert \\psi \\rvert^2\\). The velocities of\nthe world-particles are required to at least approximately be related\nto their configurations via some smooth function on configuration\nspace. This condition would be a rather surprising one for the sorts\nof large systems studied in statistical mechanics. Even more\nunmotivated from a classical perspective, the velocity function must\nbe the gradient of a multivalued function that obeys a\nBohr-Sommerfeld-like quantum condition. \n\nWe stress that Bohmian mechanics should be regarded as a theory in its\nown right. Its viability does not depend on its being derivable from\nsome other theory, classical or otherwise.\n",
