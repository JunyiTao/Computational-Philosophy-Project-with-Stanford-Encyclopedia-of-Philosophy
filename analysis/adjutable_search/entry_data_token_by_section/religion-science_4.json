    "main_text": "Science and religion in various religions\n2. Science and religion in various religions\n\nAs noted, most studies on the relationship between science and\nreligion have focused on science and Christianity, with only a small\nnumber of publications devoted to other religious traditions (e.g.,\nBrooke & Numbers 2011; Lopez 2008). Since science makes universal\nclaims, it is easy to assume that its encounter with other religious\ntraditions would be similar to its interactions with Christianity.\nHowever, given different creedal tenets (e.g., in Hindu traditions God\nis usually not entirely distinct from creation, unlike in Christianity\nand Judaism), and because science has had distinct historical\ntrajectories in other cultures, one can expect disanalogies in the\nrelationship between science and religion in different religious\ntraditions. To give a sense of this diversity, this section provides a\nbird\u2019s eye view of science and religion in five major world\nreligions: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism.\n",
