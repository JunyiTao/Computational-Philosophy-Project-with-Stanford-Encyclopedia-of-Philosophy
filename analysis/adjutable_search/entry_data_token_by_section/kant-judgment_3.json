    "main_text": "The Nature of Judgment || Judgments, objective validity, objective reality, and truth\n1.3 Judgments, objective validity, objective reality, and truth\n\nThe characteristically rational activity of taking-for-true implies\nthe subjective validity of a judgment, or its apparent meaningfulness\nand apparent truth for an individual rational cognizer. By contrast,\nthe \u201cobjective validity\u201d (objektiv\nG\u00fcltigkeit) of a judgment is its empirical meaningfulness,\nprecisely because it is compositionally based on the empirical\n\u201creference\u201d (Beziehung)\u2014whether singular or\ncomprehensional\u2014of the basic constituent objective\nrepresentations of any judgment, namely intuitions and concepts. The\nempirical reference of intuitions and concepts, in turn, is\nnecessarily constrained by the specifically aesthetic or sensible,\nnon-conceptual, non-discursive, and pre-rational or proto-rational\ndimension of human experience, which itself is jointly determined by\n(a) the brute givenness of material objects to our receptive capacity\nfor empirical intuition, via the relation of external affection, and\n(b) the necessary and non-empirical forms of empirical intuition, our\nrepresentations of space and time (A19\u201322/B33\u201336), which\nultimately express the outer and inner sensory aspects of the\nembodiment of our minds). In this way, an intuition is objectively\nvalid if and only if either (i) it directly refers to some individual\nactual or possible external sensible object or to the subject\u2019s\nphenomenally conscious inner response to this outer reference (this\naccounts for the objective validity of empirical intuitions),\nor else (ii) it represents a phenomenally immanent necessary condition\nof empirical intuitions (this accounts for the objective validity of\nthe forms of intuition) (A239\u2013240/B298\u2013299). By\ncontrast, a concept is objectively valid if and only if either it\napplies to some actual or possible objects of empirical intuition\n(this accounts for the objective validity of empirical\nconcepts) or else it represents a necessary condition of empirical\nconcepts (this accounts for the objective validity of pure\nconcepts) (A239\u2013240/B298\u2013299,\nA240\u2013242/B299\u2013300).\n\nA necessary but not sufficient condition of the objective validity of\na judgment is its logico-syntactic well-formedness (grammatical\ncorrectness) and logico-semantic well-formedness (sortal correctness)\n(A73/98, A240\u2013248/B300\u2013305). So a judgment is objectively\nvalid if and only if it is logically well-formed and all of its\nconstituent intuitions and concepts are objectively valid\n(A155\u2013156/B194\u2013195). Otherwise put, and fully spelled-out,\nthe objective validity of a judgment is its anthropocentric\nrational empirical referential meaningfulness. Kant also\nsometimes uses the notion of \u201cobjective reality\u201d\n(objektive Realit\u00e4t) to characterize objectively valid\nrepresentations that apply specifically to actually or really existing\nobjects, and not to merely possible objects (A242 n.). True judgments\nare thus objectively real propositions. Objective validity, in turn,\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition of truth, and hence of\nobjectively real propositions, for false judgments are also\nobjectively valid (A58/B83). In this way the objective validity of a\njudgment is equivalent to its propositional truth-valuedness,\nbut not equivalent to its propositional truth.\n\nBy contrast, all judgments that are not objectively valid are\n\u201cempty\u201d (leer) or truth-valueless. Nevertheless,\nit must be noted that for Kant empty judgments can still be rationally\nintelligible and not in any way nonsensical, if all the concepts\ncontained within them are at least logically consistent or\n\u201cthinkable\u201d (Bxxvi n.). In this way, e.g., some judgments\ncontaining concepts of noumenal objects (things-in-themselves, or real\nessences) or noumenal subjects (rational-agents-in-themselves, or\npersons) are empirically meaningless and truth-valueless, hence empty,\nyet also are rationally intelligible targets of what Kant\ncalls \u201cdoctrinal\u201d belief (see the supplementary document\n Judging, Believing, and Scientific Knowing),\n and even, at least from a certain Critical meta-philosophical\nstandpoint, essential both to Kant\u2019s theoretical metaphysics\n(A254\u2013255/B309\u2013310, A650\u2013654/B678\u2013682) and\nalso to his practical metaphysics of freedom and morality\n(A530\u2013558/B566\u2013586).\n\nSo much for truth-valuedness: but what is truth? According to Kant,\ntruth is a predicate of whole judgments, and not a predicate of the\nrepresentational proper parts of judgments, i.e.,\nintuitions/non-conceptual cognitions and concepts (A293/B350).\nFurthermore we already know that objective validity is a necessary but\nnot sufficient condition of the truth of a judgment. Kant also holds\nthat logical consistency is a necessary but not sufficient condition\nof the truth of a judgment (A60/B85). Most importantly however,\naccording to Kant the \u201cnominal definition\u201d of truth is\nthat it is the \u201cagreement\u201d or \u201ccorrespondence\u201d\n(\u00dcbereinstimmung) of a cognition (i.e., in this context,\nan objectively valid judgment) with its object (A58/B82). Now a\nKantian nominal definition is a special type of analytic definition\nthat picks out the \u201clogical essence\u201d of that\nconcept\u2014i.e., the generic and specific intensional criteria for\nbringing things under that concept\u2014but without also\npicking out the \u201cinner determinations\u201d or real essences of\nthe things falling within the comprehension of that concept, which\nwould be the job of a real definition (9: 142\u2013143). So\nthe nominal definition of truth means that for Kant truth just\nis agreement or correspondence, which can then be further\nunpacked as a relation between a judgment and an object such that (i)\nthe form or structure of the object is isomorphic with the\nlogico-syntactic and logico-semantic form of the proposition expressed\nby the judgment, (ii) the judger cognitively orients herself in the\nworld by projecting the object under specific \u201cpoints of\nview\u201d (Gesichtspunkte) or modes of presentation that\nwould also be typically cognitively associated with the constituent\nconcepts of the judgment by any other rational human animal in that\ncontext (8: 134\u2013137) (9: 57, 147) (24: 779), and (iii) the\nobject represented by the judgment really exists (Hanna 2006b, ch. 5).\nAnother way of putting this is to say that truth is nothing but\nthe objective reality of the total propositional\nform-and-content of the judgment: that is, nothing but the real\nexistence of that which is precisely specified by the logico-syntactic\nand logico-semantic features of the judgment taken together with the\njudger\u2019s intersubjectively rationally communicable cognitive\norientation. Or in still other words, true judgments are nothing\nbut ways of rationally projecting ourselves onto actual\ntruth-makers. This is not what is nowadays called a\n\u201cdeflationist\u201d conception of truth, however, because Kant\nis not saying that truth is nothing but asserting the corresponding\nactual facts. On the contrary, for Kant truth is irreducible to merely\nasserting the facts, because for him the concept of truth also\ninherently expresses both the judger\u2019s fundamental rational\ninterest in \u201cgetting it right\u201d (whether theoretically via\ntrue judgment or practically via good intentional action) and also her\nintersubjectively shareable and rationally communicable cognitive\norientation, as well as belonging intrinsically to the core moral\nconcept of sincerity.\n\nIn any case, the nominal definition of truth must be sharply\ndistinguished from the real definition of truth, i.e., the\n\u201ccriterion\u201d (Kriterium) of truth, which is a rule\nfor determining the truth or falsity of judgments in specific contexts\n(A58/B82). According to Kant there is no all-purpose or absolutely\ngeneral criterion of truth (A58\u201359), such as the\n\u201cclarity-and-distinctness\u201d criterion of the Cartesians.\nNevertheless there are special criteria of truth for each of\nthe basic classes of judgments: analytic judgments, synthetic a\nposteriori (or empirical) judgments, and synthetic a priori judgments\n(for more details about this threefold distinction and the special\ntruth-criteria, see\n Section 2).\n\nThe truth of empirical judgments is the bottom-level sort of truth for\nKant, in that all of the other kinds of truth presuppose it. In turn,\nthe proper object of an empirical judgment is an actual or possible\n\u201cobject of experience\u201d (Gegenstand der\nErfahrung), which is an empirical state-of-affairs, or a really\npossible individual material object insofar as it has macroscopic\nphysical or \u201cphenomenological\u201d (in the Newtonian sense)\nproperties and can enter into causal or otherwise dynamical relations\nin the spatiotemporal material world according to necessary laws of\nnature (A176\u2013218/B218\u2013265). By the nominal definition of\ntruth as agreement or correspondence, this entails that actual objects\nof experience are the truth-makers of empirical judgments. It\nalso leads to what Kant calls \u201cthe criterion of empirical\ntruth\u201d which states that since the objectively valid\npropositional content of an empirical judgment can be specified as a\nnecessary conceptual rule of sensory appearances, then if\nthat rule is effectively applied to the temporal succession of our\nsensory representations of the phenomenal material world, and\nthat rule coheres with the causal-dynamic laws of nature,\nthen that judgment is true (A191/B236, A451/B479) (4: 290)\n(18: 234).\n\nSee the supplementary documents:\n\n\nThe Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism\n\n\nJudging, Believing, and Scientific Knowing\n\n\n",
