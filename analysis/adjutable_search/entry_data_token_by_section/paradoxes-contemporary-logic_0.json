    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nBetween the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th\ncentury, the foundations of logic and mathematics were affected by the\ndiscovery of a number of difficulties\u2014the so-called\nparadoxes\u2014involving fundamental notions and basic methods of\ndefinition and inference, which were usually accepted as\nunproblematic. Since then paradoxes have acquired a new role in\ncontemporary logic: indeed, they have led to theorems (usually\nnegative results, such as unprovability and undecidability) and they\nare not simply confined to the realm of a sterile dialectic. Several\nbasic notions of logic, as it is presently taught, have reached their\npresent shape at the end of a process which has been often triggered\nby various attempts to solve paradoxes. This is especially true for\nthe notions of set and collection in general, for\nthe basic syntactical and semantical concepts of standard\nclassical logic (logical languages of a given order, the notion\nof satisfiability, definability). After the first forty years, the\nby-products of the paradoxes included axiomatizations of set theory, a\nsystematic development of type theory, the foundations of semantics, a\ntheory of formal systems (at least in nuce), besides the\nintroduction of the dichotomy predicative/impredicative which\nwas important for conceptual reasons, but also for the future of proof\ntheoretical methods.\n",
