    "main_text": "The Epistemic View of Games || Epistemic Game Theory\n1.2 Epistemic Game Theory\nEpistemic game theory is a broad area of research encompassing a\nnumber of different mathematical frameworks that are used to analyze\ngames. The details of the frameworks are different, but they do share\na common perspective. In this Section, we discuss two key features of\nthis common perspective.\n\n(1)\n\nEpistemic game theory takes a broadly Bayesian perspective on\ndecision-making in strategic situations.\n\n\nThis point of view is nicely explained by Robert Stalnaker:\n\nThere is no special concept of rationality for decision making in a\nsituation where the outcomes depend on the actions of more than one\nagent. The acts of other agents are, like chance events, natural\ndisasters and acts of God, just facts about an uncertain world that\nagents have beliefs and degrees of belief about. The utilities of\nother agents are relevant to an agent only as information that,\ntogether with beliefs about the rationality of those agents, helps to\npredict their actions. (Stalnaker 1996: 136)\n\nIn other words, epistemic game theory can be seen as an attempt to\nbring back the theory of decision making in games to its\ndecision-theoretic roots.\nIn decision theory, the decision-making units are individuals with\npreferences over the possible consequences of their actions. Since the\nconsequence of a given action depend on the state of the environment,\nthe decision-maker\u2019s beliefs about the state of the environment\nare crucial to assess the rationality of a particular decision. So,\nthe formal description of a decision problem includes the possible\noutcomes and states of the environment, the decision maker\u2019s\npreferences over these outcome, and a description of the\ndecision maker\u2019s beliefs about the state of nature\n(i.e., the decision maker\u2019s doxastic state). A\ndecision-theoretic choice rule can be used to make\nrecommendations to the decision maker about what she should\nchoose (or to predict what the decision-maker will choose). A\nstandard example of a choice rule is maximization of (subjective)\nexpected utility, underlying the Bayesian view of\nrationality. It presupposes that the decision maker\u2019s\npreferences and beliefs can be represented by numerical utilities and\nprobabilities, \nrespectively.[2]\n (We postpone the formal\nrepresentation of this, and the other choice rules such as weak and\nstrict dominance, until we have presented the formal models of beliefs\nin games in Section 2.)\nFrom an epistemic point of view, the classical ingredients of a\ngame (players, actions, outcomes, and preferences) are thus not enough\nto formulate recommendations or predictions about how the players\nshould or will choose. One needs to specify the (interactive) decision\nproblem the players are in, i.e., also the beliefs players\nhave about each other\u2019s possible actions (and beliefs). In a\nterminology that is becoming increasingly popular in epistemic game\ntheory, games are played in specific contexts (Friedenberg\n& Meier 2010, Other Internet Resources), in which the players have\nspecific knowledge and/or beliefs about each other. The\nrecommendations and/or predictions that are appropriate for one\ncontext may not transfer to another, even if the underlying situation\nmay correspond to precisely the same strategic game.\n\n(2)\n\nIn epistemic game theory, uncertainty about opponents\u2019\nstrategies takes center-stage.\n\n\nThere are various types of information that a player has access to\nin a game situation. For instance, a player may have\n\nimperfect information about the play of the game (which moves have\nbeen played?);\nincomplete information about the structure of the game (what are\nthe actions/payoffs?);\nstrategic information (what will the other players do?);\nor\nhigher-order information (what are the other players\nthinking?).\n\nWhile all types of uncertainty may play a role in an epistemic\nanalysis of a game, a distinguishing feature of epistemic game theory\nis an insistence that rational decisions are assessed in terms of the\nplayers\u2019 preferences and beliefs about what their\nopponents are going to do. Again we turn to Stalnaker to summarize\nthis point of view:\n\n\u2026There are no special rules of rationality telling one what\nto do in the absence of degrees of belief [about the opponents\u2019\nchoices], except this: decide what you believe, and then maximize\nexpected utility. (Stalnaker 1996: 136)\n\nThe four types of uncertainty in games introduced above are\nconceptually important, but not necessarily exhaustive nor mutually\nexclusive. John Harsanyi, for instance, argued that all uncertainty\nabout the structure of the game, that is all possible incompleteness\nin information, can be reduced to uncertainty about the payoffs\n(Harsanyi 1967\u201368). (This was later formalized and proved by\nStuart and Hu 2002). In a similar vein, Kadane & Larkey (1982)\nargue that only strategic uncertainty is relevant for the assessment\nof decision in game situations. Contemporary epistemic game theory\ntakes the view that, although it may ultimately be reducible to\nstrategic uncertainty, making higher-order uncertainty explicit can\nclarify a great deal of what interactive or strategic rationality\nmeans.\nThe crucial difference from the classical\n\u201csolution-concept\u201d analysis of a game is that epistemic\ngame theory takes a bottom-up perspective. Once the context of the\ngame is specified, the rational outcomes are derived, given\nassumptions about how the players are making their choices and what\nthey know and believe about how the others are choosing. In the\nremainder of this section, we briefly discuss some general issues that\narise from taking an epistemic perspective on games. We postpone\ndiscussion of higher-order and strategic uncertainty until Sections 3,\n4 and 5.\n",
