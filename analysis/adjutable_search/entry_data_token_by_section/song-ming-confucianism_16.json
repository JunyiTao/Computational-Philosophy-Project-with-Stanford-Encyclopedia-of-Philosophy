By the start of the\nSong, regions outside the capital had been governed for many centuries\nby a relatively centralized and meritocratic system known as the\n\u201ccommandery system\u201d (junxian \u90e1\u7e23).\nAccording to the rules of this system, regional governors were to be\nselected from among those who had performed very well on the civil\nservice exams, and they were appointed at the discretion of the\nemperor or his court. There were also restrictions that were meant to\nprevent governors from developing stronger loyalties to their local\ncommunities than the emperor. For example, governors were required to\nswitch posts on a regular basis and were not appointed to districts\nthat included their home towns.\n\nMany Song-Ming Confucians recognized that the commandery system was\ntoo well entrenched to jettison without major conflict or upheaval.\nStill, this did not prevent some political thinkers from advocating\nfor a putatively older and better system known as enfeoffment\n(fengjian \u5c01\u5efa). Official Confucian histories\nsuggested that this system had been in place at the time of the\nsage-kings, which suggested that it had succeeded in creating the high\ndegree of social harmony and virtue that characterized that golden\nage. The most notable feature of the enfeoffment system was that\nregional governorships were inherited titles and thus treated as the\nhereditary rights and responsibilities of certain families (with some\nallowances to forcibly remove vicious or incompetent governors). But\nConfucian proponents of enfeoffment such as Zhang Zai and Hu Hong\n(1106\u20131161) saw a great deal to recommend it. By creating\nregional power bases, they suggested, the Chinese state would be more\nresilient and better able to survive when the emperor or his court\nwere in disarray. They also thought that by having lasting,\nmulti-generational relationships between local governors and their\nsubjects they would help bring about more intimate and family-like\nrelationships between governor and subject, thereby creating\ncircumstances more conducive to social harmony and the cultivation of\nvirtue. Finally, advocates like Zhang and Hu thought that the\nenfeoffment system could be paired with a legendary system of land\ndistribution known as the well-field system, which guaranteed farming\nfamilies relatively equal plots of land with relatively incontestable\nboundaries, all of which was meant to ensure greater equality for\ncommoners and greater peace and accord in general (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 201\u2013206).\n",
