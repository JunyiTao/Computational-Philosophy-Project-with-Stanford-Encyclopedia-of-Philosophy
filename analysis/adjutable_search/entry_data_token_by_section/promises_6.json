    "main_text": "Conventionalism || Paradigmatic Conventionalism\n2.2 Paradigmatic Conventionalism\n\nPerhaps a better way of understanding contemporary conventionalist\ntheories is that they are paradigmatically both normatively and\nontologically conventional about promises. Such a theory is offered by\nJohn Rawls, in his seminal A Theory of Justice (1971).\n\nRawls conceives of promises not as sui generis moral actions,\nbut as essentially institutional artifacts, and thus promissory\nobligations as institutional obligations, grounded in the same manner\nas all such obligations. These institutions are comprised of sets of\nrules that prescribe and proscribe certain sorts of behavior for the\nparticipants in the institution. The dicta of the rules are the\ncontents of moral obligations. Rawls in turn grounds institutional\nobligations in what he calls the principle of fairness.\n\nThe principle of fairness is a basic moral principle, chosen by\ncontractors in the OP. But unlike its more famous Rawlsian cognate the\ndifference principle, the principle of fairness is an individual\nprinciple, one that applies directly to individuals in the society, as\nopposed to the basic institutions of the society themselves. Rawls\nlays out the principle of fairness in the following way:\n\n\n\u2026[A] person is required to do his part as defined by the rules\nof an institution when two conditions are met: first the institution\nis just (or fair)\u2026and second, one has voluntarily accepted the\nbenefits of the arrangement or taken advantage of the opportunities it\noffers to further their own interests. (1971: 111\u2013112)\n\n\nSo there are two conditions on an action\u2019s being an\ninstitutional obligation in the Rawlsian sense: (1) The institution\nwhose rule calls for the action is just, and (2) The person has\n\u201cvoluntarily accepted the benefits\u201d of the\ninstitution.\n\nRawls then introduces three theoretical elements to explain promissory\nobligations in particular. The first is what he calls the rule of\npromising, or the central rule that constitutes the promising\nconvention:\n\n\n[I]f one says the words \u201cI promise to do X\u201d in\nthe appropriate circumstances, one is to do X, unless certain\nexcusing conditions obtain. (Rawls, 1971: 345)\n\n\nRawls doesn\u2019t go into the circumstance and conditions mentioned\nin the rule in any great detail, but he does note that a promise must\nbe voluntary and deliberate. He also notes that a proper rendition of\nsuch clauses is necessary to evaluate whether the institution of\npromising the rule defines is just (1971: 346). The second piece of\ntheory Rawls employs is the notion of a bona fide promise. A bona fide\npromise is a promise that arises in accordance with the rule of\npromising, when the practice [of promising] it represents is just.\n\nAnd the third piece of theory is a moral principle targeted to\npromises directly, what Rawls call the Principle of Fidelity. The\nprinciple of fidelity is merely a derivative of the principle of\nfairness, fashioned specifically for the institution of promising. And\nit says simply that \u201c[B]ona fide promises are to be kept\u201d\n(1971: 347).\n\nThus Rawls\u2019 explanation for the obligatory force of promises is\nroughly: If you make a promise under a just promising institution,\nthen you are obligated to uphold that institution (and obey its rules)\nbecause to do otherwise would be to \u201cfree-ride\u201d on the\ninstitution in a manner forbidden by the principle of fairness.\n\nSo, unlike Hobbes and Hume, for Rawls the convention is both source of\npromises as a phenomenon and the source of the moral justification for\npromissory obligation. Individual promises are \u201cmoves\u201d in\nthe promising game, as home runs are moves in baseball, and promissory\nobligations are grounded in the value of the convention directly.\n\nAnother important contemporary branch of conventionalist theory is\npropounded by John Searle (1965, inter alia) Like Rawls,\nSearle takes promises to be essentially institutional actions, made\npossible by the very rules of the promising convention. Similarly,\npromissory obligations are a kind of institutional obligation, one\nthat attends those already bound by the institution. And ultimately,\nthe normative force of the individual promises is grounded in the\nvalue of the convention as a whole.
