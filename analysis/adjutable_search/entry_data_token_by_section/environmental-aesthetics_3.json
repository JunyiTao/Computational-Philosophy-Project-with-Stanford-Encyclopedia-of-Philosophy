    "main_text": "Twentieth Century Developments\n2. Twentieth Century Developments\n\nWestern philosophical study of the aesthetics of the natural world\nreached a low point in the middle of the twentieth century, with the\nfocus of analytic aesthetics almost exclusively on philosophy of art.\nAt the same time, both the view that aesthetic appreciation of nature\nis parasitic upon that of art and even the idea that it is not in fact\naesthetic appreciation at all were defended by some thinkers. However,\nin the last third of the century, there was a reaction to the neglect\nof the natural world by the discipline of aesthetics, which initiated\na revival of the aesthetic investigation of nature and led to the\nemergence of environmental aesthetics.\n",
