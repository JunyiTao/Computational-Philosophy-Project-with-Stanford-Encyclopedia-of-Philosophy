African American Philosophizings Born of Struggles\n\n\nThe United States of America is one of several New World diasporic\ncontexts of focus for these recovery and study efforts that are being\nconducted under the heading of \u201cAfrican American\nphilosophy.\u201d What follows is a historically contextualized\ndiscussion of several instances of the emergence of philosophizings\nborn of struggles. However, it would be an ethical travesty and a\ncase of epistemological presentist imperialism to require that\nthoughtful, critically reflective articulations by African Americans\nconsidered as instances of philosophizing worthy of the critical\nattention of professional philosophers first meet rigorous, formal\nstandards for \u201cright reasoning\u201d settled on by professionals\nin the discipline during the late twentieth and early twenty-first\ncenturies. For the contexts in which folks of African descent were\ncompelled to reflect on and reason about their first-order lived\nexperiences were substantially conditioned by the agendas and social\nlogics of projects of White Racial Supremacy and constitutive invidious\nanthropologies of raciality, ethnicity, and gender, not agendas\ngoverned by the academic logics of abstract formal reasoning. The\npressing exigencies of daily, cross-generation life under racialized\nenslavement and oppression were what compelled reflective\nthoughtfulness, not leisured, abstractive speculation. Again, what has\nto be witnessed and appreciated across the historical and hermeneutical\ndistances of centuries of history and life-world experiences structured\nby contemporary personal and social freedoms are the natures of the\nlived experiences and situations of those whose articulations, whose\nphilosophizings, are considered as having been born of\nstruggles.\n\n\nMuch psychic energy had to be expended by New World African and\nAfrican-descended peoples contending with the institutionalization of\ntheir enslavement and oppression otherwise that was racialized,\nthereby naturalized, and thoroughly sanctioned and justified by every\nenterprise of deliberate, normative thought and aesthetic\nexpression\u2014law, science, theology, religion, philosophy,\naesthetics, and secular \u201ccommon sense.\u201d (For a historical\naccount of African-American life in the United States see Franklin and\nMoss, Jr. 2000.) In each case a primary resource was the foundational\nmetaphysical and ontological \u201cunit idea\u201d of a hierarchical\nGreat Chain of Being (Lovejoy 1964) on which each race was believed to\nhave a fixed and determining place. Accordingly, as\nliving property it was encumbered on enslaved Africans and\ntheir descendants to live so as to make good on the investments in\ntheir purchase and maintenance by engaging in productive labor,\nwithout compensation, and to endure and reproduce\nas ontological slaves in order to sustain and justify the\ninstitution of their imprisonment. According to this supposedly\ndivinely sanctioned philosophical anthropology, African and\nAfrican-descended children, women, and men were defined as\nconstituting a category of being to which none of the normative moral\nand ethical notions and principles governing civilized life\napplied. Pressed into an ethically null category, they were compelled\nto live lives of\nsocial death stripped of defining webs of ennobling meaning\nconstituted by narratives of previous histories, renewing presents, and\nimagined and anticipated futures of flourishing, cross-generational\ncontinuation.\n\n\nOn the whole, they did not succumb to the requirement to become\nsocially dead, certainly not completely, though many thousands did.\nAlways there were those who cultivated strengths of body,\nmind, soul, and spirit and exerted these in defense of the preservation\nof senses of themselves and of their peoples, of their\n\u201crace,\u201d as having worth beyond the definitions and\nvaluations set on them by rationalizations of institutionalized\nenslavement and oppression. Always there were those who, in\nthe cracks, crevices, and severely limited spaces of slave life and\nconstricted freedom, preserved and shared fading memories of lives of\nbeauty and integrity before the holocaust; who found, created, and\nrenewed nurturings of imaginings of better life to come through\nmusic-making, dancing, and creative expression in the artful fashioning\nand use of items of material culture, and in the communal and personal\nrelations, secular and spiritual, that the slaves formed, sustained,\nand passed on.\n\n\nNurtured by these efforts, they resisted the imposition of\nontological death and nurtured others in resisting. They reflected on\ntheir existence and the conditions thereof; conceived of and put into\npractice ways to endure without succumbing, ways to struggle against\nenslavement and the curtailment otherwise of their lives and\naspirations; and conceived and acted on ways to escape. They studied\ncarefully their enslavers and oppressors and assessed the moral\nsignificance of all aspects of the lives enslavers and oppressors led\nand determined how they, though enslaved and despised, must live\ndifferently so as not to follow their oppressors and enslavers on paths\nto moral depravity. They conceived of other matters, including the\nterms and conditions of freedom and justice; of better terms and\nconditions of existence and of personal and social identities; of how\nto resist and endure while creating things of beauty; how to love in\nspite of their situations; conceived of their very nature as living\nbeings \u2026\n",
