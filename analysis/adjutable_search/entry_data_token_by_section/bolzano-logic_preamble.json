    "main_text": "\n\nOne of the great philosophers of the nineteenth century, Bernard\nBolzano (1781\u20131848) made outstanding contributions in a number\nof fields (for a more comprehensive survey of his thought and\nbiographical details, see Edgar Morscher\u2019s\n article\n on Bolzano in this Encyclopedia). As a logician, he focussed on\nfoundations, developing a theoretical framework that is still very\nmuch worth studying today, so much so that a highly respected\ncontemporary logician could (only half facetiously) write a quite\npositive review of Bolzano\u2019s Theory of Science (1837)\nas if it had just appeared (van Benthem, 2013). This is not to say\nthat all aspects of Bolzano\u2019s logical work could be mistaken for\ncontemporary productions: if he seems at times to be at home in the\ntwenty-first century, it is equally clear at others that we have to do\nwith a thinker who was born in the eighteenth.\n\nBolzano\u2019s presentation of logic in the modern sense is embedded\nin the vast Theory of Science (henceforth TS; a\nshorter introduction to Bolzano\u2019s logic may be found in Bolzano\n2004a). The best known innovations of this work belong to his\nvariation logic: definitions of universal validity and analyticity,\nalong with the creation of a complete system of extensional relations\nbetween propositions, the most important being compatibility,\ndeducibility (consequence), and equivalence. Bolzano discovered the\nlink between deducibility and conditional probability, according to\nwhich deducibility and incompatibility appear as two limit cases of\nconditional probability. He is also recognized for adopting an\nanti-psychologistic approach to logic, and for his contributions to\nsemantics. Bolzano\u2019s theory of the grounding relation\n(Abfolge) leading to a hierarchical order among the\npropositions of a deductive science is the first modern study of\naxiomatic systems. Moreover, the thorough discussions of concepts of\nlogic and many other insights contribute to make the TS one\nof the classical works in logic and epistemology, on a par with those\nof Aristotle, Leibniz, and Frege. The extensive historical notes\ncontained in it are a unique source for the history of logic. Although\nwritten in natural language, Bolzano\u2019s logic represents a\ndecisive breakthrough in the development of modern logic.\n",
