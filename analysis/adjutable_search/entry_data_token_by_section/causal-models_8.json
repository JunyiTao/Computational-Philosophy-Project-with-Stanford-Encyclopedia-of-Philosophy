    "main_text": "Deterministic Structural Equation Models || Actual Causation\n3.3 Actual Causation\n\nMany philosophers and legal theorists have been interested in the\nrelation of actual causation. This concerns the assignment of\ncausal responsibility for some event that occurs, based on how events\nactually play out. For example, suppose that Billy and Suzy are both\nholding rocks. Suzy throws her rock at a window, but Billy does not.\nSuzy\u2019s rock hits the window, which breaks. Then Suzy\u2019s\nthrow was the actual cause of the window breaking.\n\nWe can represent this story easily enough with a structural equation\nmodel. For variables, we choose:\n\n\\(B = 1\\) if Billy throws, 0 if he doesn\u2019t\n\\(S = 1\\) if Suzy throws, 0 if she doesn\u2019t\n\\(W = 1\\) if the window shatters, 0 if it doesn\u2019t\n\n\nOur context and equation will then be:\n\n\\(B = 0\\)\n\\(S = 1\\)\n\\(W = \\max(B, S)\\)\n\n\nThe equation for W tells us that the window would shatter if\neither Billy or Suzy throws their rock. The corresponding DAG is shown\nin\n Figure 4\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nBut we cannot simply read off the the relation of actual causation\nfrom the graph or from the equations. For example, the arrow from\nB to W in\n Figure 4\n cannot be interpreted as saying that Billy\u2019s (in)action is an\nactual cause of the window breaking. Note that while it is common to\ndistinguish between singular or token causation, and general or\ntype-level causation (see, e.g., Eells 1991, Introduction), that is\nnot what is at issue here. Our causal model does not represent any\nkind of causal generalization: it represents the actual and possible\nactions of Billy and Suzy at one particular place and time. Actual\ncausation is not just causal structure of the single case. A further\ncriterion for actual causation, defined in terms of the causal\nstructure together with the actual values of the variables, is\nneeded.\n\nFollowing Lewis (1973a), it is natural to try to analyze the relation\nof actual causation in terms of counterfactual dependence. In\nour model, the following propositions are all true:\n\n\\(S = 1\\)\n\\(W = 1\\)\n\\({S = 0}\\boxright {W = 0}\\)\n\n\nIn words: Suzy threw her rock, the window shattered, and if Suzy\nhadn\u2019t thrown her rock, the window wouldn\u2019t have\nshattered. In general, we might attempt to analyze actual causation as\nfollows:\n\n\n\\(X = x\\) is an actual cause of \\(Y = y\\) in world w just in\ncase:\n\nX and Y are different variables\n\\(X = x\\) and \\(Y = y\\) in w\nThere exist \\(x' \\ne x\\) and \\(y' \\ne y\\) such that \\({X = x'}\n\\boxright {Y = y'}\\) is true in w\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this simple analysis will not work, for familiar\nreasons involving preemption and overdetermination.\nHere is an illustration of each:\n\n\nPreemption: Billy decides that he will give Suzy the\nopportunity to throw first. If Suzy throws her rock, he will not\nthrow, but if she doesn\u2019t throw, he will throw and his rock will\nshatter the window. In fact, Suzy throws her rock, which shatters the\nwindow. Billy does not throw.\n\nOverdetermination: Billy and Suzy throw their rocks\nsimultaneously. Their rocks hit the window at the same time,\nshattering it. Either rock by itself would have been sufficient to\nshatter the window.\n\n\nIn both of these cases, Suzy\u2019s throw is an actual cause\nof the window\u2019s shattering, but the shattering does not\ncounterfactually depend upon her throw: if Suzy hadn\u2019t thrown\nher rock, Billy\u2019s rock would have shattered the window. Much of\nthe work on counterfactual theories of causation since 1973 has been\ndevoted to addressing these problems.\n\nA number of authors have used SEMs to try to formulate adequate\nanalyses of actual causation in terms of counterfactuals, including\nBeckers & Vennekens (2018), Glymour & Wimberly (2007), Halpern\n(2016), Halpern & Pearl (2001, 2005), Hitchcock (2001), Pearl\n(2009: Chapter 10), Weslake (forthcoming), and Woodward (2003: Chapter\n2). As an illustration, consider one analysis based closely on\na proposal presented in Halpern (2016):\n\n\n(AC) \\(X = x\\) is an actual cause of \\(Y = y\\) in\nworld w just in case:\n\n\nX and Y are different variables\n\\(X = x\\) and \\(Y = y\\) in w\nThere exist disjoint sets of variables \\(\\bX\\) and \\(\\bZ\\) with\n\\(X \\in \\bX\\), with values \\(\\bX = \\bx\\) and \\(\\bZ = \\bz\\) in\nw, such that:\n\n\nThere exists \\(\\bx' \\ne \\bx\\) such that \n\n\\[({\\bX = \\bx'} \\amp {\\bZ = \\bz}) \\boxright  {Y \\ne y}\\] \n\n is true in\nw\nNo subset of \\(\\bX\\) satisfies (3a)\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, X belongs to a minimal set of variables \\(\\bX\\), such\nthat when we intervene to hold the variables in \\(\\bZ\\) fixed at the\nvalues they actually take in w, Y counterfactually\ndepends upon the values of the variables in \\(\\bX.\\) We will\nillustrate this account with our examples of preemption and\noverdetermination.\n\nIn Preemption, let the variables B, S, and\nW be defined as above. Our context and equations are:\n\n\\(S = 1\\)\n\\(B = 1 - S\\)\n\\(W = \\max(B, S)\\)\n\n\nThat is: Suzy throws her rock; Billy will throw his rock if Suzy\ndoesn\u2019t; and the window will shatter if either throws their\nrock. The DAG is shown in\n Figure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nWe want to show that \\(S = 1\\) is an actual cause of \\(W = 1\\).\nConditions AC(1) and AC(2) are clearly satisfied. For condition AC(3),\nwe choose \\(\\bX = \\{S\\}\\) and \\(\\bZ = \\{B\\}\\). Since \\(B = 0\\) in\nPreemption, we want to fix \\(B = 0\\) while varying S.\nWe can see easily that \\({S = 0} \\amp {B = 0} \\boxright {W = 0}\\):\nreplacing the two equations for B and S with \\(B = 0\\)\nand \\(S = 0\\), the solution yields \\(W = 0\\). In words, this\ncounterfactual says that if neither Billy nor Suzy had thrown their\nrock, the window would not have shattered. Thus condition AC(3a) is\nsatisfied. AC(3b) is satisfied trivially, since \\(\\bX = \\{S\\}\\) is a\nsingleton set.\n\nHere is how AC works in this example. S influences W\nalong two different paths: the direct path \\(S \\rightarrow W\\) and the\nindirect path \\(S \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow W\\). These two paths\ninteract in such a way that they cancel each other out, and the value\nof S makes no net difference to the value of W. However,\nby holding B fixed at its actual value of 0, we eliminate the\ninfluence of S on W along that path. The result is that\nwe isolate the contribution that S made to W along the\ndirect path. AC defines actual causation as a particular kind of\npath-specific effect.\n\nTo treat Overdetermination, let B, S, and\nW keep the same meanings. Our setting and equation will be:\n\n\\(B = 1\\)\n\\(S = 1\\)\n\\(W = \\max(B, S)\\)\n\n\nThe graph is the same as that shown in\n Figure 4\n above. Again, we want to show that \\(S = 1\\) is an actual cause of\n\\(W = 1\\). Conditions AC(1) and AC(2) are obviously satisfied. For\nAC(3), we choose \\(\\bX = \\{B, S\\}\\) and \\(\\bZ = \\varnothing\\). For\ncondition AC(3a), we choose for our alternate setting \\(\\bX = \\bx'\\) \\(B =\n0\\) and \\(S = 0\\). Once again, the counterfactual \\({S = 0} \\amp {B =\n0} \\boxright {W = 0}\\) is true. Now, for AC(3b) we must show that \\(\\bX\n= \\{B, S\\}\\) is minimal. It is easy to check that \\(\\{B\\}\\) alone\nwon\u2019t satisfy AC(3a). Whether we take \\(\\bZ = \\varnothing\\) or\n\\(\\bZ = \\{S\\}\\), changing B to 0 (perhaps while also setting\nS to 1) will not change the value of W. A parallel\nargument shows that \\(\\{S\\}\\) alone won\u2019t satisfy AC(3a) either.\nThe key idea here is that S is a member of a minimal set of\nvariables that need to be changed in order to change the value of\nW.\n\nDespite these successes, none of the analyses of actual causation\ndeveloped so far perfectly captures our pre-theoretic intuitions in\nevery case. One strategy that has been pursued by a number of authors\nis to incorporate some distinction between default and\ndeviant values of variables, or between normal and\nabnormal conditions. See, e.g., Hall (2007), Halpern (2008;\n2016: Chapter 3), Halpern & Hitchcock (2015), Hitchcock (2007),\nand Menzies (2004). Blanchard & Schaffer (2017) present arguments\nagainst this approach. Glymour et al. (2010) raise a number of\nproblems for the project of trying to analyze actual causation.\n",
