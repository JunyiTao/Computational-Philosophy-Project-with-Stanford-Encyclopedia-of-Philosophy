    "main_text": "Risk and Uncertainty\n4. Risk and Uncertainty\n\nAnother set of normative issues arises from the fact that climate\nprojections are characterised by risk and uncertainty. A comprehensive\nanalysis of climate justice needs, then, to consider the just way to\nrespond to risk and uncertainty. To underscore why this matters it is\nsalutary to consider the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report. Suppose\nthat we take the appropriate target to be avoiding an increase in\nglobal mean temperatures of more than 1.5\u00b0C when compared with\npre-industrial times. The quantity of greenhouse gases that can be\npermissibly emitted varies enormously depending on how risk-averse we\nthink that our approach should be. According to the IPCC a 33%\nprobability of meeting the 1.5\u00b0C target results in a greenhouse\ngas budget of 840 GtCO2 whereas a 66% probability of\nmeeting the same target results in a greenhouse budget of 420\nGtCO2 (Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang 2019: 108). If we opt\nfor the more risk averse approach, then, the volume of greenhouse\ngases than can be permissibly emitted is half the size that the budget\nwould be if we opt for the less risk averse approach. One\nquestion that arises then is: How risk-averse should we be? How should\npolicy-makers treat risk and uncertainty?\n\nTwo approaches have been adopted.\n\nFirst, some employ traditional cost-benefit analysis and seek to\nderive the \u201cexpected value\u201d of different scenarios by\ncombining the probability of each state of affairs and its value and\nthen choosing that policy with the greatest expected value (Broome\n2012: 120\u2013132). Fleurbaey et al. (2019: 97\u2013100) provide an\nexcellent short analysis of this approach and variants of it. Some\nquery the validity of the \u201cexpected value\u201d approach on the\nbasis that our understanding of the future is so imperfect that we\nlack reliable probabilities (Gardiner 2011: 261\u2013263; though see\nBroome 2012: 127\u2013129).\n\nSecond, some adopt a version of the \u201cprecautionary\nprinciple\u201d. To introduce this principle it is helpful to turn to\nNeil Manson\u2019s excellent analysis of the precautionary principle\n(Manson 2002). Manson argues that all formulations of the\nprecautionary principle contain three elements. In particular they\ninclude what he terms \u201ca damage condition\u201d (this states\nwhat kinds of bad outcomes are relevant), a \u201cknowledge\ncondition\u201d (this states what kind of epistemic conditions are\nrequired\u2014is it uncertainty or a certain level of risk?) and a\n\u201cremedy\u201d (this states the right response) (Manson 2002:\n265). The central idea is that when people are engaged in a certain\nkind of action in which there is a prospect of harms of the relevant\nkind, and when our understanding of whether the harms will materialise\nsatisfies the knowledge condition, then it is appropriate to adopt a\nprecautionary policy (Manson 2002: esp. 265). Clearly, however, a\ngreat deal of work is needed to specify the three core\nfeatures\u2014how much harm and what kind of harm is relevant?; what\nepistemic conditions must hold?; what course of action is required\n(Manson 2002: 267)? \n\nIn his illuminating analysis of the precautionary principle Gardiner\nalso identifies three essential features. There is a \u201cthreat of\nharm\u201d; there is \u201c[u]ncertainty of impact and\ncausality\u201d; and third there is a \u201cprecautionary\nresponse\u201d (Gardiner 2006: 36). \n\nNow some interpretations of the basic idea will be unduly risk averse\n(Gardiner 2006: 37). Gardiner himself draws on Rawls\u2019s use of\nmaximin, and argues that we should prioritise avoiding very bad\noutcomes when the following conditions are all satisfied: (1) people face options with a variety of different outcomes (including some potentially dire ones) but cannot ascertain the probabilities of these outcomes so are in a state of \nuncertainty, (2) people do not care greatly about how much they are\nbetter off than \u201cthe minimum that can be guaranteed by the\nmaximin approach\u201d, and (3) people care greatly about not falling\nbeneath that minimum (Gardiner 2006: 47 & more generally\n45\u201349). Under such circumstances, Gardiner argues, it would not\nmake sense to take the risk of a dire outcome.\n\nA related (though not identical) approach is adopted by Shue, who\ndraws on Gardiner and Manson. Shue, like Gardiner, invokes three\nconditions. These are as follows:\n\n\n(1) massive loss: the magnitude of the possible losses is\nmassive; (2) threshold likelihood: the likelihood of the\nlosses is significant, even if no precise probability can be\nspecified, because (a) the mechanism by which the losses would occur\nis well understood, and (b) the conditions for the functioning of the\nmechanism are accumulating; and (3) non-excessive costs: the\ncosts of prevention are not excessive (a) in light of the magnitude of\nthe possible losses and (b) even considering the other important\ndemands on our resources. (Shue 2014: 265; footnote omitted) \n\n\nShue\u2019s claim, then, is that \n\n\n[w]here these three features are all present, one ought to try\nurgently to make the outcome progressively more unlikely until the\nmarginal costs of further efforts become excessive, irrespective of\nthe outcome\u2019s precise prior probability, which may not be known\nin any case. (Shue 2014:\n 265)[3]\n\n\nNote that the \u201cexpected value\u201d and the\n\u201cprecautionary\u201d approaches disagree, at a fundamental\nlevel, about the relevance of probabilities. The first one relies on\nthem to derive expected values, whereas the second does not rely on\nprecise probabilities. (Indeed, Gardiner\u2019s approach is intended\nto apply to cases of \u201cuncertainty\u201d [which is when we\ncannot specify probabilities] Gardiner [2006: 50].) This said, it\nseems likely that in practice they will converge, at least to some\nextent, in calling for aggressive mitigation policies.\n",
