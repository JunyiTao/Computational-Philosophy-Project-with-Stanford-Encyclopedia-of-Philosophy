This section briefly surveys the background to modern\nmethodological debates. What can be called the classical view goes\nback to antiquity, and represents a point of departure for later\n divergences.[1]\n\nWe begin with a point made by Laudan (1968) in his historical survey\nof scientific method:\n\n\nPerhaps the most serious inhibition to the emergence of the history of\ntheories of scientific method as a respectable area of study has been\nthe tendency to conflate it with the general history of epistemology,\nthereby assuming that the narrative categories and classificatory\npigeon-holes applied to the latter are also basic to the former.\n(1968: 5)\n\n\nTo see knowledge about the natural world as falling under knowledge\nmore generally is an understandable conflation. Histories of theories\nof method would naturally employ the same narrative categories and\nclassificatory pigeon holes. An important theme of the history of\nepistemology, for example, is the unification of knowledge, a theme\nreflected in the question of the unification of method in science.\nThose who have identified differences in kinds of knowledge have often\nlikewise identified different methods for achieving that kind of\nknowledge (see the entry on the\n unity of science).\n\nDifferent views on what is known, how it is known, and what can be\nknown are connected. Plato distinguished the realms of things into the\nvisible and the intelligible (The Republic, 510a, in Cooper\n1997). Only the latter, the Forms, could be objects of knowledge. The\nintelligible truths could be known with the certainty of geometry and\ndeductive reasoning. What could be observed of the material world,\nhowever, was by definition imperfect and deceptive, not ideal. The\nPlatonic way of knowledge therefore emphasized reasoning as a method,\ndownplaying the importance of observation. Aristotle disagreed,\nlocating the Forms in the natural world as the fundamental principles\nto be discovered through the inquiry into nature (Metaphysics\nZ, in Barnes 1984).\n\nAristotle is recognized as giving the earliest systematic treatise on\nthe nature of scientific inquiry in the western tradition, one which\nembraced observation and reasoning about the natural world. In the\nPrior and Posterior Analytics, Aristotle reflects\nfirst on the aims and then the methods of inquiry into nature. A\nnumber of features can be found which are still considered by most to\nbe essential to science. For Aristotle, empiricism, careful\nobservation (but passive observation, not controlled experiment), is\nthe starting point. The aim is not merely recording of facts, though.\nFor Aristotle, science (epist\u00eam\u00ea) is a body of\nproperly arranged knowledge or learning\u2014the empirical facts, but\nalso their ordering and display are of crucial importance. The aims of\ndiscovery, ordering, and display of facts partly determine the methods\nrequired of successful scientific inquiry. Also determinant is the\nnature of the knowledge being sought, and the explanatory causes\nproper to that kind of knowledge (see the discussion of the four\ncauses in the entry on\n Aristotle on causality).\n\nIn addition to careful observation, then, scientific method requires a\nlogic as a system of reasoning for properly arranging, but also\ninferring beyond, what is known by observation. Methods of reasoning\nmay include induction, prediction, or analogy, among others.\nAristotle\u2019s system (along with his catalogue of fallacious\nreasoning) was collected under the title the Organon. This\ntitle would be echoed in later works on scientific reasoning, such as\nNovum Organon by Francis Bacon, and Novum Organon\nRestorum by William Whewell (see below). In Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon reasoning is divided primarily into two forms, a\nrough division which persists into modern times. The division, known\nmost commonly today as deductive versus inductive method, appears in\nother eras and methodologies as analysis/\u200bsynthesis,\nnon-ampliative/\u200bampliative, or even\nconfirmation/\u200bverification. The basic idea is there are two\n\u201cdirections\u201d to proceed in our methods of inquiry: one\naway from what is observed, to the more fundamental, general, and\nencompassing principles; the other, from the fundamental and general\nto instances or implications of principles.\n\nThe basic aim and method of inquiry identified here can be seen as a\ntheme running throughout the next two millennia of reflection on the\ncorrect way to seek after knowledge: carefully observe nature and then\nseek rules or principles which explain or predict its operation. The\nAristotelian corpus provided the framework for a commentary tradition\non scientific method independent of science itself (cosmos versus\nphysics.) During the medieval period, figures such as Albertus Magnus\n(1206\u20131280), Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274), Robert\nGrosseteste (1175\u20131253), Roger Bacon (1214/1220\u20131292),\nWilliam of Ockham (1287\u20131347), Andreas Vesalius\n(1514\u20131546), Giacomo Zabarella (1533\u20131589) all worked to\nclarify the kind of knowledge obtainable by observation and induction,\nthe source of justification of induction, and best rules for its\n application.[2]\n Many of their contributions we now think of as essential to science\n(see also Laudan 1968). As Aristotle and Plato had employed a\nframework of reasoning either \u201cto the forms\u201d or\n\u201caway from the forms\u201d, medieval thinkers employed\ndirections away from the phenomena or back to the phenomena. In\nanalysis, a phenomena was examined to discover its basic explanatory\nprinciples; in synthesis, explanations of a phenomena were constructed\nfrom first principles.\n\nDuring the Scientific Revolution these various strands of argument,\nexperiment, and reason were forged into a dominant epistemic\nauthority. The 16th\u201318th centuries were a\nperiod of not only dramatic advance in knowledge about the operation\nof the natural world\u2014advances in mechanical, medical,\nbiological, political, economic explanations\u2014but also of\nself-awareness of the revolutionary changes taking place, and intense\nreflection on the source and legitimation of the method by which the\nadvances were made. The struggle to establish the new authority\nincluded methodological moves. The Book of Nature, according to the\nmetaphor of Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) or Francis Bacon\n(1561\u20131626), was written in the language of mathematics, of\ngeometry and number. This motivated an emphasis on mathematical\ndescription and mechanical explanation as important aspects of\nscientific method. Through figures such as Henry More and Ralph\nCudworth, a neo-Platonic emphasis on the importance of metaphysical\nreflection on nature behind appearances, particularly regarding the\nspiritual as a complement to the purely mechanical, remained an\nimportant methodological thread of the Scientific Revolution (see the\nentries on\n Cambridge platonists;\n Boyle;\n Henry More;\n Galileo).\n\nIn Novum Organum (1620), Bacon was critical of the\nAristotelian method for leaping from particulars to universals too\nquickly. The syllogistic form of reasoning readily mixed those two\ntypes of propositions. Bacon aimed at the invention of new arts,\nprinciples, and directions. His method would be grounded in methodical\ncollection of observations, coupled with correction of our senses (and\nparticularly, directions for the avoidance of the Idols, as he called\nthem, kinds of systematic errors to which na\u00efve observers are\nprone.) The community of scientists could then climb, by a careful,\ngradual and unbroken ascent, to reliable general claims.\n\nBacon\u2019s method has been criticized as impractical and too\ninflexible for the practicing scientist. Whewell would later criticize\nBacon in his System of Logic for paying too little attention\nto the practices of scientists. It is hard to find convincing examples\nof Bacon\u2019s method being put in to practice in the history of\nscience, but there are a few who have been held up as real examples of\n16th century scientific, inductive method, even if not in\nthe rigid Baconian mold: figures such as Robert Boyle\n(1627\u20131691) and William Harvey (1578\u20131657) (see the entry\non\n Bacon).\n\nIt is to Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727), however, that historians of\nscience and methodologists have paid greatest attention. Given the\nenormous success of his Principia Mathematica and\nOpticks, this is understandable. The study of Newton\u2019s\nmethod has had two main thrusts: the implicit method of the\nexperiments and reasoning presented in the Opticks, and the explicit\nmethodological rules given as the Rules for Philosophising (the\nRegulae) in Book III of the\n Principia.[3]\n Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, the linchpin of his new cosmology,\nbroke with explanatory conventions of natural philosophy, first for\napparently proposing action at a distance, but more generally for not\nproviding \u201ctrue\u201d, physical causes. The argument for his\nSystem of the World (Principia, Book III) was based on\nphenomena, not reasoned first principles. This was viewed (mainly on\nthe continent) as insufficient for proper natural philosophy. The\nRegulae counter this objection, re-defining the aims of natural\nphilosophy by re-defining the method natural philosophers should\nfollow. (See the entry on\n Newton\u2019s philosophy.)\n\nTo his list of methodological prescriptions should be added\nNewton\u2019s famous phrase \u201chypotheses non\nfingo\u201d (commonly translated as \u201cI frame no\nhypotheses\u201d.) The scientist was not to invent systems but infer\nexplanations from observations, as Bacon had advocated. This would\ncome to be known as inductivism. In the century after Newton,\nsignificant clarifications of the Newtonian method were made. Colin\nMaclaurin (1698\u20131746), for instance, reconstructed the essential\nstructure of the method as having complementary analysis and synthesis\nphases, one proceeding away from the phenomena in generalization, the\nother from the general propositions to derive explanations of new\nphenomena. Denis Diderot (1713\u20131784) and editors of the\nEncyclop\u00e9die did much to consolidate and popularize\nNewtonianism, as did Francesco Algarotti (1721\u20131764). The\nemphasis was often the same, as much on the character of the scientist\nas on their process, a character which is still commonly assumed. The\nscientist is humble in the face of nature, not beholden to dogma,\nobeys only his eyes, and follows the truth wherever it leads. It was\ncertainly Voltaire (1694\u20131778) and du Chatelet (1706\u20131749)\nwho were most influential in propagating the latter vision of the\nscientist and their craft, with Newton as hero. Scientific method\nbecame a revolutionary force of the Enlightenment. (See also the\nentries on\n Newton,\n Leibniz,\n Descartes,\n Boyle,\n Hume,\n enlightenment, as well as Shank 2008 for a historical overview.)\n\nNot all 18th century reflections on scientific method were\nso celebratory. Famous also are George Berkeley\u2019s\n(1685\u20131753) attack on the mathematics of the new science, as\nwell as the over-emphasis of Newtonians on observation; and David\nHume\u2019s (1711\u20131776) undermining of the warrant offered for\nscientific claims by inductive justification (see the entries on:\n George Berkeley;\n David Hume;\n Hume\u2019s Newtonianism and Anti-Newtonianism).\n Hume\u2019s problem of induction motivated Immanuel Kant\n(1724\u20131804) to seek new foundations for empirical method, though\nas an epistemic reconstruction, not as any set of practical guidelines\nfor scientists. Both Hume and Kant influenced the methodological\nreflections of the next century, such as the debate between Mill and\nWhewell over the certainty of inductive inferences in science.\n\nThe debate between John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) and William\nWhewell (1794\u20131866) has become the canonical methodological\ndebate of the 19th century. Although often characterized as\na debate between inductivism and hypothetico-deductivism, the role of\nthe two methods on each side is actually more complex. On the\nhypothetico-deductive account, scientists work to come up with\nhypotheses from which true observational consequences can be\ndeduced\u2014hence, hypothetico-deductive. Because Whewell emphasizes\nboth hypotheses and deduction in his account of method, he can be seen\nas a convenient foil to the inductivism of Mill. However, equally if\nnot more important to Whewell\u2019s portrayal of scientific method\nis what he calls the \u201cfundamental antithesis\u201d. Knowledge\nis a product of the objective (what we see in the world around us) and\nsubjective (the contributions of our mind to how we perceive and\nunderstand what we experience, which he called the Fundamental Ideas).\nBoth elements are essential according to Whewell, and he was therefore\ncritical of Kant for too much focus on the subjective, and John Locke\n(1632\u20131704) and Mill for too much focus on the senses.\nWhewell\u2019s fundamental ideas can be discipline relative. An idea\ncan be fundamental even if it is necessary for knowledge only within a\ngiven scientific discipline (e.g., chemical affinity for chemistry).\nThis distinguishes fundamental ideas from the forms and categories of\nintuition of Kant. (See the entry on\n Whewell.)\n\nClarifying fundamental ideas would therefore be an essential part of\nscientific method and scientific progress. Whewell called this process\n\u201cDiscoverer\u2019s Induction\u201d. It was induction,\nfollowing Bacon or Newton, but Whewell sought to revive Bacon\u2019s\naccount by emphasising the role of ideas in the clear and careful\nformulation of inductive hypotheses. Whewell\u2019s induction is not\nmerely the collecting of objective facts. The subjective plays a role\nthrough what Whewell calls the Colligation of Facts, a creative act of\nthe scientist, the invention of a theory. A theory is then confirmed\nby testing, where more facts are brought under the theory, called the\nConsilience of Inductions. Whewell felt that this was the method by\nwhich the true laws of nature could be discovered: clarification of\nfundamental concepts, clever invention of explanations, and careful\ntesting. Mill, in his critique of Whewell, and others who have cast\nWhewell as a fore-runner of the hypothetico-deductivist view, seem to\nhave under-estimated the importance of this discovery phase in\nWhewell\u2019s understanding of method (Snyder 1997a,b, 1999).\nDown-playing the discovery phase would come to characterize\nmethodology of the early 20th century (see\n section 3).\n\nMill, in his System of Logic, put forward a narrower view of\ninduction as the essence of scientific method. For Mill, induction is\nthe search first for regularities among events. Among those\nregularities, some will continue to hold for further observations,\neventually gaining the status of laws. One can also look for\nregularities among the laws discovered in a domain, i.e., for a law of\nlaws. Which \u201claw law\u201d will hold is time and discipline\ndependent and open to revision. One example is the Law of Universal\nCausation, and Mill put forward specific methods for identifying\ncauses\u2014now commonly known as Mill\u2019s methods. These five\nmethods look for circumstances which are common among the phenomena of\ninterest, those which are absent when the phenomena are, or those for\nwhich both vary together. Mill\u2019s methods are still seen as\ncapturing basic intuitions about experimental methods for finding the\nrelevant explanatory factors (System of Logic (1843), see\n Mill\n entry). The methods advocated by Whewell and Mill, in the end, look\nsimilar. Both involve inductive generalization to covering laws. They\ndiffer dramatically, however, with respect to the necessity of the\nknowledge arrived at; that is, at the meta-methodological level (see\nthe entries on\n Whewell\n and\n Mill\n entries).\n",
