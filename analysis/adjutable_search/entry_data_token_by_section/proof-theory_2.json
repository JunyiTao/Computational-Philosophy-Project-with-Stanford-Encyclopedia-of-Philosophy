    "main_text": "Proof Theory: A New Subject || Incompleteness and a Reduction\n1.2 Incompleteness and a Reduction \n\nIn 1931 G\u00f6del published a paper (1931a) that showed that there\nare true arithmetic statements that cannot be proved in the formal\nsystem of Principia Mathematica, assuming PM to be\nconsistent. His methods not only applied to PM but to any\nformal system that contains a modicum of arithmetic. A couple of\nmonths after G\u00f6del had announced this result at a conference in\nK\u00f6nigsberg in September 1930, von Neumann and G\u00f6del\nindependently realized that a striking corollary could be drawn from\nthe incompleteness theorem. Every consistent and effectively\naxiomatized theory that allows for the development of basic parts of\narithmetic cannot prove its own consistency. This came to be known as\nthe second incompleteness theorem. (For details on these\ntheorems and their history see\n appendix A.4)\n The second incompleteness theorem refutes the general ambitions of\nHilbert\u2019s program under the sole and very plausible assumption\nthat finitist mathematics is contained in one of the formal theories\nof arithmetic, analysis or set theory. As a matter of fact,\ncontemporary characterizations of finitist mathematics have elementary\narithmetic as an upper\n bound.[8]\n In response to G\u00f6del\u2019s result, Hilbert attempted in his\nlast published paper (1931b) to formulate a strategy for consistency\nproofs that is reminiscent of his considerations in the early 1920s\n(when thinking about the object theories as constructive) and clearly\nextends the finitist standpoint. He introduced a broad constructive\nframework that includes full intuitionist arithmetic and suggested\nextendibility of the new \u201cmethod\u201d to \u201cthe case of\nfunction variables and even higher sorts of variables\u201d. He also\nformulated a new kind of rule that allowed the introduction of a new\naxiom \\(\\forall x A(x)\\) as soon as all the numerical instances\n\\(A(n)\\) had been established by finitist proofs; in 1931 that is done\nfor quantifier-free \\(A(x)\\), whereas in 1931b that is extended to\nformulae of arbitrary complexity. The semi-formal calculi, which\narticulate the broader framework, are based on rules that reflect\nmathematical practice, but also define the meaning of logical\nconnectives. Indeed, Hilbert\u2019s reasons for taking them to be\nevidently consistent are expressed in a single sentence: \u201cAll\ntransfinite rules and inference schemata are consistent; for they\namount to definitions\u201d. Adding the tertium non datur in\nthe form  \n\n\\[{\\forall x A(x)} \\lor {\\exists x \\neg A(x)}\\]\n\n\nyields now the classical version of the theory and it is that addition\nthat has to be\n justified.[9]\n Hilbert\u2019s problematic considerations for this new\nmetamathematical step inspired Gentzen\u2019s\n\u201cUrdissertation\u201d when he began working in late 1931 on a\nconsistency proof for elementary\n arithmetic.[10]\n\n\nAs part of his \u201cUrdissertation\u201d, Gentzen had established\nby the end of 1932 the reduction of classical to intuitionist\narithmetic, a result that had also been obtained by G\u00f6del.\nGentzen\u2019s investigations led, finally in 1935, to his first\nconsistency proof for arithmetic. In the background was a normal form\ntheorem for intuitionist logic that will be discussed in the next\nsection together with Gentzen\u2019s actual dissertation and the\nspecial calculi he introduced there. Now we just formulate the\nGentzen-G\u00f6del result \u201cconnecting\u201d classical\nfirst-order number theory PA with its intuitionist\nversion HA. The non-logical principles of these\ntheories aim at describing \\(\\fN\\), the arguably most important\nstructure in mathematics, namely, Dedekind\u2019s simply infinite\nsystem \\(\\bbN\\) together with zero, successor, multiplication,\nexponentiation and the less-than relation:  \n\n\\[{\\fN}=(\\bbN; 0^{\\bbN}, S^{\\bbN},+^{\\bbN},\\times^{\\bbN},E^{\\bbN},<^{\\bbN}).\\]\n\n\nThey are formulated in the first-order language that has the relation\nsymbols =, <, the function symbols S, +, \\(\\times\\),\nE and the constant symbol 0. The axioms comprise the usual\nequations for zero, successor, addition, multiplication,\nexponentiation, and the less-than relation. In addition, the\ninduction principle is given by the schema \n\n\\[\\tag{IND}\n{F(0)} \\land {\\forall x[F(x)\\to F(Sx)]\\to \\forall x F(x)}\n\\]\n\n for\nall formulae \\(F(x)\\) of the language. These principles together with\nclassical logic constitute the theory of first order\narithmetic or first order number theory, also known as\nDedekind-Peano arithmetic, PA; together with\nintuitionist logic they constitute intuitionistic first order\narithmetic commonly known as Heyting-arithmetic,\nHA.\n\nNow we are considering the syntactic translation \\(\\tau\\) from the\ncommon language of PA and HA into\nits \u201cnegative\u201d fragment that replaces disjunctions\n\\(A\\lor B\\) by their de Morgan equivalent \\(\\neg (\\neg A\\land \\neg\nB)\\) and existential statements \\(\\exists x A(x)\\) by \\(\\neg \\forall\nx \\neg A(x)\\). The reductive result obtained by Gentzen and G\u00f6del\nin 1933 is now stated quite easily:\n\n\nTheorem 1.2\n\n\n\nPA proves the equivalence of A and \\(\\tau(A)\\)\nfor any formula A.\n\n\nIf PA proves A, then HA\nproves \\(\\tau(A)\\).\n\n\n\nFor atomic sentences like \\(1\\ne 1\\) the translation \\(\\tau\\) is\nclearly the identity, and the provability of \\(1\\ne 1\\) in\nPA would imply its provability in\nHA. Thus, PA is consistent relative\nto HA. This result is technically of great interest\nand had a profound effect on the perspective concerning the\nrelationship between finitism and intuitionism: finitist and\nintuitionist mathematics were considered as co-extensional; this\ntheorem showed that intuitionist mathematics is actually stronger than\nfinitist mathematics. Thus, if the intuitionist standpoint is taken to\nguarantee the soundness of HA, then it guarantees the\nconsistency of PA. The corresponding connection\nbetween classical and intuitionist logic had been established already\nby Kolmogorov (1925) who not only formalized intuitionist logic but\nalso observed the translatability of classical into intuitionist\nlogic. His work, though, seems not to have been noticed at the time or\neven in 1932, when Gentzen and G\u00f6del established their result for\nclassical and intuitionist arithmetic.\n\nThe foundational discussion concerning extended\n\u201cconstructive\u201d viewpoints is taken up in\n section 4.\n There, and throughout our paper the concepts of\n\u201cproof-theoretic reducibility\u201d and \u201cproof-theoretic\nequivalence\u201d will play a central role. The connection between\nPA and HA is paradigmatic and leads\nto the notion of proof-theoretic reduction. Before we can\nfurnish a precise definition, we should perhaps stress that many\nconcepts can be expressed in the language of PRA (as\nwell as PA) via coding, also known as G\u00f6del\nnumbering. Any finite object such as a string of symbols or an\narray of symbols can be coded via a single natural number in such a\nway that the string or array can be retrieved from the number when we\nknow how the coding is done. Typical finite objects include formulae\nin a given language and also proofs in a theory. Talk about formulae\nor proofs can then be replaced by talking about predicates of numbers\nthat single out the codes of formulae and proofs, respectively. We\nthen say that the concepts of formula and proof have been arithmetized\nand thereby rendered expressible in the language of\nPRA.\n\n\nDefinition 1.3 Let \\(\\bT_1\\), \\(\\bT_2\\) be a\npair of theories with languages \\(\\cL_1\\) and \\(\\cL_2\\), respectively,\nand let \\(\\Phi\\) be a (primitive recursive) collection of formulae\ncommon to both languages. Furthermore, \\(\\Phi\\) should contain the\nclosed equations of the language of PRA.\n\nWe then say that \\(\\bT_1\\) is proof-theoretically\n\\(\\Phi\\)-reducible to \\(\\bT_2\\), written\n\\(\\bT_1\\leq_{\\Phi}\\bT_2\\), if there exists a primitive recursive\nfunction f such that  \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n \\PRA\\vdash \\forall x \\forall y\\,[ {\\rform_{\\Phi}(x)} \\land {\\proof_{\\bT_1}(\ny,x)} \\rightarrow {\\proof_{\\bT_2}(f(y),x)}].\\]\n\n\nHere \\(\\rform_{\\Phi}\\) and \\(\\proof_{\\bT_i}\\) are arithmetized\nformalizations of \\(\\Phi\\) and the proof relation in \\(\\bT_i\\),\nrespectively, i.e., \\(\\rform_{\\Phi}(x)\\) expresses that x is\nthe G\u00f6del number of a formula in \\(\\Phi\\) while\n\\(\\proof_{\\bT_i}(y,x)\\) expresses that y codes a proof in\n\\(\\bT_i\\) of a formula with G\u00f6del number x.\n\n\\(\\bT_1\\) and \\(\\bT_2\\) are said to be proof-theoretically\n\\(\\Phi\\)-equivalent, written \\(\\bT_1\\equiv_{\\Phi}\\bT_2\\), if\n\\(\\bT_1\\leq_{\\Phi}\\bT_2\\) and \\(\\bT_2\\leq_{\\Phi}\\bT_1\\).\n\nThe appropriate class \\(\\Phi\\) is revealed in the process of reduction\nitself, so that in the statement of theorems we simply say that\n\\(\\bT_1\\) is proof-theoretically reducible to \\(\\bT_2\\)\n(written \\(\\bT_1\\leq \\bT_2\\)) and \\(\\bT_1\\) and \\(\\bT_2\\) are\nproof-theoretically equivalent (written \\(\\bT_1 \\equiv\n\\bT_2\\)), respectively. Alternatively, we shall say that \\(\\bT_1\\) and\n\\(\\bT_2\\) have the same proof-theoretic strength when\n\\(\\bT_1\\equiv \\bT_2\\). In practice, if \\(\\bT_1\\equiv \\bT_2\\) is shown\nvia proof-theoretic\n means[11]\n this always entails that the two theories prove at least the same\n\\(\\Pi^0_2\\) sentences (those of the complexity of the twin prime\nconjecture). The complexity of formulae of PRA is\nstratified as follows. The \\(\\Sigma^0_0\\) and \\(\\Pi^0_0\\) formulae are\nof the form \\(R(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)\\) where R is a predicate symbol\nfor an n-ary primitive recursive predicate. A formula is\n\\(\\Sigma^0_{k+1}\\) (\\(\\Pi^0_{k+1}\\)) if it is of the form \n\n\\[\n\\exists y_1\\ldots \\exists y_m\\,F(y_1,\\ldots,y_m) \n(\\forall y_1\\ldots \\forall y_m\\,F(y_1,\\ldots,y_m))\n\\]\n\n\nwith \\(F(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\) being of complexity \\(\\Pi^0_k\\)\n(\\(\\Sigma^0_k\\)). Thus the complexity of a formula is measured in\nterms of quantifier alternations. For instance \\(\\Pi^0_2\\)-formulae\nhave two alternations starting with a block of universal quantifiers\nor more explicitly they are of the shape  \n\n\\[\\forall x_1\\ldots\\forall x_n \\exists y_1\\ldots \\exists y_m\\,R(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\] \n\n\nwith R primitive recursive.\n\n",
