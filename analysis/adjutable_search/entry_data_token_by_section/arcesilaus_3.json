    "main_text": "Inapprehensibility and universal suspension of assent || The Non-Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n4.1 The Non-Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe NRNB view of Arcesilaus argues that he was not\ncommitted to inapprehensibility and universal\nsuspension, as a prescriptive claim about the\nirrationality of assent (see [7] in sect. 3). On this view, the two\nsources for the anti-Stoic arguments still imply that Arcesilaus was\n\u2018committed\u2019 to universal suspension, but this is\nunderstood as the descriptive claim that the skeptic does not\nassent to anything due to the balance of opposing arguments; and he was\ncommitted to it only in the sense that he acted in accordance with his\nunreflective impressions (see sect. 5.1 below). Thus, there is no\nconflict between the anti-Stoic sources, Sextus and Cicero, and those\nthat report that Arcesilaus\u2019 universal suspension is\ncaused by the equipollence of arguments without mentioning his\ncriticism of Stoic epistemology (viz., Diogenes Laertius 4.28, Cicero\nAcademica 1.45, & Sextus Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n1.232).\n\n\nThis interpretation takes Sextus to imply that Arcesilaus\u2019\ncommitment to a descriptive version of universal suspension is\nprior to his anti-Stoic argument (M. 7.156\u20137),\noutlined above in sect. 3 (see e.g., Ioppolo 2002; 2009). In this\nargument he holds that the Stoic who concedes the non-existence of\ncognitive impressions is forced to conclude that it is rational to\n\u2018withhold assent\u2019 (\u2018asugkatathetein\u2019)\nabout everything (see [10] below). This conclusion is sufficient to\noppose the Stoic thesis that some assents are rational. The full\nversion of the argument outlined in sect. 3 is:\n\nThere are no cognitive impressions, as Arcesilaus has argued.\n\n\nThe wise person does not hold \u2018opinions\u2019, i.e., assent\nto non-cognitive impressions, as the Stoics held.\nTherefore, the wise person does not assent to anything.\nIf one does not to assent to anything, one withholds assent\n(\u2018asugkatathetein\u2019) about everything.\nTo withhold assent is to suspend judgment\n(\u2018epechein\u2019).\nTherefore, the wise person suspends judgment about everything.\n\n\n\nThat Arcesilaus used premise [11] to move from withholding assent to\nthe suspension of judgment (\u2018epoch\u00ea\u2019)\nindicates, on this account, a commitment to epoch\u00ea that\nis independent of Stoic notions like assent and the irrationality of\nholding opinions, because it is reached only through the equipollence\nof arguments.\n\n\nThe NRNB view also interprets Cicero as confirming that\nArcesilaus was committed to the descriptive version of universal\nsuspension, even though Cicero Academica 2.66\u20137\n& 77 reports that Arcesilaus was committed to various components of\nhis anti-Stoic arguments (see sect. 3): that there are no cognitive\nimpressions, that nothing can be known, that it is irrational to hold\nopinions, and that it is rational to suspend assent. Cicero may be\nunreliable here, because he is biased by his own, later conception of\nradical skepticism, and in his text one may yet find an alternative\nview (see Ioppolo 2008): at Academica 2.32, Cicero\u2019s pro-Stoic\ncharacter Lucullus refers to skeptical Academics who concede that\neverything is uncertain (\u2018ad\u00eala\u2019) without\npreferring any views; and these Academics appear to be followers of\nArcesilaus (cf. Academica 2.16 & 59). Since these\nAcademics\u2019 suspension of judgment is based on the notion of\nuncertainty, which is not necessarily Stoic, their skeptical views do\nnot depend on an anti-Stoic critique.\n\n\nHowever, there are strong reasons not to read Sextus and Cicero as\nconfirming that Arcesilaus\u2019 commitment to a descriptive version\nof universal suspension is independent of his anti-Stoic\narguments. Even if Arcesilaus developed a notion of suspension\n(\u2018epoch\u00ea\u2019) before his criticisms of the\nStoa, premise [11] above conceptualizes it in Stoic terms. It is true\nthat Arcesilaus in Sextus M. 7.156\u20137 goes beyond the\npoint sufficient to oppose the Stoic\u2014viz., that the wise person\ndoes not assent to anything (see [9] above). But he continued the\nargument because there is a conceptual difference between not assenting\nand withholding assent (see e.g., Friedman 2013), and because\nepoch\u00ea refers to the latter. Withholding assent\npresupposes a prior examination of evidence and the recognition of an\nequipollence among the reasons for competing beliefs. (See also Maconi\n1988 and B\u00e9natou\u00efl 2011.) As for the evidence of Cicero,\neven if Lucullus thinks Arcesilaus himself belongs to the group of\nAcademics who say that everything is non-evident, he also accuses\nArcesilaus of appealing to the authority of Presocratics to promote his\nview of inapprehensibility, which crucially presupposes Stoic\nconditions on knowledge (Academica 2.15). So even Lucullus\nthinks Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism is related to his anti-Stoic\narguments.\n\n\nThere are further problems with the NRNB view, separate\nfrom the issues of interpretation mentioned above. For one, it narrowly\nrestricts the skeptic to a life of unreflective reaction (see sect.\n5.1), and therefore does not seem compatible with the patterns of\nrationality and inquiry that Arcesilaus engaged with. Its narrow\nrestriction on the scope of skeptical action is also overly dogmatic:\nwere the NRNB view true, it seems implausible Arcesilaus would\nsee the need for a theory of skeptical action, let alone use the\nStoic model of non-rational animals.\n",
