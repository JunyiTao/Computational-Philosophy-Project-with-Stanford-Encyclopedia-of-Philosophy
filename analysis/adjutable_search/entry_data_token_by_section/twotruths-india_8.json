    "main_text": "Yog\u0101c\u0101ra || Ultimate truth\n3.2 Ultimate truth\n\nIn the Commentary on the S\u016btra of Intent\n(\u0100rya-sa\u1e43dhinirmocana-s\u016btra, Mdo sde\nca 1b\u201355b) it is stated that \u201cReality as it is, which is\nthe intentional object of a pure consciousness, is the definition of\nthe perfect nature. This must be so because it is with respect to this\nthat the Victorious Buddha attributed all phenomena as natureless,\nultimately.\u201d (Mdo sde ca 35b) Vasubandhu\u2019s [TSN]\ndefines \u201cthe perfect nature (parini\u1e63panna) as the\neternal nonexistence of \u2018as it appears\u2019 of \u2018what\nappears\u2019 because it is unalterable.\u201d ([TSN] 3, Sems\ntsam chi 10a) \u201cWhat appears\u201d is the dependent\nnature\u2014a series of cognitive events, the representations.\n\u201cAs it appears\u201d is the imaginary nature\u2014the unreal\nconceptual fabrication of the subject-object duality. The\nrepresentations, (i.e., the dependent nature) appear in the cognition\nas if they have in them the subject-object duality, even though the\ndependent nature is wholly devoid of such subject-object duality. The\nperfect nature is therefore this eternal nonexistence of the imaginary\nnature\u2014the duality\u2014in the dependent nature.\n\nVasubandhu defines the perfect nature as the ultimate truth and\nidentifies it with mere-consciousness. \u201cThis is the ultimate\n(param\u0101rtha) of the dharmas, and so it is the reality\n(tathat\u0101) too. Because its reality is like this all the time, it\nis mere consciousness.\u201d (Tri\u1e43 25, Sems\ntsam shi 3b) Accordingly Sthiramati\u2019s Commentary on the\nThirty Verses (Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya\n[Tri\u1e43B], Sems tsam shi 146b\u2013171b), explains\n\u201cultimate\u201d (param\u0101rtha) here as referring to\n\u201c\u2019 world-transcending knowledge\u2019\n(lokottara-nirvikalpa-j\u00f1\u0101na) in that there is\nnothing that surpasses it. Since it is the object of [the transcendent\nknowledge], it is the ultimate. It is even like the space in having\nthe same taste everywhere. It is the perfect nature, which is\nstainless and unchangable. Therefore, it is known as the\n\u2018ultimate.\u2019\u201d ([Tri\u1e43B], Sems tsam shi\n169ab)\n\nSo, as we can see the dependent and the imaginary natures together\nexplain the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s conventional reality and the perfect\nnature explains its conception of the ultimate reality. The first two\nnatures provide an argument for the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s empirical and\npractical standpoints (vyavah\u0101ra), conventional truth and the\nthird nature an argument for its ultimate truth. Even then the\ndependent nature alone is conventionally real and the perfect nature\nalone is ultimately real. By contrast, the imaginary nature is unreal\nand false even by the empirical and practical standards. This is true\nin spite of the fact the imaginary nature is constitutive of the\nconventional truth.\n\nSo, the perfect nature\u2014nondual mind, i.e., emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) of the subject-object duality\u2014is the\nultimate reality of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra conception. Ultimate truth\ntakes various forms as it is understood within the Yog\u0101c\u0101rin\ntradition. As Maitreyan\u0101tha states, ultimate truth takes three\nprimary forms\u2014as emptiness it is the ultimate object, as\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a it is the ultimate attainment, and as nonconceptual\nknowledge it is the ultimate realization ([MVK], Sems tsam\nphi 42B).\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Arguments\n\nThe core argument in support of the only mind thesis is the\nimpossibility of the existence of external objects. Vasubandhu\ndevelops this argument in his Vi\u1e43 1\u201327 as does\nDign\u0101ga in his Examination of the Intentional Object\n(\u0100lambanapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101v\u1e5btti,\n\u0100PV 1\u20138, Tshad ma ce 86a\u201387b)\nagainst the atomists (Naiy\u0101yikas-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and\n \u0100bhidharmikas[8]).\n Against the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealist thesis the realist opponents,\nas Vasubandhu observes, raise three objections:\u2014\u201cIf\nconsciousness (does) not (arise) out from an object (i) neither the\ndetermination or certainty (niyama) in regard to place (de\u015ba) and\ntime (k\u0101la), (ii) nor the indetermination or unexclusiveness\n(aniyama) in regard to the series of (consciousness) (iii) nor the\nperformance of the (specific) function (k\u1e5btyakriya) are\nlogically possible (yukt\u0101)\u201d (Vi\u1e41 2, Sems\ntsam shi 3a).\n\nVasubandhu offers his Yog\u0101c\u0101ra reply in the\nVi\u1e43 to these realist objections and insists that the\nidealist position does not face these three problems. The first\nproblem is not an issue for the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra since dreams\n(svapna) account for the spatio-temporal determination. In dreams, in\nthe absence of an external object, one still has the cognition of a\nwoman, or a man in only determinate / specific time and place, and not\narbitrarily and not everywhere and not in any moment. Neither is the\nsecond problem of the lack of an intersubjective agreement an issue\nfor the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra. The case of the pretas (hungry-ghosts)\naccount for intersubjective agreement as they look at water they\nalone, not other beings, see rivers of pus, urine, excrement, and\ncollectively hallucinates demons as the hell guardians. Although pus,\nurine, excrement and hell guardians are nonexistent externally, due to\nthe maturation of their collective karma, pretas exclusively\nexperience the series of cognitions (vij\u00f1apti), other beings do\nnot encounter such experience (Vi\u1e43 3, Sems\ntsam shi). Nor is the lack of causal efficacy of the impressions\nor representations in the consciousness a problem for the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. As in the case of wet dreams, even without a union\nof the couple, the emission of semen can occur, and so the\nrepresentations in the consciousness are causally efficient even\nwithout the externally real object.\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s defensive arguments against the realist\nchallenges are quite strong. However unless Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is able\nto undermine the core realist thesis\u2014i.e., reality of the\nexternal objects\u2014and its key supporting argument\u2014the\nexistence of atoms\u2014then the debate could go either way.\nTherefore Yog\u0101c\u0101ra shows the nonexistence, or unreality of\nthe atoms as the basis of the external object to reject the realist\nposition.\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s impressions-only theory and the\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s representationalist theory both explain our sensory\nexperience (the spatio-temporal determinacy, intersubjective\nagreement, and causal efficacy). They agree on what the observables\nare: mental entities, including mental images but also emotions such\nas desires. They also agree that karma plays vital role in explaining\nour experience. The realist theory, though, according to\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s Investigation About the Support of the\nCognition (\u0100lambanapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101v\u1e5b\ntti [\u0100lamPV]) has to posit the reality of additional\nphysical objects, things that are in principle unobservable, given\nthat all we experience in the cognition are our impressions\n([\u0100lamPV], Tshad ma ce 86a).\n\nIf the realist thesis were correct, then there would be three\nalternatives for the atoms to act as the intentional objects of\ncognition.\n\nAtoms of the things would be either one in the way the\nNyya-Vaieika conceives the whole as something constituted by\nparts but being single, one, different from the parts that\ncompose it, and having a real existence apart from the existence of\nthe parts. Or\nthings would have to be constituted by multiple atoms\ni.e., a number or a group of atoms coexisting one besides the other\nwithout forming a composite whole as a result of mutual\ncohesion between the atoms. Or\nthings would have to be atoms grouped together,\nmassed together as a unity among themselves with a tight cohesion.\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra contends that these are the only three alternatives\nin which the reality of the external objects can functioning as the\nobjects of cognition.\n\n\nOf the three alternatives: (1) points to the unity of a thing\nconceived as a whole; and (2) and (3) point to the\nmultiplicity looking at the things as loose atoms, i.e.,\ncomposite atoms. Not one of the three possibilities is, on\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s account, admissible as the object of cognition\nhowever. The first is inadmissible because nowhere an external object\nis grasped as a unity, whole, one apart\nfrom its parts ([\u0100lamPV] Tshad ma ce 86b). The second is\ninadmissible because when we see things we find that the atoms are not\nperceived individually as one by one ([Vi\u1e43] 13, Sems\ntsam shi 3b). The third alternative is also rejected because the\natoms in this case cannot be proved to exist as an indivisible\n([Vi\u1e43] 14, Sems tsam shi 3b).\n\nFurther, if there were a simultaneous conjunction of an atom with\nother six atoms coming from the six directions, the atom would have\nsix parts because that which is the locus of one atom cannot be the\nlocus of another atom. If the locus of one atom were the locus of the\nsix atoms, which were in conjunction with it, then since all the seven\natoms would have the same common locus, the whole mass constituted by\nthe seven atoms would be of the size of a single atom, because of the\nmutual exclusion of the occupants of a locus. Consequently, there\nwould be no visible mass (Vi\u1e4312, Sems tsam shi\n3b).\n\nSince unity is an essential characteristic of being the whole, or\ncomposite whereas indivisibility an essential characteristic of being\nan atom when both the unity and individuality of the atoms are\nrejected, then the whole and indivisible atoms are no longer\nadmissible. Therefore, Vasubandhu sums up the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nobjections against the reality of the external sense-objects\n(\u0101yatanas) as: \u201cAn external sense-object is unreal because\nit cannot be the intentional object of cognition either as (1) a\nsingle thing or (2) as a multiple in [isolated] atoms; or (3) as a\naggregate because the atom is not proven to exist\u201d\n(Vi\u1e4311, Sems tsam shi 3b).\n\nThe realist insists that the external sense objects are real and that\ntheir reality is ascertained by the various means of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47as) of which perception (pratyak\u1e63a) is the\nmost important. If the external sense objects are nonexistents, there\ncan be no intentional objects, then cognition would not arise. Since\ncognitions do arise, there must be external objects as their\nintentional objects.\n\nTo this objection, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra employs two arguments to refute\nthe realist claim and to establish the mechanism of cognition, which\ntakes place without the atoms of an external object. The first\nargument shows that atoms do not satisfy the criterion of being the\nintentional object, therefore they do not cause the perception.\n\u201cPerceptual cognition [takes place] just like in dreams and the\nlike [even without an external object]; moreover, when that\n[cognition] occurs, the external object is not seen; how can it be\nthought that this is a case of perception?\u201d\n(Vi\u1e4316, Sems tsam shi 3b).\n\nThe second is the time-lag argument, according to which, there is a\ntime-gap between the perceptual judgement we make and the actual\nperceptual process. When we make a perceptual judgement, at that time\nwe do not perceive the external object as it is in our mental\nconsciousness (manovij\u00f1\u0101na) that carries out the judgement\nand since the visual consciousness that perceives the object has\nalready ceased. Hence at the time when the mental consciousness\ndelivers it judgment, the perceptual cognition no longer exists since\nall things are momentary. Therefore the atoms of an external object is\nnot the intentional object of perceptual cognition, since it has\nalready ceased and does not now exist therefore it is not responsible\nfor the cognition\u2019s having the content it has, like the unseen events\noccurring on the other side of the wall (Vasubandhu\u2019s\nVi\u1e43\u015batik\u0101-k\u0101rik\u0101v\u1e5btti\n[Vi\u1e43KV] 16\u201317).\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra therefore concludes that we cannot postulate the\nreality of an external object through direct perception. However since\nin perceptual cognition we are directly aware of something, there must\nbe an intentional object of the perceptual cognition. That intentional\nobject of perceptual cognition is, according to the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra, none other than the subliminal impressions\n(v\u0101san\u0101s) passing from their latent state contained in the\nstorehouse consciousness (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) to their\nconscious level. Therefore the impressions are the only things that\nare conventionally real.\n\nVasubandhu\u2019s [TSN] 35\u201336 inspired by the Buddhist traditional\nreligious beliefs also offers others arguments to defend the idealism\nof Yog\u0101c\u0101ra:\n\none and the same thing appears differently to beings that are in\ndifferent states of existence (pretas, men, and gods);\nthe ability of the bodhisattvas and\ndhy\u0101yins (practitioners of meditation) who have attained\nthe power of thinking (cetova\u015bit\u0101) to visualise\nobjects at will;\nthe capacity of the yogins who have attained serenity of\nmind (\u015bamatha) and a direct vision of dharmas as they\nreally are (dharma-vipa\u015byan\u0101) to perceive things at\nthe very moment of the concentration of mind\n(manasik\u0101ra) with their essential characteristics of\nflux, suffering, nonself, empty; and\nthe power of those who have attained intuitive knowledge\n(nirvikalpakaj\u00f1\u0101na) which enables them not to\nblock the perception of things.\n\n\nAll these arguments based on the facts of experience show that objects\ndo not exist really outside the mind, that they are products of mental\ncreation and that their appearance is entirely mind dependent.\nTherefore the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s theory of the two truths concludes\nthat the whole world is a product of mind\u2014it is the collective\nmental actions (karma) of all beings. All living beings see the same\nworld because of the identical maturation of their karmic\nconsequences. Since the karmic histories of beings are same, there is\nhomogeneity in the way in which the world is experienced and\nperceived. This is the reason there is an orderly world instead of\nchaotic and arbitrariness. This is also the reason behind the\nimpressions of the objectivity of the world.\n",
