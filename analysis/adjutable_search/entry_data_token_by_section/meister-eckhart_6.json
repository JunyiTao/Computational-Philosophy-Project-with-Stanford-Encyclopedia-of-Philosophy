Eckhart on God and Creation || The Boiling (Over) of Being: Eckhart\u2019s \u201cMetaphysics of Flow\u201d\n6.1 The Boiling (Over) of Being: Eckhart\u2019s \u201cMetaphysics of Flow\u201d\n\nIn his discussion of Exodus 3:14 (\u201cI am who I am\u201d),\nEckhart speaks of God as \u201cthe fullness of existence and full\nexistence [plenitudo esse et plenum esse]\u201d and\n\u201cnothing else but pure existence [nihil aliud nisi purum\nesse]\u201d (In Exod. n.74; LW II:77; TP 68). This\n\u201cpure naked existence [purum esse et nudum\nesse]\u201d, he maintains, is \u201cwithout any accident,\nwithout anything foreign, [pure] substance without quality, without\nthis or that form\u201d and is \u201cabove accident, species, and\ngenus\u201d (In Exod. n.15; LW II:21; TP 45\u20136).\nMoreover, like Avicenna, Aquinas, and most of his contemporaries, he\naffirms that God\u2019s qualityless existence is identical with\nGod\u2019s essence. Adapting for his own purposes the metaphors of\n\u201cboiling\u201d employed by scholastic thinkers like Albert the\nGreat and Dietrich of Freiburg, and drawing heavily on the mystical\nimagery of birthing, metalworking, liquid, light, and mirrors\nreminiscent of contemplative authors like Bernard of Clairvaux and\nMarguerite Porete, Eckhart writes:\n\n\n[\u2026] the repetition [in I am who I am] indicates\n[\u2026] a \u201cboiling\u201d or giving birth to itself\n[bullitionem sive parturitionem sui]\u2014glowing in itself,\nand melting and boiling in and into itself, light that totally forces\nits whole being in light and into light [lux in luce et in lucem\nse toto se totum penetrans] and that is everywhere totally turned\nback and reflected upon itself. (In Exod. n.16; LW\nII:21\u201322; EE 46)\n\n\nHe continues, citing John 1:4 (\u201cIn him was life\u201d):\n\n\n\u201cLife\u201d expresses a type of \u201cpushing out\u201d\n[exseritionem] by which something swells up in itself [in\nse intumescens] and first breaks out totally in itself [se\nprofundit primo in se toto], each part into each part, before it\npours itself forth and \u201cboils over\u201d on the outside\n[effundat et ebulliat extra]. (ibid.)\n\n\nEckhart\u2019s use here and elsewhere of bullitio\n(\u201cboiling\u201d) and ebullitio (\u201cboiling\nover\u201d) is central to his metaphysics of flow. The former term\nrefers to the timeless divine emanation of the Trinity within the\nGodhead. Put in terms of the transcendentals, the Father (here\nidentified with \u201cOneness\u201d or \u201cUnity\u201d)\neternally begets the Son (\u201cTruth\u201d or\n\u201cWisdom\u201d), and together they \u201cbreathe\u201d or\n\u201cspirate\u201d the Holy Spirit\n(\u201cLove\u201d/\u201cGoodness\u201d) (cp. In Sap.\nn.28; LW II:348; TP, 150). This \u201cinner boiling\u201d or\n\u201cswelling\u201d is, for Eckhart, a purely formal emanation. It\ndoes not result in any new beings but rather merely represents the\ninternal dynamism of the Godhead\u2014i.e., the eternal\n\u201cunfolding\u201d of the divine perfections within Godself. The\nlatter ebullitio, on the other hand\u2014the \u201cboiling\nover\u201d or \u201coutflowing\u201d of God\u2019s overabundant\nfullness of being into the world\u2014represents God\u2019s\nconstant, wholly free act of creation ex nihilo that not only\ngrounds the being of all creatures (as their formal cause) but also\ngives rise to their existence (as their efficient cause) and orders\nthem to their proper ends (as their final cause). Put in more\nNeoplatonist terms, it represents the Eckhartian version of the\nontological exitus\u2014the \u201cfall\u201d or\n\u201cdeparture\u201d from divine unity into created multiplicity.\nOn this view, only God has \u201ctrue being\u201d, and creatures\nare, strictly speaking, nothing. Since, for Eckhart,\n\u201cwhatever is outside of God, inasmuch as it is outside of being\nis not something else or [even] something at all\u201d (In\nIoh. n.215; LW III:181, quoted in Tobin 1986: 39), whatever being\ncreatures might be said to have is derivative of the puritas\nessendi that is the Godhead and wholly dependent on their\nparticipation in it.\n\nImportantly, according to the Meister, although God\u2019s inner\nboiling is conceptually prior to God\u2019s ebullitive act,\nand although the Father is logically prior to the Son and\nSpirit, there is no temporal distinction between the\nunfolding of the divine persons within Godself and the flowing out of\nthe universe from the Godhead (In Gen. I, n.7; LW I/2:65; EE\n84\u20135). When considered from the divine perspective, God\u2019s\ninward-directed activity of begetting and spirating Godself and\nGod\u2019s outward-directed activity of forming, birthing, and\nsustaining all of creation occur simultaneously in the \u201ceternal\nnow\u201d and might be said to constitute a single, unified,\nalways-occurring event of divine superabundance. However, viewed from\nour limited and finite human perspective, creation is conceived as a\ntemporal unfolding of the Trinitarian divine image in the\n\u201cflowing out\u201d (\u01d4zganc/uzfliessen) of\nBeing\u2014one which secondarily \u201cin-forms\u201d Truth and is\nultimately expressed in creation through the self-giving nature of\ndivine Love.\n",
