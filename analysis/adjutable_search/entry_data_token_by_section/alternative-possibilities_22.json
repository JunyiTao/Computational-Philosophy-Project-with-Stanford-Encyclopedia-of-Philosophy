    "main_text": "Beyond PAP || Replacement Principles\n5.3 Replacement Principles\n\nOne of the results of FSCs has been a long list of principles similar\nto PAP, but intended to improve on it. Some of these keep PAP\u2019s\nfocus on action, while others switch to responsibility for\nconsequences or omissions\n (\u00a71.2).\n This final section samples a few of these replacement principles.\n5.3.1 Responsibility for Actions\n\nThis entry assumes that PAP\u2019s proposed condition is intended to\nbe explanatory, not merely necessary for responsibility. (Not all\nnecessary conditions are explanatory, as any Euthyphro-style problem\nwill show.) That is, the intent of the principle is that when a person\nlacks alternatives, it is at least in part in virtue of this\nthat she is not morally responsible (Fischer 1994: 140; Pereboom 2001:\n25). As formulated, however, PAP seems too weak for this purpose, as\nit appears to allow any alternative action to meet its requirement.\nSuppose that when Kurt stole John\u2019s lunch, he had an\nalternative, but it was so remote from his mind, so irrelevant to his\ncircumstances, that he never considered it: Kurt could have sat down\nand whistled a tune. Although this is an alternative to stealing\nJohn\u2019s lunch, it is not the sort that could potentially explain\nhis responsibility. Thus finding PAP too weak, McKenna strengthens its\nrequirements:\n\n\nPAP-significant: a person is morally responsible for\nA-ing only if she could have performed some alternative action\nB such that (i) B-ing was in her control; (ii)\nB-ing is less morally bad than A-ing; and (iii) it would\nhave been reasonable by her lights for her to consider B-ing as\nan alternative to A-ing. (simplified from McKenna 2003:\n209)\n\n\nCondition (i) brings to mind the earlier discussion of robustness\n (\u00a74.2.2),\n but (iii) is the focus at the moment, as it shows why Kurt\u2019s\nsit-and-whistle alternative is not enough to ground his\nresponsibility: it was not reasonable for him to consider this as an\noption. McKenna rejects PAP as \u201ctoo inclusive\u201d, favoring\ninstead a principle with these more significant constraints. Having\nsaid that, he argues that even this improved principle falls to an\nFSC, one that, however, leaves open plenty of insignificant\nalternatives to assuage libertarian concerns (see Robinson 2014 for\ncritical discussion).\n\nOne apparent lesson from PAP-significant is that, contrary to the\nsimplifying assumption adopted at the outset of this entry, one cannot\ncleanly separate PAP\u2019s condition on moral responsibility from\nepistemic requirements (cp. Mele 2010). In particular, in order for\nalternatives to count as explanatory in the relevant sense, they must\nbe reasonable from the point of view of the agent. Similar\nentanglements arise when one considers PAP\u2019s historical clause\n (\u00a73.3;\n see, e.g., Ginet 1996; Ekstrom 2000: 211). Luther is responsible for\nhis defiant act even if he could not have at the time done otherwise.\nHis responsibility can be \u201ctraced\u201d to past self-forming\nchoices in which he could have done otherwise. If these are to help\nexplain his responsibility when brought before Charles V, it seems as\nif Luther must in the past have known, at least in broad outline, how\nthose choices would shape his future actions. But if there are such\nepistemic conditions in PAP\u2019s historical rider, there may be\nproblems looming, ordinary cases (not FSCs) in which a person is\nresponsible for her action at t, cannot at t do\notherwise, and yet whose responsibility cannot be traced to choices in\nthe past with the appropriate epistemic credentials. (See Vargas 2005,\nand for discussion, Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; Shabo 2015.)\n\nThere are other action-focused replacements for PAP worth considering.\nBut because action has been in play for most of this entry, the\nconcluding sub-sections look at responsibility for something other\nthan action: consequences and omissions.\n5.3.2 Responsibility for Consequences\n\nIt seems clear that sometimes we are responsible for the consequences\nof our actions (for dissent, see Frankfurt 1983). Recall that Meghan\nis responsible, not just for ruining Sean\u2019s tea by putting salt\nin it (an action), but for Sean\u2019s tea being ruined (a\nconsequence). Call this consequence a \u201cstate of affairs\u201d.\nPerhaps one can also be responsible for states of affairs that\naren\u2019t the consequences of action. A homeowner is responsible\nfor the dangerous sink hole developing in her back yard, not because\nof anything she did, but due simply to negligence. However one is to\ntreat such cases, they are here set aside to focus on states of\naffairs that are more clearly the consequences of actions. And not\nsurprisingly, there is a replacement for PAP explicitly about these\n(this principle and much of what follows is adapted from van Inwagen\n1978; cp. Ginet 1996: 403):\n\n\nPAP-consequences: a person is morally responsible for\na consequence of what she has done only if she could have prevented\nit.\n\n\nThis has as much initial appeal as PAP. If the result of what Meghan\ndid would have happened anyway\u2014if it was, for her,\ninevitable\u2014then it\u2019s hard to see how she could be praised\nor blamed for it. Indeed, the examples that support PAP\n (\u00a72.2)\n could also be adapted to support this new principle. If it\u2019s\ninappropriate to praise a person\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d\ndonation to a charity when it\u2019s caused by a compulsion to give\nthings away, it is also inappropriate to praise that person for the\nconsequence of this act, namely the charity\u2019s windfall. And the\nreason is that the donor could not have prevented this state of\naffairs from obtaining.\n\nMore relevant to present concerns, however, is that this replacement\nmay not be vulnerable to the examples that plague PAP. Return to our\ncentral FSC: It seems as if Jones is responsible for voting Republican\n(an action) because he does so on his own, for his own reasons. But\nnow consider a resulting state of affairs, say, the Republican\u2019s\nhaving one more vote. This would have obtained no matter what Jones\ndid, or failed to do, on his own. Due to Black, the obtaining of the\nstate of affairs is not (as Jones\u2019 action is) sensitive to how\nthings proceed with Jones\u2019 own deliberative processes. One thus\nloses any sense in which Jones is the author of the consequence, and\nwith it any sense in which he is responsible. This creates some space\nbetween PAP-Consequences and PAP, permitting the former to stand when\nthe latter falls.\n\nHere a state of affairs is a universal: whether Jones votes for a\nRepublican on his own or because of Black\u2019s intervention, one\nand the same consequence obtains. In this way, the object of moral\nappraisal (the state of affairs) doesn\u2019t turn on how things\nactually go for Jones. But matters look different if the consequence\nis instead construed as a concrete particular, something produced by\nJones in the actual scenario. In that case, PAP-consequences looks\nvulnerable to FSCs in just the same way PAP is. When Jones votes for\nthe Republican, the particular consequence\u2014that event\nof one vote\u2019s being cast for a Republican\u2014seems to be\nsomething Jones produced on his own, and is thus responsible for.\n(Whether numerically the same event would have obtained in the\ncounterfactual scenario is a controversial issue, one whose resolution\ncould yield a version of the \u201cflicker\u201d strategy considered\nin\n \u00a74.2.2.)\n Let us in any case continue to assume that a consequence is a\n(universal) state of affairs.\n\nEven under this assumption, might this replacement fall to FSCs? The\nabove defense suggests not, but this has not prevented philosophers\nfrom trying, and with a variety of examples (e.g., Heinaman 1986; Rowe\n1989; Klein 1990: ch. 2; Fischer & Ravizza 1998: ch. 4). Here is\none thought to motivate such a project: Even if a consequence of an\nagent\u2019s action was inevitable, we can still make sense of her\ncausing that state of affairs to obtain, which thus looks like the\nresult of something she did, even if it would have obtained anyway.\nPerhaps this is enough to make the state of affairs sensitive to the\nactual sequence by which it was produced, grounding the agent\u2019s\nmoral responsibility, as an FSC requires. Rowe (1989), for example,\nimagines you are on a train headed down Track 2, a track that leads to\na safe stopping point. If you throw a switch, the train will go onto\nanother track, Track 1, on which a dog is tied. Unbeknownst to you,\nthere is someone (Peter) who is poised to throw that switch if you\ndon\u2019t. As it turns out, you throw the switch on your\nown\u2014Peter doesn\u2019t act at all\u2014and the train goes down\nTrack 1, killing the dog. Rowe says you caused the dog\u2019s death\nand are in fact morally responsible for it. (As usual, assume other\nstandard requirements are met.) Yet that consequence, the dog\u2019s\ndeath, was inevitable: there was nothing you could have done to\nprevent it. (For a successor to PAP-consequences, one that may handle\npotential counterexamples more easily, see Sartorio 2012.)\n5.3.3 Responsibility for Omissions\n\nSometimes a person is responsible for not acting: Blame Luke\nthe indifferent lifeguard for failing to save the drowning swimmer.\nCredit Emily for not cheating on a test. Let us formulate one more\nreplacement for PAP, using \u201comission,\u201d broadly, for any\nfailure to act:\n\n\nPAP-omissions: a person is morally responsible for\nwhat she didn\u2019t do only if she could have done it.\n\n\nAccording to this new principle, if the waters were too treacherous\nfor a rescue, Luke is blameless for his failure. (He may still be\nresponsible for failing to try, or for failing to call for help.)\nSimilarly, Emily is responsible for not cheating only if she could\nhave done so. If, due to a fear of being caught, she was unable to\ncheat, or if the means to cheat were simply unavailable to her, she\ncould not be credited for her omission, at least not on that occasion.\nPAP-omissions is here treated as its own stand-alone principle, though\nthere is some metaphysics behind such an assumption (Clarke 2012; S.\nBernstein 2015). The present question is whether it can survive the\ndemise of PAP.\n\nIt appears not, for this replacement looks vulnerable to many of the\nsame arguments\n (\u00a73).\n But to test this alleged symmetry, focus in particular on whether an\nFSC can be constructed as a counterexample to PAP-omissions (van\nInwagen 1978, 204\u20135): Bob sees a man being robbed and beaten\noutside of his house. After considering whether to call the police,\nBob decides not to get involved, calculating that it wouldn\u2019t be\nworth the trouble. For his own reasons, then, Bob refrains from\ncalling the police. What Bob didn\u2019t know, however, is that the\ndue to a technology disaster, all of the phones in the city are out of\norder and will be for hours. It seems then that Bob isn\u2019t\nresponsible for failing to call the police. And plausibly,\nPAP-omissions explains why he\u2019s off the hook: due to the\ntelephone disaster, he could not have called the police. (He might\nstill be responsible for failing to try to call the police, but trying\nis something he could have done.) Given the present assumption that\nPAP is false, what emerges from such examples is, contrary to initial\nappearances, an important asymmetry: \n\n\nmoral responsibility for an action does not require the freedom to\nrefrain from performing the action, whereas moral responsibility for\nfailure to perform an action requires the freedom to perform the\naction. (Fischer & Ravizza 1991: 262, with similar examples; they\nlater retract the asymmetry claim)\n\n\nHere\u2019s one try at explaining this asymmetry (Fischer\n1985\u201386: 267\u2013268): moral responsibility for\nanything\u2014action, consequence, omission\u2014requires a certain\nkind of control, though what kind of control is needed may vary\ndepending on the case. Now grant that FSCs show, contra PAP, that\nregulative control\n (\u00a75.1)\n isn\u2019t required for responsibility for actions: guidance control\nis enough (assuming other conditions on moral responsibility are met).\nWhen omissions are in play, however, there is no potential object of\nguidance control, for there is nothing to guide. For omissions, the\nonly kind of control available to satisfy the control requirement is\nregulative control. No wonder then that FSCs fail to refute\nPAP-omissions, as these cases remove the only sort of control one\ncould have over an omission.\n\nThat said, not everyone grants the claimed asymmetry. Both PAP and\nPAP-omissions should fall together (Frankfurt 1994; Glannon 1995;\nFischer & Ravizza 1998: ch. 5; or stand together: Swenson 2016).\nConsider one final FSC, this time bringing the omission inside to the\n\u201clocus of responsibility\u201d: a choice (or in this case, the\nlack of one). Luke the indifferent lifeguard fails to save the\nswimmer, and indeed fails even to try, for reasons entirely his own:\nhe\u2019s lazy and indifferent. But now add that unbeknownst to Luke,\nhad he even considered saving the swimmer, he would have been\nparalyzed by an overwhelming fear, compelling him to remain inactive,\nnot even choosing or trying to save the swimmer. Here there is no\noverdetermination, for the fear and the underlying pathology remain\ndormant in the actual scenario: the only causal factors relevant to\nthe omission are Luke\u2019s own cognitive states and values, which\nappear to exert a kind of responsibility-relevant control over his\nfailure. This looks like a genuine FSC, and, if so, a counterexample\nto PAP-omissions.
