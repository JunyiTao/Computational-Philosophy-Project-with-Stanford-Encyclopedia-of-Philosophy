    "main_text": "Philosophical ideas || Paraphrasing and interpolating\n4.1 Paraphrasing and interpolating\nSince the Arabic Plotinus is first and foremost just that\u2014an Arabic version of Plotinus\u2014philosophical ideas are primarily introduced into the text by means of subtle, but deliberate, variation from the original text. Here is a particularly clear example, juxtaposing the first sentences of Enneads V.2 and of the tenth chapter of the Theology:\n\nThe One is all things and no one of them (to hen panta kai oude hen) (Plotinus, Enneads V.2.1.1).\nThe pure One is the cause of all things and is not like any of them (Theology of Aristotle, Badawi 1955, 134).\n\nHere the notion of \u2018cause\u2019 and the idea that the One is not \u2018like (ka-)\u2019 its effects are worked into the translation. The translation is still true to Plotinus\u2019 thought. Indeed, in what immediately follows both Plotinus and the Arabic describe the One as a \u2018principle,\u2019 which in the Arabic becomes a kind of gloss on calling it a \u2018cause\u2019. Yet the changes soften the paradoxical effect of this opening sentence (which is itself based on Plato\u2019s Parmenides, 160B). Nor is this an isolated case. We frequently find interesting, if subtle, changes introduced in the way that Plotinus is translated.\nA more obvious sort of change comes in the form of interpolated excurses that have no direct basis in the Greek. A good example is found at the conclusion of the first mimar of the Theology (Badawi 1955, 27\u20138). This interpolation defends a \u2018non-literal\u2019 understanding of Plato\u2019s account of the creation of the physical universe. We are told that, although Plato speaks as if the world came into being with a first moment of time, actually this is misleading. He speaks in this fashion only because of the difficulty of expressing causal priority without expressions that imply temporal priority. The passage would seem to relate to ancient Platonist treatments of the Timaeus, though that text is not mentioned explicitly here (for the Arabic Plotinus and Timaeus see D\u2019Ancona 2003).\nAgain, this raises questions about the provenance of the text. Despite the continuity of vocabulary and style between the paraphrase and the interpolations, one cannot exclude the possibility that the interpolations are the work of a different author than the paraphrase. The interpolation just mentioned is particularly intriguing, since the non-temporal account of creation would fit badly with al-Kindi\u2019s well-known rejection of the eternity of the world (Adamson 2007a, ch.4).\n",
