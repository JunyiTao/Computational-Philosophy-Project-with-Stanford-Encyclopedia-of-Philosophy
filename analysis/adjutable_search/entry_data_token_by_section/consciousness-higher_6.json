    "main_text": "Objections to a Higher-Order Approach\n7. Objections to a Higher-Order Approach\n\nThere have, of course, been a whole host of objections raised against\nhigher-order theories of phenomenal consciousness over the years.\n(See, e.g., Aquila 1990; Jamieson and Bekoff 1992; Dretske 1993, 1995;\nGoldman 1993, 2000; G\u00fczeldere 1995; Tye 1995; Chalmers 1996;\nByrne 1997; Siewert 1998; Levine 2001; Rowlands 2001; Seager 2004;\nBlock, 2011.) Many of these objections, although perhaps intended as\nobjections to higher-order theories as such, are often framed in terms\nof one or another particular version of such a theory. A general moral\nto be taken away from the present discussion should then be this: the\ndifferent versions of a higher-order theory of phenomenal\nconsciousness need to be kept distinct from one another, and critics\nshould take care to state which version of the approach is under\nattack, or to frame objections that turn merely on the\nhigher-order character of all of these approaches. I shall discuss a few\n\u2018local\u2019 objections first, before discussing some generic\nones.\n",
