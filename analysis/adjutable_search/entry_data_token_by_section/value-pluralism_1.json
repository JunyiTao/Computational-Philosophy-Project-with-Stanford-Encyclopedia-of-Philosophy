    "main_text": "Some Preliminary Clarifications || A Purely Verbal Dispute?\n1.2 A Purely Verbal Dispute?\n\nOne final clarification about different understandings of pluralism\nought to be made. There is an ambiguity between the name for a group\nof values and the name for one unitary value. There are really two\nproblems here: distinguishing between the terms that refer to groups\nand the terms that refer to individuals (a merely linguistic problem)\nand defending the view that there really is a candidate for a unitary\nvalue (a metaphysical problem). The linguistic problem comes about\nbecause in natural language we may use a singular term as\n\u2018shorthand\u2019: conceptual analysis may reveal that surface\ngrammar does not reflect the real nature of the concept. For example,\nwe use the term \u2018well-being\u2019 as if it refers to one single\nthing, but it is not hard to see that it may not.\n\u2018Well-being\u2019 may be a term that we use to refer to a group\nof things such as pleasure, health, a sense of achievement and so on.\nA theory that tells us that well-being is the only value may only be\nnominally monist. The metaphysical question is more difficult, and\nconcerns whether there are any genuinely unitary values at all.\n\nThe metaphysical question is rather different for naturalist and\nnon-naturalist accounts of value. On Moore\u2019s non-naturalist\naccount, goodness is a unitary property but it is not a natural\nproperty: it is not empirically available to us, but is known by a\nspecial faculty of intuition. It is very clear that Moore thinks that\ngoodness is a genuinely unitary property:\n\n\u2018Good\u2019, then, if we mean by it that quality which we\nassert to belong to a thing, when we say that the thing is good, is\nincapable of any definition, in the most important sense of that word.\nThe most important sense of \u2018definition\u2019 is that in which\na definition states what are the parts which invariably compose a\ncertain whole; and in this sense \u2018good\u2019 has no definition\nbecause it is simple and has no parts. (Moore, 1903, p. 9)\n\n\nThe question of whether there could be such a thing is no more easy or\ndifficult than any question about the existence of non-natural\nentities. The issue of whether the entity is genuinely unitary is not\nan especially difficult part of that issue.\n\nBy contrast, naturalist views do face a particular difficulty in\ngiving an account of a value that is genuinely unitary. On the goods\napproach, for example, the claim must be that there is one good that\nis genuinely singular, not a composite of other goods. So for example,\na monist hedonist must claim that pleasure really is just one thing.\nPleasure is a concept we use to refer to something we take to be in\nthe natural world, and conceptual analysis may or may not confirm that\npleasure really is one thing. Perhaps, for example, we refer both to\nintellectual and sensual experiences as pleasure. Or, take another\ngood often suggested by proponents of the goods approach to value,\nfriendship. It seems highly unlikely that there is one thing that we\ncall friendship, even if there are good reasons to use one umbrella\nconcept to refer to all those different things. Many of the plausible\ncandidates for the good seem plausible precisely because they are very\nbroad terms. If a theory is to be properly monist then, it must have\nan account of the good that is satisfactorily unitary.\n\nThe problem applies to the deontological approach to value too. It is\noften relatively easy to determine whether a principle is really two\nor more principles in disguise\u2014the presence of a conjunction or\na disjunction, for example, is a clear giveaway. However, principles\ncan contain terms that are unclear. Take for example a deontological\ntheory that tells us to respect friendship. As mentioned previously,\nit is not clear whether there is one thing that is friendship or more\nthan one, so it is not clear whether this is one principle about one\nthing, or one principle about several things, or whether it is really\nmore than one principle.\n\nQuestions about what makes individuals individuals and what the\nrelationship is between parts and wholes have been discussed in the\ncontext of metaphysics but these issues have not been much discussed\nin the literature on pluralism and monism in moral philosophy.\nHowever, these issues are implicit in discussions of the well-being,\nnature of friendship and pleasure, and in the literature on\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative, or on Aristotelian accounts of\neudaimonia. Part of an investigation into the nature of these things\nis an investigation into whether there really is one thing or not.\n [7]\n\nThe upshot of this brief discussion is that monists must be able to\ndefend their claim that the value they cite is genuinely one value.\nThere may be fewer monist theories than it first appears. Further, the\nmonist must accept the implications of a genuinely monist view. As\nRuth Chang points out, (2015, p. 24) the simpler the monist\u2019s\naccount of the good is, the less likely it is that the monist will be\nable to give a good account of the various complexities in choice that\nseem an inevitable part of our experience of value. But on the other\nhand, if the monist starts to admit that the good is complex, the view\ngets closer and closer to being a pluralist view.\n\nHowever, the dispute between monists and pluralists is not merely\nverbal: there is no prima facie reason to think that there are no\ngenuinely unitary properties, goods or principles.\n",
