    "main_text": "Trust and the Will\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry as a whole has examined an important practical question\nabout trust: \u201cWhen is trust warranted?\u201d Also woven into\nthe discussion has been some consideration of when distrust is\nwarranted. Centerstage has been given to trust, however, because\nphilosophers have debated it much more than distrust.\n\nDifferent answers to the question of when trust is warranted give rise\nto different philosophical puzzles. For example, in response, one\ncould appeal to the nature of trust and trustworthiness and consider\nwhether the conditions are ripe for them (e.g., for the proposed\ntrustor to rely on the trustee\u2019s competence). But one would\nfirst have to settle the difficult issue of what trust and\ntrustworthiness are, and more specifically, how they differ from mere\nreliance and reliability, assuming there are these differences.\n\nAlternatively, in deciding whether trust is warranted, one could\nconsider whether trust would be rationally justified or valuable. One\nwould consider these things simultaneously when rational justification\nis understood in an end-directed way, making it dependent on\ntrust\u2019s instrumental value. With respect to rational\njustification alone, puzzles arise when trying to sort out whether\nreasons for trust must be internal to trustors or could be external to\nthem. In other words, is trust\u2019s epistemology internalist or\nexternalist? Because good arguments exist on both sides, it\u2019s\nnot clear how trust is rationally justified. Neither is it entirely\nclear what sort of value trust can have, given the nature of it. For\nexample, trust may or may not have intrinsic moral value depending on\nwhether it signals respect for others.\n\nLastly, one might focus on the fact that trust cannot be warranted\nwhen it is impossible, which is the case when the agent does not\nalready exhibit trust and cannot simply will themselves to have it.\nWhile trust is arguably not the sort of attitude that one can just\nwill oneself to have, trust can be cultivated. The exact manner or\nextent to which it can be cultivated, however, may depend again on\nwhat sort of mental attitude it is.\n\nSince one can respond to the question, \u201cWhen is trust\nwarranted?\u201d by referring to each of the above dimensions of\ntrust, a complete philosophical answer to this question is complex.\nThe same is true about the question of when to distrust, because the\nsame dimensions (the epistemology of distrust, its value, etc.) are\nrelevant to it. Complete answers to these broad questions about trust\nand distrust would be philosophically exciting and also socially\nimportant. They would be exciting both because of their complexity and\nbecause they would draw on a number of different philosophical areas,\nincluding epistemology, philosophy of mind, and value theory. The\nanswers would be important because trust and distrust that are\nwarranted contribute to the foundation of a good society, where people\nthrive through healthy cooperation with others, become morally mature\nhuman beings, and are not subject to social ills like tyranny or\noppression.\n",
