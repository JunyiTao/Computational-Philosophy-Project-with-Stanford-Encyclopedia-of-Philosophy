    "main_text": "Varieties of Perceptual Learning\n2. Varieties of Perceptual Learning\n\nThe psychology literature provides ample evidence of perceptual\nlearning. Goldstone (1998) helpfully distinguishes between four\ndifferent types of perceptual learning in the literature:\ndifferentiation, unitization, attentional weighting, and stimulus\nimprinting. This section surveys these four types of perceptual\nlearning (for further review, see Goldstone 2003; Goldstone,\nBraithwaite, & Byrge 2012; and Goldstone & Byrge 2015).\n",
