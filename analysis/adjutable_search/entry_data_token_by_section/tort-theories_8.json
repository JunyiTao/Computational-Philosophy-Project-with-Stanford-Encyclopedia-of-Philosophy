    "main_text": "Contemporary Philosophical Approaches to Tort Law || Fairness Theories\n4.6 Fairness Theories\n\nOther writers have proposed different justice-based accounts of the\ncommon law of torts. George Fletcher proposed to understand tort\nliability as a violation of reciprocity; those who impose\nnon-reciprocal risks on others must compensate for the harm that they\ndo (1972). Other writers, drawing on John Rawls\u2019s theory of\njustice have proposed to understand tort law in broadly contractarian\nterms. For example, Gregory Keating has argued that corrective justice\nis a subordinate principle in tort law, the purpose of which is to\nuphold entitlements\u2014not only to property but also to personal\nsecurity\u2014that are themselves the product of a contractualist\nprocedure (1996; 1997). Keating argues that corrective justice\u2019s\nemphasis on the form of a tort action attends to remedies without\nadequately accounting for the way in which those remedies are\nsecondary to the rights that they enforce. In order to identify the\nrelevant rights, Keating suggests a contractualist procedure similar\nto those developed by Rawls and T.M. Scanlon. The proposed\ncontractualist account would weigh the substantive interests of people\nin liberty and security, and would attach priority to bodily security\nin particular. It would therefore require two things. First, it would\nrequire that business enterprises that characteristically create risks\nto life and limb spend more on precautions than would be justified\nthrough an economic analysis of their expected costs and benefits.\nSecond, it would require that those who suffer injuries, even if those\ninjuries are unavoidable\u2014as is likely in a world in which, as\nHolmes puts it, enterprises engaged in ongoing\n\u201cactivities\u201d rather than isolated \u201cacts\u201d on a\nlarge scale will inevitably produce injuries no matter how careful\nthey are\u2014receive compensation even though nothing short of\nprohibiting those worthwhile and beneficial activities could have been\ndone to prevent those injuries. Keating puts this point in terms of an\nidea of enterprise liability under which an enterprise that imposes\ncosts on others should properly be made to bear those costs.\nEnterprise liability, in which manufacturers were required to insure\nagainst all injuries caused by their products, even those that could\nnot be prevented through further care figured prominently in a number\nof decisions, particularly in California, in the second half of the\ntwentieth century. A leading case involved a cola bottle that\nexploded, injuring the plaintiff, although there was no evidence of\nnegligent manufacture. In recent decades, the prominence of enterprise\nliability has largely faded.\n\nLike some versions of economic analysis, Keating\u2019s social\ncontract account is avowedly normative, proposing significant changes\nto tort doctrine. Like economic analysis, it sees tort law as one of\nmany tools available to the state in dealing with safety (2021). It\ndiffers from economic analysis in the greater weight that it proposes\nto give to personal safety rather than convenience. Ultimately,\nhowever, it engages in the same type of balancing, and appears to be\nvulnerable to the interpretive objections that are frequently raised\nagainst economic analysis, in particular, that it leaves no place for\nsome of tort law\u2019s most familiar doctrinal structures, such as\nthe relational structure of wrongdoing and the distinction between\nwronging someone and failing to confer a benefit on that person. For\nexample, the priority attached to safety over convenience or\nprofit-making applies not only to the taking of precautions but to\nassisting others who are endangered by natural perils; the same\nweighted cost/benefit analysis would seem to apply to the person who\ncould make an easy rescue or, more generally, provide benefits to\nothers. However morally meritorious such acts might be, and whatever\nmight be said in favor of other forms of regulation mandating them,\nthey are incongruous with the way in which tort law frames issues of\ninterpersonal interaction.\n",
