    "main_text": "Explanation, Prediction, Retrodiction || The Symmetry Thesis\n5.1 The Symmetry Thesis\n\nStudents of Hempel have found it very difficult to avoid the\nimpression that Hempel was not only defending the position that every\nadequate scientific explanation is potentially predictive but also the\nposition that every adequate scientific prediction is potentially\nexplanatory. This impression is powerfully reinforced in \u201cThe\nTheoretician\u2019s Dilemma\u201d (Hempel 1958), where, in the\ncourse of demonstrating that the function of theories goes beyond\nmerely establishing connections between observables, he offers this\npassage:\n\n\nScientific explanations, predictions, and postdictions all have the\nsame logical character: they show that the fact under consideration\ncan be inferred from certain other facts by means of specified general\nlaws. In the simplest case, the type of argument may be schematized as\na deductive inference of the following form [here substituting the\n\u201csimplest case\u201d for the abstract schemata presented in the\noriginal]:\n\n\n\n\n\\((x)(Rx \\supset Bx)\\)\nExplanans \n\n\\(Rc\\)\n\n\n\\(Bc\\)\nExplanandum  \n\n\nFigure 4. A Covering-Law Explanation\n\n\n\u2026 While explanation, prediction, and postdiction are alike in\ntheir logical structure, they differ in certain other respects. For\nexample, an argument [like Figure 4 above] will qualify as a\nprediction only if [its explanandum] refers to an occurrence at a time\nlater than that at which the argument is offered; in the case of\npostdiction, the event must occur before the presentation of the\nargument. These differences, however, require no further study here,\nfor the purpose of the preceding discussion was simply to point out\nthe role of general laws in scientific explanation, prediction, and\npostdiction (Hempel 1958: 37\u201338).\n\n\nWhat is crucial about this passage is Hempel\u2019s emphasis on the\npragmatic consideration of the time at which the argument is\npresented in relation to the time of occurrence of the\nexplanandum event itself. Let us take this to be the observation\nthat \\(c\\) is black and assume that occurs at a\nspecific time \\(t_1\\). If the argument is presented prior to time\n\\(t_1\\) (before observing that \\(c\\) is black), then it\nis a prediction. If the argument is presented after time \\(t_1\\)\n(after observing that \\(c\\) is black), then it is a\npostdiction. Since explanations are usually advanced after the time of\nthe occurrence of the event to be explained, they usually occur as\npostdictions. But there is nothing about their form that requires\nthat.\n\nAs Hempel uses the term, reasoning is \u201cscientific\u201d when it\ninvolves inferences with laws. Indeed, this appears to be the\nprincipal ground upon which he wants to maintain that explanations,\npredictions, and postdictions share the same logical form. His\nposition here makes it logically impossible for explanations,\npredictions and postdictions to not have the same logical form. If\nthere are modes of prediction that are non-explanatory, such as might\nbe the case when they are based upon accidental generalizations, then\nthey would not thereby demonstrate that the symmetry thesis does not\nhold for the kinds of distinctively \u201cscientific\u201d\nexplanations that are the focus of his work. Scriven\u2019s cow\nexample, for example, does not show that the symmetry thesis does not\nhold for scientific explanations and scientific\npredictions, even if it shows that some ordinary predictions\nare not also ordinary explanations. But other\ncounter-examples posed greater threats.\n",
