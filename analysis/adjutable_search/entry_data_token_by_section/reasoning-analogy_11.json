Philosophical foundations for analogical reasoning\n\nWhat philosophical basis can be provided for reasoning by analogy?\nWhat justification can be given for the claim that analogical\narguments deliver plausible conclusions? There have been several ideas\nfor answering this question. One natural strategy assimilates\nanalogical reasoning to some other well-understood argument pattern, a\nform of deductive or inductive reasoning\n (\u00a74.1,\n \u00a74.2). A few philosophers have explored the possibility of\na priori justification\n (\u00a74.3).\n A pragmatic justification may be available for practical applications\nof analogy, notably in legal reasoning\n (\u00a74.4).\n\nAny attempt to provide a general justification for analogical\nreasoning faces a basic dilemma. The demands of generality require a\nhigh-level formulation of the problem and hence an abstract\ncharacterization of analogical arguments, such as schema (4). On the\nother hand, as noted previously, many analogical arguments that\nconform to schema (4) are bad arguments. So a general justification of\nanalogical reasoning cannot provide support for all arguments that\nconform to (4), on pain of proving too much. Instead, it must first\nspecify a subset of putatively \u2018good\u2019 analogical\narguments, and link the general justification to this specified\nsubset. The problem of justification is linked to the\nproblem of characterizing good analogical arguments. This\ndifficulty afflicts some of the strategies described in this\nsection.\n",
