Accordingly, philosophers concerned with\nthe nature of mathematics found themselves obliged to comment on the\ndiagrammatic proofs of the text. A central issue, if not the central\nissue, was the generality problem. The diagram that appears\nwith a Euclidean proof provides a single instantiation of the\ntype of geometric configurations the proof is about. Yet properties\nseen to hold in the diagram are taken to hold of all the\nconfigurations of the given type. What justifies this jump from the\nparticular to the general?\n\nAs an illustration, consider the proof for proposition 16 of book I of\nthe Elements. \n\nThe proposition is:\n\nIn any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle\nis greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.\n\n\nEuclid\u2019s proof is:\n\n\n\n Let ABC be a triangle, and let one side of it BC be produced to\nD;\n I say that the angle ACD is greater than the interior and\nopposite angle BAC.\n Let AC be bisected at E [I, 10], and let BE be joined and\nproduced in a straight line to F;\n let EF be made equal to BE [I,3], and let FC be joined.\n Then, since AE is equal to EC, and BE equal to EF, the two sides\nAE, EB are equal to the two sides CE, EF respectively; and the angle\nAEB is equal to the angle FEC [I, 15].\n Therefore the base AB is equal to the base FC, and the triangle\nABE is equal to the triangle CFE [I,4];therefore the angle BAE is\nequal to the angle ECF (which is also the angle ACF);\n But the angle ACD is greater than the angle ACF;\n Therefore the angle ACD is greater than BAE.\n\n\n\nThe proof seems to refer to the parts of the diagram given with the\nproof. Nevertheless the proof does not purport to establish something\njust about the triangle in the diagram, but something about all\ntriangles. The diagram thus serves to represent, in some way, all\ntriangles.\n\nThe role of diagrams as representations is remarked upon by Aristotle\nin book A, chapter 10 of the Posterior Analytics:\n\n\nThe geometer bases no conclusion on the particular line he has drawn\nbeing that which he has described, but [refers to] what is illustrated\nby the figures. (The translation is by T. Heath, found in Euclid 1956:\nvol. I, p.119)\n\n\nAristotle does not in passage confront the question of how the\ngeometer uses diagrams to reason about what they illustrate. A few\ncenturies later Proclus does in his commentary on the\nElements. Proclus asserts that passing from a particular\ninstance to a universal conclusion is justified because geometers\n\n\n\u2026 use the objects set out in the diagram not as these\nparticular figures, but as figures resembling others of the same sort.\nIt is not as having such-and-such a size that the angle before me is\nbisected, but as being rectilinear and nothing more\u2026Suppose the\ngiven angle is a right angle\u2026if I make no use of its rightness\nand consider only its rectilinear character, the proposition will\napply equally to all angles with rectilinear sides. (A Commentary\non the First Book of Euclid\u2019s Elements, Morrow\n 1970:\n 207))\n\n\nThe place of diagrams in geometry remained an issue into the early\nmodern period. Major philosophical figures in the 17th and\n18th centuries advanced positions on it. Anticipating the\npredominate modern view, Leibniz asserts:\n\n\n\u2026it is not the figures which furnish the proof with geometers,\nthough the style of the exposition may make you think so. The force of\nthe demonstration is independent of the figure drawn, which is drawn\nonly to facilitate the knowledge of our meaning, and to fix the\nattention; it is the universal propositions, i.e., the definitions,\naxioms, and theorems already demonstrated, which make the reasoning,\nand which would sustain it though the figure were not there. (1704\n New Essays:\n 403)\n\n\nIn the introduction to his Principles of Human Knowledge\n(1710, section 16), Berkeley reiterates 13 centuries later\nProclus\u2019s take on the generality problem. Though one always has\na particular triangle \u2018in view\u2019 when working through a\ndemonstration about triangles, there is \u2018not the least\nmention\u2019 of the particular details of the particular triangle in\nthe demonstration. The demonstration thus proves, according to\nBerkeley, a general proposition about triangles. \n\nThe most developed, and predictably most complex and difficult,\naccount of geometric diagrams in the modern period can be found in\nKant. Kant saw something of deep epistemological significance in the\ngeometer\u2019s use of a particular diagram to reason about a\ngeometric concept. In reasoning in this way, the geometer\n\n\nconsiders the concept in concreto, although non-empirically,\nbut rather solely as one it has exhibited a priori, i.e.,\nconstructed, and in which that which follows from the general\nconditions of the construction must also generally of the object of\nthe constructed concept. (1781, Critique of Pure Reason,\nA716/B744.)\n\n\nFor contrasting views of what passages like these reveal about where\ndiagrams fit in Kant\u2019s philosophy of geometry, see Shabel\n 2003\n and Friedman\n 2012.\n \n\nIn the 19th century geometry and mathematics as a whole\nunderwent a revolution. Concepts far more abstract and general than\nthose found in the Elements (e.g., non-Euclidean geometries,\nsets) emerged. Not only did questions about the nature of\nEuclid\u2019s diagrammatic method lose their urgency, the method came\nto be understood as mathematically flawed. The latter view found its\nmost precise expression in the groundbreaking work of Moritz Pasch,\nwho provided the first modern axiomatization of elementary geometry in\nPasch\n (1882).\n In it, Pasch showed how the subject could be developed without\nreference to diagrams or even to the geometric concepts diagrams\ninstantiate. The methodological norm guiding the work is nicely\nexpressed in the following often-quoted passage:\n\n\nIn fact, if geometry is genuinely deductive, the process of deducing\nmust be in all respects independent of the sense of the\ngeometrical concepts, just as it must be independent of figures; only\nthe relations set out between the geometrical concepts used\nin the propositions (respectively definitions) concerned ought to be\ntaken into account. (Pasch\n 1882:\n 98; emphasis in original. The translation here is from Schlimm\n 2010)\n\n\nThe norm has since entrenched itself both in mathematics and in\nphilosophical discussions of mathematics. It is its entrenchment in\nthe latter that Manders opposes in Manders\n 2008 [1995].\n In the account he develops of ancient geometry, the necessity of\nconsulting a diagram in a proof does not indicate a deductive gap.\nRather, diagram and text together form a rigorous and deductive\nmathematical proof.\n",
