    "main_text": "Mathematical Issues || A Generic Solution\n2.2 A Generic Solution\n\n\nTo answer this second question, it's useful to begin by comparing\nthe ordinary English interpretation of\n\u03a9(x)\u2014the one introduced three paragraphs\nago and the one which really does entail that x is\nuncountable\u2014with the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x) that's given by M and\n \u22a8.\n Clearly, it's this latter,\nmodel-theoretic interpretation which is most relevant to understanding\nthe fact that M\n \u22a8\n \u03a9[m\u02c6].\n Further, it's only if this\nmodel-theoretic interpretation is pretty closely tied to the ordinary\nEnglish interpretation\u2014and so, derivatively, to the ordinary\nEnglish expression \u201cx is uncountable\u201d\u2014that\nwe will have any real grounds for believing that the fact that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n should entail that\n m\u02c6 is uncountable.\n\n\nFortunately, even a rough description of the model-theoretic\ninterpretation is enough to show that no such \u201cclose ties\u201d\nexist. The model-theoretic interpretation is obtained by letting the\nsignificance of \u201c\u2208\u201d be fixed by the interpretation\nfunction of M, letting the quantifiers in\n\u03a9(x) range over the domain of\nM, and letting the significance of \u201c=\u201d and\nthe propositional connectives be fixed by the recursion clauses in the\nthe definition of first-order satisfaction. This description highlights\ntwo immediate differences between the model-theoretic interpretation\nand the ordinary English interpretation.\n\n\nFirst, the model-theoretic interpretation understands\n\u201c\u2208\u201d to refer to whatever binary relation on\nM happens to fall under the interpretation function of\nM; in contrast, the ordinary-English interpretation of\n\u03a9(x) understands \u201c\u2208\u201d to refer\nto the real set-theoretic membership relation. But there is no reason\nto think that these two understandings agree with each other. We can\nfind cases were M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2208 m2,\ndespite the fact that neither m1 nor\nm2 are even sets (indeed, as far as the model\ntheory is concerned, m1 and m2\ncould both be cats, or rabbits, or hedgehogs, or\n \u2026).[18]\n Further, even when\nall of the elements in M are sets, this\nprovides no guarantee that the model-theoretic understanding of\n\u201c\u2208\u201d will agree with the ordinary English\nunderstanding. We can find a case where m1 and\nm2 are genuine sets, but where M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1\n\u2208 m2, despite the fact that\nm1 is not really a member of\nm2; similarly, we can find a case where\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2209 m2,\ndespite the fact that m1 really is a\nmember of m2 (and where, once again,\nm1 and m2 are genuine\n sets).[19]\n\n\nSecond, the model-theoretic interpretation understands\n\u201c\u2203x\u201d and \u201c\u2200x\u201d to\nrange only over the domain of M, while the ordinary\nEnglish interpretation understands these quantifiers to range over the\nwhole set-theoretic universe. Clearly, these two understandings are\nquite different. Further, the differences in question are pretty\nclosely related to the sorts of sets that are involved in Skolem's\nParadox. Suppose, for instance, that M\n \u22a8\n \u201cm\u02c6\nis the set of\nreal numbers.\u201d Then a simple cardinality argument shows that\nthere are 2\u21350 real numbers which do not\nlive in the domain of M (and so, in particular, which\ndo not live in {m\u00a0 |\n\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}). \nHence, there's a real\ndifference between the genuinely uncountable set \u211c and\nthe merely countable set {m\u00a0 | \u00a0M\n\u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\u2014between,\n that is, the real set of real\nnumbers and the set of things which M merely thinks\nare real numbers. On the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x), the quantifiers only range over the\nlatter, smaller set, while on the ordinary English interpretation, they\nrange over the entire, larger set. Similarly, suppose that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u201cm is infinite.\u201d Then we can show\nthat there are exactly 2\u21350 bijections\nf\u2009:\u2009\u03c9 \u2192 {m\u2032 \u2208\nM \u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m\u2032 \u2208\n m\u2009}.[20]\n However, at most countably many of these\nbijections live in the domain of M. Hence, only\ncountably many of them are \u201cseen\u201d by \u2203x and\n\u2200x under the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x), although all\n2\u21350 of them are \u201cseen\u201d under\nthe ordinary English interpretation.\n\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that Skolem's Paradox may\nsimply turn on a surreptitious slide between two different\ninterpretations of \u03a9(x). Given a countable model\nfor ZFC, it's the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x) which allows us to find an element\n m\u02c6\n \u2208 M such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6].\nBut it's only the ordinary-English interpretation which provides us\nwith any real grounds for thinking that\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\nentails that\n m\u02c6 \nis uncountable. Further, and as we have\njust seen, there are enough differences between the model-theoretic\ninterpretation and the ordinary English interpretation to make us\nsuspicious of any facile slide between the two (even if we didn't know\nthat this slide would eventually lead us all the way to Skolem's\nParadox). In particular, then, we should resist any attempt to move\ndirectly from the fact that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n to the claim that\n m\u02c6 is uncountable.\n\n\nIn effect, this analysis treats Skolem's paradox as a\nstraightforward case of equivocation. There's one interpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n under which this formula really does entail that\n m\u02c6\n is an uncountable set; there's\nanother\u2014quite different\u2014interpretation which ensures that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6];\n Skolem's Paradox depends on\nconfusing these two interpretations. In principle, we should be no more\nsurprised to find that this confusion leads us astray then we are to\nfind that our direct deposits aren't buried in the local riverbank.\nIndeed the model-theoretic case may be a bit worse than the banking\ncase: you could get lucky and find buried treasure while digging in the\nriverbank, but it's a straightforward theorem that if\nM is countable, then\n{m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\n is also countable.\n\nThis, then, gives us a fairly simple solution to Skolem's Paradox. It's\na solution which explains why most mathematicians don't find the\nparadox very troubling, and it's also a fairly popular solution in the\nphilosophical literature. It is, for instance, essentially the solution\nthat Skolem himself gave back in 1922 (Skolem 1922), and variants of\nthis solution have appeared in more recent discussions of the paradox\n(Resnik 1966; Myhill 1967; Hart 1970; McIntosh 1979; Benacerraf 1985;\nShapiro 1991; Giaquinto 2002). It also appears in a number of recent\nintroductory textbooks (Shoenfield 1967; Kleene 1967; Fraenkel\net\u00a0al. 1984; Ebbinghaus et\u00a0al. 1994; van Dalen 1997). \n\n",
