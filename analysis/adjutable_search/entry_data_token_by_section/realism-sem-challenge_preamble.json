    "main_text": "\n\nAccording to metaphysical realism, the world is as it is independent\nof how humans or other inquiring agents take it to be. The objects the\nworld contains, together with their properties and the relations they\nenter into, fix the world\u2019s nature and these objects [together\nwith the properties they have and the relations they enter into] exist\nindependently of our ability to discover they do. Unless this is so,\nmetaphysical realists argue, none of our beliefs about our world could\nbe objectively true since true beliefs tell us how things are and\nbeliefs are objective when true or false independently of what anyone\nmight think.\n\nMany philosophers believe metaphysical realism is just plain common\nsense. Others believe it to be a direct implication of modern science,\nwhich paints humans as fallible creatures adrift in an inhospitable\nworld not of their making. Nonetheless, metaphysical realism is\ncontroversial. Besides the analytic question of what it means to\nassert that objects exist independently of the mind, metaphysical\nrealism also raises epistemological problems: how can we obtain\nknowledge of a mind-independent world? There are also prior semantic\nproblems, such as how links are set up between our beliefs and the\nmind-independent states of affairs they allegedly represent. This is\nthe Representation Problem.\n\nAnti-realists deny the world is mind-independent. Believing the\nepistemological and semantic problems to be insoluble, they conclude\nrealism must be false. The first anti-realist arguments based on\nexplicitly semantic considerations were advanced by Michael Dummett\nand Hilary Putnam. These are:\n\nDummett\u2019s Manifestation Argument: the cognitive and\nlinguistic behaviour of an agent provides no evidence that realist\nmind/world links exist;\nDummett\u2019s Language Acquisition Argument: if such links were\nto exist language learning would be impossible;\nPutnam\u2019s Brain-in-a-Vat Argument: realism entails both that\nwe could be massively deluded (\u2018brains in a vat\u2019) and that\nif we were we could not even form the belief that we were;\nPutnam\u2019s Conceptual Relativity Argument: it is senseless to\nask what the world contains independently of how we conceive of it,\nsince the objects that exist depend on the conceptual scheme used to\nclassify them;\nPutnam\u2019s Model-Theoretic Argument: realists must either hold\nthat an ideal theory passing every conceivable test could be false or\nthat perfectly determinate terms like \u2018cat\u2019 are massively\nindeterminate, and both alternatives are absurd.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll proceed by first defining metaphysical realism,\nillustrating its distinctive mind-independence claim with some\nexamples and distinguishing it from other doctrines with which it is\noften confused, in particular factualism. We\u2019ll then outline the\nRepresentation Problem in the course of presenting the anti-realist\nchallenges to metaphysical realism that are based on it. We discuss\nmetaphysical realist responses to these challenges, indicating how the\ndebates have proceeded, suggesting various alternatives and\ncountenancing anti-realist replies. We finish with a brief review of\nrecent realist/anti-realist debates in meta-ontology.\n",
