    "main_text": "Enlightenment and Revolution || Enlightenment Philosophy and the French Revolution\n2.1 Enlightenment Philosophy and the French Revolution\n\nThe Revolution was a time when philosophers came into the limelight,\nbooks inspired acts and reforms, and the words of Rousseau, Voltaire,\nAdam Smith, Thomas Paine and the Marquis de Condorcet were (at least\nfor some time) authoritative. But it\u2019s important to note that\nsome of the philosophers who influenced the ideals and the course of\nthe French Revolution were women. Sophie de Grouchy was one of\nthem.\n\nVoltaire and Rousseau were almost universally\ninfluential\u2014everyone who could read had heard of them, and while\nsome preferred one to the other, both figured in the collective\nimagination as a model for thinking social and political reforms.\nGrouchy had read both at convent school and Voltaire had been\nCondorcet\u2019s friend and mentor. Unfortunately, his acquaintance\nwith Voltaire began after the death of Voltaire\u2019s partner,\nphilosopher Emilie du Chatelet, which meant that there was no direct\nconnection between her and Grouchy.\n\nThe main external influences for late eighteenth century French\nRevolutionary philosophers were Adam Smith and Thomas Paine.\nSmith\u2019s Wealth of Nations had been a huge success in\nFrance and his economic thought was particularly influential for\nTurgot, France\u2019s finance minister before Necker, and Condorcet,\nofficer of the mint. Condorcet offered a copy of his Life of\nTurgot to Smith. While Smith and Turgot seem to have developed\ntheir theory of economics independently, there was certainly some\ncorrespondence between the two at a later stage.\n\nThomas Paine spent much of the period of the French Revolution in\nParis, and he was a good friend of the\nCondorcets\u2014Grouchy\u2019s command of English must have been\npart of the reason why he liked them, but also the couple and their\nfriends favored an American style of republicanism and Paine\u2019s\nknowledge and ideas were very useful in helping define what that\nmeant. Paine played a key role in the founding of the journal Le\nR\u00e9publicain, providing several pieces, which were almost\ncertainly translated by Grouchy.\n",
