Metaphysical Foundationalism\n\nMetaphysical foundationalism is the view that reality has a\nfoundation\u2014that there is a \u201cfundamental level\u201d, in a\nsense that needs to be specified. The most common way to specify the\nidea of having a foundation is in terms of well-foundedness, but as we\nhave seen in\n section 2,\n set-theoretical well-foundedness may be too strong to capture\nmetaphysical foundationalism. Metaphysical foundationalism comes in a\nvariety of strengths, depending on how much the well-foundedness\nrequirement is weakened. It seems reasonable to say that until quite\nrecently metaphysical foundationalism was the default position (R.\nCameron 2008; Schaffer 2009; 2010a; Bennett 2011a). The relevant\nintuition is often captured with the much-cited phrase that without a\nfoundation, \u201ca ground of being\u201d, \u201c[b]eing would be\ninfinitely deferred, never achieved\u201d (Schaffer 2009: 376; 2010a,\n62).\n\nSometimes the foundationalist intuition is explicitly tied to\ncomposition (i.e., mereological dependence) and the (im)possibility of\ngunk, namely, the idea that everything has a proper part:\n\u201cthe anti-gunk worry is that composition could never have got\noff the ground\u201d (R. Cameron 2008: 6). The worry is that complex\nobjects are not possible in gunky worlds, so given that there is\ncomposition, there must be a foundation. However, we\u2019ve seen\nthat fundamentality need not be tied to compositional/mereological\ndependence. Moreover, others (McKenzie 2011; Bliss 2013; Tahko 2014;\nMorganti 2014, 2018; Bohn 2018; Trogdon 2018b) have been suspicious of\nthe driving intuition behind this sense of metaphysical\nfoundationalism, and now even some of those who have earlier defended\nmetaphysical foundationalism opt for agnosticism on the question\n(Bennett 2017: 120ff; Rosen 2010: 116). Indeed, there is, perhaps, now\na consensus that it is very difficult to come up with a proper\nargument in favor of metaphysical foundationalism, something that\nwould go beyond the just stated intuition. The idea has a status\ncloser to a type of metaphysical axiom or law as\nBohn (2018) puts it (see Morganti 2018 for a good overview). This\nconclusion seems even more warranted given that defining metaphysical\nfoundationalism simply in terms of set-theoretical well-foundedness\nturned out to be too strict. To establish a clearer sense of\nmetaphysical foundationalism which is in accordance with the most\nrecent literature, we shall understand \u201cmetaphysical\nfoundationalism\u201d as it was defined in\n section 2\n(MF) (see Oberle 2022a for an overview of the most recent\ndebate).\n\nCan we be clearer on the core idea of metaphysical foundationalism? If\nwe can, then perhaps potential arguments for the view would also be\nmore easily available. One interesting attempt to do so is\n Raven\u2019s.[22]\n Raven\u2019s version of metaphysical foundationalism relies on the\nnotions of \u201celiminability\u201d and\n\u201cineliminability\u201d whereby an entity is eliminable if\nreality is described no worse without mentioning it and ineliminable\nif reality cannot be completely described without mentioning it. To\ndemonstrate this, let us take advantage of Raven\u2019s own\nterminology (2016: 614\u20135). Ineliminable entities\n\u201cpersist\u201d in some fact about them, whereas eliminables\n\u201cdisappear\u201d from all facts about them. For an entity to\n\u201cdisappear\u201d is for there to be a bound in the grounds of\nsome fact about it, a last occurrence of it after which the entity\nnever recurs. So, for an entity to persist is for some facts about it\nto be unbounded. Importantly, there are two ways to be unbounded:\nbeing ungrounded or having grounds but forever recurring. The first\ntype of persistence is the familiar sense of relative independence\n (RI)\n as defined in\n section 1.2.\n But the second type of persistence, where an entity forever recurs in\nthe chain of dependence, is\n novel.[23]\n\nA potentially helpful way to illustrate the options available to us\nand clarify the relationship between metaphysical foundationalism and\ninfinite descent is Morganti\u2019s (2015: 562) \u201cemergence\nmodel of being\u201d. This model may be contrasted with the\n\u201ctransmission model\u201d, which is, perhaps, what the\nmuch-quoted phrase from Schaffer that we led with reflects. According\nto the transmission model, the ungrounded entities are the\n\u201cground of being\u201d. But the emergence model suggests that\nsomething may act as a foundation in the absence of ungrounded\nentities; the infinite \u201cstarts playing an active role, and\nprogress is made as the chain lengthens\u201d (Morganti 2015: 562).\nThe emergence model draws inspiration from an analogy with\nepistemology where the \u201cemergence of justification\u201d from\nan infinite chain of reasons has recently been an area of active\nresearch (Klein 2007; Peijnenburg & Atkinson 2013). Thus, the core\nof the emergence model seems to be that there is no privileged\nfundamental level of reality that serves as the basis for being.\nInstead, we should understand being more holistically, as it were, and\nexplore the idea that it may emerge gradually. Let us call this\nemergentist infinitism. On the face of it, emergentist\ninfinitism looks like the denial of\n (MF)\n and hence metaphysical foundationalism. However, there is some room\nfor interpretation here, because the holistic model suggests that the\nwhole infinite chain could perhaps be considered to ground its\n\u201cparts\u201d.\n\nWe might compare this line of thinking to Leibniz\u2019s\nprinciple of sufficient reason (PSR), which states that for\nevery entity that exists, there is an explanation or reason for its\nexistence (Della Rocca 2010; Guigon 2015; Dasgupta 2016; Amijee 2020)\nand the separate entry on\n principle of sufficient reason).\n In the contemporary literature, we may compare (PSR) with the\ninheritance principle discussed in Schaffer (2016b) and Trogdon\n(2018b). An open question, although not one that we will pursue here,\nis whether emergentist infinitism is compatible with (PSR).\n\nWe should clarify one further issue regarding the analogy with\nepistemology. Both with epistemic infinitism and epistemic\ncoherentism, it is typical to consider foundational justification to\nbe impossible: all possible cases of epistemic justification\nmust conform to the infinitis/coherentist picture. It is not\nimmediately clear whether the corresponding metaphysical views\n(metaphysical infinitism and metaphysical\ncoherentism) would need to hold by necessity in a similar way. In\nfact, some of the arguments in the literature suggest that this may\nnot be the case, e.g., where the possibility of different\ntypes of infinite decent is considered (cf. Tahko 2014). If the\nstructure of reality is contingent in this regard then there may be a\nprincipled difference between the epistemic and the metaphysical\ncases. \n\nTo conclude this section, it should be noted that not all the views\ndiscussed above have been put forward under the label of metaphysical\nfoundationalism. But once it is made clear that the foundationalist\nidea is not tied to the strong, set-theoretic sense of\nwell-foundedness, the requirement for a foundation is much weaker than\nit may once have seemed. If we broaden the scope of metaphysical\nfoundationalism accordingly, is there still an interesting sense of\nmetaphysical infinitism to be discussed?\n",
