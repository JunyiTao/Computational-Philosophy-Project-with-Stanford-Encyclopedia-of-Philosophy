    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition || Evident Judgments\n4.4 Evident Judgments\n\nIf this is how we can understand an evident proposition, what then\nconstitutes an evident judgment? Again, a judgment, for Wodeham, is\nsharply distinguished from the distinct act of apprehension or the\nmental proposition. It amounts to a mental nod of approval to the\ncorrespondence between the apprehended proposition and the reality\nsignified. (See LS I, prol., d. 6, \u00a7\u00a020, I:176\u2013178.)\nClearly, the first two types of propositions do not provide us with\nabsolute certainty. These propositions have all the appearance of\ntruth, but the judgment that follows from them cannot be called\nevident as long as doubt remains, even if the judgment in question is\ncorrect.\n\nWhen it comes then to a truly evident judgment, propositions which are\nper se nota can cause evident judgments because the truth of\nthose propositions can in no way be doubted. However, besides\npropositions per se nota there are certain mechanisms through\nwhich originally dubitable propositions can come to be evident in the\nthird degree, thereby necessitating assent and causing a truly evident\njudgment.\n\nThe most obvious mechanism is the demonstrative syllogism, which leads\nus finally to Wodeham\u2019s conception of a science and the\nimmediate object of this act of assent. In article two of question\none, he discusses whether a scientific act of knowing (the evident\nassent given to the conclusion of a syllogism) has as its immediate\nobject \u201cthat which is signified by only one proposition, i.e.,\nthe conclusion\u201d or \u201cthat which is signified by the\nconclusion and the premises joined together at the same time through a\nsyllogism\u201d (LS I:199, ll. 5\u201311). Wodeham\u2019s\nconclusion is decidedly in favor of the latter; namely, in order for a\npreviously dubitable proposition to be elevated to the third degree of\nevidence, whereby the intellect is necessitated to assent, it must\nacquire that evidence from the force of the syllogism as whole. The\nconclusion by itself is not per se nota. Thus, for a truly\nevident judgment to take place, a single evident proposition cannot be\nits cause, rather all three propositions of the syllogism must be\ntaken together in order for the concluding proposition to have the\nevidence it needs to not only appear true, but to compel the\nmind\u2019s assent (LS I:199\u2013208). This requirement that\nscientific assent be given to the syllogism as a whole (and cannot be\nsustained if one of the premises is forgotten) is a position that will\nbe explicitly opposed by the later Parisian reader of Wodeham, Gregory\nof Rimini (Lectura, I, Prol., q. 3, a. 1, Trapp I:107ff).\n",
