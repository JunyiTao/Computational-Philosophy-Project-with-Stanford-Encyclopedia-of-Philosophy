    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || All Entities are Spatiotemporal\n6.2 All Entities are Spatiotemporal\n\n\nThe second reading of ontological naturalism, according to which all\nentities are spatiotemporal, amounts to a version of anti-platonism in\nthe philosophy of mathematics.\n\n\nThe position subdivides. On a reductionist view, mathematics is\ntaken at logico-grammatical face value but its objects (numbers,\nfunctions, sets, etc.) are taken to be spatiotemporal. This view is\nadvocated for sets in Armstrong (1991) and more generally in Bigelow\n(1988). Non-reductionist views are manifold. They include taking\nmathematics as meaningless symbol-manipulation (formalism), or as the\nexploration of what is true in all structures obeying the axioms\n(structuralism), or as the exploration of what is true in all possible\nstructures obeying the axioms (modal-structuralism). Bueno\n(forthcoming) discusses various nominalisms, i.e., views which\ncountenance only spatiotemporal entities. Since many of these\nnominalisms are compatible with non-naturalist as well as ontologically\nnaturalist motivations, we do not discuss them here. We concentrate on\na handful of issues relating mainly to reductionist versions of\nontological realism.\n\n\nReductionist ontological naturalism and non-modal structuralism about\nset theory face an immediate problem: there are apparently far fewer\nentities in spacetime than there are sets. Even on the most liberal\nassumptions (spacetime points and arbitrary regions thereof exist,\nsome smallish infinity of entities may be collocated at any of these\npoints or regions), the size of spacetime and the objects in it is a\nrelatively low infinite cardinality (surely no more than\n\u03c9\u2014even that is generous). Thus there are\nnot enough spatiotemporal entities to interpret set theory literally\nnor to make a structural interpretation of set theory non-vacuously\ntrue, and hence to ensure that set-theoretic falsehoods come out false\nrather than true. See Paseau (2008) for discussion of this and other\nproblems for set-theoretic reductionism.\n\n\nAnother problem is that even if spacetime were large enough to\nprovide either a model for a literal interpretation of set theory or an\ninstance for its structural interpretation, this would be a contingent\nfact about our universe. Set theory would be true but contingent. Since\nwe typically think of mathematics as necessary, however, this is an\nuntoward consequence for a philosophy of mathematics. Some might even\ncall it a reductio.\n\n\nVersions of these problems also affect Mill's empiricism\n(1843). For Mill, mathematics and logic are natural sciences, and their\nprinciples are laws of nature. Arithmetic, for instance, is the theory\nof aggregates, i.e., the theory of collections of concrete entities.\nGeometry is the theory of idealised limits of concrete\nentities\u2014lines, points, planes and so on\u2014whose principles\nare \u201creal facts with some of their circumstances exaggerated or\nomitted\u201d (Mill 1843, vol. 1, bk. II, ch.v). Millian philosophy of\nmathematics is susceptible to the cardinality problem just given. (Of\ncourse this is an anachronistic criticism, since infinitary set theory\nhad yet to be developed in Mill's time.) As for the\ncontingency of mathematics, Mill bit the bullet and accepted it.\n\n\nA related problem for a Millian view, which arises even for the\nmathematics of Mill's day, is a dilemma concerning the existence\nof aggregates of aggregates, aggregates of aggregates of\naggregates\u2026. Higher-order aggregates, if they exist, can only be\nabstract\u2014what else? But if they do not exist\u2014if there are\nonly first-order aggregates\u2014then in particular there are no\nnumbers of numbers, for instance it is meaningless or false to say that\nthere are two primes between 20 and 30.\n\n\nKitcher (1983) is an attempt to resuscitate Mill's philosophy\nof mathematics by modalising it. It accounts for mathematical truth in\nterms of the operations of a possible but non-actual ideal agent, and\nthus falls under the heading of modalist philosophies of mathematics.\n(Though Kitcher himself is not fond of the label (1983, \n121\u20132).)\n\n\nOther apparent problems for reductionist ontological naturalism\ninclude the problem of arbitrariness and the fact that it goes\nprofoundly against mathematical method. Suppose arithmetic is the study\nof some particular spatiotemporal entities. Very well; but which ones?\nSurely it is arbitrary which spatiotemporal entity is chosen as the\nnumber zero. This criticism is a version of a general anti-reductionist\nargument presented in Benacerraf (1965). The response to it is usually\nthat reductionism does not seek to uncover the meaning of number terms\nbut instead proposes a theoretical identification (Paseau 2009).  The charge of contradicting mathematical method is a serious one too. If mathematical objects are\nspatiotemporal, why do mathematicians not perform experiments to\ndiscover their properties? If mathematics were genuinely concerned with\nthe spatiotemporal, surely its methodology would be more\nempirical.\n\n\nOntological naturalist views of the type discussed are for these and\nrelated reasons seen as problematic, and are consequently\nunpopular.\n",
