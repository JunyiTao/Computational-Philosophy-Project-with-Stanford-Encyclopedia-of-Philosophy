Semiformal introduction\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the sentence (1), given above:\n\n(1)\n(1) is not true.\n\n\nIt will be useful to make the paradoxical reasoning explicit. First,\nsuppose that:\n\n(2)\n(1) is not true.\n\n\nIt seems an intuitive principle concerning truth that, for any\nsentence \\(p\\), we have the so-called T-biconditional\n\n(3)\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true iff \\(p\\).\n\n\n(Here we are using \u2018iff\u2019 as an abbreviation for \u2018if\nand only if\u2019.) In particular, we should have\n\n(4)\n\u2018(1) is not true\u2019 is true iff (1) is not true.\n\n\nThus, from (2) and (4), we get\n\n(5)\n\u2018(1) is not true\u2019 is true.\n\n\nThen we can apply the identity,\n\n(6)\n(1) = \u2018(1) is not true.\u2019\n\n\nto conclude that (1) is true. This all shows that if (1) is not true,\nthen (1) is true. Similarly, we can also argue that if (1) is true\nthen (1) is not true. So (1) seems to be both true and not true: hence\nthe paradox. As stated above, the three-valued approach to the paradox\ntakes the liar sentence, (1), to be neither true nor false. Exactly\nhow, or even whether, this move blocks the above reasoning is a matter\nfor debate.\n\nThe RTT is not designed to block reasoning of the above kind, but to\nmodel it \u2014 or most of\n it.[2]\n As stated above, the central idea is the idea of a revision\nprocess: a process by which we revise hypotheses about\nthe truth-value of one or more sentences.\n\nConsider the reasoning regarding the liar sentence, (1) above. Suppose\nthat we hypothesize that (1) is not true. Then, with an\napplication of the relevant T-biconditional, we might revise our\nhypothesis as follows:\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n(1) is not true. \n\nT-biconditional:\n\u2018(1) is not true\u2019 is true iff (1) is not true.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\u2018(1) is not true\u2019 is true. \n\nKnown identity:\n(1) = \u2018(1) is not true\u2019. \n\nConclusion:\n(1) is true. \n\nNew revised hypothesis:\n(1) is true.  \n\n\nWe could continue the revision process, by revising our hypothesis\nonce again, as follows:\n\n\n\nNew hypothesis:\n(1) is true. \n\nT-biconditional:\n\u2018(1) is not true\u2019 is true iff (1) is not true.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\u2018(1) is not true\u2019 is not true. \n\nKnown identity:\n(1) = \u2018(1) is not true\u2019. \n\nConclusion:\n(1) is not true. \n\nNew new revised hypothesis:\n(1) is not true.  \n\n\nAs the revision process continues, we flip back and forth between\ntaking the liar sentence to be true and not true.\n\nExample 1.1\n\nIt is worth seeing how this kind of revision reasoning works in a case\nwith several interconnected sentences. Let\u2019s apply the revision\nidea to the following three sentences:\n\n\n(7)\n(8) is true or (9) is true.\n(8)\n(7) is true.\n(9)\n(7) is not true.\n\n\nInformally, we might reason as follows. Either (7) is true or (7) is\nnot true. Thus, either (8) is true or (9) is true. Thus, (7) is true.\nThus (8) is true and (9) is not true, and (7) is still true. Iterating\nthe process once again, we get (8) is true, (9) is not true, and (7)\nis true. More formally, consider any initial hypothesis, \\(h_0\\),\nabout the truth values of (7), (8) and (9). Either \\(h_0\\) says that\n(7) is true or \\(h_0\\) says that (7) is not true. In either case, we\ncan use the T-biconditional to generate our revised hypothesis\n\\(h_1\\): if \\(h_0\\) says that (7) is true, then \\(h_1\\) says that\n\u2018(7) is true\u2019 is true, i.e. that (8) is true; and if\n\\(h_0\\) says that (7) is not true, then \\(h_1\\) says that \u2018(7)\nis not true\u2019 is true, i.e. that (9) is true. So \\(h_1\\) says\nthat either (8) is true or (9) is true. So \\(h_2\\) says that\n\u2018(8) is true or (9) is true\u2019 is true. In other words,\n\\(h_2\\) says that (7) is true. So no matter what hypothesis \\(h_0\\) we\nstart with, two iterations of the revision process lead to a\nhypothesis that (7) is true. Similarly, three or more\niterations of the revision process, lead to the hypothesis that (7) is\ntrue, (8) is true and (9) is not true \u2014 regardless of our\ninitial hypothesis. In Section 3, we will reconsider this example in a\nmore formal context.\n\n\nOne thing to note is that, in Example 1.1, the revision process yields\nstable truth values for all three sentences. The notion of a\nsentence stably true in all revision sequences will be a\ncentral notion for the RTT. The revision-theoretic treatment\ncontrasts, in this case, with the three-valued approach: on most ways\nof implementing the three-valued idea, all three sentences, (7), (8)\nand (9), turn out to be neither true nor\n false.[3]\n In this case, the RTT arguably better captures the correct informal\nreasoning than does the three-valued approach: the RTT assigns to the\nsentences (7), (8) and (9) the truth-values that were assigned to them\nby the informal reasoning given at the beginning of the example.\n",
