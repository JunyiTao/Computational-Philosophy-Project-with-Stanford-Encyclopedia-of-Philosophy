Ross\u2019s Life\n\nWilliam David Ross was born on 15 April 1877 in Thurso, Scotland. He\nspent the bulk of the first six years of his life in Travancore,\nIndia, where his father, John Ross, was the Principal of the\nMaharaja\u2019s College. He received his formal education in\nScotland, where he attended the Royal High School in Edinburgh and\nEdinburgh University. In 1895, Ross graduated from the latter with\nfirst-class honours in classics. He then entered Balliol College,\nOxford, where he obtained first-class honours in classical honour\nmoderations in 1898 and in literae humaniores in 1900. He was\nthen appointed lecturer at Oriel College, Oxford and at the same time\nhe was elected to a fellowship by examination at Merton College. In\n1902, he dropped the latter when he was elected tutor in philosophy\nand fellow at Oriel College, a position which he held until 1929.\n\nIn 1915, Ross joined the army. When World War I ended he was Deputy\nAssistant Secretary in the Ministry of Munitions, with the rank of\nMajor. He left the army with an OBE. Following the war, he remained\nfor some time in public service on a part-time basis; for his efforts\nhe was made a KBE in 1938. From 1923 to 1928 he was the Deputy\nWhite\u2019s Professor of Moral Philosophy while John Alexander\nStewart was ill. When the position became vacant in 1927, Ross refused\nto stand because (among other reasons) he thought his colleague H. A.\nPrichard a better moral philosopher (and better \u2018philosopher\ngenerally\u2019) and he preferred \u2018working on metaphysics,\nancient and the most modern\u2019 (Clark 1971, 534). Two years later,\nin 1929, he became Provost of Oriel College, a position he held until\nhe retired in 1947. In 1927, he was elected Fellow of the British\nAcademy, and he served as its president from 1936 to 1940. During this\ntime, he played a role in helping foreign scholars fleeing central\nEurope. In World War II he played an essential role in public service,\nserving on an Appeal Tribunal for Conscientious Objectors from 1940 to\n1941 and on the National Arbitration Tribunal from 1941 to 1952. He\nserved as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford from 1941 to 1944. Following the\nwar, in 1947, he became President of the Union Acad\u00e9mique\nInternationale, and, until 1949, the Chairman of the Royal Commission\non the Press. In his retirement Ross continued his work in philosophy.\nHe died in Oxford on 5 May 1971.\n\nRoss\u2019s contributions to university administration and to public\nservice were of no small importance. But it is for his work in\nphilosophy that he is best known. He made contributions to ancient\nphilosophy and to moral philosophy. In his lifetime, Ross was\nconsidered a major figure in the study of Aristotle (Wiggins 2004). He\nwas the General Editor of the Oxford Aristotle translation series,\nfirst with J. A. Smith and then alone; to this series he contributed\ntranslations of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and his\nNicomachean Ethics. Ross edited a number of Aristotle\u2019s\nworks in Greek for the Oxford Classical Texts series, including\nRhetoric, Physics, De Anima, and\nPolitics, and he produced editions of the\nMetaphysics, Physics, Parva Naturalia,\nAnalytics and De Anima with long introductions and\ndetailed commentaries. In addition, he produced two monographs,\nAristotle and Plato\u2019s Theory of Ideas. In\nmoral philosophy, Ross\u2019s most important contributions are\nexpressed in his books The Right and the Good and\nFoundations of Ethics. To these he added a handful of journal\narticles, a critical commentary on Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nGroundwork, Kant\u2019s Ethical Theory, and a\nchapter on Aristotle\u2019s ethics in Aristotle.\n\nIn the introduction to the sixth edition of Ross\u2019s\nAristotle, J. L. Ackrill remarks Ross \u2018made his mark in\npublic life and as a university teacher and administrator, and he\nwrote influential books on ethics. But it is as the leading\nAristotelian of the first half of the century that he will be most\nremembered\u2019 (AT ix). There is certainly no denying Ross was one\nof the most influential Aristotelians of the twentieth century.\nAlthough some of Ross\u2019s translations of Aristotle now have\nformidable competitors, they are still held in high regard. His\neditions of Aristotle\u2019s texts with commentaries continue to be\nan important source for scholars working in ancient philosophy. This\nshould not, however, lead to overlooking Ross\u2019s impact on moral\nphilosophy. Although Ross received rather short shrift from moral\nphilosophers in the last century (e.g., Raphael 1981; Rawls 1971;\nWarnock 1960 ), his ethical outlook is now considered a serious\ncontender and in recent years many of Ross\u2019s moral and\nmeta-ethical doctrines have received sustained attention and (in some\ncases) defence (see, e.g., Audi 1996, 2004; Dancy 2004; Gaut 2002;\nHurka 2004, 2014; McNaughton 1988, 1996; Parfit 2011; Phillips 2019;\nShaver 2007, 2014; Stratton-Lake 2002a, 2002b, 2011a, 2011b). It is\nreasonable, then, to say Ross will be remembered for his work in\nancient philosophy and his work in moral philosophy.\n2. The Data of Ethics\n\nRoss attempts to develop an ethical framework that is faithful to and\nreflects the central \u2018moral convictions of thoughtful and\nwell-educated people\u2019 (RG 41; FE 1\u20135). These convictions\nconstitute, for Ross, \u201cthe data of ethics just as\nsense-perceptions are the data of a natural science\u201d (RG 41). At\nleast some of these moral convictions, Ross thinks, constitute\nknowledge the philosopher neither proves nor disproves (RG\n20\u201321n1, 40). An ethical theory should not, Ross contends,\nrepudiate these convictions \u2013 these facts \u2013 in an effort\nto simplify or systematize our moral thinking (RG 19, 40; FE 5,\n83).\n\nOn the face of it, Ross is at odds with moral philosophers like Henry\nSidgwick who take the systematization and correction of common-sense\nmorality as one of the main roles of ethical theorizing (Sidgwick\n1907: 77). Sidgwick, for example, holds that \u201cthe philosopher\nseeks unity of principle, and consistency of method\u201d (even if\nthis leads to revision of common-sense thinking) (Sidgwick 1907, 6)\nand that the role of the moral philosopher is to \u2018enunciate, in\nfull breadth and clearness, those primary intuitions of Reason, by the\nscientific application of which the common moral thought of mankind\nmay be at once systematised and corrected\u2019 (Sidgwick 1907,\n373\u201374).\n\nRoss does, of course, acknowledge errors exist in our moral thinking.\nIndeed, it is, he says, \u2018a mistake to assume that all . . .\n[our] convictions are true, or even that they are all consistent;\nstill more, to assume they are all clear\u2019 (FE 1). Like some\nsense perceptions in science, he says, some of our moral convictions\nmay have to be discarded as illusory (RG 41). They are not discarded\nat the behest of a theory. Instead, they are to be rejected, Ross\nsays, \u2018only when they are in conflict with other convictions\nwhich stand better the test of reflection\u2019 (RG 41). The aim of\nmoral philosophy is to compare our moral convictions with each other,\n\u2018and to study them in themselves, with a view to seeing which\nbest survive such examination, and which must be rejected either\nbecause in themselves they are ill-grounded, or because they\ncontradict other convictions that are better grounded; and to clear\nup, so far as we can, ambiguities that lurk in them\u2019 (FE 1; also\nFE 2\u20133, 190). \n\nRoss suggests most errors in our moral thinking concern media\naxiomata \u2013 or middle principles or rules \u2013 rather\nthan fundamental moral principles (FE 190; RG 20\u201321n1). However, he\nseems at times to consider reflective inquiry with the potential for\nrevisions of a more radical nature. He suggests, for example, inquiry\ninto the \u2018historical origin of\u2026[our moral] beliefs and\npractices\u2019 may show \u2018the most strongly felt repulsions\ntowards certain types of conduct are relics of a bygone system of\ntotems and fetishes, their connexion with which is little suspected by\nthose who feel them\u2019 (RG 13). An inquiry of this kind may lead\nto significant revision of even aspects of moral thinking thought to\nbe fundamental (Singer 2005). \n\nMoreover, Ross at times suggests he aims to reflect the views of the\n\u2018thoughtful and well-educated\u2019 (RG 41) or, what comes to\nthe same thing, what \u2018we\u2019 think (RG 40; FE 102, 104, 134,\n172). But at other times he says he aims to reflect the views of the\n\u2018plain man\u2019 (RG 17, 20\u201321n1, 28, 57; FE 186, 187,\n188; KT 31). If the views of the thoughtful and well-educated and the\nplain man are distinct, and Ross inclines (with some justification)\ntoward the former rather than the latter, his approach to moral\ntheorising may be closer on the matter of reform (though not of\nsystem) to Sidgwick\u2019s (which, to be clear, emphasises what we\nthink on reflection and the consensus of experts (Sidgwick 1907,\n338\u2013343)). This may cause Ross trouble. He faults rival moral views\nfor conflicting with what \u2018plain men\u2019 think about ethics.\nIf he is open to substantially revising the plain person\u2019s\nviews, he may weaken his case against rivals.\n\nIn any case, the novelty of Ross\u2019s moral outlook and its fit\nwith what the plain person thinks will emerge only once its content is\nfully specified. About the data Ross seeks to clarify and honour, a\nnumber of questions emerge. What is its precise content? How is it\nknown? What is its metaphysical status? Together with his fidelity to\nreflective moral attitudes, Ross\u2019s answers to these questions\nconstitute his unique contribution to moral philosophy.\n3. Ross\u2019s Rejection of Kant\u2019s Deontology and Ideal Utilitarianism\n\nRoss rejects Kantian deontology and ideal utilitarianism (his main\nopponent). Ross complains that each of his rivals\n\u2018over-simplifies the moral life\u2019 (FE 189). They fail to\ncapture at least some of the moral attitudes constituting the\nknowledge the philosopher neither proves nor disproves (RG\n20\u201321n1).\n\nKant over-simplifies the moral life in a number of ways. Ross thinks\nthe clearest case of oversimplification is Kant\u2019s commitment to\nexceptionless moral principles (RG 18\u201319; FE 313, 134, 173; KT 24,\n95). Kant maintains lying is always wrong (Kant 1785, 1797). It\ncannot, he says, serve as a universal law that one may lie to avoid\nsome difficulty or harm (either to oneself or to another). As soon as\nlying in such cases is such a law it is impossible to benefit by\nlying, for everyone will be wise to the fact people lie in such cases.\nRoss disagrees. In line with common sense, he thinks it is permissible\nto lie in some contexts (RG 28), e.g., when the (net) benefit of lying\nsignificantly outweighs the cost as would be true of a case in which\none lies to prevent a friend from being killed by a would-be murderer\ninquiring about one\u2019s friend\u2019s whereabouts (KT 31\u201332; for\nKant\u2019s discussion of the case of the inquiring murderer, see\nKant 1797). Ross holds the oversimplification results in part from\nKant thinking \u2018the rightness or wrongness of an individual act\ncan be inferred with certainty from its falling or not falling under a\nrule capable of being universalised\u2019 (FE 189; also KT 25).\nKant\u2019s abstract way of ethical reasoning involves neglecting\nfactors relevant to figuring out what we should do (KT 33\u201334; FE\n189).\n\nKant oversimplifies the moral life in another way. He says only the\nmotive to do what is morally required because it is morally required\npossesses moral worth (Kant 1785). Ross contends other\nmotives have moral worth, including \u2018direct devotion to another\nperson or other persons\u2019 (KT 3). Returning favours to loved ones\nbecause you love them and not because you think you ought has moral\nvalue. It is closer to common sense to think moral life is not a\n\u2018contest between one element which alone has worth [i.e., the\nmotive to do what is right because it is right] and a multitude of\nothers which have none; the truth rather is that it is a struggle\nbetween a multiplicity of desires having various degrees of\nworth\u2019 (FE 206; also KT 3, 18, 93).\n\nThe ideal utilitarians Hastings Rashdall and G. E. Moore maintain an\nindividual acts rightly in so far as their act produces at least as\nmuch surplus general good as any other act they could have performed\nin their situation (Moore 1903, 1912; Rashdall 1907, 1913; for\ndetailed discussion of ideal utilitarianism, see Skelton 2011, 2013b).\nRoss holds ideal utilitarians guilty of distorting or oversimplifying\nmoral life in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, the view assumes, he says, there is a \u2018general character\nwhich makes right acts right\u2019, that of maximising a plurality of\nintrinsic goods (RG 16). By presupposing there is only one basic or\nunderived obligation ideal utilitarianism distorts our understanding\nof moral deliberation. For example, when deciding whether to fulfil a\npromise we think much more of the fact that in the past we have made a\npromise than of the consequences its fulfilment promotes (RG 17; Ross\n1931, 68). Our common-sense moral thinking includes the idea that what\nwe ought to do depends in part on retrospective considerations, e.g.,\nthat we have made a promise in the past or previously incurred a\ndebt.\n\nSecond, the view says the only morally salient relation \u2018in\nwhich my neighbours stand to me is that of being possible\nbeneficiaries by my action\u2019 (RG 19; OJ 125). But we stand in\nrelations of all kinds to other people, including that of creditor to\ndebtor, child to parent and friend to friend, and they matter in\nthemselves to what we are permitted or ought to do. You ought, for\ninstance, to pay your debts before donating to charities even if\ngiving priority to your debts fails to maximise surplus value.\n\nRoss\u2019s moral theory reinvigorated select doctrines defended by\nthe eighteenth-century moralists Joseph Butler and (it seems) Richard\nPrice. Ross revived the anti-utilitarian arguments in Butler\u2019s\nA Dissertation of the Nature of Virtue (Butler 1736, 139\u2013140)\nand in Price\u2019s A Review of the Principal Questions in\nMorals (especially Price 1787, 79ff., 131\u2013176). H. A. Prichard\n(Prichard 1912, 1932) and Moore (Moore 1903, 1912) were Ross\u2019s\nmost important contemporary influences. Ross found Prichard\u2019s\ndefense of a plurality of moral obligations and of the complexity of\nmoral decision making alluring. Ross rejected Moore\u2019s\nutilitarianism, but he sympathised with Moore\u2019s methodology for\nsoliciting intuitions about goodness and with some of his views about\nintrinsic value and moral semantics. Finally, Ross could not help\nbeing influenced by Aristotle. He was in particular impressed with\nAristotle\u2019s methodology and his appeal to the many and the\nwise.\n4. Ross\u2019s Distinctive Moral Framework: The Right and the Good\n\nIn a review of Foundations of Ethics, C. D. Broad writes\nThe Right and the Good was \u2018much the most important\ncontribution to ethical theory made in England for a generation\u2019\n(Broad 1940, 228). The best explanation of Broad\u2019s praise is the\nbook clarifies and defends a novel form of deontology, according to\nwhich there are a plurality of moral requirements and non-instrumental\ngoods. No one master principle explains why the particular things we\nbelieve are wrong/right are in fact wrong/right. Instead, there exist\na number of basic, defeasible moral principles resisting reduction to\nsome more fundamental principle. These principles are relied upon in\nmaking decisions about what we ought to do, though there is no sense\nin which we deduce what we ought to do from principles. No one\nnon-instrumental good/evil explains why the particular things we think\nare good/evil are in fact good/evil. Instead, there exist a number of\nnon-instrumental goods which cannot be reduced to some more\nfundamental non-instrumental good. These goods are appealed to in\nmaking decisions about the goodness or badness of a state of affairs\nall things considered, though there is no sense in which this is\ndeduced from these claims. Ross\u2019s clearheaded and forceful\nexpression of this view makes his work of lasting philosophical\nsignificance.\n4.1 The Right\n\nRoss subscribes to five underivative or foundational duties (Hurka\n2014; McNaughton 1996; Phillips 2019; Pickard-Cambridge 1932b;\nStratton-Lake 2002a, 2011a; cf. Jack 1971):\n\nA duty of fidelity, that is, a duty to keep our promises\n(RG 21; FE 76\u201377; KT 21);\nA duty of reparation, that is, a duty to correct a\nprevious wrong we have done (RG 21; FE 76; KT 21);\nA duty of gratitude, that is, a duty to return services\nto those from whom we have in the past accepted benefits (RG 21; FE\n76; KT 21);\nA duty of beneficence, that is, a duty to maximise\naggregate or general good (RG 25, 27, 30, 39; FE 67, 99, 130, 252,\n257, 271, 313; KT 21); and finally\nA duty of non-maleficence, that is, a duty not to harm or\ninjure others (RG 21\u201322, 26; FE 75, 130n1, 272).\n\n\nRoss\u2019s major innovation involves characterising these as\nprima facie duties rather than absolute or\nexceptionless duties. The notion of a prima facie\nduty may not be easy to grasp. Ross himself admits \u2018prima\nfacie\u2019 is an unfortunate phrase to use to specify what he\nhas in mind, for two reasons (RG 20; FE 84\u201385).\n\nFirst, although he says there exist five basic prima facie\nduties, what he is referring to are not really duties (RG 20;\nFE 84\u201385). Prima facie duties do not state our actual\nobligation or duty proper \u2013 the thing we ultimately ought do\n\u2013 in a particular situation (RG 20). Instead, each duty rests on\na separate and distinct ground and specifies a consideration counting\nin favour of or against an act or what to set ourselves to do, morally\nspeaking.[1] As\nDavid Phillips puts it, \u2018[t]he characteristic of being a prima\nfacie duty is the characteristic of having a certain degree of\nobligatoriness or weight in virtue of being of a single morally\nsignificant kind\u2019 (2019, 23). For example, that an act fails to\nfulfil a promise counts against it being right, and that an act\nproduces the most surplus good counts in favour of it being morally\nright. Considerations of this sort have to be weighed and balanced\nagainst each other in deciding what we ought to do all things\nconsidered or simpliciter.\n\nSecond, using the phrase suggests the duties only appear to be duties\nthat further reflection may reveal to be illusory. This is not\nRoss\u2019s view: the considerations his duties point to are\nobjective facts present in a situation (RG 20; FE 85). If you have\nwronged someone in the past, it is an objective fact of your situation\nthat there is a consideration in favour of you compensating them for\nthe harm.\n\nThere are numerous ways the idea of a prima facie duty might\nbe further clarified. One way, suggested by Ross, is to think of a\nprima facie duty as constituting a tendency to be\nmorally right or wrong (RG 28; FE 86). An act promoting general good\nhas, for example, a tendency to be morally right and to contribute to\ndetermining our actual obligation (Hurka 2014, 72). A second way, also\nsuggested by Ross, is to think of a prima facie duty as\ncomprising a responsibility (FE 85). Repairing one\u2019s past wrongs\nis something for which one has a responsibility, for instance, and\nthis contributes to determining one\u2019s actual obligation or\nresponsibility. A third (controversial) way of explicating the idea is\nto think of a prima facie duty as constituting a moral\nreason for or against an act (Cowan 2017, 825; Olsen 2014, 64\u201365,\n2015: 8; Shaver 2014, 314n24; Stratton-Lake 2002a, xxxiii\u2013xxxviii,\n2011a, 147\u201348, though cf. 2019). If my act will harm or injure another\nperson, I have a moral reason not to do it given the duty of\nnon-maleficence, and this reason contributes to determining my actual\nobligation. A fourth (more controversial still) way of clarifying the\nidea of a prima facie duty is to think of it as constituting\na reason (sans phrase) in favour of or against an act\n(Phillips 2019, 26\u201337; Shaver 2011, 144). Ross himself used the\nlanguage of reasons to explicate the idea of a prima facie\nduty. He says, for example, \u2018the fact that a promise has been\nmade itself constitutes a reason why it should be fulfilled\u2019 (KT\n21). These reasons contribute to determining my actual obligation or\nwhat I have actual reason to do.\n\nThe idea of a prima facie duty or obligation had not been\nfully clarified before Ross, either by defenders of deontological\ntheories (though see Price 1787, 152, 167, 168 and Prichard 2002,\n77\u201383) or their critics (including Moore 1903, 1912; Rashdall 1907,\n1913; and Sidgwick 1907). Ross\u2019s introduction of the notion of a\nprima facie obligation constitutes a major advance in the\ndispute between utilitarians and non-utilitarians. It paved the way\nfor a moderate deontology. Ross\u2019s innovation is crucial to\navoiding cases thought problematic for absolute deontology in which\nobligations conflict and one is unable to avoid doing what is all\nthings considered wrong (FE 83\u201386).\n\nRoss\u2019s five basic principles contribute to explaining other,\nnon-basic moral considerations. The duty not to lie has two sources.\nRoss thinks you ought not lie because, in line with the duty of\nnon-maleficence, to \u2018tell lies is prima facie to do a\npositive injury to another person\u2019 (RG 55) and because, in line\nwith the duty of fidelity, when you enter into a conversation there is\nan implicit promise or understanding \u2018language shall be used to\nconvey the real opinions of . . . speakers\u2019 (RG 54; also 21; FE\n97). The obligation to obey the laws of one\u2019s country is\nexplained by the obligations of gratitude, fidelity and beneficence\n(RG 27). If one has benefitted from the laws of one\u2019s country\none ought to obey those out of gratitude for the benefit; if one has\nremained in a country in which one knows one is expected to obey the\nlaws and one has relied on them for benefit, one has (at least\nimplicitly) promised to obey them and should do so for that reason; if\none\u2019s country\u2019s laws work to promote the general good, one\nought to obey them as part of promoting general good (RG 27\u201328).\n\nRoss does not think the five duties are of equal initial weight. The\nduty of non-maleficence is weightier than the duty to promote a\nmaximum of aggregate good (RG 21, 22; FE 75, 130n1). He writes:\n\u2018We think the principle \u2018do evil to no one\u2019 more\npressing than the principle \u2018do good to every one\u2019, except\nwhen the evil is very substantially outweighed by the good\u2019 (FE\n75). It takes substantial (net) benefit to justify intentionally\nharming someone. It would be wrong to harm someone to promote only a\nmarginal (net) benefit (contra utilitarianism).\n\nRoss suggests in addition the duties of fidelity, reparation, and\ngratitude are in general weightier than the duty to promote general\ngood (RG 19, 30, 41\u201342; FE 77, 76, 90, 187). It takes\nsubstantial (net) surplus value to justify begging off on one of these\nduties (RG 34\u201335). Unlike the duty to promote general good, the duties\nof fidelity, reparation and gratitude rest on personal relations with\nothers, generating special rather than general duties (FE 76, 186). It\nis important to Ross that we can stand in the obligation-generating\nrelations \u2018of promisee to promiser, of creditor to debtor, of\nwife to husband, of child to parent, of friend to friend, of fellow\ncountryman to fellow countryman, and the like\u2019 (RG 19; also 22;\nFE 76; OJ 124, 126). The duties core to these relationships are in\ngeneral weightier than the more general duty to promote the general\ngood. Rival views, as noted, ignore these morally significant\nrelations, or the \u2018highly personal character of duty\u2019, at\ntheir peril (RG 22). Finally, although he does not say it, his view\nwould surely be the duty of non-maleficence is weightier than the\nduties of reparation, gratitude, and fidelity: it is (unless much is\nat stake) wrong to harm others in order to fulfil these duties.\n\nRoss\u2019s introduction of a prima facie duty makes for\ncomplicated moral decision making. One way to further clarify the\nstructure of Ross\u2019s view is to examine what he says about what\nhe calls duty proper or our actual duty (RG 41). Suppose you\u2019ve\nagreed to meet a friend for coffee. On the way to meet your friend,\nyou witness an accident with several victims. You have taken first-aid\ncourses and are able to provide the accident victims with life-saving\ntreatment until the paramedics arrive. If you assist the accident\nvictims, you will not be able to meet your friend; if you meet your\nfriend, you will not be able to help the accident victims. So, you\neither break your promise or you benefit the accident victims. What is\nyour actual obligation in this (simple) case?\n\nRoss thinks right acts or our actual obligations have \u2018the\ngreatest balance of prima facie, rightness, in those respects\nin which they are prima facie right, over their prima\nfacie wrongness, in those respects in which they are prima\nfacie wrong\u2019 (RG 41; FE 85). In order to figure out which,\nof the acts open to you, has the greatest balance of prima\nfacie rightness over prima facie wrongness you have to\nlook at all the acts open to you and determine all the ways in which\nthey are prima facie right and all the ways in which they are\nprima facie wrong and then figure out in each case the\nbalance of prima facie rightness over prima facie\nwrongness or vice versa (whichever the case may be). You then compare\nthe acts open to you in terms of their balance of overall\nprima facie rightness. The act with the greatest balance of\noverall prima facie rightness is the one you ought all things\nconsidered to do and what you ought all things considered to do is\nyour duty proper (for detailed discussion, see Hurka 2014, 69\u201378;\nOlsen 2014; Phillips 2019, 17\u201326).\n\nIn the simple case you look at the two acts open to you: meet your\nfriend or aid the accident victims. Meeting your friend is prima\nfacie right because it comprises keeping your promise, but\nprima facie wrong because it involves failing to maximise\ngeneral good (in your circumstances). Helping the accident victims is\nwrong to the extent it involves breaking a promise, but right because\nit involves benefitting the victims. Ross says while there are no\ngeneral rules \u2018[f]or the estimation of the comparative\nstringency of . . . prima facie obligations\u2019 (RG 41),\nhis judgement is on reflection saving the accident victims is\nweightier than keeping your promise (RG 18), in which case, of the two\nacts, aiding the accident victims has on balance more prima\nfacie rightness. Helping the accident victims is, then, all\nthings considered, what you ought to do and therefore it is the right\nact \u2013 your actual duty \u2013 of those open to you.\n\nIt is not entirely clear what Ross thinks of the relationship between\nprima face duties and duty proper. In RG, Ross\nsuggests that the notion of our actual duty or duty proper is basic\nand that the notion of a prima facie duty could be defined in\nterms of it. So in the simple case discussed above Ross claimed that\nour actual duty was to help the accident victims and that prima\nfacie duties could be defined in terms of contributing to or\npotentially explaining why it is our duty proper. In this case, the\nidea of a prima facie duty and our actual duty are not in the\nend distinct (Hurka 2014, 75). \n\nHe seemed to change his mind about this in FE, where following Broad,\nhe took the idea of a prima facie duty to be basic and he\nunderstood it in terms of fittingness to some aspect of a situation\n(FE 79\u201382, 84; Broad 1930, 218\u2013220). In the simple case above, keeping\nyour promise to your friend is a prima facie duty as it is\nfitting to one aspect of the situation and benefitting the accident\nvictims is another prima facie duty as it is fitting to\nanother aspect of the situation. It is not entirely clear whether in\nFE Ross relied on to the concept of duty proper or instead whether he\nrelied on the idea of duty all things considered (Hurka 2014,\n74\u201375). In any case, Ross\u2019s view in FE is that we can\nunderstand prima face duty independently of the notion duty\nall things considered and we can define or understand the latter in\nterms of the former. \n\nRoss\u2019s pluralism faces attack from two opposing camps, from\nthose who think there are fewer than five basic responsibilities and\nfrom those who think there are more. Ross intimates his list is the\nbest representation of the core commitments of common-sense\nmorality (RG 20; FE 190). He is sanguine we have these\nresponsibilities. He says, for example, \u2018the existence of an\nobligation arising from the making of a promise is so axiomatic that\nno moral universe can be imagined in which it would not exist\u2019\n(FE 77; also KT 42). He is not entirely confident there exist only\nfive basic responsibilities. His list is offered \u2018without\nclaiming completeness or finality for it\u2019 (RG 20; also 23).\n\nRoss is not hostile to the idea we might recognise a \u2018new\nduty\u2019 in light of new circumstances (FE 189). However, he does\nsay \u2018the general principles which it [i.e., intuitionism]\nregards as intuitively seen to be true are very few in number and very\ngeneral in character\u2019 (FE 190). He seems to think most disputes\nabout his list would revolve around what should be added rather than\nwhat should be subtracted, since the responsibilities listed above are\n\u2018authentic\u2019 (RG 23), that is, responsibilities revealed\nupon sober reflection. But if new circumstances can lead to the\nrecognition of new duties, why may they not lead to the recognition\nthere are fewer basic duties than we might otherwise have supposed?\nThis seems to be the nub of the issue between Ross and his ideal\nutilitarian foes.\n\nIdeal utilitarians and others are keen to argue that Ross\u2019s view\nis problematic because it is not systematic enough. In Some\nProblems in Ethics, H. W. B. Joseph suggested views like\nRoss\u2019s go wrong, since \u2018our obligations are not a heap of\nunrelated obligations\u2019 (Joseph 1931 92; also 67\u201368). Forty\nyears later, Rawls registered the same complaint: without some account\nof how the plurality of normative principles are to be weighed against\none another using \u2018reasonable ethical criteria, the means of\nrational discussion have come to an end. An intuitionist conception of\njustice [and by extension ethics] is, one might say, but half a\nconception\u2019 (Rawls 1971, 41).\n\nRoss is moved in part by this sort of worry. He initially lists what\nappear to be seven responsibilities, including a responsibility of\njustice (a responsibility to bring about \u2018a distribution of\nhappiness between other people in proportion to merit\u2019 (RG 26,\n21)) and a responsibility of self-improvement (a responsibility to\nimprove oneself in respect of virtue and knowledge (RG 21)). He argues\nthese can be subsumed by the responsibility \u2018that we should\nproduce as much good as possible\u2019 (RG 27; also 30; FE\n288\u201389). His version of beneficence involves the promotion of as\nmuch as possible of the four goods of pleasure, virtue, knowledge and\njustice (RG 27, 154).\n\nBut Ross does not think that further contraction is warranted:\n\u2018[l]oyalty to the facts is worth more than a symmetrical\narchitectonic or a hastily reached simplicity\u2019 (RG 23; also FE\n83; OJ 125). Indeed, his case against his ideal utilitarian foes\nMoore, Rashdall, and Joseph is strong since they adopt a form of\nvalue pluralism for similar reasons. In the context of\ndefending his value pluralism, Moore says we cannot assume the\n\u2018truth on any subject-matter will display such symmetry as we\ndesire to see . . . [t]o search for \u2018unity\u2019 or\n\u2018system\u2019 at the expense of truth, is not, I take it, the\nproper business of philosophy\u2019 (Moore 1903, 222).\n\nRoss has a further argument against Rawls. Rawls\u2019s theory\ncontains two principles of justice, lexically ordered. His first\nprinciple outlining a set of basic rights takes priority over his\nsecond principle outlining the correct distribution of social benefits\nand burdens. Rawls does not think it is ever right to violate rights\nin order to produce just distributions. This gets him a theory as\nsystematic as his classical average utilitarian rival and more\nsystematic than Ross\u2019s theory. But Ross can argue Rawls achieves\nsystem at the expense of endorsing absolutism, which many acknowledge\nto have counterintuitive results. Might gaining a massive benefit for\nthe least well off not justify a trivial rights violation? \n\nRoss hopes to show his view comprises the best representation of\ncommon-sense morality or, as noted above, what \u2018we\u2019 think.\nWe might wonder whether this is the case. It is relatively clear most\nhedonistic utilitarians are reformers of common-sense morality (e.g.,\nBentham 1789; Mill 1863, 1843; Sidgwick 1907). These philosophers may\nnot be moved (at the level of moral foundations) by claims their view\nconflicts with common-sense morality. For their aim in part is to\nrevise it and make moral deliberation more systematic. Ross gives\nhedonism short shrift because he thinks it obvious pleasure is not the\nonly intrinsic value (RG 17, 99; FE 65). He often argues ideal\nutilitarianism, like hedonistic utilitarianism, can be dismissed\nbecause it is at odds with common-sense morality (RG 17\u201319, 38;\nFE 67ff.). Yet, it is far from clear ideal utilitarianism is reformist\nlike hedonistic or classical utilitarianism. The better way to\nrepresent the dispute between ideal utilitarians and Ross is over\nwhich view best represents common-sense moral thinking. It is\ncertainly true that the main proponents of ideal utilitarianism took\nthemselves to be aiming to provide the best representation of\ncommon-sense morality (e.g., Rashdall 1907; Pickard-Cambridge 1932b,\n152; Johnson 1953).\n\nAs Ross conducts it, the main dispute between the two revolves around\nthe issue of whether ideal utilitarians can make sense of the\nobligation to keep one\u2019s promises. Ross\u2019s view is\n\u2018[t]o make a promise is not merely to adapt an ingenious device\nfor promoting the general well-being; it is to put oneself in a new\nrelation to one person in particular, a relation which creates a\nspecifically new prima facie duty to him, not reducible to\nthe duty of promoting the general well-being of society\u2019 (RG\n38). (To clarify that Ross\u2019s target is ideal utilitarianism here\nwe have to substitute good for well-being as Ross does elsewhere (RG\n34\u201336). Ideal utilitarians can agree with Ross\u2019s point as\nstated. It might be true that promises are not a device for promoting\nwell-being but false they are not a device for promoting the good,\nwhich is the point ideal utilitarians wish to make.)\n\nRoss employs the following example to illustrate his initial case (RG\n34\u201335). Suppose by fulfilling a promise to Edward you produce\n100 units of (surplus) good for him, but by breaking the promise and\ndoing something else you have not promised to do you produce 101 units\nof (surplus) good for James. The ideal utilitarian view entails it is\nwrong to fulfil the promise: we must benefit James. But this is not\nthe verdict of common-sense morality. Ross says it takes a much\ngreater disparity in value between the two to justify breaking the\npromise (RG 35; FE 77, 90).\n\nIn reply, the ideal utilitarian may try to capture the common-sense\nverdict by noting breaking promises erodes mutual confidence and\nkeeping promises enhances mutual confidence (RG 38; FE 187). These\ngoods and evils tip the balance in favour of keeping the promise. Ross\nfrowns on this response. There will no doubt be cases, he says, where\nall the benefits of breaking the promise will outweigh (though only\nvery slightly) all the costs associated with breaking it, and in this\ncase the ideal utilitarian will have to admit it is obligatory to\nbreak the promise (RG 38). Ross thinks this is not the verdict of\ncommon-sense morality.\n\nClassical utilitarians might think in this case we should revise\ncommon-sense morality. If after all is said and done, it is better to\nbreak a promise, we should break it. They might insist that on sober\nreflection common sense is mistaken and promises just are devices for\npromoting well-being. Ideal utilitarians seem to opt for a different\nstrategy.\n\nIn an engaging set of essays, W. A. Pickard-Cambridge presses Ross on\nthe issue of whether ideal utilitarianism is actually as at odds with\ncommon-sense morality as Ross suggests (Pickard-Cambridge 1932a,\n1932b, 1932c). Pickard-Cambridge first argues there are strong direct\nand indirect reasons for taking promises very seriously\n(Pickard-Cambridge 1932b, 153\u2013157). He argues further ideal\nutilitarianism accounts better for our common-sense attitudes about\ncases of the following kind:\n\nChuck has promised Peter he will replace a string on his violin by\n4:00 pm tomorrow. Just before Chuck intends to fulfil the promise\nPeter contracts an illness making it impossible for him ever to use\nhis violin. It appears Chuck is not bound to fulfil the promise. This\nis the verdict of the plain man and the verdict of the ideal\nutilitarian, but it is not the verdict entailed by Ross\u2019s view\n(Pickard-Cambridge 1932b, 158).\nA rich miser pretends to be a pauper in order to get Richard to\nagree to pay him $100. Richard takes pity on him, and he agrees to pay\nhim the money in six months. Richard discovers a few months later\nthrough newspapers reports the miser is a fraud. Richard has no reason\nto fulfil the promise. Again, this is the verdict of the plain man and\nthe verdict of the ideal utilitarian, but it is not the verdict that\nseems entailed by Ross\u2019s view (Pickard-Cambridge 1932b,\n165\u2013166).\nA poor man contacts Anne via the Internet asking her to please pay\nhim $100.00 in six months. Anne agrees to give him the money. Three\nmonths later, before Anne has paid the money, the poor man wins the\nlottery and is rich. The ideal utilitarian says she is not bound to\nfulfil the promise and the plain man agrees, but this is not\nRoss\u2019s verdict (Pickard-Cambridge 1932b, 166).\n\n\nIn response to (1), Ross argues we must insist on \u2018some common\nsense in the interpretation of the promise\u2019 (FE 94; also 95,\n96). Both Peter and Chuck assume if by 3:00 Peter is rendered unable\never to use his violin, the promise is null and void. But the ideal\nutilitarian may say she can provide an interpretation of the promise\nand that her interpretation and its explanation fit more easily with\ncommon-sense morality. Peter and Chuck assume what they do because no\ngood would otherwise come from insisting on the promise being\nfulfilled.\n\nIn reply to (2), Ross says the promise \u2018arose out of\nconversation with the miser, which was conducted under the implied\ncontract to tell each other the truth\u2019 (FE 97). The miser lied.\nTherefore, the promise is null and void. The difficulty with this\nreply is for it to work Ross has to assume the implied contract\nstipulates we are to tell each other the whole or all the truth. But\nhe may not be entitled to this assumption. It is not obvious that when\nI sell you something I am required to tell you all the truths about\nthe item for sale. The ideal utilitarian is in a better position to\nexplain why in the case of the miser the implied contract to tell the\ntruth requires one not lie about being a beggar. The contract is\nspecified this way because it is beneficial for it to be so specified:\nit is not in general beneficial to honour fraudulent promises.\n\nIn reply to (3), Ross contends, initially, if Anne has \u2018a very\ndelicate sense of honour\u2019, she ought to consider paying the poor\nman on account of her carelessness in agreeing unconditionally in the\nfirst place (FE 97). This is not plausible. There is no reason to\nenrich an already rich person merely because of carelessness (of this\nsort). Ross further argues what is promised is not that Anne pay\n$100.00; rather, what is promised is she pay a poor man $100.00, and\nsince the man in question is no longer poor, there is therefore no\nneed to fulfil the promise (FE 97\u201398). But what drives this\ninterpretation of the promise? The ideal utilitarian may say the\nreason we interpret the promise this way is doing so is on balance\nbeneficial. Furthermore, the ideal utilitarian can argue that even\nwithout thinking of this interpretation of the promise we still\nbelieve we have no or only very weak reasons to pay, and that they can\noffer the best explanation of this fact. They can also explain why\nthis is (as Ross notes) a somewhat difficult issue to decide: there\nare utilitarian reasons on either side.\n\nPickard-Cambridge further argues ideal utilitarianism provides the\nbest explanation of the strength of a promise (1932b, 159\u2013163).\nRoss agrees some promises are more binding than others. A promise to\nvisit a sick friend is stronger than the promise to attend the theatre\nwith friends (FE 100). He suggests the former is stronger because of\nthe value of what is being promised (FE 100). An explicit promise is\nmore binding than a casual promise and more recent promise is more\nbinding than an older promise. Ross says this is because the manner in\nwhich and the time at which a promise has been made \u2018intensify\nthe promiser\u2019s awareness of its existence and the\npromisee\u2019s expectation of its fulfilment\u2019 (FE 101). These\nresponses seem to play right into the hands of the ideal utilitarian:\nthe promise is more binding when more value is at stake and when the\npromisee\u2019s expectations (and possible disappointment) are\ngreater, all of which are goods the ideal utilitarian claims we need\nto balance in deciding what we ought all things considered to do.\n\nRoss has one final reply to Pickard-Cambridge, using the following\nexample. A is dying. He entrusts his property to B,\non the strength of B\u2019s promise to give it to\nC. C does not know of A\u2019s intentions\nor B\u2019s promise. B\u2019s activities will not\ndisappoint A or C, nor will his activities\nnegatively impact the general mutual confidence. Suppose D\ncould make better use of the property than C. It follows on\nideal utilitarianism B ought to give the property to\nD. Ross thinks this breach of trust \u2018outrageous\u2019\n(FE 105).\n\nThe version of ideal utilitarianism to which Pickard-Cambridge\nsubscribes seems to entail B has no reason to fulfil the promise to A.\nThis is a problem for the view. However, Ross\u2019s own view may\nimply revision in this case, too. He says \u2018[w]hen we consider\nourselves bound\u2026to fulfil a promise, we think of the fulfilment\nof the promise as the bringing into existence of some source of\npleasure or satisfaction for the person to whom we have made the\npromise\u2019 (RG 162). This suggests the rightness of the promise\ndepends on it producing some pleasure or satisfaction for A.\nBut since A is dead when B fulfils the promise no\npleasure or satisfaction can be brought into existence for A,\nimplying that B has no obligation by Ross\u2019s lights to\nfulfil the promise.\n\nOf course, Ross might drop the requirement that the fulfilment of a\npromise must produce pleasure for the promisee and suggest instead\nonly the fulfilment of a promise be \u2018bonific\u2019 for someone\n(e.g., C) (RG 36; Ross 1928\u201329: 267\u201368). This seems to put him at odds\nwith the plain man in other cases, however. Consider a deathbed\npromise with a different content, that A be buried with\nC, his wife. Suppose this promise is not bonific. Ross will\nhave to say there is no reason to fulfil it (though perhaps he could\nclaim that fulfilling the promise is bonific since it satisfies\nA\u2019s desire (Skelton 2013a)). Hence, he may have to advocate\nrevision to common-sense morality. Perhaps he can argue his revision\nis more conservative than the revisions required by ideal\nutilitarianism. But this is a very thin difference; it may not be\nenough to give Ross the edge. Given these worries and the fact that\nideal utilitarianism seems quite close to the plain man or\ncommon-sense morality in many of the other important cases, its\nentailing it is right to break the promise in the initial case above\ncan hardly be considered a death blow.\n\nThe ideal utilitarian may not be satisfied with this outcome. Perhaps\nthe more appropriate route is not to opt for revision to common-sense\nmorality. For this may in the end give Ross a philosophical advantage,\nespecially if there is hope he can find satisfactory replies to\nPickard-Cambridge\u2019s objections. Instead, perhaps the better\nstrategy is to capture the importance of promise keeping to\ncommon-sense morality by holding that keeping promises is\nnon-instrumentally good or at least that breaking a promise is\nnon-instrumentally bad (Brennan 1989; Ewing 1957, 1959; Johnson 1953,\n1959; Shaver 2011). The general strategy is to subsume all of\nRoss\u2019s non-utilitarian duties in this way. This is a compelling\nresponse. To assess it, it is important to examine his theory of\nvalue.\n\nBefore discussing Ross\u2019s theory of value, it is important to\nnote two other reactions to his list of duties.\n\nRoss\u2019s foes are not alone in recommending fewer duties than he\nallows. Some of Ross\u2019s fans advocate for reducing his initial\nlist of duties, too. Phillips, for example, agrees Ross holds, at\nleast initially, there are five foundational duties (Phillips 2019,\n58\u201359). However, Phillips thinks the best account of Ross\u2019s view\ninvolves jettisoning the duty of non-maleficence (the\nresponsibility not to harm or injure others) (Phillips 2019,\n86\u201390).\n\nRoss pays little attention to the duty of non-maleficence. His main\nfocus is his four other duties \u2013 fidelity, reparation, gratitude, and\nbeneficence \u2013 which have a similar structure. Each involves promoting\nsome good or goods (RG 162; 1928\u20139: 267\u201368). Phillips thinks at the\ncore of Ross\u2019s view is the notion of an agent-relative\nintensifier. We have a general reason to promote various goods on\ngrounds of beneficence, and the duties of fidelity, reparation, and\ngratitude function to intensify reasons to provide certain\ngoods to certain people (Phillips 2019, 67ff). So, for example, if I\ncan benefit a benefactor or a total stranger to the same degree, I\nhave more reason \u2013 the reason is more intense \u2013 to benefit my\nbenefactor because I have a responsibility of gratitude to them. The\nduty of non-maleficence is not like this: it does not involve\npromoting a good (Hurka 2014, 182\u201383; Phillips 2019, 86\u201387).\n\nPhillips thinks there are good reasons to jettison the duty of\nnon-maleficence. Ross suggests the duty of non-maleficence in some way\nconstrains what we are permitted to do to promote general good. It is\nnot permissible, for example, to kill one person to prevent two other\npeople from being killed. Phillips thinks this leaves Ross susceptible\nto the paradox of deontology, which says it is paradoxical to hold\nsomeone\u2019s being harmed provides a consideration\nagainst, say, torturing, but not a consideration\nfavouring acting to prevent people from being harmed, say, by\nbeing tortured by someone else. The concern is: How can it be wrong to\nharm one person when by harming one person one can prevent two other\npeople from being harmed?\n\nPhillips does not abandon non-maleficence entirely. Instead, he\nattempts to capture our intuitions about the distinctive badness of\nharming or injuring by treating harming or injuring as a higher-level\nevil, involving an unfitting attitude (willing or wanting) toward a\nbase-level evil (harming or injuring) (Phillips 2019, 89). It is\nvicious to want to harm or injure someone, because harming or injuring\nanother person is bad. If we think of harming or injuring as a\nhigher-level evil we can, Phillips thinks, explain why harming is\nworse than failing to benefit, since \u2018[n]onbeneficence does not\nnecessarily involve any similar unfitting attitude\u2019 (Phillips\n2019, 89), though Phillip\u2019s suggestion will not capture the idea\nit is wrong to harm one person in order to prevent two from being\nharmed.\n\nPhillips\u2019s amendment may not recommend itself to Ross.\nJettisoning a requirement not to harm others involves giving up a\nsalient part of common-sense morality, involving the idea, as Ross\nputs it, of a duty based on people possessing \u2018definite rights,\nor at least claims, not to be made means to the giving of pleasure to\nothers; and claims that ought to be respected unless the net pleasure,\nor good, to be gained for the community by other action is very\nconsiderable\u2019 (FE 75). Phillip\u2019s suggestion may force us\nto reconsider whether interpreting the duties of promise keeping,\nreparation and gratitude as agent-relative intensifiers is right for\nRoss.\n\nIn addition, it is far from clear Phillips has established harming is\na distinctive evil as compared with nonbeneficence. Phillips says\nwhereas harming or injuring involves the unfitting attitude of wanting\nor aiming at a base bad (harm or injury), failure to benefit involves\nno bad attitude and so is not as bad as harming (Phillips 2019, 89).\nThis may not be obvious. When I fail to benefit I am\nindifferent to something good. This seems a wrong attitude to\nhave to a base good (benefits), making nonbeneficence no worse than\nharming. Of course, it is possible this indifference is not\nnecessarily involved in nonbeneficence, in which case it\nwould not be as bad harming or injuring. But it is far from clear that\nwhen I harm someone I necessarily will or desire injuring or\nharming them, in which case harming would not be worse than\nnonbeneficence. I might merely be aiming or willing benefits that my\nharming produces (for these criticisms, see Shaver 2020, 508).\n\nA different reaction to Ross\u2019s lists of duties is to argue it\nincludes too few responsibilities. Sidgwick famously claimed egoism\nand utilitarianism represent coordinate but conflicting requirements\nof rationality. On his view, we ought to maximise our own happiness\nand maximise general happiness (Sidgwick 1907, 496\u2013509). Sidgwick\nthought it could not be proved to the egoist that their happiness was\nnot for them all important and so the egoist could not be rationally\nconverted to utilitarianism (Sidgwick 1907, 420). (Sidgwick did think\nhe could convert adherents of something like Ross\u2019s view to\nutilitarianism (Sidgwick 1907, 337\u2013361.)) In defending egoism,\nSidgwick endorsed the existence of non-derivative agent-relative\nreasons. My good provides me with a special reason to promote my\nhappiness, a reason individuals other than me lack. These reasons\ncompete and (sometimes) conflict with the agent neutral reasons\nprovided by utilitarianism.\n\nChanneling Sidgwick, Phillips argues Ross should admit agent-relative\nreasons or intensifiers relating to one\u2019s own happiness.\nPhillips thinks \u2018[t]he fact that a pain will befall me rather\nthan someone else gives me a special extra reason to be concerned with\nthe pain \u2013 special extra reason that other people don\u2019t have.\nFacts about personal identity, that is, are agent-relative\nintensifiers of hedonic reasons\u2019 (Phillips 2019, 75). Many\nphilosophers agree (e.g., Butler 1736, 137, Price 1787, 148\u2013151,\nParfit 2011, 131).\n\nRoss does not think we have agent-relative moral reasons of this sort\nbecause he does not think there is a moral duty to promote\none\u2019s own happiness. He says \u2018the act of seeking pleasure\nfor oneself is not merely not obligatory, but has not even the\nspecific kind of rightness or fitness which is moral fitness. It seems\nmorally entirely colourless\u2019 (FE 277; also 272, 282, 288; RG\n151). We might agree it is it odd to say one has a moral duty to\npromote one\u2019s own happiness (though see Shaver 2014, 213\u201318 for\ndiscussion).\n\nThe difficulty is Ross seems to be of the view we have no reason\nwhatsoever to promote our own happiness (Parfit 2011, 372). He thinks\nthe only duties in existence are moral duties. This is hard to accept.\nIt does seem for many one\u2019s own happiness or one\u2019s own\nunhappiness provides one with reasons or obligations, though not\nnecessarily moral reasons or obligations. (Phillips can easily\naccommodate this thought since he holds the best way to understand\nprima facie duties is in terms of reasons rather than moral\nreasons or duties.)\n\nRoss seems also to think we have no reason to avoid our own pain. This\ncomes out clearly in his characterisations of the duty of\nnon-maleficence. It comprises a duty not to injure\n\u2018others\u2019 (RG 21); the duty rests on the fact that\n\u2018if there are things that are bad in themselves we ought,\nprima facie, not to bring them upon others\u2019 (RG 26). He\nseems, then, to think while I have a prima facie duty not to\nharm others, I have no such duty not to harm myself. It seems to\nfollow, then, it would not be morally wrong for me to impose a very\nlarge pain on myself to avoid only a trivial pain for another. It\nwould not be wrong, then, for me to make myself a mere \u2018means to\nthe giving of pleasure to others\u2019 (FE 75). This is hard to\naccept even if we accept Ross\u2019s view there exist only moral\nduties. It seems morally wrong to use oneself in this way. And even if\nwe are convinced we lack a moral duty to prevent our own pain we are\nvery unlikely to be convinced we lack strong non-moral reason to\nprevent it. Ross may have to modify his duty of non-maleficence to\naccommodate this.\n\nThese are not the only additions to Ross\u2019s list one might\nadvocate. Curiously missing from Ross\u2019s list is a prima\nfacie duty of veracity. We might agree with him (pace\nKant) when the (net) benefits of lying are considerable we have an\nobligation to lie, but disagree with his claim veracity is not a\nfoundational prima facie duty like fidelity and gratitude.\nRoss does not give an argument for why there is no foundational\nprima facie duty of veracity.\n\nRoss\u2019s thought seems to be the duty can be accounted for in\nterms of his five, foundational duties. As noted, Ross says the duty\nnot to lie rests in part on the duty of non-maleficence. It is wrong\nto lie because it involves inflicting a positive injury on another\nperson (RG 55). This might be true in part. But one might imagine\nsomeone replying with a claim similar to the one Ross makes in reply\nto utilitarian attempts to show the duty of fidelity to promises is\nnot foundational, namely, that, like promise keeping, veracity is not\njust a device for preventing bad outcomes. Even in cases where lying\nis beneficial it still might be prima facie wrong, for while\nit does not harm or injure anyone in Ross\u2019s sense, it does\nbypass another\u2019s will in an objectionable way.\n\nRoss also suggests lying is wrong because it involves breaking an\nimplicit promise \u2018not to tell ties which seems to be implied in\nthe act of entering into conversation\u2019 (RG 21; FE 97). Again,\nthis might capture some of what we think wrong with lying, but it may\nnot provide the full account of what makes it wrong. Ross says when\n\u2018we consider ourselves bound . . . to fulfil a promise, we think\nof the fulfilment of the promise as the bringing into existence of\nsome source of pleasure or satisfaction for the person to whom we have\nmade the promise\u2019 (RG 162). When we consider ourselves bound to\ntell the truth we are not clearly of the view doing so will promote\npleasure for the individual to whom we owe the obligation. Think here\nof being asked to provide an honest assessment of a student\u2019s\nwork. We think we ought to tell the truth, but this is not obviously\naccompanied by the thought doing so will bring into existence pleasure\nfor the student.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that we might think telling the truth is\naccompanied by the thought doing so will produce some other good\n(e.g., knowledge or insight) in which case Ross might be right the\nduty to tell the truth rests on the duty to fulfil a promise. But\nsomeone keen on a prima facie duty of veracity might insist\neven when no good is at stake it might still be prima facie\nright to tell the truth. It is hard to know what Ross can say to\nsomeone who insists on a self-standing prima facie duty of\nveracity (like Price 1787, 153).\n\nRoss mentions one good to be promoted under the duty of beneficence is\nthe good of justice which for him involves \u2018the bringing about\nof a distribution of happiness between other people in proportion to\nmerit\u2019 or virtue (RG 26; also 21, 27, 28, 138, 153\u2013154; FE 286).\nThis is but one element of justice, as Ross allows. He says many\nexisting injustices in his sense are due to \u2018social and economic\nsystems which we have \u2026 taken part in and assented to\u2019\n(RG 28) (including, we should imagine as Ross did not, the colonialism\nfrom which Ross\u2019s own college \u2013 Oriel College \u2013\nbenefitted (Clarke 1971, 327)). He says this fact reinforces our\nobligations of justice.\n\nRoss may be right. But our obligations to disrupt these systems is not\nmerely a matter of restoring justice in Ross\u2019s sense. It might\nbe the case that we have a prima facie obligation to\nfacilitate fair or equitable outcomes in the distribution of wealth\nand income that are unrelated to restoring or preventing injustice in\nRoss\u2019s case. Indeed, we might argue it is more important to\nachieve some fairness in the distribution of income and wealth and it\nwould be right to achieve it even at the expense of justice in\nRoss\u2019s sense.\n\nThere are other issues of justice Ross does not touch on. For example,\nRoss says very little about equality in the distribution of scare\nresources. Some think in distributing scarce medical resources (e.g.,\nICU beds) we ought to give priority to the least well off. Ross might\nthink considerations of this sort are captured by the duty of\nbeneficence. But many might think we should give priority to the least\nwell off even if this fails to promote the best outcomes. Ross may\nneed to include a prima facie duty of equity in his list to\naccommodate the full inventory of issues relating to justice.\n4.2 The Good\n\nIn RG, Ross argues four things are intrinsically good (RG 27, 102,\n134\u2013141):\n\nVirtue (or, \u2018virtuous disposition and action, i.e. action,\nor disposition to act, from any one of certain motives [desires], of\nwhich at all events the most notable are the desire to do one\u2019s\nduty, the desire to bring into being something that is good, and the\ndesire to give pleasure or save pain to others\u2019 (RG 134; also\n160);\nKnowledge (or apprehension of fact) and (to a lesser extent) right\nopinion (or correct belief about the ways things are);\nJustice (or happiness apportioned to merit or virtue); and\nPleasure[2].\n\n\nVirtue, knowledge and pleasure are states of mind, while justice is a\nrelation between states of mind (virtue and pleasure) (RG\n 140).[3]\n\nRoss does not think these values are of the same importance. He ranks\nthem. Virtue is ranked highest. It is \u2018superior\u2019 to all\nthe other goods (RG 153). It is, he says, \u2018infinitely\u2019\nbetter than knowledge (understood as a \u2018bare condition of the\nintellect\u2019 (RG 151)), pleasure, and (it seems) justice (RG 150,\n152\u2013154). As noted, there are three virtuous desires. These, too, are\nranked. The desire to do one\u2019s duty is more valuable than the\ndesire to promote what is good (e.g., virtue and knowledge) which is\nmore valuable than the desire to promote others\u2019 pleasure (RG\n164\u2013166). \n\nKnowledge is the next best, followed by right\n opinion.[4]\n Knowledge and right opinion are, for Ross, distinct states:\n\u2018Knowledge is apprehension of fact, and right opinion is not\nthat, but is simply a state of mind in which things are believed\n(not apprehended) to be related as they are in fact\nrelated\u2019 (RG 146). Knowledge is better than right opinion, for\ntwo reasons.\n\nFirst, knowledge involves direct apprehension of facts or the\ninferential apprehension of one fact \u2018as necessitated by other\nfacts\u2019, but right opinion is always partly grounded on\n\u2018the product of other psychical events such as wishes, hopes,\nfears, or the mere association of ideas\u2019 (RG 146). Second,\nknowledge involves certainty which right opinion lacks (RG 30,\n138\u2013139, 147). In addition, \u2018knowledge of general\nprinciples is intellectually more valuable than knowledge of isolated\nmatters of fact\u2019 and the more general the knowledge \u2013 the\nmore it explains or has the potential to explain other facts \u2013\nthe better it is (RG 147; for discussion, see Hurka 2014,\n206\u2013208).\n\nThe least valuable is pleasure (RG 152). It is unclear where exactly\nto place justice in Ross\u2019s hierarchy; he says only that it is\nless valuable than virtue (RG 153\u2013154). It is not implausible to\nthink it should be placed between (virtuous) knowledge and pleasure,\nand therefore the values are ranked as follows: virtue, (virtuous)\nknowledge, justice and pleasure.\n\nIn FE, Ross defends a slightly different view. He appears to maintain\nthere are four non-instrumental values (FE 19, 73, 180, 262, 278,\n288\u2013289):\n\nvirtue;\nintellectual and aesthetic activities;\njustice; and\n(others\u2019) pleasure.\n\n\nIn RG, Ross maintains all non-instrumental values are valuable in the\nsame way: their goodness is intrinsic to them (RG 115, 118, 132; also\nOJ 119; he returns to this position at KT 11\u201312;). In FE, he\nadopts a different stance. The value of virtue and intellectual\nactivities is a \u2018quality intrinsic to them\u2019 (FE 278).\nThese items are \u2018fit objects of admiration\u2019 or objects\n\u2018worthy of admiration\u2019 (FE 282\u2013283). By contrast,\nthe value of justice and pleasure is not intrinsic to them; rather,\ntheir value is based on a relation involving us rightly taking an\ninterest or rightly finding (some kind of) satisfaction in them (FE\n278). The pleasure of others and justice are \u2018worthy objects of\nsatisfaction\u2019 or things in which it is right to take\nsatisfaction or an interest (FE 275, 278, 282, 283, 288\u201389). The\ndifference in the source of value of the things in the two categories\nappears to follow from the fact \u2018while it is self-evident that\nthe only ground on which a thing is worthy of admiration is that it is\ngood in itself, it is not self-evident that the only ground on which a\nthing is worthy of our interest or liking is that it is good in\nitself\u2019 (FE\n 279).[5]\n\nThis distinction between types of non-instrumental value permits Ross\nto explain two things he thinks true of pleasure:\n\nOnly innocent pleasure is good, that is, pleasure not\nundeserved or taken in the misfortune of others or in lust or in\ncruelty (RG 136\u2013137, 151; FE 271\u2013272).\nOnly the innocent pleasure of others is good and hence\nwhy we think we have a duty to promote it and not our own (even\ninnocent) pleasure (FE 74\u201375, 272, 276, 279, 283,\n 322).[6]\n\n\nThe reason only innocent pleasure is valuable is only it is an object\nworthy of satisfaction. For Ross, it is not right to take satisfaction\nin, for instance, undeserved pleasure or pleasure in cruelty or lust.\nThe reason only the pleasure of others is valuable is, again, only in\nit is it right for one to take satisfaction. It is not right, thinks\nRoss, for one to take satisfaction in one\u2019s own pleasure.\n\nIn section 4.1 we discussed Ross\u2019s view we have no duty or\nobligation to promote our own pleasure or prevent our own pain. Here\nwe see one reason for this: one\u2019s own pain is not from\none\u2019s own point of view bad and one\u2019s own pleasure is not\nfrom one\u2019s own point of view good. These are not fit objects of\n(dis)satisfaction. Hence, we have no duty to prevent our own pain or\npromote our own\n pleasure.[7]\n\nIn RG, Ross wrestled with whether we have a duty to promote our own\npleasure, noting \u2018while we clearly recognize a duty to produce\npleasure for others, it is by no means so clear that we recognize a\nduty to produce pleasure for ourselves\u2019 (RG 24; also 25\u201326,\n151). Despite his lack of confidence, he affirmed in RG an obligation\nto promote our own happiness under the obligation of beneficence (RG\n25\u201326). However, as we have seen, there are traces of the view we have\nno duty to promote our own pleasure / prevent our own pain even in RG,\nincluding (as noted) in how he construes the duty of non-maleficence\n(e.g., at RG 21, 22, 28) and in his view it is not virtuous to desire\nto give yourself pleasure or save yourself pain (RG 134, 168; cf. Ross\n1928\u201329, 268\u201369).\n\nRoss is often unclear about the value and status of justice. He\nfrequently states there are only three intrinsic goods (FE 19, 180,\n262, 278; KT 11\u201312; OJ 119, 120, 121). In early writings, he\nclaims justice is a duty not a value (OJ 123). In RG, he is unclear,\nsometimes claiming justice is a good (RG 27) and sometimes that it is\na prima facie duty (RG 35). However, in FE he is relatively\nclear justice is good in the same sense the pleasure of others is\ngood, so it seems reasonable to conclude he thinks justice is a\nnon-instrumental good (FE 288\u2013289). He also suggests at one\npoint promise keeping is good in the same way justice and pleasure are\ngood (FE 289). But he more often rejects the claim that promise\nkeeping is good (FE 141, 142), suggesting not all objects worthy of\nsatisfaction are\n valuable.[8]\n\nThere are variety of ways in which to attack Ross\u2019s theory of\nvalue. As in the case of Ross\u2019s list of duties we can ask\nwhether his list should be expanded or contracted. But before we\ndiscuss this it is worth to examine a some of the unique and striking\nfeatures of Ross\u2019s value theory.\n\nRoss says a number of highly interesting things about knowledge,\nincluding about the value of knowledge (RG 148). One thing he says,\nfor example, is knowledge is always more valuable than right opinion.\nHe seems to think knowledge better in part because right opinion\nalways rests on \u2018psychological causes (largely\nirrational)\u2019, e.g., wishes, hopes, and fears (RG 146). Against\nRoss, one might suggest not all right opinion \u2013 e.g., opinion\ncarefully formed on the basis of the best evidence \u2013 necessarily\nrests on such causes (Phillips 2019, 144). Suppose having used the\nbest, most sophisticated polling data I believe with a credence level\nof 84% that a certain politician will win a by-election and she does.\nMy being able to have only probable opinion in this case need not\nresult from some intellectual vice or shortcoming.\n\nRoss might say in reply in the case of right opinion you cannot rule\nout that such causes are operating on your opinion, whereas in the\ncase of knowledge you can, because, on his conception of knowledge,\nwhen you know, you know you know. You have complete conviction (RG\n147). This might make knowledge more valuable. And, he might continue,\neven if you can rule out such causes in the case of right opinion\nright opinion is less valuable than knowledge because it is in some\nway always based on conjecture and merely contingent\nconnections between ideas and so held with some degree of\ndiffidence.\n\nRoss also says, as we noted, some virtuous motives are better than\nothers. We might question whether we really can affirm, for example,\nthe desire to do one\u2019s duty is always better than the desire to\nproduce something good (RG 164\u201365). The desire to do your duty because\nit is your duty seems no more valuable than the desire to promote good\nbecause it is good (Hurka 2003, 213\u201314). Both involve similar kinds of\nattitudes (loving the good and loving the right) and overcoming\nsimilar kinds of obstacles. It is not clear it is better to follow\nwarranted public health measures because you desire to do what you\nought rather than because you desire to promote general good.\n\nRoss\u2019s value theory also includes two very striking claims.\nPerhaps the most striking claim is about the value of virtue. He says\n\u2018no amount of pleasure is equal to any amount of\nvirtue\u2019 (RG 150; italics in original). This means a world with\nsome, very small amount of virtue but great amounts of (surplus) pain\nis better than a world with slightly less virtue (one more venial sin\nhas been committed) but great quantities of (surplus) pleasure. This\nis hard to believe. Surely, the second world is better (Price 1931,\n354; also Hurka 2014, 226; Phillips 2019, 120).\n\nRoss also says in FE that one\u2019s own (innocent) pleasure lacks\nnon-instrumental value from one\u2019s own point of view. He holds\nthis because, as we noted, only the (innocent) pleasure of others is\nsomething in which it is right to take satisfaction. Ross says little\nabout (innocent) pain. But his view seems to be my own (innocent) pain\nis not something in which it is right to take dissatisfaction.\n\nHowever, it does not seem like it is wrong to take dissatisfaction in\none\u2019s own pain. It seems right to take dissatisfaction in\none\u2019s wretched childhood (if one has had one) and to take\ndissatisfaction in the fact one\u2019s future is likely to be painful\n(after, say, a terminal cancer diagnosis). It is not clear, contra\nRoss, we could not follow these judgements with \u2018moral\nsafety\u2019 (FE 288). It might be harder to think it right to take\nsatisfaction in one\u2019s own pleasure. But, still, it does not seem\nwrong to take satisfaction in a joyous childhood (if one has had one)\nand to take satisfaction in the fact that one\u2019s future appears\nlikely to be enjoyable (see also Shaver 2014, 312).\n\nFurthermore, Broad rightly says we \u2018certainly condemn morally a\nperson who acts highly imprudently, i.e. one who unreasonably\ndiscounts his own probably future pleasures and unpleasures in\ncomparison with those which are immediately within his reach\u2019\n(Broad 1971, 274\u201375; also Butler 1736, 137\u2013138; Price 1787, 153). One\nplausible explanation of this is that one\u2019s own pleasure (pain)\nis non-instrumentally good (bad).\n\nRoss\u2019s worry seems to be that it is odd to say it would be\nmorally right to take satisfaction in one\u2019s own\npleasure and morally right to take dissatisfaction in\none\u2019s own pain (FE 322; also 324, 282, 288; RG 151). Perhaps the\nright reply, then, is to say that there is reason to take\nsatisfaction in one\u2019s own pleasure and reason to take\ndissatisfaction in one\u2019s own pain.\n\nIn general, Ross\u2019s value theory is too rigid. One of the\nattractive features of his theory of prima facie duties is\nits flexibility and its lack of a rigid hierarchy amongst the duties.\nIt is always possible for any one duty to outweigh any other. Ross\nwould do well to inject some of this flexibility into his value\ntheory, thinking it is always possible for one value to outweigh any\nother in some context. This seems a better fit with what\n\u2018we\u2019 think on reflection.\n\nIn the last section we explored some attempts by ideal utilitarians to\nshow there are fewer duties than Ross allows. Some ideal utilitarians\ntake the opposite position with respect to his list of values. They\nthink it should be expanded or (at any rate) modified. They think a\nplausible list would incorporate the values of keeping promises,\nexpressing gratitude and compensating for past wrongs. The idea is\nthat acts of this sort have value. They think this will help capture\nour intuitions about the ethical importance of promise keeping,\ngratitude and reparation while retaining the idea it is never right to\ndo less than the (impartial) best. Grappling with this puts us in a\nposition us to assess the second ideal utilitarian reply to\nRoss\u2019s objections mentioned in the last section.\n\nRecall again one of Ross\u2019s examples to suggest ideal\nutilitarianism cannot make sense of the obligation to keep one\u2019s\npromises:\n\n\nA is dying. He entrusts his property to B, on the\nstrength of B\u2019s promise to give it to C.\nC does not know of A\u2019s intentions or\nB\u2019s promise. B\u2019s activities will not\ndisappoint A or C, nor will his activities\nnegatively impact the general mutual confidence. Suppose D\ncould make better use of the property than C. It follows on\nideal utilitarianism B ought to give the property to\nD.\n\n\nRoss thinks this breach of trust \u2018outrageous\u2019 (FE\n105).\n\nIn reply, some ideal utilitarians contend they can agree in this case\nthe promise ought to be kept by adding a value to Ross\u2019s list\nand say (the act of) promise keeping is non-instrumentally valuable\n(or at least that promise breaking is evil). The most plausible form\nof this argument states Ross must accept promise keeping is valuable\nbecause he accepts knowledge and justice are valuable and there is no\nreal difference between these values and the value of keeping promises\nor the disvalue of breaking promises (Shaver 2011, 130ff.).\n\nThe characterisation of Ross\u2019s value theory in this section\nprovides him with a potential defence. He seems to insist on many\noccasions only states of mind or relations between states of mind have\nnon-instrumental value. Promise keeping, reparation, and gratitude are\nnot merely states of mind or relations between states of mind.\nTherefore, they are not non-instrumentally good.\n\nOne worry with this reply is knowledge is not merely a state of mind.\nIt involves relations to what grounds it. In RG, Ross insists\nknowledge has intrinsic value. He sometimes suggests this in FE.\nHowever, his considered seems to be that it is not knowledge but\nintellectual and aesthetic activities that have value (FE 19, 27, 73,\n180, 262, 266, 267, 270, 278, 282\u2013283, 284, 290, 296; also OJ\n119, 120, 121; KT 11\u201312). And these, we might think, are states of\nmind.\n\nThis reply might cause Ross problems. If he says knowledge is not\nintrinsically valuable but intellectual activities are, he cannot say\nan activity of the mind is better when it issues in knowledge (FE 270;\nShaver 2011, 134n34). Perhaps Ross will have to say intellectual\nactivities leading to knowledge are better, not because knowledge is\nitself good, but because of its instrumental properties, e.g.,\nknowledge might lead us to being most effective at promoting justice\nor virtue or pleasure. A fortiori the claim it is\nintellectual activities that are intrinsically good explains why some\ninstances of knowledge are more important than others. Ross says\n\u2018different instances of this [intellectual] activity are good in\nproportion as they are conducted according to these principles\u2019\n(FE 270; also RG 151\u2013152), i.e., principles discovered by logic.\nBecause, say, more philosophical or more general knowledge requires\ngreater and more sophisticated use of \u2018the principles discovered\nby logic\u2019 (FE 270), it is better than knowledge of the sex lives\nof movie stars. The value of the intellectual activities explains the\nvalue of the knowledge.\n\nBut what about the fact that justice is an intrinsic value? It is not\na state of consciousness; it is a relation between states of\nconsciousness (RG 140). If Ross is willing to accept justice as a\ngood, why not accept (the act of) promise keeping, and so on, are\ngood? Ross might insist justice is different from promise keeping,\nreparation, and gratitude because it is compounded from states of\nconsciousness and that is why it and not these other things are good.\nHowever, perhaps the better reply is to stop treating justice as a\nvalue. He repeatedly contends it is only states of mind that have\nvalue (OJ 118; RG 122, 106\u2013107, 140; FE 259, 270; KT 21), and\njustice is not a state of mind. He can insist only states of mind have\nvalue and block the ideal utilitarian response. Ross is open to\ncharacterising justice as a requirement of duty rather than a value\n(FE 319), and he losses little by not listing it as a value. Further,\nit might be more acceptable and capture more of what we think about\njustice to construe justice (in his sense and others) as a\n duty.[9] \nMany think justice constrains what we are permitted to do to\npromote general good and Ross sometimes agrees (FE 71).\n\nIt is, of course, open to a critic to argue there is little reason to\nthink that only states of mind have value. Ross does little to defend\nthe view. Indeed, he might be forced to reconsider whether only states\nof consciousness possess value once he is confronted with the idea\nthat achievement is among the things we seem to value, where this\ninvolves \u2018having a goal for how the world should be and then\nrealizing it\u2019 (Hurka 2014, 209). Achievement involves\ninteracting with and affecting the world, including doing things like\nwriting a book, raising a child to adulthood and building a muscular\nphysique.\n\nRoss relies quite heavily on the Moorean isolation method to defend\nhis value theory (Moore 1903, 93, 95\u201396, 187\u201388). You figure out\nwhether something is non-instrumentally valuable by considering it by\nitself or in isolation (KT 10, 11). His value theory came under much\nless scrutiny than did his theory of right, and therefore he did not\nsee fit to consider monistic responses to it. This may in part be\nbecause there is agreement amongst his main rivals\u2014Moore,\nRashdall, Pickard-Cambridge, Ewing, and Johnson\u2014that value\npluralism is true. This may also be because he considered the main\nmonistic rival\u2014that is, hedonism\u2014a dead end (RG 98; FE\n65). But hedonism lives on (Bradley 2009; Crisp 2006; de Lazari-Radek\nand Singer 2014; Feldman 2004; Hewitt 2010; Mendola 2006). Therefore,\nRoss\u2019s value theory may be in for a challenge neither he nor his\nideal utilitarian critics anticipated.\n\nTo get a taste of what this challenge may look like consider the\nfollowing hedonistic reply to Ross\u2019s argument for the idea\nvirtue is intrinsically valuable. Hedonists hold pace Ross\nthat while it is obvious virtue is instrumentally good and vice is\ninstrumentally bad, it is far from clear the former is intrinsically\ngood and the latter is intrinsically bad (Sidgwick 1907: 400ff.). In\nresponse, Ross asks us to imagine two worlds, W1\nand W2. W1 and\nW2 include the same quantity of pleasure. However,\nW1 contains agents that are virtuous, who act from\nor who are disposed to act from the right motives, while\nW2 contains agents who are vicious, who act from\nor who are disposed to act from the wrong motives. Is not\nW1 preferable to W2? Ross\nthinks it is, and he says what explains this is virtue is\nintrinsically good (RG 134).\n\nBut the hedonist has a reply. The situation envisaged is implausible,\nfor surely W1 would have more pleasure than\nW2 because typically virtuous people produce more\npleasure than vicious people. Indeed, would not a world with virtuous\npeople be more likely to continue to be filled with pleasure and lack\nthe possibility of descending into chaos than a world with vicious\npeople? Is not this ultimately the reason why we desire or prefer\nit?\n\nIn response, Ross reminds us not all pleasure springs from the actions\nof virtuous people and not all pain springs from actions of vicious\n(RG 134). Some results from \u2018the operation of natural\nlaws\u2019 (RG 134). Suppose, then, there are two worlds,\nW1 and W2.\nW1 contains virtuous people and\nW2 contains vicious people, and the two worlds\ncontain equal amounts of pleasure, because although\nW1-type worlds usually contain more pleasure than\nW2-type worlds, W1\u2019s\nextra virtue-generated pleasure is offset by \u2018a much greater\nincidence of disease\u2019, making the worlds equal in pleasure. Ross\ncontends it is still the case the virtuous world,\nW1, is better than W2.\n\nThis is a good response. The hedonist may have a rejoinder. Would not\nW1 be on the whole better (hedonistically\nspeaking) in the long run because of the virtuous people? Would not\nW1 be a place where it is more likely to be the\ncase a cure is found or where it is more likely pain is treated\neffectively and sympathetically or where it is more likely to remain\nstable enough to handle the disease and illness? Ross may rely on\nstrategies similar to the ones he adopts against the ideal\nutilitarian\u2019s attempt to show she can explain the importance of\npromise keeping (RG 38). But it is clear proponents of Ross\u2019s\nview of value may well have to contend with arguments of this variety\ngiven the recent resurgence of hedonism. They may have to contend more\nspecifically with hedonistic replies questioning the reliability of\nthe intuitions to which Ross appeal in his attempt to argue for value\npluralism.\n5. Ross\u2019s Moral Epistemology\n\nHow do we acquire moral and axiological knowledge? Ross holds\n\u2018both in mathematics and in ethics we have certain crystal-clear\nintuitions from which we build up all that we can know about the\nnature of numbers and the nature of duty\u2019 (FE 144). Our\nknowledge of the basic moral and axiological propositions which are\nthe object of moral intuitions is non-inferential (OJ 121, 123; RG 29,\n146; FE 144, 172, 262, 320). They are non-inferentially knowable\nbecause they are self-evident or knowable on the basis of an\nunderstanding of the self-evident proposition alone (RG 20n1, 29; FE\n320). For example, that we have a responsibility to keep our promises\nis self-evident (RG 29). It is by a process of reflection on this\nproposition that we come to apprehend we have this responsibility.\nRoss thinks we can trust our moral apprehensions, and since\napprehension is a matter of knowledge, and knowledge implies\ncertainty, he is certain we have the above responsibilities and that\ncertain things are intrinsically valuable (RG 146, 29, 30; KT 42;\nSkelton 2007; cf. Audi 2004).\n\nThat our responsibilities are self-evident does not entail they are\nobvious to everyone who reflects on them. Ross says a responsibility\nis self-evident \u2018not in the sense that it is evident from the\nbeginning of our lives, or as soon as we attend to the proposition for\nthe first time, but in the sense that when we have reached sufficient\nmental maturity and have given sufficient attention to the proposition\nit is evident without any need of proof, or of evidence beyond itself.\nIt is self-evident just as a mathematical axiom, or the validity of a\nform of inference, is evident\u2019 (RG 29; also 12, 32; KT 42).\n\nThe analogy with mathematics is instructive, for we acquire our moral\nknowledge in the same way we acquire knowledge of mathematical axioms.\nWe apprehend that 2+2 = 4 by apprehending 2+2 matches makes 4 matches\nand 2+2 balls makes 4 balls, and so on. We apprehend the algorithm in\nthe particular cases after exposure to particular instances of its\napplication, by a process of intuitive induction (FE 170). We\napprehend it is prima facie right to keep promises by\napprehending it is prima facie right to fulfill this or that\nparticular promise. \u2018What comes first in time is the\napprehension of the self-evident prima facie rightness of an\nindividual act of a particular type. From this we come by reflection\nto apprehend the self-evident general principle of prima\nfacie duty\u2019 (RG 33; also FE 170).\n\nHow do we decide or form epistemic attitudes about our actual\nobligation in a particular circumstance? What one ought to do in a\nparticular case, as we noted above, is that act \u2018of all those\npossible for the agent in the circumstances, [that has]\u2026the\ngreatest balance of prima facie rightness, in those respects\nin which they are prima facie right, over their prima\nfacie wrongness, in those respects in which they are prima\nfacie wrong\u2019 (RG 41; also RG 46). To figure out which, of\nthe acts open to you, has the greatest balance of prima facie\nrightness over prima facie wrongness you look at all the acts\nopen to you and determine all the ways in which they are prima\nfacie right and all the ways in which they are prima\nfacie wrong and then figure out in each case the balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness.\nYou then compare the acts open to you in terms of their balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness.\nThe act with the greatest balance of overall prima facie\nrightness is the one you ought all things considered to do and what\nyou ought all things considered to do is what you ought or it is right\nto do.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the prima facie\nresponsibilities we have and the \u2018actual or absolute duty to do\none particular act in particular circumstances\u2019 (RG 28)?  Our\nself-evident prima facie responsibilities are not\n\u2018principles by the immediate application of which our duty in\nparticular circumstances can be deduced\u2019 (FE 84; also 169, 171;\nOJ 122, 127). Instead, one determines one\u2019s actual duty or\none\u2019s duty proper, by reference to \u2018all the\nmorally significant kinds it [the act] is an instance of\u2019 (RG\n20; italics in original; also FE 84, 186; OJ 126\u2013127).\nOne\u2019s actual responsibility or duty \u2018belongs to an act in\nvirtue of its whole nature and of nothing less than this\u2019 (RG\n28; also 33, 132).\n\nRoss is not exactly right here, for one has to engage in a fair amount\nof comparison of rival acts open to one in terms of their balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness.\nThe idea is our prima facie principles provide moral\nconsiderations or factors of direct relevance to the morality of each\nof the acts open to us. We have to judge with respect to each act open\nto us to what extent prima facie rightness outweighs\nprima facie wrongness and then compare acts with each other\nin terms of their balance of prima facie rightness over\nprima facie wrongness and then determine which act has on\nbalance the greatest amount of prima facie rightness over\nprima facie wrongness. The act with the greatest balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness is\nwhat you ought all things considered to do and is therefore your\nactual obligation. The act which is one\u2019s actual duty is the one\nfor which one is most responsible or to which the weightier of\none\u2019s responsibilities attach of those acts open to one (FE 85;\nRG 41\u201342).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Ross says \u2018[t]his sense of our particular duty\nin particular circumstances, preceded and informed by the fullest\nreflection we can bestow on the act in all its bearings, is highly\nfallible, but it is the only guide we have to our [actual] duty\u2019\n(RG 42). We never know, then, what we actually ought to do in\na certain situation. Instead, we have a \u2018considered\nopinion\u2019 or \u2018probable opinion\u2019 regarding what we\nought to do in a particular situation (RG 19, 30, 31, 33; FE 189, 190,\n191; OJ 122, 123, 127). In the end, the decision regarding what to do\nsimpliciter, to use Aristotle\u2019s phrase, \u2018rests with\nperception\u2019 (RG 42; OJ 127; Aristotle1109b23, 1126b4). It is\nimportant to note all of the responsibilities have a valence, positive\nor negative, and this valence persists even when a responsibility is\noutweighed by weightier responsibilities. So if one\u2019s break a\npromise one owes compensation to the person to whom one has made the\npromise (RG 28).\n\nOne point of clarification. Ross says the act which is our actual duty\nor obligation in our situation is the one, out of the range of acts\nopen to us, with the greatest balance of prima facie\nrightness over prima facie wrongness. It is possible, of\ncourse, all acts open to us will have on balance a greater amount\nof prima facie wrongness over prima facie rightness.\nIn this case, one presumes, Ross will say our actual obligation is the\nact, of those open to us, with the least amount of prima\nfacie wrongness over prima facie rightness on\nbalance.\n\nIn addition, Ross seems not to have considered fully the possibility\nthat two acts open to us might be tied in terms of the amount of\nprima facie rightness over prime facie wrongness\nthey possess. If two or more acts are tied in this respect, there is\nno act of those open to us having the greatest balance of prima\nfacie rightness over prima facie wrongness. In such a\ncase there will appear to be a conflict of actual obligations. To\navoid saying this, Ross will have to modify his view to say our actual\nobligation in our situation is the act, of those open to us, with at\nleast as much prima facie rightness over prima facie\nwrongness as any other act open to us.\n\nRoss\u2019s epistemology may be attacked in a variety of different\nways.\n\nOne issue arises with respect to Ross\u2019s contrast between our\nknowledge of prima facie duties or responsibilities and our\nknowledge of our actual obligation in a situation. Ross thinks we have\ncertainty with respect to prima facie responsibilities (RG\n30), but only probable opinion of our actual duty. Our lack of\nknowledge of our actual duty is due in part to the difficulty of\ndetermining the precise weight of a prima facie duty or its\ndegree of obligatoriness (FE 188).\n\nOne may dissent from both the claim we have knowledge of or are\ncertain we have the prima facie responsibilities Ross says we\nhave and from the claim that we cannot know (in some perhaps lesser\nsense) our actual duty.\n\nIt is hard to believe we could ever be certain we have Ross\u2019s\nprima facie duties. Ross himself gives reasons for doubt. As\nnoted, in RG he says in his original discussion of prima\nfacie duties we have a prima facie duty of justice\n(pleasure apportioned to virtue) (RG 21). A duty of this sort would in\nsome way constrain our duty of beneficence. A few pages later he\nrevises his view and says justice is not a duty, but a good that ought\nto be promoted as a part of our obligation of beneficence in which\ncase it would not constrain our duty of beneficence (RG 27). But Ross\nis less than clear about exactly what he thinks. After it seems he has\nsettled on the idea justice is a good he seems to suggest he is not\nfully convinced saying again justice is a duty (RG 35; for the same\nview, see FE 71\u201372). This suggests uncertainty about a prima\nfacie duty justice. And we may have similar uncertainties about\nthe status of other duties, including the prima facie duty of\nfidelity to promises. We may be uncertain whether or not the duty to\nkeep one\u2019s promises constrains the duty of beneficence (for\ndiscussion, see Phillips 2019, 186\u201387).\n\nIn addition, it seems in some cases we can have quite a firm view of\nour actual duty. Consider a situation in which you have to acts open\nto you. You are walking to work to chat with a student you have\npromised to meet. On the way there you see a child drowning in a pond\nand only you can save her. If you save her, you will not be able to\nmeet your student; if you carry on to meet your student, the child\nwill drown. So, either you break a relatively trivial promise to meet\na student in your office hours or you save a drowning child. It seems\nclear to many that your actual obligation in this scenario is that you\nbreak the promise. True, it is likely that you cannot be certain of\nthis but you can be as certain of this as you can be of any prima\nfacie duty (for discussion, see Hurka, 2014, 124\u2013125; Phillips\n2019, 187\u201388; Price 1931, 344; Ross sometimes agrees; FE 191).\n\nAnother worry is there is very little agreement in intuitions or\nclaims to self-evidence. This suggests for some there is no fact of\nthe matter as to what has value or what one is responsible for. Ross\nconcedes there is a lot of disagreement. His response begins by noting\na lot of moral diversity rests not on \u2018disagreement about\nfundamental moral principles, but partly on differences in the\ncircumstances of different societies, and partly on different views\nwhich people hold, not on moral questions but on questions of\nfact\u2019 (FE 18). He thinks most of the differences concern\nmedia axiomata, i.e., attempts to apply general principles to\nparticular circumstances, which rest on different circumstances or\ndifferent factual beliefs (FE 18\u201319). About middle principles,\nhe says intuitionists must have an open mind (FE 190).\n\nMany differences cannot be explained away in this fashion, however (FE\n19). There are differences as to the \u2018comparative worth of\ndifferent goods\u2019 (FE 19) and as to the stringency of the\nresponsibilities Ross endorses (FE 186\u2013188). These disagreements\nshould not, he thinks, undermine our confidence that there is\nobjective moral truth. But it is very hard to see a resolution to\nthese problems. He says despite changes in scientific theories there\nis a sense science progresses toward the truth. The same is true in\nethics. There is no reason to \u2018doubt that man progresses fairly\nsteadily towards moral truth as he does towards scientific\u2019 (FE\n20). The difficulty with this response is whereas in scientific\nmatters there is an independent way of establishing progress, there is\nno such independent or seemingly independent way of establishing this\nin ethics. Recent research in the social sciences on moral judgement\nshould not leave us confident (Greene 2008; Singer 2005).\n\nThe problems with Ross\u2019s moral epistemology are compounded by\nthe fact he thinks the principles of his framework best reflect the\nmain elements of common-sense moral thinking, and that this is\nnecessary to an acceptable moral theory. This threatens to make his\nposition appear parochial (Hare 1971). He is aware of this worry. He\nreplies by saying the number of principles intuitionism endorses is\nsmall in number and general in content and this leaves room to reject\nmuch of what is commonly taken to be right (FE 190). He also insists\non the idea the list of duties (goods) he fixes on are a result of\nsober reflection on what we really think where this involves appeal to\nthought experiments and judgements about particular cases (for\ndiscussion, see Stratton-Lake 2002b, 114\u2013118). This seems like the\nright kind of move to make to avoid dogmatism.\n\nHowever, it puts him in a rather awkward position. If it really is\ntrue the number of principles is small and it is possible therefore to\nreject much of what is commonly recognized to be morally required, the\nposition has a more reformist edge, and to the extent it is reformist\nit is more rather than less like the other views Ross rejects. In this\ncase, it makes it much more difficult for him to fault his rivals for\nnot capturing common-sense morality or what the plain many thinks. If\nhe attempts to move more toward the plain man\u2019s view, then\nalthough he can more easily raise objections to ideal utilitarianism\nand other views, he is much more likely to lose his critical element\nand therefore less likely fend off the charge of parochialism. \n6. Ross\u2019s Moral Metaphysics\n\nLike many in his time, Ross took pains to undermine various\ndefinitions of moral terms. He draws a distinction between\nnaturalistic and non-naturalistic definitions. The former are\n\u2018definitions which claim to define an ethical term without using\nany other ethical term\u2019 (FE 6). The latter are definitions which\nattempt \u2018to define one ethical term by the aid of another\u2019\n(FE 6; cf. 42).\n\nRoss rejects all naturalistic definitions of moral terms, including\n\u2018right\u2019 and (intrinsic) \u2018good\u2019. In RG, he\nargues (following Moore 1912 and Sidgwick 1907) that the moral terms\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019 are incapable of\ndefinition: \u2018right\u2019 is an \u2018irreducible notion\u2019\n(RG 12). In FE, he suggests again \u2018right\u2019 is indefinable\n(FE 42), though he is sympathetic to the idea that \u2018right\u2019\nis definable in terms of \u2018suitable\u2019 (FE 52\u201355). On\nthis view, \u2018this act is right\u2019 means \u2018this act has\n\u201cthe greatest amount of suitability possible in the\ncircumstances\u201d\u2019 (FE 53; also 55). This is not a naturalist\ndefinition, since \u2018suitability\u2019 is itself a \u2018unique\nand indefinable\u2019 ethical notion (FE 146; also 159).\n\nIn RG, Ross appears to reject all naturalistic attempts to define\n\u2018good\u2019 (RG 78ff.). He is in particular keen to impugn\nviews providing relational accounts of \u2018good\u2019; that is,\nviews defining it in terms of some relation to a mental state, e.g.,\ndesire. His view appears to be that \u2018goodness is a quality which\ncan no more be defined in terms of anything other than itself, than\ncan the quality of the sensation which we describe as being one of\n\u201cseeing yellow\u201d\u2019 (RG 86). In FE, he seems to affirm\nthe view that \u2018good\u2019 is indefinable (FE 262), though again\nhe seems sympathetic to a non-naturalistic definition, according to\nwhich \u2018good\u2019 is definable in terms of\n\u2018admirable\u2019 or \u2018commendable\u2019 (FE 271, 283). He\nsays this sense of \u2018good\u2019 applies only to things that are\nintrinsically good in the sense of being objects worthy of admiration,\nand (as noted above) only virtue and intellectual activity are worthy\nof admiration (FE 283). The notion of \u2018good\u2019 as applied to\nthe goods of pleasure and justice can be defined relationally. These\ngoods are not objects worthy of admiration but rather fit objects of\nsatisfaction. Both notions of good are in a sense definable, but the\ndefinitions are non-natural: in both cases \u2018good\u2019 is\ndefined in terms of \u2018worthiness\u2019 or\n\u2018rightness\u2019 (FE 279, 282).\n\nRoss suggests a number of arguments against various (naturalistic and\nnon-naturalistic) definitions of moral terms. He relies in part on the\nfollowing kind of argument, which is directed at Moore (RG 8). If\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018being productive of the greatest good\nin the circumstances\u2019 mean the same thing, it is not the case it\nis intelligible the proposition \u2018the \u201cright act\u201d\njust is \u201cthe act productive of the greatest good in the\ncircumstances\u201d\u2019 should have been denied and maintained\n\u2018with so much fervour; for we do not fight for or against\nanalytic propositions\u2019 (RG 8). It is intelligible that these\npropositions should have been denied and maintained with so much\nfervour. Therefore, it is not the case that \u2018right\u2019 and\n\u2018productive of the greatest good in the circumstances\u2019\nmean the same thing. This argument can be generalised to reject the\nusual suspects, e.g., \u2018right\u2019 means \u2018approved of by\nme\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 means \u2018approved of by the\nmajority of society\u2019, and so on. But it is not the best\nargument, since we may well fight over analytic propositions,\nespecially when they are opaque or unobvious.\n\nRoss seems to acknowledge this sort of worry. He writes \u2018the\nfact that we accept some definition as correct shows that the term did\nsomehow stand for a complex of elements; yet the fact that we are for\nsome time in doubt about whether the term is analysable, and if so,\nwhat the correct analysis is, shows that this complex of elements was\nnot distinctly present to our mind before, or during, the search for a\ndefinition\u2019 (RG 92\u201393). In reply, he says the only way to\nrebut the claim \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 are\ndefinable (naturalistically) is to examine \u2018all the definitions\nthat possess any initial plausibility\u2019 (RG 93). To these we\nshould apply two tests (FE 259; RG 93). First, we should determine\nwhether \u2018the definition applies to all things to which the term\napplies, and to no others\u2019 (FE 259; also RG 93). Second, we\nshould ask whether the proposed definition expresses \u2018explicitly\nwhat we had implicitly in mind when we used the term\u2019 (FE 259;\nalso RG 93). Using these tools, Ross rejects (among others) the\nposition that \u2018this act is right\u2019 means \u2018all or most\nmen\u2026react to the act with a feeling of approval\u2019 (FE 24).\nWe often judge an act is right even when we know we are alone in\nholding this view (FE 25).\n\nThese are not the only arguments on which Ross relies. Against the\nview \u2018right\u2019 means \u2018awakes in me the emotion of\napproval\u2019 (FE 22), he argues it is unable to explain \u2018the\npossibility of difference of opinion on the rightness of acts\u2019\n(FE 24). On this view, if I say \u2018incest is impermissible\u2019\nand you say \u2018incest is permissible\u2019 we are not\ndisagreeing, since all I am saying is \u2018incest awakes in me the\nemotion of disapproval\u2019 and all you are saying is \u2018incest\nawakes in me the emotion of approval\u2019, two statements that\nappear to be \u2018perfectly compatible\u2019 with each other (FE\n24). But we want to say the two statements are not compatible. Ross\ngives the same argument against the claim \u2018X is\ngood\u2019 means \u2018I have a certain feeling toward\nX\u2019. If I say \u2018X is good\u2019 and you\nsay \u2018X is bad\u2019, you are saying you have a certain\n(negative) feeling toward X and I am saying I have a certain\n(positive) feeling toward X, two statements that seem to be\ncompatible with each other. Yet, he urges, \u2018if anything is\nclear, it is that we do suppose ourselves to be making incompatible\nstatements about the object\u2019 (RG 83).\n\nRoss also appears to reject various analyses of moral terms in order\nto preserve a certain way of conducting moral philosophy (Shaver 2007,\n286, 295). He notes \u2018there is a system of moral truth, as\nobjective as all truth must be, which, and whose implications, we are\ninterested in discovering\u2019 (RG 15; also 20, 29; KT 60). The\ndiscovery of these truths is not a matter of scientific\n(empirical) investigation. Ethical truths are not discovered by\n\u2018mere observation\u2019 (FE 7; also 168).\n\nInstead, they are \u2018grasped by an intuitive act of human\nreason\u2019 (FE 3). \u2018The use of the senses, and the physical\nsciences, give us no propositions in which \u2018right\u2019 or\n\u2018obligatory\u2019 occurs as a term\u2019 (KT 87). There are\n\u2018two types of predicate\u2014those that can be discovered by\nexperience to belong to their subjects, and those that can be\ndiscovered by insight, and let us grant that rightness belongs to the\nsecond class\u2019 (KT 81). In science,\n\u2018sense-experience\u2026furnishes\u2026real data\u2019 (RG\n40). In ethics, \u2018no such appeal is possible. We have no more\ndirect way of access to the facts about rightness and goodness and\nabout what things are right or good, than by thinking about\nthem\u2019 (RG 40; emphasis added; also 82).\n\nTo entrench this idea he draws analogies between mathematic and\nlogical knowledge and ethical knowledge (RG 29, 30, 32; KT 42, 85; FE\n320). He is fan of synthetic a priori truths in ethics (and\nelsewhere) (FE 35\u201336; also 320). Since it might be possible to\narrive at ethical knowledge by means of (mere) experience if moral\nterms were reducible to natural terms, this provides Ross with an\nincentive to show no such reduction is possible. He wants in short to\nprotect a moral methodology prizing appeal to what \u2018we\u2019\nthink, the thoughts of the \u2018best and most enlightened\u2019 (FE\n172), consensus amongst experts (OJ 119\u2013120; FE 191) and various\nkinds of thought experiments. Indeed, it has been suggested that\nthrough the use of these tools it is possible to demonstrate that\nthough \u2018right\u2019 is not synonymous with a natural property\nit nonetheless refers to some natural property, e.g., what has the\ngreatest balance of justice, beneficence, fidelity, and so on, over\ninjustice, non-maleficence and infidelity, and so on (Shaver 2007,\n289). (This may be controversial if such notions as\n\u2018justice\u2019 are incapable of complete naturalization. If\ncomplete naturalization is not an option, then Ross may be forced to\nendorse a less palatable metaphysics.)\n\nRoss holds the basic claims of morality express \u2018facts which are\nself-evidently necessary\u2019 (FE 320; also 262). Are these\nobjective facts of a special kind? The standard suggestion is for Ross\nmoral facts are non-natural facts or non-natural properties\n(Stratton-Lake 2002a, xxi; Frankena 1963, 86\u201387; 1973, 103). It\nis not clear he actually holds this view. He says very little about\nthe nature of moral facts except (perhaps unhelpfully) to compare them\nto mathematical and logical facts. He does not appear to infer from\nthe failure of naturalistic definitions of moral terms that the terms\nrefer to distinct properties. His focus is almost entirely on\ndefinitions of \u2018right\u2019 and (intrinsic) \u2018good\u2019.\nHis concern is with what \u2018we have in mind\u2019 not with\nproperties (FE 13, 42), though, problematically, he often refers to\n\u2018good\u2019 as a \u2018quality\u2019 or\n\u2018characteristic\u2019 or \u2018property\u2019 (RG 82, 87, 88,\n110, 122; FE 278, 279). He writes that \u2018the difference between\ngoodness or value and such attributes as yellowness is there whereas\nthe latter are differentiae\u2026of their possessors, the\nformer is a property (i.e. a consequential attribute) of\nthem\u2019 (RG 121; italics in original).\n\nIt is not clear Ross intends this view to be an inference from his\narguments against naturalistic or other analyses. That he offers no\nexplicit argument to this effect suggests he likely did not intend the\ninference (cf. Stratton-Lake 2002a), and he nowhere rules out that\nmoral properties are natural properties. At any rate, he does not need\nto make this inference to achieve the aims he has in rebutting the\nvarious definitions he discusses. The arguments he uses are sufficient\nto preserve (in his view) plausible moral semantics, moral\ndisagreement, and his moral methodology. This should please the\nadherents of this view, though it still leaves Ross with the task of\nmaking sense of the nature of moral truth if it is not to be\nunderstood as correspondence to the moral facts.\n\nRoss\u2019s appeal to self-evidence and his defence of the synthetic\na priori may seem problematic to many, though recent defences\nof these views suggest their fortunes are improving (Audi 1996, 2004;\nCrisp 2002; Parfit 2011; Stratton-Lake 2002a, 2002b). To defend\nhimself, Ross might simply eschew appeal to self-evidence and\ncertainty with respect to intuitions about general principles and\nreplace them with appeal to moral beliefs of high reliability or to\nconsidered convictions about moral claims (Griffin 1996; Hooker 2000;\nRawls 1971). This seems to give him what he needs methodologically\n(for discussion, see Irwin 2009, 686\u201390). The appeal to considered\nconvictions allows him the ability to say, for example, we know\ndirectly pain is bad and it is prima facie wrong to break\nyour promises; in addition, he can avoid the defects of coherence\ntheories of justification by holding there are at least some\npropositions not justified exclusively by coherence (FE 141; Ross\n1931, 61\u201362).\n\nThis (importantly) puts him on the same level as almost all moral\ntheorists working today. It is less clear Ross is able to divest\nhimself of synthetic a priori truths. But if his endorsement\nof synthetic a priori truths is one way of securing the\nstandard way of doing moral philosophy, which involves appeal to\nthought-experiments, intuition, what we think, and so on, it is more\ndifficult to reject. It is more difficult to reject still if we accept\nsuch claims in areas outside ethics and if we are not keen on (radical\nforms of) empiricism.\n7. Ross\u2019s Contemporary Importance\n\nRoss\u2019s contemporary importance to moral philosophy rests on his\nclarification and defence of a form of pluralistic deontology\nattempting to avoid the alleged deficiencies of utilitarianism without\nembracing the alleged excesses of Kantianism. The most distinctive\nfeature of this view is the notion of a prima facie duty or\nof a consideration counting in favour of or against an act, morally\nspeaking. Ross\u2019s view serves as an important source of\ninspiration for those dissatisfied with Kantianism and utilitarianism.\nRoss said little about issues in what we now call practical or applied\nethics. He belonged to a group of moral philosophers, including Moore,\nPrichard and others, for whom it was not important to work out views\non contemporary issues or to use moral philosophy to change the world\n(though see Ross 1929; RG 56\u201364, for his reflections on punishment;\nfor illuminating discussion of Ross\u2019s view, see Moriarty 2006;\nZimmerman 2011). Nevertheless, Ross\u2019s view has seen a resurgence\nin ethics and applied ethics (Audi 2004; Beauchamp and Childress 2008;\nPhillips 2019; Stratton-Lake 2011b).\n\nRoss also outlines a moral epistemology distinct from the coherentist\nreflective equilibrium that has held sway over moral philosophy for\nthe last fifty years. He relies on the idea that at the core of ethics\nthere are certain self-evident truths which can be discovered by\nreflection on what we think about moral and axiological questions.\nThose dissatisfied with the standard model for doing moral philosophy\nbut who at the same time find themselves attracted to the idea ethical\ntheories should capture the main elements of common-sense morality do\nwell to consult Ross\u2019s unique contribution to moral\nepistemology.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cellpad-small vert-top cell-rl\">\n<tr>", "[OJ]", "\u201cThe Basis of Objective Judgements in Ethics,\u201d\n<em>International Journal of Ethics</em>, 37(2) (1927):\n113\u2013127. </tr>\n<tr>", "[RG]", "<em>The Right and the Good</em>, Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 1930. </tr>\n<tr>", "[FE]", "<em>Foundations of Ethics</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n1939. </tr>\n<tr>", "[KT]", "<em>Kant\u2019s Ethical Theory: A Commentary on the</em> \nGrundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten, Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 1954. </tr>\n<tr>", "[AT]", "<em>Aristotle</em>, sixth edition, London: Routledge, 1995.\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h4>Other Papers (in ethics) by Ross</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Ross, W.
