    "main_text": "The Development of Feminist Bioethics || Emergence and early days\n1.2 Emergence and early days\n\nThe roots of feminist bioethics can be found in both feminist activism\nand feminist theory. In the early years of second wave feminism, the\nwomen\u2019s healthcare movement identified many areas where\nwomen\u2019s interests were severely neglected. While feminist\nactivism identified problematic areas and mobilized protest,\nthe academic critique provided a theoretical framework to\nshow that mainstream biomedicine and bioethics are fundamentally\ngendered in ways that affect both how the life sciences are researched\nand implemented and how this research and practice are\nethically analyzed. In other words, feminists were saying that not\nonly does bioethics give too little attention to gender-specific\ndisparities in healthcare research and treatment, but that the\ngendered perspective from which mainstream bioethics identifies\nmorally troubling issues and their ethically salient features makes it\nunable (or much less likely) to account adequately for certain\ninjustices, biases or harms in any given scenario (Tong 1997; Sherwin\n2008; Scully et al. 2010).\n\nIn its earliest phase, feminist bioethics focused on topics that were\npatently being neglected by the mainstream. Inevitably, these were\nareas that could traditionally be seen as \u201cwomen\u2019s\nissues\u201d: anything to do with reproduction, including abortion\nand the assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) emerging at that\ntime, but also the exclusion of women from medical research, the role\nof psychiatry and its treatment of women, and the increasing\nmedicalization and commodification of women\u2019s bodies. These\nperspectives cast new light on even well-examined terrain. For\nexample, although ethical issues within clinical research have been\nexhaustively mapped out, it took feminist analyses to highlight that\nthe routine exclusion of women from clinical research, on the grounds\nthat the \u201canomalies\u201d of female physiology generate\nunreliable data, was ethically problematic (Sherwin 1994; Baylis &\nHalperin 2012; Baylis & Ballantyne 2016).\n\nPioneering work included a ground-breaking anthology, Feminist\nPerspectives in Medical Ethics (Holmes & Purdy 1992), and the\nfirst monograph treatment of feminist bioethical theory, Susan\nSherwin\u2019s No Longer Patient: Feminist Ethics and Health\nCare, (Sherwin 1992). A major milestone was the publication of\nRosemary Tong\u2019s, Feminist Approaches to Bioethics:\nTheoretical Reflections and Practical Applications (Tong 1997).\nIn 1993, the International Network on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics\n(FAB) was founded and since 1996 has held its own biennial Congress in\nassociation with the World Congress on Bioethics. To further the\ndevelopment of feminist bioethics, in 2007 FAB established its own\njournal, the International Journal of Feminist Approaches to\nBioethics (IJFAB). From the outset, IJFAB has\nbeen committed to expanding the field of bioethics to include a wide\nrange of areas relevant to women\u2019s healthcare and related\nresearch.\n\nHowever, it is important to realize that feminist bioethics is\ncharacterized less by the areas that it addresses or ethical theories\nthat it draws on, than by its particular approach to ethical analysis.\nThe combination of attention to practical issues, distinctive\nconceptual commitments, and the explicit ethical-political goal of\nachieving equality and justice for women is the hallmark of feminist\nbioethics. The following sections will first identify the feminist\nperspectives on ontology and epistemology that are foundational to\nthis approach; show how these commitments shape feminist approaches to\nbioethical analyses; and then outline two areas of theory, care ethics\nand relational autonomy, that have been developed within feminist\nbioethics and have also enriched theoretical bioethics more generally.\nFinally, this entry considers the future of feminist bioethics in the\ntwenty-first century.\n",
