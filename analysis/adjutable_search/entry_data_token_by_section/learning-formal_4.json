    "main_text": "Convergence to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth || Falsificationism and Generalizations with Exceptions\n1.4 Falsificationism and Generalizations with Exceptions\n\nOur first two examples feature simple universal generalizations. Some\nsubtle aspects of the concept of long-run reliability, particularly\nits relationship to falsificationism, become apparent if we consider\ngeneralizations that allow for exceptions. To illustrate, let us\nconsider another ornithological example. Two competing hypotheses are\nunder investigation.\n\nAll but finitely many swans are white. That is, basically all\nswans are white, except for a finite number of exceptions to the rule.\n\nAll but finitely many swans are black. That is, basically all\nswans are black, except for a finite number of exceptions to the\nrule.\n\n\nAssuming that one or the other of these hypotheses is correct, is\nthere an inductive method that reliably settles on the right one? What\nmakes this problem more difficult than our first two is that each\nhypothesis under investigation is consistent with any finite amount of\nevidence. If 100 white swans and 50 black swans are found, either the\n50 black swans or the 100 white swans may be the exception to the\nrule. In terminology made familiar by\n Karl Popper\u2019s\n work, we may say that neither hypothesis is falsifiable. As a\nconsequence, the inductive strategy from the previous two examples\nwill not work here. This strategy was basically to adopt a\n\u201cbold\u201d universal generalization, such as \u201call ravens\nare black\u201d or \u201call emeralds are green\u201d, and to hang\non to this conjecture as long as it \u201cpasses muster\u201d.\nHowever, when rules with possible exceptions are under investigation,\nthis strategy is unreliable. For example, suppose that an inquirer\nfirst adopts the hypothesis that \u201call but finitely many swans\nare white\u201d. It may be the case that from then on, only black\nswans are found. But each of these apparent counterinstances can be\n\u201cexplained away\u201d as an exception. If the inquirer follows\nthe principle of hanging on to her conjecture until the evidence is\nlogically inconsistent with the conjecture, she will never abandon her\nfalse belief that all but finitely many swans are white, much less\narrive at the correct belief that all but finitely many swans are\nblack.\n\nReliable inquiry requires a more subtle investigative strategy. Here\nis one (of many). Begin inquiry with either competing hypothesis, say\n\u201call but finitely many swans are black\u201d. Choose some\ncut-off ratio to represent a \u201cclear majority\u201d; for\ndefiniteness, let\u2019s say 70%. If the current conjecture is that\nall but finitely many swans are black, change your mind to conjecture\nthat all but finitely many swans are white just in case over 70% of\nobserved swans are in fact white. Proceed likewise if the current\nconjecture is that all but finitely many swans are white when over 70%\nof observed swans are in fact black.\n\nA bit of thought shows that this rule reliably identifies the correct\nhypothesis in the long run, no matter which of the two competing\nhypotheses is correct. For if all but finitely many swans are black,\neventually the nonblack exceptions to the rule will be exhausted, and\nan arbitrarily large majority of observed swans will be black.\nSimilarly if all but finitely many swans are white.\n\nGeneralizations with exceptions illustrate the relationship between\nPopperian falsificationism and the learning-theoretic idea of reliable\nconvergence to the truth. In some settings of inquiry, notably those\ninvolving universal generalizations, a naively Popperian\n\u201cconjectures-and-refutations\u201d approach of hanging on to\nconjectures until the evidence falsifies them does yield a reliable\ninductive method. In other problems, like the current example, it does\nnot. Relying on falsifications is sometimes, but not always,\nthe best way for inquiry to proceed. Learning theory has provided\nmathematical theorems that clarify the relationship between a\nconjectures-and-refutations approach and reliable inquiry. The details\nare discussed in\n Section 3\n (The Limits of Inquiry and the Complexity of Empirical Problems).\nGenerally speaking methods that solve a learning problem with\nunfalsifiable hypotheses can be represented as employing a refined\nhypothesis space where the original hypotheses are replaced by\nstrengthened hypotheses that  are  falsifiable.\n",
