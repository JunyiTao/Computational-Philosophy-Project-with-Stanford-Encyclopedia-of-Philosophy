    "main_text": "Political and Feminist Thought || Philosophy of State\n4.1 Philosophy of State\n\nStein\u2019s treatise An Investigation Concerning the State\n(1925) completes her preoccupation with social reality\n(1917\u20131925). The aim of the book is to provide an\n\u201contic\u201d determination of the state as a form of sociality.\nThe guiding question Stein sets out to answer is what \u201ctype of\nliving together of subjects\u201d is distinctive of the state.\n\nAccording to Stein, the state cannot be grounded in either\n\u201csociety\u201d or in \u201ccommunity\u201d alone. Unlike\nsocieties or associations, a state cannot be brought into existence by\nany act of collective intentionality or \u201cvolition\u201d.\nPolitical entities, founded solely on such rational associations,\nwould at best be \u201cartificial\u201d quasi-states, permanently in\ndanger of dissolving, like the artificial territories drawn up on maps\nof colonial powers (1925: 81[107]). Stein aims to show that states\nwill be \u201cpeculiarly hollow and schematic\u201d if they are not\nin some sense or another grounded in communal forms of living together\n(1925: 32[37]). However, no \u201ccommunity of the\npeople\u201d\u2014be it an ethnically defined \u201cpeople\u201d\nor \u201cfolk\u201d or some other cultural community founded on\nshared values or languages\u2014is a necessary or sufficient\ncondition to constitute a state either. Accordingly, Stein argues both\nagainst classical contractualism \u00e0 la Rousseau, Locke or Hobbes\n(1925: 40[51]), that asserts a rational but decisionist creation\nof the state (Sch\u00f6pfung kraft eines Willk\u00fcraktes),\nand against traditionalist conceptions of some organic emergence of a\nstate. For Stein, there is no \u201ceither-or\u201d here: though\nstates may be factually \u201cgrounded\u201d in a community or a\nsociety, statehood is not constituted by either (1925:\n7\u20139[4\u20136]). The \u201cgravitational force [of a state]\nrests on its own\u201d (1925: 81[108]). Less metaphorically, a state\nconstitutes itself by its own sovereign act\n\nThe central thesis of the book, then, focuses on the\n\u201cequivalence of statehood and sovereignty\u201d (1925: 17[16]).\nSovereignty is not only the \u201cthe conditio sine qua non\nof the state\u201d (1925: 51[66]), it also represents its defining\nnature. A state is essentially a \u201csovereign sphere of\npower\u201d (Herrschaftssph\u00e4re) with its own\n\u201cgoverning state-power (Staatsgewalt)\u201d.\nSpecifically, the sovereignty of a state is a (self-)constitutive\npower, instituting not just the state as such, but also its law or\nrights (Recht). Hence, \u201cstate and law come to life at\nthe same time\u201d (1925: 48[62]). A state thus bears the exclusive\n\u201cright to institute laws\u201d (Recht, Recht zu\nsetzen) and determines the sphere of persons (and specific forms\nof their behavior) for whom those laws apply (1925: 34[40]).\n\nStein spends a considerable portion of the treatise specifying the\nnature of rights and law at stake. In particular, she differentiates\nbetween positive and pure law, subjective, natural, human and civil\nrights, discusses the function of the state in interpreting,\nenforcing, or adjudicating rights as well as the legal and ontological\nstatus of the state itself as a subject of law (1925: 40[51],\n56\u201373[73\u201396]). Drawing on Reinach (1913), she first distinguishes\n\u201cpure\u201d and \u201cpositive law\u201d. Pure law is\na-temporal and applies universally \u201cat all times and for all\npeoples\u201d (1925: 33[39]); whereas positive law is created by\nspontaneous decisions and hence can vary socio-historically. Based on\nthis distinction, Stein argues that, \u201cwherever there is no idea\nof a positive law, the idea of a state can (\u2026) neither be\ngrasped\u201d (1925: 64[84]).\n\nBut in what sense is the state, as a sovereign entity, the originator\n(Urheber) of its own (positive) rights and powers and in what\nsense is it a unitary \u201csubject of right\u201d\n(Rechtsubjekt) of its own? The gist of Stein\u2019s complex\nand somewhat ambivalent discussion (1925: 52\u201362[68\u201383]) is\nthat \u201cbeing a state means being a subject of\nrights\u201d (1925: 119[172]), namely in the sense of a\n\u201cjuridical person\u201d. Juridical persons are persons only in\na derivative sense; they derive their ability to perform \u201cfree\nacts\u201d, from fully-fledged individual (natural) persons (1925: 37[46]). The state, then, is the \n\n\nnon-personal entity, the subject, to which all [individual] rights,\ninasmuch they are of a positive-legal source, point back to as their\nultimate originator. (1925: 59[77]) \n\n\nOn the other hand, Stein applies her account of collective\nintentionality (see\n sect. 2.4)\n to the theory of the state as a \u201ccollective person\u201d\n(\u201cKollektiv-Person\u201d). A key assumption is that\nthe state can only be a unitary, sovereign subject \n\n\nif there is a sense, in which it can be claimed that it is, as a\ntotality (als Ganzes), author (Urheber) of\nits own acts. (1925: 37[46]) \n\n\nThe state, as a collective subject of right, represents individuals\nand communities, which empowers individuals, associations or\ninstitutions to act on behalf of the state. But they can only act on\nbehalf of the state if they are, in turn, \u201coffered\u201d to do\nso (angetragen) and thus legitimized by the state itself\n(1925: 38[47]). Moreover, individuals and communities must acknowledge\nor recognize (anerkennen) the state\u2019s self-institution\nand its executive and legislative powers.\n\nWith her detailed analysis of the sovereignty of the state and the\nspecific workings of its rule of law, Stein contributes in an original\nway to later\u2014and very different\u2014attempts to clarify the\nconcept of the state: in particular, Carl Schmitt\u2019s definition\nof politics in terms of state\u2019s unique sovereignty and ability\nto lead war (Schmitt 1932), and Hannah Arendt\u2019s account of the\nrole of nation states in integrating pluralities of individuals and\ncommunities into a single body politic, namely by\ntheir\u2014ever-vulnerable\u2014sovereignty to establish and enforce\nthe rule of law (e.g., in Arendt 1951).\n\nStein also discusses the ethical value and possible moral obligations\nof the state, as well as its role \u201cas a bearer of historical\nevents\u201d. For Stein, the state doesn\u2019t have any proper\nethical value; rather, values can only be attributed to their\nunderlying communities (1925: 111[152]). Accordingly, the state cannot\nbe an ethical subject (1925: 119[172]). The reason is that values and\nthe obligation to realize or facilitate them can only be\n\u201cacknowledged in acts of feeling\u201d (see also\n sect. 2.2);\n \u201cthe state is not capable of such acknowledgment\n(Kenntnisnahme), and in particular incapable of\nfeeling\u201d (ibid.). Ultimately, then, the state can act freely,\nand indeed remain a lawful or rightful state, without giving any\nconsideration to ethical norms. However, that doesn\u2019t exclude\nthat, via individual state representatives, the state remains\n\u201cin touch\u201d with the moral domain and is affected by\nethical demands.\n\nAgainst the German Idealist tradition, Stein argues that the ethical\nidea of the state does not lie in the historical development of\nindividual freedom (1925: 122[177]); freedom cannot\n\u201cdevelop\u201d but is either given or not, and can at best be\nonly secured by the state. Rather, the only ethical role of the state\nlies in the \u201cformation of a sensitivity\u201d for positive\nspiritual and ethical values and the facilitation of the freedom to\nrealize those values, or the \u201ccreation of culture\u201d (1925:\n124\u2013125[181]). This partly resonates with Arendt\u2019s famous\ndictum that \u201cfreedom is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre\nof politics\u201d (Arendt 1961: 146). Yet, and this is where Arendt\nand Stein would arguably part ways, the state has only a facilitating\nrole, even if the historically most powerful one, in \u201crealizing\nvalues\u201d\u2014which is the very \u201csense of history\u201d\n(1925: 126[184]). For Stein, there is nothing in the ontic nature of\nstate that could ethically demand this role.\n",
