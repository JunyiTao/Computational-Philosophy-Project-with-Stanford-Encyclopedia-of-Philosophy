    "main_text": "Abstract objects and universals || Universals\n2.2 Universals\n\n\nThe nominalist about universals rejects universals \u2014 but what\nare they? The distinction between particulars and universals is usually\ntaken to be both exhaustive and exclusive, but whether there is such a\ndistinction is \n controversial.[5] \n The distinction can be drawn in terms of\na relation of instantiation: we can say that something is a universal\nif and only if it can be instantiated (whether\nit can be instantiated by particulars or universals) \u2014 otherwise\nit is a particular. Thus while both particulars and universals can\ninstantiate entities, only universals can be instantiated. If\nwhiteness is a universal then every white thing is an instance\nof it. But the things that are white, e.g. Socrates, cannot have any\n instances.[6]\n\n\nRealists about universals typically think that properties (e.g.\nwhiteness), relations (e.g. betweenness), and kinds (e.g. gold) are\nuniversals. Where do universals exist? Do they exist in the things that\ninstantiate them? Or do they exist outside them? To maintain the second\noption is to maintain an ante rem realism about universals. If\nuniversals exist outside their instances then it is plausible to\nsuppose that they exist outside space and time. If so, assuming their\nconsequent causal inertness, universals are abstract objects. To\nmaintain that universals exist in their instances is to maintain an\nin re realism about universals. If universals exist in their\ninstances, and their instances exist in space or time, then it is\nplausible to think that universals exist in space or time, in which\ncase they are concrete. In this case universals can be multiply\nlocated, i.e. they can occupy more than one place at the same time, for\nin re universals are wholly located at each place they occupy\n(thus if there is whiteness in re, then such a thing can be\nsix meters apart from itself).\n\n\nThus, both on ante rem and in re realism about\nuniversals, universals enjoy a relation with space very different from\nthat apparently enjoyed by ordinary objects of experience like houses,\nhorses and men. For such particulars are located in space and time and cannot\nbe located in more than one place at the same time. But universals are\neither not located in space or else they can occupy more than one place\nat the same time.\n",
