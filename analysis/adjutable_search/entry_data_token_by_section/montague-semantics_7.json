    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects || Compositionality\n3.2 Compositionality\n\nFor Montague the principle of compositionality did not seem to be a\nsubject of deliberation or discussion, but the only way to proceed. In\neffect he made compositionality the core part of his \u2018theory of\nmeaning\u2019 (Montague 1970c, 378), which was later summed up in the\nslogan: \u2018Syntax is an algebra, semantics is an algebra, and\nmeaning is a homomorphism between them\u2019 (Janssen 1983, 25). Yet\nalthough Montague used the term \u2018Frege\u2019s functionality\nprinciple\u2019 for the way in which extension and intension are\ncompositionally intertwined, he did not have a special term for\ncompositionality in general. Later authors, who identified the\nPrinciple of Compositionality as a cornerstone of Montague\u2019s\nwork, also used the term \u2018Frege\u2019s Principle\u2019\n(originating with Cresswell 1973, 75); Thomason 1980 is an early\nsource for the term \u2018compositional\u2019.\n\nIt has been claimed that Montague\u2019s analysis of pronouns is not compositional. This is, however, not the case. In order to\nexplain the compositional nature of his treatment of pronouns, both\nJanssen (1997) and Dowty (2007) explain how variables are interpreted\nin logic; we follow their explanations. Consider the following clauses\nfrom the traditional Tarskian interpretation of predicate logic.\n\n\\(\\llbracket \\varphi \\wedge \\psi \\rrbracket^g = \\mathbf{1}\\) if\nand only if \\(\\llbracket \\varphi \\rrbracket^g = \\mathbf{1}\\) and\n\\(\\llbracket \\psi \\rrbracket^g = \\mathbf{1}\\)\n\\(\\llbracket \\exists \\ x\\varphi \\rrbracket^g = \\mathbf{1}\\) if and\nonly if for some \\(h, h \\sim_x g\\) and \\(\\llbracket \\varphi \\rrbracket^h\n= \\mathbf{1}\\)\n\n\nThe first clause says: \\(\\varphi \\wedge \\psi\\) is true when using\nassignment \\(g\\) if and only if \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are true when\nthe assignment \\(g\\) is used. In the second clause assignments \\(h\\)\nare introduced (by \\(\\sim_x g)\\) which are equal to \\(g\\) except maybe\nfor the value they assign to variable \\(x\\). Montague uses the same\nformat, with the difference that besides \\(g\\) he also has \\(i\\), the\ntime of reference and \\(j\\), the possible world, as superscripts.\n\nIn the formulation of the clauses there is nothing which can be\npointed at as \u2018the meaning\u2019, in fact it is a definition of\ntruth with \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) as parameters. So how is it possible that\nthis (and Montague\u2019s work) are compositional?\n\nThe answer requires a shift in perspective. The meaning of a formula\n\\(\\varphi\\), shortly \\(M(\\varphi)\\), is the set of assignments for\nwhich the formula is true. Then the first clause says that\n\n\\[ M(\\varphi \\wedge \\psi) = M(\\varphi) \\cap M(\\psi), \\]\n\n\nso a simple set-theoretic combination on the two meanings is\nperformed. And \n\n\\[ M(\\exists x \\ \\varphi) = \\{g \\sim_x h\\mid h \\in M(\\varphi)\\}, \\]\n\n\ni.e., \\(\\{g \\mid \\text{for some }h \\in\nM(\\varphi), g \\sim_x h \\}\\), which can be described as: extend the set\n\\(M(\\varphi)\\) with all \\(x\\)-variants. (The reference to\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 may be felt as problematic, but Montague even\neliminated this trace of non-compositionality by assigning appropriate\nmeanings to variables; see Zimmermann and Sternefeld 2013, ch. 10, for\npertinent details.) In general, in Montague semantics the meaning of\nan expression is a function which has as domain the triples\n\\(\\langle\\)moment of time, possible world, assignment to\nvariables\\(\\rangle\\).\n\nIs it possible to achieve compositionality for natural language?\nObvious candidates for counterexamples are idioms, because their\nmeanings seem not to be built from their constituting words. However,\nWesterst\u00e5hl (2002) presents a collection of methods, varying\nfrom compound basic expressions, to deviant meanings for constituting\nparts. Janssen (1997) refutes several other counterexamples that are\nput forward in the literature.\n\nHow strong is compositionality? Mathematical results show that any\nlanguage can be given a compositional semantics, either by using an\nunorthodox syntax (Janssen 1997) or by using an unorthodox semantics\n(Zadrozny 1994). However their proofs are not helpful in practice.\nHodges (2001) showed under which circumstances a given compositional\nsemantics for a fragment can be extended to a larger language.\n\nThere is no general agreement among formal semanticists about the role\nand status of compositionality; at least the following four positions\nhave been held (nearly the same list is given in Partee 1996):\n\nCompositionality is a basic methodological principle; any proposal\nshould obey it. Janssen (1997) and Jacobson (2014) are adherents of\nthis position.\nCompositionality is a good method, but other methods can be used\nas well. For instance formal meaning representation can be used in an\nessential way. An example is DRT (discourse representation theory,\nKamp 1981).\nCompositionality is an ideal, but a proposal need not satisfy\nit.\nIt is an empirical issue whether compositionality can be achieved.\nSee Dowty 2007 for a discussion.\n\n\nAn extensive discussion of compositionality is given in Janssen 1997,\nand in the entry on\n compositionality.\n",
