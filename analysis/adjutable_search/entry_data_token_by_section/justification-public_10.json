    "main_text": "Foundations of the Public Justification Principle\n4. Foundations of the Public Justification Principle\n\nNow we inquire into the foundations of the PJP. Why should anyone\naccept it? The set of proposed normative foundations has increased\nwith time. Classically, public justification rests on respect for\npersons as free and equal. (See Larmore 2008; for criticism, see\nEberle 2002, Gaus 2011 and Van Schoelandt 2015). Others ground the PJP\nin an analysis of the nature of rationality and morality (Habermas\n1996). One dominant view bases the PJP on requirements of justice\n(Rawls 2005: Quong 2013). Some draw on the value of civic friendship.\n(See Lister 2013, Ebels-Duggan 2010, Leland and van Wietmarschen 2017,\nvan Wietmarschen 2021, Neufeld 2022. For criticism, see Billingham\n2016.) Gaus adopts a PJP because he argues that publicly justified\nrules avoid authoritarianism and fit with the reactive attitudes (for\ncriticism, see Tahzib 2019, Taylor 2018). At a deeper moral level,\nthese rules preserve moral relations between persons. (Gaus 2011,\nVallier 2022. For criticism, see Enoch 2013 and Enoch 2015.)\n\nWatson and Hartley (2018) rest public justification on respect for\npersons and reciprocity. Vallier (2019, 2020) grounds a PJP in the\nvalue of social trust or trust between members of society (though see\nTahzib 2021). Neo-Hobbesian views have seen a revival in the work of\nMoehler (2018) and Vanderschraaf (2018); they have much more developed\ntheories of instrumental rationality as a basis for public\njustification.\n\nFor space purposes, I omit a discussion of these foundations, as it\nwould only recapitulate the argument found in the entry on\n public reason.\n\nA related foundational question asks who merits a public justification\nin the first place (this question relates to the question of the scope\nof public justification, but is logically prior to it). Quong (2011,\n137\u2013160) applies public justification to an idealized\nconstituency of reasonable people. Gaus (2011, 232\u2013268) directs\npublic justification to actual persons; their justifying reasons are\nthose that survive moderate idealization. Quong calls his view the\n\u201cinternal conception\u201d of political liberalism. He\ncontrasts it with the \u201cexternal conception.\u201d The external\nconception directs public justification to natural persons as they\nare. But few public reason liberals adopt the external view. The\nGausian model appeals to a limited idealization, not none. The\ninternal conception has been subject to several criticisms. (Gaus\n2012, Billingham 2017a, Vallier 2017). But theorists also criticize\nthe Gausian approach (Enoch 2013, Quong 2014).\n\nDeciding who merits a public justification requires explaining its\npoint. For Quong and others, public justification renders consistent\nour fundamental political ideals. Examples include the idea of society\nas a system of cooperation and persons as free and equal. For Gaus,\npublic justification establishes moral relations between natural\npersons (Gaus 2011). These relations are ones of equal respect. But\nthey also lay the foundation for closer ties of trust, love, and\nfriendship.\n\nThe internal/external conception contrast no longer serves to classify\npublic reason liberals. Vallier and Muldoon (2021) have argued that\npublic reason has split into two projects. The first project, which\nthey call the coherence project, characterizes the internal\nconception; it involves rendering our political ideals consistent. The\nproject contrasts with the diversity project; diversity\ntheorists use diverse reasoning to achieve real-world public\njustification. Vallier and Muldoon (2021) set the external conception\naside.\n\nThe original project, advanced by Rawls and traditional\nRawlsians, continues (Weithman 2011). But the coherence and diversity\nprojects arose from a shared worry about it. Rawls uses both consensus\nand convergence reasoning in legitimizing state coercion. We first\njustify a conception of justice based on shared values, and we then\nsee if it can become the object of an overlapping consensus. Coherence\ntheorists say the first stage is critical, while the second stage is\nconfusing. But diversity theorists say the second stage is necessary\nas a heuristic for finding points of convergence. Original project\ntheorists refuse to choose between these two justificatory stages.\n\nFor the most recent work in the coherence project, see Neufeld 2022.\nFor the most recent work in the diversity project, see Gaus 2021.\nGaus\u2019s work has pushed public reason so far in a diversity\ndirection that in some ways it is no longer a form of social contract\ntheory (Gaus 2018). Gaus now models the choice of principles as a\nsocially interdependent choice process, and not a single agreement.\nGaus even began developing a research program based on these insights\ncalled the New Diversity Theory (Gaus 2018b).\n",
