    "main_text": "The base theory || The choice of the base theory\n2.1 The choice of the base theory\nIn most axiomatic theories, truth is conceived as a predicate of\nobjects. There is an extensive philosophical discussion on the\ncategory of objects to which truth applies: propositions conceived as\nobjects that are independent of any language, types and tokens of\nsentences and utterances, thoughts, and many other objects have been\nproposed. Since the structure of sentences considered as types is\nrelatively clear, sentence types have often been used as the objects\nthat can be true. In many cases there is no need to make very specific\nmetaphysical commitments, because only certain modest assumptions on\nthe structure of these objects are required, independently from\nwhether they are finally taken to be syntactic objects, propositions\nor still something else. The theory that describes the properties of\nthe objects to which truth can be attributed is called the base\ntheory. The formulation of the base theory does not involve the\ntruth predicate or any specific truth-theoretic assumptions. The base\ntheory could describe the structure of sentences, propositions and the\nlike, so that notions like the negation of such an object can then be\nused in the formulation of the truth-theoretic axioms.\nIn many axiomatic truth theories, truth is taken as a predicate\napplying to the G\u00f6del numbers of sentences. Peano arithmetic has\nproved to be a versatile theory of objects to which truth is applied,\nmainly because adding truth-theoretic axioms to Peano arithmetic\nyields interesting systems and because Peano arithmetic is equivalent\nto many straightforward theories of syntax and even theories of\npropositions. However, other base theories have been considered as\nwell, including formal syntax theories and set theories.\nOf course, we can also investigate theories which result by adding\nthe truth-theoretic axioms to much stronger theories like set\ntheory. Usually there is no chance of proving the consistency of set\ntheory plus further truth-theoretic axioms because the consistency of\nset theory itself cannot be established without assumptions\ntranscending set theory. In many cases not even relative consistency\nproofs are feasible. However, if adding certain truth-theoretic axioms\nto PA yields a consistent theory, it seems at least plausible that\nadding analogous axioms to set theory will not lead to an\ninconsistency. Therefore, the hope is that research on theories of\ntruth over PA will give an some indication of what will happen when we\nextend stronger theories with axioms for the truth predicate. However, Fujimoto (2012)\n has shown that some axiomatic truth theories over set theory differ from their counterparts over Peano arithmetic in some aspects.\n",
