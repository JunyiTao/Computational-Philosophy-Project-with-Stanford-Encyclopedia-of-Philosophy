    "main_text": "Post-Avicennian Period\n8. Post-Avicennian Period\n\nThe pivotal position of Avicenna in the history of Islamic philosophy\nemerges in all clarity if we consider that the three approaches to\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics considered here\n(classification, commentary, adaptation), as well as the main schools\nof thought of the formative period (the Kindian, on the one hand, and\nthe Farabian-Baghdadian, on the other), ended or began to wither with\nthe rise of Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics. Although the text of\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics continued to circulate in\nArabic after the eleventh century, the metaphysical works of Avicenna\ngradually superseded the Metaphysics as the text to be\ncopied, commented upon, and evaluated (either favorably or\ncritically), until Avicennism replaced Aristotelianism by\nincorporating it. Likewise, in the post-Avicennian tradition, issues\nregarding Avicenna\u2019s distinction between essence and existence,\nand the primacy of the former over the latter, are widely debated, and\nthe prerogatives of an Avicennian philosophical theology over Islamic\ndialectical theology, or kal\u0101m, to be the discipline\nmore properly entitled to speak about God, hold pivotal\nimportance.\n\nThe reception of Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics in subsequent Arabic\nthought is multifaceted, and detailed work in this immense area has\nonly begun in recent decades. Previous scholarship has established the\nfollowing landmarks:\n\nFirst, a clear distinction between the direct vs. the indirect\ninfluence of Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics, i.e., between those who\nactually consulted his works, and those whose knowledge depended on\nearlier readers of Avicenna. A case of the latter are the two very\ninfluential text-books of Coranic schools (madrasas), A\u1e6f\u012br\nal-D\u012bn al-Abhar\u012b\u2019s (d. 660H/1262 or 663H/1265),\nHid\u0101yat al-\u1e25ikma, and Na\u01e7m al-D\u012bn\nal-K\u0101tib\u012b al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b (d. 1276), \u1e24ikmat\nal-\u02bfayn, whose metaphysical sections are largely dependent\non Avicenna.\n\nSecond, three main attitudes towards Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics in\npost-Avicennian Arabic philosophy can tentatively be outlined:\nacceptance; revision; and rejection of Avicenna\u2019s standpoint. A\ndecidedly pro-Avicennian camp is represented by a network of scholars\nencompassing at least three generations of school members who\nexplicitly connected themselves with Avicenna\u2019s teaching.\nSignificantly, some of these direct disciples of Avicenna, like\nAb\u016b l-\u02bfAbb\u0101s Fa\u1e0dl Ibn Mu\u1e25ammad\nal-Lawkar\u012b (V-VI/XI-XII c.), are the models to which later heirs\nof Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics ideally refer (see, for instance,\n\u0120iy\u0101\u1e6f al-D\u012bn Man\u1e63\u016br ibn Mu\u1e25ammad\n\u1e24usayn\u012b Da\u0161tak\u012b \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b,\nd. 948H/1542).\n\nOn the opposite side, a \u201cconservative\u201d reaction to\nAvicenna\u2019s metaphysics (and to Avicenna\u2019s philosophy in\ngeneral) was represented by the efforts of reinstating the\npre-Avicennian status of this discipline. This goal was pursued in\nvarious ways. Some, like \u0160ih\u0101badd\u012bn\nal-Suhraward\u012b (d. 1191) and the fabricators of Arabic\nPseudo-Platonica in the twelfth century, took Pythagoras\u2019 and\nPlato\u2019s thought as true philosophy, thus supplanting the\nAristotelian tradition to which Avicenna belonged. Others, like Ibn\nRushd/Averroes (d. 1198), whose three commentaries on the\nMetaphysics contain recurrent criticisms of Avicenna,\nredirected attention to the Aristotelian Metaphysics itself,\nwith the aim of restoring the original purport of Aristotle\u2019s\nfoundational text against Avicenna\u2019s innovations. Still others,\nsuch as \u02bfAbd al-La\u1e6d\u012bf al-Ba\u0121d\u0101d\u012b (d.\n1231), conceived metaphysics as a mere juxtaposition of the Kindian\nand Farabian perspectives on metaphysics, where Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics inaugurates a curriculum of works that includes\nthe Liber de causis and the Theologia Aristotelis,\nas in al-Kind\u012b, but also has an ontological dimension, as in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, so that the Avicennian synthesis is reduced\nto its constituents. In addition to these anachronistic attempts that\nsurface both in the East and in the West of the Muslim world and are\nadvanced by philosophers in the strict sense, there were also the\nattacks launched against philosophy in general, and metaphysics in\nparticular, by Muslim theologians, most famously by Ab\u016b\n\u1e24\u0101mid al-\u0120az\u0101l\u012b (d. 1111) in The\nIncoherence of the Philosophers (Tah\u0101fut\nal-Fal\u0101sifa). Significantly, however, all the critics of\nAvicenna, regardless whether philosophers or theologians, are also\nindebted to his thought, and in their eyes Avicenna\u2019s\nmetaphysics represents metaphysics tout court.\n\nA further intermediate line of influence, which is the one that\nultimately prevails, is the fruitful and positive\n\u201ccontamination\u201d of Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics with\nsystems of thought originally foreign to it. This trend towards\ncombining approaches and developing in new directions takes place, for\nexample, with regard to the theory of illumination (Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn\nMa\u1e25m\u016bd al-\u0160ahraz\u016br\u012b, 2nd half\nof the VII/XIIIc.), or to sufism (Mu\u1e25y\u012b\u02be al-D\u012bn\nIbn \u02bfArab\u012b, d. 1240; Ibn Sab\u02bf\u012bn of Murcia, c.\n1217\u20131270; \u1e62adr al-D\u012bn al Q\u016bnaw\u012b,\n1207\u20131274). But the most noteworthy aspect of this\ntendency\u2014which possibly starts in the cultural environment where\nal-\u0120az\u0101l\u012b was formed\u2014is the adoption of\nAvicenna\u2019s metaphysics by Muslim theologians or\nmutakallim\u016bn. In general, the tendency to integrate\nAvicenna\u2019s metaphysics into new doctrinal settings represents\nthe most interesting area of the reception of Avicenna\u2019s\nthought, since it requires a thorough revision of Avicenna\u2019s\noriginal stance to adapt it to an illuminationist, mystical, or\ntheological context. Together with the trends towards acceptance or\nrejection, this tendency to revise stretches over a period which is\nmuch longer than the pre-Avicennian phase of falsafa.\n\nThird, in a diachronic perspective, within the vast scenario of the\nreception of Avicenna\u2019s philosophy, after the first main period\nof impact already singled out in scholarship (from Avicenna\u2019s\ndeath until the middle of the VIII/XIV c.), further later significant\nphases of influence in different areas of the Islamic world (Persia,\nIndia, Ottoman empire) are emerging. Of course, this temporal\nprogression and this geographical expansion also involve\nmetaphysics.\n\nA key factor in the evaluation of the later impact of Avicenna\u2019s\nmetaphysics is the assessment of those of his works which mainly\ninfluenced later reflections on metaphysics, their ways of\ntransmission, and their audience, since each of them, as we have seen,\nconveys a particular version and format of metaphysics. Among them,\nthe metaphysical section of the Book of Pointers and\nReminders has been singled out in scholarship because of the\nproliferation of independent commentaries on this work from the late\nXII until the early XVIII century by leading figures of Arabic-Islamic\nphilosophy like Fa\u1e2br al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 1209) and\nNa\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (d. 1274).\nScholars attribute the success of Avicenna\u2019s Pointers and\nReminders to doctrinal, stylistic, and chronological factors.\nDoctrinally, Avicenna\u2019s use of the essence-existence distinction\nto support the distinction between what is intrinsically necessary in\nsomething (like its essence) and what is extrinsically necessary in it\n(like its existence) was particularly obvious in the Pointers and\nReminders. Stylistically, the work\u2019s abbreviated and\nallusive style invites elaboration and commentary. Chronologically,\nthis was Avicenna\u2019s final comprehensive work and therefore could\nbe presented as the definitive expression of his views. For these\nreasons, the Pointers and Reminders are currently considered\nto be the work of Avicenna privileged by subsequent Muslim\nphilosophers (including the mutakallim\u016bn).\n\nThe Science of Divine Things also played an important role in\nspreading Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics among later advocates of this\ndiscipline. This is evident from its extensive manuscript tradition,\nthe vast exegetical activity devoted to The Cure/Healing, and\nthe frequent and widespread quotations of The Science of Divine\nThings among post-Avicennian authors. Transmitted by a huge\nnumber of manuscripts (more numerous and older than the ones of the\nPointers and Reminders currently known), The Science of\nDivine Thing and the other parts of the Cure/Healing\nwere copied uninterruptedly for nine centuries, from the end of V/XI\ncentury, a few decades after Avicenna\u2019s death, until the XIV/XX\ncentury. Its exegetical tradition is first attested in the form of\nmarginalia, which never circulated independently from manuscripts\nbefore the X/XVI c. The earliest extant \u201ccommentaries\u201d on\nthe text are in fact collections of marginal glosses of this kind,\nwhich gained independent circulation in self-standing book format at\nthe time of a new-born interest in The Cure/Healing, and of\nan apparent loss of interest in the Pointers and Reminders,\nwhose commentatorial activity starts decreasing then: the\nta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t of \u0120iy\u0101\u1e6f al-D\u012bn\nDa\u0161tak\u012b \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b and of\n\u1e62adr\u0101 al-D\u012bn (Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101)\nal-\u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b (d. 1640) are noteworthy instances of\nthis trend. Later lemmatic commentaries, like the one by\nMu\u1e25ammad Mahd\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e0earr al-Nar\u0101q\u012b\n(d. 1794/5), cover only parts of The Science of Divine\nThings, since the work in its entirety\u2014455 pages in the\ncurrent printing\u2014was too huge to be commented upon in this way,\nand no one has ever commented integrally on even one of the twenty-two\nbooks of The Cure/Healing, let alone the summa in\nits entirety. Finally, The Science of Divine Things is\nabundantly quoted by a wide array of scholars and writings, and even\nthe commentators on the Pointers and Reminders cite\nit\u2014as they do with The Cure/Healing in general\u2014as\nthe reference work to be consulted in case of theoretical\nuncertainties or for doctrinal integrations and developments.\n\nIn this context, the metaphysical sections of The Book of Science\nfor \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be-al-Dawla and of The Book of\nSalvation should also be taken into account. The former work\nobtained wide resonance since it was taken as model and incorporated\nby al-\u0120az\u0101l\u012b in his exposition of philosophy (The\nAims/Doctrines of the philosophers, Maq\u0101\u1e63id\nal-Fal\u0101sifa), a conduit for Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics in\nthe West as well. The latter work was copied in manuscripts at a very\nancient stage, and it was commented upon by important scholars like\n\u1e92\u0101hir al-Din Ibn Funduq al-Bayhaq\u012b (d.\n1169\u20131170) and Fa\u1e2br al-D\u012bn\nal-Isfar\u0101\u02bein\u012b al-N\u012bs\u0101b\u016br\u012b (fl.\nVI/XII c.).\n\nAt the present stage of research, we can tentatively conclude that no\nsingle work of Avicenna conveyed his metaphysical thought to later\ncenturies, although it is premature to assess how, when, and where\nthese different writings interacted and competed in transmitting\nAvicenna\u2019s view of metaphysics, and which of them enjoyed the\nstatus of Avicenna\u2019s most influential metaphysical work. Among\nthem, the manuscript diffusion, the commentatorial activity, and the\nconsideration and esteem of The Science of Divine Things\ndeserve special attention, since they cross the centuries and\nrepresent an uninterrupted trail of post-Avicennian philosophy, from\nAvicenna\u2019s first disciples until today. Such a continuity looks\nunattested in the case of the other metaphysical works by Avicenna. In\nthe continuum represented by the circulation of The Science of\nDivine Things, one may discern a peak: this is the Safavid era in\nIran (XVI-XVIII c.), which\u2014if we decide to call\n\u201cgolden\u201d the period 1100\u20131350\u2014can be labelled\nthe \u201cplatinum\u201d age of the reception of Avicenna\u2019s\nmetaphysics through The Science of Divine Things. But this\npeak has firm roots in previous centuries, especially in the\nkey-figure of Na\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b and\nhis school, and extends both backwards and forwards, according to a\ncomprehensive view of post-Avicennian falsafa.\n",
