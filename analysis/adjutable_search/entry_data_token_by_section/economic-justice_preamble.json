    "main_text": "\n\nDistributive justice is often considered not to belong to the scope of\neconomics, but there is actually an important literature in economics\nthat addresses normative issues in social and economic justice. A\nvariety of economic theories and approaches provide many insights in\nthese matters. Presented below are the theory of inequality and\npoverty measurement, welfare economics, the theory of social choice,\nthe theory of bargaining and of cooperative games, and the theory of\nfair allocation. There has been a good deal of cross-fertilization\nbetween these different branches of normative economics and\nphilosophical theories of justice, and many examples of such mutual\ninfluences are exhibited in this article.\n",
