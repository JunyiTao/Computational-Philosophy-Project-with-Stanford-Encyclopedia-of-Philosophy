    "main_text": "Jus in Bello || Proportionality\n4.4 Proportionality\n\nHolding the principle of Moral Distinction allows one to escape the\nrealist and pacifist horns of the responsibility dilemma, while still\ngiving responsibility its due. Even revisionists who deny moderate\nCombatant Equality could endorse Moral Distinction, and thereby\nretain the very plausible insight that it is worse to kill just\nnoncombatants than to kill just combatants. And, if they are to\naccount for most people\u2019s considered judgements about war, even\npacifists need some account of why killing civilians is worse than\nkilling soldiers.\n\nHowever, Moral Distinction is not Discrimination. It is a comparative\nclaim, and it says nothing about intentions. Discrimination, by\ncontrast, prohibits intentionally attacking noncombatants, except in\nsupreme emergencies. It is the counterpart of Proportionality, which\nplaces a much weaker bar on unintentionally killing noncombatants.\nOnly a terrible crisis could make it permissible to intentionally\nattack noncombatants. But the ordinary goods achieved in individual\nbattles can justify unintentional killing. What justifies this radical\ndistinction?\n\nThis is one of the oldest questions in normative ethics (though for\nthe recent debate, see Quinn 1989; Rickless 1997; McIntyre 2001;\nDelaney 2006; Thomson 2008; Tadros 2015). On most accounts, those who\nintend harm to their victims show them a more objectionable kind of disrespect\nthan those who unavoidably harm them as a side-effect. Perhaps the\nbest case for the significance of intentions is, first, in a general\nargument that mental states are relevant to objective permissibility\n(Christopher 1998; see also Tadros 2011). And second, we need a rich\nand unified theoretical account of the specific mental states that\nmatter in this way, into which intentions fit. It may be that the\nspecial prohibition of intentional attacks on civilians overstates the\nmoral truth. Intentions do matter. Other things equal, intentional\nkillings are worse than unintended killings (though some unintended\nkillings that are wholly negligent or indifferent to the victim are\nnearly as bad as intentional killings). But the difference between\nthem is not categorical. It cannot sustain the contrast between a\nnear-absolute prohibition on one hand, and a sweeping permission on\nthe other.\n\nOf course, this is precisely the kind of nuance that would be\ndisastrous if implemented in international law or if internalized as a\nnorm by combatants. Weighing lives in war is informationally\nincredibly demanding. Soldiers need a principle they can apply.\nDiscrimination is that principle. It is not merely a rule of\nthumb, since it entails something that is morally\ngrounded\u2014killing civilians is worse than killing soldiers. But\nit is also a rule of thumb, because it draws a starker\ncontrast between intended and unintended killing than is intrinsically\nmorally justified.\n\nAs already noted, proportionality and necessity contain within them\nalmost every other question in the ethics of war; we now consider two\nfurther points.\n\nFirst, proportionality in international law is markedly different from\nthe version of the principle that first-order moral theory supports.\nAt law, an act of war is proportionate insofar as the harm to\ncivilians is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct\nmilitary advantage realized thereby. As noted above, in first-order\nmoral terms, this is unintelligible. But there might be a better\ninstitutional argument for this neutral conception of proportionality.\nProportionality calculations involve many substantive value\njudgements\u2014for example, about the significance of moral status,\nintentions, risk, vulnerability, defencelessness, and so on. These are\nall highly controversial topics. Reasonable disagreement abounds. Many\nliberals think that coercive laws should be justified in terms that\nothers can reasonably accept, rather than depending on controversial\nelements of one\u2019s overarching moral theory (Rawls 1996: 217).\nThe law of armed conflict is coercive; violation constitutes a war\ncrime, for which one can be punished. Of course, a more complex law\nwould not be justiciable, but we also have principled grounds for not\nbasing international law on controversial contemporary disputes in\njust war theory. Perhaps the current standard can be endorsed from\nwithin a wider range of overarching moral theories than could anything\ncloser to the truth.\n\nSecond, setting aside the law and focusing again on morality, many\nthink that responsibility is crucial to thinking about\nproportionality, in the following way. Suppose the Free Syrian Army\n(FSA) launches an assault on Raqqa, stronghold of ISIL. They predict\nthat they will cause a number of civilian casualties in their assault,\nbut that this is only because ISIL has chosen to operate from within a\ncivilian area, forcing people to be \u201cinvoluntary human\nshields\u201d. Some think that ISIL\u2019s responsibility for\nputting those civilians at risk allows the FSA to give those\ncivilians\u2019 lives less weight in their deliberations than would\nbe appropriate if ISIL had not used them as human shields (Walzer\n2009; Keinon 2014).\n\nBut one could also consider the following: Even if ISIL is primarily\nat fault for using civilians as cover, why should this mean that those\ncivilians enjoy weaker protections against being harmed? We typically\nthink that one should only lose or forfeit one\u2019s rights through\none\u2019s own actions. But on this argument, civilians\nenjoy weaker protections against being killed through no fault or\nchoice of their own. Some might think that more permissive standards\napply for involuntary human shields because of the additional value of\ndeterring people from taking advantage of morality in this kind of way\n(Smilansky 2010; Keinon 2014). But that argument seems oddly circular:\nwe punish people for taking advantage of our moral restraint by not\nshowing moral restraint. What\u2019s more, this changes the act from\none that foreseeably kills civilians as an unavoidable side-effect of\ncountering the military threat to one that kills those civilians as a\nmeans to deter future abuses. This instrumentalizes them in a way that\nmakes harming them still harder to justify.\n",
