    "main_text": "Definitions || Who am I?\n2.2 Who am I?\n\nI am an object, such as the Earth, a cat, etc. \u201cI\u201d is\ndefined at a particular time by a complete (classical) description of\nthe state of my body and of my brain. \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cLev\u201d do not refer to the same things (even though my name\nis Lev). At the present moment there are many different\n\u201cLev\u201ds in different worlds (not more than one in each\nworld), but it is meaningless to say that now there is another\n\u201cI\u201d. I have a particular, well defined past: I correspond\nto a particular \u201cLev\u201d in 2020, but not to a particular\n\u201cLev\u201d in the future: I correspond to a multitude of\n\u201cLev\u201ds in 2030. This correspondence is seen in my memory\nof a unique past: a \u201cLev\u201d in 2021 shares memories with one\nparticular \u201cLev\u201d in 2020 but with multiple\n\u201cLev\u201ds in 2030. In the framework of the MWI it is\nmeaningless to ask: Which \u201cLev\u201d in 2030 will I be? I will\ncorrespond to them all. Every time I perform a quantum experiment\n(with several outcomes) it only seems to me that a single definite\nresult is obtained. Indeed, the \u201cLev\u201d who obtains this\nparticular result thinks this way. However, this \u201cLev\u201d\ncannot be identified as the only \u201cLev\u201d after the\nexperiment. The \u201cLev\u201d before the experiment corresponds to\nmultiple \u201cLev\u201ds who obtain all possible results.\n\nAlthough this approach to the concept of personal identity seems\nsomewhat unusual, it is plausible in the light of the critique of\npersonal identity by Parfit 1986. Parfit considers some artificial\nsituations in which a person splits into several copies, and argues\nthat there is no good answer to the question: \u201cWhich copy is\nme?\u201d He concludes that personal identity is not what matters\nwhen the observer divides. Saunders and Wallace 2008a argue that based\non the semantics of Lewis 1986 one can find a meaning for this\nquestion. However, in their reply (Saunders and Wallace 2008b) to\nTappenden 2008 they emphasise that their work is not about the nature\nof \u201cI\u201d, but about \u201cserviceability\u201d. Indeed, as\nit will be explained below, I should behave as if \u201cWhich copy is\nme?\u201d is a legitimate question.\n",
