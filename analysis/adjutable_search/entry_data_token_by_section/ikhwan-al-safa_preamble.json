    "main_text": "\n\nThe Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 or \u201cBrethren of\nPurity\u201d, as their name is commonly translated, are the authors\nof one of the most complete Medieval encyclopedias of sciences,\nantecedent at least two centuries to the best known in the Latin world\n(by Alexander Neckham, Thomas de Cantimpr\u00e9, Vincent de\nBeauvais, Bartholomaeus Anglicus, all dating back to the\n13th century). The \u201cencyclopedia\u201d is a\ncollection of Epistles, the Arabic title of which is\nRas\u00e2\u2019il Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 wa\nKhull\u00e2n al-Waf\u00e2\u2019 (Epistles of the Pure Brethren\nand the Sincere Friends). It consists of extremely heterogeneous\nmaterials, reworked to represent the whole educational training\nintended for an \u00e9lite (see later). It is very well\nknown, and a great deal of research into it has been done by Eastern\nand Western scholars, but the variety of topics addressed and the\nquestions raised as to the identity and ideology of its authors remain\nunsolved. In an isolated form, and under a false attribution, some of\nthese treatises came to the Latin Middle Ages through the Spanish\nversion by Maslama al-Majr\u00eet\u00ee, which is traditionally\nplaced at the beginnings of the 11th century. This already\ndiscussed chronology (Carusi 2000, 494\u2013500) is recently\nquestioned by several scholars. The development of research in this\ndirection was encouraged by the pioneer study, Fierro 1996, part. 94\nand 106\u2013108; cf. also Hamdani 1978, 350; Hamdani, Soufan 2019,\n11-12 (see infra).\n",
