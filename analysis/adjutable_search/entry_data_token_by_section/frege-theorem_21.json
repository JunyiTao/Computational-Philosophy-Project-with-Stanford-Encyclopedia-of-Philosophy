    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Analysis of Predecessor, Ancestrals, and the Natural Numbers || The Concept Natural Number\n4.4 The Concept Natural Number\n\nFrege\u2019s definition of natural number requires one more\npreliminary definition. Frege identified the number 0 as the number of\nthe concept being non-self-identical. That is: \n\n\\(0 \\eqdef \\#[\\lambda x \\, x\\neq x]\\) \n\nSince the logic of identity guarantees that no object is\nnon-self-identical, nothing falls under the concept being\nnon-self-identical. Had Frege\u2019s explicit definition of the\n\\(\\#F\\) worked as he had intended, the number 0 would, in effect, be\nidentified with the extension consisting of all those extensions of\nconcepts under which nothing falls. However, for the present purposes,\nwe may note that 0 is defined in terms of (a) the primitive notion\n\u2018the number of \\(F\\)s\u2019 and (b) a concept \\(([\\lambda x \\,\nx\\neq x])\\) whose existence is guaranteed by our second-order logic\nwith identity and comprehension. It is straightforward to prove the\nfollowing Lemma Concerning Zero from this definition of 0: \n\nLemma Concerning Zero:\n\n\\(\\#F\\eqclose 0 \\equivwide \\neg\\exists xFx\\) \n\n (Proof of Lemma Concerning Zero)\n\nNote that the proof appeals to Hume\u2019s Principle and facts about\nequinumerosity.\n\nFrege\u2019s definition of the concept natural number can\nnow be stated in terms of the weak-ancestral of Predecessor:\n\nx is a natural number if and only if \\(x\\) is a member of the\npredecessor-series beginning with 0 \n\nThis definition appears in Gl, \u00a783, and\nGg I, \u00a746 as the definition of \u2018finite\nnumber\u2019. Indeed, the natural numbers are precisely the finite\ncardinals. In formal terms, Frege\u2019s definition becomes: \n\n\\(Nx ~ \\eqdef ~ \\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x)\\) \n\nIn what follows, we shall sometimes use the variables \\(m\\), \\(n\\),\nand \\(o\\) to range over the natural numbers. In other words,\nwe\u2019ll use formulas of the form \\(\\forall n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\) to\nabbreviate formulas of the form \\(\\forall x(Nx \\to \\ldots x\\ldots)\\),\nand use formulas of the form \\(\\exists n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\) to\nabbreviate formulas of the form \\(\\exists x(Nx \\amp \\ldots\nx\\ldots)\\).\n",
