This is not wrong, but\ncan be misleading if overemphasized. At the same time as it summarizes\nthe earlier work, \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d\nevinces a transition to Horkheimer\u2019s later critiques of reason\nand enlightenment (a similar point is made in Benhabib 1986, pp.\n149\u2013163). The most obvious change occurs in the name Horkheimer\ngives to his favored view, as he shifts from \u201cmaterialism\u201d\nto \u201ccritical theory.\u201d But the changes are more than\ncosmetic. For example, the critique of \u201ctraditional\ntheory\u201d subtly shifts the terms of the critiques of metaphysics\nand positivism. Also, the role of the theorist vis-a-vis society\nchanges. In part, this prefigures later views.\n\nThe titular forms of theorizing correspond (as noted at the beginning\nof the 1937 \u201cPostscript,\u201d p. 244) to those found in\nDescartes\u2019 Discourse on Method and Marx\u2019s\ncritique of political economy, respectively. So the overarching point\nof the essay can be summarized fairly succinctly; it describes a form\nof \u201ctraditional\u201d theory that follows Descartes\u2019\nmethodology, examines the weaknesses of such theory, and then opposes\nto traditional theory a superior Marxian \u201ccritical\u201d\ntheory. The critique of traditional theory largely follows the earlier\ncritique of the sciences and positivism, and in this sense is a\nsummation. Again, the fact that the sciences do not recognize their\npresence in a broader social framework is emphasized. Traditional\ntheory misses the fact that that \u201cbringing hypotheses to bear on\nfacts is an activity that goes on, ultimately, not in the\nsavant\u2019s head but in industry\u201d (p. 196).\n\u201cSavant\u201d is the derisive term Horkheimer uses throughout\nthe text to refer to the traditional theorist, and the savant does not\nrecognize that the economic (and thus currently capitalist) structure\nof society shapes scientific work. The savant further misses the\nsuffering caused by that social structure, and the fact that science\nis complicit in this oppression. Critical theorizing, on the other\nhand, is \u201ca human activity which has society itself for its\nobject\u201d (p. 206); it overcomes the blindness of the savant by\nopenly and purposely examining the way in which theory is immersed in\na particular historical and social setting, and it seeks to critique\nthat social setting for emancipatory effect. This relies on a form of\nimmanent critique, tied to the suffering of the oppressed; the\ntheorist must seize on the meaning of the experience of the oppressed\nand develop it into a coherent critique of existing society. To this\nend Horkheimer notes that if the critical theorist\u2019s\n\u201cpresentation of societal contradictions is not merely an\nexpression of the concrete historical situation but also a force\nwithin it to stimulate change, then [the critical theorist\u2019s]\nreal function emerges\u201d (p. 215).\n\nThis general symmetry with the earlier program belies certain\nimportant changes to the theory, however. The very beginning of the\ntext, which discusses traditional theory, shows a subtle shift from\nthe earlier work. Traditional theory is first linked with the natural\nsciences, for which \u201ctheory\u201d involves a set of logically\nlinked propositions that are consonant with empirical facts. The\nlogical coherence of such a set of propositions is then emphasized,\nand connected to Descartes\u2019 method. Horkheimer goes on to\nsuggest that such a conception of theory has an inherent tendency to\nmove toward \u201ca purely mathematical system of symbols.\u201d\nFormal logic and reasoning thus become a main target of criticism.\nThis is not a radical departure from Horkheimer\u2019s earlier\ncritique of science, since, for example, in \u201cNotes on Science\nand the Crisis,\u201d he objects to the rigid, mechanistic character\nof the scientific method. But the earlier texts focus more on a\nproblem that is external to the sciences. There is no coherent\n\u201csetting of tasks\u201d prior to the engagement in empirical\nresearch, and the results of empirical research are not knit into a\nbroader theory that can have emancipatory intent. The earlier essays\nlargely ask for the sciences to go about their normal business within\nan interdisciplinary setting that would correct these problems. In\n\u201cTraditional and Critical Theory,\u201d on the other hand, the\ncritique strikes more directly at the formalism inherent in the\nsciences\u2019 own methodology, such that the problem is internal to\nthe sciences. This provides one clear transitional point, insofar as\nformalism will be a primary object of critique in Horkheimer\u2019s\nwritings from the 1940s.\n\nAnother interesting shift is that the critique of metaphysics largely\nfalls out of the picture. For some commentators, metaphysics is\nfolded, along with science, into traditional theory (see Brunkhorst\n1993, 74). But this does not seem entirely correct, because in the\nmidst of criticizing positivism, Horkheimer notes that there is,\n\u201clurking\u201d in positivism\u2019s emphasis on facts,\n\u201csomething like a reaction against the alliance of metaphysics\nand oppression\u201d (p. 232). This claim harkens back to the\nnotion, described in places like \u201cMaterialism and\nMetaphysics,\u201d that scientific attention to facts, when properly\nconstrued within materialist research, can keep philosophy from\noverlooking actual human suffering. But such references are few, and\nHorkheimer does shift the discussion of science in such a way that it\ntakes over parts of his earlier critique of metaphysics. For example,\nhe criticizes the sciences, in a manner that is not common in earlier\nessays, for the way they subsume facts under universal concepts (pp.\n224\u2013226). This critique of universal concepts is tied to the\ncritique of formalism; Horkheimer finds fault in the fact that the\nsciences relate facts to concepts in terms of the \u201crelation of\nclasses to instances\u201d which can be \u201caccomplished by a\nsimple deduction\u201d (p.225). Critical theory is then contrasted\nwith this overly simplified universal-particular relation insofar as\nit constantly reexamines the relation of facts to universal concepts,\nand sees them as fitting together in a dynamic relationship that must\nbe carefully charted. The implication is that logical formalism leads\nthe sciences to form static universals into which all particulars can\nbe neatly placed. Since the sciences are attending to facts in\nengaging in such an operation, the critique does not exactly match up\nwith the criticism that metaphysics turns a blind eye to the world.\nBut as those facts are misconstrued through formalism, the upshot of\nthe critique is the same; actual social existence has not been\nadequately incorporated into theory because of the creation of a false\nuniversal. This formalism is contrasted with the fact that critical\ntheory is \u201cthe unfolding of a single existential judgment\u201d\n(p. 227). Displaying the contradictions inherent in capitalist\nsociety, and fixing on possibilities for emancipatory change, does not\ninvolve the scientific subsumption of facts within a logically ordered\nconceptual system. It rather involves unfolding and elaborating on an\ninsight that one initially acquires simply by existing in (with\n\u201cexisting in\u201d taken in the robust sense of living and\nacting in) that society.\n\nThe way this point is construed displays the most crucial difference\nbetween \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d and its\nantecedents. Horkheimer\u2019s attitude toward the possibility of\nsocial change is less optimistic, and the critical theorist is\ndescribed as having a somewhat antagonistic relationship with the\noppressed. This fits with a general shift in the Frankfurt\nSchool\u2019s work from the 1930s to the 1940s corresponding to a\nlack of faith in the possibility of emancipatory social change. In his\n1937 essay \u201cPhilosophy and Critical Theory,\u201d (which he\nwrote largely as a response to and counterpart with \u201cTraditional\nand Critical Theory\u201d) Herbert Marcuse rhetorically asks what\nhappens \u201cif the development outlined by the theory does not\noccur? What if the forces that were to bring about the transformation\nare suppressed and appear to be defeated?\u201d (Marcuse 1937, 63)\n\u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d is worried precisely\nwith these questions. For a variety of reasons, including obvious\nsocial and political exigencies, Horkheimer and his associates would\nbecome less and less confident that the oppressed classes could become\na force for change. Horkheimer clearly did not believe that compassion\nand the desire to overcome suffering could, on their own, motivate\nsocial change. Consider the assertion in \u201cTraditional and\nCritical Theory\u201d that while the oppressed strive for happiness\nthey do not know how to achieve it, so the theorist must step in and\nhelp the oppressed come to critical consciousness. \u201cEven the\nsituation of the proletariat is\u2026no guarantee of correct\nknowledge\u201d (pp. 211\u2013215); the significance of suffering is\nnot always evident to those who experience it, and it is the job of\nthe social theorist to elaborate on this significance in such a way\nthat it can have practical effect. \u201cTraditional and Critical\nTheory\u201d holds out the hope that this task is possible, but it is\nnoteworthy that the critical theorist is described as being set over\nagainst the oppressed, as \u201cit is the task of the critical\ntheoretician to reduce the tension between his own insight and\noppressed humanity in whose service he thinks\u201d (p. 221).\n\nHorkheimer would become less and less confident that the tension could\nbe so reduced. He also ominously notes that while the \u201ccommodity\neconomy\u201d might at first usher in a period of progress,\n\u201cafter an enormous extension of human control over nature, it\nfinally hinders further development and drives humanity into a new\nbarbarism\u201d (p. 227). This passage states the main themes that\nwould dominate Horkheimer\u2019s work in the 1940s, which would be\nmarked by an increasing pessimism in the ability of rational,\ntheoretical activity to halt that drive toward barbarism.\n",
