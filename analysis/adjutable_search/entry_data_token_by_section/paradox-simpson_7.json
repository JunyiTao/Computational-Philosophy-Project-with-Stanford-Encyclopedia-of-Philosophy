    "main_text": "Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Causal Inference || DAGs and Causal Identifiability\n3.3 DAGs and Causal Identifiability\n\nIn recent years, the formal analysis of causation has been\nsignificantly enhanced by the development of graphical methods for\nrepresenting causal hypotheses and for choosing among candidate\nhypotheses given one\u2019s evidence, in particular those using directed\nacyclic graphs (=DAGs: Pearl 1988, 2000 [2009]; Spirtes et\nal. 2000). A DAG contains a set of nodes connected by a set of\ndirected edges or arrows such that there are no cycles (one cannot get\nfrom a node back to itself via a set of directed arrows). In the\ncausal context, the nodes in a DAG are random variables and the arrows\ncorrespond to direct causal relationships. It is common to assume that\nthe set of variables in a DAG is causally sufficient, meaning\nthat it includes all common causes of variables in the set.\n\nDAGs enable one to systematically map the relationship between causal\nhypotheses and joint probability distributions. They overlap with and\nbuild on techniques in the literature on probabilistic causality, but\nprovide significantly stronger tools and results. See the entries on\n causal models,\n causation and manipulability and\n counterfactual theories of causation\n for detailed introductions to causal inference with DAGs.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The relationship between the\nvariables Treatment, Gender, and Success\nrepresented in a DAG, without and with an intervention on\nTreatment.\n\n\nFigure 2\n (left part) presents a plausible DAG for our running example,\nincluding the variables Treatment, Gender, and\nSuccess. There are two ways in which Treatment\nprovides information about Success. One is that people who\ntake the treatment may be more (or less) likely to recover as a result\nof having taken it. The other is that learning that someone took the\ntreatment provides information about whether they are likely to be\nmale or female, and this information is relevant to determining\nwhether they will recover regardless of whether they took the\ntreatment.\n\nThe graphs can, however, also be interpreted causally, and here, the\nnotion of an ideal intervention is crucial:\n\n\nFor an intervention on a variable \\(V\\) to be ideal\nis for it to determine \\(V\\)\u2019s value such that it no longer\ndepends on its other causes in the DAG. Graphically, we can represent\nan intervention by adding an additional cause I that\n\u201cbreaks\u201d all of the arrows that would otherwise go into\n\\(V\\).\nSo, in Figure 2\nIntervention is an ideal intervention on Treatment.\nIntervening on Treatment disrupts the evidential relationship\nwith Gender\u2014for example, by controlling for the\nproportion of male and female patients in each sample\u2014so that\nany remaining probabilistic relationship between treatment and\nrecovery can only be explained by having taken the treatment. Such an\nexperimental design, where Treatment and Gender are\nmade probabilistically independent, suffices to rule out association\nreversal (cf.\n Section 2.2).\n\nUsing the notion of an ideal intervention, one can explicate causation\nas follows (Pearl 2000 [2009]; Woodward 2003). \\(C\\) causes \\(E\\) if\nand only if it is possible to change the value or probability of \\(E\\)\nvia some ideal intervention on \\(C\\). Such interventions distinguish\nbetween causal and merely probabilistic dependencies by eliminating\nany probabilistic relationship between \\(C\\) or \\(E\\) that can be\ntraced to the influence of a common cause. This does not mean,\nhowever, that one can only get causal knowledge in cases where one can\nexperimentally intervene. One of the key contributions of graphical\ncausal models is that they enable one to systematically determine when\none\u2019s prior causal knowledge licenses one to interpret a\nparticular probabilistic relationship causally.\n\nThe difference between the probability distributions resulting from\nconditioning and from intervening is formally represented by\nsupplementing the probability calculus with the\ndo-operator (\\(\\do(X)\\)) where\napplying the operator to a variable formally represents intervening\nupon it. Taking \\(T\\), \\(S\\), and \\(M\\) to denote\nTreatment, Success, and Gender, and given\nthe graph in\n Figure 2,\n \nthe observational probability distribution of \\(S\\) given \\(T\\) is not equal to\nthe probability distribution of \\(S\\) given an intervention on \\(T\\):  \n\n\\[\\tag{3}\\label{int}\np(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T})  \\ne  p(\\r{S}\\mid \\do(\\r{T}))\\]\n\n\nThe difference between these two quantities is due to the impact of\n\\(M\\) on the distribution of \\(T\\). In contrast, the following two\nexpressions are equivalent given the DAG: \n\n\\[\\tag{4}\\label{cond}\np(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T},\\r{M}) = p(\\r{S}\\mid \\do(\\r{T}),\\r{M})\\]\n\n\nHere one can infer the effect of \\(T\\) on \\(S\\) from the observational\ndistribution by conditioning on \\(M\\). In such a case, we say that\n (4) \nidentifies the causal effect of \\(T\\) on \\(S\\). More\ngenerally, identifiability is a relationship between\na DAG G, probability distribution \\(P\\) and a causal quantity\n\\(\\r{Q}\\), such that \\(\\r{Q}\\) is identifiable if and only if it is\nuniquely determined by \\(P\\) given \\(G\\). By contrast, when there are\nunmeasured common cause(s) of \\(S\\) and \\(T\\), the probability\ndistribution is compatible with any possible distribution for\n\\(p(\\r{S}\\mid \\do (\\r{T}))\\).\n",
