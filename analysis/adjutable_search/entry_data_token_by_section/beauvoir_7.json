Indeed, what interests Beauvoir about\nSade is that \u201c[he] posed the problem of the other in\nits extremest terms\u201d (1963[1965], 243, cf. 1963, 333). \n\n\u201cMust we Burn Sade?\u201d identifies Sade\u2019s decision to\nwrite as an existential project. Beauvoir credits Sade with uncovering\nthe despotic secrets of the patriarchal political machine. She is\nsympathetic to his utopian appeal to freedom. She finds, however, that\nSade perverted the meaning of freedom. Thus, Beauvoir identifies Sade\nas a great moralist who endorsed an unsatisfactory ethics.\n\nSade is Beauvoir\u2019s Janus-faced ally. She does not refute his\nclaim that cruelty establishes a relationship between the self and the\nother. Sade is correct. Cruelty reveals us to each other in the\nparticularities and ambiguities of our conscious and fleshed\nexistence. The tyrant and victim, Beauvoir tells us, are a genuine\ncouple. They are united by the bonds of the flesh and freedom.\n\nFor Beauvoir, Sade is the epitome of maniacal passion dedicated to the\nproject of cruelty. Because he takes full responsibility for his\nchoices, he must be credited with choosing freedom and accepted as\nbeing authentic. This does not, however, make him either an ethical or\nmoral figure for his choices destroy the intersubjective bonds of\nhumanity. His account of the power of cruelty provides a convincing\ncritique of our social, political and personal hypocrisies, but it\ndoes not critique the ways that cruelty is a perversion of freedom and\nan exploitation of the vulnerability of the flesh. As a result, his\ndescriptions of the powers of cruelty and the meaning of torture are\nincomplete and inadequate. The case of the Marquis de Sade makes it\nclear that assuming responsibility for one\u2019s choices, is a\nnecessary, but not sufficient, condition of an existential ethics of\nfreedom.\n\nIn the end, Beauvoir finds that Sade was misled (which does not mean\nthat he was innocent). He mistook power for freedom and misunderstood\nthe meanings of the erotic. In his fascination with the conflict\nbetween consciousness and the flesh, Sade exposed the failure of the\nsadistic enterprise. In his attempt to lose himself in the pleasures\nof the flesh, and so to experience both the ambiguity of his being as\nconsciousness made flesh (or flesh made consciousness) and the reality\nof his being for and with others, Sade substitutes the spectacle for\nlived experience and accepts counterfeit transactions of domination\nand assimilation/incorporation as genuine relationships of reciprocity\nand gratuitous generosity. In doing so, he never reaches the\nother.\n\nCentering his life in the erotic, Sade missed the truth of the erotic.\nThis truth, Beauvoir tells us, can only be found by those who abandon\nthemselves to the risks of emotional intoxication. Living this\nintoxication we discover the ways that the body turned flesh dissolves\nall arguments against the immediacy of our bonds with each other and\ngrounds an ethic of the appeal, risk and mutual vulnerability.\n\nUltimately, in this essay Beauvoir leaves behind the idea that our\nfreedom, as absolutely internal, is immune from an assault by the\nother, and accepts the radical vulnerability of our lived embodiment.\nIn doing so, the questions of violence and desire cannot be severed\nfrom the question of our shared humanity or questions of ethics and\njustice. In condemning Sade for his perversion of the erotic, Beauvoir\nalso faults him as an artist, which marks a return to the question of\nthe responsibility of the artist raised in The Ethics of\nAmbiguity. Though she accuses him of being a technically poor\nwriter, the heart of her criticism is ethical not aesthetic. According\nto Beauvoir, Sade violated his obligations as an author. Instead of\nrevealing the world to us in its promise and possibilities, and\ninstead of appealing to us to work for justice, he took refuge in the\nimaginary and developed metaphysical justifications for suffering and\ncruelty. In the end, Beauvoir accuses Sade of being the serious man\ndescribed in The Ethics of Ambiguity.\n9. The Long March: Time, Politics, and Possibility\n\nIn 1957 Beauvoir published The Long March, an essay about her\nsix-week visit to China in September and October of 1955. Although a\ntravelogue in many respects, The Long March does not take on\nthe memoir style form of America Day by Day. She undertook\ninterdisciplinary research to inform her descriptions of her visit,\nand like The Second Sex and The Coming of Age,\nBeauvoir mines various sources for ways to engage the observations of\nher trip. She narrates lengthy descriptions of what she saw and\ncritically considers facts and myths of the time. Similar to\nAmerica Day by Day, there are standout themes that exemplify\nBeauvoir\u2019s philosophical and political concerns: labor\nstruggles, the gendered politics of the family, political economy, and\nthe relation between customs, law, and freedom. Beauvoir\u2019s\nmaterialist understanding of struggle and revolution underlies these\nconcerns. For these reasons, this travel writing is also a political\nwriting. Notably, American anti-Communists were outraged when the book\nwas translated into English in 1958.\n\nThe book is at once a response to right-wing French views on China,\nand hence a further criticism of her ongoing disdain for French\nbourgeois ideals, and a consideration of the promise of communist\nChina. While her optimism about communist China is worthy of\ncriticism, Beauvoir\u2019s optimism was not totalizing. She was aware\nand bothered by her curated visit and she expressed her own doubts and\nuncertainties about the reality she encountered. But still, she makes\nno final judgment about China, refusing to have the book serve as a\nmouthpiece for French anticommunist sentiments. Beauvoir was\ninterested in alternatives to bourgeois capitalism and so she engaged\nthe possibilities of communist China. She attended to the formation of\nmeaning as it broke with the past to create a new future, an\nengagement with historical time that is necessary for all political\nprojects. Her descriptions also tend to her perception of the cultural\ndifferences between China and France, yet the outcome can be\ndisappointing. She describes some encounters with Chinese culture and\ntraditions in dismissive ways, which challenges the possibility of\ncross-cultural solidarity.\n\nBeauvoir was deeply unsatisfied with and embarrassed by the book. She\nadmitted it was outdated within years of its publication and believed\nit to be lacking in philosophical rigor. There are also inaccuracies\nand questionable representations in her account. Among scholars, it is\nup for debate whether her intellectual curiosity and Western privilege\nto tour China are part of an orientalizing gaze at work in the text.\nIn spite of, or perhaps even because of, these complicated dimensions\nand the book\u2019s limits, The Long March is another\ninteresting example of Beauvoir\u2019s political voice and exposes\nthe complexities of the appeal. It also invites us to engage the\nlimits of a particular appeal.\n10. Djamila Boupacha: The Concrete Appeal\n\nIn 1962, Beauvoir and Gisile Halimi co-authored the story of Djamila\nBoupacha, an Algerian girl accused of being a terrorist who was\ntortured by the French during the French-Algerian War. This book may\nbe read as an extension of Beauvoir\u2019s critique of the Marquis de\nSade. Instead of fleeing from the horrors of the real into the safety\nof the imaginary, Beauvoir takes up her responsibility as an author to\nexpose and confront realities that the state would rather hide. Her\npurpose in writing is concrete and political. The book is both a\nprotest and an appeal. Countering Sade, Beauvoir and Halimi show that\nthe truth of torture lies in the unjustifiable politics of abusive\npower.\n11. All Men are Mortal, A Very Easy Death, Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre: Finitude, Passion and the Body\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s phenomenological understanding of the lived body can\nalso be tracked in her considerations of the question of human\nfinitude. This question is raised early in her 1946 novel, All Men\nAre Mortal, which is a story of Fosca, a man who chooses to cheat\ndeath. His desire for immortality is driven by his desire to realize\nthe abstract ideal of humanism. Fosca does not embrace immortality to\nescape the ambiguities of the flesh and embodiment. His decision is\nmotivated by his desire to save the world. He believes that time is\nhis enemy, so long as his time is limited. He believes that with\nsufficient time he can bring the humanist project to closure and\nsecure it from failure.\n\nContrary to his initial belief, Fosca learns that time becomes his\nenemy when it stretches endlessly before him. It turns out that time\nis not what he needs to secure his vision. Rather, what he needs is\nthe commitment of others. No amount of time can secure that. As\nimmortal, Fosca confronts the inevitability of failure that haunts\nhumanity. Unlike mortals, however, who, confronted with the\nconstraints of time, take up their failures with passion, Fosca\nbecomes immobilized. Indifference to life replaces the passion for\nlife. In the end, he discovers the crucial truth of ethical action\nfrom his many-generations-removed grandson, Armand. Understanding that\nthe future belongs to others who may or may not take up his projects,\nArmand commits himself to the concrete possibilities of the present.\nHis passion is embodied in the appeal to others, not in an abstract\ngoal that, however just it might seem, would deny future generations\nthe right to determine their own destiny.\n\nIn All Men Are Mortal the givenness of finitude and death\nconcerns our relationship to time. Eighteen years later, writing about\nthe dying and death of her mother in A Very Easy Death\n(1964), and six years after that, analyzing the situation of the aged\nin The Coming of Age (1970), and eleven years subsequent to\nthat, chronicling Sartre\u2019s last days in Adieux: A Farewell\nto Sartre (1981), it is not so much our relationship to time but\nmore a matter of our embodiment that concerns Beauvoir. In A Very\nEasy Death and Adieux, Beauvoir assumes the position of\nthe phenomenological witness. The bodies of her mother and Sartre are\ngiven to us in all their disturbing breakdowns and deteriorations.\nSome have found these works cold, insensitive and even cruel. They\nmiss Beauvoir\u2019s point. She is showing us who we are. The\n\u201cI can\u201d body revealed by other phenomenologists as a\ncrucial mark of embodiment is the limited condition of the mature\nhealthy body. It is but one phase of the life of the body. In its\nearly days the body is still learning its \u201cI can\u2019s\u201d.\nAs we age, the body begins losing them. It is one thing, as with the\nmyth of Woman, to alienate an \u201cI can\u201d from its capacities.\nIt is quite another to refuse to attend to the full range of embodied\nlife and to assess the value of that life in terms of its \u201cI\ncan\u201d possibilities.\n12. The Coming of Age: The Other Again\n\nWe need to read A Very Easy Death and Adieux within\nthe context of the analyses of The Coming of Age to fully\nappreciate Beauvoir\u2019s role as witness. The project of The\nComing of Age is similar to that of The Second Sex. Like\nThe Second Sex, it focuses on a group of people designated as\nOther; like The Second Sex it exposes the mythical status of\nthe \u201cfacts\u201d about aging and the aged; and like The\nSecond Sex it indicts society for its dehumanization of those it\ndesignates as Other. The Coming of Age also emulates The\nSecond Sex in its method and scope. It brings a phenomenological\nlens to bear on biological, psychological, historical, economic, and\nsociological factors in order to understand the phenomenon of a\nparticular kind of marginalized otherness. \n\nIn The Coming of Age, Beauvoir considers the injustices\nendured by the aged. She describes the experiences of old age and\nargues that it throws one into the position of the Other not by\nnecessity, but as a result of culturally produced stigmas and a\nsocietal loathing of aging. Thus, while the process of aging may be\ninescapable, old age as a situation of Otherness is not. This\nnon-subject status is a matter of the conditions of experience that\nforeclose transcendence, including myths, societal attitudes, and the\neconomic conditions of the aged. Whereas in The Second Sex,\nBeauvoir accused patriarchy of depriving women of their subject\nstatus, The Coming of Age argues that the non-subject status\nof the aged can be traced to the fact that they are barred from\nexistential projects and meaningful relationships with others. To\nexperience old age in this way, Beauvoir argues, is to be denied\none\u2019s humanity. \u201cThe old man\u201d, Beauvoir writes,\n\u201clooks to active members of the community like one of a\n\u2018different species\u2019\u201d because he is not engaged in a\nproject (1970[1972], 231, cf. 1972, 217).\n\nLike The Second Sex, which attended to the givens of biology\nwithout allowing them to determine the meaning of the subject, The\nComing of Age also gives biology its due. The lack of engagement\nof the aged, Beauvoir notes, is in part imposed from without and in\npart comes from within; for as we age, the body is transformed from an\ninstrument that engages the world into a hindrance that makes our\naccess to the world difficult. The point of The Coming of\nAge, however, is that it is unjust to use these difficulties to\njustify reducing the aged to the status of the Other.\nAdieux\u2019s witnessing makes this point clearly. However\ndiminished Sartre\u2019s body became, it never severed him from his\nprojects. He could not have sustained his work by himself, however.\nRather, he was in a situation where others refused to marginalize him.\nThey did not equate his diminished bodily capacities with a diminished\nhumanity. The Coming of Age argues that the situation of a\nprivileged Sartre ought to be our common destiny.\n\nIn a world that recognized the phenomenological truth of the body, the\nexistential truth of freedom, the Marxist truth of exploitation and\nthe human truth of the bond, the derogatory category of the Other\nwould be eradicated. Neither the aged nor women, nor anyone by virtue\nof their race, class, ethnicity or religion would find themselves\nrendered inessential. Beauvoir knows that it is too much to hope for\nsuch a world. She understands the lures of domination and violence.\nThroughout her career, however, she used philosophical and literary\ntools to reveal the possibilities of such a world and appealed to us\nto work for it.\n13. Life Writings: Situation, Becoming and the Self-Other Relation\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s practices of writing the self were deeply connected\nto her philosophical ideas. Indeed, for Beauvoir, living is\nphilosophy, a point that is evident in her autobiographical works.\nBeauvoir wrote a four-volume autobiography where she recounts\nfifty-four years of her life, from the years 1908\u20131962. In\nMemoirs of a Dutiful Daughter (1958), Beauvoir narrates the\nformative years of 1908\u20131929, while The Prime of Life\ncovers 1929\u20131944. Force of Circumstance (1963) is\nwritten in two volumes, 1944\u20131952 (After the War) and\n1952\u20131962 (Hard Times). Beauvoir was also a devoted\ndiarist. Her diaries, including Diary of a Philosophy Student\nVolume 1 (1926\u201327) and Volume 2 (1928\u201329),\nand her Wartime Diaries, often complicate the narration of\nher autobiographies, exposing different details of her life and thus\nexpose a different Beauvoir to the reader. For Beauvoir, diary writing\nwas an integral part of self-understanding and self-making. The\nsignificance of these autobiographical works is threefold. They offer\na detailed account of events, experiences and relations with others\nout of which Beauvoir made her self, that is, these works reveal how\nshe became Beauvoir. They also shed light on Beauvoir\u2019s\nphilosophical trajectory, intellectual influences, the ideas and\nthemes central to her novels and philosophical works, and they offer\nglaring evidence that her philosophical ideas developed prior to,\nalongside, and often against Sartre\u2019s.\n\nIn writing her life, it is evident that the notion of situation, the\nset of concrete circumstances, including one\u2019s embodiment that\nsignificantly shapes but does not fix one\u2019s existence, is\ncentral to Beauvoir\u2019s philosophy of self. It is only in living\nand living out one\u2019s choices, constrained but not determined by\nsocial and historical context, that one\u2019s existence takes shape.\nBeauvoir\u2019s autobiographical writings make clear that her\nsituation as a girl raised in a Catholic, bourgeois household, as a\nwoman with a certain level of independence and privilege, an\nintellectual, a writer, a leftist living amidst and in the aftermath\nof war and colonial projects, are all generative circumstances for\nher. She is neither the mere product of circumstance nor does she just\nwill herself into existence. Yet, her understanding of\n\u2018situation\u2019 takes time to develop, as Beauvoir herself\nnotes that she did not always recognize the force of circumstance.\nThough, perhaps that she did not recognize this to be the case was a\nconstraint of her own particular situation. In The Prime of\nLife, for instance, the Beauvoir we read about is still full of\nbourgeois idealism and is focused on happiness, which she marks as\ncharacteristic of the times. Ultimately, in narrating her experience,\nBeauvoir discloses the connection between the personal and the\ncollective, and the distinctness of a self unfolding in time.\n\nThe ethical significance Beauvoir places on the self-other relation is\nalso central to her autobiographical writings. Although it is not\nuntil 1939 that she rejects individualism, Beauvoir\u2019s younger\nyears show a deep interest in her relationships with others. Her\nrelationship with her parents and her love for Zaza and her cousin\nJacques, for instance, reveal the capacity of others to open and close\nthe world and to make and remake the self. Indeed, there is a robust\nphilosophy of love across Beauvoir\u2019s personal writings,\nincluding her love with Zaza (fictionalized in Inseparable),\nto the complicated relationship with Sartre, to her longing for Nelson\nAlgren (detailed further in A Transatlantic Love Affair, her\npublished letters to Algren), to her discussion of She Came to\nStay and the narration of the triad with Olga in The Prime of\nLife, that speak not only to Beauvoir\u2019s preoccupations with\nthe role of love in life more generally, but to the bond between self\nand other that takes shape in an erotic encounter. In Force of\nCircumstance, Beauvoir considers the self-other relation in more\npolitical terms as she describes the politicization of her private\nexistence and the Algerian War and colonial oppression.\nBeauvoir\u2019s attention to the Algerian War was an encounter that\nplaced an ethical demand on her, out of which she politicized and so\nreshaped her self.\n\nFor Beauvoir, the writing of her life, including writing about her\ndesire to write, is ultimately a way to disclose the ambiguities of\nconcrete existence. The detail at which Beauvoir narrates her life,\nincluding the omissions she makes, which are exposed in her diaries,\noffers important insights about Beauvoir\u2019s philosophical ideas\nand their emergence within and out of her experience. These writings\nare also philosophically significant investigations of the meaning of\nexistence and an ethics, one that is not laid out programmatically but\nthat is disclosed in the joys, banality, and failures of living.\n14. Influence and Current Scholarship\n\nBeauvoir is no doubt a feminist icon and one of the most impactful\nfeminist thinkers of the twentieth century. The Second Sex,\ntranslated in 40 languages, has inspired generations of women to\nchallenge their status and pursue freedom. In spite of her impact,\nreadings and receptions of Beauvoir among feminist scholars were\ninitially largely antagonistic. The renaissance in Beauvoir\nscholarship served as a response. While difficult to pin down its\nexact beginning, it was after Beauvoir\u2019s death in 1986 that\ndifferent questions about and inquiries into her thinking became more\nprevalent. The Second Sex has also been the source of\nimportant debate and criticism in the interdisciplinary field of\nfeminist theory, and even among those who distance themselves from her\nwork, it has been no less impactful. For instance, Beauvoir\u2019s\nlegacy is apparent in the work of more contemporary thinkers like Sara\nAhmed, Judith Butler, bell hooks, and Luce Irigaray.\n\nA significant aspect of the renewal in Beauvoir scholarship has much\nto do with the posthumous availability of previously unpublished\npersonal writings, the increasing number of works translated into\nEnglish, especially those in the Beauvoir Series published by\nUniversity of Illinois Press, and the 2010 new English translation of\nThe Second Sex. Access to such work, made possible by the\nlabor of Beauvoir scholars, has helped shed light on Beauvoir\u2019s\nphilosophical influences and her own criticisms of and distance from\nSartre. That access has also challenged misinterpretations stemming\nfrom inadequate translations and has encouraged interest in and more\nthorough engagement with Beauvoir\u2019s work beyond The Second\nSex. The interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed journal, Simone de\nBeauvoir Studies, founded in 1983 and reorganized in 2016, and\nthe International Simone de Beauvoir Society, are important venues for\nthe study of Beauvoir\u2019s life and works.\n\nGiven the scope of Beauvoir\u2019s influence internationally and\ninterdisciplinarily, it is difficult to succinctly capture her legacy.\nThe following highlights a few key areas scholarship: Beauvoir\u2019s\noriginal philosophical contributions to existentialism (e.g., Le\nDoeuff 1980; Butler 1986; Kruks 1990 and 2001; Fullbrook and Fullbrook\n1994; Gothlin 1999; Arp 2001; Kail 2006; Deutscher 2008; Daigle and\nColomb 2009) and phenomenology (Bergoffen 1997; Hein\u00e4maa 1997 and\n2003; Oksala 2016 and 2022; Mann 2018); her contributions to ethics\n(e.g., Gothlin 1995; Tidd 1999a and 1999b; Stoller 2014) and political\ntheory (e.g., Kruks 2012;); situating The Second Sex\nphilosophically (e.g., Bauer 2001; Lundgren-Gothlin 1991; Moi 2001;\nSimons 2001; Hein\u00e4maa 2003; Mann and Ferrari 2017); the\nhistorical and global receptions of The Second Sex (e.g.,\nChaperon 1999; Dongchao 2005; Coffin 2020; Rouch 2019 ; Chaperon and\nRouch 2020); the limitations of The Second Sex with regard to\nrace and ethnocentrism (e.g., Spelman 1988; Simons 2001; Deutscher\n2008; Belle 2010, 2014 and 2017; hooks 2012; Berruz 2016; Collins\n2017; Jones 2019; Altman 2020); her perspective on race and racism in\nAmerica Day by Day (e.g., Alfonso 2005; Bernasconi 2019;\nAltman 2020; Mussett 2020); Beauvoir\u2019s engagement with the\ninjustices of French colonialism and her position as a colonizer\n(e.g., Surkis 2010; Nya 2019); critical engagement with\nBeauvoir\u2019s life (e.g., Moi 2009) and personal writings (e.g.,\nTidd 1999b); and biographical projects (Bair 2002; Kirkpatrick\n2019).\n\nAdditionally, Beauvoir\u2019s work inspires feminist philosophical\nanalyses of various lived experiences, such as embodiment and\noppression (Young 1980; Bartky 1990; Burke 2019; Froidevaux-Mettiere\n2021), patriarchal love (Mann 2009), masculinity and nationalism (Mann\n2014), hook-up culture (Bauer 2017), #BlackGirlJoy (Mason 2018),\nstreet harassment (Vera-Gray 2018), feminine submission (Garcia 2018),\nbody positivity (Leboeuf 2019); trans subjectivity (Antonopoulos 2017;\nBurke 2020), non-monogamy (Kean 2018; Anderson 2021), #MeToo (McKinney\n2019; Melo Lopes 2021), obstetric violence (Shabot 2021), old age\n(Stoller 2014; Kruks 2022); rape (Bergoffen 2017); and authenticity\n(Cleary 2022).",
