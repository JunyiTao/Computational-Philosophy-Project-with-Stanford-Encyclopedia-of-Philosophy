    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\nThe phenomenal intentionality theory is a theory of\nintentionality, the \u201caboutness\u201d of mental states, on which phenomenal consciousness plays a central role in accounting for intentional states. Unlike many other contemporary theories of intentionality, which aim to account for intentionality in terms of causal relations, information, functional roles, or other \u201cnaturalistic\u201d ingredients, the phenomenal intentionality theory\u2019s main ingredient is phenomenal consciousness, the felt, subjective, or \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d (Nagel 1974) aspect\nof mental life. Accordingly, Pautz (2013) describes the general approach as taking a\n\u201cconsciousness first\u201d approach to intentionality, since it claims that consciousness either grounds or is explanatorily prior to intentionality, and Kriegel (2011a, 2013a) describes the approach as one\non which consciousness is the \u201csource\u201d of intentionality. (These ways of characterizing the phenomenal intentionality theory suggest a reductive picture, on which intentionality is reduced to or explained in terms of consciousness,\nbut in section 2.3 we will see that some versions of the phenomenal intentionality theory are not reductive.)\n\n\nBy explaining intentionality in terms of phenomenal consciousness, the phenomenal intentionality theory challenges the received view of the past few decades that the mind divides into two\nmutually exclusive and independent types of states: intentional states\nand phenomenal states (see Kim 1998 for a clear articulation of the\nreceived view). According to the phenomenal intentionality theory, intentional states and phenomenal\nstates are intimately related. Some intentional states are constituted by phenomenal states, and the rest are in some way importantly related to phenomenal states.\n\nPhenomenal intentionality has been discussed under that label only\nrecently (see, e.g., Horgan and Tienson 2002 and Loar 2003, and related\ninfluential work by Searle, Siewert, and others), but many modern\nphilosophers have suggested a close relation between thought, which is\ncharacteristically intentional, and perception, which is\ncharacteristically phenomenal, or consciousness itself. For example, rationalists\nsuch as Descartes held that all cognition is conscious, while empiricists such as Hume and Locke held that all cognition is grounded in perceptual experience. Later, Brentano, Husserl and the phenomenologists that they influenced conceived of intentionality\nprimarily as a conscious phenomenon. Like the phenomenal intentionality theory, the views of these figures can\nbe understood as taking a \u201cconsciousness first\u201d approach. For more on the history of the phenomenal intentionality theory, see Kriegel (2013a) and the entry Consciousness and Intentionality.\n \n\nIn this article we describe various versions of the phenomenal intentionality theory, their\nmotivations, the challenges they face, and their relations to other views.\n",
