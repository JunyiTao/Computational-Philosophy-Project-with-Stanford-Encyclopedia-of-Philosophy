    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Critical Philosophy of Mathematics || Kant\u2019s answer to his question \u201cHow is Pure Mathematics Possible?\u201d\n2.2 Kant\u2019s answer to his question \u201cHow is Pure Mathematics Possible?\u201d\n\nKant asks two related leading questions of his critical philosophy:\n(1) How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?; and, (2)\nHow is metaphysics possible as a science (B19; B23)? Mathematics\nprovides a special avenue for helping to answer these questions by\nproviding a model of a codified scientific discipline the possibility\nof which is clear and, moreover, guaranteed by its own achievement of\ncognition that is both synthetic and a priori (Anderson\n2015). In other words, an explanation of how synthetic a\npriori judgments are affirmed in mathematical contexts, together\nwith the resulting and related explanation of how a systematic body of\ndemonstrable knowledge comprises such judgments, allow mathematical\ntruth to be invoked as a paradigm of the substantive yet necessary and\nuniversal truths that metaphysics hopes to achieve. Kant\u2019s\ntheory of mathematical concept construction (discussed above) can only\nbe fully appreciated in conjunction with his treatment of such broader\nquestions about the very nature and possibility of mathematical and\nmetaphysical knowledge (Jauernig 2013).\n\nIn both the Preamble to the Prolegomena to Any Future\nMetaphysics and the B-Introduction to the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant introduces the analytic/synthetic distinction, which\ndistinguishes between judgments the predicates of which belong to or\nare contained in the subject concept and judgments the predicates of\nwhich are connected to but go beyond the subject concept,\nrespectively. In each text, he follows his presentation of this\ndistinction with a discussion of his claim that all mathematical\njudgments are synthetic and a\n priori.[4]\n There he claims, first, that \u201cproperly mathematical judgments\nare always a priori judgments\u201d on the grounds that they\nare necessary, and so cannot be derived from experience (B14). He\nfollows this with an explanation of how such non-empirical judgments\ncan yet be synthetic, that is, how they can serve to synthesize a\nsubject and predicate concept rather than merely explicate or analyze\na subject concept into its constituent logical parts.\n\nHere Kant famously invokes the arithmetical proposition \u201c7\n+ 5 = 12\u201d and argues that such a judgment is synthetic. He\nargues negatively, claiming that \u201cno matter how long I\nanalyze my concept of such a possible sum [of seven and five] I will\nstill not find twelve in it\u201d, and also positively, claiming that\n\u201cOne must go beyond these concepts [of seven and five], seeking\nassistance in the intuition that corresponds to one of the two,\none\u2019s five fingers, say\u2026and one after another add the\nunits of the five given in the intuition to the concept of\nseven\u2026and thus see the number 12 arise\u201d (B15). He takes\nit to follow that the necessary truth of an arithmetic proposition\nsuch as \u201c7 + 5 = 12\u201d cannot be established by any method\nof logical or conceptual analysis (Anderson 2004, 2015), but\ncan be established by intuitive synthesis (Parsons 1969).\nRecently, discussions of Kant\u2019s theory of arithmetic have\nshifted focus from questions about the syntheticity and apriority of\narithmetic judgments to investigations into Kant\u2019s account of\nnumber. Topics that arise here include ordinality and cardinality\n(Sutherland 2017, 2020); real numbers (Tait 2020; van Atten 2012);\nfinitism (Tait 2016; Sieg 2016); infinity and infinitesmals (Brittan\n2020; Smyth 2014, 2021; Warren 2020); and the centrality of the\nconcept of number in Kant\u2019s conception of the possibility of\nexperience (Carson 2020).\n\nKant follows his discussion of arithmetic reasoning and truth with\ncorresponding claims about Euclidean geometry, according to which the\nprinciples of geometry express synthetic relations between concepts\n(such as between the concept of the straight line between two points\nand the concept of the shortest line between those same two points),\nneither of which can be analytically \u201cextracted\u201d from the\nother. The principles of geometry thus express relations among basic\ngeometric concepts inasmuch as these can be \u201cexhibited in\nintuition\u201d (Shabel 2003; Sutherland 2005a). Elsewhere, Kant\nalso includes geometric theorems as the sorts of propositions\n(in addition to geometric principles) that count as synthetic, and\noffers thoughts about geometric proof (A716\u20137/B744\u20135) (Friedman\n1992, 2010; Shabel 2004). One way to understand the syntheticity\nof geometric theorems is by recognizing an indispensable diagrammatic\nrole for intuitions in geometric proof (Shabel 2004, 2004). \n\nNotably, the scope of Kant\u2019s claim that geometric theorems are\nsynthetic is not transparent. Having denied that the\nprinciples (Grunds\u00e4tze) could be cognized analytically\nfrom the principle of contradiction, he admits that mathematical\ninference of the kind needed to establish geometric theorems\ndoes proceed \u201cin accordance with the principle of\ncontradiction\u201d, and also that \u201ca synthetic proposition can\nof course be comprehended in accordance with the principle of\ncontradiction\u201d though \u201conly insofar as another synthetic\nproposition is presupposed from which it can be deduced, never in\nitself\u201d (B14). So, while he is clear that all mathematical\njudgments, including geometric theorems, are synthetic, he is less\nclear about exactly what it means for such propositions or the\ninferences that support them to \u201caccord with\u201d the\nprinciple of contradiction, derivability from which he takes to be the\nparadigm test of analyticity (Hogan 2020). This\nleads to an interpretive disagreement as to whether demonstrable\nmathematical judgments follow from the synthetic principles via\nstrictly logical or conceptual inference\u2014and so in strict\naccordance with only the principle of contradiction\u2014or\nwhether they are deduced via inferences that are themselves reliant on\nintuition, but which do not violate the law of contradiction. There is\nthus disagreement over whether Kant is committed merely to the\nsyntheticity of the axioms of mathematics (which transmit syntheticity\nto demonstrable theorems via logical inference), or is also committed\nto the syntheticity of mathematical inference itself. The former\ninterpretive position is originally associated with Ernst Cassirer and\nLewis White Beck; the latter position with Bertrand Russell (Hogan\n2020). Gordon Brittan (Brittan 2006) conceives both such positions\n\u201cevidentialist\u201d, which is his label for any interpretation\naccording to which intuitions provide indispensable evidence for the\ntruth of mathematics, whether that evidence is provided in support of\naxioms or inferences, or both (Brittan 2006).\n\nAttention to this interpretive issue in Kant\u2019s philosophy of\nmathematics is vital for the light it sheds on the more general\nquestion of what makes synthetic a priori cognition possible,\nthe central question of Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason.\nWith respect to this more general question, it is important to\ndifferentiate Kant\u2019s use of the terms \u201canalytic\u201d and\n\u201csynthetic\u201d to mark a logico-semantic distinction between\ntypes of judgments\u2014which Kant uses to defend the distinctive\nthesis that mathematical cognition is synthetic a\npriori\u2014from his use of the same terms to mark a traditional\nmathematical distinction, between analytic and synthetic\nmethods. He deploys the latter distinction in order to\nidentify two distinct argumentative strategies for answering the\nquestion of the \u201cpossibility of pure mathematics.\u201d The\nanalytic method is characterized by reasoning that traces a given body\nof cognition, such as mathematics, to its origin or sources in the\nmind. By contrast, the synthetic method aims to derive real cognition\ndirectly from such original cognitive sources, which sources or powers\nare first explicated independently of any particular body of cognition\n(including mathematics) that the powers might ultimately produce. Kant\nadopts the former method in his Prolegomena, arguing from the\nsynthetic and a priori nature of mathematical judgment to the\nclaim that space and time are the forms of human sensibility; he\nadopts the latter method in the Critique of Pure Reason,\narguing that the forms of human sensibility, space and time, provide\nthe basis from which to derive synthetic and a priori\nmathematical judgments (Shabel 2004). These arguments, together with\nthe details of his account of the synthetic and a priori\nnature of all mathematical judgment, provide an answer to the question\nof the possibility of mathematics: the practices that yield the\nparadigmatically synthetic and a priori judgments of the\nscience of mathematics are grounded in and explained by the very\nnature of human sensibility, and, in particular, by the\nspatio-temporal form of all (and only) the objects of human experience\n(Van Cleve 1999). But, this answer raises further questions, in\nparticular about how to distinguish between metaphysical and geometric\nrepresentations of space (Carson 1997; Friedman 2000, 2015, 2020; Onof\nand Schulting 2014; Tolley 2016).\n",
