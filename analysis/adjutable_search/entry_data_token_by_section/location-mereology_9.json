    "main_text": "Interpenetration || Against Interpenetration #1: from Supersubstantivalism\n4.5 Against Interpenetration #1: from Supersubstantivalism\n\nSupersubstantivalism is often glossed as the view that each material\nobject is identical to the spacetime region at which the object is\nexactly\n located.[7]\n If supersubstantivalism is not just true but necessary, then it is\nimpossible for disjoint material objects to be exactly\nlocated at overlapping regions. After all, if material object x\nis exactly located at region r1 and material object\ny is exactly located at r2, and\nr1 and r2 overlap, then, given\nsupersubstantivalism, x=r1 and\ny=r2, and hence x and y overlap\nas well.\n\nThis gives us an argument for (2), the version of No Interpenetration\nrestricted to material objects. (However, (2) conflicts with the\npossibility of Sanford's interpenetrating blocks, so the argument will\nbe controversial.) But the argument does not give us an argument for\nNo Interpenetration. For it wouldn't follow that it is impossible for\nthere to be disjoint entities of any kind to have overlapping exact\nlocations. Supersubstantivalism, as stated above, leaves open the\npossibility that there are universals or tropes, e.g., that are\nexactly located at regions but not identical to them. Hence it leaves\nopen the possibility that disjoint entities that are not material\nobjects might have overlapping exact locations.\n\nTo construct an argument for No Interpenetration, we would need to\nappeal to a stronger supersubstantivalist doctrine, for example:\n\nSupersubstantivalism+\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y[L(x, y)\n\u2192 x=y]\n\nNecessarily, each entity is identical to anything at which it is\nexactly located.\n\n\nSupersubstantivalism+ entails No Interpenetration. Take any objects\nx and y in any possible world, and suppose that they\nhave exact locations, r1 and r2\nrespectively, that overlap. Then, given Supersubstantivalism+,\nx=r1 and y=r2, hence\nx and y overlap.\n\nFor a second, related argument against interpenetration, see Section\n1.2 of the supplementary document\n Additional Arguments.\n",
