    "main_text": "Extensions || The Social Sciences\n3.2 The Social Sciences\n\nAlthough Schutz defended Weber against Mises, he agreed with many\nbasic premises of Mises and the Austrian tradition that focused on the\nsubjective preferences of the purchaser conferring value on objects\ninstead of explaining value as the result of objective processes such\nas production costs or labor time invested. He also shared\nMises\u2019s suppositions about value-freedom in economic science,\nthe need to describe rather than evaluate preferences, and the\ninstrumental task of science, namely, of showing how to achieve ends\nrather than assessing their value. Since Mises considered all acting\neconomic insofar as any consumer choice involved maximizing\nsatisfaction in the widest sense, he opposed the narrow type of the\nhomo economicus, modeled on the businessperson driven solely\nby economic motives at the expense of all others. Schutz, however,\nposited the life-world with its wide diversity of motivations at the\nbase of economic theory. He conceived such theory as adopting a\nreflective perspective governed by the principle of marginal utility,\nnamely, that ideal types ought to be constructed as if all\nactors \u201chad oriented their life-plans to realize the greatest\nutility with minimal cost.\u201d (Schutz 1964, 87) Besides thus\nresuscitating a version of homo economicus, Schutz insisted\nthat economists study purposive-rational actions, which, in\nWeber\u2019s sense, involved a reflective comparison of alternative\nprojects before adopting one as an in-order-to motive. In addition, he\nclassified the sense of uneasiness that Mises described as prompting\nthe search for satisfaction under the category of because motives; one\nfirst adopts an rationally determined economic project and in\nretrospect discovers the preceding dissatisfaction. To understand the\ndifference between conceiving all action as economic and conceiving\neconomic action as one type of action within an more encompassing\nlife-world, one might compare Mises with Schutz with reference to a\nproblem raised within contemporary discussions of collective action,\nnamely, how traditional non-economic values (e.g., those of politics\nor ethics) ought to intersect the market. Mises would countenance\neconomic agents registering their values economically, that is, by\ndeciding to purchase or not (e.g. as a protest against polluting\ncompanies), thereby converting all values into economic ones, whereas\nSchutz would call for a process negotiating the boundaries between\ndifferent life-world value domains.\n\nIn \u201cConcept and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences,\u201d\nSchutz addressed the broader issue of the relationship between\nphilosophy and the social sciences in general. In that essay, Schutz\nresponded to Ernest Nagel\u2019s positivistic view that the social\nsciences should make use of natural scientific methods, identifying\nevidence with sensory observable data and criticizing the Weberian\nmethod of \u201cunderstanding\u201d as appealing to uncontrollable\nand unverifiable introspection. Schutz agreed with Nagel on several\ncounts, namely that social scientists needed to validate theoretical\nbeliefs, that lack of predictability in the social sciences did not\ndisqualify their scientific character, and that Weber would have been\nwrong if his method of \u201csubjective interpretation\u201d implied\nempathy with unobservable, introspective states. The problem was,\nthough, that the natural scientific approach to the social sciences,\ninsofar as it separated verifiable observable behavior from\nunverifiable inner states (purposes, emotions), seemed to play on the\nmap drawn by Descartes who divorced body from mind and allowed only\nstatements about the former to be scientifically verifiable. Further,\nthe natural scientific approach depended on a basic presupposition\nsince without first examining the object of social\nscience\u2014social reality, in Schutz\u2019s terms\u2014one would\nbe simply presupposing that the methods of the natural sciences were\nappropriate to its study. Therefore, Schutz attempted first to clarify\nsocial reality, described in depth by his own phenomenology of the\nsocial world, and to indicate how actors sustain that reality by\nunderstanding each other\u2019s in-order-to motives in typical terms\n(e.g., going to school, making a purchase, marrying). Such mutual\nunderstanding takes place without either somehow or other penetrating\ninto the other\u2019s private, inner sanctum, or reducing the other\nto the status of animal organism responding to stimuli. Given this\naccount of social reality, in which actors give meaning to their\nworld, as opposed to physical reality whose objects (e.g., electrons,\nquarks) do not interpret their world, Schutz argued that the\nappropriate social scientific method involved developing constructs of\neveryday actor\u2019s constructs. Social scientific constructs, ideal\ntypes in Weber\u2019s sense, aimed at capturing the subjective\nmeaning of the actor, that is, according to Weber\u2019s intentions,\nthe meaning of the actor as opposed to the social scientist and not\nsome introspective inner process. Schutz conceived statistical and\nother formulations of social scientific laws as a legitimate kind of\nintellectual shorthand, always presupposing the meaningful activity of\nthe individual social actor, the \u201cforgotten man\u201d of the\nsocial sciences (Schutz 1964, 6\u20137). To ensure the kind of\nvalidation that Nagel sought, mistakenly though, by restricting\nhimself to sensory observable data, Schutz proposed that social\nscientists displace their everyday practical interests in favor of a\nguiding interest in accurate scientific description and observe\npostulates of logical consistency and adequacy to the experiences\ndescribed.\n\nIn order to elucidate the meaning of rational action, Schutz\nhypothesized what a rational actor would have to know, even though\nsuch completely rational actions might never be realized in everyday\nlife. Such an actor would have to know: an end\u2019s relationship\nwith other ends, the consequences and by-products of realizing an end,\nthe means suitable for the end, the interaction of such means with\nother ends and means, and the accessibility of those means. In\naddition, the rational actor would need to understand: her\ninteractors\u2019 understanding of all the previous factors, the\ninterpretation of her act by others, the reactions of other people and\ntheir motivation, and the useful categories she had already discovered\nin the social world. Although social scientists might use such models\nof completely rational action to assess the rationality of everyday\nactors, Schutz cautioned social scientists that if their task were to\ndescribe life-world actors, they also needed to be wary of replacing\nthe viewpoint of everyday actors with a fictional, non-existing world\nconstructed by scientific observers. In fact, a central point of\ndiscussion in the published correspondence between Schutz and Talcott\nParsons concerned the subjective viewpoint of the actor, whose\nsub-acts, for example, could not be adequately understood without\ncomprehending the actor\u2019s overarching project, whose temporal\nspan is at first accessible only to that actor. Finally, it should be\nnoted that Schutz himself produced two pieces of applied research in\nwhich he constructed ideal types of the Stranger and the Homecomer,\ntaking account of what their experiences meant to them instead of what\nsocial scientists or others might think they meant.\n",
