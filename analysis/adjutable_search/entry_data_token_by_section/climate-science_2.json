    "main_text": "Climate Data\n3. Climate Data\n\nThe sources and types of observational data employed in climate\nscience are tremendously varied. Data are collected not only at\nland-based stations, but also on ships and buoys in the ocean, on\nairplanes, on satellites that orbit the earth, by drilling into\nancient ice at earth\u2019s poles, by examining tree rings and ocean\nsediments, and in other ways. Many challenges arise as climate\nscientists attempt to use these varied data to answer questions about\nclimate and climate change. These challenges stem both from the\ncharacter of the data\u2014they are gappy in space and time, and they\nare obtained from instruments and other sources that have limited\nlifespans and that vary in quality and resolution\u2014and from the\nnature of the questions that climate scientists seek to address, which\ninclude questions about long-term changes on a global scale.\n\nTo try to overcome these challenges, climate scientists employ a rich\ncollection of data modeling practices (Edwards 2010; Frigg et\nal. 2015b). These are practices that take available observations and\napply various procedures for quality control, correction, synthesis\nand transformation. Some of these practices will be highlighted below,\nin the course of introducing three important types of climate dataset:\nstation-based datasets\n (Section 3.1),\n reanalyses\n (Section 3.2),\n and paleoclimate reconstructions\n (Section 3.3).\n Because of the extensive data modeling involved in their production,\nthese datasets are often referred to as data products. As the\ndiscussion below will suggest, an interesting feature of data modeling\npractices in climate science is that they tend to be dynamic and\niterative: data models for nearly the same set of historical\nobservations are further and further refined, to address limitations\nof previous efforts.\n",
