    "main_text": "Quantum Mechanics as a Probability Calculus || The Reconstruction of QM\n1.4 The Reconstruction of QM\n\nFrom the single premise that the \u201cexperimental\npropositions\u201d associated with a physical system are encoded by\nprojections in the way indicated above, one can reconstruct the rest\nof the formal apparatus of quantum mechanics. The first step, of\ncourse, is Gleason\u2019s theorem, which tells us that probability\nmeasures on \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) correspond to density operators. There\nremains to recover, e.g., the representation of\n\u201cobservables\u201d by self-adjoint operators, and the dynamics\n(unitary evolution). The former can be recovered with the help of the\nSpectral theorem and the latter with the aid of a deep theorem of E.\nWigner on the projective representation of groups. See also R. Wright\n[1980]. A detailed outline of this reconstruction (which involves some\ndistinctly non-trivial mathematics) can be found in the book of\nVaradarajan [1985]. The point to bear in mind is that, once the\nquantum-logical skeleton \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is in place, the remaining\nstatistical and dynamical apparatus of quantum mechanics is\nessentially fixed. In this sense, then, quantum mechanics\u2014or, at\nany rate, its mathematical framework\u2014reduces to quantum\nlogic and its attendant probability theory.\n",
