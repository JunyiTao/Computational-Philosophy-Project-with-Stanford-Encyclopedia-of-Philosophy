    "main_text": "Logic and Methodology\n2. Logic and Methodology\n\nThe general character of Ibn Rushd\u2019s philosophy is illuminated\nby his overarching picture of logic. Most broadly, he understands it\nas the study of the conditions and rules that rightly guide the mind\ntoward the conception (ta\u1e63awwur) of essences and the\nassent (ta\u1e63d\u012bq) to propositions\n(CompLogic 1.1). Glossing Aristotle\u2019s famous remark\nthat \u201cit is the mark of the educated person\u201d to seek the\nappropriate level of precision in any inquiry, Ibn Rushd clarifies\nthat the educated person is \u201cone who has been instructed in the\nart of logic\u201d (ParaEthics I.3, 3C).\n\nIn keeping with the weight he accords the subject, Ibn Rushd commented\nseveral times on each work in Aristotle\u2019s logical\nOrganon. Near the start of his career, he wrote a\nCompendium of Logic that includes Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge and follows the usual Arabic practice of including\nthe Rhetoric and Poetics as part of an expanded\nOrganon (Black 1990). Later, he wrote a series of longer\nparaphrases of this same corpus (but treated the Isagoge\nseparately, on the grounds that it is neither an introduction to nor\neven a part of logic). Toward the end of his life, he devoted one of\nhis five long commentaries to the Posterior Analytics.\n\nIn line with the approach of his predecessors, Ibn Rushd divided\nlogical processes into five types of argument: demonstrative,\ndialectical, rhetorical, poetical, and fallacious. These inferences\nare not distinguished by their forms, which are the same, but by their\nmatter, that is, by their premises. The premises of demonstrative\narguments are necessary (Thom 2019), the premises of dialectical\narguments are generally accepted, the premises of rhetoric are\ngenerally received, the premises of poetic arguments are imaginative,\nand the premises of sophistical arguments are deceiving.\n\nFor Ibn Rushd, the center of logic and its very purpose is\ndemonstration, for it is the only procedure that leads to certainty in\nphilosophy: it is \u201cthe most perfect kind of reflection\n(na\u1e93ar), using the most perfect kind of inference\n(qiy\u0101s)\u201d (Decisive Treatise 3).\nAccordingly, even in the context of Plato\u2019s Republic,\nhe begins his commentary by announcing that his goal is \u201cto\nabstract such scientific arguments attributable to Plato as are\ncontained in the Republic by removing from it its dialectical\narguments.\u201d However, this does not mean that non-demonstrative\narguments are useless. Generally, where one kind of argument is not\neffective, other kinds of arguments should be used. Dialectic offers a\npath toward demonstration and to science, which, although it does not\nobtain certainty, is close to it. Rhetoric contributes, through its\nparadigms and enthymemes, to reinforcing and promoting demonstrative\nevidence. The study of sophistical reasoning is useful in assessing\nthe faulty argumentative methods of the theologians (the\nmutakallim\u016bn, that is, practitioners of\nkal\u0101m).\n\nIn light of the high status of demonstration, Ibn Rushd considered it\nwith great care in his commentaries. He devoted a compendium, a\nparaphrase and a long commentary to the Posterior\nAnalytics\u2014which he calls the Book of Demonstration\n(Kit\u0101b al-Burh\u0101n)\u2014and wrote separate\ntreatises on various special issues. The long commentary is probably\nthe most appropriate text for his positions on the components of\ndemonstration, its types, and its role in producing scientific\nknowledge. That commentary is also the occasion for a critical and\nsevere interaction with the two Islamic authorities in logic before\nhim, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101.\n\nThe purpose of examining demonstrative arguments is to understand the\nabsolute demonstration that gives complete certainty and constitutes a\nscience (LongPostAn I.7 {180}). There are, however, other\nkinds of demonstration, less certain than the absolute one, but still\ndemonstrative. In all, Ibn Rushd distinguishes three types\n(LongPostAn I.95 {348}):\n\nan absolute demonstration (burh\u0101n mu\u1e6dlaq),\nwhich establishes the existence of a thing on the basis of a cause\nthat is known prior to its effect;\na demonstration of existence (burh\u0101n al-wuj\u016bd),\nwhich he calls a sign (dal\u012bl), which establishes a\nthing\u2019s existence without any grasp of its cause (see\nElamrani-Jamal 2000);\na demonstration of the cause (burh\u0101n al-\u02bfilla\nor burh\u0101n al-sabab), which establishes the cause once\nthe effect\u2019s existence is known. (Al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b\n1986b)\n\n\nIn mathematics, it is generally possible to frame absolute\ndemonstrations, because the premises both supply the cause and are\nbetter known than their conclusions. In the natural sciences, however,\nand even in metaphysics, this ideal situation is generally not\nachievable. Here we begin with the accidental sensible features of\nthings, and so extensive use must be made of the demonstration of\nexistence (EpiPhys 1.105 {9}; Sylla 1979; Cerami 2014). Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, whose views are often the target of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\nlogic, had denied that these count as a demonstration at all, on the\ngrounds that they establish no substantial connection between the\nposterior cause and the prior effect. Ibn Rushd rejects this view\n(LongPostAn I.95 {349}), but admits that the demonstration of\nexistence is less reliable than the other demonstrations. Certainty\ncomes in degrees, and the differentiation in certainty between these\ndemonstrations is one of the reasons why some sciences are superior to\nothers (ParaPostAn \u00a788\u20139).\n\nIbn Rushd\u2019s enthusiasm for demonstration does not prevent him\nfrom valuing other logical arts, and he was particularly concerned\nwith the place of dialectic. Broadly speaking, according to Aristotle,\ndialectic has three main uses: as intellectual training, as a path\ninto the demonstrative sciences of philosophy, and as a means of\nconversing with ordinary people (Topics I.2). But Ibn Rushd\ndevotes less space and shows less interest in this third feature of\ndialectic, and one wonders whether this is due to his critical\nreaction to the discursive practices of the\nmutakallim\u016bn. Despite the many considerations that make\ndialectic more suitable when dealing with ordinary people, Ibn Rushd\nsuggests that rhetorical and poetic statements are preferable\n(ParaTop I.5C {31}; Ben Ahmed 2010-2011, 299\u2013302,\n307\u201317). Hence their inclusion in the expanded Organon.\nThe significance of rhetoric and poetics is a result he establishes in\npolitical science, but maintains even when it comes to teaching and\nanchoring theological truths. The bad example set by the dialectical\nsyllogisms of the mutakallim\u016bn shows how dialectical\nmethods, in discussion with ordinary people, are actually\ndisadvantageous.\n\nUnder the influence of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn Rushd puts\nemphasis on the need to introduce dialectic as a method\n(\u1e6dar\u012bq), a set of rules, techniques, and warnings\n(Ben Ahmed 2020a, 262\u20137). This conception of dialectic makes it\ndistinct from both demonstration and sophistical reasoning, as well as\nfrom ordinary conversations. When used well, dialectic is a communal\nenterprise and so again different from other arts, such as\ndemonstration, where there is no need for more than one party. A\nsuccessful \u201cpartnership\u201d in dialectic is one where each\nparty does their best to commit themselves to the rules. From this\nperspective, it becomes evident that the questioner is not simply an\nadversary seeking to defeat his opponent, but rather a partner and a\ncollaborator with the respondent in the search for knowledge. Any\ndebate that is motivated by the pursuit of victory or by deriving\npleasure from defeating one\u2019s opponent is a debate that cannot\nfall under the method of dialectic. He writes, \u201cthe communal\nenterprise (al-\u02bfamal al-mushtarak) can be achieved in\nits utmost perfection only by both partners. They can have something\nin common when their aim is the assessment and the deduction of the\ntruth, or the realization of their training. Thus, the respondent\nshould perfect his response if he intends that aim, because the basest\nof the partners is the one who aims at the obstruction of the communal\nenterprise. But if their aim is to struggle against and defeat the\nother, then they will have nothing in common\u2026. This is not the\nmethod of dialectic\u201d (ParaTop 8.132D {233}; Ben Ahmed\n2020a, 267)\n\nAt the far reaches of the logical arts, the connection to the genuine\nsyllogism becomes remote. So, even while Ibn Rushd recognizes that\npoetics is a syllogistic art, he says that it lacks the power of a\nreal syllogism and is thus unproductive (CompLogic 12.3). In\nhis paraphrase of the Poetics, he avoids using the term\n\u201cpoetic syllogism\u201d altogether.\n\nIn the realm of jurisprudence, Ibn Rushd is famous for his position on\nthe logical and epistemological value of juridical inferences, which\nin his view produce nothing more than opinion\n(\u1e93ann). Even when confronted with the\nsurprising insertion of the word for jurisprudence (fiqh)\ninto the Arabic translation of the Prior Analytics 68b10, Ibn\nRushd chooses totally to ignore it. In his juridical writings, he\nopenly denies the accuracy of the term \u2018syllogism\u2019\n(qiy\u0101s) for what jurists had become accustomed to\ncalling their juridical inferences (al-maq\u0101y\u012bs\nal-fiqhiyya or qiy\u0101s shar\u02bf\u012b).\nWhen jurists speak of qiy\u0101s, it is important to\nrecognize that the term bears quite a different meaning\n(Abridgement 299 {130\u20131}; Bou Akl 2019). In particular,\ncontrary to what happens in the syllogism, the qiy\u0101s of\nthe jurists does not have the power to deduce the unknown from the\nknown. And even in those cases where Ibn Rushd seems to accept\njuridical inference, he does not make use of logical vocabulary, but\ninstead deploys the terms used by most of the jurists before him.\nRather than engage in a \u201csyllogistification\u201d of the\njuridical inference, he focuses on the semantic and linguistic origins\nof juridical rules. For Ibn Rushd, every science has its own\ncharacteristics; therefore, anyone who tried to study logic while\nstudying jurisprudence would fail at studying both\n(Abridgement 123 {37\u201338}).\n",
