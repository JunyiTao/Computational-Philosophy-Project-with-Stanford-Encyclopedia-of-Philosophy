    "main_text": "The Ethics of Forgiveness || Skepticism About the Morality of Forgiveness\n10. The Science of Forgiveness\n\nFor much of the history of modern psychology, the topic of forgiveness\nwas largely ignored. Piaget (1932) discussed the capacity of\nforgiveness so far as it is related to the development of moral\njudgment. Litwinski (1945) produced a study on the kind of affective\nstructure that would provide one with a capacity to forgive. Emerson\n(1964) was the first to explore the association of forgiveness with\nmental health, and Heider (1958) proposed an early working definition\nof forgiveness (as the forgoing of vengeful behavior). Rokeach (1973)\npromoted forgiveness as a valuable form of conduct, but didn\u2019t\nsay much about its nature. Discussions of forgiveness as it relates to\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma situations and tit-for-tat strategies were\nnot uncommon (e.g., Gahagan & Tedeschi 1968)\u2014the idea being\nthat forgiveness could be likened to a cooperative move following a\ncompetitive move.\n\nIn the recent decades, forgiveness has enjoyed a significant increase\nin empirical attention (McCullough, et al. 2000: 6, 7). Important\nearly work during this time included papers by Boon and Sulsky (1997),\nDarby and Schlenker (1982), and Weiner, et al. (1991). Yet even after\ndecades of sustained empirical enquiry, psychologists remain divided\nabout how forgiveness ought to be defined. The \u201cmajor issue\ncharacterizing this new science of forgiveness\u201d, Everett\nWorthington writes, \u201chas been how forgiveness ought to be\ndefined\u201d (2005: 3).\n\nSome psychologists forward interpersonal models of forgiveness.\nAccording to these approaches, forgiveness is an activity involving\ncommunication (perhaps verbal, perhaps not) between agents.\nReconciliation-based models of forgiveness developed out of\nresearch in evolutionary psychology and evolutionary ethics (Sapolsky\n& Share 2004; de Waal & Pokorny 2005; Axelrod 1980a,b).\nAccording to these views, forgiveness evolved as a mechanism for\naffirming mutual cooperation between agents after an act of\ndefection.\n\nOthers have sought to define forgiveness by way of intrapersonal\nmodels. According to these models, forgiveness occurs within\none\u2019s skin, as it were. DiBlasio\u2019s (1998)\ndecision-based model views forgiveness \u201cas an act of\nthe will, a choice to let go or hold onto\u201d resentment,\nbitterness and the need for vengeance (1998: 76). McCullough and\nvarious colleagues have posited a motivational model that\nunderstands forgiveness as a process involving a decrease in\nmotivations to avoid or seek revenge, and an increase in benevolent\nand conciliatory motivations (e.g., McCullough, Fincham, & Tsang\n2003). Cognitive models conceive of forgiveness as a\nreframing of the narrative about the transgression, the transgressor\nand the forgiver (e.g., Gordon, Baucom, & Snyder 2000; Thompson,\net al. 2005). One forgives by changing one\u2019s assumptions,\nbeliefs, standards, or perceptions about the wrongdoer and the\nwrongdoing. Emotion-based models see forgiveness as being\naccomplished by the replacement of negative, unforgiving emotions\n(e.g., anger, hatred) with positive, other-oriented emotions (e.g.,\nempathy) (Worthington 2003; Malcolm & Greenberg 2000).\n\nStill others have suggested mixed models, according to which\nforgiveness has both interpersonal and intrapersonal modes or aspects.\nBaumeister, Exline, and Sommer (1998) suggest that when one feels\nforgiving towards an offender but does not communicate as much, one\nhas silently forgiven. Alternatively, when one does\nnot feel forgiving but tells the offender that she is forgiving her,\nshe accomplishes hollow forgiveness. When one both feels\nforgiving and tells the offender so, she has accomplished full\nforgiveness. Enright and Fitzgibbons (2000) have argued that in\norder to forgive, cognitive, affective, and behavioral changes must be\nmade. \n\nAs it should be clear, there is significant disagreement about the\nnature of forgiveness in the psychological sciences, leading one\nprominent psychologist of forgiveness to write that \u201cno\nconsensual definition of forgiveness exists\u201d (McCullough, et al.\n2000: 7).\n",
