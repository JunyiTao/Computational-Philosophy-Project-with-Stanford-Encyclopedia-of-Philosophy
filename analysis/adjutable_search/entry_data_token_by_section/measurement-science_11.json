    "main_text": "Model-Based Accounts of Measurement || The roles of models in measurement\n7.1 The roles of models in measurement\n\nAccording to model-based accounts, measurement involves interaction\nbetween an object of interest (the \u201csystem under\nmeasurement\u201d), an instrument (the \u201cmeasurement\nsystem\u201d) and an environment, which includes the measuring\nsubjects. Other, secondary interactions may also be relevant for the\ndetermination of a measurement outcome, such as the interaction\nbetween the measuring instrument and the reference standards used for\nits calibration, and the chain of comparisons that trace the reference\nstandard back to primary measurement standards (Mari 2003: 25).\nMeasurement proceeds by representing these interactions with a set of\nparameters, and assigning values to a subset of those parameters\n(known as \u201cmeasurands\u201d) based on the results of the\ninteractions. When measured parameters are numerical they are called\n\u201cquantities\u201d. Although measurands need not be quantities,\na quantitative measurement scenario will be supposed in what\nfollows.\n\nTwo sorts of measurement outputs are distinguished by model-based\naccounts [JCGM 2012: 2.9 & 4.1; Giordani and Mari 2012: 2146; Tal\n2013]:\n\nInstrument indications (or\n\u201creadings\u201d): these are properties of the measuring\ninstrument in its final state after the measurement process is\ncomplete. Examples are digits on a display, marks on a multiple-choice\nquestionnaire and bits stored in a device\u2019s memory. Indications\nmay be represented by numbers, but such numbers describe states of the\ninstrument and should not be confused with measurement outcomes, which\nconcern states of the object being measured.\nMeasurement outcomes (or \u201cresults\u201d):\nthese are knowledge claims about the values of one or more quantities\nattributed to the object being measured, and are typically accompanied\nby a specification of the measurement unit and scale and an estimate\nof measurement uncertainty. For example, a measurement outcome may be\nexpressed by the sentence \u201cthe mass of object a is\n20\u00b11 grams with a probability of 68%\u201d.\n\n\nAs proponents of model-based accounts stress, inferences from\ninstrument indications to measurement outcomes are nontrivial and\ndepend on a host of theoretical and statistical assumptions about the\nobject being measured, the instrument, the environment and the\ncalibration process. Measurement outcomes are often obtained through\nstatistical analysis of multiple indications, thereby involving\nassumptions about the shape of the distribution of indications and the\nrandomness of environmental effects (Bogen and Woodward 1988:\n307\u2013310). Measurement outcomes also incorporate corrections for\nsystematic effects, and such corrections are based on theoretical\nassumptions concerning the workings of the instrument and its\ninteractions with the object and environment. For example, length\nmeasurements need to be corrected for the change of the measuring\nrod\u2019s length with temperature, a correction which is derived\nfrom a theoretical equation of thermal expansion. Systematic\ncorrections involve uncertainties of their own, for example in the\ndetermination of the values of constants, and these uncertainties are\nassessed through secondary experiments involving further theoretical\nand statistical assumptions. Moreover, the uncertainty associated with\na measurement outcome depends on the methods employed for the\ncalibration of the instrument. Calibration involves additional\nassumptions about the instrument, the calibrating apparatus, the\nquantity being measured and the properties of measurement standards\n(Rothbart and Slayden 1994; Franklin 1997; Baird 2004: Ch. 4; Soler et\nal. 2013). Another component of uncertainty originates from vagueness\nin the definition of the measurand, and is known as\n\u201cdefinitional uncertainty\u201d (Mari and Giordani 2013;\nGr\u00e9gis 2015). Finally, measurement involves background\nassumptions about the scale type and unit system being used, and these\nassumptions are often tied to broader theoretical and technological\nconsiderations relating to the definition and realization of scales\nand units.\n\nThese various theoretical and statistical assumptions form the basis\nfor the construction of one or more models of the measurement process.\nUnlike mathematical theories of measurement, where the term\n\u201cmodel\u201d denotes a set-theoretical structure that\ninterprets a formal language, here the term \u201cmodel\u201d\ndenotes an abstract and local representation of a target system that\nis constructed from simplifying\n assumptions.[17]\n The relevant target system in this case is a measurement process,\nthat is, a system composed of a measuring instrument, objects or\nevents to be measured, the environment (including human operators),\nsecondary instruments and reference standards, the time-evolution of\nthese components, and their various interactions with each other.\nMeasurement is viewed as a set of procedures whose aim is to\ncoherently assign values to model parameters based on instrument\nindications. Models are therefore seen as necessary preconditions for\nthe possibility of inferring measurement outcomes from instrument\nindications, and as crucial for determining the content of measurement\noutcomes. As proponents of model-based accounts emphasize, the same\nindications produced by the same measurement process may be used to\nestablish different measurement outcomes depending on how the\nmeasurement process is modeled, e.g., depending on which environmental\ninfluences are taken into account, which statistical assumptions are\nused to analyze noise, and which approximations are used in applying\nbackground theory. As Luca Mari puts it, \n\n\nany measurement result reports information that is meaningful only in\nthe context of a metrological model, such a model being required to\ninclude a specification for all the entities that explicitly or\nimplicitly appear in the expression of the measurement result. (2003:\n25) \n\n\nSimilarly, models are said to provide the necessary context for\nevaluating various aspects of the goodness of measurement outcomes,\nincluding accuracy, precision, error and uncertainty (Boumans 2006,\n2007a, 2009, 2012b; Mari 2005b).\n\nModel-based accounts diverge from empiricist interpretations of\nmeasurement theory in that they do not require relations among\nmeasurement outcomes to be isomorphic or homomorphic to observable\nrelations among the items being measured (Mari 2000). Indeed,\naccording to model-based accounts relations among measured objects\nneed not be observable at all prior to their measurement (Frigerio et\nal. 2010: 125). Instead, the key normative requirement of model-based\naccounts is that values be assigned to model parameters in a coherent\nmanner. The coherence criterion may be viewed as a conjunction of two\nsub-criteria: (i) coherence of model assumptions with relevant\nbackground theories or other substantive presuppositions about the\nquantity being measured; and (ii) objectivity, i.e., the mutual\nconsistency of measurement outcomes across different measuring\ninstruments, environments and\n models[18]\n (Frigerio et al. 2010; Tal 2017a; Teller 2018). The first\nsub-criterion is meant to ensure that the intended quantity\nis being measured, while the second sub-criterion is meant to ensure\nthat measurement outcomes can be reasonably attributed to the measured\nobject rather than to some artifact of the measuring\ninstrument, environment or model. Taken together, these two\nrequirements ensure that measurement outcomes remain valid\nindependently of the specific assumptions involved in their\nproduction, and hence that the context-dependence of measurement\noutcomes does not threaten their general applicability.\n",
