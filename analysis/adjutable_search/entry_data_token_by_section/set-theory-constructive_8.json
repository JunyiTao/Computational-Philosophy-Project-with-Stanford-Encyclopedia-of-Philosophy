    "main_text": "Proof Theory and Semantics of Constructive and Intuitionistic ZF || Proof-theoretic strength\n5.1 Proof-theoretic strength\n\nA fundamental theme in proof theory (in particular in the branch of\nthis discipline known as ordinal analysis) is the classification of\ntheories by means of transfinite ordinals which measure their\n\"consistency strength\" and \"computational power\".  These ordinals give\nan indication of how strong a theory is, and therefore offer a way of\ncomparing different theories. For example, the ordinal\n\\(\\varepsilon_0\\) is the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano Arithmetic,\nand is much smaller than the ordinal \\(\\Gamma_0\\), usually referred to\nas \"the limit of predicativity\" \n (see section 1.3 above). \n This is indicative that there are predicatively acceptable theories\nwhich are much stronger than Peano Arithmetic. \n\nAs discussed in section 1, the step\nfrom classical ZF to its intuitionistic variants requires us to choose\na suitable formulation for each set-theoretic axiom: one classical \naxiom may have a number of intuitionistic variants which turn out to be \nnon-equivalent to each other. This is sometimes reflected by the proof-theoretic\nstrength of the resulting theories, which may vary depending on which principles we choose. \nFor example, we already noted that \nin CZF we do not have full separation and power set, which are \nreplaced by the predicatively acceptable principles of bounded separation and \nsubset collection, respectively. However, if\nwe add to CZF either of these principles, we obtain impredicative\ntheories. The impredicativity of the resulting theories is witnessed \nby the fact that their proof-theoretic strenght far exceeds that of CZF.\n\nIt is not surprising that investigations on the proof-theoretic\nstrength of constructive and intutionistic set theories have been a\ncrucial meta-theoretical tool for understanding these theories and\ntheir relations with each other. Investigations on the\nproof-theoretic strength of a theory are rich and informative. In\nparticular, Feferman (1993) has argued that a proof-theoretic analysis\nmay help us establish whether a certain theory complies with a given\nphilosophical framework: for example, the analysis may reveal that a\ntheory is predicative or finitistic etc. Furthermore, as a by-product\nof the proof-theoretic analysis we sometimes obtain simple\nindependence proofs. In fact, we can show that a theory cannot prove a\nspecific principle because adding it to the theory would increase the\ntheory\u2019s proof-theoretic strength. For example, CZF does not prove the\npowerset axiom, as the addition of powerset to CZF gives rise to a\nmuch stronger theory. Proof-theoretic interpretations have also been\nemployed to compare constructive and intuitionistic ZF set theories\namong each others, as well as with their classical counterparts, and\nalso with other foundational systems for constructive mathematics,\nsuch as constructive type theory and explicit mathematics (see\ne.g., Griffor and Rathjen 1994, Tupailo 2003). For a definition\nof the notion of proof-theoretic strength and for surveys on proof\ntheory see, for example, (Rathjen 1999, 2006b). \n\n\nAlthough CZF and IZF are the most widely studied systems, numerous\nother systems for constructive and intuitionistic set theory have been\nconsidered in the literature so far. The proof-theoretic strength of a\nnumber of constructive and intuitionistic set theories has been\nestablished by a variety of tools, like, for example, an extension to\nset theory of the double negation interpretation (originated in\n(Friedman 1973a)), and a variety of other proof-theoretic\ninterpretations, often resulting from a careful combination of\nsemantic and proof theoretic techniques. In many cases the proof\ntheoretic strength of a system has been determined by a chain of\ninterpretations between constructive and classical systems, and by\nusing a variety of tools, from relisability to more \"traditional\"\nproof theoretic techniques, as ordinal analysis (see, for example,\nBeeson 1985; Griffor and Rathjen 1994; Rathjen 2012b). In particular,\nrealisability has turned out to be very useful, due to its\nflexibility. As to the outcomes of these investigations, some of the\nsystems analysed turn out to be as weak as arithmetic, as, for example,\nFriedman\u2019s system B (Friedman 1977); other systems are as strong as\nfull classical ZF, as IZF (Friedman 1973a). There are also systems of\nintermediate strength, as CZF. The strength of the latter theory, in\nfact, equals that of a theory of one inductive definition known as\nID\\(_1\\). The fact that CZF has the same strength as\nID\\(_1\\) is taken to confirm the (generalised) predicativity of the set\ntheory, and to prove that it exceeds the limit of predicativity given \nthe natural numbers, since ID\\(_1\\)\u2019s proof theoretic ordinal is well above \n\\(\\Gamma_0\\).\n\n\nAs a final remark: while the strength of CZF is well below that of \nsecond-order arithmetic, the simple addition of excluded middle to CZF\ngives us (full) ZF. This should be contrasted with IZF, which already\nhas the strength of ZF (Friedman 1973a). The limited \nproof theoretic strength of CZF compared with IZF has often been considered one of \nthe main advantages of constructive over intuitionistic set\ntheory. In a sense, it would seem that CZF makes the most of \nits use of intuitionistic logic, as it characterises a notion of \n(generalised) predicative set which is sufficiently strong for \nthe development of much of constructive mathematics but also \nweak enough to avoid impredicativity.\nInterestingly, when some large set axioms have been added to\nconstructive set theory, a similar pattern has emerged, as the\nstrength of the resulting theory is well below that of the\ncorresponding classical theory.\n",
