    "main_text": "The Classical Chinese Language: What, How, and Why Does It Convey What It Conveys? || Chinese Characters\n1.1 Chinese Characters\nOdd as these three initial questions may appear, all of them have\nbeen asked and answered differently by Western linguists at one time\nor another. To be sure, much sophisticated work has been done over the\npast century, and there is a general consensus on a variety of\nphonetic, syntactic, and semantic matters. But disputes on an equally\nwide range of other issues are just as numerous, with evidence and\narguments being advanced for incompatible theses about the different\ndimensions of the language(s). Many of these issues have implications\nphilosophers should not ignore when engaged in translation and/or\ninterpretation, and perhaps should not ignore even when working\nclosely only in the contemporary Western philosophical tradition.\nEuropean scholars have been fascinated by the Chinese written\nlanguage since the early Jesuit missionaries to China began writing\nabout it in the late 16th century. A little later Andreas\nMuller claimed to have worked out a \u201ckey\u201d for Chinese in\nthe 1670s, which excited the young Leibniz, already keenly interested\nin all things sinological since at least 1668 (Leibniz WoC: 11\n[1668]). At about the same time Jacob Gohl wrote a book arguing that\nthe language had to have been invented all at once (Duyvendak\n1936). John Webb argued instead that Chinese was the primitive\nlanguage of the human race (1669). Leibniz retained his interest in\nthe language as well as all else having to do with China, but fairly\nearly gave up on the possibility of the written language being the\nbasis of the \u201cUniversal Characteristic\u201d he sought as the\nbasis for reasoning throughout his life (Leibniz WoC: 38 [1679]).\n For the next 150 years the study of the Chinese language was\noverwhelmingly in the hands of missionaries, merchants, and diplomats\nto the \u201cMiddle Kingdom\u201d, amateurs all, with several\ninsights into the language mixed with fanciful speculations about its\norigin, nature, and development. Most of these studies had as their\nmajor goal ascertaining the extent to which Chinese philosophical and\nreligious beliefs were or were not compatible with \u201cthe one true\nfaith\u201d in order for conversion work to go forward.\nComing closer to the present, the disputes about the nature of the\nlanguage are very different than in Leibniz\u2019s day, but almost\nequinumerous, beginning with what to call the characters that comprise\nthe written form. Among the candidates nominated for the title\nare lexigraphs, phonograms, phonic\nindicators, phonoideographs, logographs, \nmorphographs, sinographs, syllabograms,\nand syllabo-phonograms (DeFrancis 1984: 73; the list is not\ncomplete).\n For current purposes it is only necessary to note about this\nnomenclature that its terms divide between emphasizing that the graphs\nconvey sounds (phonetics), which are in the majority, and a minority\nsuggesting the graphs function basically as conveyers of ideas, or\nmeanings, i.e., semantics (hereafter the more general terms\n\u201ccharacters\u201d and \u201cgraphs\u201d will continue to be\nemployed interchangeably). Within the general category of the\ncharacters there are smaller groupings, the names for which have been\ncommonly agreed upon for some time. Three of these smaller groupings\nwe must examine briefly.\nThe total number of characters (individual graphs) in the largest\nChinese dictionaries is a little under 50,000, but less than a fifth\nof those are found with any regularity in the classical texts, and\nstill today a working vocabulary of from 5000 to 7000 graphs is\nconsidered sufficient for all but the most advanced reading. A very\nsmall set of these characters are labelled \u201cpictograms\u201d,\nor \u201cpictographs\u201d, being basically stylized pictures of\nwhat they stand for: \u201ctree\u201d is written \u6728, the sun\n\u65e5, and child, \u5b50. These characters are highly\nstylized now. They better represented what they signified before, but\nwere nevertheless conventional even then, as all characters have been\n(see below).\nThe members of a second, still rather small set of characters are\ngenerally called \u201cideographs\u201d, supposedly representing\nmore abstract ideas incapable of being pictured directly. There are\ntwo subsets here. The first comprises fairly simple and direct graphs:\n\u4e00, \u4e8c , and \u4e09 signify 1, 2, and 3 respectively,\nand \u4e0a and \u4e0b are \u201cabove\u201d and\n\u201cbelow\u201d, or \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d. The\nsecond subset involves less simple and direct graphs, but they do have\nmuch illustrative content. Some famous textbook examples of this\ncategory of ideograms are ming, which combines the pictures\nof the sun \u65e5 and moon \u6708together to signify the Chinese\nword for \u201cbright\u201d, \u660e (as with English, it also\nmeans \u201cintelligent\u201d). Here is a paradigmatic example of\nthe conventionality of the characters. The sun and the moon together\ndo suggest light, illumination, etc. But so would a picture of a\ncandle, or two candles; a fire, or two fires. Many pictures might\nrepresent a word, or concept, and consequently, to some extent at\nleast, using sun and moon together for \u201cbright\u201d is\narbitrary, the signified cannot be determined unambiguously from the\nsignifier alone; it must become conventional.\nTogether, pictographs and ideographs make up less than 10% of all\nChinese characters. Among the remaining 90+%, far and away the most\ncommon are generally referred to as phonetic compounds. These\nare made up of at least two elements, one of which is semantic, or\nmeaning-indicative, and are called significs or, more\nmisleadingly, radicals. The other element in compound graphs\nis the phonetic, or sound-indicative component. Thus the word\nfor \u201cspider\u201d in Chinese (zhu) sounds exactly like\nthe word for \u201cdark red\u201d (burgundy, vermilion), so the\ngraph denoting \u201cspider\u201d contains that color word\n(\u6731). But to indicate the reference more clearly in its written\nform, the graph for \u201cinsect\u201d (\u866b) has been added as\na signific, obtaining the phonetic compound graph\n\u86db, zhu.\nPhonetic compounds do not, however, form a neat and tidy\nset.  Dao\u2014probably the most pregnant character in the\nChinese classical lexicon\u2014has two major components, both of\nwhich are significs in themselves, and neither of which is pronounced\nanything like dao, in either their ancient or modern\nsounds.\nSimilarly, the word wu which means \u201clie\u201d,\n\u201cfalsely accuse\u201d, or \u201cmalicious\u201d is and was\npronounced like the word for \u201cwitch\u201d or\n\u201cshaman\u201d, \u5deb, which became the phonetic component of\nthe word when it took on a written form, with \u201cspeech\u201d,\n\u8a00 added as signific. If we now note that witches were not\ntrustworthy in ancient China we end up with a graph signifying\n\u201cwords of a witch\u201d, \u8aa3\u2014but the graph is listed\nas a phonetic compound, not an ideograph. This example can be\ngeneralized: many so-called \u201cphonetic\u201d elements in complex\nChinese characters also have semantic content, and often are even more\nmeaning-indicative than the signific. Using similarly-sounding words\nto generate new meanings for one or more of them is called\n\u201cparonomasia\u201d (Ames 2008), and at times, homonyms or\nnear-homonyms are used to define a word, a technique used in\nChina\u2019s first dictionary the Shuowen jiezi (ca.\n1st century CE).\nIt probably seems odd that the sounds of a language could\nbe of any import in explicating the philosophies of its speakers:\nFrench certainly sounds different than German, but it is highly\ndoubtful the differences are of any philosophical import. The links\nbetween spoken and written Chinese in the past, however, are more\ntenuous than between French or German, contributing to the written\nlanguage developing a grammar that is sui generis, requiring\nsemantic material on a much larger scale than is common in other\nlanguages. And if the grammars of the spoken and written languages\ndiffer, one must be very careful when considering the relation of\nlanguage to thought in ancient (and to some extent modern) China.\nIn the first place, the Chinese language has only about 400\ndistinct sounds (virtually all characters are single\nsyllable). Because it employs tones\u2014from four to eight depending\non the \u201cdialect\u201d\u2014the sounds may be multiplied to\n1600, but this is still a very small number for developing a\nvocabulary, and of course the sounds are not distributed evenly across\nthe characters. Consequently there are a very large number of homonyms\nin Chinese. In a modern 5000+ dictionary, for example, there are 81\ngraphs pronounced yi, 46 of them in the falling tone; 80\ngraphs are pronounced shi, 15 in the even tone. Anciently\nthere were a number of consonantal endings to the sounds that have\nsince disappeared in most dialects, but even then there would be\nanywhere from 3 to 10 or more different graphs\u2014hence with\ndifferent meanings\u2014pronounced in exactly the same way (Karlgren\n1966).\nWhat this means is that the written language often cannot be\nunderstood when read aloud unless the listeners are already familiar\nwith the passage and what this means in turn is that the written\nlanguage should probably not be seen as a transcription of speech\n(Graham 1987: 390; DeFrancis 1984: 126).\nAll languages have this difficulty with homophones, but those with\nan alphabet have recourse in their written forms to disambiguate the\naural homonymy without a context even though the mechanism is not\nconsistently employed (Cooper 1978: 7). Speakers of English are never\nconfused about the meanings, for example, of \u201cbare\u201d and\n\u201cbear\u201d, or \u201cflower\u201d and \u201cflour\u201d.\n\u201cBear\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d however can cause speakers\nof English trouble without a context that gives them the animal and\nnot the \u201ccarry\u201d reading, or vice versa.\nTo complicate the graph/sound relation still further, there are\nsome graphs that have different meanings when pronounced differently.\n\u6a02, for example, means \u201cmusic\u201d when pronounced\nas yue, \u201cjoy\u201d, \u201cpleasant\u201d, or\n\u201cfind pleasure in\u201d when pronounced as yao, and\n\u201cto enjoy\u201d (intransitive) when pronounced\nas le.\n These communicative difficulties could, however, also be seen as a\nblessing in disguise, for they seem to have given Chinese thinkers two\ndistinct linguistic media for communicating their thoughts and\nfeelings: speaking their native tongue, a natural language, and\nwriting classical Chinese using characters, at least a semi-artificial\nlanguage (but one with great beauty and power to affect readers). Thus\nwhat follows \u201cso-and-so said\u201d in any classical text is\nvery rarely a strict transcription of what the speaker actually said;\ninstead, it very probably indicated in brief form what was\nmeant. Adding a syntactic/stylistic note in this context, one\nscholarly wit has said of the classical language\n \n\nIts telegraphic terseness could reflect ordinary speech only if\nevery Chinese speaker were far more laconic than any Gary Cooper\ncharacter. (Hansen 1992: 34)\n Although the grammar of written classical Chinese differs from the\nlanguage spoken then or now, and it is neither systematic nor\ncomplete, one shouldn\u2019t think it was consciously put together by\nsome particularly clever language-oriented members of the Chinese\nintelligentsia at a particular place and time long ago, as Jacob Gohl\ndid (Duyvendak 1936: 6). Rather is it almost surely a development of\nthe oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty (Keightley\n1978). Thus the written and spoken languages evolved differently over\ncenturies.\nThe spoken language, like all others, was undergoing phonetic\nchange much of the time, which the written form could not reflect\nbecause of its non-alphabetic nature; hence the rise of the use of\nphonetic compounds, of which there were already almost 7000 out of the\n9350+ graphs recorded in the Shuowen. Because the written\nform could no longer reflect the sounds of the spoken there was much\nless incentive to attempt reflecting syntax either, especially when it\nis kept in mind that the spoken language was indeed continually\nundergoing change as well, and that to refer to the differences in\nsounds and sound patterns between them as \u201cdialects\u201d\noverlooks the fact that some of the variants were (and are) as\ndifferent from each other as Italian from German. In this sense to say\n\u201cI speak Chinese\u201d is like saying \u201cI speak\nEuropean\u201d. So the two language forms evolved separately for the\nmost part, the spoken, we may surmise, much more rapidly, both within\nand between regional \u201cdialects\u201d.\n Factors such as these are what must have led at least one\nwell-known sinologist to claim that \u201cThe Chinese characters made\nChinese civilization the culture of the book and not the orator\u201d\n(Creel 1997: 447). This generalization was based in large part on the\nbasis of Creel\u2019s earlier work attempting to show the semantic\nbasis of the majority of the characters, i.e., that they were\nbasically ideographs (1936). Peter Boodberg replied quickly and in\ndetail, offering phonetic explanations for graphs Creel had analyzed\nas semantic (1937). The debate continued, not without acrimony, with a\nresponse from Creel (1938), and a rejoinder from Boodberg (1940). More\nrecently John DeFrancis argued long and hard for the phonetic\ninterpretation of the Chinese script (1984), as did William Hannas,\nwho \nrejected the untenable assumption that Chinese\n characters are \u201cideographic\u201d, that is, relate to meaning\n directly without the intervention of language. (1997:\n 6) \n Chad Hansen challenged this phonetic view (1993), arguing for the\nappropriateness of the semantic emphasis of the graphs on a number of\ncounts, not the least of which was that the Chinese themselves took\nthe graphs to be semantically and not phonetically based, and that\nthey used the ideograph rather than the phonogram as the unit of\nclassification of their dictionaries. He was quickly rebuked for\nengaging in \u201cscientific creationism\u201d (Unger 1993: 949; see\nthe pages following Unger for Hansen\u2019s rejoinder).\nIn addition to the problem of ignoring the Chinese scholars\u2019\nview of their own language, the phonetics-based position suffers from\nthe fact that the graphs do not make for an efficient representation\nof the sounds of the spoken languages. Both DeFrancis and Hannas,\ninsistent on the characters as basically representations of sounds,\nnevertheless admit they do the job \u201cpoorly\u201d (DeFrancis\n1984; Hannas 1997: 1).\nEstablishing the precise nature of the relationship between\nphonetic and the semantic elements of classical Chinese is not an easy\ntask; it is closer and more complex than it may seem at first,\nespecially when we take historical context into account. The earliest\nphilosophers conveyed their views orally, not in written form, with\nthe Confucian Analects as a prime example; more than half the\nentries begin, as above, with \u201cThe Master said\u201d, even when\nwhat follows is paraphrase, unless extremely brief. It is of\nimportance, however, that readers of the Analects always keep\nin mind that the Master was engaged in conversation with his\nstudents. There is a dynamism in the text that is difficult to\nappreciate if it is overread.\nFurther, China\u2019s most revered book of poems is also its\noldest (ca. 8th century BCE), and the poems were and are\ncentrally concerned with sounds and sound patterns (and Confucius\ninsisted his students study it). Moreover, far and away the best means\nof memorizing texts or parts of them is by knowing how to pronounce\nthe graphs in sequential order. Indeed, many works in the canon were\nconsciously rhymed at times during their composition to aid\nmemorization as a philosophical exercise (we will have more to say on\nthis theme in \u00a74.2). On the other hand,\nonce you know that \u201cto lie\u201d is depicted as \u201cthe\nwords of a witch\u201d you will likely not forget it. On the one hand\nagain, over 90% of the characters have a phonetic element in them. But\non the other, the Chinese themselves used semantics and not phonetics\nfor the construction of their dictionary classification system, as\nHansen noted.\nThe place of rhetoric in China is also contested. Like Creel,\nanother well-known sinologist could say \u201cWe know of no early\noratorical tradition in China\u201d (Crump 1964: 36), and a\ncommunications scholar maintains that there was no tradition of\nrhetoric in China (Murphy 1983: 3). Others allow that there was, but\nit was not worth much. To them, \u201cChinese rhetoric is\ncharacterized by harmony, deprecation of speech, and lack of interest\nin logic\u201d (Lu and Frank 1993: 445). Contradicting all of these\nlatter generalizations is a lengthy work entitled Rhetoric in\nAncient China, Fifth to Third Century B.C.E. (Lu 1998).\n Clearly the relation of sound to meaning in classical Chinese is\nnot yet established to the satisfaction of all, linguists,\nsinologists, or otherwise. The issues involved, as we are seeing,\nextend far beyond linguistics normally construed to include problems\nin philosophy\u2014Chinese and Western\u2014and politics. In the\nwords of one contemporary scholar:\n  In the scholarly war over the nature of Chinese\nwriting, while the two sides are engaged in earnest battles, the\nChinese scholars are onlookers, whose views are almost completely\nignored. (Gu 2014: 695)\nThere is more to be said about these matters, but first we must\nconsider briefly what links sound and meaning together in any\nlanguage: syntax.\n",
