    "main_text": "Anarchism in Political Philosophy || Absolute, Deontological, and a priori Anarchism\n2.2 Absolute, Deontological, and a priori Anarchism\n\nAnarchists often make categorical claims to the effect that no state\nis legitimate or that there can no such thing as a justifiable\npolitical state. As an absolute or a priori claim, anarchism\nholds that all states always and everywhere are illegitimate and\nunjust. The term \u201ca priori anarchism\u201d is found in\nSimmons 2001; but it is employed already by Kropotkin in his\ninfluential 1910 article on anarchism, where he claims that anarchists\nare not utopians who argue against the state in a priori\nfashion (Kropotkin 1927 [2002: 285]). Despite Kropotkin\u2019s claim,\nsome anarchists do offer a priori arguments against the\nstate. This sort of claim rests upon an account of the justification\nof authority that is usually grounded in some form of deontological\nmoral claim about the importance of individual liberty and a logical\nclaim about the nature of state authority.\n\nOne typical and well-known example of this argument is found in the\nwork of Robert Paul Wolff. Wolff indicates that legitimate authority\nrests upon a claim about the right to command obedience (Wolff 1970).\nCorrelative to this is a duty to obey: one has a duty to obey\nlegitimate authority. As Wolff explains, by appealing to ideas found\nin Kant and Rousseau, the duty to obey is linked to notions about\nautonomy, responsibility, and rationality. But for Wolff and other\nanarchists, the problem is that the state does not have legitimate\nauthority. As Wolff says of the anarchist, \u201che will never view\nthe commands of the state as legitimate, as having a binding moral\nforce\u201d (Wolff 1970: 16). The categorical nature of this claim\nindicates a version of absolute anarchism. If the state\u2019s\ncommands are never legitimate and create no moral duty of obedience,\nthen there can never be a legitimate state. Wolff imagines that there\ncould be a legitimate state grounded in \u201cunanimous direct\ndemocracy\u201d\u2014but he indicates that unanimous direct\ndemocracy would be \u201cso restricted in its application that it\noffers no serious hope of ever being embodied in an actual\nstate\u201d (Wolff 1970: 55). Wolff concludes:\n\n\nIf all men have a continuing obligation to achieve the highest degree\nof autonomy possible, then there would appear to be no state whose\nsubjects have a moral obligation to obey its commands. Hence, the\nconcept of a de jure legitimate state would appear to be vacuous, and\nphilosophical anarchism would seem to be the only reasonable political\nbelief for an enlightened man. (Wolff 1970: 17)\n\n\nAs Wolff puts it here, there appears to be \u201cno state\u201d that\nis legitimate. This claim is stated in absolute and a priori\nfashion, a point made by Reiman in his critique of Wolff (Reiman\n1972). Wolff does not deny, by the way, that there are de facto\nlegitimate states: governments often do have the approval and support\nof the people they govern. But this approval and support is merely\nconventional and not grounded in a moral duty; and approval and\nsupport are manufactured and manipulated by the coercive power and\npropaganda and ideology of the state.\n\nWe noted here that Wolff\u2019s anarchism is connected to Kant. But\nKant is no anarchist: he defended the idea of enlightened republican\ngovernment in which autonomy would be preserved. Rousseau may be\ncloser to espousing anarchism in some of his remarks\u2014although\nthese are far from systematic (see McLaughlin 2007). Some authors view\nRousseau as espousing something close to \u201ca posteriori\nphilosophical anarchism\u201d (see Bertram 2010 [2017])\u2014which\nwe will define in the next section. Among classical political\nphilosophers, we might also consider Locke in connection with\n\u201clibertarian anarchism\u201d (see Varden 2015) or Locke as\noffering a theory \u201con the edge of anarchism\u201d, as Simmons\nhas put it (Simmons 1993). But despite his strong defense of\nindividual rights, the stringent way he describes voluntary consent,\nand his advocacy of revolution, Locke believes that states can be\ndefended based upon the social contract theory.\n\nLeaving the canonical authors of Western political philosophy aside,\nthe most likely place to find deontological and a priori\nanarchism is among the Christian anarchists. Of course, most\nChristians are not anarchists. But those Christians who espouse\nanarchism usually do so with the absolute, deontological, and a\npriori claims of the sort made by Tolstoy, Berdyaev, and\nEllul\u2014as noted above.\n",
