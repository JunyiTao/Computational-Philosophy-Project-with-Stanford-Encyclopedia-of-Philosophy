    "main_text": "A taxonomy || Dispositions and other powers\n1.1 Dispositions and other powers\n\nIt will be helpful to begin by considering a topic that is related to,\nbut nominally distinct from, abilities: dispositions.\n\nDispositions are, at first pass, those properties picked out by\npredicates like \u2018is fragile\u2019 or \u2018is soluble\u2019,\nor alternatively by sentences of the form \u2018x is\ndisposed to break when struck\u2019 or \u2018x is disposed\nto dissolve when placed in water.\u2019\u00a0Dispositions so\nunderstood have figured centrally in the metaphysics and philosophy of\nscience of the last century (Carnap 1936 & 1937, Goodman 1954),\nand also in influential accounts of the mind (Ryle 1949). They are\nlike abilities in many significant respects, in particular in the fact\nthat they are properties of things that can exist even when not\nmanifested: as a glass may be fragile even when it is not broken, so\nmay a person have the ability to raise her arm even when she is not\nraising her arm.\n\nWhile dispositions have been central to contemporary philosophical\ndiscussions, they do not exhaust the range of the possibilities\ninherent in things. Especially notable, for present purposes, are\nthose that are intimately connected to agency. These include the\nsusceptibility of things to be acted on in certain ways \u2014 such\nas the edibility of an apple, or the walkability of a trail \u2014\nthat the psychologist J.J. Gibson called affordances (Gibson, 1979).\nThese include also the powers of action that we ascribe to things, of\nthe kind observed by Thomas Reid: \u2018Thus we say, the wind blows,\nthe sea rages, the sun rises and sets, bodies gravitate and\nmove\u2019 (Reid 1788/2010, 16; Reid himself regarded these locutions\nas \"misapplications\" of active verbs, based on erroneous\nviews of the grounds of powers). Finally, and crucially, these include\nthe powers of agents themselves.\n\nIn light of this ontological diversity, it will be useful to have a\nterm that encompasses all the possibilities inherent in things and in\nagents. Let us reserve the word \u2018power\u2019 for that general\nclass. Dispositions, as defined above, are a proper subset of powers\nmore generally. Affordances, as sketched above, are another one. And\nabilities, in a sense still to be defined, are yet another.\n\nIt may yet be that dispositions are especially privileged among the\npowers. For instance, they might be more fundamental than the other\npowers, in the sense that other powers may be reduced to them. It has\nbeen proposed, for instance, that affordances may be reduced to\ndispositions (Scarantino 2003). And we will consider in some detail,\nin Section 5.1, the proposal that abilities themselves may be reduced\nto dispositions. But our initial hypothesis is that dispositions are\nsimply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has\nreceived a great measure of attention in the philosophical\nliterature.\n",
