Alas, I cannot lose ten pounds by saying that I am doing so, nor\ncan I persuade you of a claim by saying that I am doing so. On the\nother hand I can promise to meet you tomorrow by uttering the words,\n\u201cI promise to meet you tomorrow,\u201d and if I have the\nauthority to do so, I can even appoint you to an office by saying,\n\u201cI hereby appoint you.\u201d (I can also appoint you without\nmaking the force of my act explicit: I might just say, \u201cYou are\nnow Treasurer of the Corporation.\u201d) Only an appropriate\nauthority, speaking at the appropriate time and place, can: christen a\nship, pronounce a couple married, appoint someone to an administrative\npost, declare the proceedings open, or rescind an offer. Austin,\nin How To Do Things With Words, details the conditions that\nmust be met for a given speech act to be\nperformed felicitously.\n\nFailures of felicity fall into two classes: misfires\nand abuses. The former are cases in which the putative speech\nact fails to be performed at all. If I utter, before the QEII,\n\u201cI declare this ship the Noam Chomsky,\u201d I have not\nsucceeded in naming anything because I lack the authority to do\nso. My act thus misfires in that I\u2019ve performed an act of speech but\nno speech act. Other attempts at speech acts might misfire because\ntheir addressee fails to respond with an appropriate uptake:\nI cannot bet you $100 on who will win the election unless you accept\nthat bet. If you do not accept that bet, then I have tried to bet but\nhave not succeeded in betting. As we will see in Section 9, a\nsystematic unwillingness on the part of a speaker\u2019s interlocutors to\nrespond with the requisite uptake may compromise that speaker\u2019s\nfreedom of speech.\n\nSome speech acts can be performed\u2013that is, not\nmisfire\u2014while still being less than felicitous. I promise to\nmeet you for lunch tomorrow, but haven\u2019t the least intention of making\ngood. Here I have promised all right, but the act is not felicitous\nbecause it is not sincere. My act is, more precisely,\nan abuse because although it is a speech act, it fails to\nlive up to a standard appropriate for speech acts of its\nkind. Sincerity is a paradigm condition for the felicity of speech\nacts. Austin foresaw a program of research in which thousands of types\nof speech act would be studied in detail, with felicity conditions\nelucidated for each.[8]\n\nAs observed by Sbis\u00e0 2007, not only can I perform a speech act\nby speaker meaning that I am doing so, I can also\nsubsequently rescind that act. I cannot, it would seem,\nchange the past, and so nothing I can do on Wednesday can change the\nfact that I made a promise or assertion on Monday. However, on\nWednesday I may be able to retract a claim I made on\nMonday. I can\u2019t take back a punch or a burp; the most I can do is\napologize for one of these infractions, and perhaps make amends. By\ncontrast, not only can I apologize or make amends for a claim I now\nregret; I can also withdraw it. Likewise, you may allow me on\nWednesday to retract the promise I made to you on Monday. In both\nthese cases of assertion and promise, I am now no longer beholden to\nthe commitments that the speech acts engender in spite of the fact\nthat the past is fixed. Just as one can, under appropriate conditions,\nperform a speech act by speaker meaning that one is doing so, so too\none can, under the right conditions, retract that very speech act.\n",
