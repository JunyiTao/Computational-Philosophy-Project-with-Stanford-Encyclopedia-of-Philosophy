    "main_text": "The Long Reach of Microbiome Research || Causality issues\n6. Why Microbes and Microbiology Warrant Philosophical Attention\n\nPhilosophy of microbes and microbiology goes beyond both its\norganismal and scientific bases. As discussed above, whether microbes\nare used as models or as sources of data about biogeochemistry, their\nimplications go much further. They constitute many of the material\naspects of human lives, from individual bodies to every process in the\nbiosphere. Although there are many ways in which general lessons are\ntaken from large organisms, broad swathes of biology depend on\nmicrobes in numerous ways, and this influences how researchers\nunderstand and theorize about organisms such as humans. For\nphilosophers of biology interested primarily in human or other animal\nbiology, there will always be some sort of philosophical payoff if\nmicrobiological angles are included.  Philosophers of science more\ngenerally may find that understanding models or experimentation\ncarried out with living systems can be enhanced by attention to\nmicrobial modelling practices.\n\nEven for philosophers who are not philosophers of science,\nmicrobiology can be brought to bear on issues such as identity,\nselfhood, human nature, and mind, to generate broader insights and\nsurprising conclusions. Not all such conclusions are defensible, but\nexamining the ways in which microbes might contribute to humanness\ncould be a valuable exercise. Consider why, for example, trillions of\nmicrobes living inside human bodies seem more easily regarded as part\nof that body, whereas the handful of helminths that do likewise are\nusually (but not always) distinguished as separate and ideally\nevicted. Microbes also offer philosophers tractable ways to study big\nquestions about the nature of life, causation, and representation in\ngeneral. For example, microbial experimental systems may be\nseen as material equivalents of the mental structures philosophers\nmanipulate in thought experiments. There is also something to\nlearn about the ways microbial and other modelling activities differ.\n",
