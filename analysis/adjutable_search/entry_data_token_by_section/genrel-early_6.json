    "main_text": "Kantian and Neo-Kantian Interpretations || Neo-Kantians on Special Relativity\n3.1 Neo-Kantians on Special Relativity\n\nIn the universities of Imperial and early Weimar Germany, the\nphilosophy of Kant, particularly the various neo-Kantian schools, held\npride of place. Of these, the Marburg School of Hermann Cohen and Paul\nNatorp, including Cohen\u2019s student Ernst Cassirer, exhibited a\nspecial interest in the philosophy of the physical sciences and of\nmathematics. Yet prior to the general theory of relativity\n(1915\u20131916), Kantian philosophers accorded relativity theory\nonly cursory attention. This may be seen in two leading Marburg works\nappearing in 1910, Cassirer\u2019s Substanzbegriff und\nFunktionsbegriff and Natorp\u2019s Die Logischen Grundlagen\nder Exakten Wissenschaften. Both books conform to the\ncharacteristic Marburg modification that greatly extended the scope of\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Logic, bringing under \u201cpure\nthought\u201d or \u201cintellectual forms\u201d what Kant had\nsharply separated in a distinction between the purely passive faculty\nof sensibility and the active faculties of understanding and reason.\nOf course, this revisionist tendency greatly transforms the meaning of\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic and with it Kant\u2019s\nconviction that space and time were forms of sensibility or pure\nintuitions a priori and so as well, his accounts of\narithmetic and geometry. As will be seen, it enabled Cassirer, some\nten years later, to view even the general theory of relativity as a\nstriking confirmation of the fundamental tenets of transcendental\nidealism. In 1910, however, Cassirer\u2019s brief but diffuse\ndiscussion of \u201cthe problem of relativity\u201d mentions neither\nthe principle of relativity nor the light postulate nor the names of\nEinstein, Lorentz or Minkowski. Rather it centers on the question of\nwhether space and time are aggregates of sense impressions or\n\u201cindependent intellectual (gedankliche) forms\u201d.\nHaving decided in favor of the latter, Cassirer goes on to argue how\nand why these ideal mathematical presuppositions are necessarily\nrelated to measurable, empirical notions of space, time, and motion\n(1910: 228\u20139 [1923: 172\u20133]).\n\nNatorp\u2019s treatment, though scarcely six pages is more detailed\n(1910: 399\u2013404). In revisionist fashion, the \u201cMinkowski\n(sic) principle of relativity\u201d was welcomed as a more\nconsistent (as avoiding Newtonian absolutism) carrying through of the\ndistinction between transcendentally ideal, purely mathematical,\nconcepts of space and time and the relative physical measures\nof space and time. The relativization of time measurements, in\nparticular, showed that Kant, once shorn of the psychologistic error\nof pure intuition, correctly maintained that time is not an object of\nperception. Natorp further alleged that from this relativization it\nfollowed that events are ordered, not in relation to an absolute time,\nbut only as lawfully determined phenomena in mutual temporal relation\nto one another, a version of Leibnizian relationism. Similarly, the\nlight postulate had a two-fold significance within the Marburg\nconception of natural science. On the one hand, the uniformity of the\nvelocity of light, deemed an empirical presupposition of all\nspace- and time-measurements, reminded that absolute determinations of\nthese measures, unattainable in empirical natural science, would\nrequire a correspondingly absolute bound. Furthermore, as an upper\nlimiting velocity for physical processes, including gravitational\nforce, the light postulate eliminated the \u201cmysterious\nabsolutism\u201d of Newtonian action-at-a-distance. Natorp regarded\nthe requirement of invariance of laws of nature with respect to the\nLorentz transformations as \u201cperhaps the most important result of\nMinkowski\u2019s investigation\u201d. However, little more is said\nabout this, and there is some confusion regarding these\ntransformations and the Galilean ones they supersede; the former are\nseen as a\n\n\nbroadening (Erweiterung) of the old supposition of the\ninvariance of Newtonian mechanics for a translatory or\ncircular (zirkul\u00e4re, emphasis added) motion of\nthe world coordinates. (1910: 403)\n\n\nHe concluded with an observation that the appearance of non-Euclidean\nand multi-dimensional geometries in physics and mathematics are to be\nunderstood only as \u201cvaluable tools in the treatment of special\nproblems\u201d. In themselves, they furnish no new insight into the\n(transcendental) logical meaning and ground of the transcendental and\npurely mathematically determined concepts of space and time;\nstill less do they require the abandonment of these concepts.\n",
