    "main_text": "Theories of Experience || Perceptual Content\n1.3 Perceptual Content\n\nLet us now turn to more fine-grained connections between contents of\nexperience and perceptual justification, focusing on contents of\nexperience that can be assessed for truth.\n1.3.1 Necessity of Content\n\nFirst, is having specifically the content that \\(p\\)\nnecessary for an experience to justify believing that \\(p\\)?\nHere is a first pass at capturing the issue:\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link4\n\nIf your visual experience \\(e\\) gives you justification\nto believe some external world proposition that \\(p\\),\nthen \\(e\\) has the content that \\(p\\).\n\nA challenge comes from cases when you use an experience and background\nbeliefs to extrapolate far beyond any content the experience might\nhave. For example, when I have an experience in New York with the\ncontent that the traffic light is red, my background beliefs enable\nthe experience to justify me in believing that cars might still be\npermitted to turn right. But this legally informed belief is in a\ncontent that most likely does not figure in my experience.\n\nTo accommodate extrapolation beyond experience thanks to auxiliary\nbeliefs, the simplest response is to focus on non-inferential\njustification that does not involve auxiliary beliefs.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link5\n\nIf your visual experience \\(e\\) gives you\nnon-inferential justification to believe some external world\nproposition that \\(p\\), then \\(e\\) has\nthe content that \\(p\\).\n\nIf Link5 is true, it allows for rich connections between theories of\nperceptual experience and theories of perceptual justification.\nConsider for instance the debate about \u201chigh-level\u201d\ncontent. Very roughly, this debate is about whether our experiences\nmerely represent colors, shapes and locations, or whether they\nrepresent thicker properties or relations such as causing an\nexplosion, being a fake Louis Vuitton bag, being virtuous, or being\nglad to see you (for more see the entry on\n the contents of perception).\n If Link5 is true, and we have non-inferential justification for\nbelief in high-level contents, it will follow that some of our\nexperiences have high-level contents as well. But how to establish\nthat our experiences give us non-inferential justification for some\nhigh-level beliefs?\n\nOne route is to try to leverage the psychological immediacy of our\nformation of some high-level beliefs. When the fashionista sees the\ndroopy bag marked \u201cLouis Vuitton\u201d in a cheap Shenzhen\nmall, she does not need to pull out her lighter to test whether the\nmaterial melts likes plastic. Instead she forms her belief that the\nbag is a fake Louis Vuitton without any conscious reflection.\nLikewise, we don\u2019t need to puzzle out whether our loved ones are\npresent when we see them\u2014we seem to recognize them on the basis\nof our experiences without reasoning. Still, it may be that auxiliary\nbeliefs are playing a role in all these examples while remaining\nunconscious. The psychological immediacy of belief formation\nneedn\u2019t go along with non-inferential justification (see\nMcDowell 1982).\n\nFor further discussion of how to show we have non-inferential\njustification from experiences for some beliefs in high-level\ncontents, and of whether the experiences themselves would need to have\nhigh-level contents to do so, see Millar 2000, McDowell 2009, or\nSilins 2013.\n\nFor further defense of the claim that an experience justifies a belief\nonly if it has a content identical with that of the belief, see\nMcDowell 1994 and Brewer 1999. For critical responses, see Speaks 2005\nand Byrne 2005.\n1.3.2 Sufficiency of Content\n\nIs having the content that \\(p\\) enough for an\nexperience to justifying you believing that \\(p\\)? Here\nis a first pass at capturing the idea:\n\nSufficiency First Pass\n\nIf you have an experience \\(e\\) with the content that\n\\(p\\), then \\(e\\) gives you\njustification to believe that \\(p\\).\n\nThe Sufficiency thesis is not formulated in terms of non-inferential\njustification. For all it says, whenever an experience justifies a\nbelief, it does so only in a way involving the assistance of an\nauxiliary belief. Still, the picture does mesh well with views on\nwhich experiences give non-inferential justification, and we may\nunderstand it in those terms in what follows.\n\nOur thesis does need to be qualified. For example, suppose that you\ngain convincing evidence that you are the victim of an illusion, as\nwhen you learn that the lines of the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion are the\nsame in length even though they look to be different in length:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. M\u00fcller-Lyer\n illusion[1]\n\n\nYour experience does not give you justification to believe that the\nlines are different in length once you have gain the evidence they are\nthe same in length. Such cases are ones of \u201cdefeat\u201d, where\nfurther evidence opposes or otherwise disrupts your receipt of\njustification from your experience (some cases may be like someone\nwriting over the graffiti drawn by experience, other cases may be like\nsomeone erasing the graffiti drawn by experience, and perhaps there\nare further variants of defeat as well). To take account of such\ncases, the fan of Sufficiency can say that\n\nSufficiency\n\nIf you have an experience \\(e\\) with the content that\n\\(p\\), then \\(e\\) gives you defeasible\njustification to believe that \\(p\\).\n\nHere the core idea is that your experience gives you justification\nunless you have gained evidence that your experience is\nmisleading.\n\nFor defenses of theses along the lines of Sufficiency, see Pollock\n(1974), Pryor (2000) or Huemer (2001, 2007). Their strategies put much\nweight on what it is like to have an experience (see more in\n section 2.4\n on this sort of strategy). A different approach tries to exploit the\nway that experiences come to have their contents, for example by\narguing that experiences are likely to have true or accurate contents\ngiven the way they come to have their contents. For examples of this\nstrategy, see Burge 2003, Peacocke 2004, Sawyer and Majors 2005, and\nSetiya 2012: ch. 3.\n\nThe Sufficiency thesis also promises to establish rich connections\nbetween epistemology and the philosophy of mind. Consider again the\ndebate about high-level contents of experience. If one is able to\nestablish that experiences have high-level contents, one could then\nuse the Sufficiency thesis to reach the conclusion that experiences\njustify beliefs in high-level contents as well.\n\nAssuming that experiences with the content that \\(p\\)\nwill give non-inferential justification for a belief that \\(p\\),\nwe could then have an answer to an important\nquestion for foundationalist views in epistemology. These are views on\nwhich our inferentially justified beliefs about the external world are\ninferred from a foundation of non-inferentially justified beliefs (for\nmore see the entry on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification).\n Which beliefs get to be in the foundation? This question for\nfoundationalist views is pressing. As Nozick remarks, it is of little\nuse to have a foundation for our knowledge that is only one brick wide\n(1981: 3). In general, the more restrictive foundationalist views are\nabout the breadth of our foundational beliefs, the harder it will be\nto build up to everyday beliefs about the world. However, if beliefs\nconcerning causation, emotions, or morality get to be foundational,\nthe foundationalist project can look much more promising (Masrour\n2011).\n\nAs helpful as the Sufficiency thesis could be for foundationalists, it\nfaces much criticism. Many objections proceed by proposing\nrequirements for justification that are not always satisfied when one\nhas an experience with a given content. For example, one might demand\nthat the experience be a case of seeing\n (section 2.2 of this entry),\n or demand that the experience be suitably free of top-down influence\nfrom one\u2019s own mind\n (section 2.4 of this entry).\n (For further objections, see McGrath 2017 or Chudnoff 2018).\n\nHere we will focus on objections that turn on the character of\nperceptual content. The objection here is known as \u201cthe problem\nof the speckled hen\u201d (see Chisholm 1942; Sosa in Sosa and\nBonjour 2003; Markie 2009 for different versions of the problem).\n\nTo get a feel for our problem, suppose you get a look at a speckled\nhen in good light, but without enough time to carefully count the\nnumber of speckles on it.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. \u201cSpeckled Sussex Hen\nnamed Mata\n Hari\u201d[2]\n\n\nThe objection to Sufficiency can be put as follows. First, your\nexperience does have a verdict about how many spots face you\u2014say\nto the effect that \\(H\\) has 17 spots. Second, your\nexperience does not justify you in believing that \\(H\\)\nhas 17 spots. After all, forming a belief that \\(H\\)\nhas 17 spots without carefully counting might manifestly seem no more\nlikely to be right than a guess. So, the critic concludes, some\nexperiences have the content that \\(p\\) without giving\nyou justification to believe that \\(p\\).\n\nIn response, some argue that your experience is actually silent about\nthe exact number of speckles facing you on the hen (see Tye 2009; for\nmore on experience and numeracy, see Beck 2012).\n\nOne can raise the core challenge to Sufficiency in other ways. Another\nsource of examples can be found in Block\u2019s (2007) empirically\ninformed work on \u201cphenomenal overflow\u201d (drawing on\nSperling 1960 and Lamme 2003). Consider for example the Sperling\nparadigm, in which subjects are flashed a grid of letters, and only\nsubsequently given a tone that indicates which row to report (high for\nthe top, medium for the middle, etc). Subjects are able to report any\nrow singled out without being able to report them all. (For an online\ndemo without sound, see\n Other Internet Resources).\n Arguably subjects experience all the letters as they are without\nbeing able to report them all (but see Stazicker 2011 or Phillips 2011\nfor criticisms of Block, also Odegaard et al 2018). The objector may\nadd that we do not have justification from our experience to believe\nthe proposition that enumerates all the letters present. (For a\nfurther way to set up the speckled hen problem, using the example of\nhighly determinate colors, see Smithies 2019: ch. 11).\n\nEven if one allows that some experiences have enough determinacy to\nset up the speckled hen problem, the option remains of maintaining\nthat the experiences do give you justification to believe the relevant\ndeterminate proposition. For example, perhaps your experiences do give\nyou justification to believe the determinate proposition, even though\nyou are unable to take advantage of the justification you have by\nforming a belief on their basis (see Smithies 2012a for a view with\nthis structure).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps speckled hen cases are compatible with\nSufficiency since they turn out to be cases of defeat. Given that we\nare generally aware of our poor ability to make snap judgments about\nthe details of the scene before, perhaps we have defeasible but\ndefeated justification to believe detailed propositions about the\nscene before us.\n1.3.3 Intentionalism\n\nSo far we have focused on the ramifications for epistemology of the\nview that experiences have propositional contents. Intentionalism is a\nmore ambitious view in the philosophy of mind that aims to find\nnecessary connections between the conscious character of an\nexperience\u2014what it is like to have it\u2014and the content of\nthat experience. According to intentionalists, at a minimum,\n\nMinimal Intentionalism\n\nIf experiences \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) have the same content, then what it\nis like to have \\(e_1\\) is the same as what it is like to have\n\\(e_2\\).\n\nIn a slogan, \u201csame content, same character\u201d (for\ndiscussion of further variations in the camp, see Chalmers 2004). On\nthis picture, if two experiences present the same testimony about the\nworld, there is no room for any difference in what it is like to have\nthose experiences. Whether there is such a tight link between content\nand conscious character is controversial, consider the frequently\ndiscussed possibility that your shifting attention could vary the\nconscious character of two distinct experiences without varying their\ntestimony about the world.\n\nHere we will point to some epistemological ramifications of the\nview.\n\nOne way to defend Intentionalism examines how we become\nintrospectively aware of what it\u2019s like to have our experiences.\nArguably we become introspectively aware of what it\u2019s like to\nhave our experiences only by being aware of what we are experiencing.\nPerhaps awareness of the world is the sole route to introspective\nawareness of what it\u2019s like to have a given experience. And\nperhaps this point about introspection supports at least a minimal\nversion of Intentionalism. For further discussion of this broadly\nepistemological argument for intentionalism, see the entry on\n qualia\n (section 6), also the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness\n (section 3.3).\n\nAnother defense of Intentionalism examines how we become able to think\nabout certain properties by having experiences. Perhaps experiences\nare sufficient for certain cognitive abilities, and perhaps\nIntentionalism gives the best explanation of how experiences are\nsufficient for certain cognitive abilities. For an exposition of this\nbroadly epistemological line of argument for Intentionalism, see Pautz\n2010.\n\nFor an epistemological argument against some versions of\nIntentionalism, see Kriegel 2011. He targets versions of the view that\naim to find what constitutes experience in terms of awareness of\nproperties (or a suitably similar relation to properties). According\nto Kriegel, just as sense-data theories are unable to provide an\nadequate epistemology because of the \u201cveil of appearances\u201d\nthey impose between perceivers and the world, the targeted versions of\nIntentionalism fail to provide an adequate epistemology for the same\nreason. As we saw in\n section 2.1,\n sense-data theorists have ways to respond to veil objections. Perhaps\nintentionalists do as well.\n",
