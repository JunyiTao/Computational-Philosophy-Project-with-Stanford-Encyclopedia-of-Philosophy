    "main_text": "Reasons for Introducing Impossible Worlds\n1. Reasons for Introducing Impossible Worlds\n\nWhy might one believe in impossible worlds? One argument is the\nso-called \u201cargument from ways\u201d (Vander Laan 1997), which\nis related to the first definition of impossible world given above.\nThis draws on the analogy with\n David Lewis\u2019s\n notorious argument concerning our quantifying over ways things could\nhave been (see Lewis 1973: 84). The world could have been different in\nso many ways: Hilary Clinton could have won the 2016 US election, I\ncould be dancing on the ceiling, and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem could\nhave remained without proof. Our belief in possible worlds is just a\nparaphrase of our belief that there are many ways the world could have\nbeen.\n\nAren\u2019t there also ways the world could not have been?\nSome authors endorse the claim that anything is possible\n(e.g. Mortensen 1989). However, the majority of philosophers believe\nthat not everything is possible, in the sense that some things just\ncan\u2019t happen. If I tell you that my college has a\ncupola which is both fully round and fully square, you are likely to\nreply, \u201cit can\u2019t be that way!\u201d. So it seems\nthat \u201c\u2018ways\u2019 talk goes both ways\u201d (Beall and\nvan Fraassen 2003: 86). If quantification on ways the world could have\nbeen should be taken at face value as providing evidence for possible\nworlds, then quantification on ways the world could not have been\nshould be taken at face value as providing evidence for impossible\nworlds.\n\nThe argument as such is hardly convincing. Firstly, one author\u2019s\nmodus ponens is another\u2019s modus tollens. Some\nhave used similar considerations to argue against Lewis\u2019s modal\nrealism (see Skyrms 1976; Naylor 1986): if one believes in possible\nworlds (of the Lewisian kind) as ways things could have been, then by\nparity of reasoning one should believe in impossible worlds (ditto) as\nways things could not have been. But impossible worlds are too much to\nswallow, so (by modus tollens) one should not believe in\nLewis\u2019s modal realism.\n\nSecondly, taking quantification over any kind of entity whatsoever at\nface value, just because it is embedded in ordinary language,\ndoesn\u2019t look like a promising general strategy. Lewis\u2019s\ncase for accepting commitment to possible worlds did not consist just\nin an argument from ways. He also provided independent\nmotivation for taking quantification over possible worlds at face\nvalue. A non-reductive account of possible worlds, according to Lewis,\nbrings net theoretical utility. The ontological cost is compensated by\na theoretical gain, given the variety of ontological, semantic, and\nconceptual explanations allowed by our taking the notion of possible\nworld seriously. This is likely to be the main motivation for\nbelieving in impossible worlds. As we will see below, defenders of\nimpossible worlds claim that they are are theoretically useful.\n\nAnother argument on behalf of impossible worlds, quite pervasive in\nthe literature, comes from counterpossible reasoning (e.g.\nBeall and van Fraassen 2003, Chapter 4; Nolan 1997; Restall 1997;\nBrogaard and Salerno 2013). This is reasoning from suppositions,\nassumptions, or conditional antecedents which are not only false, but\nimpossible. We can reason non-trivially from impossible suppositions,\nby asking what would be the case, were (say) the Law of\nExcluded Middle false. To say that we reason non-trivially\nfrom an assumption means just that we accept some conclusions but\nreject others on the basis of that assumption. If we hypothetically\nsuppose the Law of Excluded Middle to be false, for example, then we\nwould likely conclude that intuitionistic logic would be preferable to\nclassical logic, given that supposition. We are unlikely to conclude\nthat classical logic would be a satisfactory logic, or that scarlet\nwould be a shade of green, given that supposition. The point readily\ngeneralizes to reasoning about entire theories and to serious\nphilosophical and logical debates. We often reason from suppositions\nabout the truth of certain logical, mathematical, or metaphysical\ntheories which, if in fact false, are necessarily false, because of\nthe very nature of their subject matter.\n\nThis kind of reasoning is related to our assessment of certain\nconditional statements with impossible antecedents, often called\ncounterpossible conditionals or, more simply,\ncounterpossibles. These include:\n\n(1.1)  If Hobbes had\nsquared the circle, then mathematicians would have been\namazed.\n\nLet\u2019s call a conditional like this trivially true when\nit is true and the conditional with the same antecedent and opposite\n(negated) consequent is also true. (1.1)\u200b\u200b is intuitively\ntrue, and yet\n\n(1.2)  If Hobbes had\nsquared the circle, then mathematicians would not have been\namazed.\n\nis intuitively false. If that\u2019s correct, then there are\nnon-trivially true counterpossibles. These considerations impact on\nour preferred semantics for such conditionals, for the possible worlds\nsemantics for conditionals has trouble accommodating this position.\nYet the analysis in terms of worlds does a good job for conditionals\nwith possible antecedents. This motivates a semantics for\ncounterpossibles in terms of impossible (as well as possible) worlds.\nWe will get into more detail in\n section 2.5.\n\nThese kinds of argument highlight the usefulness of impossible worlds\nas devices for analyzing particular linguistic, logical, and\nphilosophical issues. The point can be expanded into the general\n\u201cargument from utility\u201d mentioned above: we should believe\nin impossible worlds because they are useful tools for logicians and\nphilosophers. Whether that general argument is acceptable depends on\nhow persuasive the specific impossible worlds analyses are.\nLet\u2019s look at some.\n",
