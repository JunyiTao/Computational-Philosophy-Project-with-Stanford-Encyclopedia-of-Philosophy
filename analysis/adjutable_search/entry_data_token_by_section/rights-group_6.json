    "main_text": "Fears of the implications or consequences of group rights\n7. Fears of the implications or consequences of group rights\n\nWorries about the moral implications or consequences of ascribing\nrights to groups relate not only to whether we should accept that\ngroups have rights but also to how generously we should ascribe rights\nto them. The common thread running through these worries is the threat\nthat group rights might pose to individuals and their rights.\nSometimes the concern is for those inside, and sometimes for those\noutside, the right-holding group.\n\nOne concern is that, if we give moral standing to groups as such, we\nshall lose sight of individuals within the group (Vincent 1989, 714).\nIf a group can have standing as a group independently of its\nindividual members, those individuals will have no standing on any\nmatter on which the relevant standing lies with the group. On those\nmatters, the separate wills of individuals cannot count. They will not\nbe overridden; they will simply pass unrecognised. \n\nAnother fear concerns the power that a group may wield over its own\nmembers (e.g. Macdonald 1989; Offe 1998, 131\u20135; Waldron 1993,\n363\u20136). When we allow that a group has rights, those may be\nrights that enable it to regiment the lives of its members. Thus, once\nagain, group rights may function to the detriment of those who fall\nwithin the group. In one respect, that seems an unnecessarily\ninvidious way of representing the relationship between groups and\ntheir members. There is nothing unusual about a group\u2019s organising\nitself so that it can make decisions collectively, either directly or\nthrough appointees, that bind its members severally. That describes\nthe normal state of affairs for tennis clubs, anglers\u2019 associations,\npolitical parties, churches and any number of quite unremarkable\ngroups. The right of a group collectively to make decisions that bind\nits members severally is a simple description of democracy.\n\nSo why has there been so much angst about allowing that groups can\nhave rights over their members? The answer is that, in recent decades,\ngroup rights have been discussed primarily in relation to groups that\nhave involuntary memberships: groups that are distinguished by their\nrace, ethnicity, culture, or language. People do not choose to be\nmembers of these \u201cascriptive\u201d groups, nor can they easily\nleave them as they might leave a club or association. If they find the\ngroup\u2019s authority oppressive or its way of life intolerable, they\ncannot simply opt out, since their membership of the group is treated\nby others\u2014insiders or outsiders or both\u2014as a natural\n\u201cgiven\u201d to which normal rights of entry and exit do not\napply. That is why Will Kymlicka, for example, a liberal deeply\nsympathetic to the claims of cultural groups and indigenous peoples,\nis reluctant to allow that the rights of groups can be directed\ninwardly as restrictions upon the group\u2019s own members, rather than\noutwardly as protections against the external world (Kymlicka 1995,\n34-48; cf. Marmor 2001).\n\nConcerns about the potential for oppression implicit in group rights\nsometimes have an empirical dimension. Demands for group rights are\noften looked upon most favourably when they are made by indigenous\npeoples, cultural minorities and religious groups whose way of life is\nthreatened by external influences. But frequently, it is alleged, the\nreal effect of conceding rights to these sorts of group is to\nreinforce the power of conservative elites whose wishes and interests\nclash with those of others in the group. Typically, an elite will want\nto use its power to maintain the traditions and integrity of the group\nand will be unwilling to tolerate dissent, deviance and demands for\nreform. It will also seek to maintain the position of those within the\ngroup who have traditionally been subordinate. This issue is often\ndescribed as the problem of \u201cminorities within minorities\u201d\n(Eisenberg and Spinner-Halev 2005; Green 1994), but it can also be a\nproblem of majorities (e.g. women) within minorities. In short, while\naccording rights to a group may enhance the position of some of its\nmembers, it may seriously diminish the freedom and well-being of\nothers (Cohen et al. 1999; Deveaux 2000; Dick 2011; Kukathas 1992,\n113-15; Okin 2002; Shachar 2001; Tamir 1999, 158-64, 173-4). We should\nalso bear in mind, however, that withholding power from a sub-state\ngroup for that reason involves the assumption that the group\u2019s members\nwill be better served by the state\u2019s authority than by the authority\nof their group, an assumption that some would question (e.g. Holder\n2012).\n\nA closely related fear concerns the potential of group rights to rival\nand override the rights of individuals (e.g. Buchanan 1994; Caste\n1992; Graff 1994; Isaac 1992; Macdonald 1989, 126\u20137; Tamir 1999,\n161; Tes\u00f3n 1998, 132\u2013137). One of the strongest\nmotivations for ascribing rights to individual persons is to provide\nthem with safeguards. Individuals as individuals are vulnerable to\nthose who wield power in all of its many forms and to the might of\nnumbers. When we give rights to individuals, we provide them with\nmoral shields that protect them from the excesses of power, including\nexcesses of collective power. But, if we ascribe rights to groups, we\nmay discover that their rights override the rights of individuals, so\nthat rights lose their potency as safeguards for individuals. When the\nrights of a mighty group come up against those of a mere individual,\nGoliath rather than David may more frequently emerge as the\nvictor.\n\nThat concern is shared by List and Pettit (2011, 170\u201385). While\nthey hold that group agents as group persons should possess rights,\nthey also subscribe to value (or \u201cnormative\u201d)\nindividualism, the view that something is good only if it is good for\nindividual human beings or non-human sentient beings (182). On their\nview, value-individualism provides reason not to abandon group rights\n(as Hartney, 1991, alleges) but to curtail the scope of those rights.\nGroup persons should have only rights that will redound to the benefit\nof individual persons, be they members or non-members of the group.\nGiven the well-known dangers posed by asymmetries of power between\ngroups and individuals, we should accord groups a more limited set of\nrights than we accord individuals, though we have no reason similarly\nto curtail the responsibilities we assign groups. (For other views on\nvalue-individualism and the curtailing of group rights, see Hindriks\n2014; Pasternak 2017; Rafanelli 2017; Smith 2018).\n\nGroup rights conceived collectively may seem less threatening to\nindividuals than group rights conceived corporately. Because, on the\ncorporate conception, a group has moral standing independently of its\nmembers, its standing, will and interest can rival and override those\nof its individual members. A collective right by contrast, because it\nis held jointly by the individuals who make up the collectivity and is\ngrounded in their standing and interests, presents no similar danger.\nBut fear of collective rights may still be provoked by the way in\nwhich those rights derive from the aggregation of individual\ninterests. As we have already seen, on Raz\u2019s conception of collective\nrights, numbers count. Numbers affect both whether groups have rights\nand how weighty their rights are (1986, 187, 209). Others are loath to\naccept that rights can derive from, or be affected by, that sort of\naggregation (R\u00e9aume 1988, 2003; Tamir 1999, 166\u201371). In\ncontemporary philosophy, rights-thinking is commonly opposed to\nmaximizing consequentialism, of which utilitarianism is the prime\nexample. Ascribing rights to individuals is a way of acknowledging\ntheir separateness as persons and of safeguarding them from the\naggregative excesses of utilitarianism. But if the aggregation of\ninterests can yield collective rights, a morality of rights may begin\nto assume the character of, and to present the same dangers as, the\nvery sort of utilitarian thinking that many rights-theorists intend it\nto preclude, especially for those outside the right-holding group.\n",
