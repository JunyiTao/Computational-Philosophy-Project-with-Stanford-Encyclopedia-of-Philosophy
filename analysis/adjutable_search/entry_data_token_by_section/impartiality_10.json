    "main_text": "Moral impartiality II: Deontological moral theories || Contractualist models of deontological impartiality\n4.4 Contractualist models of deontological impartiality \n\nParfit\u2019s \u201cKantian Contractualist Formula,\u201d mentioned\nin the previous section, adheres to the contractualist approach to\nmoral theorizing, which gives expression to two insights fundamental\nto Kantian thinking: that morality is objective, and not simply a\nmatter of personal opinion or expression of interest and desire; and\nthat from the standpoint of morality, each person matters just as much\nas, and no more than, any other person. Contractualism borrows from\nthe social contract tradition the idea that morality may be viewed as\nthe result of an agreement between those who are to be bound by its\ndictates. Two variants of this approach can be distinguished. The\nformer, sometimes referred to as contractarianism, identifies\nthe participants in the bargaining process with actual individuals,\nand thus is broadly historical. The latter approach, by contrast,\nappeals to what agents would choose under various, quite\npossibly unrealizable conditions, and is thus hypothetical\nrather than historical. It is the latter approach that will concern us\nhere.\n\nThe hypothetical contractualist model, then, regards moral principles\nas the result of a bargaining process among a group of agents, subject\nto certain restrictions that are specified so as to guarantee that the\nchosen principles will meet the demands of second-order impartiality.\nThe most famous example of this approach is John Rawls\u2019\n\u2018veil of ignorance\u2019, as described in (Rawls 1971).\nAccording to Rawls, the principles of a just society are those that\nwould be chosen by self-interested rational agents in the\n\u2018original position\u2019 \u2013 a position in which agents\npossess broad knowledge about human history and the nature of the\nworld they live in, but are denied specific information regarding\ntheir own particular identities or prospects in the society in\nquestion, the nature of that society, and, crucially, the nature of\ntheir own particular conception of the good. Since nobody knows who\nthey will be or what social position they will occupy, there is no\nopportunity for anyone in an advantaged position to take advantage of\nthat position in order to force a less privileged party to concede to\nan otherwise unacceptable outcome. It is this fact that allows Rawls\nto claim that principles chosen under the veil of ignorance are\nguaranteed to be impartially acceptable to all \u2013 and thus,\nguaranteed not to be unjust.\n\nIt should be noted that Rawls does not intend that morality in its\nentirely be derived from the original position. Rather, the function\nof the original position is limited to the choice of the most general\nprinciples of social justice in a well-ordered society (Rawls 1971,\nsection 2; 2001, section 12). Nevertheless, Rawls\u2019 mechanism is\nintended to draw the broad outlines of what many see as the most\nimportant part of morality: its public or political aspect. By viewing\npolitical morality as the result of an agreement between contractors\nlimited by the strictures of the veil of ignorance, Rawls intends to\ndevelop a political philosophy that reflects his commitment to the\nidea of liberal neutrality: the idea, that is, that each person has a\nprivate right to her own conception of the good, and that particular\nconceptions of the good therefore ought not to be legislatively\ninstituted, nor legislated against.\n\nAn especially difficult task attending a project of this sort is that\nof determining what shape this political morality will take \u2013\nthat is, determining which principles would be chosen by agents in the\noriginal position. On Rawls\u2019 account, the contractors settle on\nprinciples that guaranteed as much liberty as possible for all and,\nwithin the limits set by this guarantee, a roughly egalitarian\ndistribution of goods in which inequalities are allowed only if they\nare to the benefit of the worst off (Rawls 1971, section 11; 2001,\nPart II). The claim that such principles would recognize all persons\nas equals \u2013 and thus, their claim to reflect the demands of\nmoral impartiality \u2013 is supported by several considerations, of\nwhich three are perhaps most significant: first, that all persons are\nguaranteed equal (and substantial) civil liberties; second, that the\nresulting allocation of resources is broadly egalitarian, and in\nparticular, ensures, so far as is possible, that the fundamental needs\nof all persons are met; and third, that since the only inequalities\nthat are permitted are those that would benefit the least advantaged,\nit can presumably be assumed that the least advantaged would give\ntheir assent to the existence of such inequalities (they would not,\neven if they could, veto the system.)\n\nIn Rawls\u2019 scheme, the function of the veil of ignorance is\nnecessary to prevent rational self-interested persons from using their\nknowledge of their own positions to win unfair advantages over others.\n(Whether such an approach can provide genuine impartiality between\ncompeting conceptions of the good is a difficult question that will be\nfurther considered in section 5.) An alternative approach abandons\nboth the veil of ignorance and the assumption that the bargaining\nparties are primarily self-interested. This is the strategy favored by\nT.M. Scanlon, whose contractors are motivated not by self-interest but\nby \u2018the desire for reasonable agreement\u2019 (Scanlon 1982,\n115 n. 10; see also Scanlon 1978, 1998; Barry 1995). On the resulting\naccount of moral permissibility, \u201can act is wrong if its\nperformance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any system\nof rules for the general regulation of behavior which no one could\nreasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced general\nagreement\u201d (Scanlon, 1982, 110). The requirement of impartiality\nis captured here by the basic fact that the question is whether\neveryone who is to live under the selected rules can\nreasonably accept them. As in Rawls\u2019 theory, however, the\nprinciples of second-order impartiality accepted at the contract level\nallow for considerable first-order partiality at the level of\nagent-choice. Somewhat similarly, Gert (1998) argues for a list of\nmoral rules which \u201call impartial rational persons would favor\nincluding [\u2026] as part of the moral system\u201d (158).\n\nSince interpretations of impartiality, what it requires, and how it\nconnects with other moral concepts can vary considerably,\ncontractualist theories that recognize impartiality as a core element\ncan nevertheless vary widely in terms of what they requires of agents.\nHarsanyi (1977) argues that a version of utilitarianism can be\ndefended on the basis of an \u201cequiprobability model,\u201d\naccording to which an agent ought to choose between social systems\n\u201cunder the assumption that, in either system, he would have the\nsame probability of occupying any one of the available social\npositions\u201d (Harsanyi 1982, 45; cf. Hare 1981). Gauthier (1986)\nalso views his theory as meeting the demands of impartiality, even\nwhile explicitly denying that a substantial notion of equality plays a\nmajor role: \u201cEquality is not a fundamental concern in our\ntheory. In arguing that social institutions and practices are\njustified by appeal to a hypothetical ex ante agreement among\nfully informed rational persons, we have appealed to the equal\nrationality of the bargainers to show that their agreement satisfies\nthe moral standard of impartiality. But impartial practices respect\npersons as they are, the inequalities among them as well as the\nequalities\u201d (270). Obviously, such a combination of claims is\nnot uncontroversial; while it is clear that a notion of impartiality\ncan be defined that respects existing inequalities as well as\nequalities, it will not be immediately obvious to everyone why such a\nnotion ought to have deep moral significance or to be reflected in our\nmoral practices.\n",
