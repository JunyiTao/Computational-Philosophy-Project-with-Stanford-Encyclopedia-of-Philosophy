    "main_text": "Ontological Commitment in Ordinary Language || Overview\n4.1 Overview\nIf a quantifier account of ontological commitment is to be applied\ndirectly to ordinary language, we need to know which ordinary language\nquantifiers or uses of quantifiers (if any) are ontologically\ncommitting. The same goes for entailment and truthmaker accounts,\nnotwithstanding our relaxed attitude in applying the accounts to\nordinary language examples. For on both accounts ontological\ncommitment depends on the entailment of existentially quantified\nsentences, and we need to know whether the quantifiers of the entailed\nsentences carry ontological commitment.\nQuine's considered view was that his criterion of ontological\ncommitment cannot be applied to theories couched in ordinary\nlanguage.  Before applying the criterion, the theory must be\nparaphrased into first-order predicate logic (without names); and\nthen, strictly speaking, it is only the first-order theory that\ncarries ontological commitment, not the ordinary language theory.\n[37] \n(The proponent of the theory can be convicted of holding the\nontological commitment if\u2014and only if\u2014she accepts the\nparaphrase.) For Quine, this view reflected his general approach to\nordinary language and ontology: the speakers of ordinary language,\ntypically, are not ontologically serious; it is the task of\nphilosophers, not ordinary folk, to determine which prima\nfacie commitments are genuine. There were also specific reasons\nwhy a direct application of his criterion to ordinary language might\nlead to erroneous results. For one thing, theories couched in ordinary\nlanguage containing non-extensional constructions might have\nontological commitments not revealed by quantificational structure (see \u00a71.7.3). For another thing, quantification\nin ordinary language might fail to carry ontological commitment if it\nis not objectual, not amenable to the standard Tarskian\nmodel-theoretic semantics\n (see \u00a71.6.2). Only the quantifiers\n of first-order logic, Quine\nheld, are guaranteed to be objectual (because we stipulate their\nsemantics); and only objectual quantification carries ontological\ncommitment.[38]\nOn closer inspection, however, Quine is in no position to claim\nthat theories couched in ordinary language never carry\nontological commitment. In giving the truth conditions for the\nquantifiers of first-order logic, Quine explicitly makes use of\nordinary language quantifiers (see, for example, Quine 1970). Thus,\nhis claim that the first-order quantifiers are objectual, and carry\nontological commitment, can't help but carry over to the ordinary\nlanguage quantifiers from which they derive their meaning. There\nmust, then, be some portion of ordinary language that can do all the\nwork, vis-\u00e0-vis ontological commitment, that the first-order language\nwas introduced to \ndo.[39] \nThis doesn't eliminate the need to seek\nparaphrases of ordinary language theories\n(see \u00a74.2 below). But such theories\nneed not be paraphrased into the language of first-order predicate\nlogic; it is enough if they are paraphrased into that regimented\nportion of ordinary language that can be counted on, in appropriate\ncontexts, to be ontologically serious. The problem that needs to be\naddressed by the Quinean is then: how to recognize which quantifiers,\nor which uses of quantifiers, make up this ontologically serious\nportion of ordinary language. Those who reject the Quinean approach\nto ontological commitment, on the other hand, need to argue that\nthere is no principled way to separate out those quantifiers, or uses\nof quantifiers, that carry ontological commitment in ordinary\nlanguage; or, more radically, that quantification in ordinary\nlanguage is never ontologically committing.\nThere is a wide spectrum of views on whether ordinary language\nquantification is ontologically committing. On one end of the\nspectrum is the view that all ordinary assertive uses of the\nquantifiers \u2018there is\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019 are\nontologically committing, a view that may be dubbed\n\u201callism\u201d (see Lewis 1990,\nand \u00a71.6.4 above). On this view,\ndiscovering the ontological commitments of ordinary speakers is\neasy. In asserting that \u201csome prime numbers are greater than\n100\u201d, we commit ourselves to the existence of numbers; in\nasserting that \u201cthere are properties that all great leaders\nhave in common\u201d, we commit ourselves to the existence of\nproperties. Ontological commitment cannot be avoided by paraphrasing\nthese sentences into the ontologically serious portion of our\nlanguage because these ordinary assertions are already ontologically\nserious.[40]\nHofweber (2005) agrees that quantification in ordinary language is\nsometimes ontologically committing, but not always, and not when we\nquantify over abstract entities, such as numbers and properties, in\nordinary (i.e., non-philosophical) contexts. Hofweber claims that\nthere are two distinct readings of ordinary language quantifiers,\nreadings that make different contributions to truth conditions and\nperform different communicative functions. One reading, which he calls\nthe \u201cdomain conditions reading\u201d, is tied to ontology: it\nplaces conditions on what exists in reality.  If I say\n\u201csomething fell on my head\u201d (in a standard context), I am\nthereby committed to the existence of an object meeting the condition\n\u201cfell on my head\u201d. But, Hofweber argues, there is another\nreading of ordinary language quantifiers that is not tied to ontology,\nwhat he calls the \u201cinferential role reading\u201d. On this\nreading, the inference from F(t)\nto F(something) is trivially valid, even in cases\nwhere we do not take the term t to refer to anything in\nreality. On this reading, I can infer \u201cthere is someone whom I\nadmire\u201d from \u201cI admire Sherlock Holmes\u201d without my\nquantified assertion conveying any ontological commitment.\nYablo (1998) holds that the distinction between quantified\nstatements that are ontologically committing and those that are\nnot\u2014if it can be made out at all\u2014will rest not on\ndifferent readings of the quantifiers, but on the distinction between\nliteral and figurative uses of language. Indeed, all parties agree\nthat figurative language can fail to be ontologically committing; one\ncan assert, truly, that she has butterflies in her stomach without\nthereby being committed to the existence of butterflies. But\nfigurative language is very widespread, even in the sciences. A case\ncan be made, for example, that ordinary talk of numbers is merely a\npretense we engage in to more easily communicate facts about the\nconcrete world; and similarly for talk of other abstract entities. The\nproject of applying ontological commitment to ordinary language\ntheories, then, is none too easy: it depends upon being able to\ndemarcate language that is literal from language that is partly\nfigurative; and it depends on there being a stripped-down core of\nordinary language that, when interpreted literally, has the\nrepresentational capacity for fully describing the world.\nOn the far end of the spectrum is the view that ordinary language\nquantifiers, by themselves, are never ontologically committing. A\nCarnapian might hold this view as a consequence of her general view\nthat ontological commitment, in a metaphysically loaded sense of the\nterm, is incoherent (see \u00a75.1). A Meinongian\nmight hold this view on the grounds that it is only the existence\npredicate, not the quantifier, that conveys ontological\ncommitment. The Meinongian, however, is in a weak position when she\nclaims that quantification over non-existent objects fails to be\nontologically committing (see \u00a71.6.3); for\nnon-existent objects don't differ from existent objects in their\ninstantiation of properties, or their having natures independent of\nour theorizing. Azzouni (2004), like the Meinongian, takes the\nexistence predicate to be what conveys ontological commitment; but,\nunlike the Meinongian, he denies that our talk of non-existent objects\nrequires that they have any sort of independent being. The\ntie between ontology and quantification is completely severed. All\nquantification\u2014like Hofweber's \u201cinference role\u201d\nreading of the quantifier\u2014is ontologically neutral.\nHow do the various views along this spectrum impact the Quinean\nproject of using paraphrase to provide substitutes for ordinary\nlanguage theories that can be evaluated for ontological commitment?\nFor Quine, as already noted, there is no presumption that ordinary\nlanguage quantification is ontologically serious.  But it is crucial\nto Quine's project that some portion of ordinary language can be used\nfor ontologically serious discourse, and that when so used,\nquantification holds the key to ontological commitment. The allist\nview, although compatible with the Quinean project, will lead to\nattributions of ontological commitment wildly different from Quine's\nown. It makes ontological commitment hard to avoid, leading to\noverpopulated ontological slums; the desert landscape favored by Quine\nwill be hard to come by.  Hofweber's view is more congenial to the\nQuinean project, so long as the \u201cdomain conditions\u201d\nreading of the quantifiers can be stipulated to be in effect. That can\nbe done, Quine seems to presuppose, merely by taking an appropriately\nserious attitude to the discourse in question. Inside the philosophy\nroom\u2014or, better, the ontology room\u2014that attitude is\npervasive. Outside the philosophy room, the philosopher is no less\nfree than other speakers to engage in ontologically frivolous\ndiscourse (see Quine 1960: 210). Yablo's view would be congenial to\nthe Quinean project if it were possible to make out the line between\nliteral and figurative discourse: Quine's ontologically serious\ndiscourse could then be identified with thoroughly literal discourse,\nassertively uttered. But Yablo is skeptical that any such project can\nsucceed, and sees that as dooming the Quinean approach to\nontology. Azzouni's view, of course, is outright incompatible with the\nQuinean project. It leads towards a substantially different account of\nontological commitment in which quantification plays no role (see\nAzzouni 2004: ch. 4).\n",
