    "main_text": "Contrastive Underdetermination, Empirical Equivalents, and Unconceived Alternatives || Contrastive Underdetermination: Back to Duhem\n3.1 Contrastive Underdetermination: Back to Duhem\n\nAlthough it is also a form of underdetermination, what we described in\nSection 1 above as contrastive underdetermination raises fundamentally\ndifferent issues from the holist variety considered in Section 2 (Bonk\n2008 raises many of these issues). John Stuart Mill articulated the\nchallenge of contrastive underdetermination with impressive clarity in\nA System of Logic, where he writes:\n\nMost thinkers of any degree of sobriety allow, that an hypothesis...is\nnot to be received as probably true because it accounts for all the\nknown phenomena, since this is a condition sometimes fulfilled\ntolerably well by two conflicting hypotheses...while there are\nprobably a thousand more which are equally possible, but which, for\nwant of anything analogous in our experience, our minds are unfitted\nto conceive. ([1867] 1900, 328)\n\n\nThis same concern is also evident in Duhem\u2019s original writings\nconcerning so-called crucial experiments, where he seeks to show that\neven when we explicitly suspend any concerns about holist\nunderdetermination, the contrastive variety remains an obstacle to our\ndiscovery of truth in theoretical science:\n\nBut let us admit for a moment that in each of these systems\n[concerning the nature of light] everything is compelled to be\nnecessary by strict logic, except a single hypothesis; consequently,\nlet us admit that the facts, in condemning one of the two systems,\ncondemn once and for all the single doubtful assumption it contains.\nDoes it follow that we can find in the \u2018crucial\nexperiment\u2019 an irrefutable procedure for transforming one of the\ntwo hypotheses before us into a demonstrated truth? Between two\ncontradictory theorems of geometry there is no room for a third\njudgment; if one is false, the other is necessarily true. Do two\nhypotheses in physics ever constitute such a strict dilemma? Shall we\never dare to assert that no other hypothesis is imaginable? Light may\nbe a swarm of projectiles, or it may be a vibratory motion whose waves\nare propagated in a medium; is it forbidden to be anything else at\nall? ([1914] 1954, 189)\n\n\nContrastive underdetermination is so-called because it questions the\nability of the evidence to confirm any given hypothesis against\nalternatives, and the central focus of discussion in this\nconnection (equally often regarded as \u201cthe\u201d problem of\nunderdetermination) concerns the character of the supposed\nalternatives. Of course the two problems are not entirely\ndisconnected, because it is open to us to consider alternative\npossible modifications of the web of beliefs as alternative theories\nbetween which the empirical evidence alone is powerless to decide. But\nwe have already seen that one need not think of the\nalternative responses to recalcitrant experience as competing\ntheoretical alternatives to appreciate the character of the\nholist\u2019s challenge, and we will see that one need not embrace\nany version of holism about confirmation to appreciate the quite\ndistinct problem that the available evidence might support more than\none theoretical alternative. It is perhaps most useful here to think\nof holist underdetermination as starting from a particular theory or\nbody of beliefs and claiming that our revision of those beliefs in\nresponse to new evidence may be underdetermined, while contrastive\nunderdetermination instead starts from a given body of evidence and\nclaims that more than one theory may be well-supported by that\nevidence. Part of what has contributed to the conflation of these two\nproblems is the holist presuppositions of those who originally made\nthem famous. After all, on Quine\u2019s view, we simply revise the\nweb of belief in response to recalcitrant experience, and so the\nsuggestion that there are multiple possible revisions of the web\navailable in response to any particular evidential finding just\nis the claim that there are in fact many different\n\u201ctheories\u201d (i.e. candidate webs of belief) that are\nequally well-supported by any given body of\n data.[6]\n But if we give up such extreme holist views of evidence, meaning,\nand/or confirmation, the two problems take on very different\nidentities, with very different considerations in favor of taking them\nseriously, very different consequences, and very different candidate\nsolutions. Notice, for instance, that even if we somehow knew that no\nother hypothesis on a given subject was well-confirmed by a given body\nof data, that would not tell us where to place the blame or which of\nour beliefs to give up if the remaining hypothesis in conjunction with\nothers subsequently resulted in a failed empirical prediction. And as\nDuhem suggests in the passage cited above, even if we supposed that we\nsomehow knew exactly which of our hypotheses to blame in response to a\nfailed empirical prediction, this would not help us to decide whether\nor not there are other hypotheses available that are also\nwell-confirmed by the data we actually have.\n\nOne way to see why not is to consider an analogy that champions of\ncontrastive underdetermination have sometimes used to support their\ncase. If we consider any finite group of data points, an elementary\nproof reveals that there are an infinite number of distinct\nmathematical functions describing different curves that will pass\nthrough all of them. As we add further data to our initial set we will\neliminate functions describing curves which no longer capture all of\nthe data points in the new, larger set, but no matter how much data we\naccumulate, there will always be an infinite number of functions\nremaining that define curves including all the data points in\nthe new set and which would therefore seem to be equally well\nsupported by the empirical evidence. No finite amount of data\nwill ever be able to narrow the possibilities down to just a\nsingle function or indeed, any finite number of candidate functions,\nfrom which the distribution of data points we have might have been\ngenerated. Each new data point we gather eliminates an infinite number\nof curves that previously fit all the data (so the problem\nhere is not the holist\u2019s challenge that we do not know which\nbeliefs to give up in response to failed predictions or disconfirming\nevidence), but also leaves an infinite number still in contention.\n",
