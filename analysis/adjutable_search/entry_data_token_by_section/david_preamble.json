    "main_text": "\n\n\n\u2018David\u2019 is named in certain manuscripts of three works of\nphilosophy as their author: a set of introductory lectures on\nphilosophy, a commentary on Porphyry\u2019s Introduction, and a\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Categories that nowadays is\nattributed to Elias. The name is commonly taken, on the basis of\nevidence internal to these works, to refer to a Christian Neoplatonic\nphilosopher and commentator who presumably worked in Alexandria in the\nmiddle or the second half of the 6th century, or even later. This\n\u2018David\u2019 is also commonly identified with David the\nInvincible, an important figure in the early history of Armenian\nphilosophy, but biographical identifications of this kind are\nextremely precarious.\n\n",
