    "main_text": "Feminist Ethics: Historical Background || Twentieth-Century Influences and Issues\n1.3 Twentieth-Century Influences and Issues\n\nLike Wells-Barnett, anarchist and socialist writers, some from\nworking-class backgrounds, advanced frank arguments for differently\nunderstanding women\u2019s capacities and desires as sexual beings\nwith their own moral agency. Leaders included Emma Goldman, whose\nanarchism was developed as a response to Marx and Marxism (Fiala\n2018). Goldman argued for broader understandings of love, sexuality,\nand family, because she believed that traditional social codes of\nmorality resulted in the corruption of women\u2019s sexual\nself-understanding (112). Like Wells-Barnett, Goldman coupled\narguments against feminine sexual purity with attention to the sexual\nexploitation of, and trafficking in, women who did not enjoy the\nstate\u2019s protection (Goldman 2012). Some suffragists\u2019\n\u201cemphasis on female morality repulsed Goldman. Yet, while she\nridiculed the claim that women were morally superior to men \u2026\nshe also emphasized that women should be allowed and encouraged to\nexpress freely their \u2018true\u2019 femininity\u201d (Marso 2010,\n76).\n\nAlthough early twentieth-century protofeminists differed in their\nbeliefs as to whether men and women were morally different in\ncharacter, they generally shared a belief in Progressive ideals of\nmoral and social improvement if only humankind brought fair and\nrational thinking to bear on ethical issues. Progressive-era\npragmatists, including Wells-Barnett, Charlotte Perkins-Gilman, Jane\nAddams, and Alice Paul, \u201csaw the social environment as\nmalleable, capable of improvement through human action and philosophic\nthought\u201d (Whipps and Lake 2016). The beginning of the century\nwas characterized by remarkably optimistic thinking even on the part\nof more radical theorists who appreciated the deep harms of oppressive\nsocial organizations. Most of the Progressive activists and\nsuffragists of this era never described themselves with the new term,\n\u201cfeminist,\u201d but as the immediate forerunners of feminism,\nthey are described as feminists today.\n\nAlthough belief in the possibilities for change seems widely shared,\nProgressive-era feminists did not always share common ground regarding\nwomen\u2019s moral natures or how to achieve moral progress as a\nnation. For example, both Goldman and pro-suffrage Charlotte\nPerkins-Gilman argued for individual self-transformation and\nself-understanding as keys to women\u2019s better moral characters\n(Goldman 2012), while maintaining that a person\u2019s efforts were\nbest supported by a less individualistic and more communitarian social\nand political framework (Gilman 1966). While Goldman included greater\naccess to birth control and reproductive choice among the morally\nurgent routes to women\u2019s individual self-discovery, Gilman and\nmany feminists argued for women\u2019s access to contraception in\nways that reflected increasingly popular policies of eugenics in North\nand South America and Europe (Gilman 1932). Eugenics-friendly white\nwomen\u2019s contributions of feminist ethical arguments to disrupt\noppressive pronatalism or to avert the measurable costs of parenthood\nin sexist societies often took the form of deepening other forms of\nmarginalization, including those based on race, disability, and class\n(Lamp and Cleigh 2011).\n\nIn the U.S., the centrality of sex and gender issues in public ethics\nreached a high-water mark during the Progressive Era, moving one\nmagazine to write in 1914 that \u201cThe time has come to define\nfeminism; it is no longer possible to ignore it\u201d (Cott 1987,\n13). Unfortunately, this sentiment would decline with the start of\nWorld War I and the consequent demise of optimistic beliefs in the\npowers of human rationality to bring about moral progress. Yet\nthroughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, as economic difficulties,\nmilitary conflicts, and wealth disparity fluctuated internationally,\nwomen\u2019s groups and feminist activists in many countries would\nadvance, with some success, feminist and moral arguments for\nworkplace, professional, electoral, and educational access, for the\nliberalization of contraception, marriage, and divorce laws, and\nagainst militarism. Some of their gains in greater access to voting,\neducation, and prosperity may have contributed to the wide audience\nthat was receptive to Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s publications in\nEurope and, after translations were available, in North America.\n\nBeauvoir first self-identified as a feminist in 1972 (Schwarzer 1984,\n32), and consistently refused the label of a philosopher despite\nhaving taught courses in philosophy (Card 2003, 9). Yet beginning in\nthe 1950s, both her Ethics of Ambiguity ([1947] 1976) and\nThe Second Sex ([1949] 2010) were widely read and quickly\nappreciated as important to feminist ethics (Card 2003, 1). As works\nof existentialist morality, they emphasized that we are not all simply\nsubjects and individual choosers but also objects shaped by the forces\nof oppression (Andrew 2003, 37). Like the protofeminists described\nabove, Beauvoir focused on the embodied experiences and social\nsituations of women. In these pivotal works, she advanced the case\nthat embodiment and social situatedness are not only relevant to human\nexistence, but are the stuff of human existence, so crucial that\nphilosophy ought not ignore them (Andrew 2003, 34). In The Second\nSex, she argued that some men in philosophy managed the bad-faith\nproject of both ignoring their own sex-situatedness and yet describing\nwomen as the Other and men as the Self. Because men in philosophy take\nthemselves to be paradigmatically human and take it upon themselves to\ncharacterize the nature of womankind as different from men, Beauvoir\nsaid that men socially construct woman as the Other. Famously,\nBeauvoir said, \u201cone is not born, but rather becomes,\nwoman,\u201d that is, one may be born a human female, but \u201cthe\nfigure that the human female takes on in society,\u201d that of a\n\u201cwoman,\u201d results from \u201cthe mediation of another\n[that] can constitute an individual as an Other\u201d (Beauvoir\n[1949] 2010, 329). The embodied human female may be a subject of her\nown experiences and perceptions, but \u201cbeing a woman would mean\nbeing an object, the Other\u201d (83), that is, the objectified\nrecipient of the speculations and perceptions of men. Beauvoir\ndescribed a woman who would transcend this situation \u201cas\nhesitating between the role of object, of Other that is proposed to\nher, and her claim for freedom\u201d (84), that is, her freedom to\nassert her own subjectivity, to make her own choices as to who she is,\nespecially when she is not defined in relation to men. A woman\u2019s\nposition is therefore so deeply ambiguous\u2014one of navigating\n\u201ca human condition as defined in its relation with the\nOther\u201d (196)\u2014that if one is to philosophize about women,\n\u201cit is indispensable to understand the economic and social\nstructure\u201d in which women aim to be authentic or ethical,\nnecessitating \u201can existential point of view, taking into account\nher total situation\u201d (84). In other words, philosophers\nspeculating about women ought to take into account the obstacles to\nwomen\u2019s opportunities for subjecthood and choice that are\ncreated by those who constructed an oppressive situation for women to\nnavigate.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s positions\u2014that woman has been defined\nby men and in men\u2019s terms, that ethical theory must attend to\nwomen\u2019s social situation and their capacity to be moral\ndecision-makers, and that women\u2019s oppression impedes their\nknowing themselves and changing their situation\u2014reflect the\nconcerns of many forerunners of feminist ethics. Beauvoir\u2019s work\nprofoundly shaped the emergence of feminist ethics as a subfield of\nphilosophy at a time when philosophers more generally had moved away\nfrom the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tendencies to describe\nwomen as lacking morally worthy rational capacities. Instead, by the\nmiddle of the twentieth century, some influential philosophers in\nEurope and the Americas had moved toward approaches that often led to\ndescribing both gender and ethics as irrelevant to philosophical\ndiscourse (Garry 2017).\n",
