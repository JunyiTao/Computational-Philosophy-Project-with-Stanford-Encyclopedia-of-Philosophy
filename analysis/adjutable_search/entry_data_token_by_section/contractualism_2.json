    "main_text": "How does contractualism differ from utilitarianism?\n3. How does contractualism differ from utilitarianism?\n\nContractualism is an impartial moral theory. In contemporary moral\nphilosophy, the main impartial moral theory outside the social\ncontract tradition is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes\npersons\u2019 moral status to be grounded on their capacity for\nwell-being and suffering, and takes well-being to be the sole moral\nvalue. It takes the appropriate response to this value to be to\npromote it. Utilitarianism is thus a consequentialist moral\ntheory\u2014morality is concerned with bringing about valuable\noutcomes.\n\nThere are three fundamental contrasts between contractualism and\nutilitarianism. The first difference is one of scope. (1)\nUtilitarianism applies to every area of morality, while contractualism\ncovers only the realm of what we owe to one another. Scanlon himself\nacknowledges that this is not the whole of morality. We return to this\ndifference in sections\n 12\n and\n 13.\n\nThe remaining two differences between contractualism and\nutilitarianism relate to content. (2) Contractualism does not\naggregate, but rather focuses on the standpoint of individual\npersons. (3) Contractualism does not regard well-being as a basic\nmoral concept, but instead allows a variety of personal reasons.\n\nThe only reasons for and against a principle that count when we are\njudging whether or not it can be reasonably rejected are\n\u201cvarious individuals\u2019 reasons for objecting to that\nprinciple and alternatives to it\u201d (Scanlon 1998, p. 229). The\nacceptability of a principle depends on a one-by-one assessment of the\nstrength of the reasons that individuals would have for rejecting the\nprinciple, compared to the alternatives to it. Since individuals must\nbe objecting on their own behalf and not on behalf of a group, this\nrestriction to single individuals\u2019 reasons bars the\ninterpersonal aggregation of complaints; it does not allow a number of\nlesser complaints to outweigh one person\u2019s weightier\ncomplaint.\n\nUnlike utilitarianism, therefore, contractualism rejects the\ninterpersonal aggregation of burdens. (We discuss some important\nexceptions below.) This is one of the main respects in which it\ndiffers from utilitarianism. Contractualism thus captures a key\nfeature of our moral life that, as Rawls famously argues,\nutilitarianism ignores: the feature he calls \u201cthe separateness\nof persons\u201d (Rawls 1971). Instead of lumping everyone together\nand allowing one person\u2019s rights to be trampled to provide\ngreater aggregate benefits to others, contractualism recognises that\neach of us has a unique life to live. Contractualism therefore seeks\nprinciples that benefit each person individually and that command each\nperson\u2019s free assent.\n\nAggregation (in some form) is essential to utilitarianism. Situations\nfrequently arise where one person\u2019s pleasure is in conflict with\nanother\u2019s, or where the only way to secure one person\u2019s\npleasure is to cause someone else pain, or where we must choose which\nperson suffers which pain. We must find a way to balance the moral\nreasons generated by different people\u2019s pleasures and pains. If\nwe retain a utilitarian perspective, then it is hard to see how we can\ndo this without some kind of aggregation\u2014adding different\npleasures and pains together.\n\nBy contrast, contractualism seems able to avoid aggregation, because\nit begins, not with individual pleasure and pain, but with the more\nflexible concept of reasons. Unlike my pleasures and pains, my reasons\ncan be responsive to the situation of others. To see this, we explore\ntwo features of Scanlon\u2019s use of reasons: rejection must be\nreasonable, and reasons are not limited to well-being.\n",
