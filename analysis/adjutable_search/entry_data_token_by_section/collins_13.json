Collins and Religion\n\nEdward and Lillian Bloom note in their introduction to A Discourse\nConcerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing that: \n\n\nFor several years and in such works as Priestcraft in\nPerfection (1710) and A Discourse of Free-Thinking\n(1713), he was a flailing polemicist against the entire Anglican\nhierarchy. Not until 1724 did he become a polished debater, when he\ninitiated a controversy that made \u201ca very great noise\u201d and\nwhich ended only with his death. The loudest shot in the persistent\nbarrage was sounded by Grounds and Reasons and its last\nfusillade by the Discourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in\nWriting. (Collins 1729 [1970: iii])\n\n\nIn Priestcraft in Perfection, 1710, and An Historical and\nCritical Essay on the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of\nEngland, 1724, Collins attacks the first clause of Article 20 of\nthe 39 articles: \u201cThe Church hath power to decree rites or\nceremonies, and authority in controversies of faith\u201d. Collins\ngoes over the history of the clause in considerable detail to argue\nthat it is a forgery. Clearly if this were a forgery, the church would\nhave no power to decree rites nor authority in controversies of faith.\nThe point is that: \n\n\n\u2026the just and true establishment of religion lies, in allowing\nevery man to have a conscience of his own; to use and follow his own\nprivate judgment; and particularly, to understand, profess and\npractice, what he thinks God teaches in the holy scriptures. (Collins,\nPreface to the Essay, quoted in O\u2019Higgins 1970:\n143\u20134) \n\n\nO\u2019Higgins notes that this might be the position of any\ndissenting minister. He gives a detailed summary of the controversy in\nChapter IX of his study of Collins.\n\nIn A Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian\nReligion, 1724, Collins attacks the basis of Christianity as a\nrevealed religion. In The Reasonableness of Christianity,\nLocke had made the messiahship of Christ the single fundamental tenet\nfor being a Christian. In the Discourse Collins rejects it.\nThe argument is that Christianity is founded on Judaism, or the New\nTestament on the Old. The New Testament is only of importance in this\nregard insofar as it shows that the prophecies of the Old are\nfulfilled. Collins rejects the claim that they are fulfilled in the\nNew Testament. This, he asserts, is the only proof for Christianity.\nCollins\u2019 critics disputed this claim; there was the proof from\nmiracles. But Collins rejected such proofs.\n\nIn rejecting the argument from prophecies Collins is once again\njousting with the Newtonians. William Whiston (1667\u20131752) was a\nclose associate of Newton\u2019s and was probably influenced by\nNewton\u2019s interest in prophetic arguments. Stephen Snobelen\npoints out in his review of the controversy that Whiston hoped to set\nup an exact science of prophecies. As Snobelen notes: \u201cFor\nWhiston, fulfilled prophecy was as certain as a Boylean experiment or\na Newtonian demonstration\u201d (Snobelen 1996: 205). Collins shared\nmuch of Whiston\u2019s desire for precision. Often it was allowed\nthat a prophecy in the Old Testament had dual fulfillments, one in the\nprophet\u2019s own day and one in the more remote future. One of\nthese was supposed to be literal, the other allegorical. Both Whiston\nand Collins reject \u2018allegorical\u2019 interpretations for\nliteral ones. But while Whiston regarded the later fulfillment as\nliteral and the earlier as allegorical, Collins insisted that it was\nthe earlier one that should be regarded as literal.\n\nUsing the catalog of Collins\u2019 library produced by Giovanni\nTarantino, Jacopo Agnesina has persuasively argued that A\nDiscourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing published in\n1729 is a genuine work of Anthony Collins, though O\u2019Higgins in\nhis biography of Collins doubted its authenticity (Agnesina 2009).\nEdward and Lillian Bloom in their introduction to their reprint of the\nDiscourse remark that:\n\n\nFor the modern reader, the Discourse concerning Ridicule and\nIrony is the most satisfying of Collins\u2019s many pamphlets\nand books. It lacks the pretentiousness of the Scheme, the\nsnide convolutions of the Grounds and Reasons, the argument\nby half-truths of the Discourse of Free-Thinking. His last\nwork is free of the curious ambivalence which marked so many of his\nearlier pieces, a visible uncertainty that made him fear repression\nand yet court it. On the contrary, his last work is in fact a\njustification of his rhetorical mode and religious beliefs; it is an\napologia pro vita sua written with all the intensity and\ndecisiveness that such a justification demands. (Collins 1729 [1970:\nxv])\n\n\nThe aim of the Discourse is to refute a claim by Nathanael\nMarshall that while serious arguments about religious issues should be\nallowed, ridicule and irony in attacks on established religion should\nbe prosecuted by the magistrate. This is a clear indication of how\nmuch his Anglican opponents had let Collins\u2019 irreverent wit,\nbiting satire and ironical remarks get under their skin.\nCollins\u2019 opponent was vulnerable on a number of points and\nCollins makes telling arguments against his claim. He notes that the\nbest writers on religion will be found to be committing these crimes\nin disputation; that the best punishment would be either to be ignored\nor to return ridicule with ridicule\u2014rather than to be punished\nby the magistrate. He points out that when Mr. Marshall discovers how\nmany of those who practice these crimes are of his party and are\nencouraged in these practices he will give up his position, and so on.\nThe theme of allowing liberty of discourse in public debates about\nreligion is the over-arching theme of the Discourse, and it\nis certainly one of the main themes of Collins\u2019 work throughout\nhis life.\n",
