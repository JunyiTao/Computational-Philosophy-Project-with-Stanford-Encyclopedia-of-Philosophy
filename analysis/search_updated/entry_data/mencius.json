    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Confucian Background\n\n\u201cMencius\u201d is a Latinization (coined by Jesuit missionaries\nin the 17th century) of the Chinese \u201cMengzi,\u201d meaning\nMaster Meng. His full name was \u201cMeng Ke.\u201d Our main access\nto Mencius\u2019s thinking is through the eponymous collection of his\ndialogues, debates, and sayings, the Mengzi\n(Mencius). This work was probably compiled by his disciples\nor disciples of his disciples. It was subsequently edited and\nshortened by Zhao Qi in the second century C.E., who also wrote a\ncommentary on the text. This version of the text was used by\nsubsequent scholars and is the version available to us nowadays. The\nreceived text of the Mengzi is divided into seven\n\u201cbooks,\u201d each of which is subdivided into two parts\n(labeled \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d in English), and then\nfurther subdivided into \u201cchapters.\u201d As a result, a passage\ncan be uniquely identified in any translation; for example, 1A1 is the\nfirst passage in any edition or translation of the text and 7B38 is\nthe last.\n\nMencius lived in the second half of the Zhou dynasty (c.\n1040\u2013221 BCE), a period of great social and intellectual\nferment. The founders of the Zhou dynasty had justified their rule by\nclaiming that it was mandated by Heaven (ti\u0101n). Heaven\nis a higher power that is responsible for the general course of\nhistory, and that favors those with Virtue\n (d\u00e9).[1]\n However, during the Eastern Zhou period (770\u2013221 BCE), it\nseemed increasingly clear that the Zhou dynasty had lost\nHeaven\u2019s favor. The Zhou king had become merely a figurehead,\nand real power lay in the hands of the rulers (typically dukes) of the\ndifferent states into which the realm was divided. These rulers\nincreasingly usurped the power and prerogatives of the Zhou king, and\nalso waged war against each other. Those in positions of power lived\nin fear of execution or assassination, while peasants suffered under\nthe burden of heavy taxation, the depredations of bandits, and the\ndevastation of invading armies. During this period,\n\u201cmasters\u201d articulated various accounts of the Way\n(d\u00e0o, the right way to live and to organize society)\nthat would rescue people from the contemporary chaos and suffering.\nOne of these thinkers was Mencius, who self\u2013identified as a\nfollower of Confucius: \u201cEver since man came into this world,\nthere has never been one greater than Confucius\u201d (2A2; Lau 2003,\n67). Consequently, it is helpful in understanding Mencius to know\nsomething about the basic themes of Confucianism. Confucius is the\nfirst individual thinker we know of to advocate a systematic vision of\nthe Way. The Analects is traditionally viewed as a reliable\nsource of his sayings, but in contemporary scholarship there is\nconsiderable controversy over its historical\n accuracy.[2]\n Nonetheless, we clearly find in the Analects expressions of\nall the major themes that would be characteristic of Confucianism for\nthe next two and a half millennia. In particular, the Confucius of the\nAnalects emphasizes the importance of (1) revivalistic\ntraditionalism; (2) rule through Virtue rather than brute force; (3)\nritual as a model for ethical behavior; (4) the family; and (5)\nethical cultivation.\n\nConfucius saw himself as merely explicating and defending the\nteachings of the wise sage kings of the past: \u201cI transmit rather\nthan innovate. I trust in and love the ancient ways\u201d\n(Analects 7.1; Slingerland 2003, 64). However, Confucius\nhimself called for changes, sometimes radical ones, to contemporary\npractice. Like revivalists of modern times (such as Martin Luther\nKing, Jr., Gandhi, or William Sloane Coffin), Confucius sought to\nbring about positive change in the present by reviving ideals from his\nown tradition that were treated by his contemporaries as stagnant\nplatitudes. Mencius similarly took inspiration from the ancient sages.\nHowever, Mencius also stressed the need to read the classics\ncreatively and critically. Speaking of one of the Confucian classics,\nhe stated, \u201cIt would be better not to have the\nDocuments than to believe everything in it\u201d (7B3; Van\nNorden 2008, 185).\n\nOne of the lessons Confucius learned from the ancient texts was the\nimportance of ruling the people through ethical inspiration rather\nthan coercion. Many rulers and government ministers in\nConfucius\u2019s era advocated the use of military power to address\nexternal threats and strict punishments to deal with internal\ndisorder. Confucius did not completely dismiss the use of force, but\nhe regarded it as a last resort, and as ultimately ineffective when\nused as the primary method of governing. \u201cIf you try to guide\nthe common people with coercive regulations and keep them in line with\npunishments, the common people will become evasive and will have no\nsense of shame\u201d (Analects 2.3; Slingerland 2003, 8).\n(We see a similar denigration of the use of brute force in Mencius. In\na memorable turn of phrase, Mencius warned one ruler that to attempt\nto conquer the world through warfare is as hopeless as \u201cclimbing\na tree in search of a fish\u201d [1A7].) In place of penal sanctions,\nConfucius advocated leading the people by moral inspiration and by the\nsubtle but ubiquitous effect of social mores: \u201cIf, however, you\nguide them with Virtue, and keep them in line by means of ritual, the\npeople will have a sense of shame and will rectify themselves\u201d\n(ibid.). Confucius\u2019s reference to Virtue here reflects the\nconcept\u2019s political origins. The word we render\n\u201cVirtue\u201d is \u201cde.\u201d It originally\nreferred to a sort of political charisma a king accumulated through\nhis good character and acts of kindness and generosity. Subjects would\nwillingly follow a ruler with Virtue, without the need for coercion.\nAlthough Virtue was originally something only a true king could\npossess, it came to be thought of as an attribute of any person with\ngood character (i.e., a \u201cvirtuous\u201d person), regardless of\nsocial\n status.[3]\n By the end of the Zhou dynasty, it had come to be used as a countable\nnoun referring to specific virtues, such as benevolence, courage, and\n wisdom.[4]\n Although de is thus very close to our concept of virtue, its\nassociations with royal charisma are distinctive. Consequently, it has\nbecome conventional to use \u201cVirtue\u201d (with a capital\n\u201cV\u201d) when translating the specific term\n\u201cde,\u201d and to use \u201cvirtue\u201d (with a\nlower case \u201cv\u201d) when one needs a generic term for\nreferring to traits of good character, such as righteousness and\nloyalty.\n\nAs Analects 2.3 (quoted above) suggests, ritual plays an\nimportant role in Confucius\u2019s social and ethical philosophy.\n\u201cRitual (l\u012d)\u201d originally referred to formal\nceremonies, such as burnt offerings of food and wine to the spirits of\none\u2019s ancestors. However, its meaning gradually expanded over\ntime to include etiquette (e.g., the proper way to greet or say\nfarewell to a guest) and ethics in general. Confucius stressed that\nappropriate emotions are essential to correct performance of rituals:\n\u201cSomeone who lacks magnanimity when occupying high office, who\nis not respectful when performing ritual, and who remains unmoved by\nsorrow when overseeing mourning rites\u2014how could I bear to look\nupon such a person?\u201d (Analects 3.26; Slingerland 2003,\n18) Mencius also stressed the importance of ritual. However, he\nemphasized that ritual cannot be followed inflexibly (see Section 2,\nbelow, and Mengzi 4A17, 5A2, 6B2, and Analects 9.3).\n\n\nThe family is central to Confucian ethics in at least two ways. First,\nConfucius advocates agent\u2013relative constraints on action that\nare based on familial\n relationships.[5]\n When the ruler of a state brags to Confucius that his subjects are so\n\u201cupright\u201d that a son turned in his father for stealing a\nsheep, Confucius responds, \u201cAmong my people, those who we\nconsider \u2018upright\u2019 are different from this: fathers cover\nup for their sons, and sons cover up for their fathers.\n\u2018Uprightness\u2019 is to be found in this\u201d\n(Analects 13.18; Slingerland 2003, 147). Second, the family\nis a crucial environment for nurturing virtue. Confucius\u2019s\ndisciple Youzi sketched an influential account of the role of filial\npiety in the development of complete virtue: \u201cA young person who\nis filial and respectful of his elders rarely becomes the kind of\nperson who is inclined to defy his superiors, and there has never been\na case of one who is disinclined to defy his superiors stirring up\nrebellion. The gentleman applies himself to the roots. \u2018Once the\nroots are firmly established, the Way will grow.\u2019 Might we not\nsay that filial piety and respect for elders constitute the root of\nGoodness?\u201d (Analects 1.2; Slingerland 2003, 1) We see\nhere the beginning of what became one of Mencius\u2019s most\ninfluential doctrines: that benevolence and righteousness are achieved\nthough \u201cextension\u201d of the love and respect first\nmanifested in the family.\n\nConfucius was painfully aware that virtue and the proper performance\nof the rituals are not common in his society:\n\n\nI have yet to meet a man who loves Virtue as much as he loves sex\n(Analects 9.18; cf. Slingerland 2003, 92).\n\nNowadays \u201cfilial\u201d means simply being able to provide\none\u2019s parents with nourishment. But even dogs and horses are\nprovided with nourishment. If you are not respectful, wherein lies the\ndifference? (Analects 2.7; Slingerland 2003, 10)\n\n\nConsequently, one of the central issues in Confucianism is how to\ncultivate virtues such as benevolence, loyalty, and filial piety.\nConfucius stresses the importance of both learning (by studying\nclassic texts and following the rituals) and reflecting: \u201cIf you\nlearn without reflecting, you will be lost. If you reflect without\nlearning, you will be in danger\u201d (Analects 2.15; cf.\nSlingerland 2003, 13). However, many of the debates among Confucians\nof the following two and a half millennia are about the precise form\nthat learning and reflecting take, and their relative importance (see\nIvanhoe 2000). Xunzi (discussed in Section 5, below) emphasized study\nof the classics and performance of rituals, as did Dong Zhongshu,\nwhose formulation of Confucianism was deeply influential in the Han\ndynasty (202 BCE-220 CE). In contrast, Mencius, while not denying the\nvalue of the classics and ritual, stressed reflection based upon\none\u2019s own innate dispositions toward virtue.\n\nMencius was born about a century after the death of\n Confucius.[6]\n Details of Mencius\u2019s early life are sketchy and uncertain, but\nhe is said to have been born in the state of Zou, in what is now\nShandong Province. His father supposedly died when Mencius was young,\nleaving him and his mother in poverty, and there are several famous\nstories of the determination of Mencius\u2019s mother to provide a\ngood education for her\n son.[7]\n Mencius is said to have studied under Confucius\u2019s grandson\nZisi, and then as an adult he traveled to different states in an\nattempt to convince their rulers to govern through benevolence and\nmoral suasion rather than brute force. Like the majority of later\nConfucians, Mencius was what we would describe as a \u201cpublic\nintellectual.\u201d He offered advice on everything from foreign\npolicy to the minutiae of public works. One passage from the\nMengzi is a detailed treatise on tax policy (3A3), which\nincludes Mencius\u2019s famous proposal to adopt the\n\u201cwell\u2013field system\u201d of taxation: a village\u2019s\nfields would be divided into nine equal sections, so that the borders\nbetween them looked like what we would recognize as a\ntic\u2013tac\u2013toe grid. (This shape happens to resemble the\ncharacter for \u201cwell,\u201d hence the name\n\u201cwell\u2013field.\u201d) One family would be assigned to each\nof the eight outer squares, and would keep the produce from that\nfield. Caring for the inner field would be the joint responsibility of\nall the families, and the produce from that field would belong to the\ngovernment as its tax. \n\nMencius held office in the state of Qi (2B6\u20137). During this\nperiod, he was involved in Qi\u2019s invasion of Yan, although the\nprecise nature of his role was disputed. The state of Yan was in\nturmoil due to a succession crisis. Mencius was asked, unofficially,\nwhether it might be legitimate to invade Yan to restore order. He\nreplied that it was. However, after Qi successfully invaded and\nannexed Yan, Mencius complained that he had not encouraged the\nspecific actions that Qi took, which apparently included widespread\nkilling of noncombatants and taking spoils of war (see 2B8, 1B10,\n1B11, and 2B9, in that order). Mencius eventually resigned his\nposition, when it became clear to him that the ruler was unwilling to\nenact any of the reforms that he proposed (2B10\u201313).\n\nAfter years of traveling from state to state, trying to advise rulers,\nMencius retired from public life. Mencius advocated acceptance of the\nwill of Heaven (2B13); however, he must have been disappointed with\nhis inability to improve government during his lifetime, and this is\nreflected in the plaintive tone of the closing passage of the\nMengzi: \u201cFrom Confucius to the present time is a little\nmore than one hundred years. It is not long from the era of a sage,\nand we are close to the home of a sage. Yet where is he? Where is\nhe?\u201d (7B38; Van Norden 2008, 197).\n2. The Virtues and Their Cultivation\n\nOne of Mencius\u2019s most influential views was his list of four\ninnate ethical dispositions, which he treats as what Western ethicists\nwould call cardinal virtues: benevolence (r\u00e9n),\nrighteousness (y\u00ec), wisdom (zh\u00ec), and\npropriety (l\u012d). Each of the four virtues is associated\nwith a characteristic emotion or motivational attitude: \u201cThe\nfeeling of compassion is benevolence. The feeling of disdain is\nrighteousness. The feeling of respect is propriety. The feeling of\napproval and disapproval is wisdom\u201d (Mengzi 6A6; Van\nNorden 2008, 149). Among these four, Mencius devotes the most\ndiscussion to benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence is manifested\nin the affection one has for his or her own kin, as well as compassion\nfor the suffering of other humans, and even concern for\nnon\u2013human animals. However, according to Confucians, one should\nalways have greater concern for, and has greater obligations toward,\nrelatives, teachers, and friends than one does for strangers and\nanimals (7A45). Benevolence is not simply a matter of feeling a\ncertain way: it also has cognitive and behavioral aspects. A fully\nbenevolent person will be disposed to recognize the suffering of\nothers and to act appropriately. Thus, a genuinely benevolent ruler\nwill notice how his policies will affect his subjects, and will only\npursue policies consistent with their well being (1B5). Righteousness\nis a disposition to disdain or regard as shameful dishonorable\nbehavior or demeaning treatment. As is the case with benevolence,\nrighteousness has cognitive and behavioral aspects. Thus, a righteous\nperson would object to being addressed disrespectfully (7B31), and\nwould not engage in an illicit sexual relationship (3B3). A fully\nrighteous person would also recognize that it is just as shameful to\naccept a large bribe as it is to accept a small bribe (6A10), and so\nwould refuse to accept either.\n\nMencius suggests that wisdom and propriety are secondary in importance\nto benevolence and righteousness: \u201cThe core of benevolence is\nserving one\u2019s parents. The core of righteousness is obeying\none\u2019s elder brother. The core of wisdom is knowing these two and\nnot abandoning them. The core of ritual propriety is the adornment of\nthese two\u201d (4A27; Van Norden 2008, 101). As the preceding\npassage suggests, wisdom involves an understanding of and commitment\nto the other virtues, especially benevolence and righteousness. Other\npassages indicate that a wise person has the ability to properly\nassess individuals and has skill at means\u2013end deliberation\n(5A9). Mencian wisdom (somewhat like Aristotelian\nphron\u0113sis) seems to be only partially constrained by\nrules. He notes that no sage would kill an innocent person, even if it\nmeant obtaining control of (and being able to benefit) the whole world\n(2A2). However, he also stresses that sages often act very differently\nfrom one another, but if they \u201chad exchanged places, each would\nhave done as the other\u201d (Mengzi 4B31; Van Norden 2008,\n114; cf. 4B29). The ultimate standard for any action is\n\u201ctimeliness\u201d (5B1), which seems to mean performing the\nright action out of the appropriate motivation for this particular\nsituation.\n\nPropriety is manifested in respect (6A6) or deference (2A6) toward\nelders and legitimate authority figures, especially as manifested in\nceremonies and etiquette. The character for the virtue of propriety is\nidentical with the one for ritual, reflecting the close connection\nbetween this virtue and such practices. Mencius thinks that matters of\nritual place legitimate ethical demands on us, but he stresses that\nthey are not categorical, and can be overridden by more exigent\nobligations. For example, he notes that rescuing one\u2019s\nsister\u2013in\u2013law if she were drowning would justify violation\nof the ritual prohibition on physical contact between unmarried men\nand women (4A17; cf. 5A2, 6B2). Knowing when to violate ritual is a\nmatter of wisdom.\n\nMencius discusses other virtues in addition to benevolence,\nrighteousness, wisdom, and propriety, but it seems that they are\nultimately manifestations of the preceding virtues. For example, in a\nnuanced account of courage, Mencius distinguishes between courage as\nexemplified in stereotypically daring behavior (assaulting anyone who\ninsults you), in fearlessness, and in a commitment to righteousness.\nMencius suggests that the last kind of courage is the highest form.\nCourage based on righteousness will lead to fearless opposition to\nwrongdoing, but also humble submission when one finds oneself in the\n wrong.[8]\n\n\nMencius holds that all humans have innate but incipient tendencies\ntoward benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, and propriety. Employing an\nagricultural metaphor, he refers to these tendencies as\n\u201csprouts\u201d (2A6). The sprouts are manifested in cognitive\nand emotional reactions characteristic of the virtues. For example,\nall humans feel compassion for the suffering of other humans and\nanimals, at least on some occasions, and this is a manifestation of\nbenevolence. Similarly, every person has some things that he or she\nwould be ashamed to do, or some forms of treatment he or she would\ndisdain to accept, and these are expressions of righteousness.\nHowever, as Mencius\u2019s carefully chosen sprout metaphor suggests,\nhumans are not born with fully formed virtuous dispositions. Our\nnascent virtues are sporadic and inconsistent in their manifestations.\nConsequently, a ruler who manifests genuine benevolence when he spares\nan ox being led to slaughter may nonetheless ignore the suffering of\nhis own subjects. Likewise, someone who would disdain to be addressed\ndisrespectfully may feel no compunction in acting against his\nconvictions in the face of a large bribe. In order to become genuinely\nvirtuous, a person must \u201cextend\u201d or \u201cfill out\u201d\nhis or her nascent virtuous inclinations. As Mencius puts it:\n\u201cPeople all have things that they will not bear. To extend this\nreaction to that which they will bear is benevolence. People all have\nthings that they will not do. To extend this reaction to that which\nthey will do is righteousness. If people can fill out the heart that\ndoes not desire to harm others, their benevolence will be\ninexhaustible. If people can fill out the heart that will not\ntrespass, their righteousness will be inexhaustible\u201d\n(Mengzi 7B31; Van Norden 2008, 192). One of the most\nintriguing issues in Mencius\u2019s philosophy is the proper way to\nunderstand his claim that we must \u201cextend\u201d (tui, ji,\nda) or \u201cfill out\u201d (kuo, chong) our innate\nbut incipient virtuous reactions (1A7, 2A6, 7A15, 7B31).\n\nThe discussion of this issue has a long history, but was revived in\nWestern scholarship by Nivison\n (1980).[9]\n In a much\u2013discussed example (1A7), Mencius draws a\nruler\u2019s attention to the fact that he had shown compassion for\nan ox being led to slaughter by sparing it. Mencius then encourages\nthe king to \u201cextend\u201d his compassion to his own subjects,\nwho suffer due to the ruler\u2019s wars of conquest and exorbitant\ntaxation. The basic structure of Mencian extension is clear from this\nexample. There is a paradigm case, C1, in which an\nindividual\u2019s sprout of compassion is manifested in cognition,\nemotion, and behavior. (In 1A7, C1 is the ox being led to\nslaughter. The king perceives that the ox is suffering, feels\ncompassion for its suffering, and acts to spare it.) There is also a\ncase that is relevantly similar to the paradigm case, C2,\nbut in which the individual does not currently have the same\ncognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions. (In 1A7, C2\nis the king\u2019s subjects. Although his subjects suffer, the king\nignores their suffering, has no compassion for it, and does not act to\nalleviate it. The relevant similarity between C1 and\nC2 in the case of 1A7 is suggested by the fact that the\nking describes the ox as having a \u201cfrightened appearance, like\nan innocent going to the execution ground.\u201d) Extension is the\nmental process by which one comes to recognize the ethically relevant\nsimilarity of C1 to C2, have the same emotional\nreaction to C2 as to C1, and behave the same\ntoward C2 as to C1. (Were the king to extend\nfrom the ox to his subjects, he would notice their suffering, feel\ncompassion for them, and change his current military and civil\npolicies. Later in 1A7, Mencius provides concrete advice about which\npolicies to enact.) Nivison\u2019s work raises the issue of how the\ncognitive, motivational, and behavioral aspects of Mencian extension\nare related. What is the connection between the king\nperceiving the logical similarity of the suffering of the ox\nto the suffering of his own people and the king actually being\nmotivated to act to help his\n people?[10]\n\nMencius suggests that, for most people, there are three prerequisites\nfor extension: an environment that meets people\u2019s basic physical\nneeds, ethical education, and individual effort. (1) Only a handful of\npeople, Mencius argues, have the strength of character to \u201chave\na constant heart\u201d in the face of physical deprivation. Most\npeople will resort to crime in the face of hunger and fear:\n\u201cWhen they thereupon sink into crime, to go and punish the\npeople is to trap them. When there are benevolent persons in positions\nof authority, how is it possible for them to trap the people?\u201d\n(1A7; Van Norden 2008, 14) Consequently, Mencius stresses that it is\nthe obligation of government to ensure that the people are\nwell\u2013fed and free from the fear of violence. (2) Nonetheless,\nthe satisfaction of physical needs is insufficient to ensure the\nvirtue of the common people. Socialization is also necessary:\n\u201cThe Way of the people is this: if they are full of food, have\nwarm clothes, and live in comfort but are without instruction, then\nthey come close to being animals\u201d (3A4; Van Norden 2008, 71).\nThis socialization includes learning the rituals (the etiquette and\nceremony of social interactions) as well as instruction in the\nfundamental \u201chuman roles\u201d: \u201cbetween father and\nchildren there is affection; between ruler and ministers there is\nrighteousness; between husband and wife there is distinction; between\nelder and younger there is precedence; and between friends there is\nfaithfulness\u201d (ibid.). (3) The first two factors are necessary\nand sufficient to ensure that most people will not become bestial.\nHowever, achieving the level of a \u201csage\u201d or\n\u201cworthy\u201d requires considerable individual effort. Mencius\nillustrates this with an example of learning the board game of\ngo:\n\nNow, go is an insignificant craft. But if one does not focus\none\u2019s heart and apply one\u2019s intention, then one\nwon\u2019t get it. \u2018Go Qiu\u2019 was the best at\ngo throughout the world. Suppose you told Go Qiu to\nteach two people go, and one focuses his heart and applies\nhis intention to it, listening only to Go Qiu. The other,\nalthough he listens to him, with his whole heart thinks about hunting\nswans, reflecting [s\u012b] only upon drawing his bow to\nshoot them. Although he learns together with the other person, he will\nnot be as good as he. Will this be because his intelligence is not as\ngreat? I answer that it is not. (6A9; Van Norden 2008, 153)\n\n\nMencius refers to the mental activity required for full extension as\n\u201creflection (s\u012b).\u201d Whether someone engages\nin reflection is ultimately dependent upon the individual\u2019s\ncommitment to doing so (see 6A6 and 6A15, discussed in Section 3\nbelow). However, classic texts and teachers can assist by inducing or\nguiding these activities. Thus, Mencius is trying to induce reflection\nin the king in 1A7 by directing the king\u2019s attention to the\nsimilarities between the ox he felt compassion for and his own\nsubjects. Mencius similarly tries to induce reflection in a government\nofficial who asks whether it is permissible to reduce the crushing tax\nburden on the peasants slightly this year, and wait until next year to\nlower it to a reasonable level. Mencius replies, \u201cSuppose there\nis a person who every day appropriates one of his neighbor\u2019s\nchickens. Someone tells him, \u2018This is not the Way of a\ngentleman.\u2019 He says, \u2018May I reduce it to appropriating one\nchicken every month and wait until next year to stop?\u2019 If one\nknows that it is not righteous, then one should quickly stop\u201d\n(3B8; Van Norden 2008, 83). Mencius also guides reflection through\nphilosophical dialogue (7A40, literally, \u201cquestion and\nanswer\u201d). This is illustrated in discussions with his disciples\nWan Zhang (5A1\u20139) and Gongsun Chou (2A1\u20132). Stories from\nclassic Confucian texts (particularly the Odes and\nDocuments) are often a stimulus for these discussions,\nhelping to illustrate the role such works play in Mencian ethical\neducation.\n\nOne aspect of reflection is particularly salient: it is insufficient\nfor successful extension that one merely recognize, in an abstract or\ntheoretical manner, the similarity between two situations. One must\ncome to be motivated and to act in relevantly similar ways. Because of\nthe preceding requirement, an intense topic of discussion among later\nConfucians influenced by Mencius is the relationship between knowledge\nand action. For example, Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529) famously\nargued for the \u201cunity of knowing and acting,\u201d as the most\nplausible interpretation of Mencius\u2019s view: \u201cThere never\nhave been people who know but do not act. Those who \u2018know\u2019\nbut do not act simply do not yet know\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden\n2014, 267). From a Western perspective, one of the noteworthy aspects\nof Mencius\u2019s view of extension is that he regards emotions as a\ncrucial part of ethical perception and evaluation. Although it would\nbe anachronistic to saddle him with any specific contemporary account\nof the emotions, it seems clear that his underlying view is close to\nwhat Western psychologists and philosopher call an \u201cappraisal\ntheory\u201d of emotions, according to which emotions are\nmotivational states closely connected to evaluations of situations (de\nSousa 2014, Section 4).\n3. The Goodness of Human Nature\n\nMencius is perhaps best\u2013known for his claim that \u201c[human]\nnature is good\u201d (x\u00ecng sh\u00e0n). As A.C.\nGraham (1967) demonstrated in a classic essay, Mencius and his\ncontemporaries regarded the nature of X as the characteristics that X\nwill develop if given a healthy environment for the kind of thing X\nis. A characteristic, C, can be part of the nature of X even if there\nexists an X such that X does not have C. For example, language use is\npart of the nature of a human being, but there are cases of humans\nwho, due to neurological damage or simply failure to be exposed to\nlanguage prior to the onset of adolescence, fail to develop a capacity\nfor language use. It is even possible for C to be part of the nature\nof X if most instances of X do not have C. For example, it is\nthe nature of an orange tree to bear fruit, but the majority of orange\nseeds do not even germinate, much less grow to maturity. Consequently,\nan important aspect of Mencius\u2019s claim that human nature is good\nis that humans have a tendency to become good if raised in an\nenvironment that is healthy for them. This thesis runs the danger of\nbecoming viciously circular: we might characterize goodness as the\nresult of growing up in a healthy environment, and a healthy\nenvironment as one that results in humans being\n good.[11]\n However, Mencius\u2019s claims about human nature, virtues, ethical\ncultivation, and political philosophy are nodes in a complex web of\nbeliefs that appeals to our intuitions (e.g., it is normal for humans\nto show compassion for the suffering of others) as well as empirical\nclaims (e.g., humans are less likely to manifest compassion when\nsubject to physical deprivation). Mencius\u2019s views might be\nmistaken, but they cannot be casually dismissed as naively circular;\nrather, they must be evaluated as a complex and subtle account of\nethics and philosophical psychology.\n\nProbably the two most important passages for understanding\nMencius\u2019s view of human nature are 6A6 and 6A15. In the former,\nMencius\u2019s disciple Gongsun Chou asks him to explain how his\nposition differs from those who say that \u201chuman nature is\nneither good nor not good,\u201d those who claim that \u201chuman\nnature can become good, and it can become not good,\u201d and those\nwho state that \u201cthere are natures that are good, and there are\nnatures that are not good.\u201d Mencius replies, \n\nAs for what they are inherently [q\u00edng], they can\nbecome\n good.[12]\n This is what I mean by calling their natures [x\u00ecng]\ngood. As for their becoming not good, this is not the fault of their\npotential. Humans all have the feeling [x\u012bn] of\ncompassion. Humans all have the feeling of disdain. Humans all have\nthe feeling of respect. Humans all have the feeling of approval and\ndisapproval. The feeling of compassion is benevolence. The feeling of\ndisdain is righteousness. The feeling of respect is propriety. The\nfeeling of approval and disapproval is wisdom. Benevolence,\nrighteousness, propriety, and wisdom are not welded to us externally.\nWe inherently have them. It is simply that we do not reflect upon\n[s\u012b] them. (Van Norden 2008, 149)\n\n\nHuman nature is good, on this view, because becoming a good person is\nthe result of developing our innate tendencies toward benevolence,\nrighteousness, wisdom, and propriety. These tendencies are manifested\nin distinctively moral emotions, correlated with the virtues. Each\nhuman \u201cinherently\u201d has a heart with the capacity for these\nemotions. They will manifest themselves, at least sporadically, in\neach human. If we \u201creflect upon\u201d these manifestations, we\ncan develop our innate capacities into fully formed virtues.\n\nIf the human capacity for goodness is rooted in our nature,\nisn\u2019t our capacity for evil equally grounded in our nature?\nMencius addresses the problem of human wrongdoing in 6A15, when his\ndisciple Gongduzi asks, \u201cWe are the same in being humans. Yet\nsome become great humans and some become petty humans. Why?\u201d\nMencius replies, \u201cthose who follow their greater part become\ngreat humans. Those who follow their petty part become petty\nhumans.\u201d Gongduzi persists, \u201cWe are the same in being\nhumans. Why is it that some follow their greater part and some follow\ntheir petty part?\u201d Mencius replies,\n\nIt is not the function of the ears and eyes to reflect, and they are\nmisled by things. Things interact with things and lead them along. But\nthe function of the heart is to reflect [si]. If it reflects,\nthen it will get it. If it does not reflect, then it will not get it.\nThis is what Heaven has given us. If one first takes one\u2019s stand\non what is greater, then what is lesser will not be able to snatch it\naway. This is how to become a great person. (6A15; Van Norden 2008,\n156)\n\n\nIn modern Western philosophy, we primarily think of \u201cears and\neyes\u201d as organs of sensory perception, whose characteristic\nerrors are cognitive (e.g. Descartes\u2019 example of a square tower\nthat appears round from far away). However, in ancient Chinese\nthought, eyes, ears, and the other sensory organs are primarily\nassociated with sensual desires (e.g., lovely sights, beautiful music,\nfine foods, etc.). Physical desires are never treated as intrinsically\nproblematic. However, they can \u201cmislead\u201d by leading us to\nfocus on them to the exclusion of a more inclusive comprehension that\nincludes our ethical\n motivations.[13]\n Thus, according to the account Mencius sketches in 6A15, our sensual\ndesires can lead us to wrongdoing if we pursue them without also\nengaging our ethical motivations. This is an especially acute danger\nbecause our sensory desires always respond automatically and\neffortlessly to their appropriate objects, while our moral motivations\nare more selective. Mencius suggests the mechanical responsiveness of\nour sense organs by describing them as simply \u201cthings\u201d:\n\u201cThings interact with things and lead them along.\u201d In\ncontrast, the full development of our ethical motivations requires\nthat our heart engage in \u201creflection\u201d: \u201cIf it\nreflects, then it will get it. If it does not reflect, then it will\nnot get it.\u201d The heart \u201cgets it\u201d in that it engages\nthe appropriate ethical\n motivations.[14]\n\n\nMencius provides a concrete illustration of moral failure and how to\novercome it in a dialogue with a ruler who confesses, \u201cI have a\nweakness. I am fond of wealth.\u201d Mencius explains that a great\nruler of ancient times was similarly fond of wealth, but he ensured\nthat \u201cthose who stayed at home had loaded granaries, and those\nwho marched had full provisions\u2026. If Your Majesty is fond of\nwealth but treats the commoners the same, what difficulty is there in\nbecoming [a great] King?\u201d The ruler continues to temporize:\n\u201cI have a weakness. I am fond of sex.\u201d Mencius cites the\nexample of an ancient ruler who was also fond of sex. However, he made\nsure (by not wasting male lives in needless warfare, or collecting an\nunusually large harem) that \u201cthere were no bitter women in\nprivate, or any unmarried men in public. If Your Majesty is fond of\nsex but treats the commoners the same, what difficulty is there in\nbecoming [a great] King?\u201d (1B5; translation slightly modified\nfrom Van Norden 2008, 23\u201324) The ruler\u2019s desires for\nwealth and sex are not problematic in themselves, but he has been\npursuing them in a manner that ignores benevolence, which would direct\nhim to share his joys with others.\n\nThe preceding discussion suggests that Kwong\u2013loi Shun\u2019s\nsummary is correct: in stating that human nature is good,\n\u201cMencius was saying that human beings have a constitution\ncomprising certain emotional predispositions that already point in the\ndirection of goodness and by virtue of which people are capable of\nbecoming good\u2026. One\u2019s becoming bad is not the fault of\none\u2019s constitution, but a matter of one\u2019s injuring or not\nfully developing the constitution in the appropriate direction\u201d\n(Shun 1997, 219\u201320). \n\nThe statement that \u201c[human] nature is good [x\u00ecng\nsh\u00e0n]\u201d is often misquoted as \u201c[human] nature\nis fundamentally good [x\u00ecng b\u0115n\nsh\u00e0n].\u201d The latter phrase actually derives from a\ngloss on Mencius\u2019s view popularized by the seminal commentator\nZhu Xi (1130\u20131200). Zhu Xi held that Mencius was simply\nexplicating what was implicit in the sayings of Confucius. Confucius\nstated that \u201cnatures are close to one another, but become far\nfrom one another by practice\u201d (Analects 17.2). In order\nto explain why Confucius described human natures as merely\n\u201cclose to\u201d one another, while Mencius referred to them as\nidentically \u201cgood,\u201d Zhu Xi argued that Mencius was\nreferring to the ultimate, underlying human nature in itself, whereas\nConfucius was referring to human nature as manifested in concrete\n embodiments.[15]\n Zhu Xi\u2019s view became orthodoxy, and was even written into the\nopening lines of the Three Character Classic, a primer for\nlearning to read Chinese that was memorized by schoolchildren for\ncenturies:\n\nAt its beginning,\n\nhuman nature is fundamentally good.\n\nHuman natures are close to one another,\n\nbut become far from one another by practice.\n\nIt is only when there is not education,\n\nthat their natures\n deviate.[16]\n\n\nWhile ingenious, this interpretation of Mencius is unmotivated without\nthe assumption that the Analects and Mengzi must be\nexpressing the same view. \n\nThe term \u201cnature\u201d occurs in only 17 passages in the\nMengzi (3A1, 4B26, 6A1\u20134, 6A6, 6A8, 6B15, 7A1, 7A21,\n7A30, 7A38, 7B24, 7B33), and the specific phrase \u201c[human] nature\nis good\u201d only occurs in two of these (3A1, 6A6). However, there\nis some plausibility to Zhu Xi\u2019s suggestion that the latter\nclaim is operative in many passages where it is not mentioned\nexplicitly, because of how intimately it is connected with other\naspects of Mencius\u2019s view (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 213).\nThis will become clearer as we consider Mencius\u2019s critiques of\nother philosophers in his era.\n4. Mencius and His Philosophical Opponents\n\nMencius was often an incisive critic of other philosophers. In\nresponse to a philosopher who advocated price fixing, Mencius asks,\n\u201cIf a fine shoe and a shoddy shoe are the same price, will\nanyone make the former?\u201d (3A4; Van Norden 2008, 73) When the\nsame philosopher suggests that rulers and government officials should\nfarm the land, just like their subjects, Mencius draws an analogy with\nother crafts: just as the potter, blacksmith, and farmer each benefit\nby focusing on his craft and exchanging goods with the others, so does\neveryone benefit when good rulers and officials focus on their own\nactivities in exchange for financial support from the other members of\nsociety (3A4). Another philosopher argues that human nature is\nidentical with the characteristics a human has in virtue of being\nalive. Mencius performs a swift reductio ad absurdum, pointing out\nthat\u2014since dogs, oxen, and humans are the same in being\nalive\u2014the proposed definition entails that dogs, oxen, and\nhumans have the same nature\n (6A3).[17]\n\nMencius viewed himself as a defender of the Confucian tradition, and\nsaw the two major contemporary threats to that tradition as the\ndoctrines of Mozi and Yang Zhu: \u201cthe doctrines of Yang Zhu and\nMozi fill the world. If a doctrine does not lean toward Yang Zhu, then\nit leans toward Mozi. Yang Zhu is \u2018for oneself.\u2019 This is\nto not have a ruler. Mozi is \u2018impartial caring.\u2019 This is\nto not have a father. To not have a father and to not have a ruler is\nto be an animal\u201d (Mengzi 3B9; Van Norden 2008, 85).\nMozi (fifth century BCE) is the first systematic philosophical critic\nof Confucianism. He is generally interpreted as a sort of impartial\nconsequentialist, who grounds ethics in maximizing overall benefit or\nprofit, where this is defined in terms of material goods such as\nwealth, populousness, and social order. On this basis, Mozi criticizes\nthe Confucian emphasis on ritual, regarding as wasteful such Confucian\npractices as elaborate funerals, lengthy mourning periods, and musical\nperformances. In addition, Mozi advocated impartial caring\n(ji\u0101n \u00e0i, sometimes translated \u201cuniversal\nlove\u201d), which he distinguished from the filial piety or\ndifferentiated caring of the Confucians. Mozi argued that caring more\nfor oneself, one\u2019s family, or one\u2019s state was the cause of\nthe warfare and cruelty of his era, and that impartial caring would\nlead to greater harmony and material satisfaction. Mozi certainly did\nnot advocate eliminating the family as a social institution. However,\nhe clearly rejected Confucian differentiated caring in favor of\nimpartial caring: \u201cI have heard that in order to be a superior\nperson in the world, one must regard the well-being of one\u2019s\nfriends as one regards one\u2019s own well being; one must regard the\nparents of one\u2019s friends as one regards one\u2019s own parents.\nOnly in this way can one be a superior person\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van\nNorden 2001, 70). Mozi presented a number of ingenious arguments in\nfavor of his position, including a \u201cstate of nature\u201d\nargument to justify government authority (Mozi 11; Ivanhoe\nand Van Norden 2005,\n 65),[18]\n and a thought-experiment to justify impartial caring that seems\nalmost game-theoretic in its precision (Mozi 16; Ivanhoe and\nVan Norden 2005, 69\u201370). In addition, to win over those\nattracted to Confucianism, Mozi argues that the goal of filial piety\nwill in fact be best achieved by not favoring one\u2019s own parents\nover others: \u201cClearly one must first care for and\nbenefit the parents of others in order to expect that they in turn\nwill respond by caring for and benefiting one\u2019s own parents. And\nso for such mutually filial sons to realize unlimited good results,\nmust they not first care for and benefit other people\u2019s\nparents?\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van Norden, 75; emphasis\n mine)[19]\n Mozi acknowledged that people do not seem to be predisposed to have\nimpartial care for others. However, he argued that human motivations\nare highly malleable, and can be radically altered, so long as humans\nare given appropriate rewards for compliance and punishments for\ndisobedience. As evidence for his claim, he cites the example of\n\nKing Ling of the state of Chu [who] was fond of slender waists. During\nhis reign the people of Chu ate no more than one meal a day and became\nso weak that they could not raise themselves up without the support of\na cane nor could they walk without leaning against a wall. Curtailing\none\u2019s food is something very difficult to do, but masses of\npeople did it in order to please King Ling. Within a single generation\nthe people changed because they wanted to accord with the wishes of\ntheir superior. (Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 75)\n\n\nMozi was not just an original philosophical thinker; he was also the\nfounder of an organized movement, the Mohists, which survived his\ndeath and continued to be influential until the Qin dynasty (221\nBCE\u2013207 BCE) reunified China. \n\nThere is controversy about what the views of Yang Zhu (fifth to fourth\ncentury BCE)\n were.[20]\n However, a plausible case can be made that he defended ethical egoism\nbased on a particular conception of human nature. Yang Zhu\u2019s\nline of argument has considerable plausibility in his philosophical\ncontext. Although Mohists and Confucians disagreed about many things,\nthey agreed on two key points: the proper Way to live and to organize\nsociety is dictated by Heaven, and this Way will sometimes demand\nextreme self\u2013sacrifice of those who follow it. Yang Zhu invoked\nthe notion of \u201chuman nature [r\u00e9n\nx\u00ecng]\u201d to drive a wedge between the former\ncommitment and the latter. Yang Zhu appealed to the fact that nothing\nseems more natural for humans than self\u2013preservation. But if\nthere is a human nature, it must be dictated by Heaven, and therefore\nmust be consistent with the Way. Consequently, following one\u2019s\ninstinct for self\u2013preservation is actually the highest\nexpression of Heaven\u2019s will, and the self\u2013sacrificing\npractices of the Confucians and Mohists are simply perversions of our\nHeaven\u2013given nature. The Mohist response to this, as suggested\nby the example (cited above) of King Ling of Chu, was that there is no\nsuch thing as human nature; human motivations are highly malleable,\nand almost exclusively the products of environmental influences. \n\nMencius\u2019s doctrine that human nature is good was part of his\nstrategy to present a Confucian response to both the Mohists and Yang\nZhu. Mencius agreed with Yang Zhu that humans have a determinate\nnature. However, he presented arguments that there is more to human\nnature than the purely self\u2013interested motivations identified by\nYang Zhu. His most famous argument for this conclusion is the thought\nexperiment of the child at the well:\n\nThe reason why I say that all humans have hearts that are not\nunfeeling toward others is this. Suppose someone suddenly saw a child\nabout to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have a\nfeeling of alarm and compassion\u2014not because one sought to get in\ngood with the child\u2019s parents, not because one wanted fame among\none\u2019s neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike\nthe sound of the child\u2019s cries. From this we can see that if one\nis without the feeling of compassion, one is not human.\n(Mengzi 2A6; Van Norden 2008, 46)\n\n\nConsequently, Mencius agreed with Yang Zhu that we are following the\nwill of Heaven (and hence the Way) by following our nature. However,\nhe argued that Yang Zhu had an implausibly impoverished conception of\nwhat human nature is like. \n\nAgainst the Mohists, Mencius argues that human nature places practical\nand ethical constraints on an ethical doctrine. These points are\nexpressed in an argument Mencius has with the Mohist Yi Zhi. Mencius\nasks the rhetorical question, \u201cDoes Yi Zhi truly hold that\none\u2019s affection for one\u2019s own nephew is like one\u2019s\naffection for a neighbor\u2019s baby?\u201d (3A5; Van Norden 2008,\n74) In other words, since humans naturally care more for relatives\nthan for strangers, any ethical system that, like Mohism, demands\nimpartiality will be impractical. Mencius also states, \u201cHeaven,\nin giving birth to things, causes them to have one source, but Yi Zhi\ngives them two sources\u201d (ibid.). In other words, the Mohists\nacknowledge the ethical authority of Heaven (the \u201csource\u201d\nof the Way), but their doctrine of impartial care is set up as a\nsecond \u201csource,\u201d and one that demands deviating from our\nHeaven\u2013endowed nature. In summary, the impartial caring\nadvocated by the Mohists is both perverse and\n impractical.[21]\n\n\nMencius also presents an argument that the Mohist position is\nself\u2013defeating in\n practice.[22]\n When he is politely greeted by a ruler who suggests that Mencius had\ndeigned to visit because he \u201cmust have a way of profiting my\nstate,\u201d Mencius rebukes him:\n\nWhy must Your Majesty speak of \u201cprofit\u201d? Let there simply\nbe benevolence and righteousness. If your majesty says, \u201cHow can\nI profit my state?\u201d the Chief Counselors will say, \u201cHow\ncan I profit my clan?\u201d and the nobles and commoners will say,\n\u201cHow can I profit my self?\u201d Superiors and subordinates\nwill seize profit from each other, and the state will be endangered.\n\u2026 Never have the benevolent left their parents behind. Never\nhave the righteous put their ruler last. Let Your Majesty speak only\nof benevolence and righteousness. Why must one speak of\n\u201cprofit\u201d? (1A1; Van Norden 2008, 1)\n\n\nAlthough the Mohists are not mentioned explicitly in this passage, the\nword \u201cprofit\u201d is central to their formulation of impartial\nconsequentialism, so it is likely that Mencius intended their views as\npart of his target. Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107) concisely summarized\nthe argument here: \u201cA gentleman never fails to desire profit,\nbut if one is single\u2013mindedly focused on profit, then it leads\nto harm. If there is only benevolence and righteousness, then one will\nnot seek profit, but one will never fail to profit\u201d (Van Norden\n2008, 2).\n5. Later Influence and Interpretations\n\nIn his own era, Mencius\u2019s views were criticized by the Daoist\nZhuangzi and by his fellow Confucian Xunzi. Zhuangzi never refers to\nMencius by name, but several passages seem to clearly be directed at\nhim. In a passage that argues against the possibility of objective\nethical knowledge, Zhuangzi states, \u201cFrom where I see it, the\nsprouts of benevolence and righteousness and the pathways of right and\nwrong are all snarled and jumbled\u201d (Zhuangzi 2; Ivanhoe\nand Van Norden 2005, 222). The phrase \u201csprouts of benevolence\nand righteousness\u201d (r\u00e9n y\u00ec zh\u012b\ndu\u0101n) is quite unusual, and many translators struggle to\nmake sense of\n it.[23]\n The key is to remember Mencius\u2019s phrases \u201csprout of\nbenevolence\u201d (r\u00e9n zh\u012b du\u0101n) and\n\u201csprout of righteousness\u201d (y\u00ec zh\u012b\ndu\u0101n) from 2A6. While Mencius compares our innate but\nincipient dispositions toward virtue to the sprouts of plants, which\nmust be cultivated in order to reach maturity, Zhuangzi suggests that\nthere is no way to disentangle \u201csprouts\u201d from weeds, if\nthere even is any non\u2013arbitrary distinction between them.\nAnother implicit critique of Mencius is found in a fictional dialogue\nin which Zhuangzi uses \u201cConfucius\u201d as the spokesperson for\nhis own views, and advises someone, \u201cDo not listen with your\nheart but listen with your q\u00ec. \u2026 The heart\nstops with signs. Qi is empty and waits on external things.\nOnly the Way gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the\nheart\u201d (modified from Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 228). So\nZhuangzi prioritizes following the qi, the impersonal fluid\nthat flows through all things and binds them together, over following\nthe heart. This seems to be a deliberate inversion of Mencius\u2019s\nview in 2A2, where he advises, \u201cWhat you do not get from your\nheart, do not seek for in the qi\u201d (2A2; Van Norden\n2008, 37). Notice also that, whereas Mencius encourages us to\ncultivate our heart, Zhuangzi encourages us to \u201cfast\u201d\n it.[24]\n\nXunzi attacks Mencius by name in his essay, \u201cHuman Nature Is\nBad\u201d:\n\nMengzi says: When people engage in learning, this manifests the\ngoodness of their nature. I say: This is not so. This is a case of not\nattaining knowledge of people\u2019s nature and of not inspecting\nclearly the division between people\u2019s nature and their\ndeliberate efforts. \u2026 Those things in people that cannot be\nlearned and cannot be worked at are called their \u201cnature.\u201d\nThose things in people that they become capable of through learning\nand that they achieve through working at them are called their\n\u201cdeliberate efforts.\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 299)\n\n\nIt is common to observe that Mencius and Xunzi are speaking at\ncross\u2013purposes, because they assume different conceptions of the\nkey term \u201cnature\u201d (Graham 1967). For Mencius, a\nparadigmatic example of something fulfilling its nature is a sprout\nmaturing into a full\u2013grown plant. This process requires a\nhealthy environment and is assisted by active cultivation on the part\nof the farmer. In contrast, for Xunzi, only the characteristics that\nsomething has fully and innately are part of its nature: \u201cNow\npeople\u2019s nature is such that their eyes can see, and their ears\ncan hear. \u2026 it is clear that one does not learn these\nthings\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 299\u2013300). However,\nit is possible that Mencius and Xunzi still have a substantive\ndisagreement, even if Xunzi\u2019s way of framing that disagreement\nis misleading. As we have seen, Mencius thinks that all humans are\nborn with innate but incipient dispositions toward virtue. Xunzi seems\nto explicitly deny this: \u201cAs for the way that the eyes like\npretty colors, the ears like beautiful sounds, the mouth likes good\nflavors, the heart likes what is beneficial, and the bones and flesh\nlike what is comfortable \u2014 these are produced from\npeople\u2019s inborn dispositions and nature\u201d (Ivanhoe and Van\nNorden 2005, 300). In contrast, \u201c\u2026 ritual and the\nstandards of righteousness are produced from the deliberate effort of\nthe sage \u2026\u201d (ibid.). The fundamentally different views of\nMencius and Xunzi on human nature are reflected in their different\nmetaphors for ethical cultivation. For Mencius, ethically cultivating\nhuman nature is like encouraging the innate tendency of a sprout to\ngrow to maturity; for Xunzi, humans require ethical cultivation just\nas \u201ccrooked wood must await steaming and straightening on the\nshaping frame, and only then does it become straight. Blunt metal must\nawait honing and grinding, and only then does it become sharp\u201d\n(Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2005, 298).\n\nConfucianism became a state\u2013sponsored ideology during the Han\ndynasty (202 BCE\u2013220 C.E.), but it was a syncretic form of the\nphilosophy that included elements of Daoism, Legalism, and the\ncosmological notions of yin\u2013yang and the Five Phases.\nMencius\u2019s writings were only one of many influences in this\nperiod. After the fall of the Han, Buddhism became increasingly\ninfluential socially and intellectually, reaching a peak in the Tang\ndynasty (618\u2013907). This provoked a Confucian revivalist\nmovement, the Learning of the Way (D\u00e0oxu\u00e9),\nconventionally referred to in English as Neo\u2013Confucianism. The\npolemical anti\u2013Buddhist writings of Han Yu (768\u2013824) are\noften seen as the flashpoint for the Confucian revival. In addition to\ndenouncing Buddhist practices as unnatural and antithetical to the\nwell being of the state, Han Yu singles out Mencius as the \u201cmost\npure\u201d of the followers of Confucius. Neo\u2013Confucianism only\ncomes to philosophical maturity, though, during the Song and Southern\nSong dynasties (960\u20131279). The major intellectual competitors to\nConfucianism at this time were Buddhism and Daoism.\nNeo\u2013Confucians compared Mozi\u2019s impartial caring to\nBuddhist universal compassion. Similarly, Yang Zhu\u2019s egoism was\nseen as anticipating the Daoist search for individual immortality.\nConsequently, Neo\u2013Confucians availed themselves of\nMencius\u2019s arguments against his contemporaries to combat their\nown intellectual rivals. As a result, Neo\u2013Confucians came to\nregard Mencius as having a particularly profound grasp of the true\nmeaning of the teachings of Confucius, elevating him to the status of\nthe \u201cSecond Sage.\u201d The most influential\nNeo\u2013Confucian philosopher was Zhu Xi, who grouped the\nMengzi along with three other Confucian classics (the\nGreat Learning, Analects, and Mean) as the\nFour Books, and wrote clear, detailed commentaries on each. Zhu\nXi\u2019s interpretations of the Four Books became orthodoxy, and\ngenerations of intellectuals literally memorized them in order to pass\nthe civil service examinations. Although the traditional exams were\nabolished at the beginning of the twentieth century, Zhu Xi\u2019s\ncommitment to reading the Four Books in the light of each other, and\nhis interpretations of specific concepts and passages, continue to\nhave an immense influence, even\n today.[25]\n\nIronically, due to the pervasive influence of Buddhism,\nNeo\u2013Confucian philosophers often reinterpreted Mencius\u2019s\nviews in the light of Buddhist metaphysical and ethical concepts.\nConfucians adopted the view that ethical cultivation was a matter of\nbecoming enlightened (w\u00f9) about the fundamental\nPattern (l\u01d0, also translated principle) of the universe\nand thereby overcoming the selfishness (s\u012b) of human\ndesires (r\u00e9n y\u00f9) and forming one body\n(y\u00ec t\u01d0) with everyone and everything else.\nHowever, these terms are either absent or used in different senses in\nthe texts of Confucius and\n Mencius.[26]\n This criticism was made within the Chinese tradition by later\nConfucians such as Dai Zhen (1724\u20131777), who argued that, due to\nBuddhist influence, the Neo\u2013Confucians understood terms like\n\u201cPattern\u201d in anachronistic ways, and were led to an ethics\nthat unnaturally devalued physical human desires (see Dai 1777). \n\nIn the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals became part of\nthe May 4th Movement, which called for China to rapidly Westernize and\nmodernize. As a result, Mencius\u2019s intellectual reputation\nsuffered along with the rest of Confucianism. This trend continued\nduring the rule of Mao Zedong, when Confucianism was dismissed as a\ndecadent part of China\u2019s \u201cfeudal\n past.\u201d[27]\n However, interest in Mencius continued in Hong Kong and Taiwan as\npart of the movement known as New Confucianism. New Confucianism is a\ndiverse movement and it is difficult to find a commonly\nagreed\u2013upon characterization of what is central to it. However,\nmany New Confucians are influenced by the views of Mou Zongsan\n(1909\u20131995), who argued that Mencius and the Neo\u2013Confucian\nWang Yangming accurately explicated what is implicit in the views of\nConfucius. In addition, Mou saw Kant as providing a way of\nunderstanding what is distinctive about the Mencian conception of\nmorality, but also thought that Confucian ethics transcends certain\nlimitations of Kant\u2019s\n thought.[28]\n\nSince the death of Mao, there has been a resurgence of interest in\nConfucianism in mainland China. As a result, Mencius has become\nembroiled in contemporary debates over the role of Confucianism in\nChinese ethics and political philosophy. In two much\u2013debated\npassages, Mencius endorses the actions of a ruler who seems to put\nloyalty to his family over the welfare of the state (5A3, 7A35). Some\nargue that this illustrates that Mencius (and Confucianism in general)\nis committed to a form of nepotism that encourages corruption (see,\ne.g., Liu 2007). Others have argued for alternative interpretations of\nthe significance of these passages (e.g., Guo 2007). Mencius is also\nat the center of the larger debate about whether Confucianism is\nconsistent with democracy (see Chan 1999). Mencius has been invoked as\nproviding a potential foundation for democracy (Bai 2008), but others\nhave cautioned about overestimating the extent to which he champions\nthe will of the people as the source of political authority (Tiwald\n2008). \n\nAnother recent trend in the study of Mencius and other Confucian\nphilosophers has been the application of the framework of virtue\nethics, beginning with Yearley\n (1990).[29]\n Mencius does seem similar to some major virtue ethicists such as\nAristotle in emphasizing wisdom as a flexible responsiveness to\ncomplex situations, the cultivation of virtue over\naction\u2013guiding rules, and nuanced discussions of the differences\nbetween genuine virtues and semblances or counterfeits of them (e.g.,\n7B37). However, as advocates of virtue ethics interpretations\nacknowledge, there are also substantial differences between Mencius\nand any Western virtue ethics. For example, Western virtue ethicists\nsuch as Aristotle place great value on purely theoretical\ncontemplation, which Confucians typically regard as lacking intrinsic\nvalue. An additional contrast is that Confucians like Mencius see\nfamilial life as an important and intrinsic component of living well,\nwhereas Aristotelians (arguably) see the family as, at best, a\nnecessary means to supporting virtuous action.\n\nNew Confucian and virtue ethics interpreters of the Mengzi\nhave both been criticized for projecting an alien vocabulary onto the\ntext. Indeed, sometimes advocates of the two approaches make these\nobjections against one another (see Yu 2008, and Angle and Slote\n2013). However, any interpreter must bring to the text her own\nvocabulary for explicating what seems obscure. This is true whether\nthe commentators are Song dynasty Confucians using\nBuddhist\u2013influenced terms in Middle Chinese, New Confucians\navailing themselves of Kantian notions while writing in contemporary\nMandarin, or English\u2013language scholars employing the vocabulary\nof virtue ethics. Consequently, the only real issue is whether they\nhave provided the most plausible explanation of what is implicit in\nthe texts they interpret. The ongoing debates on these issues promise\nto be exciting and productive. \n",
