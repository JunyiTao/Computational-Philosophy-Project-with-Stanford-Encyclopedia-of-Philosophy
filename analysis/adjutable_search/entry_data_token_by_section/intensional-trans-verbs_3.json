    "main_text": "Montague\u2019s semantics\n4. Montague\u2019s semantics\n\nThe main non-propositionalist approaches to ITVs begin from the work\nof Richard Montague, especially his paper \u201cThe Proper Treatment\nof Quantification in Ordinary English\u201d (Montague 1973), usually\nreferred to as PTQ in the literature (Montague\u2019s condition (9) (1974,\n264) defines \u2018seek\u2019 as \u2018try to find\u2019, but this\nis optional). Montague developed a systematic semantics of natural\nlanguage based on higher-order intensional type-theory. We\nexplain this term right-to-left.\n\nType theory embodies a specific model of semantic compositionality in\nterms of functional application. According to this model, if\ntwo expressions x and y can concatenate into a\nmeaningful expression xy, then (i), the meaning of one of\nthese expressions is taken to be a function, (ii) the meaning of the\nother is taken to be an item of the kind that the function in question\nis defined for, and (iii) the meaning of xy is the output of\nthe function when applied to the input. The type-theoretic\nrepresentation of this meaning is written x(y) or\ny(x), depending on which expression is taken to be\nthe function and which the input or argument. A functional application\nsuch as x(y) is said to be well-typed iff\nthe input that y denotes is the type of input for\nwhich the function x is defined.\n\nFor example, in the simple theory of types, a common noun\nsuch as \u2018sweater\u2019 is assigned a meaning of the following\ntype: a function from individuals to truth-values (a function of type\nib, for short; b for \u2018boolean\u2019). For\n\u2018sweater\u2019 the function in question is the one which maps\nall sweaters to the truth-value TRUE, and all other individuals to the\ntruth-value FALSE. On the other hand, an (\u201cintersective\u201d)\nadjective such as \u2018woollen\u2019 would be assigned a meaning of\nthe following type: a function from (functions from individuals to\ntruth-values) to (functions from individuals to truth-values), or a\nfunction of type (ib)(ib) for short. Thus the\nmeaning of \u2018woollen\u2019 can take the meaning of\n\u2018sweater\u2019 (an ib) as input and produce the\nmeaning of \u2018woollen sweater\u2019 (another ib) as\noutput; this is why the meaning of \u2018woollen\u2019 has the type\n(ib)(ib). woollen(sweater) is the\nspecific function of type ib that maps sweaters made of wool\nto TRUE, and all other individuals to FALSE.\n\nIn this framework, a quantified NP such as \u2018every sweater\u2019\nhas a meaning which can take the meaning of an intransitive verb\n(e.g., \u2018unravelled\u2019), or more generally, a Verb Phrase\n(VP), as input and produce the meaning (truth-value) of a sentence\n(e.g. \u2018every sweater unravelled\u2019) as output. Intransitive\nverbs and VPs are like common nouns in being of type ib. For\nexample, the VP quickly(unravelled) is of type\nib, mapping all and only individuals that unravelled quickly\nto TRUE. So a quantified NP is a function from inputs of type\nib to outputs of type b, and is thus of type\n(ib)b. \u2018Every sweater unravelled\nquickly\u2019 would be represented as\n(every(sweater))(quickly(unravelled)), and would\ndenote the truth-value that is the result of applying a meaning of\ntype (ib)b, that of every(sweater),\nto a meaning of type ib, that of\nquickly(unravelled) (the adverb\nquickly itself is of type (ib)(ib),\nlike the adjective woollen). Rules specific to\nevery guarantee that every(sweater)\nmaps quickly(unravelled) to TRUE iff\nquickly(unravelled) maps to TRUE everything that\nsweater maps to TRUE.\n\nSo far, the apparatus is extensional, which, besides providing only\ntwo possible sentence-meanings, TRUE and FALSE, imposes severe\nlimitations on the range of concepts we can express. Suppose that the\nScottish clothing company Pringle has a monopoly on the manufacture of\nwoollen sweaters, and makes sweaters of no other material. Then a\ngarment is a woollen sweater iff it is a Pringle sweater, meaning that\nwoollen(sweater) and\npringle(sweater) are the same function of type\nib, and these two terms for that function are everywhere\ninterchangeable in the type-theoretic language. Then modal operators\nsuch as \u2018it is contingent that\u2019 cannot be in the language,\nsince interchanging woollen(sweater) and\npringle(sweater) within their scope should sometimes\nlead to change of truth-value, but cannot if the two expressions\nreceive the same meaning in the semantics. For example, \u2018it is\ncontingent that every Pringle sweater is woollen\u2019 is true, but\n\u2018it is contingent that every woollen sweater is woollen\u2019\nis false. Therefore the concept of contingency has no adequate\nrepresentation in the type-theoretic (boldface) language.\n\nShifting to intensional type theory deals with this\ndifficulty. The intension of any expression X is a function from\npossible worlds to an extension of the type which that expression has\nin the extensional theory just sketched, if it has such an extension,\notherwise to something appropriate for intensional vocabulary such as\n\u2018it is contingent that\u2019. An intension which is a function\nfrom possible worlds to items of type t is\nsaid to be of type st.\nsweater, for instance, will have as its intension a\nfunction from possible worlds to functions of type ib,\nproviding for each possible world a function that specifies the\nindividuals which are sweaters at that world; so\nsweater\u2018s intension is of type\ns(ib). However, a modal sentential operator such as\n\u2018it is contingent that\u2019 will have as its intension a\nfunction that, for each possible world, produces the very same\nfunction, which takes as input functions of type sb and\nproduces truth-values as output. So the extension of \u2018it is\ncontingent that\u2019 at each world is the same function, of type\n(sb)b. (The operator is said to be\nintensional because its extension at each world is a\nfunction taking intensions, such as functions of type sb, as\ninput.)\n\nA function of type sb is sometimes called a\npossible-worlds proposition, since it traces the truth-value\nof a sentence across worlds. For example, with appropriate assignments\nto the constituents,\n\n(13)\n\n(every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen)\n\n\nshould be true, that is, refer to TRUE, at every\n world.[5]\n So the intension of (13) is the function f\nof type sb such that for every world w,\nf(w) = TRUE. This is a constant\nintension. On the other hand,\n\n(14)\n\n(every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen)\n\n\nis true at some worlds but false at others, those where Pringle makes\nnon-woollen sweaters; so its intension is non-constant.\n\nWe define the intension of contingent to be the\nfunction which, for each world w as input, produces as output the\nfunction c of type (sb)b\nsuch that for any function p of type\nsb, c(p)\nis true at w iff there are worlds u and v such that\np(u) = TRUE and\np(v) = FALSE (this is the meaning of\n\u2018contingent that\u2019 in the sense \u2018contingent\nwhether\u2019). So the intension of \u2018contingent\u2019 is also\nconstant, since the same function c is the\noutput at every world.\n\nSince contingent expects an input of type\nsb, we cannot write\n\n(15)\n\ncontingent((every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen))\n\nsince in evaluating this formula at a world w we would find ourselves\ntrying to apply the reference of contingent at w,\nnamely, the function c just defined, to the\nreference of (every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen) at w,\nnamely, the truth-value TRUE. But c requires\nan input of type sb, not b. So we introduce a new\noperator, written ^, such that if X is an expression\nand t is the type of X\u2019s reference at each\nw, then at each w, the reference of ^X is of type\nst. ^X may be read as\n\u2018the intension of X\u2019, since the rule for\n^ is that at each world, ^X refers\nto that function which for each world w, outputs the reference of X at\nw.\n\nIf we now evaluate\n\n(16)\n\ncontingent^((every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen))\n\n\nat a world w, the result will be FALSE. This is because the function\np of type sb that is the reference\nof ^((every(woollen(sweater)))(woollen)) at every\nworld, maps every world to TRUE. So there is no u such that\np(u) = FALSE. But there is such a u for\n^((every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen)), and so\n\n(17)\n\ncontingent^((every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen))\n\nis TRUE at w. Note that choice of w doesn\u2019t matter, since the\nintension of contingent produces the same function\nc at every world, and the reference of,\ne.g., ^((every(pringle(sweater)))(woollen)), is the\nsame function of type sb at every world.\n\nFinally, our type-theory, intensional or extensional, is\nhigher-order, because the semantics makes available\nhigher-order domains of quantification and reference.\nsweater refers to a property of individuals, a\nfirst-order property. (every(sweater))\nrefers to a property of properties of individuals, a second-order\nproperty. For just as sweater(my favorite garment)\nattributes the property of being a sweater to a certain individual, so\nwe can think of (every(sweater))(woollen) as\nattributing a property to the property of being woollen. Which\nproperty is attributed to being woollen? The rules governing\nevery ensure that (every(F)) is\ntruly predicated of G iff G is a\nproperty of every F. In that case, G has the\nproperty of being a property of every F. So\n(every(F)) stands for the property of being a\nproperty of every F.\n\nTreating quantified NPs as terms for properties of properties means\nthey can occur as arguments to any expression defined for properties\nof properties. We can even rescue the uncomprehending student\u2019s\nattempt at \u2018Jack hit someone\u2019, for provided\n\u2018hit\u2019 is of the right type \u2014 which is easily\narranged \u2014 we can have (hit(someone))(jack).\nHere hit accepts the property of being a property of\nat least one person, and produces the first-order property of hitting\nsomeone, which is then attributed to Jack. In extensional type-theory,\nhit has the type\n((ib)b)(ib) if\n(hit(someone))(jack) is well-typed and\njack is of type\n i.[6]\n\nThe significance of this for the semantics of intensional transitives\nis that we now have a way of representing a reading of, say,\n\n(18)\n Jack wants a woollen sweater\n\n\nin which the quantified NP is within the semantic scope of the verb\nwithout having scope over a hidden subsentence with a free variable\nfor the NP to bind: the quantified NP \u2018a woollen sweater\u2019\ncan just be the argument to the verb. To allow for the intensionality\nof the transitive verb, Montague adopts the rule that if x\nand y can concatenate into a meaningful expression\nxy, the reference of the functional expression is a function\nwhich operates on the intension of the argument expression.\nSuppressing some irrelevant detail, this means that if\n\u2018wants\u2019 syntactically combines with \u2018a woollen\nsweater\u2019 to produce the VP \u2018wants a woollen\nsweater\u2019, then in its semantics, want applies\nto the intension of (a(woollen (sweater))), resulting\nin the following semantics for (18):\n\n(19)\n\nwant(^(a(woollen(sweater))))(jack).[7]\n\n\nIn (19), a(woollen((sweater)) is within the scope of\nwant. So if we take (19) to represent the notional\nreading of (18), the idea that notional readings are readings in which\nthe quantified NP has narrow scope with respect to the intensional\nverb is sustained.\n",
