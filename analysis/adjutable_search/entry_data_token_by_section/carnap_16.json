    "main_text": "Logical Syntax of Language\n5. Logical Syntax of Language\n\nThe Syntax is probably Carnap\u2019s best-known book, and\nhas attracted much of the renewed attention to Carnap in recent years.\nAt the time of its publication, the Vienna Circle was disintegrating,\nits members were fleeing from political persecution, and philosophical\ncommunication was disrupted. Its English translation, published 1937,\nlacked context and was almost uniformly misunderstood by nearly\neveryone, with the partial exception of Quine, whose later work in\nlogic, the philosophy of logic, and logic-based philosophy was\ninspired by\u2014though sometimes opposed to\u2014the Logical\nSyntax. Through Quine, some of Carnap\u2019s ideas eventually\nalso found their way into the logic education of many philosophy\ndepartments in the US. On the other hand, what Quine understood, as is\nevident from his 1934 Harvard Lectures, immediately after the\nbook\u2019s publication (reprinted in Creath 1990), was the first\ndraft of the Logical Syntax, in which the principle of\ntolerance was still absent. So even his comprehension of the\nSyntax was partial and one-sided (Creath 1987, Friedman\n2006). In any case, the book was widely assumed to have been\nsuperseded by the time the translation appeared, now that Carnap had\nmeanwhile embraced semantics and dropped his insistence on the\n\u201cformal mode of speech\u201d (above,\n section 1.3).\n Only recently, therefore, has the Syntax come to be\nappreciated in its full radicalism.\n\nIn this recent work, the principle of tolerance has attracted the most\nattention. Previously, the rejection of meaning and insistence on the\nformal, rather than the material, mode of speech had been in the\nforeground since, after all, the entire philosophical Part V of the\nbook had been devoted to it, and Quine had reinforced that emphasis.\nIt is fair to say that the principle of tolerance taken by\nitself\u2014unlike the notion of analyticity or theses of\nconventionalism (see the supplement\n Carnap vs Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction)\u2014was\n hardly discussed before its present, belated reception in the Carnap\nliterature. It is a new idea on the philosophical scene today, whose\nconsequences are still being digested.\n\nIt certainly has lost none of its explosive revolutionary force as a\nradical program for philosophy (Creath 2009), and this is what has\nmost divided commentators. Like most revolutionary ideas, it has\nencountered steadfast and vocal resistance. Most commentators have\nbeen concerned to limit the scope of the principle of tolerance, to\ndilute it or trivialize it, while the appreciative minority has mostly\nremained defensive. Much of the literature, therefore, is devoted to\nclarification and the correction of misunderstandings (e.g., Goldfarb\n& Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1994; Goldfarb 1995), rather than\npositive explorations of the principle of tolerance and its\nconsequences (with a few exceptions: Carus 2017, Kitcher 2008, Creath\n2009, Kutz, Mossakowski, and L\u00fccke 2010, Justus 2012). Thus the\nremainder of this section will, after a brief exposition of the\nbook\u2019s contents, focus on these recent discussions and\nclarifications. Carnap\u2019s principle of tolerance is discussed in\nmore detail in section 1 of the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology,\n and the Logical Syntax more generally in the supplement\n Logical Syntax of Language.\n",
