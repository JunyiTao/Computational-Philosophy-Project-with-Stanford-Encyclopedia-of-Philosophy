    "main_text": "The Nature and Purpose of Rhetoric\n4. The Nature and Purpose of Rhetoric\n\nThere are widely divergent views on the purpose of Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric. Ultimately, it is certainly meant to support those\nwho are going to address a public audience in court, at assemblies of\nthe people, or at certain festive events and who, to that end, have to\ncompose speeches. But does this in itself render the Rhetoric\na mere \u2018manual\u2019 or \u2018handbook\u2019 aiming at the\npersuasion of a given audience? Or does it rather aim at a\nspecifically qualified type of persuasion (bringing about, e.g.,\nconviction based on the best available grounds and without\nmisunderstanding)? Influenced by the debate in the 20th century about\n\u2018old and new rhetoric\u2019 and by the work of authors such as\nI.A. Richards, Kenneth Burke and Wayne C. Booth on the one hand and\nHans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur on the other, Aristotle scholars\nbegan to wonder whether his Rhetoric is an instruction manual\noffering guidance about how to change other people\u2019s minds or\nhas, rather, a philosophically more ambitious scope, such as e.g.\nhuman communication and discourse in general. This second approach is\nreflected in the statements of those contending that the \u201cobject\nof Aristotle\u2019s treatise on rhetoric is ultimately an analysis of\nthe nature of human discourse in all areas of knowledge.\u201d\n(Grimaldi 1972, 1) or of those suggesting that it can be read as\n\u201ca piece of philosophic inquiry, and judged by philosophic\nstandards\u201d (Garver 1994, 3). Others have diagnosed a most\nnotable ambivalence in the Rhetoric (see Oates 1963, 335), as between\nits role as a practical handbook on the one hand and Aristotle\u2019s\nattempt to connect it to his logic, ethics and politics on the other.\nLikewise, interpreters are divided on the questions of whether\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is meant to be used for good and\nbad purposes alike or whether it is specifically tailored to\nimplementing the good and virtuous goals delineated in\nAristotle\u2019s ethical and political writings; and whether, to that\nlatter end, the speaker is entitled to deploy the whole range of\npersuasive devices, even manipulative and deceptive ones. In many\ninstances, the text of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is open to\nseveral interpretations; however, it seems possible to restrict the\nrange of plausible readings, e.g. by considering Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition of rhetoric and what he says about the internal and\nexternal ends of rhetoric.\n",
