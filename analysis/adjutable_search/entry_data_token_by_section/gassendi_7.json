    "main_text": "Space and Time\n8. Space and Time\n\n\nEven putting aside the framework of atoms and void, the Gassendist\nontology poses an alternative to rival Aristotelian and Cartesian\nviews, with respect to space and time. Gassendi's conception of time\nand space is absolute. Time flows uniformly irrespective of any\nmotion, and space is uniformly extended regardless of any objects that\nmay be contained within it (O I 183, 285). Indeed, both space and time\npre-date Creation, and are infinite in character.\n\n\nGassendi borrows heavily on themes set out by earlier Italian space\nand time theorists, including Campanella, Bruno, Telesio, and Patrizi.\nOne possible advance is suggested by his discussion of such an\nontology as a prelude to his matter theory: space and time are\npre-conditions for the existence of substance, rather than properties\nof substances (as the Aristotelians would have it). In this regard,\nRochot (1971) proposes that Gassendi's ontology provides atoms as\nstable entities and absolute space-time as a stable environment, which\ntogether allow for a greater reliability of empirical data hence a\ngreater reliability of our data reception. The notion is that those data\nhave some fixity at the source, at least, given that the\nspace-time environment that contains material elements giving rise to\nsuch data are unbended by relativistic position to anything else.\nNaturally, such fixity would be only a necessary condition, and even\nfails to provide guarantees at the level of basic sensory data, which\nGassendi recognizes in his discussion of the Skepticist tropes.\n\n\nGassendi's notion of non-relative space stands in direct\ncontrast to the Cartesian plenist account, which suggests that space\njust is place, as defined by the extension of the resident (and\nuniversal) matter. This contrast bears a clear result relative to\nmatter theory: Descartes is locked into a view of matter as infinitely\ndivisible, in order to account for the absence of void or, what amounts\nto the same thing, the omnipresence of matter. Gassendi, on the other\nhand, is free to pose the existence of atoms and the void, where matter\nis located in space but is neither defined by nor definitive of that\nspace.\n",
