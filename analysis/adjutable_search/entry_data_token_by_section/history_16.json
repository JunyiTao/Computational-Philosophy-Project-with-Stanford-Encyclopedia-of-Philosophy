    "main_text": "Historical understanding and the twentieth century\n6. Ethics, history, and memory\n\nAs the previous section suggests, there is an ethical dimension\ninvolved in the quest for historical knowledge. Historians have\nobligations of truthfulness and objectivity; peoples have obligations\nof honest recognition; and nations have obligations of memory and\nreconciliation.\n\nHistorians themselves have obligations of truthfulness and objectivity\nin the accounts they provide of the past. This topic has occupied much\nof the discussion of history and ethics in the past few years (Fay\n2004). Much of this discussion has centered on the intellectual\nvirtues to which historians need to aspire, such as truthfulness,\nobjectivity, and persistence (Creyghton et al 2016, Paul 2015).\nPerhaps more generally, we might argue that historians have an\nobligation to deliberately and actively include those aspects of the\npast for further research that are the most morally\ntroublesome\u2014for example, the origins and experience of slavery\nduring the eighteenth century in the American South, or the role of\nthe Gulag in the Soviet Union in the twentieth century. We may\nreasonably fault the historian of the American South in the nineteenth\ncentury who confines her investigation to the economics of the cotton\nindustry without examining the role of slavery in that industry, or\nthe historian of the USSR who studies the institutions of engineering\nresearch in the 1950s while ignoring the fact of forced labor camps.\nHistorians have an obligation to squarely confront the hard truths of\ntheir subject matter.\n\nThere is a broader ethical question to ask about history that goes\nbeyond the professional ethics of the historian to the\nresponsibilities of the public in relation to its own history. The\nfacts of genocide and other crimes against humanity make it clear that\nthere are moral reasons for believing that all of humanity has a moral\nresponsibility to attempt to discover our past with honesty and\nexactness. In particular, the facts of past horrific actions\n(genocide, mass repression, slavery, suppression of ethnic minorities,\ndictatorship) create a moral responsibility for historians and the\npublic alike to uncover the details, causes, and consequences of those\nactions.\n\nThe thread of honesty and truthfulness runs through all of these\nethical issues. Tony Judt (1992) argues that a people or nation at a\npoint in time have a collective responsibility to face the facts of\nits own history honestly and without mythology. Judt\u2019s points\ncan be distilled into a few key ideas. Knowledge of the past matters\nin the present; being truthful about the past is a key responsibility\nfor all of us. Standing in the way of honest recognition is the fact\nthat oppressors and tyrants are invariably interested in concealing\ntheir culpability, while \u201cinnocent citizens\u201d are likewise\ninclined to minimize their own involvement in the crimes of their\ngovernments. The result is \"myth-making\", according to Judt. Anna\nWylegala (2017) illustrates the moral importance and complexity of\nthis kind of investigation with regard to collective memory in\npost-1991 Ukraine. The history of the twentieth century has shown\nitself to be especially prone to myth-making, whether about resistance\nto Nazi occupation or refusal to collaborate with Soviet-installed\nregimes in Poland or Czechoslovakia. Judt (1992) argues that a very\npervasive process of myth-making and forgetting has been a deep part\nof the narrative-making in post-war Europe. But, Judt argues, bad\nmyths give rise eventually to bad collective behavior\u2014more\nconflict, more tyranny, more violence. So the work of honest history\nis crucial to humanity\u2019s ability to achieve a better future.\nJudt expresses throughout his work a credo of truth-telling about the\npast: we have a weighty obligation to discover, represent, and\nunderstand the circumstances of our past, even when those facts are\ndeeply unpalatable. Myth-making about the past is not only bad history\nand bad politics, it is morally deficient.\n\nThis observation brings us to a final way in which moral questions\narise in the context of honest history. The crimes of the past have\nconsequences in the present. The facts of trans-Atlantic slavery\ncontinue to have consequences for millions of descendants of the men\nand women who were transported from Africa to the Americas; the facts\nof the Rwandan genocide have consequences for the living victims of\nthese mass killings and their kin; and the fact of colonial\nexploitation of the Congo or southern Africa has consequences for the\ncurrent poverty of much of Africa. Does knowledge of the crimes of the\npast create for the current generation an obligation of engagement in\ncontributing actively to healing those wounds in the present and\npreventing their recurrence in the future? Does \u201ctruth and\nreconciliation\u201d require more than simply recognizing ugly truths\nabout the past? Does it require that we act differently, individually\nand collectively? It is of course a tragic and immutable reality of\nthe human condition that the past cannot be changed; the murdered\ncannot be unmurdered, and the primary perpetrators of horrific crimes\nwithin a few generations are certainly beyond the reach of justice.\nThe future is deeply contingent, while the past is fixed and\nunchangeable. But does this immutability imply that the present\ngeneration has no obligations created by past crimes? Or rather, does\nknowing the truth about our past create for us the obligation to learn\nfrom those tragic human actions how to avoid such crimes in the\nfuture? Does honest knowledge of the human crimes of the past bring\nwith it an obligation to strive in good faith to address the\nconsequences of those crimes in the present? Finally, can knowledge of\nhistory help us to become more empathetic, more just, and more\nfarsighted in our dealings with each other in the grand affairs that\nmake up future history? One would hope so; and perhaps this is the\nmost pressing moral obligation of all that is created by our\nrecognition of our own historicity.\n",
