    "main_text": "Frege\n3. Frege\n\nThe second major historical contribution to the theory of generalized\nquantifiers came from the \u201cinventor\u201d of modern logic,\nGottlob Frege, in the 1870s. In fact, Frege\u2019s contribution is\ntwofold. As every philosophy student knows, he introduced the language\nof predicate logic, with sentential connectives, identity, and the\nvariable-binding operator \\(\\forall\\) (though his 2-dimensional\nlogical notation is no longer used). These are the quantifiers that\nlogicians during the 1950\u2019s began to \u201cgeneralize\u201d.\nBut Frege also explicitly formulated the abstract notion of a\nquantifier as a second-order relation, or, as he called it, a\nsecond level concept (\u201cBegriff zweiter\nStufe\u201d). He was well aware that the four Aristotelian\nquantifiers were prime examples, but he wanted to avoid the focus on\nsubject-predicate form, which he (with much justification) saw as\nhaving been a major obstacle to the development of logic after\nAristotle. It was therefore an important discovery that these\nquantifiers could all be defined in terms of \\(\\forall\\) and\nsentential operators (replacing all\\((A,B)\\)\nby \\(\\forall x(A(x) \\rightarrow B(x)\\)),\nsome\\((A,B)\\) by \\(\\neg\\forall x(A(x)\n\\rightarrow \\neg B(x)\\)), etc.).\n\nIn fact, the only significant difference between Frege\u2019s notion\nof a second-level concept and the modern notion of a generalized\nquantifier is that Frege did not have the idea of an\ninterpretation or model, which we now (since the\nadvent of model theory in the 1950s) see as a universe that\nthe quantifiers range over, plus an assignment of suitable semantic\nobjects to the non-logical symbols. Frege\u2019s symbols all had\nfixed meanings, and the only universe he considered was the totality\nof everything. But apart from this, one may well say that it was Frege\nwho discovered generalized quantifiers. This aspect of Frege\u2019s\nlogic, however, remained in the background for a long time, and model\ntheorists in the 50s and 60s seem not to have been aware of it.\n",
