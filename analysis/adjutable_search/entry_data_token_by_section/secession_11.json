    "main_text": "Secession and the Philosophy of International Law\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nPhilosophical work on secession falls into three main categories:\n(1) attempts to develop an account of the moral right to secede\n(understood either as a claim-right or as a mere liberty), (2)\ninvestigations of the compatibility or incompatibility of secession\nwith constitutionalism, and (3) attempts to determine what posture\ninternational law should adopt concerning secession. In each of these\nareas of inquiry, as well as in the connections among them, exploration\nof the moral issues of secession provides a powerful lens through which\nto examine some of the most important issues of moral-political theory,\nincluding perhaps the most fundamental issue of all: what gives a state\na valid claim to its territory?\n",
