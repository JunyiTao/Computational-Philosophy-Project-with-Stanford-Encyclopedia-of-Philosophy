Possibly, the philosophical privilege of the visible just\nreflects the cognitive privilege of the visible\u2014as vision is\nconsidered to account for most of useful sensory information\ngathering.\n\nWhat makes sounds worth of philosophical analysis is that they are not\nonly an important element of the perceptual scene but are also\nphilosophically idiosyncratic in many intriguing ways; in particular,\ntheir temporal and spatial unfolding, as presented in perception, has\ninteresting metaphysical and epistemological aspects. There is,\nhowever, an advantage of the neglect. Many philosophical aspects of\nsound and sound perception are not idiosyncratic and indeed make for\ngeneral issues in philosophy of perception. Hence in this article we\nwill take advantage of the many discussions that have used other\nsensory features such as colors as a paradigm of a sensory feature.\nFor instance, we shall not rehearse the discussion about the\nsubjectivity of secondary qualities, as the example of sounds does not\nseem to introduce new philosophically interesting elements that could\nchallenge generalizations obtained, say, from the example of\ncolors.\n\nThe main issues which are on the table concern the nature of sounds.\nSounds enter the content of auditory perception. But what are they?\nAre sounds individuals? Are they events? Are they properties of\nsounding objects? If they are events, what type of event are they?\nWhat is the relation between sounds and sounding objects? Temporal and\ncausal features of sounds will be important in deciding these and\nrelated questions. However, it turns out that a fruitful way to\norganize these issues deals with the spatial properties of sounds.\n\nIndeed, the various philosophical pronouncements about the nature of\nsounds can be rather neatly classified according to the spatial status\neach of them assigns to sounds. Where are sounds? Are they anywhere?\nThe main relevant families of answers include proximal, medial,\ndistal, and aspatial theories. Proximal theories would claim that\nsounds are where the hearer is. Medial theories\u2014exemplified by\nmainstream acoustics\u2014locate sounds in the medium between the\nresonating object and the hearer. Distal theories consider sounds to\nbe located at the resonating object. Finally, aspatial theories deny\nspatial relevance to sounds. There are significant variants of each of\nthese. Sound theories can also be classified according to other\ndimensions, such as the metaphysical status they accord to sounds (for\ninstance, as occurring events as opposed to properties or\ndispositions). We shall see some of the interactions between these\ndifferent accounts.

Proximal Theories of Sounds\n\nProximal theories of sounds construe sounds as located at or beneath\nthe bodily surface of the hearer. We distinguish two main strands.\n1.1 Sounds as Sensations\n\nModern philosophical accounts of sounds informed by psychology of\nperception construe sounds as \u201csensations\u201d, or\nstates/properties of hearers. Consider,\n\n\nIt seems\u2026reasonable to suggest that the sounds directly\nperceived are sensations of some sort produced in the observer when\nthe sound waves strike the ear. (Maclachlan 1989: 26)\n\n\nThe sound-as-sensations theory is justified by some facts about\nauditory experience. People report hearing voices and bells even when\nno one is speaking and no bell is ringing. Various examples of\nsubjective sounds are documented under the label of tinnitus. In an\nanechoic chamber, most subjects experience subjective buzzing and\nwhistlings. Some subjects undergo pathologic tinnitus when they hear\nsounds that disrupt their normal auditory capabilities. When Russian\ncomposer Shostacovich turned his head on a side, he was subject to a\nflow of melodies (Sacks 2008). Tinnitus and other subjective auditory\nphenomena have different causes, that can be related to the mechanical\nproperties of the inner ear or to more central features. The objects\nof these experiences are naturally and spontaneously categorized as\nsounds. If sounds are simply defined as the objects of audition, then\nthey are easily identified with the qualitative aspects of auditory\nperception. Various strands of indirect realism in perception would\nmake this view mandatory. According to them, it is by hearing the\nimmediate, proximal items that we hear some distal events or objects.\nIn such a case sounds would be defined as the immediate objects of\nauditory perception.\n1.2 Sounds as Proximal Stimuli\n\nA bit more peripheral, albeit still proximal, is a position, defended\nby (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000) claiming that the sound heard is where\nthe hearer is:\n\n\n\u2026while the sound originates at a distance and we can hear that\nit is coming from a direction and even place, and while there is no\nauditory experience of hearing that the sound is where we are, the\nsound that we hear is nonetheless where we are (2000: 447).\n\n\nThis leaves open the possibility that an unheard sound be located away\nfrom the hearer.\n\nSupport for this position comes from the following example. If I hear\nthe noise of a motorcycle far away, the physical event at my ear is\nqualitatively different from the physical event that is produced at\nthe motorcycle\u2019s place. If I was close to the motorcycle, the\nphysical event at my ear would be completely different from, and would\nnot correspond to that of a motorcycle driving far away. A party\nupstairs does not sound the way it sounds to participants to the\nparty. However, these arguments can be resisted on two counts. First,\none should distinguish between source and informational channel.\nConsider a visual analogue. From the fact that reflected light is the\nonly light that hits the eye, it does not follow that one does not see\nreflecting surfaces or is not aware of incident light. Reflected light\ncontains information about the reflecting object and the illumination,\nwhich is unpacked by the brain. In the case of sound, distance,\nechoes, reverberations, and filtering affect the informational channel\nin a way that informs about the position of the source. Second, the\nexamples used to support the proximal theory are unable to account for\nthe perceived constancy of auditory features of distant objects. The\nmotorcycle and the party can be judged to be very noisy, even if the\nphysical events at the hearer are faint because of the distance from\nthe respective sources. We do possess a notion of distal volume of a\nsound.\n\nThe locatedness of the sound at the hearer\u2019s position entails\nthat there are as many sounds as there are actual (or potential)\nhearers around. An alternate account would consider that one and the\nsame sound is present which is, however, multiply located.\n\nThese examples, and the related difficulties, thus suggest that a\nmajor shortcoming of proximal theories is that they do not locate\nsounds where an untutored description of what is perceived suggests\nthey are. This means that if sounds were inner sensations, or\nmechanical events at the ear, we would be almost always mistaken in\nour aural perceptions, at least on important aspects of the sound. In\nturn, this amounts to accounting for auditory perception in terms of a\nmassive error theory. We shall see that proximal theories are not\nalone in endorsing it.\n2. Medial Theories of Sounds\n\nMedial theories construe sounds as features of the medium in which a\nsounding object and a hearer are immersed. The identification of\nsounds with sound waves is the major example of medial theories.\n2.1 Sounds as Events or Properties of the Medium\n\nWhen speaking about voice in his treatise De Anima (On\nthe Soul), Aristotle wrote that sound is a \u201ccertain\nmovement of air\u201d (De Anima II.8 420b12) but, even\nthough he claimed that sound and motion are tightly connected, he did\nnot seem to identify them (Pasnau 2000: 32).  The natural scientists\nof the seventeenth century refined the intuition that sound is a\nmovement of air into the wave theory of sounds, which appeared to be\nan obvious competitor for the quality or sensation (proximal)\nview. Galileo registered that \n\n\nsounds are made and heard by us when\u2026the air\u2026is\nruffled\u2026and moves certain cartilages of a tympanum in our\near.\u2026high tones are produced by frequent waves and low tones by\nsparse ones. (1623 [1957: 276]) \n\n\nDescartes joined in and in his Passions of the Soul\nconsidered that what we actually hear are not the objects themselves,\nbut some \u201cmovements coming from them\u201d (1649: XXIII).\nIndeed, around 1636, Mersenne measured the speed of propagation of\nsound waves.\n\nBoth Galileo and Descartes were aware that the medial account was\nrevisionary relative to a common sense view of sounds, or at least as\nrevisionary as is the sensation view. Sounds for the wave view or the\nsensation view are not what we unreflectively take them to be on the\nbasis of the content of auditory perception. (Indeed, Galileo himself\nendorsed both a proximal theory\u2014sounds as sensations\u2014and a\nmedial theory, thereby possibly originating a dualist account.) At the\nsame time Galileo and Descartes, as well as other modern philosophers,\nwere not particularly keen in detailing the phenomenological content\nof auditory perception.\n2.2 Sounds as Waves\n\nThe wave account is, of course, endorsed by modern acoustics. Sounds\nare construed as mechanical vibrations transmitted by an elastic\nmedium. They are thus described as longitudinal waves, defined by\ntheir frequency and amplitude. A vibrating object (the sound source,\nsuch as a moving vocal chord or a vibrating tuning fork) creates a\ndisturbance in the surrounding medium (say, air, or water). Each\nparticle of the medium is set in back-and-forth motion at a given\nfrequency and with a given amplitude, and the motion propagates to\nneighboring particles at the same frequency, undergoing an energy loss\nthat entails a decrease in amplitude. Seen macroscopically, the\npropagation of sound is the propagation of a compression in the medium\nfollowed by a depression, that is, the propagation of a wave. The\nbehavior of each particle is described by a sinusoid that maps the\ncyclical pattern of compressions and depressions against time. A cycle\nis the complete path of the sinusoid from crease to crease, at the end\nof which the particle is back to its starting position. Amplitude is\nthe distance between creases and valleys in the sinusoid, period is\nthe distance between a crease and its successor, and frequency is the\nnumber of cycles per time unit.\n\nContemporary philosophers of perception of the physicalist strand tend\nto align themselves on the wave theory (Nudds 2010b, 2018; Kalderon\n2017; Meadows 2018). Perkins thus summarizes the view:\n\u201c\u2026the sound we hear is identical with the train of\nairwaves that stretches from the distant sounding object to our\near\u201d (1983: 168). And indeed, the physicalist account of sounds\nseems to make a good claim to successful reduction of key auditory\nphenomena based on the identification of sounds with sound waves in a\nmedium in which a sounding object (and possibly a hearer) is\npresent.\n2.3 Assessing the Wave Theory\n2.3.1 Arguments for the wave theory\n\nMany perceptual properties of sounds are neatly explained by the\npresence of strong correlations with properties of waves, in\nparticular pitch and intensity (i.e., volume).\n\nThe felt quality of high pitch is correlated with high\nfrequencies; low pitch is correlated with low frequencies;\nHigh volumes are correlated with high, low volumes with low,\namplitudes.\nThe directionality of sounds (the fact that they appear to be\n\u201cin a direction\u201d) is related to the fact that the hearer\nis located on a propagation line from the source.\nEven more accomplished is the explanation of particular auditory\neffects, such as the Doppler effect, whereby the speed of a sounding\nobject in motion contributes to a change in the sound\u2019s heard\npitch (so that the whistle of an engine passing by is heard to drop in\npitch as it travels past us).\n\n\nInterestingly enough, the reduction of sounds to waves in a medium is\narguably more successful than the corresponding attempt to reduce\ncolors to properties of electromagnetic waves. The latter attempt is\naffected by some major problems, such as the existence of non-spectral\ncolors like purple, or the fact that some spectral monochromatic\ncolors such as orange are seen as being composed colors.\n2.3.2 Arguments against the wave theory\n\nHowever, for all its merits, the medial identification of sounds with\nsound waves raises some objections and leaves some matters\nwanting.\n\nFor instance, there are metameric sounds (as there are metamers among\ncolors), that is, sounds that feel identical to the ear although the\ncorresponding medial properties are different. There is no one-to-one\npsychophysical correlation between auditory content and sounds as\nwaves (Churchland 2007: 222). Moreover, ultrasounds, above 20.000 Hz\nand infrasounds, below 20 Hz, have the same physical nature as\nsounds\u2014they are mechanical vibrations transmitted by an elastic\nmedium\u2014but they are not audible (as infrared and ultraviolet are\nnot visible in the domain of colors): do they count as sounds? It\nfurther appears that the relationship between sound and sounding\nobject remains underspecified. Do sound waves depend upon sounding\nobjects in the sense in which we usually think sounds (as auditory\nevents) do?\n\nMost importantly, as happened with proximal theories, medial theories\ndo not locate sounds where an untutored conception of auditory\nperception suggests they are. If sounds were sound waves, we would be\nalmost always mistaken in our aural perceptions on important aspects,\nwhich fact, once more, amounts to accounting for auditory perception\nin terms of a massive error theory.\n\nWhat is the nature of sounds under the wave theory? Relevant to our\npurposes, there are two main metaphysical conceptions about waves, in\nboth cases construed as individuals. Either (a)\nwaves are considered to be of the same nature as processes (temporally\nextended entities, with temporal parts), or (b)\nthey are taken as individuals of a peculiar kind. In case (a), it may\nbe argued that they do not move, for arguably processes do not move\n(Dretske 1967), but rather have phases (temporal parts) located at\ndifferent spatial regions. Although we do say that the party moved\nfrom John\u2019s room to Mary\u2019s room, the party was never fully\nin either room. Objects like people (John, Mary, Sue, Lynn), on the\nother hand, were completely in John\u2019s room first, and completely\nin Mary\u2019s room later. Objects and people moved, as movement\noccurs whenever a whole entity is fully first in a place and then in\nanother. The party did not move, but part of it was in John\u2019s\nroom and part of it in Mary\u2019s at different times.\n\nIf waves were processes like parties, one would have to construe sound\nwaves\u2019 \u201cmovement\u201d in terms of the presence of\ndifferent phases of the wave at different spatial locations. However,\none does not hear a sound wave\u2019s phase as being at a particular\nlocation, in particular at any of the locations between the source and\noneself. Sound waves do not appear to be perceptually located where\nsounds are. A wave-process has some starting phases in the object, and\nsome end-phases around the perceiver: but perception locates sounds\nwholly where the object is.\n\nIn\n case (b),\n (sound) waves are different from processes and are peculiar just\nbecause waves move, as individual substances do. But again, if sound\nwaves move, the corresponding sounds are not generally heard as\nmoving. (Contrast this case with seeing a sea wave\u2019s phase at a\nparticular place.) Sound waves propagate in all or most directions\nfrom a sounding object, but the corresponding sounds are not actually\nheard as propagating in any direction: the only moving sounds are the\nsounds emitted by a moving source. It follows that if sounds were\nsound waves in this sense, we would not be hearing them as they\nare.\n\nConsider an analogy with light. In the realm of vision, the closest\nanalogue to sounds are the activities of light sources. We perceive\nthese activities, and we perceive them as located where their sources\nare: the emission of a light bulb out there, the glowing of\ncandlelight over the table, the irradiation of the sun at the horizon;\neach with its own respective color. Do we perceive light itself, as\nopposed to the events of light emission at light sources? Clearly,\nlight travels from the source to our eye\u2014if it didn\u2019t, we\nwould not perceive the source. But what we perceive is the emission\nevent, and not the light. An irrelevant element of disanalogy is\nrelated to the temporal unfolding of sounds and light events\nrespectively. Typically in the environment light is emitted\ncontinuously, whereas sounds occur episodically and have short lives.\nIf most light sources were intermittent as in piezoelectric lighters,\nor if most objects were buzzing all the time, this element of\ndisanalogy would be less salient (Pasnau 2007).\n\nIn some conditions it looks as if we perceive light rays, e.g., in a\ndusty room. But what is actually perceived is a set of particles of\nwater or of dust that intercept light. In order for a light ray to be\nvisible, it would have to send information to our eye without the\nmediation of interposed matter. Coming back to sounds, the argument\nbased on the constraint of fidelity to the content of auditory\nperception is thus, in a compact form: in order for sound waves to be\naudible, they would have to transmit audible information that reaches\nour ears. They don\u2019t. So we do not hear them. But we do hear\nsounds. Hence sounds are not (medial) sound waves.\n2.3.3 Arguments for or against the wave theory reassessed\n\nSome other remarks against the identification of sounds with sound\nwaves in the medium between the object and the perceiver apply\nindependently of the metaphysical construal of sound waves as\nprocesses or sui generis individuals.\n\nConsider first the fact that sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes\nsoft; as we have seen, in the wave theory this feature is correlated\nwith amplitude of the sound waves. However, the location of the sound\nplays a role in establishing the correlation. A loud sound, which is\nheard as being far from us, is different from a soft sound, which is\nheard as being close to us. The spectra of the two sounds are\ndifferent. If you want a vivid example, consider what happens if you\namplify the sound of a person who is speaking low. You do not have the\nimpression of a person who speaks loud. You have, on the other hand,\nthe impression of having come very close to a low-speaking giant.\n\nIn some conditions, however, it can be difficult for us to tell a loud\nsound in the distance from a soft sound nearby, because in the part of\nspace closer to our ears the sound waves that reach us and correspond\nto the two sounds can have the same amplitude. (This only holds for an\nideal case of a long lasting sine wave with no sharp attack. This type\nof sound is practically distance-proof because having a single\ncomponent, the only possible variation is in amplitude, and no other\nspectral differences arise.)\n\nIndeed, the fact that the two sine waves have the same amplitude when\nthey are close to the ear accounts for the indistinguishability of the\ntwo sounds. Nevertheless, the two sounds, even if indistinguishable,\nare distinct, whereas the two sound waves are not. A way to put the\ndifficulty is as follows: a loud sinusoid heard at a distance is still\na loud sinusoid; but the corresponding sound waves decrease in\namplitude. As we have seen discussing proximal theories, we can make\nperfect sense of the notion of distal volume of sounds, even in the\ncase in which we cannot distinguish a loud distant sound from a soft\nsound in the vicinity. Something (decrease in amplitude) happens to\nsound waves which does not happen to sounds (the distal volume does\nnot change). Hence it can be argued that on this account too sounds\nare distinct from sound waves.\n\nAs a matter of fact, one may want to distinguish two possible lines of\nargument here:\n\nA phenomenological argument, claiming that sometimes we hear a\nconstant sound (constant in intensity, for instance), even though the\nsource is moving away from us. Here different sound waves can\ncorrespond to one and the same sound.\nA metaphysical argument, holding that sometimes the sound waves\ncorresponding to two sounds are the same while the sounds are clearly\ndifferent: a loud sound in the distance, or a faint sound close to us.\nHere the very same sound waves can correspond to distinct sounds. The\nlatter argument is not lethal, but is a useful reminder that there is\nno fully developed theory of sounds as medial sound waves as yet.\nShould the sound be identified with the sound waves when they reach\nthe ears, or with the whole train of sound waves from the source to\nour ears, or with the sphere filled with sound waves and centered on\nthe source?\n\n\nThe thesis that sounds are sound waves is also often motivated by the\nargument from vacuums. Surely, it is argued, sounds cannot exist in a\nvacuum. As Hylas says in Berkeley\u2019s Three Dialogues Between\nHylas and Philonous, \n\n\na bell struck in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, sends forth no\nsound. The air therefore must be thought the subject of sound. (1713\n[1975: 171\u2013172]) \n\n\nBut is the claim that there are no sounds in vacuums really obvious?\nOn pain of question begging, it cannot be made to follow from any\nparticular metaphysics of sounds. In order to assess it on its own\nmerits, consider once more the analogy between, on the one hand,\nsounds and air, and, on the other hand, emission events at light\nsources and light. Air is the medium of auditory perception, and light\nis the medium of visual perception. The reasoning now is that just as\nthings can sensibly be taken to have colors in the dark, they can\nsensibly be taken to produce sounds in a vacuum.\n\nIn the above arguments an important role is played by the following\nrequirement: A theory of sounds should be true to the\nphenomenological content of auditory perception. It seems quite\nreasonable to require that as sounds are the objects of hearing,\nwhatever they are should be somewhat revealed in hearing. In point of\nfact, there are two ways in which the fidelity to auditory content\nrequirement can enter the arguments. In a strong version\n(O\u2019Callaghan 2009) it may be held that no theory of sounds\n\u201cshould make the fact of location perception a wholesale\nillusion\u201d (2009: 29); hence, as sounds are represented as\nlocated, it would follow that they are correctly so represented. It\nmay be argued that this principle is too strong because it is\nunjustifiably specific. Why should location, among all possible\nfeatures of sounds, be protected against the possibility of systematic\nillusion?\n\nIn another, weaker version (Casati & Dokic 1994) it is the\nrepresentational power of auditory content that is appealed to.\nAuditory experience has the power to represent sounds, and it has the\npower to represent movement (as when one hears the sound of a moving\ntrain\u2019s whistle). It is then natural to assume that auditory\nexperience would be able to represent sounds as moving, if sounds were\nindeed moving entities by their nature. But such is not the case;\nhence auditory experience correctly represents them as firmly located.\nThis construal of the requirement is compatible with the existence of\nsystematic, though possibly selective, illusion.\n\nThe requirement of fidelity to auditory content may be challenged on a\nnumber of grounds. First, it may be challenged by opposing its\nrationale. Auditory content may well be massively illusory, and this\ncould be just the price to pay for any realist account of sounds.\n\nPossibly there is here an analogue to the case of colors, in which\nthere is room for selective illusion and for the choice between\nrealism about location, say, and realism about hue. Most arguments for\nthe subjectivity of colors start from the existence of strong\ncorrelations between phenomenal hue structures (such as the relation\nof complementarity between colors, e.g., red and green, which is\nmanifest in phenomena such as afterimages or color-blindness) and\nneural structures (such as bipolar cells). These arguments then stress\nthe absence of physical correlates for hue structure (nothing in the\nwavelengths corresponding to red and green hues can make one predict\nthe subjective complementarity between red and green). They finally\nconclude that colors are mind-dependent. However, the arguments only\nestablish the mind-dependence of hue structures, not of colors per se.\nThe location of colors as \u201coutside the brain\u201d can still be\ntaken for granted. Brought back to sounds, this form of selective\nrealism would allow for subjective tonal qualities and for an external\n(non proximal) location of sounds.\n\nSecond, the requirement of fidelity to auditory content may be\nchallenged by questioning the phenomenological claim that motivates\nit. The move would consist in suggesting that sounds do not have the\nstrong spatial property of locatedness, but the weaker property of\ndirectionality. The distinction between two senses of\n\u201clocatedness\u201d in relation to sounds can be traced back to\nMalpas (1965), based on ordinary language arguments, and is echoed in\nUrmson (1968) and Hacker (1987: 102 ff.); cf. O\u2019Shaughnessy\n(1957). Locatedness in the strong sense specifies an address for the\nsound, e.g., by specifying both directionality and distance from the\nhearer (thus including egocentrical directionality as a component), or\nby locating sounds in allocentric space (e.g., a siren from the boat\nat Pier 3). According to a weaker sense of \u201clocatedness\u201d,\nsounds would only be perceived as \u201ccoming from\u201d a certain\ndirection, without any information about the distance they travel. Now\nsurely this is not the general case. Although in some cases (e.g., the\ndecrease in amplitude of a sine wave) it may be difficult or\nimpossible to tell, say, whether what we hear is a soft sound nearby\nor a loud sound far away, in most cases the distinction is perfectly\navailable to the subject, as we noticed earlier when we introduced the\nnotion of distal volume: someone screaming in a distance is never\nconfused with someone speaking low near you ear. Indeed the issue of\nthe locatedness of sounds is the subject matter of specialized\nbranches of cognitive science (Blauert 1974; Bregman 1990; Schnupp,\nNelken, & King 2011; Grimshaw & Garner 2015).\n\nIncidentally, claiming that sounds are heard in a direction rather\nthan at a location mixes up two ways of accounting for auditory\nexperience: phenomenology on the one hand and commonsense reflections\non the directional transmission of auditory information on the other\nhand. The commonsense picture may have been made a bit too\nsophisticated by exposure to some physical accounts of sounds.\n\nFinally, the requirement of fidelity to auditory content may also be\nchallenged by proposing a different phenomenology. For example,\nKalderon (2017) argues that sound is an event that is identical to the\npropagation in every direction of a pattered disturbance by means of a\nmedium, such as air or water (2017: 105). He claims, indeed, that\nauditory phenomenology is essentially emanative phenomenology.\nAccording to emanative phenomenology, we hear sound as an\never-expanding sphere which is the medium disturbance propagating in\nevery direction from its source. Sound is like \n\n\nan expanding ripple caused by a drop in an otherwise calm body of\nwater, except that the sound event occurs in three dimensions, not\ntwo, and so takes the form of a sphere rather than a circle. (2017:.\n106) \n\n\nWhen facing the challenge of what we hear when we say we hear birds in\nthe garden outside or people in the corridor outside our\noffice\u2014which are cases in which it is clear that auditory\nphenomenology is distally locating sounds and not making us hearing\nsounds as pervading the surrounding medium\u2014Kalderon replies by\nsaying that what we hear in these cases as distally located are sound\nsources, rather than sounds (2017: 115). Nevertheless, this reply\nraises the question of how we make the distinction between hearing\nsound as located and sound sources as located. Is there a way to\ndistinguish their different location phenomenologically? Another\nquestion which might challenge the medial view based on emanative\nphenomenology is what are exactly the properties of sound sources\nwhich are audible and which provide us with spatial information on\ntheir location.\n2.3.4 Defending the wave theory: giving up fidelity to auditory content\n\nWave theorists typically give up the requirement that an account of\nsound be faithful to auditory content (although they would not\ntypically acknowledge this; as Pasnau 1999 has remarked, the very same\ntextbook on sounds may simultaneously endorse a medial, a proximal and\na distal theory). However, wave theorists may also try to reconcile\nauditory content with the wave conception. Sorensen (2008) proposes\nfor instance that it is not a purely auditory phenomenon that we do\nsometimes identify and localize objects and events at their\ncenter, whenever a center is available. For instance\nearthquakes are localized (in the epistemic sense) at their\nhypocenter, although it is admitted that they are not located\nat their hypocenter. An earthquake is everywhere it can be felt or\nmeasured. Analogously, according to the wave theorist sounds are waves\nin a medium, but they are located at their center (at their origin).\nThe wave conception considers as relatively benign the error of\nlocating a sound (i.e., a sound wave) at its center/origin.\n\nAn important dialectical limitation of Sorensen\u2019s suggestion is\nthat it does not provide us with an independent argument in favor of\nthe Wave Theory. The identification of sounds with sound waves is of\ncourse compatible with the fact that we locate sounds at a point (the\nsounding object\u2019s location) which happens to be the center of\nexpanding sound waves. However, the analogy with the localization of\nearthquakes breaks down at a crucial point. Of course, we can usefully\nidentify a certain region as the center of a particular\nearthquake. (In general, earthquakes can be localized at their\nhypocenter only when we have at least a rough representation of their\nfull extension in space.) By contrast, as Sorensen admits, the\nauditory system does not identify the sounding object\u2019s location\nas the center of expanding sound waves. Indeed, it does not\nidentify this location as the center of anything. (Compare the way the\nvisual system identifies the landing area of a stone thrown in water\nas the center of a series of concentric, expanding waves. None of the\nsort is available to the auditory system.) Now many entities other\nthan sound waves are at the object\u2019s location when we hear a\nsound, including events (monadic or relational, as we shall see\nbelow). Thus, facts about the apparent location of sounds do not\njustify the Wave Theory better than the Event Theory; quite the\ncontrary, given our other independent considerations against the\nformer approach.\n2.3.5 Source medium and environment medium\n\nSeveral among the previous remarks jointly point to the necessity of\nbetter accounting for the distinction between events in the sounding\nthing and events in the surrounding medium. As for sounds, this\ndistinction is consequent upon the distinction between two kinds of\nmedium: the source medium (that is, the stuff the thing is composed\nof) and the medium proper or environment medium, surrounding the\nsounding thing, the one in which the hearer could be immersed as well.\nLet us take them in turn. First, a thing is a sounding entity only\ninsofar the stuff or the stuffs the thing is composed of is or are\nvibrating. For a simple example, there are no properties of a tuning\nfork which account for its sounding, which are not properties of the\nstuff(s) the fork consists of (including shape). A more complex\nexample is the case of the flute, in which the \u201csounding\nobject\u201d is air inside the flute. In both cases a portion of\nmatter\u2014the source medium\u2014is vibrating.\n\nBut, second, do we ever happen to hear events in the medium? We\nactually do, but in a somewhat indirect way. Consider the visual\nrealm. In some cases both a thing and (a part of) a medium between us\nand the thing are seen. This happens when we look at things through\nirregularly warmed air, or through moving water. In these cases, we\nsee both the thing and the medium, the thing in an unclear way, and\nthe medium as that which makes the thing appear in an unclear way.\n\nBut these cases are not the norm. Perceptual media are in the norm\ncognitively transparent: they are imperceptible insofar as they\ntransmit without significant alteration information about some\nrelevant properties of the thing perceived through them. Media become\nperceivable when this transmitting function is impaired by some event\nor disturbance occurring in them. Auditorily, this occurs in the case\nof the Doppler effect. The vibration of the air carries information\nboth about the sounding object and about the effect its speed has on\nthe medium.\n\nThe affectedness of the medium is a feature which is mostly evident,\nand almost pervasive in the case of sounds, because of the relatively\nsimilar size of the phenomena involved at the source and in the medium\nproper. Vibrations in the sounding objects are macroscopic phenomena,\nof a size which is fairly comparable to the size of the sounding\nobject itself. Therefore the interaction of these vibrations with the\nsurrounding medium can easily be a source of misperception, for their\nimpact on the medium brings about processes which are of the same\norder of magnitude of the object involved.\n3. Distal Theories of Sounds\n\nAfter proximal and medial theories, one should consider another\ncandidate for the physical identification of sounds, namely distal\nproperties, processes or events in the medium inside (or at the\nsurface of) sounding objects, or in the stuff of the sounding object.\nDistal views claim their superiority to non-distal competitors in\nvirtue of their adherence to the spatial structure of auditory\ncontent. As we have seen, we do hear sounds both as externalized\n(hence auditory content is at odds with proximal views) and as\ndistally located (hence auditory content is at odds with medial\nviews).\n\nThere exist at least four varieties of the distal account of sounds:\nthe Property Theory, the Located Event Theory, the Relational Event\nTheory, and the Dispositional Theory. These accounts all subscribe to\nthe idea that sounds are distally located, but they differ in\nascribing to sounds different ontological status. Let us take them in\nturn.\n3.1 Sounds as Properties\n\nAccording to the Property View sounds are properties of material\nobjects just like colors and shapes.\n\nThe property view is in part endorsed by the founding fathers of\nmodern philosophy of perception, Galileo and Locke, who opened a\ntradition of lumping various sensory items in the class of secondary\nqualities. The typical seventeenth century list of secondary qualities\nincludes colors, smells and sounds. No significant internal\nmetaphysical differentiation is made within the class of sensory\nqualities, hence the charge of an oversimplification cannot be\ndirectly addressed to historical accounts. Other philosophers may have\nadded shapes to the list (as Berkeley did), without addressing the\nissue of the homogeneity of the class: the issue was only whether\nshapes are secondary as sounds are, not whether they are on a par with\nsounds as to their structure.\n\nThe Property View has contemporary endorsers (Pasnau 1999; although\nPasnau takes sounds to be properties like colors, he comes close to\nthe event view when he writes that sounds \u201ceither are the\nvibrations of [objects that have sounds], or supervene on those\nvibrations\u201d [1999: 316]; indeed Pasnau 2007 rejoined the Event\nTheory). Leddington (2019) also defends a property view of sound\nwithin a distal view positions, since he claims that sound itself is\nnot an event but it is a property of the event which is producing it\n(i.e., a property of the collision).\n\nThe property view faces a number of objections. First, we ordinarily\ndescribe objects as \u201chaving\u201d colors or shapes, but we do\nnot ordinarily describe sources as \u201chaving sounds\u201d.\n\nRather, we say that they make or produce sounds (conversely, a red\ntable does not \u201cproduce\u201d or \u201cmake\u201d red). This\nis an ordinary language argument, and as such it might not be very\nstrong.\n\nThe main consideration against the Property View is that it\nunderestimates the important differences between colors and shapes on\nthe one hand, and sounds on the other hand. The latter, unlike the\nformer, are dynamic dependent individuals. And even if colors and\nshapes can be theoretically conceived as individuals, they are not\ndynamic. Sounds take up time. They start and cease. They are\nintrinsically temporal entities. Their temporal profile is essential\nto individuating them, in a way which has no analogue in the case of\ncolors and shapes. However, Roberts (2017) explicitly defends the\nProperty View by discussing salient disanalogies between sound and\ncolors. He also suggests a very exhaustive taxonomy of the different\npositions available within the property view space. Cohen (2010),\nalthough not directly endorsing the property view, criticizes\narguments that conclude to an asymmetry between sounds and colors, in\nparticular with regard to temporality.\n\nDi Bona and Santarcangelo (2018: chapter 4) discuss to a certain\nlength the relationship between sound and time, especially when this\nrelationship grounds a metaphysical difference between sounds and\ncolors. They investigate different temporal experiences of sounds and\nconclude that temporal experiences of sounds are similar to some\ntemporal experiences of colors. Sounds and colors differ with regard\nto temporality only insofar as one focuses on the role that time plays\nwhen the auditory system has to segregate auditory stimuli into\nauditory streams (Bregman 1990). When segregating colors, space is far\nmore important than time. For a discussion of vision and audition with\nregard not only to sounds and colors but also to auditory and visual\nobjects and always with relation to spatiality and temporality (see\nO\u2019Callaghan 2008; Kubovy & Schutz 2010; and Di Bona &\nSantarcangelo 2017).\n3.2 Sounds as Located Events\n\nIn this and the following section, we shall present two Event Theories\nof sounds, for which we use two distinct labels. An earlier one, The\nLocated Event Theory, was defended by Casati and Dokic (1994). It has\nbeen rejoined by Pasnau (2009) and extended to the field of sonic art\nby Roden (2010). A second, more recent version, the Relational Event\nTheory, has received an articulated defense by O\u2019Callaghan\n(2007, 2010a). The two accounts agree on categorizing sounds as\nevents, that is, located temporal particulars, and diverge on some\nspecifics of the class of particulars that are admitted to be sounds.\nThe Relational Event Theory makes sounds depend upon the existence of\na medium that carries information about them. In this sense, only a\nsubclass of situations involving sounds for the Located Event Theory\nare situations involving sounds for the Relational Event Theory.\n3.2.1 The located event theory\n\nAccording to the Located Event Theory, sounds are events happening to\nmaterial objects. They are located at their source, and are identical\nwith, or at least supervene on, vibration processes in the source. On\nthis view (Casati & Dokic 1994), auditory perception of sounds\nrequires a medium which transmits information from the vibrating\nobject to the ears; however, the transmitting medium is not essential\nto the existence of sounds. One can see at once the fit of this view\nwith those features of sound which were sources of trouble in the\ncases discussed above when criticizing proximal and medial\ntheories.\n\nVibration processes in the sounding object do not move any more\nthan sounds appear to.\nThey do not propagate from the object, as much as sounds do not\nappear to.\nDistal volume is constant: Like sounds, and unlike sound waves in\nthe ambient medium, the intensity of vibration processes can remain\nthe same through a period of time, even if one distances oneself from\nthe source and hence hears them as less loud.\nFinally, and most importantly, tuning-forks and other sounding\nobjects can be taken as continuing to vibrate irrespective of their\nbeing or not being immersed in a vibrating medium. One does not create\nsounds by surrounding vibrating objects with a medium\u2014one simply\nreveals them.\n\n\nA by-product of the Located Event Theory is that it makes plain what\ncategory sounds belong to, as opposed to views that construe sounds\ngenerically as qualities. Sounds are either instantaneous events or\ntemporally extended processes. They start and cease. They are\nintrinsically temporal entities.\n\nAnother feature of the Located Event Theory is that it provides us\nwith a clear example of the compatibility of a theory of non-direct\nperception, according to which we hear external events by hearing\ntheir perceptual deputies, with a non-phenomenalistic theory,\naccording to which perceptual deputies are not mental items. The case\nof sound perception shows that there can be indirect perception\nwithout mental deputies. We hear coaches and telephones by hearing\ntheir sounds, i.e., by hearing some (cluster of) vibratory processes\nor events occurring in those objects. Sounds are both physical events\nand perceptual deputies.\n3.2.2 Objections to the located event theory\n\nWe shall now briefly discuss some objections to the identification\nproposed by the Located Event Theory, as they allow us to highlight\ncertain metaphysically interesting features of sounds.\nImprecise Location and Echoes\n\nThe first objection concerns sound location. Even if sounds are heard\nas located, it could be held that location is often imprecise or even\nerroneous, this in turn depending on\u2014and being explained\nby\u2014the nature of sound waves. Here is a relatively common echo\nexample. Suppose you walk under the rain, your umbrella open. At some\npoint you enter a building with a glass roof. Rain drops on the roof,\nand no longer on your umbrella. The umbrella attenuates the noise from\nthe roof, which is reflected by the ground. You hear the raindrops as\nif they were below you, and not above you. Erroneous location is here\nexplained by the path of sound waves.\n\nThe temptation of identifying sounds with sound waves can arise\nbecause of this fact: that sounds can be mislocated in audition. They\ncan be heard as located in a region which is larger than, or removed\nfrom, the one occupied by a sounding object, a region which it is\nreasonable to take as being occupied by sound waves.\n\nThis example poses no particular threat to the distal view. Consider\nagain a visual analogy. Seeing an object in a mirror is not seeing\nanother, immaterial object located in an immaterial space beyond the\nmirror-plane. There is no such immaterial object; we see one and the\nonly material object, and we locate it incorrectly as if it was behind\nthe mirror.\n\nThe mirror sophism should be credited to Hobbes\u2019\nLeviathan (1651: I, I; cf. Casati & Dokic 1994:\n49\u201351), which explicitly linked perception in a mirror and\nperception of echoes:\n\n\nThe cause of sense, is the external body, or object, which presseth\nthe organ proper to each sense, either immediately, as in the taste\nand touch; or mediately, as in seeing, hearing, and smelling; which\npressure, by the mediation of the nerves, and other strings and\nmembranes of the body, continued inwards to the brain and hearth,\ncauseth there a resistance, or counter-pressure, or endeavour of the\nearth to deliver itself, which endeavour, because outward, seemeth to\nbe some matter without. And this seeming, or fancy, is that which men\ncall sense; and consisteth, as to the eye, in a light, or colour\nfigured; to the ear, in a sound\u2026if those colours and sounds\nwere in the bodies, or objects that cause them, they could not severed\nby them, as by glasses, and in echoes by reflection, we see they are;\nwhere we know the thing we see is in one place, the appearance in\nanother.\n\n\nThe deviant paths of sound waves (in echoes) is responsible for the\nperceptual difficulty in locating sounds, much as the deviant path of\nlight rays (in mirrors) is responsible for the analogous difficulty\nfor visible objects (Casati & Dokic 1994; see also\nO\u2019Callaghan 2007 for a lengthy discussion of echoes, and Fowler\n2013 for arguments against O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s view). But it is\nnot the case that sound waves are sounds just because of their\nresponsibility. From the fact that a subject hears something as\nimperfectly located, it does not follow that she hears something which\nis imperfectly located.\nDoppler Effect\n\nThe second objection concerns typical acoustical effects, like the\nDoppler effect, which are perfectly accounted for by appealing to\n(medial) sound waves. The Doppler effect is a shift in frequency of\nthe sound heard by an observer who moves relative to the sound source.\nAs waves in the direction of movement are compressed, and waves in the\nopposite direction are expanded, the frequency drops dramatically when\nthe hearer and the source go past each other. Such explanations of the\nDoppler effect are harmless for a distal account. The Doppler effect\nis dependent on something going on in the medium, but this should not\nallow one to conclude that what we hear are sound waves in the medium.\nThe situation can be described as follows in a way that is relatively\nuncommitting: When we hear sounds as undergoing the Doppler effect, we\ndo not hear anything different from a vibration process in a sounding\nobject, a process which is heard in a sort of perspectival shortening\nbecause the movement of the sounding object causes, among other\nthings, the Doppler effect.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the objection could be turned on its head. On a\ntrain passing by, a trumpet player is delivering a concert. According\nto the distal view, the melody does not change, it is just perceived\nas changing. If we repeated the experience a number of times, we would\nfind it suspect that the melody\u2019s key drops only when the train\npasses by. Surely, we would infer, there is something wrong with the\nmedium that blocks our perception of the true melody. And surely the\ntrain passengers would disconfirm our impression: they do not hear any\nkey drop. The medial theory here indeed predicts that there are two\nmelodies, the one that we hear from the platform, and the one the\npassengers hear.\nProperties of Sounds\n\nA third objection is as follows. \n\n\nSounds are phenomenologically high or low (they have high or low\npitch). But processes in objects cannot be high or low. Therefore\nsounds are not processes in objects. \n\n\nThis can be answered in the following way. Notice first that sound\nwaves fare no better on this objection\u2014they cannot literally be\nsaid to be high or low. But a more substantial answer is available.\nWhat one needs is a way of systematically correlating predicates like\n\u201c\u2026is high\u201d, \u201c\u2026is higher\nthan\u2026\u201d to processes in sounding objects. It is likely\nthat a high sound corresponds to a quickly vibrating process, and so\nforth.\nThe Causal Link\n\nA fourth objection has it that \n\n\nsurely there are sound waves in the ambient medium, otherwise no\ncausal link could be set between the sounding object and our\nperception of the latter. \n\n\nAnd such sound waves can certainly be measured and physically\ndescribed. Now there is no point in denying that there are sound waves\nin the ambient medium: of course there are, and they are causally\nresponsible for our aural perceptions when these are perceptions of\nanything at all. A defender of the Located Event Theory ought to just\ncontend that such sound waves are not what we hear.\n\nConsider an analogy we discussed before. Light is causally responsible\nfor your perception of an object\u2019s surface. But this does not\nmake you see the light when you see the surface. We can see\nluminescent sources, but never light in itself: in order to be seen,\nlight should have to emit light carrying information about it.\nSpace Filling Sounds?\n\nFinally, another objection concerns the alleged meaningful use of\nexpressions such \u201cthe sound fills the room\u201d, \u201csounds\nfill the room\u201d. It seems that what makes these sentences true is\nbest found in the spreading of sound waves, which could actually be\neverywhere in the room. But one should not be too much impressed by\nidioms. \u201cThe sound fills the room\u201d does not describe any\nphenomenological fact which is different from the fact that the sound\nis audible from any place in the room (in this respect sounds are\nunlike fog, which can literally be seen to fill a room).\n\nHowever, this point deserves closer attention. For sometimes sounds do\nseem to fill space. Thunders seem to. This is a case in which the only\nvibrating entity is the medium. Nonetheless this case too can be\naccommodated by the Located Event Theory: what we hear is sudden\nheating of air due to the electric discharge, whose impact is\nconfusedly propagated by the medium. A portion of air (the portion\nthat is suddenly heated up) is the vibrating object and another\nportion is the transmitting medium.\n3.2.3 The relational event theory\n\nAccording to the Relational Event Theory, sounds are events which\ninvolve both the source and the surrounding medium. They are\nrelational rather than \u201cmonadic\u201d events. (The distinction\nbetween monadic and relational events is not to be taken as cast in\niron, since the latter can be reduced to the former by making the\nmereological sum of sources and surrounding medium the subject of\nsounds.) O\u2019Callaghan (2002, 2007) has developed such a view at\nsome length. He notes that the wave conception of sounds is not the\nonly possible interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s remarks about sounds\nin On the Soul. Aristotle writes that \u201ceverything that\nmakes a sound does so by the impact of something against something\nelse, across a space filled with air\u201d (De Anima II.8\n420b15). On O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s view, what Aristotle might have\nmeant is that the sound itself is not a movement of the air, it is\nrather the event in which a vibrating object disturbs a surrounding\nmedium and sets it \u201cmoving\u201d. Waves in the medium are not\nthe sounds themselves, but rather the effects of sounds. According to\nthe Relational Event Theory, sounds are \u201cdisturbings\u201d of a\nmedium, hence depend existentially on a medium that is disturbed and\nthat will transmit information to a listener. This account differs\nfrom the Located Event Theory insofar as the latter allows for sounds\nthat exist in a vacuum, and thus distinguishes between a medium that\nhosts the vibration and a medium that transmits the vibration.\n\nThe Relational Event Theory shares with medial theories an endorsement\nof Berkeley\u2019s argument that sounds do not exist in a vacuum. It\nis, in point of fact, a hybrid theory (O\u2019Callaghan 2007: 55),\nsharing with medial theories the tenet of the indispensability of a\nmedium to the existence of a sound.\n\nAn argument against the Relational Event Theory capitalizes upon the\nfact that we have the conceptual resources to distinguish between not\nhearing a sound because the sounding object is no longer resonating\nand not hearing it because we do not have informational access to the\nsounding object anymore. The Relational Event theory faces the risk of\ncollapsing unto a medial position.\n\nTo develop this line of thought and make it vivid, imagine a vacuum\njar which has the property of immediately creating a vacuum upon\nclosing the lid, and of immediately recalling air upon opening the\nlid. Take now a sounding object like a tuning fork at 440Hz and have\nit vibrate, supposing that the vibration fades and becomes inaudible\nafter 10 seconds. What you hear is an A that becomes feebler and\nfeebler until it disappears. Now, place the tuning fork inside the\njar, have it vibrate as before, and repeatedly open-and-close the lid\nof the jar, say once in a bit less than a second. What do you hear?\nYou may have the feeling that a few short sounds, each feebler than\nthe preceding one, come into existence and pass away. But you may as\nwell have the impression of a sound that is revealed by the\nopening and closing of the jar. Indeed, the fading of the sound should\nbe audible from each \u201cwindow\u201d to the next, implying that\nthere is a single sound that fades. If sounds were either sound waves\nin the medium surrounding the object, or items dependent on the medium\nas per the Relational Event Theory, we would be forced to admit that\nthe tuning-fork started and ceased to sound; because the relevant\nsound waves would not be present in the surrounding medium. Only the\nfirst impression, that of a series of short sounds, would be accounted\nfor. But the second impression, that of a continuous underlying sound\nthat is revealed, is supported too. A visual analogue of this would be\nthe perception of an object in the dark, on which light is shed at\nintervals. We would not have the impression that the object gets its\ncolors and then loses them at intervals.\n\nAn advantage of the Relational Event Theory over the Located Event\nTheory is that the former provides a criterion for specifying which\namong vibratory events at a source are sounds, namely, those that\ncreate medial disturbances that are (or can be) heard. The Located\nEvent Theorist can, on the one hand, observe that the minimal\nrequirement of a metaphysics of sounds is to specify which type of\nentities are sounds, and not, more specifically, which, among entities\nof that type, are sounds. Thus she would claim that sounds are events\nat a source, without caring to discuss whether some events at a source\nare not sounds. On the other hand, she can observe that too much\nfine-grained a classification would create a problem with those events\nthat share with sounds all interesting metaphysical properties except\nfor the property of being audible; a problem which, incidentally,\naffects a number of physicalist reductions of sounds.\n3.2.4 Discussing the located event theory and the relational event theory\nRelation between sound and sound source\n\nThe Relational Event Theory and the Located Event Theory differ\nconcerning the way in which they account for the audible relationship\nbetween sound and sound source. A manner of characterizing this\nrelation within the Relational Event Theory is the part-whole\nrelationship, according to which sounds are heard as the constituent\nparts of wholes that are everyday audible events (O\u2019Callaghan\n2011a, 2011b). This is a Mereological View, which presupposes a\ndistinction between sound and the broad event which sound is part of.\nThe parthood relationship explains a striking and quite ambiguous\naspect of audition, namely, the fact for which we hear the sound and\nits source as two different events but, at the same time, we hear them\nas not wholly distinct.\n\nThe advantages of the Mereological View over both the Property\nInstantiation view\u2014which claims that sound is heard as a\nproperty of the sounding object\u2014and the Causal View\u2014for\nwhich sound is heard as the effect of its source (O\u2019Callaghan\n2011a: 383 and following)\u2014are that:\n\nIt explains why we often perceive sound as part of a multipartite\noccurrence which might also involve inaudible features. For\nO\u2019Callaghan, there might be features of the event source that\nare not features of sound, and we may hear the sound without\nperceiving the features of the event source. For instance, the\nhappening of \u201cthe stomping of the foot\u201d (2011a: 396)\nincludes non-audible features like a foot stomping or a release of\nenergy, but also something that we hear, a sound.\nMereology explains the intuitive fact that sounds may usually seem\nto be heard as bound or unified with their\nsources.\nParthood explains the classical Berkeleyan account of auditory\nperception for which sound sources are perceived by virtue of the\nperception of the sounds they make.\n\n\nThe Located Event Theory proposes a metaphysical Ockhamization of the\nMereological View (Casati, Di Bona, & Dokic 2013), which cleans\nthe metaphysical landscape up from entities which are not necessary.\nAs a starting point, it is useful to distinguish between two\ncomponents of sound sources: thing sources (such as keys or\nmusical instruments) and event sources (such as collisions or\nvibratory events at the sounding object) (2013: 462). The Located\nEvent Theory maintains an Identity View for which sound, instead of\nbeing a proper part of a distinct event that is its source, is\nidentical with the event source. That is, the collision we hear\nis the sound we hear. The Identity View appears to simplify\nthe metaphysical landscape depicted by the Mereological View (2013:\n463). The metaphysical claim which grounds the Identity View is\nsupported by considerations about the phenomenology of audition. These\nconsiderations suggests that we do not commonly hear sounds as part of\nlarger events\u2014at least when, with \u201clarger events\u201d,\nwe refer to event sources. We hear sounds as a unified entity, and not\nas parts of larger events. The biggest price the Identity View has to\npay is for some ordinary language statements to which we have to\nrenounce, meaning that instead of saying \u201cI heard the bang\n(produced by/and) the collision\u201d, it would be more appropriate\nto say that we heard the collision. This is a disadvantage of the\ntheory which is acceptable, though, if the advantage is to propose a\nplausible theory of sound (2013: 465).\n\nAs for the advantages that the Mereological View has over the Property\nView and the Causal View, the Identity View can account for them as\nwell. One of the advantages of the Mereological View is that it\njustifies the supposedly different properties that we usually\nattribute to sounds and to sound sources. The Identity View responds\nto this by arguing that:\n\nThese differences in the attributable properties are only\napparent. We are tempted to introduce this distinction since it seems\nthat we ascribe properties to the source and not to sound because of\nthe non-auditory character of these non-audible properties. But the\nIdentity View claims that from the fact that some features\u2014such\nas the release of energy, vibrations, a painful sensation\u2014are\nperceivable through other sense modalities, it does not follow that\nsuch properties are not features of sounds themselves (2013: 464).\nMoreover, the extra-properties, if any, can be perfectly ascribed to\nthe thing source.\n The sense of unification we experience when we hear bangs and\ncollisions can perfectly be explained in terms of identity.\n Then Mereological View would explain the Berkeleyan claim for\nwhich we hear the source by virtue of hearing the sound since one\nperceives a whole by virtue of perceiving its parts. The Identity View\nas well accounts for the Berkeleyan claim since it states that,\nbecause the immediate object of auditory perception is just the event\nthat is the sound, then, the latter is the thing source we perceive\nindirectly by virtue of hearing a sound.\n\n\nThe Identity View and the Mereological View have an equal explanatory\ncapacity, but the Identity View, in addition to the metaphysical\nreduction, seems to untangle the ambiguity of hearing sound and sound\nsources as two different events and, at the same time, of hearing them\nas not wholly distinct. This ambiguity evaporates if we\nidentify sound with the event source.\n\nDifferent options concerning the relationship between sound and sound\nsources and how we perceive them have been proposed. According to\nMatthen (2010) both sounds (and sound composites like melodies,\nharmonies or sequences of phonemes) and sound sources can be heard\ndirectly. Leddington supports the Heideggerian view of hearing, for\nwhich we \u201chear sound sources directly, in hearing the sounds\nthey make\u2014not, \u00e0 la Berkeley, merely in virtue\nof hearing those sounds\u201d (2014: 340). Nudds, instead, suggests\nthat when listening to sounds we hear them as apparently being\nproduced by the same source (2010a, 2010b). He suggests that\nwe can also perceive the production of sound bi-modally: by\nsimultaneously listening to and seeing the cause of sound (2001).\n\nNevertheless, issues about the relationship between sound and the\nthing source (namely, sound and the material object which produces it)\nand about how we hear both the objects that produce sounds, and the\nrelation between objects and sounds still have to be fully worked out\nwithin both views. As a starting point to develop an account on the\nperception of sound sources or, at least, of some aspects of the thing\nsource, Di Bona (2017) proposes an argument for the perception of a\nspecific characteristic of human voices. She offers an account of how\na certain feature of the sound source when the source is the human\nvoice is perceivable. Di Bona focuses on gender and engages with the\ndebate on the admissible content of auditory experience, which has\nbeen mostly developed within the field of visual perception, and\nargues for a \u201crich\u201d view of the auditory experience. This\nview is defended by means of the method of contrast applied to a case\nof auditory adaptation to human voices. The idea is that we hear not\nonly the low-level auditory properties of pitch, timbre, and loudness\nbut also the high-level property of gender, that is, the property\ncommonly referred to as being a female voice or a male voice. This\nhigh-level property displays adaptational effects and, given that\ndisplaying these effects for a property is a clear mark that this\nproperty is perceivable, then we can conclude we hear gender\nproperties instantiated by human voices. O\u2019Callaghan (2011b)\nalso engages with the debate on the admissible content of auditory\nperception, endorsing a more restricted view on the content of\naudition. He focuses on speech perception and argues that we do not\nhear the semantic properties of voices (which can also be seen as\nproperties of sound sources, of voices) since what is auditory\nperceivable are, instead, the phonological properties.\nSome objections to both event theories\n\nSoteriou (2018) claims that both versions of the event theory are too\nstrict about what they count as sounds: the Located Event Theory\ncounts as sounds only monadic events happening at material objects;\nthe Relational Event Theory, instead, admits only relational events\nthat are bearers of acoustic properties. Soteriou challenges the\nassumption that sounds are one kind of thing and suggests that the\nsounds we hear are both pure audibilia (such as the barking\nof a dog), which are events or act-types bearing acoustic properties\nthat can also be disconnected from their material causes and cannot\nexist in a vacuum, and events or act-types that can lack acoustic\nproperties (footsteps), which are perceivable by means of modalities\nthat are different from audition, and can exist in a vacuum.\nSoteriou\u2019s \u201csimple view\u201d or \u201ccatholic\nview\u201d (2018: 48) moves from the necessity of rejecting the idea\nof considering the experiences of echoes and recorded sounds as\nillusory experiences or distortion of space and time, which is how he\nthinks both event theories regard them in order to be consistent. The\nevent theories classify the experiences of echoes and recorded sounds\nas illusory for the sake of preserving the idea that, usually, sounds\nare the bearers of acoustic properties located where we experience\nthem to be located, namely distally. That is because if sound is\nsomething located at its own source and the echo seems to be a sound\nnot perceived at its source, then we are hallucinating a sound. When\nhearing recorded sound, we experience and illusion since the bearer of\nthe acoustic properties that we actually hear to be distally located\nis distinct from the \u201coriginal\u201d bearer of acoustic\nproperties (2018: 44). Soteriou suggests that when hearing echoes or\nrecorded sounds, even though we do not hear event-like individuals\ndistally located, we do not have an illusory experience since what we\nhear are pure audibilia. Soteriou\u2019s proposal has the\nmerit of broadening up the range of the audible, but it might\nencounter some worries because of the non-univocal characterization of\nwhat sounds are. For example, a challenge to this view is to explain,\non the one hand, how pure audibila are connected to the\nphysical causes and, on the other hand, how collisions or non-audible\nact-types \u201cacquire\u201d acoustic properties that make them\naudible.\n\nNudds (2018) challenges both event theories by virtue of \u201cthe\nargument from the medium\u201d which is elaborated to show that\nenvironmental events are not the bearers of acoustic features (2018:\n54). The main premise of the argument, the existence premise, states\nthat we can hear a sound without the occurrence of an environmental\nevent. This premise can be used against both event theories, which\nclaim that sounds are either identical to environmental events or to\nparts of such events (2018: 67). Nudds imagines two situations, S1 and\nS2. In S1 there is a disturbance of the medium and an environmental\nevent, such as a collision; S2 is just like S1 except for the fact\nthat the disturbance of the medium takes place without that there is\nan environmental event. In both situations you hear a sound, but in S2\nthere is not any environmental event; therefore, it is possible to\nhave a sound and its acoustic features without the happening of an\nenvironmental event. In order to check whether this conclusion is\ntrue, Nudds elaborates an analogous case within vision and concludes\nthat while there are two different arguments to show that the premise\nis false in vision, none of them apply also to the auditory case. He\nasks to imagine to have the situation S3 in which you see a red cube,\nand the situation S4 in which we keep the same pattern of light which\ndetermine the appearance of a red cube in S3, except for the fact that\nthere is no red cube. The arguments to show that the premise is false\nin the visual case are as follows.\n\n(1) The premise is false since you cannot see a red cube without that\nthere is something, a real thing, that is the bearer of the visual\nfeatures that usually a red cube has. When it seems to you that you\nare seeing a red cube without that there actually is a red cube, it is\nbecause you are hallucinating it: there is nothing that instantiates\nthe visual features of a real red cube. Can we apply the same\nreasoning to audition in order to claim that the premise is false\nconcerning auditory appearances too? When hearing a sound in S2, you\ndo not hallucinate the sound of a collision since you can perfectly\nhear a sound without that there is a collision, as when listening to\nmusic played by loudspeakers. Therefore, there is still something that\nis the bearer of auditory qualities that you hear in S2 which can be\nproduced, for example, by loudspeakers and you are clearly not having\na hallucination (Nudds 2018: 56). That is to say that while it seems\nthat, in the visual case, we hallucinate, in the auditory case we are\nclearly hearing a sound, and we can conclude that the premise is true\nin audition. Nudds\u2019 conclusion can be challenged by the event\nview since one can say that an environmental event is still present in\nS2, that is, the event involved in the mechanics responsible for the\nfunctioning of the loudspeaker. Therefore, the premise is false in the\nauditory case as well, but for a different reason: not because you are\nhallucinating a sound, but because the loudspeaker case does not show\nthat you hear sound in the absence of an environmental event.\n\n(2) Nudds (2018: 56) adds that the falsity of the existence premise in\nthe visual case can be showed also by imagining to see a hologram in\nS4. If what you see when it seems to you that you see a red cube is a\nhologram of a red cube\u2014that is, you have the experience of\nseeing something that is indistinguishable from seeing a real red\ncube\u2014you don\u2019t literally see the object, but you do not\nhallucinate it as well. When seeing a hologram of a red cube, you see\nsomething which is the bearer of visual qualities without that the\nactual object having these visual features is present. Starting from\nMartin\u2019s (2012) discussion of visual images, according to which\na hologram is the appearance of an object \u201cin the absence of any\nobject which might possess it\u201d (2012: 339), Nudds concludes that\na hologram presents the appearance of something that it does not\ninstantiate. Therefore, the existence premise is false not because you\nliterally see nothing in S4, as usually happens in hallucinations, but\nbecause what you see is not the bearer of visual features; and yet it\nis indistinguishable from a real red cube. Is there a similar case in\naudition which can be used in order to show that the existence premise\nis false? Given that auditory holograms do not seem to exist, namely,\n\u201csomething that presents the acoustic appearance of a\nsound-producing event, an appearance it does not itself\ninstantiate\u201d (2018: 58), it is difficult to claim that the\nexistence premise is false in audition for the same reasons for which\nit is false in vision; therefore, Nudds concludes that the existence\npremise is true: environmental events are not the bearers of acoustic\nfeatures. This conclusion is based on the debatable notions of\nauditory hologram and auditory \u201cimage\u201d. Is it really\nlegitimate to look for analogous auditory concepts for notions that\nare authentically visual? Important questions that are triggered by\nNudds\u2019 argument are: how far we can go with the analogy between\nvision and audition, and how admissible is to ground our reasoning on\nthe analogy between the two sensory modalities especially when dealing\nwith items so intrinsically visual, such as holograms and images?\n3.3 The Dispositional View\n\nThere are yet other ways to construe sounds under the distal umbrella.\nAccording to dispositional account of sounds, \n\n\nsounds are dispositions of objects to vibrate in response to being\nstimulated. Sounds are perceived transiently, but they are not\nperceived as being transient and they are not in fact transient.\n(Kulvicki 2008: 2) \n\n\nThe account takes Pasnau\u2019s original insight that sounds be\nconsidered as akin to colors in their being located features of\nobjects. Indeed, Kulvicki draws a set of analogies between sounds and\ncolors based on the assumption that colors are dispositions to reflect\nlight in a certain manner. The analogies include the fact that as\ncolors exist in the dark (being dispositions) sounds exist in the\nvacuum, and that as light waves are a way to get knowledge of colors,\ncompression waves in a medium are a way to get knowledge of sounds. To\ncomplete the analogy, as \u201ccolors give off light when stimulated\nby light, objects in a medium give off compression waves when they are\nthwacked\u201d (2008: 4). More controversially, \u201cWithout\nvibrating, objects have sounds, but these sounds cannot be\nheard\u201d (2008: 4). Thwacking is the key element in the\ndispositional proposal. Thwacking reveals sounds. A good\nthwack (an impulse that contains all relevant frequencies) is\nconsidered to be to sounds what white light is to colors. White light\ncontains waves of all lengths in roughly the same proportion and thus\nsamples adequately the dispositions of the object to reflect some of\nthem. If you lit up a surface with a monochromatic laser beam at\n500nm, the disposition the surface may have to reflect light of 600nm\nwill not be revealed. A good thwack makes the object resonate at all\nfrequencies and thus reveals the vibratory modes of an object by\nstimulating it at the frequencies at which it responds better.\n\nThe impulse proposal solves an alleged disanalogy between color and\nsound, i.e., the absence of a normative analogue of white light in the\ncase of sounds (O\u2019Callaghan 2007). White light is normatively\nsignificant for revealing colors; a good impulse is normatively\nsignificant for revealing a sounding disposition.\n\nKulvicki\u2019s dispositional theory neatly accounts for some distal\nintuitions about sounds. (Other intuitions, such as the idea that\nsound have a loudness, are beyond the descriptive power of the theory,\nthat on that score considers loudness as a property not of the sound,\nbut of the thwack). In particular it highlights the importance of\naction in bringing about auditory information about an object: most\nobjects sound because we deliberately impart a thwack on them, and in\nmany cases in which we want to know how an object sounds, we do impart\nthe thwack, and subtly modulate it. When we hear a sound we get\nknowledge of a kind of resistance an object opposes to thwacking; it\nis knowledge of an elastic disposition. The account explains the fact\nthat the more the object reacts, the more it is sonorous. And an\nobject\u2014say, a guitar string\u2014is \u201cA sharp\u201d\nbecause at that frequency it responds optimally to thwacking.\n\nKulvicki\u2019s alleges that an analysis of the phenomenon of sound\nconstancy, modeled on an analogue to color constancy, militates in\nfavor of the dispositional view. Colors are notoriously resilient to\nmany changes of illumination, and even when incident light composition\nis very distant from standard light, surfaces may be seen as having\ntheir standard color. \u201cThe green grass looks green in the orange\nlight at dusk, but it looks like green grass illuminated oddly\u201d\n(Kulvicki 2008: 9). This is in sync with the likely function of\nvision\u2014to inform about distal, stable properties of surfaces.\nAnalogously, Kulvicki claims, \u201cobjects sound roughly the same\nwhether it is white noise [i.e., an impulse] or something reasonably\nfar from it that stimulates them\u201d (2008: 9). Our ability to\nrecognize voices across a large variation of ways to produce them is a\ncase in point. In general, humans are able to identify sounds in terms\nof their spectral slopes and spectral envelope patterns, which are\n\u201cfairly constant across changes in the fundamental frequency\nproduced by the vocal chords\u201d (2008: 10). Now, it can be\nobjected that voices are but a part of the auditory world, and they\nare the object of dedicated neural machinery. More generally, however,\nsound constancy is exhibited in hearing objects of various sorts. \n\n\nThere is no obvious reason the auditory system should exhibit\nconstancy for something like spectral slope or envelope pattern,\nunless the auditory system has the function of identifying stable\nproperties of objects. (2008: 10) \n\n\nFacts of auditory constancy thus help out the dispositional theory\ninsofar as the function of the auditory system is to find out whatever\nstable property of the environment is heard as being indeed\nconstant.\nObjections to the dispositional theory\n\nWe shall enlist two objections to the dispositional account.\n\nA first problem with the dispositional account is that of specifying\nwhat precisely the disposition in question is. An object\u2019s\ndisposition to vibrate at its natural frequencies does not exhaust the\npossibilities. \n\n\nWhen struck, an object vibrates in an odd but characteristic fashion\nfor a brief time before it settles into vibrating at its natural\nfrequencies, if it has any. Like natural frequencies, these attack\npatterns are relatively stable dispositions of objects to vibrate when\nthwacked. Similarly, objects\u2019 vibrations decay\ncharacteristically. Attacks and decays are stable dispositions of\nobjects to vibrate when thwacked, just as natural frequencies of\nvibration are. (Kulvicki 2008: 14)\n\n\nHence there are three dispositions (at least) here: a disposition to\nreact in the attack mode, a disposition to react in the decay mode, a\ndisposition to vibrate in a certain way. There are many more. For\ninstance, a disposition to respond by emitting a certain pattern of\nwaves when rubbed or when brushed; or when broken. Many are the\ndispositions, and the dispositional account should endorse the idea\nthat many are the (possibly unheard) sounds here. Call this the\nmany-disposition problem.\n\nNormativity half-solves the many-disposition problem. Some ways of\nimparting energy to an object are more telling than others. By\ncontrast, light is the sole \u201cthwacker\u201d for colors (modulo\ndifferences in intensity and light spectrum), but there are many\ntwhackers for eliciting the sonority of an object. The dispositional\ntheory of colors suffers from some variant of the many-disposition\nproblem. The color of many objects and stuff depends on their\ntemperature. At 1000 \u00b0C, iron glows. At \u221220 \u00b0C, water is\nwhite.\n\nA different problem for the dispositional theory is: What are those\nindividuals that we hear when the object sounds? The main problem a\ndispositional account of sounds has to face is that even if we accept\nthat sounds are sound dispositions, there appear prima facie to exist,\non top of those dispositions, the individual, occurrent\nsounds\u2014those that last when the disposition is realized. (A\nsimilar problem plagued Chisholm\u2019s account of events as\nrepeatable entities: as Davidson pointed out, any such account should\naccommodate the problem of assigning a status to the single\noccurrences of the repetitions, which cannot be themselves repeatable\nitems.) Indeed, as Kulvicki notes,\u201cnow and again one encounters\nobjects making sounds they do not have\u201d (2008: 8); he dismisses\nthese encounters as rather exceptional, but no matter their\nfrequency\u2014and radio listening provides a very common\nexample\u2014the \u201csound made\u201d, as distinct from the\n\u201csound had\u201d, must be accommodated by any theory of sounds.\nKulvicki addresses the problem in a general way, by distinguishing\nbetween sounds as dispositions and the hearings of sounds. There are\nno individual sounds, only episodes of hearing the dispositional\nsounds. We do hear sounds, these are the dispositions, but the\nimpression that sounds last depends on the fact that our hearing\nepisodes last.\n\nKulvicki denies that this account entails an error theory because he\nthinks that intuitions are not particularly telling about the\ndistinction between hearing as an individual event and hearing a\nsound. However, a threefold distinction should apply here. Grant the\ndispositional sound. Grant hearing episodes. Now, the duration of a\nhearing episode is different from the duration of an occurrent sound.\nYou set a tuning fork in motion. It vibrates for thirty seconds. But\nthen, after ten seconds, you get bored and block your ears with your\nhand. The duration of your hearing is ten seconds. But the sound is\nstill there, for another twenty seconds. Generally speaking, unheard\nsounds are accounted for in the dispositional theory only as\nunrealized dispositions. Occurrent unheard sounds are invisible to the\ndispositional account.\n\nKulvicki answers this objection by saying that this phenomenon is\nconsistent with the dispositional view (2014: 218). In order to have\nsounds, it is required that the dispositions of an object to vibrate\nin a certain way are realized, that these dispositions generate waves\nin a medium, and that ears can detect these waves. Occurrent unheard\nsounds produced when you block your ears and do not hear the tuning\nfork vibrating for thirty seconds are not a problem simply because\nthey are not sounds. For the dispositional view \u201csounds are not\noccurrent anythings: they are qualities\u201d (2014: 218). But the\nquestions that naturally arise and need to be answered are: if the\nunheard dispositions are not sounds, what are they? Moreover,\nimagining that when I am still blocking my ears with my hand, someone\nelse is there listening to the tuning fork, would she be listening to\nsounds? What are the items she would be listening to?\n\nAnother critical point of the dispositional view is that it does not\ntake into account the intuitive fact that sounds are heard as\nunfolding over time and as having a duration, which is a clear sign of\ntheir being an event. Kulvicki (2014: 211) discusses this by\nelaborating on the plausibility of the argument of \u201cperceptual\nseeming\u201d that he attributes to the people who claim that sounds\nare events. The argument is based on the commonsensical idea for which\nif sound appears to have a duration, it is because it\nactually has a duration. This argument rests on three\nassumptions: \n\n our experience of sounds can last a certain amount of time; \n we usually say we hear happenings, such as the slamming of a door\nor the falling of a tree, which we commonly refer to as\n\u201cevents\u201d; \n the events we hear have a duration that seems to coincide with\nthe duration of our experience of them. \n\n\nFor Kulvicki, even though the concurrence of these three assumptions\ndoes not imply that sounds have durations, the claim that sounds have\na duration is still the best explanation of the three\nuncontroversial claims. Therefore, even though, he does not propose a\nway to completely undermine this argument, he suggests a way to weaken\nit at least. The dispositional view can account for the third auditory\nintuition\u2014for which the time the events we hear take to occur is\noften coincident with the duration of the related auditory\nexperience\u2014emphasizing the role of mechanical stimulants. If we\nimagine the circumstance of a \u201clong-lasting, broad-spectrum\nmechanical stimulant\u201d (2014: 214) which thwacks the sounding\nobject in a stable vibratory disposition, it is not surprising that we\nhear events for about as long as we hear sounds. Kulvicki himself\nrecognizes that this is not a conclusive way of excluding that sounds\nhave durations, but yet it is a way of weakening this claim.\n\nRecently Kulvicki (2017: 91) has proposed a more inclusive view of\nwhat sounds are. He admits that identifying sounds with the mere\nvibratory dispositions of objects does not seem to capture the full\nrange of the auditory experience. Therefore, among sounds he includes\nalso aspects of events and the contexts in which those aspects are\nheard, and distinguishes between non-perspectival and perspectival\nqualities. The former are the dispositions of objects to vibrate in\nresponse to being mechanically stimulated but also happenings, and the\nsecond are \u201cabstractions over features of objects, events, and\nenvirons\u201d (2017: 87). Both qualities are taken to be sounds,\nwhich are a \u201cmongrel\u201d category. Kulvicki explains that the\nperspectival qualities are \u201cabstraction over intrinsic and\nrelational features of ordinary objects, environments, and range\nevents in which they participate\u201d (2017: 90). That is,\nconcerning some aspects things sound in a way and, concerning other\naspects, they sound differently, depending on the perspective. When we\nimitate the voice of someone, the reproduction of her voice is similar\nto the original in some respects but is different in others. Within\nKulvicki\u2019s view, the worry is that sounds seem to be different\nkinds of things, very distant and often in opposition with each other\n(features of objects but also happenings, perspectival properties but\nalso non-perspectival qualities). Rather than claiming that these are\ndifferent ways of characterizing sounds, Kulvicki is exhaustively\ntelling us the different things we can hear, without explaining in\nfull what sounds are.\n4. Aspatial Theories\n\nWe divided up existing accounts of sounds according to the spatial\nlocation they assign to sounds. However, there are aspatial theories\nof sounds as well. Aspatial theories deny either (i) that sounds are\nintrinsically spatial, or (ii) that auditory perception is\nintrinsically spatial. Arguably, claim (i) implies claim (ii), but the\nconverse is not true, which leaves room for an interesting aspatial\ntheory of auditory perception which nevertheless acknowledges that\nsounds have some spatial locations.\n4.1 Aspatial Sounds\n\nWe have seen the use of phenomenological arguments against both medial\nand proximal theories of sound. To sum them up, one may claim that,\nfirst, auditory experience has a spatial content whereby sounds seem\nto be located in egocentric space (to the left, above, in front of us,\netc.). Second, unless one subscribes to an error theory of auditory\nexperience, sounds are where they are (normally) heard to be, namely\nat their sources.\n\nBefore presenting a-spatial theories, let us conclude the discussion\non the spatial theories of sound by adding that they all share the\nassumptions that reflections on the spatiality of audition are crucial\nin order to tackle issues on the metaphysics of sound\u2014that is,\nwe can say what sounds are when we know where they\nare located (Di Bona 2019). Moreover, considerations on the spatiality\nof audition and sounds are also important to understand the\nsegregation of auditory streams\u2014which constitute the auditory\nlandscape\u2014and the experience of some musical compositions\n(2019). Finally\u2014despite the remarkable difference between the\nspatiality of vision and the spatiality of audition due to the fact\nthat, in audition, we perceive where sources are, the space between us\nand the sources (O\u2019Callaghan 2010b) and the space between the\nsources, whereas, in vision, we perceive also where objects are\npotentially to be seen (Nudds 2009)\u2014spatial cues can also enter\nthe auditory content and provide info on the volume of empty space,\nespecially when derived from reverberations produced in a specific\nclosed space (Young 2017).\n But are sounds really located in space? There is in the literature\na strong non-locational view of sounds. Strawson has made the\nplausibility of a thought-experiment of a purely auditory world rest\nupon the tenet of an intrinsic non-spatiality of sounds. (Philosophers\nand psychologists such as Lotze (1841 [1884: Ch. 6, 123\u20136]),\nBinet (1905: Ch. 3), Heymans (1911 [1905]: Ch. 1), Stumpf (1883\u20131890: Vol. 1,\n29), Wellek (1934), R\u00e9v\u00e9sz (1946), Ihde (1976: Ch. 6),\nEvans (1980 [1986: 248 ff.]), have investigated the phenomenology of\nauditory space and suggested the possibility of a purely auditory\nworld.) Strawson (1959: 65\u201366) thus wrote: \n\n\nSounds\u2026have no intrinsic spatial characteristics: such\nexpressions as \u201cto the left of\u201d, \u201cspatially\nabove\u201d, \u201cnearer\u201d, \u201cfarther\u201d have no\nintrinsically auditory significance (\u2026). A purely auditory\nconcept of space\u2026is an impossibility. The fact that, with the\nvariegated types of sense-experience which we in fact have, we can, as\nwe say, \u201con the strength of hearing alone\u201d assign\ndirections and distances to sounds, and things that emit or cause\nthem, counts against this not at all. For this fact is sufficiently\nexplained by the existence of correlations between the variations of\nwhich sound is intrinsically capable and other non-auditory features\nof sense-experience.\n\n\nStrawson designed his thought-experiment in the context of an analysis\nof the Kantian claim that the notion of there being objective entities\n(entities which do not depend on our perception of them) involves the\nnotion of space: \n\n\n[t]he question we are to consider, then, is this: Could a being whose\nexperience was purely auditory have a conceptual scheme which provided\nfor objective particulars? (Strawson 1959: 66) \n\n\nThus, he imagined a character (later on called \u201cHero\u201d by\nEvans 1980) who has only non-spatial auditory experiences. Hero\nperceives sounds, but he does not perceive them to be located in\nphysical space. What Strawson tried to show is that Hero needs an\n\u201canalogue\u201d to the notion of space in order to\n\u201clocate\u201d sounds when they are not actually heard. This\nanalogue is provided by what Strawson calls a\n\u201cmaster-sound\u201d, namely a constant sound varying in pitch.\nAny particular sound is heard against the background of the\nmaster-sound. Thanks to the master-sound, Hero can distinguish between\nexperiencing the same particular sound again (when its\n\u201clocation\u201d as provided by the master-sound is the same),\nand experiencing successively two particular sounds of the same type\n(when they have different \u201clocations\u201d on the master-sound\nmap). Evans (1980) questioned the claim that the master-sound could\nplay the role of physical space in grounding the notion of objective\nparticulars; see also Strawson\u2019s (1980) reply to Evans.\n\nIn evaluating Strawson\u2019s thought-experiment, we should\ndistinguish the claim that there can be non-spatial auditory\nexperiences from the claim that there can be a world populated only\nwith sounds. Strawson\u2019s thought-experiment justifies the former\nclaim, but it does not obviously lead to the latter. One cannot infer\nfrom the fact that we can perceptually represent a sound without\nrepresenting its location, that we can perceptually represent a\nnon-located sound.\n4.2 Aspatial Auditory Perception\n\nIt is possible to argue that auditory perception is not intrinsically\nspatial independently of a commitment to the claim that sounds do not\nhave spatial locations. This is O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s view, who\nwrites that \n\n\nwhile we have the auditory experience of hearing that a sound comes\nfrom p, we do not have any experience that it is here where it now\nsounds\u2026And this is so for a very interesting reason: namely,\nthat we absolutely never immediately perceive sounds to be at any\nplace. (2000: 446) \n\n\nHowever, O\u2019Shaughnessy does not draw the conclusion that sounds\nhave no spatial locations. On the contrary, as we have seen, he\ndefends a proximal account of the location of sounds, according to\nwhich sounds are where hearers, rather than sources, are (2009).\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy would not be impressed by allegedly\nphenomenological arguments according to which one normally hears\nsounds as located at their sources. One may still have the feeling\nthat his sophisticated version of proximal theories does not locate\nsounds where an untutored description of what is perceived suggests\nthey are. As a consequence, it appears to be another massive error\ntheory of auditory perception.\n4.3 Sounds as Pure Events\n\nScruton (2009a, 2009b; see also his 1997) proposes a non-physicalist\naccount of sounds. He is impressed by the fact that when we hear\nsounds as music we (can) hear them as events detached from their\nphysical causes. He then suggests that sounds are \u201cpure\nevents\u201d, things that happen but which don\u2019t happen to\nanything, and that they are \u201csecondary objects\u201d, entities\nwhose nature is bound up with the way we perceive them.\n\nOne way of reconciling Scruton\u2019s interesting suggestions with a\nphysicalist account of sounds is to draw a distinction (which of\ncourse should be properly developed) between the ontology we need to\naccount for our ecological ability to hear sounds in our natural\nenvironment and the ontology we need to account for our (at least\npartly acquired) ability to hear sounds as music. Eventually, the\nontology of sounds as music, which Scruton wants to focus on, might be\nquite different from the ontology of natural sounds, which can still\nbe of the physicalist kind.\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe have suggested that a fruitful way to classify the various accounts\nof sounds that have been given in the literature is in terms of their\nspatial locations. If the sounds we hear have spatial locations, they\ncan be thought to be located either where the material sources are\n(distal theories), or where the hearers are (proximal theories), or\nsomewhere in between (medial theories). It has also been denied that\nsounds have any spatial locations, which gives rise to a fourth class\nof theories, aspatial theories. All these theories have interestingly\ndifferent phenomenological, epistemological and metaphysical\nimplications.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aristotle, <em>De Anima</em> (<em>On the Soul</em>), in <em>The\nComplete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation</em>,\nJames Barnes (trans.), Oxford: Princeton University Press, 1991.", "Bennett, Jonathan, 1996, \u201cWhat Events Are\u201d, in Casati\nand Varzi 1996: 137\u2013151.", "Berkeley, George, 1713 [1975], <em>Three Dialogues Between Hylas\nand Philonous</em>, reprinted in M.R.
