    "main_text": "Objections to Disjunctivism || The Explanatory Power of the Common Kind Claim\n4.1 The Explanatory Power of the Common Kind Claim\n\n\nSturgeon (1998) offers a number of reasons for thinking that our\ndefault view should be the thesis that there is a common factor to\nveridical perceptions, illusions and hallucinations\u2014i.e., the\nthesis that they all involve perceptual states of the same basic\nkind\u2014rather than the disjunctivist view.\n\n\nSturgeon points to a number of features that can be common to\nveridical perceptions, illusions, and hallucinations. Among the\nfeatures he points to are the following: (i) veridical perceptions,\nillusions and hallucinations can produce similar behavioural effects.\nFor example, in general, if it sensibly appears to you as though a\nrock is flying towards you, you will duck, irrespective of whether the\nexperience you are having is a veridical perception, an illusion, or a\nhallucination. (ii) If, on the basis of that experience, you believe\nthat a rock is flying towards you, and you act on that belief and\nduck, there is a sense in which your belief and action are rational,\nirrespective of whether that experience is a veridical perception, an\nillusion, or a hallucination. (iii) If you have an experience as of a\nrock flying towards you, you can know what it\u2019s like to see a rock\nflying towards you, irrespective of whether that experience is a\nveridical perception, an illusion, or a hallucination. (iv) Veridical\nperceptions, illusions and hallucinations can be introspectively\nindistinguishible.\n\n\nSturgeon suggests that the most obvious explanation of the fact that\nthese experiences share these features is the proposal they all involve\nmental states of the same kind. So this should be our default view\nuntil we are given reason to be persuaded otherwise.\n\n\nThe disjunctivist may try to explain the fact that illusions and\nhallucinations can have the same kinds of behavioural effects as\nveridical perceptions by simply appealing to the fact that such\nexperiences can be subjectively indistinguishible from veridical\nperceptions. Since the difference between a hallucination and a\nveridical perception may be something that a subject is unable to\ndetect through introspection, the hallucination will naturally give\nrise to effects that are similar to those of the veridical perception.\nThe subject will respond to such a hallucination in the same kind of\nway in which she would respond to a veridical perception. And there is a\nsense in which this response can be regarded as rational.\n\n\nHowever, the disjunctivist who denies that a hallucination can have\nthe same phenomenal character as a veridical perception will be put\nunder pressure to offer some positive explanation of the fact that a\nhallucination can seem to have the same phenomenal character as a\nveridical perception, and in particular, to offer some explanation of\nhow it is that a subject can come to know what it is like to have a\nveridical perception of an F through simply having a\nhallucination of an F, given that the hallucination does not\nactually possess the what-it-is-like properties of the veridical\nperception. As Hellie (2007) notes, while not everything is\nthe way it appears, there is a strong intuition that the phenomenal\ndomain is distinctive\u2014if an experience appears to have a certain\nphenomenal property, then it has that property as phenomenal\ncharacter. The tenability of the form of disjunctivism that denies\nthat veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have the same\nphenomenal character will depend on whether this epistemic assumption\ncan plausibly be denied (see the discussion of this point in section\n3.4), and whether the disjunctivist can make a satisfactory case for\nthinking that veridical perceptions appear to have a phenomenal\ncharacter that hallucinations could not possess (see section 3.3).\n",
