Accommodating the Import of Higher-Order Evidence\n\nIn this section we will look more closely at the possibilities for\naccommodating higher-order defeat. Even setting aside questions about\nhow such defeat fits into the rest of our epistemological theory,\nthere are several more local questions about how higher-order defeat\nworks. What sort of principle could explain the intuitive verdicts in\ncases like Hypoxia? Which evidence and reasoning can agents like Aisha\nrely on in forming their beliefs, and under what circumstances? What\ndetermines which attitude, exactly, Aisha should have towards\nG after taking both her first-order and her higher-order\nevidence into account?\n\nThere are a couple of different ideas that epistemologists sympathetic\nto higher-order evidence typically aim to capture. One is the thought\nthat higher-order evidence requires us to \u201cbracket\u201d or set\naside some of our first-order evidence and reasoning. This is often\ncalled \u201cIndependence\u201d. The second is the thought that, in\naccommodating one\u2019s higher-order evidence, one should somehow\nadjust one\u2019s first-order belief to match what one has\nlearned from the higher-order evidence: either to match what one\nbelieves or has reason to believe would be rational, to match\none\u2019s expected level of reliability, or some variation\non one of these. Principles dictating how one should calibrate\none\u2019s first-order beliefs in light of higher-order evidence are\noften called \u201clevel-bridging principles\u201d or\n\u201ccalibration principles\u201d.\n\nMany specific proposals for how to accommodate higher-order evidence\n(often focusing on the case of disagreement, which we can think of as\na variety of higher-order defeat) combine both of these ideas. For\nexample, here is Elga\u2019s (2007: 490) formulation of the\n\u201cEqual Weight View\u201d of disagreement:\n\n\nEqual weight view Upon finding out that an advisor\ndisagrees, your probability that you are right should equal your prior\nconditional probability that you would be right. Prior to what? Prior\nto your thinking through the disputed issue, and finding out what the\nadvisor thinks of it. Conditional on what? On whatever you have\nlearned about the circumstances of the disagreement.\n\n\nCalibrating your confidence to the probability that \u201cyou would\nbe right\u201d is a way of matching your confidence in P to your\nexpected reliability about P, so the Equal Weight View is in part a\nlevel-bridging principle. And the \u201cprior\u201d and\n\u201cconditional\u201d clauses commit Elga to an Independence\nprinciple as well: he is saying that we must set aside the\nspecific first-order evidence and reasoning about the relevant matter,\nand consider only the surrounding \u201ccircumstances\u201d. In the\nvery next paragraph Elga clarifies that \u201cwhatever you have\nlearned about the circumstances of the disagreement\u201d must be\nindependent from the reasoning leading to the disagreement itself.\nInstead, it should include facts about the situation that would affect\nyour or your peer\u2019s reliability, such as how much coffee you\nhave each had, how absurd you find the other person\u2019s answer,\nand whether the reasoning invites a type of mistake that you or your\nfriend is especially likely to make.\n\nThe next two subsections discuss Independence and level-bridging\nseparately. But many authors who endorse one of these (in one form or\nanother) also endorse the other.\n",
