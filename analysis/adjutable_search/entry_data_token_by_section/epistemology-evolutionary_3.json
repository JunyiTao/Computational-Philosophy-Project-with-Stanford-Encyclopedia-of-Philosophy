    "main_text": "History, Problems, and Issues || Descriptive versus Prescriptive Approaches\n1.3 Descriptive versus Prescriptive Approaches\n\nA third distinction concerns descriptive versus prescriptive\napproaches to epistemology and the growth of human knowledge.\nTraditionally, epistemology has been construed as a normative project\nwhose aim is to clarify and defend conceptions of knowledge,\nfoundations, evidential warrant and justification. Many have argued\nthat neither the EEM programs nor the EET programs have anything at\nall to do with epistemology properly (i.e., traditionally) understood.\nThe basis for this contention is that epistemology, properly\nunderstood, is a normative discipline, whereas the EEM and EET\nprograms are concerned with the construction of causal and genetic\n(i.e., descriptive) models of the evolution of cognitive capacities or\nknowledge systems. No such models, it is alleged, can have anything\nimportant to contribute to normative epistemology (e.g., Kim 1988).\nThe force of this complaint depends upon how one construes the\nrelationship between evolutionary epistemology and the tradition. \n\nThere are three possible configurations of the relationship between\ndescriptive and traditional epistemologies. (1) Descriptive\nepistemologies can be construed as competitors to traditional\nnormative epistemologies. On this view, both are trying to address the\nsame concerns and offering competing solutions. Riedl (1984) defends\nthis position. A standard objection to such approaches is that\ndescriptive accounts are not adequate to do justice to the\nprescriptive elements of normative methodologies. The extent to which\nan evolutionary approach contributes to the resolution of traditional\nepistemological and philosophical problems is a function of which\napproach one adopts (cf. Dretske 1971, Bradie 1986, Ruse 1986,\nRadnitsky and Bartley 1987, Kim 1988). (2) Descriptive epistemology\nmight be seen as a successor discipline to traditional epistemology.\nOn this reading, descriptive epistemology does not address the\nquestions of traditional epistemology because it deems them irrelevant\nor unanswerable or uninteresting. Many defenders of naturalized\nepistemologies fall into this camp (e.g., Munz 1993). (3) Descriptive\nepistemology might be seen as complementary to traditional\nepistemology. This appears to be Campbell\u2019s view. On this\nanalysis, the function of the evolutionary approach is to provide a\ndescriptive account of knowing mechanisms while leaving the\nprescriptive aspects of epistemology to more traditional approaches.\nAt best, the evolutionary analyses serve to rule out normative\napproaches which are either implausible or inconsistent with an\nevolutionary origin of human understanding.\n",
