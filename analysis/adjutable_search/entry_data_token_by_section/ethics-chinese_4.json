They responded on two subjects: first, they had to address\nwhat is required by way of concern for all people and how to reconcile\nsuch concern with the greater concern for some that the Confucian\ndoctrine of care with distinctions requires; second, they had to\naddress the question of what kinds of concern are motivationally\npossible for human beings, partly in response to the Mohist argument\nthat it is not difficult to act on jian ai (which they came\nto interpret as being contrary to care with distinctions), and partly\nin response to others who were skeptical about the possibility of\nacting on any kind of genuinely other-regarding concern. Mencius, in\nthe text purporting to be a record of his teachings, explicitly sets\nhimself to the task of defending Confucianism not only against Mohism\nbut the teachings of Yang Zhu. Yang\u2019s teachings seemed to\nMencius to sit on the opposite end of the spectrum from Mohism (there\nis no surviving text purporting to articulate and defend Yangism).\nAccording to Mencius\u2019s characterization, Yang Zhu criticized\nboth Mohism and Confucianism for asking people to sacrifice themselves\nfor others. Yang Zhu on this view was an ethical egoist: i.e., one who\nholds that it is always right to promote one\u2019s own welfare.\nMencius positioned Confucianism as the occupying the correct mean\nbetween the extremes of having concern only for oneself on the one\nhand and having an equal degree of concern for everyone.\n\nMencius 1A7 purports to be an account of a conversation\nbetween Mencius and King Xuan, the ruler of a Chinese state. Mencius\nis attempting to persuade the king to adopt the Confucian dao\nor way of ruling. The king wonders whether he really can be the kind\nof king Mencius is advocating, and Mencius replies by asking whether\nthe following story he has heard about the king is true. The story is\nthat the king saw an ox being led to slaughter for a ritual sacrifice.\nThe king decided to spare the ox and substituted a lamb for the ritual\nsacrifice. Thinking back on that occasion, the king recalls that it\nwas the look in the ox\u2019s eyes, like that of an innocent man\nbeing led to execution, that led him to substitute the lamb. Mencius\nthen comments that this story demonstrates the king\u2019s capability\nto become a true king, and that all he has to do is to extend the sort\nof compassion he showed the ox to his own people. To say that he can\ncare for an ox but not for his people is like saying \u201cmy\nstrength is sufficient to lift heavy weight, but not enough to lift a\nfeather\u201d (translation adapted from Lau, 1970a) His failure to\nact on behalf of his people is due simply to his not acting, not to an\ninability to act. What the king has to do, suggests Mencius, is to\ntreat the aged in his family as aged, and then extend it to the aged\nin other families; treat his young ones as young ones, and extend it\nto the young ones of others; then he can turn the whole world in the\npalm of his hand.\n\nThe passage demonstrates one characteristic of the text that is\npertinent to Mencius\u2019s response to Mohism and quite possibly its\ninfluence on him. In contrast to the Analects, the\nruler\u2019s duties to care for his people are more frequently\ndiscussed and play a more prominent role in the conception of a\nruler\u2019s moral excellence. Mencius is portrayed in this text as\nvery much engaged in getting the kings of Chinese states to stop\nmistreating their subjects, to stop drafting their subjects into their\nwars of territorial expansion, and to avoid overtaxing them to finance\ntheir wars and lavish projects. At the same time, Mencius\u2019s\nassertion that the king is able to extend the kind of concern he\nshowed the ox toward his own people is a reply to those who advocate\nYangism on the grounds that acting for one\u2019s own sake is\nnatural. Mencius holds that natural compassion is a part of human\nnature. The task of moral self-cultivation is the task of\n\u201cextending\u201d what is natural. What is natural, or at least\nmore so, is properly acting toward the aged and the young in\none\u2019s family and then extending that to the aged and the young\nin other families.\n\nExtension is necessary because natural compassion is uneven compared\nto where it ought to extend. King Xuan may find it natural to have\ncompassion for an innocent man about to be executed or a terrified ox\nabout to be slaughtered, but not toward all his subjects when he is\nfocusing on the benefits that a war of territorial expansion might\nbring him. This story of Mencius, the King, and the ox is rich\nmaterial for reflection on the nature of moral development. It seems\nplausible that development must begin with something that is of the\nright nature to be shaped into the moral virtues, and also plausible\nthat what we begin with is not as it fully should be. The questions\nposed by the story is what the natural basis of morality is and how\nfurther development occurs. Mencius\u2019s theory of the \u201cfour\nduan\u201d addresses these questions.\n\u201cDuan\u201d literally means \u201ctip of\nsomething\u201d and is often translated as \u201cbeginnings\u201d\nin this context.\n\nWhat are the four beginnings of morality? In 2A6 human nature (ren\nxing) it is said that no person is devoid of a heart (the word\nfor heart in Chinese stands for the seat of thinking and feeling,\nhence often translated as \u201cthe mind\u201d) sensitive to the\nsuffering of others, and to illustrate this beginning, Mencius asks us\nto suppose that a man were suddenly to see a young child about to fall\ninto a well. Such a man would certainly be moved to compassion, not\nbecause he wanted to get in the good graces of the parents, nor\nbecause he wished to win the praise of his fellow villagers or\nfriends, nor yet because he disliked the cry of the child. This\nnatural compassion can develop into the virtue of ren (in\nMencius, ren is more often a particular virtue that concerns\ncaring and hence is often translated as \u201cbenevolence\u201d or\n\u201chumaneness\u201d). A second beginning is the heart that feels shame in\ncertain situations, e.g., in 6A10, Mencius says that if rice and soup\nare offered after being trampled upon, even a beggar would disdain\nthem. Under the right conditions, innate shame develops into the\nvirtue of yi or righteousness\u2014being able to do the\nright thing and dedication to doing it. The third beginning is the\nheart that feels courtesy,e.g., the younger sometimes instinctively\nknows to respect and be courteous to the older. Under the right\nconditions, courtesy develops into li, which as a virtue\nconsists in the observance of the rites or the virtue of ritual\npropriety. And finally, there is the heart that can make morally\nrelevant distinctions (shi/fei, the thing to do or not\nto do). Under the right conditions, this sense of approval and\ndisapproval develops into wisdom, which includes having a grasp of the\nspirit behind moral rules so that one knows how to be flexible in\napplying them.\n\nIt is important to note that Mencian beginnings of morality are not\njust blind feelings or primitive urges to act in certain ways, but\ncontain within them certain intuitive judgments about what is right\nand wrong, what is to be disdained and what is deferential, respectful\nbehavior. In the example of the beggar who does not accept food that\nhas been trampled upon, it seems that Mencius is suggesting we have an\noriginal, unlearned sense that allows us to judge the sort of respect\nthat is due to ourselves as human beings. Similarly, in suggesting\nthat we have an unlearned sense of deference, Mencius is suggesting\nthat we have an unlearned sense of what is due to others such as\nelders and our parents. Mencius\u2019s theory tallies with some of\nthe more recent theories of emotion that point toward the intertwining\nof cognitive and affective dimensions (the theory does not necessarily\nimply, however, that the affective amounts to nothing more than the\ncognitive, as shall be discussed later).\n\nThe Mencius contains different metaphors that convey a view\nof human nature as the basis for moral development. On one metaphor,\nused in a debate with rival philosopher Gaozi in 6A2, the inborn\ngoodness of human nature is like the tendency of water to flow\ndownward. The metaphor implies that human beings develop virtues in\nthe absence of abnormal interference such as water being damned up or\nstruck so that it splashes upward. On the other way of conceiving\nethical development, the four beginnings are more like barley sprouts\nthat need nurture analogous to sun, water, and fertile soil (6A7).\nMencius seems to treat the the two conceptions as equivalent, but\narguably they are are significantly different since\nthe \u201cgrowing\u201d conditions for the sprouts are not\nnecessarily provided in the normal course of affairs (see Wong,\n2015b).\n\nIn some passages, extension is characterized as a matter of simply\npreserving or not losing what is given to one at birth (4B12, 4B19,\n4B28, 6A10, 6A11), and such passages accord with the water metaphor in\nsuggesting that moral development happens in the absence of abnormal\ninterference. In other places, the thinking seems to be more in accord\nwith the sprout metaphor and identifies conditions for moral\ndevelopment that go well beyond noninterference: kings are held\nresponsible for providing for their subjects a constant means of\nlivelihood (1A7) that enables them to support parents and nurture wife\nand children; kings must also ensure the appropriate moral education\nabout filiality, about the duties that rulers and subjects owe to each\nother and about respect for the elder. Mencius furthermore recognized\nnatural predispositions other than the four beginnings that could\npotentially lead human beings astray. He mentions the desires of the\nsenses in this regard (6A15). This is why Mencius places\nresponsibility on everyone to si (reflect on, turn over in\none\u2019s mind) (6A14, 6A15) the manifestations of the four\nbeginnings. With such reflection, human beings can recognize that\nvirtue takes precedence over satisfaction of potentially conflicting\ndesires and feelings (e.g., the priority of righteousness over the\ndesire for life if one cannot have both), but lack of reflection will\nstunt moral development (6A9). If the deprivation of nourishing\nconditions is severe enough, the sprouts can be killed off (6A8).\nThus, while Mencius is often characterized superficially by his saying\nthat human nature is good (6A6), he means (at least when his thinking\nis guided by the sprout metaphor) that it contains predispositions to\nfeel and act in morally appropriate ways and to make intuitive\nnormative judgments that can with the right nurturing conditions give\nhuman beings guidance as to the proper emphasis to be given to the\ndesires of the senses (see Shun, 1997; Van Norden, 2004, 2007).\n\nIt is not surprising that there should be the kind of ambiguity\nexpressed by the juxtaposition of the water and sprout metaphors in\nMencius. A very common contemporary conception of the innate comes\nvery close to the implications of the water metaphor, i.e., that which\ndevelops under normal conditions. On the other hand, we are also\ncapable of recognizing that other things develop under a narrower or\nmuch more contingent (not necessarily realized in the normal course of\naffairs) set of conditions. A barley sprout develops only if human\nbeings plant it in the right kind of soil and put effort into\ncultivating it. Yet it seems intuitively correct to say that its\ndirection of growth is innate. If the conditions for growth are\nrealized, it will become a barley plant, not a corn plant.\nContemporary thinking about the innate bases of morality also shows\nthis range of thinking. Claims that morality is constrained by an\ninnate universal grammar (e.g., Hauser, 2008; Mikhail, 2011) seem\ncloser to the idea that the moral (or its underlying universal\nstructure) develops under normal conditions; other conceptions\nacknowledge more of a role for contingent factors (Nichols, 2004;\nHaidt and Bjorklund 2008). The ambiguity in Mencius\u2019 thought,\nthen, anticipates contemporary swings in thinking about the relative\nroles of what human beings are born with and what they acquire through\nlearning, experience and culture.\n\nMuch of what is fascinating in Mencius lies in his explorations of how\nmoral learning takes place and how this learning might also interact\nwith emotion. Consider now in combination the theme that the cognitive\nand affective go into the constitution of emotion and the theme that\nthe emotional beginnings of morality can be extended through provision\nof the right kind of nurture. What is necessary for extension? Is\ncognitive extension, i.e., more moral knowledge, sufficient? The\nanswer to this question depends on the nature of the intertwining\nbetween the cognitive and affective in emotions. Consider again the\nstory of King Xuan and the ox. Mencius expresses confidence in King\nXuan\u2019s ability to have compassion for his people, based on his\nact of compassion for the ox. Here the question of whether cognitive\nextension is sufficient emerges in the concrete. Was it sufficient for\nMencius to have reminded the king that he has even more of a reason to\nspare his people from suffering than he had to spare the ox from\nsuffering (more reason because Mencius clearly ranks the interests of\nanimals below those of human beings, and because for him there is a\ngood moral reason for the performance of ritual sacrifices)? Logical\nconsistency alone cannot be expected to provide motivation, as David\nNivison has pointed out (1996), but then what is Mencius trying to do\nwith the King if not move him through logic?\n\nNowhere in the Mencius is there enough said to point to a\ndefinitive interpretation on this matter, but various reconstructions\nof possible positions can be given. Perhaps the King\u2019s innate\nnature contains all the motivation he needs, and all that Mencius is\ndoing is reminding him that he has the motivation to spare his people.\nThis interpretation seems roughly in accord with Mencius\u2019\nlikening moral development to water flowing downward: it will proceed\nunless interfered with. Perhaps the King\u2019s nature needs some\ndegree of transformation that starts with the sort of compassion he\ncan feel for a terrified ox or an innocent man about to be executed\nand then expands the scope of that compassion to more of its\nappropriate objects. This interpretation seems roughly in accord with\nMencius\u2019 likening moral development to the growth of sprouts\nthat need the appropriate water, soil and cultivation efforts. (See\nIm, 1999, Ivanhoe, 2002, Shun, 1997, Wong, 2002, Van Norden, 2007, and\nMcRae 2011 for a range of different possible positions that could be\nattributed to Mencius).\n\nWhat seems philosophically fruitful about the Xuan and ox story is\nthat it portrays an attempt at moral teaching of the kind that\nactually occurs in the moral life, and the ambiguity that it presents\nto the reader is fruitful precisely because it is not a completely\ntheorized story. We are not told exactly what Mencius is trying to do\nwith the King in terms of a theory of the nature of emotions and the\nrelation between the cognitive and affective. Rather, we are led to\nreflect on the most plausible possibilities in trying to arrive at a\nreconstruction of what might have been meant by the text, as well as\nwhat might be the most illuminating position on its own merits. The\nstory is particularly intriguing for those philosophers who believe in\nthe possibility that learning can influence emotion at the same time\nthat emotion can help learning become motivationally efficacious. At\none moment in the conversation between King Xuan and Mencius, the King\nremarks that Mencius has helped him to understand that he was truly\nmotivated by compassion to spare the ox. As Mencius was talking, he\nsays, he felt the stirrings of compassion again. It is at this point\nthat Mencius reminds the King of the suffering of his people. Perhaps\nwhat Mencius was trying to do was to expand the scope of the\nKing\u2019s feeling for those who suffer. He may know in the abstract\nthat he has a duty to advance the welfare of his people, but he may\nnot feel it very much, and by stimulating the King to re-experience\nthe feeling of compassion he had for the ox, Mencius is perhaps trying\nto get that feeling to expand to include his subjects. Mencius is\nreminding the King of his duty precisely when he has primed the King\nto assimilate it emotionally. In any case, this is a plausible picture\nof how the cognitive and affective can interact in emotionally\ndevelopment and both be necessary for effective moral motivation (see\nWong, 2015a).\n\nIf we recall Mencius\u2019s saying in 6A10 that even a beggar would\nrefuse food that has been trampled upon, we may infer that something\nlike a concept of human dignity is implied. In virtue of the four\nduan, we are entitled to respect. What is of further\ninterest, however, is the idea that the source of our dignity is also\nthe source of our responsibilities to each other and to ourselves. We\nhave the responsibility of reflecting on the duan, and if we\nabuse them and kill them off, we have made ourselves unworthy of the\nrespect to which we were originally entitled. These implications of\nthe Mencian idea about the source of human dignity are not so much\nhighlighted in the Western tradition. The idea that we might render\nourselves unworthy of the basic respect to which we are originally\nentitled might appear harsh, but what should be kept in mind is that\nothers share in the responsibility to develop our duan (see\nsection 2.8 below). Most importantly our family shares in that\nresponsibility, but as Mencius also emphasizes, the king has\nresponsibility for putting in the conditions for material security\nthat enable most people to reflect on and develop their duan.\nIn fact Mencius holds responsible the king who does not provide a\nconstant means of livelihood for the crimes his people commit in order\nto survive and feed their families. It is those who have adequate\nmaterial security and moral education and yet who still fail to\nreflect who must bear the fuller share of responsibility for their\nwrongdoing.\n\nWhat about the priority of filial loyalty over loyalty to the larger\ncommunity? Mencius\u2019 defense of this priority draws from his\ntheory of human nature as containing not only the beginnings of\naffective motivations for being moral but also intuitive judgments\nabout what is right and about what deserves the feeling of shame. His\nquestion to a Mohist, Yizi, is how Yizi can justify providing his\ndeceased parents a special burial when the Mohist prescriptions are\nfor a plain burial for anyone. Yizi\u2019s reply is to quote from the\nBook of History: the sage-kings treated all their subjects as\nif they were their new-born children. Yizi\u2019s interpretation of\nthis saying is that there should be no distinctions in one\u2019s\nconcern for people, though the practice of it may begin with\none\u2019s parents (how concern without distinctions is compatible\nwith special burial for one\u2019s parents is unclear, and there is\nno further clarification in 3A5, but the issue involves the question\nof what Mohists meant by jian ai, which is addressed in\nsection 3 below). Mencius\u2019s counter-reply is to ask whether Yizi\nreally holds that a person loves his elder brother\u2019s son no more\nthan his neighbor\u2019s baby. This is not just an assertion about\nwhat people tend to feel but also an assertion about what people\nintuitively hold to be right to feel and to do. Then Mencius makes a\npuzzling remark to the effect that Yizi is singling out a special\nfeature in a certain case: \u201cwhen a new-born babe creeps toward a\nwell, it is not its fault.\u201d This last part of Mencius\u2019s\nresponse is puzzling because Yizi did not say anything about a baby\nand a well. One possibility is that Yizi may have obliquely referred\nto Mencius\u2019s claim that all have the original and unlearned\nfeeling of distress at seeing a child about to fall into a well. In\nother words, Yizi might have been challenging Mencius by asking,\n\u201cDoes not your own postulated unlearned compassion require us to\nregard that child the same way, regardless of whose child it\nis?\u201d This way of taking Yizi helps makes sense of\nMencius\u2019s reply. First, he points out what he takes to be the\nindisputably greater affection one feels for elder brother\u2019s son\nover one\u2019s neighbor\u2019s baby. Mencius grants that we all\nrespond to a child about to fall into the well with alarm and\ndistress, and it doesn\u2019t matter whose child it is. However, one\ncannot infer from this one particular situation that we ought to have\nequal concern for everyone in all situations. The case of the\nchild about to fall into the well has a particular feature that makes\nit relevant to treat it as one would any child. That feature seems to\nbe innocence.\n\nThe Mencian position is premised on the principle that it is right to\ntreat all people alike only when the ways they are alike are the most\nethically relevant features of the situation. We should do the same\nthing only when the similarities between two cases are the most\nethically relevant features of the situation. Mencius believes that in\nmany instances, the presence or absence of a family relationship to a\nperson is the most relevant feature (in deciding which children to\ngive gifts, the fact that one child is one\u2019s elder\nbrother\u2019s son and the other child is one\u2019s\nneighbor\u2019s child may be the most relevant feature). In other\ntypes of situations, such as a child about to fall into a well, it is\nthe innocence that children share that is the most relevant feature.\nThat is why it is proper to feel alarm or distress toward any child in\nthat situation. The implied application of this idea to the\nsage-kings\u2019 treatment of the people is that these kings treated\nall people alike insofar as they did not deserve the harm about to\nbefall them.\n\nTwo issues arise from this response to Mohism as he understood it\n(whether he understood it correctly will be addressed in section 3).\nOne issue is whether Mencius has sufficient warrant to trust the kinds\nof intuitive judgments he attributes to human nature. Mencius holds\nthat the beginnings of morality are sent by Heaven, but in the absence\nof such a metaphysical warrant, can these intuitive judgments be\naccepted, particularly the ones that underwrite care with\ndistinctions? Doubt about the metaphysical warrant may not doom\nMencius\u2019s response to Mohism, however, if one holds that all\nnormative theories ultimately depend on intuitive judgments and if one\nhas no good reason to be skeptical about these judgments. Thus one\nmight hold that whether or not there is a metaphysical warrant, there\nis a great deal of plausibility to the intuitive judgment about owing\nparents more concern because they are the source of one\u2019s life\nand nurturance. Of course one might also hold, as Mencius appears to\nhold, that people are owed concern in virtue of their being human, and\nthe possibility for conflict of duties arises from these different\nsources of concern. The second issue is how the Mencius text\ndeals with conflicts of the sort exemplified by the sheep-stealing\ncase in the Analects.\n\nThe text contains themes embodying the theme of filial loyalty, and as\nin the Analects, such loyalty takes precedence over public\njustice. 7A35 tells a story about the sage-emperor Shun that\nillustrates this theme. Because Shun was renowned for his filiality,\nMencius is asked what Shun would have done if his father killed a man.\nMencius replies that Shun could not stop the judge from apprehending\nhis father because the judge had the legal authority to act. But then,\nMencius says, Shun would have abdicated and fled with his father to\nthe edge of the sea. 5A2 and 5A3 describe the way that Shun dealt with\nhis half-brother Xiang\u2019s conspiring with his father and\nstepmother to kill him. He enfeoffed Xiang because all he could do as\na brother is to love him. At the same time, Shun appointed officials\nto administer the fief and to collect taxes and tributes, to protect\nthe people of Youbi from Xiang\u2019s potentially abusive ruling.\nThat is why some called Shun\u2019s act a banishment of Xiang.\nHowever, the Shun stories exhibit a complexity that differentiates\nthem from the story of the sheep-stealing coverup in the\nAnalects. Though filial loyalty is clearly given a priority\nin each story, there is in Shun\u2019s actions an acknowledgment of\nthe other value that comes into conflict with filial loyalty. Though\nShun ultimately gives priority to filial loyalty in the case of his\nfather, his first action acknowledges the value of public justice by\ndeclining to interfere with the judge while he is king. While Shun\ndeclines to punish his half-brother, he protects the people of\nXiang\u2019s new fiefdom.\n\nThese Shun stories illustrate that an agent\u2019s response to a\nsituation in which important values come into conflict need not be a\nstrict choice between honoring one value and wholly denying the other.\nWhile some sort of priority might have to be set in the end, there are\nalso ways to acknowledge the value that is subordinated, but how\nexactly that is to be done seems very much a matter of judgment in the\nparticular situation at hand. The Shun stories are an expression of\nthe Confucian theme that rightness cannot be judged on the basis of\nexceptionless general principles but a matter of judgment in the\nparticular situation. It is difficult to see how this theme can be\ntaught except by the way it is done in the Mencius: through\nexemplars of how it is done, and where the situation is presented\nthrough some kind of narrative.\n\nThe characteristic form of reasoning in Mencius is analogical\nreasoning (see Lau, 1970b; Wong, 2002). Starting from what seems true\nin one case and \u201cextending\u201d similar conclusions to another\ncase that has similar conclusions. The trick in doing analogical\nreasoning correctly, as suggested earlier, is to extend the similar\nconclusions only when the two cases share ethically relevant and\ndecisive features. The Mencius 4A17 shows a similar concern\nfor treating like cases alike. Mencius grants that to save the life of\none\u2019s drowning sister-in-law, one of course suspends the\ncustomary rule of propriety prohibiting the touching of man and woman\nwhen they are giving and receiving. Another philosopher proposes to\napply this idea of suspending the usual rules of propriety to save\nsomething else from drowning\u2014the entire Empire! Mencius replies\nthat one saves one\u2019s sister-in-law with one\u2019s hand but\ncannot save the Empire from drowning in chaos and corruption with\none\u2019s hand. The Empire can only be pulled out by the Way.\nMencius is rejecting the analogy between compromising on ritual\npropriety to save the country and compromising on propriety to save\none\u2019s sister-in-law. There is a relevant dissimilarity between\nthe case of the drowning sister-in-law and saving the country: one\ncannot save the Empire through compromises of ritual propriety, but\ninstead by following the Way, which itself involves following ritual\npropriety.\n\nSo what do we do when we confront a problematic case in the present\nand we do not automatically know what the right thing to do is?\nMencius believes we can rely on past cases in which we have made\nreliable judgments about, for example, what is right and shameful.\nThese reliable judgments made in past cases serve as paradigms or\nexemplars of correct ethical judgment. In encountering new\nproblem situations, we determine what sort of ethical reaction to the\nnew situation is correct by asking which of the cases in which\nwe\u2019ve had paradigm judgments are relevantly similar. We then\ndetermine what reactions to the new situations would be sufficiently\nsimilar to the relevant paradigm judgments. Analogical reasoning is\ncareful attention and comparing to a concrete paradigm. The\npool of paradigm ethical judgments we have not only includes cases\nfrom our own personal experience, but also include the experience of\nothers, especially those who serve as models of wise judgment. The\nstories of sage-king Shun in the Mencius text seem to give us\nsuch paradigms. Shun\u2019s judgments on what to do about conflicts\nbetween filial loyalty and public justice are perhaps meant to serve\nas paradigm judgments. The conception of moral reasoning found in the\nMencius offers important material for reflection on the\nprocess of moral judgment, especially for those who have come to\nreject the simple model of judgment as deduction from premises\nincluding a general moral principle and a description of the\nconditions that make the principle applicable to the situation at\nhand. The Mencian picture includes general moral considerations or\nvalues that bear on the situation at hand, such as the importance of\nfamily loyalty and public justice, but the picture also suggests that\njudgment in difficult situations includes finding a way to adequately\nrecognize and realize the values in play. \u201cFinding a way\u201d\nseems much more a matter of imagination and ingenuity rather than\ndeduction, but the Mencian picture also suggests that we can be guided\nby exemplars of wise judgment. Identifying the relevant similarities\nand dissimilarities between these exemplars and one\u2019s present\nsituation seems a matter of perception and close attention rather than\ndeduction from principle.\n",
