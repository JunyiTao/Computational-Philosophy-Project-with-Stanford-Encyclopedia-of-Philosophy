Rational Realism\n\nAfter intense study of Bardili\u2019s Grundri\u00df der Ersten\nLogik, gereinigt von den Irrth\u00fcmmern bisheriger Logiken\n\u00fcberhaupt, der Kantischen insbesondere; Keine Kritik sondern eine\nMedicina mentis, brauchbar haupts\u00e4chlich f\u00fcr Deutschlands\nKritische Philosophie [Outline of First Logic, Cleansed of\nthe Errors of Previous Logics in General and of the Kantian Logic in\nParticular. Not a Critique but a Medicine for the Mind, Especially\nUseful for Germany\u2019s Critical Philosophy],\nReinhold declared his allegiance to Bardili\u2019s system in December\n1799. Reinhold\u2019s explicit commitment to rational realism would\nlast until his \u201clinguistic turn.\u201d However, this final\nphase of Reinhold\u2019s philosophical development, focused on\nlanguage, was still strongly informed by rational realism.\n\nRational realism can be conceived of as a kind of ontological logic\ninsofar as the logical laws of thought are constitutive of nature. It\nforegrounds the concept of thinking qua thinking (Denken\nals Denken). Thinking qua thinking is not to be\nunderstood representationally as involving the relation between\nsubject and object, but as an original unity of thought and being. The\nprinciple of thinking qua thinking is expressed formally as\n\u201cA as A in A and through A.\u201d This principle indicates the\nessence, or \u201cinner character,\u201d of thinking qua\nthinking, namely \u201ceternally absolute identity\u201d\n(Bz\u00dc 1, p. 103). Absolute identity excludes all\ndistinguishability, distinction, and difference. For this reason, the\nessence of thinking qua thinking cannot consist in concepts,\njudgments, or inferences, and cannot admit of categorial\ndeterminations of quantity, quality, relation, or modality. These hold\nonly for the application of thinking qua thinking to\nsome matter. This matter is not derived directly from the principle of\nthinking qua thinking but is postulated (Bz\u00dc 1,\np. 111), since it is the condition of something being thought\n(Bz\u00dc 2, p. 182f; Bardili 1800: 67). Formally, matter is\nrepresented as C, which, in relation to reality (B) and\npossibility (\u2013B), yields a determinate object (b).\nThese terms are\u2014somewhat obscurely\u2014employed in various\nmathematical operations (addition, multiplication, division) to derive\nthe forms of intuition, the essence of a \u201cthing qua\nthing,\u201d the essence of judgment, organisms, life, and the\ncategories of substance, cause, and ground\n(Bz\u00dc 2, pp. 182\u2013199). For Reinhold, the\nmanifestation of pure thinking in nature is to be conceived of\ntheologically: at bottom, rational realism represents \u201cthe\nmanifestation of the original being in the essence of things,\nor the revelation of God in nature\u201d (Bz\u00dc 4, p.\n219; for discussion of rational realism\u2019s Neo-Platonist and\nreligious overtones, see Ahlers 2012).\n\nReinhold and Bardili\u2019s joint project faced significant\ncriticism. Fichte was quick to rebuke his former disciple in his\ntwo-part review of Bardili\u2019s Grundri\u00df, where he\nalso attacked Reinhold\u2019s earlier review of the same work.\nDespite his critical stance toward rational realism, lecture notes\nfrom 1804\u20131807 indicate that Fichte incorporated some of its\nelements into his own system (see Ferraguto 2020). Hegel, too, lost no\ntime in joining the fray, assailing Reinhold in his\nDifferenzschrift of 1801. Hegel would join forces with\nSchelling, co-editing the Kritisches Journal der Philosophie,\nwhich contained fierce criticisms of rational realism. Reinhold\nreplied to these onslaughts in subsequent issues of his\nBeytr\u00e4ge, taking aim especially at Schelling. The\nexchanges between these thinkers were bitter, leading Reinhold to call\nthe dispute a \u201cwar of annihilation\u201d (Bz\u00dc 5,\niii). This debate did not go unnoticed by the philosophical public,\nJoseph Kurz addressing the incendiary discourse in a short treatise in\n1803, Der philosophische Vertilgungskrieg [The\nPhilosophical War of Annihilation]. Marked by considerable mutual\nmisunderstanding, the controversy also highlights implicit lines of\ninfluence and important contrasts in the protagonists\u2019\nconceptions of the relationships between thought and being, form and\nmatter, and subjectivity and objectivity (for studies of this\nconstellation, see: Ahlers 2006; Ahlers 2012; Bondeli 1995a:\n314\u2013414; Bondeli 1995b; Bondeli 1997a; and Di Giovanni\n2006).\n",
