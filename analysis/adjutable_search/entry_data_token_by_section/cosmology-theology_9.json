    "main_text": "Other non-standard cosmologies || Cyclic cosmologies\n5.1 Cyclic cosmologies\n\nOrigen, a third-century Christian philosopher, speculated that God,\nbefore he created our universe, had busied himself with the creation\nof an endless series of earlier worlds. His idea of an eternal cyclic\nuniverse was however condemned by the church and has since then\ngenerally been regarded as associated with atheism and materialism.\nIndeed, from about 1850 to 1920 the classical cyclic or recurrent\nuniverse was popular among many atheistic thinkers who found it to be\nincompatible with Christian doctrines. Nonetheless, some theists have\nendorsed such a universe, e.g., Joseph Smith\u2019s claim that\n\u201cas one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so\nshall another come\u201d (Mormon Book of Moses 1:38).\n\nAlthough Einstein\u2019s cosmological field equations do not justify\na series of pulsating universes, many cosmologists have suggested ways\nin which a collapsing universe can reappear from a nonsingular state\nand thus give birth to a new universe, perhaps ad infinitum. It should\nbe pointed out that Lema\u00eetre, the cosmologist-priest, did\nnot suggest such a \u201cPhoenix universe,\u201d in spite\nof numerous claims to the opposite. In some cases atheism has been\npart of the motivation for proposing singularity-free models with an\nunlimited past and future. For example, the British physicist William\nBonnor considered the new big bang theory \u201cthe opportunity\nChristian theology has been waiting for ever since science began to\ndepose religion from the minds of rational men\u201d (Bonnor 1964,\n117). His own favored candidate, a universe oscillating smoothly and\neternally between two states of finitely high density, avoided a\ndivine miracle and theistic exploitation of cosmology, in which\nrespect it was similar to the steady-state theory. Steven Weinberg\nnoticed the similarity: \u201cSome cosmologists are philosophically\nattracted to the oscillating model, especially because, like the\nsteady-state model, it nicely avoids the problem of Genesis\u201d\n(Weinberg 1977, 154).\n\nClassical-relativistic cyclic models presupposed a closed universe\ndisagreeing with current observations, for which reason they are no\nlonger considered viable alternatives. But the twenty-first century\nhas witnessed several new proposals, of which we shall mention only\ntwo: the \u201cconformal cyclic cosmology\u201d developed by Roger\nPenrose, and the \u201cnew cyclic cosmology\u201d developed by Paul\nSteinhardt and Neil Turok.\n\nIn his theory of conformal cyclic cosmology, Penrose claims that as\nthe big bang is approached, massive objects play a negligible role, so\nthat the physics is governed by degrees of freedom that are invariant\nunder rescaling of lengths and times. Such degrees of freedom are\ncalled \u201cconformal invariants.\u201d Thus, Penrose claims, we\nmake a mistake to model the early universe by a Lorentzian manifold\nwith a metric (as is done in classical general relativity). Rather,\nspacetime should be described by a conformal manifold, which\nis essentially a conformal equivalence class of general relativistic\nspacetimes. The \u201ccyclic\u201d part of Penrose\u2019s cosmology\ncomes from noticing that the future of one ever-expanding universe can\nbe smoothly bridged to the past of another big-bang universe by means\nof such a conformal manifold. In this case, the big bang is not a true\nbeginning, but only a sort of phase change from one\n\u201cepoch\u201d to another (Penrose 2010).\n\nThe new cyclic cosmology of Steinhardt and Turok develops ideas from\nstring theory to describe a universe without inflation going through\nan endless sequence of cycles\u2014in which case, the big bang is not\nthe beginning of time (Steinhardt and Turok 2007). In this respect the\nmodel is similar to the steady-state model, and Steinhardt and Turok\nhave indeed described it as a \u201cremarkable reincarnation\u201d\nof Hoyle\u2019s old theory. Although the new cyclic model has\nattracted a fair amount of attention, it is not widely accepted. Nor\nis this the case with the pre-big-bang bouncing cosmology advanced by\nGabriele Veneziano and Maurizio Gasperini on the basis of string\ntheory. According to the pre-big-bang model the universe is not only\neternal into the future, it is also eternal into the past, the two\ncosmic phases (contracting and expanding) being separated by a\nnon-singular big bang.\n\nEternal bouncing models qualitatively similar to the pre-big-bang\nscenario have been proposed earlier, either on the basis of the\nrelativistic field equations or on the idea of a plasma universe.\nAccording to the Swedish physicist Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, a Nobel\nlaureate of 1970 who developed the latter idea, the plasma universe\nwas an alternative to the theistic big bang theory. Since none of the\nmodels considered in this section operate with an absolute beginning,\nthey may seem to be problematic from a theistic point of view.\nHowever, the theist can always appeal to perpetual divine creation,\njust as in the case of the steady-state universe.\n",
