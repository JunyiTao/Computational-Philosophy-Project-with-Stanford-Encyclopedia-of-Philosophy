    "main_text": "The Anti-Razor || Ockham\u2019s Criticism of the Chatton Principle\n3.3 Ockham\u2019s Criticism of the Chatton Principle\n\nOckham explicitly rejects this assumption as needlessly profligate and\nit is precisely on this point that he attacked the Chatton\n Principle.[7]\n Ockham\u2019s strategy for overcoming Chatton\u2019s (and\nScotus\u2019) realist results is two-fold: (1) he reforms the\nprinciple of contradictories by expansion; and (2) he capitalizes on\nthis expansion by offering an alternative semantic account\n(connotation theory) which explains what happens when a proposition\npasses from being true to being false.\n\nOckham opens up the principle of contradictories by deriving from the\nproposition, \u201cThere can be no passage from contradictory to\ncontradictory apart from the generation or corruption (of some\nthing)\u201d, the following expansion:\n\nIt is impossible for contradictories to be successively verified for\none and the same thing, except (i) on account of local motion of\nsomething, or (ii) on account of the passage of time, or (iii) on\naccount of the production or destruction of some thing. (Ockham,\nScriptum = OTh IV), I, d. 30, q. 1, p. 396, lines\n8\u20139)\n\n\nClearly this is just Scotus\u2019 principle of contradictories,\nexpressed in clause (iii), with clauses (i) and (ii) added by Ockham.\nThe thrust of Ockham\u2019s alteration is to recognize that there are\nmore ways to account for change in truth value besides changes in what\nthings there are; a change in time or a change of location can also\nexplain it. But, if Ockham\u2019s version is correct and\nScotus\u2019s is not, then Chatton\u2019s plurality argument using\nhis Principle will not go through: we don\u2019t have to posit that\n\\(n + 1\\) things exist if \\(n\\) things will not explain the truth of\nsome true proposition, since the truth may be adequately explained\nsimply by the passage of time or the occurrence of change. It is\nabsolutely clear that Ockham\u2019s expansion of the principle of\ncontradictories and Chatton\u2019s \u2018howsoever they are present\naccording to arrangement and duration\u2019 clause in version (2) of\nthe Principle above play off each other, and in these formulas we see\nsome of the intense mutual influence between Ockham and Chatton.\n\nNotice too that Chatton\u2019s clause essentially forces us to hold\ntime and movement as constants, and only then ask what would\nmake the true proposition true. In this way, he forces us to see that\na res must in fact be posited in such cases, since there is\nno change of place or lapse of time to explain the passage from\ncontradictory to contradictory. By itself this begs the question\nagainst Ockham, and Chatton\u2019s principle has no general leverage\nagainst Ockham. In the end the Chatton Principle had to be\nsupplemented with direct attacks on Ockham\u2019s alternative\nsemantics, viz., connotation theory.\n",
