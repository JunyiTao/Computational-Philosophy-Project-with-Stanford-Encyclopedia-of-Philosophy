    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Creativity || Preparation\n5.1 Preparation\n\nIt\u2019s myth that outsiders are more creative. To put yourself in a\nposition to create anything of value, you have to spend a great deal\nof time and effort acquiring the relevant knowledge, skills, and\nexpertise. In what has come to be called \u201cthe ten-year\nrule\u201d, Howard Gardner (1993) found that, on average, people\nspend about 10 years learning and being immersed in a domain before\nthey make any significant creative contribution to it.\n\nThough a certain amount of rote learning is required, gaining mastery\nin a field is not simply a matter of passively absorbing information.\nMuch of it involves what Anders Ericsson calls deliberate\npractice, where you focus on tasks which are a little beyond your\ncurrent abilities, but which you eventually conquer through feedback\nand repetition. Across a variety of domains\u2014including physics,\nmedicine, programming, dance, and music\u2014Ericsson found that, on\naverage, world-class performance becomes possible for people only\nafter 10,000 hours of deliberate practice in their chosen activity.\nThis finding also converges on the ten-year rule, because if you\nengage in deliberate practice four hours a day, five days a week, that\nwould add up to 10,000 hours in ten years (Ericsson, Krampe, &\nTesch-R\u00f6mer 1993; Ericsson et al. 2006).\n\nHowever, there seems to be a point at which too much formal training\ncan dampen creativity. Simonton (1984: 70\u201373) has reported that\nthe relationship between creativity and education level is an\ninverted-U, as too much schooling can reinforce familiar,\npre-established styles of thought. Even so, the point remains that,\nbefore you run into diminishing returns, years of preparatory learning\nand practice are required for exceptional creativity.\n",
