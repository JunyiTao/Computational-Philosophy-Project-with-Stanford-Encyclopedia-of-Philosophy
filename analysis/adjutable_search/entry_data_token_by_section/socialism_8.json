Socialists have also explored piecemeal reforms\nthat stop short of that structural change. An important historical\nexample is the combination of a market economy and the welfare\nstate. In this model, although property in the means of\nproduction remains private, and markets allocate most inputs and\noutputs of production, a robust governmental framework is put in place\nto limit the power of capitalists over workers and to improve the\nlife-prospects of the latter. Thus, social insurance addresses the\nrisks associated with illness, unemployment, disability, and old age.\nTax-funded, state provision of many of those goods that markets\ntypically fail to deliver for all is introduced (such as high-quality\neducation, public transportation, and health care). And collective\nbargaining gives unions and other instruments of workers\u2019 power\nsome sway on the determination of their working conditions, as well as\nproviding an important foundation for the political agency of the\nworking class (O\u2019Neill and White 2018).\n\nThis welfare state model was developed with great success during the\nthree decades after World War II, especially in Northern Europe, but\nalso, in weaker but significant forms, in other countries (including\nsome in the Global South). However, since the 1980s, this model has\nbeen in significant retreat, or even in crisis. Wealth and income\ninequality have been increasing dramatically during this time (Piketty\n2014; O\u2019Neill 2017). The financial sector has become extremely\npowerful and able largely to escape governmental regulation as\nglobalization allows capital to flow across borders. A \u201crace to\nthe bottom\u201d features states competing with each other to attract\ninvestment by lowering tax rates and other regulations, thus\nundermining states\u2019 ability to implement welfare policies (see,\ne.g., Dietsch 2015, 2018). Some socialists have seen this crisis as a\nreason to abandon the welfare state and pursue more comprehensive\nchanges of the kind discussed above. Others, however, have argued that\nthe model should be defended given that it has been proven to work\nquite well while the alternatives have uncertain prospects.\n\nOne example of the approach of extending or retrenching the mixed\neconomy and welfare state proposes a combination of two moves (Corneo\n2017: ch. 10, Epilogue, Appendix). The first move is to revamp the\nwelfare state by introducing mechanisms of greater accountability of\npoliticians to citizens (such as regulation of the dealings of\npoliticians with private companies, and more instances of direct\ndemocracy in order to empower citizens), an improvement of the quality\nof public services delivered by the welfare state (introducing\nexacting audits and evaluations and fostering the training and\nrecruitment of excellent civil servants), and international\ncoordination of tax policies to prevent tax competition and tax\nevasion. The second move in this proposal is to run controlled\nexperiments of market socialism to present it as a credible threat to\nthe powerful actors seeking to undermine the welfare state. This\nthreat would help stabilize the welfare state as the menace of\ncommunist revolution did after 1945. Specifically, welfare states\ncould create new institutions that would be relatively independent\nfrom governments and be run by highly competent and democratically\naccountable civil servants. \u201cSovereign Wealth Funds\u201d would\ninvest public money in well-functioning enterprises, to yield an equal\n\u201csocial dividend\u201d for citizens (on Sovereign Wealth Funds,\nsee also Cummine 2016, O\u2019Neill and White 2019). The second\ninstitution, a \u201cFederal Shareholder\u201d, would go further by\nusing some of these funds to buy 51% of the shares of selected\nenterprises and take the lead within their boards of directors or\nsupervisory boards. The objective would be to show that these\nenterprises (which would include significant participation of workers\nin their management, and ethical guidelines regarding environmental\nimpacts and other concerns) maximize profits and thus offer a\ndesirable and feasible alternative to the standard capitalist\nenterprise. Effectively, this strategy would run controlled\nexperiments of shareholder market socialism. The working population\nwould learn about the feasibility of market socialism, and capitalist\nopponents of welfare entitlements would be disciplined by fear of the\ngeneralization of such experiments to settle again for the welfare\nstate.\n\nAnother strategy is to introduce various experiments seeking to\nexpand the impact of social power (as different from\nstate and economic power) within society (as defined in sect. 1). (See\nsurvey in Wright 2010: chs. 6\u20137). A set of mechanisms would\ntarget the deepening of democracy. Forms of direct democracy could\nfoster citizens\u2019 deliberative engagement in decision-making, as\nexemplified by the introduction of municipal participatory budgeting\nin Porto Alegre, Brazil (which features citizens\u2019 assemblies\nidentifying priorities for public policy). The quality of\nrepresentative democracy can be enhanced (and its subservience to the\npower of capitalists decreased) by introducing egalitarian funding of\nelectoral campaigns (e.g., by giving citizens a sum of money to\nallocate to the parties they favor, while forcing parties to choose\nbetween getting funding from that source and any other\nsource\u2014such as corporations), and by creating random citizen\nassemblies to generate policy options which can then be subject to\nsociety-wide referenda (as in the attempt to change the electoral\nsystem in British Columbia in Canada). Finally, forms of associational\ndemocracy can be introduced that feature deliberation or bargaining\nbetween government, labor, business, and civil society groups when\ndevising national economic policies or when introducing regional or\nlocal (e.g., environmental) regulations. A second set of mechanisms\nwould foster social empowerment more directly in the economy. Examples\nare the promotion of the social economy sector featuring economic\nactivity involving self-management and production oriented to use\nvalue (as displayed, e.g., by Wikipedia and child care units in\nQuebec), an unconditional basic income strengthening people\u2019s\nability to engage in economic activities they find intrinsically\nvaluable, and the expansion of the cooperative sector. None of these\nmechanisms on its own would make a society socialist rather than\ncapitalist. But if we see societies as complex \u201cecologies\u201d\nrather than as homogeneous \u201corganisms\u201d, we can notice that\nthey are hybrids including diverse institutional logics. An increase\nin the incidence of social empowerment may significantly extend the\nsocialist aspects of a society, and even eventually make them dominant\n(a point to which we return in the next section).\n\nA final point worth mentioning as we close our discussion of dimension\nDII of socialism concerns the growing interest in addressing not only\nthe economic arena, but also the political and personal-private ones.\nSome scholars argue that classical socialists neglected the increasing\n\u201cfunctional differentiation\u201d of modern society into these\nthree \u201cspheres\u201d, concentrating in an unduly narrow way on\nthe economic one (Honneth 2015 [2017]). Thus, recent socialist work\nhas increasingly explored how to extend socialist principles to the\norganization of relatively autonomous governmental institutions and\npractices and to the shaping of intimate relationships among family\nmembers, friends, and lovers, as well as to the relations between\nthese diverse social arenas (see also Fraser 2009, 2014; Albert 2017).\nThere is, of course, also a long-standing tradition of feminist\nsocialism that has pushed for a wide scope in the application of\nsocialist ideals and a broader understanding of labor that covers\nproductive and reproductive activities beyond the formal workplace\n(see, e.g., Arruzza 2013, 2016; Dalla Costa and James 1972; Federici\n2012; Ehrenreich 1976 [2018]; Gould 1973\u20134; Rowbotham et al\n1979; Rowbotham 1998).\n",
