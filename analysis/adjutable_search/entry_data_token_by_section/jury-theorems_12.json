If diversity is small\u2014i.e.,\nindividuals reason similarly, use similar evidence, etc.\u2014then\njudgments are highly correlated. Without any diversity, judgments\ncoincide, and the correctness events \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) are\nequivalent. If diversity is high, then judgments correlate less.\nExtreme diversity corresponds to full independence\u2014or even to\nnegative correlation, to mention a rare but interesting possibility\n(Hong & Page 2009; 2012).\n\nCondorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem implicitly presupposes extensive\ndiversity by assuming independence. The Conditional and the\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem are less restrictive: they permit\nmore or less diversity, because their conditional\nindependence assumption is compatible with more or less\nunconditional independence.\n\nMany models of voter dependence have been proposed. A classical model\nintroduces an \u201copinion leader\u201d whose judgment each other\nindividual copies with some probability (Boland, Porschan, & Tong\n1989). Instead of a single opinion leader, the individuals could\ninfluence one another, as captured by pairwise correlations (e.g.,\nLadha 1992). The dependence structure could become yet more complex\nand escape a description in terms of pairwise correlations (Kaniovski\n2010; Pivato 2017).\n\nSome authors focus on the merits of diversity, by presenting theorems\nin which more independence (diversity) leads to better majority\ndecisions (e.g., Berg 1993; Ladha 1995). The mechanism at work is\nthis: more independence makes it more likely that errors of voters are\ncompensated by correctness of other voters. Many authors also present\njury theorems, showing that, despite some dependence or non-diversity,\ncrowds can be \u201cwise\u201d, in the sense of increasing\nreliability (e.g., Berg 1993) or asymptotic infallibility (e.g.,\nPivato 2017). The infallibility conclusion remains objectionable (cf.\n Section 2).\n\nModelling voter dependence in adequate, transparent and tractable ways\nremains a central challenge for future jury theorem research.\n",
