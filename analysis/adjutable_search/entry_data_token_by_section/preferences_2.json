    "main_text": "Preference logic || Completeness\n2.2 Completeness\n\nIn most applications of preference logic, it is taken for granted that\nthe following property, called completeness or\nconnectedness, should be satisfied:\n\n\\[\nA\\succcurlyeq B \\vee B\\succcurlyeq A\n\\]\n\n\nor equivalently:\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\vee A\\sim B \\vee B\\succ A\n\\]\n\n\nThe following weaker version of the property is sometimes useful: \n\n\\[\n\\text{If } A\\ne B, \\text{ then } \n A\\succcurlyeq B \\vee B\\succcurlyeq A \\quad\\text{(weak connectivity)}\n\\]\n\n(Completeness holds if and only if both weak\nconnectivity and reflexivity of indifference hold.)\n\n\nCompleteness (connectedness) is commonly assumed in many applications,\nnot least in economics. Bayesian decision theory is a case in point.\nThe Bayesian decision maker is assumed to make her choices in\naccordance with a complete preference ordering over the available\noptions. However, in many everyday cases, we do not have, and do not\nneed, complete preferences. Consider a person who has to choose\nbetween five available objects \\(A, B, C, D\\), and \\(E\\). If she knows\nthat she prefers \\(A\\) to the others, then she does not have to make\nup her mind about the relative ranking among \\(B, C, D\\), and\n\\(E\\).\n\nIn terms of resolvability, there are three major types of preference\nincompleteness. First, incompleteness may be uniquely\nresolvable, i.e. resolvable in exactly one way. The most natural\nreason for this type of incompleteness is lack of knowledge or\nreflection. Behind what we perceive as an incomplete preference\nrelation there may be a complete preference relation that we can\narrive at through observation, introspection, logical inference, or\nsome other means of discovery. \n\nSecondly, incompleteness may be multiply resolvable, i.e.\npossible to resolve in several different ways. In this case it is\ngenuinely undetermined what will be the outcome of extending the\nrelation to cover the previously uncovered cases.\n\nThirdly, incompleteness may be irresolvable. The most natural\nreason for this is that the alternatives differ in terms of advantages\nor disadvantages that we are unable to put on the same footing. A\nperson may be unable to say which she prefers\u2014the death of two\nspecified acquaintances or the death of a specified friend. She may\nalso be unable to say whether she prefers the destruction of the\npyramids in Giza or the extinction of the giant panda. In\nenvironmental economics, as a third example, it is a controversial\nissue whether and to what extent environmental damage is comparable to\nmonetary loss.\n\nTwo alternatives are called \u201cincommensurable\u201d whenever it\nis impossible to measure them with the same unit of measurement. Cases\nof irresolvable incompleteness are often also cases of\nincommensurability (Chang 1997). In moral philosophy, irresolvable\nincompleteness is usually discussed in terms of the related notion of\na moral dilemma.\n",
