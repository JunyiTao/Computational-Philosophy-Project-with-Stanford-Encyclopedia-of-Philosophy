    "main_text": "Writtenness\n4. Writtenness\n\nSome scholars believe that constitutional norms do not exist unless\nthey are in some way enshrined in a written document (e.g., Rubenfeld\n1998). But most accept that constitutions (or elements of them) can be\nunwritten, and cite, as an obvious example of this possibility, the\nconstitution of the United Kingdom. One must be careful here, however.\nThough the UK has nothing resembling the American Constitution and its\nBill of Rights, it nevertheless contains a number of written\ninstruments which have, for many centuries, formed central elements of\nits constitution. Magna Carta (1215 C.E.) is perhaps the earliest\ndocument of the British constitution, while others include The\nPetition of Right (1628) and the Bill of Rights (1689). Furthermore,\nconstitutional limits are also said to be found in certain principles\nof the common law, explicitly cited in landmark cases concerning the\nlimits of government power. The fact remains, however, that\nhistorically the constitution of the UK has largely taken unwritten\nform, suggesting strongly that writtenness is not a defining feature\nof constitutionalism.\n\nWhy, despite the existence of seemingly obvious counter-examples,\nmight someone be led to think that constitutional norms must be\nwritten rules, as opposed to more informal conventions or social\nrules? One possible\n reason[10]\n is that unwritten rules and conventions are sometimes less precise\nand therefore more open to interpretation, gradual change, and\nultimately avoidance, than written ones. If this were true, then one\nmight question whether an unwritten rule could, at least as a\npractical matter, serve adequately to limit government power. But\nthere is no reason to accept this line of argument. Long standing\nsocial rules and conventions are often clear and precise, as well as\nmore rigid and entrenched than written ones, if only because their\nelimination, alteration or re-interpretation typically requires\nwidespread changes in traditional attitudes, beliefs and behaviour.\nAnd these can be very difficult to bring about.\n",
