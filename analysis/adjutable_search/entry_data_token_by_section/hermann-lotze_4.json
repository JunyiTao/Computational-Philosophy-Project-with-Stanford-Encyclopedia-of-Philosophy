    "main_text": "Three Controversies || Vitalism\n3.3 Vitalism\n\nAs highlighted in the chronology, Lotze officially began as a student\nof medicine and, after attaining the doctorate in philosophy, he\nquickly followed with a degree in medicine, awarded for his\ndissertation De futurae biologiae principibus philosophicis\n(1838). There later commenced other medically-oriented works,\nincluding his Allgemeine Pathologie und Therapie als mechanische\nNaturwissenschaften (1st: 1842, 2nd: 1848), Allgemeine\nPhysiologie des K\u00f6rperlichen Lebens (1851), and\nMedicinische Psychologie, oder Physiologie der Seele (1852).\nLotze\u2019s output\u2014in and around the\nV\u00f6rmarz\u2014betrays a continuing preoccupation with\nboth the theory and application of the biological sciences in\nmedicine, physiology and psychology. But it is within this same time\nperiod that Lotze makes a fateful contribution, one later portrayed,\nby Lange, as his \u201cinvoluntary service to materialism.\u201d (Of\ncourse, from similar premises, Lotze drew sharply different\nconclusions than the materialistic thinkers he inadvertently\ninspired.) This \u201cservice\u201d was his trenchant attack on the\nconcept of \u201cvital force\u201d [Lebenskraft], widely\nheld, by a variety of thinkers of differing orientations, to have\nstruck the decisive blow (cf. Gregory, 1977, pp. 131f).\n\nLotze\u2019s medical dissertation was, under one description, his\nopening salvo in this attack, for in it he advocated the abandonment\nof key concepts of Naturphilosophie including, inter\nalia, \u201cpolarity\u201d and \u201cvital oscillation\u201d\n(cf. Woodward & Pester, 1994, p. 167 and Pester, 1997, p. 58). But\nhis targets also included the diagnostic terminology favored by the\nmedical nosology of the day\u2014most prominently,\n\u201casthenia\u201d (and its cognate notions) and, as already\nmentioned, \u201cvital force.\u201d While the former was a\ncontribution of the Brunonian theory, further elaborated in Germany by\nnumerous (and peculiar) enthusiasts, the latter was a more widespread\nassumption of biological thought generally speaking. Yet despite such\nimportant differences, both might be pegged with the same fundamental\nflaw: both could be characterized as empty \u201cabstractions\u201d\nthat falsely paraded as causally \u201cexplanatory\u201d notions.\nPut in Kantian terms, they were both treated (wrongly) as though they\nwere truly \u201cconstitutive\u201d principles of human\ncognition.\n\nTeleology, and teleological notions generally, while licit for certain\nheuristic purposes, pace Kant, cannot be raised to the level\nof cognitive principle. Hence, while enquiries into the biological\nrealm may safely assume purposive function, as a necessary theoretical\nposit, such assumptions may serve only as regulative\u2014not\nconstitutive\u2014principles in biological thought. Teleological\nnotions, such as \u2018order\u2019 and \u2018purpose\u2019, are,\nas necessary presuppositions of our theorization generally,\nineliminable. But such notions cannot be used explanatorily or, more\nprecisely, in a way that effectively precludes further investigation\ninto the actual causes of organic phenomena. In other words, from the\nperspective of scientific explanation itself, vital force has no role\nto play. Furthermore, philosophy itself always outstrips science and\nindicates \u201cthe need to go beyond what is already known and given\nin the direction of something as yet unknown and not given\u201d\n(Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 172).\n\nThe basic Kantian insight was further ramified by Lotze: mechanism and\nteleology are coexisting, compatible modes of explanation, each with\ntheir own proper sphere, and not contradictory opposites:\n\u201c[b]oth \u2026 are limited, and both imply one another.\nMechanism is therefore no power controlling reality, but rather the\nway in which a purposeful reality realizes itself\u201d (Robins,\n1900, p. 11). A lazy reliance on hypothetical posits, Lotze suspected,\nmerely betrays our unwillingness to engage in the difficult work of\nreal scientific discovery. Furthermore by \u201cmechanism\u201d\nLotze meant not a blind naturalistic or reductionist technique;\nrather, he used this word to signify a hypothetical-deductive method\nof explanation of phenomena (cf. Woodward & Pester, 1994, p. 165).\nThis has important ramifications for the emerging biological sciences:\nif the essence of science lies in the employ of the\nhypothetical-deductive method of explanation\u2014and not\nmathematization, as Kant had insisted\u2014then biology and medicine,\nfor instance, both might admit of a rigorous treatment worthy of the\nname \u2018science\u2019. Teleology does not replace explanation: it\nsupplements it (cf. Lenoir, 1982, pp. 168ff).\n\nHowever, materialists such as Czolbe were inspired by the elimination\nof vital force to continue metaphysical \u201chouse-cleaning\u201d\ninto the remaining parts of the super-sensual. But Lotze saw no\nconnection between the rightful rejection of empty, and hence,\nun-scientific notions, on the one hand, and respectable, metaphysical\nconcepts proper, on the other. And so, he believed it possible to be a\nphysiologist, investigating the brain and the nervous system, and a\nmetaphysician, of the soul, simultaneously. There is only one clear\nand consistent view in natural science: that of hypothetical-deductive\nphysical science. Within this framework, the notion of vital force is,\nas already noted, dispensable, replaceable by physico-chemical\nexplanations. This substitution had no effect, however, on the\nmetaphysical concepts of necessity, finality and purpose, which must\nboth be part of and govern any (proper) investigation. Materialism was\nthus forestalled, from Lotze\u2019s perspective, by his overriding\ncommitment to a value-theoretic teleology.\n\nWith this proviso firmly in mind, one would have to admit that a\nproperly scientific account could never rule out the existence of such\nthing as a \u201csoul.\u201d And yet traditional philosophical\nexplanations, rooted in the spontaneity of thought, in practical\nreason, or in the freedom of the will, argued Lotze, cannot suffice to\nestablish this \u201cuniversal prejudice.\u201d Nor may we rest\ncontent with the obvious fact that deductive explanations seem\nirrelevant when it comes to understanding mental life generally. There\nis, nonetheless, a \u201cdecisive fact of experience\u201d which may\nserve to legitimate this posit: the unity of consciousness\n(Micro, I, p. 152). But it is not our perception of unity\n(consciousness) that underwrites this ulterior unity (the soul).\nRather, \u201cour belief in the soul\u2019s unity rests not on our\nappearing to ourselves as a unity, but in our being able to appear to\nourselves at all\u201d (Micro, I, p. 157). As Lotze further\ndetails his (transcendental) argument: \u201cWe did not conclude that\nthe soul is one, because we appear to ourselves as a unity; but\n\u2026 by the fact that anything can appear to us\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 163). This, teleology is further supplemented\nby Kantian-style arguments which may further rebuff positivist\nimpulses to construe philosophical investigations as superfluous.\nPerhaps, for this reason, Lotze\u2019s views are sometimes\ncategorized under the very title that he, on occasion, used:\n\u201cteleological idealism\u201d (cf. Wagner, 1987, p. 75 &\nSchn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 177). Further, because Lotze comes to see\nnature itself as comprehensible as the life of a cosmic\nindividual\u2014or God\u2014the unity of consciousness is part and\nparcel of the ultimate unity of the very cosmos itself (cf. Santayana,\n1971, pp. 211ff).\n",
