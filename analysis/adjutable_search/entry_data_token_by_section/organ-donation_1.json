    "main_text": "Organ Retrieval from the Dead || Organ retrieval in practice\n1.1 Organ retrieval in practice\n\nIn nearly all countries with a transplantation program, the following\nis a broadly accurate description of organ retrieval in practice,\nalthough different countries, and regions of countries, do differ in\nnuanced ways, for instance in how the option of donation is presented\nto families; and the nuances may affect retrieval rates (T.M.\nWilkinson 2011).\n\nIf the deceased made a refusal known, either formally (e.g., on a\nregister) or informally, organs will not be retrieved.\nIf the family refuses, organs will not be retrieved.\nIf the deceased is not known to have refused, suitable organs will\nbe retrieved if the family agrees (some jurisdictions) or does not\nrefuse (other jurisdictions).\n\n\nThe first point to make from this description is that nearly all\ncountries have, in practice, a \u201cdouble veto\u201d system. Even\nif the family wants to donate, the deceased\u2019s objection will\nveto retrieval. Even if the deceased agreed to donate, the\nfamily\u2019s objection will veto retrieval. (The U.S. has partial\nexceptions discussed shortly.) The family\u2019s veto is in many\ncountries, such as the U.S., the U.K., and most nations of continental\nEurope, a creation of the medical profession. Doctors will not take\norgans from consenting dead people whose families object even though\nthe law permits retrieval. A lesson in method follows: when describing\nthe practice of organ retrieval, looking at the law alone is\ninadequate.\n\nA vital second point is that the consent of the deceased is not\nrequired before organs may be taken. (Japan was the last major\nexception and permitted retrieval without the deceased\u2019s consent from\n2010 \u2013 see the link to the Japan Organ Transplant Network in the\nOther Internet Resources section below.)  When the deceased has not\nrefused, the family\u2019s agreement is enough to permit\nretrieval.\n",
