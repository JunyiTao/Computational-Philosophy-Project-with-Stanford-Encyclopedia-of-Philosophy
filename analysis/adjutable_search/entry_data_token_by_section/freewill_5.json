    "main_text": "The Nature of Free Will || Compatibilist Accounts of Sourcehood\n2.4 Compatibilist Accounts of Sourcehood\n\nIn this section, we will assume that Frankfurt-style cases are\nsuccessful in order to consider two prominent compatibilist attempts\nto construct analyses of the sourcehood condition (though see the\nentry on\n compatibilism\n for a more systematic survey of compatibilist theories of free will).\nThe first, and perhaps most popular, compatibilist model is a\nreasons-responsiveness model. According to this model, an\nagent\u2019s action \\(\\phi\\) is free just in case the agent or manner\nin which the action is brought about is responsive to the reasons\navailable to the agent at the time of action. While compatibilists\ndevelop this kind of account in different ways, the most detailed\nproposal is due to John Martin Fischer (1994, 2006, 2010, 2012;\nFischer and Ravizza 1998. For similar compatibilist treatments of\nreasons-responsiveness, see Wolf 1990, Wallace 1994, Haji 1998, Nelkin\n2011, McKenna 2013, Vargas 2013, Sartorio 2016). Fischer and Ravizza\nargue that an agent\u2019s action is free and one for which he is\nmorally responsible only if the mechanism that issued in the action is\nmoderately reasons-responsive (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, ch. 3). By\n\u2018mechanism\u2019, Fischer and Ravizza simply mean \u201cthe\nway the action was brought about\u201d (38). One mechanism they often\ndiscuss is practical deliberation. For example, in the case of Jones\ndiscussed above, his decision to vote for Clinton on his own was\nbrought about by the process of practical deliberation. What must be\ntrue of this process, this mechanism, for it to be moderately\nreasons-responsive? Fischer and Ravizza maintain that moderate\nreasons-responsiveness consists in two conditions: reasons-receptivity\nand reasons-reactivity. A mechanism\u2019s reasons-receptivity\ndepends on the agent\u2019s cognitive capacities, such as being\ncapable of understanding moral reasons and the implications of their\nactions (69\u201373). The second condition is more important for us\nin the present context. A mechanism\u2019s reasons-reactivity depends\non how the mechanism would react given different reasons for\naction. Fischer and Ravizza argue that the kind of reasons-reactivity\nat stake is weak reasons-reactivity, where this merely requires that\nthere is some possible world in which the laws of nature remain the\nsame, the same mechanism operates, there is a sufficient reason to do\notherwise, and the mechanism brings about the alternative action in\nresponse to this sufficient reason (73\u201376). On this analysis,\nwhile Jones, due to the activity of Black, lacks the \u2018all-in\u2019 sense of\nthe ability to do otherwise, he is nevertheless morally responsible\nfor deciding to vote for Clinton because his action finds its source\nin Jones\u2019s practical deliberation that is moderately\nreasons-responsive.\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s theory of freedom and responsibility has shifted\nthe focus of much recent debate to questions of sourcehood. Moreover,\none might argue that this theory is a clear improvement over classical\ncompatibilism with respect to handling cases of phobia. By focusing on\nmechanisms, Fischer and Ravizza can argue that our agoraphobic Luke is\nnot morally responsible for deciding to refrain from going outside\nbecause the mechanism that issues in this action\u2014namely his\nagoraphobia\u2014is not moderately reasons-responsive. There is no\nworld with the same laws of nature as our own, this mechanism\noperates, and yet it reacts to a sufficient reason to go outside. No\nmatter what reasons there are for Luke to go outside, when acting on\nthis mechanism, he will always refrain from going outside (cf. Fischer\n1987, 74).\n\nBefore turning to our second compatibilist model, it is worth noting\nthat it would be a mistake to think that Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s\naccount is a sourcehood account to the exclusion of the ability to do\notherwise in any sense. As we have just seen, Fischer and\nRavizza place clear modal requirements on mechanisms that\nissue in actions with respect to which agents are free and morally\nresponsible. Indeed, this should be clear from the very idea of\nreasons-responsiveness. Whether one is responsive depends not merely\non how one does respond, but also on how one would respond.\nThus, any account that makes reasons-responsiveness an essential\ncondition of free will is an account that makes the ability to do\notherwise, in some sense, necessary for free will (Fischer [2018]\nconcedes this point, though, as noted above, the reader should\nconsider Sartorio [2016] as a potential counterexample to this\nclaim).\n\nThe second main compatibilist model of sourcehood is an identification\nmodel. Accounts of sourcehood of this kind lay stress on\nself-determination or autonomy: to be the source of her action the\nagent must self-determine her action. Like the contemporary discussion\nof the ability to do otherwise, the contemporary discussion of the\npower of self-determination begins with the failure of classical\ncompatibilism to produce an acceptable definition. According to\nclassical compatibilists, self-determination simply consists in the\nagent\u2019s action being determined by her strongest motive. On the\nassumption that some compulsive agents\u2019 compulsions operate by\ngenerating irresistible desires to act in certain ways, the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of self-determination implies that these\ncompulsive actions are self-determined. While Hobbes seems willing to\naccept this implication (1656 [1999], 78), most contemporary\ncompatibilists concede that this result is unacceptable.\n\nBeginning with the work of Harry Frankfurt (1971) and Gary Watson\n(1975), many compatibilists have developed identification accounts of\nself-determination that attempt to draw a distinction between an\nagent\u2019s desires or motives that are internal to the agent and\nthose that are external. The idea is that while agents are not (or at\nleast may not be) identical to any motivations (or bundle of\nmotivations), they are identified with a subset of their\nmotivations, rendering these motivations internal to the agent in such\na way that any actions brought about by these motivations are\nself-determined. The identification relation is not an\nidentity relation, but something weaker (cf. Bratman 2000, 39n12).\nWhat the precise nature of the identification relation is and to which\nattitudes an agent stands in this relation is hotly disputed.\nLippert-Rasmussen (2003) helpfully divides identification accounts\ninto two main types. The first are \u201cauthority\u201d accounts,\naccording to which agents are identified with attitudes that are\nauthorized to speak for them (368). The second are\nauthenticity accounts, according to which agents are identified with\nattitudes that reveal who they truly are (368). (But see\nShoemaker 2015 for an ecumenical account of identification that blends\nthese two accounts.) Proposed attitudes to which agents are said to\nstand in the identification relation include higher-order desires\n(Frankfurt 1971), cares or loves (Frankfurt 1993, 1994; Shoemaker\n2003; Jaworska 2007; Sripada 2016), self-governing policies (Bratman\n2000), the desire to make sense of oneself (Velleman 1992, 2009), and\nperceptions (or judgments) of the good (or best) (Watson 1975; Stump\n1988; Ekstrom 1993; Mitchell-Yellin 2015).\n\nThe distinction between internal and external motivations allows\nidentification theorists to enrich classical compatibilists\u2019\nunderstanding of constraint, while remaining compatibilists about free\nwill and determinism. According to classical compatibilists, the only\nkind of constraint is external (e.g., broken cars and broken legs),\nbut addictions and phobias seem just as threatening to free will.\nIdentification theorists have the resources to concede that some\nconstraints are internal. For example, they can argue that our\nagoraphobic Luke is not free in refraining from going outside even\nthough this decision was caused by his strongest desires because he is\nnot identified with his strongest desires. On compatibilist\nidentification accounts, what matters for self-determination is not\nwhether our actions are determined or undetermined, but whether they\nare brought about by motives with which the agent is identified:\nexercises of the power of self-determination consists in an\nagent\u2019s actions being brought about, in part, by an\nagent\u2019s motives with which she is identified. (It is important\nto note that while we have distinguished reasons-responsive accounts\nfrom identification accounts, there is nothing preventing one from\ncombing both elements in a complete analysis of free will.)\n\nEven if these reasons-responsive and identification compatibilist\naccounts of sourcehood might successfully side-step the Consequence\nArgument, they must come to grips with a second incompatibilist\nargument: the Manipulation Argument. The general problem raised by\nthis line of argument is that whatever proposed compatibilist\nconditions for an agent \\(S\\)\u2019s being free with respect to, and\nmorally responsible for, some action \\(\\phi\\), it will seem that\nagents can be manipulated into satisfying these conditions with\nrespect to \\(\\phi\\) and, yet, precisely because they are manipulated\ninto satisfying these conditions, their freedom and responsibility\nseem undermined. The two most influential forms of the Manipulation\nArgument are Pereboom\u2019s Four-case Argument (2001, ch. 4; 2014,\nch. 4) and Mele\u2019s Zygote Argument (2006, ch. 7. See Todd 2010,\n2012 for developments of Mele\u2019s argument). As the structure of\nMele\u2019s version is simpler, we will focus on it.\n\nImagine a goddess Diana who creates a zygote \\(Z\\) in Mary in some\ndeterministic world. Suppose that Diana creates \\(Z\\) as she does\nbecause she wants Jones to be murdered thirty years later. From her\nknowledge of the laws of nature in her world and her knowledge of the\nstate of the world just prior to her creating \\(Z\\), she knows that a\nzygote with precisely \\(Z\\)\u2019s constitution located in Mary will\ndevelop into an agent Ernie who, thirty years later, will murder Jones\nas a result of his moderately reasons-responsive mechanism and on the\nbasis of motivations with which he is identified (whatever those might\nbe). Suppose Diana succeeds in her plan and Ernie murders Jones as a\nresult of her manipulation.\n\nMany judge that Ernie is not morally responsible for murdering Jones\neven though he satisfies both the reasons-responsive and\nidentification criteria. There are two possible lines of reply open to\ncompatibilists. On the soft-line reply, compatibilists attempt to show\nthat there is a relevant difference between manipulated agents such as\nErnie and agents who satisfy their account (McKenna 2008, 470). For\nexample, Fischer and Ravizza propose a second condition on sourcehood:\nin addition to a mechanism\u2019s being moderately\nreasons-responsive, an agent is morally responsible for the output of\nsuch a mechanism only if the agent has come to take responsibility for\nthe mechanism, where an agent has taken responsibility for a mechanism\n\\(M\\) just in case (i) she believes that she is an agent when acting\nfrom \\(M\\), (ii) she believes that she is an apt target for blame and\npraise for acting from \\(M\\), and (iii) her beliefs specified in (i)\nand (ii) are \u201cbased, in an appropriate way, on [her]\nevidence\u201d (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 238). The problem with this\nreply is that we can easily imagine Diana creating Ernie so that his\nmurdering Jones is a result not only of a moderately\nreasons-responsive mechanism, but also a mechanism for which he has\ntaken responsibility. On the hard-line reply, compatibilists concede\nthat, despite initial appearances, the manipulated agent is free and\nmorally responsible and attempt to ameliorate the seeming\ncounterintuitiveness of this concession (McKenna 2008, 470\u201371).\nHere compatibilists might point out that the idea of being manipulated\nis worrisome only so long as the manipulators are interfering with an\nagent\u2019s development. But if the manipulators simply create a\nperson, and then allow that person\u2019s life to unfold without any\nfurther inference, the manipulators\u2019 activity is no threat to\nfreedom (McKenna 2008; Fischer 2011; Sartorio 2016, ch. 5). (For other\nresponses to the Manipulation Argument, see Kearns 2012; Sripada 2012;\nMcKenna 2014.)\n",
