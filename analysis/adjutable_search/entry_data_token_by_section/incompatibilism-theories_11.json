    "main_text": "Agent-Causal Theories || Causation by a Substance\n3.3 Causation by a Substance\n\nAll theorists who accept a causal construal of agents\u2019 control\nover what they do\u2014and this includes most compatibilists as well\nas many incompatibilists\u2014can accept that agents cause their free\nactions (or events internal to these actions). After all, we accept\nthat the sun causes sunburn and that, when water dissolves sugar, it\ncauses the sugar to dissolve. However, it is widely thought that\ncausation by such things is reducible to, or consists wholly in,\ncausation by states of these things or events involving them, and this\nis precisely what is denied with respect to the agent causation that\nis invoked by agent-causal theories of free will. The denial raises\nthe question whether any intelligible account of agent causation can\nbe given. Even some proponents of agent-causal views (e.g., Taylor\n1992: 53) seem doubtful about this, declaring agent causation to be\nstrange or even mysterious.\n\nSuch doubts may be viewed in light of the widely held presumption\nthat, free will (or perhaps, more broadly, purposive agency) aside,\ncausation throughout nature is, fundamentally, causation by events or\nstates. Until recently, even most proponents of agent-causal theories\nhave accepted this view. And with this view granted, an appeal to\nagent causation in a theory of free will may strike us an implausible\nclaim of metaphysical exceptionalism.\n\nIn the last couple of decades, however, a growing number of\nphilosophers have argued that causation by substances is ontologically\nfundamental. Some (e.g., Jacobs and O\u2019Connor 2013; Lowe 2008:\n143\u201346; O\u2019Connor 2014; and Swinburne 1997 and 2006) hold that,\nfundamentally, all causation is substance causation. Others (e.g.,\nAlvarez and Hyman 1998; Hyman 2015: 40\u201342; Mayr 2011: 229\u201330; and\nSteward 2012: 207\u201316) advance causal pluralism, on which entities of a\nvariety of different categories\u2014the list includes substances,\nevents, properties, features, aspects, and facts\u2014cause things,\nand causation by each of these kinds of thing is equally fundamental.\nThe pluralist picture is not one of competition but of\ninterdependence; as it may be put, events cause things only when the\nsubstances in which these events are changes cause those things, and\nsubstances cause things only when changes in those substances cause\nthose things. (Hyman [2015: 41] suggests a similar view.)\n\nOften such views are advanced on grounds that are entirely independent\nof free will or purposive agency, having to do with the nature of\ncausation and causal powers generally. Substance causation that is\nontologically fundamental is held to be pervasive, constituting the\nactivity of substances animate and inanimate, macro and micro.\nRejection of the view that causation by events or states is uniquely\nfundamental often stems from a turn away from of a broadly Humean\naccount of causation toward a neo-Aristotelian view, one that takes\ncausal powers to be irreducible features of the world.\n\nIn the context of a view of this kind, an appeal to causation by\nagents that is ontologically fundamental is no claim of metaphysical\nexceptionalism. Further, on a causal pluralist view, an agent-causal\ntheorist can help herself to an understanding of acting for a reason\nin terms of causation by one\u2019s recognition of reasons. For it\nmay be said that a free action is caused by the agent and caused by\ncertain states of the agent, with causation by each of these things\ninterdependent and equally fundamental. The verdict on such a view\nhinges on the tenability of its general account of causation.\n\nAt the same time, if the activity of every substance\u2014an\nelectron, an oak tree\u2014consists in fundamental substance\ncausation, the worry arises whether agent causation can provide what\nfree-will theorists who appeal to it have thought it could provide:\norigination, and the agent\u2019s determining, herself, which of\nseveral open alternatives she pursues. After all, on the view in\nquestion, an electron, too, may be an undetermined determinant of what\nit does. Perhaps, in the end, the difference between the electron and\nthe free agent isn\u2019t a matter of the agent being the ultimate\nsource of her behavior, but rather in the purposiveness involved in\nagent causation.\n",
