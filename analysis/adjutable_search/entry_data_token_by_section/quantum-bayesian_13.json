    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Other Objections and Replies\n2.7 Other Objections and Replies\n\nOther objections to QBism may be found in Brown (2019) and Zwirn\n(forthcoming).\n\nAccording to Brown (2019, p. 75) \u201c\u2026a variant of\nBerkeleyan idealism suffuses QBism.\u201d QBists insist on the\nexistence of a real world in which agents and their experiences are\nembedded, along with rocks, trees and everything else in the usual\nworld of common experience. But they deny that quantum mechanics\nitself describes this world, while hoping eventually to infer more\nabout it from our successful use of quantum mechanics to anticipate\neach of our experiences when acting on it. Brown objects to the\ncurrently ineffable character of the world for a QBist, contrasting\nthis unfavorably with the way a realist about a quantum state can use\nit to describe the physical world and explain how it gives rise to our\nexperiences by affecting our brains.\n\nBrown also objects to the QBists\u2019 understanding of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, assuming they consider this to track\nchanges not in the physical state of a quantum system but in what an\nagent believes she is likely to experience were she to act on it. But\nQBists understand this equation as a normative constraint on an\nagent\u2019s belief state at a single time, not as a constraint on\nhow that state evolves (see\n \u00a71.2).\n\nBrown further questions QBist entitlement to divide up the external\nworld, either into subsystems or spatiotemporally, complaining that\n\u201cThat part of QBism which relates to \u2018a theory of\nstimulation and response\u2019 between the agent and the world is not\ngrounded in known physics.\u201d (2019, p. 81)\n\nBarzegar (2020) has replied to Brown\u2019s objections. His reply\nincludes a defense of a claim by Fuchs (2017, p. 118) that Brown\n(2019) sought to refute\u2013\u2013the claim that QBism is pursuing\nEinstein\u2019s (1949) program of \u201cthe real\u201d.\n\nFollowing a largely sympathetic sketch of QBism, Zwirn (forthcoming,\n\u00a710) highlights ways in which some of its key notions remain\nunclear. Regarding quantum mechanics as an extension of subjective\nprobability theory, QBists (DeBrota and Stacey (2019), see\n Other Internet Resources)\n reject the demand to provide a reductive definition of the notion of\nan agent. Zwirn presses this demand because in this context the agent\nis not merely a passive witness: \u201cIt is the interaction between\nan agent and the external world that creates a result. Without agent,\nthere is no result.\u201d\n\nZwirn (forthcoming) also challenges QBists to clarify their key\nconcepts of world and experience: \u201cQBism\nendorses the existence of an external world independent of any agent,\nbut it is not clear if the external world is unique and shared by all\nagents or if each agent has her own external world.\u201d\n\nZwirn believes that his own view of Convivial Solipsism (Zwirn 2016,\n2020) improves on QBism because it provides clear answers to these\nchallenging questions. In his view an agent is something whose\nconscious experiences are produced by a common external physical\nworld, but organized into that agent\u2019s personal external\nworld.\n",
