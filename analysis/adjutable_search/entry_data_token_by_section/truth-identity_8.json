    "main_text": "Difficulties with the Theory and Possible Solutions || The individuation problem\n5.5 The individuation problem\n\nIt might appear that we individuate propositions more finely than\nfacts: for example, one might argue that the fact that Hesperus is\nbright is the same fact as the fact that Phosphorus is\nbright, but that the propositions in question are different (see\non this point K\u00fcnne 2003: 10\u201312; Candlish & Damnjanovic\n2018: 266\u20137). The identity theorist has a number of strategies\nin response to this objection. One would be simply to deny it, and\nmaintain that facts are individuated as finely as propositions: if one\nis a supporter of the Fregean version of the identity theory, this is\nlikely to be one\u2019s response (see, e.g., Dodd 2008a: 90\u20133).\nAlternatively, one might respond by saying that, if there is a good\npoint hereabouts, at best it tells only against the Fregean and\nRussellian versions of the identity theory, not against the hybrid\nversion. The identity theory in the hybrid version can agree that we\nsometimes think of facts as extensional, reference-level entities and\nsometimes also individuate propositions or proposition-like entities\nintensionally. Arguably, these twin points do indeed tell against\neither a strict Fregean or a strict Russellian version of the identity\ntheory: they tell against the strict Fregean position because, as well\nas individuating facts intensionally, we also, sometimes, individuate\nfacts extensionally; and they tell against the strict Russellian\nposition because, as well as individuating facts extensionally, we\nalso, sometimes, individuate facts intensionally. But it is plausible\nthat the hybrid version of the identity theory is not touched by the\nobjection, because that version of the theory accommodates\npropositionally structured and factual entities at both levels of\nsense and reference, though different sorts of these entities at these\ndifferent levels\u2014either propositions at the level of sense and\ncorrelative proposition-like entities at the level of reference or\nvice versa, and similarly, mutatis mutandis, for\nfacts and fact-like entities. It will follow, then, for this version\nof the identity theory, that Fregean thoughts and Russellian\npropositions are available, if true, to be identical with the factual\nentities of the appropriate level (sense and reference, respectively),\nand the individuation problem will not then, it seems, arise.\nPropositions or propositionally structured entities will be\nindividuated just as finely as we want them to be individuated, and at\neach level of resolution there will be facts or fact-like entities,\nindividuated to the same resolution, for them to be identical with, if\n true.[15]\n",
