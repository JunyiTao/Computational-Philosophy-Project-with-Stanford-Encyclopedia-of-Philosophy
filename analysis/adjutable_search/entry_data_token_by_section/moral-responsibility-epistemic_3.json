    "main_text": "Responses to Revisionism\n3. Responses to Revisionism\n\nVolitionists argue that the intuitive thought that responsibility\nrequires awareness, pursued to its ultimate consequences, subverts\nordinary judgments of blameworthiness. So, in order to respond to the\nrevisionist interpretation of the EC, that intuitive thought needs to\nbe reexamined. Responses to revisionism vary according to how much\nthey are willing to depart from it. Some philosophers agree that\nresponsibility requires awareness, but argue that the requisite\nawareness doesn\u2019t necessarily involve an occurrent\nbelief concerning the action\u2019s overall wrongness\n (sect. 3.1,\n \u2018Weakened internalism\u2019). Other philosophers claim that,\nwhile awareness of wrongdoing is required for culpability for actions,\nsuch awareness isn\u2019t required when it comes to assessing\nculpability for ignorance itself\n (sect. 3.2,\n \u2018Ignorance and epistemic vices\u2019). A third group maintains\nthat the required awareness concerns only the factual aspects of\none\u2019s action, not the moral ones, at least not conceived in a\nde dicto way\n (sect. 3.3,\n \u2018Quality of will\u2019). Finally, some philosophers contend\nthat in certain cases awareness isn\u2019t required at all: agents\ncan be blameworthy for fully unwitting acts provided that certain\nother conditions are met\n (sect. 3.4,\n \u2018Capacitarianism\u2019). Despite their differences, what these\npositions have in common is the goal of denying the akrasia\nrequirement on blameworthiness.\n",
