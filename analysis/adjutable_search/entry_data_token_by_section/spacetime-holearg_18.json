    "main_text": "Broader Significance of the Hole Argument || The Hole Argument and the Quantization of Gravity\n10.2 The Hole Argument and the Quantization of Gravity\n\nOne of the most tenacious problems in modern theoretical physics is\nthe quantization of gravity. While Einstein\u2019s 1915 general\ntheory of relativity produced a revolutionary new way of thinking of\ngravitation in terms of the curvature of spacetime, it is generally\nagreed now that it cannot be the final account of gravity. The reason\nis that it is still a classical theory. It does not treat matter in\naccord with the quantum theory.\n\nThe problem of bringing quantum theory and general relativity together\nin a single theory remains unsolved. (See\n Quantum Gravity.)\n There are many contenders, notably string theory and loop quantum\ngravity. One of the issues that has been raised is that the hole\nargument has shown us (so goes the claim) that no successful theory of\nquantum gravity can be set against an independent, container\nspacetime. John Stachel was an early proponent of this outcome of the\nhole argument. See Stachel (2006). This issue has often been raised by\nloop quantum gravity theorists specifically as a criticism of string\ntheoretic approaches, for string theoretic approaches have such a\nbackground spacetime. See Rovelli and Gaul (2000) and Smolin (2006);\nfor philosophical engagement with these issues of \u201cbackground\nindependence\u201d, see Pooley (2017) and Read (2023).\n\nIn a related development, Gryb and Th\u00e9bault (2016) have argued\nthat the problem of the hole argument and the \u201cproblem of\ntime\u201d of quantum gravity are essentially the same, given\nsuitable assumptions. For more, see\n Problem of Time\n in the article on quantum gravity.\n",
