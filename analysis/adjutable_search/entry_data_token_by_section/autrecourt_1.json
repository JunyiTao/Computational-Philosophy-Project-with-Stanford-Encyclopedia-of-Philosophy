    "main_text": "Autrecourt\u2019s Trial and Conviction\n2. Autrecourt\u2019s Trial and Conviction\n\n\nAutrecourt\u2019s time of trial began in 1340 when he was first summoned\nto appear before the papal court in Avignon and lasted until his\nconviction in 1346. An extensive, though as yet incomplete, dossier of\nthe judicial process at Avignon has been preserved in the form of an\ninstrumentum publicum (actually, a draft copy thereof), which\nserved as a model for the preparation of the official record of the\nprocess. The papal dossier contains copies of a number of records that\nplayed a role during earlier stages of Autrecourt\u2019s trial, and gives an\naccount (narratio) of the judicial proceedings from the moment\nCardinal Curti, the judge, took over the investigation.\n\n\nThe record specifies the charges and summarizes the false teachings\nof which Autrecourt was accused in the form of four lists, together\ntotalling 66 erroneous propositions or \u201carticles\u201d (articuli).\nThe articles were culled from Autrecourt\u2019s writings and oral teachings.\nOn the basis of this record, it would appear that the papal commissions\nof Pope Clement VI and Cardinal Curti used evidence from earlier\nproceedings at the University of Paris and Autrecourt\u2019s response to\nthis evidence to reach their verdicts. If this scenario is correct, it\nraises two obvious questions: why was Autrecourt\u2019s trial transferred\nfrom Paris to Avignon, and how did it begin in the first place?\nUnfortunately, the surviving historical evidence is insufficient to\nanswer either question.\n\n\nThe commission of prelates and theologians, which under the\nchairmanship of Cardinal Curti had discussed all of the articles\nattributed to Autrecourt, came to the conclusion that they contained\nmany false, dangerous, presumptuous, suspect, erroneous, and heretical\nstatements. For this reason, Autrecourt\u2019s writings were ordered burned\neither at Pr\u00e9-aux-Clercs or Pr\u00e9-de-Saint-Germain at Paris\nat an unspecified future date. Moreover, Autrecourt was ordered to\npublicly recant several of the articles specified in the legal record.\nThese recantations and declarations, which Autrecourt was first\nrequired to make at the palace of Cardinal Curti in Avignon, had to be\nrepeated at the University of Paris. Autrecourt\u2019s recantation at the\npapal court took place before May 19, 1346. The exact date is unknown\nbecause it was left blank in the draft prepared by the notary Bernard.\nIn addition to the recantation, Autrecourt was declared unworthy to\nascend to the magisterial rank in the theological faculty. Anyone in\npossession of the authority to present or promote Autrecourt to the\nmagisterium of the faculty of theology was thereafter forbidden to do\nso.\n\n\nThe Parisian part of the sentence was fulfilled the following year.\nOn November, 20, 1347 the regent and non-regent masters of the\nuniversity met at the Church of Saint-Mathurin, where papal letters\nand the process \u201cconcerning certain articles\u201d were\nread. This material had been brought from Avignon by Autrecourt\nhimself. On November 25, Autrecourt recanted the four confessed\narticles and the articles from the letter \u201cVe\nmichi\u201d in the Church of the Dominicans, and publicly\ndeclared that the propositions contained in the other two lists were\nwrong. In addition, he burned these articles and a treatise, most\nlikely the Exigit ordo. The public reading of the\ninstrumentum and the recantation served an important purpose.\nIt not only made the sentence effective, but also informed the\nscholarly community of Autrecourt\u2019s errors and of the punishments set\nout in the instrumentum, which they would incur if they were\nto teach the censured errors. Years later, scholars such as John\nBuridan, Marsilius of Inghen, and Andr\u00e9 of Neufch\u00e2teau\n(Andreas de Novo Castro) cited the condemned erroneous propositions as\nthe articuli cardinalis (albi).\n",
