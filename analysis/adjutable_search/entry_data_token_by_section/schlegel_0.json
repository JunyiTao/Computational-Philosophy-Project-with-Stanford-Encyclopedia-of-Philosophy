    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nThe youngest of five sons, Schlegel was born in Hanover into a\ndistinguished and culturally prominent literary family. His father,\nJohann Adolf Schlegel, was both a clergyman and literary figure; his\nuncle, Johann Elias, was a dramatist and aesthetic theorist; and his\nelder brother by five years, August Wilhelm, was to become the great\nGerman translator of Shakespeare and one of the most prominent\nliterary critics of the time.\n\nSchlegel attended the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and Leipzig,\noriginally to study law, but his intellectual interests began to\nwiden, centering especially on classical literature, and he turned\nafter 1793 to a life of literary freelancing. In the succeeding couple\nof years, he wrote several early essays on Greek literature amid plans\nfor a history of classical poetry. Only one volume of the intended\nlarger study was published, in 1798, as Geschichte der Poesie der\nGriechen und R\u00f6mer, but the essay \u201cOn the Study of\nGreek Poetry\u201d (\u00dcber das Studium der griechischen\nPoesie, finished 1795, but not published until January 1797),\nwith its sharp distinction between ancient and modern modes of\nliterature, is taken to be representative of this early,\n\u201cclassicist\u201d phase of Schlegel\u2019s intellectual life.\n\nAn important influence on the young Schlegel was Caroline B\u00f6hmer,\nfuture wife of his brother (and ultimately of F. W. J. Schelling).\nSchlegel met her initially in 1794 in Dresden, and her life\nexperience\u2014the daughter of a famous G\u00f6ttingen professor,\nshe had become pregnant by a French officer in occupied Mainz and been\nimprisoned as a revolutionary\u2014had a particular effect on the\nawakening of his interest in political and social issues. In the\nsummer of 1796, Schlegel moved to join his brother and new wife in\nJena, the city which, since Fichte\u2019s momentous arrival two years\nprior, had become perhaps the liveliest intellectual scene in all of\nGermany. Schlegel remained in Jena for almost a year, but then moved\nto Berlin, where he became a regular visitor to the salons of\nHenriette Herz and Rahel Levin and established contact with several\nimportant figures of the Romantic movement. Among them were Friedrich\nSchleiermacher, who became Schlegel\u2019s roommate and collaborator on a\nnumber of intended projects, including the translation of Plato\u2019s\ndialogues (a project that in the end only Schleiermacher would\nactually carry out); the writers Ludwig Tieck and Wilhelm Heinrich\nWackenroder; and the poet Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis), who had\nbeen a fellow student with Schlegel in Leipzig and who was partly\nresponsible for opening up the philosophical problems of Fichtean\nidealism to the young Schlegel.\n\nAmong the works most famously associated with Schlegel\u2019s name from\nthis period is the project of the journal Athenaeum, which\npublished in the years 1798\u20131800 a set of fragments written by\nboth Schlegel brothers, Novalis and Schleiermacher. During his time in\nBerlin, Schlegel also began a relationship with Dorothea Veit,\ndaughter of Moses Mendelssohn, who had left her banker husband Simon\nVeit in 1798. The publication in 1799 of Schlegel\u2019s novel\nLucinde, with its frank (though by today\u2019s standards hardly\nrisqu\u00e9) portrayal of a sexual liaison widely thought to be\nautobiographical became for Schlegel a major scandal.\n\nIn September 1799, Schlegel left Berlin to join his brother and\nCaroline again in Jena. He gave lectures on transcendental philosophy\nat the University of Jena from October 1800 to March 1801, although\nthese were apparently not well-received. (Among those in the audience\nfor some of those lectures was probably Hegel, newly arrived in Jena,\nbut there is considerable dispute about what Hegel\u2014a bitter\nrival of Schlegel\u2019s for the remainder of his life\u2014may or may not\nhave gained from hearing them.)\n\nSchlegel remained in Jena until December 1801, and his departure on\nthis occasion came at a time which marks a significant turning point\nin the history of Romanticism: the end of the \u201cJena\ncircle\u201d and its collaborations. Novalis had died in March, and\nSchlegel had become somewhat distanced from his brother and Caroline.\nAfter a time in both Berlin and Dresden, Schlegel moved to Paris in\nJune 1802, where he founded another new journal, Europa, and\nturned significant attention to the figurative arts. Among other\nthings, Schlegel wrote accounts of the paintings in the Louvre and\nbegan, at the behest of the notable art collectors Sulpiz and Melchior\nBoisser\u00e9e, a series of lectures on art and art history.\n\nSchlegel and Dorothea moved to Cologne in 1804, where Schlegel studied\nGerman Gothic architecture, gave lectures on the development of\nphilosophy (Die Entwicklung der Philosophie) and turned, with\nsome hopes of finally establishing himself in an academic position, to\na new intellectual interest: the study of Sanskrit and Hindu religious\nwritings. Schlegel\u2019s work on the grammatical connections between\nSanskrit and the Indo-European languages, published as On the\nLanguage and Wisdom of the Indians (\u00dcber die Sprache und\nWeisheit der Indier, 1808), represents an important moment in the\ndevelopment of the study of comparative grammar (a term which Schlegel\nhimself coined in the text).\n\nThe study of Hindu thought marked an important shift in the\ndevelopment of Schlegel\u2019s religious thought, as did a second and\nimportant event of the Cologne period: his conversion, together with\nDorothea, to Catholicism, in April 1808. The shift in Schlegel\u2019s\nreligious stance corresponded with an apparently new political one as\nwell.\n\nIn March of 1809 he was appointed to a position in the Austrian civil\nservice and moved to Vienna, where he was to live for the rest of his\nlife.\n\nDuring these Austrian years, Schlegel was, among other things, the\neditor of an anti-Napoleonic newspaper, founder of two other prominent\njournal projects (the Deutsches Museum and\nConcordia) and an apparently popular public lecturer on a\nwide range of topics. Metternich asked him in 1813 to draw up\nproposals for a future German constitution, and Schlegel served (until\nhe was recalled) as first secretary of the Austrian legation to the\nDiet of Frankfurt. He died in Vienna in January 1829.\n",
