    "main_text": "Life and Works || The life of John Duns the Scot\n1.1 The life of John Duns the Scot\n\n\u2018Scotus\u2019 identifies Scotus as a Scot. His family name was\nDuns, which was also the name of the Scottish village in which he was\nborn, just a few miles from the English border. We do not know the\nprecise date of his birth, but we do know that Scotus was ordained to\nthe priesthood in the Order of Friars Minor\u2014the\nFranciscans\u2014at Saint Andrew\u2019s Priory in Northampton,\nEngland, on 17 March 1291. The minimum age for ordination was\ntwenty-five, so we can conclude that Scotus was born before 17 March\n1266. But how much before? The conjecture, plausible but by no means\ncertain, is that Scotus would have been ordained as early as\ncanonically permitted. Since the Bishop of Lincoln (the diocese that\nincluded Oxford, where Scotus was studying, as well as St\nAndrew\u2019s Priory) had ordained priests in Wycombe on 23 December\n1290, we can place Scotus\u2019s birth between 23 December 1265 and\n17 March 1266.\n\nScotus studied philosophy and then theology at Oxford beginning some\ntime in the 1280s. In the academic year 1298\u201399 he commented on\nthe first two books of the Sentences of Peter Lombard. Scotus\nleft Oxford for Paris, probably in 1302, and began lecturing on the\nSentences again (we think in the order Book I, Book IV, Book\nII, Book III). In June 1303 Scotus was expelled from France along with\neighty other friars for taking Pope Boniface VIII\u2019s side in a\ndispute with King Philip IV of France. After Boniface died in October\n1303 the king allowed the exiled students and masters to return, so\nScotus could have returned in the late fall of 1303 to resume his\nlectures on the Sentences. Scotus became Doctor of Theology\nin 1305 and was Franciscan regent master at Paris in 1306\u201307. He\nwas transferred to the Franciscan studium at Cologne,\nprobably beginning his duties as lector in October 1307. He died there\nin 1308; the date of his death is traditionally given as 8\nNovember.\n",
