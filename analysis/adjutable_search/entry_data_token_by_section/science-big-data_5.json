    "main_text": "Big Data, Knowledge and Inquiry\n6. Big Data, Knowledge and Inquiry\n\nLet us now return to the idea of data-driven inquiry, often suggested\nas a counterpoint to hypothesis-driven science (e.g., Hey et al.\n2009). Kevin Elliot and colleagues have offered a brief history of\nhypothesis-driven inquiry (Elliott et al. 2016), emphasising how\nscientific institutions (including funding programmes and publication\nvenues) have pushed researchers towards a Popperian conceptualisation\nof inquiry as the formulation and testing of a strong hypothesis. Big\ndata analysis clearly points to a different and arguably Baconian\nunderstanding of the role of hypothesis in science. Theoretical\nexpectations are no longer seen as driving the process of inquiry and\nempirical input is recognised as primary in determining the direction\nof research and the phenomena\u2014and related\nhypotheses\u2014considered by researchers.\n\nThe emphasis on data as a central component of research poses a\nsignificant challenge to one of the best-established philosophical\nviews on scientific knowledge. According to this view, which I shall\nlabel the theory-centric view of science, scientific\nknowledge consists of justified true beliefs about the world. These\nbeliefs are obtained through empirical methods aiming to test the\nvalidity and reliability of statements that describe or explain\naspects of reality. Hence scientific knowledge is conceptualised as\ninherently propositional: what counts as an output are claims\npublished in books and journals, which are also typically presented as\nsolutions to hypothesis-driven inquiry. This view acknowledges the\nsignificance of methods, data, models, instruments and materials\nwithin scientific investigations, but ultimately regards them as means\ntowards one end: the achievement of true claims about the world.\nReichenbach\u2019s seminal distinction between contexts of discovery\nand justification exemplifies this position (Reichenbach 1938).\nTheory-centrism recognises research components such as data and\nrelated practical skills as essential to discovery, and more\nspecifically to the messy, irrational part of scientific work that\ninvolves value judgements, trial-and-error, intuition and exploration\nand within which the very phenomena to be investigated may not have\nbeen stabilised. The justification of claims, by contrast, involves\nthe rational reconstruction of the research that has been performed,\nso that it conforms to established norms of inferential reasoning.\nImportantly, within the context of justification, only data that\nsupport the claims of interest are explicitly reported and discussed:\neverything else\u2014including the vast majority of data produced in\nthe course of inquiry\u2014is lost to the chaotic context of\n discovery.[2]\n\nMuch recent philosophy of science, and particularly modelling and\nexperimentation, has challenged theory-centrism by highlighting the\nrole of models, methods and modes of intervention as research outputs\nrather than simple tools, and stressing the importance of expanding\nphilosophical understandings of scientific knowledge to include these\nelements alongside propositional claims. The rise of big data offers\nanother opportunity to reframe understandings of scientific knowledge\nas not necessarily centred on theories and to include\nnon-propositional components\u2014thus, in Cartwright\u2019s\nparaphrase of Gilbert Ryle\u2019s famous distinction, refocusing on\nknowing-how over knowing-that (Cartwright 2019). One way to construe\ndata-centric methods is indeed to embrace a conception of knowledge as\nability, such as promoted by early pragmatists like John Dewey and\nmore recently reprised by Chang, who specifically highlighted it as\nthe broader category within which the understanding of\nknowledge-as-information needs to be placed (Chang 2017).\n\nAnother way to interpret the rise of big data is as a vindication of\ninductivism in the face of the barrage of philosophical criticism\nlevelled against theory-free reasoning over the centuries. For\ninstance, Jon Williamson (2004: 88) has argued that advances in\nautomation, combined with the emergence of big data, lend plausibility\nto inductivist philosophy of science. Wolfgang Pietsch agrees with\nthis view and provided a sophisticated framework to understand just\nwhat kind of inductive reasoning is instigated by big data and related\nmachine learning methods such as decision trees (Pietsch\n2015). Following John Stuart Mill, he calls this approach\nvariational induction and presents it as common to both big\ndata approaches and exploratory experimentation, though the former can\nhandle a much larger number of variables (Pietsch 2015: 913). Pietsch\nconcludes that the problem of theory-ladenness in machine learning can\nbe addressed by determining under which theoretical assumptions\nvariational induction works (2015: 910ff).\n\nOthers are less inclined to see theory-ladenness as a problem that can\nbe mitigated by data-intensive methods, and rather see it as a\nconstitutive part of the process of empirical inquiry. Arching back to\nthe extensive literature on perspectivism and experimentation (Gooding\n1990; Giere 2006; Radder 2006; Massimi 2012), Werner Callebaut has\nforcefully argued that the most sophisticated and standardised\nmeasurements embody a specific theoretical perspective, and this is no\nless true of big data (Callebaut 2012). Elliott and colleagues\nemphasise that conceptualising big data analysis as atheoretical risks\nencouraging unsophisticated attitudes to empirical investigation as a\n\n\n\n\u201cfishing expedition\u201d, having a high probability of leading\nto nonsense results or spurious correlations, being reliant on\nscientists who do not have adequate expertise in data analysis, and\nyielding data biased by the mode of collection. (Elliott et al. 2016:\n880)\n\n\nTo address related worries in genetic analysis, Ken Waters has\nprovided the useful characterisation of \u201ctheory-informed\u201d\ninquiry (Waters 2007),\nwhich can be invoked to stress how theory informs the methods used to\nextract meaningful patterns from big data, and yet does not\nnecessarily determine either the starting point or the outcomes of\ndata-intensive science. This does not resolve the question of what\nrole theory actually plays. Rob Kitchin (2014) has proposed to see big data\nas linked to a new mode of hypothesis generation within a\nhypothetical-deductive framework. Leonelli is more sceptical of\nattempts to match big data approaches, which are many and diverse,\nwith a specific type of inferential logic. She rather focused on the\nextent to which the theoretical apparatus at work within big data\nanalysis rests on conceptual decisions about how to order and classify\ndata\u2014and proposed that such decisions can give rise to a\nparticular form of theorization, which she calls classificatory theory\n(Leonelli 2016).\n\nThese disagreements point to big data as eliciting diverse\nunderstandings of the nature of knowledge and inquiry, and the complex\niterations through which different inferential methods build on each\nother. Again, in the words of Elliot and colleagues, \n\n\nattempting to draw a sharp distinction between hypothesis-driven and\ndata-intensive science is misleading; these modes of research are not\nin fact orthogonal and often intertwine in actual scientific practice.\n(Elliott et al. 2016: 881, see also O\u2019Malley et al. 2009,\nElliott 2012)\n\n",
