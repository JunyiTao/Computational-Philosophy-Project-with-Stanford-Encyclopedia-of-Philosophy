Content, Givenness, and Space and Time\n\nThe rejection of cognitive dualism raises a rather vexing problem for\nMaimon: if the content of cognition is not to be found in the\naffection of the merely passive faculty of sensibility, where does the\ncontent come from? On the face of it, of course, it seems clear that\nhumans are not wholly responsible for the world of experience, but\nrather encounter it; Maimon must provide some explanation of the\n\u2018given\u2019 content of experience without appealing to\nsomething like the Kantian cognitive dualism he finds so\nproblematic.\n\nAlthough the details of Maimon\u2019s answer to this problem remain\nobscure, the kernel of his position can be found in his analysis of\nwhat it is to be a finite cognizer. While Kant moves from the fact of\nour human finitude to the need for a \u2018given\u2019 element of\ncognition, Maimon claims that such a step need not be taken. Instead\nof characterizing finitude in terms of the need for a passive faculty\nof receptivity, Maimon insists that finitude only implies\nincompleteness in our cognition \u2014 but this incompleteness does\nnot warrant any conclusions about the provenance of the matter of\ncognition. The content of sensibility is simply that which is passive\nin cognition \u2014 namely, that upon which the understanding\noperates. The expression that content is given from \u2018outside of\nus,\u2019 Maimon writes, means only \u201csomething in a\nrepresentation of which we are conscious of no spontaneity, that is,\n(in view of our consciousness) a mere passivity without\nactivity.\u201d And, he continues, the word \u2018given\u2019\nsignifies not \u201csomething in us that has its cause outside of us\n\u2026 rather, [the given] means merely a representation, whose\nmanner of origin in us is unknown to us.\u201d (GW II, 203 |\nVT 203) What we take to be merely given to us in experience can in\nfact be explained in terms of a productive \u2014 and hence active\n\u2014 capacity of the mind, although the procedures of this activity\nremain unknown to us.\n\nIn this respect Maimon revives the Leibnizian notion that there is not\na difference in kind, but only in degree, between a finite and an\ninfinite intellect. Maimon argues that for an infinite intellect, all\nof the content of thought is consciously produced through the\nmind\u2019s own activity \u2014 by virtue of its infinity, nothing\nneeds to be given to such an intellect. By the same token, Maimon\nholds that we can think of finite cognizers in the same terms, but\nwith the crucial difference that finite minds are not aware of the\nproductive capacities that create the matter of experience. The\nsupposedly given content provided by sensibility, in other words, can\nin fact be explained in terms of the \u2018subconscious\u2019\nproductive capacities of the active mind. In this respect, Maimon\nargues that our minds are limited reflections of the divine or\ninfinite mind; our active powers are conscious, he claims, in\nmathematics, where we display a \u2018god-like\u2019 ability to\ncreate content according to rules of thought. Mathematical objects,\nthat is, are constructed according to the complete determinations of\nour concepts, rather than merely encountered in our sensible\ninteractions with the world. In the case of empirical content,\nhowever, the creative process remains uncognized, since the\n\u2018manner of origination\u2019 of empirical objects or the\ncomplete conceptual determination that guides construction remains\nunknown to us.\n\nThese \u2018subconscious\u2019 products become conscious to the\nfinite mind, Maimon claims, by being represented in space and time.\nThe contrast with Kant is again important, for while Kant claims that\nspace and time are forms of human intuition, Maimon maintains that\nspace and time are in fact the ways in which humans represent\nconceptual differences between thoughts. Space and time, that is,\n\u201care both concepts and intuitions, and the latter presupposes\nthe former.\u201d (GW II, 18 | VT 18) Space and time are concepts as\nrepresentations of the differences of things in general, but they are\nintuitions when they represent a particular sensible object in\nrelation to other sensible objects. As finite cognizers, we represent\nin space and time what we have not completely conceptualized. The fact\nthat we represent content spatially and temporally indicates only that\nthere is some incompleteness in our conception of the world, and not\nthat this content is provided by a realm of wholly independent\nobjects. Maimon claims that the representations of space and time as\nintuitions arise as the result of the faculty of imagination, which\nis, as he describes it, the faculty of fictions (GW III, 61 | PW 37).\nSpace and time are then taken to be fictions in that they add\nproperties to objects that are not present in the conceptual\ndetermination of these objects (for a sustained discussion of\nMaimon\u2019s more general treatment of philosophical fictions, which\nMaimon views as practically indispensable for our ordinary cognition,\nsee Breazeale (2017)). As such, they serve as \u201cnegative\ncriteria\u201d for the incompleteness of our knowledge of objects (GW\nV, 192 | VnL 134). Although we never have complete determination, we\ndo get nearer to the complete concept of an object. The fact\nthat we represent objects in space and time points to the fact that\nsomething remains to be determined \u2014 spatial or\ntemporal diversities, that is, must have their ground in some\nconceptual differences. The representations of space and time provide\nindications that \u201cthe concepts of experience, and consequently\nalso the determined relations of objects of experience, are\nincomplete.\u201d (GW V, 192 | VnL 134)\n\nThis emphasis on the fictional nature of spatial and temporal\nproperties again echoes the Leibnizian explanation of space and time\nas the representation of conceptual differences, but where Leibniz\nclaims that space and time are derived from monadic relations, Maimon\nargues that the intuitions of space and time are in fact a\npriori human forms of representation, or, in Maimon\u2019s\nterms, \u2018forms of difference\u2019. In order to represent an\nobject in space and time, Maimon maintains, the conceptual content\nthat grounds such a representation must contain a diversity in order\nto be represented spatially and temporally. An intuited visual field\nof homogeneous red, for example, would not be spatially represented,\nsince there would not be any diversity present. Spatiality would arise\nonly with the introduction of some distinct content \u2014 a spot of\ngreen in the red field, for example (for a very helpful account of\nMaimon\u2019s theory of fictions, see Schmid 2021).\n\nFor Maimon, the formal nature of space and time suffices to\nyield mathematical and geometric necessity. In mathematics, Maimon\nclaims, space and time are given a priori to the\nfaculty of cognition; the objects of mathematics are \u201cnothing\nbut space and time in all their possible modifications.\u201d\n(GW V, 184 | VnL 126) Mathematics, that is, relates to an\nobject given a priori, or rather \u201citself determines these\nobjects a priori.\u201d (GW V, 183 | VnL 125) The\nobjects of mathematics and geometry are then directly constructed or\ndetermined according to the understanding\u2019s a priori\nrules of production. For Maimon, as for Kant, the ground of the a\npriority and necessity of geometry and arithmetic lies in the need for\nthe construction and exhibition of concepts.\n\nSpace and time are then presented as a priori \u2018forms of\ndifference,\u2019 but a question remains about the content of\nexperience: the supposedly independent world of objects, in all of its\nvariety and multiplicity, still needs to be explained. On this\nquestion, unfortunately, Maimon\u2019s position is particularly\nobscure. In the Versuch \u00fcber die\nTranscendentalphilosophie, Maimon develops a theory about the\ncontent of experience in terms of what he calls \u2018infinitesimals\nof perception.\u2019 Here the invocation of the calculus is\ndeliberate, for he argues that the content of experience can be\nexplained in terms analogous to the way in which infinitesimals are\ntreated in mathematics. A line, for example, can be understood as\ncomposed of an infinite number of points, each of which stands in\nrelation to the others; moreover, these points are densely ordered,\nfor there are an infinite number of points between any two points. But\nwhile the differences between the points of the line are themselves\ninfinitely small, the relation between them is a determinate value\n\u2014 the slope, which can be calculated for any point on the line.\nLikewise, Maimon claims, the content of experience can be understood\nas analogous to a \u2018perceptible line\u2019 that is composed of\nan infinite number of smaller components, none of which is\nontologically distinct from the experience itself. On this view,\n\u201csensibility provides the differentials to a determined\nconsciousness; the imagination produces from these [differentials]\nfinite (determinate) objects of intuition; the understanding produces\nfrom the relations of these different differentials, which are its\nobjects, the relation from which arise sensible objects.\u201d\n(GW II, 31\u20132 | VT 31\u20132) In this sense, there is\n\u2014 at least in principle \u2014 no need to appeal to a content\ngiven from outside of experience; instead, experience is itself\ncomposed or \u2018integrated\u2019 from the posited infinitesimal\nelements of thought. As finite cognizers, we represent in\nspace and time the purely conceptual differences that are simply\npresented in thought. (A similar strategy for dealing with the problem\nof the thing-in-itself was developed a century later by the Marburg\nNeo-Kantians, especially Hermann Cohen.)\n\nThe theory of the infinitesimals of perception is both complex and\nexceedingly opaque, and perhaps for this reason it largely disappears\nfrom Maimon\u2019s later work (for more on infinitesimals, see Duffy\n2014). But despite its gradual diminution in Maimon\u2019s thought,\nthe spirit it reflects continues to be expressed in Maimon\u2019s\nsteadfast commitment to his \u2018skeptical rationalism\u2019. Both\nhis objections to Kant\u2019s account of cognition as well as his own\npositive project turn on a rejection of what might be called\n\u2018brute givens.\u2019 For Maimon, givenness stands in opposition\nto cognition, for he holds that no explanation can be provided for how\nmerely given content can be taken up in thought \u2014 how, that is,\nthe active faculties of thought can legitimately apply to a passively\nreceived given. By attempting to explain givenness within a larger\nframework of an active consciousness, Maimon presents a position that\navoids \u2014 at least in principle \u2014 the problems that Maimon\nsees with Kant\u2019s cognitive dualism.\n",
