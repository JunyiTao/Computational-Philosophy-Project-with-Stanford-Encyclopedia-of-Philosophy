    "main_text": "Philosophical Psychology || Memory\n5.2 Memory\n\nMemory is considered in the western tradition to be an important means\nby which an individual can justify her beliefs about the past. It is\nstriking then to note that the Ny\u0101ya at the outset separate\nmemory states from knowledge-yielding beliefs and deny to them the\nstatus of knowledge-hood. The Manual of Reason has the\nfollowing to say about memory:\n\n\nA memory state is one which results solely from a \u2018mental\ndisposition\u2019 (bh\u0101van\u0101) (TS 35).\n\nA \u2018mental disposition\u2019 is a quality of the soul which is\ncaused by a nonrecollective cognition and causes a memory cognition\n(TS 80).\n\nMemories are either \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019, as the\noriginating cognition is true or false (TS 74).\n\n\nThe general theory is that an initial cognition, e.g. a perceptual\nexperience of an object, generates a dispositional mental state, which\nhas the capacity, when certain other causal factors are present, to\ntrigger an active memory of that object. (The whole process might be\nlikened to that of someone who, having learned to swim, has a\ndispositional capacity to swim, which they exercise on certain\noccasions.) The resultant memory state has the same content as the\noriginating perceptual experience, and can be said derivatively to be\n\u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019, depending on whether the\noriginal perception was veridical or not. Memory, on this account is\nrepresented as an entirely infallible faculty: there is no mention of\nthe possibility of what is called \u201cfalse memory\u201d, i.e.\nhaving memories without any originating experience, or of\n\u201cfaulty memory\u201d, in which the content of the memory does\nnot exactly match that of the originating experience.\n\nGiven this account, in which memory is seen merely as reproducing a\npast knowing experience, there is perhaps a sense in which the memory\ndoes not itself count as knowledge, any more than an exact\nreproduction of a Picasso counts as a Picasso. The Naiy\u0101yikas\nstate that memories lack \u2018independence\u2019. The idea,\nperhaps, is this. In general we establish the veracity of an\nexperience by examining the way in which it was caused (my perception\nof the table is veridical, because my eyesight is good, the lighting\nis adequate, etc.). In the case of a memory, however, we must go via\nthe originating experience. Memory is conceived of as a mere surrogate\nfor the original experience, and its veracity is\n\u2018dependent\u2019 on that of the original. We might think,\nhowever, that memory in fact does more than merely reproduce the\noriginal experience. It may represent the experienced event as\nhappening in the past, and thus have a different content.\n",
