    "main_text": "Ethics and Political Philosophy || Art as Intrinsically Ethical\n4.1 Art as Intrinsically Ethical\n\nAs we have seen above, Henry explicitly ascribes an ethical function\nto art. This involves two essential concepts: that of life\u2019s\n\u201cself-growth\u201d (auto-accroissement) and that of\nthe bond between the living and absolute life (the latter concept\nbeing especially important in his philosophy of religion). Self-growth\ndescribes the movement inherent to life, namely \u201cthe living\n\u2018me\u2019\u201d itself (AP 295). Such a movement, however, is\nnot simply the continuation of an unchanging state. Self-experience is\nprimarily an experience (\u00e9preuve) of passivity, of\npathos in Henry\u2019s terminology: We have neither brought ourselves\ninto existence nor do we continue to make ourselves exist. On the\ncontrary, it is absolute life that engenders itself \u201cin\u201d\nus. But for the same reason, the experience of passivity is one of the\n\u201cweight\u201d of subjectivity, leading to the urge to deploy\nsubjective powers. Perhaps in analogy with intentional acts that seek\nfulfillment in intuition, Henry\u2019s concept of self-growth refers,\non the level of immanent affectivity, to subjectivity seeking the\ndevelopment of its powers in the \u201cI can\u201d:\n\n\nEach eye [\u2026] wants to see more. Culture exists when this\nprescription\u2014which is the energy of vision\u2014is followed in\nthis display of what is seen and in the creation of this display. What\nis now entirely clear to us is that this energy resides in vision as\nsuch. That is to say that it resides [\u2026] in its self-growth, in\nwhat has been called its will to power. (B 100\u20131)\n\n\nIn this context, the work of art appears as a possible mediation\ntoward such a subjective self-growth, both for the artist and the\nspectator. Art, however, is not limited to this intensification of\nsubjectivity. It functions at the same time as a\n\u201creminder\u201d of the bond between the living and absolute\nlife, and this, according to Henry, is precisely the function of\nethics, namely \u201cto make us relive this forgotten bond\u201d (AP\n296). By taking religio in its etymological sense as\n\u201cbond\u201d, Henry\u2019s aesthetics are therefore not only\nintrinsically ethical but also intrinsically religious. \u201cArt is\nby its very nature ethical\u201d, just as it is \u201ca form of\nreligious life\u201d (AP 297), a conclusion that for Henry is\ncompatible with a Christian as well as Nietzschean approach to art.\nHowever, since aesthetics is not only concerned with art but\nencompasses all sensible experience, it is not only art that is\nethically relevant but everything that affects sensibility, and this\nincludes the world as a whole given its organization in cultural forms\nand traditions (B 102\u20133). For this reason, Henry\u2019s\ncritique of contemporary culture has to be seen as an important part\nof his approach to ethics.\n",
