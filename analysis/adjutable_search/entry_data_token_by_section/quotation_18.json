    "main_text": "Alternative Quotational Devices || Dot Quotes\n6.3 Dot Quotes\n\nSomeone who uses the word \u2018red\u2019 in speaking or thinking\nwould generally be held to be employing the same concept as a French\nperson who uses \u2018rouge\u2019. Assuming that \u2018rouge\u2019\nis a good translation of \u2018red\u2019, Sellars (1963) thought it\nconvenient to have a general term by which to classify words that are\nfunctional counterparts in this way. Such a term is provided by\nSellars\u2019 dot quotes. Dot-quotes form a common noun true of items\nin any language that play the role performed in our language by the\ntokens exhibited between them, so any expression that is a functional\ncounterpart to \u2018red\u2019 can be described as a\n\u0387red\u0387. In Sellars\u2019 terminology,\nthe concept red is something that is common and peculiar to\n\u0387red\u0387s.\n",
