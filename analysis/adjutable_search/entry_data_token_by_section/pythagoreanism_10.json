In his early years,\nhowever, he was a Pythagorean, and he is one of the most important\nsources for early Pythagoreanism. He wrote five works on\nPythagoreanism, although it is possible that some of these titles are\nalternative names for the same work: The Life of Pythagoras,\nOn Pythagoras and His Associates, On the Pythagorean\nLife, Pythagorean Precepts and a Life of\nArchytas. None of these works have survived intact, but portions\nof them were preserved by later authors (Wehrli 1945). Aristoxenus is\na valuable source because, as a member of the Lyceum, he is free of\nthe distorted image of Pythagoras propagated during his lifetime by\nPlato\u2019s successors in the Academy (see below, sect. 4.1) and\nbecause of his unique connections to Pythagoreanism. \n\nHe was born in Tarentum during the years when the most important\nPythagorean of the fourth century, Archytas, was the leading public\nfigure and his father, Spintharus, had connections to Archytas (Fr. 30\nWehrli). When Aristoxenus left Tarentum, as a young man, and\neventually came to Athens (ca. 350), his first teacher was the\nPythagorean, Xenophilus, before he went on to become the pupil of\nAristotle (Fr. 1 Wehrli). Some modern scholars are skeptical of\nAristoxenus\u2019 testimony, seeing his denial that there was a\nprohibition on eating beans and his assertion that Pythagoras was not\na vegetarian and particularly enjoyed eating young pigs and tender\nkids (Fr. 25 = Gellius IV 11), as attempts to make Pythagoreanism more\nrational than it was (Burkert 1972a, 107, 180). On the other hand, his\nLife of Archytas is not a simple panegyric; Archytas\u2019\nfoibles are recognized and his opponents are given a fair hearing. On\nAristoxenus as a source for Pythagoreanism see most recently Zhmud\n2012b and Huffman 2014b, 285\u2013295.\n\nPerhaps Aristoxenus\u2019 most interesting work on Pythagoreanism is\nthe Pythagorean Precepts, which is known primarily through\nsubstantial excerpts preserved by Stobaeus (Frs. 33\u201341 Wehrli).\nThis work does not mention any Pythagoreans by name but presents a set\nof ethical precepts that \u201cthey\u201d (i.e. the Pythagoreans)\nproposed concerning the various stages of human life, education, and\nthe proper place of sexuality and reproduction in human life. There\nare also analyses of concepts important in ethics, such as desire and\nluck. Given Aristoxenus\u2019 background, the Precepts would\nappear to be invaluable evidence for Pythagorean ethics in the first\nhalf of the fourth century, when Aristoxenus was studying\nPythagoreanism. They might be expected to partially embody the views\nof his teacher Xenophilus. The standard scholarly view of this work,\nhowever, is that Aristoxenus plundered Platonic and Aristotelian ideas\nfor the glory of the Pythagoreans (Wehrli 1945, 58 ff.; Burkert 1972a,\n107\u2013108; Zhmud 2012a, 65). There are serious difficulties with\nthe standard view, however (Huffman 2019). The analysis of luck that\nwas supposedly taken from Aristotle is, in fact, in sharp conflict\nwith Aristotle\u2019s view (Mills 1982) and appears to be one of the\nviews Aristotle was attacking. While the Precepts do have\nsimilarities to passages in Plato and Aristotle, they are at a very\nhigh level of generality and are shared with passages in other fifth\nand fourth century authors, such as Xenophon and Thucydides; it is the\ndistinctively Platonic and Aristotelian features that are missing.\n\nThe Precepts are thus best regarded as what they appear on\nthe surface to be, an account of Pythagorean ethics of the fourth\ncentury. This ethical system shows a similarity to a conservative\nstrain of Greek ethics, which is also found in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, but has its own distinctive features (Huffman\n2019). The central outlook of the Precepts is a distrust of\nbasic human nature and an emphasis on the necessity for supervision of\nall aspects of human life (Fr. 35 Wehrli). The emphasis on order in\nlife is so marked that the status quo is preferred to what is\nright (Fr. 34). The Pythagoreans were particularly suspicious of\nbodily desire and analyzed the ways in which it could lead people\nastray (Fr. 37). There are strict limitations on sexual desire and the\npropagation of children (Fr. 39). Despite the best efforts of\nhumanity, however, many things are outside of human control, so the\nPythagoreans examined the impact of luck on human life (Fr. 41).\n\nAristoxenus is a source for the famous story of the two Pythagorean\nfriends Damon and Phintias, which was set during the tyranny of\nDionysius II in Syracuse (367\u2013357). As a test of their\nfriendship Dionysius falsely accused Phintias of plotting against him\nand sentenced him to death. Phintias asked time to set his affairs in\norder, and Dionysius was amazed when Damon took his place, while he\ndid so. Phintias showed his equal devotion to his friend by showing up\non time for his execution. Dionysius cancelled the execution and asked\nto become a partner in their friendship but was refused (Iamblichus,\nVP 234; Porphyry, VP 59\u201360; Diodorus X\n4.3).\n\nIn Diodorus\u2019 version, Phintias is presented as actually engaged\nin a plot against Dionysius and some argue that Aristoxenus\u2019\nversion is an attempt to whitewash the Pythagoreans (Riedweg 2005,\n40). On the other hand, Dionysius\u2019 eagerness to join in their\nfriendship, which occurs in both versions, is harder to understand if\nthere really had been a plot (see Burkert 1972a, 104). There are two\nother considerations. First, Aristoxenus cites Dionysius II himself as\nhis source, whereas it is unclear what source Diodorus used. Second,\nit is far from clear that Aristoxenus would object to the Pythagoreans\nplotting against a tyrant. Thus, there are good reasons for regarding\nAristoxenus\u2019 version as more accurate.\n\nCleinias and Prorus are another pair of Pythagorean friends, whose\nstory may have been told by Aristoxenus (Iamblichus, VP 127),\nalthough they were not friends in the usual sense. Cleinias, who was\nfrom Tarentum, knew nothing of Prorus of Cyrene other than that he was\na Pythagorean, who had lost his fortune in political turmoil. On these\ngrounds alone he went to Cyrene, taking the money to restore\nProrus\u2019 fortunes (Iamblichus, VP 239; Diodorus X 4.1).\nNothing else is known of Prorus, although some pseudepigrapha were\nforged in his name (Thesleff 1965, 154.13). It appears that Cleinias\nwas a contemporary of Plato, since Aristoxenus reports that he and an\notherwise unknown Pythagorean, Amyclas, persuaded Plato not to burn\nthe books of Democritus, on the grounds that it would do no good,\nsince they were already widely known (Diogenes Laertius IX 40).\nCleinias was involved in several other anecdotes. Like Archytas he\nsupposedly refused to punish when angry (VP 198) and, when\nangered, calmed himself by playing the lyre (Athenaeus XIV 624a).\nAsked when one should resort to a woman he said \u201cwhen one\nhappens to want especially to be harmed\u201d (Plutarch,\nMoralia 654b). Several pseudepigrapha appear in\nCleinias\u2019 name as well.\n\nMyllias of Croton and his wife Timycha appear in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue and are known from a famous anecdote of uncertain origin,\nwhich is preserved by Iamblichus (VP 189 ff.). They were\npersecuted by the tyrant Dionysius II of Syracuse, but Timycha showed\nher loyalty and courage by biting off her tongue and spitting it in\nthe tyrant\u2019s face, rather than risk divulging Pythagorean\nsecrets under torture.\n\nNone of the Pythagoreans mentioned in the previous four paragraphs\nappear to have to have anything to do with the sciences or natural\nphilosophy. Since their Pythagoreanism consists exclusively in their\nway of life, they are best regarded as examples of the\nacusmatici. Many scholars have regarded Diodorus of Aspendus\nin Pamphylia (southern Asia Minor), as an important example of what\nthe Pythagorean acusmatici were like in the first half of the\nfourth century (Burkert 1972a, 202\u2013204). Diodorus is primarily\nknown through a group of citations preserved by Athenaeus (IV 163c-f),\nwhich describe him as a vegetarian who was outfitted in an outlandish\nway, some features of which later became characteristic of the Cynics,\ne.g., long hair, long beard, a shabby cloak, a staff and\nbeggar\u2019s rucksack (cf. Diogenes Laertius VI 13). The historian\nTimaeus (350\u2013260), however, casts doubt on Diodorus\u2019\ncredentials as a Pythagorean saying that \u201che pretended to have\nassociated with the Pythagoreans\u201d and Sosicrates, another\nhistorian (2nd century BCE; fragments in Jacoby) says that his\noutlandish dress was his own innovation, since before this\nPythagoreans had always worn white clothing, bathed and wore their\nhair according to fashion (Athenaeus IV 163e ff.). Iamblichus, the\nother major source for Diodorus outside Athenaeus, also treats\nDiodorus with reserve, saying that he was accepted by the leader of\nthe Pythagorean school at the time, one Aresas, because there were so\nfew members of the school. He continues, perhaps again with\ndisapproval, to report that Diodorus returned to Greece and spread\nabroad the Pythagorean oral teachings.\n\nThese sources clearly suggest that Diodorus was anything but a typical\nPythagorean, even of the acusmatic variety. Burkert has\nargued that this reflects a bias of sources such as Aristoxenus, who\nwanted to make Pythagoreanism appear reasonable and emphasized the\nversion of Pythagoreanism practiced by the math\u00eamatici\nrather than the acusmatici. In support of this conclusion, he\nargues that the two earliest sources present Diodorus as a Pythagorean\nwithout any qualifications (1972a, 204). It is important to look\ncarefully at those sources, however. First, neither is a philosopher\nor a historian, who might be expected to give a careful presentation\nof Diodorus. The oldest is a lyre player named Stratonicus (died 350\nBCE), who was famous for his witticisms, and the other, Archestratus\n(fl. 330 BCE), wrote a book entitled The Life of Luxury,\nwhich focused on culinary delights. Such sources might be expected to\naccept typical stories that went around about Diodorus without any\nclose analysis.\n\nIn the case of our earliest source, Stratonicus, there is, moreover,\nonce again evidence suggesting that Diodorus was not regarded as a\ntypical Pythagorean. In describing Diodorus\u2019 relationship to\nPythagoras, Stratonicus does not use a typical word for student or\ndisciple, but rather the same word (pelat\u00eas) that Plato\nused in the Euthyphro to describe the day-laborer who died at\nthe hands of Euthyphro\u2019s father. Diodorus is thus being\npresented sarcastically as a hired hand in the Pythagorean tradition,\nwhich is very much in accord with the later presentations of him as a\npoor man\u2019s Pythagoras on the fringes of Pythagoreanism. Thus,\nrather than accusing the sources of bias against Diodorus, it seems\nbetter to accept their almost universal testimony that he was not a\ntypical acusmatic but rather a marginal figure, who used\nPythagoreanism in part to try to gain respectability for his own\neccentric lifestyle.\n\nIndividuals known as \u201cPythagorists,\u201d i.e. Pythagorizers,\nare ridiculed by writers of Greek comedy, such as Alexis, Antiphanes,\nAristophon, and Cratinus the younger, in the middle and second half of\nthe fourth century (see Burkert 1972a, 198, n. 25 for the evidence and\n200, n. 41 for the dating). The most important of the fragments of\nthese comedies that deal with the Pythagorists are collected by\nAthenaeus (IV 160f ff) and Diogenes Laertius (VIII 37\u201338). The\nterm \u201cPythagorist\u201d is usually negative in the comic\nwriters (Arnott 1996, 581\u2013582) and picks out people who share\nsome of the same extreme ascetic lifestyle as Diodorus. A fragment of\nAntiphanes describes someone as eating \u201cnothing animate, as if\nPythagorizing\u201d (Fr. 133 Kassel and Austin = Athenaeus IV 161a).\nIn The Pythagorizing Woman, Alexis presents the vegetarian\nsacrificial feast that is customary for the Pythagoreans as including\ndried figs, cheese and olive cakes, and reports that the Pythagorean\nlife entailed \u201cscanty food, filth, cold, silence, sullenness,\nand no baths\u201d as well as drinking water instead of wine (Frs.\n201\u2013202 = Athenaeus IV 161c and III 122f).\n\nA number of these characteristics can be connected to the\nacusmata (Arnott 1996, 583), e.g., the lack of bathing may be\na joke based on the acusma that forbids the Pythagoreans from\nusing the public baths (Iamblichus, VP 83), Antiphanes (fr.\n158) satirizes the acusmata\u2019s bizarre list of foods\nthat can be eaten (D.L. 8.19) by describing his Pythagoreans as\nsearching for sea orach, and the silence or sullenness ascribed to the\nPythagoreans in comedy accords not just with the acusmata but\nwith early testimony about the Pythagoreans in Isocrates\n(Busiris 29) and Dicaearchus (Fr. 40 Mirhady). A fragment of\nAristophon\u2019s Pythagorist suggests that this ascetic\nlife was based on poverty rather than philosophical scruple and that,\nif you put meat and fish in front of these Pythagorists, they would\ngobble them down (Fr. 9 = Athenaeus IV 161e). In a fragment of Alexis,\nafter the speaker reports that the Pythagoreans eat nothing animate,\nhe is interrupted by someone who objects that \u201cEpicharides eats\ndogs, and he is a Pythagorean,\u201d to which the response is,\n\u201cyes, but he kills them first and so they are not still\nanimate\u201d (Fr. 223 + Athenaeus 161b). Epicharides and some other\nnamed figures may well be Athenians who are satirized by being\nassigned a Pythagorean life (Athenaeus 2006, 272). Another fragment of\nAristophon\u2019s Pythagorist reports that the Pythagoreans\nhave a far different existence in the underworld than others, in that\nthey feast with Hades because of their piety, but this just occasions\nthe remark that Hades is an unpleasant god to enjoy the company of\nsuch filthy wretches (Fr. 12 = Diogenes Laertius VIII 38).\n\nBoth Alexis (Fr. 223 = Athenaeus IV 161b) and Cratinus the younger\n(Fr. 7 = Diogenes Laertius VIII 37) wrote plays entitled The\nPeople of Tarentum, which, although they may not have been\nprimarily about Pythagoreans, featured depictions of them (Arnott\n1996, 625\u2013626). In this case, the Pythagoreans are again\nsatirized for their simple diet, bread and water (which is called\n\u201cprison fare\u201d), and for drinking no wine. In these plays,\nhowever, the Pythagoreans are also presented as feeding on\n\u201csubtle arguments\u201d and \u201cfinely honed thoughts\u201d\nand as pestering others with them, in a way that is reminiscent of\nAristophanes\u2019 treatment of Socrates in the Clouds.\n\nGiven the fragmentary nature of the evidence, it is unclear whether\nthese ascetic Pythagoreans who engage in argument are the same as the\nPythagorists in the other comedies, who are characterized by their\nfilth and eccentric appearance. Certainly the latter are more\nreminiscent of Diodorus of Aspendus, while the former might be closer\nto what we know of someone like Cleinias. In the first half of the\nthird century, the poet Theocritus still preserves a memory of these\nPythagorists as \u201cpale and without shoes\u201d (XIV 5). The\nscholiast to the passage testifies to the continuing controversy about\nthe Pythagorists by drawing a distinction between Pythagoreans who\ngive every attention to their body and Pythagorists who are filthy\n(although another scholion reports that others say the opposite, see\nArnott 1996, 581). A passage in Iamblichus (VP 80) similarly\nargues that the Pythagoreans were the true followers of Pythagoras,\nwhile the Pythagorists just emulated them.\n\nIn recent scholarship, the tendency has been to regard Diodorus and\nthe Pythagorists as legitimate Pythagoreans of the acusmatic stamp,\nwhose eccentricities are perhaps a little exaggerated in comedy. The\nextensive evidence from antiquity which argues that they were not true\nPythagoreans is interpreted as bias on the part of conservative\nPythagoreans of the hyper-math\u00eamatici sort, such as\nAristoxenus, who wanted to disassociate themselves and Pythagoreanism\nin general from such strange people. This is a possible interpretation\nof the evidence, but, as the evidence for Diodorus shows, it is also\nquite possible that Diodorus and the more extreme Pythagorists\ndepicted in comedy were in fact people with whom few Pythagoreans\neither of the math\u00eamatici or the acusmatici\nwanted to associate themselves. Many religious movements have a\nradical fringe, and there is little reason to think that\nPythagoreanism should differ in this regard. In connection with his\nthesis that the  acusmata were a literary phenomenon and that\nno one lived a life in accordance with them Zhmud argues that the\nPythagorists of comedy are a creation of the comic stage and do not\nprovide evidence for Pythagoreans living a life governed by\nacusmata (Zhmud 2012a, 175\u2013183). It is true that many\nof the features of the Pythagorists are shared with Socrates as\npresented in the Clouds (subtle arguments, plain food, filthy\nclothes). Zhmud suggests that vegetarianism was added to this stock\npicture of the philosopher to give a Pythagorean color and that this\nvegetarianism was derived solely from the eccentric figure of Diodorus\nof Aspendus. However, as noted above there are more connections to the\nacusmata than just vegetarianism and it is hard to believe\nthat the repeated jokes at the expense of those living a Pythagorean\nlife had no correlate in reality other than Diodorus. \n\nPerhaps the best way to evaluate the complicated evidence for\nfourth-century Pythagoreanism is to conclude that there were three\nmain groups, each of which admitted some variation. There were\nmath\u00eamatici such as Archytas who did serious research\nin the mathematical disciplines and natural philosophy but who also\nlived an ascetic life that emphasized self-control and avoidance of\nbodily pleasure. Other Pythagoreans such as Cleinias or Xenophilus may\nhave done no work in the sciences but lived a Pythagorean life, which\nwas similar to that of Archytas and followed principles similar to\nthose set out in Aristoxenus\u2019 Pythagorean Precepts.\nThey may have observed some mild dietary restrictions and may be\nsimilar to the figures satirized in The Men of Tarentum as\neating a simple diet but still engaged in subtle arguments. There was\nprobably a continuum of people in this category with some following\nmore or different sets of the acusmata than others. Finally\nthere are the Pythagorean hippies such as Diodorus and the\nPythagorists, who ostentatiously live a life in accord with some of\nthe acusmata, but who take such an extreme interpretation of\nthem as to be regarded as eccentrics by most Pythagoreans.\n\nDiogenes Laertius reports, evidently on the authority of Aristoxenus,\nthat the last Pythagoreans were Xenophilus from the Thracian\nChalcidice (Aristoxenus\u2019 teacher), and four Pythagoreans from\nPhlius: Phanton, Echecrates, Diocles and Polymnastus. These\nPythagoreans are further identified as the pupils of Philolaus and\nEurytus. Little more is known of Xenophilus beyond his living for more\nthan 105 years (DK I 442\u2013443). The Pythagoreans from Phlius are\njust names except Echecrates (DK I 443), to whom Phaedo narrates,\nevidently in Phlius, the events of Socrates\u2019 last day in\nPlato\u2019s Phaedo. Socrates\u2019 interlocutors in the\nPhaedo, Simmias and Cebes, are often regarded as\nPythagoreans, because they are said to have been pupils of Philolaus\nwhen he was in Thebes. They are also shown to be pupils of Socrates,\nhowever, and it is unclear that their connection to Philolaus was any\ncloser than their connection to Socrates. They are not listed in\nIamblichus\u2019 catalogue as Pythagoreans; Diogenes Laertius\nincludes them with other followers of Socrates (II 124\u2013125).\nEchecrates might have been born around 420 and thus be a young man at\nthe dramatic date of the Phaedo. Aristoxenus\u2019 assertion\nthat these were the last of the Pythagoreans would then suggest that\nPythagoreanism died out around 350, when Echecrates was an old\nman.\n\nRiedweg says that this claim is \u201cdemonstrably untrue\u201d\npointing to a Pythagorean, Lycon, who criticized Aristotle\u2019s\nsupposed extravagant way of life and to the Pythagorists discussed\nabove (2005, 106). This seems slender evidence upon which to be so\ncritical of Aristoxenus. Virtually nothing is known of Lycon, and\nAristocles (1st-2nd c. CE), who recounts the criticism of Aristotle,\nsays that Lycon \u201ccalled himself a Pythagorean,\u201d thus\nexpressing some sort of reservation about his credentials (DK I\n445\u2013446). Aristoxenus\u2019 assertion is probably to be\nunderstood as a general claim that, with the deaths of the\nPythagoreans from Phlius around the middle of the fourth century,\nPythagoreanism as an active movement was dead. This would be\ncompatible with a few individuals still claiming to be Pythagoreans\nafter 350.\n\nThis is not inconsistent with the existence of a few isolated\nindividuals, who still claim to be Pythagoreans. Certainly, from the\nevidence available to modern scholars, Aristoxenus\u2019 claim is\nlargely true. From about 350 BCE until about 100 BCE, there is a\nradical drop in evidence for individuals who call themselves\nPythagoreans. Iamblichus (In Nic. 116.1\u20137) appears to\ndate the Pythagoreans Myonides and Euphranor, who worked on the\nmathematics of means, after the time of Eratosthenes (285\u2013194\nBCE) and hence to the second century BCE or later (Burkert 1972a,\n442), but Iamblichus\u2019 history of the means is very confused and\nthey might belong to the rise of Neopythagoreanism in the first\ncenturies BCE and CE. Kahn (2001, 83) sees a hint of Pythagorean cult\nactivity in the spurious Pythagorean Memoirs, which must date\nsometime before the first half of the first century BCE, when they are\nquoted by Alexander Polyhistor (see section 4.2 below). A few other\nPythagorean pseudepigrapha appear in the period (see further below,\nsect. 4.2), although it is unclear what sort of Pythagorean community,\nif any, was associated with them. Pythagoreanism is not completely\ndead between 350 and 100 (see further below, sect. 3.5), but few\nindividual Pythagoreans or organized groups of Pythagoreans can be\nidentified in this period.\n",
