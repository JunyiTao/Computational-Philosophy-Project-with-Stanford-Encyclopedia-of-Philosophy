    "main_text": "\n\nComparative philosophy brings together philosophical traditions that\nhave developed in relative isolation from one another and that are\ndefined quite broadly along cultural and regional lines \u2013\nChinese versus Western, for example. Several main issues about the\ncommensurability of philosophical traditions make up the subject\nmatter of comparative philosophy. One issue is methodological\ncommensurability \u2013 whether and how comparisons between different\nphilosophical traditions, in this case the Chinese and Western, are to\nbe conducted. Views run the gamut from those holding that meaningful\ncomparisons cannot be conducted at all to those holding that the\ncontent of traditions must largely be the same. Other issues\nconcerning commensurability concern specific subject matters of\ntraditions. The issue of metaphysical and epistemological\ncommensurability involves the comparison of traditions on their\nconceptions of the real and their modes of inquiry and justification.\nEthical commensurability involves the comparison of these traditions\non the matters of how people ought to live their lives, whether both\ntraditions have moralities and if so how similar and dissimilar they\nare. The separation between these main issues is somewhat artificial,\ngiven that a discussion of methodological commensurability will\ninevitably involve the comparison of traditions on metaphysical,\nepistemological, and ethical matters. There is some heuristic value,\nhowever, in beginning with a general discussion of views on\nmethodological commensurability with a brief illustration of how these\nviews might be applied to some Chinese/Western comparisons. Subsequent\nsections will address Chinese-Western comparisons in metaphysics,\nepistemology, and ethics that have assumed special prominence in the\nliterature. \n\nDoing comparative philosophy well can be very difficult because of the\nvast range of texts and their intellectual and historical contexts it\nrequires its practitioners to cover. Oversimplifications, excessively\nstark contrasts, and illicit assimilations count as the most frequent\nsins. One benefit of comparative philosophy lies in the way that it\nforces reflection on the most deeply entrenched and otherwise\nunquestioned agendas and assumptions of one\u2019s own tradition.\nAnother benefit at which its practitioners often aim is that the\ntraditions actually interact and enrich one another. Demands for rigor\nand depth of scholarship obviously rank as some of the most important\nstandards applying to philosophy inquiry. The task of meeting these\nstandards becomes more manageable as the field of inquiry narrows.\nSuch a result can be legitimate but sometimes myopic and\nimpoverishing. To the extent that different traditions address common\nor overlapping problems, we might expect better philosophical work\nfrom those who can draw from a greater range of traditions. Drawing\nfrom studies in experimental psychology and the theory of culture as\nproviding individuals with toolkits for problem-solving, Bruya (2015)\nargues that a multicultural approach in philosophy and in education\ngenerally contributes more creativity and effectiveness in\nproblem-solving.\n",
