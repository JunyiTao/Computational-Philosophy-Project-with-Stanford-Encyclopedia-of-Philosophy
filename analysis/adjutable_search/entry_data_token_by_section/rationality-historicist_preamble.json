    "main_text": "\n\nMany scientists, philosophers, and laypersons have regarded science as\nthe one human enterprise that successfully escapes the contingencies\nof history to establish eternal truths about the universe, via a\nspecial, rational method of inquiry. Historicists oppose this view. In\nthe 1960s several historically informed philosophers of science\nchallenged the then-dominant accounts of scientific method advanced by\nthe Popperians and the positivists (the logical positivists and\nlogical empiricists) for failing to fit historical scientific practice\nand failing particularly to account for deep scientific change. While\nseveral strands of historicism originated in nineteenth-century\nhistoriography, this article focuses, first, on the historicist\nconceptions of scientific rationality that became prominent in the\n1960s and 1970s, as the maturation of the field of historiography of\nscience began to suggest competing models of scientific development,\nand, second, on recent approaches such as historical epistemology.\n\nThe \u201cBattle of the Big Systems\u201d of the 1960s and\n\u201870s, involving historicists such as Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos,\nPaul Feyerabend, and Larry Laudan, eventually gave way to a realist\nreaction, as many philosophers rejected the perceived skepticism and\npotential relativism of the historicist movement, now reinforced by\nnew-wave sociology of science. The 1990s featured the so-called\nScience Wars, as philosophers attempted to defend truth, rationality,\nobjectivity, and scientific progress (and their own turf) from the\nperceived threats of rapidly developing, sociology-inspired science\nand technology studies and (other) postmodern influences. Since then,\na group of interdisciplinary scholars have attempted to reimagine ways\nin which historical and philosophical work can be brought together\nfruitfully.\n",
