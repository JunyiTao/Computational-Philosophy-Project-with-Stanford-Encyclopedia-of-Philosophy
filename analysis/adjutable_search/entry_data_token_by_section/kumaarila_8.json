    "main_text": "Metaphysics and philosophy of language || On the reality of linguistic universals\n3.2 On the reality of linguistic universals\n\n\nIt is important to note, with respect to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncharacteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka intuitions about language,\nthat the word \u015babda\u2014which often means\n\u201cword,\u201d as in the fifth of Jaimini\u2019s\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btras, where it is\nrelations between \u015babda and referents (artha)\nthat are said to be primordial\u2014is essentially ambiguous between\nwhat Saussure distinguished as langue and parole.\nThus, the same word can also refer generally to\n\u201csound,\u201d in the sense denoting any object of the\nauditory sense faculty. To that extent, \u015babda can be\nunderstood as referring either to language as such\n(Saussure\u2019s langue), or to particular, temporally describable\noccasions of linguistic utterance (Saussure\u2019s\nparole). It thus becomes clear that arguments for thinking that\n\u015babda is eternal will seem rather different depending on\nwhich of these senses one takes to be in play. Buddhists, especially\ninsofar as they are typically apt to focus on particular occasions of\nuse, find it obviously true that (as on one favored Buddhist example of\na formally stated inference) \u201c\u015babda is impermanent,\nbecause it is produced,\u201d just like artifacts like jars (which we\nknow to be both produced on particular occasions, and essentially\nimpermanent). The Buddhist claim is less obviously compelling, however, if instead\none takes it that \u015babda denotes always already available\nconditions of the possibility of any particular utterance\u2019s\ncounting as linguistic.\n\n\nStill, while it is surely appropriate thus to credit\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments for the eternality of language with\ncapturing profound insights regarding our linguistic being, the case\nfor his account of the eternality of language is greatly complicated by\nthe fact that Kum\u0101rila actually holds, in a way, that it is in\nboth of the foregoing senses of the word that\n\u015babda should be understood as eternal; on his view, that\nis, it is not only linguistic universals that are timeless, but also\nthe phonemes that manifest these. This view reflects, no\ndoubt, characteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commitments,\ncentering on the category of mantra, about the\nVedas\u2014commitments, in particular, about the inherent power not\nonly of language as such, but of properly uttered Sanskrit sentences\nto\nbring into being the states of affairs they concern. Many\nBrahmanical texts preserve, in this regard, a famous story of the\nsignificance of precise transmission of the text:\u00a0 wishing, by\nuttering the nominal compound Indra*ndash;\u015batru (which could\nmean \u201cconqueror of Indra\u201d), to make his son triumphant, the\nmythical figure of Tva\u1e63\u1e6dar instead ensured his son\u2019s\ndeath by pronouncing the compound so that it had the sense of an\nadjectival, bahuvr\u012bhi compound (\u201chaving Indra as\nconqueror\u201d)\u2014with the latter state of affairs then brought\ninto being by his utterance.\n\n\nIt is perhaps insofar as he was attuned to such a view of the\nsignificance of Vedic language that Kum\u0101rila was apt to eschew\ntypically holistic understandings of meaning, and instead to hold the\nkind of atomistic view on which individual phonemes can be thought part\nof what is eternal about language. Kum\u0101rila was, in this regard,\ncritical of the Sanskrit grammarians\u2019 spho\u1e6da\n(\u201cbursting forth\u201d) theory of meaning, which had been\nelaborated precisely to account for the expression of meaning in light\nof the manifestly temporal character of linguistic utterance.\nThe considerations here in play are not unlike those that preoccupied\nHusserl in his On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of\nInternal Time (1991); just, then, as Husserl was led to venture\nthat the seemingly instantaneous present of consciousness must somehow\ncomprise something of the past and future if we are to account for\nthings like the musical experience of melody, so, too, Sanskritic\nthinkers had wondered how to account for the dawning of\nmeaning relative to the necessarily temporal unfolding of any\nsentence one could encounter. At the moment, for example, when the last\nphoneme of a sentence is uttered, the initial phonemes are no longer\npresent; at what point, then, are we to say that the sentence\u2019s\nmeaning is experienced, and how are we to account for that\nwith regard to the necessarily vanished moments that are involved?\n\n\nWhile proponents of the spho\u1e6da (or \u201cbursting\nforth\u201d) theory had urged that we must, in this regard, posit the\nsudden dawning of something akin to a unitary proposition\n(which might, indeed, be taken as the sense of the word\nspho\u1e6da in this context), Kum\u0101rila instead argued\nthat understanding\u2014whether of sentences, or just of\nindividual words\u2014can be explained with reference to\nmemory of discrete phonemes, and that reference to anything over and\nabove the phonemes was therefore unnecessary. Similarly, Kum\u0101rila\neschewed the holistic account of sentence-meaning\u2014called\nanvit\u0101bhidh\u0101nav\u0101da, the doctrine that a\nsentence is \u201cthe expressed meaning of a series [of words]\u201d\n(per Brough, 1953, 416)\u2014advanced by Prabh\u0101kara, who\nwould argue that complete sentences represent the basic unit of\nmeaning. Instead, Kum\u0101rila held the so-called\nabhihit\u0101nvayav\u0101da doctrine\u2014the view that a\nsentence is \u201ca series of expressed word-meanings\u201d (Brough,\n416)\u2014on which sentence-meaning is essentially analyzable in\nterms of word-meanings that are independently intelligible. Against,\nthen, the kind of holistic view on which the sense of a word is to be\nknown chiefly from substitution in sentences, Kum\u0101rila argued\n(just as he had against the spho\u1e6da theory) that\n\u201cas the words are uttered in a sentence, each word performs its\ntask of expressing its meaning, and the sentence is the summation of\nthese meanings.\u201d (Brough, 415; see, as well, Kunjunni Raja\n1963, Matilal 1990, Siderits 1991.)\n\n\nWhile such atomistic views might not be judged very promising, and\nwhile they are not obviously required by (and may even seem in tension\nwith) such intuitions as that language essentially transcends\nindividual occasions of use, they fit well with Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nadditional commitment to thinking that the phonemes of Vedic Sanskrit\nare part of what is eternal in language\u2014though it is surely\ndifficult to imagine how something as eminently temporal as\nsound could thus be reckoned as in any sense\ntimeless. Notwithstanding his counter-intuitive commitment to\neternally existent phonemes, Kum\u0101rila was also an uncompromising\nrealist about more clearly abstract universals, taking it, for example,\nthat the referents of kind-terms are real properties such as being\na cow. (See Scharf 1996.) This comes through not only in\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s philosophy of language, but also in his\nepistemology; against, then, Buddhists who argued (with Dign\u0101ga\nand Dharmak\u012brti) that perception is essentially non-conceptual,\nKum\u0101rila firmly held that perceptions, properly speaking,\nimmediately yield justified beliefs regarding things as the\nkinds of things they are; that perception thus discloses things\nunder some description shows, among other things, that the\nkinds of conceptual items that figure in descriptions are real.\n\n\nOne can really see, that is, not only particular bovine\ncritters, but also the fact of their exemplifying go-tva, the\nproperty of \u201cbeing a cow\u201d; this is just what it means to\nperceive any such particular as a cow. This is among\nthe points regarding which Kum\u0101rila found it apt to deploy the\nepistemological doctrine of immediate justification; thus, among the\nreasons why it cannot reasonably be denied that properties like\nbeing a cow are real is that there is nothing that finally\nfalsifies the many justified beliefs we have concerning things that are\nperceived as exemplifying just such properties. Insofar, that is, as we\nare prima facie justified in thinking of something perceived as\nbeing a cow really to be cow, and insofar as no overriding\ncognition is forthcoming, we are entitled to think the perceived fact\nof its being a cow is real. (See, on these lines of thought,\nTaber\u2019s 2005 translation of the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika\u2019s chapter on perception.)\n\n\nWith respect to the question of how timeless properties like being\na cow relate to the individuals that \u201cmanifest\u201d them\n(tokens are in this context referred to as vyakti,\n\u201cmanifestations\u201d of types), Kum\u0101rila aimed to finesse\nthe issue that bedeviled Brahmanical proponents of the Ny\u0101ya\nschool. Thus, Naiy\u0101yikas characteristically invoked the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika category of \u201cinherence\u201d\n(samav\u0101ya), holding that an \u201cinherence\u201d\nrelation obtained between universals and the particulars that\ninstantiate them. Criticizing the Ny\u0101ya account on the grounds\nthat thus positing an intermediary category to do the work of\nrelating the two different kinds of things just opens up an\ninfinite regress, Kum\u0101rila instead held a view with affinities to\nthe kind of perspectivalism that is generally characteristic of Jaina\nphilosophy; on this view, \u201cuniversal\u201d and\n\u201cparticular\u201d represent different aspects of the same\nthings, with neither aspect being finally intelligible apart from the\nother.
