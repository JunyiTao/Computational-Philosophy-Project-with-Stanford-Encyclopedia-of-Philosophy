    "main_text": "Matter and form introduced\n1. Matter and form introduced\n\nAristotle introduces his notions of matter and form in the first book\nof his Physics, his work on natural science. Natural science\nis concerned with things that change, and Aristotle divides changes\ninto two main types: there are accidental changes, which involve\nconcrete particulars, or \u201csubstances\u201d (ousiai) in\nAristotle\u2019s terminology, gaining or losing a property (see\nCategories 1\u20135, Physics i 7). For instance,\nthe changes whereby Socrates falls in a vat of dye and turns blue, or\nputs on a few pounds from excessive feasting during the Panathenaia,\ncount as accidental changes (in the categories of quality and\nquantity, respectively). Socrates, a substance, gains the property of\nbeing blue, or the property of weighing twelve stone. The other main\nkind of change is substantial change, whereby a substance comes into,\nor passes out of, existence. For example, when Socrates dies, or is\nborn (or perhaps conceived, or somewhere in between conception and\nbirth), a substantial change has taken place.\n\nMatter and form are required to account for this second kind of\nchange, if it is to conform to Aristotle\u2019s general conceptual\nanalysis of change. In any change, he contends, there must be three\nthings: (1) something which underlies and persists through the change;\n(2) a \u201clack\u201d, which is one of a pair of opposites, the\nother of which is (3) a form acquired during the course of the change\n(Physics i 7, 190a13\u2013191a22). Thus, for example, in an\naccidental change, the underlying thing is the substance which\nacquires a new accidental property. For instance, when Socrates learns\nto play the flute, he transitions from a state of being unmusical (the\nlack) to a state of musicality (the form). But for us to be able to\nsay that there is something which has changed, there must be something\nwhich remains the same throughout the change, and in this case the\nobvious candidate is Socrates, who is one and the same person\nthroughout his musical training.\n\nIn accidental changes there is always a substance to underlie the\nchange, but this is not true for substantial changes, since these\ninvolve the coming to be or passing away of a substance (see the\namusing remark of Irving Copi, quoted at the start of the entry on\n identity over time). \n In these cases, the thing that underlies is the matter of the\nsubstance. When someone builds a house, it is the bricks which persist\nthrough the change. They transition from a state of not being a house\nto acquire the property of being a house. Aristotle often uses the\nexample of artefacts like houses, even though he does not regard them\nas substances properly-speaking (Metaphysics vii 17,\n1041b28\u201330), because their matter is more straightforward to\nidentify. Nevertheless, the same analysis holds in the case of\norganisms, which are the substances proper: when an organism is\ncreated or destroyed, when an acorn becomes an oak tree, or a human\ndies, there must be some matter which persists through the change. To\nsay otherwise would be to say that things can come to be out of, or\nvanish into, nothing, and Aristotle understandably agrees with his\npredecessor Parmenides that this is impossible (Physics i 8,\n191a23\u2013b17). Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics takes as its starting\npoints observed phenomena, and seeks to preserve common sense beliefs\nwhere possible. We never experience anything simply appearing or\ndisappearing at random.\n\nThe word \u201cform\u201d may misleadingly suggest that what is\nacquired in a case of substantial generation is simply a shape, and\nthis impression is reinforced by some of the examples that Aristotle\nuses, especially when focusing on artefacts: plausibly the form of a\nbronze statue just is its shape. When we consider organisms, however,\nit becomes apparent that having the right shape is not sufficient to\npossess the form. A thing\u2019s form is its definition or\nessence\u2014what it is to be a human being, for example. A statue\nmay be human-shaped, but it is not a human, because it cannot perform\nthe functions characteristic of humans: thinking, perceiving, moving,\ndesiring, eating and growing, etc. The connection between a\nthing\u2019s form and its function emerges in Physics ii 3,\nwhere Aristotle distinguishes his four kinds of cause: material,\nformal, efficient, and final, and suggests a special connection\nbetween the formal and final cause.\n\nHere one needs to proceed cautiously, however, since it is sometimes\nsaid that Aristotle\u2019s word \u201ccause\u201d (aitia)\nwould be better translated as \u201cexplanation\u201d (or\n\u201cexplanatory factor\u201d, to avoid the implication that they\nare linguistic items, as opposed to things-in-the-world). Certainly\nmodern philosophers tend to use \u201ccause\u201d in a narrower way,\nwhich approximates to Aristotle\u2019s efficient cause.\nAristotle\u2019s idea is that there are four kinds of thing that need\nto be mentioned in order to give a full account of the nature of an\nobject, each corresponding to a particular kind of question. We need\nto know what the thing is made of, and the answer to this question is\nthe thing\u2019s matter\u2014bricks, in the case of a house; bodily\norgans in the case of a human being. Next we need to know what the\nthing is, or how it is defined, and the answer to this is the\nthing\u2019s form or essence. We also need to know what made the\nthing come into existence, who or what created it, and this is the\nthing\u2019s efficient or \u201cmoving\u201d cause. Lastly, we need\nto know what the thing is for, what its purpose or function\nis\u2014the final cause. Now Aristotle observes that, although these\nare all distinct questions, in the case of the last three very often\nthe same thing will serve as the answer to all of them\n(Physics ii 7, 198a24\u201327). A house is defined as a\nshelter of a certain sort (De Anima i 1, 403b3\u20137;\nMetaphysics viii 3, 1043a29\u201336). That is what a house\nis, i.e., its formal cause, but it is also what a house is\nfor, its final cause, since houses, like all artefacts are\nfunctionally defined. Similarly, a human being is defined as something\nwhich lives a certain kind of rationally-directed life. But, on\nAristotle\u2019s view, this is also what a human being is for. The\nhuman function is to live such a life (Nicomachean Ethics i\n7, 1097b22\u20131098a20; cf. De Anima ii 1, 412a6\u201322).\nAs for the efficient cause, it is qualitatively, although not\nnumerically, identical with the formal cause, at least in the organism\ncase, since human beings give birth to human beings, and the same goes\nfor all other living things. Thus, even though Aristotle admits four\ndifferent kinds of cause, in a sense it is only really matter and form\nthat play any ineliminable explanatory role in his system.\n\nIn fact, Aristotle does not simply focus on the case of artefacts\nbecause their pre-existing matter is easier to identify.\nThere is a particular issue here with the case of organisms, which\narises out of Aristotle\u2019s insistence that a human being, for\ninstance, is composed of a rational soul, which is the form, and an\norganic body, which is the matter (for further discussion of this\nproblem, see Ackrill 1972/73). It is characteristic of the matter of\nartefacts that numerically the same stuff which makes up one object\ncan later be used as the matter of another: for instance, when one\nmelts down a bronze statue, and then molds it into some jewelry, it is\nthe same bit of bronze throughout. It is crucial that a thing\u2019s\nmatter can survive such changes, if it is to play the role that\nAristotle needs it to play in cases of substantial generation and\ndestruction, as being the thing that underlies such changes. If an\nartefact\u2019s matter only contingently has the form it has, the\nsame does not obviously seem true of organisms. Unlike in the case of\na house built from bricks, it does not seem as though one\u2019s body\npredates one\u2019s existence, and so can serve as the underlying\nthing in a case of substantial generation. One might think that at\nleast the body does exist after death, but in fact Aristotle would\ndisagree. Instead, he insists that a dead body is only\n\u201chomonymously\u201d called a body\u2014that it is only\ndescribed as \u201ca body\u201d by extension, because it\nsuperficially resembles a living body (De Anima ii 1,\n412b10\u201325; Metaphysics vii 10, 1035b9\u201325). It is\nnot a real body, because it is incapable of performing the functions\nnormally associated with bodies, just as a statue\u2019s eye, or an\neye in a painting, is not a real eye, because it is made of stone or\npaint, and thus cannot serve the function that genuine eyes exist\nfor\u2014seeing (for further discussion, see the supplement to the\nentry on Aristotle\u2019s psychology on\n a fundamental problem about hylomorphism).\n\nIt might seem that Aristotle is rather going against ordinary\nlinguistic usage here, since we in fact regularly do refer to dead\nbodies as \u201cbodies\u201d. Whether a dead body is really a body\nmight seem like a trivial linguistic issue, which can simply be\ndecided by fiat. The obvious way to resolve the problem might seem to\nbe simply to drop the insistence that the body cannot exist without\nbeing coupled to a living human soul. Allowing that a dead body\nremains the same body as its living counterpart will not help the\ndifficulty of what to say about the matter that predates the coming to\nbe of the organism, when there is no apparent body, living or dead.\nWhat is more, Aristotle is deeply committed to his position that the\nhuman body is essentially ensouled, because of his view that things\nare defined by their functions (Meteorologica iv 12,\n390a10\u201315; Generation of Animals ii 1,734b24\u201331).\nIt seems as though he believes that a human being\u2019s matter must\nbe contingently alive, so that it can serve as the underlying thing\nthat remains when the human being comes into existence, but also that\nit must be essentially alive, because it is functionally defined. If\nso, he contradicts himself.\n\nThe best way to resolve this apparent contradiction in\nAristotle\u2019s hylomorphism is to point out that an organism can\nhave more than one level of matter. Aristotle believes that all\nsensible substances can be analyzed into matter and form, but such an\nanalysis is not restricted to the things he calls substances. Matter\ncan itself be divided into matter and form: for instance, bricks are\nmade of clay, shaped into cuboid blocks. Again, clay has its own\nmatter\u2014mud, say\u2014and so on. Eventually, if one pursues this\nhierarchy of matter far enough downwards, Aristotle believes that one\nwill reach the four elements, earth, air, fire and water. He agrees\nwith Empedocles that everything in the sub-lunar world is ultimately\nmade up of different ratios of these four elements. Matter then should\nreally be understood as a relative notion\u2014it is always the\nmatter of something. Aristotle distinguishes between a\nthing\u2019s proximate matter, the stuff it is most immediately made\nof, and its less proximate matter, i.e., the matter of its matter, or\neven further down the hierarchy, culminating in its ultimate matter,\nthe elements. The organic body which is a human being\u2019s\nproximate matter is essentially alive, but this need not apply to all\nof the other matter further down the chain. Aristotle distinguishes\nbetween homoiomerous and heteromerous parts (Parts of Animals\ni 1, 640b25\u201330). Homoiomerous parts are stuffs, like bronze or\nflesh, which Aristotle believes have no internal structure. Every part\nof a homoiomerous stuff is the same as every other part, containing\nthe same ratio of elements. This view of homoiomerous parts is\nconsistent with Aristotle\u2019s denial of atomism; he believes that\nmatter, as well as space and time, are infinitely divisible. The\nbodily organs, hands, feet, eyes, hearts, etc., are heteromerous,\nsince they do have internal structure, with different parts of them\nmade up of different stuffs. A person\u2019s hand, for instance, is\nmade of flesh, bones, blood and other such biological matter, which in\nturn are made of earth, air, fire and water. It may be that flesh too\nis functionally defined, so that dead flesh is only called\n\u201cflesh\u201d homonymously as well. Even if nothing biological\ncan exist when not alive, it seems clear that the elements at least\nmust be able to do so. Therefore there will be some, low-level matter\nto serve as the thing that underlies the coming to be and passing away\nof organisms, even though an organism\u2019s proximate matter exists\nfor precisely as long as it does.\n",
