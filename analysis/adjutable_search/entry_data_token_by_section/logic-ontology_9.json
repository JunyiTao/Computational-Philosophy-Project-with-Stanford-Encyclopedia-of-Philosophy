(L1) meets (O2) and (O3)\n\nFormal ontologies are theories that attempt to give precise\nmathematical formulations of the properties and relations of certain\nentities. Such theories usually propose axioms about these entities in\nquestion, spelled out in some formal language based on some system of\nformal logic. Formal ontology can been seen as coming in three kinds,\ndepending on their philosophical ambition. Let\u2019s call them\nrepresentational, descriptive, and systematic. We will in this section\nbriefly discuss what philosophers, and others, have hoped to do with\nsuch formal ontologies.\n\nA formal ontology is a mathematical theory of certain entities,\nformulated in a formal, artificial language, which in turn is based on\nsome logical system like first order logic, or some form of the lambda\ncalculus, or the like. Such a formal ontology will specify axioms\nabout what entities of this kind there are, what their relations among\neach other are, and so on. Formal ontologies could also only have\naxioms that state how the things the theory is about, whatever they\nmay be, relate to each other, but no axioms that state that certain\nthings exist. For example, a formal ontology of events won\u2019t say\nwhich events there are. That is an empirical question. But it might\nsay under what operations events are closed under, and what structure\nall the events there are exhibit. Similarly for formal ontologies of\nthe part-whole relation, and others. See Simons 1987 for a well\nknown book on various formal versions of mereology, the study of parts\nand wholes.\n\nFormal ontologies can be useful in a variety of different ways. One\ncontemporary use is as a framework to represent information in an\nespecially useful way. Information represented in a particular formal\nontology can be more easily accessible to automated information\nprocessing, and how best to do this is an active area of research in\ncomputer science. The use of the formal ontology here is\nrepresentational. It is a framework to represent information, and as\nsuch it can be representationally successful whether or not the formal\ntheory used in fact truly describes a domain of entities. So, a formal\nontology of states of affairs, lets say, can be most useful to\nrepresent information that might otherwise be represented in plain\nEnglish, and this can be so whether or not there indeed are any states\nof affairs in the world. Such uses of formal ontologies are thus\nrepresentational.\n\nA different philosophical use of a formal ontology is one that aims to\nbe descriptive. A descriptive formal ontology aims to correctly\ndescribe a certain domain of entities, say sets, or numbers, as\nopposed to all things there are. Take common conceptions of set theory\nas one example. Many people take set theory to aim at correctly\ndescribing a domain of entities, the pure sets. This is, of course, a\ncontroversial claim in the philosophy of set theory, but if it is\ncorrect then set theory could be seen as a descriptive formal ontology\nof pure sets. It would imply that among incompatible formal theories\nof sets only one could be correct. If set theory were merely\nrepresentational then both of the incompatible theories could be\nequally useful as representational tools, though probably for\ndifferent representational tasks.\n\nFinally, formal ontologies have been proposed as systematic theories\nof what there is, with some restrictions. Such systematic theories\nhope to give one formal theory for all there is, or at least a good\npart of it. Hardly anyone would claim that there can be a simple\nformal theory that correctly states what concrete physical objects\nthere are. There does not seem to be a simple principle that\ndetermines whether there are an even or odd number of mice at a\nparticular time. But maybe this apparent randomness only holds for\nconcrete physical objects. It might not hold for abstract objects,\nwhich according to many exist not contingently, but necessarily if at\nall. Maybe a systematic, simple formal theory is possible of all\nabstract objects. Such a systematic formal ontology will most commonly\nhave one kind of entities which are the primary subject of the theory,\nand a variety of different notions of reduction that specify how other\n(abstract) objects really are entities of this special kind. A simple\nview of this kind would be one according to which all abstract objects\nare sets, and numbers, properties, etc. are really special kinds of\nsets. However, more sophisticated versions of systematic formal\nontologies have been developed. An ambitious systematic formal\nontology can be found in Zalta 1983 and Zalta 1999 [2022] (see the\nOther Internet Resources).\n\nRepresentational formal ontologies, somewhat paradoxically, are\nindependent of any strictly ontological issues. Their success or\nfailure is independent of what there is. Descriptive formal ontologies\nare just like representational ones, except with the ambition of\ndescribing a domain of entities. Systematic formal ontologies go\nfurther in not only describing one domain, but in relating all\nentities (of a certain kind) to each other, often with particular\nnotions of reduction. These theories seem to be the most ambitious.\nTheir motivation comes from an attempt to find a simple and systematic\ntheory of all, say, abstract entities, and they can rely on the\nparadigm of aiming for simplicity in the physical sciences as a guide.\nThey, just like descriptive theories, will have to have as their\nstarting point a reasonable degree of certainty that we indeed are\nontologically committed to the entities they aim to capture. Without\nthat these enterprises seem to have little attraction. But even if the\nlatter philosophical ambitions fail, a formal ontology can still be a\nmost useful representational tool.\n",
