    "main_text": "Motivations for Non-cognitivism || Supervenience\n3.4 Supervenience\n\nIt is relatively common ground among moral theorists that moral\nproperties supervene on non-moral properties. Two items cannot differ\nin their moral properties without differing in some non-moral property\nas well. Or to put the point in terms more suited to the\nnon-cognitivist, virtually all agree that it is inappropriate to treat\ntwo items as morally distinguishable without believing that they are\nalso distinguishable in some other way. If two actions are otherwise\nindistinguishable, labeling one as good thereby commits one to\nlabeling the other as good. Often this thesis is put as the claim that\nmoral properties supervene on natural properties, and this has the\nadvantage of leaving open the possibility of the moral properties\nturning out to be among the natural properties.\n\nSome non-cognitivists have argued that this seemingly uncontroversial\ndatum supports their theories against rival alternatives. Hare seems\nto have introduced the term \u2018supervenience\u2019 to the\nphilosophical literature (Hare 1952, 145) and he suggested that his\nown theory, universal prescriptivism, was uniquely placed to explain\nit. Insofar as moral prescriptions were by their nature universal they\nwould prescribe or proscribe any action which was sufficiently similar\nto the action up for evaluation. Thus Hare included supervenience as\none of the phenomena that any adequate metaethical theory should\nexplain and he counted it as a point in favor of his theory that it\ndid so. But the feature of his theory that did the explanatory work\nwas not its non-cognitivism \u2013 rather it was that it required the\njudgments to be universal in the ways he specified. In fact, Hare\nhimself suggested that the supervenience of moral judgments on\ndescriptive features was part and parcel of these judgments having a\nsecondary descriptive meaning (Hare 1963, 7\u201322).\n\nOther contemporary expressivist theories can use a similar approach to\nexplaining supervenience. Take a version of expressivism which says\nthat a moral judgment that such and such an action is wrong predicates\na nonmoral property of that action and at the same time expresses\ndisapproval of that property. This too will explain supervenience,\ninsofar as the speaker will be committed by that moral judgment to\ndisapproving of anything else with that property. Gibbard\u2019s\n(1990) world-norm pair apparatus in which the judgments express\nattitudes towards norms that pick out actions by their natural\nfeatures will generate the same sort of result. (His 2003 update\ninherits this feature as will be explained below.) Thus each of these\ntheorists is able to explain supervenience. Many cognitivist theories\ncan also explain supervenience. Reductive naturalists get the\nsupervenience of the moral on the natural for free. If moral\nproperties just are natural properties, there should be no surprise if\ntwo items cannot differ in their moral properties without also\ndiffering in their natural properties (Dreier 1993). And while\nnonreductive naturalists and even nonnaturalists may have to offer\nexplanations, it isn\u2019t obvious that these explanations must\nfail. (McPherson ; van Roojen 2023) We might thus conclude that\nsupervenience does not favor either cognitivism or\nnon-cognitivism.\n\nSimon Blackburn, however, argues that the phenomenon of supervenience\nespecially favors non-cognitivism. According to Blackburn, it is not\njust the simple fact that moral properties supervene on nonmoral\nproperties that needs to be explained. Nor is it just that appropriate\nmoral predication must supervene on nonmoral predication, to put the\npoint in a way that does not beg the question against non-cognitivism.\nIt is rather to explain how honoring the supervenience constraint can\nbe a requirement of linguistic competence, even while there is no\nanalytic entailment from nonmoral claims to moral claims. In other\nwords, what needs explaining is how supervenience can be a conceptual\nrequirement even while there is no analytic equivalence between moral\nproperties and any non-moral property. Blackburn thinks that we\nrequire such an explanation even if there are metaphysically or\nnomically necessary connections between moral and nonmoral terms or\nproperties. For, he thinks, it is hard to see how such nomic or\nmetaphysical connections could justify the analytic status of the\nsupervenience thesis. People can be ignorant of nomic necessities for\nit is an empirical matter what natural laws govern our world. And they\nmight be ignorant of certain metaphysical necessities while knowing\nall the truths about the meanings of their terms. So these necessities\ncannot justify the apriori and analytic status that the supervenience\nrequirement has. Or to put the same point differently, a requirement\nto recognize some constraint that one should recognize merely in\nvirtue of having competence with the appropriate terms cannot be\nexplained by citing a fact which mere linguistic competence does not\nput one in a position to recognize.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s favored explanation of the difference in status\nbetween the two claims is roughly as follows: Moral judgments must\nsupervene on judgments regarding natural properties because it is the\npoint of moral judgments \u201cto guide desires and choices among the\nnatural features of the world\u201d (Blackburn 1993, 137). Since this\nsort of explanation makes reference to our purposes in using moral\nterms rather than to an independent realm of moral fact, Blackburn\nthinks it supports a quasi-realist account rather than a\nstraightforward realist theory. He goes on to suggest that because the\nexplanation relies on facts about what beliefs can coexist with\nlinguistic competence, there is \u201cno further inference to a\nmetaphysical conclusion\u201d (Blackburn 1993, 143).\n\nIt should be obvious that Blackburn\u2019s argument is not entirely\nindependent of the arguments for non-cognitivism that we have already\nsurveyed. The claim that there is no analytic entailment from any\nnatural property to any moral property is simply Hume\u2019s Law\n\u2013 a datum often supported through use of the open question\nargument. Thus any reductive naturalist about moral properties will\ndeny that premise of the argument along with the validity of the open\nquestion argument. (Dreier 1993) The thought that an explanation which\ninvolves the practical purposes to which moral judgments are put must\nfavor non-cognitivism over cognitivism might well depend on accepting\na Humean division between inert beliefs and motivating desires.\nAnti-Humeans just think that action-guiding purposes can be served by\nbeliefs concerning genuine properties (McDowell 1981; Bromwich 2010;\nSwartzer 2013, 2018; van Roojen 1995). And cognitivists who agree that\nthe analytic status of supervenience needs explanation will not need\nto deny that such explanations require claims about what the competent\ncan believe; on many understandings of analyticity, analytic claims\njust are claims the linguistically competent must accept (Dreier\n1993).\n\nAllan Gibbard (2003) has recently proposed a new argument for the\nsupervenience of normative judgements grounded in his fact-prac world\napparatus as a representational device for capturing normative\njudgments. Given that account of the content of normative judgments it\nwill turn out to be necessary that those with moral attitudes are\ncommitted to normative judgments which treat descriptively identical\nitems the same for purposes of planning. This is because the plans\nthemselves must be formulated so as to individuate circumstances of\naction using \u201crecognitional\u201d concepts. Thus any two\nrecognitionally identical circumstances will yield the same plan of\naction. If Gibbard\u2019s reasons for thinking that plans must be\nformulated in recognitional terms are cogent, this result would allow\nthe theory to explain the relevant phenomenon of supervenience. It\ndoes not, however, show that a cognitivist theory might not do just as\nwell on its own terms.\n",
