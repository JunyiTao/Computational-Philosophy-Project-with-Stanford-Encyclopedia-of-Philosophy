    "main_text": "Eschatology\n5. Eschatology\n\nFor Mulla Sadra, the eschaton is merely a new mode or renewal of\nexistence in a different level of manifestation and as such remains\nvery much within the remit of metaphysics. The very discussion of\neschatology within philosophy is significant. In the famous attack by\nal-Ghazali (d. 1111) in his Incoherence of the Philosophers,\nthinkers such as Avicenna were condemned for heresy for their failure\nto demonstrate the supposed Qur\u2019anic account of physical\nresurrection and the reality of the afterlife. One of the features of\nMulla Sadra\u2019s philosophy is to extend the remit of philosophy to\ncover issues on which the likes of Avicenna felt one needed to be\nsilent. Therefore, Mulla Sadra set himself the tasks of proving\nphysical resurrection, spending much time discussing what was meant by\nthe resurrection body (and indeed the body of the afterlife), the\nrefutation of metempsychosis and affirming the reality of the\nafterlife. His notion of existence as a constantly dynamic process of\nbecoming and unfolding that remains a singular reality and process\nallows him to incorporate this world of generation and corruption and\nannex it to the higher plane of resurrection and finally the existence\nof the afterlife.\n",
