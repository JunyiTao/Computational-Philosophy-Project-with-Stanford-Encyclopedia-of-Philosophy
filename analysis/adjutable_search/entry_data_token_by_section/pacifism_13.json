    "main_text": "Consequentialist Pacifism || Active Nonviolence\n3.1 Active Nonviolence\n\nRelated to these consequentialist arguments against war is a more\npositive consequentialist argument about the positive power of\nnonviolence as a social force. This is grounded in a consequentialist\nargument that active nonviolence can produce social goods like respect\nfor human rights as well as peace and reconciliation.\n\nThe basic theory and strategy of nonviolent action were worked out by\nMohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Gene Sharp, and\nothers who were engaged in nonviolent social protest in the\n20th Century. Although the roots of this approach can be\nfound in the long history of pacifism from Jesus onward, the\nGandhi-King approach both clarified the basic principles of nonviolent\nresistance and successfully put these principles into action in the\nIndian struggle for self-determination and in the American civil\nrights movement. One of the important contributions of this approach\nis the idea that there should be a coordination between means and\nends. Peaceful means should be employed in pursuit of the end of peace\nand justice.\n\nFor peaceful means of social change to be effective, they must be\ncoordinated and organized. Gandhi and King thought that the power of\nnonviolence was linked to its ability to motivate and move large\nnumbers of people. Pacifism as a personal stance will not be effective\nat creating social change: it requires a coordinated social\neffort.\n\nProponents of active nonviolence will claim that coordinated\nnonviolence can be successful even in the face of aggression.\nAdvocates of this position will point to the successes of Gandhi and\nKing. They will also point to the \u201cvelvet revolutions\u201d\nthat occurred in Eastern Europe in the late 1980\u2019s and early\n1990\u2019s. And they will point to the example of Lithuania in\n1990\u201391, when unarmed civilians succeeded in turning back Soviet\ntroops. Some initially viewed the so-called \u201cArab Spring\u201d\nthat began in late 2010 as an example of the power of nonviolence.\nHowever, subsequent oppression by military and police forces remind us\nof the fragility of nonviolent social movements. Proponents of\nnonviolent action argue that nonviolence could be even more effective\nif society focused its resources on training citizens for nonviolent\nresistance and on coordinating nonviolent action. The ideal here would\nbe a sort of nonviolent \u201carmy\u201d that is funded, trained,\nand coordinated for national self-defense in a way that mimics\nmilitary training. For pacifism to be effective, the social\nresources\u2014money, technology, and investment of labor and\ncreative power\u2014that are currently used for military training\nwould have to be converted to nonviolent applications. This idea draws\non what James called \u201cthe moral equivalent of war\u201d and\nwhat Gandhi called the \u201cnonviolent army.\u201d\n",
