    "main_text": "Kinds of Evil: Metaphysical and Empirical || Metaphysical Evil\n3.1 Metaphysical Evil\n\nMany of the traditional kakologists believed in metaphysical\nevil\u2014i.e., evil that has to do with the way things exist or\nfail to exist.  Typically, metaphysical evil is supposed to be a\nfunction of a thing\u2019s nature and characterized by a kind of\nunintelligiblity. As we have seen, many such theorists also typically\nassume that metaphysical evil has empirical manifestations.\n\nBoth metaphysical and empirical evil have been described in terms of\nfour main theory-templates: Absence, Matter, Privation, and\nReal Property. These templates are laid out in more detail in\nthe discussion of metaphysical evil in this section, and applied again\nin\n section 3.2\u2019s\n discussion of empirical evil.\n3.1.1 Absence Theory\n\nThe Absence Theory of Evil has its origins in the Platonic\nidea that there are different \u201cdegrees of being\u201d\ncorresponding to the number and kinds of capacities a thing has.\nRoughly speaking, the more numerous and impressive a thing\u2019s\ncapacities, the more real and thus better it is,\nmetaphysically-speaking. A dog cannot stand erect; an ape can. A rock\ncannot pass through walls; an angel can. These lacks or absences are\nessential to being the kind of finite creature that a dog or a rock\nis; miracles aside, a rock is just the kind of thing that cannot pass\nthrough walls. All the same, the lack of that ability is an evil.\n\nAbsence theorists typically add a \u201cplenum\u201d thesis here: it\nis fitting, or beautiful, or perhaps even necessary, that all\nthe different degrees of being are exemplified, and thus that every\nlink in the \u201cgreat chain of being\u201d is occupied. Evil is a\nfunction of the way things ought to be or even must be.\n\nAbsence Theory was popular across antiquity, but it was particularly\nattractive to philosophers in monotheistic traditions because it\nallowed them to say that evil is not a thing\u2014and thus\nnot some thing that a good, all-powerful God created or\nsustains. Anselm writes in On the Fall of the Devil:\n\n\nJust as nothing that is not good comes from the Supreme Good, and\nevery good is from the Supreme Good, likewise nothing that is not\nbeing [essentia] comes from the Supreme Being\n[essentia], and all being is from the Supreme Being. Since\nthe Supreme Good is the Supreme Being, it follows that every being is\na good thing and every good thing is a being. Therefore, just as\nnothing and non-being [non esse] are not being\n[essentia], likewise they are not good. So, nothing and\nnon-being are not from He from whom nothing is unless it is good and\nbeing. (De Casu Diaboli, v.1, 235; translation by Sadler\n [Other Internet Resources])\n\n\nA lingering problem in the theistic context, however, is that Absence\nTheory entails that finite things have a degree of evil just in\nvirtue of not being at the top of the chain. So even if God does\nnot create evil (because absence is uncreated), God creates\nbeings that are essentially evil.\n3.1.2 Matter Theory\n\nPlotinus rejects Absence Theory for a related reason: it compels\nus\n\n\nto say that there are evils in the higher world too; for there the\nSoul is inferior to Intellect, and Intellect is lesser than [the One].\n(Enneads I, 8, 13)\n\n\nFor Plotinus, it is not merely being lower than the highest\nOne that makes something evil; rather, evil consists in being so low\nas to be associated with matter. Indeterminate or \u201cunformed\nmatter\u201d is the final term on the cosmic chain from being to\nnon-being\u2014it is as far away from intelligence as possible, and\nthus equally far away from goodness. This is the Matter Theory of\nEvil that was influential in various gnosticisms, early Christian\nheresies, and late antique platonisms (see O\u2019Meara 2019).\n3.1.3 Privation Theory\n\nAugustine, as well as many scholastics and early moderns, rejected\nMatter Theory on religious grounds. God created matter, and\nso it cannot be bad in itself. Instead of reverting to pure Absence\nTheory, however, these monotheists developed the Privation Theory\nof Evil. This can be construed as Absence Theory plus the\nAristotelian idea that goodness is relative to a thing\u2019s\nkind. Individuals of different kinds have different ends\ndictated by their natures: as long as the dog achieves the ends set\nout by its nature, it counts as fully good of its canine\nkind, even if it essentially lacks the good-making capacities (or\n\u201crealities\u201d) of beings higher on the chain. (For more on\nAugustine\u2019s version, see King 2019; on Aquinas, see Davies\n2019).\n\nPrivation Theory thus reduces pressure on monotheism: evil is not a\nbeing but rather an absence, and so God did not create it. Moreover,\nevil is the kind of absence that is not a function of the\nessential natures of things, and so God cannot be faulted for creating\nthings that are essentially evil. Failing to accomplish the end set\nout by one\u2019s nature\u2014failing to be the way one\nought to be\u2014is a privation, however, and so it\nis evil.\n\nFriends of Privation Theory offer different accounts of how and why\nthings fail to accomplish their natural end. Most ascribe the failure\nto something in the individual creature\u2014culpable\nignorance, Original Sin, free agency\u2014rather than to God, thereby\ngrounding metaphysical evil in moral evil (on which see\n section 4.1\n below). The extent to which these appeals to privation succeed in\ngetting God off the hook is, naturally, controversial.\n\nPlotinus\u2019s view is effectively a hybrid of Privation Theory and\nMatter Theory: for him, privation only occurs when some of the matter\nin something is unformed or unmastered by a form (see Enneads\nI, 8, 5, 19\u201326). But even if other Privation Theorists do not\nview privation in this way, the conception of evil as infinitely\ndistant from reason and intelligibility survives. In other words,\nIgnorance, Original Sin, and other misuses of freedom are not\nnecessarily a function of irrational matter, but they are\nstill opposed to rational mind. Descartes is illustrative\nhere: for him, the only teleology (and privation) in the\nworld relates to the souls\u2014and in particular the wills\u2014of\nhuman beings. Material substance is mechanistic, and aggregates of it\n(in the forms of animals and plants) can be explained mechanistically,\nwithout invoking teleology or kind-relative values (compare Newlands\n2019).\n3.1.4 Real Property Theory\n\nA fourth major account of the nature of metaphysical evil takes it to\nbe something more substantive than absence, privation, or unformed\nmatter. Call this the Real Property Theory of Evil: evil is\nsome sort of reality\u2014a determinate feature of certain\nfinite beings (see J. Russell 1977, 1981, and Frankfurter 2006). Some\nversions of this picture say that evil is ultimately dependent on the\ngood. Other, more Manichaean versions take the two to be coeval and\nindependent, locked in an eternal axiological struggle. Although the\nrelevant \u201cproperty\u201d here is supposed to have more reality\nor substance than mere absence or privation, there is still a kind of\nunintelligibility to it. The evil side of reality, the dark force, or\nthe malevolent will is a kind of black hole for the \u201cnatural\nlight\u201d of reason\u2014positively real, but inaccessible to\ncomplete explanation.\n3.2 Empirical Evil\n\nEmpirical evil is a capacious category: it covers bodily\npain, damage, and disease as well as the psychological\nconcomitants or effects of these physical\nphenomena\u2014suffering, terror, depression, mental illness.\nTraditionally, it has also included social ills such as oppression,\npoverty, and structural injustice (see Sharpe 1909). Philosophers who\nbelieve in metaphysical evil often take them to manifest in empirical\nevils. Philosophers who reject metaphysical evil, by contrast, take\nthe empirical kind to be fundamental.\n\nCalling pain an evil might raise eyebrows, since clearly some pain is\nbeneficial: it protects us from collisions, diseases, and predators.\nBut the idea is that, whatever instrumental uses it has, pain qua\nphenomenal quality\u2014the feeling of it\u2014is\nintrinsically bad (setting aside for these purposes tricky\ncases like that of the masochist who takes pleasure in experiencing\npain). Pain in the horrendous amounts and kinds that we encounter in\nhuman history as well as in the \u201ccharnel house\u201d of\nevolutionary history is sickeningly and obviously bad (Murray 2008;\nMartin & Watkins 2019).\n\nThe templates used to characterize metaphysical evil above can be\napplied to empirical evil, too. An Absence Theory of\nempirical evil construes it simply as the absence of\nphysical-psychological states of pleasure, health, stability, justice,\nand even life. Matter Theory regards pain, disease, mental\nmalaise, and social ills as effects of our standing as material\nbeings, vulnerable to the \u201cmatter\u201d in our organism\nbreaking down or coming into conflict with other parts of material\ncreation. Privation Theory says that empirical evil is the\nabsence of some such good which ought to exist. There will\nthen be different accounts of why the good ought to exist, and why it\ndoesn\u2019t\u2014some of these will be based in a theory of\nmetaphysical evil.\n\nA Real Property Theory of empirical evil, by contrast,\ninsists that pain and suffering are positive realities and not mere\nabsences (it is thus compatible with Matter Theory, but not with\nAbsence or Privation Theory). As Malebranche notes, this is\nproblematic in theological contexts, since God is supposed to be the\nground of all positive beings (see Malebranche 1674\u20135 [1997: 348\nand 392]). In a letter to a mathematician named Arnold Eckhard, G.W.\nLeibniz discusses this issue, and suggests \u201cwith some\nscruples\u201d that \u201cpain too is a perfection\u201d (1677\n[1969: 177]). That is a fairly unusual view, one that is made\nparticularly poignant by the fact that Leibniz himself spent the last\nfew years of his life in immense pain. He apparently had a habit of\nsleeping in a chair near his writing desk, and it\n\n\nled to his having an open sore on his right leg. This caused him\ndifficulty in walking; he tried to remedy it, but only by putting\nblotting paper on it. Later, to reduce the pain and to make the nerves\ninsensitive he had a number of wooden clamps made, and these he\nscrewed onto himself wherever he felt pain. I suspect that by doing\nthis he so damaged his nerves that eventually he could no longer use\nhis feet and had to stay in bed. (Guhrauer 1842 [1966: vol 2, p.336];\nquoted in Mates 1989: 29)\n\n\nAlthough such pain is a \u201cperfection\u201d and thus a real\nproperty, for Leibniz, it still involves a kind of weakness or\nimperfection in the person who has it, and so God cannot, in\nthe end, exemplify this \u201cperfection\u201d. Rather, God\u2019s\npossession of maximal pleasure is somehow sufficient to ground the\n\u201creality\u201d that is found in both pleasure and pain (Leibniz\n1677 [1969: 177]). This seems fishy, and other philosophers argue\nagainst Leibniz that if pain is a real property (rather than a mere\nabsence), then God as the \u201cground of all reality\u201d must\nindeed exemplify it. Some recent theologians and philosophers even\nwelcome this idea, arguing that a conception of God as grounding\nempirical evil by suffering it has advantages for projects in\ntheodicy (Hartshorne 1984; Wolterstorff 1988).\n\nMental illnesses can be classified as \u201cempirical evils\u201d if\nwe assume that they have empirical causes and neural bases\n(Bhattacharjee 2018). Such illness often generates further empirical\nevil in the form of inexplicably cruel or destructive behavior to self\nand others, as will be familiar to anyone who has tried to live (or\nlove someone) with mental illnesses like posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and so on. It\nis unclear whether the theologians just mentioned would want to say\nthat this kind of empirical evil, too, must have its ground in the\ndivine by way of exemplification. The theological consequences of such\na suggestion seem unattractive, to say the least.\n4. Origins of Evil: Moral and Natural\n4.1 Moral Evil\n\nMoral evil is metaphysical or empirical evil that arises out\nof the acts or intentions of agents: other traditional terms for it\ninclude \u201csin\u201d, \u201cwickedness\u201d,\n\u201ctrespass\u201d, and \u201ciniquity\u201d.\n\nPhilosophers in the Abrahamic tradition typically hold that we can be\ndamaged by moral evil even before we have performed any\nactions whatsoever. Augustine, for example, characterizes Original Sin\nas a result of a primordial choice that damaged our very\nnature such that each member of the species is born already worthy of\ninfinite punishment and strongly inclined to engage in further moral\nevil. So this is a case of metaphysical evil that has its origin in\nmoral evil: bad choices on the part of the forefather led to damaged\nnatures all the way down the spermatic line.\n\nSuch metaphysical evil will often manifest in empirical evil (although\nit need not do so); it also makes it likely that there will be further\nmetaphysical evil. Thus an initial moral choice starts off a kind of\nsnowballing into hellishness. It is clear why ancient and medieval and\neven some contemporary responses to the \u201cUnde\nMalum?\u201d question focus on how a morally uncorrupted\ncreature (Adam, Eve, or Lucifer) could have started the process in the\nfirst place (see, e.g., Anselm De Casu Diaboli, vol.1 and\nJohnston forthcoming).\n\nKant appropriates this idea in a modern context, arguing that we are\nall originally afflicted by a propensity to moral evil\n(Hang zum B\u00f6sen), even apart from any specific actions\nthat we perform. This \u201cradical evil\u201d\u2014the\nmetaphysical evil at the root of our nature\n(\u201cradix\u201d = Latin for \u201croot\u201d)\u2014is\nsomething for which not Adam but we as individual agents (or\nperhaps the species itself) are somehow responsible. And this\nis reflected even in garden-variety peccadillos: any act that\nsubordinates commitment to the moral law to something else is an\nexpression of radical evil. This makes it clear that people who use\n\u201cradical evil\u201d to refer to something particularly\nhorrendous or awful (Arendt 1951, Bernstein 2002) are departing from\nthe Kantian concept (see\n Section 7\n below). That said, whether it is intelligible to say that we are\nculpable for a status that is not temporal is a notoriously\nopen question in Kant-interpretation (see Card 2010, Wood 2010, and\nother essays in Anderson-Gold & Muchnik 2010).\n\nAlthough moral evildoing often leads to empirical evil, it\nneedn\u2019t do so, at least on non-utilitarian accounts. Some crimes\ncan be \u201cvictimless\u201d at the empirical level.\n\nOnce again, the four traditional theoretical templates can be used to\nfurther characterize the evil acts and intentions that make an evil\n\u201cmoral\u201d.  Absence Theory says that the\nabsence of a good will\u2014either because something lacks a\nwill altogether, or because its will is not good\u2014is evil just by\nway of being an absence. Privation Theory says that a will is\nevil when it ought not have the absence of good orientation\nthat it does. Matter Theory says that our embodiment and\nother engagements with matter explain the misorientation of our will.\nReal Property Theory insists that a will that is oriented to\nthe bad is a real thing, and that its orientation to the bad\nis a real feature of it, not just a privation.\n\nDeclaring that moral evil is rooted in the will does not fully\nexplain it. We would need a further account of how\nevil choices are made\u2014of what sort of moral psychology could\nexplain them. For Kant, explanation ceases at some point; evil\nchoices, at bottom, are irrational\u2014surds that we can identify\nand impute, but never fully explain. \u201cThere is no conceivable\nground for us, therefore, from which moral evil could first have come\nin us\u201d (Kant 1793 [AK 6:43; 1998: 64]).\n\nOther philosophers offer partial explanations. Augustine says that\nalthough there is no determining cause of the devil\u2019s\nchoice, it is able to be partly \u201crationalized\u201d in terms of\nSatan\u2019s self-obsessed delight in his own powers (see King 2019).\nThis is an early version of what is now called a\n\u201cdispositional\u201d account of evil agency (L. Russell 2014:\nch.10; Kamtekar 2019). Early Islamic interpreters of the Qu\u2019ran,\nby contrast, offer explanations in terms of ignorance: there is\nsomething that the supremely evil agent (Iblis) didn\u2019t realize,\nor an inference that he failed to make, and this is what explains his\norientation to the bad (see Germann 2019).\n\nMoral evil is what contemporary people\u2014including\nphilosophers\u2014tend to have in mind when they talk of\n\u201cevil\u201d. Extreme forms of it are viewed by many\nphilosophers view as \u201cunintelligible\u201d\u2014as defying\nordinary explanation in significant and threatening ways. Such extreme\nand unintelligible moral evils are what many philosophers (though not\nKant) are referring to when they speak of \u201cradical\u201d evil\n(Arendt 1951; L. Russell 2014; see also\n Section 7).\n4.2 Natural Evil\n\nNatural evil refers to metaphysical and/or empirical evils\nwhose origins are \u201cnatural\u201d\u2014i.e., grounded in the\nnatures of things and/or the natural laws. The very nature of a horse\nmakes it incapable of language: if that incapacity is a metaphysical\nevil (as it would be on Absence Theory), then given its origin it also\ncounts as a natural rather than a moral evil. Likewise, cancer,\npandemics, earthquakes, meteor strikes, aging and perhaps even death\nitself are (typically) regarded as natural rather than moral evils. In\nthe tradition there are characterizations of natural evil that use one\nor more of the four templates discussed earlier: Absence,\nPrivation, malfunctions in Matter, or some other\nReal Property.\n\nOutside of religious contexts, however, many philosophers (and people\ngenerally) will be reluctant to characterize hurricanes, diseases, and\nmeteor strikes as a source of \u201cevil\u201d. The very idea of\nnatural evil seems most at home in theological debates: can\nthe Author of Nature be supremely good, wise, and powerful and yet\nstill create a world that contains so much pain and suffering, not to\nmention Category Five hurricanes, animal predation, and\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease?\n\nThere are different kinds of responses to the problem of natural evil\nin theological traditions: Aesthetic responses say that we\ndon\u2019t presently have the right perspective to see the overall\nbeauty of the natural system, and thus that there really is no natural\nevil; Soul-making responses say that this present vale of\nnatural evil is justified because it gives us the chance to become\nvirtuous; Skeptical theistic responses say that given our\nlimited faculties we cannot reasonably expect to understand\nwhy God would allow natural evils. (For more on these responses see M.\nAdams 1998, Tooley 2002 [2019]).\n\nA very different kind of response involves recharacterizing at least\nsome natural evils as moral evils. For instance, we might focus on\nways in which human activity has set in motion the kinds of\nenvironmental, climatic, microbial, and biospheric changes that lead\nto \u201cnatural\u201d disasters, pandemics, famines, and other\nempirical evils. Or, in a more religious context, we might seek to\nexplain the suffering and misery caused by \u201cnature\u201d by\nappeal to sin, karmic law, or divine justice.\n\nOn some versions of this view, the morally responsible agent can be\nsomeone other than the victim: Adam sins, and now the non-human\n\u201ccreation has been growning\u201d (Romans 8:22,\nNRSV)\u2014and makes the rest of us groan along with it. Or: we emit\nthe greenhouse gasses, and our descendants three generations later\nsuffer.\n\nOther versions insist that the fault lies with the victim of natural\nevil himself: Eliphaz the Temanite says to Job\n\n\nThink now, who that was innocent ever perished?\n\nOr where were the upright cut off?\n\nAs I have seen, those who plow iniquity\n\nand sow trouble reap the same.\n\nBy the breath of God they perish,\n\nand by the blast of his anger they are consumed.\n\nThe roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion,\n\nand the teeth of the young lions are broken.\n\n(Job 4: 7\u201310, NRSV)\n\n\nEliphaz suggests that if Job continues to suffer, then there must be\nsome explanation for these natural evils in Job\u2019s own past\nbehavior. The risk in this kind of doctrine will be obvious to less\nancient sensibilities: to suggest that a victim of natural evil must\nbe morally responsible for it seems like the very definition of adding\ninsult to injury.\n\nAnother way to recharacterize natural evil as moral evil is by\nappealing to the actions of moral agents who are neither divine nor\nhuman. This appears to have been Augustine\u2019s position in places;\nmore recently, it has been invoked by Alvin Plantinga as an at least\nbroadly logically possible scenario which could be used in a\n\u201cdefense\u201d against the logical problem of evil (Tooley 2002\n[2019]). The scenario says that\n\n\n[n]atural evil is due to the free actions of nonhuman persons; there\nis a balance of good over evil with respect to the actions of these\nnonhuman persons; and it was not within the power of God to create a\nworld that contains a more favorable balance of good over evil with\nrespect to the actions of the nonhuman persons it contains. (Plantinga\n1989: 58)\n\n\nA final way to recharacterize natural evil as moral would simply be to\nhold God alone morally blameworthy for it, since God created\na world in which sentient creatures suffer so terribly. Obviously this\nwould not be a winning strategy if the goal is a successful theodicy.\nIndeed, some theistic traditions block this route a priori by\nsaying that it is conceptually impossible for God to do wrong: a\nperfect creator is either unbound by moral principles, or essentially\nincapable of violating them (see Murphy 2017).\n\nIf these efforts to locate a moral basis for natural evil (whether\nempirical or metaphysical) are unsuccessful, then\n\u201cnatural\u201d remains a distinct category of evil\u2019s\norigin.\n\nHere again is our Table of Evils, now with more examples that go\nbeyond Nietzsche\u2019s horse case:\n\n\n\n\nOrigins:\nNatural\nMoral\nSpooky non-agential \n\nKinds:\n\u00a0\n\n\nMetaphysical\nThe finitude and other limitations that are essential to an\nindividual or species-nature and that are ultimately based in facts\nabout natures.\nThe finitude, limitations, and corruption that are essential to\nan individual or species-nature and the result of damage to natures,\nwhich damage is ultimately based in facts about immoral acts and\nintentions (e.g., Original Sin)\nThe finitude, limitations, and corruption that are essential to\nan individual or species-nature and are ultimately based in facts\nabout a dark force or shadow-side principle in reality. \n\nEmpirical\nPain, suffering, and illness (including mental) whose ultimate\nexplanation consists in causal facts (e.g., aging, accidents, genetic\ndefects, disasters and other natural phenomena).\nPain, suffering, and illness (including mental) whose ultimate\nexplanation consists in facts about immoral acts and intentions (e.g.,\ninterpersonal violence, social ills, self-harm)\nPain, suffering, and illness (including mental) whose ultimate\nexplanation consists in facts about a dark force or shadow-side\nprinciple in reality.  \n\n\nFigure 2. The Table of Evils, with\ngeneral examples\n\n\nSome types of evil do not seem to fit nicely in the Table of Evils.\nThe three dealt with in what follows are systemic evil, symbolic\nevil, and radical evil. The nature and the origins of\nsuch evils are difficult to discern, and may require an expansion of\nthe Table.\n5. Systemic Evil\n\nSystemic evil is the kind of evil that exists at the level of\nsystems or groups rather than merely at the level of individuals.\nOrganized structures like governments, corporations, teams, and\nreligious institutions can be evil in this way; so can more\nloosely-organized systems such as \u201cAcademia\u201d, \u201cWhite\nSupremacy\u201d, and \u201cWall Street\u201d. Indeed, Google\nincludes the motto \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d in\nits Company Code of Conduct (for the origins of this, see\nChang 2019); disgruntled employees later sued the company alleging\nthat it had violated that pledge (Allyn 2021).\n\nSystemic evil seems empirical rather than metaphysical, but its\norigins are difficult to identify. It does not appear to be a merely\nnatural phenomenon, or a spooky non-agential one, and yet its\nsupra-agential character makes it seem not entirely moral either.\n\nHannah Arendt\u2019s early work on totalitarianism (1951) depicts\nsystemic evil as a kind of empirical evil for which no\nindividual or even collection of individuals is fully responsible. The\ncogs in the machine, as well as the leader or leadership, may be the\norigin of some of the harms involved, but the evil of the whole\nstructure (on Arendt\u2019s view) is somehow greater than the sum\nproduced by its parts.\n\nRacism is another prominent example of systemic evil. Recent accounts\nof entrenched racist structures in certain societies (the United\nStates, for instance) suggest that such evil has its origin not merely\nin actions and intentions but also in omissions and\npassivity: people who do not explicitly support the\nsystemic evil can count as agents of it. If this is right, then active\nwork against the evil in question\u2014\u201canti-racist\u201d\nactivity rather than \u201cnon-racist\u201d activity, for\nexample\u2014becomes morally required (Kendi 2019). But even such\nactive opposition efforts may not be sufficient to avoid complicity in\nsystemic evil: some theorists argue that even anti-racist people\nliving in racist societies are \u201ctainted\u201d by its evil all\nthe same (Rothstein 2017). That leads to the next kind of problem\ncase.\n6. Symbolic Evil\n\nSymbolic value is a less familiar idea in philosophy than it\nis in Anthropology, Religious Studies, and the other social sciences\nthat deal with production, exchange, and consumption. The main idea is\nthat an object or act can have far more \u201csymbolic\u201d value\nto a certain individual than its exchange or monetary value on some\nmarket or other, typically because of its causal history. That bauble\ngiven to you by a now-deceased friend has far more symbolic value (to\nyou, at least) than the monetary or exchange value that it would fetch\nat auction. This is because the gift had its origin in the generosity\nof a friend who has since died, has the ability to invoke his memory,\nand so on.\n\nSymbolic disvalue works in an analogous way. Products that\nfetch a certain monetary value on an open market may have significant\nsymbolic disvalue that is not reflected in their price. This\ndisvalue often arises, again, from the product\u2019s provenance: an\nindustrial chicken sandwich is a result of the obscene degradation of\nanimals, workers, and the environment on the part of an industry that\npays revolving-door lobbyists to promote food policy that, in turn,\nkeeps production costs and prices artificially low, in part by\nexternalizing most of the harms it causes. In some cases, such\ndisvalue may be significant enough to make purchasing the product\nwrong, even if doing so does not lead, causally, to any actual harm or\nrights-infringement (see Chignell 2016).\n\nThe term \u201cevil\u201d is typically only applied in cases of\nsymbolic disvalue when there is something excessive about them.\nStepping on a flag or consuming a chicken sandwich might have some\nsymbolic disvalue, but it would be strange to say that these are cases\nof symbolic evil. Having anything to do with soap made from\nthe body fat of people murdered at the Stutthof concentration camp, by\ncontrast, seems downright evil, even if the intended consequences\n(i.e., getting oneself clean) are good. Indeed, the symbolic evil\nattached to such a product may \u201ctouch\u201d everyone who was\npart of the society that permitted its manufacture, whether they were\ndirectly involved or not. The evil of sustained chattel slavery may\nhave a similar sort of symbolic power, even generations later.\n\nBoth the nature and the origins of symbolic evil are hard to\ncharacterize; thus it is hard to see where it fits in the Table of\nEvils. Is there a metaphysical aspect to symbolic evil, or is it fully\nempirical? Is its origin entirely natural, or moral, or is there\nsomething spooky and non-agential about it? A related set of\ndifficulties has to do with the fact that, in some contexts anyway,\nthe transfer of symbolic disvalue operates via the complex logic of\n\u201ctaint\u201d, contagion, or uncleanness. Some philosophers who\nwrite about symbolic value argue that the only way to avoid being\n\u201ctouched\u201d by such evil is via active and explicit\ndissociation\u2014a symbolic \u201cstanding with the\ngood\u201d (R. Adams 1999). In other words, even if our abstinence\ndoes not make a difference, we must symbolically oppose an\nevil practice by, say, explicitly signaling opposition and (where\npossible) refusing to consume or benefit from its results (see Hill\n1983; Appiah 1986).\n7. Radical Evil: Four Conceptions\n\nKant is the source of \u201cradical evil\u201d, but his way of using\nthe term is now out of favor. In fact, most people writing on this\nissue use the term in a precisely non-Kantian way to refer to\nsomething spectacularly excessive\u2014an act or event whose badness\nis deeper and more mysterious than the badness of ordinary states or\nactivities (Bernstein 2002).\n\nIn her famous account of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem,\nArendt (1963) promoted the idea that even the worst evils can be\n\u201cbanal\u201d and bureaucratical. A decade earlier, however, she\nconceived of \u201cradical evil\u201d quite differently. In a March\n1951 letter to Karl Jaspers she wrote:\n\n\nWe know that the greatest evils or radical evil has nothing to do\nanymore with humanly understandable, sinful motives. What radical evil\nis I don\u2019t know, but it seems to me to somehow have to do with\nthe following phenomenon: making human beings as human beings\nsuperfluous. (Arendt & Jaspers 1992: 166, emphasis added)\n\n\nArendt went on in the letter to insist that \u201cmaking human beings\nas human beings superfluous\u201d is not the same as treating them as\n\u201cmere means to an end\u201d. She thus rejected the Kantian view\nthat radical evil\u2014no matter how benign or awful the\neffects\u2014has its root (Latin: radix) in the willful\nviolation of the categorical imperative by individual free agents (see\nLouden 2010: 98).\n\nJaspers\u2019s view of radical evil, by contrast, was consistently\nnon-exotic and Kantian: \u201cthere is evil because there is freedom.\nIt is only possible for the will alone to be evil\u201d\n(Jaspers 1947 [1958: 532], emphasis added). According to one\ncommentator, this focus on human freedom as the root of all\nevil is \u201csignificant and commendable\u201d:\n\n\nKant [and following him Jaspers] refuses to cater to our prurient\ncraving for a special account that applies especially to the most\nextreme cases of evil\u2026. He fears that occupying our\nimaginations with extreme cases of evil may be merely a way of\nindulging some of our nastier human traits\u2014rationalizing our\nresentment and vindictiveness by supplying it with an object that\nwould seem to justify it. (Wood 2010: 157)\n\n\nThe concerns expressed in these passages are common in discussions of\nthe nature and origins of evil. Call them Jaspersian concerns\nfor short. They are second-order concerns about how we should conceive\nand speak of evil, especially when calling it \u201cradical\u201d.\nThe concerns fall into two broad kinds: (1) concerns about\nexoticizing wrongdoing with excess-locutions like\n\u201cevil\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d; and (2) concerns about\ntainting people and things that are touched by such evil,\nbeyond the straightforward condemnation of the perpetrators (for more\non such concerns, see Card 2002, Cole 2006, and Calder 2013\n[2018]).\n\nThe Kantian conception of radical evil is considered in the next\nsub-section. Sections 7.2\u20137.4 survey three other conceptions and\nlook at how each might raise Jaspersian concerns.\n7.1 Radical Evil as Violation of the Moral Law\n\nKant argues in Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone\n(1793) that free choices against the moral law are unintelligible in\nthe sense that they are irrational; our propensity to make\nthem is thus an inexplicable mystery at the \u201croot\u201d\n(radix) of our moral psychology. The post-Kantian idealist\nF.W. J. Schelling, picking up the refrain, rejects the Privation\nTheory of radical evil in favor of the view that it has its origin in\nthe positive, irrational decision to prefer self-advantage over the\nmoral law, though \u201cjust how the decision for good or evil comes\nto pass in the individual, that is still wrapped in total\ndarkness\u201d (Schelling 1809 [1936: 59]).\n\nOn the Kantian view of radical evil, then, there is a normative sense\nin which it is \u201cunintelligible\u201d: it is an\nirrational propensity and thus cannot be\n\u201cunderstood\u201d in the sense that it cannot be sanctioned by\nproper reason. Likewise, an immoral choice cannot be fully explained:\nfull explanations appeal to good reasons, and there are no good\nreasons for wrongdoing.\n\nThere is a broader sense of \u201cunderstand\u201d or\n\u201cexplain\u201d, however, in which such evil is no mystery at\nall: it is the most depressingly familiar thing in the world. Everyday\nimmoral agents presumably see what they are doing under the aspect of\nsome good or other\u2014good for their company, good for\ntheir bonuses, good for their reelection efforts\u2014even if they\nalso know that what they are doing is ultimately wrong. If we\ninterpret the war cry of Milton\u2019s Satan\u2014\u201cEvil be\nthou my good!\u201d (1667, Paradise Lost, Bk IV, line\n110)\u2014as implying that he is taking evil under the guise of the\ngood, then it is not absurd. But it is still not wholly\nintelligible, either.\n\nThe Kantian conception of radical evil, then, says that that the\nunintelligibility of wrongdoing does not prevent us from assigning\nblame, holding perpetrators responsible, and refusing to taint the\ninnocent. This explains why Jaspers found the conception so\nattractive:\n\n\nTo rank the will to happiness, which dominates among men\u2019s\nmotives, above the unconditioned law that shows itself in\nreason\u2014that is the root of evil, the\n\u201cpropensity\u201d which Kant calls \u201cradical evil\u201d.\n(Jaspers 1962: 321)\n\n7.2. Radical Evil as Choosing Evil for its own Sake\n\nSome philosophers, and more than a few novelists and screenwriters,\nfind the view that agents are always choosing under \u201cthe guise\nof the good\u201d as inadequate to the psychology of extreme\nmalevolence. It may have suited the melioristic conceptions of the\nEnlightenment, but the well-publicized, mechanized horrors of the\nrecent past allegedly demand a bleaker picture of perpetrator\npsychology. Serial killers, murderous dictators, torturers,\nderivatives traders: the idea is that at least some of these malign\nactors see their own actions as atrocious\u2014as making the\nworld worse rather than better on the whole (and sometimes worse for\nthemselves)\u2014and yet still choose to perform them. They are thus\nnot saying \u201cEvil be thou my good\u201d, at least on the\ninterpretation just offered. Rather, they are self-consciously\nmale-volent: they will the bad under the aspect of the\nbad. And yet they are not insane\u2014this is what makes their\nactions especially difficult for the rest of us to understand. This is\na second common way in which the term \u201cradical evil\u201d is\nused. (See Pauer-Studer and Velleman 2015 for a reading of Milton\naccording to which Satan\u2019s war cry is interpreted in this\nway.)\n\nAugustine reports in his Confessions that during the pears\nincident he took pleasure in\n\n\nthe theft and sin itself.\u2026 Behold, now, let me heart tell Thee\nwhat it was seeking there, that I should be gratuitously wanton,\nhaving no inducement to evil but the evil itself. It was foul, and I\nloved it \u2026 I loved my own error \u2013 not that for which I\nerred, but the error itself. (Confessions Bk 2, Chap. IV,\nparagraph 9 [1876: 30])\n\n\nIt is tempting to say that in \u201cloving the sin itself\u201d,\nAugustine was in some sense taking it to be good. But he at least\ngestures here at this second conception of radical evil: some acts can\nbe performed under the aspect of their own abject deformation and\nrottenness\u2014as ultimately bad even for the agent himself.\n\nAs we have seen, the Prussian philosopher who coined the term\n\u201cradical evil\u201d 1400 years later did not think\nthat it can involve choosing evil for its own sake. In fact, Kant\nargues that such a \u201cdiabolical\u201d conception of evil is\nincoherent or at least psychologically inapplicable to human beings.\nKant\u2019s skepticism, however, did not prevent Dostoyevsky from\ncomposing Notes from the Underground (1864) as an extended\nand somewhat plausible portrait of one man\u2019s effort to choose\nevil qua evil. And there are more recent accounts of people\nwho confess\u2014in private diaries or braggadocios\ndepositions\u2014that they did what they did because it was\nevil.\n\nIn this context, consider (if you can bear it) Stone 2009\u2019s\nportraits of the worst serial killers: although some perpetrators\nreport that they take what they are doing to be good\u2014ridding the\nworld of \u201cgarbage women\u201d, giving someone his \u201cjust\ndeserts\u201d, correctly following the orders of the voices in their\nhead, and so on\u2014others openly admit that what they are doing is\nbad, wrong, evil, despicable, and so on. In such cases, the\nperpetrators are not making a series of unsound inferences, or\nmistaking the bad for the good. Rather, they seem to be engaged in a\nself-conscious turning away from anything that could be regarded as\ngood by anyone. Radical evil on this conception is sometimes\ndescribed as a self-conscious turning away from being itself\n(Eagleton 2009: 16; L. Russell 2014: 23).\n\nIf Augustine\u2019s confessions about the pears\u2014or these more\nspectacular recent confessions\u2014are accurate, then there may be\n(contra Kant) a baffling diabolical state that some people\ncan fall into, and that the rest of us cannot entirely fathom. The\nunintelligibility here thus threatens to raise Jaspersian concerns\nabout exoticization and taint.\n7.3. Radical Evil as Repudiation of the Moral Law\n\nA third conception of \u201cradical evil\u201d takes the term to\nrefer to acts or practices (like slavery and genocide) that do not\nmerely violate rational principles but also constitute an effort to\nrepudiate moral rationality altogether, or at least to\ntranscend it. When we steal or lie, there is a sense in which we might\nbe failing to treat others with the respect that they deserve. And as\nwe have seen, Kant does not hesitate to view such irrational choices\nas stemming from our propensity to \u201cradical evil\u201d. But\nradical evil on this third conception is different: it involves an\nintentional refusal to acknowledge that some group of persons has\nany moral standing at all\u2014the kind of moral standing\nthat would prohibit us from instigating or complying with their\nhumiliation, degradation, or extinction.\n\nRadical evil of this sort, in other words, denies the universal\nscope\u2014and thus, perhaps, the very existence\u2014of the moral\nsphere altogether. It is anti-rational rather than merely\nirrational: this is what threatens to make it incomprehensible or\ninexplicable in a unique way. This is also presumably what the early\nArendt means when she says that radical evil involves making human\nbeings \u201csuperfluous\u201d.\n\nBy way of analogy: suppose that ordinary moral wrongdoing is like\nmaking a bad move in chess, or like cheating by moving one\u2019s\npieces in an illegal way when one\u2019s opponent isn\u2019t\nlooking. A radically evil act on the present conception, by contrast,\nwould be like crushing all of the opponent\u2019s pieces and upending\nthe table. The player who does the latter is no longer or perhaps\nnever was a player: she cannot explain her behavior by saying that she\nwas trying to win by making what turned out to be a bad move or a\ncheat. She cannot explain her behavior in terms of chess at\nall. Likewise, a radically evil act is supposed to transcend the terms\nof moral rationality.\n\nThe analogy extends only so far, however. That\u2019s because there\nare still some reasonable explanations left to our\nnon-player\u2014explanations external to the game:\n\n\nI was hungry, so I crushed all of your pieces and swept them off the\nboard in the hopes that you would suggest lunch.\n\n\nBy contrast, it is not obvious how there can be any credible\nreason given for doing something that constitutes a denial of\nreason altogether. That is why radical evil in the\nrepudiative sense threatens to be uniquely unintelligible and\ntroubling. If someone\u2014not a beast or a machine, but a human\nbeing\u2014acts in a way that entirely disclaims not just an\nawareness of moral authority but also the basic rules of moral reason\naltogether, he effectively places himself in an antelapsarian state,\nunburdened with the knowledge of good and evil. His act asserts that\nhe has transcended entirely the moral sphere\u2014that what he does\ncannot be wrong.\n\nCan human beings really perpetrate radical evil in this sense? Richard\nRamirez, the \u201cNight Stalker\u201d serial killer in 1980\u2019s\nLos Angeles, certainly took himself to be doing so. He repeatedly\nsnuck into people\u2019s houses to rape and kill them, sometimes\ncutting off body parts and taking them with him. After his fourteenth\nmurder, he was caught and then boasted to his captors:\n\n\nYou don\u2019t understand me\u2026 you are not capable of it. I am\nbeyond good and evil\u2026I love to kill people. I love to watch\nthem die. I would shoot them in the head and they would wiggle and\nsquirm\u2026 I love all that blood. (quoted in Stone 2009: 208).\n\n\nThis idea\u2014that a human being could do something that would\nenact his own transcendence of moral norms, make other\npersons superfluous, and establish his own status as somehow\n\u201cbeyond good and evil\u201d\u2014is what concerned Karl\nJaspers, and what he was hoping Arendt would resist. In her\nface-to-face confrontation with the quotidian, bureaucratic evil of\nAdolf Eichmann, she seems to have changed her mind (though see\nCesarani 2007 and Margalit 2019 for a portrait of Eichmann that\nresists her famous \u201cbanality thesis\u201d). But even if Arendt\nultimately repudiated the repudiative conception of radical evil,\nothers remain sympathetic to some version of it (e.g., Bernstein 2002\nand Motzkin 2019).\n7.4. Radical Evil as Systemic Evil: Human Beings Made Superfluous in Another Way\n\n\u201cSystemic\u201d or \u201cstructural\u201d evil exists at the\nlevel of groups, networks, races, and collectives rather than merely\nat the level of individuals (see\n section 5).\n The fourth conception of \u201cradical evil\u201d applies the\nconcept to particularly rampant or entrenched evils of the systemic\nsort.\n\nAlthough Arendt\u2019s interest was in totalitarian state systems,\ncontemporary philosophers are equally interested in non-state but\nstill super-human systems: corporations, collectives, markets,\nartificial intelligences. These are now some of the most potent\nsources of value and disvalue at work in the world. As noted in\n section 5,\n the nature of systemic evil is empirical, but its origin is more\ndifficult to grasp. Corporations have boardrooms and executive suites,\nand are even treated as persons by some legal systems, but (as\ninvestigation after investigation indicates) it is hard to find the\nheart of their darkness when assigning responsibility. Still-powerful\nsystems of white supremacy are based in structures of which no\nindividual human mind was or is fully aware (Rothstein 2017).\nLikewise, markets, algorithms, blockchains, and various forms of\nartificial intelligence arise out of innumerable individual human\nefforts, but are also designed to make human beings\nsuperfluous in a literal and unprecedented way. Some of this is and\nwill be for the good\u2014there are already fewer back-broken menial\nlaborers in the fields or exhaust-guzzling toll collectors on the\nhighways. But some will surely be for the bad, and in ways that are\nnot foreseeable. Radical systemic evil\u2014especially in a\ntechnological age\u2014does not seem natural or spooky, but it does\nnot seem fully moral either.\n\nIn sum: although natural, moral, and spooky non-agential conceptions\nof the origins of evil were the focus of most traditional discussions\nof the origins of evil, it looks like some varieties of radical evil\nhave a different origin altogether\u2014one that is not entirely\nintelligible. This raises Jaspersian concerns: a world in which\n(non-Kantian) radical evils are widespread is one in which ascriptions\nof moral responsibility are increasingly difficult to make.",
