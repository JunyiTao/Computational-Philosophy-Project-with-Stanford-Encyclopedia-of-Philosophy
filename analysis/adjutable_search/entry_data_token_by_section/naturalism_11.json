    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism || A Role for Intuitions\n2.4 A Role for Intuitions\nThe challenge to philosophical intuitions is clear enough. Either\nthey are analytic, in which they contain no substantial information,\nor they are synthetic, in which case they are of dubious\nreliability.[15] \n Given this, a number of philosopher of\nnaturalist inclinations advocate a revisionary attitude to\nphilosophical method. Philosophy should turn away from intuitions, and\ninstead engage directly with proper observational evidence. (Kornblith\n2002, Knobe and Nichols 2008.)\nHowever, this is not the only possible reaction. We would do well to remember that intuitions arguably plays a role in science as well as philosophy. The history of science displays a number of important thought experiments, like Galileo\u2019s analysis of free fall, or the Einstein\u2019s argument against the completeness of quantum mechanics. And intuition functions here very much as it does in philosophy. The scientist imagines some possible situation, and then makes an intuitive judgement about what would happen.\nIn such cases, it is clearly not mere analytic definitions that are at issue. An eminently synthetic claim\u2014say, that heavier bodies fall faster\u2014is undermined by a contrary intuition\u2014if a big and small body are tied together, they will be heavier than the big one, but will not fall faster. This thought is clearly not guaranteed by concepts alone, but by synthetic assumptions about the way the world works.\nStill, this kind of example still faces the second horn of the dilemma about intuitions. If the intuitions involve substantial synthetic claims, why should we take them to be reliable? The historical track record of intuitions is scarcely any better in science than in philosophy. In both realms it would seem wiser to avoid unreliable intuitions and engage directly with observational evidence.\nHowever, there is a way of understanding the role of intuitions in both science and philosophy that evades this worry. Instead of viewing them as designed to elicit authoritative judgments to which philosophical theories must defer, they can instead be seen as devices\nwhich help us to articulate our implicit assumptions when we are\nthreatened with paradox and have difficulty finding a solution.\nRecall a point made at the beginning of our discussion of\nmethodological naturalism. Philosophical problems are typically\noccasioned by some kind of theoretical tangle. Different but equally\nplausible lines of though lead us to conflicting conclusions.\nUnraveling this tangle requires that we lay out different theoretical\ncommitments and see what might be rejected or modified. A useful\nheuristic for this purpose may well be to use intuitions about\nimaginary cases to uncover the implicit synthetic assumptions that are\nshaping our thinking. This can help us better to appreciate our\noverall theoretical alternatives, and assess which gives the best\noverall fit with the a posteriori evidence.\nThis perspective on philosophical thought experiments shows why we\nshould positively expect many of the intuitions they elicit to prove\nwanting. Perhaps there are contexts outside philosophy where various\nkinds of a priori intuitions can be relied upon. But if\nphilosophical problems typically arise because we are unsure about\nwhat exactly is amiss in the overall set of synthetic claims we bring\nto the world, then it would seem only to be expected that the fault\nwill often lie in the implicit intuitions driving our judgements about cases.\nIt is worth noting that this often happens with scientific thought\nexperiments too. Galileo\u2019s intuition that light bodies fall as\nfast as heavy ones was vindicated by subsequent physics. But the\nverdict can also go the other way. For example, the assumption behind\nthe Einstein\u2019s argument against the completeness of quantum\nmechanics is nowadays rejected. But this certainly did not mean that\nhis thought experiment was worthless. On the contrary, it led J. S.\nBell to the derivation of the eponymous inequality whose experimental\nconfirmation ruled out local hidden variable theories.\nIt is not hard to think of similar philosophical cases. The worth\nof philosophical thought-experiments does not always require that the\nintuitions they elicit are sound. Consider the classic Lockean set-up\nwhere someone\u2019s memories are transferred to a new body. We all\nhave an intuition that the person goes with the memories, not the old\nbody, as evidenced by our reactions to the many fictions which trade\non just this kind of scenario. But few philosophers of personal\nidentity would nowadays hold that this intuition is decisive in favour\nof Lockeanism. Again, consider the intuition that conscious properties\nare ontologically distinct from physical ones, as displayed in our\nimmediate reaction to zombie scenarios. Here too, few would suppose\nthat these intuitions by themselves decide the case. Still, even those\nwho reject Lockeanism and dualism will allow that reflection on\nmemory-switching and zombie cases has played a crucial role in\nclarifying what is at issue in the debates. The evocation of\nintuitions by philosophical thought experiments is important, not\nbecause they provide some special kind of a priori evidence,\nbut simply because they need to be made explicit and assessed against\nthe overall a posteriori evidence.[16]\nThis perspective on thought experiments shows that there is a sense\nin which recent developments within \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy\u201d can be viewed as complementing traditional armchair\nmethods. In the previous section we saw that some of the findings of\nexperimental philosophy carry the implication that everyday intuitions\nare not generally reliable. But in addition to this\n\u201cnegative\u201d message, there is also room for experimental\nphilosophy to make a positive philosophical contribution, even in\ncases where there is no variation in intuitions.\nCareful experimental probing can helpfully augment traditional\narmchair methods as a way of identifying the structure of implicit\nassumptions that drive intuitive judgments about test cases.\nSometimes thought experiments may be enough. But in more complicated\ncases systematic questionnaires and surveys may well be a better way\nof identifying the implicit cognitive structures behind our\nphilosophical reactions.\nNote that experimental philosophy, even when viewed in this\npositive light, is at most an addition to our philosophical armoury,\nnot a new way of doing philosophy. For once we have sorted out the\nintuitive principles behind our philosophical judgements, whether by\narmchair reflection or empirical surveys, we still need to assess\ntheir worth.  Even if the claim that we think a certain way is\nsupported by hard empirical data, this doesn\u2019t make that way\nof thinking correct.  That can only be shown by subjecting that way\nof thinking itself to proper a posteriori evaluation.\n",
