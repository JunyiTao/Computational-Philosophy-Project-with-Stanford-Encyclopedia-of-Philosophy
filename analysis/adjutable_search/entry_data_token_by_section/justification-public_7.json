    "main_text": "The Public Justification Principle || Modalities of Public Justification\n2.6 Modalities of Public Justification\n\nThe PJP can also specify which social processes establish public\njustification. We can sort social processes into four types:\ndiscursive, universalizing, bargaining, and evolutionary. Discursive\nviews identify public justification with an agreement reached between\npublic discussants. Universalizing approaches identify public\njustification with fair and reciprocal principles. Bargaining\napproaches identify publicly justified principles as those that\nmaximally advance individual interests. Evolutionary approaches are\nthe most distinctive. They distinguish sharply between public reason\nand public justification. In their view, a coercive principle \\(L\\) is\npublicly justified when it is a stable, evolved public equilibrium. No\nprocess of public reasoning needs to take place. These four theories\neach have a prominent representative. In order they are J\u00fcrgen\nHabermas, John Rawls, David Gauthier and Gerald Gaus.\n2.6.1 Discursive\n\nDiscursive theories understand public justification as generating\nagreement among disputants through a process of real discourse under\njust and fair social institutions. Such views divide into Habermasian\nand pragmatist theories (Talisse 2005; Misak 2000). We can outline the\ndiscursive view by reviewing Habermas\u2019s account (see the entry\non\n J\u00fcrgen Habermas).\n\nHabermas holds (1999, 68) that \u201cthe justification of norms and\ncommands requires that a real discourse be carried out.\u201d The\nonly way to achieve public justification is through free\nargumentation. Such argumentation convinces citizens to recognize the\nclaims others make on them. For \\(A\\) to make a legitimate claim on\n\\(B\\), \\(A\\) must submit his claim to \\(B\\)\u2019s critique. The\ndiscursive process forms each individual\u2019s conception of her\ninterests and commitments. Habermas calls this process \u201cwill\nformation.\u201d Personal opinions can change and then produce a\nrational consensus. Habermas idealizes in this way to define a\nconception of the reasonable. Citizens take a discursive, moral point\nof view. Their goal is to reach a rational consensus about the\ninterests of the public. (For details about how idealized discourse\nproceeds, see Habermas 1999, 65\u20136.)\n2.6.2 Universalizing\n\nUniversalizing views try to identify a regime that fairly advances\neveryone\u2019s interests in accord with how individuals understand\nthose interests. Rawls exemplifies this view: a theory of justice\njustifies claims that citizens make on one another\u2019s conduct\nfrom our perspectives. Given how much people disagree, Rawls knows\nthat gaining traction on justification is complex, and he responds by\nconverting it into a problem of social choice. Rawls: \u201cthe\nquestion of justification [can be] settled by working out a problem of\ndeliberation\u201d (Rawls 1971, 16). Principles of justice are\npublicly justified when parties to a proper choice situation select\nthem.\n2.6.3 Bargaining\n\nBargaining views call a regime legitimate for an individual when it\nmaximally advances her interests. Bargaining suggests a negotiation\nthat yields a stable equilibrium of opposing forces: each person\nachieves as much as she can, consistent with the needs of others. The\nmost prominent example of a bargaining theory is David\nGauthier\u2019s contractarianism. Gauthier argues that citizens need\na social morality to secure social cooperation. We identify moral and\npolitical norms as justified when it is instrumentally rational for\neach agent to accept them.\n\nIndividuals \u201cfaced with the costs of natural or market\ninteraction in the face of externalities agree to a different,\ncooperative mode of interaction.\u201d Rational individuals do so to\n\u201cmaximize their own utility\u201d (Gauthier 1986, 145\u20136).\nThe goal is to show why anyone should accept moral restraints on their\nbehavior. Gauthier proposes that even instrumental rationality can\njustify ethical constraints to all. A citizen can be subject to state\ncoercion in certain respects because it is in his interests. Gauthier\ndoes not base public justification on the total utility it produces.\nParties strike bargains where each person provides the minimum\nrelative concession of rents. Publicly justified rules maximize each\nperson\u2019s share, but joint maximization constrains each\nperson\u2019s claim. Each side seeks the best bargain they can\nget.\n\nIn recent years, both Michael Moehler (2018) and Peter Vanderschraaf\n(2018) have revived bargaining approaches to public justification.\nMoehler develops a \u201ctwo level\u201d theory of practical\nrationality for social contract theory. Bargaining reasoning is the\nfallback position when more moralized contracting fails.\nVanderschraaf\u2019s book, Strategic Justice, takes the\nbargaining approach to its highest level of sophistication.\n2.6.4 Evolutionary\n\nEvolutionary views are, again, the newest approach. The approach\narguably originates in Bryan Skyrms (1996). But Gerald Gaus (2011) is\ntoday the most well-known proponent of such a view. Evolutionary views\nare new because they react to perceived failures of other approaches.\nGaus, for instance, rejects bargaining views, claiming that parties to\npublic justification must be intrinsic rule-followers. We can follow\nrules that frustrate our goals. Gaus argues that agents who follow\nmoral rules for instrumental reasons cannot sustain cooperation\nbecause its members still have reason to defect when others cooperate.\nMoral agency, he concludes, must allow us to decline to maximize the\nsatisfaction of our goals.\n\nFor Gaus, then, parties will not accept every instrumentally rational\nbargain. They also know that public discourse will not resolve their\ndisagreements. And a universalizing approach will yield multiple\neligible social arrangements; universalizing strategies are\nindeterminate. Gaus appeals to social evolution to produce convergence\non an eligible understanding, which would otherwise be indeterminate.\nWhen society reaches an undefeated agreement, it achieves public\njustification. Each party sees no other way to secure social\ncooperation. Public reason combines with a sociological thesis:\nspontaneous order processes can converge on norms. No one foresees or\nconstructs the justified principle or rule. But all have reason to\naccept the outcome of such a process.\n\nEvolutionary views draw on \u201cadaptive\u201d rationality,\ncontrasted with \u201ccalculated\u201d rationality (March 1978). An\nagent is rational when she adapts effectively to her environment, so\nher rationality does not depend on how she adapts, only that she\nadapts well. Calculated rationality occurs when one adapts through\ndeliberative decision-making. Many theorists assume the PJP is a\nprinciple of calculative reason. But evolutionary theorists reject\nthis claim. \\(L\\) is publicly justified for \\(P\\) if each member has\nsufficient reason to endorse \\(L\\). Full stop. Public justification\nobtains even if justificatory reasons differ. It even obtains when\nthese reasons are the consequence of an equilibrium process. The\nreasons need not derive from explicit deliberation.\n\nGaus continued the evolutionary project up to The Open Society and\nIts Complexities (Gaus 2021). The book draws complexity economics\nand agent-based modeling to determine when and in what circumstances a\ndiverse population will converge on common rules. Here Gaus draws on\nRyan Muldoon (2019), who introduced agent-based modeling into social\ncontract theory. Muldoon uses his theory to challenge consensus views\nof public reason.\n",
