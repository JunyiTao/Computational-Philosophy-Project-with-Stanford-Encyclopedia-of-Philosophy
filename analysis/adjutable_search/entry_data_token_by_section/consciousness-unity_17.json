    "main_text": "Theories of Unity || The Experiential Parts Theory\n7.1 The Experiential Parts Theory\n\nHow is unified conscious experience structured? As we mentioned in\n Section 2.1,\n two incompatible models have some currency at the moment. On the\nexperiential parts view (EP), unified conscious experience includes\nsimpler experiences as parts or something like parts; unified\nconsciousness has a mereological aspect. On this view, when I have a\nunified experience of a pain and a noise, this unified experience\nincludes an experience of just the pain, and an experience of just the\nnoise. These simpler experiences are the relata of unified\nconsciousness; they are joined as parts of the unified experience of\nthe pain and noise together. Experiences a and b are\nunited in a third experience, c, which is their joint\noccurrence. On the no experiential parts (NEP) account, the conscious\nmental act through which diverse contents are presented does not have\nother conscious states, experiences, as parts. On the first view, when\nI have unified consciousness of experiencing, I am conscious of many\nexperiences. On the second view, I am conscious of just one\nexperience.\n\nTo clarify the two, let us use the notation \u2018\\(E(o_1)\\)\u2019\nfor an experience that is the conscious experience of just the\nintentional object \\(o_{1}\\). A conscious experience of just \\(o_{2}\\)\nis \\(E(o_{2})\\). What is the nature of an experience that takes the\nbigger content in which \\(o_{1}\\) and \\(o_{2}\\) are presented\ntogether? On NEP, it has the structure of \\(E(o_{1}, o_{2})\\), where\nthis introduces a single experience that has both contents as its\nobject. To be conscious of \\(o_{1}\\) by means of this experience is to\nbe conscious of it with \\(o_{2}\\). (See the concept of joint\nconsciousness introduced in\n Section 2.1.3.)\n According to NEP, this is what the subject\u2019s conscious unity at\nthe time amounts to (if we oversimplify by supposing her to be\nconscious of nothing but \\(o_{1}\\) and \\(o_{2}\\)). No\n\u2018smaller\u2019 or simpler conscious states figure as parts.\nThis experience might be realized in a brain state that has parts, but\nthese parts are not further conscious states. By contrast, in EP\n\\(E(o_{1})\\) and \\(E(o_{2})\\) persist as parts of an encompassing\nexperience by means of which one is conscious of \\(o_{1}\\) and\n\\(o_{2}\\) together and unified consciousness would have the structure\n\\(E(E(o_{1}) E(o_{2}))\\). \n\nProponents of EP include Lockwood, Dainton, Shoemaker, and Bayne and\nChalmers, and Bayne by himself (in his 2010 book). As we saw in\n Section 2.2,\n theorists as otherwise different as Dainton, Lockwood, and Shoemaker\nuse the term \u2018co-consciousness\u2019 as the name for the\nrelationship that ties the experiential parts together. Not only are\nmost versions of EP built on some notion of co-consciousness; most\nnotions of co-consciousness assume EP and are incompatible with NEP.\n\n\nEP faces a difficulty. James describes the problem in his example of\nthe twelve-word sentence. Suppose each word in the sentence is known\nby just one of twelve people. It is hard to see, James says, how these\ntwelve thoughts could be combined to yield a unified consciousness of\nthe sentence. As he says,\n\n\nTake a sentence of a dozen words, take twelve men, and to each one\nword. Then stand the men in a row or jam them in a bunch, and let each\nthink of his word as intently as he will; nowhere will there be a\nconsciousness of the whole sentence. (James 1890: 160) \n\n\nWhat EP needs is a way of combining experiences that does not simply\nconjoin them into an experiential aggregate, for a mere combination of\nexperiences is not the experience of a combination. EP needs, then, a\nway of putting together experiences that also puts together their\ncontents. Without any specification of how this combining of contents\nis to be achieved, we are left with a mere aggregate of experiences,\neach member of which is oblivious to the contents of the other states\nin the aggregate. As James puts it, \u201cIdea of a + idea of\nb is not identical with idea of (\\(a + b\\))\u201d (1890:\n161).\n\nProponents of EP may reply that they never intended to give an\naccount of conscious unity. Instead, EP should be taken to\nprovide a description of the structure of unified conscious\nstates. In other words, it is a characterization, not an explanation,\nof such states and how they are individuated. It may be held that the\nonly good way to individuate conscious states is on the basis of\ncontents. Hence, since one is aware of many contents via a conscious\nstate, that state must itself consist of several simpler conscious\nstates that have (somehow) come to be unified. At the very least,\nthen, those who advocate NEP owe us an alternative basis for\nindividuating conscious states. We will return to this issue in the\nnext section.\n\nAs we saw, the notion of a unified experience subsuming simpler\nexperiences is central to Bayne\u2019s and Chalmers\u2019 (2003; see\nBayne 2010) account of the unity of consciousness. This may appear to\nbe a version of EP and Tye treats it so (without using that label;\n2003: 21). However, Bayne and Chalmers hedge their bet. While they do\nspeak of the encompassing conscious state as involving \u201cat least\na conjunction of each of many more specific conscious states\u201d\n(2003: 27), and of a \u201ccomplex phenomenal state and a simpler\nstate that is intuitively one of its \u2018components\u2019\u201d\n(2003: 40), they also caution that thinking here in terms of \u201ca\nmereological part/whole relation among phenomenal states\u201d should\nbe regarded only as an \u201caid to intuition rather than as a\nserious ontological proposal\u201d (2003: 40). So how their view\nstacks up with respect to EP is not entirely clear. \n",
