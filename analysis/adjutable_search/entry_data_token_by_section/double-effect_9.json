The judgment that the Terror Bomber acts\nimpermissibly and the Tactical Bomber acts permissibly is widely\naffirmed. Terror bombing was engaged in by both sides in World War II\n(see Douglas Lackey (1989) for a thoughtful historical account of the\ndecision process engaged in by Allied decision-makers and the\ncontroversy it generated at the time). The view that terror bombing is\nalways impermissible would condemn the kind of incendiary bombing\ncarried out by Allied forces in Germany and Japan.\n\nThe common judgment that tactical bombing is permissible provided that\nit is proportionate also deserves more scrutiny than it usually\nreceives when it is taken to be justified by the principle of double\neffect. How much of an obligation do military strategists have to\navoid harm to civilian populations? This is a substantive issue about\nthe conventions that constrain military decision-making and the\nprinciples that underlie these conventions. Many relevant\nconsiderations depend on judgments that are far outside the ambit of\nDouble Effect. For example, the Rules of Customary International\nHumanitarian Law displayed on the website of the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross prohibit attacks targeting civilians. They\nalso include protections designed to minimize harm to civilians:\n\n\nRule 15. Precautions in Attack In the conduct of military\noperations, constant care must be taken to spare the civilian\npopulation, civilians and civilian objects. All feasible precautions\nmust be taken to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss\nof civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian\nobjects.\n\nRule 20. Advance Warning Each party to the conflict must give\neffective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian\npopulation, unless circumstances do not permit.\n\nRule 24. Removal of Civilians and Civilian Objects from the\nVicinity of Military Objectives Each party to the conflict must,\nto the extent feasible, remove civilian persons and objects under its\ncontrol from the vicinity of military objectives.\n\n\nThese considerations suggest that the principle of double effect does\nnot contain, even when the principle of proportionality is included as\npart of its content, a sufficient condition of permissibility for\nbombardment that affects civilian populations. The example so\nfrequently invoked by philosophers concerning the permissibility of\ntactical bombing in which civilian deaths are foreseen never mentions\na duty to warn or remove civilians.\n",
