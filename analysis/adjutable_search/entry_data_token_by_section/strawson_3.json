    "main_text": "Logical Theory\n4. Logical Theory\n\nStrawson published his first book An Introduction to Logical\nTheory in 1952. In it he attempts to explain the nature, and the\nscope and limits, of formal logic. The eminence he had already\nachieved was reflected in the fact that it received a review by Quine\nin Mind. Strawson\u2019s aim, generated in part by his\nreflections on the correct treatment of definite descriptions, is to\nsay what formal logic is by explaining and elucidating its central\nconcepts, among them the notion of entailment. Strawson favours\nexplaining \u2018P entails Q\u2019 as\n\u2018\u2018P and not Q\u2019 is\nself-contradictory\u2019, and explains or elucidates the notion of\nself-contradiction in terms of sentences saying nothing; in effect,\nthey give and then take back simultaneously. Strawson then looks at\nthe notion of form and of proof systems. He applies his ideas to\ntraditional syllogistic logic as well as to modern propositional and\npredicate logic. It can be wondered how far his elucidation of the\ncentral notions is adequate, and it can also be wondered whether he\nattends to all the notions that need explanation in relation to formal\nlogic (e.g., consistency and completeness). The main part of his book\ndoes not seem to have had a large influence on philosophers or\nlogicians. However, three elements in his discussion had and continue\nto have considerable influence. First, he gave a fuller explanation of\nthe notion of presupposition than he had previously provided. Second,\nStrawson asked how far the meaning of ordinary language connectives,\nsuch as \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019 and \u2018if \u2026\nthen\u2026\u2019, can be equated with those of the truth functional\nconnectives, such as \u2018&\u2019, \u2018\u2228\u2019, and\n\u2018\u2192\u2019, that logicians employ. Strawson argued that\nthere are significant differences. His conclusion is that these\nordinary expressions do not have what might be called a precise logic.\nThe question that Strawson asked has continued to be central in the\nphilosophy of language and has not been resolved. Grice took an\nopposite view to Strawson and part of the point of Grice\u2019s\naccount of implication, as opposed to meaning or saying, was to\ngenerate an explanation for the data that Strawson appealed to in\narguing for a semantic difference between ordinary language and formal\nlogic, without having to postulate a semantic difference. Strawson\nhimself later criticised Grice\u2019s theory, at least in relation to\nconditionals. Third, he proposed an approach to the problem of\ninduction. We shall describe that later when looking at\nStrawson\u2019s contribution to epistemology.\n",
