The first one\n(previously known as the \u2018Vatican commentary\u2019) was\nascribed to Brito by Costa after a suggestion by Ren\u00e9-Antoine\nGauthier (QEN; QE-2008: 99\u2013137). The second\nset of questions, preserved in a sole manuscript, Vat. Lat. 2173, is\nstill unedited. The first one was written around 1295, when Brito was\na master of arts, and the second some years later, most likely when he\nwas studying theology.\n",
