    "main_text": "Characteristics of Analytic Feminism || Reconstructing Philosophy\n4.4 Reconstructing Philosophy\n\nWe noted in the\n second section\n that feminist philosophers with a variety of methodological and\npolitical backgrounds would agree that if a philosopher\nclaims universal applicability for a theory or method, it must be\nusable by people of any gender from a variety of complex social\nlocations. Many analytic feminists use a similar approach to the\nconstruction of feminist philosophy. They tend to be wary of\ncreating specialized fields/types of philosophy that are relevant only\nto (some or all) women or feminists, for example, ethics or\nepistemology that is only for lesbians or is\n\u201cgynocentric\u201d. Analytic feminists tend to propose that\nfeminist ethics or feminist metaphysics would instead establish new\ncriteria of adequacy for ethics or metaphysics. The authors\nin The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy provide\nexcellent examples of this approach (Fricker & Hornsby 2000). This\napproach can be spelled out in terms similar to some used in\n Section 2:\n An adequate philosophical theory, method or concept is one that\n\u201cworks\u201d for women as well as everyone else.\n\u201cWorks\u201d is very inclusive here: it cannot be enmeshed in a\nphilosophical system that has oppressive consequences large or small;\nits theories and concepts must reflect and be applicable to the full\nrange of experiences, interests, and situations of all sorts of women,\nmen, and nonbinary people. Note that this view requires no commitment\nto claims about feminist standpoints, nor does it treat women as a\nuniform class of any kind. It is obvious that experiences vary\naccording to a number of different axes\u2014not only along the\ncommonly cited axes of social class, sexual orientation,\nrace/ethnicity, physical or mental abilities, and gender\u2014but\nalso in terms of individual variation as well as other general\nfactors. This approach leaves open many substantive questions about\nthe long-term interests of different individuals and groups. It also\npermits one to point out the importance of having a variety of\nperspectives without maintaining that there is something\n\u201cessential\u201d about these perspectives.\n\nAs analytic feminism has become an increasingly developed field, its\npractitioners have expanded the range of resources upon which they\ndraw as they reconstruct philosophy. Some analytic feminists alongside\nothers pursuing engaged scholarship, have argued that traditional\nphilosophy and feminist philosophy alike need to reflect the\ncomplexities of intersectional analyses of gender, race/ethnicity,\nsexuality, disability, class, and so on (Bailey 2010 and Garry 2012\ntook particular aim at analytic feminists in their arguments for\nintersectionality). Philosophers need to draw on feminist critical\nrace theory, critical disability studies, and queer and trans theory\nto enrich their understanding of the ways in which various axes of\noppression and privilege intermesh.\n\nReconstructing philosophy also requires understanding the roles that\nprivilege and oppression play in the widespread construction of\nepistemic ignorance and in practices that result in epistemic\ninjustice and epistemic oppression. A rapidly growing body of\nliterature in the twenty-first century, for example, Miranda Fricker\n(2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011, 2014) as well as multiple authors in\nNancy Tuana and Shannon Sullivan (2006),in Sullivan and Tuana (2007),\nand in Ian Kidd, Jos\u00e9 Medina, and Gaile Pohlhaus (2017) call to\nour attention both the depth with which privilege has been constructed\nand the ways its tentacles reach into multiple facets of our epistemic\nand moral\n lives.[8]See\n entry on\n feminist social epistemology\n for more detailed discussion.\n",
