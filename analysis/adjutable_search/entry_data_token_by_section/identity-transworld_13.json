    "main_text": "Individual essences and bare identities || Leibniz and hyper-essentialism\n4.5 Leibniz and hyper-essentialism\n\nFinally, it can be noted that the problems concerning transworld\nidentity discussed here arise only because it is assumed that not all\nof an individual\u2019s properties are essential to it (and hence\nthat, if it exists in more than one possible world, it has different\nproperties in different worlds). If, instead, one were to hold that\nall of an individual\u2019s properties are essential\nproperties\u2014and hence, for example, that George Eliot could not\nhave existed with properties in any way different from her actual\nones\u2014then no such problems would arise. Moreover, this\nsuggestion, implausible though it may be, is of some historical\ninterest. For, according to a standard interpretation of the views of\nGottfried Leibniz, the philosopher who is the father of theories of\npossible worlds, Leibniz\u2019s theory of \u2018complete individual\nnotions\u2019 commits him to the thesis that an individual such as\nGeorge Eliot does have all her properties essentially (cf.\nLeibniz, Discourse on Metaphysics (1687), Sections 8 and 13;\nprinted in Leibniz 1973 and elsewhere). According to the\n\u2018hyper-essentialist\u2019 view to which Leibniz appears to be\ncommitted, any individual, in any possible world, whose properties in\nthat world differ from the actual properties of George Eliot is not,\nstrictly speaking, identical with Eliot. However, it also seems clear\nthat this does not represent a way of saving a transworld identity\ninterpretation of de re modality. On the contrary: if there\nis no possible world in which George Eliot exists with properties\ndifferent from her actual properties, then it is plausible to conclude\nthat there is no possible world, other than the actual world, in which\nshe exists at all. For unless possible worlds can be exact duplicates\n(something that Leibniz himself would deny), any merely possible world\nmust differ from the actual world in some respect. If so, then the\nproperties of any individual in another possible world must differ in\nsome respect from the actual properties of Eliot (even if the\ndifference is only a difference in relational properties), in which\ncase, if all Eliot\u2019s properties are essential to her, that\nindividual is not Eliot. (Leibniz\u2019s views may, however, be seen\nas a partial anticipation of counterpart theory, which attempts to\nsave the truth of the claim that George Eliot could have been\ndifferent in some respects (thus denying\n\u2018hyper-essentialism\u2019) while preserving the metaphysical\nthesis that no individual who is, strictly speaking, identical with\nEliot exists in any other possible world (cf. Kripke 1980, 45, note\n13).)\n",
