Very briefly, the term\n\u2018ground\u2019 is used to articulate dependence claims, without\ncommitment to specific modal or counterfactual interpretations of\nvarious sorts of metaphysical dependence. Let us first provide some\nbackground and then hint at possible connections between reduction and\nground.\n5.3.1 A very short introduction to ground\n\nFollowing Schaffer (2009), one can draw a distinction between two\ntypes of metaphysics in terms of their alleged subject matter.\nQuinean metaphysics deals with existence questions. It asks:\nWhat exists? What is part of the ontology of a given theory, such as\nphysics? In contrast, (Neo-)Aristotelian metaphysics is\npermissive regarding existence. It is mainly concerned to identify\nwhat is fundamental and what depends on the fundamental. In\nSchaffer\u2019s terms, it is concerned with \u201cwhat grounds\nwhat\u201d (Schaffer 2009). Examples of dependence claims the\nNeo-Aristotelian is concerned with include:\n\nThe particularized property depends in its bearer.\nThe mental depends on the physical.\nAesthetic properties depend on physical properties and\nattitudes.\nMechanisms depend on their constituents and these\nconstituents\u2019 interactions. \nThe whole depends on its parts. \nSets depend on their elements.\nThe hole in the Swiss cheese depends on the cheese. \n\n\nAt least some of these claims, or cognates thereof, have formed part\nof metaphysics carried out in the Quinean spirit. Until recently,\nhowever, metaphysics did not provide the means to address these claims\nproperly, says the defender of ground. Consider the claim that the\nmental depends on the physical. Until recently,\nmetaphysicians would have suggested that this claim is to be cashed\nout in modal or counterfactual terms. The claim could be given an\ninterpretation in terms of supervenience: Any shift in mental\nproperties necessitates a shift at the level of physical properties.\n\n\nAny analysis along these lines will leave the grounding theorist\ndissatisfied. One reson to be skeptical about an analysis of\ndependence in terms of supervenience is that supervenience is neither\nirreflexive nor asymmetric (unless by way of\nstipulation). In contrast, the sort of dependence grounding theorists\nare after when claiming that the mental depends on the physical\nrequires that the physical does not depend on the mental, neither in\nwhole nor in part. Unlike supervenience, dependence, at least of the\nsort assumed in the grounding literature, is asymmetric and\nirreflexive. And dependence claims may concern necessarily\n(co-)existing entities; dependence, unlike supervenience, appears to\ngenerate hyper-intensional contexts, i.e. contexts in which even\nsubstitution of necessary equivalents is not guarantee to preserve\ntruth value (for further discussion, see Schaffer 2009, 364). \n\nThe concept of ground is supposed to do the trick. Ground is\nregarded as a primitive (Fine 2001). As a consequence, instead of\ngiving an analysis of the concept of ground, philosophers have studied\nthe structural features of ground \u2013 it is transitive,\nirreflexive, asymmetric, and it generates hyper-intensional contexts\n(Fine 2012; see also the contributions in Correia and Schnieder 2012).\nBut if this notion is primitive, how do we get access to it? After\nall, \u2018ground\u2019 is, like \u2018reduction\u2019, a\nphilosophical term; reflection on ordinary usage will not give access\nto its meaning in philosophical contexts.\n\nOne influential idea is that explanatory connectives such as\n\u2018because\u2019 or \u2018in virtue of\u2019 introduce a basic\nnotion of ground (Fine 2012). \u2018Because\u2019 and \u2018in\nvirtue of\u2019 are arguably asymmetric and irreflexive, and they\ngenerate hyper-intensional contexts (Schnieder 2011). They are part of\nordinary discourse, and we are competent in using these expressions.\nWhen taken in a non-causal sense, or in a context where these\nconnectives do not track causal dependencies, they may give access to\nthe sort of metaphysical dependence philosophers have sought to\ncapture for decades, if not centuries. \n\nAlternatively, one could give an ostensive definition and introduce\nthe notion of ground by way of examples; reflection on lists of\ndependence claims, or pairs of objects that are supposed to\ninstantiate the grounding relation, may give access to the notion of\nground (Schaffer 2009). \n\nThere are different interpretations of ground \u2013 in particular\nwith respect to what can bel labeled \u2018relational\u2019\ngrounding and \u2018operational\u2019 grounding (Tahko 2013).\nMoreover, philosophers who accept a relational interpretation disagree\nabout the primary relata of ground (candidates include:\nfacts, propositions, properties etc). \n\nSumming up: The primitive notion of ground is supposed to do justice\nto dependence claims, without any aspiration to further reduce this\nconcept to modal or counterfactual concepts; and it has been suggested\nthat explanatory connectives express this notion of ground. These\npreliminary remarks in mind, let us now turn to possible connections\nbetween redutcion and ground. First, there are two very general\nreasons to regard reduction as a particular variant of ground (5.3.2).\nAt the same time, there appears to be a tension between reduction and\nground. Either, reduction turns out to be distinct from ground, or the\nstructural features of reduction may shed light on the nature of\nground (5.2.3). Third, one may want to resist an assimilation of\nreduction to ground, based on a general skepticism towards the\nphilosophical significance of grounding talk (5.2.4). \n5.3.2 Reduction and ground linked\n\nThere are two paths leading from reduction to ground. First, reductive\ninterpretations of paradigmatic dependence claims may inspire a\nreconstruction of reduction in terms of ground. Reductionists about\nthe mental argue that mental states, like pain, reduce to certain\nphysiological states and are, hence, identical to the latter.\nEliminativists argue that mental states or properties just do not\nexist. Anti-reductionists maintain that pains exist and are different\nfrom corresponding physiological states. Some naturalists employ\nvarious notions of dependence to capture the priority of the natural\nwhile acknowledging a plurality of layers of reality. The debate thus\ncentered on questions of existence and, often, various\ndependence relations, ranging from emergence to ruthless\nreduction. It appears, then, that the reductionist about the mental\nmaintains that the mental reductively depends on the\nphysiological. \n\nBy these lights, it may seem plausible to reconstruct reduction claims\nin terms of ground (if we accept that grounding talk is fruitful).\nAbove, we have noted that the primitive concept of ground may be\nintroduced by way of examples, or by lists of paradigmatic dependence\nclaims. Theories of reduction may offer a viable interpretation of at\nleast some of these dependence claims. Hence, it should not come as a\nsurprise that some maintain that redution is sufficient for ground, so\nthat if a reduces to b, then b grounds\na (Rosen 2010, 124f., Schaffer 2009, 378, van Riel 2014). In\na similar spirit, one may suggest that grounding talk offers a\nfruitful reconstruction of the idea that some things do not exist\nover and above other things, an idea frequently invoked in the\nreductio debate (cf. Wilson 2014 for an extensive discussion). It\nseems that on this conception, reduction turns out to be a particular\nvariant of grund, perhaps among others.\n Second, conceptions of reduction in the philosophy of science,\nwhich draw on explanatory notions, are committed to the assumption\nthat there is a tight connection between reduction and ground,\nconditional on the assumption that explanatory vocabulary (interpreted\nnon-causally) does in fact introduce a notion of ground, as some\ngrounding theorists would have it. A concept of ground is often\nintroduced by reference to explanatory connectives, such as\n\u2018because\u2019, and \u2018in virtue of\u2019. On this\ninterpretation, there is a close link to conceptions of reduction in\nthe philosophy of science. Within this strand of the reduction debate,\nreduction has been conceived of as an explanatory connection (see\nabove). Of course, a robust metaphysical interpretation of explanatory\nlinks in terms of ground stands in stark contrast to some standard\nconceptions of explanation within the philosophy of science.  Realists\nhave mainly focused on causal explanation (Salmon 1989); only\nrecently, philosophers of science have turned to non-causal,\nmechanistic dependence (cf. Machamer et al. 2000, Craver 2005,\n2007). Others have taken explanation to be primarily an epistemic or\npragmatic affair (Kitcher 1989, Achinstein 1983, van Fraassen\n1980). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that it is an open question\nwhether (non-causal) explanation can be construed pragmatically or\nepistemically, or whether it requires a metaphysically robust\ninterpretation. If it turns out that explanation does require a\nmetaphysically robust interpretation, the fact that reduction has been\nconstrued as an explanatory notion in the philosophy of science may be\nseen as an indicator that claims of reduction are, properly construed,\nclaims of ground.\n5.3.3 A possible problem\n\nYet, there is a problem. Above, it has been pointed out that claims of\nreduction are often taken to imply corresponding identity claims.\nRecall Identity Reduction (4.5.1): \n\n\nIdentity reduction:\nP1 reduces to P2 only if\nP1 = P2.\n\n\nAs a consequence, reduction is taken to have the \u201cstructural\nfeatures of identity\u201d, such as reflexivity and symmetry, as\nTrogdon maintains (Trogdon 2013, similarly: Audi 2012), but also\nintensionality. Then, it is not clear how reduction could possibly\nexhibit the structural features of ground \u2013 irreflexivity,\nasymmetry, and hyper-intensionality. (This observation seems to\nparallel the tension between supervenience and dependence noted\nabove.) Philosophers have reacted in different ways. Some take these\nobservations at face value and conclude that reduction is distinct\nfrom ground (Audi 2012, Trogdon 2013). Others have argued that it\nwould be short-sighted to construe reduction in this way. From\nIdentity Reduction, it simply does not follow that reduction\nhas the structural features of identity. Recall the puzzle of\nreduction discussed above: Although reduction requires identity,\nidentity is not sufficient for reduction. In fact, if a\nreduces to b, it follows, by the asymmetry of reduction, that\nb does not reduce to a. For this and similary\nreasons, it has been suggested that reduction generates\nhyper-intensional contexts, and that reduction statements are\nsensitive to the modes of presentation expressed by the terms flanking\nthe reduction predicate (Jenkins 2011, van Riel 2013, 2014). On this\nview, reduction may turn out to be a variant of ground.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this debate turns on fundamental questions\nregarding the nature of ground. If reduction is a variant of ground,\nand if \u2018reduces to\u2019 generates hyper-intensional contexts\nin the way just sketched, then ground does not link\nnon-representational objects only. Put differently, the grounding\nstructure of the world would then depend, at least in part, on\nfeatures of representations of the world. Fine (2001, 2012)\nand DasGupta (2014) take ground to be concerned with truths or finely\nindividuated facts, rather than properties or fundamental or composed\nobjects. On the other hand, this observation has led some philosophers\nto assume that reduction, ontologically construed, should not be\nregarded as a version of metaphysical ground (Audi 2012). \n5.3.4 Reduction without grounding\n\nOf course, there may be very general reasons to reject grounding talk\naltogether (see the discussion in the entry Metaphysical Grounding).\nIn the present context, one criticism deserves close attention. Wilson\n(2014) maintains that reference to a primitive metaphysical relation\nin articulations of various dependence claims does not constitute\nphilosophical progress. Many of the various detailed explications of\ndifferent types of dependence, including mereological dependence,\nsupervenience, and the relation between determinables and\ndeterminates, promise illumination, whereas grounding talk is\nultimately obscure, mainly for two reasons. First,\n\u2018ground\u2019 is supposed to be primitive. Second, its\nstructural features of a partial order \u2013 ground is irreflexive,\nasymmetric and transitive \u2013 are too permissive and too narrow at\nthe same time, to single out a particular relation of metaphysical\ndependence, says Wilson. It is too permissive because temporal order\nand causation may have the same structural features (Wilson 2014,\n569). It may be too narrow because, for instance, mixed cases of\ndependence may violate transitivity (Schaffer 2012, Wilson 2014). So,\neven if there is prima facie evidence that reduction and ground are\nclosely linked, it is an open question whether shifting attention from\ntheories of reduction to the metaphysics of ground will prove\nfruitful. \n5.4 Problems for reductionism and the relevance of the notion of reduction\n\nScientific reduction became an important topic in the philosophy of\nscience within the context of a general interest in the unity of\nscience, and it was inspired by specific alleged cases of successful\nreductions. The most prominent argument against reductionism stems\nfrom the observation that straightforward reductions hardly ever\noccur. Hence, reductionism cannot be regarded as yielding a coherent\npicture of what actually goes on in science. As long as reductionism\nis supposed to be more than a purely metaphysical position and is\nintended to say something significant about scientific change or\nnorms, the value and relevance of the notion of reduction seems to\ndepend in part upon how well the reductionist positions fit the facts,\nwhich their critics argue they do not (see, for example, Sarkar 1992;\nScerri & McIntyre 1997).\n\nProponents of reduction have responded in different ways. Some have\nsuggested more flexible and liberal interpretations of reduction\n(Wimsatt 1976; Schaffner 1993; Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010), to ensure\nthat the term \u2018reduction\u2019 still serves a purpose in\ndescribing actual scientific practice. A case in point is\nSchaffner\u2019s suggestion (Schaffner 2006&2012) that we should\nreconsider the relevance of merely partial reductions or of scientific\nexplanations, broadly construed, that are reductionist in spirit,\ndespite the fact that they do not comply with more traditional\nstandards of full-fledged theory-reductions (see also Winther\n2009).\n\nOthers have opted for a more radical stance: Bickle has recently\nsuggested that philosophical theorizing about reduction should best be\nconstrued as reconstructing whatever cases scientists judge to be\nreductions (Bickle 2008).\n\nA much more modest position consists in the idea that, though\nstraightforward reductions might be rare, reductionism might play a\nrole as a regulative ideal (Schaffner 1993); the notion of reduction\ncan, on this view, be used to characterize one extreme of a spectrum\nof possible relations between different stages of scientific\ndevelopments. It comes with a specific normative power: If a reduction\ncan be effected, it should be effected.\n\nIn addition, the notion of reduction obviously plays an important role\nin the characterization of non-reductive physicalism; a careful\ninvestigation of what reductionism consists in is required to\nadequately determine in what respects, if any, a theory of mind could\nbe coherently both non-reductivist and materialist about the\nmental.\n\nFinally, the concept obviously plays an important role in the field of\nmetaphysics which often extends far into the realm of possibilities.\nEven if reductionism should fail to apply to our world and our\nscientific history, it might be of interest to consider what reality\nwould be like in other worlds where reductionism does hold, worlds\nsimilar to ours in containing many different theories or conceptual\nframeworks but ones tied together by reductive links.\n\nThe hope that the actual progress of science can be successfully\ndescribed in terms of reduction has vanished. Concepts of reduction,\nexcept for those re-adapted to actual scientific practice, are\nnowadays studied primarily in the more theoretically oriented parts of\nthe metaphysics of science.\n\nStill, the question of what the concept of reduction amounts to can be\nsatisfactorily answered even if no theory actually reduces to any\nother theory and no property reduces to any other property. Answering\nthis question may serve two closely related purposes. First, a precise\ncharacterization of what reduction is supposed to consist in will help\njudging whether or not a given theory, such as folk psychology, or a\ngiven property, such as being in pain, actually reduce to their neural\ncounterparts. Secondly, an appropriate definition of reduction is\ncalled for when it comes to evaluating anti-reductionist\npositions.\n\nAs we have seen, reduction has been conceived of as a relation that\nprimarily holds between theories, properties, substances, concepts, or\nevents. It has been described as an explanatory relation that can be\ncashed out in terms of derivation, and it could be tied to mechanistic\nor ontological dependence, supervenience and identity. It has been\nargued that theory-reduction is prior to ontological reduction; and it\nhas been argued that ontological reduction is more fundamental than\ntheory reduction. Reduction has been couched in structuralist,\nempiricist and functionalist frameworks, and it has been one of the\ncore notions of theories defending one form or another of scientific\nunification. Most philosophers have abandoned this latter view. But\neven if the outlook for strong general reductionism, a form of\nreductionism that amounts to scientific as well as ontological unity\nmight be dim, exploring the question of what it takes for a property\nor theory to reduce to another property or theory will help not only\nunderstand what the search for unity consists in, a search that\ndominated large parts of the philosophy of science in the last\ncentury; it will also help judging and understanding its rivals, such\nas non-reductive physicalism, versions of dualism, or even the\nrecently defended rainforest pluralism (Wimsatt 1994). If we know the\nconditions imposed by the reduction relation on pairs of theories or\nproperties, we will also know what these anti-reductionist theories\nare bound to deny.",
