    "main_text": "Dreaming and theories of consciousness || Dreams, psychosis, and delusions\n3.2 Dreams, psychosis, and delusions\n\nDreaming has been suggested as a model system not just of waking\nconsciousness in general, but also of psychotic wake states in\nparticular. The analogy between dreaming and madness has a long\nphilosophical history (Plato, Phaedrus; Kant 1766;\nSchopenhauer 1847) and finds particularly stark expression in\nHobson\u2019s claim that \u201cdreaming is not a model of a\npsychosis. It is a psychosis. It\u2019s just a healthy one\u201d\n(Hobson 1999: 44). Gottesmann (2006) proposes dreaming as a\nneurophysiological model of schizophrenia. There is a rich discussion\non the theoretical and methodological implications of dream research\nfor psychiatry (see Scarone et al. 2007; d\u2019Agostino et al. 2013;\nsee Windt & Noreika 2011 as well as the other papers in this\nspecial issue) and a number of studies have investigated differences\nin dream reports from schizophrenic and healthy subjects (Limosani et\nal. 2011a,b).\n\nRather than likening dreaming to waking in general or specific wake\nstates such as psychosis, there have also been attempts to compare\nspecific dream phenomena to wake-state delusions. Gerrans (2012, 2013,\n2014) focuses on character misidentification in dreams and delusions\nof hyperfamiliarity (such as the Fr\u00e9goli delusion, in which\nstrangers are mistakenly identified as family members, and\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) to argue that anomalous experience and\nfaulty reality testing both play a role in delusion formation. Rosen\n(2015) analyzes instances of thought insertion and of auditory\nhallucinations, which are key symptoms of schizophrenia, to raise\nbroader questions about the altered sense of agency in dreams as\ncompared to waking.\n",
