Paradoxes, Puzzles, and Problems of Self-Deception\n\n\u201cWhat is self-deception?\u201d sounds like a straightforward\nquestion, but the more philosophers have sought to answer it, the more\npuzzling it has become. Traditionally, self-deception has been modeled\non interpersonal deception, where A intentionally gets\nB to believe some proposition p, all the while\nknowing or believing truly that ~p. Such deception is\nintentional and requires the deceiver to know or believe that\n~p and the deceived to believe that p. One reason\nfor thinking self-deception is analogous to interpersonal deception of\nthis sort is that it helps us to distinguish self-deception from mere\nerror since the acquisition and maintenance of the false belief are\nintentional, not accidental. It also helps to explain why we think\nself-deceivers are responsible for and open to the evaluation of their\nself-deception. If self-deception is properly modeled on interpersonal\ndeception, self-deceivers intentionally get themselves to believe that\np, all the while knowing or believing truly that ~p.\nOn this traditional model, then, self-deceivers apparently must (1)\nhold contradictory beliefs\u2014the dual-belief requirement\u2014and\n(2) intentionally get themselves to hold a belief they know or believe\ntruly to be false.\n\nThe traditional model of self-deception, however, has been thought to\nraise two paradoxes: One concerns the self-deceiver\u2019s state of\nmind\u2014the so-called static paradox. How can a person\nsimultaneously hold contradictory beliefs? The other concerns the\nprocess or dynamics of self-deception\u2014the so-called\ndynamic or strategic paradox. How can a person\nintend to deceive herself without rendering her intentions\nineffective? (Mele 1987a; 2001)\n\nThe dual-belief requirement raises the static paradox since\nit seems to pose an impossible state of mind, namely, consciously and\nsimultaneously believing that p and ~p. As deceiver,\nshe believes that ~p, and, as deceived, she believes that\np. Accordingly, the self-deceiver consciously believes that\np and ~p. But if believing both a proposition and\nits negation in full awareness is an impossible state of mind,\nself-deception, as it has traditionally been understood, seems\nimpossible as well. Static paradoxes also arise regarding\nmotivation, intention, emotion, and the like insofar as self-deceivers\nseem to harbor psychological states of these kinds that seem deeply\nincompatible (Funkhouser 2019).\n\nThe requirement that the self-deceiver intentionally gets herself to\nhold a belief she knows to be false raises the dynamic or\nstrategic paradox since it seems to involve the self-deceiver\nin an impossible project, namely, both deploying and being duped by\nsome deceitful strategy. As deceiver, she must be aware that\nshe\u2019s deploying a deceitful strategy; but, as deceived, she must\nbe unaware of this strategy for it to be effective. And yet it\u2019s\ndifficult to see how the self-deceiver could fail to be aware of her\nintention to deceive. A strategy known to be deceitful seems bound to\nfail. How could I be taken in by your efforts to get me to believe\nsomething false if I know what you\u2019re up to? But if it\u2019s\nimpossible to be taken in by a strategy one knows is deceitful, then,\nagain, self-deception, as it has traditionally been understood, seems\nto be impossible as well.\n\nThese paradoxes have led a minority of philosophers to be skeptical\nthat self-deception is conceptually possible or even coherent (Paluch\n1967; Haight 1980; Kipp 1980). Borge (2003) contends that accounts of\nself-deception inevitably give up central elements of our\nfolk-psychological notions of \u201cself\u201d or\n\u201cdeception\u201d to avoid paradox, leaving us to wonder whether\nthis framework itself is what gets in the way of explaining the\nphenomenon. Such skepticism toward the concept may seem warranted,\ngiven the obvious paradoxes involved. Most philosophers, however, have\nsought some resolution to these paradoxes instead of giving up on the\nnotion itself, not only because empirical evidence suggests that\nself-deception is not only possible but pervasive (Sahdra and Thagard\n2003) but also because the concept does seem to pick out a distinct\nkind of motivated irrationality.\n\nPhilosophical accounts of self-deception roughly fall into two main\ngroups: those that maintain that the paradigmatic cases of\nself-deception are intentional and those that deny this. Call these\napproaches intentionalist and revisionist,\nrespectively. Intentionalists find the model of intentional\ninterpersonal deception apt since it helps to explain the selectivity\nof self-deception and the apparent responsibility of self-deceivers,\nas well as provide a clear way of distinguishing self-deception from\nother sorts of motivated belief, such as wishful thinking. To avoid\nparadox, these approaches introduce a variety of divisions that shield\nthe deceiving from the deceived mind. Revisionists are skeptical of\nthese divisions and the \u2018psychological exotica\u2019 (Mele\n2001) apparently needed to avoid the static and dynamic paradoxes.\nInstead, they argue that revision of the intention requirement, the\nbelief requirement, or both offers a simpler account of self-deception\nthat avoids the paradoxes raised by modeling it on intentional\ninterpersonal deception.\n",
