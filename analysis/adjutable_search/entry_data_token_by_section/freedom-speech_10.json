    "main_text": "Democracy and Free Speech || Paternalistic Justification for Limiting Speech\n4.3 Paternalistic Justification for Limiting Speech\n\nAlthough Stanley Fish takes some of the mystique away from the value\nof speech, he still thinks of limitations largely in terms of other-\nregarding consequences. There are arguments, however, that suggest\nspeech can be limited to prevent harm being done to the speaker. The\nargument here is that the agent might not have a full grasp of the\nconsequences of her actions(whether it be speech or some other form of\nbehavior) and hence can be prevented from engaging in the act.\nArguments used in the Skokie case would fit into this category and\nthere is evidence to suggest that watching pornography can cause\npsychological damage the viewer . Most liberals are wary of such\narguments because they take us into the realm of paternalistic\nintervention where it is assumed that the state knows better than the\nindividual what is in his or her best interests.\n\nMill, for example, is an opponent of paternalism generally, but he\ndoes believe there are certain instances when intervention is\nwarranted. He suggests that if a public official is certain that a\nbridge will collapse, he can prevent a person crossing. If, however,\nthere is only a danger that it will collapse the public can be warned\nbut not coerced from crossing. The decision here seems to depend on\nthe likelihood of personal injury; the more certain injury becomes,\nthe more legitimate the intervention. Prohibiting freedom of speech on\nthese grounds is very questionable for liberals in all but extreme\ncases (it was not persuasive in the Skokie case) because it is very\nrare that speech would produce such a clear danger to the\nindividual.\n\nWe have examined some of the options regarding limitations on free\nspeech and one cannot be classed as a liberal if one is willing to\nstray much further into the arena of state intervention than already\ndiscussed. Liberals tend to be united in opposing paternalistic and\nmoralistic justifications for limiting free expression. They hold a\nstrong presumption in favor of individual liberty because, it is\nargued, this is the only way that the autonomy of the individual can\nbe respected. Feinberg suggests that to prohibit speech for reasons\nother than those already mentioned means: \u201c[i]t can be morally\nlegitimate for the state, by means of the criminal law, to prohibit\ncertain types of action that cause neither harm nor offense to any\none, on the grounds that such actions constitute or cause evils of\nother kinds\u201d (1985, 3). Acts can be \u201cevil\u201d if they are\ndangerous to a traditional way of life, because they are immoral, or\nbecause they hinder the perfectibility of the human race. Many\narguments against pornography take the form that such material is\nwrong because of the moral harm it does to the consumer. Liberals\noppose such views because they are not impressed by states trying to\nmold the moral character of citizens.\n",
