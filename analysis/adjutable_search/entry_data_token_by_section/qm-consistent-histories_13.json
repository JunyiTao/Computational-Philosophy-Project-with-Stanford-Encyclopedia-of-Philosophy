    "main_text": "Quantum Reasoning || Counterfactual reasoning\n5.2 Counterfactual reasoning\nA counterfactual argument begins by imagining another world which\nresembles the actual world in certain respects and differs from it in\nothers, and asking the question: \u201cWhat would be the\ncase if instead of \u2026it were true that\n\u2026\u201d. For example, \u201cWhat would the weather be like in\nPittsburgh in January if the city were 1000 kilometers closer to the\nequator?\u201d In general, counterfactual reasoning is not easy to\nanalyze, and this gives rise to difficulties when trying to understand\nquantum paradoxes stated in counterfactual form. The basic principle\ngoverning counterfactual reasoning in the histories approach is the\nsingle framework rule, with the requirement that a comparison between\nthe real and the counterfactual world be carried out using\nthe same framework for both. For details, see the\nFurther Reading supplement\nand the applications in Sec. 10.4 below.\n\n\n",
