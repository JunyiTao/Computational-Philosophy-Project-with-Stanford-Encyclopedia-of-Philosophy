    "main_text": "Religion, Religious Experience and A Common Faith || Faith and God\n9.4 Faith and God\n\nDewey effort to naturalize religion (by shifting the focus toward a\nnon-transcendental understanding of \u201creligious\nexperience\u201d) also required a reinterpretation of other\ntraditional notions\u2014such as \u201cfaith\u201d and\n\u201cGod\u201d. Faith, typically, is juxtaposed with reason. Faith\nrequires neither empirical inquiry nor verification; one has faith in\nthe evidence of (transcendent, ultimate) things not seen. Also, faith\ntypically connotes intellectual acceptance, again without proof, of\nreligious propositions (such as \u201cGod exists and loves\nmankind\u201d).\n\nDewey made at least two important criticisms of traditional faith.\nFirst, faith is too closely identified with intellectual\nacceptance, which eclipses its pragmatic side; faith in a\ncause, for example, indicates a practical willingness to\nact strong enough to modify present desires, purposes, and\nconduct. By over-identifying the meaning of faith with intellectual\nrecognition, the traditional account attenuates inquiry and\nconstructive action. Second, traditional faith tends to reify its\nobjects (e.g., \u201csin\u201d, \u201cevil\u201d, etc.) converting\nthem, in effect, to surds immune to inquiry and redescription. The\nresulting creed is then deployed to \u201csolve\u201d problems with\nformulaic appeals to absolutes. In Dewey\u2019s view, the better\napproach is experimental\u2014complicated, living problems are more\neffectively address with experimental inquiry. Insofar as traditional\nfaith frustrates inquiry which could be ameliorative, it runs counter\nto the aims of morality.\n\nThe faith Dewey can accept is \u201cnatural piety\u201d.\nNatural piety is not grounded in unseen, supernatural powers but,\nDewey wrote, in a \u201cjust sense of nature as the whole of which we\nare parts\u201d and the recognition that as parts we are \n\n\nmarked by intelligence and purpose, having the capacity to strive by\ntheir aid to bring conditions into greater consonance with what is\nhumanly desirable. (ACF, LW9: 18) \n\n\nFaith grounded in natural piety accepts the idea that (again)\n\u201cexperience itself is the sole ultimate authority\u201d\n(\u201cWhat I Believe\u201d, LW5: 267).\n\nDewey\u2019s naturalism, of course, disallows a traditional\nGod\u2014a single being responsible for the physical and moral\nuniverse, and its inhabitants. Belief in God is neither warranted nor\nadvisable. Instead, Dewey offers a reconstruction of\n\u201cGod\u201d. Very briefly, he asks that we think not of a\nsingular object but of the qualities to which God is\ncompared\u2014goodness, wisdom, love. Such descriptions show that God\nrepresents our highest ideals. Remove the idea of a possessor\nof ideals and add in the way in which ideals pull from us the\nmeans (imagination, calculation, action) to put make ideas actual\n\u2014and one begins to grasp Dewey\u2019s notion. \n\n\nThis idea of God, or of the divine is also connected with all the\nnatural forces and conditions\u2014including man and human\nassociation\u2014that promote the growth of the ideal and that\nfurther its realization\u2026.It is this active relation between\nideal and actual to which I would give the name \u201cGod\u201d.\n(ACF, LW9: 34; see also 29\u201330)\n\n",
