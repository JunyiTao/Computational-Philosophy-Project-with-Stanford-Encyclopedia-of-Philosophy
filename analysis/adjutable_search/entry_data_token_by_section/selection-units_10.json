    "main_text": "An Anatomy of the Debates || Genic Selection: The Pluralists\n3.4 Genic Selection: The Pluralists.\n\nThe important point for now is that, on Dawkins\u2019 analysis, the\nfact that replicators are the only survivors of the\nevolution-by-selection process automatically answers also the question\nof who owns the adaptations. Adaptations must be seen as being\ndesigned for the good of the active-germ-line replicator for the\nsimple reason that replicators are the only entities around long\nenough to enjoy them over the course of natural selection. The genic\nselectionist acknowledges that the phenotype is \u201cthe all\nimportant instrument of replicator preservation,\u201d and that\ngenes\u2019 phenotypic effects are organized into organisms (that\nthereby might benefit from them in their lifetimes) (1982b: 114). But\nbecause only the active germ-line replicators survive, they are the\ntrue locus of adaptations (1982b: 113; emphasis added). The\nother things that benefit over the short term (e.g., organisms with\nadaptive traits) are merely the tools of the real survivors, the real\nowners. Hence, Dawkins rejects the vehicle approach partly because he\nidentifies it with the manifestor-of-adaptation approach, which he has\nanswered by definition, in terms of the long-term beneficiary.\n\nThe second key aspect of genic selectionists\u2019 views on\ninteractors is the desire to do away with them entirely. Dawkins is\naware that the vehicle concept is \u201cfundamental to the\npredominant orthodox approach to natural selection\u201d (1982b:\n116). Nevertheless, he rejects this approach in The Extended\nPhenotype, claiming, \u201cthe main purpose of this book is to\ndraw attention to the weaknesses of the whole vehicle concept\u201d\n(1982b: 115). But this \u201cvehicle\u201d approach is not\nequivalent to \u201cthe interactor question\u201d; it encompasses a\nmuch more restricted approach.\n\nIn particular, when arguing against \u201cthe vehicle concept,\u201d\nDawkins is only arguing against the desirability of seeing the\nindividual organism as the one and only possible vehicle. His target\nis explicitly those who hold what he calls the \u201cCentral\nTheorem,\u201d which says that individual organisms should be\nseen as maximizing their own inclusive fitness (1982b: 5, 55).\nThese arguments are indeed damaging to the Central theorem, but they\nare ineffective against other approaches that define units of\nselection as interactors.\n\nOne way to interpret the Central Theorem is that it implies that the\nindividual organism is always the beneficiary of any selection\nprocess. The genic selectionists seem to mean by\n\u201cbeneficiary\u201d both the manifestor of adaptation and that\nwhich survives to reap the rewards of the evolutionary process.\nDawkins argues, rightly and persuasively, I think, that it does not\nmake sense always to consider the individual organism to be the\nbeneficiary of a selection process.\n\nBut it is crucial to see that Dawkins is not arguing against the\nimportance of the interactor question in general, but rather against a\nparticular definition of a unit of selection. The view being\ncriticized assumes that the individual organism is the interactor,\nand the beneficiary, and the manifestor of\nadaptation. Consider the main argument against the utility of\nconsidering vehicles: the primary reason to abandon thinking about\nvehicles is that it confuses people (1982b: 189). But look at the\nexamples; their point is that it is inappropriate always to ask how an\norganism\u2019s behavior benefits that organism\u2019s inclusive\nfitness. We should ask instead, \u201cwhose inclusive fitness the\nbehavior is benefiting\u201d (1982b: 80). Dawkins states that his\npurpose in the book is to show that \u201ctheoretical dangers attend\nthe assumption that adaptations are for the good of\u2026the\nindividual organism\u201d (1982b: 91).\n\nSo, Dawkins is quite clear about what he means by the \u201cvehicle\nselection approach\u201d; it always assumes that the organism is the\nbeneficiary of its accrued inclusive fitness. Dawkins advances\npowerful arguments against the assumption that the organism is always\nthe interactor cum beneficiary cum manifestor of adaptations. This\napproach is clearly not equivalent to the approach to units of\nselection characterized as the interactor approach. Unfortunately,\ngenic selectionists extend Dawkins\u2019 conclusions to these other\napproaches, which he has, in fact, not addressed. The genic\nselectionists\u2019 lack of consideration of the interactor\ndefinition of a unit of selection leads to two grave problems with\nthis view.\n\nOne problem is the tendency to interpret all group selectionist claims\nas being about beneficiaries and manifestors of adaptations as well as\ninteractors. This is a serious misreading of authors who are pursuing\nthe interactor question alone.\n\nConsider, for example, this argument that groups should not be\nconsidered units of selection:\n\n\nTo the extent that active germ-line replicators benefit from the\nsurvival of the group of individuals in which they sit, over and above\nthe [effects of individual traits and altruism], we may expect to see\nadaptations for the preservation of the group. But all these\nadaptations will exist, fundamentally, through differential replicator\nsurvival. The basic beneficiary of any adaptation is the active\ngerm-line replicator (Dawkins 1982b: 85).\n\n\nNotice that this argument begins by admitting that groups can function\nas interactors, and even that group selection may effectively produce\ngroup-level adaptations. The argument that groups should not be\nconsidered real units of selection amounts to the claim that the\ngroups are not the ultimate beneficiaries. To counteract the intuition\nthat the groups do, of course, benefit, in some sense, from the\nadaptations, the terms \u201cfundamentally\u201d and\n\u201cbasic\u201d are used, thus signaling what the author considers\nthe most important level. Even if a group-level trait is affecting a\nchange in gene frequencies, \u201cit is still genes that are regarded\nas the replicators which actually survive (or fail to survive) as a\nconsequence of the (vehicle) selection process\u201d (Dawkins 1982b:\n115). Thus, the replicator is the unit of selection because it is the\nbeneficiary, and the real owner, of all adaptations that exist.\n\nSaying all this does not, however, address the fact that other\nresearchers investigating group selection are asking the interactor\nquestion and sometimes also the manifestor-of-adaptation question,\nrather than Dawkins\u2019 special version of the (ultimate)\nbeneficiary question. He gives no additional reason to reject these\nother questions as legitimate; he simply reasserts the superiority of\nhis own preferred unit of selection. In sum, Dawkins has identified\nthree criteria as necessary for something to be a unit of selection:\nit must be a replicator; it must be the most basic beneficiary of the\nselection process; and it is automatically the ultimate manifestor of\nadaptation through being the beneficiary.\n\nFinally, further work in the philosophy of biology brings the level of\nthe unit of selection down even further than the original genic\nselectionists do (Rosenberg 2006). Higher level selection is reducible\nto more fundamental\n levels.[15]\n Taking a reductionist stance, which is taken to be necessary to avoid\nan \u201cuntenable dualism\u201d in biology between physicalism and\nantireductionism, the argument is that the principle of natural\nselection (PNS) should be properly viewed as a basic law of physical\nscience (specifically chemistry), which can operate at the level of\natoms and molecules (Rosenberg 2006: 189\u2013191). Different\nmolecular environments would favor different chemical types, and those\nthat \u201cmore closely approximate an environmentally optimal\ncombination of stability and replication,\u201d are thus the\n\u201cfittest\u201d and would predominate (2006: 190). This could\nthen be applied at each step of the way from simple molecules to\ncompounds, organelles, cells, tissues, and so on, such that \n\n\nthe result at each level of chemical aggregation is the instantiation\nof another PNS, grounded in, or at least in principle derivable from,\nthe molecular interactions that follow the PNS in the environment\noperating at one or more lower levels of aggregation. (Rosenberg 2006:\n192)\n\n\nThis approach addresses antireductionist arguments regarding group\nlevel properties. The claim is that this new envisioning of the PNS as\na purely physical law allows us to better understand the lower level\norigins of apparently higher level causes, thus revealing that\n\u201cthe appearance of \u2018downward causation\u2019 is just\nthat: mere appearance.\u201d (Rosenberg 2006: 197) For example, the\nclaim is that group level selection explanations, such as are commonly\ngiven for altruism, do not require an antireductionist stance, since\nphysical laws, such as that second law of thermodynamics, can allow\nfor local unfavorable changes (in this case, local decreases in\nentropy) as long as compensation is made elsewhere. With regard to the\nphysical PNS, \n\n\ngroups of biological individuals may experience fitness increases at\nthe expense of fitness decreases among their individual members for\nperiods of time that will depend on the size and composition of the\ngroup and the fitness effects of their traits. What the PNS will not\npermit is long-term fitness changes at the level of groups without\nlong-term fitness changes in the same direction among some or all of\nthe individuals composing them. (Rosenberg 2006: 198) \n\n\nIn other words, this is supposed to show that there is no need to\nthink in terms of irreducible group level interactors. Again, note\nthat this analysis merges characteristics of interactors and\nreplicators.\n\nIn the next section, we will consider some relatively more recent work\nin which genic selectionism is defended through a pluralist approach\nto modeling. What matters in the final analysis, though, is exactly\nwhat matters to the original genic selectionists, and that is the\nsearch for the ultimate beneficiary of the evolution by selection\nprocess.\n3.4 Genic Selection: The Pluralists\n\nAs we saw in the previous section, the original genic selectionists\nhad particular problems with their treatment of the interactor. While\nthey admitted that the \u201cvehicle\u201d was necessary for the\nselection process, they did not want to accord it any weight in the\nunits of selection debate because it was not the beneficiary, but\nrather an agent of the beneficiary. Soon, however, there emerged a new\nangle available to genic selectionists (Waters\n 1986).[16]\n\nThe new \u201cgenic pluralism\u201d appears to let one bypass the\ninteractor question, by, in effect, turning genes into interactors\n(Sterelny & Kitcher 1988). The proposal is that there are two\n\u201cimages\u201d of natural selection, one in which selection\naccounts are given in terms of a hierarchy of entities and their\ntraits\u2019 environments, the other of which is given in terms of\ngenes having properties that affect their abilities to leave\ncopies of themselves (Sterelny & Kitcher 1988; see Kitcher,\nSterelny, & Waters 1990, Sterelny 1996a,b; Waters 1986,\n 1991).[17]\n Something significant follows from the fact that hierarchical models\nor selection processes can be reformulated in terms of the genic\nlevel. These claims have been resisted on a variety of grounds (see\nobjections in R.A. Wilson 2003, Stanford 2001, Van der Steen & van\nden Berg 1999, Gannett 1999, Shanahan 1997, Glennan 2002, Sober 1990,\nSober & Wilson 1998, Brandon & Nijhout 2006, Sarkar 2008).\n\nThe big payoff of the genic point of view is: \n\n\nOnce the possibility of many, equally adequate, representations of\nevolutionary processes has been recognized, philosophers and\nbiologists can turn their attention to more serious projects than that\nof quibbling about the real unit of selection. (Kitcher, Sterelny,\n& Waters 1990: 161)\n\n\nBy \u201cquibbling about the real unit of selection,\u201d here, the\nauthors seem to be referring to the large range of articles in which\nevolutionists have tried to give concrete evidence and requirements\nfor something to serve as an interactor in a selection process.\n\nAs an aside, it is important to note that none of the philosophers are\nadvocating genic selectionism to the exclusion of other views. What\ninterests them is a proposed equivalence between being able to tell\nthe selection story one way, in terms of interactors and replicators,\nand to tell the same story another way, purely in terms of\n\u201cgenic agency\u201d. Thus, they are pluralists, in that they\nare not ultimately arguing in favor of the genic view; they are,\nhowever, expanding the genic selectionist view beyond its previous\nlimits.\n\nThe pluralists attack the view that \u201cfor any selection process,\nthere is a uniquely correct identification of the operative selective\nforces and the level at which each impinges\u201d (Waters 1991: 553).\nRather, they claim, \u201cWe believe that asking about the real unit\nof selection is an exercise in muddled metaphysics\u201d (Kitcher,\nSterelny, & Waters 1990: 159). The basic view is that \u201cthe\ncauses of one and the same selection process can be correctly\ndescribed at different levels\u201d (including the genic one) (Waters\n1991: 555). Moreover, these descriptions are on equal ontological\nfooting. Equal, that is, except for when Sterelny and Kitcher slip over into a\ngenuinely reductionist genic view, when they state that it is an error\nto claim \n\n\nthat selection processes must be described in a particular way, and\ntheir error involves them in positing entities, \u201ctargets of\nselection,\u201d that do not exist. (1988: 359) \n\n\nHere they seem to be denying the existence of interactors altogether.\nIf interactors don\u2019t exist, then clearly a genic level account\nof the phenomena would be preferable to, not merely equivalent to, a\nhierarchical view.\n\nThe pluralists do seem to be arguing against the utility of the notion\nof the interactor in studying the selection process. Echoing the\noriginal genic selectionists, their idea is that the whole causal\nstory can be told at the level of genes, and that no higher level\nentities need be proposed or considered in order to have an accurate\nand complete explanation of the selection process. But, arguably, the\ngenic level story cannot be told without taking the functional role of\ninteractors into account, and thus the pluralists cannot avoid\nquibbling about interactors, as they claim (see Lloyd 2005). Nor is\nthe genic account adequate to all selection cases; the genic account\nfails when drift is factored in (Brandon & Nijhout 2006).\n\nLet us recall what the interactor question in the units of selection\ndebate amounts to: What levels of entities interact with their\nenvironments through their traits in such a way that it makes a\ndifference to replicator success? As mentioned before, there has been\nmuch discussion in the literature about how to delineate and locate\ninteractors among multilayered processes of selection. Each of these\nsuggestions leads to slightly different results and different problems\nand limitations, but each also takes the notion of the interactor\nseriously as a necessary component to understanding a selection\nprocess.\n\nThe genic pluralists state that \u201cAll selective episodes (or,\nperhaps, almost all) can be interpreted in terms of genic selection.\nThat is an important fact about natural selection\u201d (Kitcher,\nSterelny, & Waters 1990: 160). Thus, the functional claim of the\npluralists is that anything that a hierarchical selection model can\ndo, a genic selection model can do just as well. Much attention is\npaid to showing that the two types of models can represent certain\npatterns of selection equally well, even those that are conventionally\nconsidered hierarchical selection. This is argued for using both\nspecific examples and schema for translating hierarchical models into\ngenic ones. Let us consider one challenging case here.\n\nTake the classic account of the efficacy of interdemic or group\nselection, the case that even G.C. Williams acknowledged was\nhierarchical selection. Lewontin and Dunn (Lewontin & Dunn 1960\nand Lewontin 1962), in investigating the house mouse, found first,\nthat there was segregation distortion, in that over 80% of the sperm\nfrom mice heterozygous for the t-allele also carried the t-allele,\nwhereas the expected rate would be 50%. Second, they also found that\nmale homozygotes (those with two t-alleles) tended to be sterile. (In\nseveral populations the t-alleles were homozygous lethal, but in the\npopulations in question, homozygous males were sterile.) Third, they\nalso found a substantial effect of group extinction based on the fact\nthat female mice would often find themselves in groups in which all\nmales were sterile, and the group itself would therefore go\nextinct. This, then, is how a genuine and empirically robust\nhierarchical model was developed.\n\nWhat the pluralists want to note about this case is very narrow, that\nis \n\n\nwhether there are real examples of processes that can be modeled as\ngroup selection can be asked and answered entirely within the\ngenic point of view. (Kitcher, Sterelny, & Waters 1990: 160)\n\n\n\nJust as a warning to the unwary, the key to understanding the genic\nreinterpretation of this case is to grasp that the pluralists use a\nconcept of genetic environment that their critics ignore.\n\nThe pluralists tell how to \u201cconstruct\u201d a genic model of\nthe causes responsible for the frequency of the t-allele. We must\nfirst distinguish \n\n\ngenetic environments that are contained within female mice that are\ntrapped in small populations with only sterile males from genetic\nenvironments that are not contained within such females. In effect,\nthe interactions at the group level would be built in as a part of one\nkind of genetic environment. (Waters 1991: 563) \n\n\nIn other words, various very detailed environments would have to be\nspecified for various different t-alleles and wild-type alleles. In\norder to determine the invariant fitness parameter of a specific\nallele, let\u2019s call it \u201cA\u201d for example, we would need\nto know what kind of environment it is in at the allelic level, e.g.,\nwhether it is paired with a t-allele. Then we would need to know a\nfurther detailed layer of the environment of \u201cA\u201d, such as\nwhat the sex is of the \u201cenvironment\u201d it is in. If it is in\na t-allele arrangement, and it is also in a male environment, the\nallelic fitness of \u201cA\u201d would be changed. Finally, we need\nto know the type of subpopulation or deme the \u201cA\u201d allele\nis in. Is it in a small deme with many t-alleles? Then it is more\nlikely to become extinct. So, as we can see, various aspects of the\nallele\u2019s environment are built up from the gene out, depending\non what would make a difference to the gene\u2019s fitness in that\nvery particular kind of environment. If you want to know the overall\nfitness of the \u201cA\u201d allele, you add up the fitnesses in\neach set of specialized, detailed environments and weight them\naccording to the frequency of that environment.\n\nThe idea is: \n\n\nWhat appears as a multiple level selection process (e.g., selection of\nthe t-allele) to those who draw the conceptual divide [between\nenvironments] at the traditional level, appears to genic selectionists\nof Williams\u2019s style as several selection processes being carried\nout at the same level within different genetic environments. (Waters\n1991: 571) \n\n\nThe \u201csame level\u201d here means the \u201cgenic level,\u201d\nwhile the genetic environments include everything from the other\nallele at the locus, to whether the genotype is present in a male or\nfemale mouse, to the size and composition of the deme the mouse is in.\nThis completes the sketch of the genic pluralist position. We now turn\nto its reception.\n\nGenic pluralism\u2019s impact has been largely philosophical rather\nthan biological (but see Shanahan 1997 and Van der Steen & Van den\nBerg 1999). Within philosophy, the view has been widely disseminated\nand taught, and a steady stream of critical responses to the genic\npluralist position has been forthcoming. These responses fall into two\nmain categories: pragmatic and causal.\n\nThe pragmatic response to genic pluralism simply notes that in any\ngiven selective scenario the genic perspective provides no information\nthat is not also available from the hierarchical point of view. This\nstate of affairs is taken by critics of this type as sufficient reason\nto prefer whichever perspective is most useful for solving the\nproblems facing a particular researcher (Glymour 1999; Van der Steen\n& Van den Berg 1999; and Shanahan 1997). The weakness of this\napproach as a critique of genic pluralism is that it does not so much\ncriticize genic pluralism as simply ignore it.\n\nThe other major form of critique of genic pluralism is based on\narguments concerning the causal structure of selective episodes. The\nidea here is that while genic pluralism gets the \u201cgenetic\nbook-keeping\u201d (i.e., the input/output relations) correct, it\ndoes not accurately reflect the causal processes that bring about the\nresult in question (Wimsatt 1980a,b). Some examples of this approach used against the\ngenic pluralists (including Sober 1990; Sober & Wilson 1994,\n1998) also appeal to aspects of the manifestor-of-adaptations and\nbeneficiary questions to establish the failure of genic pluralism to\nrepresent certain selective events correctly. Causal concerns are also\nraised in some other work (Shanahan 1997, Van der Steen and Van den\nBerg 1999, Stanford 2001, and Glennan 2002), though without the focus\non other units questions. The weakness of this line of criticism is\nits inability to isolate a notion of cause that is both plausible and\nplausibly true of hierarchical but not genic level models. This\nfeature\u2014that the genic and hierarchical models are so similar as\nto be indistinguishable\u2014which appears as an insurmountable\nproblem in the context of debates about differing causal structure,\nturns out to be the locus of critical response to genic pluralism,\nwhich denies that the genic selectionists have any distinct and\ncoherent genic level causes at all (Lloyd 2005; Lloyd et al.\n2005).\n\nGenic pluralism presents alleles as independent causal entities, with\nthe claim that the availability of such models makes hierarchical\nselection models\u2014and the ensuing debates about how to identify\ninteractors in selection processes\u2014moot. Or, in a less\ncontentious version of the argument, the hierarchical and genic models\nare fully developed causal alternatives (Waters 1991). However, in\neach case of the causal allelic models, these models are directly and\ncompletely derived from precisely the hierarchical models the authors\nreject. Moreover, causal claims made on behalf of alleles are utterly\ndependent on hierarchically identified and established interactors\nas causes, thus undermining their claims that the units of\nselection (interactor) debates are mere \u201cquibbles\u201d and are\nirrelevant to the representation of selection processes. Moreover, and\ncontrary to the claims of pluralists, cases of frequency-dependence,\nsuch as in heterosis and in game-theoretic models of selection,\nnecessitate selection at higher than genic levels because the relevant\nproperties of the entities at the genic level are only definable\nrelative to higher levels of organization. Thus, they cannot be\nproperly described as properties of alleles nor are they \u201ceven\ndefinable at the allelic level.\u201d (Sarkar 2008: 219) In addition,\nwhen drift is taken into account, the genic accounts fail to be\nempirically adequate (Brandon & Nijhout 2006).\n\nWe can say that the allelic level models are completely derivative\nfrom higher level models of selection processes using the following\nguidelines (Lloyd 2005). Two models that are mathematically equivalent\nmay be semantically different, that is, they have different\ninterpretations. Such models can be independent from one another or\none may be derivative of the other. In the genic selection case, the\npluralists appear to be claiming that the genic level models are\nindependent from the hierarchical models. The claim is: although the\ngenic models are mathematically equivalent, they have different\nparameters, and a different interpretation, and they are completely\nindependent from hierarchical models.\n\nBut, despite the pluralists\u2019 repeated claims, we can see from\ntheir own calculations and examples that theirs are\nderivative models, and thus, that their \u201cgenic\u201d\nlevel causes are derivative from and dependent on higher level causes.\nTheir genic level models depend for their empirical, causal, and\nexplanatory adequacy on entire mathematical structures taken from the\nhierarchical models and refashioned.\n\nAs reviewed above, one example from their own writing comes from the\ntreatment of the t-allele case, a universally recognized case of three\nlevels of selection operating simultaneously on a single allele. Right\nbefore the t-allele case, a suggestion is offered that a\nWilliams\u2019s type analysis could be based on an application of\nLloyd\u2019s additivity criterion for identifying\ninteractors, which is strictly hierarchical (Waters 1991:\n563; Lloyd [1988] 1994: Ch. 5). Thus, the pluralist suggestion is to\nborrow a method for identifying potential higher-level interactors in\norder to determine the genic environments and thus to have more\nadequate genic level models. Similarly, other pluralists resort to a\ntraditional approach to identifying interactors in order to make their\ngenic models work. It had earlier been proposed that the statistical\nidea of screening off be used to identify which levels of entities are\ncausally effective in the selection process; i.e., it is a method used\nto isolate interactors (Brandon 1982). But some pluralists propose\nusing screening off to identify layers of allelic environments, and\nalso show how Sober\u2019s probabilistic causal account could be used\nfor a genic account (Sterelny & Kitcher 1988: 354).\n\nHence, the pluralists all use the same methods for isolating relevant\ngenic-level environments as others do for the traditional isolating of\ninteractors. What, we may ask, is the real difference? Both can be\nseen as attempting to get the causal influences on selection right,\nbecause they are using the same methods. What is different is that the\ngenic selectionists want to tell the causal story in terms of genes\nand not in terms of interactors and genes. Moreover, they propose\ndoing away with interactors altogether, by renaming them the\ngenic-level environments. Are we to think that renaming changes the\nmetaphysics of the situation?\n\nIt seems that levels of interaction important to the outcome of the\nselection process are being discovered in the usual ways, i.e., by\nusing approaches to interactors and their environments, and that that\nexact same information is being translated into talk of the\ndifferentiated and layered environments of the genes.\n\nThe issue concerning renaming model structures is especially confusing\nin the genic pluralists presentations, because they repeatedly rely on\nan assumption or intuition that, given an allelic state space, we are\ndealing with allelic causes. This last assumption is easily traced\nback to the original genic selectionist views that alleles are the\nultimate beneficiaries of any long term selection process (Williams\n1966; Dawkins 1982a,b); thus, the genic pluralist argument rests\nsubstantially on a view regarding the superior importance of the\nbeneficiary question, which has been clearly delineated from the\ninteractor question, above.\n\nLet us summarize the consequences of derivativeness in terms of the\nscience and metaphysics of the processes discussed. First, the genic\npluralists end up offering not, as they claim, a variety of genuinely\ndiverse causal versions of the selection process at different levels.\nThis is because the causes of the hierarchical models, however\ndetermined, are simply transformed and renamed in the lower level\nmodels, but remain fully intact as relevant causes at the full range\nof higher and lower levels. More importantly, no new allelic causes\nare introduced. Second, while genic models may be derived from\nhierarchical models, they fail to sustain the necessary supporting\nmethodology. Third, the lack of genuine alternative causal accounts\ndestroys the claims of pluralism or, at least, of any interesting\nphilosophical variety, since there are no genuine alternatives being\npresented, unless you count renaming model structures as\nmetaphysically significant (see also Okasha\n 2011).[18]\n Thus, the picture of proposing an alternative\n\u201cinteractor\u201d at the genic level is not fulfilled (vs.\nSterelny & Kitcher 1988). Perhaps the best way to save the\npluralist vision is to appeal to the work on neighbor selection\n(Godfrey-Smith 2008),\nwhich can be cast within a pluralist program. This effort is to revive\nand discuss an alternative fashion of modeling altruism or group\nbenefit, within the terms of a lower, individual level (see the\ndiscussion in\n section 3.1, Genic Selection: The Originators).\n\nThere is a further complication with respect to the nature of the\ngenic selection models put forward by genic pluralists. These models\nfunction under the presupposition that they are at least\nmathematically equivalent to hierarchical models. This claim has\nlargely depended on the work of Dugatkin and Reeve in establishing\nthis equivalence (Dugatkin & Reeve 1994, Sterelny 1996b, Sober\n& Wilson 1998, Sterelny & Griffiths 1999, Kerr &\nGodfrey-Smith 2002a, Waters 2005). However, foundational work has\nindicated that this equivalence does not in fact hold. In Dugatkin and\nReeve and the rest of this literature, comparison of population\ngenetic models was largely based on predictions of allele frequency\nchanges; in other words, if two models made the same predictions as to\nthe changes of allelic frequencies in a given situation, then the\nmodels are equivalent. However, this is an overly simplistic method\nfor testing model equivalence which pays little mind to the details of\nthe models themselves. When the notion of representational adequacy of\nthe models is taken into account, specifically through the inclusion\nof parametric and dynamical sufficiency as important points of\ncomparison, this equivalence between genic and hierarchical models\ndisappears (Lloyd, Lewontin, & Feldman 2008; Lewontin 1974; see\nalso\n group selection\n for more on formal equivalence).\n\nParametric sufficiency concerns what state space and variables are\nsufficient to capture the relevant properties of a given system, while\ndynamical sufficiency \n\n\nconcerns what state space and variables are sufficient to describe the\nevolution of a system given the parameters being used in the specific\nsystem. (Lloyd, Lewontin, & Feldman 2008: 146; Lewontin 1974) \n\n\nUtilizing these concepts allows for a more detailed and meaningful\nevaluation of a given mathematical model. And under such an analysis,\nthe claims regarding the equivalency of genic and hierarchical models\ncannot be sustained. Since allelic parameters and the changes in\nallelic frequencies depend on genotypic fitnesses, the genic models\nclaimed to be equivalent to the hierarchical models are neither\nparametrically nor dynamically\n sufficient.[19]\n",
