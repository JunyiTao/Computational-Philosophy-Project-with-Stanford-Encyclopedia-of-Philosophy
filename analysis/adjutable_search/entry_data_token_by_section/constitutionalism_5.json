    "main_text": "Constitutional Law versus Constitutional Convention\n6. Constitutional Law versus Constitutional Convention\n\nThe idea of constitutionalism requires limitation on government power\nand authority established by constitutional law. But according to most\nconstitutional scholars, there is more to a constitution than\nconstitutional law. Many people will find this suggestion puzzling,\nbelieving their constitution to be nothing more (and nothing less)\nthan (usually) a formal, written document, possibly adopted at a\nspecial constitutional assembly, which contains the nation\u2019s\nsupreme, fundamental law. But there is a long-standing tradition of\nconceiving of constitutions as containing much more than\nconstitutional law. Dicey is famous for proposing that, in addition to\nconstitutional law, the British constitutional system contains a\nnumber of constitutional conventions which effectively limit\ngovernment in the absence of legal limitation. These are, in effect,\nsocial rules arising within the practices of the political\ncommunity and which impose important, but non-legal, limits\non government powers. An example of a British constitutional\nconvention is the rule that the British Monarch may not refuse Royal\nAssent to any bill passed by both Houses of the UK Parliament. Perhaps\nanother example lies in a convention that individuals chosen to\nrepresent the State of Florida in the American Electoral College (the\nbody which actually chooses the American President by majority vote)\nmust vote for the Presidential candidate for whom a plurality of\nFloridians voted on election night. Owing to the fact that they are\npolitical conventions, unenforceable in courts of law, constitutional\nconventions are said to be distinguishable from constitutional laws,\nwhich can indeed be legally enforced. If we accept Dicey\u2019s\ndistinction, we must not identify the constitution with constitutional\nlaw. It includes constitutional conventions as well. We must further\nrecognize the possibility that a government, though legally\nwithin its power to embark upon a particular course of action, might\nnevertheless be constitutionally prohibited from doing\n so.[11]\n It is possible that, as a matter of constitutional law, Regina might\nenjoy unlimited legislative, executive and judicial powers which are\nnonetheless limited by constitutional conventions specifying how those\npowers are to be exercised. Should she violate one of these\nconventions, she would be acting legally, but unconstitutionally, and\nher subjects might well feel warranted in condemning her actions,\nperhaps even removing her from office\u2014a puzzling result only if\none thinks that all there is to a constitution is constitutional\nlaw.\n",
