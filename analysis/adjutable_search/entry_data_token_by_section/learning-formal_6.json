    "main_text": "Case Studies from Scientific Practice || Conservation Laws in Particle Physics\n2.1 Conservation Laws in Particle Physics\n\nOne of the hallmarks of elementary particle physics is the discovery\nof new conservation laws that apply only in the subatomic realm [Ford\n1963, Ne\u2019eman and Kirsh 1983, Feynman 1965]. (Feynman groups one\nof them, the conservation of Baryon Number, with the other\n\u201cgreat conservation laws\u201d of energy, charge and momentum.)\nSimplifying somewhat, conservation principles serve to explain why\ncertain processes involving elementary particles do  not \noccur: the explanation is that some conservation principle was\nviolated (cf. Omnes [1971, Ch.2] and Ford [1963]). So a goal of\nparticle inquiry is to find a set of conservation principles such that\nfor every process that is possible according to the (already known)\nlaws of physics, but fails to be observed experimentally, there is\nsome conservation principle that rules out that process. And if a\nprocess is in fact observed to occur, then it ought to satisfy all\nconservation laws that we have introduced.\n\nThis constitutes an inference problem to which we may apply means-ends\nanalysis. An inference method produces a set of conservation\nprinciples in response to reports of observed processes. Means-ends\nanalysis asks which methods are guaranteed to settle on conservation\nprinciples that account for all observations, that is, that rule out\nunobserved processes and allow observed processes. Schulte [2008]\ndescribes an inductive method that accomplishes this goal. Informally\nthe method may be described as follows.\n\nSuppose we have observed a set of reactions among elementary\nparticles.\nConjecture a set of conservation laws that permits the observed\nreactions and rules out as many unobserved reactions as\npossible.\n\n\nThe logic of conservation laws is such that the observation of some\nreactions entails the possibility of other unobserved ones. The\nlearning-theoretic method rules out all reactions that are not\nentailed. It turns out that the conservation principles that this\nmethod would posit on the currently available evidence are \nempirically equivalent  to the ones that physicists have\nintroduced. Specifically, their predictions agree exactly with the\nconservation of charge, baryon number, muon number, tau number and\nLepton number that is part of the Standard Model of particle\nphysics.\n\nFor some physical processes, the only way to get empirically adequate\nconservation principles is by positing that some hidden particles have\ngone undetected. Schulte [2009] extends the analysis such that an\ninductive method may not only introduce conservation laws, but also\nposit unseen particles. The basic principle is again to posit unseen\nparticles in such a way that we rule out as many unobserved reactions\nas possible. When this method is applied to the known particle data,\nit rediscovers the existence of an electron antineutrino. This is one\nof the particles of key concern in current particle physics.\n",
