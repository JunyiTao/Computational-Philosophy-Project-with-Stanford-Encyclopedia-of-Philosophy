    "main_text": "Some varieties of definition || Descriptive definitions\n1.4 Descriptive definitions\n\nDescriptive definitions, like stipulative ones, spell out meaning, but\nthey also aim to be adequate to existing usage. When philosophers\noffer definitions of, e.g., \u2018know\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019,\nthey are not being stipulative: a lack of fit with existing usage is\nan objection to them.\n\nIt is useful to distinguish three grades of descriptive adequacy of a\ndefinition: extensional, intensional, and sense. A definition is\nextensionally adequate iff there are no actual\ncounterexamples to it; it is intensionally adequate iff there\nare no possible counterexamples to it; and it is sense\nadequate (or analytic) iff it endows the defined term\nwith the right sense. (The last grade of adequacy itself subdivides\ninto different notions, for \u201csense\u201d can be spelled out in\nseveral different ways.) The definition \u201cWater is\nH2O,\u201d for example, is intensionally adequate because\nthe identity of water and H2O is necessary (assuming the\nKripke-Putnam view about the rigidity of natural-kind terms); the\ndefinition is therefore extensionally adequate also. But it is not\nsense-adequate, for the sense of \u2018water\u2019 is not at all the\nsame as that of \u2018H2O\u2019. The definition\n\u2018George Washington is the first President of the United\nStates\u2019 is adequate only extensionally but not in the other two\ngrades, while \u2018man is a laughing animal\u2019 fails to be\nadequate in all three grades. When definitions are put to an\nepistemological use, intensional adequacy is generally insufficient.\nFor such definitions cannot underwrite the rationality or the\napriority of a problematic subject matter.\n\nSee Quine 1951 & 1960 for skepticism about analytic definitions;\nsee also the entry on the\n analytic/synthetic distinction.\n Horty 2007 offers some ways of thinking about senses of defined\nexpressions, especially within a Fregean semantic theory.\n",
