While he reiterated earlier views about levels of activity,\nBergsonian tensions of consciousness, and the structure of the social\nworld, his work took a decidedly pragmatic twist, emphasizing\n\u201cworking\u201d (Wirken) as involving bodily movements\nas opposed to the covert performances of mere thinking. In manuscripts\nin the 1930s and after The Phenomenology of the Social World,\nSchutz had already turned in this pragmatic direction. In \u201cOn\nMultiple Realities,\u201d he enlarged upon the \u201cworld of\nworking\u201d by demonstrating how reflection dissolves the self\nunified in lived action into partial, role-taking selves and by\nexpanding Mead\u2019s idea of the \u201cmanipulatory sphere\u201d\nto include worlds within \u201cpotential reach,\u201d either\nrestorable (from the past) or attainable (in the future). This\n\u201cworld of working\u201d constitutes the paramount reality,\norganized in its interests in the face of the fundamental anxiety that\nderives, as it did for Heidegger, from the inescapability of\none\u2019s own death. Following Husserl\u2019s views on how\nconsciousness can modify its stances toward reality and\nde-ontologizing James\u2019s sub-universes of reality, Schutz\ndeveloped the notion of various finite provinces of meaning. One\nenters any of these provinces, such as those of phantasms, dreams, the\ntheater, religious experience, or theoretical contemplation, by\nundergoing different types of epoch\u00e9, analogous to the\nphenomenological prototype, as when one slips into a daydream, falls\nasleep, watches theater curtains open, commences a ritual, or assumes\nthe scientist\u2019s role. Each province contains its distinctive\nlogical, temporal, corporal, and social dimensions, and movement\nbetween the provinces only becomes paradoxical (e.g., asking how\nphenomenologists are able to communicate their private findings\npublicly) if one conceives the provinces as ontological static realms\nto which one transmigrates as a soul to another world. Rather the\nprovinces are permeable, and one adopts the attitudes of scientist or\nreligious believer within the world of working as if it were\nseen through by another viewpoint, all the while that its\ncommunicative activities subtend these other provinces. There is\nsomething paradoxical, though, about describing one\u2019s dreams or\ntheorizing about religious experience since to give an account one\nmust absent oneself from the province for which one accounts, and\nKierkegaard\u2019s notion of indirect communication and various\npostmodern critiques of theory address themselves to just such\nparadoxes.\n\nThe essay on multiple realities underpins Schutz\u2019s theory of\nsigns and symbols in \u201cSymbol, Reality, and Society,\u201d\npublished almost ten years later. Synthesizing the notion of potential\nreach from the earlier essay with Husserl\u2019s concept of\nappresentation, namely that one element of a pair refers to\nanother not directly given in experience, Schutz describes how agents\novercome whatever transcends them. Hence they leave marks to\nbring within reach what they leave behind (e.g., breaking a twig to\nremind oneself to turn when one returns) or follow\nindications, that is, regular connections not of their making\n(e.g. smoke indicating a not yet visible fire), to bring within their\nknowledge what lies beyond it. Signs, however, appresent in\nan intersubjective setting the meanings of one person to another, but\nan insuperable transcendence still remains insofar as the each\none\u2019s stream of consciousness and therefore meanings are never\nidentical with another\u2019s. Finally, through symbols,\ndeveloped within groups, something given within everyday reality\nappresents a reality belonging to a entirely different province of\nmeaning, an ultimate transcendence (e.g., the stone where Jacob\ndreamed of a ladder to heaven memorializes God, accessible within the\nreligious province of meaning).\n\nSchutz dealt with this theme of language in other contexts, comparing\nHusserl\u2019s distinction between prepredicative (prepropositional)\nand predicative levels with Kurt Goldstein\u2019s separation, based\non studies of brain lesions, of a concrete attitude relying on\nautomatic speech associations from an abstract attitude forming\npropositions and utilizing rational language. Husserl\u2019s\nprepredicative/predicative differentiation plays a key role in\nSchutz\u2019s essay \u201cType and Eidos in Husserl\u2019s Late\nPhilosophy,\u201d in which he shows a gradual development from\nempirical types passively constituted within the prepredicative sphere\nto presumptive universals spontaneously formed in the predicative\nsphere. At the predicative level, scientific reflection further\ntransforms nonessential types (e.g., that whales are fish) into\nessential ones (whales are mammals), and philosophy seeks eidetic\nuniversals. At the end of this essay, Schutz speculates whether the\nHusserlian method of freely varying examples to determine the\nessential features that survive through such variations is not\nconstrained by both ontological structure (e.g., sounds are not\ncolors) and the socially shaped, natural-attitude experience of types.\nIn his essay \u201cTiresias, or our Knowledge of Future\nEvents,\u201d produced contemporaneously with the type essay, Schutz\nexplains how knowledge based on natural attitude types functions in\ncontrast to the mythical Tiresias\u2019 knowledge of the future,\nwhich is private and detached from his present or past experience.\nThese types, based on past experiences or socially transmitted, aim at\nfuture occurrences not in their uniqueness but with an emptiness that\nfuture events will fill in, such that only in retrospect, after an\nevent occurs, is one able to determine how much that event was\nexpected or unexpected. Finally, there are future events lying beyond\none\u2019s influence that one expects only to conform with past\nexperience and there are indeterminate projects that provide\ndirection\u2014not too tightly, though\u2014as one gives shape to\nwhat is within one\u2019s power.\n\nSchutz, himself a trained pianist and widely read musicologist,\nintegrated his phenomenology with his understanding of music. Music,\ndiffering from language in being non-representative, lends itself to\nphenomenological analysis in the meaning it carries beyond its mere\nphysical nature as sound waves and in its character as an ideal object\nthat must be constituted through its unfolding stages, i.e.,\npolythetically. Further music is bound to inner temporality, and its\nthemes, even though their note sequences are the same, vary according\nto context, require reflection for their recognition, and emerge\nthrough an interplay between musical elements and the listener\u2019s\nattention and interest. Schutz found music instructive in regard to\nsocial relationships insofar as, prior to any communication, parties\nto musical performances establish a non-linguistic, non-conceptual\n\u201cmutual tuning in relationship.\u201d This\n\u201ctuning-in,\u201d this sharing of another\u2019s flux of\nexperience in inner time already described in his\nPhenomenology, is very clearly exhibited whenever a listener\nto a musical performance participates in quasi-simultaneity in the\ncomposer\u2019s stream of consciousness or when co-performers orient\nthemselves to each other, the composer, and the audience. Hence,\nSchutz disagreed with Maurice Halbwachs who posited musical notation\nas the basis of social relationships between performers, when in fact\nit is merely a technical device accidental to their relationship. In\nanother essay, Schutz depicted Mozart as a social scientist,\npresenting a succession of situations that different characters\ninterpret, and Schutz showed how orchestral representations of\ncharacters and their moods in melody made possible a simultaneity of\nfluxes of inner time that the non-operatic, non musical dramatist\ncould only unfold successively. Without self-consciously\nphilosophizing, Mozart conveyed in music and better than most\nphilosophers in their own medium, how human beings meet each other as\na \u201cWe.\u201d\n\nFred Kersten discovers in Schutz\u2019s musical writings important\nphilosophical insights. For instance, music and inner time unfold\npolythetically and cannot be grasped monothetically; that is, one must\nlive through the unfolding of a symphony or inner experience, and any\nconceptual summary of their contents inevitably fails to do justice to\ntheir meaning. However, since all conceptualization consists in a\nmonothetical grasping of polythetic stages, Schutz is actually\nrealizing that certain dimensions of consciousness elude\nconceptualization and thus demarcating the limits of rationalization,\njust as he had pointed out how certain provinces of meaning (e.g.\ndreams) evade theoretic comprehension or duration eludes memory.\nAccording to Kersten, Schutz has seen clearly that the passive\nassociations of listening (e.g. recognizing the appearance of\nsymphonic theme) differ from those of sight (e.g., apprehending an\nobject like a house) and that listening does not identify numerically\ndistinct items but produces an illusion of identification.\nSchutz\u2019s conclusion that sameness in music involves not\nnumerical unity but recurrent likeness challenges the fundamental\nHusserlian thesis that the synthesis of passive identification is\nuniversal, at the basis of the constitution of the world.\n\nSchutz was also a master of literature, a careful student of the works\nof Goethe, and author of an article that analyzed Miguel de\nCervantes\u2019s Don Quixote through the prism of the theory\nof multiple realities. Cervantes repeatedly brings Quixote\u2019s\n\u201cworld of chivalry\u201d\u2014an order of reality with its\narguments for its own reality, its stock of knowledge, modes of social\nreinforcement, and views about space, time, and causality\u2014into\nconflict with the worlds of drama, common sense, and science. Although\nQuixote is capable of constructing a defense of his own chivalrous\nworld from within that world, the fact that this phantasied world\ncontains an enclave of dreams (at the cave of Montesinos) ends up\nundermining it by raising the possibility that it itself is but a\ndream. Quixote\u2019s withdrawal of the accent of reality from his\nprivate province of meaning reveals for Schutz the importance of the\nparamount reality of everyday life and the value of Sancho Panza who\n\u201cremains deeply rooted in the heritage of common sense.\u201d\n(Schutz 1964, 158)\n\nSchutz also brought his phenomenology to bear on political issues such\nas citizenship or racial equality. His essay \u201cThe Well-Informed\nCitizen,\u201d dealing not only with citizenship but also the\nsociology of knowledge under the rubric of the social distribution of\nknowledge, constructs ideal types of the expert, the man on the\nstreet, and the well-informed citizen (to whom it falls to determine\nwhich experts are competent). Schutz delineates various zones of\ninterests, or relevances, extending from those within reach to those\nabsolutely irrelevant, comments on the constant changeability of\nrelevance configurations, and differentiates between relevances\nintrinsic to a theme, which one chooses, and those imposed.\nParadoxically, as modernity\u2019s rationalization processes heighten\nanonymity, modern technology also brings everyone within reach, as the\nnuclear arms race demonstrates, and Schutz suggests as a solution that\ncitizens become broadly informed rather than succumb to the narrow\ndogmatism of the man on the street or the short-sighted specialization\nof experts. In becoming well-informed, one depends on knowledge\nsocially derived through the consultation of eyewitnesses, insiders,\nanalysts, and commentators, depending on their access to facts and\ngoverning relevances, much as Alvin Goldman\u2019s social\nepistemology involves appraising the \u2018veritistic\u2019 value of\nassorted agents\u2019 claims and practices. Schutz, usually the\nvalue-free describer of social reality, in his conclusion endorses a\nnormative notion of democracy in which it is a duty and a privilege,\nfrequently not available in non-democratic societies, for\nwell-informed citizens to express and defend opinions that often\nconflict with the uninformed opinions of the man in the street.\n\nSchutz composed \u201cEquality and the Meaning Structure of the\nSocial World\u201d at the time of the legal decision of Brown v.\nBoard of Education that ended racially segregated education in\nthe United States. With typical dispassion, Schutz explains how the\nmeaning of the term \u201cequality\u201d depends on the domain of\nrelevances to which it pertains (e.g., economic equality, equality of\ncivil rights, etc.) and on the in-group or out-group utilizing\nit\u2014and here he conceives interpretation in terms of groups\nrather than individuals. He spends most of the essay contrasting\nsubjective and objective interpretations of group membership,\nequality, and equality of opportunity, construing\n\u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d in terms of\nin-group and out-group interpretations. As regards group membership,\nhe illustrates that the mere categorization of another as a member of\na group need not be discriminatory, but depends upon an appropriate\nevaluation of the category from the viewpoint of the categorized\nindividual. In-groups and out-groups differ in whether they understand\nequality merely as \u201cformal,\u201d i.e., as nondiscrimination,\nor \u201creal,\u201d calling for special rights and services.\nSimilarly groups think of equality of opportunity from an out-group\nperspective as \u201cthe career open to all\u201d without\nappreciating how in-group members might subjectively experience\ninsuperable obstacles in trying to avail themselves of opportunities\nsupposedly objectively equal. In this essay, Schutz is concerned not\nto present a final definition of equality, but to highlight the\ndifferences between in-group and out-group understandings that serve\nas the preconditions of any discussion about it.\n\nSome recently published texts that Schutz authored during an ethics\ninstitute in 1956 make possible an even richer awareness of his views\non politics. In these documents, he recognizes the complex, unforeseen\nconsequences resulting from social change, urges active engagement\nwith others as crucial for developing social and civil judgment, and\nexamines the barriers to sound civil judgment created by government,\npolitical parties, pressure organizations, mass media, and\neducational, familial, religious, and professional institutions. At\none point, he even criticizes views that limit democracy to mere\nmajoritarian rule insofar as they neglect the importance of the single\nindividual\u2019s ability \u201cto make his personal opinion be\nheard and appreciated,\u201d preferably in smaller publics, such as\nfamilies, schools, local communities (cited in L. Embree 1999, 271).\nOne could take Schutz\u2019s thoughts here to converge with political\ntheories favoring what is today known as deliberative democracy.\nMoreover, his normative judgment against implementations of democracy\nthat increase the anonymity of citizens suggests that a parallel\nnormative, even ethical, dimension informs his many theoretic\nendeavors to retrieve from anonymity the neglected subjective\nviewpoint of actors, whether strangers, homecomers, victims of\ndiscrimination, or the \u201cforgotten man\u201d of social\nsciences.\n",
