    "main_text": "Other non-standard cosmologies || The multiverse\n5.2 The multiverse\n\nThe modern idea of the multiverse is theologically more controversial.\nIn its so-called landscape version, which since 2002 has been promoted\nand developed by Leonard Susskind and many other physicists, it is\nbased on the apparent non-uniqueness of the equations of string\ntheory. The solutions of the equations describe, in a sense, possible\nworlds with different physical parameters, interactions, types of\nparticles, and even dimensionality; the multitude of solutions are\nthen identified with really existing worlds which generally are\ncausally separate from ours. As a mechanism for generating the huge\nnumber of universes, multiverse physicists make use of the eternal\ninflation scenario. Moreover, the multiverse is closely associated\nwith anthropic reasoning: we find ourselves in our universe, with its\nparticular physical laws and content of particles, not because other\nuniverses are impossible or improbable, but because our kind of life\ncannot exist in other universes. The theory of the multiverse has\nseductively great explanatory power (while it has almost no predictive\npower), which is a major reason why many physicists and cosmologists\nfind it attractive. On the other hand, other physicists dismiss it as\npseudoscience because it is practically untestable.\n\nIt is common among supporters of the multiverse to conceive it as an\nalternative to a divinely created world and ideas of natural theology.\nBecause it represents our universe as a chance universe, special only\nby the fact that we live in it, the multiverse has been likened to\nanother and more famous anti-design theory, neo-Darwinianism. Weinberg\nputs it as follows: \u201cJust as Darwin and Wallace explained how\nthe wonderful adaption of living forms could arise without\nsupernatural intervention, so the string landscape may explain how the\nconstants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life\nwithout being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator\u201d (Weinberg\n2007, 39). At least to some theists, the multiverse stands in sharp\ncontrast to Christian belief. As Richard Swinburne sees it, \u201cTo\npostulate a trillion trillion other universes, rather than one God in\norder to explain the orderliness of our universe, seems the height of\nirrationality\u201d (Swinburne 1996, 68).\n\nSwinburne joins several other philosophers and physicists in seeing\nphysical cosmology as providing key data for a new design argument.\nThe strength of such\n fine-tuning\n arguments continues to be a hotly contested issue among philosophers\n(see Collins 2009, Colyvan et al. 2005, McGrew et al. 2001, White\n2000).\n\nOn the other hand, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the\nmultiverse and belief in a divine creator. Several philosophers have\nargued that if theism is true, we should expect the actual world to be\na multiverse: being a perfect being, God would create a multiverse\nrather than just a single universe (Kraay 2010). It is possible to\nanswer affirmatively to the question, \u201cdoes God love the\nmultiverse?\u201d, such as the physicist Don Page did at a symposium\nin 2008 (see Page 2008). Even if there are 10500\nuniverses (but not, perhaps, if\nthere are an infinite number of them), they could have been\nprovidentially created by the almighty God with a purpose we cannot\nfathom. Why not? It has even been suggested (by Paul Davies) that\nmultiverse explanations are reminiscent of divine explanations and\nunintentionally reintroduce a transcendent creator.\n\nMormon theology differs in several respects drastically from the\ntheology of traditional Christianity. Not only is God personal and\nheld to have been created by a prior god (who was again created by a\nprior god, etc.), according to the central doctrine of \u201ceternal\nprogression\u201d human beings will ultimately become like God\nhimself. There is an infinite number of beings and it takes an\neternity for them to become gods. Standard big bang cosmology, based\nas it is on a universe of finite age, is incompatible with Mormonism,\nwhere existence has neither beginning nor end. Whereas traditional\ntheologians have no problem with a universe created ex\nnihilo, and many subscribe to this doctrine, Mormons flatly\nreject it. In order to overcome the conflict with physical cosmology,\nsome Mormon thinkers have turned to the multiverse. Realizing that the\nattempt to harmonize the Mormon dogma of eternal progression with\nmodern cosmology is problematic, Kirk Hagen says: \u201cFor\nMormonism, a compelling reason to consider a multiverse cosmology is\nto attempt a reconciliation of modern cosmological ideas and the\ncentral tenet of Mormon doctrine\u201d (Hagen 2006, 28).\n\nThe anthropic principle, an integral part of multiverse cosmology, has\nsimilarly been discussed in theological contexts and, again similarly,\nwithout any consensus emerging from the many discussions. In its most\ncommon version, called the weak anthropic principle, it states that\nwhat we observe is selected by our existence in a universe with just\nsuch properties that allow us to exist. Swinburne and some other\ntheists in favor of design arguments find the anthropic principle to\nbe, at best, unnecessary and obfuscating. To them, the values of the\ncosmic parameters and constants of nature appear to be fine-tuned\nbecause they are fine-tuned, the designer being God. The atheist\nRichard Dawkins goes further, arguing that the anthropic principle is\nan alternative to the design hypothesis and provides strong evidence\nfor a world without God. However, theists do not generally see\nanthropically based arguments as a problem for a divinely created\nworld. William Lane Craig and John Polkinghorne are among those who\nhold that the anthropic principle is compatible with divine design and\ncan even be seen as indirect support for theism. According to the\nSouth-African cosmologist (and Quaker) George Ellis, anthropic\nfine-tuning is the result of a purposeful design of the universe. He\nhas suggested a \u201cChristian anthropic principle\u201d as the\nbasis for an ultimate understanding of the universe that combines\nscientific and religious perspectives (Ellis 1993).\n\nIn relation to the design argument, as reinvigorated by the\ndiscussions of the anthropic principle, some physicists and\nphilosophers have returned to an old objection to it, namely that it\nis not an argument for the Christian God; it is at best an\nargument for a cosmic architect in a deistic sense, or for that matter\nseveral such architects. On the other hand, theists have replied that\neven if this objection be true it does not constitute a proof that the\nGod of theism does not exist. Although design arguments frequently\noccur in connection with the anthropic principle, it needs to be said\nthat they were not part of the original anthropic program initiated by\nBrandon Carter in 1974.\n",
