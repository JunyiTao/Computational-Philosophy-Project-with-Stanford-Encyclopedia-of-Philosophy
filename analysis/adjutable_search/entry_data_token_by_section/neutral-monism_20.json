    "main_text": "Objections to Neutral Monism || Error\n4.7 Error\n\nThe neutral monism of Mach and James is committed to a naively\nrealistic account of perception according to which our perceptual\nexperiences and the aspects of the world perceived are one and the\nsame. Nonveridical experiences\u2014illusions, hallucinations,\ndreams, etc.\u2014are difficult to accommodate within such a picture.\nFor in cases of nonveridical experience\u2014e.g. when a drunkard\n\u201csees\u201d a pink rat\u2014we are inclined to say that the\nworld does not contain the relevant entities.\n\nBut traditional neutral monism provides an ontology rich enough to\naddress this problem. The pink patch experienced by the drunkard\nexists: it is a portion of pure experience (James), or an element\n(Mach). This much na\u00efve realism is true, even in the cases of\nnonveridical experience. But the pink rat that the drunkard\ntakes himself to see does not exist\u2014the pink patch he sees is\nnot a member of a group of neutral elements constituting a material\nobject such as a rat. There is nothing wrong with the drunkard\u2019s\nvisual experience; what is mistaken is his assumption about how what\nhe sees is connected with the rest of the world. Russell (though not a\nna\u00efve realist himself) states this point most succinctly:\n\u201cThere are in fact no illusions of the senses, but only mistakes\nin interpreting sensational data as signs of things other than\nthemselves\u201d (Russell 1948: 149\u201350). Mach puts the point as\nfollows:\n\nWhen we consider elements like red, green, hot, cold and the rest,\nwhich are physical and mental in virtue of their dependence on both\nexternal and internal circumstances, and are in both respects\nimmediately given and identical, the question as to illusion and\nreality loses its sense. Here we are simultaneously confronted by the\nelements of the real world and of the ego. The only possible further\nquestion of interest concerns their functional\ninterdependence\u2026. (Mach 1905: 7\u20138)\n\n",
