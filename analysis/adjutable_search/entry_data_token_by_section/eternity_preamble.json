    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201ceternity\u201d plays a key role in discussions about\nhow the God of Western theism relates to time. These discussions have\na long and venerable history. They are also of lively contemporary\ninterest.\n\nThe reason for this long-standing and continued interest is\nstraightforward. How one sees God\u2019s relationship to time has\nrepercussions throughout philosophy of religion and philosophical\ntheology. How much and in what ways does God\u2019s relationship to\ntime, and thus his nature, differ from ours? How much can meaningfully\nbe said about what God is like, as opposed to how God is not? How, if\nat all, can an unchanging God interact with the world, affect history,\nor respond to petitionary prayer? And even, how should one think of\nthe relation between science and theistic religion; can empirical\nfindings (dis-) confirm theism? Thus, a conception of how God relates\nto time is a defining element of any conception of God.\n\nThis entry provides an overview of some key positions on God and time\nand discusses arguments for and against divine timelessness. The final\nsection outlines some other philosophical contexts in which\nthe concept of eternity can play a role.\n",
