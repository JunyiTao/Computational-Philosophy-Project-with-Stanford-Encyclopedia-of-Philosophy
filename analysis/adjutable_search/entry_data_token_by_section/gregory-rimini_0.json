    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nBiographical information for much of the life of Gregory of Rimini\n(a.k.a. de Arimino, Ariminensis, the \u201cTorturer of\nInfants,\u201d the Lucerna splendens, and the\nDoctor acutus or authenticus) derives from\na letter of Pope Clement VI, dated 12 January 1345, requesting\nGregory\u2019s promotion to Master of Theology at the University of\nParis:\n\nGregory of Rimini, of the Order of the Friars Hermits of Saint\nAugustine, Parisian bachelor of theology, has now studied for\ntwenty-two years, namely six straight years at Paris, and afterwards,\nreturning to his native soil, he held the main chair at Bologna,\nPadua, and Perugia, and it has now been four years since he returned\nto Paris to lecture on the Sentences, lectures he has\ncompleted there commendably (Delucca 2003, 50).\n\n\nAccording to the letter, then, Gregory first studied theology at Paris\nfrom 1322 or 1323 until 1328 or 1329. Working backwards, we can\nestimate that Gregory was born in Rimini around 1300, joined the\nmendicant order of the Hermits of Saint Augustine (OESA), and received\nhis basic education before going to Paris. There he was exposed to the\nlatest developments in philosophical theology, especially the ideas of\nthe Franciscan Peter Auriol, who had died in early 1322. Assuming that\nthe sequence in the papal letter is strictly chronological, Gregory\nthen taught theology at various Augustinian studia in Italy,\nfirst at Bologna, where he is attested as lector in documents\nof late 1332, 1333, and early 1337. Perhaps he was transferred to\nPadua at the Augustinians\u2019 General Chapter meeting in Siena in\n1338, and then he was shifted to Perugia. Almost certainly while he\nwas in Italy, Gregory came into contact with the works of Oxford\nscholars from the 1320s and 1330s, most notably William of Ockham,\nAdam Wodeham, Richard Fitzralph, and Walter Chatton. Pope\nClement\u2019s letter suggests that Gregory returned to Paris in late\n1340 or in 1341 in order to lecture on the Sentences, but\nperhaps the \u201cfour years\u201d refers to the date of his\norder\u2019s General Chapter of Montpellier, 1341, which may have\nbeen the occasion when Gregory was assigned to return to Paris. The\nprevailing view is that Gregory went to Paris in 1342 for a year of\npreparation for his lectures on the Sentences, which were\ngiven in 1343\u201344, but given that our records of these lectures\nwere subject to revision, there is a degree of uncertainty. With help\nfrom the pope\u2019s letter, Gregory probably became Master of\nTheology in 1345, holding at least one quodlibetal disputation at\nParis, but he continued to revise his written Sentences\ncommentary until 1346, removing certain passages that were formerly\nconsidered later additiones. In late 1346 Master Gregory was\nin Rimini and the following year we find him teaching again in Padua,\nwhere he stayed until 1351 when the General Chapter at Basel sent him\nto teach at the recently established studium in Rimini. He\nremained there at least until late 1356, but on 20 May 1357, at the\nGeneral Chapter in Montpellier, he was elected the Augustinians\u2019\nprior general, succeeding the late Thomas of Strasbourg. Gregory died\nin Vienna toward the end of 1358 (see V. Marcolino\u2019s chapter in\nOberman 1981, 127\u201394; Lambertini et al. 2002; Delucca 2003).\n\nGregory\u2019s most important writing by far is his commentary on the\nfirst two books of the Sentences. Book I survives in some\ntwenty complete manuscripts, while there are about a dozen for book\nII. The work was printed several times from 1482 to 1532, reprinted in\n1955, and finally received a modern critical edition in six volumes in\n1979\u201384 (Rimini 1979\u201384; Bermon 2002). Parts have been or\nare being translated into French, German, and English. The status of\nBooks III and IV is unclear. It has been argued that they never\nexisted and that Gregory chose not to comment on them (Bermon 2002,\n274; Mandarella 2016, 198). However, Gregory explicitly says that he\nwill defer the treatment of certain questions to Book III (Girard\n2017, 241). In addition to scriptural commentaries, smaller writings\nhave been ascribed to Gregory, including a work usually known as\nDe usura, printed in 1508 and again in 1622 (see below,\nsection 6), and some tabulae of Augustine\u2019s works (see\nBermon 2007, 24\u201325 and Bermon forthcoming). His tract on the intension\nand remission of forms, De intensione et remissione formarum\ncorporalium, carries the incipit \u201cCirca secundum partem\nhuius distinctionis\u201d and is, therefore, just an excerpt of the\nSentences commentary, book I, distinction 17, part 2 (see\nLoewe 2014, 274). Finally, from his brief term as his order\u2019s\nprior general we have his correspondence, which has been published\n(Rimini 1976).\n",
