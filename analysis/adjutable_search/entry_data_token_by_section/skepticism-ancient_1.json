    "main_text": "Skeptical Ideas in Early and Classical Greek Philosophy || Early Greek Philosophy\n2.1 Early Greek Philosophy\n\nThe early Greek philosophers develop distinctions between reality and\nappearances, knowledge and belief, and the non-evident and the\nevident. These distinctions form the framework in which skepticism can\nbe conceived. The idea that truth is seen and knowledge gained from\nsome perspective outside of the ordinary ways of mortal life, and that\nmortals rely on something lesser, be it the hear-say of fame, or\nsigns, or appearances, runs through much of early Greek thought.\nHowever, few early Greek thinkers seem to have had skeptical or\nproto-skeptical inclinations. Xenophanes and Democritus are perhaps\nthe most prominent apparent exceptions.\n\nXenophanes famously insists that all conceptions of the gods are\nanthropomorphic and culturally contingent (DK 21B14, B15). The\nEthiopians pray to gods who look like Ethiopians, the Thracians to\ngods who look like Thracians (B16). If horses and cows had hands, the\nhorses would draw pictures of gods that look like horses, and the cows\nwould draw gods as cows (B15). Xenophanes puts forward a number of\ntheological theses of his own. But he says that no man will know the\nclear truth about such matters. He makes a point that has lasting\nrelevance in discussions of skepticism: even if someone succeeded in\nsaying something that actually is the case, he himself would not know\nthis. Thus, all is belief (120: B34) (cf. Sassi 2011 on\ninterpretations of Xenophanes that influence the history of\nskepticism).\n\nAtomism\u2014a theory which thrives in Hellenistic times as the\nphysical theory of Epicureanism, and is thus an interlocutor of\nskepticism\u2014leads into difficult epistemological questions. The\natomist can argue that sense perceptions are explicable as complex\nevents, initiated by objects each one made up of a lot of atoms\nfloating in the void, from which atoms proceed and traverse the\nintervening space, and affect the senses. It is certain objects, made\nup by the atoms proceeding from the objects in question (filmy images)\nthat we actually perceive. We neither perceive \u2018real\nreality\u2019 (atoms and void), nor even macroscopic objects and\ntheir properties (for example, a square tower). Democritus seems to\nhave argued along these lines (SE M 7.135\u20139; cf. fr. 9,\nSE M 7.136; Theophrastus, De Sensibus 2.60\u20131,\n63\u20134), and accordingly his atomist view of perception can be\nseen as grounding a kind of proto-skepticism.\n\nDemocritus\u2019 student Metrodorus of Chios says at the beginning of\nhis book On Nature \u201cNone of us knows anything, not even\nthis, whether we know or we do not know; nor do we know what \u2018to\nnot know\u2019 or \u2018to know\u2019 are, nor on the whole,\nwhether anything is or is not\u201d (Cicero, Acad. 2.73;\ntrans. Lee (2010) = DK 70B1; SE M 7.48, 87\u20138; Eusebius,\nPraep. evang. 14.19.9). This formulation reflects awareness\nof the fact that a simpler statement than the one reported in Cicero,\nsuch as \u201cthere is no knowledge,\u201d can be turned against\nitself. In particular, Metrodorus recognizes the role that\nunderstanding concepts plays in any such statement. Does its proponent\nknow something, merely by virtue of understanding what the terms she\nuses in her philosophizing refer to? Sextus presents Metrodorus\u2019\npronouncement as related to an enigmatic idea that he ascribes to two\nother philosophers, the Democritean Anaxarchus of Abdera and the Cynic\nMonismus (SE M 7.87\u201388). Both are said to have likened existing\nthings to a stage-painting. This comparison, which Burnyeat captures\nin the catch-phrase \u201call the world\u2019s a\nstage-painting,\u201d is open to a range of interpretations (Burnyeat\n2017). For Monismus, Burnyeat argues, it is likely to have had a\nmoralistic upshot, along the lines of \u201call is vanity.\u201d In\nDemocritean philosophy, and insofar as later skepticism recalls the\nsaying, it is bound to be a proposal in epistemology (or possibly\nepistemology and metaphysics).\n\nThe 5th century sophists develop forms of debate which are\nancestors of skeptical argumentation (Bett 2020b). They take pride in\narguing in a persuasive fashion for both sides of an issue and\nin developing an agonistic art of refuting any claim put forward.\nFurther, the sophists are interested in the contrast between nature\nand convention. The formative roles of custom and law were discussed\nby some of the earliest Greek authors (consider Pindar\u2019s\n\u201claw is king\u201d and its many interpretations, for example in\nHerodotus). The sophists explore the idea that, if things are\ndifferent for different cultures, there may be no fact of the matter\nof how those things really are. The skeptics engage with both legs of\nthe distinction between nature and convention. Pyrrhonian skepticism\nemploys an argument to the effect that, if something is by nature\nF, it is F for everyone (affects everyone as\nF) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Pyrrhonism further associates\nconvention with appearances, so that the sceptic, by adhering to\nappearances, can lead an ordinary life (see section 4). However, the\ncontrast between nature and convention does not figure importantly in\nancient skepticism, and there is no skeptical school that would\nconfine itself to \u2018moral\u2019 skepticism, or skepticism about\nvalues.\n\nSextus Empiricus, whose writings provide the most detailed extant\naccount of Pyrrhonian skepticism, emphasizes how strongly the skeptics\ndepart from all other philosophers. As he presents it, the\nPre-Socratics who put forward some of the views cited above are what\nhe calls dogmatists. They make claims about nature, reality,\nknowability, and so on. The second-most detailed extant account of\nPyrrhonian skepticism is offered by Diogenes Laertius, in his\nLives of Eminent Philosophers 9.61\u2013116. It contains a\nlarge number of references to early Greek poets and Pre-Socratic\nphilosophers, suggesting that these early thinkers formulate ideas\nthat are similar to skeptic ideas (\u00a7\u00a761\u201373). It is\ncontroversial whether the skeptics Diogenes has in mind claim this\nancestry. Alternatively, other philosophers may have charged the\nskeptics with sharing ideas with non-skeptical thinkers, thereby\ndeparting from their non-dogmatic approach (Warren 2015). Either way,\ntwo observations seem relevant. Contrary to a classic assessment of\nDiogenes\u2019 report by Jonathan Barnes (1992), the sections of text\nin which connections are made between early Greek thought and\nskepticism may be worth exploring. Moreover, scholars may have paid\ntoo little attention to skepticism\u2019s ancestry in poetry (Clayman\n2009). Pyrrho seems to have referred to Homer as a proponent of ideas\nhe approves of, ideas about change, the status of human rationality\nand language, and more.\n",
