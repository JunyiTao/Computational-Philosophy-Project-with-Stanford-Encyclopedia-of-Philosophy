    "main_text": "Philosophy of Dialogue: I and Thou\n4. Philosophy of Dialogue: I and Thou\n\n\nBuber\u2019s best-known work is the short philosophical essay I and\nThou (1923), the basic tenets of which he was to modify, but never\nto abandon. In this work, Buber gives expression to the intuition that\nwe need to withstand the temptation to reduce human relations to the\nsimple either/or of Apollonian or Dionysian, rational or romantic\nways of relating to others. We are beings that can enter into dialogic\nrelations not just with human others but with other animate beings,\nsuch as animals, or a tree, as well as with the Divine Thou. The\nduality of relations and, at its extreme, their coincidence, may serve\nas the key to Buber\u2019s mature thought on everything from his\napproach to biblical faith to his practical politics in matters of\nJewish-Arab relations in Palestine. I and Thou was first\ntranslated into English in 1937 by Ronald Gregor Smith and later again\nby Walter Kaufmann. The German original was an instant classic and remains in print today. In the 1950s and 60s, when Buber first traveled\nand lectured in the USA, the essay became popular in the\nEnglish-speaking world as well.\n\n\nWhereas before World War I Buber had promoted an aesthetic of unity\nand unification, his later writings embrace a rougher and more\nelemental dualism. Buber always opposed philosophical monism, which he\nidentified with Bergson, and objected to \u201cdoctrines of\nimmersion,\u201d which he identified with Buddhism. Complicating the\nundifferentiated shape of mystical experience (as sought by the\nmedievals, including Eckhart, as an annihilation of self), the\nprofoundly dualistic world-view proffered in I and Thou\nreferences Cusa\u2019s coincidentia oppositorum as an\nexpression of human limits. Buber\u2019s text reduces the relation\nbetween persons, animate objects, and deity to three expressive\nsignifiers: \u201cI\u201d, \u201cYou\u201d, and \u201cIt\u201d. \nThey are the elemental variables whose\ncombination and re-combination structure all experience as relational.\nThe individuated elements realize themselves in relations, forming\npatterns that burst into life, grow, vanish, and revive. Human\ninter-subjectivity affirms the polymorphous I-Thou encounter.\nResting upon the claim that no isolated I exists apart\nfrom relationship to an other, dialogue or \u201cencounter\u201d\ntransforms each figure into an ultimate and mysterious center of value\nwhose presence eludes the concepts of instrumental language. The\nheteronomous revelation of a singular presence calls the subject into\nan open-ended relationship, a living pattern, that defies sense, logic,\nand proportion; whereas the I-It relationship, in its most\ndegenerate stage, assumes the fixed form of objects that one can measure and manipulate.\nAt the core of this model of existence is the notion of encounter as\n\u201crevelation.\u201d As understood by Buber, revelation is the\nrevelation of \u201cpresence\u201d (Gegenwart). In contrast\nto \u201cobject\u201d (Gegenstand), the presence revealed by\nrevelation as encounter occupies the space \u201cin between\u201d the\nsubject and an other (a tree, a person, a work of art, God). This\n\u201cin between\u201d space is defined as \u201cmutual\u201d\n(gegenseitig). Contrasting with the Kantian concept of\nexperience (Erfahrung), Erlebnis (encounter), or\nrevelation of sheer presence, is an ineffable, pure form that carries\nnot an iota of determinate or object-like conceptual or linguistic\ncontent. Buber always insisted that the dialogic principle, i.e., the\nduality of primal words (Urworte) that he called the\nI-Thou and the I-It, was not an abstract conception\nbut an ontological reality that he pointed to but that could not be\nproperly represented in discursive prose.\n\n\nThe confusion (and/or con-fusion) between philosophy and religion is\nespecially marked in I and Thou. While Buber seems to lack a\nfully worked-out epistemology and occasionally revels in paradoxes that\nborder on mystical theology, it has been argued that Buber did indeed\nsolve the inherent \u201cdifficulty of dialogics that it reflects on,\nand speaks of, a human reality about which, in his own words, one\ncannot think and speak in an appropriate manner\u201d (Bloch [1983] p.\n62). Debates about the strength and weakness of I and Thou as\nthe foundation of a system hinge, in part, on the assumption that the\nfive-volume project, to which this book was to serve as a prolegomenon\n(a project Buber abandoned), was indeed a philosophical one.\nBuber\u2019s lectures at the Freies j\u00fcdisches Lehrhaus\nand his courses at University of Frankfurt, as well as letters to\nRosenzweig show that, at the time of its writing, he was preoccupied\nwith a new approach to the phenomenology of religion (cf. Schottroff,\nZank). In Buber\u2019s cyclical conception of the history of\nreligions, the revelation of presence mixes into and animates the\nliving and lived forms of historical religion (institutions, texts,\nrituals, images, and ideas), becoming over time ossified and rigid and\nobject-like, but structurally open to the force of renewal based on new\nforms of encounter as revelation. The history of religion as described\nby Buber in the closing words of I and Thou is a contracting,\nintensifying spiral figure that has redemption as its telos. It would\nbe artificial, however, to separate Buber\u2019s interest in religious\nphenomena from his interest in a general philosophical anthropology.\nRather, Buber seems to have tried to find one in the other,\nor\u2014put differently\u2014to make religious belief and practice\nperspicacious in light of a general philosophical anthropology.\n",
