The Concept of a Nonexistent Object\n\nThe very concept of a \u201cnonexistent object\u201d has an air of\nparadox about it, at least for those philosophers whose thinking is\nrooted in the Humean tradition. For Hume suggested that to think of an\nobject is always and necessarily to think of an existent\nobject, or to put it differently, that to think of an object and to\nthink of the same object as existing are just one and the same thing.\nImmanuel Kant took up Hume\u2019s idea and claimed that existence is\nnot a \u201creal predicate\u201d, a claim that is often interpreted\nas an anticipation of Gottlob Frege\u2019s famous doctrine that\nexistence is not a predicate of individuals. (See Hume 2000, Book 1,\nPart 2, Sect. 6; Kant 2003, B 627; Frege 1966, pp. 37f.) Kant\u2019s\nmotivation for rejecting the view that existence is a \u201creal\npredicate\u201d was the so-called \u201contological proof\u201d of\nGod\u2019s existence, which says, roughly, that God\u2019s\nperfection entails God\u2019s existence, since a being that would\nhave all of God\u2019s perfections except existence (i.e.,\nomniscience, omnipotence, benevolence) would be less perfect than a\nbeing with the same perfections plus existence. For centuries,\nphilosophers have felt that there is something wrong with this proof,\nbut Kant was the first one who was able to point out a possible error:\nhe argued that the mistake of the \u201contological argument\u201d\nlies in the treatment of existence as a \u201creal\npredicate\u201d.\n\nIf Hume is right, then the concept of an object includes the concept\nof existence, and the concept of a nonexistent object would be as\nself-contradictory as the concept of a round square. If existence is\nnot a predicate of individuals, then one might suppose that neither is\nnonexistence. Therefore, if Frege is right, to say of an object that\nit is nonexistent is a kind of nonsense that arises from a violation\nof logical grammar. (For Frege and those who follow him, a claim like\n\u201cGod exists/does not exist\u201d is to be understood as a claim\nabout the concept God, or about the property of being God. On\nthis view, the logical form of \u201cGod exists\u201d is not\nExists (God)\u2014where Exists is a predicate of\nindividuals, but rather: The concept God applies to\nsomething, or Something possesses the property of being\nGod.)\n\nThus, in order to take the idea of nonexistent objects seriously, one\nhas to give up views held by important philosophers about the nature\nof existence and adopt the view that existence is some kind of\npredicate of individuals. This view entails, among other things, that\nto say, for instance, that some white elephants exist is to say that\nsome white elephants have the property of existence (or, to put it the\nother way around, that not all white elephants are\nnonexistent)\u2014a consequence that might strike some as\nstrange.\n\nFurthermore, in order to assert \u201cthere are nonexistent\nobjects\u201d without implying \u201cnonexistent objects\nexist\u201d, one has to suppose that sentences of the form\n\u201cThere are \\(F\\)s\u201d mean something different from\nsentences of the form \u201c\\(F\\)s\n exist\u201d.[1]\n Some philosophers reject a distinction between \u201cthere is\u201d\nand \u201cexists\u201d (see, for instance, Lewis 1990, Priest 2005,\nQuine 1953), some philosophers (e.g., Meinong 1960, Parsons 1980,\nZalta 1988) think that there are good reasons for making this\ndistinction. Some of the latter think that the distinction between\n\u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d is rooted in ordinary\nlanguage, but others deny this firmly (see, for instance, Geach 1971).\nObviously, although there might be a tendency among competent English\nspeakers to use \u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d in\ndifferent contexts, ordinary language use is too wavering and\nnon-uniform in this respect to be a stable ground for a philosophical\ntheory. Of course, this does not rule out that there are\ntheoretical reasons for a distinction between \u201cthere\nis\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d, some of which are discussed\nbelow.\n1.1 The Logics of Nonexistent Objects\n\nIn those logics that stand in the Frege-Quine tradition, both\n\u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d are expressed by means\nof the \u201cexistential quantifier\u201d (\u201c\\(\\exists\\)\u201d),\nwhich is, consequently, interpreted as having \u201contological\nimport\u201d. Thus, in these formal systems, there is no means to\ndistinguish between \u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d.\nHowever, it has been shown that the distinction between the two can be\ncoherently regimented in various ways. In the systems of Terence\nParsons, Edward N. Zalta and Dale Jacquette, for instance,\n\u201cthere is an \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d is expressed by\n\u201c\\(\\exists x(\\ldots x\\ldots)\\)\u201d, whereas\n\u201cthere exists an \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d is expressed by\n\u201c\\(\\exists x\\rE !x \\amp \\ldots x\\ldots)\\)\u201d, where \u201cE!\u201d is the\nexistence predicate (Parsons 1980, Zalta 1983, Zalta 1988, Jacquette\n1996). \u201cSome things do not exist\u201d could thus be rendered\nin logical notation as follows:\n\u201c\\(\\exists x(\\neg\\rE !x)\\)\u201d; \u201cPegasus\ndoes not exist\u201d as \u201c\\(\\neg\\rE !p\\)\u201d; and so\nforth.\n\nGraham Priest (2005) has proposed a theory of nonexistent objects that\ntreats \u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d as synonyms. He\ninterprets quantification as utterly ontologically neutral. The\nquantifier should express neither \u201cthere is\u201d nor\n\u201cthere exists\u201d. Rather, quantifier expressions should be\nread \u201cFor some \\(x, \\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d,\nwhere \u201cFor some \\(x, \\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d\ndoes not imply that \u201cthere is (or exists) an \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\ldots x\\ldots\\)\u201d.\n\nThus, Priest belongs to those philosophers who distinguish between\n\u201cquantifier commitment\u201d and \u201contological\ncommitment\u201d (see Azzouni 2004), claiming that to\n\u201cquantifier over\u201d objects of a certain kind does not\nentail an ontological commitment to objects of this\n kind.[2]\n\nThe various logics of nonexistent objects cannot be described and\ndiscussed here in detail. However, it is now clear that there is no\nformal obstacle to a theory of nonexistent objects. The only\nquestions are philosophical: can the concepts that such theories aim\nto formalize be explained, and do we have good reason to accept a\ntheory formulated in these terms? In the following two sections, the\nmain motivations for believing in nonexistent objects are\ndelineated.\n2. Historical Roots: Alexius Meinong and the Problem of Intentionality\n\nPhilosophical writings on nonexistent objects in the 20th and 21st\ncentury usually take as their starting point the so-called\n\u201ctheory of objects\u201d of the Austrian philosopher Alexius\nMeinong (1853\u20131920). Therefore, it is appropriate to give an\noutline of the basic principles of and motives behind this theory.\n(For a detailed presentation see the entry on\n Meinong.)\n\nMeinong was concerned about the problem of intentional states which\nare not directed at anything existent. The starting point of this\nproblem is the so-called \u201cprinciple of intentionality\u201d,\nwhich says that mental phenomena are characterized by an\n\u201cintentional directedness\u201d towards an object. For\ninstance, to love is always to love something, to imagine is always to\nimagine something, and so forth. In other words, every intentional act\nis \u201cabout\u201d something. The problem is that sometimes people\nimagine, desire or fear things that do not exist. Some people fear the\ndevil, although the devil doesn\u2019t exist. Many people hope for\npeace in the Middle East. But there is no peace in the Middle East.\nPonce the Leon searched for the fountain of youth, even though it\ndoesn\u2019t exist. It is easy to imagine a golden mountain, even if\nno such thing exists.\n\nCases like these seem to be clear counterexamples to the principle of\nintentionality. However, many philosophers found this principle too\nappealing to be given up completely. While some came to the conclusion\nthat intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not\nrequire the existence of an object (see, for instance, Brentano 1874,\nPrior 1971, Searle 1983, Crane 2013), Meinong offered another\nsolution: there is indeed an object for every mental state\nwhatsoever\u2014if not an existent object then at least a nonexistent\n one.[3]\n\nThe problem of intentionality may still count as one of the most\nimportant motivations for thinking there are nonexistent\n objects.[4]\n But there are other motivations as well.\n3. Further Motivations for Belief in Nonexistent Objects\n3.1 The Problem of Negative Singular Existence Statements\n\nVery briefly, the problem can be stated as follows: it seems that in\norder to deny the existence of a given individual, one must assume the\nexistence of that very individual. Thus, it seems that it is\nimpossible to deny the existence of an individual without getting\ninvolved in a contradiction.\n\nHowever, this conclusion seems hard to accept. In fact, there are many\nnegative existence statements that we take not only to be sensible but\nalso to be true (or at least not to be necessarily false). Consider,\nfor instance:\n\nPegasus does not exist.\nYugoslavia does not exist anymore.\nThe perpetual motion machine does not exist and never will exist.\n\n\nFrom the common sense point of view, negative singular existence\nstatements are ubiquitous, comprehensible and sometimes true. So why\nis it that many philosophers are so puzzled about them? In particular,\nwhy think one has to assume the existence of an individual in order to\ndeny its existence?\n\nOne traditional reason that has been given is based on the following\nassumptions:\n\nOnly meaningful sentences can be true.\nIn a meaningful sentence, every constituent of the sentence must\nbe meaningful.\nIf a singular term is meaningful, then it denotes something.\nIf a singular term \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d denotes something,\nthen \u201c\\(b\\) does not exist\u201d is false.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how these assumptions lead to a problem in light of\nthe negative singular existence sentence \u201cPegasus does not\nexist\u201d. If \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is true, then it\nmust be meaningful (by (1) above). If it is meaningful, all of its\nconstituents must be meaningful, including the singular term\n\u201cPegasus\u201d (by (2) above). If \u201cPegasus\u201d is\nmeaningful, then \u201cPegasus\u201d denotes something (by (3)\nabove). If \u201cPegasus\u201d denotes something, then\n\u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is false (by (4) above). Thus,\nthe assumption that \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is true leads\nto the conclusion that this same sentence is false. So if the above\npremises are correct, it is impossible that \u201cPegasus does not\nexist\u201d is true: either \u201cPegasus\u201d denotes something,\nin which case \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is false; or\n\u201cPegasus\u201d does not denote anything, in which case\n\u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is not even meaningful, let alone\ntrue.\n\nThere are several ways to resolve this problem, i.e., to account for\nmeaningful and true negative singular existence sentences. One\nsolution that became very prominent in the 20th century consists in\nthe strategy of \u201canalyzing away\u201d the proper names and\ndefinite descriptions appearing in negative singular existential\nclaims. This strategy consists of two steps:\n\nOrdinary proper names are interpreted as disguised definite\ndescriptions. For instance, \u201cPegasus\u201d is to be analyzed as\nshort for \u201cthe flying horse from Greek mythology\u201d. This is\noften called the description theory of proper names. Thus to\nsay \u201cPegasus exists\u201d is simply to say \u201cthe flying\nhorse of Greek mythology exists\u201d.\nDefinite descriptions are to be analyzed along the lines of\nBertrand Russell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions. On\nRussell\u2019s theory, to say \u201cthe flying horse of Greek\nmythology exists\u201d is to say \u201cthere is exactly one\n\\(x\\) which is a flying horse of Greek mythology\u201d.\n\n\nThus, combining these two steps, it follows that:\n\nTo say \u201cPegasus doesn\u2019t exist\u201d is to say\n\u201cit is not the case that there is exactly one \\(x\\) which\nis a flying horse of Greek\n mythology\u201d.[5]\n\n\nIf \u201cVulcan\u201d is short for \u201cthe planet between Mercury\nand the sun\u201d, then:\n\nTo say \u201cVulcan doesn\u2019t exist\u201d is to say\n\u201cit is not the case that there is exactly one \\(x\\) which\nis such that \\(x\\) is a planet between Mercury and the\nsun\u201d.\n\n\nThe point of these paraphrases is to show that the original sentences\ncan be analyzed in terms of sentences in which the singular terms\n(\u201cPegasus\u201d, \u201cVulcan\u201d, \u201cthe flying horse\nof Greek mythology\u201d and \u201cthe planet between Mercury and\nthe sun\u201d) have all disappeared. The paraphrases involve the\ngeneral terms \u201cflying horse from Greek mythology\u201d and\n\u201cplanet between Mercury and the sun\u201d, along with the\nexistential quantifier (\u201cthere is\u201d) and a uniqueness\ncondition (\u201cexactly one\u201d). (Let\u2019s ignore the fact\nthat the singular terms \u201cMercury\u201d and \u201cLe\nVerrier\u201d appear within the general terms; of course, this means\nthat the procedure isn\u2019t complete, but, in principle, it can be\ncompleted.) The problem of negative singular existentials is thereby\nresolved because sentences containing names which appear to be about\nnonexistent objects are paraphrased in terms of sentences involving\ngeneral terms, quantifiers and uniqueness conditions. These latter\nsentences are meaningful independently of whether the general terms\napply to anything.\n\nHowever, both the description theory of proper names and\nRussell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions have been subject to\nserious criticisms. One might object that they fail to do full justice\nto our actual use of proper names and definite descriptions. Often we\nuse proper names\u2014successfully\u2014without having any definite\ndescription in mind. Sometimes we don\u2019t need a definite\ndescription in order to refer to a particular object, because we\nindividuate the respective object by means of perception or perceptual\nmemories. Sometimes we simply do not know of a definite description\nthat individuates the object we wish to refer to. Most of us know\nabout Cicero just that he was a famous Roman orator; but the Romans\nhad more than one famous orator. Nevertheless, we can use the name\n\u201cCicero\u201d successfully to refer to a particular\nfamous Roman orator. Moreover, even when we do have something like the\nmental correlate of a definite description in mind when we use a\nproper name, we do not usually treat the description as a\ndefinition of the proper name (as the Russellian picture\nsuggests). Suppose what I have in mind when I use the name\n\u201cSocrates\u201d corresponds to the description \u201cthe\nancient Greek philosopher who died from drinking hemlock\u201d.\nSuppose furthermore that the famous story about Socrates\u2019 death\nis actually a myth and that Socrates in fact died peacefully of old\nage. Do I then simply fail to refer to Socrates whenever I use the\nname \u201cSocrates\u201d? It does not seem so. When I eventually\ncome to know that Socrates did not die from drinking hemlock, I will\ntake this as a piece of information about Socrates, the\nperson I referred to all the time by using the name\n\u201cSocrates\u201d. (See Kripke 1980.)\n\nAs to the theory of definite descriptions, two kinds of problem arise.\nFirst, some philosophers simply deny that the paraphrases properly\ncapture the meaning of sentences with definite descriptions, simply on\nthe grounds that the meaning of a proper name like\n\u201cPegasus\u201d is just less specific than the meaning of the\ndefinite description \u201cthe flying horse of Greek\nmythology\u201d. Second, some philosophers have objected that the\ntheory of definite descriptions sometimes yields the wrong results.\nConsider, for instance: \u201cThe ancient Greeks worshipped\nZeus.\u201d Prima facie, this sentence expresses a real\nrelation between the ancient Greeks and Zeus; and it is surely a\nhistorical fact that the ancient Greeks worshipped Zeus. Yet on\nRussell\u2019s analysis, proper names like \u201cZeus\u201d have to\nbe replaced by definite descriptions, even in contexts other than\nexistence claims. So \u201cZeus\u201d would get replaced by a\ndefinite description like \u201cthe Greek god who lived on Mt.\nOlympus and who \u2026\u201d. Thus, the above true sentence would\nget analyzed in terms of the following false one:\n\u201cThere exists one and only one Greek god who lived on Mt.\nOlympus and who \u2026 and who was such that the ancient Greeks\nworshipped him.\u201d There are numerous other true sentences like\nthis, such as \u201cSherlock Holmes is more famous than any real\ndetective\u201d, etc., all of which appear to involve real relations\nbetween existent objects and nonexistent ones, but whose Russellian\nparaphrases are false. Third, the use of the anaphoric pronoun\n\u201cit\u201d in \u201cTeams of scientists have searched for the\nLoch Ness monster, but since it doesn\u2019t exist, no one will ever\nfind it\u201d seems problematic. The pronoun in both of its\noccurrences in this sentence seems to pick up its meaning/denotation\nfrom the definite description \u201cthe Loch Ness\nmonster\u201d\u2014which is not easy to explain given\nRussell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions.\n\nThere might be ways to defend the theory of definite descriptions, but\nthey will not be pursued here. In the context of this article, the\nrelevant point is that Russell\u2019s theory does not provide a\ngenerally accepted solution to the problem of negative existence\nsentences. The appeal to nonexistent objects, on the other hand,\nprovides a very simple solution to this problem. It consists in\nrejecting the premise\n\nIf a singular term \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d denotes something,\nthen \u201c\\(b\\) does not exist\u201d is false.\n\n\nIf there are nonexistent objects, then \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d may\ndenote an object that does not exist.\n\nThe idea here is that whereas the quantifiers \u201cthere is\u201d\nand \u201csomething\u201d range over everything whatsoever, the\nobjects that exist constitute only a portion of that domain.\nTherefore, it would be fallacious to derive from\n\u201c\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 denotes something\u201d that\n\u201c\\(b\\)\u201d denotes something that exists.\nAccording to this picture, \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d simply\nexpresses that Pegasus is a nonexistent object. Premises 1\u20133\nfrom above can be accepted without restriction. \u201cPegasus\u201d\ndenotes a nonexistent flying horse and thus is meaningful. Thus, the\nwhole sentence \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is meaningful as\nwell. Since it is true that Pegasus does not belong to the class of\nexistent objects, \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d is true. Of\ncourse, this solution can be generalized to all negative singular\nexistence statements. The appeal to nonexistent objects thus supplies\nan elegant solution to the problem of negative singular\nexistentials.\n\nNaturally, there are alternative solutions to the problem of negative\nsingular existence statements. Among other things, it is possible to\nreject premise 4 without committing oneself to an ontology of\nnonexistent objects. One might simply accept a positive Free Logic,\ni.e., the conjunction of the following two principles: 1. Singular\nterms do not need to denote anything in order to be meaningful. 2.\nSentences containing non-denoting singular terms can be true. (This\nstrategy is to be found, for instance, in Crane 2013.) One of the\ndifficulties of this solution, however, is to give an account of what\nmakes such sentences true, i.e., of what their truthhmakers are (given\nthe principle that, for every true sentence, there is something in the\nworld that makes it true, i.e., something that is the sentence\u2019s\ntruthmaker). For the special case of negative singular existence\nsentences, one might claim that that their truthmaker is just the\nentire world (see, e.g., Crane 2013, Section 3.5; for more about\nCrane\u2019s position see Section 5.1 below). However, this answer to\nthe truthmaker question is not available for the problem of fictional\ndiscourse, which provides another important motivation for a\ncommitment to nonexistent objects.\n3.2 The Problem of Fictional Discourse\n\nBy \u201cfictional discourse\u201d we mean here and in what follows\ndiscourse about fictitious objects. Sometimes, the term\n\u201cfictitious object\u201d is used as synonymous with\n\u201cnonexistent object\u201d. Here, the term is used in a\ndifferent sense, namely for objects (characters, things, events etc.)\nwhich occur in fictions, i.e., in myths or fairy tales, in fictional\nnovels, movies, operas etc. Pegasus is a fictitious object in this\nsense (as are Sherlock Holmes and Hamlet) but Vulcan (the hypothetical\nplanet sought by Le Verrier) is not.\n\nConsider, for instance, the sentence\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nLike many other sentences of fictional discourse, it appears to\nfulfill the following three conditions:\n\nIt has the grammatical structure of a predication, i.e., the\nstructure that is rendered in logical notation by\n\u201c\\(Fb\\)\u201d (where \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d stands for a\npredicate expression\u2014here: \u201cis a flying\nhorse\u201d\u2014and \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d stands for a singular\nterm\u2014here: \u201cPegasus\u201d).\nThe singular term in subject position is a name for a fictitious\nobject.\nIt is commonly, and with good reason, taken to be true.\n\n\nThe problem of fictional discourse is closely connected to two logical\nprinciples. The first one is well known as \u201cthe principle of\nexistential generalization\u201d:\n\nExistential Generalization \\((\\mathbf{EG})\\):\n\n\\(Fb \\rightarrow \\exists x(Fx)\\), i.e.,\n\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then there is something that is\n \\(F\\).[6]\n\n\nThe second principle is less prominent, rather seldom explicitly\nstated, but often tacitly assumed. We call it \u201cthe predication\nprinciple\u201d:\n\nPredication Principle \\((\\mathbf{PP})\\):\n\n\\(Fb \\rightarrow \\exists x(x = b)\\).[7]\n\n\n(PP) may be read in two ways:\n\n(PPa)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then there is something that is\nidentical with \\(b\\).\n(PPb)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then \\(b\\) exists.\n\n\nBoth principles are prima facie extremely plausible: If it is\ntrue of some individual that the predicate \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d\napplies to it, then the predicate \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d\napplies to something. If some predicate\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d applies to an individual, then the individual\nhas to exist (for if it were otherwise, how could the predicate apply\nto it?).\n\nYet, when applied to fictional discourse, these two principles lead to\nconsequences that seem to contradict hard empirical facts on the one\nhand and trivial truths about the ontological status of fictitious\nobjects on the other. According to (EG), the sentence\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nimplies\n\n(2)\nThere are flying horses.\n\n\nYet, as we all know, there are no flying horses.\n\nAccording to (PP),\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nimplies\n\n(3)\nPegasus exists.\n\n\nBut Pegasus is a fictitious object; and it seems that to call an\nobject fictitious is just to say that it does not exist.\n\nThe problem is that obviously true sentences of fictional discourse\nseem to lead into outright contradictions. Of course, there are\nseveral ways to avoid the contradictions. One of them consists in\nrejecting the principles (EG) and (PP). By this move, one blocks the\ninference from \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d to \u201cThere\nare flying horses\u201d and \u201cPegasus exists\u201d. Indeed,\nsome logicians, notably proponents of Free Logics, take this path.\n(See Crane 2013, Hintikka 1959, Lambert 1983 and 1991, Leonard\n 1956.)[8]\n Again (as with the case of negative singular existence statements)\nthis raises the question of what the truthmakers of such sentences\nare. There are attempts to answer this question in a\n\u201creductionist\u201d fashion, i.e., to claim that sentences\nabout fictitious objects are made true not by fictitious objects but\nby something else, e.g., by literary works, myths, stories or facts\nabout these,\n respectively.[9]\n\nAnother way to avoid the contradictions would be simply to reject the\nsentence \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d (and, in general, all\nalleged predications about fictitious objects) as false or untrue.\nThis radical solution, however, fails to do justice to the widespread\nintuition that there is a difference in truth-value between\n\u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d and, say, \u201cPegasus is a\nflying dog\u201d.\n\nA third attempt to resolve the problem is what may be called\n\u201cthe story-operator strategy\u201d. According to the\nstory-operator strategy, we have to interpret sentences of fictional\ndiscourse as incomplete. A complete rendition of, for instance,\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nwould be as follows:\n\n(1\u2032)\nAccording to the story \\(S\\) (where\n\u201c\\(S\\)\u201d here and in what follows stands for the story\nof Greek mythology): Pegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nThe expression \u201caccording to the story \\(S\\)\u201d is the\nso-called \u201cstory\n operator\u201d,[10]\n which is a sentence operator (that is, it is the sentence as\na whole that is in its scope, not just a part of the sentence, for\ninstance the predicate). While the sentence within the scope of the\nstory operator (here: \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d) may be\nfalse when taken in isolation, the complete sentence may be true.\n(This strategy is developed in detail in K\u00fcnne 1990.)\n\nSentence (1\u2032) does not imply that there are flying\nhorses; neither does it imply that Pegasus exists. Thus, the\ncontradictions are\n avoided.[11]\n This looks like an elegant solution, at least as long as we confine\nourselves to a particular kind of example. Unfortunately, however, it\ndoes not work equally well for all kinds of sentences of fictional\ndiscourse. Consider, for instance:\n\n(4)\nPegasus is a character from Greek mythology.\n\n\nThis sentence seems to be straightforwardly true; but if we put a\nstory operator in front of it, we get a straightforward falsehood:\n\n(4\u2032)\nAccording to the story \\(S\\): Pegasus is a character\nfrom Greek mythology.\n\n\nIt is not true that according to the relevant story, Pegasus is a\ncharacter. Rather, according to this story, Pegasus is a living being\nof flesh and blood.\n\nOne may call sentences like \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d or\n\u201cHamlet hates his stepfather\u201d \u201cinternal\nsentences of fictional discourse\u201d, in distinction from\nexternal sentences of fictional discourse, like\n\u201cPegasus is a character from Greek mythology\u201d or\n\u201cHamlet has fascinated many psychoanalysts\u201d. The story\noperator strategy can be applied to internal sentences only and thus\nfails as a general solution to the problem of fictional\n discourse.[12]\n\nThe claim that there are nonexistent objects provides a solution that\ncan be applied uniformly both to internal and external sentences of\nfictional discourse. It allows us to admit that fictitious objects do\nnot exist but at the same time to acknowledge that there\nare fictitious objects. According to this position, fictitious\nobjects are just a species of nonexistent objects.\n\nIn order to see how this assumption is supposed to avoid the\ncontradictions spelled out above, consider:\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying\n horse.[13]\n(2)\nThere are flying horses. (1, EG)\n(3)\nThere are no flying horses.\n\n\nAccording to the Meinongian solution, premise 3 has to be rejected as\nfalse. The Meinongian grants that flying horses do not exist,\nbut this does not imply that there are no flying horses.\nAccording to the Meinongian, there are flying horses, and they belong\nto the class of nonexistent objects, and Pegasus is one of them.\nPremise 3 may be replaced by\n\n(3\u2032)\nFlying horses do not exist.\n\n\nBut this does not contradict\n\n(2)\nThere are flying horses.\n\n\nThus, the problem is\n solved.[14]\n\nConsider next:\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n(2)\nPegasus exists. (1, PP)\n(3)\nPegasus is a fictitious object.\n(4)\nFictitious objects do not exist.\n(5)\nPegasus doesn\u2019t exist. (3, 4)\n\n\nIn this case, the Meinongian solution consists in rejecting premise 2.\nThe Meinongian cannot accept 2, since Pegasus is supposed to be a\nnonexistent object.\n\nWhat, then, about the predication principle? Does the Meinongian have\nto reject it?\u2014Not necessarily. Remember that (PP) can be read in\n(at least) two ways:\n\n(PPa)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then there is something that is\nidentical with \\(b\\).\n(PPb)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then \\(b\\) exists.\n\n\nWithin the Meinongian framework, these two readings are not\nequivalent. According to the Meinongian, certainly there is something\nthat is identical with Pegasus, although Pegasus does not exist. Thus,\nthe Meinongian must reject the reading (PPb), but she can (and does)\naccept the reading\n (PPa).[15]\n\nSince the Meinongian accepts only the weaker version (PPa) of the\npredication principle, the inference from premise 1 (\u201cPegasus is\na flying horse\u201d) to \u201cPegasus exists\u201d is blocked. All\nthat can be derived from premise 1 is the weaker claim\n\n(2\u2032)\nThere is something that is identical with Pegasus.\n\n\nBut this is not in conflict with \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d.\nThus, the problem is resolved.\n\nAlternatively, one may abstain from the Meinongian distinction between\nbeing and existence and hold that fictitious objects are existent\nabstract objects. According to this position, \u201cPegasus does not\nexist\u201d has to be rejected as false, and thus, again, the\ncontradiction is avoided. This position (it might be called\n\u201cabstractionism with respect to fictitious objects\u201d) comes\nin two varieties. The first one might be characterized, in a somewhat\nsimplified fashion, as follows: To every set of properties, there\nis/exists a corresponding abstract object. These abstract objects\nexist necessarily. Some of them occur in fictional stories, and these\nare what we call \u201cfictitious objects\u201d. Thus, fictitious\nobjects are necessarily existent objects that have been somehow\n\u201cdiscovered\u201d or \u201cselected\u201d by the authors of\nfictional stories. (For this position, see, for instance, Parsons\n1975, Zalta 1983 and 1988, Jacquette 1996, Berto 2008 and Priest 2011.\nActually, this is one of the applications of contemporary versions of\nMeinongianism. See Sections 5.4 and 5.5 below.) According to the other\nvariety of abstractionism, fictitious objects are abstract artefacts,\ni.e., they are not discovered or selected but created by the\nauthors of fictional\n stories.[16]\n\nThe latter view (today often referred to as \u201ccreationism\u201d)\nfits well into a general ontology of abstract artefacts (like, for\ninstance, literary and other works of fiction as well as non-fictional\ncultural entities) and does justice to the intuition that fictitious\nobjects as well as the works in which they occur are literally brought\ninto being through human acts of creation. However, it is objected\nagainst creationism that the creation of an abstract object is\nsomething deeply mysterious.\n3.3 The Problem of Discourse about the Past and the Future\n\nThe structure of the problem of discourse about the past and the\nfuture is very similar to the structure of the problem of fictional\ndiscourse. Consider the following sentences:\n\n(1)\nSocrates was a philosopher.\n(2)\nThe first female pope will be black.\n\n\nGiven that the sentences (1) and (2) have the logical structure of\npredications, i.e., the structure \u201c\\(Fb\\)\u201d, and given\nthat (PP) is valid, (1) implies that Socrates exists and (2) implies\nthat the first female pope exists.\n\nIndeed, the sentences (1) and (2) look like predications.\nGrammatically speaking, they consist of a subject term\n(\u201cSocrates\u201d, \u201cthe first female pope\u201d) and a\npredicate term (\u201cwas a philosopher\u201d, \u201cwill be\nblack\u201d.) But while it is certainly true now (in the\nthird millennium C.E.) that Socrates was a philosopher, it is also\ncertainly true now that Socrates does not exist anymore.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that indeed\nthere will be a female pope (and exactly one first female pope) at\nsome time in the far future and that she will be black and that she\nhas not even been fathered yet. Given these assumptions, it is\ncertainly true now that the first female pope does not yet exist.\n\nAgain, there are several attempts to resolve this problem. One\npossible strategy is to deny that sentences like (1) and (2) really\nhave the logical structure of predications. One might suggest the\nfollowing alternative interpretations, using \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d\n(read: \u201cIt has been the case\u201d) and\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d (read: \u201cIt will be the case\u201d) as\n\u201ctense operators\u201d:\n\n(1\u2032)\n\\(P\\)(Socrates is a philosopher).\n(2\u2032)\n\\(F\\)(The first female pope is black).\n\n\nNote that the tense operators \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d are sentence operators, like the story\noperator from above. Just as the story operator blocks the inference\nto existence claims about fictitious objects, the tense operators\nblock the inference from (1\u2032) to\n\n(3)\nSocrates exists.\n\n\nand from (2\u2032) to\n\n(4)\nThe first female pope exists. (For a tense operator strategy see\nPrior 1968.)\n\n\nThere is a lot to be said in favor of this logical interpretation of\ntenses. Yet, it leaves some problems unresolved. One of them is the\nproblem of tensed plural quantifiers. Consider, for\ninstance:\n\n(5)\nThere have been two kings named Charles.\n\n\nThe standard tense operator interpretation of (5) yields:\n\n(5\u2032)\n\\(P\\)(There are two kings named Charles).\n\n\nHowever, while (5) is true, (5\u2032) is false, since at no time in\nthe past there have been two kings named Charles\nsimultaneously. (See Lewis 2004.) Thus, the standard tense\noperator strategy seems to fail in cases like this one.\n\nAnother problem that the tense operator strategy leaves unresolved is\nthe problem of relations between present and non-present\nobjects. Given the principle that a real (two-place) relation can\nobtain only if both terms of the relation exist, and given that past\nand future objects do not (now) exist, relations between present and\npast or future objects are impossible. Yet it seems that there are\nplenty of relations between present and past (or future) objects. For\ninstance, I stand in the relation of being one of six\ngranddaughters of to my grandmother. Likewise, perhaps I stand in\nthe relation of being the grandmother of to a future\nchild.\n\nHere is a Meinongian solution: Suppose objects pop in and out of\nexistence but thereby do not gain or lose their\nbeing. (For a Meinongian, all existent objects have being but\nnot all being objects exist.) According to this picture,\n\u201cSocrates\u201d now denotes the nonexistent Socrates and\n\u201cthe first female pope\u201d now denotes the nonexistent first\nfemale pope. Accordingly, although we cannot allow for the inference\nfrom\n\n(1)\nSocrates was a philosopher.\n\n\nand\n\n(2)\nThe first female pope will be black.\n\n\nto\n\n(3)\nSocrates exists.\n\n\nand\n\n(4)\nThe first female pope exists.\n\n\nwe can allow for the inference from (1) and (2) to\n\n(3\u2032)\nThere is something that is identical with Socrates.\n\n\nand\n\n(4\u2032)\nThere is something that is identical with the first female\n pope.[17]\n\n\nThis result does justice to two otherwise incompatible intuitions,\nnamely (i) the intuition that neither Socrates nor the first female\npope exist right now, and (ii) the intuition that it is nevertheless\npossible to refer to Socrates and to the first female pope (or, to put\nit another way: the intuition that the name \u201cSocrates\u201d and\nthe description \u201cthe first female pope\u201d are not\nempty).\n\nTensed plural quantifiers do not pose a problem for a Meinongian.\nTensed quantifiers in general may be interpreted as\nrestricted quantifiers that range over a particular subdomain\nof nonexistent objects: \u201cthere was\u201d may be interpreted as\na quantifier that ranges over the subdomain of past objects (i.e.,\nobjects that have existed but do not exist anymore); analogously,\n\u201cthere will be\u201d may be interpreted as a quantifier that\nranges over the subdomain of future objects (i.e., objects that will\nexist but do not exist\n yet).[18]\n\nFurthermore, from a Meinongian point of view, relations between\nexistent and nonexistent objects are ubiquitous. Remember the\nMeinongian solution to the problem of intentionality: people fear,\nadmire, dream of, hope for, or imagine nonexistent objects. Thus,\nrelations between present and non-present objects do not pose a\nparticular problem for a Meinongian.\n3.4 The Problem of Alleged Analytic Truths Like \u201cThe round square is square\u201d\n\nSentences like\n\n(1)\nThe round square is round and a square. \n\n\nseem to be logically true (at least according to the intuitions of\nsome logicians\u2014see Lambert 1983). Furthermore, they seem to have\nthe logical structure of predications. According to (PP) and (EG), (1)\nimplies\n\n(2)\nThere is something that is identical with the round square.\n\n\nand\n\n(3)\nThere is something that is both round and a square.\n\n\nIf \u201cthere is\u201d means the same as \u201cexist\u201d, these\nare, of course, unacceptable consequences.\n\nThere are two obvious ways out: (i) One could simply reject (1) as\nfalse (or truth-valueless). (ii) One could try to find an adequate\nparaphrase for (1) which accounts for the intuition that (1) is\n\u201cin some sense\u201d true. Such a paraphrase might be\n\n(1\u2032)\nIf there were such a thing as the round square, it would be\nround and a square.\n\n\nBut according to the Meinongian picture, (2) and (3) are acceptable\nconsequences, since they do not entail the existence of\nsomething that is both round and square. Something that is both round\nand square is an impossible object, according to Meinong,\nwhich means that it cannot exist, but this does not entail\nthat there is no such thing. Therefore, the Meinongian can\naccept (1) as true, without resorting to any kind of paraphrase.\n\nWe have seen that there are alternative solutions for every single one\nof the abovementioned problems. But, for all we know, the assertion\nthat there are nonexistent objects is the only way to resolve all\nthese diverse problems in a uniform way.\n3.5 Nonexistent Objects in Practical Philosophy\n\nThere is a debate in practical philosophy as to whether nonexistent\npersons are morally relevant. The basic question is this: do\nnonexistent people have interests that we ought to take into account\nin our decisions? Obviously, some of our decisions affect not only\nexistent but also future (i.e., not yet existent) persons; matters of\nclimate change or the disposal of radioactive waste are relevant cases\nin point. Intuitively, we ought to act in such a way as to prevent\ndisasters for future generations. It is a matter of controversy,\nthough, whether, in order to take into account this moral intuition,\nwe have to commit ourselves to an ontology of not yet existent beings.\nSome, however, go still a step further and argue that not only future\npersons are morally relevant but even persons who will never exist\n(and never existed). In particular, this debate concerns questions of\nprocreative ethics and population\n policies.[19]\n4. Problems with Belief in Nonexistent Objects\n\nThe foregoing considerations suggested that the claim that there are\nnonexistent objects has considerable explanatory force. Why, then, is\nthis claim not generally accepted but, rather to the contrary, so\ncontroversial? Is the reason just, as Meinong has put it, \u201ca\nprejudice in favor of the actual\u201d? \u2014 Although ontological\nprejudices may play a role, there are also some good reasons for\nreservations (to put it very carefully).\n\nEven in Meinong\u2019s own writings, there are (roughly) two versions\nof the theory, the original one and a later, revised one. In what\nfollows, we will refer to the original Meinongian object\ntheory by means of the abbreviation \u201cMOT\\(^o\\)\u201d.\n\nPerhaps the most basic principle of MOT\\(^o\\) is the so-called\n\u201cprinciple of independence\u201d, which says,\nliterally: So-being is independent from being (see Meinong\n1959). Ignoring, for the sake of simplicity, Meinong\u2019s\nparticular use of the term \u201cbeing\u201d, we can paraphrase this\nprinciple as: So-being is independent from existence.\n\nThe \u201cso-being\u201d of an object is the totality of the\nobject\u2019s properties apart from the object\u2019s existence or\nnon-existence. The principle of independence says, thus, that an\nobject may have any properties whatsoever, independently of whether\nthe object exists or not. For instance, the (nonexistent) golden\nmountain literally is golden and a mountain; the round square\nliterally is round and a square.\n\nTo every single property and to every set of properties, there is a\ncorresponding object, either an existent or a nonexistent one. Thus,\nthere is, for instance, an object that has the property of being round\nas its sole property; one might call it \u201cthe object\nround\u201d, or simply \u201cround\u201d. There\nis also an object that has the property of being blue as its sole\nproperty (the object blue, or blue, for short).\nFurthermore, there is an object that has the property of being round\nand the property of being blue, and no other properties (the object\nround and blue); and so forth.\n\nIn the notation of classical logic extended with definite descriptions\nof the form \\(\\iota x\\phi(x)\\), the object that has the\nproperty of being blue as its sole property may be represented by\n\u201c\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B)\\)\u201d[20]\n (where \u201c\\(B\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis blue\u201d),\nthe object that has the property of being blue and the property of\nbeing round as its sole properties by\n\u201c\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B \\vee F = R)\\)\u201d (where\n\u201c\\(R\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis round\u201d), and so\nforth.\n\nThe object blue is not identical with the\nproperty of being blue; neither is it identical with the\nset that contains the property of being blue as its sole\nmember. Neither is the object round and blue identical with\nthe set of the property of being blue and the property of being round.\nThe property of being blue is not itself blue, the property of being\nround is not itself round. Analogous considerations hold for sets of\nproperties: sets have neither colors nor shapes. But the object\nblue is blue, and the object round is round, and so\nforth.\n\nOne might wish to ask: Isn\u2019t it impossible that there exists an\nobject that has the property of being blue as its sole\nproperty? Isn\u2019t it necessarily the case that every colored\nobject also has some particular shape, some particular size, is made\nof some particular material, and so forth?\n\nThe Meinongian answer to this question is as follows: It is indeed\nimpossible that such an object exists! Therefore, the object\nblue is not only nonexistent but even necessarily\nnonexistent. Of course, the same holds for the object round,\nthe object red and round, and infinitely many other objects\nas well. Every existing object has infinitely many\nproperties. Every existing object is a completely determined\n(or, in short: a complete) object. Objects like blue\nand round and blue are incompletely determined (or,\nin short: incomplete)\n objects.[21]\n\nIncomplete objects are necessarily nonexistent. They are, in this\nsense, impossible objects (even though their properties may\nnot be contradictory). It should be noted, however, that not every\ncomplete object exists. Consider, for instance, the object that looks\nexactly like me except that it has green eyes instead of blue ones.\nLet\u2019s assume that this object (my nonexistent green-eyed\ncounterpart) has all the properties that I have except for those that\nare entailed by the difference in eye color, given the actual laws of\nnature. My nonexistent green-eyed counterpart is completely determined\nand nevertheless does not exist. But, in contrast to blue,\nthis counterpart could exist, i.e., it is a possible\nnonexistent\n object.[22]\n\nUnfortunately, however, MOT\\(^o\\) has a number of paradoxical\nconsequences. Bertrand Russell, Meinong\u2019s most famous critic,\nput forward two objections against\n MOT\\(^o\\).[23]\n The first objection goes as follows: According to MOT\\(^o\\),\nthere is an object that is both round and square, but such an object\nis \u201capt to infringe the law of contradiction\u201d, since it\nwould be both round and not round (Russell 1973c, 107).\n\nMeinong perhaps could have replied to this objection that the object\ncalled \u201cthe round square\u201d has the properties of being\nround and being square, but not the property of being not round, and\nthus the round square does not infringe the law of contradiction (but\nonly the geometrical law that everything that is square is not round).\nSuch a reply, however, would have been a bit beside the point, since\nit is clear that, according to the principles of MOT\\(^o\\),\nthere is an object that is both round and not round (and evidently the\nobject that Russell had in mind was of this sort). Indeed, Meinong did\nnot deny that the round square infringes the law of contradiction.\nInstead, he replied to Russell\u2019s first objection that the law of\ncontradiction holds for existent objects only. Objects that are both\nround and not round, however, are necessarily nonexistent.\n\nRussell accepted this reply but forged a second objection that could\nnot be dismissed in the same vein. Russell argues that since it is a\nprinciple of MOT\\(^o\\) that to every set of properties\nthere is a corresponding object and since existence is treated as a\nproperty within MOT\\(^o\\), there must be an object that has\nexactly the following three properties: being golden, being a\nmountain, and being existent. If \u201c\\(G\\)\u201d stands for\n\u201cis golden\u201d, \u201c\\(M\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis\na mountain\u201d and \u201c\\(\\rE!\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis\nexistent\u201d, this object is denoted by\n\u201c\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = G \\vee F = M \\vee F = \\rE!)\\)\u201d. Thus, it follows from the principles of\nMOT\\(^o\\) that there is an existent object that is\ngolden and a mountain. But it is an empirical fact that no golden\nmountain exists. Given the (apparently trivial) assumption that\n\u201c\\(b\\) is existent\u201d is equivalent with\n\u201c\\(b\\) exists\u201d, this is a contradiction.\n\nA further paradox seems to arise from the incompleteness of many\nMeinongian objects:\n\nThe object blue (i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B)\\), according to MOT\\(^o)\\) has the property of being\nblue as its sole property. (Theorem of MOT\\(^o)\\)\nThe object blue has exactly one property. (1)\nThe object blue has the property of having exactly one\nproperty. (2)\nThe property of being blue is not identical with the property of\nhaving exactly one property.\nThus, blue has (at least) two properties, namely the\nproperty of being blue and the property of having exactly one\nproperty. (1, 3, 4)\nThus, blue has exactly one property and blue has\n(at least) two properties. (2, 5)\n\n\nFurthermore, it seems that many Meinongian objects do not only\ninfringe laws of logic and geometry, but also intuitively plausible\nprinciples like \u201cIf something is round, it occupies some region\nin space\u201d and \u201cIf something is a mountain, it is\naccessible to the senses\u201d. It seems that having a particular\nshape entails occupying a region in space and that being a mountain\nentails accessibility to the senses (in principle). According to\nMOT\\(^o\\), the round square is round and the golden mountain is\na mountain, but obviously neither the round square nor the golden\nmountain occupies any region in space and neither of them is\naccessible to the senses.\n\nAnother strange consequence of MOT\\(^o\\) is the following: If an\nobject comes into existence, all that happens is that the object turns\nfrom a nonexistent into an existent one. Analogously, if an object\ngoes out of existence, all that happens is that the object turns from\nan existent again into a nonexistent one. Apart from this, neither the\nobject in question nor the world as a whole changes in any way. For\ninstance, when I cease to exist, all that happens is that I will again\nbe nonexistent (as it was from the beginning of time to 1966). In all\nother respects, I will stay just the same. Maybe such a thought is\npotentially comforting for those who love me, but it is surely at odds\nwith our normal understanding of coming into existence and passing\naway.\n5. Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness\n\nThere is a diversity of contemporary theories of nonexistent objects,\nwhere \u201ctheory of nonexistent objects\u201d is meant to include\nany theory that attempts to make sense of (alleged) talk about\nnonexistent objects and/or (seeming) intentional directedness to\nnonexistent objects. Some of them, like the de-ontologization strategy\nand fictionalism, take a reductionist route. The de-ontologization\nstrategy claims that there can be true sentences about nonexistent\nobjects, although there are no nonexistent objects. Fictionalism\nclaims that talk about nonexistent objects is not to be taken\nliterally but as a sort of \u201cpretense\u201d. The other worlds\nstrategy makes use of the assumption of merely possible (and even\nimpossible) worlds. Other contemporary theories of nonexistent\nobjects, however, are closer to Meinong\u2019s original theory but\nhave amended MOT\\(^o\\) in such a way as to avoid at least some\nof the abovementioned paradoxes. Those are often called\n\u201cneo-Meinongian theories\u201d. Usually, they adopt either the\nnuclear-extranuclear strategy or the dual copula strategy in order to\nfree Meinongian object theory from inconsistencies and\ncounterintuitive consequences.\n5.1 The De-ontologization Strategy\n\nTim Crane (see Crane 2012 and 2013) holds that all of the following\nclaims are true:\n\nWe can think and talk about nonexistent objects.\nNonexistent objects do not have any kind of being whatsoever.\nThe sentence \u201cThere are nonexistent objects\u201d is\ntrue.\nSome predications with non-referring singular terms in subject\npositions are true, e.g.: \u201cVulcan was a planet postulated by Le\nVerrier\u201d; \u201cSherlock Holmes is more famous than any living\ndetective\u201d; \u201cPegasus is a mythical horse\u201d.\nContrary to what Meinongians think, nonexistent objects do not\nhave all of the properties they are characterized as having. For\ninstance, Pegasus is a not a horse; thus, \u201cPegasus is a\nhorse\u201d is not true (although \u201cPegasus is a mythical\nhorse\u201d is). Neither is the round square round.\n\n\nCrane can hold the conjunction of 1 and 2 because he interprets\naboutness in a non-relational way. He can hold the\nconjunction of 2 and 3 because he denies that \u201cthere are\u201d\nand its cognates (both in natural and formal languages) are\nontologically committing in any way. (For this reason, I call this the\nde-ontologization strategy.) He can hold the conjunction of 4 and 5\nbecause he endorses a positive free logic, i.e., the view that there\nmay be true as well as false sentences of the form \\(Fb\\), where\n\u201c\\(b\\)\u201d stands for a non-referring singular term.\n\nBy denying that Pegasus is a horse and the round square is round Crane\ncircumvents some of the above-mentioned problems of Meinongianism.\nHowever, his view raises another problem: Why is \u201cPegasus is a\nmythical horse\u201d true, while \u201cPegasus is a horse\u201d is\nnot? In general, why is it that certain predications with\nnon-referring singular terms are true and others are not? For,\naccording to the de-ontologization strategy, neither \u201cPegasus is\na mythical horse\u201d nor \u201cPegasus is a horse\u201d can be\nmade true by the referent of \u201cPegasus\u201d, because there is\nno such thing. Crane (2013) offers what he calls a\n\u201creductionist\u201d solution to this problem. That is,\naccording to Crane, sentences \u201cabout\u201d nonexistent objects\nare made true by something else, i.e., by something existent. For\ninstance, the sentence \u201cVulcan was a planet postulated by Le\nVerrier in 1859 to explain the perturbations in the orbit of\nMercury\u201d is made true by certain events in 1859, namely by\npostulation events; the sentence \u201cSherlock Holmes is more famous\nthan Sir Ian Blair\u201d is made true by the fact that more people\nhave heard about Sherlock Holmes than about Sir Ian Blair (where to\nhave heard about Holmes is to have heard about the respective\nstories); the sentence \u201cPegasus is a mythical winged horse that\nsprung into being from the blood of Medusa\u201d is made true by a\nmyth which represents Pegasus as being such-and-such; the sentence\n\u201cSiegfried is one of the most unappealing heroes in all dramatic\nworks\u201d is made true by certain facts about the last two parts of\nWagner\u2019s Ring. As these examples already show, Crane\ndoes not give a uniform, systematic account of the truth of sentences\nabout fictitious objects, as he himself concedes. (See Crane 2013,\nSection 5.5.)\n\n\nFor another example of a reductionist solution, Frank Jackson holds\nthat one can assent to \u201cMr. Pickwick is Dickens\u2019 most\nfamous character\u201d without an ontological commitment to\nfictitious characters in general and Mr. Pickwick in particular. For,\naccording to Jackson\u2019s de-ontologization strategy, object\nlanguage sentences are ontologically neutral. Ontological commitment\ncomes in only at the meta-language level, for instance, if we would\nclaim that the name \u201cMr. Pickwick\u201d denotes Dickens\u2019s\nmost famous character or that the predicate \u201ca character in\nDickens\u201d applies to something. (See Jackson 1980.)\n\nA de-ontologization strategy with respect to fictitious characters is\nalso to be found in Crittenden 1973 and in Azzouni 2010.\n5.2 Fictionalism and Indifferentism\n\nIn recent years, something close to the de-ontologization\nstrategy\u2014or rather a bundle of more or less similar\nstrategies\u2014became prominent, known under the heading\n\u201cfictionalism\u201d. The basic idea of fictionalism is, roughly\nput, that utterances belonging to a certain region of discourse are\nnot to be taken literally, that speakers producing such utterances\nhave a fictional attitude towards them and are engaged in a sort of\npretense or make-believe. (For an overview of the diverse versions of\nfictionalism as well as a succinct presentation of its most important\npros and cons see the entry on\n fictionalism.)\n\nFictionalism differs from the de-ontologization strategy since\nfictionalists do not claim that the relevant utterances are literally\ntrue; to the contrary, according to fictionalism, certain kinds of\ndiscourse consist of utterances that are false (if taken literally),\nbut nevertheless it may be useful in some respects to stick to that\nsorts of discourse.\n\nA general assessment of fictionalism is difficult since the positions\nincluded under this heading differ considerably from each other. Much\ndepends on how exactly the \u201cfictional attitude\u201d is spelled\nout. Many versions of fictionalism are prone to the\n\u201cphenomenological objection\u201d: external talk about\nfictitious objects\u2014to mention one of the applications of the\nfictionalist strategy that is particularly relevant in the context of\nthe present entry\u2014does not feel like \u201cmake-believe\u201d;\nintrospection does not reveal that we are engaged in any kind of\npretense when we say things like \u201cSherlock Holmes is one of the\nmost famous characters of popular literature\u201d and the like.\n\nA position inspired by and in important respects similar to\nfictionalism that, however, avoids the phenomenological objection is\nEklund\u2019s \u201cindifferentism\u201d. Indifferentism is the\nview that speakers outside the \u201cphilosophy room\u201d are often\nsimply indifferent with regards of the ontological implications of\ntheir utterances and thus are not committed to the existence of those\nentities whose existence is implied by their utterances. As Eklund\nemphasizes, however, indifferentism does not say anything about which\nentities one should accept in one\u2019s ontology; it is, in\nthis sense, not an ontological thesis. (See Eklund 2005.)\n5.3 The Other Worlds Strategy\n\nThe other worlds strategy has been proposed by Graham Priest (2005)\nand Francesco Berto (2008). Priest calls his theory noneism;\nBerto names it modal Meinongianism. The term\n\u201cnoneism\u201d has been coined by Richard Routley, and Priest\nnot only takes over the name but also essential features of\nRoutley\u2019s theory (among other things the assumption that basic\nprinciples of standard logics, like the principle of contradiction, do\nnot hold without restriction\u2014without, of course, accepting that\neverything is true).\n\nProponents of the other worlds strategy reject both the\nnuclear-extranuclear strategy and the dual copula strategy. Instead,\nthey assume merely possible and even impossible worlds. All worlds\n(possible as well as impossible ones) share the same domain of\ndiscourse. But not all objects of the domain exist in all worlds.\nThus, Pegasus does not exist in the actual world, but it exists in a\nvariety of merely possible worlds (namely in those which are such as\nrepresented by the Greek mythology).\n\nAccording to the other worlds strategy, nonexistent objects literally\nhave the properties through which they are\n\u201ccharacterized\u201d\u2014but they have these properties not\nin the actual world but only in those worlds \u201cwhich realize the\nway the objects are represented as being in the appropriate cognitive\nstate [\u2026].\u201d (Priest 2011b, 249, footnote 35) Suppose you\nimagine a winged horse. In this case, in your imagination, you have an\nintentional object that is represented as being winged and a horse.\nThus, the intentional object of your present intentional state is a\nnonexistent winged horse, which is, however, in the actual world\nneither winged nor a horse. In some worlds, however, this object\n\\(is\\) winged and a horse \u2013 namely in those worlds which\nrealize the way the object is represented in your\n imagination.[24]\n\nThe other worlds strategy provides the following solution to the\nparadox of contradiction: The round square exists only in impossible\nworlds. In impossible worlds, however, the principle of contradiction\ndoes not hold. Therefore, the round square\u2019s being both round\nand not round does not infringe the laws of logic which hold in those\nworlds in which the round square exists.\n\nIn the actual world, however, the round square is neither round nor\nsquare, since roundness and squareness are \u201cexistence-entailing\nproperties\u201d, i.e., \u201c\\(b\\) is round/square\u201d\nentails \u201c\\(b\\) exists\u201d. Therefore, even if in the\nactual world (and in all other possible worlds) the law of\ncontradiction holds, the round square does not infringe this law,\nsince in these worlds the round square is neither round nor not\nround.\n\nIn the light of this theory, it is easy to explain why nobody has ever\nseen the round square or a golden mountain and why the round square is\nobviously not located in space: since the round square is neither\nround nor square in the actual world, there is no reason to assume\nthat it occupies space or is accessible to the senses. Similar\nconsiderations hold for the golden mountain.\n\nIt is worth noting that the postulation of existence-entailing\nproperties is an implicit rejection of Meinong\u2019s principle of\nindependence, which is one of the cornerstones of Meinongian object\ntheory.\n\nProponents of the other worlds strategy reject the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction because they find it \u201cdifficult\nto avoid the feeling that the class [of nuclear predicates] has been\ngerrymandered simply to avoid problems\u201d (Priest 2005, 83).\n\nBut Priest\u2019s proposal has difficulties of its\n own.[25]\n To mention some of them: First, Priest does not give a principled\ncharacterization of which properties are existence-entailing and which\nare not (which looks quite similar to the problem with the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction which Priest points out in the above\nquotation). Second, it remains unclear which properties nonexistent\nobjects have in the actual world (apart from logical properties like\nbeing self-identical and intentional properties like being thought of\nby\n Priest).[26]\n Furthermore, Priest\u2019s noneism raises difficult questions about\ncross-world identity and the ontological status of non-actual worlds.\nThe ontological status of non-actual worlds is far from obvious: they\nmay be taken to be concrete objects (structured sets of physical\nobjects) or abstract objects (sets of sentences, propositions, or\nstates of affairs). (For an elaborate survey of various conceptions of\nnon-actual worlds see the entry on\n possible worlds, i.e., Menzel\n 2014.)[27]\n Apart from this, it is doubtful whether Priest\u2019s theory\nprovides an adequate account of fictitious objects. Among other\nthings, it does not do justice to the widespread intuition that\nfictitious objects are created by the authors of the stories\nto which they\n belong.[28]\n5.4 Nuclear and Extranuclear Properties\n\nAccording to the nuclear-extranuclear strategy, there are two kinds of\nproperties: nuclear and extranuclear ones. (Meinong 1972,\n \u00a725)[29]\n An object\u2019s nuclear properties are supposed to constitute the\nobject\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d, while its extranuclear properties\nare supposed to be external to the object\u2019s nature. Nuclear\nproperties are, for instance: being blue, being tall, kicking\nSocrates, having been kicked by Socrates, kicking somebody, being\ngolden, being a mountain (Parsons 1980, 23).\n\nWhich properties are extranuclear? Terence Parsons distinguishes four\ncategories of \u201cextranuclear predicates\u201d (i.e., predicates\nthat stand for extranuclear properties): ontological\n(\u201cexists\u201d, \u201cis mythical\u201d, \u201cis\nfictional\u201d), modal (\u201cis possible\u201d, \u201cis\nimpossible\u201d), intentional (\u201cis thought about by\nMeinong\u201d, \u201cis worshipped by someone\u201d), technical\n(\u201cis complete\u201d) (Parsons 1980,\n 23).[30]\n\nNuclear properties are either constitutive or\nconsecutive, in Meinong\u2019s terms (Meinong 1972, 176). An\nobject\u2019s constitutive properties are those properties that are\nmentioned explicitly in a description that is used to pick out the\nobject. Thus, the constitutive properties of the golden mountain are\nbeing golden and being a mountain. An object\u2019s consecutive\nproperties are those properties that are somehow included or implied\nby the object\u2019s constitutive properties. Thus, among the\nconsecutive properties of the golden mountain are probably the\nproperties of being a material thing and of being extended.\n\nAccording to MOT\\(^o\\), the object called \u201cthe golden\nmountain\u201d was \\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = G \\vee F = M)\\), i.e.,\nthe object that has the property of being golden and the property of\nbeing a mountain (and no other properties). According to the revised\nversion of object theory, the object called \u201cthe golden\nmountain\u201d is the object that has all the nuclear properties that\nare implied by the nuclear property of being golden and the nuclear\nproperty of being a mountain, i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F^n (F^n x \\equiv G^n \\Rightarrow F^n \\vee\nM^n \\Rightarrow F^n)\\).[31]\n\nHow does the nuclear-extranuclear distinction help to avoid the\nparadoxes mentioned in the section above? \u2014 Consider again the\nparadox from incompleteness: According to MOT\\(^o\\), there is an\nobject that has the property of being blue as its sole property\n(we\u2019ve called it \u201cthe object blue\u201d, for\nshort), in logical notation:\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B)\\). It seems to be true of the object blue, by\ndefinition, that it has exactly one property. Yet, the property\nof having exactly one property is clearly distinct from the property\nof being blue. Thus, it seems that the object blue has at\nleast two properties.\n\nAccording to the revised version of object theory with the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction (MOT\\(^{ne}\\), for short), this\nparadox is avoided in the following way: The property of being blue is\na nuclear (constitutive) property, the property of having exactly one\nproperty, however, is an extranuclear property. There\naren\u2019t any objects that have exactly one property. There are\nonly objects that have exactly one constitutive (nuclear)\nproperty. Objects that have only a limited number of constitutive\nproperties may (and necessarily do) have additional extranuclear\nproperties\u2014like the property of having exactly \\(n\\)\nconstitutive properties or the property of being incomplete. The\nobject called \u201cblue\u201d is\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F^n(F^n x \\equiv B^n \\Rightarrow F^n\\)), i.e.,\nthe object that has the property of being blue as its sole\nconstitutive property. This does not rule out that the object\nblue may have additional extranuclear properties.\nThus, the paradox from incompleteness does not arise in\n MOT\\(^{ne}\\).[32]\n\nTo Russell\u2019s objection that the existent golden mountain\ninfringes the law of contradiction (since it is both existent and\nnonexistent), advocates of MOT\\(^{ne}\\) may reply as follows:\nExistence is an extranuclear property, but only nuclear properties can\nbe constitutive properties of an object. Therefore, according to\nMOT\\(^{ne}\\), there simply is no such object as\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = G \\vee F = M \\vee F = \\rE!)\\)\n(i.e., the existent golden mountain). (This route is taken by Dale\nJacquette and Richard Routley. See Jacquette 1996, 81 and Routley\n1980, 496.)\n\nThis solution, however, imposes quite a heavy restriction on the\ntheory of objects. Probably this was the reason why Meinong himself\ndid not even mention it as a possible solution. Instead, he introduced\nin addition to the nuclear-extranuclear distinction the doctrine\nof watered-down extranuclear properties: at least some\nextranuclear properties (existence, possibility) have nuclear\ncounterparts, i.e., \u201cwatered-down\u201d versions of\nextranuclear properties (Meinong 1972,\n \u00a737).[33]\n\nIf the extranuclear property of existence has a watered-down nuclear\ncounterpart, the following answer to Russell\u2019s objection is\navailable: \u201cThe existent golden mountain exists\u201d is\nambiguous. It may be read as \u201cThe existent golden mountain\nexemplifies extranuclear existence\u201d (which is false), or it may\nbe read as \u201cThe existent golden mountain exemplifies nuclear\nexistence\u201d (which is true). There is no contradiction between\n\u201cThe existent golden mountain exemplifies nuclear\nexistence\u201d and \u201cThe existent golden mountain does not\nexist\u201d (in the proper, extranuclear sense).\n\nDo other extranuclear properties (besides existence) also have nuclear\ncounterparts? Do perhaps all extranuclear properties have\nnuclear counterparts? Meinong himself is not explicit about this\npoint, but it seems very natural to extend the theory in this way.\nTerence Parsons has adopted this extension (Parsons 1980, 68), while\nDale Jacquette rejects the doctrine of watered-down extranuclear\nproperties altogether, even for existence and possibility (Jacquette\n1996, 85\u201387).\n\nThere are several paradoxes for which MOT\\(^{ne}\\) does not supply\na solution (even if it is supplemented with the doctrine of\nwatered-down extranuclear properties). It still seems that the round\nsquare infringes the law of contradiction; one still may wonder why it\nis impossible to discover round squares and golden mountains; and one\nstill may be baffled by the doctrine that nonexistent objects differ\nfrom existent ones only in that the former lack\n existence.[34]\n5.5 The Dual Copula Strategy\n\nAccording to the dual copula strategy, there are two kinds of\nrelations between properties and\n individuals.[35]\n Different advocates of this strategy use different terminologies for\nit. Here are some of them:\n\nThe golden mountain is determined by the property of\nbeing golden and by the property of being a mountain.\n\nThe golden mountain satisfies the property of being\nincompletely determined. (Mally 1912)\nThe golden mountain has the property of being golden and\nthe property of being a mountain assigned to it.\n\nThe golden mountain immanently contains the property of\nbeing incompletely determined. (Ingarden 1931 [1973], \u00a720, p.\n122)\nThe golden mountain is consociated with the property of\nbeing golden and the property of being a mountain.\nThe golden mountain is consubstantiated with the\nproperty of being incompletely determined. (Casta\u00f1eda\n1972)\nThe property of being golden and the property of being a\nmountain are ascribed to the golden mountain.\n\nThe golden mountain has the property of being\nincompletely determined. (van Inwagen\n 1977)[36]\nThe golden mountain is constituted by the properties of\nbeing golden and being a mountain.\n\nThe golden mountain exemplifies the property of being\nincompletely determined. (Rapaport 1978)\nThe golden mountain encodes the property of being golden\nand the property of being a mountain.\nThe golden mountain exemplifies the property of being\nincompletely determined. (Zalta 1983)\n\n\nThe various versions of the dual copula strategy share the assumption\nthat the copula \u201cis\u201d is ambiguous. In what follows, we\nwill use the exemplification-encoding terminology. In addition, we\nwill borrow from Zalta the following notational convention:\n\u201c\\(Fb\\)\u201d stands for \u201c\\(b\\)\nexemplifies the property of being \\(F\\)\u201d.\n\u201c\\(bF\\)\u201d stands for \u201c\\(b\\)\nencodes the property of being \\(F\\)\u201d. Furthermore,\nwe will use MOT\\(^{dc}\\) as an abbreviation for \u201cthe revised\nversion of Meinongian object theory which makes use of a dual copula\ndistinction\u201d.\n\nAccording to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called \u201cthe round\nsquare\u201d is the object that encodes the property of being round\nand the property of being square (and all of the properties that are\nimplied by these properties) and no other properties. Thus, according\nto MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called \u201cthe round square\u201d\nis \\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv R \\Rightarrow F \\vee S \\Rightarrow F)\\).\n\nThus, according to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called \u201cthe\nround square\u201d encodes exactly two constitutive properties (being\nround and being square). However, over and above this, there are many\n(indeed infinitely many) properties that are\nexemplified by this object, for instance: the property of not\nbeing red, the property of not encoding the property of being red, the\nproperty of not being determined with respect to its side length, the\nproperty of having thought of by Bertrand Russell, the property of\nencoding exactly two constitutive properties, the property of being\nincompletely determined.\n\nTo mention another popular example, consider Pegasus: Among other\nthings, Pegasus encodes the properties of being a horse, of having\nwings, of having been tamed by Bellerophon. But there are also\ninfinitely many properties that Pegasus exemplifies, for instance, the\nproperty of not being determined with respect to the number of hairs\nin its tail, the property of being a character of Greek mythology, the\nproperty of being a fictitious object.\n\nIt must be emphasized that something that encodes the property of\nbeing a horse is not a horse (in the usual predicative sense\nof \u201cis\u201d). Analogously, something that encodes the\nproperties of being round and square is neither round nor square. That\nis to say, something that encodes the property of being a horse does\nnot belong to the class of horses, and something that encodes the\nproperties of being round and square does neither belong to the class\nof round things nor to the class of square things. Rather, things that\nencode the properties of being a horse or being a square or being a\nDanish prince are abstract objects\u2014abstract in the\nsense that they are neither mental nor spatio-temporal things. In\ngeneral, everything which encodes at least one property is an abstract\nobject in this\n sense.[37]\n\nLet\u2019s see how MOT\\(^{dc}\\) avoids the alleged paradoxes\nmentioned in section 4. The first objection was that objects like the\nround square infringe the law of contradiction, since such objects\nwould be both round and not round. According to MOT\\(^{dc}\\),\nhowever, the object called \u201cthe round\nsquare\u201d\u2014\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv R \\Rightarrow F \\vee S \\Rightarrow F)\\)\u2014is not round (i.e., does not exemplify the property\nof being round). Thus, no contradiction arises.\n\nThe second objection was that the existent golden mountain would\ninfringe the law of contradiction, since, if there were such an\nobject, it would be both existent and nonexistent. According to\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\), one could answer to this objection as follows: The\nobject called \u201cthe existent golden mountain\u201d is\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv G \\Rightarrow F \\vee M \\Rightarrow F \\vee \\rE! \\Rightarrow F)\\). This object encodes the property of being\nexistent, but it does not exemplify it. Since\n\u201c\\(b\\) encodes \\(F\\)\u201d does not imply\n\u201c\\(b\\) exemplifies \\(F\\)\u201d, there is no\ncontradiction involved here.\n\nAccording to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object blue is\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv B \\Rightarrow F)\\), i.e., the object that encodes exclusively the\nproperties that are implied by being blue. Thus, the object\nblue exemplifies the property of encoding only the\nproperties that are implied by being blue. It is not the case that the\nobject blue has exactly one property and at the same time has\nat least two properties, at least not, if \u201chas\u201d is used in\nthe same sense in both occurrences. In this way, the apparent\ncontradiction disappears.\n\nFurthermore, according to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called\n\u201cthe round square\u201d, i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv R \\Rightarrow F \\vee S \\Rightarrow F)\\), does not occupy\nany region in space. More exactly, it does not exemplify the property\nof occupying some region in space (though, perhaps it encodes this\nproperty, if being round implies occupying some region in space).\nAnalogously, according to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), the object called\n\u201cthe golden mountain\u201d, i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(xF \\equiv G \\Rightarrow F \\vee M \\Rightarrow F)\\), does not\nexemplify the property of being accessible to the senses (at best, it\nencodes this property). Therefore, there is nothing paradoxical in the\nfact that nobody has ever seen a golden mountain and that it is\nimpossible to determine the location of the round square.\n\nFinally, MOT\\(^{dc}\\) does not have the counterintuitive\nconsequence that the only difference between existent and nonexistent\nobjects is that the latter lack the property of being existent, such\nthat if an object goes out of existence, the vast majority of its\nproperties (like being human, loving pancakes, being violent-tempered,\nand so forth) stay exactly the same. Consider again my nonexistent\ngreen-eyed counterpart. According to MOT\\(^{dc}\\), this object\nencodes being human, being female, being a philosopher, and\nso forth, but does not exemplify these properties; therefore,\nit does not belong to the class of female philosophers, not even to\nthe class of humans or to the class of living beings. Thus, it is\nclear that my green-eyed counterpart\u2019s nonexistence is by far\nnot the only difference between it and myself. In general, nonexistent\nobjects are a particular kind of objects, according to\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\)\u2014very different from ordinary existent objects.\nIn what follows, we\u2019ll call them \u201cMeinongian\nobjects\u201d.\n5.6 Nonexistence Does Not Hold the Key\n\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\) is very remote from MOT\\(^o\\). Recall that,\naccording to MOT\\(^o\\), the object called \u201cthe golden\nmountain\u201d is not an abstract object but something as concrete as\nevery existent mountain in the world. Secondly, and related to this,\nthe idea that some objects do not exist is one of the cornerstones of\nMOT\\(^o\\)\u2014but it is not an essential feature of\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\), i.e., it doesn\u2019t play an essential role within\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\). Within MOT\\(^{dc}\\), Meinongian objects are\ndefined as a particular kind of abstract objects (namely abstract\nobjects to which two kinds of predicates apply). Of course, one can\ndecide to say that these objects are \u201cnonexistent\u201d; but\nnothing hinges upon this decision. According to MOT\\(^o\\), the\nonly difference between Meinongian objects and normal objects consists\nin the alleged nonexistence of the former. However, in\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\), Meinongian objects are distinct from normal objects\nbecause only the former are abstract objects which encode properties.\nThis suffices to distinguish Meinongian objects from normal objects.\nThus, there is no need to assume that existence is a property of\nindividuals and that there is a difference between \u201cThere are\nobjects that are such-and-such\u201d and \u201cObjects that are\nsuch-and-such exist\u201d.\n\nIf MOT\\(^{dc}\\) is essentially different from MOT\\(^o\\), the\nquestion arises to what extent MOT\\(^{dc}\\) can fulfill the tasks\nMOT\\(^o\\) was supposed to fulfill. It seems that\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\) cannot do everything MOT\\(^o\\) was\nsupposed to do. First, consider the problem of intentionality: if\nsomebody fears the devil, does he fear an abstract object? \u2014\nThis seems to be psychologically impossible, for an abstract object\ncannot do any harm to\n anybody.[38]\n Second, recall the problem of negative singular existence sentences:\nAstronomers claim that Vulcan does not exist. Do they thereby intend\nto deny the existence of an abstract object that only encodes being\nsuch-and-such a planet? \u2014 Probably not. They rather deny the\nexistence of something that is a planet, i.e., a concrete\nmaterial thing. Finally, consider the problem of discourse about the\npast and the future: when a teacher in a history of philosophy class\ntalks about Socrates, does she then intend to talk about an abstract\nobject that only encodes all of the properties that Socrates (the\n\u201creal\u201d one) once exemplified? \u2014 Presumably not. If\nthere is an object which she is intentionally directed at, then it is\nprobably the \u201creal\u201d Socrates, not its abstract\ncounterpart.\n\nIt may be that proponents of MOT\\(^{dc}\\) find ways to meet these\nobjections such that their theories provide solutions for the problem\nof intentionality, the problem of singular existence sentences, and\nthe problem of reference to past and future objects. But even if they\ndon\u2019t, it is beyound doubt that Neo-Meinongian theories can be\nand indeed are fruitful in many ways. In particular, they provide the\nbasis for a consistent realist ontology of fictitious objects. (For a\nvariety of further applications see in particular the writings of\nJacquette, Parsons, and Zalta.)\n6. Themes for Further Investigation\n\nThere are several ways in which Meinongian object theory can be\ndeveloped further. Here are some of\n them:[39]\n\n1. Both MOT\\(^{ne}\\) and MOT\\(^{dc}\\) could perhaps benefit\nfrom a clarification of their basic distinctions, namely the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction and the dual copula distinction,\nrespectively.\n\n2. One feature of Meinong\u2019s mature object theory not mentioned\nso far is the \u201cdoctrine of implexion\u201d. Implexion is a\nrelation between incomplete and complete objects which seems to be\nvery close to what is often called \u201cinstantiation\u201d, i.e.,\na relation between universals and particulars. Incomplete objects are\n\u201cimplected\u201d in complete ones. (See Meinong 1972,\n\u00a729.) Meinong himself eventually came to interpret incomplete\nobjects as universals (see Meinong 1972, 739f). Meinongian object\ntheory may thus be interpreted as a sophisticated theory of\nuniversals, in particular as a theory of types (as opposed to\nproperties), which might open further fields of application.\n\n3. Throughout this entry, we have presupposed realism with respect to\nproperties. However, it is doubtful whether a theory of Meinongian\nobjects is necessarily ontologically committed to properties.\nAn ontologically neutral quantifier and the use of non-objectual\nvariables for predicates (not for names of predicates or\nproperties) may help to avoid this commitment and thus could make\nMeinongian object theory much more parsimonious.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alai, Mario, 2006, \u201cSpeaking of Nonexistent Objects,\u201d\nin Raspa, Venanzio (ed.), <em>Meinongian Issues in Contemporary\nItalian Philosophy</em>, Heusenstamm: Ontos, 119\u2013159.", "Azzouni, Jody, 2004, <em>Deflating Existential Consequence: A Case\nfor Nominalism</em>, New York: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2010, <em>Talking about Nothing: Numbers,\nHallucinations, and Fictions</em>, New York: Oxford University\nPress.", "Barbero, Carola, 2005, <em>Madame Bovary: Something Like a\nMelody</em>, Milano: Edizioni Albo Versorio.", "Berto, Francesco, 2008, \u201cModal Meinongianism for Fictional\nObjects,\u201d <em>Metaphysica</em>, 9: 205\u2013218.", "Brentano, Franz, 1874, <em>Psychology from an Empirical\nStandpoint</em>, translated by Anto C.
