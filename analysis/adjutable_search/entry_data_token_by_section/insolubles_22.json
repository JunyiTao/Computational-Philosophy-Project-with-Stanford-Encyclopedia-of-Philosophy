    "main_text": "The Late Period || Marsilius of Inghen\n4.1 Marsilius of Inghen\n\nSpade (1980: 6) suggests the Marsilius\u2019s solution to the\ninsolubles derives, like Gregory\u2019s, from Bradwardine\u2019s. It\nis actually more similar to the modified Heytesbury solution and to\nAlbert of Saxony\u2019s. Marsilius\u2019s treatise was written in\nParis, probably in the 1360s, where Marsilius was in the English\nNation. (He may even have overlapped with Albert, before Albert left\nParis in 1362.) Marsilius\u2019s main idea is that every proposition\nhas two significations, a material signification, which is what we\ntake as its normal or ordinary meaning, about things, and a formal\nsignification, which is meta-linguistic, affirmative propositions\nsignifying that their subject and predicate supposit for the same\nthing, negatives that they don\u2019t. The consequence is that\ninsolubles falsify themselves. Take \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019, for example. Its material signification contradicts its\nformal signification, for its material signification is that\nit\u2019s false, that is, that its predicate does not apply to its\nsubject (that is, to itself), whereas, being affirmative, its formal\nsignification is that its predicate does apply to its subject. So,\nMarsilius concludes, every proposition signifying itself to be false\nfalsifies itself\u2014in being self-contradictory, not in\nSwyneshed\u2019s sense of that phrase. \n\nBut Marsilius rejects the rather simple-minded proof that we noted\nBuridan and Albert give that every proposition asserts or signifies\nits own truth. For that proof turned on the assumption that every\naffirmative (resp. negative) proposition is true if its subject and\npredicate supposit (resp. don\u2019t supposit) for the same thing, by\nthe definition of truth. But insolubles are an immediate\ncounterexample to this. As just noted, \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019 is false (since it falsifies itself), and so its subject\nand predicate do supposit for the same thing. Indeed, \u2018This is\nfalse\u2019 says that \u2018This is false\u2019 is false (rather in\nthe way Gregory\u2019s second mental proposition said that the first\nmental proposition was false) and so, in saying that it\u2019s false\nthat it\u2019s false, its formal signification is that it\u2019s\ntrue. It\u2019s implicitly contradictory and so false. \n",
