    "main_text": "\n\n\nHeinrich Rickert was born in Gda\u0144sk (then Danzig, in Prussia)\non May 25th 1863. His father Heinrich Rickert Sr.\n(1833\u20131902) was a politician and editor in Berlin. Heinrich Sr. was a\nliberal democrat particularly invested in the cause of the German Jews.\nIn 1890 Heinrich Sr. founded the Society Against Anti-Semitism in\nBerlin (Zijderveld 2006, 9). This is an interesting fact about Rickert\nJr.\u2019s background, considering that he eventually worked to\nsupport the appointment of philosophers of Jewish descent, such as\nEdmund Husserl and Georg Simmel, who were not under the protective wing\nof Hermann Cohen, the head of the Marburg School of Neo-Kantianism (see\nbelow) and a very influential Jewish thinker.\n\n\nBetween 1884 and 1885 Rickert was enrolled at the University of\nBerlin, where he attended lectures from the philosopher Friedrich\nPaulsen (1846\u20131908). In 1885 he moved to Strasbourg (then\nStra\u00dfburg and part of the Prussian Reich) where he\nattended the Neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband\u2019s\nlectures. Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a major source of inspiration for\nRickert\u2019s work and he completed a dissertation on The Theory\nof Definition (Rickert 1915) under Windelband\u2019s supervision\nin 1888. In the same year he married Sophie Keibel, a sculptor from\nBerlin. They had four children.\n\n\nIn 1889 Rickert moved to Freiburg for health-related reasons.\nRickert\u2019s health was always precarious. After undergoing\nintestinal surgery in 1896 he suffered lifelong intercostal neuralgia\nand he developed agoraphobia. In spite of his health problems,\nRickert was able to complete his Habilitation under Alois\nRiehl (1844\u20131924) in Freiburg, where he was appointed extraordinary\nprofessor in 1894 and ordinary professor in 1896. The dissertation he\nproduced for the Habilitation, The Object of\nKnowledge, is one of his most important works and a milestone in\nearly twentieth century Neo-Kantianism.\n\n\nRickert remained in Freiburg until 1915, when he accepted an offer\nfrom the University of Heidelberg to replace his recently deceased\nmentor Windelband, who had moved there from Strasbourg in 1903. He\ntaught in Heidelberg until 1932, when he retired. He died on July\n25th 1936 in Heidelberg and was buried in Gda\u0144sk.\n\n\nRickert had a long and successful academic career. He received several\nawards and honorary degrees. He taught and in some cases supervised\nimportant German thinkers of the next generation, such as Martin\nHeidegger (1889\u20131976), Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) and Walter\nBenjamin (1892\u20131940). He had close intellectual exchanges with\nleading figures of his time, including Wilhelm Dilthey\n(1833\u20131911), Georg Simmel (1858\u20131918), Edmund Husserl\n(1859\u20131938), Max Weber (1864\u20131920) and Karl Jaspers\n(1883\u20131969). Although very few of his writings are available in\nEnglish, in recent years there has been a growing interest in\nRickert\u2019s work, both to the extent that it influenced other\nphilosophers and as a significant contribution to the discipline in\nits own right.\n\n\nRickert was a very prolific writer. He managed his publications in a\nway that should strike the contemporary reader as familiar. He would\npresent new ideas and lines of inquiry first in exploratory journal\narticles (many of them published in Logos, the journal he\nfounded in Freiburg) and subsequently he would incorporate them in\nlarger publications, often including previously published materials.\nFollowing a common trend in his time, he kept working at his two major\nbooks, The Object of Knowledge (first published in 1892) and\nThe Limits of Concept-Formation in Natural Science (first\npublished in 1902), for his entire life. Instead of writing new books\nhe would rewrite entire chapters and add new sections to his two\nmagna opera, thereby addressing criticism and\nsometimes even changing significantly his previous views. So, for\ninstance, The Object of Knowledge grew from the 91 pages of\nthe first edition to the 460 pages of the sixth edition in 1928. This\nstyle of writing makes the development of his thought particularly\nperspicuous. However, in spite of his constant revisions and additions,\nthe fundamental principles of Rickert\u2019s philosophy remained\nconstant throughout his career. In keeping with his systematic\nunderstanding of philosophy (see below), his approach to new problems\nwas geared towards connecting them to old problems, and his way of\nhandling criticism was often characterized by an effort to reformulate\nhis opponent\u2019s views so as to make them compatible with his\nown.\n",
