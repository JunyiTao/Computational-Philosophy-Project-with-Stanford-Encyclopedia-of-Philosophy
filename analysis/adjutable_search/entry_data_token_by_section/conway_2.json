    "main_text": "Substance\n3. Substance\n\nStrictly speaking, Conway\u2019s metaphysics is an ontology of three\nkinds of being, which she calls \u201cspecies\u201d. Each of these\nis a single substance distinguished by a particular set of properties\nwhich determine its essence, and set its ontological boundaries.\nConway holds that there can only be three species, and one species\ncannot transform into another. The species are nevertheless\ninter-connected through their shared properties (principally the\n\u201ccommunicable\u201d attributes of God), and differentiated by\nothers (principally mutability which is a property of the second and\nthird species). The second species (Christ or Middle nature) is\ndifferentiated from both God and other created things because it also\nretains God\u2019s immutability. As a causal intermediary between God\nand Created Nature, Middle nature is analogous to Cudworth\u2019s\nPlastic Nature and More\u2019s Spirit of Nature, but a divinized\nversion.\n\nThe question of substance dualism within one of the three species only\narises in relation to the third species or created being. This species\nis itself a unity in multiplicity, since it is a single substance\ncomprising innumerable spirit particles, which Conway also calls\nspecies (a term indicative of their being parts that constitute the\nwhole). The third species as a whole is thus a unity of multiplicities\n(\u201cthe whole creation is just but one substance or entity\u201d,\nexhibiting \u201ca general unity of creatures with one\nanother\u201d; Principles VII.4). Each of these spirit\nparticles consists of infinite spirit particles, every one of which\ncontains infinite numbers of others. These entities may be considered\nmonadic in the sense that each is a unity. But, like created nature as\na whole, they are unities in multiplicity, there being \u201ca\nspecial and peculiar unity among the parts of one [individual] species\nin particular\u201d (Principles, VII.4). It is from\naggregates of these that creatures are formed. The mutability of all\ncreated beings means that there is considerable\u2014nay\ninfinite\u2014variety within created nature.\n\nConway\u2019s case for substance monism rests on fundamental\nprinciples of her metaphysics: it is grounded first in her vitalist\nconception of all being. On the principle of similitude whereby all\nthings bear some resemblance to God, everything in existence must be\nin some sense alive\u2014from God down through angels, to human\nbeings, animals, plants and mere dust. There are of course other\nattributes of created things not shared by God (mutability, shape or\n\u201cfigure\u201d and solidity or density). Also, creatures, unlike\nGod, are multiple and subject to time. Since all substance created by\nGod must be living, it follows there can be no non-living substance.\nFurthermore, matter being nothing but inert extension\n(\u201cdead\u201d is Conway\u2019s adjective) is devoid of likeness\nto God, so cannot exist. It follows that body and soul (or spirit) are\nnot distinct substances, but different gradations or modes of the same\nsubstance. Secondly, all created things are subject to change, and\nchange is only possible between things that are alike. This holds both\nfor divine causality and change within created nature. The main limit\nto change is ontological: creatures may change radically, but not to\nthe extent that they might lose any of their essential properties, or\nacquire others, for that would entail change of substance. It follows,\ntherefore, that within the ontological parameters of the third\nspecies, all changes are changes of degree or mode, not substance.\n\nFor Conway body is, therefore, not a substance distinct from spirit,\nbut both are modes of the same created substance differentiated only\nby relative density. Conway uses the metaphor of light and dark to\nexpress the difference between them, light being associated with\nspirit (soul) and darkness with body. In the scale of being, the\nhigher creatures are more active, spiritual and bright, while the\nlower creatures are on the scale, the less active and more corporeal\nand darker they become, though they never become completely dark. \n",
