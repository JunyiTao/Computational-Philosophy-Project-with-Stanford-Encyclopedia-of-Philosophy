    "preamble": "\n\nPhilippa Foot wrote many articles treating issues in metaethics, moral\npsychology, and applied ethics, as well as one monograph on moral\nphilosophy.  Throughout her career, she defended the objectivity of\nmorality against various forms of noncognitivism and tangled with\nissues of moral motivation, notoriously changing her mind about\nwhether moral judgments necessarily provide rational agents with\nreasons for action. To the wider world, and perhaps especially to\nundergraduate philosophy students, she is best known for inventing the\nTrolley Problem, which raises the question of why it seems permissible\nto steer a trolley aimed at five people toward one person while it\nseems impermissible to do something such as killing one healthy man to\nuse his organs to save five people who will otherwise die. Foot is\nalso known for contributing to the revival of Aristotelian virtue\nethics in contemporary philosophy, though it is less well known that\nshe emphatically disavowed being an adherent of this view as it is\ncurrently understood.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nPhilippa Foot was born Philippa Ruth Bosanquet on October 3, 1920,\nin Owston Ferry, Lincolnshire, and grew up in Kirkleatham, in North\nYorkshire, England. Her mother, Esther, was a daughter of U.S.\nPresident Grover Cleveland. Her father, William was an industrialist,\nrunning a large Yorkshire steel works. Foot studied philosophy,\npolitics, and economics at Somerville College, a women\u2019s college\nwithin the University of Oxford. Foot had no formal education as a\nchild; as she puts it, she \u201clived in the sort of milieu where\nthere was a lot of hunting, shooting, and fishing, and where girls\nsimply did not go to college\u201d (Voorhoeve 2009: 91). In her youth,\nshe was educated by governesses, from whom she claimed she did not\neven learn \u201cwhich came first, the Romans or the Greeks\u201d\n(Conradi & Lawrence 2010). Despite this poor childhood education\nFoot was able to secure a position at Oxford by way of a\ncorrespondence course on Latin and working with an Oxford entrance\ncoach.\n\nHer earliest philosophy tutor at Somerville was Donald MacKinnon, a\nphilosopher and theologian with an interest in Plotinus, Kant, and\nHegel. Elizabeth Anscombe, Mary Midgley, Iris Murdoch, all of whom\nwould go on to have celebrated careers in philosophy, were also at\nSomerville at the time. All four engaged philosophically with each\nother during their Somerville years and later (Hursthouse 2012: 182).\nFoot earned a BLitt from Somerville for her research on Kant in 1942,\nand then worked in London for the remainder of the war. At the end of\nthe war, she married the military historian M.R.D. Foot (though the\nmarriage came to an end in 1960) and returned to Somerville College to\ntake a teaching position and then, in 1949, began a fellowship there.\nG.E.M. Anscombe had started a research fellowship at Somerville in\n1946. Foot credits her introduction to analytic philosophy to\nAnscombe, who introduced Foot to a style of philosophy Anscombe picked\nup from Wittgenstein.\n\nFoot resigned her fellowship at Somerville in 1969 and began a period\nof freelancing in the United States, where she held Visiting\nProfessorships at the Universities of California, at Los Angeles and\nBerkeley, Washington, Princeton, Stanford, and the City University of\nNew York. In 1976, she took up a permanent position at the University\nof California, Los Angeles, where she remained until retiring in 1991,\nthen returning to Oxford, where she completed her monograph\nNatural Goodness. Foot\u2019s last philosophical article\nappeared in 2004, and she died on her ninetieth birthday, October 3,\n2010. It is sometimes thought that Foot was a founding member of\nOxfam, but, in fact, the first records of her involvement date from\n1948, some six years after the founding of the Oxford Committee for\nFamine Relief. She remained involved with Oxfam throughout her life\n(Hursthouse 2012: 180\u2013181).\n2. Ethical Naturalism in Foot\u2019s Early Writings\n\nIn a trio of early articles, Foot argues against then prevailing views\non the nature of moral judgments and sketches an alternative positive\nview. The views she argued against were known as emotivism and\nprescriptivism, both versions of noncognitivism. On these views, moral\njudgments feature a special attitudinal component, a pro or con\nattitude that is absent from straightforward descriptive claims. What\nthe judgments are about is irrelevant to whether they count as moral\njudgments. In \u201cMoral Arguments\u201d (1958), Foot memorably\npresents these views as offering a \u201cprivate enterprise theory of\nmoral criteria\u201d, which highlights the way in which these views\ntake the individual\u2019s attitude as settling the question of the\nscope of morality (1958 [VV 108]). In this line of argument, she demonstrates\na commitment to a Wittgensteinian approach and takes up some of\nWittgenstein\u2019s views. The idea that terms must have public\ncriteria and cannot be given arbitrary meaning by the individual\nspeaker is among these commitments, along with the approach to\ninvestigating terms by way of a \u2018grammatical\ninvestigation\u2019. That is an attempt to ground our understanding\nof words in an examination of how we in fact use them when we are\npractically engaged, which often gets lost when doing philosophy.\n\nThe noncognitivist views Foot attacks depend on a pair of assumptions\nthat Foot dismantles in her article \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d\n(1959). The first assumption is that what counts as evidence for an\nevaluative conclusion in no way depends on what anyone else counts as\nevidence. Foot thinks this would only be possible if the meaning of a\nterm such as \u2018good\u2019 possesses a separate evaluative\ncomponent, independent of any consideration of the proper object of\nthings deemed good. The second assumption is that anyone can refuse to\ndraw an evaluative conclusion in the face of what others regard as\ndefinitive evidence. For example, one guided by this assumption might\nadmit that there are grounds for calling Jones courageous, in that he\ndefended his family against a fearsome attacker, but refuse to praise\nJones for his courage. In that case, one might say he is\n\u2018courageous\u2019 only in a descriptive, inverted commas sense,\navoiding the evaluative commitment that this description usually\nentails. Together, these assumptions erect a wall between factual\njudgments and evaluative judgments, a wall which Foot proceeds to\ndemolish.\n\nAgainst the first assumption, Foot argues that the term\n\u2018good\u2019 is analogous to \u2018pride\u2019 in having\nlimits on its intelligible use. The analogy draws on the fact that the\nemotion of pride is evaluative, and yet tied to definite descriptive\ncontent: logically, one cannot feel pride about just anything. Rather,\nto feel pride in something is to see it as one\u2019s achievement;\nhence the object of pride is taken to a good that one had some hand in\nbringing about. For example, if I thought I had been awarded the prize\nfor best pumpkin and felt proud of this triumph, but it turned out\nthat it was in fact someone else\u2019s pumpkin which actually won, I\ncould not intelligibly continue to feel pride. Further, what one takes\npride in must be some sort of achievement or advantage. It would not\nmake sense to feel pride in laying one hand over another three times\nin an hour, unless there is a special background condition, such as a\nstroke, which made this a difficult task and an important step in\nrecovery. Foot argues thereby that to be said to be feeling certain\nemotions, it is not sufficient that one be in a certain mental\nstate.[1]\nRather, the person must stand in an appropriate relationship to a\nproper object of those feelings. In this way, Foot attempts to show\nthat \u201ceven feelings are logically vulnerable to facts\u201d\n(1959 [VV 115]).\n\nAnalogously, she thinks someone must stand in an appropriate relation\nto a proper object of \u2018good\u2019 to be said to think something\nis good. Foot asks us to consider someone who deems it good to always\nclasp one\u2019s hands three times in an hour. This person might\nclaim it is a duty to so clasp one\u2019s hands, praise others for\ndoing it and so on. Are these moral judgments? She maintains that to\ncall these moral judgments would require a special background; in this\ncase, the clasper\u2019s belief that such action has special\nsignificance or effect that pertains to the human good (1959 [VV\n120]). Foot contends that there is a logical impossibility in taking\nthe clasping to be morally good in the absence of any such\nbackground.\n\nAgainst the second assumption, that we might fail to draw an\nevaluative conclusion from what others regard as definitive evidence,\nFoot argues in \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d that we all have reason to\nact in view of what is demonstrated to be in our interests. If an\naction can be shown to be in our interests, we have reason to do it.\nSo, one can say, at least pro tanto, that we ought to do it,\nand would be irrational and bad not to do it, all else being equal.\nFoot then aims to show that cultivating the virtues is always in\none\u2019s interest, and failing to do so is necessarily against\none\u2019s interest. She thereby claims to show that we each have\nreason to cultivate the virtues, regardless of our present desires. In\nthe course of her argument, she attempts to refute the position\nadvocated by Thrasymachus in Plato\u2019s Republic, namely,\nthe view that it is more profitable to be unjust, a view which she\ncalls \u201cThrasymachus\u2019 thesis\u201d (1959 [VV 125]). So,\nshe aims to persuade us that justice, along with the other so-called\n\u2018cardinal virtues\u2019 of courage, prudence, and temperance,\nare in some sense profitable, even though these virtues may at times\nask us to make drastic sacrifices, even to the point of laying down\nour lives.\n\nFoot compares injustice with physical injury, focusing primarily on an\ninjury to our limbs. She believes that an injury, which impairs the\nfunctioning of some part of our bodies or creates lasting pain, is\nsomething we each have reason to avoid. That is, we want to avoid it\nfor itself, even though some circumstance may arise where there is a\nreason to want to sustain an injury because of some advantage which\ncan be realized through it (or, more commonly, we want to do something\nthat risks sustaining injury for the sake of some advantage).\nIn such circumstances, we can say that there are overriding or all\nthings considered reasons to sustain or risk an injury, but clearly,\nwe would avoid the injury if the gain could be realized without\nsustaining it. No rational person seeks an injury for itself, and\nevery rational person avoids injury for itself. An injury is something\nthat we should always want to avoid because it is a physical change\nwhich impairs the function of a particular body part, and we all have\nreason to want our bodies to function properly (1959 [VV\n116\u2013117; 122]). General facts concerning human beings support\nthe idea that it is necessary for rational people to want their limbs\nintact.\n\nSimilarly, she thinks that there are features of human life which\nexplain why it is rationally necessary for us to want the virtues. She\nargues that the virtues can be taken to be as essential to the\nfulfillment of our desires as are our limbs. Though we may choose to\nlive a life in isolation, or indeed though we may be stranded in\ninvoluntary isolation for any of various reasons, we are creatures who\ncan at present anticipate that our attempts at attaining things will\nhappen in a social environment. This means that we are creatures for\nwhom it is a constant fact that our attempts at fulfilling a desire\nmay be interfered with or enhanced by others. We can all expect to\nprofit if our actions instance a practice which is defined by mutual\nrespect and fidelity to promises, and this profit is one we all have\nreason to want given that our desiring things predictably occurs\nwithin a social matrix.\n\nFoot recognized one of the most obvious objections to this position,\nwhich is the \u2018tight corner\u2019. That is, while it may be\ngenerally beneficial to be just or courageous, in individual\ncircumstances it is difficult to claim that someone has reason to be\nvirtuous when, in doing so, they would incur a very great loss. On\nthis objection, it would seem rational to avoid developing the\ndisposition to be just in order to avoid incurring these losses. In\n\u201c Moral Beliefs\u201d Foot argued that by concentrating on the\ncosts of particular just acts in isolation, this object fails to\nrecognize the value of the general disposition to be just (1959 [VV\n129\u201330]). But later she cites the objection as a reason for her\nchange of view in \u201cMorality as a System of Hypothetical\nImperatives\u201d (VV x). Ultimately, the successful defense of her\nearly position on the rationality of morality depends on defending the\nview that we should not be focusing on the rationality of individual\nactions, but rather the rationality of adopting the disposition to be\njust.[2]\n\nIn arguing against her emotivist and prescriptivist opponents, Foot\ndevelops the outlines of a positive position that should be labeled a\nversion of ethical naturalism in view of the role that it accords\nfacts about human life in defining the content of morality. In\n\u201cWhen is a Principle a Moral Principle?\u201d (1954),\n\u201cMoral Arguments\u201d, and \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d, Foot\nmakes a case for a distinctive non-utilitarian naturalistic ethics in\nwhich the virtues play a central role and in which a trait is\njustified as a virtue by making a contribution to leading a good human\nlife. Her case for such an ethics is motivated by metaethical\nconcerns, specifically with her dissatisfaction regarding the ability\nof noncognitivist theories to offer an adequate account of\nmorality.\n3. Against Moral Rationalism\n\nAmong Foot\u2019s most anthologized, celebrated, controversial, and\nwidely cited articles is undoubtedly \u201cMorality as a System of\nHypothetical Imperatives\u201d (1972, MSHI). In this article, Foot\ntakes an about-face on the issue of the rationality of morality. In\nMSHI she retains the view from \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d that\nself-interest is rationally required: we must have desires for what is\nevidently in our self-interest or else we are irrational. Yet, she\ndrops the view that morality coincides with self-interest, and ends up\nwith the position that morality only provides reasons if we have\ndesires that we might rationally lack. Unfortunately, although Foot\nnotes her change of view, she does not revisit her previous position\nto argue at any length against her earlier\n view.[3]\n\nThe term \u2018hypothetical imperative\u2019 comes from Immanuel\nKant\u2019s moral philosophy, in which it is contrasted with the\n\u2018categorical imperative\u2019. A hypothetical imperative is a\ncommand, or ought-statement, that depends for its reason-giving force\non the agent having a certain purpose. For example, someone\u2019s\nability to say that I ought to purchase an airplane ticket to New York\ntoday typically depends on whether I have the purpose of going there.\nIf I lack that purpose, or give up on it, then there is no sense in\nwhich one could continue to maintain that I ought to buy the ticket.\nBy contrast, categorical imperatives do not depend on our possession\nof any special purpose for their reason-giving force; they have\nnormative authority for us regardless of our purposes. In MSHI Foot\nsets out to challenge the then widely held assumption that morality\nmust consist of categorical imperatives because whether something is\nyour moral obligation seems obviously not to depend on whether one has\na certain purpose or desire. She undertakes to show that the surface\ngrammar of moral judgments, stating what we ought morally to do, is\nmisleading; when we make claims about what someone ought morally to\ndo, we certainly appear to be making categorical claims. We tell\nchildren that they should not fib even when a successful fib would\nserve their overriding purpose of escaping blame or punishment. Yet\nFoot argues that this appearance is deceptive, making her case for\nthis point by drawing an analogy between morality and etiquette. \n\nEtiquette and morality are different in many ways, but they both tell\nus what we ought to do. In fact, as Foot points out, rules of\netiquette are usually presented in the same categorical form as moral\nconsiderations; etiquette tells us what must and must not be done,\nperiod. Imperatives such as, \u201cYou should not discuss\nmoney\u201d, or \u201cDon\u2019t make personal remarks\u201d use a\ncategorical form. Foot calls these \u201cnon-hypothetical uses\u201d\nof ought (1972 [VV 160]). Yet Foot takes it to be obvious that one can\nrationally ignore the rules of etiquette. Hence, the rules of\netiquette do not give me any reason to act on them unless I have the\npurpose of doing what I ought to do from the point of view of\netiquette. Of course, there is still a sense in which the rules of\netiquette are unconditional. I am \u2018gauche\u2019 if I flout the\nrequirements of etiquette, regardless of my purposes. Still, Foot\nthinks it cannot be said that I necessarily have reason to conform to\nthose rules, drawing the conclusion that \n\n\nif a hypothetical use of \u2018should\u2019 gave a hypothetical\nimperative, and a non-hypothetical use of \u2018should\u2019 gave a\ncategorical imperative, then \u2018should\u2019 statements based on\nrules of etiquette, or rules of a club would be categorical\nimperatives. (1972 [VV 160\u2013161]) \n\n\nYet these \u2018should\u2019 statements do not really give us\ncategorical imperatives. We therefore cannot trust the surface grammar\nof our \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018ought\u2019 statements to tell\nus whether we have a categorical or a hypothetical imperative.\n\nFoot sees the commands of morality as like those of etiquette. Though\nthey are stated in categorical form, there is no reason to think that\nsomeone who acts against them is necessarily irrational. It is\nperfectly plausible to think that they give reasons only if we have\nthe purpose of doing what we should do from the moral point of view.\nAs with etiquette, the claims of morality are, in some sense,\nunconditional: one does not escape being wicked simply by lacking the\npurpose of being moral. As Foot states, \n\n\nthe man who rejects morality because he sees no reason to obey its\nrules can be convicted of villainy but not of inconsistency. (1972 [VV\n161])\n\n\n\nThat is because such an amoral agent does not act against any purpose\nthat he has, and is therefore not irrational, though he is still\nimmoral.\n\nThe next question that Foot sets out to address is: what would be the\nimplications for morality if it turns out that rules of morality are\nhypothetical imperatives? Many think that this would be a catastrophic\nsituation. Kant, for example, thought that if morality were merely\nhypothetically imperative, we would only be moral when it served\nselfish and pleasure-seeking purposes. Yet Foot argues that Kant had\nan inadequate view of human psychology, stating, \n\n\nQuite apart from thoughts of duty a man may care about the suffering\nof others, having a sense of identification with them and wanting to\nhelp if he can. (1972 [VV 165]) \n\n\nOf course, helping others with the purpose of promoting one\u2019s\nreputation for charity is not compatible with the virtue of charity,\nbut one can simply desire to help others, and in that case, there is\nno need for a categorical imperative to prompt the charitable\nacts.\n\nJustice, as Foot realizes, cannot be motivated by the same concern for\nthe good of others. Justice notoriously comes into conflict with the\ngood of others, as there may be cases where people would be\nwell-served by a false accusation or the redistribution of money owed\nto a rich man to the poor. This leads Foot to posit that just persons\nare concerned with truth, liberty and that they \u201cwant every man\nto be treated with a certain respect\u201d ([1972 [VV 165]). On Foot\u2019s\nview, then, a morally good agent has a variety of independent\ncommitments which make considerations of the well-being and the rights\nof others yield reasons. She evidently thinks this is a plausible\npsychological picture that has not been given sufficient\nconsideration, due to the assumption that morality consists of\ncategorical imperatives.\n\nAt the conclusion of MSHI, Foot makes an even bolder claim. She\nimagines that those resistant to her claim will think that we have a\nduty to adopt moral ends, yet she thinks that the idea that we have a\nduty to have certain ends is complete nonsense. It is of course\ntrivially true that we ought morally to have moral ends; so\nthat from the perspective of morally good people, these ends appear to\nbe obligatory. However, the objection suggests a use of\n\u2018ought\u2019 that is not tied to any particular institution,\npractice, or person\u2019s perspective, and she thinks it is merely\nan illusion that there is any such sense of \u2018ought\u2019 ([1972\n[VV 167]). In this respect, Foot claims she is offering a\n\u2018defictionalized\u2019 vision of morality (1975 [VV 174]).\n\nFoot\u2019s middle period views on the rationality of morality have\nspurred much debate. Her views of this period leave morality\nalarmingly unsupported: there is no reason to develop the desires that\nallow moral considerations in turn to provide us with reasons for\naction if we lack them. Prominent defenders of moral rationalism\ncriticize Foot\u2019s analogy with etiquette. Unfortunately,\nFoot\u2019s actual position is sometimes misrepresented in the\ndebate. It is sometimes thought that Foot adopts at this point a\nwholly conventional view of morality, by analogy with etiquette. Yet,\nFoot did not renounce her earlier view that morality has some\ndeterminate content, tied to facts about human life. Another feature\nof Foot\u2019s middle period views that often gets overlooked is her\ncontinuous commitment to rationalism about self-interest:\nconsiderations of self-interest always provides reasons, regardless of\none\u2019s\n desires.[4]\n This means that she is not a consistent externalist, since not all\nreasons need to be accompanied by a desire that we might lack. Rather,\nshe defends an externalism about the reasons generated by moral\nconsiderations only. So she does not, after all, think that all\nnormative statements generate only hypothetical imperatives. Still,\nmoral oughts are not supported by categorical imperatives of\nself-interest, according to Foot\u2019s views at this point in her\ncareer.\n4. Applied Ethics\n\nFoot was among the pioneers of writing on issues in applied ethics,\ntreating abortion and euthanasia. For reasons only made explicit in\nlater writings, Foot rejects consequentialist views of value,\nincluding utilitarianism. Charity, on her account, demands that we aid\nothers, but we cannot do so at the expense of violating rights to\nnon-interference, or negative rights. As Foot puts it, \u201cin so\nfar as a man\u2019s charity is limited only by his justice\u2026 he\nis not less than perfect in charity\u201d (1983 [MD 57]). But what\ndoes justice demand? For Foot, answering this question depends on\nfiguring out the scope of our moral rights, and this is a project that\nshe pursued by reflecting on various thought experiments, some of\nwhich have entered popular culture.\n\nConsider a pair of scenarios called Rescue I and Rescue II (1984 [MD\n80]). In both cases, we are driving a jeep along a sea shore and have\nthe chance to save various configurations of stranded people from an\nincoming tide. In the first case, we are about to save one person from\nthe tide, and spot five others whom we can save, but we cannot save\nboth. In Rescue II, we can save five, but to reach them we would for\nsome reason would have to run over one person, killing him. Foot\nbelieves that there is a morally significant difference between these\ncases. She thinks it is impermissible to save the five in Rescue II;\nwhereas it is permissible (at least) to save the five in Rescue I. On\nFoot\u2019s view, the significant difference lies in the fact that in\nRescue II, saving the five would require initiating a causal sequence\nthat kills one. In Rescue I, by contrast, saving the five is\npermissible because in this scenario we allow a deadly causal sequence\nthat we did not initiate to run its course. This is not to say that\nall instances of allowing deadly causal sequences to run their courses\nare permissible, or that the distinction between doing and allowing\nalways makes a difference to the moral status of an action. The claim\nis only that the distinction sometimes makes a significant moral\ndifference, as it does in this pair of cases. According to Foot,\n\u201cit takes more to justify an interference than to justify the\nwithholding of goods and service\u201d (1984 [MD 83]). At the very\nleast, this means that it is impermissible to kill one person to save\nanother.[5] This\ndistinction relates to the distinction between negative rights, rights\nto non-interference, versus positive rights, which obligate others to\nprovide some service. Negative rights would enjoin others not to\ninitiate a fatal causal sequence, and positive rights may give rise to\nan obligation to prevent a fatal causal sequence from running its\ncourse. Foot\u2019s contention is that negative rights carry greater\nweight than positive rights.\n\nIn \u201cThe Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of Double\nEffect\u201d, (1967) Foot raises a related case that has been the\nsubject of much subsequent discussion: a runaway trolley is headed\ntoward five people who will be killed by the collision, but it could\nbe steered onto a track on which there is only one person (1967 [VV\n23]).  Intuitively, it seems permissible to turn the trolley to hit\nand kill one person, but the problem is that it does not seem\npermissible to kill one to save five in cases like Rescue II. Why,\nFoot asks, can we not argue for the permissibility of killing one to\nsave five in those cases by appealing to the Trolley case? As we have\nseen, Foot argues that negative rights are generally stronger than\npositive rights. In Rescue II, we must violate someone\u2019s\nnegative rights to meet the positive rights of others, and this is\nimpermissible because the negative rights have priority over the\npositive rights that is not outweighed by five people\u2019s need for\nassistance. In Trolley, by contrast, we are not violating negative\nrights to meet positive rights; the situation pits the negative rights\nof the five against the negative rights of one, and both choices\ninvolve violating someone\u2019s negative rights. In such a case, it\nseems clearly preferable to minimize the violation of negative rights\nby turning the trolley (1967 [VV 27]).\n\nOn Foot\u2019s view, we are generally not permitted to do something\nto someone that would interfere with someone\u2019s negative rights,\nfor example, we may not steal someone\u2019s property; yet we may not\nbe required to actively secure their possession of it, that is, we may\nallow them to lose their property. Foot thereby defends a principle\nthat draws a moral distinction between doing and allowing; she also\ndefends a version of the doctrine of double effect, which states that\nit is sometimes permissible to bring about a result that one foresees\nas a consequence of one\u2019s action but does not intend that it\nwould be impermissible to aim at either as a means or an end (1985 [MD\n91]).  Foot believes that this principle is necessary because the\nprinciple of doing and allowing does not cover some morally\nsignificant distinctions. For example, consider a case in which we\npossess a certain drug, but only enough to either cure one person\nsuffering from a fatal condition, or to save five others who are\nsuffering from a milder, though still fatal case of the same\nillness. In such a circumstance, we can permissibly give the drug to\nthe five who are suffering from the milder form of the disease. If we\ncould save all six, we would surely do so. Clearly, we do not intend\nthe death of the one, though we foresee it as a consequence of our\nactions. On the other hand, it is not permissible to withhold a\nlive-saving drug from one to use his organs to save the lives of the\nfive others after he dies. In this case, the death of the one is an\nessential means to the achievement of the end and so his death is\nstrictly intended. Although in such a case I would be allowing someone\nto die rather than perpetrating a killing by my own agency, what I do\nis impermissible.  Only the doctrine of double effect captures the\ndistinction between these cases, on Foot\u2019s view. Yet the\ndoctrine of double effect cannot stand on its own, according to Foot;\nwe need both the principle of double effect and the principle of doing\nand allowing. After all, we can sometimes impermissibly initiate harm\nwith indirect intention.  She gives the example of wicked merchants\nwho knowingly sell poisoned oil: their intention is not to harm their\ncustomers, but only to turn a profit, yet they are clearly initiating\na harmful causal sequence.\n\nThese principles systematize non-consequentialist \u2018common\nmorality\u2019, and Foot puts these principles to use in her\ntreatment of abortion and euthanasia. Foot is skeptical of any attempt\nto resolve the abortion debate without settling the issue of whether\nand when the fetus has moral rights, and she regards this as an\nintractable issue (1984 [MD 87]). In this view, she takes sides\nagainst Judith Jarvis Thomson, who argued that some abortions are\npermissible even if we allow for the sake of argument that the fetus\nhas full moral status. Thomson argues by analogy: imagine that while\nwe sleep a group of music lovers stealthily attach to us a famous\nviolinist who is suffering from an ailment, and we uniquely can keep\nhim alive for roughly nine months, as he convalesces (Thomson 1971:\n48). The question is: may we detach the violinist, causing his death?\nThomson argues that we may, since our negative rights have been\nviolated and no one has the right to use another\u2019s body, even to\nsave his own life. Of course, the analogy here is limited to cases of\nnon-consensual impregnation, such as those resulting from rape.\n\nFoot argues that the analogy has a devastating fault. There is a\nmorally significant difference between unhooking someone from\none\u2019s own body, which does not involve initiating a fatal causal\nsequence, since the person was already in the grips of a fatal\ncondition before being hooked up to us, and abortion, which does\ninitiate a fatal sequence. Foot believes that this makes abortion seem\nlike Rescue II, whereas the unhooking of the violinist is like Rescue\nI. As Foot puts it, \n\n\nthe fetus is not in jeopardy because it is in its mother\u2019s womb;\nit is merely dependent on her in the way children are dependent on\ntheir parents for food. (1984 [MD 87]) \n\n\nRejecting Thomson\u2019s view, which attempts to show that some\ninstances of abortion are permissible even if the fetus is fully a\nmoral person, Foot\u2019s considered position on abortion is that it\nturns on precisely the issue Thomson wishes to set aside. On this\nissue, she rather surprisingly abandons her commitment to objectivity,\nclaiming that it is a matter for a community to decide whether to\ncount the fetus as a human being (1970 [MD 7]).\n\nPerhaps Foot\u2019s most penetrating article on applied ethics is her\n\u201cEuthanasia\u201d (1977). Foot defines euthanasia as a killing\nthat is for the good of the individual in question, and she asks\nwhether such an act can ever be permissible. One central question here\nis whether it can ever be good for an individual to be deprived of his\nlife, and hence one of Foot\u2019s central purposes is to determine\nwhat sort of a good life is for a person. She rejects the narrowly\nhedonistic view that the value of life is determined by the balance of\npleasure versus pain it promises. On her view, life is often still a\ngood to someone who is suffering and who is likely to continue in such\na state. Yet she also argues that merely being alive without suffering\nis not a good (1977 [VV 42]). What is of value, on her view, is the\nordinary human life that contains at least a minimum of \u201cbasic\nhuman goods\u201d, which include: \n\n\nthat a man is not driven to work far beyond his capacity; that he has\nthe support of a family or community; that he can more or less satisfy\nhis hunger; that he has hopes for the future; that he can lie down to\nrest at night. (Ibid.) \n\n\nIn the absence of such minimal goods, she argues that life is not a\ngood to a person.\n\nThe issue of the permissibility of euthanasia for Foot, then, turns to\nissues about justice and charity (1977 [VV 44]). On her view, even\nwhen it seems better for someone not to survive, we must respect that\nperson\u2019s rights. Hence, on her view, involuntary active\neuthanasia can never be permissible. On the other hand, the right to\nassistance in staying alive calls upon the charity of others and not\njustice, except in the case of a doctor who has a contractual duty to\nhelp keep us alive. Yet even in the case of a doctor, where assistance\nis a matter of justice, our claim on that assistance is limited by the\nclaims of others as well as a regard for our well-being. That is,\nthere may come a point at which such \u2018assistance\u2019 as a\ndoctor can offer to prolong a patient\u2019s life does not actually\nconfer any benefit, and in such a case, it is not contrary to justice\nor charity for the doctor to withhold treatment; as Foot points out,\nsuch instances of passive euthanasia are already widely practiced (1977 [VV\n56]). However, she argues that it may be justifiable not to prolong the\nlife of someone who wants to live, giving the example of a dying\nsoldier whose life could be prolonged with a certain drug, but who\nwould thereby face death by starvation. According to Foot,\nnonvoluntary passive euthanasia is permissible in such an\ninstance.\n\nOf course, the central controversy here is whether voluntary active\neuthanasia is permissible. She dismisses James Rachels\u2019 claim\nthat if we permit passive euthanasia then the only consistent position\nis to permit active euthanasia in similar circumstances because it is\n\u2018more humane\u2019 than passive euthanasia (Rachels 1975). Foot\nargues by analogy that it may be \u2018more humane\u2019 to deprive\nsomeone of property that is bringing evil to him, but nevertheless\ntaking it away would be contrary to justice (1977 [VV 50]). On the\nother hand, someone may give permission for the destruction of his\nproperty, and as Foot concludes, \n\n\nIf someone gives you permission to destroy his property it can no\nlonger be said that you have no right to do so, and I do not see why\nit should not be the same with taking a man\u2019s life. (1977 [VV\n53]) \n\n\nNevertheless, Foot admits that the moral issue is not entirely\nresolved by the matter of rights, so it does not follow that there is\nno moral objection to doing something because it would involve no\nviolation of rights. It is then a matter of whether it would be good\nfor the person to die and, hence, whether it would be contrary to\ncharity. This rules out cases in which death is wished for by someone\nwho is facing a life of dependency because they are worried about\nbeing a burden on others. In such circumstances, other things being\nequal, the death would not be for the good of the person. Foot also\nhas concerns about the practice of euthanasia that make her hesitate\nto suggest that the practice ought to be more widely legalized.\n5. Virtue and Morality\n\nIn her treatment of abortion and euthanasia, Foot appeals to virtues\nof charity and justice. It is obvious, then, that the virtues play an\nimportant role in her conception of morality. On Foot\u2019s account,\nthere are three essential features of a virtue: first, a virtue is a\ndisposition of the will; second, it is beneficial either to others, or\nto its possessor as well as to others; third, it is corrective of some\nbad general human tendency.\n\nFoot starts her investigation of the connection between the virtues\nand the will by examining the role of intentions in determining\nsomeone\u2019s character. We evaluate someone\u2019s moral quality,\nshe thinks, primarily by examining his intentions (1978 [VV 4]). Yet,\ngood intentions are not sufficient to demonstrate that someone is\nvirtuous; in the case of charity or benevolence, one can show lack of\ncharity despite our good intentions, in failing to bring about the\nintended good. For example, one can be ignorant of something one\nshould have known, as famously illustrated by Foot with her example of\nfailing to learn basic first aid. Someone who is genuinely benevolent\nwill take the trouble to find out about basic first aid, and because\nsuch knowledge is so easily attained and so generally useful to\nothers, it shows a lack of charity to fail to attain such\nknowledge. Also, Foot points out that failures of performance can\ncount against someone\u2019s claim to possess virtue despite good\nintentions when one\u2019s heart is not in the action. Virtues are\ntherefore also \u2018dispositions of the heart\u2019 according to\nFoot, meaning that we must take the trouble to cultivate the desire to\nact well.  Conversely, virtue par excellence occurs in one\nwho is \u201cprompt and resourceful\u201d in doing good (Ibid.). A\nvirtuous agent will take pleasure in doing good things for others, and\nso for Foot, the will includes our intentions as well as our\n\u2018innermost desires\u2019.\n\nThere are plenty of qualifications to add here. Surely it is not\nalways in our power to effect changes in our emotions and desires; at\nleast, whether it is possible is an open question and subject to\npsychological inquiry (Hursthouse 1999: 113\u2013119). Still, Foot\nhas made a conceptual claim that is important here: we are charitable\nwhen our intentions and desires, to the extent that these are\nunder the control of our will, are such that we can act for the\ngood of others with ease and pleasure. If, due to a psychological\ncondition that is unresponsive to treatment, we cannot take joy in\nhelping others, then this does not count against our possession of\nvirtue. In fact, Foot thinks that such cases increase \u201cthe\nvirtue that is needed if a man is to act well\u201d (1978 [VV\n14]). But we must tread carefully here, for she does not mean that one\nin such a circumstance is necessarily more virtuous than one who is\nnot. Yet, facing a condition such as depression may test our virtue;\nits onset may lead one to fail to act in accordance with virtue, where\nan equally virtuous non-depressed agent would succeed. To speak more\ngenerally, some people will find themselves in circumstances,\npsychological or social, that will make greater demands on their\ncommitment to goodness.[6] This means that those who have a relatively\neasy time acting courageously or benevolently simply have not had\ntheir commitment to goodness tested in the same way as someone who\nfaces psychological obstacles. Those who face such obstacles\nmust show more virtue, though they are not necessarily more\nvirtuous than those in more ideal circumstances.\n\nThe virtue of wisdom presents another set of problems for the\nconnection of virtue with the will, which is essential to Foot\u2019s\naccount. Unlike other virtues, wisdom seems primarily to be an\nexcellence of the intellect rather than the will. Yet Foot argues that\njust because a putative virtue concerns the intellect does not mean\nthat the will is not also essential to it. For her, wisdom has two\ncomponents. First, it includes knowledge of the all-purpose means to\nvery general good ends. She includes here ends such as\n\u201cfriendship, marriage, the bringing up of children, or the\nchoice of ways of life\u201d (1978 [VV 5]). Such knowledge is within the\nreach of anyone who wants it, since one need not be especially clever\nin order to acquire it and, in this way, it is unlike specialized\nscientific knowledge, which is something within the grasp of a lucky\nfew who possess the necessary talent and opportunity to pursue it.\nThis means that the knowledge involved in wisdom is within the scope\nof the will: we can get it if we want it, and therefore we can in\nfairness be evaluated for our success or failure in its\nrealization.\n\nThe second part of wisdom, according to Foot, consists of knowing the\nworth of particular ends, something which she claims is difficult to\ndescribe. Here she has in mind the knowledge involved in realizing\nthat a life spent in the pursuit of wealth or fame at the expense of\ngood relationships is, in fact, a wasted life. This aspect of virtue\nis a matter of forming judgments about what is worthwhile in life, and\nshe thinks one can make false judgments about these matters. One\nwonders here how having a false view of what is worthwhile in life can\nbe a matter that is under the control of one\u2019s will. Yet Foot\nbelieves that there is a connection with the will here as well,\nstating, \n\n\nWisdom in this second part is \u2026 to be described in terms of\napprehension, and even judgement, but since it has to do with a\nman\u2019s attachments it also characterises his will. (1978 [VV\n7])\n\n\nThus, there is a case that the moral virtues, including wisdom, are\nvirtues of the will construed\n broadly.[7]\n The second feature is that the virtues are beneficial to their\npossessor or to others. As mentioned above, Foot in her early work\nembraces the view that the virtues necessarily benefit their\npossessors. She abandons that view in her middle period in favor of\none in which the virtues are beneficial \u201cin some general\nway\u201d (1978 [VV 2]). The benefit of the virtues may go to both their\npossessors and to others, or else exclusively to others. Courage,\ntemperance, and wisdom fall in the first category, benefiting both\ntheir possessors and others. She believes that charity and justice\nsometimes fall in the second category because they sometimes require\ntheir possessors to sacrifice everything (1978 [VV 3]). Justice, as she\nnotes, poses the biggest problem for the idea that virtues necessarily\nbenefit their possessors (1978 [VV xv, 3]). Yet, it is also unclear that\njustice necessarily benefits others, at least on any given occasion;\nsurely there are cases in which we could benefit someone by means that\ninfringe her rights, just as there are clearly occasions in which we\ncan do great benefit for many others, but only by violating\nanother\u2019s rights. So, there are no doubt occasions on which the\ndemands of justice require that we renounce certain benefits that we\ncould otherwise provide to others. But Foot seems to think that\noverall, it is beneficial for a society to consist of just\nindividuals. As she states, \n\n\ncommunities where justice and charity are lacking are apt to be\nwretched places to live, as Russia was under the Stalinists, or Sicily\nunder the Mafia. (1978 [VV 3]) \n\n\nIn this qualified sense, then, the virtues are good in that they are\nbeneficial.\n\nFoot raises the question of whether virtue always results in good\naction and, in \u201cVirtues and Vices\u201d (1978), she affirms\nthat it does. One difficulty is to account for the appearance that\nsomeone who is engaging in a bad action may still exhibit a virtue.\nShe gives the example of a fearless murderer: does the fearless\nmurderer exhibit courage? Foot thinks that the appearance that he does\nis misleading. She allows that we may be inclined to say that an act\n\u2018took courage\u2019 or to speak of the \u2018courage of the\nmurderer\u2019, but we still resist calling it a \u2018courageous\nact\u2019 or an \u2018act of courage\u2019. In \u201cVon Wright on\nVirtue\u201d (1989), Foot adds that we may be willing to describe an\naction as an \u2018act of courage\u2019 in cases where \n\n\nthe evil end is distant from the action concerned, as when, for\ninstance, a man does something to save his own life or that of his\ncompanions in the course of some wicked enterprise, such as an unjust\nwar. (1989 [MD 114]) \n\n\nShe believes this implies that courage is more than a simple mastery\nof fear; instead, it is mastery of fear in the context of the pursuit\nof good ends. Therefore, courage overlaps with daring and boldness,\nbut since the latter conditions may exist in the absence of any\ncommitment to goodness, they are not identical with the virtue of\ncourage. We may say, instead, that the mastery of fear is a necessary,\nbut not a sufficient, condition for the possession of courage.\n\nFoot\u2019s arguments attempt to show that the virtues are beneficial\nqualities that produce good actions. One might think that this should\nbe enough to establish that the virtues make one a good human being,\nbut one more step is needed as it is not yet clear whether the virtues\nare necessary for one to be a good human being. Foot argues that the\nvirtues are needed for humans as a corrective to general human\ncharacteristics that make it difficult for us to act well. In the case\nof virtues such as courage and temperance, it is rather obvious that\nwe are susceptible to feeling fear in ways that make it difficult for\nus to achieve worthwhile goals, and that similar difficulties are\nposed by the temptations of pleasure. In the cases of charity and\njustice, there are deficiencies of motivation due to the fact that we\nare generally not as attached to the well-being and rights of others\nas we are to our own (1978 [VV 9]). These tendencies are general, and\nneed not be exhibited in individual cases (1978 [VV 10]). As I noted\nabove, some individuals might find it relatively easy to exhibit\ncertain virtues, yet this is just an aspect of the circumstances of\ntheir lives, and it counts neither for nor against their possession of\nvirtue, and it does not matter for the purpose of determining whether\nthe virtues make one good qua human.\n\nSince no disposition of the will can count as a virtue unless it is a\ncorrective, according to Foot\u2019s view in her middle period,\n\u201ceverything is seen to depend on what human nature is\nlike\u201d (1978 [VV 10]). She clearly believes that the traditional\ncardinal virtues (courage, temperance, justice, charity, and wisdom)\ndeserve a place among the virtues as she construes them. Still she\nadmits:\n\n\nIt is possible\u2026 that the traditional list of the virtues and\nvices puts too much emphasis on hedonistic and sensual impulses and\ndoes not sufficiently take account of less straightforward\ninclinations such as the desire to be put upon and dissatisfied, or\nthe unwillingness to accept good things as they come along.\n(Ibid.)\n\n\nOn Foot\u2019s view, then, our theory of human nature must be taken\ninto account in our moral theorizing, and we must acknowledge as well\nthat our theory of human nature is open to revision.\n\nOn Foot\u2019s view, the goodness that is realized in possessing the\nvirtues extends beyond moral goodness; for example, she argues that\none may show courage in confronting something fearsome for the sake of\none\u2019s own life (1989 [MD 115]). The idea here, which she develops in\nher later work, is that one does not act well in neglecting\none\u2019s own interests, just as one who neglects the rights or\nwell-being of others is defective. Human goodness encompasses more\nthan moral goodness, and the virtues are connected with human goodness\nthus broadly understood.\n\nIt should be noted that, although Foot obviously made significant\ncontributions to the development of neo-Aristotelian virtue theory,\nshe explicitly disavowed allegiance to virtue ethics (RG 2). Her\nreasons for distancing herself from virtue ethics are somewhat\nobscure, and possibly misconstrue philosophers who advocate views\nunder that heading, but it seems from her writings on the nature of\nmorality that she considers morality something apart from virtue,\nsomething that is determined by an idealized, contractual moral code.\nHence, she endorses the attempts of John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon to\ndevelop social contract approaches to morality (1985 [MD 103]).\n6. Natural Goodness\n\nFoot\u2019s monograph Natural Goodness (2001, NG) and her\nlate essays take up a new approach to the problems she confronted\nthroughout her career. In her final published essay,\n\u201cRationality and Goodness\u201d (2004, RG), Foot discusses the\ncase of a farm boy from the Sudetenland who chose to die rather than\nto serve the\n Nazis.[8]\n In a letter to his family he writes, \n\n\nWe did not sign up for the SS, and so they condemned us to death. Both\nof us would rather die than stain our consciences with such deeds of\nhorror. (RG 2; see Gollwitzer et al. 1956) \n\n\nWith regards to this situation, Foot asks, \n\n\nWas this a rational choice? On what theory of practical\nrationality\u2014of the rationality of choices\u2014can this be made\nout? (RG 2)\n\n\nShe believes she has found a new approach that shows the Sudetenland\nboy\u2019s choice to be rational, and that it would be rational for\nany similarly situated human agent to make that choice. This\nconstitutes a second reversal of her view on this subject. In her late\nperiod, she believes that she erred in her middle period by embracing\na mistaken view of reasons for action. Her middle period view falls\ninto a category of instrumentalist theories of reasons for action. On\nsuch views, genuine reasons for action advance the fulfillment of our\ndesires or our interests. Foot came to think that these views are open\nto a serious objection that was pointed out by Warren Quinn, who\nargues that on such instrumentalist conceptions of reasons for action\nwe can be rationally shameless. These views tell us that an agent is\nrational when she acts on reasons that maximize the fulfillment of her\npreferences or interests, and it bids us to do that without regard to\ntheir content. The consequence of this view is that those with nasty\npreferences are advised by such views of practical rationality to\nmaximize the fulfillment of those preferences (Quinn 1994: 216). This\nsits awkwardly with the idea that rationality is something that is\nsupposed to guide our action.\n\nFoot proposes that we reject the demand that moral actions fit with a\npreconceived notion of practical rationality, such as a\ndesire-satisfaction conception, and, instead, we ought to adopt the\nview that moral considerations are one set of considerations that\ngenerate reasons, among others kinds of considerations that a rational\nagent must take into account (NG 11). After all, if practical\nrationality is held to be an authoritative guide to action as well as\na virtue, surely practical rationality must require an agent to take\naccount of the moral features of ends. Whether or not practical\nrationality requires taking account of those features is clearly\npertinent to whether it is a genuine virtue, much less a master\nvirtue. This argument suggests that our standards of rationality\nshould derive from our standards for goodness of the will, rather than\nthe other way around. On this view, our conception of practical\nrationality must fit within our overall conception of the human good.\nFoot believes that we can see such an approach at work in the way we\nreject present-desire theories of reasons for action. We commonly\nthink that someone who puts her future at risk for the sake of some\ntrivial, transient desire is behaving foolishly. As Foot writes, \n\n\nBeing unable to fit the supposed \u2018reason\u2019 into some\npreconceived present-desire-based theory of reasons for action, we do\nnot query whether it really is a foolish way to behave, but rather\nhang onto the evaluation and shape our theory of reasons accordingly.\n(NG 63)\n\n\nMoral reasons are of course not the only reasons to which we must\nrespond to be rational agents. Foot believes that moral\nconsiderations, such as those of justice and charity, are on par with\nself-interest and desire-fulfillment. She also believes that there are\nconsiderations of family and friendship that provide a separate\ncategory of reasons for action (RG 8\u20139). A judgment about what\nis practically rational requires weighing these various\nconsiderations, and she concludes, \u201cIt is not always rational to\ngive help where it is needed, to keep a promise, or even\u2026\nalways to speak the truth\u201d (NG 11). Hence, moral reasons are not\noverriding. For example, a soldier may lie to save himself when in the\nhands of an enemy (RG 7). Even considerations of desire fulfillment\ncan trump moral considerations, as, for example, an insignificant\npromise may be overridden by an unexpected opportunity to fulfill a\nlong-held desire.\n\nFor the case of the Sudetenland farm boy, the result of Foot\u2019s\nview is that we need not demonstrate that his decision to embrace\ndeath rather than serve the Nazis is in his best interest or serves\nhis strongest desires. Of course, there is a certain sense in which he\nwould rather die than serve the Nazis, but, as Foot points out, he\nneed not lack a strong desire to live for his action to count as\nrational. As she writes, \n\n\nIf, according to a particular theory of rationality, a good action\nsuch as his seems dubiously rational, then so much the worse, not for\nthe judgment, but rather for the theory. (RG 6) \n\n\nShe returns to the view that there are different sets of\nconsiderations that have the ability to justify and explain actions.\nIn her early work, Foot apparently appeals to intuitions about what we\ncount as reasons for action, though in her late work she adds to this\naccount a framework for assessing which considerations possess this\nindependent rationalizing status. She believes that the human will\nmust be assessed against the background of facts concerning human\nlife, especially against facts about what humans need. As Foot puts\nit, \u201cthe evaluation of human action depends\u2026 on essential\nfeatures of specifically human life\u201d (NG 14). On Foot\u2019s\nview, then, our conception of practical rationality is inevitably tied\nto what is good for human beings, and must answer to facts concerning\nwhat is good for human beings as a species. We must take certain facts\nabout the human condition into account and then we will see that these\nfacts provide the basis for a case in favor of virtues, including,\nmost importantly for Foot, justice and charity.\n\nThe leads to the second central idea of Foot\u2019s late work is that\nmoral goodness is a form of what she calls \u2018natural\ngoodness\u2019. That is, moral goodness is an aspect of what makes us\ngood as human beings. In this idea, she is developing a strain of\nthought present in some of her early writings such as \u201cGoodness\nand Choice\u201d (1961), where she defends the idea that there are\nobjective features of living things that make them good as members of\ntheir species. She argues against Hare that there is a sense of\n\u2018good cactus\u2019 that is not merely a matter of preferences\nthat we have in cacti: there are features of a good cactus that depend\non what it is to flourish as a cactus (1961 [VV 141]). That is, a blighted,\ndamaged, or otherwise unhealthy cactus is not, in this sense, a good\ncactus. This notion of \u2018natural goodness\u2019 is developed in\nher late work, where she claims that virtue makes humans good in the\nsame way that blight-free, lush green flesh in a certain shape makes a\ncactus good. The norms which determine what makes something a good\nmember of its kind she calls \u2018natural norms\u2019.\n\nIn Natural Goodness Foot makes the claim that natural norms\nare essential to the identification of anything as an organism: to\nidentify something as an organism is ipso facto to view it\nfrom a normative standpoint. We can look at an organism as an ordinary\nphysical system, but to do so is to miss its biological nature. There\nare two premises to her argument for this point: first, grasping\nsomething as an organism requires us to situate the organism against\nthe background of its species, and second, to situate an organism\nagainst the background of its species requires us to consider it from\na normative perspective. The first premise draws on Michael\nThompson\u2019s work on living things. On that account, identifying\nsomething as an organism situates it within the \u2018wider\ncontext\u2019 of its kind. As Thompson puts it, \n\n\nIf a thing is alive, if it is an organism, then some\nparticular vital operations and processes must go on in it from time\nto time\u2014eating, budding out, breathing, walking, growing,\nthinking, photosynthesizing. (Thompson 2008: 56) \n\n\nBut nothing can fall under these descriptions when understood only in\nterms appropriate to a non-living physical thing. Consider, for\nexample, the case of eating: for an organism to be regarded as eating\nsomething, one must take it to be ingesting that which is normally\nnutritious for its kind, as well as absorbing it in such a way as to\nderive nutrition from it. Otherwise, we could not say that we\nwitnessed an organism eating something, but instead we would be\nobserving a fortuitous occurrence whereby an organism takes in some\nsort of material which happens to further its life (Thompson 2008:\n57). Only against the background of a life form, which determines a\nbackground of norms for understanding the doings of an instance of\nthat form of life, can the activities of an organism be understood as\neating, or any other vital activity (Thompson 2003).\n\nOn this account, we can see that all living things exhibit, in various\nways, a special kind of agency (Thompson.2008: 43) The growth of a\nfern is essentially different from the growth of a non-living thing\nsuch as puddle of rainwater or a trash heap, as the fern brings about\nits own growth by a process of cell division. Also, we can provide a\ndescription of how such a process should advance, and recognize when\nit has gone awry, whereas there is no question of the growth of a\ntrash heap going wrong. The growth of a fern differs from that of a\nrhododendron, even though they both exhibit the same sort of agency\ncharacteristic of living things. We must, in principle, be able to\ndiscern the growth of the fern from a growth on the\nfern that is due to blight, for example, and such discernment requires\na conception of how the fern\u2019s life should progress. Hence, the\nvital operations that characterize something as an organism are\nintelligible only against the background of a life form. A particular\norganism, then, is understandable only in its relation to its species\nand how an individual of that species characteristically lives; hence,\nit involves a rudimentary identification of the thing as functionally\norganized. Note that this is a logical claim about what is involved in\nidentifying something as an organism; the existence of life forms, in\nthe sense employed by Thompson, is not a contingent fact about the\ndevelopment of the present set of living organisms, as is the\nexistence of genera and of phyla. The existence of a life form is\npresupposed whenever we identify anything as an organism, be it the\nfirst or the last of its kind.\n\nTo situate an organism against the background of the characteristic\nfunction of its kind is to consider it from a normative perspective.\nMore precisely, it is to assess that organism against what is normal\nfor organisms of its species, and in doing so we make a normative\nassessment. Of course, there are many variations that are possible\nwithin a species, and not every variation found in an individual will\ncount as a defect. As Foot points out, a blue tit can lack the patch\nof blue on its head without being hindered in living its life; this\nlack is not, then, a defect (NG 30). So, natural normativity involves\nsome recognition of the specific components that are crucial to\ncarrying out an organism\u2019s vital operations. We must note that\nto possess such insight we merely need to appreciate that the organism\nis functionally organized, which is precisely what occurs when we\nsituate an organism against the background of its species. This\nfurther implies that to consider an organism as such involves some\nrecognition (though possibly mistaken) of its needs.\n\nAs we have seen, to characterize something as possessing the agency\ndistinctive of living things requires bringing to bear norms for the\nlife form of that individual; this is no less true in our own case. Of\ncourse, humans are capable of various modes of living, and in light of\nsuch diversity, it is questionable whether there is any\ncharacteristically human life, and so, whether there is any univocal\nsense of \u2018good human\u2019. Foot acknowledges that humans are\nrational animals and she believes this characteristic introduces a\n\u2018sea change\u2019 in how we approach describing our own\nspecies; reasoning and the application of reasoning to action are\nfeatures which are evaluated in human beings. As Foot writes,\n\u201c[W]hile [non-human] animals go for the good (thing) that\nthey see, human beings go for what they see as\ngood\u201d (NG 56). We are capable of responding to reasons in a\ndistinctively explicit way, inasmuch as we act on some understanding\nof which things are good. In fact, it is precisely the application of\nreasoning to our action which interests us in ethical evaluation. Foot\nclaims that vices are defects in our responsiveness to reasons for\naction, which constitutes a sort of natural defect in humans, and,\nspecifically, individuals with vices have defective wills. Inasmuch as\nwe have the capacity to reason about how to act, we are subject to a\ndistinctive sort of evaluation; unlike other natural defects, which\nmay simply be the result of bad luck, we are responsible for our\nconception of how to act, and therefore can answer to rational\ncriticism of that conception.\n\nThus far, this view appears to build the foundations of ethics on the\nvery general characteristic of rationality, leaving aside other\naspects of our nature. If so, it will surely not advance the project\nof justifying the virtues, for such a view seems to lead us to the\nempty standard of acting in accordance with \u2018right\nreason\u2019. Yet as pointed out above, the appeal to human nature\nserves not only to tell us that we are rational, but also to\ndefine what it is to reason well. Neo-Aristotelian ethical\nnaturalism, as Foot pursues it, must be understood as a thesis\nconcerning rationality, according to which practical rationality is\nspecies-relative. Our reasoning cannot ignore what we need as human\nbeings and yet still claim to exhibit practical rationality. Hence,\nFoot can claim that as rational animals we are freed from a certain\nkind of obedience to nature, while maintaining that nature has some\nnormative role for us; nature is normative over our reasoning, but not\ndirectly over our action. Foot states that human beings strive for\nwhat we see as good rather than the good that we see, as non-human\nanimals do; she adds that what we see as good is inevitably informed\nby a conception of our form of life. Making that conception explicit\nand subjecting it to criticism is an essential part of moral reform,\nfor ethical naturalists.\n\nDespite the diversity of lives that we can choose, Foot argues that\nhuman beings are vulnerable to deprivations that parallel natural\ndefects found in plants and animals. For example, human beings need\nthe mental capacity for learning language, understanding stories,\njoining in songs, and laughing at jokes (NG 43). Foot writes:\n\n\nIn spite of the diversity of human goods\u2014the elements that can\nmake up good human lives\u2014it is therefore possible that the\nconcept of a good human life plays the same part in determining\ngoodness of human characteristics and operations that the concept of\nflourishing plays in the determination of goodness in plants and\nanimals. So far the conceptual structure seems to be intact. (NG\n44)\n\n\nHowever, it is important to realize that Foot is not saying that our\nunderstanding of good human reasoning is to be based on a morally\nneutral, biological notion of flourishing. There is a straightforward\nmisreading of Foot\u2019s naturalism that misconstrues what is\nnatural about Foot\u2019s naturalism (Andreou 2006). These\nreadings take Foot to argue that moral goodness is crucial for human\nsurvival and reproduction.\n\nFoot argues that ethical naturalism need not define the aim of\npractical reasoning in terms of promoting what an individual needs for\nsurvival and reproduction in a narrow biological sense, and she\nexplicitly claims that she is not doing so. Rather, she believes that\nwe inevitably possess an understanding of what makes for a good human\nlife that informs our understanding of good human reasoning, and good\nhuman character in general. Structurally, this is how the\nparts of a plant are deemed good with reference to the flourishing of\na plant. But Foot does not mean to suggest that the\ncontent of norms of governing human reasoning and character\nmust be pegged to a notion of lush-green-leaves-and-deep-roots\nflourishing as adapted to human terms. Certainly, there are norms\ngoverning our assessment of human health, but there are also norms\nspecifying how events are suppose to proceed when we reason and act,\nand these norms cannot be equated with what promotes human health,\nsurvival or reproduction, except insofar as these are rationally\nchosen by humans. We do not hold survival and reproduction as\nsacrosanct values and therefore it is not always rationally chosen. We\nsee this reflected by the fact that justice and other virtues may\nrequire us to forgo having children, or even to lay down our lives.\nFoot clearly has these points in mind when she says: \n\n\nLack of capacity to reproduce is a defect in a human being. But choice\nof childlessness and even celibacy is not thereby shown to be\ndefective choice, because human good is not the same as plant or\nanimal good. (NG 42)\n\n\nIt remains to ask whether the account achieves its goals when it is\nunderstood as Foot intended. Can Foot show morality to be something\nwith a foundation in human nature, as she understands it? The account\nFoot gives is promising, yet also programmatic. Foot believes that the\nmoral virtues, together with prudence and virtues like friendship and\nloyalty that pertain to human relationships are justifiable on the\nbasis of facts about human life. But which facts matter and why should\nthey matter to us? If survival and reproduction are not the touchstone\nfor human goodness, then what is? And why should we care about what is\nnaturally good for humans? These are questions that proponents of\nFoot\u2019s later views continue to pursue.\n",
