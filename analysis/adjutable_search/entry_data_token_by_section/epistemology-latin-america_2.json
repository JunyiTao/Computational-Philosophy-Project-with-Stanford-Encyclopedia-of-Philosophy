    "main_text": "Core Epistemology\n3. Core Epistemology\n\nCore epistemology is concerned basically with the systematic analysis\nof knowledge and justified belief. So, in this section we will refer\nto works that examine fundamental epistemological concepts\u2014such\nas knowledge, truth, and justification\u2014or that defend or attack\ncertain general epistemological theories\u2014such as reliabilism and\nfallibilism.\n\nThe Instituto de Investigaciones Filos\u00f3ficas is where Luis\nVilloro (1922\u20132014) spent the bulk of his academic career. Born\nin Barcelona (Spain) to a Mexican mother and a Spanish father, and\nraised in Spain and Belgium, he settled in Mexico at the outbreak of\nthe Second World War and became a Mexican citizen. He did his\nundergraduate and graduate studies at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma\nde M\u00e9xico and spent research periods in France and Germany. In\n1982, he published the first analytically oriented book on\nepistemology written in Spanish: Creer, saber, conocer\n(Villoro 1982), translated into English as Belief, Personal, and\nPropositional Knowledge (Villoro 1998). Villoro examined\nfundamental concepts such as belief, knowledge, truth, objectivity,\nand epistemic communities. He distinguished between saber and\nconocer, which roughly correspond to what may be called\n\u201cpropositional\u201d and \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d,\nrespectively, the latter consisting in having direct experiences of a\ngiven object. S can assert that he has personal knowledge of\nx provided that he has the relevant personal experiences, but\nif S wants to justify to someone else the claim that he has\nsuch knowledge of x, S must show that he has\npropositional knowledge of his personal knowledge. Villoro seems to\nhave defended a form of epistemic relativism inasmuch as he claimed\nthat to know (in the sense of saber) that p is to\nbelieve that p, and to have objectively sufficient reasons to\nso believe\u2014an objectively sufficient reason being one that is\nconclusive, coherent, and complete\u2014but also maintained that what\nis considered as an objectively sufficient reason in one epistemic\ncommunity may not be so considered in another. For this reason, he\nclaimed that empirical knowledge is fallible: on the basis of the\nreasons that are objectively sufficient for any member of his\nepistemic community, S knows that p, but he cannot\nrule out the possibility that there might be contrary reasons\navailable to a different epistemic community that would undermine his\nknowledge that p. Objectively sufficient reasons are our best\nguarantee of empirical truths, but they do not of necessity imply such\ntruths (Villoro 1982: 180, 192). Villoro held that the view that all\nknowledge is socially conditioned is the only valid alternative to\nskepticism (1982: 164). He also proposed a surprising reform of the\ntraditional concept of knowledge: the notion of truth should not be\nincluded in the definition of knowledge because, even though the\nnotion of an objectively sufficient reason cannot be\nunderstood without the notion of truth, one may know that\np even if p is not true, for truth is not a\nnecessary condition for a reason to be objectively sufficient (1982:\nch. 8). (For a fuller overview of Villoro\u2019s book, see Cresto\n2010a: 474\u2013477.)\n\nVilloro\u2019s position has been criticized by Guillermo Hurtado (b.\n1962), a professor at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Mexico who\nobtained a B.A. in philosophy at this university as well as a B.A. and\na Ph.D. in the same field at the University of Oxford. Hurtado (2003)\nargues that Villoro\u2019s epistemic relativism and his redefinition\nof the concept of knowledge are the result of the fact that Villoro\ngrants the skeptic the unacceptable view that, in order to be able to\nclaim that one knows that p, one must have an infallible\ncriterion for knowing that one knows.\n\nEleonora Cresto (on whom see\n Section 2)\n has devoted some papers to examining core epistemological issues. For\ninstance, adopting a moderately Peircean perspective, she has called\ninto question the traditional picture of knowledge attribution\naccording to which one can attribute knowledge of p to\nS only if p is true and S is epistemically\njustified in believing in p. Cresto maintains that epistemic\njustification (understood either in internalist or externalist terms)\nis not always viewed as a necessary condition for knowledge,\nand hence as a necessary condition for making a correct knowledge\nattribution, according to our pre-theoretical usage of standard\nepistemic terms (Cresto 2018; cf. Cresto 2012: 928\u2013929).\n\nThere has also been some discussion of the concept of knowledge in\nterms of both reliability and fallibility. Let us begin with the\nformer. Succinctly put, reliabilism holds that a belief is knowledge\nif it is true and if it was produced, or is sustained, by a reliable\nprocess that yields mostly true beliefs. Reliabilist theories of\nknowledge require a reliable mechanism for belief formation, but do\nnot require that the epistemic agent be aware or have evidence of the\nmechanism\u2019s reliability. For this reason, reliabilism is a form\nof externalism. Juan Comesa\u00f1a (on whom see the previous\nsection) has proposed an original theory of epistemic justification\nthat combines elements of both reliabilism and\nevidentialism\u2014which represent two competing approaches in\ncontemporary analytic epistemology. This theory, which he calls\n\u201cevidentialist reliabilism\u201d, is intended to incorporate\nthe best aspects of both positions while avoiding the most serious\nproblems they face (Comesa\u00f1a 2010). Comesa\u00f1a has also\nargued that reliabilism is able to successfully deal with the\nso-called \u201cgenerality problem\u201d (Comesa\u00f1a 2006b),\nand that the epistemological problems stemming from lotteries either\nare not peculiar to reliabilism or can be solved by appealing to a\nprobabilistic account of reliability (Comesa\u00f1a 2009b). He has\nas well referred to reliability in his discussion of\n\u201csafety\u201d. Several epistemologists (such as Ernest Sosa,\nTimothy Williamson, and Duncan Pritchard) have defended the view that\nsafety is a necessary condition for knowledge. Roughly put, what that\ncondition says is that S knows that p if and only if\nS would believe that p only if p were true.\nOn the basis of a counterexample, Comesa\u00f1a (2005) has argued\nthat safety, as this notion has been defined by Sosa, is not actually\na necessary condition for knowledge. The reason is that, whereas\nreliability is plausibly a necessary condition for knowledge, reliable\nreliability is not, and whereas knowledge is compatible with\nunreliably reliable beliefs, safety is not. Hence, one can have\n\u201cunsafe\u201d knowledge. Comesa\u00f1a\u2019s more recent\nwork in collaboration with Matthew McGrath and Stewart Cohen has\nfocused on the part played by false beliefs in epistemology. He has\nargued that false propositions can be part of one\u2019s evidence or\ncan be reasons to do something (Comesa\u00f1a & McGrath 2014,\n2016) and, against Williamson, that one can have rational or justified\nfalse beliefs (Cohen & Comesa\u00f1a 2013a, 2013b,\nforthcoming).\n\nAs regards fallibilism, it is safe to say that nearly all present-day\nepistemologists are fallibilists: we sometimes make\nmistakes\u2014occasionally even about those things we deem to be most\nevident\u2014despite having good justification for our beliefs. More\nprecisely, S fallibly knows that p in case, despite\nthe good justification underlying one\u2019s knowledge,\nS\u2019s belief that p might have been false or\nmight have been accidentally true (cf. Reed 2002). Hurtado (2000)\nrejects such a virtually unanimous position\u2014which he defines as\n\u201cthe doctrine that any of our beliefs might turn out to be\nfalse\u201d\u2014on the grounds both that it is revisionist and that\nwe lack good reasons to accept it. Fallibilism is revisionist because,\nhe argues, it runs counter to common sense both by erasing the\nordinary distinction between those beliefs that cannot be false and\nthose that can, and by claiming that no evidence or no reasons can\nguarantee the truth of a given belief. And there are no good reasons\nto accept fallibilism because Hurtado claims to be able to refute what\nhe describes as the historico-pragmatic, epistemological, and ethical\narguments in its favor, and because he believes that fallibilism is\ndialectically weak against both skepticism and dogmatism.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that Claudio de Almeida (on whom see\n Section 2)\n has devoted part of his work to the so-called Moore\u2019s paradox,\narguing that none of the most influential analyses of the paradox\nprovides a successful solution to it, and proposing a solution of his\nown (de Almeida 2001, 2009). More recently, he has published on the\ndefeasibility theory of knowledge, arguing that a fallibilistic\nversion of this theory provides the correct solution to the Gettier\nproblem (de Almeida & Fett 2016, de Almeida 2017).\n\nWe should finally refer to the work of Carlos Pereda (b. 1944), even\nthough epistemology has not been the focus of his research. Born in\nUruguay, he obtained a B.A. in philosophy and educational sciences\nfrom the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica in his home country, as\nwell as a M.A. and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Universit\u00e4t\nKonstanz (Germany). He pursued most of his academic career in Mexico,\nfirst at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana and then at\nUNAM\u2019s Instituto de Investigaciones Filos\u00f3ficas. His work\nis mainly concerned with the nature and purpose of argumentation\n(Pereda 1994a, 1994b), and it is in this context that he deals with\ncertain epistemological subjects. For instance, he calls the rules\nthat govern the way in which the argumentative game is to be played\n\u201cepistemic virtues\u201d, which are character traits or\ndispositions of those involved in a debate, such as coherence, rigor,\nand willingness to consider one\u2019s rival theses. The exercise of\nthe epistemic virtues is what makes argumentation possible and what\nenables us to resolve conflicts of beliefs. Pereda also discusses what\nhe calls \u201cthe trilemma of knowledge\u201d (el trilema del\nsaber), which arises from the following three claims:\n\nWe know (understood in the sense that many of our beliefs are\nknowledge).\nWe are fallible (understood in the sense that any of our beliefs\nmay turn out to be false).\nS knows that p iff (a) S believes that\np, (b) p is true, (c) S is wholly justified\nin believing that p, and (d) between the fact p and\nthe belief that p there is an appropriate causal connection\nand S correctly reconstructs such a connection in her\njustification.\n\n\nThe trilemma emerges because, given that (3) formulates the concept of\nknowledge as infallible knowledge, only two of (1), (2), and (3) can\nbe held together: if (1) and (2) are true, then (3) is false (there is\nfallible knowledge); if (1) and (3) are true, then (2) is false (there\nis infallible knowledge); and if (2) and (3) are true, then (1) is\nfalse (there is no knowledge). Pereda maintains that the solution to\nthe trilemma is not to abandon one of the claims, but to recognize\nthat there is both a strong and a weak sense of the concept of\nknowledge. Pereda\u2019s view has been criticized by Guillermo\nHurtado (1996), who contends that the trilemma results from\nincorrectly analyzing (2), which should be understood not as the claim\nthat any of our beliefs may turn out to be false, but as the\nclaim that some of our beliefs may turn out to be false.\n",
