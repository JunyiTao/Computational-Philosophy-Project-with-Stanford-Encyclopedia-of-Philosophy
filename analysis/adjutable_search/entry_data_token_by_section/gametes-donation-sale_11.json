    "main_text": "Donor Anonymity || Policy Argument from Analogy to Adoption\n2.5 Policy Argument from Analogy to Adoption\n\nOffspring\u2019s ability to access adoption records have oscillated\nquite substantially over the past century and a half, even within the\nsame jurisdiction (Samuels 2000). More recently, regulatory structures\nhave shifted in favour of providing adoptees with a legal right to\naccess identifying information about their progenitors (Besson 2007,\nHildebrand 1999). In such jurisdictions, some have argued that,\nbecause gamete donation is sufficiently similar to adoption,\nregulatory consistency demands that anonymous gamete donation be\nprohibited as well (Pratten v. British Columbia (Attorney\nGeneral) 2012 BCCA 480; Chisholm 2012; Cahn 2009c \u2013 see\nOther Internet Resources). While this parity argument only goes so far\nin the absence of philosophical justification for prohibiting\nanonymous adoption (mere consistency could conversely be achieved by\npermitting anonymous adoption) it does give pause to examine the\nrelevant similarities between the two practices.\n\nThe core of the parity argument is that in both adoption and gamete\ndonation, children are reared by individuals other than their genetic\nprogenitors. If we think that access to information about genetic\nprogenitors is important enough to be elevated to the status of a\nright in adoption, then we ought to extend the same right to\ndonor-conceived individuals as well.\n\nIn response, Leighton has argues that there are important disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation such that there may be no\ninconsistency in prohibiting anonymity in one case but not the other\n(Leighton 2014). For instance, adoptees are generally relinquished by\ntheir initial parent(s), and are often not raised by either of their\ngenetic parents. In the case of gamete donation there is no similar\nrelinquishing of parenthood, and often one of the genetic parents is\nalso a social parent. These differences may very well result in\ndivergences in the experiences of adoptees and donor-conceived\nindividuals. For instance, adoptees might feel abandoned by their\ninitial parents, and be curious about why they were relinquished,\nsomething that is unlikely to be the case in gamete donation.\nFurthermore, Leighton argues that since adoption has a history of\nstigmatization in the West while gamete donation has no such history,\nthere is good reason to think that the psychological impact of\nanonymous adoption on adoptees will be different from the\npsychological impact of anonymous gamete donation on donor-conceived\nindividuals (Leighton 2014).\n\nWhile simply demonstrating that there are relevant disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation does not show that anonymity is\npermissible in the latter case but not the former, it does show that\nit is not outright inconsistent to have different policies governing\nanonymity for each.\n",
