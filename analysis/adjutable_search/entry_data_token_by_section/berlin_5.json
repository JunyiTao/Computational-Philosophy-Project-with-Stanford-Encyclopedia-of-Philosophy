    "main_text": "Philosophy of Knowledge and the Humanities || Free Will and Determinism\n2.4 Free Will and Determinism\n\nThe sort of historical understanding that Berlin sought to depict was\n\u2018related to moral and aesthetic analysis\u2019. It conceives of\nhuman beings not merely as organisms in space, but as \u2018active\nbeings, pursuing ends, shaping their own and others\u2019 lives,\nfeeling, reflecting, imagining, creating, in constant interaction and\nintercommunication with other human beings; in short, engaged in all\nthe forms of experience that we understand because we share in them,\nand do not view them purely as external observers\u2019 (1978b,\n173\u20134). For Berlin, the philosophy of history was tied not only\nto epistemology, but to ethics. The best-known and most controversial\nfacet of his writings on the relationship of history to the sciences\nwas his discussion of the problem of free will and determinism, which\nin his hands took on a distinctly moral\n cast.[7]\n In Historical Inevitability Berlin radically questioned\ndeterminism (the view that human beings do not possess free will, that\ntheir actions and indeed thoughts are predetermined by impersonal\nforces beyond their control) and historical inevitability (the view\nthat all that occurs in the course of history does so because it must,\nthat history pursues a particular course which cannot be altered, and\nwhich can be discovered, understood and described through laws of\nhistorical development).\n\nBerlin did not assert that determinism was untrue, but rather that to\naccept it required a radical transformation of the language and\nconcepts we use to think about human life \u2013 especially a\nrejection of the idea of individual moral responsibility. To praise or\nblame individuals, to hold them responsible, is to assume that they\nhave some control over their actions, and could have chosen\ndifferently. If individuals are wholly determined by unalterable\nforces, it makes no more sense to praise or blame them for their\nactions than it would to blame someone for being ill, or praise\nsomeone for obeying the laws of gravity. Indeed, Berlin further\nsuggested that acceptance of determinism \u2013 that is, the complete\nabandonment of the concept of human free will \u2013 would lead to\nthe collapse of all meaningful rational activity as we know it.\n\nThis is an extension into the realm of the understanding of human\nbeings of Kant\u2019s \u2018Copernican\u2019 revolution (to use\nKant\u2019s own epithet). Kant gave full recognition, for the first\ntime, to the inescapable contribution made by our minds to grasping\nthe non-human world; Berlin mirrors this move with a scarcely less\nfundamental claim of his own, that there are equally inescapable ways\nin which, at any given time or at all times known to us, we cannot but\nthink of and understand the behaviour and experience of our own\nkind.\n\nThe basic categories (with their corresponding concepts) in terms of\nwhich we define men \u2013 such notions as society, freedom, sense of\ntime and change, suffering, happiness, productivity, good and bad,\nright and wrong, choice, effort, truth, illusion (to take them wholly\nat random) \u2013 are not matters of induction and hypothesis. To\nthink of someone as a human being is ipso facto to bring all\nthese notions into play; so that to say of someone that he is a man,\nbut that choice, or the notion of truth, mean nothing to him, would be\neccentric: it would clash with what we mean by \u2018man\u2019 not\nas a matter of verbal definition (which is alterable at will), but as\nintrinsic to the way in which we think, and (as a matter of\n\u2018brute\u2019 fact) evidently cannot but think. (CC2 217)\n\n\nHere \u2018freedom\u2019 means the centrally important concept of\nfree will. We cannot help experiencing human behaviour as causally\nundetermined and freely chosen. That we have free will is not a\nscientific hypothesis, but a precondition of our experience of\nhumanity, to abandon which would leave our world-view in ruins.\n(Whether this entails that determinism is false is a further question,\nwhich Berlin does not fully confront; nor do we pursue it here.)\n\nBerlin also insisted that belief in historical inevitability was\ninspired by psychological needs, and not required by known facts; and\nthat it had dangerous moral and political consequences, justifying\nsuffering and undermining respect for the \u2018losers\u2019 of\nhistory. A belief in historical inevitability served as an\n\u2018alibi\u2019 for evading responsibility and blame, and for\ncommitting enormities in the name of necessity or reason. It provided\nan excuse both for acting badly and for not acting at\n all.[8]\n\nBerlin\u2019s insistence on the importance of the idea of free will,\nand the incompatibility of consistent and thoroughgoing determinism\nwith our basic sense of ourselves and our experience as human beings,\nwas closely tied to his liberalism and pluralism, with their emphasis\non the importance, necessity and dignity of individual choice. This\ninsistence involved him in a number of debates with other philosophers\nand historians in the 1950s and early 1960s, and helped to provoke a\nspate of writing in the English-speaking world on the philosophy of\nhistory, which might otherwise have languished.\n\nAlso controversial was Berlin\u2019s claim that the writing and\ncontemplation of history necessarily involves moral evaluation. He did\nnot, as some of his critics charged (e.g. Carr 1961), mean this as a\ncall for moralising on the part of historians. Berlin\u2019s argument\nwas that, first, our normal way of regarding human beings as agents\nwho make choices necessarily involves moral evaluation; to eliminate\nmoral evaluation from our thinking completely would be to alter\nradically the way that we view the world. Nor would such an alteration\ntruly move beyond moral evaluation; for strenuous attempts to be\nmorally neutral are themselves motivated by a moral commitment to the\nideal of impartiality. Furthermore, given the place of moral\nevaluation in ordinary human thought and speech, an account couched in\nmorally neutral terms will fail accurately to reflect the experience\nor self-perception of the historical actors in question. This last\nargument was particularly important to Berlin, who believed that\nhistorical writing should reflect and convey past actors\u2019\nunderstanding of their situation, so as to provide explanations of\nwhy, thinking as they did, they acted as they did. He therefore\ninsisted that the historian must attend to the moral claims and\nperceptions underlying historical events.\n",
