The Concept of Atonement and Conceptual Connections\n1.1 The Origin of the Word \u201cAtonement\u201d and its Uses\n\nThe words \u201catone\u201d and \u201catonement\u201d are derived\nfrom the expressions \u201cmake at one\u201d, and \u201cat\nonement\u201d. Usage of the latter phrase can be traced to as early\nas the 1300s in the writings of John Wycliffe (Hayes 1998). The word\nthus carries at its heart the notion of putting parties at\none\u2014unifying, or reconciling. The Oxford English Dictionary\noffers several definitions of atonement:\n\n\u201cthe condition of being at one with others\u201d\n(def. 1),\n\u201cthe action of setting at one, or condition of being set at\none, after discord or strife\u201d (def. 2),\n\u201creconciliation or restoration of friendly relations between\nGod and sinners\u201d (def. 3), and\n\u201cpropitiation of an offended or injured person, by\nreparation of wrong or injury; amends, satisfaction, expiation\u201d\n(def. 4).\n\n\nThe word applies both to relationships between non-divine people, and\nto relationships between God and non-divine people. Both kinds of\nrelationships can be damaged and require atonement for repair.\n\nThe definition of atonement in terms of making amends clarifies both\nnotions through the vivid imagery of a torn garment. As a whole\ngarment might become torn and require mending to repair, so a whole\nrelationship might become ruptured and require amends to repair. When\na garment is mended, the torn parts are brought back together into a\nwhole. Likewise, when proper amends are offered, the parties of the\nrelationship are brought back together into a whole\u2014they are\nmade at one, or reconciled. Making amends is thus an act of\natonement\u2014something done with the aim of reconciling the\nestranged parties.\n\nThe image of the torn garment suggests another feature of atonement:\nit typically involves a community. Society is often metaphorically\ndescribed as a garment, e.g., \u201cthe fabric of society\u201d.\nWhen a garment is torn, some threads within the garment are broken,\nsome parts of the fabric are disconnected. But the entire garment is\nalso said to be torn. So atonement can be given not just to reconcile\ntwo individual parties, but to reconcile an individual or a collective\nwith a collective.\n\nAlthough the word derives from English in the 1300s, the concept it\ndenotes is plainly much older. Early Greek literature contains the\nconcept of an atoning sacrifice (Hengel 1986; Versnel 2005). The book\nof Leviticus in the Tanakh describes various sacrifices the Hebrew\npeople were to offer, some\u2014most notably the sacrifices on the\nDay of Atonement, or Yom Kippur\u2014in order to atone for sin\nagainst God (Hayes 1998; Klawans 2006; Milgrom 1991). Various passages\nin the New Testament describe Christ as atoning for human sin (e.g.,\nRomans 3:23\u201325; 1John\n 2:2).[1]\n These passages state the famous Christian doctrine of\natonement\u2014the doctrine that through some of his deeds, including\nespecially his crucifixion,\n\n\nJesus acts in such a way as to remove the rift or division between\nhumans and God that is due to human sin in order to achieve\nreconciliation between humans and God. (Thurow 2021a: 239)\n\n1.2 Some Definitions\n\nThe word \u201catonement\u201d is defined around a paradigm series\nof events. First, there has been some offense or wrong that has been\ncommitted. Second, that offense is evident to the victim, who has as a\nresult become estranged from the offender. Third, something is\ndone\u2014paradigmatically by the offender\u2014to make amends for\nthe offense with the aim of propitiating the victim and achieving\nreconciliation. These amends are sometimes described as a reparation,\nsatisfaction, expiation, or sacrifice. Fourth, provided the amends are\nsuccessful, the victim forgives the offender and reconciliation\nresults. Different senses of \u201catonement\u201d pick out\ndifferent aspects of this series. Understanding atonement also\nrequires us to understand the other events in the series, such as\nforgiveness, reconciliation, and reparation, and how they relate to\natonement (see\n section 1.3).\n\nThere are non-paradigm cases of atonement as well\u2014for example,\ncases wherein (i) the victim is unaware they have been wronged, or\n(ii) the victim is aware of, but unconcerned about, having been\nwronged, or (iii) a third party makes or assists in making atonement,\nor (iv) amends seem not to require reparation, satisfaction, or\nsacrifice. Nevertheless, the following components seem essential to\natonement even in the non-paradigm cases: an offense or wrong has been\ncommitted and something is done with the aim of bringing about\nreconciliation. (For ease of expression, I will from now on usually\njust talk about wrongs being atoned for, however it should be\nunderstood that \u201coffense\u201d can be substituted for\n\u201cwrong\u201d in the following definitions. Although offenses\nhave a somewhat different moral profile from wrongs, they may also be\natoned\n for.[2])\n\nWe can now set out some plausible definitions.\n\n\nS atones for wrong R by doing A\n=defn S does A in order to reconcile the\nauthor and victim of R by removing or reducing the rift\nbetween them due to R, and A is successful in doing\nso.\n\n\n(See similar definitions in Eddy & Beilby 2006: 9; Daly 2009: 35;\nForsyth 1910 [1938: 54\u20138]; Hodges 1955: 9\u201310;\nO\u2019Collins 2007: 11; Paul 1960: 17\u201327; Rivi\u00e8re 1905\n[1909: 2\u20134].)\n\n\u201cAtones\u201d is defined so that the atoning act A is\nsuccessful in achieving the goal of bringing about reconciliation\nregarding the wrong. This seems consistent with common usage. However,\nwe also need a term for atoning that is neutral about whether success\nis achieved.\n\n\nS makes/offers atonement for wrong R by doing\nA =defn S does A in order to\nreconcile the author and victim of R by removing or reducing\nthe rift between them due to R.\n\n\nOne could offer atonement and yet fail to atone for one\u2019s\nwrongdoing. These definitions also allow that there are levels of\natonement: you fully atone if you erase the rift, and you partially\natone if you reduce the rift to various degrees. And one could atone\nfor one wrong, while not atoning for another wrong against the same\nvictim. Here the offender and victim would have reconciled regarding\nthe first wrong, but not the second. Finally, these definitions leave\nopen the possibility that a third party could atone on behalf of the\noffender.\n\nThere are two other closely related notions used by scholars that draw\nfrom the semantic range of the term. Linda Radzik, in perhaps the most\nextensive work on atonement in analytic philosophy, defines a notion\nof making amends:\n\n\nS makes amends for wrong R by doing A\n=defn by doing A S does whatever is\nmorally required to respond to having done R. (Radzik 2009:\n7)\n\n\nMaking amends is fundamentally a moral notion, whereas the above\nnotions of atonement are fundamentally relational. Radzik argues,\nhowever, that they are connected: making amends, if done properly,\nshould aim at a certain sort of reconciliation. Thus, one properly\nmakes amends, on her view, if and only if one offers atonement.\nFurther evidence for this view comes from the idea that atonement aims\nat undoing a wrong (Blocher 2004: 645; Swinburne 1989: 81\u201383).\nMaking amends arguably has the same\n end.[3]\n But even if this view of Radzik\u2019s is incorrect, making amends\nmay be well suited to, and often result in, making atonement.\n\nA third connected notion is atonement as expiation, or purification or\ncleansing (Craig 2020). We\u2019ll use the term\n\u201cexpiation\u201d to designate this notion:\n\n\nS expiates wrong R by doing A\n=defn A purifies or cleanses S of guilt\nfor having done R.\n\n\nExpiation is a prominent term in the ancient Jewish sacrificial system\nin which human sins (offenses against God) pollute the Temple, and the\nblood from ritually sacrificed animals is used to purify the Temple of\nthe pollution, thus also cleansing the sinner of guilt for their sin.\n\u201cGuilt\u201d here does not refer to the mental state of feeling\nguilty. It also does not mean \u201chaving performed a wrong\naction\u201d. It is supposed to be an objective status of some\nsort\u2014a kind of mark or blot (thus the language of cleansing is\nparticularly apt) one has in virtue of having committed a wrong, which\nremains until removed (Swinburne 1989: 74). Craig (2020: 232) analyzes\nit in retributive terms as a liability to punishment. It could also be\nanalyzed as a certain sort of moral debt\u2014perhaps a debt to the\nvictim to make up for the wrong act (Radzik 2009: 29ff).\n\nExpiation would be equivalent to making amends if the language of\npurification and cleansing is a metaphor aimed to pick out what one is\nmorally required to do in response to one\u2019s wrongdoing. At the\nvery least, expiation is sufficient for making amends, for if you have\nnot done what is morally required in response to having performed a\ngiven wrong action, then you still bear guilt for that action; you\nwould still bear a liability to punishment or an unfulfilled moral\ndebt. But expiation may not be necessary for making amends. For\ninstance, if the language of purification and cleansing also\nessentially picks out certain ways of resolving guilt (say, the use of\na sacrifice of some sort), then expiation would not be necessary for\nmaking amends so long as there are other ways of doing what is morally\nrequired in response to having performed a wrong action.\n1.3 Conceptual Connections\n1.3.1 Reconciliation\n\nReconciliation has a tight conceptual connection to atonement: as\ndefined above, atonement aims at reconciliation. This connection faces\nsome questions.\n\nFirst, does this connection really hold and, if so, how should\nreconciliation be understood? After all, there seem to be clear cases\nin which a person makes atonement and does not aim to reconcile the\nrelationship that was shattered by the offense.\n\nOne or both parties may not desire or find possible\nreconciliation. Suppose Jack and Jill are married and Jill has an\naffair. She decides to leave the marriage, but feels guilt and\nremorse, apologizes to Jack, and aims to be generous and fair to him\nin their divorce proceedings. Jill makes atonement, but she does not\naim at reconciling as a married couple. And Jack may be fine with\nthat. He may find that he is unable to love her again and relate to\nher in that way, but he may welcome and accept her atonement.\nThere was no relationship to begin with that can be\nreconciled. Richards (1988) describes a case in which a stranger\ndrives by and drenches you in mud. The stranger pulls over, gets out,\napologizes, and offers to cover your dry cleaning expenses. It seems\nlike the stranger is atoning for what he did, but you and the stranger\nhave no relationship to reconcile.\nReconciliation is impossible. Suppose you wronged a\nperson who subsequently died. You may make atonement by apologizing to\nthe deceased\u2019s loved ones, by aiming to be a better person, and\nby making reparation. Reconciliation appears to be a personal\nrelationship of some sort, but one cannot have such a relationship\nwith a dead person (Strabbing 2020).\nThere is no rift in the relationship to reconcile\nbecause the wrong never had an effect on the relationship. Radzik\npresents the following case: I maliciously intend to break your\nfavorite vase and indeed attempt to do so when you are not around, so\nas not to be caught in the act. I throw it to the ground, but it\nunexpectedly bounces\u2014it turns out to be made of rubber (Radzik\n2009: 86). I may atone for this action by being remorseful, replacing\nthe vase carefully, and firmly intending to deal with my anger issues.\nAnd yet, since you never found out about my offense, our relationship\nwas unaffected.\n\n\nSecond, supposing this connection holds fast, what sort of\nreconciliation must one aim toward in atoning? There appear to be at\nleast as many sorts of reconciliation as there are sorts of\nrelationships.\n\nWe can begin to answer these questions by saying more about the nature\nof reconciliation. First, \u201creconciliation\u201d is ambiguous.\nThere is a sense of the word on which to reconcile is to restore a\npast relationship (Barth 1953 [1956: 22]). But there is another sense\non which reconciliation merely removes a rift or tension that has\narisen between two people; this sense does not assume that there was a\nsubstantive past relationship between the parties (O\u2019Collins\n2007: 12). Since atonement may be offered in the latter situation,\natonement may aim at reconciliation in the latter sense.\n\nEven so, both senses presume that in removing the rift between the\nparties due to the wrongdoing, there is some sort of relationship that\nis restored (or created) after atonement has been given and received.\nWhat could that relationship be given the other cases mentioned\nabove?\n\nRadzik argues that making amends, in her sense, also aims at\nreconciliation. But since one makes amends when one does what one is\nmorally required to do in response to having wronged someone, the\nreconciliation that is aimed at must be something that we are morally\nrequired to have with people. Radzik calls this \u201cmoral\nreconciliation\u201d, a relationship \u201cwherein the parties\nregard one another and themselves as equally valuable moral\npersons\u201d (2009: 81). For this relationship to exist, \u201cthe\nvictim will have good reason to give up her resentment, fear, and\ndistrust of the wrongdoer\u201d, (where that good reason is not\nmisleading, I think we should add) and \u201cthe wrongdoer will have\nreestablished his reputation with the victim as a member of good\nstanding in the moral community\u201d (2009: 82).\n\nMoral reconciliation helps make sense of the above cases. Regarding\nthe first case, people may not desire a restoration of a substantive\npast relationship, e.g., a marriage, but people do want to be regarded\nas an equally valuable moral person. Jill\u2019s atoning acts are\naimed at moral reconciliation (at the least). In the second case the\ndriver aims at moral reconciliation even though there was no\nsubstantive prior relationship to restore. The third case is a little\ntrickier. Full moral reconciliation with the deceased seems impossible\nsince the dead can have no reasons and have no sense of the\nwrongdoer\u2019s reputation. (Assuming there is no afterlife; if\nthere is an afterlife, then full moral reconciliation could be\nachieved there.) The wrongdoer can, however, still aim at\nreconciliation by aiming at the closest approximation he can obtain to\nmoral reconciliation\u2014for instance he can (i) produce what would\nbe good reason for the victim to give up her resentment, etc. were the\nvictim alive, and (ii) do what would reestablish his reputation with\nthe victim if the victim were alive. Regarding the fourth case, the\noffense produces a moral rift even if the victim is not aware of the\nmoral rift, for the offender has in fact wronged the victim. That rift\ncan be repaired simply by the wrongdoer repenting of his action,\nsincerely recognizing the moral worth of the victim, and engaging in\nmoral reformation. Moral reconciliation will thus occur, even though\nthe victim may never be aware that there was a rift to reconcile.\n\nAtonement does not always aim merely at moral reconciliation (Radzik\n& Murphy 2015 [2021]; Thurow 2021b). Often, a wrongdoer aims to\nreconcile a more robust relationship. Unlike in the first case, Jill\nmay instead aim to atone in a way that brings about reconciliation of\nher marriage with Jack. A person who has wronged his friend may aim to\nreconcile as friends; a worker who has wronged his employer through\nnegligence, say, may aim to reconcile as a trusted\n worker.[4]\n\nWhat is done to atone for a wrongdoing will be shaped by the sort of\nreconciliation one aims at achieving. Restoring lost trust in a\nmarriage will require considerably more (and things of a different\nnature) than restoring trust in a workplace relationship. One\u2019s\natoning acts should also be responsive to the sort of wrong that was\ndone and how it negatively affected the victim. Restoring trust with a\nspouse after having an affair will be different than restoring trust\nwith a coworker after having failed to meet at an agreed time.\n\nA wrongdoer may need to morally reconcile not only with the primary\nvictim of her wrongdoing, but with others in her community, such as\nsecondary victims or interested bystanders (Radzik 2009: 135\u20138).\nSecondary victims are those who are indirectly harmed or wronged by\nthe action\u2014such as the spouse of someone who is unjustly fired\nfrom a job. Interested bystanders are those who learn about the wrong\naction and have a legitimate interest in having a positive\nrelationship with the wrongdoer\u2014such as a friend who has an\ninterest in being with a morally trustworthy person. Atoning to the\nprimary victim in a publicly visible way can help one to morally\nreconcile with others in one\u2019s community. Public apologies and\nacts of contrition have long been used for this end. During late\nantiquity in Christian Europe, penance for sin routinely included a\npublic-facing component such as penitents sitting separately in Church\nand engaging in a public ritual of penance. Famously, the Roman\nEmperor Theodosius was required by Bishop Ambrose to perform public\npenance for having ordered a massacre of citizens of Thessalonica. The\nemperor \u201claid down all the imperial insignia, bewailed his sin\nin public in the basilica and implored absolution with tears and\nlaments\u201d (Meens 2014: 22).\n1.3.2 Forgiveness\n\nForgiveness is intimately tied into atonement. It would appear that\nforgiveness is necessary for full atonement. Reconciliation of two\nparties seems to require that the one who is wronged forgive the\nwrongdoer. If the wronged does not forgive the wrongdoer, the wronged\nis still holding something against the wrongdoer for the wrong that\nwas done, and thus the two are not reconciled with regard to the\nwrong. To fully atone would be to fully remove the rift, and thus\nachieve\n reconciliation.[5]\n\nThis is about the only clear point about how forgiveness relates to\natonement. There is a common view that forgiveness is (and only should\nbe) granted after the wrongdoer has done something to make amends. But\nthis common view has been contested by others who think that we may\n(and sometimes have good reasons to) forgive even if the offender\nhasn\u2019t atoned. Which view is correct depends upon which theory\nof forgiveness is correct. (For an excellent survey of theories of\nforgiveness, see the entry on\n forgiveness.)\n\nMany defend the common view, arguing that forgiveness should (or maybe\neven conceptually must only) be done in response to the\nwrongdoer\u2019s performance of various acts that constitute at least\npartial atonement. Charles Griswold, developing an approach that has\nbeen inspired by Bishop Butler\u2019s seminal discussion of\nforgiveness and resentment, argues that x forgives y\nfor R iff\n\nx foreswears revenge against y\nfor R, and\nx appropriately moderates\nx\u2019s resentment of y due to R,\nand\nx \u201ccommits to work to a frame of\nmind in which even that resentment is let go\u201d (Griswold 2007:\n42).\n\n\nCondition (iii)\n implies that the wrongdoer must have done something to warrant the\nvictim\u2019s letting go of resentment; these things will amount to\noffering atonement. Why?\n\n\nIf moderated resentment is still warranted all things considered, then\nforgiveness is impossible or premature. Forgiveness does not attempt\nto get rid of warranted resentment. Rather, it follows from the\nrecognition that the resentment is no longer warranted. And what would\nprovide the warrant can be nothing other than the right reasons. These\nspecify the conditions the offending party should meet to qualify for\nforgiveness. (Griswold 2007: 43)\n\n\nThese conditions include atoning acts such as repentance, confession,\noffering a true narrative, and commitment to moral transformation.\nSwinburne (1989) and Wolterstorff (2011) offer different arguments for\nthe same\n position.[6]\n\nOther accounts of forgiveness imply that whether a person forgives or\nought to forgive is independent of whether the wrongdoer has made any\natonement. For example, Garrard and McNaughton say that x\nforgives y for R iff x releases (or lacks)\nill will towards y and x adopts an attitude of at\nleast minimal good will towards y (2010: 90). They argue\nthat, on this view, we can have good reason to forgive someone even if\nthey haven\u2019t repented or made any sort of\n atonement.[7]\n For we have reasons of human solidarity to forgive: wrongdoers are\nstill part of the human family and as such we have a stake in their\nbeing ushered back into the family in good standing. Forgiveness is a\nway of inviting them in, although Garrard and McNaughton are careful\nto add that forgiveness does not entail condoning, forgetting, or\nexcusing the wrongdoer for what they did. Indeed, having good will\ntowards the wrongdoer, on their view, requires having a clear view of\nwhat was wrong about the wrongdoer\u2019s action, and for their\ndegree of responsibility. A forgiver may still feel indignant and may\nstill desire that the wrongdoer be punished. In addition, because of\nour solidarity, we know that we the innocent have often made, and in\nvarious circumstances would make, moral mistakes and we would desire\nto be forgiven. Pettigrove (2012) argues in addition that forgiving\nlike this does not necessarily condone the wrong action, imply a lack\nof proper self-respect, or have generally bad consequences for the\nforgiver.\n\nStump (2018: 80\u20134) goes a step further, arguing that unilateral\nand unconditional forgiveness is morally obligatory since love is\nobligatory, love of x implies a desire for the good of\nx and a desire for union with x, and withholding\nforgiveness would work against the good of x and union with\nx. (Although see J. Rutledge 2022, Swinburne 2019, and Thurow\n& Strabbing 2020 for replies.) She adds that one can forgive\nanother person without reconciling with them because of obstacles\narising from the psychic condition of the wrongdoer or the effects of\nhis wrongdoing.\n\nBiggar (2001), after presenting an insightful survey of literature on\nforgiveness in the twentieth century, proposes a dual-component view\nthat aims to incorporate aspects of the above kinds of views. One\ncomponent, which he calls \u201cforgivingness\u201d, is a\nconstellation of attitudes towards the wrongdoer: overcoming\nresentment and vindictiveness, growth of compassion, and an intention\nto restore some kind of friendship with the offender. Forgivingness\nis, or ought to be, unconditional. The other component, which he calls\n\u201cforgiveness\u201d, is an act wherein the victim declares that\nhe will no longer view the wrongdoer in the light of his misdeed and\nthat their relationship may proceed as before. Forgiveness is\nconditional upon at least the repentance of the wrongdoer.\n\nOn each of the above views, forgiveness is conceptually distinct from\nreconciliation. However, Strabbing has recently argued for a\nconceptual tie between forgiveness and reconciliation. On her\nview,\n\n\nX\u2019s forgiving Y for W is\nX\u2019s being open to reconciliation with Y with\nrespect to W, (2020: 533)\n\n\nwhere to be open to reconciliation is to have\n\n\nattitudes and intentions towards the offender that would reconcile\nthem with respect to the offense, if the offender\u2019s attitudes\nand intentions are what they should be for reconciliation. (2020:\n 535)[8]\n\n1.3.3 Sacrifice\n\nThe notion of sacrifice is commonly associated with atonement, no\ndoubt because of the Biblical history of both notions. The book of\nLeviticus, for instance, describes various ancient Israelite ritual\nsacrifices, some of which aimed to atone (Milgrom\n 1991).[9]\n For instance, if someone (i) does not speak up to testify what he\nknows in a public case, (ii) touches anything ceremonially unclean,\n(iii) thoughtlessly takes an oath, or (iv) deceives or cheats his\nneighbor about something, that person is \u201cguilty and will be\nheld responsible\u201d (Lev 5:17, NIV). Because of this,\n\n\nas a penalty he must bring to the priest, that is, to the Lord, his\nguilt offering, a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the\nproper value. (Lev. 6:6, NIV)\n\n\nThe ram is then ritually slaughtered, its blood is wiped or sprinkled\non some parts of the altar, and some of its parts are burned.\n\n\nIn this way the priest will make atonement for him before the Lord,\nand he will be forgiven for any of these things he did that made him\nguilty. (Lev. 6:7, NIV)\n\n\nThese sorts of sacrifices can be offered by people as needed\nthroughout the year, although there was an annual ritual\u2014the Day\nof Atonement, or Yom Kippur\u2014whose purpose was to deal with all\nthe sins of the Israelites committed throughout the\n year.[10]\n\nThese symbolically rich sacrificial rituals were seen to help ancient\nIsraelites expiate and atone for their sins (Klawans 2006). Expiation\nis plainly an effect of these rituals, which are designed to respond\nto and remove the guilty status of wrongdoers. But atonement is also\nplainly a goal. The Tanakh says that God will dwell among the\nIsraelites (Exodus 29:46), but sin can drive away God\u2019s presence\nand lead God to punish the nation (Lev. 26). Proper observance of the\nsacrifices is intended to prevent this from happening\u2014thus,\nmaintaining a relationship through the tension caused by sin (Klawans\n2006).\n\nOther features of these sacrificial rituals reveal an awareness of the\nimportance of various aspects of atonement\u2014confession,\nrepentance, and intention to morally reform (Thurow 2021a). Some have\nargued that slaughter of the offering represents what was due to the\nofferer as a sinner\u2014death, as a punishment for sin (Halbertal\n2012). Some of the rituals require restitution to the human victim\n(Lev. 6:5). Thus the rituals acknowledge that sin or wrongdoing often\nhas two victims\u2014God, and a human\u2014and the wrongdoer ought\nto atone to both. Lastly, the rituals acknowledge corporate effects of\nsin and a need for corporate or collective atonement. Interestingly,\neven though in many places sin is described as a stain on the sinner,\nthe blood from the sacrifice is not applied as a symbolic detergent to\nthe sinner. Rather, it is applied to the temple. The temple is\npolluted by human sins, and continued such pollution is disastrous for\nthe nation as a whole\u2014not just to the individual sinners\nresponsible for those stains. Sin, or wrongdoing, thus has a negative\neffect on the community as a whole. The Day of Atonement rituals are\nexplicitly presented as offerings for the sin of Israel as a whole\n(Milgrom 1991; J. Rutledge 2022; Thurow 2015).\n\nEventually Jews and Christians abandoned these sacrificial rituals,\nalthough both groups maintained a connection between sacrifice and\natonement. For Christians, Jesus\u2019s death by crucifixion came to\nbe seen as the ultimate sacrifice to atone for human sin, thus\nrendering the system of animal sacrifices superfluous. (See Daly 2009\nand Moffitt 2022 for recent accounts of Christian use of the notion of\nsacrifice.) For Jews, Yom Kippur is still today the highest holy day\nand it maintains its central focus on dealing with human sin. However,\nRabbinic Judaism\u2014working with threads from the Tanakh\u2014came\nto regard various other human activities as sacrificial, expiatory,\nand atoning, such as prayer, confession, charity, and other kinds of\nvoluntarily endured suffering (Halbertal\n 2012).[11]\n\nSacrifice as described above has been seen to play a role in atoning\nfor human sin against God. But there is a sense in which atonement\nbetween humans often involves sacrifice\u2014not a sacrifice to the\nvictim, but a sacrifice for the victim. \u201cSacrifice for\u201d\nhere means, approximately, a difficult or costly loss of something one\ncares about for the sake of another individual, collective, or cause\nof value (Halbertal 2012). Many of the ways humans atone to others for\ntheir wrongs involve sacrifice in this sense. Repentance can sacrifice\nof one\u2019s sense of dignity; apologies, one\u2019s reputation;\nreparation and restitution, one\u2019s time or resources.\n1.3.4 Propitiation\n\n\u201cTo propitiate\u201d can sometimes mean simply \u201cto\nexpiate\u201d or \u201cto atone\u201d, but often the word implies\n\u201cto appease\u201d or \u201cto conciliate\u201d. In this\nlatter sense, to propitiate someone for the wrong you have done them\nis to do something to appease them, to change their attitude towards\nyou in a more positive direction. Propitiation isn\u2019t always\nrequired for atonement because, as in the\n fourth example\n in\n section 1.3.1,\n you can wrong someone without them knowing it. They have no attitudes\nabout your wrong action to change. But of course in many cases a\nvictim will be aware of having been wronged and will thus be angry,\nupset, and ill at ease with the wrongdoer. In these cases, if one is\nto atone\u2014to remove the rift that has arisen with a person due to\none\u2019s having wronged them, in order to achieve\nreconciliation\u2014one will have to propitiate one\u2019s victim to\nat least some degree. For if the victim is in the same negative state\ntowards the wrongdoer in virtue of the wrong action, then the rift\nremains and the two haven\u2019t been reconciled.\n\nThere is a fierce debate in Christian theology and Biblical\ninterpretation regarding whether Jesus\u2019s sacrifice and the\nJewish animal sacrifices should be considered propitiations of\nGod\u2019s wrath (Morris 1983; F. Rutledge\n 2015).[12]\n However, clearly in a human relationship damaged by wrongdoing, the\nvictim may feel towards the wrongdoer not only anger, but other\nnegative emotions such as resentment, condemnation, revulsion, and\nhardening of the heart. Propitiation aims to reduce or eliminate these\nsorts of emotions and replace them with other positive attitudes such\nas good will, compassion, love, trust, reapproval, benevolence,\naffection, or\n esteem.[13]\n\nSince propitiation is an appeal to the victim to change her attitude\nin a more positive direction, the wrongdoer must acknowledge that the\nsuccess of his attempt at propitiation and the fate of the\nrelationship is in the hands of the victim. The victim determines when\nto offer forgiveness and when to reduce her negative attitudes and\nreplace them with positive attitudes. (Of course, one cannot do these\nthings entirely at will.)\n\nThis feature of propitiation seems also to be a feature of atonement.\nWhether an act of atonement is adequate depends at least in part on\nthe victim\u2019s will and desires. Swinburne states,\n\n\nOne consequence of my harming you is just that it is in part up to you\nwhether my guilt is remitted\u2026. The victim has the right, within\nlimits, to judge when the wrongdoer\u2019s atonement suffices. (1989:\n87\u20138)\n\n\nHe argues that this is true because if instead one could remit\none\u2019s guilt simply by meeting some objective standard of\natonement, then one could wrong another and remove one\u2019s guilt\nat will.\n\n\nThat would not take seriously the fact that the act is an act by which\nyou are wronged, and in the wiping out of which you ought therefore to\nhave a say. (1989: 87)\n\n\nRadzik agrees and adds that given in atonement we aim to show and\nrestore proper respect to the victim,\n\n\nan important way for the atoning wrongdoer to reestablish respect for\nthe victim \u2026 is to give the victim a say in what comes next.\n(2009: 123)\n\n\nBoth agree, however, that there are moral limits to what a victim can\ndemand for\n atonement.[14]\n1.3.5 Satisfaction\n\nTo offer satisfaction, in the sense that has been connected to\natonement since at least the time of the writing of the later books in\nthe Hebrew scriptures, is to pay a debt (Anderson 2009: 44ff).\nEconomic metaphors for atoning and making amends have flourished ever\nsince; evidence of them is seen in various second Temple Jewish texts\nand early Christian texts, up through the medieval discussions of\nsatisfaction (Anderson 2009; Burns 1975). Forgiveness is also\nsometimes understood in terms of canceling a debt (Pettigrove 2012:\n21ff). How seriously to take the economic metaphor is debated, but\nbroad notions of satisfaction and moral debt can be outlined that stay\nneutral about the aptness of economic metaphors.\n\nWhen a person wrongs another person, the wrongdoer incurs a moral debt\nthat is owed to the victim. So long as the moral debt remains\nunfulfilled, the wrongdoer remains in a state of guilt. This moral\ndebt is distinct from others, such as a debt of gratitude.\nThere\u2019s nothing intrinsically bad about having the latter debt,\nbut there is with the former, which are sometimes said to carry with\nthem a sort of moral mark or stain (Swinburne 1989).\n\nWhat sort of debt is accrued through wrongdoing? There are various\nways of describing this debt, which may produce different concrete\nviews about what one can or should do to pay the debt. Here are two:\nan obligation to make up for the wrong act (Radzik 2009: 29ff) by\nerasing as far as possible the wrong and its effects; an obligation to\ncounter the disrespect shown to the victim. However the debt is\ncharacterized, it has been thought to entail at least the following:\nwithdrawing the insult to the victim and repairing the injury done to\nthe victim and the community (Burns 1975; J. Murphy 2012a).\n\nOne way of defining \u201csatisfaction\u201d is as follows: to offer\nsatisfaction for wrong W is to fulfill one\u2019s moral debt\nof wrongdoing for W. On this definition, satisfaction is\nequivalent to making amends since by fulfilling one\u2019s moral debt\nfor W, one does whatever is morally required to respond to\nhaving done W. Although this definition certainly falls\nwithin the lexical range of the term, the term is often used to\nindicate a narrower range of things one might due to make amends or\natone for wrongdoing, such as reparation, restitution, compensation,\nor penance. The primary aim of satisfaction, on this narrower\ndefinition, is to repair the injury and its harmful effects, although\nof course by doing so one may also contribute towards withdrawing the\ninsult of the wrong.\n2. How to Atone\n\nWe have some fairly strong intuitions about what kinds of actions can\natone and many of our stories about atonement illustrate the means\nwhich will be described in this section (McEwan 2001; Stevenson 2015).\nBut with the definitions above we can go a step further than mere\nintuition, for we can explain why these various activities atone: they\ncontribute to reconciliation and help fulfill our moral debts by\nmaking amends\u2014including the debts to withdraw insult to the\nvictim, and to repair insofar as possible the harms of the wrong to\nthe victim and to society.\n\nStump (1988) notes that when we atone we aim to deal with two\nproblems: the problem of past sin and the problem of future sin. The\nformer just is the moral wrong that was done, its harmful effects and\nthe relational rifts due to these. The latter is the problem of the\nfuture wrong that the wrongdoer remains likely to do. The latter is\nkey to atoning because reconciliation is difficult if the victim fears\nthat the wrongdoer will wrong her again in the same sort of way as\nbefore. Furthermore, if part of a wrongdoer\u2019s moral duty is to\nrepair the harms due to the wrong, then the wrongdoer may be required\nto assuage fear and trepidation about potential future violations.\n2.1 Apology\n\nAlthough there is some dispute concerning how best to define the\nnotion of apology (N. Smith 2008), many apologies plainly help atone\nfor wrongdoing. Smith presents the notion of a categorical apology,\nwhich he takes to be a regulative ideal (N. Smith 2008; 2014).\nCategorical apologies involve some thirteen features such as accepting\nblame, recognizing the victim as a moral interlocutor, and reforming\none\u2019s\n behavior.[15]\n All thirteen features of categorical apology plainly can atone, as\nthey each can help bridge the rift preventing reconciliation, as well\nas help fulfill moral debts of wrongdoing. Indeed, categorical apology\nis defined to include almost everything that could go into atoning for\na wrong\u2014for Smith, repentance, reparation, accepting punishment,\nand moral reformation all count as part of apology. But Smith\nacknowledges that most of our apologies do not include all thirteen\nfeatures.\n\nHow we define apology ultimately is of little significance to the\nissue of how we can atone. Actions can be carved and catalogued as one\npleases, so long as the actions of atoning significance are included\nsomewhere in the catalogue. In this section I will work with the\nnarrower notion of a genuine apology: one genuinely apologizes for an\naction when one accepts blame for the action, has the standing to\naccept blame for it, feels sorrow and guilt, regards the victim as a\nmoral interlocutor, communicates the apology to the victim, and\nintends to reform and offer redress. This narrower notion is fairly\nwell expressed, surprisingly enough, on a sign often found in Jimmy\nJohn\u2019s sandwich shops: \u201cproper apologies have three parts:\n1. What I did was wrong. 2. I feel badly that I hurt you. 3. How can I\nmake this better?\u201d\n\nBy apologizing, the wrongdoer withdraws the insult made to the victim.\nTheir intention to refrain from the wrong action in the future gives\nthe victim at least some reason to trust them. Both aspects of apology\ncan thus reduce the rift that divides the wrongdoer from the victim\nand bring about reconciliation\u2014at least, moral reconciliation.\nIn addition, the wrongdoer\u2019s feeling of guilt and fear of\nrejection can be a source of relational rift with the victim. The\nwrongdoer can\u2019t bring themselves to face the victim. By\napologizing the wrongdoer breaks down this barrier to reconciliation\nas well (Griffiths 2021: 103).\n\nAlthough apologies may sometimes in themselves suffice to atone and\nbring about reconciliation\u2014when the offense is small, or when\nthe victim already has good reason to think that the wrongdoer is\nrepentant and that the wrongdoer wants what is best for the\nvictim\u2014often more is required to atone. Apologies can be easy to\nfake, and there are a variety of locutions that sound like apologies\nbut in fact are not\u2014e.g., expressions of sympathy, and ambiguous\napologies (N. Smith 2008: 145\u20138). Victims will thus reasonably\nbe expected to accept an apology only where there are clear signs that\nthe apology is genuine, such as if the apology is costly (Ohtsubo\n& Watanabe 2009). This is especially so if the wrongdoer aims to\nreconcile a thicker relationship with the victim, such as a close\nfriendship or a\n marriage.[16]\n\nApology isn\u2019t always necessary for atonement, such as in\nRadzik\u2019s rubber vase case and Bovens\u2019s case of a doctor\nwho secretly gives his patient a treatment intending to kill the\npatient, but by chance the treatment instead cures the patient\u2019s\ndisease (Bovens 2008). If the victim is unaware of the wrongdoing and\napologizing would only bring grief to the victim and a rupture in the\nrelationship between the offender and victim, and no other benefits,\nthen even if there is a pro tanto moral reason to apologize,\nthat reason is overridden by a moral reason not to inflict harm when\nthere are no benefits to doing so. One can atone in other ways in\nthese circumstances.\n2.2 Repentance\n\nOne repents of a wrong action when one\n\nadmits that one performed the action in question,\nadmits that the action was wrong,\nadmits that one bears at least some blame for having performed the\naction, and\nresolves to amend one\u2019s ways (Swinburne 1989: 82).\n\n\nThe resolution to amend one\u2019s ways includes a resolution to make\namends to the victim, and a resolution to not perform similar actions\nin the future. The latter resolution may require one to repudiate and\nseek to change aspects of one\u2019s character (J. Murphy 2003). The\nGreek word that translates as \u201crepentance\u201d is\n\u201cmetanoia\u201d, which means to make a fundamental change of\none\u2019s mind or outlook. A repentant person changes her outlook\nabout her past actions for the right reason; you\u2019re not\nrepentant if you decide to amend your ways not because you care at all\nabout being blameworthy for having done something wrong, but because\nyou don\u2019t want to be caught, or you don\u2019t want to be\nthought of poorly. One repents when one resolves to amend one\u2019s\nways because of how one has blameworthily wronged another person.\n\nThere is also an emotional component to repentance. Someone who is\nrepentant has remorse and guilt about her wrong action (J. Murphy\n2012b). She also experiences sympathy towards her victim (Bovens\n2008), sadness at having acted wrongly, and\n contrition.[17]\n\nRepentance contributes to atonement in various ways. It is a necessary\ningredient of a genuine apology. Repentance is a prerequisite for\nmoral and thicker sorts of reconciliation. Moral reconciliation\ninvolves entering into a relationship of mutual moral respect and it\nseems that a wrongdoer does not respect a victim by refraining from\nrepenting. The wrongdoer has an obligation to fix what can be fixed\nabout the wrong action and its effects; one thing that can be fixed is\nthe insult to the victim. By repenting, the wrongdoer begins to\nwithdraw the insult.\n\nMany theological approaches to repentance share the above features,\nbut regard repentance as a more general rejection of sin and embrace\nof God\u2019s goodness. For example, repentance in both Roman\nCatholic Christianity and Sufi Islam requires\n (i)\u2014(iv)\n above together with emotions of contrition, regret, and sadness\ntowards sin. Both, however, also regard repentance as interior\nconversion: rejecting living in sin and embracing a new way of life\nfollowing God (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1431 [2.2.2.4.IV,\n Other Internet Resources];\n Khalil 2018).\n2.3 Giving a True Account\n\nTo give a true account of a wrong is to accurately describe what\nhappened and to explain the motivations, intents, desires, passions,\nand thinking behind the wrong action. Ideally, the wrongdoer would\ncome to understand a true and relatively complete account of their\nwrongdoing and communicate that understanding to the victim, who would\nthen incorporate it into their own understanding of the event. In this\nideal situation, the understanding and exchange of a true account of\nthe wrongdoing helps bring about reconciliation. First, for the\noffender to repent and genuinely apologize, he needs to be aware of\nthe extent of his culpability for the wrong action and this awareness\nrequires something approaching a true account of his\n action.[18]\n For similar reasons, an offender\u2019s awareness of a true account\nof their wrongdoing assists in personal moral reformation and\ntransformation, which can also atone.\n\nSecond, victims can experience a variety of negative consequences that\nresult due in part to a lack of awareness of a true account of the\nwrongdoing (Volf 2006). Victims are often confused about why someone\nwould wrong them in the way they did. This confusion can be\nintrinsically painful. Worse, victims often feel that they are in some\nway to blame for the event, or feel shame at having been victimized.\nLacking a true account of what happened, victims can also feel greater\nfear of being victimized again without any good idea of how to prevent\nit from happening. Receiving a true account of the wrong action from\nthe offender can help heal these negative consequences. \u201cIt\ntakes knowing the truth to be set free from the psychic injury caused\nby wrongdoing\u201d (Volf 2006: 75).\n\nThird, it is difficult enough to know why we ourselves do what we do,\nbut even more difficult to know why someone else does what they do.\nAnd when we have been victimized, it can be immensely tempting to\nreconstruct an account of what happened that demonizes the offender.\nWe can hold offenders more culpable than they deserve. We can fail to\nsympathize with their personal weaknesses and circumstances which have\nled them to form poor adaptational strategies (M. Adams 1991), and\nwith common human frailties we share (Garrard & McNaughton 2010).\nVictims can thus, understandably and often nonculpably, form views of\nthe offender that erect a barrier to reconciliation. By giving a true\naccount, wrongdoers can help break down this barrier to\nreconciliation, thus atoning for their wrongdoing.\n2.4 Moral Reformation and Transformation\n\nAs noted above, repentance entails a resolution to amend one\u2019s\nways regarding the wrong action in view. This implies more than just\nresolving to never again do that kind of wrong action to that person\nin those kinds of circumstances. One must resolve against performing\nwrong actions of a more general sort. My resolving not to lie to you\nabout using our money to make spontaneous personal purchases is not\nenough. I must resolve not to lie about how I use money more\ngenerally, and I must resolve not to lie to anyone (or maybe anyone\nwho has a significant interest in knowing about my money usage). To\ncarry out this resolution, I must also examine why I am inclined to\nlie about how I use money and then begin to transform my motivations\nand how I respond to them. And I must do all of this not just because\nI do not want to be caught, or to get you off my case, but because I\nsee how lying about how I use money wrongs you and others. In short,\nrepentance requires that I resolve to be morally reformed or\ntransformed.\n\nSince a resolution to reform (as I shall here abbreviate it) is a part\nof repentance and repentance atones, resolutions to reform contribute\nto atonement. But both the resolution to reform and the reform itself\nalso atone separate from being a necessary ingredient of repentance.\nReform regarding the wrong action in view constitutes moral respect\nfor the victim. It demonstrates that the wrongdoer has taken seriously\nhis wronging of the victim and repudiates that wronging by\ntransforming his life so that he will not (or he is less likely to)\nwrong the victim or others in this sort of way again. Reform also, for\nsimilar reasons, can serve to withdraw the insult of the victim.\nReform also enables reconciliation. Part of what blocks reconciliation\nis the victim\u2019s fear of being wronged again. Since reform atones\nin these ways, and resolving to reform puts one on the path to reform\n(and can itself partially withdraw insult and reduce fear of future\nwrong), resolving to reform also atones.\n\nExperience shows that moral reformation and transformation often\nrequires struggle and time, and we often fall short of the change we\ndesire. Perhaps in part for this reason, in many cases we seem not to\nrequire moral transformation in order to reconcile with someone who\nhas wronged us. When the harm isn\u2019t very great, when the threat\nof future harm from the wrongdoer isn\u2019t very great (or when we\ncan easily be more vigilant to prevent or avoid the harm), and when we\nknow that ordinary human limitations and temptations explain the\nwrong, in practice we seem content to reconcile even if the wrongdoer\nhasn\u2019t morally reformed and even may be unlikely to reform.\nGenuine repentance displayed to us is often sufficient. Coming to\nrepent can itself be a difficult journey for many people; sometimes it\nmay be the best we can hope for from a wrongdoer, and sufficient to\nreconcile some sort of relationship.\n2.5 Reparation/Restitution/Recompense/Satisfaction\n\nAs noted in\n section 1.3.5,\n wrongdoers accrue a moral debt to their victim to, at the least,\nwithdraw the insult conveyed by, and repair the harmful effects of,\ntheir wrong. Sometimes the harm is so minor\u2014such as the harm\nresulting from forgetting to keep one\u2019s promise to one\u2019s\nspouse to pick up milk at the store\u2014that no reparation is\nrequired beyond repentance and an apology. But, often and tragically,\nwrong actions result in substantial harms. In those cases, it seems\nthat atonement and making amends require that wrongdoers fulfill their\nmoral debts to repair the harm.\n\nThe terms \u201creparation\u201d, \u201crestitution\u201d,\n\u201crecompense\u201d, and \u201csatisfaction\u201d all have\nslightly different shades of meaning (Spelman 2002). Satisfaction, as\ndefined above, is the most general term; \u201creparation\u201d in\neveryday speech is quite close in meaning. Recompense and restitution\nare more specific ways of repairing through monetary compensation or\nan exchange of equivalent value to the\n harm.[19]\n\nAlthough there are different shades of meaning to the four notions,\nthey are unified by sharing a goal that each aims to achieve: undoing\nthe harmful effects of the wrong (Zolkos\n 2020).[20]\n Harms cannot literally be completely undone, even in cases of minor\nwrongs and harms. I may replace your window I have carelessly broken\nwith a new window, but there still was a time when your window was\nbroken during which you were angry and resentful. Those latter events\ncannot be undone. Reparation, restitution, etc. aim at approximating\nan undoing of the harmful effects.\n2.6 Penance\n\nThe word \u201cpenance\u201d is most familiar today from the Roman\nCatholic sacrament of penance. Used to refer to the sacrament in its\nentirety, it refers to a process involving contrition for sin,\nconfession, satisfaction, and absolution. The word is often used more\nnarrowly to describe the third step of that process, satisfaction\n(Barton 1961). However, although penance in this narrower sense may\nsometimes include the sorts of things that are described in\n section 2.5,\n those things are done with a different purpose qua\npenance.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, penance\u2014the sacrament\u2014is a sort of\nmedicine for the soul (John Paul II 1984: 31). Each part of the\nsacrament is medicinal, including satisfaction\u2014or penance,\nnarrowly construed (Aquinas ST supp 12.3). Penance, in the\nnarrow sense, in part can involve reparation since making reparation\nis part of how we make amends and atone, and thus remove guilt for our\nsin. But penance is also medicinal in another way: it is supposed to\nexpress a desire for and help bring about moral and spiritual\ntransformation. Consequently, many penances \u2013such as saying\ncertain prayers, or reading certain spiritual texts, or giving\nalms\u2014do not offer reparation to the human victim of one\u2019s\nsin (they may amount to reparation to God). Penance, in the narrower\nsense, thus denotes a certain class of acts that express a desire for\nand aid in bringing about what was discussed in\n section 2.4\u2014moral\n transformation\u2014as well as spiritual transformation.\n\nPenance, in the narrower sense, can thus also have a secular meaning\nif the notion is narrowed even further: x does penance for\nwrong R if and only if x does something to express a\ndesire for and to help produce moral transformation in response to\nhaving done R. Criminals may in this sense do penance for\ntheir crimes by, say, doing community service or by committing\nthemselves to helping other people to avoid committing similar sorts\nof crimes.\n\nRichard Swinburne proposes a different secular notion of penance:\npenance is something a wrongdoer provides to his victim that (i) is\noffered in addition to reparation or compensation, and (ii) is offered\nas a way of disowning the wrong action by indicating his appreciation\nfor the victim, his awareness of the seriousness of the wrong, and his\nsorrow at having wronged the victim (Swinburne 1989: 83\u201384).\nPenance, in this sense, is significant as a performative act of\ndisowning. Apologies can be insincere or routine, and reparation can\nbe done without a spirit of contrition and sorrow. Penance, in\nSwinburne\u2019s sense, helps the wrongdoer to adequately communicate\nto his victim contrition, sorrow, and appreciation.\n2.7 Punishment\n\nThe relationship between punishment and atonement has been highly\ndisputed. Part of the dispute results from divergent understandings of\npunishment. For instance, Anselm says that justice requires that\nhumans who sin against God must either repay the honor they have taken\nfrom God (i.e., offer satisfaction), or suffer punishment (Anselm\nCur Deus Homo, CDH hereafter, 13). But punishment,\nin this case, would result in eternal damnation and God doesn\u2019t\nwant that end for his creatures. Satisfaction thus provides a way for\natonement, but punishment does not. Aquinas, however, seems to think\nthat sin must be atoned through penal compensation and acts of penance\nand reparation count as penal because they are imposed for sin and are\ninvoluntary in themselves, although people voluntarily accept them in\nthe circumstances when they desire to atone (see ST\nI-II.87.6). Satisfactions are thus punishments, on this view, and thus\nat least some punishments atone.\n\nAccording to contemporary western views of punishment, for an act to\ncount as punishment it must\n\nimpose some cost or hardship (which could amount to the loss of an\nopportunity or privilege),\nbe done intentionally by the punisher,\nbe imposed in response to what is believed to be a wrong act,\nbe imposed as a way of expressing condemnation or censure of the\nact, and\nbe performed by a recognized authority (see the entry on\n punishment).\n\n\nIn this sense, most acts of penance and reparation\u2014unless\nimposed by a recognized authority\u2014will not amount to punishment.\nTypical punishments, on this notion, include: fines, prison sentences,\nthe death penalty, court ordered community service, and time-outs\ndeclared by parents.\n\nCan punishments, understood in this sense, atone? Once again,\npunishments that are impositions of reparation, penance, and apology\ncan atone, for all the same reasons that they can atone when done on\ntheir own, independently of being imposed as punishment. However,\nthese actions appear to have less value as acts of atonement when\nundertaken merely as punishment than when undertaken voluntarily from\nthe\n heart.[21]\n When an action is undertaken merely as punishment, it does not (or\ndoes not clearly convey) any repentance, contrition, or\nremorse\u2014unlike (typically) when it is undertaken voluntarily\nindependent of an imposition of punishment. Thus, an essential\ningredient of atonement for moral reconciliation is absent in the\nformer case. Even worse, acts undertaken merely as punishment can\nhinder atonement by producing resentment, anger, and other attitudes\nthat hinder\n reconciliation.[22]\n\nWhat about punishments such as jail time, the death penalty, and other\nforms of enforced suffering such as lashings\u2014can these\npunishments atone? Rashdall (1907; 1920) and others have argued that\nthese practices, typically justified on retributive grounds, do not\natone as they do no good to the wrongdoer or the victim (aside from\nprotection from future harm), and do nothing to bring about any sort\nof reconciliation between the wrongdoer and victim. Indeed, for the\nreasons mentioned above, punishment can hinder reconciliation.\n\nDefenders of certain retributivist theories of punishment, such as\nwhat Craig (2020: 178) calls positive retributivism, can resist\nRashdall\u2019s argument as follows: wrongdoers morally should be\npunished, and so to make amends they must be punished, and since\natoning requires making amends, being punished atones. This view faces\na challenge: how can punishment be a way of atoning if punishment\ndoesn\u2019t even aim at reconciliation? How does the wrongdoer being\nimprisoned (for example) aim for any sort of reconciliation between\nthe wrongdoer and the victim?\n\nGarvey (1999), drawing on expressivist theories of punishment, offers\none answer to this question. A wrong action both harms and wrongs the\nvictim.\n\n\nThe harm of a crime is the material loss it causes\u2026the wrong of\na crime is the message of disrespect or dishonor it conveys. (Garvey\n1999: 1821)\n\n\nPunishment is our conventional means to, as a society, counter this\nmessage. The counter-message of punishment can thus bring about moral\nreconciliation by removing or repudiating the insult delivered by the\nwrong action. Moral reconciliation between the victim and wrongdoer\nrequires more than that society send a counter-message; it\nrequires that the wrongdoer send the counter-message. By\nvoluntarily submitting to just punishment, the wrongdoer makes the\npublic message sent by punishment his\n own.[23]\n\nThis defense of the atoning value of punishment, however, seems to\nimply that punishment is not absolutely necessary for making atonement\nsince there are many other ways a wrongdoer could clearly communicate\na repudiation of the insult delivered by their wrong action. Indeed,\napology, reparation, and acts of moral improvement can\u2014perhaps\neven more clearly\u2014communicate a repudiation of the insult\n(Radzik 2009: 44). However, in some cases it may be conditionally\nnecessary to be punished in order to atone\u2014for instance, if\nthere is a clearly established set of punishments that are taken to be\nthe way people should express repudiation of their wrong actions. In\nthese cases, refraining from accepting a just punishment due to you\nwould communicate a lack of repudiation.\n2.8 Third Party Assistance\n\nThe wrongdoer will have to do at least some of the atoning work.\nAtonement aims at moral reconciliation at the very least, which\nrequires a renewed respect for the victim from the wrongdoer. This\nrenewed respect requires at least repentance and perhaps make some\nefforts at moral transformation. However, it seems that people other\nthan the wrongdoer can assist with atonement. Indeed, according to\nChristianity, Christ has made atonement for all human sin even though\nChrist himself is completely innocent of sin.\n\nThere is a difference between helping another person to atone, and\natoning for another person. The former is plainly possible. A\nwrongdoer\u2019s friend could help them to atone by, for example,\nencouraging them to repent, helping them construct a true account of\nthe wrong action, discussing with them ways to apologize, driving them\nto a meeting with the victim so that the wrongdoer can apologize. The\nlatter also seems possible. Indeed, an entire religious\ntradition\u2014Christianity\u2014is predicated on its possibility.\nAquinas, following similar statements by Anselm, writes,\n\n\nsince those who differ as to the debt of punishment may be one in will\nby the union of love, it happens that one who has not sinned bears\nwillingly the punishment for another, just as even in human affairs we\nsee men take the debts of another upon themselves. (ST\nI-II.87.7)\n\n\nThe sort of punishment that others can bear for us is what he calls\n\u201csatisfactory punishment\u201d, which amounts to what we above\ncalled reparation imposed as punishment. Thus, a wrongdoer\u2019s\nfriend could pay a fine, or replace a damaged or lost item, or perform\nsome other act of service that is owed to the victim.\n\nCan third parties atone for a wrongdoer by acting as a substitute for\npunishment in the narrower sense described in\n section 2.7?\n D. Lewis (1997) argues that we are of two minds about penal\nsubstitution. He observes, following a long line of thinkers\nstretching back at least to Socinus in the sixteenth century CE, that\nwe do not allow penal substitution amongst humans for punishments such\nas imprisonment, the death penalty, and lashings. If someone were to\noffer themselves in place of their brother, say, on the electric\nchair, \u201cthe offer would strike the authorities as senseless, and\nthey would decline it out of hand\u201d (D. Lewis 1997: 129).\nHowever, Lewis also observes that we are of two minds because we also\nseem to have no problem with third parties paying penal fines on\nbehalf of wrongdoers.\n\nM. Murphy (2009) and Quinn (2004) observe that we are sometimes\nuncomfortable with penal fines being paid by a third party. Murphy\nargues, further\u2014assuming an expressivist view of\npunishment\u2014that penal substitution is incoherent because the\nputative punishment undergone by the third party does not express any\ncondemnation of the third party. However, he thinks that vicarious\npunishment is possible and can be justly performed. Vicarious\npunishment occurs when\n\n\nA deserves to be punished; B undergoes hard treatment, which hard\ntreatment constitutes A\u2019s being punished; and so A no longer\ndeserves to be punished. (M. Murphy 2009: 260)\n\n\nHill and Jedwab (2015) object that Murphy begs the question by\nassuming that the recipient of punishment must be the object of\ncondemnation. They suggest there are cases where this seems false,\nsuch as when a teacher punishes everyone in a class for the actions of\na few students, or when a sergeant imposes suffering on all the\nsoldiers in a squad because of the actions of just a few members.\nThurow (2015) agrees that these can be cases of penal substitution,\nbut he explains how penal substitution is conceptually and morally\npossible by understanding the third party as acting for a collective\nentity of which they are a member, where the collective is guilty of\nwrongdoing.\n\nCraig (2020) rejects Murphy\u2019s argument on the grounds that there\nare cases of punishment that do not express condemnation, e.g.,\npunishment for crimes of strict liability such as marijuana\npossession. (See\n section 4.3\n for further discussion of penal substitution.)\n3. Human\u2013Divine Atonement\n\nAtonement is deeply important for religions such as Judaism and,\nespecially, Christianity. (See Cornille 2021 for a comparison of these\nwith other religious approaches to atonement.) In this and the\nfollowing sections we will focus on the Christian notion of God and\nwhat atonement might look like in a Christian context.\n\nJust as humans can wrong each other, so can they wrong\n God.[24]\n Atoning to God can differ from atoning to a fellow human because the\nvictim, the nature of the wrongdoing, and the kind of relationship\nthat one aims to or should aim to reconcile all differ. First,\nGod\u2019s nature may affect the seriousness of wrongs against him.\nAnselm and many others in the medieval Christian theological\ntradition, for instance, hold that sinning against God is infinitely\nworse than wronging a fellow human being because God is perfectly,\ninfinitely good whereas fellow humans are not (CDH II.14; see\nalso Aquinas ST I-II.87.3\u20134).\n\nSecond, how God is wronged differs in some ways from how humans are\nwronged. Wronging God disrespects and insults him and wronging someone\nis always \u201cin itself objectively harmful\u201d (Cross 2001:\n401). However, God is harmed by sin differently than humans are harmed\nby wrongdoing. God\u2019s safety or existence is never threatened.\nGod cannot be physically or emotionally injured in his divine\n nature.[25]\n But God can be harmed in other ways: his desire that humans love and\nobey him can be frustrated, his plans for humanity can be frustrated\n(Anselm CDH I.23), and he is indirectly harmed by the harm\ndone to other things he loves (Hick 1993 [2005:\n 123]).[26]\n The latter harm implies that atoning to God will require atoning to\nthe human victims of one\u2019s wrongdoing (Thurow\n 2017a).[27]\n\nThird, the shape of atonement to God for human sin depends on the kind\nof reconciled relationship humans want or should want to have with\nGod, or that God wants to have with them\u2014especially important\nif, as Christians believe, God plays a crucial role in helping humans\natone (Thurow\n 2021b).[28]\n This relationship has been depicted many different ways: as a certain\nsort of union of love (John 17:20ff; Stump 2018), a familial\nrelationship\u2014being brothers and sisters of Christ, with God as\nfather (Hebrews 2:10ff), friendship with God (John 15:12ff; Aquinas\nST II-II.23.1), fellowship with God (1Cor. 1:9; Taylor 1941),\ncovenantal love (Deut. 7:9\u201310; Levenson 2016), all followers of\nGod being unified in one body, with Christ as the head (Ephesians\n4:1ff; De Lubac 1947 [1988]), and deification/theosis/renewing the\nimage of God in humanity (2Cor. 3:18; Athanasius On the\nIncarnation). These are each more robust relationships than\nmerely moral reconciliation.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there are several different accounts of how humans can\nand should atone to God for human sin. In the next two sections we\nwill survey several different theories of the Christian doctrine of\natonement. Each theory tends to emphasize one or more of the ways of\natonement described in\n section 2\n in their accounts of how Christ atones for human sin. Thus the\ntheories implicitly grant that atoning to God resembles to some degree\natoning to humans\u2014although the nature of God, the severity of\nhuman sin, the weakness of humans, and other contextual factors are\ntaken to imply that atoning to God will in practice and detail look\ndifferent than atoning to humans (Thurow 2021a).\n\nFor a summary of work on the issue of how the Christian doctrine of\natonement might help make sense of moral phenomena, see the appendix,\nAtonement, God, and Morality (LINK).\n4. Classical Theories of the Doctrine of Atonement\n\nAlthough the doctrine of the atonement is central to Christianity,\nthere has been no widely accepted account of how Christ atones for\nhuman sin. The Nicene Creed\u2014an ecumenical creed declared at the\nCouncil of Nicea in 325 CE\u2014asserts that\n\n\nJesus Christ\u2026for our salvation came down and became flesh, and\nwas made man, suffered, and rose again on the third day. (Denzinger\n2012: 51)\n\n\nThis brief statement asserts that Christ atones for human sin, but\nneither Nicea nor any other ecumenical creed has given an account of\nhow Christ atones for human\n sin.[29]\n\nEvery Christian wants their view of atonement to do justice to the\nChristian scriptures, but doing so is challenging. The New Testament\nuses a diverse array of language to describe Christ\u2019s atonement;\nweaving this language into a coherent account presents one challenge\n(Letham 1993; Grensted 1920; O\u2019Collins 2007). Another challenge\ncomes from the Jewish background. The New Testament says that Christ\nboth fulfills God\u2019s law in the Old Testament and is a sacrifice\nthat deals once and for all with the problem of human sin. But there\nis dispute over how to understand both these Old Testament notions and\nhow the New Testament is using them (Finlan 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nPhilosophical assumptions present another challenge to developing an\naccount of the doctrine of atonement. The notions of God\u2019s love,\njustice, and forgiveness play a key role in understanding atonement.\nAlthough scriptural interpretation helps to interpret those notions,\ntheologians also bring their own philosophical assumptions about these\nnotions to their accounts. Intuitions about love and justice, for\nexample, have both motivated some theories, and provided material for\nchallenging other theories.\n\nIn this section we briefly survey some of the most prominent\nhistorical accounts of the doctrine of the atonement. Various schemes\nhave been used to categorize accounts. Aul\u00e9n (1930 [1931])\nfamously divides them into three categories: Christus Victor,\nforensic, and subjective or exemplarist. Others distinguish between\nobjective and subjective theories, or God-ward and man-ward theories\n(MacKinnon 1966; Grensted 1920; Fiddes 1989; Thurow 2021a). Another\nway to categorize accounts would be according to which of the ways of\natoning (see\n section 2\n above) are emphasized in the explanation of what Christ does to atone\nfor human sin.\n\nThese theories share some common assumptions. First, without\nChrist\u2019s atoning work, humans could not be saved from their\nstate of sin (1Cor. 15: 3\u20134, 17). Second, there is an\nanti-Pelagian assumption: humans can do nothing of their own power to\nmerit salvation, and thus they can do nothing of their own power to\natone for sin (O\u2019Collins 2007: 64ff). Third, although Christ\natones for human sin, to take advantage of Christ\u2019s atoning\nwork, humans must themselves repent of their sins (1John\n1:7\u20132:2). Thus, humans contribute something to atonement for\ntheir sins, although even here God\u2019s grace is needed for humans\nto fully repent. Fourth, atonement for human sin must either involve\nor entail, in normal circumstances, that humans who have accepted the\natoning work of Christ will be morally transformed. As Turner puts\nit,\n\n\neven the most rigidly objective doctrine of the Cross must leave room\nfor the Imitatio Christi [i.e., that humans should imitate\nChrist] at least as a corollary or a consequent. (1952 [2004:\n117])\n\n\nFifth, although aspects of many different parts of Christ\u2019s life\nmay atone, his death on the cross plays an important and distinctive\nrole in atonement (Pelikan 1978: 131ff; Thurow 2021a). Some of these\nassumptions function more like norms or desiderata; indeed, some\naccounts are criticized on the ground that they do not adequately\nrespect these norms.\n\nFor other useful recent surveys of accounts of the Christian doctrine\nof atonement, see Beilby & Eddy 2006; Crisp 2020a; J. Johnson\n2016; Pugh 2014; Schmiechen 2005. Grensted 1920 is a classic history\nof the doctrine\u2014readable and still useful. F. Rutledge 2015\ncontains a deep, but accessible discussion of many of the elements of\naccounts of atonement. These surveys touch on classic theories we are\nunable to discuss here such as Grotius\u2019s governmental theory and\nCampbell\u2019s vicarious penitence\n theory.[30]\n4.1 The Ransom Theory\n\nThe ransom theory was widespread in the first few centuries of\n Christianity.[31]\n Versions of it can be found in the Latin (Augustine, On the\nTrinity, books IV and XIII), Greek (Gregory of Nyssa, An\nAddress on Religious Instruction), and Syriac (Narsai,\n\u201cHomily for the Great Sunday of the Resurrection\u201d) Church\nfathers. It is an instance of a broader family of views: Christus\nVictor. Gregory Boyd, a defender of a Christus Victor account, says\nthat the \u201cessence\u201d of the view is that God breaks\n\n\ninto human history to destroy the power of sin and rescu[e] us from\nthe cosmic powers that keep us in bondage to sin. (2006: 29)\n\n\nViews differ over how to depict the cosmic powers, the nature of human\nbondage to them, and the mechanism by which God frees humans from\nbondage through the work of Christ. The ransom account fills in these\ndetails in a distinctive and memorable way, although today it is\nrarely defended (for a notable exception, see Lombardo 2013).\n\nThe ransom view is built on a drama between God, Satan and humans.\nHumans sin, and as a result fall under the power of Satan, who in his\nrole as accuser rightly subjects humans to death. God, in his love,\ndoes not desire humans to endure eternal death, but it would be unjust\nfor God to simply remove us from Satan\u2019s power as he rightly\ncondemns us to death. To solve this problem, God sends\nChrist\u2014the son of God, the second person of the\nTrinity\u2014who has both a human and divine nature. Christ is not\nguilty of sin, but Satan brings about his death anyway, which then\nfunctions as a ransom: Satan owes God for this injustice and God, in\nreturn, frees humans from Satan\u2019s\n power.[32]\n\nStated as baldly as this, the ransom theory faces several objections.\nFirst, Anselm objects that God has the right and power to simply\nremove humans from Satan\u2019s power; it would be better to do that\nthan to send God the Son to die unjustly (CDH I.6). Second,\nAnselm argues that Satan has no right to treat humans as he does. All\nare subject to God\u2019s authority and Satan would not be wronged if\nGod removed humans from his influence (CDH I.7). However, it\nshould be noted that there are ransom accounts that do not assume that\nSatan has rights over humans\u2014for instance, Irenaeus holds that\nGod submits to what Satan desires not because Satan has a right to a\nransom, but because it is more fitting for God to act through\npersuasion than force (AH V.1.1).\n\nThird, the ransom theory treats humans like mostly innocent and\nhapless beings who have been tricked and enslaved by a foreign power\n(Ray 1998). Although this idea is present in the New Testament, it\nisn\u2019t clearly connected to atonement, which concerns a torn\nrelationship due to\n sin.[33]\n\nThe ransom theory isn\u2019t typically stated so baldly, however.\nOther motifs are used in concert with the notion of ransom, and some\nof these motifs can help address some of the above objections\n(although the motifs each raise their own problems as well). In the\nnext section we survey some of these motifs, as they are in principle\nseparable from the ransom theory, and have been used as elements of\nother accounts of atonement.\n4.2 Three Motifs\n4.2.1 The Recapitulation Motif\n\nIrenaeus, an early Church father, is famous for saying that\nChrist\u2019s entire life and death recapitulate what Adam has done\nto spread sin in humanity. Adam is not just an individual, but a\nrepresentative for humanity who has set humanity on the course of sin.\nChrist is viewed as the new Adam, who reverses what Adam did for\nhumanity. Recapitulation aims at restoring humanity to how it was\nmeant to be. It does this by summing up in Christ\u2019s life the\nsort of obstacles humans have faced, but reversing what humanity,\nfollowing Adam, has done in the face of those obstacles (Turner 1952).\nWhere humanity sinned and was disobedient, Christ was sinless and\nobedient. Irenaeus uses this theme to explain in granular detail some\nof the specific events of Christ\u2019s life. For instance, because\nAdam committed the first sin in regard to a tree, Christ needs to\nfinally defeat sin in obedience in regard to a tree\u2014i.e., by\nhanging on the cross (AH V.16.2).\n\nRecapitulation, if seen as a requirement for how sin must be defeated,\nprovides an additional tool to use to explain why Christ\u2019s life\ntook the particular shape it did. Of course, the main question it\nfaces is this: why should recapitulation provide strictures as to how\nsin is defeated? (Rashdall 1920: 233ff) One answer is that there is a\ncertain sort of beauty to the structure (McNall 2019: 34). Another is\nthat if Christ is to operate as a representative for humanity in\ncombatting evil, he should in his actions sum up the full range of\nhumanity\u2019s experience with evil and counteract it (McNall 2019:\n40).\n4.2.2 The Divinization/Healing Motif\n\nMany of the early Greek Church fathers\u2014including Gregory of\nNazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Athanasius\u2014emphasize this motif\n(although it is also found in the Latin tradition). Athanasius states\nit simply: \u201cHe [i.e., Christ, the word of God]\u2026assumed\nhumanity that we might become God\u201d (On the Incarnation\n[1993: 93]). God the Son assumes a human nature to divinize\nit\u2014to restore the image of God in humanity that has been\ntarnished by sin and to heal our nature that had become sick and\nsubject to corruption. Humans cannot cure themselves of the problem\nwith their nature, and so the cure must come from a divine source that\nunites with their human nature, \u201cfor a sick man cannot be healed\nunless the ailing part of him in particular receives the cure\u201d\n(Gregory of Nyssa An Address [1954: 305]). The cure includes\nsaving humans from death, which Christ accomplishes through his own\ndeath (Myers 2015).\n\nThis motif is used to explain why God became incarnate, and it implies\nthat all of Christ\u2019s life plays some role in healing human\nnature. And since healing human nature is needed for reconciliation\nwith God, and thus for atonement, mere repentance is not sufficient\n(Athanasius On the Incarnation [1993: 33]) for atonement.\n\nThe main question for this motif is: how does the incarnation of the\nSon of God bring about divinization/healing of humans? The usual\nanswer appeals to the solidarity of humankind together with the Son of\nGod\u2019s ability, like Adam, to affect all of humanity through his\nactions (De Lubac 1947 [1988]; Mersch 1933/1938 [2011]). All of\nhumanity exists in a union of sorts, constituting \u201ca single\nliving organism\u201d (Gregory of Nyssa An Address [1954:\n310]). By uniting himself with this organism, God the Son\u2014who\nbecomes the Head of humanity\u2014can convey his renewed human nature\nto other humans in the organism, thus healing\n them.[34]\n4.2.3 Vicarious Substitute/Representative Motif\n\nThis motif, rooted in the Christian scriptures, is common throughout\nthe history of Christian thought (Gathercole 2015; Bynum 2004). This\nmotif is often combined with seeing Christ\u2019s atoning\nwork\u2014especially his death\u2014as a sacrifice. Sometimes\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is understood as substitutionary: he does\nit instead of those who ought to have done it (or something\nequivalent), releasing them of any obligation to do it. Athanasius,\nfor example, says that humans have a debt that needs to be paid due to\nsin\u2014a debt of death\u2014and Christ becomes \u201cin dying a\nsufficient exchange for all\u201d (On the Incarnation [1993:\n35]). Christ\u2019s atoning work is also sometimes regarded as\nrepresentative: he represents humans, and so what he does to atone\ncounts as what we humans need to do to atone. The divinization/healing\nmotif is often coupled with seeing Christ as a representative.\n\nThe main challenge for this motif is to explain how Christ is a\nsubstitute or a representative and, as such, how his atoning work can\nremove the need or duty for non-divine humans to atone for their sin.\nEach theory that incorporates this motif\u2014and most theories do,\none way or another\u2014replies to this challenge differently.\n4.3 Anselm\u2019s Satisfaction Theory\n\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory in Curs Deus Homo (abbr.\nCDH as noted above) is the most influential account of the\nChristian doctrine of atonement. Nearly everything written since\ndefines itself as a defense, development, or rejection of (and\nalternative to) Anselm\u2019s theory.\n\nAnselm\u2019s argument in CDH moves through four steps\n(Thurow 2017b: 433).\n\nStep 1:\nIn order to be saved, humans must offer satisfaction to God for\nwhat they have taken from God in sinning against him.\nStep 2:\nOnly God incarnated as a human descendant of Adam will be able to\noffer adequate satisfaction for human sin.\nStep 3:\nAt least some humans will be saved.\nStep 4:\nBy dying in service of God, God incarnate provides an adequate and\nmost fitting satisfaction for human sin.\n\n\nSteps 1, 2, and 4 give us the heart of Anselm\u2019s theory of\n atonement.[35]\n\nStep 1\n is supported as follows (see CDH I.10\u201314,19,22,24).\nHumans have sinned and sin dishonors God. A just God cannot tolerate\nthe injustice of dishonor, and so sinners must either offer\nsatisfaction that adequately compensates for the dishonor done to God,\nor suffer punishment. But the punishment due for sin against God is\neternal death. Thus, if humans are to be saved from eternal death,\nthey must instead offer adequate satisfaction.\n\nIn support of\n step 2,\n Anselm argues (in short) that humans are so mired in sin, and the\ndisvalue of sin is so great because of God\u2019s nature, that no\nnon-divine human can offer adequate\n satisfaction.[36]\n However, it is \u201cnecessary that the person paying recompense\nshould be identical with the sinner, or a member of the same\nrace\u201d (CDH II.8 [1998: 321]). God\u2014being divine,\nmorally perfect, and having no debt of sin\u2014could offer adequate\nsatisfaction. Thus, adequate satisfaction can only be offered by a\nhuman descendant of Adam who is also God\u2014i.e., God\nincarnate.\n\nFor\n step 4,\n Anselm argues that whatever God incarnate does to satisfy for human\nsin must be supererogatory. Living a perfect life is required of all,\nincluding Christ. But dying in service of God is supererogatory and,\nbecause of the value of God himself, has far greater value than does\nthe debt of human sin (CDH II.10\u201311, 14\u201315).\nFurthermore, this satisfaction is fitting in other ways: it involves\npain (CDH II.11), which counters the pleasure of sin, it\ndecisively conquers Satan (CDH I.22\u201323), and it is a\nbetter example of service to God than one that does not involve his\ndeath (CDH II.18). Anselm here weaves in elements of\nrecapitulation, ransom, and moral influence views. Since God incarnate\nperformed a great act of supererogation for God the Father, he is owed\ncompensation. God incarnate desires the merit of his supererogatory\nact be used as satisfaction for human sin.\n\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory has been criticized on several\ngrounds. Some criticisms conflate the satisfaction theory with penal\nsubstitution and reject both for problems leveled chiefly at penal\nsubstitution (Gorringe 1996, for example). However, Anselm\u2019s\ntheory is notable for saying that God precisely does not punish humans\nfor their sin. Rather, punishment is avoided by Christ\u2019s\nsatisfaction for human sin.\n\nMany object that Anselm\u2019s notion of honor is at heart a feudal\nnotion, both foreign to the Biblical context and not one that we\nshould attribute to God (see Whidden 2011 for\n examples).[37]\n Others have contested this charge, arguing that Anselm\u2019s notion\nof satisfaction has far older roots not connected with feudalism\n(Anderson 2009; Crisp 2020a: 71; Mansini 1987; Whidden 2011) and that\nit fits into his broader metaphysical notion of rectitude\u2014things\nbeing as they should, as rightly ordered, or as morally ordered by God\n(R. Campbell 1998; McGrath 1981).\n\nThe theologian Faustus Socinus is famous for leveling a series of\nobjections against objective theories of the atonement (Grensted\n1920). Two of those objections target satisfaction views specifically.\nFirst, if satisfaction is made for sin, then God does not pardon or\nforgive. But scripture plainly asserts that God forgives humans for\nsin, thus the satisfaction view must be false. This objection,\nhowever, depends upon the debt-canceling view of forgiveness, which\nhas been contested (Pettigrove 2012) and conflicts with other views of\nforgiveness described in\n section 1.3.2.\n Second, Socinus argues that Anselm\u2019s allowance of someone of\nthe same race to make satisfaction for human sin is unmotivated and\ncontrary to our moral standards\u2014the sinner and the sinner alone\nshould pay the price. However, given that for Anselm the\n\u201cprice\u201d seems to be reparative, people other than the\nsinner can help atone by helping repair its harmful effects (Purtill\n1990).\n\nScotus objects to Anselm\u2019s calculation of the infinite debt\nresulting from sin against God. He argues that sin produces a finite\ndebt arising from loving or pursuing a finite thing improperly. Humans\ncan perform supererogatory acts, which they can use as satisfaction to\npay this finite debt (see Burns 1975).\n\nCross (2001) argues that sin against God, when it does not have other\nharmful consequences, is a deprivation of service and one only need\ngenuinely apologize and repent to atone in such cases. One must repair\nharmful consequences to humans, but beyond that no further reparation\nis owed to\n God.[38]\n\nStump (2018) objects that Anselm (and many other views) regards\nGod\u2019s forgiveness as conditional upon and responsive to\nChrist\u2019s satisfaction for human sin. This, she claims, is\ncontrary to God\u2019s love, which entails unconditional and\nunilateral forgiveness. Some have objected to Stump\u2019s view of\nGod\u2019s love and forgiveness (Craig 2019; J. Rutledge 2022;\nSwinburne 2019; Thurow & Strabbing 2020; Warmke 2019). Thurow and\nStrabbing (2020) argue that Anselm\u2019s notion of forgiveness is\ndifferent from Stump\u2019s and, in any case, Anselm is more\nconcerned to argue that reconciliation is conditional upon\nsatisfaction.\n\nLombardo (2013) objects that Anselm is committed to saying that God\nwills Christ\u2019s death and the moral evil that causes his death,\nneither of which a good God would do. Anselm tries to dodge this\nconcern in CDH, however Lombardo argues that his attempts all\nfail; they either render his view unable to explain why God became\nhuman or result in a tension within the Trinity.\n\nLastly, many have criticized Anselm\u2019s view for not accounting\nfor how humans are to respond to and adopt Christ\u2019s atoning work\nfor themselves (e.g., Grensted 1920; Crisp 2020a). However, this\nlacuna may be due to the narrow goal of the CDH; Anselm\nelsewhere shows deep sensitivity to the importance of human repentance\nand faith in becoming reconciled to God (Thurow & Strabbing\n 2020).[39]\n\nContemporary defenses of Anselm\u2019s view, or modified\nsatisfactions views, can be found in Anderson 2009; Aspenson 1990;\nFarris & Hamilton 2018; Rogers 2001; Shannon 2009; Sonderegger\n2017 and perhaps most prominently in the work of Richard Swinburne,\nwhich will be discussed in\n section 5.2.\n4.4 Penal Substitution\n\nPenal substitution has been defended by many in the Reformed and more\nbroadly evangelical tradition. It has strong roots in Luther and\nCalvin; there has been considerable debate about whether there are\nearlier\n precursors.[40]\n On this view Christ, instead of paying satisfaction for human sin,\nsuffers punishment on behalf of humans for human sin. God\u2019s\njustice is thus satisfied, enabling God and humans to be reconciled\n(Schreiner 2006a).\n\nWilliam Lane Craig, however, defines the view more broadly\n\n\nas the doctrine that God inflicted upon Christ the suffering that we\ndeserved as the punishment for our sins, as a result of which we no\nlonger deserve punishment. (2020: 147)\n\n\nOn this definition one could hold that Christ was not punished; he\nmerely experienced sufferings that would have constituted punishment\nif we mere humans had endured them. Somehow, though, in virtue of his\nenduring these sufferings, \u201cwe no longer deserve\npunishment\u201d. How could that be? One option is to say that we\nmere humans are punished through Christ enduring these sufferings. M.\nMurphy (2009) calls this a \u201cvicarious punishment\u201d view,\nwhich he distinguishes from penal substitution. A second option is to\nsay that the debt of punishment is a collective debt humanity owes to\nGod and that Christ, through his death, pays it on behalf of the human\ncommunity. Humanity is punished, but Christ is not, on this view\n(Thurow 2015). A third option is to say that nobody is punished. Hard\ntreatment can be endured by an innocent third party\u2014and this\nisn\u2019t regarded as punishment of the third party or anyone\nelse\u2014in virtue of which the guilty party\u2019s debt of\npunishment is canceled (Quinn 1994: 298). We can call this the\n\u201cpenal cancellation\u201d view.\n\nAdvocates of penal substitution tend to defend it on three grounds.\nFirst, they argue that a proper interpretation of scripture demands a\npenal substitutionary view (see, e.g., Craig 2020; S. Jeffrey et al.\n(2007); Schreiner 2006a; Stott 1986). This claim has been widely\ncontested (see, e.g., Belousek-Snyder 2011; Eberhart 2011). Second,\nthey accept something like what Purtill (1990) calls \u201cstrict\nretributionism\u201d\u2014the demands of justice require that proper\npunishment be delivered\u2014alongside the idea that if mere humans\nreceived this justice they would be separated from God forever in\neternal damnation. Strict retributionism has also been widely\ncontested (see, e.g., Purtill 1990). Third, some (Porter 2002; 2004)\nreject strict retributionism in favor of what we might call\n\u201cpenal goodness\u201d\u2014it is good for sinners to be\npunished, even if they have repented, apologized, and made reparation,\nas it sends a message about the seriousness of sin. Although\nGod\u2019s justice does not require that he punish sinners, because\nof this good aspect of punishment, he does\n punish.[41]\n\nPenal substitution faces a host of objections. Some of the objections\nto satisfaction theory also target penal\n substitution.[42]\n Others specifically target penal substitution; three have been\nparticularly influential.\n\nOne objection is that penal substitution is incoherent because\npunishment necessarily expresses condemnation of the person punished,\nbut Christ surely is not condemned when he suffers and dies on the\ncross.\n Section 2.8\n above discusses this objection and some replies. Here one further\nreply should be mentioned. Some defenders of penal substitution, such\nas the Reformed theologian Turretin, believe that human sins are\nimputed to Christ\u2014that is, Christ is treated legally as if he\nhad sinned, or human guilt for sin is transferred or replicated in\nChrist. If sins are imputed to Christ, then Christ may well be\ncondemned for sin since he then would at least bear guilt for human\nsin (Craig 2020: 161). Imputation has been objected to on the grounds\nthat there is no area of morality where imputation seems possible (M.\nMurphy 2009; Crisp 2020a. Craig replies that God, as the ultimate\nlawgiver, has sole authority to impute sins and so it isn\u2019t\nsurprising we don\u2019t accept it in other areas of morality or law.\nHe also finds analogies to imputation in our law from legal fictions\n(e.g., treating a ship as a person) and vicarious liability (e.g.,\nholding employers liable for acts done by employees in their role as\nemployees).\n\nA second objection is that, on the penal substitution view, justice\nisn\u2019t done because the full punishment isn\u2019t paid by the\nsubstitute. The full punishment due for sin, according to penal\nsubstitution, is eternal separation from God. However, Christ plainly\ndoes not suffer eternal separation from God.\n\nOne reply is that during and while dead, Christ endures enough\nsuffering to match the suffering of those eternally separated from God\n(Craig 2020: 209). However, the punishment for sin isn\u2019t just\nthe suffering\u2014it\u2019s the eternal separation. No amount of\nsuffering matches eternal separation (Stump 2018: 78). A second reply\nis that God, in his divine authority, may accept a lesser punishment\nin place of full punishment (Turretin\n 1978).[43]\n\nThe third objection is perhaps the most influential: penal\nsubstitution of the sort supposedly involved in the atonement is\nimmoral. Perhaps an innocent person paying a guilty person\u2019s\npenal fine is morally acceptable, but punishment that involves hard\ntreatment such as the death penalty, imprisonment, and lashings cannot\nbe justly leveled upon an innocent, even willing, third party. We do\nnot have the hint of an intuition that it would be just, say, for an\ninnocent mother to willingly take on the death penalty due her son for\nmurder.\n\nOne reply is that God in his authority\u2014in virtue of divine\ncommand theory\u2014can accept what he will to fulfill justice. If he\nchooses to accept a substitute, then that is just (Craig 2020:\n 177).[44]\n The second reply is that, although penal substitution is rarely\njustified, there are plausible conditions in which it would be\njustified and in the case of human sin and Christ being God incarnate,\nthose conditions are met (Strabbing 2016).\n4.5 Moral Influence\n\nMoral influence views say that Christ atones for human sin by\ninfluencing humans to live a morally good life. In effect, these views\nemphasize the moral transformation aspect of atonement. This view is\noften attributed to the twelfth century theologian\n Abelard.[45]\n Contemporary scholarship has tended to see Abelard\u2019s view as\nmore sophisticated (Quinn 1993; Weingart 1970), although some still\nargue that Abelard is best understood as embracing a moral influence\ntheory (Pugh 2014). Many theologians of the German\nAufkl\u00e4rung endorsed moral influence views (McGrath\n1985), as did Socinus (1668), Kant (1793 [1998]), Rashdall (1920) and,\nmore recently, Hick (1993 [2005]).\n\nMoral influence views differ regarding the mechanism by which humans\nare influenced to live morally. The moral exemplar view says that\nChrist is an example of a morally excellent life. The mechanism of\ninfluence is inspiration\u2014Christ\u2019s example inspires us to\ngreater moral heights. This view has been repeatedly criticized for\n(i) downplaying the fact that humans have sinned and thus need to be\nreconciled to God, not just inspired to live better (McGrath 1985),\nand (ii) offering too thin a mechanism (Crisp 2020b). To be a model\nfor inspiration does not make us righteous and does not overcome the\nforces preventing us from being righteous. To put it another way, on\nthe moral exemplar view Christ does not atone for humans, but at most\nhe motivates humans to atone.\n\nMore sophisticated moral influence views work around the above\nobjections. They can say that Christ\u2019s death shows the depth of\nhuman depravity, inspiring humans not just to want to be better\npeople, but also to see more clearly their own sins and to repent for\nthose sins. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit\u2014the third person of the\nTrinity\u2014works to bring about transformation within a person who\nis open to receiving it (Moberly 1924). The Holy Spirit can transform\npeople and undo obstacles to transformation that would be difficult or\nimpossible to manage without God\u2019s help.\n\nHowever, even these more sophisticated views face a host of\nobjections:\n\nthey do not adequately account for the Biblical ideas that\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is substitutionary, representative, and\nexpiatory (Crisp 2020b),\nthey cannot explain why Christ\u2019s death is crucial for\natonement (Pugh 2014: 132), and\nthey cannot account for the Biblical language of sacrifice.\n\n5. Recent Theories\n5.1 Christus Victor Theories\n\nAul\u00e9n\u2019s (1930 [1931]) study of patristic views of\natonement led to a flourishing of that approach in theological\nliterature into the twenty-first century. Christus Victor views\nhighlight the ransom motif from scripture: humans are in some way\nenslaved to the power of sin and their only escape from its power can\ncome from a rescuer, Jesus Christ, who will free humans from its\npower. However, contemporary views rarely espouse the ransom theory\ndescribed above.\n\nSome, such as Gregory Boyd (2006), take seriously Satan\u2019s\nexistence and the reality of demonic activity, and argue that\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is aimed at undermining their influence\nover humans. Christ does this through his teaching, healing, and\nexorcism ministry. But his death and resurrection constitute his\nultimate defeat of Satan, as he allows Satan to influence humans to\nkill him, only to show that Satan cannot win. Christ\u2019s\nresurrection is central to atonement, on this view, as it is a\ndemonstration of defeat over Satan\u2019s worst.\n\nOthers, such as Darby Kathleen Ray (1998), J. Denny Weaver (2001), and\nWalter Wink (1992), demythologize the Christus Victor view. What\nhumans need to be freed from is not literal demons, but a sort of\ndepersonalized power of evil that humans have allowed to infect their\ninstitutions, organizations, and cultures. Christ combats the power of\nevil nonviolently. In doing so, particularly through his death, he\nunmasks evil by showing it at its worst. When humans see evil\nunmasked, and then see that Christ defeats its worst by being\nresurrected, humans are drawn instead to God\u2019s way of life and\nhis response to evil.\n\nChristus Victor theories have been criticized on various grounds (some\nare only relevant to certain specific theories). First, they do not\naccount for the importance of Christ\u2019s crucifixion for atonement\n(Thurow 2021a). The victory over the powers could have been obtained\nin so many ways (and indeed is obtained in ways other than his death)\nnot involving the death of the innocent son of God. Second, they\ndownplay individual responsibility for sin (Schreiner 2006b). This can\nmake it seem like the Christus Victor accounts don\u2019t offer a\ntheory of atonement since they do not explain how the wrong done to\nGod by human sin is resolved (Crisp 2020a: 55). Lastly, if the primary\nmechanism of atonement is to free humans from the power of sin,\nempirical evidence indicates that this hasn\u2019t been achieved\n(Reichenbach 2006). And yet, Christ is said to have already atoned for\nhuman sin.\n5.2 Another Satisfaction Theory\n\nSwinburne\u2019s theory of atonement is Anselmian, although it\ndispenses with Anselm\u2019s calculus about how valuable the\nsatisfaction must be in order to atone. According to Swinburne (1989),\natonement has four components: repentance, apology, reparation, and\npenance (see\n section 2.6\n for a description of Swinburne\u2019s notion of penance). For less\nsevere wrongs, repentance and apology may suffice to atone, but for\nmore serious wrongs\u2014especially those that cause harm aside from\nthe offense itself\u2014reparation and penance are required. Since\nhuman sin is immense and immensely harmful, humans must make\nreparation and penance for sin\u2014and not only for their own\npersonal sin, but also for the sins of their forebears, to whom they\nowe a debt of helping to repair their moral debts. However, the victim\nmay determine what counts as adequate satisfaction for wrongdoing.\nChrist\u2019s entire life lived in obedience and service to God,\nwhich caused his death at the hands of his enemies, was offered by\nChrist as a reparation and penance for human sin. Humans can adopt it\nas their own reparation and penance by adding to it their personal\nrepentance and apology.\n\nSwinburne\u2019s theory evades many of the objections to\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory presented in\n section 4.3\n (although Hick 1994 argues that some of the classic objections\napply). He has responded to Stump\u2019s objection that his view\nmakes forgiveness contingent by arguing that Stump\u2019s view of\nforgiveness is not well reflected in Christ\u2019s view of\nforgiveness, whereas his is (Swinburne 2019). Cross\u2019s and\nLombardo\u2019s objections have yet to be rebutted.\n\nPorter (2004), among others (Quinn 1994; Stump 2018; Thurow 2021a),\nobjects that Swinburne\u2019s theory does not explain why\nChrist\u2019s death is distinctly important for atonement. His\nperfect life is what appears to do the reparative work; his death\nappears to be simply a causal consequence of that work, but not\nsomething in virtue of which reparation is made. Hick (1994) adds that\nsince Swinburne thinks God could have accepted a supererogatory act\nfrom a mere human or angel as satisfaction, it is hard to see why God\nwould instead use the horrific death of the Son of God as\nsatisfaction. McNaughton (1992) and Aspenson (1996) present other\ncritiques.\n5.3 Marian/Thomistic Theory\n\nBuilding upon her earlier interpretations and developments of\nAquinas\u2019s views on atonement (Stump 1988; 2003), Eleonore Stump\n(2018) defends what she calls a Marian theory of atonement (named\nafter the many Marys in the New Testament). According to this theory,\nChrist\u2019s atonement is aimed at bringing humans into union with\nGod in love. To be united in love, both parties must share attention\nwith each other and desire the other wholeheartedly. Guilt and shame\ndue to human sin, and its resultant stain on the soul, prevent humans\nfrom embracing union with God. God is fully ready to reconcile; the\nonly thing preventing reconciliation is human resistance to God.\nChrist\u2019s atoning work enables, in several ways, a bond of love\nbetween humans and God. First, Christ experiences on the cross what it\nis like to commit every single human sin in history, and thus God is\nattentive in a second-person way to humans. Second, Christ\u2019s\ndeath on the cross is the best way for God to melt the hearts of\nhumans, who resist accepting God\u2019s love. Those who thus\nsurrender to God receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, which gives them\na second-person awareness of God, and gives them a desire to desire\nGod, which in time sanctifies humans to bring their first-order\ndesires in line with this second-order desire. Through this process\nall of the obstacles to reconciliation from guilt, shame, and stain on\nthe soul, are dealt with.\n\nStump justifies her view in part by repudiating Anselmian views and\ninsisting that God\u2019s forgiveness and readiness for\nreconciliation is universal and unconditional. As noted in\n section 4.3,\n several have questioned her views about love and forgiveness. Thurow\nand Strabbing (2020) argue that the core of Anselm\u2019s\nview\u2014that human sin is so bad that repentant sinners ought to\nand will want to offer satisfaction to God\u2014is plausible and can\nbe incorporated into Stump\u2019s account of atonement. They also\nquestion her account of surrendering to God. Others have questioned\nhow Stump\u2019s view would account for restoring damage to nature\nfrom human sin (Pawl 2021) and for atoning for social sin (Pogin\n2021). Dougherty (2019), A. Jeffrey (2021), and Rea (2019) critique\nother details. Stump (2019; 2021) responds to some of these\nconcerns.\n5.4 Participation Theories\n\nParticipation theories take as their starting point various statements\nof the apostle Paul:\n\n\u201cI have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but\nChrist lives in me\u201d (Galatians 2:19\u201320),\n\u201cwe were therefore buried with him through baptism into\ndeath in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through\nthe glory of the Father, we too may live a new life\u201d (Romans\n6:4),\n\u201cwe were baptized by one Spirit into one body\u201d (1Cor.\n12:13) and\nChrist is the head of the body (Colossians 1:18).\n\n\nParticipation theories take these statements to indicate that\natonement works by humans being in some way united with Christ, so\nthat what he does is done also for them, which also effects healing in\nhuman hearts and minds. These theories thus emphasize the\n divinization/healing motif,\n where this healing is brought about through participation in a union\nwith Christ.\n\nBayne and Restall (2009) argue that participation theories do a better\njob than other theories of explaining why the incarnation is important\nfor atonement, and that they rightly view sin as a pollution that\nproduces a relational problem (rather than as a deontic matter of\nfailing in a duty). Crisp (2016; 2020a) advocates for a theory that\nemploys a robust notion of union. All fallen humans are part of a\nfour-dimensional entity, fallen humanity. Christ becomes human and\ncreates a new four-dimensional entity, redeemed humanity, of those who\njoin themselves to him in faith and love. The Holy Spirit brings about\ntransformation in the merely human members of redeemed\nhumanity\u2014using Christ\u2019s atoning work to bring about\ntransformation. Gorman\u2019s (2014) new-covenant model understands\nunion to result from a covenant, and what Christ\u2019s atonement\ndoes is form a new covenant through which various benefits flow to its\nmembers.\n5.5 Mashup Theories\n\nMany people want to combine elements of different theories into one\nlarger theory. Sometimes this is done by centering one theory while\nbuilding elements of other theories around it (e.g., Packer 1974, who\ncenters penal substitution). But one could also attempt to bring\nseveral theories together without centering any one. Crisp (2020a)\ncalls these \u201cmashup theories\u201d. Examples include Boersma\n(2004; 2006), who uses Irenaeus\u2019s notion of recapitulation to\ntie together Christus Victor, penal substitution, and moral influence,\nand McNall (2019), who tries to integrate the same theories together\nusing the metaphor of a mosaic in which each theory depicts part of a\nmosaic of Christ. Some have objected to mashup theories on the grounds\nthat each theory has a different internal logic\u2014a different\n\u201ctarget\u201d of atonement\u2014and purports to present a\ncentral mechanism for how Christ atones (Weaver 2006). Baker and Green\nendorse a kaleidoscope approach to theories of atonement which,\nalthough superficially similar to mashup theories, regards all\ntheories as culturally conditioned and limited, although valuable,\nways to understand Christ\u2019s atonement (Baker & Green 2011;\nGreen 2006). Others have defended the mashup approach. Gunton (1989)\nconstrues the classic atonement theories as built around different\nguiding metaphors that can and should be combined to provide a fuller\nunderstanding of Christ\u2019s atonement. Thurow (2021b) argues that\nsince atonement aims at reconciliation, and there are various\ndimensions to reconciling, a theory of atonement could view different\nclassic theories as articulating different dimensions of atonement\ncorresponding to unique dimensions of reconciliation.\n6. Collective Atonement\n\nIn everyday speech we sometimes talk of collectives (or groups)\noffering atonement or being the recipients of atonement. For example,\npeople discuss whether Germany has sufficiently atoned for its Nazi\npast (M. Smith 2019\n [Other Internet Resources])\n and how the Canadian government has atoned for its mistreatment of\nindigenous populations (Skylstad 2021\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n and Roman Catholic popes have apologized for the role of the Church\nin the sexual abuse scandal and in harm to native people during the\nconquest of the Americas (Cunningham\n 2022).[46]\n There is considerable dispute about how to understand these\nattributions of responsibility to collectives and the moral action of\nthe collectives (see the entry on\n collective responsibility\n for details). Some take them at face value and accept a realm of\ncollective responsibility that is distinct from the individual\nresponsibility born by members of the collective (e.g., Isaacs 2011).\nOthers object that only individuals can be responsible for actions and\nthat groups can be regarded as responsible in only a metaphorical\nsense (e.g., H. D. Lewis 1948; Narveson 2002).\n\nBoth approaches have a range of important moral phenomena to explain.\nThese include: apology for a collective and how in some cases victims\nfeel that an apology from a group is more needed than an apology from\nindividual members of the group; collective responsibility for\nhistorical injustices when no currently existing member of the group\ncommitted or aided anyone in committing any of the injustices; the\nsense of guilt or shame at being a member of a collective that has\nwronged people; morally acceptable collective punishment; that\nindividuals in a guilty group can have varying degrees of\nresponsibility connected to the action for which the group is guilty.\n(See French & Wettstein 2006, 2014; Isaacs & Vernon 2011; and\nMay & Hoffman 1991 for important collections of essays on these\nand other related issues.)\n\nCollective atonement is one of these phenomena. Insofar as groups can\nbe responsible for actions or states of affairs in the world, they can\nalso be responsible for atoning for the same. Since atonement aims at\nreconciliation, collective atonement would aim at reconciling one\ngroup with another individual or group. Roy Brooks, for example,\nargues that \u201cracial reconciliation should be the primary purpose\nof racial redress\u201d (2004: 141). He thus presents what he calls\nan atonement model for black reparations, according to which\nreconciliation is the goal, which is to be achieved through government\napology and reparation. Reparations are needed not only because of the\nextent of the harm done but because they are \u201cessential to\natonement\u201d, as they \u201cmake apologies believable\u201d\n(2004: 142). Even if there are no agents literally collectively\nresponsible for anything, there are bad social facts and relations\nthat can cause and result from wrongdoing\u2014these are sometimes\ncalled social evils or social sins (John Paul II 1984). Sometimes\nadequate atonement will require making reparations for social\nevils.\n\nSome reflections on the Christian doctrine of atonement make use of\nnotions of collectivity. The version of the\n divinization/healing motif\n that highlights Christ\u2019s role as a second Adam and as the Head\nof humanity (or the Church) posits that Christ\u2019s acting as a\nrepresentative for a collective entity is part of how he atones for\nhuman sin. The Hebrew scriptures contain a clear notion of collective\nresponsibility, illustrated most clearly in the Day of Atonement\nrituals (Milgrom 1991) and this notion may influence the New Testament\nconception of Christ as a priest offering the sacrifice of himself.\nSome argue that Anselm regards, or is committed to regarding, Christ\nas atoning for collective sin (D. Brown 2004; Thurow 2017b; for a\ndifferent reading see Rogers 2012). Drawing on these sources, Thurow\n2015 develops a theory of atonement on which Christ atones primarily\nfor the collective sins of humanity and secondarily for the sins of\nindividual humans who join themselves to Christ in faith and\nrepentance.\n7. Feminist and Womanist Approaches to Atonement\n\nFeminist and womanist scholars have argued that our understanding of\natonement needs to be transformed by an awareness that (i) women\nthroughout history in many cultures have suffered many wrongs while\ntheir culture ignored or belittled their need for atonement/amends,\nwhile at the same time (ii) in many cultures women have born the\nburden of repairing moral fragmentation that happens in households\n(Spelman 2002: 26ff). As a result, women have faced a sort of\noppression in relation to atonement: they are held responsible for\nhelping make amends for other peoples\u2019 (often men\u2019s)\nwrongs, while their own need for atonement is sidelined. Many feminist\nand womanist theologians and philosophers have argued that these\nfacts, and others grounded in women\u2019s experiences, are grounds\nfor critique of traditional theories of the Christian doctrine of\natonement.\n\nTanner (2010: 249f) observes that several feminist criticisms are in\nline with other standard criticisms in the history of theological\nargument. Some question the character of God as depicted in the\nclassic atonement theories. J. Brown and Parker (1989) argue the\nclassic theories endorse divine child abuse, as Christ, the son of\nGod, suffers terribly at the Father\u2019s will for the sake of\nothers and their actions. Others question the mechanism of\natonement\u2014for instance, D. Williams (1991) argues that black\nwomen in America have historically had terrible experiences of coerced\nand voluntary surrogacy, acting as surrogate parents and household\nmanagers for white folks, performing field work, and providing sexual\npleasure to male slaveholders. Many traditional theories treat Christ\nas a substitute, or surrogate, who atones for human sin. The\nexperience of black women shows that even voluntary surrogacy is not\nnecessarily a great good.\n\nHowever, feminist and womanist critiques extend beyond the classic\ncritiques. One of their core claims is that\n\n\ntheologies of the cross are seen to be complicit in the oppression,\nvictimization and disempowerment of women. (Keshgegian 2000: 476; see\nalso Buck 2020)\n\n\nD. Williams suggests that\n\n\nthe image of the surrogate-God\u2026supports and reinforces the\nexploitation that has accompanied [black women\u2019s] experience\nwith surrogacy. (1991: 9)\n\n\nBrock and Parker (2001) present many stories of women who have\nsuffered from abuse and neglect at the hands of a partner and were\ntold by church members to endure the suffering\u2014even rejoice in\nit\u2014as it brings them closer to Christ who suffered on the\ncross.\n\n\nIf one extols the silent and freely-chosen suffering of Christ, who\nwas \u201cobedient unto death\u201d (Philippians 2:8), as an example\nto be imitated by all those victimized by patriarchal\noppression\u2026one not only legitimates but also enables acts of\nviolence against women and children. (Fiorenza 1994: 106)\n\n\nThis can in turn lead to a sort of hermeneutical injustice wherein\nwomen and other oppressed people are hindered from seeing that\nresisting injustice and standing up for one\u2019s own well-being are\npermissible and noble (Pogin 2020).\n\nIn response to these critiques, some endorse forms of the Christus\nVictor theory that treat Christ\u2019s death as a tragedy, not as an\nintrinsically redemptive act (Ray 1998; Weaver 2001), while others\nendorse a version of participation theory (Tanner 2010) on which\nChrist\u2019s divine life-giving power deeply manifest on the cross\nand humans can receive a share of that power through union with\nChrist. Some have defended Anselm\u2019s theory against the critiques\n(Keshgegian 2000). Some argue that a full appreciation of the doctrine\nof the Trinity can help evade some of the critiques (Crisp 2020).\n\nGu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir (2010; 2017) argues that some of the\ncritiques do not adequately distinguish between theology being abused\nand theology being essentially abusive. She thinks when a theology of\nthe cross glorifies suffering per se, theology is being abused.\nHowever, a theology of the cross\u2014and an account of\natonement\u2014need not be essentially abusive if it embraces the\nidea that suffering and death can be transformed into joy and life and\noffers hope of a better life to those who suffer unjustly.\n\nOne thing the feminist and womanist critiques show is that there is\nneed for further reflection on how the Christian doctrine of the\natonement ought to integrate with and impact human practices of\natonement.
