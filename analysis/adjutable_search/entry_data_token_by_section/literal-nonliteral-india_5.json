    "main_text": "Primary and Secondary Meaning || Lexical Meaning\n2.1 Lexical Meaning\nMost classical Indian thinkers (some Buddhists being an important exception, see section 4.1) understand word meaning, or pad\u0101rtha, to refer to objects in the world, and to do so directly. For these thinkers\u2014Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2014the referential function is primary. However, despite broad agreement about the basic referential function of words, they disagree about what its objects are. One such dispute, which has implications for the primary/secondary distinction, is over the relationship between words and universals. Kum\u0101rila argues that the primary referent of words is a universal. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s reasoning is that, without words denoting the universal property belonging to, for example, all cows, there would not be a permanent (nitya) relationship between word and referent. For if \u201ccow\u201d means a specific cow, Bessie, when Bessie goes out of existence, the word lacks denotation (\u015aV). Further, the Vedic injunction, \u201cA cow is to be tied up,\u201d can be followed in numerous rituals\u2014but if a specific cow were intended, it could be followed only once. (This argument is found in early Grammatical thought as well, see below.) Still, despite the fact that all M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas accept the requirement of fixity of word and referent, they do not all accept the universal-denotation view. Some agree with another philosopher, roughly contemporaneous with Kum\u0101rila, Prabh\u0101kara (his followers are known as \u201cPr\u0101bh\u0101karas,\u201d with the first long \u201c\u0101\u201d equivalent to the English \u201c-an\u201d as in \u201cFregean\u201d). They reject the universal-denotation view in connection with their view of sentence meaning (see sections 4.3 and 5.1).\nIn contrast, in the NS and its commentaries, Ny\u0101ya philosophers argue that words refer to universals, forms, and individual things. They point out that universals are never instantiated without particular things, and so the universal alone cannot be the referent. But likewise, since universals are identified by form (a cow is recognized as having cowhood by its particular structure), we must also take it into account. Replying to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers who defend and refine the universals-denotation view, along with other opponents who defend individual- and form-only views, Ny\u0101ya philosophers defend and refine the context-dependent view. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, for example, in the Commentary on Ny\u0101ya (Ny\u0101yabh\u0101\u1e63ya, hereafter NBh), argues for an epistemic point, that \u201cIt is not known which among these is the object or meaning of the word, or whether all of them might be meant\u201d (NBh 2.2.59; Dasti and Phillips 2017). He takes on arguments from interlocutors who argue that only the individual or the universal is meant by words. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana observes that, to take the example of \u201ccow\u201d again, one never encounters a bare particular (individual). Rather, the individual cow is always found to be qualified by the universal. Ceteris paribus for universals, which do not exist apart from individuals. So it is possible that both universal and particular are meant together, along with form or shape (\u0101kr\u0323ti), though in a structured relationship where one is predominant and the others are subsidiary, the particular structure depending on context. See Dasti 2020 for a summary of early Ny\u0101ya arguments.\nGrammarians also consider the question of word reference. P\u0101\u1e47ini takes at least a partial position on the question, claiming that if words only refer to particulars, then someone who ties up one cow for a sacrifice, in response to a Vedic command, would be in error if they, in a later ritual, tie up another cow, as the command could only refer to a single specific animal (Eight Chapters 1.2.64). After him, Pata\u00f1jali, in the Great Commentary, refers to two earlier grammarians (whose work is not independently available), Vy\u0101\u1e0di and V\u0101japy\u0101yana, who differ on this topic. Vy\u0101\u1e0di argues that words primarily refer to particulars and V\u0101japy\u0101yana claims they refer to universals. Pata\u00f1jali splits the difference, claiming that both aspects are part of word-meaning, but which one is primary may vary (see Deshpande 2003; VM; and Matilal 1971.) Matilal illustrates the moves in the debate with the example of a compound, \u201ca brave-man\u201d (Sanskrit: v\u012bra-puru\u1e63a\u1e25). V\u0101japy\u0101yana would argue that if \u201cbrave\u201d refers to the attribute of braveness, and \u201cman\u201d to the attribute of manhood, then these two referents can be related together in an underlying, unifying substratum (sam\u0101n\u0101dhikara\u1e47a). But if his opponent, Vy\u0101\u1e0di, were correct, there would be no way to make sense of the compound, since both terms would refer to the same individual, and thus there would be repetition. However, by making use of the distinction between expressed meaning and the implied ground for the meaning, Vy\u0101\u1e0di could reply: yes, \u201cbrave\u201d strictly refers to a brave man, but this word is used because of the man\u2019s braveness, whereas the other word is used because of the man\u2019s being a man.\nWhether the primary word-function results in a particular or universal, philosophers understand its resultant cognition as a basis for unhesitating action. Word meaning is treated in the context of epistemology and the topic of verbal testimony. The two sets of philosophers above, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas and Naiy\u0101yikas, both agree that verbal testimony is a way of knowing. However, for Ny\u0101ya philosophers, testimony is authoritative because of the speaker\u2019s characteristics while M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas emphasize the innately authoritative nature of statements, regardless of speaker, at at least when it comes to Vedic sentences. While they believe that sentences (v\u0101kya) are truth-bearers, and not individual words, since sentences are composed of words, Ny\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers focus on the invariable contributions of words to sentences\u2014their primary meanings. This emphasis, we will see, is not shared by everyone, as the grammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari rejects any ultimate metaphysical distinction between words and sentences, arguing that such divisions are provisional and arbitrary, even if useful in some contexts.\n",
