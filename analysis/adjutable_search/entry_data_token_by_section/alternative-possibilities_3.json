    "main_text": "Background || What is the Ability to Do Otherwise?\n1.3 What is the Ability to Do Otherwise?\n\nWhen a person, S, does something, what is it for her to have\nthe ability to do otherwise? For help we might look to alternative\nlocutions: S can do otherwise; S has the\npower to do otherwise; this is possible for\nS; the world in which S does otherwise is accessible\nto S; doing so is up to S; this is\nopen to S. But without further elaboration, these\naren\u2019t much more than synonyms for what\u2019s to be explained.\nNo theory of ability is adopted here, and for the most part we will\nrely on judgments about ability in particular cases. But a few general\nissues are worth flagging. (See also\n \u00a74.2.1\n and the entry on\n abilities.)\n\nS\u2019s being able to do otherwise is distinct from its\nmerely being possible that S do otherwise. Once Lisa the\nskydiver jumps out her plane, it is (logically) possible that she\nfloat in midair rather than fall. But it\u2019s not in her power to\ndo so: the world in which Lisa floats is not accessible to her. And if\nKurt is brainwashed to steal John\u2019s lunch, then while it\u2019s\npossible that he refrain, he nevertheless can\u2019t. Something must\nbe added to S\u2019s possibly doing something else to ensure\nit\u2019s within S\u2019s power to do so.\n\nAs Hume (1748 [1999: 158]) and others have argued, adding that it\nseems to S as if there are alternatives doesn\u2019t\nseem to help here (Chisholm 1967; Ginet 1990, 90\u20131). While the\nphenomenology of having alternatives\u2014and more generally, of\nagency\u2014is an important topic in its own right (Nagel 1986: ch.\n7; Horgan, Tienson, & Graham 2003), it does not secure the ability\nin question. Fred feels he can overcome the temptation to smoke, then\ndecides to smoke anyway. But it turns out that he could not have\nresisted his craving. Nor is seeming to have alternatives necessary\nfor having them. Fred\u2019s sister Fanny feels she is too weak to\novercome the temptation at noon to smoke, and in fact she does smoke\nat that time. But she was wrong about her own capacities: with just a\nbit of effort, she would have been able to resist.\n\nWhat these agents can or cannot do is relative to a set of facts, not\nall of which need be conscious. In the cases of Fred and Fanny, the\nfacts concern, among other things, the strengths of their cravings and\ntheir respective degrees of will-power. These are held fixed to\nevaluate their abilities. But what other facts are salient? There is\nno consensus on this issue, though it does seem that which facts are\nheld fixed can vary depending on context (Lewis 1976; Horgan 1979;\nUnger 1984). Such context-sensitivity is relevant to the proper\napplication of PAP. Keyne is confronted by a \u201cyour money or your\nlife\u201d mugger, and hands over his wallet. According to PAP,\nwhether Keyne is responsible for doing so turns, in part, on whether\nhe could have refused. So could he have? Considering the example in\none sort of context, we will say Yes: his arm was under his control\nand he was fully aware of what noncompliance involved and how to\nachieve it. But in another sort of context we might say No: Keyne was\nrational and valued his life far more than the money in his wallet, as\nwould any reasonable person such circumstances; fix this cognitive\nbackground, and the mugger\u2019s demand left him no other option. So\nin handing over his wallet, has Keyne met PAP\u2019s requirement on\nresponsibility or not? There seems to be no clear answer to this\nquestion. Complicating matters still further is that ability\u2014and\nin particular, the ability to do otherwise\u2014varies along a\ncontinuum. The motive power of a threat, mental disorder, or hypnotic\nsuggestion varies from mild to overwhelming. Where along this\ncontinuum does its influence becomes so strong as to preclude\nalternatives? There is no non-arbitrary line to draw here\u2014nor,\napparently, has science settled on one (Graham 2013: 186, citing Morse\n2011).\n\nThese points can make it difficult to test or apply PAP in particular\ncases. However, they do not by themselves entail that PAP is false, so\nlong as judgments of moral responsibility show a similar\ncontext-sensitivity and gradation. (On degrees of responsibility, see\nZimmerman 1988: ch. 3; Coates & Swenson 2013; Nelkin 2016.)\n",
