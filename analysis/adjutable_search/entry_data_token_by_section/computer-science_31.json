    "main_text": "The Epistemological Status of Computer Science || Computer Science as an Engineering Discipline\n8.3\u00a0Computer Science as a Scientific Discipline\n\nAs examined in\n \u00a76,\n because software testing and reliability measuring techniques are\nknown for their incapability of assuring for the absence of code\nfaults (Dijkstra 1970), in many cases, and especially for the\nevaluation of the so-called safety-critical systems (such as\ncontrollers of airplanes, rockets, nuclear plants etc..), a\ncombination of formal methods and empirical testing is used to\nevaluate correctness and dependability. Computer science can\naccordingly be understood as a scientific discipline, in that it makes\nuse of both deductive and inductive probabilistic reasoning to examine\ncomputational systems (Denning et al. 1981, 2005, 2007; Tichy 1998;\nColburn 2000).\n\nThe thesis that computer science is, from a methodological viewpoint,\non a par with empirical sciences traces back to Newell, Perlis, and\nSimon\u2019s 1967 letter to Science (Newell et al. 1967) and\ndominated all the 1980\u2019s (Wegner 1976). In the 1975 Turing Award\nlecture, Newell and Simon argued:\n\nComputer science is an empirical discipline. We would have called it\nan experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology,\nsome of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a\nnarrow stereotype of the experimental method. Nonetheless, they are\nexperiments. Each new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually\nconstructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for\nthe answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by\nall analytical and measurement means available (Newell and Simon 1975,\np. 114)\n\n\nSince Newell and Simon\u2019s Turing award lecture, it has been clear\nthat computer science can be understood as an empirical science but of\na special sort, and this is related to the nature of experiments in\ncomputing. Indeed, much current debate on the epistemological status\nof computer science concerns the problem of defining what kind of\nscience it is (Tedre 2011, Tedre 2015) and, in particular, the nature\nof experiments in computer science (Schiaffonati and Verdicchio 2014),\nthe nature, if any, of laws and theorems in computing (Hartmanis 1993;\nRombach and Seelish 2008), and the methodological relation between\ncomputer science and software engineering (Gruner 2011).\n",
