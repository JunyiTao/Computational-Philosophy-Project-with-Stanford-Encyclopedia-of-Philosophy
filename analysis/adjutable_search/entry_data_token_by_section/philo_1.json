    "main_text": "The Man and His Work || His works\n1.2 His works\n\nPhilo\u2019s work does not form a well-organized corpus. During\nPhilo\u2019s time, the work was larger than the corpus we now have.\nThe relation of Philo to the Hebrew exegetical traditions of his time\nis an important and controversial question. One of the major paradoxes\nfor his posterity is that his work was ignored by Jews and saved by\nChristians, some of whom thought that he was himself a Christian\n(Runia 2009). In 233 CE the entire corpus was brought to Caesarea, a\ncity that became the main center of its transmission, though some\npapyri suggest the circulation of at least some of his treatises in\nEgypt. The more or less generally accepted classification is that of\nMassebiau (1889), completed by Cohn (1899). It is divided into five\nprincipal categories:\n\nAllegorical commentaries (39 treatises)\nTwelve treatises of exposition of the law (12 treatises)\nQuestions and answers on Genesis and Exodus (6\ntreatises)\nFour historical and apologetic treatises (4 treatises)\nFive philosophical treatises\n\n\nNo definite chronology of the works was established until the very\nrecent book of Niehoff (2018). Philo gives very few hints regarding\nhis process of composition, offering only a few remarks about the\nstructure and divisions of his treatises. Regarding the strange fact\nthat these Greek treatises bear Latin titles, Monique Alexandre (1997)\nconducted a complete study in which she examines a complex\nphilological process from Antiquity to the nineteenth century through\nthe humanists of the Renaissance and their immediate successors.\n",
