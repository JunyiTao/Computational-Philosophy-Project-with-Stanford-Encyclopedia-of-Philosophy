Quite a different tradition seeks to give a satisfying\naxiomatic theory of truth. Granted we cannot retain all of classical\nlogic and all of our intuitive principles regarding truth, especially\nif we allow vicious self-reference. But maybe we can arrive at\nsatisfying axiom systems for truth, that, for example, maintain\nconsistency and classical logic, but give up only a little bit when it\ncomes to our intuitive principles concerning truth, such as the\nT-biconditionals (interpreted classically); or maintain consistency\nand all of the T-biconditionals, but give up only a little bit of\nclassical logic. Halbach 2011 comprehensively studies such axiomatic\ntheories (mainly those that retain classical logic), and Horsten 2011\nis in the same tradition. Both Chapter 14 of Halbach 2011 and Chapter\n8 of Horsten 2011 study the relationship between the Friedman-Sheard\ntheory FS and the revision semantics, with some interesting results.\nFor more work on axiomatic systems and the RTT, see Horsten et al\n2012.\n\nField 2008 makes an interesting contribution to axiomatic theorizing\nabout truth, even though most of the positive work in the book\nconsists of model building and is therefore semantics. In particular,\nField is interested in producing a theory as close to classical logic\nas possible, which retains all T-biconditionals (the conditional\nitself will be nonclassical) and which at the same time can express,\nin some sense, the claim that such and such a sentence is defective.\nField uses tools from multivalued logic, fixed-point semantics, and\nrevision theory to build models showing, in effect, that a very\nattractive axiomatic system is consistent. Field\u2019s construction\nis an intricate interplay between using fixed-point constructions for\nsuccessively interpreting T, and revision sequences for successively\ninterpreting the nonclassical conditional \u2014 the final\ninterpretation being determined by a sort of super-revision-theoretic\nprocess.\n\nThe connection between revision and Field\u2019s theory is explored\nfurther in Standefer 2015b and in Gupta and Standefer 2017.\n",
