According to this view, in\nother words, the best account we can give of the reasons we have for\nbelieving the results of computer simulation studies is to have trust\nin the practical skills and craft of the modelers that use them. \nA good example of this kind of account is (Hubig and Kaminski,\n2017). The epistemological goal of this kind of work is to\nidentify the locus of our trust in simulations in practical aspects of\nthe craft of modeling and simulation, rather than in any\nfeatures of the models themselves. (Resch et al, 2017) argue that\na good part of the reason we should trust simulations is not because of\nthe simulations themselves, but because of the interpretive artistry of\nthose who employ their art and skill to interpret simulation\noutputs. Symons and Alvarado (2019) are also critical of this\napproach, arguing that \u201cPart of the task of the epistemology of\ncomputer simulation is to explain the difference between the\ncontemporary scientist\u2019s position in relation to epistemically\nopaque computer simulations..\u201d (p.7) and the believers in a\nmechanical oracle\u2019s relation to their oracles.  Pragmatic\nand epistemic considerations, according to Symons and Alvarado,\nco-exist, and they are not possible competitors for the correct\nexplanation of our trust in simulations--the epistemic reasons are\nultimate what explain and ground the pragmatic ones. \n",
