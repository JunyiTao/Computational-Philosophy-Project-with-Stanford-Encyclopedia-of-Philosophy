    "main_text": "Conceptions of Authenticity || Sartre and de Beauvoir\n4. Recent Accounts of Authenticity\n\nIn the last three decades, authors like Taylor (1989, 1991, 1995,\n2007), Ferrara (1993; 1998), Jacob Golomb (1995), Guignon (2004, 2008)\nand Varga (2011a) have attempted to reconstruct authenticity by\nmaintaining that the justified criticism of self-indulgent forms of\nthe idea does not justify the total condemnation of the idea itself\n(see Taylor 1991: 56). Instead of abandoning the notion of\nauthenticity, they attempt to reconstruct it in a manner that leads\nneither to aestheticism nor to atomistic self-indulgence.\n\nIn The Ethics of Authenticity, and the more fully articulated\nSources of the Self, Taylor makes a case for retaining the\nconcept of authenticity (and the practices associated with it) on the\ngrounds that the original and undistorted idea of authenticity\ncontains an important element of self-transcendence (Taylor 1991: 15;\nAnderson 1995). Unsatisfied with the widespread criticism of\nauthenticity as an adequate ethical orientation, Taylor sets out to\nprove that authenticity does not necessarily lead to aestheticism or\nself-indulgence: the justified criticism of self-indulgent forms of\nthe ideal does not justify the complete condemnation of the ideal\nitself (Taylor 1991: 56). This would mean extricating aestheticism,\nsubjectivism, individualism, and self-indulgent interpretations of\nthis ideal from what Taylor (Ibid.: 15) holds to be an original\nunderstanding of that concept as achieving self-transcendence\n(Anderson 1995). Restoring an undistorted version, Taylor says, could\nguard against meaninglessness, which is one of the \u201cmalaises of\nmodernity\u201d that Taylor regards as tied to trivialized forms of\nthe culture of authenticity. Self-transcendence, which once was a\ncrucial element in the ideal of authenticity, is practically lost from\nthe contemporary version, giving rise to cultures of self-absorption,\nwhich ultimately deteriorate into the malaise of absurdity.\n\nAlready in Sources of the Self, Taylor draws attention to how\nmodernism gives birth to a new kind of inward turn that not only\nattempts to overcome the mechanistic conception of the self linked to\ndisengaged reason but also the Romantic ideal of a faultless alignment\nof inner nature and reason. Instead, for the modernists, a turn inward\ndid not mean a turn towards a self that needs articulation.\n\n\nOn the contrary, the turn inward may take us beyond the self as\nusually understood, to a fragmentation of experience which calls our\nordinary notions of identity into question. (Taylor 1989: 462)\n\n\nWhile in modernism, the turn inward still contained a\nself-transcending moment, the critical point where the ideal of\nauthenticity becomes flattened is when it becomes\n\u2018contaminated\u2019 by a certain form of\n\u2018self-determining freedom\u2019 that also contains elements of\ninwardness and unconventionality (Taylor 1991: 38). Self-determining\nfreedom\n\n\nis the idea that I am free when I decide for myself what concerns me,\nrather than being shaped by external influences. It is a standard of\nfreedom that obviously goes beyond what has been called negative\nliberty (being free to do what I want without interference by others)\nbecause that is compatible with one\u2019s being shaped and\ninfluenced by society and its laws of conformity. Instead,\nself-determining freedom demands that one break free of all such\nexternal impositions and decide for oneself alone. (Taylor 1991:\n27)\n\n\nNot only is self-determining freedom not a necessary part of\nauthenticity, it is also counterproductive because its\nself-centeredness flattens the meanings of lives and fragments\nidentities. For Taylor, the process of articulating an identity\ninvolves adopting a relationship to the good or to what is important,\nwhich is connected to one\u2019s membership in a language community\n(Taylor 1989: 34\u201335). As he clearly states, \u201cauthenticity\nis not the enemy of demands that emanate from beyond the self; it\npresupposes such demands\u201d (Taylor 1991: 41). It cannot be up to\nme to decide what is important, since this would be self-defeating.\nInstead, whatever is important for me must connect to an\ninter-subjective notion of the good, wherefrom a good part of its\nnormative force lastly emanates. In this sense, authenticity simply\nrequires maintaining bonds to collective questions of worth that point\nbeyond one\u2019s own preferences. Taylor wants to show that modes of\ncontemporary culture that opt for self-fulfillment without regard\n\n\n(a) to the demands of our ties with others, or (b) to demands of any\nkind emanating from something more or other than human desires or\naspirations are self-defeating, that they destroy the conditions for\nrealizing authenticity itself. (Taylor 1991: 35)\n\n\nThus, not only do we need the recognition of concrete others in order\nto form our identities, but we must also (critically) engage with a\ncommon vocabulary of shared value orientations. In other words, Taylor\npoints out that authenticity needs the appropriation of values that\nmake up our collective horizons.\n\nIn his Reflective Authenticity, Alessandro Ferrara also sets\nout to defend authenticity as an ideal, but in contrast to Taylor he\nis interested in the social and philosophical issues of the relation\nbetween authenticity and validity. According to Ferrara\u2019s\ndiagnosis, we are currently witnessing a profound transition that,\nbesides affecting cultures, values and norms, also touch on the\n\u201cfoundations of validity,\u201d thereby affecting the\n\u201cbedrock of the symbolic network through which we relate to\nreality and reproduce our life-forms\u201d (Ferrara 1998: 1). At the\ncore of this transformation is the reformulation of\n\u201cwell-being\u201d (eudaimonia) as the normative ideal\nof authenticity, which can be of help in reconstructing a contemporary\nunderstanding of normativity. For Ferrara, it can ground a new ideal\nof universal validity \u201cultimately linked with the model of\nexemplary uniqueness or enlightening singularity thus far associated\nwith \u2018aesthetics\u2019\u201d (Ferrara 1998: 10). Authenticity\nis then characterized by the \u201cself-congruency\u201d of an\nindividual, collective or symbolic identity (Ferrara 1998: 70), and is\nthought of as providing a new universal validity that does not build\non the generalizable but rather on the exemplary. Ferrara views\nSimmel\u2019s idea of an individual law as an instructive example of\nsuch an anti-generalizing universalism, and it is exactly this\ncharacteristic that makes it better suited to the pluralist contexts\nfaced by modern Western societies. More recently, Ferrara (2019) has\nargued that authenticity currently faces a \u201cdual paradox\u201d\nand is misconstrued by many critics advocating its deconstructionist\ndismissal.\n\nGolomb (1995) provides an informative historical overview of the\ngenesis and development of the concept of authenticity, paying\nattention to both literary and philosophical sources. While\ncontinuously reminding us of the inherently social dimension of\nauthenticity, one of the achievements here is the focus on boundary\nsituations where authenticity \u201cis best forged and\nrevealed\u201d (Ibid.: 201). Golomb takes a neutral position on the\nethical value of authenticity, maintaining that \u201cthere is no\nreason to suppose that it is any better or any more valuable to be\nauthentic than to act inauthentically\u201d (Ibid.: 202).\n\nGuignon (2004) explores both the philosophical roots of authenticity\nand its contemporary manifestations in popular culture. He\nthoughtfully criticizes pop-psychological literature that deals with\nthe authentic life by making recourse to the subdued \u2018inner\nchild\u2019. Since Rousseau, the dichotomy between authentic and\ninauthentic has often been interpreted akin to the distinction between\nchild and adult (Guignon 2004: 43). Like the inner child, the\nauthentic self is depicted as not yet corrupted by the pressures,\ncompetitiveness, and conformity of modern public life. Guignon draws\non the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Jung to remind us of less\nromanticized visions of the inner child. Additionally, Guignon (2004:\n151) aims to identify the manner in which authenticity can be\nunderstood as being at the same time a personal and a\n\u201cfundamentally and irreducibly\u201d social virtue.\nAuthenticity then involves reflectively discerning what is really\nworth pursuing in the social context in which the agent is situated\n(Ibid.: 155). If the ideal of authenticity is possible only in a free\nsociety with a solid foundation of established social virtues, it\nwould seem that trying to be authentic, if it is to be coherent, must\ninvolve a commitment to sustaining and nurturing the type of society\nin which such an ideal is possible. A reflection on the social\nembodiment of virtues therefore suggests that authenticity, like many\nother character ideals, carries with it an obligation to contribute to\nthe maintenance and well-being of a particular type of social\norganization and way of life (Guignon 2008: 288; 2004: 161). On the\nother hand, Guignon (2004, 2008) argues that in a democratic society,\nin which the authority of government\u2014in setting the political\ncourse\u2014stems from the consent of the governed, there is good\nreason to promote virtues like authenticity that sustain such an\norganization of government. To be authentic is to be clear about\none\u2019s own most basic feelings, desires and convictions, and to\nopenly express one\u2019s stance in the public arena. But that\ncapacity is precisely the character trait that is needed in order to\nbe an effective member of a democratic society (Guignon 2008:\n288).\n\nVarga (2011a) shares the fundamental assumption that authenticity has\na certain potential (and therefore deserves to be reformulated), but\nhe also thinks that it could be used for a critical inquiry into the\npractices of the self in contemporary life. By way of an analysis of\nself-help and self-management literature, Varga detects a\n\u201cparadoxical transformation:\u201d the ideal of authenticity\nthat once provided an antidote to hierarchical institutions and\nrequirements of capitalism, now seems to function both as an\ninstitutionalized demand towards subjects to match the systemic\ndemands of contemporary capitalism and as a factor in the economic\nutilization of subjective capacities. Varga argues that it is in\n\u201cexistential\u201d choices that we express who we are, and that\nthese have a complex phenomenology characterized by a sense of\nnecessity. In such choices, described as \u201calternativeless\nchoices\u201d, we articulate who we are, bringing into reality some\ntacit intuitions that often only take on a gestalt-like formation. In\nthese cases, we both discover who we are \u201con the inside\u201d,\nand actively constitute ourselves. Varga\u2019s examination of the\nstructure of our commitments culminates in the claim that the internal\nstructure of our commitments commits us to more than what we happen to\ncare about. In many cases it may actually commit us to publicly\nintelligible values that we take our commitments to embody\u2014an\naspect that may constrain the manner of our practical deliberation and\nthe way in which we can pursue our commitments (Varga 2011a,b).\n\nAlong similar lines, Bauer (2017) defends authenticity as an ethical\nideal, arguing that the ideal should understood as the combination of\nthe ideal of expressing one\u2019s individual personality and the\nideal of being an autonomous and morally responsible person. Others\nhave argued that authenticity might require more than living in accord\nwith commitments that one wholeheartedly endorses. For example, Rings\n(2017) highlights an epistemic criterion. The point is that the\ncommitments in question have to be chosen in light of an\nacknowledgment of facts concerning one\u2019s personal history and\npresent context. Thus, self-knowledge might matter more than hitherto\nrecognized, even if the self-relation most pertinent to authenticity\nis not primarily of an epistemic nature. \n",
