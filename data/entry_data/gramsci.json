    "preamble": "\n\nAntonio Gramsci (1891\u20131937) has been enormously influential as a\nMarxist theorist of cultural and political domination in\n\u201cdeveloped\u201d capitalism. However, his career was that of a\nradical journalist and revolutionary organizer, not a professional\nphilosopher. Gramsci was a socialist activist, cultural commentator\nand, later, communist party leader in Italy. Most of his writings are\nconcerned with assessing the immediate political situation and,\nparticularly, the prospects for revolution in interwar Italy.\nNonetheless, Gramsci was conversant with philosophical currents of the\ntime\u2014especially Italian neo-idealism, native intellectual and\npolitical traditions dating back to Machiavelli, and the major\ncurrents of Marxist thought. It was only with his imprisonment by the\nFascist authorities that he produced his most well-known and\nphilosophically rich texts: the Prison Notebooks. The\ninsights therein account for much of his posthumous recognition.\n\nIn the Notebooks, Gramsci undertook a series of historical\nand theoretical reflections on the conditions for revolution in modern\nstates\u2014such as Italy\u2019s\u2014where degrees of popular\nconsent had been achieved. He employed the concept\n\u201chegemony\u201d to describe a process of \u201cintellectual\nand moral leadership\u201d that embedded a ruling class across\nsociety. He rejected the economic determinism of classical Marxism in\nfavor of a nuanced political analysis attuned to contingent variation\nin historical circumstance. Gramsci brought Marxism into dialogue with\nneo-idealist insights into practical subjectivity and he sketched a\nrevolutionary strategy aimed at preparing a new collective identity.\nAlthough fragmentary and open to contrasting emphases, the\nNotebooks set out a radical philosophy of politics that has\nbeen of enduring value to critical political and cultural theory.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Political Activity\n1.1 Sardinia (1891\u20131911)\n\nAntonio Francesco Gramsci was born on 22 January 1891 in Ales,\nSardinia to a middle-class family of Albanian descent. Located in\nItaly\u2019s southern Mezzogiorno, the island of Sardinia\nshared the region\u2019s arid landscape, widespread poverty, and\nfragile social hierarchies. Gramsci was the fifth of seven children\nborn to Giuseppina (n\u00e9e Marcia) and Francesco Gramsci and spent\nhis early childhood near Cagliari, where his family had moved in 1897.\nIn infancy he developed Pott\u2019s Disease, a spinal form of\ntuberculosis that was not properly treated and, as a result, he grew\nup with a \u201chunched\u201d back. He suffered frequent health\nproblems throughout the rest of his life (Davidson 1977:\n22\u201323).\n\nHis father, a local civil servant, was suspended from his job in 1898\non politically motivated charges of corruption (he had supported an\nopposition candidate in local elections) and subsequently sentenced to\nfive years in prison (Davidson 1977: 23\u201325). This brought years\nof terrible hardship for the family, who relocated to the town of\nGhilarza. In 1903 the young Antonio\u2014known as\n\u201cNino\u201d\u2014even suspended his schooling to support his\nfamily by working in a Land Registry office. On his return to\neducation two years later, following his father\u2019s release, he\nprogressed well. A reserved character but an avid reader with a strong\nwill, he entered high school in Cagliari, where he lived with his\nelder brother, Gennaro. Gennaro introduced him to socialist\nliterature, and he began to read Italian critics such as Gaetano\nSalvemini, Giuseppe Prezzolini, and Benedetto Croce, as well as Karl\nMarx. Gramsci shared many Sardinians\u2019 deep resentment at the\nshortcomings of the \u201cliberal\u201d state since its unification\nin the nineteenth century, especially its protectionist policies,\nwhich contributed to the South\u2019s cultural and economic\nunderdevelopment.\n\nIn 1911 Gramsci won a monthly stipend to support his studies at the\nCarlo Alberto College at the University of Turin in the northern\nregion of Piedmont.\n1.2 Turin (1911\u20131922)\n\nTurin contrasted radically with Gramsci\u2019s southern upbringing:\nit was an advanced industrial city, dominated by the FIAT car\nfactories and connected to wider European cultures. For some years,\nGramsci endured the precarious existence of an impoverished student;\nhis education was frequently interrupted by poverty, nervous\nexhaustion, and ill-health. At university he studied philology, or\nlinguistics, and worked under the guidance of the socio-linguist\nProfessor Matteo Bartoli, who was drawn to Gramsci\u2019s native\nfamiliarity with Sardinian dialect (see Ives 2004). Bartoli envisaged\nGramsci becoming a linguist. Studying in the Humanities,\nGramsci\u2019s own ambitions were, originally, to train as a teacher.\nAt university, he contributed to reviews with articles on Futurism\n(SCW: 46\u201349).\n\nGramsci did not formally complete his university studies. He abandoned\neducation in 1915 and became a full-time journalist and socialist\nactivist. Joining the Italian Socialist Party (Partito socialista\nitaliano, or PSI) in 1913, he became involved in worker\u2019s\neducation. Two years later, he was offered a position as a journalist\nfor the Turin edition of the PSI daily newspaper, Avanti!\nAlready a contributor to the weekly Il Grido del Popolo\n(\u201cThe People\u2019s Cry\u201d), he accepted the offer and\nbegan writing political commentaries and theatre reviews under a\nregular column, titled \u201cSotto la Mole\u201d (\u201cIn the\nshadow of the Mole Antoniella\u201d, a landmark in Turin, designed\noriginally as a synagogue, near to where Gramsci lodged). In 1917, he\nco-published a single issue socialist cultural review, aimed at young\nsocialists, entitled La Citt\u00e0 futura (\u201cCity of\nthe Future\u201d).\n\nThe prospect of world war deeply split the Italian public and\npolitical parties into \u201cinterventionists\u201d and\n\u201cneutralists\u201d. The firebrand revolutionary socialist,\nBenito Mussolini, came out for intervention against the PSI\u2019s\nofficial neutrality. Entering the war, he hoped, would initiate a\nwider collapse of the liberal order and ignite social revolution.\nMussolini was eventually forced out of the party. The young Gramsci\nwas also tempted by that stance and declared his preference not for\nintervention but for an \u201cactive neutrality\u201d that took the\nwar as a moment to prepare for radical transformation (SPWI:\n6\u20139). For this milder resistance to the party\u2019s formal\nposition, he was thereafter treated with some suspicion by fellow\nsocialists.\n\nInspired by the Russian Revolutions of February and October 1917,\nGramsci aligned himself with the \u201cintransigent\nrevolutionary\u201d faction in the PSI, urging it to pursue its\n\u201cmaximalist\u201d program of radical transformation. He became\nsecretary of the executive committee of the Turin socialists and, in\nthe same year, took up the role of editor of Il Grido del\nPopolo. In December 1917 he published \u201cThe Revolution\nAgainst Capital\u201d in Avanti!, and used Il\nGrido to publicize news and commentary on events in Russia,\nincluding texts by Lenin and Trotsky (SPWI: 34\u20137). He made\nvarious efforts to organize a local proletarian cultural association\nto galvanize political and economic struggles into a general\nrevolutionary project, although they did not take off.\n\nAfter the war Gramsci joined with university and socialist friends to\nfound and edit a new review, L\u2019Ordine Nuovo (\u201cThe\nNew Order\u201d). Intended, initially, as a journal of\n\u201csocialist culture\u201d it became a medium to discuss the\nindustrial factory struggles then underway in Turin. In Ordine\nNuovo, Gramsci presented a theory of a workers\u2019 state\ninspired by the efforts at self-management by skilled workers (see\nSPWI: 65\u2013124). Spurred on by the workers\u2019 disputes and\nfactory occupations across the years 1919 and 1920, he published\nwritings by syndicalist thinkers, participated in debates, and set out\nhis own views on the potential for the factories to become the locus\nof proletarian state institutions (see Clark 1977).\n\nAfter the occupations ended in defeat, Gramsci aligned with the\ncommunist faction of the PSI, calling for the party to be renewed as a\nrevolutionary organization. In January 1921 in Livorno, the communists\nformally split from the PSI and established the Communist Party of\nItaly (Partito comunista d\u2019Italia or PCd\u2019I). Led\nby the militant, Amadeo Bordiga, the new party required rigid\ndiscipline and had firm ideological roots in Marxist doctrine. Gramsci\nwas elected to its central committee and Ordine Nuovo was\ntransformed into the party\u2019s daily paper.\n\nThe PCd\u2019I remained too small to have any serious impact on\nevents. Despite substantial success in the 1919 elections, the now\ndivided left were increasingly outwitted by the maneuverings of\nMussolini, and his \u201cfascist\u201d movement. Throughout 1921 and\n1922, fascist \u201csquads\u201d terrorized trade unions across the\nnorth of Italy, burning down their offices and sending armed gangs to\nviolently assault workers and peasants. In October 1922, Mussolini was\ninvited by the King to lead a coalition government, supported by\nconservative politicians increasingly alarmed at the intensity of\nsocial disorder and the prospect of a workers\u2019 revolution.\n1.3 Moscow (1922\u20131923)\n\nIn June 1922 Gramsci was dispatched to Russia as the PCd\u2019I\ndelegate to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (or\n\u201cComintern\u201d) to participate in its Moscow conference.\nExhausted by the recent years of frenetic activity, he soon booked\ninto a sanatorium to recover his health. During that sojourn, he met\nJulija Schucht who in the next year became his wife and, later, mother\nto his two sons.\n\nIn Moscow, Gramsci was absorbed into the bureaucratic complexities of\ninternational communist politics, negotiating with the Comintern over\nthe PCd\u2019I\u2019s relations to other left parties. Events in\nboth Russia and Italy compelled Gramsci to reconsider his position on\nparty tactics. In November, the fourth congress of the Comintern\nagreed that the PCd\u2019I should fuse with the PSI (which, by then,\nhad expelled its own reformists and renewed its links to the\nInternational). In truth, there was little enthusiasm among Italian\ncommunists for this option and no real opportunity after Mussolini had\ntaken power. Leading members of each party (including Bordiga) were\nbeing persecuted by the regime and detained by the police. From\nprison, Bordiga circulated a draft manifesto openly rejecting the\npolicy of fusion, but Gramsci\u2014increasingly concerned at\nBordiga\u2019s open divergence from the Comintern\u2014refused to\nsign it, arguing later that he had \u201ca different conception of\nthe Party\u201d (GTW: 197).\n1.4 Vienna and Rome (1923\u20131926)\n\nGramsci relocated to Vienna in late 1923 to open the\nPCd\u2019I\u2019s Foreign Bureau and maintain closer links with\nevents in Italy. There he began to articulate a conception of party\ntactics that contrasted with Bordiga\u2019s sectarian\ninclinations\u2014under which, Gramsci claimed, \u201cWe detach\nourselves from the masses\u201d (GTW: 159)\u2014and began organizing\na new leading group with his comrades from Turin. Gramsci sought a\nUnited Front policy with other radical organizations and parties in\nItaly to maintain a presence across the country\u2014particularly in\nthe South\u2014rather than simply await a crisis to hand leadership\nto the party. This view brought him closer to the policy of the\nComintern. In Vienna he initiated the publication of a new daily party\npaper, L\u2019Unit\u00e0 (\u201cUnity\u201d), aimed at\nan inclusive audience of \u201cworkers and peasants\u201d.\n\nGramsci was elected in April 1924 (in his absence) to the Italian\nParliament, which granted him immunity from prosecution. He returned\nto Italy in May and took part in the PCd\u2019I\u2019s clandestine\nconference at Como. There he made clear his tactical differences with\nBordiga, although the majority remained aligned to Bordiga\u2019s\nposition. In the summer Gramsci took over the role of party General\nSecretary (GTW: 321). The political situation in Italy continued to\nintensify following the abduction and murder by fascist thugs of the\nsocialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti and the subsequent withdrawal in\nprotest of opposition parties from Parliament. Initially, public\nrevulsion at the murder threatened to destabilize the regime but the\nopposition gradually crumbled, and police harassment of anti-fascists\ncontinued.\n\nIn January 1926 the PCd\u2019I held its third congress in Lyons,\nFrance. Gramsci\u2019s conception of party tactics finally won\nsubstantial support from the membership. The so-called \u201cLyons\nTheses\u201d, co-written by Gramsci and Togliatti, underscored the\nurgency of adapting strategy to national conditions in Italy. With its\npartial capitalist development, extensive agrarian sector, and the\nprecarious \u201ccompromise\u201d between the northern bourgeoisie\nand southern big landowners, the unified state lacked a substantial\npopular base (see SPWII: 340\u201375). Fascism, they argued, merely\npreserved the rule of these two classes by armed force and with petty\nbourgeois support. The PCd\u2019I, they continued, therefore needed\nto build mass support among both workers and peasants so\nthat, when a revolutionary situation eventually returned, it could\nexercise effective leadership. In the meantime, Gramsci underscored\nthe necessity of a united front with other democratic parties (SPWII:\n406\u20137).\n\nConcerned at the growing divisions within the Soviet leadership\nbetween Stalin and Trotsky, Gramsci wrote a letter in October 1926\nunderlining the danger this split posed to Russia\u2019s leading role\nin the communist movement (GTW: 369\u201376). However, Togliatti, who\nwas entrusted to pass on the letter to the Russian Central Committee,\ndid not deliver it for fear of causing greater friction.\n\nGramsci himself was now increasingly in danger in Italy where, despite\nformal immunity, the regime increased its harassment of opposition\nparties as it transitioned into a full authoritarian dictatorship. On\n8 November 1926, Gramsci was arrested by the authorities and placed in\nprison.\n1.5 Prison (1926\u20131937)\n\nTo await trial Gramsci was transferred from Rome, via Naples and\nSicily, to the island of Ustica, where he was confined in a private\nhouse with other communists (including Bordiga). In January 1927 he\nwas conveyed to Milan, where he was placed in isolation and underwent\ninterrogation. Permitted to receive books and write two letters a\nweek, Gramsci indicated some potential writing projects in\ncorrespondence to his sister-in-law, Tatiana Schucht, who remained in\nItaly during his imprisonment and became a vital source of support. He\nsuggested that he would like to write something \u201cfrom a\n\u2018disinterested\u2019 standpoint, f\u00fcr ewig\u201d\n(\u201cfor eternity\u201d, borrowing a phrase from Goethe) (GPL:\n45). He was visited by his Turin friend, Piero Sraffa (later a\nwell-known Cambridge University economist), who helped supply reading\nmaterials and acted as an interlocutor with Togliatti.\n\nEventually, in May 1928, a special tribunal was held in Rome. Gramsci\nwas sentenced to 20 years, 4 months and 5 days in prison (but in 1932\nthe sentence was commuted to 12 years). The prosecutor had remarked\n\u201cWe must stop this brain from functioning for twenty\nyears\u201d (PPW: xxviii). Already in fragile health, he was\ntransferred to the prison in Turi di Bari, in the region of Apulia.\nLater\u2014and despite the prosecutor\u2014he was granted a cell of\nhis own and permission to read and write. The first of his\nNotebooks is dated 8 February 1929.\n\nLife in prison was not easy. Gramsci\u2019s health continued to\ndeteriorate\u2014he was badly neglected by the prison\nauthorities\u2014and he suffered psychologically from his isolation.\nYet was he not entirely cut off from events outside. He received\nvisits from Tatiana and from his brothers, who (in addition to\nservicing his study needs and advocating on his behalf for medical\ntreatment) passed on news concerning the PCd\u2019I and the Russian\nleadership. So, at least initially, he was not wholly unaware of\nchanging policies and strategic decisions. The Comintern\u2019s\nswitch in policy from 1928\u2014the so-called \u201cThird\nPeriod\u201d: abandoning the united front tactic in favor of class\ninsurrection, on the assumption that a crisis in capitalism was\nimminent, denouncing potential socialist and social democratic parties\nas \u201csocial fascists\u201d\u2014contrasted with Gramsci\u2019s\nposition supporting alliances. Gramsci\u2019s criticism of this new\npolicy brought ostracism from other communist prisoners (Spriano 1977\n[1979: 70\u20131]).\n\nGramsci\u2019s correspondence (like his Notebooks) was read\nby the prison authorities and subject to censorship, meaning that\npolitical references to outside events had to be muted or entirely\nabsent. Nonetheless, he kept in regular contact with his wife and\nchildren (one of whom he had never met), and his mother. His letters\noffer fascinating insight into his intellectual interests, personal\nfeelings, and health during incarceration (see GPL). He wrote stories\nfor his young sons and reminisced about his own childhood in Sardinia.\nInitially, with other party members in the prison, he took part in\nreading groups and political conversations. However, his declining\nhealth over the years encouraged supporters to request his release or\ntransfer to an infirmary. Gramsci refused to agree to his own\nconditional release if that meant renouncing all political\nactivity.\n\nIn 1933 he was finally moved to a clinic in Formia. He continued to\nwrite but less productively and, after 1935, mostly correspondence. At\nFormia he eventually applied for and was granted conditional freedom\n(which enabled him to leave the grounds in the company of Tatiana). In\nAugust 1935 he moved to the \u201cQuisisana\u201d sanatorium in Rome\nwhere he received visits from Sraffa and from his brothers, and where\nin April 1937 his sentence finally expired. By that time, he was\ngravely ill. On the evening of 25 April 1937, Gramsci suffered a\ncerebral hemorrhage. He died in the early hours of 27 April.\n\nGramsci\u2019s funeral was held the next day and his ashes were kept\nlocally until after the war, when they were moved to the English\nCemetery in Rome, where his grave remains. Tatiana retrieved\nGramsci\u2019s thirty-three handwritten Notebooks; these\nwere secured secretly in a bank until the following year when they\nwere smuggled to Moscow and passed on to the PCd\u2019I (Spriano 1977\n[1979: 133\u201334]).\n2. Pre-Prison Journalism and Political Writings\n\nGramsci\u2019s overt \u201cphilosophical\u201d references in his\nwritings prior to the Notebooks are sporadic and bound\nclosely to his responses to wider events. He wrote as a committed\nsocialist and revolutionary critic, albeit as an intellectual\nskeptical of prevailing orthodoxies (influenced, arguably, by his\nsouthern upbringing which made him something of an\n\u201coutsider\u201d to mainstream progressive opinion). Like many\nItalian commentators, he shared the view that the liberal\nstate\u2019s fundamental shortcoming consisted in a failure to build\npopular and inclusive governing institutions. The task remained,\ntherefore, \u201cto make Italians\u201d (fare gli italiani)\nas one critic put it, that is, to find a model of association to\nculturally integrate citizens (see Bellamy 1987). This general problem\ninforms Gramsci\u2019s pre-prison writings as well as his later\naccount of hegemony (see Bellamy & Schecter 1993).\n\nThe period up to Gramsci\u2019s arrest was a dramatically evolving\ncontext of social and political crisis in Italy and across Europe\ngenerally. Gramsci earned local recognition during and after the war\nas a biting, \u201cserious\u201d radical journalist. He was\nacerbically critical of Italy\u2019s ruling elite and the\nbourgeoisie\u2019s shallow moral sensibilities. For example, in 1918\nhe denounced the widespread use of cocaine as \u201can index of\nbourgeois progress\u201d and bemoaned the absence, demonstrated by\nthe Italian card game scopone, of a \u201cconcept of\n\u2018fair play\u2019\u201d proper to developed capitalist\nsocieties (see PPW: 72, 74). From the early 1920s, by contrast, his\naudience was primarily party members, and his writing was steeped in\nthe technical language of revolutionary communist analysis.\n\nDespite this shifting register, several related philosophical themes\nand influences can be discerned that characterized his thinking\nthroughout his pre-prison activities. These can be summarized as:\n\na \u201chumanist\u201d opposition to scientific positivism and\nmaterialist determinism for its neglect of the subjective dimension to\nhuman action. Here he was influenced by neo-idealist philosophers and\ncritics of the classical Marxist tradition, primarily Benedetto\nCroce;\na radical insistence on the force of subjectively motivated\ncollective action, expressed as the formation of a unified moral will.\nThe most popular source of this view in Italy was the revolutionary\nsyndicalist thinker, Georges Sorel; and\na preference for collective self-liberation and a rejection of\nauthoritarian, elitist, or artificially imposed systems of rule. Such\nviews were common among radical critics of the liberal state and its\nprotectionist policies, such as the socialist reformer and analyst of\nsouthern underdevelopment, Gaetano Salvemini.\n\n\nThese themes and influences combined in Gramsci\u2019s criticism of\nthe liberal political class and his promotion of socialism. Three\nsequential phases of his pre-prison thinking can be distinguished: his\nearly cultural socialism\n (\u00a72.1);\n his post-war theory of the factory-based workers\u2019 state\n (\u00a72.2);\n and his later, developing reflections on communist party strategy\n (\u00a72.3).\n2.1 Cultural Socialism\n\nGramsci\u2019s early writing was informed by the influential critical\nframework of the neo-Hegelian philosopher Benedetto Croce. Croce had\ndenounced scientific positivism\u2014prevalent among social\nscientists and European Marxists\u2014for its abstract, ahistorical\nreasoning and emphasis on material \u201ccauses\u201d in social\nchange. Positivism neglected the historically particular and\npractically creative dimension of \u201cspirit\u201d (or\nconsciousness) which, beyond any political program, motivated all\nsocial and cultural transformation. Croce invited a view of\nItaly\u2019s political failings as the absence of a robust, unifying\nculture\u2014a secular civic faith\u2014rather than economic\nunderdevelopment as such (see Croce 1914). He inspired numerous\n\u201caesthetic\u201d critics of the liberal state to understand\nsocio-political improvement as inseparable from free artistic\nself-creation, the assertion of moral will, and the cultivation of a\nshared \u201cinner\u201d sensibility.\n\nGramsci admitted later to having been \u201ctendentially somewhat\nCrocean\u201d in his early writing (FSPN: 355). For example, he\nendorsed the acquisition by workers of a \u201cfaith\u201d based on\nintellectual self-discipline and independence of thought, severely\ncastigating any tendency to passive \u201cindifference\u201d (SPWI:\n17\u201318). Echoing Sorel, whose writings Croce had championed, he\npresented socialism not as the outcome of historical\n\u201claws\u201d but as \u201can integral vision of life\u201d,\nthe adoption of an invigorating, moral consciousness to supplant the\nfailed bourgeois order (SCW: 22). In 1917 he welcomed the Russian\nRevolution as the \u201crevolution against Capital\u201d, viewing it\nnot as proof of Marx\u2019s economic theories but as evidence of the\npractical force of a collective will (SPWI: 34\u20137). Later, in\n1918, Gramsci offered his own idealist version of Marx, imagined as\n\u201ca master of moral and spiritual life\u201d teaching the\nproletariat to become consciously aware of \u201cits power and\nmission\u201d in history (PPW: 57, 56).\n\nThis somewhat ascetic, pedagogic humanism distinguished the young\nGramsci from other socialists who appealed to historical progress or\ninvested in the slow, practical advance of trade unionism and\napplication of scientific reason. Gramsci regarded such appeals as\nrooted in an elitist attitude aimed at bringing reform to the masses\nfrom on-high. Instead, he endorsed a grass-roots self-organization\nthat underscored the integrity and moral autonomy of a uniquely\nproletarian worldview. This placed him closer to other radical critics\nof the PSI, such as anarchists and syndicalists who also looked to a\nlibertarian politics \u201cfrom below\u201d (see Levy 1999).\n2.2 The Factory State\n\nThe first original initiative for which Gramsci became known was his\ntheory of factory-based democracy, which he promoted during the\nso-called biennio rosso\u2014or \u201ctwo red\nyears\u201d\u2014of 1919\u20131920.\n\nInspired by the industrial unrest and factory occupations in Turin and\nbeyond, as well as by the new \u201csoviets\u201d in Russia, Gramsci\npublished in Ordine Nuovo various opinions and resources on\nthe topic of a nascent workers\u2019 state (see SPWI: 65\u2013124).\nHis contributions took his earlier humanism in a more concrete,\npractical direction. Efforts by workers to wrest the management of\nproduction from industrialists\u2014in part via \u201cfactory\ncouncils\u201d, formerly grievance committees\u2014instantiated, for\nhim, an initiative rooted in actual history, where a new moral\ncommunity was \u201cspontaneously\u201d expressing its own\nindependent identity beyond the limits of trade unionism. Focused on\nthe practical planning and control of material production, he claimed,\nthe occupying workers were not responding passively to abstract\nhistorical laws or to the directions of their leaders but, rather,\nacting as agents of their own self-creation.\n\nGramsci sketched a model of industrial democracy in which a new type\nof state, based inside the factories, would replace the discredited\nparliamentary regime. Free trade capitalism was exhausted, and trade\nunion organization had now reached its limit, he argued. Emerging\norganically inside the factories were\n\n\ninstitutions which will replace the person of the capitalist in his\nadministrative functions and his industrial power, and so achieve the\nautonomy of the producer in the factory. (SPWI: 77)\n\n\nRather than administer over isolated citizens by separating public\nauthority from everyday life\u2014as under liberalism\u2014the\nfactory instantiated a new type of polity formed around the collective\nmaterial needs of production (see Schecter 1991). Gramsci envisaged a\nparticipatory system of factory councils functioning in a hierarchical\ndemocratic system through which workers would relay and manage the\npractical needs of national life. Authority would be reconciled to\nliberty, not opposed to it, as under liberalism. The atomistic\nindividual would give way to the \u201cproducer\u201d, an individual\nalready psychologically and organizationally oriented to the\ncollective through its role in the labor process (SPWI:\n110\u201311).\n\nGramsci envisaged a system in which a communal identity had priority\nover individual initiative. His was an \u201corganic\u201d model of\nstate in which all parts related to the primary needs of the whole.\nThis was a potentially illiberal system that assumed substantive moral\nagreement among workers (see Sbarberi 1986). Some see here the\ninfluence of the neo-idealist (and soon fascist) philosopher, Giovanni\nGentile. His radical philosophy of \u201cactualism\u201d\u2014in\nwhich the subject\u2019s inner conscience creates its own unified\nworld and community\u2014supported the idea of the \u201cethical\nstate\u201d (stato etico) in which public authority and\nindividual freedom, coercion and consent, were essentially\nindistinguishable (Gentile 1919; see also Schecter 1990). Such\nanti-liberal sentiments were common in the wake of the war and chimed\nwith widespread public disenchantment with elite-led parliamentary\npolitics.\n2.3 Communist Party Strategy\n\nBy the end of the occupations in 1920, Gramsci had already begun to\nshift away from advocating workers\u2019 self-liberation. For him,\nthe complete absence of political leadership from the PSI had\nundermined the occupations\u2019 revolutionary potential. With the\nformation of the PCd\u2019I, he committed to a hierarchical,\ncentralized leadership and strict ideological discipline via a\nBolshevik model of the revolutionary party. This new position was,\narguably, less a wholesale volte face than a realization that\nthe PSI was culturally and organizationally incapable of responding to\nthe situation. Indeed, his understanding of the party\u2019s role\ncontinued to evolve thereafter. Nonetheless, his thinking from here\nonwards remained within a \u201cLeninist\u201d frame of reference\nconcerning revolutionary leadership, tactics, and organization.\n\nWhat is notable about Gramsci\u2019s writings on party strategy in\nthe period 1921\u201326 is not that they offer a coherent or novel\npolitical theory but, rather, that they show he was developing an\nindependent position that echoed fragments of his earlier thinking.\nThis involved: the rejection of \u201cformalistic\u201d reasoning\nthat neglected specific historical conditions; attention to the\nItalian social structure and the distinctive, cultural-political role\nof \u201cintellectuals\u201d; and the necessity of a mass-based\nparty that incorporated the southern peasantry. These topics were\ncentral points of reference in Gramsci\u2019s mature thinking about\nhegemony in the Notebooks.\n\nFor Gramsci, the critique of formalism underscored his growing concern\nthat the new party wasn\u2019t reading the \u201cobjective\nsituation\u201d but, rather, imposing a rigid view\n\u201cdeduced\u201d from abstract principle (SPWII: 360). The\nsurprising success of fascism in mobilizing part of the populace\nagainst the proletariat revealed just how intellectually and\npolitically unprepared communists had been. Gramsci now began to\nunderline the view that the received model of revolution\u2014a\nviolent seizure of power in the midst of a catastrophic\ncrisis\u2014needed to be adapted to conditions that had not applied\nin Russia. As he noted in September 1926:\n\n\nin the advanced capitalist countries, the ruling class possesses\npolitical and organizational reserves which it did not possess, for\ninstance, in Russia. (SPWII: 408)\n\n\nEconomic crises did not lead automatically to political instability\nbecause forces could be found to support the regime. In peripheral\nstates like Italy\u2019s, he observed, \u201ca broad stratum of\nintermediary classes\u201d\u2014middle classes of various\nkinds\u2014influenced the proletariat and the peasantry, steering\nthem away from revolution.\n\nIn his notes on the \u201cSouthern Question\u201d, written just\nprior to his arrest, Gramsci also explored the neglected problem of\nItaly\u2019s South, which he described as \u201ca great social\ndisintegration\u201d (SPWII: 454). He noted the influence of southern\nintellectuals, such as Benedetto Croce and Giustino Fortunato, in\nideologically legitimating the liberal regime. Croce, especially, had\nperformed a \u201cnational function\u201d by endorsing liberalism,\nhelping to prevent radical southern intellectuals from joining with\npeasants in opposition to the conservative agrarian bloc. Although he\nbelieved it unlikely in the short term, Gramsci argued the PCd\u2019I\nneeded to develop its own supporting intellectuals if it was to\nundertake an inclusive national strategy to overcome the agrarian\nbloc.\n\nEven within the constrained horizons of communist politics, then,\nGramsci was beginning to pose the question of revolution on a\ndifferent plane than others in the movement. The unplanned\ninterruption brought by his arrest and imprisonment permitted him to\nexplore many of these issues in much greater depth.\n3. Prison Writings\n\nGramsci\u2019s Prison Notebooks (or Quaderni del\ncarcere) comprise around three thousand pages of thematically\norganized essays, observations and comments, written between 1929 and\n1935 (see QC). A number of his notes were revised over time, which\nindicates they were not written randomly but conformed, in part, to a\nplan. Recent research offers some clue as to the logic and chronology\nof their drafting (see Francioni 1984). Nonetheless, the\nNotebooks were not written for publication and, as a whole,\nthey remain fragmentary with no explicit guide as to how, or in even\nwhat order, the contents might be read.\n\nIn his earliest letters from detention, Gramsci indicated various\nthemes that he hoped to explore, including Italian intellectuals,\ncomparative linguistics, the plays of Pirandello, newspapers and other\nforms of \u201cpopular literature\u201d (GPL: 45\u20136). Later he\nlisted more topics\u2014including historiography, the development of\nthe Italian bourgeoisie, the southern question, common sense, and\nfolklore.\n\nThese cultural and historical headings may appear uncontroversial. But\nthey permitted Gramsci to develop his wider thoughts on the practical\nand intellectual problems that had preoccupied him prior to his\narrest. That included: historical features of the Italian state;\ntheoretical concepts for analyzing the cultural and political\nconditions of class domination; and the organizing principles and\ncharacter of a revolutionary strategy. Freed from the immediate\nconstraints of tactical decisions and their repercussions, Gramsci\ndrew on his humanistic training to extend and deepen his understanding\nof these problems (see Schwarzmantel 2015).\n3.1 Hegemony\n\nThe concept often regarded as the locus of innovation in the\nNotebooks\u2014and hence their philosophical\nlinchpin\u2014is \u201chegemony\u201d (egemonia),\nsignifying both leadership and domination.\n\nHegemony had been a common term in debates among Russian Marxists and\nusually described the leading (or \u201chegemonic\u201d) role of the\nworking class over its allies in a political coalition. But it had\nalso been employed by Italian political thinkers in the nineteenth\ncentury to imagine gradually building consent across the nation for\nthe new state\u2014\u201cmaking Italians\u201d\u2014rather than\nrelying exclusively on the exercise of force. Gramsci fused these\nmeanings to present hegemony as the general hypothesis that a social\nclass aims to achieve consensual domination for its rule by\nprogressively expanding its leadership across society (see Femia\n1981).\n\nThis idea\u2014with its potential for variation in empirical focus\nand application\u2014was developed across different notes and topics,\nsometimes as a methodological device to analyze historical situations,\nat other times alongside different concepts to make strategic\nobservations. But it also functioned more broadly as a philosophical\nhorizon highlighting the inseparability of thought and action,\nsignaling that all intellectual enquiries were unavoidably implicated\nin the formation of an integral \u201cway of life\u201d. Focusing on\nhegemony permits us to appreciate the Notebooks as a unified\nintellectual project, despite their disparate themes and contrasting\naccents.\n\nThe major themes of Gramsci\u2019s ideas concerning hegemony are\nexplored below, starting with his \u201csociological\u201d\nobservations on the state, intellectuals, and ideology\n (\u00a73.2\u20134),\n and then looking at his theoretical reconstruction of Marxist\nphilosophy\n (\u00a73.5),\n and his observations concerning the revolutionary party\n (\u00a73.6).\n3.2 State and Civil Society\n\nGramsci\u2019s discussion of hegemony hinged, in part, on the\nempirical observation that capitalist rule in developed western\nstates, increasingly, is founded on the generation of consent across\ncivil society, not solely on the deployment of coercion via the army,\npolice or law courts.\n\nExpanding on his suggestion from 1926 (see\n \u00a72.3\n above) that the ruling class had available to it \u201cpolitical and\norganizational reserves\u201d, Gramsci now argued that modern states\nsince the mid-nineteenth century have tended to cultivate consensual\nsupport\u2014or hegemony\u2014across civil society such that\ncoercion, or its threat, was no longer the primary form of rule,\nexcept in \u201cmoments of crisis of command and direction when\nspontaneous consent has failed\u201d (SPN: 220\u201321).\n\nGramsci drew on a distinction, common in Italian political thought,\nbetween \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cconsent\u201d. Hegemony\nreferred to consent, although this was understood usually to be\nbalanced with force. Modern states aimed to absorb threats to their\npower by winning over potentially hostile social groups and classes,\ncompromising the immediate interests of the dominant class to maintain\ngeneral support. Such efforts may often be fragile or limited, but\nthat basic condition fundamentally altered the terrain of political\ncontest. States could not be reduced to mere administrative units of\nexecutive authority\u2014that is, to a separate \u201cpolitical\nsociety\u201d\u2014but were intertwined with a \u201csturdy\nstructure of civil society\u201d\u2014schools, churches,\n\u201cprivate associations\u201d, newspapers, intellectuals and so\non (SPN: 238). Unlike in Russia\u2014where state power was strong and\ncivil society weak (\u201cprimordial and\ngelatinous\u201d)\u2014modern states utilize the\n\u201ctrenches\u201d of civil society by exercising \u201ccivil\nhegemony\u201d (SPN: 243). This protected them from the threats to\ntheir rule caused by economic crises or civil disruption.\n\nThe state, then, was a complex structure combining both force and\nconsent: it was both the instrument by which a ruling class maintained\nits dominance over society and the medium through which it\nundertook a \u201ccivilising activity\u201d, functioning as an\n\u201cethical state\u201d or \u201ceducator\u201d by promoting\n\u201ca certain way of life\u201d for its citizens (SPN: 247; see\nalso SPN: 12). At one point Gramsci formulated this as \u201cState =\npolitical society + civil society (in other words hegemony protected\nby the armour of coercion)\u201d, or what he also called an\n\u201cintegral\u201d conception of the state.\n\nGramsci\u2019s remarks elaborated his earlier rejection of an\nexclusively insurrectionary model of revolution. In the\nNotebooks he was further suggesting that hegemony described a\ngeneral condition applicable to both bourgeois and proletarian forms\nof rule. Revolutionary transformation\u2014for any\nclass\u2014cannot be focused exclusively on the seizure of coercive\nand bureaucratic power but must engage the state\u2019s wider system\nof defenses. He referred to this in the military terms that had become\ncommonplace after the First World War as a switch from a \u201cwar of\nmanoeuvre\u201d\u2014a direct and violent assault on the forces of\nthe state\u2014to a \u201cwar of position\u201d\u2014the gradual\nwinning of tactical strongholds (SPN: 238\u201339). A revolutionary\nproject, he suggested, must first build consent across civil society\nbefore taking formal power (SPN: 57). That did not mean that\ncoercion would never be necessary, only that its status was\ndiminished in modern states.\n\nUnderstanding variations in the exercise of hegemony required a\npolitical analysis attuned to the \u201cequilibrium\u201d of force\nand consent at any conjuncture. In place of the common Marxist\ndivision of economic \u201cstructure\u201d and\n\u201csuperstructure\u201d, Gramsci proposed the concept of a\n\u201chistorical bloc\u201d (blocco storico). This was a\ncomposite of distinct class and social forces joined politically and\nculturally under a specific form of hegemony (SPN: 137). Additionally,\nit was possible to gauge the extent to which a class had sacrificed\nits \u201ceconomic corporate\u201d interests in expanding its\nleadership across civil society (SPN: 161). Empirical analysis of\nhegemony would assess the \u201crelations of forces\u201d that\ncombined structures and superstructures in a historical situation\n(SPN: 181\u201385; for a discussion, see Bellamy & Schecter 1993:\nch. 6).\n\nGramsci explored various historical examples and concepts of political\nrule in the Notebooks. In extensive notes on the Italian\nRisorgimento (the period of state building in the nineteenth century)\nhe highlighted the failure of the northern bourgeoisie to develop an\nextensive hegemonic leadership by incorporating\n\u201csubaltern\u201d social classes in the South (see SPN:\n52\u2013120). He borrowed the concept of \u201cpassive\nrevolution\u201d to describe this situation in which a change in\neconomic structure occurs but without a radical political\ntransformation; this was a concept he also suggested could describe\nFascism (SPN: 105\u201320).\n3.3 The Theory of Intellectuals\n\nIntellectuals formed a major theme of the Notebooks and\ndeveloped Gramsci\u2019s brief observations on the topic prior to his\narrest. Intellectuals, he noted,\n\n\nare the dominant group\u2019s \u201cdeputies\u201d exercising the\nsubaltern functions of social hegemony and political government. (SPN:\n12)\n\n\nAs such, they were key agents in the state\u2019s connection to civil\nsociety.\n\nTo understand their role in organizing consent, he argued, it was\nnecessary to expand the concept of intellectual. Rather than refer to\nacademics or artists, who work explicitly with ideas, the category\ncomprised all those whose social function was to communicate with, and\neducate, non-specialists (SPN: 9). Those undertaking the function of\nintellectuals included industrial technicians, managers,\nentrepreneurs, bureaucrats, and scientists. Gramsci distinguished\nbetween \u201corganic\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d types:\norganic intellectuals emerged from a specific social class and\nfunctioned to elaborate that class\u2019s productive activity as a\nset of general principles; traditional intellectuals, such as\nphilosophers or the clergy, were remnants of a former historical stage\nwho retained social prestige but no longer directly served a\nproductive class. Intellectuals were therefore rooted in material\nrelations of production but undertook the \u201ccritical\nelaboration\u201d of that activity into a \u201cnew and integral\nconception of the world\u201d (SPN: 9).\n\nThe construction of hegemony, Gramsci underlined, would require both\nthe elaboration of new organic intellectuals and the assimilation of\ntraditional intellectuals. He noted that his work with Ordine\nNuovo in Turin had already involved developing new forms of\n\u201cintellectualism\u201d among skilled workers who constituted,\nin his view, the organic intellectuals of a future communist society\n(SPN: 9\u201310). In his notes on \u201cAmericanism and\nFordism\u201d, he explored this theme in modern rationalized and\nmechanized production systems, still with little optimism that\nproletarian organic intellectuals were ready to promote a new\nworldview (SPN: 279\u2013318). Notably, Gramsci devoted considerable\nattention to an assessment of Croce, a traditional intellectual with\nan unparalleled \u201crole in Italian life\u201d (FSPN: 360),\ncomparable \u201cwith that of the Pope in the Catholic world\u201d\n(FSPN: 469; see also SPN: 94\u201395).\n3.4 Ideology and Common Sense\n\nGramsci\u2019s attention to intellectuals connected to his\nreflections on popular consciousness and its practical organization\nin, for example, religion, education, language, and folklore (see\nFSPN: 1\u2013137, 138\u201360; SPN: 26\u201343; SCW: 167\u201395).\nPopular attitudes, he underlined\u2014drawing on his linguistic\ntraining\u2014should not be dismissed but, rather, understood as part\nof how ordinary people lived and experienced their world (see Ives\n2004). They were also the medium through which hegemony was\nexercised.\n\nThe tendency among Marxists to diminish \u201cideology and\npolitics\u201d, reducing them to an immediate expression of an\neconomic structure, was dismissed by Gramsci as \u201cprimitive\ninfantilism\u201d (SPN: 407). Instead, ideology should be grasped as\na conception of the world that \u201cserves to cement and\nunify\u201d human practice (SPN: 328). It had a lived\n\u201cpsychological\u201d validity that enabled people to become\nconscious of their practical situations, however inadequately (SPN:\n377). It was therefore important to explore and understand that\npractical function. Gramsci did this in his remarks on \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d (senso comune).\n\nCommon sense\u2014popular attitudes and beliefs, frequently accepted\nas \u201ceternal\u201d truths by ordinary people\u2014denoted, for\nGramsci, a largely uncritical and \u201cfragmentary\u201d mode of\nconsciousness (SPN: 419). Consisting of superstitions and forms of\n\u201cfolklore\u201d concerning the nature of reality and ethical\nconduct, common sense was a \u201cphilosophy of the popular\nmasses\u201d, often born from religion, that differentiated\n\u201csimple\u201d folk from educated intellectuals. Its danger was\nthat it tended to invite resignation and passivity rather than\ncollective action. That was a problem for what Gramsci referred to as\n\u201csubaltern\u201d groups\u2014marginalized and subordinate\nclasses such as the peasantry and the proletariat\u2014who, despite\nperiodic rebellions, never adequately challenge dominant classes (see\nGreen 2002). Yet, common sense thinking often had a \u201chealthy\nnucleus\u201d in \u201cgood sense\u201d, that is, in the practical\nand realistic attitudes that could be made \u201cmore coherent and\nunitary\u201d (SPN: 328) if joined to a systematic and critical\nconception of the world. It was necessary not to dismiss common sense\nthinking (nor the struggles of subaltern groups) but to critically\nengage the \u201ccontradictory consciousness\u201d of ordinary\npeople (SPN: 326)\u2014that is, the tendency to hold beliefs\ncontradicted by actual conduct\u2014and educate it.\n\nGramsci understood that educative task to belong to\nintellectuals\u2014not merely to advance a superior and abstract\nphilosophy but to work on common sense, thereby \u201crenovating and\nmaking \u2018critical\u2019 an already existing activity\u201d\n(SPN: 331). A hegemonic worldview had to connect to the\n\u201csimple\u201d to become embedded in everyday life. The past\nsuccess of traditional intellectuals in this regard explained the\nongoing influence of the Catholic Church in Italy.\n3.5 The Philosophy of Praxis\n\nThe Notebooks present an extensive critique of what Gramsci\nsaw as the prevailing orthodoxy in Marxist philosophy. Exemplary here\nwas the analysis by the Russian philosopher and economist, Nikolai\nBukharin, in his Theory of Historical Materialism: A Popular\nManual of Marxist Sociology (published in 1921), a text Gramsci\nhad utilized in party schools. Gramsci now rejected Bukharin\u2019s\ntreatment of Marxism as a deterministic science of society and used\nhis text as a foil to present an alternative account of historical\nmaterialism that he labelled the \u201cphilosophy of praxis\u201d,\nfollowing the late nineteenth century Hegelian Marxist philosopher,\nAntonio Labriola. Gramsci probably used Labriola\u2019s term to evade\nthe prison censor but, undoubtedly, it captured the primacy he gave to\npractical, political questions in his approach to theorizing. He saw\nMarxism as a philosophy aimed at critically engaging popular common\nsense, laying the basis for a new hegemony.\n\nThe Popular Manual, as Gramsci referred to it, demonstrated\nthe worst of what he called \u201cvulgar materialism\u201d (SPN:\n407). It reduced Marxism to a search for the causal laws of social\nevolution and accepted, without reflection, the positive sciences as\nthe sole model of knowledge. It took up a speculative\n\u201cmethod\u201d positioned outside of history to observe\nsupposedly \u201cobjective\u201d mechanical regularities and to make\npredictions about their development (see SPN: 425\u201340). This view\nwas mistaken for various reasons: instead of treating Marxism as an\noriginal philosophy, it subordinated it to the natural sciences; it\nfailed to grasp the \u201cdialectic\u201d in Marxism, which\nunderscored the critical struggle against established thought (SPN:\n434\u201335); and it separated thought from action, \u201cscience\nand life\u201d, and therefore divided intellectuals with knowledge\nfrom the experiences of \u201cthe great popular masses\u201d (SPN:\n442).\n\nTo remedy these defects, Gramsci argued that Marxism, or historical\nmaterialism, be understood as a philosophy rooted in history, as an\nexpression of the practical struggle to rethink those circumstances\nanew. As such it \u201ccontains in itself all the fundamental\nelements to construct a total and integral conception of the\nworld\u201d (SPN: 462). Thought and action should be understood as\ndialectically intertwined in a developmental process that can\n\u201cbring into being a new form of State [\u2026] a new\nintellectual and moral order [\u2026] a new type of society\u201d\n(SPN: 388). Historical materialism was not an abstract framework from\nwhich merely to observe historical change; it was the philosophical\nvehicle whose expansion into a cultural outlook aimed to bring about\nthat change (see FSPN: 395\u201396). Gramsci affirmed\nLabriola\u2019s designation of Marxism as a \u201cphilosophy of\npraxis\u201d because it insisted on the unity of thought and action\n(praxis)\u2014and, through that, the gradual formation of an\nautonomous moral and cultural worldview\u2014as the guiding principle\nof Marx\u2019s philosophy (SPN: 388).\n\nGramsci also proposed that Croce\u2019s idealism could be of\n\u201cinstrumental value\u201d to a renewed philosophy of praxis.\nInfluenced by Marxism, Crocean historicism conceived thought and\nexpression as entirely \u201cimmanent\u201d to history, that is, as\nresponses to concrete problems, undetermined by any transcendent\nscheme or teleology. Croce presented \u201cliberty\u201d as the\nunifying ethical principle expressing this historicist sensibility;\nthe basis to what he conceived as a modern religion. Gramsci\nacknowledged that Croce had\n\n\nforcefully drawn attention to the importance of cultural and\nintellectual factors in the development of history [\u2026] to the\nmoment of hegemony and consent. (FSPN: 357)\n\n\nYet, he claimed, Croce also erased class conflict in his historical\nwriting, emphasizing only periods of liberal hegemony\u2014the\nconsensual, ethical aspects of history and not the violence or\npolitical struggles that ushered in bourgeois society, such as the\nFrench Revolution (SPN: 119; see also GPL: 213\u201314,\n215\u201316). By contrast, a philosophy of praxis would build on\nCroce\u2019s insights, focusing instead on\n\u201cethico-political\u201d history\u2014the socio-economic\ndivisions that bring, dialectically, a new culture into\nexistence\u2014without his partial, liberal gloss. It would\nvigorously critique received common sense beliefs, philosophies, and\nhierarchies that prevented the advance of ordinary people (SPN:\n330\u201331). Gramsci described the philosophy of praxis as an\n\u201cabsolute \u2018historicism\u2019, the absolute secularisation\nand earthliness of thought\u201d (SPN: 465).\n\nIn rejecting the scientific model of knowledge in favor of a form of\nhistorical consciousness, Gramsci radically shifted Marxism\u2019s\nepistemological bearings. The measure of historical materialism lay\nnot exclusively in the immediate empirical \u201ctruth\u201d of its\npropositions or predictions but, moreover, in the cultural and\npolitical efficacy of its overall intellectual and moral reform, which\nenabled creative subjective engagement with objective conditions:\n\u201cit is a philosophy which is also politics\u201d (SPN: 395). He\nsuggested that mass \u201cadhesion or non-adhesion to an ideology is\nthe real critical test of the rationality and historicity of modes of\nthinking\u201d, not just direct correspondence of theory to an\nindependent reality (SPN: 341); and that \u201cprediction\u201d was\nnot so much \u201ca scientific act of knowledge\u201d as \u201cthe\nabstract expression of the effort made, the practical way of creating\na collective will\u201d (SPN: 438). Gramsci compared the philosophy\nof praxis to the Protestant Reformation in so far as its success\nresided in generating cultural agreement to cement civil and political\nunity (SPN: 395).\n\nGramsci was not suggesting that truth was only a matter of\nshared agreement. The philosophy of praxis still aligned to the\nfoundational Marxist principle that social consciousness\n\u201ccorresponds\u201d to material relations of production,\nknowledge of which was necessary for any practical effort. Marxism\ntherefore required \u201cthe critique of ideologies\u201d which\n\u201ctend to hide reality\u201d (FSPN: 396) and, in this, it sought\nto bring thought and action into rational correspondence. But the\nphilosophy of praxis could achieve that only if it were grasped as a\nform of politics, not an abstract science.\n\nThese comments are consistent with Gramsci\u2019s general line of\nargument in the Notebooks on the strategic importance of\nbuilding consent prior to revolution. They indicate that such a\nstrategy was not a momentary, tactical initiative. It aligned with his\naspiration for a cultural transformation over the longer term. His\nfocus on the subjective, \u201csuperstructural\u201d element of\nclass politics certainly put Gramsci at odds with more objectivist\naccounts of Marxism, but it was far from an aversion to the reality of\n\u201cstructural\u201d and empirical constraints (see Morera 1990).\nWhatever its shortcomings as a generalizable Marxist theory,\nGramsci\u2019s philosophy of praxis was in keeping with his attempt\nto conceive revolutionary politics as the preparation of a\n\u201ctotal, integral civilisation\u201d (SPN: 462; see Thomas\n2009).\n3.6 The Modern Prince\n\nGramsci still considered the agent of a revolution to be, by\nnecessity, a centralized and ideologically disciplined party. But now\nhe presented the party as the vehicle of a \u201ctotal and integral\nconception of the world\u201d that, in advance of the revolution\nitself, would organize across civil society.\n\nThe character of the revolutionary party, for Gramsci, could be\ngrasped by reference to Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\u2019s treatise on\npolitical leadership, The Prince. The figure of the prince\ncombined in one person both tactical calculation and an ambition to\nlead the people in building a state (see SPN: 125). That image of\nleadership, Gramsci continued, was later exemplified in Georges\nSorel\u2019s notion of \u201cmyth\u201d, that is, a motivating\nideal or \u201cconcrete phantasy which acts on a dispersed and\nshattered people to arouse and organise its collective will\u201d\n(SPN: 126). Elaborating and diffusing \u201cconceptions of the\nworld\u201d was what modern political parties were designed to do\n(SPN: 335). Gramsci\u2019s reflections on communist party strategy\nwere therefore formulated as a treatise on what he conceived as\n\u201cThe Modern Prince\u201d (il moderno Principe).\n\nDrawing from the experience of the French Revolution, a modern Prince\n(or revolutionary party) must present itself as the type of\n\u201cJacobin force\u201d which then had \u201cawakened and\norganised the national-popular collective will, and founded the modern\nStates\u201d (SPN: 131). Its strategy could not be oriented\nexclusively to the moment of revolutionary rupture but, moreover,\n\u201cto the question of intellectual and moral reform, that is to\nthe question of religion or world-view\u201d (SPN: 132). The\nparty\u2019s aim was to realize \u201ca superior, total form of\nmodern civilisation\u201d rooted in economic relations (SPN: 133).\nYet the \u201cnational-popular\u201d dimension required it to do\nthis by transcending the corporate interests of one class alone,\npresenting its goals on a \u201cuniversal plane\u201d: \u201cthus\ncreating the hegemony of a fundamental group over a series of\nsubordinate groups\u201d (SPN: 182). The party would lead by making\nitself the repository of popular common sense, gathering the support\nof allied intellectuals, and developing its own distinct worldview\nbuilt on the philosophy of praxis. Gramsci\u2019s conception of the\nparty\u2019s role, therefore, went beyond a temporary or mechanical\nalliance of separate classes; it meant mobilizing a wholly new and\ninclusive vision of modern society.\n\nThe modern Prince was to be organized in such a way as to maintain\ncontact with workers, but also to ensure disciplined leadership. It\nwould be a party of \u201cordinary, average men\u201d, with a\nleadership \u201cendowed with great cohesive, centralising and\ndisciplinary powers\u201d, and an \u201cintermediate element\u201d\nto keep the two in mutual contact (SPN: 152\u201353). The party would\nthus be a mass-based organization under firm direction. To ensure\n\u201corganic\u201d discipline, Gramsci endorsed the principle of\n\u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d whereby decisions would be open to\ndiscussion by rank-and-file members. But, once taken, those decisions\nwould be unquestioningly obeyed. That way \u201cbureaucratic\u201d\nrigidity would be avoided and\n\n\nthere would be a continual adaptation of the organisation to the real\nmovement; a matching of thrusts from below with orders from above.\n(SPN: 188)\n\n\nThis hybrid of classically \u201cLeninist\u201d and mass-based\nmodels of the party reflected Gramsci\u2019s concern to steer a\ncourse between sectarian closure and reformist, representational\npolitics. Gramsci was not optimistic that ordinary members could\nparticipate effectively without strong direction from a disciplined\ncadre, however much he thought revolution would eventually overcome\nthe separation of leaders and led (SPN: 144). Hegemonic strategy\ninevitably meant creating a new leading elite (SPN: 340) whose\nsuperior philosophy would \u201cin the masses as such, [\u2026]\nonly be experienced as a faith\u201d (SPN: 339). Although some see in\nGramsci\u2019s politics the basis of a radically democratic politics\n(Sassoon 1987), his was not a particularly liberal conception (see\nFemia 1981: 172\u201385).\n4. Reception of the Prison Writings\n\nGramsci\u2019s prison writings were first published in Italy after\nthe Second World War: his letters from prison in 1947 (see GLP),\nwinning the Viareggio literary prize that year; and his\nNotebooks in six, thematic volumes of selections between 1948\nand 1951. A complete, \u201ccritical\u201d edition of the\nNotebooks (in four volumes) was published in 1975 (see\nQC).\n\nThe distance in time since their drafting, and the fragmented nature\nof the texts themselves, meant that the prison writings did not\ndirectly address the new environment into which they emerged. The\nmeaning and implications of his thinking were therefore heavily\nmediated by national and geopolitical concerns through which,\ninevitably, the Notebooks were read. Over time\u2014as his\nwritings became available and scholarship on his thought\nimproved\u2014recognition of his distinctiveness as a thinker has\ngrown around the world. Gramsci\u2019s account of hegemony,\nespecially, has been a highly effective resource for cultural and\npolitical analysis (see Martin 2022).\n\nWhere precisely did Gramsci\u2019s philosophical innovations lie for\nhis later readers? Over the years, different, interpretations of\nGramsci have tended to emphasize competing aspects of his thought as\nits philosophical \u201ccore\u201d (see Liguori 2012 [2022]).\n\nThe initial reception of Gramsci\u2019s writings was shaped by the\nItalian Communist Party (Partito comunista italiano, or PCI),\nparticularly by its leader since the mid-1920s, Palmiro Togliatti, who\nemphasized their significance for a renewed communist strategy. To\ndemonstrate allegiance to Stalin and the USSR, Togliatti presented an\n\u201cacceptable\u201d version of Gramsci that suited the\nPCI\u2019s cautious post-war politics. Selective editing of the\nNotebooks downplayed overt conflict with Stalin, emphasizing\nGramsci\u2019s continuity with the Soviet philosophical orthodoxy of\n\u201cdialectical materialism\u201d and a Leninist model of\nrevolution. However, following Stalin\u2019s death in 1953 Togliatti\nunderscored Gramsci\u2019s unique formulation of Marxism and his\ncontinuity with native Italian currents of philosophy. This endorsed\nTogliatti\u2019s own view of the PCI as a pragmatic, mass-based party\npursuing its own \u201cItalian road to socialism\u201d; operating as\na \u201ccollective intellectual\u201d to mobilize the proletariat\nand its allies in a uniquely national and democratic project (see\nTogliatti 1979).\n\nNow a canonical figure in Italian Marxism, Gramsci\u2019s reading of\nhistory\u2014particularly his view of the Risorgimento as a failed\nbourgeois revolution\u2014was called into question in the late 1950s.\nIn one notable debate, liberal historian Rosario Romeo disputed that\neconomic conditions could have permitted the nineteenth-century\nbourgeoisie to act as a \u201cJacobin\u201d force by mobilizing the\npeasantry and other subaltern classes. Gramsci\u2019s reasoning (and,\nby extension, the PCI\u2019s sense of its distinctive national\nstrategy) was premised on a moral and political, rather than genuinely\nobjective, interpretation of history (Liguori 2012 [2022:\n121\u201323]; Davis 1979).\n\nAlthough Romeo\u2019s critique was disputed by Gramscian historians,\nfrom the 1960s, as more of his writings were published and\ntranslations became available, Gramsci was increasingly read\nindependently of (and in opposition to) the PCI\u2019s strategic\nconcerns (see Mouffe 1979). His seemingly \u201cheretical\u201d\nformulation of Marxist theory came to occupy his readers, especially\nas regards his debt to Crocean historicism, his ambiguous relation to\nmaterialism and to Leninism (see Bobbio 1979). More widely,\nGramsci\u2019s exploration of cultural and political superstructures\nresulted in a tendency to categorize him as a \u201cwestern\u201d\nMarxist, concerned less with economic conditions or coercion and more\nwith ideological barriers to class consciousness (see Anderson 1976,\n1976\u201377). Hegemony was associated with a general theory of\ncultural and ideological domination relevant to the critique of\nconsumer capitalism.\n\nThrough the late 1960s and 70s, as western states experienced economic\nand ideological crises, Gramsci\u2019s analyses were applied\nseparately from communist strategy or philosophical idealism. Marxist\nsociologists such as Nicos Poulantzas (1968 [1973]) and, later, Bob\nJessop (1990) found in hegemony a resource to explore the permutations\nof the capitalist state and its shifting class coalitions. British\nCultural Studies\u2014especially the work of Raymond Williams and\nStuart Hall\u2014saw in Gramsci an inventive, \u201ccultural\nMarxist\u201d framework for examining popular lived experience of\nclass domination. Debates over the functions of mass media and\npopulist ideology, particularly with the emergence of\n\u201cThatcherism\u201d in the 1980s, were uniquely attuned to the\ndynamics of hegemonic politics suggested in Gramsci\u2019s writings\n(see Hall 1988; Jessop et al. 1988).\n\n\u201cPost-Marxist\u201d approaches to hegemony from the 1980s built\non the established popularity of Gramsci\u2019s thought, particularly\nits application in the field of ideology studies. Ernesto Laclau and\nChantal Mouffe\u2019s Hegemony and Socialist Strategy (1985)\nrecast hegemony as the theoretical basis to a strategy of\n\u201cradical democracy\u201d, aimed at unifying multiple and\ndiverse social struggles. Drawing on \u201cpoststructuralist\u201d\nphilosophies, hegemony was conceived as a general principle of\n\u201cdiscursive articulation\u201d\u2014the contingent formation\nof a collective identity\u2014with no \u201cnecessary\u201d\nfoundation in economic class. For them, Gramsci\u2019s core\nphilosophical insight lay in demonstrating hegemony\u2019s political\n\u201clogic\u201d, rather than any sociological concerns. They\nsought to discard the residual economism in his thinking and thus the\nautomatic privilege granted by Marxism to class agency in hegemonic\npolitics. In their view, various hegemonic formations co-exist, and a\nradical democratic politics does not require working class\nleadership.\n\nGramsci\u2019s Notebooks continued to attract scholarly\ninterest after the demise of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of\nthe PCI. Recent approaches have been drawn, increasingly, to the\nnuances and inflections in his analyses, often neglected in the\ntendency to focus on \u201chegemony\u201d and its relation to\nMarxist theory. While the concept remains important, there is growing\nappreciation of other themes in Gramsci\u2019s philosophy of politics\nand their relevance to a variety of fields. His ideas remain a source\nof insight for non-orthodox Marxisms (see Thomas 2009), and his\nconcepts have been extended to academic fields such as International\nRelations and Global Political Economy (see Gill 1993) and to\nsocio-political contexts beyond Europe and the \u201cWest\u201d (see\nMorton 2007; Fonseca\n2016).  Gramsci\u2019s own experience as an internal migrant who\n\u201clooked at modernity from the bottom of its peripheries\u201d\n(Urbinati 1998: 371), and his particular attention to the struggles of\n\u201csubaltern\u201d classes in the formation of national cultures,\nhave inspired forms of postcolonial literary criticism and politics\nquite at odds with the communist frame in which his ideas originated\n(see Srivastava & Bhattacharya 2012).\n",
