    "main_text": "The Doctrine of Religious Restraint || Core Components of the Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n2.1 Core Components of the Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n\n\nThe standard view has often been misunderstood, typically by\nassociating the DRR with claims its advocates are free to deny.\nIt will therefore be helpful to dissociate the DRR from various common\nmisunderstandings.\n\n\n First, the DRR is a moral constraint,\none that applies to people in virtue of the fact that they are citizens\nof a liberal democracy. As such, it need not be encoded into law,\nenforced by state coercion or social stigma, promoted in state\neducational institutions, or in any other way policed by the powers\nthat be. Of course, advocates of restraint are free to argue that\nthe state should police violations of the DRR (see Habermas 2006,\n 10).[5]\nPerhaps some liberal democracies do police something like the\nDRR. But advocates of the standard view needn't endorse\nrestrictions of this\n sort.[6]\n\n\n Second, the DRR does not\nrequire a thorough-going privatization of religious commitment.\nIndeed, the DRR permits religious considerations to\nplay a rather prominent role in a citizen's political practice:\ncitizens are permitted to vote for their favored coercive policies on\nexclusively religious grounds as well as to advocate publicly for those\npolicies on religious grounds. What the DRR does require of\ncitizens is that they reasonably believe that they have some plausible\nsecular rationale for each of the coercive laws that they support,\nwhich they are prepared to offer in political discussion.\nIn this respect, the present construal of the DRR is weaker than comparable\nproposals, such as that developed by Robert Audi, which requires that\neach citizen have and be motivated by some evidentially adequate\nsecular rationale for each of the coercive laws he or she supports (see\nAudi 1997, 138 and Rawls 1997, 784ff).\n\n\n Third, the DRR places few restrictions on\nthe content of the secular reasons to which citizens can appeal when\nsupporting coercive laws. Although the required secular reasons\nmust be \u201cplausible\u201d (more on this in a moment), they \nmay make essential reference to what Rawls\ncalls \u201ccomprehensive conceptions of the good,\u201d such as Platonism,\nKantianism, or\n utilitarianism.[7]\nAccordingly, the standard view does not\ncommit itself to a position according to which secular reasons must be\nincluded or otherwise grounded in a neutral source\u2014a set of\nprinciples regarding justice and the common good such that everybody\nhas good reason, apart from his own or any other religious or\nphilosophical perspective, to find acceptable. Somewhat more\nspecifically, advocates of the standard view needn't claim that\nsecular reasons must be found in what Rawls calls \u201cpublic\nreason,\u201d which (roughly speaking) is a fund of shared principles\nabout justice and the common good constructed from the shared\npolitical culture of a liberal democracy. That having been said, it is\nworth stressing that some prominent advocates of the standard view\nadopt a broadly Rawlsian account of the DRR, according to which\ncoercive laws must be justified by appeal to public reason (see\nGutmann and Thompson 1996, Larmore 1987, Macedo 1990, and\nNussbaum 2008). We shall have more to say about this view in section\n6.\n\n\n Fourth, the DRR itself has no determinate\npolicy implications; it is a constraint not on legislation itself, but\non the configuration of reasons to which agents may appeal when\nsupporting coercive legislation. So, for example, it forbids Rick\nto support the criminalization of homosexuality when he believes that\nthere are no plausible secular reasons to criminalize it. As\nsuch, the moral propriety of the DRR has nothing directly to do with\nits usefulness in furthering, or discouraging, particular policy\naims.\n\n\n The DRR, then, is a norm that is\nsupposed to provide guidance for how citizens of a liberal democracy\nshould conduct themselves when deliberating about or deciding on the implementation of\ncoercive laws. For our purposes, it will be helpful to work with\na canonical formulation of it. Let us, then, formulate the DRR as\nfollows:\n\nThe DRR: a citizen of a liberal democracy may\nsupport the implementation of a coercive law L just in case he\nreasonably believes himself to have a plausible secular justification\nfor L, which he is prepared to offer in political discussion.\n\n\nAbout this formulation of the DRR, let us make two points.\nFirst, in what follows, we will remain largely noncommittal about what\nthe qualifier \u201cplausible\u201d means, as advocates of the standard view\nunderstand it in different ways. For present purposes, we will\nsimply assume that a plausible rationale is one that epistemically and\nmorally competent peers will take seriously as a basis for supporting a\ncoercive law. Second, according to this formulation of the DRR, a\ncitizen can comply with the DRR even if he himself is not persuaded to\nsupport a coercive law for any secular reason. What matters is\nthat he believes that he has and can offer a secular rationale that his\nsecular cohorts can take seriously.\n\n\nSuppose, then, we have an adequate working conception of the DRR. The\nquestion naturally arises: Why do advocates of the standard view\nmaintain that we should conform to the DRR? For several reasons, most\nprominent of which are the following three arguments.  Of course,\nthere are many more arguments for the DRR than we can address here.\nSee, for example, Andrew Lister's appeal to the value of political\ncommunity (2013). \n",
