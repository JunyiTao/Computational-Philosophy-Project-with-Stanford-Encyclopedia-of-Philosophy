Virtue Epistemology and the Value Problem\n\nSo far this discussion has taken it as given that whatever problems\nreliabilism faces in this regard, there are epistemological theories\navailable\u2014some form of virtue epistemology, for\nexample\u2014that can deal with them. But not everyone in the\ncontemporary debate accepts this. Perhaps the best known sceptic in\nthis respect is Jonathan Kvanvig (2003), who in effect argues that\nwhile virtue epistemology (along with a form of epistemic internalism)\ncan resolve the primary value problem (i.e., the problem of explaining\nwhy knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief), the real\nchallenge that we need to respond to is that set by the secondary\nvalue problem (i.e., the problem of explaining why knowledge is more\nvaluable than that which falls short of knowledge); and Kvanvig says\nthat there is no solution available to that. That is, Kvanvig\nargues that there is an epistemic standing\u2014in essence, justified\ntrue belief\u2014which falls short of knowledge but which is no less\nvaluable than knowledge. He concludes that the focus of epistemology\nshould not be on knowledge at all, but rather on\nunderstanding, an epistemic standing that Kvanvig maintains\nis clearly of more value than knowledge and those epistemic\nstandings that fall short of knowledge, such as justified true\nbelief.\n\nWhat Kvanvig says about understanding will be considered below. First\nthough, let us consider the specific challenge that he poses for\nvirtue epistemology. In essence, Kvanvig\u2019s argument rests on the\nassumption that it is essential to any virtue-theoretic account of\nknowledge\u2014and any internalist account of knowledge as well, for\nthat matter (i.e., an account that makes a subjective justification\ncondition necessary for knowledge possession)\u2014that it also\nincludes an anti-Gettier condition. If this is right, then it follows\nthat even if virtue epistemology has an answer to the primary value\nproblem\u2014and Kvanvig concedes that it does\u2014it will not\nthereby have an answer to the secondary value problem since knowledge\nis not simply virtuous true belief. Moreover, Kvanvig argues that once\nwe recognize what a gerrymandered notion a non-Gettierized account of\nknowledge is, it becomes apparent that there is nothing valuable about\nthe anti-Gettier condition on knowledge that needs to be imposed. But\nif that is right, then it follows by even virtue epistemic lights that\nknowledge\u2014i.e., non-Gettierized virtuous true believing\u2014is\nno more valuable than one of its proper sub-sets\u2014i.e., mere\nvirtuous true believing.\n\nThere are at least two aspects of Kvanvig\u2019s argument that are\npotentially problematic. To begin with, it isn\u2019t at all clear\nwhy the anti-Gettier condition on knowledge fails to add value,\nsomething that seems to be assumed here. More generally, Kvanvig seems\nto be implicitly supposing that if an analysis of knowledge is ugly\nand gerrymandered then that is itself reason to doubt that knowledge\nis particularly valuable, at least assuming that there are epistemic\nstandings that fall short of knowledge which can be given an elegant\nanalysis. While a similar assumption about the relationship between\nthe elegance (or otherwise) of the analysis of knowledge and the value\nof the analysandum is commonplace in the contemporary epistemological\nliterature\u2014see, for example, Zagzebski (1999) and Williamson\n(2000: chapter 1)\u2014this assumption is contentious. For critical\ndiscussion of this assumption, see DePaul (2009).\n\nIn any case, a more serious problem is that many virtue\nepistemologists\u2014among them Sosa (1988, 1991, 2007), Zagzebski\n(e.g., 1996, 1999) and Greco (2003, 2007, 2008, 2009)\u2014hereafter,\n\u2018robust virtue epistemologists\u2019\u2014think that their\nview can deal with Gettier problems without needing to add an\nadditional anti-Gettier condition on knowledge. The way this is\nachieved is by making the move noted above of treating knowledge as a\nstate that includes both the truly believing and the virtuous source\nby which that true belief was acquired. However, crucially, for robust\nvirtue epistemologists, there is an important difference between (i) a\nbelief\u2019s being true and virtuously formed, and (ii) a\nbelief\u2019s being true because virtuously formed.\nFormulating knowledge along the latter lines, they insist, ensures\nthat the target belief is not Gettiered. Even more, robust virtue\nepistemologists think the latter kind of formulation offers the\nresources to account for why knowledge is distinctively valuable.\n\nTo appreciate this point about value, consider the following\n\u2018performance normativity framework\u2019 which robust virtue\nepistemologists explicitly or implicitly embrace when accounting for\nthe value of knowledge as a true belief because of virtue.\n\n\nPerformance Normativity Framework\n\nDimensions of evaluation thesis Any performance with an aim\ncan be evaluated along three dimensions: (i) whether it is successful,\n(ii) whether it is skillful, and (iii) thirdly, whether the success is\nbecause of the skill.\n\nAchievement thesis If and only if the success is because of\nthe skill, the performance is not merely successful, but also, an\nachievement.\n\nValue thesis Achievements are finally valuable (i.e.,\nvaluable for their own sake) in a way that mere lucky successes are\nnot.\n\n\nNotice that, if knowledge is a cognitive performance that is an\nachievement, then with reference to the above set of claims,\nthe robust virtue epistemologist can respond to not only the secondary\nvalue problem but also the tertiary value problem (i.e., the problem\nof explaining why knowledge is more valuable, in kind and not merely\nin degree, than that which falls short of knowledge). This is because\nknowledge, on this view, is simply the cognitive aspect of a more\ngeneral notion, that of achievement, and this is the case even if mere\nsuccesses that are produced by intellectual virtues but which are not\nbecause of them, are not achievements.\u00a0(Though, see Kim\n2021 for a reversal of the idea that knowledge involves achievement;\naccording to Kim, all achievements, in any domain of endeavour, imply\nknowledge).\n\nAs regards the value thesis, one might object that some\nsuccesses that are because of ability\u2014i.e., achievements, on\nthis view\u2014are too trivial or easy or wicked to count as finally\nvaluable. This line of objection is far from decisive. After all, it\nis open to the proponent of robust virtue epistemology to argue that\nthe claim is only that all achievements qua achievements are\nfinally valuable, not that the overall value of every achievement is\nparticularly high. It is thus consistent with the proposal that some\nachievements have a very low\u2014perhaps even negative, if that is\npossible\u2014value in virtue of their other properties (e.g., their\ntriviality). Indeed, a second option in this regard is to allow that\nnot all achievements enjoy final value whilst nevertheless maintaining\nthat it is in the nature of achievements to have such value (e.g.,\nmuch in the way that one might argue that it is in the nature of\npleasure to be a good, even though some pleasures are bad). Since, as\nnoted above, all that is required to meet the (tertiary) value problem\nis to show that knowledge is generally distinctively valuable, this\nclaim would almost certainly suffice for the robust virtue\nepistemologist\u2019s purposes.\n\nIn any case, even if the value thesis is correct\u2014and indeed,\neven if the achievement and dimensions of evaluation theses are also\ncorrect\u2014the robust virtue epistemologist has not yet\nsatisfactorily vindicated any of the aforementioned value problems for\nknowledge unless knowledge is itself a kind of achievement\u2014and\nthat is the element of the proposal that is perhaps the most\ncontroversial. There are two key problems with the claim that\nknowledge involves cognitive achievement. The first is that there\nsometimes seems to be more to knowledge than a cognitive achievement;\nthe second is that there sometimes seems to be less to knowledge than\na cognitive achievement.\n\nAs regards the first claim, notice that achievements seem to be\ncompatible with at least one kind of luck. Suppose that an archer hits\na target by employing her relevant archery abilities, but that the\nsuccess is \u2018gettierized\u2019 by luck intervening between the\narcher\u2019s firing of the arrow and the hitting of the target. For\nexample, suppose that a freak gust of wind blows the arrow off-course,\nbut then a second freak gust of wind happens to blow it back on course\nagain. The archer\u2019s success is thus lucky in the sense that it\ncould very easily have been a failure. When it comes to\n\u2018intervening\u2019 luck of this sort, Greco\u2019s account of\nachievements is able to offer a good explanation of why the success in\nquestion does not constitute an achievement. After all, we would not\nsay that the success was because of the archer\u2019s ability in this\ncase.\n\nNotice, however, that not all forms of luck are of this intervening\nsort. Consider the following case offered by Pritchard (2010a: ch. 2).\nSuppose that nothing intervenes between the archer\u2019s firing of\nthe arrow and the hitting of the target. However, the success is still\nlucky in the relevant sense because, unbeknownst to the archer, she\njust happened to fire at the only target on the range that did not\ncontain a forcefield which would have repelled the arrow. Is the\narcher\u2019s success still an achievement? Intuition would seem to\ndictate that it is; it certainly seems to be a success that is because\nof ability, even despite the luckiness of that success. Achievements,\nthen, are, it seems, compatible with luck of this\n\u2018environmental\u2019 form even though they are not compatible\nwith luck of the standard \u2018intervening\u2019 form.\n\nThe significance of this conclusion for our purposes is that knowledge\nis incompatible with both forms of luck. In order to see\nthis, one only needs to note that an epistemological analogue of the\narcher case just given is the famous barn fa\u00e7ade example (e.g.,\nGinet 1975; Goldman 1976). In this example, we have an agent who forms\na true belief that there is a barn in front of him. Moreover, his\nbelief is not subject to the kind of \u2018intervening\u2019 luck\njust noted and which is a standard feature of Gettier-style cases. It\nis not as if, for example, he is looking at what appears to be a barn\nbut which is not in fact a barn, but that his belief is true\nnonetheless because there is a barn behind the barn shaped object that\nhe is looking at. Nevertheless, his belief is subject to environmental\nluck in that he is, unbeknownst to him, in barn fa\u00e7ade county\nin which every other barn-shaped object is a barn fa\u00e7ade. Thus,\nhis belief is only luckily true in that he could very easily have been\nmistaken in this respect. Given that this example is structurally\nequivalent to the \u2018archer\u2019 case just given, it seems that\njust as we treat the archer as exhibiting an achievement in that case,\nso we should treat this agent as exhibiting a cognitive achievement\nhere. The problem, however, is that until quite recently many\nphilosophers accepted that the agent in the barn fa\u00e7ade case\nlacks knowledge. Knowledge, it seems, is incompatible with\nenvironmental luck in a way that achievements, and thus cognitive\nachievements, are not (see, for example, Pritchard, e.g., 2012).\n\nRobust virtue epistemologists have made a number of salient points\nregarding this case. For example, Greco (2010, 2012) has argued for a\nconception of what counts as a cognitive ability according to which\nthe agent in the barn fa\u00e7ade case would not count as exhibiting\nthe relevant cognitive ability (see Pritchard 2010a: ch. 2 for a\ncritical discussion of this claim). Others, such as Sosa (e.g., 2007,\n2015) have responded by questioning whether the agent in the barn\nfa\u00e7ade case lacks knowledge, albeit, in a qualified sense.\nWhile Sosa\u2019s distinctive virtue epistemology allows for the\ncompatibility of barn fa\u00e7ade cases with animal\nknowledge (roughly: true belief because of ability), Sosa\nmaintains that the subject in barn fa\u00e7ade cases lacks\nreflective knowledge (roughly: a true belief whose\ncreditability to ability or virtue is itself creditable to a\nsecond-order ability or virtue of the agent). Other philosophers\n(e.g., Hetherington (1998) have challenged the view that barn\nfa\u00e7ade protagonists in fact lack (any kind of) knowledge. In a\nseries of empirical studies, most people attributed knowledge in barn\nfa\u00e7ade cases and related cases (Colaco, Buckwalter, Stich &\nMachery 2014; Turri, Buckwalter & Blouw 2015; Turri 2016a). In one\nstudy, over 80% of participants attributed knowledge (Turri 2016b). In\nanother study, most professional philosophers attributed knowledge\n(Horvath & Wiegmann 2016). At least one theory of knowledge has\nbeen defended on the grounds that it explains why knowledge is\nintuitively present in such cases (Turri 2016c).\n\nEven setting that issue aside, however, there is a second problem on\nthe horizon, which is that it seems that there are some cases of\nknowledge which are not cases of cognitive achievement. One such case\nis offered by Jennifer Lackey (2007), albeit to illustrate a slightly\ndifferent point. Lackey asks us to imagine someone arriving at the\ntrain station in Chicago who, wishing to obtain directions to the\nSears Tower, approaches the first adult passer-by she sees. Suppose\nthe person she asks is indeed knowledgeable about the area and gives\nher the directions that she requires. Intuitively, any true belief\nthat the agent forms on this basis would ordinarily be counted as\nknowledge. Indeed, if one could not gain testimonial knowledge in this\nway, then it seems that we know an awful lot less than we think we\nknow. However, it has been argued, in such a case the agent does not\nhave a true belief because of her cognitive abilities but, rather,\nbecause of her informant\u2019s cognitive abilities. If this\nis correct, then there are cases of knowledge which are not also cases\nof cognitive achievement.\n\nIt is worth being clear about the nature of this objection. Lackey\ntakes cases like this to demonstrate that one can possess knowledge\nwithout it being primarily creditable to one that one\u2019s belief\nis true. Note though that this is compatible, as Lackey notes, with\ngranting that the agent is employing her cognitive abilities\nto some degree, and so surely deserves some credit for the\ntruth of the belief formed (she would not have asked just anyone, for\nexample, nor would she have simply accepted just any answer given by\nher informant). The point is thus rather that whatever credit the\nagent is due for having a true belief, it is not the kind of credit\nthat reflects a bona fide cognitive achievement because of\nhow this cognitive success involves \u2018piggy-backing\u2019 on the\ncognitive efforts of others.\n",
