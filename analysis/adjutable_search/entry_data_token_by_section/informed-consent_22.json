    "main_text": "Exceptions to informed consent || Some risky experiments\n7.2 Some risky experiments\n\nAdvancing the field of emergency medicine requires medical\nexperimentation, including trials that compare different interventions\nand that only sometimes serve the best interests of trial\nparticipants. But, in emergency circumstances, it is often impossible\nto obtain consent from the patient or her family in time. Many\nphysicians believe that, because the field of emergency medicine\nsimply cannot progress absent experimentation, there should be an\nexception to informed consent requirements even for such risky trials,\nand substitutes for informed consent should be sought (Fost 1998;\nDickert et al. forthcoming). Some elements of informed consent, such\nas retrospective debriefing, remain relevant though (Dickert et al.\nforthcoming), again suggesting a \u201cbundled\u201d\nrequirement.\n",
