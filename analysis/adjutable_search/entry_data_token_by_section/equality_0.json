Defining the Concept\n\n\u2018Equality\u2019 is a contested concept: \u201cPeople who\npraise it or disparage it disagree about what they are praising or\ndisparaging\u201d (Dworkin 2000, p. 2). Our first task is therefore\nto provide a clear definition of equality in the face of widespread\nmisconceptions about its meaning as a political idea. The terms\n\u2018equality\u2019 (Greek: isotes; Latin:\naequitas, aequalitas; French:\n\u00e9galit\u00e9; German Gleichheit),\n\u2018equal\u2019, and \u2018equally\u2019 signify a qualitative\nrelationship. \u2018Equality\u2019 (or \u2018equal\u2019)\nsignifies correspondence between a group of different objects,\npersons, processes or circumstances that have the same qualities in at\nleast one respect, but not all respects, i.e., regarding one specific\nfeature, with differences in other features. \u2018Equality\u2019\nmust then be distinguished from \u2018identity\u2019, which refers\nto one and the same object corresponding to itself in all its\nfeatures. For the same reason, it needs to be distinguished from\n\u2018similarity\u2019 \u2013 the concept of merely approximate\ncorrespondence (Dann 1975, p. 997; Menne 1962, p. 44 ff.; Westen 1990,\npp. 39, 120). Thus, to say that men are equal, for example, is not to\nsay that they are identical. Equality implies similarity rather than\n\u2018sameness\u2019.\n\nJudgements of equality presume a difference between the things\ncompared. According to this definition, the notion of\n\u2018complete\u2019 or \u2018absolute\u2019 equality may be seen\nas problematic because it would violate the presumption of a\ndifference. Two non-identical objects are never completely equal; they\nare different at least in their spatiotemporal location. If things do\nnot differ they should not be called \u2018equal\u2019, but rather,\nmore precisely, \u2018identical\u2019, such as the morning and the\nevening star. Here usage might vary. Some authors do consider absolute\nqualitative equality admissible as a borderline concept (Tugendhat\n& Wolf 1983, p. 170).\n\n\u2018Equality\u2019 can be used in the very same sense both to\ndescribe and prescribe, as with \u2018thin\u2019: \u201cyou are\nthin\u201d and \u201cyou are too thin\u201d. The approach taken to\ndefining the standard of comparison for both descriptive and\nprescriptive assertions of equality is very important (Oppenheim\n1970). In the descriptive case, the common standard is itself\ndescriptive, for example when two people are said to have the same\nweight. In the prescriptive use, the standard prescribes a\nnorm or rule, for example when it is said people ought to be equal\nbefore the law. The standards grounding prescriptive assertions of\nequality contain at least two components. On the one hand, there is a\ndescriptive component, since the assertions need to contain\ndescriptive criteria, in order to identify those people to which the\nrule or norm applies. The question of this identification \u2013 who\nbelongs to which category? \u2013 may itself be normative, as when we\nask to whom the U.S. laws apply. On the other hand, the comparative\nstandards contain something normative \u2013 a moral or legal rule,\nsuch as the U.S. laws \u2013 specifying how those falling under the\nnorm are to be treated. Such a rule constitutes the prescriptive\ncomponent (Westen 1990, chap. 3). Sociological and economic analyses\nof (in-)equality mainly pose the questions of how inequalities can be\ndetermined and measured and what their causes and effects are. In\ncontrast, social and political philosophy is in general concerned\nmainly with the following questions: what kind of equality,\nif any, should obtain, and with respect to whom and\nwhen? Such is the case in this article as well.\n\n\u2018Equality\u2019 and \u2018equal\u2019 are incomplete\npredicates that necessarily generate one question: equal in what\nrespect? (Rae 1980,p. 132 f.) Equality essentially consists of a\ntripartite relation between two (or several) objects or persons and\none (or several) qualities. Two objects A and B are equal in a certain\nrespect if, in that respect, they fall under the same general term.\n\u2018Equality\u2019 denotes the relation between the objects\ncompared. Every comparison presumes a tertium comparationis,\na concrete attribute defining the respect in which the equality\napplies \u2013 equality thus referring to a common sharing of this\ncomparison-determining attribute. This relevant comparative standard\nrepresents a \u2018variable\u2019 (or \u2018index\u2019) of the\nconcept of equality that needs to be specified in each particular case\n(Westen 1990, p. 10); differing conceptions of equality here emerge\nfrom one or another descriptive or normative moral standard. There is\nanother source of diversity as well: As Temkin (1986, 1993, 2009)\nargues, various different standards might be used to measure\ninequality, with the respect in which people are compared remaining\nconstant. The difference between a general concept and different\nspecific conceptions (Rawls 1971, p. 21 f.) of equality may explain\nwhy some people claim \u2018equality\u2019 has no unified\nmeaning \u2013 or is even devoid of meaning. (Rae 1981, p. 127 f.,\n132 f.)\n\nFor this reason, it helps to think of the idea of equality or\ninequality, in the context of social justice, not as a single\nprinciple, but as a complex group of principles forming the basic core\nof today\u2019s egalitarianism. Different principles yield\ndifferent answers. Both equality and inequality are complex and\nmultifaceted concepts (Temkin 1993, chap. 2). In any real historical\ncontext, it is clear that no single notion of equality can sweep the\nfield (Rae 1981, p. 132). Many egalitarians concede that much of our\ndiscussion of the concept is vague, but they believe there is also a\ncommon underlying strain of important moral concerns implicit in it\n(Williams 1973). Above all, it serves to remind us of our common\nhumanity, despite various differences (cf. 2.3. below). In this sense,\negalitarianism is often thought of as a single, coherent normative\ndoctrine that embraces a variety of principles. Following the\nintroduction of different principles and theories of equality, the\ndiscussion will return in the last section to the question how best to\ndefine egalitarianism and its core value.\n",
