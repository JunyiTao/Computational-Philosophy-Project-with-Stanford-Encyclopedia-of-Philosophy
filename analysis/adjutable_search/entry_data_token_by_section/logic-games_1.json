    "main_text": "Logical Games\n2. Logical Games\n\nFrom the point of view of game theory, the main games that logicians\nstudy are not at all typical. They normally involve just two players,\nthey often have infinite length, the only outcomes are winning and\nlosing, and no probabilities are attached to actions or outcomes. The\nbarest essentials of a logical game are as follows. \n\nThere are two players. In general we can call them \\(\\forall\\) and\n\\(\\exists\\). The pronunciations \u2018Abelard\u2019 and\n\u2018Eloise\u2019 go back to the mid 1980s and usefully fix the\nplayers as male and female making reference easier: her move, his\nmove. Other names are in common use for the players in particular\ntypes of logical game.\n\nThe players play by choosing elements of a set \\(\\Omega\\), called the\ndomain of the game. As they choose, they build up a\nsequence \n\n\\[\na_0, a_1, a_2,\\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nof elements of \\(\\Omega\\). Infinite sequences of elements of\n\\(\\Omega\\) are called plays. Finite sequences of elements of\n\\(\\Omega\\) are called positions; they record where a play\nmight have got to by a certain time. A function \\(\\tau\\) (the turn\nfunction or player function) takes each position\n\\(\\mathbf{a}\\) to either \\(\\exists\\) or \\(\\forall\\); if\n\\(\\tau(\\mathbf{a}) = \\exists\\), this means that when the game has\nreached \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), player \\(\\exists\\) makes the next choice (and\nlikewise with \\(\\forall)\\). The game rules define two sets\n\\(\\W_{\\forall}\\) and \\(\\W_{\\exists}\\) consisting of positions and\nplays, with the following properties: if a position \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is\nin \\(\\W_{\\forall}\\) then so is any play or longer position that starts\nwith \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) (and likewise with \\(\\W_{\\exists})\\); and no play\nis in both \\(\\W_{\\forall}\\) and \\(\\W_{\\exists}\\). We say that player\n\\(\\forall\\) wins a play \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and that\n\\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a win for \\(\\forall\\), if \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is\nin \\(\\W_{\\forall}\\); if some position \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) that is an\ninitial segment of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\W_{\\forall}\\), then we say\nthat player \\(\\forall\\) wins already at \\(\\mathbf{a}\\). (And\nlikewise with \\(\\exists\\) and \\(\\W_{\\exists}\\).) So to summarise, a\nlogical game is a 4-tuple \\((\\Omega , \\tau\\), \\(\\W_{\\forall}\\),\n\\(\\W_{\\exists})\\) with the properties just described.\n\nWe say that a logical game is total if every play is in\neither \\(\\W_{\\forall}\\) or \\(\\W_{\\exists}\\), so that there are no\ndraws. Unless one makes an explicit exception, logical games are\nalways assumed to be total. (Don\u2019t confuse being total with the\nmuch stronger property of being determined\u2014see below.)\n\nIt is only for mathematical convenience that the definition above\nexpects the game to continue to infinity even when a player has won at\nsome finite position; there is no interest in anything that happens\nafter a player has won. Many logical games have the property that in\nevery play, one of the players has already won at some finite\nposition; games of this sort are said to be well-founded. An\neven stronger condition is that there is some finite number \\(n\\) such\nthat in every play, one of the players has already won by the \\(n\\)-th\nposition; in this case we say that the game has finite\nlength.\n\nA strategy for a player is a set of rules that describe\nexactly how that player should choose, depending on how the two\nplayers have chosen at earlier moves. Mathematically, a strategy for\n\\(\\forall\\) consists of a function which takes each position\n\\(\\mathbf{a}\\) with \\(\\tau(\\mathbf{a}) = \\forall\\) to an element \\(b\\)\nof \\(\\Omega\\); we think of it as an instruction to \\(\\forall\\) to\nchoose \\(b\\) when the game has reached the position \\(\\mathbf{a}\\).\n(Likewise with a strategy for \\(\\exists\\).) A strategy for a player is\nsaid to be winning if that player wins every play in which he\nor she uses the strategy, regardless of what the other player does. At\nmost one of the players has a winning strategy (since otherwise the\nplayers could play their winning strategies against each other, and\nboth would win, contradicting that \\(\\W_{\\forall}\\) and\n\\(\\W_{\\exists}\\) have no plays in common). Occasionally one meets\nsituations in which it seems that two players have winning strategies\n(for example in the forcing games below), but closer inspection shows\nthat the two players are in fact playing different games.\n\nA game is said to be determined if one or other of the\nplayers has a winning strategy. There are many examples of games that\nare not determined, as Gale and Stewart showed in 1953 using the axiom\nof choice. This discovery led to important applications of the notion\nof determinacy in the foundations of set theory (see entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy).\n Gale and Stewart also proved an important theorem that bears their\nname: Every well-founded game is determined. It follows that every\ngame of finite length is determined\u2014a fact already known to\nZermelo in 1913. (A more precise statement of the Gale-Stewart theorem\nis this. A game \\(G\\) is said to be closed if \\(\\exists\\)\nwins every play of \\(G\\) in which she hasn\u2019t already lost at any\nfinite position. The theorem states that every closed game is\ndetermined. The proof of the theorem is basically easy: Let us call a\nposition winning for \\(\\forall\\) if he has a winning strategy starting\nfrom this position. Suppose \\(\\forall\\) does not have a winning\nstrategy in the game, that is, in the beginning the position is not\nwinning for \\(\\forall\\). If the first move is a move of \\(\\forall\\),\nafter his move the position is still not winning for him. If the first\nmove is a move of \\(\\exists\\), she must have a move after which the\nposition is still not winning for \\(\\forall\\), for otherwise the\nprevious position would have been winning for \\(\\forall\\). The game\ngoes on in this way infinitely many moves through positions which are\nnot winning for \\(\\forall\\). Because the game is closed, \\(\\exists\\)\nwins.)\n\nJust as in classical game theory, the definition of logical games\nabove serves as a clothes horse that we can hang other concepts onto.\nFor example it is common to have some laws that describe what elements\nof \\(\\Omega\\) are available for a player to choose at a particular\nmove. Strictly this refinement is unnecessary, because the winning\nstrategies are not affected if we decree instead that a player who\nbreaks the law loses immediately; but for many games this way of\nviewing them seems unnatural. Below we will see some other extra\nfeatures that can be added to games.\n\nThe definitions of game and strategy above were purely mathematical.\nSo they left out what is probably the single most important feature of\ngames, which is that people play them (at least metaphorically). The\nplayers aim to win, and by studying the strategies open to them we\nstudy what behaviour is rational for a person with a particular aim.\nIn most games there are several players, so we can study what is a\nrational response to somebody else\u2019s behaviour. By restricting\nthe players\u2019 moves and possible strategies, we can study bounded\nrationality, where an agent has to make rational decisions under\nconditions of limited information, memory or time. \n\nIn short, games are used for modelling rationality and bounded\nrationality. This is independent of any connection with logic. But\nsome logics were designed for studying aspects of rational behaviour,\nand in recent years it has become increasingly common to link these\nlogics to suitable games. See Section 5 (\u2018Semantic games for\nother logics\u2019) and its bibliography.\n\nBut until recently, logical games were connected with rational\nbehaviour in a quite different way. On the surface, the logic in\nquestion had no direct connection with behaviour. But logicians and\nmathematicians noticed that some ideas could be made more intuitive if\nthey were linked to possible aims. For example in many applications of\nlogical games, the central notion is that of a winning strategy for\nthe player \\(\\exists\\). Often these strategies (or their existence)\nturn out to be equivalent to something of logical importance that\ncould have been defined without using games\u2014for example a proof.\nBut games are felt to give a better definition because they quite\nliterally supply some motivation: \\(\\exists\\) is trying to win.\n\nThis raises a question that is not of much interest mathematically,\nbut it should concern philosophers who use logical games. If we want\n\\(\\exists\\)\u2019s motivation in a game \\(G\\) to have any explanatory\nvalue, then we need to understand what is achieved if \\(\\exists\\) does\nwin. In particular we should be able to tell a realistic story of a\nsituation in which some agent called \\(\\exists\\) is trying to do\nsomething intelligible, and doing it is the same thing as winning in\nthe game. As Richard Dawkins said, raising the corresponding question\nfor the evolutionary games of Maynard Smith,\n\nThe whole purpose of our search \u2026 is to discover a suitable\nactor to play the leading role in our metaphors of purpose. We\n\u2026 want to say, \u2018It is for the good of \u2026 \u2018.\nOur quest in this chapter is for the right way to complete that\nsentence. (The Extended Phenotype, Oxford University Press,\nOxford 1982, page 91.)\n\n\nFor future reference let us call this the Dawkins question.\nIn many kinds of logical game it turns out to be distinctly harder to\nanswer than the pioneers of these games realised. (Marion 2009\ndiscusses the Dawkins question further.)\n",
