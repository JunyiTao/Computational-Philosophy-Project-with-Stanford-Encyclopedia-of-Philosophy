    "main_text": "Defining Latinx Philosophy || Source vs. Subject Matter\n3.2 Source vs. Subject Matter\n\nOne might accept a narrower scope for the term \u201cLatinx\u201d,\nbut emphasis that the right understanding of \u201cLatinx\nphilosophy\u201d is defined in terms of the source of the\nphilosophical work, rather than its subject or content. That is, one\ncould accept that \u201cLatinx philosophy\u201d picks out Latinxs as\nconventionally understood, and treats Latinx philosophy as the\nphilosophy produced by that group, rather than being\nphilosophy about that group. This proposal would respect\nstandard usage of the term without denying that there can be important\nrelationships between Hispanic, Latin American, and Latinx philosophy.\nFurther, it would allow us to think of Latinx philosophy as an ethnic\nphilosophy, i.e., philosophy (whatever that is) that is produced by a\nspecific ethnos (whatever that comes to). One appeal to thinking of\nLatinx philosophy in this way\u2014as unified by its source (i.e.,\nLatinxs)\u2014is that it is continuous with other familiar ways of\ncharacterizing some parts of philosophy. That is, it is a familiar to\nthing to characterize some parts of philosophy in terms of their\nsource (e.g., Asian philosophy; German philosophy; European philosophy\netc.).\n\nHowever, a source-based characterization of Latinx philosophy remains\nat odds with current usage. Consider a Latina philosopher who spends\nher life work on the philosophy of quantum mechanics, or on set\ntheory, or on free will. Suppose she has no interest in social\nidentity and does not think of her work as in any way informed,\nconnected to, or directly relevant to Latinxs. On a source-based\naccount, she would nevertheless count as doing Latinx philosophy. This\nseems strange. Inverse cases generate infelicitous results as well.\nConsider a scholar who is not Latinx but who exclusively works on\nquestions of Latinx identity, the politics of Latinx immigration, and\ntopics in Latina feminism. On a source-based conception, such a\nscholar could not be said to be working on Latinx philosophy, at least\nnot in the sense under consideration.\n\nCurrent linguistic convention suggests that a subject-based\ncharacterization of the field is preferable. Construing the field as\ndefined by subject matter\u2014i.e., philosophy that is concerned\nwith Latinxs\u2014gets the right results in the cases mentioned\nabove. That is, non-Latinxs can do Latinx philosophy, and Latinxs can\ndo philosophy that isn\u2019t Latinx\n philosophy.[20]\n Moreover, subject-based approaches to defining a field is already\nfamiliar from our standard understandings of, for example, ethics,\nmetaphysics, and epistemology. To be sure, the appeal of a\nsubject-based characterization depends in large part on whether it\npicks out anything of interest. The body of work gestured at in this\nentry makes the case for that conception.\n\nWhy not pluralism, allowing for different construals of the scope and\ncontent of Latinx philosophy? In everyday discourse, we are prepared\nto allow that any number of terms admit of multiple meanings, picking\nout different, if sometimes overlapping things. In Southern\nCalifornia, \u201cMexican\u201d can refer to both Mexican nationals\nand to nth-generation US citizens descended from Mexican\n nationals.[21]\n Given the fact that many terms have multiple meanings, perhaps there\nis room for both a source-based and subject-based account of Latinx\nphilosophy? Perhaps there is. Still, there is reason to plump for a\nsingle privileged meaning in disciplinary contexts: labels and\ncharacterizations of a nascent subject matter are the public face of\nthe field. When a field is more mature and there are plenty of\nfamiliar and undisputed exemplars of it, the precise characterizations\nof a field is less pragmatically significant and more a matter of\ntaxonomical fussiness. In light of this, there seems to be at least\nsome reason to prefer to think of Latinx philosophy in terms of its\nsubject matter, i.e., as philosophy concerned in some substantive way\nwith Latinxs.\n",
