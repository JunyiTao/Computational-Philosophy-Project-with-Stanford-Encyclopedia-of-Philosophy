    "main_text": "Elements of Capacity || Understanding\n4.2 Understanding\n\nThe most basic mental element is understanding (Buchanan\n& Brock 1989: 23). Obviously, in order to be capable of consenting\nto or refusing a given intervention, a subject must have some basic\nunderstanding of the facts involved in that decision. Yet this\napparently simple requirement can turn out to be rather complex\ndepending on how \u201cunderstanding\u201d itself is defined (Drane\n1985). Basic comprehension and knowledge or cognition of facts is one\nminimal interpretation (Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 37\u201342).\nHowever, most commentators recognize that this level of mental ability\nis not enough for generating the sort of medical decisions we are\nconcerned with. On the other hand, the standard cannot be set too high\nlest we rule too many people incompetent (see inclusivity\n \u00a75.1).\n",
