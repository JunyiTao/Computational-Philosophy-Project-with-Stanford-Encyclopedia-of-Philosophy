    "main_text": "QBism || Decoherence\n1.5 Decoherence\n\nClassical mechanics is generally taken to be reducible to quantum\nmechanics, at least approximately in some appropriate limit. For\nexample, Newton\u2019s second law of motion is sometimes said to be\nderivable from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the limit of large\nmass. But to retrieve classical dynamics it is generally thought\nnecessary to supplement any such derivation with an account of why\nordinary macroscopic objects do not exhibit the interference behavior\ncharacteristic of quantum superpositions.\n\nQuantum models of environmental decoherence are commonly thought to\nprovide such an account (see entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics).\n These typically involve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, this time\napplied to a system in interaction with its quantum environment. The\napplication can show how interactions entangle the quantum states of\nsystem and environment in a way that selects a \u201cpointer\nbasis\u201d in which the system\u2019s reduced (mixed) state remains\nvery nearly diagonal indefinitely. Somehow a particular element of\nthis basis is supposed to be identifiable as the system\u2019s\nphysical state, evolving in a way that approximates classical\ndynamics.\n\nIf the Schr\u00f6dinger equation were a dynamical law governing the\nevolution of a physical quantum state this would provide a physical\nfoundation on which to base a reduction of classical dynamics to\nquantum dynamics that appealed to quantum decoherence. But QBists\ndeny that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a dynamical law\ngoverning the evolution of an objective quantum state. For them it\nmerely provides a constraint on an agent\u2019s current epistemic\nstate. Fuchs (2010,\n Other Internet Resources)\n concluded that decoherence has no role to play in the misguided\nprogram attempting to reduce classical to quantum dynamics.\n\nInstead, QBists Fuchs and Schack (2012) have viewed decoherence as a\ncondition on an agent\u2019s present assignment of a quantum state to\na system following one contemplated measurement, when making decisions\nregarding the possible outcomes of a second measurement. As such, it\nfunctions as a normative synchronic coherence condition that may be\nseen as a consequence of van Fraassen\u2019s (1984) Reflection\nPrinciple. Instead of taking decoherence to select possible outcomes\nof a physical measurement process, QBists take these to be just\nwhatever experiences may follow the agent\u2019s action on the\nworld.\n",
