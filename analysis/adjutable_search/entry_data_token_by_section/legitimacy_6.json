    "main_text": "Sources of Political Legitimacy || Consent\n3.1 Consent\n\nWhile there is a strong voluntarist line of thought in Christian\npolitical philosophy, it was in the 17th century that\nconsent came to be seen as the main source of political legitimacy.\nThe works of Hugo Grotius, Hobbes, and Samuel Pufendorf tend to be\nseen as the main turning point that eventually led to the replacement\nof natural law and divine authority theories of legitimacy (see\nSchneewind 1998; Hampton 1998). The following passage from\nGrotius\u2019 On the Law of War and Peace expresses the\nmodern perspective: \u201cBut as there are several Ways of Living,\nsome better than others, and every one may chuse which he pleases of\nall those Sorts; so a People may chuse what Form of Government they\nplease: Neither is the Right which the Sovereign has over his Subjects\nto be measured by this or that Form, of which divers Men have\ndifferent Opinions, but by the Extent of the Will of those who\nconferred it upon him\u201d (cited by Tuck 1993: 193). It was\nLocke\u2019s version of social contract theory that elevated consent\nto the main source of the legitimacy of political authority.\n\nRaz helpfully distinguishes among three ways in which the relation\nbetween consent and legitimate political authority may be understood\n(1995: 356): (i) consent of those governed is a necessary condition\nfor the legitimacy of political authority; (ii) consent is not\ndirectly a condition for legitimacy, but the conditions for the\nlegitimacy of authority are such that only political authority that\nenjoys the consent of those governed can meet them; (iii) the\nconditions of legitimate political authority are such that those\ngoverned by that authority are under an obligation to consent. There\nis a question, however, whether versions of (ii) and (iii) are best\nunderstood as versions of a consent theory of political legitimacy, or\nwhether they are versions of an alternative justificationist theory\n(Stark 2000; Peter 2023).\n\nLocke and his contemporary followers such as Robert Nozick (1974) or\nSimmons (2001), but also Rousseau and his followers defend a version\nof (i)\u2014the most typical form that consent theories take. Amanda\nGreene (2016) defends a version of this view she calls the quality\nconsent view. One question that all versions of (i) must address is\nwhether consent must be explicit or whether tacit consent, expressed\nby residency, is sufficient (see Puryear 2021 for a defence of the\nlatter).\n\nVersions of (ii) appeal to those who reject actual consent as a basis\nfor legitimacy, as they only regard consent given under ideal\nconditions as binding. Theories of hypothetical consent, such as those\narticulated by Kant or Rawls, fall into this category. Such theories\nview political authority as legitimate only if those governed would\nconsent under certain ideal conditions (cf. section 3.2).\n\nDavid Estlund (2008: 117ff) defends a version of hypothetical consent\ntheory that matches category (iii). What he calls \u201cnormative\nconsent\u201d is a theory that regards non-consent to authority,\nunder certain conditions as invalid. Authority, in this view, may thus\nbe justified without actual consent. Estlund defines authority as the\nmoral power to require action. Estlund uses normative consent theory\nas the basis for an account of democratic legitimacy, understood as\nthe permissibility of using coercion to enforce authority. The work\nthat normative consent theory does in Estlund\u2019s account is that\nit contributes to the justification of the authority of the democratic\ncollective over those who disagree with certain democratically\napproved laws.\n\nAlthough consent theory has been dominating for a long time, there are\nmany well-known objections to it. As we will explain more fully in the\nnext section, Simmons (2001) argues that hypothetical consent theories\n(and, presumably, normative consent theories, too) conflate moral\njustification with legitimation, and that only actual consent can\nlegitimize political institutions. Other objections, especially to\nLockean versions, are about as old as consent theory itself. David\nHume, in his essay \u201cOf the Original Contract\u201d, and many\nafter him object to Locke that consent is not feasible, and that\nactual states have almost always arisen from acts of violence. The\nattempt to legitimize political authority via consent is thus, at\nbest, wishful thinking (Wellman 1996). What is worse, it may obscure\nproblematic structures of subordination (Pateman 1988). Hume\u2019s\nown solution to this problem was, like Bentham later, to propose to\njustify political authority with reference to its beneficial\nconsequences (see section 3.3).\n",
