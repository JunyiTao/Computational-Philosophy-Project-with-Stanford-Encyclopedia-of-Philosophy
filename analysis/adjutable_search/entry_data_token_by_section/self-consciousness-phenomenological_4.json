    "main_text": "Intersubjective and social forms of self-consciousness\n5. Intersubjective and social forms of self-consciousness\n\nA focus on embodied self-experience inevitably leads to a decisive\nwidening of the discussion. The externality of embodiment puts me, and\nmy actions, in the public sphere. Self-consciousness, which involves\nan ability to make reflective judgments about our own beliefs and\ndesires, is always shaped by others and what we have learned from\nothers. This intersubjective or social influence can also affect\nprereflective self-consciousness, including my sense of embodied\nagency.\n\nI can become aware of myself through the eyes of other people, and\nthis can happen in several different ways. Thus, embodiment brings\nintersubjectivity and sociality into the picture, and draws attention\nto the question of how certain forms of self-consciousness are\nintersubjectively mediated or how they may depend on one\u2019s\nsocial relations to others. My awareness of myself as one person among\nothers, an awareness that I may frame from the perspective of others,\nattempting to see myself as they see me, involves a change in the\nattitude of self-consciousness. Within this attitude, judgments that I\nmake about myself are constrained by social expectations and cultural\nvalues. This kind of social self-consciousness is always\ncontextualized, as I try to understand how I appear to others, both in\nthe way I look, and in the meaning of my actions. I find myself in\nparticular contexts, with specific capabilities and dispositions,\nhabits and convictions, and I express myself in a way that is\nreflected off of others, in relevant (socially defined) roles through\nmy language and my actions.\n\nThe role of the other in this mode of self-consciousness is not\nunessential. According to Husserl, I become aware of myself\nspecifically as a human person only in such intersubjective relations\n(Husserl 1973b, 175; 1952, 204\u201305; see Hart 1992, 71; Zahavi\n1999, 157ff. Also see Taylor 1989, 34\u201336 for a similar idea).\nThus Husserl distinguishes the subject taken in its bare formality\nfrom the personalized subject and claims that the origin and status of\nbeing a person must be located in the social dimension. I am a person,\nsocially contextualized, with abilities, dispositions, habits,\ninterests, character traits, and convictions, all of which have been\ndeveloped through my interactions with others. When considering the\nfullness of human selfhood, the idea of an isolated, pure and formal\nsubject of experience is an abstraction (Husserl 1968, 210). Given the\nright conditions and circumstances, the self acquires a personalizing\nself-apprehension, i.e., it develops into a person and as a person\n(cf. Husserl 1952, 265). And this development depends heavily upon\nsocial interaction (Husserl 1973b, 170\u2013171).\n\nThis kind of self-consciousness also opens up the possibility of\nself-alienation, famously explicated by Sartre in terms of the\nother\u2019s gaze. For Sartre, because \u201cour being, along with\nits being-for-itself, is also for-others; the being which is revealed\nto the reflective consciousness is for-itself-for-others\u201d (1956,\n282). On this view, the primary experience of the other is not that I\nperceive her as some kind of object in which I must find a person, but\nI perceive the other as a subject who perceives me as an object. My\nexperience of the other is at the same time an experience that\ninvolves my own self-consciousness, a self-consciousness in which I am\nprereflectively aware that I am an object for another. This experience\ncan further motivate a reflective self-consciousness as I consider how\nI must appear to the other.\n\nMerleau-Ponty (1945, 415) suggests that the other\u2019s gaze can\nmotivate this kind of self-consciousness only if I already have a\nsense of my own visibility to the other. This sense of my own\nvisibility, however, is immediately linked with the prereflective,\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic sense of my body, an insight that goes\nback to Husserl\u2019s analysis (mentioned above). Merleau-Ponty\nnotes its connection to the infant\u2019s capability for imitation,\nand this is carried forward to more recent advances in developmental\npsychology (see Merleau-Ponty, 1945, 165, 404\u2013405; 2010;\nGallagher and Zahavi 2021; Zahavi 1999, 171\u201372). Indeed,\nalthough much emphasis has fallen on vision and the gaze of the other\nin phenomenological accounts of self-consciousness, proprioceptive and\ntactile experiences have a developmental primacy and emerge in the\npre-natal environment in ways that allow for very basic relational\nexperiences of self-movement versus movement of the mother\u2019s\nbody (Lymer 2010; 2014; Ciaunica & Crucianelli 2019; Ciaunica\n& Fotopoulou 2016), and continue to play a significant role in\nembodied interactions with caregivers during early infancy. In this\nrespect, the claim is that intersubjective/intercorporeal experiences\ncan affect prereflective self-consciousness Kyselo 2016; Ratcliffe\n2017). This complicates any claim that the prereflective experience of\nbody ownership is primarily for self-preservation (Ciaunica &\nCrucianelli 2019; de Vignemont 2018).\n\nThis is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion of these\nrich and complex issues, issues that extend to analyses of phenomena\nsuch as empathy, shame, guilt, and so on (see Zahavi 2010, 2014). But\nit is important to realize that self-consciousness is a multifaceted\nconcept. It is not something that can be exhaustively analyzed simply\nby examining the inner workings of the mind.\n",
