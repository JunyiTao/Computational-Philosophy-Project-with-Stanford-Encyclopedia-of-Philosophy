Physicians and nurses have long worried that patients who\nforgo life-sustaining treatment with the intention of dying are killing\nthemselves and that health professionals are assisting in their\nsuicide. These worries have recently receded in significance in\nbiomedical ethics, because there is now a consensus in law and ethics\n(in the U.S. and far beyond) that it is never a moral violation to\nwithhold or withdraw a medical treatment that has been validly refused.\nThis consensus began to be developed with the case of Karen Ann Quinlan\nin 1976 and eventually was formed around U. S. Supreme Court decisions,\nespecially the Cruzan Case of 1990. The writings of numerous\nphilosophers and lawyers contributed to the formation of this\nconsensus. A clear part of the consensus is that it is a moral\nviolation not to withhold or withdraw a validly refused\nlife-sustaining treatment. If death is hastened in this way by\na physician\u2019s omission or action, there can be no moral objection to\nwhat has been done, and a physician\u2019s cooperation can rightly be viewed\nas merciful and benevolent.\n\n\nHowever, this problem has been replaced by another: Is it harmful or\nbeneficial to help a competent patient who has requested help in\ncausing a hastened death? In addition to vexed questions about\nthe purported distinction between killing and letting die, this issue\npresses the question of what counts as a benefit and what counts as a\nharm. Is requested death in the face of miserable suffering a benefit\nfor some patients while a harm caused to other patients? When is it a\nbenefit, and when a harm? Is the answer to this question determined by\nthe method used to bring about death--for example, withdrawal of\ntreatment by contrast to use of lethal medication?\n",
