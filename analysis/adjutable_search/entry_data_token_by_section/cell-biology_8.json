Instead of defining what\nphenomena are, they give examples: \u201cweak neutral currents, the\ndecay of the proton, and chunking and recency effects in human\nmemory\u201d (1988: 306). From these examples, it is clear that Bogen\nand Woodward understand phenomena to be repeatable processes that can\nbe observationally or experimentally detected in multiple ways. On\nthis characterization, cell activities such as protein synthesis or\ncell division count as cellular phenomena. Although phenomena are\noften construed as the starting point of research, Craver and Darden\n(2013: Chapter 4) identify some of the experimental tasks involved in\ncharacterizing phenomena such as identifying precipitating conditions,\nmanifestations, inhibiting conditions, modulating conditions, and\nnonstandard conditions that alter the manifestation of the phenomenon.\nThey also emphasize the role of multiple experimental techniques in\nspecifying features of phenomena. A good deal of research in cell\nbiology is devoted to determining conditions under which cell\nphenomena such as programmed cell death are initiated or inhibited and\ncell biologists have been inventive in developing experimental\ntechniques needed to produce these phenomena. Bechtel (forthcoming)\npoints out that phenomena that are the target of explanation range\nfrom highly specific (protein synthesis in liver cells under low\noxygen conditions) to much more general (protein synthesis\ngenerically). Individual research projects often address highly\nspecific phenomena whereas textbooks or review articles discuss more\ngeneral phenomena.\n\nWhile some account of the phenomenon under study is generally adopted\nbefore researchers set out to identify the responsible mechanism, the\ncharacterization often changes radically as research on the\nresponsible mechanism proceeds (Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010],\nrefer to researchers reconstituting the phenomenon). This is\nillustrated with an example from the study of cells. A starting point\nfor early inquiries into how animals store energy for their activities\nfocused on the heat generated by metabolizing foodstuffs. This heat\nwas assumed to power other activities and approximately a hundred\nyears of research was devoted to explaining animal heat (see\nMendelsohn 1964). However, after Lohmann (1929) and Fiske and Subbarow\n(1929) had identified adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and demonstrated\nthat when hydrolyzed it would release considerable energy, heat was\ndetermined to be just a waste product of metabolism and researchers\ninstead focused on the synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP. This became\nthe reconstituted phenomenon to which much of the older research was\nnow applied.\n",
