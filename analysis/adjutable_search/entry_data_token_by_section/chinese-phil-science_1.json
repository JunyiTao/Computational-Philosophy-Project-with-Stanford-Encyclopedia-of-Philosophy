    "main_text": "Joseph Needham's History of Science in China\n2. Joseph Needham's History of Science in China\n\nThe question of the relation of Chinese philosophy and science is\ncomplicated by several factors. One is the need to define what we mean\nby science in the context of early China and early Chinese\nphilosophy. This question includes the relationship of\n\u201cscience\u201d to \u201ctechnology,\u201d as well as the\nquestion of what disciplines were considered sciences, and where they\nstood in indigenous hierarchies of knowledge.\n\nThese questions partake of an ongoing debate on the nature of\nChinese science, which initially arose from the pioneering work of\nJoseph Needham. This debate focuses on the problematic question\nof why (or whether) the revolution that transformed scientific\ndisciplines in Europe did not take place in China. It has tended\nto focus on the mathematization of science and on the activities of\ncourt astronomical officials (Needham 1956b, 1979). But these debates\ndo little to clarify the relations between the origins and development\nof the sciences in China and Chinese philosophy.\n\nThis debate about the nature of Chinese science, which has been\nreferred to as the \u201cNeedham problem,\u201d has focused on\nvariants on the important question of why (or whether) the scientific\nrevolution that transformed scientific disciplines in Europe did not\ntake place in China. In Needham's terms, the answers lie in the history\nof Chinese science itself, but Fung Yu-lan's argument provides an\nanswer of a very different kind, which Needham would probably not\nentertain at all. (Although Needham's (1956b) own account of the\nhistory of Chinese philosophy and science repeatedly cites the\nscholarship of Fung Yu-lan, especially Fung 1983, he makes no mention\nof Fung 1922.)\n\nNeedham, himself an eminent embryologist (Needham 1931, 1934) was\nthe primary author of the multi-volume ongoing Science and\nCivilisation in China (1954- ). His approach to the problem\nof the history of science in China was to try to fit the Chinese\nscientific tradition into the categories of twentieth-century western\nscience. On the one hand, this approach enabled Needham and his\ncollaborators to engage the wealth and variety of the many Chinese\nsciences from a perspective that took them seriously as contributors to\nan ongoing and universal history of science. This approach also\nallowed Needham's group to consistently and coherently refute\n\u201corientalist\u201d claims or prima facie assumptions that\nscience was the sole property of a European tradition extending\nbackward in time to ancient Greece, with little or no influence from\nany other cultural tradition. On the other hand, Needham's\n\u201cuniversalist\u201d approach to the history of science in China\nhas been rejected as anachronistic and culturally inappropriate (Yates\n2003, 658).\n\nAs Nathan Sivin (1990 and 1995) has argued, Chinese accounts focused\non specific sciences, rather than on one unified notion of science.\nThese Chinese sciences were both quantitative and qualitative. Sivin\n(1982 and 1990) breaks down the quantitative sciences into three\ndisciplines: mathematics (suan \u7b97), mathematical\nharmonics or acoustics (l\u00fc \u5f8b or l\u00fc\nl\u00fc \u5f8b\u5442) and mathematical astronomy (li\n\u6b77 or li fa \u6b77\u6cd5), considered related to\nharmonics. Sivin describes the qualitative sciences as: astronomy\nor astrology (tian wen \u5929\u6587), medicine\n(yi \u91ab) and siting (feng shui\n\u98a8\u6c34). Tian wen included the observation of\ncelestial and meteorological events whose proper reading could be used\nto rectify the political order. Medicine included \u201cNurturing\nLife\u201d (yang sheng \u990a\u751f), a broad category\nthat included a wide range of self-cultivation techniques with\nimportant philosophical implications. In later periods, medicine also\nincluded materia medica (ben cao \u672c\u8349) and\ninternal (nei dan \u5167\u4e39) and external (wai\ndan \u5916\u4e39) alchemy.\n",
