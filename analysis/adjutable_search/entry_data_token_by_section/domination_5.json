    "main_text": "Does Domination Require the Exercise of Power? || Over-Generalization Problems for Structure-Based Accounts\n3.3 Over-Generalization Problems for Structure-Based Accounts\n\nOver-generalization worries are the most common objection to\nneorepublican approaches to domination. If domination is just the\ncapacity for arbitrary interference, and given that such\ncapacities seem ubiquitous, domination may be ordinary to the point of\ntriviality. Even when sitting around minding their own business,\nphysically strong people have the capacity to overpower weaker people;\neven if they never do, people with a natural gift for persuasion have\nthe capacity to talk the gullible out of their savings (Friedman 2008:\n251). Also, if the primary function of the state is to minimize\ndomination, neorepublicanism suggests that the state should try to\nmake people less strong or less persuasive in order to reduce their\ncapacity for arbitrary interference. That is unsavory. An obvious fix\nis to insist that only \u201cactual or attempted arbitrary\ninterference\u201d dominates (Friedman 2008: 252).\n\nFor some feminists, the over-generalization worry is specifically that\nneorepublicans make relationships of care and dependency unreasonably\nsuspect. A caregiver who would not dream of harming their charges\nnevertheless has the capacity to: infecting wounds instead of cleaning\nthem, throwing someone down the stairs instead of helping them up\n(Friedman 2008: 254). Pettit acknowledges this feature of his theory\nwhen he claims that caring and uncaring mothers\u2014and presumably\ncaring and uncaring fathers\u2014alike dominate their children in a\nstate of nature (Pettit 1999: 119\u2013120). The alternative is to\ninsist that though care providers may stand in a relationship of\nunequal power with a vulnerable dependent, unless this power is abused\nit does not dominate. Domination, instead of mere power, requires\nactive violation of moral standards and/or compromising the best\ninterests of others (Kittay 1999: 33\u201334).\n\nThe attractiveness of this alternate depends on how we understand\npowers or capacities. If A has a power or capacity to interfere\nso long as it is possible in any sense for A to do so,\nas Pettit sometimes suggests, criticism focusing on the value of care\nis damaging: clearly, it is [e.g.] physically possible for caregivers\nand parents to interfere with their dependents. If, however, A\ndoes not have the power to interfere so long as appropriate penalties\nare in place for such interference, the objection may not be so\npotent. In other words, it\u2019s not mere possibility that matters,\nbut social or legal possibility\u2014roughly, what it is possible to\ndo without risk of sanction from other members of your social group or\nby agents of the state (see List & Valentini 2016). A hallmark of feminist\nethics and political philosophy has been the insistence that power\nrelations inside the home often manifest domination, even though the\nhome can be a center of loving care and dependence, and that legal\nregulation\u2014against spousal abuse or child neglect\u2014might\nreduce that domination (Costa 2013: 928). Such laws, of course, do not\nmake interference impossible simpliciter; instead, it makes\ninterference risky and potentially costly.\n\nAlso, shifting from domination as mere power to domination as abuse of\npower may lead to other unattractive results, especially given broadly\nfeminist commitments. If domination requires actual or attempted\ninterference, women who avoid interference by \u201cseduction,\ningratiation, [or] avoidance\u201d will not count as dominated (Costa\n2013: 926). This feature of neorepublican accounts\u2014the\ninsistence that domination is the \u201cmere condition of being\nvulnerable\u201d\u2014may be exactly what makes the concept useful\nfor feminist philosophy (Laborde 2008: 152).\n\nThere are other proposed counter-examples to the claim that the\n\u201ccapacity to interfere \u2026 at will\u201d dominates\n(Shapiro 2016: 21). What about \u201ca playground bully\u201d who is\n\u201cable to beat up any of the smaller children but is widely known\nonly to beat up black children\u201d? Does the bully dominate the\nwhite children just as much as the black children? What about someone\nlike 1950s American senator Joseph McCarthy? He had the same power to\ninterfere in the lives of right-wing and left-wing Americans; but\ncitizens on the left had far more reason to fear him. Perhaps the\nintuitive judgment here is that the bully only dominates the black\nchildren, and that McCarthy only dominates left-wing citizens. (Both\nexamples are from Ian Shapiro 2012: 324; 2016: 21). It should be\nnoted, however, that the persuasiveness of these examples depends in\npart on whether we think domination is the sole political evil, at\nleast in the sense that all other political evils can be addressed\nmost effectively by minimizing domination. The black children and the\nleft-wing citizens in Shapiro\u2019s examples are obviously worse off\nthan the white children/right-wing citizens. If we diagnose their\ncondition only by appeal to the evil of domination, Shapiro\u2019s\nexamples are damaging to the idea that domination can be an\nunexercised power. This is true even though there may not be much\npractical space between Shapiro\u2019s account of domination and\nPettit\u2019s, given that Shapiro speaks of complaints against\ndomination as complaints against a \u201cpower relationship\u201d.\nInterestingly, Shapiro emphasizes the possibility that someone may be\nvulnerable to domination without being dominated, and that\nvulnerability to domination\u2014like domination itself\u2014is\nmorally significant and represents an injustice (2016: 22). While the\nidea of domination as vulnerability recurs in the\nneorepublican literature, there is relatively little examination of\nthis intermediate category: those who are vulnerable to domination\nwithout being dominated. (Perhaps the closest consideration in\nPettit\u2019s work is his brief discussion of \u201cvirtual\ndomination\u201d in 1997: 54.)\n\nThe controversy about whether completely dormant power can dominate\ncontinues, but there is broad consensus that you can be dominated even\nif nobody is actively dominating you at the moment. Even if\nthere is no domination without an actual display of power over you or\npeople like you at some time, domination might persist when\nunexercised precisely because of its previous exercise. As Wartenberg\n(1990) says, the actual exercise of power can \u201ccondition\u201d\na social relationship in a \u201clongstanding\u201d manner. If power\nhas been exercised over you in the past, or over someone like you\n(perhaps because you are both members of a subordinated social group),\nthis will affect how you relate to those in power. For example,\nsuppose you know that the boss can fire you at will. He has not fired\nyou or even threatened to do so, and so has not actually exercised his\npower over you. Even so, you have seen him exercise this power over\nother employees. As a result, you do whatever you\u2019re told for\nfear of what the boss can do to you and has done to\nothers. This motivates the view that your domination does not require\nthe active exercise of power against you even though it might require\nthe active exercise of power against someone relevantly like\nyou. Of course, this leads to further questions: e.g., How recent must\nactive exercises of power be in order to condition ongoing social\nrelationships where power is dormant? Such questions have received\nrelatively little attention thus far (but see Hirschmann 2003). \n",
