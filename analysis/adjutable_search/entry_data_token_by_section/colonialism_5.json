Recognition and Revolt in Settler-Colonial States \n\nIndigenous scholars have articulated a critique of post-colonialism,\nnoting that the concept obscures the continued existence of settler\ncolonialism. Decolonization within setter states is framed through an\nethics of reconciliation, which recognizes the historical and ongoing\neffects of colonization and aims at establishing a mutually respectful\nframework for a sustainable nation to nation relationship between\nsettler and Indigenous peoples. The theoretical literature on settler\ncolonialism includes a diverse range of positions that offer different\nassessments of approaches focused on reconciliation and resurgence. A\npoint of controversy in contemporary Indigenous political theory\nliterature is the extent to which it is desirable to participate in\ncolonial and political institutions in order to transform them. A\ncentral tension that underlies this controversy is whether\ninstitutional accommodation aimed toward reconciliation advanced an\nidea of self-determination that is defined through Indigenous\ninterests, cosmologies, and ethics or further reproduces the\nconditions of domination that only perpetuate the historical\nsettler-colonial relationship.\n\nScholars such as Dale Turner suggests that it is possible to achieve\nsuccessful reconciliation through Western practices of democratic\ndeliberation and procedures. In This is Not a Peace Pipe: Toward a\nCritical Indigenous Philosophy (2006), Turner emphasizes that the\nway to undermine the power dynamics that perpetuate the conditions of\ncolonialism is through participation within the legal and political\ninstitutions of the state. He argues that \u201cword warriors,\u201d\nwho mediate between Indigenous communities and legal and political\ninstitutions, should ensure the preservation and expansion of\nIndigenous rights within the larger community. Turner further suggests\nthat an effective relationship between settler states and Indigenous\npeoples will only emerge from a dialogue grounded in democratic\npresumptions of equality and respect. This dialogue entails that\nIndigenous peoples, in order to establish claims of cultural\ndistinctiveness, must learn how to engage within settler states\u2019\nlegal and political discourses in more effective ways (2006:5).\n\nIn their essay \u201cDecolonization is Not a Metaphor\u201d (2012)\nEve Tuck and Wayne Yang criticize settler worldviews for failing to\nacknowledge the distinct, totalizing effect of settler colonialism.\nThey emphasize that settler colonialism operates through the\nexploitation and expropriation of Indigenous worlds by privileging\ncolonial economies while simultaneously involving the use of\nparticularized modes of control, such as schools and policing, to\nensure and legitimize progress and development in accordance with\nsettler epistemologies and ontologies. In this sense,\nsettler-colonialism is a structure rather than an event (Wolfe 1999)\nthat reinforces the total appropriation of Indigenous life and land.\nTuck and Yang describe contemporary approaches to reconciliation as\n\u201cmoves to innocence\u201d that reconcile settler guilt while\nsecuring the future of settler colonialism.\n\nA prominent idea that is brought up in the struggle for Indigenous\nself-determination is the Doctrine of Discovery. Settlers claimed\ndiscovery from the normative political and legal view of terra\nnullius, which translates to \u201cempty land.\u201d Scholars\nof Indigenous resurgence argue that doctrines of discovery and terra\nnullius persist in the present period within recognition-based methods\nof reconciliation, and they stifle movements of self-determination.\nTheorists of Indigenous resurgence advance an understanding of\ndecolonization that refuses contemporary settler-colonial methods of\ninstitutional and cultural accommodation while reviving Indigenous\nlegal and political institutions and ways of being. Leanne\nBetasamosake Simpson points out that rebuilding needs to start from\nwithin, and Indigenous people require not only the re-establishment of\npre-colonial history and languages but also the introduction of\nIndigenous custom and forms of governance that re-center a grounded\nnormativity, which is a norm guided by ancestral land-based\nrelationships and practices. This can build on the oral tradition of\nstorytelling, which is a framework that informs social experience.\nMost recently, in Short History of Blockades (2021) Simpson\nargues that practices of blockading represent both a negation of\nsettler colonial states and the affirmation or amplification of\nIndigenous futurity that directly addresses the implications of\ncontinual dispossession and domination by rebuilding relations of\nself-determination.\n\nIn Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of\nRecognition (2014), Glen Coulthard deepens the theoretical\nframework of resurgence and refusal by arguing that the current\nframework of reconciliation tends to dehistoricize and neutralize acts\nof dispossession, violence, and displacement of Indigenous peoples\nfrom their lands and culture. For Coulthard, settler colonialism is an\nongoing process emergent in settler institutions and structures of\nrecognition, not merely the legacy of past injustices. This is evident\nin unsettled land claims, the dispossession of land, the limitations\nplaced on Indigenous governments, and the displacement of Indigenous\nways of life that are tied to access to traditional territories.\nRather than relying on recognition from within the colonial-settler\nrelationship, Coulthard calls for an Indigenous sovereignty informed\nby an intellectual, social, political, and artistic movement that\nembodies a \u201cself-reflective revitalization\u201d of traditional\nvalues, principles, and cultural practices.\n\nThe title of Coulthard\u2019s book alludes to Black Skin, White\nMasks (2008), the path breaking work by Frantz Fanon. Writing in\n1950s, Fanon challenged the abstract universalism of Western\nphilosophy, showing how universalism serves to structure a\nhierarchical relationship between settler and colonized. Fanon\u2019s\ncritical theory challenges the assumption that European notions of\nprogress truly advance justice and secure mutual benefit. In Black\nSkin, White Masks, Fanon focuses on the development of Black\nconsciousness by exploring the psychological alienation and\ndisplacement caused by colonial domination. He describes a divided\nself who identifies with French culture even while experiencing\nexclusion from the ideals of universalism, equality, and reason.\nCoulthard\u2019s reading of Fanon informs his view that cultural\nrecognition by the colonial state is not a solution. Following Fanon,\nhe concludes the paternalist recognition serves to legitimize the\ncolonial state and further divide Indigenous subjects.\n\nWhile international recognition-based models have gained momentum\nsince the 2007 United Nations Declaration of Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples (UNDRIP), their potential to establish Indigenous sovereignty\nand self-determination remains contested. Scholars such as Sheryl\nLightfoot (2016) highlight the revolutionary potential of\ninternational movements to enable a collective voice where local\nstruggles may strategically coalesce on a global platform. Others are\ncritical of UNDRIP as it remains formulated within a Westphalian\nsystem that fails to universally recognize the sovereignty of\nIndigenous law and practices in cases where it conflicts with settler\nlaw or territorial sovereignty (see Hayden King).\n\nIn her book Restructuring Relations: Indigenous\nSelf-Determination, Governance, and Gender (2019) Rauna Kuokkanen\nis skeptical of the ability of human rights frameworks, such as\nUNDRIP, to inform and express Indigenous self-determination. Drawing\nfrom Indigenous and feminist political and legal theory, Kuokkanen\nhighlights the way human rights frameworks and current models of\nIndigenous self-government are limited in their ability to adequately\naddress violence against women because of their focus on civil and\npolitical rights. As an alternative, Kuokkanen proposes a relational\ntheory of self-determination that recognizes that social and political\norders as interconnected and interdependent, which she contrasts with\na rights-based framework that fosters values of autonomy. Kuokkanen\npositions self-determination as a core value and traces the way\ncertain ideas and rights of self-determination both structure social\nand political experience and how this value could be transformed if\ninformed and developed through Indigenous ontologies based on the idea\nof integrity of both the land and the body alongside a freedom from\nbodily harm and violence.\n\nResurgence scholars aim to unsettle settler perspectives of\ncivilization through the revitalisation of Indigenous practices of\nresponsibility and relations with the natural world. Theorists within\nthis field reject all stadial theories of human development and the\nidea that history\u2019s direction is irreversible. Similar to\nGandhi, some Indigenous thinkers critique modern civilization as a\nprofound sickness destroying what is meaningful in human life,\ncharacterizing modern civilization as ailing and on the threshold of\nself-destruction (Henderson, 2017). These thinkers challenge the idea\nof a single authoritative account of politics guided by the ideas of\nEnlightenment rationality. Instead, they make a case for a new way of\ndoing politics that provides an alternative to the materialism and\nconsumerism of modern Western societies that develops through a close\nstudy of the values destroyed through colonialism. John Borrows\n(2008), for example, challenges settler understandings that shape\nhuman relationships and obligations to the earth by re-telling the\nidea of seven generations that exists in many Indigenous legal and\npolitical traditions. According to this approach, when making\njudgments in the present, we have duties of obligation to seven\ngenerations in the past and seven generations in the future.\n\nAlong the lines of colonial and post-colonial thinkers, like Gandhi,\nAim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Fanon, Indigenous political theorists do\nnot necessarily advocate for a reversion to historical or traditional\nways of living. Rather, Indigenous thinkers describe a new humanism\nwithin the context of settler colonialism that requires politics\nguided by a practice of truth-seeking from various perspectives. In\ntheir work Resurgence and Reconciliation: Indigenous-Settler\nRelations and Earth Teachings (2019), Michael Ash, John Borrows,\nand James Tully compile a collection of work that brings forward a\ntheoretical framework of reconciliation that is empowered by practices\nof resurgence. Decolonization in this sense is likened to the activity\nof the ancient sweetgrass braiders, which brings various independent\nstrands of branches, roots, filaments and fibre together in a strong\nbraid. This act of weaving \u2013 a predominantly female\napprenticeship \u2013 necessitates a deep understanding of\ncommunity life and its history, with a knowledge of patterns,\nimpressions, and conventions in both the natural and human world\n(2019:10).\n\nIndigenous political theory has developed into a robust scholarship\nthat calls for the radical responsibility of Indigenous nations for\ntheir own self-determination. This scholarship advocates for the\nemergence of a new set of values that develops not through privileging\na European conception of universalism but by sketching a conception of\nuniversalism that emerges from the co-existence of many particulars.\nThis emergent universalism assembles different worlds and ideas of\ncivilization by addressing issues surrounding land rights and cultural\ndistinctiveness.\n",
