    "main_text": "Arguments for the Innateness of Language || The Argument from the \u2018Unlearning Problem\u2019\n2.3 The Argument from the \u2018Unlearning Problem\u2019\n\n\nWe saw in the previous section that in order to support the view that\nall of UG is innately known, nativists about language need to hold \nnot just that the data for language learning is impoverished in a few\nisolated instances, but that it's impoverished across the board. That\nis, in order to support the view that the innate contribution to \nlanguage acquisition is something as rich and detailed as knowledge \nof Universal Grammar, nativists must hold that the inputs to language\nacquisition are defective in many and widespread cases. (After all, \nif the inputs were degenerate only in a few isolated instances, such \nas those discussed above, the learning problem could be solved simply\nby positing innate knowledge of a few relevant linguistic hints, \nrather than all of UG.)\n\n\nPullum and Scholz (2002:13) helpfully survey a number of ways in \nwhich nativists have made this point, including:\n\nFiniteness: the pld (primary linguistic data) are finite,\nwhereas languages contain infinitely many sentences.\nUnderdetermination: the pld are always compatible with\ninfinitely many grammatical hypotheses.\nDegeneracy: the pld contain ungrammatical and incomplete\nsentences.\nIdiosyncrasy: different children learning the same language are\nexposed to different samples of sentences.\nPositivity: the pld contain only positive instances (what\nis a sentence of the language to be learned, a.k.a. the\n\u2018target language\u2019).\nNo Feedback: children are not told or rewarded when they get\nthings right, and are not corrected when they make mistakes.\n\n\n\nIn this section, I will set aside features (i) and (ii) as being \ncharacteristic of any empirical domain: the data are \nalways finite, and they always underdetermine one's\ntheory. No doubt it's an important problem for epistemologists and \nphilosophers of science to explain how general theories can \nnonetheless be confirmed and believed. No doubt, too, it's an \nimportant problem for psychologists to explain the mechanisms by \nwhich individuals acquire general knowledge about the world on the \nbasis of their experience. But underdetermination and the finiteness \nof the data are everyone's problem: if these features of the language\nlearning situation per se supported nativism, then we should accept \nthat all learning, in every domain, requires inborn domain-specific \nknowledge. But while it's not impossible that everything we know that\ngoes beyond the data is a result of our having domain-specific innate\nknowledge, this view is so implausible as to warrant no further \ndiscussion here.\n\n\nI also set aside features (iii) and (iv). For one thing, it is \nunclear exactly how degenerate the pld are; according to one\nearly estimate, an impressive 99.7% of utterances of mothers to their\nchildren are grammatically impeccable (Newport, Gleitman and \nGleitman 1977). And even if the data are messier than this figure \nsuggests, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the vast weight of \ngrammatically well-formed utterances would easily swamp any residual \nnoise. As to the idiosyncrasy of different children's data sets, this\nis not so much a matter of stimulus poverty as stimulus difference. \nAs such, idiosyncrasy becomes a problem for a non-nativist only on \nthe assumption that different children's states of linguistic \nknowledge differ from one another less than one would expect given \nthe differences in their experiences. As far as I know, no serious \ncase for this last claim has ever been \n made.[12]\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will focus on features (v) and (vi) of the \npld. For it is consideration of the positivity of the data \nset, and the lack of feedback available to children, that has given \nrise to what I am calling the \u2018Unlearning Problem,\u2019 \notherwise known (somewhat misleadingly) as the \u2018Logical Problem\nof Language Acquisition.\u2019 (For statements of the argument, see,\ne.g., Baker 1979; Lasnik; 1989:89-90; Pinker 1989.)\n\n\nFigure 2.  Five possible relations between the language generated\nby hypothesis (H) and the target grammar (L)\n\n\n\nTake a child learning the grammar of her language, L. \nFigure 2 represents the 5 possible relations that \nmight obtain between the language generated by her current \nhypothesis, H, and that generated by the target grammar, \nL. (v) represents the end point of the learning process: the\nlearner has figured out the correct grammar for her language. A \nlearner in situation (i), (ii) or (iii) is in good shape, for she can\neasily use the pld as a basis for correcting her hypothesis \nas follows: whenever she encounters a sentence in the data (i.e., a \nsentence of L) that is not generated by H, she has \nto \u2018expand\u2019 her hypothesis so that it generates that \nsentence. In this way, H will keep moving, as desired, towards \nL. However, suppose that the learner finds herself in \nsituation (iv), where her hypothesis generates all of the target \nlanguage, L, and more besides. (Children frequently find \nthemselves in this position, for example, they invariably go through \na phase in which they overgeneralize regular past tense verb endings \nto irregular verbs; their grammars generate the incorrect *I \nbreaked it as well as the correct I broke it.) There, \nshe is in deep trouble, for she cannot use the pld to \ndiscover her error. Every sentence of L, after all, is \nalready a sentence of H. In order to \u2018shrink\u2019 \nher hypothesis \u2014 to \u2018unlearn\u2019 the rules that \ngenerate *I breaked it \u2014 she needs to know which \nsentences of H are not sentences of L \u2014 she \nneeds to figure out that *I breaked it is not a sentence of \nEnglish. But \u2014 and this is the problem \u2014 this kind of \nevidence, often called \u2018negative evidence,\u2019 is held to be\nunavailable to language learners.\n\n\nFor as we have seen, the pld is mostly just a sample of \nsentences, of positive instances of the target language. It contains \nlittle, if any, information about strings of words that are not \nsentences. For instance, children aren't given lists of ungrammatical\nstrings. Nor are they typically corrected when they make mistakes. \nAnd nor can they simply assume that strings that haven't made their \nway into the sample are ungrammatical: there are infinitely many \nsentences that are absent from the data for the simple reason that \nno-one's had occasion to say them yet.\n\n\nIn sum: a child who is in situation (iv) \u2014 a child whose \ngrammar \u2018overgenerates\u2019 \u2014 would need negative \nevidence in order to recover from her error. Negative evidence, \nhowever, does not appear to exist. Since children do manage to learn \nlanguages, they must never get themselves into situation (iv): they \nmust never need to \u2018unlearn\u2019 any grammatical rules. There\nare two ways they could do this. One would be never to generalize \nbeyond the data at all. But clearly, children do generalize, else \nthey'd never succeed in learning a language. The other would be if \nthere were something that ensured that when they generalize \nbeyond the data, they don't overgeneralize, something, that \nis, that ensures that children don't make errors that they could only\ncorrect on the basis of negative evidence. According to the \nlinguistic nativist, this something is innate knowledge of UG.\n2.3.1 Criticisms of the \u2018Unlearning\u2019 Argument\n2.3.1 (a) What is lacking? Negative data vs. Negative Evidence\n\n\nFirst, let's make a distinction between:\n\nNegative Data: explicit information that a given string of\nwords is not a sentence of the target language. (E.g., \u201cNo,\nthat's not how you say it,\u201d or \u201cIt's I broke it\nnot I breaked it,\u201d or \u201cThat string of words is\nungrammatical,\u201d etc.)\n\n\nand\n\nNegative Evidence: information that would enable a learner to\ntell that a given hypothesis is (very likely to be) incorrect. (See\nbelow for examples.)\n\n\nSecond, let's abandon the idea, which reappears in many presentations\nof the Argument from the Unlearning Problem; that learners' \nhypotheses must be explicitly falsified in the data in order to be \nrejected. Let's suppose instead that learners proceed more like \nactual scientists do \u2014 provisionally abandoning theories due to\nlack of confirmation, making theoretical inferences to link data with\ntheories, employing statistical information, and making defeasible, \nprobabilistic (rather than decisive, all-or-nothing) judgments as to \nthe truth or falsity of their \n theories.[13]\n\n\n\nIntuitively, viewing the learner as employing more stochastic and \nprobabilistic inductive techniques enables one to see how the \nunlearning problem might have been overblown. What the argument \nclaims, rightly, is that negative data near enough do not \nexist in the pld. However, what learners need in order to \nrecover from overgeneralizations, is not negative data per \nse, but negative evidence, and arguably, the \npld do contain significant amounts of that. For example:\n\nFailures of understanding or communication: others'\nfailures to understand children's linguistic productions (evidenced\neither by requests for repetition or by communicative failure) are\nevidence to the learner that there is something wrong with the rule(s)\nshe was using to generate her utterance. This evidence is not decisive\n(maybe Granny just couldn't hear her properly), but it is negative\nevidence nonetheless.\n\nNon-occurrence of structural types as negative evidence: \nSuppose that a child's grammar predicted that a certain string is \npart of the target language. Suppose further that that string never \nappears in the data, even when the context seems appropriate. \nProponents of the unlearning problem say that non-occurrence cannot \nconstitute negative evidence \u2014 maybe Dad simply always chooses \nto say The girl who is in the jumping castle is Kayley's \ndaughter, isn't she? rather than the auxiliary-fronted version, \nIs the girl who is in the jumping castle Kayley's daughter? \nIf so, it would be a mistake for the child to conclude on the basis \nof this information that the latter string is ungrammatical.\n\n\nBut suppose that the child is predicting not strings of words, \nsimpliciter, but rather strings of words under a certain\nsyntactic description (or, perhaps more plausibly, \nquasi-syntactic description \u2014 the categories employed need not \nbe the same as those employed in adult \n grammars).[14]\n This would enable her to make much better use of non-occurrence as \nnegative evidence. For non-occurring strings will divide into two \nbroad kinds: those whose structures have been encountered \nbefore in the data, and those whose structures have not been\nheard before. In the former case, the child has positive evidence \nthat strings of that kind are grammatical, evidence that would enable\nher to suppose that the non-occurrence of that particular string was \njust an accident. (E.g., she could reason that since she's heard \nIs that mess that is on the floor in there yours? many \ntimes, and since that string has the same basic structure as Is \nthat girl that's in the jumping castle Kayley's daughter?, the \nlatter string is probably OK even though Dad chose not to say it.)\n\n\nIn the case in which the relevant form has never been \nencountered before in the data, however, the child is better off: the\nfact that she has never heard any utterance with the structure of \n*Is that girl who in the jumping castle is Kayley's daughter\nor *Is that mess that that on the floor in there is yours? \nis evidence that strings of that type are not sentences. Again, the \nevidence is not decisive, and the child should be prepared to revise \nher grammar should strings of that kind start appearing. Nonetheless,\nthe non-occurrence of a string, suitably interpreted in the light of \nother linguistic information, can constitute negative evidence and \nprovide learners with reason to reject overgeneral grammars.\n\n\nPositive Evidence as Negative Evidence. Relatedly, learners \ncan also exploit positive evidence as to which strings occur in the \npld as a source of negative evidence \u2014 again in a \ntentative and revisable \n way.[15]\n Suppose that the child's grammar generated two strings as appropriate\nin a given kind of context, but that only one sort of string was ever\nproduced by those around her. The fact that only strings of the first\nkind occur is in this case negative evidence \u2014 defeasible, to \nbe sure, but negative evidence nonetheless.\n\n\nIn fact, the use of positive evidence to disconfirm hypotheses is \nendemic to science. For instance, Millikan used positive evidence to \ndisconfirm the theory that electrical charge is a quantity that \nvaries continuously. In his famous \u2018Oil Drop\u2019 experiment,\nhe found that the amount of charge possessed by a charged oil drop \nwas always a whole-number multiple of \u2014(1.6 x 10-19)C. The \nfinding that all observed charges were \u2018quantized\u2019 in \nthis manner disconfirmed the competing \u2018continuous \ncharges\u2019 hypothesis in the same way that positive evidence can \ndisconfirm grammatical \n hypotheses.[16]\n\n\nFeedback The Argument from the \u2018Unlearning\nProblem\u2019 also points to the lack of feedback provided to\nchildren learning language. In a famous study often cited by\nproponents of the argument, Brown and Hanlon 1970 (see also Brown,\n1973 and Brown, Cazden, and Bellugi 1969) found no overt disapproval\nby mothers of the syntactic errors of their children, and moreover\nfound that caregivers had no trouble understanding their charges'\nill-formed utterances.  Only semantic errors were occasionally\ncorrected; grammatical mistakes went unremarked.\n\n\n\nHowever, more recent findings have uncovered evidence indicating that\nfailures of understanding occur with some regularity, and that there \nis a wealth of feedback about correct usage in the language-learning \nenvironment. For example:\n\n Hirsh-Pasek, Trieman and Schneiderman (1984) studied interactions\nbetween 2 year olds and their parents, and discovered that caregivers\nrepeated and corrected 20.8% of flawed sentences, whereas they only\nrepeated (without correction) 12.0% of well-formed utterances.\n Demetras, Post and Snow (1986) found that in general, only\nwell-formed sentences were repeated verbatim by parents, and that\nill-formed sentences were not repeated verbatim, but were rather\nfollowed by clarification questions (\u201cWhat?\u201d \u2014\nindicating a lack of understanding) or expansions and/or recasts,\ncorrecting the error.\n Bohannon and Stanowicz (1988) found that 34% of syntactic and 35%\nof phonological errors received some form of differential feedback\n(e.g., repetitions with corrections or explicit rejection of the\nutterance); that more than 90% of parents' exact repetitions\nfollow well-formed sentences; and that more than 70% of recasts and\nexpansions follow ill-formed utterances.\n Chouinard and Clark's (2003) longitudinal study of five\nchildren learning language found that parents reformulate erroneous\nutterances more often than correct utterances, that they respond\nequally often to all error types (phonological, lexical, syntactic,\nsemantic), and that they correct younger children, who make more\nerrors, more frequently.\n Perhaps most tellingly, Moerk (1991) performed a reanalysis of\nBrown's \u201cEve\u201d transcripts (among those on which the\n1970 \u2018no feedback claim was based) and found many instances in\nwhich Eve's semantic and syntactic errors were explicitly\ncorrected, including: her use of noun labels; VPs (tense, modality,\nauxiliaries); determiners and prepositions; word order (these last\nsorts of error were rare, but were invariably corrected).\n Bohannon, MacWhinney and Snow (1990) review other results in this\nvein, as well as responding to nativist criticisms of these findings\nand their bearing on the unlearning problem.\n\n2.3.1 (b) Children Can and Do Learn from \u2018Noisy\u2019 Data and Exploit Statistical Regularities\n\n\nChomsky has recognized the existence of such \u2018indirect\u2019 \nnegative data in the pld. However, he concluded that they \nwere too few and ambiguous to be of aid to the language learner. The \nsorts of findings reported above seem to show that negative evidence \nis pervasive in the pld. But can children learn from these \nsorts of statistical regularities?\n\n\nStandard \n formulations[17]\n of the \u2018Unlearning Problem\u2019, assume that they cannot: the\nview seems to be that learning can only take place under idealized \nconditions where the world supplies unambiguous evidence pro or con \nthe language learner's grammatical theories. Given such a conception \nof the learner, none of the examples of feedback just discussed will \nseem relevant to the problem. For only a learner employing fairly \nsophisticated data-analysis techniques and a confirmation measure \nthat is sensitive to small changes in probabilities would be able to \nexploit the sorts of regularities in the linguistic environment that \nwe have just discussed. However, there is increasing evidence that \nchildren are in fact remarkably sensitive to subtle feedback, in both\nlinguistic and non-linguistic domains. For instance:\n\n Bohannon and Stanowicz (1988) found that children pay particular\nattention to parental corrections of their mistakes: they imitate\n25.6% of adult expansions (saying the same thing as the child, but\ngiving more detail) and recasts (repetitions of the child's\nutterance, correcting errors), whereas they only imitate 3.6% of exact\nor verbatim repetitions by parents of the child's utterance.\n Relatedly, Farrer (1990 1992) found that children were more\nlikely to repeat a given morpheme if it were part of an adult recast\nof one of the child's own sentences, than if it were part of a a\nnon-repetitious adult utterance (e.g., a change of subject or a\ncontinuation of the conversation). She also found that\nchildren's repetition of adult utterances facilitated the\nchild's acquisition of various grammatical morphemes.\n Morgan and Travis (1989) and Morgan et al. (1995)\ndispute the long-term efficacy of such corrective feedback; Bohannonn\net al. 1996 respond.\n However, in both longitudinal studies of children in natural\nenvironments (Chouinard and Clark 2003) and in experimental studies\n(Saxton et al. 1998, and Saxton 1997, Saxton, Backley and Galloway,\n2003) the long-term efficacy of feedback has been demonstrated.\n\n\n\nIn addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that babies, children,\nadults and many other mammals are highly sensitive not just to \nfeedback, but to other non-obvious statistical regularities in their \nexperience. For example:\n\n Saffran, Aslin and Newport (1996) found that 8 month old babies\nwere able to learn where the word boundaries in an artificial language\noccurred after a mere 2 minutes' exposure to a stream of\nartificial speech.  The stream consisted of 3-syllable nonsense words\n(bidaku, padoti, golabu) repeated\ncontinuously for 2 minutes (bidakupadotigolabubidakugolabi\n\u2026etc.).  The stream was constructed so that the\n\u2018transitional probability\u2019 of two sounds X#Y was equal to\n1 when the sounds formed part of a word, and equal to 1/3 when the\nsounds spanned a word boundary. In two minutes, the infants had\nlearned to discriminate the \u2018words\u2019 (like bidaku)\nfrom the \u2018non-words\u2019 (e.g., kupado). See also\nChambers, Onishi and Fisher 2003.\n Other studies have expanded upon these results, indicating that\nchildren and babies are sensitive to patterns in a wide range of\nverbal cues, such as linguistic rhythm (Nazzi and Ramus 2003);\nprosodic stress (Thiessen and Saffran 2003) and voicing and syllabic\nstructure (Saffran and Thiessen 2003).\n Moreover, there is increasingly persuasive evidence that\nstatistical or \u2018distributional\u2019 information may be used\nnot just for the extraction of word boundaries, but \u2014 contrary\nto an old argument of Chomsky's \u2014 to limn higher levels of\nsyntactic structure as well \u2014 see, e.g., Redington and Chater,\n1998; Pena et al. 2002; Mintz 2002; Saffran 2002; Saffran and\nWilson 2003; Newport and Aslin 2004. Chater and Manning 2006 provide\na survey.)\n Finally, and forestalling any response along the lines that what\nwe are seeing here is just the nativist's \u2018Language Acquisition\nDevice\u2019 in action, a number of studies have shown that similar\nmechanisms appear to be at work in learning in non-linguistic domains\n(Saffran 2002, studied learning of non-linguistic sounds and shapes);\nin adults (Pena et al. 2002); and in other animals, such as\ncotton-top tamarin monkeys (Hauser 2001; Hauser, Weiss and Marcus,\n2002).\n\n\n\nTaken together, these kinds of results raise the possibility that \nsome of the foundational learning mechanisms involved in language \nacquisition are not language specific. If it turns out that babies \nemploy the sorts of distributional analysis studied by Saffran, \nRedington and Chater, Pena, and Mintz not only in learning artificial\nlanguages, but also in learning natural languages, then that is \nevidence against linguistic nativism. For this type of learning is \nemployed by humans and other animals in other contexts as well: \nwhatever is involved in language learning \u2014 be it innate or not\n\u2014 is not language-specific.\n2.3.1 (c) The Generality of the Argument\n\n\nThe previous objections to the Unlearning Problem Argument made the \npoints, first, that negative evidence does exist in the pld \n(in the form of regularities both in others' language use and in how \nothers react to children's own productions), and second, that \nchildren (and other animals) seem very good at exploiting this kind \nof information for the purposes of learning about their world. This \nwould seem to be rather a good thing, given that there is reason to \nthink that learners must be able to learn in domains where \nexplicit negative data do not exist, and in the absence of \nspecialized innate knowledge of those domains. For the unlearning \nproblem is a problem for learning from experience quite generally. \nThat is, there are many domains in which learners lack explicit \nevidence as to what things are not: trees are not cars, \nIrish stews are not curries, birds are not fish and MacDonald's is \nnot a branch of the CIA. No-one ever told you any of these things, \nbut it's crazy to think that you now know them because you possess \nanalogs to the \u2018Language Acquisition Device\u2019 for each of \nthese domains. Clearly, in at least some areas, people are able to \nlearn an awful lot on the basis of largely positive data, and while \nthis of course does nothing to show that language is one of those \nareas, it does indicate that the Unlearning problem argument by \nitself is no argument for linguistic nativism at all, let alone for \nthe Chomskyan (UG-based) version of that position.\n3. Other Research Bearing on the Innateness of Language: New Problems for the Nativist?\n\n\nIn this section, I will mention some other avenues of research that \nhave been argued to have a bearing on the innateness of language. My \ngoal is not to give an exhaustive survey of these matters, but rather\nto provide the interested reader with a way into the relevant \nliteratures. Still, I will try to give enough details so as to make a\ncase that current empirical findings, together with the flaws \nidentified in \u00a7\u00a71 and 2 in the positive arguments for \nlinguistic nativism, tend to militate against that position.\n3.1 Linguistic Universals\n\n\nChomsky and others (e.g., Chomsky 1988:46-7; Pinker 1994:237-8) \nhave pointed to the existence of \u2018linguistic universals\u2019 \nas supporting the idea that language is the product of a distinct \nfaculty of mind. Universals are features thought to be common to all \nnatural languages, such as the existence of constraints on the \nmovement of elements during a derivation or, less controversially, \nthe existence of a syntactic distinction between nouns and verbs. But\nnot only is the existence of true universals a contested matter (see \ne.g., Maratsos 1989:111), it is unclear what the correct explanation\nof them \u2014 assuming they exist \u2014 is would be.\n\n\nOne explanation is certainly the Chomskyan one that they are \nconsequences of speakers' innate knowledge of UG. Another is that \nthey derive from other, non-linguistically-specific features of \ncognition, such as memory or processing constraints (e.g., Berwick \nand Weinberg 1983 trace certain constraints on movement to \nlimitations on parsing imposed by the structure of human memory). Yet\nanother is that they derive from universal demands of the \ncommunication situation (e.g., Sapir 1921, argued that the \ndistinction between nouns and verbs arises from the fact that \nlanguage is used to communicate propositions, hence needs a way to \nbring an object subject to mind and a way to say something about it).\nFinally, as Putnam 1971 speculated, universals might be relics of an\nancestral Ur-language from which all other languages evolved. This \nlast hypothesis has generally been rejected as lacking in empirical \nsupport. However, recent findings in genetics and historical \nlinguistics are converging to suggest that all human populations \nevolved from a small group migrating from Africa in the fairly recent\npast, and that all human languages have probably evolved from the \nlanguage spoken by that group. (Cavalli-Sforza 1997.)\n\n\nThe Ur-language hypothesis is not, of course, inconsistent with \nlinguistic nativism. However, if true, it does weaken any \nargument from the existence of universals to the innateness \nof linguistic knowledge. For if languages have a common ancestor, \nthen it is possible to explain universals \u2014 even ones that seem\nstrange from a functional point of view \u2014 as being the result \nof our ancestors' having adopted a certain solution to a linguistic \ncoordination problem. Like driving on the right side of the road, a \nsolution once established may become entrenched, because the benefits\nof everyone's conforming to the same rule outweigh the costs of \nchanging to a different rule, and this may be so even if the new rule\nwere in some sense more \u2018reasonable.\u2019 Thus, even \narbitrary or odd features of language can be explained historically, \nwithout positing either compelling functional considerations or \ninborn linguistic \n constraints.[18]\n\n\n\nIf, by contrast, language emerged independently in a number of areas,\nthe existence of universals would be a strong argument for nativism, \nFor in that case, it would be implausible to maintain that each \nancestral group \u2018just happened\u2019 to select the same \nsolutions to the various coordination problems they encountered. More\nplausible would be the supposition that the different groups' choice \nof the rule was driven by something internal to speakers, \nsuch as, perhaps, an innate representation of UG. In short: if \nlanguages have a common ancestor, then common descent from originally\narbitrary linguistic conventions is a possible explanation of \nlinguistic universals, including the \u2018odd\u2019 or \n\u2018arbitrary\u2019 ones that don't seem to have any real \nfunctional significance. If they don't, then such universals \nseemingly could only be explained in terms of features internal to \nspeakers.\n3.2 Language Localization\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Broca's area and Wernicke's area\n\n\n\nBeginning with the work of Broca and Wernicke in the 19th century, a \npopular view has been that language is localized to certain areas of \nthe brain (see Fig. 3), almost always the left \n hemisphere,[19]\n and that it is subject to characteristic patterns of breakdown, \ncalled \u2018aphasias.\u2019 (See Saffran 2000 for a survey of the\nvarious aphasias.) For example, Broca's area is strongly implicated \nin speech production, and damage to this area can result in a \ncharacteristic inability (\u2018Broca's aphasia\u2019 or \n\u2018agrammatism\u2019) to produce fluent speech, especially \ncomplex grammatical structures and grammatical morphemes. The fact \nthat syntax can apparently be selectively interfered with by lesions \nto Broca's area has been taken by some to indicate that grammatical \nknowledge is localized to that area, and this in turn has been taken \nto show support the view that there is a special biological inborn \nbasis for that knowledge. (Lenneberg 1964, 1967 is the original \nproponent of this argument, which is echoed in more recent \ndiscussions, such as Pinker 1994:297-314.)\n\n\nIt is unclear, however, why this inference should seem compelling.\nFirst, as Elman et al. 1996 argue, neural localization of\nfunction can occur as a result of virtually any developmental\ntrajectory: the localization of some function bears not at all on its\ninnateness.\n\n\nSecondly, it is now known that neural localization for language is \nvery much a relative, rather than an all-or-nothing matter (Dronkers \net al. 2000, Dick et al. 2001, Martin 2003). Not\nonly is language processing widely distributed over the brain (see\nFig. 4), but traditionally language-specific areas of cortex are\nimplicated in a variety of non-linguistic tasks as well. Broca's area,\nfor instance, \u2018lights up\u2019 on MEG scans\n(magnetoencephalography, a method for measuring changes in the\nmagnetic properties of the brain due to electrical activity) when\nsubjects hear a discordant musical sequence in much the same way as it\ndoes when they hear an ungrammatical utterance. (Maess et\nal. 2001; a special issue of Nature Neuroscience, 6(7),\nJuly 2003, explores the implications of this finding.)\n\n\nFinally, recent studies of cortical plasticity have shown that even\nthe most plausible candidates for innate specification \u2014 such as\nthe use of visual cortex for vision or the use of auditory cortex for\nhearing \u2014 exhibit high degrees of experience-dependent\nplasticity. For example, in congenitally blind subjects, the areas of\nthe brain normally used for seeing are taken over for the processing\nof Braille (Sadato et al. 1996; Hamilton and Pascual-Leone,\n1998) and even in those with late-onset blindness, significant\n\u2018rewiring\u2019 of visual cortex for other perceptual tasks is\napparent (Kujala et al. 1997). Likewise, in the congenitally deaf,\nauditory cortex is used for the processing of sign language (Nishimura\net al. 1999, von Melchner, Pallas and Sur 2000). (See Shimojo and\nShams 2001, for a review.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Pet scan showing brain regions involved in various language\ntasks. From Posner and Raichle (1997, 15). Used by permission of M. \nRaichle.\n\n\n\nAs Marcus (2004:40-45) points out in response to Elman et\nal. 1996, the ability of the brain to \u2018rewire\u2019 itself\nunder exceptional circumstances is consistent with its having been\n\u2018prewired,\u2019 or set up, differently by the genes. However,\nthese sorts of data indicate that complex functions, such as are\ninvolved in processing sign language, can be carried out in areas of\nbrain that are \u2018prewired\u2019 (if they are) to do something\nquite different.  This suggests that these abilities require little in\nthe way of task-specific pre-wiring, and are learned largely on the\nbasis of experience (together with whatever sort of 'prewiring' is\nsupplied for the cortex as a whole). That is, if sign language\nprocessing tasks can be carried out by areas of cortex that are\npresumably innately predisposed (if they are) to do auditory\nprocessing, then the former competence must be being learned in the\nabsence of inborn constraints or knowledge that are specific to that\ntask. Of course, these are pathological cases, and it is unclear\nwhether the subjects in these experiments had any special training in\norder that their brains were \u2018rewired\u2019 in these\nways. Nonetheless, examples like these provide an existence proof of\nthe brain's ability to acquire complex processing capacities \u2014\nindeed, processing capacities relevant to language \u2014 in the\ncomplete absence of inborn, domain-specific information. As such, they\nraise the possibility that other aspects of language processing are\nsimilarly acquired in the absence of task-specific constraints.\n\n\nIn sum, the neuroscientific evidence currently available provides no \nsupport for linguistic nativism. The suggestion that localization of \nfunction is indicative of a substantial degree of innate \nprespecification is no longer tenable: localization can arise in many\ndifferent ways. In addition, linguistic functions do not seem to be \nparticularly localized: language use and understanding are complex \ntasks, involving many different brain areas \u2014 areas that are in\nat least some cases implicated also in other tasks. It is hard to see\nhow to reconcile these facts with the Chomskyan postulation of a \nmonolithic \u2018language organ,\u2019 the development or \n\u2018growth\u2019 of which is controlled largely by the genes. \nFinally, the fact that complex functions can be learned and carried \nout by areas of brain that are innately \u2018prewired\u2019 (if at\nall) to do quite different sorts of processing indicates that such \ncompetences can be and are acquired without any inborn, task-specific\nguidance. This is not, of course, to say that language is one of the \ncompetences that are acquired in this way. For all the current \nevidence shows, many areas of cortex in which language develops may \nindeed be \u2018prewired\u2019 for that task: linguistic nativism \nis still consistent with what is now known. It is, however, to \nsuggest that although there may be other reasons to be a linguistic \nnativist, general considerations to do with brain organization or \ndevelopment as currently understood give no especial support to that \nposition.\n3.3 The Critical Period for Language Acquisition\n\n\nLenneberg (1964, 1967) also argued that although language acquisition\nis remarkably robust, in the sense that all normal (and many \nabnormal) children do it, it can occur unproblematically only during \na \u2018critical period\u2019 \u2014 roughly, up to late childhood\nor early puberty. On analogy with other supposedly innately specified\nprocesses like imprinting or visual development, Lenneberg used the \nexistence of a critical period as further evidence that language \npossesses a proprietary basis in biology.\n\n\nIn support of the critical period hypothesis about language, \nLenneberg cited the facts (i) that retarded (e.g., Downs syndrome) \nchildren's language development stops around puberty; (ii) that \nwhereas very young children are able to (re)learn language after \naphasias produced by massive left-hemisphere trauma (including \nhemispherectomy), aphasias in older children and adults are typically\nnot reversible; and (iii) that so-called \u2018wild children,\u2019\nviz., those who grow up with no or little exposure to human language,\nexhibit severely compromised language skills. (Lenneberg, \n1957:142-55; see Curtiss 1977 for the (in)famous case of Genie, a \nmodern-day \u2018wild child\u2019 from suburban Los Angeles, who \nwas unable to acquire any but the most rudimentary grammatical \ncompetence after a miserable and wordless childhood spent locked \nalone in a room, tied to her potty chair or bed.)\n\n\nAs further support for the critical period hypothesis, others have \nadded the observation that although children are able to learn a \nsecond language rapidly and to native speaker fluency, adult learners\nof second languages typically are not: the capacity to learn a second\nlanguage tapers off after puberty, no matter how much exposure to the\nlanguage one has. (Newport 1990). Thus, it was speculated, the \ninnate knowledge base for language learning (e.g., knowledge of UG) \nbecomes unavailable for normal acquisition at puberty, and adult \nlearners must rely on less efficient learning methods. (Johnson and \nNewport 1989.)\n\n\nAs a preliminary to discussing these arguments (many of which are \npresented in more detailed in Stromswold 2000) it is worth \ndistinguishing two notions that often get conflated under the name \n\u2018critical period\u2019:\n\n\nCritical Period: a time during development which is \nliterally critical; the relevant competence either cannot \ndevelop or will be permanently lost unless certain inputs are \nreceived during that period.\n\nSensitive Period: a time during development in which a \ncompetence is acquired \u2018normally,\u2019 or \n\u2018easily,\u2019 or \u2018naturally.\u2019 The competence can \nbe acquired outside the sensitive period, but perhaps less easily and\nnaturally, and or perhaps with less ultimate success.\n\n\n\nThe classic example of a critical period is due to the Nobel \nprize-winning work of Hubel and Wiesel. By suturing shut one of a \nkitten's eyes at various stages of development and for various \nperiods of time, Hubel and Wiesel (1970) showed that certain cortical\nand thalamic areas supporting binocular vision (specifically, ocular \ndominance \n columns[20]\n and cells in the lateral geniculate body) will not develop normally \nunless kittens receive patterned visual stimulation during the 4th to\n12th weeks of life. They found that while the damage was sometimes \nreversible to some extent, depending on the exact duration and timing\nof the occlusion, occlusion for the entire first three months of life\nproduced irreversible blindness in the deprived \n eye.[21]\n\n\n\nLanguage, however, is not like this. As we will see, there is little \nevidence for a critical period for language acquisition, \nalthough there is considerable evidence that there is a sensitive\nperiod during which language is acquired more easily. The \nimplications of this for claims about the innateness of language will\nbe addressed in \u00a73.3.4.\n3.3.1 Language recovery after trauma\n\n\nLenneberg cited the superior ability of children to (re)learn \nlanguage after left brain injury in support of the critical period \nhypothesis. But while there clearly is a difference between the \nabilities of young children, on the one hand, and older children and \nadults, on the other, to recover from left brain insults, the contrast \nin recovery course and outcome is not as stark as is often supposed.\n\n\nFirst, older children \u2014 even those who have not succeeded in \nlearning language previously \u2014 can substantially recover from \nleft hemisphere trauma occurring well after the supposed closure of \nthe \u2018sensitive\u2019 or \u2018critical\u2019 period; in \neffect, they learn language from scratch as adolescents. \nVargha-Khadem et al. 1997, for instance, report the case of Alex, \nwho failed to speak at all during childhood and whose receptive \nlanguage was at age 3-4 level at age 9. After his left cortex was \nremoved at age 9, Alex suddenly began to learn language with gusto, \nand by age 15, his skills were those of an 8-10 year old.\n\n\nSecondly, most adults suffering infarcts in the left hemisphere \nlanguage areas do in fact recover at least some degree of language \ncompetence and many recover substantially normal competence, \nespecially with treatment (Holland et al. 1996). This is thought to \nbe due both to the regeneration of damaged speech areas and to \ncompensatory development in other areas, particularly in the right \nhemisphere (Karbe et al. 1998). Similar processes seem to be at work\nin young children with left hemisphere damage. Muller et al. 1999, \nfor instance, document significant relearning of language, together \nwith increased right-hemisphere involvement in language tasks, after \nleft-hemisphere lesions in both children (<10) years) and adults \n(>20 years).\n\n\nFinally, not even very young children are guaranteed to recover \nlanguage after serious insults, whether to the left or right \nhemisphere. As Bates and Roe (2001) argue in their survey of the \nchildhood aphasia literature, outcomes differ wildly from case to \ncase, and the reported studies exhibit numerous methodological \nconfounds (e.g., inability to localize the lesion or to know its \ncause, different measures of linguistic competence, different time \nframes for testing, statistical irregularities, and failure to \ncontrol for other factors known to affect language such as seizure \nhistory) that cast doubt on the degree of empirical support possessed\nby Lenneberg's claim in this instance.\n3.3.2 \u2018Wild children\u2019\n\n\nIt has long been recognized that interpretation of the \u2018wild\nchild\u2019 literature \u2014 helpfully surveyed in Skuse 1993\n\u2014 is confounded by the fortunate rarity of these \u2018natural\nexperiments,\u2019 the generally poor reporting of them, and the\nother environmental factors (abuse, malnutrition, neglect, etc.) that\noften go along with extreme linguistic deprivation.  However, in work\npioneered by Goldin Meadow and colleagues (e.g., Goldin Meadow and\nMylander 1983, 1990), a new population of individuals, who are\nlinguistically but not otherwise deprived, has begun to be\nstudied. Deaf but otherwise normal children of hearing parents who are\nneither educated in sign language nor sent to special schools for the\ndeaf do not acquire language, although they usually develop their own\nrudimentary signing systems, called \u2018homesign,\u2019 to use\nwith their families. Studies of what happens to such children after\nthey are exposed to natural languages (signed or verbal) at various\nages promise to offer new insights into the critical and sensitive\nperiod hypotheses.\n\n\nAt this time, however, there are still very few case reports in the \nliterature, and the data so far obtained in these studies are \nequivocal with respect to the sensitive and critical period \nhypotheses. Some adolescents do seem to be able to acquire language \ndespite early linguistic deprivation, and others do not. It is \nunclear what the explanation of these different outcomes is, but one \nimportant factor appears to be whether the new language is a signed \nlanguage (e.g., ASL) or a spoken language. Perhaps because their \nchildhood perceptual deficits prevented normal auditory and \narticulatory development, deaf children whose hearing is restored \nlater in life do not seem to be able to acquire much in the way of \nspoken language. (Grimshaw et al. 1998.)\n3.3.3 Second language acquisition in children and adults\n\n\nThe issue of second language acquisition (\u201cSLA\u201d) has been\nargued to bear on the innateness of language by supporting a critical\n(or sensitive) period hypothesis. For instance, Johnson and Newport \n(1989) found that among immigrants arriving in the U.S. before \npuberty, English performance as adults was better the earlier in life\nthey arrived, but that there were no effects of arrival age on \nlanguage performance for those arriving after puberty. The fact that \nthe amount of exposure to the second language mattered for speakers \nif it occurred before puberty but not after, was \ntaken to confirm the critical period hypothesis.\n\n\nHowever, these results have failed to be replicated (Birdsong and\nMolis 2001) and while it still has its supporters, the \u2018critical\nperiod\u2019 hypothesis regarding second language acquisition is\nincreasingly being criticized (Hakuta, Bialystok and Wiley 2003;\nNikolov and Djugunovich 2006). Newer studies have argued, for\ninstance, that the degree of proficiency in a second language\ncorrelates better with, such factors as the learner's level of\neducational attainment in that language, her length of residence in\nthe new country,) and the grammatical similarities between the first\nand second languages, and/or length of residence in the new\ncountry. (Flege, Yeni-Komshian and Liu 1999; Bialystok,\n1997)[22]\n\n\nThe fact that many adults and older children can learn both first and\nsecond languages to a high degree of proficiency makes clear that \nunlike the kitten visual system studied by Hubel and Wiesel, the \nlanguage acquisition system in humans is not subject to a critical \nperiod in the strict sense. This finding is consistent with the \nemerging view that the cortex remains highly plastic throughout life,\nand that contrary to received wisdom, even old dogs can be quite good\nat learning new tricks. (See Buonomano and Merzenich 1998; Cowen and\nGavazzi 1998; Quartz and Sejnowski 1997; and Stiles 2000.) It is \nalso consistent with the idea, which seems more plausible \nthan the critical period hypothesis, that there is a \nsensitive period for language acquisition \u2014 a time, \nfrom roughly birth age 1 to age 6 or 7, in which language is acquired\nmost easily and naturally, and when a native-like outcome is \nvirtually guaranteed. (Cf. Mayberry and Eichen 1991.) The \nimplications of this conclusion for linguistic nativism are examined \nin the next section.\n3.3.4 Sensitive periods and innateness: phonological learning\n\n\nWhat does the existence of a sensitive period for language mastery\ntell us about the innateness of language? In this section, we will\nlook at a case, namely phonological learning, in which the existence\nof a sensitive period has received much press, and in which the\ninference from sensitivity to the existence of language-specific\ninnate information has been made explicitly (see Eimas 1975). One can\nargue that even in this case, the inference to linguistic nativism is\nweak.\n\n\nMuch rarer than mastery of second language morphology and syntax is \nattainment of a native-like accent, something that first language \nlearners acquire automatically in \n childhood.[23]\n A child's ability to perceive language-specific sounds begins in \nutero, as demonstrated, for instance, by newborns' preference for the\nsounds of their mother's voice and their parents' language, and by \ntheir ability to discriminate prose passages that they have heard \nduring the final trimester from novel passages. In the first few \nmonths of life, babies reliably discriminate many different natural \nlanguage phonemes, whether or not they occur in what is soon to \nbecome their language. By ages 6 months to 1 year, however, this \nsensitivity to unheard phonemes largely disappears, and by age 1, \nchildren tend to make only the phonological distinctions made in the \nlanguage(s) they hear around them. For example, Japanese children \nlose the ability to discriminate English /r/ and /l/ (Kuhl et al., \n1997b). As adults, people continue to be unable to perceive some \nphonetic contrasts not marked by their language, and many fail to \nlearn how to produce even those second language sounds which they can\n\n distinguish.[24]\n For instance, many English speakers of French have great difficulty \nin producing the French /y/ (as in tu) and \nback-of-the-throat /r/.\n\n\nThus, in the case of phonological learning, there does seem to be an \ninborn predisposition to segment vocal sounds into language-relevant \nunits, or \n phonemes.[25]\n However, there is also evidence that learning plays a role in shaping\nphonological knowledge \u2014 and not just by \u2018pruning \naway\u2019 unwanted \u2018phonological representations,\u2019 as \nEimas (1975) hypothesized, but also by shaping the precise boundaries\nof adult phonemic categories. For example, caregivers reliably speak \na special \u2018language\u2019 (\u201cMotherese\u201d or \n\u201cParentese\u201d) to young babies, raising pitch, shortening \nsentences, emphasizing stressed morphemes and word boundaries and \n\u2014 most relevant here \u2014 exaggerating the acoustical \ndifferences between certain crucial vowels (in English, /i/, /a/ and \n/u/) . This \u2018stretching\u2019 of the distance between vowels \n(demonstrated in Finnish and Russian as well as English by Kuhl et \nal. 1997a) facilitates the infant's representation of clearly \ndistinguishable vowel prototypes. Kuhl 2000 argues that these \nprototypes subsequently function as \u2018magnets\u2019 around \nwhich subsequent linguistic experiences are organized, and form the \nset points of the language-specific phonological \u2018map\u2019 \nthat emerges by the end of the first year.\n\n\nIf this is indeed how phonological learning works, it is clear that \nwhile experience clearly plays a role, the inborn contribution to \nthat process is quite substantial. For discriminating phonemes \n\u2014 however those discriminations might be shaped by subsequent \nexperience \u2014 is no simple matter. It involves what is called \n\u2018categorical perception, that is, the segmenting of a signal \nthat varies continuously along a number of physical dimensions (e.g.,\nvoice onset time and formant frequency) into discrete categories, so \nthat signals within the category are counted as the same, even though\nacoustically, they may differ from one another more than do two \nsignals in different categories (see Fig. 5). (Harnad 1987 is a \nuseful collection of work on categorical perception to the \nmid-1980s.)\n\n\nBut is this inborn contribution to phonological learning language\nspecific, that is, does it support the conclusion that (this \naspect of) language is innate? And to this question, the answer \nappears to be \u2018No.\u2019 First, the \u2018chunking\u2019 of \ncontinuously varying stimuli into discrete categories is a feature \nnot just of speech perception, but of human perception generally. For\ninstance, it has been demonstrated in the perception of \nnon-linguistic sounds, like musical pitch, key and melody, and \nmeaningless chirps and bleats (Pastore and Layer 1990). It has also \nbeen demonstrated in the processing of visual stimuli like faces \n(Beale and Keil 1995), facial expressions (Etcoff and Magee 1992; \nKotsoni, de Haan and Johnson 2001); facial gender (Campanella, \nChrysochoos and Bruyer 2001); and familiar physical objects (Newell \nand Bulthoff 2002). Secondly, it is known that other animals too \nperceive categorically. For instance, crickets segment consepecific \nsongs in terms of frequency (Wyttenbach, May and Hoy 1996), swamp \nsparrows \u2018chunk\u2019 notes of differing durations (Nelson and\nMarler 1989), and rhesus monkeys can recognize melodies when \ntransposed by one or two octaves, but not by 1.5 or 2.5 octaves, \nindicating a grasp of musical key (Wright et al. 2000). Finally, \nother species respond categorically to human speech! Chinchillas \n(Kuhl and Miller 1975) and cotton-top tamarins (Ramus et al. 2000) \nmake similar phonological distinctions to those made by human \ninfants.\n\n\nTogether, as Kuhl 1994, 2000 argues, these findings cast doubt on \nthe language-specificity of the inborn perceptual and categorization \ncapacities that form the basis of human phonological learning. For \ngiven the fact that human (and animal) perception quite generally is \ncategorical, it is arguable that languages have evolved so as to \nexploit the perceptual distinctions that humans are able to make, \nrather than humans' having evolved the abilities to make just the \ndistinctions that are made in human languages, as a view like Eimas' \nwould suggest. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Note that the pair of sounds circled in blue differ in F2 \nstarting frequency less than those circled in red, yet the former are\nboth reliably counted as instances of the sounds /b/ whereas the \nlatter are reliably classified as different sounds, /d/ and /g/. This\npattern, together with the abrupt switch from one classification to \nanother (e.g. /b/ to /g/), is characteristic of categorical \nperception.\n\n\n\nThe same may be true in non-phonological domains too. The notion that\nat least some of the capacities responsible for syntactic learning \nare non-language specific is suggested by analogous results about the\nnon-species specificity of recursive rule learning and generalization\n\u2014 an ability that Chomsky has recently suggested forms the core\nof the human language faculty. (Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002; see \nbelow, 3.4 for further discussion.) Other species, notably cotton top\ntamarins, seem capable of learning simple recursive rules (Hauser, \nWeiss, and Marcus 2002). In addition, Hauser and McDermott 2003 \nargue that musical and syntactic processing involve similar \ncompetences, which are again seen in other species. Together, these \nfindings suggest that there are aspects of the human \u2018language \nfaculty\u2019 that are neither task-specific nor species-specific. \nInstead, language learning and linguistic processing make use of \nabilities that predate language phylogenetically, and that are used \nin humans and in animals for other sorts of tasks. (See e.g., Hauser,\nWeiss, and Marcus 2002 for an account of recent work on rule \nlearning by cotton top tamarins; see Hauser and McDermott 2003 for \nthe suggestion that aspects of musical and syntactic processing \ninvolve similar competences, which are again seen in other species.) \nRather than viewing the human mind as being innately specialized for \nlanguage language learning, it seems at least as reasonable to think \nof languages as being specialized so as to be learnable and usable by\nthe human mind; of this, more in \u00a73.4 below.\n3.4 Language Evolution\n\n\nThis brings us to the question of language evolution: if knowledge of\nlanguage (say, of the principles of UG) really is inborn in the human\nlanguage faculty, how did such inborn knowledge evolve? For many \nyears, Chomsky himself refused to speculate about this matter, \nstating that \u201c[e]volutionary theory\u2026has little to say, \nas of now, about questions of this nature\u201d (1988:167). Other \ntheorists have not been so reticent, and a large literature has grown\nup in which the selective advantages of having a language are \nadumbrated. It's good for communicating with, for instance, when \ntrying to figure out what conspecifics are up to (Pinker and Bloom, \n1990; Dunbar 1996). It's a mechanism of group cohesion, analogous to\nprimate grooming (Dunbar 1996). It's a non-genetic mechanism of \nphenotypical plasticity, allowing organisms to adapt to their \nenvironment in non-evolutionary time (Brandon and Hornstein 1986; \nSterelny 2003). It's a mechanism by which we can bend others to our \nwill (Dawkins and Krebs 1979; Catania 1990), or make social \ncontracts (Skyrms 1996). Language makes us smarter, perhaps by being\ninternalized and functioning as a \u2018language of thought\u2019 \n(Bickerton 1995, 2000). And so on.\n\n\nThe ability to speak and understand a language no doubt provided and \ncontinues to provide us with many of these benefits. Consequently \n(and assuming that the costs were not too great \u2014 as patently \nthey weren't), one can be sure that whatever it is about human beings\nthat enables them to learn and use language would have been subjected\nto strong positive selection pressure once it began to emerge in our \nspecies.\n\n\nBut none of this speaks directly to the issue of linguistic nativism.\nThe fact that Mother Nature would have favored individuals or groups \npossessing linguistic abilities tells us nothing about the \nmeans she chose to get the linguistic phenotype built. That \nis, it tells us nothing about the sorts of psychological mechanisms \nthat were recruited to enable human beings to learn, and subsequently\nuse, a natural language.\n\n\nNativism is, of course, one possibility. Natural selection might have\nbuilt a specialized language faculty, containing inborn knowledge \nabout language (e.g., knowledge of UG), which subsequently was \nselected for because it helped human children to acquire linguistic \ncompetence, and having linguistic competence enhanced our ancestors' \nfitness. A problem with this hypothesis, however, is that it is \nunclear how a language faculty containing innate representations of \nUG might have arisen in the human mind. One view is that the language\nfaculty was built up piecemeal by natural selection. This approach \nunderlies Pinker and Bloom's (1990) and Jackendoff's (1999) proposals\nas to the adaptive functions of various grammatical features and \ndevices. Other nativists, however, reject the adaptationist \nframework. For instance, Berwick 1998, has argued that efforts to \nexplain the piecemeal development of knowledge of linguistic \nuniversals in our species may be unnecessary in light of the new, \nMinimalist conception of syntax (see Chomsky 1995). On this view, \nall parametric constraints and rules of syntax are consequences of a \nfundamental syntactic process called Merge: once Merge was in place, \nBerwick argues, the rest of UG automatically followed. Chomsky, \ntaking another tack, has suggested that language is a \n\u2018spandrel,\u2019 a byproduct of other non-linguistically \ndirected selective processes, such as \u201cthe increase in brain \nsize and complexity\u201d (1982:23). And finally Bickerton 1998, on \nyet another tack, posits a massive saltative episode in which large \nchunks of syntax emerged all at once, although this posit is \nimplicitly withdrawn in Calvin and Bickerton 2000.\n\n\nThe literature on language evolution is too large to survey in this \narticle (but see Botha 2003 for an excellent overview and critique).\nSuffice it to note that as yet, no consensus has emerged as to how\n innate knowledge of UG might have evolved from \nwhatever preadaptations existed in our ancestors. Of course, this is \nnot in itself a problem for linguistic nativists: formulating and \ntesting hypotheses about human cognitive evolution is a massively \ndifficult enterprise, due largely to the difficulty of finding \nevidence bearing on one's hypothesis. (See Lewontin 1998 and Sterelny\n2003:95-116.)\n\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that linguistic nativism is just one \npossibility for how Nature got language up and running. Just as it \nmay be that a language faculty embodying knowledge of UG was somehow \nencoded in the human genome, it's also possible that that our ability\nto learn a language is based on a congeries of pre-existing \ncompetences, none of which is (or was initially \u2014 see below) \nspecialized for language learning. Tomasello's theory of language \nacquisition, discussed above (\u00a72.2.1.b), invites this \nalternative evolutionary perspective. On his view, the fundamental \nskills with which linguistic competence is acquired are skills that \noriginally served, and still continue to serve, quite different, \nnon-linguistic functions. For example, he argues that children's \nearly word and phrase learning rest in part on their ability to share\nattention with others, to discern others' communicative intentions, \nand to imitate aspects of their behavior. There is reason to think \nthat these abilities evolved independently of language, at least \ninitially: imitation learning enabled the fast and high-fidelity \ntransfer of learned skills between generations (see Tomasello 1999, \n2000) and the ability to form beliefs about the mental states of \nothers (\u2018mind-reading\u2019 or \u2018theory of mind\u2019) \nenabled highly intelligent animals, such as our hominid ancestors, to\nnegotiate a complex social environment made up of similarly \nintelligent conspecifics. (See, e.g., Sterelny 2003.) On this sort \nof view, the ability to learn language piggy-backed on other \ncapacities, which originally evolved for other reasons and which \ncontinue to serve other functions in addition to their linguistic \nones.\n\n\nYou might wonder, however, whether this latter kind of account really\ndiffers substantively from that of a nativist. Assuming that she does\nnot reject adaptationism altogether, the nativist will presumably be \ncommitted to the idea that the innate language organ, or faculty \nembodying knowledge of UG, was derived from pre-existing structures \nthat were either functionless or had non-linguistic functions. These \nstructures subsequently acquired linguistic functions through being \nselected for that reason: they became adaptations for language. But \nso too would the various capacities postulated by Tomasello. As soon \nas they started being used for language learning, that's to say, they\nwould have been selected for that function (in addition to any other \nfunctions they might serve, and always assuming that linguistic \nabilities were on balance beneficial). Hence they too will over time \nbecome adaptations for language. On both Tomasello's and the \nnativist's view, in other words, the inborn structures responsible \nfor language acquisition will have acquired the biological function \nof enabling language acquisition: they will be specialized for that \npurpose. Is Tomasello, then, a nativist?\n\n\nNo. First, even though the psychological abilities and mechanisms \nthat Tomasello posits have been selected for linguistic functions, \nthese abilities and mechanisms have continued to be used (and, \nplausibly, selected) for non-linguistic purposes, such as face \nrecognition, theory of mind, non-linguistic perception, etc. So, \nwhereas a central tenet of linguistic nativism is its insistence that\nthe structures responsible for language learning are \ntask-specific, Tomasello sees those structures as being much\nmore general-purpose. In addition, and this is a second reason not to\ncount Tomasello as a nativist, the inborn structures he posits are \nnot plausibly interpreted as containing any kind of language specific\ninformation or representations. Yet a commitment to the role of \ninborn, language-specific information (such as knowledge of UG) is \nanother hallmark of linguistic nativism.\n\n\nSeveral theorists (e.g., Clark 1996, Tomasello 1999, and Sterelny, \n2003) have stressed that in addition to working on human linguistic \nabilities directly, via changes to the parts of the genome coding for\nthose abilities, natural selection can also bring about such changes \nindirectly, by making sure that our minds are embedded in certain \nkinds of environments. All sorts of animals create environments for \nthemselves: this is called \u2018niche construction.\u2019 (The \nterm is due to Odling-Smee, Laland and Feldman 1996.) Many animals \nalso (or thereby) create environments for their offspring as well. \nAnd as Odling-Smee et al. 1996, Avital and Jablonka 2000, and \nSterelny 2003 stress, animals' dispositions to modify the \nenvironments of both themselves and their offspring in certain ways \nare just as much potential objects of selection as are other of their\ntraits.\n\n\nTo see this, suppose that an organism O has a genetically encoded \ndisposition N to build a special kind of nest; suppose further that \nbeing raised in this kind of nest causes O-type offspring to have \ncharacteristic C; and suppose finally, that Os with C enjoy greater \nreproductive success than those without. Then, assuming that there is\nvariation in N in the population, natural selection can operate so as\nto increase the proportion of Os with N \u2014 and hence also those \nwith characteristic C \u2014 in the population. Down the track, Os \nwill have C not by virtue of acquiring a special, genetically-encoded\ndisposition-for-C. Rather, they will have C because their parents \nhave the genetically-encoded disposition N, and Os whose parents have\nN \u2018automatically\u2019 develop C.\n\n\nThis toy example illustrates a further route by which language might \nhave evolved in human beings. In addition to creating inborn \nlanguage-learning mechanisms in individuals, natural selection may \nalso have created dispositions to construct particular kinds of \nlinguistic learning environments in their parents. \nFor example, as Clark (1996) and Sterelny (2003) both speculate, \nMother Nature might have worked on our dispositions to use \n\u2018Motherese\u2019 to our children, and/or on our tendency to \ntalk about things that are current objects of the child's perceptual \nattention, in order to create learning environments conducive to the \nacquisition of language.\n\n\nIn principle, the existence of this sort of \u2018niche\nconstruction\u2019 can be accepted by all parties to the nativism\ncontroversy. That is, both Tomasello and Chomsky could agree that\ndispositions to construct \u2018linguistic niches\u2019 \u2014\nenvironments in which languages are easy for human offspring to learn\n\u2014 may have been selected for in our species. Nevertheless, the\nnotion of niche construction militates against the nativist,\nparticularly when one takes into account the related notion of\n\u2018cumulative downstream niche construction.\u2019\n\n\nCases of what Sterelny (2003: 149ff) calls \u2018cumulative \ndownstream niche construction\u2019 occur when a generation of \nanimals modifies an environment that has already been modified by \nearlier generations. A mountain thornbill's nest is an instance of \ndownstream niche construction (since its offspring are affected by \nthe thornbill's efforts). However, the construction is not \ncumulative, since the nest is built anew each year. By contrast, a \nrabbit warren extended and elaborated over several generations is an \ninstance of cumulative construction: successive generations of \noffspring inherit an ever-more-complex niche and their other \nbehaviors are tuned accordingly in ever-more-complex ways. Tomasello,\n1999 and Sterelny 2003 stress that niche construction, including \ndownstream niche construction, is not limited to the physical world: \nanimals make changes to their social and epistemic worlds as well. \nFor instance, chimpanzees live in groups (= construction of a social \nniche) and dogs mark their territory (= a change in their epistemic \nniche, relieving them of the necessity of remembering where the \nboundaries of their territory are). Humans, says Sterelny, echoing a \ntheme of Tomasello 1999, are niche constructors \u201cwith a \nvengeance\u201d (2003:149) and many of the changes they make to \ntheir physical, social and epistemic environments accumulate over \nmany generations (think of a city, a democracy, modern science, a \nnatural language). Such cumulative modifications allow for what \nTomasello calls a \u201cratchet effect\u201d: a \u201ccycle in \nwhich an improvement is made, becomes standard for the group, and \nthen becomes a basis for further innovation.\u201d (Sterelny 2003: \n150-1)\n\n\nThe idea of cumulative niche construction has obvious application to \nthe case of language. If parents shape the linguistic environment of \ntheir offspring, and if we all shape the linguistic environments of \nour conspecifics (merely by talking to them!) then the possibility of\na \u2018linguistic ratchet effect\u2019 is clearly open. Small \nchanges made to the language of the group by one generation \u2014 \nchanges which perhaps make it easier to learn, or easier to \nunderstand or produce \u2014 will be transmitted to later \ngenerations, who may in turn make further changes geared to \nincreasing language learnability and ease of use. This scenario \nraises the possibility, already mentioned at the end of the last \nsection, that language may have evolved so as to be learnable and \nusable by us, in addition to the converse scenario (stressed in much \nwork on the evolution of language) that we had to change in \nmany and complex ways in order to learn and use a language. Thus, we \nmight speculate, languages' phonetic systems evolved so as to be \ncongenial to our animal ears; their expressive resources (in \nparticular, their vocabularies) evolved so as to fit our \ncommunicative needs; and perhaps, as Clark 1997 has suggested and as \nTomasello 2003 implicitly takes for granted, natural language syntax\nevolved so as to suit our pre-existing cognitive and processing \ncapacities. To be sure, the languages we have coded in our heads look\ncomplex and weird to linguists and psychologists and philosophers who\nare trying to put together theories about them. But, if languages and\nhuman minds have evolved in tandem, as surely they have, then \nlanguages may not look weird at all from the point of view of the \nbrains that implement and use them.\n\n\nAll of these processes have likely played a role in the evolution of\nour capacities to learn and use a natural language.  Pre-existing\npsychological, perceptual and motor capacities would have been\nrecruited for the task of language learning and use. These capacities\nwould have been honed and specialized further by natural selection for\nthe performance of linguistic tasks. The functions of some of them,\nperhaps, would have become so specialized for language-related tasks\nthat they cease to perform any non-linguistic functions at all \u2014\nand to this extent, perhaps, linguistic nativism would be\nvindicated. At the same time, however, language itself would have been\nevolving so as the better to suit our cognitive and perceptual\ncapacities, and our communicative needs.  Given the fact that many\ndifferent perceptual, motor and cognitive systems are implicated in\nlanguage use and learning, and given the co-evolution of our minds and\nour languages, the truth about language evolution, when it emerges, is\nunlikely to be a simple. For this reason, it is unlikely to\nvindicate the nativist's notion that a specialized and monolithic\n\u2018language organ\u2019 or \u2018faculty\u2019 is at the root\nof our linguistic capacities.\n\n\nBefore leaving the question of language evolution, it is necessary to\nmention a recent paper by Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002 on this \ntopic. First, they distinguish (2002:1571) what they call the \n\u2018faculty of language in the narrow sense,\u2019 or \n\u2018FLN,\u2019 from the \u2018faculty of language in the broad \nsense,\u2019 or \u2018FLB.\u2019 The FLN is the \u201cabstract \nlinguistic computational system alone\u2026which generates internal\nrepresentations and maps them into the sensory-motor interface by the\nphonological system, and into the conceptual-intentional interface by\nthe (formal) semantic system.\u201d (Ibid.) The FLB \nincludes the FLN plus all the other systems (motor systems, \nconceptual systems, perceptual systems, and learning skills) which \ncontribute to language acquisition and use.\n\n\nNext, Hauser et al. speculate that the only thing that's really \nspecial about the human FLB is the FLN. That is, with the exception \nonly of the FLN, FLB comprises systems that are shared with (or only \nslight modifications of) systems in other animals. Consequently, \nthere is no mystery (or no more mystery than usual) about how these \nlanguage-related abilities evolved. FLN, on the other hand, is \ndistinctive to humans and what is special about it is its power of \nrecursion, that is, its ability to categorize linguistic \nobjects into hierarchically organized classes, and (on the behavioral\nside) for the generation of infinitely many sentences out of finitely\nmany words. According to Hauser et al., the only real evolutionary \nmystery about language is how this capacity for recursion evolved \n\u2014 and this question, argue Hauser et al, is eminently \naddressable by normal biological methods (e.g., comparative studies \nto determine possible precursor mechanisms, etc.).\n\n\nHowever, there are two difficulties with this scenario. First, there \nis evidence that the power of recursion posited by Hauser et al. as \nbeing distinctive of the human FLN is in fact not distinctive to \nhumans, because it is not species specific. (See Esser, et al. 1997\nand McGonigle, Chalmers and Dickinson, 2003.) Second, \nrecursiveness is not language specific either, but is a feature of \nother domains of human cognition and endeavor as well. Our conceptual\nspace, for instance, appears to be hierarchically ordered (poodles \nare a kind of dog, which are a kind of quadruped, which are a kind of\nanimal, etc.). Similarly, the planning and execution of \nnon-linguistic actions seems often to involve the sequencing and \ncombining of smaller behavioral units into larger wholes. Recursion \nmight well be an important part of the human language faculty, but \nit's apparently not specific either to us or to that faculty. Or, to \nput the point more bluntly: if it's Chomsky's view that recursiveness\nis the pivotal feature of the language faculty, and if recursiveness \nis a feature of human cognition and action more generally, then it's \nnot clear that Chomsky remains a linguistic \n nativist.[26]\n\n3.5 Pidgins and Creoles\n\n\nIt has been argued (by, e.g., Bickerton  1981, and Pinker, \n1994:32-9) that the process by which a pidgin turns into a creole \nprovides direct evidence of the operation of an innate language \nfaculty. Pidgins are rudimentary communication systems that are \ndeveloped when people speaking different languages come together \n(often in a commercial setting or when one people has conquered and \nis exploiting another) and need to communicate about practical \nmatters. Creoles arise when pidgins are elaborated both syntactically\nand semantically, and take on the characteristics of bona \nfide natural languages.\n\n\nBickerton and, following him, Pinker, argue that creolization occurs \nwhen children take a pidgin as the input to their first language \nlearning, and urge that the added complexity of the creole reflects \nthe operation of the child's inborn language faculty. Moreover, they \nargue, since creole languages all tend to be elaborated in the same \nways, and since they all respect the constraints of UG, the \nphenomenon of creolization also supports the idea that the inborn \ncontribution to language acquisition is not just some general drive \nfor an effective system of communication, but rather knowledge of \nlinguistic universals.\n\n\nThere are two problems with this \u2018language bioprogram \nhypothesis,\u2019 as it is known in the creolization literature. The\nfirst concerns the claim (e.g., Bickerton 1981:43-70) that even \ncreoles that developed in quite different areas of the world, and in \ncomplete isolation from one another, bear \u201cuncanny \nresemblances\u201d (Pinker 1994:25) to each other, not just in \nrespecting the constraints of UG, but \u2014 even more surprisingly \n\u2014 in using fundamentally the same means to elaborate their root\npidgins (e.g., in using the same syntactic devices to mark tense, \naspect and modality). The stronger claim made by Bickerton \u2014 \nthat Creoles use the same devices for the same grammatical purposes \n\u2014 is simply not true. For example, as Myhill (1991) argues, \nJamaican Creole, Louisiana Creole, Mauritian Creole and Guyanese \nCreole mark tense, aspect and modality in ways that are quite \ndifferent from those that Bickerton (1981) proposed as universal. \n(See, however, Mufwene 1999 for a case that confirms Bickerton's \npredictions.) The weaker claim \u2014 that creoles respect the \nconstraints imposed by UG \u2014 has not, so far as I know, been \ncontested. So we will assume, in what follows, that creoles, like \nother NLs, respect UG. The important question for our purposes is: \nhow does this come about?\n\n\nThe bioprogram hypothesis claims that creolization occurs as a result\nof the action of the language faculty: children who learn language \nfrom degraded (e.g., pidgin) inputs are compelled by their innate \nknowledge of grammar to produce a fully-fledged natural language (the\ncreole) as output. As an example of how children add UG-constrained \nstructure to languages learned from degraded inputs, Pinker cites the\ncase of Simon, a deaf child studied by Newport and her colleagues, \nwho learned American Sign Language (ASL) from parents who themselves \nwere not exposed to ASL until their late teens. Although they used \nASL as their primary language, Simon's parents were \u201cin many \nways\u2026like pidgin speakers,\u201d says Pinker (1994:38). For \ninstance, they used inflectional markers in an inconsistent way and \noften failed to respect the structure-dependence of the rules \ngoverning topicalization in that \n language.[27]\n But \u201castoundingly,\u201d says Pinker, \u201cthough Simon saw \nno ASL but his parents' defective version, his own signing was far \nbetter ASL then theirs\u2026Simon must somehow have shut out his \nparents' ungrammatical \u2018noise.\u2019 He must have latched on \nto the inflections that his parents used inconsistently, and \ninterpreted them as mandatory.\u201d (1994:39) Pinker views this as \na case of \u201ccreolization by a single living child\u201d \n(ibid.) and explains Simon's conformity to ASL grammar in \nterms of the operation of his innate language faculty during the \nacquisition period.\n\n\nIn a recent overview of the Simon data from the last 10 or so years, \nhowever, Newport 2001, stresses a number of facts that Pinker's \npresentation obscures or downplays. First, Simon's performance was \nnot that of a native signer, although he did develop \u201chis own \nversion of ASL whose structure was more like that of other natural \nlanguages [than that of his parents' ASL]\u201d (Newport 2001:168).\nFor instance, Simon's morphology stabilized at a level that was \n\u201cnot as complex as native ASL\u201d and he didn't acquire \nstandard classifier morphemes if they were not used by his parents \n(ibid.). Secondly, Simon's success in learning a given rule \nseemed to vary with how well or badly his parents signed. For \ninstance, Simon's parents used the correct inflectional morphology \n60-75% of the time for a large class of verbs of motion, and in this \ncase, Simon's own use of such morphology was 90% correct. However, \nsome members of the class of classifier morphemes were correctly used\nby the parents only 40% of the time, and in this case, although \nSimon's performance was better than his parents', it was not at \nnative signer level.\n\n\nNewport argues that Simon appears to be \u2018cleaning up\u2019 his\nparents' language, that is, \u201cbas[ing] his learning heavily on \nhis input, but reorganiz[ing] this input to form a cleaner, more \nrule-governed system than the one to which he was exposed.\u201d \n(2001:168) She agrees that this result could be due to constraints \nimposed by an innate language faculty, but argues that it is also \nconsistent with the existence of some more generalized propensity in \nchildren to generate systematic rules from noisy inputs, rightly \npointing out that the latter hypothesis cannot be ruled out in \nadvance of empirical test. (In this context, she notes (p.170) some \npreliminary studies suggesting that inferring systematic rules from \nmessy data may indeed be a more general feature of learning in young \nchildren (though, interestingly, not in adults), for they can be seen\nto exhibit this tendency in non-linguistic pattern-learning contexts \ntoo.) Newport concludes that \u201cthe contrasts between Simon and \nhis parents are in certain ways less extreme, and more \nreorganizational, than might be suggested by the Language Bioprogram \nHypothesis\u2026[H]e does not appear to be creating an entirely new\nlanguage from his own innate specifications; rather, he appears to be\nfollowing the predominant tendencies of his input, but he sharpens \nthem, extends them, and forces them to be internally \nconsistent.\u201d (2001:173).\n\n\nIf Newport et al. are right, the case of Simon does not seem to give \nmuch support to the nativist hypothesis. Moreover, the argument from \ncreolization suffers a number of additional flaws. First, the \nBickerton-Pinker view, which assigns a dominant role to child \nlanguage learners in the creation of creoles, is but one of three \ncompeting hypotheses currently being explored in the creolization \nliterature. According to the \u2018superstratist\u2019 hypothesis, \ncreolization occurs not when children acquire language from pidgins, \nbut when successive waves of adult speakers try to learn the language\nof the dominant culture as a second language. (Chaudenson 1992, for \ninstance, defends this view about the origins of French creoles.) On \nthis view, the additional devices seen in creoles are corruptions of \ndevices seen in the dominant language. According to the \n\u2018substratist\u2019 hypothesis, creoles are again created by \nsecond language learners, rather than children, only the source of \nadded structure is the first language of the learner. (Lumsden 1999 \nargues that numerous traces of a variety of African languages in \nHaitian creole support this hypothesis.) One need not take a stand on\nwhich of these views is correct in order to see that these competing \nexplanations of creolization undermine Bickerton and Pinker's \n\u2018bioprogram\u2019 hypothesis. If creoles arise out of the \nattempts of adult learners to learn (and subsequently pass on to \ntheir children) another, non-native language, then what one might \ncall \u2018contamination of the stimulus,\u2019 rather than the \ninfluence of an inborn UG in the learner, is what accounts for the \nUG-respecting ways in which creoles are elaborated.\n\n\nHowever, there is a case of creolization in which these other \nhypotheses apparently fail to gain purchase, as Pinker (1994:37ff.) \nemphasizes. This is the case of the development of Idioma de Signos \nNicarag\u00fcense (ISN, Nicaraguan Sign Language), a brand-new \nnatural sign language which first emerged around 30 years ago in \nschools for the deaf in and around Managua. These schools were first \nset up in the 1970s, and ISN evolved from the hodge-podge of homesign\nsystems used by students who entered the schools at that time. ISN is\nan interesting test case of the bioprogram hypothesis for two \nreasons. First, homesign systems are idiosyncratic and possess little\nsyntactic structure: the natural-languagelike syntax of ISN could \ntherefore not derive from substrate influence. And Spanish, the only \npotential candidate for superstrate influence was allegedly \ninaccessible to signers because of its auditory modality. Pinker \nclaims that ISN provides another example of creolization and the \nworkings of the innate language faculty: it is \n\u201ccreated\u2026in one leap when the younger children were \nexposed to the pidgin singing of the older children.\u201d \n(1994:36-7)\n\n\nIn their discussion of the development of ISN, however, Kegl, Senghas\nand Coppola (1999) show that things are not quite this \nstraightforward. ISN did not develop \u2018in one leap,\u2019 from \nthe very rudimentary homesigns or \u2018Mimicas\u2019 spoken by \nindividual deaf students. Instead, its evolution was more gradual and\nwas preceded by the creation of what Kegl et al. call \u201cLenguage\nde Signos Nicarag\u00fcense\u201d (LSN), a kind of \u201cpidgin or \njargon\u201d (181) that \u201cdeveloped from the point when these \nhomesigners came together in the schools and began to share their \nhomesigns with each other, quickly leading to more and more shared \nsigns and grammatical devices\u201d (180). In addition, the signers \nhad access to Spanish language dictionaries, and their language was \nalso influenced by the signing of Spanish-speaking, non-deaf teachers\nat the schools \u2014 signing which likely incorporated such \ngrammatical devices of the teachers' language as were transferable to\na non-vocal medium. (K. Stromswold, private communication.)\n\n\nWhile Kegl et al. endorse the language bioprogram hypothesis that ISN\nemerged \u2018in one leap,\u2019 in the minds of children exposed \nto degraded Mimica or LSN inputs, their data are equally consistent \nwith the idea that ISN developed more gradually by means of \nsuccessive elaborations and innovations among a community of \nhighly-motivated (because language-starved) young users. Indeed, as \nKegl et al. themselves describe the history (p.187), this is \nprecisely what happened. First, a group of signers, each with his or \nher own idiosyncratic form of Mimicas, entered the schools. Members \nof this group gained in expressive power as their individual Mimicas \nwere enriched by borrowings from others' homesign systems. Then, a \nnew cohort of Mimicas signers entered the schools. Their sign systems\nbenefitted both from exposure to the Mimicas of their peers and from \nexposure to the richer system developed by the earlier group. Through\na process of successive elaborations in this manner, LSN developed \nand then, by a similar series of steps, ISN developed. At present, \nall three sign systems are still being used in Nicaragua, presumably \nreflecting the different ages at which people are exposed to language\nand the kinds of inputs (ISN or LSN vs. signed and written Spanish or\nlipreading in regular schools) they receive. In addition, ISN and to \na lesser extent LSN are still constantly changing \u2014 as one \nwould expect if ISN were a community-wide work in progress, not the \nfinished product of an individual child's mind,\n3.6 Developmental Language Disorders and the Search for \u2018Language Genes\u2019\n\n\nDissociations of language disorders acquired in adulthood (e.g., \nBroca's and Wernicke's aphasia) may tell us something about how \nlanguage is organized in the mature brain, but cannot tell us much \nabout how language is acquired or the role of innate knowledge in \nthat process \u2014 a fact that nativists about language generally \nacknowledge. By contrast, language dissociations arising during \nchildhood are sometimes held to bear strongly on the question of \nwhether language is innate. Pinker (1994:297-314) articulates this \nlatter line of thought, arguing that there is a double dissociation \nbetween \u2018general intelligence\u2019 and language in two \ndevelopmental disorders called Williams Syndrome (WS) and Specific \nLanguage Impairment (SLI). People with WS have IQs well below the \nnormal range (50-60), yet are able to speak fluently and engagingly \nabout many topics. Those with SLI, by contrast, have normal \n(\u224890) non-verbal intelligence but speak effortfully and slowly,\nfrequently making errors in their production and comprehension of \nsentences and words. Pinker argues that there is a double \ndissociation here, and that it supports the view that there is a \nspecial \u2018language acquisition device\u2019 that is separable \nfrom any general learning abilities children might possess. In \naddition, following Gopnik 1990a,b, and Gopnik and Crago 1991, he \nurges that the fact that the dissociation appears to concern aspects \nof syntax in particular indicates that the language faculty in \nquestion is the grammar faculty. Finally, and again following Gopnik,\nhe argues that since SLI appears to run in families and, in at least \none case, displays a Mendelian inheritance pattern, what we have here\nis evidence not just of a \u2018grammar faculty,\u2019 but of a \n\u2018grammar gene.\u2019\n3.6.1 Williams Syndrome\n\n\nWS is a rare genetic disorder with a complex phenotype. Physically, \nWS individuals display dismorphic facial features, abnormal growth \npatterns, gastrointestinal problems, early puberty, neurological \nabnormalities (including hypotonia, hyperreflexia, hyperacuisis and \ncerebellar dysfunction), defective vision and eye development, bad \nteeth, connective tissue abnormalities, and heart problems. \nPsychologically, in addition to their low non-verbal IQ and \ncomparatively spared language abilities, they display relatively good\naudiovisual memory but very impaired visual-spatial abilities, \nleading to difficulties in daily life (e.g., getting dressed). They \nhave outgoing personalities and are highly sociable to the point of \noverfriendliness, but also display numerous behavioral and emotional \nproblems (especially hyperactivity and difficulty concentrating in \nchildhood, and anxiety in later life). (Morris and Mervis 2000; \nMervis et al. 2000.)\n\n\nAs to their language, there is currently a debate in the literature\nwith regard to its normalcy. According to one point of view, the\nlinguistic competence of WS individuals is remarkably normal,\nespecially in comparison with that of similarly retarded individuals,\nsuch as those with Downs syndrome (Pinker 1994, 1997; Clahsen and\nAlmazan 1998; Bello et al. 2004; Bellugi et\nal. 1998). While rather unusual in their choice of words (e.g.,\nproducing chihuahua, ibis and condor in addition to\nmore usual animal words in a word fluency test) and despite\nan excessive use of clich\u00e9s and social stock-phrases, their\nability to use language, especially in conversational contexts, is\nmore or less intact. For example, they may appear relatively normal in\nsocial interactions, and their processing of conditional questions and\nability to repeat sentences with complex syntax is closer to that of\nnormal controls than to matched Downs syndrome controls\n(Bellugi et al. 2000: 13, 15).\n\n\nAccording to another school of thought, however, the language \nabilities of WS subjects might be more normal than those of Downs \nsyndrome individuals, and might look remarkable in contrast to their \nown marked disabilities in other areas, but nonetheless display a \nnumber of abnormal characteristics across a variety of measures when \ninvestigated further. WS language shows \u201cmassively \ndelayed\u201d early acquisition, especially of vocabulary (Bellugi \net al. 2000:11) and grammatical morphemes (Caprirci et\nal. 1996); overregularization of regular plural and past tense\nendings as well defective competence with regard to irregular nouns\nand verbs (Clahsen and Almazan 2001); \u201cinordinate difficulty\nwith morphosyntax\u201d (Morris and Mervis 2000: 467; see also\nVolterra et al. 1996; Karmiloff-Smith et al. 1997;\nLevy and Hermon 2003); and impaired mastery of relative clause\nconstructions (Grant et al., 2002), embedded sentences, and\n(in French) grammatical gender assignment (Karmiloff-Smith et\nal. 1997). Indeed, Bellugi et al., 2000, found that WS\nchildren's performance on a sentence-repetition task was\nindistinguishable from that of matched controls diagnosed with\nSpecific Language Impariment, or SLI (see below, \u00a73.6.2).\nFindings such as these lead experts such as Annette Karmilloff-Smith\nto urge \u201cdethroning the myth\u201d of WS' \u201cintact\u201d\nsyntactic abilities (Karmiloff-Smith et al. 2003) and move\nUrsula Bellugi \u2014 formerly a proponent of the \u2018spared\nlanguage\u2019 viewpoint \u2014 to caution that \u201cbecause their\nlanguage abilities are often at a level that is higher than their\noverall cognitive abilities, individuals with WMS might be perceived\nto be more capable than they really are.\u201d (Bellugi et\nal. 1999.)\n\n\nIn contrast to its cognitive profile, which is, as we have seen, a \nsubject of debate, the genetic basis of WS is known. It results from \na \u22481.5 Mb deletion encompassing the elastin gene ELN at \nchromosome 7q11.23; most cases appear to be due to new mutations. ELN\nis crucial in synthesizing elastin, a protein which holds cells \ntogether in the elastic fibers found in connective tissues throughout\nthe body and in especially high concentrations in cartilege, \nligaments and arterial walls. Failure to synthesize this protein \ndisrupts development in numerous ways, from the first trimester \nonwards, and gives rise through processes that are not well \nunderstood to the raft of symptoms associated with the syndrome. \n(Morris and Mervis 2000; Mervis et al. 2000.)\n3.6.2 Specific Language Impairment\n\n\nIn contrast with Williams syndrome, in which one sees comparatively \nspared language in the face of mild to moderate mental retardation \nand numerous physical defects, specific language impairment \n(\u2018SLI\u2019) is diagnosed when (i) non-verbal intelligence as \nmeasured by standard IQ tests is normal; (ii) verbal IQ is well below\nnormal; and (iii) obvious causes of language impairment (e.g., \ndeafness, frank neurological damage) can be ruled out. As one might \nexpect given these diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of SLI embraces a\nhighly heterogeneous collection of language-related deficits, not all\nof which co-occur in every case of language impairment. (Bishop, \n1994; Bishop et al,. 2000.) These include:\n\nproductive and receptive phonological deficits (e.g., difficulty\nproducing clusters of consonants, as in spectacle, and\nfailure to show categorical perception of phonemes differentiated by\nplace of articulation (/ba/ vs. /ga/) and voicing (/ba/ vs. /pa/);\nmorphological deficits (e.g., generation of past tenses or plurals\nby using affixes);\n productive and receptive syntactic deficits (e.g., analyzing\n\u2018reversible\u2019 passives (Katie kissed Jacob\nvs. Jacob was kissed by Katie), complex dative constructions\n(e.g., Katie gave Jacob the book) and anaphora (e.g.,\nKatie said that Sarah scratched her vs.  Katie said that\nSarah scratched herself).\n\n\n\nAs a consequence of this heterogeneity, SLI, researchers have \nintroduced a number of subtypes of the disorder, including such \nthings as \u2018Verbal auditory agnosia,\u2019 \n\u2018Lexical-syntactic deficit syndrome\u2019 and \n\u2018Phonological programming syndrome\u2019 (Bishop 1994). Also \nas a consequence, and in part because studies do not always \ndistinguish between different subtypes, the etiology of SLI in \ngeneral is not well understood (O'Brien et al. 2003), although \nrecent research suggests at least two distinct genetic loci are \ninvolved in at least some subtypes of the disorder (Bishop 2006). \nSome posit an underlying defect in the \u2018grammar module.\u2019 \nFor instance, Rice and Wexler (1996) attribute SLI individuals' \nmorphological deficits to a missing UG principle, namely, the \nprinciple of inflection, and Van der Laly and Stollwerk 1997, \nattribute some SLI children's difficulty with anaphora to their \nfailure to acquire Binding Theory. Others see non-linguistic defects,\nsuch as auditory, memory or processing deficits as the root problem. \nFor instance, Tallal 1980, 1985 argue that many SLI cases result \nfrom deficits in the processing of rapid auditory stimuli, giving \nrise to a failure to learn to distinguish phonemes correctly, which \nin turn leads to a failure to acquire other aspects of grammar. \nOthers, such as and Norbury, Bishop and Briscoe 2002 argue that such \nchildren's limited processing capacities are the culprit.\n\n\nWhile the varied symptomatology of SLI suggests that no unified \ntheory of its etiology might be forthcoming, the cause of the \ndisorder is comparatively well understood in the case of one subtype,\ninvolving a severe disruption of morphosyntax (i.e., the rules \ngoverning the formation of words from smaller semantic units, or \nmorphemes). This subtype, seen in about half the members of a large, \nthree-generation English family, the KE's, and in another, unrelated \nindividual, has been traced to a specific genetic mutation, the \nfunction of which is actively under investigation.\n\n\nThe KE family has received much press since the early 1990s, when \nGopnik 1990a,b and Gopnik and Crago 1991 (see also Gopnik 1997) \nproposed that their morphosyntactic deficits were caused by a \nmutation in a single dominant gene normally responsible for the \nencoding of grammatical features, such as function words and the \ninflections used to mark number, tense, aspect, etc. According to \nGopnik, the affected KE's are \u2018feature blind\u2019 as a \nconsequence of this mutation. And according to Pinker (1994), their \npedigree (Fig. 6) and specifically morphosyntactic deficits \nconstitutes \u201csuggestive evidence for grammar genes \u2026 \ngenes whose effects seem most specific to the development of the \ncircuits underlying parts of grammar\u201d (Pinker 1994:325).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. The KE family pedigree \n (Image used by permission of Simon E. Fisher)\n \n\n\n\nOther intensive studies of the KE family, by Vargha-Khadem and\ncolleagues (e.g., Vargha-Khadem et al 1995, 1998;\nWatkins et al., 2002) have vigorously disputed the hypothesis\nthat the root cause of the KE's language disorder is a syntactic\ndeficit. Instead, they argue, the KE phenotype is much broader than\nGopnik's account suggests, and their \u2018feature blindness\u2019\nis merely one among the many effects of an underlying articulatory\nproblem. As characterized by Vargha-Khadem's team, the affected KE's\nspeech is effortful, \u201csometimes agrammatical and often\nunintelligible\u201d (Watkins et al. 2002:453), and shows\nimpairments not just in morphosyntax (e.g., regular plural and past\ntense endings) but also in the formation of irregular past tenses\n(where correct usage is lexically determined, rather than\nrule-governed) and in sentence-level syntax, particularly word order.\nComprehension, too, is impaired at the level of syntax as well as\nwords, and as is their reading of both words and non-words. These\nresults indicate that the KE's problems go beyond morphosyntax, and\nthe fact that affected KE's have significantly lower non-verbal IQs\n(by 18-19 points; Vargha-Khadem et al. 1995) than unaffected\nfamily members indicates that their deficits may be further reaching\n still.[28]\n Finally, affected KE's have trouble sequencing and executing\nnon-language-related face, mouth and tongue movements and show\nabnormal activation not just of speech but also of motor areas on fMRI\nscans (Liegeois, et al. 2003); this deficiency in\n\u2018orofacial praxis\u2019 supports Vargha-Khadem's hypothesis\nthat the root problem for the KE's is articulatory.\n\n\nAs Gopnik noted, the pattern of inheritance in the KE family suggests\nthat a single, dominant gene is responsible for the disorder. (See\nfig. 6) In the early 1990's, Fisher and colleagues began working to\nisolate the gene. First, it was localized to a region on chromosome\n7q31 containing about 100 genes (Fisher et al. 1997, 1998;\nO'Brien et al. 2003). Later, it was identified (Lai et\nal. 2001; Fisher et al. 2003) as the gene FOXP2, which encodes a\nregulatory protein or \u2018transcription factor\u2019 (i.e., a\nprotein that helps to regulate the rate of transcription of other\ngenes in the genome \u2014 in the case of FOXP2, the protein acts to\ninhibit transcription of the downstream gene(s)). In affected family\nmembers, a single base-pair substitution in the gene coding for this\nregulatory protein leads to the insertion of the amino acid arginine\n(instead of the normal histamine) in an area of the protein (viz., the\n\u2018forkhead binding domain\u2019) that is critical for its\nability to modulate the transcription of the downstream DNA. As a\nconsequence, FOXP2 cannot perform its normal regulatory role in\naffected KE family members.\n\n\nThe failure of FOXP2 to perform its normal role in turn leads to\nabnormal brain development in affected KE individuals. Studies of\nother animals and humans (e.g., Lai et al. 2003;\nTakahashi et al., 2003; Ferland et al. 2003;\nTeramitsu et al. 2004) show that FOXP2 is normally highly\nexpressed in both development and adulthood in two distinct brain\ncircuits, One is a corticostriatal circuit, in which inputs from the\nprefrontal and premotor cortex are modulated by the basal ganglia and\nthe thalamus, and then sent back to prefrontal and premotor cotical\nareas; the other is an olivocerebellar circuit, in which sensory input\nis sent via the spinal cord for processing in the medulla, cerebellum\nand thalamus before being handed on to prefrontal cortex. (See\nfig. 7.) The basal ganglia are known to be involved in the sequencing\nand reward-based learning of motor behaviors (Graybiel 1995, 1998),\nand the cerebellar circuit, while less well understood, is thought to\nbe a proprioceptive circuit involved in motor regulation and\ncoordination (Lieberman 2002). FOXP2 is expressed in homologues of\nthese areas in other species (e.g., canaries, zebra finches, rats) and\nin all species studied, these areas are involved in motor sequencing\nand coordination (Sharff and White 2004).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Two circuits in which FOXP2 is expressed. (Based on figures\nby Diana Weedman Molavi, The Washington University School of Medicine\n\n Neuroscience Tutorial).\n \n\n\nSo, what appears to be the case is that affected KE family members' \nlanguage difficulties result from a mutation in the FOXP2 gene, which\nresults in abnormal development of the striatal, cerebellar and \ncortical areas necessary for the sequencing and coordination of \nspeech-related movements of the mouth, tongue and possibly larynx; \nMRI scans of affected family members showing reduced gray matter \ndensity in these areas support this hypothesis, as do fMRI scans \nshowing abnormal striatal and cortical activation during receptive \nand active language processing (Belton et al. 2003; Liegeois, et \nal. 2003.)\n\n\nVargha-Khadem speculates (cf. Watkins et al. 2002:463) that those of\nthe KE's deficits that do not appear to be motor related (e.g., their\ncomprehension and reading problems, their difficulties with word \norder and syntax) are a result of impaired learning that itself \nresults from their motor deficits. For instance, impaired \narticulation could lead to impoverished phonological representations,\nwhich would then impair the acquisition of morphological and \nmorphosyntactic knowledge, which would then constitute a poor basis \nfor further syntactic learning. Impaired representation at all of \nthese levels would then express itself in receptive language and \nreading, as well as in the realm of spoken language. Another possible\nexplanation of the KE's non-articulatory deficits, which is not \nnecessarily in competition with the previous one, derives from the \nfact that the basal ganglia are also known to be implicated in \nworking memory (Bosnan 2004) and reward-based learning (e.g., \nclassical conditioning) that is mediated by dopaminergic circuits \nthat interact with basilar structures (Lieberman 2002). If \nreward-based learning and working memory are impaired in the KE's, \nthen this could explain not only their higher-level syntactic \ndeficits, but also their overall lower IQ (Lieberman 2002).\n\n\nNeither of these explanations of the KE's seems especially congenial \nto the linguistic nativist. For both tacitly assume that language \nlearning, including syntactic learning, is not (or not entirely) \nsubserved by special-purpose mechanisms. Rather, it is mediated by \nmore general motor circuitry (according to the Vargha-Khadem \nhypothesis) or reward-based learning and working memory abilities \n(according to Lieberman) that are also involved in other learning \ntasks.\n\n\nOn the other hand, however, there is evidence that FOXP2 is\nparticularly implicated in vocal learning and expression. First, it is\nhighly expressed in songbirds that modify their innate vocal\nrepertoires: in canaries it is expressed seasonally, when adult birds\nmodify their songs (Teramitsu et al. 2004) and in zebra\nfinches, it is expressed more at the time when young birds learn their\nsongs (Haessler et al. 2004). In addition, there is evidence\nthat the variant of the FOXP2 gene that is present in humans has\nundergone strong positive selection in the hominid line (Enard et\nal 2002; Zhang et al. 2002). The protein produced by\nhuman FOXP2 differs in just three out of its 715 constituent amino\nacids from that of the mouse, and a recent analysis (Zhang et\nal. 2003) indicates that two of these differences are unique to\nthe hominid lineage. According to Enard et al 2002, the fact\nthat these two differences are fixed in the human genome, whereas no\nfixed substitutions occurred in the lineage of our closest relatives,\nthe chimpanzees, suggests that those changes were strongly selected\nfor in our lineage; Enard et al.  put the date of fixation of\nthese changes in the human population at around 200,000 years\nago. This date accords well with at least some estimates of the\nemergence of modern human language, suggesting that the vocal\ncapacities underwritten by FOXP2 \u2014 and impaired in those lacking\nthe gene \u2014 are after all critical to language competence.\n3.6.3 The grammar module and the genetics of language\n\n\nAt this point, two questions arise. First, is there a double \ndissociation between language capacities and general cognitive \ncapacities to be found in a comparison of Williams syndrome and SLI? \nSecond, what does our current knowledge of the role of FOXP2 in \nlanguage development tell us about linguistic nativism?\n\n\nAs to the first question, there seems to be no double dissociation. \nFirst of all, WS individuals' language, while startling in contrast \nwith their level of mental retardation, is not normal; indeed, as we \nhave seen, it is indistinguishable on some tests from that of \nlanguage impaired individuals. In addition, as Thomas and \nKarmiloff-Smith 2002, caution, it is not at all clear that one can \nassume, in the case of a pervasive developmental disorder like \nWilliams syndrome, that apparently \u2018intact\u2019 competences \nare a result of normal development of the underlying neurological and\npsychological structures. That is, given the known capacity of the \nbrain to compensate for deficits in one area by cobbling together a \nsolution in another, one cannot assume that there is a \n\u2018language module\u2019 in WS patients which develops more or \nless normally despite other cognitive systems' being massively \ndisrupted. Thomas and Karmiloff-Smith argue that the numerous \ndiscrepancies between WS language development and that of normal \nchildren suggests that this \u2018residual normality\u2019 \nassumption is misguided in this case, thus undermining the claim that\nwhat is spared in WS is \u2018the language (or grammar) \nmodule.\u2019\n\n\nMoving to the other side of the dissociation, since it is hard to say\nexactly what about language is disrupted in cases of SLI, it is\ndifficult to determine whether this disruption is specific to\nlanguage, let alone grammar. While researchers like Van der Lely and\nChristian 2000, and van der Lely and Ullman 2001 argue that there is\na purely grammatical form of the deficit, which does support the\nhypothesis of a grammar module, this is controversial, as we have seen\nabove. Certainly consideration of the KE's does not support such a\nhypothesis. Their root deficit appears to concern orofacial praxis,\nrather than language specifically; and in addition, their\n\u2018general intelligence,\u2019 as measured by tests of non-verbal\nintelligence, while \u201cnormal,\u201d nonetheless appears to have\nbeen affected by their neurological and/or linguistic abnormalities\n\u2014 witness their scores 18-19 points lower than those of their\nrelatives. It is, in other words, unclear that there is any\ndissociation of language and general intelligence in this case at\nall. One can conclude that as things stand now, SLI seems to be so\nheterogeneous a disorder as to defy neat characterization, and that\nconsideration of this disorder does not support the view that there is\na language or grammar module that functions independently of other\ncognitive processes.\n\n\nThe second question asked above was: what can be learned about the \ninnate basis of language from a consideration of the KE's and FOXP2. \nIn a recent article, Marcus and Fisher (2003) argue that the kinds of\nresults discussed above offer valuable insights into the ways that \nlanguage is implemented in the brain and controlled (to the extent \nthat it is) by the genes. However, they refrain \u2014 rightly in my\nview \u2014 from drawing morals to the effect that FOXP2 is a \n\u201cgene for language\u201d or even \u201cfor \narticulation.\u201d The effects of FOXP2 are wider than this (it is \nexpressed in the developing heart and lungs, in addition to the brain\n-- REF) and the functions of the neural circuits in which it is \nactive are as yet too poorly understood to do more than gesture at \nthe ways in which FOXP2 is involved in constructing the human \nlinguistic phenotype.\n\n\nAll the topics covered in \u00a73 deserve books of their own. My aim\nhere has been to sketch the ways in which modern understanding of the\nmind reveals the inadequacy and implausibility of the claim that\nhumans have innate representations of UG that are responsible for\ntheir acquisition of language. There are likely many, many processes\nimplicated in the attainment of linguistic competence, that many of\nthem are likely specialized by natural selection for linguistic tasks,\nbut that many of them also retain their other, and older,\nfunctions. The linguistic nativist's theory views our acquisition of\ngrammatical competence as a simple matter \u2014 one that\ncan be described at one level of explanation, and in terms of a single\nkind of process. This is very unlikely to be the case. Multiple\nsystems and multiple processes are at work in the acquisition of\nlinguistic knowledge, and our understanding of language acquisition,\nwhen it comes, is likely to involve theories of many kinds and at many\ndifferent levels, and to resemble the theory of the Chomskyan nativist\nin few or no\n respects.[29]\n",
