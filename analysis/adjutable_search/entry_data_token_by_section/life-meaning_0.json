    "main_text": "The Meaning of \u201cMeaning\u201d\n1. The Meaning of \u201cMeaning\u201d\n\nOne of the field's aims\u00a0consists of the systematic attempt to\nidentify what people (essentially or characteristically) have in mind\nwhen they think about the topic\u00a0of life\u2019s meaning.\u00a0For\nmany in the field, terms such as \u201cimportance\u201d and\n\u201csignificance\u201d are synonyms of\n\u201cmeaningfulness\u201d and so are insufficiently revealing, but\nthere are those who draw a distinction between meaningfulness and\nsignificance (Singer 1996, 112\u201318; Belliotti 2019, 145\u201350,\n186). There is also debate about how the concept of a meaningless life\nrelates to the ideas of a life that is absurd (Nagel 1970, 1986,\n214\u201323; Feinberg 1980; Belliotti 2019), futile (Trisel 2002),\nand not worth living (Landau 2017, 12\u201315; Matheson 2017).\n\nA useful way to begin to get clear about what thinking about\nlife\u2019s meaning involves is to specify the bearer. Which life\ndoes the inquirer have in mind? A standard distinction to draw is\nbetween the meaning \u201cin\u201d life, where a human person is\nwhat can exhibit meaning, and the meaning \u201cof\u201d life in a\nnarrow sense, where the human species as a whole is what can be\nmeaningful or not. There has also been a bit of recent consideration\nof whether animals or human infants can have meaning in their lives,\nwith most rejecting that possibility (e.g., Wong 2008, 131, 147;\nFischer 2019, 1\u201324), but a handful of others beginning to make a\ncase for it (Purves and Delon 2018; Thomas 2018). Also under-explored\nis the issue of whether groups, such as a people or an organization,\ncan be bearers of meaning, and, if so, under what conditions.\n\nMost analytic philosophers have been interested in meaning in life,\nthat is, in the meaningfulness that a person\u2019s life could\nexhibit, with comparatively few these days addressing the meaning of\nlife in the narrow sense. Even those who believe that God is or would\nbe central to life\u2019s meaning have lately addressed how an\nindividual\u2019s life might be meaningful in virtue of God more\noften than how the human race might be. Although some have argued that\nthe meaningfulness of human life as such merits inquiry to no less a\ndegree (if not more) than the meaning in a life (Seachris 2013;\nTartaglia 2015; cf. Trisel 2016), a large majority of the field has\ninstead been interested in whether their lives as individual persons\n(and the lives of those they care about) are meaningful and how they\ncould become more so.\n\nFocusing on meaning in life, it is quite common to maintain that it is\nconceptually something good for its own sake or, relatedly, something\nthat provides a basic reason for action (on which see Visak 2017).\nThere are a few who have recently suggested otherwise, maintaining\nthat there can be neutral or even undesirable kinds of meaning in a\nperson\u2019s life (e.g., Mawson 2016, 90, 193; Thomas 2018, 291,\n294). However, these are outliers, with most analytic philosophers,\nand presumably laypeople, instead wanting to know when an\nindividual\u2019s life exhibits a certain kind of final value (or\nnon-instrumental reason for action).\n\nAnother claim about which there is substantial consensus is that\nmeaningfulness is not all or nothing and instead comes in degrees,\nsuch that some periods of life are more meaningful than others and\nthat some lives as a whole are more meaningful than others. Note that\none can coherently hold the view that some people\u2019s lives are\nless meaningful (or even in a certain sense less\n\u201cimportant\u201d) than others, or are even meaningless\n(unimportant), and still maintain that people have an equal standing\nfrom a moral point of view. Consider a consequentialist moral\nprinciple according to which each individual counts for one in virtue\nof having a capacity for a meaningful life, or a Kantian approach\naccording to which all people have a dignity in virtue of their\ncapacity for autonomous decision-making, where meaning is a function\nof the exercise of this capacity. For both moral outlooks, we could be\nrequired to help people with relatively meaningless lives.\n\nYet another relatively uncontroversial element of the concept of\nmeaningfulness in respect of individual persons is that it is\nlogically distinct from happiness or rightness (emphasized in Wolf\n2010, 2016). First, to ask whether someone\u2019s life is meaningful\nis not one and the same as asking whether her life is pleasant or she\nis subjectively well off. A life in an experience machine or virtual\nreality device would surely be a happy one, but very few take it to be\na prima facie candidate for meaningfulness (Nozick 1974: 42\u201345).\nIndeed, a number would say that one\u2019s life logically could\nbecome meaningful precisely by sacrificing one\u2019s well-being,\ne.g., by helping others at the expense of one\u2019s self-interest.\nSecond, asking whether a person\u2019s existence over time is\nmeaningful is not identical to considering whether she has been\nmorally upright; there are intuitively ways to enhance meaning that\nhave nothing to do with right action or moral virtue, such as making a\nscientific discovery or becoming an excellent dancer. Now, one might\nargue that a life would be meaningless if, or even because, it were\nunhappy or immoral, but that would be to posit a synthetic,\nsubstantive relationship between the concepts, far from indicating\nthat speaking of \u201cmeaningfulness\u201d is analytically a matter\nof connoting ideas regarding happiness or rightness. The question of\nwhat (if anything) makes a person\u2019s life meaningful is\nconceptually distinct from the questions of what makes a life happy or\nmoral, although it could turn out that the best answer to the former\nquestion appeals to an answer to one of the latter questions.\n\nSupposing, then, that talk of \u201cmeaning in life\u201d connotes\nsomething good for its own sake that can come in degrees and that is\nnot analytically equivalent to happiness or rightness, what else does\nit involve? What more can we say about this final value, by\ndefinition? Most contemporary analytic philosophers would say that the\nrelevant value is absent from spending time in an experience machine\n(but see Goetz 2012 for a different view) or living akin to Sisyphus,\nthe mythic figure doomed by the Greek gods to roll a stone up a hill\nfor eternity (famously discussed by Albert Camus and Taylor 1970). In\naddition, many would say that the relevant value is typified by the\nclassic triad of \u201cthe good, the true, and the beautiful\u201d\n(or would be under certain conditions). These terms are not to be\ntaken literally, but instead are rough catchwords for beneficent\nrelationships (love, collegiality, morality), intellectual reflection\n(wisdom, education, discoveries), and creativity (particularly the\narts, but also potentially things like humor or gardening).\n\nPressing further, is there something that the values of the good, the\ntrue, the beautiful, and any other logically possible sources of\nmeaning involve? There is as yet no consensus in the field. One\nsalient view is that the concept of meaning in life is a cluster or\namalgam of overlapping ideas, such as fulfilling higher-order\npurposes, meriting substantial esteem or admiration, having a\nnoteworthy impact, transcending one\u2019s animal nature, making\nsense, or exhibiting a compelling life-story (Markus 2003; Thomson\n2003; Metz 2013, 24\u201335; Seachris 2013, 3\u20134; Mawson 2016).\nHowever, there are philosophers who maintain that something much more\nmonistic is true of the concept, so that (nearly) all thought about\nmeaningfulness in a person\u2019s life is essentially about a single\nproperty. Suggestions include being devoted to or in awe of\nqualitatively superior goods (Taylor 1989, 3\u201324), transcending\none\u2019s limits (Levy 2005), or making a contribution (Martela\n2016).\n\nRecently there has been something of an \u201cinterpretive\nturn\u201d in the field, one instance of which is the strong view\nthat meaning-talk is logically about whether and how a life is\nintelligible within a wider frame of reference (Goldman 2018,\n116\u201329; Seachris 2019; Thomas 2019; cf. Repp 2018). According to\nthis approach, inquiring into life\u2019s meaning is nothing other\nthan seeking out sense-making information, perhaps a narrative about\nlife or an explanation of its source and destiny. This analysis has\nthe advantage of promising to unify a wide array of uses of the term\n\u201cmeaning.\u201d However, it has the disadvantages of being\nunable to capture the intuitions that meaning in life is essentially\ngood for its own sake (Landau 2017, 12\u201315), that it is not\nlogically contradictory to maintain that an ineffable condition is\nwhat confers meaning on life (as per Cooper 2003, 126\u201342;\nBennett-Hunter 2014; Waghorn 2014), and that often human actions\nthemselves (as distinct from an interpretation of them), such as\nrescuing a child from a burning building, are what bear meaning.\n\nSome thinkers have suggested that a complete analysis of the concept\nof life\u2019s meaning should include what has been called\n\u201canti-matter\u201d (Metz 2002, 805\u201307, 2013, 63\u201365,\n71\u201373) or \u201canti-meaning\u201d (Campbell and Nyholm 2015;\nEgerstrom 2015), conditions that reduce the meaningfulness of a life.\nThe thought is that meaning is well represented by a bipolar scale,\nwhere there is a dimension of not merely positive conditions, but also\nnegative ones. Gratuitous cruelty or destructiveness are prima facie\ncandidates for actions that not merely fail to add meaning, but also\nsubtract from any meaning one\u2019s life might have had.\n\nDespite the ongoing debates about how to analyze the concept of\nlife\u2019s meaning (or articulate the definition of the phrase\n\u201cmeaning in life\u201d), the field remains in a good position\nto make progress on the other key questions posed above, viz., of what\nwould make a life meaningful and whether any lives are in fact\nmeaningful. A certain amount of common ground is provided by the point\nthat meaningfulness at least involves a gradient final value in a\nperson\u2019s life that is conceptually distinct from happiness and\nrightness, with exemplars of it potentially being the good, the true,\nand the beautiful. The rest of this discussion addresses philosophical\nattempts to capture the nature of this value theoretically and to\nascertain whether it exists in at least some of our lives.\n",
