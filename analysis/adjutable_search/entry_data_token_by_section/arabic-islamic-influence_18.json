    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The First Cause and the Emanation of the Intelligences\n7. Ethics\n\nThe influence of Arabic ethical and political writings is thin, partly\nbecause Arabic philosophers were less productive in these fields, and\npartly because important works were not translated at all (such as\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Principles of the Citizens of the\nPerfect State) or as late as in the sixteenth century (such as\nAverroes\u2019 Commentary on Plato\u2019s Republic).\nNevertheless, Arabic philosophers, via their teaching on the\nintellect, exerted an important influence on the border area between\nethics and psychology, and on the discussion of human happiness in\nparticular.\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Avicenna and Averroes share the view that\nhappiness is reached through the conjunction of the human intellect\nwith the separate active intellect. They also share an epistemological\noptimism that for specifically gifted people, which they described as\nphilosophers or philosopher-prophets, a perfect conjunction is\npossible in this life. Albertus Magnus\u2019s theory of happiness is\nmuch influenced by these Arabic theories. As was mentioned above, he\nadopted from Avicenna and Averroes the concept of an \u201cacquired\nintellect\u201d (intellectus adeptus) as the highest level\nof conjunction between possible and active intellect. Only in this\nstage, a human being truly becomes a human being. Through the\nconjunction with the active intellect the human intellect contemplates\nthe separate substances, and in this consists the \u201ctheoretical\nhappiness\u201d of man (felicitas contemplativa), a\nhappiness which is possible in this life (De anima III.3.12)\n(M\u00fcller 2006; on Albertus\u2019 influence see de Libera 2005,\n329\u2013361). Thomas Aquinas disagrees with the epistemological\npremisses and the ethical conclusion of this position: Since human\nknowledge is bound to the senses, knowledge of the immaterial\nsubstances is not possible in this life, and neither is perfect human\nhappiness (Summa theol. Ia IIae q.3 a.2). But Thomas, when\nexplaining beatific vision and human happiness in the afterlife,\nadopts from Averroes the idea that a separate substance is conjoined\nwith the human intellect as its form (Comm. on the Sentences\nIV, d.49 q.2 a.1; see Taylor 2012)\n\nIn 1277, several philosophical theses concerning human happiness and\nthe good life were condemned: that happiness is to be had in this life\nand not in another (art. 176), that there is no better state (of life)\nthan studying philosophy (art. 40). These articles were apparently\ndirected at masters of arts at the university of Paris, among them\nSiger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia. As we know from fragments of\nSiger\u2019s treatise On Happiness (De felicitate),\nhe embraces Averroes\u2019 thesis that all intellects are made\nblessed through the conjunction with the active intellect. In\nSiger\u2019s interpretation, human beings in such a state think God\nby an intellection which is God himself. There are many indications\nthat Siger was convinced that the knowledge of the separate substances\nand thus the attaining of human happiness is possible in this life\n(Steel 2001, 227\u2013231). Boethius of Dacia is also convinced that\nhuman happiness can be reached in this life, which is a happiness\nproportioned to human capacities, whereas the highest kind of\nhappiness as such is reserved to the afterlife (in his treatise De\nsummo bono). Boethius appears to be inspired by Arabic theories\nof intellectual ascension, but does not endorse a theory of\nconjunction, as does Siger. His conviction that the\nphilosopher\u2019s life is the only true life echoes the very\nself-confident and elitist stance taken by the major Arabic\nphilosophers.\n",
