    "main_text": "Developments || Incorporating Unawareness\n5.3 Incorporating Unawareness\nThe game models introduced in Section 2 have\nbeen used to describe the uncertainty that the players have about what\ntheir opponents are going to do and are thinking in a game\nsituation. In the analyses provided thus far, the structure\nof the game (i.e., who is playing, what are the preferences of the\ndifferent players, and which actions are available) is assumed to be\ncommon knowledge among the players. However, there are many situations\nwhere the players do not have such complete information about\nthe game. There is no inherent difficulty in using the models\nfrom Section 2 to describe situations where\nplayers are not perfectly informed about the structure of the\ngame (for example, where there is some uncertainty about available\nactions).\nThere is, however, a foundational issue that arises here. Suppose\nthat Ann considers it impossible that her opponent will\nchoose action \\(a\\). Now, there are many reasons why Ann would hold such\nan opinion. On the one hand, Ann may know something about what her\nopponent is going to do or is thinking which allows her to rule out\naction \\(a\\) as a live possibility\u2014i.e., given all the evidence\nAnn has about her opponent, she concludes that action \\(a\\) is just not\nsomething her opponent will do. On the other hand, Ann may not even\nconceive of the possibility that her opponent will choose action\n\\(a\\). She may have a completely different model of the game in mind\nthan her opponents. The foundational question is: Can the game models\nintroduced in Section 2 faithfully represent\nthis latter type of uncertainty?\nThe question is not whether one can formally describe what Ann\nknows and believes under the assumption that she considers it\nimpossible that her opponent will choose action \\(a\\). Indeed, an\nepistemic-probability model where Ann assigns probability zero to the\nevent that her opponent chooses action \\(a\\) is a perfectly good\ndescription of Ann\u2019s epistemic state. The problem is that this\nmodel blurs an important distinction between Ann\nbeing unaware that action \\(a\\) is a live possibility and\nAnn ruling out that action \\(a\\) is a viable option for her\nopponent. This distinction is illustrated by the following snippet\nfrom the well-known Sherlock Holmes\u2019 short story Silver Blaze\n(Doyle 1894):\n\n\u2026I saw by the inspector\u2019s face that his attention had\nbeen keenly aroused.  \u201cYou consider that to be\nimportant?\u201d he [Inspector Gregory] asked.\n\u201cExceedingly so.\u201d \u201cIs there any point to which\nyou would wish to draw my attention?\u201d \u201cTo the\ncurious incident of the dog in the night-time.\u201d \u201cThe\ndog did nothing in the night-time.\u201d \u201cThat was the\ncurious incident,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThe point is that Holmes is aware of a particular event (\u201cthe\ndog not barking\u201d) and uses this to come to a conclusion. The\ninspector is not aware of this event, and so cannot (without\nHolmes\u2019 help) come to the same conclusion. This is true of many\ndetective stories: clever detectives not only have the ability to\n\u201cconnect the dots\u201d, but they are also aware of\nwhich dots need to be connected. Can we describe the inspector\u2019s\nunawareness in an epistemic \nmodel?[17]\nSuppose that \\(U_i(E)\\) is the event that the player \\(i\\) is unaware\nof the event \\(E\\). Of course, if \\(i\\) is unaware of \\(E\\) then \\(i\\) does\nnot know that \\(E\\) is true (\\(U_i(E)\\subseteq\n\\overline{K_i(E)}\\), where \\(\\overline{X}\\) denotes the complement\nof the event \\(X\\)). Recall that in epistemic models (where the\nplayers\u2019 information is described by partitions), we have the\nnegative introspection property:\n\n\\[\\overline{K_i(E)}\\subseteq K_i(\\overline{K_i(E)}).\\] \n\nThis means that if \\(i\\) is unaware of \\(E\\),\nthen \\(i\\) knows that she does not know that \\(E\\). Thus, to capture a\nmore natural definition of \\(U_i(E)\\) where \n\n\\[U_i(E) \\subseteq \\overline{K_i(E)} \\cap \\overline{K_i(\\overline{K_i(E)})},\\] \n\nwe need to\nrepresent the players\u2019 knowledge in a possibility\nstructure where the \\(K_i\\) operators do not necessarily satisfy\nnegative introspection. A possibility structure is a tuple \\(\\langle W,\n\\{P_i\\}_{i\\in\\A}, \\sigma\\rangle\\) where \\(P_i:W\\rightarrow \\pow(W)\\). The\nonly difference with an epistemic model is that the \\(P_i(w)\\) do not\nnecessarily form a partition of \\(W\\). We do not go into details\nhere\u2014see Halpern (1999) for a complete discussion of possibility\nstructures and how they relate to epistemic models. The knowledge\noperator is defined as it is for epistemic models: for each event \\(E\\),\n\\(K_i(E)=\\{w \\mid P_i(w)\\subseteq E\\}\\). However, S. Modica and\nA. Rustichini (1994, 1999) argue that even the more general\npossibility structures cannot be used to describe a player\u2019s\nunawareness.\nA natural definition of unawareness on possibility structures is:\n\n\\[U(E) = \\overline{K(E)} \\cap \\overline{K(\\overline{K(E)})} \\cap\n\\overline{K(\\overline{K(\\overline{K(E)})}}\\cap \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThat is, an agent is unaware of \\(E\\) provided the agent does not\nknow that \\(E\\) obtains, does not know that she does not know that \\(E\\)\nobtains, and so on. Modica and Rustichini use a variant of the above\nSherlock Holmes story to show that there is a problem with this\ndefinition of unawareness.\nSuppose there are two signals: A dog barking (\\(d\\)) and a cat\nhowling (\\(c\\)). Furthermore, suppose there are three states \\(w_1\\),\n\\(w_2\\) in which the dog barks and \\(w_3\\) in which the cat howls. The\nevent that there is no intruder is \\(E=\\{w_1\\}\\) (the lack of the two\nsignals indicates that there was no\nintruder[18]).\n The following possibility structure\n(where there is an arrow from state \\(w\\) to state \\(v\\) provided \\(v\\in\nP(w)\\)) describes the inspector\u2019s epistemic state:\n\n\nFigure 23\n\nConsider the following calculations:\n\n\\(K(E)=\\{w_2\\}\\) (at \\(w_2\\), Watson knows there is a human intruder)\nand \\(-K(E)=\\{w_1,w_3\\}\\)\n\\(K(-K(E))=\\{w_3\\}\\) (at \\(w_3\\), Watson knows that she does not know\n\\(E\\)), and \\(-K(-K(E))=\\{w_1,w_2\\}\\).\n\\(-K(E)\\cap -K(-K(E))=\\{w_1\\}\\) and, in fact, \\(\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty\n(-K)^i(E)=\\{w_1\\}\\)\nLet \\(U(F)=\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty (-K)^i(F)\\). Then,\n\n\\(U(\\emptyset)=U(W)=U(\\{w_1\\})=U(\\{w_2,w_3\\})=\\emptyset\\)\n\\(U(E)=U(\\{w_3\\})=U(\\{w_1,w_3\\})=U(\\{w_1,w_2\\}=\\{w_1\\}\\)\n\n\nSo, \\(U(E)=\\{w_1\\}\\) and \\(U(U(E))=U(\\{w_1\\})=\\emptyset\\). This means\nthat at state \\(w_1\\), the Inspector is unaware of \\(E\\), but is not\nunaware that he is unaware of \\(E\\). More generally, Dekel et al. (1998)\nshow that there is no nontrivial unawareness operator \\(U\\) satisfying\nthe following properties:\n\n\\(U(E) \\subseteq \\overline{K(E)}\\cap \\overline{K(E)}\\)\n\\(K(U(E))=\\emptyset\\)\n\\(U(E)\\subseteq U(U(E))\\)\n\nThere is an extensive literature devoted to developing models that\ncan represent the players\u2019 unawareness.
