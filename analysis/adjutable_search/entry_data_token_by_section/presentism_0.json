    "main_text": "What is Presentism?\n1. What is Presentism?\n\nAs a bare ontological thesis, presentism can be understood as\nP:\n\n(P)Only\npresent things exist.\n\n\nP is a claim about what exists (what there is), absolutely and\nunrestrictedly. As a description of presentism, it\u2019s both\nmainstream and minimal. That is, many would accept P,\nor its logical equivalents, as a statement of presentism (e.g.,\nHinchliff 1996: 123; Crisp 2004: 15; Hawley 2014: 48; Emery 2019:\n963), but they would acknowledge that more needs to be said to\narticulate a complete theory. To flesh out the ontological thesis,\nP is often contrasted with two other ontological\ntheses: an opposing view of time, eternalism (\u201cpast,\npresent, and future things exist\u201d), and an analogical view in\nmodality, actualism (\u201conly actual things exist\u201d)\n(see, e.g., Adams 1986: 321; Hinchliff 1996: 123\u20134; Sider 1999:\n326, 2001: 11\u201312; Noonan 2013: 219\u201320, 2019: 490\u20133).\nTheodore Sider, for instance, neatly articulates this apparent\nmainstream characterisation:\n\n\nPresentism is the doctrine that only the present is real. \u2026 A\npresentist thinks that everything is present; more generally, that,\nnecessarily, it is always true that everything is (then) present.\n\nPresentism is the temporal analogue of the modal doctrine of\nactualism, according to which everything is actual. The\nopposite view in the philosophy of modality is possibilism,\naccording to which nonactual things exist; its temporal analogue is\neternalism, according to which there are such things as\nmerely past and merely future entities. (1999: 325\u20136)\n\nPresentists and eternalists make competing claims about temporal\nontology. According to presentism, only present things exist.\nAccording to eternalism, past and future things, such as dinosaurs and\nhuman outposts on Mars, exist as well. These are theories about what\nthere is, just like actualism, possibilism, Platonism, nominalism,\nMeinongianism, idealism, materialism, theism, atheism\u2026 (2006:\n75)\n\n\nPresentists and the rest thus disagree about what exists. When\nconfronted with W.V. Quine\u2019s (1948) three Anglo-Saxon\nmonosyllables\u2014\u201cWhat is there?\u201d\u2014presentists\nhave a simple and distinctive reply: \u201cOnly what\u2019s\npresent\u201d. Non-presentists demur. Eternalists say that there are\npast and future things too. Growing block theorists\n(\u201cno-futurists\u201d) say that there are past and present\nthings, but no future things. On the standard, mainstream picture,\nwhat\u2019s distinctive about presentism is determined primarily by\nthe distinct claims made about temporal ontology. For a brief, general\noverview of this terrain, see the entry on\n time\n (\u00a76).\n\nThe ontological thesis, P, requires supplementation.\nConsider, for example, a possible world, w, at which the\ngrowing block theory of time is true. At the first moment of\nw, P is true. There exists only the first\nmoment and that moment is present; there are no other moments, and so\nthe past hasn\u2019t yet come to exist. Later on, it will become\nclear that w isn\u2019t a presentist world, even though it\nseems initially to satisfy P: at the first moment,\nonly present things exist. For this reason, when being more\nforthcoming with a definition of their view, moving beyond mere\nslogan, presentism might more perspicuously be rendered as a view that\nis always true, if true at all (Crisp 2003: 215; 2004: 19,\nfn.6; Deasy 2017: 380). So, presentism amounts to the claim that:\n\n(PA)\nAlways, only present things exist.\n\n\nFurthermore, along the modal dimension, presentism might be thought of\nas a view that is necessarily true, if true at all (Hestevold\n& Carter 2002: 499; Markosian 2004: 47, fn.1; Ingram 2016: 2868).\nThus:\n\n(PAN)Necessarily,\nit\u2019s always the case that, only present\nthings exist.\n\n\nHowever, although presentists sometimes make this move, there\u2019s\nvery little discussion in the literature as to whether\nPAN is preferable to PA (cf. Crisp\n2003: 215) and, if so, what would justify that preference. (One might\nthink that metaphysical theses are necessarily true, if true at all.\nBut this thought is not directly connected to the debate about time\nand change, and it is certainly not uncontroversial, so we set it\naside here.) In what follows, reflecting the lack of discussion, we\nremain neutral on whether PA or PAN\nis preferred. We follow the wider literature in typically stating\npresentism as P, rather than PA,\nthough we take it that something at least as strong as\nPA is intended.\n\nMore modifications may be required. First, strictly speaking, on this\ncharacterization, presentism is a thesis that denies the existence of\natemporal or timeless entities, that is, entities\nthat aren\u2019t present (but aren\u2019t past or future either,\nbecause they are not in time). This appears to rule out the existence\nof abstract entities, on the presumption that abstracta are timeless.\n[See the entry on\n  abstract objects .]\n This also appears to rule out the existence of a timeless god, which\nis problematic for those that accept \u201cdivine timelessness\u201d\nor \u201cdivine atemporality\u201d. [See the entry on\n  eternity in Christian thought,\n esp. \u00a74.1.] One or both of these may be a step too far for some\npresentists. Hence, we might be pressed to modify P\nand restrict it to concrete or physical objects. We\u2019re not\nforced to make that move, however, since P only rules\nout such entities insofar as they are understood as timeless.\nPresentism is compatible with the existence of abstracta, for\ninstance, so long as such entities exist now (exist within time). In\nany case, timeless abstracta are inconsistent with\nP, but (as is clear) this needn\u2019t be of too\nmuch concern. It is unclear how much would be lost from the core of\npresentism if we coupled P to timeless abstracta or a\ntimeless god. For some discussion of additional problems with\ncombining presentism with divine atemporality, see Leftow (2018).\n\nSecond, presentism isn\u2019t merely the thesis that only present\nthings exist. This isn\u2019t the full extent of the position.\nWithout qualification, P is consistent with the view\nthat reality is static (or \u201cfrozen\u201d) and that time\ndoesn\u2019t really pass. But reality isn\u2019t that way; our\nreality is dynamic. Hence, a full and proper account of presentism\nrequires more detail. Typically, presentism is thought to include the\nadditional claim that various things have existed and that others will\nexist: Sennacherib\u2019s gardens at Nineveh, Boudica, and Marie\nCurie all existed, but exist no longer; and, though we exist,\nalongside the Taj Mahal, Taylor Swift, and you (dear reader), all of\nus will cease to exist at some future time(s), to be replaced by other\nthings, each of which will go out of existence in their turn. Thus,\npresentism commits us to there being a change in what exists over\ntime, a change in what\u2019s present. Frequently (although not\nexclusively), presentists describe this change in terms of temporal\npassage\u2014the passing of time\u2014or, at least, as closely\nrelated to it. So, presentism can be understood as the following\nconjunction:\n\n(PC)\n(i) Only present things exist,\n\n&\n\n(ii) What\u2019s present changes.\n\n\nFor those who state presentism explicitly in this way, see Price\n(2011: 277), Miller (2013: 346), and Leininger (2015: 726), amongst\nothers.\n\nFurther, since presentism marks a difference between the present, on\none hand, and the past and future, on the other, it\u2019s typical\n(although, again, not universal) to see presentism described as a\nversion of the \u201cA theory\u201d of time (e.g., Craig 2000;\nZimmerman 2008; Deasy 2017). Here we understand the \u201cA\ntheory\u201d as something like the union of the following two theses:\nthere are genuine, fundamental or \u201cirreducible\u201d properties\nof at least some of past, present and future (i.e., so-called \u201cA\nqualities\u201d or \u201cA properties\u201d); and, time passes (see\nthe entry on\n  time:\n \u00a75). For recent explorations of presentism without the A theory\n(or, without A qualities), see Rasmussen (2012, 2015) and Correia\n& Rosenkranz (2015).\n\nThus far, our focus has been on saying what presentism is. And, as we\nsee it, we\u2019ve reported faithfully what\u2019s said typically\nabout the view in the contemporary literature. But the recent history\nof presentism, the view as it appears in the earlier parts of the\n20th century, is a little less clear. As far as we know,\nRobert Adams is the first to use the name \u201cpresentism\u201d in\nprint (in 1986), though he implies that he isn\u2019t the first to\nname it\u2014he writes:\n\n\n[a] reduction is offered by a view that is sometimes called\n\u201cpresentism\u201d by analogy with \u201cactualism\u201d.\n(1986: 321)\n\n\nBefore 1986, matters are unclear. Many (rightly) point to Arthur Prior\nas an important and historically significant adherent of presentism.\nWe agree that Prior endorses something like the presentist\u2019s\nontological thesis, P, when he writes:\n\n\nthe present simply is the real considered in relation to two\nspecies of unreality, namely the past and the future. (1970: 245)\n\n\nBut we think that it\u2019s less obvious that Prior\u2019s complete\nview on time is presentism, as above (see e.g., Fine 1977;\nButterfield 1983; Le Poidevin 1991: 36\u201340; Jakobsen 2011). [For\ndetail on Prior\u2019s life and work, see the entry on\n  Arthur Prior .]\n There are others after Prior, but before Adams (1986) or Hinchliff\n(1988), who also appear to endorse P, such\nas Routley (1980). Similarly, we take no stand here on whether such\nphilosophers are presentists or on what we should say about\nthese definitional debates (cf. Tallant & Ingram 2021).\n\nThis concludes our opening sketch. Presentism is the view that only\npresent things exist and what\u2019s present changes (i.e., things\nchange, time passes); and, it\u2019s a version of the A theory of\ntime. Now, why believe it?\n",
