    "main_text": "\n\nHugh Everett III proposed solving the quantum measurement problem by\nadopting pure wave mechanics, the theory one gets by dropping the\ncollapse dynamics from the standard von Neumann formulation of quantum\nmechanics. Everett\u2019s relative state formulation consists in pure\nwave mechanics supplemented with a distinction between absolute and\nrelative states, a model of situated observation, and a standard of\ntypicality. His aim was to recapture the predictions of the standard\ncollapse theory by showing that the relative records of a typical\nsituated observer will satisfy the standard quantum statistics. We\nwill consider his theory and several quite different ways of\nunderstanding it.\n",
