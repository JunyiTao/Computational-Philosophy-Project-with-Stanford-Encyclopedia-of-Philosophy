    "main_text": "\n\nThe terms \u201creproducibility crisis\u201d and \u201creplication\ncrisis\u201d gained currency in conversation and in print over the\nlast decade (e.g., Pashler & Wagenmakers 2012), as disappointing\nresults emerged from large scale reproducibility projects in various\nmedical, life and behavioural sciences (e.g., Open Science\nCollaboration, OSC 2015). In 2016, a poll conducted by the journal\nNature reported that more than half (52%) of scientists\nsurveyed believed science was facing a \u201creplication\ncrisis\u201d (Baker 2016). More recently, some authors have moved to\nmore positive terms for describing this episode in science; for\nexample, Vazire (2018) refers instead to a \u201ccredibility\nrevolution\u201d highlighting the improved methods and open science\npractices it has motivated.\n\nThe crisis often refers collectively to at least the following things:\n\n\n the virtual absence of replication studies in the published\nliterature in many scientific fields (e.g., Makel, Plucker, &\nHegarty 2012), \nwidespread failure to reproduce results of published studies in\nlarge systematic replication projects (e.g., OSC 2015; Begley &\nEllis 2012), \nevidence of publication bias (Fanelli 2010a), \na high prevalence of \u201cquestionable research\npractices\u201d, which inflate the rate of false positives in the\nliterature (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn 2011; John, Loewenstein,\n& Prelec 2012; Agnoli et al. 2017; Fraser et al. 2018), and \nthe documented lack of transparency and completeness in the\nreporting of methods, data and analysis in scientific publication\n(Bakker & Wicherts 2011; Nuijten et al. 2016). \n\n\nThe associated open science reform movement aims to rectify conditions\nthat led to the crisis. This is done by promoting activities such as\ndata sharing and public pre-registration of studies, and by advocating\nstricter editorial policies around statistical reporting including\npublishing replication studies and statistically non-significant\nresults.\n\nThis review consists of four distinct parts. First, we look at the\nterm \u201creproducibility\u201d and related terms like\n\u201crepeatability\u201d and \u201creplication\u201d, presenting\nsome definitions and conceptual discussion about the epistemic\nfunction of different types of replication studies. Second, we\ndescribe the meta-science research that has established and\ncharacterised the reproducibility crisis, including large scale\nreplication projects and surveys of questionable research practices in\nvarious scientific communities. Third, we look at attempts to address\nepistemological questions about the limitations of replication, and\nwhat value it holds for scientific inquiry and the accumulation of\nknowledge. The fourth and final part describes some of the many\ninitiatives the open science reform movement has proposed (and in many\ncases implemented) to improve reproducibility in science. In addition,\nwe reflect there on the values and norms which those reforms embody,\nnoting their relevance to the debate about the role of values in the\nphilosophy of science.\n",
