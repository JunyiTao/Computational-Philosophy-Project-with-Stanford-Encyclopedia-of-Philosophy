    "main_text": "Japanese Pure Land Buddhist Thought || The Problematic of H\u014dnen\u2019s Nembutsu Teaching\n3.2 The Problematic of H\u014dnen\u2019s Nembutsu Teaching\n\nAs we have seen, H\u014dnen asserted that the nembutsu as imparted to\nbeings in Amida\u2019s vow differs profoundly from all other\npractices handed down in Buddhist tradition. Persons might, therefore,\nperform the utterance of the Buddha\u2019s name as another means of\nhealing the mind and gaining merit, in continuous recitation or as an\nelement of ritual worship or contemplative practice, or they might say\nthe name as the act prescribed in Amida\u2019s vow, entrusting\nthemselves wholly to the working of the Buddha\u2019s compassion and\nabandoning any notion of their own goodness or effort as contributing\nto realization. The former manifests self-power, the latter Other\nPower. H\u014dnen taught that it is only the latter that remains\noperative now for us. However, a serious difficulty in understanding\nthis teaching arose among H\u014dnen\u2019s following, one H\u014dnen\nstruggled to deal with but was unable to resolve doctrinally.\n\nDisciples found that the nembutsu of Amida\u2019s vow as proclaimed\nby H\u014dnen in fact involves two elements, both of which are\nessential: on the one hand, the actual saying of Amida\u2019s Name,\n\u201cNamu-amida-butsu,\u201d and on the other, the wholehearted\nentrusting of oneself to Amida\u2019s vow, which, as we have seen, is\nprecisely what qualitatively distinguishes vocal nembutsu from all\nother methods of practice and makes one\u2019s performance of it the\npractice selected for beings and already fulfilled by Amida. For\nH\u014dnen, these two elements of practice and faith\u2014utterance\nof the nembutsu and the entrusting of oneself to Amida\u2019s\nvow\u2014were mutually and unproblematically interfused, but many who\nsought to follow his teaching found that in actual engagement, the\npath appeared to be defined by emphasis on one element or the other.\nThe question became for many followers: which is central in the life\nlived in genuine accord with Amida\u2019s vow, practice or faith? In\nother words, concretely, how should persons of the nembutsu carry on\ntheir lives?\n\nThose who emphasized practice tended to assume that since the nembutsu\nwas devised and provided out of Amida\u2019s wisdom-compassion, those\nwho entrust themselves to the Buddha\u2019s vow will spontaneously,\nout of joy and gratitude, seek to live in mindfulness of Amida and to\nrecite the name as often as possible throughout the remainder of their\nlives. This view, however, sometimes shaded into ethical and\neschatological concerns. Some assumed that practitioners of the\nnembutsu should seek to live lives appropriate for birth into\nAmida\u2019s buddha-field, lives of diligent recitation and moral\nrectitude; those who failed to display such dedication were viewed as\nnegligent in their practice. Further, many adopted older views rooted\nin the Contemplation Sutra, in which nembutsu recitation was\nseen pragmatically, as a means of canceling the karmic effects of\none\u2019s past evil. This latter belief gave decisive weight to the\nnembutsu uttered at the moment of death, when the nullification of\none\u2019s final defilements of karmic evil made birth in the Pure\nLand possible.\n\nBy contrast, those who emphasized trust tended toward a more relaxed\nview of nembutsu recitation and other forms of religious observance or\nmoral rigor, insisting instead on a total trust in Amida\u2019s\ncompassion. The Pure Land sutras speak of ten or even a single\nutterance as adequate, and H\u014dnen affirms this teaching, since the\nname as prepared for beings by Amida holds the resultant virtues of\nhis inconceivably long and perfect practice. When one takes refuge in\nthe vow and utters the nembutsu, one\u2019s salvation is promised by\nAmida and one should have no misgivings. At an extreme, however,\ninsistence on leaving all to Amida\u2019s salvific activity led to\nforms of antinomianism, in which even moral restraint was viewed as\nthe impulse to deny the fact of one\u2019s cravings and affirm\none\u2019s own goodness. In more benign forms, emphasis on trust led\nto a denigration of continued utterance as evidence of doubt of the\nvow\u2019s power and as a residue of attachment to one\u2019s own\naction in bringing about attainment.\n\nH\u014dnen sought to maintain a tenuous balance between these two,\nmutually disparaging positions of emphasis on praxis and emphasis on\nfaith:\n\n\nIf, because it is taught [in the Larger Sutra] that birth is\nattained with but one or ten utterances, you say the nembutsu\nheedlessly, then faith is hindering practice. If, because it is taught\n[in Shandao\u2019s commentaries] that you should say the Name\n\u201cwithout abandoning it from moment to moment,\u201d you believe\none or ten utterances to be indecisive, then practice is hindering\nfaith. As your faith, accept that birth is attained with a single\nutterance; as your practice, endeavor in the nembutsu throughout life.\n(recorded in \u201cZensh\u014d-b\u014d ni shimesu on-kotoba,\u201d\nin Ky\u014dd\u014d 1987, p. 464 and in Hirota 1989, pp.\n12\u201313)\n\n\nHistorically, however, we find that while H\u014dnen was able to\ntransmit his insights through his own compelling presence, after his\ndeath, his disciples developed their individual interpretations of his\nnembutsu teaching in diverse directions, with some tending toward\nemphasis on nembutsu practice and other toward trust in the vow. The\nmaster, in short, failed to achieve a clear doctrinal resolution of\nthis issue of religious life. In other words, he was unable to give a\npersuasive account of the nexus between sentient being and Other\nPower, and appears finally to affirm anew the efficacy of human\naction, as either recitation of the name of Amida or entrusting of\noneself to Amida\u2019s vow, or as a combination of both.\n",
