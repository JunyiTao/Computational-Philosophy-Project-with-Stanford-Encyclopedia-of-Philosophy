In the Timaeus (37E6\u201338A6) Plato contrasts\nthe eternal forms with the time-bound created world, the world of\nchange and becoming. Time was created along with the heaven\n(38B5)\u2014meaning at least that time is the measure of change, and\nperhaps that it is identical with the movements of the heavenly bodies\n(a view later critiqued by Augustine (Confessions, Book XI.\nxxiii)). Plato\u2019s idea of eternity in the Timaeus seems\nto be that of a timeless duration. The Forms endure in the temporal\norder in which \u201ctime is the moving image of eternity\u201d. One\ncan trace a similar idea of timeless eternity back to Parmenides\n(though exactly what he means is the subject of scholarly\ndispute).\n\nWhile (in some places at least) Plato connects the necessary character\nof the Forms to timelessness, in Aristotle the connection is between\nnecessity and everlastingness. What is necessary is what exists at all\ntimes. What is contingent is what at some time is not. God, being\nnecessary, is everlasting. It may be said that the everlasting is not\nbounded by time (though it is unbounded in a weaker sense than Plato\nascribes to the Forms) in that what exists everlastingly cannot age\n(Physics 221b30). Philo of Alexandria is thought to be the\nfirst to ascribe timelessness to God, to the God of the Jewish\nScriptures. In Plotinus (ca. 185\u2013254) timelessness and life are\nfor the first time identified. Nous is eternal and beyond\ntime, enjoying duration without succession.\n",
