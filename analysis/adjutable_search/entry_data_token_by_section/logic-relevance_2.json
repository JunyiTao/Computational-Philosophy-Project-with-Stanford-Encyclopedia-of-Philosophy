    "main_text": "Semantics for Quantification\n3. Semantics for Quantification\n\nIn (1980), Richard Routley conjectured that a constant domain\nsemantics, in the sense that is familiar from modal logic, will\ncharacterize quantified relevant relevant logics. On this semantics, a\nuniversally quantified formula \\(\\forall xA(x)\\) is true\nat a world if and only if \\(A(x)\\) is true on every\ninterpretation of \\(x\\).\n\nUnfortunately, Kit Fine (1988a) proved that the logic RQ (the logic R\nof relevant implication together with some standard quantificational\naxioms) is incomplete over the constant domain semantics. \n\nFine (1988b) also developed a semantics over which RQ is complete and\nwhich can be modified to accommodate any of the mainstream relevance\nlogics. Fine\u2019s semantics is \u201cstratified\u201d. This means that a\nmodel is made up of a collection of miniature models, each with its\nown domain of individuals. Each of these mini-models is related to\nmodels with larger domains, and each world in a model is similarly\nrelated to worlds in these models with larger domains. A very clear\nexplanation of how Fine\u2019s semantics works is given in Shay Logan\n(2019). \n\nAnother semantics for quantified relevance logics is given by Mares\nand Robert Goldblatt (2006) and further developed in Goldblatt (2011).\nIn addition to worlds and domains, a model on this theory contains a\nset of propositions, which are designated sets of words. A formula\n\\(\\forall xA(x)\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if and\nonly if there is a proposition \\(\\pi\\) true at \\(w\\) such that \\(\\pi\\)\nentails every instance of \\(A(x)\\). This means that at\nevery world in the set \\(\\pi\\), every instance of \\(A(x)\\)\nis true. \n\nThe Mares-Goldblatt semantics is called an \u201cadmissible set\u201d\nsemantics. The propositions are the admissible sets. In some models at\nleast, not every set of worlds counts as a proposition. One rationale\nfor that comes from reflection on how humans relate circumstances\ntogether as similar. Not every set of situations are such that we\nwould see a similarity that the members of the set have to one another\nand to no other situations outside the set. It seems reasonable to\nthink of a proposition as a set of worlds that could act as a content\nfor some person. (Perhaps if we were to construct a language to talk\nabout what people could think in other words, we could index sets of\npropositions to worlds. But that is a topic to be left for some other\ntime.) \n\nOne useful addition to the relevant theory of quantification is a\nconditional that is used to represent restricted quantification. This\nis developed by Jc Beall, et al. (2006). Consider the categorial\nscheme, \u201cAll \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s\u201d. This scheme is\ntranslated into the language of classical logic as\n\\(\\forall x(A(x)\\supset B(x))\\).\nThe material conditional, \\(\\supset\\), is too weak to do this job in\nrelevant logic (where \\(A\\supset B\\) is understood as\n\\(\\neg A\\vee B)\\). If we were to use material implication\nis this manner, in a model for relevant logic, we could have a world\nin which all \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s, and some \\(i\\) is\n\\(A\\), but where \\(i\\) is not \\(B\\). The material\nconditional is too weak, but relevant implication is too strong. When\none says, for example, \u201cEveryone in this room owns a dog\u201d,\nshe does not mean that it follows from being in this room that people\nown a dog. Rather, it just happens that every person in this room owns\na dog. It is this connection, that lies somewhere between material and\nrelevant implication that the restricted quantificational conditional\nis supposed to capture. \n\nIt is unclear, however, that the conditional of Beall, et al. (2006)\nis the right connective to use, at least with regard to some weaker\nrelevance logics. One virtue of some weaker systems is that they can\nbe used to formalise naive set theory (see\n section 6).\n Zach Weber (2010) has formalised naive set theory, using this\nconditional to define the subset relation. The resulting system,\nunfortunately, is trivial in that every formula is provable in it.\n",
