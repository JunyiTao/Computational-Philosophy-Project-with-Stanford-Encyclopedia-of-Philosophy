This focus in part explains why many\nChristian Franciscans thought the Fons Vitae to have been\nauthored not only by a Christian but by what they would have seen as a\nright-minded Augustinian Christian. While we have known since the\n19th century that the Fons Vitae was in fact\nauthored by a Jewish poet, this has arguably not altered much of the\nAugustinian-lensed scholarship on the Fons Vitae. Some\nscholars, for example, have concluded simply on the basis of the idea\nof a Divine Will in Ibn Gabirol that he (like Augustine) must mean by\nthis some divine power at odds with emanation. While the details of Ibn\nGabirol's cosmogony are complex, and while it is indeed possible\nthat his notion of Will rules out emanation, another equally strong\noption is that he uses the term \u201cDivine Will\u201d in a way that\n(contra Augustine) is deeply compatible with Plotinian emanation. My\npoint here is simply to caution the reader: just because something\nsounds Augustinian does not mean that it is, and if it is not, we need\nto keep all our conceptual options open. Certainly \u201cwill\u201d\nis consistent with emanation in the pages of Plotinus; we should not\nstart out\u2014tacitly wearing Augustinian lenses\u2014with any\nassumptions to the contrary in the Fons\n Vitae.[16]\n(In this regard, Pessin 2009, p. 286 with note 54, \nuses the term \u201cDivine Desire\u201d to replace the\nLatin \u201cvoluntas\u201d and the English\n\u201cWill\u201d as a translation of Ibn Gabirol's Arabic\n\u201cal-ir\u00e2da\u201d).\n\n\nFor our current purposes, we must at least bear in mind that since\nIbn Gabirol is not a Christian Augustinian, it is methodologically\nstrained to read Ibn Gabirol from an Augustinian vantage point. An\nAugustinian lens does not open us to understanding the metaphysical\npicture that Ibn Gabirol is trying to paint for us.\n",
