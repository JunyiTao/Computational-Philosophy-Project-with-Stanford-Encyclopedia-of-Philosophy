(1987,\nchapter VI.7). The authors consider an exact reduction relation as a\ncertain relation between potential models of the respective theories.\nMore interesting for physical real-life examples is the approximate\nversion which is obtained as a \u201cblurred exact reduction\u201d\nby means of a subclass of an empirical uniformity on the classes of\npotential models. The Kepler-Newton case is discussed as an example of\napproximate reduction. The discussion of incommensurability suffers\nfrom the notorious difficulties of explicating such notions as\n\u201cmeaning preserving translation\u201d. There is an interesting\napplication of the interpolation theorem of meta-mathematics which\nyields the result that, roughly speaking, (exact) reduction implies\ntranslation. However, the relevance of this result is questioned in\nBalzer et al. (1987, 312 ff). Thus the discussion eventually\nends up as inconclusive, but the authors admit the possibility of a\nspectrum of incommensurabilities of different degrees in cases of\npairs of reduced/reducing theories.\n",
