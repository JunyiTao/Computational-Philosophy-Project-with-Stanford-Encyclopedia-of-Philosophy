During the first phase (1928\u20139),\ndocumented in his 1929 article \u201cSome Remarks on Logical\nForm\u201d (Klagge and Nordmann, 1993, 29\u201335), Wittgenstein\nexhibits a growing dissatisfaction with certain central details of the\nTractatus\u2019s logical atomism, and notably with the\nthesis of the independence of elementary propositions. During this\nphase, however, he is still working within the broad conception of\nanalysis presupposed, if not fully developed, in the\nTractatus. The second phase (1931\u20132) involves a\nrevolutionary break with that very conception.\n",
