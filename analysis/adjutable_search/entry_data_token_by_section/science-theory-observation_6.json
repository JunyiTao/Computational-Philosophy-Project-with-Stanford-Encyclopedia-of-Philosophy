    "main_text": "Theory and value ladenness || Assuming the theory to be tested\n3.2 Assuming the theory to be tested\n\nThomas Kuhn (1962), Norwood Hanson (1958), Paul Feyerabend (1959) and\nothers cast suspicion on the objectivity of observational evidence in\nanother way by arguing that one cannot use empirical evidence to test\na theory without committing oneself to that very theory. This would be\na problem if it leads to dogmatism but assuming the theory to be\ntested is often benign and even necessary.\n\nFor instance, Laymon (1988) demonstrates the manner in which the very\ntheory that the Michelson-Morley experiments are considered to test is\nassumed in the experimental design, but that this does not engender\ndeleterious epistemic effects (250). The Michelson-Morley apparatus\nconsists of two interferometer arms at right angles to one another,\nwhich are rotated in the course of the experiment so that, on the\noriginal construal, the path length traversed by light in the\napparatus would vary according to alignment with or against the\nEarth\u2019s velocity (carrying the apparatus) with respect to the\nstationary aether. This difference in path length would show up as\ndisplacement in the interference fringes of light in the\ninterferometer. Although Michelson\u2019s intention had been to\nmeasure the velocity of the Earth with respect to the all-pervading\naether, the experiments eventually came to be regarded as furnishing\ntests of the Fresnel aether theory itself. In particular, the null\nresults of these experiments were taken as evidence against the\nexistence of the aether. Naively, one might suppose that whatever\nassumptions were made in the calculation of the results of these\nexperiments, it should not be the case that the theory under the gun\nwas assumed nor that its negation was.\n\nBefore Michelson\u2019s experiments, the Fresnel aether theory did\nnot predict any sort of length contraction. Although Michelson assumed\nno contraction in the arms of the interferometer, Laymon argues that\nhe could have assumed contraction, with no practical impact on the\nresults of the experiments. The predicted fringe shift is calculated\nfrom the anticipated difference in the distance traveled by light in\nthe two arms is the same, when higher order terms are neglected. Thus,\nin practice, the experimenters could assume either that the\ncontraction thesis was true or that it was false when determining the\nlength of the arms. Either way, the results of the experiment would be\nthe same. After Michelson\u2019s experiments returned no evidence of\nthe anticipated aether effects, Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction was\npostulated precisely to cancel out the expected (but not found)\neffects and save the aether theory. Morley and Miller then set out\nspecifically to test the contraction thesis, and still assumed no\ncontraction in determining the length of the arms of their\ninterferometer (ibid., 253). Thus Laymon argues that the\nMichelson-Morley experiments speak against the tempting assumption\nthat \u201cappraisal of a theory is based on phenomena which can be\ndetected and measured without using assumptions drawn from the theory\nunder examination or from competitors to that theory\u201d\n(ibid., 246).\n\nEpistemological hand-wringing about the use of the very theory to be\ntested in the generation of the evidence to be used for testing, seems\nto spring primarily from a concern about vicious circularity. How can\nwe have a genuine trial, if the theory in question has been presumed\ninnocent from the outset? While it is true that there would be a\nserious epistemic problem in a case where the use of the theory to be\ntested conspired to guarantee that the evidence would turn\nout to be confirmatory, this is not always the case when theories are\ninvoked in their own testing. Woodward (2011) summarizes a tidy\ncase:\n\nFor example, in Millikan\u2019s oil drop experiment, the mere fact\nthat theoretical assumptions (e.g., that the charge of the electron is\nquantized and that all electrons have the same charge) play a role in\nmotivating his measurements or a vocabulary for describing his results\ndoes not by itself show that his design and data analysis were of such\na character as to guarantee that he would obtain results supporting\nhis theoretical assumptions. His experiment was such that he might\nwell have obtained results showing that the charge of the electron was\nnot quantized or that there was no single stable value for this\nquantity. (178)\n\n\nFor any given case, determining whether the theoretical assumptions\nbeing made are benign or straight-jacketing the results that it will\nbe possible to obtain will require investigating the particular\nrelationships between the assumptions and results in that case. When\ndata production and analysis processes are complicated, this task can\nget difficult. But the point is that merely noting the involvement of\nthe theory to be tested in the generation of empirical results does\nnot by itself imply that those results cannot be objectively useful\nfor deciding whether the theory to be tested should be accepted or\nrejected.\n",
