    "main_text": "Justice in Holdings\n4. Justice in Holdings\n\nWhile the core official purpose of Part I of ASU is the\ndefense of the minimal state against the anarchist critique, the core\nofficial purpose of Part II of ASU, is to argue that\n\u201cno more extensive state can be justified\u201d (xi). In\nchapter 8 of Part II, \u201cEquality, Envy, Exploitation,\nEtc.\u201d, Nozick seeks to counter the force of a series of\nconsiderations that are invoked on behalf of a more extensive state.\nThese include equality, equal opportunity, meaningful work,\nworkers\u2019 control, and exploitation. In chapter 9 of part II,\n\u201cDemoktesis\u201d, he constructs an invisible hand account of\nthe rise of an unconstrained democratic state. The intention seems to\nbe to undercut the appeal of such a state by showing what sorts of\nunattractive, albeit permissible, actions individuals would have to\nengage in to arrive at such a state. Nozick needs, then, to explain\nwhy a hypothetical invisible hand explanation of the minimal state\nmuch more legitimates it than a hypothetical invisible hand\nexplanation of the unconstrained democratic state legitimates it\n(292\u2013294).\n\nStill, by far the most philosophically important chapter of Part II is\nchapter 7, \u201cDistributive Justice\u201d in which Nozick seeks to\ncounter the view that a more extensive state is justified as an\ninstrument of distributive justice. This chapter has been the subject\nof the bulk of the philosophical commentary on ASU. In this\nchapter, Nozick sketches his \u201chistorical entitlement\u201d\nconception of justice in holdings, provides a number of quite general\narguments against all alternative conceptions of justice in holdings,\nendorses a Lockean Proviso that adds a bit of complexity to the\nentitlement doctrine, and provides a powerful critique of Rawls\u2019\ncase in A Theory of Justice for his strongly redistributive\n\u201cdifference principle\u201d. This section focuses on the first\nthree of these topics.\n",
