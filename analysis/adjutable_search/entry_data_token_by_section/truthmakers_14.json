    "main_text": "What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers? || Deflationism\n3.4 Deflationism\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that so far from presupposing the\nnotion of truth, the various truth-making principles we have\ndiscussed operate at a far more subterranean level. Bigelow writes,\n\u201cThe force behind Truth-maker lies deeper than worries about the\nnature of truth and of truth-bearers\u201d (Bigelow 1988: 127, 2009:\n396\u20137; Robinson 2000: 152; Lewis 2001: 605\u20136; Horwich\n2009: 188\u20139, Bricker 2015: 169). Suppose we understand what it\nis to be truth-maker in terms of entailment. Then whatever the range\nof truths we think are capable of being rendered true, the\n\u201cguts\u201d of our truth-maker principle can be stated using\nthe schema,\n\n(Schema) \nIf P, then there must be something in the world whose\nexistence entails that P.\n\n\nThis schema is equivalent to the infinitely many conditionals that\nfall under it:\n\n(i1)\n If the donkey is brown, then there must be something in the world\nwhose existence entails that the donkey is brown;\n(i2)\n if the Parthenon is on the Acropolis then there must be something\nin the world whose existence entails that the Parthenon is on the\nAcropolis; and so on.\n\n\nNote that neither \u201ctrue\u201d nor \u201ctruth\u201d shows up\nanywhere in the schema or its instances. Arguably the only role that\nthe notion of truth performs is the one that\nminimalist or deflationary theories of truth emphasize, that of\nenabling us to capture all of that unending string of conditionals in\na single slogan,\n\n(Slogan) \nFor any truth, there must be something in the world whose\nexistence entails that truth.\n\n\nBut since truth is serving here only as a device of\ngeneralization, the real subject matter of (Slogan) is\nalready expressed by the conditionals (i1), (i2)\netc. Since they make no explicit mention of either\npropositions or truth, a theory of truth-makers is neither a theory\nabout propositions nor a theory about truth. If so, then the theory of\ntruth-makers can neither gain inspiration from, nor be tarred by the\nsame brush as the correspondence theory of truth. Nor need the theory\nof truth-makers be bedeviled by concerns about the nature of truth\nbearers.\n\nOne may nevertheless wonder whether Bigelow and Lewis have thrown the\nbaby out with the bathwater. MacBride (2013a) argues that if we do not\nallow ourselves the general thought that truth-bearers are true or\nfalse depending upon how things stand in the world then it is unclear\nwhat, if any, credibility (i1), (i2) etc. have. For\nwhy should there be something in the world whose existence\nnecessitates that (e.g.) cats purr? Why can\u2019t cats purr, even though\nthere is nothing whose existence entails that truth? Since\nSlogan is intended to be just shorthand for its instances,\n(i 1), (i 2) etc. it follows Slogan can\u2019t\nbe any more credible or motivated than its instances. If, however, we\nallow ourselves a conception of truth which isn\u2019t deflationary, i.e.\na substantial conception whereby truth is conceived as a relation\nborne by a truth-bearer to something worldly that exists independently\nof us, then, MacBride argues, we will have an independent reason for\npositing something worldly the existence of which necessitates the\ntruth that cats purr etc. (see also Armstrong 1997: 128).
