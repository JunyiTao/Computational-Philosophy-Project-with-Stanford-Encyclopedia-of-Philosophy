    "main_text": "Correspondence Between the Formalism and Our Experience || The Measure of Existence\n3.6 The Measure of Existence\n\nThere are many worlds existing in parallel in the Universe. Although\nall worlds are of the same physical size (this might not be true if we\ntake into account the quantum aspects of early cosmology), and in\nevery world sentient beings feel as \u201creal\u201d as in any other\nworld, there is a sense in which some worlds are larger than others.\nVaidman 1998 describes this property as the measure of\nexistence of a world.\n\nThere are two aspects of the measure of existence of a world. First,\nit quantifies the ability of the world to interfere with other worlds\nin a gedanken experiment, as expounded at the end of this section.\nSecond, the measure of existence is the basis for introducing an\nillusion of probability in the MWI as described in the next\nchapter. The measure of existence is the parallel of the probability\nmeasure discussed in Everett 1957 and pictorially described in\nLockwood 1989 (p. 230).\n\nGiven the decomposition (2), the measure of existence of the world\n\\(i\\) is \\(\\mu_i = \\lvert \\alpha_i\\rvert^2.\\) It can also be expressed\nas the expectation value of \\(\\mathbf{P}_i\\), the projection operator\non the space of quantum states corresponding to the actual values of\nall physical variables describing the world \\(i\\): \n\n\\[\\tag{3} \\mu_i = \\langle \\Psi_\\universe \\mid \\mathbf{P}_i \\mid\n\\Psi_\\universe \\rangle. \\]\n\n\nNote, that although the measure of existence of a world is expressed\nusing the quantum state of the Universe (2), the concept of measure of\nexistence, as the concept of a world belongs to part (ii) of the MWI,\nthe bridge to our experience.\n\n\u201cI\u201d also have a measure of existence. It is the sum of the\nmeasures of existence of all different worlds in which I exist. Note\nthat I do not directly experience the measure of my existence. I feel\nthe same weight, see the same brightness, etc. irrespectively of how\ntiny my measure of existence might be.\n\nMy current measure of existence is relevant only for gedanken\nsituations like Wigner\u2019s friend Wigner 1961 (recently revived by\nFrauchiger and Renner 2018) which demonstrates the meaning of the measure\nof existence of a world as a measure of its ability to interfere with\nother worlds. If I am a friend of Wigner, a gedanken superpower who\ncan perform interference experiments with macroscopic objects like\npeople, and I perform an experiment with two outcomes A and B such\nthat two worlds will be created with different measures of existence,\nsay \\(2\\mu_{A}= \\mu_{B}\\), then there is a difference between Lev A\nand Lev B in how Wigner can affect their future through the\ninterference of worlds. Both Lev A and Lev B consider performing a new\nexperiment with the same device. Wigner can interfere the worlds in\nsuch a way that Lev A (the one with a smaller measure of existence) will\nnot have the future with result A of the second experiment. However,\nWigner cannot prevent the future result A from Lev B, see Vaidman 1998\n(p. 256).\n",
