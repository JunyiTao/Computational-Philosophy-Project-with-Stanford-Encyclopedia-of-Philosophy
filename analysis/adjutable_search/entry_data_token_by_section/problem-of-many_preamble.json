    "main_text": "\n\nAs anyone who has flown out of a cloud knows, the boundaries of a\ncloud are a lot less sharp up close than they can appear on the\nground. Even when it seems clearly true that there is one, sharply\nbounded, cloud up there, really there are thousands of water droplets\nthat are neither determinately part of the cloud, nor determinately\noutside it. Consider any object that consists of the core of the\ncloud, plus an arbitrary selection of these droplets. It will look\nlike a cloud, and circumstances permitting rain like a cloud, and\ngenerally has as good a claim to be a cloud as any other object in\nthat part of the sky. But we cannot say every such object is a cloud,\nelse there would be millions of clouds where it seemed like there was\none. And what holds for clouds holds for anything whose boundaries\nlook less clear the closer you look at it. And that includes just\nabout every kind of object we normally think about, including humans.\nAlthough this seems to be a merely technical puzzle, even a\ntriviality, a surprising range of proposed solutions has emerged, many\nof them mutually inconsistent. It is not even settled whether a\nsolution should come from metaphysics, or from philosophy of language,\nor from logic. Here we survey the options, and provide several links\nto the many topics related to the Problem.\n",
