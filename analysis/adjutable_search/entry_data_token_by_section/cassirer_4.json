    "main_text": "Cassirer, Hegel and the Cultural Sciences\n5. Cassirer, Hegel and the Cultural Sciences\n\nCassirer emphasizes the kinship between his Philosophy of Symbolic\nForms and Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit in the\nPrefaces to both the second (1925) and third (1929) volumes. Recent\ncommentators ([Skidelsky 2008] [Moss 2015]) have illuminatingly built\non this circumstance in further articulating the relationship between\nCassirer and Hegel. Considerable light is shed on this relationship by\nCassirer\u2019s treatment of the problem of the\nNaturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften in\nThe Logic of the Cultural Sciences (1942). We shall return to\nthis situation in the next section.\n\nHegel had conceived nature (Natur) and spirit\n(Geist) as two different expressions of a single divine\ninfinite Reason, which manifests itself temporally from two different\npoints of view. His project of an encyclopedia of philosophical\nsciences had three parts, the logic, the philosophy of nature, and the\nphilosophy of spirit, where the logic had the task of depicting the\ndialectical conceptual structure of infinite divine Reason itself. But\nthis Hegelian project for securing the ultimate logico-metaphysical\nidentity of nature and spirit found ever fewer followers as the\ncentury progressed, as the rising tide of neo-Kantianism \u2013 aided\nby further developments within the natural sciences instigated by\nHermann von Helmholtz \u2013 undermined the appeal of the original\nNaturphilosophie of Schelling and Hegel together with their\nAbsolute Reason. The result was the problem of the\nNaturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften as it\npresented itself to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n[Cassirer 1942] develops a characteristically methodological\nperspective on this problem by treating both disciplines as\nempirical rather than \u201cspeculative\u201d sciences (in\nthe sense of Schelling and Hegel) and elucidating their methodological\nrelationship within the philosophy of symbolic forms.\n\n[Cassirer 1942] argues that the empirical evidential basis for the\ncultural sciences starts from the same realm of perceived physical\nobjects and processes distributed in space and time as do the natural\nsciences \u2013 in this case documents, artifacts, rituals,\nperformances \u2013 but it goes on to imbue them with a symbolic\n\u201csense\u201d or \u201cmeaning\u201d that is not at issue in\nthe natural sciences. We must distinguish, in particular, between the\nrepresentative function (Darstellungsfunktion) and the\nexpressive function (Ausdrucksfunktion) of thought, and only\na prejudice privileging \u201cthing perception\n[Dingwahrnehmen]\u201d over \u201cexpressive perception\n[Ausdruckswahrnehmen]\u201d can support the idea that the\nnatural sciences have a more secure evidential basis than he cultural\nsciences. (It is precisely this prejudice which, according to\nCassirer, lies behind Carnap\u2019s \u201cphysicalism.\u201d) For\nCassirer, by contrast, both forms of perception are equally\nlegitimate. While the natural sciences take their evidence from the\nsphere of thing perception, the cultural sciences take theirs from the\nsphere of expressive perception \u2013 and, in the first instance,\nfrom our lived experience in a human community sharing a common system\nof \u201ccultural meanings.\u201d\n\nYet we also have the capacity, in the cultural sciences, to\nextend such meanings beyond their originally local contexts. Whereas\nintersubjective validity in the natural sciences rests on universal\nlaws of nature ranging over all (physical) places and times, an\nanalogous type of intersubjective validity arises in the cultural\nsciences independently of such laws. Although every \u201ccultural\nobject\u201d has its own individual place in (historical) time and\n(geographical-cultural) space, it can still continuously approach a\nuniversal cultural meaning (in history or ethnography) as it is\ncontinually interpreted and reinterpreted from the\nperspective of other times and places. Universal cultural meaning\nthereby emerges only asymptotically, in a way similar to the genetic\nconception of knowledge of the Marburg School (now seen as based on\nthe significative function of thought). Rather than an abstract\nmathematical relation of backwards-directed inclusion, however, we are\nconcerned, in the historical cultural sciences, with a hermeneutical\nrelation of backwards-directed interpretation and reinterpretation\n\u2013 and, as a result, there is no possibility, in these sciences,\nof reliably predicting the future.\n\nWe can further illuminate Cassirer\u2019s evolving attempt to situate\nhimself between Kant and Hegel by considering his evolving\nrelationship to Heidegger. In the 1929 Disputation at Davos Cassirer\nchallenged Heidegger\u2019s radical \u201cfinitism\u201d by\nappealing to the presumed necessary and eternal validity found in both\nthe mathematical sciences and morality. And after the Disputation\nCassirer added five footnotes to Being and Time (1927) in\nThe Phenomenology of Knowledge before its publication, where\nhe suggested that his attempt to begin the Hegelian phenomenology with\nmythical thought rather than ordinary sense perception could also\naddress Heidegger\u2019s concerns. In 1931, however, Cassirer\npublished a review of [Heidegger 1929], which took a different\napproach from his remarks at Davos. Instead of primarily emphasizing\nthe \u201ceternal\u201d validity found in the mathematical sciences,\nCassirer now placed his main emphasis on the ethical and aesthetic\ndimensions of Kant\u2019s thought, as expressed in the Critique\nof Practical Reason (1788) and the Critique of the Power of\nJudgement (1790). His main point was that, whereas the\nTranscendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure\nReason(1781/1787) may indeed be written from the perspective of\nhuman finitude, the rest of Kant\u2019s system embeds this\nperspective within a wider conception of \u201cthe intelligible\nsubstrate of humanity.\u201d\n\n[Cassirer 1931] mirrors his just-completed attempt to embed the\nMarburg genetic conception of knowledge within a wider conception of\nthe development of human culture as a whole. The way in which Cassirer\nsituates his new philosophy of culture with respect to both Hegel and\nHeidegger then illuminates his fundamental divergence from Hegel\n\u2013 as it came to be expressed in Cassirer\u2019s works on\nhistory and culture after he left Germany for good in 1933. By\nbuilding the Marburg conception of knowledge, in his new philosophy of\nculture, on top of the more primitive forms of mythical thought\n[Ausdruckswahrnehmen] and ordinary language\n[Dingwahrnehmen], Cassirer takes himself to have done justice\nto the insights of both Hegel and Heidegger while avoiding both the\ninfinite divine reason of the former and the radical human finitude of\nthe latter. Yet he has now conceded to Heidegger that Kant\u2019s\ntheory of human cognition involves only the notion of potential rather\nthan actual infinity. In particular, Kant\u2019s treatment of the\nregulative use of the ideas of reason from a merely\ntheoretical point of view leaves their actual content quite\nindeterminate. In the case of the idea of transcendental freedom, for\nexample, we are only able to determine it negatively (from a\ntheoretical point of view), as a species of causality that is\nnot bound by the conditions of time-determination governing\nthe phenomenal world.\n\nIn the Critique of Practical Reason, however, Kant asserts\nthat transcendental freedom acquires a determinate content from pure\npractical reason, through our immediate awareness of the\nmoral law as normatively binding on our will (as a fact of reason),\nand that the (practical) objective reality thereby conferred on this\nidea can then be transferred to the ideas of God and Immortality. This\nis because the moral law unconditionally commands us to seek the\nHighest Good \u2013 the realization of the Kingdom of Ends here on\nearth \u2013 which is an infinite task requiring\ninfinite (practical) faith and hope. The resulting divergence\nfrom the indeterminate and merely potential infinity arising within\ntheoretical reason is visible in the famous passage on the starry\nheavens above me and the moral law within me at the end of the\nCritique of Practical Reason, from which Cassirer quotes in\nhis 1931 review of Heidegger. What the Critique of the Power of\nJudgement adds to this conception is then the further idea that\nrigorous mathematical scientific understanding of the phenomenal world\n(\u201cmechanistic\u201d understanding) runs out considerably before\nwe arrive at the history of human culture, so that the future is in\nprinciple open to the possibility of our continuously approximating\nthe Highest Good without limit. But Cassirer, as we have just seen,\nhas now achieved a parallel result though his methodological\ndistinction between the natural and the cultural sciences. He is\nthereby in a position to replace what he takes to be the oppressive\n(speculative) infinity of Hegel\u2019s Absolute Reason with the\nliberating (practical) infinity of our human (practical) reason. It is\nin this way, for Cassirer, that our cultural future always lies open\nand is always up to us.\n",
