    "main_text": "Topics in Voting Theory || Voting to Track the Truth\n4.3 Voting to Track the Truth\n\nThe voting methods discussed above have been judged on\nprocedural grounds. This \u201cproceduralist approach to\ncollective decision making\u201d is defined by Coleman and Ferejohn\n(1986, p. 7) as one that \u201cidentifies a set of ideals with which\nany collective decision-making procedure ought to comply. \u2026 [A]\nprocess of collective decision making would be more or less\njustifiable depending on the extent to which it satisfies them.\u201d\nThe authors add that a distinguishing feature of proceduralism is that\n\u201cwhat justifies a [collective] decision-making procedure is\nstrictly a necessary property of the procedure \u2014 one entailed by\nthe definition of the procedure alone.\u201d Indeed, the\ncharacterization theorems discussed in the previous section can be\nviewed as an implementation of this idea (cf. Riker 1982). The general\nview is to analyze voting methods in terms of \u201cfairness\ncriteria\u201d that ensure that a given method is sensitive to\nall of the voters\u2019 opinions in the right way. \n\nHowever, one may not be interested only in whether a collective\ndecision was arrived at \u201cin the right way,\u201d but in whether\nor not the collective decision is correct. This\nepistemic approach to voting is nicely explained by Joshua\nCohen (1986, p. 34): \n\nAn epistemic interpretation of voting has three main elements: (1) an\nindependent standard of correct decisions \u2014 that is, an account\nof justice or of the common good that is independent of current\nconsensus and the outcome of votes; (2) a cognitive account of voting\n\u2014 that is, the view that voting expresses beliefs about what the\ncorrect policies are according to the independent standard, not\npersonal preferences for policies; and (3) an account of decision\nmaking as a process of the adjustment of beliefs, adjustments that are\nundertaken in part in light of the evidence about the correct answer\nthat is provided by the beliefs of others.  \n\n\n\nUnder this interpretation of voting, a given method is judged on how\nwell it \u201ctracks the truth\u201d of some objective fact (the\ntruth of which is independent of the method being used). A\ncomprehensive comparison of these two approaches to voting touches on\na number of issues surrounding the justification of democracy (cf.\nChristiano 2008); however, I will not focus on these broader issues\nhere. Instead, I briefly discuss an analysis of Majority Rule that\ntakes this epistemic approach. \n\nThe most well-known analysis comes from the writings of Condorcet\n(1785). The following theorem, which is attributed to Condorcet and\nwas first proved formally by Laplace, shows that if there are only two\noptions, then majority rule is, in fact, the best procedure from an\nepistemic point of view. This is interesting because it also shows\nthat a proceduralist analysis and an epistemic analysis both single\nout Majority Rule as the \u201cbest\u201d voting method when there\nare only two candidates. \n\nAssume that there are \\(n\\) voters that have to decide between two\nalternatives. Exactly one of these alternatives is (objectively)\n\u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cbetter.\u201d The typical example\nhere is a jury deciding whether or not a defendant is guilty. The two\nassumptions of the Condorcet jury theorem are: \n\nIndependence: The voters\u2019 opinions are probabilistically\nindependent (so, the probability that two or more voters are correct\nis the product of the probability that each individual voter is\ncorrect). \nVoter Competence: The probability that a voter makes the\ncorrect decision is greater than 1/2 (and this probability is the same\nfor all voters, though this is not crucial). \n\n\nSee Dietrich 2008 for a critical discussion of these two assumptions.\nThe classic theorem is: \n\nCondorcet Jury Theorem.\n\nSuppose that Independence and Voter Competence are both satisfied.\nThen, as the group size increases, the probability that the majority\nchooses the correct option increases and converges to certainty.\n\n\nSee Nitzan 2010 (part III) and Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013 for modern\nexpositions of this theorem, and Goodin and Spiekermann 2018 for\nimplications for the theory of democracy. \n\nCondorcet envisioned that the above argument could be adapted to\nvoting situations with more than two alternatives. Young (1975, 1988, 1995) \nwas the first to fully work out this\nidea (cf. List and Goodin 2001 who generalize the Condorcet Jury  \nTheorem to more than two alternatives in a different framework). \nHe showed (among other things) that the Borda Count can be\nviewed as the maximum likelihood estimator for identifying\nthe best candidate. Conitzer and Sandholm (2005), Conitzer et\nal. (2009), Xia et al. (2010), and Xia (2016) take these ideas further\nby classifying different voting methods according to whether or not\nthe methods can be viewed as a maximum likelihood estimator\n(for a noise model). The most general results along these lines can be\nfound in Pivato 2013 which contains a series of results showing when\nvoting methods can be interpreted as different kinds of statistical\n\u2018estimators\u2019. \n",
