And, plausibly, token\nvariables are individuated by their values. So, when it comes to token\ninfluence between variables, we will face many of the same questions\nand debates about the causal relata: how fine- or coarse-grained are\nthey? When are two variables the same; when are they different? Can\nvariables include absences or omissions as values? There is, however,\nan additional question to be a asked about the metaphysics of\nvariables: when can some collection of variable values be\ngrouped together into a single variable? All agree that the potential\nvalues of a variable must exclude each other. That is: if\n\\(v\\) and \\(v^*\\) are two values of the variable \\(V\\), then it should\nbe impossible that \\(V=v \\wedge V=v^*\\) (here, \\(V=v\\) is the\nproposition that the variable \\(V\\) takes on the value \\(v\\), and\nlikewise \\(V=v^*\\) is the proposition that the variable \\(V\\) takes on\nthe value \\(v^*\\)).\n\nBut there are additional questions to be asked about which values may\nbe grouped together into token variables. For instance: must the\nvalues of a variable concern the same time? Or can a single variable\nhave multiple values which concern different times? Suppose Patricia\ndied on Monday from an overdose of morphine; had she not received the\nmorphine, she would have died on Tuesday. Then, there are several\ndifferent variables we might try to use when thinking about\nPatricia\u2019s death. We could use a single variable for whether\nPatricia died. This variable would take on one value if Patricia\ndied on Monday or Tuesday, and another value if she remained alive\nthroughout Monday and Tuesday. Or we could use a single variable for\nwhen Patricia died. This variable would take on one value if\nshe died on Monday, and another value if she died on Tuesday.\nAlternatively, we could use a collection of time-indexed variables,\nwhether Patricia had died by time t, for some range\nof times t. As Hitchcock (2012) puts it: the question is\nwhether Patricia\u2019s dying on Monday and Patricia\u2019s dying on\nTuesday\n\n\ncorrespond to the same value of the same variable,\nto different values of the same variable, or to\nvalues of different variables. (2012: 90)\n\n\nOf course, this question carries the presupposition that we must\nchoose between these options. You might instead think that\nall of these variables exist, and each enter into different\nrelations of influence.\n\nWhen it comes to type variables, there are additional questions about\nhow token variables are to be type-individuated, over and above\nquestions about the individuation conditions of the token variables\nthemselves. This question is not much discussed, but it is natural to\nthink that the type individuation of variables is inherited from the\ntype-individuation of their values. That is: \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are\nof the same type if and only if \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) have the same\nnumber of potential values, and each those values are of the same\ntype. For instance, the token variables how much I weigh and\nhow much Obama weighs are of the same type, as they both have\nthe same type of potential values (1 kg, 2 kg, etc); on the other\nhand, how much I weigh and how many pounds of arugula\nObama eats are not of the same type, since their potential values\nare not of the same type.\n",
