    "main_text": "What is Structural Rationality? || The Emergence of the Concept of Structural Rationality\n1.1 The Emergence of the Concept of Structural Rationality\n\nThe term \u2018structural (ir)rationality\u2019 is relatively\nrecent; to the best of our knowledge, its first use with its current\nmeaning is in Scanlon\n (2007).[2]\n However, philosophers have been theorizing about the underlying\nconcept, using different terminology, for significantly longer.\nInteresting questions can be asked about whether historical figures\nsuch as Hume and Kant had theories of structural rationality. However,\nthe contemporary debate about structural rationality can be more\ndirectly traced to a number of important articles and books from the\n1970s and 80s (Hill 1973; Greenspan 1975; Dancy 1977; Darwall 1983),\nwhich largely focus on practical rationality.\n\nDarwall\u2019s 1983 book Impartial Reason is particularly\ninstructive to focus on. The first half of the book is devoted to\narguing against what Darwall calls the \u201cDBR thesis\u201d, on\nwhich an agent\u2019s normative reasons are all dependent on her\ndesires or ends \u2013 a thesis that was highly popular at the time.\nOne line of support for the DBR thesis to which Darwall responds can\nbe reconstructed roughly as follows:\n\nIt\u2019s irrational not to intend to take the believed means to\none\u2019s ends.\nTherefore, not intending to take the believed means to one\u2019s\nends involves a failure to respond to one\u2019s reasons.\nTherefore, one\u2019s reasons are strongly dependent on\none\u2019s ends.\n\n\nThis line of argument, if successful, generates strongly subjectivist\n(and anti-moralist) results about reasons. For example, to adapt\nDarwall\u2019s memorable example, suppose Jo intends to kill Jay in\nthe most violent way possible, and believes that the most violent way\nto kill Jay is with a cleaver. But suppose Jo does not intend to kill\nJay with a cleaver. Jo is, then, practically irrational. According to\nthe line of thought above, the way to explain this is by holding that\nJo\u2019s intention to kill Jay in the most violent way possible\n\u2013 perhaps together with her belief that the most violent way to\nkill Jay is with a cleaver \u2013 gives her a strong reason\nto (intend to) kill Jay with a cleaver. Generalizing, the result is\nthat Jo can give herself strong reasons to perform highly immoral (or,\nindeed, imprudent) acts merely by adopting ends to which those acts\nare (believed) necessary means.\n\nNot so fast, says Darwall, however. He focuses on critiquing the\ntransition from (a) to (b) \u2013 though one could certainly also\nquestion the transition from (b) to (c). According to Darwall, the\nirrationality of failing to (intend to) take the (believed) means to\none\u2019s ends need not equate to a failure to respond to\none\u2019s reasons. Rather, it can be understood as a\nfailure to conform to a sui generis rational requirement of\ncoherence, which itself has no consequences for claims about reasons.\nDarwall calls such requirements principles of \u201crelative\nrationality\u201d; this notion is roughly equivalent to the more\ncontemporary notion of structural rationality. As well as treating the\nrequirement of instrumental rationality this way, Darwall makes a\nsimilar move regarding decision-theoretic principles that require us\nto do what maximizes subjective utility given our credences and\npreferences.\n\nThe basic maneuver here recurs in the works of a number of other\nphilosophers (McDowell 1995; Scanlon 1998, 2004; Broome 1999, 2001a,\n2004; Dancy 2000). In each case, the aim is to avoid highly\nsubjectivist or anti-moralist results about reasons, or instances of\nwhat is often called \u201cbootstrapping\u201d (Bratman 1987; Broome\n2001a), whereby merely having an attitude that is itself immoral or\nunreasonable can give one reasons to adopt further immoral or\nunreasonable attitudes. And in each case, these results are avoided by\ntreating the requirements of structural rationality as autonomous and\ndistinct from requirements that concern responding to reasons. By\nmaking space for a distinctively structural or coherence-based notion\nof rationality, the thought goes, we can accommodate intuitions about\nthe irrationality of incoherence without committing ourselves to\npotentially problematic subjectivist assumptions about normative\nreasons.\n\nAnalogous points can be made in doxastic cases. To adapt an example\nfrom Fogal (2020), suppose that Ali believes that he is Superman, and\nbelieves that Superman can fly. If we now add that Ali believes that\nhe cannot fly, Ali seems to be subject to a (further) charge of\nirrationality that he was not otherwise subject to. Should we conclude\nfrom this that, merely by believing that he is Superman and that\nSuperman can fly, Ali gives himself a strong reason to\nbelieve that he can fly \u2013 one that he flouts by believing,\ninstead, that he cannot fly? Many epistemologists would deny this: on\nmost views, you can\u2019t make an evidentially unsupported belief\nreasonable just by adopting other, equally unsupported, beliefs that\nentail it. Indeed, as Broome (1999) points out, if this were so, then\nany belief could make itself reasonable, since all propositions entail\nthemselves. Rather, the thought goes, we can account for Ali\u2019s\nirrationality by saying that he violates a requirement of structural\nrationality forbidding inconsistent beliefs (or, perhaps, particular\nkinds of inconsistent beliefs).\n\nOnce reasons and requirements of structural rationality are\ndistinguished in this way, a number of important questions arise. One\npressing question is whether there are any reasons to comply with the\nrequirements of structural rationality. We\u2019ll return to this\nquestion in \u00a73. Before that, there is more to be said about the\nnotion of structural rationality and requirements thereof.\n",
