    "main_text": "\n\nEvery day, we make decisions to minimize conflicts and disruptions to\nmake peace with ourselves and people around us. Every day, we take\nactions to smooth out inconsistencies and irregularities to make our\nlives look manageable and meaningful. Every day, we perform our duties\nto our families and our professional organizations to present an image\nof loyalty and responsibility. Yet, despite our best efforts, we know\nthat we must have missed a great deal of opportunities and overlooked\na lot of options because we, knowingly or unknowingly, tend to be\ndistracted by immediate interests, unexpected circumstances, and\nunanticipated events. The fact of the matter is that in the end, we do\nnot fully know the results of our decisions: Are they truly effective\nin solving problems or repairing estranged relationships? Or are they\nmerely hiding problems or delaying solutions? Or are they\ninadvertently causing further damages or sowing the seeds for bigger\nproblems to come?\n\nYet, despite worry, anxiety, and self-pity, we continue to move\nforward. Occasionally, if we think hard enough, we may even find\nblessings in disguise\u2014a missed opportunity leads us to a new\ndevelopment; a wrong turn directs us onto a fruitful path; a hurdle\npushes us to think more carefully about alternative solutions. In the\nend, we must admit that the world is far more complicated than we can\nimagine. To live, we must take a pragmatic and provisional attitude:\nwe do our best to make informed decisions, but we do not know how far\nwe can go and how much we can accomplish.\n\nThis quest to be at peace with the complicated world is central to the\nphilosophy of the Book of Changes (Yijing\n\u6613\u7d93, Zhouyi \u5468\u6613 or I\nChing, hereafter Changes). Despite its multiple authors\nand divergent layers, the Changes focuses on one question:\nGiven that we have no full knowledge of ourselves and our surroundings\ndue to the constant changes in the world, how do we conduct our life\nmeaningfully and responsibly? Seemingly alarming, this question is\nbased on an understanding of human condition that includes three\nparts: (1) our finitude due to the limits of our cognitive abilities;\n(2) our reliance on a system of signs to understand our surroundings\nand to guide our actions, and (3) our hubris to take full control of\nour lives, even to the point of planning every step in our daily\nschedule (Hon 2019).\n\nDirectly addressing these three aspects of human condition, the\nChanges aims to alleviate our self-inflicted anxiety and\nagony. It reminds us of our limited ability to know our surroundings.\nIt offers us a system of symbols to navigate the complicated world. It\nprovides us with a set of divination rituals to calm our minds.\nThrough these three measures, the Changes helps us develop an\nappreciation of ourselves\u2014not only knowing who we are, but also\nfinding out what we can and cannot do. In short, the Changes\nhelps us develop self-confidence so that we can face changes with\ndignity, humility, and resolve.\n\nAs a text, the Changes is unique in two ways. Firstly, it is\nmulti-layered. Traditional accounts claim that the first layer of the\ncore text were graphic symbols\u2014the 8 trigrams and 64 hexagrams\n(see the images of trigrams and hexagrams in\n Appendixes 1 and 2).\n Created by a mythical figure, Fu Xi \u4f0f\u7fb2, these symbols\nmimic the continuous unfolding of the universe and denote the fluidity\nand complexity of human existence. The second layer of the core text\nincluded hexagram and line statements (see the names of the 64\nhexagrams in\n Appendix 3).\n Allegedly composed by King Wen \u6587\u738b and the Duke of Zhou\n\u5468\u516c in the 11th century BCE, these written statements\ninvoked concrete historical events\u2014such as the downfall of the\nShang dynasty and the rise of the Zhou dynasty\u2014to elucidate the\nconstancy of change in human society. The third layer were seven\npieces of writings from 5th century to 2nd century BCE. Divided into\nten segments (hence, the name \u201cTen Wings\u201d,\n\u5341\u7ffc shiyi), these writings deduced philosophical\ninsights from the graphic symbols and the hexagram and line statements\n(see the list of the Ten Wings in\n Appendix 4).\n By 135 BCE, the core text and the Ten Wings were combined to form\nwhat we now call the Changes\u2014a composite text\nconsisting of symbols, divination reports, historical records,\nfolklores, and philosophical treatises (Nylan 2001: 202\u201352;\nRedmond & Hon 2014: 1\u2013157; R. Smith 2012: 1\u201347;\nShaughnessy 2022: 5\u201364).\n\nSecondly, because of its multiple layers, the nature of the\nChanges is hard to pin down. If one focuses on the 64\nhexagrams, the Changes resembles a manual of divination. Each\nhexagram is a record of fortune-telling, consisting of a hexagram name\ndescribing a specific situation (e.g., marriage, mobilizing an army,\nor cleaning a well) and six lines detailing the alternative moves in a\ngiven situation. But if one focuses on the Ten Wings, one finds\nlengthy discussions of process cosmology, the philosophy of symbolic\nforms, and moral-metaphysics. Since its canonization in 135 BCE, the\nChanges was often read by the Chinese educated elites as a\nphilosophical text. And it was this philosophical reading that made\nthe Changes a living text throughout imperial China that\nconstantly posed critical questions to its readers and commentators\n(R. Smith 2008: 57\u2013194; Redmond & Hon 2014:\n158\u2013180).\n\nFor readers today, a major challenge of reading the Changes\nis overcoming the dichotomy between philosophy and divination. To many\nof us, divination and philosophy are diametrically opposed. Whereas\ndivination is based on a belief in a god or deity who communicates\nmessages to believers through coveted symbols or trusted mediums,\nphilosophy is based on rational thinking, cool-headed analysis, and\nprecise articulation. To the authors of Changes, however,\ndivination is intrinsically philosophical because its goal is to\nprovide an opportunity for self-reflection. While performing the\nritualistic acts of divination, the inquirers find a quiet moment to\nreview their past, examine their present, and make plans for the next\nstep. For the inquirers, it is unimportant whether there is a deity or\na spirit during the process of reflection, apprehension, and\nanticipation; it is more important that they reach a decision after\ncarefully evaluating the available options, and make critical moves to\nimprove their lives.\n\nIn the following, we will examine the philosophy of the\nChanges from four perspectives: the human finitude in the\ncosmic great dance, the need for decision-making to come to terms with\nchanges, the use of symbols to understand the complexity of the world,\nand the importance of rituals to find a direction in everyday life.\nTogether, these four aspects underscore both our limitations as\nsensitive souls constantly perplexed and perturbed by changes, and our\nabilities as sensible beings to face changes with courage and dignity.\nMore importantly, these four aspects help us appreciate the richness\nof the voluminous commentaries written on the Changes in\nimperial China. Despite their differences in tone, style, and\nstructure, these commentaries revealed the hidden meanings of the\nChanges and developed three distinctive approaches to come to\nterms with changes: the cosmological approach, the rational humanistic\napproach change, and the divination approach.\n",
