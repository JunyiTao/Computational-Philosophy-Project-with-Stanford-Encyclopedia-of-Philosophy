    "main_text": "Biography || Ortega in Germany\n1.2 Ortega in Germany\n\nIn late February 1905, Ortega left Spain for Germany\n\u201cfleeing\u201d, he described later, \u201cthe vulgarity of my\ncountry to stuff myself with whatever I can get out of it\u201d\n(El Imparcial, 19 January, 1908, p. 1; Obras, X:\n24). This first trip to Germany resulted in an eight-month stay at the\nUniversity of Leipzig where he pursued the study of classical\nphilology and philosophy. Ortega\u2019s proficiency in German proved\ninadequate to study philology, but this linguistic deficiency did not\ndeter his enthusiasm: he enrolled in the Indo-European language and\nlinguistic courses taught by professors Brugmann and Meyer. Although\nthe time devoted to philological studies somewhat distracted him from\nthe philosophical training he sought initially, Ortega was introduced\nto the writings of Wilhelm von Humboldt, Ernest Renan, Hippolyte\nTaine, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Charles Darwin,\nand audited anatomy, physiology and psychology courses of Wilhelm\nWundt who, despite having been appointed the chair of philosophy,\nserved as professor of physiology and psychology at Leipzig. He\nreturned to Madrid in the summer of 1906, where he received word that\nhe had been granted a state stipend to resume his study in Germany for\nanother year. Within a few weeks, he left for the University of\nBerlin, where Wilhelm Dilthey, Friedrich Paulsen, Eduard Meyer,\nHeinrich W\u00f6lfflin, Georg Simmel, Carl Stumpf, Max Planck, and\nAlois Riehl were teaching. However, Ortega only attended Riehl\u2019s\nlectures while in Berlin, which he later came to regret as he missed\nthe opportunity to encounter two thinkers he would subsequently\nadmire: Dilthey and Simmel. Six months later, Ortega left Berlin for\nthe University of Marburg, where he began his philosophical studies,\njoining Nicolai Hartmann, Paul Scheffer, and Heinz Heimsoeth under the\nNeo-Kantian philosophers Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp. Once ensconced\nin \u201cthe citadel of Neo-Kantianism\u201d (Obras, VIII:\n32), Ortega studied Kant and the history of philosophy with Cohen and\npsychology and pedagogy with Natorp. The University of Marburg, with\nits inquiry into the logical foundation of the natural sciences and\nits emphasis on the epistemological and methodological facets of\nphilosophy, provided Ortega with the kind of philosophical grounding\nand training he had been seeking.\n",
