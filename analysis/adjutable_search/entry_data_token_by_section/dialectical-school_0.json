Historical and biographical information\n\nThe name \u2018Dialectical School\u2019 is used for a group of\nphilosophers active from the later 4th to the mid 3rd centuries BC who\nare referred to as members of the Dialectic sect (hairesis)\nor as dialecticians (dialektikoi) in some later ancient\nsources (Diogenes Laertius [DL] 1.19). Together with the Megarics,\nCyrenaics and Cynics, the Dialecticians count among the minor Socratic\nschools. Their main philosophical interest was in dialectical skill\nand accomplishment, including the development and resolution of\nlogical paradoxes. They also made several important positive\ncontributions to the development of propositional logic.\n\nThe Dialecticians were traditionally counted among the philosophers of\nthe Megaric School, founded by Euclides of Megara, author of Socratic\ndialogues (Grote 1885, 1:140; M. Kneale 1937; Mates 1953; Prior 1955;\nW. C. Kneale and Kneale 1962, 117). In antiquity, the best-known\nfigure from the Megaric School was Stilpo, who, like Euclides, was a\nnative of Megara. For reasons that will become clear, scholars now\ntypically use \u2018Mergaric\u2019 as the adjective describing a\nphilosophical grouping or position, while reserving\n\u2018Megarian\u2019 as an adjective describing an origin in city of\nMegara (the same distinction is marked in Ancient Greek). More recent\nscholarship has placed Diodorus and Philo in a Dialectical School,\nseparate from the Megaric School (Sedley 1977, 75 followed by Bobzien\n2011; Algra 1999, 47; Ebert 1991; Ebert 2008). In fact, disagreement\nover the existence of a Dialectical Sect went back to\nantiquity. Diogenes Laertius holds that the Dialecticians are a\nseparate \u2018ethical\u2019 sect, founded by Clinomachus, but tells\nus that an earlier historian, Hippobotus, does not think the\nDialectical is a separate sect (DL 1.19).\n\nBut the modern scholarly reason for positing the Dialectical School as\nseparate from the Megaric School has four basic elements.\n\nWe should distinguish a \u2018lineage\u2019 (diadoche)\nfrom a \u2018sect\u2019 (hairesis), which are the two main\nways ancient historiographers grouped philosophers. The first is the\ngenealogy of a philosopher in terms of teacher-student relationships.\nThe second is a \u2018school\u2019 in the sense of set of\nphilosophers with a shared core of doctrines, and some institutional\nconnection, for example a series of scholarchs. Everyone agrees that\nDiodorus and Philo are in the lineage of Euclides of Megara.\nThere was a Megaric Sect, which included at least Euclides and\nStilpo of Megara.\nThere was a Dialectical Sect, identified by 4th and 3rd century\ncontemporaries, which was not just a phase of or part of the Megaric\nsect. It included Diodorus and Philo.\nThe Dialectical Sect was one of the ten ethical sects identified\nby Diogenes Laertius (DL 1.19).\n\n\n(3) is the important claim for establishing that there was a separate\nDialectical School. Sedley defends (3) with the following argument:\nStilpo won over three students \u2018from the Dialecticians\u2019\n(DL 2.114). Since Stilpo was a member of the Megaric School this must\nmean that the \u2018Dialecticians\u2019 were a separate, and rival,\ngroup from Stilpo\u2019s Megaric sect (Sedley 1977, 75\u201376).\n\nSome try to reject Sedley\u2019s conclusion by admitting that the\nDialecticians were a group that was identified in antiquity as\nseparate from the Megaric sect, but the Dialectical group was not,\nstrictly, a sect in the technical sense used by ancient\nhistoriographers. The is because the Dialectical group lacked the\nrequired institutional framework, such as a succession of scholarchs\nor core set of doctrines (DL 1.20; D\u00f6ring 1989, 309; cf. Allen\n2018, 44\u201346). But, of course, the Megarics also lacked such a\nstructure. On (4), the evidence that the Dialectical group is\nidentical to the Dialecticians mentioned at (DL 1.19), or even that\nthere was such a sect, is weak. Diogenes places the Dialectical sect\nin a set of ethical sects, but no evidence attributes to any putative\nmember of the sect any ethical views (unless one holds that fatalism\nis an ethical view). We can safely call Diodorus and Philo\nDialecticians in the sense of belonging to a distinctive philosophical\ngroup, rival to Stilpo\u2019s circle, but sharing a philosophical\ngenealogy with it. Whether this group was the Dialectical Sect, or a\nsect at all, in the sense used by ancient historiographers, is less\ncertain because we do not know whether the members of the Dialectical\nSchool were connected by an institution comparable to other ancient\nphilosophical schools, or whether their union under one name in later\nreports was based more loosely on their common philosophical\ninterest in dialectic.\n\n\nThose later reports give Clinomachus of Thurii, a pupil of Eubulides\nof Miletus, as founder of the school, but may have been given this\ntitle only in hindsight (DL 1.19 and 2.112, Sedley 1977 n.16).\nEuphantus of Olyntus, another pupil of Eubulides, probably born before\n349 BC, may have been the earliest member of the school. The name\n\u2018Dialectical School\u2019 is reported to have been introduced\nby its member Dionysius of Chalcedon, active around 320 BC because of\nthe practice of putting arguments in question and answer form (DL\n2.106; Castagnoli 2010, 157).\n\nThe most important philosopher of the sect is Dionysius\u2019\ncontemporary, Diodorus Cronus, who taught in Athens and Alexandria\naround 315\u2013284 BC. He left no writings but is the most\ninfluential member of the Dialectical School. Diodorus\u2019 most\nfamous pupil is Zeno of Citium, founder Stoicism. The dialectician\nAristides belongs to the same generation as Diodorus Cronus. Alexinus\n(c. 339\u2013265) may have belonged to the sect. The second important\nphilosopher of the Dialectical School is the logician Philo (sometimes\nreferred to as Philo of Megara, although we do not know his city of\norigin); he studied with Diodorus. He wrote a dialogue\nMenexenos and possibly a work On Signs and a work\nOn Schemata. All of these are lost. Diodorus Cronus\u2019\nfive daughters Menexene, Argeia, Theognis, Artemisia and Pantacleia\nare all said to have been logicians, and thus may have belonged to the\nschool. Finally, the dialectician Panthoides flourished\nc.280\u2013275 BC, and the dialecticians Aristoteles and Artemidorus\ncan be dated around 250 BC.\n\nOriginal philosophical contributions are testified only for Diodorus\nCronus and Philo, in the areas of logic, language and theory of motion\n(for more on Diodorus\u2019 contributions see entries\n Ancient Atomism\n and\n Diodorus Cronus);\n their views on logic were influential on Stoic logic, which in turn\nanticipated many of the developments in 20th century logic.\nPhilosophers of the Dialectic sect had an impact also on Epicurean,\nPeripatetic, and Sceptic philosophy, and seem to have interacted in\ndiscussion with members of most Hellenistic philosophical schools.\nDiodorus Cronus\u2019 modal theory and his Master Argument served as\na major philosophical inspiration for\n Arthur Prior.",
