    "main_text": "The New Cosmopolitanism and Beyond || Colonialism\n4.3 Colonialism\n\nAn increasingly important challenge to the institutionalist paradigm\nof global justice is the historical legacy and contemporary effects of\ncolonialism. The idea that our obligations of distributive justice as\ndetermined by our current institutions might be undermined by\nthe idea that the historical relationship of colonialism has\ntremendous influence on current distributions of wealth and power. The\nfocus on colonialism has three aspects though this section will focus\nmostly on the second and third. First, there is a growing interest in\nwhether the early modern progenitors of the social contract tradition\nwere ideologically complicit in European imperialism. In particular,\nthere is a lively debate concerning how Kant\u2019s account of\nhospitality and cosmopolitan right can used to critique colonial and\nneo-colonial relations (Flikschuh & Ypi 2014). Second, there is a\nsignificant\u2014and mostly cosmopolitan in orientation\u2014debate\nconcerning precisely what makes colonialism unjust or wrong. Third,\ngiven the wrong of colonialism and the likely reverberation of its\nnegative effects onto the present, there is the question\nof rectificatory global justice. That is, colonial powers\nhave some distributive duties in virtue of the fact that they must\nrepair the harm caused by their imperial endeavors.\n\nIt is obviously true that the history of colonialism is replete with\nan almost unparalleled violence (Fanon 1961; Walter 2017). Yet, it\nseems equally clear that a colonial relationship that was essentially\nfree of this sort of violence\u2014or where the level of violence was\nconsiderably lower than the pre-colonial political\nsituation\u2014would still be morally unacceptable. The question of\nwhat precisely grounds the wrongness of colonialism is an attempt to\ngrapple with difficult questions of procedural justice, sovereignty,\nand legitimacy\u2014and how these ideas affect our current\nunderstanding of global distributive justice.  Lea Ypi, for example,\nargues that colonialism is wrong because it represents a wrongfully\nunequal political relationship between the ruler and the ruled (Ypi\n2013; see also Lu 2017). Thus, the defining feature of colonialism is\nset of unequal and non-reciprocal terms of political association. This\nfeature of colonialism makes it uniquely wrong even if the\ncolonizers refrain from atrocities, the colonized have no strongly\nclaims\u2014property or otherwise\u2014to the land being taken, or\nthe colonized lack significant rights to self-determination. This\nview, however, does give rise to a serious concern about how we should\nunderstand coercive associative political projects where the terms of\nassociation being offered are comparatively equitable. That is,\nimagine some more powerful state that comes to a weaker group of\npeople and offers them an offer of political association that is both\nhard to refuse and, yet, based upon equitable terms. Ypi suggests that\nequitable terms of association are decisively undermined if the weaker\nparty does not consent, so it must be true that the\n\u201ccolonized\u201d group consents. And yet, it is at least\npossible to imagine cases where the weaker party sees the benefit of\nassociation and therefore consents to the association in ways that\ngive rises to concerns of colonialism. In other words, Ypi\u2019s\naccount may miss a feature of colonialism that gives rise to its\ndistinctiveness as a wrong (Valentini 2015). In most cases, the\ncriticism of Ypi\u2019s account lies in nature of the entity to which\nreciprocal association is owed: the colonized understood as\nindividuals, as corporate bodies, or as a plurality. This is\nespecially important because Ypi\u2019s account\u2014in order to be\ndistinct\u2014must not rely upon nationalism or some sort of\ncorporate ownership of specific territory, and it remains an open\nwhether her account can effectively avoid so relying. At any rate,\ndiscussions of how to precisely to characterize the wrong of\nself-determination are ongoing.\n\nFinally, colonialism gives rise to claims that the distribution of\nwealth globally ought to be re-ordered in order to satisfy the demands\nof rectificatory global justice. The claim is that rich nations in\ngeneral, or colonizing nations in particular, ought to transfer wealth\nor other valuable resources to poor nations in general or colonized\nnations in particular in virtue of the legacy of colonialism. It is\nimportant to see that these claims to rectification tend to be\npredicated upon the idea that there are contemporary effects of\ncolonial relations. For example, the \u201cnew\ninstitutionalists\u201d (Acemoglu & Robinson 2012) suggest that\ndifferences in development are a consequence of geographically driven\ndifferences in colonial history. In some cases, the colonial\npowers\u2014often in the context of settler colonialism\u2014set up\nrelatively effective institutions with the rule of law and strong\nproperty rights. In other contexts, the colonial powers set up\nextractive institutions. These extractive institutions set up strong\nincentive structures for the \u201cliberated\u201d de-colonized\nelites to maintain the extractive nature of these institutions,\ninhibiting development. This is often encouraged\u2014through\ncorruption, military intervention, and less obviously criminal\neconomic manipulation\u2014by the former colonial powers themselves.\nAs a consequence, the initial extractive equilibrium is hard to\ndispel. This account creates a complication for rectificatory views,\nwhich is that this view relies on the bad actions of local elites to\nsustain the equilibrium and so complicates the question of who,\nprecisely, is responsible for the poor current state of many states\n(Lomasky & Tes\u00f3n 2015). Nonetheless, many have argued that\nthe contemporary effects\u2014whether though the imposition of\ninstitutional forms or debt\u2014of colonialism generates a special\nobligation to provide, for example, debt relief (Jaggar 2002), open\nborders (Amighetti & Nuti 2016) or additional emissions permits\n(Blomfield 2015). Yet, these views face some significant hurdles. They\nhave difficulty in generating a general obligation by rich nations to\nhelp poor nations; rather, they generate obligations for colonizing\nstates to help their former colonies. And while it may be true these\nrelations mostly track the needs of the present, there is no\nrequirement that they do so and, indeed, there seem to be cases where\nthe requirement to assist needy countries and the requirement to help\nnations that have been negatively affected by colonialism conflict.\nSo, rectificatory views must either accept that sometimes states will\nbe obligated to rectify in cases where the objects of the obligation\nare not particularly needy or need to suggest that a broader\nparticipation in an ongoing system of neo-colonial economic relations\nis sufficient to activate the obligations. Yet, if we adopt this\nlatter interpretation, then it is unclear that this view is truly\ndifferent from left institutionalist views described above. If the\nformer, then the claims of colonialism do not appear to be as urgent\nas distributive obligations. Furthermore, the nature of the claim to\ncompensation depends on characterizing the relevant baseline: are we\ncomparing the plight of the former colonies to how they would have\nbeen without colonization or a world where the colonizers acted\njustly? Each of these answers have their issues, with the former being\ntoo permissive towards colonialism and the latter collapsing into\nother views of justice. It is hard to deny that the legacy of\ncolonialism is significant in a variety of applied issues\u2014from\ntrade to climate change to humanitarian intervention\u2014and the\ngrowing interest in its effects and normative consequences is a\nwelcome development; the philosophical difficulties of addressing that\nlegacy, however, are likely to prove difficult indeed.\n4.4. Property Rights\n\nWe can conclude this discussion of distributive justice by discussing\nsome recent work on global economic justice that rejects the Rawlsian\nlegacy in a more thoroughgoing manner. Much of this work begins with a\nconcern for property rights, understood in terms that make them prior\nto\u2014and, thus, constraints upon\u2014principles of distributive\njustice. Rawlsian distributive justice, of course, is compatible with\nthe defense of property rights; but those rights are taken to be\nconstructed out of the theory of justice\u2014they do not, as it\nwere, exist before the discussion of economic justice. For many\ntheorists, however, property rights must be respected as inputs to our\ntheorizing about global distributive justice\u2014rather than as\noutputs of that theorizing. \n\nThree sorts of theories have recently been put forward into the\ndebates surrounding global economic justice. The first\u2014which we\nwill call right libertarians\u2014take individual rights to\nacquire and trade in property as foundational for any analysis of\nglobal economic justice. The second\u2014who take their inspiration\nfrom the left libertarian tradition\u2014take common\nproperty rights in the world as a basis for theorizing about global\ndistributive justice. The final\u2014who can be termed theorists of\nnational property rights\u2014take the right of a\nnation\u2019s people to use and exploit its natural resources as\nfoundational for thinking about global justice. We can discuss these\nin turn.\n4.4.1 Right libertarianism\n\nThe debate between libertarian and liberal theories of distributive\njustice is a long-standing one within analytic political philosophy;\nRobert Nozick\u2019s Anarchy, State, and Utopia offered a\nchallenge to Rawlsian conceptions of distributive justice (Nozick\n1974). Nozick argued that a rightful respect for property rights made\nit impossible for a just state to pursue \u201cpatterned\u201d\nprinciples of distributive justice. The right to property, if\nrespected, would make such principles of economic equality chimerical\nat best, and totalitarian at worst. \n\nIdeas such as those of Nozick have only recently been applied to the\nglobal level. Bas van der Vossen and Jason Brennan (2018) have\ndefended the thought that economic freedom would, if applied at the\nglobal level, lead to greater wealth\u2014and greater human\nflourishing\u2014than any attempt to pursue some particular pattern\nof wealth and poverty. In particular, they argue, social scientific\ndata indicate that policy interventions designed to narrow the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor tends to do more harm than good; good\nintentions, they note, are inadequate to ensure good results. Loren\nLomasky and Fernando Tes\u00f3n (2015), similarly defend the thought\nthat individual property rights would, if defended universally, lead\nto a significant reduction in global poverty. It is only by\nuniversalizing respect for individual property rights, they argue,\nthat the global poverty can be reduced. \n\nThese arguments are, of course, intended to undermine global\ndistributive justice as an independent goal, much as Nozick intended\nhis work to undermine the Rawlsian belief than the gap between the\nrich and the poor was itself a relevant consideration for social\njustice. As such, the same arguments that have been made against\nNozick might also hold true for those who defend libertarianism at the\nglobal level. In the first instance, we might note that there is, on\nthese views, no independent worry about the size of the gap between\nthe rich and the poor; even if the universalization of property rights\nwere to produce an increase in overall wealth, there is nothing within\nthese theories that allows us to regard an increased inequality\nbetween the rich and the poor as problematic in its own right. This,\nof course, is not an objection to the libertarian view; it is,\ninstead, simply evidence that the libertarian and the liberal are\nmotivated by distinct moral concerns. But it is also worth noting that\nsome of what the libertarian says here is motivated by predictions\nabout what the globalization of individual property rights would\ndo. The libertarian is convinced that a global expansion of\nthose rights would produce a world of flourishing communities and\nflourishing individuals. Others, however, would worry that the\nuniversalization of libertarian rights might produce something\nentirely different\u2014that a world of unconstrained capitalism\nmight produce dystopia and rampant inequality, rather than perpetual\npeace. The debate between the global liberal and the global\nlibertarian is, then, going to turn upon both principle and\nprediction, in a way that makes this debate unlikely to be resolved\nsoon.\n4.4.2 Left libertarianism and common ownership\n\nIf the right-libertarian celebrates individual property rights, the\nleft-libertarian regards property rights as a collective phenomenon.\nLeft-libertarian thought is complex, and merits its own examination;\nwe will not provide an adequate analysis of that thought here. We\nmean, instead, to note that one particular left-libertarian\nidea\u2014that individual property rights in natural resources and in\nterritory must acknowledge the symmetrical claims of all human persons\nto the use of those goods\u2014has proven to be a fruitful one in\ntheorizing about global distributive justice.\n\nHillel Steiner (2005) argues that all individuals are equally entitled\nto benefit from the exploitation of natural resources; as such, those\nleft behind by territorial expropriation have the right to\ncompensation, through the creation of a proposed Global Fund. Mathias\nRisse (2012) has more recently argued in favor of common ownership of\nthe world\u2019s natural resources as an independent ground of\njustice. Risse\u2019s view is complex and polycentric, and includes\nsites on which global justice might be evaluated\u2014including\ncommon humanity, shared subjection to a coercive legal system, and the\nfact that humanity shares a limited set of territorial goods. It is\nthis latter aspect that is most relevant for our present discussion;\nRisse argues that the world\u2019s natural resources, since they are\nnot the result of any individual person\u2019s agency, must be\nregarded as subject to symmetrical claims from all human persons. This\nvision of the world as given to mankind in common, of course, is\nborrowed from early modern thinkers; Risse vindicates their concern\nwith natural resources, and argues that conclusions for both migration\nand for distributive justice can be derived from this ground.\n\nThese ideas are complex, and the debate over their relevance to global\njustice is likely to continue. One immediate worry, of course, is how\nto understand the relationship between that wealth created by natural\nresources, and that wealth created by human agency and ingenuity.\nSteiner and Risse both argue that the collective right to use the\nearth constrains what distribution of wealth can emerge at the global\nlevel; but both must provide some account of how to figure out what\ncounts as given to humans by God or by nature, from that which is\ncreated by humans using their brains and their agency. Steiner and\nRisse do, of course, engage with exactly that issue; but the precise\ncut between what is made by God and what is made by humanity is likely\nto be a continuing source of controversy.\n4.4.3 National property\n\nWe can conclude this section by examining a view on which property\nrights in the natural resources of a country are held by that set of\npeople who live within that particular country. This view is defended\nin Wenar (2015), who argues that it would be revolutionary\u2014in\nour world, as it emerges from colonialism and imperialism\u2014for us\nto regard the inhabitants of a given country as actually owning that\ncountry\u2019s national resources. Wenar notes, as does Pogge, that\nour current global institutions allow\u2014indeed,\nincentivize\u2014bad governance, by encouraging malign agents to gain\ncontrol of a coercive state and sell of the natural resources of that\nstate. Wenar, however, grounds this not in a cosmopolitan vision of\nRawlsian right, but instead upon a view on which the territorial goods\ncontained within a country are owned by the inhabitants of that\ncountry. Those who would sell those goods without the consent of the\npeople, then, are best understood as thieves\u2014whether or not\nthose thieves present themselves as the legitimate government of the\nsociety in question:\n\nIf we believe in popular resource sovereignty, there can be no such\nthing as a ruler who is benevolent with resource revenues. No one can\nbe generous by giving someone what they already own. The citizens of a\ncountry are entitled to all the value of their resources; the regime\nis entitled to not a penny. All of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil belongs to\nthe Saudi people, and the royals can only have their super yachts and\npalaces\u2014indeed, anything bought with the oil money\u2014at the\npeople\u2019s sufferance. A king\u2019s right is not to\n\u201call\u201d, it is to \u201cnothing\u201d (Wenar 2015:\n241).\n\nWenar\u2019s argument is not directly focused on global distributive\njustice, so much as it is focused on the avoidance of Western\ncomplicity in tyranny and dispossession; Wenar defends Western legal\ninstruments intended to avoid participation in unjustified resource\nsales, instead of principles of global distributive justice.\nNevertheless, this vision of collective property rights over natural\ngoods might be thought to pose an independent check on what sorts of\nredistributive policy are available, similar to the libertarian views\ndiscussed above. And, similarly, it is possible to object to\nWenar\u2019s view, with reference to whether or not this way of\nconstructing property rights is morally defensible (see generally\nWenar et al. 2018). In particular, the cosmopolitan might reject the\nthought that a Saudi citizen (say) has a greater claim than others to\nexploit the Saudi oilfields, simply because of his birth within the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. Wenar\u2019s view, nonetheless, is an\nimportant recent addition to the philosophical discussion of global\ndistributive justice, and debate about that view is likely to\ncontinue.\n5. Future directions\n\nIt is rarely a smart move to make predictions within philosophy.\nNevertheless, it is perhaps appropriate to offer a few views about\nwhat we are likely to see in future work about global justice. The\nfirst, following on our discussion of Pogge\u2019s work, is an\nincreased engagement by philosophers with empirical evidence and\nempirical methods. Apart from the pure egalitarians, political\nphilosophers all make assumptions about the nature and powers of\nglobal institutions; these assumptions can be grounded\u2014or\nrefuted\u2014by engagement with international lawyers, development\neconomists, and the like. To some extent, this engagement is already\nhappening (Reddy & Pogge 2010; Hassoun & Subramanian 2012;\nBenatar & Brock 2011). More of this engagement is, we believe,\nboth likely and likely to be beneficial. \n The second trend we would identify is that there is increasingly\nlikely a need for political philosophy dealing with specific global\nphenomena. Much of what we have dealt with here has looked only at the\nmacro-level phenomenon of global inequality. A full analysis of global\njustice will also look at specific forms of human institution and\nagency that are likely to be relevant from the standpoint of justice.\nWe have already mentioned, if only in passing, the issues of\nimmigration, fairness in trade, and feminism. We would conclude here\nby mentioning some other areas of inquiry that might become\nincreasingly important. Buchanan (2009) and Pogge (2009) have both\nproduced recent work on global incentives for pharmaceutical\nresearch. Ypi, Goodin, & Barry (2009) have written on the issue of\nglobal debt relief. Gardiner (2004) and Caney (2008, 2009) have\nwritten on the relationship of global climate change and global\ninequality. Increasingly, we believe that these sorts of analyses are\nlikely to proliferate, and philosophers come to terms not just with\nthe fact of inequality, but with the plurality of different reasons\nfor\u2014and solutions to\u2014that inequality.  Political\nphilosophy has only recently turned its attention to questions of\nglobal justice; it is our hope that this attention will deepen in\nyears to come, as we gain more understanding of the nature and causes\nof global underdevelopment and inequality.\n The final trend might be the most important; we are increasingly\nwilling to move beyond the questions that animated Rawlsian analyses\nof global distributive justice, to a broader consideration of the\nagents and institutions that might be implicated in our global\nprocesses of production. Iris Marion Young (2011) raises some\nimportant questions about how to begin to understand the various\nagents whose acts might be constrained by moral theorizing\u2014and\nhow to understand the distinct ways in which our identities, as\nconsumers and as citizens, might be implicated in the replication of\npoverty and inequality. Although this entry began with an examination\nof the Rawlsian tradition of thinking about distributive justice, it\nis an entirely good thing that the philosophical literature is\nincreasingly willing to move beyond that tradition. As global\nrelationships become more complicated and more central, we stand in\nneed of more theorizing about how to understand the relationship\nbetween global wealth and global poverty\u2014and about the moral\nprinciples within which that relationship is to be understood.",
