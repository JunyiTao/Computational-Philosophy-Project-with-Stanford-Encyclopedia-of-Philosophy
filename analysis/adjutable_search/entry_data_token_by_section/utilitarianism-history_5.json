    "main_text": "Ideal Utilitarianism\n4. Ideal Utilitarianism\n\n\nG. E. Moore strongly disagreed with the hedonistic value theory\nadopted by the Classical Utilitarians. Moore agreed that we ought\nto promote the good, but believed that the good included far more than\nwhat could be reduced to pleasure. He was a pluralist, rather\nthan a monist, regarding intrinsic value. For example, he\nbelieved that \u2018beauty\u2019 was an intrinsic good. A\nbeautiful object had value independent of any pleasure it might\ngenerate in a viewer. Thus, Moore differed from Sidgwick who\nregarded the good as consisting in some consciousness. Some objective\nstates in the world are intrinsically good, and on Moore's view,\nbeauty is just such a state. He used one of his more notorious\nthought experiments to make this point: he asked the reader to\ncompare two worlds, one was entirely beautiful, full of things which\ncomplemented each other; the other was a hideous, ugly world, filled\nwith \u201ceverything that is most disgusting to us.\u201d Further,\nthere are not human beings, one imagines, around to appreciate or be\ndisgusted by the worlds. The question then is, which of these worlds is\nbetter, which one's existence would be better than the\nother's? Of course, Moore believed it was clear that the\nbeautiful world was better, even though no one was around to appreciate\nits beauty. This emphasis on beauty was one facet of\nMoore's work that made him a darling of the Bloomsbury\nGroup. If beauty was a part of the good independent of its\neffects on the psychological states of others \u2014 independent of,\nreally, how it affected others, then one needn't sacrifice\nmorality on the altar of beauty anymore. Following beauty is not\na mere indulgence, but may even be a moral obligation. Though\nMoore himself certainly never applied his view to such cases, it does\nprovide the resources for dealing with what the contemporary literature\nhas dubbed \u2018admirable immorality\u2019 cases, at least some of\nthem. Gauguin may have abandoned his wife and children, but it\nwas to a beautiful end.\n\n\nMoore's targets in arguing against hedonism were the earlier\nutilitarians who argued that the good was some state of consciousness\nsuch as pleasure. He actually waffled on this issue a bit, but\nalways disagreed with Hedonism in that even when he held that beauty\nall by itself was not an intrinsic good, he also held that for the\nappreciation of beauty to be a good the beauty must actually be there,\nin the world, and not be the result of illusion.\n\n\nMoore further criticized the view that pleasure itself was\nan intrinsic good, since it failed a kind of isolation test that he\nproposed for intrinsic value. If one compared an empty universe\nwith a universe of sadists, the empty universe would strike one as\nbetter. This is true even though there is a good deal of\npleasure, and no pain, in the universe of sadists. This would\nseem to indicate that what is necessary for the good is at least the\nabsence of bad intentionality. The pleasures of sadists, in\nvirtue of their desires to harm others, get discounted \u2014 they are\nnot good, even though they are pleasures. Note this radical\ndeparture from Bentham who held that even malicious pleasure was\nintrinsically good, and that if nothing instrumentally bad attached to the\npleasure, it was wholly good as well.\n\n\nOne of Moore's important contributions was to put forward an\n\u2018organic unity\u2019 or \u2018organic whole\u2019 view of\nvalue. The principle of organic unity is vague, and there is some\ndisagreement about what Moore actually meant in presenting it.\nMoore states that \u2018organic\u2019 is used \u201c\u2026to\ndenote the fact that a whole has an intrinsic value different in amount\nfrom the sum of the values of its parts.\u201d (PE, 36) And, for\nMoore, that is all it is supposed to denote. So, for example, one\ncannot determine the value of a body by adding up the value of its\nparts. Some parts of the body may have value only in relation to\nthe whole. An arm or a leg, for example, may have no value at all\nseparated from the body, but have a great deal of value attached to the\nbody, and increase the value of the body, even. In the section of\nPrincipia Ethica on the Ideal, the principle of organic unity\ncomes into play in noting that when persons experience pleasure through\nperception of something beautiful (which involves a positive emotion in\nthe face of a recognition of an appropriate object \u2014 an emotive\nand cognitive set of elements), the experience of the beauty is better\nwhen the object of the experience, the beautiful object, actually\nexists. The idea was that experiencing beauty has a small positive\nvalue, and existence of beauty has a small positive value, but\ncombining them has a great deal of value, more than the simple addition\nof the two small values (PE, 189 ff.). Moore noted:\n\u201cA true belief in the reality of an object greatly increases the\nvalue of many valuable wholes\u2026\u201d (199).\n\n\nThis principle in Moore \u2014 particularly as applied to the\nsignificance of actual existence and value, or knowledge and value,\nprovided utilitarians with tools to meet some significant\nchallenges. For example, deluded happiness would be severely\nlacking on Moore's view, especially in comparison to happiness\nbased on knowledge.\n",
