    "main_text": "Varieties of Non-Evidentialism || Conservative non-evidentialism\n6.2 Conservative non-evidentialism\n\nConservatism (sometimes also called dogmatism,\nthough the latter is usually thought to be a view about perceptual\nbelief in particular; see Pryor 2000, White 2006) is the view that one\nis prima facie justified in believing that p if in\nfact one does believe that p (Harman 1986, Owens 2000).\nAnother version of it says that one is prima facie justified\nin believing that p if it seems to one that p is\ntrue (Huemer 2007a) or at least perceptually seems to one\nthat p is true (Pryor 2000). In order to be all things\nconsidered justified on either of these conservatisms, one must be\naware of no undefeated defeaters for p. But the absence of\nundefeated defeaters for p, even if one is aware of it, is\nnot positive evidence for p, and any\n\u201cimpulsional\u201d urge towards p or seeming that\np is true is not the kind of evidence that Evidentialists\nthink we should seek (see Conee and Feldman 2004, ch. 3; for\nimpulsional evidence see Plantinga 1993, 192). So on at least most\naccounts of what \u201cevidence\u201d is, conservatism is an\nimportant kind of Non-Evidentialism according to which some justified\nbeliefs\u2014the immediately justified ones\u2014are not based on\nsufficient evidence.\n\nConservatism is regarded by some philosophers as a useful tool against\nskepticism (Christensen 1994, Huemer 2007a), and its\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d flavor is sometimes made more palatable by\ncombining it with various moderate or localized Evidentialisms. Thus,\nfor example, conservatism about beliefs that go into the foundation of\nour knowledge structure (including beliefs about basic mathematical or\nmoral truths) might very naturally be combined with a kind of\nEvidentialism about beliefs that are not in the foundation (for more\non foundationalism in epistemology, see\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification).\n\nNote that conservatives need not say that any of the beliefs we have\nare infallible or incapable of being undermined. Indeed, they might be\nquite open to the fallibilist thought that our current justified\nbeliefs can be defeated (either rebutted or undercut) by new evidence.\nSo the view doesn't promote belief that is \u201cdogmatic\u201d or\n\u201cconservative\u201din some disparaging sense: it says merely\nthat some beliefs that we have, or some \u201cimpelling\u201d\nbeliefs, needn't be based on positive evidential (or practical)\nsupport in order to be justified (Harman 1986, Lycan 1988, Chisholm\n1989, McGrath 2007).\n",
