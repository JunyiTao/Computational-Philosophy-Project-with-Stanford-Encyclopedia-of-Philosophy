    "main_text": "Arithmetic\n2. Arithmetic\n\nBut these remarks have been about foundations, and mathematics is not\nits foundations. Hence there is a further independent motive, to see\nwhat mathematical structure remains wherever the constraint\nof consistency is relaxed. But it would be wrong to regard this as in\nany way a repudiation of the structures studied in classical\nmathematics: inconsistent structures represent an addition to\nknown structures.\n\nRobert K. Meyer (1976) seems to have been the first to think of an\ninconsistent arithmetical theory. At this point, he was more\ninterested in the fate of a consistent theory, his relevant arithmetic\nR#. This amounts to the axioms for Peano arithmetic, with a base of\nthe quantified relevant logic RQ, and Meyer hoped that the weaker base\nof relevant logic would allow more models. He was right. There proved\nto be a whole class of inconsistent arithmetical theories; see Meyer\nand Mortensen (1984), for example. In a parallel with the above\nremarks on rehabilitating logicism, Meyer argued that these\narithmetical theories provide the basis for a revived Hilbert Program.\nHilbert\u2019s program was the project of rigorously formalising\nmathematics and proving its consistency by simple finitary/inductive\nprocedures. It was widely held to have been seriously damaged by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Second Incompleteness Theorem, according to which\nthe consistency of arithmetic was unprovable within arithmetic itself.\nBut a consequence of Meyer\u2019s construction was that within his\narithmetic R# it was demonstrable by finitary means that whatever\ncontradictions there might happen to be, they could not adversely\naffect any numerical calculations. Hence Hilbert\u2019s goal of\nconclusively demonstrating that mathematics is trouble-free proves\nlargely achievable as long as inconsistency-tolerant logics are\nused.\n\nThe arithmetical models used by Meyer and Mortensen later proved to\nallow inconsistent representation of the truth predicate. They also\npermit representation of structures beyond natural number arithmetic,\nsuch as rings and fields, including their order properties.\nAxiomatisations were also provided. Recently, the finite inconsistent\narithmetical collapse models, a strictly larger class than those\nstudied by Meyer and Mortensen, have been completely characterised by\nGraham Priest. Collapse models are obtained from classical models by\ncollapsing the domain down to congruence classes generated by various\ncongruence relations. When members of the same congruence class are\nidentified, the theories produced are inconsistent. For example,\nMeyer\u2019s initial construction collapsed the integers under the\ncongruence modulo 2. This puts 0 and 2 in the same congruence\nclass, so that in a suitable three-valued logic, both 0=2 and\nnot-(0=2) hold. Priest showed that these models take a certain general\nform, see Priest (1997) and (2000). Strictly speaking, Priest went a\nlittle too far in including \u201cclique models\u201d. This was\ncorrected by Paris and Pathmanathan (2006), and extended into the\ninfinite by Paris and Sirokfskich (2008). Even more recently, Tedder\n(2015) obtained axiomatisations for the class of finite collapse\nmodels with a different background logic, Avron\u2019s A3.\n",
