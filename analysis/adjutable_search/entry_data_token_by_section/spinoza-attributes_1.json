    "main_text": "Attributes in the Ethics || What are Attributes?\n1.1 What are Attributes?\n\nSpinoza is not the first to furnish his metaphysics with attributes\nand in that he is following a very long tradition. He is, though,\nmostly influenced by Descartes, and in some ways is trying to keep\nwith Descartes\u2019 notion of \u201cattribute.\u201d It therefore\nwill be useful to look back and get a sense of what Descartes had in\nmind and thus get a preliminary grasp (which will be revised) of what\nSpinoza means by \u201cattribute.\u201d Descartes states in the\nPrinciples of Philosophy that attributes are the essence of a\nthing, so the essence of mind is thought or thinking, and the essence\nof body is to be extended (Principles, I, \u00a753, CSM, I,\np. 210, AT 25). To see why this is so, it is worth revisiting the\nfirst and second Meditations, even if very briefly. Let us\nbegin with body and Extension. To understand the essence of body, we\ncan look to the famous wax example in Meditation Two (CSM,\nII, p. 20\u201321, AT 30\u201332). While sitting by the fireplace,\nDescartes inspects a piece of wax and asks himself what he knows of\nthe wax. He begins by listing all the sensory properties of the wax:\nit is white, has a certain smell, makes a certain sound when one raps\nit with one\u2019s finger, is hard, and has a certain taste. After\nlisting all its sensory properties, he then places the piece of wax by\nthe fire and sees how it loses all those properties: it\nchanges color, smell, texture, taste, etc. Descartes concludes, among\nother things, that the essence of the wax, insofar as it is a body, is\nthat it is extended in length, breadth, and depth since that\nis the only thing that remains constant about the wax. In this\nrespect, the piece of wax is no different from any other\nbody\u2014that is, its essence is to be extended. Extension, then,\naccording to Descartes, is the essence of body. In the\nMeditations we also, famously, come to recognize our own\nessence as thinking things. We realize this by recognizing that we\ncannot doubt that we are doubting while doubting. Furthermore, we\nrealize that doubting in this sense is no different from\nunderstanding, affirming, denying, willing, unwilling, imagining, and\nhaving sense perceptions (seeming to see, etc.) (CSM, II, p. 19, AT\n28). Descartes then reaches the conclusion that the essence of the\nmind is Thought. For these reasons, Descartes claims that Thought and\nExtension are the principal attributes of mind and body and that they\nare \u201creally distinct\u201d, that is, they exist independently\none from the\n other.[4]\n It is important to note that for Descartes, any created\nsubstance has only one principal attribute, as opposed to God who\nhas infinite attributes.\n\nSpinoza adopts some aspects of the Cartesian set up while rejecting\nothers. He agrees that Thought and Extension are attributes (2P1, 2P2)\nand are related to essences (1D4). He agrees they are \u201creally\ndistinct\u201d from each other\n (1P10Schol).[5]\n Furthermore, he agrees that \u201cmind\u201d has to be conceived\nthrough Thought, and \u201cbody\u201d through Extension. (2P5 and\nits demonstration make the case with regard to ideas and Thought; 2D1\nestablishes it for bodies and Extension. This is also made very clear\nin 3P2 and its demonstration.) However, he does not agree that they\nare attributes of created substances, since he rejects the\npossibility of created substances altogether (1P6Cor., 1P8Schol1,\n1P14). One way to understand Spinoza is to see how he can hold both\nThought and Extension (and other attributes, if there are others) to\nbe divine attributes or attributes of one and the same (infinite)\n substance.[6]\n\n",
