    "main_text": "Responses to Revisionism || Ignorance and Epistemic Vices\n3.2 Ignorance and Epistemic Vices\n\nThe next position we\u2019ll consider goes a step further in\nrejecting the idea that responsibility requires awareness. According\nto this position, ignorant wrongdoers can be culpable for their\nignorance (and for actions performed out of it) even if the benighting\nacts that produced it were themselves performed out of ignorance of\ntheir wrongness. For this to be the case, it is claimed, is sufficient\nif in performing benighting acts agents exhibit epistemic\nvices that explain why they failed to improve their epistemic\nposition. On this view, then, the regress in the volitionists\u2019\nargument doesn\u2019t necessarily terminate in an episode of\nclear-eyed akrasia; it can also terminate in epistemically vicious\nconduct, regardless of whether the agent conceives it as such\n(Montmarquet 1995 & 1999; FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017). Notice\nthat this position is less conservative than weakened internalism,\nsince in the latter view culpability for ignorance requires awareness\nthat one has sufficient reasons to comply with certain epistemic\nobligations (Robichaud 2014: 145). By contrast, in the position\ncurrently under review no such awareness is required: an agent\u2019s\nepistemic vices might blind her to these reasons, and yet she can be\nblameworthy for ignorance resulting from her failure to comply with\nher epistemic obligations (Montmarquet 1999: 845; FitzPatrick 2008:\n606).\n\nPhilosophers who espouse this position thus deny thesis ii of the\nregress argument (according to which ignorance is culpable only if it\nderives from a benighting act performed in awareness of its wrongness)\nand, consequently, also deny thesis iii (that responsibility requires\noccurrent and de dicto beliefs about the action\u2019s\noverall wrongness), but only regarding benighting acts. So\nthey in effect posit an asymmetry in the epistemic requirements on\nblameworthiness: while blameworthiness for ordinary actions does\nrequire awareness of wrongdoing, blameworthiness for benighting acts\nand subsequent ignorance doesn\u2019t (FitzPatrick 2008: 609; see\nLevy 2009: 741 for criticism of this asymmetry). A further consequence\nis that they accept thesis i (that blameworthiness for actions\nperformed out of ignorance is always derivative) for all actions\nexcept for benighting acts (FitzPatrick 2008: 609 n.37; 2017: 32); and\naccept thesis iv as well (that both factual and moral ignorance can\nexculpate) (FitzPatrick 2008: 602; 2017: 35).\n\nFitzPatrick (2008) illustrates this position with the case of Mr.\nPotter, a powerful businessman who engages in ruthless business\npractices while thinking they are \u201cpermissibly\naggressive\u201d, therefore acting from ignorance of their wrongness.\nFitzPatrick (2008: 601, 609) agrees with volitionists that Mr. Potter\nis blameworthy for his ruthless business behavior only if (and\nbecause) he is blameworthy for the ignorance from which he acts; and\nalso agrees that if it turned out that he\u2019s blameless for the\nlatter, he\u2019d be blameless for the former as well (2008: 602).\nBut FitzPatrick sharply disagrees with volitionists on the conditions\nthat must be satisfied for ignorance to be culpable. In his view,\nignorance is culpable when it results from the violation of epistemic\nobligations regarding which the agent could reasonably have been\nexpected to comply given her cognitive capacities and the\nopportunities provided by her social context, and when such violation\nis due to the agent\u2019s epistemic vices such as\n\u201coverconfidence, arrogance, dismissiveness, laziness, dogmatism,\nincuriosity, self-indulgence, contempt, and so on\u201d (2008: 609).\nAccording to FitzPatrick, when this is the case the agent bears direct\nresponsibility for her ignorance even if her benighting\nacts\u2014i.e., the acts that evinced the epistemic vices just listed\n\u2014were themselves performed out of ignorance of their wrongness.\n(FitzPatrick\u2019s position, according to which culpability for\nunwitting wrongdoing is partially explained by the fact that the\nignorant agent should and could have known better has important\nsimilarities with the capacitarian view discussed in\n sect. 3.4\n below.)\n\nThis conception of culpable ignorance has been criticized on the\ngrounds that it isn\u2019t reasonable to expect epistemically vicious\nagents like Mr. Potter to do anything substantial to avoid or remedy\ntheir ignorance, at least not in the sense of \u2018reasonable\nexpectation\u2019 relevant for attributions of responsibility (Levy\n2009; Talbert 2013: 230\u20133). Levy argues that agents are\nblameworthy only \u201cif it is reasonable to expect them to conform\ntheir behavior to the appropriate normative standards\u201d and this,\nin turn, requires that \u201cconforming their behavior to normative\nstandards is something they can do rationally (and not merely by\nchance or accident)\u201d (2009: 735). However, Levy argues, the\nnotion of rationality relevant here is a \u201cthoroughly internalist\none\u201d, having to do with \u201cwhat I can decide to do as the\nresult of engaging in reasoning\u201d, that is, by deliberating on\nthe reasons I think I have for pursuing different courses of action\n(2009: 735). But in this internalist sense of \u2018rational\u2019,\nit isn\u2019t rational for Mr. Potter to do anything to correct his\nmoral outlook, given that by his lights the challenges to it that he\nencounters can rightly be dismissed as irrelevant. Levy concedes that\nin so thinking Mr. Potter exhibits epistemic vices, \u201cbut because\nhe does not conceive of them as vices, he has no internal\nreason\u201d for mending his ways and so it isn\u2019t reasonable to\nexpect him to do so (2009: 737). (See FitzPatrick 2017 for his\nresponse.)\n\nIn his arguments against the akrasia requirement on culpable\nignorance, Montmarquet goes further than FitzPatrick in that he denies\nthe thesis of doxastic involuntarism that plays an important role in\nthe regress argument. While FitzPatrick\u2019s objective is to\nestablish direct culpability for \u201cepistemically debilitating\nchoices\u201d (2008: 609, italics added),\nMontmarquet\u2019s main claim is that culpability for\nbeliefs themselves can be \u201cfundamental and\nunderived\u201d (1995: 43). This is because, in his view, agents\npossess \u201cdirect (albeit incomplete) control\u201d (1999: 844)\nover the formation of their beliefs. He agrees with volitionists\nthat\n\n\nif an agent is culpably ignorant of some fact, there will always have\nbeen some possible act or omission, but for which this ignorance would\nnot have existed, (1995: 42)\n\n\nbut he thinks that talk of benighting acts distracts us from the true\nsource of culpable ignorance, which is an \u201cintellectually\nirresponsible attitude\u201d and associated beliefs rather than\n\u201cthe acts and omissions to which that attitude and those beliefs\nled [the agent]\u201d (1995: 43).\n\nIn order to support his contention that agents can be directly\nculpable for holding certain beliefs, Montmarquet (1999: 844) argues,\nagainst Zimmerman 1997, that agents can in fact directly control their\nbeliefs by exercising direct control over the degree of care with\nwhich they form them. He offers the analogy of whistling carefully:\none can directly control the care one exerts in whistling, but this\ndoesn\u2019t imply that the whistling itself is only indirectly in\none\u2019s control; on the contrary, one directly controls both. If\nthe analogy holds, given that agents can directly control how careful\nthey are in forming their beliefs, they can also directly control\ntheir beliefs themselves and so it would follow that agents can be\ndirectly blameworthy for forming beliefs carelessly and for the\ncarelessly formed beliefs themselves. In response, Zimmerman (2002a;\n2008: 183\u20139) points out a disanalogy between the cases of\nwhistling carefully and forming beliefs carefully: while whistling is\nitself an action, believing something isn\u2019t an action but a\n(mental) state, which can be the result of the action of\ntaking care in forming beliefs. However, since we don\u2019t have\ndirect control over the results of our non-basic actions (taking care\nin forming beliefs being one of them), Zimmerman concludes that we\nlack direct control over our beliefs and so we can\u2019t be directly\nresponsible for them (2008: 188\u20139).\n",
