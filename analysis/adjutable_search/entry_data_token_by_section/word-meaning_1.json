    "main_text": "Basics || The Notion of Word\n1.1 The Notion of Word\n\nWe can distinguish two fundamental approaches to the notion of word.\nOn one side, we have linguistic approaches, which\ncharacterize the notion of word by reflecting on its explanatory role\nin linguistic research (for a survey on explanation in linguistics,\nsee Egr\u00e9 2015). These approaches often end up splitting the\nnotion of word into a number of more fine-grained and theoretically\nmanageable notions, but still tend to regard \u2018word\u2019 as a\nterm that zeroes in on a scientifically respectable concept (e.g., Di\nSciullo & Williams 1987). For example, words are the primary locus\nof stress and tone assignment, the basic domain of morphological\nconditions on affixation, clitization, compounding, and the theme of\nphonological and morphological processes of assimilation, vowel shift,\nmetathesis, and reduplication (Bromberger 2011).\n\nOn the other side, we have metaphysical approaches, which\nattempt to pin down the notion of word by inquiring into the\nmetaphysical nature of words. These approaches typically deal with\nsuch questions as \u201cwhat are words?\u201d, \u201chow should\nwords be individuated?\u201d, and \u201con what conditions two\nutterances count as utterances of the same word?\u201d. For example,\nKaplan (1990, 2011) has proposed to replace the orthodox type-token\naccount of the relation between words and word tokens with a\n\u201ccommon currency\u201d view on which words relate to their\ntokens as continuants relate to stages in four-dimensionalist\nmetaphysics (see the entries on\n types and tokens\n and\n identity over time).\n Other contributions to this debate can be found, a.o., in McCulloch\n(1991), Cappelen (1999), Alward (2005), Hawthorne & Lepore (2011),\nSainsbury & Tye (2012), Gasparri (2016), and Irmak\n(forthcoming).\n\nFor the purposes of this entry, we can rely on the following\nstipulation. Every natural language has a lexicon organized\ninto lexical entries, which contain information about word\ntypes or lexemes. These are the smallest linguistic\nexpressions that are conventionally associated with a\nnon-compositional meaning and can be articulated in isolation to\nconvey semantic content. Word types relate to word tokens and\noccurrences just like phonemes relate to phones in phonological\ntheory. To understand the parallelism, think of the variations in the\nplace of articulation of the phoneme /n/, which is pronounced as the\nvoiced bilabial nasal [m] in \u201cten bags\u201d and as the voiced\nvelar nasal [\u014b] in \u201cten gates\u201d. Just as phonemes are\nabstract representations of sets of phones (each defining one way the\nphoneme can be instantiated in speech), lexemes can be defined as\nabstract representations of sets of words (each defining one way the\nlexeme can be instantiated in sentences). Thus, \u2018do\u2019,\n\u2018does\u2019, \u2018done\u2019 and \u2018doing\u2019 are\nmorphologically and graphically marked realizations of the same\nabstract word type do. To wrap everything into a single\nformula, we can say that the lexical entries listed in a\nlexicon set the parameters defining the instantiation\npotential of word types in sentences, utterances and inscriptions (cf.\nMurphy 2010). In what follows, unless otherwise indicated, our talk of\n\u201cword meaning\u201d should be understood as talk of \u201cword\ntype meaning\u201d or \u201clexeme meaning\u201d, in the sense we\njust illustrated.\n",
