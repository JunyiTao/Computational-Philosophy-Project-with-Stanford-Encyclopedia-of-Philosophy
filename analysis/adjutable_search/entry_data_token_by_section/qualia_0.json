Consider your visual experience as\nyou stare at a bright turquoise color patch in a paint store. There is\nsomething it is like for you subjectively to undergo that experience.\nWhat it is like to undergo the experience is very different from what\nit is like for you to experience a dull brown color patch. This\ndifference is a difference in what is often called \u2018phenomenal\ncharacter\u2019. The phenomenal character of an experience is what it\nis like subjectively to undergo the experience. If you are told to\nfocus your attention upon the phenomenal character of your experience,\nyou will find that in doing so you are aware of certain qualities.\nThese qualities \u2014 ones that are accessible to you when you\nintrospect and that together make up the phenomenal character of the\nexperience are sometimes called \u2018qualia\u2019. C.S. Peirce\nseems to have had something like this in mind when he introduced the\nterm \u2018quale\u2019 into philosophy in 1866 (1866/1982, para\n223).\n\nThere are more restricted uses of the term \u2018qualia\u2019,\nhowever.\n\n(2) Qualia as properties of sense data. Consider a painting of a\ndalmatian. Viewers of the painting can apprehend not only its content\n(i.e., its representing a dalmatian) but also the colors, shapes, and\nspatial relations obtaining among the blobs of paint on the canvas. It\nhas sometimes been supposed that being aware or conscious of a visual\nexperience is like viewing an inner, non-physical picture or\nsense-datum. So, for example, on this conception, if I see a\ndalmatian, I am subject to a mental picture-like representation of a\ndalmatian (a sense-datum), introspection of which reveals to me both\nits content and its intrinsic, non-representational features\n(counterparts to the visual features of the blobs of paint on the\ncanvas). These intrinsic, non-representational features have been\ntaken by advocates of the sense-datum theory to be the sole\ndeterminants of what it is like for me to have the experience. In a\nsecond, more restricted sense of the term \u2018qualia\u2019, then,\nqualia are intrinsic, consciously accessible, non-representational\nfeatures of sense-data and other non-physical phenomenal objects that\nare responsible for their phenomenal character. Historically, the term\n\u2018qualia\u2019 was first used in connection with the sense-datum\ntheory by C.I. Lewis in 1929. As Lewis used the term, qualia were\nproperties of sense-data themselves.\n\n(3) Qualia as intrinsic non-representational properties. There is\nanother established sense of the term \u2018qualia\u2019, which is\nsimilar to the one just given but which does not demand of qualia\nadvocates that they endorse the sense-datum theory. However sensory\nexperiences are ultimately analyzed \u2014 whether, for example, they\nare taken to involve relations to sensory objects or they are\nidentified with neural events or they are held to be physically\nirreducible events \u2014 many philosophers suppose that they have\nintrinsic, consciously accessible features that are\nnon-representational and that are solely responsible for their\nphenomenal character. These features, whatever their ultimate nature,\nphysical or non-physical, are often dubbed \u2018qualia\u2019.\n\nIn the case of visual experiences, for example, it is frequently\nsupposed that there is a range of visual qualia, where these are taken\nto be intrinsic features of visual experiences that (a) are accessible\nto introspection, (b) can vary without any variation in the\nrepresentational contents of the experiences, (c) are mental\ncounterparts to some directly visible properties of objects (e.g.,\ncolor), and (d) are the sole determinants of the phenomenal character\nof the experiences. This usage of \u2018qualia\u2019 has become\nperhaps the most common one in recent years. Philosophers who hold or\nhave held that there are qualia, in this sense of the term, include,\nfor example, Nagel (1974), Peacocke (1983) and Block (1990).\n\n(4) Qualia as intrinsic, nonphysical, ineffable properties. Some\nphilosophers (e.g, Dennett 1987, 1991) use the term\n\u2018qualia\u2019 in a still more restricted way so that qualia are\nintrinsic properties of experiences that are also ineffable,\nnonphysical, and \u2018given\u2019 to their subjects incorrigibly\n(without the possibility of error). Philosophers who deny that there\nare qualia sometimes have in mind qualia as the term is used in this\nmore restricted sense (or a similar one). It is also worth mentioning\nthat sometimes the term \u2018qualia\u2019 is restricted to sensory\nexperiences by definition, while on other occasions it is allowed that\nif thoughts and other such cognitive states have phenomenal character,\nthen they also have qualia. Thus, announcements by philosophers who\ndeclare themselves opposed to qualia need to be treated with some\ncaution. One can agree that there are no qualia in the last three\nsenses I have explained, while still endorsing qualia in the standard\nfirst sense.\n\nIn the rest of this entry, we use the term \u2018qualia\u2019 in the\nvery broad way I did at the beginning of the entry. So, we take it for\ngranted that there are qualia. Later on, in section 8, we discuss\nspecifically the view of qualia as intrinsic, nonrepresentational\nproperties.\n",
