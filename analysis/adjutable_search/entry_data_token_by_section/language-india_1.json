    "main_text": "Conception of Language among Sanskrit grammarians\n2. Conception of Language among Sanskrit grammarians\n\nBefore the emergence of the formalized philosophical systems or the\ndar\u015banas, we see a number of philosophical issues\nrelating to language implicitly and explicitly brought out by the\nearly Sanskrit grammarians, namely P\u0101\u1e47ini,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali. P\u0101\u1e47ini (400 bce)\ncomposed his grammar of Sanskrit with a certain\nnotion of Sanskrit as an atemporal language. For him, there were\nregional dialects of Sanskrit, as well as variation of usage in its\nscriptural (chandas) and contemporary\n(bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101) domains. All these domains are\ntreated as sub-domains of a unified language, which is not restricted\nby any temporality.\n\nPata\u00f1jali\u2019s Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya refers to the\nviews of Vy\u0101\u1e0di and V\u0101japy\u0101yana on the meaning of\nwords. Vy\u0101\u1e0di argued that words like \u201ccow\u201d\ndenote individual instances of a certain class, while\nV\u0101japy\u0101yana argued that words like \u201ccow\u201d denote\ngeneric properties or class properties (\u0101k\u1e5bti),\nsuch as cowness, that are shared by all members of certain classes.\nPata\u00f1jali presents a long debate on the extreme positions in\nthis argument, and finally concludes that both the individual\ninstances and the class property must be included within the range of\nmeaning. The only difference between the two positions is about which\naspect, the individual or the class property, is denoted first, and\nwhich is understood subsequently. This early debate indicates\nphilosophical positions that get expanded and fully argued in the\ntraditions of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nand the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas.\n\nThe early commentators on P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar from the late\nMauryan and post-Mauryan periods, K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali (200\u2013100 bce), display\na significant reorganization of Brahmanical views in the face of\nopposition from Jains and Buddhists. For K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali, the Sanskrit language at large is sacred like the\nVedas. The intelligent use of Sanskrit, backed by the explicit\nunderstanding of its grammar, leads to prosperity here and in the next\nworld, as do the Vedas. K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali admit\nthat vernaculars as well as Sanskrit could do the function of\ncommunicating meaning. However, only the usage of Sanskrit produces\nreligious merit. This is an indirect criticism of the Jains and the\nBuddhists, who used vernacular languages for the propagation of their\nfaiths. The grammarians did not accept the religious value of the\nvernaculars. The vernacular languages, along with the incorrect uses\nof Sanskrit, are all lumped together by the Sanskrit grammarians under\nthe derogatory terms apa\u015babda and\napabhra\u1e43\u015ba, both of which suggest a view that the\nvernaculars are degenerate or \u201cfallen\u201d forms of the divine\nlanguage, i.e., Sanskrit. K\u0101ty\u0101yana says: \u201cWhile the\nrelationship between words and meanings is established on the basis of\nthe usage of specific words to denote specific meanings in the\ncommunity of speakers, the science of grammar only makes a regulation\nconcerning the religious merit produced by the linguistic usage, as is\ncommonly done in worldly matters and in Vedic rituals\u201d (first\nV\u0101rttika on the\nA\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b). K\u0101ty\u0101yana\nrefers to these \u201cdegenerate\u201d vernacular usages as being\ncaused by the inability of the low-class speakers to speak proper\nSanskrit. The grammarians tell the story of demons that used improper\ndegenerate usages during their ritual and hence were defeated.\n\nThe relationship between Sanskrit words and their meanings is said to\nbe established (siddha) and taken as given by the\ngrammarians. Pata\u00f1jali understands this statement of\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana to mean that the relationship between Sanskrit\nwords and their meanings is eternal (nitya), not created\n(k\u0101rya) by anyone. Since this eternal relationship,\naccording to these grammarians, exists only for Sanskrit words and\ntheir meanings, one cannot accord the same status to the vernaculars,\nwhich are born of an inability on the part of their speakers to speak\nproper Sanskrit.\n\nWhile P\u0101\u1e47ini uses the term prak\u1e5bti to refer\nto the derivationally original state of a word or expression before\nchanges effected by grammatical operations are applied,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali use the term\nvik\u1e5bta to refer to the derivationally transformed\nsegment. However, change and identity are not compatible within more\nrigid metaphysical frameworks, and this becomes apparent in the\nfollowing discussion. In his V\u0101rttikas or comments on\nP\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar, K\u0101ty\u0101yana says that one could\nhave argued that an item partially transformed does not yet lose its\nidentity (V\u0101rttika 10 on P. 1.1.56). But such an\nacceptance would lead to non-eternality (anityatva) of\nlanguage (V\u0101rttika 11,\nMah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I, p. 136), and that is not\nacceptable. Pata\u00f1jali asserts that words in reality are eternal\n(nitya), and that means they must be absolutely free from\nchange or transformation and fixed in their nature. If words are truly\neternal, one cannot then say that a word was transformed and is yet\nthe same. This points to the emerging ideological shifts in\nphilosophical traditions, which make their headway into the tradition\nof grammar, and finally lead to the development of newer conceptions\nwithin the tradition of grammar and elsewhere.\n\nIn trying to figure out how the emerging doctrine of nityatva\n(\u201cpermanence\u201d, \u201cimmutability\u201d) of language\ncauses problems with the notion of transformation\n(vik\u0101ra) and how these problems are eventually answered\nby developing new concepts, we should note two issues, i.e., temporal\nfixity or flexibility of individual sounds, and the compatibility of\nthe notion of sequence of sounds, or utterance as a process stretched\nin time. From within the new paradigm of nityatva or\neternality of sounds, K\u0101ty\u0101yana concludes that the true\nsounds (var\u1e47a) are fixed in their nature in spite of\nthe difference of speed of delivery (V\u0101rttika 5 on P.\n1.1.70, Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I, p. 181). The speed of\ndelivery (v\u1e5btti) results from the slow or fast\nutterance of a speaker (vacana), though the true sounds are\npermanently fixed in their nature. Here, K\u0101ty\u0101yana broaches\na doctrine that is later developed further by Pata\u00f1jali, and\nmore fully by Bhart\u1e5bhari. It argues for a dual ontology. There\nare the fixed true sounds (var\u1e47a), and then there are\nthe uttered sounds (vacana, \u201cutterance\u201d). It is\nPata\u00f1jali who uses, for the first time as far as we know, the\nterm spho\u1e6da to refer to K\u0101ty\u0101yana\u2019s\n\u201ctrue sounds which are fixed\u201d (avasthit\u0101\nvar\u1e47\u0101\u1e25) and the term dhvani\n(\u201cuttered sounds\u201d). Pata\u00f1jali adds an important\ncomment to K\u0101ty\u0101yana\u2019s discussion. He says that the real\nsound (\u015babda) is thus the spho\u1e6da\n(\u201cthe sound as it initially breaks out into the open\u201d),\nand the quality [length or speed] of the sound is part of\ndhvani (\u201csound as it continues\u201d)\n(Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I, p. 181). The term\nspho\u1e6da refers to something like exploding or coming\ninto being in a bang. Thus it refers to the initial production or\nperception of sound. On the other hand, the stretching of that sound\nseems to refer to the dimension of continuation. Pata\u00f1jali\nmeans to say that it is the same sound, but it may remain audible for\ndifferent durations.\n\nThis raises the next problem that the grammarians must face: can a\nword be understood as a sequence or a collection of sounds?\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana says that one cannot have a sequence or a\ncollection of sounds, because the process of speech proceeds\nsound-by-sound, and that sounds perish as soon as they are uttered.\nThus, one cannot have two sounds co-existing at a given moment to\nrelate to each other. Since the sounds perish as soon as they are\nuttered, a sound cannot have another co-existent companion\n(V\u0101rttikas 9 and 10 on P. 1.4.109). K\u0101ty\u0101yana\npoints out all these difficulties, but it is Pata\u00f1jali who\noffers a solution to this philosophical dilemma. Pata\u00f1jali\nsuggests that one can pull together impressions of all the uttered\nsounds and then think of a sequence in this mentally constructed image\nof a word (Mah\u0101bha\u1e63ya, I, p. 356). Elsewhere,\nPata\u00f1jali says that a word is perceived through the auditory\norgan, discerned through one\u2019s intelligence, and brought into being\nthrough its utterance (Mah\u0101bha\u1e63ya, I, p. 18).\nWhile Pata\u00f1jali\u2019s solution overcomes the transitoriness of the\nuttered sounds, and the resulting impossibility of a sequence, there\nis no denial of sequentiality or perhaps of an imprint of\nsequentiality in the comprehended word, and there is indeed no claim\nto its absolutely unitary or partless character. Pata\u00f1jali\nmeans to provide a solution to the perception of sequentiality through\nhis ideas of a mental storage of comprehension. But at the same time,\nthis mental storage and the ability to view this mental image allows\none to overcome the difficulty of non-simultaneity and construct a\nword or a linguistic unit as a collection of perceived sounds or\nwords, as the case may be. K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali\nspecifically admit the notion of samud\u0101ya\n(\u201ccollection\u201d) of sounds to represent a word and a\ncollection of words to represent a phrase or a sentence\n(V\u0101rttika 7 on P. 2.2.29). Thus, while the ontology of\nphysical sounds does not permit their co-existence, their mental\nimages do allow it, and once they can be perceived as components of a\ncollection, one also recognizes the imprint of the sequence in which\nthey were perceived. Neither K\u0101ty\u0101yana nor Pata\u00f1jali\nexplicitly claim any higher ontological status to these word-images.\nHowever, the very acceptance of such word-images opens up numerous\nexplanatory possibilities.\n\nAlthough K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali argue that the\nnotion of change or transformation of parts of words was contradictory\nto the doctrine of nityatva (\u201cpermanence\u201d) of\nlanguage, they were not averse to the notion of substitution. The\nnotion of substitution was understood as a substitution, not of a part\nof a word by another part, but of a whole word by another word, and\nthis especially as a conceptual rather than an ontological\nreplacement. Thus, in going from \u201cbhavati\u201d to\n\u201cbhavatu\u201d, P\u0101\u1e47ini prescribes the\nchange of \u201ci\u201d of \u201cti\u201d to\n\u201cu\u201d (cf. P.3.4.86: \u201cer\nu\u1e25\u201d). Thus, \u201ci\u201d changes to\n\u201cu\u201d, leading to the change of\n\u201cti\u201d to \u201ctu\u201d, and this\nconsequently leads to the change of \u201cbhavati\u201d to\n\u201cbhavatu\u201d. For K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali, the above atomistic and transformational\nunderstanding of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s procedure goes contrary to the\ndoctrine of nityatva (\u201cpermanence\u201d) of words.\nTherefore, they suggest that it is actually the substitution of the\nwhole word \u201cbhavati\u201d by another whole word\n\u201cbhavatu\u201d, each of these two words being eternal\nin its own right. Additionally they assert that this is merely a\nnotional change and not an ontological change, i.e., a certain item is\nfound to occur, where one expected something else to occur. There is\nno change of an item x into an item y, nor does one\nremove the item x and place y in its place\n(V\u0101rttikas 12 and 14 on P. 1.1.56). This discussion\nseems to imply a sort of unitary character to the words, whether\nnotional or otherwise, and this eventually leads to a movement toward\na kind of\nakha\u1e47\u1e0da-pada-v\u0101da\n(\u201cthe doctrine of partless words\u201d) in the\nV\u0101kyapad\u012bya of Bhart\u1e5bhari. While one must\nadmit that the seeds for such a conception may be traced in these\ndiscussions in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya,\nPata\u00f1jali is actually not arguing so much against words having\nparts, as against the notion of change or transformation\n(Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya on P. 1.2.20, I, p. 75).\n\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali clearly view words as\ncollections of sounds. Besides using the term\n\u201csamud\u0101ya\u201d for such a collection, they also\nuse the word \u201cvar\u1e47asa\u1e43gh\u0101ta\u201d\n(\u201ccollection of sounds\u201d). They argue that words are built\nby putting together sounds, and that, while the words are meaningful,\nthe component sounds are not meaningful in themselves. The notion of a\nword as a collection (sa\u1e43gh\u0101ta) applies not only\nin the sense that it is a collection of sounds, but also in the sense\nthat complex formations are collections of smaller morphological\ncomponents.\n\nThis leads us to consider the philosophical developments in the\nthought of Bhart\u1e5bhari (400 ce), and\nespecially his departures from the conceptions seen in\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali. Apart from his significant\ncontribution toward an in depth philosophical understanding of issues\nof the structure and function of language, and issues of phonology,\nsemantics and syntax, Bhart\u1e5bhari is well known for his claim\nthat language constitutes the ultimate principle of reality\n(\u015babdabrahman). Both the signifier words and the\nsignified entities in the world are perceived to be a transformation\n(pari\u1e47\u0101ma) of the ultimate unified principle of\nlanguage.\n\nFor K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali, the level of\npadas (\u201cinflected words\u201d) is the basic level of\nlanguage for grammar. These words are freely combined by the users to\nform sentences or phrases. The words are not derived by\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali by abstracting them from\nsentences by using the method of anvaya-vyatireka\n(\u201cconcurrent occurrence and concurrent absence\u201d)\n(V\u0101rttika 9 on P. 1.2.45). On the other hand, they claim\nthat a grammarian first derives stems and affixes by applying the\nprocedure of abstraction to words, and then in turn puts these stems\nand affixes through the grammatical process of derivation\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) to build the words. Here,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali do make a distinction between\nthe levels of actual usage (vacana) and technical grammatical\nanalysis and derivation. While full-fledged words (pada)\noccur at the level of usage, their abstracted morphological components\ndo not occur by themselves at that level. However, they do not seem to\nsuggest that the stems, roots, and affixes are purely imagined\n(kalpita).\n\nBhart\u1e5bhari has substantially moved beyond K\u0101ty\u0101yana\nand Pata\u00f1jali. For him, the linguistically given entity is a\nsentence. Everything below the level of sentence is derived through a\nmethod of abstraction referred to by the term\nanvaya-vyatireka or apoddh\u0101ra.\nAdditionally, for Bhart\u1e5bhari, elements abstracted through this\nprocedure have no reality of any kind. They are kalpita\n(\u201cimagined\u201d) (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, III, 14,\n75\u201376). Such abstracted items have instructional value for those\nwho do not yet have any intuitive insight into the true nature of\nspeech (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, II. 238). The true speech\nunit, the sentence, is an undivided singularity and so is its meaning\nwhich is comprehended in an instantaneous cognitive flash\n(pratibh\u0101), rather than through a deliberative and/or\nsequential process. Consider the following verse of the\nV\u0101kyapad\u012bya (II.10):\n\nJust as stems, affixes etc. are abstracted from a given word, so the\nabstraction of words from a sentence is justified.\n\n\nHere, the clause introduced by \u201cjust as\u201d refers to the\nolder more widely prevalent view seen in the\nMah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya. With the word \u201cso,\u201d\nBhart\u1e5bhari is proposing an analogical extension of the procedure\nof abstraction (apoddh\u0101ra) to the level of a\nsentence.\n\nWithout mentioning Pata\u00f1jali or K\u0101ty\u0101yana by name,\nBhart\u1e5bhari seems to critique their view that the meaning of a\nsentence, consisting of the interrelations between the meanings of\nindividual words, is essentially not derived from the constituent\nwords themselves, but from the whole sentence as a collection of\nwords. The constituent words convey their meaning first, but their\ninterrelations are not communicated by the words themselves, but by\nthe whole sentence as a unit. This view of K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali is criticized by Bhart\u1e5bhari\n(V\u0101kyapad\u012bya II.15\u201316, 41\u201342). It is\nclear that Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s ideas do not agree with the views\nexpressed by K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali, and that the\nviews of these two earlier grammarians are much closer, though not\nidentical, with the views later maintained by the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas. For\nBhart\u1e5bhari, the sentence as a single partless unit conveys its\nentire unitary meaning in a flash, and this unitary meaning as well as\nthe unitary sentence are subsequently analyzed by grammarians into\ntheir assumed or imagined constituents.\n\nFinally, we should note that Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s views on the unitary\ncharacter of a sentence and its meaning were found to be generally\nunacceptable by the schools of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nand Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, as well as by\nthe later grammarian-philosophers like\nKau\u1e47\u1e0dabha\u1e6d\u1e6da and\nN\u0101ge\u015babha\u1e6d\u1e6da. Their discussion of the\ncomprehension of sentence-meaning is not couched in terms of\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s instantaneous flash of intuition\n(pratibh\u0101), but in terms of the conditions of\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101 (\u201cmutual\nexpectancy\u201d), yogyat\u0101\n(\u201ccompatibility)\u201d, and \u0101satti\n(\u201ccontiguity of words\u201d). In this sense, the later\ngrammarian-philosophers are somewhat closer to the spirit of\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali.\n",
