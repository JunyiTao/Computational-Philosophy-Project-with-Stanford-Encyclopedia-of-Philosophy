    "main_text": "Varieties of Anarchism || Black, Indigenous, and Decolonizing Anarchism\n1.5 Black, Indigenous, and Decolonizing Anarchism\n\nAs mentioned above, among the varieties of applied anarchism we find\nanarchism associated with various liberation movements and critiques\nof white supremacy, Eurocentrism, and colonialism. This could be\nconnected with feminist anarchism, women\u2019s liberation movements,\nand an anarchist critique of patriarchy. We\u2019ll focus here on the\nanarchist critique found in Black and indigenous liberation movements.\nGandhi\u2019s movement in India could be included here (as discussed\nbelow). \n\nOne focal point here is a claim about anarchist characteristics\nthought to be found in the social structures of indigenous peoples.\nSometimes this is a romantic projection of anti-civilizational\nanarchists such as John Zerzan, who echoes Rousseau\u2019s naive and\nill-informed ideal of the \u201cnoble savage.\u201d One must be careful to avoid\nessentializing claims made about indigenous cultures and political\nsocieties. The Inca and the Aztec empires were obviously not utopian\nanarchist collectives. Nonetheless, scholars of indigeneity affirm the\nanarchist critique of dominant hegemonies as part of the effort of\nliberation that would allow indigenous people a degree of\nself-determination (see Johnson and Ferguson 2019).\n\nBlack and indigenous anarchisms provide a radical critique, which\nholds that the global history of genocide, slavery, colonization, and\nexploitation rest upon the assumption of white supremacy. White\nsupremacy is thus understood, from this point of view, as a\npresupposition of statism, centralization, hierarchy, and authority.\nThe anarchist critique of white supremacy is thus linked to a critique\nof social and political systems that evolved out of the history of\nslavery and native genocide to include apartheid, inequality,\ncaste/racial hierarchies, and other forms of structural racism. Some\ndefenders of Black anarchism go so far as to suggest that when\n\u201cBlackness\u201d is defined in opposition to structures of white supremacy,\nthere is a kind of anarchism woven into the concept. Anderson and\nSamudzi write, \n\n\nWhile bound to the laws of the land, Black America can be understood\nas an extra-state entity because of Black exclusion from the liberal\nsocial contract. Due to this extra-state location, Blackness is, in so\nmany ways, anarchistic. (Anderson and Samudzi 2017: no page\nnumbers)\n\n\nThis implies that the experience of Black people unfolds in a social\nand political world that its defined by its exclusion from power. A\nsimilar implication holds for indigenous people, who have been\nsubjugated and dominated by colonial power. Liberation movements thus\nspring from a social experience that is in a sense anarchic (i.e.,\ndeveloped in exclusion from and opposition to structures of power).\nIt is not surprising, then, that some liberatory activists espouse and\naffirm anarchism. The American activist Lorenzo Kom\u2019boa Ervin,\nfor example, affirms anarchism in pursuit of Black liberation (Ervin\n1997 [2016]). He explains that Black anarchism is different from what\nhe describes as the more authoritarian hierarchy of the Black Panther\nparty. He also argues against the authoritarian structure of\nreligiously oriented Black liberation movements, such as that led by\nMartin Luther King, Jr. \n\nA significant issue in Black and indigenous anarchisms is the effort\nto decolonize anarchism itself. Many of the key figures in the\nanarchist tradition are white, male, and European. The concerns of\nanarchists such as Kropotkin or Bakunin may be different from the\nconcerns of African Americans or from the concerns of indigenous\npeople in Latin America or elsewhere around the globe. One solution to\nthis problem is to retrieve forgotten voices from within the\ntradition. In this regard, we might consider Lucy Parsons (also known\nas Lucy Gonzalez), a former slave who espoused anarchism. Parsons\nexplained that she affirmed anarchism because the political status quo\nproduced nothing but misery and starvation for the masses of humanity.\nTo resolve this an anarchist revolution was needed. Parsons said,\n\n\nMost anarchists believe the coming change can only come through a\nrevolution, because the possessing class will not allow a peaceful\nchange to take place; still we are willing to work for peace at any\nprice, except at the price of liberty. (Parsons 1905 [2010])\n\n",
