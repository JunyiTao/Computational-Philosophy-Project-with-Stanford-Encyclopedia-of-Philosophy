    "main_text": "Means and Ends || Practical Judgment is Transformative\n3.3 Practical Judgment is Transformative\n\nPractical reasoning does not merely generate new appraisals; it\ntransforms our prizings. This is the point of Dewey\u2019s theory of\ncriticism and taste. Judgments of the merits of prizings feed back\nonto our primitive prizings and transform them. They not only make\nthese prizings more articulate (a union of prizing and appraising); in\nmaking us more vividly aware of the features of the object that we\nprize, they alter the directions of our prizings (VEK 4\u20139). As a\nresult of deliberation, the man who needs the suit comes to prize\nstyle, say, more than he did before, and cheapness less. Nor is this\npossibility of transformation limited to what are conventionally\nunderstood to be \u201cinstrumental\u201d values. Whether a quality\nsuch as style is \u201cintrinsic\u201d or \u201cinstrumental\u201d\nis not built into the nature of the quality itself, but a function of\nhow it is regarded by the individual at the time. Instruments may be\nprized in themselves (as when we admire a particularly finely balanced\ntool). More importantly, stylishness may immediately attract \u2014\nbe immediately prized \u2014 but it also has its uses in impressing\nsome prospective employers, and its unintended consequence of turning\noff others (who may think it important in an employee not to show\noff).\n",
