Auditory Verbal Hallucinations and Inserted Thoughts\n\nInner speech features prominently in philosophical and cognitive\nscientific discussions of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and\nthought insertion. Both are common symptoms of schizophrenia but can\noccur in other contexts (e.g., brain injury, drug use) as well. AVHs\nare hallucinatory experiences of another\u2019s speech, while thought\ninsertion is understood either as a non-veridical experience of having\nsomeone else\u2019s thoughts in one\u2019s mind (Wing et al. 1990),\nor simply as the delusional belief that someone else\u2019s thoughts\nare in one\u2019s mind (Andreasen 1984). Two central questions\nexplored by theorists are, first, whether (abnormal) inner speech is\nindeed the basis of AVHs or thought insertion, and, second, what might\nlead an episode of inner speech to be experienced as an AVH or\ninserted thought.\n\nOn the first question, an initially plausible approach to AVHs is to\nhold that they are more a matter of hallucinatory speech\nperception than of (unwitting) speech production, and thus\nnot well conceived as episodes of inner speech. Wu (2012) and Cho\n& Wu (2013, 2014) advance a theory of this kind, holding that AVHs\nresult from the spontaneous activation of speech perception areas in\nthe brain. On their account, inner speech\u2014and, in particular,\nthe neural regions implicated in speech production\u2014are not\nimplicated in AVHs. Despite the attractive simplicity of this account,\nmost researchers have pursued options that explicitly involve inner\nspeech, for several reasons. First, in formal surveys, patients often\nreport that the phenomenological characteristics of their AVHs are\ndifferent from those of hearing speech, insofar as their AVHs are not\nas subjectively \u201cloud\u201d as cases of hearing speech, are not\nequally rich in sensory features, and do not always seem to emanate\nfrom outside the head (Stephens & Graham 2000; Hoffman et al.\n2008; Laroi et al. 2012; Nayani & David 1996; Stephane 2019). It\nappears that an explanation of the seemingly \u201calien\u201d\nnature of these episodes, as well as of thought insertion, will\nrequire some other apparatus than an appeal to perception-like\nphenomenology. Given the need for such an alternative, one may hope to\nextend it also to cases of AVHs that are reported as having rich,\nperception-like phenomenological features (Langland-Hassan 2008;\nMoseley & Wilkinson 2014).\n\nSecond, neuroimaging has shown activation in both language perception\nand language production areas when patients are experiencing\nAVHs (Allen, Aleman, & Mcguire 2007; Allen, Modinos, et al. 2012;\nBohlken, Hugdahl, & Sommer 2017). Here as in other areas of the\nstudy of inner speech, it is important to recognize that the neural\nregions underlying speech production (such as Broca\u2019s area, in\nthe left inferior frontal gyrus) are distinct from those governing\nspeech perception (such as Wernicke\u2019s area, in the superior\ntemporal gyrus). This is why damage to one area but not the other (as\nin some cases of stroke) can result in markedly different language\nimpairments. The fact that the mechanisms governing speech production\nand perception are dissociable in these ways provides an important\nmeans for assessing whether AVHs are best viewed as productive or\nperceptual (or both) in nature.\n\nNevertheless, those who see abnormal inner speech episodes as the\nbasis for AVHs or thought insertion face a difficult task in\nexplaining what would lead a person to not identify their own inner\nspeech as their own, or to not feel in control of their own inner\nspeech. Some have offered content-based explanations, where it is some\nfeature of the semantic content of the inner speech that leads a\nperson to disown it. For instance, Stephens and Graham (2000) argue\nthat a patient may disown inner speech episodes with contents that are\n\u201cintentionally inexplicable\u201d, in the sense that they are\nnot easily accommodated within a coherent self-narrative (see also\nRoessler (2013), Sollberger (2014), Bortolotti & Broome (2009),\nand Fern\u00e1ndez (2010) on the idea that AVHs or inserted thoughts\nare episodes with contents the patient is unwilling to endorse).\nChallenges for this approach are patient reports of voices that are\nhelpful or encouraging. As the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler notes\nin early work on people with schizophrenia, \u201cbesides their\npersecutors, the patients often hear the voice of some\nprotector\u201d, and, occasionally, the hallucinatory voices\n\u201crepresent sound criticism of the [the patient\u2019s]\ndelusional thoughts and pathological drives\u201d (1911 [1950:\n98]).\n\nA popular alternative approach\u2014sometimes known as the\n\u201ccomparator\u201d or \u201csensory feedback\u201d\napproach\u2014builds on work in cognitive neuroscience concerning the\nmechanisms by which bodily movements are determined to be one\u2019s\nown (Feinberg 1978; Frith 1992; Miall et al. 1993; Wolpert, Miall\n& Kawato 1998). The basic idea behind these approaches is that,\nbelow the level of consciousness, the brain is continually generating\npredictions about the likely sensory consequences of planned actions,\nwhich are then compared with actual sensory feedback. When there is a\nmismatch between the prediction and sensory feedback, one may have the\nphenomenological sense of not being in control of one\u2019s actions\n(Frith 2012). A number of authors have proposed that the generation of\nboth inner and outer speech may be attended by the same kind of\nprediction and comparison mechanisms, and that the malfunctioning of\nthese mechanisms could lead to one\u2019s own inner speech seeming\nnot to be in one\u2019s control (Blakemore, Smith, et al. 2000;\nCampbell 1999; Langland-Hassan 2016; Proust 2006). These proposals\nderive some support from the fact that people with schizophrenia have\nbeen shown to have broader deficits in automatically anticipating and\nadjusting for the sensory consequences of their own actions\n(Blakemore, Smith et al. 2000; Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith\n1998).\n\nNevertheless, the comparator approach to AVHs and thought insertion\nhas come in for criticism on several grounds (Synofzik, Vosgerau &\nNewen 2008; Vicente 2014; Vosgerau & Newen 2007). One complaint\nhas been that the lack of sensory features associated with inserted\nthoughts, in particular, makes sensory-feedback approaches ill-suited\nto their explanation (Vosgerau & Newen 2007). In response, some\ndefenders have shifted to pitching the thesis in terms of predictive\nprocessing models of perception and action (Gerrans 2015; Swiney 2018;\nSwiney & Sousa 2014; Wilkinson 2014; Wilkinson & Fernyhough\n2017), while others have developed other alternatives (Langland-Hassan\nforthcoming). The matter of how best to characterize the phenomenology\nand underlying etiology of AVHs and thought insertion\u2014and the\nrelation of each to inner speech\u2014together with the precise\nrelationship between predictive processing models and the comparator\napproach, remain active areas of research. See Wilkinson &\nAlderson-Day (2016) for an introduction to an edited special-issue on\nthe topic oriented at philosophers; see L\u00f3pez-Silva &\nMcClelland (forthcoming) for a philosophically-oriented anthology on\nthought insertion.
