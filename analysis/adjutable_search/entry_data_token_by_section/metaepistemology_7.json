    "main_text": "Methodology in epistemology || Methodism and particularism\n3.1 Methodism and particularism\n\nThe (very broad) characterization of epistemology as the \u201ctheory\nof knowledge\u201d\u2014even if strictly speaking an oversimplified\npicture\u2014is often associated with two different questions about\nknowledge:\n\nWhat do we know?\nHow do we know?\n\n\nThe answer to the first might include both specific knowledge (i.e.,\nyour knowledge that you have a hand) or types of\nknowledge\u2014viz., we have knowledge of mathematics, knowledge of\nthe past, knowledge of the qualitative character of our experiences,\netc. An answer to the second kind of question would look very\ndifferent. An answer to the second would give us criteria (or canons,\nmethods, principles, or the like) that would explain how we know\nwhatever it is that we do know (Sosa 1980: 4; cf., Cassam (2007) for a\nslightly different \u201chow possible\u201d reading of this second\nquestion).\n\nBecause these are different questions of interest\u2014seeking\ndifferent kinds of answers\u2014epistemologists have long debated\nwhich to take up first in epistemological theorizing. This\nmethodological question is vexed, because it may seem as though we\ncannot begin to answer the first question without already having an\nanswer to the second (viz., we can\u2019t identify instances of\nknowledge absent knowledge of general criteria for identifying those\ninstances), but we can\u2019t know what the criteria are without\nreference to particular cases in connection with which we could then\nidentify such criteria. According to Roderick Chisholm, the problem of\nresolving this prima facie tension\u2014the \u201cProblem\nof the Criterion\u201d\u2014constitutes\n\n\none of the most important and one of the most difficult of all the\nproblems of philosophy. I am tempted to say that one has not begun to\nphilosophize until one has faced this problem and has recognized how\nunappealing, in the end, each possible solution is. (Chisholm 1973:\n12).\n\n\nThe canonical non-skeptical approaches to the problem are\nparticularism and methodism (for overviews, see\nFumerton 2008; Amico 1993; McCain 2014\n [Other Internet Resources];\n Cling 1994; Vahid 2005). The particularist strategy (e.g.,\nChisholm 1977) begins with the first question and on this basis then\nanswers the second question, albeit, in a way that would seem to\nassume ex ante the falsity of skepticism. The\nmethodist makes no such initial assumption that we have any\nknowledge at all (i.e., no assumption about what we know) and\ninstead first answers the more general question about what the\ncriteria are for knowing, and then only on this basis then (with\nreference to such criteria) answers question (i).\n\nThe analysis of knowledge from the middle 20th century\nonward (see Ichikawa & Steup 2012 [2018]) largely follows a\nparticularist strategy, in so far as, especially following Gettier\n(1963), candidate criteria for knowing are tested for adequacy against\nparadigmatic cases of knowledge as reference points (Shope 1983). Such\na strategy marks a shift from earlier influential strategies, such as\nby Descartes and Hume, both of whom took as a starting point\u2014and\nin a way that is in principle open to skepticism\u2014that\nonly the obvious and what is proved deductively on its basis can\npossibly be known (Sosa 1980: 4). Whereas a standard objection against\nthe particularist is that she begs the question against the skeptic,\nthe most standard objection against the methodist starting point is\nnot so easily captured. As Chisholm puts it, beginning (as the\nmethodist does) with a broad generalization would\n\n\nleave us completely in the dark so far as concerns what reasons he may\nhave for adopting this particular criterion rather than some other.\n(Chisholm 1973: 67)\n\n\nOn one way of reading the objection, starting with a broad\ngeneralization is objectionably arbitrary; however, the\nextent of the arbitrariness here would plausibly depend on whether the\nmethodist can adduce a reason in favor of her broad starting point\nwhich doesn\u2019t itself involve pointing to specific instances of\nknowledge (see, e.g., Amico 1988).\n\nThe particularism/methodism divide connects naturally to other wider\nissues of interest in epistemology. First, a strong methodist starting\npoint, such as the starting point from Descartes and Hume, implies a\nfoundationalist approach to the structure of justified belief and\nknowledge. That is, Descartes and Hume opt for foundationalism by\nway of taking the particular methodist starting point that they\ndo. Second, the particularism/methodism divide might well be such that\nother epistemological problems of interest are special cases\nof this problem. For example, James Van Cleve (1979) and Sosa (2009)\nboth regard the Cartesian Circle as closely connected with the Problem\nof the Criterion in this way. Third, while the Problem of the\nCriterion in epistemology is typically formulated in connection with\nthe project of analyzing knowledge, the philosophical\nproblems associated with methodism or particularism (and which might\nbe our proper starting point) apply, mutatis mutandis, to\nprojects in epistemology that investigate other epistemic phenomena of\ninterest, including, e.g., epistemic justification, understanding,\nintellectual virtues, and the like. And, as a point of philosophical\nmethod, the problem might also be appreciated as a philosophical\nproblem about philosophical method, one that extends beyond\nepistemology to other kinds of philosophical analyses (for discussion\nsee Fumerton 1995, 2008).\n",
