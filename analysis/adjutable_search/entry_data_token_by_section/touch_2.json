    "main_text": "Touch and the Other Senses\n3. Touch and the Other Senses\nIn addition to its own constituent systems, touch interacts with\nother modalities in interesting ways. This is important in the history\nof philosophy especially because the most discussed interaction, or\npotential interaction, concerned the connection between touch and\nvision. Both senses bring information about shape and size and\nlocation, but they seem to do so in very different ways. The central\nquestion has long been the nature and strength of these\ndifferences.\nThis question has received the most attention in large part because\nof Molyneux\u2019s famous letter to Locke (see the entry on\n Molyneux\u2019s problem).\n Molyneux asked whether whether a subject born blind\ncould, upon complete restoration of sight, tell a cube from a sphere\n(a difference learned through touch) using sight alone. This raises\nmany questions about the transferability and connection between the\nspatial representations made available in touch and vision. There are\nmany assumptions underlying Molyneux\u2019s question, which have long\nbeen investigated by philosophers and psychologists (Evans 1985;\nCampbell 1996; Hopkins 2005).\nIn addition, there has been considerable discussion of how touch\nand vision might differ in terms of their spatial features. Vision, it\nseems, provides a rich felt awareness of objects in a spatial\nfield\u2013an area where there are potential objects but where none\ncurrently reside (that is, we seem in vision to be able to see empty\nspace). Touch, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t seem to present\nfeatures in this way. Instead, like audition, touch seems only to\nbring awareness of individual objects that each seem to occupy a\nspecific location.\nThe relation between touch and agency reveals more interesting\nareas for further investigation. In particular, it seems plausible\nthat the sense of touch has a closer connection to our agential\nactions. This is partially a result of the fact that touch seems to\nrequire active exploratory movements, and these movements are often\nguided and voluntary. Given these close\nconnections, it is probably not surprising that touch has such a close\nconnection to agency.  One could even use of this close connection\nbetween touch and agency to address epistemological problem of\nperception (see Smith (2002), and the entry on the\n problem of perception). When\nwe press against a solid object, the resistance to our agential act of\npressing gives our experience a more solid epistemic foundation than\nwhat we experience through the other sensory modalities. Only in touch do we\nseem to come into direct contact with reality, a reality that actively\nresists our voluntary actions.\nPhilosophers have also been interested in the relation between\ntouch and other sensory modalities. It seems plausible to think that\ntouch, unlike vision, does not have a full, 3-dimensional sensible\nfield in external space. Instead, touch seems confined to the limits\nof the body, and so the tangible field is, unlike in the other\nmodalities, defined by the limits and extent of the surface of the\nbody. Fardo et al (2018) offer a plausible empirical model for how this limited surface could generate rich spatial awareness. This supposed difference in the nature of their spatial awareness marks a clear structural difference between touch and\nvision, even when they represent the same sets of objective\nfeatures. Similarly, one could claim that touch also differs from the\nother senses in always involving bodily awareness\n(O\u2019Shaughnessy 1989). Externally\u2013directed touch awareness\non such a view would only be made possible against a background of\nbodily awareness. This sort of view has been labeled \u201cthe\ntemplate view\u201d (Scott 2001).\n",
