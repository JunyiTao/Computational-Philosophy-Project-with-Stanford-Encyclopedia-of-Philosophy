    "main_text": "Transcendental Semiotics: The Overturning of the Traditional Objectivist Concept of the Sign\n5. Transcendental Semiotics: The Overturning of the Traditional Objectivist Concept of the Sign\n\nHumboldt\u2019s approach differs radically from that of his predecessors.\n\u201cThe Nature of thinking consists in reflecting\u201d, he states\nin thesis 1, \u201cthat is, in the act by which the thinking subject\ndifferentiates itself from its thought\u201d (im Unterscheiden\ndes Denkenden vom Gedachten). This basic fact that every person\ncan easily verify by performing such an act is the starting point of\nHumboldt\u2019s deliberations. Now, to reflect we must in our mind\narrest the continuous flow of impressions in order to concentrate on\nsomething, comprehend this something as a separate \u201cunit\u201d\n(Einheit), and set it as an object over against our thinking\nactivity (thesis 2). As a next step, the mind can now proceed to\ncompare several of these \u201cunits\u201d, divide and combine them\nin different ways. In drawing the conclusion (thesis 4) from this\nstate of affairs, Humboldt lays the ground for a radically new notion\nof the sign that anticipates (and points beyond) Saussure\u2019s definition\ngiven in his Cours de Linguistique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nThinking consists for Humboldt\n\n\nin segmenting its own process, thereby forming whole units out of\ncertain portions of its activity, and in setting these formations\nseparately in opposition to one another, collectively, however, as\nobjects, in opposition to the thinking subject.\n\n\nIn other words, in this process of segmentation not only are different\nobjects are created, but with it the very subject of this thinking\nactivity constitutes itself. Up to this point we seem to have been\nmoving very much along the lines of Fichte\u2019s\nWissenschaftslehre\u2014the \u201cI\u201d positing itself\nin the act of thinking\u2014but in thesis 5, Humboldt\u2019s argumentation\ntakes a sudden Kantian turn:\n\n\nNo thinking, not even the purest, can occur without the aid from the\ngeneral forms of our sensibility (allgemeinen Formen unsrer\nSinnlichkeit); only through them can it be apprehended and, as it\nwere, arrested.\n\n\nWhat Humboldt is saying, then, is that the mental acts he has\ndescribed would not have been possible without assistance from the\ngeneral forms of our sensibility. But how precisely do they make these\nacts possible? Thesis 6 offers an unexpectedly suspenseful answer that\nbuilds up to its culmination in the very last word which is:\n\u201clanguage\u201d:\n\n\nThe sensory designations of those units, into which certain portions\nof our thinking are united, in order to be opposed as parts to other\nparts of a greater whole as objects to the subjects, is called in the\nbroadest sense of the word: language (Sprache).\n\n\nWhat Humboldt describes here is a dual process of segmentation: that\nof the mental stream of impressions and a corresponding one of sensory\norder, exactly what linguists today refer to as the \u201cprinciple\nof double articulation\u201d (Martinet 1963: 22f). Through reflection\nwe single out \u201ccertain portions\u201d from the unending and\namorphous flow of impressions and mental images while at the same time\nimposing an order upon them. This imposition of order is the work of\nthe sensory medium of language: word sounds function as structured\nunits (Einheiten) through which we discern and secure the\nmental units in the flow of impressions and images. Human speech,\ntherefore, is no longer seen by Humboldt as applying and manipulating\na fixed system of arbitrary signs as was assumed by both rationalists\nand empiricists, but consists rather of the operation of joining\ntogether these two different sets of orders: that of the articulated\nsound, the signifier, and that of the \u201cthought\u201d or\nsignified. Over a century later Saussure in his Cours de\nLinguistique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale would define language and the\nlinguistic sign with almost the same words. What constituted language,\naccording to Saussure, was\n\n\nthe somehow mysterious fact that the thought-sound implies the\ndivisions which are the ultimate units of linguistics. Sound and\nthought can be combined only by means of these units. (1916/1968:\n252\u20133)\n\n\nIt is Humboldt who deserves the credit for having first discovered the\ntriadic nature of the linguistic sign: Signification (speaking) is\ndefined by him as the synthesis (Saussure\u2019s combination) of\nsound and idea\u2014Ton and Vorstellung.\n",
