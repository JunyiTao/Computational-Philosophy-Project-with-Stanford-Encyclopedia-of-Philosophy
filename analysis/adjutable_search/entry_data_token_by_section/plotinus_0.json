    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\n Owing to the unusually fulsome biography by Plotinus\u2019 disciple\nPorphyry, we know more about Plotinus\u2019 life than we do about most\nancient philosophers\u2019.  The main facts are these.\n\n Plotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt in 204 or 205 C.E.  When he was\n28, a growing interest in philosophy led him to the feet of one\nAmmonius Saccas in Alexandria.  After ten or eleven years with this\nobscure though evidently dominating figure, Plotinus was moved to\nstudy Persian and Indian philosophy.  In order to do so, he attached\nhimself to the military expedition of Emperor Gordian III to Persia in\n243.  The expedition was aborted when Gordian was assassinated by his\ntroops.  Plotinus thereupon seems to have abandoned his plans, making\nhis way to Rome in 245.  There he remained until his death in 270 or\n271.\n\n Porphyry informs us that during the first ten years of his time in\nRome, Plotinus lectured exclusively on the philosophy of Ammonius.\nDuring this time he also wrote nothing.  Porphyry tells us that when\nhe himself arrived in Rome in 263, the first 21 of Plotinus\u2019 treatises\nhad already been written.  The remainder of the 54 treatises\nconstituting his Enneads were written in the last seven or\neight years of his life.\n\n Porphyry\u2019s biography reveals a man at once otherworldly and deeply\npractical.  The former is hardly surprising in a philosopher but the\nlatter deserves to be noted and is impressively indicated by the fact\nthat a number of Plotinus\u2019 acquaintances appointed him as guardian to\ntheir children when they died.\n\n Plotinus\u2019 writings were edited by Porphyry (there was perhaps another\nedition by Plotinus\u2019 physician, Eustochius, though all traces of it\nare lost).  It is to Porphyry that we owe the somewhat artificial\ndivision of the writings into six groups of nine (hence the name\nEnneads from the Greek word for \u2018nine\u2019).  In fact,\nthere are somewhat fewer than 54 (Porphyry artificially divided some\nof them into separately numbered \u2018treatises\u2019), and the\nactual number of these is of no significance.  The arrangement of the\ntreatises is also owing to Porphyry and does evince an ordering\nprinciple.  Ennead I contains, roughly, ethical discussions;\nEnneads II\u2013III contain discussions of natural philosophy and\ncosmology (though III 4, 5, 7, 8 do not fit into this rubric so\neasily); Ennead IV is devoted to matters of psychology;\nEnnead V, to epistemological matters, especially the intellect;\nand Ennead VI, to numbers, being in general, and the One above\nintellect, the first principle of all.  It is to be emphasized that\nthe ordering is Porphyry\u2019s.  The actual chronological ordering, which\nPorphyry also provides for us, does not correspond at all to the\nordering in the edition.  For example, Ennead I 1 is the\n53rd treatise chronologically, one of the last things\nPlotinus wrote.\n\n These works vary in size from a couple of pages to over a hundred.\nThey seem to be occasional writings in the sense that they constitute\nwritten responses by Plotinus to questions and problems raised in his\nregular seminars.  Sometimes these questions and problems guide the\nentire discussion, so that it is sometimes difficult to tell when\nPlotinus is writing in his own voice or expressing the views of\nsomeone else.  Typically, Plotinus would at his seminars have read out\npassages from Platonic or Aristotelian commentators, it being assumed\nthat the members of the seminar were already familiar with the primary\ntexts.  Then a discussion of the text along with the problems it\nraised occurred.\n\n One must not suppose that the study of Aristotle at these seminars\nbelonged to a separate \u2018course\u2019 on the great successor of\nPlato.  After Plotinus, in fact Aristotle was studied on his own as\npreparation for studying Plato.  But with Plotinus, Aristotle, it\nseems, was assumed to be himself one of the most effective expositors\nof Plato.  Studying both Aristotle\u2019s own philosophy as explained by\ncommentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd \u2013\nearly 3rd c. C.E.) and his explicit objections to Plato was\na powerful aid in understanding the master\u2019s philosophy.  In part,\nthis was owing to the fact that Aristotle was assumed to know Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy at first hand and to have recorded it, including Plato\u2019s\n\u2018unwritten teachings\u2019.  In addition, later Greek\nhistorians of philosophy tell us that Plotinus\u2019 teacher, Ammonius\nSaccas, was among those Platonists who assumed that in some sense\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy was in harmony with Platonism.  This harmony\ndid not preclude disagreements between Aristotle and Plato.  Nor did\nit serve to prevent misunderstandings of Platonism on Aristotle\u2019s\npart.  Nevertheless, Plotinus\u2019 wholesale adoption of many Aristotelian\narguments and distinctions will seem less puzzling when we realize\nthat he took these both as compatible with Platonism and as useful for\narticulating the Platonic position, especially in areas in which Plato\nwas himself not explicit.\n",
