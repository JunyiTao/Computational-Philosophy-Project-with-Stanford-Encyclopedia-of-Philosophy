Beauty, to\nreiterate, is what inspires love and desire, and thereby connects all\nlevels of the universe into an interlocking and organic relationship.\nThe result is that everything, both sensual and intelligible, has the\npotential to image and reflect God\u2019s beauty.\n\n\nJudah\u2019s cosmology is a case in point. In the\nDialoghi he presents two distinct accounts of the origin of\nthe universe. This issue\u2014viz., was the universe\ncreated or is it eternal\u2014was one of the touchstones in the\ndebate not only between philosophers and non-philosophers, but also\namong philosophers. At stake in these debates was God\u2019s\nomnipotence and omniscience: If the world was created, then clearly God\nis transcendent to the world as both its Creator and Sustainer; if not,\nthen God\u2019s power to act is potentially curtailed by another\nprinciple\u2019s eternality.  In his discussion of these\nmatters, Judah adopts two models: one based on Islamicate Neoplatonism\nand the other on the Plotinian triad.\n\n\nAccording to the first model, Judah argues\u2014citing Ghazali,\nAvicenna and Maimonides\u2014that God in His complete simplicity and\n\u201cby the love of His infinite beauty produces out of Himself alone\nthe first intelligence and mover of the first heaven\u201d (con\nl\u2019amore de la sua immense bellezza immediate da s\u00e9 sola la\nprima intelligenzia movtrice del primo cielo \n produce).[25]  \n The first\nintelligence, in turn, contemplates (1) the beauty of its cause to\nproduce the second intellect, and (2) its own beauty to produce the\nfirst heavenly sphere. This theory of emanation, based on the\nlove of\n beauty,[26]\n pervades the entire universe (both supra- and sub-lunar). The\nActive Intellect, the lowest of the ten heavenly intellects and\nassociated with the sphere of the moon, becomes the intellect of the\ncorporeal world. By contemplating its own beauty it produces the\nforms found in this world, and in contemplating the beauty of its\ncause, it produces human intellects. Following this, Judah offers\na Plotinian account based on a celestial\n triad.[27] \n He now distinguishes between\nthree types of beauty that pervade the cosmos. The first is God\nqua the Source of beauty (l\u2019attore di\nbellezza), the second is beauty itself (bellezza; i.e.,\nintelligible beauty), and the third is the physical universe produced\nby this idea in the intellect of God (il participante di\n bellezza).[28]\n\n\nJudah subsequently uses the latter model, combined with kabbalistic\nembellishment, to interpret the first creation account in Genesis,\nwhere the physical world is now described as the offspring between\nGod, the male principle, and intelligible beauty, now personified as a\n female.[29]\n Corporeal\nbeauty, according to this model, becomes the primogeniture of\nGod\u2019s love for His female consort, wisdom. Since this\nphysical world is intimately connected to God, it cannot be\nnegated. Rather, this world becomes necessary, and this is a\nleitmotiv that runs throughout the work, for humans to make physical\nbeauty \u201cspiritual in our\n intellect.\u201d[30] \n One must, in other words,\norientate oneself towards sensible beauty in such a manner that one\nreverses the ontological chain.\n",
