Acts\nare transactional: we act with and on things, in\ncontexts, amidst conditions. Acts are fundamental to understanding\nbehavior because they are selective. By directing movement\nand organizing situations, they manifest interest. This\ncombination\u2014of selectivity and interest\u2014make activities\nmeaningful. For example, our ancestors acted selectively regarding how\nto satisfy instinctive hunger; such selectivity created the conditions\nfor a more elaborate interest in the taste of food, and, much\nlater, in dining customs and cuisine.\n\nDrawing upon James\u2019 and Peirce\u2019s uses of\n\u201chabit\u201d, Dewey integrates habit deeply into his\nphilosophy. Habit helps explain various dimensions of human experience\n(biological, ethical, political, and aesthetic) as manifested in\ncomplex and social behaviors\u2014walking, talking, cooking,\n conversing.[7]\n Habits are not simple; they are composed of acts. Acts unfold in\ntime, beginning with instinct borne of need and muddling toward\nreintegration and satisfaction. To become a habit, an act-series must\npossess gradual and cumulative change; such change concresces as one\nact leads to the next. When there is a cumulative linking of acts\nwhich structure experience, there is \u201chabit\u201d. Habit, Dewey\nwrote, \u201cis an acquired predisposition to ways or modes\nof response, not to particular acts\u201d (HNC, MW14: 32).\nThese ways are typically shaped by both past experience as an\nindividual and especially through social and linguistic interactions;\nwe call habits shared by groups \u201ccustoms\u201d.\n\nWhile habits may become routines, Dewey argued against the assumption\nthat they were therefore automatic or insulated from conscious\nintervention. They cannot be automatic, because new situations vary,\nand the same exact acts never repeat. Thus, unlike machine routines,\norganic habits remain plastic, changeable. My habitual eating of\nsweets is subject to contingency (a sharp toothache) and modification\n(restraint, substitution); frequently, conscious reflection on an\nexisting habit is the first stage of habit revision.\n\nHabits were also envisioned as dormant powers, waiting to be invoked.\nDewey argued that habits are, instead, \u201cenergetic and dominating\nways of acting\u201d determining what we do and are: \u201cAll\nhabits are demands for certain kinds of activity; and they constitute\nthe self\u201d (HNC, MW14: 22, 21). Dewey inveighed against\nthe notion that habits are like individual possessions. Rather, habits\nexist as transactions between organisms and environments; they are not\n\u201cinner forces\u201d but functions which make adaptation or\nreconstruction possible. \n\n\nHabits enter into the constitution of the situation; they are\nin and of it, not, so far as it is concerned, something outside of it.\n(\u201cBrief Studies in Realism\u201d, MW6: 120) \n\n\nBecause the situation is cultural as well as bio-physical, habits are\nineliminably social. So-called \u201cindividual\u201d habits emerge\nwithin the social world of friends, family, home, work, media, etc.\nThis means that effecting a change of habits does not require a\nmagical act of sheer willpower, but rather intelligent inquiry into\nrelevant conditions (psychological, sociological, economic, etc.).\n",
