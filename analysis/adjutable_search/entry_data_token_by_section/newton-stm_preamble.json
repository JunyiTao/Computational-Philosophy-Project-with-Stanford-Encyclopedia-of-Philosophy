    "main_text": "\n\n\nIsaac Newton founded classical mechanics on the view that\nspace  is distinct from body and that time\npasses uniformly without regard to whether anything happens\nin the world. For this reason he spoke of absolute space and\nabsolute time, so as to distinguish these entities from the\nvarious ways by which we measure them (which he called relative\nspaces and relative times). From antiquity into the\neighteenth century, contrary views which denied that space and time\nare real entities maintained that the world is necessarily a material\nplenum. Concerning space, they held that the idea of empty space is a\nconceptual impossibility. Space is nothing but an abstraction we use\nto compare different arrangements of the bodies constituting the\nplenum. Concerning time, they insisted, there can be no lapse of time\nwithout change occurring somewhere. Time is merely a measure of \ncycles of change within the world.  \n\n Associated with these issues about the ontological status of space\nand time was the question of the nature of true motion. Newton defined\nthe true motion of a body to be its motion through absolute\nspace. Those who, before or shortly after Newton, rejected the reality\nof space, did not necessarily deny that there is a fact of the matter\nas to the state of true motion of any given body. They thought rather\nthat the concept of true motion could be analyzed in terms of the\nspecifics of the relative motions or the causes thereof. The\ndifficulty (or, as Newton alleged, the impossibility) of so doing\nconstituted for Newton a strong argument for the existence of absolute\nspace.  \n\n In recent literature, Newton's theses regarding the ontology of space\nand time have come to be called substantivalism in contrast\nto relationism. It should be emphasized, though, that Newton\ndid not regard space and time as genuine substances (as are,\nparadigmatically, bodies and minds), but rather as real entities with\ntheir own manner of existence as necessitated by God's existence (more\nspecifically, his omnipresence and eternality).  \n",
