    "main_text": "Perspectives on connexive logic || Negation\n3.3 Negation\n\nAs the characteristic connexive principles exhibit an implication and\na negation connective, it is not very surprising that connexive logic\ncan be approached also from considerations on the notion of negation.\nTwo different perspectives emerge with the ideas of negation as\ncancellation (erasure, neutralization, or subtraction) and negation as\nfalsity. Negation as cancellation is a conception of negation that can\nbe traced back to Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics and is\noften associated with Strawson, who held that a \u201ccontradiction\ncancels itself and leaves nothing\u201d (1952, p. 3). Routley (1978,\nRoutley et al. 1982), Routley and Routley 1985, and Priest\n1999 use the notion of subtraction negation to motivate connexive\nprinciples. Routley and Routley (1985, p. 205) present the\ncancellation view of negation as follows:\n\n\u223cA deletes, neutralizes, erases, cancels A (and\nsimilarly, since the relation is symmetrical, A erases\n\u223cA), so that \u223cA together with A\nleaves nothing, no content. The conjunction of A and\n\u223cA says nothing, so nothing more specific follows. In\nparticular, A \u2227 \u223cA does not entail\nA and does not entail \u223cA.\n\n\nNote that if a logic implements the cancellation view of negation, it\nwill also be paraconsistent because the ex contradictione\nquodlibet principle, (A \u2227 \u223cA) \u22a2\nB, will not be valid. (The idea of ex contradictione\nnihil sequitur is discussed in Wagner 1991.) According to the\nRoutleys, a connection between the subtraction account of negation and\nAristotle\u2019s thesis AT\u2032 then arises as follows (Routley and\nRoutley 1985, p. 205):\n\nEntailment is inclusion of logical content. So, if A were to\nentail ~A, it would include as part of its content, what\nneutralizes it, ~A, in which event it would entail nothing,\nhaving no content. So it is not the case that A entails\n~A, that is Aristotle\u2019s thesis ~(A \u2192\n~A) holds.\n\n\nAccordingly then, for Routley (Routley et al. 1982, p. 82)\nconnexivism has two leading theses, namely:\n\n1. Simplification (A \u2227 B \u2192 A,\nA \u2227 B \u2192 B) fails to hold, and its\nuse ... is what is responsible for the paradoxes of implication ...\n\n2. Every statement is self-consistent, symbolically A \u25c7\nA, where the relation of consistency with, symbolised\n\u25c7, is interconnected with implication in the standard fashion:\nA \u25c7 B \u2194. ~(A \u2192\n~B).\n\n\nThe cancellation view of negation has been heavily criticized in\nWansing and Skurt 2018, where it is stressed that connexive logic can\nbe detached from the notion of negation as erasure and the failure of\nConjunctive Simplification.\n\nThe notion of negation as definite falsity, in contrast to negation as\nabsence of truth, does not support the failure of Conjunctive\nSimplification but rather the failure of ex contradictione\nquodlibet if it is coupled with an understanding of inference as\ninformation flow, because the information that A \u2227\n~A does not necessarily give the information that B,\nfor any B whatsoever. This suggests a separate treatment of\n(support of) truth and (support of) falsity conditions, which enables\nadopting the falsity conditions for implications represented by\nBTe\u2032.\n",
