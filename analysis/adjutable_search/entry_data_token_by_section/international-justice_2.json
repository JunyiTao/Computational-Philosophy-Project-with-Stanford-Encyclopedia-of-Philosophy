Varieties of Institutionalism\n\nDespite the fact that almost no element of The Law of Peoples\nhas escaped controversy, it served as a well-spring of additional\ntheorizing (see generally Martin & Reidy 2006) and has structured\nthe subsequent debate concerning international distributive justice.\nRawls\u2019s two-tiered account strongly influenced those\ntheorists who were unsatisfied with both cosmopolitan and nationalist\naccounts of distributive justice. Much of the ensuing discussion has\npitted two groups of theorists who both purport to be building upon\nwhat they take to be the key insights of Rawls\u2019s view. One\ngroup\u2014we will call them right\ninstitutionalists\u2014has followed the general contours of\nRawls\u2019s two-tiered account, developing more detailed accounts of\nwhy we should sharply distinguish between the international and\ndomestic. They aim to justify Rawls\u2019s fundamental position that\negalitarian distributive justice only operates at the state level,\neven if they disagree with Rawls as to the rationale. Left\ninstitutionalists, on the other hand, have argued that\ninternational politics is characterized by a sufficiently robust set\nof institutions, such that they \u201ctrigger\u201d principles of\ndistributive justice that are more robust and that, pace the\nduty of assistance, operate directly on the distributive consequences\nof international economic regimes. As a consequence, left\ninstitutionalists generally argue for more robust distributive\nobligations and more radical institutional changes than right\ninstitutionalists even though the extent and nature of those\nobligations varies from thinker to thinker.\n\nBefore we go deeper into the divide between left and right\ninstitutionalism, it\u2019s important to note what the two sides\nagree on and to see where the actual disagreements between the two\nsides lie. The important point of agreement lies in their mutual focus\non institutions or rule-governed practices as the trigger of genuinely\negalitarian distributive obligations. Both right and left\ninstitutionalists accept that principles of distributive justice only\napply or are activated in particular institutional contexts or when\npeople mutually participate in practices that are relevant to\ndistribution. So, both right and left institutionalists would deny\nthat we have obligations of distributive justice to, say, the lost\ncity of Atlantis\u2014should it appear\u2014since Atlanteans have\nnot participated with us in shared institutions or practices. In other\nwords, principles of distributive justice apply to, and are activated\nby, a basic structure that mostly determines the distributive shares\nthe participants receive. Right and left institutionalists disagree,\nthen, concerning which institutions activate obligations of\ndistributive justice among participants.\n",
