    "main_text": "Monist Solutions || Diminishing Marginal Value\n3.2 Diminishing Marginal Value\n\nAnother promising strategy that the monist can use in order to explain\nthe complexity in our value choices is the appeal to\n\u2018diminishing marginal value\u2019. The value that is added to\nthe sum by a source of value will tend to diminish after a certain\npoint\u2014this phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal value\n(or, sometimes, diminishing marginal utility). Mill\u2019s higher and\nlower pleasures, which seem to be plural values, might be accommodated\nby the monist in this way. The monist makes sense of discontinuities\nin value by insisting on the distinction between sources of value,\nwhich are often ambiguously referred to as \u2018values\u2019, and\nthe super value. Using a monist utilitarian account of value, we can\ndistinguish between the non-evaluative description of options, the\nintermediate description, and the evaluative description as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nNon-evaluative\n\ndescription\u00a0of\u00a0option\nIntermediate\n\ndescription\u00a0of\u00a0option\nEvaluative\n\ndescription\u00a0of\u00a0option \n\nPainting a picture\n\u2192\nProducing x units\n\nof beauty\n\u2192\nProducing y units\n\nof value \n\nReading a book\n\u2192\nProducing x units\n\nof knowledge\n\u2192\nProducing y units\n\nof value  \n\n\nOn this account, painting produces beauty, and beauty (which is not a\nvalue but the intermediate source of value) produces value. Similarly,\nreading a book produces knowledge, and gaining knowledge produces\nvalue. Now it should be clear how the monist can make sense of\nphenomena like higher and lower pleasures. The non-evaluative options\n(e.g. eating donuts) have diminishing marginal non-basic value.\n\nOn top of that, the intermediate effect, or non-basic value, (e.g.\nexperiencing pleasure) can have a diminishing contribution to value.\nVarying diminishing marginal value in these cases is easily explained\npsychologically. It is just the way we are\u2014we get less and less\nenjoyment from donuts as we eat more and more (at least in one\nsitting). However, we may well get the same amount of enjoyment from\nthe tenth Johnny Cash song that we did from the first. In order to\ndeal with the higher and lower pleasures case the monist will have to\nargue that pleasures themselves can have diminishing marginal\nutility\u2014the monist can argue that gustatory pleasure gets boring\nafter a while, and hence contributes less and less to the super\nvalue\u2014well being, or whatever it\n is.[9]\n\nThis picture brings us back to the distinction between foundational\nand non-foundational pluralism. Notice that the monist theories being\nimagined here are foundationally monist, because they claim that there\nis fundamentally one value, such as pleasure, and they are pluralist\nat the level of ordinary choice because they claim that there are\nintermediate values, such as knowledge and beauty, which are valuable\nbecause of the amount of pleasure they produce (or realize, or\ncontain\u2014the exact relationship will vary from theory to\ntheory).\n",
