    "main_text": "The Role of the Critic and Schlegel\u2019s Romantic Nationalism || Nationalism versus Cosmopolitanism\n7. A.W. Schlegel: A Thinker of Difference\n\nA.W. Schlegel\u2019s writings show a great preoccupation and interest\nin the perspective of the \u2018other\u2019: women, children, and,\nabove all, other cultures. He constantly reminds the reader about the\nnecessity, in critical thought, of creating a link between theory and\npractical experience or historical knowledge. This enables him to\ndefend the idea that two totally different works of art can be great\nand admirable, not only in spite of their differences, but because\nof them. It was indeed this affirmation of difference that\nenabled him to use the notion \u2018Romantic\u2019 in the way that\nhe did. In fact, although Schlegel\u2019s Lectures on Dramatic\nArt can be seen as a plea for modern or Romantic poetry and\nculture in general (\u201cthe feeling of the moderns is, upon the\nwhole, more intense, their fancy more incorporeal, and their thoughts\nmore contemplative\u201d, LDA: 9), in contrast to other authors, he\nis always very careful not to judge modern works of art according to\ntheir similarities or dissimilarities with ancient ones. It was not by\nchance that Schlegel should be the first to introduce the idea of a\ncomparative literature.\n\nThe emphasis on the opposition between ancient and modern art, and its\nparallel to the antagonism between Christianity and Greek pagan\nmythology, are recurring assumptions in 19th century\naesthetics. But Schlegel\u2019s aim is not to conceptualize a\nparticular canon of beauty, but much more, as a means of elevating\noneself above all partial views, to find an approach that may enable\nthe comprehension and enjoyment of the different ways in which art is\nmanifested throughout history. Thus, Schlegel is taking to its highest\npoint the 19th century idealist principle according to\nwhich art is the \u201cpower of creating what is beautiful and\nrepresenting (darstellen) it to the human eye and ear\u201d\n(LDA: 3) as well as the idea that \u201cpoetry, as the fervid\nexpression of our whole being, must assume a new and peculiar form in\ndifferent ages\u201d (LDA: 29).\n\nThe experience of difference also becomes an important element in his\ncritique of art. Schlegel clearly positions himself against modern\ncritics, who consider the mixture of reality and imitation\n\u201cdestructive of theatrical illusion\u201d (LDA: 34). Although\nnot always explicit in his writings, Schlegel constantly stresses the\nidea that in the contemplation of a work of art, the spectator must\nstill perceive the craftedness of the whole; i.e., the difference\nbetween reality and illusion. This is a fundamental element of his\ncriticism of naturalism and his defense of the use of verse and masks\nin theatre. What is more interesting, though, is that the constant\nawareness of the difference between reality and illusion (for instance\nthrough irony) also shows the fundamental fragility of difference\nitself in a much more compelling way than a rigorous classicist work\nof art does. Reality is also an illusion; it also is the result of\ncreative forces, such as language is. \n\nIn this specific sense, Schlegel could be understood as a thinker of\ndifference in a much more radical way than other philosophers of his\ntime. Although Schlegel\u2019s writings have not been considered as\nphilosophical as those of other 19th century German\nphilosophers, his approach to art and its history, and his reflections\non language and cultural differences are much closer to what is\nsometimes called a postmodern comprehension of aesthetics\nthan that of his contemporaries. Indeed, in his characteristically\nunpresumptuous style, Schlegel anticipates philosophers such as\nNietzsche, Blumenberg, or Deleuze.\n",
