    "main_text": "Objections to Williams\u2019s Trope Ontology\n5. Objections to Williams\u2019s Trope Ontology\n\nMany philosophers have admitted tropes into their scheme of things:\nAristotle, Locke, Spinoza and Leibniz, for example. What is\ndistinctive in Williams is not that tropes are admitted as a category,\nbut as the only fundamental category, a trope-based form of\nwhat Schaffer calls \u201cproperty primitivism.\u201d (Schaffer\n2003, 125). All else is constructed out of tropes, including concrete\nparticulars and general properties, whereas tropes themselves are not\nconstructed out of anything else, for example, out of a substance, a\nuniversal and the relation of exemplification. Not surprisingly,\nvarious aspects of Williams\u2019 trope primitivism have been\nsubjected to serious philosophical challenges either directly or\nindirectly.\n\nSome philosophers reject all forms of property primitivism, including\nthat of Williams, on the grounds that properties cannot serve as the\nonly independent elements of being. Properties must be had by objects\nand a property cannot be instantiated in isolation from wholly\ndistinct properties so they lack the requisite independence, the\ncapacity of existing in any combination with \u201cwholly distinct\nexistences.\u201d (Some philosophers go so far as to claim that if a\nproperty P is a trope, then P is dependent on the\nspecific thing that has it and so could not have existed without that\nthing existing; see Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984, Heil 2003.)\nThere are two ways for this objection to go. (1) Armstrong takes the\nostensive fact that properties must be had by objects to establish the\ndependence of properties on non-property particulars, substrata, and,\nthus, the falsity of property primitivism (Armstrong 1989, 115). (2)\nAlternately, one can take the apparent fact that there can be no\nproperties that are not clustered with other properties to show that\nproperties cannot play this role.\n\nIn response to (1), one can challenge the assumption that if\nproperties must be had by objects, then they are not capable of\nindependent existence. Ross Cameron, for example, suggests that\nproperties might both be capable of independent\nexistence\u2014including existing without substrata\u2014and not be\ncapable of existing without being the property of something. (2006,\n104). The dependence of properties on objects is compatible with\nproperty primitivism if one adopts a bundle theory of concrete\nparticulars. In that case, properties are always had by objects since\nthey are always found in bundles, even if only a bundle of one, but\nexist without substrata.\n\nAs for (2), some philosophers reject the requirement that if\nproperties are the only ultimate constituents of reality, then they\nmust be capable of existing in isolation from all other wholly\ndistinct properties (Simons 1994; Denkel 1997). Properties can be both\nthe only ultimate constituents of reality and inter-dependent. This\nresponse requires the rejection of the Humean principle that the basic\nindependent units of being can exist in any combination, including\nunaccompanied (Schaffer 2003, 126). A very different response to (2)\nrejects the necessity of trope clustering altogether (Williams 1966,\n97; Campbell 1981, 479; Schaffer 2003).\n\n\nPlausible though it be, however, that a color or a shape cannot exist\nby itself, I think we have to reject the notion of a standard of\nconcreteness. \u2026 (Williams 1966, 97)\n\n\nAt best, it is a contingent matter that there are no tropes that are\nnot compresent with any other tropes\u2014for example, a mass trope\non its own. (Campbell goes so far as to suggest that there is reason\nto think that there are actual cases of free-floating tropes (1981,\n479)).\n\nEven if the trope primitivist can get around these quite general\nobjections, there remains the most serious objection to\nWilliams\u2019 brand of trope primitivism, an objection that is\nspecific to Williams\u2019 conception of tropes, depending on more\nthan the assumption that tropes are properties. The charge is that a\nWilliamsonian trope is not genuinely simple, but complex embracing, at\nleast, an element that furnishes the nature or content of the trope,\nand an element providing its particularity (Hochberg 1988; Armstrong\n2005; Moreland 1985; Ehring 2011). In short, Williamsonian tropes are\nconstructed out of something else, making them incompatible with trope\nprimitivism.\n\nThis objection is based on two assumptions. First, under\nWilliams\u2019 conception, the nature of a trope is a non-reducible,\nintrinsic matter that is not determined by relations to anything else,\nincluding resemblance relations to other tropes or memberships in\nvarious natural classes of tropes. And, second, anything that stands\nin more than one arbitrarily different relation, each of which is\ngrounded intrinsically in that entity, must be complex since that\nentity will have intrinsic \u201caspects\u201d that are not\nidentical to each other. The two relevant relations are numerical\ndifference from other tropes and resemblance to other tropes, each of\nwhich is grounded intrinsically in the trope relata under the Williams\nconception. Hence, there are \u201cintrinsic aspects\u201d of each\ntrope that are not identical to each other, a particularity-generating\ncomponent and a nature-generating component.\n\nIn response to this \u201ccomplexity\u201d objection, Campbell\nclaims that the distinction between a trope\u2019s nature and its\nparticularity is merely a \u201cformal\u201d distinction, a product\nof different levels of abstraction, and not a real distinction between\ndifferent components of a trope. One should no more distinguish a\nparticularity-component from a nature-component of a trope than\ndistinguish components of warmth and orangeness in an orange\ntrope:\n\n\nTo recognize the case of orange as warm is not to find a new feature\nin it, but to treat it more abstractly, less specifically, than in\nrecognising it as a case of orange. (Campbell 1990, 56\u20137;\nfurther in Maurin 2005; Fisher 2020)\n\n\nAlternately, Ehring suggests that we grant this objection, but\npreserve trope simplicity by switching to a non-Williamsonian\nconception of tropes, according to which a trope\u2019s nature is\ndetermined by its memberships in various natural classes of tropes\nrather than intrinsically, thereby sidestepping one of the assumptions\noperative in the objection (2011; discussion in Hakkarainen and\nKein\u00e4nen 2017).\n\nComing under criticism as well is Williams\u2019 resemblance-based\naccount of general characteristics and property agreement. According\nto Williams, a fully determinate general color\ncharacteristic\u2014say, the shade of red that characterizes this\nshirt and this chair\u2014-is just the set of all tropes that exactly\nresemble the red trope of this shirt. Different objects of that\n\u201csame\u201d shade of red each possess a different trope from\nthis set of exactly similar red tropes. But this analysis seems to\ngenerate an infinite regress. If trope t1 is\nrelated to trope t2 by resemblance trope\nr1, t2 is related to trope\nt3 by resemblance trope r2,\nand t3 is related to t1 by\nresemblance trope r3, then these resemblance\ntropes will also resemble each other, giving rise to further\nresemblance tropes, and so on. To stop this vicious regress, the\nobjection continues, resemblance must be taken to be a universal (Daly\n1997, 150).\n\nOne response to this objection tries to stop the regress before it\nstarts by denying that there are any resemblance trope-relations\nholding between tropes. In particular, the trope theorist might follow\nOliver\u2019s advise\n\n\nto avoid saying that when two tropes are exactly similar \u2026,\nthere exists a relation-trope of exact similarity \u2026 holding\nbetween the two tropes. (1996, 37)\n\n\nThere are no resemblance-tropes corresponding to these resemblance\npredicates. Another response denies that resemblance relations mark an\naddition to our ontology and, hence, there can be no regress of\nresemblance relations. Campbell, for example, argues that the\nsuccessive resemblance relations in the regress are nothing over and\nabove the non-relational tropes that ultimately ground these\nrelations. Since resemblance is an internal relation, it supervenes on\nthese ground-level non-resemblance tropes, but supervenient\n\u201cadditions\u201d are not real additions to one\u2019s ontology\n(Campbell 1990, 37).\n\nThere is also a whole host of objections in the literature to\nWilliams\u2019 trope bundle theory. According to Williams, concrete\nparticulars are not substrata instantiating various properties. They\nare wholly constructed out of tropes, forming bundles of tropes, the\ntrope constituents of which are pairwise tied together by a\ncompresence relation. Compresence, in turn, is collocation for\nWilliams, \u201cthe unique congress in the same volume.\u201d (In\norder to allow for non-spatial objects, Williams grants the\npossibility of \u201clocations\u201d in systems analogous to space\n(1966, 79).) One immediate worry, raised by Campbell, is the\npossibility that there may be cases of overlapping objects\ndemonstrating that collocation is not sufficient for compresence\n(1990, footnote 5, 175). In response, the trope bundle theorist can\nopt for the view that compresence is non-reducible. However, even with\nthis revision there remain significant objections concerning the\npossibility of accidental properties, the possibility of change, and\nan apparent vicious regress of compresence relations.\n\nBundle theory has been charged with ruling out the possibility of\naccidental properties in concrete particulars. Bundles of properties\nhave all of their constituent properties essentially. Objects\ngenerally do not. This chair could have been blue instead of red, but\nthe bundle of properties that characterize the chair could not have\nfailed to include that red property. One way around this objection is\nproposed by O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne and Cover: combine bundle theory\n(although for them properties are universals) with a specific account\nof modality, a counterpart semantics for statements about ordinary\nparticulars (1998). What makes it true that a particular object\no could have had different properties is that a non-identical\ncounterpart to o, n, in another possible world has\ndifferent properties than does o. As long as there is a\npossible world in which there is a object-bundle, n, that is\nnon-identical counterpart to o and differs from o\nwith respect to its properties, then o could have differed in\njust that way.\n\nSimons suggests a very different approach. He proposes to replace\nunstructured bundles with \u201cnucleus theory.\u201d An object\nconsists of an inner core of essential tropes and an outer band of\naccidental tropes, but no non-property substratum (1994).\n\nIn like manner, bundle theory has been charged with ruling out the\npossibility of change in objects. The same bundle complex cannot be\ncomposed of one set of property at one time, but a different set at a\ndifferent time. Concrete objects, on the other hand, can and do\nchange. In response, it has been suggested that this objection loses\nits force if bundle theory is combined with a four-dimensionalist\naccount of object persistence (Casullo 1988; see also Ehring 2011).\nFor example, if ordinary objects are spacetime worms made up of\nappropriately related instantaneous temporal parts that are themselves\ncomplete bundles of compresent tropes, then change can be read as a\nmatter of having different temporal parts that differ in their\nconstitutive properties. Another response to the change-is-impossible\nobjection is to adopt Simons\u2019 \u201cnucleus theory\u201d in\nplace of traditional bundle theory. Nucleus theory seems to allow for\nchange in the outer band of accidental properties (Simons 1994).\n\nTrope bundle theory has also been accused of giving rise to\nBradley-style vicious regress. According to trope bundle theory, for\nan object o to exist, its tropes must be mutually compresent. However,\nit would seem, for trope t1 to be compresent with\ntrope t2, they must be linked by a compresence\ntrope, say, c1. But, the existence of\nt1, t2, and\nc1 is insufficient to make it the case that\nt1 and t2 are compresent since\nthese tropes could each be parts of different, non-overlapping\nbundles. So for t1 and t2 to\nbe linked by compresence trope c1,\nc1 must be compresent with t1\nby way of a further compresence relation, say c2\n(and with t2 by, say, c3) and\nso on, giving rise to either a vicious, or at least, uneconomical\nregress (Maurin 2010, 315). In response, one can try to break the link\nbetween the relevant predicates and tropes. Oliver suggests that the\ntrope theorist should reject the assumption that there are any\nrelation-tropes corresponding to the predicate \u201c\u2026.is\ncompresent with\u2026\u201d even though that predicate has some\ntrue applications (1996, 37). This response might be indirectly\nsupported by reference to Lewis\u2019s claim that it is an impossible\ntask to give an analysis of all predications since any analysis will\nbring into play a new predication, itself requiring analysis (Lewis\n1983, 353).\n\nA second, quite different response is modeled on Armstrong\u2019s\nview that \u201cinstantiation\u201d is a \u201ctie,\u201d not a\nrelation (since \u201cthe thisness and nature are incapable of\nexisting apart\u201d), and, hence, it is not subject to a relation\nregress. (1978, 109). The idea is that the union of compresent tropes\nis too intimate to speak of a relation between them since the tropes\nof the same object could not have existed apart from each other. This\nresponse, however, requires more than generic dependencies\u2014for\nexample, that this specific mass trope requires the existence of some\nsolidity trope or other\u2014since generic dependencies would not\nguarantee that the specific mass and solidity tropes, say, in this\nparticular bundle could not have existed without being compresent.\n\nMaurin provides an alternative response that grants the existence of\ncompresence relation-tropes, but denies the regress on the grounds\nthat relation-tropes, including compresence relations, necessitate the\nexistence of that which they relate. There is no need for further\ncompresence relations holding between a compresence-relation and its\nterms (2002, 164). A fourth response, from Ehring, suggests that this\nregress can be stopped once it is recognized that compresence is a\nself-relating relation, a relation that can take itself as a relatum.\nThe supposed infinite regress for the bundle theorist involves an\nunending series of compresence tropes, c1,\nc2, \u2026, and cn,\nbut the series, c1, c2,\n\u2026, and cn is taken to be infinite\nbecause it is assumed that each \u201cadditional\u201d compresence\ntrope is not identical to the immediate preceding compresence\ntrope in the series. However, if compresence is a\n\u201cself-relating\u201d relation, this assumption may be false\n(2011).\n\nFinally, there is an objection to the very notion of a trope and,\nhence, to the foundations of trope primitivism (and, perhaps, to any\nontology that includes tropes). The idea is that if properties are\ntropes, then exactly similar properties can be swapped across objects,\nbut there is no such possibility.\n\n\nIf the redness of this rose is exactly similar to but numerically\ndistinct from the redness of that rose, then the redness of this rose\ncould have been the redness of that rose and vice versa. But this is\nnot really a possibility and, thus, properties are not tropes.\n(Armstrong 1989, 131\u2013132)\n\n\nA similar argument is based on the possibility of tropes swapping\npositions in space (Campbell 1990, 71). \u201cProperty\nswapping,\u201d it is claimed, is an unreal possibility since\nproperty swapping would make no difference to the world. (Note that\nthe cross-object version of this objection cannot get off the ground\nif tropes are not transferable between objects, a view that is found\nin (Martin 1980), although Martin rejects trope primitivism since he\nposits substrata in addition to tropes).\n\nOne response to the no-swapping objection, given by Campbell and\nLabossiere, rejects the assumption that trope swaps would make no\ndifference to the world. For example, although the effects of\n\u201cswapped\u201d situations would be exactly similar in nature,\nthose effects would differ in their causes (Campbell 1990, 72;\nLabossiere 1993, 262). Schaffer, on the other hand, denies that the\ntrope theory is automatically committed to the possibility of trope\nswapping (2001). If tropes are individuated by times/locations and a\ncounterpart theory of modality is right, then trope swapping is ruled\nout:\n\n\nThe redness which would be here has exactly the same inter- and\nintraworld resemblance relations as the redness which actually is\nhere, and the same distance relations, and hence it is a better\ncounterpart than the redness which would be there. (Schaffer\n2001, 253).\n\n\nWhat is clear is that Williams\u2019 trope ontology remains at the\ncenter of a vibrant and ongoing debate, counting as a serious option\namong a small field of contenders. His brand of trope primitivism is\ncertainly of more than merely historical interest.\n\nWilliams has also left a wider, if less plainly manifest legacy as a\nmetaphysician. For a discussion of his influence on David Lewis, and\nthrough him on later thinkers, see Fisher 2015.\n",
