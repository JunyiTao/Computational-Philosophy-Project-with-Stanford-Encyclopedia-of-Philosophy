    "main_text": "A taxonomy || Demarcating abilities\n1.2 Demarcating abilities\n\nAbilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely,\nis an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two\nadditional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an\nability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects.\nAbilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not\nagents. Objects have dispositions and affordances \u2014 as a glass\nis disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid\n\u2014 but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is\nnot, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is\nbecause agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second,\nabilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate\nagents to actions.\n\nSome examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some\npowers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any\nrelation to action. Consider the power of understanding language.\nUnderstanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational,\nis not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus\nthe power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present\ntaxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability,\nsince it involves a relation to action. (See van Inwagen 1983,\n8\u201313.)\n\nSo, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that\nrelates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities,\nwhile serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it\ninherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between\nactions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain\nof action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem\nthat, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible\nthat the domain of action will be vague, so that there are\nsome events that are not definitely actions, but that are not\ndefinitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about\naction apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is\nright, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in\nterms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and\nvague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the\ntheory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For\ngiving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on\nparadigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of\nability.\n\nNote there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as\ndistinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active\npowers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the\nwill (Reid 1788/2000). But it is not clear that these distinctions\noverlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be\nan active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability,\nfor the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question\nof whether willing is itself an action.\n",
