    "main_text": "The Problem of Demarcation\n3. The Problem of Demarcation\n\nFor Popper the central problem in the philosophy of science is that of\ndemarcation, i.e., of distinguishing between science and what he terms\n\u201cnon-science\u201d (e.g., logic, metaphysics, psychoanalysis,\nand Adler\u2019s individual psychology). Popper is unusual amongst\ncontemporary philosophers in that he accepts the validity of\nthe Humean critique of induction, and indeed, goes beyond it in\narguing that induction is never actually used in science. However, he\ndoes not concede that this entails scepticism and argues that the\nBaconian/Newtonian insistence on the primacy of \u201cpure\u201d\nobservation, as the initial step in the formation of theories, is\ncompletely misguided: all observation is selective and theory-laden\nand there are no pure or theory-free observations. In this way he\ndestabilises the traditional view that science can be distinguished\nfrom non-science on the basis of its inductive methodology. In\ncontradistinction to this, Popper holds that there is no unique\nmethodology specific to science; rather, science, like virtually every\nother organic activity, consists largely of problem-solving.\n\nPopper accordingly rejects the view that induction is the\ncharacteristic method of scientific investigation and inference,\nsubstituting falsifiability in its place. It is easy, he\nargues, to obtain evidence in favour of virtually any theory, and he\nconsequently holds that such \u201ccorroboration\u201d, as he terms\nit, should count scientifically only if it is the positive result of a\ngenuinely \u201crisky\u201d prediction, which might conceivably have\nbeen false. In a critical sense, Popper\u2019s theory of demarcation\nis based upon his perception of the asymmetry which, at the level of\nlogic, holds between verification and falsification: it is logically\nimpossible to verify a universal proposition by reference to\nexperience (as Hume saw clearly), but a single genuine\ncounter-instance falsifies the corresponding universal law. In a word,\nan exception, far from \u201cproving\u201d a rule, conclusively\nrefutes it.\n\nEvery genuine scientific theory then, in Popper\u2019s view, is\nprohibitive, because the theories of natural science take the\nform of universal statements. \u201cAll As are\nX\u201d is equivalent to \u201cNo A is\nnot-X\u201d which is falsified if \u201cSome A is\nnot-X\u201d turns out to be true. For example, the law of\nthe conservation of energy can be expressed as \u201cThere is no\nperpetual motion machine\u201d.\n\nHowever, the universality of such laws, he argues, does rule out the\npossibility of their verification. Thus, a theory that has withstood\nrigorous testing should be deemed to have received a high measure of\ncorroboration. and may be retained provisionally as the best available\ntheory until it is finally falsified and/or is superseded by a better\ntheory.\n\nPopper stresses in particular that there is no unique way, no single\nmethod such as induction, which functions as the route to scientific\ntheory, and approvingly cites Einstein on that point:\n\n\nThere is no logical path leading to [the highly universal laws of\nscience]. They can only be reached by intuition, based upon something\nlike an intellectual love of the objects of experience. (2002:\n8\u20139)\n\n\nScience, in Popper\u2019s view, starts with problems rather than with\nobservations\u2014it is, indeed, precisely in the context of\ngrappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the\nfirst instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the\nextent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to\na given problem.\n\nOn this criterion of demarcation physics, chemistry, and\n(non-introspective) psychology, amongst others, are classified as\nsciences, psychoanalysis is a pre-science and astrology and phrenology\nare pseudo-sciences.\n",
