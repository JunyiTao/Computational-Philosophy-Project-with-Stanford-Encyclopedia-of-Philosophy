Connectionism and the Elimination of Folk Psychology\n\nAnother important application of connectionist research to\nphilosophical debate about the mind concerns the status of folk\npsychology. Folk psychology is the conceptual structure that we\nspontaneously apply to understanding and predicting human behavior.\nFor example, knowing that John desires a beer and that he believes\nthat there is one in the refrigerator allows us to explain why John\njust went into the kitchen. Such knowledge depends crucially on our\nability to conceive of others as having desires and goals, plans for\nsatisfying them, and beliefs to guide those plans. The idea that\npeople have beliefs, plans and desires is a commonplace of ordinary\nlife; but does it provide a faithful description of what is actually\nto be found in the brain?\n\nIts defenders will argue that folk psychology is too good to be false\n(Fodor 1988: Ch. 1). What more can we ask for the truth of a theory\nthan that it provides an indispensable framework for successful\nnegotiations with others? On the other hand, eliminativists will\nrespond that the useful and widespread use of a conceptual scheme does\nnot argue for its truth (Churchland 1989: Ch. 1). Ancient astronomers\nfound the notion of celestial spheres useful (even essential) to the\nconduct of their discipline, but now we know that there are no\ncelestial spheres. From the eliminativists\u2019 point of view, an\nallegiance to folk psychology, like allegiance to folk (Aristotelian)\nphysics, stands in the way of scientific progress. A viable psychology\nmay require as radical a revolution in its conceptual foundations as\nis found in quantum mechanics.\n\nEliminativists are interested in connectionism because it promises to\nprovide a conceptual foundation that might replace folk psychology.\nFor example Ramsey, Stich, & Garon (1991) have argued that certain\nfeed-forward nets show that simple cognitive tasks can be performed\nwithout employing features that could correspond to beliefs, desires\nand plans. Presuming that such nets are faithful to how the brain\nworks, concepts of folk psychology fare no better than do celestial\nspheres. Whether connectionist models undermine folk psychology in\nthis way is still controversial. There are two main lines of response\nto the claim that connectionist models support eliminativist\nconclusions. One objection is that the models used by Ramsey et\nal. are feed forward nets, which are too weak to explain some of the\nmost basic features of cognition such as short term memory. Ramsey et\nal. have not shown that beliefs and desires must be absent in a class\nof nets adequate for human cognition. A second line of rebuttal\nchallenges the claim that features corresponding to beliefs and\ndesires are necessarily absent even in the feed forward nets at issue\n(Von Eckardt 2005).\n\nThe question is complicated further by disagreements about the nature\nof folk psychology. Many philosophers treat the beliefs and desires\npostulated by folk psychology as brain states with symbolic contents.\nFor example, the belief that there is a beer in the refrigerator is\nthought to be a brain state that contains symbols corresponding to\nbeer and a refrigerator. From this point of view, the fate of folk\npsychology is strongly tied to the symbolic processing hypothesis. So\nif connectionists can establish that brain processing is essentially\nnon-symbolic, eliminativist conclusions will follow. On the other\nhand, some philosophers do not think folk psychology is essentially\nsymbolic, and some would even challenge the idea that folk psychology\nis to be treated as a theory in the first place. Under this\nconception, it is much more difficult to forge links between results\nin connectionist research and the rejection of folk psychology.\n",
