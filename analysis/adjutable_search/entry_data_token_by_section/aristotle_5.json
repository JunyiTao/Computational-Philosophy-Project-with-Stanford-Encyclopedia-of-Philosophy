    "main_text": "Logic, Science, and Dialectic || Science\n4.2  Science\n\n           \nAristotle approaches the study of logic not as an end in itself, but\nwith a view to its role in human inquiry and explanation. Logic is a\ntool, he thinks, one making an important but incomplete contribution\nto science and dialectic. Its contribution is incomplete because\nscience (epist\u00eam\u00ea) employs arguments which are\nmore than mere deductions. A deduction is minimally a valid syllogism,\nand certainly science must employ arguments passing this\nthreshold. Still, science needs more: a science proceeds\nby organizing the data in its domain into a series of\narguments which, beyond being deductions, feature premises which are\nnecessary and, as Aristotle says, \u201cbetter known by\nnature\u201d, or \u201cmore intelligible by nature\u201d\n(gn\u00f4rim\u00f4teron phusei)\n(APo. 71b33\u201372a25; Top. 141b3\u201314;\nPhys. 184a16\u201323). By this he means that they should\nreveal the genuine, mind-independent natures of things. \n\n\nHe further insists that science\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea)\u2014a comparatively broad term in\nhis usage, since it extends to fields of inquiry like mathematics and\nmetaphysics no less than the empirical sciences\u2014not only reports\nthe facts but also explains them by displaying their priority\nrelations (APo. 78a22\u201328). That is, science explains what is\nless well known by what is better known and more fundamental, and what\nis explanatorily anemic by what is explanatorily fruitful. \n\n\nWe may, for instance, wish to know why trees lose their leaves in the\nautumn. We may say, rightly, that this is due to the wind blowing\nthrough them. Still, this is not a deep or general explanation, since\nthe wind blows equally at other times of year without the same\nresult. A deeper explanation\u2014one unavailable to Aristotle but\nillustrating his view nicely\u2014is more general, and also more\ncausal in character: trees shed their leaves because diminished\nsunlight in the autumn inhibits the production of chlorophyll, which\nis required for photosynthesis, and without photosynthesis trees go\ndormant.  Importantly, science should not only record these facts but\nalso display them in their correct explanatory order. That is,\nalthough a deciduous tree which fails to photosynthesize is also a\ntree lacking in chlorophyll production, its failing to produce\nchlorophyll explains its inability to photosynthesize and not the\nother way around.  This sort of asymmetry must be captured in\nscientific explanation. Aristotle\u2019s method of scientific exposition is\ndesigned precisely to discharge this requirement.\n\n\nScience seeks to capture not only the causal priorities in nature,\nbut also its deep, invariant patterns. Consequently, in addition\nto being explanatorily basic, the first premise in a scientific\ndeduction will be necessary. So, says Aristotle:\n\n\nWe think we understand a thing without qualification, and not in the\nsophistic, accidental way, whenever we think we know the cause in\nvirtue of which something is\u2014that it is the cause of that very\nthing\u2014and also know that this cannot be otherwise. \nClearly, knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea) is something of this\nsort. After all, both those with knowledge and those without it\nsuppose that this is so\u2014although only those with knowledge are\nactually in this condition. Hence, whatever is known without\nqualification cannot be otherwise. (APo 71b9\u201316; cf.\nAPo 71b33\u201372a5; Top. 141b3\u201314, Phys.\n184a10\u201323; Met. 1029b3\u201313) \n\n\nFor this reason, science requires more than mere deduction.\nAltogether, then, the currency of science is demonstration\n(apodeixis), where a demonstration is a deduction with\npremises revealing the causal structures of the world, set forth so as\nto capture what is necessary and to reveal what is better known and\nmore intelligible by nature (APo\n71b33\u201372a5, Phys. 184a16\u201323, EN 1095b2\u20134). \n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s approach to the appropriate form of scientific explanation\ninvites reflection upon a troubling epistemological question: how does\ndemonstration begin? If we are to lay out demonstrations such that the\nless well known is inferred by means of deduction from the better\nknown, then unless we reach rock-bottom, we will evidently be forced\neither to continue ever backwards towards the increasingly better\nknown, which seems implausibly endless, or lapse into some form of\ncircularity, which seems undesirable.  The alternative seems to be\npermanent ignorance.  Aristotle contends:\n\n\nSome people think that since knowledge obtained via demonstration\nrequires the knowledge of primary things, there is no knowledge. \nOthers think that there is knowledge and that all knowledge is\ndemonstrable. Neither of these views is either true or\nnecessary.   The first group, those supposing that there is\nno knowledge at all, contend that we are confronted with an infinite\nregress. They contend that we cannot know posterior things\nbecause of prior things if none of the prior things is primary. \nHere what they contend is correct: it is indeed impossible to traverse\nan infinite series. Yet, they maintain, if the regress comes to a\nhalt, and there are first principles, they will be unknowable, since\nsurely there will be no demonstration of first principles\u2014given,\nas they maintain, that only what is demonstrated can be known. \nBut if it is not possible to know the primary things, then neither can\nwe know without qualification or in any proper way the things derived\nfrom them. Rather, we can know them instead only on the basis of\na hypothesis, to wit, if the primary things obtain, then so\ntoo do the things derived from them. The other group agrees that\nknowledge results only from demonstration, but believes that nothing\nstands in the way of demonstration, since they admit circular and\nreciprocal demonstration as possible. (APo. 72b5\u201321)\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s own preferred alternative is clear:\n\n\nWe contend that not all knowledge is demonstrative: knowledge of the\nimmediate premises is indemonstrable. Indeed, the necessity here\nis apparent; for if it is necessary to know the prior things, that is,\nthose things from which the demonstration is derived, and if eventually\nthe regress comes to a standstill, it is necessary that these immediate\npremises be indemonstrable. (APo. 72b21\u201323)\n\n\nIn sum, if all knowledge requires demonstration, and all\ndemonstration proceeds from what is more intelligible by nature to what\nis less so, then either the process goes on indefinitely or it comes to\na halt in undemonstrated first principles, which are known, and known\nsecurely. Aristotle dismisses the only remaining possibility,\nthat demonstration might be circular, rather curtly, with the remark\nthat this amounts to  \u2018simply saying that something is the\ncase if it is the case,\u2019 by which device \u2018it is easy to\nprove anything\u2019 (APo. 72b32\u201373a6).\n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s own preferred alternative, that there are first\nprinciples of the sciences graspable by those willing to engage in\nassiduous study, has caused consternation in many of his readers.\n  In Posterior Analytics ii 19, he describes the\nprocess by which knowers move from perception to memory, and from memory\nto experience (empeiria)\u2014which is a fairly technical\nterm in this connection, reflecting the point at which a single\nuniversal comes to take root in the mind\u2014and finally from\nexperience to a grasp of first principles.   This final\nintellectual state Aristotle characterizes as a kind of unmediated\nintellectual apprehension (nous) of first principles\n(APo. 100a10\u2013b6).\n\nScholars have understandably queried what seems a casually asserted\npassage from the contingent, given in sense experience, to the\nnecessary, as required for the first principles of science. Perhaps,\nhowever, Aristotle simply envisages a kind of a posteriori\nnecessity for the sciences, including the natural sciences. In any\nevent, he thinks that we can and do have knowledge, so that somehow we\nbegin in sense perception and build up to an understanding of the\nnecessary and invariant features of the world. This is the knowledge\nfeatured in genuine science (epist\u00eam\u00ea). In\nreflecting on the sort of progression Aristotle envisages, some\ncommentators have charged him with an epistemological optimism\nbordering on the na\u00efve; others contend that it is rather the\ncharge of na\u00efvet\u00e9 which is itself na\u00efve, betraying as\nit does an unargued and untenable alignment of the necessary and\nthe a\n priori.[7]\n",
