    "main_text": "Recent Re-evaluations\n8. The Continuation of the Story\n\nThe prolonged debate in the German-speaking lands over psychologism\nwas eventually brought to an end by World War One. The war brought\nwith it an intellectual climate in which attacks on one\u2019s\ncolleagues were regarded as utterly inappropriate. Moreover, it also\nlead to a clear division of labor between psychologists and\nphilosophers: while philosophers concentrated on the ideological task\nof celebrating the German \u2018genius of war\u2019, experimental\npsychology focused on the training and testing of soldiers. After the\nwar, both academic (anti-naturalistic) philosophy and (experimental)\npsychology had to cope with, and accommodate to, an intellectual\nenvironment that was hostile to science, rationality, and systematic\nknowledge. The project of a scientifically-minded philosophy with\nexperimental psychology as its central pillar quickly lost support.\nAnd hence the charge of psychologism could no longer play a central\nrole.\n\nEarly twentieth-century German-speaking philosophy exerted of course a\npowerful and lasting influence on philosophy in many other countries,\nnotably in the Anglo-American world. For a while Frege\u2019s and\nHusserl\u2019s arguments against antipsychologism even rose to the\nstatus of a paradigmatic achievement in philosophy: \u2018There is\nprogress in philosophy after all!\u2019 (Musgrave 1972, 606). As I\nhave indicated in the last section, this assessment of\nantipsychologism is now widely contested.\n\nOther countries of course had their own debates over the relation\nbetween psychology and philosophy. In the UK, for instance, George\nFrederick Stout and James Ward emphasised the philosophical\nsignificance of psychology; British Idealists like Francis Herbert\nBradley and Brand Blanshard were sympathetic to psychology even though\nthey denied its philosophical credentials; and realists like John Cook\nWilson, Bertrand Russell, Herbert Joseph, and Harold Arthur Prichard\ninsisted on a separation. For Prichard, psychology was not even a\n\u2018proper science\u2019 (Passmore 1994).\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, and at the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century, psychology exerted and exerts a powerful pull on\nphilosophers who wish to put philosophy on the sure path of a science.\nQuine famously called for a return to psychologism in the 1960s. Such\ncalls have kept the psychologism accusation alive. Amongst the accused\none can find the names of Rudolf Carnap, Michael Dummett, Peter Geach,\nNelson Goodman, Thomas Kuhn, John McDowell, Karl Popper, Wilfrid\nSellars, and Ludwig Wittgenstein (Kusch 1995, 7). (For an extensive\ndiscussion of naturalistic and psychologistic positions from the\nperspective on twenty-first-century philosophy of logic, see Pelletier\net al. 2008.
