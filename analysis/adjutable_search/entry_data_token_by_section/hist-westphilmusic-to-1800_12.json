    "main_text": "Early Modern Period || Melody and Expression: The Florentine Camerata\n3.2 Melody and Expression: The Florentine Camerata\n\nIn Book II of his Dodecachordon (1547), the humanist Heinrich\nGlarean (also known as Glareanus) (1488\u20131563) argues that\ncomposers of polyphonic music are inferior to those who set a single\nmelodic line to a text. He speculates that the latter was the way\nGreeks, Romans, and early Christian communities composed music. Monody\nis superior on the grounds that it requires an exercise in invention,\nwhereas the polyphonist merely borrows a melodic line and then carries\nout a task that is predominantly intellectual. According to Glareanus,\nmonody has a natural character and an expressive immediacy that is\nlost in subsequent development. Less than half a century later, both\nthe reference to a classical model and the vindication of monody\nbecame crucially important in Italian musical thinking and practice.\nToward the end of the sixteenth century, a group of Florentine\nintellectuals and musicians gathered around the figure of Giovanni\nde\u2019 Bardi, a nobleman and amateur musician. This group is\nnormally referred to as the Florentine Camerata, or Camerata de\u2019\nBardi. Its goal was to recover the expressive potential of music, as\ndescribed in ancient Greek and Roman sources. Music\u2019s power to\narouse emotions was thought to have been lost during the Middle Ages,\nas polyphony developed. The envisaged solution was a return to monody,\nand more precisely to a melodic line that would follow and emphasize\nthe prosodic features of impassioned speech (Palisca 2006: chapter 7;\nPalisca 1989 is an influential collection of source readings). Thus,\nthe main goal of the Camerata seems to have been expression, to be\nintended here as the arousal of emotion, while the imitation of speech\nprosody was considered a means to that end. This is philosophically\nsignificant in that it indicates a revival of the classical Greek idea\nthat music is expressive in virtue of its resemblance to the way human\nbeings express their emotions (see\n \u00a71.3).\n\nThis resulted in the birth of the so-called stile\nrappresentativo, the vocal style characteristic of early opera,\nof which Claudio Monteverdi\u2019s (1567\u20131643)\nL\u2019Orfeo (1607) is considered the first masterpiece.\nGiulio Caccini (1550\u20131618) and Jacopo Peri (1561\u20131633)\nwere active members of the Camerata, and have both left explicit\ndiscussion of the theories that informed their musical style (relevant\ntextual excerpts are collected in Strunk 1950: 370\u2013392).\n\nWhile Monteverdi may be considered the most representative musician\nassociated with this turn to melody and expression, the\nCamerata\u2019s most significant theoretical figure was Vincenzo\nGalilei (c. 1520\u20131591), an accomplished composer and lutenist,\nfather of the astronomer Galileo. In his Dialogue of Ancient and\nModern Music (1581), Galilei takes issue with contemporary\npractices, particularly with counterpoint. He concedes that the\npolyphonic music of his time is a source of aural pleasure, but faults\nit for its incapacity to move the listener,\n\n\n[f]or its sole aim is to delight the ear, while that of ancient music\nis to induce in another the same passion that one feels oneself.\n(Galilei 1581 [1950: 317])\n\n\nBoth Monteverdi and Galilei faced the reaction of more conservative\nfigures. Giovanni Maria Artusi (c. 1540\u20131613), in\nL\u2019Artusi or Of the Imperfections of Modern Music\n(1600), attacks the work of an unnamed composer, though it is apparent\nthat he has in mind composers such as Monteverdi and Carlo Gesualdo\n(1566\u20131613). Artusi concedes that the newly developed monodic\nstyle is expressive, but denies that expression is worth the sacrifice\nof compositional rules that are dictated by reason. The dispute\nbetween Artusi and Monteverdi crystallized the clash between the\nso-called prima and seconda prattica, the former\nindicating the old polyphonic style, the latter the new preference for\naccompanied monody.\n\nGalilei faced criticism from his former teacher Zarlino. In his\nSopplimenti musicali (1588), Zarlino argues that the\nimitation of impassioned speech belongs to the art of rhetoric or to\ndeclaimed poetry, not music. Musicians should confine themselves to\nthe imitation of the text\u2019s content, rather than to its possible\ndelivery, and they should do so through the choice of appropriate\nharmonies (Zarlino 1588: 316\u2013318). Zarlino\u2019s reservations\nabout expressive melody are of particular importance, as they may be\nseen as the first manifestation of a recurring contrast between two\nopposite tendencies, epitomized by the clash between Rousseau and\nRameau (see\n \u00a73.5).\n Whereas one strand locates music\u2019s chief source of expression\nin melody, the other defends the primacy of harmony, often downplaying\nthe role of possible resemblances between melodic contour and human\nexpressive behavior (Young, forthcoming, names the two tendencies\nempiricism and rationalism, respectively, following\ntheir development and occasional overlap).\n\nDespite their disagreements, both approaches valued expression in\nmusic set to a text. A full vindication of the expressive power of\ninstrumental music was not among the programmatic goals of either the\nCamerata or of those who, like Zarlino, stress the importance of\nharmonic elements. Caccini is critical of music that obscures the\ntext, because\n\n\nsuch music and musicians gave no other delight than what harmony could\ngive the ear, for, unless the words were understood, they could not\nmove the understanding. (Caccini 1600 [1950: 378])\n\n\nZarlino, following Plato, claims that melody and harmony should be\nsuitable to the text, and cashes out this suitability in terms of\nsimilarity:\n\n\nwe must also make a choice of a harmony and a rhythm similar to the\nnature of the matters contained in the speech in order that from the\ncombination of these things, put together with proportion, may result\na melody suited to the purpose. (Zarlino 1558: book IV, 32 [1950:\n256])\n\n\nMoreover, these authors unanimously hold that it is the music that has\nto be adapted to a text, rather than the other way around. In the\nforeword to Monteverdi\u2019s Scherzi Musicali (1607), his\nbrother Giulio Cesare claims that Claudio\u2019s goal was \u201cto\nmake the words the mistress of the harmony and not the servant\u201d\n(Monteverdi 1607 [1950: 406]).\n\nWhile this stress on the priority of the text was the product of a\nrenewed interest in emotional expression in vocal music, Church\nauthorities also became concerned with the confused polyphonic styles\nand the way they obfuscated liturgical content, and thus they also\npromoted textural clarity in polyphonic music (see Fellerer 1953).\n",
