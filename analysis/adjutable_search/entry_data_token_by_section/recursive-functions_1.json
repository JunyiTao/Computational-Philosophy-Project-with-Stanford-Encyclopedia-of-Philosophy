    "main_text": "Historical Background || The Early History of Recursive Definitions\n1.1 The Early History of Recursive Definitions\n\nExamples of recursive definitions can be found intermittently in the\nhistory of ancient and medieval mathematics. A familiar illustration\nis the sequence \\(F_i\\) of Fibonacci numbers\n\\(1,1,2,3,5,8,13, \\ldots\\) given by the recurrence \\(F_0 = 1, F_1 =\n1\\) and \\(F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\\) (see\n Section 2.1.3).\n The definition of this sequence has traditionally been attributed to\nthe thirteenth century Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (also\nknown as Fibonacci) who introduced it in his Liber Abaci in\nthe context of an example involving population genetics (see Fibonacci\n1202 [2003, 404\u2013405]). But descriptions of similar sequences can\nalso be found in Greek, Egyptian, and Sanskrit sources dating as early\nas 700 BCE (see, e.g., Singh 1985).\n\nGeneral interest in recursion as a mode of function definition\noriginated in the mid-nineteenth century as part of the broader\nprogram of arithmetizing analysis and the ensuing discussions of the\nfoundations of arithmetic itself. In this context, the formulation of\nrecursive definitions for number theoretic functions was closely tied\nto the isolation of mathematical induction as a mode of reasoning\nabout the natural numbers. It was in this setting in which Grassmann\n(1861) and Peirce (1881) first gave the familiar recursive definitions\nof addition and\n multiplication:[1]\n \n\\[\\begin{align} \\label{defnadd}\n\\text{i.}\\quad &&  x + 0 & = x \\\\ \\nonumber\n\\text{ii.}\\quad &&  x + (y+1) & = (x+y)+1\n\\end{align}\\]\n \n\\[\\begin{align} \\label{defnmult}\n\\text{i.}\\quad &&  x \\times 0 & = 0 \\\\ \\nonumber\n\\text{ii.}\\quad &&  x \\times (y+1) & = (x\\times y) + x\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThey then used these definition to prove the associative, commutative,\nand distributive laws for these\n operations.[2]\n\n\nThe first person to employ the expression \u201cdefinition by\nrecursion\u201d appears to have been Dedekind in his essay Was\nsind und was sollen die Zahlen (1888). This work presents a set\ntheoretic foundation for arithmetic wherein Dedekind demonstrated that\nit was possible to state and prove the existence and uniqueness of\nfunctions defined by primitive recursion as mathematical theorems\n(\u00a7125\u2013126). He formulated recursive definitions of addition\n(\u00a7135), multiplication (\u00a7147), and exponentiation\n(\u00a7155) and then also formally proved by induction that the\nfunctions so defined satisfy the expected algebraic identities. The\nfirst two of these definitions would later be adopted by Peano (1889)\nas defining the symbols \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) in the direct\naxiomatization of arithmetic he based on Dedekind\u2019s\nmonograph.\n",
