    "main_text": "What is Xuanxue?\n1. What is Xuanxue?\n\nAs a proper term, Xuanxue gained currency during the fifth\ncentury C.E. It named a branch of learning that formed a part of the\ncurriculum of the imperial academy. The subject matter of\nXuanxue in this formal sense centered on the Yijing\n(Classic of Changes), the Laozi, the Zhuangzi, and\nselected commentaries on them. These three classical texts were seen\nto hold deep insight into the cosmos and the human condition, and were\nreferred to collectively as the \u201cThree (Great Works on the)\nProfound\u201d (sanxuan). They articulated their vision of\n\u201cgrand harmony\u201d and \u201cgreat peace\u201d through the\nconcept of Dao, which demanded explication. It is precisely the goal\nof Xuanxue, then, to bring to light the nature and function\nof Dao, which may appear dark or impenetrable.\n\nIn a wider sense, Xuanxue came to describe, retrospectively,\nthe main current of early medieval Chinese philosophy as a whole. This\nis a broad stroke that privileges intellectual unity over diversity.\nHowever, as we will see, family resemblances notwithstanding, there\nare significant differences among individual Xuanxue thinkers\nin their understanding of Dao. Looking back, later historians\ntypically traced the beginnings of Xuanxue to the early third\ncentury C.E. The end of the Han dynasty caused painful disruptions,\nbut it also forced open a space for intellectual renewal. In this\ncontext, the educated elite debated on ways to restore order and\nharmony, based on their interpretation of the teachings of the ancient\nsages and philosophers. The hermeneutical contest was keen, and new\nideas came to the fore through the critical engagement with tradition.\nNevertheless, there was a shared assumption that any blueprint for\nlasting peace and harmony must rest on a clear understanding of Dao,\nwhich provided a point of departure for the unfolding of\nNeo-Daoism.\n\nWhile Xuanxue was guided by what may be called a keen\n\u201cDao-centered\u201d consciousness, it was not a Daoist movement\naimed at dismantling the teachings of Confucius. There is also some\ndebate as to whether Neo-Daoism abandoned sociopolitical engagement\nfor a kind of individualistic escapism. These two points warrant\nfurther discussion, which should give a thicker description of the\ncontext in which Neo-Daoism came into play.\n\nThe close connection between Xuanxue and \u201cPure\nConversation\u201d (qingtan) is often cited as evidence\npointing to the former\u2019s escapist interests. Pure Conversation\nwas one of the hallmarks of early medieval Chinese literati culture.\nIn its mature form, it found expression in high-minded debates on\ntopical philosophical concerns, such as the relationship between\n\u201ccapacity\u201d and \u201cnature\u201d in a person (to be\ndiscussed in Section 5 below). Pure Conversation has been traced to a\nprotest movement against political corruption that erupted toward the\nend of the Han period. The protests were harshly suppressed.\nConsequently, some commentators argue, many intellectuals became\ndisillusioned with the political process. Fearing for their safety\nalso, they turned to, as it were, \u201cpurer\u201d pursuits,\nchanneling their creative energy to art and philosophy, away from the\ntreacherous waters of politics. Culturally, they indulged in wine,\ngames, including Pure Conversation, and outlandish behavior that\nseemed to have been designed expressly to upset the status quo.\nExamples of these will be mentioned below. As Xuanxue\ninformed Pure Conversation philosophically, it is therefore charged\nwith having given rein to a spirit of disengagement that took refuge\nin unproductive intellectual exchanges and certain counter-culture\nexpressions.\n\nNo doubt, many literati in early medieval China found politics to be\nexceedingly corrupt. During this time, eremitic ideals also became\nentrenched in mainstream high culture. Nevertheless, these alone do\nnot afford a full view of the vibrant intellectual landscape. While\nsome scholars had lost faith in the political process, many others\nremained committed to revitalizing the rule of Dao, however it might\nbe defined, and pushed for reforms. While some considered political\ninvolvement distasteful and trained their minds on alternative paths\nof fulfillment such as music and spirituality, others sought to\nreclaim the true teachings of the sages of old, so as to bring about a\nnew sociopolitical awakening. These are not mutually exclusive\npositions, and both sides contributed to the formation of Neo-Daoism.\nIndeed, eremitism in early medieval China seldom translated into\nabandoning the sociopolitical world; in most cases, it signaled\npersonal \u201cpurity\u201d or integrity, a highly valued asset if\nnot a precondition for admission to officialdom. Certainly,\nphilosophical debates need not always be about political reforms;\nnevertheless, especially for young scholars aspiring to make a name\nfor themselves in public life, successes at Pure Conversation could\nreap substantial political dividends. As a general intellectual\nmovement, Xuanxue is united in its attempt to illuminate the\n\u201cdark,\u201d to lay bare the profound mystery of Dao, but it\nencompasses a range of responses to the brave new world that was\npost-Han China.\n\nDuring the heyday of the Han dynasty, the Confucian tradition, as it\nwas interpreted at that time, towered over all the other schools of\nthought. Confidently, it mapped out the structure of the universe and\nthe ways in which the world under heaven ought to be governed. With\nthe decline of the Han dynasty, critiques of Han Confucianism began to\nsurface. To some scholars then, Han Confucianism was not only\npowerless in arresting the growing malaise, but also part of the\nproblem that led to the downfall of the Han dynasty. The critique of\nHan Confucianism, it is important to emphasize, does not necessarily\namount to a rejection of the teachings of Confucius. In fact, with few\nexceptions, Wei-Jin scholars agreed that Confucius was the highest\nsage. It is thus important to clarify that the term\n\u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d does not refer to a kind of\n\u201canti-Confucius\u201d movement. For the majority of\nXuanxue proponents, Confucius had penetrated completely the\nmystery of Dao; it was the misunderstanding and misappropriation of\nConfucian teachings by Han scholars that created difficulties and thus\nrequired rectification.\n\nOne key concern was that scholarship had become an avenue for\nemolument, as a result of which self-interest came to outweigh the\nconcern for truth. This in part explains the emphasis on purity in\nearly medieval Chinese literati culture. Furthermore, Han Confucianism\nattempted to forge an \u201corthodox\u201d front, to explain and put\ninto practice its teachings, and to silence dissent and opposition.\nThe extent of Confucian orthodox control may be open to debate, but\nthere is little question that it sought to exact compliance, which set\nlimits to thought. The classics were restricted to a particular mode\nof interpretation, and non-canonical literature, including Daoist\nworks, were often viewed with suspicion or dismissed outright. In the\ninterest of unity, orthodoxy prescribed closure; but in an age of\ndisunity and disruption, the quest for order charged through\nintellectual barriers with emancipatory fervor.\n\nDuring the Han period, commentaries emerged as the principal medium of\nphilosophic discourse. Methodologically, Han commentaries emphasized\ndetailed explanation of individual words and phrases of the classics.\nThis necessitated heavy specialization, which heightened virtuosity\nbut also opened the door for vain scholastic display and fragmentation\nof learning. One of the most important debates in Xuanxue\nconfronts directly the question of interpretation, which brought\nhermeneutics to the forefront of Chinese philosophy. More will be said\nabout this debate later.\n\nIn this context, a first wave of Xuanxue philosophers arrived\non the scene. They were the brightest of their age, many of whom\nhailed from distinguished families who had held high office for\ngenerations. They were concerned with restoring unity and harmony to\nthe land, not by repudiating the teachings of the sages but by\ninterpreting them anew. They discerned that the great teachers of old\nsuch as Confucius and Laozi shared a profound understanding of Dao,\nand for this reason, the highly partisan approach of Han Confucianism\ncould not but lead to grave misunderstanding of the sage enterprise.\nIn response, they devised new commentarial strategies and fashioned\nnew genres of philosophical discourse, especially the lun,\ncritical discussions, essays or disquisitions that focus on particular\ntopics, which often elicited refutations and in turn, rejoinders. Some\nexamples of this will be discussed in the sections that follow.\n\nOn this view, Confucius and Laozi were both \u201cDaoists,\u201d in\nthe non-partisan sense of the term. Neo-Daoist philosophers set forth\nthe truth of Dao as they understood it in a broad synthesis, bringing\ntogether ontology, cosmology, ethics, and political philosophy, and\nbreaking down partisan divides along the way. Convinced of the unity\nof the classics, they attempted to provide an integral account of the\none \u201cDaoist\u201d tradition. Crossing swords in debate,\ncompeting in offering new readings of the classics, reacting against\nand influenced by one another\u2014in this crisscrossing of ideas,\nXuanxue flourished.\n\nTranslating the term Xuanxue remains a challenge. In view of\nthe ambiguity of \u201cNeo-Daoism,\u201d \u201cDark Learning\u201d\nhas been proposed as an alternative. This is also not entirely\nsatisfactory. Even if it is clear that \u201cdark\u201d does not\nconnote something sinister, it is still problematic because while the\nsubject of the inquiry appears dark or inaccessible to understanding,\nthere is nothing mysterious about the inquiry itself. Innovative and\nabstract in some respects, Xuanxue is nonetheless committed\nto analytic rigor and clarity in explicating the meaning of Dao. The\nculture of disputation has deep roots in Chinese history, and rigorous\ndebates on the classics became prevalent during the Han period, which\nfueled the development of Neo-Daoist philosophy.\n\nCritics of Xuanxue condemned it as \u201cdark,\u201d\nbecause they judged it to be obfuscating and detrimental to the\nflourishing of the Way. They would use phrases like \u201cdark\nwords\u201d (xuanyan) or \u201cdark talk\u201d\n(xuantan) in a pejorative sense, indicating that to them\nXuanxue was nothing but empty talk, convoluted, mystifying\nand misguided. In these contexts, \u201cxuan\u201d may be\ntranslated as \u201cabstruse,\u201d \u201cobscure,\u201d or words\nto that effect. What this suggests is that uniform translation without\nregard to context might be ill advised. Grammatically the word\nxuan functions as a noun in \u201cXuanxue.\u201d\nPerhaps \u201cLearning in the Profound,\u201d \u201cLearning of the\nMysterious Dao,\u201d \u201cInquiry into the Profound\u201d or\nsimilar renderings may be considered, though they seem rather\nbulky.\n\nAs Xuanxue philosophy is seen to offer a fresh approach to\nunderstanding the nature and function of Dao, it has come to be called\nxin daojia (literally, new school of Daoist thought) in some\nmodern Chinese studies, or \u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d in English\ntranslation. In the pages that follow, the terms Xuanxue and\nNeo-Daoism will be used interchangeably in a general sense, as a\nbroad, dynamic intellectual front that flourished during early\nmedieval China, as opposed to a homogeneous \u201cschool\u201d with\nset doctrines. In modern Chinese, Xuanxue is also taken to\nrefer to astrology, geomancy and other popular religious arts, which\nfall outside the scope of this discussion.\n",
