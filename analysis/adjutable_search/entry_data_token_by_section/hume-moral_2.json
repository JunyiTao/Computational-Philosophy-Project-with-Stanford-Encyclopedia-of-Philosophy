    "main_text": "The Influencing Motives of the Will\n3. The Influencing Motives of the Will\n\n\nAccording to Hume, intentional actions are the immediate product of\npassions, in particular the direct passions, including the instincts.\nHe does not appear to allow that any other sort of mental state could,\non its own, give rise to an intentional action except by producing a\npassion, though he does not argue for this.  The motivating passions,\nin their turn, are produced in the mind by specific causes, as we see\nearly in the Treatise where he first explains the distinction\nbetween impressions of sensation and impressions of reflection:\nAn impression first strikes upon the senses, and makes us\nperceive heat or cold, thirst or hunger, pleasure or pain, of some\nkind or other.  Of this impression there is a copy taken by the mind,\nwhich remains after the impression ceases; and this we call an idea.\nThis idea of pleasure or pain, when it returns upon the soul, produces\nthe new impressions of desire and aversion, hope and fear, which may\nproperly be called impressions of reflection, because derived from it.\n(T 1.1.2.2)\n\n\nThus ideas of pleasure or pain are the causes of these motivating\npassions.  Not just any ideas of pleasure or pain give rise to\nmotivating passions, however, but only ideas of those pleasures or\npains we believe exist or will exist (T 1.3.10.3).  More generally,\nthe motivating passions of desire and aversion, hope and fear, joy and\ngrief, and a few others are impressions produced by the occurrence in\nthe mind either of a feeling of pleasure or pain, whether\nphysical or psychological, or of a believed idea of pleasure\nor pain to come (T 2.1.1.4, T 2.3.9.2).  These passions, together with\nthe instincts (hunger, lust, and so on), are all the motivating\npassions that Hume discusses.  \n\n\nThe will, Hume claims, is an immediate effect of pain or pleasure (T\n2.3.1.2) and \u201cexerts itself\u201d when either pleasure or the\nabsence of pain can be attained by any action of the mind or body (T\n2.3.9.7).  The will, however, is merely that impression we feel when\nwe knowingly give rise to an action (T 2.3.1.2); so while Hume is not\nexplicit (and perhaps not consistent) on this matter, he seems not to\nregard the will as itself a (separate) cause of action.  The\ncauses of action he describes are those he has already identified: the\ninstincts and the other direct passions.\n\nHume famously sets himself in opposition to most\nmoral philosophers, ancient and modern, who talk of the combat of\npassion and reason, and who urge human beings to regulate their\nactions by reason and to grant it dominion over their contrary\npassions. He claims to prove that \u201creason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will,\u201d and that reason alone\n\u201ccan never oppose passion in the direction of the will\u201d (T\n413). His view is not, of course, that reason plays no role in the\ngeneration of action; he grants that reason provides information, in\nparticular about means to our ends, which makes a difference to the\ndirection of the will. His thesis is that reason alone cannot\nmove us to action; the impulse to act itself must come from\npassion. The doctrine that reason alone is merely the \u201cslave of\nthe passions,\u201d i.e., that reason pursues knowledge of abstract\nand causal relations solely in order to achieve passions\u2019 goals and\nprovides no impulse of its own, is defended in the\nTreatise, but not in the second Enquiry, although in the\nlatter he briefly asserts the doctrine without argument. Hume gives three\narguments in the Treatise for the motivational\n\u201cinertia\u201d of reason alone.\n\n\nThe first is a largely empirical argument based on the two rational\nfunctions of the understanding. The understanding discovers the\nabstract relations of ideas by demonstration (a process of comparing\nideas and finding congruencies and incongruencies); and it also\ndiscovers the causal (and other probabilistic) relations of objects\nthat are revealed in experience. Demonstrative reasoning is never the\ncause of any action by itself: it deals in ideas rather than\nrealities, and we only find it useful in action when we have some\npurpose in view and intend to use its discoveries to inform our\ninferences about (and so enable us to manipulate) causes and\neffects. Probable or cause-and-effect reasoning does play a role in\ndeciding what to do, but we see that it only functions as an\nauxiliary, and not on its own. When we anticipate pain or pleasure\nfrom some source, we feel aversion or propensity to that object and\n\u201care carry\u2019d to avoid or embrace what will give us\u201d the\npain or pleasure (T 2.3.3.3). Our aversion or propensity makes us seek\nthe causes of the expected source of pain or pleasure, and we use\ncausal reasoning to discover what they are. Once we do, our impulse\nnaturally extends itself to those causes, and we act to avoid or\nembrace them. Plainly the impulse to act does not arise from the\nreasoning but is only directed by it. \u201c\u2019Tis from the prospect of\npain or pleasure that the aversion or propensity arises...\u201d\n(ibid.). Probable reasoning is merely the discovering of causal\nconnections, and knowledge that A causes B never concerns us if we are\nindifferent to A and to B. Thus, neither demonstrative nor probable\nreasoning alone causes action.\n\n\nThe second argument is a corollary of the first. It takes as a premise the conclusion just reached, that reason alone cannot produce an impulse to act. Given that, can reason prevent action or resist passion in controlling the will? To stop a volition or retard the impulse of an existing passion would require a contrary impulse. If reason alone could give rise to such a contrary impulse, it would have an original influence on the will (a\ncapacity to cause intentional action, when unopposed); which,\naccording to the previous argument, it lacks. Therefore reason\nalone cannot resist any impulse to act. Therefore, what offers resistance to our passions  cannot be reason of itself. Hume later proposes that when we restrain\nimprudent or immoral impulses, the contrary impulse comes also from\npassion, but often from a passion so \u201ccalm\u201d that we\nconfuse it with reason.\n\n\nThe third or Representation argument is different in kind. Hume offers\nit initially only to show that a passion cannot be opposed by\nor be contradictory to \u201ctruth and reason\u201d; later (T\n3.1.1.9), he repeats and expands it to argue that volitions and\nactions as well cannot be so. One might suppose he means to give\nanother argument to show that reason alone cannot provide a force to\nresist passion. Yet the Representation Argument is not\nempirical, and does not talk of forces or impulses. Passions (and\nvolitions and actions), Hume says, do not refer to other entities;\nthey are \u201coriginal existence[s],\u201d (T 2.3.3.5),\n\u201coriginal facts and realities\u201d (T3.1.1.9), not mental representations of other things. Since Hume here understands\nrepresentation in terms of copying, he says a passion has no\n\u201crepresentative quality, which renders it a copy of any other\nexistence or modification\u201d (T 2.3.3.5).  Contradiction to truth\nand reason, however, consists in \u201cthe disagreement of ideas,\nconsider\u2019d as copies, with those objects, which they represent\u201d\n(ibid.). Therefore, a passion (or volition or action), not having this\nfeature, cannot be opposed by truth and reason. The\nargument allegedly proves two points: first, that actions cannot be reasonable or unreasonable;  second, that \u201creason cannot immediately prevent or produce any action by contradicting or approving of it\u201d (T3.1.1.10). The point here is\nnot merely the earlier, empirical observation that the rational\nactivity of the understanding does not generate an impulse in the\nabsence of an expectation of pain or pleasure. The main point is that, because\npassions, volitions, and actions have no content suitable for\nassessment by reason, reason cannot assess prospective motives or\nactions as rational or irrational; and therefore reason cannot, by so\nassessing them, create or obstruct them. By contrast,\nreason can assess a potential opinion as rational or\nirrational; and by endorsing the opinion, reason will (that is, we\nwill) adopt it, while by contradicting the opinion, reason will\ndestroy our credence in it. The Representation Argument, then, makes a\npoint a priori about the relevance of the functions of the\nunderstanding to the generation of actions. Interpreters disagree\nabout exactly how to parse this argument, whether it is sound, and its\nimportance to Hume\u2019s project.\n\n\nHume allows that, speaking imprecisely, we often say a passion is\nunreasonable because it arises in response to a mistaken judgment or\nopinion, either that something (a source of pleasure or uneasiness)\nexists, or that it may be obtained or avoided by a certain means. In\njust these two cases a passion may be called unreasonable, but strictly\nspeaking even here it is not the passion but the judgment that is so.\nOnce we correct the mistaken judgment, \u201cour passions yield to our\nreason without any opposition,\u201d so there is still no combat of\npassion and reason (T 2.3.3.7). And there is no other instance of\npassion contrary to reason. Hume famously declaims, \u201c\u2019Tis not\ncontrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the\nscratching of my finger. \u2018Tis not contrary to reason for me to\nchuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or\nperson wholly unknown to me. \u2018Tis as little contrary to reason to\nprefer even my own acknowledg\u2019d lesser good to my greater, and have a\nmore ardent affection for the former than for the latter.\u201d\n(2.3.3.6)\n\n\nInterpreters disagree as to whether Hume is an instrumentalist or a\nskeptic about practical reason. Either way, Hume denies that reason\ncan evaluate the ends people set themselves; only passions can select\nends, and reason cannot evaluate passions.  Instrumentalists\nunderstand the claim that reason is the slave of the passions to allow\nthat reason not only discovers the causally efficacious means to our\nends (a task of theoretical causal reasoning) but also requires us to\ntake them. If Hume regards the failure to take the known means to\none\u2019s end as contrary to reason, then on Hume\u2019s view reason has a\ngenuinely practical aspect: it can classify some actions as\nunreasonable. Skeptical interpreters read Hume, instead, as denying\nthat reason imposes any requirements on action, even the requirement\nto take the known, available means to one\u2019s end. They point to the\nlist of extreme actions that are not contrary to reason (such as\npreferring one\u2019s own lesser good to one\u2019s greater), and to the\nRepresentation Argument, which denies that any passions, volitions, or\nactions are of such a nature as to be contrary to reason. Hume never\nsays explicitly that failing to take the known means to one\u2019s end is\neither contrary to reason or not contrary to reason (it is not one of\nthe extreme cases in his list). The classificatory point in the\nRepresentation Argument favors the reading of Hume as a skeptic about\npractical reason; but that argument is absent from the moral\nEnquiry.\n",
