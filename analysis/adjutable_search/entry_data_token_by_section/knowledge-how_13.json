    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Knowledge-How || Knowledge-how and Belief\n6.1 Knowledge-how and Belief\n\nSome have observed that knowledge-how may differ from propositional\nknowledge in that, whereas the latter plausibly entails belief,\nknowledge-how does not (Dreyfus 1991, 2005; Wallis 2008; Brownstein\n& Michaelson 2016). For example, consider Brownstein &\nMichaelson (2016)\u2019s example. When catching a ball, ball players\nmake anticipatory saccades to shift their gaze ahead of the ball one\nor more times during the course of its flight towards them. These\nplayers know how to catch a ball, and their way of catching a ball\nrequires making anticipatory saccades when watching the ball as it\nfalls. Yet, the players do not believe that making anticipatory\nsaccades is part of how they catch the ball. Rather they believe that\nthey are tracking the ball the whole time. However, from the fact that\nthe subject has false beliefs about how she catches the ball, it does\nnot follow that the subject does not also have correct\nbeliefs about it. So, a natural response is that there is\nsome sense in which the player correctly believes that his\nmanner of tracking the ball has a chance of resulting in success. \n\nWhether this response is compelling might depend on what one takes\nbeliefs to be. On this topic, philosophers widely disagree. On an\n\u201cintellectualist\u201d account of belief, on which believing\nthat p requires the subject to acknowledge that p, it is\nimplausible that the athletes have the relevant belief. But\nintellectualists about knowledge-how might advocate replacing this\nintellectual notion of belief with a less demanding one. According to\na prominent functional characterization of belief, to believe that\np entails being disposed to act in ways that would tend to\nsatisfy one\u2019s desires, whatever they are, in a world in which\np (together with one\u2019s other beliefs) are true\u201d\n(cf. Stalnaker 1984: 15; Stalnaker 2012). Now, suppose that in game\nafter game, Athena catches the ball using a certain method m,\nand that whenever she does so, her behavior is intentional. From this\nit seems to follow that Athena is disposed to perform the actions\nspecified by m. Since, ex hypothesi, m is a way\nof catching the ball, it follows that in all the worlds where she\nperforms these actions, she satisfies her desire of catching the ball\n(or at least is sufficiently likely to do so). By the previous\nfunctional characterization of belief, it follows that Athena believes\nthat m is a way for her to catch the ball. The lesson of this\ndebate might be, following Stalnaker (2012), that intellectualism\nabout knowledge-how is best construed as a form of\nanti-intellectualism about knowledge, belief, and the mental.\n",
