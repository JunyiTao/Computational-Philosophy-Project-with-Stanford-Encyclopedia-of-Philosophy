    "main_text": "Which Groups Count?\n5. Which Groups Count?\n\n\nAccording to the account on offer in this entry, discrimination\nwrongfully imposes relative disadvantages or deprivations on persons\nbased on their membership in some salient social group. But which\nsalient groups count for the purpose of determining whether an act is\nan act of discrimination? This question is at the heart of many heated\npolitical and legal disputes, such as the controversies over the\nrights of gays and trans persons. The question is also central to a\nmatter that is less politically prominent than such disputes but which\nhas important political and philosophical implications. The question\nis whether or not the members of socially dominant groups can, in\nprinciple, be victims of discrimination. It is sometimes said that, in\nthe United States and other Western countries, whites cannot really be\ndiscriminated against on account of their race, because whites are the\nsocially dominant racial group whose members are systematically\nadvantaged by their being white. Thus, in his account of racial\ndiscrimination, Scanlon acknowledges that his view entails that, in\nthe U.S., at least, whites can discriminate against blacks but not\nvice-versa. He holds that discrimination is \u201cunidirectional,\n[applying] only to actions that disadvantage members of a group that\nhas been subject to widespread denigrations and exclusion.\u201d This\nimplication derives from his claim that it is \u201ccrucial to racial\ndiscrimination \u2026 that the prejudicial judgments it involves are\nnot just the idiosyncratic attitudes of a particular agent but are\nwidely shared in the society in question and commonly expressed and\nacted on in ways that have serious consequences\u201d (2008:\n73\u201374). The idea that discrimination is unidirectional is also\nimplied by Fiss\u2019s understanding of discrimination in terms of\n\u201cthe perpetual subordination\u201d of \u201cspecially\ndisadvantaged groups \u2026[whose] political power is severely\ncircumscribed\u201d (1976: 154\u2013155).\n\nAlthough is it undeniable that the members of socially dominant groups\ntypically enjoy a host of unfair advantages, it might be a mistake to\nhold that such persons cannot be victims of discrimination.  Belief in\nthe moral inferiority of the members of other racial groups is not\nexclusive to dominant groups.  Although he subsequently repudiated the\nview, Malcolm X famously regarded whites as a race of devils, and the\nbelief was not some idiosyncrasy of his but rather a doctrine of the\nNation of Islam.  Moreover, subordinate group members are sometimes in\nposition to deny members of a dominant group employment or other\nvaluable opportunities.  When such opportunities are denied based on a\nbelief in the moral inferiority of the dominant group, it would seem\nthat the dominant group members have been discriminated against.\n\n\nScanlon and others might argue that the unidirectional view fits\nbetter than a bidirectional one with the main reason for having a\nconcept of discrimination, viz., to pick out systemic injustices\nlinked to membership in a socially salient group. The discriminatory\nactions of dominant group members typically combine to create such\ninjustices, while actions of subordinate group members wrongly\ndisfavoring on the basis of prejudiced attitudes persons in the\ndominant group fail to combine in that way.\n\n\nHowever, history shows that there are certain kinds of social\nidentities on whose basis persons have often been condemned as moral\ninferiors and victimized by serious systemic injustice. Those\nidentities are tied to race, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity,\nand sexual orientation, among other social categories incorporated\ninto reasonable antidiscrimination principles.  Wrongs done to persons\nin a dominant group on the ground that their group consists of morally\ninferior beings is not the same as the discriminatory wrongs that\ncombine to create serious systemic injustice, but there is more than a\npassing resemblance between the two sets of wrongs.  And shifts in the\nrelative power positions of groups in a society can readily transmute\nwrongs against a dominant group into ones against a subordinate group,\nespecially when the wrongs are driven by beliefs about groups moral\ninferiority/superiority. Perhaps, then, we should say that the central\ncases of discrimination are ones perpetrated against subordinate group\nmembers but that dominant groups members can also be discriminated\nagainst, even though wrongs of the latter sort do not typically\ncombine to form systemic injustices at the broad social level.\n\nPerhaps the most heated of contemporary debates over the question of\nwhich social groups count for purposes of determining whether or not\nan act is an act of discrimination are those concerning sexual\norientation and gender presentation. Many persons hold the view that\nit is discrimination whenever LGBTQ persons are denied the same set of\nlegal rights and powers that heterosexual and cis-gender persons have,\nbut others reject such a view. Philosophers and political theorists\ncan be found on both sides of this divide, although the predominant\nview among such thinkers is that it is discriminatory to deny\nLGBTQ persons the same legal rights and powers that others enjoy\n(Macedo 1996; Corvino 2017; Mikkola 2018; Brief of Philosophy\nProfessors 2019, and, dissenting, Finnis 1997 and Anderson and Girgis\n2017). These debates are ultimately ones of moral principle, resting\non the question of whether government wrongs LGBTQ persons if it\ndenies them any such rights or powers. The concept of discrimination\ncannot, by itself, settle the question, because the concept only tells\nus that it is properly applied to the imposition of wrongful\ndisadvantages on account of salient group membership. The concept does\nnot specify whether it is wrongful to impose disadvantages on persons\non account of their sexual orientation, gender presentation, or any\nother particular social category. Substantive moral reasoning is\nneeded to address the matter (see section 8 below).\n",
