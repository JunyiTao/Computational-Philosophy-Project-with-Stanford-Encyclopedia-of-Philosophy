    "main_text": "Ethics || Knowledge\n2.3 Knowledge\n\nThe human mind, like God, contains ideas. Some of these\nideas\u2014sensory images, qualitative \u201cfeels\u201d (like\npains and pleasures), perceptual data\u2014, and figments of the\nimagination are imprecise qualitative phenomena, being the expression\nin thought of states of the body as it is affected by the bodies\nsurrounding it. Such ideas do not convey adequate and true knowledge\nof the world, but only a relative, partial and subjective picture of\nhow things presently seem to be to the perceiver. There is no\nsystematic order to these perceptions, nor any critical oversight by\nreason. \u201cAs long as the human Mind perceives things from the\ncommon order of nature, it does not have an adequate, but only a\nconfused and mutilated knowledge of itself, of its own Body, and of\nexternal bodies\u201d (IIp29c). Under such circumstances, we are\nsimply determined in our ideas by our fortuitous and haphazard\nencounter with things in the external world. This superficial\nacquaintance will never provide us with knowledge of the essences of\nthose things. In fact, it is an invariable source of falsehood and\nerror. This \u201cknowledge from random experience\u201d is also the\norigin of great delusions, since we\u2014thinking ourselves\nfree\u2014are, in our ignorance, unaware of just how we are\ndetermined by causes.\n\nAdequate ideas, on the other hand, are formed in a rational and\norderly manner, and are necessarily true and revelatory of the\nessences of things. \u201cReason\u201d, the second kind of knowledge\n(after \u201crandom experience\u201d), is the apprehension of the\nessence of a thing through a discursive, inferential procedure.\n\u201cA true idea means nothing other than knowing a thing perfectly,\nor in the best way\u201d(IIp43s). It involves grasping a\nthing\u2019s causal and conceptual connections not just to other\nobjects but, more importantly, to the attributes of God, the infinite\nmodes (the laws of nature) that follow immediately from them, and the\n\u201ccommon notions\u201d that pick out features present in all\nmodes of an attribute. The adequate idea of a thing clearly and\ndistinctly situates its object in all of its causal nexuses and\nconceptual relations, and shows not just that it is, but\nwhat it is and how and why it is. The\nperson who truly knows a thing sees the reasons why the thing was\ndetermined to be and could not have been otherwise. \u201cIt is of\nthe nature of Reason to regard things as necessary, not as\ncontingent\u201d (IIp44). The belief that some thing is accidental or\nspontaneous can be based only on an inadequate grasp of the\nthing\u2019s causal explanation, on a partial and\n\u201cmutilated\u201d familiarity with it. To perceive by way of\nadequate ideas is to perceive the necessity inherent in Nature.\n\nSense experience alone could never provide the information conveyed by\nan adequate idea. The senses present things only as they appear from a\ngiven perspective at a given moment in time. An adequate idea, on the\nother hand, by showing how a thing follows necessarily from one or\nanother of God\u2019s attributes, presents it in its\n\u201ceternal\u201d aspects\u2014sub specie aeternitatis,\nas Spinoza puts it\u2014without any relation to time. \u201cIt is of\nthe nature of Reason to regard things as necessary and not as\ncontingent. And Reason perceives this necessity of things truly, i.e.,\nas it is in itself. But this necessity of things is the very necessity\nof God\u2019s eternal nature. Therefore, it is of the nature of\nReason to regard things under this species of eternity\u201d (IIp44).\nThe third kind of knowledge, intuition, takes what is known by Reason\nand grasps it in a single, perspicacious act of the mind.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s conception of adequate knowledge reveals an unrivaled\noptimism in the cognitive powers of the human being. Not even\nDescartes believed that we could know all of Nature and its innermost\nsecrets with the degree of depth and certainty that Spinoza thought\npossible. Most remarkably, because Spinoza thought that the adequate\nknowledge of any object, and of Nature as a whole, involves a\nknowledge of God\u2019s essence and of how things relate to God and\nits attributes, he also had no scruples about claiming that we can, at\nleast in principle, know God perfectly and adequately. \u201cThe\nknowledge of God\u2019s eternal and infinite essence that each idea\ninvolves is adequate and perfect\u201d (IIp46). \u201cThe human Mind\nhas an adequate knowledge of God\u2019s eternal and infinite\nessence\u201d (IIp47). No other philosopher in history has been\nwilling to make this claim. But, then again, no other philosopher so\nforthrightly identified God with Nature.\n",
