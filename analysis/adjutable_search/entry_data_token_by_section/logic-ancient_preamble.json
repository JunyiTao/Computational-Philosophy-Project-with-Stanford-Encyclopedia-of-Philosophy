    "main_text": "\n\n\nLogic as a discipline starts with the transition from the more or less\nunreflective use of logical methods and argument patterns to the\nreflection on and inquiry into these methods and patterns and their\nelements, including the syntax and semantics of sentences. In Greek\nand Roman antiquity, discussions of some elements of logic and a focus\non methods of inference can be traced back to the late 5th\ncentury BCE.  The Sophists, and later Plato (early 4th c.)\ndisplayed an interest in sentence analysis, truth, and fallacies, and\nEubulides of Miletus (mid-4th c.) is on record as the\ninventor of both the Liar and the Sorites paradox. But logic as a\nfully systematic discipline begins with Aristotle, who systematized\nmuch of the logical inquiry of his predecessors. His main achievements\nwere his theory of the logical interrelation of affirmative and\nnegative existential and universal statements and, based on this\ntheory, his syllogistic, which can be interpreted as a system of\ndeductive inference.  Aristotle\u2019s logic is known as term-logic, since\nit is concerned with the logical relations between terms, such as\n\u2018human being\u2019, \u2018animal\u2019,\n\u2018white\u2019. It shares elements with both set theory and\npredicate logic. Aristotle\u2019s successors in his school, the Peripatos,\nnotably Theophrastus and Eudemus, widened the scope of deductive\ninference and improved some aspects of Aristotle\u2019s logic.\n\n\nIn the Hellenistic period, and apparently independent of Aristotle\u2019s\nachievements, the logician Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo (see\nthe entry\n Dialectical school)\n worked out the beginnings of a logic that took propositions, rather\nthan terms, as its basic elements. They influenced the second major\ntheorist of logic in antiquity, the Stoic Chrysippus\n(mid-3rd c.), whose main achievement is the development of\na propositional logic, crowned by a deductive system. Regarded by many\nin antiquity as the greatest logician, he was innovative in a large\nnumber of topics that are central to contemporary formal and\nphilosophical logic. The many close similarities between Chrysippus\u2019\nphilosophical logic and that of Gottlob Frege are especially\nstriking. Chrysippus\u2019 Stoic successors systematized his logic, and\nmade some additions.\n\n\nThe development of logic from c. 100 BCE to c. 250 CE remains mostly\nin the dark, but there can be no doubt that logic was one of the\ntopics regularly studied and researched. At some point Peripatetics\nand Stoics began taking notice of each other\u2019s logical systems, and we\nwitness some conflation of both terminologies and theories.\nAristotelian syllogistic became known as \u2018categorical\nsyllogistic\u2019 and the Peripatetic adaptation of Stoic syllogistic\nas \u2018hypothetical syllogistic\u2019. In the 2nd\ncentury CE, Galen attempted to synthesize the two traditions; he also\nprofessed to have introduced a third kind of syllogism, the\n\u2018relational syllogism\u2019, which apparently was meant to help\nformalize mathematical reasoning. The attempt of some Middle\nPlatonists (1st c. BCE\u20132nd c. CE) to claim\na specifically Platonic logic failed, and in its stead, the\nNeo-Platonists (3rd\u20136th c. CE) adopted a\nscholasticized version of Aristotelian logic as their own. In the\nmonumental\u2014if rarely creative\u2014volumes of the Greek\ncommentators on Aristotle\u2019s logical works we find elements of Stoic\nand later Peripatetic logic as well as Platonism, and ancient\nmathematics and rhetoric. Much the same holds for the Latin logical\nwritings by Apuleius (2nd c. CE) and Boethius\n(6th c. CE), which pave the way for Aristotelian logic,\nthus supplemented, to enter the Medieval era.\n",
