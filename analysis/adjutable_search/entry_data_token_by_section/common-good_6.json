    "main_text": "Central Features of the Common Good || A Privileged Class of Common Interests\n4.3 A Privileged Class of Common Interests\n\nA conception of the common good will define a privileged class of\nabstract interests. Citizens are understood to have a relational\nobligation to create and maintain certain facilities because these\nfacilities serve the relevant interests. The interests in the\nprivileged class are \u201ccommon\u201d in the sense that every\ncitizen is understood to have these interests to a similar\n degree.[11]\n The interests are \u201cabstract\u201d in the sense that they may\nbe served by a variety of material, cultural or institutional\nfacilities. A wide variety of interests figure prominently in the\nliterature, including: the interest in taking part in the most\nchoiceworthy way of life (Aristotle Pol.\n1323a14\u20131325b31); the interest in bodily security and property\n(e.g., Locke 1698; Rousseau 1762b); the interest in living a\nresponsible and industrious private life (Smith 1776); the\ninterest in a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties (Rawls\n1971 and 1993); the interest in a fair opportunity to reach the more\nattractive positions in society (Rawls 1971); and the interest in\nsecurity and welfare, where these interests are understood as socially\nrecognized needs that are subject to ongoing political determination\n(Walzer 1983).\n",
