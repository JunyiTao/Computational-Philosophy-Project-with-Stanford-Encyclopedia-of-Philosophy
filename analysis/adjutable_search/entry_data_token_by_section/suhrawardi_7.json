    "main_text": "Physics || Epistemology\n3.2 Epistemology\n\nAt the heart of Suhrawardi\u2019s epistemological concerns lie two\nimportant components of his ishraqi philosophy of lights: the\nconcepts of \u2018self-awareness\u2019 (shu\u2018ur\nbi-l-dhat) and \u2018knowledge by presence\u2019\n(\u2018ilm huduri) (PI, \u00a7\u00a7114\u20137).\nWhat is at stake is the nature of the acquisition of knowledge and its\nontological underpinning. He begins by exploring and questioning some\nof the issues raised by the hypothetical thought experiment of the\n\u2018flying\u2019 or \u2018suspended\u2019 person found in\nAvicenna\u2019s Discussions and his Notes on\nAristotle\u2019s De anima, and his treatments of the soul in\nthe Cure and Salvation. In Intimations, for\ninstance, he criticizes and then rejects Avicenna\u2019s Peripatetic\n\u2018representational\u2019 epistemology that conceives acquisition\nof knowledge by means of a \u2018representation\u2019 or a\n\u2018form\u2019 of what is known in the knower (Kaukua 2015,\n106\u201317). He rejects it as a proof for the existence of the\nimmaterial soul, claiming that the relation enjoyed by the (material)\nbody/(immaterial) soul is a \u201cmore intimate relationship of\n\u2018presence\u2019 (hudur)\u201d, since\n\u2018presence\u2019 now connects (immaterial) intellection and\ninternal (material/brain) senses activities. This experiential\nevidence would serve as proof for the existence of the soul\n\nIn his Philosophy of Illumination, he deals primarily with\n\u2018apperception\u2019 (which now replaces representation or\nform). He analyzes the notions of apperception and self-awareness as\nhe explores this pre-logical mode of perception distinct from\nintellection. He discusses the primary awareness of the soul\u2019s\nexistence, its self-identity, the unmediated character of this\nparticular type of knowledge and issues of individuation. He develops\nhis epistemological theory by providing various arguments to\ndemonstrate the existence of a type of knowledge that is self-evident,\ninnate and unmediated through any type of abstraction or\nrepresentation of forms, whether it be through an image, a form, a\nnotion or an attribute of the self (Marcotte 2006).\n\nThe perception of pain becomes paradigmatic of the type of\napperception or awareness he envisions when discussion self- awareness\nas unmediated perception, i.e., a non-discursive, non-conceptual and\nnon-propositional type of knowledge that, nonetheless, constitutes a\nmode of knowing distinct from discursive knowledge. Similar to pain,\nself-awareness provides yet another illustration of this type of\nepistemic process. In this manner, Suhrawardi is able to explain the\nknowledge of both an individual self-awareness of its self and the\nawareness of other external objects of knowledge. The unmediated\nnature of this process characterizes both the soul\u2019s\nself-awareness and the soul\u2019s awareness or knowledge of external\nobjects of knowledge, such as dominating (intelligible)\nlight-entities, and even provides the conditions for possible glimpses\nof the Light of Lights, God, it may catch (Suh. 1993a, 72\u20133,\n487\u20139; cf. Kaukua 2015, 130\u20131). \n\nThe concept of self-awareness informs the epistemological and\nontological aspects of Suhrawardi\u2019s metaphysic of lights.\nBuilding upon a basic type of self-awareness found in Avicenna (but\nwithout its inference to the substantiality of the human soul) and the\nselfhood (of the contemplative soul) of the Arabic Plotinus,\nSuhrawardi introduces a pre-cognitive level of self-consciousness or\nself-awareness, logically prior to any distinction between subject and\nobject (Kaukua 2011, 141\u20134). Self-awareness of human beings is\nequated with the self-awareness that incorporeal lights possess and\nshare. Suhrawardi writes, \u201cIt has been shown that your ego\n(ana\u2019iyya) is an incorporeal light, that it is\nself-conscious, and that the incorporeal lights do not differ in their\nrealities. Thus, all the incorporeal lights must apprehend their own\nessences (dhat), since that which is necessarily true of a\nthing must also be true of that which has the same reality\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7127; cf. Kaukua 2011, 150). He thus distinguishes\nthe \u2018object of cognition\u2019 from the \u2018subject\u2019,\nthe latter embodied in the \u2018I-ness\u2019\n(ana\u2019iyya) coined by Suhrawardi to identify the\n\u201cmode of being proper to a cognitive subject\u201d;\nself-awareness, as mere apprehension and existence, is now\ndistinguished from the awareness of separate objects (Kaukua 2015,\n113; Marcotte 2006). \n\nIt is upon self-awareness that Suhrawardi builds his\n\u201crevisionist concept of knowledge as presence\u201d (Kaukua\n2015, 125\u201342). In his Intimations, the\n\u2018Plotinian\u2019 (cf. Enneads V 3.6) Aristotle figure\nof Suhrawardi\u2019s famous \u2018dream-vision \u2018 provides an\nillustrious example of what constitutes real knowledge based on\nimmediate and intuitive knowledge: \u201creturn to your self\n(nafs)\u201d (1993a, 70), that is, knowledge one obtains\nthrough one\u2019s own soul. This Aristotle continues to explain how\none knows, introducing intellection as \u201cthe presence\n(hudur) of a thing for a self (dhat)\u201d,\npresence (hudur) or appearance (zuhur) being a\n\u201cfunction of luminosity\u201d. These passages of\nIntimations introduce central elements of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nknowledge by presence (Suh. 1993a, 71\u20134; cf. Walbridge 2000,\n225\u20139; Eichner 2001, 127\u201340; Kaukua 2013, 310\u20137,\n2015, 127\u201333; Fanaei Eshkevari, 1996). \n\nIn Suhrawardi\u2019s \u2018science of lights\u2019, the object of\napperception \u2014 light \u2014 cannot be known discursively, but\nonly through an immediate presence or awareness of its luminosity, as\nnot to fall into reification. Mystical vision and contemplation\noperate through this intuitive process of knowing metaphysical lights.\nIndividuals achieve such states through spiritual and ascetic\npractices that enable them to detach themselves from the darknesses of\nthe world in their quest for the apperception of those lights.\nIntuitive knowledge (dhawq) thus constitutes a superior means\nof accessing the luminous reality and the divine realm of metaphysical\ntruths. \n\nSuhrawardi appears to spiritualize Avicenna\u2019s Peripatetic\nepistemology with a notably Platonic reading, now that the access to\nthe ultimate reality is guaranteed through divine photic illumination.\nHis classification of learned men according to their respective merits\nin discursive (philosophy) and intuitive (mystical) knowledge is\nrevealing. For some, like Qutb al-Din Shirazi, whereas the\nPeripatetics had extolled intellection, Suhrawardi brings direct\nintuition (dhawq) or mystical contemplation (heightened by\nascetic components) to the forefront, as an alternative \u2014 albeit\nmore reliable \u2014 foundation of certainty, where this presence can\nbe achieved through intuitive apprehension or contemplative vision\n(mushahada) in order to access true reality, following\ncontinuous practice of spiritual exercises. \n\nDirect intuition (dhawq) or mystical contemplation plays a\npredominant role, even for prophets. Prophetic knowledge relies on the\nfunctions of the faculty of imagination, i.e., its mimetic function\nand its role in the particularization of universal truths. Prophecy\nbecomes the \u2018direct\u2019 experience of the world of lights.\nSuhrawardi also introduces an independent \u2018world of\nimages\u2019 to account for the ability of prophets and other gifted\nindividuals to access divine metaphysical realms where imaginable\nforms already exist. Such individuals are either commissioned or\nuncommissioned to receive and transmit God\u2019s message, the\nprophets being those who are among the privileged commissioned. Direct\nintuition lies at the heart of Suhrawardi\u2019s prophetology,\ninasmuch as only the most perfect sage (hakim) with intuitive\nphilosophy (muta\u2019allih) who witnesses those truths,\nwhether he be a prophet or not, deserves God\u2019s viceregency\n(khilafa), by being either a living proof or in occultation.\nIndividuals who have access to those metaphysical lights can be\ninvested with this viceregency, depending on the degree of their\nreceptivity and the purity of their hearts (PI, \u00a75).\n\n\nOn the whole, however, the epistemic process by which mystics such as\nAbu Yazid al-Bistami (d.874), Sahl al-Tustari (d.896) and Hallaj\n(d.912), sages such as Zarathustra and Empedocles, philosophers such\nas Pythagoras and Plato, or Suhrawardi himself have all had access to\nthose metaphysical truths and divine realms remains quite similar to\nthe process by which prophets have accessed the same divine and\nmetaphysical truths. Liberated from the enslavement of the material\nworld, their Isfahbad-light souls become receptive to illumination and\nperceive truths similar to those perceived by prophets. Prophetic and\nmystical knowledge only occur once the human soul is able to conjoin\nwith those metaphysical lights. The soul is able to acquire a luminous\nand theurgic power, mediated by the active imagination which\nexistentiates images and forms that have been reflected, in a\nmirror-like manner, onto it (Sinai 2015). It can imitate and reproduce\nforms that it has received from non-sensible realms, as it\nshort-circuits all incoming external and sensible data. The faculty of\nactive imagination then projects those matters onto the \u2018common\nsense\u2019 that provides a sensible form to those divine\nmetaphysical realities that they did not originally possess. \n",
