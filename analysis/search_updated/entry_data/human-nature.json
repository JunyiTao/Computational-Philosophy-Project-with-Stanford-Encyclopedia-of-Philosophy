    "preamble": "\n\nTalk of human nature is a common feature of moral and political\ndiscourse among people on the street and among philosophers, political\nscientists and sociologists. This is largely due to the widespread\nassumption that true descriptive or explanatory claims making use of\nthe concept of human nature have, or would have, considerable\nnormative significance. Some think that human nature excludes the\npossibility of certain forms of social organisation\u2014for example,\nthat it excludes any broadly egalitarian society. Others make the\nstronger claim that a true normative ethical theory has to be built on\nprior knowledge of human nature. Still others believe that there are\nspecific moral prohibitions concerning the alteration of, or\ninterference in, the set of properties that make up human nature.\nFinally, there are those who argue that the normative significance\nderives from the fact that merely deploying the concept is typically,\nor even necessarily, pernicious.\n\nAlongside such varying and frequently conflicting normative uses of\nthe expression \u201chuman nature\u201d, there are serious\ndisagreements concerning the concept\u2019s content and explanatory\nsignificance\u2014the starkest being whether the expression\n\u201chuman nature\u201d refers to anything at all. Some reasons\ngiven for saying there is no human nature are anthropological,\ngrounded in views concerning the relationship between natural and\ncultural features of human life. Other reasons given are biological,\nderiving from the character of the human species as, like other\nspecies, an essentially historical product of evolution. Whether these\nreasons justify the claim that there is no human nature depends, at\nleast in part, on what it is exactly that the expression is supposed\nto be picking out. Many contemporary proposals differ significantly in\ntheir answers to this question.\n\nUnderstanding the debates around the philosophical use of the\nexpression \u201chuman nature\u201d requires clarity on the reasons\nboth for (1) adopting specific adequacy conditions for the\nterm\u2019s use and for (2) accepting particular substantial claims\nmade within the framework thus adopted. One obstacle to such clarity\nis historical: we have inherited from the beginnings of Western\nphilosophy, via its Medieval reception, the idea that talk of human\nnature brings into play a number of different, but related claims. One\nsuch set of claims derives from different meanings of the Greek\nequivalents of the term \u201cnature\u201d. This bundle of claims,\nwhich can be labelled the traditional package, is a set of\nadequacy conditions for any substantial claim that uses the\nexpression \u201chuman nature\u201d. The beginnings of Western\nphilosophy have also handed down to us a number of such\nsubstantial claims. Examples are that humans are\n\u201crational animals\u201d or \u201cpolitical animals\u201d. We\ncan call these claims the traditional slogans. The\ntraditional package is a set of specifications of how claims along the\nlines of the traditional slogans are to be understood, i.e., what it\nmeans to claim that it is \u201chuman nature\u201d to be, for\nexample, a rational animal.\n\nVarious developments in Western thought have cast doubt both on the\ncoherence of the traditional package and on the possibility that the\nadequacy conditions for the individual claims can be fulfilled.\nForemost among these developments are the Enlightenment rejection of\nteleological metaphysics, the Historicist emphasis on the significance\nof culture for understanding human action and the Darwinian\nintroduction of history into biological kinds. This entry aims to help\nclarify the adequacy conditions for claims about human nature, the\nsatisfiability of such conditions and the reasons why the truth of\nclaims with the relevant conditions might seem important. It proceeds\nin five steps. Section 1 unpacks the traditional package, paying\nparticular attention to the importance of Aristotelian themes and to\nthe distinction between the scientific and participant perspectives\nfrom which human nature claims can be raised. Section 2 explains why\nevolutionary biology raises serious problems both for the coherence of\nthis package and for the truth of its individual component claims.\nSections 3 and 4 then focus on attempts to secure scientific\nconceptions of human nature in the face of the challenge from\nevolutionary biology. The entry concludes with a discussion of\naccounts of human nature developed from a participant perspective, in\nparticular accounts that, in spite of the evolutionary challenge, are\ntaken to have normative consequences.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. \u201cHumans\u201d, Slogans and the Traditional Package\n1.1 \u201cHumans\u201d\n\nBefore we begin unpacking, it should be noted that the adjective\n\u201chuman\u201d is polysemous, a fact that often goes unnoticed in\ndiscussions of human nature, but makes a big difference to both the\nmethodological tractability and truth of claims that employ the\nexpression. The natural assumption may appear to be that we are\ntalking about specimens of the biological species Homo\nsapiens, that is, organisms belonging to the taxon that split\nfrom the rest of the hominin lineage an estimated 150,000 years ago.\nHowever, certain claims seem to be best understood as at least\npotentially referring to organisms belonging to various older species\nwithin the subtribe Homo, with whom specimens of Homo\nsapiens share properties that have often been deemed significant\n(Sterelny 2018: 114).\n\nOn the other hand, the \u201cnature\u201d that is of interest often\nappears to be that of organisms belonging to a more restricted group.\nThere may have been a significant time lag between the speciation of\nanatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) and the evolution\nof behaviourally modern humans, i.e., human populations whose life\nforms involved symbol use, complex tool making, coordinated hunting\nand increased geographic range. Behavioural modernity\u2019s\ndevelopment is often believed only to have been completed by 50,000\nyears ago. If, as is sometimes claimed, behavioural modernity requires\npsychological capacities for planning, abstract thought,\ninnovativeness and symbolism (McBrearty & Brooks 2000: 492) and if\nthese were not yet widely or sufficiently present for several tens of\nthousands of years after speciation, then it may well be\nbehaviourally, rather than anatomically modern humans whose\n\u201cnature\u201d is of interest to many theories. Perhaps the\nrestriction might be drawn even tighter to include only contemporary\nhumans, that is, those specimens of the species who, since the\nintroduction of agriculture around 12,000 years ago, evolved the\nskills and capacities necessary for life in large sedentary,\nimpersonal and hierarchical groups (Kappeler, Fichtel, & van\nSchaik 2019: 68).\n\nIt was, after all, a Greek living less than two and a half millennia\nago within such a sedentary, hierarchically organised population\nstructure, who could have had no conception of the prehistory of the\nbeings he called anthr\u00f4poi, whose thoughts on their\n\u201cnature\u201d have been decisive for the history of\nphilosophical reflection on the subject. It seems highly likely that,\nwithout the influence of Aristotle, discussions of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d would not be structured as they are until today.\n1.2 Unpacking the Traditional Package\n\nWe can usefully distinguish four types of claim that have been\ntraditionally made using the expression \u201chuman nature\u201d. As\na result of a particular feature of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy, to\nwhich we will come in a moment, these four claims are associated with\nfive different uses of the expression. Uses of the first type seem to\nhave their origin in Plato; uses of the second, third and fourth type\nare Aristotelian; and, although uses of the fifth type have\nhistorically been associated with Aristotle, this association seems to\nderive from a misreading in the context of the religiously motivated\nMediaeval reception of his philosophy.\n\nA first, thin, contrastive use of the expression \u201chuman\nnature\u201d is provided by the application of a thin, generic\nconcept of nature to humans. In this minimal variant, nature is\nunderstood in purely contrastive or negative terms. Phusis is\ncontrasted in Plato and Aristotle with techn\u0113, where the\nlatter is the product of intention and a corresponding intervention of\nagency. If the entire cosmos is taken to be the product of divine\nagency, then, as Plato argued (Nadaf 2005: 1ff.), conceptualisations\nof the cosmos as natural in this sense are mistaken. Absent divine\nagency, the types of agents whose intentions are relevant for the\nstatus of anything as natural are human agents. Applied to humans,\nthen, this concept of nature picks out human features that are not the\nresults of human intentional action. Thus understood, human nature is\nthe set of human features or processes that remain after subtraction\nof those picked out by concepts of the non-natural, concepts such as\n\u201cculture\u201d, \u201cnurture\u201d, or\n\u201csocialisation\u201d.\n\nA second component in the package supplies the thin concept\nwith substantial content that confers on it explanatory power.\nAccording to Aristotle, natural entities are those that contain in\nthemselves the principle of their own production or development, in\nthe way that acorns contain a blueprint for their own realisation as\noak trees (Physics 192b; Metaphysics 1014b). The\n\u201cnature\u201d of natural entities thus conceptualised is a\nsubset of the features that make up their nature in the first sense.\nThe human specification of this explanatory concept of nature aims to\npick out human features that similarly function as blueprints for\nsomething like a fully realised form. According to Aristotle, for all\nanimals that blueprint is \u201cthe soul\u201d, that is, the\nintegrated functional capacities that characterise the fully developed\nentity. The blueprint is realised when matter, i.e., the body, has\nattained the level of organisation required to instantiate the\nanimal\u2019s living functions (Charles 2000: 320ff.; Lennox 2009:\n356).\n\nA terminological complication is introduced here by the fact that the\nfully developed form of an entity is itself also frequently designated\nas its \u201cnature\u201d (Aristotle, Physics 193b;\nPolitics 1252b). In Aristotle\u2019s teleological\nmetaphysics, this is the entity\u2019s end, \u201cthat for the sake\nof which a thing is\u201d (Metaphysics 1050a; Charles 2000:\n259). Thus, a human\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d, like that of any\nother being, may be either the features in virtue of which it is\ndisposed to develop to a certain mature form or, thirdly, the\nform to which it is disposed to develop.\n\nImportantly, the particularly prominent focus on the idea of a fully\ndeveloped form in Aristotle\u2019s discussions of humans derives from\nits dual role. It is not only the form to the realisation of which\nhuman neonates are disposed; it is also the form that mature members\nof the species ought to realise (Politics 1253a).\nThis normative specification is the fourth component of the\ntraditional package. The second, third and fourth uses of\n\u201cnature\u201d are all in the original package firmly anchored\nin a teleological metaphysics. One question for systematic claims\nabout human nature is whether any of these components remain plausible\nif we reject a teleology firmly anchored in theology (Sedley 2010:\n5ff.).\n\nA fifth and last component of the package that has\ntraditionally been taken to have been handed down from antiquity is\nclassificatory. Here, the property or set of properties named by the\nexpression \u201chuman nature\u201d is that property or property set\nin virtue of the possession of which particular organisms belong to a\nparticular biological taxon: what we now identify as the species taxon\nHomo sapiens. This is human nature typologically\nunderstood.\n\nThis, then, is the traditional package:\n\n\nComponent\nVariant of human nature \n\nTP1\ncontrastive \n\nTP2\nblueprint explanatory \n\nTP3\nexplanatorily\u00a0teleological \n\nTP4\nnormatively\u00a0teleological \n\nTP5\nclassificatory or taxonomic \n\n1.3 Essentialisms\n\nThe sort of properties that have traditionally been taken to support\nthe classificatory practices relevant to TP5 are intrinsic to the\nindividual organisms in question. Moreover, they have been taken to be\nable to fulfil this role in virtue of being necessary and\nsufficient for the organism\u2019s membership of the species,\ni.e., \u201cessential\u201d in one meaning of the term. This view of\nspecies membership, and the associated view of species themselves, has\nbeen influentially dubbed \u201ctypological thinking\u201d (Mayr\n1959 [1976: 27f.]; cf. Mayr 1982: 260) and \u201cessentialism\u201d\n(Hull 1965: 314ff.; cf. Mayr 1968 [1976: 428f.]). The former\ncharacterisation involves an epistemological focus on the\nclassificatory procedure, the latter a metaphysical focus on the\nproperties thus singled out. Ernst Mayr claimed that the\nclassificatory approach originates in Plato\u2019s theory of forms,\nand, as a result, involves the further assumption that the properties\nare unchanging. According to David Hull, its root cause is the attempt\nto fit the ontology of species taxa to an Aristotelian theory of\ndefinition.\n\nThe theory of definition developed in Aristotle\u2019s logical works\nassigns entities to a genus and distinguishes them from other members\nof the genus, i.e., from other \u201cspecies\u201d, by their\ndifferentiae (Topics 103b). The procedure is descended from\nthe \u201cmethod of division\u201d of Plato, who provides a crude\nexample as applied to humans, when he has the Eleatic Stranger in the\nStatesman characterise them as featherless bipeds (266e).\nHull and many scholars in his wake (Dupr\u00e9 2001: 102f.) have\nclaimed that this simple schema for picking out essential conditions\nfor species membership had a seriously deleterious effect on\nbiological taxonomy until Darwin (cf. Winsor 2006).\n\nHowever, there is now widespread agreement that Aristotle was no\ntaxonomic essentialist (Balme 1980: 5ff.; Mayr 1982: 150ff.; Balme\n1987: 72ff.; Ereshefsky 2001: 20f; Richards 2010: 21ff.; Wilkins 2018:\n9ff.). First, the distinction between genus and differentiae was for\nAristotle relative to the task at hand, so that a\n\u201cspecies\u201d picked out in this manner could then count as\nthe genus for further differentiation. Second, the Latin term\n\u201cspecies\u201d, a translation of the Greek eidos, was\na logical category with no privileged relationship to biological\nentities; a prime example in the Topics is the species\njustice, distinguished within the genus virtue (143a). Third, in a key\nmethodological passage, Parts of Animals, I.2\u20133\n(642b\u2013644b), Aristotle explicitly rejects the method of\n\u201cdichotomous division\u201d, which assigns entities to a genus\nand then seeks a single differentia, as inappropriate to the\nindividuation of animal kinds. Instead, he claims, a multiplicity of\ndifferentiae should be brought to bear. He emphasises this point in\nrelation to humans (644a).\n\nAccording to Pierre Pellegrin and David Balme, Aristotle did not seek\nto establish a taxonomic system in his biological works (Pellegrin\n1982 [1986: 113ff.]; Balme 1987, 72). Rather, he simply accepted the\neveryday common sense partitioning of the animal world (Pellegrin 1982\n[1986: 120]; Richards 2010: 24; but cf. Charles 2000: 343ff.). If this\nis correct, Aristotle didn\u2019t even ask after the conditions for\nbelonging to the species Homo sapiens. So he wasn\u2019t\nproposing any particular answer, and specifically not the\n\u201cessentialist\u201d answer advanced by TP5. In as far as such\nan answer has been employed in biological taxonomy (cf. Winsor 2003),\nits roots appear to lie in Neoplatonic, Catholic misinterpretations of\nAristotle (Richards 2010: 34ff.; Wilkins 2018: 22ff.). Be that as it\nmay, the fifth use of \u201chuman nature\u201d transported by\ntradition\u2014to pick out essential conditions for an\norganism\u2019s belonging to the species\u2014is of eminent\ninterest. The systematic concern behind Mayr and Hull\u2019s\nhistorical claims is that accounts of the form of TP5 are incompatible\nwith evolutionary theory. We shall look at this concern in\n section 2\n of this entry.\n\nBecause the term \u201cessentialism\u201d recurs with different\nmeanings in discussions of human nature and because some of the\ntheoretical claims thus summarised are assumed to be Aristotelian in\norigin, it is worth spending a moment here to register what claims can\nbe singled out by the expression. The first, purely\nclassificatory conception just discussed should be distinguished from\na second view that is also frequently labelled\n\u201cessentialist\u201d and which goes back to Locke\u2019s\nconcept of \u201creal essence\u201d (1689: III, iii, 15). According\nto essentialism thus understood, an essence is the intrinsic feature\nor features of an entity that fulfils or fulfil a dual role: firstly,\nof being that in virtue of which something belongs to a kind and,\nsecondly, of explaining why things of that kind typically have a\nparticular set of observable features. Thus conceived,\n\u201cessence\u201d has both a classificatory and an explanatory\nfunction and is the core of a highly influential,\n\u201cessentialist\u201d theory of natural kinds, developed in the\nwake of Kripke\u2019s and Putnam\u2019s theories of reference.\n\nAn account of human nature that is essentialist in this sense would\ntake the nature of the human natural kind to be a set of\nmicrostructural properties that have two roles: first, they constitute\nan organism\u2019s membership of the species Homo sapiens.\nSecond, they are causally responsible for the organism manifesting\nmorphological and behavioural properties typical of species members.\nParadigms of entities with such natures or essences are chemical\nelements. An example is the element with the atomic number 79, the\nmicrostructural feature that accounts for surface properties of gold\nsuch as yellowness. Applied to organisms, it seems that the relevant\nexplanatory relationship will be developmental, the microstructures\nproviding something like a blueprint for the properties of the mature\nindividual. Kripke assumed that some such blueprint is the\n\u201cinternal structure\u201d responsible for the typical\ndevelopment of tigers as striped, carnivorous quadrupeds (Kripke 1972\n[1980: 120f.]).\n\nAs the first, pseudo-Aristotelian version of essentialism illustrates,\nthe classificatory and explanatory components of what we might call\n\u201cKripkean essentialism\u201d can be taken apart. Thus,\n\u201chuman nature\u201d can also be understood in exclusively\nexplanatory terms, viz. as the set of microstructural properties\nresponsible for typical human morphological and behavioural features.\nIn such an account, the ability to pick out the relevant organisms is\nsimply presupposed. As we shall see in\n section 4\n of this entry, accounts of this kind have been popular in the\ncontemporary debate. The subtraction of the classificatory function of\nthe properties in these conceptions has generally seemed to warrant\nwithholding from them the label \u201cessentialist\u201d. However,\nbecause some authors have still seen the term as applicable\n(Dupr\u00e9 2001: 162), we might think of such accounts as\nconstituting a third, weak or deflationary variant of\nessentialism.\n\nSuch purely explanatory accounts are descendants of the second use of\n\u201chuman nature\u201d in the traditional package, the difference\nbeing that they don\u2019t usually presuppose some notion of the\nfully developed human form. However, where some such presupposition is\nmade, there are stronger grounds for talking of an\n\u201cessentialist\u201d account. Elliott Sober has argued that the\nkey to essentialism is not classification in terms of necessary and\nsufficient conditions, but the postulation of some \u201cprivileged\nstate\u201d, to the realisation of which specimens of a species tend,\nas long as no extrinsic factors \u201cinterfere\u201d (Sober 1980:\n358ff.). Such a dispositional-teleological conception, dissociated\nfrom classificatory ambitions, would be a fourth form of\nessentialism. Sober rightly associates such an account with Aristotle,\nciting Aristotle\u2019s claims in his zoological writings that\ninterfering forces are responsible for deviations, i.e., morphological\ndifferences, both within and between species. A contemporary account\nof human nature with this structure will be discussed in\n section 4.\n\nA fifth and final form of essentialism is even more clearly\nAristotelian. Here, an explicitly normative status is conferred on the\nset of properties to the development of which human organisms tend.\nFor normative essentialism, \u201cthe human essence\u201d or\n\u201chuman nature\u201d is a normative standard for the evaluation\nof organisms belonging to the species. Where the first, third and\nfourth uses of the expression have tended to be made with critical\nintent (for defensive exceptions, see Charles 2000: 348ff.; Walsh\n2006; Devitt 2008; Boulter 2012), this fifth use is more often a\nself-ascription (e.g., Nussbaum 1992). It is intended to emphasise\nmetaethical claims of a specific type. According to such claims, an\norganism\u2019s belonging to the human species entails or in some way\ninvolves the applicability to the organism of moral norms that ground\nin the value of the fully developed human form. According to one\nversion of this thought, humans ought be, or ought to be enabled to\nbe, rational because rationality is a key feature of the fully\ndeveloped human form. Such normative-teleological accounts of human\nnature will be the focus of\n section 5.2.\n\nWe can summarise the variants of essentialism and their relationship\nto the components of the traditional package as follows:\n\n\nType of essentialism\nRelationship to the traditional package \n\npurely classificatory\nequivalent to TP5 \n\npurely explanatory\nunspecific version of TP2 \n\nexplanatory-classificatory\ncombines TP5 with an unspecific version of TP2 \n\nexplanatorily teleological\nequivalent to TP3 \n\nnormatively teleological\nequivalent to TP4 \n\n\nSection 2\n and\n section 5\n of this entry deal with the purely classificatory and the normative\nteleological conceptions of human nature respectively, and with the\nassociated types of essentialism.\n Section 3\n discusses attempts to downgrade TP5, moving from essential to merely\ncharacteristic properties.\n Section 4\n focuses on accounts of an explanatory human nature, both on attempts\nto provide a modernized version of the teleological blueprint model\n (\u00a74.1)\n and on explanatory conceptions with deflationary intent relative to\nthe claims of TP2 and TP3\n (\u00a74.2\n and\n \u00a74.3).\n1.4 On the Status of the Traditional Slogan\n\nThe traditional package specifies a set of conditions some or all of\nwhich substantial claims about \u201chuman nature\u201d are supposed\nto meet. Before we turn to the systematic arguments central to\ncontemporary debates on whether such conditions can be met, it will be\nhelpful to spend a moment considering one highly influential\nsubstantial claim. Aristotle\u2019s writings prominently contain two\nsuch claims that have been handed down in slogan form. The first is\nthat the human being (more accurately: \u201cman\u201d) is an animal\nthat is in some important sense social (\u201czoon politikon\u201d,\nHistory of Animals 487b; Politics 1253a;\nNicomachean Ethics 1169b). According to the second,\n\u201che\u201d is a rational animal (Politics 1253a, where\nAristotle doesn\u2019t actually use the traditionally ascribed\nslogan, \u201czoon logon echon\u201d).\n\nAristotle makes both claims in very different theoretical contexts, on\nthe one hand, in his zoological writings and, on the other, in his\nethical and political works. This fact, together with the fact that\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature and his practical philosophy\nare united by a teleological metaphysics, may make it appear obvious\nthat the slogans are biological claims that provide a foundation for\nnormative claims in ethics and politics. The slogans do indeed\nfunction as foundations in the Politics and the\nNicomachean Ethics respectively (on the latter, see\n section 5\n of this entry). It is, however, unclear whether they are to be\nunderstood as biological claims. Let us focus on the slogan that has\ntraditionally dominated discussions of human nature in Western\nphilosophy, that humans are \u201crational animals\u201d.\n\nFirst, if Pellegrin and Balme are right that Aristotelian zoology is\nuninterested in classifying species, then ascribing the capacity for\n\u201crationality\u201d cannot have the function of naming a\nbiological trait that distinguishes humans from other animals. This is\nsupported by two further sets of considerations. To begin with,\nAristotle\u2019s explicit assertion that a series of\ndifferentiae would be needed to \u201cdefine\u201d humans\n(Parts of Animals 644a) is cashed out in the long list of\nfeatures he takes to be their distinguishing marks, such as speech,\nhaving hair on both eyelids, blinking, having hands, upright posture,\nbreasts in front, the largest and moistest brain, fleshy legs and\nbuttocks (Lloyd 1983: 29ff.). Furthermore, there is in Aristotle no\ncapacity for reason that is both exclusive to, and universal among\nanthropoi. One part or kind of reason, \u201cpractical\nintelligence\u201d (phronesis), is, Aristotle claims, found\nin both humans and other animals, being merely superior in the former\n(Parts of Animals, 687a). Now, there are other forms of\nreasoning of which this is not true, forms whose presence are\nsufficient for being human: humans are the only animals capable of\ndeliberation (History of Animals 488b) and reasoning (to\nnoein), in as far as this extends to mathematics and first\nphilosophy. Nevertheless, these forms of reasoning are unnecessary:\nslaves, who Aristotle includes among humans (Politics 1255a),\nare said to have no deliberative faculty (to bouleutikon) at\nall (Politics 1260a; cf. Richter 2011: 42ff.). Presumably,\nthey will also be without the capacities necessary for first\nphilosophy.\n\nSecond, these Aristotelian claims raise the question as to whether the\nascription of rationality is even intended as an ascription to an\nindividual in as far as she or he belongs to a biological kind. The\nanswer might appear to be obviously affirmative. Aristotle uses the\nclaim that a higher level of reason is characteristic of humans to\nteleologically explain other morphological features, in particular\nupright gait and the morphology of the hands (Parts of\nAnimals 686a, 687a). However, the kind of reason at issue here is\npractical intelligence, the kind humans and animals share, not the\ncapacity for mathematics and metaphysics, which among animals is\nexercised exclusively by humans. In as far as humans are able to\nexercise this latter capacity in contemplation, Aristotle claims that\nthey \u201cpartake of the divine\u201d (Parts of Animals\n656a), a claim of which he makes extensive use when grounding his\nethics in human rationality (Nicomachean Ethics\n1177b\u20131178b). When, in a passage to which James Lennox has drawn\nattention (Lennox 1999), Aristotle declares that the rational part of\nthe soul cannot be the object of natural science (Parts of\nAnimals 645a), it seems to be the contemplative part of the soul\nthat is thus excluded from biological investigation, precisely the\nfeature that is named in the influential slogan. If it is the\n\u201csomething divine \u2026 present in\u201d humans that is\ndecisively distinctive of their kind, it seems unclear whether the\nrelevant kind is biological.\n\nIt is not the aim of this entry to decide questions of Aristotle\ninterpretation. What is important is that the relationship of the\nquestion of \u201chuman nature\u201d to biology is, from the\nbeginning of the concept\u2019s career, not as unequivocal as is\noften assumed (e.g., Hull 1986: 7; Richards 2010: 217f.). This is\nparticularly true of the slogan according to which humans are rational\nanimals. In the history of philosophy, this slogan has frequently been\ndetached from any attempt to provide criteria for biological\nclassification or characterisation. When Aquinas picks up the slogan,\nhe is concerned to emphasise that human nature involves a material,\ncorporeal aspect. This aspect is, however, not thought of in\nbiological terms. Humans are decisively \u201crational\nsubstances\u201d, i.e., persons. As such they also belong to a kind\nwhose members also number angels and God (three times) (Eberl 2004).\nSimilarly, Kant is primarily, indeed almost exclusively, interested in\nhuman beings as examples of \u201crational nature\u201d,\n\u201chuman nature\u201d being only one way in which rational nature\ncan be instantiated (Kant 1785, 64, 76, 85). For this reason, Kant\ngenerally talks of \u201crational beings\u201d, rather than of\n\u201crational animals\u201d (1785, 45, 95).\n\nThere is, then, a perspective on humans that is plausibly present in\nAristotle, stronger in Aquinas and dominant in Kant and that involves\nseeing them as instances of a kind other than the \u201chuman\nkind\u201d, i.e., seeing the human animal \u201cas a rational\nbeing\u201d (Kant 1785 [1996: 45]). According to this view, the\n\u201cnature\u201d of humans that is most worthy of philosophical\ninterest is the one they possess not insofar as they are human, but\ninsofar as they are rational. Where this is the relevant use of the\nconcept of human nature, being a specimen of the biological species is\nunnecessary for possessing the corresponding property. Specimens of\nother species, as well as non-biological entities may also belong to\nthe relevant kind. It is also insufficient, as not all humans will\nhave the properties necessary for membership in that kind.\n\nAs both a biologist and ethicist, Aristotle is at once a detached\nscientist and a participant in forms of interpersonal and political\ninteraction only available to contemporary humans living in large,\nsedentary subpopulations. It seems plausible that a participant\nperspective may have suggested a different take on what it is to be\nhuman, perhaps even a different take on the sense in which humans\nmight be rational animals, to that of biological science. We will\nreturn to this difference in\n section 5\n of the entry.\n2. The Nature of the Evolutionary Unit Homo sapiens and its Specimens\n\nDetailing the features in virtue of which an organism is a specimen of\nthe species Homo sapiens is a purely biological task. Whether\nsuch specification is achievable and, if so how, is controversial. It\nis controversial for the same reasons for which it is controversial\nwhat conditions need to be met for an organism to be a specimen of any\nspecies. These reasons derive from the theory of evolution.\n\nA first step to understanding these reasons involves noting a further\nambiguity in the use of the expression \u201chuman nature\u201d,\nthis time an ambiguity specific to taxonomy. The term can be used to\npick out a set of properties as an answer to two different questions.\nThe first concerns the properties of some organism which make\nit the case that it belongs to the species Homo\nsapiens. The second concerns the properties in virtue of which a\npopulation or metapopulation is the species Homo\nsapiens. Correspondingly, \u201chuman nature\u201d can pick out\neither the properties of organisms that constitute their partaking in\nthe species Homo sapiens or the properties of some\nhigher-level entity that constitute it as that species. Human nature\nmight then either be the nature of the species or the nature of\nspecies specimens as specimens of the species.\n\nIt is evolution that confers on this distinction its particular form\nand importance. The variation among organismic traits, without which\nthere would be no evolution, has its decisive effects at the level of\npopulations. These are groups of organisms that in some way cohere at\na time in spite of the variation of traits among the component\norganisms. It is population-level groupings, taxa, not organisms, that\nevolve and it is taxa, such as species, that provide the organisms\nthat belong to them with genetic resources (Ghiselin 1987: 141). The\nspecies Homo sapiens appears to be a metapopulation that\ncoheres at least in part because of the gene flow between its\ncomponent organisms brought about by interbreeding (cf. Ereshefsky\n1991: 96ff.). Hence, according to evolutionary theory, Homo\nsapiens is plausibly a higher-level entity\u2014a unit of\nevolution\u2014consisting of the lower-level entities that are\nindividual human beings. The two questions phrased in terms of\n\u201chuman nature\u201d thus concern the conditions for\nindividuation of the population-level entity and the conditions under\nwhich organisms are components of that entity.\n2.1 The Nature of the Species Taxon\n\nThe theory of evolution transforms the way we should understand the\nrelationship between human organisms and the species to which they\nbelong. The taxonomic assumption of TP5 was that species are\nindividuated by means of intrinsic properties that are individually\ninstantiated by certain organisms. Instantiating those properties is\ntaken to be necessary and sufficient for those organisms to belong to\nthe species. Evolutionary theory makes it clear that species, as\npopulation-level entities, cannot be individuated by means of the\nproperties of lower-level constituents, in our case, of individual\nhuman organisms (Sober 1980: 355).\n\nThe exclusion of this possibility grounds a decisive difference from\nthe way natural kinds are standardly construed in the wake of Locke\nand Kripke. Recall that, in this Kripkean construal, lumps of matter\nare instances of chemical kinds because of their satisfaction of\nintrinsic necessary and sufficient conditions, viz. their atoms\npossessing a certain number of protons. The same conditions also\nindividuate the chemical kinds themselves. Chemical kinds are thus\nspatiotemporally unrestricted sets. This means that there are no\nmetaphysical barriers to the chance generation of members of the kind,\nindependently of whether the kind is instantiated at any contiguous\ntime or place. Nitrogen could come to exist by metaphysical\nhappenstance, should an element with the atomic number 14 somehow come\ninto being, even in a world in which up to that point no nitrogen has\nexisted (Hull 1978: 349; 1984: 22).\n\nIn contrast, a species can only exist at time \\(t_n\\) if either it or\na parent species existed at \\(t_{n-1}\\) and there was some\nrelationship of spatial contiguity between component individuals of\nthe species at \\(t_n\\) and the individuals belonging to either the\nsame species or the parent species at \\(t_{n-1}\\). This is because of\nthe essential role of the causal relationship of heredity. Heredity\ngenerates both the coherence across a population requisite for the\nexistence of a species and the variability of predominant traits\nwithin the population, without which a species would not evolve.\n\nFor this reason, the species Homo sapiens, like every other\nspecies taxon, must meet a historical or genealogical condition. (For\npluralistic objections to even this condition, see Kitcher 1984:\n320ff.; Dupr\u00e9 1993: 49f.) This condition is best expressed as a\nsegment of a population-level phylogenetic tree, where such trees\nrepresent ancestor-descendent series (Hull 1978: 349; de Queiroz 1999:\n50ff.; 2005). Species, as the point is often put, are historical\nentities, rather than kinds or classes (Hull 1978: 338ff.; 1984: 19).\nThe fact that species are not only temporally, but also spatially\nrestricted has also led to the stronger claim that they are\nindividuals (Ghiselin 1974; 1997: 14ff.; Hull 1978: 338). If this is\ncorrect, then organisms are not members, but parts of species\ntaxa. Independently of whether this claim is true for all biological\nspecies, Homo sapiens is a good candidate for a species that\nbelongs to the category individual. This is because the\nspecies is characterised not only by spatiotemporal continuity, but\nalso by causal processes that account for the coherence between its\ncomponent parts. These processes plausibly include not only\ninterbreeding, but also conspecific recognition and particular forms\nof communication (Richards 2010: 158ff., 218).\n\nImportantly, the genealogical condition is only a necessary condition,\nas genealogy unites all the segments of one lineage. The segment of\nthe phylogenetic tree that represents some species taxon begins with a\nnode that represents a lineage-splitting or speciation event.\nDetermining that node requires attention to general speciation theory,\nwhich has proposed various competing criteria (Dupr\u00e9 1993:\n48f.; Okasha 2002: 201; Coyne & Orr 2004). In the case of Homo\nsapiens, it requires attention to the specifics of the human\ncase, which are also controversial (see Crow 2003; Cela-Conde &\nAyala 2017: 11ff.). The end point of the segment is marked either by\nsome further speciation event or, as may seem likely in the case of\nHomo sapiens, by the destruction of the metapopulation. Only\nwhen the temporal boundaries of the segment have become determinate\nwould it be possible to adduce sufficient conditions for the existence\nof such a historical entity. Hence, if \u201chuman nature\u201d is\nunderstood to pick out the necessary and sufficient conditions that\nindividuate the species taxon Homo sapiens, its content is\nnot only controversial, but epistemically unavailable to us.\n2.2 The Nature of Species Specimens as Species Specimens\n\nIf we take such a view of the individuating conditions for the species\nHomo sapiens, what are the consequences for the question of\nwhich organisms belong to the species? It might appear that it leaves\nopen the possibility that speciation has resulted in some intrinsic\nproperty or set of properties establishing the cohesion specific to\nthe taxon and that such properties count as necessary and sufficient\nfor belonging to it (cf. Devitt 2008: 17ff.). This appearance would be\ndeceptive. To begin with, no intrinsic property can be necessary\nbecause of the sheer empirical improbability that all species\nspecimens grouped together by the relevant lineage segment instantiate\nany such candidate property. For example, there are individuals who\nare missing legs, inner organs or the capacity for language, but who\nremain biologically human (Hull 1986: 5). Evolutionary theory\nclarifies why this is so: variability, secured by mechanisms such as\nmutation and recombination, is the key to evolution, so that, should\nsome qualitative property happen to be universal among all extant\nspecies specimens immediately after the completion of speciation, that\nis no guarantee that it will continue to be so throughout the lifespan\nof the taxon (Hull 1984: 35; Ereshefsky 2008: 101). The common thought\nthat there must be at least some genetic property common to all human\norganisms is also false (R. Wilson 1999a: 190; Sterelny &\nGriffiths 1999: 7; Okasha 2002: 196f.): phenotypical properties that\nare shared in a population are frequently co-instantiated as a result\nof the complex interaction of differing gene-regulatory networks.\nConversely, the same network can under different circumstances lead to\ndiffering phenotypical consequences (Walsh 2006: 437ff.). Even if it\nshould turn out that every human organism instantiated some property,\nthis would be a contingent, rather than a necessary fact (Sober 1980:\n354; Hull 1986: 3).\n\nMoreover, the chances of any such universal property also being\nsufficient are vanishingly small, as the sharing of properties by\nspecimens of other species can result from various mechanisms, in\nparticular from the inheritance of common genes in related species and\nfrom parallel evolution. This doesn\u2019t entail that there may be\nno intrinsic properties that are sufficient belonging to the species.\nThere are fairly good candidates for such properties, if we compare\nhumans with other terrestrial organisms. Language use and a\nself-understanding as moral agents come to mind. However, whether\nnon-terrestrial entities might possess such properties is an open\nquestion. And decisively, they are obviously hopeless as necessary\nconditions (cf. Samuels 2012: 9).\n\nThis leaves only the possibility that the conditions for belonging to\nthe species are, like the individuating conditions for the species\ntaxon, relational. Lineage-based individuation of a taxon depends on\nits component organisms being spatially and temporally situated in\nsuch a way that the causal processes necessary for the inheritance of\ntraits can take place. In the human case, the key processes are those\nof sexual reproduction. Therefore, being an organism that belongs to\nthe species Homo sapiens is a matter of being connected\nreproductively to organisms situated unequivocally on the relevant\nlineage segment. In other words, the key necessary condition is having\nbeen sexually reproduced by specimens of the species (Kronfeldner\n2018: 100). Hull suggests that the causal condition may be\ndisjunctive, as it could also be fulfilled by a synthetic entity\ncreated by scientists that produces offspring with humans who have\nbeen generated in the standard manner (Hull 1978: 349). Provided that\nthe species is not in the throes of speciation, such direct descent or\nintegration into the reproductive community, i.e., participation in\nthe \u201ccomplex network [\u2026] of mating and\nreproduction\u201d (Hull 1986: 4), will also be sufficient.\n2.3 Responding to the Evolutionary Verdict on Classificatory Essences\n\nThe lack of a \u201chuman essence\u201d in the sense of intrinsic\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to the species taxon\nHomo sapiens, has led a number of philosophers to deny that\nthere is any such thing as human nature (Hull 1984: 19; 1986; Ghiselin\n1997: 1; de Sousa 2000). As this negative claim concerns properties\nintrinsic both to relevant organisms and to the taxon, it is equally\ndirected at the \u201cnature\u201d of the organisms as species\nspecimens and at that of the species taxon itself. An alternative\nconsists in retracting the condition that a classificatory essence\nmust be intrinsic, a move which allows talk of a historical or\nrelational essence and a corresponding relational conception of\ntaxonomic human nature (Okasha 2002: 202).\n\nWhich of these ways of responding to the challenge from evolutionary\ntheory appears best is likely to depend on how one takes it that the\nclassificatory issues relate to the other matters at stake in the\noriginal human nature package. These concern the explanatory and\nnormative questions raised by TP1\u2013TP4. We turn to these in the\nfollowing three sections of this article.\n\nAn exclusively genealogical conception of human nature is clearly not\nwell placed to fulfil an explanatory role comparable to that envisaged\nin the traditional package. What might have an explanatory function\nare the properties of the entities from which the taxon or its\nspecimens are descended. Human nature, genealogically understood,\nmight serve as the conduit for explanations in terms of such\nproperties, but will not itself explain anything. After all,\nintegration in a network of sexual reproduction will be partly\ndefinitive of the specimens of all sexual species, whilst what is to\nbe explained will vary enormously across taxa.\n\nThis lack of fit between classificatory and explanatory roles\nconfronts us with a number of further theoretical possibilities. For\nexample, one might see this incompatibility as strengthening the\nworries of eliminativists such as Ghiselin and Hull: even if the\nsubtraction of intrinsicality were not on its own sufficient to\njustify abandoning talk of human nature, its conjunction with a lack\nof explanatory power, one might think, certainly is (Dupr\u00e9\n2003: 109f.; Lewens 2012: 473). Or one might argue that it is the\nclassificatory ambitions associated with talk of human nature that\nshould be abandoned. Once this is done, one might hope that certain\nsets of intrinsic properties can be distinguished that figure\ndecisively in explanations and that can still justifiably be labelled\n\u201chuman nature\u201d (Roughley 2011: 15; Godfrey-Smith 2014:\n140).\n\nTaking this second line in turn raises two questions: first, in what\nsense are the properties thus picked out specifically\n\u201chuman\u201d, if they are neither universal among, nor unique\nto species specimens? Second, in what sense are the properties\n\u201cnatural\u201d? Naturalness as independence from the effects of\nhuman intentional action is a key feature of the original package\n(TP1). Whether some such conception can be coherently applied to\nhumans is a challenge for any non-classificatory account.\n3. Characteristic Human Properties\n3.1 Privileging Properties\n\nThe answer given by TP2 to the first question was in terms of the\nfully developed human form, where \u201cform\u201d does not refer\nsolely to observable physical or behavioural characteristics, but also\nincludes psychological features. This answer entails two claims:\nfirst, that there is one single such \u201cform\u201d, i.e.,\nproperty or set of properties, that figures in explanations that range\nacross individual human organisms. It also entails that there is a\npoint in human development that counts as \u201cfull\u201d, that is,\nas development\u2019s goal or \u201ctelos\u201d. These claims go\nhand in hand with the assumption that there is a distinction to be\ndrawn between normal and abnormal adult specimens of the species.\nThere is, common sense tells us, a sense in which normal adult humans\nhave two legs, two eyes, one heart and two kidneys at specific\nlocations in the body; they also have various dispositions, for\ninstance, to feel pain and to feel emotions, and a set of capacities,\nsuch as for perception and for reasoning. And these, so it seems, may\nbe missing, or under- or overdeveloped in abnormal specimens.\n\nSober has influentially described accounts that work with such\nteleological assumptions as adhering to an Aristotelian \u201cNatural\nState Model\u201d (Sober 1980: 353ff.). Such accounts work with a\ndistinction that has no place in evolutionary biology, according to\nwhich variation of properties across populations is the key to\nevolution. Hence, no particular end states of organisms are privileged\nas \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d (Hull 1986: 7ff.). So\nany account that privileges particular morphological, behavioural or\npsychological human features has to provide good reasons that are both\nnon-evolutionary and yet compatible with the evolutionary account of\nspecies. Because of the way that the notion of the normal is\nfrequently employed to exclude and oppress, those reasons should be\nparticularly good (Silvers 1998; Dupr\u00e9 2003: 119ff.; Richter\n2011: 43ff.; Kronfeldner 2018: 15ff.).\n\nThe kinds of reasons that may be advanced could either be internal to,\nor independent of the biological sciences. If the former, then various\ntheoretical options may seem viable. The first grounds in the\nclaim that, although species are not natural kinds and are thus\nunsuited to figuring in laws of nature (Hull 1987: 171), they do\nsupport descriptions with a significant degree of generality, some of\nwhich may be important (Hull 1984: 19). A theory of human nature\ndeveloped on this basis should explain the kind of importance on the\nbasis of which particular properties are emphasised. The\nsecond theoretical option is pluralism about the metaphysics\nof species: in spite of the fairly broad consensus that species are\ndefined as units of evolution, the pluralist can deny the primacy of\nevolutionary dynamics, arguing that other epistemic aims allow the\necologist, the systematist or the ethologist to work with an equally\nlegitimate concept of species that is not, or not exclusively\ngenealogical (cf. Hull 1984: 36; Kitcher 1986: 320ff.; Hull 1987:\n178\u201381; Dupr\u00e9 1993: 43f.). The third option\ninvolves a relaxation of the concept of natural kinds, such that it no\nlonger entails the instantiation of intrinsic, necessary, sufficient\nand spatiotemporally unrestricted properties, but is nevertheless able\nto support causal explanations. Such accounts aim to reunite taxonomic\nand explanatory criteria, thus allowing species taxa to count as\nnatural kinds after all (Boyd 1999a; R. Wilson, Barker, & Brigandt\n2007: 196ff.). Where, finally, the reasons advanced for\nprivileging certain properties are independent of biology, these tend\nto concern features of\nhumans\u2019\u2014\u201cour\u201d\u2014self-understanding as\nparticipants in, rather than observers of, a particular form of life.\nThese are likely to be connected to normative considerations. Here\nagain, it seems that a special explanation will be required for why\nthese privileged properties should be grouped under the rubric\n\u201chuman nature\u201d.\n\nThe accounts to be described in the next\n subsection (3.2)\n of this entry are examples of the first strategy.\n Section 4\n includes discussion of the relaxed natural kinds strategy.\n Section 5\n focuses on accounts of human nature developed from a participant\nperspective and also notes the support that the pluralist metaphysical\nstrategy might be taken to provide.\n3.2 Statistical Normality or Robust Causality\n\nBegin, then, with the idea that to provide an account of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d is to circumscribe a set of generalisations concerning\nhumans. An approach of this sort sees the properties thus itemised as\nspecifically \u201chuman\u201d in as far as they are common among\nspecies specimens. So the privilege accorded to these properties is\npurely statistical and \u201cnormal\u201d means statistically\nnormal. Note that taking the set of statistically normal properties of\nhumans as a non-teleological replacement for the fully developed human\nform retains from the original package the possibility of labelling as\n\u201chuman nature\u201d either those properties themselves (TP3) or\ntheir developmental cause (TP2). Either approach avoids the\nclassificatory worries dealt with in\n section 2:\n it presupposes that those organisms whose properties are relevant are\nalready distinguished as such specimens. What is to be explained is,\nthen, the ways humans generally, though not universally, are. And\namong these ways are ways they may share with most specimens of some\nother species, in particular those that belong to the same order\n(primates) and the same class (mammals).\n\nOne should be clear what follows from this interpretation of\n\u201chuman\u201d. The organisms among whom statistical frequency is\nsought range over those generated after speciation around 150,000\nyears ago to those that will exist immediately prior to the\nspecies\u2019 extinction. On the one hand, because of the variability\nintrinsic to species, we are in the dark as to the properties that may\nor may not characterise those organisms that will turn out to be the\nlast of the taxon. On the other hand, the time lag of around 100,000\nyears between the first anatomically modern humans and the general\nonset of behavioural modernity around the beginning of the Upper\nPalaeolithic means that there are likely to be many widespread\npsychological properties of contemporary humans that were not\npossessed by the majority of the species\u2019 specimens during two\nthirds of the species\u2019 history. This is true even if the\npractices seen as the signatures of behavioural modernity (see\n \u00a71.1)\n developed sporadically, disappeared and reappeared at far removed\npoints of time and space over tens of thousands of years before 50,000\nka (McBrearty & Brooks 2000; Sterelny 2011).\n\nAccording to several authors (Machery 2008; 2018; Samuels 2012; Ramsey\n2013), the expression \u201chuman nature\u201d should be used to\ngroup properties that are the focus of much current behavioural,\npsychological and social science. However, as the cognitive and\npsychological sciences are generally interested in present-day humans,\nthere is a mismatch between scientific focus and a grouping criterion\nthat takes in all the properties generally or typically instantiated\nby specimens of the entire taxon. For this reason, the expression\n\u201chuman nature\u201d is likely to refer to properties of an even\nmore temporally restricted set of organisms belonging to the species.\nThat restriction can be thought of in indexical terms, i.e., as a\nrestriction to contemporary humans. However, some authors claim\nexplicitly that their accounts entail that human nature can change\n(Ramsey 2013: 992; Machery 2018: 20). Human nature would then be the\nobject of temporally indexed investigations, as is, for example, the\nweight of individual humans in everyday contexts. (Without temporal\nspecification, there is no determinate answer to a question such as\n\u201cHow much did David Hume weigh?\u201d) An example of\nMachery\u2019s is dark skin colour. This characteristic, he claims,\nceased to be a feature of human nature thus understood 7,000 years\nago, if that was when skin pigmentation became polymorphic. The\nexample indicates that the temporal range may be extremely narrow from\nan evolutionary point of view.\n\nSuch accounts are both compatible with evolutionary theory and\ncoherent. However, in as far as they are mere summary or list\nconceptions, it is unclear what their epistemic value might be. They\nwill tend to accord with everyday common sense, for which \u201chuman\nnature\u201d may in a fairly low-key sense simply be the properties\nthat (contemporary) humans generally tend to manifest (Roughley 2011:\n16). They will also conform to one level of the expression\u2019s use\nin Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340),\nwhich, in an attempt to provide a human \u201cmental geography\u201d\n(1748 [1970: 13]), lists a whole series of features, such as prejudice\n(1739\u201340, I,iii,13), selfishness (III,ii,5), a tendency to\ntemporal discounting (III,ii,7) and an addiction to general rules\n(III,ii,9).\n\nAccounts of this kind have been seen as similar in content to field\nguides for other animals (Machery 2008: 323; Godfrey-Smith 2014: 139).\nAs Hull points out, within a restricted ecological context and a short\nperiod of evolutionary time, the ascription of readily observable\nmorphological or behavioural characteristics to species specimens is a\nstraightforward and unproblematic enterprise (Hull 1987: 175).\nHowever, the analogy is fairly unhelpful, as the primary function of\nassertions in field guides is to provide a heuristics for amateur\nclassification. In contrast, a list conception of the statistically\nnormal properties of contemporary humans presupposes identification of\nthe organisms in question as humans. Moreover, such accounts certainly\ndo not entail easy epistemic access to the properties in question,\nwhich may only be experimentally discovered. Nevertheless, there\nremains something correct about the analogy, as such accounts are a\ncollection of assertions linked only by the fact that they are about\nthe same group of organisms (Sterelny 2018: 123).\n\nMore sophisticated nature documentaries may summarise causal features\nof the lives of animals belonging to specific species. An analogous\nconception of human nature has also been proposed, according to which\nhuman nature is a set of pervasive and robust causal nexuses amongst\nhumans. The list that picks out this set would specify causal\nconnections between antecedent properties, such as having been exposed\nto benzene or subject to abuse as a child, and consequent properties,\nsuch as developing cancer or being aggressive towards one\u2019s own\nchildren (Ramsey 2013: 988ff.). Human nature thus understood would\nhave an explanatory component, a component internal to each item on\nthe list. Human nature itself would, however, not be explanatory, but\nrather the label for a list of highly diverse causal connections.\n\nAn alternative way to integrate an explanatory component in a\nstatistical normality account involves picking out that set of\nstatistically common properties that have a purely evolutionary\nexplanation (Machery 2008; 2018). This reinterpretation of the concept\nof naturalness that featured in the original package (TP1) involves a\ncontrast with social learning. Processes grouped together under this\nlatter description are taken to be alternative explanations to those\nprovided by evolution. However, learning plays a central role, not\nonly in the development of individual humans, but also in the iterated\ninteraction of entire populations with environments structured and\nrestructured through such interaction (Stotz 2010: 488ff.; Sterelny\n2012: 23ff.). Hence, the proposal raises serious epistemic questions\nas to how the distinction is precisely to be drawn and\noperationalised. (For discussion, see Prinz 2012; Lewens 2012: 464ff.;\nRamsey 2013: 985; Machery 2018: 15ff.; Sterelny 2018: 116; Kronfeldner\n2018: 147ff.).\n4. Explanatory Human Properties\n\nThe replacement of the concept of a fully developed form with a\nstatistical notion yields a deflationary account of human nature with,\nat most, restricted explanatory import. The correlative, explanatory\nnotion in the original package, that of the fully developed\nform\u2019s blueprint (TP2), has to some authors seemed worth\nreframing in terms made possible by advances in modern biology,\nparticularly in genetics.\n\nClearly, there must be explanations of why humans generally walk on\ntwo legs, speak and plan many of their actions in advance.\nGenealogical, or what have been called \u201cultimate\u201d (Mayr)\nor \u201chistorical\u201d (Kitcher) explanations can advert to the\naccumulation of coherence among entrenched, stable properties along a\nlineage. These may well have resulted from selection pressures shared\nby the relevant organisms (cf. Wimsatt 2003; Lewens 2009). The fact\nthat there are exceptions to any generalisations concerning\ncontemporary humans does not entail that there is no need for\nexplanations of such exception-allowing generalisations. Plausibly,\nthese general, though not universal truths will have \u201cstructural\nexplanations\u201d, that is, explanations in terms of underlying\nstructures or mechanisms (Kitcher 1986: 320; Devitt 2008: 353). These\nstructures, so seems, might to a significant degree be inscribed in\nhumans\u2019 DNA.\n\nThe precise details of rapidly developing empirical science will\nimprove our understanding of the extent to which there is a\ndeterminate relationship between contemporary humans\u2019 genome and\ntheir physical, psychological and behavioural properties. There is,\nhowever, little plausibility that the blueprint metaphor might be\napplicable to the way DNA is transcribed, translated and interacts\nwith its cellular environment. Such interaction is itself subject to\ninfluence by the organism\u2019s external environment, including its\nsocial environment (Dupr\u00e9 2001: 29ff.; 2003: 111ff.; Griffiths\n2011: 326; Prinz 2012: 17ff.; Griffiths & Tabery 2013: 71ff.;\nGriffiths & Stotz 2013: 98ff., 143ff.). For example, the feature\nof contemporary human life for which there must according to Aristotle\nbe some kind of blueprint, viz. rational agency, is, as Sterelny has\nargued, so strongly dependent on social scaffolding that any claim to\nthe effect that human rationality is somehow genetically programmed\nignores the causal contributions of manifestly indispensable\nenvironmental factors (Sterelny 2018: 120).\n4.1 Genetically Based Psychological Adaptations?\n\nNevertheless, humans do generally develop a specific set of\nphysiological features, such as two lungs, one stomach, one pancreas\nand two eyes. Moreover, having such a bodily architecture is,\naccording to the evidence from genetics, to a significant extent the\nresult of developmental programmes that ground in gene regulatory\nnetworks (GRNs). These are stretches of non-coding DNA that regulate\ngene transcription. GRNs are modular, more or less strongly entrenched\nstructures. The most highly conserved of these tend to be the\nphylogenetically most archaic (Carroll 2000; Walsh 2006: 436ff.;\nWillmore 2012: 227ff.). The GRNs responsible for basic physiological\nfeatures may be taken, in a fairly innocuous sense, to belong to an\nevolved human nature.\n\nImportantly, purely morphological features have generally not been the\nexplananda of accounts that have gone under the rubric \u201chuman\nnature\u201d. What has frequently motivated explanatory accounts thus\nlabelled is the search for underlying structures responsible for\ngenerally shared psychological features. \u201cEvolutionary\nPsychologists\u201d have built a research programme around the claim\nthat humans share a psychological architecture that parallels that of\ntheir physiology. This, they believe, consists of a structured set of\npsychological \u201corgans\u201d or modules (Tooby & Cosmides\n1990: 29f.; 1992: 38, 113). This architecture is, they claim, in turn\nthe product of developmental programmes inscribed in humans\u2019 DNA\n(1992: 45). Such generally distributed developmental programmes they\nlabel \u201chuman nature\u201d (1990: 23).\n\nThis conception raises the question of how analogous the\ncharacteristic physical and psychological \u201carchitectures\u201d\nare. For one thing, the physical properties that tend to appear in\nsuch lists are far more coarse-grained than the candidates for shared\npsychological properties (D. Wilson 1994: 224ff.): the claim is not\njust that humans tend to have perceptual, desiderative, doxastic and\nemotional capacities, but that the mental states that realise these\ncapacities tend to have contents of specific types. Perhaps an\narchitecture of the former kind\u2014of a formal psychology\u2014is\na plausible, if relatively unexciting candidate for the mental side of\nwhat an evolved human nature should explain. Either way, any such\nconception needs to adduce criteria for the individuation of such\n\u201cmental organs\u201d (D. Wilson 1994: 233). Relatedly, if the\nmost strongly entrenched developmental programmes are the most\narchaic, it follows that, although these will be species-typical, they\nwill not be species-specific. Programmes for the development of body\nparts have been identified for higher taxa, rather than for\nspecies.\n\nA further issue that dogs any such attempts to explicate the\n\u201chuman\u201d dimension of human nature in terms of\ndevelopmental programmes inscribed in human DNA concerns Evolutionary\nPsychologists\u2019 assertion that the programmes are the same in\nevery specimen of the species. This assertion goes hand in hand with\nthe claim that what is explained by such programmes is a deep\npsychological structure that is common to almost all humans and\nunderlies the surface diversity of behavioural and psychological\nphenomena (Tooby & Cosmides 1990: 23f.). For Evolutionary\nPsychologists, the (near-)universality of both developmental\nprogrammes and deep psychological structure has an ultimate\nexplanation in evolutionary processes that mark their products as\nnatural in the sense of TP1. Both, they claim, are adaptations. These\nare features that were selected for because their possession in the\npast conferred a fitness advantage on their possessors. Evolutionary\nPsychologists conceive that advantage as conferred by the fulfilment\nof some specific function. They summarise selection for that function\nas \u201cdesign\u201d, which they take to have operated equally on\nall species specimens since the Pleistocene. This move reintroduces\nthe teleological idea of a fully developed form beyond mere\nstatistical normality (TP3).\n\nThis move has been extensively criticised. First, selection pressures\noperate at the level of groups and hence need not lead to the same\nstructures in all a group\u2019s members (D. Wilson 1994: 227ff.;\nGriffiths 2011: 325; Sterelny 2018: 120). Second, other evolutionary\nmechanisms than natural selection might be explanatorily decisive.\nGenetic drift or mutation and recombination might, for example, also\nconfer \u201cnaturalness\u201d in the sense of evolutionary genesis\n(Buller 2000: 436). Third, as we have every reason to assume that the\nevolution of human psychology is ongoing, evolutionary biology\nprovides little support for the claim that particular programmes and\nassociated traits evolved to fixity in the Pleistocene (Buller 2000:\n477ff.; Downes 2010).\n\nPerhaps, however, there might turn out to be gene control networks\nthat do generally structure certain features of the psychological\ndevelopment of contemporary humans (Walsh 2006: 440ff.). The quest for\nsuch GNRs can, then, count as the search for an explanatory nature of\ncontemporary humans, where the explanatory function thus sought is\ndivorced from any classificatory role.\n4.2 Abandoning Intrinsicality\n\nThere has, however, been a move in general philosophy of science that,\nif acceptable, would transform the relationship between the taxonomic\nand explanatory features of species. This move was influentially\ninitiated by Richard Boyd (1999a). It begins with the claim that the\nattempt to define natural kinds in terms of spatiotemporally\nunrestricted, intrinsic, necessary and sufficient conditions is a\nhangover from empiricism that should be abandoned by realist\nmetaphysics. Instead, natural kinds should be understood as kinds that\nsupport induction and explanation, where generalisations at work in\nsuch processes need not be exceptionless. Thus understood, essences of\nnatural kinds, i.e., their \u201cnatures\u201d, need be neither\nintrinsic nor be possessed by all and only members of the kinds.\nInstead, essences consist of property clusters integrated by\nstabilising mechanisms (\u201chomeostatic property clusters\u201d,\nHPCs). These are networks of causal relations such that the presence\nof certain properties tends to generate or uphold others and the\nworkings of underlying mechanisms contribute to the same effect. Boyd\nnames storms, galaxies and capitalism as plausible examples (Boyd\n1999b: 82ff.). However, he takes species to be the paradigmatic HPC\nkinds. According to this view, the genealogical character of a\nspecies\u2019 nature does not undermine its causal role. Rather, it\nhelps to explain the specific way in which the properties cohere that\nmake up the taxon\u2019s essence. Moreover, these can include\nextrinsic properties, for example, properties of constructed niches\n(Boyd 1991: 142, 1999a: 164ff.; Griffiths 1999: 219ff.; R. Wilson et\nal. 2007: 202ff.).\n\nWhether such an account can indeed adequately explain taxonomic\npractice for species taxa is a question that can be left open here\n(see Ereshefsky & Matthen 2005: 16ff.). By its own lights the\naccount does not identify conditions for belonging to a species such\nas Homo sapiens (Samuels 2012: 25f.). Whether it enables the\nidentification of factors that play the explanatory roles that the\nterm \u201chuman nature\u201d might be supposed to pick out is\nperhaps the most interesting question. Two ways in which an account of\nhuman nature might be developed from such a starting point have been\nsketched.\n\nAccording to Richard Samuels\u2019 proposal, human nature should be\nunderstood as the empirically discoverable proximal mechanisms\nresponsible for psychological development and for the manifestation of\npsychological capacities. These will include physiological mechanisms,\nsuch as the development of the neural tube, as well as environmentally\nscaffolded learning procedures; they will also include the various\nmodular systems distinguished by cognitive science, such as visual\nprocessing and memory systems (Samuels 2012: 22ff.). Like mere list\nconceptions (cf.\n \u00a73.2),\n such an account has a precedent in Hume, for whom human nature also\nincludes causal \u201cprinciples\u201d that structure operations of\nthe human mind (1739\u201340, Intro.), for example, the mechanisms of\nsympathy (III,iii,1; II,ii,6). Hume, however, thought of the relevant\ncausal principles as intrinsic.\n\nA second proposal, advanced by Paul Griffiths and Karola Stotz,\nexplicitly suggests taking explanandum and explanans to be picked out\nby different uses of the expression \"human nature\". In both\ncases, the \u201cnature\u201d in question is that of the taxon, not\nof individual organisms. The former use simply refers to \u201cwhat\nhuman beings are like\u201d, where \u201chuman beings\u201d means\nall species specimens. Importantly, this characterisation does not aim\nat shared characteristics, but is open for polymorphisms both across a\npopulation and across life stages of individual organisms. The causal\nconception of human nature, what explains this spectrum of similarity\nand difference in life histories, is equated by Griffiths and Stotz\nwith the organism-environment system that supports human development.\nIt thus includes all the genetic, epigenetic and environmental\nresources responsible for varying human life cycles (Griffiths 2011:\n319; Stotz & Griffiths 2018, 66f.). It follows that explanatory\nhuman nature at one point in time can be radically different from\nhuman nature at some other point in time.\n\nGriffiths and Stotz are clear that this account diverges significantly\nfrom traditional accounts, as it rejects assumptions that human\ndevelopment has a goal, that human nature is possessed by all and only\nspecimens of the species and that it consists of intrinsic properties.\nThey see these assumptions as features of the folk biology of human\nnature that is as scientifically relevant as are folk conceptions of\nheat for its scientific understanding (Stotz 2010: 488; Griffiths\n2011: 319ff.; Stotz & Griffiths 2018: 60ff.). This raises the\nquestion as to whether such a developmental systems account should not\nsimply advocate abandoning the term, as is suggested by Sterelny\n(2018) on the basis of closely related considerations. A reason for\nnot doing so might lie in the fact that, as talk of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d is often practised with normative intent or at least\nwith normative consequences (Stotz & Griffiths 2018: 71f.), use of\nthe term to pick out the real, complex explanatory factors at work\nmight help to counter those normative uses that employ false, folk\nbiological assumptions.\n4.3 Secondary Altriciality as a Game-Changer\n\nExplanatory accounts that emphasise developmental plasticity in the\nproducts of human DNA, in the neural architecture of the brain and in\nthe human mind tend to reject the assumption that explanations of what\nhumans are like should focus on intrinsic features. It should,\nhowever, be noted that such accounts can be interpreted as assigning\nthe feature of heightened plasticity the key role in such explanations\n(cf. Montagu 1956: 79). Accounts that make plasticity causally central\nalso raise the question as to whether there are not biological\nfeatures that in turn explain it and should therefore be assigned a\nmore central status in a theory of explanatory human nature.\n\nA prime candidate for this role is what the zoologist Adolf Portmann\nlabelled human \u201csecondary altriciality\u201d, a unique\nconstellation of features of the human neonate relative to other\nprimates: human neonates are, in their helplessness and possession of\na relatively undeveloped brain, neurologically and behaviourally\naltricial, that is, in need of care. However they are also born with\nopen and fully functioning sense organs, otherwise a mark of precocial\nspecies, in which neonates are able to fend for themselves (Portmann\n1951: 44ff.). The facts that the human neonate brain is less than 30%\nof the size of the adult brain and that brain development after birth\ncontinues at the fetal rate for the first year (Walker & Ruff\n1993, 227) led the anthropologist Ashley Montagu to talk of\n\u201cexterogestation\u201d (Montagu 1961: 156). With these features\nin mind, Portmann characterised the care structures required by\nprolonged infant helplessness as the \u201csocial uterus\u201d\n(Portmann 1967: 330). Finally, the fact that the rapid development of\nthe infant brain takes place during a time in which the infant\u2019s\nsense organs are open and functioning places an adaptive premium on\nlearning that is unparalleled among organisms (Gould 1977: 401; cf.\nStotz & Griffiths 2018: 70).\n\nOf course, these features are themselves contingent products of\nevolution that could be outlived by the species. Gould sees them as\ncomponents of a general retardation of development that has\ncharacterised human evolution (Gould 1977: 365ff.), where\n\u201chuman\u201d should be seen as referring to the clade\u2014all\nthe descendants of a common ancestor\u2014rather than to the species.\nAnthropologists estimate that secondary altriciality characterised the\nlineage as from Homo erectus 1.5 million years ago (Rosenberg\n& Trevathan 1995: 167). We are, then, dealing with a set of deeply\nentrenched features, features that were in place long before\nbehavioural modernity.\n\nIt is conceivable that the advent of secondary altriciality was a key\ntransformation in generating the radical plasticity of human\ndevelopment beginning with early hominins. However, as Sterelny points\nout, there are serious difficulties with isolating any particular game\nchanger. Secondary altriciality, or the plasticity that may in part be\nexplained by it, would thus seem to fall victim to the same verdict as\nthe game changers named by the traditional human nature slogans.\nHowever, maybe it is more plausible to think in terms of a matrix of\ntraits: perhaps a game-changing constellation of properties present in\nthe population after the split from pan can be shown to have\ngenerated forms of niche construction that fed back into and modified\nthe original traits. These modifications may in turn have had further\npsychological and behavioural consequences in steps that plausibly\nbrought selective advantages (Sterelny 2018: 115).\n5. Human Nature, the Participant Perspective and Morality\n5.1. Human Nature from a Participant Perspective\n\nIn such a culture-mind coevolutionary account, there may be a place\nfor the referents of some of the traditional philosophical slogans\nintended to pin down \u201cthe human essence\u201c or \u201chuman\nnature\u201d\u2014reason, linguistic capacity (\u201cthe\nspeaking animal\u201d, Herder 1772 [2008: 97]), a more general\nsymbolic capacity (animal symbolicum, Cassirer 1944: 44),\nfreedom of the will (Pico della Mirandola 1486 [1965: 5]; Sartre 1946\n[2007: 29, 47]), a specific, \u201cpolitical\u201d form of\nsociality, or a unique type of moral motivation (Hutcheson 1730:\n\u00a715). These are likely, at best, to be the (still evolving)\nproducts in contemporary humans of processes set in motion by a trait\nconstellation that includes proto-versions of (some of) these\ncapacities. Such a view may also be compatible with an account of\n\u201cwhat contemporary humans are like\u201d that abstracts from\nthe evolutionary time scale of eons and focuses instead on the present\n(cf. Dupr\u00e9 1993: 43), whilst neither merely cataloguing widely\ndistributed traits\n (\u00a73.2)\n nor attempting explanations in terms of the human genome\n (\u00a74.1).\n The traditional slogans appear to be attempts to summarise some such\naccounts. It seems clear, though, that their aims are significantly\ndifferent from those of the biologically, or otherwise scientifically\norientated positions thus far surveyed.\n\nTwo features of such accounts are worth emphasising, both of which we\nalready encountered in Aristotle\u2019s contribution to the original\npackage. The first involves a shift in perspective from that of the\nscientific observer to that of a participant in a\ncontemporary human life form. Whereas the human\u2014or\nnon-human\u2014biologist may ask what modern humans are like, just as\nthey may ask what bonobos are like, the question that traditional\nphilosophical accounts of human nature are plausibly attempting to\nanswer is what it is like to live one\u2019s life as a contemporary\nhuman. This question is likely to provoke the counter-question as to\nwhether there is anything that it is like to live simply as a\ncontemporary human, rather than as a\nhuman-in-a-specific-historical-and-cultural context (Habermas 1958:\n32; Geertz 1973: 52f.; Dupr\u00e9 2003: 110f.). For the traditional\nsloganeers, the answer is clearly affirmative. The second feature of\nsuch accounts is that they tend to take it that reference to the\ncapacities named in the traditional slogans is in some sense\nnormatively, in particular, ethically\nsignificant.\n\nThe first claim of such accounts, then, is that there is some property\nof contemporary humans that is in some way descriptively or causally\ncentral to participating in their form of life. The second is that\nsuch participation involves subjection to normative standards rooted\nin the possession of some such property. Importantly, there is a step\nfrom the first to the second form of significance, and justification\nof the step requires argument. Even from a participant perspective,\nthere is no automatic move from explanatory to normative\nsignificance.\n\nAccording to an \u201cinternal\u201d, participant account of human\nnature, certain capacities of contemporary, perhaps modern humans\nunavoidably structure the way they (we) live their (our)\nlives. Talk of \u201cstructuring\u201d refers to three kinds of\ncontributions to the matrix of capacities and dispositions that both\nenable and constrain the ways humans live their lives. These are\ncontributions, first, to the specific shape other features of humans\nlives have and, second, to the way other such features hang together\n(Midgley 2000: 56ff.; Roughley 2011: 16ff.). Relatedly, they also make\npossible a whole new set of practices. All three relations are\nexplanatory, although their explanatory role appears not necessarily\nto correspond to the role corresponding features, or earlier versions\nof the features, might have played in the evolutionary genealogy of\ncontemporary human psychology. Having linguistic capacities is a prime\ncandidate for the role of such a structural property: human\nperception, emotion, action planning and thought are all plausibly\ntransformed in linguistic creatures, as are the connections between\nperception and belief, and the myriad relationships between thought\nand behaviour, connections exploited and deepened in a rich set of\npractices unavailable to non-linguistic animals. Similar things could\nbe claimed for other properties named by the traditional slogans.\n\nIn contrast to the ways in which such capacities have frequently been\nreferred to in the slogan mode, particularly to the pathos that has\ntended to accompany it, it seems highly implausible that any one such\nproperty will stand alone as structurally significant. It is more\nlikely that we should be picking out a constellation of properties, a\nconstellation that may well include properties variants of which are\npossessed by other animals. Other properties, including capacities\nthat may be specific to contemporary humans, such as humour, may be\nless plausible candidates for a structural role.\n\nNote that the fact that such accounts aim to answer a question asked\nfrom the participant perspective does not rule out that the features\nin question may be illuminated in their role for human\nself-understanding by data from empirical science. On the contrary, it\nseems highly likely that disciplines such as developmental and\ncomparative psychology, and neuroscience will contribute significantly\nto an understanding of the possibilities and constraints inherent in\nthe relevant capacities and in the way they interact.\n5.2. Human Nature and the Human ergon\n\nThe paradigmatic strategy for deriving ethical consequences from\nclaims about structural features of the human life form is the\nPlatonic and Aristotelian ergon or function argument. The\nfirst premise of Aristotle\u2019s version (Nicomachean\nEthics 1097b\u20131098a) connects function and goodness: if the\ncharacteristic function of an entity of a type X is to \u03c6,\nthen a good entity of type X is one that \u03c6s well. Aristotle\nconfers plausibility on the claim by using examples such as social\nroles and bodily organs. If the function of an eye as an exemplar of\nits kind is to enable seeing, then a good eye is one that enables its\nbearer to see well. The second premise of the argument is a claim we\nencountered in\n section 1.4\n of this entry, a claim we can now see as predicating a structural\nproperty of human life, the exercise of reason. According to this\nclaim, the function or end of individual humans as humans is,\ndepending on interpretation (Nussbaum 1995: 113ff.), either the\nexercise of reason or life according to reason. If this is correct, it\nfollows that a good human being is one whose life centrally involves\nthe exercise of, or life in accordance with, reason.\n\nIn the light of the discussion so far, it ought to be clear that, as\nit stands, the second premise of this argument is incompatible with\nthe evolutionary biology of species. It asserts that the exercise of\nreason is not only the key structural property of human life, but also\nthe realization of the fully developed human form. No sense can be\nmade of this latter notion in evolutionary terms. Nevertheless, a\nseries of prominent contemporary ethicists\u2014Alasdair MacIntyre\n(1999), Rosalind Hursthouse (1999), Philippa Foot (2001) and Martha\nNussbaum (2006)\u2014have all made variants of the ergon\nargument central to their ethical theories. As each of these authors\nadvance some version of the second premise, it is instructive to\nexamine the ways in which they aim to avoid the challenge from\nevolutionary biology.\n\nBefore doing so, it is first worth noting that any ethical theory or\ntheory of value is engaged in an enterprise that has no clear place in\nan evolutionary analysis. If we want to know what goodness is or what\n\u201cgood\u201d means, evolutionary theory is not the obvious place\nto look. This is particularly clear in view of the fact that\nevolutionary theory operates at the level of populations (Sober 1980:\n370; Walsh 2006: 434), whereas ethical theory operates, at least\nprimarily, at the level of individual agents. However, the specific\nconflict between evolutionary biology and neo-Aristotelian ethics\nresults from the latter\u2019s constructive use of the concept of\nspecies and, in particular, of a teleological conception of a fully\ndeveloped form of individual members of the species\n\u201cqua members of [the] species\u201d (MacIntyre 1999:\n64, 71; cf. Thompson 2008: 29; Foot 2001: 27). The characterisation of\nachieving that form as fulfilling a \u201cfunction\u201d, which\nhelps the analogy with bodily organs and social roles, is frequently\nreplaced in contemporary discussions by talk of\n\u201cflourishing\u201d (Aristotle\u2019s eudaimonia).\nSuch talk more naturally suggests comparisons with the lives of other\norganisms (although Aristotle himself excludes other animals from\neudaimonia; cf. Nicomachean Ethics 1009b). The\nconcept of flourishing in turn picks out\nbiological\u2014etymologically: botanical\u2014processes, but again\nnot of a sort that play a role in evolutionary theory. It also seems\nprimarily predicated of individual organisms. It may play a role in\necology; it is, however, most clearly at home in practical\napplications of biological knowledge, as in horticulture. In this\nrespect, it is comparable to the concept of health.\n\nNeo-Aristotelians claim that to describe an organism, whether a plant\nor a non-human or human animal, as flourishing is to measure it\nagainst a standard that is specific to the species to which it\nbelongs. To do so is to evaluate it as a more or less good\n\u201cspecimen of its species (or sub-species)\u201d (Hursthouse\n1999: 198). The key move is then to claim that moral evaluation is,\n\u201cquite seriously\u201d (Foot 2001: 16), evaluation of the same\nsort: just as a non-defective animal or plant exemplifies flourishing\nwithin the relevant species\u2019 life form, someone who is morally\ngood is someone who exemplifies human flourishing, i.e., the fully\ndeveloped form of the species. This metaethical claim has provoked the\nworry as to whether such attributions to other organisms are really\nanything more than classifications, or at most evaluations of\n\u201cstretched and deflated\u201d kinds that are missing the key\nfeature of authority that we require for genuine normativity (Lenman\n2005: 46ff.).\n5.2.1. Sidestepping the Darwinian Challenge?\n\nIndependently of questions concerning their theory of value, ethical\nNeo-Aristotelians need to respond to the question of how reference to\na fully developed form of the species can survive the challenge from\nevolutionary theory. Three kinds of response may appear promising.\n\nThe first adverts to the plurality of forms of biological\nscience, claiming that there are life sciences, such as physiology,\nbotany, zoology and ethology in the context of which such evaluations\nhave a place (Hursthouse 1999: 202; 2012: 172; MacIntyre 1999: 65).\nAnd if ethology can legitimately attribute not only characteristic\nfeatures, but also defects or flourishing to species members, in spite\nof species not being natural kinds, then there is little reason why\nethics shouldn\u2019t do so too. This strategy might ground in one of\nthe moves sketched in\n section 3.1\n of this entry. It might be argued, with Kitcher and Dupr\u00e9,\nthat such attributions are legitimate in other branches of biological\nscience because there is a plurality of species concepts, indeed of\nkinds of species, where these are relative to epistemic interests. Or\nthe claim might simply rest on a difference in what is taken to be the\nrelevant time frame, where temporal relevance is indexed relative to\nthe present. In ethics we are, it might be claimed, interested in\nhumans as they are \u201cat the moment and for a few millennia back\nand for maybe not much longer in the future\u201d (Hursthouse 2012:\n171).\n\nThis move amounts to the concession that talk of \u201cthe human\nspecies\u201d is not to be understood literally. Whether this\nconcession undermines the ethical theories that use the term is\nperhaps unclear. It leaves open the possibility that, as human nature\nmay change significantly, there may be significant changes in what it\nmeans for humans to flourish and therefore in what is ethically\nrequired. This might be seen as a virtue, rather than a vice of the\nview.\n\nA second response to the challenge from evolutionary biology\naims to draw metaphysical consequences from epistemic or semantic\nclaims. Michael Thompson has argued that what he calls alternatively\n\u201cthe human life form\u201d and \u201cthe human species\u201d\nis an a priori category. Thompson substantiates this claim by\nexamining forms of discourse touched on in\n section 3.2,\n forms of discourse that are generally taken to be of mere heuristic\nimportance for amateur practices of identification, viz. field guides\nor animal documentaries. Statements such as \u201cThe domestic cat\nhas four legs, two eyes, two ears and guts in its belly\u201d, are,\nThompson claims, instances of an important kind of predication that is\nneither tensed nor quantifiable. He calls these \u201cnatural\nhistorical descriptions\u201d or \u201cAristotelian\ncategoricals\u201d (Thompson 2008: 64ff.). Such generic claims are\nnot, he argues, made false where what is predicated is less than\nuniversal, or even statistically rare. Decisively, according to\nThompson, our access to the notion of the human life form is\nnon-empirical. It is, he claims, a presupposition of understanding\nourselves from the first-person perspective as breathing, eating or\nfeeling pain (Thompson 2004: 66ff.). Thus understood, the concept is\nindependent of biology and therefore, if coherent, immune to problems\nraised by the Darwinian challenge.\n\nLike Foot and Hursthouse, Thompson thinks that his Aristotelian\ncategoricals allow inferences to specific judgments that members of\nspecies are defective (Thompson 2004: 54ff.; 2008: 80). He admits that\nsuch judgments in the case of the human life form are likely to be\nfraught with difficulties, but nevertheless believes that judgments of\n(non-)defective realization of a life form are the model for ethical\nevaluation (Thompson 2004: 30, 81f.). It may seem unclear how this\nmight be the case in view of the fact that access to the human life\nform is supposed to be given as a presupposition of using the concept\nof \u201cI\u201d. Another worry is that the everyday understanding\non which Thompson draws may be nothing other than a branch of folk\nbiology. The folk tendency to ascribe teleological essences to\nspecies, as to \u201craces\u201d and genders, is no indication of\nthe reality of such essences (Lewens 2012: 469f.; Stotz &\nGriffiths 2018: 60ff.; cf. Pellegrin 1982 [1986: 16ff., 120] and\nCharles 2000: 343ff., 368, on Aristotle\u2019s own orientation to the\nusage of \u201cthe people\u201d).\n\nA final response to evolutionary biologists\u2019 worries\naims equally to distinguish the Neo-Aristotelian account of human\nnature from that of the sciences. However, it does so not by\nintroducing a special metaphysics of \u201clife forms\u201d, but by\nexplicitly constructing an ethical concept of human nature. Martha\nNussbaum argues that the notion of human nature in play in what she\ncalls \u201cAristotelian essentialism\u201d is, as she puts it,\n\u201cinternal and evaluative\u201d. It is a hermeneutic product of\n\u201chuman\u201d self-understanding, constructed from within our\nbest ethical outlook: \u201can ethical theory of human nature\u201d,\nshe claims,\n\n\nshould force us to answer for ourselves, on the basis of our very own\nethical judgment, the question which beings are fully human ones.\n(Nussbaum 1995: 121f.; cf. Nussbaum 1992: 212ff.; 2006: 181ff.;\nMcDowell 1980 [1998: 18ff.]; Hursthouse 1999: 229; 2012: 174f.)\n\n\nThere can be no question here of moving from a biological\n\u201cis\u201d to an ethical \u201cought\u201d; rather, which\nfeatures are taken to belong to human nature is itself seen as the\nresult of ethical deliberation. Such a conception maintains the claim\nthat the key ethical standard is that of human flourishing. However,\nit is clear that what counts as flourishing can only be specified on\nthe basis of ethical deliberation, understood as striving for\nreflective equilibrium (Nussbaum 2006: 352ff.). In view of such a\nmethodological proposal, there is a serious question as to what work\nis precisely done by the concept of human nature.\n5.2.2. Human Flourishing\n\nNeo-Aristotelians vary in the extent to which they flesh out a\nconception of species-specific flourishing. Nussbaum draws up a\ncomprehensive, open-ended catalogue of what she calls \u201cthe\ncentral human capacities\u201d. These are in part picked out because\nof their vulnerability to undermining or support by political\nmeasures. They include both basic bodily needs and more specifically\nhuman capacities, such as for humour, play, autonomy and practical\nreason (Nussbaum 1992: 216ff.; 2006: 76ff.). Such a catalogue allows\nthe setting of three thresholds, below which a human organism would\nnot count as living a human life at all (anencephalic\nchildren, for instance), as living a fully human life or as\nliving a good human life (Nussbaum 2006: 181). Nussbaum\nexplicitly argues that being of human parents is insufficient for\ncrossing the first, evaluatively set threshold. Her conception is\npartly intended to provide guidelines as to how societies should\nconceive disability and as to when it is appropriate to take political\nmeasures in order to enable agents with nonstandard physical or mental\nconditions to cross the second and third thresholds.\n\nNussbaum has been careful to insist that enabling independence, rather\nthan providing care, should be the prime aim. Nevertheless, the\nstructure of an account that insists on a \u201cspecies norm\u201d,\nbelow which humans lacking certain capacities count as less than fully\nflourishing, has prompted accusations of illiberality. According to\nthe complaint, it disrespects the right of members of, for example,\ndeaf communities to set the standards for their own forms of life\n(Glackin 2016: 320ff.).\n\nOther accounts of species-specific flourishing have been considerably\nmore abstract. According to Hursthouse, plants flourish when their\nparts and operations are well suited to the ends of individual\nsurvival and continuance of the species. In social animals,\nflourishing also tends to involve characteristic pleasure and freedom\nfrom pain, and a contribution to appropriate functioning of relevant\nsocial groups (Hursthouse 1999: 197ff.). The good of human character\ntraits conducive to pursuit of these four ends is transformed,\nHursthouse claims, by the addition of \u201crationality\u201d. As a\nresult, humans flourish when they do what they correctly take\nthemselves to have reason to do\u2014under the constraint that they\ndo not thereby cease to foster the four ends set for other social\nanimals (Hursthouse 1999: 222ff.). Impersonal benevolence is, for\nexample, because of this constraint, unlikely to be a virtue. In such\nan ethical outlook, what particular agents have reason to do is the\nprimary standard; it just seems to be applied under particular\nconstraints. A key question is thus whether the content of this\nprimary standard is really determined by the notion of\nspecies-specific flourishing.\n\nWhere Hursthouse\u2019s account builds up to, and attempts to provide\na \u201cnatural\u201d framework for, the traditional Aristotelian\nergon of reason, MacIntyre builds his account around the\nclaim that flourishing specific to the human \u201cspecies\u201d is\nessentially a matter of becoming an \u201cindependent practical\nreasoner\u201d (MacIntyre 1999: 67ff.). It is because of the central\nimportance of reasoning that, although human flourishing shares\ncertain preconditions with the flourishing, say, of dolphins, it is\nalso vulnerable in specific ways. MacIntyre argues that particular\nkinds of social practices enable the development of human reasoning\ncapacities and that, because independent practical reasoning is,\nparadoxically, at core cooperatively developed and structured, the\ngeneral aim of human flourishing is attained by participation in\nnetworks in local communities (MacIntyre 1999: 108).\n\u201cIndependent practical reasoners\u201d are \u201cdependent\nrational animals\u201d. MacIntyre\u2019s account thus makes room on\nan explanatory level for the evolutionary insight that humans can only\nbecome rational in a socio-cultural context which provides scaffolding\nfor the development and exercise of rationality\n (\u00a74).\n Normatively, however, this point is subordinated to the claim that,\nfrom the point of view of participation in the contemporary human life\nform, flourishing corresponds to the traditional slogan.\n5.3. Reason as the Unique Structural Property\n\nMacIntyre, Hursthouse and Nussbaum (Nussbaum 2006: 159f.) all aim to\nlocate the human capacity for reasoning within a framework that\nencompasses other animals. Each argues that, although the capacities\nto recognise reasons as reasons and for deliberation on their basis\ntransform the needs and abilities humans share with other animals, the\nreasons in question remain in some way dependent on humans\u2019\nembodied and social form of life. This emphasis is intended to\ndistinguish an Aristotelian approach from other approaches for which\nthe capacity to evaluate reasons for action as reasons and to distance\noneself from ones desires is also the \u201ccentral difference\u201d\nbetween humans and other animals (Korsgaard 2006: 104; 2018: 38ff.;\ncf. MacIntyre 1999: 71ff.). According to Korsgaard\u2019s Kantian\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s ergon argument, humans\ncannot act without taking a normative stand on whether their desires\nprovide them with reasons to act. This she takes to be the key\nstructural feature of their life, which brings with it \u201ca whole\nnew way of functioning well or badly\u201d (Korsgaard 2018: 48; cf.\n1996: 93). In such an account, \u201chuman nature\u201d is\nmonistically understood as this one structural feature which is so\ntransformative that the concept of life applicable to organisms that\ninstantiate it is no longer that applicable to organisms that\ndon\u2019t. Only \u201chumans\u201d live their lives,\nbecause only they possess the type of intentional control over their\nbodily movements that grounds in evaluation of their actions and\nself-evaluation as agents (Korsgaard 2006: 118; 2008: 141ff.; cf.\nPlessner 1928 [1975: 309f.]).\n\nWe have arrived at an interpretation of the traditional slogan that\ncuts it off from a metaphysics with any claims to be\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d. The claim now is that the structural\neffect of the capacity for reasoning transforms those features of\nhumans that they share with other animals so thoroughly that those\nfeatures pale into insignificance. What is \u201cnatural\u201d about\nthe capacity for reasoning for humans here is its unavoidability for\ncontemporary members of the species, at least for those without\nserious mental disabilities. Such assertions also tend to shade into\nnormative claims that discount the normative status of\n\u201canimal\u201d needs in view of the normative authority of human\nreasoning (cf. McDowell 1996 [1998: 172f.]).\n\nThe most radical version of this thought leads to the claim\nencountered towards the end of\n section 1.4:\n that talk of \u201chuman nature\u201d involves no essential\nreference at all to the species Homo sapiens or to the\nhominin lineage. According to this view, the kind to which\ncontemporary humans belong is a kind to which entities could also\nbelong who have no genealogical relationship to humans. That kind is\nthe kind of entities that act and believe in accordance with the\nreasons they take themselves to have. Aliens, synthetically created\nagents and angels are further candidates for membership in the kind,\nwhich would, unlike biological taxa, be spatiotemporally unrestricted.\nThe traditional term for the kind, as employed by Aquinas and Kant, is\n\u201cperson\u201d (cf. Hull 1986: 9).\n\nRoger Scruton has recently taken this line, arguing that persons can\nonly be adequately understood in terms of a web of concepts\ninapplicable to other animals, concepts whose applicability grounds in\nan essential moral dimension of the personal life form. The concepts\npick out components of a life form that is permeated by relationships\nof responsibility, as expressed in reactive attitudes such as\nindignation, guilt and gratitude. Such emotions he takes to involve a\ndemand for accountability, and as such to be exclusive to the personal\nlife form, not variants of animal emotions (Scruton 2017: 52). As a\nresult, he claims, they situate their bearers in some sense\n\u201coutside the natural order\u201d (Scruton 2017: 26). According\nto such an account, we should embrace a methodological dualism with\nrespect to humans: as animals, they are subject to the same kinds of\nbiological explanations as all other organisms, but as persons, they\nare subject to explanations that are radically different in kind.\nThese are explanations in terms of reasons and meanings, that is,\nexercises in \u201cVerstehen\u201d, whose applicability Scruton\ntakes to be independent of causal explanation (Scruton 2017: 30ff.,\n46).\n\nSuch an account demonstrates with admirable clarity that there is no\nnecessary connection between a theory of \u201chuman nature\u201d\nand metaphysical naturalism. It also reinforces the fact, emphasised\nthroughout this entry, that discussions of \u201chuman nature\u201d\nrequire both serious conceptual spadework and explicit justification\nof the use of any one such concept rather than another.\n",
