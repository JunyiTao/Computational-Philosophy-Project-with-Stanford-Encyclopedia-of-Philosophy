    "main_text": "New Foundations and Related Systems || The consistency problem for NF; the known consistent subsystems\n6.2 The consistency problem for NF; the known consistent subsystems\n\nNo contradictions are known to follow from NF, but some\nuncomfortable consequences do follow. The Axiom of Choice is known to\nfail in NF: Specker (1953) proved that the universe cannot be\nwell-ordered. (Since the universe cannot be well-ordered, it follows\nthat the \u201cAxiom\u201d of Infinity is a theorem of NF:\nif the universe were finite, it could be well-ordered.) This might be\nthought to be what one would expect on adopting such a dangerous\ncomprehension scheme, but this turns out not to be the problem. The\nproblem is with extensionality.\n\nJensen (1968) showed that NFU (New Foundations with\nurelements), the version of New Foundations in which extensionality is\nweakened to allow many non-sets (as described above under naive set\ntheory) is consistent, is consistent with Infinity and Choice, and is\nalso consistent with the negation of Infinity (which of course implies\nChoice). NFU, which has the full stratified comprehension\naxiom of NF with all its frighteningly big sets, is weaker in\nconsistency strength than Peano arithmetic; NFU + Infinity +\nChoice is of the same strength as TST with Infinity and\nChoice or Mac Lane set theory.\n\nSome other fragments of NF, obtained by weakening\ncomprehension rather than extensionality, are known to be consistent.\nNF3, the version of NF in which one\naccepts only those instances of the axiom of comprehension which can\nbe typed using three types, was shown to be consistent by Grishin\n(1969).\n\nNFP (predicative NF), the version of NF in\nwhich one accepts only instances of the axiom of comprehension which\ncan be typed so as to be instances of comprehension of predicative\nTST (described above under type theories) was shown to be\nconsistent by Marcel Crabb\u00e9 (1982). He also demonstrated the\nconsistency of the theory NFI in which one allows all\ninstances of stratified comprehension in which no variable appears of\ntype higher than that assigned to the set being defined (bound\nvariables of the same type as that of the set being defined are\npermitted, which allows some impredicativity). One would like to read\nthe name NFI as \u201cimpredicative NF\u201d but\none cannot, as it is more impredicative than NFP, not more\nimpredicative than NF itself.\n\nNF3+Infinity has the same strength as second-order\narithmetic. So does NFI (which has just enough\nimpredicativity to define the natural numbers, and not enough for the\nLeast Upper Bound Axiom). NFP is equivalent to a weaker\nfragment of arithmetic, but does (unlike NFU) prove Infinity:\nthis is the only application of the Specker proof of the negation of\nthe Axiom of Choice to a provably consistent theory. Either Union is\ntrue (in which case we readily get all of NF and\nSpecker\u2019s proof of Infinity goes through) or Union is not true,\nin which case we note that all finite sets have unions, so there must\nbe an infinite set. NF3 has considerable interest\nfor a surprising reason: it turns out that all infinite\nmodels of TST3 (simple type theory with three\ntypes) satisfy the ambiguity schema \\(\\phi \\equiv \\phi^+\\) (of course\nthis only makes sense for formulas with one or two types) and this\nturns out to be enough to show that for any infinite model of\nTST3 there is a model of NF3\nwith the same theory. NF4 is the same theory as\nNF (Grishin 1969), and we have no idea how to get a model of\nTST4 to satisfy ambiguity.\n\nVery recently, Sergei Tupailo (2010) has proved the consistency of\nNFSI, the fragment of NF consisting of\nextensionality and those instances of Comprehension (\\(\\{x \\in A \\mid\n\\phi \\}\\) exists) which are stratified and in which the variable \\(x\\)\nis assigned the lowest type. Tupailo\u2019s proof is highly\ntechnical, but Marcel Crabb\u00e9 pointed out that a structure for\nthe language of set theory in which the sets are exactly the finite\nand cofinite collections satisfies this theory (so it is very weak).\nIt should be noted that Tupailo\u2019s model of NFSI\nsatisfies additional propositions of interest not satisfied by the\nvery simple model of Crabb\u00e9, such as the existence of each\nFrege natural number. It is of some interest whether this new fragment\nrepresents an independent way of getting a consistent fragment of\nNF. Note that NFU+NFSI is NF\nbecause NFSI has strong extensionality. Also,\nNFP+NFSI is NF because NFSI\nincludes Union. The relationship of NFSI to NF\\(_3\\)\nhas been clarified by Marcel Crabb\u00e9 in 2016. Tupailo\u2019s\ntheory is shown not to be a fragment of Grishin\u2019s, and thus\nrepresents a fourth known method of getting consistent fragments.\n",
