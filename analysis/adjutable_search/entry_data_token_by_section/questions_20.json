    "main_text": "Embedded (or indirect) questions || Wh-complements as predicates\n4.6 Wh-complements as predicates\n\nBrogaard (2009) rejects both reductionist views (which, like\nHintikka\u2019s, reduce knowledge-wh to knowledge-that) and\nanti-reductionist views (which, like Schaffer\u2019s, analyze\nknowledge-wh as question-relative knowledge-that), arguing instead\nthat wh-complements are predicates and knowledge-wh is a special kind\nof de re knowledge. For example, on Brogaard\u2019s view, the logical\nform of (48c) is:\n\n(49) \\(\\exists x\\)\n(John knows that \\(x\\) is what is on the mat) \n\n\nA disadvantage of Brogaard\u2019s de re approach, Masto (2016)\nargues, is that the de re approach does not generalize to certain\nother attitude verbs that take wh-clauses as complements. For example,\nthere is no de re reading of (50):\n\n(50) John wonders what\nis on the mat.\n\n\nThat is, (50) cannot be read as meaning that there is a particular x\nabout which John has some relevant de re attitude of wonder. Part of\nthe problem is that whereas \u2018know\u2019 takes both\npropositional and interrogative complements, \u2018wonder\u2019\ntakes interrogative complements but not propositional complements.\nThis difference between \u2018know\u2019 and \u2018wonder\u2019 is\nthe distinction between responsive and rogative predicates, which will\nbe discussed in detail in section\n 4.8,\n below.\n",
