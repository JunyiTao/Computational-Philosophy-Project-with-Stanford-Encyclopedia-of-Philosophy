Psychological Theories of Women and Work\n\nThe socialist-feminist idea that there are two interlocking systems\nthat structure gender and the economy, and thus are jointly\nresponsible for male domination, has been developed in a psychological\ndirection by the psychoanalytic school of feminist theorists.\nParticularly relevant to the question of women and work are the\ntheories of Mitchell (1972, 1974), Kuhn and Wolpe (1978), Chodorow\n(1978, 1979, 1982) and Ruddick (1989). Mothering, or, taking care of\nbabies and small children, as a type of work done overwhelmingly by\nwomen, socializes women and men to have different identities,\npersonalities and skills. In her first work (1972), Mitchell argues\nthat women\u2019s different relations to productive work,\nreproduction, socialization of children and sexuality in patriarchy\ngive her lesser economic and psychological power in relation to men.\nIn a Freudian vein, Mitchell later argues (1974) that women learn that\nthey are not full symbolic subjects because compulsory heterosexuality\nand the incest taboo bar them from meeting either the desire of their\nmother or any other woman. Chodorow, also reading Freud from a\nfeminist perspective, suggests that women\u2019s predominance in\nmothering work is the basis for the learned gender distinction between\nwomen and men. The sexual division of infant care gives boys, who must\nlearn their masculine identity by separating from their mother and the\nfeminine, a motive for deprecating, as well as dominating, women.\nRuddick from a more Aristotelian perspective suggests that it is the\nskills and virtues required in the practice of mothering work which\nnot only socially construct feminine gender differently from\nmen\u2019s, but could ground an alternative vision for peace and\nresolving human conflicts, if a peace movement were led by women.\n\nFerguson argues that the \u201csex/affective\u201d work of mothering\nand wifely nurturing is exploitative of women: women give more\nnurturance and satisfaction (including sexual satisfaction) to men and\nchildren than they receive, and do much more of the work of providing\nthese important human goods (cf. also Bartky 1990). The gendered\ndivision of labor has both economic and psychological consequences,\nsince women\u2019s caring labor creates women less capable of or\nmotivated to separate from others, and hence less likely to protest\nsuch gender exploitation (Ferguson 1989, 1991). Folbre argues by\ncontrast that it is only because women\u2019s bargaining power is\nless than men\u2019s because of the power relations involved in the\ngender division of labor and property that women acquiesce to such\ninequalities (Folbre 1982). Ferguson argues that gendered exploitation\nin a system of meeting human needs suggests that women can be seen as\na \u201csex class\u201d (or gender class) which cuts across economic\nclass lines (1979, 1989, 1991). This line of thought is also developed\nby Christine Delphy (1984), Monique Wittig (1980) and Luce Irigaray\n(1975).\n\nOn the other side of the debate, Brenner (2000) argues that women are\nnot uniformly exploited by men across economic class lines: indeed,\nfor working class women their unpaid work as housewives serves the\nworking class as a whole, because the whole class benefits when its\ndaily and future reproduction needs are met by women\u2019s nurturing\nand childcare work. They argue further that middle and upper class\nwomen\u2019s economic privileges will inevitably lead them to betray\nworking class women in any cross-class alliance that is not explicitly\nanti-capitalist. Hochschild (2000) and hooks (2000) point out that\ncareer women tend to pay working class women to do the second shift\nwork in the home so they can avoid that extra work, and they have an\ninterest in keeping such wages, e.g., for house cleaning and nannies,\nas low as possible to keep the surplus for themselves. Kollias (1981)\nargues further that working class women are in a stronger political\nposition to work effectively for women\u2019s liberation than middle\nclass women, while McKenny (1981) argues that professional women have\nto overcome myths of professionalism that keep them feeling superior\nto working class women and hence unable to learn from or work with\nthem for social change.\n",
