    "main_text": "Problems and Questions || Unlimited evidence generation?\n4.3 Unlimited evidence generation?\n\nPerhaps the only possible case for asymptotic infallibility involves\nthe idea of unlimited evidence generation (or \u201cgenerated\nsignals\u201d in the words of Hong & Page 2009). What does this\nmean, and how plausible is it?\n\nAssume that each individual accesses independent private information,\non which alone their judgment is based, without any information\nsharing or dependence on common influences (assumed in Dietrich &\nList 2004). For instance, doctors perform independent tests on one and\nthe same patient to judge whether some virus is present, or chemists\nperform independent experiments to judge whether a liquid contains a\ngiven molecule. This private information is truth-conducive: given any\ntrue state, the information supports the true state with probability\nabove \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\u2014the same probability for each information\n(each individual). More problematically, private evidence is\nindependent given the true state. This rules out, implausibly, that\nany common causes (except the state itself) affect different private\ninformation: for instance, the patient\u2019s physiology cannot\naffect virus tests (possibly rendering all tests unreliable), and the\nliquid\u2019s acidity level cannot affect tests for the molecule\n(possibly rendering all tests unreliable). Under these questionable\nassumptions, majority judgments are asymptotically infallible, as the\n(State-)Conditional Jury Theorem applies.\n\nSuch a scenario of fully private and independent information escapes\nthe problem of common causes\n (Section 2.2)\n and the tension between independence of competence\n (Section 2.4),\n but only by excluding hidden common influences, excluding\ninformational exchange between individuals, postulating an ever\nextendable rather than fixed body of information, and thereby\nindirectly excluding underdetermination of the truth discussed in\n Section 4.2.[16]\n An individual \u201ccreates\u201d new independent information (in\nthe examples: through \u201cexperiments\u201d) rather than facing\nthe same shared information as others. Increasing the group thus adds\ninformation, not interpretations of information. This unlimited\navailability of independent information might be approximately\nrealistic in decision problems where information is\nproduceable (say, through experiments) rather than merely\nobservable. But political and other real-life decision\nproblems come with a limited and possibly difficult body of known or\nknowable facts, causing asymptotic fallibility.\n",
