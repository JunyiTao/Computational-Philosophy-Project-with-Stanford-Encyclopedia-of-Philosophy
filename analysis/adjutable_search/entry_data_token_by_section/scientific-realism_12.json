    "main_text": "Antirealism: Foils for Scientific Realism || Social Constructivism\n4.3 Social Constructivism\n\nOne outcome of the historical turn in the philosophy of science and\nits emphasis on scientific practice was a focus on the complex social\ninteractions that inevitably surround and infuse the generation of\nscientific knowledge. Relations between experts, their students, and\nthe public, collaboration and competition between individuals and\ninstitutions, and social, economic, and political contexts became the\nsubjects of an approach to studying the sciences known as the\nsociology of scientific knowledge, or SSK. Though in theory, a\ncommitment to studying the sciences from a sociological perspective is\ninterpretable in such a way as to be neutral with respect to realism\n(Lewens 2005; cf. Kochan 2010), in practice, most accounts of science\ninspired by SSK are implicitly or explicitly antirealist. This\nantirealism in practice stems from the common suggestion that once one\nappreciates the role that social factors (using this as a generic term\nfor the sorts of interactions and contexts indicated above) play in\nthe production of scientific knowledge, a philosophical commitment to\nsome form of \u201csocial constructivism\u201d is inescapable, and\nthis latter commitment is inconsistent with various aspects of\nrealism.\n\nThe term \u201csocial construction\u201d refers to any\nknowledge-generating process in which what counts as a fact is\nsubstantively determined by social factors, and in which different\nsocial factors would likely generate facts that are inconsistent with\nwhat is actually produced. The important implication here is thus a\ncounterfactual claim about the dependence of facts on social factors.\nThere are numerous ways in which social determinants of facthood may\nbe consistent with realism. For example, social factors might\ndetermine the directions and methodologies of research that are\npermitted, encouraged, and funded, but this by itself need not\nundermine a realist attitude with respect to the outputs of scientific\nwork. Often, however, work in SSK takes the form of case studies that\naim to demonstrate how particular decisions affecting scientific work\nwere (or are) influenced by social factors which, had they been\ndifferent, would have facilitated results that are inconsistent with\nthose ultimately accepted as scientific fact. Some, including\nproponents of the so-called Strong Program in SSK, argue that for more\ngeneral, principled reasons, such factual contingency is inevitable.\n(For a sample of influential approaches to social constructivism, see\nLatour & Woolgar [1979] 1986; Knorr-Cetina 1981; Pickering 1984;\nShapin & Schaffer 1985; and Collins & Pinch 1993; on the\nStrong Program, see Barnes, Bloor, & Henry 1996; for a historical\nstudy of the transition from Kuhn to SSK and social constructivism,\nsee Zammito 2004: chs. 5\u20137.)\n\nBy making social factors an inextricable, substantive determinant of\nwhat counts as true or false in the realm of the sciences (and\nelsewhere), social constructivism stands opposed to the realist\ncontention that theories can be understood as furnishing knowledge of\na mind-independent world. And as in the historicist approach, notions\nsuch as truth, reference, and ontology are here relative to particular\ncontexts; they have no context-transcendent significance. The later\nwork of Kuhn and Wittgenstein in particular were influential in the\ndevelopment of the Strong Program doctrine of \u201cmeaning\nfinitism\u201d, according to which the meanings of terms are\nconceived as social institutions: the various ways in which they are\nused successfully in communication within a linguistic community. This\ntheory of meaning forms the basis of an argument to the effect that\nthe meanings of scientific (and other) terms are products of social\nnegotiation and need not be fixed or determinate, which further\nconflicts with a number of realist notions, including the idea of\nconvergence toward true theories, improvements with respect to\nontology or approximate truth, and determinate reference to\nmind-independent entities. The subject of neo-Kantianism thus emerges\nhere again, though its strength in constructivist doctrines varies\nsignificantly. (For a robustly finitist view, see Kusch 2002; for a\nmore moderate constructivism, see Putnam\u2019s (1981: ch. 3)\n\u201cinternal realism\u201d and cf. Ellis 1988).\n",
