Explaining Collective Action\n\n\nThe facts that there is a lot of collective action even in many\nlarge-number contexts in which the individuals do not have rich\nrelationships with each other and that, therefore, many people are not\nfree riding in relevant contexts suggest at least three possibilities.\nFirst, there are ways to affect the incentives of group members to make\nit their interest to contribute. Second, motivations other than\nself-interest may be in play. Third, the actors in the seemingly\nsuccessful collective actions fail to understand their own interests.\nEach of these possibilities is important and interesting, and the\nlatter two are philosophically interesting. Each is also supported by\nextensive empirical evidence.\n\n\nIn the first category are the by-product theory proposed by\nOlson and the possibility that political entrepreneurs, at\nleast partially acting in their own interest, can engineer provisions.\nIn the by-product theory, I might contribute to my group\u2019s effort\nbecause the group ties my contribution to provision of some private\ngood that I want, such as participation in the Sierra Club\u2019s outdoor\nactivities or, in the early days of unions, low-cost group-insurance\nbenefits not available in the market. Such private goods can commonly\nbe provided in the market, so that their usefulness may eventually be\nundercut. Indeed, firms that provide insurance benefits to their\nemployees thereby undercut one of the appeals of union membership. The\ngeneral decline of American unions in recent decades is partially the\nresult of their success in resolving problems for workers in ways that\ndo not require continuing union effort.\n\n\nWhen collective goods can be supplied by government or some other\nagency, political entrepreneurs might organize the provision. For\nexample, Senator Howard Metzenbaum worked to get legislation on behalf\nof the poor and of unions, although he was certainly not poor and was\nnot himself a working member of a union. Yet he benefited from his\nefforts in support of these groups if they voted to keep him in office.\nBecause there is government, collective action of many kinds is far\nmore likely than we might expect from the dismal logic of collective\naction.\n\n\nTurn now to the assumption of self-interest. In generalizing from\nthe motive of self-interest to the explanation and even justification\nof actions and institutions, Hobbes wished to reduce political theory\nto an analog of geometry or physics, so that it would be a deductive\nscience. All of the statements of the logic of collective action above\nare grounded in an assumption of the self-interested incentives of the\nactors. When the number of members of a group that would benefit from\ncollective action is small enough, we might expect cooperation that\nresults from extensive interaction, mutual monitoring, and even\ncommitments to each other that trump or block narrowly self-interested\nactions. But when the group is very large, free riding is often clearly\nin the interest of most and perhaps all members.\n\n\nAgainst the assumption of purely self-interested behavior, we know\nthat there are many active, more or less well funded groups that seek\ncollective results that serve interests other than those of their own\nmembers. For a trivial example, none of the hundreds of people who\nhave been members of the American League to Abolish Capital Punishment\nis likely to have had a personal stake in whether there is a death\npenalty (Schattschneider 1960, 26). In our time, thousands of people\nare evidently willing to die for their causes (and not simply to risk\ndying\u2014we already do that when we merely drive to a restaurant\nfor dinner).  Perhaps some of these people act from a belief that they\nwill receive an eternal reward for their actions, so that their\nactions are consistent with their interests.\n\n\nFinally turn to the possible role of misunderstanding in leading\npeople to act for collective provisions. Despite the fact that people\nregularly grasp the incentive to free ride on the efforts of others in\nmany contexts, it is also true that the logic of collective action is\nhard to grasp in the abstract. The cursory history above suggests just\nhow hard it was to come to a general understanding of the problem.\nToday, there are thousands of social scientists and philosophers who do\nunderstand it and maybe far more who still do not. But in the general\npopulation, few people grasp it. Those who teach these issues regularly\ndiscover that some students insist that the logic is wrong, that it is,\nfor example, in the interest of workers to pay dues voluntarily to\nunions or that it is in one\u2019s interest to vote. If the latter is true,\nthen about half of voting-age Americans evidently act against their own\ninterests every quadrennial election year. It would be extremely\ndifficult to assess how large is the role of misunderstanding in the\nreasons for action in general because those who do not understand the\nissues cannot usefully be asked whether they do understand. But the\nevidence of misunderstanding and ignorance is extensive (Hardin\n2002).\n",
