    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nThere are exactly three more or less solid facts on the basis of which\none can reconstruct the general parameters of Olympiodorus\u2019 life.\nFirst, he held the chair of philosophy in Alexandria (the majority of\nmanuscripts of his work refer to him as \u201cthe philosopher of\nAlexandria\u201d). Second, he saw himself as intellectual heir to\nAmmonius (see in Meteor. 153,7; 175,14; 188,36; 238,19;\n255,23; 256,27; Olympiodorus refers to Ammonius frequently as\n\u201cthe great philosopher\u201d, in one case as \u201cour\nphilosopher\u201d, in Gorg.  \u00a740.5; cf. \u00a739.2, and\nhe may have been Ammonius\u2019 pupil).  Third, some of his lectures were\ndelivered not long after 565 (cf.  in Meteor. 52,31; the way\nOlympiodorus reminds his students about a comet that had appeared in\nMarch/April 565 suggests that the event occurred a couple of years\nearlier). It is generally assumed that Ammonius passed away (or at\nleast stopped teaching) sometime in the period between 517 and 526. If\nthese dates are correct, we can infer that Olympiodorus was a young\nman when he came to be one of the last pupils of Ammonius and that he\nled an active intellectual life into his late sixties, or early\nseventies of that century. Accordingly, the dates of Olympiodorus\u2019\nlife should be approximately 500\u2013570, encompassing the entire\nreign of emperor Justinian the Great (527\u2013565). Since John\nPhiloponus was teaching philosophy actively until the mid-30s (without\never holding the chair of philosophy), it seems likely that\nOlympiodorus began his teaching career around that time to become the\nofficial successor to Ammonius.\n\n\nThe best way to understand the circumstances of his life is to get a\nsense of the final period of pagan philosophy in the age of Justinian\n(for a more detailed account, see Wildberg 2005, with further\nreferences). For our purposes, the most important factor is that in\nthe age of Justinian, philosophy, as a discipline taught in schools of\nhigher education, had acquired a highly ambiguous status. On the one\nhand, almost anyone in the empire was perfectly aware of the fact that\nJustinian had, right from the beginning of his reign, taken severe\nmeasures to eradicate philosophy as a way of pagan life and learning,\nboth private and public. The closing of the Athenian School around 529\n(with an apparent expropriation of its assets) is only the most\nnotorious example. On the other hand, members of the elite were\nevidently also acutely aware that it was impossible to sustain the\nculture of the empire, both secular and clerical, without a classical\neducation, part of which was and always had been, philosophy. A\ntraining in philosophy was all the more necessary since only a firm\ngrounding in logic and ontology could prepare one in a meaningful way\nfor participation in the subtle theological debates that dominated the\nbest minds at the time, notably the intractable problem of the nature\nof Christ: Does Christ have two natures, one human, one divine, or one\ncompound nature? How can one possibly understand the side-by-side of\ndivinity and humanity in a single substance? One could not hope to\nbecome an expert in theology (then regarded as the highest form of\nphilosophy) without having exposed oneself in a serious way to the\nworks of Aristotle and Plato. And so, under the emperor who did\nperhaps more than anyone to cripple philosophy, philosophy flourished\n\u2014 in Alexandria especially, but also elsewhere \u2014 in a\nmanner unparalleled in late antiquity.\n\n\nThis is the world to which Olympiodorus belonged, a highly trained\npagan philosopher rendering his services to an (at least officially)\nentirely Christian audience. Undoubtedly, the religious\npresuppositions of his students, their needs, interests, and\nexpectations, determined to a large extent the parameters and content\nof his classes, and, as we shall see, foregrounded the need for a\nconsiderable amount of pedagogy on the part of the lecturer. It is\nclear that even if he had wanted to, Olympiodorus could not have\nexpounded the views of Plato and Aristotle with the same zeal and\nconviction as, for example, Simplicius, who had no audience to lecture\nto (once Justinian had closed the school in Athens). To be sure,\nphilosophy was alive and well in the imperial institutions, but the\nlatter were confined on all sides by the walls of orthodoxy and\nheresy. This is what has to be kept in mind before one joins the\nchorus of detractors who bewail the philosophical paucity of\nOlympiodorus\u2019 commentaries.
