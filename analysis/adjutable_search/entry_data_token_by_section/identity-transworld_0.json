    "main_text": "What is transworld identity? || Why transworld identity?\n1.1 Why transworld identity?\n\nSuppose that, in accordance with the possible-worlds framework for\ncharacterizing modal statements (statements about what is possible or\nnecessary, about what might or could have been the case, what could\nnot have been otherwise, and so on), we treat the general statement\nthat there might have been purple cows as equivalent to the statement\nthat there is some possible world in which there are purple cows, and\nthe general statement that there could not have been round squares\n(i.e., that it is necessary that there are none) as equivalent to the\nstatement that there is no possible world in which there are round\nsquares.\n\nHow are we to extend this framework to statements about what is\npossible and necessary for particular individuals\u2014what\nare known as de re modal statements (\u2018de\nre\u2019 meaning \u2018about a thing\u2019)\u2014for example,\nthat Clover, a particular (actually existing) four-legged cow, could\nnot have been a giraffe, or that she could have had just three legs? A\nnatural extension of the framework is to treat the first statement as\nequivalent to the claim that there is no possible world in which\nClover is a giraffe, and the second as equivalent to the claim that\nthere is some possible world in which Clover is three-legged. But this\nlast claim appears to imply that there is some possible world in which\nClover exists and has three legs\u2014from which it seems inescapably\nto follow that one and the same individual\u2014Clover\u2014exists\nin some merely possible world as well as in the actual world: that\nthere is an identity between Clover and some individual in another\npossible world. Similarly, it appears that the de re modal\nstatements \u2018George Eliot could have been a scientist rather than\na novelist\u2019 and \u2018Bertrand Russell might have been a\nplaywright instead of a philosopher\u2019 will come out as\n\u2018There is some possible world in which George Eliot (exists and)\nis a scientist rather than a novelist\u2019 and \u2018There is some\npossible world in which Bertrand Russell (exists and) is a playwright\nand not a philosopher\u2019. Again, each of these appears to involve\na commitment to an identity between an individual who exists in the\nactual world (Eliot, Russell) and an individual who exists in a\nnon-actual possible world.\n\nTo recapitulate: the natural extension of the possible-worlds\ninterpretation to de re modal statements involves a\ncommitment to the view that some individuals exist in more than one\npossible world, and thus to what is known as \u2018identity across\npossible worlds\u2019, or (for short) \u2018transworld\nidentity\u2019. (It is questionable whether the shorthand is really\napt. One would expect a \u2018transworld\u2019 identity to mean an\nidentity that holds across (and hence within) one world, not\nan identity that holds between objects in distinct worlds.\n(As David Lewis (1986) has pointed out, our own Trans World Airlines\nis an intercontinental, not an interplanetary, carrier.) Nevertheless,\nthe term \u2018transworld identity\u2019 is far too well established\nfor it to be sensible to try to introduce an alternative, although\n\u2018interworld identity\u2019 or even \u2018transmodal\nidentity\u2019 would in some ways be more appropriate.) But is this\ncommitment acceptable?\n",
