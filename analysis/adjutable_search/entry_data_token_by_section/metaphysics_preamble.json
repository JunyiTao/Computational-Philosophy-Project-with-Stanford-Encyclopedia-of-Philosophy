    "main_text": "\n\nIt is not easy to say what metaphysics is. Ancient and Medieval\nphilosophers might have said that metaphysics was, like chemistry or\nastrology, to be defined by its subject-matter: metaphysics was the\n\u201cscience\u201d that studied \u201cbeing as such\u201d or\n\u201cthe first causes of things\u201d or \u201cthings that do not\nchange\u201d. It is no longer possible to define metaphysics that\nway, for two reasons. First, a philosopher who denied the existence of\nthose things that had once been seen as constituting the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics\u2014first causes or unchanging\nthings\u2014would now be considered to be making thereby a\nmetaphysical assertion. Second, there are many philosophical problems\nthat are now considered to be metaphysical problems (or at least\npartly metaphysical problems) that are in no way related to first\ncauses or unchanging things\u2014the problem of free will, for\nexample, or the problem of the mental and the physical.\n\nThe first three sections of this entry examine a broad selection of\nproblems considered to be metaphysical and discuss ways in which the\npurview of metaphysics has expanded over time. We shall see that the\ncentral problems of metaphysics were significantly more unified in the\nAncient and Medieval eras. Which raises a question\u2014is there any\ncommon feature that unites the problems of contemporary metaphysics?\nThe final two sections discuss some recent theories of the nature and\nmethodology of metaphysics. We will also consider arguments that\nmetaphysics, however defined, is an impossible enterprise.\n",
