    "main_text": "Confirmation || Salmon\u2019s Objective Bayesianism\n3.2 Salmon\u2019s Objective Bayesianism\n\nLike Reichenbach, Salmon assigned Bayes\u2019 rule a crucial role in\nthe confirmation of scientific hypotheses, convinced that the\nhypothetico-deductive (H-D) method dear to logical empiricism\n\u201cis a gross oversimplification\u201d (1968b [2005: 72]) unable\nto capture essential aspects of confirmation. His main reason for\nrejecting the H-D method was its inability to accommodate\nplausibility judgments, even though many examples from the\nhistory of science show that they have entered the choice between\nalternative hypotheses. It is precisely for that reason, Salmon\nargued, that many philosophers have denied that plausibility\nconsiderations belong to the logic of science, or claimed that they\nare part of the context of discovery rather than the context of\njustification. On the contrary, for Salmon plausibility considerations\n\u201care pervasive in the sciences; they play a\nsignificant\u2014indeed, indispensable\u2014role\u201d\n(Salmon 1990d [2005: 98]). In particular, they can contribute to\nfixing the prior probability of hypotheses and hence fit very well in\nthe Bayesian scheme and as such belong in the context of\njustification. Incidentally, Salmon considered Reichenbach\u2019s\ndistinction between a context of discovery and a context of\njustification, which a number of authors deem debatable, not only\nfruitful, but even essential for a proper understanding of the nature\nof scientific knowledge.\n\nSalmon followed Reichenbach in embracing an objective version of\nBayesianism according to which prior probabilities should be\ndetermined on the basis of objective and empirical criteria. Prior\nprobabilities represent the \u201cbest estimates of the frequencies\nwith which certain kinds of hypotheses succeed\u201d (Salmon 1990d\n[2005: 102]), and must be fixed by means of (objective) criteria such\nas simplicity, symmetry and analogy. Analogy, in particular, is apt to\nsuggest comparisons with other similar theories, whose rate of success\nin the past can be assessed. Salmon conceded that priors are sometimes\nthe expression of rough estimates, and can be stated in terms of\ninterval probabilities. In any case, he regarded prior probabilities\nas an essential component of hypothesis confirmation, as testified by\nmany cases offered by the history of science. The fruitfulness of\nassuming a Bayesian perspective in studying the history of science is\nstrongly emphasized:\n\n\nWithout the Bayesian analysis, one could say that the study of the\nhistory of science might have some (at least marginal) heuristic value\nfor the scientist and philosopher of science; but with the Bayesian\nanalysis, the data provided by the history of science constitute,\nin addition, an essential segment of the evidence relevant to\nthe confirmation or disconfirmation of hypotheses. Philosophers of\nscience and creative scientists ignore this fact at their peril.\n(Salmon 1970c [2005: 92])\n\n\nSalmon identified the decisive advantage of the Bayesian method over\nthe H-D with its being a tool for theory comparison, for which reason\nhe recommended adopting its formulation in terms of ratios:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p(T_1\\mid E)}{p(T_2\\mid E)} = \\frac{p(T_1)p(E\\mid T_1)}{p(T_2)p(E\\mid T_2)} \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) are two alternative hypotheses, and E is a\npiece of evidence. Given the pivotal importance Kuhn ascribed to\ntheory comparison, Salmon regarded the Bayesian method as a way of\nbridging the gap between the vision of science as an objective and\nrational enterprise, embraced by logical empiricists, and Kuhn\u2019s\ncritique of such view (Salmon 1990d [2005]). That said, it is worth\nnoticing that taking in some of Kuhn\u2019s insights Salmon adopts a\nsomewhat moderate attitude, arguing \u201cI must state immediately\nand emphatically that I do not believe for one moment that\nscientists use algorithms for purposes of choosing among scientific\ntheories but if there were any such algorithms the theorem of Bayes\nwould be the prime candidate\u201d (Salmon 2005: 123, italics\noriginal).\n\nFurther reading: On confirmation see Crupi 2013 [2016] and\nTalbott 2001 [2016]. H\u00e1jek & Hitchcock (eds.) 2016 contains\na number of essays on probability, confirmation, probabilistic\ncausation, and related issues.\n",
