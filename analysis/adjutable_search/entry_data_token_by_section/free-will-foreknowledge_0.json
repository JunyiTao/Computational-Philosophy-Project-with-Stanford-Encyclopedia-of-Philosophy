    "main_text": "The argument for theological fatalism\n1. The argument for theological fatalism\n\nThere is a long history of debate over the soundness of the argument\nfor theological fatalism, so its soundness must not be obvious. Nelson\nPike (1965) gets the credit for clearly and forcefully presenting the\ndilemma in a way that produced an enormous body of work by both\ncompatibilists and incompatibilists, leading to more careful\nformulations of the argument.\n\nA precise version of the argument can be formulated as follows: Choose\nsome proposition about a future act that you think you will do freely,\nif any act is free. Suppose, for example, that the telephone will ring\nat 9 am tomorrow and you will either answer it or you will not. So it\nis either true that you will answer the phone at 9 am tomorrow or it\nis true that you will not answer the phone at 9 am tomorrow. The Law\nof Excluded Middle rules out any other alternative. Let T\nabbreviate the proposition that you will answer the phone tomorrow\nmorning at 9, and let us suppose that T is true. (If\nnot-T is true instead, simply substitute not-T in\nthe argument below).\n\nLet \u201cnow-necessary\u201d designate temporal necessity, the type\nof necessity that the past is supposed to have just because it is\npast. This type of necessity plays a central role in the argument and\nwe\u2019ll have more to say about it in sections\n 2.4,\n2.5,\n2.7,\n and\n 5,\n but we can begin with the intuitive idea that there is a kind of\nnecessity that a proposition has now when the content of the\nproposition is about something that occurred in the past. To say that\nit is now-necessary that milk has been spilled is to say nobody can do\nanything now about the fact that the milk has been spilled.\n\nLet \u201cGod\u201d designate a being who has infallible beliefs\nabout the future, where to say that God believes p infallibly\nis to say that God believes p and it is not possible that God\nbelieves p and p is false. It is not important for\nthe logic of the argument that God is the being worshiped by any\nparticular religion, but the motive to maintain that there is a being\nwith infallible beliefs is usually a religious one.\n\nOne more preliminary point is in order. The dilemma of infallible\nforeknowledge and human free will does not rest on the particular\nassumption of foreknowledge and does not require an analysis\nof knowledge. Most contemporary accounts of knowledge are fallibilist,\nwhich means they do not require that a person believe in a way that\ncannot be mistaken in order to have knowledge. She has knowledge just\nin case what she believes is true and she satisfies the other\nconditions for knowledge, such as having sufficiently strong evidence.\nOrdinary knowledge does not require that the belief cannot be\nfalse. For example, if I believe on strong evidence that classes begin\nat my university on a certain date, and when the day arrives, classes\ndo begin, we would normally say I knew in advance that classes would\nbegin on that date. I had foreknowledge about the date classes begin.\nBut there is nothing problematic about that kind of foreknowledge\nbecause events could have proven me wrong even though as\nevents actually turned out, they didn\u2019t prove me wrong.\nOrdinary foreknowledge does not threaten to necessitate the future\nbecause it does not require that when I know p it is not\npossible that my belief is false. The key problem, then, is the\ninfallibility of the belief about the future, and this is a problem\nwhether or not the epistemic agent with an infallible belief satisfies\nthe other conditions required by some account of knowledge, such as\nsufficient evidence. As long as an agent has an infallible belief\nabout the future, the problem arises.\n\nUsing the example of the proposition T, the argument that\ninfallible foreknowledge of T entails that you do not answer\nthe telephone freely can be formulated as follows:\nBasic Argument for Theological Fatalism\n\n(1)\nYesterday God infallibly believed T. [Supposition of infallible\nforeknowledge]\n(2)\n If E occurred\nin the past, it is now-necessary that E occurred then.\n[Principle of the Necessity of the Past]\n (3) It is now-necessary\nthat yesterday God believed T. [1, 2]\n (4) Necessarily, if\nyesterday God believed T, then T. [Definition of\n\u201cinfallibility\u201d]\n (5) If p is\nnow-necessary, and necessarily (p \u2192 q), then\nq is now-necessary. [Transfer of Necessity Principle]\n (6) So it is now-necessary\nthat T. [3,4,5]\n (7) If it is now-necessary\nthat T, then you cannot do otherwise than answer the\ntelephone tomorrow at 9 am. [Definition of\n\u201cnecessary\u201d]\n (8) Therefore, you cannot\ndo otherwise than answer the telephone tomorrow at 9 am. [6, 7]\n (9) If you cannot do\notherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely. [Principle of\nAlternate Possibilities]\n(10) Therefore, when you\nanswer the telephone tomorrow at 9 am, you will not do it freely. [8,\n9]\n\n\nThis argument is formulated in a way that makes its logical form as\nperspicuous as possible, and there is a consensus that this argument\nor something close to it is valid. That is, if the premises are all\ntrue, the conclusion follows. The compatibilist about infallible\nforeknowledge and free will must therefore find a false premise. There\nare four premises that are not straightforward substitutions in\ndefinitions: (1), (2), (5), and (9). All four of these premises have\ncome under attack in the history of discussion of theological\nfatalism. Aristotle\u2019s concern about future contingent truth has\nmotivated an increasing number of compatibilists to challenge premise\n(1). Boethius and Aquinas also denied premise (1), but on the grounds\nthat God and his beliefs are not in time, a solution that has always\nhad some adherents. William of Ockham rejected premise (2), arguing\nthat the necessity of the past does not apply to the entire past, and\nGod\u2019s past beliefs are in the part of the past to which the\nnecessity of the past does not apply. This approach to the problem was\nrevived early in the debate stirred up by Pike\u2019s article, and\nhas probably attracted more attention, in its various incarnations,\nthan any other solution. There are more radical responses to (2) as\nwell. Premise (5) has rarely been disputed and is an analogue of an\naxiom of modal logic, but it may have been denied by Duns Scotus and\nLuis de Molina. Although doubts about premise (9) arose relatively\nlate in the debate, inspired by contemporary discussions of the\nrelation between free will and the ability to do otherwise, the denial\nof (9) is arguably the key to the solution proposed by Augustine. In\naddition to the foregoing compatibilist solutions, there are two\nincompatibilist responses to the problem of theological fatalism. One\nis to deny that God (or any being) has infallible foreknowledge. The\nother is to deny that human beings have free will in the libertarian\nsense of free will. These responses will be discussed in section\n 3.\n The relationship between theological fatalism and logical fatalism\nwill be discussed in section\n 4.\n In section\n 5\n we will consider whether the problem of theological fatalism is just\na theological version of a more general problem in metaphysics that\nisn\u2019t ultimately about God, or even about free will.\n",
