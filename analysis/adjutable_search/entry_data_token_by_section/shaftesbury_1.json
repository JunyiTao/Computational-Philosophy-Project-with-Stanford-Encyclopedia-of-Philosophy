Philosophy\u2019s job is to help us to improve\nourselves\u2014to \u201cregulate our governing Fancys, Passions, and\nHumours\u201d (C 1.283)\u2014so that we can become wiser, more\nvirtuous, and more organized selves. Philosophy is\n\u201cMastership in Life and Manners\u201d\n(C 3.159; see also 3.303). As Rivers\nputs it, philosophy for Shaftesbury is \u201cthe art of learning to\nlive well\u201d (Rivers 2000a: 87; see Klein 1994: 82). Den Uyl says,\nShaftesbury\u2019s \u201cmain purpose [is] to encourage, promote, or\notherwise foster an environment conducive to the exercise of\nvirtue\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 282).\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s belief in the fundamentally\n\u201cself-improving\u201d (C 2.427) purpose of philosophy leads him\nto criticize the turgid, analytic methods of the Scholastics and of\nmodern thinkers such as Descartes and Locke (Schneewind 1998: 307 and\nRivers 2000a: 87). As one of his characters puts it, philosophy must\nbe rescued from its imprisonment in \u201cColleges and Cells\u201d\nwhere it has been immured by \u201cEmpiricks, and pedantick\nSophists\u201d (C 2.184). To achieve its proper goals, philosophy\nneeds to assume guises very different from the dry, unmoving texts of\nShaftesbury\u2019s predecessors.\n\nBecause he thinks that \u201cstraightforward discursive writing could\nhave little chances of successfully promoting virtue in a modern\ncontext,\u201d Shaftesbury presents his own ideas in \u201ca\ndaunting array of formats\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 276). These formats\ninclude: a letter to a friend, a manual for writers, an epistolary\nnovelistic dialogue, a series of \u201crandom\u201d\nreflections delivered without \u201cRegularity and\nOrder\u201d (C 3.8, 3.2), an argumentative inquiry, and a\nwitty essay that eschews \u201cthe Gravity of strict Argument\u201d\nin favor of the \u201cway of Chat\u201d (C 3.97).\n",
