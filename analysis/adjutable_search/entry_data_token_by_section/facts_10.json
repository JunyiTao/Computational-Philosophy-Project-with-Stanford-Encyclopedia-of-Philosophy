    "main_text": "Formal Theories of Facts || .2 Making True\n2.5 The Inner Structure of Facts\n\nThere is, as we have seen, an issue as to whether facts are complex\nentities or not, and as to how (if at all) the various facts are\ncomposed and as to what composition means here. (This question is not\nalways independent of the question whether propositions are complex.\nThis is obvious if facts are taken to be true propositions. But even\nif the identification is rejected, it may nevertheless be maintained\nthat facts share important features with propositions. On\npropositional complexity, see the entries on\n singular propositions\n and\n structured propositions.)\n\nThe view that there is an operation of negation, or conjunction, or\ndisjunction on facts is compatible with the claim that some facts are\ncomplex. For on a natural view, a conjunctive fact is literally\ncomposed by the facts of which it is a conjunction\u2014and similarly\nfor negation and disjunction. (Notice that admitting any two of the\nBoolean operations would then force one to accept that there are\nseveral ways in which the very same facts can combine in order to make\nup a fact.) Acceptance of some Boolean operations on facts is\ncompatible with taking facts to be complex, but it does not entail it:\none may accept, e.g., that a given fact is the conjunction of other\nfacts, and at the same time believe, say, that its depends for its\nidentity on them without having them as parts.\n\nThe issue of the complexity of facts also arises independently of\nissues of Boolean composition. It is a widespread view among the\nfriends of facts that certain facts are complex entities made up of\nobjects and properties or relations, and correspond to certain simple\npredications, at least in the sense that in every world, the\npredication is true if the fact obtains. Call such facts\nsubstantial facts, and that view Substantialism. We\nmay designate the substantial fact that objects \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\)\nstand in relation \\(R\\) (in that order) by \u2018[\\(R\\); \\(a_1 ,\n\\ldots ,a_n\\)]\u2019. According to Substantialism, the sentence\n\u2018Socrates is mortal\u2019 corresponds in the previous sense to\na certain fact composed of Socrates and of the property of being\nmortal, namely [being mortal; Socrates], which obtains in a world only\nif in that world, Socrates exemplify the property of being mortal.\n(There may easily be disagreement about this very example, as indeed\nwith any particular example.) Substantialism is a form of what Fine\ncalls \u2018objectualism\u2019 (Fine 1982). Substantialist views are\nput forward in Russell PLA, Suszko 1968, Van Fraassen 1969,\nTaylor 1985, Armstrong 1997, and perhaps Wittgenstein TLP\n(\u2018perhaps\u2019, because it is not clear which kinds of objects\ncompose facts according to him).\n\nThe existence-conditions of a whole often depend upon facts about its\nparts. If there are disjunctive / conjunctive facts which contain the\ncorresponding disjuncts / conjuncts, then any such fact exists in a\nworld iff some disjuncts / all the conjuncts do. And if there is a\nnegative fact containing the corresponding negated item, the former\nfact exists in a world iff the latter does not. These\nexistence-conditions are written into the nature of the Boolean\noperations.\n\nWhen we come to substantial facts, things are not so straightforward.\nA comparison with sets may be useful. There is a view according to\nwhich the existence of a set requires that of its members: in a world\nwhere, say, Socrates exists but not Plato, the set [Socrates, Plato]\ndoes not exist. And there is the more liberal view which says that\nevery set exists necessarily. Corresponding to these two positions are\nthe following two views about facts:\n\nA substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world (i) the\nobjects have that property and (ii) the objects and the property\nexist;\nA substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world the objects\nhave that property.\n\n\nThe two views are identical if no objects can have a property unless\nthe objects and the property exist. Otherwise they are distinct.\nSuppose there is such a thing as the fact [being human; Socrates].\nBoth views can countenance such an object. But for the first the fact\nwill exist only in worlds where Socrates exists, while for the second\nit is sufficient that Socrates has the property of being human. And it\nmay be held that Socrates has the property in all possible worlds,\neven in those where he fails to exist. (Of course, there is a similar\nissue regarding the existence-conditions of facts across times.)\n\nIt is clear that this divergence potentially has dramatic consequences\nfor one\u2019s conception of the relationships between facts and\npropositions. Take for granted that it is necessary that Socrates is\nhuman, and that Socrates only contingently exists. Then a proponent of\nview (b), but not a proponent of view (a), can claim that the\nproposition that Socrates is human is true in a world iff [being\nhuman; Socrates] exists in that world.\n\nA substantialist may either deny or accept that there is an operation\nof conjunction on facts. If he accepts it, he will presumably view\nconjunctions of substantial facts as themselves complex entities (the\nopposite view would be very odd), doubly complex indeed, having a\nconjunctive structure and the conjuncts in turn having their own\ninternal composition. Similar considerations hold of disjunction and\nnegation.\n\nProponents of (a) are likely to deny that there is an operation of\nnegation on facts. For take the fact [being a philosopher; Socrates],\nand suppose there is a corresponding negation \\(x\\). Then as we saw,\nit would be odd to claim that \\(x\\) is not a complex fact, having\nSocrates as a component. Suppose \\(x\\) has such a complexity. Now take\ntwo worlds \\(w\\) and \\(v\\), such that in \\(w\\) Socrates exists but is\nnot a philosopher, and in \\(v\\), Socrates does not exist (and so is\nnot a philosopher either). Then in both worlds, the proposition that\nSocrates is not a philosopher is true. And according to a proponent of\nview (a), \\(x\\) exists in \\(w\\) but not in \\(v\\). The outcome is\nrather odd. Similar considerations hold of disjunction, but not of\nconjunction.\n\nSo far we have considered two types of complexity facts may have:\nBoolean complexity (which in turn divides into the various types\ncorresponding to the various Boolean operations) and the complexity of\nsubstantial facts. But there are many other types of complexity one\nmay take facts to have. Think of universal facts (the fact that all\nmen have a brain), modal facts (the fact that it is possible that\nSocrates is a football player), and so on.\n\nThe identity-conditions of a whole often depends upon facts about its\nparts. When are two substantial facts \\([R; a, b]\\) and \\([S; c, d]\\)\nidentical? A plausible answer is: when \\(R = S, a = c\\) and \\(b = d\\).\nThis answer has consequences for a friend of Modal Criterion.\nAccepting both the proposed identity-condition and Modal\nCriterion, one cannot claim that there are distinct but\nnecessarily coextensive properties (which are part of some facts), or\nthat the facts [being human; Socrates] and [having a human member;\n[Socrates]] are distinct, even on the plausible assumption that they\nexist in the very same worlds.\n",
