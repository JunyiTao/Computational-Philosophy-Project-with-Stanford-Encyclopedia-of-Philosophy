    "main_text": "\n\nPlato\u2019s shorter ethical works show Socrates at work on topics\nrelated to virtue, which he believes we should seek for the sake of\nthe soul as we should seek health for the body. Works in this group\nshows stylistic as well as philosophic affinities and are generally\nconsidered to have been written early in Plato\u2019s career. The\ndialogues in this group are our main source for the philosophical\nstyle and teaching of the Platonic Socrates, who is thought by some\nscholars to be to a reasonable approximation of the historical figure.\nIn this article, \u201cSocrates\u201d always refers to the Platonic\nfigure in the works under discussion here. He is distinct from the\nSocrates of Plato\u2019s middle works in that he treats the soul as a\nunity, whereas the Socrates of Republic 2\u201310 and other\nmiddle dialogues treats it as divided into two or three parts. \n\nSections 2 through 9 concern philosophical themes that are common to\nthe works under discussion. Section 10 deals with the intellectual\nworld that Plato uses as a backdrop for these dialogues. Sections 11\nto 20 deal with the individual dialogues of the group. The views of\nthis Socrates are hard to make out with certainty because he often\nspeaks in questions, and when he makes statemens they may be strategic\nelements in a refutaion and not his true views. Scholars therefore\nhave been engaged in many controversies about his views. For details\non these, see companion volumes such as Rappe, and Kamtekar (2005),\nMorrison (2011), Bussanich and Smith (2013), and Jones and Smith\n(2023). \n",
