    "main_text": "\n\nMysticism in the Islamic context has traditionally been intertwined\nwith the notion of \u1e24ikmah, which is at once both wisdom\nand philosophy (Nasr 1996). The source of mysticism and the mystical\nelements in Islam are to be traced to the Qur\u2019an and the Islamic\ndoctrine itself. Some of the Qur\u2019anic verses have been viewed by\nthe mystics and philosopher-mystics of Islam as allegorical and\nesoteric hints for those who can see them. \u201cGod is the Outward\nand the Inward\u201d (Qu\u2019ran 57:3), \u201che for whom wisdom\nis given, he truly has received abundant good\u201d (Qu\u2019ran\n2:269), and the famous light verses\n\nGod is the Light of the heavens and the earth, the likeness of His\nlight is as a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp is a glass, the glass\nas it were a glittering star kindled from a blessed tree, an olive\nthat is neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil well-night\nwould shine, even if no fire touched it; light upon lights; God guides\nto His light whom He will. And God strikes similitudes for man, and\nGod has knowledge of everything. (Qu\u2019ran 24:35)\n\n\ncan all be seen as containing esoteric insight. Through out the ages,\nthese verses have inspired a number of Muslim gnostics, some of whom,\nsuch as Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Suhraward\u012b (12th CE)\nand Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 (16th CE) have written\ncommentaries upon them (e.g., Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s\nOn the Hermeneutics of the Light Verse of the Quran).\n\nFrom a mystical perspective, all later developments and interactions\nbetween Islamic philosophy and other intellectual traditions should\ntherefore be seen as rational expressions of the mystical elements\nwithin an Islamic milieu. Mystical elements exist in Islam in two\ndifferent and independent ways. Practically, Sufism represents the\nesoteric dimension of Islam in its purest form, while theoretically\nsalient features of Islamic mysticism were gradually incorporated into\nthe Islamic philosophical tradition. Islamic mysticism, therefore,\nstands on two pillars: first practical, then philosophical. That is,\nesoteric wisdom can either be attained through practical wisdom, which\nincludes inner purification and asceticism, or through a type of\nphilosophy which includes, but is not limited to discursive\nreasoning.\n",
