She\ndelineates three different stages involving attention, each yielding\nobstacles to its realization. First, an agent may fail to notice that\nan effort of attention is called for. As Murdoch says, \u201cI can\nonly choose within the world I can see\u201d (IP: 37/329). What we\nnotice, what registers with us, is an integral part of our fabric of\nmoral being. If an agent fails to see a morally relevant feature of a\nperson nearby (e.g., their distress), this feature will not become\npart of her subjectively perceived world and she will not even attempt\nto focus on this other person as part of an attempt at proffering just\nand loving attention.\n\nBut even if she does notice the morally relevant feature of the other\nand decides to make that attempt, as for example M does with\nrespect to D, she may not be able to do so. Because of\nfantasies and resentments toward the other, or just self-absorption,\nthe moral agent may simply not be capable of focusing on the other\nperson beyond a very superficial level. She may genuinely try, but end\nup with the wrong target occupying her mind.\n\nThird, even if the agent is able to direct her attention to the other\nperson, she may be unsuccessful in making that attention a just and\nloving take on that other person. Try as she might with all sincerity\n(which she is unable to muster at the second stage) her fantasies\nabout that other person, and her fabric of being more generally, may\nkeep her from seeing the other as she really is.\n\nNotice that \u201cattention\u201d is used in two different ways in\nthis account. The first is focusing on another as part of an\nattempt to proffer just and loving attention. (Call this\n\u201cattempt attention\u201d, attention in its mode as an attempt\nat just and loving attention). The second is successfully\nproffering such just and loving attention. (Call this \u201csuccess\nattention\u201d, attention in its mode as a successful attempt.)\n\nOnly if the three hurdles are cleared has the agent achieved the\nsuccess attention that Murdoch thinks morality demands. Various\naspects of the agent\u2019s fabric of ethical being can prevent that\nmoral achievement.\n",
