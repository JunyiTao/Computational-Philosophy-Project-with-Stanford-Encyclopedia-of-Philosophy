    "main_text": "Phenomenology of Life and the Concept of Transcendental Affectivity || Sources of Henry\u2019s Phenomenology\n2.2 Sources of Henry\u2019s Phenomenology\n\nFrom the perspective of the history of philosophy, a critique of\nmonism amounts to a critique of most philosophies, and Henry\nrecognizes only a few precursors as having a presentiment of the\nimmanence pertaining to life as self-appearing. One clear case is\nFrench philosopher Maine de Biran (1766\u20131824), whose work\ninspired Henry\u2019s second book Philosophy and Phenomenology of\nthe Body (1965), explicitly subtitled: Essay in Biranian\nOntology. Through Biran\u2019s \u201csense of effort\u201d,\nHenry connects the theme of the original essence of manifestation to\nthat of the subjective body as locus of immanent affectivity (see\nK\u00fchn 1992). Although it appeared after the Essence of\nManifestation, it is interesting to note that the Biran-book was\noutlined before the Essence and originally planned as a part\nof this more comprehensive work. Considering Biran\u2019s influence on Henry, especially in the light of Henry\u2019s handwritten notes (now available at the Henry-Archive at the University of Louvain-la-Neuve), the phenomenology of life has been conceived of as \u201cphenomenological vitalism\u201d (see Jean 2015). This thesis, however, has not been widely echoed by Henry scholars (for a critique: see K\u00fchn 2019), in part because it relies on notes that Henry himself chose not to publish. \n\nAs for the Essence of Manifestation itself, it finds a\nprecursor concerning the structure of immanence in the works of\nMeister Eckhart and, though to a lesser extent, in the concept of love\nin Fichte\u2019s Die Anweisung zum seligen Leben oder auch die\nReligionslehre (The Way Towards the Blessed Life or The\nDoctrine of Religion) of 1806. Other authors will be interpreted\nin a similar way by Henry: Marx (1976), but also\nSchopenhauer, Nietzsche and Freud in the 1985 Genealogy of\nPsychoanalysis. In the same book, Henry develops an\ninterpretation of Descartes\u2019 Cogito that cannot be overestimated\nin its importance for Henry\u2019s project insofar as it is\nrepeatedly used to introduce Henry\u2019s own concept of the\nphenomenological reduction as \u201ccounter-reduction\u201d, most\nnotably in Section 18 of Incarnation. As for Spinoza, J.-M.\nLongneaux (2004) has defended the thesis of a Spinozism in Henry, who\ndevoted his Master thesis to the concept of happiness in\nSpinoza. However, because Henry almost never again refers to Spinoza\nafter this early work (the subject of which was imposed by his\nthesis-advisor) and will even explicitly distance himself from\nSpinoza\u2019s rationalism, it seems unlikely that Spinoza\nconstitutes an important source for Henry\u2019s phenomenology,\ndespite Longneaux\u2019 arguments. The writings of Husserl and\nHeidegger have played a decisive role in the elaboration of what Henry\ntermed the \u201cphenomenology of life\u201d. but as can be seen\nfrom the critique of intentionality and the emphasis on immanence\nagainst the Heideggerian theme of being-in-the-world, their influence\noperates \u201cby contrast\u201d, which means that Henry will\ndevelop his phenomenology through a series of oppositions to the\nthought of Husserl and Heidegger rather than in accordance with\nthem.\n\nIn the last phase of Henry\u2019s work, however, another source of\nWestern thought came to the foreground, namely Christianity.\nParadoxically, it was before he developed his philosophy of\nChristianity that Henry was targeted (along with Levinas, J.-L. Marion\nand J.-L. Chr\u00e9tien) by D. Janicaud\u2019s critique of what he\npolemically termed the \u201ctheological turn\u201d in French\nphenomenology (Janicaud 1991). Janicaud\u2019s critique is, in fact,\nnot so much directed against an explicit reference to\n\u201ctheology\u201d in phenomenology (which is why the term\n\u201ctheological turn\u201d is polemical and, in a way,\nmisleading), but against an attempt to radicalize phenomenology beyond\nthe scope of object manifestation and intentionality. One can\ntherefore read Janicaud\u2019s essay as advocating in favor of a\n\u201cminimalistic phenomenology\u201d or \u201csurface\nphenomenology\u201d that remains inside such a scope. However, as\nZahavi has pointed out, practically all of the major phenomenological\nthinkers cross such boundaries, especially as they seek to approach\nthe core of subjectivity as well as \u201cthe\nphenomenological question concerning the condition of possibility for\nmanifestation\u201d (Zahavi 1999: 236). One can therefore interpret\nHenry\u2019s explicit \u201cturn\u201d toward a philosophy of\nChristianity as his reaffirmation of the possibility of a radicalized\nphenomenology in which such a philosophy is grounded (see also Capelle\n2004).\n",
