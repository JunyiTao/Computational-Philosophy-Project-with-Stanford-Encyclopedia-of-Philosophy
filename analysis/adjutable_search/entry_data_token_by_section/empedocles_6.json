    "main_text": "Purifications\n3. Purifications\n\nThe title of Empedocles\u2019 hexameter poem, Purifications,\nis not likely to be original; still, the title provides a valuable\nguide to its contents. Purification or cleansing\n(\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2) could be\nperformed both prior to pollution (to ward it off) and after it was\nincurred (to dissolve its power). Ritual and symbolic washing with\nwater or blood were lustral, as was abstinence from select harmful\npractices. Seers held that the purification of the body could remove\ndisease; at the same time, Pythagoreans and Orphic mystics apparently\nunderstood purification as the emancipation of the soul from the body.\nMusaeus and Epimenides also had Purifications attached to\ntheir names. Any one or indeed all of these associations may have\nattracted the title to Empedocles\u2019 work.\n\nApart from the relatively rare explicit citations from the\nPurifications, scholars have been hard pressed to identify\nwhat fragments come from this work as opposed to On Nature,\nand in general adhere to \u201critual\u201d themes as the deciding\nfactor. Additionally, the internal audience appears to be not a single\nindividual as Pausanias, but the people of Acragas in general, and so\nsecond-person plural addresses are often taken as evidence for the\nPurifications. At the start, Empedocles declares his divinity\nand his powers of prophecy and healing to his fellow citizens. In what\nfollows the fragments of the Purifications disclose an\nancient decree and an \u201coracle of Necessity\u201d of\ntransmigration for fallen daemons, \u201cspirits\u201d, as\npunishment for their alliance with Strife through bloodshed and\nperjury (B 115 = D 10 and 11). After becoming polluted, the daemon is\nsuccessively rejected by the elements and banished from the divine for\n30,000 seasons. Empedocles reveals that he too is a participant in\nthis cosmic peripatetic. Incarnation has the potential to expiate the\ncrime of the daemon, and by moving through a series of lives as\nplants, animals, and finally, humans, he returns to the banquets of\nthe gods. But in order to achieve this enlightened state, the daemon\nmust adhere to a rigid ethical program, refusing meat, beans, and the\nbay leaf, and heterosexual sex as well. These injunctions constitute a\nradical indictment of traditional Greek religion.\n\nTransmigration is governed by the four roots under the influence of\nLove and Strife, aligning the Purifications with the physical\ndoctrine of On Nature. Here, however, the ramifications of\nmatter, attraction, and repulsion are paramount for humans. Strife\nsets off the initial collapse of divine unity, creating the daemons\nwho descend into the cycle of incarnations. Their return to the\nworship of Love permits an eventual restoration to the divine.\nEmpedocles gives a vivid portrayal of her peaceful worship by early\nhumans; this near Golden Age is in stark contrast to those fragments\nthat inveigh against traditional sacrifices and the eating of meat in\nlanguage evocative of Agamemnon\u2019s sacrifice of Iphigenia and\nThyestes\u2019 cannibal feast of his children. Worship of Love allows\nfor a return to the divine. At last the daemons arise as gods;\nreleased from exile, they enjoy a blessed life (B 146 and 147 = D 39\nand 40). \n",
