    "main_text": "Political Liberalism: Legitimacy and Stability within a Liberal Society || Reasonable Citizens\n3.2 Reasonable Citizens\n\nReasonable citizens want to live in a society in which they can\ncooperate with their fellow citizens on terms that are acceptable to\nall. They are willing to propose and abide by mutually acceptable\nrules, given the assurance that others will also do so. They will also\nhonor these rules, even when this means sacrificing their own\nparticular interests. Reasonable citizens want, in short, to belong to\na society where political power is legitimately used.\n\nEach reasonable citizen has her own view about God and life, right and\nwrong, good and bad. Each has, that is, what Rawls calls her own\ncomprehensive doctrine. Yet because reasonable citizens are\nreasonable, they are unwilling to impose their own comprehensive\ndoctrines on others who are also willing to search for mutually\nagreeable rules. Though each citizen may believe that she knows the\ntruth about the best way to live, none is willing to force other\nreasonable citizens to live according to her beliefs, even if she\nbelongs to a majority that has the power to enforce those beliefs on\neveryone. After all, Rawls says mentioning the Inquisition, oppressive\nuse of state power will be necessary to unite a society around any\ncomprehensive doctrine, including the comprehensive liberalism of Kant\nor Mill (PL, 37).\n\nOne reason that reasonable citizens are so tolerant, Rawls says, is\nthat they accept a certain explanation for the diversity of worldviews\nin their society. Reasonable citizens accept the burdens of\njudgment. The deepest questions of religion, philosophy, and\nmorality are very difficult to think through. Even conscientious\npeople will answer these questions in different ways, because of their\nparticular life experiences (their upbringing, class, occupation, and\nso on). Reasonable citizens understand that these deep issues are ones\non which people of good will can disagree, and so will be unwilling to\nimpose their own worldviews on those who have reached conclusions\ndifferent than their own.\n",
