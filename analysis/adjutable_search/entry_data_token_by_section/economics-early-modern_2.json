    "main_text": "Pre-Modern Economic Thought\n3. Pre-Modern Economic Thought\n\nAs with many sciences, Aristotle laid much of the groundwork for\neconomic thought, and his legacy, with the medieval scholastics, with\nthe early modern philosophers and last but not least with Karl Marx,\nwas profound and far-reaching (see Meikle 1995). Aristotle\u2019s\nunit of analysis was the oikos, or household, from which the\nword economy is derived, but he also issued important insights on\nmoney and prices, as well as property and slavery. Above all, he\nargued that commercial pursuits were, for the most part, unethical,\nbecause they distorted means and ends. He thus drove a wedge between\nmaterial betterment and the pursuit of virtue. Economic pursuits must\nalways be subsumed to the good life, or sustained happiness\n(eudaimonia). Usury was particularly problematic because it\nviolated the natural order, obtaining a yield from an object, money,\nthat was inanimate (Aristotle Politics 1258b).\n\nAristotle asked one of the most fundamental questions of economics:\nWhat is a price? The simple answer is a ratio of two goods, one of\nwhich might be the established currency, but he maintained that it\nmade no difference; a price in barter is the same as a money price.\nHowever, he qualified this claim with the recognition of the evolution\nof money over time and the fact that many mistake it as an end in\nitself rather than simply a means to facilitate barter. More\nremarkably, Aristotle grasped that a price masks the fact that no two\ncommodities are fully commensurable. Exchange of goods or services, he\nnoted, is grounded in fulfilling specific human needs, and no two of\nthose are ever the same.\n\n\nAlthough [two] things so different cannot become commensurate in\nreality, they can become commensurate enough in relation to our needs\n\u2026 Currency, then by making things commensurate as a measure\ndoes, equalizes them. (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics,\n1131b16-20)\n\n\nHe went further on this path and asserted what is one of the most\nenduring propositions in economics, namely that \u201ceverything must\nhave a price\u201d. (ibid.)\n\nAristotle identified the three functional properties of money that\nremain canonical: money serves as a unit of account (a measure), a\nmedium of exchange (replacing barter), and a store of value (stockpile\nof wealth). Furthermore, he noted that the denomination is purely\nconventional and that legal authorities might alter this at whim.\nMoney was but a yardstick to measure the exchange-value of goods but\nunlike those goods, lacked a use-value as the fable of Midas proved\nall too well. He also asserted that it made no difference what\nsubstance is used for money, but then went on to assert that the\nfetish for gold and silver had made metallic coins unique in human\nsociety. Moreover, precious metals offered certain advantages: they\nare durable, divisible, transportable, and easily stamped with the\nvalue of the coin. Finally, his analysis of monopolistic pricing\ndisplays a firm grasp of the principles of supply and demand.\n\nAquinas, Jean Buridan, and Nicole Oresme, among others of the late\nmedieval period, assimilated Aristotelian economic thought to Biblical\nteachings and, by and large, cast commercial activities in a negative\nlight (Jones 1989; Langholm 1998). To buy low and sell high was to\nengage in deception and hence to violate the Golden Rule. To practice\nusury contravened the Biblical dictum, to \u201clend, expecting\nnothing in return\u201d (Luke 6:35). The late medieval philosophers\ndug more deeply into the evolving legal practices of their time,\ninsofar as wholesale grain merchants, partnerships, and debasements\nhad become increasingly commonplace. Aquinas and Buridan each\naccepted, albeit with qualifications, that money is but a unit of\nmeasure set by men, and thus decreed that the crown might alter the\ndenomination to serve the common good (Kaye 1998; Hirschfeld 2018).\nOresme\u2019s Treatise on Money (1358) went further, acknowledging\nthe problematic shortage of specie and thereby promoting the use of\ncopper or \u201cblack money\u201d, since the coins had turned this\ncolor from overuse. He positioned the currency within the commercial\nsphere and thus broke all the more from the Christian view that the\nestablished coins emanated from God via divine rule, and were thus the\nsole property of the prince (Lapidus 1997).\n\nIn the case of commercial transactions, particularly of necessities,\nthe late scholastics recognized legitimate charges for mercantile\nservices of transportation, storage, and risk-taking, but condemned\nthe practices of price gouging and other types of market\nmanipulations, particularly the forestalling, regrating and engrossing\nof grain supplies. As for singular purchases of land or a luxury item,\nAquinas unpacked in considerable detail the question of whether or not\nit was ethical to sell a good for more than it is worth.\nNotwithstanding customary prices, he recognized numerous circumstances\nwhere this might prove not only legal but also ethical. While berating\nthe Roman maxim of caveat emptor, he endorsed the prevailing\nprinciple of laesio enormis which stipulated that the\ncontracted price could fall within a fifty percent range (plus or\nminus) of the customary price. The doctrine of the \u201cjust\nprice\u201d, one that covered costs but was also sensitive to local\nconditions of demand, was further developed in this period and is\nstill at the core of commercial law. Aquinas also reviewed four\ndifferent contexts that would permit the charging of interest. One\narticulated the concept of an opportunity cost, and another appealed\nto the arrangement of capital transfer known as a partnership still\nhonored today by Islamic authorities. Increasingly, commercial loans\nsaw the principal as a form of capital that had legitimate and\nalternative yields. In sum, the late scholastics offer many insights\non commerce and trade, the status of the Crown in managing legal\ntender, and the inherent tensions between commerce and virtue.\n",
