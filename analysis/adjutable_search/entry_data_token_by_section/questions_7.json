    "main_text": "The semantics of elementary questions || Structured question meanings\n2.4 Structured question meanings\n\nThe theories discussed above all construe question meanings as sets of\npropositions, and are therefore referred to as proposition\nset theories. It has been argued that question meanings as\nconstrued by proposition set theories are all too coarse-grained to\naccount for certain linguistic phenomena. In order to address this\nissue, several theories have been developed that adopt more\nfine-grained, structured notions of question meanings. Such\ntheories have been couched in different semantic frameworks, which are\nall more fine-grained than the standard possible world framework. For\ninstance, the proposal of Krifka (2001) is couched in a structured\nmeanings framework, that of Ginzburg and Sag (2000) in situation\nsemantics, that of Ginzburg (2005), Cooper and Ginzburg (2012) in type\ntheory with records, that of Aloni et al. (2007a) in dynamic\nsemantics, and that of Blutner (2012) in ortho-algebraic semantics. We\nwill illustrate the general approach here by focusing on the proposal\nof Krifka (2001), which in turn has its roots in earlier work of Hull\n(1975), Tichy (1978), Hausser (1978), von Stechow and Zimmermann\n(1984), von Stechow (1991), and Ginzburg (1992).\n\nThe central idea is that question meanings are pairs \\(\\langle\nB,R\\rangle\\), where \\(B\\) is called the background and \\(R\\)\nthe restriction. \\(B\\) is a function that, when applied to\nthe semantic value of an appropriate term answer to the question,\nyields a proposition. \\(R\\) specifies what appropriate term answers\nare, i.e., what the semantic entities are that \\(B\\) can be applied\nto.\n\nFor instance, the meaning assigned to (11a) is\n (11b):[3]\n\n (11)  a.\nWhich student\ncalled?  \n   b.\n\\(\\langle \\lambda\nx.\\lambda w.called(x)(w),\\text{ students}\\rangle\\) \n\n\n\nIn this case, \\(B\\) is a function that maps every individual \\(x\\) to\nthe proposition \\(\\{w: x\\) called in \\(w\\}\\), and \\(R\\) is the set of\nstudents. In the case of a polar question, \\(R\\) is taken to be a set\nconsisting of two functions on propositions, the identity function and\nthe function that maps every proposition to its complement, which are\nassumed to be expressed by yes and no, respectively.\nFor instance:\n\n (12)  a.\nDid Mary call?\n \n   b.\n\\(\\langle \\lambda\nf.f(\\lambda w.called(m)(w)),\\{\\lambda p.p,\\lambda p.\\neg\np\\}\\rangle\\)  \n\n\nFrom a structured question meaning it is always possible to obtain the\ncorresponding proposition set meaning, by applying \\(B\\) to all the\nelements of \\(R\\) (and taking the downward closure of the resulting\nset of propositions in case we want an inquisitive question meaning in\nthe sense of \\(\\Inq_B\\). It is not possible to go in the other\ndirection, which means that structured question meanings have strictly\nmore expressive power than proposition set meanings (e.g., von Stechow\n1991, Krifka 2001). \n\nThis additional expressive power is needed to account for certain\nphenomena. For instance, the questions in (13) and (14) have exactly\nthe same set of exhaustive/resolving answers, which means that they\nreceive exactly the same semantic value in any of the proposition set\naccounts discussed above.\n\n(13)Is the door open?\nYes. / No.\n(14)Is the door open or\nclosed? *Yes. / *No.\n\n\nYet, the two questions differ in that the first licenses answer\nparticles like \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 while the second\ndoesn\u2019t. In a structured-meanings approach, the two questions\nare semantically distinguishable. This additional semantic\nfine-grainedness forms the basis for an account of polarity particle\nresponses.\n\nNote that some of the extended implementations of inquisitive\nsemantics (e.g., Roelofsen and Farkas 2015) are also fine-grained\nenough to account for answer particles. As mentioned above, in these\nimplementations the meaning of a question does not only capture what\nis needed to resolve the issue that the question raises, but also\nwhich propositions are made available by the question for subsequent\nanaphoric reference, for instance by answer particles. In effect,\ncapturing anaphoric potential also adds structure to question\nmeanings. Thus, these implementations maintain a proposition set\nperspective, but at the same time address the need for richer semantic\nstructures as well. Such a synthesis is also achieved in Aloni et\nal. (2007a).\n",
