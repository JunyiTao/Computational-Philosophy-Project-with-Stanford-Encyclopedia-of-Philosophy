Introduction\n\n\nIn the introduction to ha-Emunah ha-Ramah (henceforth:\nER) Abraham Ibn Daud states that he decided to write his book\nin order to solve the problem of free will. Scripture fails to provide\nan unequivocal answer to this problem, since biblical verses on this\nissue seem to contradict one another. Ibn Daud is convinced that\nphilosophy can help to distinguish between the verses that should be\nunderstood literally and those that are in need of interpretation. In\nhis view, the problem in his day is that those who have begun to study\nphilosophy are unable to keep the lamps of philosophy and religion\nburning simultaneously \u201cfor if the lamp of philosophy is\nkindled, the lamp of religion goes out\u201d (ER W 2; S\n 3b-4b).[1]\n This is why certain people believe that it is better to steer well\nclear of the study of philosophy. The consequence thereof is that many\nJews are at a loss when it comes to solving religious problems, such\nas the problem of free will. According to Ibn Daud, this is because\nthey fail to investigate the principles of religion with the help of\nphilosophy and to search for the harmony between the two modes of\nknowledge. His book intends to remedy this situation by showing\nbeginning students of philosophy how to establish such harmony.\n\n\nIbn Daud thus reveals himself to be a staunch advocate of the study\nof philosophy and the use of reason to achieve the correct\ninterpretation of problematical biblical passages. In his view, the\nfact that man is endowed with reason obliges him to use his\nintellect. Throughout his treatise, he strives to demonstrate how\nreason and Scripture are not at variance with each other and that\n\u201ctrue philosophy\u201d is contained in Scripture.\n2. Biography\n\n\nThe exact date of Ibn Daud\u2019s birth is unknown. It is commonly\nassumed that he was born c. 1110 in one of the major centers of Muslim\nSpain, perhaps Cordoba. He himself asserts that he received his\neducation from his maternal uncle, an uncle who is known to have been\nactive as both a teacher and a communal leader in Cordoba, where he\ndied in 1126. Although no further data are available, it is evident\nfrom his works that this education must have been a combination of\n\u201cGreek wisdom\u201d and traditional Jewish learning. Greek\nwisdom in the cultural setting of Andalusia refers to the study of\nclassical science and philosophy as taught by Muslim scholars and\nphilosophers. Indeed, his writings testify to a thorough familiarity\nwith Greek philosophy and science as read by the Muslim philosophers\nal-Farabi and Ibn Sina, as well as with rabbinic literature, Hebrew\npoetry, and Jewish philosophy. He also appears to have had some\nknowledge of the New Testament and Christian and Muslim polemical\nliterature. Later in life, Ibn Daud moved to Toledo, presumably as a\nresult of the Almohad invasion of Andalusia (1147), an event that led\nmany Jews to flee from Southern Spain. In any event it is in Toledo\nthat he wrote his two major works in defense of Judaism (circa\n1160/61): the philosophical treatise ER and the historical\nSefer ha-Qabbalah (cf. below section 3). Ibn Daud is reported\nto have died a martyr\u2019s death in Toledo c. 1180. The earliest\nreference to this was made by the Toledan philosophic author Judah ben\nSolomon ha-Kohen in his encyclopedia Midrash ha-Hokhmah (first\nhalf of the 13th century).\n\n\nSince 1954 scholars of Jewish and Latin philosophy have been intrigued\nby M.T. d\u2019Alverny\u2019s suggestion that Abraham Ibn Daud is the same\nperson as the twelfth-century Arabic-into-Latin translator Avendauth,\nalso known as \u201cAvendeuth philosophus israelita\u201d, who\ncollaborated with Dominicus Gundissalinus in Toledo. Though appealing,\nno indisputable proof could be provided for this\nidentification. Recent research on the Toledan Arabic-into-Latin\ntranslation program, however, has provided strong support in favor of\nd\u2019Alverny\u2019s identity-suggestion. The new studies portray Avendauth as\nthe motive force (Bertolacci 2011:54) behind the Latin translations of\nIbn Sina.(D\u2019Alverny 1954; Bertolacci\n2011; Burnett 2009; Fidora 2011; Hasse 2006; Schwartz 2013;Freudenthal 2016).\n3. Major Works\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s two major works are Sefer ha-Qabbalah (The\nBook of Tradition) and Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah. Both books were\nwritten around the same time (c. 1160). They are closely related in\nthe sense that they endeavor to defend rabbinic Judaism; the former\nwith the help of history and the latter with the help of\nphilosophy.  The purpose of Sefer ha-Emunah ha-Ramah was to prove\nthe truth of the words of the prophets by philosophical means, while\nSefer ha-Qabbalah and related historical works were intended to\nconfirm the validity of the prophecies by demonstrating the\nreliability of their transmission from one generation to the next\n\n\n\nIn Sefer ha-Qabbalah, which has become a classic in Hebrew\nliterature, Abraham ibn Daud provides a survey of Jewish and general\nhistory and attempts to demonstrate the continuity of rabbinic\nJudaism.  According to G.D.Cohen this work also conveys an esoteric\nmessage of messianic redemption in the near future, a thesis that was\nchallenged by E. Krakowski (2007) as well as by K. Vehlow, who\nrecently edited the two chronicles appended to Sefer\nha-Qabbalah: one on the history of the kings of Israel during the\nSecond Temple period, and the other on the history of Rome, which are\nsimilarly polemical in nature (2013). The chronicles had a wide impact\non Protestant authors from the 16th century onwards.\n\n\nHis philosophical book was written in Arabic and entitled\nal-\u2018Aq\u00eedah al-raf\u00ee\u2018ah (The Exalted\nFaith). The Arabic original is no longer extant. Towards the end of\nthe fourteenth century, the work was translated into Hebrew twice: the\nfirst time under the title Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah by Solomon ben\nLavi (c. 1370?), possibly at the instigation of the philosopher Hasdai\nCrescas, and a second time under the title Ha-Emunah\nNissa\u2019ah by Samuel ibn Motot. This second translation is\nbased on the first, but is less accurate (Eran 1996). Of this version\nonly one copy is extant, whereas of Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah 16\nmanuscripts are known (some of them are not complete). \n\n\nIbn Daud is also reported to have written a book on astronomy, the\ncontents of which are unknown. The same applies to an anti-Karaite\npolemical work, which he mentions himself. Moreover, K. Szil\u00e1gyi has\ndiscovered a fragment of an otherwise unknown work by Ibn Daud on\nPhysics in Arabic. \n\n\nIn the introduction to ER, Ibn Daud mentions two earlier\nJewish philosophers: Saadya (often described as the first Jewish\nphilosopher, first half of the 10th century, Baghdad) and\nthe philosopher-poet Solomon ibn Gabirol (11th century,\nSpain). However, he dismisses their writings claiming that they are\ninadequate with respect to his goal, namely the study of philosophy in\norder to examine the principles of religion. This statement reflects\nIbn Daud\u2019s awareness of introducing a new trend to Jewish\nphilosophy. Saadya\u2019s Sefer ha-Emunot we-ha-De\u2018ot (Book\nof Opinions and Beliefs) provides a rationalistic interpretation of\nJudaism, but is influenced by the thought of the Muslim\nkal\u00e2m-theologians, which was considered outdated in Ibn Daud\u2019s\nday, whereas Ibn Gabirol\u2019s Meqor Hayyim (known in Latin as\nFons Vitae) is a neo-Platonist work, which makes no\nreference at all to Jewish sources.  Indeed, Ibn Daud\u2019s book\nconstitutes a novelty in that it is the first attempt to\nsystematically introduce the Aristotelianism of the Muslim\nphilosophers Alfarabi (870\u2013950) and Ibn Sina (980\u20131037) into Jewish\nphilosophy. His philosophical terminology and syllogistic reasoning\nare derived from the works of these authors. His\n\u201ctechnical\u201d approach has led Husik to observe that\n\u201cIbn Daud leaves upon us the impression of a precise thinker,\ncold and analytical. He exhibits no grace of style, eloquence of\ndiction or depths of enthusiasm and emotion\u201d (Husik 2002:\n198). This judgment of his style may be too harsh.  Undoubtedly his\nbook must have made some demands on it readers, but it is only fair to\nnote that Ibn Daud attempts to liven up the monotony of his logical\narguments at regular intervals by using analogies and quotes from\npoems.\n4. Structure and Sources of ER\n4.1 Structure\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s book consists of an introduction and three parts of unequal\nlength. In the introduction, Ibn Daud states that the problem of free\nwill, which prompted him to write his book, can only be solved after\nthe preparatory philosophical study of a variety of issues in the\nfield of physics and metaphysics. In what may be called a \u201ctable\nof contents\u201d, he specifies the various topics to be discussed in\nhis book in his introduction; topics with which the beginning student\nmust become familiar. The first part (Weil 1852, 4\u201343) deals\nwith the basic principles of (Aristotelian) physics and\nmetaphysics. It opens with a logical section that treats substance and\nthe categories (I.1). This is followed by discussions on matter, form\nand the elements (I.2), motion and infinity (I.3\u20135), the soul (I.6\u20137)\nand the heavenly spheres (I.8).  According to Ibn Daud, this\nconstitutes the minimum requirements for an investigation of the\nJewish religion. The \u201cprinciples of religion\u201d provide the\nsubject matter for the second part (Weil 1852, 44\u201398). Here Ibn\nDaud is concerned with God\u2019s existence and unity (II.1\u20132), divine\nattributes (II.3), cosmology and the heavenly intelligences (II.4),\nprophecy and the defense of Mosaic Law (II.5), and, finally, angelology and the\nproblem of free will (II.6). The third and final part (Weil 1852,\n98\u2013104), deals with ethics. In this work, Ibn Daud thus offers a\ncomprehensive survey of the contemporary philosophical debate. Due to\nthe variety of topics covered, the book has been characterized as a\ncompendium or a \u201cphilosophical encyclopedia in miniature\u201d\n(Arfa 1954, 2).\n\n\nIn accordance with Ibn Daud\u2019s concern for the harmony between\nrevelation and reason, biblical exegesis occupies a prominent place in\nthe ER. Up to the section on prophecy (II.5), the discussion\nof each and every philosophical topic is followed by a section in which\nIbn Daud provides biblical verses that are intended to point to or\ndemonstrate the truths of the philosophical teachings in the preceding\nphilosophical account. In this way Ibn Daud endeavors step by step to\nprove that \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d does not contradict\nrevelation. From the chapter on prophecy onwards, however, biblical\npassages are not provided in a separate section, but are instead\ninterwoven into the philosophical discussion; indeed they lie at the\nheart of it.\n4.2 Sources\n\n\nThe \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d that Ibn Daud expounds is the form\nof Aristotelianism, which was articulated by the Muslim philosophers\nAlfarabi and especially Ibn Sina. Ibn Daud refers to Alfarabi\u2019s\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Topics and seems to have been\nfamiliar with his commentary on the Categories as well. In\ngeneral, Ibn Daud was influenced by Alfarabi\u2019s thought as\npresented in as-Siy\u00e2s\u00e2t\nal-madaniyya (The Political Regime). Even more important for Ibn\nDaud\u2019s system was Ibn Sina\u2019s thought. Many of the\ndemonstrations in the ER are based on works by this author,\nin particular his encyclopedic works Kit\u00e2b\nal-Shif\u00e2\u2019 and Kit\u00e2b\nan-Naj\u00e2t. Most influential was Ibn Sina\u2019s psychology,\nas well as his views of the Necessary Being, cosmology and the origin of\nevil.  Ibn Daud also drew on the work of the critic of these\nphilosophers, al-Ghazali (1058-1111) who summarized their teachings in\nMaq\u00e2sid al-Fal\u00e2sifa (The Intentions of the\nPhilosophers). It is most probable that Ibn Daud\u2019s book reflects\nal-Najat in its purpose, organization, and language.  Another source\nof inspiration was the Muslim theologian and polemist Ibn Hazm, whose\nanti-Jewish polemic inspired Ibn Daud\u2019s Biblical exegesis. As\nfor his Jewish predecessors, Ibn Daud built on\nSaadya\u2019s Emunot and was certainly familiar with Judah\nHalevi, although he does not explicitly mention him by name\n(cf. section 5.7 below).  Occasionally, one also comes across views\nthat he shares with Bahya ibn Paquda, Ibn Zaddiq, or Abraham ibn\nEzra.\n5. Main Themes in ER\n5.1 Substance, Accident, and Natural Philosophy\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s Aristotelian orientation is immediately evident in\nhis analysis of the notions of substance and accident, with which his\nbook opens. Everything that is, is either substance or accident.\nCriticizing the neo-Platonic approach of Solomon ibn Gabirol, who held\nthat substance and accident are relative terms, so that the selfsame\nthing can be a substance in one respect and an accident in another, he\ninsists that substance and accident are absolute terms and that a thing\nis either a substance or an accident, but not both. The fact that\ncertain substances derive their existence from a cause, and that they\ncan be ordered hierarchically, does not detract from their\nsubstantiality: ontologically all substances are alike. This initial\ninquiry into the ontological constitution of existing things and the\ncorrect understanding of \u201csubstance\u201d as that which\nconstitutes the essence of a thing (and is thus more worthy of the term\n\u201cbeing\u201d than is accident) is crucial to Ibn Daud. Besides\nforming the point of departure for a systematic discussion of various\nkinds of substances, corporeal and incorporeal, it allows him to prove\nthat the soul is a substance, not an accident. Moreover, the\ndistinction between corporeal and incorporeal substances introduces the\nreader to the existence of celestial intelligences; the incorporeal\nsimple substances that play a central role in his thought.\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s discussion of substance and accidents includes a\nsurvey of the Aristotelian categories, which is largely based on the\naccounts of the Muslim philosophers. After this initial exposition, the\ncategories are not given much further attention in the rest of the\nbook. For our purposes, however, it is important to note that this\noverview of the categories is the first systematic presentation of the\nsubject or, for that matter, of any other logical work by Aristotle, in\nJewish philosophy.\n\n\nThe introduction on substance and accident leads Ibn Daud to a\ndiscussion of the question of the sense in which form and matter, the\ntwo constituents of physical beings, are substances, which allows Ibn\nDaud to introduce the notions of potentiality and actuality. He then\nproceeds to deal with other basic principles of Aristotelian\nphilosophy, such as motion and infinity. I will not go into detail\nhere, since Ibn Daud\u2019s exposition does not actually provide any\nimportant new insights. Instead his aim is to introduce the beginning\nstudent to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics. However, it is worth\nnoting that, while earlier Jewish philosophers, such as Ibn Zaddiq,\nhad dealt with substance and accident and other such principles, Ibn\nDaud is the first to do so coherently and comprehensively from an\nAristotelian viewpoint. His proofs for the theses that every motion\nrequires a mover and that the existence of an infinite series in\nactuality is impossible are two cases in point. The same can be said\nof his expositions on the soul.\n5.2 Soul\n\n\nThe soul is an important and central issue in the ER, related\nas it is to Ibn Daud\u2019s treatment of the aforementioned\nkey-concepts of Aristotelian natural philosophy on the one hand, and\nto his discussions of cosmology, prophecy and ethics on the\nother. About one fifth of the book is devoted to an investigation of\nthe soul, its nature and faculties, its relation to the body and its\nafterlife (ER W 20\u201341; S 54b\u2013116b). Ibn Daud infers the\nexistence of something like the soul from the fact that different\nnatural bodies are characterized by various actions, which can only be\nexplained by positing the existence of an immaterial principle that is\nadded to their corporeality and from which these actions derive.\nFollowing Aristotle, Ibn Daud defines the soul as the perfection of a\nnatural organic body that possesses life potentially. Elaborating on\nthe distinction between soul and accident, he maintains that the soul\nis a substance (in the sense of form), refuting the view of the\n\u201cphysicians\u201d that it is a mixture, thereby dismissing all\nother theories according to which the soul is an accident. In\ncontradistinction to earlier Jewish philosophers of neo-Platonic\norientation, Ibn Daud emphasizes the unity of the soul.\n\n\nA key idea in Ibn Daud\u2019s detailed description of the various\nfunctions of the vegetative, animal and rational faculties is the\nnotion that there is a hierarchy of soul-faculties, in which the lower\nones serve the higher. The speculative faculty of the human soul\noccupies the highest position in this hierarchy. Thanks to this\nfaculty, which is directed towards the incorporeal world, man can\nperfect his knowledge and apprehend the incorporeal beings that are\ncalled angels in Scripture. It thus constitutes the link between man,\nangels and God. This faculty is served by the practical faculty, which\nis directed to the corporeal world, and governs man\u2019s conduct.\nAlthough the soul is dependent on the body during the first stages of\nthe acquisition of knowledge when the intellect passes from\npotentiality to actuality, it can exist separate from the body when it\nhas attained the stage of acquired intellect. The rational soul is,\ntherefore, immortal. According to Ibn Daud,\n\n \u2026 the ultimate purpose of the creation of bodies in the\nphysical world was that from the world of generation and corruption\nimmaterial immortal substances would be purified. Such a substance is\nthe human soul that is perfected by true knowledge and correct action\n(ER W 23\u201324; S 65b\u201366b).\n \n\n\nThe importance of Ibn Daud\u2019s psychology does not lie so much in its\ncontents (that are largely based on Ibn Sina\u2019s psychology), but\nprimarily in its detailed treatment and in the manner in which he\nemploys and adapts Ibn Sina\u2019s theories so as to accommodate his own\npurposes.  The premise that the human soul is an incorporeal\nsubstance is the key to the philosophers\u2019 promise that internalizing\nthe intellectual and eternal truths will grant eternal life. The\nquestion of immortality is a sophisticated conversion of a theological\nproblem into a philosophical argument regarding the eternity of truth\nand spiritual pleasures. It is based on Ibn Sina\u2019s discourse on this\nissue, and in many cases quotes him word for word.\n5.3 God and Divine Attributes\n\n\nIbn Daud deviates significantly from his predecessors since he does\nnot deduce the existence of God from creation. In fact, as we shall\nlater see, Ibn Daud has little to say on the issue of creation.\nInstead, his two proofs are based on Aristotle\u2019s theory of\nmotion, which presents a novelty in medieval Jewish thought. The first\nproof makes use of two theses that were proven in the sections on\nmotion and infinity respectively: firstly, there is no motion without a\nmover, and secondly, the existence of an infinite series in actuality\nis impossible. On the basis of these premises, Ibn Daud establishes the\nexistence of a first unmoved mover. Unlike Aristotle, however, he does\nnot base the incorporeality and infinity of this first mover on the\neternity of motion; an Aristotelian doctrine that he prefers to leave\nunmentioned. The second proof is based on the distinction between\nnecessary and possible (or contingent) existents. The latter class of\nexistents derives their existence from a cause. Since an infinite\nregress of causes is impossible, the series of contingent beings must\nend with the existence of an uncaused being who is called the Necessary\nBeing and whose essence suffices for its existence. Evidently Ibn Daud\nconsidered the second to be a better proof than the first given that it\nyields a first principle of being, instead of merely a first principle\nof motion. The contrast with earlier Jewish philosophers also comes to\nthe fore in Ibn Daud\u2019s designations of God, such as \u201cthe\nfirst unmoved mover\u201d, \u201cthe necessary being\u201d or\n\u201cthe first cause\u201d rather than \u201cthe Creator\u201d.\nThese appellations are wholly in line with his stated aim of guiding\nthe reader to a philosophical conception of God. However, at the same\ntime, it is evident that he identifies this first principle with the\nGod of the Bible, an equation for which he does not provide any\narguments.\n\n\nThis God is absolutely one, both in the sense of unique (God is\nexternally one) and in the sense of simple (God is internally one,or uncomposed).\nGod\u2019s unity implies that he cannot have essential or accidental\nattributes since that would imply plurality in the divine\nessence. Therefore, the attributes that are often ascribed to God,\nsuch as that he is one, existent, true, mighty etc. etc. should be\ninterpreted either negatively, or as relations. According to Ibn Daud,\n\u201cthe truest predicates or attributes of God are the negations\n[\u2026] and although they remove many doubts, they do not convey\nanything\u201d (ER W 51.9\u201312; S 131b15\u2013131b3). To remedy\nthis, Ibn Daud interprets the negations as negations of something,\nnamely of similarity, that is, as expressions of incomparability. For\nexample, with regard to the predication of unity to God, he argues\nthat since among all essences nothing can be found that is like God,\n\u201cwe know His unity in such a way that we know that His unity is\nnot like that of any other thing that is called\n\u2018one\u2019\u201d (ER W 52.25\u201327; S 133b1\u20133). As for\nattributes understood as relations, Ibn Daud explains:\n\n Like someone can be described, for example, in that he is the son of\na certain man, and the father of a second and the uncle of a third, the\nmaternal uncle of a fourth, the friend of a fifth and the enemy of a\nsixth [\u2026] this [kind of predication] is not impossible. Indeed\nmultiple relations do not imply multiplicity in the essence of what is\ndescribed by them. And in this way we can describe the Creator with\nmany attributes since they are relations between Him and the other\nexistents (ER W 54.29\u201335; S 136b8\u201314).\n \n5.4 Cosmogony and Intelligences\n\n\nTo explain how the plurality of the sub-lunar world can proceed from\nthis absolutely one God, Ibn Daud presents the theory of\n\u201cintermediaries\u201d, as he found it in the works of the Muslim\nphilosophers. This theory holds that there are secondary substances\n(or: heavenly intelligences) that serve as intermediaries between God\nand the lower world. His first step is to prove the existence of the\nActive Intellect, the lowest in the series of heavenly intelligences.\nHis proof is based on the premise that the human intellect passes from\npotentiality into actuality, which can only be due to an agent that\npossesses the end of motion (that is, knowledge) in actuality. Ibn Daud\nthen proceeds to prove the existence of other incorporeal substances,\nfor which he likewise bases himself on the Aristotelian theory of\nmotion, an approach that is new to Jewish philosophy. Taking the\ncircularity of the motions of the heavenly bodies as a point of\ndeparture, he argues that the souls of the spheres in their motions\npass from potentiality into actuality just as the human soul does. This\nmotion must be caused by the intellects of the spheres that are objects\nof desire for their souls. The existence of heavenly incorporeal\nsubstances thus having been established, Ibn Daud goes on to describe\nhow the lower proceeds from the higher, according to \u201cthe\nphilosophers\u201d. In their view, a first intelligence emanates from\nthe One, which is similarly incorporeal, but not simple, as it has a\ncause, which involves composition in this entity. In a three-fold act\nof cognition, this intelligence produces a triad of heavenly intellect,\nsphere-soul and heavenly body, and this process is repeated until the\nsphere of the moon to which the active intellect belongs. From the\nvarious motions of the spheres, matter and forms emanate on the\nsub-lunar world. The details of this process are not pertinent to our\ncurrent purposes. It is more relevant to note that Ibn Daud criticizes\nthe emanation-theory of the philosophers by claiming that there are no\ndemonstrative proofs for it. In his view, they invented their theory to\nsolve the problem of how many can come forth from one, yet, at the same\ntime, it seems to raise more questions than it actually solves. As he\nputs it: \u201cThey escaped from one defamation but fell into\nothers\u201d (ER W 67; S 159b).\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s own position, however, is far from clear. There is\nno doubt that he accepts the notion of a hierarchical causal chain of\nheavenly souls and intelligences that have an influence on the heavenly\nworld. However, he leaves his reader in the dark as to how they proceed\nfrom God, claiming that the human intellect is too limited to grasp\nthis and that the philosophers err when they assume that the intellect\ncan know everything. More generally, he does never address the issue of (eternal)\nemanation versus creation. Although he equates the God of the\nphilosophers with the Biblical Creator, he offers no arguments in\nfavour of creation. All that we hear is that \u201cgrand\nthings\u201d, such as the Ten Commandments, come directly from God.\nHowever, he fails to explain how this should be reconciled with the\ntheory of emanation, according to which only one thing proceeds from\nGod directly and other things indirectly. Likewise, Ibn Daud tells us\nin one passage that matter does not proceed from God directly; whereas\nin another he bluntly states that matter is God\u2019s creation\nwithout offering any argumentation for this last statement.\n\n\nIbn Daud identifies the intelligences, which are also referred to as\nelevated, simple, separate or incorporeal substances, with the angels\nin Scripture that are intermediaries between God and man. Indeed, it is\nprecisely their function as secondary causes that turn them into an\nindispensable element in his thought. Firstly, he uses the angels to\navoid the unworthy notion that God should occupy himself with the\nparticulars of the terrestrial world, which would imply plurality in\ndivine knowledge. According to Ibn Daud, the angels are entrusted with\nthis task. Secondly, Ibn Daud needs the notion that the angels are\nintermediaries for the interpretation of certain biblical texts that\nseem to imply a change of will in God, which is tantamount to plurality\nin his essence. His solution is that such verses refer not to God, but\nto various classes of intermediaries instead. By this interpretation,\nwhich is the outcome of philosophical reasoning, Ibn Daud also sought to\ncounter the charges of anthropomorphism that were made by the Muslim\ntheologian Ibn Hazm.\n5.5 Prophecy\n\n\nProphecy is another important issue in Ibn Daud\u2019s thought, as it\nis the prophet who is the link between the heavenly world and man.  He\nis the person who\u2014thanks to his specific knowledge\u2014must\nguide man towards intellectual and moral perfection. Ibn Daud\u2019s\naccount of prophecy immediately follows his discussion of the\nintelligences, since it is the Active Intellect that plays a crucial\nrole in the explanation of prophecy. This account has a twofold aim:\nfirstly, to provide a rational explanation of the phenomenon of\nprophecy and, secondly, to defend the eternal validity of Mosaic Law\nagainst Christian and Muslim claims to the contrary. Ibn Daud is,\nhowever, not entirely consistent with regard to the first\nobjective. He begins his exposition by following the Muslim\nphilosophers in arguing that prophecy is a natural process that is\nrelated to dreams. Basing himself on his psychology, he explains how\nin certain circumstances someone can receive the overflow of the\nActive Intellect on his imaginative faculty and intellect by which he\nbecomes a prophet. This goal can be pursued by people with a pure soul\nthrough study and association with good people. It would thus seem\nthat anybody who meets certain requirements will automatically become\na prophet. However, in a manner reminiscent of Judah Halevi, Ibn Daud\nthen adds that the occurrence of this phenomenon is bound to certain\nconditions of place, time and nation. Clearly these stipulations are\nan attempt to safeguard the special character of biblical prophecy,\nbut at the same time they impinge on the universalistic character of\nhis psychological explanation of prophecy.\n\n\nThe defense of the eternal validity of Mosaic Law is directed\nagainst Christians, whose major claim was that the Law of Moses was\nreplaced by the New Testament, as well as against Muslims, who believed\nthat the Law received by Moses was falsified throughout the course of\ntime. We do not need review his polemics here or his use of Islamic\ntheological arguments that prove that Moses is the only prophet who meets\nthe requirements of classifying as a \u201ctrue prophet\u201d. What\nis of interest for our purpose is that Ibn Daud structures his\narguments in a syllogistic framework, so as to adapt this polemical\nchapter to the overall philosophical outlook of the rest of the\nwork.\n\n\nAs to the place of this chapter in Ibn Daud\u2019s book, Amira Eran\nhas suggested that the chapter on prophecy originally formed an\nindependent unit, which was later integrated into the ER\n(Eran 1998: 263ff.).\n5.6 Free Will\n\n\nThe topics that have been discussed thus far are all considered by Ibn\nDaud to be necessary steps towards the solution of the problem of the\nfreedom of the human will. Towards the end of the book, he finally\naddresses the issue within the context of a cluster of related\nproblems, such as God\u2019s knowledge, the nature of evil, causality\nand providence. Ibn Daud\u2019s theory of physical evil is to a large\nextent based on Ibn Sina\u2019s approach. It is impossible that God\nshould be the agent of evil. The evil that is found in nature is due\nto matter. In fact, it is a privation, just as darkness is the\nprivation of light. As such it is not-being and cannot be brought\nabout by an agent. Moreover, what an individual considers to be evil\ncan be a benefit for mankind as a whole. In line with Ibn Daud\u2019s\nconception of man as a microcosm, evil in man is likewise to be\nascribed to his matter and to the absence of knowledge. However, man\nis able to free himself from matter by means of knowledge, that is, by\nthe actualization of his potential intellect with the help of the\nintelligences so as to be able to discriminate between good and evil.\nAnother remedy for the resistance of evil lies in the Torah.\nMan\u2019s choice to fight his evil inclination is neither necessary,\nnor impossible, but possible. To explain this, Ibn Daud states that\nGod provided certain created things with possibility. However, the\n\u201cpossible\u201d can be divided into two kinds, the first being\nthe \u201cpossible\u201d that is due to ignorance, for example that\nthe people of Spain do not know whether the king of Babylon died today\nor whether he is alive. To them the matter is possible because of\ntheir ignorance of what happens far away whereas in itself the matter\nis not possible: one of the alternatives must necessarily be true\n(ER W 96.11\u201316; S 205b11\u201314). With respect to the second kind\nof the \u201cpossible\u201d Ibn Daud says that it is\n\u201cpossible\u201d\n\n because God made it as \u201cpossible\u201d and created it as\nsomething that admits of two contrary attributes, either this or that,\njust as it happened to be\u2014as regards this [kind of possible]\none cannot deny that God knows it as possible. And if someone would\nobject by saying \u201cdoes God not know the end of the\nmatter?\u201d we reply that this is not ignorance (ER W\n96.21\u201325; S 206a5\u20139).\n \n\n\nMoreover, Ibn Daud makes use of a fourfold division of causes that\nhe found in Halevi (Kuzari V.20): besides necessary causes that God knows as\nnecessary, there are natural and incidental causes that are entrusted\nto secondary causes. The fourth category consists of free causes or\n\u201ccauses due to choice\u201d, thanks to which man is free to\nchoose between good and evil. In other words, God has no foreknowledge\nas regards human action. This rather drastic conclusion is quite\nunusual in Jewish philosophy; prior to Ibn Daud no Jewish philosopher\nwas prepared to limit God\u2019s knowledge to save the notion of free\nwill. In Ibn Daud\u2019s view, however, this position does not involve\nignorance in God.\n\n\nOnce man has made a choice with respect to moral conduct, the angels\nassist him in carrying out his choice. Moreover, the providence\nexercised by the angels is commensurate with man\u2019s own efforts.\nIn this way, the biblical verses that seem to convey that human action\nis determined by God are to be explained: the \u201chardening\u201d\nof Pharaoh\u2019s heart (Ex. 7:3) means that the intelligences helped him to\npersist in carrying out his own bad choices.\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s approach to the question of free will is not\nwithout serious difficulties. Firstly, his conception of evil as\nprivation and as associated with matter conflicts with his initial\nconception of matter as a substance. Secondly, on the one hand, Ibn\nDaud argues that it is the intellect that chooses between good and\nevil, yet he also claims that the choice is a matter of man\u2019s\nheart, without explaining how these two notions relate. Finally, he has\nnothing to say on the possibility of \u201crepentance\u201d, which\nseems to imply that man is determined as it were by his own first\nchoice.\n\n\nUnsatisfactory as Ibn Daud\u2019s solution may be, he has\nnonetheless succeeded in removing the contradiction between biblical\nverses on the issue and thus in establishing harmony between philosophy\nand religion. It was important for him to demonstrate this harmony with\nrespect to all the topics that led up to the question under\nconsideration, but it is essential with respect to free will, because\nhere philosophical speculation and religious practice intertwine. For\nIbn Daud, there is no point in leading a religious life when man is not\nfree to choose. This issue of free will therefore marks the transition\nfrom philosophical speculation to practical philosophy, which is the\nsubject of the last part of ER.\n5.7 Ethics and Religious Practice\n\n\nIbn Daud has developed a philosophic conception of God who is\nabsolutely one and acts through intermediaries. From this God only good\ncan proceed, whereas evil is to be attributed to matter and to\nman\u2019s own bad choices. Once it has been established that man\nindeed has free choice with regard to moral conduct and that evil does\nnot come from God, there is no impediment for man to opt for the good\nlife. In his practical philosophy Ibn Daud expounds his view of the\nbest life. His point of departure is a description of the ethics of the\nphilosophers, which is a combination of Platonic psychology with\ncorresponding virtues to the concupiscent, vital and rational soul and\nthe Aristotelian conception of virtue as the proper mean between two\nextremes, a model that he borrows from Muslim philosophers.\n\n\nHe deviates, however, from the Platonic scheme by positing justice\ninstead of wisdom as the supreme cardinal virtue. Wisdom appears as\nthe virtue belonging to the theoretical intellect, but thanks to\njustice, which in Ibn Daud\u2019s interpretation is a mean that gives\neverything its due, man is able to attain bliss. Man can attain bliss,\nthe highest goal to which practical philosophy leads us, through moral\nperfection, which consists in perfecting his character, and in leading\na good family and social life. Justice is the highest virtue for it\neffects harmony between the various faculties of the soul in the\nindividual and forms the basis for man\u2019s social life. Not only is it a\nphilosophical virtue, but it is also a divine commandment, as can be\nderived from Micah 6:8. Justice indeed appears to be a key-notion in\nIbn Daud\u2019s ethics, for it also provides the basis for man\u2019s relation\nwith God, and thus, the rationale for fulfilling the commandments of\nthe Torah. Ibn Daud\u2019s reasoning is as follows: once it has been\nestablished that only good proceeds from God, it is a matter of\njustice that man requites his benefactor by serving God. The choice to\nserve God is consequent upon true knowledge of God, for such knowledge\nautomatically produces love in man, and love in turn requires action,\nthat is, divine worship which is achieved by accepting the\ncommandments of the Torah.\n\n\nLove and knowledge thus appear to be interrelated for one cannot\nlove what one does not know. Intellectual love of God has fear of God,\nin the sense of awe, as a corollary and automatically leads man to\ndivine worship. The Torah is the most perfect guide for leading a good\nmoral and religious life, for it contains commandments that help man to\nconstantly direct his actions towards God, as well as commandments that\nteach moral and social virtues. Moreover, it includes the so-called\nrevelational commandments that call for obedience. Even though no\nrational explanation can be found for them, man must accept them once\nreason has established that they belong to a true revelation, which has\nbeen brought by a true and morally perfect prophet.\n\n\nThis emphasis on religious practice in the last part of ER\nis consistent with Ibn Daud\u2019s statement in his introduction that\nthe goal of study is practical philosophy (ER W 4. S 8b).\nWhile the bulk of the book is concerned with philosophical speculation,\nby the end of it practical philosophy comes to occupy center stage.\nThis shift from philosophical speculation to religious praxis gains\nextra significance against the background of Judah Halevi\u2019s\nattack on the philosophical worldview in Kuzari I.1. According\nto Halevi, for the philosophers the highest good is conjunction with\nthe Active Intellect. Once man has attained this degree, it does not\nmatter which religion or which kind of divine worship he adopts.\nAlthough Ibn Daud does not mention Halevi by name, it is clear that he\nwas familiar with and used his work. In fact, his work can be seen as a\ndirect response to Halevi. Whereas Halevi regards philosophy as a\nthreat to religion, for Ibn Daud it is indispensable for it, since the\nstudy of philosophy induces man to accept religious commandments,\nincluding those whose rationale is obscure. Therefore, despite the\nextensive theoretical discussions, ER as a whole can be seen\nas a work of practical philosophy. Moreover, one may argue that the book is a\ndefense of philosophy as much as it is a defense of religion.\n6. The Reception of Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah\n\n\nIf Ibn Daud can be regarded as the pioneer of medieval Jewish\nAristotelianism, the question arises whether Maimonides, who, through\nhis Guide and his prestige turned it into the dominant\ncurrent in medieval Jewish rationalism, was familiar with the thought\nof his predecessor. Husik goes as far as to state: \u201cwe feel\ntempted to say that if not for Ibn Daud there would have been no\nMaimonides\u201d (Husik 2002: 198). However, Maimonides makes no\nexplicit mention of Ibn Daud in any of his works. Yet he seems to\nallude to him in Guide I.71, when he refers to one of the\nearlier Jewish Andalusian thinkers whose doctrine is approximately the\nsame as that of his own book, a description that fits Ibn Daud far\nbetter than any other of Maimonides\u2019 Jewish predecessors. In spite of\nthe absence of a specific mention of Ibn Daud, it is highly probable\nthat Maimonides was familiar with Ibn Daud\u2019s work, as the large number\nof similarities between the two works\n suggests.[2]\n To a large extent, these points of overlap are due to their\nauthors\u2019 common use of theories from Islamic sources, such as\nthe demonstrations for the existence of God.  Other parallels,\nhowever, cannot be attributed to these sources, such as parallels in\nBiblical exegesis, in particular verses that relate to the doctrine of\nangels, their interpretation of the term elohim and of the\nterms tselem and demut in Gen.\n 1:26.[3]\n\n\nOther shared characteristics concern the general framework and the\nintended audience: both works seek to guide Jews who are confused in\ntheir traditional belief as a result of the study of philosophy.\nMoreover, in some passages, Maimonides seems to implicitly criticize\nor correct Ibn Daud, for example, in his doctrine of attributes where\nMaimonides explicitly rejects the view that attributes that are\nunderstood as relations can be ascribed to God (cf. section 5.3\nabove).  Maimonides says that at first sight this kind of predication\nmay seem permissible, but more exact speculation proves that it is\nincorrect, since there is no true relation between God and what is\nother than God (Guide I.52, transl. Pines p. 120).  In\ngeneral, one is tempted to assume that Ibn Daud\u2019s work served as\na model for Maimonides from which he drew inspiration on the one hand\nand which he found to be in need of improvement on the other. \n\n\nRecent research suggests that Ibn Daud\u2019s thought has had more impact\non post-Maimonidian medieval Jewish philosophy than was previously\nassumed. M. Zonta has argued that the renewed interest in ER in\nthe second half of the fourteenth century, as evidenced by the\nproduction of two Hebrew translations, had to do with the emergence of\na \u2018Jewish Avicennism\u2019 during that period (Zonta\n2002). Marginal glosses in several manuscripts of ER reveal\nthat the text was actually studied, perhaps even by a group of\nstudents. Hasdai Crescas mentions Ibn Daud together with Ibn Sina and\nal-Ghazali as an important pre-Maimonidean author (Or ha-Shem,\nIntroduction to Book I). Crescas\u2019s student Josef Albo seems to have\ndrawn on Ibn Daud\u2019s views (Ehrlich 2010). Y. Essudri has established\nthat also R. Ephraim al-Naqawah of Tlemcen (first half of the 15th\ncentury) quoted from ER, whereas a late 15th century manuscript\ncontains a commentary on it that was perhaps intended for\nteaching-purposes.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nAbraham ibn Daud\u2019s importance lies in the fact that he was the\nfirst to present a coherent systematic interpretation of Judaism\nin light of the new challenge, namely Muslim Aristotelianism. The\nsustained use of Aristotelian doctrines and logical reasoning clearly\ndistinguishes ER from the writings of earlier Jewish\nphilosophers. Moreover, the manner in which he incorporates his Muslim\n(and to a lesser extent) Jewish sources in a carefully structured\nsystem in order to solve a religious problem is noteworthy. His thought\ndevelops along the following lines: substance\u2014form \u2013\nmotion and transition from potentiality into actuality\u2014soul\n\u2013 God\u2014intelligences\u2014prophet\u2014freedom of\nthe will\u2014correspondence between correct knowledge and correct\nconduct\u2014perfection.\n\n\nNonetheless, it should be noted that Ibn Daud\u2019s thought\ncontains a number of \u201cloose ends\u201d; the promised harmony\nbetween religion and philosophy is certainly not always achieved. Cases\nin point are his ambiguous position with regard to the origin and\nstatus of matter and the way in which he skirts around the issue of\ncreation versus emanation. The inconsistencies and undetermined issues\nin ER are partly the result of the influence of neo-Platonism.\nThe Aristotelianism of the Muslim peripatetics still contains an\nappreciable number of neo-Platonic notions that have made an impact on\nIbn Daud. Arfa\u2019s evaluation of Ibn Daud\u2019s philosophic\nactivity \u201cat the point where it has rejected neo-Platonism but\nhas not yet freed itself of many of its fundamental doctrines and\nthought habits, and on the other hand has espoused Aristotelianism but\nhas not yet assimilated the full meaning of its world outlook\u201d\nhits the nail right on the head (Arfa 1954: 4).\nFor another part, the flaws in Ibn Daud\u2019s thought are due to his\nconception of philosophical knowledge as the foundation on which\nreligion should be built. For all the importance he attaches to the use\nof philosophical speculation, his bias is religious, which is why he\nprefers to remain vague about or to omit Aristotelian doctrines like\nthe eternity of motion. When harmony between religion and philosophy\nseems to be impossible, Ibn Daud shrinks from accepting the\nconsequences of Aristotle\u2019s doctrines and instead chooses to seek\nrefuge in the limitations of the human intellect, claiming that the\nphilosophers tend to overreach themselves. The weaknesses in his\nthought notwithstanding, Ibn Daud\u2019s significance for the\ndevelopment of Jewish philosophy can hardly be underestimated.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLitEdiTra\">A.
