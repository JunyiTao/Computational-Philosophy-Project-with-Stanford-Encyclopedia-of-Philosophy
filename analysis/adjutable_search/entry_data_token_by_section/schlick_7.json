    "main_text": "The Protocol Sentence Controversy\n8. The Protocol Sentence Controversy\n\nThe celebrated \u2018protocol sentence controversy\u2019 in the\nVienna Circle was initiated by Carnap\u2019s syntactic analysis of\nobservation sentences, or \u2018protocols\u2019 (Carnap 1932a). The\nsalient feature of Carnap\u2019s analysis was its\n\u2018syntacticism\u2019, the idea that meaning is wholly a function\nof the serial arrangements of symbols. Naturally, syntacticism\nprecludes any effort to explain protocols by their relation to\n\u2018experiences\u2019, \u2018sensory impressions\u2019, or\n\u2018observations\u2019. Otto Neurath criticized Carnap\u2019s\nanalysis, arguing that protocols should be understood\nphysicalistically, as sentences of the physical language, and their\norigins and grounds are to be explicated naturalistically, by means of\nbehaviorist psychology (Uebel 2007, Ch. 8). But Schlick recoiled at\nthe very idea that the relation between observation sentences and what\nthey describe should be explicated by any means other than\nphilosophical analysis. So, in his classic 1934 essay, \u201cOn the\nFoundations of Knowledge,\u201d he introduced so-called\n\u2018affirmations\u2019 (Konstatierungen) in the effort to\nexplicate the relation between physicalistic protocols and the\nexperiences on which they are grounded (Schlick 1979b, 370\u2013387).\nOtto Neurath responded, in his 1934 essay \u201cRadical Physicalism\nand the \u2018Real World\u2019\u201d, condemning Schlick\u2019s\nview as just so much metaphysics, while Carnap regarded affirmations\nas protocols of a phenomenal language, along the lines of one of the\nalternatives he had outlined in his 1932 paper, \u201cOn Protocol\nSentences\u201d (Neurath 1983, 66; Carnap 1932b, 458\u2013463). Still,\nCarnap objected that, unless Schlick could explain how affirmations\nmight be translated into sentences of the physical language, then\naffirmations violated the thesis of physicalism. Schlick responded\nthat affirmations, like \u201cHere now white\u201d, were the\nresponses of investigators when asked about their personal experiences\nin experimental situations. Thus construed, the demonstrative\ncharacter of affirmations ensures their incorrigibility (Schlick 2009,\n661\u2013674). Although their demonstrative character prevents them\nfrom being regarded as proper physicalistic sentences, they are\nobviously translatable into statements of the physical language. But\nthen, even though they lose their distinctive epistemic character, for\nthey are no longer incorrigible or indubitable, they still convey\nepistemic warrant to their physicalistic translations. \n\n\nTo Carnap, the deeper problem was that, by the lights of his 1934 work\non The Logical Syntax of Language, affirmations are not\nwell-formed expressions at all. Earlier, in his (1932a) contribution\nto the protocol sentence controversy, Carnap\u2019s treatment of\nobservation was based on the Thesis of Metalogic, the idea that all\nphilosophical contentions (which are not nonsense) are metalinguistic\nclaims about linguistic expressions and their logical (particularly\nsyntactical) properties (Carnap 1932a, 435n). The function of the\nMetalogic Thesis was to isolate pseudo-theses or statements which seem\nto concern substantive matters but are really concerned with logical\nor linguistic matters. Of course, these pseudo-theses became known as\n\u2018pseudo-object sentences\u2019 and their analysis became a\ncenterpiece of Carnap\u2019s Logical Syntax-era philosophy (Carnap\n1937, Sec. 74). And the Metalogic Thesis, together with the Principle\nof Tolerance (which asserts that the choice of any specific language\nis a conventional decision), formed the principal theses of Carnap\u2019s\nphilosophy of logic in the Thirties (Carnap 1937, 51\u20132). Otto\nNeurath, who endorsed the Metalogic Thesis and the Tolerance\nPrinciple, drew the obvious conclusion that Schlick\u2019s defense of the\ncorrespondence conception of truth, explicated by his analysis of\naffirmations, committed him to the recognition of \u201cthe one, true\nreality\u201d and \u201cthe real world\u201d (Neurath 1983,\npp. 106\u20138; Uebel 2007, Sec. 8.2). In short, Schlick\u2019s\nfoundations were spelled out in nothing more than philosophical\npseudo-statements.\n\n\nWhat Neurath and (presumably) Carnap both missed was that\nSchlick\u2019s thinking about meaning and linguistic significance had\ncome a long way since his 1926 essay on \u201cExperience, Cognition,\nand Metaphysics\u201d, in which he tried to link Wittgenstein\u2019s\nremarks about internal relations in the Tractatus with his own\ndoctrine of implicit definition (Wittgenstein 1921, 4.122, 4.125,\n4.1251, 5.232). There the goal was to apply both these ideas to the\ndistinction between intuitions and concepts. The result was\nsomething of a disaster. For it implied what Schlick called\n\u201cThe Incommunicability of Contents\u201d, the idea that any\neffort to communicate non-formal contents, like the greenness of the\ncolor green or the distinctive smell of wood smoke, must forever remain\nineffable (Oberdan 1996, Sec. 2). But it was not long before\nSchlick\u2019s efforts to explain linguistic meaning and scientific\nknowledge in terms of their \u2018form\u2019 and\n\u2018content\u2019 were abandoned and by the 1934\u20131935 academic\nyear, he was developing what might well be called \u2018a semantic\nconception\u2019, spelled out in terms of grammars and the rules which\nconstitute them, and presenting his new vision of language in his\nlectures on \u201cLogik und Erkenntnistheorie\u201d\n(Schlick 1934\u20135).\n",
