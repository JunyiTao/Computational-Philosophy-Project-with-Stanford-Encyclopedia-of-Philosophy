    "main_text": "Augustine || Warfare\n4.2 Warfare\n\nAugustine insists, against the Manichees, that the God of the Old\nTestament is the same God as the God of the New Testament. One of the\nmost striking differences between the two testaments was in relation\nto warfare. In the Old Testament God permits, in fact requires, the\nIsraelites to engage in massacres. In the land God has given to the\nIsraelites, the inhabitants of a city that surrenders will be\nenslaved, but if the city resists, \u201cyou shall not leave a single\nsoul alive\u201d\n (Deuteronomy 20:11, 16).\n \u201cYou must utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with\nthem, and show no mercy to them\u201d\n (Deuteronomy 7:2).\n If in some Israelite city some inhabitants practice idolatry,\n\u201cyou shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword,\ndestroying it utterly, all who are in it and its cattle\u201d\n (Deuteronomy 13:16).\n Moses himself carried out a massacre of Israelites who had practiced\nidolatry\n (Exodus 32:25\u20139).\n Moses was angry when the Israelites spared women and children, and\nordered them to kill all the prisoners except the virgins, whom they\ncould keep for themselves\n (Numbers 31:13\u201318).\n Samuel was angry with Saul when the army let some animals live; for\nthat sin, God deprived Saul of the kingdom\n (1 Samuel 15).\n Samuel himself hewed a prisoner to pieces\n (1 Kings 15:32\u20133).\n In the New Testament, in contrast, Christ says: \u201cif one strike\nthee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other\u201d\n (Matthew 5:39).\n Can the New Testament be reconciled with the Old Testament? On\nAugustine\u2019s view, the two Testaments must be reconcilable, since\neverything in the Bible is true.\n\nAccording to Augustine, God may treat his creatures as he pleases, and\nthe Israelites accordingly did no wrong in carrying out God\u2019s\ncommands. (As medieval authors often put it, God is \u201clord of\nlife and death\u201d.) On the other hand, the New Testament\u2019s\napparently pacifist injunctions relate to inner attitude, rather than\nto outward act. \n\n\nThese precepts pertain rather to the inward disposition of the heart\nthan to the actions which are done in the sight of men, requiring us,\nin the inmost heart, to cherish patience along with benevolence, but\nin outward action to do what seems most likely to benefit those whose\ngood we ought to seek. ([412]\n Letter 138.2.13)[14]\n\n\n\nThose whose good we ought to seek include ourselves, and also our\nenemies, and coercion and punishment may benefit them, so we may war\nagainst them for their own good, as well as for our own. Private\nindividuals may not make war, but rulers, including Christians, may do\nso, and Christian soldiers may serve in such wars in obedience to a\nruler, even a pagan. Augustine emphasizes that both rulers and those\nwho do military service in obedience to rulers must avoid hatred,\ngreed and other dispositions incompatible with love. Although\nscattered across different texts, thanks in part to the success of the\nDecretum, Augustine offered later writers a Christianised\nversion of the Roman theory of the just\n war.[15]\n\n",
