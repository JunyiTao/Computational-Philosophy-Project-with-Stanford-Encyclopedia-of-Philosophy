    "main_text": "Governance\n6. Governance\n\nThroughout the Song-Ming period, mastery of Confucian texts was\nrequired for the civil service exams and thus for most appointments to\nstate office. Confucianism had also long enjoyed a special prestige\namong bureaucrats and state officials, being seen by many as offering\nthe best training for the skills and ethical demands of governance.\nAccordingly, many of the major Confucian philosophers and their\ninterlocutors had experience with and were keenly interested in\nadministration and state affairs. Most Confucians conceived of their\nobligations to the state as pulling in two directions: they saw\nloyalty to the hereditary monarchy as mandatory in most major\nrespects, but they also regarded it as their duty to share the benefit\nof their ethical guidance and sound judgment with the emperor and\nauthorities at every level. On one relatively prevalent understanding\nof that role, to both serve the emperor and provide him with ethical\nmoorings was the highest form of loyalty, for it helped to sustain the\nrule and further consolidate its legitimacy as a successor regime to\nthe Confucian sage-kings of old. At times, however, many Song-Ming\nConfucians lost confidence in the emperor and his court and sought to\npromote more decentralized forms of government with local and\nnon-state institutions taking on a larger role (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 181\u2013189).\n",
