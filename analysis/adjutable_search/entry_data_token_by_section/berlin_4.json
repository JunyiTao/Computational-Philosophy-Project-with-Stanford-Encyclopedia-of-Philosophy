    "main_text": "Philosophy of Knowledge and the Humanities || The Distinction between the Sciences and the Humanities\n2.3 The Distinction between the Sciences and the Humanities\n\nBerlin\u2019s individualism, the influence on him of neo-Kantianism,\nand what one scholar (Allen 1998) has called his anti-Procrusteanism\n\u2013 his opposition to attempts dogmatically and inappropriately to\nimpose standards or models on aspects of human experience which they\ndon\u2019t fit \u2013 shaped his view of what he usually referred to\nas the \u2018humanities\u2019 (sometimes as \u2018humane\nstudies\u2019) and their relationship to the (natural) sciences. By\n\u2018humanities\u2019 he meant all disciplines concerned with the\nstudy of human conduct and experience \u2013 thus encompassing many\nso-called \u2018social sciences\u2019 as well as the fields of study\ntraditionally classed as \u2018humanities\u2019 (see note 1).\n\nBerlin criticised the positivist view of the sciences as the\nparadigmatic form of knowledge, which the humanities should measure\nthemselves by and seek to emulate. He argued that the humanities\ndiffered fundamentally from the sciences both in the nature of their\nsubject matter (as Vico and Dilthey had maintained), and in the sort\nof knowledge that they sought (as Rickert insisted). As a result,\ndifferent methods, standards and goals were appropriate to each.\n\nMost obviously, the humanities study the world that human beings\ncreate for themselves and inhabit, while the sciences study the\nphysical world of nature. Why should this make a difference to the way\nthey are studied? One answer is that the two worlds are fundamentally\ndifferent in themselves. But Berlin preferred the argument that the\nhuman and natural worlds must be studied differently because of the\ndiffering relationship between the observer or thinker and the object\nof study. We study nature from without, culture from within. In the\nhumanities the scholar\u2019s own ways of thinking, the fabric of his\nor her life, every facet of his or her experience is part of the\nobject of study. The sciences, on the other hand, aim to understand\nnature objectively and dispassionately. The scientist must take as\nlittle for granted as possible, preferring hard evidence to\n\u2018common sense\u2019 when they diverge. But in the humanities\none cannot act in this manner: to study human life, it is necessary to\nbegin from our understanding of other human beings, of what it is to\nhave motives and feelings. Such understanding is based on our own\nexperience, which in turn necessarily involves certain\n\u2018common-sense\u2019 assumptions, which we use to fit our\nexperience into patterns that make it explicable and comprehensible.\nThese patterns may be more or less accurate; and we can judge their\naccuracy by seeing how well they fit experience as we know it. But we\ncannot divest ourselves entirely of the assumptions that underlie\nthem. (The human world can also itself be a legitimate subject of\nscientific study, of course, but only incompletely, by bracketing off\nwhat makes it distinctive. Cf. note 7.)\n\nBerlin asserted that the humanities also differed from the sciences in\nthat the former were concerned with understanding the particulars of\nhuman life in and of themselves, while the sciences sought to\nestablish general laws which could explain whole classes of phenomena.\nThe sciences are concerned with types, the humanities with\nindividuals. Scientists concentrate on similarities and look for\nregularities; at least some practitioners of the humanities \u2013\nhistorians, in particular \u2013 are interested in differences. To be\na good historian requires a \u2018concentrated interest in particular\nevents or persons or situations as such, and not as instances of a\ngeneralisation\u2019 (1978b, 180). The humanities should not aim to\nemulate the sciences by seeking laws to explain or predict human\nactions, but should concern themselves with understanding every\nparticular human phenomenon in its uniqueness. In the case of a\nscience we think it more rational to put our trust in general laws\nthan in specific phenomena; in the case of the humanities, the\nopposite is true. If someone claims to have witnessed a phenomenon\nthat contradicts well-established laws of science, we seek an\nexplanation that will reconcile that perception with science; if none\nis possible, we may conclude that the witness is deceived. In the case\nof history we do not usually do this: we look at particular phenomena\nand seek to explain them in\n themselves.[6]\n There are, Berlin claimed, \u2018more ways than one to defy\nreality\u2019. It is unscientific to \u2018defy, for no good logical\nor empirical reason, established hypotheses and laws\u2019. But it is\nunhistorical, on the other hand, to \u2018ignore or twist one\u2019s\nview of particular events, persons, predicaments in the name of laws,\ntheories, principles derived from other fields, logical, ethical,\nmetaphysical, scientific, which the nature of the medium renders\ninapplicable\u2019 (1978b, 185).\n\nBerlin emphasised the importance to a sense of history of the idea of\nits \u2018one-directional\u2019 flow (ibid., 144). This sense of\nhistorical reality makes it seem not merely inaccurate, but\nimplausible, and indeed ridiculous, to suggest, for example, that\nHamlet was written in the court of Genghis Khan (ibid., 142,\n175). The historical sense involves, not knowledge of what happened\n\u2013 this is acquired by empirical means \u2013 but a sense of\nwhat is plausible and implausible, coherent and incoherent, in\naccounting for human action (1978b, 183). There is no a priori\nshortcut to such knowledge. Historical thinking is much more like the\noperation of common sense, involving the weaving together of various\nlogically independent concepts and propositions, and bringing them to\nbear on a particular situation as best we can, than like the\napplication of laws or formulae. The ability to do this is a knack\n\u2013 judgement, or a sense of reality (1978b, 152).\n\nUnderstanding of history is based on knowledge of humanity, which is\nderived from direct experience, consisting not merely of\nintrospection, but of interaction with others. This is the basis for\nVerstehen, or imaginative understanding: the\n\u2018recognition of a given piece of behaviour as being part and\nparcel of a pattern of activity which we can follow, [\u2026] and\nwhich we describe in terms of the general laws which cannot possibly\nall be rendered explicit (still less organised into a system), but\nwithout which the texture of normal human life \u2013 social or\npersonal \u2013 is not conceivable\u2019 (1978b, 168). The challenge\nof history is the need for the individual to go beyond his or her own\nexperience, which is the basis of his or her ability to conceive of\nhuman behaviour. We must reconstruct the past not only in terms of our\nown concepts and categories, but in terms of how past events must have\nlooked to those who participated in them. The practice of history thus\nrequires gaining knowledge of what consciousness was like for other\npersons, in situations other than our own, through an\n\u2018imaginative projection of ourselves into the past\u2019 in\norder to \u2018capture concepts and categories that differ from those\nof the investigator by means of concepts and categories that cannot\nbut be his own. [\u2026] Without a capacity for empathy and\nimagination beyond any required by a physicist, there is no vision of\neither past or present, neither of others nor of ourselves\u2019\n(1978b, 177\u20138). Historical reconstruction and explanation\ninvolves \u2018entering into\u2019 the motives, principles, thoughts\nand feelings of others; it is based on a capacity for knowing like\nthat of knowing someone\u2019s character or face (1978b,\n173\u20135).\n",
