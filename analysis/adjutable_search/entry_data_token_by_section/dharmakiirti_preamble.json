    "main_text": "\n\nThe life of Dharmak\u012brti, a profound and rigorous philosopher of\nIndian Buddhism, is a subject of hagiography with little solid data\nupon which we can confidently\n rely.[1]\n If we go by Tibetan sources, he seems to have been born in South\nIndia and then to have moved to the great monastic university of\nN\u0101land\u0101 (in present day Bihar state) where he was supposedly\nin contact with other Buddhist luminaries, such as Dharmap\u0101la\n(530\u2013561 C.E.). Tibetan sources describe his life in very\ncolorful terms. Indeed some make him out as initially a\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka who then broke with that non-Buddhist\nschool; others depict him as extraordinarily skilled in debate and\nhint at a difficult and arrogant personality. Judging by the opening\nverses in his most famous (and by far his longest) work, the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika (Commentary on\nEpistemology), Dharmak\u012brti himself thought that his\nphilosophy would not be understood by his contemporaries because of\ntheir small-minded vanity. At the end of the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, he went further and\nprophesied that his work of unrivalled depth would never receive its\nproper recognition, but would age in obscurity locked away in\n itself.[2]\n\nHe was wrong about that, fortunately for us. His philosophy certainly\ndid find recognition, at least it did in many parts of Asia. He, and\nhis predecessor Dign\u0101ga (c. 480\u2013c. 540 C.E.), were\nresponsible for a school of Buddhist thought that actually had no name\nin Sanskrit, although in Tibetan it was known as \u201cthose who\nfollow reasoning\u201d (rigs pa rjes su \u2018brang ba); in\nmodern literature it is sometimes known by the convenient Sanskrit\nmisnomer pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da, or more simply,\n\u201cthe Epistemological School.\u201d In any case, it is the\nBuddhist school that provoked the most sophisticated and most\nimportant philosophical debates with non-Buddhist rivals. It\nrepresented Buddhism in the pan-Indian debates on problems of\nuniversals, philosophies of logic and language, and issues of\njustification, and had an enormous influence on Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism in Central Asia, especially in Tibet. Finally, although its\ninfluence was relatively limited in medieval China (only a few of the\nworks of Dign\u0101ga were translated into Chinese, none of the works\nof Dharmak\u012brti were translated), it has nonetheless become\nincreasingly important in modern Japan in supplying the epistemology\nfor Buddhist thought.\n\nIt is still debated in the modern community of researchers on\nDharmak\u012brti whether one should place this philosopher in the\nseventh century C.E. or in the sixth. Part of the reason for this\nindecision is that a significant time seems to have elapsed before\nDharmak\u012brti achieved notoriety in India, although it is unclear\nhow much. Erich Frauwallner came out strongly for 600\u2013660 C.E.\nas Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s dates, using an argumentum ex silentio\nthat is short of conclusive\u2014hardly more than one piece in the\n puzzle.[3]\n One problem is that there may indeed be some counterevidence that\nwould place Dharmak\u012brti a half-century earlier, inter\nalia his possible connections with Dharmap\u0101la, a\nsixth-century idealist philosopher who, according to Tibetan\nhistorians, was the monk that ordained Dharmak\u012brti. Some have\nthought that there is even a reference to Dharmak\u012brti in\nDharmap\u0101la\u2019s commentary to Dign\u0101ga\u2019s\n\u0100lambanapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 (\u201cAnalysis of the\nobject [of perception]\u201d). However, because this commentary is\nonly available to us at this time in Chinese in an unreliable\ntranslation by Yijing, it is not clear that the passage in question\ndoes in fact refer to Dharmak\u012brti. Caution or even agnosticism on\nthe matter of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s dates still seems to be warranted,\nalthough the scales are tipping towards an earlier date. Krasser\n(2012) relies heavily on connections between Dharmak\u012brti,\nBh\u0101viveka and Kum\u0101rila to push the dates of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s activity back to the mid sixth century C.E.\n [4]\n Balcerowicz (2016) argues that Dharmak\u012brti directly influenced\nthe Jaina writer Samantabhadra. He proposes 530-590 as the dates for\nthe latter and 550-610 as the dates for Dharmak\u012brti.\n\nLeaving aside the question of dates, Frauwallner (1954) did most\nlikely pin down the order in which Dharmak\u012brti composed five of\nhis seven works, namely, and in this order, the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika,\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya (\u201cAscertainment of\nEpistemology\u201d), Ny\u0101yabindu (\u201cDrop of\nReasoning\u201d), Hetubindu (\u201cDrop of Logical\nReasons\u201d), and V\u0101dany\u0101ya (\u201cLogic of\nArgumentation\u201d). The two minor works, the\nSambandhapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 (\u201cAnalysis of\nRelations\u201d) and Sa\u1e43t\u0101n\u0101ntarasiddhi\n(\u201cProof of Other Minds\u201d), are more difficult to place in\nthe sequence. There is also an autocommentary to the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti. However, the\nhypothesis of Frauwallner that there was a proto-text that later\nbecame the Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti is\nstill speculative.\n\nIn what follows, most of our discussion will center around the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, as it is by far the largest\nand most important of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s works. It is an unfinished,\nhighly philosophical, commentary on the\nPram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya (\u201cCompendium of\nEpistemology\u201d) of Dign\u0101ga. At various key places in the\ntext we see that Dharmak\u012brti seems to have formulated some basic\nideas as a reaction to now lost commentaries by Dign\u0101ga\u2019s\nstudents, the most important being the commentary on the\nPram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya by \u012a\u015bvarasena. A\nnotable reaction to \u012a\u015bvarasena is Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nemphasis on certainty (ni\u015bcaya) (see sections\n 1.4\n and\n 3.1).\n There are also innovations that, as far as we know, were not provoked\nby earlier commentators. Whether in metaphysics, epistemology or\nphilosophy of language, causal theories carry considerable\nphilosophical weight. These theories are probably to quite a degree\noriginal, not found in Dign\u0101ga\u2019s own writings. In what follows,\nwe will examine what we consider to be the most salient features of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy, bringing out inter alia the\nimportance of this causal stance. It is however impossible to discuss\nall the major themes that were traditionally commented upon by\nBuddhist scholastic writers on Dharmak\u012brti. Choices and\nexclusions had to be made. For readers who seek a comprehensive\ntreatment of the historical development of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\npositions in his seven works, the best reference to date is\nEltschinger (2010). Quite detailed summaries of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nworks are found in Potter (2017).\n",
