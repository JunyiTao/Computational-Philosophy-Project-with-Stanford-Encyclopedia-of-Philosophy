The Context and Background of Boole\u2019s Work In Logic\n\n\nTo understand how Boole developed his\nalgebra of logic, it is useful to review the broad\noutlines of the work on the foundations of algebra that had been\nundertaken by mathematicians affiliated with Cambridge University in\nthe 1800s prior to the beginning of Boole\u2019s mathematical publishing\ncareer. An excellent reference for further reading connected to this\nsection is the annotated sourcebook From Kant to Hilbert,\n1996, by William Ewald, which contains a complete copy of Boole\u2019s\nMathematical Analysis of Logic.\n\n\n\nThe 19th century opened in England with mathematics in the doldrums.\nThe English mathematicians had feuded with the continental\nmathematicians over the issues of priority in the development of the\ncalculus, resulting in the English following Newton\u2019s notation, and\nthose on the continent following that of Leibniz. One of the obstacles\nto overcome in updating English mathematics was the fact that the great\ndevelopments of algebra and analysis had been built on dubious\nfoundations, and there were English mathematicians who were quite vocal\nabout these shortcomings. In ordinary algebra, it was the use of\nnegative numbers and imaginary numbers that caused concern. \n\n\n\nThe first major attempt among the English to clear up the foundation\nproblems of algebra was the Treatise on Algebra, 1830, by\nGeorge Peacock (1791\u20131858). A second edition appeared as two\nvolumes, 1842/1845. He divided the subject into two parts, the first\npart being arithmetical algebra, the algebra of the positive\nnumbers (which did not permit operations like subtraction in cases\nwhere the answer would not be a positive number). The second part was\nsymbolical algebra, which was governed not by a specific\ninterpretation, as was the case for arithmetical algebra, but solely\nby laws. In symbolical algebra there were no restrictions on using\nsubtraction, etc.\n\n\nPeacock believed that in order for symbolical algebra to be a useful\nsubject its laws had to be closely related to those of arithmetical\nalgebra. In this connection he introduced his principle of the\npermanence of equivalent forms, a principle connecting results in\narithmetical algebra to those in symbolical algebra. This principle has\ntwo parts:\n\nGeneral results in arithmetical algebra belong to the laws\nof symbolical algebra.\nWhenever an interpretation of a result of symbolical algebra\nmade sense in the setting of arithmetical algebra, the result would\ngive a correct result in arithmetic.\n\n\n\nA fascinating use of algebra was introduced in 1814 by\nFran\u00e7ois-Joseph Servois (1776\u20131847) when he tackled\ndifferential equations by separating the differential operator \nfrom the subject, as described in an example given\nabove. This application of algebra captured the interest of Gregory\nwho published a number of papers on the method of the separation\nof symbols, that is, the separation into operators and objects,\nin the CMJ. He also wrote on the foundation of algebra, and\nit was Gregory\u2019s foundation that Boole embraced almost verbatim prior to writing LT.\nGregory had abandoned Peacock\u2019s principle of the permanence of\nequivalent forms in favor of three simple laws, one of which Boole\nregarded as merely a notation convention. Unfortunately these laws\nfell far short of what is required to justify even some of the most\nelementary results in algebra, like those involving subtraction.\n\n\n\nIn On the foundation of \nalgebra, 1839, the first of four papers on this \ntopic by De Morgan that appeared in the Transactions of the Cambridge\nPhilosophical Society, one finds a tribute to the separation of\nsymbols in algebra, and the claim that modern algebraists usually\nregard the symbols as denoting operators (e.g., the derivative\noperation) instead of objects like numbers. The footnote\nProfessor Peacock is the first, I believe, who distinctly\nset forth the difference between what I have called the technical and\nthe logical branches of algebra\n\n\ncredits Peacock with being the first to separate what are now called \nthe syntactic [technical] and the semantic [logical] aspects of algebra. \nIn the second\nfoundations paper (in 1841) De Morgan proposed what he considered to be\na complete set of eight rules for working with symbolical algebra.\n\nRegarding the origin of the name Boolean algebra, Charles\nSanders Peirce (1839\u20131914) introduced, among several other\nphrases, the name Boolian algebra for the algebra that\nresulted from dispensing with the arithmetical scaffolding of\nBoole\u2019s equational algebra of logic.  With the spelling\nBoolean algebra this was embraced by his close friend the\nHarvard philosopher Josiah Royce (1855\u20131916) around 1900, and\nthen by Royce\u2019s students (including Norbert Wiener, Henry\nM. Sheffer and Clarence I. Lewis) and in due course by other Harvard\nprofessors and the world. It essentially referred to the modern\nversion of the algebra of logic introduced in 1864 by William Stanley\nJevons (1835\u20131882), a version that Boole had rejected in their\ncorrespondence\u2014see Section 5.1. For this reason the word\nBoolean will not be used in this article to describe the\nalgebra of logic that Boole actually created; instead the name\nBoole\u2019s algebra will be used.  (See the 2015 article\n\u201cGeorge Boole and Boolean Algebra\u201d by Burris.)\n\n\nIn MAL, and more so in LT, Boole was interested in the insights\nthat his algebra of logic gave to the inner workings of the mind. This pursuit\nhas met with little favor, and is not discussed in this article.\n",
