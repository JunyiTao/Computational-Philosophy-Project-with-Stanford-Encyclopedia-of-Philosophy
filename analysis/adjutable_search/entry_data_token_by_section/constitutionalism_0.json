    "main_text": "Constitutionalism: a Minimal and a Rich Sense\n1. Constitutionalism: a Minimal and a Rich Sense\n\nIn some minimal sense of the term, a constitution consists of a set of\nnorms (rules, principles or values) creating, structuring, and\npossibly defining the limits of, government power or authority.\nUnderstood in this way, all states have constitutions and all states\nare constitutional states. Anything recognizable as a state must have\nsome means of constituting and specifying the limits (or lack thereof)\nplaced upon the three basic forms of government power: legislative\npower (making new laws), executive power (implementing laws) and\njudicial power (adjudicating disputes under\n laws).[1]\n Take the extreme case of an absolute sovereign, Rex, who combines\nunlimited power in all three domains. Suppose it is widely\nacknowledged that Rex has these powers, as well as the authority to\nexercise them at his pleasure. The constitution of this state might\nthen be said to contain only one rule, which grants unlimited power to\nRex. He is not legally answerable for the wisdom or morality\nof his decrees, nor is he bound by procedures, or any other kinds of\nlimitations or requirements, in exercising his powers. Whatever Rex\ndecrees is constitutionally valid.\n\nWhen scholars talk of constitutionalism, however, they normally mean\nsomething that rules out Rex\u2019s case. They mean not only that\nthere are norms creating legislative, executive and judicial powers,\nbut that these norms impose significant limits on those\n powers.[2]\n Often these limitations are in the form of civil rights against\ngovernment, rights to things like free expression, association,\nequality and due process of law. But constitutional limits come in a\nvariety of forms. They can concern such things as the scope\nof authority (e.g., in a federal system, provincial or state\ngovernments may have authority over health care and education while\nthe federal government\u2019s jurisdiction extends to national\ndefence and transportation); the mechanisms used in\nexercising the relevant power (e.g., procedural requirements governing\nthe form and manner of legislation); and of course civil\nrights (e.g., in a Charter or Bill of Rights). Constitutionalism\nin this richer sense of the term is the idea that government\ncan/should be limited in its powers and that its authority depends on\nits observing these limitations. In this richer sense of the term,\nRex\u2019s society has not embraced constitutionalism because the\nrule conferring his powers impose no constitutional limits on them.\nCompare a second state in which Regina has all the powers possessed by\nRex except that she lacks authority to legislate on matters concerning\nreligion. Suppose further that Regina also lacks the power to\nimplement, or to adjudicate on the basis of, any law which exceeds the\nscope of her legislative competence. We have here the seeds of\nconstitutionalism as that notion has come to be understood in Western\nlegal thought.\n\nIn discussing the history and nature of constitutionalism, a\ncomparison is often drawn between Thomas Hobbes and John Locke who are\nthought to have defended, respectively, the notion of constitutionally\nunlimited sovereignty (e.g., Rex) versus that of sovereignty limited\nby the terms of a social contract containing substantive limitations\n(e.g.,\n Regina).[3]\n But an equally good focal point is the English legal theorist John\nAustin who, like Hobbes, thought that the very notion of limited\nsovereignty is incoherent. For Austin, all law is the command of a\nsovereign person or body of persons, and so the notion that the\nsovereign could be limited by law requires a sovereign who is\nself-binding, who commands him/her/itself. But no one can command\nhimself, except in some figurative sense, so the notion of limited\nsovereignty is, for Austin (and Hobbes), as incoherent as the idea of\na square\n circle.[4]\n Though at one time this feature of Austin\u2019s theory had some\nsurface plausibility when applied to the British system of government,\nwhere Parliament was often said to be supreme and constitutionally\n unlimited,[5]\n it faces obvious difficulty when applied to most other constitutional\ndemocracies such as one finds in the United States, Canada, Mexico and\nGermany, where it is abundantly clear that the powers of government\nare legally limited by a constitution. Austin\u2019s answer to this\napparent weakness in his theory was to appeal to popular\nsovereignty, the idea that sovereign power ultimately resides in\n\u2018the people\u2019, that is, the population at large.\nGovernment bodies\u2014e.g., Parliament, the President or\nthe judiciary\u2014can be limited by constitutional law, but the\nsovereign people remain unlimited in their powers to command. Whether\nthis appeal to popular sovereignty provides Austin with an adequate\nmeans of dealing with constitutional democracies is questionable. For\nAustin\u2019s sovereign is supposed to be a determinate individual or\ngroup of individuals whose commands to the bulk of the\npopulation constitute law. But if we identify the commanders with\nthe people themselves, then we seem inexorably led to the paradoxical\nresult identified by H.L.A. Hart\u2014the commanders are commanding\nthe commanders. In short, we lapse into incoherence (Hart 1994,\n73\u201378; Austin 1995, Lecture VI).\n",
