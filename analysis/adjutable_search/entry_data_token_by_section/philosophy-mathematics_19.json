In recent years, the philosophy of set theory is emerging as\na philosophical discipline of its own. This is not to say that in\nspecific debates in the philosophy of set theory it cannot make an\nenormous difference whether one approaches it from a formalistic point\nof view or from a platonistic point of view, for instance.\n\nThe thesis that set theory is most suitable for serving as the\nfoundations of mathematics is by no means uncontroversial. Over the\npast decades, category theory has presented itself as a rival\nfor this role. Category theory is a mathematical theory that was\ndeveloped in the middle of the twentieth century. Unlike in set\ntheory, in category theory mathematical objects are only\ndefined up to isomorphism. This means that Benacerraf\u2019s\nidentification problem cannot be raised for category theoretical\nconcepts and \u2018objects\u2019. At the same time, (roughly)\neverything that can be done in set theory can be done in category\ntheory (but not always in a natural manner), and vice versa (again not\nalways in a natural manner). This means that for a structuralist\nperspective, category theory is an attractive candidate for providing\nthe foundations of mathematics (McLarty 2004).\n\nOne question that has been important from the beginning of set theory\nconcerns the difference between sets and proper classes. (This\nquestion has a natural counterpart for category theory: the difference\nbetween small and large categories.) Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument\nforces us to recognize that the set-theoretical universe as a whole\ncannot be regarded as a set. Cantor\u2019s Theorem shows that the\npower set (i.e., the set of all subsets) of any given set has a larger\ncardinality than the given set itself. Now suppose that the\nset-theoretical universe forms a set: the set of all sets. Then the\npower set of the set of all sets would have to be a subset of the set\nof all sets. This would contradict the fact that the power set of the\nset of all sets would have a larger cardinality than the set of all\nsets. So we must conclude that the set-theoretical universe cannot\nform a set.\n\nCantor called pluralities that are too large to be considered as a set\ninconsistent multiplicities (Cantor 1932). Today,\nCantor\u2019s inconsistent multiplicities are called proper\nclasses. Some philosophers of mathematics hold that proper\nclasses still constitute unities, and hence can be seen as a sort of\ncollection. They are, in a Cantorian spirit, just collections that are\ntoo large to be sets. Nevertheless, there are problems with this view.\nJust as there can be no set of all sets, there can for diagonalization\nreasons also not be a proper class of all proper classes. So the\nproper class view seems compelled to recognize in addition a realm of\nsuper-proper classes, and so on. For this reason, Zermelo claimed that\nproper classes simply do not exist. This position is less strange than\nit looks at first sight. On close inspection, one sees that in ZFC one\nnever needs to quantify over entities that are too large to be sets\n(although there exist systems of set theory that do quantify over\nproper classes). On this view, the set-theoretical universe is\npotentially infinite in an absolute sense of the word. It never exists\nas a completed whole, but is forever growing, and hence forever\nunfinished (Zermelo 1930). This way of speaking indicates that in our\nattempts to understand this notion of potential infinity, we are drawn\nto temporal metaphors. It is not surprising that these temporal\nmetaphors cause some philosophers of mathematics acute discomfort. For\nthis reason, contemporary philosophers of mathematics who are\nsympathetic to Zermelo\u2019s potentialist interpretation of the set\ntheoretic universe, tend to regard the modality involved in this\ninterpretation as a non-temporal one: the nature of this modality is\nhotly debated (Linnebo 2013, Studd 2019).\n\nA second subject in the philosophy of set theory concerns the\njustification of the accepted basic principles of mathematics, i.e.,\nthe axioms of ZFC. An important historical case study is the process\nby which the Axiom of Choice came to be accepted by the mathematical\ncommunity in the early decades of the twentieth century (Moore 1982).\nThe importance of this case study is largely due to the fact that an\nopen and explicit discussion of its acceptability was held in the\nmathematical community. In this discussion, general reasons for\naccepting or refusing to accept a principle as a basic axiom came to\nthe surface. On the systematic side, two conceptions of the notion of\nset have been elaborated which aim to justify all axioms of ZFC in one\nfell swoop. On the one hand, there is the iterative\nconception of sets, which describes how the set-theoretical\nuniverse can be thought of as generated from the empty set by means of\nthe power set operation (Boolos 1971, Linnebo 2013). On the other\nhand, there is the limitation of size conception of sets,\nwhich states that every collection which is not too big to be a set,\nis a set (Hallett 1984). The iterative conception motivates some\naxioms of ZFC very well (the power set axiom, for instance), but fares\nless well with respect to other axioms, such as the replacement axiom\n(Potter 2004, Part IV). The limitation of size conception motivates\nother axioms better (such as the restricted comprehension axiom). It\nseems fair to say that there is no uniform conception that\nclearly justifies all axioms of ZFC.\n\nThe motivation of putative axioms that go beyond ZFC constitutes a\nthird concern of the philosophy of set theory (Maddy 1988; Martin\n1998). One such class of principles is constituted by the large\ncardinal axioms. Nowadays, large cardinal hypotheses are really\ntaken to mean some kind of embedding properties between the set\ntheoretic universe and inner models of set theory (Kanamori 2009).\nMost of the time, large cardinal principles entail the existence of\nsets that are larger than any sets which can be guaranteed by ZFC to\nexist.\n\nThe weaker of the large cardinal principles are supported by intrinsic\nevidence (see\n section 3.1).\n They follow from what are called reflection principles.\nThese are principles that state that the set theoretic universe as a\nwhole is so rich that it is very similar to some set-sized initial\nsegment of it. The stronger of the large cardinal principles hitherto\nonly enjoy extrinsic support. Many researchers are skeptical about the\npossibility that reflection principles, for instance, can be found\nthat support them (Koellner 2009); others, however, disagree (Welch\n& Horsten 2016).\n\nG\u00f6del hoped that on the basis of such large cardinal axioms, the\nmost important open question of set theory could eventually be\nsettled. This is the continuum problem. The continuum\nhypothesis was proposed by Cantor in the late nineteenth century.\nIt states that there are no sets S which are too large for there to be\na one-to-one correspondence between S and the natural numbers, but too\nsmall for there to exist a one-to-one correspondence between S and the\nreal numbers. Despite strenuous efforts, all attempts to settle the\ncontinuum problem failed. G\u00f6del came to suspect that the\ncontinuum hypothesis is independent of the accepted principles of set\ntheory (ZFC). Around 1940, he managed to show that the continuum\nhypothesis is consistent with ZFC. A few decades later, Paul Cohen\nproved that the negation of the continuum hypothesis is also\nconsistent with ZFC. Thus G\u00f6del\u2019s conjecture of the\nindependence of the continuum hypothesis was eventually confirmed.\n\nBut G\u00f6del\u2019s hope that large cardinal axioms could solve the\ncontinuum problem turned out to be unfounded. The continuum hypothesis\nis independent of ZFC even in the context of large cardinal axioms.\nNevertheless, large cardinal principles have manage to settle\nrestricted versions of the continuum hypothesis (in the affirmative).\nThe existence of so-called Woodin cardinals ensures that sets\ndefinable in analysis are either countable or the size of the\ncontinuum. Thus the definable continuum problem is\nsettled.\n\nIn recent years, attempts have been focused on finding principles of a\ndifferent kind which might be justifiable and which might yet decide\nthe continuum hypothesis (Woodin 2001a, Woodin 2001b). One of the more\ngeneral philosophical questions that have emerged from this research\nis the following: which conditions have to be satisfied in order for a\nprinciple to be a putative basic axiom of mathematics?\n\nSome of the researchers who seek to decide the continuum hypothesis\nthink that it is true; others think that it is false. But there are\nalso many set theorists and philosophers of mathematics who believe\nthat the continuum hypothesis not just undecidable in ZFC but\nabsolutely undecidable, i.e. that it is neither provable (in\nthe informal sense of the word) nor disprovable (in the informal sense\nof the word) because it is neither true nor false. If the mathematical\nuniverse is a set theoretic multiverse, for instance, then\nthere are equally models that make the continuum hypothesis true and\nequally good models that make it false, and there is no more to be\nsaid (Hamkins, 2015).\n",
