    "main_text": "Things and Realities\n4. Things and Realities\n\nThe divine names designate the universal qualities that suffuse\nexistence, such as life, knowledge, desire, power, speech, generosity,\nand justice (these often being called \u201cthe seven leaders\u201d\namong the names). These qualities are found in everything, because\nthey pertain to the very Essence of the Real and accompany its\nself-disclosure. They remain largely nonmanifest, however, because\neach thing has its own preparedness (isti\u2018d\u00e2d) or\nreceptivity (q\u00e2biliyya), and none can display the Real\nper se. Although each thing is a face, each is also a veil; He/not\nHe.\n\nGod says, \u201cThe giving of your Lord can never be walled up\u201d\n(Koran 17:20). In other words, it can never be withheld. God is saying\nthat He gives constantly, while the loci receive in the measure of the\nrealities of their preparedness. In the same way, you say that the sun\nspreads its rays over the existent things. It is not miserly with its\nlight toward anything. The loci receive the light in the measure of\ntheir preparedness. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 1:287.10)\n\n\nWhat then determines the measure of preparedness? This goes back to a\nthing\u2019s \u201creality\u201d (haq\u00eeqa), its\n\u201cwhatness\u201d or \u201cquiddity\u201d\n(m\u00e2hiyya). This is determined not by our definitions,\nbut by God\u2019s knowledge, because he knows the thing always and\nforever, whether or not it exists in the cosmos. Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee commonly refers to the realities simply as\n\u201cthings\u201d (ashy\u00e2\u2019, pl. of\nshay\u2019) or \u201centities\u201d\n(a\u2018y\u00e2n, pl. of \u2018ayn). They do not\nexist in themselves, because nothing truly exists but the Real Being,\nso they are \u201cthe nonexistents\u201d\n(al-ma\u2018d\u00fbm\u00e2t). In philosophical terms, they\nare \u201cpossible\u201d (mumkin), so they may or may not\ncome to exist, in contrast to the Real Being, which is necessary\n(w\u00e2jib), so it cannot not exist.\n\nWhat exactly are things? They are the concomitants\n(law\u00e2zim) of Being, or the potentialities of\nmanifestation latent in Infinite Possibility, or the never-ending\ndelimitations of the Nondelimited. If a thing is found in the cosmos,\nit is a specific self-disclosure of Real Being, a face of God, a word\narticulated in the All-Merciful Breath, a color made visible by the\nradiance of Light. Inasmuch as things appear, they display Being and\nits attributes; inasmuch as their receptivity is delimited and\ndefined, they act as veils. Each is a barzakh, an imaginal\nthing, simultaneously an image of Being and an image of\nnothingness.\n\nThere is no true being that does not accept change except God, for\nthere is nothing in realized Being but God. As for everything other\nthan He, that dwells in imaginal being\u2026. Everything other than\nthe Essence of the Real is intervening imagination and vanishing\nshadow. No created thing remains upon a single state in this world,\nthe next world, and what is between the two, neither spirit, nor soul,\nnor anything other than the Essence of God. Rather, each continuously\nchanges from form to form, constantly and forever. And imagination is\nnothing but this\u2026. So the cosmos only became manifest within\nimagination\u2026. It is it, and it is not it. (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n2:313.12)\n\n\nThe philosophers and theologians commonly debated God\u2019s\nknowledge of the particulars. The Koran says repeatedly that God knows\neverything. \u201cNot a leaf falls\u201d, it says, \u201cbut God\nknows it\u201d (6:59). Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee holds that God\u2019s\nknowledge of both universals and particulars pertains to the Essence\nand does not change. God knows the falling leaf always and forever,\nand when it is time for it to fall, he says to it, \u201cFall!\u201d\nSo also are all things: \u201cHis only command, when He desires a\nthing, is to say to it \u2018Be!\u2019, and it comes to be\u201d\n(Koran 36:82).\n\nIn themselves the known things are nonexistent (like ideas that have\nno existence outside our minds), but when God issues the\n\u201cengendering command\u201d (al-amr\nal-takw\u00een\u00ee)\u2014the word \u201cBe!\u201d\n(kun)\u2014they enter into being (kawn). Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee calls the thingness of the things in the divine\nknowledge \u201cthe thingness of fixity\u201d (shay\u2019iyyat\nal-thub\u00fbt), because the things in themselves never change.\nDespite appearances, the engendering command does not remove them from\ntheir fixity, for nothing becomes manifest but Being, though delimited\nand defined by the thingness of the things. The common example is\nlight: When it shines through a piece of colored glass, it appears as\ncolored, but light alone is manifest.\n",
