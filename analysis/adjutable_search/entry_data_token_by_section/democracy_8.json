We begin by examining a core challenge to the\nidea that democratic citizens are capable of governing a large and\ncomplex society. We then explore different proposed solutions to the\ncore challenge. Finally, we examine the moral duties of democratic\ncitizens in large-scale democracies in light of the core\nchallenge.\n",
