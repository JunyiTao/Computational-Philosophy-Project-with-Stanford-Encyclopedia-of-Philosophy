    "main_text": "The Human Genome Project: From Genomics to Postgenomics || Race to the Genome\n1.2 Race to the Genome\n\nSuddenly, the publicly funded HGP faced a challenge from the private\nsector. In May 1998, TIGR\u2019s J. Craig Venter announced a\npartnership with Applied Biosystems to sequence the entire genome in\nthree short years and for a fraction of the cost. The new company,\nbased in Rockville, MD and later named Celera Genomics, planned to use\n\u201cwhole-genome shotgun\u201d (WGS) sequencing, an approach\ndifferent from the HGP\u2019s. The HGP confined the shotgun method to\ncloned fragments already mapped to specific chromosomal regions: these\nare broken down into smaller bits then amplified by bacterial clones,\nsequences are generated randomly by automated machines, and\ncomputational resources are used to reassemble sequence using\noverlapping areas of bits. Shotgunning is followed by painstaking\n\u201cfinishing\u201d to fill in gaps, correct mistakes, and resolve\nambiguities. What Celera was proposing for the shotgun method was to\nbreak the organism\u2019s entire genome into millions of pieces of\nDNA with high-frequency sound waves, sequence these pieces using\nhundreds of Applied Biosystem\u2019s new capillary model machines,\nand reassemble the sequences with one of the world\u2019s largest\ncivilian supercomputers without the assistance provided by the\npreliminary mapping of clones to chromosomes. When WGS sequencing was\nconsidered as a possibility by the HGP, it was rejected because of the\nrisk that repeat sequences would yield mistakes in reassembly (Green\n1997; Venter et al. 1996; Weber and Myers 1997). But Venter by this\ntime had successfully used the method to sequence the 1.83 million\nnucleotide bases of the bacterium Hemophilus\ninfluenzae\u2014the first free-living organism to be completely\nsequenced\u2014in a year\u2019s time (Fleischmann et al. 1995).\n\nHGP scientists downplayed the media image of a race to sequence the\ngenome often over the next couple of years, but they were certainly\npropelled by worries that funding would dry up before the sequence was\ncomplete given private sector willingness to take over and that the\nsequence data would become proprietary information. Wellcome more than\ndoubled its funds to the Sanger Centre (to \u00a3205 million) and the\ncenter changed its goal from sequencing one-sixth of the genome to\nsequencing one-third, and possibly one-half (Dickson 1998). The NHGRI\nand DOE published a new five-year plan for 1998-2003 (Collins et al.\n1998). The plan moved the final completion date forward from 2005 to\n2003 and aimed for a \u201cworking draft\u201d of the human genome\nsequence to be completed by December 2001. This would be achieved by\ndelaying the finishing process, no longer going clone-by-clone to\nshotgun, reassemble, and finish the sequence of one clone before\nproceeding to the next. With only six percent of the human genome\nsequence completed, the plan called for new and improved sequencing\ntechnologies that could increase the sequencing capacity from 90 Mb\nper year at about $.50 per base to 500 Mb per year at no more than\n$.25 per base. Goals for completing the sequencing of the remaining\nmodel organisms were also set: December 1998 for C. elegans\nwhich was 80 percent complete, 2002 for D. melanogaster which\nwas nine percent complete, and 2005 for M. musculus which was\nstill at the physical mapping stage.\n\nAn interim victory for the publicly funded project followed when, on\nschedule, the first animal sequence, that of C. elegans with\n97 million bases and 19,099 genes, was published in Science\nin December 1998 (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998).\nThis was the product of a 10-year collaboration between scientists at\nWashington University in St. Louis (headed by Bob Waterston) and the\nSanger Centre (headed by John Sulston), carried out at a\nsemi-industrial scale with more than 200 people employed in each lab\nworking around the clock. In March 1999, the main players\u2014the\nNHGRI, Sanger Centre, and DOE\u2014advanced the date of completion of\nthe \u201cworking draft\u201d: five-fold coverage of at least 90\npercent of the genome was to be completed by the following spring\n(Pennisi 1999; Wadman 1999). This change reflected improved output of\nthe new model of automated sequencing machines, diminished sequencing\ncosts at $.20 to $.30 per base, and the desire to speed up the release\nof medically relevant data. NHGRI would take responsibility for 60\npercent of the sequence, concentrating these efforts at Baylor,\nWashington University, and Whitehead/MIT; 33 percent of the sequence\nwould be the responsibility of the Sanger Centre; and the remaining\nsequence would be supplied by the DOE\u2019s Joint Genome Institute\n(JGI) in Walnut Creek, CA into which its three centers had merged in\nJanuary 1997.\n\nThe first chromosomes to be completed (this was to finished, not\nworking draft, standards) were the two smallest: the sequence for\nchromosome 22 was published by scientists at the Sanger Centre and\npartners at University of Oklahoma, Washington University in St.\nLouis, and Keio University in Japan in December 1999 (Dunham et al.\n1999); the sequence for chromosome 21 was published by an\ninternational consortium of mostly Japanese and German labs\u2014with\nhalf the sequencing carried out at Japan\u2019s RIKEN\u2014in May\n2000 (Hattori et al. 2000). The remaining chromosomes lagged behind.\nOn 26 June 2000, when Collins, Venter, and the DOE\u2019s Patrinos\njoined U.S. President Bill Clinton (and British Prime Minister Tony\nBlair by satellite link) at a White House press conference (see\nClinton, et al. 2000) to announce that the human genome had been\nsequenced, this was more an arranged truce than a tie for the prize.\nAn editorial in Nature described the fanfare of 26 June as an\n\u201cextravagant\u201d example\u2014one reaching \u201can all-out\nzenith or nadir, according to taste\u201d\u2014of scientists making\npublic announcements not linked to peer-reviewed publication, here to\nbolster share prices (Celera) and for political effect (the HGP) given\nthe \u201cmonths to go before even a draft sequence will be\nscientifically useful\u201d (Anonymous 2000, p. 981). Neither of the\ntwo sequence maps was complete (Pennisi 2000). The HGP had not met its\nprevious year\u2019s goal of a working draft covering 90 percent of\nthe genome. Assisted by its researchers\u2019 access to HGP data\nstored on public\n databases,[1]\n Celera\u2019s efforts were accepted as being further along: the\ncompany\u2019s press release that day announced 99 percent coverage\nof the genome.\n\nPeer-reviewed publications came almost eight months later. Negotiated\nplans for joint publication in Science broke down when terms\nof agreement over data release could not be negotiated, with the\njournal\u2019s editors willing to publish Celera\u2019s findings\nwithout Venter meeting the standard requirement that the sequence data\nbe submitted to GenBank. Press conferences in London and Washington,\nD.C. on 12 February preceded publications that week\u2014by HGP\nscientists in Nature on 15 February 2001 and by\nVenter\u2019s team in Science on 16 February 2001. The HGP\ndraft genome sequence covered about 94 percent of the genome, with\nabout 25 percent in the finished form already attained for chromosomes\n21 and 22. Indeed, the authors themselves described it as \u201can\nincomplete, intermediate product\u201d which \u201ccontains many\ngaps and errors\u201d (International Human Genome Sequencing\nConsortium 2001, p. 871). The results published by Celera had\n84\u201390 percent of the genome covered by scaffolds at least 100 kb\nin length, with the composition of the scaffolds averaging 91\u201392\npercent sequence and 8\u20139 percent gaps (Venter et al. 2001). In\nthe end, Celera\u2019s published genome assembly made significant use\nof the HGP\u2019s publicly available map and sequence data, which\nleft open for debate the question whether WGS sequencing alone would\nhave worked (see Waterston et al. 2002; Green 2002; and Myers et al.\n2002).\n\nSince the gaps in the sequence were unlikely to contain genes, and\nonly genes as functional segments of DNA have potential commercial\nvalue, Celera was happy to leave the gaps for the HGP scientists to\nfill in. Despite being timed to coincide with celebrations of the\n50th anniversary of the Watson\u2013Crick discovery of the\ndouble-helical structure of DNA, there was less fanfare surrounding\nthe official date of completion of the HGP in April 2003, two years\nearlier than had been anticipated at the time of its official launch\nin October 1990, and several months earlier than called for in the\nmost recent five-year plan. In the end, sequencing\u2014the third\nphase of the publicly-funded project\u2014was carried out at 16\ncenters in six countries by divvying up among them sections of\nchromosomes for sequencing. 85 percent of the sequencing, however, was\ndone at the five major sequencing centers (Baylor, Washington\nUniversity, Whitehead/MIT, Sanger Center, and DOE\u2019s JGI), with\nthe Sanger Centre responsible for nearly one-third. The cost was lower\nthan anticipated, with $2.7 billion spent by U.S. agencies and\n\u00a3150 million spent by Wellcome Trust. The \u201cfinished\u201d\nreference DNA sequence for Homo sapiens was made publicly\naccessible on the Internet. However, for various technical reasons,\nthe human genome\u2019s 3.1 billion nucleotide bases had not yet been\ncompletely sequenced at the close of the HGP in\n 2003.[2]\n",
