Socrates\n\nImage \u00a9 The Museum of Modern Art;\n\nLicensed by Scala/Art Resource, NY\n\n\u00a92005 Artists Rights Society (ARS),\n\nNew York/ADAGP, Paris\n\nreproduced with permission\n\nof the Brancusi Estate\n\n\nThe philosopher Socrates remains, as he was in his lifetime\n(469\u2013399\n B.C.E.),[1]\n an enigma, an inscrutable individual who, despite having written\nnothing, is considered one of the handful of philosophers who forever\nchanged how philosophy itself was to be conceived. All our information\nabout him is second-hand and most of it vigorously disputed, but his\ntrial and death at the hands of the Athenian democracy is nevertheless\nthe founding myth of the academic discipline of philosophy, and his\ninfluence has been felt far beyond philosophy itself, and in every\nage. Because his life is widely considered paradigmatic not only for\nthe philosophic life but, more generally, for how anyone ought to\nlive, Socrates has been encumbered with the adulation and emulation\nordinarily reserved for religious figures \u2013 strange for someone\nwho tried so hard to make others do their own thinking and for someone\nconvicted and executed on the charge of irreverence toward the gods.\nCertainly he was impressive, so impressive that many others were moved\nto write about him, all of whom found him strange by the conventions\nof fifth-century Athens: in his appearance, personality, and behavior,\nas well as in his views and methods.\n\nSo thorny is the difficulty of distinguishing the historical Socrates\nfrom the Socrateses of the authors of the texts in which he appears\nand, moreover, from the Socrateses of scores of later interpreters,\nthat the whole contested issue is generally referred to as the\nSocratic problem. Each age, each intellectual turn, produces a\nSocrates of its own. It is no less true now that, \u201cThe\n\u2018real\u2019 Socrates we have not: what we have is a set of\ninterpretations each of which represents a \u2018theoretically\npossible\u2019 Socrates,\u201d as Cornelia de Vogel (1955, 28) put\nit. In fact, de Vogel was writing as a new analytic paradigm for\ninterpreting Socrates was about to become standard\u2014Gregory\nVlastos\u2019s model (\u00a72.2), which would hold sway until the mid\n1990s. Who Socrates really was is fundamental to virtually any\ninterpretation of the philosophical dialogues of Plato because\nSocrates is the dominant figure in most of Plato\u2019s\ndialogues.\n",
