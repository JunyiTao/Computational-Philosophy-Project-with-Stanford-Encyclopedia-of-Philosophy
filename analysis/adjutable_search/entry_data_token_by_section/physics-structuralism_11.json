    "main_text": "Problems of reduction || Scheibe\u2019s account\n4.5 Scheibe\u2019s account\n\nScheibe in his (1999) also explicitly refers to the theses of Kuhn and\nFeyerabend and gives a detailed discussion. Unlike the other two\nstructuralistic programs, he does not propose a fixed concept of\nreduction. Rather he suggests a lot of special reduction relations\nwhich can be combined appropriately to connect two theories \\(T\\) and\n\\(T'\\). Moreover, he proceeds by means of extensive real-life case\nstudies and considers new types of reduction relations if the case\nunder consideration cannot be described by the relations considered so\nfar. Scheibe concedes that there are instances of incommensurability\nwhich make it difficult to find a reduction relation in certain cases.\nAs a significant example he mentions the notions of an\n\u201cobservable\u201d in quantum mechanics on the one hand, and in\nclassical statistical mechanics on the other hand. Although there are\nmaps between the respective sets of observables, Scheibe considers\nthis as a case of incommensurability, since these maps are not Lie\nalgebra homomorphisms, see Scheibe (1999, 174).\n\nSummarizing, the structuralistic approaches are capable of discussing\nthe issues of reduction and incommensurability and the underlying\nproblems on an advanced level. Thereby these approaches have a chance\nof mediating between disparate camps of physicists and\nphilosophers.\n",
