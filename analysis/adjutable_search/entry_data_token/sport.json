Indeed,\nthe philosophy of sport as an academic sub-field dates back only to\nthe 1970s. Yet, in this short time, it has grown into a vibrant area\nof philosophical research that promises both to deepen our\nunderstanding of sport and to inform sports practice. Recent\ncontroversies at the elite and professional level have highlighted the\nethical dimensions of sport in particular. Lance Armstrong\u2019s use\nof performance-enhancing drugs raised new issues in the ethics of\ncheating, middle-distance runner Caster Semenya has challenged\nprevailing rules around sex classification in sport, and Oscar\nPistorius\u2019s prosthesis has problematized the distinction between\nable-bodied and disabled sport.  While philosophical analysis may help\nto achieve a deeper understanding of sport, such analysis may also\nilluminate problems of philosophy beyond sport, ranging from the\nnature of skill to the ethics of altruism.\n\nThis entry proceeds in three sections. Section 1 introduces the\nphilosophy of sport with particular emphasis on the history of\nsystematic philosophical thinking about sport. Section 2 examines the\nnature and value of sport, and it considers the main normative theories\nof sport developed in the literature. Section 3 addresses a cluster of\ntopics that are central to the philosophy of sport, including:\nsportsmanship; cheating; performance enhancement; violent and dangerous\nsport; sex, gender, and race; fans and spectators; disability\nsport; and the aesthetics of sport.\n", "toc": [{"#Intr": "1.

Introduction\n1.1 Background: Sport, Culture, and Philosophical Thinking\n\n\nHuman communities have engaged in sport for reasons as diverse as\namusement, religious worship and political stability (Baker, 1988).\nAncient Sumerians and Egyptians practised sport to prepare themselves\nfor war. So too did ancient Greeks and Romans, for whom sport also had\nimportant religious and social signification. For instance, in\nClassical Greece, athletic contests (gymnikoi agones)\nprovided an arena for the cultivation and demonstration of excellence\n(arete). This pursuit of excellence through sport played a\nmajor role in Hellenistic culture, where striving for perfection in\nbody and mind served as one of the society\u2019s principal unifying\nactivities (Lunt & Dyreson, 2014). Likewise, in the Mayan\ncivilization, ballgames served religious, social, and political\npurposes such as providing a common bond while downplaying differences\nand conflict arising from local diversity (Fox, 2012).\n\n\nPhilosophers have reflected on the nature of sport at least since\nAncient Greece. Plato and Aristotle viewed sport as a key component of\neducation and, by extension, human flourishing (Reid, 2011,\n26\u201380). An educated Greek must find harmony between body and\nmind by, among other things, engaging in athletic contests. Reflection\non the role sports play in human life and culture continued during\nRoman times and the medieval era. In Rome, sports were understood\ninstrumentally as tools to train warriors. For instance, the fifth\nbook of Virgil\u2019s Aeneid is devoted to the celebration of\ncontests of speed and strength with an emphasis on preparing Romans\nfor war. In medieval times, despite losing relevance in the public\nsphere, sport played a significant role in Christian imagery (Reid,\n2011, 81\u2013106). For example, in City of God, Augustine\n(14.9) referred to the apostle Paul as \u2018the athlete of\nChrist\u2019. Thomas Aquinas, like Plato and Aristotle, advocated for\nthe need to cultivate body and soul to flourish as human beings\n(Kretchmar et al., 2017, 93\u2013120). \n\n\nIn early modernity, sport regained prominence in public life, not\nleast on account of its potential to cultivate human excellence and\npromote the good life. Renaissance schoolmasters included sport in\ntheir curricula. Even Protestant thinkers, often thought to have been\nopposed to leisurely activities such as sports, embraced the practice\nof athletic activities for formative purposes (Reid, 2012). Martin\nLuther and John Milton advocated for the utilization of sport\nactivities to educate individuals and train Christian soldiers\n(Overman, 2011). During the Enlightenment, drawing on the empiricists\u2019\nemphasis on the cultivation of bodily capacities to achieve accurate\nsensory data, Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued for the need to exercise and\ndevelop body and mind harmoniously (Andrieu, 2014). Rousseau\u2019s\npedagogical theory, along with several others, was implemented in the\n19th-century Victorian England and Germany, where sports were valued as\ncharacter-building activities. Inspired by these pedagogical\nphilosophies, Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the Olympic Movement,\nregarding Olympic sport as a \u2018philosophy of life which places\nsport at the service of humanity\u2019 (IOC 2019; see also McFee 2012;\nParry 2006).\n\n\nIn contemporary society, sport plays a central role in the lives of\ncountless players, coaches, officials, and spectators. The teaching of\nsport is part of national school curricula, sports news forms part of\nour national media, and sport has been deployed as a public policy\nmeasure to address everything from anti-social behaviour to obesity.\nHowever, despite the role sport has played throughout human history,\nthe philosophy of sport as an academic sub-discipline did not develop\nuntil the middle of the 20th century. We recount some of the\nfield\u2019s history now.\n1.2 History of the Philosophy of Sport\n\n\nThe philosophy of sport was pre-dated and inspired by the philosophy\nof play, most notably Johan Huizinga\u2019s Homo Ludens\n(1938). However, sport is a distinctive type of play and not every\ninstance of sport is an instance of play (Suits, 1988), so sport\nrequires independent philosophical analysis. In the philosophy of sport\nliterature, myriad characterizations and definitions of the nature and\nscope of the field have been proffered (Torres, 2014, 4\u20135). For Paul\nWeiss, the philosophy of sport provides an \u2018examination of sport\nin terms of principles which are to be at once revelatory of the nature\nof sport and pertinent to other fields \u2013 indeed, to the whole of\nthings and knowledge\u2019 (Weiss, 1971, vii-viii). According to\nRobert G. Osterhoudt, first editor of the Journal of the Philosophy\nof Sport, this branch of Philosophy is committed \u2018to\nthe presentation of genuinely philosophical examinations, or reflective\nauthentic examinations of the nature of sport \u2026 and systematic\ndiscussions of issues peculiar to sport until they are reduced to\nmatters of a distinctly philosophical order\u2019 (Osterhoudt, 1973,\nix\u2013xi).\n\n\nR. Scott Kretchmar (1997) has suggested that, from the 1870s to the\n1990s, the philosophy of sport evolved from being a sub-branch of the\nphilosophy of education to being a field of study in its own right.\nDuring this time, the field went through three phases: the\n\u2018eclectic\u2019 phase, the \u2018system-based\u2019 phase and\nthe \u2018disciplinary\u2019 phase. In the eclectic phase, also\nreferred to as \u2018philosophy-of-education period,\u2019\nphilosophies of education laid the ground for the philosophical study\nof sport. Challenging the dominant intellectualist pedagogical\ntradition, philosophers such as William James, Edward L. Thorndike, and\nJohn Dewey emphasized the value of play, games, and sport in preparing\nhuman beings for achieving good lives. Physical educators Thomas D.\nWood and Clark Hetherington, among others, built upon these\nphilosophers to develop what was called \u2018The New Physical\nEducation,\u2019 a pedagogical movement aimed at showing that physical\neducation should become an integral part of overall human education.\nThese educators, despite contributing little to philosophical\ndiscussion, helped to generate an era where physical education was\nrequired in most educational programs.\n\n\nIn the \u2018system-based period,\u2019 pedagogical concerns\nmotivated the philosophical analysis of sport and physical exercise.\nHowever, the protagonists of this phase, such as Elwood Craig David and\nEarle Ziegler, relied on a method that placed greater weight on\nphilosophical modes of analysis. They began by describing and comparing\ndifferent philosophical systems, distilled them to the basic concepts\nand positions that related to physical education, and finished by\ndrawing practical implications and pedagogical recommendations. Their\nemphasis on philosophical systems created a fertile ground for the\ndevelopment of the philosophy of sport. As William J. Morgan (2000,\n205) notes, this shift in emphasis led to the progressive displacement\nof science and pedagogy as the main pillars of physical education\ncurricula, and it facilitated a broader approach to the study of\nphysical exercise and sport that gave pride of place to cultural and\nhistorical dimensions. \n\n\nThis evolution within physical education departments during the\n\u2018disciplinary phase\u2019 facilitated the emergence of the\nphilosophy of sport as a discipline in its own right. The Philosophic\nSociety for the Study of Sport (PSSS) was formed during the celebration\nof the 1972 Eastern Division conference of the American Philosophical\nAssociation (APA) in Boston; the organization\u2019s name was changed\nto International Association for the Philosophy of Sport (IAPS) in\n1999. The Society founded a scholarly journal, the Journal of the\nPhilosophy of Sport (JPS), and established that the mission of the\nSociety and the Journal was \u2018to foster interchange and\nscholarship among those interested in the scholarly study of\nsport\u2019 (Fraleigh 1983: 6). Weiss\u2019 contribution to the formation\nof the discipline in its early stages was crucial. With the publication\nof Sport: A Philosophic Inquiry in 1969, Weiss, a philosopher\nof international repute, demonstrated that sport provided a fertile\nground for philosophical inquiry. Along with Weiss, other pioneers of\nthe philosophical analysis of sport were Eleanor Metheny (1952, 1965)\nand Howard S. Slusher (1967), who also helped to consolidate the\nnascent sub-discipline by publishing monographs in the philosophy of\nsport. \n\n\nEarly philosophy of sport divided along \u2018analytic\u2019 and\n\u2018continental\u2019 lines. Klaus V. Meier (1988), Bernard Suits\n(1977), and Frank McBride (1975, 1979) focused on the possibility of\nproviding individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for\nsomething to be a \u2018sport\u2019. They drew on tools from\nanalytical philosophy to analyse the use of the term\n\u2018sport\u2019 (in both plain and academic language) and to\nattempt to identify traits common to all sports. Early philosophers of\nsport also examined sport phenomenologically. R. Scott Kretchmar, Drew\nH. Hyland, and Robert G. Osterhoudt, among others, drew on the works of\nEugene Fink, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Georg W. F. Hegel, Martin\nHeidegger, and Edmund Husserl to study the nature of sport by focusing\non the lived experiences of those individuals engaged in it.\n\n\nMore recently, the philosophy of sport has transitioned into a\n\u2018hermeneutic\u2019 or \u2018applied philosophy\u2019 phase\n(Lopez Frias, 2017; McNamee, 2007). The field took a\n\u2018practical\u2019 turn in the 1990s.  The work of Alasdair\nMacIntyre, especially his seminal work After Virtue (1984),\nplayed a key role in this shift among philosophers of sport towards\nnormative issues. Drawing on MacIntyre\u2019s concept of\n\u2018social practice,\u2019 philosophers of sport aimed to identify\nthe intrinsic goods and excellences of sport in order to assess and\ncritique sport and related ethical issues such as doping, cheating,\nand sportsmanship.\n\n\nClassic debates concerning the nature of sport and the phenomenology\nof participants\u2019 experience have not been abandoned, however. As we\nwill show later (section 2.1), the debate on the nature of sport\nremains central. Indeed, the rise of electronic games (so-called\n\u2018eSports\u2019) has reignited discussion of the defining\nelements of sport and, more broadly, the contrast between traditional\ngames and digital games (Conway, 2016). In particular, philosophers\nof sport have explored the question of whether eSports test physical\nskills (Van Hilvoorde, 2017; Holt, 2016), the implications of the\ninstitutionalization of eSport competitions (Hemphill, 2005; Parry,\n2018), and moral engagement in digital gaming (Edgar, 2016). \n\n\nStill more prominent is the phenomenology of sport. The rapid\nprogression of computational science and neuroscience has had a\nprofound influence in the philosophy of sport, encouraging exponential\ngrowth in publications concerning skill acquisition in sport\n(Ilund\u00e1in-Agurruza, 2016), the mind-body relationship (Gerber\nand Morgan, 1979), and sport experience (Breivik, 2014). The aesthetics\nof sport has also flourished in recent decades by focusing on two\nthemes (Edgar, 2014): the nature and relevance of aesthetic qualities\n(e.g. beauty, ugliness, grace, and strength) to the experience of\npractising and watching sport (see also Kreft, 2012; Lacerda and\nMumford, 2010; Lacerda, 2012) and the consideration of sport as an art\nand its relationship to art (see also Best, 1974, 1985; Elcombe, 2012;\nGaffney, 2013). So, while still an emergent field, the philosophy of\nsport has progressed quickly in developing central methods and\npreoccupations.\n2. What is Sport?\n\n\nPhilosophical theories of sport take descriptive or normative forms.\nBroadly speaking, descriptive theories attempt to provide an accurate\naccount of sport\u2019s central concepts, and normative theories\nattempt to provide an account of how sport should be. Normative\ntheories of sport are broadly classified as either\n\u2018externalist\u2019 or \u2018internalist.\u2019 Externalist\ntheories of sport understand sport as a reflection of larger social\nphenomena. Heavily influenced by Marxism and structuralism, externalist\nphilosophers take the nature of sport to be determined by principles\nfrom other practices or the larger society. William J. Morgan (1994)\nidentifies three types of externalist theories: \u2018Commodification\ntheory,\u2019 \u2018New Left theory,\u2019 and \u2018Hegemony\ntheory.\u2019 In Commodification theory, sport is understood as a\ncommodity with use- and exchange-value. When sports are commodified,\nthey are viewed not as having inherent characteristics worthy of\nprotection, but solely according to the economic profit that they can\ngenerate (Sandel, 2012; Walsh and Giulianotti, 2007). The main\nproponents of the New Left theory theory are Bero Rigauer (1981),\nJean-Marie Brohm (1978), Rob Beamish (1981), Richard Lipsky (1981), and\nPaul Hoch (1972). They understood sport materialistically by focusing\non the role that sport plays in the genesis and reproduction of social\nhistory, mostly by exploring the connection between labor, economic\ninfrastructure, and sport. Hegemony theories of sport attack the\nreductive and deterministic character of the New Left\u2019s analyses of\nsport. Hegemony theorists such as Richard Gruenau (1983) and John\nHargreaves (1986) explore the role that cultural practices and\nprocesses play in shaping the nature of sporting practices, while\nemphasizing the value of human agency. \n\n\nExternalist accounts of sport tend to be regarded as deflationary\nbecause they deny, or overlook, that sport has independent value. They\nunderstand sport\u2019s value solely in instrumental terms (Ryall,\n2016). Internalist theories of sport do not analyse sport based on\nother social practices or historical processes. Rather, they aim to\nidentify the distinctive values and purposes of sport that\ndifferentiate it from other social practices. Proponents of internalism\nacknowledge the influence on sport of other practices and the larger\nsociety, but internalists argue that sport is a practice with its own\ndistinctive value and internal logic. Thus, the primary goal of\ninternalism is to uncover the intrinsic normative principles of sport.\nA central task within the philosophy of sport has been to develop an\nadequate internalist normative theory of sport. At a minimum, such a\ntheory should articulate sport\u2019s non-instrumental value and it\nshould provide guidance on appropriate standards of both conduct within\nsport, and sporting rules and practices themselves. Internalist views\nare typically classified into the following three categories:\nformalism, conventionalism, and broad internalism (or interpretivism).\nWe examine each in turn now.\n2.1 Formalism\n\n\nFormalism conceives of sport as constituted solely by written rules:\na sport is just the set of written rules that govern it. On this view,\nthere is no need to look beyond the written rules to determine whether\nan activity is a sport (e.g. is tennis a sport?), whether an activity\nconstitutes the playing of a certain sport (e.g. are they playing\ntennis or squash?), or whether a particular move is permitted within a\nspecific sport (e.g. is kicking the ball permitted in tennis?).\n\n\nBernard Suits\u2019 The Grasshopper: Games, Life and\nUtopia (1978 [2014]) is regarded as the seminal formalist text\n(Hurka, \n 2005)[1].\n Suits attempts to refute Wittgenstein\u2019s claim that, as a\n\u2018family-resemblance\u2019 concept, \u2018game\u2019 resists\ndefinition. On Wittgenstein\u2019s view (1958, sect. 66\u201367), it\nis not possible to specify individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient conditions for something to constitute a game. Instead,\ngames are endlessly varied, and, while some games may share features\nin common with some other games, there is no single element that is\nshared by all games. Contra Wittgenstein, Suits argues that there are\nfour elements common to every game: goals, means, rules, and a certain\nattitude among the gameplayers.\n\n\nGames are goal-directed activities. Every game has two distinct\ngoals: a \u2018lusory\u2019 goal and a \u2018pre-lusory\u2019 goal.\nThe pre-lusory goal is a specific state of affairs that game players\ntry to bring about: placing the ball in the hole in golf, crossing the\nbar in the high jump, and crossing the line in the marathon. These can\nbe achieved prior to the formation of a game. For example, I can place\na golf ball in a hole even if no game of golf has begun, or I can jump\nover a bar even if no high jump competition is underway. The lusory\ngoal is winning. This can be achieved only in the context of an\norganised game.\n\n\nThe second element of any game is the means. Every game restricts\nthe methods that gameplayers are permitted to use to achieve the\npre-lusory goal. Golfers are not allowed to drop the ball into the hole\nwith their hands; high jumpers are not permitted to vault the bar using\na trampoline, and marathon runners are forbidden from completing the\nrace using a bicycle. The means permitted in games are always\n\u2018inefficient\u2019 for the achievement of the pre-lusory goal.\nFor example, if the goal of boxing is to incapacitate one\u2019s\nopponent for a count of \u201810\u2019, it would be much more\nefficient to attack her with a baseball bat or to shoot her with a gun\nthan having to punch her above the waist wearing gloves. If the\ngoal of soccer is to put the ball into the goal, it would be much more\nefficient to kick, head, and carry the ball rather than only kicking\nand heading it. Means permitted within a game are the\n\u2018lusory\u2019 means, and those prohibited are the\n\u2018illusory\u2019 means.\n\n\nThe third element of a game is the (constitutive) rules. Rules\nprovide a complete account of what means are permitted and not\npermitted within the game. They establish what means can be employed to\nachieve the pre-lusory goal of the game. These limitations on the\npermitted means make the game possible, for they erect (unnecessary)\nobstacles that participants attempt to overcome in the game. For\ninstance, boxing rules disallow the use of weapons, such as knives or\nfirearms. This ensures that the sport is a punching contest. The laws\nof soccer permit the use of any body part other than the arms so that\nthe ball is played predominantly with the feet. In addition to\nconstitutive rules, Suits argues, there are rules of skill, which\nestablish how to play the game well. Such rules are rules of\nthumb that a coach may advise a player to follow to help her better\nexecute the skills of the sport (e.g. keep your eye on the ball, follow\nthrough after impact, accelerate through the finish line).\n\n\nThe final element of gameplaying is attitudinal. Suits argues that,\nto play a game, one must have the \u2018lusory attitude\u2019.\nPlayers must commit themselves to playing in accordance with the rules\nthat constitute the game just so that the game can take place. The type\nof motivation must be a particular kind (or at least must\ninclude motivation of a particular kind): players must respect\nthe rules because they wish to play and they endorse the formalist view\nthat breaking the rules necessarily ends the game. It is not sufficient\nto be motivated to respect the rules, for example, to ensure\none\u2019s good reputation or to compete for a\n\u2018sportsmanship\u2019 award. So, in the absence of the lusory\nattitude, it is quite possible, according to Suits, for a player to act\nin accordance with the rules without actually playing the game. The\nplayers accept the constitutive rules because, in the absence of such\nacceptance, no game is possible. On this view, if someone decided that\nshe would break the rules whenever she could do so undetected, then,\naccording to Suits, she is not really playing the game \u2013 even if\nno opportunity to break the rules undetected ever arose. She might\nappear to be playing the game, but, in the absence of an\nacceptance to bind herself to the constraints imposed by the\nconstitutive rules, she would not count as really playing the\ngame. \n\n\nThe four elements in Suits\u2019 analysis of games culminate in the\nfollowing definition:\n\nTo play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs,\nusing only means permitted by the rules, where the rules prohibit use\nof more efficient in favour of less efficient means, and where the\nrules are accepted just because they make possible such activity.\n(Suits, 1978 [2014, 43])\n\n\nSuits also offers a shorthand definition: \u2018playing a game is\nthe voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles\u2019 (Suits,\n1978 [2014, 43]). Suits\u2019 account of games has attracted much critical\nattention. Principal among the objections raised are that games are not\nconstituted by their constitutive rules only (D\u2019Agostino, 1981;\nRussell, 1999) and that gameplaying does not require strict adherence\nto constitutive rules (i.e. some rule-breaking can be consistent with\ngame-playing) (Lehman, 1981; Fraleigh, 2003).\n\n\nSuits draws on his definition of games to provide a definition of\nsport. He defines sports as \u2018games of physical skill\u2019\n(Suits, 1988, 2), incorporating the elements of his earlier\ndefinition of game and adding further elements that are distinctive to\nsport as compared to other types of games. In particular, a game\nbecomes a sport by meeting the following criteria: \u2018(1) that the\ngame be a game of skill; (2) that the skill be physical; (3) that the\ngame has a wide following; and (4) that the following achieve a\ncertain level of stability\u2019 (Suits, 1973 [2007]). Thus, the\noutcome of the game must be dependent on the exercise of physical\nskills. This is what differentiates sporting games from card games or\nchess, for example (see Kobiela, 2018 and Hale, 2008). In the latter,\nthe way the body is moved is irrelevant, and what matters are the\nmoves made (either with cards or pieces on the board). Indeed, such\ngames can be played in non-physical spaces such as virtual reality and\nby non-human players such as computers. However, in soccer or boxing,\nthe skillful control of the body is essential to the achievement of\nthe goal of the game.\n\n\nThe third and fourth criteria in Suits\u2019 definition demand that\nsports are widely followed institutionalized games. A sport is\ninstitutionalized when its norms and codified rules are established and\nenforced by formal associations or organizations. The\ninstitutionalization criterion is often employed in sociological and\nhistorical analyses of sport. For example, historian Allen Guttmann\n(1978) argues that bureaucratization and rationalization are defining\ncomponents of modern sports. Sport philosophers, however, have remained\nskeptical about the possibility of defining sports as institutionalized\ngames. For instance, Klaus V. Meier (1988) rejects the\ninstitutionalization criterion. For him, the institutionalization\naspect is not a defining element of sport, but rather a contingent one\nthat \u2018adds color and significance to particular sports\u2019\n(Meier, 1988, 15). In his view, should soccer lack international\nfollowing and institutions to establish and enforce the rules of the\ngame, it would still be a sport. \n\n\nIn \u2018Tricky Triad,\u2019 Suits revises his original definition\nof sport from \u2018The Elements of Sport\u2019, redefining sports\nas\n\n\u2026 competitive events involving a variety of physical (usually\nin combination with other) human skills, where the superior\nparticipant is judged to have exhibited those skills in a superior\nway. (Suits, 1988: 2)\n\n\nIn this definition, Suits narrows the scope of the concept of\n\u2018game\u2019 and distinguishes between two types of sports:\n\u2018refereed games\u2019 and \u2018judged performances.\u2019\nThat is to say, whereas in his earlier definition all sports\nare games, in his revised definition only some sports are\ngames, other sports are performances. Soccer, basketball, tennis, and\nAmerican football are games, while gymnastics, figure skating, and\ndiving are performances. The key difference between the two, according\nto Suits, is that games have constitutive rules, whereas performances\nlack constitutive rules and have only rules of skill. Thus, for Suits,\ngames consist in overcoming obstacles erected by the constitutive\nrules, whereas performances centre on the approximation of an ideal or\nperfect performance. For example, soccer players play the ball with\ntheir feet cooperatively as a team to put the ball into the opponent\u2019s\nnet. Using the feet, working as a team, and facing an opponent are the\nobstacles erected by the rules of soccer. For Suits, there is nothing\nlike these in performances. Figure skaters do not attempt to overcome\nobstacles. Rather, they try to approach an ideal performance that\nmanifests virtues such as power, grace, and imagination. \n\n\nThis revised definition sparked a classic debate in the philosophy\nof sport between Suits and Meier. The latter criticized Suits\u2019 revised\ndefinition of sport and defended the original one. For Meier (1988),\nSuits\u2019 original definition is correct because what Suits calls\n\u2018performances\u2019 also have constitutive rules. For example,\ngymnasts perform their acrobatics in a specific space, utilising\ncertain equipment. Kretchmar agrees with Meier that both types of\nsports are games, but acknowledges that performances place more\nemphasis on aesthetic criteria, calling them \u2018beautiful\ngames\u2019 (Kretchmar, 1989). Despite criticism, Suits\u2019 definitions\nof games and sport serve as the point of departure for most\ncontemporary philosophical theorising about sport, thereby making Suits\nthe most influential figure in the discipline.\n\n\nTurning to formalism more generally, adherents of this view take\nrules to be the normative cornerstone of a proper ethical analysis of\nsport. They define the rightness and wrongness of conduct within sport\nsolely in terms of rule-following. Strict formalists contend that one\ncannot play the game and break the rules at the same time (i.e. the\n\u2018logical incompatibility thesis\u2019). If gameplaying requires\nadherence to the rules, then any rule violation \u2013 intentional or\notherwise \u2013 marks an end to the game. Formalists oppose strategic\nfouling and doping because both practices involve breaking the rules\n(Moore, 2017a; Morgan, 1987; P\u00e9rez Trivi\u00f1o, 2014).\n\n\nFormalist analyses of sport hold important similarities to debates\nwithin the philosophy of law about the nature of law. Indeed, the works\nof philosophers of law such as Ronald Dworkin and H. L. A. Hart, as\nwell as philosophical analyses of rules such as those of Immanuel Kant\nand John R. Searle, have been influential within formalism (Kretchmar,\n2001; Torres, 2000).\n\n\nFormalism has been criticised as an inadequate normative theory of\nsport on account of its failure to recognise non-rule based norms in\nsport. As formalists do not recognise normative reasons internal to\nsport other than the rules themselves, they lack criteria to evaluate\nexisting or proposed rules as well as criteria to evaluate actions not\ncontemplated in the rulebook. Kretchmar attempts to salvage formalism\nfrom this criticism by drawing on both Suits and Searle. In Kretchmar\u2019s\nview, critics of formalism overlook the fact that games and, a\nfortiori, constitutive rules are created to serve a function: to\nprovide engaging, artificial problems. Games are made by humans for\nhumans. Human biological nature is, in Searle\u2019s terms, a \u2018brute fact\u2019\nthat gamewrights consider when creating the rules. They craft games\nthat fit human capacities to present a \u2018just right\u2019 challenge\n(Kretchmar, 2015a). Otherwise, games would fail to perform their\nfunction. Kretchmar argues that Suits\u2019 account already contains\nthe resources necessary to discharge this evaluative function of an\nadequate normative theory of sport. Suits argues that when games set an\nextremely difficult or extremely easy obstacle, individuals lose\ninterest in playing them (Kretchmar, 1975). Such games, then, fail to\nfulfil their goal of providing players with a worthy set of obstacles\nto overcome.\n\n\nAnother criticism that has been levelled against formalism is the\napparently implausible implication of the logical incompatibility\nthesis that any game in which a rule is broken ends at the point at\nwhich the rule-breaking occurs. If rule-breaking is incompatible with\ngameplaying then any foul or accidental transgression of the rules\nwould cause the game to end. For instance, a 100m sprint would cease\nwhen a runner makes a false start. A basketball game would terminate\nwhen a player commits a strategic foul to prevent an opponent from\nscoring in a fast break. A tennis match would end whenever a shot is\nhit out. Formalists have attempted to overcome this objection by\ndistinguishing between \u2018constitutive rules\u2019 and\n\u2018regulative rules\u2019. The latter allow the game to be\nreinstated following a transgression of the rules by determining how\nthe game is to be restarted (e.g. restarting the race, a free kick, a\nsecond serve) and how rule-breakers are to be penalized (e.g.\ndisqualified from the race, a penalty kick awarded to the opposing\nteam, the loss of a point). For Graham McFee (2004b), this constitutive\nrule/regulative rule distinction does not address the objection\nadequately, as it remains unclear when a rule is constitutive or\nregulative. For instance, an outfield player in soccer using her hands\nto stop a counterattack would be considered a strategic foul and,\ntherefore, judged according to a regulative rule. However, if players\nconstantly used their hands, the game would become either impossible\n(e.g. all players are eventually sent off) or a different game (e.g.\nrugby or handball). Thus, according to McFee, rules must be understood\nbased on how participants use them in specific contexts. However,\nformalism does not provide the resources to make these contextual\ndiscriminations. What criteria should we use to evaluate the rules of a\nsport? When should we change the rules of a sport? Can we evaluate a\npurported need for rule change without appealing to some consideration\nother than the rules themselves? \n2.2 Conventionalism\n\n\nConventionalism attempts to address the limitations of formalism by\nrecognizing the normative significance of unwritten rules of the game.\nFor conventionalists, rules do not exhaust the sources of normative\nreasons within sport. Conventionalists argue that rules (whether\nconstitutive or regulative) cannot determine their own application and\nthey fail to provide guidance for all possible eventualities in a game\n(e.g. situations that were not envisioned by the rule makers). In\naddition, a strictly rule-centric approach fails to account for the\nexistence of unwritten norms that supplement the rules. Such norms\nexist independent of, and sometimes in conflict with, the formal\nrules.\n\n\nConventionalists argue that an adequate account of sport must appeal\nto collectively agreed-upon norms called \u2018conventions.\u2019\nFred D\u2019Agostino, the pioneer of conventionalism, maintains that the\nconventions that operate within a game constitute the\n\u2018ethos\u2019 of the game. The ethos of a game is the \u2018set\nof unofficial, implicit conventions which determine how the rules of a\ngame are to be applied in concrete circumstances\u2019\n(D\u2019Agostino, 1981, 15). Thus, from a conventionalist perspective,\nsports comprise both formal rules and conventions. For example, in\nsoccer, convention dictates that the ball must be put out of play when\nany player requires medical attention. No written rule demands that\nplayers kick the ball out of play in such circumstances. However, any\nplayer who failed to do so would be subject to blame and rebuke.\nConventionalism is better equipped than formalism to describe and\nunderstand how sports are actually practiced in specific contexts. For\ninstance, despite playing the same game, amateur soccer players in a\npick-up game and professional players in the World Cup final apply the\nrulebook differently (e.g. amateurs often suspend the offside rule,\nwhereas the rule is crucial at the professional level). Likewise, the\nnon-contact and travelling rules in basketball are applied differently\ndepending on the context.\n\n\nCritics acknowledge that conventionalism is a fruitful descriptive\ntheory of sport, but point out that its normative implications are\nproblematic (Ciomaga, 2013). For instance, much as formalism lacks the\nresources to distinguish good from bad rules, it has been objected that\nconventionalism too lacks \u2018critical edge,\u2019 for it fails to\nprovide the resources necessary to distinguish good from bad\nconventions (Simon et al., 2015). That a convention in fact operates in\na sport does not settle the question of whether it should operate. In\nshort, conventionalists seem to take the status quo as normative. An\nimplication of conventionalism would seem to be, then, that manifestly\nobjectionable conventions (e.g. \u2018never pass the ball to a black\nperson\u2019 or \u2018spit at members of the opposing team whenever\npossible\u2019) could be normative on a conventionalist scheme.\n\n\nDrawing on David Lewis\u2019 and Andrei Marmor\u2019s work on conventions,\nconventionalists have attempted to address this objection by\ndistinguishing \u2018deep\u2019 from \u2018surface\u2019\nconventions (Morgan, 2012). This view is called \u2018deep\nconventionalism\u2019. Surface conventions are what Lewis called\n\u2018coordinating\u2019 conventions. Their main function is to help individuals\nto resolve recurrent, collective problems. For instance, Morgan argues\nthat, when participating in a game, players may encounter situations\nthat require collective decisionmaking related to the application of a\nspecific rule or an event that disrupts the flow of the game. To solve\nthese problems, participants harmonize their action by agreeing to\nuphold the same unwritten rules.\n\n\nDeep conventions do not relate to problem solving and coordination.\nRather, they are \u2018normative responses to deep psychological and social\nneeds for playing sports\u2019 (Morgan, 2015, 39). Put differently, deep\nconventions shape sports into the various historical and social forms\nthey have taken. For instance, the principles and ideals underlying the\namateur view of sport, according to which participants engage in the\ngame chiefly for the love of it, are deep conventions. Thus, a\nsport\u2019s deep conventions determine the point of that sport and\nprovide a rationale for playing the sport in a specific way by\nestablishing what counts as normatively intelligible and justifiable\nwithin that sport. For example, amateur athletes often view sport as a\nperfective enterprise pursued for its own sake. They play sport for the\nlove of the game not for instrumental benefit. The amateur\u2019s\nemphasis on the intrinsic value of sport contrasts with the\nprofessional\u2019s view of sport. For professionals, sport tends to\nbe viewed as a serious, instrumental occupation, that is, a means to\nearn a living (Morgan, 2015, 40\u201341). Thus, amateurs and professionals\nevaluate differently practices such as training, doping, and\nstrategising. While professionals embrace conduct that increases their\nchance of victory, amateurs are often more discerning, rejecting\npractices such as professional coaches and strategic fouling on the\ngrounds that they are detrimental to the emphasis of the appreciation\nof the practice itself, not the instrumental goals achieved through it.\n \n\n\nIn response to critics of conventionalism, Morgan has argued that\ndeep conventions provide evaluative criteria by which the moral\nstanding of surface conventions can be assessed. However, it remains\nunclear whether Morgan responds satisfactorily to criticisms that have\nbeen leveled against deep conventionalism (Moore, 2018). How can deep\nconventions be distinguished from surface conventions? Does deep\nconventionalism only shift the \u2018critical edge\u2019 problem to\nthe deep convention level? What resources does deep conventionalism\nprovide to evaluate deep conventions? \n2.3 Broad Internalism (Interpretivism)\n\n\nIn contrast both to formalists who see sport as constituted by rules\nonly and conventionalists for whom sport is constituted by rules and\nconventions, broad internalists maintain that sport is constituted by\nrules, conventions, as well as underlying intrinsic principles\n(Russell, 1999; Simon et al., 2015). According to Robert L. Simon, one\nof the pioneers of this view, \u2018broad internalism claims that in\naddition to the rules of various sports, there are underlying\nprinciples that might be embedded in overall theories or accounts of\nsport as a practice\u2019 (Simon, 2000, 7). Intrinsic principles are key for\nbroad internalists, as they provide the foundation for interpreting or\nunderstanding sport practices. Such principles are \u2018presuppositions of\nsporting practice in the sense that they must be accepted if our\nsporting practice is to make sense or, perhaps, make the best sense\u2019\n(Simon et al., 2015, 32). Formalists and conventionalists fail to give\ndue recognition to the idea that rules and conventions must be\ninterpreted and applied so as to respect and promote normative\nprinciples that determine the point of the practice.\n\n\nRonald Dworkin\u2019s interpretivist theory of law holds that law must be\ninterpreted in accordance with principles (e.g. justice) without which\nlegal practice would not make sense. Interpretivism heavily influenced\nSimon\u2019s formulation of broad internalism. This is perhaps unsurprising\nas several broad internalists consider sport to constitute a type of\nlegal system with its own jurisprudence (e.g. Russell. 2015). On\nSimon\u2019s view, sport is interpreted by appealing to intrinsic\nprinciples, separate to rules and conventions, that define the logic of\nthe practice. Justice and competitive excellence are examples of such\nprinciples. Without them, Simon\u2019s argument continues, the sporting\npractice would not make sense. Drawing on different understandings of\nthe intrinsic principles that underlie sport, three broad internalist\napproaches have been formulated: contractualism, the \u2018respect for\nthe integrity of the game\u2019 account, and mutualism.\n\n\nThe contractualist approach holds that sports are made possible by\nan implicit social contract among participants. Agreement to partake in\nthe practice and abide by a specific set of rules and conventions\nprovides normative validity to the rules and conventions upheld during\nthe game. For instance, Warren P. Fraleigh argues that sports are made\npossible not only by the rules, but also by the fact that players agree\nto follow them (Fraleigh, 1984). Inaugural events prior to sporting\nevents symbolize such an implicit pact. In the Olympic Games, for\nexample, countries parade with their respective national flags during\nthe opening ceremony and, as in the Ancient Olympic Games (Miller,\n2006), competitors swear an oath, agreeing to abide by the rules and\nthe spirit of fair play.\n\n\nThe \u2018respect for the integrity of the game\u2019 approach was\nproposed by Robert Butcher and Angela Schneider (Butcher and Schneider,\n1998). It focuses on identifying a game\u2019s interest, that is, the\ninterests of the game itself separate to the interest of players. These\ninterests, so the argument goes, must be respected by all involved. The\ngame is regarded as an intrinsically valuable entity which demands\nrespect. To flesh out the idea that a game itself may have interests,\nButcher and Schneider draw upon Kretchmar\u2019s theory of sport as a\ncontest aimed at comparing the participants\u2019 performances and Alasdair\nMacIntyre\u2019s notion of \u2018social practice.\u2019 Combining these\nviews, Butcher and Schneider argue that a game is an activity in which\nparticipants test each other both to discover who is superior in that\nsport and to achieve certain goods and excellences internal to the\npractice. These goods and excellences are connected to the distinctive\nnature of sport and the participants\u2019 experiences while engaged\nin them. For instance, the ability to kick a ball skillfully \u2013 to\nmake a beautiful pass \u2013 is an intrinsic good of soccer.\n\n\nThe foundation of the mutualist view is the understanding of\nsporting competition as a \u2018mutually acceptable quest for excellence\nthrough challenge\u2019 (Simon et al., 2015: 47). Robert L. Simon, Cesar R.\nTorres, and Peter F. Hager have provided the most detailed account of\nthis approach. They argue that mutualism is the philosophical theory\nthat best conceives sport.\n\n\nJohn S. Russell provides a similar account of sport, whereby\n\n\u2026 rules should be interpreted in such a manner that the excellences\nembodied in achieving the lusory goal of the game are not undermined\nbut are maintained and fostered. (Russell, 1999, 35)\n\n\nFor Russell, as for Simon, broad internalism \u2018generate[s] a coherent\nand principled account of the point and purposes that underlie the\ngame, attempting to show the game in its best light\u2019 (Russell, 1999,\n35).\n\n\nBy way of illustration, Russell (1999) recounts a baseball match\nfrom 1887 between Louisville and Brooklyn in which a Louisville player,\nReddy Mack, who had just crossed home plate interfered with a Brooklyn\ncatcher, preventing him from tagging another Louisville runner. While\nthe interference was ongoing, another Louisville player crossed home\nplate. Crucially, at the time of the game, the rules prohibited only\nbase runners from interfering with fielders. However, when Mack\ninterfered with the Brooklyn fielder, he was no longer a runner,\nbecause he had crossed the home plate. So, the rules did not explicitly\nprohibit Mack from interfering with the fielder. If the umpire followed\nthe rules strictly, then Mack\u2019s interference should have been\nallowed, and the runner who followed Mack to home plate should not have\nbeen ruled out. However, as Russell notes, following the rules in this\nway would have invited further interference of fielders by non-base\nrunners, so the game would likely have descended into a\n\u2018nine-inning-long wrestling match\u2019 (Russell, 1999: 28). To\nprevent such an outcome, the umpire read into existence a rule that\nprohibited non-base runners from interfering with fielders. So, he\ncalled out the runner who made it to home plate following Mack. This\nexercise of discretion was not subsequently overturned, and it\nprecipitated a rule change to prohibit non-base runners from\ninterfering with fielders. Indeed, it seemed necessary to depart from\nthe rules to protect the nature of the sport. The umpire might be\nunderstood to have considered the purpose of the sport in deciding how\nhe should rule on this incident. Baseball is a sport that tests\nexcellence in running, batting, throwing and catching \u2013 but not\nwrestling. The umpire interpreted (and amended) the rules in light of\nthe sport\u2019s underlying purpose. In short, the umpire had to\nappeal to principles that underlie the rules and conventions to decide\nhow the rules should be applied, and, in this case, to read a rule into\nexistence. In inventing a rule to govern this situation which the\nrulemakers had likely never countenanced, the umpire protected the\nintegrity of the game. For broad internalists, this example\ndemonstrates the necessity of appeal to principles that precede the\nrules and conventions. \n\n\nBroad internalist accounts closely connect sport to the pursuit of\nexcellence, as they typically view the fundamental purpose of sporting\ncompetition to be the display of sporting excellence. The connection\nbetween competition and excellence allows mutualist philosophers to\ndevelop a critical-pedagogical view of sport\u2019s competitive\nnature. This view challenges the strong emphasis placed on victory at\nthe elite level. For Simon, when victory is overemphasized, sports are\nseen as \u2018zero-sum\u2019 games (Simon, 2014), that is, games where only the\nvictor can benefit from participation. \n\n\nOn the mutualist view, sports are \u2018non-zero-sum\u2019 games. All players\ncan benefit from participation, even those who lose. Through\ncompetition, players push each other to perform and improve. While only\none player or team can win, all can benefit from competing, as\ncompetition can provide an avenue to more fully perfect one\u2019s\nabilities. When sport is at its best, competitors struggle\ncooperatively for excellence. On this view, the intrinsic principles of\nsport do not revolve around the pursuit of victory, but the cultivation\nof excellence. Drawing on MacIntyre, mutualist philosophers argue that\nthe goods more directly connected to victory are external to the\npractice, whereas those linked to excellence are internal (McFee,\n2004a). Mutualism is an Aristotelian-inspired teleological account of\nsport, whereby the purpose of sport is understood to be the promotion\nof human flourishing. This view of sport resonates with that of the\nOlympic Movement and its founder Pierre de Coubertin (Loland,\n1995).\n\n\nBroad internalism has been criticised on three principal grounds:\nfor failing to adequately acknowledge the importance of history to a\nproper normative account of sport; for its reliance on interpretive\nprinciples that are too vague to provide any practical guidance to\ndecisionmaking in sport (Morgan, 2016); and for delivering an\nincomplete account of sport (Kretchmar, 2015b; Nguyen, 2017). Drawing\non Thomas Nagel, Morgan argues that broad internalism provides a \u2018view\nfrom nowhere\u2019 notion of sport that fails to acknowledge the historical\nand social situatedness of sporting practices (Morgan, 2012). Kretchmar\ncontends that broad internalism provides a restrictive view of sport\nbuilt upon the value of work and excellence (Kretchmar, 2016). On this\nview, we should be pluralists, not monists, about the intrinsic value\nof sport. Excellence captures some of sport\u2019s intrinsic value,\nbut it is only a partial account. Paraphrasing Russell, mutualism shows\nsport in only one of its best lights. \n3. Topics in the Philosophy of Sport\n\n\nIn this section, we explore the central philosophical problems that\narise in sport and how they have been addressed in the literature. In\nparticular, we chart the landscape of the following seven leading\nethical problems: (a) sportsmanship; (b) cheating; (c)\nperformance-enhancement; (d) dangerous and violent sport; (e)\nsex, gender, and race; (f) fans and spectators; (g) disability sport;\nand (h) sport aesthetics.\n3.1 Sportsmanship\n\n\nSportsmanship is the quintessential sporting virtue. It has also\nbeen thought important to civic and cultural life beyond sport (Sabl,\n2008). Nevertheless, the concept has received little philosophical\nattention. The literature on sportsmanship converges on the view that\nthis virtue requires more than mere compliance with formal rules.\nHowever, there are two principal disputes in the literature: whether\nsportsmanship is a virtue at all levels of sport or just at the\nrecreational level and whether sportsmanship is a unified concept or a\ncluster of distinct virtues.\n\n\nThe traditional point of departure in the sportsmanship debate is\nJames W. Keating\u2019s \u2018Is Sportsmanship a Moral\nCategory?\u2019 (1965). On this account, there is a moral distinction\nbetween \u2018sport\u2019 (recreational sport) and\n\u2018athletics\u2019 (competitive sport). Standards of ethics\nappropriate to sport at the recreational level are not equivalent to\nthose appropriate at the competitive level. Indeed, conduct appropriate\nto the recreational sport may be morally objectionable at the\ncompetitive level and vice versa. This moral discontinuity between\nrecreational and competitive sport extends to sportsmanship.\nSpecifically, as the goal of recreational sport is \u2018pleasant\ndiversion\u2019, the essence of sportsmanship in that context is\n\u2018generosity\u2019 (Keating, 1965, 34). This requires the\nparticipant always to try to increase the enjoyability of the activity\nboth for themselves and for other participants. In athletics, where the\noverriding goal is \u2018honorable victory\u2019, sportsmanship\nrequires \u2018fairness\u2019. The type of fairness in question is\nformal fairness \u2013 \u2018equality before the law\u2019 (Keating,\n1965, 34). An equal and impartial application of the rules, as dictated\nby formal fairness, purportedly helps to ensure that competition\nfulfills its purpose as a test of athletic excellence and that victory\ncorrectly tracks athletic superiority (Keating, 1965, 34). \n\n\nKeating\u2019s distinction between sport and athletics has been\ncontested. Simon et al. (2015) have suggested that this distinction is\ntoo sharp. A given contest can contain elements of both sport and\nathletics. Moreover, sportsmanship requires more than, as Keating\nsuggests, generosity to opponents or fidelity to the rules. Not only\ndoes sportsmanship require respect for the principles that underpin\nmorally defensible competition, it also requires positive action to\nprotect and promote these principles. Randolph Feezell (1986) offers an\nunderstanding of sportsmanship that seems to combine both, as\nsportsmanship is understood as the mean between excessive seriousness\nand excessive playfulness in sport.\n\n\nDiana Abad (2010) argues that sportsmanship should not, as typically\nassumed, be treated as a unified concept. Instead, sportsmanship is\nconstituted by four irreducible elements: fairness, equity, good form\nor honour, and the will to win. These elements are not only\nanalytically distinct but also potentially incompatible. However, she\nargues that such conflict between these values can be resolved by\nstriking an appropriate \u2018balance\u2019 between the conflicting\nelements.\n3.2 Cheating\n\n\nIn contrast to sportsmanship, cheating represents, at least prima\nfacie, the chief form of moral failure in sport.\n\n\nCheating has proved to be a notoriously difficult concept to define.\nA commonsense understanding of cheating as the \u2018intentional\nviolation of the rules to gain a competitive advantage\u2019 is\nreplete with difficulties (Green, 2006; Russell, 2017). For example, if\ncheating is necessarily a type of rule violation, what of the\nviolation of conventions and other norms not captured by the formal\nrules? If cheating must be aimed at the attainment of competitive\nadvantage, what of intentional rule-breaking that aims to rectify an\nearlier injustice (e.g. cheating or refereeing error) that advantaged\none\u2019s opponent?\n\n\nLeaving aside definitional issues and turning to the moral status of\ncheating, moral objections to cheating typically rest on two principal\narguments. The first invokes the logical incompatibility thesis \u2013\nthe idea that rule-breaking is not compatible with game playing,\nbecause game playing requires strict adherence to the rules (see sect.\n2.1). This argument could justify a prohibition of only forms of\ncheating that involve rule-breaking: it could not ground an\nobjection to cheating that involves the violation of conventions or\nbroad internalist principles. The second argument relies on the idea\nthat cheating is an attempt to gain an unfair advantage, that is, an\nadvantage not permitted under the agreement between players or the set\nof norms by which players are expected to abide (Gert, 2004).\nFairness-based objections may not ground a prohibition to\n\u2018retaliatory\u2019 or \u2018compensatory\u2019 cheating that\nis undertaken to re-establish fairness following an injustice that has\nplaced a competitor at an unfair disadvantage (Kirkwood, 2012).\n\n\nThe moral impermissibility of cheating has been challenged from\nseveral directions. The case of cyclist Lance Armstrong has provided a\nfocal point for some of this debate (Moore, 2017b; Pike and Cordell,\nforthcoming): is cheating wrong if one\u2019s competitors (or at least a\nsignificant proportion of one\u2019s competitors) are also cheating?\nThat is, does one\u2019s duty not to cheat cease if one\u2019s\ncompetitors do not discharge their duty not to cheat? Here the problem\nof ethics in non-ideal theory (i.e. acting in conditions of only\npartial compliance with justice) arises in sport.\n\n\nOliver Leaman has argued that cheating can become part of the skill\nand strategy of a game, thereby adding to the game\u2019s excitement\nand interest for both players and spectators. If cheating is accepted\nas part of the game such that all competitors recognize cheating as an\noption (whether or not they avail of that option), then concerns over\nequality and justice do not arise (Leaman, 1981) In these\ncircumstances, according to Leaman, cheating would be morally\npermissible.\n\n\nHugh Upton (2011) has gone further to suggest not only that cheating\nmay be morally permissible in certain circumstances but that\none may be morally required to cheat. This moral requirement\narises specifically in team sports where, from a duty of loyalty, a\nplayer may owe her teammates maximum effort to win the game subject\nonly to the requirements of fair play that are routinely observed in\nthe sport. To observe standards of fair play that are not usually\nobserved in the sport may be \u2018self-indulgent\u2019,\ndemonstrating an undue concern for one\u2019s own ethical propriety at\nthe expense of one\u2019s teammates. On this view, the duty not to let down\none\u2019s teammates may imply a duty to cheat.\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting the related discussion of\n\u2018gamesmanship\u2019. This is a term used to denote conduct that\nfalls short of cheating (as it does not violate the formal rules) but\nis morally dubious nonetheless. Such acts might include the\nintimidation of one\u2019s opponent, the manipulation of officials, or\nthe intentional disruption of an opponent\u2019s preparations (e.g.\ncoughing just as she is about to putt). Gamesmanship may add a test of\none\u2019s psychological robustness to the sporting contest, but this\nmay diminish the contest as a test of athletic excellence (Howe, 2004).\nWhile such conduct is not formally proscribed, it speaks to a question\nthat every athlete must ponder: what should I be prepared to do to\nwin?\n3.3 Performance Enhancement\n\n\nAthletes have attempted to improve their performances by deploying a\nvariety of different performance enhancers, ranging from pharmaceutical\nsubstances (e.g. anabolic steroids) to equipment (e.g. full-body 100%\npolyurethane swimsuits), with genetic manipulation seemingly just\naround the corner. Which, if any, performance-enhancing methods should\nbe allowed in sport? Is there any good reason to restrict their use, or\nshould athletes be free to use whatever methods they choose? This\ndebate cuts to the very heart of questions regarding the purpose of\nsporting competition and what counts as excellent athletic performance\n(M\u00f8ller, Hoberman, and Waddington, 2015).\n\n\nThe most widely discussed form of enhancement is the use of performance-enhancing drugs (i.e. \u2018doping\u2019). There are three sides in the doping debate: \u2018pro-doping\u2019, \u2018anti-doping\u2019, and \u2018anti-anti-doping\u2019 (McNamee\n2008; Murray 2016: 128\u2013133). Those who regard doping as a morally\nacceptable practice that should not be banned from sport are\npro-doping. For them, the use of performance-enhancing methods or\nsubstances is justified because it aligns with the idea that a central purpose of sport is to\nstrive to be better or, more broadly, it aligns with a natural human impulse to\ncreate tools to achieve our goals (Brown, 1980, 1984; M\u00f8ller,\n2009; Savulescu, Foddy, and Clayton, 2004). For instance, Savulescu et\nal. argue: \u2018Far from being against the spirit of sport,\nbiological manipulation embodies the human spirit \u2013 the capacity to\nimprove ourselves on the basis of reason and judgment\u2019 (Savulescu\net al., 2004, 667). Pro-doping arguments typically rely on the claim\nthat doping is morally equivalent to the use of other sports technology\nor medical interventions that are widely accepted in sport (e.g.\ncushioned running shoes, graphite tennis rackets, or Lasik eye\nsurgery). If we are willing to allow their use, so the argument goes,\nthen it would be irrational to preclude the use of\nperformance-enhancing substances (Murray, 2018).\n\n\nThe anti-doping side argue that restriction on the use of\nperformance-enhancing methods is justifiable. They typically appeal to\nany of the following arguments: (a) performance enhancement runs\ncounter to the intrinsic nature of sport by undermining its central\npurpose \u2013 the cultivation and display of sporting excellence\n(Devine, 2011; Sandel, 2007); (b) performance enhancement compromises\nthe fairness of competition by providing its users with an unfair\nadvantage (Douglas, 2007; Loland, 2002); (c) performance enhancement\nexerts a negative and dangerous influence on society, especially young people, by spreading acceptance of drug use (Pound, 2006); (d)\nperformance enhancement is intrinsically immoral as it is the\nexpression of a morally corrupt character or violates a moral value\n(e.g. authenticity or naturalness) (Bonte and Tolleneer, 2013;\nHabermas, 2003; Sandel, 2009); and (e) performance enhancement is\nharmful to participants (H\u00f8lm, 2007; Kayser and Broers,\n2015; Savulescu, 2015).\n\nFinally, proponents of the anti-anti-doping view object morally to the\npractical implications of anti-doping regulations (especially with\nregard to policing the use of performance enhancing drugs). On this\nview, a ban on performance-enhancing drugs should not be imposed, even\nif justifiable in principle, because the implementation of such a ban\nwould necessarily involve morally objectionable practices.\nAnti-anti-doping arguments criticise the fight against doping on the\ngrounds that it costs too much (in both economic and moral terms) and\nsecures insufficient benefit in terms of the promotion of compliance\nand the identification of non-compliance with anti-doping rules (Kayser\net al., 2005, 2007). Advocates of this view may endorse principled\nobjections to doping but believe that the institutional requirements\nfor policing such a ban are not morally justifiable. Such an objection\nincludes concerns that the institutional framework associated with\nanti-doping involves the violation of athletes\u2019 rights (Tamburrini,\n2013), that anti-doping policy too closely resembles a criminal justice\nsystem (Kornbeck, 2013), and that the normative assumptions that\nunderpin anti-doping campaigns are morally problematic.\nAnti-anti-doping advocates propose alternative regulations that often\ninvolve the legalization of currently banned substances and methods\n(P\u00e9rez Trivi\u00f1o, 2013; Tamburrini, 2000b; Tamburrini and\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, 2005; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, 2009) or the adoption of a\nharm-reduction approach (Kayser et al., 2005, 2007). \n3.4 Violent and Dangerous Sport\n\n\nExposure to the risk of significant physical harm is intrinsic to participation\nin many sports. The category of \u2018dangerous sport\u2019 includes\nnon-violent sports such as free solo rock-climbing and downhill skiing,\ncollision sports such as American football and rugby union, and combat\nsports such as boxing and mixed martial arts. What is the value of\ndangerous sports, and how, if at all, should the state regulate such\nactivities through public policy?\n\n\nRussell argues that dangerous sports manifest distinctive forms of\nvalue (2005). Their value lies in the perfectionist ideal of\n\u2018self-affirmation\u2019, whereby we challenge and resist the\nordinary bounds of our lives and attempt to extend those boundaries to\nsurpass the apparent limits of our being (Russell, 2005). Russell\nfurther argues that these kinds of sports can be of particular\npractical benefit for children. Such activities place children in a\ncontext in which they must confront danger, thereby preparing the child\nfor adulthood, as well as helping the child to discover and affirm\naspects of her selfhood (Russell, 2007).\n\n\nOthers have suggested that, in their current form, collision sports\nsuch as American football and combat sports such as boxing should be\nbanned by the state. Nicholas Dixon (2001) has argued on autonomy-based\ngrounds that boxing which involves blows to the head should be banned,\nbut boxing that limits the permissible target area to the area between\nthe waist and the head should be permitted. Others have defended the\nstatus quo on the grounds that any attempt to criminalise boxing will\nlead to the sport moving underground where more harm may result\n(Warburton, 1998).\n\n\nPam Sailors (2015) has argued that American football, both at the\nprofessional and amateur levels, is morally objectionable, though she\nstops short of proposing its prohibition. She grounds this objection on\nharm to the players, the objectification of the players, and the harms\ndone by players to non-players. Angelo Corlett (2019) has argued, more\nnarrowly, that a prohibition of American football at the\ninter-collegiate level could be justified on account of the large\nhealthcare and medical costs that must be borne by the general public\narising from associated injuries. Mike McNamee and Francisco Javier\nLopez Frias have called for caution regarding the proposed prohibition\nof American football and other collision sports that pose the risk of\npermanent brain injury. In particular, they critically analyze\narguments for the elimination of such sports that draw on Mill\u2019s\nconsensual domination principle. These arguments equate the decision of\nplaying football with that of selling oneself to slavery (consensual\ndomination). According to Lopez Frias and McNamee (2017), human beings\nshould be allowed to pursue the kind of lives that they have reasons to\nvalue, even if that involves consensual domination. For them, the\nnature of the goods people pursue in their lives might justify the\nsacrifice of future autonomy. Moreover, they challenge the idea that\nCTE-related injuries are morally equivalent to harms that arise from\nconsensual domination. In a latter paper, Lopez Frias and McNamee\npropose that one possible solution to the debate over the reform or\nprohibition of such sports should have at its centre the concept of\n\u2018social good\u2019 (Lopez Frias and McNamee, 2019).\n3.5 Sex, Gender, and Race\n\n\nSporting competition has traditionally been sex-segregated along the\nbinary \u2018male/female\u2019 distinction, and challenges to the\nprevailing understandings of sex and gender have been heard within the\nsporting community since the 1960s. Two principal questions with\nregard to sex and gender arise in sport: is sex segregation in sporting\ncompetition morally justifiable? If so, in what category should trans\nand intersex athletes compete?\n\n\nThe starting point for the sex segregation debate is Jane\nEnglish\u2019s \u2018Sex Equality in Sport\u2019 (1978). English\nconsiders what equality of opportunity between the sexes requires in\nsport. She argues that a just society would incorporate a greater\nvariety of sports than at present. Specifically, sports that reward\n\u2018women\u2019s distinctive abilities\u2019 (English, 1978, 227)\n(e.g. flexibility, low centre of gravity) would be more numerous. On\ngrounds of self-respect, women should enjoy roughly half of the\n\u2018basic benefits\u2019 of health and recreation. This includes\nthe right to equal facilities. This would require significant\nre-ordering of how resources are distributed between the sexes within\nsport. Ultimately, however, English advocates a (qualified)\nretention of binary sex segregation in sport. The contours of this\ndistinction have been challenged by intersex, trans, and non-gendered\nathletes who do not fit comfortably into either category. The question\n\u2018Who is a sportswoman?\u2019 (Camporesi, 2017) has never been\nmore contested.\n\n\nTo police sex segregation in competition, sports authorities have\nadopted a variety of approaches to sex verification at different times\nsince the 1930s. These have included visual tests, chromosome\ntests, and testosterone tests. The prevailing approach to the\neligibility of trans women to compete in women\u2019s events does not\npreclude those who are biologically male from competing in\nwomen\u2019s sport, but it requires that their testosterone level\nremains below a certain threshold for a period prior to and\ncontinuously throughout their time competing in women\u2019s\ncompetition (IOC, 2015). The requirement that trans, as well as\nintersex, women whose natural testosterone level is above the permitted\nthreshold must undergo hormone treatment (i.e. androgen suppressive\ntherapy) to bring their level below that threshold has been criticised\nas the unnecessary medicalisation of healthy athletes and a violation\nof the principle of beneficence in medical ethics. (Camporesi, 2016).\nCritics have suggested that athletes should not be required to meet\ncertain physiological criteria to be eligible to compete in a\nparticular gender category. Proposals sympathetic to this view have\nincluded that athletes should be allowed to compete in the gender\ncategory with which they identify (Davis and Edwards 2014); that trans\nwomen athletes should be allowed to compete in women\u2019s sport but,\nto mitigate unfair advantage, should be subject to a handicap based on\neffective testosterone levels (Bianchi, 2017); and, finally, that\neligibility should be determined by legally recognised gender (McKinnon\nand Conrad, forthcoming) \n\n\nAt the heart of this debate is whether trans women enjoy an unfair\nadvantage over cis female athletes (i.e. athletes who were assigned the sex of\nfemale at birth and whose gender identity is female). Some have suggested that testosterone has not been\nproved to provide an advantage in competition (Camporesi, 2016) or that\nthe advantage it provides, even if unfair, may be tolerably unfair\n(Devine, 2019). Moreover, no attempt is made to regulate other\nbiological and genetic variations that provide a clear performance\nadvantage. For example, there is no attempt to exclude or regulate\nathletes with Marfan syndrome. However, the long limbs and flexible\njoints associated with that condition provide a clear advantage for\nswimmers, basketball players, and volleyball players. It has been\nsuggested that, if there is no morally relevant difference between\nadvantages that result from sex and those that result from other\nbiological and genetic variations, why should testosterone levels be\nregulated when other such variations relevant to sporting performance\nare not (Camporesi 2017; Camporesi and Maugeri 2016)?\n\n\nA more fundamental challenge has been levelled at the very\ninstitution of sex segregation in sport. It has been proposed that the\norganisation of sport should be indifferent to an athlete\u2019s sex, so men and women should compete with and against each other. On this view,\nrather than retaining sex segregation, which involves\ndiscrimination against women as well as complex questions concerning\nthe proper categorization of intersex, trans, and non-gendered\nathletes, we should eliminate sex segregation altogether, and sport\nshould either be open (not segregated at all) (Tamburrini, 2000a, ch.\n6; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, 2000) or segregated along dimensions other than\nsex such as weight, height, haemoglobin level, or testosterone level\n(Knox et al, 2019).\n\n\nAside from the sex segregation question, there has been much\ndiscussion of sport as a site of gender politics. The role that sport\nplays in the construction of gender (including gender hierarchies) was\ntaken up in Iris Marion Young\u2019s classic paper \u2018Throwing\nLike a Girl\u2019 (1980) which explores the modalities of feminine bodily\nexistence for women in contemporary society. Young\u2019s central\nclaim is that such modalities of feminie movement, motility, and\nspatiality have as their source not anatomy or physiology but the\nparticular situation of women, which is shaped by sexist oppression\n(Young, 1980). The framework developed by Young has inspired\nphenomenologies of female embodiment in particular sports such as\nsurfing (Brennan, 2016) and climbing (Chisholm, 2008), which delineate\nthe oppression of women within these sporting communities arising from\nprevailing sexist notions of the female body. Young has also argued\nthat, as long as women\u2019s bodies are understood as objects, they\nare excluded by the culture from sport. This cultural exclusion of\nwomen from sport, in turn, creates a masculine bias within sport, which\nprecludes the exhibition of sport\u2019s potential humanity (Young,\n1979). There has also been discussion of whether the very nature of\ncompetiton \u2013 a central feature of sport \u2013 is masculinist\nand inherently incompatible with feminism (Davion, 1987).\n\n\nCompared to the well-developed literature around sex and gender in\nsport, issues around race and sport have received surprisingly little\nattention in the philosophy of sport literature (with exceptions\nincluding disparate articles by Mosley, 2003; Lapchick, 2003; and\nMarqusee, 2003). However, recent political activism by American\nfootball star Colin Kaepernick to highlight systematic racism in the\nUnited States against African Americans has inspired philosophical work\nabout race and sport, and the ethics of political activism by athletes\n(Brackett, 2017; Klein, 2017; Marston, 2017; Sailors, 2017; and Rorke\nand Copeland, 2017).\n\n\nSeveral Foucauldian post-structuralists and existentialists have\nexplored the connections between hegemonic racial power structures and\nsport (Early, 2007). For instance, writers such as Grant Farred (2018),\nErin C. Tarver (2018), and Katrhryn E. Henne (2015), have explored\nthemes around sports and white (and/or colonial) hegemonic interests.\nThey have examined whether sport and the engagement of minorities in\nsport perpetuates and promotes white privilege and white interests\n(Henne, 2015). They have also critiqued the hegemonic forces\npurportedly used by the institutionalized and corporate structure of\nsport to discipline and exploit minorities, especially in professional\nsport and American college sport (Hawkins, 2001; Farred,\n2018). \n3.6 Fans and Spectators\n\n\nWhat is the best way to watch sport? Is our fascination with and\nadmiration of elite sportspeople morally defensible? The debate about\nthe most valuable form of spectatorship has revolved around whether the\n\u2018purist\u2019 model of spectator is superior to the\n\u2018partisan\u2019 model. Purists derive aesthetic pleasure from\ngood play. They appreciate a virtuoso performance irrespective of the\nperformer, that is, irrespective of which team or athlete delivers it\n(Dixon, 2016). Purists have no allegiance to any particular team but\nappreciate feats of athletic excellence on their merits only. They\nappreciate good play, as one might appreciate a work of art without\nknowing or caring about the identity of the artist. For purists, a\nproper appreciation of the spectacle is paramount, and allegiance to a\nparticular team threatens to undermine a proper appreciation of\nsport. \n\n\nChief among the criticisms of purism (Russell, 2012; Feezell, 2013;\nMumford, 2011, 2012) is its neglect of partisanship. Partisans espouse\nthe virtue of supporting a particular team, even when that team plays\npoorly. Loyalty is paramount to partisans, and they follow their team\nthrough good times and bad.\nPartisans typically support their favoured team zealously, and they\ncheer for their team\u2019s success. For partisans, it matters that\ntheir team wins, even if they display less, or a lower form of,\nathletic excellence than the opposition.\n\n\nSome have argued that the admiration of individual sporting heroes,\ncharacteristic of purist spectators, is morally problematic. On this\nview, enthusiasm and awe surrounding the achievements of elite athletes\nare not morally respectable. Indeed, such attitudes reflect a\nfascistoid ideology (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1998, 2005). Admiration for\nwinners in sport involves the celebration of strength and, inevitably,\nthe expression of contempt for weakness. Strength is understood as a\ntrait for which one is not responsible but which has its origin in\ngenetics (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2005), so admiration for athletes based on\ntheir strength is thought fascistoid. On this view, in admiring the\nvictor(s), we cannot but demonstrate contempt for the loser(s):\nadmiration for the former and contempt for the latter are two sides of\nthe same coin.\n\n\nIt has been argued against T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\u2019s account that it\nis descriptive rather than normative. At best, T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\ndescribes how spectators do behave, not how they should behave.\nMoreover, admiration for the winner does not necessarily imply contempt\nfor the loser, and by extension, for the weak. Contra\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, there is no necessary link between these two\nattitudes. Our admiration of elite athletes need not rest on an\nappreciation of their excellence understood solely in terms of strength\n(Tamburrini, 2000, ch. 5), as admiration for sports stars, properly\nunderstood, is only to a limited extent admiration of them because of\ntheir physical strength (Persson, 2005).\n3.7 Disability Sport\n\n\n\u2018Disability sport\u2019, also referred to as\n\u2018Paralympic sport\u2019 or \u2018sport for athletes with\ndisabilities or impairments\u2019 contrasts with sport for able-bodied\npersons. The two principal ethical questions that arise regarding\ndisability sport are: 1. What criteria should be used to classify\ndisability athletes in competition?; and 2. Should disability athletes,\nspecifically those with prosthetic limbs, be allowed to compete with\nable-bodied athletes?\n\n\nWho may be considered a Paralympic athlete? In order to compete in\ndisability or Paralympic sport, one must be classed as having a\ndisability. The notion of disability is a contested concept (Boorse\n2010, 2011; Nordenfelt 1987, 2007). It is unsurprising, then, that,\nwhat counts as a disability for the purpose of sport and how to\ncategorise those with disabilities for the purpose of competition are\nmatters of some dispute (Edwards and McNamee 2015). For example, for an\nathlete to qualify as a disability athlete, must her disability be\npermanent, or could it be temporary? Could the disability be only\nsomewhat impairing or must it be profoundly impairing?\n\n\nCentral to this dispute is whether it is preferable to adopt a\n\u2018functional classification system\u2019, which would group\ntogether athletes with different disabilities but similar ability\nlevels, or a \u2018disability-specific classification system\u2019,\nwhich would group together athletes with similar types of disabilities\ndespite different capabilities. At least for the purposes of the\nquadrennial Paralympic Games, this question cannot be addressed\nadequately in isolation from the proper aims of the Paralympic\nMovement, including whether these aims are in contrast with, or even in\ntension with, those of elite able-bodied sport.\n\n\nThe second question concerns the appropriate relation between\ndisabled and able-bodied sport. Specifically, should disabled athletes\nwho use prosthetic limbs be allowed to compete in able-bodied sport?\nOscar Pistorius was controversially permitted to compete in the 400m\nat the Olympic Games in 2012 (in addition to the 2012 Paralympic Games)\ndespite using carbon-fibre prosthetic legs. Some objected that his\nprosthetic legs conferred him with an unfair advantage while others\nquestioned whether the prosthetics precluded him from\n\u2018running\u2019 in the relevant sense at all (Edwards, 2008).\n\n\nFinally, the practice of Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) operates\nin elite able-bodied and disability sport to allow athletes with\nchronic or temporary illness to use medication for therapeutic (as\nopposed to enhancement) purposes that they would otherwise be prohibited\nfrom using. This practice has proved controversial as the\ntherapy/enhancement distinction is difficult to specify with precision\n(Daniels, 2000), and the system has been criticised as open to abuse.\nHowever, if the use of such substances were denied across the board,\nathletes with chronic conditions, for example, would effectively be\nexcluded from sport on account of being unfairly disadvantaged (Pike,\n2018).\n3.8 The Aesthetics of Sport\n\n\nWhile the ethical analysis of sport has been the central preoccupation\nof recent philosophy of sport, the last two decades has seen a revived\ninterest in the aesthetic analysis of sport (Edgar, 2013b; Lacerda,\n2012a). The study of aesthetics and sport has focused on two principal\nareas. The first concerns the relevance of aesthetic qualities to the\nexperience of playing and watching sport. Does sport elicit aesthetic\nvalues?  If so, what are these values and are they inherent to or only\nincidental to sport?  The second examines the relationship between\nsport and art. Is sport one of the arts? If so, what makes sport an\nart? An early precursor of these discussions is C. L. R. James\u2019\n(1963) classic, Beyond a Boundary. In his seminal analysis of\ncricket, James explores the identity between sport and art, arguing\nthat both yield aesthetic pleasure because they have been created to\nbe beautiful.\n\n\nRelated to both of these concerns is whether the aesthetic\nappreciation of sport is distinctive, that is, different in kind to\nother forms of aesthetic appreciation. For Joseph Kupfer (1975), sport\nhas multiple purposes. One of these purposes is to create aesthetically\npleasant experiences. Stephen Mumford (2011) observes that the\naesthetic values elicited by sports depend on the physical demands that\neach sport makes of participants. However, in Mumford\u2019s view, all\nsports yield aesthetic experiences related to bodily motion and grace,\nhigh-level abstract forms, drama, and innovation and genius. Edgar\n(2012, 2013a) criticizes this view as narrow because it connects sport\nonly to values related to harmony, neglecting the fact that sport is\nalso ugly. Since sport yields aesthetic pleasure, James (1963) argues\nthat sport should be seen as one of the arts. More recently, Spencer K.\nWertz (1985; 1985), Hans Ulrich Gumbretch (2006), and Wolfgang Welsch\n(1999) have supported the idea that sport has aesthetic qualities and\nthat sport should be regarded as an art. However, some have denied\nsport\u2019s artistic credentials.\n\n\nEliseo Vivas (1959, p. 228) contends that, unlike aesthetic\nexperiences, sport cannot be experienced disinterestedly. To do so, one\nmust bracket an essential feature of sport: competition. For Maureen\nKovich (1971), if athletes and spectators focused on the aesthetic\naspects of sport, their preoccupation would be the observation and\ncreation of art in movement rather than on scoring and winning. The\nmain purpose of sport is to meet physical challenges and to compare\noneself to others in doing so. For instance, in the high jump, the goal\nis to clear the bar by jumping over it. Athletes compete to see who can\njump the highest, not the most beautifully. Dick Fosbury introduced the\n\u2018flop\u2019 not because it was more beautiful than previous\ntechniques (i.e., scissors, western roll, and straddle jump), but\nbecause it was more effective (2007). To ignore the essential\ncompetitive elements of sport in favor of aesthetic principles is to\nfail to take sport seriously. To strengthen this claim, Paul Ziff\n(1974) argues that some sporting events have little or no aesthetic\nvalue. Often, athletes play dirty and achieve ugly victories. In\nsupport of this view, David Best (1974, 1985) argues that most athletes\nprefer an ugly victory than a defeat where they have performed\ngracefully. On this view, not only is aesthetics inessential to sport,\nbut the pursuit of aesthetic purposes can undermine the achievement of\nsport\u2019s main goals. Thus, Ray Elliot (1974) posits that the\ngoddess of sport is not Beauty but Victory. Creating beauty should\nnever be the main goal of sport. Aesthetics is incidental in sport,\nwhereas, in art, it is the principal aim. Therefore, sport is not an\nart.\n\n\nA further challenge to the idea that sport can be art is that art\nconcerns something beyond itself, whereas sport concerns play and\nnothing in real life beyond play. For instance, an actor playing Hamlet\nis not Hamlet in real life. They represent the modern\nindividual\u2019s existential struggle. By contrast, a point guard in\nbasketball is actually a point guard; point guards do not represent\nanything outside the game of basketball. In response, Kevin Krein\n(2008) and Tim L. Elcombe (2012) have argued that, like art, sports\nconvey values and meanings external to sport that represent, or present\nan alternative to (in the case of non-traditional sports such as\nclimbing and surfing), the culture in which sport practitioners find\nthemselves. In Terrence J. Roberts\u2019 (1995) view, athletes are\n\u2018strong poets.\u2019 They expresses something about our life\nsituation as embodied agents (Mumford, 2014). Drawing on Nelson Goodman\n(1978), philosophers such as Edgar, Breivik, and Krein understand sport\nas worldmaking, that is, sport embraces and refigures symbolic worlds\noutside of sport, opening up new ways of describing, or making, such\nnon-sporting worlds. Sport provides resources for re-describing the\nnon-sporting world. Building upon this view of sport, Edgar (2013a)\nargues for a shift from sport aesthetics to sport hermeneutics, that\nis, to the interpretation of the meaning of sport and how that meaning\nis interpreted (see Lopez Frias & Edgar, 2016). \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abad, D., 2010, \u201cSportsmanship,\u201d <em>Sport, Ethics and\nPhilosophy</em>, 4(1): 27\u201341.", "Andrieu, B., 2014, \u201cThe Birth of the Philosophy of Sport in\nFrance 1950\u20131980.
