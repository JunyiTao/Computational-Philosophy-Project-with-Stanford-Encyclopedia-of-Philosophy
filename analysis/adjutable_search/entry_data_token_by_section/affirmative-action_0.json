    "main_text": "In the Beginning\n1. In the Beginning\n\n\nIn 1972, affirmative action became an inflammatory public issue.\nTrue enough, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already had made something\ncalled \u201caffirmative action\u201d a remedy federal courts could\nimpose on violators of the Act. Likewise, after 1965 federal\ncontractors had been subject to President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Executive\nOrder 11246, requiring them to take \u201caffirmative action\u201d to\nmake sure they were not discriminating. But what did this 1965 mandate\namount to? The Executive Order assigned to the Secretary of Labor the\njob of specifying rules of implementation. In the meantime, as the\nfederal courts were enforcing the Civil Rights Act against\ndiscriminating companies, unions, and other institutions, the\nDepartment of Labor mounted an ad hoc attack on the construction\nindustry by cajoling, threatening, negotiating, and generally\nstrong-arming reluctant construction firms into a series of region-wide\n\u201cplans\u201d in which they committed themselves to numerical\nhiring goals. Through these contractor commitments, the Department\ncould indirectly pressure recalcitrant labor unions, who supplied the\nemployees at job sites.\n\n\nWhile the occasional court case and government initiative made the\nnews and stirred some controversy, affirmative action was pretty far\ndown the list of public excitements until the autumn of 1972, when the\nSecretary of Labor\u2019s Revised Order No. 4, fully implementing the\nExecutive Order, landed on campus by way of directives from the\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare. Its predecessor, Order\nNo. 4, first promulgated in 1970, cast a wide net over American\ninstitutions, both public and private. By extending to all contractors\nthe basic apparatus of the construction industry \u201cplans,\u201d\nthe Order imposed a one-size-fits-all system of \n\u201cunderutilization analyses,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d and\n\u201ctimetables\u201d on hospitals, banks, trucking companies,\nsteel mills, printers, airlines\u2014indeed, on all the scores of\nthousands of institutions, large and small, that did business with the\ngovernment, including a special set of institutions with a\nparticularly voluble and articulate constituency, namely, American\nuniversities.\n\n\nAt first, university administrators and faculty found the rules of\nOrder No. 4 murky but hardly a threat to the established order. The\nnumber of racial and ethnic minorities receiving PhDs each year and\nthus eligible for faculty jobs was tiny. Any mandate to increase their\nrepresentation on campus would require more diligent searches by\nuniversities, to be sure, but searches fated nevertheless largely to\nmirror past results. The 1972 Revised Order, on the other hand, effected a\nchange that punctured any campus complacency: it included women among\nthe \u201cprotected classes\u201d whose\n\u201cunderutilization\u201d demanded the setting of\n\u201cgoals\u201d and \u201ctimetables\u201d for \u201cfull\nutilization\u201d (Graham 1990, 413). Unlike African-Americans and\nHispanics, women were getting PhDs in substantial and growing\nnumbers. If the affirmative action required of federal contractors was\na recipe for \u201cproportional representation,\u201d then Revised\nOrder No. 4 was bound to leave a large footprint on campus. Some among\nthe professoriate exploded in a fury of opposition to the new rules,\nwhile others responded with an equally vehement defense of\nthem.[2]\n\n\nAs it happened, these events coincided with another development,\nnamely the \u201cpublic turn\u201d in philosophy. For several\ndecades Anglo-American philosophy had treated moral and political\nquestions obliquely. On the prevailing view, philosophers were suited\nonly to do \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d\u2014they could lay\nbare, for example, the conceptual architecture of the idea of justice,\nbut they were not competent to suggest political principles,\nconstitutional arrangements, or social policies that actually did\njustice.  Philosophers might do \u201cmeta-ethics\u201d but not\n\u201cnormative ethics.\u201d This viewed collapsed in the 1970s\nunder the weight of two counter-blows. First, John Rawls published in\n1971 A Theory of Justice, an elaborate, elegant, and inspiring\ndefense of a normative theory of justice (Rawls 1971).\nSecond, in the same year Philosophy & Public Affairs,\nwith Princeton University\u2019s impeccable pedigree, began life, a few\nmonths after Florida State\u2019s Social Theory and\nPractice. These journals, along with a re-tooled older\nperiodical, Ethics, became self-conscious platforms for\nsocially and politically engaged philosophical writing, born out of\nthe feeling that in time of war (the Vietnam War) and social tumult\n(the Civil Rights Movement, Women\u2019s Liberation), philosophers ought to\ndo, not simply talk about, ethics.  In 1973, Philosophy &\nPublic Affairs published Thomas Nagel\u2019s \u201cEqual Treatment\nand Compensatory Justice\u201d (Nagel 1973) and Judith Jarvis\nThomson\u2019s \u201cPreferential Hiring\u201d (Thomson 1973), and the\nphilosophical literature on affirmative action burgeoned\n forth.[3]\n\n\nIn contention was the nature of those \u201cgoals\u201d and\n\u201ctimetables\u201d imposed on every contractor by Revised Order\nNo. 4. Weren\u2019t the \u201cgoals\u201d tantamount to\n\u201cquotas,\u201d requiring institutions to use racial or gender\npreferences in their selection processes? Some answered\n\u201cno\u201d (Ezorsky 1977, 86).  Properly understood, affirmative\naction did not require (or even permit) the use of gender or racial\npreferences.  Others said \u201cyes\u201d (Goldman 1976, 182\u20133).\nAffirmative action, if it did not impose preferences outright, at\nleast countenanced them.  Among the yea-sayers, opinion divided\nbetween those who said preferences were morally permissible and those\nwho said they were not.  Within the \u201cmorally permissible\u201d\nset, different writers put forward different justifications.\n",
