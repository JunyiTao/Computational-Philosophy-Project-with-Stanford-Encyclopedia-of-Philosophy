This includes Zhou Dunyi (1017\u20131073), who\nproduced a diagram and supplementary exposition that characterizes all\nphenomena as being governed by Taiji \u592a\u6975\n(variously translated as the Great Ultimate, Supreme Polarity, or the\nSupreme Pivot), a kind of ordering principle that explains the natural\nfluctuations of yin and yang or stillness and\nactivity (Adler 2014). Another founding figure was Zhang Zai\n(1020\u20131077). Zhang developed influential ways of thinking about\nhuman nature and the cultivation of virtue, ones that account for\nvariations of character in terms of varying qualities of qi\n\u6c23 (psychophysical energy, vital stuff). He also developed a\nmetaphysics that conceived of individuals as part of a cosmic whole,\nrelated by nature to all other things as though members of a family or\nparts of the same body, and thus having family-like obligations to\ncare for all others. One of his brief but stirring encapsulations of\nthis view became perhaps the most famous inspirational essay in the\nNeo-Confucian tradition, called \u201cThe Western Inscription\u201d\nas it had been written on the western wall of his study (Tiwald &\nVan Norden 2014: 134\u2013136).\n\nAt the center of this Northern Song group were the brothers Cheng Hao\n(1032\u20131085) and Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107), who studied with\nboth Zhou and Zhang but developed their own systems of thought that\ncame to be reflected in almost every area of Neo-Confucianism. The\nChengs offered different metaphysical frameworks to account for Zhang\nZai\u2019s conception of all things as parts of a family-like or\nbody-like whole, developed a sophisticated, multi-faceted moral\npsychology of the major virtues, honed Confucian objections to\nBuddhism and Daoism, and advanced distinctive theories of proper\ngovernance and administration (Graham 1992; Ivanhoe 2016: 24\u201348;\nTiwald & Van Norden 2014: 140\u2013167). Some scholars also add\nto these four Northern Song Confucians a fifth founding figure, Shao\nYong (1011\u20131077), best known for developing mathematical and\nnumerological laws and maintaining that certain kinds of human\nsubjectivity are incompatible with knowledge of things (Birdwhistell\n1989; Wyatt 1996). Shao was also personally acquainted and dialogued\nwith the Cheng brothers, although compared with the Chengs his\nwritings show little direct concern with developing theories about\nvirtue and personal cultivation. What became the most widely read\nanthology of the founders of Song Confucianism, a kind of textbook\ncalled Reflections on Things at Hand, omitted Shao in favor\nof the other four Northern Song masters (JSL). Three of these\nNorthern Song thinkers\u2014Zhang Zai, Cheng Hao, and Cheng\nYi\u2014were at times heavily involved in politics and became\nassociated with the opposition to the famous minister and reformer\nWang Anshi (1021\u20131086).\n",
