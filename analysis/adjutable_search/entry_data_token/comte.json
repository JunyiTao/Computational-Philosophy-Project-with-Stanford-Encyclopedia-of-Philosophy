It sank into\nan almost complete oblivion during the twentieth, when it was eclipsed\nby neopositivism. However, Comte\u2019s decision to develop\nsuccessively a philosophy of mathematics, a philosophy of physics, a\nphilosophy of chemistry and a philosophy of biology, makes him the\nfirst philosopher of science in the modern sense, and his constant\nattention to the social dimension of science resonates in many\nrespects with current points of view. His political philosophy, on the\nother hand, is even less known, because it differs substantially from\nthe classical political philosophy we have inherited.\n\nComte\u2019s most important works are (1) the Course on Positive\nPhilosophy (1830\u20131842, six volumes, translated and\ncondensed by Harriet Martineau as The Positive Philosophy of\nAuguste Comte); (2) the System of Positive Polity, or\nTreatise on Sociology, Instituting the Religion of Humanity,\n(1851\u20131854, four volumes); and (3) the Early Writings\n(1820\u20131829), where one can see the influence of Saint-Simon, for\nwhom Comte served as secretary from 1817 to 1824. The Early\nWritings are still the best introduction to Comte\u2019s\nthought. In the Course, Comte said, science was transformed\ninto philosophy; in the System, philosophy was transformed\ninto religion. The second transformation met with strong opposition;\nas a result, it has become customary to distinguish, with Mill,\nbetween a \u201cgood Comte\u201d (the author of the Course)\nand a \u201cbad Comte\u201d (the author of the System).\nToday\u2019s common conception of positivism corresponds mainly to\nwhat can be found in the Course.\n", "toc": [{"#Int": "1.

Introduction\n\nIt is difficult today to appreciate the interest Comte\u2019s thought\nenjoyed a century ago, for it has received almost no notice during the\nlast five decades. Before the First World War, Comte\u2019s movement\nwas active nearly everywhere in the world (Pl\u00e9 1996; Simon\n1963). The best known case is that of Latin America: Brazil, which\nowes the motto on its flag \u2018Ordem e Progresso\u2019 (Order and\nProgress) to Comte (Trindade 2003), and Mexico (Hale 1989) are two\nprominent examples. The positivists, i.e., the followers of Comte,\nwere equally active in England (Wright 1986), the United States\n(Cashdollars 1989; Harp 1994) and India (Forbes 1975). And in the case\nof Turkey, its modern secular character can be traced to Comte\u2019s\ninfluence on the Young Turks.\n\nNone of this activity survived the First World War. The new balance of\npower created by the Russian Revolution left no room for positive\npolity, and Comtean positivism was taken over by neo-positivism in\nphilosophy of science. The term \u2018post-positivism\u2019, used in\nthe second half of the 20th century, demonstrates the complete\ndisappearance of what one might call, in retrospect,\n\u201cpaleo-positivism\u201d. As a matter of fact, post-positivism\nis a kind of \u201cpost-neo-positivism\u201d, since the well-known\ncriticisms launched by Kuhn and Feyerabend were directed at\nCarnap\u2019s neopositivism, not Comte\u2019s positivism, about\nwhich they seem to have known very little. This shows that their use\nof \u201cpositivism\u201d forgets totally Comte, who is nevertheless\nthe man who coined the term. Moreover, in a number of cases, the\npost-positivists simply rediscovered points that were well established\nin paleo-positivism (such as the need to take into account the context\nof justification and the social dimension of science) but subsequently\nforgotten.\n\nThis unexpected agreement between the paleo- and post-positivists\nshows that there is some enduring substance to Comte\u2019s original\nthinking and partially explains why Comtean studies have seen a strong\nrevival of late (Bourdeau 2018, Schmaus 2021). Philosophers and\nsociologists have begun to draw attention to the interesting views\ndefended over a century and a half ago by the founder of positivism.\nIt thus seems that the eclipse of the original positivism is nearing\nits end.\n\nOne quickly notices the gap between the meaning that\n\u2018positivism\u2019 had for Comte in the 19th century and the\nmeaning that it has come to have in our times. Thus, contrary to what\nis usually thought, Comte\u2019s positivism is not a philosophy of\nscience but a political philosophy. Or, if one prefers, Comte\u2019s\npositivism is a remarkable philosophy that doesn\u2019t separate\nphilosophy of science from political philosophy. The title of what\nComte always regarded as his seminal work (written in 1822 when he was\nonly 24 years old) leaves no doubt as to the bond between science and\npolitics: it is Plan for the Scientific Work Necessary to\nReorganize Society, also called First System of Positive\nPolity. Its goal is the reorganization of society. Science gets\ninvolved only after politics, when Comte suggests calling in\nscientists to achieve that goal. So, while science plays a central\nrole in positive polity, positivism is anything but a blind admiration\nfor science. From 1847, positivism is placed under the\n\u2018continuous dominance of the heart\u2019 (la\npr\u00e9ponderance continue du coeur), and the motto\n\u2018Order and Progress\u2019 becomes \u2018Love as principle,\norder as basis, progress as end\u2019 (L\u2019amour pour\nprincipe, l\u2019ordre pour base et le progr\u00e8s pour but).\nThis turn, unexpected for many of his contemporaries, was in fact well\nmotivated and is characteristic of the very dynamics of Comte\u2019s\nthought.\n\nThe \u2018complete positivism\u2019 of what Comte himself called his\n\u2018second career\u2019 has on the whole been judged severely.\nVery quickly, the most famous admirers of the early Course of\nPositive Philosophy (1830\u20131842), such as Mill and\nLittr\u00e9, disavowed the author of the later System of\nPositive Polity (1851\u20131854), thereby giving substance to\nthe idea that there is a good and a bad Comte. Nevertheless, if his\nearly writings call for a revision of the standard interpretation of\npositivism, this is even more the case for the works of his\n\u2018second career\u2019.\n\nFrom these introductory remarks, some of the main threads of what\nfollows can already be seen. First, whatever the exact worth of the\ntwo groups of writings that surround it may be, the Course of\nPositive Philosophy (hereafter Course) remains\nComte\u2019s major contribution. Second, an interpretation of the\nwhole of Comte\u2019s work is confronted with two problems. The first\nproblem concerns the unity of Comte\u2019s thought: do the first and\nthe second career form a continuum, or is there a break? The second\nproblem concerns Comte\u2019s relationship to Saint-Simon (see below\n3.2.): is the founder of positivism merely one Saint-Simonian among\nothers, as Durkheim maintained, or should one, as Gouhier (1933)\nproposed, follow Comte himself, who on this matter spoke of a\n\u2018disastrous contact\u2019 that had, at best, merely hindered\nhis \u2018spontaneous development\u2019 (1830 (56), v. 2,\n 466)?[1].\n\nAs an approach to Comte\u2019s philosophy, the chronological order\nseems the most appropriate guide. After a quick review of some\nbiographical facts, we will deal first with the Saint-Simonian period\nand the early writings, and then with the two great works that stand\nout: the Course of Positive Philosophy (six volumes,\n1830\u20131842), and the System of Positive Polity (four\nvolumes, 1851\u20131854).\n2. Biography\n\nComte was born in Montpellier on January 20, 1798 (\u2018le 1er\npluvi\u00f4se de l\u2019an VI\u2019, according to the Revolutionary\ncalendar then in use in France). Having displayed his brilliance in\nschool, he was ranked fourth on the admissions list of the\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris in 1814. Two years later, the\nBourbons closed that institution, and its students were dismissed. In\nAugust 1817, Auguste Comte met Henri de Saint-Simon, who appointed him\nas his secretary to replace Augustin Thierry. The young Comte was thus\ninitiated into politics and was able to publish a great number of\narticles, which placed him very much in the public eye. (The most\nimportant of these articles were republished by him in 1854 and remain\nthe best introduction to his oeuvre as a whole.) In April 1824, he\nbroke with Saint-Simon. Shortly afterward, in a civil wedding, he\nmarried Caroline Massin, who had been living with him for several\nmonths. In April 1826, Comte began teaching a Course of Positive\nPhilosophy, whose audience included some of the most famous\nscientists of the time (Fourier, A. von Humboldt, Poinsot). It was\nsuddenly interrupted because of a \u2018cerebral crisis\u2019 due to\noverwork and conjugal sorrows. Comte was then hospitalized in the\nclinic of Dr. Esquirol. Upon leaving, he was classified as \u2018not\ncured\u2019. He recovered gradually, thanks to the devotion and\npatience of his wife.\n\nThe resumption of the Course of Positive Philosophy in\nJanuary 1829, marks the beginning of a second period in Comte\u2019s\nlife that lasted 13 years and included the publication of the six\nvolumes of the Course (1830, 1835, 1838, 1839, 1841, 1842).\nIn addition, during this period, more and more of his ties with the\nacademic world were severed. After being named tutor in analysis and\nmechanics at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1832, in 1833 he sought\nto create a chair in general history of science at the Coll\u00e8ge\nde France, but to no avail. Two unsuccessful candidacies for the rank\nof professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique led him in 1842 to\npublish a \u2018personal preface\u2019 to the last volume of the\nCourse, which put him at odds with the university world\nforever. The two years that followed mark a period of transition. In\nquick succession, Comte published an Elementary Treatise on\nAnalytic Geometry (1843), his only mathematical work, and the\nPhilosophical Treatise on Popular Astronomy (1844), the fruit\nof a yearly course, begun in 1830, for Parisian workers. The\nDiscourse on the Positive Spirit, also from 1844, which he\nused as the preface to the treatise on astronomy, marked a sharp\nchange of direction by its emphasis on the moral dimension of the new\nphilosophy: now that the sciences had been systematized, Comte was\nable to return to his initial interest, political philosophy. Public\nrecognition of the positivist Comte, as opposed to the saint-simonian,\ntwenty years earlier, came with \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9\u2019s\narticles in Le National.\n\nThe year 1844 also marked his first encounter with Clotilde de Vaux.\nWhat followed was the \u2018year like none other\u2019 that launched\nwhat Comte himself called his \u2018second career\u2019. The main\ntheme of the second career was the \u2018continuous dominance of the\nheart\u2019. An abundant correspondence testifies to Comte\u2019s\npassion, who, in spite of a heavy teaching load, found the time to\nstart working on the System of Positive Polity, which he had\nannounced at the end of the Course. After Clotilde\u2019s\ndeath, in April 1846, Comte began to idolize her, to such an extent\nthat it became a true cult. A few months later, his correspondence\nwith Mill, begun in December 1841, came to an end. The next year,\nComte chose the evolution of Humanity as the new topic for his public\ncourse; this was an occasion to lay down the premises of what would\nbecome the new Religion of Humanity. He was an enthusiastic supporter\nof the revolution of 1848: he founded the Positivist Society, modelled\nafter the Club of the Jacobins, and published the General View of\nPositivism, conceived of as an introduction to the\nSystem to come, as well as the Positivist Calendar.\nIn 1849, he founded the Religion of Humanity.\n\nThe years 1851\u20131854 were dominated by the publication of the\nfour-volume System of Positive Polity, which was interrupted\nfor a few months in order for him to write the Catechism of\nPositive Religion (1852). Relieved of all his duties at the\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique, Comte now lived off of the\n\u2018voluntary subsidy\u2019 begun by the followers of his in\nEngland and now also granted to him from various countries. In\nDecember 1851, Comte applauded the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by\nNapoleon III, who put an end to the parliamentary\n\u2018anarchy\u2019. Littr\u00e9 refused to follow Comte on this\npoint, as on the question of religion, and broke with him shortly\nafter. Soon disappointed by the Second Empire, Comte shifted his hopes\nto Czar Nicholas I, to whom he wrote. In 1853, Harriet Martineau\npublished a condensed English translation of the Course of\nPositive Philosophy.\n\nDisappointed by the unenthusiastic response his work got from the\nworkers, Comte launched an Appeal to Conservatives in 1855.\nThe next year, he published the first volume of a work on the\nphilosophy of mathematics announced in 1842, under the new title of\nSubjective Synthesis, or Universal System of the Conceptions\nAdapted to the Normal State of Humanity. Increasingly occupied by\nhis function as High Priest of Humanity, he sent an emissary to the\nJesuits in Rome proposing an alliance with the\n\u2018Ignacians\u2019.\n\nComte died on September 5, 1857, without having had time to draft the\ntexts announced up to 35 years before: a Treatise of Universal\nEducation, which he thought he could publish in 1858, a\nSystem of Positive Industry, or Treatise on the Total Action of\nHumanity on the Planet, planned for 1861, and, finally, for 1867,\na Treatise of First Philosophy. He is buried in the\nP\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery, where his Brazilian followers erected a\nstatue of Humanity in 1983.\n3. The Formative Years: The Collaboration with Saint-Simon and the Early Writings\n\nThe early writings remain the required starting point for everyone who\nwishes to understand the goal that Comte incessantly pursued. It is\nnot without reason that on the first page of the System Comte\napplied to himself Alfred de Vigny\u2019s words: \u2018What is a\ngreat life? A thought of youth, executed by mature age.\u2019 His\nformative years were dominated by his relationship with Saint-Simon.\nWhen meeting him in 1817, Comte, like his fellow students at the\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique, had just been dismissed by Louis XVIII and\nwas therefore looking for a job. He even thought of emigrating to the\nUnited States to teach at a school that Jefferson was planning to open\nand which was to be modeled on the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. The\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique, whose faculty included the likes of Arago,\nLaplace, Cauchy, and Poisson, had been for Comte what the\nEvangelisches Stift in T\u00fcbingen had been for Hegel.\nThere, he got an education in science that was second to none in all\nof Europe; it left a permanent imprint on him. But he was equally a\ntypical representative of the generation of Tocqueville and Guizot\nthat saw itself confronted with the question of how to stop the\nRevolution after the collapse of the Empire. \u2018How,\u2019 as\nComte would put it in 1848, \u2018does one reorganize human life,\nirrespectively of God and king\u2019? (1851, v. 1, 127; E., v. 1,\n100) It is from this perspective that his profound hostility towards\nclassical political philosophy \u2014philosophy that we continue to\nrespect today\u2014 has to be understood. With its insistence on\nfreedom of conscience and on the sovereignty of the people\n(souverainet\u00e9 populaire), the revolutionary doctrine\nhad no other function than to destroy the Ancien\nR\u00e9gime (founded on papal authority and monarchy by divine\nright). But in that task it had now succeeded. The moment had come for\nreconstruction, and it was hard to see how these weapons could be of\nuse in such work.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is not surprising that the young Comte\nturned to Saint-Simon. The latter, taking advantage of the relative\nfreedom of the press granted by Louis XVIII, published more and more\npamphlets and magazines, and therefore needed a collaborator. Comte\ntook over three ideas from the complex thought of Saint-Simon:\n\nThe contrast between organic and critical periods in history, of\nwhich the Revolution had just provided an example.\nThe idea of industrial society. In 1817, under the influence,\nnotably, of B. Constant and J.-B. Say, Saint-Simon had turned himself\ninto an apostle of industry. As an attentive observer of the\nindustrial revolution that was going on before his eyes, he understood\nthat it would completely change all existing social relations.\nHeretofore, we had lived in military societies: man acted on man, and\npower belonged to the warrior class. Henceforth, trade would replace\nwar, and man would mainly concern himself with acting on nature. Comte\ndrew the quite mistaken conclusion that the era of wars was over (Aron\n1957).\nThe idea of spiritual power. This is Comte\u2019s most obvious\ndebt to Saint-Simon. The theme was present from the first work by\nSaint-Simon (Letters from an Inhabitant of Geneva to his\nContemporaries, 1803) to the last (The New Christianity,\n1825). It resulted from an observation and a conviction. Saint-Simon\nobserved the role of science in modern society: he suggested, for\nexample, that public funds be made available to finance scientific\nresearch. He was also convinced of the religious nature of social\ncohesion and, therefore, of the need for a priestly class in charge of\nmaintaining it. This belief led him to the idea of a science of social\norganization, linking these two components: religion would become an\napplication of science, permitting enlightened men to govern the\nignorant. So, instead of trying to destroy every form of religious\nlife, one should entrust to the learned the spiritual power left\nweakened by the decline of traditional religions. It is also within\nthis framework that the text he wrote in 1814 on the reorganization of\nEuropean society has to be understood: handling international\nrelations are one of the main attributes of spiritual power, as shown\nby the medieval papacy.\n\n\nComte quickly assimilated what Saint-Simon had to offer him. But Comte\naspired to free himself of a tutelage that weighed ever heavier on\nhim, as he found the unmethodical and fickle mind of the self-taught,\nphilanthropic aristocrat barely tolerable. The break occurred in 1824,\noccasioned by a shorter work of Comte that would prove to be\nfundamental. Aware of already possessing the main ideas of his own\nphilosophy, Comte accused his teacher of trying to appropriate his\nwork and furthermore, he pointed out that he had not contented himself\nwith giving a systematic form to borrowed concepts (Bourdeau 2019).\nThe Philosophical Considerations on the Sciences and the\nScientists (1825) contains the first and classical formulations\nof the two cornerstones of positivism: the law of the three stages,\nand the classification of the sciences. The Considerations on\nSpiritual Power that followed some months later presents\ndogmatism as the normal state of the human mind. It is not difficult\nto find behind that statement, which may seem outrageous to us, the\nanti-Cartesianism that Comte shares with Peirce and that brings their\nphilosophies closer to one another. As the mind spontaneously stays\nwith what seems true to it, the irritation of doubt ceases when belief\nis fixed; what is in need of justification, one might say, is not the\nbelief but the doubt. Thus the concept of positive faith is brought\nout, that is to say, the necessity of a social theory of belief and\nits correlate, the logical theory of authority (Bourdeau 2011).\n\nIn the year 1826 two major events take place. First, Comte\u2019s\nprogram was reshaped. The first System of 1822 was\nunfinished, and writing the remaining part was one of Comte\u2019s\npriorities. But in 1826 he postponed that project for an indeterminate\nperiod. To provide a more solid base for the social science and its\nresulting positive polity, he decided first to go through the whole of\npositive knowledge again and to begin a course on positive philosophy.\nIt should be kept in mind that the Course does not belong to\nComte\u2019s initial program and that it originally was meant as a\nparenthesis, or prelude, that was supposed to take a few years at\nmost. The second major event of 1826, the famous \u2018cerebral\ncrisis\u2019 which occurred immediately after the opening lecture of\nthe course forced Comte to stop his public lessons; but it also had\nlongstanding effects. Thus it is customary to say that Comte received\npublic acknowledgement only belatedly: in 1842, with the first letter\nfrom Mill, and in 1844, with the articles of Littr\u00e9 in Le\nNational. But that amounts to forgetting that in 1826 Comte was a\nwell-known personality in the intellectual circles of Paris. Guizot\nand Lamennais held him in high esteem. The Course\u2019s\nattendance list included prestigious names such as A. von Humboldt,\nArago, Broussais or Fourier. Mill, who had visited Saint-Simon in\n1820\u201321, was deeply impressed by the first System,\nwhich one of Comte\u2019s pupils had introduced him to in 1829 (Mill\n1963, v. 12, 34). Finally, even though Comte had broken with\nSaint-Simon, the general public saw him as one of the master\u2019s\nmost authoritative spokesmen. This earned him the somewhat peculiar\nanimosity of the Saint-Simonians: they, with few exceptions, had the\ndistinctive characteristic of never having personally known the one\nthey called \u2018the father\u2019, whereas Comte had been on\nintimate terms with him. However, the cerebral crisis made Comte\nunable to take advantage of the high regard he enjoyed: he disappeared\nfrom the public scene until 1844.\n4. The Course on Positive Philosophy and the Friendship with Mill\n\nAs said in its first lesson, the Course pursues two goals.\nThe first, a specific one, is a foundation for sociology, then called\n\u2018social physics\u2019. The second, a general goal, is the\ncoordination of the whole of positive knowledge. The structure of the\nwork reflects this duality: the first three volumes examine the five\nfundamental sciences then in existence (mathematics, astronomy,\nphysics, chemistry, biology), and the final three volumes deal with\nthe social sciences. Executing the two parts did not require the same\namount of work. In the first case, the sciences had already been\nformed and it was just a matter of summarizing their main doctrinal\nand methodological points. In the other case, however, all was still\nto be done, and Comte was well aware that he was founding a new\nscience.\n4.1 The law of the three stages\n\nThe structure of the Course explains why the law of the three\nstages (which is often the only thing known about Comte) is stated\ntwice. Properly speaking, the law belongs to dynamic sociology or\ntheory of social progress, and this is why it serves as an\nintroduction to the long history lessons in the fifth and sixth\nvolumes. But it equally serves as an introduction to the work as a\nwhole, to the extent that its author considers this law the best way\nto explain what positive philosophy is.\n\nThe law states that, in its development, humanity passes through three\nsuccessive stages: the theological, the metaphysical, and the\npositive. The first is the necessary starting point for the human\nmind; the last, its normal state; the second is but a transitory stage\nthat makes possible the passage from the first to the last. In the\ntheological stage, the human mind, in its search for the primary and\nfinal causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the\nuniverse as interventions of supernatural agents. The second stage is\nonly a simple modification of the first: the questions remain the\nsame, but in the answers supernatural agents are replaced by abstract\nentities. In the positive state, the mind stops looking for causes of\nphenomena, and limits itself strictly to laws governing them;\nlikewise, absolute notions are replaced by relative ones. Moreover, if\none considers material development, the theological stage may also be\ncalled military, and the positive stage industrial; the metaphysical\nstage corresponds to a supremacy of the lawyers and\n jurists.[2].\n\nThis relativism of the third stage is the most characteristic property\nof positivism. It is often mistakenly identified with scepticism, but\nour earlier remark about dogmatism prevents us from doing so.\n\nFor Comte, science is a \u201cconnaissance approch\u00e9e\u201d:\nit comes closer and closer to truth, without reaching it. There is no\nplace for absolute truth, but neither are there higher standards for\nthe fixation of belief. Comte is here quite close to Peirce in his\nfamous 1877 paper.\n\nThe law of the three stages belongs to those grand philosophies of\nhistory elaborated in the 19th century, which now seem quite alien to\nus (for a different opinion, see Schmaus (1982)). The idea of progress\nof Humanity appears to us as the expression of an optimism that the\nevents of the 20th century have done much to reduce (Bourdeau 2006).\nMore generally, the notion of a law of history is problematic (even\nthough it did not seem so to Mill (1842, bk. VI, chap. X)). Already\nDurkheim felt forced to exclude social dynamics from sociology, in\norder to give it a truly scientific status.\n\nThese difficulties, however, are far from fatal to this aspect of\nComte\u2019s thought. Putting aside the fact that the idea of moral\nprogress is slowly regaining some support, it is possible to interpret\nthe three stages as forms of the mind that co-exist whose relative\nimportance varies in time. This interpretation seems to be offered by\nComte himself, who gives several examples of it in his history\nlessons. The germs of positivity were present from the beginning of\nthe theological stage; with Descartes, the whole of natural philosophy\nreaches the positive stage, while moral philosophy remains in the\nmetaphysical stage (1830 (58), v. 2, 714\u2013715).\n4.2 The classification of the sciences and philosophy of science\n\nThe second pillar of positive philosophy, the law of the\nclassification of the sciences, has withstood the test of time much\nbetter than the law of the three stages. Of the various\nclassifications that have been proposed, it is Comte\u2019s that is\nstill the most popular today. This classification, too, structures the\nCourse, which examines each of the six fundamental\nsciences\u2014mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology,\nsociology\u2014in turn. It provides a way to do justice to the\ndiversity of the sciences without thereby losing sight of their unity.\nThis classification also makes Comte the founder of the philosophy of\nscience in the modern sense. From Plato to Kant, reflection on science\nhad always occupied a central place in philosophy, but the sciences\nhad to be sufficiently developed for their diversity to manifest\nitself. It was thanks to his education at the \u00c9cole\nPolytechnique that Comte, from 1818, began to develop the concept of a\nphilosophy of science. At about the same time Bolzano wrote his\nWissenschaftslehre (1834) and Mill his System of\nLogic (1843), Comte\u2019s Course presented in sequence\na philosophy of mathematics, of astronomy, of physics, of chemistry,\nof biology, and of sociology. Comte\u2019s classification is meant\nnot to restore a chimerical unity, but to avoid the fragmentation of\nknowledge. Thanks to it, the sciences are related to one another in an\nencyclopedic scale that goes from the general to the particular, and\nfrom the simple to the complex: moving from mathematics to sociology,\ngenerality decreases and complexity increases.\n\nThe law of classification of the sciences also has a historical\naspect: it gives us the order in which the sciences develop. For\nexample, astronomy requires mathematics, and chemistry requires\nphysics. Each science thus rests upon the one that precedes it. As\nComte puts it, the higher depends on the lower, but is not its result.\nThe recognition of an irreducible diversity already contains a\ndisavowal of reductionism (in Comte\u2019s wording:\n\u2018materialism\u2019), which the classification allows one to\nmake explicit. The positivist clearly sees that the tendency towards\nreductionism is fed by the development of scientific knowledge itself,\nwhere each science participates in the evolution of the next; but\nhistory also teaches us that each science, in order to secure its own\nsubject matter, has to fight invasions by the preceding one.\n\u2018Thus it appears that Materialism is a danger inherent in the\nmode in which the scientific studies necessary as a preparation for\nPositivism were pursued. Each science tended to absorb the one next to\nit, on the grounds of having reached the positive stage earlier and\nmore thoroughly.\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 50; E., v. 1, 39)\n\nWhile philosophers of science have always recognized the place of\nComte in the history of their discipline, the philosophy of science\npresented in the Course, and a fortiori the one in\nthe System, have hardly been studied (Laudan 1981, Brenner\n2021). Comte\u2019s philosophy of science is based on a systematic\ndifference between method and doctrine. These are, to use Comtean\nterminology, opposed to one another, as the logical point of view and\nthe scientific point of view. Method is presented as superior to\ndoctrine: scientific doctrines change (that is what\n\u201cprogress\u201d means), but the value of science lies in its\nmethods. At the level of doctrine, mathematics has a status of its\nown, well indicated in the second lesson, where it is presented last,\nand as if to make up for something forgotten. As much as it is itself\na body of knowledge, it is an instrument of discovery in the other\nsciences, an \u2018organon\u2019 in the Aristotelian sense. Among\nthe remaining sciences, leaving sociology aside for the moment, two\noccupy a pre-eminent place:\n\nAstronomy and biology are, by their nature, the two principal branches\nof natural philosophy. They, the complement of each other, include the\ngeneral system of our fundamental conceptions in their rational\nharmony. The solar system and Man are the extremes within which our\nideas will forever be included. The system first, and then Man,\naccording to the course of our speculative reason: and the reverse in\nthe active process: the laws of the system determining those of Man,\nand remaining unaffected by them. (1830 (40), v. 1, 717\u2013718; E.,\nv. 1, 384)\n\n\nThe positive method comes in different forms, according to the science\nwhere it is applied: in astronomy it is observation, in physics\nexperimentation, in biology comparison. The same point of view is also\nbehind the general theory of hypotheses in the 28th lesson, a\ncenterpiece of the positive philosophy of science.\n\nFinally, classification is the key to a theory of technology. The\nreason is that there exists a systematic connection between complexity\nand modifiability: the more complex a phenomenon is, the more\nmodifiable it is. The order of nature is a modifiable order. Human\naction takes place within the limits fixed by nature and consists in\nreplacing the natural order by an artificial one. Comte\u2019s\neducation as an engineer had made him quite aware of the links between\nscience and its applications, which he summarized in an oft-quoted\nslogan: \u2018From science comes prevision, from prevision comes\naction\u2019. Only death prevented him from writing the System of\nPositive Industry, or Treatise on the Total Action of Humanity on the\nPlanet, announced as early as 1822.\n4.3 Sociology and its double status\n\nSociology has a double status. It is not just one science among the\nothers, as though there is the science of society just as there is a\nscience of living beings. Rather, sociology is the science that comes\nafter all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the\ntask of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge. With\nsociology, positivity takes possession of the last domain that had\nheretofore escaped it and had been considered forever inaccessible to\nit. Many people thought that social phenomena are so complex that\nthere can be no science of them. Dilthey\u2019s idea of\nGeisteswissenschaft, for instance, is explicitly directed\nagainst positivism and maintains the difference between natural\nphilosophy and moral philosophy. On the contrary, according to Comte,\nthis distinction, introduced by the Greeks, is abolished by the\nexistence of sociology, and the unity that was lost with the birth of\nmetaphysics restored (1830 (58), v. 2, 713\u2013715).\n\nFounding social science therefore constitutes a turn in the history of\nhumanity. Until then, the positive spirit was characterized by the\nobjective method, which works its way from the world to man; but as\nthis goal has now been reached, it becomes possible to invert that\ndirection and go from man to world, to adopt, in other words, the\nsubjective method, which so far had been associated with the\nanthropomorphism of theology. To legitimize that method, it suffices\nto substitute sociology for theology, \u2014 which is equivalent to\nsubstituting the relative for the absolute: whereas God may say to the\nsoul, as in the Imitatio, \u201cI am necessary to you and\nyou are useless to me\u201d,\n Humanity[3]\n is the most dependent of all beings. In the first case, to say that\nGod need us is blasphemy: it would be denying his perfection. The\nsecond case is in some respects a mere consequence of the\nclassification of sciences, if we agree to consider humanity as the\nproper object of sociology. Each science depends on the precedent; as\nthe final science, sociology is the most dependent one. Human life\ndepends for instance on astronomical conditions. Humanity depends also\non each of us, on what we do and not do; on another sense, of course,\neach of us depends on humanity, as said by the law of human order:\nles vivants sont n\u00e9cessairement et de plus en plus\ngouvern\u00e9s par les morts.\n\nTo bring out this eminent place of sociology is the principal aim of\nthe General Conclusions of the Course. The 58th\nlesson raises the question of which science presides over the others\non the encyclopedic scale. To guarantee the harmonious development of\nthe various sciences taken together, the dominance of one among them\nhas to be assumed. Until recently, that role had been played by\nmathematics, but \u2018it will not be forgotten that a cradle is not\na throne\u2019 (1830 (58), v. 2, 718; E., v. 2, 510) (Bourdeau 2004).\nOne should distinguish the first blossoming of the positive spirit\nfrom its systematic development. The human point of view, that is to\nsay, the social point of view, is the only one that is truly\nuniversal; now that sociology is born, it is up to it to be in charge\nof the development of knowledge.\n\nIt goes without saying that Comte\u2019s idea of sociology was very\ndifferent from the current one. To ensure the positivity of their\ndiscipline, sociologists have been quick to renounce its coordinating\nfunction, also known as encyclopedic or architectonic function, which\ncharacterizes philosophy. With its place at the top of the scale, the\nsociology of the Course recapitulates the whole of knowledge,\nwhile the sciences that precede it are but one immense introduction to\nthis final science. As a consequence, no one can become a sociologist\nwithout having had a solid encyclopedic education, one that has no\nplace for economics or social mathematics, but, on the contrary,\nemphasizes biology, the first science that deals with organized\nbeings. How far removed this is from today\u2019s sociology\ncurriculum!\n\nIf sociology merges at places with philosophy, it is also closely\nrelated to history. Comte was thus led to take a stand on a question\nthat deeply divides us today: how should the relations among\nphilosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science be\nseen? In the Course, history is at once everywhere and\nnowhere: it is not a discipline, but the method of sociology. Dynamic\nsociology is \u2018a history without names of men, or even of\npeople\u2019 (1830 (52), v. 2, 239). It is easy to understand, then,\nthat positivism has always refused to separate the philosophy of\nscience from the history of science. According to positivism, one does\nnot really know a science until one knows its history; indeed, it was\na chair in the general history of science that Comte had asked Guizot\nto create for him at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Mill\u2019s\nposition was not quite the same, for he took the author of the\nCourse to task for neglecting the production of proof, or, to\nuse modern vocabulary, for being more interested in the context of\ndiscovery than in the context of justification (Mill 1865). The\ncriticism is only partly legitimate: from the second lesson in the\nCourse, Comte carefully distinguishes between the doctrinal\nand the historical study of science, opting for the first while\nleaving the second for the lessons in sociology. Just as for Comte the\nphilosophy of science is not a philosophy of nature but of the mind,\nhe likewise values the history of science less as a subject in its own\nright than as the \u2018most important, yet so far most neglected\npart\u2019 of the development of Humanity (1830 (2), v. 1, 53). Each\nscience is therefore examined twice in the Course: for its\nown sake, in the first three volumes; in its relations to the general\ndevelopment of society, in the final three. In this way, Comte\nsucceeds in reconciling the internalist and externalist points of\nview, usually considered to be incompatible.\n4.4 Comte and Mill\n\nThe Course\u2019s first readers were in Great Britain; the\nreform projects of the English Radicals had many points in common with\nthe positivist concerns. A reading of the first volumes made enough of\nan impression on Mill to induce him to write to their author. The\ncorrespondence that followed, which lasted from 1841 to 1846, is of\nconsiderable philosophical interest. In his first letter, Mill\npresents himself almost as a follower of Comte and recalls how, some\nten years before, it had been Comte\u2019s 1822 work that had\nliberated him from Bentham\u2019s\n influence.[4]\n But the tone of the letters, while remaining friendly, changes\nshortly thereafter. Mill does not hesitate to voice objections to\nComte\u2019s conception of biology and his excluding psychology from\nthe sciences. In particular, Mill had strong reservations about\nGall\u2019s phrenology, which Comte endorsed, and proposed to replace\nit with ethology. Their disagreements crystallize around \u2018la\nquestion f\u00e9minine\u2019\u2014that is, the status of women in\nsociety\u2014 where it is possible to see how epistemological and\npolitical considerations are linked (Guillin 2007).\n\nAfter 1846, Mill quickly distanced himself from his correspondent. He\neven went so far to describe the Syst\u00e8me as \u201cthe\ncompletest system of spiritual and temporal despotism which ever yet\nemanated from a human brain, unless possibly that of Ignatius\nLoyola\u201d (Autobiography, 213). Such judgments\u2014and\nthere are many\u2014 represent an extreme in a much more balanced\nglobal assessment. Comte\u2019s later philosophy deserves criticism,\nbut Mill was able to see its strong points and mention them. The last\nsentences of Mill\u2019s 1865 book give a good example of the unique\nway he manages to mix approval and harsh criticism:\n\nWe think M. Comte as great as either of these philosophers [Descartes\nand Leibniz], and hardly more extravagant. Were we to speak of our\nwhole mind, we should call him superior to them: not intrinsically,\nbut by the exertion of equal intellectual power in an age less\ntolerant of palpable absurdities, and to which those he has committed,\nif not in themselves greater, at least appear more ridiculous (Mill\n1865, p. 182).\n\n\nAnd earlier, he said:\n\nWe, therefore, not only hold that M. Comte was justified in the\nattempt to develop his philosophy into a religion, and had realized\nthe essential conditions of one, but that other religions are made\nbetter in proportion as, in their practical result, they are brought\nto coincide with that which he aimed at constructing. But, unhappily,\nthe next thing we are obliged to do, is to charge him with making a\ncomplete mistake at the very outset of his operations. (Mill 1865, p.\n124)\n\n\nEven though each new edition of Mill\u2019s System of Logic\nsaw fewer references to the Course than the previous one (in\nthe first edition there had been more than a hundred), Comte\u2019s\ninfluence on Mill ran deep, the extent to which is greatly\nunderestimated today (Raeder 2002). Mill\u2019s\nAutobiography is quite explicit on this point as Comte\nfigures much more prominently in it than Tocqueville with whom Mill\nhad been in contact for a longer time. Conversely, Mill contributed\nmuch to the spreading of positivism. His book on Comte (Mill 1865)\nenjoyed considerable success, and Mill himself was sometimes\nconsidered a\n positivist.[5]\n5. The System of Positive Polity and the Complete Positivism\n\nSoon after finishing the Course, Comte returned to his\ninitial project and began outlining the System of Positive\nPolity. The Discourse on the Positive Spirit, which had\nserved as the preface to the Philosophical Treatise on Popular\nAstronomy (1844), had already emphasized the social purpose of\npositivism and its aptitude to replace theology in politics and\nmorality. But his encounter with Clotilde de Vaux would turn his life\nupside down and give Comte\u2019s second career an unexpected twist\n(1845\u20131846).\n5.1 The mind as a servant of the heart\n\nAfter Clotilde\u2019s death in 1846, positivism was transformed into\n\u201ccomplete positivism\u201d, which is \u2018continuous\ndominance of the heart\u2019 (la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance\ncontinue du Coeur). \u2018We tire of thinking and even of\nacting; we never tire of loving\u2019, as the dedication to the\nSystem put it. Positivism transformed science into\nphilosophy; complete positivism now transforms philosophy\ninto religion. The question whether such a move is consistent with\nComte\u2019s former ideas and more generally with positivism was\nasked very early. Mill and Littr\u00e9 answered negatively and\ncomplete positivism was never very popular.\n\nThe transformation of philosophy into religion does not yield a\nreligion of science because, having overcome modern prejudices, Comte\nnow unhesitatingly ranks art above science. Now that the break-up with\nthe academic world was complete, the positivists placed their hopes on\nan alliance with women and proletarians. Comte (who after\nClotilde\u2019s death obsessively, even cultishly, devoted himself to\nher) reserved a decisive role in the positive era for women (Labreure\n2020). However, this aspect of his work is difficult to accept for a\ncontemporary reader, in particular because it involves the utopian\nidea of the virgin mother, which means parthenogenesis for human\nbeings. As for the proletarians, he saw them as spontaneous\npositivists, just as the positivists were systematic proletarians!\n\nThe mind, then, is not destined to rule but to serve, not, however, as\nthe slave of the heart, but as its servant (Bourdeau 2000). Science\nthus retains an essential function. The dominance of the heart is\nfounded biologically in the \u2018positive classification of the\neighteen internal functions of the brain, or systematic view of the\nsoul\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 726; E., v. 1, 594\u201395). The cerebral\ntable distinguishes ten affective forces, five intellectual functions,\nand three practical qualities; these correspond to the heart, mind,\nand character, respectively. The functions being ordered according to\nincreasing energy and decreasing dignity, the dominance of the heart\ncan be considered a datum from positive biology. This classification\nis indispensable for an understanding of the System. It\nshould be mentioned in passing that it shows that the exclusion of\npsychology does not at all have the meaning usually given to it: Comte\nhad never refused to study man\u2019s higher functions, be they\nintellectual or moral, but for him this belongs to biology (the\nclassification is sometimes also referred to as the \u2018cerebral\ntable\u2019), and so does not require the creation of a new science\n(1830 (45)). Historically, the conception of the System began\nwith this table, of which different versions were elaborated in\nsuccession from 1846. Conceptually, it is the first application of the\nsubjective method, understood as feedback from sociology to the\nsciences that precede it, starting with the nearest. In this way, the\nsociologist helps the biologist define the cerebral functions, a task\nin which, most often, the biologist simply takes up again the\ndivisions of folk psychology. Later, in what has become known as the\n\u2018letters on illness\u2019, Comte likewise proposes a\nsociological definition of the brain, as the organ through which dead\npeople act on living ones.\n5.2 Positive Politics\n\nToday, we no longer associate positivism with politics. However, the\nconnection was present from the outset when Comte served as secretary\nof Saint-Simon, and positive politics was quite influential at the end\nof the nineteenth century. The two main tenets of positive politics\nare: there is no society without government; the proper functioning of\nsociety requires a spiritual power independent from the temporal\npower.\n\nThe first principle has two sides. The negative side expresses\nComte\u2019s lack of interest in the concept of State. The positive\nside argues we must consider how social life works in order to\nunderstand why there must be a government. Surprisingly, Comte\u2019s\nstarting point is the same as Hayek\u2019s, namely the existence of a\nspontaneous order. The title of the fiftieth lesson of the\nCourse reads: Social statics, or theory of spontaneous\norder of human society. But, for positivism, spontaneous order\ncovers all natural phenomena and is neither perfect nor immutable. In\ngeneral, human action aims to substitute natural order with an\nartificial one more in line with our desires. Government action is\nonly a special case, applied to the spontaneous order intrinsic to\nhuman society, which is determined by division of labor. Increasing\nspecialization, which accompanies division of labor, threatens the\ncohesion of society even if it is the sine qua non condition of\nprogress. That is why a government is needed: its function is\n\u2018to check the disorganizing and to foster the converging\ntendencies\u2019 of the agents (1852, 205; E. 277).\n\nRegarding the second principle: a spiritual power can only be\nunderstood in its relation to temporal power. A spiritual power, by\nnature, is a moderating power, and it presupposes the existence of a\ntemporal power, which in contrast does not presuppose the existence of\na spiritual power. Furthermore, Comte strongly disagrees with\nhistorical materialism: it is ideas that rule the world, in the sense\nthat there is no sustainable social order without a minimal consensus\non the principles that govern life in society. Initially, Comte\nplanned to entrust this new spiritual power to scientists, because he\nsaw science not only as the rational basis for our action upon nature,\nbut also as the spiritual basis of social order.\n\nFor at least the last 50 years, positive politics has been unfavorably\nviewed as reactionary and totalitarian. And it is true that, in many\nrespects, Comte was resolutely anti-modern but, especially in his\nlater writings, he also held ideas which are in keeping with\ncontemporary concerns. For instance, he had an acute feeling for the\nway humanity is dependent on astronomical conditions: assume small\nchanges in the elliptical orbit of Earth, in the inclination of\nEcliptic, and life, at least life as we know it, would have been\nimpossible. Humanity, the proper study of sociology, is closely\nconnected to the Earth, the human planet, \u2018with its gaseous and\nliquid envelopes\u2019 (Comte 1851 [1875], 429). In spite of the\nCopernican revolution, Earth remains for each of us the firm,\nunshakable ground upon which everything stands. See for instance what\nComte says about fatherland and the way \u2018the Tent, the Car or\nthe Ship are to the nomad family a sort of moveable Country,\nconnecting the Family or the Horde with its material basis, as with us\nthe [Roma] in his van\u2019 (1851, v. 2 285, E. 2 237). Politics is\ngrounded in geopolitics, where geo retains its etymological\nmeaning, Gaia, and where Earth is understood as a planet in\nthe solar system.\n\nThis cosmic character of positive politics helps to understand what\ncould appear as an inconsistency. After 1851, Comte proposed to divide\nFrance into nineteen \u2018intendances\u2019. Such a suggestion is\nquite puzzling since it is incompatible with the received view that he\nwas a supporter of centralisation. However, the inconsistency\ndisappears as soon as we take into account the distinction between\ntemporal power and spiritual power. Centralisation applies only to\nspiritual power (Comte had clearly in mind the Papacy) and temporal\npower is by nature local. There are many passages where the\ncorrelation is clearly stated. This follows from the fact that the\nmind is not limited by boundaries; a spiritual power has no choice but\nto be catholic, that is, universal. Its domain is the planet\nEarth.\n\nFrom this, we have at least two consequences. The first one is a\nstrong interest in European reconstruction, a political priority\nbetween 1815 and 1820, but not anymore in 1850, after the triumph of\nnationalism. The second one is the realization that State as a concept\nis a historical product which did not exist before 1500, and there is\nno reason to believe that States will exist for ever. Hence his\nproposal to divide France into nineteen \u2018intendances\u2019: the\nextension of temporal power is not allowed to go beyond territories\nlike Belgium or Corsica.\n\nComte was also one of the first anti-colonialists. As the place where\npositive thinking appeared and developed, Comte considered Europe a\nleader of humanity (1851 [1875], 313, Varouxakis 2017), but the way it\ntook possession of the planet in modern times contradicts the very\nidea positivism had of Europe\u2019s place in history. Much before\nsocialists, English positivists objected to Victorian imperialism (see\nClaeys 2008). In this context, Comte and his followers also discussed\nextensively the respective merits of Christianity and Islam. Turks\nwere greatly appreciative of Comte and his followers\u2019\nsecularism, which represented a solution to many of the problems of\nthe Ottoman Empire. Ahmed Reza, an influent politician, was overtly\npositivist. Atat\u00fcrk and the Young Turks were strongly influenced\nby them (Kaynar 2021).\n5.3 The religion of Humanity\n\nThe System\u2019s subtitle is Treatise on Sociology\nInstituting the Religion of Humanity. While the different forms\nof deism preserve the idea of God and dissolve religion into a vague\nreligiosity, Comte proposes exactly the contrary: a religion with\nneither God nor the supernatural. His project had little success; he\neven accomplished a tour de force by uniting both believers\nand non-believers against him. The many ridiculous details of\nComte\u2019s religion made the task of his opponents even easier. But\nthis aspect of Comte\u2019s thought deserves better than the\ndiscredit into which it has fallen (Wernick 2000; de Lubac 1945).\n\nComte defines religion as \u2018the state of complete harmony\npeculiar to human life [\u2026] when all the parts of Life are\nordered in their natural relations to each other\u2019 (1851, v. 2,\n8; E.,v. 2, 8). Comte also defines religion as a consensus, analogous\nto what health is for the body. Religion has two functions, according\nto the point of view from which one considers existence: in its moral\nfunction, religion should govern each individual; in its political\nfunction, it should unite all individuals. Religion also has three\ncomponents, corresponding to the threefold division of the cerebral\ntable: doctrine, worship, and moral rule (discipline).\nComte\u2019s discussion is mainly about the first two. If one\nconsiders the first to be related to faith and the second to love,\ntheir relation takes two forms: \u2018Love comes first and leads us\nto the faith, so long as the growth is spontaneous; but when it\nbecomes systematic, then the belief is constructed in order to\nregulate the action of love\u2019 (1852, v. 2, 152; E., v. 2, 83). At\nfirst, Comte had followed the traditional order and presented doctrine\nbefore worship, but he soon gave priority to worship, and saw this\nchange as a considerable step forward.\n\nIn the positivist religion, worship, doctrine and moral rule all have\nthe same object, namely Humanity, which must be loved, known, and\nserved. Already the General Conclusions of the\nCourse compared the concept of Humanity to that of God,\naffirming the moral superiority of the former. But only in 1847 does\nComte make the substitution explicitly; sociological synthesis comes\nto replace theological synthesis. Membership of Humanity is\nsociological, not biological. In order to belong to what is defined as\nthe continuous whole of convergent beings \u2014 Comte\u2019s term\nfor (mainly human) beings who tend to agree \u2014 one has to be\nworthy of it. All \u2018producers of dung\u2019 are excluded;\nconversely, animals that have rendered important services can be\nincluded. Strictly speaking, it is to sociology that one should turn\nfor knowledge of the laws of the human order but, as the final science\nrecapitulates all others, it is the whole encyclopedic scale\n(\u00e9chelle ; it is the result of the classification of\nsciences), that constitutes the doctrine of the new religion, which\nthereby becomes demonstrated and is no longer revealed or\ninspired.\n\nThe principal novelty of Comte\u2019s religion therefore resides in\nworship, which is both private (taking place within the family) and\npublic. The positivists set up a whole system of prayers, hymns, and\nsacraments (Wright 1986). As these were all largely inspired by\nCatholic worship, it was said that it was \u2018catholicism without\nChrist\u2019, to which the positivists replied that it was\n\u2018catholicism plus science\u2019. The best known and most\noriginal aspects of Comte\u2019s religion are found in its public\nworship, and in the positivist liturgical calendar. As Humanity\nconsists more of dead than living beings, positivism designed a whole\nsystem of commemorations, which were to develop the sense of\nHumanity\u2019s historical continuity. The most prominent form of the\nworship of Humanity is the worship of great men. Unlike the French\nrevolutionary calendar, which followed the rhythm of the seasons, the\npositivist calendar takes its inspiration from history and pays homage\nto great men and women from all nations and all times.\n\nUsually, when dealing with positivist religion, one focuses on the\nfeatures classically associated with religion, as we have just done.\nIt is then easy to miss one of its most original aspects, namely a\npurely sociological approach (Bourdeau 2020). From this point of view,\nthree types of societies must be distinguished: the family, the State\n(Greek polis, Latin Civitas), and the Church. The\nState is made up of families, the Church is made up of States. Each is\nbased on different ties: affective for the first, active for the\nsecond, and intellectual for the third. Each also has a different\nrelationship to space. Hence the necessity to separate the State and\nthe Church. The religious society is by its nature catholic, in the\nsense of universal, and therefore has no boundaries other than those\nof the planet; the surface of a State meets different demands, which\nimpose rather strict geographic limits. The contrast between French\npolitical history and English political history, which was a common\nplace in Comte\u2019s time (see for instance Tocqueville or Guizot;\nit is already present in Montesquieu and Voltaire) illustrates the\npoint: there is no separation of Church and State in Great Britain, in\nthat sense that the Queen is also the head of the Anglican Church.\nNevertheless, its main application is related to the issue:\ncentralization against local powers, which is another aspect of the\nspatial dimension of politics. Of the two political models constantly\nconfronted in the Course, Comte clearly prefers the French\none. Its characteristic alliance of the monarchy with the people\nagainst the aristocracy was accompanied by a centralization that the\nRevolution contented itself with consolidating. One might therefore be\nled to believe that Comte was a partisan of centralized political\n(that is: temporal) power, whereas the contrary was in fact the case,\nas he proposed to divide France into seventeen administrative regions,\nmore or less equivalent to the old provinces (1851, v. 4, 421; Vernon\n1984). Centralization applies only to the spiritual power.\n5.4 Ethics and sociology\n\nPositivism asserted very early its wish to construct a moral doctrine\nthat owes nothing to the supernatural. If we need a spiritual power,\nit is because social questions are quite often moral rather than\npolitical. The reforms of society must be made in a determined order:\none has to change ideas, then morals (les moeurs; the word is\ndifficult to translate: it is something like ways of acting, habits,\nles us et coutumes), and only then institutions. But with the\nSystem, the moral doctrine (ethics) changes status and\nbecomes a science, whose task is to extend sociology in order to take\nindividual phenomena into account, in particular affective ones.\n\nThe terms of the problem as well as its solution are given by a saying\nto be found in the margin of the cerebral table: \u201cAct from\naffection and think in order to act\u201d (1851, v. 1, 726; E., v. 1,\n594). The first part of this \u201csystematic verse\u201d is\nguaranteed by the dominance of the heart; but, among the ten\n\u201caffective forces\u201d, the first seven correspond to egoism,\nthe final three to altruism. The whole question is knowing which ones\nwould prevail, those of \u201cpersonality\u201d or those of\n\u201csociability\u201d. While it is important to acknowledge the\ninnateness of the sympathetic instincts, one is forced to admit their\nnative weakness: the supremacy of the egoistic tendencies is so clear\nthat it is itself one of the most striking traits in our nature. The\ngreat human problem is to reverse the natural order and to teach\nourselves to live for others.\n\nThe solution consists in \u2018regulating the inside through the\noutside\u2019 and depends, as a consequence, on a good use of the\nmind. The only way in which altruism can win, is to ally itself with\nthe mind, to make it its servant and not its slave. The heart, without\nthe light of reason, is blind. Left to itself, affectivity is\ncharacterized by its inconsistency and instability. That is why the\ninside has to be regulated, that is, disciplined. And this task is\nassigned to the outside, because exterior reality is the best of\nregulators. Whatever its own defects may be, the order that science\ndiscloses in nature is, by its indifference to our desires, a source\nof discipline. The recognition of an unchanging external order thus\nbecomes \u2018the objective base of true human wisdom\u2019, and\n\u2018in the obligation to conform themselves to it\u2019 our\naffections find \u2018a source of fixedness appropriate for\ncontrolling their spontaneous capriciousness, and a direct stimulation\nto the dominance of the sympathetic instincts\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 322;\nE., v. 1, 257). Science now finds itself vested with a moral function;\nbut that also means that \u2018thoughts must be systematized before\nfeelings\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 21; E., v. 1, 17) and that, if moral\nascendancy is the primary attribute of the spiritual power, that power\nwould not be able to carry out its duties without the aid of a\nsuperior intellect.\n\nWhile developing a science of morals founded on moral doctrine,\nDurkheim and L\u00e9vy-Bruhl were heavily dependent upon this aspect\nof the System. Like the word \u2018sociology\u2019, the\nword \u2018altruism\u2019 was coined by Comte. Being deeply aware of\nwhat man and animals have in common, Comte was close to what is known\ntoday as \u2018evolutionary ethics\u2019: he saw cooperation between\nmen as continuous with phenomena of which biology gives us further\nexamples. The same interest in biology led him to link medicine to\nmoral doctrine and even to religion. In our modern societies, the\nstudy of the human being \u2018is now irrationally parcelled out\namongst three classes of thinkers: the Physicians, who study only the\nbody; the Philosophers, who imagine to study the mind; and the\nPriests, who specially study the heart\u2019 (1852, v. 2, 437; E., v.\n2, 356). To remedy this and to respect the unity of our nature, he\nproposed giving the new clergy a role in medicine, considering for\nexample that there is no better endorsement of a rule of hygiene than\na religious decree. Before dying, he still had the time to outline, in\nhis letters to Audiffrent, the rudiments of a sociological theory of\ndiseases.\n6. Conclusion\n\nOn the whole, the System was not well received. Almost\nimmediately, Mill and Littr\u00e9 put forward the idea that there\nwere a good Comte, the author of the Course, and a bad Comte,\nthe author of the System. However, it is impossible to\nconfine oneself merely to the Course. The early works had\nmade a strong impression on some of the best minds of the time; they\nremain required reading for everyone wishing to understand positive\nphilosophy, as they are still among the best introductions to the\nsubject. The Course was not part of the initial project,\nwhich Comte never lost sight of; the work is best considered as a\nparenthesis, admittedly open for twenty years, but which Comte had\nmeant to close very quickly. The reason why Comte had always presented\nthe Plan of 1822 as fundamental is that, beginning with the\nvery title, one finds the two themes that he planned to think through\nin their relation to one another: science and society. The foremost\nquestion is a political one: how should society be reorganized?\nScience, although present from the beginning, plays a secondary role\nas the means to achieve the chosen goal. All of Comte\u2019s work\naims at the foundation of a discipline in which the study of society\nwill finally become positive, scientific. His idea of sociology is not\nquite the one we are used to today; but the current meaning of the\nterm \u2018positivism\u2019, according to which it is merely a\nphilosophy of science, is even more misleading as a clue to\nComte\u2019s thought. Even though the founder of positivism is\nrightly considered to be one of the great philosophers of science,\nalong with Poincar\u00e9 and Carnap, his natural place is elsewhere,\nalong with sociologists such as his contemporaries Marx and\nTocqueville. Only when the question arises of what distinguishes Comte\nfrom the latter does science enter into the picture.\n\nThe limits of Comte\u2019s philosophy of science are easily seen, but\nthis does not diminish its value, which remains considerable. Yet the\nsame cannot be said of the positive polity. Given that the separation\nof spiritual power and temporal power rests on the separation between\ntheory and practice, Comte abstained from any direct political action,\nand, for example, condemned Mill\u2019s decision to stand in\nparliament. But his own project for the reorganization of society\npresents a similar problem. In his writings, it is difficult to\ndistinguish that which concerns objective social science from a reform\nprogram that reflects only a personal stand.\n\nApart from that difficulty, the weaknesses of the positive polity are\nnumerous. Among them, those that are the most conspicuous (criticism\nof human rights, praise of dictatorship) are not necessarily the most\nserious, for objections to the former are easily answered. For\nexample, while Comte criticizes freedom of conscience, he is always\nhighly supportive of freedom of expression. We should also find his\ndeep respect for spontaneity reassuring, considering that it is an\nimportant part of our idea of freedom. More serious, perhaps, seem to\nbe the consequences of the rejection of psychology. The moral\nquestion, \u2018What should I do?\u2019, is no longer asked in the\nfirst person, and is transformed into an engineering problem:\n\u2018What should be done to make men more ethical?\u2019 Similarly,\nthe positivists were invited to live openly, whereby the distinction\nbetween private and public lives disappears.\n\nHowever, considering only the weaknesses of the positive polity would\nnot be fair. Even if Comte was often mistaken, his theory of\nconsensus, as well as the seriousness with which he considered the\nquestion \u2018What religion after the death of God?\u2019 (to give\nbut two examples) are likely to help us resolve certain problems\nconfronting our society. Comte\u2019s thought is resolutely oriented\ntoward the future. The order of time, he said, is not\npast-present-future, but rather past-future-present. The latter, being\nonly \u2018a vague and fleeting span which fills the interval between\ntwo immensities of duration, and binds them together [\u2026], can\nonly be properly conceived with the aid of the two extremes which it\nunites and separates\u2019 (1851, v. 2, 364; E., v. 2, 296).\n\nA sound assessment of Comte\u2019s philosophy must also take into\naccount the work of his followers, a topic that has recently received\nrenewed attention, especially for England (Wilson 2019, 2021).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<p>\nA standard edition of Comte\u2019s works does not yet exist and some\nof the most important ones (the second part of the <em>Course of\nPositive Philosophy</em>, the whole <em>System of Positive\nPolity</em>) have been unavailable for many years (in the case of the\n<em>System</em>, for more than fifty years), until recently.
