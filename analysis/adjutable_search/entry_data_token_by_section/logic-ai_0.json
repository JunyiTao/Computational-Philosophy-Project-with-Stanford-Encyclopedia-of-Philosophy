Logic and Artificial Intelligence\n1.1 The Role of Logic in Artificial Intelligence\n\n\nTheoretical computer science developed out of logic, the theory of\ncomputation (if this is to be considered a different subject from\nlogic), and some related areas of\n mathematics.[4]\n So theoretically minded\ncomputer scientists are well informed about logic even when they aren\u2019t\nlogicians. Computer scientists in general are familiar with the idea\nthat logic provides techniques for analyzing the inferential properties\nof languages, and with the distinction between a high-level logical\nanalysis of a reasoning problem and its implementations. Logic, for\ninstance, can provide a specification for a programming language by\ncharacterizing a mapping from programs to the computations that they\nlicense. A compiler that implements the language can be incomplete, or\neven unsound, as long as in some sense it approximates the logical\nspecification. This makes it possible for the involvement of logic in\nAI applications to vary from relatively weak uses in which the logic\ninforms the implementation process with analytic insights, to strong\nuses in which the implementation algorithm can be shown to be sound and\ncomplete. In some cases, a working system is inspired by ideas from\nlogic and then acquires features that at first seem logically problematic\nbut can later be explained by developing new ideas in logical theory.\nThis sort of thing has happened, for instance, in logic\nprogramming.\n\n\nIn particular, logical theories in AI are independent from\nimplementations. They can be used to provide insights into the\nreasoning problem without directly informing the implementation. Direct\nimplementations of ideas from logic\u2014theorem-proving and\nmodel-construction techniques\u2014are used in AI, but the AI theorists who\nrely on logic to model their problem areas are free to use other\nimplementation techniques as well. Thus, in\n Moore 1995b\n (Chapter\u00a01), Robert C.\nMoore distinguishes three uses of logic in AI; as a tool of analysis,\nas a basis for knowledge representation, and as a programming\nlanguage.\n\n\nA large part of the effort of developing limited-objective reasoning\nsystems goes into the management of large, complex bodies of\ndeclarative information. It is generally recognized in AI that it is\nimportant to treat the representation of this information, and the\nreasoning that goes along with it, as a separate task, with its own\nresearch problems.\n\n\nThe evolution of expert systems illustrates the point. The earliest\nexpert systems, such as MYCIN (a program that reasons\nabout bacterial infections, see\n Buchanan & Shortliffe 1984),\nwere based entirely on large systems of procedural rules, with no\nseparate representation of the background knowledge\u2014for instance, the\ntaxonomy of the infectious organisms about which the system reasoned\nwas not represented.\n\n\nLater generation expert systems show a greater modularity in their\ndesign. A separate knowledge representation component is useful for\nsoftware engineering purposes\u2014it is much better to have a single\nrepresentation of a general fact that can have many different uses,\nsince this makes the system easier to develop and to modify. And this\ndesign turns out to be essential in enabling these systems to deliver\nexplanations as well as mere\n conclusions.[5]\n1.2 Knowledge Representation\n\n\nIn response to the need to design this declarative component, a\nsubfield of AI known as knowledge representation emerged\nduring the 1980s. Knowledge representation deals primarily with the\nrepresentational and reasoning challenges of this separate component.\nThe best place to get a feel for this subject is the proceedings of the\nmeetings that are now held every other year: see\n Brachman et al. 1989,\n Allen et al. 1991,\n Nebel et al. 1992,\n Doyle et al. 1994,\n Aiello et al. 1996,\n Cohn et al. 1998,\n Cohn et al. 2000,\n Fensel et al. 2002,\n Dubois et al. 2004,\n Doherty et al. 2006,\n Brewka & Lang 2008,\n Lin et al. 2010,\n Eiter et al. 2012,\n Baral et al. 2012,\n and\n Baral et al. 2016.\n\n\nTypical articles in the proceedings of the KR and Reasoning\nconferences deal with the following topics.\n\nTopics in logical theory and the theory of computation, including \n\n \nNonmonotonic logic\nComplexity theory\n\nStudies in application areas, including \n\n \nTemporal reasoning\nFormalisms for reasoning about planning, action and change, and causality\nMetareasoning\nReasoning about context\nReasoning about values and desires\nReasoning about the mental states of other agents, and especially\nabout knowledge and belief\nSpatial reasoning\nReasoning about vagueness\n\nArgumentation and argumentation theory\nAggregation problems of many kinds, such as the integration of\n\tconflicting knowledge sources\nStudies in application techniques, including \n\n \nLogic programming\nDescription logics\nTheorem proving\nModel construction\n\n\nStudies of large-scale applications, including \n\n \nCognitive robotics\nMerging, updating, and correcting knowledge bases\n\n\n\n\nThese topics hardly overlap at all with the contents of the Journal\nof Symbolic Logic, the principal research archive for mathematical\nlogic. But there is substantial overlap in theoretical emphasis with\nThe Journal of Philosophical Logic, where topics such as tense\nlogic, epistemic logic, logical approaches to practical reasoning,\nbelief change, and vagueness account for a large percentage of the\ncontributions. Very few JPL publications, however, deal with\ncomplexity theory or with potential applications to automated\nreasoning. \n1.3 Philosophical Logic\n\n\nA history of philosophical logic is yet to be written.  \nThough philosophical logic has traditionally been distinguised from\nmathematical logic, the distinction may well be incidental in relation\nto the overall goals of the subject, since technical rigor and the use\nof mathematical methods seem to be essential in all areas of logical\nresearch. However, the distinction between the two subfields has been\nmagnified by differences in the sorts of professional training that\nare available to logicians, and by the views of individuals on what is\nimportant for the field. \n\n\nThe statement of policy presented in\nJournal of Symbolic Logic (1936, Volume 1, No. 1) lists\nbringing together the mathematicians and philosophers working in logic\namong the goals of the new journal. Probably at this time both the\nmathematicians and the philosophers shared a sense that their subject\nwas considered to be somewhat marginal by their colleagues, and may\nhave felt a primary loyalty to logic as a subject rather than to any\nacademic discipline.  Articles in the first volume of the JSL\nwere divided about equally between professional mathematicians and\nphilosophers, and the early volumes of the JSL do not show\nany strong differences between the two groups as to topic.\n\n\nThis situation changed in the 1960s. The 1969 volume of the\nJSL contained 39 articles by mathematicians, and only nine by\nphilosophers. By the early 1970s, many philosophers felt that\nphilosophical papers on logic were unlikely to be accepted by the\nJSL, and that if they were accepted they were unlikely to be\nread by philosophers. At this point, the goals of the two groups had\ndiverged considerably. Mathematicians were pursuing the development of\nan increasingly technical and complex body of methods and theorems.\nMany philosophers felt that this pursuit was increasingly irrelevant to\nthe goal of illuminating philosophical issues. These divisions led to\nthe founding of the Journal of Philosophical Logic in 1972.\nThe list of sample topics in the first issue included:\n\nContributions to branches of logical theory directly related to\nphilosophical concerns, such as inductive logic, modal logic, deontic\nlogic, quantum logic, tense logic, free logic, logic of questions,\nlogic of commands, logic of preference, logic of conditionals,\nmany-valued logic, relevance logics;\nContributions to philosophical discussions that utilize the\nmachinery of formal logic \u2026;\nDiscussions of philosophical issues relating to logic and the\nlogical structure of language, \u2026;\nPhilosophical work relating to the special sciences, \u2026.\n\n\n\nMost of the articles over the subsequent 28 years of the JPL\nbelong to the first of these four categories. But the description with\nwhich this list begins is not particularly illuminating: why should\nthese particular topics be of interest to philosophers? Their most\nimportant shared feature is a sense that despite successes in\nformalizing areas of mathematical logic, the scope of logic remained\nseverely limited. There are unsolved problems in formalizing the\nnonmathematical sciences that seem to require thinking through new and\ndifferent logical issues (quantum logic and the logic of induction,\nfor instance). The remaining topics cover a part, at least, of the\neven more pressing problems involved in extending logical theory to\nnonscientific reasoning. The dominant goal, then, of philosophical\nlogic is the extension of logical methods to nonmathematical reasoning\ndomains. This goal has a theoretical dimension if (as many\nphilosophical logicians seem to feel) it requires reworking and\nextending logical formalisms. \n\n\nThe development and testing of applications, such as the problem of\nformalizing the reasoning involved in getting to the airport, posed as\na challenge in\n McCarthy 1959\n (see\n Section 2.2,\n below), doesn\u2019t even appear as a\ncategory in the list of JPL topics, and in fact most of the\nphilosophical logic literature is theoretical in nature, and is tested\nusing philosophical techniques. Essentially, this means that the\ntheories are motivated and tested with small-scale, artificial\nexamples, selected by the theoreticians. These examples usually serve\nmore as demonstrations or illustrations than as tests.\n1.4 Logic in AI and Philosophical Logic\n\n\nThe rough comparison in\n Section 1.2\n of the\ncontents of the main publications for research in logical AI and\nphilosophical logic suggests the following picture. Theoretical work in\nlogical AI and in philosophical logic overlap to a large extent. Both\nare interested in developing nonmetamathematical applications of logic,\nand the core topics are very similar. This overlap is due not only to\ncommonality of interest, but to direct influence of philosophical logic\non logical AI; there is ample evidence, as we will see, that the first\ngeneration at least of AI logicists read and were influenced by the\nliterature in philosophical logic.\n\n\nSince that point, the specialties have diverged. New logical\ntheories have emerged in logical AI (nonmonotonic logic is the most\nimportant example) which are not widely known in philosophical logic.\nOther differences are due to the AI community\u2019s interest in the\ntheoretical analysis of algorithms and, of course, with their sense of\nthe importance of implementations. Some have to do with the emerging\ndevelopment in computer science of ambitious applications using\nunprecedentedly large bodies of logical axioms. The sheer size of these\napplications produces new problems and new methodologies. And other\ndifferences originate in the interest of philosophical logicians in\nsome topics (metaphysical topics, for instance) that are primarily\ninspired by purely philosophical considerations.\n\n\nConcern for applications can be a great influence on how research is\ncarried out and presented. The tradition in philosophical logic\npredates applications in automated reasoning, and to this day remains\nrelatively uninterested in such applications. The methodology depends\non intuitions, but without any generally accepted methodology for\narticulating and deploying these intuitions. And the ideas are\nillustrated and informed by artificial, small-scale\n examples.[6]\n In general,\nthe philosophical literature does not deal with implementability or\nefficiency of the reasoning, or indeed with any features of the\nreasoning process. And it is hard to find cases in which the\nphilosophical theories are illustrated or tested with realistic,\nlarge-scale reasoning problems.\n\n\nThese differences, however, are much more a matter of style than of\nsubstance or of strategic research goals. It is difficult to think\nthrough the details of the reasoning process without the computational\ntools to make the process concrete, and difficult to develop\nlarge-scale formalizations of reasoning problems without computational\ntools for entering, testing, and maintaining the formalizations.\nBecause the core theoretical topics (modal, conditional and temporal\nlogic, belief revision, and the logic of context) are so similar, and\nbecause the ultimate goal (the formalization of nonmathematical\nreasoning) is the same, one can see logic in AI as a continuous\nextension of the philosophical logic tradition.\n\n\nThe early influence of philosophical logic on logic in AI was\nprofound. The bibliography of\n McCarthy & Hayes 1969,\n one\nof the most influential early papers in logical AI, illustrates the\npoint well. There are 58 citations in the bibliography. Of these, 35\nrefer to the philosophical logic literature. (There are 17 computer\nscience citations, one mathematical logic citation, one economics\ncitation, and one psychology citation.) This paper was written at a\ntime when there were hardly any references to logical AI in the\ncomputer science literature. Naturally, as logical AI has matured and\ndeveloped as a branch of computer science, the proportion of\ncross-disciplinary citations has decreased. A sampling of articles from\nthe first Knowledge Representation conference,\n Brachman et al. 1989,\n held in\n1989, shows only 12 philosophical logic citations out of a total of 522\nsampled citations; a sampling of articles from\n Cohn et al. 1998,\n held in 1998,\nshows 23 philosophical logic citations out of a total of 468\nsampled.[7]\n\n\nDespite the dramatic decrease in quantity of explicit citations, the\ncontemporary literature in logical AI reflects an indirect acquaintance\nwith the earlier literature in philosophical logic, since many of the\ncomputational papers that are explicitly cited in the modern works were\ninfluenced by this literature. Of course, the influence becomes\nincreasingly distant as time passes, and this trend is accelerated by\nthe fact that new theoretical topics have been invented in logical AI\nthat were at best only dimly prefigured in the philosophical\nliterature.\n\n\nAlthough philosophical logic is now a relatively small field in\ncomparison to logical AI, it remains a viable area of research, with new\nwork appearing regularly. But references to contemporary research in\nphilosophical logic are rare in the AI literature. Similarly, the\npapers currently published in The Journal of Philosophical\nLogic, at least, do not show much influence from\n AI.[8]\n In Europe,\nthe lines are harder to draw between professional divisions among\nlogicians: some European journals, especially the Journal of Logic,\nLanguage, and Information, are successful in maintaining a focus\nin logic while attracting authors from all the disciplines in which\nlogic is represented.\n1.5 The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Logic\n\n\nThe importance of applications in logical AI, and the scale of these\napplications, represents a new methodology for logic\u2014one that would\nhave been impossible without mechanized reasoning. This methodology\nforces theoreticians to think through problems on a new scale and at a\nnew level of detail, and this in turn has a profound effect on the\nresulting theories. The effects of this methodology will be illustrated\nin the sections below, dealing with various topics in logical AI. But\nthe point is illustrated well by reasoning about action and change.\nThis topic was investigated in the philosophical literature. Reasoning\nabout change, at least, is part of tense logic, and the consequences of\naction are investigated in the literature on \u201cseeing to it that\u201d; see,\nfor instance,\n Belnap 1996.\n The latter\ntheory has no very robust account of action. The central construct is a\nvariation on a branching-time modality of the sort that has been\nfamiliar since\n Prior 1967.\n Although it\nrepresents an interesting development in philosophical logic, the scale\nof the accomplishment is very different from the research tradition in\nlogical AI reported in\n Section 4,\n below. The\nformalisms in this tradition not only support the formalization of\ncomplex, realistic planning problems, but provide entirely new insights\ninto reasoning about the causal effects of actions, the persistence of\nstates, and the interactions between actions and continuous physical\nprocesses. Developments such as this would have been impossible without\nthe interactions between the logical theories and large-scale,\npractical applications in automated planning.\n\n\nIn\n Carnap 1955,\n Rudolf Carnap attempted\nto clarify intensional analyses of linguistic meaning, and to justify\nfrom a methodological point of view, by imagining how the analysis\ncould be applied to the linguistic usage of a hypothetical robot.\nCarnap hoped that the fact that we could imagine ourselves to know the\ninternal structure of the robot would help to make the case for an\nempirical science of semantics more plausible. This hope proved to be\nunjustified; the philosophical issue that concerned Carnap remains\ncontroversial to this day, and thought experiments with robots have not\nproved to be particularly rewarding in addressing it. Real robots,\nthough, with real\n applications,[9]\n are a very different matter. Though it\nis hard to tell whether they will prove to be helpful in clarifying\nfundamental philosophical problems, they provide a laboratory for logic\nthat is revolutionary in its potential impact on the subject. They\nmotivate the development of entirely new logical theories that should\nprove to be as important for philosophy as the fundamental\ndevelopments in logic of the late nineteenth century proved to be.\n\n\nThe emergence of separate mathematical and philosophical\nsubspecialties within logic was not an entirely healthy thing for the\nfield. The process of making mathematical logic rigorous and of\ndemonstrating the usefulness of the techniques in achieving mathematical\nends that was pursued so successfully in the first half of the\ntwentieth century represents a coherent refinement of logical\nmethodology. All logicians should be pleased and proud that logic is\nnow an area with a body of results and problems that is as substantial\nand challenging as those associated with most areas of mathematics.\n\n\nBut these methodological advances were gained at the expense of\ncoverage. In the final analysis, logic deals with reasoning\u2014and\nrelatively little of the reasoning we do is mathematical, while almost\nall of the mathematical reasoning that nonmathematicians do is mere\ncalculation. To have both rigor and scope, logic needs to keep its\nmathematical and its philosophical side united in a single discipline.\nIn recent years, neither the mathematical nor the philosophical\nprofessions\u2014and this is especially true in the United\nStates\u2014have done a great deal to promote this unity. But the\nneeds of Computer Science provide strong unifying motives. The\nprofessional standards for logical research in Computer Science\ncertainly require rigor, but the field also puts its practitioners into\ncontact with reasoning domains that are not strictly mathematical, and\ncreates needs for innovative logical theorizing.\n\n\nThe most innovative and ambitious area of Computer Science, in terms\nof its coverage of reasoning, and the one that is closest in spirit to\nphilosophical logic, is AI. This article will attempt to provide an\nintroduction, for outsiders who are familiar with logic, to the aspects\nof AI that are closest to the philosophical logic tradition. This area\nof logic deserves, and urgently needs, to be studied by historians.  But\nsuch a study will not be found here.\n",
