Various Versions of the Problem of Evil in Leibniz\n\n\nBefore examining Leibniz's views on the problem of evil, it is\nnecessary to do some stage-setting in order to locate just what sort\nof problem Leibniz thought evil presented. Consideration of any\npresent-day introductory textbook of philosophy reveals that the\nproblem of evil in contemporary philosophy is standardly regarded as\nan argument for atheism. The atheist contends that God and evil are\nincompatible, and given that evil clearly exists, God cannot\nexist. Some philosophers, conceding that the claimed incompatibility\nin the foregoing argument is too strong, contend, nevertheless, that\neven if the existence of God and the existence of evil should prove to\nbe compatible, the existence (or duration, or amount, or\npervasiveness) of evil provides us at the very least with compelling\ncircumstantial evidence that God does not exist.\n\n\nFramed in this way, the \u201catheistic problem of evil\u201d\ninvites certain sorts of responses. In particular, it invites the\ntheist to explain how a being that is omniscient, omnibenevolent, and\nomnipotent can allow evil to exist.  Present-day responses to the\nproblem of evil therefore focus largely on presenting\n\u201ctheodicies,\u201d that is, reasons why a perfect being does or\nmight permit evil of the sort (or duration, or amount, or\ndistribution) that we find in our world to exist.\n\n\nWhen we consider, however, the works of medieval philosophers who\naddress the problem of evil, the \u201catheistic problem\u201d is\nnot to be found. Since these figures believed that the arguments of\nnatural theology demonstrated the existence of God, the problem that\nevil presented for them was different from that engaged by present-day\nphilosophers. In present-day terminology, medieval philosophers did\nnot engage the \u201cevidential\u201d problem of evil: rather, they\nengaged the \u201caporetic\u201d problem of evil, in order to try to\nresolve the apparent logical incompatibility between God's attributes\nand the existence of evil.  [On the distinction between these\nproblems, see Adams and Adams (1990), pp. 1\u20133.]  The problem,\ntherefore, was taken to be that of explaining the compatibility of the\nexistence of evil with divine moral purity or holiness. These\nphilosophers believed that God is the author of everything that\nexists, and given that evil is one of the things that exists, it might\nseem that God is therefore the author of evil. And if an agent is an\n\u201cauthor of evil,\u201d he is therefore implicated in the evil\nand cannot be morally pure or holy. Thus, God cannot be morally pure\nnor holy. Let's call this version of the problem of evil the\n\u201choliness problem.\u201d Before moving on, it should be noted\nthat in light of the fact that Leibniz and his predecessors shared a\ncommitment to God's existence, one might think that their approach to\nthe problem of evil begs the question against the atheistic critic who\ncharges that the existence of evil provides evidence that God does not\nexist.  But this issue simply did not arise for Leibniz and his\npredecessors, given their antecedent belief in God's existence, and\ntherefore it is inappropriate to charge these philosophers with\nbegging the question.\n\n\nTraditional theists held\u2013\u2013and present-day theists still do\nhold\u2013\u2013that God is the \u201cauthor\u201d or cause of\neverything in the cosmos in at least three different respects, so\ndiscussions of the holiness problem often branch off in three\ncorrespondingly different directions. First, God is regarded as the\ncreative cause of everything in the cosmos. Everything that\nexists contingently is brought into existence by means of the creative\nactivity of God. Second, it is held that God is the conserving cause of\neverything that exists. So God not only creates every created being, but every created\nbeing that continues to exist does so in virtue of God's continuously\nmaintaining it in existence. Third, every action caused by a\ncreated being requires direct divine activity as concurrent\ncause.  So every whack of a hammer, every strike of my fingertip\non the keyboard, every tug of a magnet on a piece of iron, requires\nnot only that the created being act, but also that the creator act\nconcurrently with the created being in order to bring about the\nparticular effect of the cause in question.  [For a classic exposition\nof these various modes of divine causal involvement see St. Thomas\nAquinas, Disputationes de Potentia Dei, Q.3, a.7, resp.]\n\n\nGiven that on this traditional account, God is intimately intertwined\nwith the workings of the cosmos, the holiness problem seemed all the\nmore intractable. In light of the intimate connections between God and\nthe created world, the problem is not just that God created a world\nthat happens to include evil, but that God seems to be causally (and\nthus morally) implicated in, for example, every particular act of\nmurder, every earthquake, and every death caused by\nplague. Consequently, responses to the holiness problem sought to\nexplain not only how God could remain holy despite\nhaving created a world such as ours, but also how he could\nremain holy despite conserving the world in existence and\ncausally cooperating with all the events that occur in it.\n\n\nIn light of the fact that Leibniz lived in between these two eras,\neras in which evil was taken to present different problems for the\nmonotheistic philosopher, we are immediately led to wonder what sort\nof problem he sought to address. Leibniz expends a great deal of\neffort attempting to solve the holiness problem, but he also takes up\nsomething akin to the atheistic problem. It would be anachronistic,\nhowever, to claim that Leibniz was engaged with the atheistic problem,\nfor in his time the existence of evil was taken to be an argument for\nan unorthodox form of theism rather than an argument for\natheism. Thus, for example, a group of thinkers collectively known as\nthe \u201cSocinians\u201d held, among other things, that the\nexistence of evil was not incompatible with God's existence,\nbut that it was incompatible with the existence of an\nomniscient God. The Socinians therefore held that God must\nnot be omniscient, and that he must at the very least lack knowledge\nof future contingent events. [For Leibniz's view on the Socinians\nsee Theodicy 364 (H343; G VI 318) et passim. More\ndetails on Socinianism can be found in Jolley, c.2, and\nMaclachlan.]\n\n\nWe might then characterize the problem raised by atheists in our own\ncentury and by the Socinians, to cite just one example from the\nseventeenth century, more broadly as the \u201cunderachiever\nproblem.\u201d According to the underachiever problem, if the sort of\nbeing that traditional monotheism identifies as God were to exist, the\nexistence of this world would represent a vast underachievement on his\npart: therefore there is no such being. Atheists take this conclusion\nto prove that there is no God; the Socinians take it to show that God\nis not the sort of being that the traditional theist supposes him to\nbe.\n\n\nAlthough Leibniz is concerned about the underachiever\nproblem, it is the Socinian, and not the atheistic, version of the\nproblem that he engages. The winds of atheism had\nnot reached the gale force proportions that they would in succeeding\ncenturies. Consequently, this stronger conclusion was not yet taken as a\nserious, or at least the main, threat presented by the existence of evil.\n\n\nIt is important to distinguish between these versions of the problem\nof evil since we cannot understand Leibniz's treatment of evil in a\ngiven text until we know what problem it is that he means to be\naddressing in that text. Having set the stage in this way, we can now\nconsider Leibniz's solutions to the problem of evil: we first consider\nthe underachiever problem, and then turn to the holiness problem.\n",
