The general idea is that the\nnature of the actual world (i.e. the universe and everything in it)\nconforms to a certain condition, the condition of being physical. Of\ncourse, physicalists don\u2019t deny that the world might contain\nmany items that at first glance don\u2019t seem physical \u2014\nitems of a biological, or psychological, or moral, or social, or\nmathematical nature. But they insist nevertheless that at the end of\nthe day such items are physical, or at least bear an important\nrelation to the physical.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Preliminaries\n1.1 Terminology\n\nPhysicalism is sometimes known as \u2018materialism\u2019. Indeed,\non one strand to contemporary usage, the terms\n\u2018physicalism\u2019 and \u2018materialism\u2019 are\ninterchangeable. But the two terms have very different histories. The\nword \u2018materialism\u2019 appears in English towards the end of\nthe 17th century, but the word \u2018physicalism\u2019 was\nintroduced into philosophy only in the 1930s by\n Otto Neurath\n (1931) and\n Rudolf Carnap\n (1959/1932), both of whom were key members of the Vienna Circle, a\ngroup of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians active in Vienna\nprior to World War II. While it is not clear that Neurath and Carnap\nunderstood physicalism in the same way, one thesis often attributed to\nthem (e.g. in Hempel 1949) is the linguistic thesis that every\nstatement is synonymous with (i.e. is equivalent in meaning with) some\nphysical statement. But materialism as traditionally construed is not\na linguistic thesis at all; rather it is a metaphysical thesis in the\nsense that it tells us about the nature of the world. At least for the\npositivists, therefore, there was a clear reason for distinguishing\nphysicalism (a linguistic thesis) from materialism (a metaphysical\nthesis). Moreover, this reason was compounded by the fact that,\naccording to official positivist doctrine, metaphysics is nonsense.\nSince the 1930s, however, the positivist philosophy that under-girded\nthis distinction has for the most part been rejected\u2014for\nexample, physicalism is not a linguistic thesis for contemporary\nphilosophers\u2014and this is one reason why the words\n\u2018materialism\u2019 and \u2018physicalism\u2019 are now often\ninterpreted as interchangeable. \n\nSome philosophers suggest that \u2018physicalism\u2019 is distinct\nfrom \u2018materialism\u2019 for a reason quite unrelated to the one\nemphasized by Neurath and Carnap. As the name suggests, materialists\nhistorically held that everything was matter \u2014 where matter was\nconceived as \u201can inert, senseless substance, in which extension,\nfigure, and motion do actually subsist\u201d (Berkeley, Principles of\nHuman Knowledge, par. 9). But physics itself has shown that not\neverything is matter in this sense; for example, forces such as\ngravity are physical but it is not clear that they are material in the\ntraditional sense (Lange 1865, Dijksterhuis 1961, Yolton 1983). So it\nis tempting to use \u2018physicalism\u2019 to distance oneself from\nwhat seems a historically important but no longer scientifically\nrelevant thesis of materialism, and related to this, to emphasize a\nconnection to physics and the physical sciences. However, while\nphysicalism is certainly unusual among metaphysical doctrines in being\nassociated with a commitment both to the sciences and to a particular\nbranch of science, namely physics, it is not clear that this is a good\nreason for calling it \u2018physicalism\u2019 rather than\n\u2018materialism.\u2019 For one thing, many contemporary\nphysicalists do in fact use the word \u2018materialism\u2019 to\ndescribe their doctrine (e.g. Smart 1963). Moreover, while\n\u2018physicalism\u2019 is no doubt related to \u2018physics\u2019\nit is also related to \u2018physical object\u2019 and this in turn\nis very closely connected with \u2018material object\u2019, and via\nthat, with \u2018matter.\u2019 \n\nIn this entry, I will adopt the policy of using both terms\ninterchangeably, though I will typically refer to the thesis we will\ndiscuss as \u2018physicalism\u2019. It is important to note, though,\nthat physicalism (aka materialism) is often associated with a number\nof further doctrines distinct from the one we will focus on; for a\ndiscussion of some of these, see the supplement on:\n\nPhysicalism and Associated Doctrines\n\n1.2 Historical Issues\n\nSetting aside what it is properly called, the thesis of physicalism is\noften described as an extremely old, even ancient, thesis. The first\nsentence of\n Friedrich Lange\u2019s\n The History of Materialism, which was the standard work on the\nsubject in the 19th century is: \u201cMaterialism is as old as philosophy,\nbut not older\u201d (1925, 3). What Lange has in mind is the pre-Socratic\nphilosopher\n Democritus,\n who is usually thought of defending a kind of physicalism or\nmaterialism when he said or allegedly said, \u201call is atoms and the\nvoid.\u201d This view casts a long shadow over subsequent formulations of\nphysicalism. A position like that of Democritus was revived in the\nearly modern period just prior to Newton, by philosophers and\nscientists such as\n Hobbes\n or\n Gassendi.\n In the eighteenth century, French philosophers like\n D\u2019Holbach\n and La Mettrie thought of themselves as materialists (and would be\nnow classified as physicalists) somewhat in the same way since they\nheld that each human being is a complicated sort of machine. In the\nnineteenth century, while\n Karl Marx\u2019s\n \u2018dialectical materialism\u2019 is something different from the\nmetaphysical thesis we will focus on, he nevertheless developed his\nsocial philosophy against the background of what we would call\nphysicalism; in fact, Marx\u2019s doctoral dissertation was a comparison of\nDemocritus and\n Epicurus.  And in the twentieth century,\n analytic philosophers such as Smart and Lewis self-consciously\n defended their views in a way that acknowledges, as Lewis put it,\n \u201cour intellectual ancestors\u201d (1994, 293).\n\nHowever, while there is certainly something in common here, the\nunderlying historical issues are extremely complicated, since they\ninvolve subtle questions of scientific and philosophical change. We\nwon\u2019t discuss them in detail in this entry. It is worth emphasis,\nthough, that we should be careful in lumping different people in\ndifferent epochs together. The precise views they held are often\ndifferent from one another. As we noted above, and as Lange himself\nemphasises, Newton did not think that, even in the physical world, all\nis atoms and the void, since for him there are also forces such as\ngravity. It follows that any post-Newtonian philosophers who think of\nthemselves as physicalists must have a different thesis in mind from\nDemocritus.\n1.3 A Framework for Discussion\n\nIn approaching the topic of physicalism, one may distinguish what I\nwill call the interpretation question from the truth\nquestion. The interpretation question asks: \n\nWhat does it mean to say that everything is\nphysical?\n\n\nThe truth question asks: \n\nIs it true to say that everything is physical?\n\n\nThere is obviously a sense in which the second question presupposes an\nanswer to the first \u2014 you need to know what a statement means\nbefore you can ask whether it\u2019s true \u2014 and so we will\nbegin with the interpretation question. \n\nThe interpretation question itself divides into two sub-questions,\nwhich I will call the condition question and the\ncompleteness question. The condition question asks:\n\nWhat does it mean to for something to be\nphysical?\n\n\nThe condition question holds fixed the issue of what it means for\neverything to satisfy some condition, or to bear a relation to\nsomething that satisfies that condition, and asks instead\nwhat is the condition, being physical, that\neverything satisfies or bears a relation to. Notice that a parallel\nquestion could be asked of Thales: what is the condition, being\nwater, that according to Thales, everything satisfies?\nThe completeness question asks:\n\nWhat relation or relations must obtain between everything\nand the physical if physicalism is to be true?\n\n\nIn other words, the completeness question holds fixed the issue of\nwhat it means for something to be physical, and asks instead what\nrelation or relations obtain between everything and the physical if\nphysicalism is true; in what sense, in other words, is physicalism a\ncomplete thesis, a thesis that applies to everything\nwhatsoever. Notice again that a parallel question could be asked of\nThales: assuming we know what condition you have to satisfy to be\nwater, what does it mean to say that everything satisfies that\ncondition? \n\nOnce again there is a sense in which the second question here\npresupposes an answer to the first \u2014 you need to know what it is\nfor something to be physical in order to assess different proposals\nabout the relation everything bears to the physical.  Nevertheless, it\nis easier from a presentational point of view to discuss the\ncompleteness question first, leaving our answer to the condition\nquestion for the moment impressionistic, and that will be our\nprocedure. \n2. The Completeness Question\n\nHow should we approach the completeness question? In the history of\nattempts to answer this question, people have tended to adopt one of\ntwo strategies. One appeals to (what philosophers call) modal\nnotions, where a modal notion here means a notion connected to\npossibility and necessity, to what might or must be the case. Another\nappeals to non-modal notions, that is, notions distinct from\nideas about possibility and necessity. There is a wide variety of such\nnotions, though perhaps the most obvious one is identity in\nthe logical sense, according to which if x is identical to y, then\nevery property of x is a property of y. This notion has consequences\nfor possibility and necessity, but it is not itself modal. Other\nnon-modal notions include realization, or grounding,\nwhich we will consider below.\n\nIn practice, most formulations of physicalism include both\nmodal and non-modal elements at some level. Proponents of modal\nformulations often end up appealing to something non-modal in the\ncourse of elaborating and defending their view. Non-modal versions are\nusually interpreted so that they have the same modal consequences as\nmodal versions. Nevertheless, the issue of whether to answer the\ncompleteness question by appealing to modal or non-modal ideas has\nproved as controversial as any in the literature on what physicalism\nis (for overviews, see Rabin 2020, Elpidorou 2018a, Tiehen 2018). In\nwhat follows, we will first look at an influential modal answer to the\ncompleteness question, which appeals to supervenience, and\nthen turn to several non-modal alternatives.\n2.1 Supervenience and Necessity Physicalism\n\nThe idea of supervenience has its origins in meta-ethics but was\nimported into philosophy of mind mainly by Davidson 1970; for a\nsurvey, see\n supervenience.\n For our purposes, the general idea might be introduced via an example\ndue to David Lewis of a dot-matrix picture:\n\nA dot-matrix picture has global properties \u2014 it is symmetrical,\nit is cluttered, and whatnot \u2014 and yet all there is to the\npicture is dots and non-dots at each point of the matrix. The global\nproperties are nothing but patterns in the dots. They supervene: no\ntwo pictures could differ in their global properties without\ndiffering, somewhere, in whether there is or there isn\u2019t a dot\n(1986, p. 14).\n\n\nThis gives us one way to think about the basic idea of physicalism.\nThe basic idea is that the physical features of the world are like the\ndots in the picture, and the psychological or biological or social\nfeatures of the world are like the global properties of the picture.\nJust as the global features of the picture supervene on the dots, so\ntoo everything supervenes on the physical, if physicalism is true.\n\nIt is desirable to have a more explicit statement of physicalism, and\nhere too Lewis\u2019s example gives us direction. He says that, in\nthe case of the picture, supervenience means that \u201cno two\npictures can be identical in the arrangement of dots but different in\ntheir global properties\u201d. Similarly, one might say that, in the\ncase of physicalism, no two possible worlds can be identical in their\nphysical properties but differ, somewhere, in their mental, social or\nbiological properties. To weaken this slightly, we might say that if\nphysicalism is the case at our world \u2013 that is, is true of\nour universe and everything in it \u2013 then no other world can\nbe physically identical to our world without being identical to it in\nall respects. This suggests the following general account of what\nphysicalism is (in the following formulation and in subsequent ones,\nwe use \u201ciff\u201d to abbreviate \u201cif and only\nif\u201d):\n\n(1)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff any world\nwhich is a physical duplicate of w is a duplicate of\nw simpliciter.\n\n\nIf physicalism is construed along the lines suggested in (1), we have\nan answer to the completeness question. The completeness question\nasks: what relation does everything bear to the physical if\nphysicalism is true?  According to (1), the answer is that everything\nmust supervene on the physical; or, to put it more technically, there\nis no possible world which is identical to our world in every physical\nrespect but which is not identical to it in a biological or social or\npsychological respect. It will be useful to have a name for\nphysicalism so defined, so let us call it supervenience\nphysicalism. \n\nSupervenience offers one modal formulation of physicalism, but it is\nworth taking note of a second modal formulation too. Suppose we say\nthat a property G is necessitated by a property F\njust in case, in all possible worlds, if something is F then\nit is G; in this sense, for example, being red necessitates\nbeing colored, and being square necessitates having some extension in\nspace. This suggests a formulation of physicalism along the following\nlines:\n\n(2)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nproperty instantiated at w is necessitated by a physical\nproperty.\n\n\nWhat is the relation between physicalism so defined, which we might\ncall necessity physicalism, and supervenience\nphysicalism? At least if necessitation is understood as a sort of\nentailment, then these are not equivalent; for discussion of this\npoint, see\n supervenience.\n However, (1) and (2) are clearly similar, in particular they are\nmodal formulations of physicalism. In what follows we will concentrate\non supervenience physicalism, but what we will say will apply also to\nnecessity physicalism.\n\nSupervenience physicalism was for many years the dominant version of\nphysicalism; perhaps because of this, many different problems have\nbeen raised for it; some of these problems are discussed in the\nsupplement on:\n\nSupervenience Physicalism: Further Issues\n\n\nBut the most influential objection to supervenience physicalism (and\nto modal formulations generally) is what might be called the\nsufficiency problem. This alleges that, while (1) articulates a\nnecessary condition for physicalism it does not provide a sufficient\ncondition. The underlying rationale is that, intuitively one thing can\nsupervene on another and yet be of a completely different nature. To\nuse Fine\u2019s famous (1994) example, consider the difference between\nSocrates and his singleton set, the set that contains only Socrates as\na member. The facts about the set supervene on the facts about\nSocrates; any world that is like ours in respect of the existence of\nSocrates is like ours in respect of the existence of his singleton\nset. And yet the set is quite different from Socrates. This in turn\nraises the possibility that something might be of a completely\ndifferent nature from the physical and nevertheless supervene on\nit.\n\nOne may bring out this objection further by considering positions in\nphilosophy which entail supervenience and yet deny physicalism. A good\nexample is necessitation dualism, which is an approach that\nweaves together elements of both physicalism and its traditional\nrival, dualism. On the one hand, the necessitation dualist wants to\nsay that mental facts and physical facts are metaphysically\ndistinct\u2014just as a standard dualist does. On the other hand, the\nnecessitation dualist wants to agree with the physicalist that mental\nfacts are necessitated by, and supervene on, the physical facts. If\nthis sort of position is coherent, (1) does not articulate a\nsufficient condition for physicalism. For if necessitation dualism is\ntrue, any physical duplicate of the actual world is a duplicate\nsimpliciter. And yet, if dualism of any sort is true,\nincluding necessitation dualism, physicalism is false.\n\nHow to respond to the sufficiency problem? Some respond by denying the\ncoherence of the position that causes the problem. Necessitation\ndualism as we have just described it violates (what is known as)\nHume\u2019s dictum that there are no necessary connections between\ndistinct existences. According to necessitation dualism, mental and\nphysical properties are metaphysically distinct, and yet are\nnecessarily connected. However, Hume\u2019s dictum is itself a matter\nof controversy (see Jackson 1993, Stalnaker 1996, Stoljar 2010, and\nWilson 2005, 2010). Another approach appeals to a priori physicalism\nwhich will examine below (see Jackson 2006). But by far the most\ncommon response has been to concede that the sufficiency problem shows\nthat supervenience formulation of physicalism is too weak (e.g. Kim\n1998), and to look for an alternative. \n2.2 Identity Physicalism\n\nSuppose then that (1) provides a necessary condition for physicalism\nbut not a sufficient condition; how might we strengthen it to make it\nmore plausible? The most obvious thing to do is to appeal to identity.\nIndeed, in the history of attempts to answer the completeness\nquestion, the appeal to identity predates the appeal to supervenience.\nNevertheless, this version of physicalism\u2014 identity\nphysicalism  as we may call it\u2014runs into serious\nproblems. 2.2.1. Token Physicalism\n\nIn fact there are two different versions of identity physicalism,\ntype physicalism and token physicalism. Token\nphysicalism is the view that every particular thing in the world is a\nphysical particular. So the token physicalist says that physicalism\nshould be formulated in the following way:\n\n(3)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff for every\nparticular (object, event or process) x that exists at\nw, there is some physical particular y such that\nx = y\n\n\nBut (3) offers neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for\nphysicalism. To see that it is not sufficient, consider the variety of\ndualism usually called property dualism. Property dualism\nsays that (a) every particular is a physical particular but (b) some\nparticulars (e.g. human beings) have psychological properties wholly\ndistinct from any physical properties. The contrast here is with\nsubstance dualism. The substance dualist agrees with the\nproperty dualist that some particulars have psychological properties\nwholly distinct from any physical properties, but they will add that\nsuch particulars are themselves non-physical. \n\nToken physicalism \u2013 physicalism according to (3) \u2013 is certainly\ninconsistent with substance dualism. Substance dualism entails that\nsome particulars are non-physical, token physicalism denies it. But\ntoken physicalism is compatible with property dualism; indeed property\ndualism entails that token physicalism is true. On the other hand,\nproperty dualism is usually understood as being inconsistent with\nphysicalism in any form. Hence token physicalism is not sufficient for\nphysicalism. \n\nThe problem that property dualism presents for token physicalism is\nnoteworthy in several respects. For one thing, it is similar to the\nproblem necessitarian dualism presents for supervenience physicalism,\nthough necessitarian dualism can itself be developed either as a sort\nof property dualism or as a sort of substance dualism. For another\nthing, it brings out the important role properties rather than\nparticulars play in the contemporary discussion of physicalism. If one\nignores properties, the dispute between physicalism and dualism may\neasily be understood as the dispute between token physicalism and\nsubstance dualism; but once properties are factored in, things look\nvery different.\n\nNot only does (3) not provide a sufficient condition for physicalism,\nit does not provide a necessary condition either. Consider a social or\nlegal object such as the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit. According to (3), if physicalism is true, there must\nbe some physical object or particular for the court to be identical\nwith. But intuitively, there is no such physical object. Nevertheless,\nphysicalism might still be true. If so, token physicalism is not\nnecessary for physicalism. (Notice here that there is no parallel\nproblem for supervenience physicalism. It entails that the facts about\ncourt supervene on physical facts but not that there is any physical\nobject that the court is identical with. For the classic presentation\nof this point, see Haugeland 1983). 2.2.2. Type\nPhysicalism\n\nTurning now to type physicalism, this holds that every property (or at\nleast every property instantiated in the actual world) is identical\nwith some physical property. So the type physicalist supposes that\nphysicalism should be formulated in the following way:\n\n(4)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nproperty instantiated at w is identical to a physical\nproperty.\n\n\nUnlike both token physicalism and supervenience physicalism, type\nphysicalism is sufficient for physicalism: if every property\ninstantiated in the actual world is identical with some physical\nproperty, then dualism will be false in any of the versions we have\nconsidered\n\nHowever, while (4) provides a sufficient condition for physicalism, it\ndoes not provide a necessary condition. Consider again the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. If type physicalism\nis true, then every property that the court has (for example, having a\nlegal power over lower courts) must be identical with some physical\nproperty. But on the face of it, that is unlikely. Nevertheless,\nphysicalism might still be true. If so, type physicalism is not\nnecessary for physicalism. (Notice again that there is no parallel\nproblem for supervenience physicalism. It entails that the property\nhaving a legal power over lower courts supervenes on physical\nproperties, not that it is identical with a physical property.)\n\nAnother way to bring out the sense in which type physicalism is too\nstrong for physicalism is to focus on the possibility of multiple\nrealizability, as philosophers call it. This is roughly the idea\nthat physically very different creatures can nevertheless share\npsychological properties; see\n multiple realizability.\n A major benefit of supervenience physicalism is that, as usually\nunderstood, it is consistent with this possibility. But type\nphysicalism is often thought of as not consistent with it, at least if\nwe focus on instantiated psychological properties. If so, type\nphysicalism may be false while supervenience physicalism may be\ntrue.\n\nWe have been assuming that supervenience physicalism is distinct from\ntype physicalism. But it is worth noting that, there are ways to\nunderstand supervenience according to which this difference is less\nobvious. The reason for this has to do with questions concerning the\nlogical (or Boolean) closure of the set of physical properties \u2014\nif P, Q and R are physical properties,\nwhich of the various logical permutations of P, Q\nand R are likewise physical properties? On some assumptions\nconcerning closure and supervenience, supervenience physicalism\n(construed as a necessary truth) entails type physicalism; on other\nassumptions, it doesn\u2019t. But the problem is that the assumptions\nthemselves are difficult to interpret and evaluate, and so the issue\nremains a difficult one. It is not necessary for our purposes to\nsettle the question concerning closure here. (For further discussion\nof these issues see Kim 1993, Bacon 1990, Van Cleve 1990, Stalnaker\n1996.)\n2.3 Realization Physicalism\n\nOur discussion of the completeness question has so far yielded\nnegative results: supervenience physicalism is too weak, type\nphysicalism is too strong, and token physicalism is both too weak and\ntoo strong. What seems to be required is an approach that, like the\nmodal formulations we started with, entails the supervenience of\neverything on the physical, but unlike them avoids the sufficiency\nproblem. One prominent idea along these lines appeals to a relation\nbetween properties distinct from both identity and supervenience,\nusually called realization. As in the case of identity\nphysicalism, there are two different versions of realization\nphysicalism as we may call it; we will consider them in turn.\n\n2.3.1 Second-order Physicalism\n\nThe first realization definition has been explored and defended in\nmost detail by Andrew Melnyk (see Melnyk 2003 and the references\ntherein). For Melnyk, a property F realizes a property\nG if and only if (a) G is identical to a\nsecond-order property, the property of having some property that has a\ncertain causal or theoretical role; and (b) F is the property\nthat plays the causal or theoretical role in question. We may call\nthis notion \u2018second-order realization\u2019 to distinguish it\nfrom a different notion of realization to be considered in a moment.\nThis suggests: \n\n(5)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nproperty instantiated at w is either a physical property or\nis second-order realized in a physical property.\n\n\nSuppose we call physicalism so defined second-order realization\nphysicalism or second-order physicalism for short; what\nis the relation between it and supervenience physicalism?\nSupervenience physicalism does not entail second-order physicalism\nsince the fact that a property F supervenes on a property\nG does not entail that F is a second-order property.\n\n\nDoes second-order physicalism entail supervenience physicalism? The\nusual assumption is that it does, but, as Melnyk himself notes at one\npoint (2003, p. 23), there is an issue here having to do with the\ndefinition of a second-order property, the property of having some\nproperty that has a certain causal or theoretical role. What are the\nproperties involved in spelling out these causal or theoretical roles?\nIf physicalism is true at all, it must be true of these properties as\nmuch as any other properties. But then by second-order physicalism,\nthese properties themselves will be either physical or realized by\nphysical properties. If the first option is taken, the second-order\nphysicalist will stand revealed as holding a version of identity\nphysicalism (one level up, as it were), and thus will face the\nmultiple realization objection. If the second option is taken, the\nsecond-order physicalist looks committed to an infinite regress, since\nnow we have further properties realized by physical properties and,\ncorrelatively, further causal or theoretical roles. To avoid the\nregress, the second-order physicalist might say that these properties\nsupervene on or are identical to physical properties. But now it hard\nto see the difference between the realization physicalist and these\nother doctrines. (For some further discussion of this issue, see\nElpidorou 2018a.) 2.3.2 Subset Physicalism\n\nThe second realization definition of physicalism has been developed by\nWilson 1999, 2011 and Shoemaker 2007. On this view, a property\nF realizes a property G if and only if (a)\nG has some set of causal powers or features S; (b)\nF has some set of causal powers or features S*; and\n(c) S is a subset of S*. (We may call this notion\n\u2018subset realization\u2019 to distinguish it from the different\nnotion of realization just considered.) This suggests: \n\n(6)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nproperty instantiated at w is either a physical property or\nis subset realized in a physical property.\n\n\nSuppose we call physicalism so defined subset realization\nphysicalism or subset physicalism for short; what is\nthe relation between it and supervenience physicalism? Supervenience\nphysicalism does not entail subset physicalism since the fact that a\nproperty G supervenes on a property F does not\nentail anything about their causal powers. For example, if causation\nis a macro-phenomenon as some philosophers have held it to be, it may\nbe that F has no causal powers at all, while G does.\n\n\nDoes subset realization physicalism entail supervenience physicalism?\nWell, there is a problem here too having to do with (what is sometimes\ncalled) a causal theory of properties, that is, a theory\naccording to which the causal powers or features that a property\nbestows on the things that have it are exhaustive of the nature of\nthat property. Suppose that a causal theory is false. Then, in\nprinciple, one property might subset realize another and yet be quite\ndifferent from it in nature. And this in turn suggests that subset\nphysicalism does not by itself entail supervenience physicalism. Of\ncourse, one might respond by asserting that the causal theory is true.\nBut to do that is controversial; indeed, even those philosophers who\nhold both a subset model and a causal theory want to\nseparate out these two commitments (e.g. Shoemaker 2007; see also\nWilson 2011). Alternatively, one might respond by denying that\nphysicalism entails supervenience in the first place, by saying that\n\u201clack of \u2026 supervenience is compatible with physicalism\u201d\n(Wilson 2014, 255, see also Wilson 2011). But this too is\ncontroversial; as we saw above, most philosophers assume that\nsupervenience is necessary for physicalism. Hence the status of the\nsubset approach remains controversial. \n2.4 Grounding Physicalism\n\nAn influential recent approach to the completeness question that is\ndifferent from any we have considered so far focuses on the idea of\ngrounding, something that has been extensively discussed recently in\nthe metaphysics literature (see, e.g., Fine 2001, Schaffer 2009, Rosen\n2010, Wilson 2014, Bennett 2017 and the essays in Correia and\nSchneider 2012). Intuitively, a property F is grounded in a\nproperty G just in case F holds in virtue of\nG, or the instantiation of G explains the\ninstantiation of F. This suggests: \n\n(7)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nproperty instantiated at w is either a physical property or\nis grounded in a physical property.\n\n\nSuppose we call physicalism so defined grounding physicalism;\nwhat is the relation between it and supervenience physicalism?\nSupervenience physicalism does not entail grounding physicalism, since\nthe fact that a property F supervenes on a property\nG does not entail that F is grounded by G.\n\n\nDoes grounding physicalism entail supervenience physicalism? Some\nphilosophers suppose it does (e.g. Rosen 2010) and so for them\ngrounding physicalism would entail supervenience physicalism. But\nothers suppose it does not (e.g. Schaffer 2009) which raises the\nquestion of whether a thesis such as (7) by itself provides an account\nof physicalism, or whether some compromise between it and (1) would\nhave to be reached.\n\nEven if grounding physicalism entails supervenience physicalism, there\nare further issues about it that have been raised. One problem\nconcerns abstract objects, i.e., entities apparently not located in\nspace and time, such as numbers, properties and relations, or\npropositions. However, since this problem seems a general problem for\nall kinds of physicalism, we will discuss it below.\n\nA second problem for grounding physicalism is that the notion of\ngrounding is itself controversial in some quarters. Wilson (2014), for\nexample, points out that grounding per se is similar to supervenience\nin that it leaves open many of the questions philosophers of mind are\ninterested in, viz., whether the mental exists, whether it is reduced\nto the physical, and whether it is causally efficacious. She concludes\nthat grounding \u201ccannot do the work\u201d that its proponents\nwant it to do (2014, 542). One might respond that this depends on what\nwork grounding physicalism is supposed to do; indeed, it may be a\nfeature rather than a bug that grounding leaves these things open. But\nwhatever is the truth about this, there is no doubt that the precise\ncontours of the grounding relation are yet to be made out. Hence, the\nproper assessment of grounding physicalism is at this point a bit\nunclear (for some further discussion, see, e.g., Berker 2018 and\nSchaffer 2016). \n2.5 Fundamentality Physicalism\n\nThe final answer to the completeness question we will consider focuses\non the idea of a fundamental property, which is a notion discussed\nextensively in David Lewis\u2019s metaphysics, and the literature\nthat follows on from it. On Lewis\u2019s view, a fundamental or\nperfectly natural property is a special kind of property, one that is,\nas he says, \u201cnot at all disjunctive, or determinable, or\nnegative. They render their instances perfectly similar in some\nrespect. They are intrinsic; and all other intrinsic properties\nsupervene on them\u201d (2009, 204). This suggests the following\nformulation of physicalism:\n\n(8)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nfundamental property instantiated at w is a physical\nproperty.\n\n\nSuppose we call physicalism so defined fundamentality\nphysicalism; what is the relation between it and supervenience\nphysicalism? Supervenience physicalism does not entail fundamentality\nphysicalism, since the fact that a property F supervenes on a\nproperty G does not entail that either property is\nfundamental. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to think that\nfundamentality physicalism entails supervenience physicalism,\nespecially in the light of Lewis\u2019s comment about supervenience\njust quoted.\n\nHow plausible is (8) as an account of physicalism? One objection\nconcerns the notion of a fundamental property quite generally. For at\nleast some philosophers, Lewis\u2019s ideas about fundamentality are, as he\nhimself puts it, a throwback to medieval metaphysics (Lewis 1983).\nAnother objection is that physicalism on this view seems empirically\nspeculative, since it seems to entail that there is a fundamental\nlevel in the world; if so, definitions in terms of grounding may do\nbetter (Schaffer 2003). Whatever is the truth about these objections,\nit is an interesting historical fact that Lewis defines physicalism\ntwice-over. He defines it as supervenience physicalism (as we saw\nabove) and also as fundamentality physicalism. There is no suggestion\nin his work that these are in any sense in tension (for further\ndiscussion, see Stoljar 2015). This underscores the point made\nearlier, namely, that in practice all versions of physicalism, and\nhence any answer to the completeness question, will include modal and\nnon-modal elements. \n3. Varieties of Physicalism\n\nWe have been considering various answers to the completeness question,\nnamely, what it means to say that everything is physical. At this\npoint, it is worth considering two issues associated with completeness\nthat have not so far been brought to the surface, and which suggest\ndifferent varieties of physicalism. The first is whether physicalism\ninvolves a kind of reductionism; the second is whether physicalism\ninvolves what philosophers call a priori entailment or deducibility.\n\n3.1 Reductive and Non-reductive Physicalism\n\nThe main problem in assessing whether a physicalist must be a\nreductionist is that there are various non-equivalent versions of\nreductionism.\n\nOne idea is tied to the notion of conceptual or reductive analysis.\nWhen philosophers attempt to provide an analysis of some concept or\nnotion, they often try to provide a reductive analysis of the notion\nin question, i.e. to analyze it in other terms. Applied to the\nphilosophy of mind, this notion might be thought of entailing the idea\nthat every mental concept or predicate is analyzed in terms of a\nphysical concept or predicate. A formulation of this idea is (9):\n\n(9)\n Reductionism is true iff for each mental predicate F,\nthere is a physical predicate G such that a sentence of the\nform \u2018 x is F iff x is\nG\u2019 is analytically true.\n\n\nWhile one occasionally finds in the literature the suggestion that\nphysicalists are committed to (9) in fact, no physicalist since before\nSmart (1959) has (unqualifiedly) held anything like it. Adapting Ryle\n(1949), Smart supposed that in addition to physical expressions there\nis a class of expressions which are topic-neutral, i.e. expressions\nwhich were neither mental nor physical but when conjoined with any\ntheory would greatly increase the expressive power of the theory.\nSmart suggested that one might analyze mental expressions in\ntopic-neutral (but not physical) terms, which in effect means that a\nphysicalist could reject (9).\n\nA different notion of reduction derives from the attempts of\nphilosophers of science to explain intertheoretic reduction. The\nclassic formulation of this notion was given by Ernest Nagel (1961).\nNagel said that one theory was reduced to another if you could\nlogically derive the first from the second together with what he\ncalled bridge laws, i.e., laws connecting the predicates of the\nreduced theory (the theory to be reduced) with the predicates of the\nreducing theory (the theory to which one is reducing). Here is a\nformulation of this idea, where the theories in question are\npsychology and neuroscience:\n\n(10)\n Reductionism is true iff for each mental predicate F\nthere is a neurobiological predicate G such that a sentence\nof the form \u2018x is F iff x is\nG\u2019 expresses a bridge law.\n\n\nOnce again, however, there is no reason at all why physicalists need\nto accept that reductionism is true in the sense of (10). We noted\nearlier that the possibility of multiple realization renders type\nphysicalism implausible; something similar is true in this case. Many\ndifferent neurobiological processes (whether in our own species or a\ndifferent one) could underlie the same psychological process \u2014\nindeed, given science fiction, even non-neurobiological processes\nmight underlie the same psychological process. If so, (10) seems to be\nfalse. (For a classic presentation of multiple realization and\nreductionism, see Fodor 1974, but for an alternative view, see Kim\n1993).\n\nA third notion of reductionism is more metaphysical in focus than\neither the conceptual or theoretical ideas reviewed so far. According\nto this notion, reductionism means that the properties expressed by\nthe predicates of (say) a psychological theory are identical to the\nproperties expressed by the predicates of (say) a neurobiological\ntheory \u2014 in other words, this version of reductionism is in\nessence a version of type physicalism or the identity theory. As we\nhave already seen, however, since a physicalism need not be a type\nphysicalism, it need not be reductionism in this metaphysical sense\neither\n\nA final notion of reductionism that needs to be distinguished from the\nprevious three concerns whether mental statements follow a\npriori from non-mental statements. Here is a statement of this\nsort of idea,\n\n(11)\n Reductionism is true iff for each mental predicate F\nthere is non-mental predicate G such that a sentence of the\nform \u201cif x is F then x is\nG\u201d is a priori.\n\n\nWhat (11) says is that if reductionism is true, a priori\nknowledge alone, plus knowledge of the physical or non-mental truths\nwill allow one to know the mental truths. This question is usually\ndebated in the context of another, viz., the question of a\nposteriori and a priori physicalism. So we now turn to\nthat question.\n3.2 A Priori and A Posteriori Physicalism\n\nWe have been assuming that supervenience is necessary for physicalism,\neven if it is not sufficient. But what follows from supervenience? One\nthing that is usually thought to follow is that the physical truths of\nthe world entail all the truths; hence physicalism is true at\nall (12) is true\n\n(12)\n The physical truths entail all the truths.\n\n\nNow suppose that S is a statement which specifies the\nphysical nature of the actual world and S* is a statement\nwhich specifies the total nature of the world. (It might be that\nneither S nor S* are expressible in languages we can\nunderstand, but let us set this aside.) Then physicalism tells us in\naddition that that: \n\n(13)\n S entails S*\n\n\nAnother way to say this is to say that if supervenience physicalism is\ntrue, the following conditional is necessarily true: \n\n(14)\n If S then S*\n\n\nIndeed, this is a general feature of supervenience physicalism: if it\nis true then there will always be a necessary truth of the form of\n(14). \n\nNow, if (14) is necessary the question arises whether it is a\npriori, i.e. knowable independent of empirical experience, or\nwhether it is a posteriori, i.e. knowable but not\nindependently of empirical experience. Traditionally, every statement\nthat was necessary was assumed to be a priori. However, since\nKripke\u2019s Naming and Necessity (1980), philosophers have\nbecome used to the idea that there are truths which are both necessary\nand a posteriori. Accordingly many recent philosophers have\ndefended a posteriori physicalism: the claim that statements\nsuch as (14) are necessary and a posteriori (cf. Loar 1997).\nMoreover, they have used this point to try to disarm many objections\nto physicalism, including those concerning qualia and intentionality\nthat we will consider below. Moreover, as we have just noted, some\nphilosophers have suggested that the necessary a posteriori\nprovides the proper interpretation of non-reductive physicalism.\n\nThe appeal to the necessary a posteriori is on the surface an\nattractive one, but it is also controversial. One problem arises from\nthe fact that Kripke\u2019s idea that there are necessary and a\nposteriori truths can be interpreted in two rather different\nways. On the first interpretation \u2014 I will call it the\nderivation view \u2014 while there are necessary a\nposteriori truths, these truths can be derived a priori\nfrom truths which are a posteriori and contingent. On the\nsecond interpretation \u2014 I will call it the non-derivation view\n\u2014 there are non-derived necessary a posteriori\ntruths, i.e. necessary truths which are not derived from any\ncontingent truths (or any a priori truths for that matter).\nThe problem is that when one combines the derivation view with the\nclaim that (14) is necessary and a posteriori, one encounters\na contradiction. If the derivation view is correct, then there is some\ncontingent and a posteriori statement S# that\nlogically entails (14). However, if S# logically entails (14)\nthen (since \u2018If C, then if A then\nB\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018If C &\nA, then B\u2019) we can infer that the following is\nboth necessary and a priori:\n\n(15)\n If S & S# then S*.\n\n\nOne the other hand, if physicalism is true, and S summarizes\nthe total nature of the world then\nS# is already implicitly included in S. In other\nwords, (15) is simply an expansion\nof (14). But if (15) is just an expansion of (14), then if (15) is\na priori, (14) must also be a priori. But that means\nour initial assumption is false: (14) is not a necessary a\nposteriori truth after all (see Jackson 1998). \n\nHow might an a posteriori physicalist respond to this\nobjection? The obvious response is to reject the derivation view of\nthe necessary a posteriori in favor of the non-derivation\nview. But this is just to say that if one wants to defend a\nposteriori physicalism, one will have to defend the\nnon-derivation view of the necessary a posteriori. However,\nthe non-derivation view is controversial, so it is not something that\nwe can hope to solve here. (For discussion, see Byrne 1999, Chalmers\n1996, 1999, Jackson 1998, Loar 1997, Lewis 1994, Yablo 1999, and the\npapers in Gendler and Hawthorne 2004)\n4. The Condition Question\n\nEarlier we distinguished two interpretative questions with respect to\nphysicalism, the completeness question and the condition question. So\nfar we have been concerned with the completeness question. I turn now\nto the condition question, the question of what it is for something\n(an object, an event, a process, a property) to be physical.\n\nThis issue has received less attention in the literature than the\nquestions we have been studying so far. But it is just as important.\nWithout any understanding of what the physical is, we can have no\nserious understanding of what physicalism is. After all, what does it\nmean to say that everything is physical, as opposed to chemical or\nfinancial. (The point here is quite general: if Thales says that\neverything is water, we don\u2019t understand what he says unless he\nsays something about what water is. The physicalist is in the same\nboat.)\n4.1 The Theory and Object Conceptions of the Physical\n\nSo what is the answer to the condition question? If we concentrate for\nsimplicity on the notion of a physical property, we can discern two\nkinds of answers to this question (see Stoljar 2001, Stoljar 2010,\nTiehen 2018). The first ties the notion of a physical property to a\nnotion of a physical theory, for this reason we can call it the\ntheory-based conception of a physical property:\n\nThe theory-based conception:\n\nA property is physical iff it is the sort of property that physical\ntheory tells us about.\n\nAccording to the theory-based conception, for example, if physical\ntheory tells us about the property of having mass, then having mass is\na physical property. (The theory-based conception bears some relation\nto the notion of physical1 discussed in Feigl 1967; more explicit\ndefense is found in Smart 1978, Lewis 1994, Braddon-Mitchell and\nJackson 1996, and Chalmers 1996.)\n\nThe second kind of answer ties the notion of a physical property to\nthe notion of a physical object, for this reason we can call it the\nobject-based conception of a physical property:\n\nThe object-based conception:\n\nA property is physical iff it is the sort of property had by\nparadigmatic physical objects and their constituents.\n\nAccording to the object-based conception, for example if paradigmatic\nphysical objects such as rocks or planets are solid or are located in\nspace or have mass, then the property of being solid or located in\nspace or having mass is a physical property. (The best examples of\nphilosophers who operate with the object-conception of the physical\nare Meehl and Sellars 1956 and Feigl 1967; more recent defense is to\nbe found in Jackson 1998.)\n\nDo these conceptions characterize the same class of properties? There\nare a number of different possibilities here, but one that has\nreceived some attention in the literature is that physical theory only\ntells us about the dispositional properties of physical objects, and\nso does not tell us about the categorical properties, if any, that\nthey have \u2014 a thesis of this sort has been defended by a number\nof philosophers, among them Russell (1927), Armstrong (1968),\nBlackburn (1992) and Chalmers (1996). Hence, if physical objects do\nhave categorical properties, those properties will not count as\nphysical by the standards of the theory conception. On the other hand,\nthere seems no reason not to count them as physical in some sense or\nother. If that is right, however, then the possibility emerges that\nthe theory- and the object-conceptions characterize distinct classes\nof properties. \n\nA further distinction that can be made here, and which cross-cuts the\ntheory/object distinction, is between a more narrow and a more broad\nconception of a physical property (see Chalmers 2015). A narrow\nconception counts as a physical property only those within a\nrestricted range. On the theory conception, for example, these might\nthe properties expressed by fundamental physics. A broader conception\ncounts as physical property any property which is either a property in\nthe narrow sense (a narrow physical property, as we might call it) or\nelse bears the right kind of relation to narrow physical properties,\nfor example, is definable in terms of them, or is grounded in them.\nThere are lots of complications here, partly because there are\ndifferent ways of restricting the narrow class, and different ways of\nextending such a class. Here we will understand the theory and object\nconceptions in a narrower rather than a broad way.\n4.2 Circularity\n\nAlong with the concepts of space, time, causality, value, meaning,\ntruth and existence, the concept of the physical is one of the central\nconcepts of human thought. So it should not be surprising that any\nattempt to come to grips with what a physical property is will be\ncontroversial. The theory and object conceptions are no different:\neach has provoked a number of different questions and criticisms. In\nthe remainder of our discussion of the condition question, I will\nreview some main ones.\n\nTo begin with, one might object that both conceptions are inadequate\nbecause they are circular, i.e., both appeal to the notion of\nsomething physical (a theory or an object) to characterize a physical\nproperty. But how can you legitimately explain the notion of one sort\nof physical thing by appealing to another? \n\nHowever, the response to this is that circularity is only a problem if\nthe conceptions are interpreted as providing a reductive analysis of\nthe notion of the physical. But there is no reason why they should be\ninterpreted in that way. After all, we have many concepts that we\nunderstand without knowing how to analyze (cf. Lewis 1970). So there\nseems no reason to suppose that either the theory or object conception\nis providing anything else but a way of understanding the notion of\nthe physical.\n\nThe point here is an important one in the context of the condition\nquestion. Earlier we said that the condition question was perfectly\nlegitimate because it is legitimate to ask what the condition of being\nphysical is that, according to physicalism, everything has. But this\nlegitimate question should not be interpreted as the demand for a\nreductive analysis of the notion of the physical. Consider Thales\nagain: it is right to ask Thales what he means by \u2018water\u2019\n\u2014 and in so doing demand an understanding of the notion of water\n\u2014 but it is wrong to demand of him a conceptual analysis of\nwater.\n4.3 Hempel\u2019s dilemma\n\nOne might object that any formulation of physicalism which utilizes\nthe theory-based conception will be either trivial or false. Carl\nHempel (cf. Hempel 1969, see also Crane and Mellor 1990) provided a\nclassic formulation of this problem: if physicalism is defined via\nreference to contemporary physics, then it is false \u2014 after all,\nwho thinks that contemporary physics is complete? \u2014 but if\nphysicalism is defined via reference to a future or ideal physics,\nthen it is trivial \u2014 after all, who can predict what a future\nphysics contains? Perhaps, for example, it contains even mental items.\nThe conclusion of the dilemma is that one has no clear concept of a\nphysical property, or at least no concept that is clear enough to do\nthe job that philosophers of mind want the physical to play. \n\nOne response to this objection is to take its first horn, and insist\nthat, at least in certain respects contemporary physics really is\ncomplete or else that it is rational to believe that it is (cf. Smart\n1978, Lewis 1994 and Melnyk 1997, 2003). There is an element of truth\nin this. It may be rational to believe that contemporary science is\ntrue, even if not that it is complete. Nevertheless, it also seems\nmistaken to define physicalism with respect to the physics\nthat happens to be true in this world. The reason is that whether a\nphysical theory is true or not is a function of the contingent facts;\nbut whether a property is physical or not is not a function of the\ncontingent facts. For example, consider medieval impetus physics.\nMedieval impetus physics is false (though of course it might not have\nbeen) and thus it is irrational to suppose it true. Nevertheless, the\nproperty of having impetus \u2014 the central property that objects\nhave according to impetus physics \u2014 is a physical property, and\na counterfactual world completely described by impetus physics would\nbe a world in which physicalism is true. But it is hard to see how any\nof this could be right if physicalism were defined by reference to the\nphysics that we have now or by the physics that happens to be true in\nour world. (For development of this point, and for a dilemma that is\nsimilar to Hempel\u2019s but which casts the issue in modal rather\nthan temporal terms, see Stoljar 2010; for discussion, see Baltimore\n2013, Fiorese 2016)\n\nA different response to Hempel\u2019s dilemma is that what it shows,\nif it shows anything, is that a particular proposal about how to\ndefine a physical property \u2014 namely, via reference to physics at\na particular stage of its development \u2014 is mistaken. But from\nthis one can hardly conclude that we have no clear understanding of\nthe concept at all. As we have seen, we have many concepts that we\ndon\u2019t know how to analyze. So the mere fact \u2014 if indeed it\nis a fact \u2014 that a certain style of analysis of the notion of\nthe physical fails does not mean that there is no notion of the\nphysical at all, still less that we don\u2019t understand the\nnotion.\n\nOne might object that, while these remarks are perfectly true, they\nnevertheless don\u2019t speak to something that is right about\nHempel\u2019s dilemma, namely, that for the theory-conception to be\ncomplete one needs to know what type of theory a physical theory is.\nPerhaps one might appeal here to the fact that we have a number of\nparadigms of what a physical theory is: common sense physical theory,\nmedieval impetus physics, Cartesian contact mechanics, Newtonian\nphysics, and modern quantum physics. While it seems unlikely that\nthere is any one factor that unifies this class of theories,\nperhaps there is a cluster of factors \u2014 a common or overlapping\nset of theoretical constructs, for example, or a shared methodology.\nIf so, one might maintain that the notion of a physical theory is a\nWittgensteinian family resemblance concept. However, whether this is\nenough to answer the question of what kind of theory a physical theory\nis remains to be seen. (For further discussion of Hempel\u2019s\ndilemma, see the papers in Elpidorou 2018a.) \n4.4 The panpsychism problem\n\nHempel\u2019s dilemma against the theory-conception is similar to an\nobjection that one often hears propounded against the\nobject-conception (cf. Jackson 1998). Consider a version of\npanpsychism according to which all the physical objects of our\nacquaintance are conscious beings just as we are. (For further\ndiscussion and different versions of this view, see\n Panpsychism.)\n Would physicalism be true in that situation? It seems intuitively\nnot; however, if physicalism is defined via reference to the\nobject-conception of a physical property then it is hard to see why\nnot. After all, according to that conception, something is a physical\nproperty just in case it is required by a complete account of\nparadigmatic physical objects. But this makes no reference to the\nnature of paradigmatic physical objects, and so allows the\npossibility that physicalism is true in the imagined situation.\n\nOne thing to say in response to this objection is that the mere\npossibility of panpsychism cannot really be what is at issue here. For\npanpsychism per se is not inconsistent with physicalism (cf. Lewis\n1983). After all, the fact that there are some conscious\nbeings is not contrary to physicalism \u2014 why then should the\npossibility that everything is a conscious being be contrary\nto physicalism? If so, what is at issue in the objection is not\npanpsychism so much as the possibility that the paradigms or exemplars\nin terms of which one characterizes the notion of the physical might\nturn out to be radically different from what we normally assume in a\nquite specific sense \u2014 they might turn out to be in some\nessential or ultimate respect mental.\n\nOnce the problem is put like that, however, the panpsychism problem\nlooks similar to a problem that arises in general whenever one one\ntries to understand or define a concept in terms of paradigmatic\nobjects which fall under it, viz., that these definitions have certain\nsort of empirical presuppositions that might turn out to be false.\nSuppose one tried to define the concept red in terms of similarity to\nparadigmatic red things, such as blood. Pursuing this strategy commits\none to the idea that the belief that blood is red is a piece of common\nknowledge shared among all those who are competent with the term. But\nthat seems wrong \u2014 someone who thought that blood was green\nwould be mistaken about blood but not about red. Now this problem is a\ndifficult problem, however \u2014 and this is the crucial point for\nour purposes \u2014 the problem is also a quite general problem; it\narises because of the paradigm style of definition. So to that extent,\nthe concept of the physical does not seem to be any worse off than the\nconcept of red, the panpsychism problem notwithstanding. (For\ndiscussion of the general strategy see Lewis 1997)\n\nOf course, one would reject this entire line of thought if one\nrejected its starting point, viz., that panpsychism is consistent with\nphysicalism. Wilson (2006, 78\u20139), for example, suggests that\nwhile physicalism is consistent with the view that some conscious\nbeings exist, it is not consistent with the view that some fundamental\nconscious beings exist, and it is this last claim that is definitive\nof panpsychism. But in fact even that is consistent with physicalism,\nthough admittedly of an unusual sort. To illustrate, imagine a world\nin which the fundamental properties are both mental and physical. That\nis certainly a far-fetched scenario but it doesn\u2019t seem to be\nimpossible. Would physicalism be true in such a world? It is hard to\nsee why not; at least it may be true at that world that any physical\nduplicate of it is a duplicate simpliciter. Would panpsychism\nlikewise be true at such a world? Again, it is hard to see why not,\nsince the fundamental properties instantiated at such a world are\nmental, though of course they are also physical.\n4.5 The via negativa \n\nOne idea that often emerges in the context of Hempel\u2019s dilemma\nand the panpsychism problem, but deserves separate treatment, is the\nso-called Via Negativa (see e.g. Montero and Papineau 2005, Wilson\n2006, Fiorese 2016). \n\nThe simplest way to introduce the Via Negativa is to interpret it as a\ndefinition of the notion a physical property something like this:\nF is a physical property if and only if F is a\nnon-mental property. But there are many reasons to resist such a\ndefinition. Take vitalism. Vitalism isn\u2019t true, but it might\nhave been true; there is no contradiction in it for example. So\nimagine a world in which plants and animals instantiate the key\nproperty associated with vitalism, viz., \u00e9lan vital. It seems\nreasonable to say that in that case plants and animals instantiate a\nproperty that is non-physical, i.e. \u00e9lan vital is not physical.\nAnd yet one should not say on this account that plants and animals\ninstantiate a mental property, i.e., \u00e9lan vital is not mental.\nIn short, \u00e9lan vital is neither mental nor physical. But the\nVia Negativa as stated cannot accommodate that fact.\n\nOne might try to meet this objection by revising the Via Negativa so\nthat what is intended is only a partial definition along these lines:\nF is a physical property only if F is non-mental. Even\nso problems remain. As we have seen \u00e9lan vital causes a problem\nbecause it is neither mental nor physical. But there might be\nproperties that are both mental and physical. Consider a version of\nthe identity theory according to which being in pain just is c-fibers\nfiring. If we suppose that such a theory is true, is the property of\nbeing in pain then mental or physical? Both presumably; but this could\nnot be true on the Via Negativa construed as a definition of what a\nphysical property is, even a partial definition. For if a property is\nmental and physical, then, given the Via Negativa, it will be both\nmental and non-mental which (of course) it can\u2019t be! Now\nobviously, there are good questions about whether an identity theory\nalong these lines is or could be true, but regardless of whether it is\ntrue, it should not be ruled out simply because of a proposal about\nhow to define the words in which it is stated. \n\nAlternatively, one might try to meet the objection by adopting what\nWilson 2006 calls the \u2018no fundamental mentality\u2019\nconstraint. On this interpretation, what proponents of the Via\nNegativa have in mind is that F is a physical property only if\nF is not fundamentally mental, where in turn to be \u2018not\nfundamentally mental\u2019 is most naturally understood as entailing\nthat if F is a fundamental property then it is non-mental. This\nversion of the view avoids the problem about having c-fibers since\npresumably that property is not fundamental. But once again problems\nremain. Take the world we considered above at which the fundamental\nproperties are both mental and physical; in effect, what applies to\nc-fibers firing (if the identity theory is true) applies to the\nfundamental properties instantiated at this world. As I said, this\nscenario is far-fetched, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be impossible,\nand it is certainly not impossible simply as a matter of the\ndefinition of the words. And yet it would be impossible for that\nreason if the \u2018no fundamental mentality\u2019 version of the\nVia Negativa were true.\n\nOf course, to raise these problems for the Via Negativa is not to deny\nthat there is something right about it. For example, when we think of\nproperties that would falsify physicalism we do often think of\n*certain* mental properties, e.g., the distinctive properties of\nectoplasm or ESP. However, this fact\u2014that certain mental\nproperties would, if instantiated, falsify physicalism\u2014can be\ncaptured without defining the physical in general as the non-mental. A\nbetter way would be to require, of any spelling out of the notion of\nthe physical, whether it be the object-based account or the\ntheory-based account, that it respect that fact that some\n(uninstantiated) mental properties are non-physical.\n4.6 Structuralist Approaches\n\nAnother idea about how to define the physical that has become\nprominent in recent times is a structuralist approach to the\nphysical.\n\nOne way to introduce the structuralist approach is to see it as a\ndevelopment of the theory conception formulated above. On the theory\nview, a property is physical just in case it is tied in the right way\nto a physical theory. One problem that arises for such a view, as we\nhave seen, is what \u2018physical theory\u2019 is supposed to mean\nhere. For the structuralist (at least in the context;\n\u2018structuralism\u2019 can mean many different things), a\nphysical theory is one that employs a restricted vocabulary. One\nparticularly frank version of this sort of view is suggested by\nRussell 1927; on this view, the vocabulary in question is restricted\nto logical or mathematical vocabulary. Contemporary philosophers adopt\na less restricted view according to which the vocabulary is either\nlogical or mathematical or causal or nomological (i.e. pertaining to\nlaws) or some combination of these (see Alter 2016, Chalmers 2020,\nGoff 2017; for criticism see Stoljar 2020). In effect, proposals like\nthis provide a topic-neutral conception of the physical, and hence a\ntopic-neutral conception of physicalism.\n\nAn attractive feature of this approach is that it provides an answer\nto Hempel\u2019s dilemma and similar problems. Physics may indeed\nchange over time, but according to the structuralist, any physical\ntheory must be restricted to this sort of vocabulary. Hence we can\nappeal to the notion of a physical theory to formulate a version of\nphysicalism on which everything supervenes on or is realised by or is\ngrounded in physical properties that can be expressed in that limited\nvocabulary. (Here structuralism about the physical draws support from\nstructural realism in philosophy of science, a position to which it is\nin some ways quite similar; see, e.g.\n Structural Realism)\n\nHowever, a problem for structuralism (developed in Stoljar 2020) is\nthat, while placing restrictions of this sort on the notion of a\nphysical theory helps with Hempel\u2019s dilemma, it also seems\noverly stringent. Physical theories on the face of it tell you lots of\nthings about the physical world which are not topic-neutral, for\nexample, about mass, energy, electrons, protons and a myriad other\nthings. The idea that we can capture all of this using a language that\nemploys only logical/mathematical or causal/nomic vocabulary\nmay seem an overly ambitious one. \n\nWhile there are problems with structuralist approaches to the\nphysical, as with the Via Negativa, there is also something right\nabout it. We have noted one idea in philosophy of science that is\nsimilar to the structuralist approach to the physical, namely,\nstructural realism. A different idea that philosophers of science have\nemphasised a lot in recent literature is that physicists and other\nscientists often construct mathematical models of the systems they are\ninterested in; moreover, they often focus on the mathematical\nproperties of these models themselves (see, e.g. Weisberg 2013).\nPerhaps a structuralist approach to such mathematical models is\nplausible. Nevertheless, structuralism about the physical is a thesis,\nnot about these mathematical models, but about the target systems that\nthese models correspond to, and it precisely this that causes the\nproblem.\n4.7 Physicalism as an Attitude\n\nIn view of the difficulties posed by Hempel\u2019s dilemma and\nrelated problems, some philosophers have explored the interesting idea\nthat to be a physicalist is not to hold some thesis or belief \u2013\nthat is, to hold something that may be true or false \u2013 but is\nrather to adopt a kind of attitude or stance. As Alyssa Ney (2008, p.\n9, see also Van Fraassen 2002) develops this \u201cattitudinal\u201d\nview, for example, \u201cphysicalism is an attitude one takes to form\none\u2019s ontology completely and solely according to what physics\nsays exists\u201d. \n\nNow, as with other ideas we have looked at, there is certainly\nsomething right about the attitudinal view. As we will see below,\ncontemporary physicalists are often methodological naturalists, and\nmethodological naturalists may well hold the attitude Ney describes.\nNevertheless, there is a major problem for the view, viz., that on the\nface of it holding this sort of attitude is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for being a physicalist. \n\nTo see it is not necessary, consider such ancient philosophers as\nDemocritus or Lucretius. These philosophers are physicalists, or at\nleast are usually classified that way, i.e., since they held the\ndoctrine traditionally called \u2018materialism\u2019. But they did\nnot hold the attitude Ney describes, either implicitly or explicitly,\nfor physics (at least identified sociologically) did not exist in\ntheir day at all.\n\nIn response, one might adjust the attitudinal view so that the\n\u2018physics\u2019 towards which one holds the relevant attitude is\nnot identified sociologically, but is instead understood as a certain\nsort of theory considered in the abstract. But then further problems\narise. First, it is now difficult to see the difference between\nholding the relevant attitude and simply believing a thesis. If one\nresolves to be guided in one\u2019s ontology by the truth of a\nparticular theory, how is that different from just believing the\ntheory? Second, if one holds an attitude toward a particular theory,\nHempel\u2019s dilemma seems to arise again though in a slightly\ndifferent form. For which physical theory is meant? If one means\ncurrent physics, as in fact Ney suggests, then one might argue that\nthis is not an attitude that physicalists should reasonably hold,\nsince current physics is incomplete; and if one means ideal physics,\nit is hard to see what the content or nature of the attitude is.\n\nTo see that the attitude is not sufficient, imagine a situation in\nwhich physics postulates properties or objects which are like those\npostulated by traditional dualists; as Ney puts it imagine \u201cit\nis the year 3000 AD and physicists have been forced to introduce\nirreducible mental entities into their theory.\u201d (2008, p. 12).\nIn such a situation, a person might hold the attitude Ney describes,\nand yet intuitively not be a physicalist. \n\nIn response, Ney agrees that this is a possibility but points out,\nfirst, it would still be reasonable to criticize the people who hold\nthe attitude \u2013 for example, on the grounds that those who hold a\ndifferent attitude might have arrived at correct ontology more quickly\n\u2013 and, second, that it doesn\u2019t follow that the attitude\ndefinitive of physicalism is identical to the attitude definitive of\ndualism. (The ideas underlying this second point are (a) if one adopts\nthe attitudinal view about physicalism then one should in fairness\nadopt it about dualism as well; and (b) that from the fact that two\nattitudes coincide in a possible situation it does not follow that\nthey are identical.) However, while both these suggestions might be\ntrue, it is hard to see them as responding to the basic point that\nperson who holds the attitude Ney describes in the imagined situation\nis not correctly described as a physicalist. In principle, after all,\nsuch a person may be criticized in many ways; moreover, the fact that\nholding a particular attitude is not sufficient for being a\nphysicalist does not entail that doing so is necessary for being a\ndualist.\n5. The Case Against Physicalism\n\nHaving provided an answer to the interpretation question, I now turn\nto the truth question: is physicalism (as we have interpreted it so\nfar) true? I will first discuss three reasons for supposing that\nphysicalism is not true. Then I will consider the case for\nphysicalism.\n5.1 Qualia and Consciousness\n\nThe main argument against physicalism is usually thought to concern\nthe notion of qualia, the felt qualities of experience. The notion of\nqualia raises puzzles of its own, puzzles having to do with its\nconnection to other notions such as consciousness, introspection,\nepistemic access, acquaintance, the first-person perspective and so\non. However the idea that we will discuss here is the apparent\ncontradiction between the existence of qualia and physicalism.\n\nPerhaps the clearest version of this argument is Jackson\u2019s\nknowledge argument; see\n qualia: the knowledge argument.\n This argument asks us to imagine Mary, a famous neuroscientist\nconfined to a black and white room. Mary is forced to learn about the\nworld via black and white television and computers. However, despite\nthese hardships Mary learns (and therefore knows) all that physical\ntheory can teach her. Now, if physicalism were true, it is plausible\nto suppose that Mary knows everything about the world. And yet \u2014\nand here is Jackson\u2019s point \u2014 it seems she does not know\neverything. For, upon being released into the world of color, it will\nbecome obvious that, inside her room, she did not know what it is like\nfor both herself and others to see colors \u2014 that is, she did not\nknow about the qualia instantiated by particular experiences of seeing\ncolors. Following Jackson (1986), we may summarize the argument as\nfollows:\n\n\nP1. Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to\nknow about other people. \n\nP2. Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to\nknow about other people (because she learns something about them on\nbeing released).\n\nConclusion. There are truths about other people (and herself) that\nescape the physicalist story.\n\n\nClearly this conclusion entails that physicalism is false: for if\nthere are truths which escape the physicalist story how can everything\nsupervene on the physical? So a physicalist must either reject a\npremise or show that the premises don\u2019t entail the\nconclusion.\n\nThere are many possible responses to this argument, but here I will\nbriefly mention only three. The first is the ability\nhypothesis due to Lawrence Nemerow (1988) and developed and\ndefended by David Lewis (1994). The ability hypothesis follows Ryle\n(1949) in drawing a sharp distinction between propositional knowledge\nor knowledge-that (such as \u2018Mary knows that snow is\nwhite\u2019) and knowledge-how (such as \u2018Mary knows how to ride\na bike\u2019), and then suggests that all Mary gains is the latter.\nOn the other hand, P2 would only be true if Mary gained propositional\nknowledge.\n\nA second response appeals to the distinction between a priori\nand a posteriori physicalism. As we saw above, the crucial\nclaim of a posteriori physicalism is that (13) \u2014 i.e.\nthe claim that S entails S* \u2014 is a\nposteriori. Since (13) is a posteriori, you would need\ncertain experience to know it. But, it is argued, Mary has not had\n(and cannot have) the relevant experience. Hence she does not know\n(13). On the other hand, the mere fact that Mary has not had (and\ncannot have) the experience to know (13) does not remove the\npossibility that (13) is true. Hence a posteriori physicalism\ncan avoid the knowledge argument. (It is an interesting question which\npremise of the knowledge argument is being attacked by this response.\nThe answer depends on whether (13) is physical or not: if (13) is\nphysical, then the response attacks P1. But if (13) is not physical,\nthe response is that the argument is invalid.).\n\nA third response is to distinguish between various conceptions of the\nphysical. We saw above that potentially the class of properties\ndefined by the theory-conception of the physical was distinct from the\nclass of properties defined by the object-conception. But that\nsuggests that the first premise of the argument is open to\ninterpretation in either of two ways. On the other hand,\nJackson\u2019s thought experiment only seems to support the premise\nif it is interpreted in the one way, since Mary learns by learning all\nthat physical theory can teach her. But leaves open the\npossibility that one might appeal to the object-conception of the\nphysical to define a version of physicalism which evades the knowledge\nargument.\n\nOne of the most lively areas of philosophy of mind concerns the issue\nof which if any of these responses to the knowledge argument will be\nsuccessful. (See the papers in Ludlow, Nagasawa, and Stoljar 2004. See\nalso\n Qualia: The Knowledge Argument)\n The ability response raises questions about whether know-how is\ngenuinely non-propositional (cf. Lycan 1996, Loar 1997 and Stanley and\nWilliamson 2001), and about whether it gets the facts right to begin\nwith (Braddon Mitchell and Jackson 1996). As against a\nposteriori physicalism, it has been argued both that it rests on\na mistaken approach to the necessary a posteriori (Chalmers\n1996, 1999, Jackson 1998), and that the promise of the idea is\nchimerical anyway (cf. Stoljar 2000). The third response raises\nquestions about the distinction between the object and the theory\nconception of the physical and associated issues about dispositional\nand categorical properties, and also about the relation between\nphysicalism on the one hand, and a related view, sometimes called\nRussellian monism. See\n Russellian monism,\n as well as Chalmers 1996, Lockwood 1992, Stoljar 2000, 2001, Montero\n2010, 2015) \n5.2 Meaning and Intentionality\n\nPhilosophers of mind often divide the problems of physicalism into\ntwo: first, there are the problems of qualia, typified by the\nknowledge argument; second, there are problems of intentionality. The\nintentionality of mental states is their aboutness, their capacity to\nrepresent the world as being a certain way. One does not simply think,\none thinks of (or about) Vienna; similarly, one does\nnot simply believe, one believes that snow is white. Just as\nin the case of qualia, some of the puzzles of intentionality derive\nfrom facts internal to the notion, and from the relation of this\nnotion to the others such as rationality, inference and language; see\n Intentionality.\n But others derive from the fact that it seems difficult to square the\nfact that mental states have intentionality with physicalism. There\nare a number of ways of developing this criticism but much recent work\nhas concentrated on a certain line of argument that Saul Kripke has\nfound in the work of Wittgenstein (1982; see also\n Private Language).\n\nKripke\u2019s argument is best approached by first considering what\nis often called a dispositional theory of linguistic meaning.\nAccording to the dispositional theory, a word means what it does\n\u2014 for example, the word \u2018red\u2019 means red \u2014\nbecause speakers of the word are disposed to apply to word to red\nthings. Now, for a number of reasons, this sort of theory has been\nvery popular among physicalists. First, the concept of a disposition\nat issue here is clearly a concept that is compatible with\nphysicalism. After all, the mere fact that vases are fragile and sugar\ncubes are soluble (both are classic examples of dispositional\nproperties) does not cause a problem for physicalism, so why should\nthe idea that human beings have similar dispositional properties?\nSecond, it seems possible to develop the dispositional theory of\nlinguistic meaning so that it might apply also to intentionality.\nAccording to a dispositional theory of intentionality, a mental\nconcept would mean what it does because thinkers are disposed to\nemploy the concept in thought in a certain way. So a dispositional\ntheory seems to hold out the best promise of a theory of\nintentionality that is compatible with physicalism.\n\nKripke\u2019s argument is designed to destroy that promise. (In fact,\nKripke\u2019s argument is designed to destroy considerably more than\nthis: the conclusion of his argument is a paradoxical one to the\neffect that there can be no such a thing as a word\u2019s having a\nmeaning. However, we will concentrate on the aspects of the argument\nthat bear on physicalism.) In essence his argument is this. Imagine a\nsituation in which (a) the dispositional theory is true; (b) the word\n\u2018red\u2019 means red for a speaker S; and yet (c) the speaker\nmisapplies the word \u2014 for example, S is looking at a white thing\nthrough rose-tinted spectacles and calls it red. Now, in that\nsituation, it would seem that S is disposed to apply \u2018red\u2019\nto things which are (not merely red but)\neither-red-or-white-but-seen-through-rose-tinted-spectacles. But then,\nby the theory, the word \u2018red\u2019 means (not red but)\neither-red-or-white-as-seen-through-rose-tinted-spectacles. But that\ncontradicts our initial claim (b), that \u2018red\u2019 means red.\nIn other words, the dispositional theory, when combined with a true\nclaim about the meaning of word, plus a truism about meaning \u2014\nthat people can misapply meaningful words \u2014 leads to a\ncontradiction and is therefore false.\n\nHow might a physicalist respond to Kripke\u2019s argument? As with\nthe knowledge argument, there are many responses but here I will\nmention only two. The first response is to insist that Kripke\u2019s\nargument neglects the distinction between a priori and a\nposteriori physicalism. Kripke often does say that according to\nthe dispositionalist, one should be able to \u2018read off\u2019\ntruths about meaning from truths a physicalist can accept. (For a\nproposal like this, see Horwich 2000.) One problem with this proposal\nis, as we have seen, that its background account of the necessary\na posteriori is controversial. As we saw, a\nposteriori physicalists are committed to what we called the\nnon-derivation view about necessary a posteriori truths. But\nthe non-derivation view has come under attack in recent times.\n\nThe second response is to defend the dispositional theory against\nKripke\u2019s argument. One way to do this is to argue that the\nargument only works against a very simple dispositionalism, and that a\nmore complicated version of such a theory would avoid these problems.\n(For a proposal along these lines, see Fodor 1992 and the discussion\nin Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson 1996). A different proposal is to\nargue that Kripke\u2019s argument underestimates the complexity in\nthe notion of a disposition. The mere fact that in certain\ncircumstances someone would apply \u2018red\u2019 to white things\ndoes not mean that they are disposed to apply red to white things\n\u2014 after all, the mere fact that in certain circumstances\nsomething would burn does not mean that it is flammable in the\nordinary sense. (For a proposal along these lines see Hohwy 1998, and\nHeil and Martin 1998)\n\nAs with the knowledge argument, the issues surrounding Kripke\u2019s\nargument are very much wide open. But it is important to note that\nmost philosophers don\u2019t consider the issues of intentionality as\nseriously as the issue of qualia when it comes to physicalism. In\ndifferent vocabularies, for example, both Block (1995) and Chalmers\n(1996) distinguish between the intentional aspects of the mind or\nconsciousness, and the phenomenal aspects or qualia, and suggest that\nit is really the latter that is the central issue. As Chalmers notes\n(1996; p. 24), echoing Chomsky\u2019s famous distinction, the\nintentionality issue is a problem, but the qualia issue is a\nmystery.\n5.3 Numbers and Abstracta\n\nA third problem, which we mentioned briefly above, is the problem\nof abstracta (Rabin 2020). This concerns the status within\nphysicalism of abstract objects, i.e., entities apparently not located\nin space and time, such as numbers, properties and relations, or\npropositions.\n\nTo see the problem, suppose that abstract objects, if they exist,\nexist necessarily, i.e., in all possible worlds. If physicalism is\ntrue, then the facts about such objects must either be physical facts,\nor else bear a particular relation (grounding, realisation) to the\nphysical. But on the face of it, that is not so. Can one really say\nthat 5+7=12, for example, is realised in, or holds in virtue of, some\narrangement of atoms and void? Or can one say that it itself is a\nphysical fact or a fundamental physical fact? If not, physicalism is\nfalse: the property of being such that 5+7=12 obtains the actual world\nbut is neither identical to, nor grounded in or realized by, any\nphysical property. (Sometimes the problem of abstracta is formulated\nas concerning, not abstract objects such as numbers or properties, but\nthe grounding or realization facts themselves; see, e.g, Dasgupta\n2015. We will set this aside here.)\n\nThere are a number of responses to this problem in the literature; for\nan overview, see Rabin 2020, see also Dasgupta 2015 and Bennett 2017;\nfor more general discussion of physicalism and abstracta, see Montero\n2017, Schneider 2017, and Witmer 2017.\n\nOne response points out that, while the problem of abstracta confronts\nmany different versions of physicalism, it does not arise for\nsupervenience physicalism. After all, since numbers exist in all\npossible worlds, facts about them trivially supervene on the physical;\nany world identical to the actual world in physical respects will be\nidentical to it in respect of whether 5+7=12, because any world at all\nis identical to the actual world in that respect! But the difficulty\nhere is that supervenience physicalism seems, as we saw above, too\nweak anyway. Indeed, one might think that the example of abstracta is\nsimply a different way to bring out that it is too weak.\n\nAnother option is to adopt a version of nominalism, and deny the\nexistence of abstracta entirely. The problem with this option is that\ndefending nominalism about mathematics is no easy matter, and in any\ncase nominalism and physicalism are normally thought of as distinct\ncommitments.\n\nA third view, which seems more attractive than either of the two\nmentioned so far, is to expand the notion of a physical property that\nis in play in formulations of physicalism. For example, one might\ntreat the properties of abstract objects as topic-neutral in\nsomething like the sense discussed in connection with Smart and\nreductionism above (see section 3.1). Topic-neutral properties have\nthe interesting feature that, while they themselves are not physical,\nbut are capable of being instantiated in what is intuitively a\ncompletely physical world, or indeed what is intuitively a completely\nspiritual world or a world entirely made of water. If so, it becomes\npossible to understand physicalism so that the reference to\n\u2018physical properties\u2019 within it is understood more\ncorrectly as \u2018physical or topic-neutral properties\u2019. \n\nA final response to the problem does not expand the notion of the\nphysical as much as it restricts the scope of physicalism to\nproperties of a certain sort. One suggestion along these lines has\nbeen made by a number of writers (e.g. Rabin 2020, following Dasgupta\n2015) in the context of grounding physicalism, though perhaps the\nunderlying idea can be extended to other varieties as well. They\nsuggest that grounding physicalism, which we formulated above as (7),\nshould be revised to take the following form:\n\n(7*)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\ngroundable property instantiated at w is either a\nphysical property or is grounded in a physical property.\n\n\nHere, a property is groundable just in case it is apt for being\ngrounded, i.e. it is the sort of property that can be either grounded\nor not. Ordinary psychological properties are presumably in this\nclass. If grounding physicalism is true, they are grounded in physical\nproperties, whereas if it is false, they are not grounded in physical\nproperties; either way, they are groundable properties. But\nmathematical properties and the properties of abstracta more generally\nmight in at least some instances not be groundable, they may\nfail to be properties that are apt for being grounded. If so, we have\nan alternative solution to the problem of abstracta: (7*) permits that\nsome properties of abstracta are not grounded in the physical, so long\nas they are ungroundable. \n5.4 Methodological Issues\n\nThe final argument I will consider against physicalism is of a more\nmethodological nature. It is sometimes suggested, not that physicalism\nis false, but that the entire \u2018project of physicalism\u2019\n\u2014 the project in philosophy of mind of debating whether\nphysicalism is true, and trying to establish or disprove its truth by\nphilosophical argument \u2014 is misguided. This sort of argument has\nbeen mounted by a number of writers, but perhaps its most vocal\nadvocate has been Noam Chomsky (2000; see also Searle 1992, 1999).\n\n\nIt is easiest to state Chomsky\u2019s criticism by beginning with two\npoints about methodological naturalism. In general it seems rational\nto agree with the methodological naturalists that the best hope for a\ntheoretical understanding of the world is by pursuing the methods\nwhich are typical of the sciences. It would then seem rational as a\nspecial case that our best hope for a theoretical understanding of\nconsciousness or experience is by pursuing the methods of the sciences\n\u2014 by pursuing, as we might put it, the naturalistic project with\nrespect to consciousness. So Chomsky\u2019s first point is that it is\nrational to pursue the naturalistic project with respect to\nconsciousness.\n\nChomsky\u2019s second point is that the physicalist project in\nphilosophy of mind is on the face of it rather different from the\nnaturalistic project. In the first place, the physicalist project is,\nas we have noted, usually thought of a piece of metaphysics. But there\nis nothing obviously metaphysical about the naturalistic project, it\nsimply raises questions about what we can hope to explain. In the\nsecond place, the physicalist project is normally thought of as being\namenable to philosophical argument, whereas it is unclear where\nphilosophical argument (if this is different from scientific argument)\nwould enter the naturalistic project. In short, there doesn\u2019t\nseem anything particularly \u2018philosophical\u2019 about the\nnaturalistic project \u2014 it simply applies the methods of science\nto consciousness. But the physicalist project is central to analytic\nphilosophy.\n\nIt is precisely at the place where the physicalist project departs\nfrom the naturalistic project that Chomsky\u2019s criticism begins to\ntake shape. For insofar as it is different from the naturalistic\nproject, there are a number of ways in which the physicalist project\nis questionable. First, it is hard to see what the project might be\n\u2014 it is true that throughout the history of philosophy and\nscience one encounters suggestions that one might find out about the\nworld in ways that are distinct from the ones used in the sciences,\nbut these suggestions have always been rather obscure. Second, it is\nhard to see how this sort of project could recommend itself to\nphysicalists themselves \u2014 such a project seems to be a\ndeparture from methodological naturalism but most physicalists endorse\nmethodological naturalism as a matter of fact. On the other hand, if\nthe physicalist project does not depart from the naturalistic project,\nthen the usual ways of talking and thinking about that project are\nhighly misleading. For example, it is misleading to speak of it as a\npiece of metaphysics as opposed to a piece of ordinary science.\n\nIn sum, Chomsky\u2019s criticism is best understood as a kind of\ndilemma. The physicalist project is either identical to the\nnaturalistic project or it is not. If it is identical, then the\nlanguage and concepts that shape the project are potentially extremely\nmisleading; but if it is not identical, then there are a number of\nways in which it is illegitimate.\n\nHow is one to respond to this criticism? In my view, the strongest\nanswer to Chomsky accepts the first horn of his dilemma and suggests\nthat what philosophers of mind are really concerned with is the\nnaturalistic project. Now, of course, what concerns them is not so\nmuch the details of the project \u2014 that would not distinguish\nthem from working scientists. Rather they are concerned with what the\nnature of the project and what its potential limits might be.\n\nThis theme might be developed in several ways, but one well-known\ndevelopment of it has been suggested by Thomas Nagel (1983) and\nBernard Williams (1985). According to them, any form of scientific\ninquiry will at least be objective, or will result in an objective\npicture of the world. On the other hand, we have a number of arguments\n\u2014 the most prominent being the knowledge argument \u2014 which\nplausibly show that there is no place for experience or qualia in a\nworld that is described in purely objective terms. If Nagel and\nWilliams are right that any form of scientific inquiry will yield a\ndescription of the world in objective terms, the knowledge argument is\nnothing less than a negative argument to the effect that the\nnaturalistic project with respect to consciousness will not\nsucceed.\n\nIf what is at issue is the limits of the naturalist project, why is\nthe debate so often construed as a metaphysical debate rather than a\ndebate about the limits of inquiry? In answer to this question, we\nneed to sharply divorce the background metaphysical framework within\nwhich the problems of philosophy of mind find their expression, and\nthe problems themselves. Physicalism is the background metaphysical\nassumption against which the problems of philosophy of mind are posed\nand discussed. Given that assumption, the question of the limits of\nthe naturalistic project just is the question of whether\nthere can be experience in a world that is totally physical.\nNevertheless, when properly understood, the problems that philosophers\nof mind are interested in are not with the framework themselves, and\nto that extent are not metaphysical. Thus, the common phrase\n\u2018metaphysics of mind\u2019 is misleading.\n6. The Case for Physicalism\n\nHaving considered one side of the truth question, I will turn finally\nto the other: what reason is there for believing that physicalism is\ntrue?\n\nThe first thing to say when considering the truth of physicalism is\nthat we live in an overwhelmingly physicalist or materialist\nintellectual culture. The result is that, as things currently stand,\nthe standards of argumentation required to persuade someone of the\ntruth of physicalism are much lower than the standards required to\npersuade someone of its negation. (The point here is a perfectly\ngeneral one: if you already believe or want something to be true, you\nare likely to accept fairly low standards of argumentation for its\ntruth.)\n\nHowever, while it might be difficult to assess dispassionately the\narguments for or against physicalism, this is still something we\nshould endeavor to do. Here I will review two arguments that are\ncommonly thought to establish the truth of physicalism. What unites\nthe arguments is that each takes something from the physicalist\nworld-picture which we considered previously and tries to establish\nthe metaphysical this of physicalism.\n\nThe first argument is (what I will call) The Argument from Causal\nClosure. The first premise of this argument is the thesis of the\nCausal Closure of the Physical \u2014 that is, the thesis that every\nevent which has a cause has a physical cause. The second premise is\nthat mental events cause physical events \u2014 for example we\nnormally think that events such as wanting to raise your arm (a mental\nevent) cause events such as the raising of your arm (a physical\nevent). The third premise of the argument is a principle of causation\nthat is often called the exclusion principle (Kim 1993, Yablo 1992,\nBennett 2003). The correct formulation of the exclusion principle is a\nmatter of some controversy but a formulation that is both simple and\nplausible is the following:\n\nExclusion Principle\n\nIf an event e causes event e*, then there is no\nevent e# such that e# is non-supervenient on\ne and e# causes e*.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is the mental events are supervenient\non physical events, or more briefly that physicalism is true. For of\ncourse, if the thesis of Causal Closure is true then behavioral events\nhave physical causes, and if mental events also cause behavioral\nevents, then they must supervene on the physical if the exclusion\nprinciple is true. \n\nThe Argument from Causal Closure is perhaps the dominant argument for\nphysicalism in the literature today. But it is somewhat unclear\nwhether it is successful. (For some discussion see,\n Mental Causation).\n One response for the anti-physicalist is to reject the second premise\nand to adopt a version of what is called epiphenomenalism, the view\nthat mental events are caused by, and yet do not cause, physical\nevents. The argument against this position is usually epistemological:\nif pains don\u2019t cause pain behavior how can it be that your\ntelling me that you are in pain gives me any reason for supposing you\nare? It might seem that epiphenomenalists are in trouble here, but as\na number of recent philosophers have argued, the issues here are very\nfar from being settled (Chalmers 1996, Hyslop 1999). The crucial point\nis that the causal theory of evidence is open to serious\ncounterexamples so it is unclear that it can be used against\nepiphenomenalism effectively.\n\nA different sort of response is to reject the causal principles on\nwhich the argument is based. As against the exclusion principle, for\nexample, it is often pointed out that certain events are\noverdetermined. The classic example is the firing squad: both the\nfiring by soldier A and by soldier B caused the prisoner\u2019s death\nbut since these are distinct firings, the exclusion principle is\nfalse. However, while this line of response is suggestive, it is in\nfact rather limited. It is true that the case of the firing squad\nrepresents an exception to the exclusion principle \u2014 an\nexception that the principle must be emended to accommodate. But is\ndifficult to believe that it represents an exception that can be\nwidespread. A more searching response is to reject the very idea of\ncausal closure on the grounds, perhaps, that (as Bertrand Russell\n(1917) famously argued) causation plays no role in a mature portrayal\nof the world. Once again, however, the promise of this response is\nmore imagined than real. While it is true that many sciences do not\nexplicitly use the notion of causation, it is extremely unlikely that\nthey do not imply that various causal claims are true.\n\nThe second argument for physicalism is (what I will call) The\nArgument from Methodological Naturalism. The first premise of\nthis argument is that it is rational to be guided in one\u2019s\nmetaphysical commitments by the methods of natural science. Lying\nbehind this premise are the arguments of Quine and others that\nmetaphysics should not be approached in a way that is distinct from\nthe sciences but should rather be thought of as continuous with it.\nThe second premise of the argument is that, as a matter of fact, the\nmetaphysical picture of the world that one is led to by the methods of\nnatural science is physicalism. The conclusion is that it is rational\nto believe physicalism, or, more briefly that physicalism is true.\n\nThe Argument from Methodological Naturalism has received somewhat less\nattention in the literature than the Argument from Causal Closure. But\nit seems just as persuasive \u2014 in fact, rather more so. For how\nmight one respond? One possibility is to reject its first premise. But\nthis is not something that most people are attracted to (or at least\nare attracted to explicitly.)\n\nThe other possibility is to reject its second premise. However, if\nphysicalism can be clearly stated \u2014 admittedly, this is a big\n\u2018if\u2019 \u2014 it is not terribly clear what this would\namount to or what the motivation for it would be. In the first place,\nour earlier discussion shows that physicalism is not inconsistent with\nexplanatory autonomy of the various sciences, so that one should not\nreject physicalism merely because one can\u2019t see how to reduce\nthose sciences to others. In the second place, while it is perfectly\ntrue that there are examples of non-physicalist approaches to the\nworld \u2014 vitalism in biology is perhaps the best example \u2014\nthis is beside the point. The second premise of the Argument from\nMethodological Naturalism does not deny that other views are possible,\nit simply says that physicalism is the most likely view at the moment.\nFinally, one might be inclined to appeal to arguments such as the\nknowledge argument to show that physicalism is false, and hence that\nmethodological naturalism could not show that physicalism is false.\nHowever, this suggestion represents a sort of confusion about the\nknowledge argument. As we saw above, if successful the knowledge\nargument suggests, not simply that physicalism is false but that any\napproach to the world that is compatible with methodological\nnaturalism is false. But if that is so, it is mistaken to suppose that\nthe knowledge argument gives one any reason to endorse\nanti-physicalism if that is supposed to be a position compatible with\nmethodological naturalism.\n",
