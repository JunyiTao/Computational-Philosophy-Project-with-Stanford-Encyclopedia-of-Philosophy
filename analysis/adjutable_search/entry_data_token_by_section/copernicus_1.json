    "main_text": "Astronomical Ideas and Writings || Pre-Copernican Astronomy\n2.1 Pre-Copernican Astronomy\n\nClassical astronomy followed principles established by Aristotle.\nAristotle accepted the idea that there were four physical elements\n\u2013 earth, water, air, and fire. He put the earth in the center of\nthe universe and contended that these elements were below the moon,\nwhich was the closest celestial body. There were seven planets, or\nwandering stars, because they had a course through the zodiac in\naddition to traveling around the earth: the moon, Mercury, Venus, the\nsun, Mars, Jupiter. Beyond that were the fixed stars. The physical\nelements, according to Aristotle moved vertically, depending on their\n\u2018heaviness\u2019 or \u2018gravity\u2019; the celestial bodies\nwere not physical but a \u2018fifth element\u2019 or\n\u2018quintessence\u2019 whose nature was to move in perfect circles\naround the earth, making a daily rotation. Aristotle envisioned the\nearth as the true center of all the circles or \u2018orbs\u2019\ncarrying the heavenly bodies around it and all motion as\n\u2018uniform,\u2019 that is, unchanging.\n\nBut observers realized that the heavenly bodies did not move as\nAristotle postulated. The earth was not the true center of the orbits\nand the motion was not uniform. The most obvious problem was that the\nouter planets seemed to stop, move backwards in\n\u2018retrograde\u2019 motion for a while, and then continue\nforwards. By the second century, when Ptolemy compiled his\nAlmagest (this common name of Ptolemy\u2019s\nSyntaxis was derived from its Arabic title), astronomers had\ndeveloped the concept that the orbit moves in \u2018epicycles\u2019\naround a \u2018deferrent,\u2019 that is, they move like a flat\nheliacal coil around a circle around the earth. The earth was also\noff-center, on an \u2018eccentric,\u2019 as the heavenly bodies\nmoved around a central point. Ptolemy added a point on a straight line\nopposite the eccentric, which is called the \u2018equalizing\npoint\u2019 or the \u2018equant,\u2019 and around this point the\nheavenly bodies moved uniformly. Moreover, unlike the Aristotelian\nmodel, Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest did not describe a unified\nuniverse. The ancient astronomers who followed Ptolemy, however, were\nnot concerned if his system did not describe the \u2018true\u2019\nmotions of the heavenly bodies; their concern was to \u2018save the\nphenomena,\u2019 that is, give a close approximation of where the\nheavenly bodies would be at a given point in time. And in an age\nwithout professional astronomers, let alone the telescope, Ptolemy did\na good job plotting the courses of the heavenly bodies.\n\nNot all Greek astronomical ideas followed this geocentric system.\nPythagoreans suggested that the earth moved around a central fire (not\nthe sun). Archimedes wrote that Aristarchus of Samos actually proposed\nthat the earth rotated daily and revolved around the\n sun.[3]\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, the Islamic world was the center of\nastronomical thought and activity. During the ninth century several\naspects of Ptolemy\u2019s solar theory were recalculated. Ibn\nal-Haytham in the tenth-eleventh century wrote a scathing critique of\nPtolemy\u2019s work: \u201cPtolemy assumed an arrangement that\ncannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his\nimagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him\nfrom the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the\nexisting motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement\nthat is impossible to exist\u201d (quoted in Rosen 1984, 174).\nSwerdlow and Neugebauer (46\u201348) stressed that the\nthirteenth-century Maragha school was also important in finding errors\nand correcting Ptolemy: \u201cThe method of the Maragha planetary\nmodels was to break up the equant motion in Ptolemy\u2019s models\ninto two or more components of uniform circular motion, physically the\nuniform rotation of spheres, that together control the direction and\ndistance of the center of the epicycle, so that it comes to lie in\nnearly the same position it would have in Ptolemy\u2019s model, and\nalways moves uniformly with respect to the equant.\u201d They found\nthat Copernicus used devices that had been developed by the Maragha\nastronomers Nasir al-Din Tusi (1201\u20131274), Muayyad al-Din\nal-Urdi (d. 1266), Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236\u20131311), and Ibn\nal-Shatir (1304\u20131375). In addition, Ragep, 2005, has shown that\na theory for the inner planets presented by Regiomontanus that enabled\nCopernicus to convert the planets to eccentric models had been\ndeveloped by the fifteenth-century, Samarqand-trained astronomer ali\nQushji\n (1403\u20131474).[4]\n\nRenaissance humanism did not necessarily promote natural philosophy,\nbut its emphasis on mastery of classical languages and texts had the\nside effect of promoting the sciences. Georg Peurbach\n(1423\u20131461) and (Johannes M\u00fcller) Regiomontanus\n(1436\u20131476) studied Greek for the purpose of producing an\noutline of Ptolemaic astronomy. By the time Regiomontanus finished the\nwork in 1463, it was an important commentary on the Almagest\nas well, pointing out, for example, that Ptolemy\u2019s lunar theory\ndid not accord with observations. He noted that Ptolemy showed the\nmoon to be at various times twice as far from the earth as at other\ntimes, which should make the moon appear twice as big. At the time,\nmoreover, there was active debate over Ptolemy\u2019s deviations from\nAristotle\u2019s requirement of uniform circular motion.\n",
