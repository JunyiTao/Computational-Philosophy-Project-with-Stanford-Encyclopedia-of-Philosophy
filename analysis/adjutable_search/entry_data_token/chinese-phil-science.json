Stereotypes of Chinese philosophy as\nconsisting almost entirely of Confucianism and claims that Confucians\nwere not interested in science add to this perception.\n\nFor example, in a recent correspondence in the journal\nNature, Peng Gong, a research scientist at Tsinghua University\nand the University of California, Berkeley gives the following harsh\nassessment of the effect of Chinese philosophy on the development of\nscience in China:\n\nTwo cultural genes have passed through generations of Chinese\nintellectuals for more than 2,000 years. The first is the thoughts of\nConfucius, who proposed that intellectuals should become loyal\nadministrators. The second is the writings of Zhuang Zhou, who said\nthat a harmonious society would come from isolating families so as to\navoid exchange and conflict, and by shunning technology to avoid greed.\nTogether, these cultures have encouraged small-scale and\nself-sufficient practices in Chinese society, but discouraged\ncuriosity, commercialization and technology. They helped to produce a\nscientific void in Chinese society that persisted for millennia. And\nthey continue to be relevant today (Gong 2012).\n\nIs this a fair account? Is Chinese philosophy in some sense\nanti-science? Does it contribute to science in ways that constitute a\n\u201cChinese science\u201d that is different from modern\nscience. Or is the history of science in China part of a\nuniversal science?\n\nThis essay addresses relations between science and Chinese\nphilosophy in several ways. It begins with a detailed argument by the\ninfluential historian of Chinese philosophy Fung Yu-lan almost one\nhundred years ago, claiming that there is no science in China because\nthere is no need for any. The second section presents an opposing\nview from the history of science as presented by Joseph Needham and\nothers, introducing a range of sciences that developed in China, with\nwhat might be called distinctive Chinese characteristics. The\nthird section addresses the particular problem of Needham's\nrepresentation of Chinese science as significantly Daoist.\n\n\nThe next two sections attempt to historicize and reconcile these two\nhistories, one philosophical and one scientific, by turning to the\nintellectual and social contexts for the development of science in\nChina. The fourth section focuses on concepts shared by the\npractitioners and texts of early philosophy and science. The\nfifth section turns to an intellectual divergence between generalist\nand technical specialist knowledge through the categorization of texts\nin a chapter of the dynastic history of the Han dynasty (Han\nshu). The sixth section takes up the social context of the\npractitioners of the early sciences and their relations to\nphilosophical texts and traditions. The last section surveys the\nearly sciences, with specific interest in areas of close relationship\nbetween the sciences and Chinese philosophy, especially in the areas of\ncosmology, astronomy, mathematics and medicine.\n", "toc": [{"#FunYuLanWhyChiHasNoSci": "1.

Fung Yu-lan's \u201cWhy China Has No Science\u201d\n\nIn a paper titled \u201cWhy China Has No Science,\u201d published\nin 1922, Fung Yu-lan [Feng Youlan] \u99ae\u53cb\u862d\n(1895\u20131990), then a student of John Dewey, argued that: \u201cwhat\nkeeps China back is that she has no science,\u201d but that:\n\u201cChina has no science, because according to her own standard of\nvalue she does not need any.\u201d(1922, 237 and 238). To make\nthis argument, he introduces what he calls two tendencies in Chinese\nphilosophy, which he calls \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cart\u201d\nor \u201chuman,\u201d referring to the products of human\nartifice. On his account, the Warring States period (475\u2013221 BCE)\ndeveloped two philosophies, Daoism and Mohism respectively, which\nfollowed these two tendencies to extreme, and a third, Confucianism,\nwhich he represents as a compromise between them. On Fung's\nexplanation, the Daoists considered nature perfect while the Mohists\nsought to improve on it (1922, 238\u201339). They valued utility above all\nelse, and Fung considers them \u201cscientific\u201d in spirit,\nincluding their interest in logic and definition. Mohism, as he\nputs it, stood for art as over against nature (1922, 244\u201350). He\ndoes not explain how his \u201cConfucianism\u201d is a compromise\nbetween these two extremes, all the more so since he distinguishes the\n\u201cnature\u201d oriented Confucianism of Mencius (372\u2013289 BCE)\nfrom the \u201cart\u201d-oriented Confucianism of Xunzi (313-238\nBCE), who aspired to conquer nature instead of returning to it:\n\u201cIt is better to treat nature as a thing and regulate it than to\nconsider it very great and always think of it. It is better to control\nnature and use it than to follow and admire it.\u201d This, Fung\nremarks, is nearly the same as the Baconian conception of power\n(1922, 256, quoting from an unspecified passage in the\n\u201cDiscourse on Heaven\u201d (Tian lun) chapter of the\nXunzi. For a study of this chapter see Machle 1993).\n\nFung goes on to argue that, after the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BCE) the\n\u201cart\u201d or scientific tendency within Chinese philosophy all\nbut disappeared. Buddhism, like Daoism, was an extreme\n\u201cnature\u201d philosophy, and the interactions of Daoism,\nBuddhism and Confucianism did not produce interest in the understanding\nof the natural world. In the tenth century CE the Song Neo-Confucians\ncombined Daoist, Confucian and Buddhist teachings into a new philosophy\nthat has persisted to the present. According to the \u201cGreat\nLearning\u201d (Da xue), the ancients who wished to enlighten\ntheir bright virtue \u201cinvestigated things\u201d:\n\nWishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the\nutmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the\ninvestigation of things (zhi zhi zai ge wu\n\u81f4\u77e5\u5728\u683c\u7269). Things being investigated,\nknowledge became complete (Da xue, 412).\n\nBut Neo-Confucian philosophers disagreed about what\n\u201cthings\u201d to investigate. Some took\n\u201cthings\u201d as external, but did not pursue the investigation\nof the empirical world. The other, prevailing view took\n\u201cthings\u201d to refer to the mind. Fung points out that\nthe Song dynasty (960\u20131279) corresponded to the period of the\ndevelopment of modern science in Europe, but Europeans developed\ntechniques for understanding and controlling matter, while the Chinese\nNeo-Confucians developed techniques for understanding and controlling\nmind (1922, 256\u201358).\n\nThe point of this discussion of Fung's study is his argument that,\never since the disappearance of the \u201cnature\u201d tendency,\nChinese philosophy has devoted itself to the cultivation of the mind\n(xin \u5fc3), at the expense of any interest in, or need\nfor, science, or any inquiry into nature. (Because the meaning of\nxin \u2013 \u201cmind,\u201d or more properly\n\u201cheart-mind\u201d \u2013 is much broader than the English term\nmind, cultivating it refers to a much broader kind of cognitive,\nintellectual, physical and spiritual cultivation than the phrase\n\u201ccultivation of the mind\u201d suggests.) By contrast, he\nargues, the ancestors of modern European philosophy had two\n\u201cuses\u201d for science: according to Descartes, it provided\ncertainty; according to Bacon, it offered power. But, Fung\nargues, China did not discover the scientific method because Chinese\nthought started from the mind, and did not require proof or logical or\nempirical demonstration. Instead, Chinese philosophers preferred\nthe certainty of perception, and thus: \u201cwould not, and did not\ntranslate their concrete vision into the form of science. In one word\nChina has no science, because of all philosophies the Chinese\nphilosophy is the most human and the most practical\u201d (1922,\n260). Fung concludes: \u201cit is because of the fact that the\nChinese ideal prefers enjoyment to power that China has no need of\nscience, even though science, according to Bacon, is for power. The\nChinese philosophers, as I said just now, had no need of scientific\ncertainty, because it was themselves that they wished to know; so in\nthe same way they had no need of the power of science, because it was\nthemselves that they wished to conquer\u201d (1922, 261).\n\nIn summary, although Fung Yu-lan's account of Warring States\nphilosophy is open to question, he gives a compelling version of a type\nof claim for philosophical reasons why science did not develop in\nChina. I now turn to the opposite argument that science did\ndevelop \u2013 and flourish \u2013 in both early China and the Song\n\u201cNeo-Confucian\u201d period.\n2. Joseph Needham's History of Science in China\n\nThe question of the relation of Chinese philosophy and science is\ncomplicated by several factors. One is the need to define what we mean\nby science in the context of early China and early Chinese\nphilosophy. This question includes the relationship of\n\u201cscience\u201d to \u201ctechnology,\u201d as well as the\nquestion of what disciplines were considered sciences, and where they\nstood in indigenous hierarchies of knowledge.\n\nThese questions partake of an ongoing debate on the nature of\nChinese science, which initially arose from the pioneering work of\nJoseph Needham. This debate focuses on the problematic question\nof why (or whether) the revolution that transformed scientific\ndisciplines in Europe did not take place in China. It has tended\nto focus on the mathematization of science and on the activities of\ncourt astronomical officials (Needham 1956b, 1979). But these debates\ndo little to clarify the relations between the origins and development\nof the sciences in China and Chinese philosophy.\n\nThis debate about the nature of Chinese science, which has been\nreferred to as the \u201cNeedham problem,\u201d has focused on\nvariants on the important question of why (or whether) the scientific\nrevolution that transformed scientific disciplines in Europe did not\ntake place in China. In Needham's terms, the answers lie in the history\nof Chinese science itself, but Fung Yu-lan's argument provides an\nanswer of a very different kind, which Needham would probably not\nentertain at all. (Although Needham's (1956b) own account of the\nhistory of Chinese philosophy and science repeatedly cites the\nscholarship of Fung Yu-lan, especially Fung 1983, he makes no mention\nof Fung 1922.)\n\nNeedham, himself an eminent embryologist (Needham 1931, 1934) was\nthe primary author of the multi-volume ongoing Science and\nCivilisation in China (1954- ). His approach to the problem\nof the history of science in China was to try to fit the Chinese\nscientific tradition into the categories of twentieth-century western\nscience. On the one hand, this approach enabled Needham and his\ncollaborators to engage the wealth and variety of the many Chinese\nsciences from a perspective that took them seriously as contributors to\nan ongoing and universal history of science. This approach also\nallowed Needham's group to consistently and coherently refute\n\u201corientalist\u201d claims or prima facie assumptions that\nscience was the sole property of a European tradition extending\nbackward in time to ancient Greece, with little or no influence from\nany other cultural tradition. On the other hand, Needham's\n\u201cuniversalist\u201d approach to the history of science in China\nhas been rejected as anachronistic and culturally inappropriate (Yates\n2003, 658).\n\nAs Nathan Sivin (1990 and 1995) has argued, Chinese accounts focused\non specific sciences, rather than on one unified notion of science.\nThese Chinese sciences were both quantitative and qualitative. Sivin\n(1982 and 1990) breaks down the quantitative sciences into three\ndisciplines: mathematics (suan \u7b97), mathematical\nharmonics or acoustics (l\u00fc \u5f8b or l\u00fc\nl\u00fc \u5f8b\u5442) and mathematical astronomy (li\n\u6b77 or li fa \u6b77\u6cd5), considered related to\nharmonics. Sivin describes the qualitative sciences as: astronomy\nor astrology (tian wen \u5929\u6587), medicine\n(yi \u91ab) and siting (feng shui\n\u98a8\u6c34). Tian wen included the observation of\ncelestial and meteorological events whose proper reading could be used\nto rectify the political order. Medicine included \u201cNurturing\nLife\u201d (yang sheng \u990a\u751f), a broad category\nthat included a wide range of self-cultivation techniques with\nimportant philosophical implications. In later periods, medicine also\nincluded materia medica (ben cao \u672c\u8349) and\ninternal (nei dan \u5167\u4e39) and external (wai\ndan \u5916\u4e39) alchemy.\n3. Chinese Science as \u201cDaoist\u201d?\n\nThe \u201cNeedham\u201d problem overlaps, but is distinct from two\nother issues. One is the Chinese philosophical attitudes towards\n\u201cnature.\u201d Geoffrey Lloyd and Nathan Sivin (2002) note that\n\u201cnature\u201d was not a conceptual category in early China. Derk\nBodde (1991) distinguished at least seven premodern Chinese attitudes\ntoward what contemporary philosophy and science call nature, ranging\nfrom antagonistic and indifferent to wholly receptive. Nonetheless,\nBodde \u2013 for slightly different reasons than Fung \u2013 argued\nthat a wide range of obstacles hindered the development of science in\nChina. These included: a written language ill adapted to the expression\nof scientific ideas, attitudes toward space and time that were out of\nstep with the facts of nature (1991, 133), and the combined influence\nof an authoritarian imperial government, a conservative academic elite\nand a philosophical tradition preoccupied with morals and burdened by\n\u201corganicist\u201d thinking. Robin Yates (2003) has also noted\nthe importance of the lack of an ex nihilo creator deity and the\n\u201cnon-privileged\u201d status of humans in the cosmos of early\nChinese philosophy. Humans were not distinct from other natural\nphenomena, and were part of a dao that was ultimately\nmysterious and incomprehensible.\n\nThe other is the topic of this essay: the problem of the specific\nengagement between science and early Chinese philosophy, and whether\nChinese philosophy was in some way inimical to scientific inquiry. To\nanswer the latter questions it is necessary to consider both the\nintellectual and social contexts of Chinese philosophy and Chinese\nscience. Which sciences are relevant to Chinese philosophy? Using\nSivin's categorization, the quantitative sciences are largely separate\nfrom the engagement between science and early Chinese philosophy. The\ngreatest degree of engagement between philosophy and science comes from\nthe qualitative sciences of astronomy (or astrology) and medicine.\n\nHow do we reconcile these two entirely different accounts, one by a\nChinese philosopher and the other by several eminent historians of\nscience in China? Part of the answer lies in clarifying several\nshared intellectual contexts for the origins of science in China, as\nwell as several intellectual and social contexts that fostered their\ncomplete divergence, probably by the end of the Han dynasty (206\nBCE-220 CE).\n\n\nChinese philosophy is often identified with\n\u201cConfucianism,\u201d understood to include both the teachings of\nthe historical Confucius, his immediate intellectual descendants in the\nWarring States and Han periods, and later developments known as\nNeo-Confucianism in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties and the present\nday. One source of this view is the explicit adoption of\nConfucian ideologies by the rulers of most but not all dynasties. \nAnother is the intellectual sympathies of many generations of Chinese\ncommentators, and also of particularly Anglophone Sinologists who have\ntended to focus on Confucian philosophies. Confucian philosophers\n\u2013 as distinct from rulers of a broadly Confucian persuasion\n\u2013 were often portrayed as humanists in the sense that they were\nmore interested in problems of ethics and society than in the\ninvestigation of the natural world. This is very much the picture\npresented by Bodde in his negative assessment of the potential for\nscience in premodern China.\n\n\nBut a perception that the history of engagement between philosophy\nand science is limited to \u201cConfucianism,\u201d would present\nonly a partial picture. It is widely recognized that the earliest of\nwhat we would call scientific studies were conducted by the early\nMohists, who wrote treatises on logic, optics and mechanics (Graham\n1978, Needham 1956b, Fung 1922). Mohism did not persist beyond the Han\ndynasty as a textual lineage, but at least some Mohist texts are\npreserved in the Daoist Canon (discussed below). As such,\nwhile Mohism is fundamentally important to any history of science in\nChina, it is not central to an account of the engagement between\nscience and Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nNeedham \u2013 in complete contrast to Fung Yu-lan \u2013\nrepresents the Daoists as both naturalistic and interested in natural\nphenomena. He described Daoism as \u201creligious and poetical,\nyes; but it was also at least as strongly magical, scientific,\ndemocratic, and politically revolutionary\u201d (1956a, 32). On\nthis reading, the history of Daoism also presents a very different\npicture of science and medicine, especially.\n\n\nBut there are several problems with this picture. An initial\nproblem is anachronistic understandings of the nature of early Daoism.\nThese include an oversimplified emphasis on the schools and legendary\nauthors of Daoist texts. There is also a problematic distinction\nbetween the so-called \u201cphilosophical\u201d Daoism (Dao\njia \u9053\u5bb6) of the Daode jing,\nZhuangzi, and Huainanzi and the so-called\n\u201creligious\u201d Daoism (Dao jiao \u9053\u6559) of\nlongevity practices, popular religion, and organized Daoist churches.\nAs Sivin (1978, 1995b) pointed out in a series of article begun over\nthirty years ago, simplistic stereotypes of Daoism as mystical or\nnaturalistic obscure understanding of the relations between Daoism and\nscience.\n\n\nSivin (1995a) points to important differences between popular\nreligion and specifically Daoist religious movements that had little\nconection to either philosophy or the study of nature. His point\nis that most scientific and technical expertise arose from popular\nsources and not from Daoist schools; and once this key distinction is\nmade, we no longer need to mis-classify all or most Chinese science as\nDaoist (as did Needham). This move also allows us to clarify that\nsome Daoist masters, whose objective was union with divinity, were not\npursuing the study of rational inquiry or systematic\nexperimentation. Rather, they were making use of existing\ntechnical knowledge and practices, and adapting them to their own ends,\nbut not generally improving on them in any way. However, the\nimportant point is that the Daoist schools kept written records, which\nthe artisans who developed the original expertise, did not. As a\nresult, historians of science have tended to credit the Daoists with\ninnovations that they probably recorded, rather than developed.\n\n\nSivin\u2019s account usefully explains why the fact that many records\nof scientific innovation appear only in the Daoist Canon does\nnot make them inherently Daoist.  The Daoist Canon  (Dao\nzang \u9053\u85cf) was first printed in about 1477, and was\nreprinted in a commercial edition in 1924\u20131926. The original\nedition consisted of some 5,305 volumes, on a wide range of subjects,\nincluding astronomy and cosmology, biology and botany, medicine and\npharmacology, chemistry and mineralogy, and mathematics and\nphysics. Much of the engagement with science after the Han dynasty is\nrelegated the \u201cnon-philosophical\u201d texts classified as\nDao jiao, and often in ways that obscure the relation between\nphilosophy and science in early China.\n4. Shared Intellectual Contexts\n\n\nThere were important differences between the social and\ninstitutional contexts of early philosophy and science, as well as\nimportant differences between sciences. The authors of\nphilosophical or \u201cMasters\u201d texts (discussed below) were\nprivate individuals who often sought, but rarely achieved political\ninfluence. By contrast, astronomy and calendrics in particular were\nclosely linked to government and court patronage, and from Han times\non, located in the Bureau of Astronomy (Loewe 1994, Pankenier 2013,\nRaphals 2013, Sivin 2009).\n\n\nThe origins of science in China seem to lie in an amalgam of ideas\nfrom both Masters textualists (philosophers) and technical\nspecialists.  According to Sivin (1988 and 1990) the basic Chinese\nsciences were established some time between the first century BCE and\nthe first century CE through what he describes as a combination of Ru\n(\u201cConfucian\u201d) ideas and ideas from technical specialists,\nespecially experts in yin-yang, Five Agents (wu xing) and\ntechnical expertise traditions associated with \u201cNumbers and\nTechniques\u201d (shu shu) and \u201cRecipes and\nMethods\u201d (fang ji, both discussed below.)\n\n\nKey to this amalgam were several concepts shared by both groups but\ndeployed in very different ways. Early cosmological thinking\ndepicts a cosmos ultimately composed of qi \u6c23 (the\nenergy that constitutes and organizes matter and causes growth and\nchange) in processes of constant change, based on the interactions of\nyin and yang \u9670\u967d and the Five Agents (wu xing\n\u4e94\u884c, Graham 1986, Raphals 1998 and 2013).\n\n\nPhilosophers deployed these ideas in (1) the yin-yang cosmology of\nthe Yi jing, (2) theories of correlative correspondence\nbetween Heaven, Earth and Humanity as a shared representation of cosmic\norder, and (3) the idea of a \u201cclassic\u201d or\n\u201ccanon\u201d as the founding text of a textual lineage.\nPractitioners of several sciences also deployed these concepts, in\nparticular in models of the human body and of the movements of the sun,\nmoon and stars.\n\n\nFinally, both groups created textual lineages and accounts of\ntextual authority. In a scientific context, authoritative texts\nwere nominally attributed to a culture hero or divine source. \nExamples include the medical \u201cclassic\u201d The Yellow\nEmperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di nei\njing, Unschuld 2003, Unschuld and Tessenow 2011) and the Zhou\n[dynasty] Classic of Gnomon Calculation (Zhou bi suan\njing, Cullen 1976 and 1996). By contrast, the evidence of\nrecently excavated texts indicates that such texts derived from prior\ntextual traditions that were subsequently lost (Harper 1998). Other\nMasters created their own texts and apocryphal lineages, but did not\nappear to have debated each other extensively or to have taken\nself-consciously critical stances toward their human or textual\npredecessors (Lloyd 1996, Lloyd and Sivin 2002).\n5. Generalist versus Specialist Knowledge\n\n\nNo one account categorizes the sciences of early China, but we find\nsome account of them in the last two sections of the Bibliographic\nTreatise of the Han Dynastic History (Han shu, chapter 30). We see in\nthe categorizations and authorship of the Treatise a polarization\nbetween two groups whom can be called Masters textualists and technical\nexperts.\n\n\nThe Han shu Bibliographic Treatise consists of six\nsections: (1) the Six Arts (liu yi \u516d\u85dd) or\nClassics (liu jing \u516d\u7d93), (2) Masters (zhu\nzi \u8af8\u5b50) texts of Warring States philosophy, (3)\nPoetry (shi fu \u8a69\u8ce6), (4) Military works (bing\nshu \u5175\u66f8), (5) Numbers and Techniques (shu\nshu \u6578\u8853), and (6) Recipes and Methods (fang\nji \u65b9\u6280).\n\n\nThe \u201cNumbers and Techniques\u201d (shu shu) section\nincludes the names of texts on astronomy, and cosmology in the sections\ntitled Patterns of Heaven (tian wen \u5929\u6587) and\nCalendars and Chronologies (li pu \u6b77\u8b5c).\nAdditional information appears under sections titled Five Agents\n(wu xing \u4e94\u884c), and morphoscopy. Patterns of\nHeaven includes texts on divination by stars and weather phenomena\n(clouds, mists, qi configurations), and mapping the constellations.\nCalendars and Chronologies includes texts on calendric computations and\nmovements of the heavenly bodies. Five Agents also contains mantic\ntexts concerning prognostication by yin and yang and the Five Agents,\nincluding portents, hemerology, calendric astrology. A subsection\ntitled Turtle and Yarrow (shi gui \u84cd\u9f9c) contains\ntexts on turtle-shell and yarrow divination, including the Zhou yi\n(Zhou Changes), the original text of the Yi jing or\nBook of Changes. Two other subsections address Miscellaneous\nDivination (za zhan \u96dc\u5360) and Morphoscopy\n(xing fa \u5211\u6cd5), including works on geography,\nphysiognomy, and topomancy.\n\n\nInformation on medicine and pharmacology appears in the sixth\nsection, Recipes and Methods. It includes works on medicine and\nlongevity, including medical classics, classical recipes, sexual arts,\nand immortality practices. These chapters reflect the concerns and\nexpertise of the technical and ritual specialists closely associated\nwith the \u201cRecipe Masters\u201d (fang shi\n\u65b9\u58eb) associated with the Han court. But their concerns\nalso appear in early philosophical texts, and the separation of\nphilosophy from the categories of religion and science is artificial\nand problematic (Harper 1998 and 1999; Kalinowski 2004). Recipes and\nMethods (fang ji \u65b9\u6280) includes: Medical Classics\n(yi jing \u91ab\u7d93), Classical Recipes (jing\nfang \u7d93\u65b9), Sexual arts (fang zhong\n\u623f\u4e2d) and Immortality practices (shen xian\n\u795e\u4ed9).\n\n\nSeveral things are striking about this categorization. The first is\nthe relative confinement of \u201cChinese philosophy\u201d to the\nfirst two (or arguably three) sections of the Treatise, particularly\nthe Masters section. The eight sections of the Masters category include\nmost of the texts of early Chinese philosophy. They are grouped under\nthe rubrics of: \u201cRu\u201d (Ru jia \u5112\u5bb6,\noften mistranslated as \u201cConfucian\u201d), Daoists (Dao\njia \u9053\u5bb6), Yin-yang (Yin-yang jia\n\u9670\u967d\u5bb6), Legalists (Fa jia\n\u6cd5\u5bb6), Names (Ming jia \u540d\u5bb6) Mohists\n(Mo jia \u58a8\u5bb6), vertical and horizontal alliances\n(Zong heng jia \u7e31\u6a6b\u5bb6, also known as\n\u201cMilitarists\u201d), Miscellaneous (Za jia\n\u96dc\u5bb6), the school of Shen Nong (Shen Nong jia\n\u795e\u8fb2\u5bb6) and Smaller Teachings (Xiao Shuo\n\u5c0f\u8aaa). But it is important to note that these are the\n\u201cschools\u201d of Han anthologists and commentators. Recent\nscholarship and the evidence of texts excavated from tombs has shown\nthe arbitrariness of these classifications. For example, texts\nexcavated from Guodian \u90ed\u5e97 and the so-called Shanghai\nMuseum texts resist classification as Ru or Daoist (Shi ji,\n130, 3288\u201392; Csikszentmihalyi and Nylan 2003, Smith 2003).\n\n\nA second important point is the very different preservation and\nauthorship of the first and second half of the Treatise. While the\nfirst three sections contain many titles that are no longer extant,\nthey all contain significant numbers of extant texts. By contrast, the\nlast three sections consist almost entirely of the titles of lost\ntexts.\n\n\nThe two halves of the treatise also differ in their authorship. The\nfirst three sections were compiled by Liu Xiang. The last three, by\ncontrast, were compiled by technical experts. The fourth\n\u201cMilitary Works\u201d section of the Bibliographic Treatise was\ncompiled by Ren Hong \u4efb\u5b8f, a Colonel of Foot Soldiers under\nHan Chengdi (Yates 1988). The \u201cShu shu\u201d category\nwas compiled by an astronomical official: the Taishi\n\u592a\u53f2 Yin Xian \u5c39\u54b8 (Han shu, 30,\n1775). The Recipes and Methods section was compiled by the imperial\nphysician Li Zhuguo \u674e\u67f1\u570b. This distinction between\nwhat appear to be three generalist and three specialist categories of\nthe Treatise can be seen as a continuation of Warring States claims for\nthe superiority of a flexible and general intellect over specific and\ntechnical arts. In this kind of Warring States argumentation, claims\nfor comprehensive wisdom and universality sought to establish sole\npossession of way of the sage kings of antiquity, of which competing\ntraditions possessed only part. Such claims appear in the\nZhuangzi and in attacks on competing schools by Xunzi and Han\nFei (Lewis 1999, Raphals 2008\u20132009). Thus the authors of Han\ncollectanea privileged generalists in their comprehensive syntheses of\ncompeting traditions (Lewis 1999). In this way, the organization of the\nTreatise asserted the superiority of general and universal knowledge\nover military, mantic, and medical knowledge, deliberately framed as\ntechnical and limited in nature.\n\n\nFinally, Masters texts suggest active competition between the\ntextual specialists of the Masters schools and the technical experts\nwhose knowledge and expertise is reflected in the last three sections\nof the Treatise. This competition involved career choice, patronage,\nstudents and the status of genres and modes of knowledge. For\nexample, Michael Puett (2002) argues for an interwoven history of\ninteractions between fang shi and the court officials in which\ncourt sponsored interpretations of ancient philosophical texts were in\npart a response to the fang shi.\n\n\nLate Warring States claims for the superiority of a flexible and\ngeneral intellect over specific and technical arts continued into the\nHan dynasty. In particular, claims for universal and comprehensive\nwisdom sought to establish sole possession of way of the sage kings of\nantiquity, of which competing traditions possessed only part. This\nattitude is reflected in the structure of Han collectanea, which also\nprivileged general and universal knowledge over any specialist\nexpertise, including science. The result is the formation and\npropagation of two distinct and sometimes competing intellectual\ncommunities of \u201cphilosophical\u201d literary elites and\ntechnical experts.\n6. Social Contexts of Practitioners\n\n\nThere were important differences between the social and\ninstitutional contexts of early philosophy and science, as well as\nimportant differences between sciences. Masters textualists were\nprivate individuals who often sought, but rarely achieved political\ninfluence. By contrast, astronomy and calendrics in particular were\nclosely linked to government and court patronage, and from Han times\non, located in the Bureau of Astronomy (Loewe 1994, Raphals 2013, Sivin\n2009).\n\n\nA closer examination of what we know of some of the early\n\u201cscientists\u201d shows close links to philosophical traditions.\nThe apocryphal founder of scientific thought in China was Zou Yan\n\u9112\u884d (305\u2013240 BCE), who is associated with the so-called\n\u201cYin-Yang school\u201d (Yin-yang jia). Zou Yan is credited with\ncombining and systematizing yin-yang and the theory of Five Agents\n(Needham 1956b: 231\u201334), but none of his works survive. Sima\nQian\u2019s biography in Shi ji 76 describes Zou Yan as a\nmember of the Jixia \u7a37\u4e0b Academy, originally from the state\nof Qi (in present day Shandong). The Jixia Academy is also associated\nwith Warring States philosophers. Figures associated with it include\nMencius, Xunzi, the Mohist philosopher Song Xing, as well as Tian Pian,\nShen Dao, Peng Meng, and possibly Zhuangzi (Needham 1956a, 93; Sato\n2003, 75\u201377). The Jixia Academy is also associated with the growth of\nHuang-Lao Daoism (Graziani 2008). According to the Shi ji\nbiography of Zou Yan:\n\nhe examined deeply into the phenomena of the increase and decrease\nof yin and yang, and wrote essays totaling more than 100,000 words\nabout their strange permutations, and about the cycles of the great\nsages from beginning to end. His sayings were vast and far-reaching,\nand not in accord with the accepted beliefs of the classics. First he\nhad to examine small objects, and from these he drew conclusions about\nlarge ones, until he reached what was without limit. First he spoke\nabout modern times, and from this he went back to the time of Huang Di.\nThe scholars all studied his arts. Moreover he followed the great\nevents in the rise and fall of ages, and by means of their omens and\n(an examination into their systems), extended his survey (still\nfurther) backwards to the time when the heavens and the earth had not\nyet been born, (in fact) to what was profound and abstruse and\nimpossible to investigate.\n\nHe began by classifying China\u2019s notable mountains, great\nrivers and connecting valleys; its birds and beasts; the fruitfulness\nof its water and soils, and its rare products; and from this extended\nhis survey to what is beyond the seas, and men are unable to observe.\nThen starting from the time of the separation of the Heavens and the\nEarth, and coming down, he made citations of the revolutions and\ntransmutations of the Five Powers (Virtues), arranging them until each\nfound its proper place and was confirmed (by history). (Shi ji\nch 76, slightly modified from Needham 1956b, 232\u201333).\n\n\n\nOn this account, Zou Yan's interests included both the\n\u201cclassical\u201d learning of the Masters traditions and direct\ninquiry into natural phenomena, large and small. While this account\ngives no indication of specific direct contact between Zou and Masters\ntextualists, it does suggest that the Jixia Academy patronized a range\nof thinkers who included what we would today call both philosophers and\npractitioners of the early sciences.\n\n\nThe Han shu describes Zou Yan as a \u201cRecipe\nMaster\u201d or fang shi \u65b9\u58eb. This term was\napplied to a wide range of practitioners of medical, mantic and\ntechnical arts. (The titles of their mostly lost works are listed\nin the shu shu and fang ji sections of the Han\nshu Bibliographic Treatise, discussed above.) Fang\nshi practiced divination and claimed to possess secret texts and\nformulae. They gained great influence during the earlier part of the\nHan dynasty, though their influence waned by the later Han (Kalinowski\n2010; Ngo 1976). They used yin-yang and Five Agents cosmology, and seem\nto have originated from the Shandong peninsula. They were particularly\nassociated with the mantic arts, including the use of the sexagenary\ncycle of stems and branches, the Yi jing, and divination by\nstars, dreams, physiognomy, the winds, and by the use of pitch pipes\n(Li Ling 1993, 2000). The fang shi became an important\nforce in the Han court during the reign of Han Wu Di (r. 141\u201329 BCE),\nbut their origins are probably much older. Practices\nattributed to them have clear antecedents in Warring States\nphilosophical texts such as the Zhuangzi and the \u201cInner\nCultivation\u201d (Nei ye) chapter of the\nGuanzi.\n\n\nReferences to their presence in the court of Qin Shi\nHuang\u79e6\u59cb\u7687 (259\u2013210 BCE), who ruled Qin from\n246 to 221. They remained influential to the early part of the Six\nDynasties (to the fourth century CE). Most came from outlying\nregions, and gained influence for their skills in medicine,\nastronomical prediction and omen interpretation, all of which were\nlinked to the growth of science in early China. They used\nmagico-medical practices on behalf of the health and vitality of the\nemperor, but also introduced standardized measurement of time, space,\nweight, and musical pitch.\n\n\nAn important source for our knowledge of their interests and expertise\nis the collected biographies of fang shi are recorded in\nthe Standard History of the Later Han (Hou Han shu)\nunder the heading \u201cFang Techniques\u201d (fang shu\n\u65b9\u8853). The preface lists their expertise and interests as:\nfate calculation and prognostication, including astrology and the\nprediction of eclipses), medicine and a variety of magical\npractices. Over half of the fifty-seven specialists listed in the\ncollected biography (twenty-nine) practiced some form of astrology\n(biographies 1, 11, 12,16, 18\u201320, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30\u201333,\n35, 38\u201341, 43\u201346, 49, 51\u201353 and 55, as listed in\nKalinowski 2010, 359\u201366).  But they were also credited with\nexpertise in classical texts and in Huang-Lao and Daoist\nlore. (Hou Han shu 82A and 82B. Most of these techniques date\nfrom the late Zhou. See Li Ling 1995 and Kalinowski 2010, especially\nAppendix 2.)\n\n\nIn summary, although Masters textualists and fang shi had\nsome areas of overlapping expertise and interest, their practices and\ntextual lineages diverged in very different directions.\n7. The Early Science(s)\n\n\nI conclude with a brief account of areas of relation between Chinese\nphilosophy and the Chinese sciences, remembering that Chinese accounts\nfocused on specific sciences, rather than on one unified notion of\nscience. We find these primarily in the qualitative sciences of \nastronomy and astrology and medicine.\n\nAn important area of overlap between philosophy and science occurred\nin cosmology, mathematics and calendrics. An important aspect of\ncosmological interest is observational astronomy or astrology (tian\nwen). In an important recent study of Chinese\narchaeo-astronomy, David Pankenier (2013, 5) traces the Chinese\ncoordination of human activities with the observation and positions of\nthe sun, moon, and stars as far back as the Neolithic cultures of the\nfifth millennium BCE. Written evidence of royal interest in stars\nand winds clearly dates back to the Shang oracle bone inscriptions. As\nNathan Sivin (1990, 181) puts it: \u201cThe difference between\nastronomy and astrology was a contrast of emphasis on the quantitative\nas opposed to the qualitative and on objective motions as opposed to\nthe correlation between celestial and political events.\u201d\n\nThese areas have only slight links to philosophy. Astronomical\nand astrological observation was an important part of court ritual,\nsince they were used to determine auspicious times for a wide variety\nof events. It could be said that textualists approved of them as\nan aspect of the conduct of ritual, but there was little philosophical\nengagement with their details. (There are also slight but\nimportant connections between philosophy and mathematics. This question\nhas been in many ways obscured by focus on the idea of mathematical or\nlogical proof and its presence or absence in China (Chemla 2012, Chemla\nand Guo 2004).\n\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, questions about the nature of the heavens\nwere pursued by the fang shi (discussed in section 2). Fang\nexpertise also included divination by the heavens, both by the stars,\nand by interpreting sub-celestial phenomena, including weather, clouds,\nmists, and winds (Ngo 1976, Li Ling 1993).\n\n\nThese activities were not invented by the fang shi. The\nHan shu Bibliographic Treatise also provides evidence of\nfang activity through the titles of lost books. Other evidence\ncomes from late Warring States and Han texts such as the L\u00fc\nShi chunqiu and Huainanzi. The Huainanzi\ncontains several chapters of astronomical interest (Major 1993). One\npassage describes the technical interests of the sage emperor Yu, who\nordered his officials to measure the distances to the ends of the earth\nby pacing the distance to the eastern, western, northern and southern\nextremities of the earth (Huainanzi 4, 56). The exact\nnumbers given are problematic to say the least, but the point is that\nthe sage rulers of antiquity, in legendary accounts, interested\nthemselves in the physical observation of the earth.\n\n\nThe third chapter of the Huainanzi ends with a section on\nthe use of the measurements cast by shadows (gnomons) to calculate\ndistances. This passage is probably a later addition, but for our\npurposes, its inclusion in the Huainanzi is indicative of the\nscientific concerns of the text. It gives directions for a series of\nmeasurements, including how to determine the directions of sunrise,\nsunset, and the cardinal directions. It also explains how to measure\nthe \u201cbreadth and length of east, west, north, and\nsouth\u201d:\n\nIf you wish to know the figures for the breadth and length of east,\nwest, north, and south set up four gnomons to make a right-angled\nfigure one li square. More than ten days before the spring or autumn\nequinox sight along the northern gnomons of the square on the sun from\nits first appearance to its rise above the horizon. Wait for [the day\nwhen] they coincide. When they coincide they are in line with the sun.\nEach time take a sight on it [the sun] with the southern gnomons, and\ntake the amount by which it is within the forward gnomons as the\ndivisor. Divide the whole width and divide the length [between] the\nstanding gnomons in order to know the measurements east and west from\nhere (Huainanzi 3, 53\u201354, translation after Cullen 1976,\n116).\n\nAnother area of potential Ru interest in astronomy is calendrics,\nbased on detailed observation of seasonal changes. One example is the\nMonthly Ordinance (Yueling \u6708\u4ee4) calendars of the\nHuainanzi. Monthly Ordinances use Five Agents correlations to\nspecify the correct social, ritual, and agricultural activities for\neach season. Rulers could use these texts to regulate state ritual\nactivities over the course of the year. The ordinances cover such\ntopics as state activities (fortification, planting, etc.) and the\nconsequences of performing activities at incorrect times. These are the\nfirst texts in the received tradition to link the twenty-eight Lunar\nLodges to the months of the year, associating each month with a lodge,\nwhich indicates the position of the sun among the stars for that month.\n(Ancient Chinese astronomers divided the celestial equator around the\npole star into twenty-eight \u201clodges\u201d (xiu\n\u5bbf), each named by a star within it and each comprising some 13\ndegrees (du \u5ea6) of the circle.) The calendric tables\nlist the days of the year in stem-branch sexagenary order, with\nannotations on the nature of different kinds of days, and which days\nwere auspicious or inauspicious for particular activities. (Such\ncalendars also appear in almost identical form in the Guanzi\nand L\u00fc Shi chunqiu, and were incorporated into\nthe Li ji in the Later Han dynasty. See Guanzi, chs.\n3.8 and 3.9, Rickett 1985, 148\u2013192) They also included monthly and\nseasonal correlates. For example, the lodges were associated with the\nposition of the sun, and dusk and dawn correlated to the five\npentatonic tones, pitch pipe notes, numbers, tastes, smells, color of\nthe emperor\u2019s clothing, presiding deity, and yin and yang\nsacrificial organs, all described in terms of the Five Agents (Major\n1993, 220\u2013225).\n\n\nIt is almost impossible to separate Chinese ideas of body, state,\ncosmos and \u201cnature.\u201d Nathan Sivin (1995, 3n1) points out\nthat there is no indigenous term for \u201cnature\u201d in China\nbefore the nineteenth century. Over the course of the last three\ncenturies BCE, Chinese understandings of the physical world developed\nto reflect, and mirror, political consolidation (Sivin 1995). These new\nideas of cosmic order\u2014correspondence between microcosm (the body)\nand macrocosm (the cosmos)\u2014appeared in new representations of the\nbody, the state, and the cosmos that were based on systematic\napplications and correlations of the ideas of yin and yang and of the\nFive Agents (wuxing). They appear in medical texts such as the\nHuang Di neijing, in calendrics, in observational astronomy\nand the study of astronomical portents with political implications, and\nin the \u201ccorrelative cosmologies\u201d of many Han dynasty texts\n(Lloyd 1996, Lloyd and Sivin 2002).\n\n\nAnother important area of engagement between philosophy and medicine\nwas in the theory and practice of \u201cnurturing life\u201d\n(yang sheng \u990a\u751f). Fang shi medical\npractices and ideas included \u201crecipes\u201d for \u201cNurturing\nLife.\u201d This broad category included a wide range of\nself-cultivation techniques.\n\nReferences to yang sheng techniques appear in both accounts\nof self-cultivation in Masters texts and in the titles of (lost)\nrecipes in the Han shu Bibliographic Treatise. Mark\nCsikzentmihalyi has argued that \u201cmaterial virtue\u201d\ntraditions drawing on yang sheng techniques appear prominently\nin the Mencius and in two versions of the Wu xing\n\u4e94\u884c or \u201cFive Kinds of Action\u201d recovered from\nGuodian and Mawangdui. These texts provide \u201ca detailed moral\npsychology describing the process of the cultivation of the\nvirtues\u201d (Csikszentmihalyi 2004, 7). Mencius (2A2) famously\nrefers to \u201ccultivating flood-like qi\u201d and the third chapter\nof the Zhuangzi is titled \u201cThe Lord of Nurturing\nLife\u201d (Yang sheng zhu). By contrast, references to\nyang sheng in popular culture and in the recipes in the\n\u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d section of the Treatise seem directly\nconcerned with health and longevity (V. Lo 2001 and 2005, Raphals\n2008\u20132009).\n\nYin-yang, qi and the Five Agents also informed\nmedical theories, which were systematized in a cosmological framework\nin the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine or Huang\nDi neijing (Veith 1972, Unschuld and Tessenow 2011). This complex\nand multi-layered text, probably compiled in the first century BCE,\npresents a systematic cosmology that analogizes the body, the state,\nand the cosmos in complex systems of \u201ccorrelative\ncosmology\u201d (Graham 1986; Sivin 1995; Lloyd and Sivin 2002). For\nexample, the Huang Di neijing describes correspondence between\nthe articulations of the body and the cosmos, specifically between\nheaven and earth and the upper and lower parts of the body, including\nrelations and analogies between body, state and the cosmos, all\nexpressed in terms of yin-yang and the Five Agents (Huang Di\nneijing lingshu, 71.2, 446). Such correlations seem a far\ncry from either cosmological speculation or empirical science in any\nmodern sense. Between those extremes stand the mostly lost arts of\ntechnical traditions described in the Han shu Bibliographic\nTreatise: astronomy, medical, pharmacological, and mantic arts, whose\npractitioners were the counterparts and potential competitors of the\nMasters textualists or philosophers (Lloyd and Sivin 2002). Expertise\ninitially developed by diviners and technical specialists became part\nof the Daode jing, Zhuangzi, and Huainanzi.\nIt was also incorporated into the systematic cosmology and medicine of\nthe Han (Lloyd 1996, Lloyd and Sivin 2002). The Huang Di\nneijing is listed (and first appears) in the Recipes and Methods\nsection of the Han shu Bibliographic Treatise under the\nheading of Medical Classics (Han shu 30, 1776).\n\n\nA particular problem raised by the application of yin-yang theory to\nmedicine was the implications of yin-yang theories for accounts of\ngender (Furth 1986, Raphals 1998, Yates 2005), including the problem of\nthe androgyny of what Charlotte Furth calls \u201cthe Yellow\nEmperor\u2019s body.\u201d Furth argues that the human body is\nunderstood as androgynous before the development of gynecology in the\nSong dynasty. These models of the body inform the early history of\nyin-yang theory, and the gender analogies that form part of\nthat discourse. A central text to these analogies is the\nHuang Di neijing, which is striking for its overall\nandrogyny. Overall, women are not specified as medically distinct\nfrom men, and where they do occur, discussions of sexual difference are\nusually linked to specific questions of fertility and reproduction\n(e.g., Huang Di neijing suwen 1.3.8 and 7.2.26).\n\n\nOf more interest for a consideration of science and philosophy are a\ngroup of analogies in medical and philosophical texts between yin and\nyang and male and female. They describe the conditions of men and women\nby analogy with yin and yang, heaven and earth, and\nsometimes right and left. For example, the statement that women and men\nhave opposite pulse patterns: \u201cIn women the right [pulse]\nmanifests opposition, the left manifests obedience; in men the left\n[pulse] manifests opposition, the right manifests obedience\u201d\n(Huang Di neijing suwen, 15.2.45).\n\n\nTheories of yin-yang, qi and Five Agents were applied to the\ndiagnosis and treatment of disease, using techniques such as acumoxa\nand herbal medicine. These theories were also applied to\nlongevity practices designed to extend health and life and in some\ncases to produce literal, physical immortality.\n\n\nAnother very important area of overlap between philosophy and\nmedicine is the significant number of important explicitly Daoist\nthinkers who were also practicing physicians and authors of important\nmedical texts. (For more information on all these topics, see the\nentry \u201cChinese Medicine and Chinese Philosophy\u201d.)\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, this brief account addresses important issues in the\ncomplex relations between philosophy and the early history of science\nin China, especially as they informed the qualitative sciences of\nmedicine and astronomy, and their relations with early Chinese\nphilosophy overall. It shows that the harsh assessment of Chinese\nphilosophy quoted at the beginning of this essay over-simplifies\nseveral complex questions. The work of Joseph Needham, Nathan Sivin and\nothers demonstrates that Chinese philosophy is not inherently\n\u201canti-science.\u201d But it could be argued \u2013 and\npersuasively in the view of this author \u2013 that the priorities\nassociated with the vexed term \u201cConfucianism\u201d have often\n(though not always) steered Chinese philosophy away from scientific\nconcerns. A second question raised here is whether Chinese philosophy\ncontributes to science in ways that constitute a culturally specific\n\u201cChinese science\u201d that is different from modern science.\nThis point remains a locus of strong disagreement among historians of\nscience in China.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Bodde, D., 1991, <em>Chinese Thought, Science, and Society: The\nIntellectual and Social Background of Science and Technology\nin Pre-Modern China</em>, Honolulu: University of Hawai\u2018i Press.", "Bruya, B., et al., 2010, <em>Effortless Attention: A New\nPerspective in the Cognitive Science of Attention and Action</em>,\nCambridge, MA: MIT Press.", "Chemla, K.
