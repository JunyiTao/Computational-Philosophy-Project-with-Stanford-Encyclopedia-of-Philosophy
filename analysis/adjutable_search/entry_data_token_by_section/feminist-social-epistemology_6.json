    "main_text": "Social Models of Knowledge and Objectivity || Strong Objectivity\n3.1 Strong Objectivity\n\n\nStandpoint theorists, and many who are inspired by standpoint theory,\nnot only maintain Haraway\u2019s situated knowledge thesis,\nconceptualizing all knowledge as perspectival, but also hold a\nstronger thesis that some of those perspectives are epistemically more\nvaluable than others. In other words, some perspectives lead to\nobjectivity in a way that others do not. While the privileging of some\nepistemic perspectives ensures that standpoint theory bears normative\ncontent, it remains to be explained how one attains a privileged\nepistemic standpoint that will lead to objective knowledge, and how\none can identify such a standpoint.\n\n\nAlthough a few standpoint theorists argue for a women\u2019s standpoint\nstemming directly from women\u2019s experience, most influential standpoint\ntheorists including Hartsock (1983) and Harding (1986) insist that the\nMarxist-inspired arguments imply that although the feminist standpoint\nis deeply connected to the lives of women, the epistemically\nprivileged nature of the feminist standpoint stems from active\npolitical engagement in the feminist cause, and does not just\nrepresent the perspective of women. Thus, a certain kind of political\nactivity is required in order to appreciate the situation of women or\nother oppressed groups. This sense of standpoint goes beyond the idea\nof perspective, and refers to the capacity to develop \u201ca\ncritical consciousness about the nature of our social location and the\ndifference it makes epistemically\u201d. The idea of a standpoint\nbuilds upon, but is distinctive from the situated knowledge thesis\nthat recognizes the importance of social location in shaping epistemic\nperspective (Wylie 2003, 31). A standpoint does not naturally or\nautomatically arise from a particular social location, although the\nexperiences of an oppressed social location can make the achievement\nof a standpoint more likely.\n\n\nHarding has developed this idea further in her call for researchers to\nstart their research from the lives of women and, more generally, the\nlives of marginalized groups, regardless of their own social location\n(Harding 1991). This line of reasoning weakens the connection between\nsocial or material location and epistemic perspective, since\npresumably a researcher can access a privileged epistemic perspective\nwithout occupying the relevant social location through the appropriate\ncritical work. Yet it maintains the situated knowledge thesis that\nperspectives are differentiated according to social location, and it\ncalls on researchers to engage in reflexive analysis of how their own\nsocial location shapes their research. Harding argues that such\nreflexive analysis, coupled with an active attempt to engage in\nresearch from the perspectives of the oppressed will result in a\nstronger form of objectivity than the \u201cweak objectivity\u201d\navailable through a neutral approach to knowing that ignores the role\nof social location and cultural assumptions in shaping one\u2019s\nperspective.  Harding\u2019s strong objectivity results from an\nacknowledgment of the perspectival nature of all knowing, and a\ndetermined effort to examine the world from the positions of the\nsocially underprivileged rather than the privileged. The result,\naccording to standpoint theorists such as Harding, will be knowledge\nthat is less partial and distorted, and hence, more objective.\n",
