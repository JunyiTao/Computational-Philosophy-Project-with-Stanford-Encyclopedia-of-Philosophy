    "main_text": "Issues || Empiricism, Verificationism, and Anti-metaphysics\n4.1 Empiricism, Verificationism, and Anti-metaphysics\n\nSince antiquity the idea that natural science rests importantly on\nexperience has been non-controversial. The only real questions about\nthe sources of scientific knowledge are: Are there parts of science\nthat do not rest on experience or rest also on something other than\nexperience? If so what account can we give of those parts? And to the\nextent that science does rest on experience how can we know that it\ndoes? There is another question about science related to these, though\nnot strictly about the sources of science, and that is: Why, in making\nclaims about the world, should we be scientific as opposed to, say,\nmystical? The difficulty is that any scientific answer to this last\nquestion would reasonably be thought to beg the very question it\npurports to address.\n\nLong before the twentieth century the prevailing opinion was that\nEuclidean geometry, standard mathematics, and logic did not rest on\nexperience in any obvious way. They were largely presupposed in our\nempirical work, and it was difficult to see what if anything might\ndisconfirm them. Geometry was a special case and might be handled in\ndifferent ways that we shall not discuss here. That leaves logic and\nmathematics.\n\nIf Frege and Russell were right, then mathematics could be thought of\nas expressing no more than logical truths and handled in whatever way\nlogic was to be treated. For Frege both mathematics and logic were\nanalytic, but that, even if true, does not provide the needed answers.\nWittgenstein\u2019s no-content theory of logic suggested that all of\nthe real claims, the ones that had genuine content, could be\nappropriately supported by experience, and the logical and hence\nmathematical claims had no content to support. This seemed to open the\nway for a thoroughgoing empiricism in which the logical and\nmathematical fit in with the ordinary claims of physics and biology in\na harmonious way. The next subsection about analyticity discusses the\nquestion of whether the needed distinctions can be drawn.\n\nIn developing his theory of types Russell said in effect that some\nexpressions that seem to be sentences in fact say nothing at all. This\nis because, despite appearances, they are not grammatically well\nformed. Wittgenstein found this suggestive. In the Tractatus\nhe suggested that much else was nonsense as well including traditional\nmetaphysics and supposed claims about the \u201chigher\u201d. When\nin late 1929 Wittgenstein proposed (Waismann 1967/1979), in\nconversations with Schlick and Waismann, a strict verificationism as a\nbasis for identifying the legitimate parts of discourse, this seemed\nto the logical empiricists to be a very attractive tool for setting\naside the unscientific parts of philosophy.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that all logical empiricists or even all\nmembers of the Vienna Circle accepted the strict verificationist view\nthat in order to be meaningful a claim must be implied by a finite\nnumber of observation sentences. Even though those observation\nsentences need not be true, this view had the drawback that so-called\nlaws of nature would not be meaningful on this criterion. Schlick was\nprepared to bite the bullet and hold that laws were not statements at\nall but principles of inference. Others were not prepared to go so far\nand sought more liberal formulations. This more liberal or\n\u201cleft\u201d wing of the Vienna Circle included Carnap, Philipp\nFrank, Hahn, and Neurath. Carnap does not seem to have been a strict\nverificationist even in the Aufbau (1928/1967).\n\nOver the years a great many different formulations of verificationist\nprinciples ensued. Most of them came to a bad end rather quickly, and\nthis is sometimes taken as a convincing argument that any form of\nverificationism is utterly misguided. Perhaps, but we should be\ncautious. There are undoubtedly many different features joined in any\none of the proposals, and even a sequence of failures may not show\nwhere to place the blame. The central idea behind verificationism is\nlinking some sort of meaningfulness with (in principle) confirmation,\nat least for synthetic sentences. The actual formulations embodied not\nonly such a link but various particular accounts of confirmation as\nwell. Now confirmation is a complex matter, and it is unlikely that we\nshall have the final satisfactory account any time soon. This should\nnot persuade us, however, that there are no satisfactory accounts of\nconfirmation any more than our current lack of the final physics\nshould convince us that there are no physical facts of the matter. So\neven a string of failures in formulating verificationist principles\nmay mean no more than that the embedded accounts of confirmation are\ntoo simple but the link between meaningfulness and confirmation is\nnevertheless sound.\n\nEven if we set this caution aside, there may be parts of a\npersistently employed strategy that lead to persistent failure. These\nparts and failures might be avoidable. To see how this may be so we\nwill compare what is perhaps the most famous formulation of the\nverificationist principle, in Ayer 1936, with a later one, in Carnap\n1956. A.J. Ayer had visited the Vienna Circle from late 1932 on into\n1933, returning home for the summer term. While in Vienna he attended\nmeetings of the Circle and overlapped for five weeks with Quine.\nNeither Carnap nor Neurath were there at the time, so the left wing of\nthe Circle was not fully represented. When Ayer returned to England he\npublished Language, Truth, and Logic in 1936. Even\nimmediately it was widely discussed, and after the war sales were\nspectacular. For many in England this book was the epitome of logical\npositivism and remains so.\n\nAyer was careful to restrict his criterion of meaningfulness to\nsynthetic sentences and to demand only in principle confirmation. And\nthe formulation seems very natural: Confirmation is a feature that\napplies to sentences (or groups of them) and not to sub-sentential\nparts, and for an empiricist the content that a synthetic sentence has\nwould be empirical content. So it would seem that to have empirical\ncontent a sentence, A, should either directly imply some\nobservational sentence or add to the observational content of some\nother sentence, B. That is, the conjunction of A and\nB should imply some observational sentence not implied by\nB alone. This formulation may be natural, but it is also\nfatally flawed. It would declare any sentence whatsoever as\nmeaningful: For any sentence A and any observation sentence\nO, A would be meaningful because it could be\nconjoined to A \u2283 O. The latter would not in\ngeneral imply O, but the conjunction would.\n\nOther more elaborate formulations followed along the same lines, and\nother more elaborate counterexamples appeared just as fast. Hempel\nreviewed the situation twice within about a year (Hempel 1950 and\n1951). First he concluded that it was a lively and promising line of\nresearch and later concluded that it was not promising at all. In\nretrospect it may be that the problems arise because we were led by\nthe fact that confirmation is a feature that applies to whole\nsentences into thinking that the level at which to apply the criterion\nwas the level of whole sentences. Now a sentence with meaningless\nparts might well pass some test especially if the test involves its\nbeing combined with other sentences that can have meaningless parts.\nSo one way to avoid this difficulty is to try to find a formulation\nthat applies the test at the level of basic expressions, those that\ncan be thought of as \u201cnot having parts\u201d so to speak.\n\nThis is the strategy that Carnap employed in \u201cThe Methodological\nCharacter of Theoretical Concepts\u201d (1956). Observational terms\nare assumed to have empirical content. Logical terms are assumed to\nhave none. And all defined terms are assumed to be replaced by their\ndefinitions. If for some basic, non-logical term there is a sentence\nthat contains that term as its only non-logical element and if that\nsentence implies some observation sentence, then that sentence has\nempirical content and so does its only non-logical term. If we have\nestablished that each term from some set, K, is empirically\nsignificant we might test still further terms by seeing whether those\nfurther terms can add to what is sayable with terms from K.\nCarnap\u2019s actual definition is quite complicated, but it does\nseem to avoid the difficulties of its predecessors. It also allows an\naccount of why those predecessors ran into trouble, viz., that they\napplied at the level of whole sentences (naturally enough) rather than\nto elementary terms.\n\nNot long after Carnap\u2019s definition was published David Kaplan\ndevised what seemed to be counterexamples. They became fairly well\nknown, but they were not published until 1975. Shortly thereafter it\nwas shown (Creath 1976) that either Carnap\u2019s definition is not\nopen to the counterexamples as presented or it can be patched in a\nvery natural way so that it avoids them. This does not show that there\nare no counterexamples or that there are no other features of the\ndefinition to which one might object. But it does show that the\nsituation is not as dire as Hempel supposed in 1951.\n\nWe need to address another issue in considering verificationism, the\npersistent criticism that it is self-undercutting. The argument for\nthis claim goes like this: The principle claims that every meaningful\nsentence is either analytic or verifiable. Well, the principle itself\nis surely not analytic; we understand the meanings of the words in it\nperfectly well because we understand our own language. And we still do\nnot think it true, so it cannot be true in virtue of meaning. And it\nis not verifiable either (whatever we choose \u2018verifiable\u2019\nto mean).\n\nThis sounds more compelling than it is. Ayer understood the principle\nto be a definition, defining a technical term, \u2018meaning\u2019.\nIf so, then the sentence expressing the principle would indeed be\nanalytic. So the self-undercutting charge strictly fails. But so\nconstrued and with nothing else said about it, the principle would not\nhave the same punch as before. Why should a metaphysician care whether\nhis or her utterances lack some technical feature?\n\nCarnap explicitly takes up the \u201cself-undercutting\u201d charge\nagainst verifiability in Philosophy and Logical Syntax\n(1935), and he is not interested in introducing a new technical term,\n\u2018meaning\u2019, or in denying this new technical property to\nunverifiable sentences. Carnap is careful to distinguish the language\nfor which the verifiability principle is given from the meta-language\nin which we talk about that language. This meta-language would be the\nlanguage in which the principle would be expressed. This may seem to\noffer another strategy against the \u201cself-undercutting\u201d\ncharge because the principle applies to a different language than that\nin which it is expressed. This is not Carnap\u2019s strategy. Carnap\nfully understands that if the general verificationist strategy is\nfollowed, there will also be a verificationist principle expressed in\nthe meta-meta-language governing the meta-language.\n\nCarnap\u2019s real defense of the principle was achieved by changing\nthe nature of the discussion. By 1934 Carnap had introduced an\nimportant new element into his philosophy called the Principle of\nTolerance. Tolerance is a radical idea. There is no uniquely correct\nlogic (1934/1937 xiv\u2013xv). Empiricism is a convention (Carnap,\n1936/1937 33). Perhaps more precisely each of the various versions of\nempiricism (including some sort of verificationism) is best understood\nas a proposal for structuring the language of science. Before\ntolerance, both empiricism and verificationism are announced as if\nthey are simply correct. Correspondingly, what Carnap called\nmetaphysics was then treated as though it were, as a matter of brute\nfact, unintelligible. But what is announced thus dogmatically can be\nrejected equally dogmatically. Once tolerance is in place, alternative\nphilosophic positions, including metaphysical ones, are construed as\nalternative proposals for structuring the language of science. No\ntheoretical argument or evidence can show that one of the proposed\nlanguages is the uniquely correct one. Nor can theoretical arguments\nor evidence show that it is false. Neither proposals nor languages are\nthe sort of thing to be true or false. Instead, proposals call for\npractical decisions and practical arguments rather than for\ntheoretical reasons or evidence. Carnap believes that there are indeed\nvery good practical reasons for adopting the proposal of\nverificationism, for choosing a language of science in which all\nsubstantive (synthetic) claims can, at least in principle, be brought\nbefore the court of public experience. The reason is that if we do not\nrequire this, the result is \u201cwearisome controversies\u201d that\nthere is no hope of resolving. That, he thinks, is the sad history of\nattempts to get beyond science, and it is just too painful.\n\nIf the proposals constituting some version of verificationism are\nadopted, then in the language thus constituted it will be analytically\ntrue that there are no synthetic sentences that are both unverifiable\nand meaningful. The notion of meaning here is not some new technical\ninvention. Rather, \u2018meaning\u2019 is used in something like the\nordinary sense. No grammatically well-formed sentence of this new\nlanguage violates the verifiability principle. And the principle\nitself is completely safe. Thought of in this way the verifiability\nprinciple does not describe natural language; it is not intended to.\nIt is intended to reform language to make it a more useful tool for\nthe purposes of science. Carnap is under no illusion that natural\nlanguages are free from what seem to be metaphysical commitments. Nor\nis he under the illusion that defenders of the sort of metaphysics he\ntargets will readily step up to the challenge of presenting precise\nrules of grammar and inference. There is no weakening of his defense\nof empiricism, but it is put on a somewhat different footing.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that Carnap\u2019s Principle of Tolerance\nintroduces a new conception of philosophy with far-ranging\nimplications beyond those just discussed concerning verification. The\nidea that philosophy is concerned with language and its analysis was\nnot new. What is novel is the idea that what had been seen as\nphilosophical claims were better understood as proposals for\nstructuring the language of science. Since these languages and\nthe concepts they contained were to be thought of as tools, none of\nwhich was uniquely correct, the choice among the alternatives was a\npractical decision about usefulness for certain purposes rather than a\ntheoretical question. Philosophy still has important work to do: It\ncan analyze existing concepts. And since many existing concepts are\nvague, it can also make them more precise in a variety of ways through\nexplication. Philosophy can also investigate wholly new concepts. In\nall this, philosophy explores the consequences of structuring the\nlanguage of science in this way or that. It becomes, thus, a kind of\nconceptual engineering. Conceptual analysis, explication,\nconstruction, and engineering continue to be fruitful ideas in\nphilosophy, though it is not always understood how much of this was\ninitiated or shaped by Carnap and other logical empiricists.\n",
