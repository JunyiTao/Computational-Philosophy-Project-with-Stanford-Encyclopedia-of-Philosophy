Dreams and epistemology\n1.1 Cartesian dream skepticism\n\nDream skepticism has traditionally been the most famous and widely\ndiscussed philosophical problem raised by dreaming (see Williams 1978;\nStroud 1984). In the Meditations, Descartes uses dreams to\nmotivate skepticism about sensory-based beliefs about the external\nworld and his own bodily existence. He notes that sensory experience\ncan also lead us astray in commonplace sensory illusions such as\nseeing things as too big or small. But he does not think such cases\njustify general doubts about the reliability of sensory perception: by\ntaking a closer look at an object seen under suboptimal conditions, we\ncan easily avoid deception. By contrast, dreams suggest that even in a\nseemingly best-case scenario of sensory perception (Stroud 1984),\ndeception is possible. Even the realistic experience of sitting\ndressed by the fire and looking at a piece of paper in one\u2019s hands\n(Descartes 1641: I.5) is something that can, and according to\nDescartes often does, occur in a dream.\n\nThere are different ways of construing the dream argument. A strong\nreading is that Descartes is trapped in a lifelong dream and none of\nhis experiences have ever been caused by external objects (the\nAlways Dreaming Doubt; see Newman 2019). A weaker reading is\nthat he is just sometimes dreaming but cannot rule out at any given\nmoment that he is dreaming right now (the Now Dreaming Doubt;\nsee Newman 2019). This is still epistemologically worrisome: even\nthough some of his sensory-based beliefs might be true, he cannot\ndetermine which these are unless he can rule out that he is dreaming.\nDoubt is thus cast on all of his beliefs, making sensory-based\nknowledge slip out of reach.\n\nCartesian-style skeptical arguments have the following form (quoted\nfrom Klein 2015):\n\nIf I know that p, then there are no genuine grounds for\ndoubting that p.\nU is a genuine ground for doubting that p.\nTherefore, I do not know that p.\n\n\nIf we apply this to the case of dreaming, we get:\n\nIf I know that I am sitting dressed by the fire, then there are no\ngenuine grounds for doubting that I am really sitting dressed by the\nfire.\nIf I were now dreaming, this would be a genuine ground for\ndoubting that I am sitting dressed by the fire: in dreams, I have\noften had the realistic experience of sitting dressed by the fire when\nI was actually lying undressed in bed!\nTherefore, I do not know that I am now sitting dressed by the\nfire.\n\n\nImportantly, both strong and weak versions of the dream argument cast\ndoubt only on sensory-based beliefs, but leave other beliefs\nunscathed. According to Descartes, that 2+3=5 or that a square has no\nmore than 4 sides is knowable even if he is now dreaming:\n\n\nalthough, in truth, I should be dreaming, the rule still holds that\nall which is clearly presented to my intellect is indisputably true.\n(Descartes 1641: V.15) \n\n\nBy Descartes\u2019 lights, dreams do not undermine our ability to engage in\nthe project of pure, rational enquiry (Frankfurt 1970; but see\nBroughton 2002).\n1.2 Earlier discussions of dream skepticism and why Descartes\u2019 version is special\n\nDream arguments have been a staple of philosophical skepticism since\nantiquity and were so well known that in his objections to the\nMeditations, Hobbes (1641) criticized Descartes for not\nhaving come up with a more original argument. Yet, Descartes\u2019\nversion of the problem, more than any other, has left its mark on the\nphilosophical discussion.\n\nEarlier versions tended to touch upon dreams just briefly and discuss\nthem alongside other examples of sensory deception. For example, in\nthe Theaetetus (157e), Plato has Socrates discuss a defect in\nperception that is common to\n\n\ndreams and diseases, including insanity, and everything else that is\nsaid to cause illusions of sight and hearing and the other senses.\n\n\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that knowledge cannot be defined through\nperception. \n\nDreams also appear in the canon of standard skeptical arguments used\nby the Pyrrhonists. Again, dreams and sleep are just one of several\nconditions (including illness, joy, and sorrow) that cast doubt on the\ntrusthworthiness of sensory perception (Diogenes Laertius, Lives\nof Eminent Philosophers; Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of\nPyrrhonism).\n\nAugustine (Against the Academics; Confessions)\nthought the dream problem could be contained, arguing that in\nretrospect, we can distinguish both dreams and illusions from actual\nperception (Matthew 2005: chapter 8). And Montaigne (The Apology\nfor Raymond Sebond) noted that wakefulness itself teems with\nreveries and illusions, which he thought were even more\nepistemologically worrisome than nocturnal dreams.\n\nDescartes devoted much more space to the discussion of dreaming and\ncast it as a unique epistemological threat distinct from both waking\nillusions and evil genius or brain-in-a-vat-style arguments. His claim\nthat he has often been deceived by his dreams implies he also saw\ndreaming as a real-world (rather than merely hypothetical) threat.\n\n\nThis is further highlighted by the intimate, first-person style of the\n Meditations. Their narrator is supposed to exemplify\neveryone\u2019s epistemic situation, illustrating the typical defects of\nthe human mind. Readers are further drawn in by Descartes\u2019 strategy of\nmoving from commonsense examples towards more sophisticated\nphilosophical claims (Frankfurt 1970). For example, Descartes builds\nup towards dream skepticism by first considering familiar cases of\nsensory illusions and then deceptively realistic dreams.\n\nFinally, much attention has been devoted to several dreams Descartes\nreportedly had as a young man. Some believe these dreams embodied\ntheoretical doubts he developed in the Discourse and\nMeditations (Baillet 1691; Leibniz 1880: IV; Cole 1992;\nKeefer 1996). Hacking (2001:252) suggests that for Descartes, dream\nskepticism was not just a philosophical conundrum but a source of\ngenuine doubt. There is also some discussion about the dream reports\u2019\nauthenticity (Freud 1940; Cole 1992; Clarke 2006; Browne 1977).\n1.3 Dreaming and other skeptical scenarios\n\nIn the Meditations, after discussing the dream argument,\nDescartes raises the possibility of an omnipotent evil genius\ndetermined to deceive us even in our most basic beliefs. Contrary to\ndream deception, Descartes emphasizes that the evil genius\nhypothesis is a mere fiction. Still, it radicalizes the dream\ndoubt in two respects. One, where the dream argument left the\nknowability of certain general truths intact, these are cast in doubt\nby the evil genius hypothesis. Two, where the dream argument,\nat least on the weaker reading, involves just temporary deception, the\nevil genius has us permanently deceived.\n\nOne modernized version, the brain-in-a-vat thought\nexperiment, says that if evil scientists placed your brain in a vat\nand stimulated it just right, your conscious experience would be\nexactly the same as if you were still an ordinary, embodied human\nbeing (Putnam 1981). In the Matrix-trilogy (Chalmers 2005),\nMatrixers live unbeknownst to themselves in a computer simulation.\nUnlike the brain-in-a-vat, they have bodies that are kept\nalive in pods, and flaws in the simulation allow some of them to bend\nits rules to their advantage.\n\nUnlike dream deception, which is often cast as a regularly recurring\nactuality (cf. Windt 2011), brain-in-a-vat-style arguments are often\nthought to be merely logically or nomologically possible. However,\nthere might be good reasons for thinking that we actually live in a\ncomputer simulation (Bostrom 2003), and if we lend some credence to\nradical skeptical scenarios, this may have consequences for how we act\n(Schwitzgebel 2017).\n\nEven purely hypothetical skeptical scenarios may enhance their\npsychological force by capitalizing on the analogy with dreams. Clark\n(2005) argues that the Matrix contains elements of\n\u201cindustrial-strength deception\u201d in which both sensory\nexperience and intellectual functioning are exactly the same as in\nstandard wake-states, whereas other aspects are more similar to the\ncompromised reasoning and bizarre shifts that are the hallmark of\ndreams.\n1.4 Descartes\u2019 solution to the dream problem and real-world dreams\n\nAt the end of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes suggests a\nsolution to the dream problem that is tied to a reassessment of what\nit is like to dream. Contrary to his remarks in the First\nMeditation, he notes that dreams are only rarely connected to\nwaking memories and are often discontinuous, as when dream characters\nsuddenly appear or disappear. He then introduces the coherence\ntest:\n\n\nBut when I perceive objects with regard to which I can distinctly\ndetermine both the place whence they come, and that in which they are,\nand the time at which they appear to me, and when, without\ninterruption, I can connect the perception I have of them with the\nwhole of the other parts of my life, I am perfectly sure that what I\nthus perceive occurs while I am awake and not during sleep.\n(Meditation VI. 24) \n\n\nFor all practical purposes, he has now found a mark by which dreaming\nand waking can be distinguished (cf. Meditation I.7), and\neven if the coherence test is not fail-safe, the threat of dream\ndeception has been averted.\n\nDescartes\u2019 remarks about the discontinuous and ad hoc nature of many\ndreams are backed up by empirical work on dream bizarreness (see\nHobson 1988; Revonsuo & Salmivalli 1995). Still, many of his\ncritics were not convinced this helped his case against the skeptic.\nEven if Descartes\u2019 revised phenomenological description characterizes\nmost dreams, one might occasionally merely dream of successfully\nperforming the test (Hobbes 1641), and in some dreams, one might seem\nto have a clear and distinct idea but this impression is false\n(Bourdin 1641). Both the coherence test and the criterion of clarity\nand distinctness would then be unreliable.\n\nHow considerations of empirical plausibility impact the dream argument\ncontinues to be a matter of debate. Grundmann (2002) appeals to\nscientific dream research to introduce an introspective criterion:\nwhen we introspectively notice that we are able to engage in critical\nreflection, we have good reason to think that we are awake and not\ndreaming. However, this assumes critical reasoning to be uniformly\nabsent in dreams. If attempts at critical reasoning do occur in dreams\nand if they generally tend to be corrupted, the introspective\ncriterion might again be problematic (Windt 2011, 2015a). There are\nalso cases in which even after awakening, people mistake what was in\nfact a dream for reality (Wamsley et al. 2014). At least in certain\nsituations and for some people, dream deception might be a genuine\ncause of concern (Windt 2015a).\n2. The ontology of dreams\n\nIn what follows, the term \u201cconscious experience\u201d is used\nas an umbrella term for the occurrence of sensations, thoughts,\nimpressions, emotions etc. in dreams (cf. Dennett 1976). These are all\nphenomenal states: there is something it is like to be in\nthese states for the subject of experience (cf. Nagel 1974). To ask\nabout dream experience is to ask whether it is like something\nto dream while dreaming, and whether what it is like\nis similar to (or relevantly different from) corresponding waking\nexperiences.\n2.1 Are dreams experiences?\n\nCartesian dream skepticism depends on a seemingly innocent background\nassumption: that dreams are conscious experiences. If this is\nfalse, then dreams are not deceptive experiences during sleep and we\ncannot be deceived, while dreaming, about anything at all. Whether\ndreams are experiences is a major question for the ontology of dreams\nand closely bound up with dream skepticism.\n\nThe most famous argument denying that dreams are experiences was\nformulated by Norman Malcolm (1956, 1959). Today, his position is\ncommonly rejected as implausible. Still, it set the tone for the\nanalysis of dreaming as a target phenomenon for philosophy of\nmind.\n\nFor Malcolm, the denial of dream experience followed from the\nconceptual analysis of sleep: \u201cif a person is in any\nstate of consciousness it logically follows that he is not sound\nasleep\u201d (Malcolm 1956: 21). Following some remarks of\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1953: 184; see Chihara 1965 for discussion),\nMalcolm claimed\n\n\nthe concept of dreaming is derived, not from dreaming, but from\ndescriptions of dreams, i.e., from the familiar phenomenon that we\ncall \u201ctelling a dream\u201d. (Malcolm 1959:55)\n\n\nMalcolm argued that retrospective dream reports are the sole criterion\nfor determining whether a dream occurred and there is no independent\nway of verifying dream reports. While first-person, past-tense\npsychological statements (such as \u201cI felt afraid\u201d) can at\nleast in principle be verified by independent observations (but see\nCanfield 1961; Siegler 1967; Schr\u00f6der 1997), he argued dream\nreports (such as \u201cin my dream, I felt afraid\u201d) are\ngoverned by different grammars and merely superficially resemble\nwaking reports. In particular, he denied dream reports imply the\noccurrence of experiences (such as thoughts, feelings, or judgements)\nin sleep:\n\n\nIf a man had certain thoughts and feelings in a dream it no more\nfollows that he had those thoughts and feelings while asleep, than it\nfollows from his having climbed a mountain in a dream that he climbed\na mountain while asleep. (Malcolm 1959/1962: 51\u201352) \n\n\nWhat exactly Malcolm means by \u201cconscious experience\u201d is\nunclear. Sometimes he seems to be saying that conscious experience is\nconceptually tied to wakefulness (Malcolm 1956); other times he claims\nthat terms such as mental activity or conscious experience are vague\nand it is senseless to apply them to sleep and dreams (Malcolm 1959:\n52).\n\nMalcolm\u2019s analysis of dreaming has been criticized as assuming\nan overly strict form of verificationism and a na\u00efve view of\nlanguage and conceptual change. A particularly counterintuitive\nconsequence of his view is that there can be no observational evidence\nfor the occurrence of dreams in sleep aside from dream reports. This\nincludes behavioral evidence such as sleepwalking or sleeptalking,\nwhich he thought showed the person was partially awake; as he also\nthought dreams occur in sound sleep, such sleep behaviors were largely\nirrelevant to the investigation of dreaming proper. He also claimed\nadopting a physiological criterion of dreaming (such as EEG measures\nof brain activity during sleep) would change the concept of dreaming,\nwhich he argued was tied exclusively to dream reporting. This claim\nwas particularly radical as it explicitly targeted the discovery of\nREM sleep and its association with dreaming (Dement & Kleitman\n1957), which is commonly regarded as the beginning of the science of\nsleep and dreaming. Malcolm\u2019s position was that the very project of a\nscience of dreaming was misguided.\n\nContra Malcolm, most assume that justification does not depend on\nstrict criteria with the help of which the truth of a statement can be\ndetermined with absolute certainty, but \u201con appeals to the\nsimplicity, plausibility, and predictive adequacy of an explanatory\nsystem as a whole\u201d (Chihara & Fodor 1965: 197). In this\nview, behavioral and/or physiological evidence can be used to verify\ndream reports (Ayer 1960) and the alleged principled difference\nbetween dream reports and other first-person, past-tense psychological\nsentences (Siegler 1967; Schr\u00f6der 1997) disappears.\n\nPutnam noted that Malcolm\u2019s analysis of the concept of dreaming\nrelies on the dubious idea that philosophers have access to deep\nconceptual truths that are hidden to laypeople:\n\n\nthe lexicographer would undoubtedly perceive the logical (or\nsemantical) connection between being a pediatrician and being a\ndoctor, but he would miss the allegedly \u201clogical\u201d\ncharacter of the connection between dreams and waking impressions.\n[\u2026] this \u201cdepth grammar\u201d kind of analyticity (or\n\u201clogical dependence\u201d) does not exist. (Putnam 1962 [1986]:\n306) \n\n\nNagel argued that even if one accepts Malcolm\u2019s analysis of the\nconcept of dreaming,\n\n\nit is a mistake to invest the demonstration that it is impossible to\nhave experiences while asleep with more import than it has. It is an\nobservation about our use of the word \u201cexperience\u201d, and no\nmore. It does not imply that nothing goes on in our minds while we\ndream. (Nagel 1959: 114) \n\n\nWhether dream thoughts, feelings or beliefs should count as real\ninstances of their kind now becomes an open question, and in any case\nthere is no conceptual contradiction involved in saying one has\nexperiences while asleep and dreaming.\n2.2 Dreams as instantaneous memory insertions\n\nTo ask about dream experience is also to ask whether there is\nsomething it is like to dream during sleep as opposed to there just\nbeing something it is like to remember dreaming after awakening.\nDennett\u2019s (1976, 1979) cassette theory says dreams are\nthe product of instantaneous memory insertion at the moment of the\nawakening, as if a cassette with pre-scripted dreams had been inserted\ninto memory, ready for replay. Dennett claims the cassette theory and\nthe view that dreams are experiences can deal equally well with\nempirical evidence for instance on the relationship between dreaming\nand REM sleep. The cassette theory is preferable because it is more\nparsimonious, positing only an unconscious dream composition process\nrather than an additional conscious presentation process in sleep. For\nDennett, the important point is that it is impossible to distinguish\nbetween the two rival theories based on dream recall; the question of\ndream experience should be settled by independent empirical\nevidence.\n\nWhile Dennett shares Malcolm\u2019s skepticism about dream experience, this\nlatter claim is diametrically opposed to Malcolm\u2019s rejection of\na science of dreaming. For Dennett, the unreliability of dream recall\nalso is not unique, but exemplifies a broader problem with memory\nreports: we generally cannot use retrospective recall to distinguish\nconscious experience from memory insertion (Dennett 1991; see also\nEmmett 1978).\n\nAn earlier and much discussed (Binz 1878; Goblot 1896; Freud 1899;\nHall 1981; Kramer 2007:22\u201324) version of Dennett\u2019s\ncassette theory goes back to Maury\u2019s (1861) description of a long and\ncomplex dream about the French revolution that culminated in his\nexecution at the guillotine, at which point Maury suddenly awoke to\nfind that the headboard had fallen on his neck. Because the dream\nseemed to systematically build up to this dramatic conclusion, which\nin turn coincided with a sudden external event, he suggested that such\ncases were best explained as instantaneous memory insertions\nexperienced at the moment of awakening. Similarly, Gregory (1916)\ndescribed dreams are psychical explosions occurring at the moment of\nawakening.\n\nThe trustworthiness of dream reports continues to be contentious.\nRosen (2013) argues that dream reports are often fabricated and fail\nto accurately describe experiences occurring during sleep. By\ncontrast, Windt (2013, 2015a) argues that dream reports can at least\nunder certain conditions (such as in laboratory studies, when dreams\nare reported immediately after awakening by trained participants) be\nregarded as trustworthy sources of evidence with respect to previous\nexperience during sleep.\n2.3 Empirical evidence on the question of dream experience\n\nUnlike Malcolm, many believe that whether dreams are experiences is an\nempirical question; and unlike Dennett, the predominant view is that\nthe empirical evidence does indeed support this claim\n(Flanagan 2000; Metzinger 2003; Revonsuo 2006; Rosen 2013; Windt 2013,\n2015a).\n\nA first reason for thinking that dreams are experiences during sleep\nis the relationship between dreaming and REM (rapid eye movement)\nsleep. Researchers in the 1950s discovered that sleep is not a uniform\nstate of rest and passivity, but there is a sleep architecture\ninvolving different stages of sleep that is relatively stable both\nwithin and across individuals (Aserinsky & Kleitman 1953, 1955;\nDement & Kleitman 1957). Following sleep onset, periods of non-REM\n(or NREM) sleep including slow wave sleep (so called because of the\npresence of characteristic slow-wave, high-voltage EEG activity) are\nfollowed by periods of high-frequency, low-voltage activity during REM\nsleep. EEG measures from REM sleep strongly resemble waking EEG. REM\nsleep is additionally characterized by rapid eye movements and a\nnear-complete loss of muscle tone (Dement 1999: 27\u201350; Jouvet\n1999).\n\nThe alignment between conscious experience on the one hand and\nwake-like brain activity and muscular paralysis on the other hand\nwould seem to support the experiential status of dreams as well as\nexplain the outward passivity that typically accompanies them. Reports\nof dreaming are in fact much more frequent following REM (81.9%) than\nNREM sleep awakenings (43%; Nielsen 2000). REM reports tend to be more\nelaborate, vivid, and emotionally intense, whereas NREM reports tend\nto be more thought-like, confused, non-progressive, and repetitive\n(Hobson et al. 2000). These differences led to the idea that REM sleep\nis an objective marker of dreaming (Dement & Kleitman 1957; Hobson\n1988: 154).\n\nAttempts to identify dreaming with mental activity during REM sleep\nhave not, however, been successful, and many now hold that dreams can\noccur in all stages of sleep (e.g., Antrobus 1990; Foulkes 1993b;\nSolms 1997, 2000; Domhoff 2003; Nemeth & Fazekas 2018). In recent\nyears there has been renewed interest in NREM sleep for the study of\ndreaming (Noreika et al. 2009; Siclari et al. 2013, 2017). This\nsuggests the inference from the physiology of REM sleep to the\nphenomenology of dreaming is not straightforward.\n\nA second line of evidence comes from lucid dreams, or dreams in which\none knows one is dreaming and often has some level of dream control\n(Voss et al. 2013; Voss & Hobson 2015; Baird et al. 2019). The\nterm lucid dreaming was coined by van Eeden (1913), but Aristotle\n(On Dreams) already noted that one can sometimes be aware\nwhile dreaming that one is dreaming.\n\nScientific evidence that lucid dreaming is real and a genuine sleep\nphenomenon comes from laboratory studies (Hearne 1978; LaBerge et al.\n1981) showing lucid dreamers can use specific, pre-arranged patterns\nof eye movements (e.g., right-left-right-left) to signal in real-time\nthat they are now lucid and engaging in dream experiments. These\nsignals are clearly identifiable on the EOG and suggest a\ncorrespondence between dream-eye movements and real-eye movements (as\npredicted by the so-called scanning hypothesis; see Dement\n& Kleitman 1957; Leclair-Visonneau et al. 2010). Retrospective\nreports confirm that the dreamer really was lucid and signalled\nlucidity (Dresler et al. 2012; Stumbrys et al. 2014).\n\nSignal-verified lucid dreams have been used to study muscular activity\naccompanying body movements in dreams (Erlacher et al. 2003; Dresler\net al. 2011), for advanced EEG analysis of brain activity during lucid\ndreaming (Voss et al. 2009), and imaging studies (Dresler et al. 2011,\n2012). Eye signals can also be used to measure the duration of\ndifferent activities performed in lucid dreams; contrary to the\ncassette theory, lucid dreams have temporal extension and certain\ndream actions even seem to take slightly longer than in waking\n(Erlacher et al. 2014). There have also been attempts to induce\nlucidity through non-invasive electrical stimulation during sleep\n(Stumbrys et al. 2013; Voss et al. 2014). The combination of\nsignal-verified lucid dreaming with volitional control over dream\ncontent, retrospective report, and objective sleep measures has been\nproposed to provide controlled conditions for the study of conscious\nexperience in sleep and a new methodology for investigating the\nrelationship between conscious experience and neurophysiological\nprocesses (Baird et al.2019).\n\nA third line of evidence (Revonsuo 2006: 77) comes from\ndream-enactment behavior (Nielsen et al. 2009), most prominently in\npatients with REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD; Schenck & Mahowald\n1996; Schenck 2005; Leclair-Visonneau et al. 2010). Due to a loss of\nthe muscular atonia that accompanies REM sleep in healthy subjects,\nthese patients show complex, seemingly goal-directed outward behaviors\nsuch as running or fighting off an attacker during REM sleep.\nRetrospective dream reports often match these behaviors, suggesting\nthat patients literally act out their dreams during sleep.\n\nWhile persuasive, these lines of evidence might not satisfy skeptics\nabout dream experience. They might worry that results from lucid\ndreaming and dream enactment do not generalize to ordinary, non-lucid\ndreams; they might also construe alternative explanations that do not\nrequire conscious experience in sleep. There are also methodological\nconcerns, for instance about how closely sleep-behaviors actually\nmatch dream experience. A key issue is that to support the\nexperiential status of dreams, evidence from sleep polysomnography,\nsignal verified lucid dreams, or sleep behavior requires convergence\nwith retrospective dream reports. This means trusting dream reports is\nbuilt into any attempt to empirically resolve the question of dream\nexperience \u2013 which then invites the familiar skeptical concerns.\nAgain, an anti-skeptical strategy may be to appeal to explanatory\nconsiderations. In this view, the convergence of dream reports and\nobjective polysomnographic or behavioral observations is best\nexplained by the assumption that dreams are experiences in sleep, and\nthis assumption is strengthened by further incoming findings. This\nstrategy places dream reports at the center of scientific dream\nresearch while avoiding the contentious claim that their\ntrustworthiness, and with it the experiential status of dreams, can be\ndemonstrated conclusively by independent empirical means (Windt 2013,\n2015a). \n2.4 Dreams and hallucinations\n\nEven where philosophers agree dreams are experiences, they often\ndisagree on how exactly to characterize dreaming relative to\nwake-state psychological terms. Often, questions about the ontology of\ndreaming intersect with epistemological issues. Increasingly, they\nalso incorporate empirical findings.\n\nThe standard view is that dreams have the same phenomenal character as\nwaking perception in that they seemingly put us in contact with\nmind-independent objects, yet no such object is actually being\nperceived. This means dreams count as hallucinations in the\nphilosophical sense (Crane & French 2017; Macpherson 2013). Even\nif, in a particularly realistic dream, my visual experience was\nexactly as it would be if I were awake (I could see my bedroom, my\nhands on the bed sheets, etc.), as long as my eyes were closed during\nthe episode, I would not, literally, be seeing anything.\n\nThere is some controversy in the psychological literature about\nwhether dreams should be regarded as hallucinations. Some believe the\nterm hallucination should be reserved for clinical contexts and\nwake-state pathologies (Aleman & Lar\u00f8i 2008: 17; but see\nffytche 2007; ffytche et al. 2010).\n\nThe view that dreams involve hallucinations is implicit in\nDescartes\u2019 assumption that even when dreaming,\n\n\nit is certain that I seem to see light, hear a noise, and feel heat;\nthis cannot be false, and this is what in me is properly called\nperceiving (sentire). (Descartes 1641: II.9) \n\n\nIt also lies at the heart of Aristotle\u2019s (On Dreams)\nassumption that dreams result from the movements of the sensory organs\nthat continue even after the original stimulus has ceased. He believed\nthat in the silence of sleep, these residual movements result in vivid\nsensory imagery that is subjectively indistinguishable from genuine\nperception (see also Dreisbach 2000; Barbera 2008).\n\nThe assumption of phenomenological equivalence between dream and\nwaking experience can also be found in Berkeley\u2019s (1710: I.18)\nidealist claim that the existence of external bodies is not necessary\nfor the production of vivid, wake-like perceptual experience.\nSimilarly, Russell defended sense-data theory by noting that in\ndreams, \n\n\nI have all the experiences that I seem to have; it is only things\noutside my mind that are not as I believe them to be while I am\ndreaming. (Russell 1948: 149\u2013150) \n\n\nElsewhere, he argued dreams and waking life\n\n\nmust be treated with equal respect; it is only by some reality not\nmerely sensible that dreams can be condemned. (Russell 1914:\n69) \n\n\nHume was less clear on this matter, proposing that dreams occupy an\nintermediate position between vivid and largely non-voluntary sensory\nimpressions and ideas, or \u201cthe faint images of previous\nimpressions in thinking and reasoning\u201d (Hume 1739: 1.1.1.1). On\nthe one hand, as mere creatures of the mind, Hume wanted to categorize\ndreams as ideas. On the other hand, he acknowledged that in sleep,\n\u201cour ideas can approach the vivacity of sensory\nimpressions\u201d (Hume 1739: 1.1.1.1). Dreams do not fit comfortably\ninto Hume\u2019s attempt to draw a dichotomous distinction between\nimpressions, including perception, and ideas, including sensory\nimagination (Ryle 1949; Waxman 1994; Broughton 2006).\n\nPhenomenologists often focus not so much on the quality of dream\nimagery as on the overall character of experience, noting that dreams\nare experienced as reality; as in waking perception, we simply feel\npresent in a world. This also sets dreams apart from waking fantasy\nand daydreams (Husserl 1904/1905; Uslar 1964; Conrad 1968; Globus\n1987: 89. \n\nAt its strongest, the hallucination view claims that dreaming and\nwaking experience are identical in both the quality of sensory imagery\nand their overall, self-in-a-world structure (Revonsuo 2006: 84). This\nclaim is central to the virtual reality metaphor, according\nto which consciousness itself is dreamlike and waking perception a\nkind of online hallucination modulated by the senses (Llin\u00e1s\n& Ribary 1994; Llin\u00e1s & Par\u00e9 1991; Revonsuo\n2006; Metzinger 2003, 2009).\n\nThis seems to be empirically supported. Neuroimaging studies (Dang-Vu\net al. 2007; Nir & Tononi 2010; Desseilles et al. 2011) show that\nthe predominance of visual and motor imagery as well as strong\nemotions in dreams is paralleled by high activation of the\ncorresponding brain areas in REM sleep, which may exceed waking; at\nthe same time, the cognitive deficits often thought to characterize\ndreams such as the loss of self-awareness, the absence of critical\nthinking, delusional reasoning, and mnemonic deficits fit in well with\nthe comparative deactivation of frontal areas (Hobson et al. 2000).\nHobson (1988, Hobson et al. 2000) has argued that the vivid,\nhallucinatory character of dreaming results from the fact that in REM\nsleep, the visual and motor areas are activated in the same way as in\nwaking perception, the sole difference being dreams\u2019 dependence on\ninternal signal generation. Horikawa and colleagues (2013) used\nneuroimaging data from sleep onset to predict the types of objects\ndescribed in mentation reports, which they took to support the\nperceptual equivalence between dreaming and waking. \n\nGenerally, versions of the hallucination view that suggest dreams\nreplicate all aspects of waking perception are too vague to be\ninformative. Especially for subtle perceptual activities (such as\nvisual search), we might not know enough about dream phenomenology to\nmake any strong claims (Nielsen 2010). Specifying points of similarity\nleads to a more informative and precise, but likely also more nuanced\nview. Dreams are heterogeneous, and some might be more perception-like\nwhile others resemble imagination (Windt 2015a). There might also be\ndifferences between or even within specific types of imagery. For\nexample, visual imagery might be quite different from touch\nsensations, which tend to be rare in dreams (Hobson 1988). Visual\ndream imagery might overall resemble waking perception but lack color\nsaturation, background detail and focus (Rechtschaffen &\nBuchignani, 1992). Classifying dreams as either hallucinatory or\nimaginative is further complicated by the fact that there is strong\noverlap in cortical activity associated with both visual imagery and\nperception (Zeidman & Maguire, 2016). This means even a strong\noverlap in cortical activity between, say, visual dream imagery and\nvisual perception does not necessarily set dreaming apart from waking\nimagination.\n\nThis is also true for evidence on eye movements in dreams. LaBerge and\ncolleagues (2018) recently showed that eye tracking of objects is\nsmooth in lucid dreaming and perceiving, but not in imagining. Drawing\nfrom this evidence, Rosen (forthcoming) suggests many dreams mimic the\nphenomenology of interacting with a stable world, including eye\nmovements and visual search. Others argue we should not analogize\ndream imagery to mind-independent, scannable objects and that eye\nmovements might instead be implicated in the generation of dream\nimagery (Windt 2018).\n2.5 Dreams and illusions\n\nAnother way to make sense of the claim that dreaming has the same\nphenomenal character as waking perception is to say some kinds of\ndream imagery are illusory: they involve misperception of an external\nobject as having different properties than it actually has (cf. Smith\n2002; Crane & French 2017). The illusion view disagrees with the\nhallucination view on whether dreams have a contemporaneous external\nstimulus source.\n\nThe illusion view has fallen out of favor but has a long history. The\nAncients believed dreams have bodily sources. This idea underlies the\npractice of using dreams to diagnose illness, as practiced in the\nshrines at Epidaurus (Galen On Diagnosis in Dreams; van de\nCastle 1994). Aristotle (On Dreams) thought some dreams are\ncaused by indigestion, and Hobbes adopted this view, claiming\ndifferent kinds of dreams could be traced to different bodily\nsensations. For instance, \u201clying cold breedeth Dreams of Feare,\nand raiseth the thought and Image of some fearfull object\u201d\n(Hobbes 1651: 91).\n\nAppeals to the bodily sources of dreaming became especially popular in\nthe 19th and early 20th centuries. Many believed\nspecific dream themes such as flying were linked to sleeping position\n(Macnish 1838; Scherner 1861; Vold 1910/1912; Ellis 1911) and\nrealizing, in sleep, that one\u2019s feet are not touching the ground\n(Bergson 1914).\n\nThere were also attempts to explain the phenomenology of dreaming by\nappealing to the absence of outward movement. The lack of appropriate\nfeedback and of movement and touch sensations was thought to cause\ndreams of being unable to move (Bradley 1894) or of trying but failing\nto do something (Gregory 1918).\n\nSome proponents of the \u201cLeibreiztheorie\u201d (or\nsomatic-stimulus theory) of dreaming attempted to go beyond anecdotal\nobservations to conduct controlled experiments. Weygandt (1893)\ninvestigated the influence of various factors including breathing,\nblood circulation, temperature changes, urge to urinate, sleeping\nposition, and visual or auditory stimulation during sleep on dream\ncontent (see Schredl 2010 for details). Singer (1924) proposed\nexperiments on stimulus incorporation in dreams can inform claims on\nthe ontology of dreaming: If dreams are sensations, a particular\nauditory stimulus should increase the frequency of dreams in nearby\nsleepers as well as the frequency of sound in their dreams, and it\nshould decrease the range of quality and intensity of these dreams,\nmaking them overall more similar and predictable.\n\nNewer studies provide evidence for the incorporation of external\nstimuli in dreams, including light flashes, sounds, sprays of water\napplied to the skin (Dement & Wolpert 1958), thermal (Baldridge\n1966), electrical (Koulack 1969), and verbal stimuli (Berger 1963;\nBreger et al. 1971; Hoelscher et al., 1981), as well as blood pressure\ncuff stimulation on the leg (Nielsen et al. 1995; Sauvageau et al.\n1998).\n\nMuscular activity also often leaves its mark on dreams. It occurs\nthroughout sleep but is especially frequent in REM sleep, mostly in\nthe form of twitching but occasionally also in the form of larger,\nseemingly goal-directed movements (Blumberg 2010; Blumberg &\nPlumeau 2016). The relation between outward and dream movements is\ncomplex: in some cases, outward movements might mirror dream\nmovements, while in others, sensory feedback might prompt dream\nimagery (Windt 2018).\n\nGenerally, it seems external and bodily stimuli can be related to\nvarying degrees to dream and sleep onset imagery (Nielsen 2017; Windt\n2018; Windt et al. 2016). Some of these cases appear to fit the\nconcept of illusion, as in when the sound of the alarm clock is\nexperienced, in a dream, as a siren, or when blood pressure cuff\ninflation on the leg leads to dreams of wearing strange shoes (Windt\n2018; for these and other examples, see Nielsen et al. 1995). In other\ncases, such as when blood pressure cuff stimulation on the leg prompts\na dream of seeing someone else\u2019s leg being run over, describing this\nas illusory misperception might be less straightforward.\n\nSaying that dreams can be prompted by external stimuli and that in\nsome cases these are best described as illusions is different from the\nstronger claim, sometimes advanced by historical proponents of\nsomatic-stimulus theory, that dreams generally are caused by\nexternal or bodily stimuli. As an example of the stronger claim,\nconsider Wundt\u2019s proposal that the\n\n\nideas which arise in dreams come, at least to a great extent, from\nsensations, especially from those of the general sense, and are\ntherefore mostly illusions of fancy, probably only seldom pure memory\nideas which hence become hallucinations. (Wundt 1896: 179) \n\n\nThis claim is likely too strong. It is also likely that appeals to\nexternal or bodily stimuli on their own cannot fully explain dream\nimagery, including when and how external stimuli are incorporated in\ndreams. Sensory incorporation in dreams is often hard to predict and\nindirect; associated imagery seems related not just to stimulus\nintensity, but also to short- and long term memories. A full\nexplanation of dream content additionally has to take the cognitive\nand memory sources of dreaming into account (Windt 2018; Nielsen 2017;\ncf. Silberer 1919).\n2.6 Dreams as imaginative experiences\n\nThe most important rival to the hallucination view is that dreams are\nimaginative experiences (Liao & Gendler 2019; Thomas 2014). This\ncan mean dream imagery involves imaginings rather than percepts\n(including hallucinations or illusions; McGinn 2004), that dream\nbeliefs are imaginative and not real beliefs (Sosa 2007), or both\n(Ichikawa 2008, 2009). An important advantage is that by assimilating\ndreams to commonplace mental states such as waking fantasy and\ndaydreaming, rather than a rare and often pathological occurrence such\nas hallucinations, it provides a more unified account of mental life\n(Stone 1984). However, the reasons for adopting the imagination view\nare diverse, and dreams have been proposed to resemble imaginings and\ndiffer from perception along a number of dimensions (e.g. McGinn 2004,\n2005a,b; Thomas 2014). This issue is complicated by the fact that\nthere is little agreement on the definition of imagination and its\nrelation to perception (Kind 2013).\n\nOne way is to deny dreams involve presence or the feeling of being in\na world, which many believe is central to waking perception.\nImagination theorists compare the sense in which we feel present in\nour dreams to cognitive absorption, as when we are lost in a novel,\nfilm, or vivid daydream (Sartre 1940; McGinn 2004; but see Hering\n1947; Globus 1987). Some argue that reflexive consciousness or\nmeta-awareness (as in lucid dreams) interrupts cognitive absorption\nand terminates the ongoing dream (Sartre 1940), essentially denying\nlucid dreams are possible.\n\nAnother issue is whether dreams are subject to the will\n(Ichikawa 2009). Imagination is often characterized as active and\nunder our control (Wittgenstein 1967: 621, 633), involving \u201ca\nspecial effort of the mind\u201d (Descartes 1641: VI, 2), whereas\nperception is passive. Because dreams just seem to happen to us\nwithout being under voluntary control, they present an important\nchallenge for the imagination view. Ichikawa (2009) argues lucid\ncontrol dreams show dreams are generally subject to the will even\nwhere they are not under deliberate control.\n\nDreams are widely described as more indeterminate than waking\nperception (James 1890: 47; Stone 1984). In scientific dream research,\nvagueness is regarded as one of three main subtypes of bizarreness\n(Hobson 1988; Revonsuo & Salmivalli 1995). An example are dream\ncharacters who are identified not by their behavior or looks, but by\njust knowing (Kahn et al. 2000, 2002; Revonsuo & Tarkko\n2002). Dreams are also attention-dependent and lack\nforeground-background structure (Thompson 2014); while it is tempting\nto construe the dream world as rich in detail, there is no more to\ndreams than meets the eye, and many think dream experience is\nexhausted by what is the focus of selective attention (Hunter 1983;\nThompson 2014).\n\nIndeterminacy is also related to the question of whether we dream in\ncolor or in black and white. Based on a review of historical and\nrecent studies, Schwitzgebel (2002, 2011) argues there has been a\nshift in theories on dream color that coincides with the rise first of\nblack-and-white and then color television. He argues it is unlikely\nthat dreams themselves changed from colored to black and white and\nback to colored, proposing that a change in opinion is a more\nplausible explanation. Maybe dreams were either black and white or\ncolored all along; or maybe they are indeterminate with respect to\ncolor, as may be the case for imagined or fictional objects; were this\nthe case, it would strengthen the imagination view (Ichikawa 2009).\nSchwitzgebel\u2019s main point is that reports of colored dreaming are\nunreliable and our opinions about dreams can be mistaken (but see\nWindt 2013, 2015a). This relates to Schwitzgebel\u2019s (2011; Hurlburt\n& Schwitzgebel 2007) general skepticism about the reliability of\nintrospection.\n\nThe issue of dream color has led to a number of follow-up studies\n(Schwitzgebel 2003; Schwitzgebel et al. 2006; Murzyn 2008; Schredl et\nal. 2008; Hoss 2010). They suggest most people dream in color and a\nsmall percentage describe grayscale or even mixed dreams (Murzyn 2008)\nor dreams involving moderate color saturation (Rechtschaffen and\nBuchignani 1992). Indeterminacy is rarely reported.\n\nThe imagination view has consequences for Cartesian dream skepticism.\nIf dream pain does not feel like real pain, there is a fail-safe way\nto determine whether one is now dreaming: one need only pinch oneself\n(Nelson 1966; Stone 1984; but see Hodges & Carter 1969; Kantor\n1970). As Locke put it,\n\n\nif our dreamer pleases to try, whether the glowing heat of a glass\nfurnace, be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man\u2019s\nfancy, by putting his hand into it, he may perhaps be wakened into a\ncertainty greater than he could wish, that it is something more than\nbare imagination. (Locke 1689: IV.XI.8) \n\n\nIf dreaming feels different from waking, this raises the question why\nwe tend to describe dreams in the same terms as waking perception.\nMaybe this is because most people haven\u2019t thought about these matters\nand they would find the imagination view plausible if they considered\nit (Ichikawa 2009). Or maybe\n\n\nit is just because we all know that dreams are throughout\nunlike waking experiences that we can safely use ordinary\nexpressions in the narration of them. (Austin 1962: 42) \n\n\nSome authors classify dreams as imaginings while acknowledging they\nfeel like perceiving. For example, Hobbes describes dreams as\n\u201cthe imaginations of them that sleep\u201d (Hobbes 1651: 90),\nand imagination as a \u201cdecaying sense\u201d (Hobbes\n1651: 88). Yet he also uses the concepts of imagination and fancy to\ndescribe perception and argues \u201ctheir appearance to us is Fancy,\nthe same waking, that dreaming\u201d (Hobbes 1651: 86).\n\nIn the scientific literature, the imagination view is complemented by\ncognitive theories. Foulkes (1978: 5) describes dreaming as a form of\nthinking with its own grammar and syntax, but allows that dream\nimagery is sufficently perception-like to deceive us. Domhoff\u2019s\nneurocognitive model of dreaming (2001, 2003) emphasizes the\ndependence of dreaming on visuospatial skills and on a network\nincluding the association areas of the forebrain. The theory draws\nfrom findings on the partial or global cessation of dreaming following\nbrain lesions (cf. Solms 1997, 2000), evidence that dreaming develops\ngradually and in tandem with visuospatial skills in children (Foulkes\n1993a, 1999; but see Resnick et al. 1994), and results from dream\ncontent analysis supporting the continuity of dreaming with waking\nconcerns and memories (the so-called continuity hypothesis;\nsee Domhoff 2001, 2003; Schredl & Hofmann 2003; Schredl 2006; see\nalso Nir & Tononi 2010).\n2.7 Dreaming and waking mind wandering\n\nA number of researchers have begun to consider dreaming in the context\nof theories of mind wandering. Mind wandering is frequent in waking\nand involves spontaneous thoughts that unfold dynamically and are only\nweakly constrained by ongoing tasks and environmental demands\n(Schooler et al. 2011; Smallwood & Schooler 2015; Christoff et al.\n2016). Based on phenomenological and neurophysiological similarities,\ndreams have been proposed to be an intensified form of waking mind\nwandering (Pace-Schott 2007, 2013; Domhoff 2011; Wamsley 2013; Fox et\nal. 2013). This basic idea seems to have been anticipated by Leibniz,\nwho noted that the spontaneous formation of visions in dreams\nsurpasses the capacity of our waking imagination (Leibniz,\nPhilosophical Papers and Letters, Vol. I, 177\u2013178).\n\nThe analogy between dreams and waking mind wandering has been\ndiscussed in the context of cognitive agency. Metzinger (2013a,b,\n2015) describes dreams and waking mind wandering as involving a\ncyclically recurring loss of mental autonomy, or the ability to\ndeliberately control one\u2019s conscious thought processes. Dreams\nand waking mind wandering are not mental actions but unintentional\nmental behaviors, comparable to subpersonal processes such as\nbreathing or heartbeat. Because dreaming and waking mind wandering\nmake up a the majority of our conscious mental lives, he argues that\ncognitive agency and mental autonomy are the exception, not the\nrule.\n\nThis raises the question of how to make sense of lucid control dreams,\nwhich involve both meta-awareness and agency. Windt and Voss (2018)\nargue that in such cases, spontaneous processes including imagery\nformation co-exist alongside more deliberate, top-down control; they\nalso argue metacognitive insight and control themselves can have\nspontaneous elements. This suggests spontaneity and control are not\nopposites, but a more complex account is needed. Possibly, certain\ndreams and instances of waking mind wandering can be both spontaneous\nand agentive.\n\nThe analogy with mind wandering might help move forward the debate on\nthe ontology of dreaming. In this debate, a common assumption is that\ndreams can be categorized as either hallucinatory or imaginative. Yet\nthe application of these terms to dreams quickly runs into\ncounterexamples and it is unclear they are mutually exclusive. One\noption is pluralism (Rosen 2018b), in which some aspects of dreaming\nare hallucinatory, others imaginative, and yet again others illusory.\nAnother is that dreams are sui generis, combining aspects associated\nwith wake states such as hallucinating, imagining, or perceiving in a\nnovel manner without mimicking them completely. Windt (2015a) proposes\nthat mind wandering, which describes a range of mental states loosely\ncharacterized by their spontaneous and dynamic character, might be\nparticularly suitable for the characterization of dreaming precisely\nbecause that term leaves open more specific questions on the\nphenomenology of dreaming, allowing for variation in control,\ndeterminacy, and so on. This might be a good starting point for\ndescribing what is unique about dreaming while also acknowledging\ncontinuities across sleep-wake states and capitalizing on the\nstrengths of the hallucination, illusion, imagination, and cognitive\nviews.\n2.8 The problem of dream belief\n\nThe second strand of the imagination view argues that dream beliefs\nare not real beliefs, but propositional imaginings. This may or may\nnot be combined with the claim that dream imagery is imaginative\nrather than perceptual (Sosa 2007; Ichikawa 2009).\n\nDenying that dream beliefs have the status of real beliefs only makes\nsense before the background of a specific account of what beliefs are\nand how they are distinguished from other mental states such as\ndelusions or propositional imaginings. For instance, Ichikawa (2009)\nargues that if we follow interpretationist or dispositionalist\naccounts of belief, dream beliefs fall short of real beliefs. He\nclaims dream beliefs lack connection with perceptual experience and\nfail to motivate actions; consequently, they do not have the same\nfunctional role as real beliefs. Moreover, we cannot ascribe dream\nbeliefs to a person by observing them lying asleep in bed. Dream\nbeliefs are often inconsistent with longstanding waking beliefs and\nacquired and discarded without any process of belief revision\n(Ichikawa 2009).\n\nThis analysis of dream beliefs has consequences for skepticism. If\ndream beliefs are propositional imaginings, then we do not falsely\nbelieve while dreaming that we are now awake, but only imagine that we\ndo (Sosa 2007). It is not clear though that this protects us from\ndeception. If dream beliefs fall short of real beliefs, this might\neven make the specter of dream deception more worrisome: in mistaking\ndream beliefs for the real thing, we would now be deceived about the\nstatus of our own mental states (Ichikawa 2008).\n\nIt is also not clear whether the same type of argument extends to\nmental states other than beliefs. As Lewis points out, a person\nmight\n\n\nin fact believe or realize in the course of a dream that he was\ndreaming, and even if we said that, in such case, he only dreamt that\nhe was dreaming, this still leaves it possible for someone who is\nasleep to entertain at the time the thought that he is asleep. (Lewis\n1969: 133) \n\n\nMental states other than believing such as entertaining, thinking, or\nminimally appraisive instances of taking for granted might be\nsufficient for deception (Reed 1979).\n\nThe debate about dream beliefs is paralleled by a debate about whether\ndelusions are beliefs or imaginings (see Currie 2000; Currie &\nRavenscroft 2002; McGinn 2004; Bayne & Pacherie 2005; Bortolotti\n2009; Gendler 2013). Both debates might plausibly inform each other,\nespecially as dreams are sometimes proposed to be delusional (Hobson\n1999).\n3. Dreaming and theories of consciousness\n3.1 Dreaming as a model system and test case for consciousness research\n\nDreams are a global state of consciousness in which experience arises\nunder altered behavioral and neurophysiological conditions as compared\nto standard wakefulness; unlike other altered states of consciousness\n(such as drug-induced or deep meditative states) and pathological wake\nstates (such as psychosis or neurological syndromes), dreams occur\nspontaneously and regularly in healthy subjects. For both reasons,\nmany regard dreams as a test case for theories of consciousness or\neven an ideal model system for consciousness research (Churchland 1988;\nRevonsuo 2006).\n\nExisting proposals differ on the phenomenology of dreaming: referring\nto dream bizarreness, Churchland describes dream experience as\nrobustly different from waking, whereas Revonsuo argues dreaming is\nsimilar to waking and the purest form of experience:\n\n\nthe dreaming brain brings out the phenomenal level of organization in\na clear and distinct form. Dreaming is phenomenality pure and simple,\nuntouched by external physical stimulation or behavioural activity.\n(Revonsuo 2006: 75) \n\n\nRevonsuo argues dreaming reveals the basic, state-independent\nstructure of consciousness to be immersive: \u201cdreaming depicts\nconsciousness first and foremost as a subjective\nworld-for-me\u201d (Revonsuo 2006: 75). This leads him to\nintroduce the \u201cworld-simulation metaphor of\nconsciousness\u201d, according to which consciousness itself is\nessentially simulational and dreamlike. This is taken to support\ninternalism about conscious experience.\n\nThis latter claim is also contentious. No\u00eb (2004: 213) argues\nthat phenomenological differences between dreaming and waking (such as\ngreater instability of visual dream imagery) result from the lack of\ndynamic interaction with the environment in dreams. He proposes this\nshows that neural states are sufficient for dreaming but denies they\nare also sufficient for perceptual experience.\n\nA possible problem for both views is their reliance on background\nassumptions about the phenomenology of dreaming and its disconnection\nfrom environmental stimuli and bodily sensations. Windt (2015a, 2018)\nargues both internalism and externalism mistakenly assume dreams to be\nisolated from external sensory input and own-body perception; she\nbelieves both the phenomenology of dreaming and its correlation with\nexternal stimuli are complex and variable. She argues the analysis of\ndreaming does not clearly support either side in the debate on\ninternalism vs externalism (but see Rosen 2018a). Generally, in the\nabsence of a well worked out theory of dreaming and its sleep-stage\nand neural correlates, proposals for using dreaming as a model system\nor test case run the risk of relying on an oversimplified description\nof the target phenomenon (Windt & Noreika 2011).\n\nRecent accounts appealing to generative models and predictive\nprocessing (Clark 2013b; Hohwy 2013) suggest a new, unified account of\nperception, imagination, and dreaming. In these accounts, different\nmental states, including perception and action, embody different\nstrategies of hypothesis testing and prediction error minimization.\nPerception is the attempt to model the hidden external causes of\nsensory stimuli; action involves keeping the internal model stable\nwhile changing the sensory input. Clark argues that on such a\nmodel,\n\n\nsystems that know how to perceive an object as a cat are thus systems\nthat, ipso facto, are able to use a top-down cascade to bring\nabout the kinds of activity pattern that would be characteristic of\nthe presence of a cat. [\u2026] Perceivers like us, if this is\ncorrect, are inevitably potential dreamers and imaginers too.\nMoreover, they are beings who, in dreaming and imagining, are\ndeploying many of the very same strategies and resources used in\nordinary perception. (Clark 2013a: 764) \n\n\nPredictive processing accounts have also been used to explain specific\nfeatures of dreaming. Bizarreness has been associated with the\ncomparative lack of external stimulus processing, implying dream\nimagery is relatively unconstrained by prediction errors (cf. Hobson\n& Friston 2012; Fletcher & Frith 2008; Bucci & Grasso\n2017). Windt (2018) suggests a predictive processing account of dream\nimagery generation that links bodily self-experience to own-body\nperception and subtle motor behaviors such as twitching in REM sleep\n(Blumberg 2010; Blumberg & Plumeau 2016). She argues that movement\nsensations in dreams, in relation to REM-sleep related muscle\ntwitching, involve a form of bodily self-sampling in which coordinated\nmuscular activity contributes to the generation and maintenance of a\nbody model. This is important because in predictive processing\naccounts neither the bodily nor the external causes of sensory inputs\nare known; at the same time, having an accurate body model is a\nprerequisite for action, requiring the system to disambiguate between\nself- and other generated changes to sensory inputs. Especially in\nearly development, sleep might provide the ideal conditions for\nexploring one\u2019s own body via subtle but coordinated muscular activity\nwhile processing of visual and auditory stimuli is reduced.\n\nDreams have also been suggested as a test case for whether phenomenal\nconsciousness can be divorced from cognitive access (e.g., Block 2007;\nbut see Cohen & Dennett 2011). Sebasti\u00e1n (2014a) argues\nthat dreams provide empirical evidence that conscious experience can\noccur independently of cognitive access. This is because during\n(non-lucid) REM-sleep dreams, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n(dlPFC) as the most plausible mechanism underlying cognitive access is\nselectively deactivated (see also Pantani et al. 2018). This would\nchallenge theories linking conscious experience to access, such as\nhigher-order-thought theory (Sebasti\u00e1n 2014b). However, both\nthe hypoactivation of the dlPCF in REM sleep and its association with\ncognitive access have been debated. Fazekas and Nemeth (2018) suggest\nthat certain kinds of cognitive access may be independent of dlPFC\nactivation, necessitating a more complex account.\n3.2 Dreams, psychosis, and delusions\n\nDreaming has been suggested as a model system not just of waking\nconsciousness in general, but also of psychotic wake states in\nparticular. The analogy between dreaming and madness has a long\nphilosophical history (Plato, Phaedrus; Kant 1766;\nSchopenhauer 1847) and finds particularly stark expression in\nHobson\u2019s claim that \u201cdreaming is not a model of a\npsychosis. It is a psychosis. It\u2019s just a healthy one\u201d\n(Hobson 1999: 44). Gottesmann (2006) proposes dreaming as a\nneurophysiological model of schizophrenia. There is a rich discussion\non the theoretical and methodological implications of dream research\nfor psychiatry (see Scarone et al. 2007; d\u2019Agostino et al. 2013;\nsee Windt & Noreika 2011 as well as the other papers in this\nspecial issue) and a number of studies have investigated differences\nin dream reports from schizophrenic and healthy subjects (Limosani et\nal. 2011a,b).\n\nRather than likening dreaming to waking in general or specific wake\nstates such as psychosis, there have also been attempts to compare\nspecific dream phenomena to wake-state delusions. Gerrans (2012, 2013,\n2014) focuses on character misidentification in dreams and delusions\nof hyperfamiliarity (such as the Fr\u00e9goli delusion, in which\nstrangers are mistakenly identified as family members, and\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) to argue that anomalous experience and\nfaulty reality testing both play a role in delusion formation. Rosen\n(2015) analyzes instances of thought insertion and of auditory\nhallucinations, which are key symptoms of schizophrenia, to raise\nbroader questions about the altered sense of agency in dreams as\ncompared to waking.\n3.3 Beyond dreams: Dreamless sleep experience and the concepts of sleep, waking, and consciousness\n\nPhilosophers have focused almost exclusively on dreaming, largely\nleaving to the side questions about dreamless sleep including whether\nit is uniformly unconscious. In recent years there has been a surge of\ninterest in the possibility of dreamless sleep experience and\nfoundational issues about the definition of sleep and waking. This has\nbeen paralleled by growing interest in dreaming in NREM sleep.\n\nConceptually, interest in dreamless sleep experience has been\nfacilitated by the precise definition of dreaming offered by\nsimulation views (Revonsuo et al. 2015). If dreams are immersive sleep\nexperiences characterized by their here-and-now\nstructure, it makes sense to ask whether this is true for all or just\na subset of sleep-related experiences and whether non-immersive sleep\nexperiences exist. By contrast, if dreaming is broadly identified with\nany conscious mentation in sleep (Pagel et al. 2001), there is no\nconceptual space for dreamless sleep experience.\n\nFollowing Thompson's (2014, 2015) discussion of dreamless sleep in\nIndian and Buddhist philosophy, Windt and colleagues (2016; see also\nWindt 2015b) introduce a framework for different kinds of dreamless\nsleep experience ranging from thinking and isolated imagery,\nperception, or bodily sensations, where these lack integration into a\nscene, to minimal kinds of experience lacking imagery or specific\nthought contents. A possible example of minimal phenomenal experience\nin sleep are white dreams, where people report having had experiences\nduring sleep but cannot remember any details. Taken at face value,\nsome white dream reports might describe experiences that lack\nreportable content (Windt 2015b); others might describe forgotten\ndreams or dreams with degraded content (Fazekas et al. 2018). Another\nexample are reports of witnessing dreamless sleep, as described in\ncertain meditation practices. This state is said to involve\nnon-conceptual awareness of sleep, again in the absence of imagery or\nspecific thought contents, and loss of sense of self (Thompson 2014,\n2015). Some schools in Buddhist philosophy explain claims of deep and\ndreamless sleep by saying we never fully lose consciousness in sleep\n(Prasad 2000, 66; and Thompson 2014, 2015).\n\nEmpirically, interest in dreamless sleep experience is paralleled by\nincreasing interest in experiences in NREM sleep (Fazekas et al.\n2018). Most researchers now accept that dreaming is not confined to\nREM sleep, but also occurs at sleep onset and in NREM sleep. The\ndeeper stages of NREM sleep are particularly interesting as they\ninvolve roughly similar proportions of dreaming, unconscious sleep,\nand white dreams (Noreika et al. 2009: Siclari et al. 2013, 2017). In\nthe search for the neural correlates of dreaming vs unconscious\ndreamless sleep, this makes comparisons within the same sleep stage\npossible and avoids confounds involved in comparing presumably\ndreamful REM sleep with presumably dreamless NREM sleep. Findings\nsuggest that activity in the same parietal hot zone underlies dreaming\nin both NREM and REM sleep (Siclari et al. 2017).\n\nWhere sleep and dream research have traditionally tried to identify\nthe sleep stage correlates of dreaming, newer research suggests local\nchanges occurring independently of sleep stages might in fact be more\nrelevant. Traditionally regarded as global, whole-brain phenomena,\nthere is now increasing evidence that sleep itself is locally driven,\nand local changes in sleep depth might be associated with changes in\nsleep-related experience (Siclari & Tononi 2017; Andrillon et al.\n2019). While sleep and dream research are often considered as separate\nfields, changes in how sleep in general and sleep stages in particular\nare defined appear closely associated with changes in the theoretical\nconception of dreaming and its empirical investigation.\n\nHistorically, discoveries about dreaming have precipitated changing\nconceptions of sleep (for an excellent history of the study of sleep\nand dreaming, see Kroker 2007). Following Aristotle (On Sleeping\nand Waking), sleep was traditionally defined in negative terms as\nthe absence of wakefulness and perception. This is still reflected in\nMalcolm\u2019s assumption that \u201cto a person who is sound\nasleep, \u2018dead to the world\u2019, things cannot even\nseem\u201d (Malcolm 1956: 26).  With the discovery of REM sleep,\nsleep came to be regarded as a heterogeneous phenomenon characterized\nby the cyclic alteration of different sleep stages. REM sleep was now\nconsidered as \u201cneither sleeping nor waking. It was obviously a\nthird state of the brain, as different from sleep as sleep is\nfrom wakefulness\u201d (Jouvet 1999: 5). The folk-psychological\ndichotomy between sleep and wakefulness now seemed oversimplified and\nempirically implausible. At the same time dreaming, which had\npreviously been considered as an intermediate state of half-sleeping\nand half-waking, came to be regarded as a genuine sleep phenomenon,\nbut narrowed to REM sleep.  Today, the framework for describing dreams\nand other sleep-related experiences is more precise, but dreaming has\nalso been cast adrift from REM sleep.\n\nA closely associated issue is how to define waking. Crowther\u2019s\n(2018) capacitation thesis casts waking consciousness as a state in\nwhich the individual is fully switched on to their environment, but\nalso to their own epistemic (cf. O\u2019Shaugnessy 2002) and agentive\npotential; the waking individual is empowered to act and think in\ncertain ways, though this potential need not be actualized. By\ncontrast, dreaming is an \u201cimagining-of consciousness\u201d\n(O\u2019Shaughnessy 2002: 430) and consciousness is conceptually tied\nto wakefulness. Because in lucid dreams, the epistemic and agentive\nprofile of waking is at least partly realized, they might, according\nto Crowther, be regarded as closer to waking than nonlucid dreams.\n\nThis account of waking and sleep may also have consequences for the\nimagination model of dreaming and dream skepticism (Soteriou 2017). As\nin the imagination model, dreaming would be passive and action,\nincluding cognitive agency, would be tied to waking. If dreaming\nnonetheless involved passive episodes of imagining oneself to be\nactive, one would be unable to tell that one were dreaming and\nimagining, as this insight would require the exercise of real agency.\nThe sceptical consequence would be that when dreaming, one would lose\nagency as well as the capacity to gain insight into one\u2019s\ncurrent state. Yet our ability to know we are waking when waking would\nbe unscathed; according to Soteriou, waking would thus have an\nepistemic function connected to the capacity to exercise agency over\nour mental lives.\n\nFinally, definitions of consciousness themselves are bound up with\nconceptions of sleep and dreaming. As dreaming went from a state whose\nexperiential status was doubted to being widely recognized as a second\nglobal state of consciousness, consciousness sometimes came to be\ndefined contrastively as that which disappears in deep, dreamless\nsleep and reappears in waking and dreaming (Searle 2000; Tononi 2008).\nIn light of dreamless sleep experience, such definitions are\nproblematic (Thompson 2014, 2015; Windt 2015b; Windt et al. 2016).\nDreamless sleep experience has been proposed to be particularly\nrelevant for understanding minimal phenomenal experience, or the\nconditions under which the simplest kind of conscious experience\narises (Windt 2015b). The investigation of dreamless sleep might thus\nshed light on the transition from unconscious sleep to sleep-related\nexperience.\n4. Dreaming and the self\n\nWe almost always have a self in dreams, though this self can sometimes\nbe a slightly different (e.g. older or younger) version of our waking\nself or even a different person entirely. Dreams therefore raise\ninteresting questions about the identity between the dream and waking\nself. Locke (1689) invites us to imagine two men alternating in turns\nbetween sleep and wakefulness and sharing one continuously thinking\nsoul (Locke 1689: II.I.12). He argues that if one man retained no\nmemory of the soul\u2019s thoughts and perceptions while it was\nlinked to the other man\u2019s body, they would be distinct persons.\nHis position is that personal identity depends on psychological\ncontinuity, including recall: in the absence of recall, as illustrated\nby the toy example of two people sharing one soul, continuous\nconscious thinking does not suffice for identity. Locke also rejects\nthe possibility of unrecalled dreams and the idea that we dream\nthroughout sleep, remembering only a small proportion of our dreams\n(Locke 1689: II.I.19).\n\nValberg distinguishes between the subject of the dream (i.e., the\ndream self) and the sleeping person who is the dreamer of the dream\nand recalls it upon awakening (Valberg 2007). He argues that awakening\nfrom a dream involves crossing a chasm between discrete worlds with\ndiscrete spaces and times; it does not make sense to say that\n\u201cthe \u2018I\u2019 at these times [is] a single individual who\ncrosses from one world to the other\u201d (Valberg 2007: 69).\nAccording to Valberg, this is relevant to dream skepticism because\nthere is no simple way to make sense of the claims that it is I who\nemerge from a dream or that I was the victim of dream deception.\n\nVicarious dreams, or dreams in which the protagonist of the dream\nseems to be a different person from the dreamer, are particularly\npuzzling with respect to identity. They may even raise the question of\nwhether the dream self has an independent existence (Rosen &\nSutton 2013: 1047). Such dreams are superficially similar to cases in\nwhich we imagine being another person, but according to Rosen and\nSutton require a different explanation: in the case of dreaming, the\nimagined person\u2019s thoughts are not framed as diverging from\none\u2019s own and one does not retain one\u2019s own perspective in\naddition to the imagined one; in nonlucid dreams, only the perspective\nof the dream\u2019s protagonist is retained.\n\nThe dream self is also at the center of simulation views of dreaming,\nwhich define dreaming via its immersive, here and now character as the\nexperience of a self in a world. This leads to further questions about\nthe phenomenology of self-experience in dreams and how it is different\nfrom waking self-experience. Different versions of the simulation view\nfocus on different aspects of self- and world experience in dreams,\nranging from social simulation (Revonsuo et al. 2015) to the typical\nfeatures of selfhood in dreams (Revonsuo 2005, 2006, Metzinger 2003,\n2009) to the minimal conditions for experiencing oneself as a self in\ndreams and what this tells us about minimal phenomenal selfhood in\ngeneral (Windt 2015a, 2018). Yet these different versions of the\nsimulation view are largely complementary and together have forged\nunity in a field that was previously hampered by lack of agreement\nabout the definition of dreaming. They also integrate the philosophy\nof dreaming and scientific dream research.\n\nAs so often in debates about dreaming, there is disagreement about\nbasic phenomenological questions. Revonsuo (2005) describes\nself-experience including bodily experience in dreams as identical to\nwaking, whereas Metzinger (2003, 2009; see also Windt & Metzinger\n2007) argues that important layers of waking self-experience (such as\nautobiographical memory, agency, a stable first-person perspective,\nmetacognitive insight, and self-knowledge) are missing in nonlucid\ndreams. He argues this is due to the cognitive and mnemonic deficit\nthat characterizes nonlucid dreams (cf. Hobson et al. 2000). Windt\n(2015a) analyzes the range of cognitive and bodily self-experience in\ndreams, both of which she describes as variable. She argues that in a\nmajority of cases, dreams are weakly phenomenally embodied states in\nwhich bodily experience is largely related to movement sensations but\na detailed and integrated body representation is lacking; instead,\nbodily experience in dreams is largely indeterminate (for an attempt\nto test this empirically, see Koppehele-Gossel et al. 2016). She\nproposes this is because dreams are also weakly functionally embodied\nstates, in which the specific pattern of bodily experience reflects\naltered processing of bodily sensations (as in the illusion view). She\nalso analyzes instances of bodiless dreams, in which dreamers say they\nexperienced themselves as disembodied entities, to argue that\nself-experience can be reduced to pure spatiotemporal-self-location\n(Windt 2010); she proposes these cases can help identify the\nconditions for the emergence of minimal phenomenal selfhood (Blanke\n& Metzinger 2009; see also Metzinger 2013b).\n5. Immorality and moral responsibility in dreams\n\nHow the phenomenology of dreaming compares to waking and what to say\nabout how the dream self relates to the waking self bears on questions\nabout the moral status of dreams. For Augustine (Confessions)\ndreams were a cause of moral concern because of their\nindistinguishability from waking life. What particularly worried him\nabout dreams of sexual acts was their vividness, as well as the\nfeeling of pleasure and seeming acquiescence or consent on the part of\nthe dreamer. He concluded, however, that the transition from sleep to\nwakefulness involves a radical chasm, enabling the dreamer to awaken\nwith a clear conscience and absolving them from taking responsibility\nfor their dream actions.\n\nWhat exactly Augustine thought the chasm between dreaming and waking\nconsists in allows for different interpretations (Matthews 1981).\nFirstly, if the dream and waking self are not identical, then waking\nAugustine is not morally responsible for dream-Augustine\u2019s\nactions. Secondly, actions performed in dreams might be morally\nirrelevant because they did not really happen. And thirdly, assuming\nthat moral responsibility requires the ability to act otherwise,\ndreams provide no grounds for moral concern because we cannot refrain\nfrom having certain types of dreams.\n\nThe issue of dream immorality may also present a choice point between\ndifferent accounts of moral evaluation. Where internalists assume the\nmoral status of a person\u2019s actions is entirely determined by internal\nfactors such as intentions and motives, externalists look beyond these\nto the effects of actions. Driver (2007) argues that the absurdity of\ndream immorality itself should count against purely internalist\naccounts; yet she also acknowledges this absurdity is not a necessary\nfeature of dreams.\n\nCentral to the question of dream immorality is the status of dreams as\nactions rather than mere behaviors. Mullane (1965) argues that while\nwe don\u2019t have full control over our dreams, they are not\ncompletely involuntary either; as is the case for blushing,\nconsiderable effort is required to attain control over our dreams and\nin some cases they can even be considered as actions. That lucid dream\ncontrol is, to some extent, a learnable skill (Stumbrys et al. 2014)\nlends some support to this claim.\n6. The meaning of dreams and the functions of dreaming\n6.1 The meaning of dreams\n\nPhilosophical discussions of dreaming tend to focus on (a) dream\ndeception and (b) questions about the ontology of dreaming, its moral\nstatus, etc., that tend to intersect with dream skepticism. By\ncontrast, the main source of interest in dreams outside of philosophy\ntraditionally has been dream interpretation and whether dreams are a\nsource of knowledge and insight. Historically, the epistemic status of\ndreams and the use of prophetic and diagnostic dreams was not just a\ntheoretical, but a practical problem (Barbera 2008). Different types\nof dreams were distinguished by their putative epistemic\nvalue. Artemidorus, for instance, used the term\nenhypnion to refer to dreams that merely reflect the\nsleeper\u2019s current bodily or psychological state and hence do not\nmerit further interpretation, whereas he reserved the term\noneiron for meaningful and symbolic dreams of divine\norigin.\n\nThe practice of dream interpretation was famously attacked by\nAristotle in On Prophecy in Sleep. He denied that dreams are\nof divine origin, but allowed that occasionally, small affections of\nthe sensory organs as might stem from distant events that cannot be\nperceived in waking are perceptible in the quiet of sleep. He also\nbelieved such dreams were mostly likely to occur in dullards whose\nminds resemble an empty desert \u2013 an assessment that was not apt to\nencourage interest in dreams (Kroker 2007: 37). A similarly negative\nview was held by early modern philosophers who believed dreams were\noften the source of superstitious beliefs (Hobbes 1651; Kant 1766;\nSchopenhauer 1847).\n\nIn Freudian dream theory, dream interpretation once more assumed a\nprominent role as the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious. This\nwas associated with claims about the psychic sources of dreaming.\nFreud (1899) also rejected the influence of external or bodily\nsources, as championed by contemporary proponents of somatic-stimulus\ntheory. \n\nIn the neuroscience of dreaming, Hobson famously argued that dreams\nare the product of the random, brain-stem driven activation of the\nbrain during sleep (Hobson 1988) and at best enable personal insights\nin the same way as a Rorschach test (Hobson et al. 2000). Dennett\n(1991) illustrates the lack of design underlying the production of\ndream narratives through the \u201cparty game of\npsychoanalysis\u201d, which involves an aimless game of\nquestion-and-answer. In the game, players follow simple rules to\njointly produce narratives that can seem symbolic and meaningful, even\nthough no intelligent and deliberate process of narration was\ninvolved.\n\nEven if we grant that dreams are not messages from a hidden entity in\nneed of decoding, this does not imply that dream interpretation cannot\nbe a personally meaningful source of insight and creativity (Hobson\n& Wohl 2005). Whether and under which conditions, and following\nwhich methods, dream interpretation can lead to personally significant\ninsights is an empirical question that is only beginning to be\ninvestigated systematically (see Edwards et al. 2013).\n\nFinally, throughout history, views on the epistemic status of dreams\nand the type of knowledge to be gained from dream interpretation\n(e.g., knowledge about the future, diagnosis of physical illness, or\ninsights about one\u2019s current concerns) often changed in tandem\nwith views on the origin and sources of dreaming, which gradually\nmoved from divine origins and external sources, via the body, to the\nunconscious, and finally to the brain.\n6.2 The functions of dreaming\n\nDifferent theories on the functions of dreaming have been proposed and\nthe debate is ongoing. An important distinction is between the\nfunctions of sleep stages and the functions of dreaming.\nWell-documented functions of REM sleep include thermoregulation and\nthe development of cortical structures in birds and mammals, as well\nas neurotransmitter repletion, the reconstruction and maintenance of\nlittle-used brain circuits, the structural development of the brain in\nearly developmental phases, as well as the preparation of a repertoire\nof reflexive or instinctive behaviors (Hobson 2009). Yet none of these\nfunctions are obviously linked to dreaming. An exception is\nprotoconsciousness theory, in which REM sleep plays an important role\nin foetal development by providing a virtual world model\n even before the emergence of full-blown consciousness (Hobson 2009: 808).\n\nNumerous studies have investigated the contribution of sleep to memory\nconsolidation, with different sleep stages promoting different types\nof memories (Diekelmann et al. 2009; Walker 2009). However, only a few\nstudies have investigated the relationship between dream content and\nmemory consolidation in sleep (for a review, see Nielsen &\nStenstrom 2005). Dreams rarely involve episodic replay of waking\nmemories (Fosse et al. 2003). The incorporation of memory sources\nseems to follow a specific temporal pattern in which recent memories\nare integrated with older but semantically related memories (Blagrove\net al. 2011). Nielsen (2017) presents a model of how external and\nbodily stimuli on one hand and short- and long-term memories on the\nother hand form seemingly novel, complex, and dreamlike images at\nsleep onset; he proposes these microdreams shed light on the formation\nand sources of more complex dreams. There is also some evidence that\ndream imagery might be associated with memory consolidation and task\nperformance after sleep, though this is preliminary (Wamsley &\nStickgold 2009, 2010; Wamsley et al. 2010).\n\nProminent theories on the function of dreaming focus on bad dreams and\nnightmares. It has long been thought that dreaming contributes to\nemotional processing and that this is particularly obvious in the\ndreams of nightmare sufferers or in dreams following traumatic\nexperiences (e.g., Hartmann 1998; Nielsen & Lara-Carrasco 2007;\nLevin & Nielsen 2009; Cartwright 2010; Perogamvros et al. 2013).\nBased on the high prevalence of negative emotions and threatening\ndream content, threat simulation theory suggests that the evolutionary\nfunction of dreaming lies in the simulation of ancestral threats and\nthe rehearsal of threatening events and avoidance skills in dreams has\nan adaptive value by enhancing the individual\u2019s chances of\nsurvival (see Revonsuo 2000; Valli 2008). A more recent proposal is\nsocial simulation theory, in which social imagery in dreams supports\nsocial cognition, bonds, and social skills. (Revonsuo et al.\n2015).\n\nAn evolutionary perspective can also be fruitfully applied to specific\naspects of dream phenomenology. According to the vigilance\nhypothesis, natural selection disfavored the occurrence of those\ntypes of sensations during sleep that would compromise vigilance\n(Symons 1993). Dream sounds, but also smells or pains might distract\nattention from the potentially dangerous surroundings of the sleeping\nsubject, and the vigilance hypothesis predicts that they only rarely\noccur in dreams without causing awakening. By contrast, because most\nmammals sleep with their eyes closed and in an immobile position,\nvivid visual and movement hallucinations during sleep would not\ncomprise vigilance and thus can occur in dreams without endangering\nthe sleeping subject. Focusing on the stuff dreams are not\nmade of might then be at least as important for understanding the\nfunction of dreaming as developing a positive account.\n\nFinally, even if dreaming in general and specific types of dream\ncontent in particular were found to be strongly associated with\nspecific cognitive functions, it would still be possible that dreams\nare mere epiphenomena of brain activity during sleep (Flanagan 1995,\n2000). It is also possible that the function of dreams is not knowable\n(Springett 2019).\n\nA particular problem for any theory on the function of dreaming is to\nexplain why a majority of dreams are forgotten and how dreams can\nfulfill their putative function independently of recall. Crick and\nMitchinson (1983) famously proposed that REM sleep\n\u201cerases\u201d or deletes surplus information and unnecessary\nmemories, which would suggest that enhanced dream recall is\ncounterproductive. Another problem is that dreaming can be lost\nselectively and independently of other cognitive deficits (Solms 1997,\n2000).\n\nSome of the problems that arise for theories on the functions of\ndreaming can be avoided if we do not assume that dreaming has a\nspecific function, separate from the function(s) of conscious wakeful\nstates. This depends on the broader taxonomy of dreaming in relation\nto wakeful states. For example, if dreaming is continuous with waking\nmind wandering, imagination, and/or own-body perception, we should not\nexpect it to have a unique function, but rather to express a similar\nfunction as these wakeful states, perhaps to varying degrees. Nor\nshould we expect dreams to have a single function; the functions of\ndreaming might be as varied and complex as those of consciousness, and\ngiven the complexity of the target phenomenon, the failure to pin down\na single function should not be surprising (Windt 2015a).\n7. Conclusions\n\nQuestions about dreaming in different areas of philosophy such as\nepistemology, ontology, philosophy of mind and cognitive science, and\nethics are closely intertwined. Scientific evidence from sleep and\ndream research can meaningfully inform the philosophical discussion\nand has often done so in the past. The discussion of dreaming has also\noften functioned as a lens on broader questions about knowledge,\nmorality, consciousness, and self. Long a marginalized area, the\nphilosophy of dreaming and of sleep is central to important\nphilosophical questions and increasingly plays an important role in\ninterdisciplinary consciousness research, for example in the search\nfor the neural correlates of conscious states, in conscious state\ntaxonomies, and in research on the minimal conditions for phenomenal\nselfhood and conscious experience.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aleman, A. and F.
