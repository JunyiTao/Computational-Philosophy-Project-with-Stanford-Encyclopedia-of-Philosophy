    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Religious Arguments\n3.3 Religious Arguments\n\nTwo general categories of arguments for the moral impermissibility of\nsuicide have emerged from the Christian religious tradition. The first\nof these is the aforementioned Thomistic natural law position,\ncritiqued by Hume (see\n section 2.3)\n According to this tradition, suicide violates the natural law God has\ncreated to govern the natural world and human existence. This natural\nlaw can be conceived of in terms of (a) natural causal laws, such that\nsuicide violates this causal order, (b) teleological laws, according\nto which all natural beings seek to preserve themselves, or (c) the\nlaws governing human nature, from which it follows that suicide is\n\u2018unnatural\u2019 (Pabst Battin 1996, 41\u201348). These\nnatural law arguments are no longer the main focus of philosophical\ndiscussion, as they have been subjected to strenuous criticism by Hume\nand others (though see Gay-Williams 1996). These criticisms include\nthe following: (1) the natural law arguments cannot be disentangled\nfrom a highly speculative theistic metaphysics; (2) the claims of\nnatural law are confuted by observations of human nature (e.g., the\nexistence of self-destructive human behaviors casts doubt on the claim\nthat we \u201cnaturally\u201d preserve ourselves); and (3) other\nacts (e.g., religious martyrdom) which God is assumed not to condemn,\nalso violate these natural laws, making the prohibition on suicide\nappear arbitrary.\n\nThe second general category of religious arguments rest on analogies\nconcerning the relationship between God and humanity. For the most\npart, these arguments aim to establish that God, and not human\nindividuals, has the proper moral authority to determine the\ncircumstances of their deaths. One historically prominent analogy\n(suggested by Aquinas and Locke) states that we are God\u2019s\nproperty and so suicide is a wrong to God akin to theft or destruction\nof property. This analogy seems weak on several fronts. First, if we\nare God\u2019s property, we are an odd sort of property, in that God\napparently bestowed upon us free will that permits us to act in ways\nthat are inconsistent with God\u2019s wishes or intentions. It is\ndifficult to see how an autonomous entity with free will can be\nsubject to the kind of control or dominion to which other sorts of\nproperty are subject. Second, the argument appears to rest on the\nassumption that God does not wish his property destroyed. Yet given\nthe traditional theistic conception of God as not lacking in any way,\nhow could the destruction of something God owns (a human life) be a\nharm to God or to his interests (Holley 1989, 105)? Third, it is\ndifficult to reconcile this argument with the claim that God is\nall-loving. If a person\u2019s life is sufficiently bad, an\nall-loving God might permit his property to be destroyed through\nsuicide. Finally, some have questioned the extent of the duties\nimposed by God\u2019s property right in us by arguing that the\ndestruction of property might be morally justified in order to prevent\nsignificant harm to oneself. If the only available means to save\nmyself from a ticking bomb is to stash it in the trunk of the nearest\ncar to dampen the blast, and the nearest car belongs to my neighbor,\nthen destroying his property appears justified in order to avoid\nserious harm to myself. Likewise, if only by killing myself can I\navoid a serious future harm to myself, I appear justified in\ndestroying my life even if it is God\u2019s property.\n\nAnother common analogy asserts that God bestows life upon us as a\ngift, and it would be a mark of ingratitude or neglect to reject that\ngift by taking our lives. The obvious weakness with this \u201cgift\nanalogy\u201d is that a gift, genuinely given, does not come with\nconditions such as that suggested by the analogy, i.e., once given, a\ngift becomes the property of its recipient and its giver no longer has\nany claim on what the recipient does with this gift. It may perhaps be\nimprudent to waste an especially valuable gift, but it does not appear\nto be unjust to a gift giver to do so. As Kluge (1975, 124) put it,\n\u201ca gift we cannot reject is not a gift\u201d. A\nvariation of this line of argument holds that we owe God a debt of\ngratitude for our lives, and so to kill ourselves would be\ndisrespectful or even insulting to God, (Ramsey 1978, 146) or would\namount to an irresponsible use of this gift. Yet this variation does\nnot really evade the criticism directed at the first version: Even if\nwe owe God a debt of gratitude, disposing of our lives does not seem\ninconsistent with our expressing gratitude for having lived at all\n(Beauchamp 1992). Furthermore, if a person\u2019s life is rife with\nmisery and unhappiness, it is far from clear that she owes God much in\nthe way of gratitude for this apparently ill-chosen \u201cgift\u201d\nof life. Defenders of the gift analogy must therefore defend the claim\nthat life, simply because it is given to us by a loving God, is an\nexpression of God\u2019s benevolent nature and is therefore\nnecessarily a benefit to us (Holley 1989, 113\u2013114).\n\nIn addition, there is a less recognized undercurrent of religious\nthought that favors suicide. For example, suicide permits us\nto reunite with deceased loved ones, allows those who have been\nabsolved of sin to assure their entrance to heaven, and releases the\nsoul from the bondage of the body. In both Christian and Asian\nreligious traditions, suicide holds the promise of a vision of, or\nunion with, the divine (Pabst Battin 1996, 53\u201364).\n",
