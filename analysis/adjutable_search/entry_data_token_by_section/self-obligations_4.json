Waivable obligations to oneself\n\nOur discussion so far has assumed, following Singer, Kant, and Hobbes,\nthat self-release is fishy \u2013 that one cannot wiggle out of\none\u2019s ethical duties. That is the basic reason why Singer gives\nup on duties to oneself, and it is the basic reason why Kantians\ninsist on decoupling them from waivable rights.\n\nBut what if the assumption is wrong? What if you can release\nyourself from obligations? This brings us to the third and final\nfamily of theories, those that allow waivable obligations to oneself.\nSuch theories confront the Paradox of Self-Release head on.\nSelf-release, after all, certainly seems paradoxical. How can\nwe find a way to resist Hobbes\u2019 dictum \u2013 \u201che is\nfree, that can be free when he will\u201d \u2013 and how might we\nclear the air of paradox?\n\nThe basic problem, as a reminder, is that a waivable duty to oneself\nwould not be binding, because it would not be possible to violate. One\ncould simply waive the duty \u201cwhen one pleaseth\u201d to avoid\ntransgression, as Hobbes\u2019 sovereign might suspend your property\nrights when he wants your stuff.\n\nTo meet this challenge, we need some way to show that such duties,\ndespite appearances, could actually be binding.\n\nThe trailblazer here is G.A. Cohen. He imagines himself in the\nsovereign\u2019s predicament, passing a law that he might later want\nto waive away:\n\nSuppose\u2026that the law is indeed universal, or that it includes\nme within its scope by virtue of some other semantic or pragmatic\nfeature of it. Then, if I had the authority to legislate it, it indeed\nbinds me, as long as I do not repeal it. (1996, 170)\n\n\nIn other words, even if you can be free at will, that\ndoesn\u2019t mean you are free already. You are free when,\nand only when, you go through the motions to free yourself. Until then\nyou are bound \u2013 in this case, by virtue of your power to make\nlaws that apply to you.\n\nCohen\u2019s remarks on the subject, though valuable, are brief.\nMu\u00f1oz (2020, 2021) develops the idea into a bigger picture of\nduties, rights, and waivers. The starting point is a view known as the\nSelf-Other Symmetry: you have the same basic rights against yourself\nas you have against anybody else. But it is uniquely difficult to\nviolate your own rights, Mu\u00f1oz says, because the very choice to\ndo what they forbid doubles as an authorization to do it. By choosing\nto bop yourself on the head, for example, you make yourself into a\nwilling party to the bopping, and thereby waive your right, a bit like\nif you had consenting to being bopped by someone else. The result is\nthat rights against oneself are real but \u201cfinkish\u201d \u2013\nwaived by the very things that normally lead to violations. (The\nanalogy is with finkish dispositions, which are real but hidden by the\nvery things that normally cause them to manifest; imagine a fragile\nglass that turns to stone whenever something is about to strike it\n(see Lewis 1997; Martin 1994).)\n\nBut if a right is finkish, it is hard to see why it should matter. For\nall intents and purposes, it is as good as absent. This challenge is\npressed forcefully by Schofield:\n\nTraditionally understood, a duty binds a person, irrespective of what\nshe herself decides. The powerlessness to escape it through a mere act\nof will is, in fact, part of what it is to be duty-bound. So insofar\nas a person has the power to release herself, the purported duty lacks\nits characteristic ability to place her in the very condition that we\nassociate with duty. (2021, 47)\n\n\nAnd while some might say finkish rights and duties are merely\n\u201cfeeble,\u201d rather than impossible, Schofield (2021, 48)\nreplies that he can see \u201cno reason why we cannot simply deny\naltogether that they are duties.\u201d Finkish duties\n\u201cbind\u201d only in the sense that they count as duties; they\ndo not constrain our actions. (But see \u00a76.2 below on rights\nagainst oneself as prerogatives.)\n\nCould a waivable duty to oneself have any normative bite, anything to\nconstrain how we may act? For there to be a constraint here, waivers\nwould have to be less than automatic, so that the mere choice to bop\nmyself on the head might not waive my duty not to bop myself.\n\nSchaab (2021) argues that a decision might fail to waive a duty to\noneself if the duty and motive come from different perspectives within\nthe agent \u2013 as when someone qua philosopher decides to\nskip the gym to work on a paper even though, qua athlete,\nthey could legitimately demand more exercise. Kanygina (forthcoming)\nargues that self-release must be autonomous. If my decisions\nare \u201cakratic, negligent, or confused,\u201d they will not\nvalidly waive my duties to myself, and while sometimes my state of\nmind will double as an excuse, at other times I may be genuinely\nculpable. Kanygina illustrates with a case:\n\nLinda, a diabetic craving a cake, might tell herself \u2018What harm\nis there in my eating a piece or two?\u2019 Linda is aware of the\nrisks. Being both weak-willed and negligent of her health, she acts\nfrivolously. When she later feels guilty, her guilt seems appropriate.\n(forthcoming, \u00a73.1)\n\n\nIndeed, any version of the Self-Other Symmetry will be committed to a\nversion of Kanygina\u2019s view. It is a truism that interpersonal\nconsent can waive rights only when it is informed, voluntary, and\ncompetent. A breezy \u201cyes\u201d might not cut it. Given\nSymmetry, the same should hold in the one-person case. To authorize\noneself to act in high-stakes cases \u2013 sharing private\ninformation, donating a spare kidney, devoting one\u2019s efforts to\na cause \u2013 the decision must be made carefully in light of the\navailable facts. Even if self-release is possible, that doesn\u2019t\nmean it\u2019s easy.\n",
