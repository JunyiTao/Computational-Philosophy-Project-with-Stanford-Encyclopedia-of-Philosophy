Normative Naturalism\n\nLike the traditional epistemologist, the Normative Naturalist embraces\nas his goal the promulgation of norms by which to regulate our\nepistemic practices\u2014to govern how we should acquire and weigh\nevidence, and ultimately form beliefs. Unlike the non-naturalist,\nhowever, the Normative Naturalist does not think epistemic norms can\nbe adequately formulated from the armchair: normative theorizing must\nbe continuous with scientific theorizing. But if this is not just to\ncollapse into Replacement Naturalism, then what does the M-naturalist\ncredo amount to in the normative case? Consider Goldman\u2019s\nproposal: \u201cEpistemics assumes that cognitive operations should\nbe assessed instrumentally: given a choice of cognitive procedures,\nthose which would produce the best set of consequences should\nbe selected\u201d (1978, p. 520). The Normative Naturalist maintains\nthat the reason the philosopher can\u2019t do armchair epistemology\nis because it is an a posteriori, empirical matter what norms\nin fact serve our epistemic or cognitive goals (e.g., forming\ntrue beliefs). Goldman emphasizes a particularly important instance of\nthis general point:\n\n[A]dvice in matters intellectual, as in other matters, should take\naccount of the agent\u2019s capacities. There is no point in\nrecommending procedures that cognizers cannot follow or recommending\nresults that cognizers cannot attain. As in the ethical sphere,\n\u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan.\u201d Traditional\nepistemology has often ignored this precept. Epistemological rules\noften seem to have been addressed to \u201cideal\u201d cognizers,\nnot human beings with limited information-processing resources.\nEpistemics [as a type of Normative Naturalism] wishes to take its\nregulative role seriously. It does not want to give merely idle\nadvice, which humans are incapable of following. This means it must\ntake account of the powers and limits of the human cognitive system,\nand this requires attention to descriptive psychology. (1978, p. 510)\n\n\nSo the Normative Naturalist thinks that normative epistemology must be\ncontinuous with natural and social science in (at least) two senses:\n(i) we need to know what epistemic norms in fact lead to our forming\ntrue beliefs; and (ii) as a special case of (i), we need to identify\nepistemic norms actually usable by creatures like us. This rules out\ncertain (non-naturalistic) epistemic norms which require of cognizers\nbelief-formation practices beyond their ken (Goldman 1978, pp.\n512\u2013513). The Normative Naturalist, in short, emphasizes the\ninstrumental character of normative theorizing in\nepistemology, and then argues that the only way to assess instrumental\nclaims is empirically\u2014to see what means really brings\nabout what ends. And that task can never be pursued a priori,\nfrom the armchair.\n\nOf course, it bears noting that the Normative Naturalist does not\ndispense entirely with conceptual analysis\u2014to the\ncontrary. It is precisely, for example, Goldman\u2019s proffered\nconceptual analyses of \u201cknowledge\u201d and\n\u201cjustification\u201d that require him to turn to empirical\npsychology to fill in the actual content of epistemic norms. Unlike\nthe Quinean program, naturalization enters for the Normativist only,\nas it were, in applied epistemology. What many philosophers\nmight think of as \u201cpure\u201d epistemology\u2014giving an\naccount of knowledge\u2014continues to be an a priori\nenterprise, even though it is an enterprise that invokes notions (like\n\u201creliability\u201d and \u201ccausation\u201d) that require\na posteriori investigation to apply.\n\nThe Normative Naturalist in jurisprudence, too, views theoretical\nquestions instrumentally. The philosophical foundation of\nevidence law has, to date, received the most attention from this\nperspective (Allen & Leiter 2001; Broughton & Leiter 2021). We\nwant to ask, as Goldman puts it, \u201cWhich [social] practices have\na comparatively favorable impact on knowledge as contrasted with error\nand ignorance?\u201d (1999, p. 5). Normative naturalism is, in this\nrespect, veritistic (to borrow Goldman\u2019s term): it is\nconcerned with the production of knowledge, meaning (in part)\ntrue belief (Goldman 1999, pp. 79\u2013100). So the\nNormative Naturalist embraces as his goal the promulgation of norms by\nwhich to regulate our epistemic practices so that they yield\nknowledge. In the case of individual epistemology, this means\nthe norms governing how individuals should acquire and weigh evidence\nas well as, ultimately, form beliefs; in the case of social\nepistemology, this means the norms governing the social mechanisms and\npractices that inculcate belief. The legal rules of evidence, in turn,\nare a prime case of the latter: for these rules structure the\nepistemic process by which trial jurors arrive at beliefs about\ndisputed matters of fact. As such, the rules of evidence are a natural\ncandidate for investigation by Normative Naturalists. We may ask of\nany particular rule: does it increase the likelihood that jurors will\nreach true beliefs about disputed matters of fact? (Of\ncourse, it does not make sense to ask that of every rule,\nsince some rules of evidence\u2014for example, Federal Rules of\nEvidence (FRE) 407\u2013411\u2014are not meant to facilitate the\ndiscovery of truth, but to carry out various policy objectives like\nreducing accidents and avoiding litigation.) That means, of course,\nasking an essentially empirical question: does a given rule\nof evidentiary inclusion or exclusion in fact increase the\nlikelihood that fact finders, given what they are actually\nlike, will achieve knowledge about disputed matters of fact\n(i.e., does it maximize veritistic value)? Of course, many rules\nthat on their face invite one kind of veritistic analysis require a\nvery different kind in practice. So, for example, FRE 404, on its\nface, excludes character evidence in most contexts, though, in\nfact, the exception in 404(b) largely swallows the rule. Thus, while\nit might seem that we should ask whether excluding character\nevidence maximizes veritistic value, the real question is whether\nadmitting it does. The same may be said for the hearsay rule.\nAlthough on its face, the hearsay doctrine is a rule of exclusion, in\nreality it is a rule of admission: what the advocate must really know\nis how to get the proffered hearsay admitted under one of the\nmultitude of exceptions to the nominal rule of exclusion (FRE 802).\nThus, the pertinent veritistic question concerns the veritistic\ncredentials of the grounds on which hearsay is admitted, rather than\nthe veritistic reasons for excluding it in most cases. (Such\nquestions, in fact, are already a staple of much evidence\nscholarship.)\n\nIn theory of adjudication, by contrast, the Normative Naturalist wants\nto identify norms for adjudication that will help judges realize\nadjudicative goals. Such norms must, once again, satisfy two\nnaturalistic constraints: first, they must, as a matter of empirical\nfact, be effective means to goals (\u201cthe Instrumental\nConstraint\u201d); second, they must be constrained by relevant\nempirical facts about the nature and limitations of judges (\u201cthe\nOught-Implies-Can Constraint\u201d) (Leiter 1998).\n\nDworkin\u2019s theory of adjudication (Dworkin 1986) makes a popular\ntarget for the Normative Naturalist. Dworkin\u2019s theory says, very\nroughly, that a judge should decide a case in such a way that it\ncoheres with the principle that explains some significant\nportion of the prior institutional history and provides the\nbest justification for that history as a matter of political\nmorality. Can a Normative Naturalist be a Dworkinian?\n\n(1) Instrumental Constraint: The naturalist assesses\nnormative advice relative to its actual effectiveness for realizing\nrelevant goals. What, then, is the relevant goal in\nadjudication? One candidate is surely this: we want to give\njudges normative advice that will lead them to reach fair or just\noutcomes. Thus, the naturalist\u2019s question becomes: which piece\nof normative advice is most effective in really helping\nactual judges realize justice and fairness? It is, at least, an open\nquestion whether Dworkin\u2019s methodology will be effective in\nleading judges to do fair things. The fact that his normative theory\nhas had almost no impact whatsoever on American judicial practice over\nthe last forty years is at least defeasible evidence that it does not\nappear to be an effective methodology (let alone one\neffective for realizing justice!) (Leiter 1998, p. 102). This latter\npoint is related to the naturalist\u2019s second, and more important,\nobjection.\n\n(2) Ought-Implies-Can-Constraint: One thing judges\ncannot do is what Dworkin\u2019s Judge Hercules does. This is a\nfamiliar complaint about Dworkin\u2019s theory, but naturalized\njurisprudence gives it a principled foundation. The naturalistic\njurisprudent eschews all normative guidance unusable by real judges;\nlike his naturalized counterpart in epistemology, he does \u201cnot\nwant to give merely idle advice, which humans [including judges] are\nincapable of following\u201d (Goldman 1978, p. 510). Dworkin may give\njudges an \u201caspirational model\u201d (to borrow Jules\nColeman\u2019s apt phrase), and the naturalistic jurisprudent need\nnot dispute that; but Descartes gave us an aspirational model in\nepistemology as well, and that does not make his program any more\nadequate or relevant by the naturalist\u2019s lights. (It\nwould be attractive if we could take certain \u201cclear and\ndistinct\u201d ideas, and build up all of knowledge from them.) The\nnaturalist wants normative advice effective for creatures like\nus; demanding of judges Herculean philosophical ingenuity\nviolates this constraint. Aspiration, the naturalist concludes, is not\na fit aim of normative advice, which must, first and foremost, offer\neffective means to ends.\n",
