    "main_text": "Materialism and The Early Program of the Institute of Social Research || Reason and Emancipation\n2.2 Reason and Emancipation\n\nWhen focusing on the affective nature of suffering, happiness, and\ncompassion in Horkheimer\u2019s view, one might get the sense that he\nis relying on a sort of emotivism that shuns reason. But there is a\nstrongly rationalistic strand present in Horkheimer\u2019s early work\nthat is tied directly to his views on positive social change. In fact,\nhe describes suffering as resulting from a lack of rational social\norganization, and proposes that any attempt to improve society must\ninvolve making it in some way more rational. This view is in turn tied\nto the broadly Marxian element in Horkheimer\u2019s early work, as\ncapitalism is criticized for creating the irrational social conditions\nthat lead to suffering.\n\nTo a large extent, this problem of irrationality is described as a\nsocial coordination problem. Insofar as it is individual human beings\nwho suffer, and who desire happiness, individual welfare is a crucial\nmatter. This is made clear by the critique of Hegelian\n\u201ctransfiguration,\u201d which is problematic partly because it\nsubsumes individual suffering and happiness within the absolute. At\nthe same time, individual welfare is still dependent upon a broader\nsocial basis, so the life of society as a whole is pertinent to the\nsearch for happiness. But capitalism has created a situation wherein\npeople are made to focus on their own individual welfare, without\nconsidering anything other than \u201cthe conservation and\nmultiplication of their own property\u201d (1933b, p. 19). Social\nneeds are thus handled through various disorganized activities focused\non individual needs, which in turn inadequately deals with the social\nbasis of individual welfare, thus detracting from individual welfare.\nThis kind of critique is found in some form in many of\nHorkheimer\u2019s early essays (see, for example, 1934c, pp.\n247\u2013250 and 1935b, pp. 162\u2013170).\n\nSuch an argument is made particularly clearly in \u201cMaterialism\nand Morality,\u201d where Horkheimer discusses idealist, and\npredominantly Kantian, conceptions of morality. One main thread of the\nrather intricate argument made there is that there is a tension in\nKant\u2019s view, insofar as he places a radical emphasis on the\nindividual will, but also makes that will beholden to the universal\nlaw described in terms of the kingdom of ends. This tension supposedly\ncomes from the bourgeois socio-economic context in which Kant\nlived:\n\nThe categorical imperative holds up a \u201cuniversal natural\nlaw,\u201d the law of human society, as a standard of comparison to\nthis [bourgeois] natural law of individuals. This would be meaningless\nif particular interests and the needs of the general public\nintersected not just haphazardly but of necessity. That this does not\noccur, however, is the inadequacy of the bourgeois economic form:\nthere exists no rational connection between the free competition of\nindividuals as what mediates and the existence of the entire society\nas what is mediated...This irrationality expresses itself in the\nsuffering of the majority of human beings...This problem, which only\nsociety itself could rationally solve through the systematic\nincorporation of each member into a consciously directed labor\nprocess, manifests itself in the bourgeois epoch as a conflict in the\ninner life of its subjects. (pp. 19\u201320)\n\n\nThis passage makes it clear that the coordination problems associated\nwith the \u201cbourgeois epoch\u201d (i.e. the capitalist period)\nare problems of irrationality. Furthermore, it makes clear that the\nsolution to these problems is to be found in the formation of a more\nrational social order, which is described in terms of a socialist\nplanned economy. This point, then, provides the space where Horkheimer\ncan link his own materialist theory, and the work of the Institute, to\nthe broadly Marxian aim of emancipation through overcoming the\ncapitalist order. Because \u201cthe wretchedness of our own time is\nconnected with the structure of society\u201d (1933b, 24) a social\ntheory that could make that structure\u2019s irrationality explicit\ncould help overcome that wretchedness. Furthermore, that irrationality\nneeds to be made explicit to the classes who suffer the most from it,\nso they can take proper action. So Horkheimer\u2019s view connects\ngenerally to the Marxian view of the proletariat as a critical force\nin history, but unlike (on certain interpretations, at least) Marx, he\ndoes not see history as necessarily moving the proletariat to\n\u201ccritical consciousness\u201d because of the irrationality\ninherent in capitalist socio-economic arrangements. Rather, various\nsocial and economic forces keep the proletariat from recognizing its\npotential; for example there is a split between the unemployed, who\nsuffer most from capitalism but are disorganized, and the workers who\ncan be organized, but fear losing their jobs (Horkheimer 1934a,\n61\u201365). The proletariat requires the help of the theorist. That\ntheorist must engage in a special kind of activity, however, which (as\nthe next section will show) must steer clear of two opposing\nerrors.\n",
