    "main_text": "Philosophical Method\n2. Philosophical Method\n\nChisholm wrote and taught in a distinctive style that inspired his\nreaders and students. His characteristic methodology was to begin his\ndiscussion of a philosophical issue by identifying a few key questions\nand citing pre-analytic data that an adequate theory should\naccommodate. In many cases his work began in the Aristotelian fashion\nwith a set of \u201caporia\u201d or puzzles. He sought to develop a\ntheory that would be adequate to the puzzles. He formulated his\ntheories by first introducing a small number of primitive or\nunanalyzed terms and then constructing an often elaborate system of\ndefinitions and principles all built on these primitives. The final\nprinciples and definitions were intended to provide the basis for\nsolutions to the puzzles with which he began. The clarity and elegance\nof the systems were remarkable, though in some cases critics worried\nthat the primitive concepts were for one reason or another suspect.\nChisholm encouraged readers and students to criticize his systems by\nproposing counterexamples and objections. They were eager to do so,\nand Chisholm took great joy in revising and improving upon his views\nin the light of their comments.\n\nChisholm was well known for his penchant for formulating definitions\nand subsequently revising them in the light of counterexamples. The\nauthors of the Philosophical Lexicon (see Other Internet\nResources) took note of this and accordingly introduced a new\ntechnical term of their own:\n\nchisholm, v. To make repeated small alterations in a\ndefinition or example. \u201cHe started with definition (d.8) and\nkept chisholming away at it until he ended up with\n(d.8\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032).\u201d\n\n",
