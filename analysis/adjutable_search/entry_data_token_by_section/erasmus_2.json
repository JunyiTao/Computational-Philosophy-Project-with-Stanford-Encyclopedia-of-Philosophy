    "main_text": "Educational Philosophy\n3. Educational Philosophy\n\nErasmus earned his living as a teacher for only a few years, but\neducation remained a lifelong interest and a central theme in his\nwritings (see especially Margolin 1995). Erasmus expressed confidence\nin the potential of human beings for self-improvement, a corollary of\nhis acceptance of free will. He believed in the preponderance of\nnurture over nature, given the power of the will. It was therefore the\nduty of parents and teachers to ensure that children fulfilled their\npotential and of adults to live up to it. \u201cWhat is man\u2019s\nreal nature?\u201d Erasmus asks.\n\n\nIs it not to live according to reason? This is why he is called a\nrational being, and this is what sets him apart from animals. And what\nis the most harmful influence upon man? Surely it is ignorance. (CWE\n26: 312)\n\n\nCiting Origen, Erasmus speaks of a tripartite human nature, made up of\nspirit, soul, and flesh. The soul, which is \u201cthe middle\npart\u201d, may through free will align itself either with the divine\nspirit and \u201citself become spiritual, but if it abandons itself\nto the cupidities of the flesh, it will degenerate into the\nbody\u201d (CWE 66: 51). This is a characteristic humanistic position\nand recalls the wording of Pico della Mirandola\u2019s iconic\nOration on the Dignity of Man (1496 [1996], 8), which\ndescribes the choice as one between \u201cdescend[ing] to the lower,\nbrutish forms of life\u2026[or] ris[ing] again to the superior\norders whose life is divine\u201d.\n\nErasmus accepted the classical doctrine of the three prerequisites of\nexcellence\u2014natural talent, instruction, and practice (CWE 26:\n311)\u2014but he tended to blame a poor result on neglect and wrong\nteaching methods rather than a lack of ability or intention on the\npart of student. This parallels the Catholic belief in the limited\npower of free will. Without divine guidance human endeavours are in\nvain. Similarly the successful education of children depends on the\nguidance of parents and teachers, father figures recalling God\u2019s\npatriarchal model.\n\nErasmus composed a number of treatises on the subject of education. He\ndiscussed curriculum in two works, De Ratione Studii (On the\nMethod of Study, 1511) and Ratio Verae Theologiae (Method of\nTrue Theology, 1518). In both tracts he emphasized the importance of\nlearning the classical languages and studying the classics. In the\ncase of secular education, he counseled early exposure of students to\nGreek and Latin and extensive reading in probati autores (the\napproved canon of authors), like Homer, Terence, Plautus, Virgil,\nHorace, and Cicero. He recommended an all-round education but\nemphasized the study of history, the proverbial teacher of life.\nSimilarly, he counseled theology students to read the\n\u201cclassics\u201d, that is, the sources of Christianity: the\nBible and the Church Fathers. In contrast to the scholastics, whose\ncore subject was dialectic, Erasmus privileged ethics over logic and\nthe formation of character over factual knowledge.\n\nHis ideas on the aims and methods of education are contained in De\nPueris Instituendis (On the Education of Children, 1529) and\nInstitutio Principis Christiani (On the Education of a\nChristian Prince, 1516), but are expressed there in a rhetorical\nrather than a systematic fashion. Erasmus himself calls On the\nEducation of Children a demonstration of rhetorical principles,\nan example of a theme \u201cpresented first in brief summary form and\nthen developed into a more elaborate and more detailed argument\u201d\n(CWE 26: 295). The rhetorical nature of the Education of a\nChristian Prince is self-evident. It is hardly more than a\ncollection of aphorisms, a showcase for Erasmus\u2019 rhetorical\nskills rather than an expression of personal opinions. This creates a\nproblem of interpretation for the modern reader. To separate\nclich\u00e9s from principles it is necessary to consider the\nfrequency and consistency of certain thought patterns in\nErasmus\u2019 works. Four ideas are recurring themes in his writings\non education: the humanizing effect of education; the effectiveness of\ncooperative rather than coercive methods; the ability of both sexes to\nbenefit from education, and the importance of internalizing the\nmaterial taught.\n\nHe proclaimed that human beings without education had no humanity:\n\u201cMan was not born but made man\u201d (CWE 26: 304). It was\neducation that raised human beings above the level of brute beasts and\nmade them useful members of society. \u201cMan, unless he has\nexperienced the influence of learning and philosophy, is at the mercy\nof impulses that are worse than those of a wild beast\u201d (CWE 26:\n305). Education is an important socializing process. A child that has\nbeen well educated will grow up \u201ca son who will be a faithful\nprotector of his family, a good husband to his wife, and a solid and\nuseful citizen of his country\u201d (CWE 26: 302). There are\nimmediate practical advantages to schooling as well.\n\n\nBeing occupied with his studies, a child will avoid the common\npitfalls of youth\u2014for learning is something that engages the\nentire person- and this is a blessing which should not be undervalued.\n(CWE 26: 297)\n\n\nTeachers must understand that education will bear fruit only if it is\na cooperative effort. It is the teacher\u2019s task to present the\nmaterial in an instructive and entertaining fashion to retain the\nstudent\u2019s interest rather than use punitive methods. Coercion\nand corporal punishment are counter-productive, whereas an appeal to\nthe students\u2019 interests and praise for their effort are\neffective means of education.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Erasmus grew up in the belief that\nwomen were intellectually inferior to men and therefore could not\nbenefit from education in the same measure. He changed his mind after\nmeeting the erudite daughters of Thomas More and hearing of learned\nwomen like Marguerite of Navarre and Caritas Pickheimer. Several of\nhis Colloquies, notably \u201cThe Abbot and the Learned\nLady\u201d and \u201cThe New Mother\u201d, acknowledge the\nintellectual aspirations of women (and in a winking manner, their\noccasional superiority to men).\n\nIn Erasmus\u2019 time memorization and imitation were the predominant\nmethods of education. Anticipating modern principles, Erasmus\nemphasized the importance of understanding and internalizing the\nmaterial presented. This approach is examined at length in his\ntreatise Ciceronianus (The Ciceronian, 1528), which deals\nwith the imitation of Cicero\u2019s style, a subject of burning\ninterest to Erasmus\u2019 contemporaries (excellent analysis in\nChomarat 1981, 815\u2013840). He emphasizes the importance of\naptum et decorum in compositions, that is, the\nappropriateness of arguments to time, place, and audience. This cannot\nbe achieved by a slavish imitation of classical models. It requires a\nsolid understanding of the rules underpinning style, which in turn\nwill allow a creative reworking of the original to meet the\nrequirements of the writer\u2019s own circumstances.\n\n\nImitation does not immediately incorporate into its own speech any\nnice little feature it comes across, but transmits it to the mind for\ninward digestion, so that becoming part of our own system, it gives\nthe impression not of something begged from someone else, but of\nsomething that springs from our own mental processes. (CWE 28:\n441)\n\n\nThe gist of Erasmus\u2019 arguments about imitation is drawn from\nclassical handbooks of rhetoric, such as Quintilian\u2019s\nInstitutio Oratoria or Cicero\u2019s Ad Herennium,\nbut Erasmus goes further, giving a Christian context to the classical\nprecepts. To satisfy the requirements of aptum et decorum, a\nChristian\u2019s speech must savor of Christ, \u201cor you will turn\nout not Ciceronian but pagan\u201d. Indeed, this was the purpose of\nall education, \u201cof studying philosophy, of studying eloquence,\nto know Christ, to celebrate the glory of Christ. This is the goal of\nall learning and all eloquence\u201d (CWE 28: 447)\n",
