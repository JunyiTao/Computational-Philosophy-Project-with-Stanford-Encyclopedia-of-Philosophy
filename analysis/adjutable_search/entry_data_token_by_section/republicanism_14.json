    "main_text": "The Contemporary Republican Program || Civic virtue and corruption\n4.3 Civic virtue and corruption\n\nAmong the more salient themes in the classical republican tradition\nare the importance of civic virtue and the dangers of corruption. We\nmay understand the term \u2018corruption\u2019 simply to mean the\nadvancement of personal or sectional interest at the expense of the\npublic good, and \u2018civic virtue\u2019 as its opposite\u2014that\nis, a willingness to do one\u2019s part in supporting the public\ngood. Critics of republicanism often fear that this implies extensive\nself-sacrifice and frugality, a renunciation of individuality and\nself-identification with the community (Herzog 1986; Goodin 2003;\nBrennan and Lomasky 2006). These fears are no doubt encouraged by the\ncivic humanist reading of the classical tradition along perfectionist\nlines. Civic republicans accordingly have been at pains to show the\ncontrary\u2014that civic virtue should be understood as a strictly\ninstrumental good, useful in establishing and maintaining republican\nliberty. Far from calling for the subjection of individual to\ncollective aims, they argue, republican liberty is desirable in part\nbecause it enables citizens to pursue their private aims with\nassurances of security (Skinner 1984, 1991; Spitz 1993; Dagger 1997;\nViroli 2002; Maynor 2003).\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two topics to consider under the heading\nof civic virtue. On the one hand, there is the civic virtue and danger\nof its corruption on the part of public officials; on the other, there\nis the civic virtue and danger of its corruption on the part of\ncitizens in general. With respect to the former, republicans typically\nreject the view (common in the liberal tradition) that public\nofficials are by nature corrupt, and instead regard individuals as\npotentially corruptible, but not necessarily corrupt (Pettit 1997).\nWorking from this assumption, it is strictly a pragmatic and empirical\nquestion which configurations of public laws, institutions, and norms\nare most likely to minimize the danger of corruption, and enhance the\ncivic virtue of public officials. Options here include screening\nprocedures on the selection of officials, rules and norms keeping some\npolicy options out of bounds, and both positive and negative\nsanctions. In designing such institutions, it is important not to\nassume the worst of people, for otherwise we might inadvertently\nencourage (through an evident lack of trust) the very corrupt behavior\none aims to guard against.\n\nPromoting civic virtue on the part of the citizens in general,\nhowever, is just as important from a republican point of view. There\nare a variety of possible reasons for this. For the most part, they\nstem from the observation that the widespread enjoyment of republican\nliberty is most likely to be maximized in a community where the\ncitizens are committed to that ideal, and each is willing to do his or\nher part in realizing it. For example, through collective political\naction, citizens can bring instances of domination to public\nattention; they can support laws and policies that would expand\nrepublican freedom; and they can do their part in defending republican\ninstitutions when called upon to do so. Promoting this sort of\ncommitment to republican ideals will require a fairly robust program\nof civics education, together with a culture that rewards virtue with\npublic esteem (Dagger 1997; Pettit 1997; Brennan and Pettit 2003;\nMaynor 2003; Costa 2009; Lovett 2020). Again, it should be emphasized\nhere that citizens do not enjoy republican freedom, on the civic\nrepublican view, in being virtuous. Indeed, this could not be\nthe case since, as argued earlier, the degree of republican freedom\nenjoyed is rather a question of how the laws, institutions, and norms\nof the community are ordered. Civic virtue is, however,\ninstrumentally useful both in bringing about the right sorts\nof laws, institutions, and norms, and in ensuring their durability and\nreliability.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning the connection between civic virtue\n(both on the part of public officials and citizens in general) and the\nrule of law. The significance of the rule of law for republican\nliberty was discussed above; in the classical republican tradition,\nthis was expressed as the \u201cempire of law\u201d ideal\u2014the\nnotion that in a free republic laws, not men, rule. Of course this\ncannot ever be literally true, but it can be approximated in a sort of\nartificial way, so that life can be experienced as if it were\ntrue within a given community. This requires, however, that the law be\nwidely regarded as clear, predictable, and legitimate, and this in\nturn is possible only when there is a generally high level of\ncompliance and when legal rules are embedded in a shared network of\ninformal social norms (Pettit 1997; Lovett 2016a).\n4.4 Republicanism Across Borders\n\nThe classical republicans were fond of extolling the martial valor of\nRome and other ancient republics, and they often followed Machiavelli\nin advocating policies and institutions that would enhance the\nexpansionist capacities of republics. For this they have often been\naccused of militaristic and imperialistic tendencies (see for example\nGoodin 2003), but this is not entirely fair. One has to be mindful of\nthe dangerous security environments republics have often faced. The\nclassical republicans rarely advocated conquest for its own sake:\n\u201cswords were given to men,\u201d writes Sidney, \u201cthat\nnone might be slaves,\u201d not that they might enslave others (1698,\n343). In a hostile world populated by autocratic rivals, Machiavelli\nmay have been right to believe that a republic\u2019s best defence is\na good offense.\n\nEven so, the classical republicans were sensitive to the particular\ndangers of territorial expansion. They especially worried that by\nupsetting the domestic balance of wealth and power, imperial conquest\nwould undermine freedom at home, and accordingly they sought remedies\nthrough various cooperative and federal arrangements (Deudney 2007;\nBohman 2008). Whether optimally securing republican freedom under\nmodern conditions will ultimately require some sort of global\nrepublic, however, remains a topic of debate (see Pettit 2010;\nMart\u00ed 2010; Maynor 2015).\n\nBeyond narrow security concerns, however, contemporary civic\nrepublicans have recently begun to explore the implications of\nrepublican freedom for global economic justice. Supposing the ideal is\nsuitably universalized, and thus every human being\u2019s\nnon-domination counts the same, are republicans committed to\ncosmopolitan policies of global redistribution? Here a wide range of\nviews can be found in the literature. Pettit (2010, 2014) argues no,\non the grounds that economic justice is mainly important indirectly\nfor preserving domestic republican institutions, whereas Lovett\n(2016b) argues yes, on the grounds that poverty and severe inequality\ndirectly expose individuals to domination. In between these positions,\nLaborde (2010), and Laborde and Ronzoni (2016) maintain that our\nglobal obligations to promote non-domination are similar but\nultimately weaker than our domestic ones. Finally, Bachvarova (2013)\nsuggests that republicanism is best suited to address relational\nrather than distributive global justice.\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge to contemporary civic republican\ntheory, however, is the problem of state borders and global migration.\nRepublicans are in a strong position to advocate for stateless\npersons, refugees, and resident non-citizens who, in various ways, are\nclearly vulnerable to avoidable domination (Bohman 2009; Benton 2010).\nMuch less obvious, however, is how to address the issue of\ninternational freedom of movement. Traditionally committed to a strong\nconception of citizenship, the republican ideal of political liberty\nhas often seemed inseparable from the existence of bounded communities\nof fellow free citizens. Pettit (2012, 161\u20132) claims that since\nstates have no choice but to maintain borders, the existence of\nmigration controls as such cannot count as dominating, while Costa\n(2016) disagrees. Honohan (2014) insists that any migration controls a\ngiven state does implement should be non-arbitrary, but as Fine (2014)\nobserves, this does not settle the ultimate question of whether\nfreedom of movement can be reconciled with the need to maintain civic\ncommunity.\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn many respects, civic republicanism remains a still underdeveloped\npolitical doctrine. Further work is required in all the areas\ndiscussed above, and there are many issues central to the concerns of\ncontemporary political theorists and philosophers that contemporary\ncivic republicans have only recently begun to examine. Among the\nlatter, there are now at least initial treatments of multiculturalism\n(Laborde 2008; Lovett 2010; Honohan 2013; Bachvarova 2014), education\npolicy (Peterson 2011; Hinchliffe 2014; Macleod 2015), and\nintergenerational justice (Beckman 2016; Katz 2017; Pinto 2019),\nalthough substantial work certainly remains to be done. Nevertheless,\ncivic republicanism is a dynamic and growing field, which stands to\nmake continuing positive contributions to debate in contemporary\nsocial and political theory.",
