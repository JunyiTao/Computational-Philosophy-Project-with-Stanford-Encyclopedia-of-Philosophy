    "main_text": "Saving the Thesis: Alternative Conceptions of Chance and Randomness || Product Chance\n6.1 Product Chance\n\n\nThe frequency theory is a product conception of chance. An\noutcome-type has a chance, according to von Mises (1957), just in case\nit is part of a random sequence of outcomes in which that outcome type\nhas a robust limit relative frequency. So chance can\u2019t be separated\nfrom randomness; it in fact requires randomness. Moreover, since having\na limit relative frequency of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is a measure one property of infinite\nbinary sequences, all random sequences define collectives. (Those\ninfinite binary sequences which do not converge on a limit frequency\nare non-random.) Yet the problems with frequentism as a theory of\nchance are well known (H\u00e1jek, 1997; 2009; Jeffrey,\n1977)\u2014we have come across some of them above\u2014and to save\nRCT at the price of accepting frequentism has not attracted many.\n\n\nBut the prospects are more promising for Humean views of chance\n(Lewis 1994; Loewer 2004), like the reductionist views discussed in\nsupplements\n A.1,\n A.3,\n and\n D.\n These are a species of product\nconception of chance, for a possible world will not feature chances\nunless the best (simplest, best fitting, and most informative)\ndescription of what events occur in that world involves a probability\nfunction. Two worlds couldn\u2019t differ in their chances without differing\nalso somewhere in the events which occur. Chance thus supervenes on the\nactual outcomes in a given world, but not necessarily in a direct\nway\u2014in the service of simplicity, some deviation from the actual\nfrequency values may yield a description that is better overall. There\nis considerable debate over whether a Humean best systems account can\nexplain all of the things we know about chance. Lewis thought that\nchance was the \u2018big bad bug\u2019 for his broadly Humean world\nview (though he thought that the NP, discussed in supplement\n A.1,\n debugged Humean Supervenience:\nLewis 1994), and there has been considerable debate over whether or not\nthe PP or the BCP can be accounted for by the Humean, as the references\nin the\n supplement A\n attest. Moreover, there\nare problems about whether the notion of a probability distribution\n\u2018fitting\u2019 a set of outcomes makes sense (Elga 2004). But\nsuppose a best systems account can be made to work.\n\n\nThe role of simplicity in Humean views is important for randomness.\nFor if a world contains a genuinely random sequence of outcomes, there\nwill be no short description of that sequence. Those descriptions which\ndo not attempt to describe what happens in all its particularity, but\ninstead involve a probability distribution that makes the sequence a\ntypical one with respect to that probability function, will be less\ninformative but much shorter, and still fit just as well. So it seems\nthat if a world contains a random sequence of outcomes, the best theory\nwill be one which involves probabilities, and in virtue of being part\nof the best theory, those probabilities will be chances. That makes the\nright to left direction of RCT plausible. The other direction would\nhold if this route through simplicity was the only way in which chances\ncould enter into the best system. Could there be a world with chances\nin which there was no random sequence? Here things are rather murkier\nfor the Humean. For the hallmark of the best systems approach to chance\nis that, by involving simplicity, it avoids some of the problems for\npure frequentism. In particular, an unrepresentative outcome sequence\n(a short one, or highly biased one) need not force the chances to take\nthe value of the actual frequencies. Suppose a world contains two\nintrinsic duplicate coins, one of which is tossed many times, landing\nheads about half the time; the other is tossed few times and lands\ntails every time. The second coin\u2019s outcome sequence has a heads\nfrequency of zero. It is a strength of the best systems account that we\nmay still say the chance of heads was \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), because the coin is embedded\nin a world where another, similar, coin did have the appropriate\noutcome frequencies, and it is overall a simpler theory to say that\nboth of these coins obeyed the same probabilistic laws than that the\nsecond one was an oasis of determinism. But this case provides a\nproblem for RCT\u2014it looks like the second coin toss is not part of\nany random sequence of outcomes (since a few all tails tosses is not\nrandom), but it has a chance.\n\n\nWe should not let even the partial success of best systems analysis\nin preserving RCT sway us. The Humean account of chance is perfectly\ncompatible with the existence of bias and with non-independent\nsequences of trials; RCT is not. The problem just mentioned arises even\nin the best circumstances for RCT, where there is at least one actual\nunbiased fair coin sequence. The existence of such a problem could have\nbeen predicted. The best systems account deviates from pure frequentism\nprecisely in trying to accommodate the single-case process intuitions\nthat, as we saw in\n \u00a71,\n characterise chance. Every\nsuccess in this direction brings this broadly product conception of\nchance closer to a process conception, and will therefore be a\npotential opportunity for counterexamples to RCT to emerge.\n",
