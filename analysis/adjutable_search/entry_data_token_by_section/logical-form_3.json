    "main_text": "Frege and Formal Language\n4. Frege and Formal Language\n\nGottlob Frege\n showed how to resolve these difficulties for classical logic in one\nfell swoop. His system of logic, published in 1879 and still in use\n(with notational modifications), was arguably the single greatest\ncontribution to the subject. So it is significant that on\nFrege\u2019s view, propositions do not have subject-predicate form.\nIndeed, his leading idea was that propositions have\n\u201cfunction-argument\u201d structure. Frege thereby drew a\nsubstantial distinction between logical form and grammatical form as\ntraditionally conceived. This had a major impact on subsequent\ndiscussions of thought and its relation to language. Though before\nturning to details, it is worth taking a slight detour to note that\nFrege did not think of functions as abstract objects like\nnumbers.\n\nEvery function maps each entity in some domain onto exactly one entity\nin some range. But while every function thus determines a set of\nordered pairs, Frege (1891) did not identify functions with such sets.\nHe said that a function \u201cby itself must be called incomplete, in\nneed of supplementation, or unsaturated. And in this respect functions\ndiffer fundamentally from numbers (p. 133).\u201d For example, we can\nrepresent the successor function as follows, with the natural numbers\nas the relevant domain for the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019: \\(S(x) = x + 1\\).\nThis function maps zero onto one, one onto two, and so on. So we can\nspecify the set \\(\\{\\langle x, y \\rangle : y = x + 1\\}\\) as the\n\u201cvalue-range\u201d of the successor function. But according to\nFrege, any particular argument (e.g., the number one) \u201cgoes\ntogether with the function to make up a complete whole\u201d (e.g.,\nthe number two); and a number does not go together with a set to form\na unit in this fashion. Frege granted that the word\n\u2018function\u2019 is often used to talk about the sets he would\ncall value-ranges. But he maintained that the notion of an\n\u201cunsaturated\u201d function, which may be applied to endlessly\nmany arguments, is logically prior to any notion of a set with\nendlessly many elements that are specified functionally; see p.135,\nnote E. While the second positive integer is the successor of the\nfirst, the number two is still a single thing, distinct from any\ncombination of a number with a set. Frege was influenced by\n Kant\u2019s discussion of judgment,\n the kind of unity that a\n (structured) proposition\n exhibits, and the ancient observation that merely combining two\nthings (e.g., Socrates and the property of being mortal) does not make\nthe combination true or false. If it helps, think about\n\u2018\\(S(x)\\)\u2019\u2014or better, \u2018\\(S(\\ )\\)\u2019\u2014as the\nunsaturated result of abstracting away from the numerical argument in\na complex denoting expression like \u2018\\(S(1)\\)\u2019 or\n\u2018\\(S(62)\\)\u2019; and think about saturating \u2018\\(S(\\ )\\)\u2019\nwith a numerical argument, like \u20181\u2019 or \u201862\u2019,\nas a process of \u201cde-abstraction.\u201d So in saying that\npropositions have \u201cfunction-argument\u201d structure, Frege was\nnot only rejecting the traditional idea that logical from reflects the\nsubject-predicate structure of ordinary sentences, he was suggesting\nthat propositions (and any of their complex constituents) exhibit a\nkind of unity that is like the unity of \u2018\\(S(1)\\)\u2019, which can\nappear in invented arithmetic sentences like \u2018\\(S(1) = 2\\)\u2019.\nChurch (1941) echoed Frege by distinguishing functions-in-intension,\nwhich Church identified with computational procedures, from their\nextensions. Perhaps Frege would have said that even procedures, as\nabstractions of a special kind, are too object-like to be functions in\nhis special sense. But distinct procedures can determine the same\nextension. (Compare adding one to a natural number n with the\nfollowing procedure: take the positive square root of the result of\nadding one to n squared plus n doubled.) So at least\nin this sense, functions-in-intension can be distinguished from the\nextensions they determine; cp. Chomsky\u2019s (1986) contrast between\nI-languages and E-languages.\n\nFor purposes of capturing valid arguments concerning relations, the\nmore important point is that functions need not be unary. For example,\narithmetic division can be represented as a function from ordered\npairs of numbers onto quotients: \\(Q(x, y) = \\frac{x}{y}\\). Mappings can also be\nconditional. Consider the function that maps every even integer onto\nitself, and every odd integer onto its successor: \\(C(x) = x\\) if \\(x\\) is\neven, and \\(x + 1\\) otherwise; \\(C(1) = 2\\), \\(C(2) = 2\\), \\(C(3) = 4\\), etc. Frege\nheld that propositions have parts that correspond to functions, and in\nparticular, conditional functions that map arguments onto special\nvalues that reflect the truth or falsity of propositions/sentences.\n(As discussed below, Frege [1892] also distinguished these\n\u201ctruth values\u201d from what he called Thoughts [Gedanken] or\nthe \u201csenses\u201d [Sinnen] of propositions; where each of these\nsentential senses \u201cpresents\u201d a truth value in certain\nway\u2014i.e., as the value of a certain indicated function given a\ncertain indicated argument.)\n\nVariable letters, such as \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(y\\)\u2019 in\n\u2018\\(Q(x, y) = \\frac{x}{y}\\)\u2019, are typographically convenient for\nrepresenting functions that take more than one argument. But we could\nalso index argument places, as shown below.\n\n\\[\nQ[(\\ )_i, (\\ )_j] = \\frac{(\\ )_i}{(\\ )_j}\n\\]\n\n\nOr we could replace the subscripts above with lines that connect each\npair of round brackets on the left of \u2018\\(=\\)\u2019 to a\ncorresponding pair of brackets on the right. But the idea, however we\nencode it, is that a proposition has at least one constituent that is\nsaturated by the requisite number of arguments.\n\nOn Frege\u2019s view, the proposition that Mary sang has a functional\ncomponent corresponding to \u2018sang\u2019 and an argument\ncorresponding to \u2018Mary\u2019, even if the English sentence\n\u2018Mary sang\u2019 has \u2018Mary\u2019 as its subject and\n\u2018sang\u2019 as its predicate. The proposition can be\nrepresented as follows: \\(\\textrm{Sang}(\\textrm{Mary})\\). Frege thought of the relevant\nfunction as a conditional mapping from individuals to truth values:\n\\(\\textrm{Sang}(x) = \\textbf{T}\\) if \\(x\\) sang, and \\(\\textbf{F}\\)\notherwise; where \u2018\\(\\textbf{T}\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\textbf{F}\\)\u2019 stand for special entities such that\nfor each individual \\(x\\), \\(\\textrm{Sang}(x) = \\textbf{T}\\) if and only if \\(x\\)\nsang, and \\(\\textrm{Sang}(x) = \\textbf{F}\\) if and only if \\(x\\) did not sing.\nAccording to Frege, the proposition that John admires Mary combines an\nordered pair of arguments with a functional component that corresponds\nto the transitive verb: \\(\\textrm{Admires}(\\textrm{John}, \\textrm{Mary})\\); where for any individual\n\\(x\\), and any individual \\(y\\), \\(\\textrm{Admires}(x, y) = \\textbf{T}\\) if \\(x\\)\nadmires \\(y\\), and \\(\\textbf{F}\\) otherwise. From this perspective,\nthe structure and constituents are the same in the proposition that\nMary is admired by John, even though \u2018Mary\u2019 is the\ngrammatical subject of the passive sentence. Likewise, Frege did not\ndistinguish the proposition that three precedes four from the\nproposition that four is preceded by three. More importantly,\nFrege\u2019s treatment of quantified propositions departs radically\nfrom the traditional idea that the grammatical structure of sentence\nreflects the logical structure of the indicated proposition.\n\nIf \\(S\\) is the function corresponding to \u2018sang\u2019, then Mary\nsang iff\u2014i.e., if and only if\u2014\\(S(\\textrm{Mary}) =\n\\textbf{T}\\). Likewise, someone sang iff: \\(S\\) maps some individual\nonto \\(\\textbf{T}\\); that is, for some individual \\(x\\), \\(S(x) =\n\\textbf{T}\\). Or using a modern variant of Frege\u2019s\noriginal notation, someone sang iff \\(\\exists x [S(x)]\\). The quantifier\n\u2018\\(\\exists x\\)\u2019 is said to bind the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019,\nwhich ranges over individual things in a domain of discourse. (For\nnow, assume that the domain contains only people.) If every individual\nin the domain sang, then \\(S\\) maps every individual onto the truth value\n\\(\\textbf{T}\\); or using formal notation, \\(\\forall x [S(x)]\\). A\nquantifier binds each occurrence of its variable, as in\n\u2018\\(\\exists x [P(x) \\land D(x)]\\)\u2019,\nwhich reflects the logical form of \u2018Someone is both a politician\nand deceitful\u2019. In this last example, the quantifier combines\nwith a complex functional component that is formed by conjoining two\nsimpler ones.\n\nWith regard to the proposition that some politician is deceitful,\ntraditional grammar suggests the division \u2018Some politician / is\ndeceitful\u2019, with the noun \u2018politician\u2019 combining\nwith the quantificational word to form a complex subject. But on a\nFregean view, grammar masks the logical division between the\nexistential quantifier and the rest: \\(\\exists x [P(x) \\land D(x)]\\). With\nregard to the proposition that every politician is deceitful, Frege\nalso stresses the logical division between the quantifier and its\nscope: \\(\\forall x [P(x) \\rightarrow D(x)]\\); every individual is deceitful if a\npolitician. Here too, the quantifier combines with a complex\nfunctional component, albeit one that is conditional rather than\nconjunctive. (The formal sentence \u2018\\(\\forall x [P(x) \\land D(x)]\\)\u2019\nimplies, unconditionally, that every individual is a\npolitician.) As Frege (1879) defined his analogs of the modern symbols\nused here, \u2018\\(P(x) \\rightarrow D(x)\\)\u2019 is equivalent to\n\u2018\\(\\lnot P(x) \\lor D(x)\\)\u2019, and\n\u2018\\(\\forall x\\)\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018\\(\\lnot \\exists\n\\lnot\\)\u2019. So \u2018\\(\\forall x [P(x) \\rightarrow D(x)]\\)\u2019\nis equivalent to \u2018\\(\\lnot \\exists x \\lnot\n[\\lnot P(x) \\lor D(x)]\\)\u2019; and given de Morgan\u2019s\nLaws (concerning the relations between negation, disjunction, and\nconjunction), \\(\\lnot \\exists x \\lnot [\\lnot P(x) \\lor D(x)]\\) iff\n\\(\\lnot \\exists x [P(x) \\land \\lnot D(x)]\\). Hence, \\(\\forall x [P(x)\n\\rightarrow D(x)]\\) iff \\(\\lnot \\exists x [P(x) \\land \\lnot\nD(x)]\\). This captures the idea that every politician is deceitful iff\nno individual is both a politician and not deceitful.\n\nIf this conception of logical form is correct, then grammar is\nmisleading in several respects. First, grammar leads us to think that\n\u2018some politician\u2019 indicates a constituent of the\nproposition that some politician is deceitful. Second, grammar masks a\ndifference between existential and universally quantified\npropositions; predicates are related conjunctively in the former, and\nconditionally in the latter. (Though as discussed in\n section seven,\n one can\u2014and Frege [1884] did\u2014adopt a different view that\nallows for relational/restricted quantifiers as in\n\u2018\\(\\forall x{:}P(x) [D(x)]\\)\u2019.)\n\nMore importantly, Frege\u2019s account was designed to apply equally\nwell to propositions involving relations and multiple quantifiers. And\nwith regard to these propositions, there seems to be a big difference\nbetween logical structure and grammatical structure.\n\nOn Frege\u2019s view, a single quantifier can bind an unsaturated\nposition that is associated with a function that takes a single\nargument. But it is equally true that two quantifiers can bind two\nunsaturated positions associated with a function that takes a pair of\narguments. For example, the proposition that everyone likes everyone\ncan be represented with the formal sentence\n\u2018\\(\\forall x \\forall y [L(x, y)]\\)\u2019. Assuming that\n\u2018Romeo\u2019 and \u2018Juliet\u2019 indicate arguments, it\nfollows that Romeo likes everyone, and that everyone likes\nJuliet\u2014\\(\\forall y [L(r, y)]\\) and \\(\\forall x [L(x, j)]\\). And it follows\nfrom all three propositions that Romeo likes Juliet: \\(L(r, j)\\). The\nrules of inference for Frege\u2019s logic capture this general\nfeature of the universal quantifier. A variable bound by a universal\nquantifier can be replaced with a name for some individual in the\ndomain. Correlatively, a name can be replaced with a variable bound by\nan existential quantifier. Given that Romeo likes Juliet, it follows\nthat someone likes Juliet, and Romeo likes someone. Frege\u2019s\nformalism can capture this as well: \\(L(r, j)\\); so \\(\\exists x [L(x, j)] \\land \\exists x [L(r, x)]\\).\nAnd given either conjunct in the conclusion,\nit follows that someone likes someone: \\(\\exists x \\exists y [L(x, y)]\\). A\nsingle quantifier can also bind multiple argument positions, as in\n\u2018\\(\\exists x [L(x, x)]\\)\u2019, which is true iff someone likes\nherself. Putting these points schematically:\n\\(\\forall x (\\dots x \\dots)\\), so \\(\\dots n \\dots\\); and\n\\(\\dots n \\dots\\), so \\(\\exists x (\\dots x \\dots)\\).\n\nMixed quantification introduces an interesting wrinkle. The\npropositions expressed with \u2018\\(\\exists x \\forall y [L(x, y)]\\)\u2019\nand \u2018\\(\\forall y \\exists x [L(x, y)]\\)\u2019 differ. We can paraphrase\nthe first as \u2018there is someone who likes everyone\u2019 and the\nsecond as \u2018everyone is liked by someone or other\u2019. The\nsecond follows from the first, but not vice versa. This suggests that\n\u2018someone likes everyone\u2019 is ambiguous, in that this string\nof English words can be used to express two different propositions.\nThis in turn raises difficult questions about what natural language\nexpressions are, and how they can be used to express propositions; see\n section eight.\n But for Frege, the important point concerned the distinction between\nthe propositions (Gedanken). Similar remarks apply to\n\u2018\\(\\forall x \\exists y [L(x, y)]\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\exists y \\forall x [L(x, y)]\\)\u2019.\n\nA related phenomenon is exhibited by \u2018John danced if Mary sang\nand Chris slept\u2019. Is the intended proposition of the form\n\u2018(A if B) and\nC\u2019 or \u2018A if\n(B and C)\u2019? Indeed, it seems\nthat the relation between word-strings and propositions expressed is\noften one-to-many. Is someone who says \u2018The artist drew a\nclub\u2019 talking about a sketch or a card game? One can use\n\u2018is\u2019 to express identity, as in \u2018Hesperus is the\nplanet Venus\u2019; but in \u2018Hesperus is bright\u2019,\n\u2018is\u2019 indicates predication. In \u2018Hesperus is a\nplanet\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 seems to be logically inert; yet in\n\u2018John saw a planet\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 seems to indicate\nexistential quantification: \\(\\exists x [P(x) \\land S(j, x)]\\). (One can\nrender \u2018Hesperus is a planet\u2019 as \u2018\\(\\exists x [P(x) \\land h = x]\\)\u2019.\nBut this treats \u2018is a planet\u2019 as\nimportantly different than \u2018is bright\u2019; and this leads to\nother difficulties.) According to Frege, such ambiguities provide\nfurther evidence that natural language is not suited to the task of\nrepresenting propositions and inferential relations perspicuously.\n(Leibniz and others had envisioned a \u201cCharacteristica\nUniversalis\u201d, but without detailed proposals for how to proceed\nbeyond syllogistic logic in creating one.) This is not to deny that\nnatural language is well suited for other purposes, perhaps including\nefficient human communication. And Frege held that we often do use\nnatural language to express propositions. But he suggested that\nnatural language is like the eye, whereas a good formal language is\nlike a microscope that reveals structure not otherwise observable. On\nthis view, the logical form of a proposition is made manifest by the\nstructure of a sentence in an ideal formal language\u2014what Frege\ncalled a Begriffsschrift (concept-script); where the sentences of such\na language exhibit function-argument structures that differ in kind\nfrom the grammatical structures exhibited by the sentences we use in\nordinary communication.\n\nThe real power of Frege\u2019s strategy for representing\npropositional structure is most evident in his discussions of proofs\nby induction, the Dedekind-Peano axioms for arithmetic, and how the\nproposition that every number has a successor is logically related to\nmore basic truths of arithmetic; see the entry on\n Frege\u2019s theorem and foundations for arithmetic.\n But without getting into these details, one can get a sense of\nFrege\u2019s improvement on previous logic by considering\n(15\u201316) and Fregean analyses of the corresponding\npropositions.\n\n(15)\nEvery patient respects some doctor\n\n\\(\\forall x \\{P(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y [D(y) \\land R(x,y)]\\}\\)\n(16)\nEvery old patient respects some doctor\n\n\\(\\forall x \\{[O(x) \\land P(x)] \\rightarrow \\exists y [D(y) \\land R(x,y)]\\}\\)\n\n\n\nSuppose that every individual has the following conditional property:\nif he\\(_x\\) is a patient, then some individual is such\nthat she\\(_y\\) is both a doctor and respected by\nhim\\(_x\\). Then it follows\u2014intuitively and given\nthe rules of Frege\u2019s logic\u2014that every\nindividual\\(_x\\) has the following conditional property:\nif he\\(_x\\) is both old and a patient, then some\nindividual\\(_y\\) is such that she\\(_y\\) is\nboth a doctor and respected by him\\(_x\\). So the\nproposition expressed with (16) follows from the one expressed with\n(15). More interestingly, we can also account for why the proposition\nexpressed with (14) follows from the one expressed with (13).\n\n(13)\nNo patient who saw every young doctor is healthy\n\n\\(\\neg \\exists x \\{P(x) \\land \\forall y \\{[Y(y) \\land D(y)] \\rightarrow S(x,y)\\} \\land H(x)\\}\\)\n\n(14)\nNo patient who saw every doctor is healthy\n\n\\(\\neg \\exists x \\{P(x) \\land \\forall y [D(y) \\rightarrow S(x,y)] \\land H(x)\\}\\)\n\n\nFor suppose it is false that some individual has the following\nconjunctive property: he\\(x\\) is a patient; and\nhe\\(x\\) saw every young doctor (i.e., every\nindividual\\(y\\) is such that if she\\(y\\)\nis a young doctor, then he\\(x\\) saw\nher\\(y\\)); and he\\(x\\) is healthy. Then\nintuitively, and also given the rules of Frege\u2019s logic, it is\nfalse that some individual has the following conjunctive property:\nhe\\(x\\) is a patient; and he\\(x\\) saw\nevery doctor; and he\\(x\\) is healthy. This captures the\nfact that the direction of valid inference is from \u2018every young\ndoctor\u2019 in (13) to \u2018every doctor\u2019 in (14), despite\nthe fact that in simpler cases, replacing \u2018every doctor\u2019\nwith \u2018every young doctor\u2019 is valid. More generally,\nFrege\u2019s logic handles a wide range of inferences that had\npuzzled medieval logicians. But the Fregean logical forms seem to\ndiffer dramatically from the grammatical forms of sentences like\n(13\u201316). Frege concluded that we need a Begriffsschrift,\ndistinct from the languages we naturally speak, to depict (and help us\ndiscern) the structures of the propositions we can somehow express by\nusing ordinary sentences in contexts.\n\nFrege also made a different kind of contribution, which would prove\nimportant, to the study of propositions. In early work, he spoke as\nthough propositional constituents were the relevant functions and\n(ordered n-tuples of) entities that such functions map to\ntruth-values. But he later refined this view in light of his\ndistinction between Sinn and Bedeutung; see the entry on\n Frege.\n The Sinn of an expression was said to be a \u201cway of\npresenting\u201d the corresponding Bedeutung, which might be an\nentity (with\u00a0truth-values as\u00a0special cases of\nentities)\u00a0or a function from (ordered n-tuples of) entities to\ntruth-values. The basic idea is that two names, like\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019, can present the\nsame Bedeutung in different ways; in which case, the Sinn of the first\nname differs from the Sinn of the second. Given this distinction, we\ncan think of \u2018Hesperus\u2019 as an expression that presents\nVenus as the evening star, while \u2018Phosphorus\u2019\npresents Venus as the morning star. Likewise, we can think of\n\u2018is bright\u2019 as an expression that presents a certain\nfunction in a certain way, and \u2018Hesperus is bright\u2019 as a\nsentence that presents its truth-value in a certain way\u2014i.e., as\nthe value of the function in question given the argument in question.\nFrom this perspective, propositions are sentential ways of presenting\ntruth-values, and proposition-parts are subsentential ways of\npresenting functions and arguments. Frege could thus distinguish the\nproposition that Hesperus is bright from the proposition that\nPhosphorus is bright, even though the two propositions are alike with\nregard to the relevant function and argument. Likewise, he could\ndistinguish the trivial proposition Hesperus is Hesperus from the\n(apparently nontrivial) proposition Hesperus is Phosphorus. This is an\nattractive view. For intuitively, the inference \u2018Hesperus is\nHesperus, so Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019 is not an instance of the\nfollowing obviously valid schema: A, so\nA. But this raised questions about what the Sinn of\nan expression really is, what \u201cpresentation\u201d could amount\nto, and what to say about a name with no Bedeutung.\n",
