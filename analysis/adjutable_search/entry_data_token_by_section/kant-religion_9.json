    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Religion during the Critical Period || Kant as Philosophical Theologian\n3.6 Kant as Philosophical Theologian\n\nIn October 1794, Kant received a royal rescript from the court of\nFrederick William II reprimanding him for his heterodox writings on\nChristianity and prohibiting him from further publication which\n\u201cdistort and disparage\u201d Christianity (cf. AK 7:6\n[1798]). In his official response (unknown date, but late October 1794\nis most likely), Kant agreed to \u201chereafter refrain altogether\nfrom discoursing publicly, in lectures or writing, on religion,\u201d\nbut also protested that his writings nevertheless have made\n\u201cno appraisal of Christianity\u201d (AK 7:8\n[1798]).\n\nPutting aside the question as to whether Kant might have prevaricated\nin his response, the question remains: to what extent does Kant engage\nwith Christian doctrine and to what extent is his philosophical\ntheology compatible with it? On the one hand, there are\nepistemological questions which we have addressed elsewhere in this\nentry. But there is also the question of whether or not Kant saw his\nwork as compatible or at odds with such core Christian doctrines as\nOriginal Sin, Grace, the Incarnation, and Vicarious Atonement. We will\nhere consider four interpretative positions.\n3.6.1 A successful Christian apologist\n\nSome interpreters have claimed that the Religion serves as\nKant\u2019s philosophical defense of traditional Christian doctrines,\nand that it succeeds in this regard. This is a view advanced by Chris\nFirestone and Nathan Jacobs in their In Defense of Kant\u2019s\nReligion. For example, these authors hold that Kant\u2019s\nportrayal of moral evil in Part One is shaped by an \u201cAugustinian\nmetaphysic\u201d (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), that in Part Two\nKant promotes the idea of the Incarnation, utilizing a\n\u201cScotistic understanding of divine being\u201d (Firestone &\nJacobs 2008: 161) and that Part Four not only concludes with an\nargument for the \u201cpriority of belief in Christianity\u201d but\ndefends the necessity of special revelation which, as they earlier\nclaim, is necessary for Kant\u2019s critical philosophy as a whole\n(Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 115).\n\nA similar position is advanced by Stephen Palmquist who finds in the\nReligion not only an examination of those aspects of rational\nreligion which conform with Christian doctrine, but also a\nphilosophical defense of the need for revelation. Palmquist claims,\nfor example, that Religion\u2019s treatment of Original Sin\nis used by Kant to articulate \u201cwhat we might call a Christ-sized\n\u2018hole\u2019 in the heart of humanity\u2019s rational\ncapacity\u201d (Palmquist 2016: 165), that Kant \u201cregarded the\nChristian Gospel as a genuine revelation\u201d (Palmquist 2016: 166)\nand that an otherwise deficient \u201cbare reason\u201d requires\nrevelatory content in order that we may \u201cbelieve\u201d in our\nown capacity to imitate the \u201carchetype of perfection\u201d\n(Palmquist 2016: 166). That is, Palmquist contends that, in line with\ntraditional Christianity, Kant regards our salvation as dependent upon\nhaving faith in the historical reality of the Incarnation.\n3.6.2 A Failed Christian apologist\n\nA second school of interpretation likewise maintains that Kant wrote\nthe Religion for the purposes of offering a philosophical\ndefense of traditional Christian doctrines. This school, however,\nholds that he was ultimately unsuccessful. This is a view which\nprincipally flows from Karl Barth\u2019s 1947 Die protestantische\nTheologie im 19. Jahrhundert, and is adopted by a group of later\nphilosophers of religion including members of the school of\n\u201cReformed Epistemology\u201d, including Philip Quinn, Nicholas\nWolterstorff and John Hare.\n\nWithin Kant circles, they are best known for the so-called\n\u201cConundrum\u201d interpretation of Kant\u2019s\nReligion, where these authors protest that Kant\u2019s\nventure into philosophical theology is not only inconsistent with the\nepistemic strictures of Transcendental Idealism (Wolterstorff 1998),\nbut also is internally inconsistent in virtue of the fact that its\nunderstanding of Original Sin is essentially Augustinian while its\nunderstanding of moral restoration is Pelagian. Wolterstorff goes so\nfar as to claim that Kant\u2019s philosophical theology suffers from\n\u201cnot just implausibility or tension, but internal\ncontradiction\u201d (Wolterstorff 1991: 49). Likewise, John Hare\n(1996) declares it an outright \u201cfailure\u201d and Gordon\nMichalson (1990) contends that the Religion contains a litany\nof \u201cwobbles\u201d between incompatible Christian and\nEnlightenment commitments.\n\nAlthough there are a number of other targets of criticism, their main\ncontention is that Kant inconsistently accepts (a) the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin which holds that our moral capacities have\nthrough the Fall been damaged in such a way that we are incapable of\nmoral improvement without Sanctifying Grace; and yet (b) Kant\nsubscribes to what they call his \u201cStoic Maxim\u201d that\n\u201ca person\u2019s moral worth is determined entirely by that\nperson himself\u201d (Wolterstorff 1991: 48). Recently, Andrew\nChignell has accepted the essence of the \u201cConundrum\u201d\nobjection, relying upon it as a reason why Kant must appeal to hope:\nsince Kant\u2019s alleged \u201cStoic Maxim\u201d leaves no room\nfor divine aid, and yet divine aid seems to be needed, it can be (at\nbest) an object of hope, since unlike other propositional attitudes,\nhope is rationally permissible in the face of a (seeming)\nimpossibility so long as it does not rise to an impossibility of\n\u201cthe most fundamental modal level\u201d (Chignell 2014:\n114\u2013115).\n3.6.3 Non-doxic theologian\n\nA third school holds that despite appearances to the contrary, the\nReligion does not engage in \u201ctheological speculation\nconcerning the doctrine of grace in any form\u201d (DiCenso 2012:\n117). This view is advanced by James DiCenso in his 2012 commentary on\nthe Religion, and more recently by Allen Wood in his Kant\nand Religion (2020). The former\u2019s 2012 commentary\nadvises that we avoid any literal reading of religious doctrines in\nthe text, and that we should instead interpret Kant\u2019s treatment\nof them as presenting no more than our moral ideals in\n\u201cimaginatively enhanced or pictorial form\u201d (2012:\n28).  Likewise, in the latter\u2019s Kant and\nReligion (2020), the author presents\nthe Religion as a study of how we can understand\nChristianity\u2019s presentation of a \u201csecond-person relationship\nbetween myself and God\u201d (Wood 2020: 137) as instead symbols\nfor a first-person \u201cself-relation\u201d (Wood 2020: 137,\n143) through which we gain \u201ca meaningful and\nemotionally enriched way of relating to our own past\u201d (Wood\n2020: 145). Interestingly, these interpretations\ncohere with certain interpretations of Kant\u2019s philosophical\ntheology in the Opus Postumum (see Section 4 below), with\nboth extending not only the thesis that God, for Kant, is nothing but\na symbol of our moral ideals, but that all religious doctrines\ninvolving the supersensible should likewise be interpreted as\nsuch.\n\nFurther, both interpretations pick up on a number of comments in\nthe Religion where Kant associates the historical side of\nreligion with our need for symbols to help us with the \u201chighest\nconcepts and grounds of reason\u201d (AK 6:109 [1793]) and hopes for\na future time where we will no longer need \u201call statutes that\nrest on history\u201d (AK 6:121 [1793]). Nevertheless, this aspect\nof Kant\u2019s treatment of religion does not apply to the\npostulates, nor does it pertain to the underlying moral/theological\nissues which are symbolized in specific doctrines (e.g., our innate\npropensity to evil as represented in the story of Genesis, or our hope\nfor divine as represented in the Crucifixion).\n\nWhat principally differentiates DiCenso (2012) and Wood (2020),\nhowever, is that the former\u2019s hermeneutic denies outright that Kant\never engages with any doctrine in its literal form, whereas the latter\nsees the core goal of the Religion to \u201cinterpret\nrevealed Christianity in such a way \u2026 [to] show that reason and\nChristianity are allies, not enemies\u201d (Wood 2020: 20). But in\norder to realize that goal, doctrines have to be rendered as just\nsymbols. So, while Wood recognizes that Kant rejects various doctrines\n(e.g. the story of Abraham and Isaac on Wood 2020: 14; and the\ninheritability of sin on Wood 2020: 62), such rejections occur only\nwhen doctrines are understood literally.  Accordingly, Wood would have\nus look past Kant\u2019s engagements with literal doctrines and take Kant\nas claiming that they need to be understood just as symbols. This\nwould then allow for the thesis that \u201ceverything in revealed\n(Christian) faith is compatible with rational faith\u201d (Wood 2020:\n20), which Wood asserts is the aim of the so-called \u201cSecond\nExperiment\u201d of the\nReligion, i.e. the goal of the Second Experiment is\nto \u201cdisprove the hypothesis... [that] there are parts\nof revealed Christianity that are demonstrably and permanently\nincompatible with rational religion\u201d (Wood 2020: 20). \n3.6.4 Pure rational system of religion\n\nA fourth interpretative position is that the aim of Religion\nis to (a) examine the scope of \u201cunity\u201d or\n\u201ccompatibility\u201d between rational religion and historical\nfaith and (b) evaluate which aspects of historical faith (with\nChristianity being the primary focus) are apt vehicles for rational\nreligion versus those which are incompatible with it (Pasternack\n2014). Hence, the Religion was not written as a Christian\napologetic, but rather is Kant\u2019s inquiry into the relationship\nbetween natural theology and revealed religion. However, unlike the\nmany other such inquiries written during the era, Kant\u2019s own\nversion of natural theology is one that shaped by moral rather than\ntheoretical reason.\n\nBy way of this interpretative framework, Pasternack (2014) maintains\nthat the Religion is both compatible with the epistemic\nstrictures of Transcendental Idealism (contrary the interpretations\nsummarized above) as well as internally consistent. As for the\ndiscussions where Kant appears to be guided by an \u201cAugustinian\nmetaphysic\u201d (Firestone & Jacobs 2008: 136), \u201cfirmly\nensconced within the Augustinian tradition\u201d (Quinn 1988: 91) or\n\u201caccommodating\u201d (Wood 1970: 246) tenets \u201cfundamental\nto Augustine\u201d (Beiser 2006: 594), he is rather examining such\ntenets in order to determine whether or not they have\n\u201cunity\u201d or \u201ccompatibility\u201d with rational\nreligion. Such doctrines as Original Sin, Grace, the Incarnation,\nVicarious Atonement and so forth are thus examined by Kant in the\nReligion in order to, in each case, assess whether or not\nthey cohere with his moral anthropology and doctrine of the highest\ngood.\n3.7 The Aims and Structure of the Religion\n\nUntil the recent spate of commentaries on the Religion,\nlittle work has been done on its overall aims and structure. Although\nPart One of the text has long been mined for insights into\nKant\u2019s picture of the moral agency, such studies did not\nconsider how the overall text might inform the passages minded\ntherefrom. The last decade, however, has seen the publication of a\nnumber of commentaries on the Religion, each with their own\ndistinctive interpretations (Firestone & Jacobs 2008, DiCenso\n2012, Pasternack 2014, Miller 2015, Palmquist 2016), most of whose\nauthors are mentioned in this entry. The above section also provides a\nbrief overview of their respective positions with regards to the\nrelationship between Kant\u2019s Religion and core Christian\ndoctrines. In this section, we will briefly review what Kant himself\nsays about his project and how it unfolds through its four parts.\n3.7.1 The two prefaces\n\nTo begin, the publication of the Religion (1793) has a\ncomplicated history. Kant initially planned to write a series of\nessays on Christian doctrines, but that was frustrated when the second\nof these essays was denied official imprimatur. Because the Prussian\nCensorship Commission had different rules for the publication of\narticles versus books, Kant chose to combine the planned essays into a\nsingle volume, and to avoid further scrutiny by the Commission, he\nmade sure that it was assessed as a work of philosophy rather than\ntheology. Although such maneuvers ultimately led to his censorship\nduring the reign of Frederick William II, Kant nevertheless was able\nto publish the Religion, whose First Preface includes, after\nan initial discussion of how through the highest good \u201cmorality\nleads inevitably to religion\u201d (AK 6:8n), a defense of his\nrationale for treating the work as one of philosophical theology\nrather than \u201cbiblical theology\u201d (AK 6:7\u20136:11). The\nPreface then ends with Kant\u2019s characterization of the\nReligion as an \u201cattempt\u201d or\n\u201cexperiment\u201d (Versuch) at determining the scope\nof overlap between the \u201cpure philosophical doctrine of\nreligion\u201d (AK 6:10) and the contents of historical faith\n(especially Christianity).\n\nThe Preface to the second edition begins with a discussion of the\nReligion\u2019s title, which as Kant explains, is meant to\ndepict two overlapping domains, the \u201cwider sphere of\nfaith\u201d and the \u201cnarrower\u201d sphere of the \u201cpure\nreligion of reason\u201d (AK 6:12). Kant then writes that\nfrom \u201cthis standpoint I can also make this second\nexperiment\u201d (zweiten Versuch), without, however,\nexplicitly enumerating a \u201cfirst experiment\u201d.\n\nSome have proposed (Hare 1996, Reardon 1988) that the unstated\n\u201cfirst experiment\u201d pertains to the domain of overlap\nbetween Biblical Theology and the Pure Rational System of Religion.\nThe Second Experiment then seeks\n\n\nto show that certain items in the outer circle lead back within the\ninner circle when looked at in the light of, or translated in terms of\nmoral concepts. (Hare 1996: 40)\n\n\nOthers have proposed that the First Experiment pertains to the\nReligion\u2019s \u201ctranscendental elements\u201d while\nthe Second Experiment \u201caims at assessing one particular\nempirical religion\u201d, namely Christianity (Palmquist 2000: 143),\nor serves as a philosophical apologetic for Christianity (Firestone\n& Jacobs 2008).\n\nPasternack (2017b), however, argues that the interpretative debate\nover the first/second experiment distinction rests on a simple\nmistake. Normally, Versuch would be translated as\n\u201cattempt\u201d, but early Anglophone translators of the\nReligion chose instead \u201cexperiment\u201d. That choice\nhas passed along through contemporary translations and has led\ninterpreters to make far too much of this passage. The passage appears\ntowards the opening of the Preface to the second edition of\nthe Religion and is, as argued by Pasternack, merely meant by\nKant to indicate that he is issuing his second attempt\n[zweiten Versuch] at the very same non-enumerated\n\u201cexperiment\u201d [Versuch] similarly described in the\nPreface to the first edition (compare the language at AK 6:10\nin the First Preface to AK 6:12 in the Second). In other words,\nPasternack asserts that the many attempts to divide out the\nReligion into two distinct \u201cexperiments\u201d is an\nunfortunate byproduct of the secondary literature, unrelated to the\nactual structure of the text.\n\nWhat both Prefaces ultimately explain is that Kant\u2019s goal in the\nReligion is to (a) provide an inquiry into the scope of\noverlap between historical faith (especially in the form of\nChristianity) and pure rational religion; and (b) use the latter as a\nguide for distinguishing between which elements of the former are\nmatters of \u201cgenuine religion\u201d rather than\n\u201ccult\u201d (AK 6:12\u201313). Each of the\nReligion\u2019s four parts then take on core issues with\nChristian doctrine.\n3.7.2 Part one\n\nIn Part One, Kant\u2019s aim is to examine the Christian doctrine of\nOriginal Sin, especially as he would have been exposed to it through\nhis Lutheran Pietist upbringing. His interest is in finding out\nwhether there is any overlap between this historical doctrine and pure\nrational religion. More specifically, his goal is to assess the\ndoctrine of Original Sin so as to determine what (if any) overlap it\nhas with rational religion. He thus considers such matters as: how can\nour moral condition be innate and yet we can remain responsible for\nit; whether, as would have been held by the Augustinian tradition,\nOriginal Sin involves such a fundamental corruption of our faculties\nthat we lose the cognitive and volitional capacities needed to will\nthe good; and then in the \u201cGeneral Remark\u201d or first\nParergon, whether or not our corrupted moral condition is\nsuch that divine aid is required for us to overcome it. Throughout, we\nsee Kant taking up these and other themes within the Augustinian\nconception of Original Sin, sometimes finding places of overlap with\nrational religion, sometimes finding the two in conflict.\n3.7.3 Part two\n\nThe Second Part of the Religion moves on to Christology and\nthe alleged role of Christ in our salvation. Kant begins with a\ndiscussion of the Incarnation and whether it can be interpreted in\nsuch a way that is compatible with pure rational religion (AK\n6:60\u20136:66). He then moves on to three\n\u201cdifficulties:\u201d how to understand the doctrine of\nSanctifying Grace (the \u201cchange of heart\u201d or moral\nregeneration) in relation to pure rational religion; whether an\nindividual can know his/her moral status as having undergone a\n\u201cchange of heart\u201d, and how this relates to the challenge\nof moral perseverance; how to understand the \u201cdebt of sin\u201d\nor the issue of \u201cJustifying Grace\u201d. On this issue, we\nagain see Kant opposing the prevailing doctrines of his day,\nexplicitly rejecting the idea of \u201cvicarious atonement\u201d (AK\n6:72\u201373) as anathema to pure rational religion.\n3.7.4 Part three\n\nThe Third Part of the Religion considers religion from a\nhistorical standpoint, including the need for the founding of a\nuniversal church, the importance of that church for the moral\nimprovement of society (the \u201cethical community\u201d),\nquestions of divine providence, and eschatology.\n\nKant\u2019s focus in this part is the social dimension of moral evil,\nwhere he draws from the Predisposition to Humanity discussed in Part\nOne (see Wood 1999), and argues that we \u201cmutually corrupt each\nother\u2019s moral dispositions and make one another evil\u201d (AK\n6:94). The goal of the universal church is to promote a new sort of\nsocial exchange guided by our collective \u201cduty sui\ngeneris\u201d of human beings to work cooperatively towards\n\u201ca common end, namely the promotion of the highest good\u201d\n(AK 6:97). The ethical community is then presented as an ideal state\nof affairs reflecting the realization of the highest good.\n3.7.5 Part four\n\nThe final part of the Religion focuses on ecclesiology. After\nan initial discussion of the religious framework for the ethical\ncommunity, Kant offers an important discussion of Christianity as a\nnatural versus a \u201clearned\u201d religion. The point of the\nformer is that \u201cgenuine religion\u201d, is one that can be\n\u201ccomprehensibly and convincingly\u201d communicated to all\nhuman beings \u201cthrough their own reason\u201d (AK 6:162) without\nany necessary role for revelation. The latter, by contrast, turns to\nthe \u201cdogmas of faith\u201d (AK 6:163) and its dangers. This\nbegins Kant\u2019s discussion of \u201ccounterfeit service\u201d,\n\u201cpriestcraft\u201d and the \u201cdelusions of religion\u201d\nhe sees in ecclesiastical practice. While rational religion maintains\nthat nothing apart from \u201cgood life-conduct\u201d is required to\n\u201cbecome well-pleasing to God\u201d (AK 6:170), historical faith\nroutinely claims that God\u2019s judgment is based instead on our\ndoctrinal commitments and liturgical observances.\n\nTherein, Kant examines the ultimate \u201csubjective ground of\nreligious delusion\u201d (AK 6:168), how the artificies of organized\nreligion let us \u201cslip back into evil\u201d (AK 6:184) and then\nfinally how practices including prayer, church attendance, and rituals\ncould nevertheless still be reconstituted for the genuine moral\nreligion of a universal church and \u201ccosmopolitan moral\ncommunity\u201d (AK 6:194\u2013200).\n3.7.6 The Parerga or General Remarks\n\nEach of the four parts of the Religion close with a section\nentitled \u201cGeneral Remark\u201d or \u201cParergon\u201d\n(Supplement or Appendix) to its main body. In the Second Edition to\nthe Religion, Kant adds a brief explanation of the function\nof the Parerga, describing them as concerned with matters\nwhich are at the \u201cborder\u201d of the \u201cboundaries of pure\nreason\u201d. He lists these as: (1) the effects of grace; (2)\nmiracles; (3) the holy mysteries; (4) the means of grace. Kant\nexplains that reason\n\n\ndoes not contest the possibility or actuality of the objects of these\nideas; it just cannot incorporate them into its maxims of thought or\naction. (AK 6:52)\n\n\nThey are topics to which we are lead given the issues under discussion\nthrough the main body of each part, but are all matters of caution for\nus for while they each pertain to a need that seems unfulfilled\nthrough what pure reason can allow for genuine religion, and in some\nmanner may invigorate our moral lives, they are all also paths to\n\u201cdogmatic faith\u201d (6:52).\n\nHence, each part of the Religion ends with a caution somewhat\nakin to the cautions which shape the Critique of Pure\nReason\u2019s Dialectic: though the needs of reason drive us to\nspeculation, we must not fall into error thereby. For example, while\nthe logic of ought implies can warrants our belief that a\n\u201cchange of heart\u201d is possible, we cannot either affirm or\ndeny a role for divine aid/grace. Likewise, while Transcendental\nIdealism leaves room for the possibility of a \u201csupernatural\nintervention\u201d (AK 6:191), we are not epistemically situated so\nthat we can ever justifiably claim that some particular effect was in\nfact due to such intervention.\n\nThe parerga thus are used by Kant to separate out what\ndoctrines of historical faith the pure rational system of religion can\nassess versus what doctrines that\u2014while we are compelled to\nspeculate about them\u2014require our agnosticism. As such, the\nparerga reflect limit issues, at the \u201cborder\u201d of\nrational religion, for which there is both a theoretical interest and\nmoral need to visit, but also where the dangers that we stray into\ndogmatism are the greatest (Palmquist 2016, Muchnik 2019).\n4. Religion in the Opus Postumum\n\nIn the mid-1790s, Kant began to explore what he saw as a \u201cgap...\nin the critical philosophy\u201d (Kant to Garve, September 21, 1798\nAK 12:257), namely, how to transition from what he established about\nnatural science in general in the Metaphysical Foundations of\nNatural Science to physics in particular. However, his notes on\nthis \u201cgap\u201d exceeded his original plan, as they came to\ncover not only how to transition from the foundations of natural\nscience to physics, but also self-positing, God, and the nature of\ntranscendental philosophy. These notes, which were composed during a\nroughly seventeen-year period, and came to be assembled under the\ntitle, Opus Postumum, prompt questions as to whether or not\nKant\u2019s views on God during this period represent a break from or\ncontinuity with the philosophy of religion he presented in his\nprevious works. And further, if there is continuity, in what way might\nits contents help to illuminate Kant\u2019s overall Critical\nphilosophy of religion?\n\nFor instance, there are many passages in the Opus Postumum\nwhich present God not as a substance or a being outside of us, but\nrather an ideal or thought-object. For some, this is taken as an\nindication that in Kant\u2019s final years, he withdrew from his more\naffirmative religious views seen up through the mid-1790s\n(F\u00f6rster 2000). While for others, it finally articulates the view\nthat Kant held throughout the Critical period, namely that despite\ntextual evidence to the contrary, Kant never advanced any argument,\nmoral or otherwise, for belief in God (W. Sullivan 1971, Guyer 2000,\nByrne 2007).\n\nNevertheless, amidst the passages in the Opus Postumum which\npresent God as merely an ideal or thought-object, there are others\nwhich are not so deflationary, presenting God in a manner similar to\nthe more familiar works of the Critical period (AK 21:13\u201314 [OP\n220\u2013222], AK 22:126\u2013127 [OP 206\u2013207]).\n\nOne way to understand these discrepancies is to recognize that the\nOpus Postumum is a collection of notes written over more than\na decade, unedited, and possibly different from what would have been\nthe final version of the treatise. Hence, Kant might have been\nrethinking his philosophy of religion, exploring possibilities, or\nworking through some ideas which could fill his perceived \u201cgap\nin the critical philosophy\u201d, ideas that neither undercut the\nepistemic strictures of the Critique of Pure Reason nor the\nreligiously affirmative language in his practical philosophy.\n\nFurther, though Kant sometimes describes God as an ideal or\nthought-object, he also says the same about the world and\nman-in-the-world, raising the possibility that his discussions of God\ntook place in two separate spheres: transcendental philosophy proper,\nwhich provides the purely formal conditions of metaphysics and so\nincludes only the ideals we must construct in order to posit ourselves\nin the world (namely, God, the world, and man-in-the-world); and\nmetaphysics, which is transcendental philosophy applied to certain\nobjects (\u201c[the transcendental philosopher] addresses merely what\nis formal, [the metaphysician] what is material (the object, the\nmaterial)\u201d [AK 21:79 [OP: 246]]). If this is right, then it\ncould be that Kant does not repudiate or deflate his prior philosophy\nof religion, but merely adds a new layer to it. Unfortunately, the\nOpus Postumum\u2019s unfinished state makes it difficult to\ncome to a secure conclusion about where Kant\u2019s thinking on\nreligion stood in his final years.",
