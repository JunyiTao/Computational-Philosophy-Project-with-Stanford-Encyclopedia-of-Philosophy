    "main_text": "Metaethics of Value Judgments || Experimental Confirmation of Value Judgments\n2.4 Experimental Confirmation of Value Judgments\n\nDewey\u2019s pragmatist moral epistemology follows from his\ninstrumental account of value judgments. It is uncontroversial that\ninstrumental judgments are subject to empirical testing and\nconfirmation, since they involve empirical claims about causation. We\ntest scientific hypotheses by bringing about their antecedents and\nseeing if the results are as they predicted. Similarly, we test value\njudgments by acting on them and seeing if we value the consequences in\nthe way the judgment predicted. Acting on our value judgments \u2014\nputting them into practice \u2014 supplies the data for confirming or\ndisconfirming them. Roughly speaking, a value judgment hypothesizes\n\u201ctry it, you\u2019ll like it\u201d \u2014 a statement easily\nsubject to empirical verification and refutation. Intelligent value\njudgments proceed not by random trial-and-error, but from skilled\nprojection of prior confirmed \u201ctry-like\u201d regularities to\nanalogous novel situations, which are continuously modified in light\nof experiences of the wider consequences of trying in these new\nsituations.\n\nDewey derived several unsettling implications for traditional morality\nand traditional philosophical ethics from his moral epistemology.\nTraditional or conventional morality tries to enforce unquestioning\nobedience to its precepts. Dewey argued that this was a formula for\nperpetual immaturity, because it cut off all possibility of learning\nbetter ways to live by experimenting with them. Pragmatist moral\nepistemology also rejects philosophy\u2019s a priori,\ndialectical methods for determining the good and the right. One cannot\nprove that something is valuable by mere argument. Arguments, at best,\nmake certain value judgments plausible as hypotheses \u2014 and even\nthen, only if grounded in experience and reflection on the wider\nconsequences of acting on them. Ultimately, the hypotheses must be\ntested, by seeing how one values the actual results of putting them\ninto practice. It follows that the dogmatism of traditional\nphilosophical ethics is folly. It hobbles progress in life. Even the\nbest confirmed value judgments can hold only provisionally.\nCircumstances change, thereby modifying the consequences of acting on\nparticular evaluations. Change requires us to revisit our original\nappraisals with an eye toward modifying them in light of these new\nconsequences (RP). Moreover, we don\u2019t know the consequences of\ntrials not performed. It is therefore always possible that we are\nmissing out on better modes of conduct that we haven\u2019t tested,\nor even imagined (VEK 25\u20136).\n",
