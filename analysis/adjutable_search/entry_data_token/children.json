This may suggest that serious\nphilosophical thinking is not for pre-adolescents. At least three\nreasons might be offered for accepting this view. First, philosophical\nthinking requires a level of cognitive development that, one may\nbelieve, is beyond the reach of most pre-adolescents. Second,\nespecially in the United States, the school curriculum is already\ncrowded; and introducing a subject like philosophy, it may be thought,\nwill distract students from what they need to learn. Third, given that\nphilosophical inquiry raises questions that more often than not resist\ndefinitive answers, it may encourage students to become skeptics\nrather than learners.

Can Children Philosophize?\n\nJean Piaget\u2019s (1933) well-known theory of cognitive development\nsuggests that prior to age 11 or 12, most children are not capable of\nphilosophical thinking. This is because, it holds, prior to this time,\nchildren are not capable of \u201cthinking about thinking,\u201d the\nsort of meta-level thinking that philosophical thinking requires. This\nlevel of cognitive development includes analogical reasoning about\nrelationships, such as: \u201cBicycle is to handlebars as ship is to\nrudder, with \u2018steering mechanism\u2019 being the similar\nrelationship\u201d (Goswami, p. xxi). However, there is a solid body\nof psychological research that indicates Piaget\u2019s account\nseriously underestimates children\u2019s cognitive abilities\n(Astington, 1993; Gopnik, et al., 1999; Gopnik, 2009).\n\nPhilosopher Gareth Matthews went further and argued at length that\nPiaget failed to see the philosophical thinking manifest in the very\nchildren he studied. In Philosophy and the Young Child,\nMatthews (1980) provides a number of delightful illustrations of very\nyoung children\u2019s philosophical puzzlement. For example:\n\nTIM (about six years), while busily engaged in licking a pot,\nasked, \u201cPapa, how can we be sure that everything is not a\ndream?\u201d (p. 1)\nJORDAN (five years), going to bed at eight one evening, asked,\n\u201cIf I go to bed at eight and get up at seven in the morning, how\ndo I really know that the little hand of the clock has gone around\nonly once? Do I have to stay up all night to watch it? If I look away\neven for a short time, maybe the small hand will go around\ntwice.\u201d (p. 3)\nOne day JOHN EDGAR (four years), who had seen airplanes take off,\nrise, and gradually disappear into the distance, took his first plane\nride. When the plane stopped ascending and the seat-belt sign went\nout, John Edgar turned to his father and said in a rather relieved,\nbut still puzzled, tone of voice, \u201cThings don\u2019t really get\nsmaller up here.\u201d (p. 4)\n\n\nHowever, it might be objected, commonly observable as they might be,\nmore than such anecdotes are needed to show that children are capable\nof serious philosophical thinking. What is needed is evidence that\nchildren are capable of sustained philosophical discussion.\nMatthews (1984) provides illustrations of this, too. For example,\nmeeting with a group of 8\u201311 year olds, he used the following\nexample to develop a story for discussion:\n\nIan (six years old) found to his chagrin that the three children of\nhis parents\u2019 friends monopolized the television; they kept him\nfrom watching his favorite program. \u201cMother,\u201d he asked in\nfrustration, \u201cwhy is it better for three children to be selfish\nthan one?\u201d (Matthews 1984, 92\u20133)\n\n\nThis generated a lively discussion in which children commented on the\ninconsiderateness of the three visiting children, the desirability of\nworking out a solution that would satisfy all four children, the\nimportance of respecting people\u2019s rights, and how one might feel\nif he or she were in Ian\u2019s place. Matthews then posed a possible\nutilitarian approach: \u201cWhat about this argument, that if we let\nthe three visitors have their way, three people will be made happy\ninstead of just one?\u201d One reply was that it would not be fair\nfor three people to get what they want at the expense of a fourth.\nThis triggered a discussion of fairness that addressed more specific\nconcerns about the relative ages of the children, whether they are\nfriends, siblings, or strangers\u2014and what types of television\nprograms are involved.\n\nNo doubt, part of the explanation of the children\u2019s ability and\nwillingness to carry on an extended discussion of Ian\u2019s\ncircumstance is that they have faced similar challenges. Still, they\nexhibited a rather sophisticated grasp of the conceptual and moral\nissues at hand, which is what one might expect from children once they\nare invited to reflect on their own experiences.\n\nStories about children roughly one\u2019s own age can provide\nopportunities to discuss ideas that are most important to a child.\nConsider this example from Matthew Lipman\u2019s novel Lisa\n(1983). Harry and his friend Timmy go to a stamp club to trade stamps.\nAfterward they stop for ice cream cones, but Timmy discovers he has no\nmoney. Harry offers to buy him one, and Timmy says he will buy Harry a\ncone next time. As they are leaving the store, one of their classmates\ntrips Timmy. Timmy then knocks the tripper\u2019s books off the\ntable. After running away from the scene, Timmy and Harry talk about\nwhat has happened:\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t let them get away with it,\u201d Timmy\nremarked when they saw that they weren\u2019t being pursued and could\nslow down to a walk. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to stick his foot\nout.\u201d Then he added, \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t have to do\nwhat I did either. But, like I said before, turnabout is fair\nplay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomehow,\u201d Harry thought, \u201cit isn\u2019t quite the\nsame thing.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t figure out why. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d he said finally to Timmy. \u201cThe purpose\nof your stamp club is to exchange stamps. So when you give someone\nstamps, you\u2019re supposed to give something back. Just like if\nsomeone lends me money, I\u2019m supposed to give it back. But if\nsomeone pulls a dirty trick on you, should you do the same thing to\nhim? I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I had to get even,\u201d Timmy protested. \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t let him get away with it, tripping me like that for no\nreason.\u201d\n\nA bit later they met Lisa and Laura. Harry told the girls what had\nhappened and why he was puzzled. \u201cIt reminds me,\u201d remarked\nLisa, \u201cof last year when we were learning about how some\nsentences could be turned around and would stay true, while others,\nwhen you turned them around, would become false.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry agreed, \u201cbut there we found a rule.\nWhat\u2019s the rule here?\u201d Lisa tossed her long hair so that\nit hung over her right shoulder. \u201cIt looks like there are times\nwhen it is right to give back what we got and other times when it is\nwrong. But how do we tell which is which?\u201d (Lisa, pp.\n23\u20134)\n\n\nThis passage is an invitation to explore the moral nuances of\nreciprocity, or \u201creturning in kind.\u201d What might a group of\n10\u201311 year-olds have to say about this? Here is a sampling from\na lengthy discussion of the Lisa passage by a group of fifth\ngraders (Pritchard 1996). With very little prompting from the teacher,\nthe students raised and vigorously pursued questions such as the\nfollowing:\n\nWhat is likely to happen when we retaliate? Will this simply start\na long chain of trying to \u201cget things even\u201d that no one\n(other than perhaps the initiator) wants?\nCan retaliating really \u201cget things even\u201d? Can we even\nmake sense of \u201cgetting things even\u201d?\nIs it really right to respond to a wrong by returning in kind? Is\nthis trying to make a right out of two wrongs?\nWhat alternatives to trying to \u201cget things even\u201d might\nthere be? What would happen if you just ignore someone who is trying\nto get a rise out of you?\nWhen is self-defense the best strategy?\nIs there a difference between trying to \u201cget things\neven\u201d and trying to \u201cteach someone a lesson\u201d?\nCan something like the Golden Rule help us here? What does the\nGolden Rule mean? Is it a good rule?\n\n\nThoughtful and insightful questions like this are not unusual for\nchildren when they are given the opportunity to express them.\nThis discussion was prompted by a children\u2019s novel. However,\nstudents\u2019 regular classroom materials, works of art, thought\nexperiments, the daily news, or their own experiences can trigger\nphilosophical discussions of moral concepts and concerns.\n\nEven if one concedes that children are quite capable of engaging in\nextended discussions of moral concepts related to their own\nexperiences, what about philosophical ideas that are less immediately\nrelated to their practical affairs? Here is an illustration that\nbegins with logic and ends up in metaphysics.\n\nThe true sentence, \u201cAll oaks are trees\u201d becomes false when\nreversed. So does, \u201cAll carrots are vegetables.\u201d Can we\nsay that every true sentence beginning with \u2018all\u2019\nbecomes false when reversed? The children in Harry\nStottlemeier\u2019s Discovery initially are tempted to say, yes.\nBut at least as early as the 3rd grade, children easily\nfind exceptions. What about \u201cAll tigers are tigers\u201d, many\nwill ask. Others may respond that this is an uninteresting sentence,\noffering something like \u201cAll rabbits are hares,\u201d or\n\u201cAll mothers have children\u201d as alternatives. With\nrelatively little encouragement, they can come up with good\ndefinitions of geometric figures and differentiate them from proposed\ndefinitions that cannot be reversed. For example, \u201cAll squares\nare rectangles\u201d is true, but it becomes false when reversed.\n\u201cAll squares are rectangles with equal sides,\u201d however,\ncan be reversed.\n\nAlthough the study of logic is traditionally regarded as a part of\nphilosophy, critics might not find the reflections of children on such\nrules of logic terribly interesting philosophically. (Of course, some\nmight say this about elementary logic in the college classroom, as\nwell.) It is not that different from basic math and grammar, they\nmight object. Whether or not this is a fair assessment, for many\nchildren it is but a short step from logic to metaphysics. Here is an\nexample from a 4th grade class that had just been asked\nwhether true sentences beginning with \u2018all\u2019 always become\nfalse when reversed (Pritchard 1996). After the usual \u201cAll\ntigers are tigers\u201d and \u201cAll rabbits are hares\u201d were\nsuggested, a student asked, \u201cHow about \u2018All answers have\nquestions\u2019 and \u2018All questions have answers\u2019?\u201d\nFortunately, the teacher paused to explore this with the class,\nasking\u201cDo all answers have questions?\u201d Of course, replied\nthe students, otherwise we would not say that we have an\nanswer.\n\nThe teacher continued, \u201cHow about the other sentence? Do you\nthink that all questions have answers?\u201d What followed was a\nflood of responses:\n\nStudent #1: \u201cIs there life in the center of the\nsun?\u201d\nStudent #2: \u201cEven though we can\u2019t go there to find\nout, the question still has an answer.\u201d\nStudent #3: \u201cHow many grains of sand are there on\nearth?\u201d\nStudent #4: \u201cThere\u2019s a definite number even though we\ndon\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\nStudent #3: \u201cThe wind will blow them all around, and\nwe\u2019ll count some more than once.\u201d\nStudent #5: \u201cThere are too many to count.\u201d\nStudent #6: \u201cHow many grains of sand are there on all the\nplanets?\u201d\nStudent #7: \u201cHow many trees are there on earth?\u201d\nStudent #4: \u201cThat\u2019s easier than grains of sand. We\ncould count the trees.\u201d\nStudent #7: \u201cBy the time you finish counting them, some\nwould have fallen down and others would have started to\ngrow.\u201d\nStudent #8: \u201cDid God make time begin?\u201d\nStudent #9: \u201cYou mean, if there is a God, did he\nmake time begin?\u201d\nStudent #7: \u201cDoes space have limits?\u201d\nStudent #5: \u201cYeah, what would happen if you got to the end\nof space and tried to put your hand out? If you couldn\u2019t, what\nwould be holding it back on the outside?\u201d\nStudent #6: \u201cMaybe what would hold your hand back is on the\ninside. There wouldn\u2019t be any outside.\u201d\n\n\nMany of the students seemed to be struggling to move from questions\nthat are difficult, if not impossible, to answer because of our\npractical limitations (e.g., not being certain that a\nparticular grain of sand has not already been counted) to questions\nthat in principle are unanswerable. Finally, with a\nmischievous grin on his face, one of the students asked, \u201cWill\ntime end?\u201d The problem, he explained, is that if time did end,\nno one would be able later to confirm that this was so.\n\nHere is another illustration of how quickly a discussion of logic can\nmove to a discussion of deep philosophical issues (Pritchard, 1985).\nThis is a group of 5th graders considering the sentence,\n\u201cAll people are animals.\u201d One of the students offered this\nas another example of a true sentence that becomes false when\nreversed. Jeff objected that \u201cAll people are animals\u201d is\nnot true. Chip proceeded to develop a taxonomy that relegated people,\nalong with elephants and tigers, under the heading of mammals, mammals\nunder animals, and animals under living things. Jeff continued to\nobject.\n\n\nChip: \u201cJeff, what are people? Just tell me, what are people? You\ncan\u2019t answer that, can you?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cYes, I can.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cA person.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cWhat\u2019s a person?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cA living somebody.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cA living somebody could be a whale.\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cI said, somebody, not an\nanimal\u2026.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cYou can check every single book out there in the\nlibrary\u2014well, every one that\u2019s about\nus\u2026.\u201d\n\nLarry: \u201cI want to know why everyone\u2019s getting so huffy\nabout a little subject.\u201d\n\nRich: \u201cWe\u2019re thinking! That\u2019s what\nwe\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nAmy: \u201cDoes anyone have an encyclopedia in here so we can look up\neither animals, mammals, or persons?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cWe\u2019re all humans. So, if this Mars guy saw us, he\nwould say, \u2018Hey, look, there\u2019s some human beings.\u2019\nHe wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, look, there\u2019s some animals\ndown there.\u2019\u201d\n\nMike: \u201cMartians, if there are any, would say, \u2018Hey, look\nat those weird looking creatures,\u2019 or something like that. They\nwouldn\u2019t know what we are. They don\u2019t know\nanything about us.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cThere\u2019s living life, okay? Then you branch off from\nthere. You have animals, plants, and whatever the other stuff\nis\u2014you know, molecules and things like that. Now you go to the\nanimals and you branch off\u2014mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and\nwhatever there is. Then you branch off and you have all these special\nhumans. Is that right so far, Jeff?\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cJust go on.\u201d\n\nChip: \u201cWell, I just want to know if you agree so far.\u201d\n\nJeff: \u201cJust go on. Go on. I\u2019m not going to change my mind.\nThat\u2019s all\u2026. I\u2019m not an animal. I\u2019m a person,\nand I\u2019m going to stay that way.\u201d\n\nAmy: \u201cPeople are a type of animal, like a bird is. That\u2019s\ndifferent than like an elephant is. A bird\u2019s different than an\nelephant. And we\u2019re different than a bird.\u201d\n\n\nThe discussion continued for several more minutes. As the group\ndispersed, one student remarked to another, \u201cIf we want to, we\ncould argue for hours!\u201d \u201cFor days,\u201d replied the\nsecond. Meeting weekly after school in the local public library, this\ngroup of children returned the next week with an encyclopedia to try\nto settle the matter. After several minutes of discussion, the teacher\nasked the students if they thought everything in the encyclopedia is\ntrue.\n\n\nEmily: \u201cSome things we\u2019re not sure of; and the\nencyclopedia could put down every word about how the solar system was\nformed, and it would probably say there was big dust that spun around\nlike a top. But we\u2019re not sure about that. And, so, that could\nbe wrong.\u201d\n\n\nThe teacher asked whether, in such cases, the encyclopedia would say,\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure.\u201d\n\n\nMike: \u201cIt\u2019ll say \u2018hypothesis\u2019\u2014which is a\nguess.\u201d\n\nKurt: \u201cIt\u2019ll say we\u2019re not sure yet.\u201d\n\n\nSo, the discussion retained its philosophical vitality. This\nparticular group continued to meet weekly for the entire school year,\ndiscussing a wide range of philosophical topics, including: the\nrelationship between the mind and the brain, differences (and\nsimilarities) between dreams and reality, knowledge of other minds,\nself-knowledge, and relationships between evidence and knowledge.\n2. Philosophy in a Crowded Curriculum\n\nThose favoring adding philosophy to K-12 school programs face the\nchallenges of an already crowded curriculum and growing pressure to\nprovide quantifiable evidence of student mastery of the standard\nsubjects of history, literature, math, and science. Where is time to\nbe found for the give-and-take of philosophical discussions? Adding\nphilosophy to the mix, doubters object, only makes matters worse. Not\nonly is it yet another subject, it is one that many teachers may find\nunsettling. They may fear that philosophy\u2019s continual\nquestioning will actually interfere with students\u2019 mastery of\nthe subjects already in the curriculum. Given the unsettling nature of\nmuch philosophical inquiry, they may feel vulnerable as teachers\nbecause they are not confident of their own answers to the questions\nposed.\n\nAdding to this problem is increasing pressure on teachers to\ndemonstrate that their students are performing at satisfactory levels\nin already established subjects. Standardized tests are commonly used\nas the measure of student achievement. Marked by definitive,\nunambiguous questions and answers, these tests do not place a premium\non philosophical reflection. Since student performance is typically\nlinked to school funding, this is not something teachers can take\nlightly, however skeptical some of them might be about the educational\nvalue of preparing their students to perform well on standardized\ntests.\n\nIn response, advocates of bringing philosophy into the schools such as\nMatthew Lipman and his colleague Ann Margaret Sharp have countered\nthat the introduction of philosophy can enhance the entire educational\nexperience of students. They urge that the aim is more than simply the\nintroduction of one more subject in the schools. Philosophy, they\ninsist, invites students to reflect on relationships among different\nareas of inquiry and to make sense of their educational experiences as\na whole. This can add to the meaningfulness of students\u2019\neducation as a whole. In addition, philosophy can make important\ncontributions to another area of concern that cuts across the\ncurriculum, critical thinking.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Matthew Lipman became dismayed at the low quality of\nargumentation employed by presumably well-educated citizens discussing\nthe Vietnam war and society\u2019s ills in general. Convinced that\nthe teaching of logic should begin long before college, he tried to\nfigure out a way to do this that would stimulate the interest of\n10\u201311 year olds. Leaving his secure position of teaching\nphilosophy at Columbia University for an open ended one at Montclair\nState College, he undertook work on his first children\u2019s novel,\nHarry Stottlemeier\u2019s Discovery. Lipman\u2019s concerns\nabout the level of critical thinking in society in general, and the\nschools in particular, were not his alone. By the 1970s the hue and\ncry for teaching critical thinking in the schools was, if not clear,\nat least loud; and it has continued largely unabated to the\npresent.\n\nWhat is meant by \u2018critical thinking\u2019? Characterizations\nrange in complexity from Robert Ennis\u2019s admirably brief,\n\u201creasonable reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what\nto believe or do\u201d (Ennis 1987) to a complex statement by a group\nof 46 panelists convened by the American Philosophical\nAssociation\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy to employ the\nDelphi Method of striving for consensus:\n\nWe understand critical thinking to be purposeful, self-regulatory\njudgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and\ninference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon\nwhich that judgment is based\u2026. The ideal critical thinking is\nhabitually inquisitive, well-informed, trustful of reason,\nopen-minded, flexible, fair-minded in evaluation, honest in facing\npersonal biases, prudent in making judgments, willing to reconsider,\nclear about issues, orderly in complex matters, diligent in seeking\nrelevant information, reasonable in the selection of criteria, focused\nin inquiry, and persistent in seeking results which are as precise as\nthe subject and the circumstances of inquiry permit. (Facione, 1989)\n\n\nLipman was a member of this panel, and it is clear that his novels and\nteacher\u2019s manuals all strive to meet these objectives. His\nbriefer depiction of critical thinking is that it involves judgments\nbased on criteria, or reasons. Criteria, he says, can be appraised in\nterms of \u201cmegacriteria\u201d such as reliability, relevance,\nstrength, coherence, and consistency (Lipman 1991, p. 119). Critical\nthinking, he adds, is characterized as \u201cthinking that (1)\nfacilitates judgment because it (2) relies on criteria, (3) is\nself-correcting, and (4) is sensitive to context.\u201d (Lipman 1991,\np. 116)\n\nPicking up on the idea that critical thinking is sensitive to context,\nsome critics challenge the notion that critical thinking can be\nusefully taught independently of specific disciplinary areas (McPeck,\n1985). While conceding that there are some generic features of\ncritical thinking that cut across disciplines, they maintain that even\nthese features acquire their meanings only in specific contexts that\nvary across disciplines (such as history, sociology, biology,\nchemistry). However, unless the different disciplines ask questions\nabout their own basic assumptions and their relationships to one\nanother, critical thinking within those disciplines will overlook\nimportant questions that need attention. Philosophy does ask such\nquestions about the different disciplines, including itself.\n\nLipman\u2019s hope was that philosophy would acquire a central place\nin the K-12 curriculum, thus enabling students to develop their\ncritical thinking skills through philosophical questioning. At the\nsame time, he claimed, philosophy can help students make better sense\nof their educational experiences. By seeking to develop comprehensive\nperspectives, philosophy attempts to understand connections. A\ncurriculum that divides students\u2019 education into discrete,\nself-contained disciplines without encouraging philosophical questions\nabout the nature of those disciplines and their relationships to one\nanother invites a fragmented view of education. Lipman\u2019s\nproposed alternative is described in the next section, which describes\nthe K-12 program developed by the Institute for the Advancement of\nPhilosophy for Children (IAPC) that he and Ann Margaret Sharp\nfounded.\n\nShort of the ambitious program Lipman and his IAPC colleagues had in\nmind for the schools, there are more modest, but worthwhile, ways of\nbringing philosophical inquiry into the already existing disciplinary\nstructure in the schools. Teachers can invite their students to\nreflect on philosophical aspects of their subjects of study. At the\nsame time they study history, students can take some time to ask\nquestions about the extent to which historical accounts can be\nobjective\u2014and questions about what \u2018objectivity\u2019\nmight mean, and why it is or is not important to seek it. Similar\nquestions can be asked about the natural and social sciences,\nincluding questions about the extent to which science is, or ought to\nbe, \u201cvalue-free\u201d. In fact, if room for such questions is\nnot encouraged, one might well ask to what extent critical thinking\nitself is encouraged.\n\nFinally, especially since the passing of Lipman and Sharp in 2010 and\n2011, many of those originally inspired by their work have initiated\nefforts to introduce groups of children to philosophy outside the\nformal educational setting of the schools.\n3. The Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)\n\nThe educational movement known as Philosophy for Children got its\nstart in the early 1970s with the publication of Matthew\nLipman\u2019s philosophical novel for children, Harry\nStottlemeier\u2019s Discovery. In 1970 Harry made its\nentry into the Montclair Public Schools in New Jersey. By the mid-70s\nthe Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)\nwas formally in place at Montclair State College (now Montclair State\nUniversity). The media quickly picked up on reports of significant\nimprovements in the reading and critical thinking skills of middle\nschool children who were involved in IAPC programs. Subsequently, IAPC\nproduced materials consisting of Lipman\u2019s children\u2019s\nnovels and, under the leadership of IAPC colleague Ann Margaret Sharp,\naccompanying teacher workbooks for the entire K-12 curriculum.\nThousands of children in New Jersey, across the United States, and\neven around the world have subsequently been introduced to IAPC\neducational programs.\n\nAn unassuming 96 page novel for middle-school children, Lipman\u2019s\nfirst novel, Harry Stottlemeier\u2019s Discovery, features\nHarry and his 5th grade classmates. Adults occasionally\nenter in, but the primary philosophical work is done by the children.\nHarry and his friends discover several basic concepts and rules of\nAristotelean logic; and they puzzle over questions about the nature of\nthought, mind, causality, reality, knowledge and belief, right and\nwrong, and fairness and unfairness. \n\n\u201cWhat is Harry Stottlemeier\u2019s discovery?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s readers might ask. This question is not\ndirectly answered. However, one candidate stands out among the many\nthings that Harry discovers in the course of exploring questions about\nlogic, knowledge, reality, and the mind. Harry and his classmates are\nasked to write a paper on the topic, \u201cThe Most Interesting Thing\nin the World.\u201d Entitled Thinking, Harry\u2019s essay\nbegins:\n\nTo me, the most interesting thing in the whole world is thinking. I\nknow that lots of other things are also very important and wonderful,\nlike electricity, and magnetism and gravitation. But although we\nunderstand them, they can\u2019t understand us. So thinking must be\nsomething very special.\n\n\nAfter writing several more paragraphs, Harry puts his paper aside.\nLater he thinks, \u201cIn school, we think about math, and we think\nabout spelling, and we think about grammar. But who every heard of\nthinking about thinking?\u201d So, he adds one more sentence to his\npaper: \u201cIf we think about electricity, we can understand it\nbetter, but when we think about thinking, we seem to understand\nourselves better.\u201d\n\nWithout using the word \u2018philosophy,\u2019 either here or\nanywhere else in Harry, Lipman shows Harry engaged in serious\nphilosophical thought, \u201cthinking about thinking.\u201d This, we\nmight say, reveals Harry\u2019s discovery of the joys of\nphilosophical thinking. But there is more. Harry also notices that, as\ninteresting and important as thinking about thinking is, it seems to\nhave no special place in school. Finally, although his paper begins in\nthe first person, it quickly moves to \u2018we\u2019 and focuses on\nwhat might be accomplished with others in the classroom.\n\nOne of the more attractive features of the IAPC approach to Philosophy\nfor Children for many teachers has been that it promotes the idea of\nthe classroom as a \u201ccommunity of inquiry\u201d in which\nstudents openly and respectfully exchange ideas. Each student is\nregarded as having the potential to make valuable contributions to the\ntopics under consideration. Students are encouraged to develop good\nlistening skills, responsiveness to what others say, willingness to\ntry to support one\u2019s own ideas with good reasons, and openness\nto the possibility that one should modify one\u2019s beliefs in light\nof new considerations. In short, the classroom is designed to\nreinforce the student\u2019s potential for reasonableness.\nThis involves more than being able to engage in skillful reasoning. As\nLaurance J. Splitter and Ann Margaret Sharp put it (Splitter and\nSharp, p. 6):\n\nReasonableness is primarily a social disposition: the reasonable\nperson respects others and is prepared to take into account their\nviews and their feelings, to the extent of changing her own mind about\nissues of significance, and consciously allowing her own perspective\nto be changed by others. She is, in other words, willing to be\nreasoned with.\n\n\nTeachers who look favorably on the idea that the classroom should be a\n\u201ccommunity of inquiry\u201d nevertheless may resist the idea\nthat philosophy should be the centerpiece for discussion.\nOther subjects, they might contend, lend themselves well to forming\nthe sort of collaborative learning environment that can fairly be\ncalled a \u201ccommunity of inquiry.\u201d Philosophy for Children\nadvocates, however, need only insist that the sort of inquiry they are\nsupporting be philosophical, rather than being simply shared.\nUnfortunately, Ann Margaret Sharp passed away in 2011. The\ndistinctiveness of the sort of inquiry she and Lipman advocated is\nexplored in some detail in a recent collection of essays by and about\nher that is dedicated to her memory, In Community of Inquiry with\nAnn Margaret Sharp: Philosophy, Childhood and Education (Gregory\nand Laverty, 2017). [This is the first book in Routledge\u2019s\nPhilosophy for Children Founders series of volumes to be edited by\nMaughn Rollins Gregory and Megan Jane Laverty. The second volume is\nGareth Matthews, The Child\u2019s Philosopher, 2022, with\nseveral other books in this series forthcoming.]\n\nIt may be thought that philosophy is, at best, a suitable subject for\nrelatively few students at the pre-college level. Since philosophy\ntraditionally has been taught only at the college level in the United\nStates, it might be thought that it can be suitable for only a small\nsegment of students at pre-college levels\u2014the two percent of\nstudents who are classified as \u201cgifted and talented.\u201d\nHowever, Philosophy for Children programs have shown themselves to be\nremarkably successful in drawing virtually all students in the\nclassroom together in inquiry. Teachers are often surprised, and\npleased, to see many of their most reticent,\n\u201cunderachieving\u201d students actively join in the discussion\nof philosophical ideas.\n\nNevertheless, because they lack background in the formal study of\nphilosophy, many teachers are reluctant to encourage the philosophical\nthinking of their students. Their fears, however, are exaggerated.\nFamiliarity with some of the standard philosophical literature might\nbe desirable, but it is not necessary for bringing Philosophy for\nChildren into the classroom. What is required is the ability to\nfacilitate philosophical discussion. For this, it is much more\nimportant that teachers have some philosophical curiosity themselves\nthan a familiarity with academic philosophical literature. Like their\nstudents, teachers unfamiliar with the discipline of philosophy may\nnevertheless have an aptitude for philosophical thinking\u2014or at\nleast a knack for recognizing when others are engaged in philosophical\nthought.\n\nFacilitating a Philosophy for Children discussion does not mean\ndominating it; it is important for teachers to allow their students to\ndevelop their own ideas. Teachers are not expected to provide, or even\nhave, answers to all the questions. They can share puzzlement with\ntheir students, be open to unexpected but suggestive responses to the\nquestions they and their students pose, and take pleasure in observing\nthe exchanges students have with each other. This means shedding the\ntraditional role of teacher as lecturer and answer-giver. Especially\nfor teachers who are uncertain about what this entails, workshops like\nthose offered by IAPC provide a good introduction to the pedagogy of\nPhilosophy for Children. However, there is a growing number of\norganizations around the world (some of which are mentioned below)\nalso providing assistance for teachers.\n4. Philosophizing With Others?\n\nPhilosophy for Children encourages children to think for\nthemselves at the same time that it encourages them to think\nwith others. However, philosophy is often viewed as more a\nmatter of solitary reflection, perhaps involving exchanges between a\nfew other solitary thinkers\u2014something to which the\n\u201cmasses\u201d are neither privy nor attracted. Perhaps many\nwould claim that this is philosophy at its best. Even if this were so\n(a controversial view), it would not undermine arguments for including\nphilosophy in the K-12 curricula. However esoteric physics and\nmathematics at their best may be, the schools nevertheless recognize\nthe importance of making these subjects available in some form to all\nstudents. Similarly, Philosophy for Children advocates can counter\nthat there should be a place for all students\u2014whether labelled\n\u201cgifted and talented,\u201d \u201cunderachieving,\u201d or\n\u201cordinary\u201d\u2014pursuing philosophical questions\ntogether.\n\nFor this to work, it must be possible for children in the classroom to\nengage in sustained philosophical discussion with others. As already\nnoted, Gareth Matthew\u2019s writings provide ample evidence that\nchildren are capable of having interesting, if not profound,\nphilosophical thoughts. Less obvious, however, is children\u2019s\nability to sustain and develop this with others. Anecdotes of young\nchildren spontaneously sharing a philosophical thought with an\nobservant adult are not sufficient. Matthews\u2019 Dialogues With\nChildren provides good evidence that children can go well beyond\nthis. Other examples of substantial philosophical conversations of\nchildren found in Lone (2012, 2021), McCall (2009), Pritchard (1996,\n2022), Shapiro (2012), and Wartenberg (2009, 2013), among many others,\nshould leave little doubt that children have this ability.\n5. Philosophy For Children Today\n\nIn light of the rapidly expanding international interest in philosophy\nfor children, the International Council for Philosophical Inquiry with\nChildren (ICPIC) was established in 1985. ICPIC continues to sponsor\nan international conference every other year, with hosts including\nAustralia, Austria, Brazil, England, Mexico, Spain (twice), and\nTaiwan.\n\nEven after the passing of IAPC pioneers Matthew Lipman (2010) and Ann\nMargaret Sharp (2011), now led by Maughn Gregory and others, IAPC\nretains a strong presence in ICPIC. However, many ICPIC members now\nhave established their own institutional structures and have developed\ncenters, associations, and programs. In North America, there is the\nNorth American Association of Community of Inquiry (NAACI), which\ngathers every other year (years when ICPIC is not meeting). With\ninitial support from the American Philosophical Association\u2019s\nPre-College Philosophy Committee, PLATO (Philosophy Learning and\nTeaching Organization) was formed. Now a non-profit organization\nsupported by the Squire Family Foundation, PLATO sponsors annual\nmeetings, and in 2022 the University of Washington Center for\nPhilosophy for Children and PLATO were joined. PLATO also sponsors two\nperiodicals: Questions and the online Precollege\nPhilosophy and Public Practice. Australia and New Zealand are\norganized under the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools\nAssociations (FAPSA), which meets annually and publishes Journal\nfor Philosophy in Schools as its official journal (Burgh and\nThornton, 2016). In 1992 the Society for the Advancement of\nPhilosophical Enquiry and Reflection in Education (SAPERE) was\nestablished in Oxford, England. In 2007 England\u2019s Philosophy\nFoundation was established (Worley, 2011). Since 2005, the journal\nPhilosophy and Childhood has been sponsored by ICPIC and the\ngraduate program in education at the State University of Rio De\nJaneiro (UERJ). These organizations, along with many other centers and\nexperienced practitioners around the world, continue to support\ntraining programs for teachers that enable them to introduce thousands\nof children to philosophy, both inside and outside regular classrooms.\n\n\nAlthough there is continued use of IAPC materials, recent years have\nbeen marked by a proliferation of alternative teaching resources and\nways of engaging children in philosophical discussions. For years\nGareth Matthews contributed reviews of children\u2019s stories to\nThinking, then IAPC\u2019s official journal (even though\nIAPC\u2019s own teaching materials made no use of other\nchildren\u2019s literature). This inspired Tom Wartenberg (2009,\n2013) to develop his highly successful pre-college philosophy program\nat Mt. Holyoke College (MA), a prize winning program that is built\naround classic children\u2019s stories. His website offers a wealth\nof materials on children\u2019s literature that are designed to\nprovide guidance for those wishing to pursue philosophy with children.\nKaren Murris was an early objector to Lipman\u2019s resistance to\nusing illustrated materials (Morris, 1992). She and Johana Haynes\noffer a detailed account of the philosophical importance of picture\nbooks (Murris and Haynes, 2012 and Murris, 2016). Peter Worley, head\nof England\u2019s Philosophy Foundation has written several\nstimulating books for teachers and students that make no use of IAPC\nmaterials. Australia\u2019s Phil Cam has assembled a variety of\nstories suitable for philosophical use with children. In short, there\nis a rapidly growing list of resources that show great promise for\nengaging children in philosophical discussions. (See, for example,\nDeHaan et al. 1995; Fisher 1998; Keen 1997; Lewis and Chandley 2012;\nLone 2012 & 2021; McCall 2009; Murris 1992, 2016; Sprod 2001, and\nWhite 2000). Questions: Philosophy for Young People, a\nperiodical sponsored by the American Philosophical Association\u2019s\nPre-College Philosophy Committee, features young people\u2019s\nwritings on special philosophical topics. The first issue (Spring\n2001) focused on children\u2019s rights.\n\nFortunately, the internet makes it possible to keep up reasonably well\nwith the latest developments around the world and communicate quickly\nwith other educators interested in Philosophy for Children.\nUnfortunately, many of these websites seem to be short-lived. However,\nsee the Internet Resources section below for a list of websites that\nare reliable and which provide links to other useful sites.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"BooArt\">Books and Articles</a>", "<a name=\"Per\">Periodicals</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"BooArt\">Books and Articles</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Astington, Janet Wilde, 1993, <em>The Child\u2019s Discovery of\nthe Mind</em> Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.", "Burgh, Gilbert and Simone Thornton, 2016, \u201cPhilosophy Goes\nto School in Australia: A History 1982\u20132016,\u201d <em>Journal\nof Philosophy in Schools</em>, 3(1): 59\u201383.", "Burgh, Gilbert and Simone Thornton (eds.), 2019, <em>Philosophical\nInquiry With Children: The Development of an Inquiring Society in\nAustralia</em>, New York: Routledge.", "Cam, Philip, 1995, <em>Thinking Together: Philosophical Inquiry\nfor the Classroom</em>, Sydney: Primary English Teaching Association\nand Hale &amp; Iremonger.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1993 (1994, 1997), <em>Thinking Stories 1,\n2, and 3: Philosophical Inquiry for Children</em>, Sydney: Hare &amp;\nIremonger.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006, <em>20 Thinking Tools</em>,\nCamberwell, Vic.: Australian Council for Educational Research.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2012, <em>Teaching Ethics in Schools</em>,\nCamberwell, Vic.: Australian Council for Educational Research.", "Costello, Patrick J.M., 2000, <em>Thinking Skills and Early\nChildhood Education</em>, London: David Fulton Publishers.", "Costello, Peter R.
