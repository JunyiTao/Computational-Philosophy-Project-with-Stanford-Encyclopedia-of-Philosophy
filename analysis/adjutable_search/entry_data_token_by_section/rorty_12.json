Rorty in the Conversations of Philosophy\n\nThe wide scope of Rorty\u2019s metaphilosophical deconstruction of\nrepresentationalism in PMN, together with a penchant for uncashed\nmetaphor and swift, broad-stroke historical narrative of the sort\ndisplayed in CP, earned Rorty a sturdy reputation as an\nanti-philosopher\u2019s philosopher. At the same time, however, as\nhis reputation within the dominant cultures of analytic philosophy was\nwaning in the wake of PMN, his writings from the 1980s in particular\ngained a significant readership beyond the confines of the profession.\nStill, while his academic engagement certainly ranged far beyond the\nconfines of analytic philosophy, it would be wrong to say that Rorty\nturned his back on that enterprise. The relationship, as we shall see\n\u2013 though both complicated and shifting over the decades \u2013\nhas continued to develop as Rorty\u2019s work is appropriated by new\ngenerations of readers.\n",
