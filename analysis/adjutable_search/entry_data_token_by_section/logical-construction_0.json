    "main_text": "Honest Toil\n1. Honest Toil\n\nThe earliest construction on Russell\u2019s 1924 list is the famous\n\u201cFrege/Russell definition\u201d of numbers as classes of\nequinumerous classes from 1901 (Russell 1993, 320). The definition\nfollows the example of the definitions of the notions of limit and\ncontinuity that were proposed for the calculus in the preceding\ncentury. Russell did not rest content with adopting the Peano-Dedekind\naxioms as the basis for the theory of the natural numbers and then\nshowing how the properties of the numbers could be logically deduced\nfrom those axioms. Instead, he defined the basic notions of\n\u201cnumber\u201d , \u201csuccessor\u201d and \u201c0\u201d and\nproposed to show, with carefully chosen definitions of their basic\nnotions in terms of logical notions, that those axioms could be\nderived from principles of logic alone. \n\nRussell defined natural numbers as classes of equinumerous classes.\nAny pair, a class with two members, can be put into a one to\none correspondence with any other, hence all pairs are \nequinumerous. The number two is then identified with the\nclass of all pairs. The relation between equinumerous classes when\nthere is such a one to one mapping relating them is called\n\u201csimilarity\u201d. Similarity is defined solely in terms of\nlogical notions of quantifiers and identity. With the natural numbers\nso defined, Peano axioms can be derived by logical means alone. After\nnatural numbers, Russell adds \u201cseries, ordinal numbers and real\nnumbers\u201d (1924, 166) to his list of constructions, and then\nconcludes with the construction of matter.\n\nRussell credits A. N. Whitehead with the solution to the problem of\nthe relation of sense data to physics that he adopted in 1914:\n\n\nI have been made aware of the importance of this problem by my friend\nand collaborator Dr Whitehead, to whom are due almost all the\ndifferences between the views advocated here and those suggested in\nThe Problems of Philosophy. I owe to him the definition of\npoints, and the suggestion for the treatment of instants and\n\u201cthings,\u201d and the whole conception of the world of physics\nas a construction rather than an inference. (Russell\n1914b, vi)\n\n\nIt is only later, in an essay in which Russell reflected on his\nphilosophy that he also described his earlier logical proposals as\n\u201clogical constructions.\u201d The first specific formulation of\nthis method of replacing inference with construction as a general\nmethod in philosophy is in the essay \u201cLogical\nAtomism\u201d:\n\n\nOne very important heuristic maxim which Dr. Whitehead and I found, by\nexperience, to be applicable in mathematical logic, and have since\napplied to various other fields, is a form of Occam\u2019s Razor.\nWhen some set of supposed entities has neat logical properties, it\nturns out, in a great many instances, that the supposed entities can\nbe replaced by purely logical structures composed of entities which\nhave not such neat properties. In that case, in interpreting a body of\npropositions hitherto believed to be about the supposed entities, we\ncan substitute the logical structures without altering any of the\ndetail of the body of propositions in question. This is an economy,\nbecause entities with neat logical properties are always inferred, and\nif the propositions in which they occur can be interpreted without\nmaking this inference, the ground for the inference fails, and our\nbody of propositions is secured against the need of a doubtful step.\nThe principle may be stated in the form: \u2018Whenever possible,\nsubstitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to\nunknown entities\u2019. (Russell 1924, 160)\n\n\nRussell was referring to logical constructions in this frequently\nquoted passage from his Introduction to Mathematical\nPhilosophy. He objects to introducing entities with implicit\ndefinitions, that is, as being those things that obey certain axioms\nor \u201cpostulates\u201d:\n\n\nThe method of \u2018postulating\u2019 what we want has many\nadvantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest\ntoil. Let us leave them to others and proceed with our honest toil.\n(Russell 1919, 71)\n\n\nHe charges that we need a demonstration that there are any objects\nwhich satisfy those axioms. The \u201ctoil\u201d here is the work of\nformulating definitions of the numbers so that they can be shown to\nsatisfy the axioms using logical inference alone.\n\nThe description of logical constructions as \u201cincomplete\nsymbols\u201d derives from the use of contextual definitions that\nprovide an analysis or substitute for each sentence in which a defined\nsymbol may occur. The definition does not give an explicit definition,\nsuch as an equation with the defined expression on one side that is\nidentified with a definiendum on the other, or a universal\nstatement giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the\napplication of the term in isolation. The connection between being a\nfiction and expressed by an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d can be\nseen in Russell\u2019s constructions of finite cardinal and ordinal\nnumbers by means of the theory of classes. That\n\u201cno-classes\u201d theory, via the contextual definitions for\nclass terms, makes all the numbers \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d,\nand so numbers can be seen as \u201clogical fictions\u201d.\n\nThe notions of construction and logical fiction appear together in\nthis account from Russell\u2019s \u201cPhilosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d lectures:\n\n\nYou find that a certain thing which has been set up as a metaphysical\nentity can either be assumed dogmatically to be real, and then you\nwill have no possible argument either for its reality or against its\nreality; or, instead of doing that, you can construct a logical\nfiction having the same formal properties, or rather having formally\nanalogous formal properties to those of the supposed metaphysical\nentity and itself composed of empirically given things, and the\nlogical fiction can be substituted for your supposed metaphysical\nentity and will fulfill all the scientific purposes that anyone can\ndesire. (Russell 1918, 144)\n\n\nIncomplete symbols, descriptions, classes and logical fictions are\nidentified with each other and then with the \u201cfamiliar objects\nof daily life\u201d in the following passage from earlier in the\nlectures:\n\n\nThere are a great many other sorts of incomplete symbols besides\ndescriptions. There are classes\u2026 and relations taken in\nextension, and so on. Such aggregations of symbols are really the same\nas what I call \u201clogical fictions\u201d, and they embrace\npractically all the familiar objects of daily life: tables, chairs,\nPiccadilly, Socrates, and so on. Most of them are either classes, or\nseries, or series of classes. In any case they are all incomplete\nsymbols, i.e. they are aggregations that only have a meaning in use\nand do not have any meaning in themselves. (Russell 1918, 122)\n\n\nIn what follows these various features of logical constructions will\nbe disentangled. The result appears to be a connected series of\nanalyses sharing at least a family resemblance with each other. The\ncommon feature is that in each case some formal or \u201cneat\u201d\nproperties of objects that had to be postulated in axioms before could\nnow be derived as logical consequences of definitions. The replaced\nentities are variously \u201cfictions\u201d, \u201cincomplete\nsymbols\u201d or simply \u201cconstructions\u201d depending on the\nform that the definitions take.\n",
