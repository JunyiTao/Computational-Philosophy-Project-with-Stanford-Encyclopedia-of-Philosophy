    "main_text": "Kuhn\u2019s Early Account of Scientific Revolutions || Revolution or Evolution?\n3.4 Revolution or Evolution?\n\nAt the end of Structure, Kuhn drew an analogy between the\ndevelopment of science and evolutionary biology. This was surprising,\nsince \u2018evolution\u2019 is commonly employed as a contrast term\nto \u2018revolution\u2019. Kuhn\u2019s main point was that\nevolution ramifies rather than progressing toward a final goal, yet\nits degree of specialization through speciation can be regarded as a\nsort of progress, a progress from a historically existing\nbenchmark rather than a progress toward a preordained,\nspeculative goal. So specialization is an indicator of progress. As\nfor revolutions, they correspond to macromutations.\n\nThe process described in Section XII as the resolution of revolutions\nis the selection by conflict within the scientific community of the\nfittest way to practice future science. The net result of a sequence\nof such revolutionary selections, separated by periods of normal\nresearch, is the wonderfully adapted set of instruments we call modern\nscientific knowledge. Successive stages in that developmental process\nare marked by an increase in articulation and specialization. And the\nentire process may have occurred, as we now suppose biological\nevolution did, without benefit of a set goal\u2026 . [1970, 172f]\n\n\nAt the time, it was striking that Kuhn compared revolutionary\ntransitions, rather than normal scientific developments, with\nevolutionary change. It seems clear that he did not consider\nrevolution and evolution to be mutually incompatible. But keep in mind\nthat, for him, normal science represents periods of stasis, whereas\nrevolutions are short, highly creative periods that more closely\nresemble the exploration by random trial and error (p. 87) that we\nassociate with biological evolution. Examined on a minute time scale,\nhowever, normal science arguably also involves a (more constrained)\nvariation and selection process, as scientific practitioners search\nfor ways to articulate the paradigm. So, given the inevitability of\nevolution under such conditions, Kuhn\u2019s treatment of normal\nscience would appear to be too static. The important point here is\nthat, in Kuhn\u2019s view revolution and evolution are compatible\nwhen considered on the correct time scales (see Wray 2011 and\nKuukkanen 2012). Examined from afar, revolutions are simply the more\nnoteworthy episodes in the evolution of the sciences. Examined up\nclose, they (like discoveries in general for Kuhn) have a detailed\nstructure that is evolutionary, even something as revolutionary as the\nquantum theory (Kuhn 1978).\n\nBut how, then, the reader is entitled to ask, can Kuhn accommodate the\nsharp discontinuities that he advertised in chapter X of the book? We\ncannot equate revolutions simply with speciation in Darwin\u2019s own\nsense, given that Darwin\u2019s favorite mechanism of speciation was\nanagenesis, not cladogenesis\u2014just the long-term gradual\nevolution within a single line rather than the splitting of lines.\nInterestingly, the later Kuhn will opt for cladogenesis.\n\nAs many commentators have pointed out, the theory of punctuated\nequilibrium of Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (1992) raises the\nquestion of evolution versus revolution, now precisely in the\nbiological (paleontological) context. In fact, Gould and Eldredge were\nthemselves influenced by Kuhn, whom Gould once described as \u201ca\ndear friend\u201d; but they denied that they had deliberately\nfashioned themselves as Kuhnian revolutionaries (Gould 1997). Gould\nand Eldredge end their later review article on punctuated equilibrium\nby remarking:\n\n[C]ontemporary science has massively substituted notions of\nindeterminacy, historical contingency, chaos and punctuation for\nprevious convictions about gradual, progressive, predictable\ndeterminism. These transitions have occurred in field after field;\nKuhn\u2019s celebrated notion of scientific revolutions is, for\nexample, a punctuation theory for the history of scientific ideas.\n[1993, 227]\n\n\nHere, as with Kuhn, those who resist Gould\u2019s attempt to sound so\nrevolutionary as to be contrary to Darwin\u2019s phyletic gradualism\nnote that it is only on a geological timescale that such developments\nas the Cambrian explosion appear to be episodic. When examined on the\ntimescale of the biological generations of the life forms in question,\nthe development is evolutionary\u2014more rapid evolution than during\nother periods, to be sure, but still evolutionary.\n\nStuart Kauffman (1993) and Brian Goodwin (1994) defended\nreorganization in the form of self-organization as the primary\nmacro-biological mechanism, with evolutionary adaptation adding only\nthe finishing touches. Gould and Richard Lewontin had raised this\npossibility in their famous paper of 1979, \u201cThe Spandrels of San\nMarco and the Panglossian Paradigm.\u201d Applied to the development\nof science, this view implies that revolutions determine the overall\nshape, while ordinary scientific work applies the adaptive\nmicroevolution. Meanwhile, Michael Ruse (1989) defended the view that\nthe Darwinian paradigm (with its emphasis on function and adaptation)\nand the punctuated equilibrium paradigm (with its emphasis on Germanic\nideas of form and internal constraints) are complementary.\n\nDavid Hull ended his book, Science as a Process (1988), with\nthe remark that the book can be regarded as an attempt to fulfill both\nKuhn\u2019s and Toulmin\u2019s ambitions to provide a evolutionary\naccount of scientific development. Hull\u2019s is the most\nthoroughgoing attempt to date to provide an evolutionary account of\nscientific practice, at least in a specific field. However, nothing\nlike Kuhnian paradigms, normal science, and revolutions are to be\nfound in Hull\u2019s book, and this was deliberate on his part.\nWhereas Kuhn originally said that paradigms correspond one-to-one with\nscientific communities, Hull rejected Kuhn\u2019s idea of a\nscientific community as too loose. A scientific community, he said,\ndoes not consist of people who merely happen to agree on certain\nthings (anymore than the members of a species are individuals who\nhappen to share a set of traits). Mere consensus is not enough.\nRather, communities are tightly causally linked in the right sorts of\nways, just as species are. There is no community of biologists or even\nof evolutionary biologists but only a patchwork of cliques. It is\nhere, locally, that the seeds of innovation are sown, most of which\nare weeded out in a selective process by the larger group of\nspecialists. Hull\u2019s is a story of the socio-cultural evolution\nof science without revolution.\n",
