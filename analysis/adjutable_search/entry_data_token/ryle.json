Through this work, Ryle is thought to have\naccomplished two major tasks. First, he was seen to have put the final\nnail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism. Second, he is thought to have\nargued on behalf of, and suggested as dualism\u2019s replacement, the\ndoctrine known as philosophical (and sometimes\nanalytical) behaviourism. Sometimes known as an\n\u201cordinary language\u201d, sometimes as an\n\u201canalytic\u201d philosopher, Ryle\u2014even when mentioned in\nthe same breath as Wittgenstein and his followers\u2014is considered\nto be on a different, somewhat idiosyncratic (and difficult to\ncharacterise), philosophical track.\n\nPhilosophical behaviourism has long been rejected; what was worth\nkeeping has been appropriated by the philosophical doctrine of\nfunctionalism, which is the most widely accepted view in philosophy of\nmind today. It is a view that is thought to have saved the\n\u201creality\u201d of the mental from the\n\u201celiminativist\u201d or \u201cfictionalist\u201d tendencies\nof behaviourism while acknowledging the insight (often attributed to\nRyle) that the mental is importantly related to behavioural output or\nresponse (as well as to stimulus or input). According to a reasonably\ncharitable assessment, the best of Ryle\u2019s lessons has long been\nassimilated while the problematic has been discarded. If there are\nconsiderations still brewing from the 1930s and 40s that would\nthreaten the orthodoxy in contemporary philosophy of mind, these lie\nsomewhere in work of Wittgenstein and his followers\u2014not in\nRyle.\n\nBut the view just outlined, though widespread, represents a\nfundamental misapprehension of Ryle\u2019s work. First, Cartesianism\nis dead in only one of its ontological aspects: substance dualism may\nwell have been repudiated but property dualism still claims a number\nof contemporary defenders. The problem of finding a place for the\nmental in the physical world, of accommodating the causal power of the\nmental, and of accounting for the phenomenal aspects of consciousness\nare all live problems in the philosophy of mind today because they\nshare some of the doctrine\u2019s ontological, epistemological, and\nsemantic assumptions.\n\nSecond, and importantly, Ryle is not a philosophical\nbehaviourist\u2014at least he does not subscribe to any of the main\ntenets associated with that doctrine as it is known today. One may be\nconfused by this if one is also confused about Ryle\u2019s conception\nof philosophy. Although there is some truth in identifying him as an\nanalytic philosopher\u2014he announces (1932, 61) that \u201cthe\nsole and whole function of philosophy\u201d is philosophical\nanalysis\u2014this is likely to be misunderstood today if one thinks\nthat the proper goal of philosophy (attainable if not in practice at\nleast in ideals) is definitional analysis. It is this that encourages\nthe association with behaviourism (in at least one of its many senses)\nBut Ryle was not an analytical philosopher in this sense. True, Ryle\nacknowledges the influence of Moore\u2019s emphasis on common sense\n(and thus on ordinary language); true, he takes himself to be pursuing\nthe type of philosophical investigation (exemplified by\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions) that involves uncovering the\nlogical form of grammatically misleading expressions. But it is\nimportant to take account of the differences that separate Ryle from\nthe early Moore and Russell for it is their conception of philosophy\nthat has been inherited by many of us working within the\n\u201canalytic\u201d tradition in philosophy today. That is the\nthird point. For Ryle does not believe in meanings (concepts\nor propositions) as these have been traditionally construed (as stable\nobjects or rules, the grasp of which is logically prior to, and thus\nmay be used to explain, the use of expressions). Indeed, Ryle\u2019s\nconception of philosophy was not fundamentally different from that of\nWittgenstein. Ryle sets out in print as early as 1932 a philosophical\nagenda that prefigures the published work of the later Wittgenstein;\nthe \u201celasticity of significance\u201d and \u201cinflections of\nmeaning\u201d Ryle finds in most expressions appear to be the family\nof structures, more or less related, noticed by Wittgenstein; and\nRyle\u2019s attack on the \u201cintellectualist legend\u201d shares\nWittgenstein\u2019s concern to understand a\nproper\u2014non-exalted\u2014place for rules in an explanation of\nvarious philosophically interesting achievements. In spite of the fact\nthat some of Wittgenstein\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were\ndismissive of Ryle\u2019s\n work,[1]\n the best way to understand Ryle is to see him, if not as following in\nWittgenstein\u2019s footsteps, then as walking some stretches of\nphilosophical terrain down a parallel path.\n", "toc": [{"#Bio": "1.

Biography\n\nGilbert Ryle was born in Brighton, Sussex, England on 19 August 1900.\nOne of ten children, he came from a prosperous family and enjoyed a\nliberal and stimulating childhood and adolescence. His father was a\ngeneral practitioner but had keen interests in philosophy and\nastronomy that he passed on to his children and an impressive library\nwhere Ryle enjoyed being an \u201comnivorous reader\u201d (Ryle,\n1970, 1). Educated at Brighton College (where later in life he would\nreturn as a governor) Ryle went to Queen\u2019s College, Oxford in\n1919 initially to study Classics, but he was quickly drawn to\nPhilosophy, graduating in 1924 with first-class honours in the new\nModern Greats School of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. While not\nparticularly sporting, his undergraduate studies were relieved by\nrowing for his college eight, of which he was captain, and he was good\nenough to have trials for the University boat. After his graduation in\n1924 he was appointed to a lectureship in Philosophy at Christ Church\nCollege and a year later became tutor. He would remain at Oxford for\nhis entire academic career until his retirement in 1968; in 1945 he\nwas elected to the Waynflete Chair of Metaphysical Philosophy. With\nthe outbreak of war Ryle volunteered. He was commissioned in the Welsh\nGuards, serving in intelligence, and by the end of the War had been\npromoted to the rank of Major. He became the Editor of Mind\nafter G.E. Moore\u2019s retirement in 1947; a post he held until\n1971. Ryle was unstinting in his advice and encouragement to\ngenerations of students. With colleagues he was \u201ctolerant (and)\nuncensorious\u201d (Warnock, xiv), but in philosophical debate he\ncould turn into a formidable opponent, expressing an intense dislike\nof pomposity, pretence and jargon (Urmson, 271; Gallop, 228). He was\nalso ever ready to challenge both the excessive veneration paid by\nothers to Plato and Classical authors as well as the philosophical\npositions held by such contemporary colleagues as Collingwood in\nOxford or Anderson in Australia. He befriended Wittgenstein whose\nwork, if not his effect on colleagues and students, he greatly\nadmired. \u201cOutstandingly friendly (and) sociable\u201d (Warnock,\nxiv), he is remembered as an entertaining conversationalist. Despite\nhaving turned away from literary studies during his first year at\nOxford, sensing he had little aptitude for them, and even though he\nread little other than the novels of Jane Austen (about whom he wrote\nauthoritatively) and P. G. Wodehouse, the style of Ryle\u2019s\nwriting is often literary and instantly recognizable even after a few\nsentences (Urmson, 271; Mabbott, 223). A confirmed bachelor, he lived\nafter his retirement with his twin sister Mary in the Oxfordshire\nvillage of Islip. Gardening and walking gave him immense pleasure, as\ndid his pipe. He died on 6 October 1976 at Whitby in Yorkshire after a\nday\u2019s walking on the moors. \u201cPhilosophy irradiated his\nwhole life\u201d (Mabbott, 224). He is reputed to have said that the\nonly completed portrait of him made him look like a \u201cdrowned\nGerman General\u201d (Mabbott, 224).\n2. Philosophy as Cartography\n\nWhen Ryle became a young don in the 1920s, philosophers could no\nlonger \u201cpretend that philosophy differed from physics, chemistry\nand biology by studying mental as opposed to material phenomena\u201d\n(1971b, vii). Although the turn away from psychologism was laudable,\nphilosophers succumbed instead to what Ryle considered to be a\nregrettable temptation to look for Objects which were neither mental\nnor material. Such objects were to be for philosophy what beetles and\nbutterflies are for entomology:\n\nPlatonic Forms, Propositions, Intentional Objects, Logical\nObjects \u2026 [and even] Sense Data were recruited to appease our\nprofessional hankerings to have a subject matter of our own (1971b,\nvii).\n\n\nRyle\u2019s campaign against the tendency of philosophers to\n\u201chypostasise their own terms of art\u201d lasted throughout his\ncareer. Even his very first articles carried the\n\u201cOccamizing\u201d message that \u201c[p]hilosophical problems\nare problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary\nsort about special entities\u201d (1971b, vii; these early articles\ninclude 1929, 1930a, 1933a, and 1933b).\n\nInstead, think of a philosopher, by analogy, as a cartographer.\nAccording to Ryle, competent speakers of language are to a philosopher\nwhat an ordinary villager is to a mapmaker. A local villager knows his\nway by wont and without reflection to the village church, to the town\nhall, to the shops and back home again from the personal point of view\nof one who lives there. But, asked to draw or to consult a map of his\nvillage, he is faced with learning a new and different sort of task:\none that employs compass bearing and units of measurement. What was\nfirst understood in the personal terms of local snapshots now has to\nbe considered in the completely general terms of the cartographer. The\nvillager\u2019s knowledge by wont, enabling him to lead a stranger\nfrom place to place, is a different skill from one requiring him to\ntell the stranger, in perfectly general and neutral terms, how to get\nto any of the places, or indeed, how to understand these places in\nrelation to those of other villages (1962a, 441).\n\nWe are like the villager with respect to our employment of words and\nphrases. Knowledge by wont of the use of expressions and of concrete\nideas is something everybody learns in the course of growing up\nspeaking and understanding a language: \u201ctheir \u2018logical\ngeography\u2019 is taught by one\u2019s daily walks\u201d (1945,\n207). So too do people know how to operate with ordinary,\nnon-technical, and even semi-technical and technical expressions as\nwell as with relatively concrete and some abstract ideas without being\nable to codify the rules, permissions, or sanctions that govern their\noperations.\n\nNow, almost every word or phrase we use contributes to what we say in\na way such that had it been replaced by a word or phrase with a\ndifferent significance, it would have had different \u201cimplication\nthreads\u201d:\n\nIt would have been a different statement, different in having\ndifferent implications, in requiring different tests for truth or\nfalsehood, in being compatible and incompatible with different\naffiliated statements, in being evidence for or against different\ncorollaries, and so on. (1962a, 442\u20133)\n\n\nTo the extent that I understand what I am saying, I understand the\nparticular differences that the expression contributes to the\nstatements, questions, commands, etc. that I make with it. In making\neveryday (non-philosophical) statements, or in asking ordinary factual\nquestions, or in giving concrete, practical advice I am like, Ryle\nsays, the villager who simply walks to his destination without having\nto think about what he is doing or turning back in his tracks. But\neven in making everyday, non-philosophical statements, I employ a\nplurality of expressions. The implication threads of some of these\nexpressions may \u201cpull against\u201d the implication threads of\nothers. For example,\n\n\u2026 I might truly and intelligibly describe a weary sailor in a\nstorm as having toiled voluntarily, although reluctantly; and then I\nfind myself in a perplexity. For I seem to be saying that he toiled\nnot under compulsion but because he volunteered to do it, despite the\nfact that he did not want to do it. The natural implication threads of\n\u2018voluntarily\u2019 seem to pull away from the natural\nimplication threads of \u2018reluctantly\u2019. (1962a, 443)\n\n\nTo resolve this complexity it is not enough that I be familiar with\nthe separate contributions of the two adverbs. To resolve it, I need\nto be satisfied that the conflict is only apparent. I am confronted\nwith a conceptual problem that requires that I be able to say\nhow the implication threads of the one bear on the implication threads\nof the other. This requires abstracting from or ignoring the\nparticular reference to this sailor or that storm; it requires that I\noperate upon general notions of actions, motive, preference,\nstrength of desires, choice and so on.\n\nThe most philosophically interesting questions arise for those cases\nof conflict that present themselves again and again. We speak in the\nsame breath of a responsible human agent who is, and acts, in a world\nthat is a field of physical, chemical, and biological causes and\neffects. \u201cMen must, we feel, be free; yet they\nmust, we feel, be amenable to prediction and explanation.\nTheir actions cannot be mechanical. Yet also they cannot be\nunmechanical\u201d (1962a, 444). From the point of view of laymen and\nscientists who are actually exploring the world, we find out what\nthere is by perceiving it; yet from the point of view of the inquirer\ninto the mechanism of perception, what we perceive never coincides\nwith the world (1954, 2). The reconciliation of these convictions, an\nanswer to the question how this could be, belongs to\nphilosophy.\n\nWe have now to operate upon what we ordinarily operate\nreadily and unquestioningly with. We now need the theory of\nour daily practice, the geography of our daily walks. When two or\ntwenty familiar implication threads seem to pull across and against\none another, it is no longer enough to be able unperplexedly to follow\nalong each one by itself. We need to be able to state their\ndirections, their limits and their interlockings; to think\nsystematically about what normally we merely think\ncompetently with. (1962a, 444)\n\n3. Type Trespasses and Systematic Ambiguity \n\nIf the \u201clogical geography\u201d of natural language expressions\nis taught by our daily walks, the same cannot be said about\nphilosophers\u2019 attempts to theorise about the geography. For when\nwe treat philosophical problems as \u201cproblems of an ordinary sort\nabout special entities\u201d, or \u201chypostasise our own terms of\nart\u201d, we tend to commit type-errors or category mistakes which\nrender our theories absurd. \n\n\nWhen a sentence is (not true or false but) nonsensical or absurd,\nthough its vocabulary is conventional and its grammatical construction\nis regular, we say that it is absurd because at least one ingredient\nexpression in it is not of the right type to be coupled or to be\ncoupled in that way with the other ingredient expression or\nexpressions in it. Such sentences, we may say, commit type-trespasses\nor break type-rules. (1938, 178)\n\n\nThe expressions \u201ccategory\u201d and \u201ctype\u201d are\nthemselves formal ones, and Ryle insists that \u201cthere is (and can\nbe) no finite number of categories or types\u201d. Ryle\u2019s\nidentification of type-errors or category mistakes is intimately tied\nto the production of nonsensical or absurd sentences; and\n\u201cdelineating a category is a matter of marking a\nlogico-conceptual space of sense-making rather than a factual domain\nof truths\u2026\u201d (B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m and Gustafasson 2017, 48).\nRyle\u2019s introduction of \u201cproposition-factor\u201d (as an\ningredient expression) will, as he points out, tend to be misleading\nas soon as one inquires about the nature of \u201cfactor\u201d and\nfail to treat this expression as an abstraction or discriminable\nfeature of what is integrally said or integrally thought (see section\n4, below). \n\nPhilosophical theories that commit type-trespasses (such as\nPlato\u2019s early theory of Forms and Russell\u2019s introduction\nof Classes and his theory of Types) require demonstrations of the\nregresses and contradictions that ensue (as demonstrated,\nrespectively, by Plato\u2019s own criticism of his early work in\nParmenides and Wittgenstein\u2019s criticism of Russell in\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus). Untangling may also be\nnecessary for individual sentences that commit a breach of logical\nsyntax (for example, \u201c\u2019Heterological\u2019 is\nheterological\u201d or \u201cThis sentence is false\u201d). Some\ntype-mistakes are obvious: such as (adapting an example from The\nConcept of Mind) the inference from \u201cShe came home in a\nChevrolet and a flood of tears\u201d to \u201cShe came home in two\nthings\u201d. As we shall see below, the category mistake Ryle\nidentifies in \u201cThere is a mind and a body\u201d or \u201cthere\nis a mind or a body\u201d is less obvious. For it takes a fair bit of\nuntangling to show that \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cbody\u201d are\ndifferent logical or grammatical types; a fact which renders the\nassertion of either the conjunction or the disjunction nonsensical.\n\n\nCrucially, identifying type-errors requires being alert to the\npervasive or \u201csystematic\u201d ambiguity of our natural\nlanguage expressions. For, \n\n\n[a] given word will, in different sorts of context, express ideas of\nan indefinite range of differing logical types and, therefore, with\ndifferent logical powers. And what is true of single words is also\ntrue of complex expressions and of grammatical constructions. (1945,\n206)\n\n\nThus, even if we were to put aside ambiguity of the kind that\nlogicians ignore (Ryle calls such expressions \u201cpun\nwords\u201d), we are faced with another sort of elasticity of\nsignificance which characterizes the use, according to Ryle,\n\u201cnot of a few but of most or of all\nexpressions\u2026\u201d(1945, 205). Unlike ambiguous words such as\n\u201cbank\u201d, \u201creport\u201d or \u201cstud\u201d, the\ninflections of meaning to which most of our expressions are\nsusceptible nonetheless have affinities: the ideas expressed by these\nexpressions in their various uses are \u201cintimately\nconnected\u201d with each other; they are \u201cdifferent\ninflections of the same root\u201d (1945, 206). The paraphrases and\ntranslations of these expressions will normally have \u201ca\nprecisely similar\u201d flexibility. This means that if we were to\nparaphrase the expression as it is used in one context in order to\nmake clear its implication threads in that context, we can expect the\nparaphrase, like the original expression, to express a different idea\nin a different context. To use a contemporary idiom, the paraphrase,\nlike the original expression, is \u201ccontext-sensitive\u201d.\n\nThe philosophical task Ryle recommends involves tracing the\ninflections of significance that are conveyed by expressions with a\ncommon root in their various employments. On this way of looking at\nit, it is not wrong to say that the philosopher studies or\ninvestigates the idea or the concept of, say, justice. But putting it\nthis way may be misleading if it obscures the fact that the logical\nforce of the relevant expression \u201cis just\u201d) may change\nwith the context in which it is used. Again, Ryle thought this to be\nso for most single words and complex expressions and not only\nthe ambiguous \u201cpun-words\u201d. For, \u201c[u]nnoticed\nsystematic ambiguities are a common source of type-confusions and\nphilosophic problems\u201d (1945, 207).\n\nSystematic ambiguity affects not only single words and complex\nexpressions. It affects grammatical constructions as well. Since\nexpressions of the same grammatical constructions function to express\nthoughts of multifarious logical sorts, those starting to philosophise\n(those operating upon ideas and not merely with them) \u201ctend to\nbe blind to the fact that different ideas have different logical\npowers\u2026\u201d (1945, 200). Assimilation of the functions or\nuses can lead to trouble, and this can be shown by eliciting\ncontradictions, absurdities, and paradoxes. To return to where we\nbegan:\n\nThe inevitable consequence is that na\u00efve intellectual operations\nwith those ideas lead directly to logically intolerable results.\nConcepts of different types cannot be coerced into similar logical\nconduct. Some sort of contradiction arises from the attempt and this,\nin fortunate cases, compels the thinker to turn back in his tracks and\ntry to change his treatment of the outraged concept. (1945,\n 201)[2]\n\n4. Concepts, Propositions, and Meaning\n\nThe implications of this view for the concept of meaning or for\nnominalisations of the verb \u2018to mean\u2019 are important. We\nare not at all likely to be misled by expressions of the form\n\u2018x means what y means.\u2019 But when we use\nthe expression quasi-descriptively, as in \u2018The meaning of\nx is the same as the meaning of y\u2019 or\n\u2018The meaning of x is doubtful\u2019 we are liable to\nbe misled into thinking that we are referring to some queer new\nobject. Ryle generalises the point to suggest that all the mistaken\ndoctrines of concepts, ideas, terms, judgment, contents, and the like\nderive from the fallacy\n\nthat there must be something referred to by such expressions\nas \u2018the meaning of the word (phrase or sentence)\nx\u2019 [which is analogous to the policeman] who is\nreferred to by the descriptive phrase \u2018Our village policeman is\nfond of football\u2019. (1932, 56)\n\n\nThe meaning of an expression is not an entity denoted by it and not\nthe nominee of any thing. It would be a related mistake to\nsuppose, Ryle tells us, that a particular concept is precisely\nindicated by a particular expression: as if the idea of equality could\nbe identified as that for which the word \u2018equality\u2019 stands\n(1945, 206). For Ryle, agreeing here with Wittgenstein,\n\u201cconcepts are not things that are there crystallised in a\nsplendid isolation\u201d; rather\n\nthey are discriminable features, but not detachable atoms, of what is\nintegrally said or integrally thought. They are not detachable parts\nof, but distinguishable contributions to, the unitary senses of\ncomplete sentences. To examine them is to examine the live force of\nthings that we actually say. It is to examine them not in retirement,\nbut doing their co-operative work. (1962b, 185)\n [3]\n\n\nThe idea that expressions have meaning insofar as they stand for\nthings should be rejected. Indeed, some expressions denote (in one of\na variety of ways) because they are significant. To learn the meaning\nof an expression is to learn to operate correctly with it; more like\nlearning a piece of drill than like coming across a previously\nunencountered object (1957, 365).\n\nConcepts are instead to be understood as that which is conveyed by a\nword or phrase independently of the language (English or French) in\nwhich the word is written or spoken. Although we tend to make use of\nabstract nouns to talk about that which is conveyed by various words,\nthis should not mislead us. Russell and Moore may have described their\npursuits as the investigation of supra-mundane entities, but this was\nnot, claims Ryle, the way they or any other philosopher set about\ntheir task. Aristotle, for example, when studying Plato\u2019s\naccount of Pleasure, did not \u201cstare hard\u201d at an entity or\nEssence designated by this abstract noun: \u201cInstead he rightly\nconsidered what we are asserting or denying in concreto when\nwe say that someone did or did not enjoy the concert; or that someone\nenjoys this piece of music more than that piece\u201d (1962b, 185).\nUnlike the abstract noun \u201cPleasure\u201d, the live verb is\nmaking specific contributions to sense. Similarly, an analysis of the\nconcept, say, of existence \u201ccannot consist just in acts\nof contemplating a rarefied object, withdrawn, like a coin in a\nmuseum, from its native commercial transactions\u201d (1962b,\n185).\n5. Ordinary Language\n\nRyle is often described as an ordinary language philosopher or as\nrecommending that philosophy should concern itself with the ordinary\nuse of language. In a certain sense this is apt; in another it is\nnot.\n\nPhilosophers may well study the stock use of various expressions. But\nthese may be highly technical or semi-technical expressions, as well\nas vernacular ones. Berkeley, for example, in examining the stock (and\npossibly the only) use of \u2018infinitesimals\u2019, was examining\nthe way in which this word was employed by mathematicians.\nPhilosophers of law, biology, mathematics, formal logic, theology,\npsychological and grammar are all required to examine technical terms\nor concepts. So if \u2018ordinary\u2019 is contrasted with\n\u2018technical\u2019 or \u2018specialised\u2019 then some\nphilosophy is and some philosophy is not concerned with ordinary\nlanguage (1953, 304).\n\nBut one reason it may be true that philosophy should be couched in\nvernacular terms has to do with philosophy\u2019s special task. Just\nas the cartographer was required to use a different, more general\nvocabulary to plot the geography of the local village, so too should\nthe philosopher use a more general vocabulary than the\nspecialist\u2019s to plot the \u201ccross-bearings\u201d between\nthe concepts of different theories. The tangles and knots that a\nphilosopher has to unpick are set not by some branch of specialist\ntheory, but \u201cin the thought and the discourse of everyone,\nspecialists and non-specialists alike\u201d (1953, 304).\n\nTalk about the use of an expression, like the use of\nsafety-pins and table-knives, helps us to avoid thinking that we are\ntalking about any queer relations or queer entities; to suppose or\nhalf-suppose that \u201cstudying the meaning of the phrase \u2018the\nsolar system\u2019 [is] \u2026 the same thing as studying the solar\nsystem\u201d (1953, 306). It reminds us, for example, that when\nenquiring into the problems of perception or in discussing the\nconcepts of seeing, hearing, and smelling, we are not\ntackling the questions of opticians, neuro-physiologists or\npsychologists. We are rather after accounts of how certain words work,\n\u201cnamely words like \u2018see\u2019, \u2018look\u2019,\n\u2018overlook\u2019, \u2018blind\u2019, \u2018visualise\u2019,\nand lots of other affiliated expressions\u201d (1953, 317).\n\nA philosopher of Ryle\u2019s ilk is interested in the informal logic\nof the employment of expressions; the nature of the logical force that\nexpressions have as components of theories and as pivots of concrete\narguments. That is why, he says, in our discussions we argue\nwith expressions and about those expressions in one\nand the same breath. We are trying to register what we are exhibiting;\nto codify the very logical codes which we are then and there observing\n(1953, 318).\n\nOften the appeal to what we do and do not say, or can or cannot say is\nresisted, Ryle says, by those who hold that philosophical disputes can\nbe settled by formalising the warring theses, or translating them out\nof the natural language in which they were originally constructed into\nthe notation, perhaps, of a Principia Mathematica. As we\nshould expect from a philosopher who sees his job as the plotting of\nthe logical force of expressions as they appear in different contexts,\nRyle describes as a \u201cformaliser\u2019s dream\u201d the\nconviction that the investigation can be regularised in such a way as\nto replace what was philosophically puzzling by logical problems\namenable to known and teachable procedures of calculation. Indeed, he\ndenies not only that the logic of everyday statements but even the\nlogic of the statements of scientists, lawyers, historians and\nbridge-players can in principle be adequately represented by the\nformulae of formal logic.\n\nOf course, he concedes, the logical behaviour of the terms of\nnon-notational discourse may be assisted by studies in formal logic;\nso may chess-playing assist generals. But waging a campaign can no\nmore be replaced by playing games of chess than the study of the\nlogical behaviour of the terms of non-notational discourse can be\nreplaced by doing formal logic. Thus in the slogan \u2018Back to\nordinary language\u2019, \u2018ordinary\u2019 may be contrasted\nwith \u2018notional\u2019. The slogan can then be used by those who\nhave awoken from the formaliser\u2019s dream. So used, he says, it\nshould be repudiated only by those who hope to replace philosophising\nby reckoning (1953, 316\u20137).\n6. The Official Doctrine and its Contemporary Offshoots\n\nRyle\u2019s writings on the question of what constitutes a\nphilosophical problem, and of the way to solve it, occupied him in the\n1920s and 30s. The Concept of Mind was written after this\n\u201clong spell of methodological talk\u201d: what was needed was\n\u201can example of the method really working\u201d (1970, 12).\nAlthough entitled The Concept of Mind, the book, Ryle tells\nus, is\n\nan examination of multifarious specific mental concepts, such as those\nof knowing, learning, discovering, imagining, pretending, hoping,\nwanting, feeling depressed, feeling a pain, resolving, doing\nvoluntarily, doing deliberately, perceiving, remembering and so\non. (1962b, 188)\n\n\nAs the analogy of philosophy with cartography suggests, Ryle\ninvestigates the workings not just of one concept by itself, but\n\u201call of the threads of a spider\u2019s web of inter-working\nconcepts\u201d (1962b, 189).\n\nThe book focuses on the \u201ctype-errors\u201d or \u201ccategory\nmistakes\u201d which philosophers of mind are prone to make when they\nconsider the logical form of \u201cmental conduct verbs\u201d,\nespecially if they use as their starting-point the \u201cJanus-faced\naccount of human life\u201d suggested by a Cartesian conception of\nthe mind.\n\nRyle\u2019s explicit target in The Concept of Mind is what\nhe calls the \u201cOfficial Doctrine\u201d, which results, he tells\nus, at least in part from Descartes\u2019 appreciation that Galilean\nmethods of scientific discovery were fit to provide mechanical\nexplanations for every occupant of space, together with\nDescartes\u2019 conviction that the mental could not simply be a more\ncomplex variety of the mechanical. This \u201ctwo-world\u201d,\nCartesian view has distinctive ontological, epistemological, and\nsemantic commitments that each lead to particular philosophical\npuzzles.\n6.1 The ontological commitment\n\nThe ontological commitment of the view is that there are two different\nkinds of things, body and mind, that are somehow harnessed together.\nThe one exists in space and is subject to mechanical or physical laws;\nthe other is not in space and is not subject to these laws. And yet\nthe mind and body influence each other. The view that mind and body\nare somehow fundamentally different or distinct, but nonetheless\ninteract, leads to the philosophical conundrum known as the\nmind-body problem. For contemporary philosophers of mind, the\nmind-body problem no longer involves construing the mind as an\nindependent substance. But working out the relation between mental and\nphysical properties remains an urgent project (Kim, 2).\n [4]\n\nIn contemporary philosophy of mind, Ryle is credited with having\nestablished an important connection between mental predicates and\nbehaviour; but many of his successors (Place, Armstrong, Putnam, and\nFodor) thought he misconstrued the nature of that connection. When\nstrict physicalist positions were beset by objections from the\nmultiple realisability of mental predicates,\n\u201ctoken-physicalist\u201d versions of functionalism (or\n\u201contic-neutral\u201d versions of the causal theory of mind)\nstepped up to the plate, and advertised that, in acknowledging\nbehavioural outputs as well as stimulus conditions, they were\nretaining what was right about Ryle\u2019s emphasis on behaviour (in\nthe circumstances), but rejecting what they considered the\n\u201cexplanatory vacuity\u201d of conceptual or definitional links\nbetween mental predicates and behavioural ones. These were replaced\nwith causal links between the alleged referents of the mental terms\nand the action to be explained.\n\nBut to suppose the explanatory power of mental conduct terms depends\non their designating an event or state that is causally related to the\nperformance is to accept another version of the\n\u201cparamechanical\u201d hypothesis, even though it is now couched\nin ontic-neutral or physicalist\n terms.[5]\n\nAlthough Ryle\u2019s own target is the attempt to staple an elusive\nmental event construed as a conscious \u201cexperience\u201d onto a\nrespectable biological (muscular, neurophysiological) causal chain, it\nis nevertheless clear that the problems he sees will also apply to\nmodern-day variations on the dualist theme. That is, it will also\napply to weak, non-reductive identity theories that wish to preserve a\ncausal role for mental properties. For consider:\n\nThe episodes supposed to constitute the careers of mind have one sort\nof existence, while those constituting the careers of bodies have\nanother sort; and no bridge-status is allowed \u2026. Minds, as the\nwhole legend describes them, are what must exist if there is to be a\ncausal explanation of the intelligent behaviour of human bodies; and\nminds, as the theory describes them, live on a floor of existence\ndefined as being outside the causal system to which bodies belong.\n(1949a, 65)\n\n\nIt would be difficult to find a better anticipation of the mind-body\nproblem as we know it today. The problem of mental causation may not\nbe exactly the same as Descartes\u2019 problem, but it is nonetheless\ninherited by anyone who insists that mental properties must, on the\none hand, make a causal difference and by those who, on the other,\nthink that physics is a closed causal system. Just as mind-body\ninteraction was a problem for substance dualism, so is mental\ncausation still the problem facing the many varieties of\n(both reductive and non-reductive) physicalism (Kim, 29-30).\n\nIt seems then that the two ontological aspects of the Official\nDoctrine\u2014finding a place for the mental in the physical world\nand the problem of mental causation\u2014still survive today.\n6.2 The epistemological and semantic commitments\n\nThe ontological commitments of the Official Doctrine lead to the\nmind-body problem; the epistemological commitments of the Official\nDoctrine lead to the problem of other minds. According to the\ntraditional view, bodily processes are external and can be witnessed\nby observers, but mental processes are private, \u201cinternal\u201d\nas it is metaphorically described (since mental processes are not\nsupposed to be locatable anywhere). Mental processes or events are\nsupposed, on the official view, to be played out in a private theatre;\nsuch events are known directly by the person who has them either\nthrough the faculty of introspection or the\n\u201cphosphorescence\u201d of consciousness. The subject of the\nmental states is, on this view, incorrigible\u2014her avowals of her\nown mental states cannot be corrected by others\u2014and she is\ninfallible\u2014she cannot be wrong about which states she is\n in.[6]\n Others can know them only indirectly through \u201ccomplex and frail\ninferences\u201d from what the body does.\n\nBut if all that is mental is to be understood in this way, it is\nunclear how we are justified in believing that others have the\nrequisite episodes or mental accompaniments. It would be possible, on\nthis view, for others to act as if they are minded, but for them to\nhave none of the right \u201cconscious experiences\u201d\naccompanying their actions for them to qualify as such. Perhaps we are\nin much the same position as Descartes who thought it made sense to\nwonder whether such creatures are automata instead.\n\nThe problem of other minds is compounded by even more serious\ndifficulties given certain assumptions about the way language works.\nProponents of the Official Doctrine are committed to the view that\nmental discourse serves to designate items that carry the metaphysical\nand epistemological load of that doctrine.\n\nThe verbs, nouns and adjectives, with which in ordinary life we\ndescribe the wits, characters and higher-grade performances of the\npeople with whom we have do, are required to be construed as\nsignifying special episodes in their secret histories, or else as\nsignifying tendencies for such episodes to occur. (1949a, 16\u201317)\n\n\nRyle\u2019s criticism of the Official Doctrine begins by pointing out\nan absurdity in its semantic consequences. If mental conduct verbs\npick out \u201coccult\u201d causes then we would not be able to\napply those verbs as we do; so something must be wrong with a theory\nof mental phenomena that renders so inadequate our everyday use of\nthese verbs. For, according to the Official Doctrine\n\nwhen someone is described as knowing, believing or guessing something,\nas hoping, dreading, intending or shirking something, as designing\nthis or being amused at that, these verbs are supposed to denote the\noccurrence of specific modifications in his (to us) occult stream of\nconsciousness. (1945, 17)\n\n\nRyle\u2019s criticism of the view is that if it were correct, only\nprivileged access to this stream of consciousness could provide\nauthentic testimony that these mental-conduct verbs were correctly or\nincorrectly applied. \u201cThe onlooker, be he teacher, critic,\nbiographer or friend, can never assure himself that his comments have\nany vestige of truth.\u201d And yet,\n\nit was just because we do in fact all know how to make such comments,\nmake them with general correctness and correct them when they turn out\nto be confused or mistaken, that philosophers found it necessary to\nconstruct their theories of the nature and place of minds. Finding\nmental-conduct concepts being regularly and effectively used, they\nproperly sought to fix their logical geography. But the account\nofficially recommended would entail that there could be no regular or\neffective use of these mental-conduct concepts in our descriptions of,\nand prescriptions for, other people\u2019s minds. (1949a, 17)\n\n\nRyle is often given credit for having shown some of the many\ndifficulties in substance or Cartesian dualism. But the arguments in\nThe Concept of Mind warn of difficulties for any account that\ntakes mental conduct terms to discharge their explanatory role by\nsignifying inner processes: whether irreducibly mental or at bottom\nphysical. Ryle\u2019s target was not merely the ghostliness of the\nmental processes hypothesized by the Cartesian; it was their essential\nhidden-ness. The thrust of Ryle\u2019s polemic is that theories about\nthe nature of the alleged referents of the mental concepts we employ\nin our ordinary everyday commonsense practices cannot make a mystery\nof this employment without threatening to rob the theories of their\nsubject matter. Our practice of employing such mental concepts would\nbe a complete mystery on a view that takes the\n\u201ctruth-makers\u201d of our mental statements to be not only\nitems within an occult (to others) stream of consciousness, but also\non a view that takes them to be items within an occult (to most of us)\nseries of computations or neurological events. Both picture the\ntruth-makers of our claims about other minds or our ascriptions of\nmental predicates as hidden and thus in practice (if not in principle)\nas inaccessible.\n7. The Intellectualist Legend\n\nTo highlight the general difficulties with Cartesianism is only part\nof Ryle\u2019s destructive strategy. The other part is to show how\nlogical absurdities arise with one particular offshoot of the Official\nDoctrine: one he dubs \u201cthe intellectualist legend\u201d. This\ninvolves the type-error or category mistake of supposing that what\ndistinguishes certain performances from others that are perceptually\nsimilar (in one sense of \u2018perceptual\u2019) is the addition of\nsome non-perceptual feature. The Official Doctrine construes this\nfeature as a special mental\n accompaniment.[7]\n The intellectualist legend, accepting this construal of the Official\nDoctrine, says that intelligent or rational behaviour can be\naccommodated or explained by some sort of theoretical operations\ninvolving these hidden accompaniments. But if this is a mistake, it is\na big one; for it is made not only throughout various sub-branches of\nphilosophy but also in collaborating disciplines. (The idea, for\nexample, that intelligence involves physically realised,\n(non-introspectible) theoretical (computational) operations is one of\nthe founding blocks of the cognitive sciences.)\n\nThis picture of how rational abilities in general are to be explained,\nincluding the ability to speak a language, was called into question by\nRyle in a number of early papers (especially in 1946a, ostensibly\nreworked as the second chapter of 1949a, and in 1946b and 1950). It\nwas also called into question by Wittgenstein in his discussion of\nrules (Wittgenstein, \u00a7\u00a7143\u2013155 and 179\u2013202).\n\nIn broad brush-strokes, Ryle\u2019s argument-strategy against the\nsupposition that generally intelligent or rational abilities can be\nexplained in terms of prior theoretical operations (involving the\napprehension of the relevant truths) is to exhibit how the supposition\nleads to logically vicious regresses. Intelligent behaviours cannot be\nexplained, in general, by assuming that theoretical operations have\ngone on behind the scene, since those operations themselves can be\nintelligent or non-intelligent. The supposition that intelligent\nbehaviour always requires prior (or even contemporaneous) theoretical\noperations launches a vicious regress of theoretical operations. Thus,\nit must be allowed that some intelligent behaviour is not the outcome\nof prior theoretical operations.\n\nThe role of the rules, standards, or norms that govern our practices\nshould neither be exaggerated nor underestimated. For Ryle (as for\nWittgenstein), rules are codifications or distillations of normative\npractices that are already up and running. As Ryle aptly quips,\n\n[t]here were reasoners before Aristotle and strategists before\nClausewitz. The application of rules of reasoning and strategy did not\nhave to await the work of their codifiers. Aristotle and Clausewitz\nwere, in fact, only able to extract these rules, because they were\nalready being applied. (1946b, 233)\n\n\nThe crystallisation of performance-rules in rule-formulae is, in some\ncases, a product of studies in the methodology of the practices in\nwhich they have already been applied and not the condition of their\nbeing applied. In other words: there must be a way of applying a rule\nthat does not require the prior consultation of an expression of that\nrule.\n\nClose attention to the cases in which we credit someone for her\nperformance shows that it is often enough for her (merely) to have\nsatisfied certain criteria or for her performance to have lived up to\nthe relevant standard. Close attention to the cases in which we\nrequire not only that she satisfy certain criteria but also that she\napply the criteria by using an expression of a rule to guide her shows\nthat the latter is in fact a separate skill, which we only sometimes\n(but importantly not always) demand of the one we wish to credit for\nher\n performance.[8]\n\nThe ability to apply criteria in order to ensure that one\u2019s\nperformance is successful is like showing a ticket in order to ensure\none\u2019s right to travel by rail (1950, 239\u201340). It would be\na category mistake to imagine that the ticket itself plays a role in\nthe explanation of the train journey on the same level as the pistons,\nlevers, and tracks. So, too (we might add), would it be a category\nmistake to imagine that reasons, for example, play a role in the\nexplanation of action on (almost) the same level as the internal\nprocesses that explain (in a different sense) the body\u2019s\nmotions; or that meanings or understandings play a role in the\nexplanation of language use on (almost) the same level as the internal\nprocesses that explain (again, in a different sense) vocalisations.\nBut just this type of category error seems to be made by those who\nconstrue the relevant mental phenomena, including understanding, as\ninner causal\n events.[9]\n\nFor discussion of the importance of skill, drill, powers and\npropensities, see B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m and Gustafasson 2017. \n\nFor more discussion on some of the themes in this section, see the\nsupplement:\n\nSome Problems in Contemporary Work on Knowing-How and Knowing-That\n\n8. Behaviourism\n\nRyle\u2019s view is standardly characterised as a weaker or\n\u201csofter\u201d version of this doctrine (Smith and Jones, 144).\nAccording to this standard interpretation, Ryle\u2019s view is that\nstatements containing mental terms can be translated, without loss of\nmeaning, into subjunctive conditionals about what the individual will\ndo in various circumstances. So Ryle (on this account) is to be\nconstrued as offering a dispositional analysis of mental statements\ninto behavioural ones. It is conceded that Ryle does not confine his\ndescriptions of what the agent will do (under the circumstances) to\npurely physical behaviour\u2014in terms, say, of skeletal or muscular\ndescriptions\u2014but is happy to speak of full-bodied actions like\nscoring a goal or paying a\n debt.[10]\n But the \u201csoft\u201d behaviourism attributed to Ryle still\nattempts an analysis (or translation) of mental statements into a\nseries of dispositional statements which are themselves construed as\nsubjunctive conditionals describing what the agent will do (albeit\nunder the relevant action description) under various circumstances.\nEven this \u201csoft\u201d behaviourism is bound to fail, however,\nsince mentalistic vocabulary is not analysable or translatable into\nbehavioural statements even if these are allowed to include\ndescriptions of actions. For the list of conditions and possible\nbehaviour will be infinite since any one proffered translation can be\ndefeated by slight alteration of the circumstances; and the defeating\nconditions in any particular case may involve a reference to facts\nabout the agent\u2019s mind, thereby rendering the analysis circular.\nIn sum, the standard interpretation of Ryle construes him as offering\na somewhat weakened form of reductive behaviourism whose reductivist\nambitions, however weakened, are nonetheless futile.\n\nBut this characterisation of Ryle\u2019s programme is wrong. Although\nit is true that Ryle was keen to point out the dispositional nature of\nmany mental concepts, it would be wrong to construe him as offering a\nprogramme of analysis of mental predicates into a series of\nsubjunctive conditionals. The relationship between mental predicates\nand the \u201chypothetical\u201d and \u201csemi-hypothetical\u201d\nsentences with which we can \u201cunpack\u201d them is other than\nthat required by this kind of analysis.\n\nIt will be helpful to keep in mind that Ryle\u2019s target is the\nOfficial Doctrine with its attendant ontological, epistemological, and\nsemantic commitments. His arguments serve to remind us that we have in\na large number of cases ways of telling or settling disputes, for\nexample, about someone\u2019s character or intellect. If you dispute\nmy characterisation of someone as believing or wanting something, I\nwill point to what he says and does in defending my particular\nattribution (as well as to features of the circumstances). But our\npractice of giving reasons of this kind to defend or to challenge\nascriptions of mental predicates would be put under substantial\npressure if the Official Doctrine were correct.\n\nFor Ryle to remind us that we do, as a matter of fact, have a way of\nsettling disputes about whether someone is vain or whether she is in\npain is much weaker than saying that a concept is meaningless unless\nit is verifiable; or even that the successful application of mental\npredicates requires that we have a way of settling disputes in all\ncases. Showing that a concept is one for which, in a large number of\ncases, we have agreement-reaching procedures (even if these do not\nalways guarantee success) captures an important point, however: it\ncounts against any theory, say, of vanity or pain that would render it\nunknowable in principle or in practice whether or not the\nconcept is correctly applied in every case. And this was precisely the\nproblem with the Official Doctrine (and is still a problem, as I\nsuggested earlier, with some of its contemporary progeny).\n\nRyle points out in a later essay that there is a form of dilemma that\npits the reductionist against the\n duplicationist[11]:\n those whose battle cry is \u201cNothing but \u2026\u201d and those\nwho insist on \u201cSomething else as Well \u2026\u201d. Ryle\nattempts a dissolution of these types of dilemma by rejecting the two\nhorns; not by taking sides with either one, though part of what\ndissolution requires in this case, as in others, is a description of\nhow both sides are to be commended for seeing what the other side does\nnot, and criticised for failing to see what the other side does.\n\nThe attraction of behaviourism, he reminds us, is simply that it does\nnot insist on occult happenings as the basis upon which all mental\nterms are given meaning, and points to the perfectly observable\ncriteria that are by and large employed when we are called upon to\ndefend or correct our employment of these mental terms. The problem\nwith behaviourism is that it has a too-narrow view both of what counts\nas behaviour and of what counts as observable. The attraction of\nCartesianism is that it recognizes in a way the behaviourist does not\nthat there may be crucial differences between creatures who\u2014on a\ncertain restrictive notion of behaviour\u2014do indeed behave\nidentically. The problem with Cartesianism is that it attempts to\naccount for these differences by hypothesizing the existence of occult\nor hidden causes.\n\nIn an attempt to defeat the Cartesian or Platonist and remind us that\nmental predicates have perfectly ordinary standards of application,\nRyle focuses on what is observable. It is part of his war against what\nis not only occult (and observable only through introspection) but\nalso against what is hidden from the viewpoint of a third-party\nobserver. But, in focussing on what is observable, he does not commit\nhimself to reducing what is observable itself to sequences of\n\u201cmuscular behaviour\u201d. Those who attribute to Ryle a\n\u201csoft\u201d behaviourism are at least correct that the\nreminders he issues to ward off Cartesianism include frank appeal to\nwhat he later will describe as actions much higher up on the\n\u201csophistication ladder\u201d like paying a bill, or scoring a\ngoal, as well as to what he will later call \u201cconcrete\u201d,\n\u201cper se\u201d, or \u201cinfra\u201d doings like\nscribbling numbers on a cheque book or kicking a ball between two\nposts.\n\nSurely, as his earlier critics pointed out (and as those who see him\nas a behaviourist ignore) some of the phenomena he allows will\nreintroduce a realm of private occurrences (dreams and imaginings will\nbe the paradigm case). But as Ayer suspects, this sort of\n\u201cghost\u201d is an honest ghost. Not simply (as Ayer suggests)\nbecause the phenomena do not command the stage of a private theatre:\nin the sense that no one else can tell us about them they are in that\nrespect\n private.[12]\n As Ryle himself admits, \u201cthe technical trick of conducting our\nthinking in auditory word-images, instead of spoken words, does indeed\nsecure secrecy for our thinking \u2026\u201d (1949a, 35).\n\nIt is an \u201chonest ghost\u201d since privacy or secrecy of\ncertain episodes will not lead to privacy for them all; and thus the\nepistemological concomitant to the Official Doctrine that would lead\nto the problem of other minds is not a threat. Nor does this sort of\nprivacy usher in the semantic consequences of the Official Doctrine.\nThe privacy attending our dreams and imaginings does not impugn our\nright to draw on observable (in the robust sense of the term)\nphenomena to defend our right to employ mental predicates for a large\nnumber of cases, for \u201cthis secrecy is not the secrecy ascribed\nto the postulated episodes of the ghostly shadow-world\u201d (1949a,\n35).\n\nThere will indeed be cases in which only the agent can say whether she\nis pondering, imagining, dreaming, letting her mind wander,\ncalculating, solving, planning, or rehearsing. But the sort of privacy\nin which only she can say whether she was doing any of these or other\nparticular things is not the sort of privacy that gives rise to\nphilosophical conundrums like the problem of other minds and the\nproblem of necessarily private languages. On the contrary, the ability\nto describe one\u2019s dreams (as well as one\u2019s sensations)\npresupposes a language whose terms have established and\npublic criteria for their correct use.\n9. Dispositional Concepts\n\nA constant irritant for Ryle, throughout his writings, is \u201cthe\npreposterous assumption that every true or false statement either\nasserts or denies that a mentioned object or set of objects possesses\na specified attribute\u201d (1949a,\n 115).[13]\n As an example of a kind of sentence whose primary job is other than\nfact-stating, consider laws. Although we speak of law-sentences as\ntrue or false, \u201cthey do not state truths or falsehoods of the\nsame type as those asserted by the statements of fact to which they\napply or are supposed to apply\u201d (1949a, 116\u20137). The way to\nbring out the difference is to note that part of the point of trying\nto establish laws is to find out how to infer from particular matters\nof fact to other particular matters of fact, how to explain particular\nmatters of fact by reference to other matters of fact, and how to\nbring about or prevent particular states of affairs.\n\nA law, Ryle tells us, is \u201can inference ticket (a season ticket)\nwhich licenses its possessors \u2026 to move from one assertion to\nanother, to provide explanations of given facts, and to bring about\ndesired states of affairs by manipulating what is found existing or\nhappening\u201d (1949a, 117).\n\nA dispositional sentence such as \u2018Jones believes the earth is\nround\u2019 is unlike a law-sentence insofar as it mentions an\nindividual, Jones. But it is like a law-sentence insofar as its role\nis not (or not primarily) one of describing or reporting, or stating\nthat some object has such-and-such an attribute or stands in\nsuch-and-such a relation with another object. Its\n\u201ctruth-maker\u201d, to use a contemporary expression, has to be\nunderstood in terms of what would satisfy it as opposed to what it\npurportedly\n describes.[14]\n What would satisfy a law is not specified or mentioned in the\nlaw-sentence; similarly, what would satisfy a disposition is not\nspecified or mentioned in the disposition-sentence. Nor could it be.\nWhat would satisfy \u2018Jones believes the earth is round\u2019 is\nan open-ended (infinite) list of inferrings, imaginings, saying, and\ndoings (etc.) on the part of Jones (1949a, 44). (And note again, a\npropos of behaviourism, that if \u2018imagining\u2019 is construed\nin one of its ordinary senses, as something someone may be doing just\nby sitting, unmoving, with his hand on his chin, there is explicit\nreference to an irreducible-to-behaviour mental occurrence in this\nspecification of what would satisfy the sentence as well as the\nexplicit denial of the finiteness of the long list that would unpack\nthe sentence by alluding to its satisfaction conditions.)\n\nRyle suggests that \u2018John knows French\u2019 is a warrant which\ngives us the right to infer that John understands what he reads in\nLe Monde or that he is communicating successfully when\ntelephoning in French. Immediately on specifying what we are\nentitled to do with the inference ticket \u2018John knows\nFrench\u2019, Ryle admits that the examples of what would satisfy the\nsentence are too precise, for\n\n[w]e should not withdraw our statement that he knows French on finding\nthat he did not respond pertinently when asleep, absentminded, drunk,\nor in a panic; or on finding that he did not correctly translate\nhighly technical treatises. We expect no more than that he will\nordinarily cope pretty well with the majority of ordinary French-using\nand French-following tasks. \u2018Knows French\u2019 is a vague\nexpression and, for most purposes, none the less useful for being\nvague. (1949a, 119)\n\n\nTo adopt a couple contemporary turns of phrases, the warrants or\ninference tickets provided are therefore pro tanto and\noccasion-sensitive. The latter is yet another feature of\nRyle\u2019s view that puts him at a safe distance from the ideals of\nanalytical behaviourism. \n\nRyle concedes that what he says about dispositional sentences is\nlikely to be contested by the \u201caddicts of the superstition that\nall true indicative sentences either describe existents or report\noccurrences\u201d (1949a, 119). How could the statement \u2018This\nwire conducts electricity\u2019 or \u2018Jones believes the earth is\nround\u2019 be true unless there were something now going on, albeit\nunfortunately behind the scenes? (Note that this applies to those\ntoday who take it for granted that dispositional concepts report\nexistences (\u2019dispositions\u2019) which in turn, it is argued,\nrequire \u2019causal bases\u2019 to facilitate prediction,\nexplanation, and modification.) But consider Ryle\u2019s argument\nagainst this. Even those who are attracted by this picture will have\nto admit that we often do know that a wire conducts electricity, that\nan individual knows French, that a person is proud, that a sugar cube\nis soluble, without having discovered anything in the appropriate\nsense \u201chidden\u201d (read: accessible via introspection or\nlaboratory experiment). In any case what would be the point or the\ntheoretical utility of discovering what is hidden? Ryle suggests the\nutility would consist only in its entitling us to do just that\npredicting, explaining, and modifying which we already do and often\nknow that we are entitled to do. Even if these postulated processes\nwere conceded, they themselves are hypotheses or inferences to\n(\u201cthe best explanation\u201d): processes the existence of which\nare inferred from the fact that we can predict, explain, and modify\nthe observable actions and reactions of individuals. So if a theorist\ndemands actual \u201crails\u201d to ground ordinary inferences, this\ntheorist will have to provide some further \u201crails\u201d to\njustify his own peculiar inference from the legitimacy of ordinary\ninferences to the purported \u201crails\u201d that he supposes to\nground them. \u201cThe postulation of such an endless hierarchy of\n\u2018rails\u2019 could hardly be attractive even to those who are\nattracted by its first step\u201d (1949a, 120). \n10. Self-knowledge\n\nThe editors of a contemporary volume on self-knowledge write:\n\nEach of us effortlessly knows an enormous amount about those of our\nattributes which go with our rationality, sentience, and affective\nsusceptibilities: our beliefs, hopes, desires, and fears, whether we\nhave a headache or an itchy toe, whether we are elated or depressed,\nwhom we love and hate, what attracts or repels us. (Wright, et. al.,\n1)\n\n\nWhereas knowledge of others\u2019 sensations, emotions, and\nintentional states demands reliance on independently articulatable\ngrounds, self-knowledge is, by contrast, characteristically immediate.\nThis immediacy is already enough to be philosophically perplexing, but\nnot only do we know differently from others what we think,\nhope, and feel, we are also, in normal circumstances, regarded as\nknowing best. Furthermore, if we do enjoy certain mental\nattributes, we are expected to know that we do: our mental states are\nsalient to us. According to the editors, \u201c[t]hese three features\nof the epistemology of self-knowledge\u2014immediacy,\nauthority, and salience\u2014combine to set a\ncertain explanatory problem \u2026\u201d.\n\nTo what extent does this explanatory puzzle arise because of a tacit\nallegiance to Cartesianism? We have already seen how the\nepistemological consequences of the Official Doctrine lead to the\nproblem of other minds. The other side of the Cartesian coin seems to\nput us in an especially privileged position with respect to our own\nminds. For, if ascribing mental predicates to others is problematic,\naccording to the Official Doctrine, ascribing them to ourselves is\nproblem-free. Immediacy, authority, and salience are features of the\nepistemology of self-knowledge that the Cartesian view is best-placed\nto accommodate.\n\nRyle would see this contemporary expression of the problem of\nself-knowledge as a result of the conflation of various suspect\nphilosophical tendencies. One of these has its roots in the\nepistemological strand of the Official Doctrine; another is the\ntendency of philosophers to underestimate the many-layered complexity\nof mental discourse. This includes the refusal to acknowledge that the\nsame sentence may have different elasticities or kinds of jobs, as\nwell as the tendency to favour sentence-jobs of informing, describing\nor reporting over those, for example, of explaining, exhorting,\nencouraging, or admonishing.\n\nFor if self-knowledge is to be construed as a sort of perception of\ninner states or events that are (by the special faculty of\nintrospection or by the \u201crefulgence\u201d of consciousness)\n\u201cvisible\u201d to me but not to others, then Cartesianism,\nthough seeming to leave knowledge of our own minds intact, instead\npresents an untenable picture of what this \u201cknowledge\u201d can\nbe. Sorting out this confusion puts what can genuinely be called\nself-knowledge on relative parity with other-knowledge. It will also\nleave room for the importance of \u201cunstudied talk\u201d,\n\u201cego-pronouncements\u201d, or \u201cavowals\u201d, which do\nenjoy protection from epistemic criticism. But once the nature of this\nprotection is understood, philosophical perplexity should be\nextinguished, not kindled.\n\nRyle accepts the sort of privacy or secrecy that attends our dreams,\nimaginings and silent soliloquies and he concedes that besides the\ndispositional one there is another sense of \u2018know\u2019 which\nhas to do with what a person is presently thinking, feeling or doing.\nHe does not deny the existence of mental processes of this kind\n(again, a reason to resist calling him a \u2018behaviourist\u2019);\nnor does he deny that I am the only one in a position to say what, for\nexample, my musings, ponderings, or dreams are about. Nor does Ryle\ndeny that usually when we witness something, or feel something, or act\nin such-and-such a way we are able, when asked, to give a correct\naccount of it. He denies, rather, that either the\n\u201cluminous\u201d or \u201crefulgent\u201d view of\nconsciousness or one that buys into the intellectualist legend is\nrequired to accommodate this ability. He acknowledges that the concept\nof visualizing, imagining, or \u201cseeing\u201d in the mind\u2019s\neye, and \u201chearing\u201d in the mind\u2019s ear are useful\nconcepts. He denies that these uses commit us to the existence of\npictures or images that we contemplate or tunes that we hear: rather\nthan construe someone who pictures his nursery as the spectator of a\nresemblance of his nursery, he should be construed as resembling a\nspectator in his nursery (1949a, 234).\n\nRyle\u2019s discussion of avowals introduces, in effect, a different\nelasticity in our use of \u2018know\u2019, when we say, for example,\nthat usually a person knows what she is on about. This has to do with\nher propensity to avow moods, feelings, inclinations, intentions,\ndesires, and so forth. One striking feature of avowals is that they\nseem to enjoy a special kind of security from epistemic assessment or\ncriticism. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d or \u201cI think you must\nbe mistaken\u201d or \u201cYou have been careless in your\nobservations\u201d do not make sense as rejoinders to avowals. For\nRyle,\n\n[i]f the avowal [\u201cI feel depressed\u201d] is to do its job, it\nmust be said in a depressed tone of voice; it must be blurted out to a\nsympathizer, not reported to an investigator. Avowing \u201cI feel\ndepressed\u201d is doing one of the things, namely one of the\nconversational things, that depression is the mood to do. It is not a\npiece of scientific premises-finding, but a piece of conversational\nmoping. (1949a, 99)\n\n\nRyle warns against construing the fact that avowals are unassailable\nas indicating that there is special kind of knowledge in play. From\nthe fact that these utterances are protected from epistemic assessment\nor criticism it does not follow that we have a special kind of\nknowledge about them; any more, says Ryle, than it follows from the\nfact that someone is not a quack doctor that he is a good doctor: for\nhe may not be a doctor at all (1993b, 216). For with the idea of\nknowledge comes the idea of truth, of justification, of\nrepresentation, of description, of taking closer looks, etc.\n\nThe standards for assessing \u201cego-pronouncements\u201d run along\nlines of sincerity/insincerity where these in turn are cashed out in\nterms of lying, feigning (for fun), acting (in a play), putting on\n(for sympathy), etc. When lying, feigning, etc., are ruled out, then\nsomeone\u2019s saying so may be on some particular occasion what\njustifies us in accepting or what gives us a reason to accept what he\nsays. The question of his being wrong (as measured against some\nadditional standard) may not arise. If he is not wrong in saying that\nhe is in pain (because he can only be lying or insincere in the ways\nthat we are imagining have been ruled out) it does not follow that he\nhas a special kind of knowledge. Rather, it would be more appropriate\nto say that questions of knowledge are here out of place. The\ndiscussion of avowals, then, illustrates yet another elasticity or\nsentence-job for certain mental expressions. None of this is to deny\nthat \u201cI am in pain\u201d, for example, may have a use which, on\nsome occasion, counts as a description. Indeed, it may be both a\ndescription and a complaint (1993a, 214).\n\nMany contemporary discussions in philosophy of mind and\nself-knowledge, accepting a modern variant of the assumptions of\nCartesianism, are committed to the view that in using mental\npredicates, we (or the subject) attribute(s) to the subject a mental\nstate or condition of which her subsequent behaviour is a causal,\ncontingent manifestation. But once the assumption is made that mental\nverbs function to pick out such underlying states or events, then\nseemingly incompatible demands are placed upon these states and the\ntraditional philosophical problem of self-knowledge is revealed.\nConstrued as speaking from and expressing an occurrent state the\nspeaker is authoritative; construed as speaking from or referring to a\ndispositional state she is not.\n\nIn Ryle\u2019s (and in Wittgenstein\u2019s) hands, pointing to the\nnon-descriptive, expressive, use of an utterance such as \u201cI\nintend to go to the store\u201d or \u201cI am bored\u201d is\nsupposed to put to rest the mystery of the avower\u2019s presumptive\nauthority; it is not supposed to invite the development of a\nphilosophical account to explain it. It constitutes a step not only in\nrebutting the Cartesian\u2019s accommodation of this authority, but\nalso in denying that there is only one use of the relevant\nexpression\u2014namely, to describe or designate a state, occurrence,\nor property\u2014in the first place.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when we consider perplexities about the\nSelf, such as when children ask \u201cWhere was I before I was\nborn?\u201d or (we might add) when many of us wonder \u201cWhere\nwill I be after I die?\u201d What, precisely, is the mysterious\nreferent of \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d, and\n\u201cmyself\u201d? Since the way out of this puzzle is not merely a\nrejection of the para-mechanical hypothesis, Ryle suggests a different\ndiagnosis:\n\nGratuitous mystification begins from the moment that we start to peer\naround for the beings named by our pronouns. \u2026 [however] the way in\nwhich the people mentioned are identified by pronouns is quite\ndifferent from the way in which they are identified by proper names.\n(1949, 179)\n\n\nLike the index finger used to point to an object, pronouns function as\n\u201cindex words\u201d. Indexicals such as \u201chere\u201d,\n\u201cnow\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d ,\u201cshe\u201d,\n\u201cI\u201d and \u2019\u201cmyself\u201d indicate the place,\ntime, or person referred to. \u201cI\u201d is not an extra name for\nan extra being any more than \u201cnow\u201d is a name for a special\ntime: \n\n\n\u2026 it indicates, when I say or write it, the same individual who can\nalso be addressed by the proper name \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d.\n\u201cI\u201d is not an alias for \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d; it\nindicates the person whom \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d names, when\nGilbert Ryle uses \u201cI\u201d. (1949, 180)\n\n\nFurthermore, the first personal pronoun has different elasticities of\nuse. Sometimes \u201cmyself\u201d, for example, can be replaced by\n\u201cmy body\u201d (or parts of my body), as in \u201cI am warming\nmyself (my hands) by the fire\u201d. In other contexts such pronouns\ncannot be so replaced. \n\n\nIt makes perfect sense to say that I caught myself just beginning to\ndream, but not that I caught my body beginning to dream, or that my\nbody caught me doing so \u2026. [1949, 181].\n\n\nThe puzzles are multiplied rather than solved when we talk of the Self\nas akin to a business\u2014with, for example, an executive branch\nand subordinate departments\u2014or a University\u2014with\nwarring or collaborative Faculties representing mental capacities.\n\u201cMyself\u201d and \u201cI\u201d, in the example above, are\nindex words or indexicals used in different senses or with different\nlogical ties, in different sorts of contexts.  \n\nThe construal of \u201cI\u201d as a name renders its supposed\nnominatum, the Self, and one\u2019s awareness of oneself, or\nself-consciousness, particularly elusive. For though we can catch hold\nof our streams of thoughts, and we can comment on this awareness, and\nperhaps even reflect upon our self-comment, and then regret having\nspent so much time in self-reflection, \u2026\u2014we can never capture\nthe last episode of self-awareness, until another one comes along\nwhich will, though capturing the last, will itself be elusive. \n\n\n\u2026 the more [one] puts one\u2019s finger on what the \u201cI\u201d\nstands for, the less does [one] succeed in doing so \u2026 Like the\nshadows of one\u2019s own head, it will not wait to be jumped on. And\nyet it is never very far ahead; indeed, sometimes it seems not to be\nahead of the pursuer at all. (1949, 178]) \n\n\nThe way out of the mystery is, again, to recognise that\n\u201cI\u201d does not name an elusive Self any more than\n\u201cnow\u201d names an elusive Present. Neither functions as\nnames. They indicate the person who utters it or the time it is\nuttered. \n\n\n\u2026 there is nothing mysterious or occult about the range of\nhigher-order acts and attitudes, which are apt to be inadequately\ncovered by the umbrella-title \u201cself-consciousness\u201d. They\nare the same in kind as the higher-order acts and attitudes exhibited\nin the dealings of people with one another. Indeed the former are only\na special application of the latter and are learned first from them.\nIf I perform the third order operation of commenting on a second order\nact of laughing at myself for a piece of manual awkwardness, I shall\nindeed use the first personal pronoun in two different ways \u2026. But so\nfar from this showing that there are two \u201cMes\u201d in my skin,\nnot to speak, yet , of the third on which is still commenting on them,\nit shows only that I am applying the public two-pronoun idiom in which\nwe talk of her laughing at him; and I am applying the method of\ninter-personal transaction which the idiom is ordinarily employed to\ndescribe. (1949,189) \n\n11. Thinking\n\nRyle\u2019s express target in The Concept of Mind was the\nCartesianism of the Official Doctrine, and the ontological,\nepistemological and semantic predicament we would be confronted with\nif the view were correct. Because of this target, many of his\nreminders about how mental expressions are used point to the kinds of\ncircumstances and performances that would satisfy them: often these\ninclude what others suitably trained have no trouble seeing. But he\nwas dissatisfied that in this work he left out some of the cardinal\nuses of concepts of thinking, in which there may be no performances\nfor others to witness. Certainly, the concept of thinking applies to\nobservable performances. But it also applies to the many\nthinking-activities we may imagine of Rodin\u2019s Le\nPenseur who is merely sitting on a rock with his chin in his\nhand. Ryle\u2019s professed long-range objective in much of his later\nwork was to come to an understanding of the various sorts of thinking\nqua pensive without committing either the\n\u201cCategory-howler of Behaviourism or the Category-howler of\nCartesianism\u201d (1979a, 17). In these later articles, he suggests\nthat what is needed besides the choice between \u201cnot muscular,\ntherefore inner\u201d or \u201cnot inner, therefore muscular\u201d\nis a way of enlarging the domain of the mental so that it includes not\nonly actions or performances but also certain omissions or failures to\nact that are conceived on a relatively high step of the ladder of\nsophistication of mental discourse (1979c, 119).\n\nLike all or at least most philosophically interesting concepts, Ryle\nthought there was no general answer to the question \u2018What does\nthinking consist of?\u2019 (any more that there is a general answer\nto the question \u2018What does working consist of?\u2019).\n\nWhen we start to theorise about thinking, we naturally hanker to\nfollow the chemist\u2019s example, namely, to say what thinking\nconsists of and how the ingredients of which it consists are\ncombined \u2026. But modelling thinking on processes like perspiring,\ndigesting, counting, and apple-picking, which can be broken down into\ningredient processes which have been coordinated in a certain way is a\nmistake \u2026. (1951b, 260)\n\n\nThere is a host of widely different sorts of toiling and idlings,\nengaging in any one of which is thinking.\n\nRyle rejects the view that thinking is symbol manipulation: indeed, he\ndenies that words, phrases or sentences are symbols, if symbols are to\nbe understood as proxies or as representations for something else\n(perhaps that which the word is alleged to designate). Thinking, in\nthe sense of pondering, calculating, and musing, is not reserved for\nthe labour of trying to decide things. Nor do we reserve the title\n\u2018thinking\u2019 for inner processes. An architect can think out\nhis plan while manipulating toy bricks as can a sculptor plan a statue\nin marble by modelling a piece of plasticine. Additional labours might\nbe necessary to put these plans into words. In general, thinking\nshould not be equated with using language.\n\nOur ordinary ways of describing our ponderings and musings tend to be\ngraphic and not literal. They should be histories, not chronicles, and\nas such the plot should be told in abstraction from any particular\nstream-of-consciousness reports of detail we may recall. In only some\ncases of thinking the accomplishment of a task, if there is one,\ninvolves the thinker\u2019s being equipped to declare his policy,\nscheme or theory. But there can be thinking where there is no talking\nor even the attempt to talk. Mozart\u2019s thinking results in\nsomething playable, not statable; Cezanne may make mistakes but is not\nin error. A symphony is not composed in English or German, it has no\ntranslation, and there is no evidence for or against it. Thus,\nalthough it is an important truth that the products of thinking may be\npublishable truths or falsehoods (and not unshareable\nintrospectibles), this is true for only some types of thinking (1979b,\n85).\n\nWhen the thinking does result in propositions or sayings, however, the\ntemptation is on the one hand toward excessive inflation, and on the\nother toward excessive deflation. For the result is not merely a\nstring of words linked together in a grammatically well-formed\nsentence. In recognising this truth, however, we are tempted toward\nthe view that bits of language are only necessary as the interpersonal\nvehicles of objective Meanings that are thinkable, in principle, to\nany hearers or readers of any nationalities.\n\nThese Meanings are for the Duplicationist those significance-cargoes\nthat are carried indifferently by your French and my English internal\nlocutions\u2014though the challenge to exhibit to his Reductionist\ncritic even one such cargo, prised off its French or English vehicle,\nis as usual unwelcome to him. (1979b, 87)\n\n\nRyle\u2019s solution is to reject the vehicle-cargo model. In owning\na penny, the duplicationist is right in saying I own more than a mere\nmetallic disc; but the reductionist is also right in rejecting the\nidea that I own two things: a mere disc and a non-metallic,\nunpocketable yet marketable cargo. The word I employ is not a noise\nand something else as well; nor is just a noise. In learning a\nword\u2019s meaning, I become enabled to conduct with it a host of\ninter alia informative, calculative, recording,\nanagram-solving, and versifying transactions of quite specific kinds.\nJust as a penny is not just a disc and nor is it a disc and something\nelse as well, so a word is not just noise, but nor is it a noise and\nsomething else as well. The penny is an institutionally-qualified\nenabling instrument that I can use for specific sorts of transactions.\nThe word is a complexly qualified noise, endowed with a quite specific\nsaying-power, endowed by institutional regulations, accumulating\npublic custom, pedagogic disciplines, and so on. The formulation of\nthe qualifications of both penny and word would \u201crequire not\njust some simple auxiliary nouns, simple adjectives or simple verbs\nbut a whole batch of syntactically variegated subordinate\nclauses\u201d (1979b, 88).\n\nEven if it is true that Le Penseur is saying things to\nhimself, this description fails because it stops just where it ought\nto begin. \u2018Murmuring syllables\u2019 to himself is the thinnest\npossible description of what he is engaged in. A thick description may\nbe that he is trying to find out whether or not the things that he is\nsaying will lead him where he wants to go:\n\n\u2026 in his pondering, reflecting, deliberating, etc., the thinker\nis not guiding himself anywhere, but trying to find out whether this\nor that track of his own making would or would not qualify as a\nguiding, as opposed to a mis-guiding, or non-guiding, track. (1968,\n494)\n\n\nExploring is on a higher-sophistication level than piloting; and\npiloting is on a higher sophistication level than following a\npilot\u2019s lead. If Le Penseur is trying to find the proof\nof a new theorem then he is working on a higher accomplishment-level\nthan he is in trying to teach his student his proof when he has got\nit; just as trying to teach it is on a higher-sophistication level\nthan that on which his students are working in trying to master\nit.\n\nOn its thinnest description, Le Penseur may be muttering to\nhimself a few geometrical words or phrases, just as on its thinnest\ndescription a penny is a piece of metal. But to say that that is not\nall he is doing (or that that is not all the penny\nis) is consistent with saying it is the only thing he is doing or with\ndenying that the penny is a piece of metal and something else as\nwell.\n\nA statesman signing his surname to a peace-treaty is doing much more\nthan inscribe the seven letters of his surname, but he is not doing\nmany or any more things. He is bringing war to a close by inscribing\nthe seven letters of his surname. (1968, 496)\n\n\nThinking can be saying things to oneself under a thin description.\nUnder a thicker description it may be saying things to oneself with\nthe specific heuristic intention of trying to open one\u2019s eyes or\nconsolidate one\u2019s grasp. It is this specific, experimental\nintention that is obliterated, Ryle tells us, by sweeping generic\nslogans such as \u201cThought is Language\u201d or \u201cThinking\nis Saying Things to Oneself\u201d, whether or not this is\nsupplemented by \u201c\u2026 and Something Else as Well.\u201d The\nadverb \u2018experimentally\u2019 adds not an extra action but the\nintention-to-find-out-what-happens-when \u2026. Neither the\nReductionist nor the Duplicationist (the Behaviourist or the\nCartesian) can account for the adverb\n\u2018experimentally\u2019.\n\nThey had tried to tell us what pondering is, eluding that little knot\nof subordinate clauses, such as \u2018\u2026 in order\nto \u2026\u2019, \u2018what happens\u2026\u2019, and\n\u2018\u2026 when \u2026\u2019 without which the notion of\nexperimenting cannot be unpacked; no more than burglary,\ntreaty-signing, or goal-scoring can deliberately be described in\nsimple adjectives plus simple verbs, whether mundane or\ntranscendent. What qualifies an undertaking as one of pondering or,\nnot very differently, as one of discussing, is not any catalogue of\nsimple qualities and simple relations, whether rude or refined, but\nsome nexus of statable because statement-shaped conditions. (1979b,\n82)\n\n12. Sensation\n\nRyle was unhappy with the treatment he gave of the concepts of\nsensation and perception in The Concept of Mind. In both the\nForeword and the Afterword of the chapter entitled \u201cSensation\nand Observation\u201d, he expresses his dissatisfaction at having\ngiven too much to the opposition by having \u201cfallen in\u201d\nwith the Official story that perceiving involves having\nsensations.\n\nIn a later paper (1956) Ryle corrects this. The idea that perceiving\ninvolves \u201chaving sensations\u201d is called into question with\nan investigation of the ordinary concepts of sensation and feeling and\ntheir relation to the technical notions of sense-impression and\nsense-data. (Arguably, today\u2019s notion of \u201cperceptual\nexperiences\u201d \u2013 conceptual or non-conceptual\u2014also\nfigure as a target of Ryle\u2019s arguments.) In this section, I\nshall discuss the negative thesis that perception does not require the\npostulation of sensations construed in its ordinary sense and why one\nmotivation for postulating sense-data or sense-impressions should be\nresisted. In the next, I discuss a different motivation and show why\nthe thickness of perceptual concepts thwarts attempts to discover the\n\u201cnature\u201d of perception in physiological, optical,\nacoustic, etc. phenomena.\n\nBoth philosophers and physiologists \u201cpass without apology\u201d\nfrom saying that without optical or auditory sense-impressions there\nis no seeing or hearing to saying that seeing and hearing involve the\nhaving of sensations. But can the sense-impressions which are\nsupposedly required for perception be identified with sensations or\nfeelings in one of their non-technical senses?\n\nRyle suggests not. On one understanding of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d we include pains, nausea, tickles,\nsuffocation, and thirst, which are distressing in some way. (In the\nConcept of Mind he notes that not all\n\u201cagitations\u201d are disagreeable: \u201cPeople voluntarily\nsubject themselves to suspense, fatigue, perplexity, fear, and\nsurprise \u2026\u201d(95).)\n\nA different understanding of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d comes with tactual sensations of external\nobjects and kinaesthetic sensations (of anatomically internal things\nand events). Instances of the latter include the feeling of warmth,\nsay, as my hand approaches a fire or feeling how cold, rough, smooth,\nslippery, or sticky some things are or whether they are vibrating,\nstiff, resilient, or loose.\n\nPace Berkeley, the difference between these types of states\nis not merely a matter of degree: feeling the warmth of a fire is not\nlike a feeling of pain. Feeling the fire is hotter than it was before\nis a matter of perception, discrimination, or finding out a\ndifference. People can be better at it than others: doctors acquire\nthe skill of feeling pulses that an untrained person cannot and race\ndrivers feel a car going into a skid well before an ordinary motorist\ncan. Feeling pain, giddy, nauseous, or high, by contrast are not a\nmatter of perception, an acquired skill or that which training can\nfine-tune. Mistakes due to carelessness are ruled out when we talk of\nsensations qua pain or elation; they are not ruled out when\nit comes to perception as discrimination or detection.\n\nArmed with these two sets of implication threads (and in this sense,\ndifferent understandings of, or things we count\nas) sensation or feeling, it can be seen that perception\nrequires neither of these. Seeing a cat does not require that I feel\nanything in the sense of pain, discomfort, tickle, giddiness, or calm\n(nor, we can add, relief, amusement, surprise, or rapture). Nor,\nhowever, does seeing a cat or hearing a violin require that I\ntactually or kinaesthetically feel with my eye or with my ear that\nwhich I also perceive. Nor does smelling require that I feel, in this\nsense, with my nose. And though the tongue is a double-sense organ\ninsofar as I can tactually and kinaesthetically detect the texture and\nthe temperature of food in my mouth, as well as taste it, tasting food\ndoes not depend upon my being able to feel these other properties of\nthe food with my tongue.\n\nSo, Ryle says, when philosophers and psychologists assert that all\nperceiving involves the having of sensations or the feeling of\nsomething, either they are wrong or they are using a third, different\nunderstanding of \u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling\u201d.\n\nLet us examine this different sense of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d. It does not seem to derive from ordinary use,\nwhich, we might suggest, would not in itself be a problem, as long as\nthe implication threads of one understanding are not crossed with\nthose of another. Consider the epistemologist\u2019s notion of\nsense-data or sense-impressions which are posited as candidates for\ngrounding knowledge or certainty in what is supposedly given in\nperception. Suppose this third understanding of sensation or\nfeeling derives from sense-data or sense-impressions thus\nunderstood. Whatever the merits or demerits of this view, in order for\nsensations\u2014now understood as sense-impressions or\nsense-data\u2014to play this foundational role, we must be\nconscious of them. Curiously enough, however, we do not report them.\nInstead, we report what we see under different descriptions, which\ncarry different luggage-loads. (Or, as Austin said, we report what we\nsee under different descriptions which depend, in part, on how far we\nare willing to stick our neck out.) Someone who claimed to see\nsomething green might subsequently, when he learns of the presence of\na cat, claim that what he saw was the eyes of a cat. The\n\u201cluggage\u201d that Ryle speaks of here includes the logical\nthreads (including implication and evidence, etc.) that accompany\ncertain descriptions rather than others. (There are more ways to be\nwrong, as Austin says, the more we stick our necks out.) We shall come\nback to this in the next section. But now we are investigating a\nthird, new sense of \u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling\u201d\nwhich derives, not from ordinary use, but from the (alleged) needs of\nepistemology. But what supports the idea that we see have such\nexperiences?\n\nNot the fact that we report appearances, for, as Ryle reminds\nus, we use the locution \u201cit appears that \u2026\u201d all the\ntime without committing ourselves to having any particular\nexperiences. \u201c15 x 16 appears to make 220\u201d or \u201cIt\nlooks as if the river is twice the size of the road\u201d commit me\nto no special sense-experiences. So, argues Ryle, we cannot adduce\nidioms of the patterns \u201cIt looks as if \u2026\u201d or\n\u201cIt appears \u2026\u201d as evidence of the untutored,\nuninferential manner in which the postulated sense-impressions are\ndelivered to consciousness. But this leaves us with a problem.\n\nWe have, in fact, no special way of reporting the occurrence of these\npostulated impressions; we are, therefore, without the needed marks of\nour being conscious of such things at all. For there is surely\nsomething absurd in maintaining that we are constantly conscious of\nsome things in the way in which we are conscious of pains, and yet\nhave no way of telling ourselves or other people anything whatsoever\nabout them. (1956, 343)\n\nThis particular theoretical allegiance that drives some\nepistemologists to posit sensations understood in the technical sense\nof sense-data has as its source the idea that there are two kinds of\nspace, which we know today, thanks to Sellars, as the space of reason\nand the space of natural law. In the first, the notion of inference,\nevidence, premises, evidence, and conclusions have their home; in the\nother is the raw \u201cdata\u201d understood in the sense of that\nwhich is given or accepted without argument.\n\nThe allegiance to this picture has its source in the view that all\nthinking intended to result in the discovery or establishment of\ntruths is inferring. A child sees a word on a page, an adult sees a\nmisprint, and an illiterate sees a black mark. Each has eyes in\nperfect working order. According to this view, the difference between\nseeing black marks, a word, or a misprint has to do with the reasoning\nwe bring to what is perceptually given. And sense-data (or, we may\nadd, perceptual experience) play the role of what is given prior to\nany thinking, and prior therefore to any exploitation of knowledge or\nbeliefs previously acquired. A datum, as it is used here, is something\nthat we reason from and does not have to be reasoned\nto.\n\nRyle dismisses this motivation for introducing sensation thus\nunderstood on the grounds that not all thinking is inferring.\nMultiplying, for example, is thinking but our calculations are not\nconclusions and our mistakes are not fallacies. If it is not true that\nthe thinking that enters into perceptual recognition, identification,\ncomparison, etc. is inferring then the search for its fund of premises\nis the search for nothing.\n\nBut worse, why suppose that seeing the misprint or seeing a crop of\nwheat (as opposed to a word, or a planted field) is thinking at all?\nIt may be discerned in a flash; there may be no moment, however short,\nin which one might be described as pondering, reflecting, or putting\ntwo and two together. All the argument has shown so far is that\nwithout a particular training, recognising a misprint or a crop of\nwheat would be impossible. Why suppose the exploitation of the\nknowledge resulting from this training involves thinking qua\nreflecting, pondering, or inferring?\n\nHere the fact that the misprint is immediately obvious to him is\nsupposed to need to be explained not just by reference to his prior\neducation, but also by the postulation of the performance by him of a\npiece of thinking, with the queer property of not requiring any time\nfor its performance. (1956, 345)\n\nAccording to Ryle, seeing a misprint involves the possession of the\nexploitation of knowledge already acquired. But this exploitation of\nknowledge required for perceptual recognition, identification, etc.\nneed not embody any thinking; a fortiori, it need not embody\ninferential thinking. \u201cSo the argument for the occurrence of\nsense-impressions to be the data or premises for the inferential\nthinking embodied is doubly broken-backed\u201d (1956, 345).\n\nReaders interested in Ryle\u2019s thoughts about perception and\nimagination are referred to the following supplementary documents:\n\nRyle on Perception\nRyle on Imagination\n\n13. Afterword\n\nThis has been a short tour\u2014concentrating on the philosophy of\nlanguage and mind\u2014through but a patch of the rich philosophical\nlandscape that Ryle has charted. Left out are a number of themes and\ninterests of Ryle, for example, his discussion of traditions in\nphilosophy from Plato, through the Phenomenological tradition and the\nwork of Brentano, Husserl, and then Heidegger, through the trenchant\nexposition of Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus, to his\ncriticism of Carnap, to Collingwood, and Anderson. I have not\ncommented on the dissolution of philosophical problems\nhe presented in his Tarner Lectures; nor have I been able to include\ndiscussions on morality, feelings, pleasure, and much more. Nor is\nthis reading of Ryle a standard one: even many of his students\ninterpreted him as a behaviourist and irrealist. I hope it is enough,\nhowever, to raise the possibility that his work has been widely\nmisunderstood, is presently underestimated, and that he has a lot to\ncontribute to today\u2019s debates.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PrimLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PrimLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<p>\nHere is a list of Ryle\u2019s works cited in this entry.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1929, \u201cNegation\u201d, <em>Proceedings of the Aristotelian\nSociety</em>, <em>suppl. vol. to</em> IX, and reprinted in\n<em>Collected Papers</em>, vol. 2, pp. 1\u201311.", "1930a, \u201cAre There Propositions\u201d, <em>Proceedings of\nthe Aristotelian Society</em>, XXX; reprinted in <em>Collected\nPapers</em> (Volume 2), pp. 12\u201338.", "1930b, \u201cAre there Propositions?\u201d, <em>Philosophical\nPapers</em> (Volume 2: Collected Essays), London and New York,\nRoutledge, 2009, pp. 13\u201340.", "1932, \u201cSystematically Misleading Expressions\u201d,\n<em>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</em>, 32: 139\u2013170;\npage references are to the reprint in <em>Collected Papers</em>\n(Volume 2), pp. 39\u201362.", "1933a, \u201cImaginary Objects\u201d, <em>Proceedings of the\nAristotelian Society</em>, <em>suppl. vol.</em> XII and reprinted in\n<em>Collected Papers</em> (Volume 2), pp. 63\u201381.", "1933b, \u201cAbout\u201d, <em>Analysis</em>, I, and reprinted in\n<em>Collected Papers</em> (Volume 2), pp. 82\u201384.", "1936, \u201cUnverifiability-By-Me\u201d, <em>Analysis</em>, IV,\nand reprinted in <em>Collected Papers</em> (Volume 2), pp.\n121\u2013130.", "1945, \u201cPhilosophical Arguments\u201d, originally delivered\nas the Inaugural Lecture as Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical\nPhilosophy, and reprinted in <em>Collected Papers</em> (Volume 2), pp.\n194\u2013211.", "1946a, \u201cKnowing How and Knowing That\u201d, <em>Proceedings\nof the Aristotelian Society,</em> XLVI.
