    "main_text": "Authorship of Sin\n7. Authorship of Sin\n\nThe traditional view is enigmatic, and a lot more would need to be\nsaid to make it convincing. But if an account along these lines can be\nmade to work, creaturely freedom is indeed reconcilable with divine\nsovereignty and omniscience. Our destinies are entirely subordinate to\nGod\u2019s creative will; he exercises full control in all that we\ndo, notwithstanding the fact that our deeds are fully voluntary, and\nwe have every reason to expect that all that takes place in the world\nwill reflect the providence of a perfectly loving father. As for\nomniscience, here too there is no difficulty. God knows about our\ndecisions and actions simply by knowing his own intentions, for he\nwills that they occur. Nor is his will exercised from the fastidious\ndistance preferred by Molinists, in which God creates us knowing what\nwe will do, but has no hand in our actually doing it. Rather, God is\nas much the cause of our sinful actions as of our virtuous ones, or of\nany other event.\n\nYet, Augustine and Aquinas would both insist, he remains perfectly\ngood and absolutely holy, a being deserving of our complete reverence\nand absolute devotion. How might such a thing be possible? Does not\nthe traditional view entail that God is the author of sin in some\nobjectionable way? This objection must be carefully distinguished from\nthe ordinary axiological problem of evil: the question of whether God\nhas sufficiently good reason to allow the evil and suffering which\nexist. The author of sin objection says that the traditional view\ninvolves God too intimately in evil even if he has sufficiently good\nreason for allowing it.\n\nPart of the answer lies in the fact that even if my act of deciding to\ngo to the concert tonight has its existence grounded in God\u2019s\ncreatively willing that I so decide, it is still I who act,\nstill I who decide. God\u2019s willing that I decide as I do does not\nmake my decision God\u2019s. Indeed, if it did, if my decision were\npredicated of God rather than me, his will would fail to achieve its\nobject. But it is not possible for God\u2019s will to be frustrated,\nas long as what he wills is consistent. So regardless of what we may\nthink of the traditional view\u2019s contention that divine\nsovereignty and creaturely freedom are fully compatible, that view\ndoes not take the operations of our will, or the actions founded upon\nthem, away from us. They remain our own. Consequently, any sin they\ninvolve remains ours also. Thus, if I decide sinfully to go to the\nconcert tonight \u2014 if, say, I am neglecting duties I know should\ntake priority \u2014 the sin is mine, not God\u2019s. If he is to be\nfaulted, it must be for some other reason. It should be noted,\nmoreover, that God\u2019s position in this respect is not much\ndifferent from what it is on the Molinist account. True, that view\ntakes certain things out of God\u2019s hands. Whether I would decide\nto go to the concert in the circumstances in which I will find myself\ntonight is not, according to Molinism, up to God. But it is up to him\nwhether I shall be created in those circumstances, and indeed whether\nI shall exist at all. On both views, God knowingly and willingly\ncreates a world in which rational creatures sin. The difference is\nthat on the traditional view God does have complete control: he can\ncreate any possible world, and he is as much involved as creator in\nthose acts in which we sin as he is in any others.\n\nThis is not a complete answer to the author of sin charge, simply\nbecause the author of sin objection is not one objection at all but a\nfamily of objections. It has as many different versions as there are\nobjectionable relations to sin that the traditional view might be\nthought to entail God bears. It might be argued that the traditional\nview entails that God is the cause of sin, or that God intends sin, or\nthat God desires that sin occur, or that God loses his moral standing to blame sinners for their sins, or that God fails to love the damned.\nEach of these charges must be treated individually (for a variety of\nresponses, see the collected essays in Alexander and Johnson 2016; see also Todd 2018 for a discussion of God\u2019s moral standing to blame sinners).\nHere it may suffice to point out that with respect to each individual\ncharge it is not obvious both that theological determinism entails\nthat God bears the property and that God\u2019s bearing the property\nwould be incompatible with divine perfection. For instance, as the\nabove author-storyteller model makes clear, theological determinism\ndoes not entail that God causes evil in the same way that created\nagents cause evil, and if the traditional privation theory of evil is\ntrue, then theological determinism does not entail that God causes\nevil at all (for more discussion of this appeal to the privation theory of evil, see White 2016, Furlong 2019, chapter 4, and Grant 2019, chapter 6). Nor it is clear that, on the correct view of creation,\ntheological determinism entails that God intends any evil at all;\nperhaps God selects the possible world he wishes to create all at\nonce, so to speak, intending only the good aspects of creation and\nmerely foreseeing (as an unintended side effect) all the evil that is\ncaught up with it (White 2016). God may even love the damned and\ndecide to decree their damnation, if there is a sufficiently great\ngood that cannot be brought about without it; a general may,\nconsistent with perfect love, order his son (a captain in his army,\nwhom he loves) to a certain death in defense of a city in order to\nprevent the greater tragedy of the city\u2019s sacking (Johnson\n2016). The question is whether there is such a great good; and this is\nthe ordinary, axiological problem of evil.\n",
