    "main_text": "Imitation || Sophist and other passages\n2.4 Sophist and other passages\n\nPlato\u2019s interpreters sometimes play up the passages in which he seems\nto counter the Republic\u2019s anti-poetic comments with hopeful\nassessments of imitation. According to the standard chronology of the\ndialogues, the relevant passages occur in dialogues written after the\nRepublic. If Plato changed his views over time, these\nconciliatory remarks could indicate that he ultimately disavowed the\ncensorship of Republic 10.\n\nThe Statesman for instance calls existing constitutions\nmim\u00eamata of moral truths as the philosophical\nlegislators know those truths (297c). Such likeness-making is not\nfraud, for its outcome remains something worthy of respect. One can\nsay the same for scientific theories in Plato\u2019s Timaeus,\nwhose main speaker Timaeus argues that discourse about the natural\nworld mimics the intelligible world (47c). The Laws sees\nimitation in music as a potentially accurate process (668b); the\nhard-to-date Menexenus urges the young to imitate their\nelders\u2019 virtues (236e, 248e). All these passages suggest, from\ndifferent angles, a rehabilitation for the process that Plato\nelsewhere demeans as counterfeiting (Robinson 2016).\n\nNevertheless these passages do scarcely more than touch on\nmim\u00easis. What Plato says about imitation when he has\nset out to define and evaluate it ought to weigh more heavily than a\nuse of the word he makes briefly. Anyway the later dialogues do not\nspeak as one. Plato\u2019s Sophist, a companion to the\nStatesman, devotes much of its length to understanding\nmim\u00easis, and the context is derogatory.\n\nThe Sophist looks into imitation in order to define what a\nsophist is. But the sophist\u2014whom the main speaker calls an\nimitator (mim\u00eat\u00eas) and sorcerer\n(go\u00eat\u00eas) (235a)\u2014is not far removed from the\ndeceiving poet (Notomi 2011). And although the Sophist\u2019s\ntheory of imitation diverges somewhat from the one in\nRepublic 10, similarities between them preponderate. Like the\nRepublic the Sophist characterizes imitation\nmockingly as the creation of a whole world, and accuses imitation of\nmisleading the unwary (234b\u2013c), even if it also predicts more\noptimistically that people grow up to see through false likenesses\n(234d). Again as in Republic 10 imitation is contrasted with\na god\u2019s work\u2014except that in the Sophist gods make all\nliving things (265c\u2013d) and also images, eid\u00f4la\n(266a): dreams, shadows, reflections.\n\nMost importantly, the representation that Plato charges the sophist\nwith is fraudulent. It is the kind that makes not an honest likeness\n(eikasia) but an illusory image, a phantasma\n(235d\u2013236b). Makers of realistic statues are attending not to\nwhat a human figure really looks like but to what looking at it is\nlike. In drawing the distinction between these kinds of\nrepresentations the Sophist does strike a conciliatory tone\nnot found in Republic 10, for it seems that a branch of the\nmimetic profession retains the power to produce a reliable likeness of\nan object. But the consolation proves fleeting. Reliable imitation\nplays no role in a definition of sophists, would presumably play no\nrole in talk of poets either, and seems to make an appearance here\nonly for the purpose of being shuffled offstage as the excluded\nmim\u00easis, that which the imitation being talked about\nis not.\n\nThe Sophist decisively marginalizes positive imitation when\nit takes up mim\u00easis a second time, subdividing the\nproduction of illusions to identify a species in which imitators use\ntheir own voice and bodies: \u201cThis part is called imitation\n[mim\u00easis]\u201d (267a). The Eleatic Stranger who is\nspeaking recognizes that he has appropriated the general word for the\nspecific act of enacting false images. \u201cLet\u2019s designate this to\nbe what we call the imitative profession\n[mim\u00eatikon]\u201d; everything else in the large genus\ncan go by some other name (267a).\n\nNarrowing the process down to impersonation should make clear that\nPlato finds a sophist\u2019s imitativeness to be much like a poet\u2019s.\nMoreover this development neutralizes the suggestions that\nmim\u00easis has its good side. The imitative\ntechn\u00ea will have many manifestations, including those\nlegitimate practices that the Statesman and other dialogues\nrefer to; but the real work of mim\u00easis, the one that is\nworth defining and applies to dominant art forms, is mendacious\nimpersonation. Where Republic 3\u2019s taxonomy made imitation\nlook like a freakish variety of narration, this use of a word both\ngenerically and specially excludes good imitation as the exception and\nthe problem case. Essentially speaking the art of\nmim\u00easis is a bad and lying art.\n\nAfter all, as the Stranger says, there is a shortage of names for\ntypes of mim\u00easis. The ancients did not work hard enough\nmaking all relevant philosophical distinctions (267d). It is as if\nPlato were saying: \u201cColloquial language being loose, I will\nsometimes use mim\u00easis in the broader sense that\ncontains epistemically sound practices, even though the core sense of\nthe word is pejorative.\u201d\n\nWhether Plato should be permitted to juggle words\u2019 meanings\nis another question. His quest to condemn imitation leaves him open to\ncriticism. But he does not consciously change his theory in the\ndirection of imitation understood positively.\n",
