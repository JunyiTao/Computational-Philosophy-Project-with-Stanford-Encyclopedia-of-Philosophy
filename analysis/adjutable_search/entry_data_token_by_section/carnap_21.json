    "main_text": "Semantics and Modality || Intensional Semantics\n6.3 Intensional Semantics\n\nThe languages to which Tarski\u2019s semantics applied were\nextensional; Carnap\u2019s semantics extends Tarski\u2019s by\nassigning compositionally to each singular term, each predicate, and\neach sentence both an intension and an extension.\nThe intension of an expression explicates what we understand when we\nunderstand it, and Carnap\u2019s treatment of this is again\n\u201cminimalist\u201d in the sense that nothing subjective or\npsychological is involved; \u201cunderstanding\u201d is entirely\nschematic, i.e., determined solely by semantic rules. The extension of\nan expression at a state-description is determined by applying the\nsemantic rules (or the expression\u2019s intension) to the\nstate-description. In the words of David Lewis (1970: 23):\n\n\nThe plan to construe intensions as extension-determining functions\noriginated with Carnap\u2026 Accordingly, let us call such functions\nCarnapian intensions.\n\n\nA state-description (an idea that derives from the\n\u201cSpielr\u00e4ume\u201d in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus, and more distantly from Leibniz\u2019s idea of\npossible worlds) is simply a set X of sentences for which the\nfollowing is the case: for each atomic sentence in the object\nlanguage, either the sentence or its negation is a member of\nX, but not both; and X only includes atomic\nsentences or negations of atomic sentences. One state-description\ndescribes the \u201cactual state of the universe\u201d (Carnap 1947:\n\u00a72), and how a linguistic expression is evaluated at that\nstate-description recovers the Tarskian extension of the expression.\nIntensions are assigned to linguistic expressions by evaluating them\nat arbitrary state-descriptions.\n\nAccording to Carnap\u2019s setup, two sentences A and\nB have the same intension if and only if the equivalence \\(A\n\\leftrightarrow B\\) is L-true. A sentence is L-true\n(logically true) just in case it holds in in every state-description.\nFor Carnap this definition of L-truth explicates the informal\nidea that a sentence is logically true if it is true in virtue of\nsemantic rules alone without reference to empirical facts. Later,\nCarnap introduced the idea of \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d that\ncould restrict the range of state-descriptions (Carnap 1952) and\nadopted Quine\u2019s terminology by which only those sentences are\n\u201clogically true\u201d whose truth is evident from the logical\nparticles alone, while the larger class of sentences true in all\nstate-descriptions are called \u201canalytic\u201d.\n\nCarnap (1946, 1947) worked out an intensional semantics for necessity\nand possibility operators for different example languages, and for the\nmodal logic S5 that C.I. Lewis (1944) had previously discussed (see\nthe supplement\n Semantics (Section 1)\n for the details). He also started exploring areas that are presently\nof special interest, such as \u201chyperintensional\u201d semantics\n(see, e.g., Yablo 2014): In the context of addressing the paradox of\nanalysis, he found that a stronger or finer-grained notion of synonymy\nwas needed than identity of intension, i.e., L-equivalence,\nand he defined a relation called \u201cintensionally isomorphic\nto\u201d for that purpose. In response to critiques by Benson Mates\nand Leonard Linsky (1949), who pointed out instances of apparent\nsynonymity that were not intensionally isomorphic by Carnap\u2019s\ndefinition, Carnap replied that this just showed that the\nordinary-language conception of \u201csynonymity\u201d is vague, and\nthat actually it conceals a number, perhaps a range, of explicanda;\nfor certain purposes, he agreed, a still stronger (or finer-grained)\nconception of intensionality (and thus synonymity) might be required\n(Carnap 1949).\n\nAlonzo Church used Carnap\u2019s concept of intensional isomorphism\nin his reconstruction of Frege\u2019s notions of sense and reference,\n\u201cA formulation of the logic of sense and denotation\u201d\n(Church 1951), and later also addressed a critique to Carnap directly\n(Church 1954), to which Carnap (1954b) replied. John Myhill (1958) in\na critique of Church\u2019s reconstruction, re-discovered a paradox\nfirst spelled out by Russell in Appendix B of Principles that\nraises precisely the same issue about individuating intensions, and\nsince then the study of Russellian intensional logic, and\nfiner-grained versions of intensional identity, has continued (Church\n1976, 1985; Linsky 1988; Anderson 1989; Cantini 2004; Deutsch\n2014).\n\nCarnap argues in Meaning and Necessity (especially \u00a730)\nthat his method of extension and intension is an improvement over\nFrege\u2019s method of reference and sense, because it preserves the\nextension and intension of a linguistic expression across contexts\n(i.e., regardless of whether they are extensional or intensional\ncontexts), while Frege\u2019s method does not. Before Michael\nDummett\u2019s work on Frege, Carnap\u2019s detailed critical\nengagement with Frege\u2019s theory of sense and reference in this\nbook probably did more to establish Frege as a classic of analytic\nphilosophy than any other single impulse. Not only Church, but many\nothers were inspired not only to reconstruct Frege\u2019s original\nview in a more rigorous way, but to do so in the light of\nCarnap\u2019s challenge and his critique of those views from a modern\npoint of view. Carnap\u2019s intensional semantics is discussed in\nmore detail in the supplement\n Semantics (Section 1).\n",
