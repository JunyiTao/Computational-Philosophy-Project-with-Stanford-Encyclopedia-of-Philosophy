    "main_text": "Life and Works || Archytas and Tarentum\n1.3 Archytas and Tarentum\n\nArchytas is unique among Greek philosophers for the prominent role he\nplayed in the politics of his native city. He was elected general\n(strat\u00eagos) seven years in succession at one point in\nhis career (A1), a record that reminds us of Pericles at Athens. His\nelection was an exception to a law, which forbade election in\nsuccessive years, and thus attests to his reputation in Tarentum.\nAristoxenus reports that Archytas was never defeated in battle and\nthat, when at one point he was forced to withdraw from his post by the\nenvy of his enemies, the Tarentines immediately suffered defeat (A1).\nHe probably served as part of a board of generals (there was a board\nof ten at Athens). The analogy with Athens suggests that as a general\nhe may also have had special privileges in addressing the assembly at\nTarentum on issues of importance to the city, so that his position as\ngeneral gave him considerable political as well as military power. At\nsome point in his career, he may have been designated as a general\nautokrat\u00f4r (\u201cplenipotentiary\u201d) (A2), which\ngave him special latitude in dealing with diplomatic and military\nmatters without consulting the assembly, although this was not\ndictatorial power and all arrangements probably required the eventual\napproval of the assembly. We do not know when Archytas served his\nseven successive years as general. Some have supposed that they must\ncoincide with the seven year period which includes Plato\u2019s\nsecond and third visits to Italy and Sicily, 367\u2013361 (e.g.,\nWuilleumier 1939, 68\u20139), but Archytas need not have been\nstrat\u00eagos to play the role assigned to him during these\nyears in the Seventh Letter. The evidence suggests that most\nof Archytas\u2019 military campaigns were directed not at other\nGreeks but at native Italic peoples such as the Messapians and\nLucanians, with whom Tarentum had been in constant conflict since its\nfounding.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the Tarentum in which Archytas\nexercised such influence was not some insignificant backwater. Spartan\ncolonists founded it in 706. It was initially overshadowed by other\nGreek colonies in southern Italy such as Croton, although it had the\nbest harbor on the south coast of Italy and was the natural stopping\npoint for any ships sailing west from mainland Greece. Archytas will\nhave grown up in a Tarentum that, in accord with its foundation by\nSparta, took the Peloponnesian and Syracusan side against Athens in\nthe Peloponnesian War (Thuc. VI 44; VI 104; VII 91). Athens allied\nwith the Messapians (Thuc. VII 33), the long-standing enemy of the\nTarentines, against whom Archytas would later lead expeditions (A7).\nAfter the Peloponnesian War, Tarentum appears to have avoided direct\ninvolvement in the conflict between the tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius\nI, and a league of Greek cities in southern Italy headed by Croton.\nAfter Dionysius crushed the league, Tarentum emerged as the most\npowerful Greek state in southern Italy and probably became the new\nhead of the league of Italiot Greek cities (A2). In the period from\n380\u2013350, when Archytas was in his prime and old age, Tarentum\nwas one of the most powerful cities in the Greek world (Purcell 1994,\n388). Strabo\u2019s description of its military might (VI 3.4)\ncompares favorably with Thucydides\u2019 account of Athens at the\nbeginning of the Peloponnesian war (II. 13).\n\nDespite its ancestral connections to Sparta, which was an oligarchy,\nTarentum appears to have been a democracy during Archytas\u2019\nlifetime. According to Aristotle (Pol. 1303a), the democracy\nwas founded after a large part of the Tarentine aristocracy was killed\nin a battle with a native people, the Iapygians, in 473. Herodotus\nconfirms that this was the greatest slaughter of Greeks of which he\nwas aware (VII 170). There is no evidence that Tarentum was anything\nbut a democracy between the founding of the democracy in 473 and\nArchytas\u2019 death ca. 350. Some scholars have argued that\nTarentum\u2019s ties to Sparta and the supposed predilection of the\nPythagoreans for aristocracy will have insured that Tarentum did not\nremain a democracy long and that it was not a democracy under Archytas\n(Minar 1942, 88\u201390; Ciaceri 1927\u201332, II 446\u20137).\nStrabo, however, explicitly describes Tarentum as a democracy at the\ntime of its flourishing under Archytas (A4), and the descriptions of\nArchytas\u2019 power in Tarentum stress his popularity with the\nmasses and his election as general by the citizens (A1 and A2).\nFinally, Aristotle\u2019s account of the structure of the Tarentine\ngovernment in the fourth century (Pol. 1291b14), while\npossibly consistent with other forms of government, makes most sense\nif Tarentum was a democracy. The same is true of fr. B3 of Archytas,\nwith its emphasis on a more equal distribution of wealth.\n",
