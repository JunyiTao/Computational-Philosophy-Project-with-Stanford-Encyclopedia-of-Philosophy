In religious literature, there is a\nlong history of expressions of annoyance, anxiety, and despair over\ndivine hiddenness, so understood. For example, ancient Hebrew texts\nlament God\u2019s failure to show up in experience or to show proper\nregard for God\u2019s people or some particular person, and two\nChristian Gospels portray Jesus, in his cry of dereliction on the\ncross, as experiencing abandonment by God, whom he regarded as\n\u201cAbba, Father\u201d, an experience shared by many mystics,\nsaints, and ordinary folk of all theistic traditions, described at its\nworst as \u201cthe dark night of the soul\u201d. Understood in this\nway, divine hiddenness poses an existential problem for those who have\nsuch experiences.\n\nHowever, \u201cdivine hiddenness\u201d refers to something else in\nrecent philosophical literature, especially since the publication of\nJ.L. Schellenberg\u2019s landmark book, Divine Hiddenness and\nHuman Reason (1993). In this context, it refers to alleged facts\nabout the absence of belief in God\u2019s existence, on the basis of which\none might think there is no God. For example, Schellenberg argues\nthat, since there are nonbelievers who are capable of a personal\nrelationship with God and who do not resist it, there is no perfectly\nloving God, while Stephen Maitzen argues that naturalism better\nexplains the \u201cdemographics\u201d of nonbelief than theism and\nJason Marsh argues that naturalism better explains \u201cnatural\nnonbelief\u201d than theism. Understood in this way, divine\nhiddenness constitutes putative evidence for atheism.\n\nAlthough some of the recent philosophical literature addresses the\nproblem understood in the first way (e.g., DeWeese-Boyd 2016; Garcia\n2002; Nagasawa 2015), this entry focuses on divine hiddenness\nunderstood in the second way. The first section discusses the\nrelationships between nonbelief and another source of alleged evidence\nfor atheism: evil. The second section states and defends the argument\nfrom nonresistant nonbelief. The third section sketches attempts to\nexplain nonresistant nonbelief from a theistic perspective. The fourth\nsection states other responses to the argument from nonresistant\nnonbelief. The fifth section discusses the argument from the\ndemographics of nonbelief and the sixth section discusses the argument\nfrom natural nonbelief.\n", "toc": [{"#RelaBetwNonbEvil": "1.

Relationships between nonbelief and evil\n\nSeveral relationships between nonbelief and evil appear when we view\nthem as providing evidence for atheism.\n\n(A) It is customary to distinguish \u201clogical\u201d\n(\u201cdeductive\u201d) arguments from evil from\n\u201cevidential\u201d (\u201cinductive\u201d,\n\u201cabductive\u201d, \u201cprobabilistic\u201d) arguments from\nevil. There are different ways to draw that distinction. On one way\n(Howard-Snyder 1996c), a logical argument from evil affirms of some\nknown fact about evil that it is incompatible with theism (e.g.,\nMackie 1955; Schellenberg 2007a), while an evidential argument from\nevil does not\u2014either because it affirms that the fact in\nquestion, although incompatible with theism, is not known but only\nreasonably believed to be the case (e.g., Rowe 1979), or because it\naffirms that the fact in question, though known, is more unlikely on\ntheism than on some competing hypothesis (e.g., Draper 1989; Oppy\n2013). Likewise for nonbelief. A logical argument from nonbelief\naffirms of some known fact about nonbelief that it is incompatible\nwith the existence of God (Drange 1998), while an evidential argument\nfrom nonbelief does not\u2014either because it affirms that the fact\nin question, although incompatible with theism, is not known but only\nreasonably believed (Schellenberg 1993, 2015), or because it affirms\nthat the fact in question, though known, is more unlikely on theism\nthan on some competing hypothesis (Maitzen 2006; Marsh 2013; Anderson\nand Russell forthcoming).\n\n(B) It is a matter of dispute whether nonbelief provides evidence for\natheism independently of evil. Those in favor of independence invite\nus to imagine a world with no pain, suffering, or moral\nvice/wrongdoing. No one in such a world would appeal to evil as\nevidence for atheism, but someone might appeal to nonbelief as\nevidence for atheism (van Inwagen 2002, 2008; Schellenberg 2010a).\nThose in favor of dependence tend to define \u201cevil\u201d more\nbroadly. For example, they might say that evils are just bad states of\naffairs, whether pain, suffering, or moral vice/wrongdoing, on the one\nhand, or nonbelief, on the other hand (Kvanvig 2002; Evans 2010).\nAlternatively, they might argue in an Augustinian spirit that, since\nevil just is a lack of a good that should exist, and since belief in\nGod\u2019s existence is a good that should exist, nonbelief is an\nevil. One can also affirm that nonbelief is evidence for atheism in\nthe absence of evil while still thinking that the evidential value of\nnonbelief in this world must account for its interaction with the\nexistence of suffering (Anderson and Russell forthcoming). Indeed, one\nmight argue that the interaction is this: if God has a reason to allow\nevil, then God has a reason to allow something to act as a defeater\nfor belief in God\u2019s existence (Dumsday 2016).\n\n(C) Even if nonbelief provides evidence for atheism independently of\nevil, critical responses to arguments from nonbelief and evil share\nimportant similarities. For example, just as some critics try to\nexplain why God permits evil, so some critics try to explain why God\npermits nonbelief. Moreover, just as some critics argue that we are in\nno position to say that there are no unknown reasons for God to permit\nevil, so some critics argue that we are in no position to say that\nthere are no unknown reasons for God to permit nonbelief. Furthermore,\njust as some critics deny the relevant facts about evil, so some\ncritics deny the relevant facts about nonbelief. In addition, just as\nsome people say evil provides evidence against theism only if we\nconceive of God in certain ways, and so we should conceive of God\ndifferently, so some people say that nonbelief provides evidence\nagainst theism only if we conceive of God in certain ways, and so we\nshould conceive of God differently. Finally, just as some people grant\nthat evil gives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things\ngive theism much more weight, so some people grant that nonbelief\ngives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things give theism\nmuch more weight.\n\n(D) We can see another connection between arguments from evil and\nnonbelief by way of one of William Rowe\u2019s evidential arguments\nfrom evil. Obviously enough, there is horrific suffering in the world;\nbut, says Rowe, God exists only if there is a reason for God to permit\nsuch suffering. However, since there is no reason that we know of,\nit\u2019s reasonable to infer that there is no reason, period (Rowe\n1979). Thus, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that God does not exist.\nSome critics question the reasonableness of Rowe\u2019s inference\nfrom \u201cthere is no reason we know of\u201d to \u201cthere is no\nreason, period\u201d, on the grounds that it assumes that we are in a\ngood position to tell whether there is a reason, an assumption they\nregard as dubious since it would not be the least bit surprising if\nthere were a reason that was accessible to God but not to us. These\ncritics are too quick, however. For we must distinguish two ways in\nwhich we might be in a good position to tell whether something exists.\nThe first way is direct: we are in a position to see or mentally\napprehend it for ourselves. The second way is indirect: although we\nare not in a good position to see or mentally apprehend it for\nourselves, we are in a good position to see or apprehend something\nelse and, seeing or apprehending that other thing, we are in a good\nposition to infer reasonably that the first thing exists. The critics\nare too quick because they ignore the second, indirect way in which we\nmight be in a good position to tell whether something exists. This is\nwhere nonbelief might come into play. For one might argue that if\nGod\u2019s reasons for permitting a person to undergo horrific\nsuffering were inaccessible to them, then God would make it clear to\nthem that there is such a reason through clear assurances of\nGod\u2019s love and care, clear enough so that they are in a good\nposition to believe that God has a reason to permit their suffering.\nBut many people who suffer do not believe that God has a reason to\npermit their suffering, not least because they do not believe that God\nexists. So it is that nonbelief arguably vindicates Rowe\u2019s\nassumption and inference (Bergmann 2001; Howard-Snyder 1992, 1996b;\nRowe 2001; Trakakis 2007b).\n\n(E) An additional connection between evil and nonbelief consists in\ntrying to use various theistically friendly explanations of the facts\nabout evil to address concerns regarding the facts about nonbelief\nand, conversely, trying to use various theistically friendly\nexplanations of the facts about nonbelief to address concerns\nregarding the facts about evil. For example, one might argue that just\nas deep responsibility for each other\u2019s wellbeing explains\nGod\u2019s permission of some sin and suffering, so it explains\nGod\u2019s permission of some nonbelief (Swinburne 1998). Or,\nalternatively, if there is a good reason for God to permit nonbelief,\nthen God also has good reason not to intervene systematically to\nprevent or undo the consequences of wrongdoing (for if God did so\nintervene, God\u2019s existence would be clear enough to prevent\nnonbelief), and so God has some reason to permit some of the suffering\nthat is a natural consequence of wrongdoing (Dumsday 2015c).\n\n(F) Just as we must distinguish evil providing an argumentative basis\nfor atheism from evil providing a non-argumentative basis for atheism,\nso we must distinguish nonbelief providing an argumentative basis for\natheism from nonbelief providing a non-argumentative basis for\natheism. In the case of evil, this might work by\n\u201cseeing right there in the evil that the world was\nGodless or that the evil was so repugnant as to be irredeemable\u201d\n(Gellman 2013: 11). Likewise, in the case of nonbelief, this might\nwork by seeing right there in the nonresistant nonbeliever that the\nworld was Godless or that the nonresistant nonbelief was so repugnant\nas to be divinely impermissible.\n2. The argument from nonresistant nonbelief\n\nMore than anyone else, Schellenberg has shaped the contemporary debate over arguments from nonbelief. The main argument from his 1993 book can be stated as follows:\n\n(1) There are\npeople who are capable of relating personally to God but who, through\nno fault of their own, fail to believe. \n(2) If there\nis a personal God who is unsurpassably great, then there are no such\npeople. \n(3) So, there\nis no such God (from 1 and 2). \n\n\nFor the defense of premise (2), Schellenberg\u2019s reasoning\nprovides the following subargument:\n\n(2a) If there\nis a personal God who is unsurpassably great, then there is a personal\nGod who is unsurpassably loving. \n(2b) If there\nis a personal God who is unsurpassably loving, then for any human\nperson H and any time t, if H is at\nt capable of relating personally to God, H has it\nwithin H\u2019s power at t to do so (i.e., will do\nso, just by choosing), unless H is culpably in a contrary\nposition at t. \n(2c) For any\nhuman person H and any time t, H has it\nwithin H\u2019s power at t to relate personally to\nGod only if H at t believes that God exists.\n\n(2d) So, if\nthere is a personal God who is unsurpassably great, then for any human\nperson H and any time t, if H is at\nt capable of relating personally to God, H at\nt believes that God exists, unless H is culpably in\na contrary position at t (from 2a through 2c). \n\n\n(2d) is tantamount to premise\n (2)\n of the main argument.\n\nIn his post-1993 writings, Schellenberg clarifies that he means his\nclaims about God, love, and relationship to be necessary truths.\nMoreover, the main argument of his 2007a replaces talk of\n\u201cculpability\u201d with talk of \u201cresistance\u201d.\n(\u201cI now see this focus on culpability and inculpability as a\nmistake\u201d; 2015a: 54.) And he emphasizes \u201cmeaningful\nconscious relationship\u201d. Finally, his 2015a and 2015b focus on\nthe \u201copenness\u201d of \u201ca perfectly loving God\u201d to\n\u201cpositively meaningful\u201d and \u201creciprocal conscious\nrelationship\u201d. Thus, the latest version of the argument\n(slightly condensed):\n\n(4)\nNecessarily, if God exists, then God perfectly loves such finite\npersons as there may be.\n(5)\nNecessarily, if God perfectly loves such finite persons as there may\nbe, then, for any capable finite person S and time\nt, God is at t open to being in a positively\nmeaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with S at\nt.\n(6)\nNecessarily, if for any capable finite person S and time t,\nGod is at t open to being in a positively meaningful and\nreciprocal conscious relationship with S at t, then,\nfor any capable finite person S and time t, it is\nnot the case that S is at t nonresistantly in a\nstate of nonbelief in relation to the proposition that God\nexists.\n(7) There is\nat least one capable finite person S and time t such\nthat S is or was at t nonresistantly in a state of\nnonbelief in relation to the proposition that God exists.\n(8) So, it is\nnot the case that God exists. (from 4 through 7)\n\n\nWe turn now to Schellenberg\u2019s defense of his premises.\n\nSchellenberg argues for premise\n (4)\n on the basis of what he calls ultimism, the proposition that\nthere is a reality that is ultimate in three ways. A\nmetaphysically ultimate reality, he says, \n\nis something whose existence is the ultimate or most fundamental fact\nabout the nature of things, in terms of which any other fact about\nwhat things exist and how they exist would have to be explained in a\ncomprehensive and correct account. \n\nAn axiologically ultimate reality \u201cembod[ies] the\ndeepest possible value\u201d, and \u201cwould have to be the\ngreatest possible reality\u201d. A soteriologically ultimate\nreality is a reality in relation to which \u201cthe deepest or\nultimate human good can be attained\u201d (2015a: 19\u201321). The\nidea of a personal reality that is triply ultimate\u2014that\nis, the idea of God in western philosophy, says Schellenberg\u2014is\nthe idea of the greatest possible person; and, all else being\nequal, a person perfect in love would be an \u201cimprovement\u201d\nover a person that was not perfect in love (2015a: 89\u2013103;\nSchellenberg 2005d).\n\nAs for premise\n (5),\n suppose God perfectly loves Anna. That love would minimally involve\nbenevolence, caring for Anna\u2019s well-being. But it would also\ninvolve aiming \u201cat relationship\u2014a conscious and reciprocal\nrelationship that is positively meaningful, allowing for a deep\nsharing\u201d between them. Moreover, it would involve valuing that\nrelationship for its own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else. Furthermore, it would never cease, and so God would\nalways value, seek, desire, promote, or preserve personal relationship\nwith Anna, although God would not force himself on her. At the very\nleast, says Schellenberg, all this requires that God will always be\nopen to personal relationship with her (2015b:\n17\u201322).\n\nThis notion of openness with those who are capable of\nit\u2014that is, with those who possess the cognitive and affective\nproperties required to participate in a personal relationship, which,\nin the case of God, would involve such things as a capacity to feel\nthe presence of God, recognizing it as such; a capacity to exhibit\nattitudes of trust, gratitude, and obedience to God, and so on (2015b:\n21n15)\u2014is crucial. Schellenberg writes:\n\nIf one is always open in the sense I intend then, even if one does not\nactively seek or promote personal relationship with another person\ncapable of participating in such relationship\u2026, one makes sure\nthat there is nothing one ever does (in a broad sense including\nomissions) that would have the result of making such relationship\nunavailable to the other, preventing her from being able to\nrelate personally to one, even should she then try. So for God to\nalways be open to personal relationship with a relevantly capable\ncreated person such as Anna in a manner expressing unsurpassable love\nis for God to ensure that there is never something God does\nthat prevents her from being able, just by trying, to participate in\npersonal relationship with God\u2026. Anna may not want relationship\nor even to be reminded of her religious options, and so may through\nresistance of God, which would have to involve self-deception, herself\nproduce a situation in which she is unable to relate personally to\nGod, just like that, without first undoing the behaviour that led to\nit. But unless Anna is resistant in this way at a time, she will find\nit possible to participate in personal relationship with God, and to\ndo so then. Never will she find the door to such relationship closed.\nThis, at the very minimum, is required if God unsurpassably loves Anna\nin a manner aimed at personal relationship with her. (2015b: 21,\nsubstituting \u201cAnna\u201d for \u201cP\u201d)\n\n\nExpanding on what he means by \u201cresistance of God\u201d,\nSchellenberg tells us that if we think\n\nfirst about love and then about openness and then about what it would\ntake for God to allow someone not to be in a position to participate\nin a personal relationship with the divine, we will see that a sort of\nfree resistance sufficient to make it the case that we ourselves have\nshut the door to any relationship with God that might be on offer\nwould be required. To trade in one metaphor for another, if God is\nopen to personal relationship then the divine light will remain on\nunless we close our eyes\u2026. We might imagine a resister wanting\nto do her own thing without considering God\u2019s view of the\nmatter, or wanting to do something she regards as in fact contrary to\nthe values cultivated in a relationship with God. But it would also\ninvolve actions or omissions (at least mental ones) in\nsupport of such desire\u2026. Here we might imagine careless\ninvestigation of one sort or another in relation to the existence of\nGod, or someone deliberately consorting with people who carelessly\nfail to believe in God and avoiding those who believe, or just over\ntime mentally drifting, with her own acquiescence, away from any place\nwhere she could convincingly be met by evidence of God. (2015:\n55\u201356)\n\n\nOf course, there are many other ways in which one might \u201cshut\nthe door\u201d or \u201cclose one\u2019s eyes\u201d and, as a\nresult, lack belief in God\u2019s existence.\n\nAs for\n (6),\n by Schellenberg\u2019s lights, Anna could not even begin to be in a\npositively meaningful, personal relationship with God unless she\nbelieved that God exists. Why? Because\n\na personal relationship is a conscious, reciprocal relationship, and a\nconscious relationship is a relationship one recognizes oneself to be\nin. Given these facts, one clearly cannot even get started in a\npersonal relationship without believing that the other party\nexists. Now belief, as most contemporary philosophers would\nagree, is involuntary in the sense that one cannot choose to believe\nsomething at a time just by trying to. So by God\u2019s not revealing\nGod\u2019s existence, God is doing something that makes it impossible\nfor Anna to participate in personal relationship with God at the\nrelevant time just by trying, and this, according to our definition of\nopenness, is precisely what is involved in God\u2019s not being open\nto having such a relationship with Anna then. (2015b: 23, substituting\n\u201cGod\u201d and \u201cAnna\u201d for \u201cB\u201d\nand \u201cA\u201d)\n\n\nThe upshot is that, if God is open to being in a positively\nmeaningful, reciprocal, and conscious relationship with Anna, then, at\nany time that she is capable of such a relationship, Anna will believe\nthat God exists\u2014unless she has done something that results in\nher being resistant to such a relationship at that time.\n\nAlthough Schellenberg emphasizes the point that perfect love seeks\nrelationships for their own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else, there are additional benefits one should bear in mind\nthat may be jeopardized by divine hiddenness. For consider the\nbenefits to Anna if she were in a positively meaningful, explicit,\nreciprocal conscious relationship with God, even if just one that was\ndevelopmentally in its infancy. First, there would be moral benefits,\ne.g., she would be able to draw on the resources of that relationship\nto overcome flaws in her character, and so she would be more likely to\nemulate the self-giving love with which she was loved, and thus more\nlikely to flourish as a finite person. Second, there would be\nexperiential benefits. She would be, e.g., more likely to experience\npeace and joy stemming from her belief that she is properly related to\nher Maker, and security in believing that, ultimately, all shall be\nwell even if she suffers in the meantime; and she would have the\nprofound pleasure of God\u2019s loving presence. As a consequence of\nthese moral and experiential benefits, Anna\u2019s relationships with\nothers would likely improve (Schellenberg 1993: 19ff).\n\nAs for the empirical\n premise\u2014(7),\n and the earlier\n (1)\u2014Schellenberg\n generalizes from (a) honest seekers of the truth who remain agnostics\nand atheists, including those whose search leads them to convert to\nnontheistic religions, (b) members of cultures that lack the idea of a\npersonal God altogether, e.g., the Chinese in the period from the\nbeginning of their history until the Christian Middle Ages, (c)\nhunter-gatherers prior to recorded history, and (d) those who have\nlost their theistic faith, and who would like nothing more than to\nregain it. Furthermore, Schellenberg appeals to increased secularity,\nespecially in Western cultures: what is the probability that\nall of the hundreds of millions of nonbelievers in the\nsecular West are, at the dawn of their capacity to relate personally\nwith God, resistant? Vanishingly small (2015: 76ff; 2007a: 205,\n228ff).\n3. Attempts to explain nonresistant nonbelief theistically\n\nIt follows from Schellenberg\u2019s premises\n (4)\u2013(6)\n that, necessarily, if God exists, then, for any capable finite person\nS and time t, it is not the case that S is\nat t nonresistantly in a state of nonbelief in relation to\nthe proposition that God exists. In short, God\u2019s existence\nentails there\u2019s never any nonresistant nonbelief. To assess this\nimplication we must assess the premises from which it follows. In this\nsection, we focus on premise\n (5)\n and a particular kind of assessment, something analogous to theodicy\nin the literature on the problem of evil. To help us keep our focus,\nsuppose we grant premises\n (4)\n and\n (6).\n Moreover, since we want to assess premise\n (5)\n from as sympathetic a position as we can, suppose we grant\nSchellenberg\u2019s claim that one is open to a positively\nmeaningful, reciprocal, and conscious relationship with another, in a\nmanner consistent with perfect love, only if one never does anything\n(by commission or omission) that would result in the other being\nprevented from participating in that relationship, just by trying.\nGiven these suppositions, we might wonder whether it is possible that\nGod perfectly loves such finite persons as there may be and yet, for\nat least some of them, God does something (by commission or omission)\nthat results in them lacking belief in God\u2019s\nexistence\u2014even though they have the capacity for a positively\nmeaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with God and they are\nnot in a state of resistance to God. In particular, we might wonder\nwhether there are any reasons for a perfectly loving God to\ndo something (by commission or omission) that would result in\nnonresistant nonbelief in persons who are capable of relating\npersonally with God in this way.\n\nThere are many cases of this type to wonder about. Here are two.\nFirst, imagine someone who has always lacked belief and who has always\nlacked the capacity to relate personally with God but who is,\nnonetheless, nonresistant to God. Such a person might be a child who\nis at the dawn of her capacity to relate personally with God. Might\nthere be good enough reason, consistent with perfect love, for God to\ndo something (by commission or omission) that results in her being\nprevented from belief, even as she transitions to being capable of\nrelating personally with God while remaining nonresistant? Second,\nimagine a man who has had the capacity to relate personally with God\nfor some time, and who was once a fulfilled nonresistant believer but\nwho, for one reason or another, is now in a state of resistant\nnonbelief. Many a university student might satisfy this description,\namong others. Might there be good enough reason, consistent with\nperfect love, for God to do something (by commission or omission) that\nresults in that man being prevented from belief in God\u2019s\nexistence even as, later in life, he transitions back to being\nnonresistant?\n\nAffirmative answers to these questions involve reasons for thinking it\nwould be better if they remained nonbelievers, at least for a time,\ndespite their transitions. For example, what if the child never ever\nexercised any influence over whether she was nonresistant to God?\nPerhaps, in that case, it would be better\u2014for her, and for God,\nand for their forthcoming relationship\u2014if she were first to own\nher good disposition toward God through choices in the face of\ncontrary inclinations, so that, among other things, her loving and\nobeying God was of her own accord when she came to believe. Or perhaps\nher non-resistance to God is grounded in improper motives, e.g., fear\nof punishment, a desire for parental approval or social acceptance,\nand the like, and so God gives her the opportunity to change her\nmotives so that, upon coming to believe, her love and obedience are\nmore properly motivated (Howard-Snyder 1996a, 2015; cf. Schellenberg\n2017a). Or perhaps her moral autonomy, freedom, or moral development\nwould be objectionably thwarted or reduced if God were to bring her to\nbelief at this time (Hick 1966; Murray 2002; Paytas 2017, 2019;\nSwinburne 1979). Or perhaps, despite her non-resistance, if she came\nto belief now instead of later, the passion and intensity of her\ndesire for God would be significantly less than it otherwise would be.\nOr perhaps she is disposed, upon coming to believe now, to think she\nhas arrived at a proper understanding of God, and she would become\ncomplacent or relate to God at a superficial level. (Kierkegaard 1844:\n28\u201329, 33\u201335; cf. Schellenberg 1993: 160ff). Or perhaps\ncertain intellectual temptations would be lost on her if she were to\nbelieve now, and so she would not have the opportunity to respond to\nthem virtuously (Butler 1736: part 2, chapter 6; cf. Schellenberg\n1993: 168ff). Or perhaps upon coming to believe now, she would be\nresentful or envious of God\u2019s glory and greatness (Dumsday\n2012a). Or what if the university student, despite his forthcoming\nreturn to non-resistance, was disposed to relate to God in\npresumptuous or arrogant ways upon regaining belief, and not with due\ncontrition and humility, both of which are essential to a proper\nrelationship with God? Or what if he was disposed to be significantly\nless apt to recognize the wretchedness of living life on his own,\nwithout God, if he were to regain belief now instead of later? (Pascal\n1670, Fragments 234, 378, 427, 446, 449; cf. Schellenberg 1993:\n136ff). Or what if God does not bring him to belief because he is\nill-disposed to the sort of moral transformation God intends for him,\nor he\u2019s into having a relationship with God just for the\npleasure and titillation of it? (Dumsday 2014b; Moser 2002, 2008b) Or\nwhat if God does not bring him to belief because, as a general policy,\nGod permits some people in positions like his to continue in nonbelief\nin order to increase diverse expressions of religious imagination,\ncreativity, and devotion, or in order to increase opportunities for\npeople to pursue knowledge of important matters together, even\nknowledge as important as knowledge of God, or in order to promote\nassisting each other in starting personal relationships with God\n(Dumsday 2010b; Schellenberg 1993: 181ff; Swinburne 1998); or because,\nunder present circumstances, bringing all non-resistant believers to\nbelief would force the truth of theism on the resistant (Dumsday\n2016a)? And there are other explanations offered as well.\n\nSeveral points have emerged in the literature with respect to\nassessing these reasons or explanations.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s doubtful that any single one of them offers a total\nexplanation of nonresistant nonbelief. Different kinds of nonresistant\nnonbelievers, given the rest of their psychology, might call for\ndifferent explanations. Moreover, each of these explanations, taken\nalone, might fail to provide a total explanation of any particular\nkind or instance of nonresistant nonbelief, and yet each of them might\nprovide a partial explanation and, taken together with others, add up\nto a total explanation. At least this is a possibility that must not\nbe overlooked. Thus, if we are to reject these explanations, and\nothers that might be proffered, we must claim that they fail,\ncollectively as well as individually, to account for why God might\npermit nonresistant nonbelief.\n\nSecond, in light of the foregoing point, even if there are some\nnonresistant nonbelievers, it may well be quite difficult to discern\nwhether they possess or fail to possess those motivations, attitudes,\nand dispositions that allegedly explain their nonbelief in a\ntheistically friendly fashion. If the difficulty is severe enough,\nthen it might be that no one\u2014whether theists, atheists,\nagnostics, or what-have-you\u2014is well-positioned to say that there\nare some nonresistant nonbelievers.\n\nOf course\u2014and this is the third point\u2014we might well argue\nthat these explanations provide no good reason, individually or\ncollectively, for God to permit nonresistant nonbelief. That\u2019s\nbecause the good states of affairs to which they appeal can be\naccommodated within a developing, positively meaningful, reciprocal,\nand conscious relationship with God, or because the benefits of such a\nrelationship with God exceed the goods to which these explanations\nappeal, or because, more generally, this sort of relationship with God\nis the greatest good and so God wouldn\u2019t pursue lesser goods at\nits expense (Bozzo 2019; Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002a; Schellenberg\n1993, 1996, 2005a, 2005b, 2007a, 2015a, 2017a; McBrayer and Swenson\n2012; Teeninga 2017, 2019, 2020; Trakakis 2007a).\n\nFourth, one might worry that the whole enterprise of providing a\ntheistically friendly explanation of nonresistant nonbelief is\nmisguided. After all, if God exists, why didn\u2019t God create a\nworld in which there never was or ever will be any nonresistant\nnonbelief? Why would God create or permit resisters and nonbelievers\nin the first place? Surely he could have created persons who never\nresisted and always believed.\n4. Other assessments of the argument from nonresistant nonbelief\n\nEven if no theistically friendly explanation of nonresistant nonbelief\nwe know of completely satisfies us, we might yet wonder about\nSchellenberg\u2019s premise\n (4):\n necessarily, if God exists, then God perfectly loves such finite\npersons as there may be.\n\nOn the one hand, we might wonder whether, if God exists, God perfectly\nloves anyone. In this connection, some critics have pointed\nout that many \u201cclassical theists\u201d affirm a conception of\nGod according to which God is transcendent, ineffable, and/or\nextracategorical, and so beyond all human comprehension, and so\nneither personal nor non-personal, and so neither loving nor\nnon-loving (Rea 2015; Ross 2002; Trakakis 2015; Wojtysiak 2021). It is\ncertainly less than clear whether a conscious, reciprocal personal\nrelationship with the God of apophaticism is possible and, even if it\nis possible, whether it would count as \u201cmeaningful\u201d in Schellenberg\u2019s\nsense (Howard-Snyder 2017a, 2017b; Rea 2016, 2018). Moreover, even if\nthere is a personal God, God might be indifferent to finite created\npersons, and so not love them\u2014an implication of some versions of\nDeism.\n\nOn the other hand, we might wonder whether, even if God is perfect in\nlove, God would perfectly love such finite persons as there may be.\nFor, in light of an idea suggested as worthy of consideration by Hud\nHudson in private correspondence, \n\nto love perfectly is for one\u2019s love to be in the right\nproportion to the object of one\u2019s love, everything\nconsidered\u2014loving to the degree that matches the degree of\nworthiness to be loved. \n\nTherefore, even if God is perfectly loving, it does not follow that\nGod loves such finite persons as there may be since they may have\npolluted themselves, rendered themselves utterly unlovable; \u201cand\nit is, of course, no symptom of a disordered love to fail to love the\nunlovable\u201d.\n\nOne might also wonder about premise\n (5):\n necessarily, if God perfectly loves such finite persons as there may\nbe, then, for any capable finite person S and time\nt, God is at t open to being in a positively\nmeaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with S at\nt. Whether this is true might depend on what sort of love is\nperfect, whether it is more like that of a mother for her child, or a\ngrandparent for her distant descendants, or a benevolent\nreconstructive surgeon for her patient (Cuneo 2013; McGinnis 2015; Rea\n2015; Schellenberg 2013). One might argue that premise\n (5)\n is true only if perfect love is like the first, but wonder what\nfollows if it is like the second or third. In this connection, imagine\nthat what it is for God to perfectly love us is for God to provide for\nour greatest good, and suppose that our greatest good consists in our\nbeing virtuous, caring for our environment and other creatures. In\nthat case, it is not at all clear that openness to a personal\nrelationship of the sort Schellenberg imagines is necessary. So long\nas God has made our flourishing achievable, that is all that\nGod\u2019s perfect love should lead us to expect. In a similar vein,\none might argue that \u201cGod loves every human but loves some more\nthan others,\u201d and so \u201cGod would not seek the same for each\nperson as lovers do not act impartially between those most loved and\nothers whom they love,\u201d and so a \u201cvariable divine\nlove\u201d does not require \u201cthat God would always be open to a\npersonal relationship with every person\u201d (Jordan 2021; see\nSchellenberg 2021b for criticism).\n\nFurthermore, one might call into question why God\u2019s love should\nbe our only guide as to whether God would be open to a positively\nmeaningful, reciprocal, conscious relationship. God\u2019s\ntranscendence (Rea 2016, 2018) and/or personality (Rea 2012, 2018; for\ncritique, see Parker 2012, Schellenberg 2017a) might jointly\ndetermine, along with God\u2019s perfect love, the extent to which\nGod is thus open.\n\nSuppose we grant Schellenberg\u2019s understanding of openness to\nrelationship as well as his premise\n (6),\n and suppose we concede that no theistically friendly explanation of\nnonresistant nonbelief we know of is wholly satisfactory, either\nindividually or collectively. Even so, we might wonder whether we\nshould infer that a perfectly loving God would not permit nonresistant\nnonbelief. After all, an open-minded and intellectually humble\ninquirer will want to satisfy her natural curiosity about whether she\nis in a position to tell whether there are any reasons for God to\npermit nonresistant nonbelief that, although inaccessible to her,\nwould be accessible to God. For suppose that she were to discover\nthat, even if there is no good basis for thinking there is a God, and\neven if she does not know of any wholly satisfactory reason for God to\npermit nonresistant nonbelief, she should be in doubt about whether\nshe is in a position to tell whether there are any unknown reasons. In\nthat case, we would expect her open-mindedness and intellectual\nhumility to lead her to refrain from accepting that a perfectly loving\nGod would not permit nonresistant nonbelief and, in refraining from\naccepting this, she would refrain from accepting premise\n (5).\n\nThis assessment of the argument from nonbelief has its parallel in the\nproblem of evil literature where it is (badly) named \u201cskeptical\ntheism\u201d. It has been explicitly used in relation to the argument\nfrom nonbelief in Howard-Snyder 2015 and McBrayer and Swenson 2012.\nFor criticism, see Schellenberg 2007a, 2015b. Whether this assessment\nleads to objectionable skepticism elsewhere is a matter of ongoing\ndebate. For discussion as it relates to the argument from evil, see\nDougherty 2014; Dougherty and McBrayer 2014; Howard-Snyder 2009;\nMcBrayer 2010; McBrayer and Howard-Snyder 2013; and Trakakis\n2007b.\n\nEven if we accept premises\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n we might yet wonder about Schellenberg\u2019s premise\n (6),\n the claim that God\u2019s openness to a personal relationship with\ncapable nonresistant persons entails that such persons will believe\nthat God exists. Schellenberg argues that a person cannot even\n\u201cget started\u201d in a personal\nrelationship\u2014specifically, a conscious, reciprocal, positively\nmeaningful relationship with another person\u2014without believing\nthat the other person exists. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he says,\n\u201ca personal relationship is a conscious, reciprocal\nrelationship, and a conscious relationship is a relationship one\nrecognizes oneself to be in,\u201d and so \u201cone clearly cannot\neven get started in a personal relationship without believing that the\nother party exists\u201d (Schellenberg 2021a, 64). \n\nOne might wonder, however, whether one could bring to one\u2019s\nconscious awareness a relationship that one is in without\nbelieving the proposition that the other person\nexists, for two reasons. First, perhaps one could bring to\none\u2019s conscious awareness a relationship that one is in while\nbeing in a kind of psychological state toward the proposition that the\nother person exists other than propositional belief, e.g., credence,\nconfidence, acceptance, propositional trust, propositional hope, or\nbeliefless assuming, as well as non-doxastic faith. Second, perhaps\none could bring to one\u2019s conscious awareness a relationship that\none is in while believing a proposition that is \u201cthinner\u201d\nthan the \u201cthick\u201d proposition that the other person\nexists, e.g., the proposition that the other person probably\nexists, or the proposition that it\u2019s more likely than\nnot that the other person exists, or the proposition that its\nlikely enough that the other person exists to act on it. And\nthere are other options for believing \u201cthinner\u201d\npropositions as well. (For more on these optional psychological\nstates, see Alston 1996; Audi 2011; Buchak 2018; Cohen 1992;\nHoward-Snyder 2013, 2016; Howard-Snyder and McKaughan 2022; McKaughan\n2013; McKaughan and Howard-Snyder forthcoming; Poston and Dougherty\n2007; Schellenberg 2011, 2014; Weidner 2018.) Thus, perhaps one might\n\u201cget started\u201d in a personal relationship with God\u2014a\nconscious, reciprocal, positively meaningful personal love\nrelationship with God\u2014without believing that God exists,\nprovided that, e.g., one has non-doxastic faith that God exists and/or\none believes that it\u2019s likely enough that God exists to act on\nit. Indeed, one may well wonder whether propositional belief that God\nexists would be all that important to God since so many people lack\nsuch belief (van Inwagen 2002; Megill and Linford 2017).\n\nFurther pressure has been put on premise (6). Some have recently urged\nthat non-propositional knowledge of persons is strongly differentiable\nfrom propositional knowledge about those persons, perhaps not even\nrequiring the belief that they exist (Benton 2018; Stump 2018, 2021).\nIf that\u2019s possible, then, perhaps, persons capable of a\nconscious, reciprocal, positively meaningful personal relationship\nwith God can have such a relationship without believing that God\nexists. (For critique, see Sweet 2022.) \n\nSome have also recently urged against premise (6) the following\nargument. It is possible for God to be in a conscious, reciprocal,\npositively meaningful personal relationship with created persons in a\nsui generis fashion, specifically, in an \u201cimaging\nrelationship\u201d (Yadav 2020). An imaging relationship is one in\nwhich God creates persons in God\u2019s image\u2014i.e., persons\n\u201cwho, like God, are constituted as minds and wills, and like God\nare capable of employing mind and will to serve the best interests of\ncreation\u201d (76)\u2014and then invites them, through the beauty\nand goodness of creation, to image God well instead of badly, which,\namong other things, involves them doing well as cultivators and\nnurturers of, carers-for, and delighters in creation, and them\nenjoying \u201ca kind of communion with God, a kind of intimate\nsharing in the divine mind and will, so that [they] may come to find\nGod uniquely formed within [their] own individual personhood\u201d\n(77). And, closer inspection reveals that it is possible for created\npersons to be in a (de re) conscious, reciprocal, positively\nmeaningful personal love relationship of this sort with God, and yet\nnot be (de dicto) conscious that God exists, i.e., and yet be\na nonbeliever or even a disbeliever (78\u201381). And so it is\npossible for created persons to be in a conscious, reciprocal,\npositively meaningful personal relationship with God and yet not\nbelieve that God exists.\n\nJust for the sake of argument, suppose that psychological states other\nthan the propositional belief that God exists can suffice as whatever\ncognitive requirement for \u201cgetting started\u201d in a personal relationship\nwith God involves. We might yet wonder whether those other states are\nas good as belief that God exists as a cognitive foundation for a\npersonal relationship with God; and, if they are not, we might well\nquestion why a perfectly loving God provides less than the best on\nthis score. Furthermore, even if a perfectly loving God might permit\nless than the best on this score, perhaps we have just as good a\nreason to think that there are nonresistant people who are in none of\nthe optional psychological states who are capable of relating\npersonally with God as we do to think that there are nonresistant\nnonbelievers who are capable of relating personally with God\u2014in\nwhich case we can modify the latest version of his argument to absorb\nthe force of the point (Schellenberg 2007b, 2015b, 2021a).\n\nLast but not least, we might wonder about premise\n (7):\n are there really any nonresistant nonbelievers with a capacity to\nrelate personally with God? Some suggest that, if there are, there\naren\u2019t many; after all, everyone has good Pascalian reason to\nbelieve that God exists (Jackson 2016). Others say that everyone at\nleast implicitly believes in God, although not under the name\n\u201cGod\u201d or under a description they might recognize as\nbelonging to God (Wainwright 2002). Further, many religions hold that\nsome kind of basic knowledge of God is universal but can be\nsuppressed, sometimes called the \u201cnatural knowledge of\nGod\u201d (Green 2013). Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans claims that\n\u201csince the creation of the world God\u2019s invisible qualities\nhave been clearly seen\u201d. Calvin famously posits that there is a\nsensus divinitatis that provides us with at least a basic\nsense of the divine. According to Jonathan Edwards, there is\n\u201csufficient light for the knowledge of God\u201d, hence,\nnonbelievers must fail to believe \u201cdivine things\u201d owing to\n\u201ca dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish\ninsensibility of their truth and importance\u201d (quoted in\nWainwright 2002). This insensibility consists in a \u201cproneness to\nidolatry\u201d and a \u201cdisregard of eternal\nthings\u201d\u2014dispositions to ignore familiar and obvious\nconsiderations, to be swayed by ridicule and deference to people in\nauthority, to be prejudiced against religion, and so on, which impair\nthe God-given ability to reason properly about God. People bring such\nimpairments on themselves (Azadegan 2013a; Henry 2001, 2008; Lehe\n2004; Moroney 2000). Of course, one might argue that non-resistant\nnon-believers do not bring such impairments on themselves; rather,\nthey suffer from a \u201csignificant disability,\u201d i.e.,\n\u201cspiritual autism,\u201d that prevents them from experiencing\nGod personally, and so prevents them from belief in God\u2019s\nexistence (McFall 2016). Whether such a metaphor is apt or helpful,\nthough, depends in part on important questions in the philosophy of\ndisability, and one ought to be very careful not to misrepresent or\ninstrumentalize autistic persons.\n\nHowever, if we deny the existence of nonresistant nonbelievers, we\nmust square our denial with the evidence marshalled on behalf of their\nexistence (Schellenberg 2005c). Furthermore, some forms of resistant\nnon-belief should be deeply concerning for the theist, such as\npsychological resistance provoked by religious trauma and\ninterpersonal hurts generally (Green 2015; Rea 2018; Panchuk 2018).\nWhether because of suffering or hiddenness, the mere fact that\nnonbelief is resistant is not necessarily a boon to the theist.\n5. The argument from the demographics of nonbelief\n\nAccording to Maitzen (2006),\n\nContemporary demographic data illustrate the lopsided distribution of\ntheistic belief. The populace of Saudi Arabia is at least 95 percent\nMuslim and therefore at least 95 percent theistic, while the populace\nof Thailand is 95 percent Buddhist and therefore at most 5 percent\ntheistic\u2026. If those data are even roughly accurate, the\ndistribution of theistic belief is at least highly uneven between\nthose two countries, and they are hardly unique in this respect.\n(179\u2013180)\n\n\nOther countries and geographic regions display an uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief, even though it is not as stark as it is in\nThailand and Saudi Arabia (Pew 2012). According to Maitzen, even if we\ngrant, just for the sake of argument, the success of some of the\ntheistically friendly explanations of nonbelief in individuals, none\nof them explain the \u201cgeographic patchiness\u201d of nonbelief.\nThat\u2019s because those explanations invoke motivations, attitudes,\nand dispositions that \u201cdo not cluster by country or culture so\nas to show up twenty times more often in Thailand than in Saudi\nArabia\u201d (Maitzen 2006: 184). After all, it\u2019s not as though\nthe Thai are twenty times more likely than the Saudis to be resistant\nto belief in God\u2019s existence, or in need of prompting to\nrecognize the wretchedness of life without God, or in need of the sort\nof risk that\u2019s required of a passionate faith in God; it\u2019s\nnot as though the Thai are twenty times more likely than the Saudis,\nupon coming to believe in God\u2019s existence, to be coerced into\nlove, trust, and obedience, or disposed to act out of improper motives\nlike fear of punishment, or be presumptuous in their relationship with\nGod, and so on (2006: 180\u2013185). Indeed, even if we grant, just\nfor the sake of argument again, that there is great value in a\ndiversity of belief and nonbelief in God\u2019s existence, \n\nwhy doesn\u2019t this valuable diversity flourish within the cultures\nof Saudi Arabia and Thailand? Naturalistic explanations, including\ncultural and political explanations offered by social science, have an\neasier time of it,\n\n\ncompared to theistic explanations since, on naturalism, \n\nthe patchiness of theistic belief has everything to do with the\nnotoriously haphazard play of human culture and politics and nothing\nto do with God: the messy, uneven data have messy, uneven causes.\n(2006: 183)\n\n\nMoreover, it seems implausible that God would be selective in the way\nGod related to different people groups, as though God took\nconsiderably more pains to make sure that those in the Middle East,\nrather than Thailand or China or India, came to belief. One would\nantecedently expect that God would have the motivation and wherewithal\nto treat all people equally on this score, which is hard to square\nwith God\u2019s love and justice. So it is that the demographics of\nnonbelief are better explained naturalistically than theistically, and\nso those demographics constitute evidence for atheism (cf. Zagzebski\n1994).\n\nBy way of reply, Marsh (2008) draws on Molinism in order to display\nhow the demographics of nonbelief might be more likely on theism than\nMaitzen suggests. According to Molinism, God knows what free creatures\nwould freely do in counterfactual situations, and God uses this\ninformation in the way God governs the universe. So, suppose that God\nknew that (i) there is a group of persons P\n\nthat are such that, no matter what creative act God had performed, if\nPs had existed, Ps would have freely rejected God in\ntheir earthly lives\n\n\nhad they believed, and \u201cthose genuinely deprived of the\nopportunity to believe in God in this world\u201d belong to that\ngroup (2008: 467). Furthermore, since God knows that \n\nthese individuals wouldn\u2019t come to love Him short of something\nlike a beatific vision, God sequesters them in order to secure their\neventual conversion,\n\n\nin an afterlife. God\u2019s decision to sequester them \u201clargely\ncashes out in terms of the geographic circumstances in which they are\nplaced\u201d, and keeps them \u201cinnocent for a later time, when\nthey will be in a position truly to love God\u201d upon coming to\nbelief (2008: 468). Finally, suppose that, given the counterfactual\nprofiles of each individual essence, there is no better distribution\nof belief and nonbelief than the actual one. In this theistically\nfriendly hypothesis, the demographics of nonbelief are at least as\nexpectable on theism as naturalism. Likewise for a Calvinist\nexplanation: \n\nDeterminism is true and souls may be divided into two kinds, the Elect\nand the Non-Elect. The Elects\u2019 souls are born into societal\nsituations in which they are determined to come to the ante\nmortem beliefs necessary for salvation; the non-Elects\u2019 are\nborn into societal situations in which they\u2019re not, indeed\nthey\u2019re determined to fail to come to these beliefs. (Mawson\n2012: 191\u2013192)\n\n\nMany theists will find Molinist and Calvinist explanations unappealing\nsince they depend on middle knowledge and double predestination\nrespectively. But another difficulty is that the strategy appears, at\nleast at first glance, more than a little bit offensive. One of the\ngreat triumphs of modern ethics is the widespread acknowledgement of\nthe moral reprehensibility of considering some people groups inferior\nto others. Postulating that non-theistic populations are comprised of\npeople who wouldn\u2019t respond appropriately to God no matter what,\nin this life, seems to flout this insight; and postulating that\nnon-theistic populations are comprised of people who are elect to\neternal damnation might be seen in the same light. (For further\ndiscussion, see Maitzen 2008; Mawson 2009, 2012.)\n\nMawson 2012 argues that, on theism, the demographics of nonbelief are\nexpectable, given either of two auxiliary hypotheses. First, suppose\nGod wants everyone to believe, but God wants much more everyone to\nbelieve without God\u2019s having to interfere with the freedom of\npeople. Of course, one of the things that people can use their freedom\nto do is either to spread theistic belief or to restrict the spread of\ntheistic belief. Given that people\u2019s receptivity to theistic\nbelief is dependent on the culture in which they are brought up and so\nforth, we\u2019d expect to find that belief and nonbelief are\ndistributed unevenly. Second, what if God wants more than anything\neveryone to believe, say, because it is necessary for salvation? In\nthat case, we must ask what \u201cdeadline\u201d God has set for\nsatisfying that desire. Mawson writes: \n\nThere are two plausible suggestions for \u201cdeadlines\u201d for\nGod: either that he has set for each individual his or her own\ndeadline and set it as the moment of his or her death, or that he has\nset us collectively one and the same deadline, the Eschaton/Last\nJudgment. (2012: 194)\n\n\nIf God\u2019s \u201cdeadline\u201d is the Last Judgment, then, once\nagain, it\u2019s not the least bit surprising that, since\npeople\u2019s receptivity to theistic belief is dependent on the\nculture in which they are brought up and so forth, belief and\nnonbelief are distributed unevenly. Oddly enough, Mawson does not\nmention a third deadline, the one that Schellenberg has been on about\nfor nearly three decades: the dawn of an individual\u2019s capacity\nto relate personally with God. If that were God\u2019s\n\u201cdeadline\u201d, would we still expect the uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief we find across the globe?\n\nBaker-Hytch (2016) argues that the uneven distribution of belief and\nnonbelief is about as likely on theism as on naturalism since (i) the\nprobability of that distribution on what we know about \u201cmutual\nepistemic dependence\u201d is high, (ii) the probability of what we\nknow about mutual epistemic dependence on \u201cinclusive\ntheism\u201d\u2014the view that the eternal destiny of human beings\nis not determined by what they believe at their natural\ndeaths\u2014is about the same as it is on naturalism, and (iii) the\nprobability of inclusive theism on theism is much higher than is\nnon-inclusive theism. See Talbot 2014 for a Christian defense of\n(iii).\n\nTo say that we are mutually epistemically dependent is to say\nthat we are \n\ncognitively constituted in such a way that it is a practical necessity\nthat we rely upon testimony for much of what we know about the world\nand in such a way, moreover, that we are liable to be significantly\ninfluenced by what those around us believe, particularly when it comes\nto matters that aren\u2019t readily susceptible to empirical\ninvestigation, including religious matters. (Baker-Hytch 2016: 376)\n\n\nMutual epistemic dependence, so understood, says Baker-Hytch, is a\nconsequence of, among other things, \u201ctwo types of cognitive bias\nthat play a significant role in determining how plausible we will tend\nto find a given item of testimony\u201d: context biases,\nsuch as conformity, prestige, and similarity biases, which together\nmake it much more likely that we accept the testimony of those we\npersonally trust and respect in our communities, and content\nbiases, stemming from the dominance of intuitive processing over\nreflective processing and the attractiveness of \u201cminimally\ncounterintuitive\u201d ideas, especially religious ones, which are\nmore likely to spread via testimony (Barrett 2011: 52\u201372;\nKahneman 2013; Boyer 2001: 87\u2013100). Thus, given mutual epistemic\ndependence, we would expect to see considerable divergence in the\ncontent of religious beliefs and clustering of those beliefs along\ngeographic and cultural lines. So, (i) seems supported.\n\nIn defense of (ii), Baker-Hytch argues that mutual epistemic\ndependence provides a balance between competing goods such as (a)\nexercising interpersonal trust and being invulnerable to deception,\n(b) sharing responsibility for one another\u2019s acquisition of\nepistemic goods and practicing epistemic self-reliance, and (c) having\nopportunities to acquire, practice, and perfect the intellectual\nvirtues and freedom from intellectual obstacles and challenges. Since\nmutual epistemic dependence provides a balance between goods such as\nthese, he claims it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if God were to bring\nit about; indeed, mutual epistemic dependence seems roughly as likely\non inclusive theism as it is on naturalism.\n\nAnother important social consideration for hiddenness arguments in\ngeneral has to do with \u201cdefeated evidence\u201d (cf. Anderson\n2017). Suppose that God provides sufficient evidence for one to\nbelieve that God exists but because we are a social species, another\nperson says or does something that causes one to think differently\nabout one\u2019s evidence. Suppose, for instance, that one is\nprovided with a misleading rebutting or undercutting defeater for\nevidence that would otherwise be sufficient to believe that God\nexists. One\u2019s evidence could be defeated by encountering\napparent peers with very different experiences and perspectives on the\nworld, and there is a significant overlap between divine hiddenness\nand the epistemology of disagreement (cf Matheson 2018). It is also\npossible, however, for one\u2019s evidence to be defeated by the\napparent consensus of those one interacts with. All other things being\nequal, it is usually not rational to believe differently than a\nmajority and especially a super-majority (cf. List 2014). It is at\nleast a question worth asking whether we should expect God not just to\nprovide evidence of God\u2019s existence but to defeat each defeater\nwe acquire through interacting with one another. If it is possible for\nGod to have a reason to allow us to be exposed to unchecked defeaters,\nit may be that there are broader social networks in which defeaters\naggregate or are easier to acquire and that God may have reason not to\nforbid them. \n6. The argument from natural nonbelief\n\nMarsh (2013) focuses on natural nonbelief in God\u2019s existence,\n\n\n\u201cnatural\u201d in the sense of being built into the physical or\nbiological structure of the world, and being generally outside the\nscope of human agency and control. (2013: 355)\n\n\nThe cognitive science of religion, combined with ethnographic data for\npre-industrial cultures (Barrett 2007; Bloom 2009; Stark 2007), show\nthat\n\nearly humans, including many anatomically and behaviorally modern\nhumans, originally lacked a concept of God and were religiously\nrestricted to concepts of limited, and sometimes mean, supernatural\nagents. As a result, many [such humans] failed to believe in God or\nanything like God. The nonbelief in question was both naturally\noccurring and nonresistant. (Marsh 2013: 359)\n\n\nThe \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of instances of natural,\nnonresistant nonbelief in early humans is much more surprising on\ntheism than on naturalism, since it is very surprising that \u201cthe\nhuman mind would be naturally so insensitive to the truth about\nreligion\u201d \u201cgiven that a perfect God would desire to enter\ninto a divine-human relationship with early humans\u201d, whereas\n\u201c[g]iven naturalism\u2019s commitment to indifference about\nwhether early humans would be theists\u201d, it\u2019s much less\nsurprising.\n\nMatters get only worse when one adds that (i) Darwinian\nevolution\u2014\u201cthe claim that natural selection, working on\nrandom mutation, is the driving force behind much, if not most,\nevolutionary change\u201d (351)\u2014helps to explain natural\nnonbelief in early humans and (ii) Darwinian evolution is much more\nlikely on naturalism than theism. As for (i),\n\nthere are three basic ways of thinking about religion and natural\nselection. Religion might be an evolutionary byproduct stemming from\nmental architecture and capacities that evolved for nonreligious\npurposes (Barrett 2004); or religion might be adaptive, and so\nselected for directly (Norenzayan and Shariff 2007); or religion might\nstart out as a byproduct of evolved capacities and later be co-opted\nfor adaptive purposes (Powell and Clarke 2012). No matter which option\none favors, the point is that serious religious diversity and early\nnonbelief in a theistic or theistic-like God is to be expected. (Marsh\n2013: 361)\n\n\nAs for (ii), \u201cDarwinism starts out more likely on naturalism\nthan on theism\u201d because \u201cDarwinism is highly optional on\ntheism\u201d, as evidenced by the fact that \u201can omnipotent God\nwould have many non-Darwinian ways to create minds, bodies, and souls\nand would not be limited to Darwinian or even physical\nconstraints\u201d, whereas on naturalism, \u201cthe options for\ndeveloping life are much more constrained, especially in the relevant\ntime frame\u201d (360\u201361).\n\nSo it is, says Marsh, that natural, nonresistant nonbelief in early\nhumans constitutes evidence for naturalism over theism and, when\ncombined with Darwinian evolution, that evidential force increases\nsubstantially.\n\nEvaluating the argument from natural nonbelief interacts with the\ncognitive science of religion and the question of what the\ndemographics of belief, nonbelief, and the capacity for belief\nactually are. \n\nSome have taken the cognitive science of religion to have provided\nempirical support for the universality of, if not theism, then at\nleast religious impulses friendly to theism (cf. Barrett 2004; Clark\nand Barrett 2011). One might think the surprisingness of discovering\ntheistically friendly religious impulses outweighs the contingent\nrelationship of evolution and theism to which Marsh points since our\nexpectations are not what is probabilistically relevant, but rather\nthe comparative likelihoods of the rival hypotheses conditioned on the\nevidence (Anderson 2021). \n\nOthers have taken the cognitive science of religion to have debunked\nor \u201cexplained away\u201d religious belief. For example, it is\nless clear in the case of religion than in other areas what the\n\u201cMilvian Bridge\u201d is that connects fitness to truth\n(Wilkins & Griffiths 2012). An evolutionary byproduct is, by\ndefinition, selected for reasons independent of its function, and\nadaptionist accounts of religion do not typically reference truth as\nthe value in virtue of which religion may be adaptive. To whatever\nextent that it is plausible that evolutionary explanations such as\nthose from the cognitive science of religion successfully undercut\nreligious belief, this only adds greater force to Marsh\u2019s\nargument as one should find it surprising indeed that God would choose\nto use an epistemic method susceptible to debunking. \n\nIt is possible to have a more mixed perspective on the evidence from\nthe cognitive science of religion. For instance, one might argue that\nthe cognitive science of religion provides the atheist\n\u201cintellectual aid and comfort\u201d, even though it does little\nto decide the God debate in favor of the atheist, and yet provides the\ntheist, at best, with a reason to endorse certain theses in reformed\nepistemology (Penner 2018).\n\nFew philosophers, however, have been willing to take a firm stance on\nthe capacities, beliefs, and practices of hominids that predate our\nown species or even pre-Holocene homo sapiens which leaves a\nfair bit of putative natural nonbelief unaccounted for. However, one\nmight argue that \u201cthe earthly careers of early humans form a\nsubplot in a much larger human story that constitutes a life of\nchoiceworthy meaning for them whether they had the conceptual\nresources to grasp that reality or not\u201d (Vandergriff 2016, 36).\nWhether or not one finds such a line persuasive may hinge on key\nconsiderations from the discussion of Schellenberg\u2019s argument,\nnamely, whether or not one thinks God could create such choiceworthy\nlives without this subplot, and whether the kind of meaningful\nrelationship one should expect God to be invested in could possibly\nlack \u201cthe conceptual resources to grasp that reality.\u201d\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": [" Aijaz, I. and M.
