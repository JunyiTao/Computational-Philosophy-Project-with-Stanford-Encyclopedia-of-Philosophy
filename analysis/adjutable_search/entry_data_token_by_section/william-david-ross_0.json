    "main_text": "Ross\u2019s Life\n1. Ross\u2019s Life\n\nWilliam David Ross was born on 15 April 1877 in Thurso, Scotland. He\nspent the bulk of the first six years of his life in Travancore,\nIndia, where his father, John Ross, was the Principal of the\nMaharaja\u2019s College. He received his formal education in\nScotland, where he attended the Royal High School in Edinburgh and\nEdinburgh University. In 1895, Ross graduated from the latter with\nfirst-class honours in classics. He then entered Balliol College,\nOxford, where he obtained first-class honours in classical honour\nmoderations in 1898 and in literae humaniores in 1900. He was\nthen appointed lecturer at Oriel College, Oxford and at the same time\nhe was elected to a fellowship by examination at Merton College. In\n1902, he dropped the latter when he was elected tutor in philosophy\nand fellow at Oriel College, a position which he held until 1929.\n\nIn 1915, Ross joined the army. When World War I ended he was Deputy\nAssistant Secretary in the Ministry of Munitions, with the rank of\nMajor. He left the army with an OBE. Following the war, he remained\nfor some time in public service on a part-time basis; for his efforts\nhe was made a KBE in 1938. From 1923 to 1928 he was the Deputy\nWhite\u2019s Professor of Moral Philosophy while John Alexander\nStewart was ill. When the position became vacant in 1927, Ross refused\nto stand because (among other reasons) he thought his colleague H. A.\nPrichard a better moral philosopher (and better \u2018philosopher\ngenerally\u2019) and he preferred \u2018working on metaphysics,\nancient and the most modern\u2019 (Clark 1971, 534). Two years later,\nin 1929, he became Provost of Oriel College, a position he held until\nhe retired in 1947. In 1927, he was elected Fellow of the British\nAcademy, and he served as its president from 1936 to 1940. During this\ntime, he played a role in helping foreign scholars fleeing central\nEurope. In World War II he played an essential role in public service,\nserving on an Appeal Tribunal for Conscientious Objectors from 1940 to\n1941 and on the National Arbitration Tribunal from 1941 to 1952. He\nserved as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford from 1941 to 1944. Following the\nwar, in 1947, he became President of the Union Acad\u00e9mique\nInternationale, and, until 1949, the Chairman of the Royal Commission\non the Press. In his retirement Ross continued his work in philosophy.\nHe died in Oxford on 5 May 1971.\n\nRoss\u2019s contributions to university administration and to public\nservice were of no small importance. But it is for his work in\nphilosophy that he is best known. He made contributions to ancient\nphilosophy and to moral philosophy. In his lifetime, Ross was\nconsidered a major figure in the study of Aristotle (Wiggins 2004). He\nwas the General Editor of the Oxford Aristotle translation series,\nfirst with J. A. Smith and then alone; to this series he contributed\ntranslations of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and his\nNicomachean Ethics. Ross edited a number of Aristotle\u2019s\nworks in Greek for the Oxford Classical Texts series, including\nRhetoric, Physics, De Anima, and\nPolitics, and he produced editions of the\nMetaphysics, Physics, Parva Naturalia,\nAnalytics and De Anima with long introductions and\ndetailed commentaries. In addition, he produced two monographs,\nAristotle and Plato\u2019s Theory of Ideas. In\nmoral philosophy, Ross\u2019s most important contributions are\nexpressed in his books The Right and the Good and\nFoundations of Ethics. To these he added a handful of journal\narticles, a critical commentary on Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nGroundwork, Kant\u2019s Ethical Theory, and a\nchapter on Aristotle\u2019s ethics in Aristotle.\n\nIn the introduction to the sixth edition of Ross\u2019s\nAristotle, J. L. Ackrill remarks Ross \u2018made his mark in\npublic life and as a university teacher and administrator, and he\nwrote influential books on ethics. But it is as the leading\nAristotelian of the first half of the century that he will be most\nremembered\u2019 (AT ix). There is certainly no denying Ross was one\nof the most influential Aristotelians of the twentieth century.\nAlthough some of Ross\u2019s translations of Aristotle now have\nformidable competitors, they are still held in high regard. His\neditions of Aristotle\u2019s texts with commentaries continue to be\nan important source for scholars working in ancient philosophy. This\nshould not, however, lead to overlooking Ross\u2019s impact on moral\nphilosophy. Although Ross received rather short shrift from moral\nphilosophers in the last century (e.g., Raphael 1981; Rawls 1971;\nWarnock 1960 ), his ethical outlook is now considered a serious\ncontender and in recent years many of Ross\u2019s moral and\nmeta-ethical doctrines have received sustained attention and (in some\ncases) defence (see, e.g., Audi 1996, 2004; Dancy 2004; Gaut 2002;\nHurka 2004, 2014; McNaughton 1988, 1996; Parfit 2011; Phillips 2019;\nShaver 2007, 2014; Stratton-Lake 2002a, 2002b, 2011a, 2011b). It is\nreasonable, then, to say Ross will be remembered for his work in\nancient philosophy and his work in moral philosophy.\n",
