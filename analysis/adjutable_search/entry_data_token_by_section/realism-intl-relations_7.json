    "main_text": "Neorealism || Kenneth Waltz\u2019s International System\n3.1 Kenneth Waltz\u2019s International System\n\nThe realist retort came most prominently from Kenneth N. Waltz, who\nreformulated realism in international relations in a new and\ndistinctive way. In his book Theory of International\nPolitics, first published in 1979, he responded to the liberal\nchallenge and attempted to cure the defects of the classical realism\nof Hans Morgenthau with his more scientific approach, which has become\nknown as structural realism or neorealism. Whereas Morgenthau rooted\nhis theory in the struggle for power, which he related to human\nnature, Waltz made an effort to avoid any philosophical discussion of\nhuman nature, and set out instead to build a theory of international\npolitics using microeconomics as a model. In his works, he argues that\nstates in the international system are like firms in a domestic\neconomy and have the same fundamental interest: to survive.\n\u201cInternationally, the environment of states\u2019 actions, or\nthe structure of their system, is set by the fact that some states\nprefer survival over other ends obtainable in the short run and act\nwith relative efficiency to achieve that end\u201d (93).\n\nWaltz maintains that by paying attention to the individual state, and\nto ideological, moral and economic issues, both traditional liberals\nand classical realists make the same mistake. They fail to develop a\nserious account of the international system\u2014one that can be\nabstracted from the wider socio-political domain. Waltz acknowledges\nthat such an abstraction distorts reality and omits many of the\nfactors that were important for classical realism. It does not allow\nfor the analysis of the development of specific foreign policies.\nHowever, it also has utility. Notably, it assists in understanding the\nprimary determinants of international politics. To be sure,\nWaltz\u2019s neorealist theory cannot be applied to domestic\npolitics. It cannot serve to develop policies of states concerning\ntheir international or domestic affairs. His theory helps only to\nexplain why states behave in similar ways despite their different\nforms of government and diverse political ideologies, and why, despite\ntheir growing interdependence, the overall picture of international\nrelations is unlikely to change.\n\nAccording to Waltz, the uniform behavior of states over centuries can\nbe explained by the constraints on their behavior that are imposed by\nthe structure of the international system. A system\u2019s structure\nis defined first by the principle by which it is organized, then by\nthe differentiation of its units, and finally by the distribution of\ncapabilities (power) across units. Anarchy, or the absence of central\nauthority, is for Waltz the ordering principle of the international\nsystem. The units of the international system are states. Waltz\nrecognizes the existence of non-state actors, but dismisses them as\nrelatively unimportant. Since all states want to survive, and anarchy\npresupposes a self-help system in which each state has to take care of\nitself, there is no division of labor or functional differentiation\namong them. While functionally similar, they are nonetheless\ndistinguished by their relative capabilities (the power each of them\nrepresents) to perform the same function.\n\nConsequently, Waltz sees power and state behavior in a different way\nfrom the classical realists. For Morgenthau power was both a means and\nan end, and rational state behavior was understood as simply the\ncourse of action that would accumulate the most power. In contrast,\nneorealists assume that the fundamental interest of each state is\nsecurity and would therefore concentrate on the distribution of power.\nWhat also sets neorealism apart from classical realism is\nmethodological rigor and scientific self-conception (Guzinni 1998,\n127\u2013128). Waltz insists on empirical testability of knowledge\nand on falsificationism as a methodological ideal, which, as he\nhimself admits, can have only a limited application in international\nrelations. \n\nThe distribution of capabilities among states can vary; however,\nanarchy, the ordering principle of international relations, remains\nunchanged. This has a lasting effect on the behavior of states that\nbecome socialized into the logic of self-help. Trying to refute\nneoliberal ideas concerning the effects of interdependence, Waltz\nidentifies two reasons why the anarchic international system limits\ncooperation: insecurity and unequal gains. In the context of anarchy,\neach state is uncertain about the intentions of others and is afraid\nthat the possible gains resulting from cooperation may favor other\nstates more than itself, and thus lead it to dependence on others.\n\u201cStates do not willingly place themselves in situations of\nincreased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of\nsecurity subordinate economic gain to political interest.\u201d\n(Waltz 1979, 107).\n\nBecause of its theoretical elegance and methodological rigor,\nneorealism has become very influential within the discipline of\ninternational relations. In the eyes of many scholars,\nMorgenthau\u2019s realism has come to be seen as\nanachronistic\u2014\u201can interesting and important episode in the\nhistory of thinking about the subject, no doubt, but one scarcely to\nbe seen as a serious contribution of the rigorously scientific\ntheory\u201d (Williams 2007, 1). However, while initially gaining\nmore acceptance than classical realism, neorealism has also provoked\nstrong critiques on a number of fronts.\n",
