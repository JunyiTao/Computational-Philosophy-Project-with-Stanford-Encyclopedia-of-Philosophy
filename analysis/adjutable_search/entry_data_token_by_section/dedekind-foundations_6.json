    "main_text": "Other Mathematical Contributions || Function Fields, Groups, Lattices\n4.2 Function Fields, Groups, Lattices\n\nFor our purposes, three additional areas in which Dedekind applied his\nset-theoretic, infinitary, and structuralist approach are relevant:\nthe theory of algebraic functions, group theory, and lattice\ntheory.\n\nDedekind realized early on that several of the notions and techniques\nhe had introduced in algebraic number theory could be transferred to\nthe study of algebraic functions (algebraic function fields, in later\nterminology), especially the set-theoretic introduction of ideals and\nways of calculating with them (cf. Haffner 2014, 2015, 2017 for\nemphasizing the latter). This realization came to fruition in\n\u201cTheorie der algebraischen Funktionen einer\nVer\u00e4nderlichen\u201d, \na substantive article co-written with\nHeinrich Weber and published in 1882. The approach in it led, among\nothers, to a better understanding of Riemann surfaces, including a\npurely algebraic proof of the celebrated Riemann-Roch Theorem (Geyer\n1981, Kolmogorov & Yushkevich 2001, ch. 2, Stillwell 2012). As\nthese were issues of wide interest among mathematicians, the success\ngave Dedekind\u2019s approach significant legitimacy and publicity (cf.\nEdwards 1983, Dieudonn\u00e9 1985).\n\nSecond, Dedekind\u2019s contributions to algebraic number theory were\nconnected, in a natural and fruitful way, with Evariste Galois\u2019\nrevolutionary group-theoretic approach to algebra. In fact, Dedekind\u2019s\nearly and systematic study of Galois theory\u2014he was \nthe first to lecture on it at a German university, already during his time as a\nPrivatdozent in G\u00f6ttingen\u2014led \nto a transformation\nof that theory itself. It turned from the study of substitutions in\nformulas and of functions invariant under such substitutions into the\nstudy of field extensions and corresponding automorphisms, which deep\nconnections to algebraic number theory (Mehrtens 1979b, Stein 1988,\nFerreir\u00f3s & Reck 2020). \nDedekind also introduced additional\napplications of Galois theory, e.g., in the study of modular equations\nand functions (Gray 2000, ch. 4, Alten et al. 2003, ch. 8).\n\nAs a third spin-off, Dedekind\u2019s number-theoretic investigations led to\nthe introduction of the notion of a \u201clattice\u201d (under the\nname \u201cDualgruppe\u201d). He examined that notion\nfurther, also as a topic in itself, in two relatively late articles:\n\u201c\u00dcber Zerlegungen von Zahlen durch ihre gr\u00f6\u00dften\ngemeinsamen Teiler\u201d (1897) and \u201c\u00dcber die von drei\nModuln erzeugte Dualgruppe\u201d (1900). While these articles did not\nhave the same immediate and strong impact that several of his other\npublications had, they were later recognized as original, systematic\ncontributions to lattice theory, especially to the study of modular\nlattices (Mehrtens 1979a, ch. 2, Burris 1983, Alten et al. 2003, ch.\n10) and to an axiomatic approach to mathematics more generally\n(Schlimm 2000, 2011, 2017).\n\nNone of these contributions by Dedekind can be treated in any detail\nhere (and various others have to be ignored completely), but some\ngeneral observations about them can be made. While they again\nexemplify a set-theoretic and infinitary perspective, they also\ndisplay the following related features: the focus on entire systems of\nobjects and on general laws for them; the move away from particular\nformulas, or from particular symbolic representations, to more general\ncharacterizations of the underlying systems of objects, specifically\nin terms of relational and functional properties; the consideration of\nhomomorphisms, automorphisms, isomorphisms, and features invariant\nunder such mappings; and the investigation of novel, abstract\nconcepts, introduced in connection with specific cases but then\nstudied in themselves.\n\nThese features are, in fact, characteristic for Dedekind\u2019s works\noverall, including his studies in algebraic number theory and his\nfoundational investigations. It is by taking them into account that\ncalling his methodology, not just \u201cgeneral\u201d \nand \u201cabstract\u201d, but \u201cstructuralist\u201d starts to\nacquire further content. It also helps us to recognized in which way\nDedekind\u2019s approach played a crucial role in the emergence of\n\u201cmodern\u201d mathematics, as shaped by a structuralist\nmethodology (cf. Reck & Schiemer 2020). Looking back on the\ncorresponding history of algebra, B.L. van der Waerden, himself a\nmajor contributor to this field, concluded: \u201cIt was Evariste\nGalois and Richard Dedekind who gave modern algebra its structure;\nthat is where its weight-bearing skeleton comes from\u201d (Dedekind\n1964, foreword, quoted in Mehrtens 1979b; cf. also Gray 2008).\n",
