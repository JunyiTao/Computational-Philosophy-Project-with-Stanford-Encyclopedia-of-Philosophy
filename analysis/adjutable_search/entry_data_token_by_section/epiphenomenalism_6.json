(To illustrate with\nPutnam\u2019s (1975) famous example from Twin Earth, what a thought\nthat \\(S\\) might express by \u201cThis is water\u201d is actually\nabout depends on what the transparent, tasteless liquid in\n\\(S\\)\u2019s environment actually is.) It seems, however, that the\ncausal determinants of \\(S\\)\u2019s behavior can depend only on\nevents occurring inside \\(S\\)\u2019s body. Thus, if externalism is\nright, what \\(S\\) does cannot depend on the intentional content of\n\\(S\\)\u2019s thoughts.\n\nThis conclusion is compatible with holding that a proper\ndescription of \\(S\\)\u2019s behavior should refer to\ncircumstances external to \\(S\\). For example, describing \\(S\\) as\nreaching for a glass of water may not be appropriate unless\n\\(S\\) believes the glass contains water; and that this is what \\(S\\)\nbelieves may depend on circumstances external to \\(S\\). But then, it\nis at least tempting to conclude that it cannot be the intentional\ncharacter of \\(S\\)\u2019s belief that is causing the extension of\n\\(S\\)\u2019s arm toward the glass. After all, \\(S\\)\u2019s\ntwin-earth double has, in some sense, a different belief (one that\nrefers to XYZ) but the internal bodily story of the causation of the\ndouble\u2019s arm-extension will be exactly the same as the story for\n\\(S\\) (up to substitution of XYZ in the double\u2019s body wherever\n\\(S\\) has an H2O molecule).\n\n(2) Donald Davidson\u2019s (1970) anomalous monism held that (i) each\nmental event is identical with a physical event, but (ii) there are no\npsychophysical laws. Davidson accepted the view that causation\ninvolves laws and, in view of (ii), held that the laws into which\nmental events entered related physical properties (or, mental events\nunder their physical descriptions). Many philosophers regarded this\nview as tantamount to epiphenomenalism, i.e., to the view that\ncausation of our behavior involves only the physical properties of our\nparts, and that the mental properties as such have no efficacy.\n\n(3) A similar discussion rages today, but begins with a background\nassumption of multiple realization. It is thought to be highly\nimplausible that belief in a particular proposition, or desire for a\nparticular state of affairs, is identical with the same state of a\nbrain (or a part of a brain) in different people, or even in the same\nperson at different times. Instead, the same belief or desire is taken\nto be \u201crealized\u201d by different neural structures or states\nof activation on different occasions.\n\nSince the physical properties of different neural events are\ndifferent, transitivity of identity prohibits claiming identity of\nmental properties with any of the physical properties whose\ninstantiation realizes those mental properties. In a body of work\nstretching over many years, Jaegwon Kim (e.g., 1993, 2005) has argued\nthat this division of mental from physical properties leads to\nexclusion of mental properties from playing a causal role. After all,\nit is widely accepted that the physical properties of neural events,\ntogether with a person\u2019s state of neural connectivity, are\nsufficient to produce later neural events. Since behavior depends on\nmuscle contractions that depend on neural innervation, it seems that\nphysical events and structures, and the physical laws that apply to\nthem, are quite enough to bring about our behavior. There is nothing\nleft for mental properties to do.\n\nThere are, of course, some cases in which there is more than one\nsufficient cause of an event. Caesar\u2019s death seems likely to\nhave been overdetermined, i.e., it is probable that more than one\nattacker\u2019s stroke would have been sufficient by itself for his\ndeath. But instances of mental properties are not distinct from\ninstances of physical properties that are their realizers in the way\nthat stabbings are distinct from each other, and systematic\noverdetermination of our behavior is generally regarded as\nimplausible.\n",
