    "main_text": "Self-knowledge and Metacognition || Inferentialist Approaches\n5.2 Inferentialist Approaches\n\nSeveral theorists, who we will term \u201cinferentialists\u201d,\nfollow Ryle (1949 [2009]) in his claim that we often come to know what\nwe are thinking by \u201coverhear[ing]\u201d, or\n\u201ceavesdrop[ping] on \u2026 our own silent monologues\u201d\n(1949 [2009: 165]). On these views, we come to know what we are\nthinking, or what we believe or desire, by drawing a kind of inference\n(the nature of which differs, depending on the theorist) from the fact\nthat we \u201chear\u201d ourselves say something in inner speech.\nThe views of Clark, Berm\u00fadez, Jackendoff, and Prinz, already\nreviewed, are inferentialist in nature. Yet there are other approaches\nthat incorporate inner speech into a process that is even more\nexplicitly inferential.\n\nCarruthers (2009, 2010, 2011, 2018) is an inferentialist of this\nlatter sort. While, in earlier work, he argued that thought itself\noccurs in inner speech (Carruthers 2002), Carruthers later abandoned\nthat idea to hold that thoughts (including one\u2019s beliefs) are\nalways unconscious. On this view, inner speech episodes remain more or\nless directly available to introspection, yet only provide a kind of\nindirect evidence for what we are in fact judging or deciding (or\nbelieving, desiring, or intending) unconsciously. He emphasizes the\nfallible nature of such inferences, arguing on the basis of various\nempirical studies that many of the inferences people arrive at about\ntheir own beliefs and desires are in fact incorrect. Similarly to\nJackendoff and Prinz, Carruthers holds that only sensory states are\nable to serve as inputs to the mental mechanism responsible for self-\n(and other-) directed mindreading. These inputs include visual and\nother forms of sensory imagery in addition to inner speech. However,\nin cases where we are having thoughts about abstract matters that are\ndifficult to unambiguously represent with other forms of\nimagery\u2014such as the thought that philosophy is a challenging\nsubject\u2014episodes of inner speech are held to provide an\nespecially important source of information that one is having such\nthoughts. Carruthers emphasizes that the process becomes especially\ninferential in nature where other contextual information\u2014such as\nthat one sees oneself lingering over a choice of cereal\nbox\u2014combines with one\u2019s inner speech to generate an\nall-things-considered appraisal of what one is currently judging or\ndeciding. Cassam (2011, 2014) likewise implicates inner speech in a\nmulti-faceted inferentialist account of self-knowledge, though not\npitched in terms of \u201cmindreading\u201d mechanisms or other\nconstructs from cognitive science.\n\nAlex Byrne (2011, 2018) puts inner speech to somewhat different ends\nin his inferentialist account of how we know what we are thinking. For\nByrne, there is no such thing as inner speech, strictly speaking,\nbecause there are no sounds (or voices) in the head. However, there\nare such things as auditory-phonological representations of voices.\nThese give rise to an apparent perception of what we come to think of\nas the \u201cinner voice\u201d. By trying to attend to what the\ninner voice says, Byrne proposes, we can reliably form judgments about\nwhat we are thinking. The epistemic rule he proposes for doing so\nis:\n\n\nTHINK: If the inner voice speaks about x, believe that you\nare thinking about x.\n\n\nAs with Carruthers, a key motivation for Byrne\u2019s account of how\nwe know what we are thinking is a background view\u2014motivated by\nthe work of Shoemaker (1994), Dretske (2003), and others\u2014that we\nhave no other, more direct introspective method for knowing our own\nthoughts (i.e., we lack something like an \u201cinner sense\u201d).\nNote that Byrne\u2019s approach is inferentialist in that he takes\ninner speech to be implicated in inferences that lead to knowledge of\none\u2019s own occurrent thoughts. Yet the sort of inference involved\nis quite different from that envisioned by Carruthers and Cassam, who\nboth hold that inner speech episodes are just one kind of information\namong many that may be brought to bear in inferences about one\u2019s\nstanding and occurrent mental states. Importantly, the form of\ninference envisioned by Carruthers and Cassam is essentially the same\nin its first and third person applications, whereas Byrne\u2019s\nTHINK rule is of an inferential procedure that can only be used to\nreliably generate true beliefs about one\u2019s own mental states. In\nByrne\u2019s view, this helps to explain the \u201cpeculiar\u201d\nnature of introspection, where this peculiarity lies in the fact that\nour methods for knowing our own mental states are (intuitively)\ndifferent from those we use to know others\u2019 (Byrne 2011, 2018).\nFurther, on Byrne\u2019s version of inferentialism, the inferences we\nform by trying to follow THINK are extremely likely to amount to\nknowledge\u2014thereby cohering with the intuition that knowledge of\none\u2019s own current thoughts is epistemically privileged. Whereas,\nthe kinds of metacognitive inferences that Carruthers and Cassam\nenvision to rely on inner speech are (by their own telling)\nepistemically on a par with our inferences about the mental states of\nothers and far more susceptible to error.\n",
