    "main_text": "Two Types of Simulation Processes\n3. Two Types of Simulation Processes\n\nNow that we have definitions of \u201cmental simulation of\u201d and\ncognate notions, it is time to consider which mental states and\nprocesses satisfy them, if any. Are there really simulated mental\nstates? That is, are there mental states generated by the\nreuse of cognitive mechanisms? And do these mental states\nresemble the mental states generated by the use of such\nmechanisms? For example, is it truly the case that visual images are\nmental simulations of visual experiences? What about\ndecisions, emotions, beliefs, desires, and bodily sensations? Can our\nminds generate simulated counterparts of all these types of mental\nstates? In this section, we consider how Simulation Theorists have\ntackled these problems. We will do so by focusing on the following\nquestion: are there really simulation processes (as defined\nby\n PROC)?\n If the answer to this question is positive, it follows that there are\nmental states standing in the relation of mental simulation (as\ndefined by\n RES+REU),\n and thus simulated mental states.\n\nFollowing Goldman (2006), it has become customary among Simulation\nTheorists to argue for the existence of two types of simulation\nprocesses: high-level simulation processes and\nlow-level simulation processes (see, however, de Vignemont\n2009). By exploring this distinction, we begin to articulate the\ncognitive architecture underlying mental simulation proposed by\nST.\n",
