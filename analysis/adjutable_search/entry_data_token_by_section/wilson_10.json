    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n11. Legacy\n\nThe historical importance of Cook Wilson\u2019s influence ought not\nto be underestimated. In his obituary, H. W. B. Joseph described him\nas being \u201cby far the most influential philosophical teacher in\nOxford\u201d, adding that no one had held a place so important since\nT. H. Green (Joseph 1916b, 555). This should be compared with the\nclaim that in the 1950s Wittgenstein was \u201cthe most powerful and\npervasive influence\u201d (Warnock 1958, 62). The\n\u2018realist\u2019 reaction against British Idealism at the turn of\nthe 20th century was at any rate not confined to the\nwell-known rebellion of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell at Cambridge.\nThere were also \u2018realisms\u2019 sprouting in Manchester (with\nRobert Adamson and Samuel Alexander), and in Oxford too, where Thomas\nCase had already argued for realism in Physical Realism (Case\n1888) (Marion 2002b), although it is clearly Cook Wilson\u2019s\ninfluence that swayed Oxford away from idealism. Since he published so\nlittle, it is therefore mainly through teaching and personal contact\nthat he made a significant impact on Oxford philosophy, not only\nthrough the peculiar tutorial style to which generations of\n\u2018Greats\u2019 students were subjected\u2014as described in\nWalsh (2000) or Ackrill (1997, 2\u20135)\u2014but also through\nmeetings that he initiated, which were to become the\n\u2018Philosophers\u2019 Teas\u2019 under Prichard\u2019s\ntutelage, the \u2018Wee Teas\u2019 under Ryle\u2019s and\n\u2018Saturday Mornings\u2019 under Austin\u2019s.\n\nHis legacy can thus be plotted through successive generations of\nOxford philosophers. E. F. Carritt, R. G. Collingwood (who reverted to\na form of idealism later on), G. Dawes Hicks, H. W. B. Joseph, H. A.\nPrichard, W. D. Ross and C. C. J. Webb are among his better-known\npupils at the turn of the century. After his death, his influence\nextended through the teaching of Carritt, Joseph and Prichard, and the\nposthumous volumes of Statement and Inference to the\npost-World War I generation of the 1920s, including Frank Hardie, W.\nC. Kneale, J. D. Mabbott, H. H. Price, R. Robinson and G. Ryle, and\nthe early analytic philosophers of the 1930s, J. L. Austin, I. Berlin,\nJ. O. Urmson, and H. L. A. Hart, in particular. For example, Isaiah\nBerlin\u2019s described Hart as \u201can excellent solid Cook\nWilsonian\u201d in a letter to Price (Berlin 2004, 509), and admitted\nhimself to have been at first an Oxford Realist (Jahanbegloo 1992,\n153). (See Marion (2000, 490\u2013508) for further details.) Thus,\nOxford Realism first dislodged British Idealism from its position of\nprominence at Oxford and then transformed itself into ordinary\nlanguage philosophy and, as pointed out in the previous section, moral\nintuitionism. In the post-World War II years, Cook Wilson\u2019s name\ngradually faded away, however, while \u2018ordinary language\nphilosophy\u2019, which owed a lot to his constant reliance on\nordinary language against philosophical jargon, blossomed. It became\none of the strands that go under the name of \u2018analytic\nphilosophy\u2019, so Cook Wilson should perhaps be seen as one of its\nmany ancestors.\n\nThe only Oxford philosopher of note who opposed the\n\u2018realists\u2019 before World War II was R. G. Collingwood, who\ndied too soon in 1943. He felt increasingly alienated and ended up\nreduced to invective, describing their theory of knowledge as\n\u201cbased upon the grandest foundation a philosophy can have,\nnamely human stupidity\u201d (Collingwood 1998, 34) and their\nattitude towards moral philosophy as a \u201cmental kind of\ndecaudation\u201d (Collingwood 2013, 50). Collingwood objected to\nCook Wilson\u2019s anti-idealist claim that \u2018knowing makes no\ndifference to the object known\u2019, that in order to vindicate it\none would need to compare the object as it is being known with the\nobject independently of its being known, which is the same as knowing\nsomething unknown, a contradiction (Collingwood 2013, 44). But\nCollingwood\u2019s argument did not rule out the possibility of\ncoming to know an object, while knowing that it was not altered in the\nprocess. (For critical appraisals, see Donagan (1985, 285\u2013289)\nJacquette (2006) and Beaney (2013).) In another telling complaint, he\ncriticized the Oxford Realists for being interested in assessing the\ntruth or falsity of specific philosophical theses without paying\nattention to the fact that the meaning of the concepts involved may\nhave evolved through history, and so there is simply no \u2018eternal\nproblem\u2019 (Collingwood 2013, chap. 7). This points to a lack of\nhistorical sensitivity, which is indeed another feature of analytic\nphilosophy that arguably originates in Cook Wilson.\n\nThere was another deleterious side to Cook Wilson\u2019s influence in\nOxford: his contempt for mathematical logic. It explains why one had\nto wait until the appointment of Hao Wang in the 1950s for modern\nformal logic first to be taught at Oxford. In the 1930s, H. H. Price\nwas still teaching deductive logic from H. W. B. Joseph\u2019s An\nIntroduction to Logic (Joseph 1916a) and inductive logic from J.\nS. Mill\u2019s System of Logic. This reactionary attitude\ntowards modern logic and later objections to \u2018ordinary language\nphilosophy\u2019 go a long way to explain why Cook Wilson\u2019s\nreputation dropped significantly in the second half of last century.\nIn the 1950s, Wilfrid Sellars was virtually alone in his praise:\n\n\nI can say in all seriousness that twenty years ago I regarded\nWilson\u2019s Statement and Inference as the philosophical\nbook of the century, and Prichard\u2019s lectures on perception and\non moral philosophy, which I attended with excitement, as veritable\nmodels of exposition and analysis. I may add that while my\nphilosophical ideas have undergone considerable changes since 1935, I\nstill think that some of the best philosophical thinking of the past\nhundred years was done by these two men. (Sellars 1957, 458).\n\n\nAs the tide of \u2018ordinary language philosophy\u2019 ebbed, Cook\nWilson\u2019s views on knowledge showed more resilience. In the\n1960s, Phillips Griffiths\u2019 anthology on Knowledge and\nBelief included excerpts from Cook Wilson (Phillips Griffiths\n1967, 16\u201327) and John Passmore was able to write that\n\u201cCook Wilson\u2019s logic may have had few imitators; but his\nsoul goes marching on in Oxford theories of knowledge\u201d (Passmore\n1968, 257).\n\nAs shown in sections 5 and 6, Cook Wilson\u2019s views on knowledge\nand perception are now once more involved in contemporary debates.\nThey had remained influential all along, although his name was often\nnot mentioned. His peculiar combination of the claims that knowledge\nis a factive state of mind and that it is undefinable, argued for anew\nby J. L. Austin, has been taken up and further developed by John\nMcDowell (McDowell 1994, 1998), Charles Travis (Travis 1989, 2008),\nand Timothy Williamson (Williamson 2000, 2007), who is currently\nWykeham Professor of Logic, New College. One has, therefore, what\nCharles Travis once described as \u201can Oxford tradition despite\nitself\u201d (Travis (1989, xii), on this last point, see also\nWilliamson (2007, 269\u2013270n)).\n\nDuring the twentieth century, secondary literature on Cook\nWilson\u2019s philosophy was not considerable, with a few papers of\nunequal value by Foster (1931), Furlong (1941), Lloyd Beck (1931) and\nRobinson (1928a, 1928b), along with a few studies on universals in the\npost-war years (see section 7), and only one valuable commentary,\nRichard Robinson\u2019s The Province of Logic (Robinson\n1931). Interest in the study of his philosophy was only revived at the\nbeginning of this century, with Marion (2000) giving a first overview\nof Oxford Realism. In a short book, Kohne (2010) charts the views of\nCook Wilson, Prichard and Austin on knowledge as a mental state. An\nimportant contribution, Kalderon & Travis (2013) secured Oxford\nRealism\u2019s place in the history of analytic philosophy, comparing\nit with other forms of realism in Frege, Russell and Moore, while\ndrawing links with later developments in the writings of J. L. Austin,\nJ. M. Hinton and John McDowell. As a result of this revival of\ninterest, the philosophies of J. L. Austin (Longworth 2018a, 2018b\n& 2019, and the entry to this Encyclopedia) and of Wilfrid Sellars\n(Brandhoff 2020) are now being re-interpreted in light of Cook\nWilson\u2019s legacy.\n",
