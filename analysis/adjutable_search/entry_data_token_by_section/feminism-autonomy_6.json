    "main_text": "Procedural Conceptions\n4. Procedural Conceptions\n\nThis section outlines two versions of procedural and content-neutral\nconceptions that are well-known in the feminist literature: those of\nMarilyn Friedman and Diana Tietjens Meyers.\n\nProcedural conceptions have been prominent in the standard literature\non autonomy from the 1970s to the present day (e.g., Dworkin 1988;\nFrankfurt 1988; Christman 2009). These conceptions have been adopted\nin different forms by feminist theorists. The concept of\ncontent-neutrality has been an extremely important tool in the\nfeminist rehabilitation of autonomy and procedural conceptions are\nattractive to feminists in large part due to their content-neutrality.\nMany feminists hesitate to embrace autonomy because of its\nassociations with \u201cmasculinist\u201d ideals such as those\nexemplified in the \u201cself-made man\u201d, namely, substantive\nindependence and self-reliance, social isolation and hyper-rationality\n(Jaggar 1985; Code 1991). However, on content-neutral conceptions,\nthere is no value or set of preferences that an autonomous person must\nendorse. Preferences for relationships of care and dependency such as\nthose within marriage or other family structures can be just as\nautonomous as preferences for self-reliance or relative social\nisolation; preferences for cultural and religious norms into which\nagents are born can be just as autonomous as preferences to repudiate\nthese norms, and so on. The device of content-neutrality also respects\nfeminist attempts to preserve the differences among and the\nmultiplicity of agents. Feminists noticed that agents\u2019\nlife-plans and conceptions of the good will be influenced by a\ndiversity of social factors such as race, class, and gender (Friedman\n2003; Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b; Meyers 1989, 2002). Hence they\nargue that theories of autonomy must be neutral with respect to\nlife-plans and conceptions of the good. According to some feminists, a\ntheory of autonomy should not \u201chomogenize\u201d agents (Meyers\n2000a, 480), nor should it impose feminist, liberal, or any other\nideals on agents in the name of autonomy. Content-neutrality allows\nthat the preferences of autonomous agents could be wrong from\nanother perspective, either morally or because they do not align with\nthe agent\u2019s best interests. Many theorists consider that a\ncriterion of a correct theory of autonomy is that it distinguish\nbetween self-rule and right-rule (Benson 2005a).\nContent-neutrality ensures that self-rule does not collapse into\nright-rule, and further that agents are protected from the risk of\npaternalistic interference in their decisions.\n\nProcedural conceptions characterize autonomous agents\u2014agents\nwhose preferences and desires are genuinely their\nown\u2014as those who critically reflect in the appropriate\nway to evaluate their preferences, motives, and desires. Such\napproaches are often hierarchical (employing a hierarchy of\nmental states to explain autonomy) as well as structural\n(proposing conditions that an agent\u2019s existing\nmotivational state must satisfy). One well-known example of a\nhierarchical and structural approach is that of Harry Frankfurt. On\nFrankfurt\u2019s account, autonomy requires \u201cwholehearted\nidentification\u201d at a higher-order level with lower-order\nmotives, preferences, or desires (Frankfurt 1988). These structural\nand ahistorical approaches have been subject to many cogent objections\n(Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b; Taylor 2005b). One important\ndifficulty is the \u201cproblem of manipulation\u201d in which it is\nsupposed that a hypnotist inserts into an agent a mental state\nstructure that is sufficient for autonomy (see, e.g., Taylor 2005b).\nOn structural accounts, this agent counts as autonomous when she\nappears not to be.\n\nThe procedural conceptions defended by Friedman and Meyers exemplify\nan alternative approach in which autonomy is not tied to the\nstructural features of an occurrent mental state but rather is\nachieved when the agent undergoes a historical process of\ncritical reflection. John Christman is an important proponent in the\nstandard literature of the historical approach (Christman 1991;\nChristman 2009; see also Mele 1995). For Christman, as for many others\nwho adopt procedural conceptions, autonomous agents must be both\nreflectively competent and authentic. The test for authenticity on his\naccount is historical and counterfactual: an agent is authentic with\nrespect to a certain preference or desire if and only if she did not\nresist the development of the preference or desire when attending to\nthe process of its development, or would not have resisted\nhad she attended to the process (Christman 1990; Christman 1991, 346).\nIn recent work, Christman develops the notion of\nnonalienation as the test of authenticity: an agent is\nauthentic with respect to a desire if and only if, were she to\ncritically reflect on the historical processes leading to the desire,\nshe would not be alienated from the desire, where\n\u201calienation\u201d is understood as either a negative judgment\nabout or a negative emotional reaction to the desire (Christman 2009,\n144, 155\u20136).\n\nFriedman employs the related idea of reflective endorsement:\na process of critical reflection can result in either endorsement and\nwholehearted commitment to one\u2019s preferences and desires, to\nwholehearted repudiation of the preferences or desires, or to\nhalf-hearted commitment to the preferences or desires (Friedman 2003,\n4\u20135). Friedman says that \u201cwhen an agent chooses or acts in\naccord with wants or desires that she has self-reflectively endorsed,\nthen she is autonomous\u201d (Friedman 2003, 5). Agents acting on\ndesires that satisfy this condition are acting authentically and on\ntheir deepest commitments.\n\nOn Friedman\u2019s conception, and on procedural accounts in general,\nthere is no reason in principle why choosing subservience, or adopting\noppressive norms, could not be autonomous. An example considered by\nFriedman is that of a preference to remain in an abusive domestic\nrelationship due to adherence to religious or moral norms of marriage.\nThe preference may be adaptive in the sense described in \u00a72 if\nthe agent has unconsciously adjusted her preferences to accommodate\nthe circumstances, thinking she has no other feasible options.\nFriedman comments that if these religious or moral norms are the ones\nthe agent \u201creally cares about\u201d, her preference to remain\nis autonomous. She writes:\n\nSomeone\u2019s self-reflections and choices under those conditions\nare less likely than otherwise to be reliable reflections of what she\nreally cares about. Yet it is not impossible to discern or act\naccording to one\u2019s deeper concerns under coercive conditions.\n(Friedman 2003, 146)\n\n\nThe agent may even recognize that choosing to remain in an abusive\nrelationship is in effect to choose a situation in which her own\nfuture autonomy may be compromised. But, as Friedman points out,\nautonomy is not the only value, and, the case could be explained as\nthe agent ranking her own future autonomy against other values of\nimportance to her. In the agent\u2019s calculations, future autonomy\nis ranked below other considerations; it is not overriding.\n\nFriedman nevertheless is reluctant to treat such agents as autonomous\nto the highest degree. She proposes a \u201cthreshold\u201d account.\nThat is, when the preference for a traditional role of subservience,\nor to remain in an abusive relationship, reflects the agent\u2019s\ndeepest commitments, it meets a threshold and hence is autonomous.\nHowever, although these agents are locally autonomous relative to\nthese preferences, they are less autonomous than agents who\naltogether repudiate what Friedman calls \u201cautonomy-devaluing\nnorms\u201d (Friedman 2003, 24).\n\nMeyers introduces the notion of \u201cautonomy competency\u201d to\nspell out her procedural conception. In an early paper, Meyers\ndescribes acting autonomously as \u201cthe difference between doing\nwhat one wants and doing what one really wants. The autonomous self is\nnot identical with the apparent self; it is an authentic or\n\u2018true\u2019 self\u201d (Meyers 1987, 619). For Meyers, the\nauthentic self emerges when a person exercises the \u201cagentic\nskills\u201d that characterize autonomous people:\n\nAutonomous people exercise a repertoire of skills to engage in\nself-discovery, self-definition and self-direction, and...the\nauthentic self is the evolving collocation of attributes that emerges\nin this ongoing process of reflection, deliberation and action.\n(Meyers 2005, 49)\n\n\nShe argues that the skills necessary for the authentic self to be\nrealized can be damaged by gender socialization. In the case of\nWestern women, the \u201cemotional receptivity and\nperceptiveness\u201d that is encouraged in women is likely to enhance\nthe skill of self-discovery and hinder those of self-definition and\ndirection; whereas for men in Western cultures the opposite is likely\nto be the case (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b, 18).\n\nMeyers endorses the content-neutrality of the procedural account\nbecause she considers that substantive or\n\u201cvalue-saturated\u201d accounts of autonomy limit the\nlife-plans and conceptions of the good available to autonomous agents,\nand undermine the possibility of diversity. However, in an analysis of\nthe practice of \u201cgenital cutting\u201d, she acknowledges that\n\u201cvalue-neutral\u201d approaches to autonomy, such as her own,\nshould not \u201c[neglect] the possibility that a well-integrated and\nsmoothly functioning self could be in need of rigorous scrutiny and\ndrastic overhaul\u201d (2000a, 480). Meyers argues for the importance\nin such cases of education programs that \u201caugment\nautonomy\u201d because \u201c[s]uccessful education programs\nmobilize women\u2019s introspection, imagination and imagination\nskills\u201d. For example:\n\nOne program invited women to explore their feelings about their\nsexuality\u2026[and encouraged them] to acknowledge the complexity\nof their emotional lives and to take their own subjectivity seriously.\nAnother\u2026invited women to empathize with [women who had become\ninfected] and the grief of the families of women and girls who had\ndied\u2026 [Another invited] women to imagine the lives of women\nwhose cultures are different but whose religion is the same as their\nown. (Meyers 2000a, 485)\n\n\nMeyers\u2019s account implies, then, that certain specific elements\nof the critical reflection required for autonomy\u2014namely,\nintrospection and imagination\u2014can be damaged by oppressive\npractices. Moreover, if agents lack self-respect due to being\nsubjected to oppression, they may not achieve autonomy competency.\nMeyers proposes that self-respect is necessary to achieve the\nself-realization required for autonomy competency, although it\n\u201ccannot be construed as a masculine or perfectionist\nvalue\u201d (Meyers 1989, 208; compare Dillon\u2019s feminist\nconception of self-respect in Dillon 1992). Due to the presence of a\nmoral notion of self-respect in Meyers\u2019s account, it has been\nquestioned whether the account is really value-neutral. In one sense,\nher account is content-neutral: the life-plan that an\nautonomous agent can define for herself is not constrained by moral or\nother requirements; it does not have to be a moral life-plan or one\nthat is otherwise good for the agent to undertake. In another sense,\nbecause of the role of self-nurturing and self-respect without which\nthe exercise of autonomy competency would not be possible,\nMeyers\u2019s account could be said to have \u201cweak normative\nsubstance\u201d and hence be weakly substantive (Benson 2005a).\n\nFriedman\u2019s and Meyers\u2019s conceptions of autonomy illustrate\nfour features of autonomy that have been influential in subsequent\nfeminist work. First, their conceptions of autonomy are (causally)\nrelational. Meyers considers the impact of oppressive\nsocialization on autonomy competency. Friedman considers the\nimpact of familial and community relationships (Friedman\n2003, 97). Restrictive or oppressive social relationships may hamper\nan agent\u2019s ability to develop the capacity for critical\nreflection that is required for autonomy, or they may provide role\nmodels, self-trust, self-confidence, and so forth, which enhance the\ncapacity (Friedman 2003, 97).\n\nSecond, both Friedman and Meyers claim that autonomy is a matter of\ndegree. On Friedman\u2019s conception, autonomy comes in degrees\nbecause an agent\u2019s capacity for critical reflection may operate\nat different levels of sophistication depending on the agent\u2019s\nsocialization and educational background. Meyers distinguishes\nepisodic or local autonomy\u2014the capacity to\ndecide in particular situations\u2014from programmatic\nautonomy, which is the capacity to decide major life issues (e.g.,\nwhether to be a mother, or whether to dedicate oneself to the pursuit\nof a career). Meyers thinks that oppressive socialization hampers\nprogrammatic autonomy but not necessarily local autonomy (Mackenzie\n& Stoljar 2000b, 18). For example, oppressive socialization\n(which, for instance, might value marriage or motherhood over a career\nor financial independence) may truncate the range of options that\ngirls consider to be viable, thus interfering with their programmatic\nautonomy. They may nevertheless have strongly developed critical\nreasoning faculties that allow them a high degree of competency to\nexercise local autonomy skills. If an agent is capable of local\nautonomy but not programmatic autonomy, she has autonomy only to a\ndegree.\n\nThird, Friedman and Meyers reject the association of autonomy with\nhyper-rationality or (overly) cognitive aspects of the self. Friedman\nnotes that the \u201cself-reflections that make choices and actions\nautonomous need not be conscious\u201d and that \u201cautonomous\nchoice\u2026does not need to be highly deliberate or\ndeliberated\u201d (Friedman 2003, 8). Moreover, feelings may\nconstitute \u201creasons\u201d on Friedman\u2019s view:\n\u201cemotions and desires, as well as imagination, can constitute a\nkind of reflection on or attention to objects or values of\nconcern\u201d (Friedman 2003, 10). Meyers also repudiates the\n\u201chyper-rational\u201d construal of the skills that are\nnecessary for autonomy on her theory. In recent work, she has focused\non the relational and embodied dimensions of the self to ask whether\nautonomy skills can be exercised by what she calls the\n\u201cself-as-embodied\u201d and the\n\u201cself-as-relational\u201d (Meyers 2005). There is little\ndiscussion in the literature on autonomy of the embodied dimensions of\nagency and autonomy, so here Meyers has identified a fruitful avenue\nof further research (see also Mackenzie 2001).\n\nFourth, Meyers addresses the question of whether the authentic or\n\u201ctrue self\u201d required for autonomy must be unified (Meyers\n2000b). Notions such as wholehearted endorsement seem to imply a\nfurther requirement of coherence among mental states. Indeed, Benson\nsuggests that coherence is a feature common to procedural conceptions\nthat are \u201cidentity-based\u201d, namely, those claiming that\npreferences and actions are \u201cgenuinely my own because\nthey are appropriately related to my identity\u201d (Benson 2005b,\n102\u20133). An important theme in contemporary feminist thought,\nhowever, is the rejection of the position that coherence is necessary\nfor an agent\u2019s sense of identity. Rather, identity is said to be\n\u201cintersectional\u201d: an agent\u2019s sense of self is\nsubject to multiple and intersecting modes of oppression, for\ninstance, those of class, gender, race, and sexuality (e.g., Crenshaw\n1991). Intersecting oppressions can lead to ambivalence or to a sense\nof self in which preferences pull in competing directions (e.g.,\nBenson 2005b, 105\u20136). Meyers argues for a conception of\nauthenticity that incorporates the lessons of intersectionality\n(Meyers 2000b).\n\nThe procedural theories defended by feminists have many strengths, the\nmost noteworthy of which is the commitment to content-neutrality.\nHowever, procedural theories have been found wanting by critics for\ntwo important reasons. First, they do not put enough weight on the\neffects of internalized oppression on agents\u2019 motivational\nstates. And, second, procedural theories overlook the constitutive\nrole of external conditions in the definition of autonomy. Consider\nagents for whom certain norms are ingrained through oppressive\nsocialization, such as the eighteen-year-old student described in\n\u00a72. She treats norms about beauty and fashion as important and\nperhaps overriding reasons for action because she has internalized the\nidea that appearance is a criterion of self-worth. Due to the effects\nof the oppressive ideology, the agent treats false stereotypes as\n\u201cnatural\u201d, and formulates desires and plans based on the\nstereotype. On procedural accounts, false stereotypes that have been\ninternalized by the agent may well be the agent\u2019s own\nbecause they may be the products of reflective endorsement or the\nexercise of autonomy competency. This conclusion seems inadequate to\nmany authors. For example, Benson has objected to Christman\u2019s\nversion of a historical procedural account that, in cases like that of\nthe student, because the norms are so deeply ingrained, it is not\nplausible to think that she resisted or even would have\nresisted the process of development of the stereotype even had she\nbeen aware of the process (Benson 1991). Hence procedural accounts\noften cannot adequately explain why cases of internalized oppression\nappear to be nonautonomous. A second reason that procedural approaches\nhave been deemed unsatisfactory is that it has been argued that\nseverely constraining external circumstances, including the lack of a\nsufficient number of real options, compromise agents\u2019 freedom\nand autonomy (Raz 1988; Brison 2000; Nussbaum 2001; Oshana 2006).\n",
