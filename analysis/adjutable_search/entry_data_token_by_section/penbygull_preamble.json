    "main_text": "\n\nWyclif's logico-metaphysical works were very influential at Oxford at\nthe end of the 14th century and the beginning of the 15th. Among the\nauthors who followed his doctrines (the so called Oxford Realists),\nWilliam Penbygull (+1420) was almost certainly the most faithful to\nthe master, since his extant writings appear to be essentially devoted\nto a defence and/or explanation of Wyclif's main philosophical theses.\nNotwithstanding such an attitude, Penbygull made an original\ncontribution to logic by developing a new theory of identity, which\nsolved the problems that Wyclif's analysis of predication had raised,\nand by refining Wyclif's theory of predication itself. \n",
