    "main_text": "A Historical Primer\n1. A Historical Primer\n\nIn the opening sentence of its preamble, the 1948 Declaration of Human\nRights affirms the \u201cinherent dignity\u201d and \u201cequal and\ninalienable rights of all members of the human family\u201d as the\n\u201cfoundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\u201d\n(UN 1948). This claim would surprise our modern ancestors. Until about\n1830\u20131850, neither the English term \u201cdignity,\u201d nor\nits Latin root dignitas, nor the French counterpart\ndignit\u00e9, had any stable currency as meaning \u201cthe\nunearned status or worth of all persons\u201d, let alone the grounds\nof universal rights or equality. Instead, in everything from\nHobbes\u2019s Leviathan (1651) to Samuel Johnson\u2019s\nDictionary (1755) to Webster\u2019s Compendious\nDictionary (1806), \u201cdignity\u201d was primarily used with\na conventional merit connotation\u2014something like the \u201crank\nof elevation\u201d that Johnson officially gave it.\n\nHow did this sea change in meaning come about? The UN Declaration\nmakes clear that dignity\u2019s moral-political meaning had become\nnormalized by 1948. But what happened before 1948 that explains this\ntransformation? These are not easy questions to answer. Although\ntheorists often include historical remarks in their inquiries, they\nare just as often brief and subservient to some further,\nnon-historical point. The result is a great many half-told stories\nabout dignity\u2019s past.\n\nThere are some notable exceptions. For some time, legal theorists have\nbeen etching out the details of dignity\u2019s historical role in law\nand jurisprudence, especially in connection to rights. Second,\ntheological inquiries into human dignity often engage an older history\nof ideas, especially the Renaissance thinker Pico della Mirandola or\nscholastic debates about the biblical doctrine of imago Dei.\nThird, there is a considerable body of literature on the Enlightenment\nluminaire, Immanuel Kant, and his famous claim that humans do not have\na \u201cprice\u201d, only a distinctive and incomparable worth or\nW\u00fcrde\u2014usually translated as \u201cdignity\u201d\n(see, e.g., Korsgaard 1986; Meyer 1987; Hill 1992; Kofman 1982 [1997];\nWood 1999; Kain 2009). Let us turn to these various exceptions, and\ntheir challenges.\n",
