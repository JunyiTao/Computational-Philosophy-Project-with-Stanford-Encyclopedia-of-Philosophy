Similarly, in order to discuss how properties of\nthe microscopic particle before the measurement are related to measurement\noutcomes, one needs a decomposition at \\(t_1\\) that includes these properties,\nthe \\([s^j]\\) in \\eqref{eqn23} for the simple model or the \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) in\n\\eqref{eqn38} for a generalized measurement. There is no fundamental quantum\nprinciple that forces one to use these decompositions. The choice is based on\nutility, and illustrates the importance of principle R4 in \n section 5. If\none wants to discuss measurements as measurements, one needs\nto adopt a framework in which the associated concepts make sense. And,\nsince it is often misunderstood, it is worth emphasizing that neither\nthe validity nor the utility of a particular framework is in any way\nreduced by the existence of other frameworks which are incompatible\n(or incommensurate) with it.\n\nThe models employed here are a bit simplistic compared to the experimental\nsituation in a laboratory. However, extending them to something more realistic\nposes difficulties no worse than those encountered when introducing\nquasiclassical descriptions. Thus, rather than a pure initial\nstate \\(\\ket{m_0}\\) for the apparatus it is more realistic to use a macroscopic\nprojector of the type mentioned in \n section 6, or else an initial density\noperator. These changes present no difficulty in principle, and some\nof them are discussed in Ch. 17 of Griffiths (2002a). The role of\ndecoherence is to allow a consistent quasiclassical description, as\nnoted in\n section 6. By itself decoherence does not\nresolve either of the measurement problems; see, e.g., Adler\n(2003).\nFinally, while wave function collapse is a legitimate calculational\nprocedure when describing a preparation in quantum mechanical terms,\nit amounts to nothing more than a convenient way of calculating\nconditional probabilities useful in the quantum description of a\npreparation. Trying to view it as some sort of mysterious physical\nprocess leads to confusion and the incorrect notion that quantum\nmechanics is somehow inconsistent with special relativity, which is\nour next topic.\n",
