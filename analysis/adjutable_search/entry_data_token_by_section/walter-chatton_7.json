    "main_text": "Categories and Universals || Ontological Classes\n4.2 Ontological Classes\n\nChatton thinks that there are ten categories and that they are those\nten, namely substance, quantity, quality,\nrelation, time, place, action,\npassion, position, and state or\nhaving, because there are ten basic classes of real things\nfor which we construct specific definitions, the terms of which come\nout of the categories. The categories are devised to define and thus\nneatly map onto ontological classes. Chatton disapproves of\nOckham\u2019s contention that there are ten categories for only two\nsorts of things, substances and some of their qualities. To establish\nhis ontological claim, Chatton argues for each class on a case-by-case\nbasis, employing the Chatton Principle (see above 3.2). He had already\ndone this in the case of relations in the earlier Reportatio,\narguing that we are ontologically committed to certain classes of\nrelational entities in order to make the propositions \u201ca heat\ncauses heat\u201d or \u201cthe soul causes an intellection\u201d\nand \u201cPlato generates Socrates\u201d true. Now, in the\nLectura, he argues that we must grant the existence of\nsubstances, qualities, and quantities as really distinct from one\nanother as well as from relations, which include not only relations\nproper but also the six kinds of relations picked out by the last six\ncategories, namely time, place, action,\npassion, position, and state. Here is a\nreconstruction of his argument for quantities found in\nLectura 1, d. 8, q. 1, paragraph 109:\n\nSuppose this proposition \\(p\\) is true: \u201cit is naturally\nimpossible for the quantities of two hosts in the Eucharist to exist\nin the same spatial arrangement at the same time.\u201d\nNeither substances nor qualities are sufficient to make \\(p\\) true\nbecause substances and qualities, if posited, are consistent with\n\\(p\\) being false.\nThe existence of substances, qualities, and quantities is\nsufficient to make \\(p\\) true because substances, qualities and\nquantities, if posited, are inconsistent with \\(p\\) being false.\nTherefore, we must posit the existence of quantities.\n\n\nChatton\u2019s appeal to the Eucharist, where a piece of bread\nmiraculously converts into the substance of the body of Christ, is\nunsurprising in the late medieval context though striking to modern\neyes. Transubstantiation forced medieval theologians, trained in\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics and natural philosophy, to think about a\nnumber of philosophical issues including the inherence (or\nnon-inherence) of accidents in their substances but also the\nontological status of quantity. Prior to consecration, the host is a\npiece of bread whose substance is bread substance and has various\nperceptible accidental qualities and quantities, e.g. being-white,\nbeing-round, having such and such dimensions, etc. During\nconsecration, when the bread substance has been converted into the\nsubstance of the body of Christ, all the bread\u2019s perceptible\naccidents remain present yet without being anchored in the bread\nsubstance.\n\nWith respect to premise (2), Chatton argues that substances, at least\nextended substances, cannot make \\(p\\) true, since there are no such\nsubstances on the altar at all. The substance of the body of Christ is\npresent in every consecrated host, on every altar, but unextended\nwhile the extended substance of the bread is of course absent. Nor\ndoes Chatton think that \\(p\\) is true of qualities because qualities\nclearly can naturally exist in the same spatial arrangement at the\nsame time. The very same body or parts of a body can be white and cold\nall over and at once. So, neither extended substances nor qualities\nsuffice to make \\(p\\) true. A third entity is necessary and this,\nChatton thinks, is a quantity, an entity of which it is true to say\nthat two such entities cannot naturally exist in the same spatial\narrangement at the same time. No two quantities, or quantified bodies,\ncan naturally penetrate one another; rather, the one will push out the\nother. Interestingly, Chatton associates quantity principally with\nimpenetrability rather than extension, conceding to Ockham that\nsubstances and qualities may be extended by themselves and\nirrespective of having any quantity. They cannot, however, be\nimpenetrable without some quantity. This explains why \\(p\\) refers to\ntwo hosts that cannot naturally interpenetrate rather than one whose\nparts are extended to establish the category of quantity.\n",
