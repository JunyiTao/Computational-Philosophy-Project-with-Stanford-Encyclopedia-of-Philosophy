    "main_text": "Middle Knowledge\n4. Middle Knowledge\n\nA possible way to reconcile libertarian views of freedom with a strong\nview of divine providence was posed by the sixteenth-century Spanish\nJesuit, Luis de Molina\n (1588).[3]\n According to Molina, God is able to know as creator how any\nexercise of creaturely freedom will go. That is, God knows, for any\ncreature he might create, how that creature will behave in whatever\ncircumstances he might be placed. God is able to know this, moreover,\neven though the creatures in question will, if created, enjoy\nlibertarian freedom. This kind of knowledge, which Molina called\nmiddle\n knowledge,[4]\n is comprised in what we may call subjunctives of freedom.\nConsider, for example, the situation in which I will find myself later\ntoday, when I deliberate about whether to attend the concert tonight.\nIt is possible to formulate two subjunctive conditional propositions\nabout that situation. The first states that if ever I were placed in\nthe circumstances (call them C) that will then obtain, I\nwould decide (freely) to attend the concert; the second states that in\nthose circumstances, I would not so decide. Let these be symbolized as\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p and\nC\u00a0>\u00a0~p, respectively. Both\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p and\nC\u00a0>\u00a0~p count as subjunctives of\nfreedom, and since we are imagining that I will be placed in\nC later today, it is plausible to think that one or the other\nof them is true. Let us suppose it is\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p. According to defenders of middle\nknowledge, God knows prior to any creative act on his part that\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is true; hence he knows this\nprior to my existence, and prior to any act of mine. We need not take\nthe \u201cprior\u201d here as temporal, if we hold that God exists\noutside of time. The idea, rather, is that the truth of\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is logically or ontologically\nprior to any creative decision on God\u2019s part, and to any doing\nof mine, in that its truth is fixed independently of these matters.\nFurther, God is able to know that\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is true independently of any\ndecision of his, and without appealing to any actual decision on my\npart as evidence. Finally, God is armed with true subjunctives of\nfreedom for every other set of circumstances in which I might ever\nhave been placed, and the same for every other free individual he has\nthe option of creating, whether he actually chooses to create the\ncreature or not. In effect, then, middle knowledge gives God advance\nnotice of every free decision or action that would ever occur, on the\npart of any creature he might create (Flint 1998, 37\u201341).\n\nAssuming it is a legitimate notion, middle knowledge does much to\nrestore God\u2019s providence in creating free creatures. Once armed\nwith information about how such a creature would decide and act in the\nvarious circumstances in which he might be placed, God has the option\nof not creating the creature, or of creating him in whatever\ncircumstances are called for by the subjunctives of freedom God wishes\nto be realized in the actual world. Now of course the circumstances in\nwhich one creature is placed may depend in part on how others choose\nto exercise their freedom. But the willings of those others can in\nturn be providentially arranged, since they too fall under middle\nknowledge. In principle, then, nothing need occur in the actual world\nthat does not have God\u2019s prior recognition and consent, at\nleast. There may, of course, be much that does not go as God would\nprefer. It is important to realize that middle knowledge does not\nrestore complete sovereignty to God. If\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p is true, then there is no way for\nGod to create me in circumstances C and have me do anything\nbut decide to go to the concert. The best he can do is alter my\ncircumstances to fit some true subjunctive of freedom that has another\noutcome. And the same goes for the subjunctives of freedom that hold\nof all other creatures God might create. This means there is quite a\nrange of worlds which, though logically possible, are not\nfeasible for God, in that they are beyond his reach as\ncreator (Flint 1998, 71). From God\u2019s point of view, free\ncreatures will behave as they will behave, and that is that. Still,\nGod can know in advance of creation what worlds are feasible, and can\nplan accordingly, which is a vast improvement over the Boethian view.\nThe position as regards omniscience is also improved. There is still a\nkind of transition called for \u2014 this time commencing from a\npoint at which God merely contemplates the possibilities of how things\nmight go with creation, to a point at which, having decided\nwhat creatures and circumstances will in fact populate the world, he\nknows how things will go. Again, however, it might be\npossible to work out a way in which the transition can be understood\nnon-temporally. And the Molinist position offers a further advantage\nover that of Boethius, in that now God\u2019s knowledge about how\nexercises of creaturely freedom will actually go will be guaranteed\nsimply by his decision as to what creatures and circumstances he will\ncreate, rather than awaiting the actual decisions and actions of free\nbeings. This diminishes God\u2019s passivity; it enables him to know\nas creator how the history of creation will\n unfold.[5]\n\nBut is middle knowledge a legitimate notion? Many have\nthought not. One serious objection against it is that there does not\nappear to be any way God could come by such knowledge. Knowledge, as\nwe have seen, is not merely a matter of conceiving a proposition and\ncorrectly believing it to be true. It requires justification:\none must have good reasons for believing. But what justification could\nGod have for believing the propositions that are supposed to\nconstitute middle knowledge? The truth of subjunctives of freedom\ncannot be discerned a priori, for they are contingent. It is not a\nnecessary truth that if placed in circumstances C, I will\ndecide to attend the concert tonight. Nor can we allow that God might\nlearn the truth of C\u00a0>\u00a0p from my actual\nbehavior \u2014 that is, by observing that I actually do, in\ncircumstances C, decide to attend the concert. For God could\nnot make observations like this without also finding out what creative\ndecisions he is actually going to make, which would destroy the whole\npurpose of middle knowledge. Instead of being guided in his creative\nchoices by knowing what decisions creatures would make if\nthey were created, God would be presented from the beginning with a\nfait accompli \u2014 with the reality that he was\ngoing to create certain creatures, and they were going to\nbehave in certain ways. For God\u2019s options as creator to remain\ntruly open, middle knowledge must have some other justification.\nFurthermore, it seems clear that observation of the actual behavior of\ncreatures could not possibly inform God of the truth of those\nsubjunctives of freedom that delineate the behavior of creatures he\nwill not choose to create, for in their case there is no\npertinent reality to consult. Yet Molinism wishes to allow for the\npossibility of such creatures. It is apparent, then, that neither\nconceptual resources nor resources founded in the concrete world will\nenable God to know in advance of his decisions as creator which\ncounterfactuals of freedom are true. If there is a third resource, no\none has said what it is. Thus, while God may firmly believe certain\nsubjunctives of freedom, there appears to be no justification\navailable to him that would allow such beliefs to constitute middle\n knowledge.[6]\n\nNote that the above objection is not based on the claim some have\nmade, that subjunctives of freedom lack truth values, or that their\ntruth is not properly grounded (R.M. Adams 1977; Hasker 1989). That\nmay indeed be a problem for some subjunctives of freedom, but it is\nnot a problem for C\u00a0>\u00a0p. On the usual\nunderstanding, a subjunctive of freedom counts as true provided that,\namong worlds in which its antecedent is satisfied, there is at least\none in which the consequent is satisfied as well, and which is more\nsimilar to our world than any in which the consequent is not\nsatisfied. Now no world can be as similar to the actual world as that\nworld is to itself, and we are assuming that C and p\nare true in the actual world. Accordingly,\nC\u00a0>\u00a0p must be true as well. The only\nway to avoid this outcome is to deny that propositions like p\n\u2014 that is, propositions which describe future free decisions in\nthe actual world \u2014 have truth values, and we have already seen\nthat this will not do. So C\u00a0>\u00a0p is\nperfectly well grounded. The problem is only that it is not grounded\nin the way it needs to be to serve as middle knowledge. It is not\ngrounded independently of God\u2019s or my free decisions.\nIn light of this, we can only conclude that the Molinist effort to\nreconcile creaturely freedom with God\u2019s omniscience and\nsovereignty as creator fails. We have yet to see how God can know as\ncreator what decisions and actions his creatures will engage in, while\nat the same time upholding the idea that those decisions and actions\nare manifestations of libertarian freedom.\n\nThe objections to Molinism presented in the last two paragraphs are\ntypical of most objections to Molinism in that they focus on the key\nidea of the subjunctive of freedom, also often called a counterfactual\nof creaturely freedom (CCF). Ken Perszyk, in his survey of the debate\nover Molinism, divides those objections up into three categories: (1)\narguments that there can be no true CCFs, or at least not enough true\nCCFs for Molinist purposes, (2) arguments that there cannot be true\nCCFs prior to God\u2019s creative decisions, and (3) the argument\nthat we have seen already, that God cannot know CCFs prior to his\ncreative decisions. See Perszyk 2013 for a more thorough discussion of\nthe varieties of such arguments.\n",
