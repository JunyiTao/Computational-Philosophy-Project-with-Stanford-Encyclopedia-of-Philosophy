    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Dewey (1859\u20131952) was an American philosopher, associated with\npragmatism. His immense philosophical and other written output\nencompasses most areas of philosophy as well as a host of other\neducational, social and political concerns. Although much of\nDewey\u2019s political writing is prompted by specific issues, his\noverall orientation is deeply shaped by his pragmatism or (as he\npreferred) \u201cexperimentalism\u201d. At the core of his political\nthinking are the beliefs that science and democracy are mutually\nsupportive and interdependent enterprises, that they are egalitarian,\nprogressive and rest on habits of open social communication, and that\npowerful interpretations of liberal individualism and democracy have\nbecome ossified and self-defeating.\n\nDewey\u2019s earliest philosophical work was deeply influenced by the\nidealism imbibed from his teacher and colleague George S. Morris.\nThrough the 1890s, and particularly after moving to the newly founded\nUniversity of Chicago in 1894, Dewey began a steady drift away from\nidealist metaphysics, a process that he describes in an\nautobiographical essay \u201cFrom Absolutism to\nExperimentalism\u201d. Influenced notably by William James\u2019s\nPrinciples of Psychology (1890), Dewey came to repudiate both\nthe Idealist\u2019s claim that the study of empirical phenomena leads\nto the conclusion that the world is mind, and the belief that the only\nalternative to this is an atomistic empiricism. Yet he retained the\nIdealist ambition of articulating a unified account of human progress.\nWhile at Chicago Dewey\u2019s interest in educational theory and\nconception of the school as a central institution for a democratic\nsociety came to fruition, in the foundation of the University\nElementary School (the \u201cLab School\u201d), and in books such as\nThe School and Society (1899), The Child and the\nCurriculum (1902), and later in the culminating statement\nDemocracy and Education (1916). After a dispute with the\nuniversity president, Dewey left Chicago in 1904 for Columbia\nUniversity, where he remained until his retirement.\n\nThe period between the wars also saw an imposing series of books\narticulating and developing his philosophical beliefs. This includes\nReconstruction in Philosophy (1920), Human Nature and\nConduct (1922), Experience and Nature (1925), The\nQuest for Certainty (1929), Art as Experience (1934),\nA Common Faith (1934), Logic: The Theory of Inquiry\n(1938), and Theory of Valuation (1939). The Public and\nIts Problems (1927) contained a defence of participatory\ndemocratic ideals against sceptics such as Walter Lippmann, who argued\nthat there was only space for a minimally democratic politics in\ncomplex modern societies. Dewey was a critic of laissez-faire\nliberalism and its accompanying individualistic view of society from\nhis early writings. This criticism was amplified during the\nDepression, where he expressed a form of liberal and democratic\nsocialism in writings such as Individualism, Old and New\n(1930), Liberalism and Social Action (1935), and Freedom\nand Culture (1939).\n\nAs a public intellectual, Dewey was a supporter of such causes as\nwomen\u2019s suffrage and the Settlement House movement (he was a\nfrequent visitor to the philosopher Jane Addams\u2019s and Ellen\nGates Starr\u2019s famous Hull House in Chicago). He lectured to\ninternational audiences and his educational writing in particular was\ninfluential in a wide range of settings, including notably China. His\nimmense range of public and political activities included presidency\nof the teachers\u2019 union, sponsorship of the American Civil\nLiberties Union and NAACP, support for the Outlawry of War movement in\nthe interwar years, chairing the People\u2019s Lobby, and (persuaded\nby his student, the philosopher Sidney Hook) participation in the\n\u201ctrial\u201d of Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1938. After his move\nto New York, and particularly after the onset of the First World War,\na substantial part of his published output consisted of commentary on\ncurrent domestic and international politics, and public statements on\nbehalf of many causes, both domestic and international. (He is\nprobably the only philosopher in this Encyclopaedia to have published\nboth on the Treaty of Versailles and on the value of displaying art in\npost offices.) Among these commitments, his support for the entry of\nthe United States into the First World War was hugely controversial,\nstrained or broke many of his ties with the American left, and came to\nbe a source of profound disillusionment. In a way, it marked the\nhighpoint of his belief that the American state could be tethered to\ndemocratic goals without thoroughgoing reconstruction. He went on to\nbe a prominent critic from the left of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal\nwhile also opposing Soviet communism and its western apologists. By\nthe time of his death he was lionized as a national sage (as with\nBertrand Russell, this status was compatible with his promotion of\ncontroversial and often radical public positions). Although his\nphilosophical reputation and public status dimmed somewhat in\nsubsequent years, his work has consolidated in stature as an important\nreference point and resource for democratic theory.\n",
