    "main_text": "Virtues and Intentions\n9. Conclusion\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that Walter Chatton was not a very original\nphilosopher. There is some fairness in this claim, but it is also a\nlittle misleading. What is true is that he is not as recognizably\nimportant a figure today as Ockham or Aquinas, and that his philosophy\ntends to be negative (i.e., critical) and conservative in character,\nin the following respect: in many of his writings we find him\nattacking the novel work of others, frequently Ockham, and sometimes\ndefending the more accepted work of others, frequently Scotus.\nMoreover, he did not strive to develop and set out a unique systematic\nview of reality, that is, a system of his own. But, in\nfairness, such was not the goal of philosophical theology in the\nfourteenth century. Moreover, as the examples above show, Chatton was\nphilosophically quite creative, and incisive in his attacks on\nOckham\u2019s thought. So while we find no evidence of a large\nfollowing after his death (there was no large Chattonian\n\u2018school\u2019 or \u2018movement\u2019 that we know of), he\ndid have considerable influence well into the middle of the fifteenth\ncentury in England, particularly on those who reacted strongly to\nOckham\u2019s nominalism and semantic theory, and also in the\nintricate and intense debate over future contingents.\n",
