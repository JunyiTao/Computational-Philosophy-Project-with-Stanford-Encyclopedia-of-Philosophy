For instance, absolutism is\nsometimes conflated with realism, and idealism with relationalism. One\nreason for the first conflation may be historical in nature. In their\ncelebrated correspondence, which forms part of the essential\nbackground to Kant\u2019s work on space and time in the\nCritique, Clarke and Leibniz often consider the proposition:\nspace is real. By our lights, realism and anti-realism\nconcern the question of whether something is in some sense dependent\non the mind. We ask this question about tables and chairs, numbers and\nsets, and all manner of other things. But when Leibniz and Clarke\ndiscuss the \u201creality,\u201d or the \u201cabsolute\nreality,\u201d of space, they are typically concerned with the\nquestion of space\u2019s status vis-\u00e0-vis objects. This is\nclearly the case when Leibniz and Clarke consider one of the principal\nquestions of their correspondence, whether their common acceptance of\nthe principle of sufficient reason entails that one of them holds the\ncorrect conception of space (cf. L3: 4 and C 3: 4\u20135). Leibniz\ncontends, while Clarke denies, that if space were independent of\nobjects, God would lack a sufficient reason for placing the objects of\nthe universe into space with one orientation rather than another.\nLeibniz concludes from this that space lacks \u201creality\u201d or\nthat it lacks \u201cabsolute reality\u201d (see L5: 29 and L5: 36).\nBased on precisely the same considerations, Leibniz denies\nthat space is \u201cabsolute\u201d (L3: 2\u20133, L3: 5, L4: 16, L4:\n9\u201310) and contends that it is \u201crelative\u201d (L3: 4).\nHence in this context, for space to be real is for space to\nexist independently of objects and relations.\n\nLikewise, Leibniz\u2019s contention that space is ideal (L5:\n33) serves as his response to Clarke\u2019s claim (C4: 7) that there\ncan be \u201cextramundane\u201d space, that is, space beyond the\nboundaries of the object-universe. Here, too, the contention that\nspace is ideal\u2014or that it lacks reality\u2014amounts to the\ncontention that it cannot exist independently of objects.\nThis is evident in a passage from Leibniz\u2019s last letter:\n\nI have demonstrated that space is nothing other than an order of the\nexistence of things observed in their simultaneity. And therefore the\nfiction of a material finite universe, moving forward in an infinite\nempty space, cannot be admitted. It is altogether unreasonable and\nimpracticable. For, besides that there is no real space out of the\nmaterial universe, such an action would be without any design in it:\nit would be working without doing any thing\u2026It would produce no\nchange which could be observed by any person whatsoever. These are\nimaginations of philosophers who have incomplete notions, who make of\nspace an absolute reality [r\u00e9alit\u00e9 absolue] (L 5: 29).\n\n\nNote that by \u201creal space out of the material universe\u201d\nLeibniz does not mean space independent of the mind, but\nrather, space independent of objects.\n\nThis is not to say that there is no discussion of space\u2019s status\nrelative to the mind in the correspondence. Leibniz asserts in his\nlast letter that relations are \u201cideal\u201d because they are\nneither substances nor accidents, and are therefore not elements of\nreality (L5: 47). As he writes in the New Essays, in reality\nthere are only substances and properties of substances; the mind\n\u201cadds\u201d relations (New Essays, 2.12; cf. also\n2.30.4 and 2.25.1). Since space is the order of the possible relations\nof objects, it is presumably ideal in the sense of being\nmind-dependent. But Leibniz\u2019s point here seems to be that just\nas people reify relations, thinking they exist independently of\nobjects, they reify space, thinking it too exists independently of\nobjects. So even when Leibniz discusses the ideality of space, he does\nso to indicate that we need not think of relations and of space as\nabsolute in order to account for the tendency toward reification.\n\nThe ideality and reality of space bear a different significance for\nKant than they do for Leibniz and Clarke. For Kant, asking whether\nsomething is real or ideal concerns its status vis-\u00e0-vis the\nmind. One of Kant\u2019s most explicit discussions of realism and\nidealism appears in the Fourth Paralogism (A368\u2013380), where he is\nconcerned with the possible mind-dependent status of objects and with\nthe status of our knowledge of their existence. Although it is clear\nthat Kant is discussing the status of spatial objects vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe mind, in part by discussing the relation of space and time to\nthe mind, there is no treatment here of the status of space and\ntime vis-\u00e0-vis objects per se.\n\nBut I understand under the transcendental idealism of all\nappearances the doctrine according to which they are all together to\nbe regarded as mere representations, and not as things in themselves,\nand accordingly that space and time are only sensible forms of our\nintuition, but not determinations given for themselves, or conditions\nof objects as things in themselves. This idealism is opposed by\ntranscendental realism, which considers space and time as\nsomething given in themselves (independent of our sensibility). The\ntranscendental realist therefore represents outer appearances (when\none grants their reality) as things in themselves, which would exist\nindependently of us and our sensibility, and therefore also would be\noutside us according to pure concepts of the understanding. (A369)\n\n\nIn light of these points, consider the following table:\n\n\n\n Realist relationalism\n\nSpace is the order of possible relations among objects\nRelations are mind-independent\n \n Idealist relationalism\n\nSpace is the order of possible relations among objects\nRelations are mind-dependent\n  \n\n Realist absolutism\n\nSpace is an object-independent framework for object relations\nSpace is mind-independent\n \n Idealist absolutism {?}\n\nSpace is an object-independent framework for object relations\nSpace is mind-dependent\n   \n\n\nA realist can be a relationalist if she thinks space is the order of\nactual and possible relations among actual (and maybe possible)\nobjects and she thinks those relations are real. This\nindicates, incidentally, that realists about space need not think of\nit as a kind of object: it can be perfectly real and\nthe order of possible relations among objects. Indeed, Kant himself\nmay have held this view in his Physical Monadology of 1755:\nhe still accepted Leibinzian relationalism, but he rejected the\nLeibnizian construal of relations, holding them to be aspects of\n reality.[17]\n Similarly, some contemporary defenders of relationalism seem to hold\nthe view that space is the order of actual and possible relations\namong actual and possible objects, and those relations are perfectly\nreal, that is, they are not dependent on the mind in any sense.\n\nAbsolutism raises other difficulties. It is possible to think of space\nas an instantaneous framework projected onto reality by the\n mind.[18]\n If space is such a mind-dependent framework, it could still be\nthought of as independent of objects. At any rate, if absolutism\nindicates that space is independent of all objects and relations, and\nif that is held to entail that it must be independent of the mind as\nwell, we probably require some clarification of this entailment, for\nit is not obvious (Ishiguro 1972, 109). In fact, Kant may have\ndefended an absolutist-idealist conception of space in the\nInaugural Dissertation of 1770 (Friedman 1992, 29\u201331).\nClarity can be achieved only if one avoids conflating these myriad\nviews.\n\nKant consistently writes in the Critique of ideality and\nreality in the more familiar modern sense, where mind-dependence is at\nissue. His usage serves to shift the philosophical discussion\nconcerning space from a focus on relationalism and absolutism to one\non idealism and realism. Hence when he reflects on the Newtonian and\nLeibnizian conceptions of space and time in general terms in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, he eschews a discussion of the relative\nmerits of absolutism and relationalism in favor of discussing the\ncommon mistake of his predecessors. For instance, after outlining his\nconception of space and time, Kant claims: \u201cThose, however, who\nassert the absolute reality [absolute Realit\u00e4t] of space\nand time, whether they take it to be subsisting or only inhering, must\nthemselves come into conflict with the principles\n[Principien] of experience\u201d (A39/B56). The former\ngroup, also called \u201cthe mathematical investigators of\nnature,\u201d is clearly identified with the Newtonians, and the\nlatter, the \u201cmetaphysicians of nature,\u201d with the\nLeibnizians (cf. Shabel 2005, 31, 45\u20139). So transcendental idealism is\narticulated as a kind of replacement for the Leibnizian and\nNewtonian conceptions of space and time, but it is not their status as\nrelationalist and absolutist conceptions, respectively, that calls for\ntheir replacement. Rather, it is their status as representatives of a\nseparate and overarching conception of space, a conception according\nto which space (like time) is said to bear an \u201cabsolute\nreality.\u201d This occurrence of \u2018absolute\u2019 clearly\ncannot have the meaning that Leibniz and Clarke intend.\n\nThis raises a difficult question. Kant contends that transcendental\nidealism as a general conception of space is to be contrasted with\ntranscendental realism, a position he attributes both to Newton and to\nLeibniz. Yet from Leibniz\u2019s point of view, the only elements of\nreality are substances and their properties. Relations, which are\nneither substances nor properties, are not among such elements, if we\nare speaking with metaphysical rigor. This is evident in a number of\ntexts; for instance, in response to his Lockean interlocutor, Leibniz\nwrites in the New Essays: \u201cThis division of the objects\nof our thoughts into substances, modes, and relations is pretty much\nto my liking. I believe that qualities are nothing but modifications\nof substances and the understanding adds relations\n[l\u2019entendement y adjoute les relations].\u201d He adds that\nrelations are \u201cthe work of the understanding\u201d (New\nEssays, 145). Since space for Leibniz is just the order of object\nrelations, and relations are ideal, space too is ideal in some sense\n(New Essays, 145; cf. Cassirer 1902, 248). That is to say,\nthere is a sense in which spatiality does not characterize reality\n(Adams 1994, 254\u20135). These views are to be found in the letters to\nClarke and in the New Essays, both of which Kant read, and\nKant himself explicitly mentions some of\n them.[19]\n The obvious obstacles to understanding Leibniz as a realist\ncomplicate the interpretation of transcendental idealism, since Kant\nclearly thinks it is an alternative to both Leibniz\u2019s and\nNewton\u2019s allegedly realist views. This problem is tackled\nin the next section.\n",
