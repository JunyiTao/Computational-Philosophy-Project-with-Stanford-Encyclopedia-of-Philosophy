    "main_text": "Philosophy || Ontology\n3.1 Ontology\n\nFrom the neo-Platonic On Causes (Liber de causis)\nBoethius borrowed the term fixio. To be \u201cfixed\u201d\nis to have a place in reality. The First Cause is fixed entirely by\nitself, lower entities (separate substances, material substances,\nmatter, accidents) all need the support of the First Cause, and, as\none descends the hierarchy, increasingly more support from elsewhere.\nThe relation between the First Cause and other beings is also called\nfactio, \u201cmaking\u201d, but this does not imply\ncreation in the traditional sense; it does, however, mean that\neverything \u201cmade\u201d is existentially dependent on the First\nCause and thus fundamentally contingent (Ebbesen 2005, Donati\n2017).\n\nBoethius may be classified as a moderate realist. \n\n\nEvery being (ens) is either a thing (res) or a mode\nof a thing (modus rei). [\u2026] Among things, some are\nnatural, others mathematical, and a third group divine. [\u2026]\nEvery mode of a thing is reducible to the thing itself as its cause\nand has been derived from it, for it cannot be a pure figment of the\nintellect. (Quaest. Top., 3\u20134) \n\n\nBoethius operates with \u201cthings\u201d (res) on such a\nhigh level of abstraction that, like Avicennian quiddities or common\nnatures, they are undetermined as to particularity or universality,\nbut have modes or ways of being (modi essendi) either this or\nthat; thus the concrete term album \u201c(something)\nwhite\u201d and the abstract albedo \u201cwhiteness\u201d\nsignify the same, though in different ways, reflecting two different\nmodes of being of that \u201cthing\u201d (Ebbesen 1988). On the\nother hand, he is clear that the fundamental furniture of the world\nconsists of particulars, and while believing in essences, he refuses\nto hypostatize them: he rejects the notion that existence\n(esse) is accidental to essence and that an uninstantiated\nuniversal can function as a verifier of a proposition by virtue of\nsome \u201cessential being\u201d (esse essentiale), as some\nof his contemporaries claimed.\n\nOrdinary things, including humans, are compounds of matter and a form.\nThe human form, the soul, has several functions, but it is not a\ncompound of several forms\u2014one like that of inorganic things, one\nlike that of plants, one like that of irrational animals and, finally,\nan intellect:\u2014it is one and the same formal entity that takes\ncare of the different functions that some of Boethius\u2019\ncontemporaries assigned to semi-independent parts of the whole soul.\nOn this point he agrees with Thomas Aquinas. He also holds that the\nintellect is an eternal substance and can be separated from the body,\nbut, he says, then it ceases to be a form and a soul. Hence, in\nwhichever sense somebody\u2019s intellect continues to exist as a\nsubstance after the person\u2019s death, it would seem that it ceases\nto be human. Boethius does not, in his preserved writings, expand on\nhow to understand the continued existence of the human intellect after\ndeath, but whatever he thought about this matter, his theory can\nhardly have made room for a bodily resurrection of human individuals,\nwhich, by his own lights, was all right (see\n \u00a73.3.2,\n below). That had to be left to faith. (For the questions treated in\nthis paragraph, see in particular Wielockx 2009: 50\u201355. The\nunity of the human form is strongly defended in the sophisma Omnis\nhomo &c.).\n",
