    "main_text": "Quinean Epistemology || The Epistemological Project\n4.1 The Epistemological Project\n\nAs we saw in section 2, Quine takes the fundamental epistemological\nproblem to be that of showing how we come to have knowledge of the\nworld. He seeks an account which is naturalistic in his austere sense,\nand thus starts with the idea that we know about the world only from\nimpacts of various forms of energy on our sensory nerves (see 2.3,\nabove). How do we get from such impacts to something recognizable as\nknowledge of the world? In the words of the title of Quine\u2019s\nlast monograph: how do we get from stimulus to science?\n\nThis question is central for Quine\u2019s scientific naturalism in\ngeneral. An answer would show that that world-view can accommodate an\naccount of human knowledge. If no answer is available, that world-view\nis cast in doubt. For these purposes it is perhaps enough if Quine can\nsketch an account, compatible with his naturalistic view, of how we\nmight acquire the knowledge which we take ourselves to have,\nwhether or not it is correct in detail. (See Quine 1990c, 291.)\n\nQuine treats knowledge as embodied in language. Apart from other\nconsiderations, language-use is observable and thus subject to\nscientific inquiry. Quine\u2019s concern with how we might acquire\nknowledge thus takes the form of a concern with how we might acquire\ncognitive language. But his interest here is in epistemology, rather\nthan in language for its own sake: \u201cI am interested in the flow\nof evidence from the triggering of the senses to the pronouncements of\nscience\u2026. It is these epistemological concerns, and not my\nincidental interest in linguistics, that motivate my\nspeculations.\u201d (1990b, 3).\n\nMuch of Quine\u2019s work in epistemology is thus a discussion of how\na child might acquire cognitive language. This genetic project may\nseem to be a long way from the traditional concerns of epistemology.\nQuine claims, however, that the project in fact affords us the best\nobtainable insight into the nature of the evidence for our theories,\nand into the relation between theory and evidence: \u201cthe\nevidential relation is virtually enacted, it would seem, in the\nlearning.\u201d (1975b, 74\u201375).\n",
