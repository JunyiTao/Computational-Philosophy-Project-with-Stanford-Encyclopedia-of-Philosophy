Some (Cartwright 1999; Hacking 1983) have suggested a picture\nof science according to which there are no systematic relations that\nhold between different models. Some models are tied together because\nthey represent the same target system, but this does not imply that\nthey enter into any further relationships (deductive or otherwise). We\nare confronted with a patchwork of models, all of which hold\nceteris paribus in their specific domains of\napplicability.\n\nSome argue that this picture is at least partially incorrect because\nthere are various interesting relations that hold between different\nmodels or theories. These relations range from thoroughgoing reductive\nrelations (Scheibe 1997, 1999, 2001: esp. Chs. V.23 and V.24) and\ncontrolled approximations over singular limit relations (Batterman\n2001 [2016]) to structural relations (G\u00e4hde 1997) and rather\nloose relations called \u201cstories\u201d (Hartmann 1999; see also\nBokulich 2003; Teller 2002; and the essays collected in Part\u00a0III of\nHartmann et al. 2008). These suggestions have been made on the basis\nof case studies, and it remains to be seen whether a more general\naccount of these relations can be given and whether a deeper\njustification for them can be provided, for instance, within a\nBayesian framework (first steps towards a Bayesian understanding of\nreductive relations can be found in Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2011;\nLiefke and Hartmann 2018; and Te\u0161i\u0107 2019).\n\nModels also figure in the debate about reduction and emergence in\nphysics. Here, some authors argue that the modern approach to\nrenormalization challenges Nagel\u2019s (1961) model of reduction or\nthe broader doctrine of reductions (for a critical discussion, see,\nfor instance, Batterman 2002, 2010, 2011; Morrison 2012; and Saatsi and Reutlinger 2018).\nDizadji-Bahmani et al. (2010) provide a defense of the Nagel\u2013Schaffner\nmodel of reduction, and Butterfield (2011a,b, 2014) argues that\nrenormalization is consistent with Nagelian reduction. Palacios (2019)\nshows that phase transitions are compatible with reductionism, and\nHartmann (2001) argues that the effective-field-theories research\nprogram is consistent with reductionism (see also Bain 2013 and\nFranklin forthcoming). Rosaler (2015) argues for a \u201clocal\u201d\nform of reduction which sees the fundamental relation of reduction\nholding between models, not theories, which is, however, compatible\nwith the Nagel\u2013Schaffner model of reduction. See also the entries on\n intertheory relations in physics\n and\n scientific reduction.\n\nIn the social sciences, agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly\nused (Klein et al. 2018). These models show how surprisingly complex\nbehavioral patterns at the macro-scale can emerge from a small number\nof simple behavioral rules for the individual agents and their\ninteractions. This raises questions similar to the questions mentioned\nabove about reduction and emergence in physics, but so far one only\nfinds scattered remarks about reduction in the literature. See\nWeisberg and Muldoon (2009) and Zollman (2007) for the application of\nABMs to the epistemology and the social structure of science, and\nColyvan (2013) for a discussion of methodological questions raised by\nnormative models in general.\n",
