    "main_text": "The Human Being as Part of Nature || The Argument to the Striving Doctrine\n1.1 The Argument to the Striving Doctrine\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s argument to IIIp6 is uncharacteristically insulated from the\nrest of the Ethics. As Spinoza presents the argument at\nIIIp6d, it depends principally upon IIIp4, a proposition which Spinoza\ntakes to be self-evident, and IIIp5 which derives from IIIp4 alone. The\nargument also involves, less directly, IP25C and its gloss at IP34. \nI Proposition 25 Corollary: Particular things are nothing\nbut affections of God\u2019s attributes, or modes by which God\u2019s attributes are expressed in a certain and determinate way. \n\n\n\nI Proposition 34: God\u2019s power is his essence itself.\n\n\nIII Proposition 4: No thing can be destroyed except through an\nexternal cause.\n\n\nIII Proposition 5: Things are of a contrary nature, i.e., cannot be\nin the same subject, insofar as one can destroy the other.\n\n\nTherefore, III Proposition 6: Each thing, as far as it can by its own\npower, strives to persevere in its being.\n\n\n\nA thing\u2019s essence may not be absolutely equivalent to its nature for\nSpinoza, since a thing such as a square circle has a nature but cannot\nexist (Ip11) and one might interpret Spinoza as holding that anything\nwhich has an essence might exist (IId2). Still, the two terms might be\ntaken interchangeably here because Spinoza is only describing\nexistents. If this assumption is correct, then perhaps Spinoza\u2019s\nreasoning runs like this:\nParticular things are expressions of power,\nsince they are modes of God\u2019s attributes (Ip25) and God\u2019s attributes\nconstitute God\u2019s essence (ID4) and God\u2019s essence is his power (Ip34).\nIt is self-evident that nothing can be destroyed except through an\nexternal cause (IIIp4), so an apparent particular thing which is\nself-destructive is in fact at least two (IIIp5). The power a genuine\nparticular thing expresses, then, must therefore be directed toward its\nown perseverance in being (IIIp6).\n\nPace Spinoza, the claim at IIIp4 that no thing can be\ndestroyed except through an external cause is not clearly self-evident.\nEven assuming IIIp4 to be true, however, one might raise questions\nabout Spinoza\u2019s argument. Why is it that, just because a thing does not\nstrive to destroy itself, that thing must therefore strive to persevere\nin being? A thing might, it seems, not strive for anything, or perhaps it\nmight strive to do something which is neither perseverance nor\nself-destruction. Spinoza\u2019s use of IP34 and Ip25c seems intended to\nrule out the first of these possibilities. Although Spinoza\u2019s term\n\u2018express\u2019 (exprimere) is notoriously unclear, it\nmay mean something like \u201cis a particular form of.\u201d In that case,\nbecause particular things are expressions of God\u2019s essence, his power,\nthey must be particular forms of power. So there cannot be a thing\nwhich does not strive at all or, in other words, there cannot be a\nthing which is not any expression of power at all.\n\n\nThe second version of the objection, the version which notes the\npossibility that a particular thing as described in IIIp4 might strive\nfor something other than either self-destruction or perseverance,\nremains a challenge to sympathetic readers of the Ethics\nhowever. The rejection of IIIp6 and an insistence that at least some\nthing does not strive to persevere in its being, where perseverance in\nbeing is understood as a particular end among many possible options,\nis perfectly consistent with the truth of IIIp4. After all, not\nstriving to persevere in being, which IIIp6 rules out, is not the same\nthing as striving not to persevere in being, which IIIp4 rules out. A\nsympathetic reader of Spinoza might try to resolve the difficulty\nthrough an understanding of what it means to strive to persevere in\nbeing, under which striving to persevere in being comes to mean just\nthe same thing as striving to do something other than destroy oneself,\nin particular, striving to maintain a present state. (See Curley 1,\n109, for an interpretation similar to this one.) This reading comes\ncloser to making the argument from IIIp4 to IIIp6 seem valid, but it\nraises a new problem: that of reconciling this interpretation of\nstriving with Spinoza\u2019s accounts of human motivation which follow from\nIIIp6. For Spinoza consistently regards sane human beings as finite\nmodes who, beyond merely not trying to kill themselves, actively try\nto preserve themselves. People do not merely resist changes to\nwhatever state they are in; they strive to change their states in\norder to know more and in order to live with a greater force. One of\nthe main problems Spinoza faces, then, is reconciling the most\nplausible version of IIIp6 as an account of the natures of ordinary\nobjects (under which IIIp6 is a principle of inertia) with the most\nplausible version of IIIp6 as an account of human nature (under which\nIIIp6 is a version of psychological egoism).\n",
