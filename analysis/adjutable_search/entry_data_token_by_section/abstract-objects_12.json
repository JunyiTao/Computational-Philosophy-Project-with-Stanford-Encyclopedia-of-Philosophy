In this section we consider the idea that the\nabstract/concrete distinction might be defined by saying that\nabstract objects exist in some less robust sense than the sense in\nwhich concrete objects exist.\n\nThe traditional platonist conception is a realist one: abstract\nobjects exist in just the same full-blooded sense that objects in the\nnatural world exist\u2014they are mind-independent, rather than\nartifacts of human endeavor or dependent on concrete objects in any\nway. But a number of deflationary, metatontological views, now\nestablished in the literature, are based on the idea that the problems\ntraditional platonists face have to do with \u201csome very general\npreconceptions about what it takes to specify an object\u201d rather than\nwith \u201cthe abstractness of the desired object\u201d (Linnebo 2018,\n42). These views suggest that abstract objects exist in some weaker\nsense. Various approaches therefore articulate what may be called the\nways of weakening existence. One clear precedent is due to Carnap 1950\n[1956], whose deflationary approach may go the furthest; Carnap\nrejects the metaphysical pursuit of what \u201creally exists\u201d\n(even in the case of concrete objects) since he maintains that the\nquestion \u201cDo \\(X\\text{s}\\) really exist?\u201d are\npseudo-questions (if asked independently of some linguistic\nframework).\n\nBut there are other ways to suggest that abstract objects have\nexistence conditions that demand little of the world. For example,\nLinsky & Zalta (1995, 532) argued that the mind-independence\nand objectivity of abstract objects isn\u2019t like that of physical\nobjects: abstract objects aren\u2019t subject to an\nappearance/reality distinction, they don\u2019t exist in a\n\u2018sparse\u2019 way that requires discovery by empirical\ninvestigation, and they aren\u2019t complete objects (e.g.,\nmathematical objects are defined only by their mathematical\nproperties). They use this conception to naturalize\nZalta\u2019s comprehension principle for abstract objects.\n\nOther deflationary accounts develop some weaker sense in which\nabstract objects exist (e.g., as \u2018thin\u2019 objects). We\nfurther describe some of these proposals below and try to unpack the\nways in which they characterize the weakened, deflationary sense of\nexistence (even when such characterizations are not always\nexplicit).\n3.7.1 The Criterion of Linguistic Rules\n\nCarnap held that claims about the \u201creal\u201d existence of\nentities (concrete or abstract) do not have cognitive content. They\nare pseudo-statements. However, he admitted: (a) that there are\nsentences in science that use terms that designate mathematical\nentities (such as numbers); and (b) that semantic analysis seems to\nrequire entities like properties and propositions. Since mathematical\nentities, properties, and propositions are traditionally considered\nabstract, he wanted to clarify how it is possible to accept a language\nreferring to abstract entities without adopting what he considered\npseudo-sentences about such entities\u2019 objective reality.\nCarnap\u2019s famous paper (1950 [1956]) contained an attempt to show\nthat, without embracing Platonism, one can use a language referring to\nabstract entities.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Carnap begins by noting that before one can\nask existence questions about entities of a determinate kind, one\nfirst has to have a language, or a linguistic framework, that\nallows one to speak about the kinds of entity in question. He then\ndistinguishes \u2018internal\u2019 existence questions expressed\nwithin such a linguistic framework from \u2018external\u2019\nexistence questions about a framework. Only the latter ask whether the\nentities of that framework are objectively real. As we\u2019ll see\nbelow, Carnap thought that internal existence questions within a\nframework can be answered, either by empirical investigation or by\nlogical analysis, depending on the kind of entity the framework is\nabout. By contrast, Carnap regards external questions (e.g., \u2018Do\n\\(X\\text{s}\\) exist?\u2019, expressed either about, or independent\nof, a linguistic framework) as pseudo-questions: though they appear to\nbe theoretical questions, in fact they are merely practical questions\nabout the utility of the linguistic framework for science.\n\nCarnap\u2019s paper (1950 [1956]) considers a variety of linguistic\nframeworks, such as those for: observable things (i.e., the\nspatiotemporally ordered system of observable things and events),\nnatural numbers and integers, propositions, thing properties, rational\nand real numbers, and spatiotemporal coordinate systems. Each\nframework is established by developing a language that typically\nincludes expressions for one or more kinds of entities in question,\nexpressions for properties of the entities in question (including a\ngeneral category term for each kind of entity in question), and\nvariables ranging over those entities. Thus, a framework for the\nsystem of observable things has expressions that denote such things\n(\u2018the Earth\u2019, \u2018the Eiffel Tower\u2019, etc.),\nexpressions for properties of such things (\u2018planet\u2019,\n\u2018made of metal\u2019, etc.), and variables ranging over\nobservables. The framework for natural numbers has expressions that\ndenote them (\u20180\u2019, \u20182+5\u2019), expressions for\nproperties of the numbers (\u2018prime\u2019, \u2018odd\u2019),\nincluding the general category term \u2018number\u2019), and\nvariables ranging over numbers.\n\nFor Carnap, each statement in a linguistic framework should have a\ntruth value that can be determined either by analytical or empirical\nmethods. A statement\u2019s truth value is analytically determinable\nif it is logically true (or false), or if it\u2019s truth is\ndeterminable exclusively from the rules of the language or on the\nbasis of semantic relationships among its component expressions. A\nstatement is empirically determinable when it is confirmable (or\ndisconfirmable) in the light of the perceived evidence. Note that the\nvery attempt to confirm an empirical statement about physical objects\non the basis of the evidence requires that one adopt the language of\nthe framework of things. Carnap warns us, however, that \u201cthis\nmust not be interpreted as if it meant \u2026 acceptance of a\nbelief in the reality of the thing world; there is no such\nbelief or assertion or assumption because it is not a theoretical\nquestion\u201d (1950 [1956, 208]). For Carnap, to accept an ontology\n\u201cmeans nothing more than to accept a certain form of language,\nin other words to accept rules for forming statements and for testing,\naccepting, or rejecting them\u201d (1950 [1956, 208]).\n\nCarnap takes this approach to every linguistic framework, no matter\nwhether it is a framework about physical, concrete things, or a\nframework about abstract entities such as numbers, properties,\nconcepts, propositions, etc. For him, the pragmatic reasons for\naccepting a given linguistic framework are that it has explanatory\npower, unifies the explanation of disparate kinds of data and\nphenomena, expresses claims more efficiently, etc. And we often choose\na framework for a particular explanatory purpose. We might therefore\nchoose a framework with expressions about abstract entities to carry\nout an explication (i.e., an elucidation of concepts), or to\ndevelop a semantics for natural language. For Carnap, the choice\nbetween platonism or nominalism is not a legitimate one; both are\ninappropriate attempts to answer an external pseudo-question.\n\nAs sketched earlier, the truth of such existence claims as\n\u2018there are tables\u2019 and \u2018there are unicorns\u2019,\nwhich are expressed within the framework for observable entities, is\nto be determined empirically, since empirical observations and\ninvestigations are needed. These statements are not true in virtue of\nthe rules of the language. By contrast, existence claims such as\n\u2018there are numbers\u2019 (\u2018\\(\\exists xNx\\)\u2019)\nexpressed within the framework of number theory, or \u2018there is a\nproperty \\(F\\) such that both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(F\\)\u2019\n(\u2018\\(\\exists F(Fx \\:\\&\\:\nFy)\\)\u2019) expressed within the framework of property\ntheory, can be determined analytically. For these statements either\nform part of the rules of the language (e.g., expressed as axioms that\ngovern the terms of the language) or are derivable from the rules of\nthe language. When these statements are part of the rules that make up\nthe linguistic framework, they are considered analytic, as\nare the existential statements that follow from those\nrules.[14]\n\n\nAll of the existence assertions just discussed are therefore\ninternal to their respective linguistic frameworks. Carnap\nthinks that the only sense that can be given to talk of\n\u201cexistence\u201d is an internal sense. Internal questions about\nthe existence of things or abstract objects are not questions about\ntheir real metaphysical\n existence.[15]\n Hence, it seems more appropriate to describe his view as embodying a\ndeflationary notion of object. For Carnap concludes \u201cthe\nquestion of the admissibility of entities of a certain type or of\nabstract entities in general as designata is reduced to the question\nof the acceptability of the linguistic framework for those\nentities\u201d (1950 [1956, 217]).\n\nThus, for each framework (no matter whether it describes empirical\nobjects, abstract objects, or a mix of both), one can formulate both\nsimple and complex existential statements. According to Carnap, each\nsimple existential statement is either empirical or analytic. If a\nsimple statement is empirical, its truth value can be determined by a\ncombination of empirical inquiry and consideration of the linguistic\nrules governing the framework; if the simple existential statement is\nanalytic, then its truth value can be determined simply by considering\nthe linguistic rules governing the framework. Whereas the simple\nexistential statements that require empirical investigation assert the\nexistence of possible concrete entities (like \u2018tables\u2019\nor \u2018unicorns\u2019), the simple existential statements that are\nanalytic assert the existence of abstract entities. Let us call this\ncriterion for asserting the existence of abstract objects the\ncriterion of linguistic rules.\n\nThe case of mixed frameworks poses some difficulties for the view.\nAccording to the Criterion of Linguistic Rules,\n\n\\(x\\) is abstract iff \u201c\\(x\\) exists\u201d is analytic in the\nrelevant language.\n\nBut this criterion suggests that impure sets,\nobject-dependent properties, abstract artifacts, and the rest are not\nabstract. For this criterion appears to draw a line between certain\npure abstract entities and everything else. The truth of simple\nexistence statements about \\(\\{\\textrm{Bob Dylan}\\}\\) or\nDickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol, which usually are\nconsidered abstract entities, does not depend solely on linguistic\nrules. The same goes for simple and complex existential statements\nwith general terms such as \u2018novel\u2019, \u2018legal\nstatute\u2019, etc.\n\nIn the end, though, Carnap doesn\u2019t seem to be either a realist\nor nominalist about objects (abstract or concrete). Carnap rejects the\nquestion whether these objects are real in a metaphysical sense. But,\ncontrary to the nominalist, he rejects the idea that we can truly deny\nthe real existence of abstract objects (i.e., a denial that is\nexternal to a linguistic framework). This attitude, which settles the\nquestion of which framework to adopt on pragmatic grounds (e.g., which\nframework best helps us to make sense of the data to be explained), is\nthe reason why we\u2019ve labeled his view as a way of weakening\nexistence. See the entry on\n Carnap\n for further details.\n\nProposals by other philosophers are related to Carnap\u2019s view.\nResnik (1997, Part Two) has put forward a postulational\nepistemology for the existence of mathematical objects. According\nto this view, all one has to do to ensure the existence of\nmathematical objects is to use a language to posit mathematical\nobjects and to establish a consistent mathematical theory for\n them.[16]\n Nevertheless, their existence does not result from their being\nposited. Instead, we recognize those objects as existent because a\nconsistent mathematical theory for them has been developed. Resnik\nrequires both a linguistic stipulation for considering mathematical\nobjects and a coherency condition for recognizing them as existent.\nThomasson (2015, 30\u201334) advocates for an approach which she\ntakes to be inherited from Carnap. She calls it easy\nontology. Since she is not trying to find ultimate categories or\na definitive list of basic (abstract or concrete) objects, she prefers\na simpler kind of realism (see Thomasson 2015, 145\u2013158). She\nargues that everyday uses of existential statements provide acceptable\nontological commitments when those assertions are supported either by\nempirical evidence or merely by the rules of use that govern general\nterms (e.g., sortal terms); in both cases she says that\n\u201capplication conditions\u201d for a general term are fulfilled\n(see Thomasson 2015, 86, 89\u201395). She, too, therefore offers a\ncriterion of linguistic rules for accepting abstract objects.\nGiven her defense of simple realism, it appears that she takes both\nobservable objects and theoretical entities in science as\nconcrete.\n3.7.2 The Criterion of Minimalism\n\nIn what follows, two ways of formulating criteria for the\nabstract/concrete distinction are considered. The views start with the\nidea that our concept of an object allows for objects whose existence\nplaces very few demands on reality over and above the demands imposed\nby claims that do not mention abstract objects. Those philosophers who\nmaintain this philosophical thesis are what Linnebo (2012) calls\nmetaontological minimalists. Their proposals are typically\nput forward in connection with issues in the philosophy of\nmathematics, but then applied to other domains.\n\nParsons (1990), Resnik (1997), and Shapiro (1997) contend that, in the\ncase of mathematical theories, coherence suffices for the existence of\nthe objects mentioned in those\n theories.[17]\n They do not offer an explicit criterion for distinguishing abstract\nand concrete objects. Nevertheless, their proposals implicitly draw\nthe distinction; abstract objects are those objects that exist in\nvirtue of the truth of certain modal claims. In particular, the\nexistence of mathematical objects is \u201cgrounded in\u201d pure\nmodal truths. For example, numbers exist \u201cin virtue of\u201d\nthe fact that there could have been an \\(\\omega\\)-sequence of objects;\nsets exist because there might be entities that satisfy the axioms of\none or another set theory, etc. Since these pure modal truths are\nnecessary, this explains why pure abstract objects exist necessarily.\nIt also explains a sense in which they are insubstantial: their\nexistence is grounded in truths that do not (on the face of it)\nrequire the actual existence of anything at\n all.[18]\n\n\nLinnebo (2018) advances a proposal about how to conceive abstract\nobjects by revising our understanding of Fregean biconditional\nprinciples of abstraction (see\n subsection\u00a03.4).\n Some philosophers take these Fregean abstraction principles to be\nanalytic sentences. For example, Hale & Wright (2001; 2009)\nconsider the two sides of an abstraction principle as equivalent as a\nmatter of meaning; they \u2018carve up content\u2019 in different\nways (to use Frege\u2019s metaphor). But Linnebo (2018, 13\u201314)\nrejects this view and the view that such biconditional principles are\nanalytic.\n\nHe suggests instead that we achieve reference to abstract (and other\nobjects) by means of a sufficiency operator, \\(\\Rightarrow\\),\nwhich he takes to be a strengthening of the material conditional. He\nstarts with conditional principles of the form \u201cif\n\\(Rab\\), then \\(f(a) \\! =\\! f(b)\\)\u201d (e.g., \u201cif \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are parallel, then the direction of \\(a\\) = the direction of\n\\(b\\)\u201d) and takes the right-hand side to be reconceptualization\nof the left-hand side. He represents these claims as \\(\\phi\n\\Rightarrow \\psi\\), where the new operator\n\u2018\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\u2019 is meant to capture the intuitive idea\nthat \\(\\phi\\) is (conceptually) sufficient\nfor \\(\\psi\\), or all that is required for\n\\(\\psi\\) is \\(\\phi\\). For \\(\\phi\\) to be sufficient for\n\\(\\psi\\), sufficiency must be stronger than\nmetaphysically implies but weaker than analytically\nimplies (see Linnebo 2018, 15). The notion Linnebo considers is a\n\u2018species of metaphysical grounding\u2019. Hence, sufficiency\nstatements allow us to conceptualize statements mentioning abstract\nobjects (or other problematic objects) in terms of metaphysically less\nproblematic or non-problematic objects.\n\nIt is important for Linnebo that sufficiency be asymmetric. He\nwouldn\u2019t accept mutual sufficiency, i.e., principles of the form\n\\(Rab \\Leftrightarrow f(a) \\! =\\! f(b)\\), since these would imply that\nboth sides are equivalent as a matter of meaning. Instead, the point\nis that the seemingly unproblematic claim \\(Rab\\) renders the claim\n\\(f(a) \\! =\\! f(b)\\) unproblematic, and this is best expressed by\nsufficiency statements of the form \\(Rab \\Rightarrow f(a) \\! =\\!\nf(b)\\), on which the left side grounds the right side. So\nLinnebo\u2019s notion of reconceptualization is not the Fregean\nnotion of recarving of content.\n\nMoreover, in a sufficiency statement, Linnebo doesn\u2019t require\nthat the relation \\(R\\) be an equivalence relation; he requires only\nthat \\(R\\) be symmetric and transitive. It need not be reflexive, for\nthe domain might contain entities \\(x\\) such that \\(\\neg Rxx\\) (e.g.,\nin the case of the sufficiency statement for directions, not every\nobject \\(x\\) in the domain is such that \\(x\\) is parallel with\n\\(x\\)\u2014being parallel is restricted to lines). Linnebo calls such\nsymmetric and transitive relations unity relations. When a\nsufficiency statement\u2014\\(Rab \\Rightarrow f(a) \\! =\\!\nf(b)\\)\u2014holds, then new objects are identified. The new objects\nare specified in terms of the less problematic entities related by\n\\(R\\); for example, directions become specified by lines that are\nparallel. According to Linnebo, the parallel lines become\nspecifications of the new objects. A unity relation \\(R\\) is\ntherefore the starting point for developing a sufficient (but not\nnecessary and sufficient) condition for reference.\n\nSometimes the new objects introduced by conditional principles do not\nmake demands on reality; when that happens, they are said to be\nthin (for example, directions only require that there be\nparallel lines). However, when the new objects introduced by\nsufficiency statements make more substantial demands on reality, the\nobjects are considered thick. Suppose \\(Rab\\) asserts \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\) are spatiotemporal parts of the same cohesive and naturally\nbounded whole. Then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) become specifications for physical\nbodies via the following principle: \\(Rab \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{Body}(a)\n\\! =\\! \\mathrm{Body}(b)\\). In this case, the principle \u201cmakes a\nsubstantial demand on the world\u201d because it requires checking\nthat there are spatiotemporal parts constituting a continuous\nstretch of solid stuff (just looking at the spatiotemporal parts\ndoes not suffice to determine whether they constitute to a body; see\nLinnebo 2018, 45).\n\nHowever, Linnebo does not identify being abstract with being thin\n(2012, 147), for there are thin objects in a relative sense that are\nnot abstract, namely those that make no substantial demands on the\nworld beyond those introduced in terms of some antecedently given\nobjects. The mereological sum of your left hand and your laptop makes\nno demand on the world beyond the demands of its\n parts.[19]\n Instead, he suggests that abstract objects are those that are thin\nand that have a shallow nature. The notion of shallow\nnature is meant to capture \u201cthe intuitive idea that any\nquestion that is solely about \\(F\\text{s}\\) has an answer that can be\ndetermined on the basis of any given specifications of these\n\\(F\\text{s}\\)\u201d (2018, 192\u2013195). For example, directions\nhave a shallow nature because any question about directions (e.g., are\nthey orthogonal, etc.?) can be determined solely on the basis of the\nlines that specify them. Shapes have a shallow nature because any\nquestion about them (e.g., are they triangular, circular, etc.?) can\nbe determined solely on the basis of their underlying concrete\nfigures. By contrast, mereological sums of concrete objects are\nnot shallow because there are questions about them that\ncannot be answered solely on the basis of their specifications; for\ninstance, the weight of the mereological sum of your laptop and your\nleft hand depends not only on their combination but also on the\ngravitational field in which they are\n located.[20]\n\n\nLinnebo thus contrasts abstract objects, which are thin and have a\nshallow nature, with concrete objects, which do not have a shallow\nnature. Linnebo extends this view in several ways. He constructs an\naccount of mathematical objects that goes beyond the way of\nabstraction principles by providing a reconstruction of set\ntheory in terms of \u2018dynamic abstraction\u2019 (2018,\nch.\u00a03). This form of minimalism also allows for abstract objects\nof a mixed nature; namely, those that are thin relative to\nother objects. For example, the type of the letter \u2018A\u2019 is\nabstract because it is thin and has a shallow nature, but it is thin\nwith respect the tokens of the letter \u2018A\u2019.\n\nThis view, as Linnebo himself admits, faces some problems. One of them\nis that the methodologies used by working mathematicians, such as\nclassical logic, impredicative definitions, and taking arbitrary\nsubcollections of infinite domains, seem to presuppose objects that\nare more independent, i.e., objects that don\u2019t have a shallow\nnature (2018, 197; for a discussion of independence, see \nSection 4.1 of the entry on\n platonism in mathematics). \nAnother problem (2018, 195) is that\nin order for an object to count as having a shallow nature,\nan intrinsic unity relation has to be available. An\ninvestigation is required to establish that there is such an intrinsic\nunity relation in each case. It is far from clear that a conditional\nprinciple with an intrinsic unity relation is available for\neach of problematic cases mentioned in this entry, such as chess,\nlegal institutions or the English language. Finally, Linnebo\ndoesn\u2019t discuss the question of whether sets of concrete\nurelements are themselves abstract or concrete. At present, there may\nbe an important question left open by his theory that other theories\nof abstract objects answer.\n",
