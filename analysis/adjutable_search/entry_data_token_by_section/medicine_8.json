Clinician Judgement and the Role of Expertise\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 5,\n hierarchies of evidence in evidence-based medicine rank study results\nfrom \u201csystematic\u201d clinical research such as RCTs and\nobservational studies higher than \u201cunsystematic\u201d expert\nopinion. The epidemiologists who initiated the formal EBM movement in\nthe early 1990s had good reason to be skeptical about expert opinion.\nWhen therapies are subjected to systematic tests, tradition and expert\nopinion are sometimes shown to be flawed. John Worrall discusses three\nexamples: grommets for glue ear, ventricular ectopic beats repressing\nsubstances such as encainide or flecainide for cardiac arrest, and\nroutine fetal heart rate monitoring to prevent infant death (Worrall\n2007a: 985). In each case we have a procedure the effectiveness of which is\nindicated by common sense and knowledge about the patho-physiological\npathways\u2014glue ear is a condition produced by a build-up of fluid\nin the middle ear that is unable to drain away because of pressure\ndifferentials, grommets act by letting air into the middle ear and\nthereby equalizing pressure, for instance\u2014but which, when tested\nby a randomized trial, turns out to be ineffective at best and\npositively harmful in the worst case.\n\nMisjudgments concerning the efficacy of therapies for purely epistemic\nreasons are not the only worry that one might have about expert\nopinion. Medical experts and patients are in what economists call a\nprincipal-agent relationship. The principal\u2014in this case, the\npatient\u2014desires the delivery of a certain good or\nservice\u2014in this case, his health. He instructs an agent\u2014in\nthis case, the doctor\u2014with it, because he lacks the expertise to\nproduce the good himself. The good can only be produced with\nuncertainty: no therapy is 100% effective. Moreover, the success at\ndelivering the good depends in part on the agent\u2019s effort. The\ndoctor may not always choose the optimal therapy for a patient (we can\nsuppose that it takes some effort to select the optimal therapy for a\npatient), and any therapy can be implemented sloppily. Moreover,\nlacking expertise, the patient cannot observe the level of effort a\ndoctor puts in. He therefore cannot design a contract that makes\npayments dependent on level of effort (much less on success, as\nsuccess is in part influenced by factors outside of either\nparty\u2019s control). Agents therefore have an incentive to cheat:\nnot to put in the level of effort required to select and deliver the\noptimal therapy from a patient\u2019s point of view.\n\nIf patients and doctors were perfectly rational and motivated only by\ntheir own material welfare, and in the absence of regulation, there\nsimply wouldn\u2019t be a market for health services. Doctors would\nchoose therapies that are best for them and not for patients, and\npatients would anticipate this behavior and stop seeking\ndoctor\u2019s services in the first place. In our world, neither\npatients nor doctors are particularly rational, nor are they motivated\npurely by self-interest, there are ethical codes such as the modern\nform of the Hippocratic Oath, and the health sector is one of the most\nregulated industries of all. All this does not, however, change the\nincentive structure in which doctors and other providers of health\nservices operate. Because they and not the patients are experts, they\nhave incentives to choose therapies that are in their best interests\nand not in the patients\u2019 interests.\n\nThere is a further complication. Many, probably most, doctors have\nconnections to the pharmaceutical industry in one form or another.\nAccording to one study, 94% of U.S. physicians receive financial\nbenefits from the pharmaceutical industry (Bekelman et al. 2003). Even\nif we suppose that doctors do not prescribe a therapy because they are\npaid to do so, marketing efforts directed at them will influence\ntreatment recommendations, if only because they know certain pills\nbetter than others, or because some treatments are at the top of their\nheads.\n\nFor all these reasons, the EBM principle that treatment decisions\nshould be based on the best available evidence from systematic\nresearch does not come out of nowhere. If, say, there is an RCT or an\nobservational study that reports that treatment X is more\neffective at relieving symptoms S than treatment Y,\nit would seem bad to recommend a patient who suffers from S\nto take Y because his GP doesn\u2019t know about X,\ndoesn\u2019t know the study result, personally profits from\nprescribing Y or is inattentive. However, while these are all\nbad reasons to recommend Y over X in the light of\nthe study result, there may be a variety of good reasons.\n\nAs discussed in\n Section 5,\n RCTs and many observational studies are population-level studies,\nwhich produce average results that are not straightforwardly\napplicable to individuals. If, say, treatment X reduces the\nrisk of suffering from some adverse event over a period of time by 50%\nin population p, that is, the risk ratio (RR) for this\ntreatment is 50%, then there may be no individual in p for\nwhom the treatment halves the risk. Instead, the RR may vary\ndramatically among the subpopulations of p, and it may well\nbe the case that Y is more effective than X for some\nsubpopulations.\n\nThe same is true of side effects. Tonelli (2006) discusses a case\nwhere a patient who suffers from multiple sclerosis receives a\ntreatment that does seem to alleviate her symptoms, but since she has\nstarted taking it, she has been plagued by severe episodes of\ndepression. Clinical trial results indicate that the drug is effective\nin treating multiple sclerosis, and no adverse psychiatric effects\nhave been reported. Her GP and her psychiatrist now debate whether to\ncontinue the treatment. There are various reasons why the clinical\nstudies do not show evidence of mental health effects: the trial\nsubjects weren\u2019t properly screened for depression; adverse\neffects were found but not reported; the adverse effects were not\nstatistically significant\u2014but they may have been clinically\nsignificant for some subpopulations; the side effects only obtain in\npopulations that differ from the trial populations.\n\nThis case shows that a treatment\u2019s effectiveness in relieving\nthe symptoms of the disease for which it was prescribed is not the\nonly consideration when making a treatment decision. The goal of the\ntreatment is to improve the patient\u2019s wellbeing, which is well\nrecognized by the proponents of EBM. A patient\u2019s wellbeing has\nmany components, of course, and the symptoms of any given disease are\nat best one element in its determination. This is another reason why\nclinical judgment must be exercised in the derivation of a treatment\nrecommendation.\n\nUnfortunately, experts\u2014like all humans\u2014are notoriously bad\ndecision makers. Cognitive psychologists have established a large\nnumber of cognitive biases to which human experts are subject: they\nsuffer from overconfidence (e.g., Dawes and Mulford 1996) and\nhindsight bias (e.g., Fischhoff 1975; Hugh and Dekker 2009); are\nregularly outperformed by simple mechanical algorithms (e.g., Grove\nand Meehl 1996); commit the conjunction fallacy (Tversky and Kahneman\n1983; Rao 2009), and many others.\n\nTo give an example for a simple mechanical algorithm outperforming\nexperts, consider the Goldberg Rule, according to which a patient is\nto be qualified as neurotic if \\(x = (\\textrm{L} + \\textrm{Pa}+\n\\textrm{Sc}) - (\\textrm{Hy} + \\textrm{Pt}) > 45\\) (where L is a\nvalidity scale and Pa, Sc, Hy, and Pt are clinical scales of a\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory or MMPI test) and as\npsychotic otherwise. Lewis Goldberg tested the rule on a set of MMPI\nprofiles from 861 patients who had been diagnosed by the psychiatric\nstaff in their hospital or clinic and found it to be 70% accurate;\nclinicians\u2019 accuracy ranged from 55% to 67% (Goldberg 1968; for\na discussion, see Bishop and Trout 2005).\n\nThere is no one strategy to deal with the various biases and interests\nthat affect clinicians\u2019 judgments. Better numeracy and\nstatistical training at universities can help to eliminate some\ncognitive biases (Gigerenzer 2014). Computer-aided medical diagnosis and decision making\nmay alleviate others. No training or computer program can make\nnormative judgments, however, and neither will help with adverse\nincentive structures and financial interests. These difficulties also\nbeset committees of medical experts to which we are turning\nnext.\n",
