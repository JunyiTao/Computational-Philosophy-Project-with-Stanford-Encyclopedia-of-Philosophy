    "main_text": "Special Topics in the Study of Animal Consciousness || Animal pain and suffering\n7.1 Animal pain and suffering\nGiven the centrality of pain to most accounts of our ethical\nobligations towards animals, as well as the importance of animal\nmodels of pain in clinical medical research (see Mogil 2009 for a\nreview), it is hardly surprising that there is a substantial (albeit\ncontroversial) scientific literature bearing on animal pain. Reports\nby the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the U.K. (Nuffield Council\n2005; see esp. chapter 4) and the U.S. National Academy of the\nSciences Institute for Animal Laboratory Research (ILAR 2009) have\nrecently covered the definition of pain and the physiological,\nneurological, and behavioral evidence for pain in nonhuman\nanimals. These reviews also distinguish pain from distress and\nsuffering (see also Bermond 2001), and the ILAR has divided what used\nto be a single report on recognition and alleviation of pain and\ndistress into two separate reports, although the scientific\ninvestigation of distress is relatively rudimentary (but see Dawkins\n1985; Farah 2008). \nA proper understanding of neurological studies of animal pain\nbegins with the distinction between nociception and pain. Nociception\n\u2014 the capacity to sense noxious stimuli \u2014 is one of the\nmost primitive sensory capacities. Neurons functionally specialized\nfor nociception have been described in invertebrates such as the\nmedical leech and the marine snail Aplysia californica\n(Walters 1996). Because nociceptors are found in a very wide range of\nspecies, and are functionally effective even in decerebrate or\nspinally transected animals, their presence and activity\nin a species provides little or no direct evidence for phenomenally\nconscious pain experiences. The gate control theory of Melzack and\nWall (1965) describes a mechanism by which \u201ctop-down\u201d\nsignals from the brain modulate \u201cbottom-up\u201d nociception,\nproviding space for the distinction between felt pain and\nnociception.\n Smith & Boyd (1991) assess the evidence for the pain-sensing\ncapabilities of animals in the categories of whether nociceptors are\nconnected to the central nervous system, whether endogenous opioids\nare present, whether analgesics affect responses, and whether the\nensuing behavioral responses are analogous to those of humans (see\ntable 2.3 in Varner 1998, p. 53, which updates the one presented by\nSmith & Boyd).  On the basis of these criteria, Varner follows\nSmith & Boyd in concluding tentatively that the most obvious place\nto draw a line between pain-conscious organisms and those not capable\nof feeling pain consciously is between vertebrates and invertebrates.\nHowever, Elwood & Appel (2009) conducted an experiment on hermit\ncrabs which they interpret as providing evidence that pain is\nexperienced and remembered by these crustaceans. Varner also expressed\nsome hesitation about the evidence for conscious pain in\n\u201clower\u201d vertebrates: fish, reptiles and amphibians. Allen\n(2004) argues, however, that subsequent research indicates that the\ndirection of discovery seems uniformly towards identifying more\nsimilarities among diverse species belonging to different taxonomic\nclasses, especially in the domains of anatomy and physiology of the\nnociceptive and pain systems.\nIt is generally accepted that the mammalian pain system has both a\nsensory and an affective pathway, and that these can be dissociated to\nsome degree both pharmacologically (with morphine, e.g.) and surgical\nlesions.  The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a particularly\nimportant structure of the mammalian brain in this regard (Price\n2000).  Allen et al. (2005) and Shriver (2006) argue that\nthis dissociability provides a route to empirical assessment of the\naffective component of animal consciousness, and Farah (2008) uses it\nto distinguish suffering from \u201cmere pain\u201d.\nDetailed analysis of other taxonomic groups may, however, indicate\nimportant anatomical differences. Rose (2002) argues that because fish\nlack an ACC they may not be bothered by pain.  This is in contrast to\nSneddon et al. (2003) who argue that there is adequate\nbehavioral and physiological evidence to support pain attributions to\nfish.  (See, also, Chandroo et al. 2004 for a review.)  While\nthe ACC is important to mammals, there remains the possibility that\nother taxa may have functionally similar structures, such as the\ncorticoidea dorsolateralis in birds (Atoji & Wild 2005;\nDubbeldam 2009). Genetic knockout animals are also providing further\nclues about the affective aspects of pain (see Shriver 2009 for a\nreview and application of these findings to animal welfare.)\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that a major shift in veterinary practice\nin regards to animal pain has occurred in the past decade.  Whereas\nsurgery on animals was once routinely practiced without analgesics or\nanesthetics, the vast majority of veterinary practitioners now accept\nthe basic premise that veterinarians can be trained to recognize\nanimal pain reliably, and that veterinary patients benefit from the\nsame kinds of pain alleviation treatments that are delivered to\nhumans. It has even been argued that animals possess the\nneurobiological mechanisms responsible for phantom limb pain and\nneuropathic pain (pain in the presence of no obvious tissue damage or\ndisease), and that these conditions may therefore be detectable and\ntreatable in nonhuman animals (Mathews 2008).\n\n",
