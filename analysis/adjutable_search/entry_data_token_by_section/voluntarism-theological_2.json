    "main_text": "Metaethical and normative theological voluntarism || Theological voluntarism and moral skepticism\n1.2 Theological voluntarism and moral skepticism\n\nCall a \u2018moral skeptic\u2019 one who disbelieves or withholds\njudgment on the claim that any normative state of affairs obtains. One\ncan affirm metaethical theological voluntarism while being a moral\nskeptic; one cannot affirm normative theological voluntarism while\nbeing a moral skeptic. A metaethical theological voluntarist might\nclaim that no normative state of affairs could be made to obtain\nwithout certain acts of divine will, but because there is no God, or\nbecause there is a God that has not performed the requisite acts of\nwill, no normative states of affairs obtain. A normative theological\nvoluntarist cannot, however, be a moral skeptic. Because the normative\ntheological voluntarist is committed to the obtaining of at least one\nnormative state of affairs\u2014for example, its being obligatory\nto obey God\u2014the conjunction of moral skepticism and\nnormative theological voluntarism is not a coherent combination of\nviews.\n\nMy concern in the rest of this article will be with the metaethical\nversion of theological voluntarism; any further references to\ntheological voluntarism are, unless otherwise noted, to the\nmetaethical version of the position. Theological voluntarism thus\nunderstood is consistent either with the affirmation or with the\ndenial of theism and moral skepticism. Taking a negative stand on\ntheism or a positive stand on moral skepticism should not prevent one\nfrom taking seriously theological voluntarism as a philosophical\nposition. This is an important point, because it is often thought that\ntheological voluntarism is only for theists, or only for moral\nnonskeptics. While it is true that some of the arguments for\ntheological voluntarism take theism, or the existence of moral\nobligations, as premises, not all of them do. \n",
