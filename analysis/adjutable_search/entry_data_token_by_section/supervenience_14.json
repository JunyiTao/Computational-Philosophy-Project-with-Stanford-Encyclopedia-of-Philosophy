This is global supervenience,\ntypically formulated as follows:\n\nA-properties globally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if\nw1 and\nw2 have exactly the same world-wide\npattern of distribution of B-properties, then they have\nexactly the same world-wide pattern of distribution of\nA-properties.\n\n\nThe notion of a global supervenience thesis has been employed for a\nnumber of philosophical purposes. Notably, it has been used to\ncharacterize physicalism (see\n Section 5.4),\n and to capture David Lewis\u2019 Humean supervenience thesis:\n\u201call there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of\nparticular fact\u00c9 all else supervenes on that\u201d (1986a,\nix-x).\n\nGlobal supervenience is often claimed to serve purposes that neither\nstrong nor weak individual supervenience will serve. First, it is\nsometimes claimed that global supervenience naturally handles\nrelational properties like being an original Van Gogh or\nbeing a dollar bill. As we shall see, however, strong or weak\nsupervenience can handle relational properties too. Second, global\nsupervenience naturally handles the supervenience of factors other\nthan properties or relations. On a Humean view of laws of nature, for\ninstance, laws of nature are general facts that supervene on\nparticular facts. But that can be captured by individual property\nsupervenience, even if only in a baroque way. A third potential\ndifference between global and individual supervenience is that the\nformer, but not the latter, is compatible with the supervening and\nsubvening properties being possessed by different individuals (see\nHaugeland 1982). Thus, for example, global supervenience is useful if\nthere can be distinct but spatio-temporally coincident\nobjects\u2014it leaves room to say that the properties of a clay\nstatue supervene upon the properties of the distinct lump of clay that\nconstitutes it (see\n Section 5.5).\n\nWhat the difference between individual and global supervenience really\ncomes to will be discussed throughout the rest of this section.\n4.3.1 Strong Individual Supervenience and Global Supervenience\n\nIt is clear that strong individual supervenience entails global\nsupervenience (see Kim 1984). The question that has attracted\nattention is the converse\u2014whether global supervenience entails\nstrong individual supervenience. In this section, we describe the\ninitial stages of this debate, which took place when the going notion\nof global supervenience was that outlined just above. In Section\n4.3.2, we explain how that notion has been replaced by a family of\nmore precise notions, and explore how it affects the question of\nwhether global supervenience entails strong individual supervenience.\n(Most of the reminder of this section paraphrases McLaughlin 1995,\n55\u201356.)\n\nThe debate began when Kim purported to show that \u201cglobal\nsupervenience is nothing but strong supervenience\u201d (1984, 168).\nIn response, Brad Petrie (1987) argued that global supervenience does\nnot entail strong supervenience. His strategy was to try to provide a\ncounterexample to a strong supervenience thesis that is not a\ncounterexample to the corresponding global supervenience thesis. Here\nis his case. Let set A = {S} and that B =\n{P}. Consider two worlds\nw1 and\nw2 that are as follows: world\nw1 contains exactly two objects,\nx and y. And world\nw2 contains exactly two objects,\nx* and y*. The following purports to be a complete\ndepiction of the contents of those worlds:\n\n\nW1\n\nW2 \n\n\n\n \n\nPx\n\nPx* \n\nSx\n\n~Sx* \n\nPy\n\n~Py* \n\n~Sy\n\n~Sy* \n\n\nThe existence of w1 and\nw2 is incompatible with the thesis\nthat A strongly individually supervenes on B because\nx in w1 is B-indiscernible\nbut A-discernible from x* in\nw2. But the existence of these\nworlds is not itself a counterexample to the global\nsupervenience of A on B. Since\nw1 and w2\ndo not have the same global pattern of distribution of\nB-properties, it seems not to matter that the worlds do not\nhave the same global pattern of distribution of A-properties.\nThus Petrie claimed that \u201csince global supervenience is, and\nstrong supervenience is not, consistent with this example, the two\nconcepts of supervenience are not equivalent\u201d (1987, 121).\n\nIn response, Kim conceded that global supervenience fails to entail\nstrong supervenience (1987, 318), and went on to claim that\nPetrie\u2019s example also shows that global supervenience fails to\nentail weak. Notice that w1 alone\nviolates the weak supervenience of A on B, but also\nfails to be a counterexample to the global supervenience of A\non B. Kim thus concluded that global supervenience fails to\nentail weak or strong individual supervenience.\n\nPaull and Sider pointed out that these argument strategies are no good\n(1992). The problem is that one cannot simply point to two worlds that\ndo not themselves falsify a global supervenience thesis, and then\nclaim that the case is compatible with that thesis. Those two worlds\nmight entail the existence of other worlds that are not\ncompatible with the global supervenience thesis. A global\nsupervenience thesis is a claim about all worlds, not just\ntwo. The upshot is that although a global supervenience thesis fails\nto entail either a weak or strong supervenience thesis in virtue of\nlogical form, it might nevertheless be the case that plausible\nmetaphysical principles entail that whenever the former holds, so does\nthe latter.\n\nPaull and Sider appeal to a plausible principle to show that the\nexistence of Petrie\u2019s w1 and\nw2 entail the existence of a pair\nof worlds that constitutes a counterexample to the global\nsupervenience of A-properties on B-properties (1992,\n838). The basic idea is that for any object in any possible world,\nthere is another world containing an \u201cisolated duplicate\u201d\nof it. Intuitively, the duplicate exists all alone in its world; more\nprecisely, an object y is isolated in a world \u201cif and only if\nthat world contains only (i) y, (ii) y\u2019s\nparts, and (iii) objects whose existence is entail by any of the\nobjects mentioned in (i) and (ii)\u201d (1992, 838\u20139).\nCrucially, isolated duplicates share the intrinsic properties of the\nthings with which they are duplicates. (Two caveats. First, this is\nnot intended to be a definition of \u2018intrinsic\u2019.\nFor some attempts to do so, see e.g., Lewis 1983a, Langton and Lewis\n1998, and a variety of articles in Philosophy and Phenomenological\nResearch 63). Second, notice that the principle does not say that\neach thing can itself exist in isolation; it simply says that each\nthing has a duplicate that does. It consequently does not entail that\nnothing has any essential extrinsic properties.)\n\nPaull and Sider\u2019s isolation principle does the job. Consider\nagain the worlds w1 and\nw2 that Petrie described. Petrie\npurported to describe the worlds in full. Thus, P and\nS are presumably supposed to be intrinsic properties. It\nfollows from the isolation principle that there is a world\nw3 that contains an isolated\nduplicate of x\u2014call it\n\u201cz\u201d\u2014and a world\nw4 that contains an isolated\nduplicate of x*\u2014call it \u201cz*.\u201d As\nPaull and Sider note, these worlds will be as follows:\n\n\nW3\n\nW4 \n\n\n\n \n\nPz\n\nPz* \n\nSz\n\n~Sz* \n\n\nUnlike w1 and\nw2,\nw3 and\nw4 constitute a counterexample to\nthe global supervenience of A-properties on\nB-properties. They have the same pattern of distribution of\nB-properties, but different patterns of distribution of\nA-properties. So, Paull and Sider claim that Petrie failed to\nshow that global supervenience does not entail strong\nsupervenience.\n\nBut Paull and Sider went on to provide a new argument for that claim.\nThey appealed to a set B containing just two properties,\nP and Q, and a set A containing only one\nproperty, M. An object has M just in case it has\nP, and some other object is Q. That is to say,\nMx =df Px &\n\u2203yQy. This definition guarantees that A\nglobally supervenes on B. They then described the following\ntwo worlds:\n\n\nW\n\nW* \n\n\n\n \n\nMa\n\n~Mc \n\nPa\n\nPc \n\n~Mb\n\n \n\nQb\n\n \n\n\nThis pair of worlds shows that A does not strongly supervene\non B. And the principle of isolation cannot be applied to\ngenerate a counterexample to global supervenience. An isolated\nduplicate of a would be both A- and B-indiscernible\nfrom c (an isolated duplicate of a would not have M).\nConsequently, Paull and Sider concluded that global and strong\nsupervenience are not equivalent. (1992, 841).\n\nKlagge (1995) objected to this line of argument. He pointed out that\nPaull and Sider include an extrinsic property M in the\nsupervenient set A, but only intrinsic properties P\nand Q in the subvenient or base set B. And, he\nclaimed, if we allow that there are the sorts of property-forming\noperations required to construct extrinsic property M, then\nPaull and Sider have not exhaustively characterized worlds w\nand w*. For, given those property-forming operations, it is\nplausible that there will, for instance, be a property P#\nthat can be defined as follows: P#\n=df Px &\n\u2203y(y\u2260x). (Basically, a thing is\nP# just in case something else is P.) a in\nw and c in w* differ on this property;\na has P# while c does not. That is right.\nBut Klagge took that to show that w and w* do not\nprovide a counterexample to the strong supervenience of A on\nB after all. That, however, does not follow. It would follow\nonly if a and c thereby counted as\nB-discernible, and they do not. Paull and Sider stipulate\nthat B contains only P and Q. Thus,\na and c are B-indiscernible, despite the\nfact that a has P# and c does not.\n\nBut Klagge was clearly right that Paull and Sider\u2019s example\ninvolves a supervenient set A that contains an extrinsic\nproperty and a subvenient set B that contains only intrinsic\nproperties, and he was right that this is important. It invites the\nquestion whether global supervenience might entail strong\nsupervenience when A and B are sets of intrinsic\nproperties. And it invites the question whether global supervenience\nmight entail strong supervenience when A and B both\ninclude extrinsic properties of certain sorts. Indeed, in response to\nPaull and Sider, Kim suggests that \u201cequivalence seems to fail,\nthrough the failure of implication from global to strong\nsupervenience, only when extrinsic properties are present in the\nsupervenient set but disallowed from the subvenient base\u201d (1993,\n170; see also McLaughlin 1997a, 215). We will return to these\nquestions in the next several sections. Answering them requires\ngetting clearer about global supervenience; to this we now turn.\n4.3.2 Different Versions of Global Supervenience\n\nUntil now, we have been relying mainly on a notion of global\nsupervenience that is defined in terms of what amounts to a notion of\nA/B-indiscernibility of worlds:\n\nA-properties globally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if\nw1 and\nw2 have exactly the same world-wide\npattern of distribution of B-properties, then they have\nexactly the same world-wide pattern of distribution of\nA-properties.\n\n\nBut what is meant by a \u2018world-wide pattern of\ndistribution\u2019 of A- or B-properties? The\nnotion is usually cashed out by appeal to the notion of there being a\ncertain kind of isomorphism or mapping between worlds. For any\nproperty set f, define the notion of an f-preserving\nisomorphism as follows:\n\nAn isomorphism I between the inhabitants of worlds\nw1 and\nw2 preserves f-properties\nif and only if for any x in\nw1, x has a\nf-property P in\nw1 just in case the image of\nx under I (the individual to which I maps x) has\nP in w2.\n\n\nThis purposely avoids appeal to any special relationship that the\nmapped individuals may bear to each other (such, e.g., occupying\ncorresponding locations in their respective worlds). This is to remain\nas neutral as possible on such issues, and because any features used\nto pick out the mapped things would automatically then globally\nsupervene on any properties whatever (see McLaughlin 1995, 1997a). See\nSteinberg 2014 for an alternative way of characterizing world-wide\npatterns of property distribution.\n\nGiven this notion, various different forms of global supervenience\nemerge. Stalnaker 1996, McLaughlin 1996, 1997a, and Sider 1999 all\ndistinguish between a weak and a strong notion of global\nsupervenience, as follows:\n\nA-properties weakly globally supervene on\nB-properties iff for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism between\nw1 and\nw2, then there is an\nA-preserving isomorphism between them.\n\n\nA-properties strongly globally supervene on\nB-properties iff for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, every B-preserving\nisomorphism between w1 and\nw2 is an A-preserving\nisomorphism between them.\n\n\nShagrir (2002) and Bennett (2004a) have both formulated an\nintermediate version:\n\nA-properties intermediately globally supervene on\nB-properties if and only if for any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism between\nw1 and\nw2, then at least one isomorphism\nbetween them is both A-and-B-preserving.\n\n\nIndeed, any number of versions of global supervenience can be\nformulated, simply by specifying exactly how many\nA-and-B-preserving isomorphisms there must be\nbetween worlds between which there is a B-preserving\nisomorphism. Such versions all count as forms of intermediate global\nsupervenience, however, and will be ignored in what follows. Notice\ntoo that it is not always clear which version is intended when someone\nappeals to the notion of global supervenience. Shagrir (2002) and\nBennett (2004a) suggest that there is some reason to think that people\noften intend intermediate; Leuenberger (2009) argues that none of the\nprecisified versions really captures the original concept. Shagrir\nlater argued that strong does the most \u201cjustice to the notion of\nglobal supervenience\u201d (2013).\n\nIt is easy to see that strong global supervenience entails\nintermediate global supervenience, which in turn entails weak global\nsupervenience. If every B-preserving isomorphism\nbetween two worlds must itself be A-preserving, then if there\nare any B-preserving isomorphisms between two worlds at all,\nat least one of them must be A-preserving. So,\nstrong global supervenience entails intermediate. And if at least one\nof any existing B-preserving isomorphisms between two worlds\nmust itself be A-preserving, then it obviously follows that\nif there is a B-preserving isomorphism between two worlds,\nthere must also be an A-preserving one. Thus, intermediate\nglobal supervenience entails weak global supervenience.\n\nIt is also easy to see that strong individual supervenience entails\nstrong global supervenience. Suppose that A-properties fail\nto strongly globally supervene on B-properties. That means\nthat there are two worlds w1 and\nw2 between which there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism that fails to be\nA-preserving. So, for some x in\nw1, the image of x under I\nin w2\u2014call it y\u2014has all\nand only the same B-properties as x in\nw1, but differs from x in\nw1 in at least one of its\nA-properties. But that is just to say that x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible yet\nA-discernible from y in\nw2. It follows that\nB-properties fail to strongly supervene on\nA-properties. Thus, strong individual supervenience entails\nstrong global supervenience, and thereby also entails intermediate and\nweak global supervenience as well.\n\nBut strong global supervenience fails to entail strong individual\nsupervenience, at least when A and B are any\nnonempty sets of properties. Showing this only requires tiny\nmodifications to Paull and Sider\u2019s argument that the notion of\nglobal supervenience spelled out just in terms of world-wide patterns\nof distribution of properties fails to entail strong individual\nsupervenience (Section 4.3.1), and so we will not state the argument\nhere. (See Shagrir 2002, 188.) Once again, the key to the argument is\na case in which the supervening set contains extrinsic properties, and\nthe subvening set does not.\n\nLet us now see what is the case when the supervening and subvening\nproperty sets are brought into line with each other. Recall the\nearlier hypothesis that global and strong individual are equivalent\nwhen Paull-Sider style cases are blocked (see Section 4.3.1). So,\nthen, does strong global entail strong individual when the supervening\nset contains only intrinsic properties? When the subvening set\ncontains both intrinsic properties and all of the extrinsic properties\nthat can be generated from them?\n\nThe answer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201d And it turns out\nthat related argumentative strategies can also be reapplied back to\nthe case of weak and strong individual supervenience. We outline these\nstrategies in the next two sections. However, some of the proofs\nthemselves are complicated, and we thus refer to the reader to the\noriginal literature.\n4.3.3 Equivalences for an Extrinsic Base\n\nStrong global supervenience entails strong individual supervenience as\nlong as the base set B is taken to be closed under\ncomplementation, infinitary conjunction, infinitary disjunction, and\nproperty-forming operations involving quantification and identity. Kim\nanticipates this equivalence (1993, 170), and Robert Stalnaker\nprovides the proof (1996, 238). It should also be noted that John\nBacon argues that if sets of properties A and B are\nclosed under the operations mentioned above and also an operation he\ncalls \u201cresplicing,\u201d then weak and strong individual\nsupervenience both hold or fail to hold together (1986). For\nB to be closed under resplicing is for it to be the case that\nfor any property P such that its extension Pw in a\nworld w is the extension of some property in B,\nP is a member of B.\n\nWe have already noted that it is controversial whether such\nproperty-forming operations are legitimate, and, even if they are, we\nare often interested in property sets that are not closed under them.\nSee\n Section 3.2.\n Still, so long as the property-forming operations are legitimate,\nthen even if B itself is not closed under them, there will\nalways be a larger set B+ which is. That is good\nenough to entail that for every strong global supervenience thesis\nthere is a logically equivalent strong individual supervenience\nthesis. Indeed, if all of these property-forming operations (including\nBacon\u2019s resplicing) are legitimate, then there are property sets\nwith respect to which weak individual supervenience, strong individual\nsupervenience, and strong global supervenience are all equivalent.\n\nBut since there has been considerable dispute over the legitimacy of\nthe various alleged property-forming operations, the issues remain\nunresolved.\n4.3.4 Equivalencies for Intrinsic Properties\n\nIf we bring the property sets into line by restricting both the\nsupervening and subvening sets to intrinsic properties\u2014however\nexactly the notion of an intrinsic property is to be captured\n(see e.g. Langton and Lewis 1998)\u2014we get even clearer results.\nMany varieties of supervenience turn out to be equivalent for\nintrinsic properties.\n\nBoth Shagrir (2002) and Bennett (2004a) argue that strong individual\nsupervenience is equivalent to strong global supervenience when\nA and B are sets of intrinsic properties. Bennett\nalso argues that in such a case even weak global\nsupervenience entails strong individual supervenience. The argument\nrelies upon Paull and Sider\u2019s isolation principle, explained in\nSection 4.3.1 above; the basic idea is to show that any\ncounterexamples to strong individual supervenience can be\n\u201cisolated\u201d to generate counterexamples to weak global\nsupervenience\u2014i.e., pairs of worlds between which there is a\nB-preserving isomorphism but no A-preserving\none.\n\nHere, again, we can also obtain related results about\nindividual supervenience. Mark Moyer (2008) argues that weak\nand strong individual supervenience are equivalent in the special case\nof intrinsic properties. He appeals to a recombination principle\nsimilar to Paull and Sider\u2019s principle of isolation, but with a\ntwist. The intuitive idea is that any two things in any two worlds can\nbe isolated from their surroundings and then put into a world with\neach other. More formally:\n\nRecombination Principle. For any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, any individual x in\nw1 and any individual y in\nw2, there is a world\nw3 that contains individuals\nx\u2032 and y\u2032 such that x\u2032 in\nw3 is an intrinsic-duplicate of\nx in w1 and y\u2032 in\nw3 is an intrinsic-duplicate of\ny in w2.\n\n\nIf this principle is right, then any cross-world pair of individuals\nthat witness the violation of a strong supervenience claim have\nintrinsic-duplicates within a single world. If the supervening\nproperties are intrinsic, those duplicates will violate weak\nsupervenience as well. \n\nIf all of these results are right, then weak individual supervenience,\nstrong individual supervenience, weak global supervenience,\nintermediate global supervenience, and strong global supervenience are\nall equivalent in the special case when A and\nB are sets of intrinsic properties.\n4.3.5 Individual and Global Supervenience Redux\n\nIn Section 4.3.3, we saw that weak and strong individual supervenience\nare equivalent to strong global supervenience in the special case in\nwhich the base set B is closed under certain property forming\noperations. And in 4.3.4, we saw that weak and strong individual\nsupervenience, and weak, intermediate, and strong global supervenience\nare all equivalent in the special case in which A and\nB are sets of intrinsic properties. The upshot is that strong\nglobal and strong individual supervenience come apart \u201conly when\nextrinsic properties are present in the supervenient set but\ndisallowed from the subvenient base,\u201d as Kim and others\npredicted (Section 4.3.1). See Shagrir 2009 for discussion of the case\nof relations.\n\nHowever, weak and intermediate global supervenience are not equivalent\nto strong individual supervenience even when extrinsic properties are\nlet into the base\u2014more precisely, when the base is closed under\nthe relevant property-forming operations. So, perhaps they have\ndistinctive philosophical work to do, work that cannot be done by\nstrong individual supervenience. For example, Sider (1999) appeals to\nweak global supervenience to handle cases of spatio-temporal\ncoincidence, though he retracts this in his (2008). See\n Section 5.5.\n\nBut it is controversial whether these forms of supervenience are\nstrong enough to be philosophically useful. As both Shagrir (2002) and\nBennett (2004a) have pointed out, only strong global supervenience\nguarantees that the world-wide distribution of B-properties\ndetermines the world-wide distribution of A-properties. Both\nweak and intermediate global allow what is called \u2018intraworld\nvariation\u2019\u2014both allow B-indiscernible individuals\nin a world to have different A-properties. (Contrast weak\nindividual supervenience, which allows crossworld variation, but does\nban \u201cmixed worlds.\u201d) Indeed, weak global supervenience\nallows the A-preserving and B-preserving\nisomorphisms to be utterly independent of each other. Suppose some\nproperty being griffic merely weakly globally supervenes on\nthe physical. Then although a world physically just like this one has\nto contain the same number of griffic things as this world, it does\nnot matter which things they are. In this world it might be the Eiffel\nTower and the Queen Mother; in the physical duplicate it might be a\ntea towel and the Grand Canyon.\n\nIn any case, those who assert a weak or intermediate global\nsupervenience thesis while denying the corresponding strong global\nsupervenience thesis need to provide an explanation of why weak or\nintermediate global supervenience holds that does not entail that\nstrong global supervenience holds. (Recall the discussion of weak and\nstrong individual supervenience in\n 4.1).\n That is, they need to explain what enforces the links between\nA- and B-preserving isomorphisms that are required\nby weak and intermediate global, without also enforcing the claim that\nevery B-preserving isomorphism itself be\nA-preserving.\n\nAt present, these issues remain open, and the status of weak and\nintermediate global supervenience is controversial.\n4.4 Similarity Based Supervenience\n\nThis essay has thus far focused on varieties of\nindiscernibility-based supervenience. But in some cases we\nmight be interested in a notion according to which things that are\nvery much alike in B-respects must also be very much alike in\nA-respects. This is similarity-based supervenience (Kim\n1987). (The remainder of this section closely paraphrases McLaughlin\n1995).\n\nWeak and strong versions of similarity-based supervenience can be\ndefined in the expected fashion:\n\nA weakly supervenessim on B if and only\nif for any world w, and for any x and y in\nw, if x and y are not largely different\nwith respect to B-properties, then they are not largely\ndifferent with respect to A-properties.\n\n\nA strongly supervenessim on B if and only\nif for any worlds w1 and w2,\nand for any x in w1 and y in\nw2, if x in w1 is not\nlargely different from y in w2 with\nrespect to B-properties, then x in\nw1 is not largely different from y in\nw2 with respect to A-properties.\n\n\nThese are versions of individual supervenience; global versions can\nalso be formulated. Strong implies weak, but not conversely, except\nfor the special case of intrinsic properties. (The latter can be shown\nby slight modification of Moyer\u2019s argument mentioned in Section\n4.3.4.)\n\nSimilarity-based supervenience is logically independent of\nindiscernibility-based supervenience: neither implies the other.\nSimilarity-based supervenience fails to imply indiscernibility-based\nsupervenience. It may be that there can be A-differences\nwithout B-differences, but that there cannot be\nlarge A-differences without large\nB-differences. And indiscernibility-based supervenience\nlikewise fails to imply similarity-based supervenience. The reason is\nthat there may be small B-differences that are critical\npoints for big A-differences. When that happens,\nsimilarity-based supervenience will fail, even though\nindiscernibility-based supervenience may hold. For example, it might\nwell be the case that small physical differences can be accompanied by\nlarge mental and moral differences. Similarly, a small physical\ndifference like a misplaced brush stroke might have a large effect on\nthe aesthetic value of a painting. Suffice it to note that it remains\nan open question whether there are any interesting philosophical uses\nof similarity-based supervenience.\n4.5 Multiple Domain Supervenience\n\nThus far this essay has focused primarily on single domain\nsupervenience (the exceptions are the discussions of weak and\nintermediate global supervenience). A form of supervenience\ncounts as single domain when and only when the A- and\nB-properties are possessed by the very same\nindividuals\u2014when the way something is in A-respects is\na function of the way it is in B-respects. Both weak\nand strong individual supervenience are clear cases of single domain\nsupervenience. But in some cases, what we want to say is that there\ncannot be an A-difference in certain things without a\nB-difference in certain other things\u2014distinct\nthings to which the former things are related in a certain way. When\nand if this is the case, there is multiple domain supervenience.\n\nOne place such a notion seems useful is in discussions of coincidence\nand material constitution. Those who think that a clay statue is\ndistinct from the lump of clay that make it up will claim that certain\nproperties of the statue must supervene on properties of the lump of\nclay that constitutes it. For example, there could not be two statues\nthat are discernible in shape without the statues being constituted by\nlumps of clay discernible in shape. For further discussion, see\n Section 5.5.\n\nKim (1988) has formulated a weak and strong version of multiple domain\nsupervenience. Let D1 and\nD2 be non-empty domains of\nindividuals, R be a relation between\nD1 and\nD2, and R|x be\nthe subset of D2 to which\nx is R-related. We can define the following\nnotions:\n\n(A, D1) weakly\nmultiple domain supervenes on (B,\nD2) relative to R just in\ncase necessarily for any x and y in\nD1, if R|x and\nR|y are B-indiscernible, then x\nand y are A-indiscernible.\n\n\n(A, D1) strongly\nmultiple domain supervenes on (B,\nD2) relative to relation R\njust in case for any x and y in\nD1 and any worlds\nw1 and\nw2, if R|x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\nR|y in w2,\nx in w1 is\nA-indiscernible from y in\nw2. (Kim 1998)\n\n\nWhen R is identity, these are equivalent, respectively, to\nsingle domain weak and single domain strong individual supervenience.\nIt is because R might be a relation other than identity, for\nexample material constitution, that the definitions have the potential\nfor added utility. Here again, slight modification of Moyer\u2019s\nargument (Section 4.3.4) can be used to show that weak and strong\nmultiple domain supervenience are equivalent when the supervening set\nis intrinsic.\n\nCoincidence-friendly supervenience is another kind of multiple-domain\nsupervenience (proposed by Dean Zimmerman 1995, 88)). It can be\nformulated as follows (see Bennett 2004, 520):\n\nCoincidence-Friendly Supervenience : For all x and\ny, and all worlds w1 and\nw2, if x in\nw1 is B-indiscernible from\ny in w2, then for each\nthing x* in w1 to which\nx is R-related, there is something y* in\nw2 that is R-related to\ny and that is A-indiscernible from x*.\n\n\nThat is a strong version, but a weak version can be formulated as\nfollows:\n\nWeak Coincidence-Friendly Supervenience: For any world\nw and any x and y in w, if\nx in w is B-indiscernible from y\nin w, then for each thing x* to which x is\nR-related in w, there is something y* that\ny is R-related in w and x* is\nA-indiscernible from y*.\n\n\nHere again, when R is identity, these forms of supervenience\nare equivalent, respectively, to weak and strong individual\nsupervenience. And here again, the weak and strong versions are\nequivalent when A is a set of only intrinsic properties.\n\nWeak and strong coincident-friendly supervenience count as kinds of\nmultiple-domain supervenience, but they differ from Kim\u2019s weak\nand strong multiple domain supervenience in at least one important\nrespect. The final quantifier in the definitions of\ncoincident-friendly supervenience is existential, rather than\nuniversal as it is in Kim\u2019s weak and strong multiple domain\nsupervenience. As a result, Kim\u2019s multiple domain supervenience\nsays that if a and b are B-indiscernible,\neach thing R-related to a must be A-indiscernible\nfrom everything R-related to b.\nCoincidence-friendly supervenience says only that each thing\nR-related to a must be A-indiscernible from\nsomething R-related to b. This matters if\nR is B-indiscernibility, as it plausibly is in the\ncase of spatio-temporal coincidence\u2014the main philosophical\napplication of multiple-domain supervenience.\n\nFinally, Ralf Bader (2013) has developed versions of multiple-domain\nsupervenience to model relations between complex entities and their\nparts, including those permitted by non-classical metrologies.\n5. Applications\n5.1 An Argumentative Strategy\n\nRecall that everyone agrees that the reduction of A to\nB implies the supervenience of A on B\n (Section 3.3).\n This gives rise to one central use of supervenience. Arguing against\na supervenience thesis that must be true if some program of reduction\nor conceptual analysis is to succeed is a common way of arguing that\nthe program cannot succeed. McLaughlin (1984, 1995) calls this style\nof argumentation \u2018argument by appeal to a false implied\nsupervenience thesis\u2019\u2014or, for short, argument by appeal to\na FIST.\n\nHere are a few well-known arguments by appeal to a FIST. Suppose\nsomeone claims that there are neurophysiological properties, perhaps\nyet to be discovered, to which intentional properties like believing\nthat P reduce. This claim implies that intentional properties\nsupervene on neurophysiological properties. The Twin Earth thought\nexperiments given by Tyler Burge (1979) and Hilary Putnam (1975) are\n(putative) counterexamples to that supervenience claim; they are cases\nof neurophysiologically indiscernible people whose thoughts have\ndifferent contents.\n\nAnother argument by appeal to a FIST is Chalmers\u2019 appeal to the\n(putative) metaphysical possibility of zombies (see\n Section 3.1\n and\n Section 5.4).\n This is intended to show that phenomenal properties do not\nmetaphysically supervene on, and thus do not reduce to, physical\nproperties. This line of argument is available even though\nphysicalists have not yet proposed any such reduction. If it succeeds,\nthen the project of reducing phenomenal properties to physical\nproperties is doomed to failure.\n\nConsider a third example, from epistemology. A simple causal\ntheory of perceptual knowledge says that a subject\u2019s perceptual\nknowledge that P can be analyzed in terms of\nP\u2019s bearing the right kind of causal relation to the\nsubject\u2019s belief that P. To test this claim, we need\nnot await proposals as to what the kind of causal relation in question\nis. For this project of conceptual analysis can succeed only if two\nbelievers that P cannot differ with respect to perceptually\nknowing that P without differing with respect to how\nP is causally connected to their belief that P.\nAlvin Goldman\u2019s fake barn country case (1976) yields a\n(putative) counterexample to this supervenience claim.\n\nOf course, it is controversial whether any of these arguments\nsucceed, because it is controversial whether the alleged\ncounterexamples to the supervenience claims are really possible. But\nin all three cases, the style of argument is the same\u2014argument\nby appeal to a FIST. (See McLaughlin 1984, 1995.)\n5.2 Internalism/Externalism\n\nDistinctions between internalism and externalism arise in many areas\nin philosophy\u2014philosophy of mind, philosophy of language,\nepistemology, and ethics. All of these distinctions can be\ncharacterized by means of supervenience theses. For example, an\ninternalist about mental content accepts, and an externalist denies,\nthat what a mental state is about supervenes upon neurophysiological\nproperties, or \u201cwhat\u2019s in the head.\u201d The dispute is\nabout whether two thinkers can differ in the contents of their mental\nstates without also differing in some neurophysical respect.\nSimilarly, an internalist about epistemic justification accepts, and\nan externalist denies, that whether a belief is justified supervenes\nupon the mental properties of the believer. The dispute is about\nwhether two believers can differ in whether their beliefs are\njustified without also differing in some mental respect. And an\ninternalist about moral motivation accepts, and an externalist denies,\nthat moral motivation supervenes upon moral judgment. The dispute is\nabout whether two (rational) people can differ in how they are\nmotivated to act without also differing in their judgments about which\nof those actions they ought to perform.\n\nRelatedly, supervenience can also be used to capture the traditional\ndistinction between internal and external relations. As Lewis has\nnoted (1986b, 62), an internal relation (such as being taller\nthan) supervenes on the intrinsic natures of its relata. An\nextrinsic relation (such as being 3 kilometers from ) does\nnot. The main difference between this case and those above is that\nhere there is no real dispute about whether the supervenience thesis\nholds or not; it is widely agreed that there are two kinds of\nrelations.\n5.3 Haecceitism\n\nHaecceitism is the view that identity properties, like being Kofi\nAnnan or being that particular table, do not supervene\non qualitative properties. On this view, every two numerically\ndistinct things differ haecceitistically, but no other difference\nfollows. Questions about whether there could be qualitatively\nindiscernible but numerically distinct things becomes important in\nmodal metaphysics.\n\nThe issue here is an instance of something more general. Supervenience\nplays a useful role in answering questions about the identity and\nindividuation conditions for things belonging to some kind. As\nDavidson pointed out, there is a prima facie puzzle (1980,\nch. 5) about how to address such questions. The answer to the question\n\u201cWhen are two events identical?\u201d is\ntrivial\u2014\u201cNever.\u201d And the answer to the question\n\u201cWhen is an event identical with itself?\u201d is likewise\ntrivial\u2014\u201cAlways.\u201d But surely there is a substantive\nquestion lurking here. Davidson himself opted to get around this worry\nby means of semantic ascent. But an alternative is to move to what\nDavid Lewis calls \u2018a nonduplication principle\u2019 (see J.\nBennett 1988). Instead of asking when two events are identical, we can\nask a fill in the blank question: \u2018no two events can be just\nalike with respect to ______\u2019? Davidson would fill in the blank\nwith \u2018their causes and effects\u2019. Kim would fill in the\nblank with \u2018their subject, time, and constitutive\nproperty\u2019 (1976); others fill in the blank in other ways.\n\nWhat matters here is just that nonduplication principles are\nsupervenience theses. They are supervenience theses that take the\nsupervening set A to be the identity facts for particular\nentities of whatever kind is in question. There cannot be a difference\nin whether an event has a property like being event e without\na difference in its causes and effects (Davidson) or in its subject,\nconstitutive property, and time (Kim). Note that any view that accepts\na nonduplication principle for some sort of entity is ipso\nfacto anti-haecceitist. Both Davidson and Kim are\nanti-haecceitists about events.\n5.4 Characterizing Physicalism\n\nRoughly speaking, physicalism is the view that somehow or other,\neverything is settled by the physical. This is of course vague along a\nnumber of dimensions. One question, beyond the scope of this essay, is\nwhat exactly \u2018physical\u2019 means (see Stoljar\u2019s entry\non physicalism). Another question is about the scope of the\nquantifier: should it really range over everything, or should the\nthesis be restricted to the mental (thus leaving room for non-physical\nentities like platonic numbers, abstract universals, or God)? While\nthe sociological question of which of these theses is usually intended\nis also beyond the scope of this essay, the distinction will appear\nagain. And a third question is what exactly \u2018settled by\u2019\nmeans. \n\nThis last question is the relevant one here, because for a roughly 30\nyear period beginning with Davidson\u2019s \u201cMental Events\u201d\n(1970, 214), philosophers used supervenience as a placeholder for the\nneeded relation. That is, physicalism was regularly characterized as\nthe view that everything\u2014or perhaps just the\nmental\u2014supervenes on the physical. More specifically, it was\nfrequently characterized as a i) metaphysically necessary ii) strong\nglobal supervenience thesis that is iii) restricted to only a certain\nrange of worlds. We shall say a bit about each in turn, before\nmentioning the more recent turn to instead characterizing physicalism\nin terms of grounding.\n5.4.1 Why say that the thesis is metaphysically necessary?\n\nPhysicalists take the supervenience thesis to hold with metaphysical\nnecessity, because a merely nomologically necessary supervenience\nthesis is compatible with dualism. Dualists can maintain that there\nare fundamental psychophysical laws that maintain the supervenience\nconnection (McLaughlin 1992, Chalmers 1996). Since no physicalist will\nagree, capturing physicalism requires a supervenience thesis that\nholds with full-blown metaphysical necessity. \n5.4.2 Why use strong global supervenience?\n\nPhysicalism is characterized in terms of global supervenience as\nopposed to individual supervenience because an individual\u2019s mental\nstates do not locally supervene on her intrinsic brain states for\nreasons that do not impugn physicalism as intuitively understood.\nNotably, the contents of her propositional attitudes depend upon the\nsurrounding environment if any kind of externalism is true (See Putnam\n1975 and the entry on externalism). \n\nBut why strong global supervenience instead of one of the weaker two\nvarieties, intermediate or weak (see\n 4.3.2)?\n The answer is that neither of those is strong enough. An intermediate\nglobal supervenience thesis would allow a world physically\nindiscernible from this one, in which precisely the same mental\nproperties are instantiated as are instantiated here, but in which\nphysically indiscernible individuals swap mental lives. A weak global\nsupervenience characterization of physicalism would go further. It\nwould allow a world physically indiscernible from this one, in which\nprecisely the same mental properties are instantiated as are\ninstantiated here, but in which they are differently distributed among\nentities without any restriction. For example, a weak global\nsupervenience characterization of physicalism is compatible with the\nexistence of a world physically indiscernible from this one in which\nTaylor Swift and Peter Singer exchange mental lives (see\n 4.3.5).\n Physicalism should not allow either sort of mental property\nswapping.\n5.4.3 Why restrict the thesis to a certain range of worlds?\n\nStill, physicalism cannot just be the thesis that the mental facts (or\nall the facts) strongly globally supervenience with\nlogical/metaphysical necessity on the physical facts and laws, because\nmany physicalists want to allow for the metaphysical possibility of\nthings like ghosts or Cartesian souls. They think that there actually\naren\u2019t any such things, not that there could not be any, nor\neven that there could not be any compatibly with the physical facts of\nour world. They thus do in fact allow that two worlds could be\nphysical duplicates but differ mentally, in virtue of only one of them\ncontaining disembodied spirits, say. (Note that because the worlds are\nphysical duplicates, those spirits either exert no causal influence on\nthe physical at all, or else only exert redundant,\n\u2018overdeterministic\u2019 causal influence on the physical.)\n\nVarious philosophers have offered various ways of defining physicalism\nto allow for this possibility, while continuing to rely upon global\nsupervenience. The key in all cases is to limit the range of worlds in\nwhich the global supervenience thesis holds. For example, David Lewis\ntook physicalism to be the claim that\n\nAmong worlds where no natural properties alien to our world are\ninstantiated, no two differ without differing physically; any two such\nworlds that are exactly alike physically are duplicates (Lewis 1983b,\n364).\n Jackson offers the following:\n\n\nAny world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world is a\nduplicate simpliciter (Jackson, 1998, 12).\n\n\nwhere a minimal physical duplicate is what results from duplicating\nall the physical facts and \u201cstopping right there.\u201d And David\nChalmers says that physicalism is true in a world w just in case every\npositive fact that obtains in w also obtains in any world physically\nindiscernible from w (1996, 39\u201340). Each of these three\ndefinitions allows for worlds in which physicalism fails: worlds that\nare physical duplicates of the actual world, and in which there are\nghosts or souls.\n5.4.4 Beyond supervenience physicalism \n\nUnfortunately, even these sophisticated supervenience formulations\nfail to provide an adequate characterization of physicalism. There are\nat least three reasons for this failure, and necessarily existing\nentities or necessarily obtaining facts generate not one but two of\nthem. \n\nRecall that necessary beings (whether entities, facts, or whatever)\nsupervene on anything whatsoever, for the simple reason that such\nthings exist in every world. Because no two worlds can differ in\nwhether they exist, full stop, no two worlds can differ in whether\nthey exist without differing in x, for whatever x\nyou like (see\n section 3.5).\n \n\nThe first problem that necessary beings pose is only a problem for\nwide scope physicalism, the version of the view that says that truly\neverything, not just the mental facts, supervenes on the physical\nfacts. The difficulty is that some putative necessarily existing\nthings, like Platonic numbers or God, do not seem physicalistically\nkosher. Yet their actual existence is compatible with a global\nsupervenience formulation of physicalism.\n\nThe second problem is a problem for both wide scope physicalism and a\nnarrower version only about the mental. As discussed in\n section 3.5),\n the fact that necessarily existing things supervene on anything\nwhatsoever shows that supervenience is not ontological dependence or\ndetermination. After all, the putative fact that God exists globally\nsupervenes on the fact that my cat is named Snoop without the former\nin any way depending on the latter. This is supervenience on the\ncheap, not anything strong enough for physicalism. (For other putative\ncounterexamples to the sufficiency of the supervenience thesis, see\nWitmer 1999 and Hawthorne 2002.)\n\nThe third issue is closely related to the second, though it doesn\u2019t\nturn on necessary existence in particular. It is that many think the\ncorrect statement of physicalism should be in some way explanatory in\na way that the bare supervenience claim is not. One version of this is\nto say that physicalism should say that the physical facts explain the\nmental ones. The supervenience claim alone says no such thing, as\nshown by the case of necessary existents as well as the case of\nproperties supervening on their negations. A different version of this\nis to say that physicalism requires\n\u2018superdupervenience\u2019\u2014that physicalism should explain\nwhy the relevant global supervenience theses holds (see Blackburn\n1984, Horgan 1993, Melnyk 2003, and Wilson 2005). Concerns like these\nshould be familiar from sections\n 3.5\n and\n 3.7).\n \n\nSome think that these concerns can be avoided by moving from\ncharacterizing physicalism in terms of supervenience to characterizing\nphysicalism in terms of grounding (e.g. Rosen 2010, 111; Dasgupta\n2014, 557; Schaffer 2017, section 4). Because grounding is supposed to\nbe hyperintensional, it is not the case that necessary beings or facts\nare grounded by just anything. And grounding is supposed to back\nexplanations as well.\n\nHowever, whether the appeal to grounding really advances anything is a\nmatter of dispute (Wilson 2016). See Stoljar\u2019s entry on physicalism\nfor further discussion. Further, note that we have only raised\nchallenges for the claim that a strong global supervenience thesis is\nsufficient for physicalism. It remains open that some such\nthesis is necessary for physicalism. If it is, then grounding\nphysicalism needs to entail supervenience physicalism. (For\nconsiderations against, see Skiles 2014; for considerations in favor,\nsee Bennett 2017, 3.3.) And if it is, physicalism would remain\ntestable by exposing it to would-be arguments by appeal to FISTS, such\nas the zombie argument. \n5.5 Coincident Entities and the \u201cGrounding Problem\u201d\n\nIt is fairly widely held that more than one object can occupy the same\nspatio-temporal location. Such objects are said to be\nspatio-temporally coincident. The classic example is a statue,\nGoliath, and the lump of clay that constitutes it, Lumpl (see Gibbard\n1975). On one version of the story, Lumpl sits around on a shelf for a\nfew days before the sculptor shapes it into Goliath on a Thursday\nmorning. It looks like Lumpl existed on the previous Wednesday and\nthat Goliath did not, and consequently looks like Leibniz\u2019s Law\nentails that they are distinct objects. On another version of the\nstory, Lumpl and Goliath are created and destroyed at precisely the\nsame moment. Here the two do not have different temporal properties,\nbut they do have different modal ones\u2014Lumpl would still\nexist if we squashed it into a ball, but Goliath would not. Again,\nLeibniz\u2019s Law apparently entails that they are distinct. (See\nRea 1997a for many interesting papers on this issue.)\n\nThe main objection to the view that Goliath and Lumpl are distinct is\nwhat can be called \u2018the grounding problem\u2019. How can Lumpl\nand Goliath differ in their modal properties, given that they are\nalike in every other way? What grounds their difference in\npersistence conditions? In virtue of what do they have the persistence\nconditions they do?\n\nThe grounding problem is sometimes characterized in terms of\nsupervenience failure. Lumpl and Goliath differ in their persistence\nconditions without differing in their physical or categorical\nproperties (see Yablo 1987 for a discussion of categoricity). And it\nis true that many forms of supervenience fail: weak and strong\nindividual supervenience and strong global supervenience all fail. But\nthere are forms of supervenience that can hold. Both weak and\nintermediate global supervenience hold, as does (as the name suggests)\ncoincidence-friendly supervenience, and possibly other versions of\nmultiple-domain supervenience (c.f. Zimmerman 1995, Rea 1997b, Sider\n1999, Baker 2000). All of these forms hold on the plausible assumption\nthat any two regions physically/categorically just like this one will\ncontain an object with Goliath\u2019s persistence conditions, and an\nobject with Lumpl\u2019s persistence conditions.\n\nBut the crucial question is not whether any form of supervenience\nholds, but rather whether those that hold constitute a satisfactory\nanswer to the grounding problem. For a defense of the positive answer,\nsee Sider 1999; for a defense of the negative answer, see Bennett\n2004b. For a new take, see Sider 2008. ",
