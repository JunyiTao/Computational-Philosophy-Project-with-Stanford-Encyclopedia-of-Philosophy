    "main_text": "What Makes Public Health, And Therefore Public Health Ethics, Distinctive? || Population Focus\n1.1 Population Focus\n\nThe first and perhaps most defining characteristic of public health is\nthat it is committed to advancing health at the level of populations.\nBy contrast, in clinical practice, the focus is on the health of each\npatient, as an individual. While health is primarily understood as a\nprivate good in clinical care, in public health, health is a good of a\ngroup or collective that, in some sense, constitutes the public.\n\nPublic health\u2019s population focus necessitates that it deals only\nwith aggregated health concerns when setting goals and assessing\noutcomes. This need in public health to aggregate \u2013 and\ntherefore obscure individual or even sub-group \u2013 interests in\nhealth is, in turn, one of the reasons why so much of the literature\nin public health ethics engages questions of justice. We take up some\nof these questions in Section 2.\n\nPublic health\u2019s population focus also positions it well to lead\non the prevention of disease and injury (Rose 1985, Rose et al. 2008;\nChildress et al. 2002; Faden, Shebaya, and Siegel 2019). Although\nclinicians often incorporate preventive interventions in their\npractice with patients, no other social institution is generally\nrecognized as so clearly having a prevention remit. Many public health\nagencies, including in the US the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention and the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition\nare designed to prevent illness and injury at the population level.\nPublic health\u2019s commitment to prevention carries with it particular\nmoral challenges. Eliminating or mitigating harm that already exists\nis sometimes viewed as being of greater moral importance \u2013 or\nsimply as more immediately motivating action \u2013 than long-term\nstrategies to prevent harm from materializing. Whether it is ethically\njustifiable to privilege the interests of the currently ill, who are\noften known and identifiable, over those of future people who cannot\nnow be identified is a paradigmatic challenge of justice in public\nhealth ethics addressed briefly in Section 2.\n1.1.1 Who is the Public in Public Health?\n\nWhile many of the moral challenges that arise from public\nhealth\u2019s population health focus are primarily questions of\njustice, in this Section and in Section 1.1.2 we consider some\nchallenges, including some conceptual challenges, that are not.\n\nThat the object of moral concern in public health is the public rather\nthan individuals (Rose 1985; Rose et al. 2008; Coggon 2012) raises a\nconceptual question: what or who is the public? While interesting in\nits own right, this question is also important because it informs\njustificatory challenges that public health ethics has to address: who\nis public health good for? Whose health are we concerned with, and\nwhat sacrifices is it acceptable to ask of individuals in order to\nachieve it? And why is public health a good worth promoting?\n\nIn attempting to answer these questions, it is worth beginning by\nquerying whether, as has been used so far, the terms\n\u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cpopulation\u201d are interchangeable\nto designate the entity whose health is the object of public health\nconcern. Is there a significant conceptual difference, a difference in\nmoral valence, or a difference in attitude and orientation between\npublic health ethics on the one hand, and population-level health\nethics on the other? The literature presents three general ways of\ndenoting the object of public health: the community, the public, and\npopulations. In one sense, the most morally laden manner of\ndesignating those who are subject to, and benefit from, public health\nmeasures, is to think about them as a community (Beauchamp and\nSteinbock 1999). Reference to \u201ccommunity\u201d implies a\ncohesive group, usually with a shared language, culture, history, and\ngeographical location. Characterizing the concern of public health as\nbeing the health of the community renders more natural (and possibly\nmore plausible) appeal to the common good as a way of justifying\npublic health interventions.\n\nReference to \u201cthe public\u201d shares some of those same\nfeatures but tends to be less morally laden. This is in part because\n\u201cthe public\u201d is somewhat more anonymous than \u201cthe\ncommunity\u201d and does not necessarily signal a tight cultural\nconnection. Rather, it connotes a relatively discrete unit with some\ncommon institutions and usually a shared political life. References to\nthe public as well as to the community may encourage the perception\nthat the good we are seeking to advance is that of a geographically\nbounded unit, with community connoting stronger cultural associations,\nand public connoting some kind of official political unit such as a\nstate or a country with geographically defined boundaries. One reason\nto be hesitant to accept this characterization is its problematic fit\nwith some threats to health. Communicable diseases, for example, have\na way of ignoring national boundaries, and preventive measures in one\ncountry may be futile if other countries do not follow\n suit.[2]\n\nCharacterizing the health we are trying to advance as that of\npopulations, by contrast, may minimize the implication that special\nshared features or characteristics are needed in order for a group of\nindividuals to constitute a collective unit whose health can be of\nconcern. Because of that, it may lend itself more readily to an\ninternationalist, less inward-looking orientation: any population,\nregardless of nationality or geographic location, has health interests\nthat ought to be attended to and advanced (Wikler & Brock 2007).\nPopulations can be more local or more global than a community or the\npublic. This way of speaking also may dilute the emphasis on national\nborders as a way of delineating the scope of concern and provides more\nflexibility in the object of concern for public health. In much the\nsame way, discussion of global health, as opposed to international\nhealth, is seen as helpful in emphasizing a focus on the health needs\nof all, as opposed to a focus on international cooperation and the\nhealth needs of peoples in countries other than one\u2019s own. This is\nnot, of course, to say that those who prefer the term \u201cpublic\nhealth\u201d to \u201cpopulation health\u201d do not share a global\norientation. Indeed, the World Health Organization is generally\nreferred to as a global public health institution, and those who work\nto promote health transnationally are referred to as public health and\nnot population health professionals. Indeed, although some see a\nsubstantive conceptual divergence in ways of thinking about whose\nhealth is to be protected and promoted, others see no conflict, at\nleast between the concepts of public health and population health. For\nexample, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics uses the term\n\u201cpopulation health\u201d to refer to the collective state of\nhealth of members of a population and the term \u201cpublic\nhealth\u201d to refer to efforts made to improve the political,\nregulatory and economic environments that affect prospects for health.\nSo understood, the object of public health is the improvement of\npopulation health (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007, p. XV).\n\nDepending on the particular health challenge we are concerned with,\nthe public in question can be more local or more global than a single\ncountry\u2019s population. National boundaries are relevant because\nindividual countries usually set policies and regulations, which vary\nfrom country to country. They are also relevant for reasons having to\ndo with government control: countries report their data about\ncommunicable disease outbreaks, the burdens of disease, and other\nhealth indicators to global institutions such as the WHO on a\nvoluntary basis. Although International Health Regulations to which\n196 countries (WHO 2014) are signatories provide an international\nstructure for global public health, as with much international law and\nregulation, enforcement mechanisms are weak. The moral implications of\nthese practical limitations for public health are profound. The\nstructure of the problem is similar to environmental challenges such\nas climate change, which, as we note in 1.3, is itself increasingly\nbeing framed as a public health crisis. Some of the determinants of\nill health are not restricted by national boundaries, nor can they be\neffectively addressed by any nation on its own.\n1.1.2 What is the Health in Public Health?\n\nRegardless of how one specifies the contours of the public \u2013 as\na population, as a public, or as a more local community \u2013 a\ndistinct set of conceptual challenges central to public health ethics\nconcerns how to think about the nature of the health of the group and\nhow this differs from the health of individuals.\n\nThere are significant debates about how to conceptualize health; is it\nthe absence of disease, or does it involve more than that? Can health\nbe defined without reference to normative concepts? Other debates\nconcern the value of health, and whether health is good as an end,\ngood as a means or both or neither; whether the attitudes towards a\ngiven condition of those who have it affect whether it counts as\nhealthy or unhealthy; and a variety of other questions. (Ananth 2008;\nBoorse 1975; Coggon 2012; Hoffman 2010; Holland 2007; see the entry on\n concepts of health and disease).\n We will not rehearse these debates here. Even if we put these\nquestions about the concept of health to the side, however, there are\nother questions that concern the nature of public health. Can the\nhealth of the public meaningfully be understood only as an aggregation\nof the health of each person that comprises the public, or is it\nsomething more than that? Is the health of the public something of\nvalue in its own right?\n\nThese questions are important because they have implications for\nparticular views on the ethics of public health. Some theorists of\npublic health treat the health of the public as something that cannot\nbe reduced to healthy individuals \u2013 what we will call\n\u2018anti-reductionist\u2019 views. Anti-reductionist views often\nconstrue the public as a community or political entity rather than a\npopulation. (Coggon 2012; Jennings 2007). If one endorses\nanti-reductionism, then various values might seem especially central\nto theorizing about public health. For instance, some argue that\ncommunal values, such as solidarity, are integral to understanding the\nvalue of public health. (Dawson and Jennings 2012; Jennings and Dawson\n2015). These views typically call for an extensive role for government\ninterventions aimed at promoting public health, although this is not a\nconceptually necessary feature of such views.\n\nReductionists, by contrast, think that the health of a public is\nreducible to an aggregation of the health of individuals. This claim\nabout reduction, however, need not signal an aversion to an extensive\nrole for government in protecting or promoting public health. That is,\nsome might deny that there is an entity, \u2018the public,\u2019\nthat matters morally in a way that cannot be reducible to individual\ninterests or values but agree with anti-reductionists about policy\nmeasures. For example, it is possible that focusing on measures that\nreduce the incidence of disease in a population will be better at\nproducing more value for individuals than a focus on treating or\npreventing disease for individuals. (Rose 1985; Rose et al. 2008)\nPresumably, various anti-reductionists would argue for a similar\nconclusion, although they would invoke other values to reach it.\n\nA third class of views is also reductionist but calls for a more\ncircumscribed range of public health interventions. For instance,\nclassical liberals often argue that it is morally impermissible for\ngovernment actors to intervene in ways that produce aggregate value\nwhen doing so infringes on individual liberty. More will be said about\nliberalism and public health in Section 3.2. Although these writers\nendorse a more restrictive view of the mandate of public health, some\nwould nevertheless endorse governments producing health-related public\ngoods, such as herd immunity (Anomaly 2011, 2012; Brennan 2018; Dees\n2018; Epstein 2004; Flanigan 2014b, 2017; Horne 2019).\n\nIn the economic sense of the term, public goods are non-rivalrous,\nwhich means that one person\u2019s enjoyment or consumption of the\ngood does not reduce the ability of others to enjoy that good. Public\ngoods are also non-excludable, which means it is very difficult to\nprevent others from enjoying the public good. (See the entry on\n the free-rider problem.)\n Paradigmatic public goods in public health include herd immunity,\nsanitation, and clean air. Not all the goods of public health are\npublic goods in this sense, however.\n\nConsider two concepts that are often invoked in debates about the\njustification for public health interventions- the \u2018common\ngood\u2019 and the \u2018public good.\u2019 These terms are\npolysemous, and this sometimes leads to confusion. Some uses of these\nterms are associated with political values as, for example, when\n\u2018the common good\u2019 refers to values shared or pursued\ncollectively by all members of a community. Many anti-reductionists\nwill invoke \u2018the common good,\u2019 so understood, to justify\npublic health interventions and policies. For instance, some argue\nthat all members of the same community, qua members of the same\ncommunity, have an interest in living in a social grouping in which\nall enjoy a high degree of health. Economists, by contrast, use\n\u2018common good\u2019 to refer to a pooled resource that is\nrivalrous (one person\u2019s usage diminishes the ability of others\nto use it) but non-excludable (it is quite difficult to exclude others\nfrom using it). In some public health contexts, safe water, food and\ndrugs can be understood as common goods in this sense.\n",
