    "main_text": "Feminist Principles\n8. Feminist Principles\n\nThere is no one feminist conception of distributive justice; feminists\ndefend positions across the political spectrum. Hence, feminists offer\ndistinctive versions of all the theories considered so far as well as\nothers. One way of thinking about what unifies many feminist theorists\nis an interest in what difference, if any, the practical experience of\ngender makes to the subject matter or study of justice; how different\nfeminists answer this question distinguishes them from each other and\nfrom those alternative distributive principles that most inspire their\nthinking.\n\nThe distributive principles so far outlined, with the exception of\nstrict egalitarianism, are often described as falling under the broad\nclassification of liberalism\u2014they both inform, and are the\nproduct of, the liberal democracies which have emerged over the last\ntwo centuries. Lumping them together this way, though somewhat clumsy,\nmakes the task of understanding the emergence of feminist critiques\n(and the subsequent positive theories) much easier.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill in The Subjection of Women (1869) gives one\nof the clearest early feminist critiques of the political and\ndistributive structures of the emerging liberal democracies. His\nwritings provided the starting point for many contemporary liberal\nfeminists. Mill argued that the principles associated with the\ndeveloping liberalism of his time required equal political status for\nwomen. The principles Mill explicitly mentions include a rejection of\nthe aristocracy of birth, equal opportunity in education and in the\nmarketplace, equal rights to hold property, a rejection of the man as\nthe legal head of the household, and equal rights to political\nparticipation. Feminists inspired by Mill believe that a proper\nrecognition of the position of women in society requires that women be\ngiven equal and the same rights as men have, and that these primarily\nprotect their liberty and their status as equal persons under the law.\nThus, government regulation should not prevent women from competing on\nequal terms with men in educational, professional, marketplace and\npolitical institutions. The problem for women, on the liberal feminist\nview, is not liberalism but the failure of society and the State to\nproperly instantiate liberal principles.\n\nFrom the point of view of other feminisms, the liberal feminist\nposition is a conservative one, in the sense that it requires the\nproper inclusion for women of the rights, protections, and\nopportunities previously secured for men, rather than a fundamental\nchange from the traditional liberal position. One phrase or motto\naround which a whole range of feminists have rallied marks a\nsignificant break with Mill\u2019s liberalism: \u2018the personal is\npolitical.\u2019 Feminists have offered a variety of interpretations\nof this motto, many of which take the form of a critique of liberal\ntheories. Mill was crucial in developing the liberal doctrine of\nlimiting the state\u2019s intervention in the private lives of\ncitizens. Many contemporary feminists have argued that the resulting\nliberal theories of justice have fundamentally been unable to\naccommodate the injustices that have their origins in this\n\u2018protected\u2019 private sphere. This particular feminist\ncritique has also been a primary source of inspiration for the broader\nmulticultural critique of liberalism. The liberal commitments to\ngovernment neutrality and to a protected personal sphere of liberty,\nwhere the government must not interfere, have been primary critical\ntargets.\n\nWhile issues about neutrality and personal liberty go beyond debates\nabout distributive justice they also have application within these\ndebates. The feminist critics recognize that liberalism correctly\nidentifies the government as one potential source of oppression\nagainst individuals, and therefore recommends powerful political\nprotections of individual liberty. They argue, however, that liberal\ntheories of distributive justice are unable to address the oppression\nwhich surfaces in the so-called private sphere of government\nnon-interference. Susan Moller Okin, for example, documents the\neffects of the institution of the nuclear family, arguing that the\nconsequence of this institution is a position of systematic material\nand political inequality for women. Standard liberal theories,\ncommitted to neutrality in the private sphere, seem powerless to\naddress (or sometimes even recognize) striking and lasting\ninequalities for women, minorities, or historically oppressed racial\ngroups, when these are merely the cumulative effect of\nindividuals\u2019 free behavior. Okin and others demonstrate, for\nexample, that women have substantial disadvantages in competing in the\nmarket because of childrearing responsibilities which are not equally\nshared with men. As a consequence, any theory relying on market\nmechanisms, including most liberal theories, will yield systems which\nresult in women systematically having less income and wealth than men.\nThus, feminists have challenged contemporary political theorists to\nrethink the boundaries of political authority in the name of securing\na just outcome for women and other historically oppressed groups.\n\nWhile the political effects of personal freedom pose a serious\nchallenge to contemporary liberal theories of distributive justice,\nthe feminist critiques are somewhat puzzling because, as Jean Hampton\nputs it, many feminists appear to complain in the name of liberal\nvalues. In other words, their claims about the fundamental flaws of\nliberalism at the same time leave intact the various ideals of liberty\nand equality which inspire the liberal theories of justice. Moreover,\nthe task of defining feasible pathways for modifying the structure of\nliberal democracies without undermining their virtues and protections\nhas proved more difficult than setting out the criticisms of\nliberalism. Indeed, despite a legitimate feminist worry about the\neffects of so-called government neutrality on women\u2019s material\nstatus, the relative neutrality of liberal democracies compared to\nnon-liberal societies has been one of the significant contributing\nfactors both to the flourishing of feminist theory and to the many\nsignificant practical gains women in liberal democracies have made\nrelative to women in other parts of the world. The challenge, being\ntaken up by many, is to navigate both a coherent theoretical and\npractical path in response to the best feminist critiques available\n(see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n \n",
