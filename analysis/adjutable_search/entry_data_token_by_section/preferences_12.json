    "main_text": "Preferences combination || Total and partial preferences\n4.2 Total and partial preferences\n\nConsider again the choice among alternative architectural designs for\na new building. As indicated above, our preferences can be expressed\nwith a vector \\(\\langle \\succcurlyeq_1 ,\\ldots ,\\succcurlyeq_n\n\\rangle\\), each of whose elements represents our partial\npreferences with respect to some particular aspect such as\nsustainability or aesthetics. If we manage to aggregate the vector to\na single preference relation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\), then \\(\\succcurlyeq\\)\nrepresents our total preferences, or, as they are also\ncalled, our \u201cpreferences tout court\u201d or\n\u201cpreferences all things considered\u201d. \n\nSome authors have argued that the preference notion in economics\nalways refers to total preferences (Hausman 2012). However, there are\nalso economists who recognize partial preferences, often identifying\nthem with preferences over properties or characteristics of economic\ngoods (Lancaster 1966). In contrast, philosophers often treat partial\npreferences as referring to different reasons that one may have to\nprefer one of the options to another (Pettit 1991, Osherson and\nWeinstein 2012). \n\nAuthors who recognize partial preferences usually give them priority,\nand consider total preferences to be completely determined by the\npartial preferences. In other words, they assume that a total\npreference relation is uniquely determined by the partial preference\nrelations through a process of aggregation. There are different views\non the nature of this process. According to a quantitative\napproach, each partial preference is connected with a cardinal partial\nutility function for the aspect in question, and the total preference\nrelation can be obtained by aggregating these partial utility\nfunctions using an appropriate set of weights. This requires strong\nassumptions of preference independence in order to justify additivity\nof utility (Keeney and Raiffa 1993). \n\nAn alternative strategy employs tools from social choice\ntheory to map a vector of partial preferences into a total\npreference relation. This approach only makes use of ordinal\ninformation, and disregards any utility information that has no impact\non the partial preference relations. Unsurprisingly, the impossibility\nresults of social choice theory affect this method. Steedman and\nKrause (1986) have shown that there is no rule for deriving total\npreferences from a preference vector that satisfies four seemingly\nplausible conditions and also yields a transitive and complete total\npreference ordering. When applied to an intrapersonal conflict this\nmeans that an agent may be rational in the sense of having a complete\nand transitive (partial) relation for each of the aspects, but may\nstill be irrational either in the sense of not satisfying plausible\nconditions on the relations between partial and total preferences, or\nin the sense of not having a complete and transitive total preference\nordering for her overall appraisal of the options in question. This\nargument connects with a long philosophical tradition, including Plato\nand Bishop Butler, that draws an analogy between intrapersonal\nconflicts and citizens\u2019 conflicting preferences within a state.\n\n\nThere are also authors who reject the idea that total preferences are\nuniquely derivable from partial preferences. Instead they claim that\ntotal preferences are constructed at the moment of\nelicitation, and thus influenced by contexts and framings of the\nelicitation procedure that are not encoded in pre-existing partial\npreferences (Payne, Bettman and Johnson 1993). Total preferences seem\nto be influenced by direct affective responses that are independent of\ncognitive processes (Zajone 1980). For instance, food preferences seem\nto be partly determined by habituation and are therefore difficult to\nexplain as the outcome of a process exclusively based on well-behaved\npartial preferences. According to this view, partial preferences are\nin many cases ex post rationalisations of total preferences,\nrather than the basis from which total preferences are derived. \n\nA closely related standpoint was expressed by Nozick (1981, 244):\n\u201cReasons do not come with previously assigned weights; the\ndecision process is not one of discovering such precise weights but of\nassigning them. The process not only weighs reasons, it (also) weights\nthem.\u201d According to Kranz (1991, 34), \u201c[p]eople do and\nshould act as problem solvers, not maximizers, because they have\nmany different and incommensurable \u2026 goals to achieve\u201d.\nMuch in the same vein, Levi (1986, 246) maintained that \u201can\nagent may terminate deliberation and take decisions without having\nresolved the moral, political, economic and aesthetic conflicts\nrelevant to their predicaments\u201d. \n",
