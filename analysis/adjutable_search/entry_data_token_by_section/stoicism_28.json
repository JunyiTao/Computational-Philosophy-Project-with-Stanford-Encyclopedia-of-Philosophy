To better understand this\nstriking and notorious claim, let us examine how they define the\npassions:\n\n\nThey [the Stoics] say that passion is impulse which is excessive and\ndisobedient to the dictates of reason, or a movement of soul which is\nirrational and contrary to nature; and that all passions belong to the\nsoul\u2019s commanding-faculty. (Stobaeus, 65A)\n\n\nNotice that all passions are impulses (hormai) of a certain\nkind, i.e. psychological events directly prefiguring action, which\n\u201cbelong to the soul\u2019s commanding-faculty\u201d. This\nimplies that all passions are \u201crational impulses\u201d, in the\nStoic scheme (Stobaeus, 53Q), insofar as they are created through the\nexercise of the agent\u2019s rational mind (his\n\u201ccommanding-faculty\u201d), specifically, through an act of\nassent (see\n 2.9\n above). Passions are therefore \u201cirrational\u201d and\n\u201cdisobedient to the dictates of reason\u201d not because they\narise in some part of the mind that lacks reason (like Plato\u2019s\nspirit or appetite), for the Stoics deny that the human mind has any\nnon-rational parts. In what sense, then, do the passions disobey the\ndictates of reason and count as irrational?\n\nOne answer is that, in undergoing a passion, the agent disobeys\nright reason, i.e. the rationality of the cosmos or the\nuniversal law of Zeus. To suffer a passion is to be in conflict with\nnature \u2013 to experience \u201cfluttering\u201d rather than the\n\u201cgood flow\u201d of the happy person (Stobaeus, 65A; cf.\nStobaeus, 63A) \u2013 and is therefore a vicious action par\nexcellence, one that frustrates the agent\u2019s progress\ntowards the telos. To see why, we need to introduce further\naspects of the Stoic account of passions.\n\nInsofar as each passion follows upon the agent\u2019s act of assent,\nit is amenable to a cognitivist analysis. According to the Stoics,\neach passion can be described as an opinion or judgment or weak\nsupposition (65B-D), whose content includes two elements, both of\nwhich (in the standard case) are false: (i) an ascription of value to\nan object that is present or in prospect and (ii) an assessment that a\nparticular course of action is appropriate to perform in response\n(Graver 2007, ch. 2; Brennan 2005, ch. 7; Inwood 1985, ch. 5). In\nstandard cases, (i) is false because the passionate agent mistakes\nsomething he currently possesses or expects to possess as either good\nor bad, when really it is indifferent. So, for instance, the distress\nI feel in learning that I have heart disease involves my mind\u2019s\nassent to the proposition that illness is both present and something\nbad \u2013 where \u201cbad\u201d carries the eudaimonist\nconnotation of being deleterious to my happiness (Cooper 1999b). This\nthought is false, of course: disease is dis-preferred, but not bad,\nand its presence makes no difference to my happiness. My case of\ndistress, then, involves a cognitive failure, according to the Stoics:\nin suffering this passion, I have incorrectly evaluated illness and\nmisjudged its connection to my own personal flourishing. As part of my\ndistress, I may also experience anxious internal constricting and\nstart to weep, as a result of my mind\u2019s assessment that such\nactions are appropriate responses to my present illness (element (ii)\nabove). On the Stoic view, this assessment is also false, for these\nare not objectively appropriate reactions to the presence of something\nbad (cf. the more complicated Alcibiades case, discussed by Graver\n2007, ch. 9).\n\nDistress is one of four main types or genera of passion recognized by\nthe Stoics. Each type is distinguished by the character of its\nintentional object: distress, a present perceived bad; fear, a future\nperceived bad; appetite, a future perceived good; delight (or\npleasure), a present perceived good. Appetite and fear are primary,\nwith distress and delight secondary (Stobaeus, 65A). What is common in\nall four genera, however, is a cognitive mistake on the part of the\nagent concerning the value of the intentional object or concerning the\nappropriate behavioral response \u2013 an epistemic failure that is\nincompatible with living in agreement with nature. This is one\nimportant upshot of Chrysippus\u2019 runner analogy (in Galen, 65J).\nJust as a runner moves in such a way that he is \u201ccarried\naway\u201d and cannot immediately come to a halt, so the passionate\nagent acts on impulses \u201cgoing beyond the rational\nproportion\u201d, i.e. contrary to the right reason of Zeus (Inwood\n1985). However, some commentators see the runner analogy as gesturing\nat a sense in which, for Chrysippus, the passionate agent disobeys her\nown reason as well (Graver 2007, ch. 3). If so, then perhaps\nthe Chrysippean theory can recognize some form of occurrent mental\nconflict after all, although the details of such an interpretation\nhave not yet been worked out.\n\nScholars are divided on how exactly to understand Posidonius\u2019\nreaction to the Chrysippean account of the passions. From the verbatim\nremarks and paraphrases in Galen (65K, M, P, Q), it seems clear that\nPosidonius considered some elements of the Chrysippean account\ninadequate, but whether Posidonius chose merely to emphasize different\naspects of that account, without substantially revising it, or instead\nintended to modify some of its tenets, remains the subject of debate:\nsee Lorenz 2011 and Cooper 1999b.\n\nIn characterizing the ideal human agent as passion-free, what exactly\nare the Stoics denying to her? One might suppose that this ideal\nimplies the eradication of all emotional feelings whatsoever, but the\nStoic account of the virtuous person\u2019s \u201cgood\nfeelings\u201d (eupatheiai) belies the caricature of the\nSage as an unfeeling robot (Diogenes Laertius, 65F). Whereas passions\nare typically directed at indifferents incorrectly judged to be good\nor bad, the Sage\u2019s good feelings are emotional responses to\ngenuine goods, i.e. to virtue, virtuous actions, and virtuous friends\n(see Graver 2007, ch. 2, and Cooper 2005). Moreover, at some point in\nthe school\u2019s history, the Stoics introduced a category of\nfeelings called \u201cpre-emotions\u201d (propatheiai),\nemotional reactions that occur without the intervention of assent and\nso able to be experienced by the Sage without compromising the\nknowledge in which her virtue consists (Gellius, 65Y; for discussion,\nsee Graver 2007, ch. 4).\n",
