Diagrams and Cognition, Applications\n\nDespite the formal limitations of some diagrammatic systems noted\nabove, many different systems are currently used in a wide variety of\ncontexts; logic teaching, automated reasoning, specifying computer\nprograms, reasoning about situations in physics, graphical user\ninterfaces to computer programs, and so on. In general, it is not yet\nknown how effective (in the above sense) many of these diagrammatic\nsystems are. We now give a brief survey of other diagrammatic systems\nand their uses, as well as the more philosophical issues raised by the\ndebate over the status of diagrammatic reasoning. \n",
