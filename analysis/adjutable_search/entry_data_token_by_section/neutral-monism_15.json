    "main_text": "Objections to Neutral Monism || The Mentalism Suspicion\n4.2 The Mentalism Suspicion\n\nThe most frequent type of objection to the traditional versions of\nneutral monism is that they are forms of mentalistic monism: Berkleyan\nidealism, panpsychism, or phenomenalism. The core argument is simple:\nsensations (Mach), pure experience (James) and sensations/percepts\n(Russell) are paradigms of non-neutral, mental entities. Hence there\nis nothing neutral about these neutral monisms. This type of\nobjection\u2014the \u201cmentalism suspicion\u201d\u2014has been\narticulated by a diverse group of philosophers, among them: (Lenin\n1909: 34; Hartshorne 1937: 221\u20132; Stace 1946; Ayer 1971; Feigl\n1958: 426, 1975: 26\u20137; Maxwell 1976: 354; Popper & Eccles\n1977: 199; Strawson 1994: 97; Chalmers 1996: 155; Tully 2003: 355,\n369).\n\nThe prima facie plausibility of this objection is beyond\ndoubt. But Mach, James, and Russell were acutely aware of the problem\nand took themselves to have responded in a satisfactory manner. They\nreject the view that a sensation or an experience consists of a\nsubject directing a mental act\u2014awareness, consciousness,\nacquaintance\u2014onto an object. Dispensing with the subject and the\nact, they are left with what used to be the object\u2014a red patch,\nsay. And they hold that there is nothing intrinsically mental about\nred patches. A red patch becomes a red-sensation simply by being\nappropriately related to other entities of the same kind. There is no\nquick way to adjudicate this dispute; a careful assessment of each\ncase is required. Still, a comparison of neutral monism with its\nclosest mentalist alternatives can be a useful first step.\n\nPanpsychism holds that every basic entity\u2014usually understood as\na physical entity\u2014is also a mental entity. The physical nature\n(if present) and the mental nature of the basic entities are\nfundamental, i.e., irreducible (to each other or to anything else). On\nthe face of it, panpsychism and neutral monism are strikingly\ndifferent. Neutral monism takes mental and physical phenomena to be\nderivative, panpsychism does not; neutral monism holds that basic\nreality is neutral, panpsychism does not. And neutral monism is\ncompatible with the view that most physical objects, and all their\nparts, are absolutely nonmental, whereas panpsychism is not. This is\nhow things look on the Neither View of neutrality. On the\nBoth View of neutrality, things are less clear. The most\nnatural reading of the Both View will, however, not yield\npanpsychism\u2014the view that every basic physical entity has a\nmind\u2014but a dual aspect view\u2014a view according to which\nevery basic entity has a physical and a mental aspect or side. In any\ncase, Mach, James, and Russell resisted panpsychist or dual-aspect\ninterpretations of their views, though there is evidence suggesting\nthat James adopted panpsychism sometime after 1904.\n\nPhenomenalism has been defended as a doctrine about language, about\nfacts, and about things. Taken in this last sense, it attempts to\n\u201creduce material objects to sensa, that is, to explain them as\nconsisting solely of sensa or as being primarily groups or patterns of\nthem\u201d (Hirst 2006: 271). We might substitute the terms\n\u201csense-data\u201d, \u201csensations\u201d,\n\u201cpercepts\u201d, \u201cexperiences\u201d, etc. for\nHirst\u2019s term \u201csensa\u201d. As noted above, the\ntraditional neutral monists supposedly purged such terms of their\nusual intrinsically mental dimension. Moreover, neutral monism is not\nlimited to those entities that are sensations, perceptions, and so\non\u2014this is particularly clear in the case of Mach and Russell.\nThe existence of vast majority of neutral entities is inferred from\nthe minute set of elements that, due to their causal-functional roles,\nhappen to be sensations and perceptions. These inferred elements are\noutside of all minds. These are the strong anti-phenomenalist (and\nanti-idealist) positions. How successfully the various neutral monists\ndefend these claims is, of course, a difficult further question.\n",
